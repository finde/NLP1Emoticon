12:01	<sybariten>	i had like 400 megs in there ... how the kfcu is one supposed to know where to look for files moved to thrash? cause its not visible from the desktop or so, is it?
12:01	<darwin188>	hello, i need some help with ubuntu
12:01	<darwin188>	i just installed it to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
12:01	<amphi>	sybariten: I'd have thought so; I don't use gnome
12:01	<colliier88>	how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
12:02	<hedrek>	!amarok
12:02	<ubotu>	I guess amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/
12:02	<sybariten>	amphi: neither would i... if i was sure i wouldnt lose stuff by changing
12:02	<colliier88>	how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
12:02	<amphi>	sybariten: lose stuff?
12:02	<I_Love_DRM>	Isn't the "thrash can" on the bootom right? next to the 4 desktop screen selectors.
12:02	<Amin>	!bash
12:02	<ubotu>	For a list of basic commands, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands
12:02	<Amin>	!init
12:02	<ubotu>	Init is how Ubuntu starts up misc. system services at boot time.  To control the services, please install the package "BUM" from "Universe" Repository
12:02	<sybariten>	amphi: you know ... uh .. the terminal here in gnome has tabs, and it has choices to change char emulation instantly. could i do that under xfce, etc etc
12:02	<sybariten>	loose stuff like that
12:03	<jayrod06>	!Aac
12:03	<ubotu>	methinks aac is read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for information about aac support
12:03	<crazy_penguin>	night all! // jo ejt!
12:03	<AlwaysIcey>	Yep. I was just about to mention that I_Love_DRM.
12:03	<colliier88>	how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
12:03	<amphi>	sybariten: guess so; just use gnome-terminal I suppose; I use mrxvt for tabbed xterms
12:03	<sybariten>	I_Love_DRM: you have a thrashcan there ?
12:03	<darwin188>	i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
12:03	<darwin188>	can anyone help me out?
12:03	<AlwaysIcey>	I do too.  it looks like a calculator on my screen, but it's a trash can.
12:03	<cr1mson>	How do I correct 'dpkg-deb: subprocess paste killed by signal (Broken pipe)' ?
12:03	<sybariten>	amphi: but i couldnt use gnome-terminal under antyhing but gnome could i
12:04	<amphi>	darwin188: you need to mess with sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg I guess
12:04	<nelisa>	hey folks, newcommer here
12:04	<amphi>	sybariten: why not?
12:04	<cr1mson>	I'm trying to install glibc
12:04	<darwin188>	and then?
12:04	<colliier88>	how do i install belkin f5d7001 on ubuntu
12:04	<CLAUDIA>	hola
12:04	<amphi>	sybariten: AFAIK it's a standalone prog (albeit with a lot of shared lib deps probably)
12:04	<CLAUDIA>	alguien que sepa de linux que me ayude
12:04	<Old>	"rpm -U webmin-1.260-1.noarch.rpm" - this command doesnt seem to work for me, any ideas of how to use a. rpm file?
12:04	<AlwaysIcey>	Claudia, hablas ingles?
12:04	<Old>	I need to install it
12:04	<bimberi>	ompaul: yes i like the new edubuntu background too - although it's a kinda cold and is missing New Zealand (bug reported) :)
12:04	<nelisa>	is there a way to lower my screen resolution, Ubuntu loaded tops and is hard on my eyes
12:04	<CLAUDIA>	no
12:04	<amphi>	!tell CLAUDIA about es
12:04	<AlwaysIcey>	!es
12:04	<ubotu>	Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
12:04	<gnomefreak>	Old: ubuntu is debian not redhat
12:04	<sybariten>	amphi: i thought gnome stuff required gnome as the window manager (althouih its prolly bigger than just a window manager today) to run, just as all K-programs (Kdevelop an all) would require KDE ... etc
12:04	<ompaul>	bimberi, :-)
12:05	<Amin>	!rpm
12:05	<ubotu>	methinks rpm is the Redhat Package Management file. Very similar to Debian's DEB files, but require alien to install. ask me about !alien
12:05	<nelisa>	hola CLAUDIA
12:05	<gnomefreak>	Old: ubuntu uses .debs not .rpms
12:05	<Old>	ooh
12:05	<CLAUDIA>	hola nelisa
12:05	<Amin>	!alien
12:05	<ubotu>	somebody said alien was a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
12:05	<gnomefreak>	CLAUDIA: #ubuntu-es
12:05	<Old>	Is there a way to use .rpms, like renaming it or something?
12:05	<gnomefreak>	Amin: alien isnt really recommended to use
12:05	<amphi>	sybariten: you can run kde progs without kde (you still need the libs), same for gnome; I run gnome progs like gthumb here without gnome
12:05	<gnomefreak>	Old: find a deb
12:05	<Madpilot>	Old, there's "alien", but you should look for a deb first
12:05	<CLAUDIA>	gracias
12:05	<aj_>	how do you add backports to dapper? like so i can get lame debs?
12:05	<amphi>	CLAUDIA: de nada
12:06	<Old>	gnomefreak i cant tbh, this guide is old, and i bet the file isnt on google anymore
12:06	<Old>	I'll look
12:06	<gnomefreak>	Old: what is the app?
12:06	<CLAUDIA>	sabes espaol
12:06	<Madpilot>	aj_, there won't be any backports for Dapper yet - development of the next version hasnt' started yet
12:06	<sybariten>	ok next question ...  if i compile something and then do make install in order to get it in place.... (in this case irssi) .. and i already had that tool installed via apt-get ... will make be able to "overwrite" my old version, and will the apt-system know that i got a new version of the irc client??
12:06	<DBO>	!es

12:06	<sybariten>	amphi: ok didnt know that
12:06	<robertj>	are there any good wiki pages for setting up software mixing of sound?
12:06	<nelisa>	how to lower the res
12:06	<robertj>	I can't get my sdl games & teamspeak to play nice
12:06	<aj_>	so you can't get lame or mythtv in a repo?
12:06	<Old>	gnomefreak, it's webmin, for administrating your counter-strike servers (game servers)
12:07	<Old>	http://mirrors.redwoodvirtual.com/mirrors/www.webmin.com/download.html
12:07	<gnomefreak>	aj_: did you enable universe and multiverse
12:07	<aj_>	yes
12:07	<Old>	Can i use any of those?
12:07	<gnomefreak>	!webmin
12:07	<ubotu>	See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebminWithoutARootAccount for webmin instructions for Ubuntu. Webmin runs on https://localhost:10000 - As of Ubuntu 6.06, webmin is REMOVED from Ubuntu and will no longer be supported
12:07	<disinterseted_pe>	how do i go about finding out about this 'mmsh://a814.l1977144512.c19771.g.lm.akamaistream.net/D/814/19771/v0001/reflector:44512?MSWMExt=.asf'.
12:07	<amphi>	sybariten: some of the integration stuff may not work (those DEs must be for _something_ ;), but the individual profs should work
12:07	<lurk3rX>	dis, thats a windows media player link :p
12:07	<Old>	thanks gnomefreak, i'll just take a peak
12:07	<lurk3rX>	i think
12:08	<AlwaysIcey>	Yep. That's what it is Lurk3rX

12:10	<MENDIGO>	mkdir /var/lib/apt/lists/br.archive.ubuntu.com_ubuntu_dists_breezy-backports_universe_binary-i386_Packages would help?

12:10	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, there's only a resolution there, that's way to high for my miopia
12:10	<coucho>	i can't get vnc server to work properly, again, anyone interested in helping me?
12:10	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, how to get more res enabled?
12:11	<amphi>	MENDIGO: no
12:11	<AlwaysIcey>	One more second nelisa, I'll look at mine.
12:11	<nelisa>	coucho, I've dealed with VNC back in my win days
12:11	<nelisa>	if I get a workable ress I would do better
12:11	<coucho>	nelisa: i'm still in those XD
12:11	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, thanks
12:12	<AlwaysIcey>	nelisa, Try clicking on the arrows next to the resolution.  Tell me if any more options are there.

12:12	<Old>	Full path to perl (default /usr/bin/perl):
12:12	<Old>	Anyone ?
12:12	<mikebot>	anyone know why my mplayer always gives me the error "New_Face failed. Maybe the font path is wrong. Please supply the text font file (~/.mplayer/subfont.ttf)."
12:12	<RandolphCarter>	http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2006/5/21/4048 - bye bye Ballmer :)
12:12	<AlwaysIcey>	How about the refresh rate, what options are there?
12:12	<amphi>	RandolphCarter: he's going somewhere?
12:12	<sybariten>	mikebot: what does google say ?
12:12	<RandolphCarter>	amphi: gotham prison
12:12	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, 60 Hx only
12:12	<RandolphCarter>	mikebot: did you install the mplayer-fonts package?
12:13	<Old>	gnomefreak, read above. Could you help me perhaps?
12:13	<mikebot>	sybariten, RandolphCarter not sure
12:13	<Old>	nice job btw
12:13	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, Resolution 1280x1024
12:13	<coucho>	nelisa: maybe you're able to help me out?
12:13	<gnomefreak>	Old: that should be the path iirc
12:13	<AlwaysIcey>	Is it an older computer nelisa?
12:13	<amphi>	RandolphCarter: ah, the purges begin ;)
12:13	<Old>	gnomefreak, what's the exact path (Im new to ubuntu)
12:13	<nelisa>	it's a laptop an HP Pavilion N5495
12:13	<gnomefreak>	Old: i dont do much with perl except use it in scripts
12:14	<MENDIGO>	nelisa, no, i was going to update to Dapper Drake but then when i saw that would have to download 500mb I choose to Cancel
12:14	<xdica>	hi olks
12:14	<gnomefreak>	Old: /usr/bin/perl
12:14	<mikebot>	RandolphCarter, how do i do that?
12:14	<Nintendud>	I just installed the 686 optimized kernel for Ubuntu, and now mplayer and xmms don't run. if I launch them from the command line, it just says "segmentation fault". I recompiled mplayer, but it still says the same error. any ideas? I tried googling, and maybe the nvidia X driver is related to this problem (I had a bit of a problem getting X to work with the nvidia driver when I installed the kernel, but it eventually worked)
12:14	<guenni>	hallo
12:14	<Old>	cheers gnomefreak
12:14	<RandolphCarter>	mikebot: sudo aptitude install mplayer-fonts
12:14	<mikebot>	RandolphCarter, thanks
12:14	<AlwaysIcey>	I'm not sure then nelisa.  I haven't tried this on a laptop, so I'm not too sure how what resolution options you should have.
12:14	<MENDIGO>	nelisa, I did a backup of the sources.list then i replace it with the backup and did a apt-get update
12:15	<Old>	thanks, It's installing now gnomefreak.
12:15	<HellDragon>	hi , im on a live cd how can i partitionate my HDD
12:15	<HellDragon>	what software i need
12:15	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: you need to install the linux-686 package
12:15	<HellDragon>	ubuntu breezy live cd
12:15	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: I did
12:15	<Nintendud>	;p
12:15	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, how do I poll my hardware for more res options?
12:15	<RandolphCarter>	hmm, so it can't be missing the nvidia kmod :(
12:15	<guenni>	whois guenni
12:15	<Nintendud>	oh wait
12:15	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: looks like I didn't. wtf o_O
12:15	<nelisa>	join #ubuntu-laptop
12:15	<coucho>	i've got ubuntu running at 1280x800 on an acer 3023 with an ati card

12:15	<HellDragon>	Qtparted
12:15	<HellDragon>	wooh
12:16	<sybariten>	anyone here using irssi? please raise a hand
12:16	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: :P np's
12:16	<ruchbah>	>hand<
12:16	<dell500>	anyone here know a bit about raid? specifically raid0
12:16	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: would I have to restart? they still segmentation fault
12:16	<AlwaysIcey>	nelisa, possibly in System >	Administration >	Device Manager.
12:16	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: yup, you'd need to restart
12:16	<sybariten>	ruchbah: can you see if you can do /set term_char ?
12:16	<Nintendud>	thought so
12:16	<Nintendud>	or at least, restart X
12:16	<greg_>	has anyone used automatix?
12:16	<RandolphCarter>	hmm, probably best to reboot
12:16	<coucho>	dell500: depends on what you wanna know
12:16	<Nintendud>	alright
12:16	<Nintendud>	brb
12:16	<amphi>	sybariten: yeah
12:17	<RandolphCarter>	there's some messages about loading restricted modules at startup :) gl
12:17	<Nintendud>	alright, thanks
12:17	<Nintendud>	if I'm not back, all is well
12:17	<sybariten>	amphi: yes you run it or yes you can do /set blabla ?
12:17	<varunvarde2007>	hello all
12:17	<varunvarde2007>	need some help
12:17	<sybariten>	termchar even
12:17	<varunvarde2007>	:(
12:17	<dell500>	coucho, well i have a raid0 array... i made the array with the onboard software (prog that came on the mobo) and i am using it in linux (kubuntu 5.10)
12:17	<varunvarde2007>	hello can anyone help me????????????
12:17	<coucho>	dell500: and what's the problem?
12:18	<dell500>	coucho, what I would like to do is get another large SATA and just back everything up on it, then use the 2 other sata's for OS's
12:18	<amphi>	sybariten: yes I use it ;)
12:18	<ompaul>	!helpme
12:18	<ubotu>	If you do not actually ask a question, we cannot actually help you. :)
12:18	<amphi>	sybariten: "Irssi: Unknown setting term_char" - what's that supposed to do?
12:18	<dell500>	I was just wondering if it's possible to get a new mobo that has more than 2 satas to hook it up so the transfer of 200gb of data to be copied will be faster
12:18	<varunvarde2007>	i want to configure dns server on the Ubuntu Machine can anyone teach me how can i do it??
12:19	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: if you've got a third drive, maybe raid4?
12:19	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, what I'm looking for??
12:19	<coucho>	dell500: why wouldn't it be possible?
12:19	<sybariten>	amphi: solve my problems  :)
12:19	<sybariten>	amphi: according to the bitches in my regular swedish chan
12:19	<amphi>	sybariten: WAYTTD?
12:19	<ruchbah>	sybariten doesn't seem to do anything.  This is the first time I've used irssi.  Just trying it out
12:19	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: and sure, you can always get a PCI SATA-2 card and use linux's software mirroring too
12:19	<dell500>	coucho, i've only got 2 SATA ports for raid
12:20	<varunvarde2007>	anyone there?
12:20	<sybariten>	amphi: what does that abbreviation mean ?
12:20	<RandolphCarter>	it's almost as fast, and you can just put the drives in another machine without it breaking horribly
12:20	<AlwaysIcey>	nelisa, in Device Manager, you'll be looking for the Display Adapter or something similar to that.
12:20	<coucho>	dell500: i understand, but why would it not be possible for you to get a new mobo that supports raid on more than 2 sata ports?
12:20	<sybariten>	ruchbah: ok thanks ... hmmm but did you get an error or not? try a termchar that doesnt exist, like /set term_char banana
12:20	<amphi>	sybariten: !wayttd is <reply>"what are you trying to do?"
12:20	<dell500>	RandolphCarter, my "vision" is to get all the data stored on one SATA drive, then enclose it, use it as USB, then use the RAID0 array (2 120 SATAs) to split up and use for OS
12:20	<darwin188>	i just installed ubuntu to a powermac and I am getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
12:21	<dell500>	coucho, i was wondering if it might destroy the raid array i have now and i would lose all my music and stuff... that wouldn't be good
12:21	<ompaul>	varunvarde2007, http://help.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu/serverguide/en_GB/dns.html
12:21	<darwin188>	can anyone help me out?
12:21	<coucho>	dell500: ah like that
12:21	<varunvarde2007>	thanks checking it out in a second
12:21	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: you won't be able to move the drives to a new mobo
12:21	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: super, mega, definitely not
12:21	<dell500>	ok
12:21	<dell500>	lol
12:21	<greg_>	has anyone had problems using automatix?  specifically firefox
12:21	<RandolphCarter>	and this is the problem with hardware RAID :)
12:21	<sybariten>	amphi: ok, i'm trying to set IRSSI to get the character "emulation" (or whatever you call it) ISO-8859-1 ... aka "western"
12:21	<ruchbah>	sybariten .. nope.  No error.
12:21	<RandolphCarter>	(unless they're not in a RAID atm)
12:21	<ompaul>	varunvarde2007, you will also need to read that howto at the bottom its far too much to do in irc
12:21	<gnomefreak>	greg_: dont use it
12:21	<sybariten>	ruchbah: ok, then it works for you ... dang
12:22	<dell500>	RandolphCarter and coucho, I guess I could just get an enclosure and copy via USB... but 200gb over usb scares me
12:22	<coucho>	dell500: i would advise you to get the disk, and get norton ghost or something to create an image and put that on your new hd
12:22	<greg_>	why not?
12:22	<amphi>	sybariten: no idea about that I'm afraid
12:22	<gnomefreak>	!automatix
12:22	<ubotu>	automatix is, like, totally, unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
12:22	<gnomefreak>	^^^ greg_
12:22	<disinterseted_pe>	this is giving me an anurisum
12:22	<coucho>	dell500: then just undo the array and reinstall everything
12:22	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: wouldn't be so bad, just leave it going overnight, probably take 3-4 hours?
12:22	<phace>	is there a way to check my hard drive. to analyse it for bad sectors etc... it's an external hdd on fat32
12:22	<dell500>	coucho, u can do that?
12:22	<ompaul>	greg_, if you use it, and you break your machine you will reinstall
12:23	<vlad>	anyone know how to make a .deb package of firefox 1.5 from source?
12:23	<`RaSh>	how can i know what ports i have open?
12:23	<amphi>	phace: badblocks
12:23	<gnomefreak>	!ff1.5
12:23	<ubotu>	You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
12:23	<gnomefreak>	vlad: ^^^
12:23	<vlad>	gnomefreak, thanks
12:23	<gnomefreak>	vlad: ywe
12:23	<gnomefreak>	-e
12:23	<greg_>	yeah it did break my machine
12:23	<coucho>	dell500: of course, but everything that was on the array will be gone (or at least not accessible)
12:23	<leojstewart>	Does anyone know the reason why I get this message when I start Synaptic?

12:23	<AlwaysIcey>	Rash, try netstat -an or netstat --help for options
12:23	<greg_>	i lost firefox
12:23	<dell500>	coucho, but that's pretty much a complete backup of it all? how safe is it?
12:24	<PyroMithrandir>	leojstewart, because you don't have your CD in
12:24	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, only video related thing is 82830 CGC
12:24	<coucho>	dell500: i don't think you have to worry about it, unless you get a crappy image maker
12:24	<RandolphCarter>	ghost's very safe, just do an integrity check afterwards
12:24	<coucho>	exactly
12:24	<AlwaysIcey>	I'm not sure what to tell you then nelisa.  Have you tried in the #ubuntu-laptop room?
12:24	<PyroMithrandir>	leojstewart, it should run fine anyway, though
12:24	<dell500>	is there a good one for ubuntu?
12:24	<eugman>	Of course the forums go down right before
12:25	<dell500>	one that doesn't crash? :)
12:25	<eugman>	I make a post.
12:25	<leojstewart>	Pyro: it does. Thank you. I was just wondering
12:25	<coucho>	dell500: most of those work outside an OS
12:25	<coucho>	dell500: ghost does anyway
12:25	<leojstewart>	I wasn't doing it before... I wonder why it is now.
12:25	<dell500>	ohhhh
12:25	<dell500>	gotcha
12:25	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: tar | bzip is farely safe and doesn't crash :)
12:25	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, they sent me back to #ubuntu
12:25	<RandolphCarter>	*fairly
12:25	<dell500>	RandolphCarter, I've had some problems with tar'ing things
12:25	<dell500>	idk why
12:26	<eugman>	Nelisa, You need to find a way to make the equivalent of a conference call it would seem.
12:26	<PyroMithrandir>	leojstewart, if you don't want to see that error, you can comment out the line from /etc/apt/sources.lst that checks the CD
12:26	<coucho>	dell500: i would get ghost, you can boot up and just copy your entire hd array to your new disk
12:26	<eugman>	But seriously, I hope you get help.
12:26	<dbcalo>	can i open terminals so they're already set to the folder i want them to be in?
12:26	<leojstewart>	Pyro: sorry, but I'm a linux-newbie.  Could you tell me exactly how to do this?
12:26	<RandolphCarter>	ghost only works with ext2/ext3 atm though (don't think it works with reiser)
12:27	<coucho>	dell500: i would probably allocate that disk first
12:27	<AlwaysIcey>	The only other place I could recommend is maybe the accessibility chat room.  Otherwise, I'll leave it up to someone else here, since I haven't configured Devices manually or used a laptop with Ubuntu.
12:27	<coucho>	dell500: which fs do you use?
12:27	<Nintendud>	:(
12:27	<Nintendud>	didn't work
12:27	<Nintendud>	still segmentation faults
12:27	<PyroMithrandir>	leojstewart, you can do it in synaptic. open it up and go settings>repositories
12:27	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: erk :/
12:28	<jlunder>	Hey, I have a little question about getting new hardware working in an existing ubuntu breezy installation, I was hoping someone here could help?
12:28	<PyroMithrandir>	then uncheck the "CD disk with Ubuntu..."
12:28	<eugman>	dbcalo , How do you define the ones you want them to be in? Do you want to pick them from nautilus or do you want the terminal to have a different default or something else?
12:28	<amphi>	!tell jlunder about ask
12:28	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: then again, I probably should have watched that apt-get more carefully; since it didn't have any dependencies to install, so I think everything in that respect was up to date
12:28	<Ademan>	when i try and shut down ubuntu on my laptop it just goes blank screen and nothing happens, none of the diagnostic messages "shutting down root file system" or anything, just blank screen, never powers down either.  What do you guys think is wrong?
12:28	<Tuzlo>	php5 and gd lib support, what do I have to do to ensure that  php is compiled with GD lib support/?
12:28	<Nintendud>	since apt-get install linux-686 only downloaded a 22.4KB file ;p
12:29	<HellDragon>	hi, how can i install LILO from a live cd , i just broke grub and ill install lilo to replace it
12:29	<HellDragon>	:(
12:29	<Old>	anyone got any ideas of how to remove the other modules from webmin ?
12:29	<Nintendud>	man, I can't live without mplayer
12:29	<HellDragon>	http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration doing that doesnt work
12:29	<dbcalo>	eugman, i was hoping i could open them up with nautilus. i remember i used to be able to do such a thing but have since forgotten how to do so.
12:29	<Nintendud>	xmms I don't care much about, unless I want to spam music in IRC
12:29	<amphi>	Nintendud: heh
12:29	<Blissex>	HellDragon: there are plenty of other GRUB tutorials/HOWTOs...
12:29	<coucho>	what's the disk info command again?
12:29	<Nintendud>	but still
12:29	<Nintendud>	:/
=== Sir_Squirrel is now known as McScruff
12:29	<`RaSh>	can anyone tell why im able to send in AMSN but im not able to send here in IRC
12:29	<HellDragon>	but i want to use lilo
12:29	<HellDragon>	not grub anymore
12:29	<darwin188>	how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
12:29	<HellDragon>	it always break
12:29	<ruchbah>	jlunder - what have you got?
12:30	<HellDragon>	every week it breaks
12:30	<Blissex>	`RaSh: some channels require you to have a registered user name.
12:30	<darwin188>	i will appreciate a lot the help
12:30	<amphi>	HellDragon: you boot every week??
12:30	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: hmm :/ not sure what I can recommend
12:30	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: :(
12:30	<coucho>	what's the disk info command again?
12:30	<HellDragon>	amphi, every day
12:30	<`RaSh>	its not here.
12:30	<leojstewart>	PyroMithrandir: worked perfectly. Thank you!
12:30	<amphi>	HellDragon: strewth
12:30	<PyroMithrandir>	leojstewart, no problem :)
12:30	<Nintendud>	so, can anyone help me with my problem? after installing the 686 optimized kernel, mplayer and xmms only respond with a "segmentation fault" when I run them from the command line
12:30	<eugman>	dbcalo, Well I'm guessing you could do something with nautilus scripts and the cd command. Or copy the folder and then open a terminal and type cd and then paste the location into it but that's no fun.
12:30	<Dr_Willis>	darwin188,  sounds like you need to reconfigure your X server properly. perhaps install the nvidia or ati drivers. depending on your video card.
12:30	<HellDragon>	i dont know what to do now
12:30	<HellDragon>	i can only boot on a live cd
12:30	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: they don't even give you any other output? :/
12:31	<jlunder>	Right, so I just put a new CD burner in this machine. It shows up in "Computer" but as a regular CD-ROM, and I can't burn anything through the nautilus interface. Is there some magic I need to invoke to get things working?
12:31	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: nope
12:31	<darwin188>	but i dont even have a graphical interface
12:31	<coucho>	what's the disk info command again?
12:31	<Nintendud>	nintendud@johnspc:~$ mplayer
12:31	<Nintendud>	Segmentation fault
12:31	<Nintendud>	BAM
12:31	<varunvarde2007>	ok thanks everyone
12:31	<Nintendud>	same with xmms
12:31	<varunvarde2007>	maybe  iw ill come tomorrow for help
12:31	<varunvarde2007>	thakns
12:31	<darwin188>	how do i reconfigure the the xserver?
12:31	<varunvarde2007>	bye all
12:31	<Nintendud>	which is why I was so confused
12:31	<Nintendud>	;p
12:31	<Dr_Willis>	!reconfigure
12:31	<ubotu>	I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Dr_Willis
12:31	<Perkin>	hello, i'm having a problem...
12:31	<amphi>	Nintendud: you could try running it under gdb and see if that gives you any idea
12:31	<coucho>	what's the disk info command again?
12:31	<Dr_Willis>	!fixres
12:31	<ubotu>	Help to fix the display resolution is available at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/FixVideoResolutionHowto
12:31	<Nintendud>	gdb?
12:31	<Perkin>	how can i manage the services of the system?
12:31	<Nintendud>	I've never heard of that
12:31	<RandolphCarter>	lol, I was just thinking that
12:31	<RandolphCarter>	it's the GNU Debugger
12:31	<amphi>	coucho: what disk info command? df ?
12:31	<dbcalo>	eugman, i'll keep looking into. i know last time i used linux there was a drop down menu it was in if you were looking at the contents a folder.
12:32	<coucho>	amphi: finally, thanks
12:32	<tronus>	i keep getting "error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0" whenever i run quake4 or, im assuming, any other program thats uses SDL.  I have it installed and linked in ld.so.conf and it still does it?
12:32	<Old>	how do i create a user with the permission like a root user? (ex i want the user: warlock to have full rights like a root user does)
12:32	<AlwaysIcey>	nelisa: I may have a workaround for you, although it's not a solution.
12:32	<Nintendud>	RandolphCarter: alright, I ran gdb, now what do I do? ;p
12:32	<eugman>	Old, may I ask why?
12:32	<amphi>	Nintendud: run mplayer under gdb, and when it crashes, do bt to get a stack trace, and see if you see anything enlightening
12:32	<ompaul>	!tell Old about root
12:32	<amphi>	Nintendud: are you using proprietary nvidia X drivers, BTW? ;)
12:32	<RandolphCarter>	Nintendud: you need to run 'gdb mplayer'
12:32	<Madpilot>	Old, your first user - the one you created during install - has full sudo privs - you can give any subsequently created users the same
12:32	<Old>	eugman, im installing webmin, and it needs a account to start my gameservers, i dont want to use the root account
12:33	<lumpster>	i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
12:33	<RandolphCarter>	then type 'run' and wait for a crash
12:33	<Nintendud>	amphi: if you mean if I'm using "nvidia" instead of "nv", then yes
12:33	<Old>	I only created 'root' there :-(
12:33	<RandolphCarter>	(press return too)
12:33	<ruchbah>	helldragon .. I've had problems with grub which I solved by booting a live cd then going into the /bin (? /usr/bin ?) of the hd install and running grub-install from there.  There was more to it than that, but that was the gist.  Does that sound like something to explore for your situation?
12:33	<ompaul>	Old, no it does not - this is ubuntu
12:33	<Madpilot>	Old, read the webmin page on the Ubuntu wiki
12:33	<Perkin>	sorry, i'm trying to manage the services of ubuntu, how can i do that?
12:33	<Nintendud>	I need nvidia for dual screens
12:33	<amphi>	Nintendud: you can do 'file /usr/bin/mplayer' at the gdb prompt, and then 'run'
12:33	<Old>	ompaul, huh?
12:33	<ompaul>	Old, read the web page that ubotu sent you as a message
12:33	<AlwaysIcey>	nelisa: If you go into System >	Preferences >	Assistive Technology Support, you can enable the magnifier and a few other options.  If nothing else, that will help until you get a solution.
12:33	<Knorrie>	Old: you do not want a web program to have root priviliges, webmin == evil
12:33	<Old>	disabling root account, I dont want that..
12:33	<Old>	oh
12:33	<Old>	but..
12:33	<Dr_Willis>	Perkin,  could read up on how the SysV init system works.. if thats what you are refering to.. theres also gui front ends to manage what gets started when.
12:33	<Nintendud>	amphi: did it, but uh... weird output o_O
12:34	<Old>	what user should i use then?!
12:34	<ompaul>	Old, no buts read the web page
12:34	<amphi>	Nintendud: that might be what's breaking mplayer and xmms - someone had a similar problem yesterday; you could check if using the nv driver makes the problem go away
12:34	<Old>	k, let me read it
12:34	<Nintendud>	amphi: I need dual monitors though!
12:34	<Nintendud>	:(
12:34	<Nintendud>	and, I believe nvidia is necessary for that, right? :P
12:34	<Knorrie>	Old: what's wrong with teh good old command line to start services?
12:34	<Nintendud>	I had no problem with the 386 kernel and nvidia
12:34	<amphi>	Nintendud: *shrug* - trying with nv would at least show if that was the cause of the proble,
12:34	<Nintendud>	it's just this one
12:34	<Nintendud>	:/
12:34	<maike-maus>	hello. can anybody help me getting my network / internet working?
12:34	<amphi>	er, problem
12:35	<Nintendud>	alright, I'll try it
12:35	<Nintendud>	hold on, editing xorg config

12:35	<ubotu>	from memory, commands is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicCommands or http://www.linuxcommand.org/
12:35	<Perkin>	Dr_Willis: i saw that i can manage the main services, like schedules, with something called gnome-services or similar. do you know that?
12:35	<Old>	Knorrie, im new to ubuntu, mind explaining a little more ?
12:35	<Nintendud>	or should I show you gdb's output first, amphi ?
12:35	<Old>	I always use the root account, I dont dare to disable it
12:35	<Knorrie>	maike-maus: you're on irc without a network connection? :P
12:35	<Dr_Willis>	Perkin,  im old skool and normally twiddle the rc.d links myself.

12:35	<amphi>	?
12:35	<redguy>	Old: that is not very wise
12:35	<darwin188>	how do i make my newly installed ubuntu system to work...i keep getting an error message saying that the xserver cant start
12:35	<Nintendud>	amphi: um, gdb says: Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

12:36	<amphi>	!pastebin
12:36	<ubotu>	it has been said that pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
12:36	<Old>	I dont feel like reading a story about some people swearing to each other Knorrie.
12:36	<Knorrie>	Old: bofh is fun
12:36	<Nintendud>	ah, I was wondering what that was
12:36	<Knorrie>	Old: but anyway..
12:36	<darwin188>	yes but how do i do that
12:37	<Old>	No, Im christian. I dont see those things being 'fun' to me. - sorry.
12:37	<HellDragon>	spam spam spam
12:37	<Knorrie>	Old: heh i'm too
12:37	<amphi>	Nintendud: pastebin it and paste the url in here - is there an openGL line near the top of the bt?
12:37	<Old>	Let me read it ompaul
12:37	<Old>	again.
12:37	<coucho>	darwin188: did you look through the manual yet?
12:37	<RandolphCarter>	bofh isn't really swearing :/
12:37	<darwin188>	i dont have a manual
12:37	<Nintendud>	amphi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14418
12:37	<darwin188>	i jsut have a cd
12:37	<HellDragon>	tpektoerjtre9j
12:37	<Nintendud>	amphi: that contains the error messages from run too
12:37	<ompaul>	Old, read that web page again, running as root is bad, it opens you to attacks in individual clients and gives too much power to applications that should not be trusted
12:37	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, upping the fonts helped loads
12:38	<AlwaysIcey>	Glad to hear that nelisa :D
12:38	<nelisa>	question 2, whay are there black borders on the screen?
12:38	<Nintendud>	amphi: it says glXChannelRectSyncSGIX ;p
12:38	<amphi>	Nintendud: yeah, looks like the same problem - $SMALL_SUM says switching to the nv xorg driver will make this problem go away
12:38	<Old>	Alright ompaul, Like im said. Im new to ubuntu and im trying to run applications as easy as possible, and as smoothly as possible. I'm not much of a googler to look for ways to get around not-using root.
12:38	<coucho>	darwin188: help.ubuntu.com / wiki.ubuntu.com
12:38	<AlwaysIcey>	I'm not sure about that at all.  Maybe someone else can answer it.
12:38	<Nintendud>	amphi: but, how will I use dual monitors?
12:38	<darwin188>	i already tried that not a lot of help
12:39	<Nintendud>	I don't think there is a way to do that under nv
12:39	<darwin188>	refers to this channel
12:39	<Perkin>	ok, i'll see in another way
12:39	<Knorrie>	Old: what gameservers are you running.. just curious :)
12:39	<amphi>	Nintendud: no idea - perhaps reinstalling the nvidia driver will fix it, dunno; it'd be worth checking that the problem goes away with the nv driver, as I grow weary of saying
12:39	<Nintendud>	alright, I'll check that first
12:39	<Nintendud>	I'll be back
12:40	<Old>	Knorrie, counter-strike servers, I work for alot of companies, and communitys. I know the basic in ubuntu to run game-servers, but im interested im learning more so i can do more with my game-servers.
12:40	<ompaul>	Old, that page says use sudo, if you want to install something it asks you for your password that is all, no one can brute force your root account that way, I could stay here all night doing one liners, take it as read it is a bad idea, or research it on ww.securityfocus.com
12:40	<Old>	well, brute forcing my password is impossible.
12:40	<coucho>	darwin188: k wait a second
12:41	<Knorrie>	Old: sorry to ask, but why do you complain about a sarcastic sysadmin story, and run games where people shoot each other, i dont get it
12:41	<ompaul>	Old, if the machine is compromised through the game server you will have only yourself to blame for running it as root, and personally I think you should go and do some research to understand what is wrong with running applicaitons as root
12:41	<darwin188>	thanks
12:41	<Dr_Willis>	games where people talk and help each other are too much  like IRC :P
12:41	<Knorrie>	Dr_Willis: heh
12:42	<dgl>	hi people, what is more secure way to set up an subversion server? Inetd or an script that initialize it on booting time?
12:42	<lumpster>	i want to give multiple user read/write access to a dir. ive created a symlink to this dir in each of their home dirs. each user belongs to the same group as the dir. and the perms on the dir were set with 'chmod 1660 dir_name'. why doesnt this work?
12:42	<ompaul>	Dr_Willis, can we quote you on that?
12:42	<sybariten>	what _is_ a subversion server ?
12:42	<Dr_Willis>	ompaul,  :P sure.. im allready on tht bash.org site a few times
12:42	<Knorrie>	dgl: i use subversion and apache2 with the subversion-module
12:42	<Old>	Knorrie, I'm sorry to answer your questiong and you wasting my time litterly when im busy trying to sort out webmin.

12:42	<Knorrie>	Old: no offence
12:43	<Old>	Dont.. please
12:43	<dell500>	RandolphCarter and coucho, thanks for the help... btw, if you have a USB hd, you can ghost the image over to the usb from the raid0 array, right?
12:43	<sybariten>	hm, nothing for a guy who hasnt learned to use cvs yet i guess
12:43	<dgl>	Knorrie, man, i will use lighttpd and I know that there is a way to do something like it with lighttpd
12:43	<coucho>	dell500: that should be the case
12:43	<ompaul>	sybariten, a software server for moving data and keeping things in sync
12:43	<coucho>	dell500: as long as it's been allocated
12:43	<coucho>	dell500: you're welcome btw
12:43	<Old>	Im not having an attitude, but I'm really having it tough finding a work, And i get paid for this. As long as i get paid i do whatever it takes so get money so i can make a living.
12:43	<sybariten>	ompaul: that much i know
12:43	<dell500>	k... is there any other ghost image creators out there besides norton?
12:43	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: aye, good luck
12:43	<dell500>	thanks :)
12:43	<bobbyd>	Old, it's literally...
12:43	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: nope, ghost's proprietary
12:44	<amphi>	Old: your blood pressure... ;)
12:44	<RandolphCarter>	dell500: I'm not sure how easy it'd be to ghost onto a USB drive
12:44	<coucho>	dell500: what he said
12:44	<dell500>	hmm... i'll find it somewhere
12:44	<sybariten>	ompaul: just got the impression that subversion was the "new and fancier" type of CVS, and hence nothing i should look into

12:45	<RandolphCarter>	coucho: hmm, okay, but afaik it relies on the DOS drivers, and I'm yet to see a DOS USB-HDD driver
12:46	<ompaul>	Knorrie, I will not have people mentioning plesk in this channel I am trying to recover :-)
12:46	<jonuk>	Hey everyone.  I'm very new to Ubuntu, and just now got it installed on my computer.  I installed it on a 250GB hard drive.  I gave 10GB to /root 20GB to /home and 1GB to /swap (i know thats a lot).  I ran into problems when trying to format the remaining 219 GB as FAT32, so I just left it as free space.  Now I want to format it so that I can share files between Linux and Windows.  What's the best way to create this partition?
12:46	<dell500>	2005 is 9.0, so i think 2006 is 10.
12:46	<RandolphCarter>	Knorrie: aye, what's so bad about ssh?
12:46	<HellDragon>	can anyone help me :(
12:46	<Old>	ompaul, I created a user, and gave it a password. Is that all?
12:46	<Knorrie>	RandolphCarter: ssh isn't bad, did i say that?
=== subsinker is now known as sub|at|alpopel
12:46	<spacey>	jonuk: 219GB is way to big for fat32
12:46	<amphi>	jonuk: cfdisk is pretty easy
12:46	<RandolphCarter>	nope, kinda agreeing and diss'ing webmin for being pointless
12:46	<Knorrie>	!comfort ompaul
12:46	<ubotu>	I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Knorrie
12:46	<ompaul>	Old, that is all there is too it, if you need to run a command in a terminal, sudo command and it asks for your password
12:46	<coucho>	RandolphCarter: true, but i believe that it works after the usb driver has been loaded
12:47	<HellDragon>	:((((((((((((((
12:47	<Old>	Or should i disable the root usage aswell, If so. Is this user account i created -safe- to use for my gameservers and my webserver, so i can administrate them?
12:47	<eugman>	+p isn't the limit for fat around 137 gb?
12:47	<RandolphCarter>	coucho: yeah, it should
12:47	<Briguy>	I have two cdrom drives installed, where can I find what they're known as?
12:47	<Knorrie>	HellDragon: you're a dragon from hell, you shouldn't :(((((((
12:47	<Old>	ompaul, so when i login with putty i will be using my new account i created instead of root in the future?
12:47	<ruchbah>	jonuk wheres your /? /lib /etc ????
12:47	<coucho>	RandolphCarter/dell500: i would have to check be sure though
12:47	<RandolphCarter>	Briguy: cat /etc/fstab
12:47	<amphi>	Briguy: ide?
12:48	<coucho>	darwin188: try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
12:48	<Briguy>	ty
12:48	<Old>	There's a -bunch- of hours and work on this server, I wouldn't feel too good if i messed it up by disabling the root account.

12:48	<HellDragon>	root@0[knoppix] # grub-install
12:48	<HellDragon>	install_device not specified.
12:48	<jonuk>	so I can use CDISK to make partitions?
12:48	<RandolphCarter>	Old: you can always fix it by chrooting in from a livecd
12:48	<buzzed>	any thoughts on running ubuntu on a T43p Thinkpad?
12:48	<Knorrie>	dgl: i'm running a dedicated apache2 install somewhere to server subversion repo's, just because the svn people made a apache-module like http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/libapache2-svn
12:48	<HellDragon>	im on a livecd
12:48	<amphi>	jonuk: cfdisk, yes
12:48	<jonuk>	spacey:  what's the standard size for a FAT32 partition?
12:49	<Old>	Ah, I know. But i have a few things todo on my spare time, and i dont feel like going down to the server just to fix that :-)
12:49	<spacey>	jonuk: maximum size you mean? i don't know, google it:)
12:49	<ompaul>	Old, if you gave root a password and installed software and let it run as root all bets are off its reinstall time sorry but that is how I view it
12:49	<amphi>	jonuk: 1.44 MB ;)
12:49	<HellDragon>	kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
12:49	<jonuk>	maximmum size, yes
12:49	<ompaul>	HellDragon, what?
12:49	<RandolphCarter>	jonuk: the max FAT32 partition size is 2TiB
12:49	<nelisa>	AlwaysIcey, bunch of unknown devices in dev manager, where to look at first?

12:49	<ruchbah>	you say a 250gb drive, w/ 10gb for /root, 20gb for home and 1gb for swap, with the rest unformated, where's the rest of your instalation?  Whaeres your root partition?  Is this up and running?
12:49	<HellDragon>	how the hell can i reinstall grub
12:49	<HellDragon>	grub-install doesnt work
12:49	<buzzed>	looking at this deal for a durable high res ubuntu box... http://tinyurl.com/o2lym
12:49	<tronus>	can somebody help me with a library location problem im having
12:49	<Knorrie>	HellDragon: let me try to help you
12:50	<amphi>	HellDragon: you didn't specify the device
12:50	<HellDragon>	http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/installation/grub#restauration i tried that , didnt work
12:50	<Old>	ompaul, but cant i like..remove the root account, or perhaps disable it from people accessing it?
12:50	<HellDragon>	i see a smiley when i boot
12:50	<HellDragon>	no menu with kernel list and windows
12:50	<RandolphCarter>	buzzed: man, that's pricey, my PowerBook was less than that
12:50	<jonuk>	2 terabytes?  why didn't a 219gb partition work then
12:50	<HellDragon>	amphi : how can i specify it
12:50	<I_Love_DRM>	I just installed 3ddesktop - how do i run it?
12:50	<RandolphCarter>	jonuk: where you formatting it in Windows?
12:50	<ompaul>	HellDragon, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/grub gives a few pages that you can try I am off to bed in two minutes
12:50	<RandolphCarter>	*were
12:50	<amphi>	HellDragon: what partition is your ubuntu install /
12:50	<amphi>	?
12:50	<Knorrie>	HellDragon: you're on a live cd, can you mount your ubuntu partition somewhere under /mnt ?
12:50	<jonuk>	i can format it in either linux or windows
12:50	<buzzed>	is your PB UXGA?
12:50	<HellDragon>	i dont know amphi
12:51	<HellDragon>	Knorrie, i dont know im lost
12:51	<Knorrie>	HellDragon: dont panic
12:51	<rocky_>	hello
12:51	<amphi>	HellDragon: pastebin the output of 'fdisk -l /dev/hda'
12:51	<HellDragon>	how can you dont panic with all the spam
12:51	<HellDragon>	ook
12:51	<RandolphCarter>	well, windows won't like formatting a large drive, but mkdosfs /dev/*drive**partition* should work
12:51	<amphi>	HellDragon: spam?
12:51	<HellDragon>	nothing
12:51	<HellDragon>	fdisk -l /dev/hda says nothing
12:51	<RandolphCarter>	oh, sudo mkdosfs..
12:51	<jonuk>	well, how about this
12:51	<ompaul>	Old, the page tells you how to, however if a program is running as root one of these game servers your talking about then *all bets are off* the risk of a compromise is too high
12:51	<ompaul>	Old, and with that I am gone, good night.
12:51	<ruchbah>	Knorrie HellDragon -- I've done that for a similar thing.  Had ubuntu on hd and booted dsl.  Mounted.  Ran grub-install.
12:52	<buzzed>	RandolphCarter: PB 15 in. UXGA?
12:52	<RandolphCarter>	buzzed: 12", for Uni lectures ^_^
12:52	<amphi>	HellDragon: sata hd?
12:52	<Old>	Oh well, Is there a high risc of people hacking theirselfs into my system?
12:52	<jonuk>	I'll make a 20GB FAT32 partition, to let me read/write files in either linux or windows.  Then I'll make the rest just NTFS, so I can at least read the files in Linux
12:52	<hyphenated>	RandolphCarter: he'll need -F 32 to get anything larger than 2GB or so
12:52	<HellDragon>	amphi: yes
12:52	<RandolphCarter>	hyphenated: it'll automagic that
12:52	<amphi>	HellDragon: now you say so...
12:52	<Knorrie>	Old: not even people, there are lots of automated botnets that try to do that all the time
12:52	<RandolphCarter>	ack, no it won't, you need -F 32 :( (my bad)
12:52	<amphi>	HellDragon: fdisk -l /dev/sda perhaps

12:54	<Nintendud>	same problem :(
12:54	<Old>	Knorrie, Hmmm.. But if i change the root password to something extremly hard then?
12:54	<bung>	amphi: it works on the livecd iirc

12:55	<Old>	woah - wait a second. Could someone take that again? Should i change the root pass to something hard (I'll write it down) to prevent brute forcing(?)
12:56	<amphi>	Nintendud: well, it would appear not to be your nvidia driver, so you can have your monitors back ;)
12:56	<Nintendud>	mugzie: yes, but that's irrelevant to my problem
12:56	<Nintendud>	amphi: yeah, but.. now what?
12:56	<mugzie>	why
12:56	<amphi>	HellDragon: ls mnt shows you files and directories ?
12:56	<HellDragon>	yes
12:56	<amphi>	HellDragon: that's 'ls mnt'
12:56	<mugzie>	is there bittorrent on ubuntu?

01:00	<negman>	coucho - what are the useful programs?  i've not even heard of it.
01:00	<coucho>	negman: harware testing tools, partitioning tools, backup tools, things like that

01:06	<MorbidHunger>	i have an s3trio i want to use
01:06	<HellDragon>	ok i reboot
01:06	<HellDragon>	brb
01:06	<amphi>	HellDragon: for now rembember your ubuntu / fs is /dev/sda7 - or is sda8? ;)
01:06	<breeden>	well, this is a fresh install of ubuntu, and I'm really not a linux user.  But ubuntu's default application add hasn't been of any help
01:06	<breeden>	I haven't tried synaptic yet
01:06	<breeden>	I don't think its install though
01:07	<breeden>	ok, I think I see the problem
01:07	<breeden>	thanks
01:07	<tronus>	I have a 64bit system but quake4 needs 32 bit libsdl files... where can i get those?
01:07	<Madpilot>	breeden, Synaptic should be at System->Admin->Synaptic
01:07	<linuxbomb>	hey whats that program to adjust the brightness of xv
01:07	<breeden>	I had synaptic already open, hopefully this should fix the problem
01:08	<breeden>	it worked, thanks alot :)
01:09	<amphi>	breeden: that's why the package managers use the lock, so they don't clobber each other ;)
01:09	<soundray>	maike-maus: knoppix? That's bad news...
01:09	<lss>	Hi, I really need to LAN card working on my laptop, but it doesn't tell me the model name. Is there a tool for this?.. Thanks a lot.
01:09	<HellDragon>	im back amphi
01:10	<HellDragon>	i stil see a smiley
01:10	<amphi>	HellDragon: yes, grub-install failed, so no surprise there
01:10	<maike-maus>	hi soundray
01:10	<coucho>	lss: what kind of laptop?
01:10	<HellDragon>	but wtf with the smiley ^
01:10	<HellDragon>	grub is laughing at me ^
01:10	<amphi>	lss: lspci might tell you
01:10	<lss>	coucho,  it's a gateway MX3220b.
01:10	<soundray>	maike-maus: how are you getting on?
01:10	<breeden>	amphi, yeah I've seen it happen with FreeBSD's porting system
01:10	<dgl>	Hi, what inetd should I use: openbsd-ined or xinetd?
01:11	<HellDragon>	can i panic now
01:11	<coucho>	lss: sorry never heard of those, don't know what lan card they have
01:11	<amphi>	lss: did you try lspci?
01:11	<lss>	coucho,  it's a "Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102"
01:11	<maike-maus>	soundray: network / internet doesn't want to work :(
01:11	<amphi>	lss: you may find info at linux-laptop.net and/or tuxmobil.org
01:11	<coucho>	lss: i think you've got it right there
01:12	<lss>	coucho,  thanks, amphi  thanks too
01:12	<coucho>	lss: yw
01:12	<HellDragon>	AAAAAAAAAAAH lets scream up and down
01:12	<soundray>	maike-maus: same problem as ~20 hours ago?
01:12	<breeden>	dgl, to my understanding xinetd is not backwards compatible with inetd...  It would require some manual tunning if you were planning on running a server that didn't support xinetd directly, I believe
01:12	<amphi>	HellDragon: 'when in doubt, run in circles, scream & shout' ;)
01:12	<coucho>	lol
01:12	<HellDragon>	grub is dead!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAH!
01:13	<dgl>	breeden, ok, so u should use openbsd-inetd?
01:13	<coucho>	rofl
01:13	<amphi>	HellDragon: how did you trash your mbr?
01:13	<maike-maus>	soundray: yes, xserver working but network still down
01:13	<breeden>	dgl, if you aren't planning on running any servers or anything like that you probably wont notice the difference, I would go with inetd
01:13	<breeden>	openbsd's
01:13	<soundray>	maike-maus: does the net work when you boot a live CD?
01:13	<HellDragon>	amphi : with partition magic on windows
01:13	<HellDragon>	i tried to resize J
01:13	<HellDragon>	its a NTFS part
01:14	<maike-maus>	soundray: ubuntu live cds doesn't boot... I tried with kanotix, this works great...
01:14	<dgl>	brentd, sorry, but I am a little confused about the packges names
01:14	<acid-trip>	anyone familiar with dovecot mail?
01:14	<soundray>	maike-maus: with ubuntu live, is it the freeze at hotplug?
01:15	<amphi>	HellDragon: ah... the curse of proprietary sw is upon you
01:15	<HellDragon>	:(
01:15	<HellDragon>	qtparted doesnt detect J
01:15	<HellDragon>	it says its full of errors..etc
01:15	<HellDragon>	so i tried with part magic
01:15	<dgl>	brentd, what packages offer inetd? I supose openbsd-inetd and xinetd, is there others packages?
01:15	<Old>	root@server:/home/cs/warservers/speedlink# ./update.sh
01:15	<Old>	./update.sh: line 2: ./steam: No such file or directory
01:15	<dgl>	brentd, , what packages offer inetd? I supose openbsd-inetd and xinetd, is there others packages?
01:15	<Old>	what's the problem?
01:15	<leojstewart>	Does anyone know why my Gmail Notifier is buggy?
01:15	<Old>	The file is there..
01:15	<Old>	oh
01:15	<Old>	one second :-)
01:16	<Madpilot>	Old, ease up on your Enter key a bit, please
01:16	<maike-maus>	soundray, no some problem wit i/o and pci (dapper)  - at hoary everything is fine until the splash screen- then the system freezes
01:16	<acid-trip>	does anyone know about imap and pop3?
01:16	<amphi>	!tell acid-trip about ask
01:17	<KenSentMe>	acid-trip: what do you want to know?
01:17	<nickrud>	acid-trip, I don't use it's pop3, but the imap is easy
01:17	<acid-trip>	KenSentMe, i have dovecot installed through package
01:17	<acid-trip>	but it the servers wont send or receive my emails
01:17	<HellDragon>	amphi can you help me in pm
01:17	<HellDragon>	theres too much spam ehre
01:17	<leojstewart>	My Gmail Notifier tray icon does weird things... like disappearing.  Anyone know why?
01:17	<soundray>	maike-maus: I guess I've been really lucky with my Turion laptop from Aldi. Almost everything worked straight away, including the Xpress 200 graphics... I'll stay away from Packard Bell, that's for sure.
01:18	<lss>	Im really confused. I think i have got the driver now, and the drivers file name is "via-rhine.c" and I have no idea how to install it. Thanks
01:18	<andrejkw>	I might open a new site for Ubuntu Guides (Breezy and up), anyone have a suggestion for a name? I might also be looking for staff, anyone interested?
01:18	<KenSentMe>	acid-trip: i've installed a pop3 and imap server myself using this howto: http://workaround.org/articles/ispmail-sarge/
01:18	<makelele>	how do remove modules ? i am trying to remove the fglrx module -not sure how to though
01:18	<_ClouD_>	hi, i have so ubuntu but i can't see dvd movies
01:18	<_ClouD_>	what can i do?
01:18	<KenSentMe>	acid-trip: it's written for Debian Sarge but works for Ubuntu (Dapper)
01:18	<andrejkw>	I might open a new site for Ubuntu Guides (Breezy and up), anyone have a suggestion for a name? I might also be looking for staff, anyone interested?
01:18	<acid-trip>	i dont' ahve dapper
01:18	<acid-trip>	i have badger
01:19	<KenSentMe>	acid-trip: works for breezy too
01:19	<_antix>	andrejkw: what's wrong with the wiki?
01:19	<amphi>	!tell _ClouD_ about dvd
01:19	<amphi>	pfft
01:19	<soundray>	leojstewart: I don't use that program, but are you sure it doesn't disappear by design? Like, when you have no new mail?
01:19	<acid-trip>	lol amphi
01:20	<_ClouD_>	what is the spanish channel?
01:20	<KenSentMe>	How can i add a dutch spellchecker to OpenOffice?
01:20	<amphi>	#ubuntu-es
01:20	<KenSentMe>	!es
01:20	<ubotu>	Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
01:20	<leojstewart>	soundray: no, I'm pretty sure it's a bug.  Like half of the icon disappears, and randomly appears again ><
01:20	<andrejkw>	_antix: well I find it very disorganized and confusing for newcomers
01:21	<makelele>	anyone know hot to handle modules ?
01:21	<amphi>	makelele: woth kid gloves, IMHO
01:21	<amphi>	er, with
01:21	<KenSentMe>	makelele: what modules?
01:22	<soundray>	KenSentMe: install openoffice.org-l10n-nl
01:23	<makelele>	amphi:i am trying to remove the fglrx module (not in /etc/modules) but it still shows up in lsmod
01:23	<KenSentMe>	soundray: is already installed, but is this package not only for menus etc.?
01:23	<makelele>	KenSentme:i am trying to remove the fglrx module (not in /etc/modules) but it still shows up in lsmod
01:24	<pepsi>	asdf
01:24	<bimberi>	KenSentMe: myspell-nl
01:24	<amphi>	makelele: modprobe -r fglrx ?
01:24	<coucho>	amphi: i still have a problem with sendmail: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14419
01:24	<makelele>	amphi: but what happens when i reboot ?
01:24	<amphi>	coucho: why tell me about sendmail?
01:24	<nickrud>	KenSentMe, try installing myspell-nl
01:24	<linuxbomb>	makelele, put it in blacklist
01:25	<coucho>	amphi: cause you helped me with it yesterday
01:25	<amphi>	coucho: with sendmail?
01:25	<makelele>	linuxbomb: how do i do that
01:25	<coucho>	amphi: ah wait, no you didn't, sorry
01:25	<nickrud>	er bimberi you're quick or I'm slow :)
01:25	<linuxbomb>	/etc/hotplug/blacklist
01:25	<coucho>	anyone familiar with sendmail in here?
01:25	<amphi>	coucho: ;) I use postfix
01:25	<soundray>	KenSentMe: you're right. The spellchecker is in myspell-nl
01:26	<coucho>	amphi: yeah i remember now :D
01:26	<Briguy>	how can I edit fstab? it's read only :-(
01:26	<coucho>	Briguy: use sudo
01:26	<amphi>	Briguy: sudo
01:26	<KenSentMe>	soundray: nickrud: bimberi: right, myspell is the one i was looking for. Thank you
01:26	<linuxbomb>	makelele, i normally just mv the module from /lib/modules/
01:27	<CokeNCode>	goodnight, is it possibly to use dialup and adsl at the same time, on the same computer with ubuntu to boost bandwidth ?
01:27	<GatoLoko^>	hi
=== blind|AFK is now known as blind
01:27	<makelele>	linuxbomb: thanks i will try that,although your second option sounds better, this ATI card is causing me grief
01:27	<sflash>	i wanted to share a folder using samba. I have a USB drive that mounted to a folder. For some reason when i share that folder, i cant get it access from a windows computer, any help?
01:27	<coucho>	k i'm getting a little pissed off now, can anyone please help me with sendmail?
01:27	<bimberi>	nickrud: i found my aussie spellchecking yesterday so knew where to look :)
01:27	<MorbidHunger>	what was that one command someone just gave me?
01:27	<CokeNCode>	coucho, what problem are you experiencing ?
01:27	<coucho>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14419
01:27	<coucho>	thnx
01:27	<linuxbomb>	makelele, just do a search in /lib/modules and move it to somewhere and then it wont get loaded
01:28	<Nintendud>	this is weird.
01:28	<MorbidHunger>	how do i change video cards?
01:29	<offby1>	I'm using Dapper on a laptop, and every time I try to hibernate, it merely starts the screen saver.  Am I doing something wrong, or is this a known problem?
01:29	<coucho>	CokeNCode: i use postfix now, but it still seems to want to use sendmail
01:29	<lss>	can someone please help?? need to install my lan card. I've got the correct driver, but don't understand the instructions
01:29	<Nintendud>	I rebooted into 386 kernel, mplayer and xmms worked, uninstalled the 686 kernel, rebooted, and now segmentation fault again
01:29	<Nintendud>	this is really pissing me off >_<
01:29	<makelele>	linuxbomb:thanks ,one more thing ,do you know what the modass dir is all about ?
01:29	<MorbidHunger>	im getting pissed too
01:29	<Nintendud>	I can't win :(
01:29	<coucho>	let's all get pissed :P
01:29	<nickrud>	MorbidHunger, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
01:29	<Knorrie>	looks like everyone is pissing here at the moment
01:29	<Knorrie>	\o/
01:30	<MorbidHunger>	does the xerver has to be running?
01:30	<CokeNCode>	coucho, apt-get install sendmail
01:30	<coucho>	no they're gtting pissed
01:30	<CokeNCode>	the package handler will pretty much do the job for you
01:30	<linuxbomb>	makelele, no idea , but check out modconf utility
01:30	<coucho>	CokeNCode: i don't want to install sendmail, i just got rid of it XD
01:30	<Nintendud>	I seriously don't understand what's happening
01:30	<CokeNCode>	now, to my problem folks ... does anyone know if i can use adsl and dialup at the same time
01:30	<bung>	yes
01:30	<MorbidHunger>	and would it conflict with my onbored video?
01:30	<amphi>	Nintendud: your ram might be marginal?
01:31	<Knorrie>	Nintendud: mplayer has optimized packages for 386, 686 etc... is the right one installed?
01:31	<CokeNCode>	oh, sorry coucho ... right now i'm supposed to have a 512 connection, and i'm connecting at 18 and below ... so i'm a bit distracted ... :/
01:31	<Nintendud>	Knorrie: I compiled it myself, and it worked before.
01:31	<GatoLoko^>	is there a way to see "extra messages" from xorg? i'm having problems (lockups) and the log files don't show nothing
01:31	<Nintendud>	amphi: I have 384 megs of RAM and I'm running XFCE4
01:31	<Briguy>	this is a retarded question but how do you save an opened vim document via console?
01:31	<coucho>	CokeNCode: that's ok, i understand, that's very f'ing frustrating
01:31	<MorbidHunger>	i have 256 sd
01:31	<Nintendud>	everything worked fine before that damned 686 optimized kernel
01:31	<Knorrie>	Nintendud: don't complain @ ubuntu if you compile yourself ;)
01:31	<Nintendud>	Knorrie: xmms doesn't work either
01:32	<Nintendud>	and that wasn't compiled by me
01:32	<MorbidHunger>	a smoking ati rage lt pro onbored video
01:32	<Nintendud>	:P
01:32	<amphi>	Nintendud: I meant is it dodgy - it might be worth trying memtest86
01:32	<coucho>	Briguy: use nano man, much better
01:32	<Nintendud>	amphi: no.
01:32	<Nintendud>	:P
01:32	<Nintendud>	I seriously doubt it's a RAM issue
01:32	<amphi>	Nintendud: me too, just fumbling for a straw ;)
01:32	<Knorrie>	Briguy: ESC :wq
01:32	<Nintendud>	like I said, it worked when I booted into the 386 kernel, but once I uninstalled the 686 kernel and rebooted... segmentation fault again
01:33	<MorbidHunger>	if i reconfigure the x server does it have to be running
01:33	<KenSentMe>	I've added a Samba share to my desktop so i can copy files to and from it. Why don't those network connections work when i use the 'browse'  function on websites in Firefox?
01:33	<amphi>	Nintendud: but that it worked with the 386 kernel while the 686 one was installed, but not when the 686 was uninstalled makes no sense at all
01:33	<Nintendud>	amphi: I know.
01:33	<coucho>	MorbidHunger: probably not, maybe it even needs to not run
01:33	<MorbidHunger>	i ran it while it was running
01:33	<amphi>	Nintendud: so don't muddy the waters ;)
01:34	<MorbidHunger>	but when i put the s3trio in the server bitches at me and wont run
01:34	<MorbidHunger>	is it cuz i have onbored video?
01:34	<Nintendud>	amphi: it might make more sense if I told you that everytime I booted into a different kernel, X would crash on boot and I had to apt-get install and remove nvidia-glx-dev before it would run, and it would continue to work correctly every time I rebooted until I use a different kernel
01:34	<Nintendud>	er, apt-get remove and install*
01:34	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: a server? video? does a server need a video card?
01:34	<MorbidHunger>	dont think so
01:35	<MorbidHunger>	but it wont run
01:35	<MorbidHunger>	whichj puzzles me
01:35	<Nintendud>	(might have to do with "nvidia TLS links", since whenever I install it it updates the "nvidia TLS links"
01:35	<Nintendud>	)
01:35	<DewDude>	any idea why hibernate stopped working in Dapper, it just restarts the system now.
01:35	<Nintendud>	arr, this is weird
01:35	<amphi>	Nintendud: that's part of the fun of proprietary drivers I believe; just pick a kernel and stick to it, is my advice ;)
01:36	<coucho>	what's a s3trio? or is that a really dumb question?
01:36	<Knorrie>	DewDude: hibernate sounds like suspend to disk... and yeah.. network connections will be lost
01:36	<Nintendud>	amphi: well, I still don't know how to fix this. and it's really frustrating me.
01:36	<DewDude>	i'm not talking network connections
01:36	<MorbidHunger>	this video card i found laying around at school
01:36	<DewDude>	i know they get lost
01:36	<Knorrie>	coucho: some video card chip
01:36	<coucho>	lol k
01:36	<amphi>	coucho: an antique ;)
01:36	<coucho>	heheh
01:36	<DewDude>	i'm taking about rather than restoring after syuspend, it just restarts
01:36	<MorbidHunger>	i just cant get it to work with ubuntu
01:36	<MorbidHunger>	it is very old
01:37	<DewDude>	cuz i pretty much stopped all my apps that use networking before i hit hibernate
01:37	<amphi>	Nintendud: pick a kernel, and reinstall all the nvidia packages I'd guess
01:37	<MorbidHunger>	my athlon xp died and im stuck on this peece of shit from hell
01:37	<Nintendud>	hmm
01:37	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: why wont the onboard card work?
01:37	<coucho>	MorbidHunger: i would suggest buying a geforce 4 or something, costs nothing and will work
01:37	<Nintendud>	well, I'm only using the 386 kernel now
01:38	<MorbidHunger>	it does work jsut horrible
01:38	<MorbidHunger>	i dont have an agp slot on this mobo
01:38	<DewDude>	...oh..wait...would suspend to disk be dependant on the kernal image you were using?
01:38	<jadaz87>	hello does anyone know a good APACHE-MYSQL-PHP for ubuntu?
01:38	<nickrud>	MorbidHunger, you need to run the reconfigure command after putting in the new card (sorry if you have, I was awy for a sec)
01:38	<coucho>	MorbidHunger: i've got a mx420 and it works perfectly, and it probably exists as pci card too
01:38	<amphi>	DewDude: this is using swsusp?
01:38	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: if it's meant to be a server... an utp cable is more important than vga :P
01:39	<DewDude>	umm...i'm hitting hibernate from the log off menu
01:39	<DewDude>	it's worked before
01:39	<MorbidHunger>	heh
01:39	<MorbidHunger>	meh
01:39	<coucho>	Knorrie: you dutch btw?
01:39	<Knorrie>	coucho: yes
01:39	<coucho>	ah
01:39	<MorbidHunger>	ubuntu doesnt even detect my onbored audio
01:39	<coucho>	m2
01:39	<MorbidHunger>	i dont have a fan or a heatsink either
01:39	<DewDude>	however, when i was using the wifi earlier, i was using my 386  kernal rather than the 686 because my wifi tends to lock the 686 kernel up
01:39	<Knorrie>	coucho: i saw you using paste.ubuntunl ;p
01:39	<coucho>	XD
01:39	<amphi>	DewDude: it might be that you need to boot with restore=/dev/foo where /dev/foo is your swap partition, for it to work
01:39	<Evanescent>	um hello
01:40	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: hi
01:40	<MorbidHunger>	its amazing this thing works
01:40	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: lol
01:40	<MorbidHunger>	i should send ug uys pics later
01:40	<DewDude>	heh, well, if it's using disk swap, it's probablty already overwritten the session
01:40	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: lol @ onbored audio
01:40	<MorbidHunger>	yeah
01:40	<Knorrie>	:D
01:40	<Evanescent>	this is where i make myself look really stupid
01:40	<MorbidHunger>	ill see if i can get a sound card tomroww
01:40	<amphi>	DewDude: er, s/restore/resume
01:40	<DewDude>	MorbidHunger, that's a shame because ubuntu worked on all my hardware
01:40	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: you're not stupid
01:40	<coucho>	MorbidHunger: you do that
01:40	<DewDude>	only thing i can't get running is 3d on my laptop
01:40	<MorbidHunger>	its cuz im on a compaq and my karma sucks
01:40	<amphi>	DewDude: and yes, a normal boot will obliterate the session
01:41	<Knorrie>	!MorbidHunger++
01:41	<Evanescent>	can someone tell me how to install ubuntu as a dual boot with 2kpro?
01:41	<dominion>	Morbid fact: On June 29, 1955, the reign of King Haakon VII, who had ruled Norway from the time of its independence in 1905, effectively came to an end when the beloved monarch fell in the royal bathtub at his palace in Oslo. The elderly king lingered on for over two years before succumbing on Setpember 21, 1957, to complications resulting from his fall.
01:41	<DewDude>	amphi: alrighty then, no real big loss
01:41	<MorbidHunger>	this is horrible guys
01:41	<DewDude>	it had worked before..i'll ahve to play with it a bit
01:41	<Nintendud>	HOLY CRAP
01:41	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: first install 2k, then install ubuntu
01:41	<Nintendud>	amphi: reinstalling nvidia stuff and everything worked
01:41	<amphi>	dominion: whiskey tango foxtrot?
01:41	<Nintendud>	I don't even have to reboot
01:41	<DewDude>	my laptop lacks battery, so, if i take it anywhere, i like to sysuspend to disk so i don't have to wait for the boot process
01:41	<leojstewart>	Does anybody else have problems with Gmail-Notify?
01:42	<amphi>	DewDude: yeah, I use swsusp a lot
01:42	<cocox>	wish application could you recommend me for partitioning my disk????
01:42	<Nintendud>	thank you amphi. makes me wonder if I could reinstall the 686 kernel and reinstall nvidia things to get it to work. ;p but I am not doing that today
01:42	<MorbidHunger>	ok but will the s3trio conflict with the onbored video?
01:42	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: the ubuntu installer will overwrite the boot record with a boot-loader, and present w2k and ubuntu choice
01:42	<Nintendud>	thanks for the help and patience
01:42	<amphi>	DewDude: no need to reboot, evar ;)
01:42	<coucho>	cocox: partition magic
01:42	<rab>	whats the command to display system information
01:42	<cocox>	coucho, for linux ?
01:42	<amphi>	coucho: no
01:42	<coucho>	XD
01:42	<coucho>	just kidding
01:42	<coucho>	sry
01:42	<DewDude>	amphi: yeah, i think my problem was i didn't specify the kernel i suspended with, because i think my ndiswrapper conflicts with 686
01:43	<Khoacalacan>	Can anyone help me please? I have this error message after.....

01:43	<cocox>	coucho, ( WinROFLING face... )
01:43	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: whenever 'repairing' w2k or reinstalling w2k, the windows installer breaks your system
01:43	<Evanescent>	Knorrie: yeah i've already got 2kpro installed i'm just not sure how to go about installing ubuntu. i downloaded the iso, opened it with undisker and burnt the files to a data disc but it's not bootable
01:43	<MorbidHunger>	Khoacalacan. thats the same shit i got
01:43	<DewDude>	heh
01:43	<Khoacalacan>	Dam anyone know how to fix it???
01:43	<DewDude>	hey, i've like, installed linux, then installed XP, then fixed dual boot
01:43	<DewDude>	man, i had some fun with the MBR that day
01:43	<MorbidHunger>	install xp than linux
01:43	<amphi>	DewDude: yeah, it's not rocket surgery ;)
01:44	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: when you burn the iso to a cdrom it should be bootable
01:44	<cocox>	Khoacalacan, http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=174537 read this at the end
01:44	<Khoacalacan>	Ok thank you
01:44	<DewDude>	amphi, dual-booting or my suspend issue
01:44	<cocox>	Khoacalacan, there is the solution
01:44	<coucho>	DewDude: that's not very wise
01:44	<amphi>	DewDude: dual booting
01:44	<MorbidHunger>	i should read that roo
01:44	<MorbidHunger>	too*
01:44	<Khoacalacan>	Thank you cocox
01:44	<DewDude>	coucho: i know. I learned my lesson when after resoring my MBR, my XP partition was gone.
01:44	<cocox>	Khoacalacan np :)
01:44	<coucho>	DewDude: ouch XD
01:44	<DewDude>	i was able to get that back by telling CFDisk to repartition
01:44	<MorbidHunger>	hooray for crappy hardware!!
01:44	<DewDude>	coucho: no, cfdisk fixed it in about 2 seconds
01:45	<DewDude>	it's been dual-booting ever since
01:45	<amphi>	DewDude: I imagine very Bad Things(TM) will happen if you boot a different kernel than you suspended with and manage to get the session to restore
01:45	<coucho>	DewDude: wow
01:45	<DewDude>	amphi, yeah, i totally forgot i had done that.
01:45	<Evanescent>	Knorrie: even after opening the iso file first?
01:45	<coucho>	DewDude: didn't think that was possible
01:45	<DewDude>	cuz i was about ready to throw this out a window earlier
01:45	<DewDude>	coucho: sure it is.
01:45	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: you dont need to open an iso, just burn it byte-by-byte to a cdrom
01:46	<DewDude>	i had a drive partition completely disappear once
01:46	<Khoacalacan>	Cocox: Is it near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
01:46	<coucho>	DewDude: doesn't the xp install completely overwrite the mbr?
01:46	<vars>	hey i am making a multimedia cd for windows and i want to make an icon for the launcher to launch    does anyone know how to do this?
01:46	<cocox>	amphi, what is the difference between qparted, cfdisk or gparted ??? can anybody please tell me wish one is the best ??
01:46	<iguananed>	hello all, just wondering if there is a way to test surround sound in ubuntu?
01:46	<DewDude>	coucho: yes, it does
01:46	<DewDude>	but..if you partition your drives out
01:46	<coucho>	DewDude: then what?
01:46	<DewDude>	back up the MBR, install windows, then restore the MBR, that CAN work
01:46	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: you're burning in windows?
01:46	<DewDude>	provided you don't backup before setting your partitions
01:46	<Evanescent>	Knorrie: ok i'll try it but if it desn't work i'll be back to haunt you...
01:47	<Evanescent>	yes
01:47	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: using what tool?
01:47	<amphi>	cocox: depends for what - one of the parteds if you need to resize some existing partition, otherwise cfdisk for just normally partitioning a disk; there's fdisk and sfdisk as well, but cfdisk is the simplest to use
01:47	<Evanescent>	nero
01:47	<coucho>	DewDude: so first install linux, backup mbr, install xp, replace mbr?
01:47	<DewDude>	coucho: that's one way of doing it IF you want to install linux before windows
01:47	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: nero should allow you to just 'burn cd image'
01:47	<DewDude>	but make sure you have EVERYTHING partitioned out
01:47	<amphi>	coucho: or just reinstall grub
01:47	<DewDude>	yeah
01:47	<cocox>	amphi, all those allow me to change mi partiotion size without erase my data ??
01:47	<coucho>	DewDude: yeah i just installed xp first, seemed easier XD
01:48	<DewDude>	you'll need a live or bootcd either way
01:48	<Knorrie>	Evanescent: i did that some long time ago when i had windows installed :P
01:48	<Evanescent>	yeah it's being awkward
01:48	<Khoacalacan>	Cocox: Is solution near the bottom of the topic or the whole thing?
01:48	<Falstius>	my nfs mount stopped working.  I didn't change anything, but now I get the message "mount: box:/media/jakarta failed, reason given by server: Permission denied" .. there's nothing in the server or client /var/log/messages and the exports allows 192.168.* ... any suggestions of where I could look now?
01:48	<MorbidHunger>	im so screwed
01:48	<cocox>	Khoacalacan, lol just the last post
01:48	<Evanescent>	ok i'll try it anyway, thanks for now
01:48	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: get some decent hardware
01:48	<Khoacalacan>	oh I was reading the whole thing XD
01:48	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: sorry :P
01:48	<amphi>	coucho: the parteds are for that as I said; I've succesfully resized an ntfs partition once for someone with a parted; better to back up before messing with partitions generally, IMHO
01:48	<DewDude>	Falstius, did you check your /etc/fstab?
01:48	<MorbidHunger>	i need to buy a mobo
01:49	<MorbidHunger>	i dont have 60 bucks
01:49	<cocox>	Khoacalacan, excuse me the one before the last post
01:49	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: student life is hard
01:49	<MorbidHunger>	yeah
01:49	<DewDude>	or...wait..is the NFTS drive in your local machine or are you doing it over LAN using Samba?
01:49	<MorbidHunger>	espically when im busy fixing everyone else stuff
01:49	<MorbidHunger>	and than they bitch about the free work i did
01:49	<Khoacalacan>	Arghhhh
01:49	<Falstius>	DewDude: I can't mount it from the command line either ...
01:49	<MorbidHunger>	meh sorry for the rant
01:50	<coucho>	MorbidHunger: just buy asrock or something, that oughtta be less than 60 bucks
01:50	<MorbidHunger>	ttyl guys
01:50	<coucho>	later
01:50	<MorbidHunger>	mom finished dinner
01:50	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: have fun cu later
01:50	<MorbidHunger>	yeah im sure i cna buy one for less
01:50	<MorbidHunger>	but not one id be happy with

01:50	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: so DONT COMPLAIN :DDD
01:51	<MorbidHunger>	im not bitched about the cpu
01:51	<Knorrie>	ghehehe
01:51	<Falstius>	DewDude: a simple mount "box:/media /media" gives me that error.  This is NFS, not NTFS.
01:51	<MorbidHunger>	just the video
01:51	<Knorrie>	MorbidHunger: serial console rocks
01:51	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: it can't do 80x25 console?
01:51	<DewDude>	oh, nfs
01:51	<DewDude>	i'm dyslexic
01:51	<coucho>	CPU: AMD Athlon 64 3500+
01:51	<Falstius>	no worries.
01:51	<coucho>	ow wait, wrong one
01:51	<DewDude>	doesn't help when trying to learn linux
01:52	<DewDude>	umm...i don't really know...everytime i've done anything with NFS, i've had to use a howto
01:52	<Old>	where do you put .sh files?
01:52	<DewDude>	like, i got samba commands memorized
01:52	<Old>	Anyone know where to put my .sh files?
01:52	<Falstius>	ahh, I'm the opposite.  Normally I can just do nfs, but I have to look up anything to do with samba.
01:52	<vars>	hey i ahve a cd-wr what should my fstab permissions be?
01:52	<Knorrie>	Old: ~/bin

02:04	<tommy_>	i d like to know if someone knows a way to revert a "rm" command ?
02:04	<Old>	how do you mean ?
02:04	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 - sorry /etc/X11/XF86config
02:04	<coucho>	Knorrie: is there some sort of xthingy viewer for windows?
02:04	<tommy_>	is there a kind of trash when we use rm ?

02:08	<amphi>	lufis: I commend -C to your attention ;)
02:08	<Old>	amphi, any ideas why i get that error? I cant seem to understand it
02:08	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -  ok, there is a ppc channel #ubuntu-ppc (I think)
02:09	<darwin188>	okey
02:09	<lufis>	Ampi: alright, thank you
02:09	<Madpilot>	jadaz87, you running Breezy or Dapper?
02:09	<darwin188>	but it shouldnt be different
02:09	<lufis>	amphi&
02:09	<darwin188>	i think
02:09	<jadaz87>	Madpilot: dapper
02:09	<darwin188>	believe
02:09	<Madpilot>	jadaz87, I read somewhere that webmin has been dropped completely from Dapper
02:09	<jadaz87>	NOO!!! :-(
02:09	<jadaz87>	Madpilot: why?
02:09	<amphi>	Old: the error is clear - no script called stop.sh in CWD
02:09	<jadaz87>	Madpilot: can i install the one from breezy?
02:10	<Zizou>	Hi, does any body knows how to change the totem video output? i install xgl, the videos are really slow, I think I have to change it to gl or gl2...
02:10	<Old>	CWD?
02:10	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -  but try this command befor you go there >	'cat /etc/X11/FX86' but hit tab before enter and let it auto compleate
02:10	<amphi>	Old: current working directory
02:10	<Madpilot>	ruchbah_, there is no channel #ubuntu-ppc
02:10	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -  what do you get?
02:10	<Madpilot>	jadaz87, no idea, on either of your questions
02:10	<leojstewart>	Why is it that with the 'Weather Report' that when I click Update, it seems to update, but the 'Last Update' says a time of twenty or so minutes ago?
02:10	<Old>	hmpfh
02:10	<amphi>	Old: because the cd command failed
02:10	<amphi>	from your paste above
02:10	<leojstewart>	Does anyone know?
02:11	<Madpilot>	leojstewart, the weather only updates once an hour or so - it's from the US Weather Service website
02:11	<shinu>	anyone could tell me how to force framebuffer to use a i810 driver instead of the vesa one?
02:11	<ruchbah_>	Madpilot - any where else he should check for ppc specific stuff?
02:11	<leojstewart>	Oh, I thought it was from Weather.com
02:11	<leojstewart>	thanks, Madpilot
02:11	<Old>	gonna try something else, one sec
02:12	<Madpilot>	ruchbah_, no - but there are Ubuntu_PPC users here...
02:12	<ruchbah_>	ok
02:12	<leojstewart>	is there any way to make it update from a different website which updates more fequently?
02:12	<amphi>	shinu: console fb?
02:12	<nelisa>	Madpilot, I;m trying to plug my ipaq
02:12	<Madpilot>	leojstewart, it's an open source app, so probably ;)
02:12	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- you still out there?
02:12	<nelisa>	Madpilot, witout any luck
02:12	<darwin188>	yes
02:12	<darwin188>	whats up?
02:13	<shinu>	amphi: yes
02:13	<darwin188>	ruchbah_: i am still here
02:13	<leojstewart>	Madpilot: i'm a linux-newbie... so if it's hard, it's probably not worth it :)

02:13	<Madpilot>	leojstewart, heh
02:13	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- did you catch that that there is no ppc specific channel?  Did you try the FX86 thing?
02:13	<nelisa>	whero do I get synce??
02:13	<P3L|C4N0>	greetings
02:13	<amphi>	shinu: perhaps boot with 'video=i810fb', but you might need more than that - is that one of those 'shared memory' cards?

02:15	<shinu>	thanks amphi
02:15	<amphi>	shinu: reserve ram for it or summat
02:15	<darwin188>	same
02:15	<Zizou>	keithsr: can you see the ubuntu server in the win machine?
02:15	<nelisa>	guys why the synce packages are not found??
02:15	<keithsr>	yes

02:15	<darwin188>	wait
02:15	<darwin188>	yeah it
02:15	<darwin188>	worked

02:16	<sflash>	when you download a application from sinaptic , where does it go?
02:16	<Zizou>	keithsr: what does it says when you try to access?
02:16	<darwin188>	ruchbah_: it worked
02:16	<amphi>	sflash: dpkg -L package-name will show what files a package installed
02:16	<darwin188>	then what?
02:16	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- do you have something that starts with FX86?
02:16	<shinu>	:)
02:16	<keithsr>	Zizou: it wats a user and password
02:16	<Madpilot>	sflash, that depends what it is
02:16	<darwin188>	no
02:16	<bimberi>	sflash: the deb files go in /var/cache/apt/archoves, but packages put files in various locations
02:16	<leojstewart>	How can I access my startup programs... and how can I add a program to startup with the system?
02:16	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- just a sec
02:17	<Zizou>	keithsr: ok... you have to use smbpasswd "user"
02:17	<darwin188>	ok
02:17	<spanglesontoast>	does anyone know how to get files within a directory using wget
02:17	<Zizou>	keithsr: user is an actual user of the ubuntu server...
02:17	<spanglesontoast>	?
02:17	<Khoacalacan>	I have two(2) hard drives and it only shows one hard drive on my computer, How do I make the second one show?

02:17	<bimberi>	leojstewart: System ->	Preferences ->	Sessions, Startup Programs
02:17	<sflash>	do i have to add it manually?
02:17	<leojstewart>	bimberl: Thanks :)
02:17	<keithsr>	i have tried that but it is not working
02:18	<bimberi>	leojstewart: np :)
02:18	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- how about xorg.conf?
02:18	<Zizou>	keithsr: how is that? is the only way
02:18	<bimberi>	sflash: probably, some packages don't create menu entries :|  right-click on the Applications Menu and select Edit Menus
02:18	<unperson>	What sort of "extention" does a printer driver file usually have?
02:18	<adrums20>	I am having issues with logging in as ROOT - I have tried the su passwd root and still no go.. I just installed Ubuntu yesterday
02:19	<amy_>	hey
02:19	<Zizou>	keithsr: if you have an user "zizou" in the ubuntu server
02:19	<unperson>	adrums20: You mean sudo passwd root, right?
02:19	<Zizou>	keithsr: you do smbpasswd zizou
02:19	<adrums20>	yes
02:19	<bimberi>	keithsr: is this samba?  if so samba has its own password list - "sudo smbpasswd -a username"
02:20	<unperson>	adrums20: What happened when you tried that?
02:20	<Zizou>	keithsr: then when youre accesing the ubuntu server you type the user zizou and the password you asinght it..
02:20	<adrums20>	let me try bud
02:21	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- breaker breaker
02:21	<darwin188>	heh?
02:21	<darwin188>	i am still here
02:21	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- how about /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
02:21	<Zizou>	keithsr: try with the same password that is in the linux acount
02:21	<darwin188>	yes
02:21	<darwin188>	i have it
02:21	<keithsr>	yes samba...ihave done that
02:22	<unperson>	Any extensions other than .ppd for printer driver files?  Anyone?
02:22	<darwin188>	rachbah_ : still holding
02:22	<adrums20>	it asks for the password and then I type it in. and back to the prompt it goes
02:22	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- can you post it on http://paste-ubuntu.nl.org?
02:22	<darwin188>	what shhould i post?
02:22	<darwin188>	the problem is that i am on my laptop and i am installing linux on another computer
02:23	<adrums20>	lat2bt
02:23	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- ok, ok, let me see ....
02:23	<unperson>	adrums20: So it doesn't say "Password updated succesfully"?
02:23	<adrums20>	nope
02:24	<darwin188>	someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know what to do there
02:24	<deoryp>	what do i install to get j++ support?
02:24	<unperson>	adrums20: Odd.
02:24	<Helldragon>	hi
02:24	<Helldragon>	amphi you still there ^
02:24	<adrums20>	thats what I thought.  I have been reading all day on the posts and nothing works after a fresh install
02:24	<keithsr>	when using smbpasswd it gives all options when  i use the options it says it had to abort
02:25	<Helldragon>	grub works, but i cant boot on linux, only windows, when i try to boot on any linux kernel it says error 17 : sda8 not mounted
02:25	<unperson>	adrums20: I'm not quite sure what that means.  You could do "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow"
02:25	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- is the linux box on line then?
02:25	<Helldragon>	mount /dev/sda8 doesnt work
02:25	<unperson>	adrums20: The second field is a crypted password.
02:25	<darwin188>	no its offline
02:25	<Helldragon>	anyone can help me
02:25	<darwin188>	linux is recently installed and unconfigured to do anything
02:25	<deoryp>	anyone have any hint for me ? =- what do i install to get j++
02:25	<unperson>	adrums20: It should be a bunch of jibberish (don't post it here), but it might be a "*".
02:26	<unperson>	adrums20: A "*" indicates no password set.
02:26	<darwin188>	but i get to errors
02:26	<deoryp>	Helldragon i can try
02:26	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- what happens when you try that dpkg command?
02:26	<amphi>	Helldragon: because sda8 is your swap partition, IIRC from your fdisk -l output - what is the kernel command line in grub?
02:26	<adrums20>	once I do that command, it goes back to the prompt
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off
02:26	<darwin188>	i get into a blue screen
02:26	<darwin188>	with options
02:26	<darwin188>	for selecting drivers, resolutions, keyboards etc
02:26	<Helldragon>	i dont understand amphi
=== sub|off is now known as sub|at|alpopel
02:26	<darwin188>	but everythging seems to be selected just fine
02:27	<darwin188>	when i do startx
02:27	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- ok, that's good.  Get there
02:27	<unperson>	adrums20: Wait, you did "sudo grep 'root' /etc/shadow" and got no output?
02:27	<darwin188>	i get error of Unable to find a vlaid framebuffer device
02:27	<darwin188>	okey
02:27	<amphi>	Helldragon: linux is trying to mount the wrong partition as / AFAICS
02:27	<adrums20>	thats correct - nothing
02:27	<Helldragon>	thats weird
02:27	<Helldragon>	how can i fix that
02:27	<lufis>	For those of you who know your way around linux, how long did it take for you to get down the basics?
02:27	<Helldragon>	 fdisk -l output says nothing
02:28	<adrums20>	im using bash
02:28	<unperson>	adrums20: Ok...  Well, do "sudo less /etc/shadow"
02:28	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- do you have an option in there to not look for a framebuffer dev?
02:28	<_gus_>	where do i setup enviroment variables ?
02:28	<adrums20>	nothing goes back to the prompt again
02:28	<unperson>	That should allow you to view the contents of the /etc/shadow file (which contains your crypted passwords).
02:28	<darwin188>	someone told me to use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but i dont know i guess
02:28	<darwin188>	wait i guess
02:28	<amphi>	Helldragon: in the grub menu, choose linux, hit e, go to the kernel line, and if it says root=/dev/sda8 try changing it to /dev/sda7
02:28	<Helldragon>	ok
02:28	<unperson>	adrums20: Hmm...something is very, very messed up there.
02:28	<Helldragon>	ill try brb
02:28	<adrums20>	think a reinstall?
02:29	<darwin188>	use kernel framebuffer device interfcace
02:29	<darwin188>	yes or no?
02:29	<unperson>	adrums20: Well...that's probably premature.
02:29	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- no
02:29	<wims>	breezy is v5.10, right?
02:29	<adrums20>	im still a newbie at this..and I just installed it last night
02:29	<amphi>	Helldragon: then you hit esc and b to boot IIRC - it's been a while
02:29	<darwin188>	autodetect keyboard
02:29	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- yeap
02:29	<amphi>	Helldragon: er, enter and b
02:30	<darwin188>	i skipped all the keyboard stuff
02:30	<scabootssca>	hey ubuntu started printing error messages any idea what they are? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14343
02:30	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- fine
02:30	<PORDO>	anyone else unable to use google search?
02:30	<unperson>	adrums20: Hmm...I have to go.  Hopefully someone more knowledgable than me can help.  What you're saying should NOT result from a normal install, though, so either you're doing something simple wrong (that I'm just missing) or something was VERY messed up with your install.
02:30	<darwin188>	now i am on configuring xserver-xorg..select the x.org server modules that should be loaded by default
02:30	<wims>	PORDO, works for me
02:30	<amphi>	PORDO: google works from here
02:30	<adrums20>	alrighty thanks bud
02:31	<unperson>	adrums20: Good luck.  Sorry to run.
02:31	<adrums20>	anyone know how to login as root -
02:31	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- ok what kind of hardware do you have and what are the choices?  I usually just make a reasonable guess
02:31	<PORDO>	the first one i bought, yesterday, was a dud..so i took it back today and forgot to return one little piece, still in my pocket.  now i have two stylii.
02:31	<slackern>	adrums20: i usually just do 'sudo -i'
02:32	<wims>	adrums20,  can't you just use sudo -s from your normal user instead of logging in with root ?
02:32	<darwin188>	the video card is an ati radeon 16 megas
02:32	<adrums20>	for some reason after a fresh install, I cant

02:33	<adrums20>	nothing happends

02:44	<HellDragon>	it breaks because of everything
02:44	<darwin188>	oh okey
02:44	<darwin188>	i think i already did
02:44	<HellDragon>	i unplug my printer, poof not working
02:44	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- try running the dpkg command that you just ran.
02:44	<HellDragon>	etc..
02:44	<HellDragon>	so grub is poop
02:45	<darwin188>	wait a sec
02:45	<HellDragon>	!!!!!!!!!!!!!
02:45	<ubotu>	HellDragon: No idea, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
02:45	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- It was asking if you wanted to use the kernnel's framebuffer device
02:45	<HellDragon>	panic
02:45	<HellDragon>	!kernel panic
02:45	<ubotu>	Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, HellDragon
02:45	<darwin188>	yes it asked tath
02:45	<jhenn>	Is ubuntu generally good at detecting video cards?  My video card was "detected" but its updating slowly. Any ideas guys?
02:45	<kuja>	Taru: You actually found your way to IRC on your own?
02:46	<HellDragon>	lol
02:46	<HellDragon>	amphi ill test another time brb
02:46	<Taru>	Kuja: Yes, it is quite easy actually.
02:46	<Old>	amphi, can you understand this?: Output from command .. ./settings.conf: line 2: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 10: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 29: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 34: : command not found ./settings.conf: line 36: : command not found usage ./start.sh start|stop|restart|status|watch|clean
02:46	<amphi>	HellDragon: grub has never broken for me, so perhaos it's not grub...
02:46	<darwin188>	ruchbah - i am already at the configuration screens
02:46	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- I don't know.  I'm a bit lost here.  I think try a bit of trial and error.
02:46	<darwin188>	ok
02:47	<darwin188>	but you think this is the way to solve the problem?
02:47	<amphi>	Old: whatever commands are being invoked from those lines are not found ;)
02:47	<darwin188>	or is there another possible cause of the problem
02:47	<cocox>	if i already install amule but i want to uninstall it, how can i know what is the name of the package for make an dpkg -r ?????
02:47	<Old>	oh ...grrr
02:47	<Taru>	Kuja: 42% -_-
02:47	<kuja>	Taru: So you... got into GNOME?
02:47	<kuja>	Taru: Or are you on your brother's computer right now?
02:48	<Taru>	Kuja: Not yet ; ;
02:48	<amphi>	cocox: apt-get remove [--purge]  amule ?
02:48	<ruchbah_>	darwin188 -- I've never messed with a framebuffer problem.  I know the regular X set up fairly well, but we're a bit out of my relm
02:48	<Taru>	Kuja: Still on my brother's computer.
02:48	<jhenn>	Is ubuntu generally good at detecting video cards?  My video card was "detected" but its updating slowly. Any ideas guys?
02:48	<darwin188>	okey then
02:48	<darwin188>	thanks for your time
02:48	<amphi>	jhenn: what card is it?
02:48	<ruchbah_>	your welcome
02:49	<Old>	amphi, http://www.ew-clan.co.uk/tuts/images/webtut2.jpg
02:49	<Old>	thats how it looks atm
02:49	<Old>	the settings.conf / start.sh are in .bin
02:49	<sflash>	in my ubuntu i installed
02:49	<Taru>	Kuja: I have to go back and forth, it's getting really lame.
02:49	<sflash>	in cspan i have to use make
02:49	<amphi>	Old: how what looks? I'm on dialup...
02:49	<sflash>	and there is no make in the bin directory
02:49	<Old>	Look at the picture if you can, thats how the setup looks
02:49	<amphi>	sflash: install build-esential perhaps
02:49	<sflash>	is this correct
02:49	<kuja>	Taru: Well... that's your fault :P
02:49	<sflash>	ok
02:49	<amphi>	Old: setup of what?
02:49	<Taru>	Kuja: 54% :/
02:50	<Old>	the webmin
02:50	<Taru>	Kuja: No :P
02:50	<Old>	amphi, does this command work on ubuntu?: sh start.sh start
02:50	<amphi>	Old: er, I'm not on ubuntu atm ;)
02:50	<HellDragon>	amphi guess what
02:50	<Old>	well, does "sh start.sh start" work for debian/ubuntu? Does it even excist?
02:50	<jhenn>	amphi: i don't know what card it is?  will lspci tell me?
02:51	<HellDragon>	i had to change the first line :O from hd(0,7) to hd(0,6)
02:51	<HellDragon>	and it worked
02:51	<Old>	I think there's where the problem is
02:51	<HellDragon>	didnt touch the root line
02:51	<terry>	hello I need help for install emacs....??
02:51	<MorbidHunger>	shiity ass dinner
02:51	<terry>	in my ubuntu
02:51	<amphi>	Old: you don't need the initial sh if the script is executable
02:51	<cocox>	amphi, apt-get remove amule , and apt-get --purge amule doesnt works!!
02:51	<Old>	amphi, what do you mean? what should i write there?
02:51	<Old>	./start.sh start ?
02:51	<Old>	or?
02:52	<sflash>	build-essential is not found
02:52	<amphi>	HellDragon: that'd help, as (hd0,7) is your swap partition according to fdisk
02:52	<thrice`>	terry, sudo apt-get install emacs ?
02:52	<amphi>	cocox: how did you install it?
02:53	<amphi>	cocox: man apt-get might be worth looking at too, BTW
02:53	<amphi>	HellDragon: anyway, you have it working
02:53	<HellDragon>	 i got a problem with XMMS it play my song really slow
02:53	<HellDragon>	wtf
02:53	<HellDragon>	3 mins song takes 10 mins to play
02:54	<terry>	thrice I was try this comand but isn't work
02:54	<thrice`>	what does it say
02:55	<cocox>	amphi, i installed it using apt-get install amule
02:55	<Old>	Hahaha
02:55	<Old>	I tried to do a ./start.sh in putty, it's graphical
02:55	<Old>	errr
02:55	<Old>	or something like that, text based atleast, asking questions and other stuff.
02:55	<amphi>	cocox: so apt-get remove it
02:55	<cocox>	amphi, im looking at the man dpkg an i know how to uninstall but i must have the name of the package
02:55	<amphi>	cocox: you know the name of the package - it doesn't change after you install it
02:56	<cocox>	Leyendo lista de paquetes... Hecho
02:56	<cocox>	Creando rbol de dependencias... Hecho
02:56	<cocox>	El paquete amule no esta instalado, no se eliminar
02:56	<cocox>	0 actualizados, 0 se instalarn, 0 para eliminar y 0 no actualizados.
02:56	<cocox>	amphi, i can't remember what is the name of the package...
02:56	<amphi>	cocox: so it's no longer installed
02:56	<cr1mson>	Where can I get dependancies like glib, sh-utils, file-utils, gawk, textutils and bin/sh?
02:56	<AngryElf>	so, there's this nifty litlte "digital out" 8mm plug on my Audigy2 card, i assume that means i can somehow connect it to my home theatre box -- is it supported by linux?
02:56	<amphi>	cocox: apt-cache search amule
02:56	<cr1mson>	glibc
02:57	<cocox>	amphi but i still have a lot of files about amule.... and i dont know how can i uninstall them
02:57	<Dr_Willis>	AngryElf,  the digital out can work :P
02:57	<Dr_Willis>	i use it onmy Audigy2 all the time
02:57	<Dr_Willis>	may need to twiddle with the sliders/mixer controls.
02:58	<AngryElf>	into a home theatre....so you can get 5.1 from a DVD?
02:58	<Old>	how do i create a screen?
02:58	<Old>	ex, called speedlink ?
02:58	<AngryElf>	xine supports it i assume
02:58	<terry>	cocox porque con el comado apt-get install emacs no lo puedo installar....
02:58	<cr1mson>	!glibc
02:58	<ubotu>	I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, cr1mson
02:58	<thrice`>	terry, we need an error to help you
02:58	<thrice`>	!es
02:59	<ubotu>	Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
02:59	<Dr_Willis>	Old,  care to rephrase that.
02:59	<sflash>	do you think if i uninstall cpan and reinstall it will have a make file?
02:59	<man_exec>	hi all
02:59	<Old>	I need to create a 'screen' called speedlink, what is it? screen -R speedlink ?
02:59	<HellDragon>	oh i forgot: thank you very much for helping me amphi
03:00	<AngryElf>	Dr_Willis, what kind of wire/connection/converter do you use....and into what input on your stereo?
03:00	<man_exec>	I'm looking for help with agpgart and a radeon 9600
03:00	<cocox>	terry, que mensaje te sale ?
03:00	<HellDragon>	omg........ with every music player my songs are slow
03:00	<HellDragon>	wtf
03:00	<HellDragon>	anyone can help me ?
03:00	<jhenn>	256AV]  (rev 12)
03:00	<vars>	/dev/sda1
03:00	<amphi>	HellDragon: yw - it's strange that grub was so misguided - did you move partitions around or something?
03:00	<vars>	wha tis that?
03:00	<Old>	Dr_Willis, I need to create a 'screen' called speedlink, what is it? screen -R speedlink ?
03:00	<HellDragon>	amphi: i just resized a partition with the evil partition magic
03:01	<terry>	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
03:01	<terry>	E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
03:01	<thrice`>	terry, ok, are you using apt-get or synaptic or anything else?
03:01	<HellDragon>	aahhhhh i want my normal sound back
03:01	<HellDragon>	;(
03:01	<Dr_Willis>	Old,  using screen you can rename the screen sessions. check the screen tutorials.. or you can always edit your .screenrc file and have it create one every time
03:02	<terry>	now I use both
03:02	<HellDragon>	its weird
03:02	<HellDragon>	damn it
03:02	<Old>	Dr_Willis, i want to create a new one called speedlink? I get a error when starting my game-server with webadmin, the error is:Output from command .. No screen session found.
03:02	<cocox>	terry, apt-cache search emacs | grep emacs
03:02	<Old>	I guess I have to start a screen called speedlink
03:02	<terry>	but didn't work
03:02	<terry>	a ok
03:02	<thrice`>	terry, you can only use one at a time
03:02	<Dr_Willis>	Old,  you sure its not saying you need to have screen running?
03:03	<Old>	Exactly, I think i need a screen running, but how do i run one ?
03:03	<Dr_Willis>	Old,  it MAY be refering to the 'screen' command.
03:04	<amphi>	HellDragon: oh, yes, I'd forgotten that you'd sinned ;)
03:04	<nickpresta>	I need help with my mouse. It sometimes randomly moves around my screen, locks the y-axis and only moves along the x-axis and will randomly click while it moves. Any help?
03:04	<Dr_Willis>	or it may be using 'screen session in' a rather vague way.
03:04	<HellDragon>	im getting crazy
03:04	<HellDragon>	damn sound
03:04	<Taru>	Kuja: All finished, now what?
03:04	<HellDragon>	everything plays at 0.5 speed
03:04	<Taru>	Kuja: Reboot?
03:04	<HellDragon>	damnit
03:05	<amphi>	HellDragon: it's trying to calm you down ;)
03:05	<HellDragon>	what happened to my sound
03:05	<HellDragon>	even the sound in my games is slow
03:05	<HellDragon>	what happened
03:05	<kuja>	Taru: No -- sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:05	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay
03:06	<Old>	Dr_Willis, yes? that's what im talking about i guess?
03:06	<NytShade>	I've got a question about choosing which build of Ubuntu to install. I've got a Athlon 64 processor, but am I correct in understanding Automatix will not work with that build?
03:06	<Dr_Willis>	Old,  run 'screen' then in a terminal - i guess
03:06	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay it works this time.
03:06	<terry>	how can I open the emacs....???
03:06	<HellDragon>	what happened to my sound !!! nooooooooooooo
03:07	<amphi>	Old: it wants you to start a command in screen with a particular session name?
03:07	<Old>	exactly
03:07	<kuja>	Taru: Find where it says `Identifier "Generic Video Card"'
03:07	<amphi>	Old: screen -S foo will do that
03:07	<Dr_Willis>	amphi,  somthing seems - odd about that. do ya think?
03:07	<kuja>	Taru: And below that line should be a Driver "nv", which you should replace the "nv" with "nvidia" (unless it's already done)
03:08	<nickpresta>	Any mouse help?
03:08	<Old>	amphi, what's dmS ?
03:08	<Old>	-dmS
03:08	<Old>	!pastebin
03:08	<amphi>	Dr_Willis: the whole thing seems odd
03:08	<ubotu>	from memory, pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
03:08	<amphi>	Old: args to screen - man screen for more ;)
03:09	<amphi>	Old: -d means run detached from a tty
03:09	<ruchbah>	nickpresta -- how newbie are you?
03:09	<Taru>	Kuja: It's "nv".
03:09	<Old>	k
03:09	<kuja>	Taru: Change it to "nvidia"
03:09	<Old>	how to kill all procces including "speedlink" init ?
03:09	<kuja>	Taru: Then hit Control+O and Enter
03:09	<nickpresta>	I'm familiar with *nix like systems but I haven't had this problem before or the inner workins of X so I don't know how to fix it/diagnose it.
03:09	<ruchbah>	nickpresta -- do you know how to look at /etc/X11/Xorg.conf ?
03:09	<nickpresta>	yeah
03:09	<nickpresta>	It looks fine to me
03:09	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay, done.
03:10	<kuja>	Taru: Afterwards, exit nano (Ctrl+X) then type: 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start', then you should be at the login screen. At which point you type your username and password.
03:10	<ruchbah>	nickpresta -- take a look see what your mouse driver is listed at there
03:10	<Old>	amphi, how do i kill all procces having "speedlink" in their name ?
03:10	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay!
03:10	<slackern>	Old: 'pgrep speedlink' will show what pids match speedlink
03:10	<amphi>	Old: IMHO, a sane way to do this is to have the script start the server and write the PID to a pidfile in, say, /var/run, and then the stop script will just kill [-9]  `cat /var/run/$PIDFILE`
03:10	<Old>	gave me nada..
03:11	<slackern>	Old: 'pkill speedlink' should kill them all im not so used to it but i belive it will.
03:11	<ruchbah>	nickpresta -- it will be near the top under Section "InputDevice"
03:11	<Old>	didnt work
03:11	<Old>	I have a few "screen -R speedlink" running
03:11	<deadlycow21>	can anyone help me with ndiswrapper... I have a WG311v3 by NETGEAR, i cannot get this to work... My card is on the compatablity list, but it doesn't appear to work, can anyone please tell me how to get this working? is it even compatable?
03:11	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay, I'm just logged in.
03:11	<kuja>	Taru: Okay, so now you're inside GNOME?
03:13	<kuja>	Taru: If you're on GNOME now, right click on your desktop then click "Create Launcher"
03:13	<deadlycow21>	can anyone help me with ndiswrapper... I have a WG311v3 by NETGEAR, i cannot get this to work... My card is on the compatablity list, but it doesn't appear to work, can anyone please tell me how to get this working? is it even compatable?
03:13	<Taru>	Kuja: Let me log XChat on my computer now.
03:13	<kuja>	Okay

03:14	<Taru>	Kuja: Finally on my computer.
03:14	<kuja>	Okay cool.
03:14	<I_Love_DRM>	I accidendly deleted some things from the notification area (Speaker icon etc) how do I get them back?
03:14	<Taru>	Kuja: It was already there.
03:14	<kuja>	Taru: sudo apt-get install gtkpod exfalso
03:15	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay.
03:15	<nickpresta>	If someone can help me with this, I will love you forever. It's not much, but it has promise =)
03:16	<Taru>	Kuja: Separately?
03:16	<kuja>	Taru: Just that entire command
03:16	<kuja>	Run it from gnome-terminal
03:16	<Taru>	Kuja: I did that and it didn't find it.
03:16	<kuja>	Oh.. hmm
03:16	<HellDragon>	im getting crazy
03:16	<HellDragon>	damn sound
03:16	<Taru>	Kuja: I ran GTKPOD only.
03:17	<NytShade>	I've got a question about choosing which build of Ubuntu to install. I've got a Athlon 64 processor, but am I correct in understanding Automatix will not work with that build?
03:17	<kuja>	Taru: 'sudo apt-get install gtkpod' -- Doesn't work?
03:17	<DBO>	HellDragon, you cant reboot?
03:17	<thrice`>	you'd sacrifice cpu power just to use automatrix?
03:18	<thrice`>	!automatrix
03:18	<ubotu>	Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, thrice`
03:18	<Taru>	Kuja: No, "gtkpod exfalso" together didn't work.
03:18	<NytShade>	I'm a complete beginer, so yes if that's what it takes to make it look beter, I'd cosider it.
03:18	<Taru>	Kuja: Now "sudo apt-get install exfalso" is not working for me.
03:18	<kuja>	Taru: Type: sudo apt-get install gtkpod
03:18	<Taru>	Kuja: That is done.
03:19	<kuja>	Taru: Connect your iPod.
03:19	<Taru>	Kuja: It is connected.
03:19	<NytShade>	I can't even seem to get it to recognise my resolution can go above 1024.
03:19	<Taru>	Kuja: "E Couldn't find package exfalso"
03:19	<kuja>	Taru: Forget about exfalso for now.
03:19	<I_Love_DRM>	Hi Guys -    I accidendly deleted some things from the notification area (Speaker icon etc) how do I get them back?
03:19	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay.
03:20	<kuja>	Taru: Type: gtkpod
03:20	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay.
03:20	<kuja>	Taru: Then see if you can read from your iPod.
03:20	<Taru>	Kuja: Yes, that works.
03:20	<kuja>	So all your music is there?
03:20	<Taru>	Kuja: Let me check.
03:21	<Taru>	Kuja: Yes, it's all there.
03:21	<Taru>	=)

03:22	<hypnox>	anyone know why my /dev/dsp is permanently 'busy' even though alsa is supposed to be mixing and emulating oss?
03:22	<nickpresta>	@I_Love_DRM: Right click on your taskbar and click "Add Applet/Application to Panel"
03:22	<kuja>	Taru: What horrible songs?
03:22	<nickpresta>	Hi Mau

03:24	<bur[n] er>	I_Love_DRM: right click the panel, add to panel
03:24	<Taru>	Kuja: Now, why the hell won't exfalso work??
03:24	<Taru>	Kuja: What else to download and install?
03:24	<bur[n] er>	hoaryLiveCD: damn... hoary is old ;)
03:25	<bur[n] er>	hypnox: is your user part of the "audio" group?
03:25	<hypnox>	yup
03:25	<kuja>	Taru: It says there's no installation candidate for exfalso?
03:25	<kwtm>	suspekt: Is it a wine problem that you have, or should you just set your entire desktop to 640x480 before activating wine?
03:25	<bur[n] er>	hypnox: you're sure /dev/dsp permissions are correct?
03:25	<Taru>	Kuja, No, but Azureus says that :/
03:26	<hypnox>	+rw for group audio
03:26	<hoaryLiveCD>	yeah - i made a server setup with apache2 using a falsh drive to show people
03:26	<kuja>	Taru: Setting up Java is a bit more complicated.
03:26	<bur[n] er>	hypnox: what if you just chmod 777 /dev/dsp?
03:26	<Taru>	Kuja: "E: Couldnt' find package exfalso"
03:26	<Taru>	Kuja: I see.
03:26	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: yeah - i made a server setup with apache2 using a falsh drive to show people
03:27	<hypnox>	nope.. its busy not permission problems
03:27	<amphi>	hypnox: you perhaps need to use the alsa dmix plugin
03:27	<bur[n] er>	hypnox: ok ok, i believe you... i don't know hte answer though :\
03:27	<kuja>	Taru: Type: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
03:27	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay.
03:28	<hypnox>	amphi , am doing, doesnt do it for me yet somehow
03:28	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: are you a tech?
03:28	<bur[n] er>	hoaryLiveCD: in my professional career, yes
03:28	<bur[n] er>	hoaryLiveCD: however, i administer windows servers on a day to day basis :\  linux is for fun
03:28	<kuja>	Taru: Are there any commented lines that you missed and should be uncommented?
03:28	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: lol... unprofessional answer
03:29	<k4st`>	For some reason I can't get mod_userdir to work w/ dapper's apache2 package
03:29	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: yeah linux is for gurus
03:29	<amphi>	hypnox: I tried dmix, it seemed to work, but I like my box to only make one noise at a time  ;)
03:29	<Taru>	Kuja: All "deb http:/" and "deb-src" are uncommented.
03:29	<nomasteryoda|w>	not exactly true... by any sense of the word guru
03:30	<bur[n] er>	hoaryLiveCD: I've installed a few debian machines as simpel samba servers, but that's the extent
03:30	<nomasteryoda|w>	Ubuntu is as close to perfect as could be for ANY OS
03:30	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: do you like windows server better than linux
03:30	<tulga>	I need install tomcat on dapper. where I find good howto?
03:30	<amphi>	bur[n] er: then you can peacefully liberate their machines when they have to upgrade for vista ;)
03:30	<bur[n] er>	hoaryLiveCD: i haven't found a good exchange replacement yet, but I wouldn't say I "like" windows ;)
03:30	<wims>	i was just able to enable ati drivers after trying for days yay !
03:30	<mugzie>	can u get rhapsity on here
03:30	<nomasteryoda|w>	wims, great
03:31	<coucho>	later dudes
03:31	<nomasteryoda|w>	persistance pays off
03:31	<bur[n] er>	amphi: i would love to... ubuntu is soooooooo close... dapper is amazing
03:31	<k4st`>	this line: Include /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/*.load should be loading up mod_userdir, but everything i can see tells me its not working
03:31	<mugzie>	but ubuntu kinda limited since its linux
03:31	<nomasteryoda|w>	bur[n] er, yes it is and the installer on the live disk rocks
03:31	<mugzie>	or maybe i just cant do what i want
03:32	<wims>	one little thing, i'm using dual head, but i can't move one program from one screen to the other, i have to keep the window on the screen i started it on, does anybody know how i can change it so that it's basically one big desktop?
03:32	<nomasteryoda|w>	limited?
03:32	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: lol... I just put together this simle script with some folders with pages and data on a flash drive to set up apache2 on LiveCD to introduce some peole to linux
03:32	<nomasteryoda|w>	hoaryLiveCD, cool
03:32	<bur[n] er>	nomasteryoda|w: i have yet to get espresso to get passed disk partitioning, but it looks promising
03:32	<mugzie>	how would i make a live cd
03:32	<bur[n] er>	er... s/espresso/ubiquity
03:32	<hoaryLiveCD>	bur[n] er: lol... yeah
03:32	<mugzie>	i would like to test linux on my desktop
03:32	<nomasteryoda|w>	bur[n] er, if you tried LVM, then that requires a reboot after starting it..
03:32	<nomasteryoda|w>	then it will install properly
03:32	<mugzie>	i have it on my old old old laptop so its veryslow
03:32	<hoaryLiveCD>	nomasteryoda|w: lol... yeah
03:32	<amphi>	bur[n] er: ISTR reading about something called openexchange, dunno how much of a dropin replacement it is
03:33	<bur[n] er>	amphi: openxchange doesn't quite cut it and it's far from free
03:33	<hoaryLiveCD>	nomasteryoda|w: are you a tech?
03:33	<nomasteryoda|w>	we had that issue yesterday at our LUG meeting where satempler installed Ubuntu dapper F7 over his Kubuntu
03:33	<kuja>	Taru: Check the private message I sent you.

03:36	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: via samba? yes
03:36	<h3h_timo>	bur[n] er, how do you do it?
03:37	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: drag n drop ;)
03:37	<MorbidHunger>	unless hes on a mac!!
03:37	<MorbidHunger>	which wouldnt make sense if he was in #ubuntu
03:37	<h3h_timo>	bur[n] er, yeah, but will that acutally add it to the library.. like in rythmbox?
03:37	<hoaryLiveCD>	nomasteryoda|w: to download tunes
03:37	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: open nautilus... ctrl+L... smb://computerwithsharedfiles/music... drag and drop into rhythmbox or something that supports gnomevfs
03:37	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: you can also do a samba mount
03:38	<mugzie>	but wine has cannot work on some programs?
03:38	<MorbidHunger>	it works with most
03:38	<h3h_timo>	bur[n] er, will you send that again?? lol somehow it just dissappeared?
03:38	<mugzie>	lets say i wanted to run like albleton live or fl studios will it run that?
03:38	<MorbidHunger>	most likeley
03:38	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: open nautilus... ctrl+L... smb://computerwithsharedfiles/music... drag and drop into rhythmbox or something that supports gnomevfs
03:38	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: you can also do a samba mount
03:39	<MorbidHunger>	/usr/X11R6/bin/
03:39	<MorbidHunger>	http://www.transgaming.com/
03:39	<MorbidHunger>	that runs everything
03:39	<MorbidHunger>	sorry about the /usr/X11R6/bin/
03:39	<h3h_timo>	bur[n] er, yeah, i tried to just right clik on the share and mount it, but rythmbox couldnt see the mount
03:39	<mugzie>	ok
03:39	<nomasteryoda|w>	hoaryLiveCD, to play them actually... very cool package
03:40	<bur[n] er>	h3h_timo: where chances are you didn't mount it correctly.... if it's mounted, any app should work.  amarok, rhythmbox, listen, quodlibet, beep-media-player, xmms, etc.
03:40	<Old>	How do i kill all proccess having speedlink in them ?
03:40	<h3h_timo>	bur[n] er, thanks

03:40	<hoaryLiveCD>	nomasteryoda|w: sounds vert cool... can i get a looks see
03:40	<_pm>	for the 6.06 version
03:40	<Taru>	Kuja: I sent so many PMs!
03:40	<bur[n] er>	!tell _pm about RestrictedFormats
03:40	<Old>	Someone please?: How do i kill all proccess having speedlink in them ?
03:41	<kuja>	Taru: You're not registered.
03:41	<sponix>	_pm:  http://mplayerhq.hu download link has some codecs
03:41	<Taru>	Kuja: ><
03:41	<amphi>	Old: ps aux | grep speedlink and kill 'em individually; they're all screen processes, no?
03:41	<bur[n] er>	sponix: that was is so hard compared to the wiki link
03:41	<MorbidHunger>	anyone know where i can get libfglrx_pp.so.1
03:41	<Old>	yeah, they're screen processes
03:41	<Taru>	Kuja: Well, exfalso package not found yet :/
03:41	<bur[n] er>	MorbidHunger: did you follow the wiki about the ati binary drivers?
03:41	<Old>	Is there a way to kill them auto? :)
03:41	<bur[n] er>	!tell MorbidHunger about ati
03:41	<Taru>	Kuja: Just installed Amarok.
03:41	<kuja>	Taru: From IRC, type: "/ns register password", where "password" is your password.
03:41	<_pm>	sponix: there is the mplayer in some repositorie?
03:42	<amphi>	Old: you can kill all the screen processes...
03:42	<bur[n] er>	_pm: check your messages
03:42	<Old>	root 17799 0.0 0.0 4192 1648 ? Ss 03:04 0:00 SCREEN -R speedlink
03:42	<Old>	root 17949 0.0 0.0 3924 996 pts/0 S+ 03:11 0:00 screen -S speedlink

03:42	<Old>	what it says
03:42	<Taru>	Kuja: Okay.
03:42	<Old>	that's what it says (Sorry for copy/past)
03:42	<MorbidHunger>	thats scary
03:42	<_pm>	bur[n] er: i read it, but i must play a wmv video
03:42	<Old>	When i kill one it gets back again i think
03:42	<MorbidHunger>	can i install rpms?
03:42	<bur[n] er>	i can play wmvs... did you try totem-xine _pm?
03:43	<bur[n] er>	MorbidHunger: yes, via alien
03:43	<_pm>	let me try it
03:43	<bur[n] er>	MorbidHunger: but it's desirable to find a deb instead of an rpm
03:43	<hoaryLiveCD>	Old: try System Monitor and Kill first one
03:43	<Old>	hoaryLiveCD, system monitor?
03:44	<bur[n] er>	Old: or just "killall screen"
03:44	<Old>	No i run other screen commands aswell
03:44	<MorbidHunger>	meh
03:44	<MorbidHunger>	ill jsut run apt-get
03:44	<Taru>	Kuja: Says, "The nickname [Taru]  is already registered."
03:44	<hoaryLiveCD>	Old: Applications->	System Tools->	System Monitor
03:44	<tulga>	can I use blackdown's JDK instead of Sun JDK for tomcat?
03:44	<Old>	I dont run graphical ubuntu, I run ubuntu server.
03:45	<kuja>	Taru: Haha sucker.
03:45	<Taru>	Kuja: ?
03:45	<bur[n] er>	Old: you can use "ps ax" and "kill (PID#)"
03:45	<kuja>	Taru: Anyways, you made the changes I told you to, right?
03:45	<Taru>	Kuja: Yes.
03:45	<hoaryLiveCD>	or killall speedlink
03:45	<kuja>	Taru: Then from the terminal type: sudo apt-get update
03:46	<_pm>	if i install the beta version, how can i update it when the final version comes out? a apt-get upgrade will do the updatE?
03:46	<Taru>	Kuja: I did.
03:46	<Taru>	Kuja: Doing it again lol.
03:46	<Taru>	Kuja: "Done"
03:46	<Old>	Taru, when typing someones name, ex, if he is named "kuja" type, ku then press *tab*, the nick will pop-up
03:47	<kuja>	Taru: Now try installing exfalso again.
03:47	<Taru>	Old: Okay, thanks ^^
03:47	<tulga>	I cannot use sun-j2sdk for dapper. which repository use???
03:47	<Old>	np Taru
03:47	<Taru>	Old: I typed "Ku" and pressed *tab* and nothing; ;
03:47	<wims>	hmmm, there seems like there's no wine package for 64 breezy in the wine repository, does that mean i have to get the source and build it myself?
03:47	<amphi>	Taru: what client?
03:48	<Old>	exactly, what mirc client are you using... ?
03:48	<Taru>	XChat
03:48	<kuja>	Taru: Because my nickname is in lowercase.
03:48	<kuja>	It doesn't start with 'K', it starts with 'k'
03:48	<Taru>	Kuja: Oh!
03:48	<amphi>	Taru: xchat does tab completion I believe
03:48	<Taru>	kuja, There!
03:48	<Old>	;)
03:48	<kuja>	:)
03:48	<Taru>	lol
03:48	<amphi>	Taru: irssi'll deal with case errors
03:49	<Taru>	amphi, Thanks^^
03:49	<kuja>	amphi: He's new, better not introduce him to ncurses madness.
03:49	<Taru>	lol
03:49	<Taru>	amphi, I see^^
03:49	<amphi>	kuja: "ncurses's austere beauty", shurely ;)
03:50	<Old>	I give up with webmin
03:50	<Old>	5hours, waste of time.
03:50	<amphi>	Old: just use ssh ;)
03:50	<Old>	I cant, it's annoying :((
03:50	<Taru>	kuja, "E: Couldn't find package exfalso"
03:50	<kuja>	Hm...
03:50	<Old>	I want to give my users access trough a page, so they can start/close their server
03:51	<kuja>	Um, is exfalso only in the Dapper repositories? Anyone know?
03:51	<amphi>	Old: ah...
03:51	<Old>	easy login, or whatever. 1 account, whatever. I just need it..
03:52	<maike-maus>	is it possible to install the system (dapper flight4) permanently WITHOUT using the espresso  installer?
03:52	<Old>	amphi, you got any clues of how todo an alias? ex ./speedlink would do screen ./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 12 -port 27031 +map de_dust2 % ?
03:52	<amphi>	Old: why not just have the server start at boot time?
03:52	<Old>	amphi
03:52	<Old>	woot, good idea
03:52	<Old>	how todo that? :D
03:52	<planetcall>	goodmorning
03:53	<amphi>	Old: write an init script for it, stick it in /etc/init.d and use update-rc.d to make the runlevel symlinks
03:53	<zenlunatic>	anyone know how to turn off how windows redraw while you move them?
03:53	<amphi>	Old: you could use an existing script as a skeleton, and modify it
03:53	<kuja>	Taru: Not sure what's wrong with exfalso
03:53	<amphi>	zenlunatic: I know in openbox ;)
03:53	<Old>	amphi, where is it ?
03:53	<amphi>	Old: where is what?
03:54	<zenlunatic>	amphi, hey its jhenn
03:54	<Old>	nevermind, how would a init.d script look like ?
03:54	<Taru>	kuja, :/
03:54	<amphi>	zenlunatic: I suspected as much ;)
03:54	<amphi>	Old: look at some of the ones in /etc/init.d
03:54	<Old>	can i use cd /home/blabla and underneeth it start the server ?
03:55	<amphi>	Old: why do you need to do that?
03:55	<Old>	amphi, how would it else know where to start the server?
03:55	<amphi>	Old: what do you mean, where? Where the binary is?
03:56	<Old>	amphi, the dir is /home/speedlink/ and the command is: ./hlds_run -game cstrike +maxplayers 12 -port 27031 +map de_dust2 %
03:56	<Old>	I dont even know how a init.d script looks like, I looked at it , but i dont know how it works out. Should "PATH=" be init aswell?
03:57	<Old>	Could you perhaps give me an example on pastebin amphi ?
03:57	<amphi>	Old: you can specify absolute paths
03:57	<Old>	I'll write one, one second
03:57	<Old>	and show you how i did it
03:57	<Old>	!pastebin
03:57	<ubotu>	rumour has it, pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
03:58	<mugzie>	yo how do i know whats my user name
03:58	<Zizou>	Hi... does any body running xgl?
03:58	<Old>	amphi, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14425 - would this work?
03:58	<bur[n] er>	mugzie: whoami
03:59	<bur[n] er>	mugzie: type that at a terminal
03:59	<mugzie>	ok
03:59	<MorbidHunger>	your bur[n] er
03:59	<amphi>	Old: I have no idea, I know nothing about that server
04:00	<amphi>	Old: for instance, what is the +map arg? does that need to point at some data file?
04:00	<Old>	amphi, it's a game-server, I just need to know if that looks correctly (dont bother about the ./hlds_run path)
04:00	<mr_foamfingermak>	test
04:00	<mr_foamfingermak>	omg im still on!??
04:00	<Old>	amph, no no, dont bother about the ./hlds_run line, it's correct
04:00	<mr_foamfingermak>	n e 1 c this?
04:00	<Old>	mr_foamfingermak, no
04:00	<Old>	mr_foamfingermak, we dont see it, type something..
04:00	<amphi>	Old: why are you using screen?
04:01	<Old>	what should i use? Im new to ubuntu
04:01	<Old>	I feel so pathethic sometimes...
04:01	<kuja>	Taru: Try installing Gaim too: sudo apt-get install gaim
04:01	<Tidus>	screen is a useful tool
04:01	<amphi>	Tidus: why would you run a server in screen?
04:01	<mugzie>	when i type in codes like this one
04:01	<Old>	what should i use iyho ?
04:02	<mugzie>	 wine "/home/USERNAME/.wine/c/Program Files/Windows Media Player/mplayer2.exe" it says file not found
04:02	<amphi>	Old: does it spew messages to the console while it's running?

04:02	<amphi>	Tidus: daemons normally run detached from a terminal
04:02	<Tidus>	i run game servers in screen all the time.
04:02	<Tidus>	but most game servers hang on to the terminal

04:04	<rayston>	hello
04:04	<Taru>	kuja, Soft rice is much better because you can just keep eating it, hard rice can get full off of ; ;
04:05	<Taru>	kuja, Rather unpleasant at that!
04:05	<kuja>	You and your silly Filipino cooking style.
04:05	<Kyral>	Taru: not true!

04:07	<mugzie>	when using wine do u have to like always have it open or how do u install programs?
=== blanky is now known as blank_
04:07	<eggzeck>	 you have to have win open while running programs?
04:07	<eggzeck>	s/win/wine/
04:08	<eggzeck>	I think most wine users get confused about it or how it works.
04:08	<wims>	doesn't wine work on 64 bit ubuntu ?
04:08	<Kyral>	you have to use the "wine" program to preface the install command I think
04:08	<Kyral>	and on some distros it "associates" with wine automagically
04:08	<Kyral>	but I have no clue, I don't use Wien
04:09	<Kyral>	wine even
04:09	<mugzie>	so letssay i wanna install windows media player 9 how would i do that
04:09	<rayston>	hey, my second HD on my new install of UBUNTU seems to be mounted as Root, making it so that I effectively cant use it for anything, I can make folders in it, but not any other files, any ideas on how to fix?
04:09	<MorbidHunger>	how do i force the intall of a .deb
04:09	<Kyral>	mugzie: Install VLC :P
04:09	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: not wise
04:09	<MorbidHunger>	true
04:10	<T`>	i dont have chkconfig installed by default.. whats the equivalent in ubuntu?
04:10	<T`>	anyway to tweak which daemons i want to enable.. etc.
04:10	<mugzie>	um naw i just wanted windows 11 i just used 9 as a example
04:10	<Taru>	kuja, Gaim was already installed to the newest version.
04:10	<kuja>	Okay cool.
04:10	<Taru>	kuja, I want exfalso!
04:10	<kuja>	You can run it if you want to get on MSN.
04:10	<Kyral>	T`: sysvconf?
04:10	<eggzeck>	MorbidHunger, dpkg --force-help
04:11	<Kyral>	T`: or something like that
04:11	<T`>	dont hqave that either.. hmm
04:11	<Kyral>	T`: you have to install it :P
04:11	<mugzie>	so i just install a program regularly with wine
04:11	<mugzie>	?
04:11	<Compuqiz>	hey guys I'm installing ubuntu for the first time and came to a problem. What is "postinst warning: overwriting possible-customised configuration file"?
04:11	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: why do you want to force it?
=== Compuqiz is now known as Compuwiz
04:12	<eggzeck>	mugzie, first off, you can't install EVERYTHING with wine
04:12	<eggzeck>	mugzie, it has to be supported.
04:12	<mugzie>	yea i understand that
04:12	<MorbidHunger>	i cant seem to get the ati control panel working. so i got the file that it said it needed and it wont install
04:12	<mugzie>	hmmm is paltalk supported
04:12	<mugzie>	?
04:12	<eggzeck>	mugzie, go to the wine website for a list of supported programs.
04:12	<amphi>	Compuwiz: if it's a first install, you can ignore that IMHO
04:12	<Taru>	brb
04:12	<mugzie>	whats the wine website again hehe
04:12	<eggzeck>	the power of google is awesome.
04:12	<MorbidHunger>	www.winehq.com
04:13	<mugzie>	thanks
04:13	<eggzeck>	heh.
04:13	<rayston>	any ideas on how to make my second HD accessible to all users?
04:13	<Compuwiz>	yeah it is the first install
04:13	<MorbidHunger>	any ideas on how to make my second HD accessible to me?
04:13	<Compuwiz>	but now I'm stuck at a command prompt and I dont know how to continue
04:13	<eggzeck>	MorbidHunger, if it won't install, forcing it will not make it work.
04:13	<MorbidHunger>	it says it cant overrite some file
04:14	<mugzie>	where the supported programz list located at?
04:14	<eggzeck>	perhaps permissions are bad? And make sure you *want* it to overwrite that file. (whatever it may be)
04:15	<MorbidHunger>	meh
04:15	<Compuwiz>	so I need to change the permissions of that one file?
04:15	<thev>	is there a package for gimp 2.3?
04:15	<T`>	anyone running ubuntu on a laptop?
04:15	<eggzeck>	Compuwiz, that was my reply for MorbidHunger not you
04:15	<Compuwiz>	oh, haha. my bad
04:15	<amphi>	!tell T` about ask
04:16	<T`>	i'm curious if you guys do any harddisk power management
04:16	<amphi>	T`: I use hdparm to spin down the disk here
04:16	<mugzie>	ok the program is ok paltalk is supported so do i just install regular o how would i do that?
04:16	<T`>	amphi, manually?
04:16	<T`>	amphi, or you run the daemon?
04:16	<T`>	i see soemthing in /etc/init.d
04:16	<amphi>	T`: no, an acpi script sets the timeout
04:17	<T`>	amphi, umm i c.. where can i find that? think you can help me set that up please?
=== thev is now known as theverant
04:17	<eggzeck>	mugzie, looks like you need to read about using wine. Please do so.
04:17	<amphi>	T`: look at the scripts under /etc/acpi
04:17	<GaiaX11>	Why is that I cannot connect to my hotmail through konqueror? I give the right passw but it don't access my account? I think it is about certificate, but i do not know how to set up them.
04:17	<T`>	amphi, i got a bunch of them
04:17	<amphi>	T`: there may well be a gui tool in gnome for this; I wrote my scripts myself
04:17	<Taru>	kuja, To move all my songs to my harddrive from i-pod, do I extract them from database?
04:18	<mugzie>	theres a winechat right?
04:18	<Compuwiz>	...any ideas how to fix the postinst error?
04:18	<eggzeck>	mugzie: http://www.winehq.org/site/howto
04:18	<kuja>	Taru: Probably
04:18	<T`>	amphi, are these scripts executed when you press buttons or something? where are those hooks?
04:18	<Taru>	kuja, Okay.
04:18	<T`>	or perhaps acpi events
04:18	<h3h_timo>	is there a way to edit the gnome keychain
04:18	<amphi>	T`: pm?
04:18	<T`>	sure
04:19	<tagabasak_>	hi all
04:19	<Quartlow>	New user here, I'm running this from a cd, is there any way to get to my hard drive?
04:20	<h3h_timo>	Quartlow, yes, get the install cd, and then run the installer
04:20	<amphi>	T`: bah, you're not identified to services
04:20	<T`>	oops.. sec
04:20	<tagabasak_>	anyony here can help me on how can i repair my grub?
04:20	<T`>	amphi, actually i am
04:20	<Quartlow>	h3h_timo, so it can't be done from the live cd then?
04:20	<T`>	-NickServ- You have already identified
04:21	<h3h_timo>	Quartlow, not to my knowledge
04:21	<Quartlow>	Cool, thanks for the quick answer. h3h. I snooped around and couldn't figure it out.
04:21	<Tenshi>	how do I get my cups client to show printers that are broadcast/shared on the network ?
04:21	<laserline>	Quartlow, there should be an icon from your desktop... double click on that and it should run esspresso installer....unless you have an older version of ubuntu, but i know dapper has it... does breezy too
04:22	<Taru>	kuja, It is saying that the songs did not match file type and so it will not export all my songs...
04:22	<h3h_timo>	Quartlow, maybe ^^ that works
04:22	<h3h_timo>	lol
04:22	<Taru>	Wonder what happened to my songs on my i-pod.
04:22	<kuja>	Taru: Err, figure it out later.
04:22	<Taru>	><\
04:22	<kuja>	I think I need to try and sleep a little bit now
04:22	<Quartlow>	Laser the only one on the dektop is one for the cdrom.
04:22	<Taru>	Sleep ><
04:22	<Taru>	Peace Kuja!
04:22	<tagabasak_>	how can i repair my grub? i can boot to my ubuntu when i installed windows.. anyone can help me?
04:22	<laserline>	Quartlow what version of the Ubuntu live CD do you have
04:22	<kuja>	Taru: Just leave your computer on.
04:23	<Taru>	kuja, lol
04:23	<frank__>	can I create a new partition in my empty space on the same drive that my running ubuntu is on?
04:23	<Quartlow>	Good question, I just downloaded the iso yesterday and this only the second time i've used it. Kind of test driving
04:24	<Quartlow>	2.21
04:24	<tagabasak_>	how can i repair my grub? i can boot to my ubuntu when i installed windows.. anyone can help me?
04:24	<Managu>	Quartlow:  It should definitely be possible to access your hard drive from the live CD.  It's also very likely to be read-only access.  How easy it'll be to set up is another question
04:24	<h3h_timo>	how do you open the gnome keychain?
04:24	<Quartlow>	10/30/2005
04:24	<Managu>	!tell tagabasak_ about grub
04:25	<ricardo>	anyone here hi.. i installed ati drivers.. now i installed cedega im running diablo 2 a windows 98 game with 8mb video and im lagging my FPS are suuky in the game..
04:25	<Taru>	Anyone know why I cannot apt-get frostwire or exfalso?
04:25	<h3h_timo>	!exfalso
04:25	<ubotu>	h3h_timo: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
04:25	<Taru>	Keeps saying "E: Couldn't find package frostwire"
04:25	<h3h_timo>	what is exfalso
04:25	<Taru>	exfalso yes please!
04:26	<Quartlow>	Managu, read only would be fine. I just wanted access to my bookmarks, some jpg and mp3 files.
04:26	<Quartlow>	I just want to get more familar with it before I go trying to install it
04:26	<Taru>	exfalso is a program that allows you to organize song tabs and stuff.
04:26	<psYchotic>	ladies and gents, good evening
04:26	<psYchotic>	I have a little question
04:27	<Taru>	h3h_timo, Like make all your songs look neat and in good order in your computer and i-pod.
04:27	<psYchotic>	why is it that my at jobs seem to hang when they were issued by my normal user, while it all works wonderfully well when issued by root?
04:28	<Managu>	quartlow: I don't know offhand how to find the partition using the gui.  From the command line, you can "sudo fdisk -l" (careful, dangerous command if mistyped! that's a lowercase L) to find the partition name of your windows drive.  If you've got nothing special installed and only 1 hard drive, it's probably /dev/hda1 (first partition on primary master drive).
04:29	<PORDO>	I DID something weird tonight...
04:30	<psYchotic>	it's kinda driving me nuts, my username isn't listen in /etc/at.deny, but my at jobs seem to run forever without actually doing anything
04:30	<PORDO>	i was sitting in an caf in san francisco, typing esperanto in a jabber conference room on my nokia 770 over a wi-fi connection.
04:30	<Managu>	quartlow: once that's done, you can type "sudo mount <device name>	/mnt -o umask=777" to mount that partition under /mnt.  It will then be accessible under the gui at places ->	filesystem ->	mnt

04:32	<dust>	i've got a ipod problem. i'm using 5.10 and installed banshee and gtkpod but my computer isn't registering the ipod properly
04:32	<Quartlow>	Mangu, I tried the mount command, once I found a terminal. as mount /dev/hda1 . and got the response can't find /dev/hda1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
04:33	<psYchotic>	Quartlow, is your partition an NTFS or a FAT one?
04:33	<Managu>	quartlow: "sudo mount /dev/hda /mnt -o umask=777"
04:33	<dust>	in the wiki it mentions something for hoary and i was thinking of trying it, is it a bad idea-- does anyone have any ideas?
04:33	<Managu>	quartlow: sorry, /dev/hda1 instead of /dev/hda
04:34	<Quartlow>	Mang, the sudo mount line returned this,,, you must specify file system type
04:34	<pianoboy3333>	http://www.hilineeng.com/electrical_controls/food_processing/food_processing.jpg
04:35	<Managu>	quartlow: that's unfortunate.  Even with the correction I made?
04:35	<Quartlow>	PsYchotic , i'm guessing fat since it has windows installed
04:35	<mugzie>	hey i just installed something but i dont see it in my application where are the stuff i installed at with wine?
04:36	<tagabasak_>	a newbie question here, what is the default root password for ubuntu live cd 5.10?
04:36	<psYchotic>	coz if it's fat, you need to mount it like this "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/whatever -o umask=777"
04:36	<Quartlow>	ok sorry Manugo, now I get no such file or directory
04:36	<Managu>	tagabasak_: there is no root password
04:36	<mugzie>	anyone know
04:36	<tagabasak_>	Managu, ok thnx
04:36	<itrebal>	how can i setup printers? whats the Gnome program to do it? i dont use Gnome so i need to know the progrma name..
04:36	<Managu>	mugzie: ~/.wine/c_drive/Program Files/
04:36	<tagabasak_>	Managu, how can i use the root privilegde
04:36	<Managu>	mugzie: or something similar
04:37	<Managu>	!root
04:37	<ubotu>	Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
04:37	<tagabasak_>	Managu, when i typed su it ask me to enter a password?
04:37	<mugzie>	in terminal and there a way to add it to my start bar or something?
04:37	<Managu>	tagabasak_: yup.  And since there's no root password, "su" will always fail.
04:37	<itrebal>	tagabasak_: in the 'expert' install you can set it up to have a root password (i did this time, on accident)
04:38	<tagabasak_>	Managu, ok i get it now, i just type sudo -i
04:38	<itrebal>	tagabasak_: you would use sudo in stead, and if you REALLY want it you can do sudo passwd
04:38	<pianoboy3333>	Can someone help me with printing?
04:38	<Managu>	Quartlow: which isn't found?  /dev/hda1 or /mnt?
04:38	<itrebal>	pianoboy3333: i'm in the same boat, i dont use Gnome and dont know the program to setup up printers :/
04:39	<tagabasak_>	Managu, ok i get it now, i just type sudo -i
04:39	<Managu>	Quartlow: even better... what command did you decide on, exactly?
=== sub|at|alpopel is now known as sub|off

04:39	<eggzeck>	itrebal, System->Administration->Printing (I believe)
04:39	<mugzie>	im so confused
04:40	<itrebal>	eggzeck: that would make sense if i used gnome, but i dont (which is hte issue)
04:40	<dust>	does anyone have any usb device/ipod knowledge that they could share?
04:40	<eggzeck>	itrebal, oh I'm so sorry, I didn't read up
04:40	<Managu>	mugzie: wine doesn't integrate incredibly well with the gui.  If that sort of integration is important, you might investigate commercial software like CrossoverOffice or Cedega
04:40	<Quartlow>	OK Mangu now I get  mount point media/hda1 does not exist
04:41	<pianoboy3333>	Can someone help me with printing?
04:41	<mugzie>	ok but i just wana know how to open the program i just installed aka paltalk
04:41	<Managu>	Quartlow: what command did you decide on?  Could you type it here, letter by letter?
04:41	<jpe>	how do you add a disk permanently via the disks manager?
04:42	<Managu>	mugzie: probably the easiest thing to do is (a) cd to it's installed directory, and (b) run its executable with "wine blah.exe".
04:42	<itrebal>	pianoboy3333: nobody can help if they don't know whats wrong
04:42	<mugzie>	ok it shows it installed
04:42	<Managu>	mugzie or possibly even using nautilus -- I think there's an association installed by default
04:42	<theverant>	are there no Gimp 2.3 packages in apt-get?
04:42	<Zizou>	does any body here runs xgl?
04:42	<Managu>	mugzie: what shows who installed, and how?
04:42	<mugzie>	managu im so confused what ur saying lol im so new to this
04:42	<Quartlow>	this one,,,sudo mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/hda1 -o umask=777
04:43	<dust>	pianoboy3333: did you look in system-->admin-->printers
04:43	<mugzie>	in the maine menu of winetools i hit installed programs and it shows the program
04:43	<itrebal>	hell, i'll go into gnome :/
04:43	<mugzie>	all i wanna know is how can i open it is there a shortcut or what

04:47	<Quartlow>	ok. its there, but when I click on it it tells me "you do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "mnt"
04:47	<Managu>	Compuwiz: I realize that might be a bit tricky when you lack a gui, of course.
04:47	<amphi>	Aphostile: you could google and see if there's a specific driver for it
04:47	<Aphostile>	Yeah I wasn't having much luck there
04:48	<Compuwiz>	haha, yeah I have no idea how to do that....
04:48	<Managu>	Quartlow: hrmm.  /bonk me, I got the command wrong.  "sudo umount /mnt"  and then "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /mnt -o umask=000"
04:48	<Quartlow>	LOL
04:48	<Compuwiz>	especially when my computer that im installing linux on isnt connected to any internet/network...
04:48	<Centaur5>	Hey amphi, care to know what fixed my wireless?
04:48	<Managu>	Compuwiz: oh?  Getting it connected to a network would definitely be helpful
04:49	<Managu>	Compuwiz: there really isn't enough information in the stuff you've pasted above to diagnose your problem
04:49	<Compuwiz>	haha, getting it installed would be a better step first
04:49	<Compuwiz>	uhm
04:49	<Compuwiz>	let me see if I can get more information
04:49	<Managu>	!tell compuwiz about flood
04:49	<Quartlow>	Good job Managu!!!!!!!!!
04:50	<Managu>	Quartlow: that task should be easier, and I'm not sure why there wasn't just an icon on your desktop to do all that
04:50	<Managu>	quartlow: but then, I'm only really an intermediate user
04:50	<Aphostile>	it seems like perhaps r*dh*t supports it but they suck
04:50	<Quartlow>	well I'm only a second time user, so you look like an expert to me
04:51	<Quartlow>	now I just have to write that command down
04:51	<Compuwiz>	haha thanks, I get a little [enter] happy online. here is a path it gives me for the file. /ect/X11/xorg.conf.#############
04:51	<amphi>	Aphostile: what's the problem, it's just a bit slow>
04:51	<amphi>	?
04:52	<SD>	can anyone tell me why this command: "sudo tar zcvf backup myhomedir/ --exclude=myhomedir/.gconf" doesnt exclude correctly, but "sudo tar zcvf backup myhomedir/* --exclude=myhomedir/.gconf" (note the * after myhomedir) does?
04:52	<jpe>	is there any way to get the disks manager to add to /etc/fstab?
04:52	<jpe>	or should I just do it directly
04:52	<rayston>	can someone help me with a HD problem?
04:52	<Aphostile>	Well slow and the no eject thing but there is a program to solve that no?
04:52	<Managu>	Compuwiz: you want to look through /var/log/Xorg.0.log for lines that start with "(EE)".  One way to do that is to type "less /var/log/Xorg.0.log" and then press the keys [/]  [E]  [E]  [Enter] 
04:53	<Aphostile>	I am a bit of a Linux newbie... I had red hat installed once awhile back...  and i have worked with linux before so I'm not like totally clueless
04:53	<Dr_Willis>	:)
04:53	<amphi>	Aphostile: no eject>
04:53	<amphi>	?
04:54	<Dr_Willis>	you have at least 'skimmed the manual' lol.
04:54	<Aphostile>	it won't eject the cds
04:54	<Compuwiz>	okay I will try that
04:54	<Dr_Willis>	if a program is accessing the cd they will be 'locked'
04:54	<amphi>	Aphostile: it won't eject a live cd (unless you use the cp to ramdisk option (if it has one))
04:54	<Aphostile>	Well I've been a unix computer operator for years so I do know a little
04:54	<Dr_Willis>	many live cds have a 'toram' option you can use at boot time.
04:55	<Quartlow>	Manago and psYchotic... Thanks for the help!!!!!!! Now I can play around some
04:55	<Managu>	Quartlow: have fun =)
04:55	<Aphostile>	ahh ok
04:55	<Quartlow>	oh i will
04:55	<Aphostile>	well i guess ill just go ahead with the slowness and work my way out... i have the sound card params
04:55	<Aphostile>	thanks
04:55	<OPP>	hi
04:55	<OPP>	i have a p3 1ghz 256 ram well breezy run fine?
04:56	<Dr_Willis>	should run 'ok'
04:56	<Managu>	OPP: might be a little slow in the graphics department, but otherwise should be fine.
04:56	<amphi>	Aphostile: once you have ubuntu installed, you may be able to tweak it
04:56	<Dr_Willis>	may want to use a light weight window manager.  (like xfce)
04:56	<OPP>	ya
04:56	<OPP>	i dont want to do games or anything
04:56	<OPP>	just like watch movies or play music

04:57	<OPP>	cool
04:57	<metalhedd>	I've got some major install problems... I've tried installing dapper flight 5 and breezy both from working cd's.  breezy gets to the first reboot and then fails to load the kernel, so I edit the path to / instead of /boot and it loads but then fails to load some important modules and then I get 'can't access tty; job control turned off' i have a shell but it can't do much.
04:58	<OPP>	will drake run  you think?

05:00	<Compuwiz>	Managu I found an EE on the log, its funny "No devices detected"........even though it automatically detected my card and it is listed in the log also. Is this due to the page where it asks me to locate the position of it like PCI location and such? Also, stupid question...I did what you said, and now I cannot exit out of that log?
05:01	<Managu>	Compuwiz: press Q to quit

05:17	<amphi>	orangey: what happened with zmag?

05:21	<cocox>	Managu, but there is a way using script by console ??
05:21	<Managu>	cocox: sure.  That was what Dr_Willis offered, via ubotu.  Here's a repeat

05:22	<lowroad>	any idea on best way to extract the emails on thunderbird to my ubuntu thunderbird?
05:22	<Managu>	cocox: brief summary: use "apt-cache search blahpackagestiff" to get the package name (less any version info, dates, builds, etc), then "apt-get remove package name"

05:24	<cocox>	Managu, yes but i prefer to get involve with the console commands for use them anytime without a GUI

05:32	<mikebot>	how can i screen capture in mplayer?
05:32	<ubotu>	methinks frostwire is a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
05:33	<dli>	mikebot, run mplayer like, "mplayer -vo x11 "
05:33	<orangey>	I have to ask.. where does this "OMG PONIES" inside joke come from?
05:34	<vars>	orangey, have you ever been around a 6 year lod girl?
05:34	<orangey>	lod?
05:34	<Managu>	=old
05:34	<orangey>	Ok. so they like ponies..
05:34	<Dr_Willis>	Untill they see how dirty the things are.
05:34	<Dr_Willis>	:P
05:35	<orangey>	It's not new as I can recall from my childhood. how did we get involved?
05:35	<mikebot>	dli, sorry?
05:35	<vars>	Managu, no dice
05:36	<vars>	i tried to burn from a iso
05:36	<Managu>	vars: are the HD and the CD-R on the same IDE controller?
05:36	<tagabasak_>	dli, what do you mean by within chroot?
05:36	<mugzie>	how would i open the home directory in the terminal?
05:36	<dli>	tagabasak_, after the command chroot
05:36	<vars>	it's a laptop so i think so
05:36	<tagabasak_>	dli,ok
05:36	<|Sivik|>	how do i tell if a firewall is up or not
05:37	<|Sivik|>	i'm trying to ssh in and it says the connection is refused
05:37	<warren__>	Hello everyone, I am kinda new (totally actually) to linux, I am looking for some assistance in setting up a LVM share, so I can place my cross platform media onto one machine, would anyone mind feilding a few questions?
05:37	<vars>	mugzie, open a term an hit ls
05:37	<Managu>	vars: I'm a bit confused -- you certainly get a different error, no?  mkisofs shouldn't be involved at all
05:37	<|Sivik|>	!ssh
05:37	<ubotu>	ssh is, like, totally, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SSHHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdvancedOpenSSH
05:37	<vars>	i got that error once
05:37	<tagabasak_>	dli,it say cannot change root directory to grub-install
05:37	<vars>	so the mkisofs what does that refer to?
05:38	<lendyl>	help
05:38	<Managu>	vars: mkisofs is a program which creates an .iso image from a bunch of files
05:38	<warren__>	I have two SATA 300 GB Drives,  I want to make the empty space ( / )on the SDA and the whole new SDB drive span together into one big 500GB volume, so iTunes enjoys the placement of a single folder
05:38	<eggzeck>	|Sivik|, most likely you don't have an ssh server installed
05:38	<Managu>	vars: literally "make ISO filesystem"
05:38	<warren__>	Since my SDB is empty, should I make the 8E a primary or a Logical partition?
05:38	<mugzie>	i pressed ls but i dont get the pop up i wanna delete somthing in there
05:38	<HellDragonWeird>	im weird
05:38	<amphi>	vars: to burn an iso, just do cdrecord foo.iso (assuming /etc/default/cdrecord is correct)
05:38	<|Sivik|>	eggzeck: ok
05:39	<vars>	ok
05:39	<mugzie>	how would i do that get the home to open in a window? in terminal
05:39	<eggzeck>	|Sivik|, sudo apt-get install openssh-server
05:39	<Managu>	mugzie: how bout Places ->	home
05:39	<HellDragonWeird>	no, im weird im weird
05:39	<HellDragonWeird>	i ate one of my keyboard
05:39	<Taru>	How do I install frostwire ?
05:39	<dli>	tagabasak_, can you run " grub ", instead ?
05:39	<HellDragonWeird>	im weird
05:39	<eggzeck>	|Sivik|, once that's done, you should be able to ssh into the box. :)
05:39	<lendyl>	where can i find a technical help for ubuntu?
05:39	<HellDragonWeird>	i ate one of my keyboard key
05:39	<bimberi>	!frostwire
05:39	<ubotu>	it has been said that frostwire is a free peer-to-peer application that runs on the Gnutella network. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrostWireHowTo
05:39	<|Sivik|>	k
05:39	<HellDragonWeird>	the number between 3 and 5
05:39	<HellDragonWeird>	im weird
05:39	<Managu>	mugzie: if you really are averse to using the mouse, you can open the menus with alt-f1
05:39	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: I looked over those wiki help pages, but the I'm not sure which steps to use.  I've removed GRUB from the MBR and don't have Ubuntu installed on any partition, although I have partitions for it set up.  I am currently on a Knoppix live CD
05:39	<Taru>	Thank you ^^
05:39	<|Sivik|>	eggzeck, i knew i was missing something, but i couldn't remember
05:40	<HellDragonWeird>	im weir dim weirdir mei rwmiwmdi wmdiwe
05:40	<tagabasak_>	dli, im on grub now
05:40	<vars>	amphi,  well that gave me some new errors   9 cdrecord  fo.iso
05:40	<eggzeck>	|Sivik|, hehe, cool. I sometimes forget things too. :)
05:40	<mugzie>	no managu i have to do it through terminal cause im on ice lite
05:40	<|Sivik|>	eggzeck, thanks a bunch
05:40	<eggzeck>	|Sivik|, you're welcome.
05:40	<Managu>	mugzie: hrmm.  "nautilus &" , perhaps
05:40	<lendyl>	amphi, where could i find technical help for ubuntu?
05:41	<|Sivik|>	eggzeck, its now saying that the host key verification failed
05:41	<warren__>	Empty Secondary hard drive, and I am making it one big partition to add to my LVM, do I want to make it a primary or logical partition???
05:41	<amphi>	lendyl: what do you mean? you could ask in the channel...
05:41	<disinterseted_pe>	has anyone here successfully got windows media to play in ubuntu?
05:41	<Madpilot>	lendyl, here, or at help.ubuntu.com, or wiki.ubuntu.com, or at System->Help...
05:41	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: actually, dli and tagabasak_ are tackling a very, very similar problem.  You might want to scroll back and look at some of their conversation
05:41	<eggzeck>	|Sivik|, and then?
05:41	<lendyl>	ahhh... ok
05:41	<|Sivik|>	it goes back to the #
05:41	<Madpilot>	disinterseted_pe, wmv & wma files? of course.
05:41	<tagabasak_>	dli,what should i do next?
05:42	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: oh, wait.  Hold on, I'm confused
05:42	<disinterseted_pe>	ok what packages do i need to install for them?
05:42	<dli>	tagabasak_, within grub ?
05:42	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: what is it you're trying to accomplish?
05:42	<Madpilot>	ubotu, tell disinterseted_pe about restricted
05:42	<tagabasak_>	dli,yup
05:42	<vars>	amph cd record is looking for a -scsi   and telling me that thje 2.6 kernal hates it
05:42	<|Sivik|>	eggzeck, it talks about some crap about "IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY" and a bunch of other crap and then says Host key verification failed
05:42	<dli>	tagabasak_, " find /etc/hosts "
05:42	<amphi>	vars: it's scsi or ide?
05:43	<dli>	tagabasak_, we want to double check, it's hd0
05:43	<vars>	ide
05:43	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: the only OS I have set up successfully right now is Windows...I am just trying to get the MBR back in order so I can get into it, for starters
05:43	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	ssh ?
05:43	<disinterseted_pe>	ive been there
05:43	<vars>	in a gateway laptop i am 100% sure that is ide right
05:43	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, yes
05:43	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: then I have to figure out why Ubuntu won't install :P
05:43	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: have a Windows boot disk?
05:43	<amphi>	vars: do cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus
05:43	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: yes
05:43	<tagabasak_>	dli,file not found
05:43	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts
05:43	<dli>	tagabasak_, you didn't typo ?
05:43	<Madpilot>	disinterseted_pe, see the w32codecs info on that RestrictedFormats site
05:43	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: I tried fixboot and fixmbr and it can't boot the os
05:44	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: I knew what to do with windows9x; I don't know how windows2k+ work.
05:44	<tagabasak_>	dli, what is typo?
05:44	<dli>	tagabasak_, maybe, " find /boot/grub/menu.lst "
05:44	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, and then try ssh again?
05:44	<tagabasak_>	dli, sorry im really a newbie
05:44	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: but, honestly, the problem isn't a linux problem.  You need to reinstall the windows MBR
05:44	<disinterseted_pe>	ok ty
05:44	<amphi>	vars: take the number and put a line in /etc/default/cdrecord like CRD_DEVICE=ATA:1,0,0 where the '1,0,0' are the numbers that command shows you
05:44	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	yep
05:44	<Mr>	is this where yuo can go for help?
05:44	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, same thing
05:44	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: I agree
05:44	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	run the command on the client, not the server
05:44	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: I thought maybe I could get GRUB back up and use that though
05:45	<amphi>	vars: then you won't need to specify the device to cdrecord every time
05:45	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: since it used to work before I screwed up my linux partition
05:45	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: hrmm, I suppose that's a possibility.
05:45	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, already doing that, can a server not be a client for something else?
05:45	<Mr>	IS this where you go for help?
05:45	<tagabasak_>	dli, w8 did you mean that i should be on grub prompt?
05:45	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: lemme see
05:45	<Taru>	ubotu, sudo dpkg -i FrostWire-4.10.9-1.i586.deb, will not work why?
05:45	<|Sivik|>	let me try something
05:45	<ubotu>	Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Taru
05:45	<Madpilot>	Mr, it is - just ask a question, don't ask to ask
05:45	<dli>	tagabasak_, yes, within grub
05:46	<micker>	how do you "upgrade" releases?
05:46	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	I doubt it, funny though, whenever I get that message, deleting known_hosts does the trick
05:46	<Madpilot>	Taru, ubotu is a bot...
05:46	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: from a root command line, how bout you run "grub"
05:46	<atoponce>	Mr: depends on the help
05:46	<tagabasak_>	grub
05:46	<Managu>	linux_newbie2 (and pray that knoppix has grub)
05:46	<poimen>	gnome- and XGL rulez in ubuntu
05:46	<poimen>	:)
05:46	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: done
05:46	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, i have ssh server installed on this machine as well as the laptop and i can log in from the desktop to the laptop but not the laptop to the desktop
05:46	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, i get that error
05:46	<poimen>	I used gnome and xgl in suse and in ubuntu is better starnge maybe bacause we use gnome 2.14
05:46	<Taru>	ubotu, Thank you ^^
05:46	<ubotu>	no problem, Taru
05:47	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, can you tell me the right repo needed to install mplayer?
05:47	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	tried running the command on both ?
05:47	<tagabasak_>	dli, still not found =(
05:47	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: put it on your hard drive.  It's been a while since I did this, so I might not be remembering the incantations correctly.  Also keep in mind that we're in data-loss mode, so things could get better or they could get worse
05:47	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, no

05:48	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	it should be in your sources.list, just uncomment the lenes mentioning it
05:48	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: is it setup (hd0, 0)?
05:48	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, already did that, still doesn't find it
05:48	<kwtm>	Question: I installed krusader 1.7 even though Breezy/Dapper use krusader 1.6 (which doesn't work for me).  I have to use the --ignore-depends option, as in  "dpkg --ignore-depends=kdelibs4c2 -i /boxln/root/apt/archives/krusader_1.70.0-0kubuntu1_i386.deb" to get it to ignore the dependency problem.  But every time I try to install something else, apt-get tries to get rid of krusader.  What can I do to tell apt-get to continue ignor

05:49	<ubotu>	I heard pastebin is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
05:49	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, nope
05:49	<kwtm>	I tried using "pinning" in /etc/apt/preferences, but now apt-get won't install anything else.
05:49	<pppoe_dude>	hi. anyone knows of a good anime wallpaper site? something that compares to www.sexydesktop.co.uk?
05:49	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: that would wipe out your windows partition's boot sector, and you'd be back at reinstalling from there
05:49	<pppoe_dude>	sorry i guess this belongs in #ubuntu-offtopic... nm
05:49	<Dr_Willis>	pppoe_dude,  :P you pervert. :P
05:49	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	what happens when you sudo apt-get install mplayer-586 ?

05:50	<pppoe_dude>	Dr_Willis: lol

05:56	<Managu>	linux_newbie2:  The documentation I'm seeing doesn't really suggest a cure using grub
05:56	<feryana>	for me is impossible install a tar.gz
05:56	<feryana>	i do all good
05:56	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: tell me, what happens when you try to boot your machine now?
05:56	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	pastebin your new sources.list please

05:57	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, whats wrong
05:58	<atoponce>	Mr: not sure how to 'see' what driver without reconfiguring the xserver
05:58	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: at the least, you'll probably get grub back
05:58	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: that bug is fixed in plan 9 ;)
05:58	<Mr>	hmmm
05:58	<dli>	tagabasak_, now, " setup (hd0) "
05:58	<RemyLaptop>	hi guys, can anyone provide any information on setting my laptop up to dual-boot ubuntu and windows?
05:58	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: well, I have tried twice, with a Ubuntu CD I DLed today and with an Edubuntu 5.10 CD that has worked on other machines
05:58	<|Sivik|>	RamyLaptop: did you install windows first and then ubuntu?
05:58	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: they both fail when installing the base system :(
05:58	<Mr>	well i have booted from the live CD and the resolution was fine
05:58	<tagabasak_>	dli,done
05:58	<dli>	tagabasak_, make sure grub was run right after "chroot"
05:58	<|Sivik|>	RemyLaptop, did you install windows and then ubuntu?
05:58	<tagabasak_>	dli, is houl rebbot?
05:59	<dli>	tagabasak_, " quit "
05:59	<feryana>	so then, how I install a tar.gz???????? what I must do
05:59	<dli>	tagabasak_, " exit "
05:59	<Apostle^>	linux_newbie2, sounds like your HD is not clean
05:59	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: when you try to boot, do you get anything other than a generic "could not load operating system" message?  Anything at all?  Does GRUB say soemthing?  Is there a disk error?
05:59	<linux_newbie2>	ManaguL: running the CD check says they both have a problem with a file on the disk, but I know the edubuntu one has worked on another machine
05:59	<atoponce>	Mr: what version+
05:59	<Apostle^>	linux_newbie2, try formatting it clean
05:59	<RemyLaptop>	|Sivik| - I currently have ubuntu installed ( an no spare partitions), but i'm planning on going again completely from scratch...
05:59	<dli>	tagabasak_, you may reboot now
05:59	<atoponce>	?
05:59	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	I cn't see what's wrong, here's my sources.list if you want : http://fkraiem.no-ip.org/stuff/sources.list
05:59	<Mr>	5.10
05:59	<tagabasak_>	dli, ok
05:59	<Deedubb>	when is dapper going to be released?
05:59	<Mr>	some one i installed it from
05:59	<MorbidHunger>	never
05:59	<Apostle^>	!dapper
05:59	<ubotu>	**** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
05:59	<Mr>	i had the live DVD
05:59	<atoponce>	Deedubb: june 1st
05:59	<|Sivik|>	RemyLaptop, so you don't currently have windows installed?
05:59	<feryana>	because i see how to do it on the sites... but ./configure never work
05:59	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: before I did the fixmbr from the windows disk, GRUB gave an error 15
05:59	<Deedubb>	thank you
06:00	<RemyLaptop>	|Sivik| - no
06:00	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: oi, I remember error 15
06:00	<tagabasak_>	dli,hope it works *__*
06:00	<sponix>	whoever does the ubotu bot, it should be "then" for the last word of that dapper statement ;)
06:00	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: lemme see.  Maybe lilo would be more useful to you here.  It's a lot less testy on install
06:00	<MorbidHunger>	how long does it take to mount an image?
06:00	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: fine by me
06:00	<mikebot>	how can i screen capture in mplayer?
06:00	<amphi>	feryana: why are you trying to compile from source?
06:00	<Apostle^>	Managu, lilo is not used with ubuntu
06:00	<feryana>	yep
06:00	<NytShade>	Anyone willing to help me out with a samba woe?
06:00	<|Sivik|>	RemyLaptop, its eastist to install windows and then install ubuntu: the ubuntu grub will find the windows partition
06:00	<amphi>	mikebot: just a frame?
06:01	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, whast the problem
06:01	<feryana>	i want to make a deb or something installable
06:01	<mikebot>	amphi, yeah
06:01	<Managu>	Apostle^: fair enough, also not particularly relivant to our discussion ;-)
06:01	<RemyLaptop>	!grub
06:01	<ubotu>	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
06:01	<amphi>	mikebot: use the x11 driver
06:01	<linux_newbie2>	Apostle: at this point I just want to get back to windows before I give Ubuntu another shot
06:01	<RemyLaptop>	thanks |Sivik|
06:01	<amphi>	mikebot: and then whatever you like, gimp for example
06:01	<Jeff1983>	i purchased some tv shows on dvd. i'd like to rip the commentary tracks only (i.e. no video) is there a way to do this?
06:01	<carthik>	feryana, the question is, why are you doing that? isn't what you need in the ubuntu repositories?
06:01	<mikebot>	amphi, someone told me to do "mplayer -vo x11", but i don't know whatto doa fter that
06:01	<vars>	feryana, dpkg -i yourdebher.deb
06:01	<Apostle^>	Managu, i tell you this because if the person were to install lilo and then updated their kernel they would not have a working system
06:01	<NytShade>	I've installed it and SWAT, but when I log into swat it doesn't give me any configuration options. As though I'm a guest.
06:01	<amphi>	mikebot: yes, that's what I'm saying
06:01	<feryana>	is a software unmounted on tar.gaz and i want to run that software
06:01	<Mr>	Hey there
06:01	<RemyLaptop>	another question, I've plugged in an external HDD, and it's recognised it, but as read only... how can I make it so I can write to it ?
06:02	<mikebot>	amphi, but when i type that, it just gives me a list of commands...then what do i do?
06:02	<carthik>	feryana, what software is that?
06:02	<atoponce>	Mr: try the vesa driver, althogh you won't be able to do anything graphic intensive
06:02	<feryana>	ooodi-0.68-i686-linux.tar.gz
06:02	<amphi>	mikebot: mplayer -vo x11 whatever
06:02	<feryana>	is a installed for dictionaries for open office
06:02	<Managu>	Apostle^: indeed, I'm somewhat familiar with the difference
06:02	<Mr>	how would i do that
06:02	<feryana>	i've downloaded like that
06:02	<amphi>	feryana: is there not a package for that?
06:02	<mikebot>	amphi, i understand typing "mplayer -vo x11" in terminal...but now how do i get the screen i want into a jpg?
06:02	<feryana>	nop... just that file
06:02	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: lemme see.  Is there an /etc/lilo.conf on your current system?
06:03	<Dr_Willis>	NytShade,  the ubuntu packagtes proberly have it 'locked down' for security reasons - check the wiki/forums for what needs to be done to reenable full use of it.
06:03	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, can you help?
06:03	<tagabasak_>	dli,  yey got it now, i just have to edit my menu.lst  t_T
06:03	<atoponce>	'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
06:03	<feryana>	I just what to install some spelling dictionaries for open office
06:03	<dli>	tagabasak_, update-grub
06:03	<feryana>	and I just finded that
06:03	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, thank you. I'll look again.
06:03	<vars>	!pastebin
06:03	<ubotu>	[pastebin]  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/, a site for pasting long texts so you don't disrupt the channel - or install webboard in Gnome: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269
06:03	<amphi>	mikebot: capture it with what ever you like, gimp, xwd | xwdtopnm | pnmtopng >	foo.png, there are many
06:04	<feryana>	i've installed the build-essential
06:04	<feryana>	but i can't do more
06:04	<mikebot>	amphi, how in gimp..that's what i'm asking
06:04	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: yes
06:04	<amphi>	feryana: are the dictionaries not packaged?
06:04	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: oh, good.  Can you pastebin a copy for me ot look at?
06:04	<amphi>	mikebot: ffs, file->aquire IIRC
06:05	<feryana>	at least i don't find them
06:05	<feryana>	i just finded that one
06:05	<mathieu_>	is it a holiday in the US tomorrow ?
06:05	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, is there a better way to serve files to windows pcs over the network?
06:05	<Managu>	mathieu_: nope
06:05	<kbrosnan>	no
06:05	<atoponce>	mathieu_: not that i know of
06:05	<Managu>	mathieu_: monday week
06:05	<mikebot>	amphi thank you
06:05	<tagabasak_>	dli,why im on Busybox
06:05	<kbrosnan>	the monday after that
06:05	<Managu>	mathieu_: monday week is when Memorial Day is observed in the US
06:05	<amphi>	Managu: what is remembered?
06:06	<kbrosnan>	29th of May
06:06	<feryana>	the veterans amphi
06:06	<tagabasak_>	dli,it stops loading and promptind BusyBox
06:06	<amphi>	feryana: ah
06:06	<Managu>	amphi: That's a good question.  Like an idiot, I don't know the history of Memorial Day
06:06	<vars>	yeah that is when will celebrate that we won the war
06:07	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, not really
06:07	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: uh, having some kind of clipboard issue, it won't paste into the box :P
06:07	<|Sivik|>	mathieu, no
06:07	<feryana>	so then, there is no way to install or pack a tar.gz file?
06:07	<|Sivik|>	mathieu, its next monday we have a holiday
06:07	<amphi>	feryana: tar zxvf foo.tgz
06:07	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: nm
06:07	<RemyLaptop>	another question, I've plugged in an external HDD, and it's recognised it, but as read only... how can I make it so I can write to it ?
06:07	<ray_>	i have a radeon 7200 and i'm trying to get my monitor to display on tv? any help?
06:07	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: heh
06:07	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, are you trying to get files from a windows box to a linux box?
06:07	<MorbidHunger>	for somereason its not mounted
06:07	<MorbidHunger>	i shall intalld daemon tools
06:07	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14433
06:08	<|Sivik|>	ray_: have fun, ati is a bitch in linux
06:08	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: Edit->Paste didn't work, but middle-click does...ok...
06:08	<ray_>	boy oh boy
06:08	<ray_>	not too good to hear...
06:08	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: sec, reading
06:08	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, I'm setting up this ubuntu box as a testbed and a fileserver. I'd like to get it working as a fileserver before the end of the night :)
06:08	<feryana>	and what I must do with the files?
06:09	<feryana>	there is one oooodi.install
06:09	<feryana>	and others
06:09	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, so your trying to access the files from the ubuntu box to the windows box?
06:09	<tagabasak_>	dli, i got an alert it says that /dev/hdc2 doesnt exist. dorping to a shell
06:09	<amphi>	ray_: OTOH, that's an old card, so it should be well supported - radeontool might be of use to you
06:09	<ray_>	radeontool?
06:09	<feryana>	what I do with that?
06:09	<amphi>	ray_: radeontool
06:09	<dli>	tagabasak_, it's /dev/hda2
06:09	<ray_>	a channel?
06:10	<tagabasak_>	dli, what shoul i do?
06:10	<pppoe_dude>	how can i change vncserver's default window manager? i.e. switch from gnome to kde
06:10	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, and vice versa.
06:10	<amphi>	ray_: no, a program - it's packaged; apt-cache show radeontool
06:10	<dli>	tagabasak_, you can type 'e' to edit grub entries
06:10	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: add to the end 2 lines: "other=/dev/hda1" and "label=windows"
06:11	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, to get files off of the ubuntu box, use a scp program in windows
06:11	<amphi>	ray_: actually, it has nothing to do with tv out, sorry ;)
06:11	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: then run "lilo" as root
06:11	<ray_>	heh, ok then
06:11	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: I believe my windows is on hda2
06:11	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: oh?  What's on hda1?
06:11	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, and in ubuntu, make sure the windows firewall is off and then you should be able to use samba
06:11	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: I think GRUB lived there?  It's a small partition
06:11	<tagabasak_>	dli,it stops loading, i cant login to gui.. becaus of the alerts. im on a shell now.
06:12	<amphi>	ray_: atitvout might be useful
06:12	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: you can run "fdisk -l" to be sure who's what, but if windows is on /dev/hda2, that's what you want in the "other" field
06:12	<dli>	tagabasak_, reboot, change in grub
06:12	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, not using any firewall software on any of the pc's in the home's network.
06:12	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, yes, but is the normal windows firewall on?
06:12	<amphi>	ray_: that's what I was thinking of
06:12	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, No
06:12	<MorbidHunger>	u guys know how to unrar something
06:12	<ray_>	thanks, amphi
06:12	<kelvie>	where are the ipw2200 drivers located
06:13	<tagabasak_>	dli, how could i do that?
06:13	<DBO>	!tell MorbidHunger about rar
06:13	<KaosX>	windows fw only blocks/monitors incoming connections
06:13	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, thats weird
06:13	<amphi>	kelvie: ipw2200.sf.net
06:13	<ray_>	here's a simple question hopefully
06:13	<kelvie>	are they not in synaptic?
06:13	<dli>	tagabasak_, boot livecd
06:13	<feryana>	amphi what I must do with the files inside ?
06:13	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: yeah, windows is on hda2
06:13	<amphi>	feryana: I have no idea
06:13	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, how so? I shut it off ages ago.
06:13	<|Sivik|>	KaosX, yes i know that, but hes trying to access the windows files from samba on the ubuntu box
06:13	<tagabasak_>	dli,ok T_T
06:13	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, i didn't say it was on
06:13	<ray_>	how do I keep my second hard drive (hdb1) mounted each time i reboot
06:13	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, i just asked if it was on
06:13	<amphi>	kelvie: they're in the install IIRC - modprobe ipw2200 should work
06:14	<DBO>	ray_, you have to put an entry in /etc/fstab
06:14	<Rug>	ray_: edit /etc/fstab
06:14	<amphi>	ray_: stick it in fstab
06:14	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, when you run samba, it should see the mshome network
06:14	<Rug>	=) damn beat me to it
06:14	<DBO>	Rug, i love you too
06:14	<raven>	does anyone know if gentoo or actually kororaa have a synaptic type package system to install packages?
06:14	<Rug>	DBO: but atleast we are better then amphi
06:14	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: bit after my bedtime here, so I'm gonna be going shortly
06:14	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, or whatever you currently have it named as long as your have the same network address and the same subnet mask for both computers
06:14	<ojai>	anyone know of any problems or issues running Dapper on an Opteron?
06:14	<amphi>	Rug: much ;) but then I'm on rural dialup
06:15	<|Sivik|>	ojai: go to #ubuntu+1
06:15	<Rug>	nice excuse.
06:15	<|Sivik|>	ojai: thats the dapper help channel
06:15	<|Sivik|>	!dapper
06:15	<ubotu>	**** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
06:15	<HymnToLife>	amphi>	join the club :)
06:15	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: /proc/misc: No entry for device-mapper found
06:15	<ojai>	Sivik: Yeah, already asked there -- not much feedback :)
06:15	<amphi>	Rug: excuse, perhaps, but hardly 'nice'
06:15	<Rug>	I have never heard of dialup lag affecting IRC
06:15	<amphi>	HymnToLife: ;)
06:15	<MorbidHunger>	still having trouble mounting
06:15	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: /dev/mapper/control: open failed: No suck device
06:15	<amphi>	Rug: it does if you do anything else
06:15	<linux_newbie2>	*such
06:15	<disinterseted_pe>	so exactly what do i need to do to play windows media on ubuntu?
06:16	<Blue89>	lol
06:16	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: Warning: '/proc/partitions' does nto match '/dev' directory structure
06:16	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: what's at the end?
06:16	<ray_>	now, just to be sure... it should be /dev/hdb1 and not /dev/hdb?
06:16	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, they are both on the same workgroup and subnet.
06:16	<RemyLaptop>	does anybody have any ideas ?
06:17	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: Fatal: Trying to map files from unnamed device 0x000e (NFS/RAID mirror down?)
06:17	<Rug>	ray_: yes
06:17	<ray_>	thanks, rug
06:17	<ray_>	you guys are awesome
06:17	<Rug>	Take that back!
06:17	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: ok, well, seems that didn't work.  And I'm out of ideas.  Got that backup of your windows partition handy?
06:17	<amphi>	Rug: heh, I still have an old motorola 14.4 pcmcia modem somewhere
06:17	<Rug>	I am not!!!!
06:17	<ray_>	ha
06:17	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: oy
06:18	<whereeee>	hi
06:18	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, just because they have the same subnet doesn't mean they are on the same network
06:18	<Rug>	amphi: My first modem was a 300/1200 Switchable MANUAL "Pocket Modem" for the C64
06:18	<whereeee>	where can I get a spanish dictionary for openoffice
06:18	<Rug>	I ran a BBS on that thing
06:18	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, you have to verify that the network portion of the ip address's are the same
06:18	<|Sivik|>	like the same probably first 3 parts of the ip address
06:19	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, are you using a external ip and an internal ip?
06:19	<mugzie>	grr im so confused
06:19	<rak_>	does ubuntu only support 1024X768 or is my graphics card not installed properly?
06:19	<amphi>	Rug: manual? acoustic coupler? ;)
06:19	<|Sivik|>	rak_: you probably dont' have it install correctly
06:19	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: would the window bootloader be having issues because the windows parition is not first?
06:19	<Rug>	You would dial the number with the telephone in your hand, and when the other end picked up, you switched on the modem and entered ATA+ in the term
06:19	<|Sivik|>	linux_newbie2, shouldn't
06:19	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: the things we've tried have kept running into the fact that linux doesn't know the mapping from bios drive numbers to logical drive numbers.  Solving that might help.  You might also try using cfdisk to make sure that the windows partition is set "active" or "Bootable", or something
06:19	<Rug>	amphi: not quite that bad, but VERY close!
06:19	<amphi>	heh
06:19	<MorbidHunger>	is there any other way to mount cd images?
06:19	<tagabasak_>	dli, what should i do now?
06:20	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: ah, it is not!
06:20	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: mount -o loop -t iso9660 foo.iso /mount/point
06:20	<Rug>	ray_: yes it does support it.
06:20	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: the linux partition is set as boot
06:20	<whereeee>	Where can I download a spanish dictionary for openoffice????????????
06:20	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, they are both using addresses assigned by the router's DHCP service.
06:20	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, can you repost the url for your current soucres.list
06:20	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: should be an easy fix
06:20	<MorbidHunger>	thats not working
06:20	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, then they should be on the same network
06:20	<dli>	tagabasak_, correct your /etc/fstab /boot/grub/menu.lst on hdd
06:20	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, are you running the GUI for samba?
06:20	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: should I unmark the Linux partition as bootable as well?
06:20	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	http://fkraiem.no-ip.org/stuff/sources.list
06:21	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, there is a gui?
06:21	<Rug>	ray_: edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and input the resolutions you want.
06:21	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: yup.  Though I don't think you can have 2 bootable partitions (I could well be wrong)
06:21	<ray_>	rug, i almost missed that.
06:21	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: that is the way to do it; perhaps the image is corrupt? what does 'file whatever.iso' say?
06:21	<tagabasak_>	dli,do i have to mount again?
06:21	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, are you trying ti run samba in command line?
06:21	<pppoe_dude>	how can i start a vnc session with kde as a wm instead of gnome
06:21	<ray_>	atitvout supports radeon 7200?
06:21	<nathansnook>	It seems that ubuntu is a little slow is there any way to speed this system up?
06:21	<dli>	tagabasak_, yes
06:21	<KaosX>	thats why its easier to tie samba to an interface rather than a network
06:21	<NytShade>	I belive so, yes.
06:21	<amphi>	ray_: maybe ;)
06:21	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, I belive so, yes.
06:21	<Managu>	nathansnook: define slow.  (slow, how?).  There might be a way to address your issue
06:21	<ray_>	okay, i'm about to install it
06:21	<MorbidHunger>	sage: mount -V                 : print version
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount -h                 : print this help
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount                    : list mounted filesystems
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount -l                 : idem, including volume labels
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	So far the informational part. Next the mounting.
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	The command is `mount [-t fstype]  something somewhere'.
06:22	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, thats the hard way to do it
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	Details found in /etc/fstab may be omitted.
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount -a [-t|-O]  ...     : mount all stuff from /etc/fstab
06:22	<ray_>	how do i run it once it's installed?
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount device             : mount device at the known place
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount directory          : mount known device here
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount -t type dev dir    : ordinary mount command
06:22	<nathansnook>	The Gnome X GUI interface
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	Note that one does not really mount a device, one mounts
06:22	<Managu>	!tell morbidhunger about paste
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	a filesystem (of the given type) found on the device.
06:22	<Rug>	!paste
06:22	<ubotu>	Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	One can also mount an already visible directory tree elsewhere:
06:22	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: Wrote partition table, but re-read table failed.  Reboot to update table.  Toggle bootable flag of the current partition.
06:22	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, easy way being?
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount --bind olddir newdir
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	or move a subtree:
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	       mount --move olddir newdir
06:22	<nathansnook>	Also firefox is a little slow.
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	A device can be given by name, say /dev/hda1 or /dev/cdrom,
06:22	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, kde or gnome?
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	or by label, using  -L label  or by uuid, using  -U uuid .
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	Other options: [-nfFrsvw]  [-o options]  [-p passwdfd] .
06:22	<amphi>	ray_: the manpage says "atitvout - ATI Rage/Radeon TV Out configuration program"
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	For many more details, say  man 8 mount
06:22	<whereeee>	Where can I download a spanish dictionary for openoffice????? Please!!!!!
06:22	<Managu>	linux_newbie: worth a shot
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	thats what it says
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	id burn it, but i have no cdrs
06:22	<Rug>	MorbidHunger: Stop flodding the channel!
06:22	<Apostle^>	i have a removeable drive that keeps getting mounted read only, what can i do
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	ok ok
06:22	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, um default...
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	someone asked a question
06:22	<MorbidHunger>	i answered
06:22	<nathansnook>	I have just had ubuntu 5.10 for about a day or two and my girlfriend says it slower than fedora core
06:22	<cr1mson>	Where can I get the original sources.list for Ubuntu Dapper Beta?  I seemed to have messed mine up.

06:23	<linux_newbie2>	ok
06:23	<Managu>	linux_newbie2: don't forget to remove the CD, or properly change your bios, etc
06:23	<amphi>	MorbidHunger: perhaps you didn't specify an existing directory as a mount point?
06:23	<duco>	Hoy how can i get skype downloaded even when i dont have  windos
06:23	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, if you go to places and then network servers, you should be able to see the mshome thingy
06:23	<amphi>	ray_: man atitvout (assuming you installed it)
06:23	<KaosX>	duco: there is a linux build of skype
=== Smokeh is now known as NoCrown

06:24	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, you should be able to see it there
06:24	<Managu>	nathansnook: ahh.  A pissing contest then?  I'd definitely let my girlfriend win, no contest, if I were in that situation.
06:24	<whereeee>	ok thks!!!
06:24	<Managu>	nathansnook: ahh.  A pissing contest then?  I'd definitely let my girlfriend win, no contest, if I were in that situation.
06:24	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, a password diologue box has poped up.
06:24	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, ok
06:24	<nathansnook>	Is there a package like Rpm for ubuntu?
06:24	<duco>	yes idid download it
06:24	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, it's not accepting my user and password.
06:24	<Managu>	nathansnook: ubuntu uses the apt-get/dpkg (.deb) package management system
06:24	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, then go into windows and edit is so you don't have to ask for password when loging in to the windows box
06:25	<tagabasak_>	dli, i dont have /etc/fstab
06:25	<KaosX>	nathanshook: debs are the ones use in ubuntu...you can convert RPMS with the alien commnad
06:25	<MorbidHunger>	i tried to mount it to mt home folder
06:25	<KaosX>	most people use apt-get though
06:25	<Rug>	tagabasak_: yes you do, you MUST have it
06:25	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, i'm not sure how to fix that, never had the problem with user and password for samba
06:25	<tagabasak_>	rug, sorry got it now
06:25	<NytShade>	I'm not logging into the wondows box.
06:25	<Apostle^>	i have a removeable drive that keeps getting mounted read only, what can i do
06:25	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, what do you mean your not loggint to the windows box
06:25	<KaosX>	NytShade: you have to add the user to samba
06:25	<nathansnook>	Firefox 1.5 is that supported with apt get or not quite yet?
06:26	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, all I did was open the Network Servers "place"
06:26	<Managu>	nathansnook: not quite yet
06:26	<GTroy>	nathahsnook, I don't belive you can apt get it yet
06:26	<GTroy>	!firefox1.5
06:26	<ubotu>	You can use firefox 1.5 by following this wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FirefoxNewVersion
06:26	<tagabasak_>	dli, how can i correct my /etc/fstab?
06:26	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, then thats same password as your sudo su password
06:26	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, is that the window that pops up?
06:26	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, I've entered my username and sudo pass. It's not accepting.
06:27	<|Sivik|>	NytShade, or does that happen when you click on the Windows Network icon?
06:27	<Apostle^>	i have a removeable drive that keeps getting mounted read only, what can i do
06:27	<MorbidHunger>	enter your pass the sudo password
06:27	<|Sivik|>	Apostle^, mount it as root
06:27	<Apostle^>	|Sivik|, k
06:27	<NytShade>	|Sivik|, It happened as soon as I opend the "Network Servers" place.
06:27	<tagabasak_>	ls
06:27	<Apostle^>	|Sivik|, but it's mounted automatically
06:28	<|Sivik|>	Apostle^, uh, you can unmount it in terminal and then remount it
06:28	<|Sivik|>	Apostle^, its just permission issues
06:28	<duco>	Hoy how can i get skype downloaded even when i dont have  windos  but ihave linux and java  but iget skype but ikant get it working
06:28	<Apostle^>	|Sivik|, when i try to remount it it says no entry in fstab, because i don't have one
06:28	<clever>	how do i get a dialup modem to work on ubuntu?
06:28	<Managu>	duco: is English your first language?
06:28	<GTroy>	duco, sudo apt-get install skype
06:28	<amphi>	clever: a real one/
06:28	<|Sivik|>	Apostle^, the device should be /dev/sda1 unless you have a sata hd
06:28	<amphi>	?
06:29	<KaosX>	duco: what cant you get working
06:29	<HymnToLife>	duco>	you can download a DEB from Skype's website
06:29	<Apostle^>	|Sivik|, it's /dev/sda2
06:29	<|Sivik|>	Apostle^, ok, then all you should have to do is "mount /dev/sda2 /place/youwantitmounted
06:30	<Apostle^>	|Sivik|, then i have to use sudo to do anything
06:30	<linux_newbie2>	Managu: it worked! Thank you thank you thank you!
06:30	<nightshade>	what up ppl

06:33	<clever_>	didnt even ask which partitions to use so if i hadnt allready backed my stuff up it would have probly whiped my old os's
06:33	<GTroy>	ray_ you have to find the way to open bios when you start

06:33	<clever_>	i was using redhat9
06:33	<GTroy>	HymnToLIfe, why slack?
06:33	<clever_>	wanted to have a look at ubuntu

06:35	<GTroy>	clever_good to know, I'm a desktop user
06:35	<KaosX>	i still like ubuntu much better than RH derivitives

06:39	<amphi>	clever_: that'd be trivial to setup
06:39	<rob138>	Rug, but the thing is i need the environment to be drawn sideways so to speak
06:39	<clever_>	the external modem isnt being auto detected by the network admin prog
06:39	<KaosX>	rob138: display options under preferences doesnt give that option?
06:39	<Rug>	rob138: so you want to be able to "flip" the screen?
06:39	<amphi>	clever_: just tell whatever you use to dial to use /dev/ttySwhatever
06:39	<dli>	clever_,  can you try wvdial
06:40	<rob138>	Rug, yes, KaosX, nope
06:40	<clever_>	i dont know which ttssX to use
06:40	<clever_>	and i didnt try wvdial yet
06:40	<amphi>	rob138: xrandr can rotate the display
06:40	<HymnToLife>	clever_>	wvdialconf might tell you
06:40	<clever_>	allready spent 20 hours trying to get that to work on the winmodem before i knew it was a winmodem
06:40	<dli>	clever, try it, " wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf "
06:40	<dli>	clever, try it, " sudo wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf "
06:40	<rob138>	amphi, do i need a lot of arguments ? or is there like -r for rotate
06:40	<HymnToLife>	with sudo
06:40	<clever_>	scaning
06:40	<clever_>	allready did sudo su -
06:40	<KaosX>	clever_: i feel that way with linux and my ibook (airport extreme)
06:40	<amphi>	clever_: or use minicom, and throw atz at dev/ttyS[1..n]  until you get 'ok'
06:41	<clever_>	gives me a root term without setting a pass
06:41	<amphi>	rob138: man xrandr has the details
06:41	<clever_>	the modem lights flashed
06:41	<rob138>	alright
06:41	<clever_>	looks like it worked:)
06:41	<hawkeey>	where can I find information about ubuntu packages?
06:41	<HymnToLife>	clever_ >	use sudo -i instead, sudo su can wreck up your permissions
06:41	<KaosX>	know what else about a sudo su - term....theres no .bash_history saved either
06:41	<hawkeey>	I am interested in ipw3945

06:41	<Rug>	ahh
06:41	<clever_>	how can it wreck the perms HymnToLife ?
06:42	<clever_>	end up making files owned by what you where before the sudo?

06:42	<HymnToLife>	clever_ >	I trust the folks who told me so and are far more knowledgeable than me
06:42	<clever_>	ahh
06:42	<rob138>	amphi, the only options it allows for are under (342mmx271mm) not the other way around
06:42	<clever_>	i find it doesnt set $home right
06:42	<clever_>	so i end up in my old home dir and other random things
06:43	<rob138>	amphi, and the only rotations possible are "normal"
06:43	<KaosX>	some people say its because youre using your password to launch a root shell...somethings dont auth correctly...sometimes end up with no owner

06:43	<Sivik-homework>	!ftp
06:43	<ubotu>	FTP clients: gftp, konqueror, kbear, nautilus. FTP servers: vsftpd, proftpd
06:43	<Sivik-homework>	nvm
06:44	<hawkeey>	Rug: I wanted to know how the package worked and if it is available for install
06:44	<rob138>	how do i configure my monitor?
06:44	<JohnDanger>	what should my fstab entry look like so an ipod can be written, umask= ?
06:44	<PyroMithrandir>	I use proftpd, but I don't really like it ;)
06:44	<hawkeey>	amphi: umm... so is it in dapper drake or not?
06:44	<amphi>	rob138: you're SOL if only normal is allowed, AFAIK
06:44	<HymnToLife>	I use VSFTPd and it rocks
06:44	<amphi>	hawkeey: no idea - ask in #ubuntu+1 perhaps
06:44	<KaosX>	ive used vsftpd for a while
06:44	<KaosX>	thats what we used in school too
06:44	<rob138>	amphi, is that monitor side or graphics card side?
06:45	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	002
06:45	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, thanks
06:45	<amphi>	rob138: not sure, the card I would have thought (or rather the driver)
06:46	<Rug>	poll time:  what do you prefer to use  Katapult or a "Run Command Line" to launch programs in your GUI
06:46	<rob138>	amphi, guessing so cuz i have ati
=== Klowner_ is now known as Klowner
06:46	<amphi>	Rug: I have a keybinding to launch grun
06:46	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i still cant write to it man..
06:46	<clever_>	Rug: i perfer a gnome-terminal open 24/7 and use bash's & to bg stuff
06:46	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, ok, when i run vsftpd, how do i set up a user?
06:46	<Rug>	all very nice answers...
06:47	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	please pastebin your fstab
06:47	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i think it's because /media/ipod belongs to root.. but i can't chown it
06:47	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, how do i set up a user for vsftpd?
06:47	<Flannel>	rob138: what card do you have?
06:47	<HymnToLife>	Sivik-homework>	just add a user to your system
06:47	<clever_>	Rug: using a term window lets me use tab completion and lets me watch the output of them without needed extra term windows for each
06:47	<HymnToLife>	FTP is just another way to login
06:47	<rob138>	flannel Radeon X800XT
06:48	<Flannel>	rob138: ATI? or NV? or somethign eles?
06:48	<rob138>	flannel ATI
06:48	<Taru>	How do I find out the root password?
06:48	<HymnToLife>	!tell Taru about rot
06:48	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, its already in the system
06:48	<HymnToLife>	!tell Taru about root
06:48	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, its the current user i'm loged in with
06:48	<Rug>	clever_: you might want to consider switching to aterm, it'll cut down on memory usage.
06:48	<Samuli^>	Taru, you don't have one as a default
06:48	<Taru>	I am trying to install the Linux (self-extracting) file
06:49	<Sivik-homework>	when i connect via gftp, it says only anoymous is allowed to connect
06:49	<clever_>	i keep a single multi tabed gnome-terminal window open
06:49	<Taru>	I typed "Su".
06:49	<HymnToLife>	Sivik-homework>	you need to allow_local_users, check man vsftpd.conf
06:49	<Taru>	It's asking for root password.
06:49	<clever_>	and often a xterm for stuff that needs a fast term
06:49	<Sivik-homework>	ok
06:49	<Samuli^>	Taru, it's the password of first user.
06:49	<Taru>	Samuli^, o.O
06:49	<ZeZu>	what is the applications name that comes with nv-glx, it generates its own xorg.conf file ?
06:49	<JohnDanger>	!paste
06:49	<ubotu>	Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
06:49	<Sivik-homework>	where is the vsftp.conf?
06:49	<clever_>	locate vsftp.conf
06:49	<HymnToLife>	Sivik-homework>	in /etc just like every other config file
06:50	<clever_>	probly at /etc/vsftp.conf
06:50	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, ok
06:50	<GTroy>	guess that was to hymntolife danger
06:50	<Taru>	Samuli^, I am first user, aren't I?
06:50	<Flannel>	rob138: hmm, its rather easy in nvidia, I dont see anything about ATI though.
06:50	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14435
06:50	<Samuli^>	Taru, probably.
06:50	<hawkeey>	is there some place where I can search for ubuntu packages?
06:50	<Taru>	Samuli^, I typed my own password that didn't work hmm.
06:50	<disinterseted_pe>	how do i enter a yahoo chat room through gaim
06:50	<Sivik-homework>	apt-cache search "packagename"
06:50	<rob138>	flannel, where are you looking?
06:50	<Sivik-homework>	without the ""
06:50	<Samuli^>	Taru, Hmm, I don't know. Use sudo instead of su?
06:50	<hawkeey>	I don't have ubuntu installed
06:50	<Taru>	Samuli^, Ok, thanks^^
06:50	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	try adding rw, to your mount parameters
06:50	<clever_>	that works Samuli^
06:51	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, where
06:51	<ZeZu>	anyone?
06:51	<hawkeey>	I am trying to see where a particular package is located before I do an install
06:51	<hawkeey>	is there a website like packages.debian.org
06:51	<ZeZu>	installing nvidia-glx doesn't change the driver itself, i know where to change that but i want to setup dual head and such
06:51	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	wherever you want, at the beginning for ex, so it would lok loke rw,sync,user,noauto,umask=002
06:51	<ZeZu>	the main installer on the nv site doesn't see my linux source files for some reason
06:52	<ZeZu>	so it can't build it
06:52	<disinterseted_pe>	does anyone use yahoo in gaim?
06:52	<Taru>	Samuli^, Sudo brings me to some wierd command.
06:52	<clever_>	i use yahoo in gaim but not for chat rooms
06:52	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i think the problem is the owner is 'steven' but i'm 'pete'
06:52	<Samuli^>	Taru, what do you mean?
06:52	<clever_>	Taru: sudo -i
06:52	<Rug>	irssi for IRC
06:52	<babo>	I'm downloading clip art from the M$ office website, but instead of the art being saved on my computer. I get .mpf xml files instead ? ... what's going on ?
06:52	<clever_>	to get a term window
06:52	<pycs>	<disinterseted_pe>	in the tools menu there is room list
06:52	<clever_>	as root
06:52	<Taru>	Samuli^, I am trying to install Java (current version), so that I can run Frostwire smoothly.
06:53	<Flannel>	rob138: well, NV can do it with the video card, to get it to work with ATI (or anything else) you might need to use RANDR (Resize and Rotate, basically a screen utility) to get it to work.
06:53	<disinterseted_pe>	johndanger do u have any idea how u get into room in yahoo through gaim?
06:53	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	then set uid=your_uid
06:53	<Taru>	Samuli^, I have Frostwire installed, but needs working Java.
06:53	<HymnToLife>	same for gid=your_gid
06:53	<disinterseted_pe>	ok ty pycs
06:53	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, HymnToLife can you show me an example
06:53	<Flannel>	Taru: why not just get it from the repository?
06:53	<JohnDanger>	disinterseted_pe, no i don't
06:53	<Taru>	Samuli^, I installed the default Java, but that seems not good enough.
06:53	<Samuli^>	Taru, o-kay. So you have a deb-package for java? "Sudo dpkg -i package.deb"
06:53	<Taru>	Flannel, How?
06:53	<vars>	hey i got a error and ubuntu wouldn't install grub but it lilo worked.   lilo sucks how can i install grub?
06:53	<Taru>	Flannel, I just started using Ubuntu today, I am a very much new.
06:53	<rob138>	flannel, randr only gives options for different resolutions, and even when i changed them in randr, none of my windows adapt, just the veiw i have
06:53	<GTroy>	taru, open synaptic package manager
06:54	<Samuli^>	Flannel, I don't think sun's java is available for breezy.
06:54	<rob138>	flannel, kinda like zooming
06:54	<Taru>	Samuli^, I did, but getting it again.
06:54	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, i changed the vstfpd.conf but it still says that anoyomous is the only way to login
06:54	<GTroy>	Flannel, I'll help taru
06:54	<Taru>	GTroy, Ok.
06:54	<Flannel>	Samuli^: yeah it is.  It's in the repositories ;)
06:54	<HymnToLife>	Sivik-homework>	the option is in there, check the manpage
06:54	<Samuli^>	Flannel, Okay. Cool. I thought it was just for Dapper.
06:54	<vars>	please help me
06:54	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14436
06:54	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, thanks
06:54	<Flannel>	Samuli^: nah, it's been retroactively put into Breezy.  I was unsure for a while too.
06:55	<Samuli^>	Taru, so type sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre then.
06:55	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.og/14437
06:55	<Flannel>	rob138: RANDR should work for an entire X, I dont know what sorts of config you'll need though
06:55	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, thats what my vsftpd.conf file looks like
06:55	<HymnToLife>	Sivik-homework>	wanna have a look at mine ?
06:55	<Samuli^>	taru, you need to have multiverse or universe in the repos though.
06:55	<Taru>	Says "You must run this program as root user"
06:56	<rob138>	flannel, eh, too complicated and difficult for something hardly neccessary, thanks
06:56	<Taru>	Samuli^, Ok
06:56	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, i changed the anonymoung_enable=NO and i changed my local_enable=YES
06:56	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, sure
06:56	<GTroy>	taru, don't type synaptic in terminal
06:56	<Flannel>	Samuli^: sun-j2sdk1.5 for breezy
06:56	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, so mine is 1002 i think?
06:56	<Samuli^>	Taru, what Flannel just said.
06:56	<GTroy>	open it from system-->administration-->synaptic
06:57	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, please let me see your vsftpd.conf file
06:57	<disinterseted_pe>	pycs i get the same thing trying to join any rooms in yahoo maybe the room is full is there not any way to get in them any settings?
06:57	<Taru>	How do i go about with multiverse or universe in repos?
06:57	<HymnToLife>	Sivik-homework>	http://fkraiem.no-ip.org/stuff/vsftpd.conf
06:57	<GTroy>	taru, I'll show you
06:57	<Taru>	GTroy, Ok!
06:57	<Sivik-homework>	GTroy, or the person can do sudo synaptic to get it in root moe
06:57	<GTroy>	have you got synaptic open
06:58	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i still can't write to the ipod' still says owner 'steven'
06:58	<Taru>	Where is it?
06:58	<GTroy>	sivik-homework, true but it's easier to start with gui operations
06:58	<Samuli^>	Flannel, though.. isn't sdk the developer version and jre just runtime-enviroment?
06:58	<amphi>	rob138: any success?
06:58	<Samuli^>	Flannel, sdk is going to get you packages you don't actually need if you're not coding in java.
06:58	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	are you sure you set the right uid and then remount the device ?
06:58	<GTroy>	taru, look up to my post
06:58	<rob138>	amphi, nope, i don't think it's possible with my graphics card driver for ATI
06:58	<Flannel>	Samuli^: right, but that's all you get.  sdk includes the jre.
06:59	<pycs>	disinterseted_pe, i get the same thing too in gyach enhanced, but maybe the room is full for now, you can log in later :)
06:59	<Samuli^>	Flannel, true. I don't know if the size difference is much.
06:59	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, yea, my UID is 1002 same with gid i got them from users & groups ... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14438
06:59	<Taru>	GTroy, cool, thanks^^
06:59	<Flannel>	Samuli^: they just lumped the entire java thing into the package for breezy.  piecewise is dapper only.
06:59	<vars>	is there a way to install the 2.4 kernal
06:59	<Flannel>	vars: sure, use apt.
06:59	<disinterseted_pe>	ok i didnt think there was anything that could be done ty pycs
07:00	<vars>	ok
07:00	<Sivik-homework>	HymnToLife, now its telling me that the ip connection refused
07:00	<GTroy>	flannel: hahha easy anser
07:00	<rob138>	amphi, xranr info: Rotations possible - normal
07:00	<amphi>	rob138: yeah, I've been futzing with it, no success yet
07:01	<CaptainMorgan>	omg.. amarok is so buggy..
07:01	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	did you remount your device ?
07:01	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, yes
07:01	<GTroy>	captainmorgan, the new version?
07:01	<GTroy>	hey lilo
07:01	<CaptainMorgan>	!amarok
07:01	<ubotu>	[amarok]  a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/
07:02	<CaptainMorgan>	shoot... I gotta get 1.4
07:02	<Flannel>	rob138: actually, I think it's completely impossible.  actually.
07:02	<CaptainMorgan>	I still have 1.3.7
07:02	<GTroy>	capt, there you go
07:02	<CaptainMorgan>	how do I update it?
07:02	<rob138>	flannel, really?
07:03	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, you probably need to compile it from the source.
07:03	<Flannel>	rob138: maybe for breezy, but as of 10-10 last year, the proprietary ATI driver didnt support rotation.
07:03	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i can't figure this out
07:03	<B1zz>	CaptainMorgan yeah 1.4 is nice :) but still has some bugs...
07:03	<HymnToLife>	CaptainMorgan>	amarok 1.6 packages are on separate repos, see kubuntu.org
07:03	<GTroy>	captainmorgan, use synaptic to remove amarok, than compile the new one
07:03	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i tried with user 'steven' but it still says readd only file system
07:03	<Flannel>	rob138: erm, maybe in dapper you'll be able to.  might have a newer fgrlx (or whatever it) is driver
07:03	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, though check first if there's ubuntu-deb package, or even better repository available.
07:03	<B1zz>	there is a v1.6?

07:17	<GTroy>	taru, java is a little different
07:17	<disinterseted_pe>	vars i dont know where console is
07:17	<Flannel>	IMPOSSIBLE: why dont you get it from apt?
07:17	<rob138>	why would someone use Vmware to run linux on linux?
07:17	<IMPOSSIBLE>	i've put the two files there
07:17	<Taru>	GTroy, Or check everything here and update?
07:17	<IMPOSSIBLE>	apt?
07:18	<Flannel>	IMPOSSIBLE: synaptic?
07:18	<GTroy>	taru, sure
07:18	<Taru>	GTroy, ok
07:18	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	try reformatting your ipod
07:18	<HymnToLife>	from Windows
07:18	<IMPOSSIBLE>	i tried that at the beggening
07:18	<amphi>	rob138: couldn't get it to work here :(
07:18	<vars>	disinterseted_pe, go to the applications an look for terminal
07:18	<Rug>	rob138: to test a different distro (without screwing up existing partitions)
07:18	<IMPOSSIBLE>	i've downloaded the tar.gz
07:18	<Ademan>	HEY, does anyone know why ubuntu is interpreting the "mousewheel left" input as a left click? (like i have a 4 way mousewheel, and when i move it left, it gets counted as a mouseclick)
07:18	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, i don't have windows..
07:18	<GTroy>	taru, only the programs you want on your system
07:18	<IMPOSSIBLE>	but i dont know how to run it
07:18	<disinterseted_pe>	ok then what?
07:18	<Flannel>	IMPOSSIBLE: right, tar.gz isn't ubuntu's packages.
07:18	<HymnToLife>	JohnDanger>	you most likely have some friens
07:18	<rob138>	amphi, i don't know who or where to suggest it to
07:18	<HymnToLife>	and most likely some of them use Windows
07:18	<rob138>	rug, ah
07:18	<IMPOSSIBLE>	then what I must download
07:18	<Taru>	GTroy, ok
07:18	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, nothing else i can do?
07:18	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, will a PC reboot help
07:19	<amphi>	rob138: xrandr is meant to do it, but not on my card it seems
07:19	<HymnToLife>	I doubt it
07:19	<Flannel>	IMPOSSIBLE: start up synaptic and search for spanish and office, or whatever you think might work
07:19	<rob138>	amphi, nor mine :)
07:19	<HymnToLife>	it seems yoout FAT filesystem is somehow corrupted
07:19	<IMPOSSIBLE>	ok and sorry my noobie act, but, how I do that :P
07:19	<rob138>	so if i wanted to run windows inside linux, i need A. windows installer cd B. vmware player... anything else?
07:19	<GTroy>	taru, java won't be installed in your browser though
07:19	<amphi>	rob138: I think I wasted some time trying this before... ;)
07:19	<JohnDanger>	HymnToLife, what the hell now it works suddenly
07:19	<Taru>	GTroy, Yes, I am mainly looking to install this Java program, since I want frostwire to work.
07:19	<vars>	i have a server install of ubuntu can someone tell me what the univers repo looks like for hoary
07:19	<HymnToLife>	lmao
07:19	<Flannel>	Ademan: try checking this page : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ManyButtonsMouseHowto
07:19	<Taru>	GTroy, Yeah, I see.
07:20	<test>	mount
07:20	<Ademan>	thanks Flannel
07:20	<GTroy>	well frostwire will work (I think) if you install java through synaptic
07:20	<Taru>	GTroy, I tried Samuli^'s "sudo atp-get install sun-java5-jre"
07:20	<Rug>	test: need help?
07:20	<Taru>	GTroy, No work.
07:21	<GTroy>	try it now
07:21	<test>	Rug, yup please.. i cant repair my grub
07:21	<IMPOSSIBLE>	ok flannel I get it :P is on System
07:21	<Samuli^>	Taru, it's not by that name in Breezy.
07:21	<IMPOSSIBLE>	thanks buddie
07:21	<Flannel>	vars: server vs non server makes no difference for repos.   https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesCliHowto will get you a general idea, the urls themselves should be the same, just the keywords
07:21	<GTroy>	taru, you might have need to set your repositories
07:21	<Taru>	Samuli^, Oh?
07:21	<IMPOSSIBLE>	I hope to install the s....d dictionary and not need to come more here and waste your time :P
07:21	<Samuli^>	Taru, Flannel remembered the name for suns java for breezy.
07:21	<Flannel>	vars: and, whereever that says breezy, you obviously want hoary
07:22	<vars>	i just need to know what to type to install the 2.4 kernal
07:22	<GTroy>	!java
07:22	<ubotu>	To install Java/Sun Java see Java on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats and also see !javadebs
07:22	<vars>	kernel
07:22	<Taru>	it gives me "E: unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another protocol using it?"
07:22	<Samuli^>	GTroy, that's old news.
07:22	<Rug>	Sorry I don't know much about grub repair, ask your specific question and hopefully someone in the channel can help you
07:22	<test>	Rug, when i boot onto my ubuntu it stops loading and have these msg..Alert /dev/hdc2 does not exist. Droping to a shell.
07:22	<Samuli^>	Sun's java is in the repositories now.
07:22	<Taru>	Samuli^, Oh ok ^^
07:22	<IMPOSSIBLE>	see ya pals
07:22	<GTroy>	samuli^ what's the right java for frostwire that taru needs?
07:23	<Flannel>	sun java should be fine.
07:23	<Rug>	test: if you boot with a Knoppix CD, can you access hdc2 ?
07:23	<Taru>	ok
07:23	<HellDragon>	hi, when i try to compile amule i get this
07:23	<HellDragon>	checking for C++ compiler default output file name... configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables
07:23	<Samuli^>	Flannel, tell taru the package name for breezy.
07:23	<HellDragon>	what is the problem ?
07:24	<test>	Rug, i dont know what is hdc2 either. currently im booting know on ubuntu live cd...
07:24	<Flannel>	!javadebs
07:24	<Rug>	HellDragon: Did you install build-essential ?
07:24	<HellDragon>	hm let me look
07:24	<x-Dieu>	howdy world! :)
07:24	<Flannel>	eh, alright.  um, sun-j2sdk1.5 Taru.
07:24	<Rug>	test: ok good.   Can you goto /media/hdc2 ?
07:24	<Taru>	Flannel, Thank you ^^
07:24	<HellDragon>	no , im dling it ty
07:25	<vars>	there is kernal source and kernal tree  what do i do/
07:25	<GTroy>	taru type in termina after you close synaptic 'sudo apt-get install sun-j2sdk1.5'
07:25	<rob138>	so if i wanted to run windows inside linux, i need A. windows installer cd B. vmware player... anything else?
07:25	<GTroy>	taru, make sure synaptic is closed
07:25	<amphi>	vars: 'kernel' ;)
07:25	<test>	Rug, theres no /media/hdc2 only /media/hda2 for my linux partitions
07:25	<HellDragon>	yay it works
07:25	<Taru>	No wonder, its open hah ;;
07:25	<|Sivik|>	will mplayer view .wmv files?

07:25	<vars>	amphi, ok kernel
07:25	<test>	Rug, my linux partitions is  on /media/hda2
07:25	<vars>	but which one
07:25	<GTroy>	taru, tell us if it works
07:25	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	maybe, with w32codecs
07:26	<HymnToLife>	not all of them are playable though
07:26	<vars>	|Sivik|, yes
07:26	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, so i need to install the w32codecs?
07:26	<Taru>	"E: couldn't find package"
07:26	<Taru>	hmm lol
07:26	<HymnToLife>	yes
07:26	<HellDragon>	checking for wx-config... no
07:26	<HellDragon>	checking that wxWidgets has support for large files... no
07:26	<HellDragon>	now i get errors with that
07:26	<Samuli^>	Taru, you have the repositories enabled do you?
07:26	<Taru>	wait im in root
07:26	<Taru>	exit
07:26	<Taru>	miss
07:26	<Rug>	test: in a term window type the following:   sudo mkdir /media/hdc2    then:  sudo mount /dev/hdc2 /media/hdc2
07:27	<Taru>	Samuli^, I think so.
07:27	<|Sivik|>	HymnToLife, i'm using your sources.list stuff so it can find that w32codecs, if i hadn't used the stuff you had, i wouldn't have been able to get it
07:27	<Samuli^>	Taru, better to make sure. Paste your /etc/apt/sources.list to pastebin
07:27	<HellDragon>	::(
07:27	<HymnToLife>	|Sivik|>	!w32codecs would have told you :)
07:27	<Samuli^>	Taru, cat /etc/apt/sources.list
07:28	<Taru>	Samuli^, ok
07:28	<HellDragon>	i cant find wx-config in synaptic
07:28	<CaptainMorgan>	!amarok
07:28	<HellDragon>	thats weird
07:28	<ZeZu>	is there somekind of trick to get nv-glx working in dapper?
07:28	<para_site>	what does apt-get --build source do ?
07:28	<HymnToLife>	para_site>	man apt-get
07:28	<Rug>	ZeZu: nah it's kind of easy
07:28	<CaptainMorgan>	!amarok
07:28	<Taru>	Samuli^, Ok i see comments and deb-src and deb http://.
07:28	<Samuli^>	para_site, it builds .deb packages out of the source.
07:28	<ubotu>	methinks amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/ - To install Amarok 1.4 on Ubuntu, see http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.php
07:28	<ZeZu>	Rug, not working though
07:29	<Samuli^>	Taru, copy & paste all that to pastebin
07:29	<ZeZu>	it wont even let me install nvidia-glx and nvidia-settings at the same time
07:29	<Taru>	Samuli^, ok
07:29	<Samuli^>	!tell Taru about pastebin
07:29	<para_site>	Samuli^ , what do I do with the .deb packages , I mean how do I install them ?
07:29	<Rug>	ZeZu: make sure you have nvidia-glx, retricted-modules installed
07:29	<Samuli^>	para_site, dpkg -i package.deb
07:29	<ZeZu>	Rug, i have both
07:29	<CaptainMorgan>	how can I use 1.4 amarok? it appears to only be compatible with kubuntu
07:29	<disinterseted_pe>	sudo aptitude install vlc totem-xine xine-ui i just used this command and it installed buti still done get any streamlink it said url was not found on this server
07:29	<para_site>	there is some .dsc file also that is created
07:29	<Samuli^>	para_site, easier to just use the binaries though.
07:29	<Taru>	how do i access pastebin?
07:30	<CaptainMorgan>	Taru, pastebin.com
07:30	<Madpilot>	CaptainMorgan, you can run KDE apps in Gnome, and vice versa
07:30	<rob138>	is there a way to view the goods of an enhanced CD?
07:30	<Taru>	CaptainMorgan, ok thanks^^
07:30	<para_site>	Samuli ^ , thanks
07:30	<IMPOSSIBLE>	well well well
07:30	<B1zz>	and in XFCE like i am :-p
07:30	<IMPOSSIBLE>	installed :D
07:30	<rredd4>	can ubuntu work with my wireless pcmcia card? easy or hard to config (I did it for debian, used ndiswrapper)
07:30	<IMPOSSIBLE>	with synaptics
07:31	<IMPOSSIBLE>	2 and half hour for it hahahaa
07:31	<Flannel>	rredd4: if you did it in debian, you can do it in ubuntu.  Once dapper comes out, it's got a full blown GUI fr it.
07:31	<Taru>	Still loading pastebin on web, hnn.
07:31	<Flannel>	!paste
07:31	<ubotu>	Please don't flood the channel! For best results use the pastebin at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and tell people the URL
07:31	<Taru>	Nevermind.
07:31	<rredd4>	Flannel  when is dapper due?
07:31	<Madpilot>	rredd4, June 1st
07:31	<IMPOSSIBLE>	Flannel thks :))
07:31	<Madpilot>	!dapper
07:31	<ubotu>	**** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
07:31	<B1zz>	you can also install Knetwork manager to manae your wirelss networks
07:32	<rob138>	but not until then
07:32	<Rug>	ZeZu: if you follow the directions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75074   it should work fine.
07:32	<Taru>	So paste and send?
07:33	<CaptainMorgan>	what am I missing? I got OK from doing this: http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.php
=== radiodog_ is now known as radiodog
07:33	<Samuli^>	Taru, Yeah.
07:33	<Samuli^>	Taru, and then tell us the url.
07:34	<Taru>	Samuli^, Ok
07:34	<johnstar>	does anyone know where to buy pressed ubutnu dvds?
07:34	<vars>	hey is there a free place to serve up a 200 mb website?
07:34	<ZeZu>	Rug
07:34	<Samuli^>	johnstar, You don't buy them. That's the whole point of ubuntu
07:34	<FliesLikeABrick>	johnstar they're free on www.ubuntu.com
07:34	<ZeZu>	don't work
07:34	<vars>	johnstar, you can't buy the,
07:34	<ZeZu>	The following packages will be REMOVED
07:34	<ZeZu>	  nvidia-glx
07:34	<ZeZu>	The following NEW packages will be installed
07:34	<ZeZu>	  nvidia-settings
07:34	<Rug>	johnstar: you can order them for free
07:34	<johnstar>	I know the free cds
07:34	<ZeZu>	tell me why that doesn't make sense
07:34	<ZeZu>	you need both but one removes the other ?
07:34	<johnstar>	I like the dvd with live on it too
07:34	<vars>	i think johnstar gets it
07:35	<Samuli^>	johnstar, you order them for free (and without postal-fees)
07:35	<johnstar>	+ dvd has faster install time
07:35	<test>	HELP!
07:35	<Rug>	ZeZu: what kernel version are you using?
07:35	<ZeZu>	Linux faerun 2.6.15-23-amd64-k8 #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu May 18 16:58:05 UTC 2006 x86_64 GNU/Linux
07:35	<rob138>	where do i find the C header files?
07:35	<Samuli^>	johnstar, I think they'll send you whatever they got.
07:36	<ZeZu>	all the latest crap
07:36	<vars>	hey i am having a hell of a time with cdrecord    is there another program to burn cds with that doesn't use it as a lib
07:36	<CaptainMorgan>	what am I missing? I got OK from doing this: http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.php
07:36	<CaptainMorgan>	and syn still says 1.3.7
07:36	<HellDragon>	how can i recompile wxwidgets with "Support for large files in wxWidgets is required by aMule.
07:36	<HellDragon>	                To continue you must recompile wxWidgets with support for
07:36	<HellDragon>	                large files enabled.
07:36	<HellDragon>	"
07:36	<HellDragon>	?
07:36	<johnstar>	I work in a computer store I want to see if I can get 100+ and sell them for like a buck or so
07:36	<bimberi>	rob138: install build-essential, it brings in those and other stuff useful for compiling
07:36	<test>	anyone can help me here abput restoring grub?
07:37	<amphi>	rob138: build-essential will install them
07:37	<dv_>	HellDragon, thats bad. you need to compile wxWidgets by yourself.
07:37	<Pimpshizzled>	hey folks, any of u guys know a good method of mounting an iso from a ntfs drive?
07:37	<HellDragon>	dv_, i just compiled it
07:37	<Rug>	test: I was helping you...   Did you try to mount it?
07:37	<dv_>	but look at the wxwidgets packages in the repository, maybe theres one with support for large files
07:37	<HellDragon>	but i dont know how to turn on large file support
07:37	<dv_>	hm
07:37	<ZeZu>	Rug, here is some weidness :
07:37	<ZeZu>	  nvidia-glx: Conflicts: nvidia-settings but 1.0-3ubuntu7 is to be installed
07:37	<dv_>	configure --help ?
07:37	<Taru>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14441
07:37	<test>	Rug, yes
07:37	<ZeZu>	E: Broken Packages
07:37	<rob138>	amphi, i have build-essential installed, a program i am installing is looking for them and defaults to /usr/src/linux/include and says it's not an existing directory
07:38	<HellDragon>	it says nothing useful dv_
07:38	<Rug>	ZeZu: I had that problem once before, I just nuked & reinstalled.  Sorry I don't know what else to tell you.
07:38	<dv_>	theres no --large-files option or something?
07:38	<dv_>	weird
07:38	<ZeZu>	and i wonder why people say package managers suck, but i've never had this problem before
07:38	<ZeZu>	bah
07:38	<Rug>	Test were you able to mount /dev/hdc2 ?
07:38	<cyphase>	hmm, no custom requests in ShipIt anymore
07:38	<dv_>	try #wxwidgets then
07:38	<Rug>	ZeZu: 90% of the time it is bullet-proof.
07:39	<Rug>	cyphase: Dapper is too near release
07:39	<cyphase>	Rug, what do you mean?
07:39	<Rug>	test: were you able to mount /dev/hdc2 ?
07:39	<rob138>	amphi : What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel?
07:39	<amphi>	rob138: that's looking for kernel headers
07:39	<test>	Rug, i dnt have hdc2 on my system
07:39	<rob138>	amphi, where should i point it?
07:39	<johnstar>	does anyone know if sata is hotplugable in ubuntu?
07:39	<test>	Rug, only hda2
07:39	<Rug>	cyphase: that is my guess.   June 1st Dapper will be released. so there will be NEW CD's
07:39	<cyphase>	Rug, i know..
07:39	<amphi>	rob138: install the kernel-headers package, perhaps
07:40	<bimberi>	rob138: sudo aptitude install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
07:40	<cyphase>	Rug, with previous versions you could set a custom number of each cd
07:40	<Rug>	test: that is why grub can't mount it.
07:40	<amphi>	rob138: doesn't make any difference what _mine_ is
07:40	<ZeZu>	i'll leave the nvidia-settings out and then just configure it all manually by hand i guess
07:40	<ZeZu>	pain in the ass
07:40	<Rug>	cyphase: ahh sorry
07:40	<cyphase>	Rug, not the version :)
07:40	<test>	Rug, so what shoul i do?
07:41	<Rug>	test: did you have a more then one hard-drive in your PC?
07:41	<rob138>	bimberi, why not apt-get?
07:41	<bimberi>	!aptitude
07:41	<ubotu>	aptitude is another front-end to apt, like apt-get, adept and Synaptic.  Unlike them, aptitude remembers what dependencies were installed with a package and can remove them if you uninstall. It also has a (somewhat buggy) text-mode interface.
07:41	<test>	Rug, nope only one
07:41	<bimberi>	rob138: ^^^^^ :)
07:41	<HellDragon>	iji
07:41	<Rug>	test: then why is grub pointing to hdc2 ?
07:41	<rob138>	bimeri thanks
07:42	<rob138>	what are these headers?
07:42	<bimberi>	rob138: np :)
07:42	<test>	Rug, i dont know
07:42	<Rug>	test: one sec..
07:43	<test>	rUG,OK
07:43	<bimberi>	rob138: that i don't know, those who know C(++) might
07:44	<Rug>	test: Do you knwo what partition your "/" is on?
07:44	<CaptainMorgan>	alrigh, Im resorting to rythmbox... how come I have no sound??
07:44	<test>	Rug, it is on Hda2
07:44	<CaptainMorgan>	other apps and terminals produce sound.. damn GAIM makes sound... but not my audio players..
07:45	<Rug>	test: join #paste
07:45	<test>	Rug, when i type fdisk . these what came out /de/
07:45	<amphi>	rob138: they contain function declarations, macros, defines, etc. for c source files
07:45	<polopolo>	hello all
07:45	<test>	join #paste
07:45	<test>	ok

07:46	<CaptainMorgan>	yep
07:47	<CaptainMorgan>	dammit.. I got it... but that's just weird.. I closed out everything except X-chat and rythmbox.. and sound produced
07:48	<polopolo>	If I sign the code of conduct, i'm then a member of the ubuntu team?
07:48	<CaptainMorgan>	no
07:48	<CaptainMorgan>	;)
07:48	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, ahh, you have problems esd hogging your dsp.
07:48	<CaptainMorgan>	dsp?
07:48	<Samuli^>	soundcard.
07:48	<CaptainMorgan>	hm..

07:49	<Rug>	test: wrong window
07:49	<test>	for my linux
07:49	<test>	/dev/hda for my windows
07:49	<test>	sorry
07:49	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, for quick solution, try System>Administration>soundsystem switcher or whatever that's called.
07:49	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, and change it from esd to alsa.
07:50	<dv_>	btw, there is a sound daemon called sid, right?
07:50	<polopolo>	If I sign the code of conduct, i'm then a member of the ubuntu team?
07:50	<Flannel>	No
07:51	<CaptainMorgan>	:)
07:51	<Flannel>	http://www.ubuntu.com/community/processes/newmember
07:51	<amphi>	polopolo: perhaps it's a necessary but unsifficient condition ;)
07:51	<polopolo>	ok
07:51	<Flannel>	it is!  If youre a member, you have signed the code of Conduct
07:51	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, see http://www.ubuntuguide.org/#configuresoundproperly
07:51	<CaptainMorgan>	Samuli^, System>Administration>and no soundsystem/audio, or whatever option
07:51	<CaptainMorgan>	oh..
07:52	<Flannel>	Samuli^, CaptainMorgan, ubuntuguide isn't a good resource.
07:52	<Flannel>	use the wiki/forums
07:52	<varsendagger>	hey i want to put a website on the internet
07:52	<Samuli^>	Flannel, it does a good job with that configuration for sound.
07:52	<varsendagger>	i have a computer that i can leave on all the time but i have no idea how to go about tdoing this
07:53	<Samuli^>	I'm not sure why breezy is so crippled by default.
07:53	<varsendagger>	i have a DSL connection
07:53	<Flannel>	varsendagger: you'll want to install [whatever server, apache is common]  configure your router for traffic, and get a DNS (dyndns is a popular one, if youve got a dynamic IP (cable/dsl/etc))
07:53	<clever_>	how do would i go about seting up a finger print reader in ubuntu?
07:54	<varsendagger>	how do i configure my router for traffic?
07:54	<CaptainMorgan>	Flannel.. whoa.. I gotta reboot?
07:54	<Flannel>	varsendagger: you'll want to port forward 80
07:54	<Flannel>	CaptainMorgan: erm,what?
07:54	<clever_>	foward port 80 to the pc thats running the server
07:55	<CaptainMorgan>	says so in that link
07:55	<Flannel>	varsendagger: unless you want to change the port to something else.
07:55	<adamc>	what packge needs installed to get stander posix development docs
07:55	<adamc>	ie man print/write/perror etc
07:55	<varsendagger>	ok this is shounding too difficult   alll i have is a dsl modem
07:55	<T`>	i get swap device not found when i try to hibernate
07:56	<T`>	and mount deosnt show my swap (/dev/hda6) mounted
07:56	<T`>	but i have an entry in fstab
07:56	<rawhead>	hi all
07:56	<clever_>	ahh then you can skip the router stuff varsendagger
07:56	<T`>	anyone know why this happens?
07:56	<varsendagger>	yes
07:56	<Flannel>	varsendagger: it's reallynot.  you need a server (thats the software, since you already have the hardware) you need to allow the outside world to communicate with it (thats the router bit) then you need to allow the outsideworld to be able to find it, that's the dyndns part
07:56	<clever_>	T` the swap is never mounted
07:57	<T`>	clever_, oh.. actually in /proc/swaps i see /dev/hda6 partition 2040212 0 -1
07:57	<Ademan>	anyone here use anjuta?
07:57	<Flannel>	varsendagger: if you don't have a router, do you expect to have two PCs online all the time?
07:57	<clever_>	Flannel, if varsendagger has just a dsl box wired right into the pc he wont need a router opened up
07:57	<T`>	clever_, then why is hibernate complaining.. hmm
07:57	<CaptainMorgan>	Flannel.. hmm... I just restarted rythmbox and it's playing.. I don't see a need to reboot... at least not right now..
07:57	<CaptainMorgan>	phew
07:57	<varsendagger>	ok i will be right back
07:57	<Flannel>	CaptainMorgan, it was Samuli^ who was helping you, not me ;)
07:57	<CaptainMorgan>	ooops
07:58	<CaptainMorgan>	Samuli^, :)
07:58	<varsendagger>	funny storry i can't get my cd burner working and i need to get 170mb of web page to a guy
07:58	<Samuli^>	I just want peeps to mess up their computers :)
07:58	<clever_>	how do would i go about seting up a finger print reader in ubuntu?
07:58	<CaptainMorgan>	!!
07:58	<ubotu>	CaptainMorgan: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
07:58	<CaptainMorgan>	oops..
07:58	<Samuli^>	hehe.
07:58	<Flannel>	varsendagger: ah.  ok.  get apache, (apt-get install apache2) and put the stuff in /var/www then give the guy your  IP addy.
07:59	<CaptainMorgan>	Samuli^, that resource wanted me to reboot after config.. bleh
07:59	<Flannel>	varsendagger: and, that's basically it ;)
07:59	<varsendagger>	what is my ipADDy
07:59	<clever_>	www.whatismyip.com
07:59	<varsendagger>	Vars is men too
07:59	<vars>	look i'm in two places !!!!
07:59	<vars>	me
07:59	<CaptainMorgan>	no!
07:59	<vars>	anyway
08:00	<Icomey>	I've got a question.
08:00	<Samuli^>	CaptainMorgan, the thing is that esd was hogging your dsp and now that nothing else uses it, you have sound in rhythbox. I think you do need a reboot to get it working in a non-hogging way, but you can do that later.
08:00	<CaptainMorgan>	cool, thanks
08:00	<clever_>	my sound card randomly plays the audio at 200% normal speed
08:00	<vars>	ok apache is being installed
08:00	<clever_>	any way to fix it?
08:01	<Flannel>	clever_: that's not a soundcard problem, I dont think.
08:01	<clever_>	its within linux drivers area
08:01	<clever_>	normaly mplayer ends up playing the audio at 200% speed
08:01	<clever_>	and gaim cant make any sounds
08:01	<clever_>	and it fixes itself randomly
08:02	<Flannel>	google help any?
08:02	<Icomey>	I have Ubuntu installed on a 13 GB hdc, and I want to format a 40 GB hdd for use as file storage (pictures, music, etc.).
08:02	<clever_>	didnt try google
08:02	<clever_>	just had a talk about it in #mplayer
08:02	<Flannel>	clever_: seems unique enough that google would be helpful
08:02	<clever_>	i just set mplayer to 50% speed
08:02	<clever_>	and the card doubles it bringing it back to 100
08:02	<clever_>	the lazy way to fix it:P
08:03	<Ademan>	so no one here uses anjuta?
08:03	<Icomey>	Ademan, what is anjuta?
08:03	<HymnToLife>	!anjuta
08:03	<ubotu>	Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, HymnToLife
08:03	<jcsston>	how hard would it be to upgrade a driver written for the 2.4 linux kernel to 2.6?
08:03	<vars>	what is anjunta that sounds familiar
08:03	<khaled>	hi.. when i use apt-get, i get a message saying E: Broken packages
08:04	<khaled>	what might cause that ?
08:04	<Ademan>	Icomey: its an IDE
08:04	<Ademan>	for c and c++
08:04	<HymnToLife>	even Ubotu the Allmight doesn't know bout it
08:04	<jeremie_>	salut a tou
08:04	<HymnToLife>	+y
08:04	<HymnToLife>	!fr
08:04	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
08:04	<clever_>	ubotu cant even help me with my finger print reader
08:04	<jeremie_>	yes
08:04	<ubotu>	I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, clever_
08:04	<clever_>	see:P
08:04	<vars>	Flannel, ok i have apache2 installed and my index.htm and files in /var/www
08:04	<HymnToLife>	ubotu is stupid
08:04	<jeremie_>	thanks man
08:04	<ubotu>	HymnToLife: Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
08:05	<vars>	i don't have x on the comp i want to use as the server is there a way to get the ip addy?
08:05	<clever_>	wget www.whatismyip.com
08:06	<clever_>	then cat  or less or vi the file it makes
08:06	<Ademan>	the ip of the comp?
08:06	<Ademan>	in the console type "route"
08:06	<clever_>	ifconfig may work if the dsl is right on the linux box
08:06	<clever_>	on my system that just gives me 192.168.1.1 and 255.255.255.0
08:06	<Ademan>	and route didnt do the trick
08:06	<Ademan>	yeah no
08:06	<Ademan>	lol
08:07	<clever_>	ifconfig or wget www.whatismyip.com
08:07	<clever_>	or try using links as a text browser
08:07	<Ademan>	ifconfig wont do it either if you're behind even one router
08:07	<clever_>	yeah
08:07	<clever_>	which is why i said if the dsl is right on the linux box
08:07	<CaptainMorgan>	this may sound stupid.. but I got a 250 gig ext hdd backup that's ntfs, is the process for partitioning it in say.. half for linux as simple as internal installations?
08:07	<HymnToLife>	but if you're behint a router you certainly have other boxes on your network
08:08	<h3h_timo>	does anyone use dijjer?
08:08	<Icomey>	I have an extra hard drive that I is under /dev/hdd that I want to format for data such as pictures or music or whatnot. How would I go about doing that?
08:08	<vars>	clever_, ok i got it
08:08	<Icomey>	I have an extra hard drive that is under /dev/hdd that I want to format for data such as pictures or music or whatnot. How would I go about doing that?
08:08	<vars>	my ip addres that is
08:08	<Icomey>	There.
08:09	<Icomey>	Wait.
08:09	<Ademan>	where does wget put stuff?
08:09	<clever_>	current directory
08:09	<khaled>	Ademan, .
08:09	<clever_>	ls -ltr
08:09	<clever_>	look at the last edited file which ls -ltr should list last
08:09	<vars>	clever_, what do i do next?
08:10	<clever_>	open that ip in a web browser and you should see the files you put under /var/www/
08:10	<vars>	i am on the same network
08:10	<clever_>	that should make it a bit easyer/faster
08:10	<vars>	it gives me info about my modem
08:10	<clever_>	what is the ip?
08:10	<HymnToLife>	vars >	the enter the network IP
08:11	<Mantice>	When does dapper come out
08:11	<CaptainMorgan>	!dapper
08:11	<ubotu>	**** News Flash **** Dapper has its own channel #ubuntu+1 please join there for dapper (the beta of the next release) configuration, install,  or other conversation, dapper will be in #ubuntu starting 1st of june :-) But not until than
08:11	<HymnToLife>	most likely 192.168.x.
08:11	<Flannel>	HymnToLife: no.
08:11	<clever_>	also irc isnt very secure and i can see that vars's ip on the web is 209.181.2.222
08:11	<Mantice>	noooooooooooooooo
08:11	<vars>	hey that is it
08:11	<Mantice>	What is Ubuntu 6.06 LTS ?
08:11	<T`>	anyone know how to turn the fan off on a laptop? its ALWAYS on for me :(
08:11	<Flannel>	Mantice: Dapper.
08:11	<HymnToLife>	Flannel>	why no ?
08:11	<Mantice>	Whats LTS ?
08:11	<disinterseted_pe>	i cant get streamlink to work
08:12	<rob138>	wow, so i tried to install vmware player and it destroyed my system,  how do i remove it from starting with the kernel it installed itself to?
08:12	<Flannel>	HymnToLife: because he's not behind a router.  That'd be his subnet
08:12	<vars>	i don;t know
08:12	<clever_>	T`, my cpu fan is off but turns on when it heats up and i forget where i changed it
08:12	<Flannel>	Mantice: Long Time Support, or Long Term, or something like that.
08:12	<clever_>	i think its in my bios
08:12	<T`>	clever_, thats what i need!
08:12	<crimsun>	Mantice: long term support.
08:12	<T`>	clever_, really? bios .. hmm
08:12	<clever_>	im on a dell laptop
08:12	<T`>	on acer here
08:12	<clever_>	both of my dells do that
08:12	<Mantice>	So if I order it now from ship it when its released it will come in the mail ?
08:13	<Flannel>	Mantice: yes, shipit orders are for dapper.  They wont be sent until after june1, obviously.
08:13	<vars>	ok cai just tried to run apache2 and it said permission denied   could not bind to address [::]  :80
08:13	<Mantice>	Yeah
08:13	<Mantice>	Thanks Fannel
08:13	<Flannel>	vars: it's already running
08:13	<vars>	good
08:13	<vars>	can anyone see my website
08:14	<clever_>	your router i think is blocking every1
08:14	<vars>	well that is cute
08:14	<clever_>	you can only access from a pc thats on your side of the router
08:14	<HymnToLife>	vars>	you have to forward port 80
08:14	<clever_>	till you edit the security
08:14	<vars>	HymnToLife, please tell me how to do that
08:15	<HymnToLife>	vars >	depends on your router, RTFM ;)
08:15	<dmizer>	for the love of pete, can someone tell me how to stop my vmware server?
08:15	<clever_>	i got a site which explains on about 200 diferent routers
08:16	<clever_>	vars, check http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm
08:16	<rob138>	can someone please help me remove vmware from my system?
08:16	<HellDragon>	hi
08:16	<clever_>	rob138, where did you get vmware for linux?
08:16	<HellDragon>	how can i lauch amule ? i type amule and it doesnt work (in console)
08:16	<disinterseted_pe>	does anyone know which mplayer works with windows media streamlink?
08:16	<rob138>	clever_ from vmware.com
08:17	<Ademan>	HellDragon: i just do it from Applications->Internet->aMule
08:17	<HellDragon>	its not there ademan
08:17	<rob138>	clever_ it's the player
08:17	<clever_>	player?
08:18	<vars>	clever_, ii got the right make and modle   what am i looking for?
08:19	<vars>	ahh i see now
08:19	<rob138>	clever_ VMWare palyer
08:19	<rob138>	if i remove /etc/init.d/vmware will vmware stop from starting when i start ubuntu?
08:20	<elkbuntu>	HymnToLife, that was an inappropriate way to say that
08:20	<dmizer>	rob: didn't seem to help me any.
08:20	<HymnToLife>	to say what ?
08:21	<elkbuntu>	<HymnToLife>	vars >	depends on your router, RTFM ;)
08:21	<elkbuntu>	we do not use that four letter acronym here
08:21	<rob138>	dmizer huh?
08:21	<HellDragon>	i bet you feel nuts elkbuntu
08:21	<elkbuntu>	HellDragon, eh?
08:21	<vars>	what does RTFM mean?
08:21	<dmizer>	rob: i can't get rid of vmware either.
08:21	<HymnToLife>	!rtfm
08:21	<ubotu>	HymnToLife: Do they come in packets of five. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
08:21	<elkbuntu>	vars it means: read the * manual
08:21	<clever_>	read the f... manual
08:22	<elkbuntu>	fill in the star
08:22	<vars>	ok i agree i should read the manua;
08:22	<HymnToLife>	elkbuntu>	notice the smiley right after it
08:22	<rob138>	dmizer, crap. i really want to
08:22	<dmizer>	i don't know what file stars the **** thing, but it's persistent.
08:22	<elkbuntu>	actually derived from 'read the fsck manpage' or so i've been told
08:22	<rob138>	dmizer, yeah now i can't boot the kernel it installed itself to cuz it'll either freeze or kill my internet
08:23	<elkbuntu>	HymnToLife, the term should still not be used, it's arrogant and rude
08:23	<rob138>	shit
08:23	<dmizer>	kills my internet too.
08:23	<dmizer>	because it creates a network bridge
=== dv_____ is now known as dv_
08:23	<rob138>	dmizer, oh thats what that is
08:23	<rob138>	dmizer, so what do you do?
08:24	<dmizer>	rob: i haven't completely figured it out yet, but it doesn't start the bridge with interfaces.
08:24	<vars>	ok that website that clever_  gave me explainde what port forwarding is but not how
08:24	<rob138>	dmizer, what do you mean
08:24	<clever_>	under the fowarding link in the top list it should show how to do it for nearly all routers
08:25	<dmizer>	rob: network devices are enabled during boot through an interfaces file in /etc/network called interfaces.
08:25	<dmizer>	rob: but vmware enables it's network bridge somewher else.
08:26	<rob138>	dmizer, right i know that, but then there is a vmware service that starts the vmnet services that kill the other /etc/network ones
08:26	<rob138>	i think?
08:26	<elkbuntu>	hmm.. i havent cleaned old kernels out since i installed... iirc you just do the complete removal for the ones no longer needed, right?
08:26	<dmizer>	rob: that is exactly correct, and i can't find it.
08:26	<dmizer>	rob: i'd like to put a bullet in it's head ... lol
08:26	<Icomey>	What filesystem type should I use for a 40 GB HD to be used as random file storage (music, pictures, documents) for an Ubuntu 5.10 system?
08:27	<lendyl>	robl38, i want to use and activate evolution mail... how?
08:27	<rob138>	dmizer, it wasn't /etc/init.d/vmware? agreed, i am kicking myself for installing it, i had a solid system until this little fucker
08:27	<khaled>	Icomey, fat16
08:27	<Icomey>	Will that work for 40 GB?
08:27	<Samuli^>	Icomey, If it's just for Ubuntu, then ext3
08:27	<noiesmo>	Icomey, ext3 or if you dual boot maybe fat32
08:27	<Samuli^>	lol, don't you use fat16
08:27	<khaled>	he he :)
08:27	<vars>	how do i create a static ip addres?
08:27	<rob138>	lendyl what?
08:27	<khaled>	reiserfs
08:27	<ubuntu>	laba diena
08:27	<dmizer>	rob: i completely removed the /etc/init.d/vmware folder from my system, and it still comes up.

08:28	<noiesmo>	Icomey, use ext3
08:28	<Samuli^>	Icomey, ext3 is good then.
08:28	<Icomey>	85 Linux extended?
08:28	<slackern>	vars: i have a headless router running with one static and one dhcp nic in it if you want the interfaces file
08:28	<elkbuntu>	i thought it was 82 or 83...
08:28	<noiesmo>	83
08:29	<elkbuntu>	woot, i remembered
08:29	<Samuli^>	'83
08:29	<vars>	slackern, yeah
08:29	<lendyl>	rob138, i dnt know how to use te evolution- mail, i tried to send message but it says broken pipes , wats that?
08:29	<Icomey>	New primary or logical partition?
08:29	<Icomey>	primary?
08:29	<noiesmo>	yes
08:29	<Samuli^>	Primary of course.
08:29	<slackern>	vars: http://peterj1978.no-ip.com:8080/interfaces
08:29	<Aqui1a>	things that are compatable with ubuntu will be compatable with kubuntu yes?
08:30	<rob138>	lendyl, i am not a good person to ask, i'm just a dumb noob
08:30	<vars>	Aqui1a, not everything
08:30	<Icomey>	Thanks.
08:30	<noiesmo>	Aqui1a, should be
08:30	<Aqui1a>	;o
08:30	<Samuli^>	Aqui1a, depends on what you mean.
08:30	<slackern>	vars: i had some problems setting it up first too but that one is running on the machine now.
08:30	<HymnToLife>	Aqui1a>	of cource, since Ubuntu and Kubuntu are the same thing
08:30	<elkbuntu>	Aqui1a, of course, providing you get all the dependancies, which can be quite a few libs sometimes
08:30	<vars>	what is a cli browser?
08:30	<noiesmo>	Aqui1a, you may need extra packages to satisfy deps but apt should pick it up
08:30	<vars>	rather a name
08:31	<Aqui1a>	eh? lol
08:31	<slackern>	vars: you could just wget the file and edit it
08:31	<Samuli^>	Aqui1a, most programs etc. work in kde and in gnome, but well.. it's just better to use gnome apps in gnome and kde apps in kde.
08:31	<slackern>	vars: otherwise you have links and lynx for cli http browsing.
08:31	<vars>	slackern, wow htat is easy
08:31	<lendyl>	rob, thanks
08:32	<Icomey>	One more question, where would you recommend I mount it?
08:32	<spikeb>	if we could only patch qt or gtk to use the other's file dialogue boxes
08:32	<rencrash>	please help me with this, i cant get any mp3/avi/mpg/midi file to play, what do i need to install or do?
08:32	<noiesmo>	Icomey, check your /etc/fstab you'll find entries that will mount it on boot
08:32	<slackern>	ahh wonderful, today is windows support friends day *pukes*
08:32	<HymnToLife>	!tell rencrash about multimedia

08:48	<vars_>	ok i know the two ports that i need to forward is there a way to do that CLI?
08:48	<slackern>	vars: you needed firewall rules for a portforward?
08:48	<slackern>	vars: i just pasted 2 rows for you but you missed it.
08:48	<vars_>	slackern, i don't follow you

08:49	<vars_>	slackern, now what do those do
08:49	<slackern>	that will forward port 22000 on the externalinterface to the internal ip 192.168.0.1 and port 22
08:49	<HymnToLife>	!firestarter
08:49	<ubotu>	Ubuntu has, like every other linux distribution, firewalling built into the kernel. A simple frontend to this firewall is firestarter, which can be installed via synaptic.
08:50	<HymnToLife>	is a GUI tio do it in  more user-friendly way
08:50	<Aqui1a>	Is it ok if i make 2 partitions, 1 for linux and one for windows? or do i need some kind of software to do this?

08:50	<vars_>	hmm
08:50	<noiesmo>	Aqui1a, yesok no special software

08:51	<vars_>	slackern, i need to forward 80 and 447
08:51	<HymnToLife>	windows first
08:51	<noiesmo>	Aqui1a, it's easier to install windows the linux as linux will do boot loader for both os
08:51	<slackern>	vars: you need to change 'EXTERNALINTERFACE' to your external eth0 or eth1
08:51	<noiesmo>	the then
08:51	<Aqui1a>	ok ty
08:52	<slackern>	vars: ahh what is the external interface of the firewall eth0 or eth1?

08:53	<HellDragon>	why i still cant resize my ext3 partitiion on a live cd !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
08:53	<vars_>	i think it is eth0
08:53	<Samuli^>	HellDragon, try and unmount your swap.
08:54	<vars_>	what is shorewall
08:54	<slackern>	vars: and adress of machine that should get the port 80 and 447 connectiongs?
08:54	<HellDragon>	i need to resize my /

08:54	<Icomey>	I'm back.
08:54	<vars_>	where do i need that
08:54	<HellDragon>	when i resize a partition with qtparted i lose all data on it ^
08:54	<vars_>	is shorewall ncurses?
08:54	<slackern>	vars: No
08:55	<disinterseted_pe>	yes thats what came up
08:55	<noiesmo>	Icomey, ok what are you using to do partition cfdisk or fdisk
08:55	<Icomey>	I used cfdisk
08:55	<HymnToLife>	Parted can't resie ext
08:55	<slackern>	vars: but it has a much smarter/easier way of setting up rules in config files to make it easy to view and edit.
08:55	<HymnToLife>	I don't know if it is possibl at all
08:55	<HellDragon>	what i need to use

08:56	<Icomey>	And if I want it as reiserfs?
08:56	<disinterseted_pe>	so after seeing the argument stuff what do i need to do to install it?
08:56	<dreamthief>	is all your data on one partition? @ HellDragon
08:57	<dreamthief>	or do u have multiple partitions and only root needs to be resized?
08:57	<HellDragon>	everything is on /
08:57	<dreamthief>	lol
08:57	<vars_>	the destination should be 209.... or 192...

08:58	<dreamthief>	try windows + partition magic
08:58	<dreamthief>	^^
08:58	<Icomey>	I have a friend who might be able to help.
08:58	<HellDragon>	dreamthief, NO not partition magic
08:58	<HellDragon>	it breaks grub everytime
08:58	<dreamthief>	:-P
08:58	<HellDragon>	i passed 3hrs to repair it today after using part magicv
08:58	<Icomey>	noiesmo: Thanks for the help.
08:58	<noiesmo>	Icomey, in terminal type man mkfs.reiserfs
08:58	<tangent>	anyone know what config file the "ignore host list" feature in network proxy prefs uses?
08:59	<dreamthief>	then use a live cd to restore grub
08:59	<HellDragon>	it took 3hrs to restore it
08:59	<HellDragon>	on a livecd
08:59	<noiesmo>	Icomey, if its on your system then mkfs.reiserfs /dev/hxx
08:59	<vars_>	slackern, what about the 22000?
08:59	<dreamthief>	bulllshit @ HellDragon
09:00	<HellDragon>	:(
09:00	<dreamthief>	it's not that difficult
09:00	<HellDragon>	yes
09:00	<HellDragon>	it had a lot of problems
09:00	<dreamthief>	and next time you install linux you should really should have read about file systems and partitions before
09:00	<Icomey>	noiesmo: Thank you, it worked.
09:00	<noiesmo>	Icomey, np :)
09:00	<Icomey>	And now to mount it.
09:00	<Icomey>	Heh... I'm such a bum.

09:01	<HellDragon>	im too afraid to use part magic
09:01	<GTroy>	how do I compile something in java?
09:01	<slackern>	vars_: that will forward those ports for you if you make sure eth0 is correct external interface and change the ip adress
09:01	<HellDragon>	ok dreamthief ill do it
09:01	<Taru>	GTroy, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14443, please check it.

09:03	<vars_>	slackern, only one cat5 interface
09:04	<spikeb>	yeah, stupid frostwire doesn't run with classpath
09:04	<Taru>	I keep having to add those 2 in repo everytime I get back in synaptic.
09:04	<Taru>	I thought it would save.
09:04	<dreamthief>	everybody messes around with linux but most of them don't have the slightest clue about what they're doing ... doing bullshit because of an lack of knowledge and then crying for help :-(
09:04	<GTroy>	I don't think it matters taru
09:04	<Taru>	GTroy, hmm
09:04	<slackern>	vars_: well do please share the information if it's needed does it use ppp or something as a external interface?
09:05	<noiesmo>	Taru, on my site is the java and frostwire info you need http://noiesmo.dnsalias.net/index.php?topic=Gnulinux
09:05	<Taru>	GTroy, So, what is the solution? that command was to update to most current Java.
09:05	<slackern>	in that case it should be ppp instead of eth0
09:05	<disinterseted_pe>	ok how do i install realplayer 10?
09:05	<vars_>	slackern, can i make those adjustments and then just chmod a+x and ./ that script
09:05	<slackern>	or whatever ppp stuff uses :)
09:05	<Taru>	noiesmo, Ok, cool, thanks^^
09:05	<noiesmo>	Taru, I run frostwire had to do these things
09:05	<vars_>	i don't think it uses ppp

09:31	<thenetduck>	aaaaaah!
09:31	<Seq>	and has permissions, but that usually doesn't matter

09:32	<asdx>	hi
09:32	<asdx>	does anyone knows how to delete all the iptables rules
09:32	<thenetduck>	is anyone here a computer engineering major?
09:32	<rob138>	seq, good info, i googled and found that there are "things" (for lack of better word right now) that allow windows and osx to read ext2, would that be a good direction to go?
09:32	<asdx>	or disable a nat rule
09:32	<noiesmo>	Taru, no probs :)
09:33	<La_PaRCa>	asdx, iptables -F all
09:33	<slvmchn>	can someone help me? when i try to view a webpage in firefox that has a video in it, the window shows up and the little slider bar/play button, but it says something about totem not being able to open it
09:33	<slvmchn>	or sometimes just says nothing
09:33	<Icomey>	noiesmo: So, shall I set mine up similarly?
09:33	<slackern>	brb
09:33	<Seq>	rob138: i have a mac, but have not tried ext2 reading with it. i have used the windows ext2 filesystem driver, it works pretty well, aside from throwing a RECYCLED folder on each partition :p
09:33	<thenetduck>	slvmchn you don't have the correct codecs for your video player
09:33	<noiesmo>	Icomey, just add what you need for yours
09:33	<thenetduck>	you need to install them
09:33	<Seq>	rob138: but if you ever take the machine to somebody elses house, they won't have the driver
09:33	<slvmchn>	thenetduck: i can watch .mpegs in xine no problem though, how do apply the codecs to totem?
09:33	<La_PaRCa>	thenetduck, why did you need a comp eng?
09:34	<Seq>	rob138: the device, rather
09:34	<noiesmo>	Icomey, I gotta head off for a while I'll be back later
09:34	<Icomey>	Okay.
09:34	<rob138>	seq, would fat32 be alright if it was purely for music/videos/files that don't need permissions ?
09:34	<asdx>	La_PaRCa: iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
09:34	<Icomey>	noiesmo:
09:34	<Icomey>	one more thing quickly
09:34	<thenetduck>	go to command line try typeing this in.....   sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
09:34	<La_PaRCa>	asdx, then just iptables -F
09:34	<noiesmo>	Icomey, yes
09:34	<Icomey>	type is reiserfs?
09:34	<Seq>	rob138: yeah, i use fat32 on all my removable drives
09:35	<noiesmo>	Icomey, replace ext3 with reiserfs
09:35	<rob138>	seq, thanks
09:35	<Icomey>	noiesmo: Okay, thanks
09:35	<Icomey>	noiesmo: You've been a great help.
09:35	<asdx>	La_PaRCa: my computer in the network is still having internet access...
09:35	<slvmchn>	i think i tried that thenetduck, but let me give it a shot
09:35	<noiesmo>	np ;)
09:35	<asdx>	La_PaRCa: after i did iptables -F
09:35	<thenetduck>	ok
09:35	<JoshRA>	Hello??
09:35	<slvmchn>	Hello!
09:35	<La_PaRCa>	asdx, it shouldnt
09:36	<asdx>	La_PaRCa: yeah, weird
09:36	<La_PaRCa>	asdx, unless you are not natting but using a proxy
09:36	<La_PaRCa>	asdx, do iptables -L see if the rules are gone
09:36	<para_site>	I did 'apt-get -b source <package>' and ended up with a lot of .deb files and a .dsc and a  .changes file , how do I install the package ?
09:36	<asdx>	lol, f*ck! it was just the cache of ie
09:36	<asdx>	sorry
09:37	<asdx>	i hate ie
09:37	<para_site>	can somebody help?
09:38	<vars_>	yeah
09:38	<thenetduck>	i have the ie extention on firefox but it doesn't work. it says a plug-in isn't there. Anyone know how to fix this? or how to install the plugin?
09:38	<para_site>	so how do I install the package ?
09:38	<slvmchn>	thenetduck: looked like it installed some stuff when i did that line, but still, no luck with the movies
09:39	<eggzeck>	para_site, dpkg -i *.deb
09:39	<thenetduck>	what movie is it?
09:39	<eggzeck>	para_site, where '*' is replaced with package name.
09:39	<thenetduck>	i mean where is the movie?
09:39	<slvmchn>	thenetduck: i'm not seriously concerned about it though, just more annoying than anything, most things i can watch in xine, it's just annoying for sites that have the movie embedded and don't allow download
09:39	<para_site>	eggzeck , yes but what about the .dsc and .changes file
09:39	<slvmchn>	anything
09:39	<slvmchn>	i can only watch flashes
09:39	<thenetduck>	hum ..
09:39	<slvmchn>	doesn't matter if it's .mpeg or .avi or what, if i want to watch it i have to download it
09:39	<slvmchn>	and use xine
09:39	<para_site>	eggzeck , don't we need to touch those ?
09:39	<slvmchn>	no biggie
09:40	<thenetduck>	i have my default web media player xine
09:40	<slackern>	back
09:40	<thenetduck>	maby you can try doing that
09:40	<para_site>	eggzeck , some of the .debs are dependent on the others , is there anything like a group install ?
09:40	<Aqui1a>	does anyone have a link explaining how to install windows and linux on 2 seperate partitions pliz? :)
09:40	<La_PaRCa>	thenetduck, how about the totem-xine-firefox-plugin?

09:43	<edulix>	this gives me "permission denied": sudo /bin/echo 4 >	/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling
09:43	<edulix>	 understand that the problem is that I execute /bin/echo 4 with sude, but the redirection is being executed wth my current user ?
09:43	<La_PaRCa>	!dma
09:43	<thenetduck>	does this show up red?
09:43	<La_PaRCa>	asdx, its easy by ip. I recommend you google for an iptables howto
09:43	<vars_>	no
09:44	<slackern>	vars_: I would recommend reading up a bit on shorewall since it's quite easy to understand and maintain when you've understood the documentation for it, i spent a day with it and reading guides and such
09:44	<La_PaRCa>	disinterseted_pe, try this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DMA
09:45	<vars_>	that is coo
09:45	<La_PaRCa>	ubotu dma is Experiencing jumpy DVD playback? Try https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DMA
09:45	<ubotu>	...but dma is already something else...
09:45	<slackern>	vars_: Or if all you need is a router/firewall machine you could try out ipcop which is a pure fw/router software linux distribution.
09:45	<La_PaRCa>	!dma

09:46	<asdx>	RemyLaptop: me
09:46	<asdx>	if i know
09:46	<slackern>	vars_: thats what i used before and it was working fine for over a year here until i felt lucky and went for a dapper install on the router :)
09:46	<slackern>	vars_: No how did you do?
09:47	<slackern>	edulix: you could try starting 'sudo -i' then doing '/bin/echo 4 >	/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling'
09:48	<RemyLaptop>	asdx - never mind, I have to go out now :-)  thanks anyway
09:48	<asdx>	k
09:48	<asdx>	:P
09:48	<edulix>	slackern: but in that case I'm changing to root user. what I want is something I can then configure in /etc/sudoers to let edulix user execute without even asking a password
09:49	<asdx>	anytime
09:49	<slackern>	edulix: ahh maybe make a bashscript for it and run that with sudo?
09:49	<polpak>	edulix: there's examples of how to do that in the man page
09:50	<vars_>	i have 4 videos that are all linked together on a local that i was going to burn to a disk 170 mb no prob.  i've been working on getting my old laptop cdr to burn and it craped out on me    about a week ago i broke one of the pins in my other cdr    and at about 11:00 i had the idea that hey i might be able to make my own web server
09:50	<vars_>	i'm nuts
09:50	<thenetduck>	hey whats the command to edit your source list
09:50	<edulix>	slackern: that's funny, because that is exactly what I was doing in the beguining, executing in a bash script
09:50	<slackern>	vars_: hehe, theres nothing like fixing a problem with another problem and then another :)
09:50	<vars_>	yeah
09:51	<vars_>	170 mb
09:51	<vars_>	f*
09:51	<slackern>	vars_: so what you need is to move a 170mb file to another machine to burn?
09:51	<edulix>	fixed, someone in #bash told me a solution
09:51	<edulix>	sudo bash -c "/bin/echo 3 >	/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling"
09:52	<slackern>	edulix: ahh nice

09:52	<thenetduck>	i think the source files don't work ?
09:52	<thenetduck>	how do delete them...
09:52	<slackern>	thenetduck: it should be in /etc/apt/sources.list
09:52	<polpak>	thenetduck: edit /etc/apt/sources.list

09:54	<dac9cccc>	ok
09:54	<asdx>	dac9cccc: both are mail servers
09:54	<asdx>	i think

10:15	<polpak>	alsa: to either start or shutdown for those runlevels
10:15	<jerware>	for some reason it's using the old version of gcc

10:23	<xbmodder_lappy>	E: Couldn't find package build-essential
10:23	<erik_m>	in synaptic package manager got settings >	reps
10:23	<xbmodder_lappy>	this is a headless
10:23	<KDEfanboy>	any easy way to get the aRts plugin for xine?
10:23	<polpak>	xbmodder_lappy: you need to change /etc/sources.list
10:24	<xbmodder_lappy>	add what...
10:24	<polpak>	xbmodder_lappy: err /etc/apt/sources.list
10:24	<polpak>	!sources

10:24	<polpak>	xbmodder_lappy: get the "Official sources.lists"
10:24	<aftertaf>	anyon hot on migrating root fs to evms?
10:24	<polpak>	xbmodder_lappy: or probably more likely, comment the CD repository and uncomment the main repo

10:26	<brn>	Hello:  Does anyone here have an Epson C88 printer?
10:26	<polpak>	sandy16: if they're not in a terminal window I'm not sure you can
10:26	<Taru>	How do I make Amarok play MP3s?
10:27	<Taru>	Apparently it won't play any of my Mp3s...
10:27	<polpak>	sandy16: if they're in X and have a gui terminal open you can send messages with write
10:27	<spikeb>	!mp3
10:27	<ubotu>	mp3 is, like, a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
10:27	<nn04>	lol, erik youll never guess why apt-get wasnt working, and your gonna wanna hit me when i tell ya :-D
10:28	<erik_m>	ok nn04 lol ??
10:28	<sandy16>	polpak: somebody has suggested me to use "xmessage" but it is not working from a remote terminal
=== olive is now known as olive_
10:28	<nn04>	was typing apt-get install, needed to type sudo apt-get install
=== olive_ is now known as olive
10:28	<erik_m>	8-) lol no worries :) you got it sorted the main thing
10:28	<erik_m>	when im running a few things in apt-get i run sudo su first to put me in root
10:29	<erik_m>	dont need sudo then
10:29	<sandy16>	polpak: are you about to suggest me the write command in bash?
10:29	<erik_m>	but remember to exit when ur done root
10:29	<vmadmin>	hey
10:29	<polpak>	sandy16: write works yes
10:29	<linuxneophyte>	mp3
10:29	<vmadmin>	what does a encrypte file system mean in real terms
10:29	<nn04>	still having a problem with make-jpkg tho
10:29	<erik_m>	cant find package ?
10:30	<polpak>	vmadmin: means the filesystem is encrypted
10:30	<brn>	Where can I find a driver (or better yet, the escape-sequences) for an Epson C88 printer?
10:30	<vmadmin>	polpak: how you write read and exe to an excrpted file system please
10:31	<polpak>	vmadmin: you don't.. You have to have the kernel do it for you
10:31	<vmadmin>	encrypted
10:31	<KDEfanboy>	i hope i won't have to compile the aRts plugin for Xine to get it.. maybe there's a version in an official respository somewhere?
10:31	<erik_m>	nn04 whats the problem with the make-jpkg package ?
10:31	<linuxneophyte>	I can't remember how to ask ubotu a question...
10:31	<polpak>	vmadmin: typically the kernel is configured to know that the filesystem is encrypted, and when it mounts it initially it will prompt for a password. If you don't have the right password it cannot be mounted (read, etc)
10:32	<polpak>	vmadmin: it can still be wiped.. but the data is protected from unauthorized reading
10:32	<nn04>	cant find it
10:32	<nn04>	sorry was running a quick search but yea it cant find the make-jpkg package
10:32	<erik_m>	brn : i think you can setup epson printers in system >	admin >	printing
10:32	<vmadmin>	polpak ; i saw this how to here http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Encrypted_Filesystem might give it a try
10:33	<erik_m>	nn04 try http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto to add more reps
10:33	<polpak>	vmadmin: make sure you have backups of your data.. if you screw it up, you will have a hard/impossible time repairing it ;p
10:33	<vmadmin>	polpak; its on bb 5-10
10:33	<rencrash>	is there a way that i could backup my ubuntu settings and apps that i have installed ont it so if i had to redo it i dont need to redo everything?
10:33	<vmadmin>	polpak: if you look at url its a clean start
10:34	<erik_m>	might be the package is in univers multiverse etc and ur source list doesnt include those reps
10:34	<nn04>	o ic, will try that, be back in 5
10:34	<KenSentMe>	In Nautilus i've connected to Samba shares, but in Firefox the shares are not connected. How can i make sure that i can access my files on those shares in Firefox?
10:34	<polpak>	vmadmin: ok then. have fun =)
10:34	<erik_m>	kl gl with it nn04
10:34	<jerware>	is there a way to have module-assistant to use my latest version of gcc?
10:34	<jerware>	like the one it is pointing to alreay?
10:35	<vmadmin>	polpak: i will :)
10:35	<jerware>	and not the old version?
10:35	<mindframe>	alguien sabe cual es el canal de ubuntu en espaol????
10:35	<linuxneophyte>	How does one ask Ubotu a questio?
10:35	<qzzhong>	
10:36	<vmadmin>	polpak: say i get it up and running then install vmware that might be another story?
10:36	<mindframe>	alguien sabe cual es el canal de ubuntu en espaol????
10:36	<brn>	eric_m:  Thanks but I have tried that.  The printer works with an 'alternate' driver but features are missing.  I think I goofed when I bought the critter but here I am.
10:36	<jerware>	qzzhong:  this is america. speak english
10:36	<polpak>	vmadmin: if linux is the hosting OS you should be fine
10:36	<mindframe>	somebody knows how is de ubuntu channel in spanish?
10:37	<vmadmin>	polpack: yes its bb 5-10 server
10:37	<erik_m>	brn there is a linux driver for epson out there will have a quick look
10:37	<linuxneophyte>	jerware: While I agree that typing in a foreign language isn't useful, perhaps you could be a little more PC about it.  And who's to say any of us are in America?
10:37	<nn04>	lol sweet it worked, didnt realize that i didnt enable all of the repositories

10:38	<hyphenated>	linuxneophyte: you just send a private message to ubotu
10:38	<mindframe>	ok, thanks!!
10:38	<erik_m>	yeah most ppl skip over the reps hihi
10:38	<nn04>	thanks a lot erik, owe you one
10:38	<jerware>	linuxneophyte:  :P
10:38	<erik_m>	its ok
10:38	<asdx>	how can i block www.somesite.com access in some computer of my network?
10:39	<linuxneophyte>	Thanks hyphenated.
10:39	<polpak>	asdx: depends on how your network is configured
10:39	<erik_m>	brn u still about ?
10:39	<asdx>	polpak: it's a basic configuration
10:40	<polpak>	asdx: define "basic"
10:40	<hyphenated>	asdx: there's no 'basic' solution. the simplest is to add www.somesite.com to your /etc/hosts file
10:40	<hyphenated>	with an IP address that doesn't work. but that's a crap way
10:40	<bigfoot1>	i can't access ubuntuforums.org. anybody else with this problem?
10:40	<polpak>	hyphenated: he wants to prevent access from a different computer
10:40	<asdx>	yeah
10:40	<hyphenated>	ok, so add it in that machine's /etc/hosts file
10:41	<brn>	eric_m:  I know I stumbled when I bought the Epson.  I never considered that they would sell a printer that could not print.  I am mortified. Epson "Customer Service" is dissapointng.  The thing works but...
10:41	<asdx>	the other machine has windows
10:41	<polpak>	asdx: windows has a hosts file
10:41	<erik_m>	brn http://www.avasys.jp/english/linux_e/dl_ink.html
10:41	<erik_m>	might help ya a bit :))
10:41	<hyphenated>	if it's worth your time, you'd install a proxy, and force other machines to use the proxy by blocking direct access to the internet
10:41	<asdx>	heh
10:41	<sandy16>	linuxneophyte: hey can u suggest me a method to send a messge to a user (loggedin at GUI) and me using a remote terminal connection
10:41	<bigfoot1>	www.ubuntuforums.org <--- can anybody access this site, or is it just me?
10:41	<polpak>	hyphenated: or if he's natting, he can block it with iptables
10:41	<erik_m>	brn : cant mind what model ya said but it might be in there
10:42	<asdx>	i'm natting
10:42	<bigfoot1>	http://www.ubuntuforums.org <--- can anybody access this site, or is it just me?
10:42	<asdx>	how can i do with iptables?
10:42	<bigfoot1>	sorry
10:42	<bigfoot1>	for dbl post
10:42	<polpak>	asdx: you're natting with your linux box?
10:42	<asdx>	yeah
10:42	<autosuggested>	bigfoot1: Apparently there have been a few problems with the site recently.
10:42	<polpak>	asdx: i.e. all the other computers route through the linux box?
10:42	<hyphenated>	asdx: does the site have a fixed address?
10:42	<vmadmin>	polpak: just one last question if you at the end of the url i posted it says after the filesystem is encrypted apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, in my case i will run this script that installs a vmware ready sysyem from here http://www.howtoforums.net/viewtopic.php?t=5   sory for lng question
10:42	<erik_m>	brn : for distro try debian might work (should work) although might not lol
10:42	<autosuggested>	bigfoot1: At least once a week the site seems to be down.
10:42	<asdx>	polpak: yes
10:42	<vmadmin>	look
10:42	<bigfoot1>	autosuggested: is that so?
10:42	<polpak>	hyphenated: you can use a dns name with iptables I think
10:42	<bigfoot1>	i didn't know that, autosuggested
10:43	<asdx>	hyphenated: fixed address?
10:43	<autosuggested>	bigfoot1: It seems to be up at the moment though.
10:43	<lhb>	bigfoot1: works here
10:43	<bigfoot1>	yes, it's working since 5 seconds ago
10:43	<asdx>	i want to know how to block via the mac address
10:43	<bigfoot1>	but it's slov
10:43	<lhb>	indeed
10:43	<bigfoot1>	is there a way to make other websites think that i have a USA ip address
10:43	<bigfoot1>	?

10:44	<ubotu>	vars_: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
10:44	<slackern>	bigfoot1: i think you can have geoip blocking in iptables
10:44	<autosuggested>	bigfoot1: That's about ubuntuforums, not your problem.
10:44	<bigfoot1>	autosuggested: yes. i know. it's a totally differnt question
10:44	<slackern>	bigfoot1: oh nm, i missread :)
10:45	<polpak>	vmadmin: you can try. I don't use vmware.. so I don't know if it'll work

10:47	<erik_m>	tbigfoot1 there are free us proxys out there

10:49	<erik_m>	ok brn just wanted to make sure u seen the message lol good luck
10:49	<bigfoot1>	xbmodder_lappy: what about 25?
10:50	<bigfoot1>	erik_m: why do you want a non-USA ip?
10:50	<xbmodder_lappy>	$25/month and I'll give you .5 mbit/sec of traffic
10:50	<xbmodder_lappy>	bigfoot1, get a VPS
10:50	<xbmodder_lappy>	and setup openVPN
10:50	<erik_m>	bigfoot unless u get a private proxy which will cost , cause free proxys tend to full and loaded and usless for anything needing bandwidth

10:59	<erik_m>	good luck with that :) i sadly know a lot about the ftp server so ask again if ya need help :))
11:02	<erik_m>	i have a connection being shared from ubuntu , i have setup ipmasq and dnsmasq and both running and i put on a dhcp server that works nicely but traffic that is going into the ubuntu box from other computers  gets out but traffic back into the network from inet doesnt ??
11:02	<erik_m>	i think it could be my routing tables but i cant seem to figure why any ideas ?
11:03	<salkot>	maybe you need to NAT?
11:03	<dave__>	hello everybody
11:03	<salkot>	how do you know that traffic from other computers gets out to th einternet?
11:04	<ubuntu_>	Hello
11:04	<ubuntu_>	Is it possible to boot the ubuntu live cd into RAM ?
11:04	<erik_m>	watching the traffic levels in ifconfig ppp0
11:04	<vars_>	hey can somone go to this website 209.181.2.222
11:04	<dave__>	yes checkout the f2 menu
11:05	<erik_m>	not the best way but it should the corresponding data going out and back
11:05	<ubuntu_>	yeah then what
11:05	<vars_>	and how do i make a static ip addres in linux
11:05	<ubuntu_>	it doesnt say anything about load into memory
11:05	<erik_m>	but in trail - /var/log/messages i cant see the returning data
11:05	<salkot>	erik_m, are you sure that you aren't just seeing the data coming in? you might need to turn on forwarding
11:05	<salkot>	with sysctl
11:06	<dave__>	sorry havent got that paticular cd but ?
11:06	<ubuntu_>	sysctl ?
11:06	<animato>	j #xubuntu
11:06	<erik_m>	i added forwarding to sysctl.conf
11:06	<dave__>	it works on slax live cd
11:07	<ubuntu_>	Does anyone know how to boot ubuntu live cd into memory ?
11:07	<OlliK>	can any .bin be converted to .deb?
11:07	<salkot>	erik_m, if it were me, I'd use tcpdump to see exactly what's happening. if forwarding is on, and your computer is doing nat, that's all that should be necessary
11:08	<ubuntu_>	DOES ANYBODY KNOW ?!
11:08	<erik_m>	alkot lol i never actualy thought about tcpdump lol , cheers ill see whats happening :)
11:09	<animato>	does xubuntu have an automatic update manager like gnome does?
11:09	<ubuntu_>	anybody know how to load ubuntu live cd into memory
11:09	<erik_m>	done all this caper before but with the output being an amateur radio packet radio network  lol

11:32	<Aap>	somebody can help me?
11:32	<aftertaf>	brn, better not to. IMHO. why you trying? better to build from source if no debs available
11:33	<rencrash>	aftertaf,  i know just wondering if you would recomend one... for ubuntu
11:33	<aftertaf>	ive never done it, so i guess im just taking up irc realestate for nothing ;)
11:33	<apokryphos>	brn: /msg ubotu rpm
11:33	<apokryphos>	brn: though, what are you trying to install with rpm?
11:34	<mimihu88>	#ubuntu
11:34	<samuel_>	is Suse taking over ubuntu on distrowatch?
11:34	<samuel_>	why
11:34	<apokryphos>	samuel_: it's gaining on it quite quickly, I think, yes :)
11:34	<brn>	aftertaf:  Thanks.  I just downloaded (hopefully) a driver for a brand-new Epson printer.  The only option was RPM.
11:34	<apokryphos>	suse 10.1 was recently released

11:35	<samuel_>	no
11:35	<rencrash>	thanks blue-frog

11:35	<apokryphos>	there are different distributions for different needs and trends
11:35	<samuel_>	I like ubuntu
11:35	<apokryphos>	good
11:35	<samuel_>	i just wish it had kde intergrated into it
11:35	<blue-frog>	samuel_ then it is the best for you..
11:35	<blue-frog>	samuel_ use kubuntu then
11:35	<apokryphos>	samuel_: install kubuntu-desktop

11:37	<Aap>	i did that
11:37	<apokryphos>	or go to gnome-volume-settings (or whatever it is you guys have :P)
11:37	<Aap>	nothing on mute

12:07	<johannes_erik>	brn did u install CUPS ?

12:08	<ompaul>	johannes_erik, have you set up routes for the traffic to find the outside world
12:08	<rencrash>	how do i give apt-get root rights ?
12:08	<ompaul>	rencrash, again I say :-)  rencrash, sudo apt-get install PACKAGE
12:08	<vmadmin>	hello
12:09	<johannes_erik>	ompaul : hi , i have and still no go
12:09	<vmadmin>	ompaul: can I pick your brain for a sec please
12:09	<ompaul>	rencrash, did you understand that? >>>>	sudo apt-get install Package<<
12:09	<rencrash>	yes thanks you ompaul
12:09	<ompaul>	vmadmin, you know the gig ask the channel if I know I pitch in
12:10	<vmadmin>	ompaul; ok will do
12:10	<ompaul>	johannes_erik, and the gateway is known to the down stream machines
12:10	<brn>	johannes:  As far as I know I do have CUPS.  I found (thanks to another respondent here) a site in Japan that seems to offer the exact driver for my exact model of Epson printer.  I have downloaded both the RPM and "source" (I think) and haven't tried either yet.  "News at eleven" as they say on TV.
12:11	<ompaul>	brn, thats what you say when it works :-)
12:11	<johannes_erik>	i was the other respondant , im using a diffrent machine now (nbetwork probs)
12:11	<johannes_erik>	but yeah discard the rpm
12:11	<johannes_erik>	your gonna have to go by the source
12:12	<ompaul>	brn, rpm is not your friend, it is not apt to be friendly to your machine
12:12	<brn>	ompau:  You got it there my friend.  I wish I knew what I was doing but I don't.  But yet I stick to Linux and Ubuntu.  Go figure.
12:12	<rencrash>	ompaul thanks again got it up
12:12	<johannes_erik>	jus so ompaul can follow if wants to lol , the drivers r filters and descrips to go with CUPS for epson printers
12:12	<ompaul>	rencrash, there is a "driver Section" in that applicaiton I pointed to
12:13	<vmadmin>	in the url here i have been asked to make a partitions for boot and swap and addidional partiions for he future, its it ok form this point of view just to make a boot and swap partition now ans resize later? here is the url http://doc.gwos.org/index.php?title=Encrypted_Filesystem&redirect=no
12:13	<ubuntu_>	!usb
12:13	<ubotu>	parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ubuntu_
12:14	<johannes_erik>	brn jus checking the source see if i can help ya compile it
12:15	<ompaul>	vmadmin, why on earth do you want an encrypted filesystem, and there is something on the Ubuntu Wiki about that afik https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EncryptedFilesystemHowto?highlight=%28encrypted%29%7C%28filesystem%29
12:15	<ompaul>	vmadmin, and set all your partitions up first
12:16	<vmadmin>	ompaul: i asked a questions its ubuntu related and now you are asking me whay on earth? its not fair its seems I canoot do anything correct
12:16	<brn>	johannes:  THanks!  I have never had luck with gcc.  Getting old, I admit that I would rather just grab a binary.
12:17	<killercacti>	how might I search through the list of packages via cli? grep some list that is downloaded with apt-get I'm guessing?
12:17	<phenom>	Can I ask an experinced C++ programmer a question in IM? (Deald with 11 lines of code)
12:17	<ompaul>	vmadmin, okay, I gave you the faq on it, the only time you want an encrypted filesystem is if you have peoples creditcard details on it, wages or state secrets cos you will have a lot of problems trying to recover if anything goes wrong
12:17	<johannes_erik>	brn yeah but its always good to go from source ! harder but better! :)
12:18	<DBO>	not to mention the CPU and speed overhead involved with encryped filesystems
12:18	<vmadmin>	ompaul: its wages and salary items
12:18	<ubuntu_>	um
12:18	<ubuntu_>	how can i use photoshop on ubuntu ?
12:19	<DBO>	ubuntu_, use GIMP...
12:19	<ubuntu_>	but GIMP isnt as good as photoshop
12:19	<brn>	johannes:  I agree but fact is as I get older, patience and memory both fade.  Trust this:  I would rather die with Linux than live with Windows.  But that is just me talking to myself.
12:19	<Ng>	killercacti: apt-cache
12:19	<DBO>	ubuntu_, blashpemy, of course it is!  anyhow, photoshop doesnt work with linux...
12:19	<killercacti>	Ng: I'll check it out, thanks
12:19	<tbf>	how can i capture kernel log messages if the notebook freezes on startup but doesn't have a serial port?
12:20	<ubuntu_>	ah crap
12:20	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, apparently older versions of PS (PS 7, I think) run in Wine... but have a go with the gimp, it's better than you might htink
12:20	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, okay so maybe wine / crossover office might help but that is all
12:20	<johannes_erik>	brn u do ./configure
12:20	<johannes_erik>	?
12:20	<Ng>	tbf: you pretty much can't, unless they show up on screen and you can take a picture :/
12:20	<Madpilot>	think, even...
12:20	<ubuntu_>	I LOVE PS7
12:20	<ubuntu_>	only one I use !
12:20	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, less language thanks
12:20	<Ng>	ubuntu_: Codeweavers Crossover can run some versions of Photosop, but you have to buy it
12:20	<tbf>	Ng: damn, i knew linux suxors! ;-D
12:20	<ubuntu_>	ok whats wine and where do i get it
12:20	<ubuntu_>	no man
12:20	<ubuntu_>	this is my first day on linux
12:20	<DBO>	ubuntu_, really, unless you are a REALLY professional photoshopper, gimp can handle you.  GIMP even supports photoshop plugins =)
12:21	<Ng>	tbf: it has nothing to do with linux, laptop manufacturers suck for taking serial ports away :/
12:21	<ubuntu_>	i just got mp3 working feeeeels good
12:21	<DBO>	!wine
12:21	<ubuntu_>	yes im a pro
12:21	<T`>	oh boy!! finally found the problemw hy i can't hibernate
12:21	<ubuntu_>	!wine
12:21	<vmadmin>	ompaul: at leat I have not mentioned the D word?
12:21	<DBO>	!tell ubuntu_ about wine
12:21	<T`>	i changed my partition and the initrd image still has resume=/dev/hda5
12:21	<Mukunda>	Anyone know how I can get a usb joystick device to work?
12:21	<T`>	instead of hda6
12:21	<T`>	!!!
12:21	<ubotu>	T`: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
12:21	<ubuntu_>	I need dreamweaver 8 and notepad ++
12:21	<Mukunda>	I did hope it'd just work out of the box, but noooo.
12:21	<T`>	how do i update the initrd image? (i just pass in the args thru menu.lst now )
12:21	<T`>	anyone know?
12:21	<ompaul>	vmadmin, you have me lost, but lets not go there
12:22	<ubuntu_>	did someone just say buy ?
12:22	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, instead of dw, try Nvu - it's in Ubuntu's repositories.
12:22	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, no you don't
12:22	<vmadmin>	tompaul: thanks for the FAQ
12:22	<ompaul>	vmadmin, :)
12:22	<johannes_erik>	brn in the dir you extracted the src for the printer file
12:22	<johannes_erik>	./configure
12:22	<johannes_erik>	make install
12:22	<tbf>	Ng: why should they built in legacy serial ports if their only use is capturing linux kernel logs, but the notebook features zillions of other ports?
12:22	<ubuntu_>	nvu thankyou
12:22	<I_Love_DRM>	direct ex
12:23	<ubuntu_>	whats it under ?
12:23	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, click on System Administration Synaptic to install software
12:23	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, Applications->Add Applications, just search for nvu
12:24	<Ng>	tbf: some of us need/use serial ports all the time to talk to other hardware :)
12:24	<ubuntu_>	ok thanks
12:24	<ompaul>	Madpilot, one of these days I will remember that one, /me sulks and goes back to his command line ;-)
12:24	<Ng>	tbf: as long as new hardware products are released with serial interfaces, I would not describe a serial port as "legacy", but this is getting a bit off-topic for here
12:24	<ubuntu_>	cause i would switch to linux if I can have dreamweaver 8, PS7 and mozilla lol
12:24	<Mukunda>	Anyone know how I can get a usb joystick device to work?
12:24	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, by 'mozilla', do you mean the browser (Firefox is already installed) or what?
12:25	<johannes_erik>	ull get mozilla ubuntu_ :)
12:25	<spikeb>	ubuntu_: you'll have mozilla :)
12:25	<brn>	Johannes:  Got that so far.   tar,  etc.  No probem there.  But every *nix source file I have tried to compile has crashed.  You gotta know that I am an old "hardware skunk" who programs computers only when absolutely necessary.
12:25	<ubuntu_>	yeah i have mozilla im happy with that
12:25	<ubuntu_>	I also need flash 8
12:25	<ubuntu_>	and i heard flash player 8 is not supported by linux yet !
12:25	<spikeb>	i belive there's a beta of flash 8.5
12:26	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, Macromedia hasn't bothered with Flash 8 for linux yet... we're still stuck w/ 7
12:26	<ubuntu_>	downloading nvu
12:26	<ubuntu_>	ah crap um
12:26	<ubuntu_>	cause im a big web developer
12:26	<ubuntu_>	I need the baseline of multimedia
12:27	<ubuntu_>	god i love linux so far
12:27	<ubuntu_>	so many programs :D
12:27	<ubuntu_>	and its preety fast of the cd !
12:27	<Ng>	!enter
12:27	<ubotu>	Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
12:27	<I_Love_DRM>	im loving it too ubuntu_
12:27	<spikeb>	there is a beta of flash 8.5 for linux, ubuntu_
12:27	<assclown>	im about to strangle kubuntu
12:27	<ubuntu_>	can you link me please
12:27	<spikeb>	ubuntu_: sure let me find something
12:27	<ubuntu_>	!flash 8
12:27	<ubotu>	ubuntu_: parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
12:27	<ubuntu_>	damn lol
12:28	<I_Love_DRM>	Its about time I removed the multiboot part - if only I could get this vpn to work
12:28	<MistaED>	spikeb: there's a flash 8.5 beta? where?
12:28	<spikeb>	i am looking
12:28	<Madpilot>	assclown, want to get a nicer nick, please?
12:28	<spikeb>	they might have closed the public beta, but i didnt hear of that
12:28	<assclown>	are you serious ?
12:28	<Madpilot>	assclown, entirely
12:29	<assclown>	...
12:29	<tbf>	Ng: yup, it's off-topic as this doesn't help me on solving those ACPI vs. SATA or whatver issues
=== assclown is now known as asshat
12:29	<I_Love_DRM>	:/
=== asshat is now known as asshat_
12:29	<spikeb>	MistaED and ubuntu_ : seems the public beta isn't available anymore. sorry
12:29	<vmadmin>	ompaul; very iitresting article i will print it out it isolder the url i gave you but the baiscs are the same ,  many thanks apologies for my silly outbust before
12:29	<ubuntu_>	Im using a live-cd and im installing all this stuff
12:30	<vmadmin>	interesting
12:30	<johannes_erik>	brn sry was away from computer for a sec
12:30	<ubuntu_>	!wine
12:30	<MistaED>	spikeb: to the bittorrent!
12:30	<Madpilot>	asshat_, still not funny. Last warning...
12:30	<johannes_erik>	ok in terminal
=== asshat_ is now known as Jel
=== Jel is now known as Jel_
12:31	<johannes_erik>	brn cd to the directory , #./configure     #make    #make install
12:31	<Jel_>	is this OK ?
12:31	<ubuntu_>	alright i could get used to ubuntu :D
12:32	<tribe>	hi there
12:32	<donald>	hi
12:32	<tribe>	anyone got dapper updated?
12:32	<Madpilot>	Jel_, much better
12:32	<johannes_erik>	brn post back any errors you get on the way :)
12:32	<pvd2006>	when I goto update manager and it loads a new list are these actually going to be installed? Because I have random stuff like stuff for kde but Im running xfce and never installed kde on this system. random stuff like cd browing plugin for konqerer and such.
12:32	<ubuntu_>	ok guys im downloading wine and its a .deb file
12:32	<ubuntu_>	!.deb
12:32	<ubotu>	Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ubuntu_
12:33	<vmadmin>	ompaul: yiu said set up all your partitions first -that means no resizeing in this howto you actaully  install the full syatem later
12:33	<tribe>	cuz i got a segfault on pdfnup program (pdfjam package) even after reinstall it, if anyone can try a simple $ pdfnup file.pdf and tell me if segfaults...
12:33	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, wine is in repos - switch to Synaptic and get it from there
12:33	<Jel_>	for the love of god i cannot figure out why grub refuses to install...
12:33	<ubuntu_>	ok thanks man
12:33	<Jel_>	im about to strange this thing...
12:33	<brn>	johannes:  I have untarred the file in my ~/download directory. are you sure about the syntax #./configure etc?  I will try it
12:33	<ubuntu_>	how can you change the ubunto skin ?
12:33	<ubuntu_>	its to bright its burning my eyes
12:34	<johannes_erik>	i put the # to show that thats the start of a command to type
12:34	<johannes_erik>	dont actualy put the #
12:34	<pvd2006>	ubuntu_ just wondering also what your screen refresh rate is at right now?
12:34	<johannes_erik>	:)
12:34	<ubuntu_>	60
12:34	<ubuntu_>	im feeling dizzy
12:34	<pvd2006>	That isnt too good for your eyes:-\
12:34	<ubuntu_>	im so used to windows
12:34	<Ng>	ubuntu_: system->preferences->theme
12:34	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, System->Prefs->Theme
12:35	<ubuntu_>	what refresh rate do i put it at
12:35	<Madpilot>	ubotu, tell ubuntu_ about fixres
12:35	<ompaul>	ompaul Madpilot, this just arrived in my mail  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases  <-- we soo needed this would !feature be a good name for it?
12:35	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, a little change goes a huge way
12:35	<pvd2006>	anything above 60hz;)
12:35	<ubuntu_>	its 60
12:35	<pvd2006>	hmm
12:35	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, if you are on a live CD really you should wait until you install
12:35	<Madpilot>	ompaul, how about !timetable
12:35	<ubuntu_>	how much space is needed for ubuntu ?
12:35	<ubuntu_>	im trying to resize
12:35	<pvd2006>	ohh, your on live cd alright
12:36	<I_Love_DRM>	im at 60hz too but lcds are different
12:36	<apokryphos>	ubuntu_: default install is about 1.8 gigs
12:36	<ubuntu_>	ok thanks
12:36	<Kamping_Kaiser>	ubotu, you want *more* tehn 2 gig
12:36	<ubotu>	Kamping_Kaiser: Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
12:36	<apokryphos>	ubuntu_: I recommend putting at least 5/6 gigs for / partition
12:36	<Kamping_Kaiser>	preferably 3
12:36	<apokryphos>	if not more
12:36	<ubuntu_>	um ok
12:36	<pvd2006>	ubuntu_ you migh want to make the partition 5-10gigs depending on wether or not you download big files a lot.
12:36	<I_Love_DRM>	ubuntu_, dont use anything less then 6 - I learnt the hard way
12:36	<moonysuny>	how to install a live-cd?
12:36	<ompaul>	Madpilot, that also reason is this, people come in and say "Foo Version New" is out why is that not in Breezy / Dapper etc
12:36	<ubuntu_>	ok ive given it 8GB
12:36	<Madpilot>	ompaul, yeah, I know
12:37	<ubuntu_>	what file system does linux need ?
12:37	<pvd2006>	ext3 is a good choice
12:37	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, ext3 is the default
12:37	<ubuntu_>	ok
12:37	<ubuntu_>	is it a primary partition ?
12:37	<brn>	johannes:  I tried #./ configure.  Didn't work.  Then I tried ./cofigure and it reported "cannot configure executeables".  Bummer!
12:37	<Madpilot>	the installer can do reformatting/partitioning for you
12:37	<pvd2006>	ubuntu yeah
12:37	<ubuntu_>	because i want to run windows and and linux
12:37	<Ng>	brn: have you installed the build-essential package?
12:37	<Madpilot>	ubotu, tell ubuntu_ about dualboot
12:37	<ubuntu_>	and how do i choose which operating system i want to  use at start up
12:38	<ubuntu_>	ah thanks :D
12:38	<pinky>	How shuld I go about reformating this external hard drive so it has ext3 instead of NTFS?
12:38	<johannes_erik>	brn ok :) read back i said that # was a new line indicator , its ok tho :)
12:38	<johannes_erik>	but that is a bummer
12:38	<brn>	??? "build-essential package?
12:38	<I_Love_DRM>	I just did what your wanting to do ubuntu_ - multiboot after reducing a ntfs partition without losing data
12:38	<johannes_erik>	i was going by the fact the was a configure file
12:38	<ubuntu_>	ok
12:38	<pvd2006>	Ubuntu_ if you have windows xp partition that already takes up the full drive then you will have to resize it then create a new primary partition for a ext3 linux partition I think.
12:38	<ubuntu_>	ive made a new partition
12:38	<Madpilot>	ubotu, timetable is <reply>Ubuntu uses a strict timetable for releases, which means that sometimes new releases miss the timetable. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases for more.
12:39	<ubotu>	okay, Madpilot
12:39	<ubuntu_>	yeah
12:39	<ubuntu_>	i have a 30GB partition for windows and 8GB for linux
12:39	<pvd2006>	cool cool
12:39	<I_Love_DRM>	What did you use to make the new partition ???
12:39	<Madpilot>	ubotu, tell ompaul about timetable
12:39	<pvd2006>	looks like your set
12:39	<ubuntu_>	and windows is ntfs and linux is ext3
12:39	<SaLoMoN>	uh
12:39	<SaLoMoN>	ntfs :|
12:39	<ubuntu_>	is that bad ?
12:39	<apokryphos>	ubuntu_: gnu/linux *can* be ext3; reiser is also a popular filesystem format
12:39	<I_Love_DRM>	mines the same 30/8
12:40	<ompaul>	Madpilot,  I was almost finished :-) okay leave it as one only
12:40	<ubuntu_>	hahaha
12:40	<pvd2006>	ubuntu_ you wont be able to write to your ntfs hard drive from linux
12:40	<pvd2006>	with ntfs
12:40	<johannes_erik>	brn ./configure in the directory works here :-o , u sure ur in the pips... dir ?
12:40	<ubuntu_>	there is only 8mb space left on my windows partion
12:40	<pvd2006>	but that is what I have right now
12:40	<pvd2006>	oh lol
12:40	<I_Love_DRM>	What did you use to repartition ubuntu_
12:40	<ubuntu_>	gparted
12:40	<Madpilot>	ompaul, I just edited !timetable slightly
12:40	<pvd2006>	8megabytes?
12:40	<pvd2006>	wow
12:41	<pinky>	How should I go about reformating this external hard drive so it has ext3 instead of NTFS?
12:41	<ubuntu_>	i rezised my windows partion to 30GB from 38GB and made the new partion ext 3
12:41	<pinky>	What utilites are available to wipe NTFS partitions on USB drives?
12:41	<pvd2006>	oh so its about 38gig hard drive than
12:41	<ompaul>	Madkiss, :-) good stuff
12:41	<ubuntu_>	yah
12:41	<apokryphos>	pinky: mkfs.ext3 /dev/location
12:41	<ompaul>	Madpilot, :-) good stuff (tab errors)
12:41	<ubuntu_>	40GB..but yeah 38
12:42	<ubuntu_>	when i get on windows i need to uninstall some crap !
12:42	<brn>	johannes:  (and thank you for your patience) the tar.gz file is in ~/download and the unzipped source is in a subdirectory.  This is where I am at right now.
12:42	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, less langauge please
12:42	<Mukunda>	Anyone know how I can get a usb joystick device to work?
12:42	<apokryphos>	ubuntu_: all of windows, that is.
12:42	<ubuntu_>	oh sorry
12:42	<ubuntu_>	haha :P
12:42	<pvd2006>	Hmm, Ubuntu_ did you create a swap partition?
12:42	<ubuntu_>	no
12:42	<ubuntu_>	whats a swap partion ?
12:42	<pinky>	apokryphos: can I say /dev/sdc to do the whole drive as one partition instead of /dev/sdc1?
12:43	<johannes_erik>	brn ok :) dont worry u will get it installed: ) , ok so in the subdir in a terminal ?
12:43	<pinky>	apokryphos: I currently have a /dev/sdc1 and /dev/sdc2 both of which are NTFS, and both of which I'd like erased.
12:43	<apokryphos>	pinky: hm, I'm not sure. Could go the graphical way to be sure; gparted.
12:43	<pvd2006>	its like virtual memory if you fill up your real memory.
12:43	<pinky>	I only need a /dev/sdc1
12:43	<ubuntu_>	ah ok
12:43	<ubuntu_>	um
12:43	<ubuntu_>	how much for swap then ?
12:43	<I_Love_DRM>	Best thing for new users like me is to leave the free space as it is and let ubuntu setup partition it for you
12:43	<pvd2006>	maybe 512- a gig?
12:43	<ubuntu_>	ok 1GB it is.
12:43	<ubuntu_>	im on a laptop by the way
12:44	<I_Love_DRM>	same lol
12:44	<ubuntu_>	this doesnt interfere with anything does it ?
12:44	<brn>	Johannes:  No terminal.  This is a solo compter, albeit somewhat ancient.
12:44	<I_Love_DRM>	What type of laptop ubuntu_
12:44	<Madkiss>	ompaul: wassabi?
12:44	<apokryphos>	I_Love_DRM: it will automatically shrink the partition?
12:44	<pvd2006>	I couldnt answer that question, :-\
12:44	<apokryphos>	don't recall seeing that option on ubuntu
12:44	<johannes_erik>	brn ok just so i understand , ur using gnome gui ?
12:44	<ubuntu_>	ok guys
12:44	<ubuntu_>	is the file system linux_swap ?
12:44	<johannes_erik>	brn im a bit slow sometimes lol
12:45	<pvd2006>	ubuntu_ yeah fo the swap partition
12:45	<brn>	Johannes:  Yes.  Gnome and Ubuntu 5.10.
12:45	<ubuntu_>	thanks
12:45	<I_Love_DRM>	I just shrunk the ntfs partition with symantec partition magic then ket the Ubuntu setup worry about swap/ext3
12:45	<ubuntu_>	ok
12:45	<ubuntu_>	its applying the changes !
12:45	<ubuntu_>	I got an error !
12:45	<ompaul>	Madpilot, your edit is good, and I got caught with a tab the line preceeding
12:45	<ubuntu_>	but i cant see anything !
12:45	<brn>	...I think I have all the supported packages loaded.
12:46	<richiefrich>	I_Love_DRM, LOL i like the name but not drm
12:46	<pvd2006>	ubuntu_ do you have enough room to create a swap of one gig right now btw?
12:46	<johannes_erik>	ok brn go to apps top left accessory >	terminal
12:46	<ubuntu_>	damn
12:46	<ubuntu_>	um
12:47	<ubuntu_>	i didnt have enough space
12:47	<ubuntu_>	oops
12:47	<ompaul>	!enter
12:47	<ubotu>	Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
12:47	<pvd2006>	haha, thats ok, you can resize the ubuntu partition to 7gigs
12:47	<pvd2006>	linux partition I mean, whatever you want to call it
12:48	<Sandy16>	how to enable root to login through GUI
12:48	<ubuntu_>	ok im being more generous with space
12:48	<pvd2006>	;)
12:48	<Madpilot>	Sandy16, that's really not recommended - or needed...
12:48	<Mukunda>	Ubuntu is a piece of crap, I've been trying for hours to get these dance pads to work, which should just work as usb joysticks, but there are no joystick devices or anything in /dev or /dev/input
12:48	<johannes_erik>	sudo should be enough!
12:48	<brn>	Johannes:  Keep going.  Now I have two terminal windows on the screen.  Is this right?  (You think you're slow?  Try me.)
12:48	<ompaul>	!tell Sandy16 about root
12:48	<ubuntu_>	damn it
12:49	<ompaul>	Sandy16, please read the message from the bot, the url is really what I want you to read
12:49	<ubuntu_>	it keeps failing with the swap !
12:49	<Tedd>	Mukunda: There are quite a few people who would disagree with you. :)
12:49	<johannes_erik>	brn :-) ok now cd right into the dir where files are extracted
12:49	<liquidindian>	Hello.  Does anyone have any tips for performance?  I get a lot of skipped frames when I'm playing video.  It seemed to work slightly better under XP - any advice to maybe stop processes that are running by default and not needed?
12:49	<I_Love_DRM>	ubuntu_, is there anything on the ext3 you made?
12:49	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, you are installing on another machine?
12:49	<ubuntu_>	nope
12:49	<Mukunda>	Tedd: they can disagree all they want, but it won't make the usb joystick devices work.
12:49	<ubuntu_>	there is a previous ext3 with a massive 8MB size :D :P
12:49	<mewino>	ohhhhh
12:50	<mewino>	mola
12:50	<ubuntu_>	ok im going to do one thing at a time
12:50	<Tedd>	Mukunda: This is true. The simple answer would be...if you don't like it, don't use it, don't complain
12:50	<johannes_erik>	brn now #dir   (ignore my # they show a new line, dont actualy type # :)  )
12:50	<brn>	Johannes:  Now I am in the directory wiith hte unzipped printer driver stuff.  Now what?
12:50	<ubuntu_>	guys its not working
12:50	<ompaul>	Mukunda, please reboot when usb fails it helps more times than it does not - devfs is dead and udev can and should work with little effort
12:50	<ubuntu_>	i press apply
12:50	<ubuntu_>	and it does stuff
12:51	<johannes_erik>	brn as u probably know that list all the files , just check to confirm a file called configure is there
12:51	<ubuntu_>	then it refreshes and its back to normal
12:51	<ompaul>	ubuntu_, are you installing from a live CD?
12:51	<johannes_erik>	brn now #./configure
12:51	<ubuntu_>	im not installing
12:51	<ubuntu_>	im changin the partitions from a live cd
12:51	<ubuntu_>	using gparted
12:51	<usuario>	www. chat . com
12:52	<brn>	johannes:  Got it.  Configure appears to be executeable if I understand the color-coding.
12:52	<ubuntu_>	hey also, i have the the dapper drake flight 7 disc
12:52	<Mukunda>	ompaul: done that.
12:52	<ubuntu_>	should I install that ?
12:52	<johannes_erik>	brn it may fail yet any errors ?
12:53	<ubuntu_>	?
12:53	<pinky>	Is ext3 preferable over ext2 on external hard drives as well?
12:53	<Madpilot>	ubuntu_, if you do a Breezy install, you'll be able to update/upgrade that to Dapper when you want to
12:54	<ompaul>	Mukunda, have a poke around here, I don't have one so  am not familar with their workings: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=joystick&fullsearch=Text
12:54	<pvd2006>	Ubuntu_ what type of internet connection do you have ?
12:54	<johannes_erik>	brn will be back in a second
12:54	<Mukunda>	ompaul: I've tried, I'll check that though.
12:54	<OlliK>	how can I add new user to the linux?
12:54	<ubuntu_>	22MBIT
12:54	<pinky>	OlliL: adduser foo
12:54	<pvd2006>	olliK adduser
12:54	<OlliK>	When i try to add user like: sudo adduser name group, it says "The user 'name' does not exist.
=== ubuntu_ is now known as Corey
12:55	<OlliK>	How could it exist becuase I'm just trying to create it? I don't get it
12:55	<pvd2006>	did you say 22mbit?
12:55	<Corey>	yes
12:55	<Corey>	:D
12:55	<mihai>	I have one question. If I upgrade to Dapper using gksudo ... will Avidemux, Azureus, etc still work? I've installed those using Automatix
12:56	<Corey>	22,000kbs
12:56	<OlliK>	Does anyone know how to add a user to linux using adduser-command? I've looked from man adduser and it seems to be just like: "sudo adduser thename thegroup"
12:56	<Corey>	I download at like 2500 kb a second ^_^
12:56	<pvd2006>	Corey, wow.
12:56	<OlliK>	But for me, it says "adduser: The user 'theuser' does not exist."
12:56	<pvd2006>	I wish I had that type of connection.
12:56	<Corey>	its hell cheap
12:56	<kesV>	pinky: yes. I'd say so, since it's entirely possible a read is interrupted on an external drive.
12:56	<Corey>	if you in australia !
12:56	<Corey>	$80 including line rental for telephone !
12:56	<johannes_erik>	brn back , u get anywhere with the ./configure  ?
12:57	<brn>	Johannes:  It reports:  "Checking for C compiler default output... configure: error:  C compiler cannot create executeables"
12:57	<Corey>	so reaaly..its $45 for adsl++2
12:57	<pvd2006>	Corey, that is not bad at all.
12:57	<kesV>	pinky: obviously I meant a write, but you get the idea
12:57	<pvd2006>	Corey, I would would install breezy then update to dapper when you need to or want to.
12:57	<shadow`>	http://sourceforge.net/projects/bloodymary
12:58	<shadow`>	now THAT'S useful
12:58	<I_Love_DRM>	Ill be getting 22mb when I move to brisbane next month.
12:58	<johannes_erik>	brn hmmmmm should be a.out
12:58	<OlliK>	Can anyone help me with "adduser" command?
12:58	<Corey>	well im still new
12:58	<Corey>	so ill just go with breezy badger :d
12:58	<Corey>	:D
12:58	<spikeb>	Corey: great idea
12:58	<pvd2006>	ahhhhh, I am still waiting for FTTP to come to my area so I can get 15Mbit/s
12:59	<mihai>	I have one question. If I upgrade to Dapper using gksudo ... will Avidemux, Azureus, etc still work? I've installed those using Automatix
12:59	<johannes_erik>	brn #sudo apt-get install gcc
12:59	<mihai>	connection problem
12:59	<johannes_erik>	brn to make sure ur gcc is latest
01:00	<Corey>	ok im happy with ubuntu
01:00	<pvd2006>	OlliK: try this
01:00	<I_Love_DRM>	This is the only linux distro that hasn't been fdisk /mbr'd after a week
01:00	<Corey>	so has anybody been able to run photoshop 7 with wine ?
01:00	<pvd2006>	sudo -s then after that just type adduser name group etc...
01:00	<Samuli^>	Corey, Don't ask for too much dude :)
01:00	<brn>	Johannes:  I could compile C source on this computer a long(?) time ago when I had RedHat v.6, but not siince then.
01:00	<spikeb>	Corey: in theory it works
01:00	<pinky>	Corey: Try The GIMP?
01:00	<Corey>	I didnt like the gump
01:01	<Corey>	gimp**
01:01	<Samuli^>	GIMP r0x0r.
01:01	<Samuli^>	And it's free.
01:01	<spikeb>	bah
01:01	<Corey>	haha
01:01	<spikeb>	get used to it, gimp rules
01:01	<pinky>	Corey: Why's that?
01:01	<blue-frog>	corey photoshop works fine with windows...
01:01	<Corey>	Yes I know that but i want to use linux
01:01	<Ng>	Corey: Codeweavers Crossover runs some versions of photoshop if you don't mind paying, but it ought to work ok in recent WINEs I would think
01:01	<johannes_erik>	brn i know the feeling used to run slackware loved that ditro but so akward, but anyway lol u try the spt-get thing ?
01:01	<Ng>	codeweavers seem to feed their changes back in
01:01	<johannes_erik>	*apt-get
01:02	<pinky>	Corey: Have you tried Gimpshop?
01:02	<Corey>	yeah, so wine makes .exe work does it ?
01:02	<Corey>	gimpshop ?
01:02	<Ng>	Corey: some exe's, yeah
01:02	<brn>	Johannes:  I appear to have gcc v 4.0.2 here.
01:02	<Corey>	I used gimp image editor and didnt like it
01:02	<Mukunda>	Well until dapper can take a usb joystick and go out of the box, it's crap.
01:02	<pinky>	Corey: That's why I asked *why* you prefer Photoshop... Gimpshop is made specifically to look and act like Photoshop's interface.
01:02	<Samuli^>	Corey, you don't like it because you're not used to it.
01:02	<spikeb>	gimpshop makes gimp more like photoshop
01:02	<pinky>	It's probably because you are unfamiliar with the GIMP
01:03	<nixuser>	like everyone needs a usb joystick
01:03	<spikeb>	anyone who isn't familiar with gimp probably hates it, PS user or not
01:03	<Corey>	yeah does gimp have ps power ?
01:03	<spikeb>	it's a rather horribly designed interface
01:03	<pinky>	If you could specify beyond "why you don't like it" it would be helpful.
01:03	<Corey>	cause photoshop is a very could package
01:03	<Corey>	good*
01:03	<pvd2006>	whats the command to remove a user again in linux?
01:03	<OlliK>	pvd2006: what does sudo -s do?
01:03	<Corey>	ok so gimpshop ill install :D
01:03	<tomplast>	can anyone tell me how to get a wine menu in gnome as you get in kde?
01:04	<pinky>	Ah, so it *is* the unfamiliarity.
01:04	<pvd2006>	sudo-s takes you to root logon then you can type commands as root.
01:04	<pvd2006>	then you can exit it out
01:04	<blue-frog>	and by the way photoshop is on the way to redefine it's interface as per the GIMP
01:04	<johannes_erik>	brn i had a brainstorm lol try #CC=gcc ./configure
01:04	<rapha>	Hi all! Is it possible to download binaries for Firefox 1.5.0+ *PPC* for Ubuntu *Breezy Badger* somewhere?
01:04	<OlliK>	pvd2006: ok, thanks
01:04	<I_Love_DRM>	as long as gimp does things my old jasc did im happy
01:04	<pvd2006>	np;)
01:04	<spikeb>	rapha: not likely
01:04	<tomplast>	guys?
01:04	<OlliK>	pvd2006: it still says the same
01:04	<rapha>	spikeb: so I'll have to upgrade to Flight 7 if I can't afford compiling it myself?
01:05	<Corey>	where can i find gimpshop ?
01:05	<OlliK>	pvd2006: adduser: The user 'myuser' does not exist.
01:05	<spikeb>	rapha: yes, or wait until dapper stable comes out
01:05	<pvd2006>	ollik, what exactly did you type?
01:05	<Madpilot>	Corey, google - I don't think it's in Ubuntu's repos
01:05	<OlliK>	pvd2006: adduser myuser mygroup
01:05	<Corey>	ah ok
01:05	<OlliK>	pvd2006: and that mygroup exists
01:05	<Corey>	how do i install things from downloads
01:05	<Sandy16>	ompaul: thnx abt the link
01:05	<rapha>	spikeb: That was my plan, but now I'm in a situation where I can't get on with my work due to certain limitations of FireFox 1.0 :-/
01:05	<Corey>	like a deb file ?
01:05	<way2evil>	hi
01:06	<pinky>	Corey: http://freshmeat.net/redir/gimpshop/57360/url_rpm/gimpshop.rpm.torrent
01:06	<spikeb>	rapha: you should be able to compile it, if yo uhave enough space
01:06	<ompaul>	Sandy16, yw
01:06	<pvd2006>	Ollik and this is after you typed sudo -s and then went to the root prompt right
01:06	<pinky>	That's a torrent to the latest GimpSHOP Linux RPM
01:06	<OlliK>	pvd2006: yes
01:06	<Corey>	thanks
01:06	<tomplast>	cant anyone tell me how to get a menu for installed wine applications in gnome?
01:06	<pinky>	Corey: direct link here: http://freshmeat.net/redir/gimpshop/57360/url_mirror/gimpshopbyme.rpm
01:06	<OlliK>	pvd2006: before doing sudo -s, it gave the same answer when I typed: sudo adduser myuser mygroup
01:06	<pvd2006>	That is strange
01:06	<mihai>	it's safe to upgrade to dapper now?
01:07	<Ng>	OlliK: are you literally typing "myuser" or your actual username?
01:07	<OlliK>	Ng: actual username
01:07	<Corey>	thanks pinky
01:07	<way2evil>	i am trying to install ubuntu on a partition with a dual boot of XP and ubuntu wont read the partition. what format does it need to be in? please PM me with reply this chat is filled
01:07	<rapha>	spikeb: no way. This is a 2001 iBook Clamshell with a 366MHz or so G3 and about 300MB of free disk space. Do you think it might be feasible to change the apt sources.list to Dapper and try an apt-get remove firefox && apt-get install firefox?
01:07	<lukasz20>	haloo
01:07	<Corey>	how do install thoe ?
01:07	<spikeb>	rapha: that would probably break things
01:07	<spikeb>	rapha: if it helps any, i use dapper on a mac mini with zero problems.
01:07	<brn>	Johannes:  Are you sure about the syntax?  #CC?  I will try it since it sure can't hurt.
01:08	<johannes_erik>	no # lol
01:08	<Madpilot>	rapha, masses of things depend on Firefox - you'd break things badly trying to just install FF from Dapper...
01:08	<johannes_erik>	brn its just the way ive always written commands lol
01:08	<Corey>	how do install files ?
01:08	<rapha>	Madpilot: I _would_ let it pull in the dependencies...
01:09	<spikeb>	Madpilot: any plans to abstract that out a bit so things don't depend on FF, but just <a browser>	?
01:09	<Madpilot>	ubotu, tell Corey about alien
01:09	<Corey>	also, is the HD version of ubuntu faster than livecd ?
01:09	<rapha>	spikeb: yeah, gives me kind of a fuzzy feeling. But that probably means that our intern won't have her PC available to her today :)
01:09	<spikeb>	rapha: haha
01:09	<Madpilot>	Corey, the installed version is much faster
01:09	<Corey>	:D
01:09	<pinky>	Corey: You can use alien to install RPM files.
01:09	<Madpilot>	spikeb, no idea - you'd have to ask the developers
01:09	<pvd2006>	how well does alien word?
01:10	<Corey>	ok thanks
01:10	<pvd2006>	work*
01:10	<brn>	Johannes:  Yep.  Tried it all ways.  Same result.  But we have tried and I am grateful for your help anyway.  Getting late (early) here in California and there are other things to do.  Thanks again.
01:10	<rapha>	spikeb: is there a chance I will be able to upgrade from Flight 7 to Dapper Drake Final when it is released without have to reinstall again?
01:10	<spikeb>	rapha: yeah, i believe so
01:10	<spikeb>	rapha: that's actually the assumption i'm working on for my install
01:10	<johannes_erik>	brn ok sry , seems gcc is at fault :(
01:10	<Corey>	is there a better messenger than gaim ?
01:10	<spikeb>	Corey: define better
01:10	<johannes_erik>	brn good night/good morning , only noon here in scotland yet tho :)
01:11	<rapha>	spikeb: kay, thx!
01:11	<tribe>	i use kopete under kde :}
01:11	<Corey>	um
01:11	<Corey>	better looking and more features
01:11	<spikeb>	Corey: what sort of features?
01:11	<HymnToLife>	Like the non-ability to send files via MSN :p
01:12	<christo_>	Somewhat new to ubuntu, trying to install xchat on Dapper, apt-get says 'Couldnt' find package xchat'. Is this because it hasn't been packaged yet for Dapper?
01:12	<Corey>	um msn 7.5
=== Tedd is now known as Tedd|School
01:12	<brn>	Johannes:  Yes.  I sometimes wish there was somone my age around to explain the mystery/misery of the 'C' language and it's compiler to me.  Sadly, most of them are dead now.
01:12	<spikeb>	well
01:12	<Corey>	ok i downloaded the alien.tar.gz
01:12	<spikeb>	Corey: aMSN has many more MSN features.
01:12	<Corey>	i opened it and there is all this stuff um..
01:12	<Madpilot>	Corey, just install alien thru Synaptic
01:12	<christo_>	r
01:13	<Corey>	ok how just select it ?
01:13	<Madpilot>	Corey, System->Admin->Synaptic Package Manager
01:13	<bimberi>	christo_: it's in the universe repository
01:13	<johannes_erik>	brn we struggle finding ppl who know about computers up here in the highlands :D
01:13	<bimberi>	!tell christo_ about universe
01:13	<Madpilot>	Corey, delete the file you just downloaded, you don't need that for alien
01:13	<Corey>	oh ok
01:14	<brn>	johannes:  Save just a wee dram of that ancient hand-made malt beverage for me.  If I don't make it to Scotland, drink it in memory.
01:14	<pvd2006>	Oh yeah, had a question. When I update and get a list of all this kde stuff on the update list is it going to install that stuff? I have random kde stuff like browsing cds through konqeruer and such things.
01:15	<pvd2006>	I have xubuntu, so I dont know why all this extra kde stuff is on there.
01:15	<johannes_erik>	brn :)) will do, hope you make it over here at some point
01:15	<Corey>	lol i will have to install this all over agagin
01:15	<Corey>	but i want to fully test so its going good :)
=== tribe is now known as tribe`afk
01:16	<Corey>	how do i install files with alien now ?
01:17	<YoussefAssad>	I have an odd problem. When I bring up a network interface, gtk applications can't be started
01:17	<Madpilot>	need sleep - later, all
01:17	<trym>	is there an easy way of getting svn to support https ?
01:17	<johannes_erik>	All : I am trying to get my ubuntu box to basicaly bridge a ppp0 and eth0 connection , how best would i go about this ?
01:17	<Corey>	how do i install .rpm ?
01:17	<pvd2006>	johannes, you want to run a adsl connection?
01:18	<johannes_erik>	i got an adsl connection , typed up some scripts for hotplug and it runs nicely on ppp0
01:18	<HymnToLife>	johannes_erik>	you mean to share the PPP connection over the network ?
01:18	<johannes_erik>	tested it on apt-get seems fine
01:18	<johannes_erik>	HymToLife basically what i want to do! :)
01:19	<HymnToLife>	johannes_erik>	then install Firestarter
01:19	<HymnToLife>	and dhcp3-server
01:19	<shadedpast>	sup all
01:19	<johannes_erik>	its going into a router after that so im not to fussed about dhcp (although ive already set dhcp up 8-)  )
01:19	<HymnToLife>	in fact, install dhcp3-server first
01:19	<Corey>	how do i installe .rpm ? i downloaded and installed alien
01:19	<HymnToLife>	then if you have a router it should do the sharing
01:20	<Nookie^>	Corey: u need to make a deb package
01:20	<Corey>	ok how ?
01:20	<HymnToLife>	Corey>	alien filename.rmp
01:20	<Nookie^>	Corey: alien -d packagename.rpm
01:20	<Corey>	ok
01:20	<ompaul>	!alien
01:20	<ubotu>	alien is, like, totally, a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
01:21	<Corey>	it said
01:21	<johannes_erik>	ill try explain :)   |INET USBMODEM| -->	|UBUNTU BOX| -->	|ROUTER| -->	|NETWORK|
01:21	<Corey>	i must run as root ?
01:21	<pvd2006>	sudo alien -d packagename.rpm
01:21	<ompaul>	!tell corey about alien
01:21	<usuario>	hola a todos
01:21	<ompaul>	!es
01:21	<johannes_erik>	HymnToLife thats about the best i can explain lol :)
01:21	<ubotu>	Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
01:21	<HymnToLife>	johannes_erik>	the router is useless here
01:21	<johannes_erik>	how ?
01:22	<Corey>	um
01:22	<Corey>	i did that
01:22	<HymnToLife>	because your Ubuntu box will do the job
01:22	<Corey>	and it came up with usage :sudo
01:22	<Corey>	and all this other stuff
01:22	<ompaul>	Corey, read the message from the bot
01:22	<ompaul>	!tell Corey about paste
01:22	<johannes_erik>	ahh forgot to mention its a wireless router and most my network is wireless
01:22	<Corey>	usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v
01:22	<Corey>	usage: sudo [-HPSb]  [-p prompt]  [-u username|#uid] 
01:22	<Corey>	            { -e file [...]  | -i | -s | <command>	}
01:22	<usuario>	algunos espaoles???

01:22	<ubotu>	Hispanohablantes: Por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
01:22	<Corey>	oh wait
01:22	<Corey>	it said illegal option -d
01:23	<pvd2006>	Corey, be careful not to paste too much stuff into the chat directly;)
01:23	<Corey>	sudo illegal ption -d
01:23	<Corey>	is that private data ?
01:23	<HymnToLife>	johannes_erik>	I have very little eperience with Wireless
01:23	<Nookie^>	alien --help
01:23	<pvd2006>	na, iuts just there are so many people it can flood.
01:23	<johannes_erik>	HymnToLife the ubuntu box is in the internet port on my router which means the rest of the network see the router as the inet gateway although it only forwards to the inet port which is the ubuntu machine
01:24	<Corey>	what do i want to generate to ?
01:24	<HymnToLife>	johannes_erik>	so ann you need is Firestarter
01:24	<johannes_erik>	so in effect all the ubuntu box needs to do is "bridge" (terminiology ??) the two
01:24	<Corey>	its rpm what do i want to make it ?
01:24	<HymnToLife>	to setup the connection sharing on the eth
01:25	<pvd2006>	Yeah I dont understand why sudo doesnt work with some commands?
01:25	<johannes_erik>	i heard about firestarter , but can it run on a base system ? no X or gui ?
01:25	<johannes_erik>	i thought it was an X app , im posiabley wrong!
01:25	<HymnToLife>	no, it's a GUI for iptables
01:25	<pvd2006>	sudo alien -d packagename.rpm doesnt work Corey?
01:25	<h3sp4wn>	<johannes_erik>: You don't really need firestarted for such a simple case
01:25	<HymnToLife>	you'll have to set your iptables rule manually then
01:25	<HymnToLife>	!iptables
01:25	<FliesLikeABrick>	#iptables
01:26	<johannes_erik>	HymnToLife ive done my iptables but it just dont wanna go :'(
01:26	<h3sp4wn>	"/sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE"
01:26	<johannes_erik>	HymnToLife i could be editing my iptables wrong , is there a CLI editor ?
01:27	<Corey>	in terminal how do i specify where the file is ?
01:27	<Corey>	like the file i want to unpack is on the desktop
01:27	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn hi , i tried that still it wont route the traffic
01:27	<h3sp4wn>	net/ipv4/ip_forward=1 needs to be in /etc/sysctl.conf
01:27	<pvd2006>	corey cd ~/Desktop I believe
01:27	<Corey>	sudo alien -g file.rpm
=== jimmy____ is now known as jimMmy
01:27	<Corey>	ok
01:27	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn yip added that too
01:27	<ompaul>	Corey, you do realise your risking breaking your machine
01:27	<Corey>	why ?
01:28	<ompaul>	!alien
01:28	<ubotu>	[alien]  a program to convert RPMs to DEBs. Its use is discouraged, as it could create serious problems. Website: http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/
01:28	<pvd2006>	Corey, Yeah I dont know why someone recommended alien ive heard problems with it.
01:28	<Corey>	... o
01:28	<pvd2006>	Corey, what are you trying to install?
01:28	<Corey>	how do I instal rpm files then ?
01:28	<ompaul>	Corey, you don't just grab some random piece of software and think "I'll have this"
01:28	<Corey>	gimpshop
01:28	<h3sp4wn>	johannes_erik: Can you get a shell on the router ?
01:29	<pvd2006>	Corey, do you have the link?
01:29	<ompaul>	Corey, you dont do rpm you do debs specifically deb files for Ubuntu
01:29	<Corey>	what are the file extensions i can install  ? tar.gz ?
01:29	<Corey>	deb um
01:29	<pvd2006>	ompaul, I dont think they have .deb its a tar.gz most likely.
01:29	<Corey>	its gimpshop pro
01:29	<Corey>	just a second
01:29	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn yip thats ok and i can see the trafic reach the machine with tcpdump but it doesnt get passed on
01:30	<pvd2006>	so hes gonna have to learn how to install programs the fun way:)
01:30	<ompaul>	pvd2006, so he can get that, I am not being use case specific
01:30	<pvd2006>	Corey, its not hard at all to install a tar.gz
01:30	<FliesLikeABrick>	alien should usually be the last choice for installing
01:30	<johannes_erik>	pvd2006 u mean install programs the REAL way :))
01:30	<pvd2006>	hehe
01:30	<Corey>	ok um well jsut wait ill find the gimpshop site
01:31	<h3sp4wn>	johannes_erik: Have you tried source nat instead of masquarading
01:31	<Corey>	which one do i download for gimpshop ?
01:31	<Corey>	http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294
01:31	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn never heard of "source nat" , hows that work ?

01:36	<corey_>	i installed the plugin, its not working
01:36	<Corey>	how do i install deb ?
01:37	<pvd2006>	Corey, It just seems youll need to install some dependencies before you install that .deb package though
01:37	<johannes_erik>	corey_ is there an error or does it not do anything ?
01:37	<corey_>	no error, just doesnt work
01:37	<Corey>	install some depenedices ok

02:07	<johannes_erik>	the packets reached the ubuntu box but went no further

02:17	<hyphenated>	j2daosh: if you want, you can run 'sudo updatedb' (which will take a while) and then run locate again
02:17	<Evanescent>	it's just configuring so i'll find out in a minute or 3
02:17	<j2daosh>	it dont even take 3 seconds... right after i hit enter on the command "locate qt-libs" it brings me back to the prompt
02:17	<Evanescent>	66% complete
02:17	<hyphenated>	j2daosh: then your 'locate' database will be nice and fresh. and probably just as snappy
02:17	<j2daosh>	hyphenated, just did that
02:18	<atomical>	What do I need to capture say realplayer streams im watching, or audio streams???
02:18	<j2daosh>	hyphenated, can i use wild cards during a locate?
02:19	<atomical>	and whats the most secure/best proxy server to use?
02:19	<j2daosh>	i cant seem to get the qt software loaded and its really pissing me off because it cant find this stupid qt-libs file/directory
02:19	<hyphenated>	j2daosh: you can use a regular expression
02:19	<Tenshi>	whenever I try to do a connect-to-server to a samba share, it keeps telling me that smb://user@server/share  is an invalid url.  Is there a samba plugin or another package that I need to add to  nautilus to add smb:// support to it?
02:20	<j2daosh>	what is a regular expression again? in lamens terms...

02:20	<jesse_>	Hello I have a really bizzare problem. Ubuntu (hoary) has somehow reversed the recognition of my dvd player and cd player.
02:20	<j2daosh>	ahh
02:20	<j2daosh>	gotcha
02:20	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: no, that's a glob
02:20	<jesse_>	What I mean is that when I type eject hdd ina command line, the cd ejects instead of the dvd.
02:21	<atomical>	h3sp4wn, does it run on BSD?
02:21	<Tenshi>	hyphenated: depends on the context
02:21	<atomical>	wait yeah it does.
02:21	<atomical>	I think
02:21	<h3sp4wn>	atmical: BSD or linux
02:21	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: nope, they are distinctly different
02:21	<Ng>	jesse_: they will appear in the order the kernel sees them. are they USB drives by any chance?
02:21	<hyphenated>	'*.mp3' is a valid glob, but not a valid regular expression
02:21	<j2daosh>	tenshi, all you should need to do is go to places (bottom on the toolbar) network servers, then go from there
02:21	<atomical>	capture card is all I need to capture and record realplayer streams?
02:22	<jesse_>	no they are not usb drives
02:22	<Tenshi>	j2daosh, no ... says it's invalid even when I try to browse.  This began as soon as I dist-upgraded to dapper
02:22	<Tenshi>	"invalid url sbm://"
02:22	<Tenshi>	er... "smb:/"
02:22	<Ng>	jesse_: hmm. I wouldn't expect the order to change after install then. I'm not sure there's anything you can do to change the order back unfortunately.
02:22	<j2daosh>	oh... i dont have dapper :) imma wait till its alittle more stable
02:22	<j2daosh>	tenshi... there is a new dapper room though
02:22	<jesse_>	Ng: can the kernal recognize them differently then what is in fstab
02:23	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: ask in #ubuntu+1 , they might know the answer to that one
02:23	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, k, will do that
02:23	<atomical>	dapper has been good on mylaptop
02:23	<atomical>	no probs
02:23	<jesse_>	I mean my dvd is mounted to hdd
02:23	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn i just connected the machine in question and tried to ssh to it and i get connection refused
02:23	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, curious though, how are you differentiating a glob from a regular expression?
02:23	<jesse_>	but when i eject hdd
02:23	<hyphenated>	I'll try dapper in a couple of weeks
02:23	<jesse_>	then my cd player ejects
02:23	<h3sp4wn>	johannes_erik: You need to install openssh-server
02:24	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: in many ways. the meaning of * and ? are very different between a glob and a regular expression
02:24	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn ok will try that
02:25	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: man 7 glob, man 7 regex ;-)
02:25	<hyphenated>	those won't actually make it clearer ;-)
02:25	<Tenshi>	I thought the syntax of a regular expression was completely contextual based on the language
02:25	<Tenshi>	interpreter, etc ...
02:26	<hyphenated>	in general, globs are for filenames, and regexes are for text. things that interpret them have all sorts of syntaxes around the actual regex
02:26	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn ok installed now but its asking for a password i dont know lol , new can of worms has been opend i thinks lol
02:27	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, sounds awfully like a matter of context to me :)
02:27	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: yeah, but you can't use a glob when it wants a regular expression
02:27	<hyphenated>	they just won't work
02:27	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: You just login with the same username and password that you use to login from the console
02:27	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, again ... it depends on the context ;)
02:27	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn just ignor that last bit i got it , just me being daft
02:28	<Tenshi>	some globs ARE valid regular expressions
02:28	<twopeak>	hello, I have a problem making my third harddrive work. I see it in gPart (and formatted it to FAT32), but when I try to "enable" it in Administration>Disks then it won't work.
02:28	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: naw, a glob to match mp3 files would be '*.mp3', a regex to match them would be '^.*\.mp3$'
02:28	<hyphenated>	and the meaning of the '*' is different for them too
02:28	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, only in perl style syntax
02:29	<Tenshi>	:)
02:29	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: nope, perl-style syntax would be different yet again
02:29	<Tenshi>	though I haven't worked with perl and python regex in several months
02:29	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: sudo sysctl net/ipv4/ip_forward=1 && sudo iptables -F && /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE (Just try that as one line you may have things that are stopping iptables from working)
02:29	<Tenshi>	it's always a relearning process every time I have to do it
02:30	<hyphenated>	yeah, unless you actively use them, you'll forget bits and pieces
02:30	<Evanescent>	153 updates... that's worse than windblows
02:31	<atomical>	i have a good script that includes the proper sysctl kernel options
02:31	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, and they get ugly really quickly :(
02:31	<DBO>	Evanescent, just install?
02:31	<Evanescent>	yeah
02:31	<atomical>	wait
02:31	<DBO>	Evanescent, yeah thats normal, but it dies off quick, of course the dapper upgrade comes soon...
02:31	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn ok will try
02:31	<twopeak>	can anyone help me with my harddrive problem?
02:31	<Evanescent>	my first experience of ubuntu
02:31	<DBO>	Evanescent, welcome aboard
02:31	<spikeb>	updates are not windows' problem
02:31	<atomical>	Evanescent, welcome to Ubuntu
02:32	<spikeb>	the fact that they don't fix the problems has more to do with it
02:32	<Evanescent>	DBO: i applied for the new version 6.06 on disc
02:32	<sr71>	 a lot more user friendly then red hat
02:32	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: especially if you use POSIX character classes instead of Perl-Compatible (PCRE) ones. eg: [[:space:] ]  instead of \s or somesuch
02:32	<Evanescent>	yeah that's why i installed it to see how i get on with it
02:32	<atomical>	Evanescent, 6.06 is a great product
02:33	<Evanescent>	i've used mandrake before
02:33	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn it displayed net.ipv4.ip_forward =1 and now its frozen :-O
02:33	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, I was doing some spam research during my masters.  We had gigs of logs to sort through.  It's amazing how many ways you can represent a hostname and email address ...
02:33	<twopeak>	does the jumper on a harddrive change something if a disk is readable or not?
02:34	<Evanescent>	and the more operating systems i can get familiar with the better as i'm training as a DST
02:34	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: yeah, I would have googled for an expression someone worked out already instead of trying to make up my own :-)
02:34	<Tenshi>	I just installed manpages, but no /usr/bin/man to be found anywhere
02:34	<Tenshi>	is it supposed to be somewhere else?
02:35	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: Was that from the console or ssh ?
02:35	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: and 'LANG=C awk' (or whatever equivalent you use) will be a bunch of times faster (about 5) since it doesn't have to convert character sets
02:35	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn from ssh
02:35	<sr71>	dst?
02:35	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn the console is still running but i think SSH has frozen as it doest respond anymore
02:35	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, actually, I was using python at the time :)
02:36	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: Flushing all the firewall rules will terminate the connections in process
02:36	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: it probably still would have helped
02:36	<hyphenated>	maybe not so much, since python uses unicode types a lot internally.
02:37	<Evanescent>	(sr71) dst?: desktop support technician
02:37	<sr71>	oh ok
02:37	<Tenshi>	yeah, but I was taking all of my results and building relational databases with it, so I needed a decent language to handle the data once I stripped it
02:37	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn ok so should i run that from the console instead?
02:37	<Evanescent>	but it's mainly based in windows :(
02:37	<Evanescent>	but i want to take the comptia linux+
02:38	<hyphenated>	Tenshi: ah, other things would have been slower than the parsing of the text then.
02:38	<Amit>	hello
02:38	<Tenshi>	hyphenated, actually, the mysql server was off-lan, so the IO between that was by far the bottleneck
02:38	<Amit>	anybody can help me?
02:38	<sr71>	hello amit
02:38	<miranda82>	hello
02:39	<Amit>	well i just installed ubuntu 5.10 on a new partition and when I look at the grub menu it does give my win xp as choice to boot
02:39	<Amit>	what can be done?
02:39	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: Yep - do them one at a time without the && if you want
02:39	<Amit>	it does not*
02:40	<sr71>	you probley partioned the whole drive
02:40	<Amit>	no
02:40	<Amit>	winxp was on another hdd
02:41	<plh>	now do i update all my icons and artwork? i installed as dapper f5, and i noticed the newest dapper that i install on another computer
02:41	<plh>	has new artwork and icons
=== Kadran__ is now known as Kadran
02:41	<sr71>	OK so xp was on slave drive?
02:41	<hyphenated>	plh: #ubuntu+1
02:41	<Amit>	yes sr71
02:41	<sr71>	OK
02:42	<Amit>	i had win98 on my master and i installed ubuntu on it
02:42	<plh>	hyphenated: oh. thanks
02:42	<twopeak>	Can someone tell me in grub: what's the use of having a ubuntu recover mode
02:42	<sr71>	Then I think I know the prob
02:42	<hyphenated>	twopeak: in case you screw things up
02:42	<Amit>	ok
02:42	<Amit>	hope you have the solution :D
02:42	<sr71>	to dual boot you need both os on one drive
02:42	<twopeak>	hyphenated, thanks.
02:43	<hyphenated>	twopeak: it boots you into single-user mode and lets you fix your mistake
02:43	<Amit>	ok
02:43	<Amit>	so what can be done?
02:43	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn ok ran it , didnt get much output but no errors
02:43	<killercacti>	and recover mode boots automatically into console, right
02:43	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: Now try pinging an ip from behind
02:44	<jack->	from below rocks too, or from above if you feel crazy
02:45	<sr71>	Amin do you have partion magic?
02:45	<Amit>	i have it on winxp
02:45	<Amit>	does it exist on ubuntu also?
02:45	<miranda82>	Amit, use gparted
02:46	<hyphenated>	he doesn't have a partition problem
02:46	<sr71>	it is a seprate program not sure but it should work on both
02:46	<hyphenated>	he has a grub configuration problem
02:46	<Amit>	yes
02:46	<miranda82>	hyphenated, i just arrived and read that: Amin do you have partion magic?
02:47	<Amit>	well sr71  do you i need to download partition magic for ubuntu?
02:47	<miranda82>	Amit, what happens? Sorry i just arrived
02:47	<sr71>	if his hard drive is slave and the os is on it he does
02:47	<Amit>	well i just installed ubuntu 5.10 on my master hdd
02:47	<Amit>	but i have win xp on my slave hdd
02:47	<Amit>	which isnt in the grub menu when i boot
02:47	<miranda82>	oh
02:48	<sr71>	you need both os's on one hd
02:48	<Amit>	i want to be able to boot winxp also
02:48	<miranda82>	that's easy to do
02:48	<hyphenated>	Amit: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=173028
02:48	<khaled>	Amit, you just need to conifgure grub
02:48	<Amit>	well help me
02:48	<hyphenated>	Amit: comment #5
02:48	<sr71>	they run different formats
02:48	<miranda82>	Amit, what does sudo fdisk -l
02:48	<miranda82>	return?
02:48	<sr71>	xp ntfs and linux grub

02:50	<hyphenated>	Amit: this is not the pastebin ;-)
02:51	<hyphenated>	Amit: and the link I gave you is for precisely your problem
02:51	<jel>	how big should i make /boot ? i need to make a seperate boot partition...
02:51	<sorush20>	guys how do I merge iso images into one.. the iso images are videos mpeg but I want to merge the into one.. is that possible?
02:51	<Evanescent>	can anyone tell me how to login as root?
02:51	<miranda82>	as we can see
02:51	<hyphenated>	ubotu: tell Evanescent about sudo
02:51	<miranda82>	he sees hdb
02:51	<Subhuman>	Evanescent, root is disabled, if you need root use sudo
02:51	<miranda82>	the second hardrive,
02:51	<MSch_>	jel: each kernel image is approx. 10 mb big...
02:51	<Evanescent>	sudo?
02:51	<hyphenated>	Evanescent: read the link ubotu gave you
02:51	<miranda82>	Amit, still there?
02:52	<Amit>	yes
02:52	<jel>	MSch - so 50mb would be enough for /boot ?
02:52	<Amit>	i am here
02:52	<Evanescent>	ok thanks
02:52	<Amit>	miranda82, what do i need to do?
02:52	<miranda82>	Amit, can u just se pastebin.com to put the output?
02:52	<MSch_>	jel: well, i use 200 MB because i ran into problems with 70 MB, but i used the unstable dapper with a new kernel every second week
02:52	<TobiasFar>	what's the root password for mysql or where do i find it?
02:52	<miranda82>	Amit, it would be easier for me to guide u
02:52	<hyphenated>	Amit: I already gave you a link telling you what to do
02:52	<Amit>	ok wait
02:52	<hyphenated>	Amit: was it not good enough?
02:53	<jel>	ok i'll give it 150mb
02:53	<h3sp4wn>	jel: 100 will be more than enough - the most important thing is that its the first partition on the disk
02:53	<jel>	oh
02:53	<jel>	thats a problem then
02:54	<jel>	it will be the 3rd
02:54	<h3sp4wn>	There is not much point in doing that if its not the first partition on the disk
02:54	<jel>	im not installing from the live cd...
02:54	<void^>	boot doesn't have to be 1st partition
02:54	<hyphenated>	jel: third partition or third disk?
02:54	<jel>	third partition
02:54	<blue-frog>	TobiasFar, ther is no root password for mysql when you hace just installed it
02:54	<hyphenated>	the rule about it being near the beginning of the disk isn't so important on new hardware
02:55	<void^>	it matters only on older mainboards that have problems booting high cyl partitions
02:55	<miranda82>	Amit, ?
02:55	<jel>	i was told XFS and grub cannot be on the same partition
02:55	<Amit>	yes
02:55	<TobiasFar>	blue-frog, okay
02:55	<Amit>	am on pastebin.com
02:55	<jel>	and grub is a real pain in the ass to get working presently, so i figured i would just make a new /boot partition, so the kubuntu installed (dapper) can handle it
02:55	<jel>	:D
02:55	<miranda82>	Amit, paste it... if u want help..
02:55	<Amit>	it's like taking forever when i clicked on the send button
02:55	<TobiasFar>	thx
02:55	<hyphenated>	jel: well, grub understands ext3. if it understands xfs then you'll be ok. I don't know if it does or not
02:55	<miranda82>	Amit, ok i wait

02:56	<jel>	does grub understand reiser ?
02:56	<gnomefreak>	^^^ doesnt have the issues that pastebin.com has been having
02:56	<miranda82>	Amit, just reload the page, and resendit, or whatever..
02:56	<void^>	jel: yes. but a separate boot partition doesn't hurt anyway
02:57	<miranda82>	or use the webboard
02:57	<Amit>	is the website slow or what?
02:57	<Amit>	it's just saying waiting for pastebin.com...
02:57	<blue-frog>	TobiasFar, to set a password... mysqladmin -u root password "new_password"
02:58	<miranda82>	Amit, try then http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/

02:59	<Amit>	already sent

02:59	<jel>	JFS?
02:59	<jel>	reiser ?
02:59	<khaled>	ext3
02:59	<jel>	it shouldnt make any diff right?

03:11	<ubuntu>	I tried to use partition magic but when I try to apply the changes in the disk in order to have a new partition
03:11	<tarun>	Perkin you need to install java methinks

03:11	<miranda82>	Amit, error?
03:12	<ubuntu>	with Error 732
03:12	<christo_>	gnomefreak - does that mean that there are no xinerama packages to install? Looks like it's just an xorg.conf mod
03:12	<Amit>	no error but it was stuck as if
03:12	<christo_>	modification
03:12	<gnomefreak>	christo_: read the link ompaul gave you
03:12	<Perkin>	and where can i find it?
03:12	<gnomefreak>	im looking at page atm
03:12	<munzir>	Hi, what's the command to view all the services that will start at boot and on which runlevels would they start?
03:13	<ompaul>	!Xinerama
03:13	<ubotu>	Check these URLs out and hopefully it works for you: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaHowTo or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaMultipleMonitors
03:13	<ubuntu>	so anytime I want to generate any change on my HDD I can not do it.. even with the partition utility of ubuntu anyone can help me?
03:13	<miranda82>	ubuntu, u won't be able to change mounted partitions
03:13	<Zardiac>	Im studying japanese and looking for a software which can help me study words..
03:14	<miranda82>	ubuntu, try the official Gparted live cd
03:14	<MSch_>	munzir: ls /etc/rc2.d for runlevel 2, and so on
03:14	<Amit>	miranda82, is there anything else u can suggest me?
03:14	<gnomefreak>	ompaul: can you add this link to it also http://linuxreviews.org/howtos/xfree/Xinerama-HOWTO/
03:14	<miranda82>	Amit, u said
03:14	<miranda82>	stucked on screen as if..
03:14	<miranda82>	need more detaisl
03:14	<gnomefreak>	^^^ step by step guide by the looks of it
03:14	<ompaul>	Zardiac, stick your head into #ubuntu-offtopic it might be useful for that question
03:14	<tarun>	Perkin, get Sun's J2SDK
03:15	<Amit>	well when i choose windows on the menu
03:15	<munzir>	MSch_: isn't there is a direct way like chkconfig in rpm-based distros?
03:15	<Amit>	it get stucks to the screen where the lines are as follows: .. Booting 'Windows"..
03:15	<ompaul>	!Xinerama
03:15	<stjepan>	anyone here uses gnome-dictionary?
03:15	<ubotu>	Check these URLs out and hopefully it works for you: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaHowTo or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XineramaMultipleMonitors maybe  http://linuxreviews.org/howtos/xfree/Xinerama-HOWTO/
03:15	<gnomefreak>	munzir: dont know maybe ask in a rpm distros channel?
03:15	<gnomefreak>	ompaul: thank you sir
03:16	<miranda82>	Amit, does that windows installation work? xD
03:16	<Perkin>	ok, i'll see what i do
03:16	<MSch_>	munzir: there's the services menu in gnome but i don't know what chkconfig does
03:16	<Perkin>	thanks anyway
03:16	<ubuntu>	no... I have tried to change a nfts partition from Windows with partition magic but it generates Error 732 and I can not change it...
03:16	<Amit>	yeah it worked fine before i installed ubuntu
03:16	<Amit>	i mean now i cant boot it
03:16	<seanh>	Hi I just started using LyX on Breezy and I notice that the font seems to have a bug with the character 'f' not displaying properly, is there a solution known for this?
03:16	<miranda82>	Amit, don t really know, though my solution was working
03:17	<gnomefreak>	brb
03:17	<munzir>	gnomefreak: sorry! should I ask in fedora channel a question what's the equivalent command of chkconfig in ubutnu?!
03:17	<miranda82>	it should work btw
03:17	<Evanescent>	heh brb i found xchat
03:17	<Amit>	miranda82, what's the command to look into menu.lst?
03:17	<seanh>	Specifically, it seems to be f's that have been cut-pasted into LyX form elsewhere, and uppercase f's. If I type a lowercase f into LyX directly it looks fine
03:17	<Amit>	the one you gave me before
03:18	<miranda82>	sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
03:18	<Amit>	ok thanks
03:18	<gnomefreak>	munzir: you asked isnt there a direct way to like chkconfig in rpm-based distros
03:18	<gnomefreak>	sorry but i dont see ubuntu nor debian mentioned in that
03:18	<gnomefreak>	brb
03:19	<munzir>	MSch_: the services menu in gnome didn't give me the runlevels. besides I want to do it from a command line. In gentoo I guess they have rc-status -all
03:19	<ubuntu>	anyone know why can not apply any changes with partition magic and Error 732 is generated?
03:20	<munzir>	gnomefreak: sorry if my question is  not clear. is it clear now or still need clarification?
03:20	<munzir>	gnomefreak: in fedora I use chkconfig in ubuntu I don't know what to use
03:21	<Perkin>	how do i close a channel in irssi?
03:21	<elkbuntu>	you type /part
03:22	<MSch_>	munzir: what's wrong with ls /etc/rc?.d
03:22	<gnomefreak>	munzir: i relized what you were asking as i was typing it hence the sorry part of it
03:24	<SeLaB>	i need help
03:24	<SeLaB>	today is my first day on ubuntu
03:24	<SeLaB>	please tell me
03:24	<SeLaB>	where to get started
03:24	<MSch_>	SeLaB: depends on what you want to do...
03:24	<SeLaB>	and also the commdands used for ubuntu
03:24	<lastnode>	what is the bash command to format a disk?
03:25	<MSch_>	lastnode: mkfs
03:25	<SeLaB>	MSch_, i would like to do everything which I use to on winxp
=== evil_ is now known as `Evil
03:26	<lastnode>	MSch_: im booting off a livecd, and i want to completely format /dev/hda. what is tne syntax?
03:26	<MSch_>	lastnode: i'd suggest using gparted, that's a graphical frontend
03:26	<munzir>	MSch_: I need to do this ls for each runlevel then I need to check my service in each output. e.g. to tell apache would start at runlevel 2 and 5 but not 3 and 1 there it's not convenient
03:27	<lastnode>	MSch_: but will it completely erase everything? including mbr? there are some bad blocks, so i want to wipe everything possible
03:27	<MSch_>	lastnode: then use dd
03:27	<lastnode>	MSch_: for a forty gig disk, how many sets of 1024 bytes would i need to send?
03:28	<lastnode>	(ive already used 1024 x 1000)
03:28	<jikanter>	IDENTIFY july1985
03:28	<lnx^>	ew?
03:28	<jikanter>	oops
03:28	<void^>	jikanter: time for a new password
03:28	<MSch_>	lastnode: 42949672960 says bc
03:29	<Evanescent>	yay success
03:29	<SeLaB>	what is the paste bin site of ubuntu
03:29	<lastnode>	MSch_: ok thanks, that'll take a while, right?
03:29	<lastnode>	!paste
03:29	<ubotu>	see <!pastebin>	please
03:29	<lastnode>	!pastebin
03:29	<ubotu>	Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
03:29	<MSch_>	lastnode: no, that would be bytes, sorry. 40 gigabytes = 41 943 040 kilobytes
03:30	<lastnode>	MSch_: count=42949672960 is correct, yes?
03:30	<MSch_>	MSch_: why don't you just omit count? afaik it should write till the end of the disk then?
03:30	<munzir>	MSch_: now I checked rc2.d I found K77ntp-server in red where the other links in cyan, does this means it's broken?
03:30	<lastnode>	MSch_: lol you talking to yourself? :p ok dude, doing that. thanks a lot :)
03:32	<MSch_>	munzir: it means that the link is linking to nowhere, so yes it's broken
03:32	<gfxstyler>	hi
03:32	<enriquedf>	anyone can help me? with a partition ? it does not work...
03:32	<lastnode>	hi gfxstyler
03:32	<lastnode>	enriquedf: "doesnt work" is not helpful. what is the error message?
03:33	<gfxstyler>	does someone here uses a fat32 partition to share data between win and linux?
03:33	<munzir>	MSch_: how can I tell which package generated it so I report it to launchpad?
03:33	<enriquedf>	well i tried to use partition magic and the utility partition of ubuntu but they dont want to apply the changes...
03:33	<lastnode>	gfxstyler: i used to. before i killed winblows
03:33	<enriquedf>	.... in partition magic it generates error 732...
03:34	<gfxstyler>	lastnode: could you execute applications from the fat32 partition in linux?
03:34	<Evanescent>	try fdisk
03:34	<gfxstyler>	because i get a "permission denied" when trying to do that (i have read-write support though)
03:34	<MSch_>	munzir: install apt-file it will tell you. but not every broken link means that the package has a problem, it may just be left over after you removed the package
03:35	<munzir>	MSch_: even so the post script should remove it, no?
03:35	<enriquedf>	mmm but it is strange that neither the utility partition of ubuntu resizes the old partition in order to get free space...
03:36	<rohan>	wow, automatix was taken out of arnieboy's hands ?
03:36	<rohan>	good :)
03:37	<enriquedf>	anyone has used partition magic?
03:37	<gfxstyler>	me
03:37	<rohan>	me too
03:37	<`Evil>	can someone help me please? i have a problem with apache2 and php files
03:37	<gnomefreak>	rohan: where did you see that?
03:37	<MSch_>	munzir: hm, i gues that's why there's a difference between purging packages and removing them. removing leaves the configuration intact, while purging deletes it
03:37	<Evanescent>	enriquedf: yes a long time ago... it's a pain
03:37	<enriquedf>	gfxstyler, rohan: do u know why do I get an error 732, and pm does not apply any changes on the partitions?
03:38	<gfxstyler>	i dunno
03:38	<batman>	hey anyone have any idea how i could possibly sym link the /home to a different hard drive to where it uses the other hard drives disc space?
03:38	<enriquedf>	evanescent: why is it a pain? hehe
03:38	<MSch_>	batman: just mount the drive as /home
03:39	<rohan>	gnomefreak: on a post
03:39	<rohan>	wait
03:39	<Evanescent>	because it would never let me do what i wanted, so i went back to basics and use fdisk
03:39	<batman>	MSch_ would i need to copy over the /home contents first?
03:39	<rohan>	gnomefreak: http://www.krazypenguin.net/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_6.06_Guide#Easily_install_additional_software
03:39	<Evanescent>	less hassle
03:39	<MSch_>	batman: yes
03:39	<rohan>	gnomefreak: from that site -- "Arnieboy will not be involved in the project at that time, but somebody else will."
03:39	<gnomefreak>	rohan: ty
03:39	<rohan>	gnomefreak: btw, plz change your nick to gnome_is_frek
03:39	<rohan>	lol
03:39	<enriquedf>	evanescent: do u know how to use fdisk in order to resize the disk and create a new partition?
03:39	<rohan>	*freak
03:39	<rohan>	:D
03:40	<gnomefreak>	lol
03:40	<Evanescent>	not possible to resize unfortunately
03:40	<rohan>	enriquedf: use gparted from the ubuntu live cd
03:40	<rohan>	enriquedf: fdisk will cause loss of data
03:40	<Evanescent>	that's what i was about to say
03:41	<enriquedf>	rohan: i tried to use gparted from the live cd but when i try to resized it, it doesnt want to apply the changes!.. so strange..
03:41	<rohan>	strange indeed ..
03:42	<doped1>	is it possible to change my character set to danish encoding from a gui? or should i search for dpkg's?
03:42	<neogenesis>	vh
03:43	<Evanescent>	enriquedf: what message do you get?
03:44	<enriquedf>	evanescent: it says applying changes.... and then it returns back to the same size!... i do not get error message with gparted
03:45	<munzir>	MSch_: ok in this case the link points to a file that sould be generated by ntp-server; dpkg -l ntp-server shows the package as 'un' which I guess means it's not installed. If it has been removed but have a config file remaining I think I would gave another status "C?" so I guess yes it's a bug
03:45	<miranda82>	enriquedf, use the official live cd of gparted
03:45	<Corey>	woohooo sucessfully instaled unbuntu :D !
03:45	<doped1>	:P
03:45	<enriquedf>	miranda82: where i can get it?
03:45	<miranda82>	from the website
03:45	<Corey>	alright now to install all the stuff again haha
03:46	<miranda82>	enriquedf, http://gparted.sourceforge.net/
03:47	<doped1>	how to change ubuntu charecter set?
03:47	<haffe>	doped1: In what meaning?
03:48	<doped1>	haffe: i'm from denmark, and i'd like the whole charecter set to be western instead of UTF8
03:48	<haffe>	Where?
03:49	<haffe>	I don't understand.
03:49	<doped1>	i'd hope i could change it in whole ubuntu
03:49	<haffe>	UTF-8 has support for all international characters.
03:49	<doped1>	i cant see danish chracters in file names and folderes..
03:49	<Capozide>	Can anybody help me with making a symbolic link?
03:50	<bung>	ln -s source dest
03:50	<MSch_>	Capozide: ln -s target link
03:50	<kane77>	hi everybody...
03:50	<haffe>	doped1: Is it a mounted windows partition?
03:51	<doped1>	yes, :) how did u know..
03:51	<haffe>	Intuition.
03:51	<haffe>	:)
03:51	<babo>	where's a good place to store a subversion repository ... ?
03:51	<doped1>	and theres another problem on the drive too.. it wont show all the files.. some word files
03:51	<kane77>	how to have my windows partitions and disks mounted in such a way that I wouldn't need sudo to write to them.... (FAT of course)..
03:51	<doped1>	other word files is shows great
03:51	<haffe>	The problem is that windows uses ISO8859-1 as encoding, while ubuntu uses UTF-8.
03:52	<haffe>	The simplest method is to tell mount to use ISO8859-1 for the windows drives.
03:52	<doped1>	ok :P that why it says invalid encoding :)
03:52	<doped1>	yes, THAT's my problem then :)
03:52	<silasj>	hi
03:52	<haffe>	Yes, apparently.
03:52	<doped1>	haffe: can you help with that :P
03:53	<haffe>	Sure.
03:53	<doped1>	well, thanks
03:53	<haffe>	How much experience do you have with ubuntu?
03:53	<haffe>	Or linux at all.
03:53	<doped1>	it was automounted when i installed ubutnu..
03:53	<Seantater>	!flight7
03:53	<ubotu>	hmm... flight7 is available via http://www.ubuntu.com/testing, or http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/flight-7/
03:53	<doped1>	not much, installe a little with apt-get and dpkg
03:54	<haffe>	doped1: Are you using Ubuntu or kubuntu?
03:54	<doped1>	ubuntu
03:54	<haffe>	Ok.
03:54	<haffe>	Just a minute, I will switch to my gnomemachine.
03:54	<doped1>	:) thanks!
03:55	<enriquedf>	miranda82: i have downloaded it ... now, if i want to execute it?
03:56	<_mason>	Quick Question, does ubuntu come with its own firewall & if so, how do i open a port?
03:56	<kane77>	how to have my windows partitions and disks mounted in such a way that I wouldn't need sudo to write to them.... (FAT of course)..
03:56	<edulix>	hi !
03:56	<davidhouse>	which packages do i need to play m4as in kaffeine?
03:56	<Capozide>	Can anybody help me privately, I'm having a little bit of a complexed problem
03:57	<edulix>	I want to connect to a windows pc and execute an app there
03:57	<doped1>	haffe: are you there.. im gonna quit for 5 minutes, and come back!, backing up the files on the drive, and formating it to FAT for better visa versa read-write result from both windows and ubuntu
03:57	<Tsingi>	any ubuntu nis experts?
03:57	<Subhuman>	kane77, open a terminal , type "sudo nano /etc/fstab" look for the lines with "vfat" in them, and then where it says "defaults" make it "defaults,rw"
03:58	<haffe_>	Ok, I'm back.
03:58	<doped1>	yes..
03:58	<doped1>	ok.. well 2 sek
03:58	<haffe_>	Start a terminal.
03:58	<doped1>	haffe: im gonna quit for 5 minutes, and come back!, backing up the files on the drive, and formating it to FAT for better visa versa read-write result from both windows and ubuntu
03:58	<edulix>	the thing is I need to use some windows app that I  haven't been able to use with wine. what I want to do is to execute it remotely in my mom's pc, without bothering her of course
03:59	<kane77>	Subhuman and is there any way to write to NTFS??
03:59	<edulix>	so vnc probably wouldn't make it, what else could I use?
03:59	<doped1>	haffe_: i'll be back in 5 min
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
04:00	<ompaul>	doped1, we know, go and come back

04:00	<doped1>	ok

04:00	<ubotu>	well, captive is a project to use windows NTFS drivers under linux. It does not work properly with Ubuntu.

04:00	<Subhuman>	oh Kane77, looks like captive doesnt work with ubuntu.

04:08	<ubotu>	I heard mp3 is a non-free format. To enable mp3 capability, read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
04:08	<Madmerc>	hello room :D
04:09	<Tsingi>	http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/dapper/net/nis states that NIS requires debconf >= 0.5.00 however debconf is currently at 1.4.72.
04:09	<Tsingi>	It's been my experience that when I start installing stuff that isn't in the package manager, I break ubuntu, so should I drop ubuntu and install debian to get NIS?  Or is it safe?
04:09	<doped1>	haffe_,  i'm back
04:09	<Madmerc>	is there anyone here who knows about this ubuntu linux ???
04:09	<ompaul>	Tsingi, dapper is in the channel #ubuntu+1
04:09	<davidhouse>	which packages do i need to play m4as in kaffeine?
04:09	<Tsingi>	ompaul: thanks
04:09	<Corey>	how do i make myself an admin
04:10	<ompaul>	Madmerc, help.ubuntu.com and docs.ubuntu.com are a good place to start, unless you have a specific question
04:10	<Capozide>	Can anybody help me with symbolic links?
04:10	<ompaul>	Corey, read that root page again
04:10	<gnomefreak>	!symlinks
04:10	<ubotu>	I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, gnomefreak
04:10	<Madmerc>	should i upgrade my copy of ubuntu from warty warthog ???
04:10	<Capozide>	Not just the syntax, I need help from a person
04:10	<gnomefreak>	Madmerc: yes to hoary than to breezy
04:10	<MSch_>	Capozide: ln -s Target Link
04:11	<theverant>	how can I check if Ubuntu is using both my CPUs?
04:11	<Capozide>	Arrgh, I know the syntax
04:11	<theverant>	is there a command that displays CPU info?
04:11	<Madmerc>	could i just download the breezy iso and install it fresh ???
04:11	<gnomefreak>	theverant: maybe top?
04:11	<Capozide>	I need help with GCC
04:11	<MSch_>	Capozide: what's your exact problem? (sorry for restating the arguments)
04:11	<gnomefreak>	Madmerc: yes
04:11	<haffe__>	theverant: cat /proc/cpuinfo
04:11	<Madmerc>	ok thanx guys
04:11	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn Thanks for all the help Re: routing
04:11	<doped1>	haffe
04:11	<doped1>	:P
04:12	<haffe__>	doped1: Yes ?
04:12	<ompaul>	Madmerc, the "approved route" to do that is to take two hops one via hoary and the next via breezy to get to dapper next month, warty has no support since 1 month ago, I suggest you actually download the install for 5.10 or Dapper (the almost finished beta) and start from there
04:12	<doped1>	yes.. the mount problem
04:12	<haffe__>	Yes.
04:12	<haffe__>	Start a terminal.
04:12	<doped1>	haffe__,  done
04:12	<Corey>	I keep getting this error when i install stuff unable to lock the administration directory
04:12	<haffe__>	type sudo nano /etc/fstab
04:12	<Evanescent>	heh i'm exploring and just found khangman "for children 6 and above"... that's about my level... lol
04:12	<ompaul>	Corey, sudo apt-get isntall WHATEVER
04:12	<ubuntu>	hey
04:12	<theverant>	haffe__ it shows CPU 0 only... shouldn't it list two seperately?  It sees CPU 0 as an X2 though...
04:12	<Madmerc>	oh one more thing ... my synaptic package manager doesnt seem to find any updates for the packages is that because there are none or is it just not working ???
04:13	<doped1>	haffe__,  done
04:13	<gnomefreak>	Corey: do you have another apt process running such as synaptic or apt-get update or an update manager?
04:13	<Corey>	yes actually
04:13	<haffe__>	doped1: Do you see the line relating to your windows partion?
04:13	<ubuntu>	i looking for this option  in the installer option for filesystem as "do not use the partition". for do i find it
04:13	<Corey>	thanks that helped
04:13	<Capozide>	Well I want to change the symbolic link in my /usr/bin/ from GCC 4.0 to GCC 3.4
04:13	<doped1>	haffe__,  after i converted the ntfs, to fat, when i booted ubuntu, i could't mount the drive becouse it wasnt htfs anymore
04:13	<gnomefreak>	Madmerc: i think it has to do with support being stopped on warty
04:14	<doped1>	haffe__, yes i see the partitions were fixing :P
04:14	<Madmerc>	oh ok well thats good news thanx i wasnt sure if my internet was working properly :P
04:14	<gnomefreak>	Capozide: theres an export command to make that simple
04:14	<haffe__>	First thing, change ntfs to vfat
04:14	<Capozide>	Because I get errors compiling a certain program in GCC 4.0, but it's supposed to work in GCC 3.4
04:14	<doped1>	haffe__ ok
04:14	<MSch_>	Capozide: what about update-alternatives?
04:14	<gnomefreak>	Capozide: first install gcc-3.4
04:15	<gnomefreak>	MSch_: its not there
04:15	<Capozide>	I've already installed GCC 3.4
04:15	<doped1>	haffe__, done
04:15	<Corey>	im glad I have fast inerenet :D
04:15	<autosuggested>	Anyone here familiar with NFS and using it with iptables?
04:15	<gnomefreak>	ompaul: what teh export command for gcc?
04:15	<Corey>	I had to delete my windows partion ! :( !
04:15	<haffe__>	doped1: After you've done that you should see a line saying something like user,ro
04:15	<gnomefreak>	isnt it exportCC=3.4?
04:15	<Madmerc>	ok guys well thanx for ur help ttyl
04:15	<haffe__>	append NLS=iso8859-1 to that line.
04:15	<disinterseted_pe>	im getting an error on mplayer: it says new_face failed. maybe the font path is wrong. please supply the font file (~/. mplayer/subfont.ttf). where do i find this
04:15	<Evanescent>	i guess linux user have a lot of time on their hands judging by the number of games installed...
04:16	<theverant>	cat /proc/cpuinfo also only shows my 3800+ as 1Ghz... it should be 2Ghz
04:16	<stefkeh>	hello
04:16	<PJFitzgibbons>	noob quesiton: I want to add to the $PATH, but changing /etc/profile or ~/.bash_profile is not having an effect, even on new terminal windows?  Advice?
04:16	<Capozide>	When I type sudo update-alternatives --config gcc it says there are no alternatives for GCC
04:16	<johannes_erik>	just seen it mentioned a couple of seconds ago. I am about to download a new copy of ubuntu , i need a copy now, should i get the latest beta or the 5.10?
04:16	<anndy>	hey guys
04:16	<doped1>	haffe__, nope.. under options it says default
04:16	<stefkeh>	i have a question
04:16	<ubuntu>	c i looking for this option  in the installer option for filesystem as "do not use the partition". where to find the option after typeing server at prompt
04:16	<haffe__>	doped1: Ok, append the following ,user,NLS=ISO8859-1
04:17	<gnomefreak>	johannes_erik: have you been using ubuntu for a while?
04:17	<stefkeh>	i downloaded the .iso and i burned it to a dvd but it doesnt boot up when i select boot from cd
04:17	<`Evil>	can anyone help me with pache2 please? i got a problem with PHP
04:17	<theverant>	anyone know how I can adjust how ubuntu is using the CPU?
04:17	<anndy>	i am using ubuntu 5.10
04:17	<MSch_>	Capozide: it's cc and not gcc isn't it?
04:17	<johannes_erik>	gnomefreek yes good few years although a slackware fan at heart :p
04:17	<gnomefreak>	stefkeh: dvd iso or cd iso
04:17	<stefkeh>	cd iso
04:17	<Capozide>	Yes
04:17	<Capozide>	No, it's GCC
04:17	<PJFitzgibbons>	johannes: depends on what your'e going to do. I've just tried Dapper a few different ways and need to stick with Hoary for now.. .dev tools are not totally synced in dapper yet.
04:17	<Capozide>	Do I need to install CC?
04:17	<gnomefreak>	johannes_erik: you should be ok with dapper
04:17	<anndy>	and i wanna connect motorola L7 to my PC so that i can use internet on my PC
04:17	<Capozide>	Hold on -_-
04:18	<gnomefreak>	Capozide: no
04:18	<h3sp4wn>	johsnnes_erik: Is the routing working ok now ?
04:18	<doped1>	haffe__,  done, should i tab the rest so it matches the "line"
04:18	<haffe__>	theverant: What is it you want to do?
04:18	<Capozide>	It says
04:18	<haffe__>	doped1: No.
04:18	<johannes_erik>	ok , i was just checking , i havent kept up to date with the builds and was sure if it was stable enough for general use yet
04:18	<Capozide>	There is only 1 program which provides cc.
04:18	<anndy>	cell is GPRS enabled and i got service also active from my service provider
04:18	<johannes_erik>	thanks gnomefreek :)
04:18	<haffe__>	Just your windows partitions.
04:18	<autosuggested>	Using nfs with a firewall, anybody?
04:18	<theverant>	haffe__ I want it to see both cores... it's also showing the one core at 1GHz, and it should be 2
04:18	<MSch_>	Capozide: even though you've installed both GCC versions?
04:18	<Capozide>	Yet I've installed GCC 3.4
04:18	<Capozide>	Yes
04:19	<doped1>	haffe__,  ok, i want the other windows partition to be iso8859-1 too, should i use same option
04:19	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn yes sorted problem , seems i currupted the iptable at some point :S. it wouldnt write changes to it , i reinstalled ubuntu and all good now
04:19	<MSch_>	Capozide: why don't you just change the symlink for gcc?
04:19	<Capozide>	That's what I need help with in the first place
04:19	<Capozide>	I don't know how to do that
04:19	<johannes_erik>	h3sp4wn thanks for the help though the way u suggested was far easier! :)
04:20	<ubuntu>	can someone help me i am  looking for this option  in the installer option for filesystem as "do not use the partition". where to find the option after typeing server at prompt
04:20	<haffe__>	doped1: Yes.
04:20	<MSch_>	Capozide: sudo rm /usr/bin/gcc?
04:20	<EvanCarroll>	anyone know an easy way to get the tty of a modem?
04:20	<doped1>	haffe__,  ok, it was: user,NLS=ISO8859-1

04:21	<lunaticgal>	thanks lastnode
04:21	<MSch_>	Capozide: that's just a symbolic link
04:21	<lastnode>	np lunaticgal
04:22	<MSch_>	Capozide: ll /usr/bin/gcc and you'll see
04:22	<lastnode>	lunaticgal: what's the model?

04:23	<MSch_>	Capozide: whereis gcc
04:23	<babo>	MSch_: I've created a repository and added a directory, it seemed to work fine. But when I go to checkout a file, it seems that my repository has no trunks directory ... only ... conf  dav  db  format  hooks  locks  README.txt
04:23	<doped1>	haffe__,  now i should save.. but how? writeOut?
04:23	<babo>	where did my files go ... how can I access them .. ?

04:25	<MSch_>	babo: the directory you are talking about contains the versioning information. use svn checkout to get to the data stored in there
04:25	<disinterseted_pe>	hello
04:25	<lunaticgal>	lastnode: m totally new.. dunno anything.
04:25	<doped1>	haffe__,  now i should reboot?
04:25	<babo>	MSch_: well, no I just imported a directory and now I want to check out a file ...
04:25	<lastnode>	lunaticgal: cool, if it doesn't work there are other options, but first try camstream.
04:25	<haffe__>	doped1: Yes
04:25	<Capozide>	How is this actually setting up a symbolic link to GCC 3.4?
04:25	<doped1>	ok..

04:27	<babo>	MSch_: the manual tells me to checkout files from the trunks directory ... but apparently there is no trunks directory ...
04:27	<Capozide>	MSch_: How is this actually setting up a symbolic link to GCC 3.4 instead of GCC 4.0?
04:27	<lastnode>	mnk: that's not really helpful. what do you mean "doesnt get recognized"? give us the output of dmesg
04:27	<mnk>	ok

04:29	<ph_softnet>	i've successfully installed and configured an ubuntu workstation (upgraded to dapper drake) for our network.Now i want to clone this exact installation to the other machines.What is the recommended way to do it?
04:29	<MSch_>	Capozide: with some scripts that run after installation i guess
04:29	<lastnode>	metalhedd: we dont support dapper in here, sorry #ubuntu+1 is for that
04:29	<Madmerc>	how do i install a .deb package ??
04:29	<lastnode>	lunaticgal: need to find out what? id recommend looking at the original docs
04:29	<jazzanova>	is there stuffit expander for ubuntu ?
04:29	<lastnode>	Madmerc: dpkg -i file.deb
04:29	<Capozide>	MSch_: How am I supposed to know where these scripts are?

04:30	<lunaticgal>	_mason: i use b4 :P
04:30	<MSch_>	Capozide: you don't need to, you just have to replace it with a link to GCC-3.4
04:30	<babo>	MSch_: hmm ... but this is what the manual says to do ....
04:30	<babo>	$ svn import /tmp/myproject file:///path/to/repos/myproject -m "initial import"
04:30	<lastnode>	lunaticgal: lunaticgal help.ubuntu.com, wiki.ubuntu.com
04:30	<lastnode>	_mason: i already told you, #ubuntu+1
04:30	<MSch_>	babo: exactly. and what does the manual say about checking out?
04:30	<doped1>	haffe__, when i rebooted, it failed to mount local files systems, assumed it would be my 2 windows partitions, and now i cant acces them.
04:30	<Capozide>	MSch_: That's what I need help on, jesus christ, I don't know how to replace the link from GCC 4.0 to GCC 3.4
04:30	<_mason>	I cant get mine to connect and i have all the ports setup, i cant figure out whats wrong, does ubuntu have its own firewall  that i need to open some ports in?
04:30	<lunaticgal>	lastnode: thx

04:31	<babo>	MSch_: svn checkout file:///path/to/repos/myproject/trunk myproject ...

05:01	<Yannig>	carlos>	Would you prefer a whole copy-paste in pv?
05:01	<_mason>	dont toy with my emotions like that..
05:02	<Yannig>	It may be because it's a brand new language for Ubuntu?
05:02	<carlos>	Yannig: no, that's enough. Thanks
05:02	<CrippsFX>	'ello.
05:02	<CrippsFX>	How is ubuntu support for AMD 64 ?
05:02	<Ng>	CrippsFX: it's an officially supported platform
05:03	<Iam8up|lpy>	i'm trying to mount an ntfs partition so that gnome can read it, my problem is that if i mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /mountpoint it mounts it as root
05:03	<gnomefreak>	CrippsFX: with offical packages fairly good with non free packages it is eh
05:03	<Corey>	arm..... can wine run dreamweaver 8 ?
05:03	<CrippsFX>	is anybody running the native broadcom driver in x86_64?
05:03	<Ng>	Iam8up|lpy: you probably want to specify something like -o uid=YOURUIDHERE (you can find out your uid with "id" in a terminal). see "man mount"'s ntfs section for more details
05:03	<Iam8up|lpy>	i thought there was a -U option that would allow me to switch UIDs, so i tried mount -t ntfs -U 1000 /dev/hda1 /mountpoint
05:03	<CrippsFX>	... or xgl in x86_74? ;)
05:03	<Dr_Willis>	!ntfs
05:03	<ubotu>	ntfs is the filesystem used in Windows NT and newer; to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe.
05:03	<Iam8up|lpy>	Ng - i'll try it that way..
05:04	<lerch>	I get this error when trying to calculate some dependencies: dpkg: error processing lilypond-data (--configure): subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 1
05:04	<lerch>	
05:04	<Corey>	how do you install deb files ?
05:04	<CrippsFX>	dpkg
05:05	<CrippsFX>	Corey:~ specifically: dpkg -i <package>.deb
05:05	<Jeff1983>	i purchased some tv shows on dvd. i'd like to rip the commentary tracks only (i.e. no video) is there a way to do this?
05:05	<gnomefreak>	Corey: sudo dpkg -i file.deb
05:05	<CrippsFX>	oh yeah, sudo ... I forgot that part about ubuntu ;)
05:05	<aLPHa_LeaK>	<Corey>	arm..... can wine run dreamweaver 8 ? << there are linux alternatives to it
05:05	<gnomefreak>	lerch: sudo apt-get -f install    (thats all you type dont add a package to it)
05:05	<Corey>	oh really are they as graphically pleasing and good working as dreamweaer ?
05:06	<gnomefreak>	Corey: nvu and bluefish are the best IMHO (closet to dreamweaver i have found)
05:06	<lerch>	gnomefreak: what does that do? I think I may have a broken package in that lilypond thing, but I've used Synaptic's fix broken packages function several times
05:06	<Tuzlo>	CrippsFX: sudo isnt ubuntu secific. specially if you dont su to root
05:07	<johannes_erik>	corey dont be so doubtful about opensource software , most of the time its better wroking and has more features!
05:07	<Corey>	yeah I know that im just saying is it good ?
05:07	<gnomefreak>	lerch: that will fix broken packages  (i dont trust synaptic version
05:07	<CrippsFX>	Tuzlo:~ yeah, but ootb it is default behaviour, which is what I was pointing out. :)
05:07	<Corey>	cause im very used to phtooshop and dreamweaver
05:07	<Subhuman>	Corey, nvu is very good.
05:07	<lerch>	gnomefreak: ok, thanks
05:08	<Subhuman>	Corey, for photoshop, i suggest you get "gimpSHOP" a gimp hack to make it look like PS
05:08	<Subhuman>	!gimpshop
05:08	<ubotu>	Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Subhuman
05:08	<johannes_erik>	corey : generaly try and avoid windows binarys , wine may work but it wont be 100% solution
05:08	<lsuactiafner>	i have a window that extends past the bottem of my desktop, so i cant apply the settings. i used alt to move the window as far up as possible but the top part of the screen is like a hard border, how do i fix this?
05:08	<topyli>	Corey: photoshop and dreamweaver are windows software. if you really want to use them, you should run an operating system they run on. otherwise you better find linux programs :)
05:09	<Corey>	lol ok
05:09	<firepol>	hi, ive just upgraded to dapper. openoffice was removed, im trying to install it but i get a dependency error. can someone help ?
05:09	<rubso>	corey: i use The GIMP in Linux and Windows, its really cool and easy-to-use if you are a photoshop pro ;)
05:09	<Ng>	firepol: dapper questions in #ubuntu+1 please
05:09	<Corey>	yeah im a ps pro ive heard about gimpshop
05:09	<carlos>	Yannig: it works here
05:09	<firepol>	thanks Ng
05:09	<lerch>	gnomefreak: I get the excact same error message when running that command. It complaint's about the package either being not fully installed or removed.
05:09	<Corey>	which im going to install shortly
05:10	<gnomefreak>	lerch: no package name just sudo apt-get -f install
05:10	<rubso>	Corey: you could get rid of gimpshop, The GIMP regular interface is good :)
05:10	<carlos>	Yannig: I did some checks and it should work for you too. The only explanation I could give you is that you forgot to install the language packs for French
05:10	<lerch>	gnomefreak: yes, that's what I did
05:10	<CrippsFX>	Is ubuntu 6 out yet?

05:15	rubso>	gno	<efreak: i believe it upgrades packages only?
05:15	Ng>	johann	<s_erik: you don't need to reboot to change DNS details. I think we've already established that it's almost certainly DHCP that's to blame

05:20	rubso>	kil	<eracti: why don't you log into kde website, and get KDE Ubuntu Packages, or try the wiki.
05:20	edulix>	Co	<ey: depends what do you compare :P

07:23	johannes_e	<ik>	type exactly from here      cd /usr
07:23	gnomefreak	< disinterseted_pe: cd /usr/lib/blah/blah that lets you change directories to the path you give

07:24	disinterse	<ed_pe>	ok
07:24	johannes_e	<ik>	disinterested_pe lol its quite hard to explain but its like gnomefreak said
07:24	johannes_e	<ik>	i think it was the same with DOS :S cant mind
07:25	disinterse	<ed_pe>	it came up but i cant see what it says im at the bottom of the page
07:25	gnomefreak	< johannes_erik: yes cd does the same in dos
07:25	Aeudian>	I	< i install say bind9, postfix, ispconfig, apache, and i reboot the server, will these services automaticly restart do do i need to manually restart them>?
07:25	johannes_e	<ik>	disinterseted_pe anyway lol try   cd /usr
07:25	Flannel>	A	<udian: if you reboot the server (server being the whole computer?) then yes.  And, you can restart them manually if you want as well.
07:25	johannes_e	<ik>	gnomefreak , ok i barely mind DOS lol im too young for that stuff
07:26	disinterse	<ed_pe>	ok
07:26	disinterse	<ed_pe>	done
07:26	gnomefreak	< lol johannes_erik its still used in windows

07:26	johannes_e	<ik>	disinterseted_pe i tells ya what directory ur in on the left of the blinking cursor
07:26	Aeudian>	F	<annel: thanks just making sure cause i know when i reboot my server i have to manually start a Teamspeak server script just making sure the services like dns start automically =P
07:26	disinterse	<ed_pe>	yep usr$
07:27	gnomefreak	< Pyru: yw but if you add the word multiverse after the word universe you should get more ;)
07:27	johannes_e	<ik>	gnomefreak windows 2000 was the only OS i ever used :D
07:27	johannes_e	<ik>	disinterseted_pe ok type cd /usr
07:27	disinterse	<ed_pe>	cd /usr
07:27	Pyru>	heh 	< alrighty ill try it , gnomefreak also is there a way i can browse desktop themes for ubuntu?
07:27	Flannel>	A	<udian: yeah, teamspeak didn't automatically start?  Odd,  Oh, it isn't in the repositories, is it? you installed it by hand?
07:27	Aeudian>	F	<annel: yea by hand
07:27	disinterse	<ed_pe>	ok
07:27	johannes_e	<ik>	disinterseted_pe yup u type that in the terminal ? did it change ur directory ?
07:28	gnomefreak	< Pyru: system>prefference>themes in the gnome menu
07:28	Flannel>	A	<udian: that's why.  All packaged services have init.d entries, and thus get restarted and taken care of and stuff
07:28	bouncing>		<k, where is the python profiler in Ubuntu?
07:28	disinterse	<ed_pe>	still usr$
07:28	bouncing>		<reezy
07:28	Aeudian>	F	<annel: cool anything in the init.d folder auto starts? didnt know that
07:28	Pyru>	gnom	<freak, is there available downloads , so i have more of a selection
07:28	johannes_e	<ik>	type cd on its own
07:29	johannes_e	<ik>	disinterseted_pe did that change the dir ?
07:29	roryy>	bou	<cing: python2.4-profiler   (it's in multiverse)
07:29	bouncing>		<oryy: No, it isn't.
07:29	disinterse	<ed_pe>	now its just $
07:29	Aeudian>	F	<annel: so question if i put the script that i ./teamspeak start into the init.d folder would ts auto start?
07:29	johannes_e	<ik>	ahh movment :D
07:29	bouncing>		<oryy: It's referenced from multiverse, but is missing
07:29	roryy>	heh	<
07:29	Flannel>	A	<udian: well, its a little more complicated than that, but in a nutshell.  Those init.d scripts can also be used to restart any servers, like sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart would restart apache.
07:29	roryy>	ah,	<ok
07:29	s|k>	anyon	< here know anything about PHP5's SoapClient? I can't get it to work with Google's web api :/
07:29	gnomefreak	< Pyru: yes you can check in synaptic theres some there also gnome-look.org also you can install gnome-art and with that no website needed it grabs the stuff off of art.gnome.com
07:30	Flannel>	A	<udian: I dont know about that.  You might google a bit, or take a look, and see if theyre similar in structure.
07:30	johannes_e	<ik>	now cd /usr
07:30	Pyru>	so i	<would do an apt-get install gnome-art ?

04:21	Manag04 co	<ox: netstat tells you how your programs think they're talking to the outside world.  nmap tells you how the outside world views you on some interface.  If you want to know how someone views you, i.e. over your ethernet card, probing the loopback interface isn't really helpful.

04:29	cocox04Man	<gu, amphi, what'd be the difference between 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.1.2 both refers to my ethernet card isnt it ?

04:29	jksd>04imb	<ri: mean/meant
04:29	Manag04 co	<ox: nope
04:29	amphi04coc	<x: it could be that nmap is only seeing things listening on 127.0.0.1, and you have something[s]  only listening on external address[es]  and not on the loopback
04:29	Desh>04k s	<avik, I accidentaly changed my primary user to sudo, it made my normal user unusable since sudo and su did not work. Now I made my primary user group the same as my username, and added admin in the secondary group because only then would sudo and su work. But now they do not ask for a pass.
04:29	tsume04fra	<tic: hmm, maybe I need to create a separate partition for /boot

05:38	bakura82>		<ritium: I am having issues installing breezy.  unless i can' slow down the install, i can't see what teh last line was during the initialization taht cause the problem
05:38	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: then you'll need to upgrade your kernel
05:38	abarbaccia	< sparkleytone: there is no way to use that module with the older kernel?
05:38	tritium>	b	<kura82: ah, I see
05:38	CyberDoo>		< want to use Ekiga, the gnomemeeting replacement. New libraries are needed todo this. One library is and upgrade to the h323 library. If I remove this, gnomemeeting complains. If I remove gnomemeeting then it wants to remove ubuntudesktop which I don't want to remove. How can I suppress the unmet dependancy problems?
05:39	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: you'll need to go to the new source, make menuconfig, then import the old config and enable the new module
05:39	abarbaccia	< okay - i see what you're saying
05:39	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: there are ways, but they are unreliable at best
05:39	abarbaccia	< build the new kernel with my old config
05:39	Heath>	Man	<gu: what is prerm script?
05:39	tritium>	C	<berDoo: it'll be in dapper.  Hang tight for 8 or 9 days.
05:39	bakura82>		<ritium: no ideas then, huh?  :/
05:39	Managu>	He	<th: well, more radical still.  Do this -- "sudo rm -f /etc/init.d/cman; sudo touch /etc/init.d/cman;"  Then try purging again
05:39	abarbaccia	< but enable the module...
05:39	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: also...if its a distro-supplied kernel...cross-versioning modules is probably not enabled
05:39	eddiestone	< when a function f1 calls another function f2 from inside a try block, and an exception is throwed from f2, the function f1 gets no exception...
05:39	Managu>	he	<th: a prerm script is a program that's run to prepare your system for removing that package
05:39	abarbaccia	< sparkleytone: they are the breezy and dapper kernels
05:40	CyberDoo>		<ritium: Okay. I'll do that. No biggee. Thanks.
05:40	slavik>	sp	<rkleytone: k
05:40	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: ya...shouldn't cause problems...just make sure that if you currently boot to an initrd image to build a new initrd too

05:40	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: which means yeah they are initrd images...you'll want to install kernel-package
05:40	sakka>	yes	<sir?
05:40	slavik>	Py	<u: with ./ in beginning and in the directory of the untarred tar?
05:40	bakura82>		<ritium:  I can't manage to see WHAT the last line was that may have caused the hang.
05:40	slavik>	sa	<ka: that is one problem ...
05:40	Heath>	Man	<gu: when I did thos commands it just went to the next line
05:41	Managu>	he	<th: then try purging again
05:41	abarbaccia	< sparkleytone: see, i can't just upgrade to dapper because the fglrx module won't load DRM (i think its a bug) but breezy has no problems
05:41	bakura82>		<eath said bad burn, so I am also burning a new disk to see if maybe thats the prblem
05:41	sparkleyto	<e>	abarbaccia: and once you configure the kernel, you'll make-kpkg --initrd binary

07:46	Thlayli>	i	<just read the the ubuntu website
07:46	nanotube>		<hlayli, about 700 people :)
07:46	Thlayli>	i	<m wondering whether i should try it

07:47	nanotube>		<hlayli, well, if you are happy with freebsd, why switch?
07:47	sakka>	rre	<d4: i think im using a linux driver?
07:47	Madpilot>		<hlayli, you're going to get a biased answer here - this is #ubuntu, after all ;)
07:47	Thlayli>	W	<ll, there are some issues
07:47	Thlayli>	e	<g. the java support
07:47	Thlayli>	s	<pport for macromedia flash
07:47	nanotube>		<hlayli, unless freebsd is lacking some features/capabilities that you want, no reason to do other os
07:47	Thlayli>	i	<m limited with multimedia things
07:47	dust>	c'mo	< someone must know something about BusID. a room full o' smart fellas (gender neutral) like ya'll
07:47	matheus>	a	<yone know a program to load apps in notification area???
07:47	DBO>	Thlay	<i, ubuntu is fairly well supported and sports the debian package scheme (being debian based) which makes things much more slick for installing
07:47	rredd4>	sa	<ka, where did you get the driver from
07:47	Thlayli>	t	<day i wanted to install ethereal, and recognized the port is broken :(
07:47	nanotube>		<hlayli, ah hmm ic. well, you could try. just set off a partition for ubuntu, and do a dualboot.
07:48	Thlayli>	i	<m not a fan of dual boot
07:48	DBO>	mathe	<s, do a google search on trayitall
07:48	Thlayli>	i	<d have some questions in particular
07:48	nanotube>		<hlayli, well, throw out your questions, and we will see :)
07:48	Thlayli>	i	<didn't find a website where all packages are listed that ubuntu installs by default

07:49	Thlayli>	d	<es ubuntu offer any kind of encrypted file-system like GELI or GBDE?
07:49	slackern>		<hlayli: You could always do a server install that will give you a minial install without a graphical interface and build from that.

09:26	<`qq`>	Taru, how do you enter this channel?
09:26	freakabcd>	<Kane666, i dunno if it will solve the problem, but it will flush all the firewall rules. i.e. you're machine will not have a firewall (untill rebooted or firewall started manually)

09:27	kuja>	Taru	< Okay, this is what you should do -- Reboot, and press ESC real fast before Linux boots (when it's giving the littler timer). Then chooser the Recovery Mode, and edit /etc/hosts (sudo nano /etc/hosts) so that your hostname is in it (I think you set it up as "ubuntu"). Mine looks like this: "127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost       shugotenshi", so yours should be similar.

02:14	ic56>02acu	<aich: ok. To briefly explain what we did: /etc/init.d is where the reference copy of every startup script is kept.  The scripts aren't actually invoked from that directory.  That's just the central place where they're kept.  The rc.d directories are where you put scripts that you actually want executed.  Each of these directories is used for a different "run level".  For example, booting in single-user mode, puts you

02:15	Clint02 :(	<
02:15	ic56>02acu	<aich: when you proceed to go into multiuser mode, without the GUI, you go into runlevel 2.  When the GUI starts, you're in level 3.  To ensure the fan is turned on regardless of which level you're booting to, we created links to the script from each of the directories.

The number after the initial letter tells the init daemon in what sequence to invoke the scripts. Numbers are 00 - 99.

07:25	Elmore>	so	<ry don't no how
07:25	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, when i typed adduser chris admin it came back "group 'admin' does not exist" ... whats that supposed to mean?
07:25	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  i messed up the install.. i need to uninstall it
07:25	paradizelo	<t>	and it's vmware-uninstall.pl
07:25	rredd4>	Co	<mander, you should be able to click on the cd
07:25	Hexidigita	<>	ah
07:25	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: you just re-do the install, it'll over write
07:26	Commander-	<rowe>	ok
07:26	Commander-	<rowe>	gotta go
07:26	rredd4>	by	<
07:26	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, that something is badly wrong with your install of Ubuntu, I suspect...
07:26	Commander-	<rowe>	tty all tomarow
07:26	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  i get an unable to execute error
07:26	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: and not ./vmware-uninstall.pl -   from a terminal it's only        # vmware-uninstall.pl
07:26	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: are you running as root?
07:26	Hexidigita	<>	yes
07:26	MorbidHung	<r>	yeah well im going to bed guys
07:26	paradizelo	<t>	using sudo or logged in as?
07:27	crimsun>	M	<rbidHunger: are you testing dapper, or is this with breezy?
07:27	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, if this is a new install, I'd think of reinstalling - I think you broke something, and that might be the simplest fix... (it's a drastic fix, but...)
07:27	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, I foolishly did a manual install because i was trying to save files from windows but ended up losing them anyway, should i just re do the install but this time the default / automatic install?
07:27	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: and EXACTLY what command are you typing?
07:27	rredd4>	is	<5 gigs enough for ubuntu partition?  dual boot
07:27	MorbidHung	<r>	i think breezy
07:27	MorbidHung	<r>	but im going to bed
07:27	crimsun>	M	<rbidHunger: please test with current dapper when you can.
07:27	MorbidHung	<r>	ill just install fedora
07:27	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, the default install can do partitioning too, so you can save your Windows partitions
07:27	crimsun>	o	< do that, whatever floats your boat.
07:27	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, did you do an "expert" install?
07:27	MorbidHung	<r>	yeah
07:27	MorbidHung	<r>	thanx though
07:27	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, yes i did

07:27	MorbidHung	<r>	ill ttyl to u guys later
07:27	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  ^^
07:27	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, OK, just a sec. That I know how to fix.
07:28	Madpilot>		<botu, tell CCcRocK about expert
07:28	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: what is the path, do a pwd
07:28	Corey>	nea	<ly done downloading ET :)

07:29	MorbidHung	<r>	could ubuntu not have installed something i needed?
07:29	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  i renamed it, for ease of typing
07:29	paradizelo	<t>	k.
07:29	MorbidHung	<r>	aparently i dont have sequencer
07:29	paradizelo	<t>	k.  do an ls -al |grep pl

07:30	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, but do i replace you_normal_username with 'chris'?
07:30	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, yes
07:31	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  do you want to know that whole string?
07:31	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  nevermind, i see it
07:31	paradizelo	<t>	just the first part, before it says root
07:31	paradizelo	<t>	what's the mode?
07:31	paradizelo	<t>	what part were you having a problem w/ on install?
07:32	paradizelo	<t>	you'll need to have installed      build-essential, xinetd, linux-headers-{uname -r}
07:32	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  i didn't install the kernel headers, so i was stuck in one part
07:32	ubuntu>	hi	<there.. how to install stuff o ubuntu..
07:32	ubuntu>	i 	<ealli am new
07:32	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: ten you don't need to do that much of a reinstall
07:32	paradizelo	<t>	just install the headers and run
07:33	paradizelo	<t>	# vmware-config.pl
07:33	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  i hope :)  thanks for your help!
07:33	paradizelo	<t>	it will run you through the config again
07:33	paradizelo	<t>	i use vmware-server on EVERY box i have.
07:33	Madpilot>		<buntu, start at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SynapticHowto
07:33	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, alright thanks again i'll be back
07:33	paradizelo	<t>	so i'm very familiar w/ the install process.
07:33	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, luck
07:33	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  if i can only get my broadcom drivers to work on my laptop...  :(
07:33	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: wireless i take it?
07:33	Hexidigita	<>	yep
07:33	Ademan>	wh	<t IS the getty proccess?
07:33	paradizelo	<t>	give dapper a shot, a lot of stuff works in dapper that didn't in breezy
07:34	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: that's your consoles
07:34	MorbidHung	<r>	dont have a dapper cd
07:34	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  i'm on dapper
07:34	ubuntu>	th	<nk ahh
07:34	yappa>	Bro	<dcom for my Linksys worked in dapper but not breezy
07:34	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: ahh. k.  then TECHNICALLY.... you were in the wrong room.....
07:34	Madpilot>		<orbidHunger, if you've got a Breezy install, you can upgrade it to Dapper
07:34	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: well... uh... i have like 7 instances of that... (not windows, just the proccess) does that mean those threads are orphans? and should be killed?
07:35	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: no, you have 6 consoles usually
07:35	Madpilot>		<deman, no, the gettys like to hang out in groups. there's a reason, but I can't remember what it is... ;)
07:35	Hexidigita	<>	:) paradizelost but why go in there... only 9 days left
07:35	paradizelo	<t>	ctrl+alt+F1-F7
07:35	paradizelo	<t>	F6
07:35	MorbidHung	<r>	how do i do that?
07:35	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: true true.
07:36	paradizelo	<t>	not like there's anyone in there atm anyways...
07:36	Madpilot>		<botu, tell MorbidHunger about upgrade
07:36	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  210... still more than the Windows rooms :-D
07:36	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: 210, but 95% idle
07:36	Hexidigita	<>	hehe
07:37	phrowzen>		<havo, around?
07:37	MorbidHung	<r>	wats the diffrence?
07:37	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: also, whatever you do, do NOT run vmware w/ the sudo command
07:37	chavo>	im 	<ere
07:37	phrowzen>		<havo, mind if i PM?
07:37	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  breaks stuff?
07:37	chavo>	go 	<head
07:37	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: well, i CAN't shutdown right now, the menu doesnt have that option, so i assume some other user (probably root) has a proccess running that ubuntu thinks should not be interrupted
07:37	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: yes.  then you get to delete your vmware preferences file
07:37	Hexidigita	<>	sounds like fun
07:37	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: what error are you getting?
=== ubuntu is now known as SyNitE
07:38	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: if you hopen a terminal and do a sudo init 0
07:38	SyNitE>	CA	< ubuntu support wireless card?
07:38	paradizelo	<t>	it should shut down no matter what is going on
07:38	paradizelo	<t>	SyNitE: yes, depends on the card though
07:38	MorbidHung	<r>	it says its up to date
07:38	SyNitE>	wh	<t if it a usb adapter?
07:38	paradizelo	<t>	SyNitE: depends on the card
07:38	paradizelo	<t>	what chipset?
=== nalioth is now known as nalioth_zZz
07:38	paradizelo	<t>	MorbidHunger: are you trying to upgrade to dapper?
07:39	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, success!
07:39	MorbidHung	<r>	indeed
07:39	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, excellent!
07:39	paradizelo	<t>	MorbidHunger: have you EVER used automatix on this system?
07:39	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, haha thank you so much, you wouldnt happen to know how to enable dual monitors now would you ?
07:39	voraistos>	<curse automatix
07:39	MorbidHung	<r>	no
07:39	MorbidHung	<r>	never heard of it
07:40	paradizelo	<t>	MorbidHunger: well, then, NEVER use it.  it breaks many things
07:40	paradizelo	<t>	including the updates
07:40	MorbidHung	<r>	ok
07:40	paradizelo	<t>	!upgrade
07:40	ubotu>	fro	< memory, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
07:40	MorbidHung	<r>	is there like a cd image i can dl?
07:40	Flannel>	M	<rbidHunger: EasyUbuntu is better for that sort of thing.
07:40	paradizelo	<t>	you did the gksudo "update-manager -d" right?
07:40	Madpilot>		<CcRocK, nope, sorry. Hang out here and ask again in a bit, there's lots of other dual monitor users
07:40	paradizelo	<t>	!easyubuntu
07:40	ubotu>	it 	<as been said that easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
07:40	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: well no its just the OPTION to shutdown is not there, not that i CANT (i'm sure from the console i could)
07:40	MorbidHung	<r>	easy ubuntu?
07:40	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, I had them running in windows, then when i made the switch to ubuntu one of them just stopped displaying anything
07:41	CCcRocK>	M	<dpilot, alright thanks anyway
07:41	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: are you using KDE w/ the GDM login manager?
07:41	mustard5>		<deman, are you on gnome and when you choose the logout option the menu fails to appear?
07:41	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: or Gnome w/ the KDM login manager?
07:41	Ademan>	ju	<t what mustard said
07:41	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: no i think i'm gnome with gdm
07:42	mustard5>		<deman, this happens to me on occasion..and I just open another window....like a folder or a terminal and the menu 'appears'
07:42	yappa>	Sin	<e nobody is in the xubuntu room...  does anyone know if Xubuntu is going to be released along-side dapper?
07:42	Madpilot>		<appa, I think so, yes
07:42	yappa>	swe	<et
07:42	Ademan>	i 	<ave 2 instances of gdm if that means anything
07:42	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital: did you get vmware working yet?
07:42	mustard5>		<deman, that sounds interesting hehe
07:42	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: that is typical
07:42	paradizelo	<t>	i have the same
07:43	Hexidigita	<>	paradizelost::  entering my key now :) much further than before

07:47	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: is this the original created user?

07:47	eumario>	T	<ru: Which Burning program are you looking for?
07:47	mustard5>		<deman, how did you start the xserver?
07:47	paradizelo	<t>	using apt-get install?
07:47	Madpilot>		<aru, Applications->Accessories->Terminal doesn't work?
07:47	paradizelo	<t>	Taru: try alt+f2 then type in xterm
07:47	Taru>	I ju	<t downloaded XCDroast.
07:48	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: yes
07:48	paradizelo	<t>	Taru: i recommend k3b
07:48	Ademan>	mu	<tard5: on startup
07:48	eumario>	T	<ru: Is it a .deb package?
07:48	eumario>	T	<ru: Or a .tar.gz package?
07:48	Ademan>	mu	<tard5: but i've been trying to shut it down through the console and i might have screwed things up
07:48	Taru>	euma	<io, tar.gz
07:48	Madpilot>		<aru, try just putting a blank CD in your burner - you should get a popup asking what you want to do with it
07:48	Taru>	Madp	<lot, nope
07:48	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: did you do any messing w/ the gdm configuration options?
07:48	Ademan>	mu	<tard5: i know i tried "sudo startx --help" and it created an "authorization something or other"
07:48	mustard5>		<deman, what have you tried in console?
07:48	varsendagg	<r>	Madpilot, i need a realtively fast computer that has windows to test some stuff
07:48	Taru>	Madp	<lot, It is a CD-RW and I want to format then use it to burn
07:49	mikebot>	w	<at does this mean: "** Closing Connection: Unable to transfer data (Broken pipe)"
07:49	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: i edited some resolutions in xorg.conf, which was why i wanted to restart x in the first place
07:49	mustard5>		<deman, I'm wondering whether you started the xserver with startx, and when you logout it will just drop you back to gdm or console
07:49	Madpilot>		<aru, for CD-RW I think you might need k3b - install it thru Synaptic or "sudo apt-get install k3b"
07:49	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: FYI, if you change the config, NEVER run startx with sudo
07:49	eumario>	T	<ru: Ctrl+Alt+F1, cd <directory where you have it>, tar -xzf xcdroast-x.x.x.tar.gz  (Where the x.x.x is the version number of the one you downloaded), cd xcdroast-x.x.x, ./configure, make, sudo make install
07:49	MorbidHung	<r>	how is this gonna make my comp better?
07:49	paradizelo	<t>	actually NEVER run startx w/ sudo anyways
07:49	yappa>	So 	<ill most people stick with Dapper as a "stable" release until eft gets its feet planted firmly on the ground?
07:49	Madpilot>		<aru, but if you can't use the menu items in Ubuntu, there's something broken in your install...
07:50	paradizelo	<t>	you will hose your .Xauthority and .ICEauthority files
07:50	Taru>	Madp	<lot, synaptic dont work either.
07:50	Taru>	euma	<io, ok
07:50	Madpilot>		<aru, then something is badly wrong with your install. Did you do a default install?
07:50	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: do a sudo rm -Rf ~/.Xauthority ~/.ICEauthority
07:50	paradizelo	<t>	scuse me, leave the R off of that
07:50	Taru>	Madp	<lot, yeah my ubuntu linux is screwed, i want to reinstall it, but to do that I need a fresh cd of ubuntu, not corrupted
07:50	mustard5>		<deman, from console you should be able to shutdown with ...  shutdown now -h
07:51	Taru>	Madp	<lot, i had a few errors during first installation.
07:51	Taru>	Madp	<lot, maybe the cd, so i am trying ot burn onto a new cd.
07:51	paradizelo	<t>	mustard5: i'm betting his .Xauthority and such are messed up so it's not recognizing that he has permission to do those things
07:51	mustard5>		<aradizelost, k
07:51	paradizelo	<t>	i'd bet he gets logged off he won't be able to log in
07:52	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: fyi, if you simply want to restart the X server, CTRL+ALT+Backspace is sufficient
07:52	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: it never worked for me... lol
07:52	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: were you by chance trying to get Xgl working?
07:52	Ademan>	ha	<a no
07:53	Ademan>	i 	<as just sick of 1900x1200
07:53	Ademan>	an	< i knew i had 1600x1024 but it wasnt in the config, so i added it
07:53	Taru>	Madp	<lot, It says "sudo: unable to lookup via gethostbyname()"
07:53	CCcRocK>	D	<es anyone know how to enable dualies? I had dual monitors running in windows then i switched to Ubuntu and the second one is now disabled, how can i change that?
07:53	mustard5>		<aru, I know that error well :)
07:53	paradizelo	<t>	Taru: you need to make sure your hostname is in /etc/hosts
07:53	Taru>	must	<rd5, o.O
07:53	Taru>	para	<izelost, How?
07:54	mustard5>		<aru, see paradizelost's comment
07:54	paradizelo	<t>	you'll need to get logged in w/ root privileges somehow, probably boot to rescue mode, and edit /etc/hosts
07:54	mustard5>		<aru, most likely you will need to boot up in recovery mode..if you haven't set a root password
07:54	mustard5>		<aru, I can pastebin instructions if you want...
07:54	Taru>	must	<rd5, root password is set, but it says denied access even in root but not in safemode
07:54	mustard5>		<aru, I've got them all written out already
07:54	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: is there an alternative to ctrl+alt+backspace ? i assume its cause i have a laptop keyboard and they're screwy, but that doesnt work for me
07:55	Taru>	must	<rd5, sure :D
07:55	mustard5>		<aru, ok..hang ten..I'll be back
07:55	Taru>	must	<rd5, ok :D
07:55	paradizelo	<t>	Ademan: it will always work unless you change the default config
07:55	paradizelo	<t>	make sure you are actually using control not fn
07:56	_smd_>	Is 	<here another email program I can use other than evolution?
07:56	paradizelo	<t>	Taru: did you use sudo su  - to set the root password? or are you talking the pass. you set on install?
07:56	Madpilot>		<smd_, Thunderbird?
07:56	Flannel>	_	<md_: thunderbird.  mutt, there are tons!
07:56	paradizelo	<t>	_smd_: only a few thousand
07:56	Ademan>	pa	<adizelost: yep, and i havent touched that config

08:35	Taru>	ic56	< my original install cd is corrupt, i meant to reburn it on a new cd, on this comp, but i may have ot move burner to another computer like paradizelost mentioned.

08:37	paradizelo	<t>	ubuntu: are you saying you used vmware, gave it physical access to the hard drive, and did another linux install?
08:37	paradizelo	<t>	please say no.....
08:37	ic56>	Taru	< you've done something wierd with the way you booted.  You have two filesystems overlapping each other.  I know Linux can handle this under special circumstances but I don't know if you've done it right.

08:38	Taru>	ic56	< yeah screwed up somewhere, i encountered some errors while installing it and skipping some.
08:38	paradizelo	<t>	zukero: most of the time open a terminal and do a #dmesg|grep hd

08:38	zukero>	pa	<adizelost : even if not a hd (DVD Burner)
08:38	ic56>	Taru	< is this a new install?  How did you install if you don't have a readable CD?

08:40	paradizelo	<t>	Taru: just make sure you use the same burner that you use in both comps.  i have a burner that's going out, it works fine w/ its own cd's, but if i  burn an install cd w/ it, and try to use it in another machine, it doesn't work
08:40	Schalken>		<aradizelost, this is what the SiS site has to say: "Linux Kernel 2.4.20 (Redhat 9.0) has default driver for SiS741" (my card)
08:40	Taru>	para	<izelost, ok
08:40	paradizelo	<t>	Schalken: they mean the low end, no accelleration driver.
08:40	ic56>	Taru	< do you have the option of installing something else that will let you burn CDs?  That might save you a lot of grief.
08:40	Taru>	para	<izelost, i probably will just move the burner now.
08:40	ubuntu>	wh	<t i am saying is that vmware is on bb server hda1, i did a sarge install on a small bit of my disk just to see if a howto would work some project i am going to try and but the grub back on hda1 so my server bb will maybe boot without error or good ness must phone work to get another days hoilday well thats linux

08:43	distanceis	<eath>	Is it possible to install linux on the same hd?

08:44	distanceis	<eath>	how would i go about doing this?
08:44	paradizelo	<t>	distanceisdeath: you just need to have some free space on the drive
08:44	kuja>	ic56	< Err, forgot to tell him to burn it at 2x.
08:44	paradizelo	<t>	and then you run the installer

08:45	distanceis	<eath>	do i have to burn it?
08:46	bur[n] er>	<gnuyen: i think it already did... and the kernel driver didn't get updated yet... though I'm not positive
08:46	kuja>	ic56	< Well, it's generally safer to burn at a lower speed.

09:09	paradizelo	<t>	:D
09:09	ubuntu>	re	<ember it could not write it as hda3  was bootable at the time yes hda3 is not bootable now
09:10	paradizelo	<t>	ubuntu: basically, it's like back in DOS, you did an FDISK but had to reboot before the system saw the change
09:10	paradizelo	<t>	ubuntu: corret
09:10	paradizelo	<t>	correct
09:10	vook>	para	<izelost, there must be a better way.
09:10	paradizelo	<t>	do a cfdisk /dev/hda again and make sure it looks like you want
09:10	Schalken>		<aradizelost, is that REALLY only way to get flash working on AMD64?
09:10	ubuntu>	ye	< that sounds correct
09:10	paradizelo	<t>	vook- it's the only way if you want flash 8 on linux
09:10	Schalken>		<aradizelost, how come SUSE can do it though?
09:10	paradizelo	<t>	Schalken: the only flash actually avaialable for linux is 7 or lower
09:10	vook>	I do	<'t think so, I know it can be done.
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	there is no flash8 for linux.
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	look all you want
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	you can get flash 7
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	i'm not just talking amd64 either
09:11	ubuntu>	so	<lets asume that hda1 is now bootable
09:11	Schalken>		<aradizelost, well can flash 7 be used on AMD64?
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	ubuntu: then reboot
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	Schalken: never tried it....
09:11	vook>	para	<izelost, i understand that, but there must be a way to get it going in firefox on amd64 without wine.
09:11	paradizelo	<t>	:D
09:11	Schalken>		<mmm

09:20	tin_nqn>	t	<anks
09:21	paradizelo	<t>	tonyyarusso: you could write a script to start the program, track the pid, then have a cron job kill the pid at a specified time
09:21	paradizelo	<t>	but that would kill it not pause it
09:22	tonyyaruss	<>	paradizelost: Well, aptitude seems to be smart enough to resume where it left of with package downloading.
09:22	paradizelo	<t>	tonyyarusso: then that might be the way to go
09:22	tonyyaruss	<>	paradizelost: All right, we'll give it a shot.
09:22	paradizelo	<t>	it'll be a fun script though.....
09:22	Schalken>		<aradizelost: so, flash can be used on AMD64 by replacing 64bit firefox with a 32bit one?
09:23	paradizelo	<t>	Schalken: i would think so
09:23	paradizelo	<t>	you can run both types of binaries IIRC
09:23	Schalken>		<aradizelost, do you think that would work with w32codecs?
09:23	paradizelo	<t>	possibly
09:23	paradizelo	<t>	but the codecs will involve the player more than the browser

I can print to it fine using any gnome-friendly app that will see my cups printers, but AcroRead wants me to specify a command to run, and I can't get lp/lpr or anything to print properly through my cups-enabled printers. Is there some sort of wrapper that will take lp commands and send them through cups?

12:41	njan>12har	<esJacobs, but last I looked there are data recovery tools for ext3, and if you're properly administrating a system you should never accidentally delete backups, so journaling is more of an issue. Like all things, it's all about priorities ;)

01:11	bimbe01>	A	<rick: not too bad, yourself?
01:11	holly01odb	< will running a k7 kernel over 686 actually make any difference when packages aren't compiled for k7 ?

01:12	Drake01 if	<you use recursive with wget it gets everything above the directory how do you use wget to get everything that is at a certain directory and below?
01:12	Flann01>	h	<llywoodb: ah.  The kernel changes are mostly for the kernel, so the kernel will use optomizations for that particular processor.  Programs are usually compiled for 386, and then kernel things.
01:13	linch01s>		<y NTFS partition is mounted in /tmp/disks-conf-sda1 but I can only browse it as root, how do I change that?
01:13	theCo01>	A	<rick: fyi, my nick come from a game, which got me into programming and art.
01:13	holly01odb	< Flannel: right, but if a package is compiled for 386, it isn't going to call on those extensions/optimizations anyways, correct?
01:13	linch01s>		<ts mounted using disks-admin
01:14	Flann01>	h	<llywoodb: no no.  Kernels all provide the same interface, but internally thigns go different, and thats where you get the optomizations.
01:15	theCo01>	A	<rick: not from those guys who think that it's normal that a cpu generate more heat per square inches than a stove :)
01:15	holly01odb	< Flannel: ah, perhaps I'll switch from 686 to k7 then one of these days... I'm still dealing with running 686 on a x86_64 processor ;)

09:16	Ademan>	we	<l, debian users are elitists, so i suppose they THINK they're better
09:16	Flannel>	H	<xidigital_: well, it is nice if you have no broadband.
09:16	holycow>	i	< you put ubuntu onto cds it would be the same number as debian
09:16	Hexidigita	<_>	Flannel:: true
09:16	holycow>	b	<t no one here will long enough to actually try every single debian package
09:16	holycow>	t	<us one only needs 1 cd
09:17	spikeb>	ye	<h i've never actually used anything but a netinst cd to install debian
09:17	Flannel>	H	<xidigital_: and, no, you could download which ever CDs youd like.  CD1 was the installer, the rest were just additional packages, you could pick andchoose, etc.
09:17	Schalken>		<oes debian by itself come with a desktop environment?
09:17	achandra>		<ell according to http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major Mark Shuttleworth of Thawte fame used debian Sid to work of...is that right?
09:17	Hexidigita	<_>	Flannel:: i see... i have the net installer of debian sarge
09:17	Flannel>	S	<halken: yes.  Just like ubuntu does.
09:17	Hexidigita	<_>	i wasn't sure what those other few were for
09:17	spikeb>	ac	<andra: yes. ubuntu forks from debian sid at the beginning of every dev cycle
09:17	Flannel>	a	<handra: yes.  Ubuntu is based on debian.
09:17	holycow>	S	<halken, if you choose it in the installer
09:17	achandra>		<ice...
09:17	Flannel>	s	<ikeb: that's not entirely true.
09:18	holycow>	u	<untu isn't exactly a fork
09:18	achandra>		<re there any ubuntu developers here?
09:18	holycow>	i	< just freezes debian unstable every 6 months
09:18	Healot>	ba	<ed, not fork or sister project
09:18	spikeb>	it	<does a LOT more than freeze it
09:18	Hexidigita	<_>	there is no spoon
09:19	holycow>	s	<re but its not really a separate distro in the sense that other debian forks are
09:19	achandra>		<ve been playing quite a bit with openser and asterisk..and was wondering if there is port to ubuntu...
09:19	spikeb>	ho	<ycow just because it forks more than once doesn't make it a spoon ;)
09:19	spikeb>	br	<
09:19	holycow>	t	<ere was some controversy early on about why wasn't ubuntu a debian subproject
09:19	elknof1>	h	<alot, i've done that, the dir is already mounted...  but i've no idea how to play it with mplayer... it just dont open the file
09:20	achandra>		<olycow: it point blanck says on distrowatch one of the reasons..to have a seperate type project was to eliminate and fix the mistakes people were making with large scale distros..
09:20	Flannel>	a	<handra: asterisk is in ubuntu repositories, yes. openser isnt.
09:20	achandra>		<nce again...nice
09:21	holycow>	i	<don't see that anywhere on the official ubuntu wiki
09:21	Schalken>		<s anyone here getting a Dapper CD shipped to them?
09:21	disinteres	<ed_pe>	y when i run apt-get upate does it say im locked out?
09:21	achandra>		< also like the fact that root is disabled by default and you have to use sudo...very very nice..

09:25	holycow>	a	<d i haveto say that its great that mark has decided to spend enough money to polish off debian so to speak
09:25	holycow>	u	<untu is what a debian desktop would be, if debian had 3 mil per year to spend on the polish
09:26	achandra>		<nteresting...
09:26	holycow>	a	<tually, i guess it takes a lot more elbow grea$e to make a good desktop than i originally thought with just good ol debian
09:26	Flannel>	h	<lycow: eh, desktop polish isn't nearly as important as the userbase (that helps, instead of 'RTFM's)

03:33	Dr_Wi03is>	<theres lots of little annoying problems with using the 64bit disrtos. :( flash, and other annoyances.
03:33	gnome03eak	< Khamael: because gaim didnt make the msn name for you you have to make another account iirc
03:33	mdebo03>	D	<_Willis: right.
03:33	njan>03deb	<er, last time I checked, i386 was quite a bit more userfriendly, since 64-bit distros have problems with binary software not designed for 64-bit systems.
03:33	njan>03deb	<er, flash being one example of that..
03:33	Khama03>	A	<swer: yes, but all my evil little friends are using it
03:33	Healo03 it	<isn't about friendliness
03:33	mdebo03>	r	<ght, flash is definitely something he wants to use
03:33	Answe03 Kh	<mael, well msn has proprietary protocols which gaim was able to figure out for chatting, but not for updating account info
03:34	Healo03 it	<s about programmers who are not willing to write/compile 64bit applications
03:34	Answe03 64	<it is the koolest
03:34	njan>03eal	<t, which causes the OS not to be friendly.

03:34	Dr_Wi03is>	<ive seen little gains for my needs from using 64bit
03:34	Khama03>	A	<swer: ok. just found out that amsn does change names.. but it`s ugly
03:34	njan>03eal	<t, since it requires work and/or knowledge in order to actually get a 64-bit distribution working to the same extent that the 32-bit one is out of the box.
03:34	runes03mde	<oer how did oyu get dapper

03:35	mdebo03>	o	<ay, this confirms my thoughts.
03:35	njan>03eal	<t, I'm not blaming it, and I'm not expecting anything. I'm just saying that it's easier to use a 32-bit distro
03:35	dsl9503 Kh	<mael, what about changing name with amsn and then using gaim?
03:35	sugor03o>		<i all
03:35	njan>03eal	<t, there's no scurrying about to find alternative clients, and no chrooting to use 32-bit libraries for things that don't have or like 64-bit ones.
03:35	Healo03 nj	<n, there are workarounds though...
03:35	gnome03eak	< biggest issues with 64bit and ppc is the non-free apps/programs are not writen for them due to lack of users
03:36	Healo03 th	<ngs will change eventually
03:36	runes03gno	<efreak seems like intel and amd are pusing the 64 bit architecture
03:36	njan>03eal	<t, Yes, there are workarounds. But like I said at the very beginning of this thread, it's *less* userfriendly, and the dude was asking about a system for his non-linux-savvy-friend.
03:36	sugor03o>		<'m installing dapper flight7 on a vaio and i want to get it set up with codecs and most desktop stuff
03:36	Khama03>	d	<l957: that seems to be the only way. no prob for me, because I seldom change, but what about jou user? who wants to have everything work with one client?

03:36	runes03you	<d think they would just write the apps to support eh platform?

12:30	Rubin12HaI	<, ahh ha, how do you know 'eth0' is the correct one?

12:30	HaIx>12th0	<is onboard...
12:30	Rubin12HaI	<, yes, but maybe eth0 and eth1 got swapped around
12:30	andre12w>		<ey guys
12:30	petri12 mi	<imec, Besides you need to learn somehow. Maybe I should wait for Dapper and hope that resolves it

12:31	Rubin12HaI	<, eth0 is whichever driver loads first.. so those arnt guaranteed to be the same across diff kernel configs
12:31	HaIx>12ubi	<, o ok..
12:31	HaIx>12ubi	<, so remove the other nic?
12:31	nickr12>	f	<rous, yeah, they are all the same. I had serious problems with that, it's good it worked for you :)
12:31	Rubin12HaI	<, quick fix, edit /etc/network/interface and change all the eth0 to eth1
12:31	Rubin12HaI	<, then do ifup eth1
12:32	HaIx>12ubi	<, ok..

12:33	Rubin12mir	<nda82, should be right there in system ->	prefs
12:33	ihave12iru	<>	thanks nickrud :D;)
12:33	nickr12>	s	<ian, you have high bandwidth, it might be simpler to download the kubuntu desktop
12:33	miran1282>	<Rubin, that's the point i haven't got it
12:33	blaze12no 	<haveavirus i haven't
12:33	Rubin12mir	<nda82, maybe it isnt installed. try apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
12:33	petri12 mi	<imec, Another goal is to get some of my directories moved to other partions and drives. That also is going to require some research into linux filesystem structure
12:33	ihave12iru	<>	do that first blaze
12:33	nickr12>	s	<ian, CD I mean
12:34	Haydr12 I 	<ad the ATI 8.24 drivers working, but the latest came out, and I am missing a shared library, libfglrx_pp.so.1 so they won't run, any ideas on how to fix it?

12:34	Rubin12pet	<ik, you should avoid that stuff until you are really good with linux IMO
12:34	miran1282>	<Rubin, I installed from flight cd 6

12:35	Jazzn12e>		<K merci,gracias,thanks, but how i get to TYPING IN TERMINAL??
12:35	Rubin12pet	<ik, you dont even really unedrstand what SHOULD be on its own partitions and things until you have used it a while

12:35	lmira12a>		<hcp ?
12:35	Rubin12pet	<ik, read a lot, and explore your filesystem, figure out what everything in /usr/bin does, for example. read about what /usr and /usr/bin and /bin and /lib and all those are for.
12:36	minim12>	p	<trik: Are you thinking about some kind of server-client structure or do you just want to seperate different kinds of data to seperate partitions?
12:36	HymnT12ife	< lmiranda>	then the "poor modem drivrs" option is wrong

12:37	nickr12>	s	<ian, no way to burn a cd?
12:37	Rubin12geo	<ge_, debian packages often just work, but you should get the ubuntu ported versions if available. rpm, google 'alien'
12:37	blaze12iha	<eavirus, they are 30 mb each :D
12:37	blaze12i h	<pe it works..
12:37	stian12nic	<rud: just on this ubuntu computer :)

12:38	phibx12 Ja	<znite, command line interface? try gnome-terminal.
12:38	Rubin12pet	<ik, i like to make a directory called /data on another drive, and then i make dirs there for anything i want to keep, and symlink that to the real filesystem where things i want to not loose go (for example /home and /var/lib/mysql)
12:39	iwkse12iha	<eavirus: linux = kernel
12:39	petri12 Cu	<rently I have a 20GB drive which ubuntu formated with 240MB for itself and left the rest blank and unformatted

03:56	nickr03_>		<nazad, I've use lilo a lot, but the grub installer in ubuntu is reasonably intelligent. I'm just saying that unless you have a good reason, why not use it?
03:57	smeac03rne	< Madpilot - nothing wrong with it at all... so long as the Ubuntu project would see money from its sales
03:57	Inaza03 ni	<krud_, grub it's ugly.. lol I want a beautiful loader
03:57	bla|p03ric	<>	Malikith: well i cant fight against sleep much longer :/
03:57	HymnT03ife	< roostishaw>	yes, and since you need access to it al the time, you'll have it mounted all the time :)
03:57	smeac03rne	< what I meant... is that I wouldn't want to be providing CompUSA with discs for them to sell and keep all the money
03:57	bla|p03ric	<>	any idea?
03:57	nickr03_>		<nazad, then have fun. It's linux :)
03:57	dli>	03eac	<erne, that's why I think people can creat a business out of ubuntu, it's so useful to most home users
03:57	parad03elo	<t>	smeacterne: so sell them to them
03:57	bla|p03ric	<>	well thank you everybody until now for ur help :D
03:57	Inaza03 ni	<krud_, ya.. i know, but where I can find some doc about changing the boot loader ?
03:58	parad03elo	<t>	and donate a part of the profits to canonical
03:58	Gr3ml03_>		<i
03:58	tonyy03uss	<>	smeacterne: Yeah, charge CompUSA and send the money back to the Ubuntu Foundation.
03:58	roost03haw	< HymnToLife, ok... hmm... so then whenever I needed to reinstall, I would tell the installer to only install to the "system" partition?
03:58	Gr3ml03_>		<here are vmware images of the latest ubuntu?
03:58	nickr03_>		<nazad, google lilo heaven, it's easily adapted
03:58	orbin03Ina	<ad: it lasts 5 seconds :)  then you have usplash to look at
03:58	HymnT03ife	< Inazad>	during Ubuntu install you can choose to install LILO insted of GRUB but it' a bit hidden
03:58	Inaza03 ni	<krud_, I type "lilo heaven" ?
03:58	smeac03rne	< paradizelost - was thinking possibly of something like that... should I contact the project regarding getting authorization to do something like that, as well as estimating a market price?
03:59	HymnT03ife	< roostishaw>	exactly, ad keep the /home untouched so all your files and setting will stil be there
03:59	parad03elo	<t>	smeacterne: there is no authorization needed, it's GPL, i just wouldn't get the disks from shipit and go selling them
03:59	dli>	03eac	<erne, I suppose you can do that without sending money back to ubuntu
04:00	parad04elo	<t>	but legally, nothinng stops you from re-doing ubuntu your own distro, so long as you give proper credit where it is due.
04:00	bla|p04ric	<>	well.. does someone know when Malikith is online generally?
04:00	bla|p04ric	<>	i*ll be bakc tomorrow then
04:00	roost04haw	< HymnToLife, right now its all on one hdd (plus the swap). How do I do what we just described?
04:00	smeac04rne	< dli - that defeats the point - I want the money to go back to Ubuntu
04:00	fogos04ho 	<omeone knows what mean this error when installin php-gtk2 "checking for PHP executable in /usr/bin... configure: error: Could not locate PHP executable"
04:01	bla|p04ric	<>	dont they have a million dollars smeacterne
04:01	today04ult	<eader>	Gr3mlin>	google for vmware ubuntu
04:01	dli>	04eac	<erne, I understand your point, I just mean the authorization part, not really needed
04:01	bla|p04ric	<>	and a plan to conquer business?

04:01	parad04elo	<t>	Gr3ml1n you having vmware issues?
04:01	bla|p04ric	<>	with a few devs
04:02	smeac04rne	< bla|patrick - look at Red Hat's 2005 growth and earnings
04:02	smeac04rne	< as well as their P/E ration
04:02	smeac04rne	< that's the potential open-source has
04:02	smeac04rne	< I want Ubuntu to be at that point within 10 years
04:02	bla|p04ric	<>	well do u have som numbers?
04:02	nickr04_>		<VZ, it means that for some reason (possibly because you edited it) that the permissions on the file /etc/sudoer are wrong
04:02	smeac04rne	< bla|patrick - one sec... I'll grab them
04:02	dli>	04eac	<erne, I don't know business, but to me red hat really sucks with their RPM scheme
04:02	nickr04_>		<VZ, erm, /etc/sudoers
04:03	nickr04_>		<VZ, do you have a root account?
04:03	PVZ>	04ckr	<d_, erm,not exactly
04:03	nickr04_>		<VZ, good :)
04:03	parad04elo	<t>	PVZ: is this a system you are supposed to have full control over?
04:03	bla|p04ric	<>	Malikith: sorry i am overdone now... good night/evening/morning/whatever :P
04:03	smeac04rne	< dli - agreed

04:04	bla|p04ric	<>	bye
04:04	smeac04rne	< bla|patrick - bye
04:04	nickr04_>		<VZ, reboot in recovery mode, you should get a place to type coommands. If you do, type chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers , and reboot
04:04	smeac04rne	< ok guys... Red Hat's deferred revenue last year was $223.5 mil US
04:04	PVZ>	04ckr	<d_, ok,I'll do it
04:05	PVZ>	04ank	<you
04:05	smeac04rne	< 12% sequential growth
04:05	smeac04rne	< quarterly cash flow alone had 64% growth
04:05	parad04elo	<t>	smeacterne: part of what helps redhat though is that they have an industry standard linux certification
04:05	parad04elo	<t>	AND their in bed w/ ibm
04:05	disin04res	<ed_pe>	ftp://ftp.nerim.net hasnt been working any other sites where i can get w32 codecs for realplayer
04:05	smeac04rne	< it's still small for a major corporation.... but it's getting there
04:06	parad04elo	<t>	AND vmware
04:06	smeac04rne	< paradizelost - yeah... the cert is important it seems
04:06	parad04elo	<t>	disinterested_pe: you could try easyubuntu
04:06	parad04elo	<t>	!easyubuntu
04:06	ubotu04[ea	<yubuntu]  an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
04:06	smeac04rne	< I wouldn't put it out of reach for Ubuntu though
04:06	smeac04rne	< it's fesible - just now now
04:06	smeac04rne	< not now
04:06	disin04res	<ed_pe>	ive got easyubuntu installed
04:06	parad04elo	<t>	disinterested_pe: did you have it install all of the codecs?
04:07	Madpi04t>		<meacterne, #ubuntu-offtopic to continue this, please - it's interesting, but this is supposed to be a tech support channel
04:07	disin04res	<ed_pe>	idk where do i find out?
04:07	s|k>	04h
	<4:07	orbin04dis	<nterested_pe: i think they're also in seveas' repos iirc
04:07	smeac04rne	< Madpilot - no problem... sorry to spam up the channel
04:07	parad04elo	<t>	disinterested_pe: run easyubuntu and check the box.
04:07	parad04elo	<t>	:D
04:07	jdong04ore	<uo>	is there a way of getting edubuntu LTSP goodness but without the branding?
04:07	disin04res	<ed_pe>	ok
04:07	jdong04ore	<uo>	i.e. I'd like to set up an effort-free Ubuntu thin client system
04:08	parad04elo	<t>	jdong|coreduo: there's no such thing as effort-free, but LTSP should do the trick
04:08	parad04elo	<t>	check #ltsp for instructions
04:08	jdong04ore	<uo>	paradizelost: alright, I'll see what happens if I install ltsp :)
04:08	jdong04ore	<uo>	what is required on the client side?
04:09	pablo04hel	<o!
04:09	jdong04ore	<uo>	(ltsp-client. duh)
04:09	pablo04is 	<t possible to mount a ftp location?

04:10	Madpi04t>		<abo, nearly. Final release is June 1st
04:10	parad04elo	<t>	pablo: why do you want to mount an FTP server to a location on the HDD?
04:10	dli>	04blo	< why not use nfs ?
04:10	parad04elo	<t>	agrees w/ ^^^
04:10	babo>04adp	<lot: it's good to go now though right ?
04:11	pablo04par	<dizelost: what type of media is nfs?
04:11	Madpi04t>		<abo, probably, but it's still officially in beta
04:11	babo>04adp	<lot: will easyubuntu work with dapper ... ? I need to load in some propietary stuff and I don't want to wait around ...
04:11	parad04elo	<t>	NFS=Network File System
04:11	Madpi04t>		<abo, I've no idea. try #easyubuntu
04:11	parad04elo	<t>	think of it like windows shares, just for linux, and not SMBFS
04:11	babo>04k t	<anks ...
04:12	parad04elo	<t>	babo: i've used easyubuntu on dapper and it seems to work fine
04:12	babo>04ara	<izelost: cool, I need things like flash, java, skype ...
04:12	parad04elo	<t>	no notieceable side-effect though
04:12	pablo04par	<dizelost: so can you use nfs to point to an ftp location?
04:12	parad04elo	<t>	pablo: no, it is its own type
04:13	parad04elo	<t>	why do you want to mount an FTP site?
04:13	parad04elo	<t>	i've NEVER seen it done, btw
04:13	parad04elo	<t>	babo: if you want flash8 it's easy enough to do  as well, but with wine/crossoveroffice
04:13	pablo04par	<dizelost: i want to work with FTP files as if I am in a local directory.
04:13	Inaza04 Do	<s Ubuntu are bad than Debian?
04:13	parad04elo	<t>	Inazad: WTF?
04:13	parad04elo	<t>	that made no sense
04:14	Healo04 In	<zad: define: bad
04:14	parad04elo	<t>	is ubuntu worse than debian? is that what your asking?
04:14	pablo04bad	<= worse than/
04:14	babo>04ara	<izelost: I hate wine ... I just need my browser to stop crashing when it hits flash pages ... I don't really care much about flash one way or the other ...
04:14	parad04elo	<t>	babo: i've never had a browser crash because it hit a flash page and didn't have the plugin
04:14	parad04elo	<t>	what browser are you using?
04:14	Inaza04 He	<lot, causing trouble to Debian ?
04:15	Madpi04t>		<aradizelost, you can add FTP links to Nautilus - not sure if you think of that as "mounting" them or not, but it's very seamless.
04:15	parad04elo	<t>	Inazad: about as much trouble as mandrake causes redhat...
04:15	Inaza04 pa	<adizelost, I'm reading an article on the net (forum..) some guys are crazy and they hate Ubuntu... I said FU to theirself! lol
04:15	Inaza04 pa	<adizelost, I'm agree with u

04:16	babo>04ara	<izelost, firefox ... although, I happened to wipe out my /home folder a while back and had to reinstall from synaptic. I'm on 64 bit and I'm assuming that for some reason the 32 bit version of 1.0 got installed. Regardless, I'm wiping the system and starting over with dapper. I never was able to get skype to work on 64bit, even after chrooting and tracking down dependcies ...
04:16	pablo04Mad	<ilot: i'm gonna try you tip about adding ftp links to nautilus. <brb>
04:16	Inaza04 Ma	<pilot, understood

04:18	Madpi04t>		<mile, what do you mean by "tilt"?
04:19	Healo04 Sv	<n_vB: twice the ram or more would be better
04:19	parad04elo	<t>	Sven_vB: you still have  a computer w/ only 64mb ram?
04:19	parad04elo	<t>	i haven't seen one of those in a long itme
04:19	parad04elo	<t>	time
04:19	babo>04ara	<izelost: yeah, me too ... I'm trying to run a home business on this computer and I really don't need the hassle of 64bit anymore. The performance enhancement is negligible anyway IMO ...
04:19	Sven_04>	p	<radizelost: yes. it worked nice with Win2k, so i think with Debian t should work even better
04:19	K-Daw04 do	<s any1 have a good guid how to install Nvidia 386 drivers?

09:15	Terminus>		<pcguy: #ubuntu+1 till june 1
09:15	ppcguy>	ma	<y thanks guys
09:15	drumline>		<istance: it is.  :)
09:15	chrisx2>	h	<y can any1 help with thiserror,  Can't find kernel build files in /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/build
09:15	distanceis	<eath>	what is?
09:15	drumline>		<DE
09:15	distanceis	<eath>	yeah
09:15	distanceis	<eath>	i want it
09:15	distanceis	<eath>	but i have gnome
09:15	distanceis	<eath>	oh well
09:15	Pyru>	how 	<o i install a tar file? lol sorry im very new
09:16	distanceis	<eath>	so do i press the 7.7 gigs?
09:16	apokryphos	< distanceisdeath: very easy to install kde; just sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
09:16	Terminus>		<yru: you don't install it. it's like a zip file.
09:16	Ratzilla>		<yru: use the tar command
09:16	distanceis	<eath>	thats great man
09:16	TheLazy1>		<ello, can someone help me get ubuntu ppc installed on my powerbook g3? all I get is a corrupt screen after running bootx
09:16	apokryphos	< distanceisdeath: 7.7 gigs is more than enough for ubuntu, yup.
09:16	drumline>		<istance: you can use KDE
09:16	distanceis	<eath>	but i need linux on my computer first
09:16	distanceis	<eath>	okay
09:16	drumline>		<istance: Just install all the packages for KDE...  OR download the Kubuntu image.
09:16	Terminus>		<yru: tar xvf should extract it. compression is taken care of by other tools like gzip or bzip2. they use the z and j flag respectively.
09:16	Ratzilla>		<pokryphos: if you use that command, will that install everything that kubuntu has? it wont overwrite gnome will  it?
09:16	distanceis	<eath>	HAHAHA
09:16	distanceis	<eath>	im retarded
09:17	distanceis	<eath>	that is a 7.7 MEGS
09:17	apokryphos	< drumline: the recommended is to install kubuntu-desktop
09:17	distanceis	<eath>	not gigs
09:17	TheLazy1>		<f I select no video driver there is no console text, but the installation screen shows up
09:17	Charredhea	<t>	7.7 megs probably won't be large enough :)
09:17	apokryphos	< Ratzilla: it will install the recommended kubuntu desktop, and won't touch any gnome stuff. They can happily exist together :)
09:17	distanceis	<eath>	okay
09:17	Ratzilla>		<pokryphos: cuz i installed kde..but not kubuntu-desktop..
09:17	distanceis	<eath>	so i have the other 35.7 gbs
09:17	Pyru>	Term	<nus, now it extracted to a folder on my desktop
09:17	Ratzilla>		<pokryphos: thanks :) ill install it
09:17	distanceis	<eath>	what do i do?
09:17	Pyru>	how 	<o i install it, its the latest version of ndiswrapper

09:18	Healot>	al	<eady request for the CD
09:18	Terminus>		<yru: you're gonna have to read the documentation of ndiswrapper.
09:18	chrisx2>	P	<ru, im tryin that, i get an error
09:18	chrisx2>	h	<y can any1 help with thiserror,  Can't find kernel build files in /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/build
09:18	apokryphos	< Ratzilla: it just means you won't get a few of the kubuntu-recommended packages (which includes konversation, amaroK...). You can see the different "routes" for installing kde by visiting wiki.kubuntu.org/InstallingKDE
09:18	kuja>	What	<s the common VNC port that Vino listens on by default?
09:18	distanceis	<eath>	drumline...what do i do?
09:18	chrisx2>	k	<ja, 5900 ??
09:18	kuja>	chri	<x2: Thanks
09:19	apokryphos	< chrisx2: what is it you're trying to do? Looks like you want to install your respective kernel headers
09:19	Terminus>		<hrisx2: maybe you need the kernel headers? just guessing here.
09:19	chrisx2>	o	<ay im tryin to complie ndiswrapper
09:20	Ratzilla>		<pokryphos: thanks very much :)
09:20	apokryphos	< chrisx2: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r), also make sure you've read /msg ubotu ndiswrapper
09:20	GratefulDe	<d>	hello I have a problem to solve in the conversion of files
09:20	Pyru>	i ju	<t downloaded latest ndiswrapper source then untarred it now its on a folder on my desktop , dont know how to install it lol

09:20	chrisx2>	t	< apokryphos
09:20	Corey>	im 	<bout to update to dapper drake is that alright ?
09:20	kuja>	Core	<: I've been using it for a couple months now and I've been happy.
09:20	Terminus>		<yru: if it's like most stuff though, installing it should be something like "./configure; make; sudo make install" you really should read the documentation though.
09:21	apokryphos	< Corey: it should be, yes. The release candidate has just been released.
09:21	Madpilot>		<orey, that depends... but even if it breaks, you get to keep all the pieces ;)
09:21	Charredhea	<t>	?
09:21	distanceis	<eath>	charred with the partitioning?
09:21	Corey>	alr	<ght well im going to upgrade from terminal :)
09:21	distanceis	<eath>	can you help?
09:21	GratefulDe	<d>	I have to convert FAX G3 format to ps or pdf, any suggestion?
09:21	aaaaa>	who	<know what the canonical QA employment is going on?
09:21	apokryphos	< Corey: you can use the update manager to do everything for you, if you like.
09:21	Charredhea	<t>	i didn't partition this hdd when i installed it
09:21	distanceis	<eath>	all right
09:21	Charredhea	<t>	i gave it all 80 gb that it had :-/
09:21	Corey>	um 	<ust reading the tutorial now :)
09:21	apokryphos	< aaaaa: sorry?
09:21	distanceis	<eath>	well can anyone help me with the partitioning?
09:21	apokryphos	< cool
09:21	Corey>	luc	<y i have 22mbit connection :)
09:22	apokryphos	< distanceisdeath: what's the problem?
09:22	apokryphos	< Corey: ni-ice =)
09:22	Charredhea	<t>	I'm sure the instructions aren't hard. do you need to keep any space on there for another OS?
09:22	distanceis	<eath>	i have to partition my 35.7 gigs
09:22	Corey>	yea	< :D
09:22	aaaaa>	Has	<ubuntu got a appropriate QA person?
09:22	GratefulDe	<d>	distanceisdeath, it depends, it's a blank disk and you jave to install another OS?
09:22	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: i have a partition layout here with the same size. you wanna see it? :)
09:22	distanceis	<eath>	no
09:22	K-DawG>	do	<s any1 have a god guide to install Nvidia drivers?
09:22	Madpilot>		<aaaa, they hired someone for QA last month
09:22	distanceis	<eath>	i have windows on there taking up ten gigs
09:22	kuja>	K-Da	<G: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
09:22	distanceis	<eath>	and i wanna save windows
09:22	lotuspsych	<e_>	how do i change grub settings?
09:22	distanceis	<eath>	and give ubuntu ten gigs
09:22	GratefulDe	<d>	distanceisdeath: want to use all the HD for linux then?
09:23	Ratzilla>		<-DawG: the wiki is pretty good , use synaptic
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	nooo
09:23	kuja>	lotu	<psychje: sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	i want windows too
09:23	p00f>	I do	<t understand this  http://tinyurl.com/z5n8x
09:23	lotuspsych	<e_>	kuja tnx!!
09:23	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: well, what i did was i made minimal space for the required mount points and the rest just goes to /home.
09:23	K-DawG>	ku	<a, is that all?
09:23	kuja>	You'	<e welcome
09:23	Corey>	um 	<oes all 5.10 software work on drake ?
09:23	kuja>	K-Da	<G: Pretty much
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	terminus??? what?
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	jsut what did you do
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	im in the middle of the partition wizard
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	and i wanna give it ten gigs
09:23	Ratzilla>		<-DawG: after you install, you gotta type sudo nvidia-glx-config enable ...i think thats it
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	and not affect the windows
09:23	distanceis	<eath>	installation
09:24	distanceis	<eath>	i dont care about my files and music
09:24	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: oh, just 10GB. is the entire hard disk taken up by windows?
09:24	K-DawG>	Ra	<kall, oki il give it a try thanx
09:24	kuja>	Madp	<lot: Turned off by it, I guess :P
09:24	distanceis	<eath>	i believe not
09:24	distanceis	<eath>	it says
09:24	GratefulDe	<d>	distanceisdead: ok then you have the remaining part of the disk blank right?
09:24	Corey>	upd	<tig now wish me luck :)
09:24	distanceis	<eath>	around ten gigs are being used
09:24	Corey>	upd	<ting**
09:24	Corey>	upd	<ting wont wipe any data will it ?
09:25	Madpilot>		<orey, not your own user data, unless something goes badly wrong
09:25	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: ok, and you want ubuntu to take up 10GB too?
09:25	Corey>	ok 	<wseome
09:25	distanceis	<eath>	gratefuldead....its death
09:25	distanceis	<eath>	yes
09:25	Corey>	I w	<sh the servers gave me full speed :(
09:25	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: when you run the installation process you can choose the blank space to be allocated and formatted ext3 or any other journaled fs do you like
09:25	Corey>	im 	<nly downloading at 500 :(
09:25	distanceis	<eath>	and that leaves another five gigs for more windows c***
09:25	Corey>	wha	<s changed in dapper drake ?
09:25	distanceis	<eath>	huh?
09:25	GratefulDe	<d>	distance but you have to allocate something like your RAM*2 for swap
09:25	distanceis	<eath>	what?
09:26	distanceis	<eath>	i just wanna give linux ten gigs
09:26	Ratzilla>		<ou dont NEED swap..but if you want more virtual memory...
09:26	distanceis	<eath>	thats it
09:26	Terminus>		<orey: simplest thing i can think of is 128MB for /boot, 2x your ram for swap, and the rest for /
=== seth is now known as seth|away
09:26	Corey>	Ter	<inus: wrong person buddy :P
09:26	Terminus>		<hoops... distanceisdeath i mean. =D
09:26	Terminus>		<orey: yeah... sorry. hehe
09:26	Corey>	Ter	<inus: whats good about drake ?
09:26	distanceis	<eath>	waht??
09:27	distanceis	<eath>	terminus what did you send me?
09:27	GratefulDe	<d>	Ratzilla: swap is not anymore used?? why you say that?
09:27	distanceis	<eath>	the corey thing?
09:27	Corey>	wha	<s good about dapper drake ?
09:27	Ratzilla>		<ratefulDead: no, it is, but if you install it without swap, it wont complain...you just have less virtual memory
09:28	distanceis	<eath>	if i lose the windows installation can that be fixed!?
09:28	GratefulDe	<d>	Ratzilla: if you run a machine with low RAM it will complain a lot =)
09:28	Madpilot>		<f you've got 1Gb or more, swap really isn't needed. Under that, it's optional but nice to have.
09:28	apokryphos	< Corey: there will likely be an official announcement with a better summary, but: all-round upgraded packages, sync again with debian unstable, new Xorg, new GNOME
09:28	granden>	H	<, dont ubuntu have any cron jobs that run all scripts in /etc/cron.daily cron.monthly etc
09:28	Ratzilla>		<ratefulDead: lol yeah it will i guess, i just meant that you dont need swap..its just a lot better to have it
09:29	Terminus>		<orey: drake?
09:29	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: simplest thing i can think of is 128MB for /boot, 2x your ram for swap, and the rest for /
09:29	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: i can't guide you through which menu item to go to and what to enter coz i don't memorize those stuff.
09:29	distanceis	<eath>	all right
09:29	GratefulDe	<d>	Ratzilla: i always use swap space, even running a machine with 2 gigs RAM, because if you install much RAM it means you need it =)
09:29	distanceis	<eath>	hmmm
09:29	Corey>	wic	<ed
09:29	distanceis	<eath>	if i lose windows can i get it back?
09:29	Terminus>		<orey: sorry. bad lag. :|
09:29	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: you wont lose it if you dont touch its partioton
09:29	distanceis	<eath>	i have to
09:30	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: why?
09:30	distanceis	<eath>	its the only partition for thats available
09:30	distanceis	<eath>	(has enough space)
09:30	apokryphos	< Corey: aha, here http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc
09:30	Terminus>		<orey: lots of stuff. like the preempt kernel, bash-completion works out of the box, etc.
09:30	apokryphos	< ubotu: dapperchanges is at http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc
09:30	ubotu>	oka	<, apokryphos
09:30	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: so as i understood you have all the disk partitoned vfat or ntfs right?
09:30	Corey>	hop	<fully its better than 5.10 cause 5.10 is mad
09:30	apokryphos	< why?
09:30	distanceis	<eath>	i believe so
09:31	Corey>	mad	<cool
09:31	apokryphos	< Terminus: full bash-completion is enabled by default? Hm.
09:31	apokryphos	< Corey: :)
09:31	Ratzilla>		<eah 5.10 is kicking ass for me right now
09:31	distanceis	<eath>	i jsut wanna give linux ten of those free gigs
09:31	Terminus>		<pokryphos: yep. tab completion for command options. =D
09:31	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: then i suggest you to run from windows enviroment something like partition magic to resize the windows partition
09:31	Ratzilla>		<sed it for about a week and i like it more than windows already
09:31	Corey>	yea	<
09:31	Ratzilla>		<istanceisdeath: how much ram do you have?
09:31	Corey>	my 	<th day on linux :D
09:31	distanceis	<eath>	256
09:31	apokryphos	< Terminus: ah, not full bash completion then? As in that in /etc/bash_completion
09:31	distanceis	<eath>	wait
09:32	distanceis	<eath>	i have an idea
09:32	Terminus>		<pokryphos: it's there.
09:32	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: then you will have a free space in the end of your hard disk for installing linux OS
09:32	apokryphos	< Terminus: it's always there, but is it enabled by default?
09:32	apokryphos	< Can't really check anymore
09:32	distanceis	<eath>	i have an extra hd...its master so i cant work a dual hard drive...any way i can just put linux on my useless one and switch back and forth?
09:32	Terminus>		<pokryphos: yep. it was enabled when i installed.
09:32	Ratzilla>		<istanceisdeath: probably best to find out because you'll want to allocate 2xram for swap space.  swap space is used like virtual memory in windows...
09:32	apokryphos	< ok, interesting
09:33	distanceis	<eath>	grateful said to go on the windows os and get a partitioning program and partition off ten gigs
09:33	Corey>	can	< wait until its installed :>
09:33	distanceis	<eath>	is that a good idea?
09:33	Corey>	use	<gparted
09:33	GratefulDe	<d>	anyone can help me? i need to convert FAX g3 files to ps, i can do from ps to FAX g3 thanks to gs but can't do the reverse
09:33	Ratzilla>		<pokryphos: is it possible to go into kde without logging out? or will i have to ctrl alt backspace?
09:34	Madpilot>		<istanceisdeath, you should be able to run two harddrives, regardless of which OSes your running - why is your 2nd HDD "useless"?
09:34	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: if your disk is still all allocated to fat32 or ntfs thats the easiest way
09:34	apokryphos	< Ratzilla: it's a different desktop environment, so for the full experience you'll have to logout, yup. No need to ctrl+alt+backspace though, just select gnome's logout option. Select the different session from the GDM screen, then.
09:34	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: according to other people, better defrag for ntfs partitions -->	http://www.dirms.com/home/homepage.asp
09:35	Ratzilla>		<pokryphos: thanks :)
09:35	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: that should help you when resizing.
09:35	Corey>	!hm	<
09:35	ubotu>	Cor	<y: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
09:35	distanceis	<eath>	madpilot: its a primary from an old computer
09:35	Corey>	gai	< is crap :P
09:35	distanceis	<eath>	it wont fit the slave
09:35	kuja>	Gaim	<is alright.
09:35	Corey>	kop	<te is better
09:35	Terminus>		<orey: crap would be something that doesn't work. :p
09:35	apokryphos	< it's not great for IRC

09:36	distanceis	<eath>	terminus: whats defraging gonna do?
09:36	kuja>	fogo	<: Don't be stupid. Use a better language for GUI development, such as Python or Ruby. PHP is NOT for GUI development.
09:36	Terminus>		<ame here. except for the crash problem between kdesktop and kopete. :(
09:36	Corey>	hav	<nt had that
09:36	Corey>	im 	<sing gnome
09:36	kuja>	Term	<nus: I like that font.
09:36	apokryphos	< Terminus: what crashes?
09:36	Madpilot>		<istanceisdeath, you should be able to change the jumpers and change whether it's a master/slave/etc
09:36	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: compact your filesystem before truncating the partition. you need that if you have to resize.
09:37	distanceis	<eath>	madpilot: dont know how
09:37	Corey>	apa	<ently dreamweaver 8 works in wine on dapper drake :D
09:37	fogos>	kuj	<, i want a crossplataform languague

09:37	Terminus>		<pokryphos: when i right click on a desktop item, kdesktop crashes. the kde people traced it to a problem with kopete.
09:37	Madpilot>		<istanceisdeath, have a look at the drive, most of them have a sticker showing what jumper positions work for which settings - also, google the drive name/id.
09:37	kuja>	fogo	<: PHP is for web development, not GUI development.
09:37	apokryphos	< Terminus: what version of KDE?
09:38	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: not exactly. you have to understand for yourself how filesystems and partitions work.
09:38	distanceis	<eath>	pilot: how do you change it around?
09:38	Terminus>		<pokryphos: 5:45ubuntu1
09:38	Corey>	php	<rawks
09:38	apokryphos	< Terminus: kde-config --prefix?
09:38	kuja>	Core	<: Honestly, it sucks.
09:38	Corey>	kuj	<: what do you program in
09:38	Terminus>		<pokryphos: /usr?
09:38	kuja>	3 ye	<rs of PHP, and I'm proud I don't use it anymore.
09:38	kuja>	Core	<: Ruby.
09:38	distanceis	<eath>	terminus: cant i use a windows partitioning software and make a partition of ten gigs?
09:38	kuja>	Some	<imes Python... :P
09:38	apokryphos	< Terminus: argh, s/prefix/version/, sorry
09:39	Terminus>		<uja: PHP is convenient, but the libs are so messy!
09:39	Corey>	rub	< is crap harhahr
09:39	GratefulDe	<d>	argh, it seems no one can help me :-/
09:39	fogos>	kuj	<, then if develop a program for unix , there is no change for run on windows?
09:39	GratefulDe	<d>	;P
09:39	apokryphos	< distanceisdeath: sure
09:39	Terminus>		<istanceisdeath: well, partitionmagic should probably work. a defrag is always recommend though.
09:39	kuja>	fogo	<: No, no change. Except on Windows you still need the GTK runtime.
09:39	Madpilot>		<istanceisdeath, that depends on the drive - but google ATA jumpers for some howtos
09:39	distanceis	<eath>	partitionmagic sounds exciting
09:39	distanceis	<eath>	okay
09:39	Terminus>		<pokryphos: KDE: 3.5.2 :)
09:39	kuja>	Term	<nus: Messy, yes. Also, the encouraging of bad programming habits displeased me.
09:39	apokryphos	< dapper?
09:40	Corey>	i w	<nder if some os is being developed that owns all os's
09:40	GratefulDe	<d>	distance: its very easy to use, but remember, it's no free software :P

12:01	admir12_pr	<FTW>	and then you can reduce your partition using gparted
12:01	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, there is nothing to save here, i just installed this fresh linux today.

12:03	admir12_pr	<FTW>	Taru: okay

12:03	Waern12>	 	<hmod somethinghereIguess directoryname   ?
12:03	admir12_pr	<FTW>	Taru: to reduce your partition to a 60 gb one and create a 20 GB unallocated block
12:04	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, ok
12:04	Tross12Wha	< is UTB-8? or something like that
12:04	njan>12aer	<er, what are you trying to let users do?
12:04	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, how do i unallocate?
12:04	Termi12s>		<ross: UTF-8 is a character encoding method. it extends ascii i think.
12:05	Waern12>	n	<an: Browse everything, and let them write. I have a directory which shall work as a "dump" on my local network
12:05	Tross12Tem	<nus: Someone told me to "take it away" how i am suppose to do that. And should i?
12:06	njan>12aer	<er, if you want the entire world to be able to write to a directory, you can chmod -r 777 directory, which will give Owner, Group, World all read/wite/execute permission
12:06	admir12_pr	<FTW>	Taru: then install Xp in that partition, after that boot to an install CD
12:06	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, it wont let me make a partition table in the big drive hmm
12:06	Waern12>	n	<an: As long as they're system users?

12:07	phibx12 ac	<andra, firestarter.
12:07	njan>12aer	<er, but you'd be better off doing it by group and adding all the users to a particular group and then doing 'chown -r you:yourgroup directory' and then chmod -r 775 directory, which would make it writable to yourgroup but only readable to anyone not in it
12:07	phibx12 ac	<andra, or, well. i think you have to install it.

12:09	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, i see hdc and sda
12:09	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, thats it
12:10	admir12_pr	<FTW>	Taru: what i suggest you do is just create an installation of Xp (or whatver OS)
12:10	admir12_pr	<FTW>	Taru: then use partition magic to create a 60 Gb partition and install Linux there
12:10	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, ok so boot xp cd
12:10	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, ok cool, will do thanks
12:10	Taru>12dmi	<al_proFTW, be back later
12:10	Termi12s>		<ross: the OS will probably default to C. it wouldn't show funky chars in IRC if you don't have an english keyboard for example.

12:11	Tross12a*	<12:11	admir12_pr	<FTW>	np
12:12	Termi12s>		<ross: maybe you can change it to en_US.UTF-8 instead. you'll lose the swedish chars though. that's probably why the OPs in the other channel told you to remove it, coz the IRC clients can't handle unicode.

03:26	njan>03hri	<x1, I'd look at man route for a brief overview, and look at routing and subnetting if you don't know how that works - wikipedia's probably a good starting place.

03:42	njan>03hri	<x1, which means, for instance, if you have the wlan0 interface setup higher, responses to clients connecting via eth0 will get send back via wlan0, and probably dropped as spoofed traffic by the internet provider for that internet connection.

09:45	ompaul>	ja	<usday, well it should start with x if you want to stop that behaviour I suggest you install "bum" boot up manager and tell it to turn off GDM
09:45	ompaul>	ja	<usday, then you can start it with /etc/init.d/gdm start
09:45	ompaul>	ja	<usday, many ways to skin a cat and that is one of them

10:21	pike__>	pe	<: easiest thing to do might be to 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf' find the line for your graphics card saying driver    "nvidia"  and change that to "vesa".  after that at least you will have a gui and you can work on installing nvidia drivers

01:22	devnu01>	K	<llerKiwi2006, you should be able to get the drivers working with GL and have XGL running even with ATI but it might take a few days to get it setup correctly

01:23	judah01wif	< connection is just like ethernet.. just with now wires.
01:23	devnu01>	K	<iL, i wouldnt image it being much .. but if you are using your graphics card's 3d power you will use more actuall power than 2d

01:23	judah01so 	<he answer is yes.. as long as the card is supported by the install cd.
01:24	KaiL>01eXr	<, ubuntu doesn't have any "netinstall" afaik, but if you mean installing the language-packs, it should work
01:24	bthor01on>	<KillerKiwi2006: Incidently, even though OGL runs great, XGL never did :(

02:46	Linux02nes	< andrejkw, killall esd didn't work ?
02:46	Rando02hCa	<ter>	andrejkw: Doom 3 requires OSS in the kernel
02:47	Rando02hCa	<ter>	if there's isn't an OSS driver, or you're not running ALSA OOS compataiblity, you're OOL
02:47	andre02w>		<an, this is nuts, I am beginning to hate Gnome. I never had problems like this with KDE.
02:47	ompau02 xa	<ice, please don't hit enter after a one word line, and in a terminal you can type apt-cache search game | less and read them all :-)
02:47	andre02w>		< am running everything, I forced the game to use OSS, still no sound.
02:47	dli>	02atl	<n, I think you can "cp -a" for a few boxes, however, if you want really automatic installation, you may read more about the FAI project for debian
02:47	th1>	02dre	<kw, gnome is a bit weird :)

02:48	Rando02hCa	<ter>	hmm :/ if you've got that, I'm not sure then, I doubt Gnome could cause this though
02:48	Jowi>02ndr	<jkw: just a thing... are you running esd? you can try to kill it
02:48	xavic02 I'	< sorry for hitting enter. It's a habit. And thainks.

02:49	xavic02 I 	<gree with adrejkw, KDE comes with TOO much stuff. For example I used to have 3-5 PDF viewers.

09:46	Flannel>	b	<rto-: no, I believe it's not done en masse, but rather by each package maintainer.  This page might give you some pertinant information: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperResources
09:46	monsterb>		<hx
09:47	dli>	Scurv	<yFrog, you have to quit X, and do that
09:47	ScurveyFro	<>	dli: okay
09:47	tuskernini	< matheus, look here: http://gpfreitas.com/tmp/Ekiga-Vono.html
09:47	Quintok>	s	<jepan: sudo apt-get install enlightenment should do it.
09:48	matheus>	t	<skernini, cool....
09:48	stjepan>	Q	<intok, there's no package "enlighement"
09:48	matheus>	t	<skernini, I go to use ekiga now
09:48	Flannel>	s	<jepan: you need to add universe
09:48	tuskernini	< matheus, looks like you should remove a audio codec...
09:48	tuskernini	< my brazilian is not so good... :-)
09:49	matheus>	t	<skernini, ?
09:49	matheus>	t	<skernini, is portuguese
09:49	tuskernini	< matheus, in brazil its brazilian... in portugal its portu... i know..
09:50	matheus>	t	<skernini, the language that we speak
09:50	tuskernini	< i know its the same lang... have lots of port.. freinds
09:50	stjepan>	F	<annel, I did
09:50	Flannel>	s	<jepan: then enlightenment is there
09:50	tuskernini	< matheus, but i also know that it is pronounced way diffirente
09:50	matheus>	t	<skernini, yes... it is
09:51	tuskernini	< non fala portugesh
09:51	tuskernini	< matheus, now go and figure out ekiga... strongs
09:52	Quintok>	s	<jepan: make sure you do an apt-get update
09:52	matheus>	t	<skernini, first I need to install ekiga in my system
09:52	matheus>	t	<skernini, where can I get .deb package ?
09:52	stjepan>	Q	<intok, I did
09:53	ScurveyFro	<>	dli: it told me that the module doesn't exist
09:53	Quintok>	s	<jepan: well I may not be certain it's in the universe but I can see it right here, only other possibility is the multiverse.
09:53	stjepan>	h	<re's my sources list: http://pastebin.com/740786
09:54	dli>	Scurv	<yFrog, that's why, you messed up
09:54	Flannel>	Q	<intok: it's in universe, I just checked.
09:54	matheus>	u	<untu 5.10 is breezy or dapper ?
09:54	Bilford>	b	<
09:54	johannes__	< who has an idea about the macbooks and ubuntu? would that work? i didnt get brighter by looking for that in the web
09:54	ScurveyFro	<>	dli: I'll go through the steps again, but I'm confident I did them right
09:55	Flannel>	O	<.  Dapper.  stjepan, it might be named something differently in dapper.  This is a breezy support channel.   #ubuntu+1 for dapper help.
09:55	dli>	Scurv	<yFrog, okay, you are right
09:55	stjepan>	Q	<intok, if I try to install enlightenment via apt-get, it says nothing. If I try to install it via synaptic, it says: http://pastebin.com/740788
09:55	ScurveyFro	<>	dli: sorry, I didn't mean it like that
09:55	googler>	a	<yone know where to get good documentation about postfix?
09:55	dli>	johan	<es__, I remember macbook has some booting problem, don't know it's solved or not
09:55	ScurveyFro	<>	dli: I'll try again
09:56	KenSentMe>	<googler: postfix.org?
09:56	Flannel>	s	<jepan: erm, and yeah.  It's still "enlightenment" (in universe) on dapper.  So, this should still work.
09:56	stjepan>	F	<annel, but I can't install it :(
09:56	johannes__	< dli with dualboot or with only linux as installation
09:56	googler>	t	<x KenSentMe
09:56	Quintok>	s	<jepan: universe is commented out.
09:56	matheus>	n	<w I must go
09:56	matheus>	g	<od night for all
09:56	dli>	johan	<es__, I mean grub doesn't load with macbook
09:56	KenSentMe>	<googler: you say you are a googler, but you can't use google for this?
09:56	tuskernini	< matheus, i will have alook
09:56	Flannel>	Q	<intok: no, that's universe security.  universe is a few lines up.
09:57	googler>	:	<
09:57	dli>	johan	<es__, but macbook really sucks, if you have to money buy a decent thinkpad :)
09:57	Flannel>	s	<jepan: It's most likely a packaging mistake.  Ask in #ubuntu+1, and file a bug at launchpad.
09:57	Quintok>	f	<annel: lol, good eyes I have
09:57	googler>	i	<didn't find something valued
09:57	stjepan>	Q	<intok, ok, now I uncommented security-universe
09:57	johannes__	< dli i read with the fedora it would work..you may be right its heavy but it looks nice
09:57	Quintok>	s	<jepan: shouldn't make a difference... I'll post my sources.
09:57	stjepan>	b	<w, is it safe to use security universe?
09:57	tuskernini	< get ekiga here http://www.gnomemeeting.org/index.php?rub=5&path=ubuntu/breezy_i386
09:57	dli>	johan	<es__, thinkpad looks better, and it supports linux better
09:58	Flannel>	s	<jepan: why wouldn't it be?

09:59	dli>	johan	<es__, don't touch sony
09:59	dli>	johan	<es__, if you want a japanese one, try fujitsu
09:59	stjepan>	Q	<intok, omg, you're mixing dapper and breezy repositories ?!
09:59	Flannel>	Q	<intok, stjepan, it's a packaging mistake if thats the error you get.  Ask in #ubuntu+1, and check/file at launchpad.
09:59	protocol2>	<is there a way to gets specs of my system via console?
10:00	johannes__	< ok dli but why?did you have one?
10:00	stjepan>	F	<annel, ok,tnx
10:00	dli>	johan	<es__, sony looks good, and that's all, and it's doesn't support linux well

10:00	Quintok>	s	<jepan: that's only for freecontrib

I can get this to work by adding the command 'mythtfrontend -display :0.1' to the startup list. Problem is it seems maybe the overlay doesn't start in time and all I get in myth is a blue screen when I try to watch tv. If I close it and start it manually it's fine.

12:21	Jeeve12Mos	<>	granden: basicly taking 2 HTTP servers (dual NICs), the servers are clustered (2 servers per cluster, NIC1=cluster 1, NIC2=cluster2).  The diddern't NICs are on differen't switches.  The clusters are headless (the servers balance out dynamicly using a token) to take requests.  And the 2 differen't clusters are balanced as well.  That way, if a switch goes down, I still have a running cluster.

02:01	Draco02cus	< arcade: Alright. Here's a question the wiki can't immediately answer: Is NFS fairly quick and simple to set up for somebody experienced with things like Samba?
02:02	ompau02 Ju	<e, you asked how to remove so I took it that you had it stopped ;-)
02:02	Jude>02mpa	<l: Well, it said it had stopped :)
02:02	Jude>02mpa	<l: And there is apparently nothing my-related in init.d. Ack.
02:02	ompau02 Dr	<conicus, did you read the server set up page?

02:02	Draco02cus	< ompaul: I'm reading it now.
02:03	arcad02 Dr	<conicus: Personally I find samba horribly difficult and filled with pitfalls, while NFS is quick'n simple
02:03	ompau02 Ju	<e,  reboot and check it out, get dapper in 5 days and be much happier ;-)
02:03	Draco02cus	< arcade: I can set up samba in three minutes or less. What about NFS?

02:04	Jude>02s d	<pper in five days? I haven't been keeping track.
02:04	arcad02 Dr	<conicus: I can set up NFS in about 20 seconds ("vi /etc/exports ; /etc/init.d/nfs.server start")
02:04	Jude>02 ha	<e every intention of just formatting a spare PC and installing dapper on that, so I guess I'll wait until then :)

02:05	samue02>	w	<at is the latest version of gnome and how do i update ubuntu to it and is it stable
02:05	arcad02 Dr	<conicus: NFS is _very_ simple to set up.  One thing though, you need to have synchronized UIDs for all clients.
02:05	Draco02cus	< arcade: I can't even figure out how to do a line return in that thing. :P
02:05	Draco02cus	< arcade: I know this. That's no problem.
02:06	ompau02 Dr	<conicus, msg me and I will give you a two minute run through in vim that will allow you do a basic edit in it
02:06	arcad02 Dr	<conicus: Then NFS isn't a problem at all.  It's just /mountpoint   IP(accesscontrol) .. on one line in /etc/exports to share that mountpoint to the ip's..
02:07	arcad02 Dr	<conicus: for example: /export/home  192.168.0.*(rw,root_squash,async)
02:07	arcad02 an	< whoopsidoe, you've shared /export/home to the ip's, with read-write access, root is squashed, and 'async' means that the clients don't hang if the nfs-server is rebooted (but they'll get a stale nfs handle)
02:08	ompau02 ar	<ade, whoopsidoe - is that a wiggles reference?
02:08	arcad02 om	<aul: If it was, it got ingrained into my language without me knowing the original reference.

06:22	ompaul>	le	<ur, this (debian style) has one serious difference between it and most other versions of the world, if you install something then we assume you want to run it, so unless it needs lots of TLC to get right it is launched, so turning off dhclient by using system administration networking, you can set a static ip then you can set all the other options

It's up and running again, I didn't do anything... I just let it sleep for a while... might have been exhausted! ;-) Anyway thanks again!

09:23	Hexidigita	<_>	paradizelost:: no... why, is there a new updatE?
09:23	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital_: there will be fairly soon, they seem to have been releasing one every few weeks
09:24	paradizelo	<t>	i know by the end of june that its supposed to be final
09:24	perceptual	<haos>	so I want to install something from source, so I unzipped the source tar into my /usr/src directory and am thinking I should just be able to do configure-make-install from there
09:24	Hexidigita	<_>	paradizelost:: i dont think i have done any updates yet... (can't wait for final)
09:24	perceptual	<haos>	is that correct?
09:24	Hexidigita	<_>	perceptualchaos:: sounds right
09:25	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital_: basically what i usually do, suspend all vm's, then you just run through the install process w/ the new one.
09:25	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital_: don't uninstall the old one, the installer will handle that for you
09:25	Hexidigita	<_>	paradizelost:: sounds easy enough... :)  ubuntu handles the extra weight better than my previous OS
09:26	paradizelo	<t>	Hexidigital_: although i do have to say, that workstation is much nicer for some things.  i purchased a copy back when it was 3.0, and have just got the upgrades, downside, i bought the windows version because that's what i was stuck on all the time.
09:27	perceptual	<haos>	ok now that I have clarified that just to make sure I'm not starting out on the wrong foot, I have installed the wxwidgets development packages from Synaptic and when I run the configure script I still get the following error:

I installed the nvidia-glx drivers and now when I boot the login screen is just blank.  If I ctrl alt backspace the nvidia logo pops up, everything comes back and I'm fine from there but the blank screen is annoying.

The reason I ask is because I setup a naff old laptop for my brother, who has forgotten his password and I stupidly did not add myself to the system as a backup/safegurd.  Last chance is to try john the ripper, but there are no hashes in /etc/passwd.

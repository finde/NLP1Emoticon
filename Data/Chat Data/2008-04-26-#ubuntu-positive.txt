[00:51] <norbi> Hello, just wanted to stop by and say that I am liking Linux/Ubuntu so far.  First time user, everything so far went smooth.  Had problems with mp3/video/embedded web codecs, but nothing a little googling didn't fix.  Awesome community, keep up the good work.  I am pretty sure if problems show up this place will be of much help.  See you all around :)
[00:51] <efrancolaporte> Pelo, yeah i know but you guys are the heroes of linux, if it wasn't for you, 99% would give up, the linux community owes you a lot :)

[01:10] <MattJ> otarid: What was the wifi error you had? (guessing you have one by your smiley face :) )

[01:33] <ubotu> EVERYONE: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[01:38] <gravemind> nice pelo :)

[02:42] <gravemind> fprintf: cool :)
[02:42] <gravemind> mayakuza: if it's not too hard, I can help :)
[02:45] <AlienX> Starnestommy, i don't particularly care :)

[02:48] <AlienX> Wolf23, you type that in :)
[02:49] <nucco> ffm_: both :) higher bandwidth, lower latency is better
[02:51] <osxdude> evilbug- install hardy :)
[02:51] <nucco> ffm_: or use bittorrent and forget about bandwidth issues :)
[02:52] <gravemind> mayakuza: good :)
[02:53] <evilbug> osxdude- i got gutsy to work now :) nevermind.
[02:53] <osxdude> evilbug- good :)
[02:54] <gravemind> mayakuza: sure thing :)

[02:56] <biabia> bazhang: thanks! :)
[03:17] <darkcrab> k thanks. :)
[03:17] <mikebot> ffm_: Ah, but those aren't instantly graitfying! (I mean, thanks.. :) )
[03:22] <nucco> MewRS: you can do that via an argument to mkfs, but that particular drive is hosed :)
[03:23] <MewRS> :)
[03:26] <lee3008> :)
[03:33] <nucco> Pelo: long time since I used a "media library-less" music player... I currently only have rhythmbox :)
[03:42] <Dr_willis> InGunsWeTrust,  Cool. Looks like its 64 bit now as well. :) glad to seeit getting updated
[03:59] <gravemind> thinkingfrog: yeah, but less convenient if you want to change :) it's a trade off
[03:59] <Dr_willis> ToddEDM,  yes. :) what would you do if we all said no?
[04:11] <Paddy_EIRE> bazhang: tried it along time ago... originally the "goodbye microsoft" debian installer.. cannot say I am a fan but I suppose its better than ppl not having it :)
[04:14] <kwame> :)
[04:16] <InGunsWeTrust> bazhang: I have no idea what that means :)
[04:21] <Jordan_U> NetEcho, And intel has always provided open source drivers and documentation :)

[04:34] <m2geek> Hello Room :)
[04:36] <m2geek> tuchki nope, i have a 9600 pro that works :)
[04:39] <TropicalDude> bazhang: how :)? from synaptic?
[04:46] <seamus7> darkcrab: then logic would dictate you did something which led to its installation .... that you can't remember what that is is beside the point :)
[04:46] <josh04> bagelong: "sudo ndiswrapper -m", then reboot and see if it works :)
[04:48] <darkcrab> :) yea, thats why I finally decided to ditch windows, was hoping to leave the security problems behind.
[04:49] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, If you were being hacked they probably wouldn't change anything noticeable, this is a great answer because it both alleviates your fear that this is a sign of being hacked and makes you more paranoid at the same time :)
[05:01] <neil_d> jsoftw: Karshin: you can also 'sudo su -' :)
[05:01] <binarybandit> happy saturday :)
[05:01] <jsoftw> neil_d: true :)

[05:09] <jsoftw> almost finished upgrading to 8 :)
[05:13] <jamiejackson> neil_d: "more detail" meaning you need more from me, or you're about to provide more detail? :)
[05:32] <B166erx> Nikonlappy, make it long then :) i'm at it for 6 hours now..still no answers .
[05:37] <nhuyanhuk> thanks mate :)
[06:15] <howlingmadhowie> mepatuhoo: i'd be surprised if you could combine struts and php :)
[06:16] <Kyle__> dpt: probably not the console client, it might not do it :)
[06:22]  * nickrud thinks Vlet has good advice, but someone's gotta test it :)
[06:28] <f00f-> ok i'll try to reboot in textmode :)
[06:29] <nickrud> milly1234 heh. I hope to see few, that means it's a clean release :)
[06:34] <nickrud> green get a different irc client, you are bright red when you use my nick in xchat :)

[08:59] <joe_> :)
[09:02] <arvind_khadri> cute_bettong, you need the cd way then :)
[09:04] <arvind_khadri> IndyGunFreak, aah sorry thought you wanted to know about it ,am not following here much :)
[09:06] <Dr_willis> IndyGunFreak,  perhaps NOW the  thing will get bugs and security issues fixed. :)
[09:07] <Dr_willis> toplok,  lots of us are. :)
[09:07] <arvind_khadri> nick_, well ubuntu uses gnome :)
[09:08] <Dr_willis> joe_,  nope. thats not it. :) i did need that tool for somthing.. but thats not the nvidia-xconfig tool
[09:09] <Dr_willis> joe_,  i use both of those. :)
[09:11] <newscane> so how do i fix it? :)
[09:14] <toplok> ferris_, yep, I use five different OS here :)
[09:17] <Dr_willis> hangthedj,  it just started working. :) its working now for me here..
[09:19] <Dr_willis> nick_,  you will have to try it and decide for yourself I guess. :)
[09:26] <Dr_willis> GT,  most likely its a videocard/driver/monitor issue. :) depends on the details.
[09:29] <rob> :)
[09:30] <androver> earthcreed: they switched to pulseaudio in 8.04.  Wine, at least, doesn't have a pulseaudio driver working yet so they do some compatibility stuff with OSS.  Not that that helps :)
[09:30] <androver> razel: you might be able to, but i'm gonna sleep soon :)
[09:33] <bigtimer121> thanks for the help :)

[21:43] <Jordan_U> Some_Person, You should file a bug and in the mean time you can install Firefox2 ( or if you want something fast new and interesting try epiphany-webkit though you will have to compile it yourself :)
[21:47] <CJS3141> bagelong: No problem--hope you get it working sometime soon. :)
[21:49] <loosid> TimMatrix2: Good enough :)
[21:51] <loosid> :)
[22:00] <loosid> TimMatrix2: pastebin.com   --  You missed the E :)
[22:02] <Jordan_U> jon__, That's really not much of a threat ( at least for those of us who aren't complete fanatics :)
[22:05] <MrObvious> :)
[22:09] <loosid> tomd123: unless you have Comcast :)
[22:10] <tomd123> loosid: I found out the hard way :)
[22:10] <loosid> TimMatrix2: Sounds good to me.  I've done the same and had good results :)
[22:12] <MrObvious> Assid: I'm downlodaing IEs4Linux :).
[22:19] <shane2peru> Steven1, Windows is not grub friendly. :)
[22:24] <tomd123> flyback: ya, I guess you have a point to move to a different distro then, but I would surely miss the simplicity :)
[22:36] <alabamahit> Cool thanks Everyone :)
[22:39] <Jordan_U> pr4bh,  I can try :)
[22:39] <shane2peru> Steven1, ok, I'll be back in a bit, reboot, and you should be back too. :)
[22:39] <alabamahit> nickrud: Thanks :)
[22:47] <Bidget> Jordan_U, I got it to work, I just opened synaptic and closed it, and then did the update manager. Appears to be working now :)

[23:18] <CJS3141> amazen720: That's understandable! :) But to get more clues as possible, try as many other CDs as you can to see if it is just a problem with the Vista written disk.
[23:18] <william__> Y-Town: i like and use them both :)
[23:21] <qbert> unop: im on ubuntu :)
[23:21] <unop> qbert, CJS3141 never mind me, i didn't read the question right :)

[23:26] <CJS3141> InfernoX222: Just ask your question, and wait patiently to see if someone can answer it :)
[23:28] <Bidget> Jordan_U, alright I got it, I'll give the update another try and we'll see what happens this time :)
[23:39] <Jordan_U> terrestre, Doesn't live up to its name? :)
[23:42] <djlenoir> ferris, Ubuntu is loading now. Hopefully this will clear up the GRUB error 22 when booting. :)
[23:42] <Jordan_U> Kasio, No, you should just end up with gnome with an ugly theme and none of the session startup programs started :)
[23:44] <CJS3141> aphan9: You've got to be more specific--give more details. :)
[23:45] <androver> Byan: what do you mean "maybe"? :)
[23:45] <Jordan_U> ferris_, If nothing else there is one in bsdgames, but it's an old text based one :)
[23:51] <Marshal> don't ask me i'm just browsing this channel :)
[23:58] <tomtommy> Platyhelminth, listen carefully to what I am about to say :)   You should try a fresh and toally new install using ALTERNATIVE install

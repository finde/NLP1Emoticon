12:00	<cached>	seveas: finish it today and have cron script edit the page linking to it
12:00	<livevil>	airblue, I've tryed to follow the instrunction written in the web page you have indicated, but the file sources.list is different
12:00	<Seveas>	czambran, no
12:00	<todayisagift>	keherman: i d/l audacious the winamp-like media player, i extracted it to the tmp folder and now i forgot what to do
12:00	<Mewshi>	it says it couldn't find "libxine-extracodecs" is there something i need to add to the repositories?
12:00	<pitti_>	kermitX_: aptitude automatically removes dependencies it installed automatically

12:00	<keherman>	todayisagift, go into the directoy
12:01	<czambran>	Seveas, will new updates come out once it gets released?
12:01	<cached>	yes
12:01	<Spec>	Mewshi: enable the multiverse
12:01	<cached>	i can answer that one :)
12:01	<Mewshi>	how do i do that?
12:01	<todayisagift>	keherman: ok
12:01	<cached>	edit the file
12:01	<cached>	wtf
12:01	<Spec>	!multiverse
12:01	<pitti_>	kermitX_, if you aptitude install foo, this pulls in bar, then aptitude remove foo will also remove bar, since you didn't explicitly want it
12:01	<ubotu>	To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource

12:01	<Spec>	Mewshi: ^^
12:01	<keherman>	todayisagift, whats in there?
12:01	<pitti_>	kermitX_, that's a great feature to keep your system clean

12:02	<Spec>	cached: your monitor hates you
12:02	<cached>	it wants me to get cancer
12:02	<Seveas>	kermitX_, the installer uses aptitude 
12:02	<Spec>	you can fix it, you know

12:02	<zelevw>	hi...im trying to use an ssh tunnel for vnc and I type:  ssh -L 5901:remotehost:5901 remotehost , once connected I try to vncviewer localhost:1 and I get this error: ReadFromRFBServer: rdr::EndOfStream What am I doing wrong? Thanks.
12:02	<pitti_>	kermitX_, usually, the installer manually installs all *-desktop dependencies to prevent that; if xubuntu doesn't do that, then you should indeed file a bug
12:02	<pitti_>	crimsun?
12:03	<crimsun>	pitti_: a friendly hug.

12:20	<ekelund>	keherman: thanx maybe will try it someday. what time is the release says less than 24h
12:20	<ucordes>	that's the big question
12:20	<Spec>	UTC
12:20	<czambran>	ucordes, UTC!
12:20	<Spec>	!UTC
12:20	<ubotu>	Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Spec
12:20	<ucordes>	ok, i see
12:21	<Polypterus>	GMT 00:00 is what I've heard
12:21	<keherman>	would people pay like $10 for up to 15 minutes of Uubuntu support?
12:21	<sybariten>	i just cant understand why people want to know if its released in 14 or 18 hours? Do they have clients that are terrible dependent on this specific release or "what-the-fuss?"
12:21	<odjay>	keherman - well basically when I boot my livecd I use the persistent flag and the boot faile with an error at /dev/sde drive or something
12:21	<Spec>	damn, maybe i was hit by a windmill
12:21	<nbx909>	Seveas, will it be a sane hour? edt
12:21	<Spec>	10$ for 15 minutes?
12:21	<nbx909>	lol
12:21	<Spec>	that's pretty steep
12:21	<Rdde>	noone? =(
12:21	<ucordes>	sybariten my client really depends on
12:21	<keherman>	Spec, $5 ?
12:21	<czambran>	sybariten, that we are all looking forward to see how the final release behaves
12:21	<Doso>	sybariten: Well basicly I got nothing else to do and i want to use daper drake to do my final Windows ->	Linux switch ~~
12:21	<odjay>	keherman - otherwise without peristent flag (to save session on usb pen) my dapper work very well
12:21	<ucordes>	im my own client
12:21	<ucordes>	^^
12:21	<Seveas>	ok people, cut the dapper release talk. It will NOT be released in 40 minutes so please stop the speculation
12:21	<Polypterus>	Thought this channel had to be packed and active now :)
12:21	<keherman>	Rdde, what program?
12:21	<gnomefreak>	if your that hard up for dapper get the daily image and do the 1 update that it has poof your than on stable

12:22	<eric>	Seveas when WILL it be released??
12:22	<Rdde>	keherman, trying to install a program called kismet.. unpacked it and there is a install-sh but I dont know what to do now
12:22	<sybariten>	ok so appearently people rely on this release to be some sort of messias of the operating systems
12:22	<Seveas>	ajmitch_, that and a handful of quick-fire aliases
12:22	<gnomefreak>	eric: dont
12:22	<kspath_>	eric: Before June 2nd.
12:22	<sleepe1>	hi ppl! i need help!   how can i downgrade nvidia-glx ?
12:22	<czambran>	eric,  he already said sometime June 1st.
12:22	<ajmitch_>	eric: don't bother asking, please
12:22	<keherman>	Rdde, why dont you install it from APT instead?
12:23	<keherman>	Rdde, $ aptitude install kismet
12:23	<eric>	OK OK
12:23	<ucordes>	gnomefreak, so it's no big difference to the last image?

12:24	<visik7>	Seveas: have you removed java from your dapper repo ?
12:24	<kspath_>	gnomefreak: I agree but it is something perhaps.
12:24	<Seveas>	visik7, no
12:24	<czambran>	gnomefreak, if somebody asks, then u can quickly tell them
12:24	<czambran>	read the title

12:25	<sleepe1>	anybody?
12:25	<s|k>	er
12:25	<Seveas>	visik7, it's replaced with dummy packages depending on the ones in the Ubuntu archives
12:25	<nbx909>	seveas it's only 22:24 zulu lol
12:25	<visik7>	Seveas: is there some reason or what ?
12:25	<visik7>	Seveas: oh ok
12:25	<s|k>	what's the irc channel for the forums?
12:25	<visik7>	:)
12:25	<sybariten>	keherman: hmm
12:25	<keherman>	sybariten, meant to make the platforms similar in defined ways so that software can be compatible across multiple distrivutions
12:25	<Seveas>	nbx909, yes 90 minutes more of "is it going to be at 0:00" crap
12:25	<gnomefreak>	s|k: #ubuntu-forums i think   maybe without the -
12:25	<kspath_>	!tell s|k about forum
12:25	<keherman>	are we there yet?
12:25	<tarvid>	which package displays the contents of gnu dbm files
12:26	<HellDragon>	1337 is the language of the future
12:26	<s|k>	kspath_: it doesn't have the channel name
12:26	<kspath_>	HellDragon: of unemployement?
12:26	<yct>	am I the only one waiting for Drake here?:)
12:26	<Sharjeel>	lol

12:26	<Sharjeel>	0001-0011-0011-0111
12:26	<kspath_>	yct: Dapper will be released before June 2nd.
12:26	<ucordes>	wtf is 1317?
12:26	<s|k>	kspath_: they deleted all my dapper posts today, and I think everyone elses
12:26	<Sharjeel>	is the language of future;)
12:26	<ucordes>	1337 ^^
12:27	<Seveas>	s|k, wtf
12:27	<livevil>	DO you need something more for internet security over firestarter
12:27	<kspath_>	s|k: "they" a conspiracy?
12:27	<gnomefreak>	ucordes: crap is what it is IMHO
12:27	<Seveas>	forums really are ruled by crappy idiots I guess
12:27	<livevil>	do you think I need something else for internet security, over firestarter?
12:27	<sybariten>	keherman: ok ... i have appearently changed mine since installing ubuntu, and now when upgrading versions, there is a "newer" version or something and apt asks me if i want to upgrade the file or not
12:27	<czambran>	Seveas, why do you say that?
12:27	<kspath_>	livevil: clue is good for security,
12:27	<gnomefreak>	if you write code to have a number/name and not do it for yourself or to help others its not worth a crap
12:27	<Seveas>	czambran, deleting posts is SO not done
12:28	<[zero] >	Anyone know why when I boot up ubuntu it just restarts?
12:28	<czambran>	Seveas, ohh that, my bad
12:28	<ucordes>	nikomedia was captured by sultan orhan in 1st in 1337
12:28	<livevil>	wht's clue kspath_?
12:28	<odjay>	sorry to ask but dapper 6.06 that I current run is what ? what is going to be released very soon the final ... the one I got is a rc2
12:28	<BSDinux>	how can i temporarily deactivate gnome? i want to start X11 without gnome, but i can't find the /etc/rc.conf on my ubuntu box...
12:28	<gnomefreak>	odjay: june 1st
12:28	<yct>	kspath_, I know there's hours to release, but this is the place to be at:)
12:28	<ucordes>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC!
12:28	<kspath_>	livevil: I think there will be some information on securing ubuntu at ubuntu sites. General linux security howtos are everywhere.
12:28	<ucordes>	lol
12:28	<RandolphCarter>	gah, 0.00 BST? :D
12:28	<hollywoodb>	odjay: if you stay current with apt-get or synaptic you'll basically be running the same thing as dapper stable
12:29	<Mysta_>	i think i've tried to run apt-get / aptitude too many times. now it says theres a lock. how do i remove this LOCK???
12:29	<Seveas>	Mysta_, the safest way is to reboot
12:29	<Sharjeel>	1111-0000-1100    0001-0011-0011-0111
12:29	<yct>	kspath_, I could install RC and update, but this is the event; i'm happy
12:29	<Sharjeel>	:)
12:29	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: i didnt they there was a number of times
12:29	<Seveas>	Sharjeel, stop it
12:29	<kspath_>	livevil: firestarter is only a firewall and only the tip of basic security. a firewall can not prevent problems by itself.
12:29	<Sharjeel>	soz
12:29	<czambran>	I didn't even know, you could get lock out
12:29	<aleksand1r>	anyone knows the difference between 'sudo update-manager -d' from the console and 'gksudo update-manager -d'? the latter doesn't show the option to upgrade to dapper - strange
12:29	<livevil>	ok, sorry for the stupid question
12:29	<darich>	the Dapper update broke my networking...and borked my fglrx driver
12:29	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: im not sure i understand your last comment
12:29	<Sharjeel>	dint mean to be rude seveas but i doent likel337 lingo:D
12:29	<darich>	but I fixed it
12:29	<Seveas>	aleksand1r, gksudo "update-manager -d

12:30	<erus`>	i cant get radeon 9800 pro 3d to work on ubuntu
12:30	<erus`>	please help
12:30	<kspath_>	livevil: Not really a stupid question. It is something you can answer for yourself by doing research.
12:30	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: i didnt know there was a lock when you used apt-get or aptitude too many times
12:30	<ucordes>	darich: i also broke my system with the update
12:30	<_clem>	hey !! Dapper was released. There's a leak on one of the Czech mirrors !!
12:30	<aleksand1r>	thanks @seveas
12:30	<Rdde>	keherman, have you ever used the program ? kismet?
12:30	<Sharjeel>	hey does ubuntu come with the nvidia driver or will i have to install it?
12:30	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: sorry, i assumed that.
12:30	<_clem>	ahh.. na.. I was only kidding :)
12:30	<ucordes>	clem? lol
12:30	<blah>	how do i remove a user in terminal
12:30	<keherman>	erus`, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
12:30	<czambran>	_clem, I wouldn't trust it
12:30	<hollywoodb>	Mysta_: gnomefreak: there's a lock when either synaptic, aptitude, or apt-get processes are currently running
12:30	<erus`>	followed that but still no worky
12:30	<Seveas>	blah, sudo deluser $USERNAME
12:30	<keherman>	Rdde, i was at H2K2 when it was released!
12:31	<BSDinux>	can someone enlightenme on where the X11 autostart happens in ubuntu? i want to deactivate gnome temporarily and automatically run a program when X11 starts
12:31	<Mysta_>	hollywoodb: what is the name of the process?
12:31	<gnomefreak>	hollywoodb: yes but we werent talking about that
12:31	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: apt
12:31	<Mysta_>	thx
12:31	<Rdde>	keherman, what dose that mean? =P
12:31	<aleksand1r>	checked it - works with brackets
12:31	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: if synaptic is open apt wont run because it uses apt
12:31	<keherman>	Rdde, it means I've used it for a very long time :-)
12:31	<keherman>	Rdde, H2K2 is a 'hacker' conference
12:31	<darich>	really ucordes
12:31	<hollywoodb>	gnomefreak: I'm aware, but if it could be a hanging process from one of the many times it was run, causing the lock to remain in place
12:31	<your_mom>	whats the apt-get to install xorg again
12:31	<gnomefreak>	hollywoodb: true
12:31	<your_mom>	i messed up x
12:32	<mutante>	Rdde: if you | the output of kismet to "festival" ,you can put on headphones and close the laptop while walking around and be notified of new networks
12:32	<your_mom>	and cant load to gnome
12:32	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: im using no X, straight console
12:32	<aleksand1r>	is 1,8 GB free space on my / enough to upgrade to dapper?
12:32	<keherman>	mutante, i love festival!
12:32	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: ok than check on ps aux
12:32	<keherman>	aleksand1r, yep
12:32	<keherman>	aleksand1r, many files will be overwritten
12:32	<_clem>	it happened for FC5 though, and as I remember there were leaks on SUSE10.1 as well. People became to go crazy just before the release. Fedora had given a precise time 2pm GMT it was crazy on some forums :)
12:32	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: do you have gui running on another tty?
12:32	<lmh>	hi all, have trouble getting my wlan adapter to work (centrino)
12:32	<BSDinux>	can someone enlightenme on where the X11 autostart happens in ubuntu? i want to deactivate gnome temporarily and automatically run a program when X11 starts

12:33	<luis_>	will dapper REALLY be released in an hour? (according to 'the fridge')
12:33	<p_mash>	is there an utility wiht ububtu to monitor network traffic ? ie the bandwidth etc ...
12:33	<gnomefreak>	luis_: no
12:33	<Seveas>	luis_, /topic
12:33	<Fillado>	dammit i can't decided between KDE of Gnome for Dapper :(
12:33	<czambran>	luis_, read the title of the forum
12:33	<yct>	i dont like FC for not supporting ReiserFS
12:33	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: haven't figured out how to do that yet. i ran ps aux, whats the diff between that and top?
12:33	<Beginer>	I have some problems with Live CD booting so I have one stupid question to ask.When I download Ubuntu should I unpack rar archive and than burn it on a CD or not?
12:33	<Rdde>	keherman, heavy! well it wont start.. can i post the message to you in private?
12:33	<kspath_>	luis_: Dapper will be released before June 2nd.
12:33	<hollywoodb>	Fillado: xubuntu !
12:33	<SurfnKid>	!fn
12:33	<ubotu>	Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, SurfnKid
12:33	<Fastly>	i added the apt source: deb http://kubuntu.org/packages/amarok-14 dapper main so that i can upgrade amarok to 1.4... now it doesn't autodetect my ipod..:
12:33	<lmh>	can't send a ping over wlan although it tells me i'm connected
12:33	<Fastly>	No new media devices were found. If you feel this is an error, ensure that the DBUS and HAL daemons are running and KDE was built with support for them. You can test this by running "dcop kded mediamanager fullList" in a Konsole window.
12:33	<ruskie_>	Beginer: burn it as a iso
12:33	<aleksand1r>	luis_ , even less
12:33	<Mysta_>	Beginer: download the ISO, and then burn it
12:33	<keherman>	Rdde, k
12:33	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: top gives you more info and it changes alot more
12:33	<_clem>	yct: yeah.. they kind of officially chose ext3...
12:33	<lmh>	anyone an idea?
12:33	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: ok
12:33	<bkanuka>	my usb cdrom will ot work
12:33	<luis_>	ok, thanks everyone
12:34	<Fillado>	hollywoodb: xubuntu? :D
12:34	<hollywoodb>	Mysta_: if you like top you'll love htop
12:34	<_clem>	lmh: then it's lying !!! :(
12:34	<bkanuka>	ive been trying ffor days
12:34	<Fastly>	what's the best way of adding dbus and hal from the dapper kubuntu sources?
12:34	<aleksand1r>	26 min. to dapper release ;)
12:34	<hollywoodb>	Filbert: Xfce instead of KDE or Gnome
12:34	<weierstrass>	hi there. i have a problem. when i installed ubuntu i forgot to make a swap partition. the system boots and everything, but what's the easiest way to repartition and fix this?
12:34	<yct>	_clem, I've seen benchmarks and stuff, but in my own experience i can't stand anything else than reiser.. didn't tried xfs though
12:34	<MTecknology>	Installed Dapper and restored my firefox profile. I restored it from a Windows profile and it actually worked. Only problem is that when I try to play a flash game, it gets stuck in a loop and eventually closes ff, when I try to use a java applet, it just closes ff while loading. - i doubt this is dapper specific
12:34	<Seveas>	aleksand1r, last warning.
12:34	<SurfnKid>	does anyone knowh ow to create a FN KEY for a specific command
12:34	<Fillado>	ah
12:34	<czambran>	aleksand1r, read the title
12:34	<kspath_>	aleksand1r: Dapper will be released before June 2nd.
12:34	<lmh>	ifconfig tells me it's up and connected, already has an address, but still i can't ping /surf

12:34	<Seveas>	next one to ask when dapper will be released gets larted
12:34	<lmh>	destination host unreachable
12:35	<kspath_>	Mysta_: apt-get install htop
12:35	<hollywoodb>	Mysta_: yeah, you'll have to install it once apt is working
12:35	<_clem>	yct: I like reiserfs myself, even though I don't really know why :) I used to be a slackware fan, and Patrick loved Reiserfs... I guess I got that from him.. I don't know much about FS though.
12:35	<Mysta_>	lol ok
12:35	<Beginer>	I have downoladed it and its archive that can be opend with winrar.

12:35	<czambran>	Doso, :-D
12:35	<Mysta_>	hollywoodb: ok, so i found the process. is it just kill PID, replacing PID w/ the commands PID

12:39	<sybariten>	hm, this process that apt does after downloading the very dist-upgrade ... i mean, after downloading the hundreds of megabytes....  does it take a long time? should i be prepared for an hour of HD-chewing, or is it like ten minutes ?
12:39	<Seveas>	sybariten, closer to an hour than to ten minutes
12:39	<Beginer>	When I download Ubuntu shoul I only burn that one file or should I extract it and than burn it?
12:39	<bkanuka>	Aven: what version outlook?
12:39	<Seveas>	depending on how many packages you installed
12:39	<Aven>	bkanuka: newest :P
12:39	<keherman>	Rdde,my user name is not registered here
12:39	<Mysta_>	Beginer: just burn the ISO to disk

12:42	<rob_p>	BSDinux: 'sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove' should do it.

12:42	<H080J03>	i know the command line for takeing a screen shot, but i just need to set the configure the keyboard short cuts to do that command
12:43	<keherman>	Rdde, this is my default id at school
12:43	<tarzeau>	sybariten: i disagree
12:43	<yct>	_clem, what would be the overall opinion on suse? i tried it in past (3-4 yrs back), was pretty impressive
12:43	<keherman>	Rdde, so i cant priv msg you sorry
12:43	<gnomefreak>	Seveas: in #ubuntu+1?
12:43	<aleksand1r>	BSDinux: you mean remove gdm?
12:43	<djib>	hey
12:43	<djib>	I'm trying to update to dapper but when I do a dist-upgrade apt want to get rid of loads of packages like eclipse, amarok, ...
12:43	<Seveas>	gnomefreak, just did it there 
12:43	<sybariten>	tarzeau: yeah but you arent dist-upgrading
12:43	<RandolphCarter>	lmh: they're both connected to the same network though? you'll need to setup the routing table
12:43	<gnomefreak>	ah
12:43	<djib>	why, and how can I avoid that ?
12:43	<tarzeau>	sybariten: yes i do sometimes
12:43	<BSDinux>	i only want to stop gdm/gnome from starting when x starts.. and i want to add another programm instead (no daemon)
12:43	<sybariten>	Seveas: what the kufc was with that smiley???!
12:43	<Rdde>	keherman,  did you get my msg? someghing about package source? is that the network card? =S
12:43	<BSDinux>	i'll try the rc-remove thing
12:44	<BSDinux>	and add the prog in xsessions.d
12:44	<tarzeau>	sybariten: why does it matter if you do it in a gnu screen?
12:44	<bkanuka>	has anyone seen this with usb device!? " device descriptor read/64, error -110"
12:44	<keherman>	Rdde, i sent you many message in here
12:44	<ompaul>	Seveas, that might not be tje best idea

12:44	<lmh>	RandolphCarter: yes, they're both connected to the same net. what i'd like to do is being able to use the "places"-function under gnome-network - settings: switch between home-lan / home-wlan
12:44	<Seveas>	iverylm, /topic
12:44	<keherman>	Rdde, http://kerneltrap.org/node/5414

12:45	<djib>	can someone tell me why dist-upgrade wants to get rid of all those packages and how I can avoid that ?
12:45	<Mysta_>	wow, htop ROX!
12:45	<ompaul>	for +1 I think it safe to  kill them that will be closed ..
12:45	<gnomefreak>	djib: all what packages?
12:45	<Mysta_>	lol, im a noob
12:45	<aleksand1r>	but i guess you can't be a newbie to attempt it
12:45	<kspath_>	Mysta_: apt-cache search rox
12:45	<RandolphCarter>	lmh: that should be relatively easy, just don't have both interfaces up at the same time
12:45	<BSDinux>	i'll try that now, thanks
12:45	<_clem>	yct: I loved it myself, I reviewed it here : http://www.linuxforums.org/reviews/review_of_suse_10.1.html It's more like an overview though... I didn't go in the innards of things. I got criticized a lot for that, and a lot of people seem enclined to say that SUSE and Fedora are shit because they see it as the new "linux standards".. the whole anti-windows crap and all..
=== Spec is now known as Spec[x] 
12:45	<RandolphCarter>	lmh: for home-lan disable eth1, and from home-wan disable eth0
12:46	<Mysta_>	kspath_: what was that?
12:46	<keherman>	RandolphCarter, is that you Doug?
12:46	<kspath_>	Mysta_:  something interesting
12:46	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell _clem -about language
12:46	<RandolphCarter>	keherman: nope :/
12:46	<keherman>	nm, lol
12:46	<Rdde>	keherman, thanks mate
12:46	<djib>	gnomefreak: I want to dist-upgrade from breezy to dapper. I updated my source.list and when I do a dist upgrade, it tells me that 253 packages will be removes, including some like Eclipse that I use all the time
12:46	<bkanuka>	please i have no cd rom and need it tonight
12:46	<_clem>	ah come on....
12:46	<RandolphCarter>	:P
12:46	<_clem>	ok sorry..
12:46	<keherman>	Rdde, no problem
12:46	<SurfnKid>	slapping around rules
12:47	<h3h_timo>	does anyone know why my ram wouldnt be compatible... it is the same type of ram that i have now.. it just wont boot with my computer
12:47	<lmh>	RandolphCarter: thanks, tried that b4, didn't work, now it miracolusly works. Great, Thanks!
12:47	<keherman>	h3h_timo, bad slot?
12:47	<g0dchild>	hid3, all, I have a lotta stuff downloaded and as expectd, the /var partition is now full
12:47	<bkanuka>	my dmesg says " device descriptor read/64, error -110" I dont know what else is wrong
12:47	<keherman>	h3h_timo, you busted it jamming it in!??!
12:47	<RandolphCarter>	lmh: np's :)
12:47	<g0dchild>	is it possible to have apt-get to look up from a local server/aka a folder on another partition of the same PC?
12:47	<h3h_timo>	no... its the same exact kind... i didnt bust it either
12:47	<charle97>	hello
12:47	<_clem>	yct: rug is great as well (the package manager). It's still very slow compared to APT though.
12:48	<h3h_timo>	i tried both sticks in both scots
12:48	<bkanuka>	hello
12:48	<amphi>	hello
12:48	<_clem>	yct: I think Fedora and Suse should really look at Ubuntu and learn from the APT advantages.
12:48	<eXistenZ_>	we need ubuntu 6 =|
12:48	<_clem>	yct: also, it wouldn't harm Ubuntu to look at what's done in FC and SUSE as regards to integration and look and feel.
12:49	<LinuxJones>	g0dchild, apt-get clean
12:49	<djib>	gnomefreak: any idea ?
12:49	<charle97>	what would be the best way to download 6.06 when released?
12:49	<kspath_>	eXistenZ_: dapper will be released before June 2nd.
12:49	<_clem>	yct: and finally... enough of these customized kernels ... they annoy so many people who don't care about the features they offer...
12:49	<gnomefreak>	djib: if you look in the installing new packages you should see them
12:50	<g0dchild>	LinuxJones, no- thats not it, i dont want to lose any one of those downloaded packages- short of bandwidth...but i'd like apt-get to look up from a local repo- if thats posible
12:50	<gnomefreak>	djib: alot of name changes have happened in dapper
12:50	<djib>	gnomefreak: ok, I'll have a look
12:50	<h3h_timo>	!tell
12:50	<_clem>	charle97: I suppose there'll be a torrent link. Otherwise you can rely on the FTP mirrors.
12:50	<hyphenated>	charle97: bittorrent, would be the nicest way for everyone, but it'll use more bandwidth overall. alternatively, downloading from a mirror that is within your country or close to it
12:50	<SurfnKid>	someone pleaaase help me set up FN keys
12:50	<charle97>	_clem and hyphenated, ty
12:50	<LinuxJones>	g0dchild, you mean like one closer to where you live ?

12:51	<g0dchild>	LinuxJones, no...i really dont know how to explain it- ok, have it this way- i need to know how i can serve packages off http- on localhost
12:51	<sugyi>	the best way to download dapper is to use torrents, cos this way u leave the servers space for living, cos many people is going to download dapper
12:51	<kspath_>	jhenn: apt-cache search palm
12:51	<amphi>	SurfnKid: what do you mean?

01:05	<pericles>	gnomefreak: why wrong?
01:05	<aleksand1r>	than you'll need to edit the /etc/fstab and add the swap line
01:05	<gnomefreak>	pericles: because it wont be released in 57 minutes
01:05	<Knorrie>	Hisakasex: www.postfix.org has very good documentation
01:05	<exhale>	gnomefreak, how come?
01:05	<Hisakasex>	ok
01:05	<pericles>	gnomefreak: but they say so...

01:05	<gnomefreak>	Seveas: you care to explain this?
01:05	<via_strass>	thanx aleksand1r am i right in thinking that a swap partition doesn't need formatting?
01:06	<roostishaw>	how do I get my menu to look like this: http://tinyurl.com/e7h6e

01:06	<aleksand1r>	there will be an option in the partitioning tool
01:06	<atzar>	does dapper work with ibook airport extreme if i install dapper on my brother's computer ?
01:06	<gnomefreak>	dapper will be released when it hits the servers noone knows when that will be because there is no telling how long it takes to upload or when it is being uploaded
01:07	<aleksand1r>	1 resize 2 create partition
01:07	<_clem>	via_strass : well it needs formatting the first time I guess...
01:07	<_clem>	via_strass : actually... I don't have a clue :) !!
01:07	<tanek>	rubso: nope, i havent... care to explain? :P
01:07	<aleksand1r>	via_strass: creating partition will need choosing a type of it
01:07	<aleksand1r>	via_strass: choose swap
01:08	<Flannel>	atzar: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuOnMac
01:08	<via_strass>	hmm i have a copy of paragon partition manager. iirc my livecd of hoary doesn't boot, it just hangs when starting X..

If you feel this is an error, ensure that the DBUS and HAL daemons are running and KDE was built with support for them. You can test this by running "dcop kded mediamanager fullList" in a Konsole window.
01:11	<roostishaw>	can GTK 2.0 themes slow down gnome?

01:12	<Yoric>	roostishaw, I'm pretty sure they can
01:12	<Jowi>	roostishaw: yes
01:12	<Flannel>	Fastly: you might get more luck in #kubuntu
01:12	<Shaezsche>	how do i install the latest ubuntu on an external usb HD?
01:12	<crywolf_3>	 i tried to play a dvd and get this message, Failed to play Audio/Video Disc
01:12	<BioVorE>	Fastly: is you sound device setup right?

01:13	<Shaezsche>	??
01:13	<BioVorE>	Fastly: what back end is aramok using? xine?
01:13	<Cas>	Shaezsche: you could if you can make the disk bootable in your BIOS
01:13	<Shaezsche>	ok
01:13	<Shaezsche>	and then it will install without any further tinkering?
01:14	<Fastly>	think so... will check..
01:14	<_clem>	Shaezsche : there is a new release tomorrow, you should wait till then...
01:14	<Shaezsche>	also, will this affect my battery life? switching from windows xp to ubuntu.
01:14	<Shaezsche>	i just dled the lts kubuntu
01:14	<roostishaw>	Jowi or Yoric, then what is the 'fastest' theme? the default one from the ubuntu install?
01:14	<crywolf_3>	i get an error when i tried to play a dvd, Failed to play Audio/Video Disc
01:14	<crywolf_3>	why
01:14	<_clem>	Shaezsche : well... will the usb be seen as /dev/sda1 always.... would it not break grub if it moved to /dev/sda2 ?
01:14	<Kyral>	!dvd
01:14	<ubotu>	DVD playing is possible in ubuntu. You may need libdvdcss2, which is available via http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages (section extras)
01:14	<TTT_Travis>	I thought dapper was supposed to be coming out in 45 minutes
01:15	<Mic__hael>	Shaezsche: battery life could be less with ubuntu, it depends
01:15	<kspath_>	TTT_Travis: /topic
01:15	<TTT_Travis>	yeah
01:15	<TTT_Travis>	I know
01:15	<dave>	crywolf_3: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats#head-49d7b89e22f864732e033a68a77cfe144f23af8c
01:15	<Shaezsche>	michael, how much less? and depends on what
01:15	<TTT_Travis>	but someone told me 8 EST

01:15	<ubotu>	restricted is, like, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats  Most of the formats listed there can be replaced by !FreeFormats
01:15	<Shaezsche>	whya re the kubuntu and xubuntu LTS releases out before the ubuntu?
01:16	<atzar>	what is the equivalent of cubase on Linux ?
01:16	<Mic__hael>	Shaezsche: by default, it's usually less, but people who pay attention to it manage to get more out of their batteries with ubuntu... I don't know how, and I don't remember how long my batteries lasted with xp
01:16	<aleksander>	via_strass: and you'll finally need to ad this line to your /etc/fstab: /dev/hdax none swap sw 0 0
01:16	<TTT_Travis>	if I install the daily build for yesterday will it be about the same?
01:16	<Seveas>	atzar, I wish there was one...
01:16	<kspath_>	atzar: apt-cache search keyword
01:16	<TTT_Travis>	wait nevermind, I actually want the server version
01:16	<aleksander>	via_strass: and an x stands for the number of your swap partition
01:16	<Shaezsche>	whya re the kubuntu and xubuntu LTS releases out before the ubuntu?
01:16	<_clem>	Shaezsche: what makes you say that ?
01:16	<aleksander>	via_strass: you'll be able to check it with fdisk -l
01:16	<Jowi>	roostishaw: "simple" is very quick. Wonderlooks or Bluecurve are also pretty good (those are gtk (or button/widget themes))
01:16	<atzar>	Seveas: you mean, there's no ?
01:16	<mawa>	I run ubuntu on an older powermac g4 and i cant seem to access the capture controls or get the microphone to record any sound. any suggestions?

01:22	<Stormx2>	Abo:  :D YAY!

01:23	<ubotu>	hmm... realplayer is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
01:23	<crazybob>	!forum

01:24	<aleksander>	Abo: alt+f2 and gksudo "update-manager -d"
01:24	<Flannel>	Seveas, once dapper is released, it will ask to update without any invervention (update manager) right?
01:24	<_clem>	ompaul : It was for Abo, not for me.
01:24	<dmbt>	i here on breezy, there is a nice graphical upgrader gui for dapper
01:24	<Stormx2>	I don't think so.
01:24	<Seveas>	Flannel, sudo update-manager -d already works...
01:24	<Jowi>	joelito: last time i tried the torrent was really quick
01:24	<hyperactivecrond>	what time did we officialy release (GMT Time?) Dapper?
01:24	<ompaul>	no
01:24	<Flannel>	hyperactivecrond: see topic
01:24	<hyperactivecrond>	ah whoops didnt' read the /topic
01:24	<Seveas>	hyperactivecrond, /topic
01:24	<rackerz>	1AM apprently.
01:25	<Stormx2>	It isn't released yet, foo;
01:25	<Seveas>	rackerz, no
01:25	<ompaul>	that would be UTC
01:25	<rackerz>	Yeah i didn't think so.
01:25	<joelito>	Good, 'cause i'll need the ISOs as soon as I can get them
01:25	<Newbify2>	anyone know if there is a bittorrent for it?
01:25	<Stormx2>	Dude
01:25	<Archville>	Seveas:  Do you know what version of Gedit is bundled in the Dapper release ?
01:25	<hyperactivecrond>	becuase the announces are in the wiki
01:25	<Archville>	I think i've found a bug on the latest one.
01:25	<rackerz>	Is this the official Ubuntu channel?
01:25	<Seveas>	joe_user, then download the latest daily now and rsync after release 
01:25	<Flannel>	Seveas: ah, I didn't know if that was wise for general public, or if it were just for beta upgrades.  Thanks for the clarification.
01:25	<crazybob>	i thought it was released in 30+ minutes according to the fridge
01:25	<dmbt>	rackerz: yes
01:25	<Seveas>	joelito*
01:25	<Seveas>	rackerz, yes
01:25	<sutur>	in 5minutes and 30seconds...
01:25	<rackerz>	Ty,
01:25	<Stormx2>	Is our cosmonaut overlord gonna join IRC and be like "Now, creatures, feast on our duck!!"
01:25	<Seveas>	crazybob, fridge is incorrect
01:25	<hyperactivecrond>	sutur: lol
01:25	<crywolf_3>	i type the code in the terminal but its not installed
01:25	<dmbt>	rackerz: although iright now its a bit hectic in here
01:26	<crazybob>	ok
01:26	<Seveas>	Stormx2, no
01:26	<ompaul>	Newbify2, there needs to be downloads of the binaryies to seed for the torrents
01:26	<Stormx2>	oh :(
01:26	<Jowi>	rackerz: yeah, but atm everyone is a bit frantic
01:26	<Flannel>	crazybob: no, fridge just defaulted to 00:00 for the time, and is counting down from that.
01:26	<crywolf_3>	i typed realplayer code in the terminal
01:26	<Stormx2>	oh man
01:26	<Stormx2>	I wanted it to be like the y2k stuff
01:26	<rackerz>	Yeah I'm guessing it is. Dapper release today.
01:26	<crywolf_3>	 dut it wont install
01:26	<Stormx2>	like everyone counting down
01:26	<hyperactivecrond>	sutur: you aren't serious, are you:

01:27	<TiG4>	--- Is there a program that allows me to keep a window ontop of all other windows? ---
01:27	<hyperactivecrond>	mcmahons: /topic
01:27	<mcmahons>	Stormx2: i was joking i read it :)
01:27	<Versed>	probably I would think sometime around or after 8am gmt.  could be wrong.
01:27	<Felyduw>	upgrading now... wee :D
01:27	<Stormx2>	Ah I see
01:27	<Stormx2>	
01:27	<mcmahons>	same to you hyper :)
01:27	<Newbify2>	ompaul, ok yea I was just wondering, because it seems like this will be a very popular release and a bittorrent would be nice to save bandwidth from the mirrors
01:27	<dmbt>	so, its going to be released in a couple minutes ;)
01:27	<Stormx2>	maybe
01:27	<mcmahons>	Newwbify2: haha who cares shuttleworth's paying for it :)
01:27	<Seveas>	Versed, keep this a secret, but I heard from some of the lead developers that morning or midday isn't unlikely
01:27	<ompaul>	Newbify2, well no doubt some people will have it on torrent as soon as they upload for it
01:28	<Stormx2>	How come our cosmonaut overlord is so rich?
01:28	<Stormx2>	does he have shares in google?
01:28	<Versed>	I'm thinking more from what makes sense then from speculation.
01:28	<Seveas>	Stormx2, bankrobbery
01:28	<dmbt>	Stormx2: becauase he is smart
01:28	<Stormx2>	Oh ok
01:28	<Versed>	or any rumors.
01:28	<Flannel>	Stormx2: usually rich people have lots of money, so, I imagine that's why.
01:28	<ompaul>	mcmahons, we all should, better to get it to an extra 5 people who can't afford it on CDs than waste it on bandwidth tarriffs
01:28	<Seveas>	Flannel, ROFLQ

01:50	<Plouj>	but seriously, why is ubuntu so slow on my machine that I can see how each terminal is redrawing itself when I have two terms and firefox open?
01:50	<ubotu>	Bugger all, I dunno. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Sammi84
01:50	<ompaul>	apokryphos, where did 8am come from
01:50	<gnomefreak>	hyperactivecrond: im on est time i know its -4
01:50	<rackerz>	9 hours till what?
01:50	<utUtu>	is that joke about the Mandrake trademark?
01:50	<MTecknology>	czamran, no shit - i'm on dapper

01:51	<Linuturk_NB>	http://www.cafepress.com/ubuntushop.14580695 << these so rock
01:51	<bsdfox>	thanks
01:51	<bsdfox>	Plouj so do I
01:51	<Roger_The_Bum>	wow
01:51	<_clem>	Plouj: depends on your hardware, configuration... I say troubleshoot... but it certainly wrong to say that Ubuntu is slow, it sure isn't for a lot of people (and I also mean a lot of old computers).
01:51	<Plouj>	what can I do to try to enable direct rendering?
01:51	<bsdfox>	Plouj I use glx
01:51	<crywolf_3>	can u help me with instalin realplayer?
01:51	<Roger_The_Bum>	how is the server not DDoS'ed
01:51	<apokryphos>	crywolf_3: /msg ubotu realplayer
01:51	<bsdfox>	Plouj DRI is more important for ati cards
01:51	<Roger_The_Bum>	ubuntu IS the best!
01:51	<Plouj>	bsdfox: what are you talking about?
01:52	<Plouj>	glxinfo |grep direct
01:52	<Plouj>	direct rendering: No
01:52	<bsdfox>	yeah
01:52	<Plouj>	I think that is causing my system slowness
01:52	<Stormx2>	We have to organise a mexican wave
01:52	<ompaul>	crywolf_3, read the message the bot sent you, there is a URL inthere it will get you sorted
01:52	<gnomefreak>	welcome HedgeMage ;)
01:52	<Stormx2>	For when it comes out
01:52	<Stormx2>	where we all say something very deep.
01:52	<bsdfox>	Plouj what do you score in `glxgears -printfps`
01:52	<Stormx2>	Like names of fuit
01:52	<Stormx2>	fruit*
01:52	<Stormx2>	or something...
01:52	<HedgeMage>	hi gnomefreak
01:52	<sapote1>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
01:52	<hyperactivecrond>	hold your breath. it is scientifically proven that holding one's breath speeds up the process
01:53	<Jowi>	Plouj: dri is only useful for accellerated 3d afaik
01:53	<Plouj>	bsdfox: about 866.317 FPS
01:53	<Ophiocus>	will there be much of a change for dapper beta users in a few hours or we just get to watch the rest of the comunity go heels over head for code we already have?
01:53	<bsdfox>	Plouj damn, I am getting 6800 with my 6600gt
01:53	<bsdfox>	6800fps
01:53	<Slappy>	lol
01:53	<hyperactivecrond>	We'll tell you when it's relased. just keep holding your breath. that's right...
01:53	<Slappy>	4000 here
01:53	<Plouj>	cuz direct rendering is on for you, no?
01:53	<Knorrie>	Ophiocus: you can watch it in here ;-)
01:53	<_clem>	Ophiocus : you just get to watch people go crazy I guess :)
01:53	<crimsun>	Ophiocus: if you're current, you already have it.
01:53	<czambran>	Ophiocus: I wonder the same
01:54	<Stormx2>	Ophiocus: Hi
01:54	<Plouj>	anyways, isn't there a way to enable direct rendering?
01:54	<hyperactivecrond>	Capn_Refsmmat: as opposed to what, Debian
01:54	<Seveas>	Capn_Refsmmat, they are *NOT*
01:54	<DarkTower>	I hope you can use the old installer in dapper, the graphical has got problems
01:54	<hyperactivecrond>	oops did i say that aloud?
01:54	<teckfatt>	yeah..... another 6 min
01:54	<_clem>	Ophiocus : In these moments you understand Debian users better..
01:54	<s|k>	I tried kde for the fun of it, god it is ugly :<
01:54	<Seveas>	they are *TEST* images
01:54	<crimsun>	DarkTower: yes, that's the alternate.
01:54	<apokryphos>	DarkTower: no, it should be fine.
01:54	<petrik>	When it is released no one will be able to get it as the servers will be jammed
01:54	<Capn_Refsmmat>	Seveas: I know... hence "seem"
01:54	<gnomefreak>	its not the final
01:54	<bruce89>	alternate Cd is the old installer
01:54	<Roger_The_Bum>	8 EST?
01:54	<sutur>	hyperactivecrond: im beginning to see black spots...
01:54	<Seveas>	teckfatt, +several hours
01:54	<apokryphos>	bruce89: nope. Alternative CD is live+install
01:54	<Roger_The_Bum>	o
01:54	<hyperactivecrond>	sutur: just keep holding... and don't have your next of kin sue me
01:54	<apokryphos>	bruce89: argh, I mean it is the old installer, sorry.
01:55	<Stormx2>	They're just doing what all the good bands do at concerts; make the fans wait!
01:55	<apokryphos>	desktop is live+install
01:55	<Linuturk_NB>	 yo, ive got a modified cuecat barcode scanner. It spits out a UPS in plain ASCII. It connects via a PS/2 interupt on the keyboard. It works fine on a windows machine, but in Ubuntu, it spits out different numbers everytime I scan the same barcode. Anyone help?
01:55	<Roger_The_Bum>	apokryphos, yeah
01:55	<gnomefreak>	bruce89: alternatate is the install cd not the live
01:55	<bruce89>	no, i'm sure its the old one
01:55	<apokryphos>	and DVD is alternative+desktop
01:55	<dmbt>	have a question
=== HellDragon is now known as HellDragon|CSS
01:55	<Roger_The_Bum>	wait
01:55	<r0xoR>	can anyone tell me roughly how much didfference there is between brezzy and dapper... i.e. after a fresh "default install" is there much different?
01:55	<sutur>	dapper..... its.... here ... i can.....toucht IT
01:55	<Roger_The_Bum>	is there a DVD
01:55	<DarkTower>	apokryphos: No its not. I create 4 partitions but it only lets me assign two, thus not giving any swap, which it says you need to do. Then half way through it warns i havent set any swap, which is true because it was impossible
01:55	<dmbt>	does the gui installer stil linstall all the debs sepereately
=== HellDragon|CSS is now known as HellDragon|ET
01:55	<dmbt>	>
01:55	<bruce89>	lots
01:55	<gnomefreak>	apokryphos: its desktop also?
01:55	<hyperactivecrond>	r0xoR: yes
01:55	<leon>	its orange
01:55	<Fastly>	guys, for some reason my NetworkManager applet is reporting that "no networking devices have been found" ... i have tried reinstalling it and even rebooting and no joy... any ideas?
01:55	<teckfatt>	4 min......
01:55	<Roger_The_Bum>	r0xoR, yeah
01:55	<czambran>	r0xoR: Oh yes!
01:55	<sapote1>	e2e5e0bfb2edffd2ce02dd77bda4558e  ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso    MD5 sum
01:55	<apokryphos>	DarkTower: well, you don't have final, do you?
01:55	<Roger_The_Bum>	it can do woreless
01:55	<apokryphos>	gnomefreak: yup
01:55	<Seveas>	dmbt, no, the gui installer copies the live filesystem
01:55	<sskroeder>	hi .. this may sound as a silly request - but is there some way that i can de-install all packages that aren't part of the default Ubuntu install -- I've installed a lot of packages to try them out - and now i can't tell the ones that came with the system from those that i've subsequently installed ...-- how can i get back to a "clean install" - without having to actually re-install
01:55	<dmbt>	ah
01:55	<hyperactivecrond>	as opposed to feces brown (no offense to anyone with artwork)
01:55	<r0xoR>	aight, so it's worth waiting until tomorow?
01:56	<bruce89>	I do't think it really is 4mins
01:56	<apokryphos>	r0xoR: at the least, yes.
01:56	<Fastly>	the Network Monitor 2.12.0 built into gnome is working...
01:56	<crywolf_3>	i cant seems to get help here
01:56	<hyperactivecrond>	crywolf_3: what is your question?
01:56	<bruce89>	why
01:56	<Stormx2>	crywolf_3: What is the problem?
01:56	<teckfatt>	we will see after 3 min
01:56	<DarkTower>	apokryphos: thats true. I hope since 3 days ago theyve also put back the ability to do software RAID, because thats no longer possible
01:56	<dmbt>	crywolf_3: its a bit hectic in here
01:56	<crazybob>	crywolf_3 try the forums?
01:56	<Stormx2>	crywolf_3: How hard is it to follow a howto?
01:56	<_clem>	sskroeder: you should read about APT... you're going to love it.
01:56	<czambran>	Fastly:  for me it's not
01:56	<petrik>	Oh well I'm of to work so will not be able to get my grubby hands on it ofr at least another 9 hours
01:56	<hyperactivecrond>	crywolf_3: /msg me

01:56	<sskroeder>	_clem, i've been browsing throug the man pages - but haven't found an suitable answer
01:57	<bruce89>	i was saying bye to someone else
01:57	<reydeluniverso>	HOLA REY
01:57	<czambran>	Fastly: the network manager
01:57	<Stormx2>	sskroeder: I dunno man
01:57	<_clem>	sskroeder: sudo aptitude remove thepackagename
01:57	<bruce89>	the new website layot is interesting...
01:57	<Fastly>	hmm.... czambran, did you upgrade to dapper recently too?
01:57	<Stormx2>	_clem: Thats what he need
01:57	<Stormx2>	bruce89: For which website
01:57	<nahoj>	this channel is getting to big for it's own good....
01:57	<reydeluniverso>	DEMONIOS
01:57	<Roger_The_Bum>	brb
01:57	<bruce89>	ubuntu's
01:57	<_clem>	sskroeder: but I really insist on the fact that you should read the doc about APT from the Debian website. It's a must-read.
01:57	<bruce89>	http://www.ubuntu.com
01:58	<your_mom>	i broke x, how can i fix it? dpkg-configure xserver-xorg dosent work
01:58	<Roger_The_Bum>	don't release without me
01:58	<teckfatt>	is anyone sure the dapper going to release in next 1 min?
01:58	<sskroeder>	_clem, I know how to remove a package - but i wouldn't want to remove some component, that may have to be used later...
01:58	<Stormx2>	Oh we to make a mark shuttleworth website! like! a fansite! with ponies and animated gifs!
01:58	<czambran>	Fastly: I mean it kind of is, but it doesn;t work with my wireless only with the wired one
01:58	<czambran>	teckfatt: read the title
01:58	<hyperactivecrond>	Seveas: maybe we should have people talking about the release in another channel?
01:58	<Flannel>	sskroeder: well, one way would be to mark everything for uninstallation, then reinstall ubuntu-desktop.  That'll unmark everything requires.  Of course, I don't know if there's a problem wth that or not.
01:58	<Fastly>	doesn't work with either for me
01:58	<Seveas>	Stormx2, NO YOU CAN'T HAVE A PONY!
01:58	<Stormx2>	teckfatt: you'll be lucky if its the next hour
01:58	<bruce89>	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
01:58	<czambran>	hyperactivecrond: what for?
01:58	<Stormx2>	:( But daadddyyyy
01:58	<apokryphos>	hyperactivecrond: nah, it's ok to have a little hype :)
01:58	<Seveas>	hyperactivecrond, good luck with that ;)
01:58	<GaiaX11>	How do i recover my grub? apt-get install grub-install hd0?
01:58	<Zambezi>	Is somebody waiting here for Ubuntu? Acctually waiting until it comes?

01:58	<Seveas>	Sammi84, +several hours
01:58	<_clem>	sskroeder: it won't remove things that are used. If you'll need them "later" they'll get reinstalled when needed. APT is great at that.
01:58	<bruce89>	especially iif you look at the testinbg data for the latest cd build...
01:58	<apokryphos>	Roger_The_Bum: ?
01:58	<DarkTower>	Sammi84: really?
01:58	<Agrajag>	no it's not.
01:59	<Capn_Refsmmat>	Sammi84: omgwtfbbq
01:59	<kspath_>	DarkTower: no
01:59	<Sammi84>	heheh according to fridge.ubuntu.com :)
01:59	<Roger_The_Bum>	do you read slashdot?
01:59	<bruce89>	yikes, it's hectic in here
01:59	<gnomefreak>	Sammi84: its not gonna be released in the next hr or 2 give it time
01:59	<your_mom>	i uninstalled xorg, so x is broken anyway to fix
01:59	<sskroeder>	Flannel, i'll try it out - see if it does the trick...
01:59	<leon>	dont really like the decayed font
01:59	<Stormx2>	Roger_The_Bum: You're asking someone on freenode. of course he reads slashdot
01:59	<apokryphos>	Sammi84: nope, that's nto really an announcement.
01:59	<bruce89>	fridge is just saying 00:00, as it the beginning of the day
01:59	<Roger_The_Bum>	yeah

02:01	<Nullified>	I changed my graphics card from a (AGP) 9800PRO to a (PCIE) X700PRO , X doesnt like this and refuses to run GDM, Is there anyway to make it boot as if it were the first time and let it configure itself

02:01	<your_mom>	i uninstalled xorg, so x is broken anyway to fix? please

02:01	<ubotu>	NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, MTecknology
02:01	<hyperactivecrond>	thenetduck: hold your breath. we'll tell u when its ready. hlding your breath speeds up the process. seriously.
02:01	<apokryphos>	Stormx2: Swedish police ;-)
02:01	<thenetduck>	lol
02:01	<thenetduck>	im gasping
02:01	<HedgeMage>	your_mom: install xorg again :P
02:01	<Flannel>	the FRIDGE uses 00:00 as the default time for something that happens "on a day".
02:01	<hyperactivecrond>	MTecknology: that only works in #debian with !topicbanter
02:01	<czambran>	hyperactivecrond: ;)
02:01	<bosco>	kspath_, that is what they said in the dapper room
02:01	<thenetduck>	*holding breath now*
02:01	<Stormx2>	Oh man
02:01	<Plouj>	oh, I really don't know why, but Ubuntu 32bit is super slow compared to my Gentoo installed on the second system - right now, I'm compiling wine in ubuntu, and typing is awful due to the huge lag
02:01	<HedgeMage>	your_mom: apt-get install xorg
02:01	<bruce89>	I think that it would be a good idea if people needing support go to the forums
02:01	<bruce89>	mind you we are a bit preoccupied
02:01	<_clem>	you must hate fridge..... :))))
02:02	<MTecknology>	hyperactivecrond, what only works?
02:02	<apokryphos>	bruce89: nope, support is still fine here
02:02	<eXistenZ>	so
02:02	<hyperactivecrond>	_clem: lay off the excess punctuatoin
02:02	<Roger_The_Bum>	mmm fridger\

02:03	<hyperactivecrond>	LinuxMonkey: how canyou be on mIRC on linux?

02:03	<LinuxMonkey>	my bad i just woke up
02:03	<BrianHH>	Hi Everyone.  Can anyone help me getting my Palm to sync?  I've been trying to get it to attach to my docking station for my laptop.  When I run dmesg, it shows the Palm attaching to port ttyUSB1 *and* port ttyUSB2, and then disconnecting.  Can anyone help me unravel this?
02:03	<LinuxMonkey>	IRC
02:04	<DarkTower>	ban Mirc lol
02:04	<apokryphos>	which actually works in wine
02:04	<dmbt>	i don't like mirc
02:04	<apokryphos>	(but yes, don't use it)
02:04	<DrewMarin>	ok how do I get vba to run in a gui
02:04	<DrewMarin>	gvba wont work
02:04	<dmbt>	its just not as good as xchat or chatzilla

02:04	<Seveas>	InvisiblePinkUni, yes
02:04	<firestorm>	xchat for windows isnt free
02:05	<Stormx2>	oww bloody battery acid. i need a drink.
02:05	<hyperactivecrond>	people who wish to ask about when dapper is released... direct your output to /dev/null.

02:05	<apokryphos>	I'm sure we'll get way into the 900s at actual release time :)
02:05	<Seveas>	26 users short of being the biggest channel on freenode
02:05	<bimberi>	I've not seen #ubuntu with more uses than #debian before
02:05	<Klaynos>	firestorm: there are good free builds
02:05	<apokryphos>	Seveas: #gentoo still bigger?
02:05	<Stormx2>	Ill advertise
02:05	<Seveas>	apokryphos, slightly
02:05	<crimsun>	Seveas: won't hold for long :-)
02:05	<Seveas>	crimsun, yeah
02:05	<apokryphos>	bimberi: it has in the last few weeks or so
02:05	<bruce89>	900s now

02:05	<bruce89>	899 now
02:05	<Klaynos>	and I see I've beating silverx.org into Capn_Refsmmat enough for him to link it...
02:05	<_clem>	DrewMarin: what is gvba ?
02:05	<hyperactivecrond>	#ubuntu-offtopic for offtopic banter. please. it's too loud in here
02:05	<Plouj>	how do I disable shift+backspace zapping?
02:06	<apokryphos>	how many times have you heard there being /. entry that "Distro X WILL be released in the next week"?
02:06	<bimberi>	apokryphos: it will change a lot on June 4 (when they point to OFTC)
02:06	<Capn_Refsmmat>	Klaynos: :D
02:06	<hyperactivecrond>	Plouj: don't use XGL
02:06	<hyperactivecrond>	:)

02:06	<Plouj>	darn thing
02:06	<porjo>	Is there an alternative panel Clock to the default? I prefer the look of KDE's Clock with the LCD look. Is there something similar for gnome?

02:09	<Hitchhiker>	Will Dapper Drake come with xgl?
02:09	<ubuntu>	ALGUIEN HABLA ESPAOL
02:09	<Flannel>	alright, guys, take the game talk to #ubuntu-offtopic.
02:09	<ubuntu>	??????????????
02:09	<Flannel>	Hitchhiker: no.  Edgy will.
02:09	<LinuxMonkey>	are the servers that will distribute the dapper on dapper them self or atleast running ubuntu?
02:09	<dmbt>	 Hitchhiker :no
02:09	<Roger_The_Bum>	yo lo hablo
02:09	<DrewMarin>	of I have seen the movie of xgl its awsome
02:09	<coolguy>	hola amigo
02:09	<czambran>	Does anybody know why would my mic stop working all of the sudden?
02:09	<Rambo3>	!ops
02:09	<ubotu>	Help! lilo, hedgemage, lamont, Keybuk, jdub, mdz, Amaranth, tritium, ajmitch, crimsun, ogra, CarlK, Seveas, Burgundavia, apokryphos, thoreauputic, nalioth, Madpilot, ompaul, rob, Hobbsee or gnomefreak!
02:09	<ubuntu>	Hola
02:09	<hyperactivecrond>	!es
02:09	<ubotu>	Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
02:09	<Seveas>	Rambo3, ?
02:09	<crimsun>	LinuxMonkey: no.
02:09	<andrejkw>	Yay!
02:09	<bruce89>	and even in edgy XGL will have to be optional
02:09	<bruce89>	sort of
02:09	<andrejkw>	They're preparing for Dapper Drake now!!
02:10	<SurfnKid>	!deb
02:10	<_clem>	ubuntu : si, pero la gente habla ingles aqui. Por favor, va a #ubuntu-es
02:10	<ubotu>	To install a .deb file: sudo dpkg -i filename.deb  (but note that the program you want might be installable using !apt from the !repos)
02:10	<hyperactivecrond>	!tell SurfnKid about msgthebot
02:10	<ubuntu>	Lo que pasa es que es la primera vez que uso ubuntu para chatear
02:10	<DrewMarin>	what does it do exactly I saw the trailer but didnt understand it
02:10	<bruce89>	8-16 hours i say
02:10	<ubuntu>	!!1
02:10	<Rambo3>	sry , thougt i would list ops to see if i had to listen to flannel
02:10	<ubotu>	Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, ubuntu
02:10	<Roger_The_Bum>	!tell Roger_The_Bum about msgthebot
02:10	<Hitchhiker>	Of course, at this point, XGL really needs to be optional... I just tried it with SuSE 10.1, and XGL is very beta...
02:10	<Flannel>	bruce89: it'll always be optional.  But it will be supported on edgy, you can get it to work on dapper, but it's not supported.
02:10	<SurfnKid>	whats that command dpkg to unzip and setup *.deb files
02:10	<apokryphos>	Rambo3: you should use /chanserv access #channel list
02:10	<nbx909>	ubuntu, no hablamos espanol
02:10	<eyequeue>	i've got a question on the dapper cdimage ... is there a way to d/l the parts that won't change, only grabbing the "this is the final release" parts later? (to get ready to seed a torrent in a few hours)?
02:10	<DarkTower>	i thought dapper supported xgl
02:10	<DrewMarin>	what is xgl for just fun
02:10	<[zero] >	:( I broke my pc
02:10	<nbx909>	!es
02:10	<ubotu>	Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
02:11	<Ademan>	is it a bad idea to install a package from a *.deb file (not from the repository) ? will it be easy to remove? will i theoretically be able to install the next version without installing the old? do ineed to keep the old package around?
02:11	<Flannel>	DrewMarin: google it, there's a video, you really have to see it.  It's eyecandy, basically.
02:11	<bimberi>	eyequeue: yes, using rsync
02:11	<DrewMarin>	yea I have seen the video
02:11	<DrewMarin>	looked awsome
02:11	<hyperactivecrond>	Por favor, no abusar ud. el bot.
02:11	<crimsun>	just rysnc from the daily
02:11	<DarkTower>	yes but how do u inswtall xgl on dapper?
02:11	<DrewMarin>	Ill look for it now
02:11	<bruce89>	over 900 again
02:11	<Flannel>	DarkTower: #ubuntu-xgl
02:11	<hyperactivecrond>	god i suck @ spanish
02:11	<krazykit>	Ademan: only bad if the deb installs libraries or something.  if it's a program, it's /usually/ ok.
02:11	<dmbt>	wow, 900 people in this room
02:11	<apokryphos>	DarkTower: /msg ubotu xgl
02:11	<bruce89>	let's see if we can get over 10000
02:11	<DrewMarin>	since I upgraded to 6.06 lts today
02:11	<bruce89>	*1000
02:11	<eyequeue>	bimberi, ah yes, makes sense, thanks for reminding me of what i should have already known :)
02:11	<Hitchhiker>	XGL renders your entire X session through OpenGL, so you can do all kinds of crazy stuff like wobbly windows, switching desktops on a 3d cube, transparencies, etc.
02:11	<Alexiel>	.list
02:11	<Alexiel>	oops
02:11	<crimsun>	10k would be a bit much.
02:11	<Hitchhiker>	It's pretty fast, too
02:11	<DarkTower>	!xgl
02:11	<ubotu>	hmm... xgl is "XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/"

02:12	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
02:12	<sapote1>	#ubuntu-es
02:12	<DrewMarin>	ok why isnt xgl in synapatic I have 6.06 lts
02:12	<Jeeves_>	caldo: I agree
02:12	<crimsun>	DrewMarin: enable universe
02:12	<hyperactivecrond>	!tell DrewMarin about XGL
02:12	<Jeeves_>	There should have been a countdown party
02:12	<LinuxJones>	God there are 900 people in here
02:12	<hyperactivecrond>	no ponies for you
02:12	<Ademan>	krazykit: ok, what would the case be that it wouldnt be?
02:12	<caldo>	still, i'm getting rip roaringly drunk in anticipation :-)
02:12	<DrewMarin>	i know about xgl
02:12	<Flannel>	Jeeves_: that would require us to know when it'll be released.
02:12	<dmbt>	we should play that song 'Final Contdown' in the party
02:12	<caldo>	that and half life episode one should come out tomorrow
02:12	<apokryphos>	DrewMarin: go to #ubuntu-xgl
02:12	<Seveas>	"The suspense is killing us"
02:13	<DShepherd>	LinuxJones: yes God knows. no need to remind him :-)
02:13	<caldo>	june 1 is good to geeks
02:13	<hyperactivecrond>	that should be a #ubuntu inside joke like "Ramone" on opie and anthony.
02:13	<DrewMarin>	k

02:13	<LinuxJones>	:)
02:13	<hyperactivecrond>	the whole pony thing
02:13	<krazykit>	Ademan: some programs depend on different library versions and will simply die.
02:13	<Jeeves_>	Flannel: They've had 8 months to figure that out :)
02:13	<dmbt>	will we beat #gentoo in users?
02:13	<rackerz>	Their all wanting Dapper, but their not getting!
02:13	<caldo>	barbie horse adventure?
02:13	<crimsun>	Seveas: but I want dapper /now/!
02:13	<Stormx2>	!tell hyperactivecrond about coc

02:13	<hyperactivecrond>	Stormx2: can i /msg you
02:13	<dmbt>	BadriNarayan: i think its usually less than 700
02:13	<apokryphos>	BadriNarayan: under 800 or so
02:13	<Seveas>	BadriNarayan, 700-800
02:13	<Jeeves_>	Seveas: Still not sleeping?
02:13	<caldo>	phh
02:13	<_clem>	I want my Dapper now !!! If you're not giving it to me, I'm going to bed ! End of story !
02:13	<caldo>	pitiful gentoo
02:13	<Ademan>	krazykit: but as far as a program... do i need to keep the *.deb around to uninstall?
02:13	<Seveas>	Jeeves_, no
02:13	<apokryphos>	krazykit: no, it has 922
02:13	<Stormx2>	hyperactivecrond: You can try
02:13	<_clem>	ok I'm going to bed...
02:13	<_clem>	:)
02:13	<Jeeves_>	Seveas: You were awfully quiet :)
02:13	<DShepherd>	krazykit: its 900 plus.. i just checked
02:14	<LinuxMonkey>	im just waiting for someone to blurt out... Its up its up. and be a joke and have all of ya rush to the website...lol
02:14	<rackerz>	Can I have a pony :D
02:14	<Stormx2>	ok, night nigh _clem!
02:14	<Hitchhiker>	Amusingly, I'm looking to try Ubuntu for the first time today, since I've gotten rather disgusted with SuSE 10.1... synchornicity for dapper :)
02:14	<BadriNarayan>	Thank you. Then 900 isn't extraordinarily high?
02:14	<Seveas>	Jeeves_, heh 
02:14	<nbx909>	902 people lol
02:14	<DrewMarin>	_clem: u can update to it I got 6.06 lts
02:14	<krazykit>	DShepherd and apokryphos i just checked too :-P
02:14	<_clem>	gnight guys :)
02:14	<rixxon>	what do i need to extract a rar split to multiple archives (.rar .r00 .r01 ...)?
02:14	<caldo>	just put opera on a 5 second refresh
02:14	<DShepherd>	krazykit: :-)
02:14	<tested2>	Slightly off topic but anyone know how I can have xchat only highlight a channel when my nick is mentioned?
02:14	<crimsun>	rixxon: unrar-nonfree in breezy.
02:14	<rixxon>	crimsun: nonfree?
02:14	<_clem>	I know I know... but I want to review the graphical installer.. :)
02:14	<apokryphos>	caldo: it'll still be quite a few hours
02:14	<paradon>	From memory, Breezy was released at 0700 UTC, so there'll probably still be a big wait for Dapper :-(
02:14	<crimsun>	rixxon: the name of breezy's package is 'unrar-nonfree', in multiverse
02:14	<Flannel>	tested2: it does that by default.  the red highlight.
02:14	<_clem>	see you tomorrow. Patience is a vertue (or something like that..). :)
02:14	<krazykit>	Ademan: no, you don't.  the uninstall stuff sticks around.  you just need to remove it with your favorite method, be that synaptic or dpkg
02:15	<crimsun>	rixxon: the dapper one is 'unrar', also in multiverse
02:15	<rixxon>	crimsun: does it mean it is not free? :P
02:15	<tested2>	Flannel, yeah but I only want it to highlight then
02:15	<Flannel>	rixxon: Free as in speech, not free as in beer, in that case.
02:15	<caldo>	i need dapper, i have a memory leak on this machine with 382 days of uptime
02:15	<bruce89>	you can watch with this eye
02:15	<DShepherd>	_clem: virtue.. that's better :-)
02:15	<hyperactivecrond>	apt-get install pacman
02:15	<bruce89>	or with this eye
02:15	<crimsun>	rixxon: no, the packager was angry he didn't get a pony and randomly appended the "-nonfree" part.
02:15	<caldo>	it's going down fast!
02:15	<tested2>	Im talking about the channel name in the tabs not the text box
02:15	<guano>	well ... i guess i found out everything  need to know.. it won't be a midnight release :(
02:15	<rixxon>	heh
02:15	<Ademan>	krazykit: i'm not entirely comfortable with dpkg so, is there a way in synaptic i can view all of my installed packages?
02:16	<eric>	can anyone tell me if its possible to instal shockwave player on ubuntu ????
02:16	<hyperactivecrond>	pacman -Sy apt-get
02:16	<DShepherd>	Ademan: yes..
02:16	<Seveas>	eric, it's not
02:16	<bruce89>	nope 8-16 hours away i would predixt
02:16	<Stormx2>	No release parties in England. What a suprise
02:16	<bruce89>	any bets?
02:16	<hyperactivecrond>	pacman -R apt-get *
02:16	<hollywoodb>	tested2: it'll highlight in red for activity, blue if your name has been mentioned
02:16	<Flannel>	tested2: right, doesn't the text of the tab go red (as opposed to black) when you've been mentioned? (sorry, It's been a while since Ive used xchat)
02:16	<ollo82>	pacman is from arch linux, right?
02:16	<caldo>	apt-get install dapper damnit!
02:16	<LinuxMonkey>	c'mon the suspence killed me allready, im am now a ghost...im sure the iso's are all ready on the server and been locked for the past day
02:16	<crimsun>	bruce89: yeah, that's pretty close.
02:16	<dark-messias>	como escrever em fat32 a partir do ubuntu?
02:16	<DarkTower>	can ekiga be used to call phones by having a paid for account with a provider?
02:16	<bruce89>	I say we should have a wiki page which guesses whenreleases happen
02:16	<MTecknology>	where is ubuntus bug database
02:16	<DarkTower>	like skyupe
02:16	<bruce89>	like the million pool in WP
02:16	<BadriNarayan>	hyperactivecrond: I think the pacman in ubuntu is not what you think it is :p
02:16	<Flannel>	MTecknology: launchpad
02:16	<bruce89>	etc.
02:16	<Seveas>	MTecknology, bugs.ubuntu.com
02:17	<crimsun>	LinuxMonkey: yes, they're being rsynced around the world
02:17	<myleftfoot>	caldo: you need dapper or I diaper for the leak?
02:17	<MTecknology>	ty
02:17	<mcmahons>	LinuxMonkey: the devs are all just sitting in this channel laughing at us
02:17	<DShepherd>	Ademan:  just click the status button
02:17	<hyperactivecrond>	btw what does LTS mean?
02:17	<krazykit>	Ademan: i'm unfamiliar with synaptic, sorry.  don't recall where it'll show, but it will
02:17	<eric>	so there is no way at all that i can view shockwave files then ????
02:17	<krazykit>	hyperactivecrond: long term support
02:17	<Flannel>	hyperactivecrond: Long Term Support
02:17	<bruce89>	mmm
02:17	<mcmahons>	long term support
02:17	<tested2>	Flannel yes it work what im trying to do is disable all other highlighting essentially
02:17	<eyequeue>	hyperactivecrond, long term support
02:17	<hyperactivecrond>	that works
02:17	<DShepherd>	Ademan: you got that?
02:17	<bruce89>	Long Term Support!
02:17	<magic>	Hi guys!
02:17	<Seveas>	LONG TERM SUSPENSE
02:17	<Stormx2>	Hi magic!
02:17	<bruce89>	helop
02:17	<mcmahons>	hahaha
02:17	<LinuxMonkey>	I wonder how long before we overload the servers with download requests when it gets released
02:17	<Ademan>	DShepherd: yeah, thanks, i was installing the package
02:17	<BrianHH>	Can anyone help me figure out where my Palm is installed on my system?  I went through the Palm HOWTO and aside from reminding me to install pilot-xfer, it didn't really illuminate anything for me.
02:17	<bruce89>	wel not that long
02:17	<Hitchhiker>	With SuSE, you have to use outside repositories (which may be flaky) for stuff like video and audio codecs.  Does the Ubuntu team manage this multiverse thing?
02:17	<Stormx2>	Its magic... you know
02:17	<DShepherd>	Ademan: ok
02:18	<Stormx2>	Never beleive its not so...
02:18	<Bung>	i just installed conky with synaptic, but i dont see a .conky or .conkyrc in my ~/ ... so uh, where do i configure the one i see when i run it?
02:18	<Stormx2>	I should sleep
02:18	<alex_>	hello
02:18	<Stormx2>	>.<
02:18	<rixxon>	crimsun: im on dapper rc, E: Package unrar has no installation candidat
02:18	<apokryphos>	Hitchhiker: for some things which are illegal to have in the repositories, yes.
02:18	<bruce89>	me too
02:18	<apokryphos>	rixxon: install unrar-nonfree
02:18	<crimsun>	!info unrar dapper
02:18	<DrewMarin>	you know Im bored of linux gonna go into linux cya guys tommorow
02:18	<Seveas>	!info unrar dapper
02:18	<ubotu>	unrar: (Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version)), section multiverse/utils, is optional. Version: 1:3.5.4-0.1 (dapper), Packaged size: 84 kB, Installed size: 216 kB
02:18	<crimsun>	rixxon: ^^ note the multiverse.
=== HellDragon` is now known as HellDragon
02:18	<rixxon>	crimsun: multiverse enabled
02:19	<Stormx2>	rixxon: have you sudo apt-get update since?
02:19	<apokryphos>	rixxon: my mistake; you just have to enable multiverse.
02:19	<crimsun>	rixxon: dapper or dapper-updates or dapper-backports? :-)
02:19	<rixxon>	E: Package unrar-nonfree has no installation candidate
02:19	<tested2>	Would some one be so kind as to say my nick in 30 seconds want to see if the change I mae worked
02:19	<rixxon>	uhm
02:19	<apokryphos>	rixxon: /msg ubotu repositories
02:19	<hollywoodb>	Bung: I don't remember if its in /usr/share/conky, or /etc/conky*, but there's a file somewhere you can copy to ~/.conkyrc to edit
02:19	<kspath_>	my nick
02:19	<keherman>	Is Ubuntu Live Chat Support in Dapper?
02:19	<crimsun>	rixxon: it's "unrar" in dapper.
02:19	<rackerz>	how come http://cdimage.ubuntulinux.org is gone?
02:19	<Seveas>	keherman, no
02:19	<keherman>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuLiveChatSupport
02:19	<carthik>	tested2, testing
02:19	<Lathiat>	tested2
02:19	<hazart>	tested2: :P
02:19	<bruce89>	tested2
02:19	<Slappy>	tested2
02:19	<Seveas>	rackerz, cdimage.ubuntu.com
02:19	<Stormx2>	tested2
02:19	<Ophiocus>	tested2:
02:19	<tested2>	Thanks, Everyone it worked
02:19	<Nosgoth>	I wish I could wait quietly
02:19	<Hitchhiker>	apokryphos: What do you mean?  Looking on the wiki, multiverse is the "repo of last resort" for Ubuntu, if I'm understanding this right, so w32codec and stuff would probably be there... but who manages Multiverse, is what I'm asking...
02:19	<rackerz>	Yeah that's what I thought.
02:19	<bruce89>	enough timesfor you?
02:19	<DShepherd>	tested2:
02:19	<rixxon>	crimsun: apokryphos told me to install nonfree :P
02:19	<Seveas>	tested2,
02:19	<magic>	Hey I downloaded the iso file from ubunto doenloads, the thing is that the file size is 839.1 MB, so I am unable to burn it on a CD because the CDs are capable of 700MB, did I downloaded a wrong iso?
02:19	<DShepherd>	tested2: hehehe
02:20	<Ubugtu>	tested2
02:20	<Stormx2>	wtf?
02:20	<BadriNarayan>	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ exists
02:20	<moonman>	hows everyone tonight?
02:20	<Stormx2>	Ubugtu said it?
02:20	<bruce89>	i'm sure that's often enouugh
02:20	<Stormx2>	lol
02:20	<DShepherd>	tested2: should we stop now?
02:20	<tested2>	I just set all other highlights to black cause im a genius or an idiot depending on the way you look at it
02:20	<Ubugtu>	Stormx2
02:20	<carthik>	Hitchhiker, multiverse is managed by ubuntu, and no it doesn't have w32codecs and other legally unsound stuff
02:20	<sexcopter8000m>	wow, 911 people in here... more than i've ever seen! 
02:20	<apokryphos>	Hitchhiker: no, things like libdvdcss and w32codecs (which are illegal in many places) are not there, since they're not legal to have.
02:20	<hyperactivecrond>	your mom's box
02:20	<rixxon>	Stormx2: did that now, same error
02:20	<Stormx2>	HE SAID MY NAME!! <3<3<3
02:20	<bruce89>	?
02:20	<Stormx2>	:O
02:20	<hazart>	We're waiting for the dapper to fly off!
02:20	<apokryphos>	sexcopter8000m: more than there's ever been :)
02:20	<dmbt>	dude, whats with the no you can't have a pony thing
02:20	<Stormx2>	That is unnecessy sexual contact!
02:20	<hyperactivecrond>	hey the iso is online. shouldn't it be released then?
02:20	<Stormx2>	Bad bot!
02:20	<dmbt>	on ubuntuforums?
02:20	<Stormx2>	very bad bot!
02:20	<Hitchhiker>	apokryphos: Then how would you play movies or mp3s on Ubuntu?
02:21	<hyperactivecrond>	Stormx2: chill
02:21	<gilianima>	I have recoded some text files that contains french and chinese with 'recode euc-cn..utf8 -f *', it worked well for chinese but not for french, does someone understand that ?
02:21	<bruce89>	blooming heck, soon it wioll be
02:21	<apokryphos>	hyperactivecrond: where?
02:21	<Stormx2>	Ubugtu: Go to my room!
02:21	<Agrajag>	Hitchhiker: by breaking the law, of course
02:21	<hazart>	Anyone who noted the "No you can't have a pony" on the forums? It's gone now :P
02:21	<apokryphos>	Hitchhiker: mp3 codecs are not illegal, and in fact there are free mp3 codecs
02:21	<bruce89>	flp
02:21	<Ubugtu>	with pleasure!
02:21	<bruce89>	sorry - test
02:21	<paul_>	How do you enable dvd playback in ubuntu using totem movie player?
02:21	<hyperactivecrond>	dop'h nvm
02:21	<dmbt>	what was the ubuntofroums pony thing?
02:21	<hyperactivecrond>	d'oh*
02:21	<hyperactivecrond>	sorry
02:21	<bruce89>	i dont know
02:21	<hyperactivecrond>	and also, who'se abusing Ubugtu?
02:21	<Stormx2>	last.fm gives away ponies
02:21	<Stormx2>	^_^
02:22	<crimsun>	Ubugtu's owner is.
02:22	<kspath_>	!tell dmbt about pony
02:22	<Ubugtu>	Stormx2 is abusing me
02:22	<apokryphos>	paul_: /msg ubotu restricted
02:22	<T-CAN>	ubotu tell Hitchhiker about restrictedformats
02:22	<sutur>	i want one (pony)
02:22	<gnomefreak>	lmao
02:22	<Stormx2>	Its not abuse
02:22	<hazart>	This picture was on the front page of the forums : http://www.hadess.net/blog/images/cant-have-a-pony.png
02:22	<bruce89>	i what way
02:22	<Stormx2>	Now lets get out the sun before I melt
02:22	<rackerz>	dmbt, it's a joke from the Fridge :D
02:22	<Hitchhiker>	apokryphos: Of course... and frankly I'm not concerned about the FBI raiding me over libdvdcss, but I'm just waiting on Dapper to try my hand at Ubuntu, and I'm wondering what Ubuntu's procedure for that stuff is
02:22	<guano>	hyperactivecrond where did you see the iso?
02:22	<dmbt>	oh
02:22	<bruce89>	out the moon more like
02:22	<rackerz>	I don't think he really saw the iso
02:22	<ompaul>	crimsun, that is not funny but it is true :-) well done, you did some really good stuff there
02:22	<hyperactivecrond>	guano: false alarm.
02:22	<Stormx2>	You see, Ubugtu, I never had a childhood
02:22	<Hitchhiker>	Ah, here we are, thanks for the URL :)
02:22	<hyperactivecrond>	TO Clarify:
02:22	<hazart>	What exactly is the fridge? Some core community og COOL developers?
02:22	<T-CAN>	NP
02:22	<YoManWazap>	dmbt I guess cause time is over and the release in not yet out!!
02:22	<ompaul>	crimsun, that was two statements :-)
02:22	<apokryphos>	Hitchhiker: all you should ever need, really, is the normal repositories (with multiverse etc), and Seveas' repository. See /msg ubotu seveas
02:22	<T-CAN>	its a pretty simple process
02:23	<bruce89>	i doubtthe FBI will raid you
02:23	<BadriNarayan>	thanks for the link, hyperactivecrond
02:23	<crimsun>	ompaul: no idea what you're referring to :-)
02:23	<paul_>	./msg unbuntu restricted
02:23	<guano>	hyperactivecrond :( i've been searching for a "misplaced" final iso ;)
02:23	<BadriNarayan>	why do you not want it to be public though?
02:23	<Hitchhiker>	Thanks
02:23	<ompaul>	paul_, without the .
02:23	<hyperactivecrond>	there is NO iso yet!
02:23	<T-CAN>	so whats the next release gunna be? Crappy Camel?
02:23	<rixxon>	on dapper, multiverse enabled, apt-get updated, unrar not found. suggestions? :)
02:23	<hyperactivecrond>	T-CAN: don't hate.
02:23	<bruce89>	We're all just tiny multiple bleeps of laser traveling to/from any two energy sources, think about it, I did and I thought, shouldn't that be travelling?
02:23	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell paul_ -about restricted
02:23	<hyperactivecrond>	T-CAN: edgy eft
02:23	<apokryphos>	T-CAN: Edgy Eft

02:23	<paul_>	Yea please do
02:24	<T-CAN>	nice
02:24	<Stormx2>	I wanted Perky Penguin :(
02:24	<Hitchhiker>	rixxon: Try looking for just 'rar', perhaps?
02:24	<T-CAN>	haha
02:24	<hyperactivecrond>	!tell paul_ about restricted
02:24	<Belathor>	After that they should do Prancing Pony, so we can have are ponies!
02:24	<bruce89>	oh welll edgy+1 might be perky
02:24	<gnomefreak>	paul_: i already did
02:24	<kspath_>	Stormx2: that will take several years
02:24	<Stormx2>	I hope so
02:24	<hyperactivecrond>	who is getting ubugtu to be creepy?
02:24	<Seveas>	edgy+1 will be furry
02:24	<rixxon>	Hitchhiker: nothing found

02:24	<hyperactivecrond>	whatever
02:24	<Ophiocus>	Stormx2: you should have realised by now that they follow an alphabetic order?
02:24	<Belathor>	:D
02:24	<bruce89>	tested2
02:24	<hazart>	Do somebody have a patch to make the taskbar fully transparent? Right now mine has some non translucent corners around the window list.

02:25	<gnomefreak>	Hitchhiker: a small newt
02:25	<sutur>	me i guess
02:25	<Stormx2>	Ophiocus: Are you using dvorak or something?
02:25	<Flannel>	Nosgoth: it's more than just them 'releasing' it.   They have to finish it and upload, and stuff.
02:25	<Hitchhiker>	Ah, thanks
02:25	<gnomefreak>	very small
02:25	<mock_turtle>	hi
02:25	<crimsun>	hyperactivecrond: how what?

02:26	<Stormx2>	Ophiocus: abuh?
02:26	<bruce89>	no
02:26	<gnomefreak>	gumpish: its not gonna be nor ever was alphabetical
02:26	<LinuxMonkey>	Flannel you know they allready have it uploaded for a day or so, they just got to sync it first
02:26	<rixxon>	don't tell me unability to extract a rar archive will be the reason i switch back to windows :(
02:26	<jrasith>	hello all

02:26	<Harold_P>	rixxon, get unrar
02:26	<rixxon>	Harold_P: that's the problem
02:26	<dmbt>	rixxon: unrar
02:26	<Hitchhiker>	So it's Gory Gabon after Edgy Eft? :)
02:26	<gnomefreak>	l_r: its ready just not final release
02:26	<bruce89>	could be
02:26	<DShepherd>	rixxon: heheh
02:26	<r0xz>	l_r: no, read toppic
02:26	<guano>	?? there are dapper iso's on isohunt.com ... 11 hours old...
02:26	<Harold_P>	you can't apt-get install unrar, rixxon?
02:26	<megabyte405>	rixxon: unrar-free , or unrar-nonfree if you need support for the latest rar version
02:26	<crimsun>	Hitchhiker: no, hanged hitchhiker
02:26	<Stormx2>	Amazing Antalope
02:26	<hyperactivecrond>	guano: warez. haxx.
02:27	<Hitchhiker>	haha
02:27	<bruce89>	daily disk i think
02:27	<rixxon>	megabyte405: unrar-free can't extract splitted archive, no?
02:27	<rackerz>	warez rulezzz
02:27	<fiendskull9>	!mp3
02:27	<ubotu>	I guess mp3 is a patented format; to enable mp3 capability see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
02:27	<gnomefreak>	gumpish: theres dapper isos on ubuntu.com sites too
02:27	<YoManWazap>	l_r no the they keep the pony hiding
02:27	<hyperactivecrond>	Creepy Channelusers
02:27	<megabyte405>	rixxon: no clue, I don't really use rar
02:27	<apokryphos>	rackerz: no warez talk in here please :)
02:27	<T-CAN>	hahaha
02:27	<guano>	they're hosted from torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/announce
02:27	<hyperactivecrond>	!tell fiendskull9 about msgthebot
02:27	<apokryphos>	rixxon: what's the problem?
02:27	<gumpish>	someone told me gullible isn't in the dictionary
02:27	<bruce89>	yikes whats all the warez all about now, I thought ubuntu negates the "need" for i
02:27	<DShepherd>	rixxon: do you have the multiverse repository in your source list?
02:27	<jrasith>	any idea on what time the bit torrents will be up?
02:27	<Hitchhiker>	Could one of the gui archive managers read rar, perhaps?
02:27	<FliesLikeABrick>	rixxon whatever rar utility is in apt can do split archives, I've done it many times
02:27	<apokryphos>	jrasith: at release time.
02:27	<DShepherd>	!dapper
02:27	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)

02:27	<rixxon>	unrar-free is the only thing apt-get/synaptic finds, i'll try it
02:28	<jrasith>	ohh!, thanks ubotu
02:28	<T-CAN>	download of drake will be availible via bit torrent??
02:28	<apokryphos>	rixxon: are you on dapper?
02:28	<rixxon>	apokryphos: yes
02:28	<T-CAN>	there is a god!
02:28	<apokryphos>	rixxon: install "unrar"
02:28	<_kadaj_3>	hei hei

02:28	<_kadaj_3>	ubuntu will be release
02:28	<rixxon>	apokryphos: apt-get doesn't find 'unrar'
02:28	<bruce89>	multiverse?
02:28	<cdubya>	heh, think I'll wait till after the weekend perhaps to try dapper....maybe the flood gates will have subsided......besides, it'll give me time to make sure it's not breaking you all's stuff first...... :D
02:28	<DShepherd>	rixxon you need to have the multiverse repo enabled before you will see unrar in synaptic
02:28	<apokryphos>	rixxon: then you don't have multiverse enabled
02:28	<FliesLikeABrick>	yes T-CAN and the bittorrent release will be quite quick, many people seed releases on fast servers for it

02:40	<crywolf_3>	yeah
02:40	<bruce89>	also going whhahhwha once certainly doesn't call for swearing
02:40	<DShepherd>	caldo: up where?
02:40	<matallo>	sorry apokryphos i'm so excited
02:40	<caldo>	not, just a little joke
02:40	<crywolf_3>	 i download it 3 days ago
02:40	<caldo>	heh
02:40	<Limen>	were can I download the release when it arrives?
02:40	<andrejkw>	I am so impatient for Dapper.
02:40	<ekelund>	I will leave this channel to much join and part for me this client sounds all the time
02:40	<matallo>	i can't control
02:40	<MTecknology>	!COC
02:40	<ubotu>	[coc]  the Ubuntu Code of Conduct, which we ask all Ubuntu users to follow. You can find the Code of Conduct at http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct/
02:40	<hastesaver>	arun, it should be setup by itself, if you're having problems, look at the link given by "/msg ubotu sound"
02:40	<Hitchhiker>	http://www.ubuntu.com/download
02:40	<FliesLikeABrick>	Limen look at the ubuntu website after it is released and click on download, just like you normally would
02:40	<rixxon>	carthik: i did 'sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list', :%s/universe$/universe multiverse/g, and :wq
02:40	<Limen>	thx
02:40	<rixxon>	carthik: E: Package unrar has no installation candidate
02:41	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: enable multiverse
02:41	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: read the message before :P
02:41	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: no the ones with the word backport in them
02:41	<blurtblurt>	Is there a page describing the -server kernels?
02:41	<medgno>	rixxon, did you do a sudo apt-get update?
02:41	<sutur>	in austria its 02:41 how much longer shall i wait?
02:41	<crywolf_3>	i did everything to install the wm codec to playback dvd
02:42	<matallo>	imagine they who have to ftp the files to the servers
02:42	<megabyte405>	rixxon: there is no package named unrar.  Pick either unrar-free or unrar-nonfree
02:42	<crywolf_3>	 dut still not working
02:42	<gnomefreak>	blurtblurt: server kernels are same as non server kernels
02:42	<matallo>	they must feel like GOD
02:42	<megabyte405>	rixxon: search synaptic for info
02:42	<DShepherd>	rixxon: did you check my sourcelist at pastebin? your sourcelist should look like that
02:42	<rixxon>	medgno: thank you, forgot that *doh*
02:42	<megabyte405>	rixxon: search for "rar"
02:42	<DShepherd>	rixxon: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14938 <-- here it is again
02:42	<FliesLikeABrick>	matallo the channel is busy enough right now, please stick to the topic
02:42	<Jeeves_>	gnomefreak: In dapper they aren't. AFAIS
02:42	<carthik>	rixxon, after you change sources.list it is neccessary to do an $sudo apt-get update
02:42	<crimsun>	gnomefreak: (not precisely. different elevator algorithm, preempt is disabled, memory support is larger, etc.)
02:42	<caldo>	where would the torrent normally be?
02:42	<medgno>	blurtblurt, except that server kernels are tuned better for servers and don't have the non-free drivers
02:42	<T-CAN>	in fstab, what should i set umask to to give me read/write/execute permissions on a partion ??
02:42	<caldo>	on /download ?
02:42	<Flannel>	Jeeves_: I believe they are.
02:42	<rixxon>	carthik: yea i did, and it works now. thank you!
02:42	<YoManWazap>	from the ubuntu forums: they decided to open the dapper drake section a little early
02:42	<FliesLikeABrick>	T-CAN a normal ext3 filesystem on that partition?
02:42	<rackerz>	does anyone think Dapper will be out in 30 mins? If not I'm going to go to bed.
02:42	<blurtblurt>	medgno: I just want a list of differences, including a summary of how they are tuned
02:42	<T-CAN>	vfat
02:42	<carthik>	rixxon, my pleasure
02:42	<FliesLikeABrick>	rackerz go to bed
02:42	<bruce89>	edgy dont you mean
02:43	<hyperactivecrond>	that was for you Rackerz
02:43	<Jeeves_>	Flannel: I read somewhere that Dapper has seperate server kernels
02:43	<caldo>	YoManWazap i already did that joke heh
02:43	<DShepherd>	T-CAN: 0222
02:43	<rackerz>	lol :D
02:43	<nbx909>	rackerz expect it in 8 hours
02:43	<T-CAN>	alright, thanks
02:43	<Godfather>	rackerz, hahaha me too
02:43	<rackerz>	i'll get up in 8 hours
02:43	<BadriNarayan>	or 12 hours, whichever is later
02:43	<bruce89>	or 8-16
02:43	<DShepherd>	T-CAN: its is ntfs? or vfat?
02:43	<caldo>	i'm already up
02:43	<nbx909>	yeah 8-16
02:43	<tommy>	does someone know if the multimedia streams in broswers are correctly played by default in dapper ?
02:43	<T-CAN>	vfat
02:43	<caldo>	it IS exciting
02:43	<FliesLikeABrick>	DShepherd he said vfat
02:43	<bruce89>	it's anyones gues
02:43	<DShepherd>	FliesLikeABrick: ok
02:43	<rackerz>	Right see you guys in 8 hours!
02:43	<tommy>	I had a lot of problems in breezy

02:43	<gnomefreak>	ah ok ty crimsun
02:43	<cdubya>	any php/mysql folks in here.....I know it's a bit off-topic, but I can't get anyone to even answer me on #php......and I've tried #mysql before as well with little luck.....
02:43	<Flannel>	tommy: they won't be played by default, since you have to install the codecs, etc.
02:44	<Flannel>	cdubya: #ubuntu-offtopic for it ;)
02:44	<FliesLikeABrick>	cdubya you do not want to ask here, especially because it is this busy right now.
02:44	<matallo>	how will the command be to install lamp?
02:44	<hyperactivecrond>	don't let the doorknob hit ya where the good lord split ya...
02:44	<Jeeves_>	cdubya: Kinda busy here for non-topic questions
02:44	<matallo>	sudo aptitude install lamp?
02:44	<Flannel>	!tell matallo about lamp
02:44	<Dimitris>	Any particular torrent site that will host dapper?
02:44	<caldo>	i think its an option when you stuff the cd in
02:44	<bruce89>	lots
02:44	<caldo>	at least that was the screenshot i saw
02:44	<tommy>	Flannel, I have installed the codecs in breezy but even with this I still had a lot of problems
02:44	<muszek>	Dimitris: thepiratebay.org :)

02:45	<Jeeves_>	Dimitris: I will. :)
02:45	<FliesLikeABrick>	Dimitris I will be hosting a seed for the torrent on 4 of my 100mbit servers across the USA
02:45	<Dimitris>	hyperactivecrond :-D Nice!!!

02:45	<hyperactivecrond>	me++
02:45	<hyperactivecrond>	Dimitris, can i /msg you
02:45	<hou5ton>	I have changed the repositories to dapper and upgraded ... and now gnome won't come up and the sound doesn't work .... any suggestions?
02:45	<Dimitris>	sure
02:45	<matallo>	torrent will be faster than ftp or http won't it?
02:45	<FliesLikeABrick>	hou5ton #ubuntu+1 for dapper help
02:46	<bruce89>	probalbyt
02:46	<medgno>	hou5ton, did you 'upgrade' or 'dist-upgrade'?
02:46	<jrasith>	I would assume so
02:46	<apokryphos>	matallo: definitely, yes.
02:46	<FliesLikeABrick>	yes matallo  it will be a lot faster
02:46	<matallo>	thx
02:46	<caldo>	i just hope there won't be vmware problems, i need that thing to work
02:46	<[zero] >	is this new version out yet?
02:46	<hou5ton>	medgno:  don't really know
02:46	<FliesLikeABrick>	caldo vmware works fine on dapper
02:46	<bruce89>	no
02:46	<FliesLikeABrick>	[zero]  /topic
02:46	<apokryphos>	[zero] : /topic
02:46	<medgno>	hou5ton, or if you used synaptic, did you select the 'smart upgrade'?
02:46	<[zero] >	oh yeh hehe
02:46	<[zero] >	sozz
02:46	<crimsun>	caldo: it's included in multiverse.
02:46	<caldo>	oh really
02:46	<muszek>	matallo: I got breezy with full speed (2mbps) right after it came out... it got slower at the very end, though.
02:46	<Jack_Smirnoff>	Hello all.  I would like to know the proper way to make a hardware change (Video card) after Ubuntu is installed
02:46	<caldo>	thats awesome
02:46	<caldo>	save me alot of trouble
02:46	<bruce89>	wow, a lot of stroppy people here
02:46	<Hitchhiker>	How about dapper and Xen?
02:46	<muszek>	matallo: I was getting it via http
02:47	<grimboy>	I want a pony!
02:47	<hou5ton>	medgno:  well ... I just changed all the repo's where it said "breezy" to "dapper" ... was that a bad thing?
02:47	<caldo>	how about dapper and IIS?
02:47	<caldo>	;-)
02:47	<hyperactivecrond>	!tell grimboy about ponie
02:47	<bruce89>	yes
02:47	<crimsun>	!info vmware-player dapper
02:47	<crimsun>	bah, it hasn't been updated yet
02:47	<caldo>	!info vmware-server dapper
02:47	<medgno>	hou5ton, that's how you're supposed to do it. But what did you do after changing the repos?
02:47	<bruce89>	no its not
02:47	<caldo>	doh!
02:47	<r4zz>	FliesLikeABrick, when do you expect to be starting the torrent?
02:47	<FliesLikeABrick>	r4zz as soon as it is released
02:47	<[zero] >	I got a question, If i duel boot ubuntu on this pc and have a seperate harddrive for music and that will i be able to read and write to the seperate harddrive from both ubuntu and xp??
02:47	<matallo>	afaik the more people the faster -->btorrent the more people the slower -->	http
02:47	<bruce89>	gksu "update-manager -d"
02:47	<FliesLikeABrick>	r4zz I will be leaving my 100mbit seeds online for the next week or two
02:47	<hou5ton>	medgno:  well .. I don't recall doing a "smart" upgrade
02:48	<Flannel>	bruce89: gksudo not gksu
02:48	<bruce89>	if it's Fat, yes
02:48	<DShepherd>	[zero] : if it vfat.. yes
02:48	<Jack_Smirnoff>	only if is running fat32 partition
02:48	<nosklo>	can I downoad dapper? please please please please please
02:48	<grimboy>	Is this some kind of discrimination against anyone not in america?
02:48	<bruce89>	is it gksudo
02:48	<FliesLikeABrick>	nosklo  /topic
02:48	<medgno>	hou5ton, maybe try running the command 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' in a terminal and see what it says
02:48	<rixxon>	what do i need to play xvid in totem?
02:48	<r4zz>	FliesLikeABrick, will you be getting it at the same time as the mirrors or will you have to get it off one of them?
02:48	<caldo>	damn, the torrent is only going to be dvd?
02:48	<FliesLikeABrick>	r4zz I will be getting it from the torrent initially
02:48	<caldo>	i knew i should have bought that burner
02:48	<[zero] >	ok thankx everyone that answered it shall be done :D
02:48	<FliesLikeABrick>	no caldo the torrent will be all of the release images
02:49	<caldo>	sweet
02:49	<grimboy>	It is. First random wars, now small delays.
02:49	<bruce89>	but the topic is Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise) | Release Parties! https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseParties
02:49	<hou5ton>	medgno:  that's what I did before ... and I just did it again and it indicates I'm good
02:49	<r4zz>	FliesLikeABrick,  oh I get it now, I thought you were in charge of the official torrent :P
02:49	<Dimitris>	News: Pirate Bay torrent site down after Swedish National Criminal Police search warrant
02:49	<crywolf_3>	not getting any where
02:49	<bruce89>	we now
02:49	<bruce89>	know
02:49	<FliesLikeABrick>	no r4zz I just put up a bunch of fast mirrors on servers I own to help speed the torrent up a lot
=== poningru_ is now known as poningru
02:49	<bruce89>	or i know
02:49	<matallo>	lol Dimitris
02:49	<medgno>	hou5ton, okay, then I'm not sure. You did everything right as far as I know.
02:49	<FliesLikeABrick>	Dimitris  bruce89  pasting please
02:50	<r4zz>	that's pretty cool :)
02:50	<FliesLikeABrick>	stop pasting*
02:50	<medgno>	if you haven't rebooted, you could try that
02:50	<bruce89>	am i
02:50	<hyperactivecrond>	!ponie
02:50	<ubotu>	ponie is, like, totally, whinny, http://fridge.ubuntu.com/files/no-pony-for-you.jpg
02:50	<bruce89>	am i?
02:50	<bruce89>	oops
02:50	<FliesLikeABrick>	bruce89 we know what the topic says, we don't need you to paste it for us ;)
02:50	<rpedro>	!joystick
02:50	<ubotu>	have a look at all these packages "joystick" - Testing and calibration tools "jscalibrator" - GTK Joystick Calibrator "jslaunch" - Joystick button shell command execution/shutdown tool
02:51	<bruce89>	but then when people say stuff about dapper you tell them to keep on topic, but the topic is dapper
=== halibut is now known as halobut
02:51	<Flannel>	bruce89: only by resignation.
02:51	<JohnP789>	"time sudo hdparm /dev/hdc" takes over a minute to complete.  I don't see anything in the logs to suggest what's wrong.  Any ideas?
02:51	<FliesLikeABrick>	bruce89 when people ask "when will dapper be out?!?" we point them to the topic rather than telling them over and over
02:52	<JohnP789>	/dev/hdc is an NEC DVD burner.
02:52	<bruce89>	i see
02:52	<matallo>	there's no rss for teh fridge?
02:52	<bruce89>	it is very annoying i supose
02:52	<bruce89>	yes there is
02:52	<matallo>	oh ye
02:52	<matallo>	sorry
02:52	<JohnP789>	It's instantaneous with no media in the drive.
02:53	<FliesLikeABrick>	JohnP789 then it is likely reading data from the drive
02:53	<xumbi>	anyone know what server(s) will have dapper first?
02:53	<gnomefreak>	xumbi: no but you will be informed
02:54	<nosklo>	xumbi, people are suggesting microsoft.com
02:54	<gnomefreak>	if im still up ;)
02:54	<jrasith>	lol, microsoft.com
02:54	<AngryElf>	how can i get the version of a package installed using apt-get?
02:54	<tommy>	i d like to know if there will be a version that fits on a cd, or is it gonna be available only on dvd ?
02:54	<medgno>	there will be cd images
02:54	<fortgate>	AngryElf, apt-cache policy <packagename>
02:54	<troy_s>	angry:  have you tried apt-cache?
02:54	<grimboy>	man
02:54	<AngryElf>	or ,whatever program......just not synaptic
02:54	<Flannel>	AngryElf: apt-cache show [package]  or showpkg
02:54	<gnomefreak>	AngryElf: what package?
02:54	<FliesLikeABrick>	xumbi your best bet (if you're looking for a CD image) is to get it from the torrents
02:54	<ggilbert>	tommy, it will fit on a cd
02:54	<xumbi>	nolsko: awesome, I'll watch that ;)
02:55	<ablyss>	i need to report a bug.. tail -c in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Dapper doesn't work
02:55	<tommy>	ggilbert, thanks
02:55	<Ophiocus>	AngryElf: in synaptic search in your installed tab for a description
02:55	<bruce89>	tired, bye
02:55	<FliesLikeABrick>	ablyss  if you need help with dapper between now and tomorrow, go to #ubuntu+1
02:55	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell ablyss about bug
02:55	<hou5ton>	I've downloaded the Dapper RC and burned the ISO, twice ... but it won't install
02:55	<Hitchhiker>	How well does Ubuntu upgrade between versions?  With SuSE, it's been hit or miss, and mostly miss...
02:55	<ablyss>	thanks
02:55	<FliesLikeABrick>	Hitchhiker flawlessly
02:55	<gnomefreak>	!upgrade
02:55	<ubotu>	upgrade is probably Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
02:55	<FliesLikeABrick>	Hitchhiker it is somethign tested very carefully
02:55	<ggilbert>	Hitchhiker: It does a dandy job upgrading
02:55	<FliesLikeABrick>	something*
02:55	<xumbi>	anyone know what the title will be?  e.g. ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso  I'm trying to write a script to download it as soon as it's released :)
02:55	<AngryElf>	i could imagine that more than one version gets cached, with that in mind, apt-cache will show the version of the package that's installed, yes?
02:56	<FliesLikeABrick>	hou5ton you may want to wait and re-download the actual stable release tomorrow
02:56	<Hitchhiker>	Sweet
02:56	<BadriNarayan>	Can I ask a question about NetworkManager in ubuntu here?
02:56	<Flannel>	Hitchhiker: it upgrades fine, there are some leftover packages you sometimes have to remove afterwards, but they're not anything that's going to explode.
02:56	<gnomefreak>	xumbi: 5.10 was released in oct 2005
02:56	<FliesLikeABrick>	gnomefreak he was using that as an example
02:56	<FliesLikeABrick>	xumbi just check it by hand, scripts will just load the servers un-necessarily
02:56	<hou5ton>	FliesLikeABrick::  ya .. at this point ... good idea
02:56	<xumbi>	gnomefreak: yes I know, I was just using that as an example
02:56	<thenetduck>	hey i thought they said 0:00 GMT for Dapper release is that correct?
02:56	<FliesLikeABrick>	thenetduck read the topic /topic
02:56	<fortgate>	AngryElf, apt-cache policy <pkg>	      will show you the currently installed version, and the available versions
02:56	<Kyral>	look at the topic...
02:56	<Bilford>	it's 00:56
02:56	<xumbi>	FliesLikeABrick: good point
02:56	<guano>	xumbi i think it would look something like dapper-dvd-i386.iso
02:56	<Hitchhiker>	Flannel: Sweet... SuSE has often caused things like network to stop working at boot when doing upgrades...
02:57	<gnomefreak>	xumbi: ubuntu-6.06-alternative-1386.iso  afaik
02:57	<AngryElf>	fortgate, thanx
02:57	<FliesLikeABrick>	I highly reccomend downloading the images via torrent rather than loading the webservers once dapper is released
02:57	<FliesLikeABrick>	it will be much faster
02:57	<gnomefreak>	thenetduck: no it was not correct
02:57	<fortgate>	OMG irc channels come with topics now?  :)
02:57	<thenetduck>	gosh darn it

02:58	<FliesLikeABrick>	Bilford no
02:58	<Bilford>	ty
02:58	<gnomefreak>	Bilford: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
02:58	<Bilford>	ok
02:58	<ggilbert>	Barring any last minute packages, which would just be happily upgraded anyways :)

03:07	<bsdfox>	you're upset because ubuntu doesn't have KDE?
03:07	<baseman_>	or he could just "sudo apt-get install kubuntu"

03:14	<FliesLikeABrick>	baseman_ can you give me more information about what isn't working, rather than just saying it is broken?
03:14	<edvinasMD5>	ty
03:14	<baseman_>	absolutely.  I am trying to use my orinoco gold wifi card.
03:14	<bur[n] er>	DShepherd: that's only half true.. .you can run opera widgets in gnome
03:14	<baseman_>	It connects to the accesspoint, as evidenced by the lights on the card, iwconfig, and network manager
03:14	<DShepherd>	bur[n] er: ok kool
03:14	<pepinito>	great!
03:14	<cluehammer>	there will always be women in rubber flirting with me
03:14	<baseman_>	It also requests an IP address via DHCP according to my DHCP server
03:15	<cluehammer>	guess the quote!
03:15	<baseman_>	's logs
03:15	<kbrooks>	Sgeo: people want to see artwork
03:15	<pepinito>	now i have a trash on my desktop
03:15	<baseman_>	and the DHCP server throws one back
03:15	<pepinito>	thanks!
03:15	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell cluehammer about offtopic
03:15	<h3h_timo>	baseman_, ive had probems with dhcp and dapper too.. i get addresses and everything... it just wont connect
03:15	<cluehammer>	lol i gotcha
03:15	<baseman_>	ubuntu sets the interface's IP to the one it is given, according to ifconfig and "Connection Properties"
03:15	<baseman_>	...for about half a second
03:15	<baseman_>	then back to no ip address and the default ipv6 one.
03:16	<semq>	does anyone know how to fully uninstall cedega?

03:17	<cluehammer>	cholesterol free
03:17	<grimboy>	I found xfce to not have enough stuff.

03:21	<FliesLikeABrick>	baseman_ what do you have your lease time set to?
03:21	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: i mean where is it on my computer, how do i star tit
03:21	<InvisiblePinkUni>	can the topic be set to "countdown" the time....

03:21	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: under totem in the menu
03:21	<FliesLikeABrick>	yes baseman_ on the server
03:21	<FliesLikeABrick>	InvisiblePinkUni there is not an exact time set
03:21	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: what menu? :/
03:21	<edvinasMD5>	how can I be root on my desktop, not in terminal?
03:21	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: if you didnt already type killall gnome-panel
03:21	<dmbt>	*people*: dapper will be ready when its *ready* be patient
03:21	<Bladesonfire>	!root
03:21	<ubotu>	Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
03:22	<grimboy>	rixxon: now you can't use the gstreamer backend
03:22	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: its under multimedia
03:22	<chapium>	semq, you can get a .deb of the latest xfce right from the xfce website i think
03:22	<semq>	how can i update my xfce version gnomefreak?
03:22	<Bladesonfire>	edvinasMD5, that link was for you ;)
03:22	<Flannel>	edvinasMD5: gksudo nautilus will make a nautilus window with root privledges

03:22	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: i don't have a multimedia menu
03:22	<chapium>	semq, there is also an installer that will compile it for you
03:22	<gnomefreak>	semq: upgrade to dapper
03:22	<semq>	ty chapium
03:22	<FliesLikeABrick>	InvisiblePinkUni we can see ;)
03:22	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: sound
03:22	<semq>	is dapper a beta version?
03:22	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: only normal totem is there
03:22	<Tweek888>	Hello, I'm having some trouble setting up nvidia-glx on dapper
03:22	<edvinasMD5>	well i want to edit gdesklets source
03:22	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: no its not
03:22	<grimboy>	It is normal totem
03:22	<FliesLikeABrick>	semq only for the next 24h or less.  it will be available as stable tomorrow
03:22	<InvisiblePinkUni>	FliesLikeABrick: we must stop users from leaving.... get 1000 users.... ;)
03:23	<semq>	great ;)
03:23	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: totem-xine and totem can not live on same system with apt
03:23	<rixxon>	grimboy: but normal totem can't play xvid for me?
03:23	<Flannel>	edvinasMD5: you'll need to download the source then, from the repositories
03:23	<ryno>	I have a usb device that works fine when it's coldplugged but when I turn it off and then turn it back on the module doesn't come up anymore. Any idea how I can figure out why and how to fix it?
03:23	<baseman_>	ugh why is this
03:23	<FliesLikeABrick>	gnomefreak is dapper technically considered beta right now or something more since it is past RC?
03:23	<chapium>	dapper was a horrible upgrade for me, it enticed me to mess with things i shouldn't.  Like xgl.  Now my gdm is screwed :(
03:23	<grimboy>	rixxon: Use gxine then
03:23	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: if you install totem-xine than the totem you see is it
03:23	<gnomefreak>	FliesLikeABrick: rc
03:23	<glanz>	?????
03:23	<FliesLikeABrick>	thanks gnomefreak, just a technicality
03:23	<DShepherd>	chapium: heheeh
03:23	<edvinasMD5>	there is an option, view source, but only read only, i think i could edit it, if i would be root
03:23	<kspath_>	 /ignore chapium
03:23	<gnomefreak>	FliesLikeABrick: depends for people that have it?
03:23	<chapium>	but thats really my own fault, not dappers directly
03:24	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: yea but totem fails to play xvid :p
03:24	<FliesLikeABrick>	yeah gnomefreak I was referring to the status of the available version
03:24	<gnomefreak>	FliesLikeABrick: ive been on dapper stable for over 12 hours
03:24	<FliesLikeABrick>	as have I gnomefreak
03:24	<Flannel>	edvinasMD5: so, close it, then gksudo gdesklets
03:24	<gnomefreak>	FliesLikeABrick: rc
03:24	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: did you install the xine codecs?
03:24	<DShepherd>	rixxon: i think you need one of the gstreamer packages,, bad or the ugly.. i think, i;m not sure
=== subsinker is now known as sub|off
03:25	<rixxon>	gnomefreak: 'sudo apt-get install totem-xine' - gonna try gxine now anyway
03:25	<nosklo>	ryno, which usb device is that?
03:25	<edvinasMD5>	md5@vodka:~$ gksudo gdesklets
03:25	<edvinasMD5>	You must NOT run gDesklets as super user (root).
03:25	<grimboy>	rixxon: That's not a codec that's a backend
03:25	<gnomefreak>	edvinasMD5: right click gnome panel you should beable to add them there
03:26	<rixxon>	so what do i apt-get :)
03:26	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: there are xine codecs to play certain files
03:26	<edvinasMD5>	i can add them, but i can't edit them :)
03:26	<jmworx>	I want to install Dapper now. What should I use (rc/beta/whatever)?
03:26	<rixxon>	it did install some libxine or something
03:26	<glanz>	I got the codecs frol PLF then use only xine... I'm on Xubuntu-- already up2date
03:26	<ryno>	nosklo: It's m audio quattro sound card. I know I was able to get the modules to come back online after power down in debian.
03:26	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell rixxon about restricted
03:26	<kbrooks>	jmworx: rc, then upgrade

03:27	<gnomefreak>	JoeyB2: create it when you mannully partitions it
03:28	<Sakkath>	How can I RAID two firewire extrenal HDDs?
03:28	<grimboy>	rixxon: If you do that you'll have to reinstall totem-gstreamer as those are gstreamer codecs
03:28	<rixxon>	DShepherd: why are they called ugly and bad
03:28	<FliesLikeABrick>	Sakkath at install time or afterwards?
03:28	<edvinasMD5>	is it possible to get in the Ubuntu team?

03:30	<Sakkath>	FliesLikeABrick: but it won't make a difference if it's different than the root?
03:30	<DShepherd>	rixxon: oh :-(
03:30	<grimboy>	rixxon: Make sure when you play it the player is using the gstreamer backend
03:30	<openback>	Knorrie: would smb be the same? I have that, but not smbd
03:30	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: please get the xine codecs off the site ubotu gave you

03:32	<suspekt>	wait what whas that? you can't upgrade from RC to full?
03:33	<thomag>	I might have heard it was sudo apt-get something.

03:34	<mcmahons>	Flannel: ne way of telling
03:34	<bkh>	So is there a picture of the Dapper Drake? :)
03:34	<mcmahons>	openback: sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
03:34	<FliesLikeABrick>	openback if there are errors check in /var/log for samba errors and /var/log/syslog
03:34	<DShepherd>	bkh:  lost
03:34	<kbrooks>	bkh: LOL. no
03:34	<Warbo>	Does anyone know why totem might lose sound? (would "/dev/dsp in use" be the problem? I've stopped any process that might be using it)

03:38	<openback>	mcmahons: well good point, I see quite a few smb* programs, but no smbd or nmbd. Which package am I missing then?
03:38	<rixxon>	!tell T-CAN about restricted
03:38	<T-CAN>	i havent found any packages in synaptec
03:38	<DShepherd>	rixxon: what was the solution?
03:38	<jrsims>	hey, looks like I deleted my home directory and all my settings files for gnome.
03:38	<jmworx>	FliesLikeABrick: Oops, thanks
03:38	<poimen>	suspekt : dist-upgrade is when u are using another number of relese like if yopuwere using breezy (5.10 ) and want to go to dapper (6.06)
03:38	<jrsims>	How do I create a new gnome profile
03:38	<jrsims>	?
03:38	<rixxon>	DShepherd: i don't quite know, installed _all_ packages mentioned for ubuntu dapper :D
03:38	<shane_>	t-can - mplayer

03:39	<T-CAN>	ya, i have universe and multiverse enabled
=== kevinjsmith is now known as turing
03:39	<T-CAN>	i just need to know which packages to get
03:39	<T-CAN>	if there are any
03:39	<jrsims>	Can anyone tell me how to create a new Gnome profile after I accidentally killed my home directory?
=== turing is now known as WoodwardAve
03:39	<pianoboy3333>	What command will give me all the packages that I can update, but just a list, not apt-get update
03:40	<Warbo>	T-CAN: Just get anything beginning with "gstreamer" and you should be OK
03:40	<rixxon>	T-CAN: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats#head-16ea04e7e1ecd06555912ba3f470b56563cbd85d
03:40	<todayisagift>	can you think of anything else other than VNC?
03:40	<bkh>	VNC is the standard way of getting remote desktops
03:40	<grimboy>	T-CAN: sudo apt-get install gstreamer*
03:41	<bkh>	Both in the windows world and linux
03:41	<Healot>	OS independent i would say
03:41	<todayisagift>	ok then ubuntu is what version of linux (x...)
03:41	<jrsims>	Hello!! Can anyone tell me how to create a new Gnome profile after I accidentally killed my home directory?
03:41	<mcmahons>	pianoboy3333: there'll be a switch for apt-get update, do a man apt
03:41	<DShepherd>	T-CAN: use synpatic and install gstreamer0.10 stuff
03:41	<Warbo>	pianoboy3333: Dunno. If you use the clean option then --download-only you would know that everything in /var/cache/apt/archives was upgradable
03:42	<Warbo>	jrsims: Usually just logging in again will do it (after copying anything from /etc/skel to your new home)
03:42	<_tmx_dt2>	hey can any1 help me mount my ntfs primary hard drive that i can't find ever since I BSOD safe mode or not.  thanks
03:42	<delire>	888 nicks. nize
03:42	<matthew>	hi
03:43	<Tweek888>	Has anyone not been able to get nvidia drivers working properly on dapper?
03:43	<jrsims>	Warbo: well, I will enter gnome from the login screen, but then all I get is a screen with my mouse pointer on it
03:43	<matthew>	how do i install apps and programs on gnome?
03:43	<todayisagift>	what version of linux is ubuntu?
03:43	<jrsims>	Warbo: no menu bars or anything
03:43	<Harold_P>	there is no version of linux..
03:43	<Harold_P>	just kernel version, really
03:43	<jrsims>	Warbo: so I was thinking I probably killed all my gnome settings in the home directory.
03:43	<NoUse>	Harold_P linux is the kernel :-)
03:44	<grimboy>	And versions of gnu tools
03:44	<DShepherd>	matthew: synaptic
03:44	<jpatota>	todayisagift, ubuntu is a verion of linux
03:44	<grimboy>	Linux is nothing without gnu tools
03:44	<Warbo>	jrsims: Did you lose your actual home directory?
03:44	<bkh>	There should be something like /etc/skel/ with a base gnome home dir stuff in it
03:44	<mcmahons>	todayisagift: it uses linux version 2.6 (that is linux kernel 2.6)
03:44	<matthew>	what is synaptic?
03:44	<jpatota>	that too
03:44	<earthen_>	matthew,  simantic or comand line atp-get install "name of package"
03:44	<suspekt>	i was about to say i always condisdured 'linux' in the way a person would talk about it is made of up of lots of diffrent core programs
03:44	<_tmx_dt2>	hey can any1 help me mount my ntfs primary hard drive that i can't find ever since I BSOD safe mode or not.  thanks
03:44	<NoUse>	todayisagift Linux is the the piece that talks to the hardware, if you want to know what version of Linux you are running run 'uname -a'
03:44	<jrsims>	Warbo: well, no. but everything in it is gone.
03:44	<Tweek888>	Can some one help me with configuring my nvidia drivers?
03:44	<shane_>	matthew - front end to apt
03:44	<Tweek888>	they're just not working..
03:44	<Warbo>	bkh: I think /etc/skel just has base stuff to log in, and once in GNOME makes it's own configs if they are not there
03:44	<NoUse>	todayisagift if you want to know what version of ubuntu you are running run 'lsb_release -a'
03:45	<Warbo>	jrsims: including hidden stuff?
=== iGuyzmo is now known as Guyzmo
03:45	<earthen_>	matthew, it the gui program for install software, it will download what you want and install it for you
03:45	<shane_>	nouse - good info
03:45	<grimboy>	_tmx_dt2: http://ubuntuguide.org/#mountunmountntfs
03:45	<jrsims>	Warbo: yeah. I just did an "ls -a" though, and it looks like I have some of my settings files back. Still, gnome won't fully load.
03:45	<bkh>	warbo: That's what I thought, but the guy said that didn't work...
03:45	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, does it show up in your bios or /etc/fstab?
03:46	<theCore>	how do I lock a package version in command line?
03:46	<matthew>	i cant find gui
03:46	<earthen_>	matthew, it in System-->Administration -->Synaptic package manager
03:46	<_tmx_dt2>	it shows up in bios lemme check etc/fstab
03:46	<todayisagift>	NoUse: the reason i ask is when i go to d/l VNC it asks linux (x86, x64, ia64) and i just dont know
03:47	<void^>	theCore: apt-cache policy
03:47	<_tmx_dt2>	i don't have a fstab folder :-x
03:47	<delire>	todayisagift: ia64 is Itanium. x64 is AMD64, x86 is generic intel
03:47	<cowbud>	w00t w00t dapper
03:47	<grimboy>	_tmx_dt2: It's not a folder
03:47	<delire>	cowbud: countdown to rockinpops
03:47	<matthew>	earthen ok i found it i download an app from a site now how do i install
03:47	<Warbo>	jrsims: Hmmm. Are you really concerned with your settings (ie. customised to the extreme like me) because maybe deleting them and letting them be remade might work. However, it may not be a settings problem, it may be a  network/authentication one
03:47	<cowbud>	delire: is there actually a countdown? :)
03:47	<earthen_>	matthew, GUI stands for Graphical User Interface
03:47	<delire>	cowbud: there should be!
03:47	<_tmx_dt2>	what is it?
03:47	<jdub>	todayisagift: you're looking for a vnc client?
03:47	<cowbud>	indeed there should be :)
03:47	<theCore>	void^: how do I lock one?
03:47	<earthen_>	matthew, if you can see your desktop you have gui
03:47	<kspath>	 /topic
03:48	<delire>	theCore: what do you mean by 'lock'?
03:48	<cowbud>	I got loads of systems waiting to get the official I know a snapshot would probably work but meh :)
03:48	<grimboy>	_tmx_dt2: sudo gedit /etc/fstab from the terminal
03:48	<_tmx_dt2>	lol even i knew that ;)
03:48	<jrsims>	Warbo: well, I'm not too worried about my settings, and it does look like many of the settings files were recreated when I attempted to log in again.
03:48	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2:, http://www.linuxforum.com/linux_tutorials/1/1.php
03:48	<todayisagift>	jdub: yea do you have any suggestions, i need to vnc, (with full control) from my unix machine to a windows machine
03:48	<delire>	cowbud: my bt client is chomping at the bit.. foaming even.
03:48	<earthen_>	matthew, if you downloaded it with the Synaptic package manager then it is allready installed
03:48	<Warbo>	jrsims: I have encountered this before, but I forgot how I solved it. I think it was a permission thing
03:48	<jrsims>	Warbo: so maybe it's not the fact that I killed my files, it's something else. I'm not sure what to do. Would an apt-get of gnome be an idea?
03:48	<jdub>	todayisagift: there's one installed by default, the frontend for it is called 'terminal server client' (under internet in your menu)
03:48	<_tmx_dt2>	how do you access the root in ubuntu?
03:48	<Flannel>	!tell _tmx_dt2 about root
03:48	<theCore>	delire: I have custom packages, and I don't want APT overwrite them
03:48	<grimboy>	delire: Speaking of that, how come all of ubuntu's bittorrent clients suck
03:48	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, sudo -s
03:49	<TTT_Travis>	is Ubuntu Server Dapper Drake going to be released in the next 24 hours too?
03:49	<delire>	theCore: right, are you talking about 'pinning'?
03:49	<matthew>	i downloaded it to my desktop
03:49	<_tmx_dt2>	whats sudo -s ?
03:49	<jdub>	todayisagift: always look for packages in ubuntu before going to random websites :)
03:49	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, from the command line
03:49	<Warbo>	jrsims: I think removing your user and adding it again might work better as I think there are important files in your home for logging you into X
03:49	<Flannel>	TTT_Travis: all Dapper versions will be released at the same time
03:49	<theCore>	delire: yea
03:49	<bimberi>	theCore: you can do it in Synaptic via the Package menu (Lock Version)
03:49	<grimboy>	delire: like su
03:49	<delire>	grimboy: i only use btdownloadcurses. i did try azureus for a few months.
03:49	<earthen_>	matthew, what did you download
03:49	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, type it then 'vi /etc/fstab'
03:49	<cowbud>	delire: :)
03:49	<_tmx_dt2>	oh nvm i ran terminal; i think thats the command line prompt you guys are tryn to mention lol
03:49	<cowbud>	jdub: you shit us not eh?
03:49	<theCore>	bimberi: I know but I want to do it in command line
03:49	<ali>	n00b question: i am trying to install mplayer but i am getting this error mplayer-386: Depends: libjack0.80.0-0 (>= 0.99.0) but it is not installable
03:49	<ali>	               Depends: libpolyp0 but it is not installable
03:49	<ali>	E: Broken packages
03:49	<jrsims>	Warbo: ok. do you know the command? is it just a 'useradd'?
03:50	<grimboy>	delire: Oops not you, and thanks
03:50	<matthew>	nero linux
03:50	<earthen_>	matthew, or what are you trying to install
03:50	<Warbo>	jrsims: either that or adduser :)
03:50	<bimberi>	theCore: ah, missed that bit ...
03:50	<bimberi>	ubotu tell theCore about pinning
03:50	<bkh>	I think useradd is System V way and adduser is BSD style...
03:50	<theCore>	bimberi: thanks
03:50	<ali>	anyone?
03:50	<jrsims>	Warbo: yeah, isn't there a difference - like you can add a user but it won't create a home dir, or something like that? Various adduser options?
03:51	<jdub>	jrsims: what is the problem?
03:51	<earthen_>	matthew, ok then you'll have to read the doc's for that as it is a custom install
03:51	<delire>	theCore: you'll need to specify your pinning in /etc/apt/preferences.
03:51	<bimberi>	theCore: yw :)
03:51	<matthew>	oh ok
03:51	<Warbo>	matthew: That isn't really needed as most funtionality is built into the file manager (it won't corrupt your discs like Explorer will) and then there is GnomeBaker and K3b which are very good and already in Ubuntu
03:51	<jrsims>	jdub: login from gdm is fine, but Gnome comes up with just a mouse pointer and background color
03:51	<shane_>	ali - installing via synaptic?
03:51	<earthen_>	matthew,  sorry I can't help with that maybe someone else here installed it
03:51	<Warbo>	jrsims: I honestly don't know (adduser seems fine whenever I use it)
03:51	<todayisagift>	jdub: what do i have to do to the windows machine to allow my unix box to connect
03:52	<jrsims>	Warbo: cool. I'll look at the man page and try that.
03:52	<Flannel>	jrsims: does gnome safe mode work?
03:52	<jdub>	todayisagift: either enable terminal services, or install a vnc server
03:52	<jrsims>	Flannel: hmm. have not tried!
03:52	<earthen_>	matthew,  you can serch in the  Synaptic package manager for another cd burner program though
03:52	<jdub>	jrsims: type ifconfig at the command line ->	is there a 'lo' interface listed?
03:52	<shane_>	K3b
03:52	<jrsims>	jdub: checking...
03:52	<sg47_>	I read about this single command thing to setup a server
03:52	<felipe__>	In which timezone are the guys who update the ubuntu download page. I'm waiting for the dapper link
03:53	<Warbo>	flannel: Doesn't gnome safe mode just turn off any custom startup programs? He can't even log in so I don't think it would help
03:53	<sg47_>	does it work with RC1 too?
03:53	<jdub>	sg47_: there's a server CD which you can use to install; one of the installation choices is 'LAMP server'
03:53	<Flannel>	Warbo: he can't get to GDM? or can't get into gnome?
03:53	<jrsims>	jdub: yes there is a lo
03:53	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, paste the contents of your /etc/fstab into a pastebot on the channel
03:53	<earthen_>	matthew, I think gnomebaker is sopost to be good
03:53	<delire>	theCore: there is a manpage on it somewhere. i can't remember right now. you can just use: 'Package: <PackageName>' on one line and then 'Pin: version <version number>' on the line below.
03:53	<Warbo>	Flannel: GNOME (just a pointer on a blank screen)
03:53	<dmbt>	k3b is the best burning software
03:53	<grimboy>	I think the whole, lamp out of the box thing is horribly biased.
03:53	<Warbo>	Flannel: I think it is permission problem
03:53	<jrsims>	Flannel: I get GDM, and login works, then it tries to open gnome and I get just a mouse pointer and the background color. I can move the mouse, but nothing else loads.
03:53	<dmbt>	whether you use gnome or not
03:54	<Flannel>	right, try safe mode.  see if that works.
03:54	<delire>	theCore: i like to use a wildcard for the version number: eg. 'Pin: version 0.6.7.*'
03:54	<shane_>	matthew - K3b is a great app for burning CD/DVDx
03:54	<sg47_>	can you give me the link to Dapper RC1?
03:54	<jrsims>	Flannel: k. back in a bit!
03:54	<theCore>	delire:  I already got it, thanks for the help
03:54	<delire>	theCore: np
03:54	<phreekbird>	ok is anyone able to help me? problems with source.list - here is the source list -->	http://pastebin.com/750397 and here is the error(s) im getting --->http://pastebin.com/750391    really like ubuntu but dang its a pain to get a sourcelist setup right
03:54	<bur[n] er>	sg47_: google and you'll find it no doubt
03:54	<grimboy>	Yeah, it's a share k3b is the only decent cd/dvd burner
03:54	<sg47_>	what crap?
03:54	<jdub>	jrsims: log in again, then put the output of 'ps afx' somewhere
03:55	<Antipodean>	hey all ;)
03:55	<Warbo>	grimboy: xcdroast was quite godd (haven't used it in a while) and it used a different interface to the "Nero stlye" that k3b and gnome-baker use
03:55	<ali>	please help me install mplayer, i am getting some errors
03:55	<delire>	phreekbird: you shouldn't need to edit the sources.list directly..

04:00	<bur[n] er>	server doesn't have X, desktop has a full GUI
04:00	<rob138>	bimberi, any reason why windows isn't loggin in?
04:00	<kspath>	 /ignore Antipodean
04:00	<rob138>	bimberi, heh or wouldn't
04:00	<shane_>	what is !tell?
04:00	<DShepherd>	sg47_: check ubuntu.com
04:00	<NoUse>	!tell shane_ about ubotu
04:00	<Warbo>	PrimoTurbo: Too many details to list, but I would guess every package has been rebuilt due to core libraries and gcc and things
04:00	<Antipodean>	sorry about putting that q in twice... that was a typo
04:00	<NoUse>	Antipodean edit /etc/fstab and remove the line with the hard drive you are trying to add
04:01	<bimberi>	rob138: no, samba might have logs in /var/log
04:01	<NoUse>	Antipodean then you can re-run that script
04:01	<shane_>	cool, thanks

04:02	<jdub>	Saj: double click on the install icon on the desktop
04:02	<threat>	so the Ubuntu live CD runs off the CD, can it also install Ubuntu onto a hard disk drive?
04:02	<_tmx_dt2>	hey guys.  i finally mounted my c:\ but i don't know how to get write access to my external HD that i just plugged in.. lil help?
04:02	<bimberi>	Saj: which liveCD? you can't with Breezy
04:02	<Warbo>	Saj: If you are in Dapper live cd there is an icon
04:02	<bur[n] er>	jdub: nice to see yer nick on irc again :)
04:02	<shane_>	threat - yes
04:02	<jdub>	threat: in dapper, yes

04:03	<_tmx_dt2>	hey guys.  i finally mounted my c:\ but i don't know how to get write access to my external HD that i just plugged in.. lil help?
04:03	<shane_>	threat - newest release
04:03	<threat>	_tmx_dt2, c:\? you mean /dev/hda1?
04:03	<jdub>	Saj: that's not dapper
04:03	<_tmx_dt2>	sda1.. thats where my primary HD Is
04:03	<bur[n] er>	jdub: of course, dapper's great!
04:03	<windex>	genuine question, amazing: can the bootloader that ships with amd64 editions of ubuntu boot 32 bit windows?
04:03	<Warbo>	saj: Then you are using Breezy (latest stable) not Dapper (latest, but "unstable" until later today)
04:03	<threat>	shane_, oh, so the worty hog isn't the latest?
04:03	<mianos>	re
04:03	<threat>	oh, so a knew Ubuntu is due out soon?
04:03	<Saj>	then how to i install this one guys?
04:03	<jdub>	threat: warty was released in october 2004 :)
04:03	<threat>	jdub, lol
04:03	<bimberi>	threat: well W is further down the alphabet
04:03	<mianos>	little question about suspend in ubuntu
04:04	<Warbo>	windex: Yes, it doesn't do it itself, it just hands over to windows' own bootloader (chainloading)
04:04	<jdub>	threat: there are >	890 people here because 6.06 LTS is about to be released
04:04	<threat>	jdub, well what is the name of the latest one?
04:04	<OmniDistortion>	I didn't even know a new version was coming out, I was just about to download myself breezy!
04:04	<threat>	jdub, oh nice
04:04	<jdub>	threat: Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (codename Dapper Drake)
04:04	<beerboybeerboy>	890 people???????
04:04	<NoUse>	Saj download the install CD
04:04	<bimberi>	jdub: peaked at ~925 a couple of hours ago :)
04:04	<beerboybeerboy>	In Oct 2004, there were about 50 to 100
04:04	<codergeek42_>	886 to be more precise... ;)
04:04	<windex>	Warbo: i know that, but i couldn't remember if grub was 32/64 bit native or 16bit.
04:04	<Saj>	:'(
04:04	<threat>	jdub, how long? I was just about to download 5.10 :P
04:04	<jdub>	bimberi: slackers!
04:04	<Saj>	:'(:'(:'(
04:04	<OmniDistortion>	887 people WRONG
04:04	<jdub>	threat: see the topic
04:04	<shane_>	breezy is soooo yesterday
04:04	<NoUse>	Saj just wait 24 hours and get dapper
04:04	<shane_>	er, today still
04:04	<mianos>	the button on logout? does it just echo disk >	/sys/power/state, or are there other scripts (dapper)
04:04	<mianos>	??
04:04	<Warbo>	16bit? It supports large drives I know
04:04	<Saj>	hmm
04:04	<threat>	jdub, woot
04:05	<threat>	jdub, thank you :)
04:05	<uncreative>	my pop mail got corrupt, but i have a month old backup, i still have all my mail on gmail - but it won't re-download into Mail - does anyone know of some way i can reset some flag on the last month of emails within gmail so that it will redownload into my pop3 Mail?
04:05	<beerboybeerboy>	I take pride in the fact that I started using Ubuntu from the Warty days though I still ask some dumb questions even now
04:05	<jrsims>	Flannel: ok, I tried logging in in safe mode, still no go. Doesn't work for root either.
04:05	<Saj>	yeh
04:05	<threat>	jdub, I will wait then
04:05	<Saj>	might aswell wait:)
04:05	<Saj>	but which will be more stable breezy or dabber?
04:05	<OmniDistortion>	I WONDER
04:05	<shane_>	dapper...
04:05	<threat>	6.06?  doesn't that mean it will be released on the 6th of june?
04:05	<Warbo>	beerboybeerboy: Like many people switched to unstable Ubuntu to get XGL, I switched to unstable breezy to get kde3.5 and xcompmgr
04:05	<windex>	Saj: they dont make a release until its reasonably stable.. thats why they make us wait.
04:05	<mianos>	ah, there is a gconf key
04:05	<mianos>	yeah
04:05	<CronoDekar>	means '06 june
04:05	<Saj>	hmmm
04:06	<codergeek42_>	threat: IIRC it's year.month  for the release numbers
04:06	<Saj>	kool
04:06	<shane_>	june 06
04:06	<threat>	oh
04:06	<[arcane] >	how would i add a unstable brach to debian ??
04:06	<[zero] >	Hey
04:06	<threat>	ok thank you :)
04:06	<Saj>	ubuntu rock solid
04:06	<OmniDistortion>	Saj It's a completely new version, it's most likely going to be better in every way imaginable especially in stability
04:06	<beerboybeerboy>	I'm not yet ready to use it as my desktop machine now though I dual boot in my laptop
04:06	<windex>	codergeek42_: uh.. you mean month.year? :)
04:06	<DShepherd>	Saj:  getting there
04:06	<Saj>	installed PClinuxOS a 2 days ago, damn
04:06	<[zero] >	im on ubuntu at last :D
04:06	<CronoDekar>	no, year.month
04:06	<Saj>	every thing crashed in that lol
04:06	<beerboybeerboy>	after I changed jobs, I had to work on Windows entirely
04:06	<threat>	how long does it normally take for the Mirrors to get the latest version?
04:06	<Warbo>	[arcane] : look in /etc/apt/sources.list for stable or sarge and replace with unstable or sid
04:06	<windex>	CronoDekar: oh, right. silly 6/6
04:06	<threat>	or should I hammer the official site?
04:06	<[zero] >	Not on the PC I wanted to run it on but oh well
04:06	<CronoDekar>	:D
04:06	<[arcane] >	Warbo: thx
04:07	<Madpilot>	threat, releases they usually get out to the mirrors fairly quickly
04:07	<Saj>	so i basicly downloaded this on the 27th day of the 5 months
04:07	<threat>	or etch :)
04:07	<Saj>	lol:D
04:07	<shane_>	PCLinuxOS is ok - it's the community support for Ubuntu that won me over
04:07	<pally>	it feels like Xmas eve
04:07	<Saj>	yeh
04:07	<OmniDistortion>	When I dual boot for some reason windows fucks with the boot sector and the entire drive dies
04:07	<mister_roboto>	anyone try mepis?
04:07	<Flannel>	pally: nah, it feels like the night before Win95 was released ;)
04:07	<pally>	lol
04:07	<pally>	anyone kiss me when dapper is released?
04:07	<Warbo>	OmniDistortion: Always install Linux second

04:08	<mister_roboto>	shane: fizzled how?

04:08	<Flannel>	Nullified: you havent, and that's ok ;)
04:08	<threat>	Nullified, ubuntu doesnt have a root as such
04:08	<earthen_>	anyone know how to get blutooth stuff working?
04:08	<Warbo>	Nullified: Neither have I. Ubuntu doesn't use it
04:08	<Madpilot>	ubotu, tell Nullified about sudo
04:08	<OmniDistortion>	Warbo: Oh I did believe me, but I didn't use windows until much later. It was installed first.
=== delire is now known as delire_nacht
04:08	<Saj>	is dabber going to have KDE on it?
04:08	<beerboybeerboy>	Nullified, what was the password that you set when you installed Ubuntu?
04:08	<mianos>	why does glxgears in ubuntu doesn't display frames?
04:08	<Flannel>	!tell earthen_ about bluetooth
04:08	<OmniDistortion>	When I used it that's when it happened
04:08	<shane_>	they were growing fast, but Ubuntu has simply skyrocketed in outperforming all other distro installations
04:08	<Nullified>	Ok, Whats the command to start Gnome, is it /etc/init.d/gdm start ?
04:08	<Antipodean>	NoUse: bugger - that still didn't work...
04:09	<Antipodean>	argh
04:09	<OmniDistortion>	Hello nhaines (namedropping)
04:09	<Warbo>	OmniDistortion: The only way I could think of messing with MBR would be to do a "restore" or something in windows (which would be quite obviously the culprit)
04:09	<Flannel>	!tell mianos about glxgears
04:09	<mister_roboto>	shane: I simply could NOT get ubuntu to boot on an old P2-300 so I tried mepis for fun (never saw it before). so far it's running great and is using some dapper repositories too.
04:09	<NoUse>	Antipodean what are you trying to do?
04:09	<nhaines>	Haha, hiya, Omni.  :)
=== babo is now known as linu
04:09	<Antipodean>	mount & format a HD
04:09	<earthen_>	Flannel, I have the bluetooth device working and it can see my mouse but the mouse will not move the pointer
04:09	<shane_>	Mr_roboto - i ran mepis for a while and out of the box it was great, but just seemed a bit cluttered
04:09	<NoUse>	Antipodean well you can't format a HD while its mounted
04:09	<OmniDistortion>	Warbo: I really just don't want to mess with it anymore. I'm not going to dualboot with XP unless I know for sure nothing like that would happen again
04:10	<NoUse>	Antipodean so why don't you just format it
04:10	<mianos>	is ubotu a bot?
04:10	<Antipodean>	with the disk manager? done that about 3 times now
04:10	<rixxon>	what means 'software 3.0'? it is mentioned on the fridge
04:10	<nhaines>	I highly recommend backing up your MBR first.  WinXP had managed to screw mine up, and WinXP recovery console couldn't fix it.  Only a Knoppix CD and a friend who's insane enough to be able to hack the NTFS header by hand could do it.
04:10	<shane_>	and you're right about th eP2 300 support - tried ubuntu on something similar the other day and it didn't work
04:10	<Flannel>	mianos: yes
04:10	<mister_roboto>	!ubotu
04:10	<ubotu>	Yep, that's me! I'm a bot alright. Read http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbotuUsage to find out how to use me. Do NOT play with me in any channel except #debian-bots.

04:10	<Warbo>	Does anyone know of some simple sound editor like Audacity, but not Audacity (I can't get my head around it). I am forced to use gnoise, but I don't like how that writes the changes directly to the file

04:12	<jdub>	rixxon: it's a joke about that, yes
04:12	<NobodHere>	hey all!  My ubuntu server box just started acting up -big- time about 4 hours ago.  It is acting like DNS is broken, but it's not.  Apache and MySQL are fine; postfix is taking forever to respond to SMTP connections, same with cyrus and sshd.  Bind(named) is fine.
04:12	<rixxon>	Flannel: whatever that would mean, since web 2.0 means websites like software :p
04:12	<rixxon>	(kinda)
04:12	<Warbo>	rixxon: It doesn't really mean anything (anyway, Ubuntu is almost at 6!)
04:12	<WimS>	i can ask dapper questions here right?
04:12	<jdub>	absolutely
04:12	<_tmx_dt2>	noob question: can winrar or winace decompress .tar.gz files?

04:13	<Saj>	yeh
04:13	<edvinasMD5>	_tmx_dt2, yes

04:18	<lukaswayne9>	Warbo: I use audacity... That's pretty much it for me
04:19	<shane_>	Warbo - give audacity another try
04:19	<phreekbird>	!info sources
04:19	<EmuMatte>	NobodHere - have you tried repairing your windows installation?
04:19	<Warbo>	lukaswayne9: I can't seem to do anything in it other than crazy effects, all I want is to cut and paste and fade
04:19	<Saj>	hey, will dabber have the ability to start from the cd?
04:19	<lukaswayne9>	Warbo there's a fade plugin for audacity.. just select an area, and use the plugin
04:19	<NobodHere>	EmuMatte: What?
04:19	<shane_>	cut, paste and fade are the only things I can do in Audacity
04:19	<nhaines>	Saj, what do you mean?
04:20	<Zambezi>	Saj: You probably talking about a Live-CD?
04:20	<Saj>	yeh
04:20	<lukaswayne9>	Warbo: for cut/paste, just make sure playback is stopped.. and then just zoom out, select and area, and then edit..cut..paste etc
04:20	<Saj>	soz...
04:20	<eugman>	Can someone tell me what sudo apt-get clean does? Please refrain from giving the most obvious and simple answer which can be gleaned just by looking at it.
04:20	<Antipodean>	*shrugs*
04:20	<earthen_>	how do I rescan for my usb devices,
04:20	<tritium>	eugman: deletes .debs from /var/cache/apt/archives
04:20	<Warbo>	lukaswayne9: Whenever I try to select an area I end up changing it's volume. I suppose I'll have ANOTHER go
04:20	<eugman>	Ah, ok thanks.
04:20	<kspath>	earthen_: lsusb
04:21	<shane_>	http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/dapperrc
04:21	<Saj>	so is live cd gonna have install thing then?
04:21	<shane_>	clean clears out  the  local  repository  of  retrieved  package
04:21	<shane_>	              files.
04:21	<Zambezi>	Saj: So if you want to try, use the Live-CD.
04:21	<Flannel>	Saj: yes, espresso is on the liveCD.
04:21	<Antipodean>	all i wanna do is use my hard disk... *bashes head against wall*
04:21	<Warbo>	Hmmm. Error initialising audio layer when I start Audacity
04:21	<kspath>	earthen_: trying to force recognition of a device ? was it powered off?
04:21	<bimberi>	Saj: yes the dapper (6.06 LTS) one will
04:21	<earthen_>	kspath, no that lists my connected devices, I want to rescan for connected devices I removed a device that works but when i plug it back in I have ti reboot to get it to work again
04:21	<Zambezi>	Saj: Ye. In the memory. Not the Harddrive.
04:21	<Saj>	:(
04:22	<Saj>	ok il dl install cd instead then:)
04:22	<Antipodean>	*bleeding profusely from head injury*
04:22	<Ophiocus>	i ll be afk, wish you all a happy dapper upgrade, seeyas!!
04:22	<earthen_>	kspath, yes how do I do that
04:22	<Flannel>	Zambezi: the Dapper LiveCD can install.
04:22	<Zambezi>	Saj: But a Live-CD is just a temporary thing.
04:22	<Flannel>	Zambezi: the Dapper LiveCD can install.
04:22	<NobodHere>	well, thanks for the smart-ass replies to a serious problem, guys.  Glad to see the ubuntu "community" is knowledgeable and interested in helping others.
04:22	<Warbo>	Saj: I would get a breezy install disc because I have heard bad things about installing with dapper CDs (should be fixed now though, but you never know)
04:22	<shane_>	can the live cd install without booting into ubuntu/
04:22	<Zambezi>	Flannel: I just tried the Breezy.
04:23	<Flannel>	shane_: no.
04:23	<bur[n] er>	shane_: from windows?  no
04:23	<KarlsBerg>	Hello!
04:23	<Antipodean>	sorry - can anybody help - I have a HD, showing in the diskmanager that STILL shows as NTFS despite multiple formating  done with the diskmanager & which I still can't seem to get mounted? Suggestions anybody?

04:23	<shane_>	no, without booting into the live CD
04:23	<Saj>	warbo: hmmm, so will breezy be updatable to dapper via the synaptic thing?
04:23	<|Sivik|>	hi all
04:23	<Flannel>	shane_: no, the liveCD has to do it's liveCD thing.
04:23	<Flannel>	Saj: yes
04:23	<EmuMatte>	saj - yes
04:23	<bur[n] er>	Antipodean: run gparted not through the installer, make sure to hit apply
04:23	<earthen_>	kspath, how do I do a force recognition
04:23	<jdub>	Saj: there will be a very sexy upgrade process
04:23	<Saj>	oh, thats kool then, il just DL breezt now:D
04:23	<EmuMatte>	jdub -- if sexy mean "rapish"

04:27	<eugman>	Efinian, Nothing.  I've already upgraded. I was just under the impression it be released already and was wondering if there was a reason for having to do it a bit later in the day?
04:27	<Healot>	Warez doesn't exist in Linux-land
04:27	<T-CAN>	hahaha, exactly
04:27	<EmuMatte>	Healot -- ...
04:27	<mumanddad>	what package do i need to install to compile sources?
04:27	<tritium>	warez are also offtopic
04:28	<EmuMatte>	mumanddad -- headers / gcc
04:28	<bimberi>	mumanddad: build-essential
04:28	<nhaines>	eugman, it takes time to build 4 releases times three projects.
04:28	<Warbo>	Will there be a big upgrade at the release or not, as it is all stabilised now?
04:28	<tritium>	mumanddad: you'll want to start with build-esential
04:28	<mumanddad>	thanks
04:28	<mumanddad>	thats the one :-)
04:28	<Warbo>	I mean from current Dapper
04:28	<lukaswayne9>	Is there a server upgrade guide available?
04:28	<Antipodean>	so folks, whats the better filesystem to use ext2, or ext3?
04:28	<jdub>	Warbo: dude, we're like, hours away
04:29	<jdub>	Antipodean: ext3
04:29	<Antipodean>	jdub: thnx
04:29	<Warbo>	Antipodean: ext3, it is the same as ext2 so it is compatible (but has a journal)

04:30	<paradon>	OmniD: The internet will break.
04:31	<OmniD>	I won't be rushing to download it if I don't know if it's released
04:31	<Warbo>	Does anyone know why epiphany would crash every time it tries to load? I've purged and reinstalled and stuff (I almost built from source, but couldn't be bothered to tell it that I have the dependencies)
04:31	<capgadget>	Movie downloads will slow 3% when Dapper is released.
04:31	<Warbo>	nhaines: thx
04:31	<Efnian>	brandon_, I'd imo recommend not to use the repos
04:31	<neoshin>	i want a pony
04:31	<brandon_>	Efnian, the one in the repos doesn't work, the one from the website doesn't work
04:32	<Warbo>	neoshin: apt-get install pony
04:32	<bur[n] er>	anyone know what to use in gconf-editor under the metacity global keybindings to get a binding on Page Up and Page Down?

04:33	<threat>	:P
04:33	<henriquemaia>	Just an advice: would be these daily builds good enough? I have to install Dapper on a friend's computer for her to complete a work for school.
04:33	<chapium>	plus ubuntu.com changed their front page
04:34	<bur[n] er>	henriquemaia: yes
04:34	<Efnian>	brandon_, the one on the website should work by just uncompressing it somewhere within your home directory and running it.
04:34	<henriquemaia>	I don't mind of dist-upgrading later.
04:34	<nhaines>	jdub, is there any way to observe the release process?  Such as the progress of the CD images being built?  Or whatever else they're doing right now?
04:34	<FoX_44470>	yes, because the download page is the same
04:34	<brandon_>	Efnian, so it's just a java issue then?
04:34	<Efnian>	brandon_, how exactly it doesn't work?
04:34	<bkh>	Yeah, there are now 5 people dancing instead of 3...
04:34	<henriquemaia>	Thanks bur[n] er.
04:34	<guano>	henriquemaia skip the daily builds.. install 5.10 and upgrade it, it will install fresh dapper
04:34	<Viaken>	I wish I could dist-upgrade. Dialup isn't dist-upgrade friendly.
04:34	<jdub>	nhaines: not really (mostly because nothing much is happening right now)
04:34	<henriquemaia>	I have done that with... no luck
04:34	<henriquemaia>	The system broke.
04:35	<henriquemaia>	hehe.
04:35	<cge>	henriquemaia: I would use the dailies instead.
04:35	<cge>	henriquemaia: If you can get them... The servers seem rather slow right now.
04:35	<brandon_>	Efnian, it starts and then a popup message thatw e all know and love happens and won't go away, but the application window isn't there, and the tray icon isn't there
04:35	<henriquemaia>	the breezy-dapper dist-upgrade didn't go well.
04:35	<guano>	i just dist-upgraded a ppc and i'm running true dapper... it's pretty :)
04:35	<nhaines>	jdub: aww, too bad.  I don't want to pester for ETA, but waiting is easier if you can watch things.  :)
04:35	<cluehammer>	phh real men dist-upgrade over null modem cables
04:35	<Efnian>	brandon_, it think the website one works best with sun's java. do you have it configured?
04:35	<nhaines>	henriquemaia, you shouldn't dist-upgrade from breezy to dapper.

04:36	<chapium>	then they where shirts

04:36	<henriquemaia>	ist this the link for the daylies? http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/
04:36	<Warbo>	Viaken: It would be good to only have security-updates (but still have access to repos) for dialup users
04:36	<Viaken>	upgraded*
04:36	<chapium>	pretty soon they will be wearing eskimo hats
04:36	<cluehammer>	lol
04:36	<Viaken>	Warbo: It's a laptop with wireless, so it's not a huge issue. :)
04:36	<brandon_>	Efnian, well obviously it's not properly configured, but i grabbed it from sun's site and replaced the one from the repos by renaming the newer one to the same name as the old version's directory

04:39	<ray__>	!tell ray__ about pastebin
04:39	<ray__>	hmmm

04:42	<intelikey>	ooooh temp desync from server....
04:42	<henriquemaia>	Thanks, slavik
04:42	<FoX_44470>	<lukaswayne9>	yes, very difficult for me, but it's life !
04:42	<intelikey>	hehhe i was wondering why no one was talking.... then it resynced.
04:42	<|Sivik|>	Warbo: k

04:43	<Booo>	sorry just signed in ..so is Ubuntu 6.06 out yet?
04:43	<ray__>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14940
04:43	<nhaines>	booo: no.
04:43	<intelikey>	k
04:43	<slavik>	Booo: not yet
04:43	<lukaswayne9>	Boo /topic
04:43	<bkh>	Booo: The duck is still getting dressed.
04:43	<Booo>	slavik: any idea when?
04:43	<OmniD>	UTC? What time is it UTC
04:43	<hassan>	wee, soooo excited.  tick tock
04:43	<ray__>	i'm just trying to get the TV to show exactly what's on my LCD at the moment
04:43	<lukaswayne9>	Oh great!  Just what I always wanted!  A new version of eject!
04:43	<Warbo>	Anyone tried Gnash?
04:43	<slavik>	soon?
04:43	<bimberi>	Booo: /topic !!
04:44	<davidmccabe>	http://lists.debian.org/cdwrite/2004/10/msg00052.html
04:44	<davidmccabe>	though that patch is from 2004, I'm still having that problem in Breezy.
04:44	<brandon_>	Efnian, that seems to have worked, except that i can't get that damned message to go away
04:44	<nhaines>	It is 03:44 UTC
04:44	<Booo>	bimberi: thanks
04:44	<bimberi>	Booo: np :)
04:44	<FoX_44470>	No, 2h44 UTC
04:44	<jaime>	hello everybody
04:44	<nhaines>	Hi, jai  :)
04:45	<intelikey>	ray__ mmmm no v4l in the modules ?
04:45	<Booo>	i feel like a kid on the night before x-mas :)
04:45	<ubuntu>	can some one help m einstall ubuntu?
04:45	<jaime>	how you doing
04:45	<ubuntu>	good
04:45	<nhaines>	I mean jaime, sorry.  :)
04:45	<ray__>	intelikey, v4l?
04:45	<nhaines>	What is the problem, ubuntu?
04:45	<jaime>	its ok
04:45	<chapium>	Hmm, I screwed up my x-session permissions or something.  How do I update ubuntu's time by the terminal?
04:45	<intelikey>	vidio for linux
04:45	<ubuntu>	can u install ubuntu onto harddrive from a live cd?
04:45	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Have you tried yet? If you have a problem what is it?
04:45	<Efnian>	brandon_, i'm not sure what message you mean, but open the  Help ->	 About, and try to close the message again, while the about box open.
04:45	<Warbo>	Ubuntu: From Dapper you can, not Breezy (latest stable)
04:45	<ubuntu>	i just want to know how i install from a live cd?
04:46	<nhaines>	ubuntu, yes, with Ubuntu 6.06 you can do so.
04:46	<ubuntu>	how?
04:46	<Bilford>	Is anyone planning on not upgrading to Dapper?
04:46	<bimberi>	ubuntu: the 6.06 LTS LiveCD has an Install icon on the desktop
04:46	<nhaines>	ubuntu, there will be an "install" icon on the desktop of the Desktop CD (live CD)
04:46	<intelikey>	Bilford i
04:46	<your_mom>	whats the sudo apt to install xorg. it seems i uninstalled, and messed up my whole system
04:46	<brandon_>	Efnian, i started using the newest version from the site, and it works. thanks!
04:46	<Warbo>	ubuntu: If you see a HD install icon in the CD then you can. If not then you have the "old" version
04:46	<Bilford>	intelikey, why not
04:46	<intelikey>	already there
04:46	<nhaines>	Bilford, I've been running dapper for three months with no problems.
04:46	<ubuntu>	ok cool
04:46	<brandon_>	Efnian, as a matter of fact, this should be in the wiki
04:46	<Efnian>	brandon_, what?
04:46	<ray__>	intelikey, what is v4l? i've never heard of that
04:47	<lukaswayne9>	nhaines: same here, i've been running it pretty since the repos were available.. i was dapper tried and true, even through all the X breakages
04:47	<Bilford>	nhaines, is that when the first release was?
04:47	<ubuntu>	and i heard u can do a dual boot, like windows and ubuntu? can hard drive install ubuntu and not erase windows?
04:47	<brandon_>	Efnian, how to get azureus to work, because a lot of people are having java related trouble with it
04:47	<nictuku>	ubuntu, indeed you can
04:47	<chapium>	ubuntu: if the partitions are already setup you probably can
04:47	<pike__>	ubuntu: yes the installer can resize your windows partition and create a new one for ubuntu
04:47	<ubuntu>	how do i do that?
04:47	<ubuntu>	k
04:47	<chapium>	pike__: oooo
04:47	<lukaswayne9>	Does the Ubuntu Desktop CD resize NTFS?
04:47	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Ubuntu will see windows and ask if you want to shrink it to make room for Ubuntu (you need free space in Wndows in order to shrink it) then you get a choice when you boot for windows or ubuntu
04:48	<nhaines>	Bilford, no, it started in November, I think, but I usually wait until about four or five months in before trying.
04:48	<mawa>	cool with the chrink feature, does it work well?
04:48	<mawa>	shrink
04:48	<Efnian>	brandon_, noprob, i think the repo one, which is optimized for blackdown java, is fairly easy to install.
04:48	<jaime>	nhaines do you got msn so we can chat
04:48	<ubuntu>	ok when i clikc on the "cd" on the desktop i see a folder that says install, is that what folder i go in?
04:48	<Efnian>	brandon_, although i prefer the official one, it's cleaner.
04:48	<nhaines>	mawa, yes, it works extremely well.
04:48	<Warbo>	ubuntu: It is much easier to set up with Dapper though, as it has graphics (Breezy install CD is text-based)
04:48	<nhaines>	jaime I do have msn, yes.
04:48	<jaime>	can you add me
04:48	<ubuntu>	oo ok
04:48	<intelikey>	ray__ i'm not 'sure' you need v4l to get that to work.   but  apt-cache search v4l
04:49	<ubuntu>	can i download drapper while i am on the live cd?
04:49	<ubuntu>	then install?
04:49	<jaime>	jaimesdemoyan@hotmail.com
04:49	<slavik>	ubuntu, why?
04:49	<Warbo>	ubuntu: You cannot install from breezy livecd (like you have), it is not hidden away, it is not there
04:49	<ubuntu>	never mind
04:49	<ubuntu>	so i have to download drapper, then burn it to a cd and the ninstall it?
04:49	<intelikey>	ray__ was v4l not an option in the modules section of your config ?
04:49	<jaime>	i have some problems with my ubuntu and i think you can help me fix them
04:49	<slavik>	ubuntu, just wait for the release livecd
04:49	<T-CAN>	has anyone in here tried building a Linux from scratch system?
04:49	<ubuntu>	when is that?
04:49	<mawa>	is there any "known" reason to why would not be able to access the capture controls in alsamixer?
04:50	<Warbo>	ubuntu: If you download the Dapper cd you will not be able to save it if you use windows xp (linux cannot write to ntfs partitions) unless you save it to a usb drive or something
04:50	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: Does Archlinux count? :)
04:50	<paradon>	T-CAN: I did, a long time ago.
04:50	<ubuntu>	what?
04:50	<T-CAN>	how did it turn out?
04:50	<Warbo>	ubuntu: I mean from within the LiveCD
04:50	<ubuntu>	ok
04:50	<paradon>	T-CAN: Initial setup isn't _too_ bad... updates are a b****
04:50	<hassan>	linux from scratch was too hard for me and i've done stage 1 from stage 3 tarball gentoo with no problems
04:50	<T-CAN>	ya, i can imagine
04:50	<ubuntu>	so if i get out of the live cd and use windows and download drapper then burn it to a cd then install it?
04:50	<ray__>	intelikey, that doesn't seem to be what i need. nvidia drivers should work just fine
04:50	<slavik>	hassan: is that your first name?
04:51	<Flannel>	ubuntu: right.
04:51	<nhaines>	jaime, sure, what's your MSN Messenger username?
04:51	<paradon>	As in, I never updated stuff at all unless I really needed to...
04:51	<T-CAN>	hassan, really?
04:51	<ubuntu>	ok
04:51	<ubuntu>	cool
04:51	<hassan>	last name
04:51	<Bilford>	nhaines, when do you think the first Edgy releasse will be
04:51	<ray__>	especially with all the howtos i've seen
04:51	<jaime>	jaimesdemoyan@hotmail.com
04:51	<ubuntu>	whats the big difference between drapper and breazy badger?
04:51	<Flannel>	Bilford: edgy will release in octover
04:51	<slavik>	nvm then
04:51	<your_mom>	whats the sudo apt to install xorg. it seems i uninstalled, and messed up my whole system, any help pleae
04:51	<intelikey>	ray__ other than the missing v4l  i don't see any thing that looks  amiss
04:51	<Bilford>	Flannel, not official
04:51	<Bilford>	Flannel, testing releases
04:51	<h3h_timo>	has anyone ever tried xubuntu on an xbox?
04:51	<nhaines>	Bilford, probably in a month or so.  But the actual release will be in mid-October.
04:51	<Flannel>	ubuntu: ubuntu.com/testing/dapperbeta
04:51	<Warbo>	your_mom: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
04:51	<paradon>	T-CAN: I went from LinuxFromScratch to SourceMage, which was a huge, huge improvement :-)
04:51	<ubuntu>	ok cool
04:51	<slavik>	"sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" to whoever messed up their install
04:52	<ubuntu>	is it easy to install for a newbie?
04:52	<ray__>	intelikey, say i dl'ed v4l-conf, would i specify something in xorg.conf myself?
04:52	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: arch linux is pretty cool if you want to learn the ins and outs of the system... it's kinda like a binary gentoo
04:52	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Yes, just read what it tells you carefully (it is a big step, installing an OS)
04:52	<T-CAN>	paradon, did you try LFS relatively early in your Linux career? did it help you learn a lot?
04:52	<nhaines>	ubuntu: it couldn't be easier.  Get the Desktop CD and then you can boot into it and install it from there.
04:52	<ubuntu>	yea i did damns small linux on my laptop
04:52	<hassan>	t-can yeah. lfs can be done but stick to a guide from the forums
04:52	<ubuntu>	this seems easier
04:53	<ubuntu>	anywho drapper is graphical u said, so that shoudl be easy
04:53	<intelikey>	ray__ and like i said.  i don't know that you need it,  but you can try adding    section "Module"   load  v4l
04:53	<intelikey>	in section modules that is
04:53	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Yep, it uses gparted I think (to shrink windows/create Linux partitions)
04:53	<nhaines>	Yes, it has a wizard with 7 pages, it asks just a couple questions, and then it goes to work.  :)
04:53	<ubuntu>	and in the graphical interface will it allow me to keep windows?
04:53	<SurfnKid>	I figured out why I was chopping
04:53	<nhaines>	ubuntu: yes.
04:53	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: i would reccommend Arch, I learned a lot from Arch
04:53	<ubuntu>	ok
04:53	<paradon>	T-CAN: Well, I'd been using Redhat 6 as my primary OS for about 2 years, and working as a sysadmin with Mandrake7 servers for about a year, when I installed LFS.  But yeah, I learned a fair bit.
04:53	<ubuntu>	cool thanks for the help
04:53	<ubuntu>	u guys are the best
04:53	<Warbo>	np
04:53	<jaime>	does any know where i can get linux manuals
04:54	<SurfnKid>	3Ddesk creates a burden on the CPU and chops the screensaver so no more 3D desk
04:54	<davidmccabe>	Samsung's support website is 404.
04:54	<ray__>	intelikey, one more question: everytime i save the xorg.conf file, do i have to restart?
04:54	<WoodwardAve>	repos are getting slammed
04:54	<ray__>	in order for changes to show up?
04:54	<intelikey>	only restart X  not a reboot
04:54	<Warbo>	Has anyone tried Gnash? Did they have problems with Macromedia/Adobe Flash since?
04:54	<SurfnKid>	hey intelikey I got my ATI card going =D now I can do cool graphics
04:55	<intelikey>	ray__ issue  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
04:55	<ray__>	i tried hitting ctrl+alt+backspace and i don't know how to get x to start up again
04:55	<cowbud>	when I do something like xterm -bg black it says color name "black" undefined and yet I have a /etc/X11/rgb.txt wtih black in it..any ideas?
04:55	<Warbo>	ray__: in a console (ctrl-alt-f1) type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart to restart the graphics without rebooting
04:55	<nhaines>	jaime, I'm sorry, I didn't see your message with your username.  I just added you.
04:56	<T-CAN>	lukaswayne9, so how do I get started with arch?
04:56	<SurfnKid>	Warbo is that how you start the gdm lets say if you dont go directly to the logon screen?
04:56	<intelikey>	SurfnKid good on ya there
04:56	<SurfnKid>	yep mate
04:56	<Warbo>	SurfnKid: Yes, it makes any temporary files it needs to (better than typing "sudo gdm")
04:56	<jaime>	speak to me
04:56	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: http://archlinux.org   They have an excellent guide from installing, setting up the system, and using the core tools
04:56	<jaime>	on msn
04:56	<intelikey>	SurfnKid just venella sudo gdm
04:56	<PrimoTurbo>	Anyone have any clue on when Ubuntu will be out I want to download it as soon as possible :p
=== IronMask_ is now known as IronMask
04:56	<pike__>	cowbud: if you designate a foreground too xterm -fg green -bg black does it work?
04:56	<nhaines>	PrimoTurbo, today.
=== cached is now known as DapperDrake
04:57	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: they also have a helpful community at #archlinux
04:57	<SurfnKid>	so If I disable the option to have the logon screen then I'll just have a prompt correct?
04:57	<Warbo>	SurfnKid: You cannot do that in a GUI though, as it will stop but not start again because the GUI telling it what to do is gone (use stop and start for that)
04:57	<nhaines>	Even though it messes with my connection lately!  :p
04:57	<intelikey>	SurfnKid yep
04:57	<SurfnKid>	ok cool
04:57	<paradon>	T-CAN: Archlinux is a fairly nice, fairly light, binary distro, with a very nice package build system that's very reminiscent of BSD Ports
04:57	<SurfnKid>	in case anyone wants to mess with this pc and I know how to get into the gdm =D
04:58	<Warbo>	SurfnKid: Use start instead of restart if it is not already running
04:58	<cluehammer>	only an hour to go!
04:58	<cowbud>	pike__: it comes up black fine but it complains about not having black defined..
04:58	<SurfnKid>	Warbo I gotcha
04:58	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: i used to be a hardcore archer.. really showed me the ropes of linux
04:58	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: i've made so many arch packages in my day
04:58	<SurfnKid>	so its always better to do it in one of the terminal screens
04:58	<SurfnKid>	cool
04:59	<intelikey>	SurfnKid also of note you might want to start x via the startx command.   that bypasses gdm and puts you right into the wm of your choice (gnome default)
04:59	<DapperDrake>	cluehammer: /topic
04:59	<Beforewisdom>	If I wait until tomorrow will the update manager take care of upgrading Ubuntu for me?
04:59	<sailorptah>	hello :)  I have an Acer TravelMate 8200 running Breezy Badger here, and it can't seem to find the network card, or the battery.  (It thinks it's running on AC power even when unplugged.  The problem is that I can't see how much power the battery has left.)  Help, please?
04:59	<SurfnKid>	ohh
04:59	<DapperDrake>	please dont ask that
04:59	<Beforewisdom>	;p;
04:59	<Beforewisdom>	lol
04:59	<Beforewisdom>	sorry
04:59	<paradon>	lukaswayne9: I haven't used it heavily, just on a couple of old machines where I wanted a lightweight distro with XFCE... but I'll almost certainly use it next time I want to make a "customised" server distro.  In the past I've used SourceMage... but compiling everything on every machine is annoying.
04:59	<intelikey>	SurfnKid most console users  use   startx  for X sessions
04:59	<SurfnKid>	how do i chose the WM of my choice with startx
04:59	<Warbo>	Beforewisdom: I doubt it. You will need to change breezy to dapper in your sources.list then it will do it
05:00	<cowbud>	SurfnKid: edit your .xinitrc
05:00	<leonel>	dapper  !!  come out come out wherever you are !
05:00	<SurfnKid>	i see
05:00	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: yeah.. arch has pretty nice optimizations as well
05:00	<SurfnKid>	thatll be homework for later
05:00	<Beforewisdom>	Warbo, I saw a post on slashdot that said the update manager should take care of it, was that post bullshit?
05:00	<intelikey>	SurfnKid you have to have other wm's installed to choose them.
05:00	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: i just installed ubuntu on my server, that's working out pretty nicely
05:00	<SurfnKid>	Im just getting the hang of this OS
05:00	<nhaines>	Beforewisdom, that's not true.  Your Upgrade Manager will let you upgrade automatically.
05:00	<MTecknology>	anybody know off hand what dependencies cvswine needs?
05:00	<SurfnKid>	intelikey, right I have a few already but dont come up on the session options
05:00	<Warbo>	Beforewisdom: If you redirect your update manager from breezy to dapper then it will be fine, you have to redirect it manually though
05:01	<slavik>	-d
05:01	<Shaezsche>	dapper is dumb if it cannot recognize software modems
05:01	<nhaines>	Warbo, that's nto true.  If he redirects it he will break it.
05:01	<leonel>	HEY  dapper  !!  come out come out wherever you are !
05:01	<Healot>	Shaezsche: no, you are :-
05:01	<Warbo>	Beforewisdom: There is a file /etc/apt/sources.list which you should open (as super user) and replace any "breezy" with "dapper" then reload synaptic
05:01	<Shaezsche>	seriously, how hard is it to program a linux distro to recognize modems?
05:01	<intelikey>	SurfnKid one can for instance issue a command like    startx /usr/bin/xfce4    to open an xfce session    iirc
05:02	<Flannel>	Shaezsche: how hard is it for the modem manufacturers to release the specifications of the modem?
05:02	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: http://linmodem.org
05:02	<Beforewisdom>	thanks warbo.  I might wait a few days, I can hear servers creaking now
05:02	<nhaines>	Beforewisdom, do not change your sources.list file.  You will break your install.
05:02	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: Seriously, how hard is it to make a modem that is a modem? :)
05:02	<Shaezsche>	viaken that prog doesnt recognize my modem
05:02	<Healot>	Shaezsche: Real modem, easy, soft modem lacks of driver and even a nit of support from manufacture
05:02	<Shaezsche>	and viaken why isnt that built into ubuntu?
05:02	<nhaines>	Beforewisdom, as soon as 6.06 is released, your update manager will offer to let you upgrade.
05:02	<intelikey>	SurfnKid be sure to tab complete commands like that.
05:02	<SurfnKid>	iirc as in chat?
05:02	<Warbo>	nhaines: My install is fine???
05:02	<SurfnKid>	right full path
05:02	<knanand>	what is de cmd to install rpm packages
05:02	<intelikey>	iirc=if i recall correctly
05:02	<Healot>	alien <rpm file>
05:02	<Warbo>	knanand: Use alien on them first, and that is a bit dodgy
05:02	<SurfnKid>	oh lol
05:02	<lukaswayne9>	well it's bedtime for me, night all
05:03	<nhaines>	Warbo, there is a special upgrade tool that handles the update and tranistional and obsoleted packages.
05:03	<Warbo>	nhaines: Does it? Cool
05:03	<SurfnKid>	hey is there a command line based IRC that i can get to in case i have trouble thru the terminal
05:03	<Shaezsche>	ubuntu also doesnt recognize laptop card readers
05:03	<Shaezsche>	at least rarely
05:03	<lwarimav>	Can anyone here tell me how to restore my firefox in ubuntu???
05:03	<spikeb>	SurfnKid, irssi
05:03	<SurfnKid>	sweet
05:03	<henriquemaia>	What's this? ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/
05:03	<SurfnKid>	thx
05:03	<SurfnKid>	might need that when all else fails
05:03	<spikeb>	SurfnKid, i think it is installed by default
05:03	<SurfnKid>	cuz im definitely not bootin to WXP
05:03	<SurfnKid>	ahh
05:04	<intelikey>	SurfnKid several in fact.  even xchat has a text mode
05:04	<SurfnKid>	oh
05:04	<knanand>	Warbo: is it alien <pkg_name>	??
05:04	<WhatTheDeuce>	Hey.  I'm having some trouble getting cl-curl working.  I've installed libcurl3-dev, cl-uffi, and cl-asdf, but when I try (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op :curl) (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :curl) I get errors
05:04	<SurfnKid>	yeah something so i can crank up and ask for help
05:04	<Healot>	Is anyone here who dumb enough to ask question about proprietary hardware?
05:04	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: These things are not so simple as you seem to think. Manufacturers worldwide are making their own, custom interfaces and hardware and not providing any documentation or help for people wanting to interface it. It's like trying to learn an alien language with no training programs, no books, just a native speaker that can't understand you, either.
05:04	<intelikey>	SurfnKid i'm using bx as we speak
05:04	<lwarimav>	How can I restore firefox???
05:04	<chron>	what is the gnome browser called?
05:04	<Warbo>	knanand: You need the rpm file in the directory your terminal is in (default is home) then "sudo alien packagefile.rpm"
05:04	<chron>	the command
05:04	<pike__>	lwarimav: what mean you restore? an easy workaround would be just download the updated firefox to your home directory and run it from there
05:05	<chron>	on ubuntu
05:05	<nhaines>	chron, epiphany
05:05	<intelikey>	lwarimav restore ?
05:05	<K|NgGh0sT>	How can I stop Kubuntu from displaying LCD ON,  every 4 mins
05:05	<nhaines>	chron,  Or maybe nautilus --browser
05:05	<klormexor>	< SurfnKid on irssi
05:05	<klormexor>	hehe
05:05	<intelikey>	chron nautilus ?
05:05	<Warbo>	chron: epiphany (not to be confused with the boulderdash clone)
05:05	<klormexor>	ok im outs
05:05	<lwarimav>	Firefox doesn't work....
05:05	<mrproper>	When I try to install vmware-player from multiverse, it says it cannot display the license.
05:05	<lwarimav>	Should I reinstalle it???
05:05	<chron>	ok thanks
05:05	<chron>	my friend not too good at linux
05:05	<chron>	needs a root browser
05:05	<chron>	to drag and drop fles
05:05	<chron>	heh
05:06	<chron>	i guess thats the friendliest way?  even though it's not secure
05:06	<pike__>	lwarimav: if you type 'killall firefox-bin' does that fix it?
05:06	<nbx909>	dapper is out
05:06	<nbx909>	ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/
05:06	<Shaezsche>	will ubuntu even recognize the intel 900 graphics chipset?
05:06	<nbx909>	ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso
05:07	<sailorptah>	Can anyone tell me how to get my laptop to detect the network card?  Or the battery?
05:07	<Warbo>	lwarimav: Has it been installed through Synapic/apt? Then I would try a complete removel (--purge) and reinstall if the problem persists
05:07	<nhaines>	nbx909, that is probably the release candidate.
05:07	<nbx909>	no it's not
05:07	<nbx909>	look at it
05:07	<nbx909>	the release clients have rc
05:07	<chron>	"epiphany: command not found"
05:07	<chron>	you sure thats the browser?
05:07	<Shaezsche>	its an alternate install iso
05:07	<Healot>	read the release document yet?
05:07	<lwarimav>	thank Warbo... I'll try that
05:07	<Shaezsche>	its rc
05:07	<chron>	or is it nautilus?
05:07	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: It's got 3D acceleration built into the kernel for intel I think
05:07	<sailorptah>	Okay, how about this: Can anyone HEAR me?  Are these messages coming through?
05:07	<knanand>	Warbo: alien cmd not found.
05:07	<nbx909>	sailorptah, ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
05:08	<sailorptah>	Ah, thank you.
05:08	<nbx909>	Shaezsche, ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
05:08	<intelikey>	lwarimav i'm not sure what you are wanting to restore though ?    if you mean reinstall it.  then apt-get purge it and then install ubuntu-desktop  but if you have broken it locally that wont help you.    test this.  do sudo useradd something && sudo passwd something     logout and login as something with the passwd you set.  then start ff and see if the break is local or system.
05:08	<Warbo>	chron: Epiphany is GNOME's favourite browser, but Ubuntu uses firefox (type it)
05:08	<chron>	i'm trying to drag and drop files as root, how would i do this?
05:08	<nbx909>	it has the rc along with all of them
05:08	<Warbo>	knanand: You need to install it (sudo apt-get install alien)
05:08	<sizzymia>	i'm trying to print to my photo tray with a HP photosmart 7760 and it won't work.  I can print with the normal tray, but not the photo tray.  any ideas?
05:08	<lwarimav>	ok intelikey
05:09	<SurfnKid>	I just thougght of this today, maybe you all have, but the fact that running an OS where you have no clue whats on the background, except maybe limited to only killing processes and viewing CPU time and load has made me think of linux now, it gets you involved, you actually know what is the pc loading to, module wise and processes wise, and if something fails even then you can code your way out of a crash
05:09	<kaled>	hmm, where are the .torrents?
05:09	<chron>	if you run nautilus as root
05:09	<argpirate>	anyone know where to get a newer version of kxdocker?
05:09	<chron>	are you looking at screw ups?
05:09	<intelikey>	lwarimav if it works for something  you have files in your normal users $HOME  that are causing the issue.  else it's a system break
05:09	<Warbo>	chron: Yes, especially for a newbie
05:09	<chron>	i'm trying to drag and drop files as root
05:09	<SurfnKid>	just a thought =D
05:09	<chron>	how can i do this?
05:09	<Flannel>	chron: gksudo nautilus
05:09	<Warbo>	chron: What files?
05:10	<chron>	ok thanks
05:10	<chron>	just alot of files
05:10	<chron>	from one hd to another
05:10	<Warbo>	chron: i mean, why do you need root?
05:10	<Flannel>	chron: just be careful ;)
05:10	<bkh>	SurfnKid: Yeah, having a system that isn't designed to hide things from you is a definite plus when you're learning this stuff...
05:10	<Warbo>	chron: Set the permissions properly and you have solved the underlying issue
05:10	<chron>	thats what i'm trying to get him to do
05:11	<bkh>	I certainly learned alot my first time using linux... but then, that was with slackware back around kernel 0.83 or so :)
05:11	<RTB|Waiting4Dapr>	chron?
05:11	<Shaezsche>	how can i edit the kernal?
05:11	<RTB|Waiting4Dapr>	ok nevermind\
05:11	<RTB|Waiting4Dapr>	I thought you were someone else
05:11	<bkh>	Shaezsche: Go to /usr/src/linux
05:11	<Shaezsche>	thanks
05:11	<intelikey>	welcome to the club SurfnKid
05:11	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: That's probably in the wiki, too, if you want more details.
05:12	<Harold_P>	So far all the links I've gotten, even the .pool one seem to be RC's
05:12	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: Install the source and go to it, then configure it and make it and use the bzImage it makes as your kernel
05:12	<Shaezsche>	navigating that wiki is daunting
05:12	<Shaezsche>	thanks
05:12	<Shaezsche>	what do you mean install the source? shouldnt it automatically be installed if i am running the operating system
05:12	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: I think it is in /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/build as well (linked)
05:12	<Shaezsche>	ok
05:12	<intelikey>	Shaezsche lol
05:13	<nhaines>	No, Shaezsche, only the binaries are installed when you run the OS.
05:13	<chapium>	help, the X just switched to 640x480 and i forgot the key combination that changes it.  Everything is huge now!
05:13	<Shaezsche>	well, how do i install the source? must it be dled?
05:13	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCompileHowto?highlight=%28kernel%29
05:13	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: No, the source is about 40MB+ which is not really needed. For building programs the linux-headers package suffices
05:13	<Shaezsche>	thanks via lol
05:13	<nosklo>	hmm seems like final version is here ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ ?
05:13	<Shaezsche>	NO nosklo stfu
05:13	<nbx909>	yep
05:13	<Viaken>	The search has always worked for me. :P
05:13	<nbx909>	that's it
05:13	<Shaezsche>	that was an alternate install version
05:13	<RTB|Waiting4Dapr>	?_o
05:13	<offby1>	is it straightforward to upgrade Debian Sarge to Dapper?
05:13	<Shaezsche>	i know nothing about linux but i KNOW thats  a RC
05:13	<intelikey>	Shaezsche you could install the full linux source tree including the source for all apps........  got a few tara to waste.
05:14	<intelikey>	?
05:14	<Warbo>	offby1: no
05:14	<nosklo>	it doesnt have the "rc' tag in the filename
05:14	<nbx909>	Shaezsche, the alternate verson means just a text install
05:14	<offby1>	Warbo: is there anything written about it, or should I not even try?
05:14	<nosklo>	and the modify date is today
05:14	<nbx909>	yeah
05:14	<Mixx>	look at the upload dates of them
05:14	<Hisakasex>	hello
05:14	<SurfnKid>	lol intelikey
05:14	<Krhis>	722b8b4a75f977a76a722d4a2b071b19  ubuntu-6.06-desktop-amd64.iso <<<< Not a RC?
05:14	<SurfnKid>	the Molecule screen saver has got me so hooked, im lovin it
05:14	<Warbo>	offby1: Well, I would recommend starting from scratch with Dapper, but if you don't mind wasting a bit of time you could have a go and learn a bit
05:14	<Viaken>	intelikey: I run Gentoo on my desktop. All the source is on it, and it only takes up 6G.
05:15	<Healot>	just let Mark announce the release...
05:15	<Viaken>	It's compressed, true, but it's there.
05:15	<RTB|Waiting4Dapr>	well the servers are up
05:15	<Healot>	greedy Ubuntu freaks
05:15	<offby1>	Warbo: what might you expect to be the problem?
05:15	<whitesuit>	ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
05:15	<whitesuit>	is it out?
05:15	<spikeb>	NO
05:15	<Flannel>	whitesuit: stop it.  no.
05:15	<SurfnKid>	bkh yeah just be able to code something even if you're not a programmer, im a network engineer i hate coding, im terrible with syntax, and look at me ive done a few things here and there
=== RTB|Waiting4Dapr is now known as GreedyUbuntuFrea
05:15	<spikeb>	until it's been announced, it's not out.
05:15	<PrimoTurbo>	whitesuit: thanks downloading now
05:15	<intelikey>	Viaken your All   and my  All   !=
05:15	<mumanddad>	what's the best way to allow remote logins to dapper?
05:15	<Bilford>	Mark Shuttleworth is going to announce it in here?
05:15	<Warbo>	offby1: PAckages are given different names and are built with different versions of glibc and stuff, meaning that they all conflict and the ones which do install may not work right
05:16	<GreedyUbuntuFrea>	ssh I think
05:16	<pike__>	mumanddad: im partial to freenx
05:16	<Viaken>	Meh...
05:16	<GreedyUbuntuFrea>	but i'm not a greedy ubuntu freak or anything
05:16	<ablyss>	mumanddad: the ablyss-a-fied way ;-)
05:16	<intelikey>	Viaken your all = all that you have installed.   my all = all there is.
05:16	<bzaks>	could anyone help me out? I tried installing php, but the phpmodule for apache didn't install
05:16	<whitesuit>	Flannel, what is that file then?
05:16	<offby1>	Warbo: ah.  You have properly frightened me :-)  Thanks
05:16	<Flannel>	whitesuit: not necessarily the final one.
05:16	<PrimoTurbo>	wait is that the release or no?
05:16	<DShepherd>	is ubuntu out now?

05:16	<DShepherd>	lysis: ok so far

05:16	<DShepherd>	GreedyUbuntuFrea: ok
05:16	<lysis>	DShepherd: ubuntu's been out for a while. =)
05:17	<Hisakasex>	help with postfix

05:17	<GreedyUbuntuFrea>	SORry
05:17	<lysis>	DShepherd: =)   did you mean dapper?  lol  ;)
05:17	<intelikey>	mumanddad no i'm a troll....
=== GreedyUbuntuFrea is now known as Roger_The_Bum
05:17	<DShepherd>	so who's been raising the false alarm
05:17	<Viaken>	Hm...speaking of that, I probably don't need the source for the past 4 versions of OOo...
05:17	<mumanddad>	lol
05:17	<intelikey>	:)
05:17	<PrimoTurbo>	hold on is dapper drake out yet or no? what am I downloading atm?
05:17	<DShepherd>	lysis: no i didnt i meant edgy :-)
05:17	<Roger_The_Bum>	the RC
05:17	<Hisakasex>	if I set $mynetwork to 127.0.0.1 do I need to set smptd_restriction_parameters also to something?
05:17	<pike__>	mumanddad: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreeNX
05:17	<mumanddad>	if your downloading from the website probably Breezy
05:17	<Roger_The_Bum>	127.0.0.1?
05:17	<mumanddad>	thanks pike
05:17	<Hisakasex>	only localhost
05:17	<Roger_The_Bum>	I'm So Hakcing you!!11!

05:18	<Roger_The_Bum>	I was going to do a connection reset by peer thing
05:18	<eXcentra>	lysis: it's just a joke ;P
05:18	<PrimoTurbo>	k I'll wait for offical word then
05:18	<nhaines>	PrimoTurbo, the website will be updated as soon as 6.06 is out.
05:18	<Warbo>	Roger_The_Bum: NO!! Whois says that's me!
05:18	<ablyss>	mumanddad: get sshd, set up /etc/hosts.allow, run a cron job to check for remote access via http that recognizing a "secret" pass to remote in, which the cron job will read and edit /etc/hosts.allow.. u then can safely remotely log into an encrypted system
05:18	<Hisakasex>	I don't want any machine in my network to send emails
05:18	<lysis>	well i wasn't here for the beginning of the joke!!! =)

05:23	<ablyss>	nefelim: just take note if you use QT theme engine with KDE, gtk apps will break often
05:23	<Roger_The_Bum>	ok never mind then
05:23	<nefelim>	what is qt?
05:23	<Warbo>	nefelim: The buttons and stuff KDE uses. GNOME uses GTK, they use different themes and stuff
05:24	<cluehammer>	enemy territory!
05:24	<SurfnKid>	!sensors
05:24	<lysis>	nefelim: sometimes girls call me a QT
05:24	<ubotu>	sensors is, like, totally, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SensorInstallHowto
05:24	<CheeseBurgerMan>	nefelim: KDEs graphic toolkit...like GTK for gnome.
05:24	<ablyss>	qt theme engine is a theme engine that makes gtk apps look like kde apps
05:24	<Strokerace>	it get an error when it goes to the desktop and gnome
05:24	<nbx909>	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185570

05:24	<nefelim>	so which is better gnome or kde?
05:24	<lysis>	i prefer gnome
05:24	<Viaken>	ah ok
05:24	<Strokerace>	KDE
05:24	<Warbo>	nefelim: Don't start a flame war!
05:24	<nhaines>	nefelim, they are both very good, but act a little different.
05:24	<Shaezsche>	if i disable my internal HD, and set my laptop to boot to an USB HD with the install CD in the drive, will it automatically intall on the external drive? or will i need to use a special command?

05:24	<Flannel>	nefelim: go to offtopic for WM wars ;)
05:25	<chron>	are file system checks done automatically on ubuntu?
05:25	<cluehammer>	you know, i bet ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso really IS the file seeing as how it's timestamped for this morning, still i'm waiting for the torrent
05:25	<Warbo>	nefelim: Try both and see which you prefer. I like features of both, but GNOME has more I like and less I dislike
05:25	<_nano_>	chron: you can set that on fstab
05:25	<chron>	how?
05:25	<nhaines>	I'm actually very impressed, there's like zero fighting between GNOME and KDE users on Ubuntu.
05:25	<Shaezsche>	?
05:25	<lwarimav>	how can i install the real Player10GOLD.bin???? a simple installation
05:25	<chron>	oh yea the dump/pass right?
05:25	<Roger_The_Bum>	same
05:25	<_nano_>	chron: yea
05:25	<bimberi>	chron: by default the root filesystem is checked every 30 mounts
05:25	<Roger_The_Bum>	lol edubuntu pwns all
05:25	<nefelim>	well i tried to install mandrake on one of my pc i find kde cool but revert back to ubuntu since i find ubuntu more user-friendly so i decided to try kde for ubuntu :)
05:25	<lysis>	Flannel: i think we should finish this dispute right now, once and for all, CLI is best.  bah on WM  =P
05:25	<Warbo>	chron: After a certain time or number of mounts or if you don't shutdown they should check on boot
05:25	<Roger_The_Bum>	</sarcasm>
05:25	<Roger_The_Bum>	but I am trying to get my brother on it
05:25	<intelikey>	nefelim better is subjective.   which ever you like, is always "better" than the one you don't like.....
05:26	<Viaken>	My philosophy is use whatever works for you, as long as it doesn't prevent us from worknig together.
05:26	<Roger_The_Bum>	it all depends
05:26	<Funkmon>	Hey, you guys, can you help me with a problem I'm having with the 5.10 LiveCD?
05:26	<Eroick>	i installed dapper. it comes with ndiswrapper module, but not the tool. where can I get the tool?
05:26	<lysis>	Funkmon: what's wrong buddy?
05:26	<chron>	so what would 1 2 mean for dump pass
05:26	<chron>	?
05:26	<Roger_The_Bum>	what?
05:26	<Flannel>	Bilford: it's a pity they got half of it wrong.
05:26	<Shaezsche>	if i disable my internal HD, and set my laptop to boot to an USB HD with the install CD in the drive, will it automatically intall on the external drive? or will i need to use a special command?
05:26	<nefelim>	well okay maybe i will try kde but if im not satisfied is it easy to uninstall it?
05:26	<Bilford>	Flannel, whats wrong
05:26	<Roger_The_Bum>	Funkmon, did you burn the ISO correctly?
05:26	<pike__>	nefelim: take a look at xubuntu too..
05:26	<Flannel>	Bilford: Canonical isn't SELLING support for X years.
05:26	<lwarimav>	intelikey, how can i install in a simple form RealPlayer10GOLD.bin????
05:26	<DShepherd>	i smell dapper nearing
05:26	<nhaines>	Eroick, install ndiswrapper-utils
05:27	<_nano_>	chron: the last column
05:27	<nefelim>	what is xubuntu? what's new with it?
05:27	<Eroick>	nhaines: is it on the CD? if not, where can i get it when im on windowsS?
05:27	<DShepherd>	nefelim: its kooler
05:27	<Eroick>	nefelim: it is ubuntu running xfce
05:27	<_nano_>	chron: the sixth column...it's the fsck column
05:27	<pike__>	nefelim: its xfce more lighweight
05:27	<nhaines>	Eroick, it is on the CD, yes.
05:27	<Flannel>	Bilford: well, they are selling optionally, but it's still poorly worded.
05:27	<Shaezsche>	xubu is supposed to be fast
05:27	<_nano_>	chron: if you set it to 1..it will check file system before mounting it
05:27	<Roger_The_Bum>	note: fsck!=F*ck
05:27	<nefelim>	ah okey
05:27	<supertanker>	hello. I have an Nvidia card with OpenGL support. In my other linux distro, I have the opengl driver installed and working, But in Ubuntu, when I install the driver and try to play a game it says it cannot find libGL
05:27	<_nano_>	chron: it's normally set to zero for faster boot
05:27	<Viaken>	xfce is nifty.
05:27	<nhaines>	Eroick, but pretending it isn't, you could go to packages.ubuntu.com and search for it under dapper, if you had to.  :)
05:28	<chron>	ok thanks
05:28	<DShepherd>	Shaezsche: fast-er
05:28	<intelikey>	lwarimav .bin files can usally be executed.   "sh file.bin "     if it needs root clearance use "sudo sh file.bin "
05:28	<pike__>	xubuntu under dapper is very nifty
05:28	<Shaezsche>	xubu has even worse hardware recognition
05:28	<supertanker>	do I have to enable OpenGL or something?
05:28	<Warbo>	lwarimav: I find the debian package of realplayer from nerim.net works fine in Ubuntu (I would prefer using debian packages than prorpietary vendors idea of an installer)
05:28	<Efnian>	cluehammer, it's timestamped yesterday
05:28	<Roger_The_Bum>	intelikey, would it be sudo -i sh file.bin?
05:28	<DaSkreech>	DShepherd: I knew I'd find you here
05:28	<DShepherd>	DaSkreech: Stalker!
05:28	<lwarimav>	ok
05:28	<K|NgGh0sT>	How can I stop Kubuntu from displaying LCD ON,  every 4 mins
05:28	<_nano_>	Shaezsche: hardware recognition is not done by window managers is it?
05:28	<DaSkreech>	DShepherd: Roger_The_Bum is not me :-)
05:28	<cluehammer>	close enough, it's not like they would put an rc out the day before
05:28	<supertanker>	well?
05:28	<lwarimav>	ok warbo
05:29	<Roger_The_Bum>	yeah
=== barros is now known as barros|afk
05:29	<intelikey>	Roger_The_Bum not if i did it....    i don't use sudo.
05:29	<Shaezsche>	who cares
05:29	<DShepherd>	DaSkreech: i didnt think so either
05:29	<lwarimav>	ok intelikey
05:29	<cluehammer>	31 minutes left!
05:29	<Strokerace>	anyone here that works on the live cd
05:29	<Viaken>	cluehammer: /topic
05:29	<Roger_The_Bum>	do you use su
05:29	<nhaines>	Roger_The_Bum, use sudo for everything.
05:29	<Josh43>	"Ok, pending Dapper release: Can anyone tell me if there is a way to test the mirror speeds and find out which I should be using?
05:29	<Funkmon>	Psst. Lysis
05:29	<intelikey>	Roger_The_Bum no su and sudo don't work on a system mounted nosuid
05:29	<supertanker>	I need to figure out how to get OpenGL working, I know my card is supported
05:29	<supertanker>	I installed the Nvidia driver
05:29	<Roger_The_Bum>	I dunno
05:30	<cluehammer>	oh i saw the topic, let me dream darn you heh!
05:30	<supertanker>	(that came iwth ubuntu). Do I need to enable it or anythuing?
05:30	<dr_willis>	Josh43:  thers some apt-get tool that can do that.. but i havent messed with it in ages.   but i imagine the best downloads will be with torrents (perhaps)
05:30	<Roger_The_Bum>	I actually don't use ubuntu that often
05:30	<Flannel>	!tell supertanker about nvidia
05:30	<muszek>	cluehammer: is it going to be out in 31 minutes?
05:30	<cluehammer>	no

05:31	<Eroick>	how do i set the CDrom as a repo?
05:31	<dr_willis>	Josh43:  ive found that  never works. :P
05:31	<keithg>	How is the grub bootloader reinstalled?

05:33	<_nano_>	Bilford: activation crack?
05:33	<Soir>	Bilford: just write the contents of /dev/zero onto every file, that'll nullify the control management
05:33	<nhaines>	Bilford, Ubuntu doesn use activation.
05:33	<Roger_The_Bum>	soir: this is a HELP channel
05:33	<supertanker>	I just forgot, what is the name of ubuntu 5.1?

05:34	<Warbo>	Soir: If you said that about windows then taht would be help, but...
05:34	<Flannel>	Soir: that sort of thing will get you banned
05:34	<Bilford>	Soir, THANKS!
05:34	<Josh43>	dr_willis; thus the hope of an automated tool that will spit out what I'm getting from a list of mirrors
05:34	<Roger_The_Bum>	not a stupid "ooh let's fool him with an rm -rf /"
05:34	<Eroick>	i got some 1337 h4x to get u d4pp3r for fr33 d00ds.
05:34	<nhaines>	supertanker, it's 5.10

05:34	<earthen_>	can someone tell me how do I do a force recognition on usb devices
05:34	<Soir>	I didn't even say how to do it.
05:34	<Roger_The_Bum>	become a jedi
05:34	<nhaines>	supertanker, that's "five point ten" ;)
05:34	<dr_willis>	Josh43:  theres some apt-get tool that can scan  the apt repos and print out a list of the lowest pinged ones and stuff.. but thats about it.
05:34	<Soir>	(since, someone probably would)
05:34	<supertanker>	ah okay
05:34	<intelikey>	argpirate id wate until dapper flys then if you still need to use the debian deb   use at your own risk.

05:38	<Soir>	word: buffer i/o error? Was this device working before?
05:38	<intelikey>	!tell keithg about grub
05:38	<word>	Warbo: I tried to run gparted and it told me i had a bad sector but then after running partition magic on my windows partition it checked nad said everything was fine when i gave my linux part more space so...

05:40	<Efnian>	Mixx, it's an rc.
05:40	<Soir>	word: That's little consolation ^^ What'd you do immediately before the problem, resize a partition?
05:40	<paradon>	DevilsAdvocate: Make sure you have Sun Java 1.5

05:42	<word>	Soir: PM 'might' have attempted to fix the error...I'm not sure if I went into windows and ran chkdsk prior to going into linux which tried to correct something..gparted just refused to partition anything because of the error.
05:42	<Twylo>	I think we're all dapper wanters here.

05:45	<pike__>	earthen_: well.. it might work by sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and going back through and setting up everything..
05:45	<cluehammer>	yar
05:45	<intelikey>	beniamino i can advise, that; there are some really good network adm's that hange in ##linux
05:45	<word>	No, regular one HD 80 gig 2 partitions.
05:45	<bkh>	Yeah, I know... grr...
05:46	<beniamino>	ok, will try ##linux, thanks
05:46	<intelikey>	np
05:46	<disinterested_pe>	virgins take to long to train
05:46	<[1] Troy>	hi.  i'm sure this hasn't been asked b4 - when is dapper coming out?
05:46	<NoUse>	!dapper
05:46	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
05:46	<[1] Troy>	heheh
05:46	<intelikey>	lol
05:46	<Viaken>	[1] Troy: Real Soon Now(TM)
05:46	<nbx909>	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185570
05:46	<Flannel>	nbx909: stop it.
05:46	<[1] Troy>	i was kidding.
05:46	<nbx909>	it;s out
05:46	<carlosqueso>	that means in 8 hours, 12 minutes :-P
05:46	<kaled>	it's not
05:46	<earthen_>	pike__, that could be a option
05:47	<Flannel>	nbx909: no, thats not it.
05:47	<KurtKraut>	nbx909, we garantee you it is not.
05:47	<Bung>	anyone know any decent gui torrent apps lighter then azureus? and not something like ktorrent that needs the whole kdebase.
05:47	<carlosqueso>	wait, meant 18 hours, 12 minutes
05:47	<ali>	hello guys, i accidently removed the top gnome panel :-(( how do i get it back??
05:47	<mcmahons>	Bung: the gnome bittorent one is pretty light
05:47	<disinterested_pe>	gwaranteed
05:47	<nbx909>	Flannel, really? it's seems to be on most of the servers and then it's appearing on others gradually so it seems to be syncing
05:47	<carlosqueso>	right-click on the other I believe, and click add panel
05:47	<Flannel>	ali: right click, add panel, then drag it up top, right click, add to panel.
05:47	<word>	Soir: No, regular one HD 80 gig 2 partitions.
05:47	<Viaken>	Bung: freeloader is...servicable.
05:48	<yappa>	are they going to put the torrent on piratebay ;)
05:48	<DarkTower>	nbx909: thats probably rc
05:48	<Flannel>	ali: then add the stuff back (the menu bar, clock, etc)
05:48	<Flannel>	nbx909: thats a daily
05:48	<kag>	yappa: piratebay was raided today
05:48	<wormsarm>	hi !
05:48	<nbx909>	DarkTower, no the rc is labeled as an rc
05:48	<Bilford>	yappa, yeah, its there now
05:48	<yappa>	kag:  I know lol
05:48	<Hisakasex>	wich is the parameter that indicates the directory where the errors and warnings of resources/software are going to logged in
05:48	<mecca>	hey guys... how does one install a PCF font in Ubuntu?  theres no /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/lib/fonts dir :F
=== _nano_ is now known as _nano_away
05:48	<Hisakasex>	?
05:48	<DarkTower>	nbx909: then its the daily, marked daily
05:48	<wormsarm>	where can I donwload wine? but I dont want .14 i want .13 and I only can download .14
05:48	<Soir>	word: anything else come up in error about it? or just the buffer problem
05:48	<nbx909>	DarkTower, it's not marked daily
05:48	<intelikey>	Bung try apt-cache search torrent
05:48	<yappa>	I'm just being a smart ass as usual!
05:48	<Efnian>	nbx909, the non-rc is the latest daily, check the MD5 checksums.
05:48	<Bung>	mcmahons: ill check it out, i was hoping for one that still let you select files within the torrent
05:49	<glick>	scuse me, i really dig the ubuntu icon set, for dapper, but are they avaiable in any other color other then puke orange?
05:49	<argpirate>	if you are already running dapper beta yoou should just be able to upgrade like normal aye?
05:49	<Bung>	Viaken: freeloader? ok ill look at that too
05:49	<DarkTower>	nbx909: if it was out would there be 900 people here talking bout when its coming
05:49	<jbroome>	aye
05:49	<intelikey>	 apt-cache search    is your friend
05:49	<Viaken>	It won't do what you want, though.
05:49	<Flannel>	argpirate: yep
05:49	<nhaines>	glick, what are you eating if your vomit is orange?  :)
05:49	<cef>	Efnian: and you expect it to change from the last daily?
05:49	<nbx909>	Efnian, where are the daily md5s?
05:49	<word>	Just that if I skip it with ctrl+c there are no problems but otherwise i get those errors when it starts up the volume manager..is there anyway to try and reinstall just the vol manager to see if that would fix it?
05:49	<nhaines>	argpirate, correct.
05:49	<word>	Soir
05:49	<Hisakasex>	wich is the parameter that indicates the directory where the errors and warnings of resources/software are going to be logged in
05:49	<glick>	nhaines, captain morgan and oranges
05:49	<jamesstansell>	wormsarm: sourceforge.net supposedly has archives of the older wine versions
05:49	<nhaines>	glick, thatl do it!
05:49	<Viaken>	Bung: I use rtorrent, myself. It's semi-GUI (ncurses based), and has always worked very well for me.
05:49	<majd>	Hi, i've already installed LAMP before but it was very messy and i want you'r guys' input, what's the best, easiest way to install apache2/mysql/php? (I don't want to use a prepackage like LAMPP cause that just complicates things later on)
05:50	<wormsarm>	and how I compile them?
05:50	<Roger_The_Bum>	so... let me get this straight before I go to bed...
05:50	<Flannel>	!tell majd about lamp
05:50	<Hisakasex>	wich is the parameter that indicates the directory where the errors and warnings of resources/software are going to be logged in?
05:50	<Bung>	Viaken, does that have file selection? ... ah its ok, ill just google it, thanks again
05:50	<majd>	thanks
05:50	<wormsarm>	is a tar.bz2
05:50	<Soir>	word: You could try that, quick scans of the web seem to think that it can sometimes become touchy about the size of devices
05:50	<Bilford>	Is Microsoft afraid of Ubuntu
05:50	<DarkTower>	the orange colour is awesome
05:50	<wormsarm>	I use breezy
05:50	<DarkTower>	Bilford: Yes definitely
05:50	<Viaken>	Bung: freeloader doesn't. rtorrent does, I think.
05:50	<majd>	Flannel, is it any different under dapper?
05:50	<glick>	i dont like it
05:50	<nhaines>	Dapper's Human theme is so much nicer.  I got used to it.
05:50	<Hisakasex>	wich is the main.cf (postfix) parameter that indicates the directory where the errors and warnings of resources/software are going to be logged in?
05:50	<Flannel>	people complaining about orange?  heh, first brown, now orange.  What color would you be satisfied with? ;)
05:50	<NickGarvey>	I'm dieing here
05:50	<glick>	would be nice in blue
05:50	<NickGarvey>	I can't wait for dapper
05:50	<intelikey>	Hisakasex isn't that controled by sysklogd and klogd    set in /etc/something......
05:50	<jamesstansell>	wormsarm: I think they should have debs that work in breezy
05:50	<dr_willis>	Puce!
05:50	<yappa>	Bilford:  I doubt it.  There's a lot of people out there that are Windows Addicts.
05:50	<nhaines>	glick, then use Clearlooks.
05:50	<Bung>	Viaken: good to know, thanks !
05:51	<Flannel>	majd: not that I'm aware of.  Might be small filename differences, but essentially the same.
05:51	<Bugs>	NickGarvey: don't wait then, get it now...
05:51	<Roger_The_Bum>	OMG PONIES pink
05:51	<nbx909>	DarkTower, it's not the daily look how the daily one is labled
05:51	<nbx909>	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/20060531/
05:51	<Efnian>	nbx909, http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/MD5SUMS
05:51	<majd>	ok
05:51	<Twylo>	I've been running the RC, and it's been rock solid.  Very nice.
05:51	<Hisakasex>	the postfix config file is in /etc/postfix/
05:51	<NickGarvey>	no the full thing bugs
05:51	<DarkTower>	nbx909: convince everyone else talking bout when its coming that ots here
05:51	<kaled>	tried man postfix?
05:51	<Bung>	SNAKES ON A PLANE
05:51	<DarkTower>	!dapper
05:51	<Roger_The_Bum>	when is it coming out
05:51	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
05:51	<Roger_The_Bum>	give me a utc time
05:51	<jbroome>	snakes on a MF'ing plane!
05:51	<Hisakasex>	yes I did
05:51	<majd>	!ati
05:51	<ubotu>	from memory, ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
05:52	<Roger_The_Bum>	I heard 8 hours ago
05:52	<Hisakasex>	but I'm confused
05:52	<NickGarvey>	thank you DarkTower
05:52	<_Grout>	what about 0:01 UTC
05:52	<Bugs>	NickGarvey:  not sure what you are referring to...i have been running it for awhile and it's brilliant - have you tried it ?
05:52	<Roger_The_Bum>	maybe
05:52	<mecca>	does Ubuntu not support PCF fonts?
05:52	<FLeiXiuS>	Dapper is out tomorrow eh?  Or...is it a specific time EST?
05:52	<DarkTower>	NickGarvey: wc
05:52	<crimsun>	release will be within the next 4-12 hours.
05:52	<Bilford>	it's already tomorrow
05:52	<Bilford>	it's 03:52
05:52	<nbx909>	DarkTower, the md5 sums match but it's named differently
05:52	<T313C0mun1s7>	So nobody that is good with Crossover Office isssues?
05:52	<paradon>	My wild-ass guess is 0700 UTC, since IIRC that's when Breezy came out.
05:52	<jaime>	nhaines sorry i closed the conversation i tried to fine you but  i cant so if you can talk to me on msn open the conversation again please
05:52	<kaled>	then try man postfix | grep -C 2 log
05:52	<steveneddy>	release of Dapper? is this MY time or system time?
05:52	<Hisakasex>	ok
05:52	<Roger_The_Bum>	all I know is, I'm going to leave at 7 AM ETC and I want a TORRENT
05:52	<Healot>	wait until Mark announce the release
05:53	<crimsun>	steveneddy: as of now.
05:53	<NickGarvey>	yeah.. so I think...
05:53	<NickGarvey>	I need to get my charger so I can keep my laptop on
05:53	<Efnian>	nbx909, i didn't notice the filename, interesting.
05:53	<DarkTower>	nbx909: THEN THEY ARE THE SAME
05:53	<rredd4>	Bilford, not here
05:53	<Phuzion>	Can someone tell me how to upgrade my distro easily with apt-get?
05:53	<ggilbert>	It probably is going to correspond to whenever the PR person gets up this morning :p
05:53	<steveneddy>	I just don't see it on the DL pages yet...
05:53	<DarkTower>	oops sorry for shouting all
05:53	<Viaken>	Roger_The_Bum: That'd be 12:00 UTC, so hopefully they'd have it out by then.
=== Roger_The_Bum is now known as RTB|Sleep
05:53	<nbx909>	DarkTower, that just means the daily build was the final build lol
05:53	<RTB|Sleep>	ok
05:53	<Bilford>	It doesnt really amtter if it's the final or not
=== CodeSmith is now known as CodeSmith|snoozi
05:53	<RTB|Sleep>	est? bien
05:53	<Bilford>	it will just download a few minor updates
05:53	<nbx909>	Efnian, yes i noted earlier when people were talking about it that the names don't match
05:53	<RTB|Sleep>	buenas noches
05:53	<T313C0mun1s7>	-Dapper will be released prior to midnight June 2nd in a timezone other than yours.
=== CodeSmith|snoozi is now known as CodeSmith|sleeps
=== RTB|Sleep is now known as Dapper
05:54	<DarkTower>	nbx909: sure
05:54	<rredd4>	Phuzion  apt-get distro-update
05:54	<kaled>	for finer grained logging, see ulogd
=== Dapper is now known as RTB|Sleep
05:54	<nbx909>	DarkTower, what ever we will see then
05:54	<cluehammer>	hmmm i'm hungry
05:54	<Bilford>	I think the only difference between today's daily build and Final Release is about a few megs of extra updates to download
05:54	<Phuzion>	rredd4:  invalid operation
05:54	<cluehammer>	apt-get hamburger
05:54	<majd>	I marked the xorg-driver-fglrx package to be removed earlier and i can't seem to unmark it..any idea why?
05:54	<Bugs>	cluehammer:  lol
05:55	<rredd4>	Phuzion sudo apt-get distro-update
05:55	<jamesstansell>	wormsarm: the archive has .12 for breezy, but not .13
05:55	<cef>	nbx909: no, it means htat the daily build and the final build produce the same binary.
05:55	<jamesstansell>	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6241&package_id=174803
05:55	<steveneddy>	would it be easier to apt-get dist-upgrade or wait for the DL...nevermind..I'm installin it on another partition
05:55	<Viaken>	# emerge dapper
05:55	<Viaken>	Oh, sorry...wrong distro. XD
05:55	<intelikey>	Phuzion sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list (change all breezy to dapper) && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && echo success || echo failed.
05:55	<JabberWokky>	apt-get install June 1st, 2006
05:55	<DrSpin>	Viaken: LOL
05:55	<nbx909>	cef, is that suposed to be possible?
05:55	<sloof3>	Viaken: The only true package management
05:55	<wormsarm>	i'll try .12
05:55	<NickGarvey>	hahaha
05:55	<cluehammer>	!lart sloof3
05:55	<intelikey>	hmm could have used sed and done an enline edit.
05:55	<cef>	nbx909: create 2 .iso files at different times of exactly the same data
05:56	<nbx909>	cef, well then that means the daily build was the same exact thing as the final build lol
05:56	<nbx909>	i don't see your point
05:56	<nbx909>	lol
05:56	<kaled>	if Ubuntu there's pacakge named 'moo' in apt repositories, how do you install it with apt-get?
05:56	<cluehammer>	apt-get install moo
05:56	<nbx909>	kaled, sudo apt-get install moo
05:56	<exclipy>	sudo apt-get install moo
05:56	<steveneddy>	sudo apt-get moo
05:56	<cef>	nbx909: yeah, but that doesn't mean the build process wasn't performed twice - once for the daily, once for the final.
05:56	<DarkTower>	cef: i wouldnt bother. he's in on a big secret, the only person who knows its out
05:56	<Flannel>	nbx909: no, stop telling people that's out.  It's not.
05:56	<steveneddy>	nite all
05:57	<nbx909>	cef, yes
05:57	<chapium>	steveneddy: gnite
05:57	<Viaken>	Phuzion: You could also do sudo sed -i.bak -e 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
05:57	<ChangerO1Sea>	hey... how long until dapper comes out?
05:57	<kaled>	hmm, it won't work
05:57	<jbroome>	stab
05:57	<cef>	DarkTower: meh. I grabbed that about 4 hrs ago
05:57	<nbx909>	Flannel, what am i ttelling people i having told anyone else after you told me not to
05:57	<Viaken>	That keeps you from having to edit it by hand. :P
05:57	<pike__>	ChangerO1Sea: 14 days
05:57	<cluehammer>	i bet mark shuttleworth just dumps his cvs every couple of months and that's the new release :-), the artwork is probably whatever his kids have got on the fridge
05:57	<nhaines>	! tell ChangerO1Sea about dapper
05:57	<nbx909>	they can look at digg
05:57	<ubotu>	nhaines: NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
05:57	<ChangerO1Sea>	pike__: what?
05:57	<nhaines>	!tell ChangerO1Sea about dapper
05:57	<ChangerO1Sea>	i thought it was coming out tonight
05:57	<OmniD>	lies
05:57	<pike__>	ChangerO1Sea: just kidding couple hours
05:57	<cluehammer>	nope, still in the closet
05:57	<glick>	so the ubuntu icons arnt available in any other color?
05:57	<intelikey>	Phuzion the fully automatic way.                                                                                      sed 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list >	sources.list && sudo cp sources.list /etc/apt/ && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && echo success || echo failed.
05:57	<Flannel>	nbx909: shrug sorry, I haven't really been paying attention.  no use, with this crowd.
05:57	<rredd4>	Phuzion -->	 sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
05:58	<Bugs>	hey, anyone use GIMPSHOP ?
05:58	<JabberWokky>	ChangerO1Sea: Your "tonight" isn't everybody elses.
05:58	<MTecknology>	What makes EMACS different from gedit?
05:58	<nbx909>	Flannel, that's why i was spaming it, i'm acually a very good irc user in smaller crowds lol
05:58	<ChangerO1Sea>	ok.. well its 1158 here now
05:58	<Flannel>	MTecknology: emacs is an OS.  gedit is a text editor
05:58	<cluehammer>	gedit isn't an operating system
05:58	<Bugs>	MTecknology:  asprin :)
05:58	<ggilbert>	MTecknology: Well, both can edit text. That's about where the similarities end
05:58	<Viaken>	intelikey: Was mine wrong? :P
05:58	<Healot>	emacs is old, cli-orirented...
05:58	<ChangerO1Sea>	so i have to wait how long?
05:58	<JabberWokky>	MTecknology: weevils.  And lots of extra keypresses.  Too much to answer in a line on IRC.
05:58	<Chobo-Mog>	hey, could someone explain what the differences are between 6.06 Flight-7 and LTS, please?
05:58	<OmniD>	gedit isn't an operating system?!?!?!
05:58	<OmniD>	MY LIFE IS A LIE
05:59	<Viaken>	ChangerO1Sea: However long it may take?
05:59	<intelikey>	Viaken no i just updated mine from the first time i answered.
05:59	<cluehammer>	emacs causes cancer, sterility, and carpal tunnel, gedit just does eyestrain
05:59	<Bugs>	cluehammer:  LOL
05:59	<dr_willis>	OmniD:  its not.. but emacs is. :P
05:59	<yappa>	I wonder if Dapper is already just waiting to go but they're holding off to build suspense.
05:59	<sloof3>	well?
05:59	<Viaken>	heh :) Just checking. I'm not a sed wizard yet, but I'm aspiring.
05:59	<DarkTower>	emacs is cooler
05:59	<sloof3>	It be 00:00
05:59	<Flannel>	Chobo-Mog: no differences, well, flight7 isn't the final release, still a beta.
05:59	<MTecknology>	JabberWokky, is emacs more of a programming tool?
05:59	<Bugs>	GimpShop ?  Anyone, anyone ???
05:59	<cluehammer>	i bet dapper is just a VERY belated april fools joke
05:59	<T313C0mun1s7>	but gedit is hotter
05:59	<DShepherd>	yappa: mmmm maybe
05:59	<crimsun>	yappa: no, we're waiting for the majority of mirrors to finish rsyncing.
05:59	<DarkTower>	MTecknology: yes more programming
05:59	<cluehammer>	nein, gvim
05:59	<bobessutio>	mirrors?
05:59	<Healot>	cluehammer: yeah a joke
05:59	<MTecknology>	ty
06:00	<pike__>	MTecknology: the only thing they really have in common is sucking when compared to vi :)
06:00	<Flannel>	MTecknology: no, they're both.  emacs has a lot of scriptability built in, which has caused people to go crazy and code everything in emacs script (games, browsers, etc).
06:00	<DarkTower>	pike__: lol
06:00	<JabberWokky>	MTecknology: emacs is a total environment, a la KDE or Gnome, but text oriented.  It has web browsers, games, pim software, quantuum mechanics tools, etc. (And I'm serious about the last -- that's what my fiance uses it for)
06:00	<cluehammer>	admittedly, i bet it wasn't just the scripting part of emacs that drove them batty
06:00	<Flannel>	JabberWokky: nah, it's an editor, just with scripting hooks.
06:00	<DarkTower>	JabberWokky: emacs is not like KDE or gnome, thats silly
06:00	<Phuzion>	Yeah umm, every time I try to do something among the lines of apt-get update or upgrade-dist, it fails saying couldn't stat source package list
06:00	<Bugs>	pike__:  incorrect, "vi" suck, "emacs" blows
06:00	<Flannel>	!offtopic
06:00	<ubotu>	Non Ubuntu support related discussions may be carried out in the channel #ubuntu-offtopic. Editor/Language wars are welcome there!
06:00	<rredd4>	cimsun, you said "we're"  are you part of the resyncing?
06:00	<brett>	Anyone know a good tool to convert AVI to MP4 (ipod)
06:00	<Ademan>	anyone know why i can only play one sound source at a time? like if i have rhythmbox up, nothing in firefox will play, and vice versa
06:01	<cluehammer>	lol
06:01	<ggilbert>	Someone did implement tetris in vim :p
06:01	<MTecknology>	is there any need for me to really learn to use emacs?
06:01	<bkh>	The icon for emacs is a kitchen sink for a very good reason

06:01	<ggilbert>	MTecknology: not really. It's a nice program that you could learn, but there is no necessary reason
06:01	<Ademan>	cluehammer: whats wrong with it? should i use oss?

06:01	<Chobo-Mog>	ahh...thanks
06:01	<cluehammer>	Ademan nah, you want to google dmix thouhg if you have breezy it should already be there

06:02	<Ademan>	i've got dapper... so...
06:02	<brett>	burner, plenty in windows... but linux converters seem hard to find
06:02	<cluehammer>	Ademan they stuffed esd on one channel and left another open, but some programs like to hog the sound device all to themselves
06:02	<crimsun>	cef: wouldn't they?
06:02	<Phuzion>	intelikey:  Yeah
06:02	<ggilbert>	What I'd personally love is a gvim with gnome-vfs support :p
06:02	<T313C0mun1s7>	gedit and emacs are the same: emacs was made because Stalman is a programmer, gedit was made because Stalman is a programmer - see, the same
06:02	<Ademan>	cluehammer: seems like just about everything
06:02	<Chobo-Mog>	I was just asking because I saw the flight-7 version online and I thought dapper had finally been released...i guess it was just the beta
06:02	<cluehammer>	Ademan dunno in dapper, isn't out yet
06:02	<rredd4>	does any one use a laptop with nvidia geforce 2?
06:02	<bur[n] er>	brett: you could try using wine

06:04	<bkh>	When Jack Bauer manages to rescue the duck?
06:04	<Viaken>	brett: I'm sure there's a way to convert it in Linux, but I don't know how. It would probably amount to piping a decoder to an encoder, tho.
06:04	<khermans>	knanand, /etc/hdparm.conf
06:04	<Bung>	i installed the bittorrent and bittorrent-gui in synaptic. but when i try to run either from term, command not found... any ideas??

06:04	<khermans>	eigenlambda, heh we're not really that nerdy
06:04	<rredd4>	crimsun do developers get an early release of final dapper?
06:04	<lightstar>	Vaske_Car, apt-get install apache2?
06:04	<pike__>	Vaske_Car: you mean like sudo apt-get install apache2 ?
06:04	<cluehammer>	dpkg -L bittorrent | most gives all ofthe files
06:04	<Ademan>	should dmix be in synaptic?
06:04	<Vaske_Car>	no
06:04	<eigenlambda>	i have all my stuff in a tarball
06:05	<Hmmmm>	windex, ya i guess i can wait. even tough im already running some beta of dapper i want the real thing
06:05	<Vaske_Car>	there is tutorial on WIKI
06:05	<jobezone>	rredd4: but they have to sign a NDA first!
06:05	<khermans>	Can i get an SMS notify when it is realeased so I dont have to sit in this channel?
06:05	<Vaske_Car>	but can not find it
06:05	<disinterested_pe>	im waiting for dapper till it hits my mail box
06:05	<eigenlambda>	and when dapper gets released, im wiping my drive and installing it

06:05	<cluehammer>	Ademan no it's a setup for alsa, google it I don't remeber the file to edit offhand
06:05	<ggilbert>	Hmmmm: If you're using the beta of dapper, just upgrade. it'll be the same

06:05	<jay>	\yup
06:05	<ggilbert>	Hmmmm: you don't need to do a hull reinstall :)
06:05	<Bung>	i installed the bittorrent and bittorrent-gui in synaptic. but when i try to run either from term, command not found... any ideas??
06:05	<T313C0mun1s7>	So if I am already running a fully updated flight 7, will it automagically update to final?
06:05	<intelikey>	cluehammer | most ?
06:05	<Chobo-Mog>	argh...this suspense is killing me.   I'm still using Windows, since the previous version of Ubuntu wouldn't install properly, but I'm hoping that Dapper will work fine
06:06	<tate>	heh, I came to see if it was going to be a midnight release:-)
06:06	<crimsun>	Ademan: no, it's part of src:alsa-lib (binary:libasound2)
06:06	<grv>	same here
06:06	<Vaske_Car>	it goes something like Ubutu! tell me about apache ...
06:06	<grv>	im disappointed:(
06:06	<Hmmmm>	Bung, try instaling azureus
06:06	<z4k4ri4>	Could someone /msg me when dapper is *really* out?
06:06	<Bung>	hmmm, no thanks
06:06	<sherlock-holmes>	wher is it gonna release? any ideas? just joined
06:06	<Hmmmm>	sudo apt-get install azureus
06:06	<JabberWokky>	tate: It is for somebody's value of midnight.  :)
06:06	<Bung>	going for lightweight
06:06	<jobezone>	Bung: See in synaptic, the files installed by those packages.
06:06	<ggilbert>	T313C0mun1s7: Yes, if you were to update right nw You'd have more or less the final version
06:06	<grv>	yes true
06:06	<knanand>	khermans: what shud i do here??
06:06	<pike__>	Bung: there is always utorrent under wine
06:06	<eigenlambda>	khermans: i was gonna do that when i installed debian, but i figured, i was never going to reinstall
06:06	<Bung>	jobezone: ok ill doublecheck
06:06	<DaSkreech>	DShepherd: Cool :)
06:06	<Warbo>	tate: That would be novel, a midnight release at 5:00
06:06	<Ademan>	crimsun: so if i have those libs i should be alright?
06:06	<tate>	I can't be too dissappointed, I can't install it yet
06:06	<K|NgGh0sT>	Whats the command to change owner of a file?
06:06	<eigenlambda>	khermans: i keep thinking, im never going to reinstall...
06:06	<Phuzion>	intelikey:  http://pastebin.com/750566 is my sources.list
06:06	<sherlock-holmes>	there is nothing in the update...just a pcmcia-cs
06:06	<Warbo>	K|NgGh0sT: chown
06:07	<crys>	The debootstrap program exited with an error (return value 1) <- during an install; anybody here familiar with what causes that?
06:07	<Bung>	pike: not interested in running an app for emulation when there are plenty of linux torrent apps, thanks though
06:07	<FunnyLookinHat>	man how much longer!!!
06:07	<Vaske_Car>	Ubutu! tell Vaske_Car about web server
06:07	<Hmmmm>	guys, anyone know what's the best way to backup mails in evolution?
06:07	<Vaske_Car>	something like that
06:07	<intelikey>	looking
06:07	<supyo>	how do you make java work with firefox using Ubuntu live?
06:07	<knanand>	khermans: i think all lines here are commented by #
06:07	<Warbo>	K|NgGh0sT: chown user file
06:07	<khermans>	knanand, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DMA?highlight=%28dma%29
06:07	<Viaken>	WHere does Evolution store the mails?
06:07	<khermans>	knanand, always search the wiki first
06:07	<jobezone>	Bung: see the ones in /bin or /usr/bin .
06:07	<Phuzion>	Alright
06:07	<T313C0mun1s7>	I am up to date now - I assumed that because of the code freeze I would see many updates, but the last week I have seen several a day.
06:07	<sherlock-holmes>	not anymore
06:07	<JabberWokky>	FunnyLookinHat: Stop asking, or Mark will trun this distro around and drive you $HOME!
06:07	<jobezone>	Bung: Also see ktorrent, it's excellent!
06:07	<khermans>	Viaken, .evolution
06:07	<Hmmmm>	Viaken, it stores them in /home/user/.volution iirc
06:07	<jobezone>	Bung: has built-in search of torrents. Fast. Excelent.
06:08	<Viaken>	Then couldn't you cp ~/.evolution somewhere safe?
06:08	<Hmmmm>	Viaken, k thanks
06:08	<Viaken>	Add it as a cron job if you want periodic backups?
06:08	<brett>	When you install a program  with wine, where do you find the program files?
06:08	<nhaines>	T313C0mun1s7, there was no code freeze.  :)
06:08	<khermans>	i always recommend separate /home !!!
06:08	<ggilbert>	T313C0mun1s7: If you're up to date, then you have basically the release.
06:08	<intelikey>	Phuzion no sources there.... hehhe     add a line like this "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main restricted universe multiverse"
06:08	<pike__>	brett: like /home/brett/.wine/drive_c/
06:08	<nhaines>	brett, it'll be in ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files
06:08	<sherlock-holmes>	any change in the ubuntu artwork?
06:08	<bkh>	JabberWokky: If he does, we'll sick Brazen Bandersnatch on him
06:09	<Hmmmm>	found a good evolution backup link:- http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/12/03/how-to-backup-evolution/
06:09	<nhaines>	sherlock-holmes, not in the last day.
06:09	<kambei>	I'm trying to use the wine packages (0.9.14) and I'm having trouble with openGL.
06:09	<T313C0mun1s7>	Why has the art kept changing - like serveral times a day?
06:09	<khermans>	kambei, cedega
06:09	<supyo>	java, ubuntu live, firefox - possible?
06:09	<nhaines>	T313C0mun1s7, they had an external professional artist doing icons.
06:09	<Bung>	jobezone: not interested in installing all the kde deps for that, going for lightweight, thanks though
06:09	<rredd4>	sherlock-holmes there was an update yesterday
06:09	<Phuzion>	Same problem
06:09	<jobezone>	gaim should highlight messages with our nickname. It's hard to see if anyone is talking to mee.
06:09	<intelikey>	Phuzion then update and dist-upgrade.....  but i'd wait the 6 or so hours till the release is out.
06:09	<Hmmmm>	when does xubuntu a la dapper get released? wanted to see how much faster it runs than gnome
06:09	<mnvl>	did dapper come out yet?
06:09	<kambei>	I'm not interested in using cedega.  I would just like openGL to work with wine.
06:09	<grv>	nope
06:09	<sherlock-holmes>	really?.... i did that...didint notice any significant change
06:09	<Viaken>	Not yet, mnvl
06:10	<jobezone>	Bung: ok, but you're missing out, trust me.
06:10	<rredd4>	mnvl read the topic
06:10	<JabberWokky>	mnvl: Yes, but you missed it.
06:10	<rredd4>	lol\
06:10	<Bung>	jobezone: this laptop will overheat, ive tried it before
06:10	<sherlock-holmes>	i heard the release is gonna be late today....
06:10	<Ademan>	crimsun: so, is "alsa-base" the package i want? because i've already got that...
06:10	<T313C0mun1s7>	Oh, and I went and changed them ;-(   [and the background, and the usplach, and the log-in, and the wallpaper, and the cursors, etc . . .] 
06:10	<Bung>	thanks again
06:10	<mnvl>	when it does will the same servers that apt-get update uses get hammered?
06:10	<jobezone>	Bung: managed to use bittorrent?
06:10	<intelikey>	Phuzion any change to /etc/apt/sources.list   MUST be followed by an apt-get update or equlevent
06:10	<sherlock-holmes>	donno who decides the precise timings...
06:10	<crimsun>	Ademan: no, you already have alsa; it's installed & configured by default.
06:10	<crimsun>	Ademan: what's the issue?
06:11	<Efnian>	Alsa-base are belong to us.
06:11	<Bung>	jobezone: no, there are all these btdownloadgui and stuff, but they give errors, i cant find one in /usr/bin that will run
06:11	<Vaske_Car>	What does mean command aptitude ?
06:11	<intelikey>	lol equlevent
06:11	<khermans>	There's not handicapped people in the Ubuntu logo -- guess they aren't really people
06:11	<intelikey>	i'm on tonight,,,, aint i
06:11	<Ademan>	crimsun: only one program can play sound at a time
06:11	<rredd4>	Vaske_Car  man aptitude
06:11	<crimsun>	Ademan: cat /proc/asound/cards
06:11	<Viaken>	JabberWokky: That's what I was wondering. :P
06:11	<T313C0mun1s7>	There are no Albinos either, would you say the same?
06:11	<grv>	color schemes can actually make the topic not visible:/
06:12	<grv>	depending~__~
06:12	<khermans>	T313C0mun1s7, at leats one leper or something c'mon!!!
06:12	<crimsun>	Ademan: use pastebin.
06:12	<Ademan>	crimsun: sudo cat?
06:12	<Ademan>	oh
06:12	<Ademan>	ok
06:12	<crimsun>	Ademan: no, as your user.
06:12	<Bung>	Zambezi: you around?
06:12	<lufis>	Hi. How would I go about filing a feature request for Ubunu?
06:12	<T313C0mun1s7>	How about a pigmy
06:12	<jobezone>	Bung: that's weird... did you install from the repositories? If so, you could report that as a bug in launchpad.net .
06:12	<nhaines>	Phuzion, don't change your sources.list file.  If you want to upgrade to Dapper early, then just run gksudo update-manager -r
06:12	<sherlock-holmes>	there is no new information....i waited for nothing...man i am tired...
06:13	<Bung>	jobezone: i dunno, it was in synaptic, so i presume it was from repositories?
06:13	<khermans>	T313C0mun1s7, nahh
06:13	<Phuzion>	nhaines:  Server, running Bash
06:13	<Ademan>	crimsun: http://hstuart.dk/paste/view.aspx?id=4692a175-ee06-487e-b8d3-a8aebd6cef18
06:13	<nhaines>	Phuzion, oh, in that case it should be safe enough to change the sources.list.
06:13	<T313C0mun1s7>	I want to see a logo with three white males, there getting rare you know.
06:14	<Ademan>	T313C0mun1s7: HAHAHA
06:14	<cluehammer>	lol
06:14	<crimsun>	Ademan: you didn't create /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc* by hand, did you?
06:14	<jobezone>	Bung, yes, synaptic, apt-get, install from your configured repositories.
06:14	<Bung>	roger
06:14	<Ademan>	debian is enough of an elitist platform to have a white pride logo lol
06:14	<matthew_w>	Hey folks, what is a program I could use to clean up the audio track in a video file I have?
06:14	<khermans>	T313C0mun1s7, yeah theres only one -- but seriously if its for everyone, there should be a homeless guy in the logo or something
06:14	<Ademan>	crimsun: nope, all autoconfigured
06:14	<Phuzion>	nhaines:  Do you know anything about sources.list?
06:14	<lufis>	Is there any way I could file a feature request for Ubuntu?
06:14	<sherlock-holmes>	dont think so
06:14	<nhaines>	Phuzion, yes, I do.
06:14	<jobezone>	lufis: register at launchpad.net
06:14	<JabberWokky>	T313C0mun1s7: Google "Pep Boys"
06:14	<crimsun>	Ademan: and which apps are you testin?
06:14	<T313C0mun1s7>	Maybe the homeless gut can run it on one of those $100 laptops.
06:15	<crimsun>	testing^
06:15	<intelikey>	Phuzion did you see my post ?
06:15	<lufis>	jobezone: done and done. What then?
06:15	<Phuzion>	http://pastebin.com/750566 did I do anything wrong?
06:15	<Phuzion>	intelikey:  I must have missed it
06:15	<Ademan>	crimsun: rhythmbox + firefox (flash plugin and otherwise)
06:15	<cluehammer>	i bet you could run it on the $100 dollar laptop with windowmaker
06:15	<intelikey>	Phuzion add a line like this "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu dapper main restricted universe multiverse"
06:15	<jobezone>	lufis: and file a bug report on the specific package you have a wish for (or first search if someone else has done it before, and comment on it, if you want).
06:15	<dr_willis>	cluehammer:  ran ubuntu on my P100 laptop with windowmaker. :P
06:15	<khermans>	Can we get a cell phone text message when the torrent is up?!?!?!?
06:15	<Phuzion>	Did that
06:15	<Phuzion>	Didn't work
06:15	<crimsun>	Ademan: flash is an awful test, since it's oss-only and hogs the sound device.
06:15	<intelikey>	Phuzion any change to /etc/apt/sources.list   MUST be followed by an apt-get update
06:15	<khermans>	Any SMS notification of Ubuntu release methods?
06:15	<nbx909>	khermans, you can use the daily build torrent
06:15	<cluehammer>	ahh windowmaker, the best 1993 had to offer
06:16	<cluehammer>	yar
06:16	<crimsun>	Ademan: use multiple simultaneous instances of aplay
06:16	<khermans>	nbx909, link?
06:16	<nbx909>	it's the same thing as the final build
06:16	<lufis>	jobezone: what if it's not a package, but a inclusion of a certain software?
06:16	<cluehammer>	as much fun as this is, i must sleep. night

06:17	<KurtKraut>	Vaske_Car, at www.ubuntu.com after a few hours when this version will be released
06:17	<Bilford>	the release isnt 0000
06:17	<jobezone>	lufis: ahh.. good point, I don't know that. You mean a package not available in Main, Universe, or Restricted?
06:17	<nhaines>	khermans, it's guaranteed, though, if you have a good friend.  :)
06:17	<FunnyLookinHat>	MTecknology: CST is -6 GMT
06:17	<KurtKraut>	nbx909, it is not. These files are not the final version
06:17	<MTecknology>	o, so Dapper is supported in this channel now?
06:17	<MTecknology>	LOL, I stupid
06:17	<nhaines>	khermans, if you're in the US, I'll SMS you.
06:17	<nbx909>	KurtKraut, yes they are....
06:17	<crimsun>	Ademan: yes, from the terminal. ``aplay /usr/share/sounds/startup.wav''
06:17	<T313C0mun1s7>	JabberWokky: http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~rvm/pics/pepboys.jpg
06:17	<Vaske_Car>	KurtKraus, oh so its still in developement...
06:17	<FunnyLookinHat>	or wait
06:17	<FunnyLookinHat>	I am thinking GMT
06:17	<jobezone>	lufis: well, first see if it's in debian. If it's already in, it means it will be part of the next release (Not dapper).
06:17	<FunnyLookinHat>	^_^
06:17	<Phuzion>	http://pastebin.com/750586
06:17	<IcemanV9>	MTecknology: CST? we're 6 hrs behind GMT
06:17	<Phuzion>	There ya go
06:17	<Vaske_Car>	How long is Server version supported?
06:17	<Viaken>	jobezone: lufis is gone.
06:17	<MTecknology>	ok
06:17	<crimsun>	Vaske_Car: 5 years.
06:17	<intelikey>	looking
06:17	<jobezone>	Viaken: Thanks!
06:18	<Viaken>	No worries! :)
06:18	<khermans>	Is Dapper officially out now?!?!
06:18	<IcemanV9>	actually CDT :P
06:18	<KurtKraut>	Vaske_Car, 5 years. Stop asking questions that you already know the answer :P
06:18	<crimsun>	khermans: does the topic say as much?
06:18	<onkarshinde>	khermans: Read the channel topic
06:18	<matthew_w>	Also, what the heck is up with sound in Ubuntu.  Every application is crashing like crazy whenever it needs the sound device, or, it can't find the sound device, so I have so start/kill ESD a million times before anything works.  What am I doing wrong?
06:18	<Ademan>	crimsun: aplay does work that way
06:18	<FunnyLookinHat>	matthew_w: are you using dapper or breezy?
06:18	<crimsun>	Ademan: then alsa & dmix are fine for your chipset.
06:18	<Vaske_Car>	crimsun, im a bit confused now... it say that Ubuntu is suported 18months..., is there separate server version that is suported 5 years?
06:19	<nhaines>	matthew_w, you should configure dmix correctly.
06:19	<khermans>	crimsun, no it doesnt -- ok so i'll change it
06:19	<zcat[1] >	Bah, it's been 1/6 here for over 16 hours already!!!
06:19	<FunnyLookinHat>	matthew_w: never had any issues liek that for dapper beta
06:19	<onkarshinde>	matthew_w: Instead of killing ESD everytime, prevent it from starting
06:19	<T313C0mun1s7>	Is that what my problem with Listen is tonight - I have to kill it every 5 minutes
06:19	<nhaines>	matthew_w, 6.06 fixes this problem in most cases.
06:19	<crimsun>	Vaske_Car: -desktop is 3 years. -server is 5 years.
06:19	<intelikey>	Phuzion drop the us.  maybe and try again
06:19	<MTecknology>	Could not download all repository indexes - http://people.ubuntu.com/~jbailey/snapshot/bzr/./Release: No MD5Sum entry in Release file /var/lib/apt/lists/people.ubuntu.com_%7ejbailey_snapshot_bzr_._Release
06:19	<MTecknology>	what's wrong?
06:19	<Ademan>	crimsun: then what do i do about flash? grin and bear it? or can i install oss and make it play nice with esd? or what?
06:19	<crimsun>	Ademan: install alsa-oss from universe, and use ``aoss firefox''
06:19	<intelikey>	Phuzion or add a nl.  or something
06:19	<crimsun>	and go write a nasty e-mail to macromedia/adobe
06:20	<DBO>	I write two every week =)
06:20	<Phuzion>	Same problem
06:20	<intelikey>	Phuzion that is not a sources.list error.  that is a network error.
06:20	<Ademan>	crimsun: what did you mean by the second part? is that... the command to start up firefox?
06:20	<Vaske_Car>	crimsun, how do I download server version??? I tried here http://www.ubuntu.com/download but it offer standard 5.10 version, it does not say that it is server version...  ?????
06:20	<khermans>	crimsun, it seems to be in that .pool directory!
06:20	<FunnyLookinHat>	Vaske_Car: try going to the links from ubuntu.com concerning the server..
06:20	<KurtKraut>	Vaske_Car, server version is for Ubuntu Dapper (codenome of 6.06)
06:21	<FunnyLookinHat>	if those don't work it's becaues it's not relased
06:21	<Phuzion>	I forgot to set my network settings totally
06:21	<KurtKraut>	Vaske_Car, codename I mean
06:21	<rredd4>	intelikey maybe Phuzion can use apt spy
06:21	<matthew_w>	Ah good, Dapper's out soon.  I'll just sudo apt-get dist-upgrade soon
06:21	<intelikey>	rredd4 yeah
06:21	<Viaken>	Phuzion: Then that might be your problem. ;)
06:21	<FunnyLookinHat>	but I want my ISOs now before i go to bed
06:21	<matthew_w>	Also - hey, will that give me ALL of the new stuff in Dapper, because, when I upgraded to Breezy, I missed some stuff that would have been installed had I used the CD's/
06:21	<crimsun>	Ademan: yes
06:21	<nhaines>	matthew_w, use Upgrade Manager.  :)
06:22	<pjw>	Will the new version of Ubuntu include a flash plugin for AMD64?
06:22	<crimsun>	Vaske_Car: it hasn't been released yet.
06:22	<matthew_w>	nhaines; where's that located?
06:22	<crimsun>	pjw: no
06:22	<Vaske_Car>	So 5.10 is still stadard version and new version will be called  Ubuntu Dapper
06:22	<Vaske_Car>	now i understand
06:22	<Phuzion>	How do I tell ifconfig what my router address is?
06:22	<crimsun>	Vaske_Car: correct
06:22	<onkarshinde>	pjw: No
06:22	<nhaines>	matthew_w, System>Administration
06:22	<Meshezabeel>	all you have to do is: apt-get dist-upgrade ?
06:22	<matthew_w>	Ah
06:22	<matthew_w>	Thanks
06:22	<crimsun>	khermans: To what are you referring?
06:22	<nhaines>	Vaske_Car, the new version will be called 6.06 LTS
06:22	<Vaske_Car>	crimsun, any idea when it will be released?
06:22	<zcat[1] >	what's LTS stand for?
06:22	<rredd4>	Meshezabeel  to hard for you?!
06:22	<onkarshinde>	Vaske_Car: Wrong. Once dapper is released latest stable version will be 6.06
06:22	<crimsun>	zcat[1] : long term support
06:22	<JabberWokky>	zcat[1] : Long Term Support
06:23	<zcat[1] >	Ahhhhh..
06:23	<czambran>	Seveas: any development on the release?
06:23	<crimsun>	Vaske_Car: sometime in the next 8-12 hours, most likely
06:23	<nhaines>	!tell Vaske_Car about dapper
06:23	<MTecknology>	There going to be a shit load of updates the first few weeks for dapper?
06:23	<Meshezabeel>	rredd4, yeah, it is a bit hard, I'm just glad I don't have to type sudo or something silly like that!
06:23	<pjw>	onkarshinde: when will it be?
06:23	<Meshezabeel>	;)
06:23	<zcat[1] >	In another 8 hours is will be 2/6 here !!
06:23	<nbx909>	for those who don't think that http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185570 is the latest stable verson here is a screen shot of it running in vmware http://kimages.be/share/87459560.png i
06:23	<intelikey>	i just was using hoary, and so i uninstalled ubuntu-base and did a dist-upgrade to dapper skipping breezy  and i don't reccomend that anyone else try that... but it worked well.
06:23	<onkarshinde>	pjw: Sometime today
06:23	<crimsun>	pjw: it's difficult to release something that doesn't exist!
06:23	<Bilford>	best guess for release time is in 2 hours 37 minutes
06:23	<Viaken>	!tell Viaken about dapper
06:23	<meddlepal>	Hey, when Dapper is released, just wondering what command I should execute to download and install? Is it going to be the same update-manager -d switch as with the RC?
06:23	<rredd4>	Meshezabeel  are you root, if not type sudo
06:23	<Viaken>	well that wasn't helpful. lol
06:23	<MTecknology>	!Dapper
06:23	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
06:23	<z4k4ri4>	Dapper will be released on 6:06, the question is in what timezone :)
06:24	<czambran>	meddlepal: you shouldn';t need the 'd' switch
06:24	<crimsun>	Bilford: that's pretty optimistic, considering our core-devs will still be asleep.
06:24	<nhaines>	nbx909, the betas have looked like that for the last two weeks.
06:24	<MTecknology>	lol
06:24	<onkarshinde>	z4k4ri4: Read ubotu reply
06:24	<khermans>	crimsun, guess i am wrong -- maybe Dapper will be out at 3:53 accroding to the .pool directories on the releases.ubuntu.com site
06:24	<ajax4>	Its 6/6 on the East Coast :)
06:24	<PrimoTurbo>	Can anyone confirm that .pool is the same as the final?
06:24	<Bilford>	crimsun, they should still be up partying
06:24	<ajax4>	Err, 6/1 that is.
06:24	<intelikey>	Phuzion why do you have breezy cd in that list ?
06:24	<Flannel>	PrimoTurbo: it's not.
06:24	<intelikey>	oooops
06:24	<khermans>	crimsun, since it seems to be uploaded very frequently around that time
06:24	<JabberWokky>	ajax4: I was wondering "East coast of *what* is 6/6?!??!"
06:24	<Flannel>	PrimoTurbo: its todays daily build
06:25	<PrimoTurbo>	I see
06:25	<rredd4>	intelikey Phuzion (i=Phuzion8@69-168-170-76.clvdoh.adelphia.net) has left #ubuntu
06:25	<nbx909>	nhaines, they said thank you for your interest in ubuntu released in june 2006?
06:25	<PrimoTurbo>	man this is annoying I see a thread about the final
06:25	<ajax4>	Jabber: hehe, typo!
06:25	<Vaske_Car>	Here is why i ask about server version: If i run server with 5.10 after 3 years I will not be able to update it no more, right?
06:25	<intelikey>	rredd4 see the oooops ?
06:25	<T313C0mun1s7>	I Know EXACTLY when it will be released!! I am just not telling (other wise what fun is being omnipotent)
06:25	<crimsun>	khermans: the timestamps from publisher mean nothing until the released is announced.
06:25	<nhaines>	nbx909, yes.
06:25	<zcat[1] >	JabberWokky: east coast are a little lagged at the moment I guess :)
06:25	<TiG4>	http://ubuntu.youaremighty.com   <--- This Is Great!
06:25	<Bilford>	Mark Shuttleworth went to the INternational Space Station
06:25	<nbx909>	nhaines, okay then my bad
06:25	<Flannel>	Vaske_Car: security updates, right.  You can still use it, and still upgrade it to a later version.
06:26	<rredd4>	intelikey oops...
06:26	<nbx909>	nhaines, i guess we will see when the stable verson is released if i was right
06:26	<rredd4>	lol
06:26	<intelikey>	:)
06:26	<khermans>	crimsun, is there a HOWTO on the release process?  Do they say what special testing is done to the final ISOs and things like this?
06:26	<Meshezabeel>	Dapper will be released on at 06:06:06am
06:26	<nhaines>	nbx909, the release candidate one week ago was an attempt to make a gold copy of 6.06, so, we have to wait until the announcemtn.  :)
06:26	<khermans>	to ensure like not major flaws in the release, like a bad image
06:26	<Bilford>	why is everyone waiting?  the final release wont be much different than the latest build
06:27	<KurtKraut>	TiG4, fantastic :P
06:27	<grv>	because it will be *official*
06:27	<Bilford>	you might have to download 2 mb of updates
06:27	<khermans>	Meshezabeel, that would be sweet 666
06:27	<ajax4>	Bilford: This will be my first time running Ubuntu, so I figured I'd wait for the final release.
06:27	<T313C0mun1s7>	Ok, Ok - it will be sometime after the thousands of hungry mirrors are done syncing, or just after you give up and go to bed (which ever comes last)
06:27	<Meshezabeel>	khermans, oh no, the end has come!!!
06:27	<jtd>	hi, guys!
06:27	<intelikey>	rredd4 you may catch me doing that a lot.  i generally lag several seconds do to using all my band-narrowness
06:27	<Flannel>	Bilford: most of us want to start serving up torrents, to share the wealth.  I know I'm not downloading to install, just to mirrow.
06:27	<Soir>	Bilford: ISOs, maybe?
06:27	<zcat[1] >	khermans: I think they should have delayed five more days, just for the coolness factor of releasing at 06:06:06 06/06/06
06:27	<bimberi>	Bilford: shhhh, you're spoiling their fun :P
06:27	<jtd>	can someone give me a brief rundown on how well the x86-64 version of Ubuntu works at the moment?
06:27	<nhaines>	Bilford, for example, the kids' computer is not connected to the Internet, so I am waiting for a final CD to burn to take over and do updates.
06:27	<Bilford>	ok sorry
06:27	<jtd>	(if the answer is "poorly," say no more ;)
06:28	<rredd4>	intelikey i see, i have a .1s lag
06:28	<rredd4>	cable
06:28	<paradon>	jtd: Not very, if you want stuff like Java, Flash, and windows media codecs.
06:28	<windex>	Bilford: this hardware has never run linux nativley.. i'd rather use something as polished as possible/
06:28	<khermans>	zcat[1] , anything is still possible!
06:28	<jtd>	paradon: good to know.  Thanks.
06:28	<zcat[1] >	nah, no more unexpected delays.. it's not vista!!
06:28	<rredd4>	intelikey would a different server help...
06:28	<Bilford>	windex, you like things clean and shiny
06:28	<intelikey>	rredd4 i can't speek of 'band-width' on a 28k modem.
06:28	<Viaken>	jtd: But you can run those things in a chroot, with varying degrees of success.
06:28	<khermans>	Vista looks pretty cool -- too bad it sucks
06:28	<intelikey>	rredd4 it's band narrowness
06:28	<T313C0mun1s7>	JTD unless you need TONS of memory access - stick with 32 bit, there are too many things still not supported
06:28	<intelikey>	:)
06:29	<rredd4>	intelikey  ok, 28k eye eye...
06:29	<bkh>	From what I've seen, Vista has nothing over XGL.
06:29	<FoX_44470>	Microsoft powwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ! ;)
06:29	<FoX_44470>	lol
06:29	<DShepherd>	what; keep the dapper duck so long?
06:29	<Viaken>	\o/ XGL rox!
06:29	<jtd>	I just sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'd when the last time I did it was a few days ago, and only 4 packages were updated.  they must be doing well.
06:29	<khermans>	bkh, yeah XGL rocks man, i love it
06:29	<jtd>	Viaken: what do you mean by running things in a chroot?
06:29	<Bilford>	whats XGL
06:29	<intelikey>	rredd4 only upside, i'm DoS immune
06:29	<Vaske_Car>	ok i am downlaoding 6.06 :)
06:29	<bkh>	XGL seems to work great for me, but Compbiz doesn't like me
06:29	<jtd>	T313C0mun1s7: You get no speed advantage from running 64-bit binaries?
06:29	<crimsun>	khermans: there is a testing page, yes. Some of the issues encountered are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseRadar
06:30	<Bilford>	does Kubuntu use XGL
06:30	<grv>	xgl, the 3d desktop
06:30	<Viaken>	Bilford: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGL
06:30	<Bilford>	ty
06:30	<zcat[1] >	DShepherd: it's tied up in duck tape..
06:30	<Hisakasex>	how can I check sent mail by postfix?
06:30	<bkh>	XGL is a new system that renders your whole desktop through OpenGL, so you can do all sorts of crazy things
06:30	<rredd4>	intelikey  how do you upgrade to dapper then, friends?  cd?
06:30	<T313C0mun1s7>	JTD only if the binary is native 64bit and VERY FEW are. Even then it is minimal
06:30	<grv>	like watch porn upsidedown
06:30	<grv>	on a cube
06:30	<Hisakasex>	what's the command to check sent mail by postfix?
06:30	<bkh>	Like wobbly windows, desktop switching on a 3d cube, all good stuff
06:30	<no0ke>	what's LTS?
06:30	<Hisakasex>	sorry for my english
06:30	<intelikey>	rredd4 that's what eat all the band-narrowness  :)
06:31	<IcemanV9>	!LTS
06:31	<ubotu>	lts is, like, totally, Long Term Support. LTS versions will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
06:31	<Viaken>	jtd: Trying to find you a link.
06:31	<rredd4>	intelikey  must take hours
06:31	<Bung>	has anyone here got opera to work with an application for opening files?
06:31	<Meshezabeel>	ah, thought it was Linux Terminal Server ;)
06:31	<jtd>	T313C0mun1s7: so on my Athlon64 I am much, much better-off running normal 32-bit Ubuntu.
06:31	<zcat[1] >	'late to servers' -- they delayed it 6 weeks...
06:31	<Vaske_Car>	CentOS 4 is suported till 2018
06:31	<rendo>	When 6.06 is released for download, does anyone recall from 5.10's release if the servers will be slow?
06:31	<haloe>	hey
06:31	<Bung>	i set opera to use qtorrent for torrents, but it loads qtorrent, and no torrents display
06:31	<P0ldy>	It's best to use a torrent to download
06:31	<intelikey>	yeah i let it run while i code or chat or what ever. rredd4
06:31	<zcat[1] >	I'll torrent it...
06:32	<haloe>	have you ever tried azureus or bitcomet
06:32	<jtd>	rendo: BT is your friend :)  and I don't mean British Telecom.
06:32	<haloe>	???
06:32	<Meshezabeel>	azureus is pretty good
06:32	<Vaske_Car>	How does torrent work?
06:32	<pjw>	Does the alternate version include a ncurses installer?
06:32	<IcemanV9>	torrent will go fast as everyone will torrent iso's
06:32	<rendo>	I know what BT is, I assume that means yes to my question. :P
06:32	<onkarshinde>	haloe: azureusis really good
06:32	<jtd>	BitComet is crap.
06:32	<T313C0mun1s7>	JTD: Here is my thread on my headaches with 64bit and why I changed: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=180600
06:32	<jtd>	Avoid it.
06:32	<haloe>	yeah :)
06:32	<Meshezabeel>	Vaske_Car, don't worry about torrent, you are already downloading 6.06
06:32	<P0ldy>	Yes, please don't use BitComet
06:32	<haloe>	BitComet is crap?
06:32	<zcat[1] >	how many bits could a bit torrent torrent if a bit torrent could torrent bits?
06:32	<no0ke>	when's it coming out???????????????????????
06:32	<rredd4>	gee, I love my cable internet!!
06:32	<Vaske_Car>	I do, it need 50 minutes
06:32	<cef>	zcat[1] : heh
06:33	<onkarshinde>	no0ke: sometime today
06:33	<jtd>	BitComet, last I checked, breaks private torrent protection, which causes some trackers to reject you when you use it.
06:33	<intelikey>	zcat[1]  forty five!
06:33	<bimberi>	no0ke: /topic
06:33	<haloe>	zacat[1] : how many bits could a bit torrent torrent if a bit torrent could torrent bits?
06:33	<jtd>	T313C0mun1s7: Molto grazie.
06:33	<z4k4ri4>	If you already running dapper beta it's better to use jigdo
06:33	<haloe>	copypaste lol
06:33	<haloe>	hahaha
06:33	<Meshezabeel>	if a bit torrent could torrent bits, the bits that a bit torrent could torrent bit if a torrent bit torrent torrents bits
06:33	<onkarshinde>	I am using jigdo. I had beta and then RC
06:33	<bkh>	Torrential
06:33	<intelikey>	zcat[1]  ever hear the expression "ask a stupid question, get a ....."    :)
06:33	<blanky>	Meshezabeel, where'd you copy that from
06:33	<pjw>	The alternate version == the old install version?
06:34	<pjw>	?
06:34	<Toma->	what does LTS stand for?
06:34	<rendo>	So is it released yet or no?
06:34	<no0ke>	!lts
06:34	<z4k4ri4>	pjw: yes
06:34	<ubotu>	I guess lts is Long Term Support. LTS versions will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
06:34	<haloe>	Bung: hello
06:34	<P0ldy>	BitComet also favors peers using the same client, and sends so many junk packets that you could upload 1.5 of a torrent and not get the full copy out
06:34	<T313C0mun1s7>	By the way for anyone wanting to know why NOT to run 64 bit this is a excellent thread: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=180600

06:34	<ubotu>	I guess lts is Long Term Support. LTS versions will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
06:34	<Vaske_Car>	will 6.06 beta bupdate itself to final version when released?
06:34	<Toma->	i c
06:34	<nhaines>	Vaske_Car, yes.

06:34	<haloe>	hey zcat[1] 
06:35	<OmniD>	oh sweet. I was joking but hey might as well do it.

06:35	<z4k4ri4>	pjw: yes
06:35	<Bilford>	mouse trails are the reason why I switched to Ubuntu
06:35	<jtd>	P0ldy: I actually didn't know that about BitComet with the whole "favoring peers with same client" thing.
06:35	<Meshezabeel>	yes, that's why most people don't want to switch to linux, because they lose the important things like mouse trails
06:35	<eigenlambda>	Viaken: it's not all its cracked up to be
06:35	<zcat[1] >	mouse trails? important?
06:35	<Bilford>	actually, I use Kubuntu
06:35	<sally__>	if the live cd has an installer, why should I not download the live cd?  what advantages does the non-live cd have
06:35	<jtd>	what's esspresso?
06:35	<JabberWokky>	zcat[1] : If you're visually impaired, they are.
06:36	<eigenlambda>	just get a coolatta-type drink.  those are good.

06:36	<Vaske_Car>	does anybody running Invision Power Board from home?
06:36	<rendo>	So is it released yet or no?
06:36	<intelikey>	eigenlambda we shoul code something called "mouse droppings"   that will leave mouse pills in the corner of the screen if the mouse is idle for very long....  :)

06:36	<crimsun>	Meshezabeel: dude, ponies are way more important than mouse trails, and vista has ponies, so I'm going with vista.
06:36	<orbin>	sally__: only the dapper live cd has an installer.  previous version did not
06:36	<grndslm>	sally)), the only reason you'd need to use the live cd is for an older computer...in which case you should try xubuntu instead of ubuntu
06:36	<jtd>	eigenlambda: I know that :)  I thought "esspresso" was a program.  Heh.
06:36	<Viaken>	eigenlambda: Well, I haven't heard any of the cracking up, so I can't be let down. ;)
06:36	<eigenlambda>	intelikey: eww!!

06:36	<bimberi>	sally__: yw :)
06:37	<nhaines>	jtd, the installer is called Ubiquity, not expresso any longer.  ;)
06:37	<Viaken>	crimsun: Ponies??
06:37	<haloe>	lol
06:37	<eigenlambda>	lol
06:37	<Meshezabeel>	crimsun, they used to think no one would ever need more than 64k of mouse trails, but no, we need more of them!!!
06:37	<Xore>	Ponies are so 2 months ago
06:37	<Toma->	anyone tried the kubuntu RC? is it rock solid?
06:37	<jtd>	I have a question about xfce on Ubuntu (xubuntu).  When you install packages, will apt-get install icons in xfce's menus the way it does for KDE and Gnome?

06:38	<Vaske_Car>	onkarshinde, what will be new in 6.06 comparing to 5.10
06:38	<DShepherd>	P0ldy: i like it
06:39	<shrewd>	Bilford: thanks for that, i'll wait :(
06:39	<jtd>	shrewd: general agreement seems to be "no."  not worth the marginal speed boost for almost all applications.

06:39	<jtd>	shrewd: I actually just asked a similar question :)
06:39	<P0ldy>	DShepherd, I prefer the runner up, but anything short of ponies is better than what it is now
06:39	<crimsun>	well obviously edgy will have ponies...
06:39	<Vaske_Car>	With Ubuntu 6.06 LTS RC comes many bug fixes, improved artwork, and general fixes all around.
06:39	<DShepherd>	P0ldy: the runner up is good but i like the winner

06:47	<jtd>	Linux STILL does serial boot-up
06:47	<Efnian>	Meshezabeel, actually, I have no idea, I'm playing it safe.
06:47	<GeorgeClooney>	i told the internet people that i had to have the net today so that i could upgrade to dapper, how sad is that.  they were very confused on the phone and told me that their internet service required windows 98 or higher and were utterly confused by the name dapper
06:47	<haloe>	Efnian P0ldy want to join you can get a much better conversation
06:47	<h3h_timo>	what is serial boot up
06:47	<Viaken>	!tell h3h_timo about dapper
06:47	<Vaske_Car>	well i just compare to Windows... im still in process to migrate to Ubuntu completly so i just want to know..
06:47	<bkh>	But isn't the matrix written in hex?
06:47	<jtd>	and if one thing is blocking, the entire boot sequence stops.
06:48	<bkh>	On those screens with the green letters...
06:48	<eigenlambda>	kinda funny...
06:48	<Xore>	;_;
06:48	<eigenlambda>	i guess the Matrix isn't invertible, then
06:48	<jtd>	h3h_timo: it means that, for example, if the boot sequence is waiting on an IP address from DHCP, nothing else happens while it's waiting.  the system just sits there and waits.
06:48	<eigenlambda>	if one of the eigenvalues is 0
06:48	<P0ldy>	GeorgeClooney, lol.  'What version of Windows is a Dapper?'
06:48	<rredd4>	will Canonical offer help if I email them a question?
06:48	<rendo>	I used to work for an ISP
06:48	<rendo>	We didn't support linux.
06:48	<h3h_timo>	jtd, it does that for anything it tries to do?
06:48	<rendo>	People got pissed when they called.

06:50	<GeorgeClooney>	P0ldy then they insult me with having a windows only setup... i am glad that my gfs computer has windows or i would have been very upset.  last time the guy came to set it up he was like "is this a mac?"  i said no, this is linux and he said oh that line x thing that i always hear about... ok
06:50	<T313C0mun1s7>	I use ubantu server with fluxbox on a 486 w/ 32meg - but there is a lot of work setting it up
06:50	<haloe>	?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
06:50	<JoseStefan>	well actually it's has an overdrive = 586/133
06:50	<rredd4>	JoseStefan  Damn small linux is great
06:50	<eigenlambda>	haloe: try "ph'nglui mglw'nafh Gthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn" for your next flood
06:50	<jtd>	h3h_timo: I dunno.  people make noises about replacing INIT with a parallel boot-up system of some kind all the time, but so far I don't know of any distribution that uses one.
06:50	<wims>	klined
06:50	<wims>	that's nice
06:50	<GeorgeClooney>	i am syco54645 normally by the way, i just didnt want to identify
06:50	<jtd>	eigenlambda: heh
06:50	<JoseStefan>	Nostalgia, it was my first PC
06:50	<orbin>	wims: he deserved it
06:51	<h3h_timo>	jtd, well... thats new info thanks for explaining
06:51	<GeorgeClooney>	but this is getting too chatty for a help chat, so i am out of here, back to my other apartment where my ac works.
06:51	<Flannel>	eigenlambda: is that klingon?
06:51	<DrewMarin>	woot
06:51	<jtd>	zcat[1] : doesn't help if you have wireless.
06:51	<bkh>	CTHULHU F'TAGN!
06:51	<jtd>	IA!  IA!
06:51	<Xore>	<noise type="random" source="camel" />
06:51	<T313C0mun1s7>	The processor is not going to be the problem - memory is the killer
06:51	<JoseStefan>	so I might have a chance with ubuntu-server ?
06:51	<zcat[1] >	I tell people I'm running a preview that hasn't been released yet. They go "oh, vista" and I tell them something like that.... they're going to be so dissapointed when they actually see Vista compared to my sweet compiz setup!!
06:52	<Meshezabeel>	bkh, get your batleth ready
06:52	<DShepherd>	zcat[1] : :-)
06:52	<intelikey>	klingoneese  don't you know?
06:52	<jtd>	zcat[1] : "compiz?"
06:52	<P0ldy>	GeorgeClooney, you shouldn't even have to tell them what OS you're using.  If you know the issue, just have them elevate you to tier2 tech support so you don't have to get the "do this reboot do this" shit
06:52	<rendo>	Anyone know if Cedega will support DX10?
06:52	<T313C0mun1s7>	I started with the base install, then custom, and started stripping out un-needed stuff
06:52	<IcemanV9>	JoseStefan: yea. try to install server
06:52	<DShepherd>	zcat[1] : i cant wait for edgy too
06:52	<hkl8324>	I checked shipit and it said the CD have been shipped to the shipping company on 31/5, what does that mean? The CD is the not final LTS or?
06:52	<bkh>	Meshezabeel: That isn't Klingon
06:52	<Xore>	oh no!
06:52	<orbin>	rendo: ask in #cedega
06:52	<Xore>	we're back below 900 people in here
06:52	<grv>	cedega probably doesnt even know if theyll support it:P
06:52	<rendo>	I'm lazy, can't you do it for me? :p
06:52	<Saj>	lol
06:53	<DShepherd>	Xore: yeah
06:53	<JoseStefan>	900
06:53	<zcat[1] >	I think I can wait for edgy.. dapper is pretty sweet already. Everything I need for a while anyhow..
06:53	<nbx909>	yeah i found the link early
06:53	<nbx909>	lol
06:53	<Saj>	:D
06:53	<Hmmmm>	when does xubuntu a la dapper get released? wanted to see how much faster it runs than gnome
06:53	<DShepherd>	zcat[1] : same here.. been running dapper from Feb
06:53	<nbx909>	well not me a friend of mine
06:53	<nbx909>	lol
06:53	<Hmmmm>	!xubuntu
06:53	<ubotu>	xubuntu is probably Ubuntu using Xfce instead of Gnome for the desktop. Details here: https://www.xubuntu.org
06:53	<zcat[1] >	Hey, I just found a torrent link on ubuntu.com for 6.06-LTS
06:53	<jbroome>	omg omg omg
06:53	<jrsims>	Hello! Anyone know how I can have drop-shadows in gnome?
06:53	<GianLuigiBuffon>	hi m8s!!!!
06:53	<DShepherd>	Hmmmm: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
06:53	<zcat[1] >	ummm no sorry, just kidding :)
06:54	<Hmmmm>	DShepherd, cool thanks
06:54	<troy_s>	jrsims:  Do a search for compiz / xgl
06:54	<DShepherd>	Hmmmm: np
06:54	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I'm running Ubuntu 5.05 Breezy and I want to upgrate to Dapper.... the question is... how? xD
06:54	<jrsims>	troy_s: yeah, is that anywhere near stable yet?
06:54	<jtd>	will sudo apt-get remove --recursive ubuntu-desktop eliminate GNOME for you?
06:54	<Xaero_Vincent>	900 people here? wtf
06:54	<majd>	where does php.ini install into?
06:54	<eigenlambda>	Flannel: no, it's what the Cthulhu cultists chant
06:54	<Meshezabeel>	bkh: well then go get me a shrubbery
06:54	<troy_s>	jrsims:  pretty stable for most.
06:54	<JoseStefan>	the are some unconfirmed links on the ubuntu forums
06:54	<bkh>	Meshezabeel: No, you'll just want another one.
06:54	<majd>	Xaero_Vincent, dapper release
06:54	<jrsims>	troy_s: I think I've already installed the packages. How do I enable?
06:54	<GianLuigiBuffon>	Cthulhu rules!!!!
06:54	<Meshezabeel>	:)
06:54	<intelikey>	jtd no  remove gconf
06:55	<troy_s>	jrsims:  if gl accellerated cards were open spec, probably more stable.  send mail to nvidia and ati.
06:55	<Fracture>	 /m
06:55	<Soir>	GianLuigiBuffon: With magical powers! And selective editing of /etc/apt/sources.list. Read the wiki for more info
06:55	<Xore>	Xaero_Vincent: 900 people in here is nothing. you should see how many people are going to be in #vista when it releases. (0)
06:55	<jtd>	GianLuigiBuffon: change all the lines that say "breezy" in your /etc/apt/sources.list to say "dapper."
06:55	<eigenlambda>	i think the GNAA is a kind of secular Cthulhu cult
06:55	<troy_s>	jrsims: let me find a link.
06:55	<Meshezabeel>	ni ni ni ni
06:55	<GianLuigiBuffon>	:O
06:55	<jtd>	intelikey: ah.  that makes sense.  all depends on gconf :)
06:55	<Saj>	dapper will be runing gnome?
06:55	<Meshezabeel>	ni
06:55	<jessy_>	where is dapper drake ? :s
06:55	<GianLuigiBuffon>	so better downloading dapper drake?
06:55	<troy_s>	jrsims:  try the wiki too.  here is the forums link http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=127090
06:55	<rendo>	It's not a question of how many will be in #vista, but more so how many people call in Microsoft because the OS fails to install properly. :P
06:55	<troy_s>	!xgl
06:55	<ubotu>	from memory, xgl is "XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/"
06:56	<troy_s>	!compiz
06:56	<ubotu>	Compiz is a compositing manager that uses OpenGL for rendering. See http://en.opensuse.org/Compiz -- Installation howto's:   http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems.
06:56	<rredd4>	zcat   made me look, lol
06:56	<Merturk_NB|hw>	will there be a seperate iso for xubuntu?
06:56	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: sed -i.bak -e 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
06:56	<jtd>	hm.
06:56	<Xore>	One of the big questions: What if Microsoft made an operating system, and Nobody Came?
06:56	<jtd>	I wonder if you can have KDE running on one facet of an XGL cube and Gnome running on another.
06:56	<troy_s>	jrsims:  enough?
06:56	<Xore>	s/Came/Cared/;      ?
06:56	<jrsims>	troy_s: yeah, thanks!
06:56	<Soir>	Viaken: mmmm, one line dapper.
06:56	<GianLuigiBuffon>	just that viaken?
06:56	<P0ldy>	XGL's exxxcellent
06:56	<Hisakasex>	how can I check sent mail by postfix?
06:56	<Efnian>	jtd, yeah, and XFCE on third and fluxbox on fourth.
06:57	<Hisakasex>	sorry for asking the same again.. I went to eat
06:57	<grv>	i dont think anyone knows hisakasex:(
06:57	<GianLuigiBuffon>	sed: couldn't open temporary file /etc/apt//sedGrD8Zz: Permission denied
06:57	<jtd>	Efnian: ... I may weep.  :D
06:57	<intelikey>	jtd yeah. you will need to renistall x-window-system-core   assuming you are keeping X    and  deborphan is your friend
06:57	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I'll put sude first
06:57	<Soir>	sudo would be good, yes
06:57	<jtd>	intelikey: "deborphan?"
06:57	<Merturk_NB|hw>	will there be a different ISO for xubuntu?
06:57	<rredd4>	will Canonical offer help if I email them a question?
06:57	<GianLuigiBuffon>	denied
06:57	<intelikey>	jtd yes
06:57	<Viaken>	Oh yeah...forgot my sudos. lol
06:57	<jrsims>	troy_s: wait, is this a memory hog, or mostly handled by my vid card?
06:57	<troy_s>	merturk: one would think so.
06:57	<Efnian>	Merturk_NB|hw, yes.
06:57	<DaSkreech>	DShepherd: 1000+?
06:57	<Soir>	Merturk_NB|hw: eventually, yeah.
06:57	<rob_p>	Hisakasex:  Probably by viewing Postfix's logfile.
06:57	<troy_s>	jrsims:  hard to say ultimately.  test and watch your resources.
06:57	<JoseStefan>	in theory, dapper should be released before the 2nd so we have 19h left (tops)
06:57	<DShepherd>	DaSkreech: its falling
06:57	<jrsims>	k
06:57	<Merturk_NB|hw>	Soir, eventually?
06:58	<grv>	lol josestefan
06:58	<jtd>	intelikey: why do you need that?
06:58	<zcat[1] >	sorry, only 7 now...
06:58	<Xore>	the 24h topic was up at LEAST 10 hours ago, to my knowledge, so it's down to under 14
06:58	<GianLuigiBuffon>	Viaken that command doesn't work... access denied
06:58	<intelikey>	jtd i do a looping deborphan to clean out all unnessary libs
06:58	<troy_s>	jrsims:  with novell developing it, i suspect it will get refined quite rapidly.
06:58	<Merturk_NB|hw>	Soir, easier to just install a server and run sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop ?
06:58	<nbx909>	no
06:58	<jrsims>	troy_s: yeah, I'm looking forward to it
06:58	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: You'll have to sudo everything: sudo sed -i.bak -e 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
06:58	<Saj>	interesting.
06:58	<JoseStefan>	well it's almost 05:00 GMT
06:58	<shrewd>	anybody used suse10.1?
06:58	<nbx909>	i tried that Merturk_NB|hw it takes for ever lol
06:58	<jtd>	intelikey: ... oooohhh.  You know, I have always wanted to know how to do that :D
06:59	<Merturk_NB|hw>	well, i've got a cable modem
06:59	<troy_s>	jrsims:   your computer will still work without wobbly windows ;)
06:59	<bkh>	shrewd: I am right now... which is why I'm looking at Ubuntu
06:59	<Merturk_NB|hw>	600 kb/s plus
06:59	<shrewd>	re:suse10.1: what did you think?
06:59	<Saj>	1 thing that will make ubuntu great is a cedega type thing built in:D
06:59	<Soir>	Merturk_NB|hw: That's what I did. I dunno if they're putting out a new iso immediately, I'd have -supposed- they would ;)
06:59	<jtd>	intelikey: That should be made part of some kind of "clean up your system" package.
06:59	<GianLuigiBuffon>	i pushed enter
06:59	<jsestri2>	what file would i edit to pass parameters to mysqld when it starts up with a new session?
06:59	<rob138>	are there any torrents of 6.06 iso?
06:59	<GianLuigiBuffon>	and nothing happened
06:59	<jrsims>	troy_s: yeah, I think I can do without wobbly windows, but drop shadows would be nice.
06:59	<GianLuigiBuffon>	is normal ?
06:59	<Soir>	nbx909: try upgrading from 4.10 in stages and then installing xubuntu-desktop ;)
06:59	<Saj>	but thats a dream for now:(
06:59	<GianLuigiBuffon>	or I must do something more
06:59	<troy_s>	jesetri2:  what are you trying to do exactly?
06:59	<jrsims>	troy_s: btw, know how I can check my version of xorg?
06:59	<nbx909>	Soir, lol
06:59	<troy_s>	rob:  yes.
06:59	<JoseStefan>	the ubuntuforums has "unconfirmed" links
07:00	<bkh>	SuSE has completely lost it.  The Developers treat releases like betas and Novell execs are forcing things like ZenWorks onto SuSE in a misguided attempt to boost sales
07:00	<troy_s>	jrsims:  what version of ubuntu you running?
07:00	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: Give it a little time.
07:00	<rob138>	troy_s where can i find them?
07:00	<intelikey>	jtd install deborphan and do this       [ $UID -gt 1 ]  && SU=sudo ;while deborphan | grep [A-z]  >/dev/null 2>&1 ;do $SU apt-get --purge remove `deborphan` ;done
07:00	<lin>	\q
07:00	<GianLuigiBuffon>	yeah but it finished at the moment
07:00	<DarkTower>	how stable will doing an upgrade from breezy be when dapper is released?
07:00	<troy_s>	rob138:  i THINK there are torrent listings at cdimage.ubuntu.com
07:00	<jrsims>	troy_s: most current dapper
07:00	<troy_s>	whoops
07:00	<DShepherd>	DaSkreech: what?
07:00	<troy_s>	cdimages.ubuntu.com
07:00	<rob_p>	troy_s:  Yup!
07:00	<intelikey>	you can script that.  i wrote it.  it's GNU
07:00	<GianLuigiBuffon>	now is working
07:00	<JoseStefan>	there is a rumor that the current dailys = final
07:00	<GianLuigiBuffon>	before it didn't request me the password and nothing
07:01	<rob138>	troy_s thanks
07:01	<jrsims>	troy_s: nm, looked at synaptic. I have 7
07:01	<rob_p>	troy_s:  Oops!  Wrong rob :-)
07:01	<GianLuigiBuffon>	so... when It finish, I'll have dapper then?
07:01	<grndslm>	does anybody know how to use flash memory as part of system memory, like vista does?  i gotta admit, that's pretty amazing that microsoft came up with a measly one new feature to the software industry
07:01	<troy_s>	guys, ubuntu is where it is at.  i believe mark has a few tricks up his sleeve regarding sun... we shall need to wait and see.
07:01	<bimberi>	JoseStefan: that's pretty likely
07:01	<GianLuigiBuffon>	E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
07:01	<GianLuigiBuffon>	 is this ok?
07:01	<troy_s>	the open sourcing of java soon and mark's response from the sun crowd was enough to suggest some back room chitters.
07:01	<eigenlambda>	No.  Using flash as system memory is stupid.
07:01	<jrsims>	so whats the news with Sun and ubuntu? Sun going to support it or what?
07:02	<eigenlambda>	it *will* destroy your flash
07:02	<grndslm>	eigenlambda, why?
07:02	<eigenlambda>	flash can only be rewritten a certain number of times.
07:02	<DarkTower>	grndslm: how much would that gain you? where does it say vista is doing that?
07:02	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: It should be. I get that error sometimes, too.
07:02	<troy_s>	jrsims:  depends on how you read it.  if sun wants to jettison the whole os aspect and focus on pure corp, it is an interesting situation... :)
07:02	<DarkTower>	wsouldnt make sense to use flash memory like that
07:02	<JoseStefan>	i rather have a ramdrive composed of DDR, but that's expensive
07:02	<grndslm>	DarkTower, i don't recall the site, but look it up if you'd like
07:02	<bkh>	It's an awful lot of writes, but swap gets re-written constantly
07:02	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: That said, proceed at your own risk. Ctrl-C if you want to stop it.
07:02	<eigenlambda>	using it like it's disk space is commonplace, because that's what it is like
07:02	<GianLuigiBuffon>	viaken  now appeared for update... with a large list of stuff that wont be installed
07:02	<GianLuigiBuffon>	no, it's done
07:02	<eigenlambda>	using it as main memory is stupid beyond belief
07:02	<chuck>	How do I setup Xserver to use system RAM as video RAM?
07:03	<Merturk_NB|hw>	well, this weekend I'm opening up a Tattoo Parlor running almost pure Ubuntu 6.06
07:03	<jrsims>	troy_s: think that's what they want to do? Make ubuntu their flagship OS?
07:03	<OmniD>	grndslm: for some reason that sounds like a really stupid idea considering the amount of writes are limited before the flash memory is useless
07:03	<Joetheodd>	Happy Dapper day! It's now 12:03AM CST!
07:03	<grndslm>	eigenlambda, there is no flash that can be written to like ram?
07:03	<Merturk_NB|hw>	minus one manager (my father) that is staying on Windows
07:03	<vinboy>	happy dapper day
07:03	<DarkTower>	grndslm: sorry but as you can see from peoples responses that doesnt make sense, may have read wrong or the site was bs
07:03	<troy_s>	jrsims:  I don't know.  But one would think that having Mark on stage has something to do with something.
07:03	<eigenlambda>	grndslm: it can be written to like ram...
07:03	<Merturk_NB|hw>	he just hard a heart attack, so I don't want to stress him out
07:03	<eigenlambda>	...but that's a dumb idea
07:03	<grv>	idk why they gotta be secretive on the release:/
07:03	<jet87>	Joetheodd: CDT, you mean?
07:03	<Xaero_Vincent>	why would u need Ubuntu in a Tatto Parlor?
07:03	<grndslm>	i'll take your guys' word for it....
07:03	<eigenlambda>	of course it's random access
07:03	<chuck>	How do I setup Xserver to use system RAM as video RAM?
07:03	<zcat[1] >	Thu Jun  1 17:03:36 NZST 2006
07:03	<jrsims>	troy_s: what presentation is this, and where can I get the video?
07:03	<grndslm>	i just can't believe they'd implement such a dumb idea then
07:03	<jsestri2>	grv: so they don't get bombed at a specific time
07:04	<eigenlambda>	ya
07:04	<DarkTower>	vinboy: happy dapper
07:04	<eigenlambda>	neither can i
07:04	<grv>	they'll get bombed anyway~___~
07:04	<zcat[1] >	dammit, we're running out of day over here!!!

07:04	<troy_s>	http://www.webaugur.com/dave/blogger/2006/05/sun-ubuntu-aha.html
07:04	<eigenlambda>	i think you read something wrong, or read something wrong
07:04	<leboff>	can someone link me that forum post?
07:04	<jsestri2>	grv: theres a diff between a huge load, and a huge load instantly
07:04	<troy_s>	jrsims:  try that for a few quotes.
07:04	<GianLuigiBuffon>	Now i'm on synaptics upgrading
07:04	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I hope to do it well
07:04	<GianLuigiBuffon>	xD
07:04	<troy_s>	jrsims:  google will yield many more.
07:04	<vinboy>	should I get a p4 or amd64?
07:04	<jrsims>	sweet
07:04	<vinboy>	i don't do much gaming
07:04	<troy_s>	vinboy: amd
07:04	<spartas>	joetheodd: Central Daylight Time
07:04	<DarkTower>	how stable is doing an upgrade from breezy when dapper is out??
07:04	<Efnian>	vinboy, amd
07:04	<jet87>	CST would be an hour back from what it is right now, i'm from around chicago and its just after 12
07:04	<vinboy>	ok
07:04	<grndslm>	get a core duo
07:04	<troy_s>	vinboy:  check how they support open source
07:04	<GianLuigiBuffon>	is going to download 1600 files... is that ok?????
07:04	<IcemanV9>	Joetheodd: Central Daylight Time (CDT)
07:04	<troy_s>	vinboy:  and intel is closed closed closed.
07:05	<DarkTower>	vinboy: amd
07:05	<vinboy>	troy_s: oh ic
07:05	<Viaken>	brb
=== chuck is now known as Shadow_mil
07:05	<GianLuigiBuffon>	1165
07:05	<Saj>	vinboy: amd64 is better....get x2 though
07:05	<troy_s>	vinboy:  and now in bed with the worst of all closed companies:  apple.
07:05	<vinboy>	sounds good to me
07:05	<vinboy>	Saj: x2 is expensive :(
07:05	<troy_s>	vinboy:  you WONT be dissapointed.  get an x2
07:05	<leboff>	can some one give me that forum with the links to the distros?
07:05	<grndslm>	distrowatch.com
07:05	<JoseStefan>	vinboy: wait for Conroe "Core Duo 2" to be released, compare to AMD's AM2 socket, then decide
07:05	<jsestri2>	anyone here interested in fixing a problem and not just blabbing about the release?
07:05	<DarkTower>	troy_s: i like amd much better, but how is intel closed?? I find whenever i want something to work with ubuntu i use original intel and all is fine
07:05	<grv>	core duo is very good too
07:05	<troy_s>	vinboy:  naw... don't even try to compare the x2 to the cheapo "core Duo(tm)(c)(blah)"
07:05	<crimsun>	jsestri2: shoot.
07:05	<grndslm>	core duo!
07:05	<paradon>	Re: Windows Vista and Flash : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperFetch
07:05	<Joetheodd>	spartas, IcemanV9, I may be wrong but at least I'm not politically correct. ^_^
07:05	<troy_s>	darktower:  do some research.
07:05	<vinboy>	ic
07:05	<grndslm>	that's it
07:05	<grv>	u can compare them
07:05	<grv>	benchmarks
07:06	<Merturk_NB|hw>	to bad I won't get all these cool features on my 500 mhz machine :-/
07:06	<troy_s>	darktower:  amd actively supports the open source movement.
07:06	<vinboy>	ok i prolly go check out the x2 then, thanks guys
07:06	<Saj>	vinboy: i know but 1 3200 x2 is wquivilant of 2 3200 64s...
07:06	<jsestri2>	crimsun: ah, great, i'm trying to pass some parameters to mysqld when it starts up...point me in the direction of where those go?
07:06	<GianLuigiBuffon>	viaken all that stuff is ok? The 1160 files from synaptics and all of that?
07:06	<zcat[1] >	Merturk_NB|hw: I ran compiz on a 500 with an earlyish nvidia cark.. not great but surprisingly geed..
07:06	<vinboy>	by the way, do u guys run 64bit ubuntu? if not, what is the gain of getting an amd64 cpu?
07:06	<zcat[1] >	*good
07:06	<DShepherd>	Merturk_NB|hw: nope.. not a chance :-)
07:06	<crimsun>	jsestri2: /etc/init.d/mysql
07:06	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I've marken all upgrades (it requested it for updating)=
07:06	<DShepherd>	Merturk_NB|hw: and if you do.. it wont be worth it
07:06	<DarkTower>	troy_s: sorry thats not much of an argument, And saying amd supports open source doesnt mean intel is closed, one doesnt follow from the other. As i said i like amd better, but unless you can give an example of how closed intel is that doesnt make sense
07:07	<vinboy>	Saj: wow, tat sound amazing!
07:07	<Saj>	64bit cpu is a difrent asepct of the thing
07:07	<jet87>	i'm trying to figure out if i want to do a ubuntu install on the core duo laptop i'm getting, or just run it with vmware as a hypervisor in xp
07:07	<tempname>	!grub
07:07	<ubotu>	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GrubHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or troubleshooting grub: http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#Troubleshooting
07:07	<jsestri2>	crimsun: thanks a bunch.
07:07	<JoseStefan>	64bit is the future
07:07	<troy_s>	darktower:  do your homework
07:07	<spartas>	joetheodd, not trying to be politically correct; there is a difference (CDT is UTC-5, CST is UTC-6)
07:07	<Efnian>	vinboy, all amd's are 64-bit nowadays.
07:07	<troy_s>	darktower:  that's all i will say.
07:07	<intelikey>	hmmmm i may hook two mother boards togather via the ide cable.....
07:07	<grv>	lol
07:07	<JoseStefan>	intelikey, no
07:07	<maruchan>	man i have a question that still cant get answered i'm trying to get my system back up, i uninstalled xorg, and now the x is broken, and when i try to install xorg-driver-fglrx
07:07	<intelikey>	JoseStefan yeah
07:07	<bkh>	I fried a scsi cable that way once...
07:07	<DarkTower>	troy_s: lol sorry. if you actual knew something you'd give a reason. Its like if i yelled out the sky is red, do your research thats why. You would have an example
07:07	<jet87>	i hear enough about time zones living in indiana, they're a touchy subject for me
07:08	<maruchan>	but i cant cuase it says it wants to change  diffrent file and its not allowed
07:08	<jbroome>	purple is better than brown
07:08	<Efnian>	I keep a safe distance to all time zones.
07:08	<grndslm>	jet87, i don't have a core duo, but intel is extremely open and smp support has worked with linux forever....apparently linux runs quicker than os x on the macbooks
07:08	<crimsun>	jbroome: omg ponies.
07:08	<paradizelos1>	CST is -6 hours, so 12 midnight is 0600 UTC
07:08	<bkh>	It was the coolest cable fry... the one of the fifty wires fried, right in the center, cutting the cable in half lengthwise...
07:08	<troy_s>	darktower:  theo and all have more than talked enough about intel...
07:09	<axion`>	ive heard xp runs games better than osx on certain macs
07:09	<JoseStefan>	Edgy should default to hot pink colors
07:09	<maruchan>	any help on my problem
07:09	<nbx909>	JoseStefan, lol
07:09	<jbroome>	crimsun: ponies made from puppies
07:09	<bkh>	It was a misguided attempt at making a scsi drive visible by two different computers at the same time back in college...
07:09	<jet87>	the core duos support VT, and googling around vmware can run as a hypervisor (like xen).  i would flat out install ubuntu if i didn't have to worry about dell hell and not fubaring the rest of the special partitions
07:09	<nbx909>	JoseStefan, anything but this stupid brown-orange color
07:09	<Saj>	vinboy: you see the the chip actualy works 32bit, every single part of it, but every bufer has 32 bits extra and if there is something above 32 bits that particuler buffer thingi switches to 64bit....so its basicly two things in one..the amd core is clocked slower, this is better because it makes less heat and thus is more overclockable, the other advantage is the memory controller which is on the chip, this optimises the ram and thus makes the system mroe e
07:09	<Saj>	fficient and faster.
07:09	<DarkTower>	troy_s: ok do your homework
07:10	<nbx909>	i have to install bluecurve every time
07:10	<nbx909>	lol
07:10	<varsendaggr>	hey when will dapper be officially relaesed
07:10	<axion`>	orange brown is the ubuntu colors tho
07:10	<intelikey>	bkh heh
07:10	<nbx909>	varsendaggr, we don't know
07:10	<varsendaggr>	now now now
07:10	<rendo>	varsendahhr soon!
07:10	<grv>	lol
07:10	<varsendaggr>	i heard tomarrow
07:10	<rendo>	Ef off keyboard.
07:10	<varsendaggr>	it looks cool
07:10	<axion`>	less that 24hrs, a little bird told me
07:10	<bkh>	Real Soon Now(tm)
07:10	<axion`>	than*
07:10	<grv>	rumor is that the daily builds arent going to differ from the official:/
07:10	<jbroome>	varsendaggr: it's tomorrow now
07:10	<nbx909>	varsendaggr, but you can download what we think is the final verson http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185570
07:10	<axion`>	grv, how far back?
07:10	<axion`>	just todays?
07:10	<JoseStefan>	less than 16:50:00
07:11	<grv>	i guess
07:11	<axion`>	well, im not good enough yet to tell whether or not, so no use trying
07:11	<Saj>	eta = 7hrs aprox then:D
07:11	<vinboy>	thanks Saj
07:11	<grv>	hey anyone use WUSB54G on ubuntu?
07:11	<Saj>	vinboy: pleasure
07:11	<reXin>	anybody know if dapper will have an option for an EFI supported boot loader instead of grub?
07:12	<jtd>	!automatix
07:12	<ubotu>	hmm... automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
07:12	<rendo>	Oh well, I'll head to bed and hopefully she's "officially" out in the morning for the awesome installage and the orgasmic bliss of DD.
07:12	<paradizelos1>	reXin: if it doesn't have it now, it won't be in the final release
07:12	<paradizelos1>	possibly an update
07:12	<rendo>	Interesting.
07:12	<Hentai_Jeff>	why am I tempted to send ubuntu disks to everyone I know an address for? :D
07:12	<rendo>	Subliminal messages with the name Dapper Drake.
07:12	<nbx909>	lol
07:12	<Hentai_Jeff>	and yes new dapper CDs of coarse
07:12	<rendo>	You want a handful of awesome OS.  Get DD, they're just like big titties!
07:13	<troy_s>	grv:  what's your question specifically?
07:13	<jet87>	lol
07:13	<jbroome>	whoah, we're all anxiously awaiting our double D's
07:13	<rendo>	Haha.
07:13	<reXin>	last i tried was flight 5... got my fingers crossed though
07:13	<grv>	no just wondering, did u get it working easily?
07:13	<Saj>	me gots a suspicion the dapper is ready, being uploaded as we speak:D........may be the deadline is a co ordination thing? ie make all the mirors, update all the sites, everything on same time?
07:13	<axion`>	i pine for DD's
07:13	<grv>	havent tried it yet
07:13	<JoseStefan>	i started with dapper Flight5
07:13	<troy_s>	grv:  multiple release versions i think with different chips... let me find a link.
07:13	<Shotgun>	hey, I need to find out how much ram there is on a machine running ubuntu, i have sshed to it using putty, so it will have to be through cmdlines, thx in advance
07:13	<rendo>	Well, until I get the official DD, I'll go molest my wife's DD wihle she sleeps. :P
07:13	<grv>	ya i got links and stuff troy_s
07:13	<jbroome>	i'm going to bed to dream of DD's.  night all
07:13	<axion`>	well from a collaborative standpoint, everything had to have been compiled when the 24 deadline came up
07:13	<nbx909>	Shotgun, free -m will tell you how much
07:14	<reXin>	dito. later
07:14	<nbx909>	Shotgun, that's in mb
07:14	<maruchan>	man i have a question that still cant get answered i'm trying to get my system back up, i uninstalled xorg, and now the x is broken, and when i try to install xorg-driver-fglrx, any help?
07:14	<troy_s>	grv:  i think it ultimately depends on what chip is driving it.
07:14	<wims>	do you think ndiswrapper will work after a dist upgrade?
07:14	<troy_s>	grv:  and if the idiots would just open there specs, we wouldn't be having this discussion.
07:14	<paradizelos1>	maruchan: i'm sorry to sound like an ass, but xorg IS the X system
07:14	<rendo>	Maybe I shouldn't have mentoned the correlation with Dapper Drake and Double D. :P
07:14	<grv>	lol
07:14	<wims>	i'm guessing..... no
07:14	<orbin>	maruchan: how did you uninstall xorg?
07:14	<jet87>	my "little" BB install got seriously fubared by xen after an update
07:14	<rendo>	All you uber nerds with no girlfriends will probably go and download porn now. :/
07:15	<Shotgun>	thx
07:15	<troy_s>	maruchan:  you will need some form of Xwindows to run a gui
07:15	<axion`>	my gf is sitting behind me for the record
07:15	<maruchan>	i know
07:15	<Unenvarjo>	good morning
07:15	<Hentai_Jeff>	rendo:what about us uber geeks with a wife and kids?
07:15	<troy_s>	maruchan:  which means removing xorg was not so good
07:15	<ray__>	hello all, will someone please help me with twinview? i've tried seemingly all howtos, tutorials, etc. with no success
07:15	<rendo>	Same boat as me Jeff?
07:15	<maruchan>	 but but when i try to reinstall xorg again, i get errors
07:15	<troy_s>	maruchan:  but not the end of the world.
07:15	<wims>	who needs a gf when you got a hand :D
07:15	<rendo>	Go molest the wife while she sleeps :P
07:15	<maruchan>	something about replacing a file, and not being allowed
07:15	<rendo>	It's always a surprise what she says.
07:15	<troy_s>	ray:  issue?
07:15	<grv>	did u do it as root?
07:15	<grv>	~___~
07:15	<Hentai_Jeff>	got 2 boys
07:15	<troy_s>	maruchan:  boot to recovery mode, and try from there.
07:16	<jayb>	hey guys... anyone here got ununtu-server running on IBM XSeries hardware ?
07:16	<Hentai_Jeff>	one's nearly 4 months
07:16	<maruchan>	did that already too no go
07:16	<rendo>	Oldest is how old?
07:16	<spartas>	who needs a hand, i'm sure not volunteering mine
07:16	<rendo>	I have 2 boys too.
07:16	<ray__>	troy_s, yes, i cannot get the TV to display anything
07:16	<Hentai_Jeff>	the other's nearly 4 years
07:16	<rendo>	15 months and 3 months.
07:16	<Hentai_Jeff>	he's a stepson though
07:16	<rendo>	Ah.
07:16	<troy_s>	maruchan:  well you will need to give us a little more information.. .like exact errors etc using pastebin.
07:16	<axion`>	is it possible to liveboot and copy the live xorg to your install?
07:16	<Viaken>	jay,dr18
07:16	<rendo>	They're fun. :D
07:16	<Hentai_Jeff>	and I'm planing to start him on the road to geekdom soon
07:16	<Hentai_Jeff>	:D
07:16	<troy_s>	ray:  have you tried the wiki?
07:16	<rendo>	People always tell me "You got your hands full"
07:16	<JoseStefan>	T minus 3284 minutes
07:17	<rendo>	I don't think they know what they're talking about.
07:17	<rendo>	IT's pretty easy actually.
07:17	<maruchan>	i get this error "dpkg rename invlolves overwriting '/usr/lib/libGL.so.1' with
07:17	<maruchan>	diffrent file 'usr/lib/fglrx/libGL.so.1.xlibmesa',
07:17	<maruchan>	not allowed"
07:17	<rendo>	Mione already is a nerd.
07:17	<Hentai_Jeff>	yeah I was scared as hell before my wife had our lil man
07:17	<axion`>	rendo, those kids are timebombs, you get them firgured out, then they turn 2
07:17	<axion`>	=)
07:17	<rendo>	Oldest anyways.  He plays the PS2 and knows how to turn on the PC and the monitor.
07:17	<Saj>	maruchan: of your looking to salvage files? then get a livecd which has ability to access the HDDs, as per my very limited linux knowledge i only know of PClinuxOS (my first full linux conversion...bin abt 3 days lol), but there are more such live CDs. once your booted salvage what you can;), in windows there is a emergency recovery disk, basicly has all the essentials and if something brakes, you boot via the erd and it patches he broken bits....there must
07:17	<Saj>	be something like this on linux? if not i think if you know what ned to be mended then grab a live cd which has a: can access to the drives and b: able to access internet and fix the files manualy;)
07:17	<troy_s>	maruchan: what is the command that you did that fubard your x?
07:17	<jayb>	Viaken - what do you mean ?? what is dr18 ?
07:17	<rendo>	WEll he doesn't play the PS2, he button mashes. :P
07:17	<K|NgGh0sT>	what does ubuntu make the rootpass to be?
07:17	<maruchan>	fubard?
07:17	<Hentai_Jeff>	but I'm about to start my oldest on linux :D
07:18	<Flannel>	!tell K|NgGh0sT about root
07:18	<grv>	button mashing is a skill
07:18	<rendo>	Awesome. :)
07:18	<troy_s>	maruchan:  dun broken it.
07:18	<intelikey>	free needs work.....
07:18	<DShepherd>	where is dapper :-(?
07:18	<rendo>	My wife REFUSES to even try Ubuntu.
07:18	<intelikey>	echo "`free -m | grep -e '-/+' | cut -b31- | tr -d ' '`m free"
07:18	<maruchan>	i did this on synamptic i uninstalled xorg, then it when broke
07:18	<troy_s>	!root
07:18	<Hentai_Jeff>	it's how he's gonna learn to read sort of
07:18	<ubotu>	Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
07:18	<maruchan>	i reboted and got this error
07:18	<rendo>	She's one of those "It ain't broke, don't fix it.  I know it, it works" kinda people.
07:18	<Viaken>	jayb, sorry. lol Wasn't paying attention and was cleaning my keys.
07:18	<Flannel>	rendo: install kubuntu, and install the windowsXP theme, she'll never know the difference.
07:18	<Hentai_Jeff>	lol
07:18	<axion`>	(F*ed Up Beyond Recognition)eD
07:18	<troy_s>	maruchan:  yes, then you boot to recovery and did a 'sudo apt-get install xorg' or something akin to that?
07:18	<Hentai_Jeff>	I gotta wonder if edubuntu would be right for my sons
07:18	<jayb>	HAHA ... ok.. great .:P
07:19	<rob138>	what command show's what process is using my sound?
07:19	<grv>	lol flannel
07:19	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff going to have him use Windows at all?
07:19	<Shotgun>	a program i made has a memory leak, with not dealocating a hash table, as a result a large section of my memory is taken up by it, anyway to get it back, other then a reset?
07:19	<troy_s>	rendo:  it is broke.
07:19	<Hentai_Jeff>	later on
07:19	<maruchan>	umm i havent trie dthat troy, let me give that try as well
07:19	<Soir>	I'm intentionally giving Ubuntu to a non-computer-literate so they don't learn any other way
07:19	<jayb>	so guys.. Im getting some IBM xSeries servers in the next week.. and I want to use Ubuntu on them... but im concerned that Ill have to go redhat simply for driver support
07:19	<Hentai_Jeff>	he's gotta know some about it
07:19	<intelikey>	hehhe i had this system up and running an half setup befor i added a user account....
=== bimberi_ is now known as bimberi
07:19	<troy_s>	maruchan:  it is easy enough to fix
07:19	<rendo>	troy_s: She's a woman, what else do you expect? :P
07:19	<jayb>	has anyone used ubuntu on this ahrdware ?
07:19	<LeoStewart>	isn't Dapper Drake going to be released in a few hours?
07:19	<troy_s>	maruchan:  which is why learning your way around a cli is important.
07:19	<JoseStefan>	install IE7 that should break things
07:19	<Soir>	if they want to learn windows after they know ubuntu, they're welcome to think about it
07:19	<grv>	nah your kid will become a windows fanboy, GAMES
07:19	<axion`>	Soir - he will be The One
=== Tomek- is now known as Tomek
07:19	<troy_s>	rendo:  just explain what using ms and apple does to the future for your kids.
07:20	<axion`>	yeah rendo, give them the M$ propaganda speech
07:20	<maruchan>	lol i learned more fixing x, these past day, then using ubuntu this past year
07:20	<rendo>	Haha.
07:20	<Hentai_Jeff>	call it an experement to see if someone who started with linux going over to windows has the same hurdles
07:20	<ubuntubes>	hi
07:20	<grv>	im running on m$ right now:O
07:20	<LeoStewart>	does anyone know when Dapper Drake will be released?
07:20	<rendo>	"They'll take our first born and turn him into a slave and harvest his organs for their programmers who REALLY need it"
07:20	<OmniD>	Well if I have the hardware support this version that I didn't before I'll be supporting Ubuntu a lot more than Apple.
07:20	<troy_s>	leo:  give it a day or so.
07:20	<sime>	LeoStewart: In 24hrs my guess
07:20	<nbx909>	LeoStewart, it is out unoffically
07:20	<JoseStefan>	LeoStewart: less than 17h
07:20	<OmniD>	I mean OSX
07:20	<LeoStewart>	troy_s alright, thanks.
07:20	<spartas>	grv, that's nothing, i'm running on os x now
07:20	<Soir>	axion`: I have had concern that she's spontaneously going to develop Lain-like tendencies and I'll come back after university one year to a house filled with cabling and pieces of hardware, yes. I'll watch for it. :)
07:21	<Hentai_Jeff>	same here while my ubuntu machine is down
07:21	<mikedep333>	#nvidia

07:21	<Saj>	ive tried linux many times, i keep switching for games:D (also cuz i doent know jack all abt linux, not even how file system wrks...untill recently lol)
07:21	<Saj>	other things are macromedia suite

07:21	<ubuntubes>	is ubuntu 5.10 support hp proliant ML350 G2 ?
07:21	<La_PaRCa>	Wow. That was weird. Apparently my /home partition just went to read-only for no apparent reason. Anyone?
07:21	<ray__>	troy_s, are you still around?
07:21	<jsestri2>	Saj: fight the power, use linux as much as possible
07:21	<troy_s>	ubuntubes:  check the wiki...
07:21	<troy_s>	ray: go
07:21	<Hentai_Jeff>	ubuntubes:just give it a try
07:22	<Hentai_Jeff>	no harm in using a live CD

07:22	<ray__>	i apologize, i hit a wrong key combination and i don't know what happened. i had to restart

07:22	<troy_s>	ray:  its ok.
07:22	<Hentai_Jeff>	seperate machines for me
07:22	<rob138>	what command show's what process is using my sound?
07:22	<ray__>	what does ctrl+alt+f1 do?
07:22	<jsestri2>	troy_s: at least apple is bsd based :-D
07:22	<Saj>	nomin: yeh me, tried CS already with some problem on wine...wanna get falcon 4:AF and LOMAC on here though...and working with me joystick:D
07:22	<rendo>	I tried linux like 5 times before I stuck with it.
07:22	<GianLuigiBuffon>	because is now doing several stuff on the konsole
07:22	<La_PaRCa>	Can anyone check launchpad for this bug? I cannot open firefox and I dont want to reboot so I can diagnose it.
07:22	<Hentai_Jeff>	though I'm on the ubuntu most of the time
07:22	<troy_s>	ray:  shifts to a virtual terminal
07:22	<Viaken>	I can't access www.ubuntu.com/download Has it gone live?
07:22	<JoseStefan>	ray__: switches to tty 1 (first console)
07:22	<grv>	nope
07:22	<ray__>	how do i escape from that in the future
07:22	<grv>	i can access it
07:22	<ubuntubes>	Hentai_Jeff I'm afraid it spoil my school server because that server have RAID
07:22	<jayb>	nope
07:22	<axion`>	Dapper should be a very easy version to "stick to" imo
07:22	<grv>	still says 5.10
07:22	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: That would be installing the files it just downloaded. Good luck, and enjoy the new shinies.
07:22	<nomin>	Saj, have you ever used qjoypad?
07:22	<troy_s>	ray:  to get back to graphics, flip to f7
07:23	<phiqtion>	how do i install a source program?
07:23	<Viaken>	Nevermind. False alarm. :P
07:23	<phiqtion>	from a .tar.gz file
07:23	<Saj>	rendo: thnx, tried that before...windows kept recking linux... lol
07:23	<Viaken>	Just my crappy connection I guess. lol
07:23	<ubuntubes>	troy_s : how to check wiki?
07:23	<ray__>	ctrl+alt+f7?
07:23	<bimberi>	La_PaRCa: that's a sign that it got errors - probably mounted with the errors=remount-ro option - backed up?
07:23	<Saj>	rendo: now i got 2hdds:D he he he
07:23	<troy_s>	ray:  you can flip from consoles to gui (on f7)
07:23	<Hentai_Jeff>	wait a bit and try the live CD thing ubuntubes
07:23	<troy_s>	!wiki
07:23	<JoseStefan>	ray__: you have cnsoles on F1 thru F6, and X on F7,    ctrl+alt+f7
07:23	<jet87>	i installed a few different distros, but ubuntu was the first one i was able to stick with for a while.  i don't remember why i had to go back to windows though
07:23	<rendo>	Saj: Install Windows first, then Linux.  I'm sure there's a way to edit the boot tables but I don't know that fancy crap.
07:23	<troy_s>	http:wiki.ubuntu.com
07:23	<intelikey>	ray__ yeah tty7 is the default location for X
07:23	<Saj>	nomin: whats that ?
07:23	<bimberi>	ubotu tell phiqtion about compiling
07:23	<La_PaRCa>	bimberi, um, the thing is, it mounted correctly. It was working until a minute ago.
07:23	<ray__>	ah, now i know
07:23	<GianLuigiBuffon>	viaken... yeah, after running your command, the updates appeared...and appeared a error wich told me to click "all upgrades" on synaptics... and thats what I done.
07:23	<Hentai_Jeff>	personaly I can't wait for Cedega to get better
07:24	<rendo>	Me too.
07:24	<ray__>	back to twinview problem
07:24	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I guess that after all i'll reboot and I'll have dapper
07:24	<Saj>	rendo: hmmm, yeh but you forget you have to keep installing windows every week or so lol
07:24	<bimberi>	La_PaRCa: as i said ...
07:24	<ubuntubes>	Hentai_Jeff : is live cd dont do damage on the systems?
07:24	<troy_s>	wiki [string]  says ubotu
07:24	<rendo>	Soon as I get my new PC, I'm getting cedega.
07:24	<rob138>	anybody, what command show's what process is using my sound?
07:24	<grv>	i dont think cedega will ever become as good as native dx though:/
07:24	<La_PaRCa>	bimberi, ok, how can I know what caused the errors?
07:24	<ray__>	mind if i post contents of xorg.conf to pastebin really quick?
07:24	<Hentai_Jeff>	yes ubuntubes
07:24	<nomin>	Saj, it emulates keystrokes and the mouse on linux:  http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/
07:24	<rendo>	Saj: Only if you screw it up all the time.
07:24	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: That's the idea.
07:24	<troy_s>	ray:  google virtual terminals in linux... should be good learning.
07:24	<Hentai_Jeff>	grv:that goes without saying
07:24	<nomin>	Saj, it's a great program, but it doesn't run on ubuntu yet
07:24	<bimberi>	La_PaRCa: i'm not sure - poke around dmesg and in /var/log
07:24	<troy_s>	ray: are you having issues with x?
07:24	<JoseStefan>	80% Complete :P
07:24	<ubuntubes>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! <-- is this true?
07:24	<Hentai_Jeff>	the developers are about to have the vista hurdle
07:24	<intelikey>	ray__ alt+left-arrow  is a surefire way to find a running X from the console.... it switches one tty left each press.
07:24	<troy_s>	ray:  the kind of 'golden rule' is to set your driver to vesa
07:24	<Flannel>	ubuntubes: yes.
07:24	<GianLuigiBuffon>	thks a lot viaken. I hope to leave the noob stat and could help new users :)
07:24	<Viaken>	Virtual terminals are WONDERFUL.
07:25	<grv>	it will be a LONG time before there are some hardcore games on linux
07:25	<troy_s>	ray:  and start from there
07:25	<Saj>	rendo: i got it sorted now:D 2 hdds is theway. to boot linux or windows i simply switch the hdd for it to look in first...and keep it single boot:) woks like a charm;)
07:25	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: Just be willing to give it a go and you'll get there.
07:25	<JoseStefan>	ubuntubes: less than 17h now
07:25	<ray__>	i cannot get TV to display
07:25	<Viaken>	grv: You mean like Enemy Territory? UT2k4?
07:25	<troy_s>	ray:  oh yes... the twinview...
07:25	<rendo>	Saj: That's so complicated and un-lazy, what's wrong with you!
07:25	<troy_s>	wiki twinview
07:25	<Viaken>	NWN?
07:25	<paradon>	grv: Quake 3?
07:25	<ray__>	i've got the monitor working obviously
07:25	<ubuntubes>	YAHHHHOOooooooo....
07:25	<troy_s>	did you check the wiki?
07:25	<Merturk_NB|hw>	i'm having a problem getting a barcode scanner to work properly
07:25	<La_PaRCa>	bimberi, care to help me figure it out? I got the error on dmesg but I have no idea what it means.
07:25	<grv>	those are a FEW titles
07:25	<Viaken>	Doom 3?
07:25	<ray__>	troy_s, yes
07:25	<GianLuigiBuffon>	yeah, after i'll go nback to updates and install all that the system request me
07:25	<Viaken>	Quake 4, too, I think.
07:25	<JoseStefan>	grv, id Software's entire product line is available for linux
07:25	<ubuntubes>	I'm going to wait for this....
07:26	<nomin>	Saj, do you think you would ever use qjoypad if you could?
07:26	<Saj>	rendo: doent know:D i got the linux virus:D no more lazy:D:D:D
07:26	<ray__>	i've read plenty of howtos, tutorials, you name it
07:26	<grv>	ok, thats only several games:/
07:26	<paradizelos1>	so will there be an automatic upgrade from breezy?
07:26	<grv>	you know what im talking about
07:26	<lwarimav>	I have a problem with firefox. After installing some extensions, I couldn't restart firefox. What should I do?????
07:26	<troy_s>	ray:  hrm... iirc isn't twinview in juxtaposition to dual headed mode?  its an nvidia thing no?
07:26	<Saj>	nomin: let me get more info on it...see what it allows etc.
07:26	<Unenvarjo>	 Unreal Tournament works, if I recall correctly
07:26	<troy_s>	ray:  did you check into more pure dual head modes?
07:26	<rendo>	lwarimav: run it in the terminal and see where the errors come up.
07:26	<axion`>	does CS:Source work?
07:26	<grv>	on cedega
07:26	<Viaken>	Unenvarjo: I run Unreal Tourney 2004 on mine.
07:26	<troy_s>	ray:  pastebin your conf
07:26	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, what version of firefox
07:26	<Viaken>	axion`: I don't think so, yet.
07:26	<intelikey>	lwarimav did you test if the issue is local or system wide ?
07:26	<glick>	dapper not released yet :/
07:26	<Hentai_Jeff>	America's army has a linux version
07:26	<grv>	im not sure what the frames are though
07:26	<bimberi>	La_PaRCa: put it on the pastebin, but don't just ask me.  It's not an area of expertise for me (touches wood)
07:26	<Saj>	nomin: hell yes:D
07:26	<Viaken>	Cedega/wine's working on it.
07:27	<Hentai_Jeff>	though they're canceling it
07:27	<lwarimav>	1.5.0.1
07:27	<grv>	i play cs:s competitively, so i pretty much stick with windows
07:27	<La_PaRCa>	bimberi, gonna try and remount it somehow and will come back
07:27	<Unenvarjo>	viaken, I've got 2003 on mine, the 2004 was too expensive for my student budget back then :D
07:27	<Viaken>	Hentai_Jeff: They are? I was wondering why the latest version didn't get released on Linux. :(
07:27	<Noah0504>	Is there a reason the stream I'm listening to stops after everysong?  I have to restart Rhythmbox and start it again for it to play.
07:27	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, try firefox's safe mode
=== Merturk_NB|hw is now known as Linuturk
=== prgrmr_ is now known as prgrmr
07:27	<lwarimav>	intelikey: version 1.5
07:27	<DShepherd>	its finally June 1st here
07:27	<rob138>	what command show's what process is using my sound?
07:27	<nomin>	Saj, the reasons I'm interested are:  1) I would like to see qjoypad made for ubuntu and 2) there are minor things that need to be fixed on it.  I emailed the developer and he says he has no time to develop it and needs help.
07:27	<intelikey>	lwarimav did you test if the issue is local or system wide ?
07:27	<ray__>	troy_s, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14943
07:27	<axion`>	i think it's funny the servers run linux but they wont make the game to support it...
07:27	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, Firefox's safe mode is a good way to find out if an extension/theme or user set preferences are causing your problem. See http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_mode
07:27	<ubuntubes>	if ubuntu 6.06 out.. then server will going slow.. alot of people will download this latest ubuntu.. haha
07:27	<Hentai_Jeff>	yep Viaken but start sending in protests
07:27	<troy_s>	noah: that shouldn't happen.  have you tried it with other streams?
07:27	<Hentai_Jeff>	they'll probubaly listen
07:27	<intelikey>	lwarimav i'm the one that sujested you add a user "something"
07:27	<sklav>	hi guys im having an issue
07:28	<axion`>	im hopping on the torrent when it goes live =)
07:28	<Hentai_Jeff>	the main guy wanted to keep it going
07:28	<sklav>	my networking is all screwed up after a dist-upgrade
07:28	<troy_s>	ray:  are you getting any errors in your xlog or ???
07:28	<sklav>	eth0 and eth1 have been replaced by eth2 and eth3
07:28	<Noah0504>	troy_s: Yes.
07:28	<Linuturk>	got a link to the offical torrent?
07:28	<JoseStefan>	does anyone like the ed2k network?
07:28	<rob138>	whats the diff between the release canidate and what's coming out in hours?
07:28	<Xaero_Vincent>	yep 3 million people use Ubuntu... the servers will be packed
07:28	<nomin>	Saj, I can use it on mandriva2005 and it works great except for a few small things.  I also use it to control multimedia that I watch on my tv.  I have an usb extension for my controller so I can control the mouse and browser.
07:28	<Saj>	nomin: does it work with home made bottuns and switches which would be plugged into game port?
07:28	<lwarimav>	intelikey : my firefox is in Ubuntu
07:28	<myleftfoot>	if everyone jumps on the torrent when it goes live it should make for sweet download speeds
07:28	<sklav>	and for the life of me i cannot find where ubuntu is getting this info
07:28	<rendo>	Only 3 million?
07:28	<rendo>	Or is that a lot?
07:28	<ray__>	troy_s, xlog?
07:28	<JoseStefan>	rob138: Release Candidate is 1 week old :o
07:28	<troy_s>	noah:  strange weird.  can't say that it would be rhythm's fault because i am pretty sure there are a 1000 folks running it fine.
07:28	<Hentai_Jeff>	rendo:for a linux distro it's alot
07:28	<ray__>	i'm obviously new to this
07:29	<grv>	lol
07:29	<troy_s>	ray:  in your var/log, look to your x*.log files.
07:29	<Hentai_Jeff>	compaired to windows it's chicken feed
07:29	<rob138>	JoseStefan, not a terrible difference then
07:29	<rob138>	what command show's what process is using my sound?
07:29	<intelikey>	lwarimav are you not in ubuntu ?
07:29	<nomin>	Saj, it works as long as linux recongnizes it.
07:29	<ubuntubes>	does anybody know how to set the initial bootup into shell prompt?
07:29	<sklav>	how dow one call a module with an alias
07:29	<Noah0504>	troy_s: Hmm, I'll keep messing with it.
07:29	<lwarimav>	intelikey: yes I am
07:29	<K|NgGh0sT>	what is the best .rar handler?
07:29	<troy_s>	ray:  that's totally fine.  learning is the key to helping out others.
07:29	<Saj>	rendo: i got it.:D he he he. ill figure out how to get a external switch to change settings in the bios. ie hae a 2 way switch (button) which chooses the drive order..:D:D:D what you think?
07:29	<sklav>	eth0 is not found but its found under the name eth3
07:29	<nomin>	Saj, I don't know too many of the technical aspects of it, but it says on the website that it is based on linux's ability to recognize a joystick.
07:29	<rendo>	I'll do my part in the next few years, I plan to startup a computer shop in my area and I plan to expand to the entire northern region of the province, will offer PC's either barebone or with Ubuntu. ;)  No windows. :b
07:30	<JoseStefan>	ubuntube: you might need to mess with your init scripts, the wiki may have something on that
07:30	<Viaken>	axion`: Meanwhile your other hand is rewriting the kernel and writing shell scripts that feed your cat?
07:30	<rendo>	Saj: Master and Slave. :b
07:30	<troy_s>	kingghost:  if you add the rar support, the default archiver should handle rar.
07:30	<rpaul>	sklav: have you rebooted since the dist upgrade?
07:30	<axion`>	pfft hell no
07:30	<sklav>	yes rpaul
07:30	<sklav>	many times
07:30	<intelikey>	lwarimav i'm sorry. i fail to see the relevance of "<lwarimav>	intelikey : my firefox is in Ubuntu"  <--- i don't do windows....
07:30	<axion`>	hehe
07:30	<sklav>	no change
07:30	<ray__>	what should i be looking for in the Xorg.0.log?
07:30	<K|NgGh0sT>	troy_s: apt-get install rar?
07:30	<grv>	jack up ur prices a few bucks and tell them they get a discount for coming preinstalled with ubuntu:P
07:30	<troy_s>	sklav:  are 0 and 1 still there?
07:30	<Hentai_Jeff>	rendo good luck actully running that store
=== root_ is now known as Shadow_mil
07:30	<troy_s>	king:  apt-cache search rar
07:30	<nomin>	Saj, I would like to get more people interested in it so that it's made for more distros and so that the minor things can be fixed.  I think it's the only program necessary for using the joystick or gamepad on linux.
07:30	<sklav>	troy_s, no they are not
07:30	<lwarimav>	intelikey: I use Ubuntu
07:30	<ubuntubes>	JoseStefan : ok than i'm going to do something on it
07:30	<Saj>	rendo: already that order....:D windows is the slave ofcourse he eh eh
07:31	<rendo>	Saj: :P
07:31	<JoseStefan>	ray__: there is a way to "reset" your xorg config, if it makes you feel better
07:31	<sklav>	they are now seen as eth2 and eth3
07:31	<bkh>	Clint Eastwood pilots my Firefox.
07:31	<Hentai_Jeff>	though I'd get a laptop from you :D
07:31	<intelikey>	lwarimav yes.   and did you add a user and try to start ff as that user ?
07:31	<Saj>	nomin: i would help if i could but im a total noob my self:D atleast on linux lol
07:31	<nbx909>	Bob Dole powers mine
07:31	<nbx909>	lol
07:31	<troy_s>	sklav:  erm... and this was dist-upgrade?
07:31	<ray__>	josestefan, how's that? and what will that accomplish?
07:31	<sklav>	yes troy_s
07:31	<bkh>	http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083943/
07:31	<sklav>	dist-upgrade
07:31	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff: Thanks, I really have a huge dislike for Windows and there's no need paying $100 to make a machine for people.
07:31	<rpaul>	Is there anywork being done to make the upgrade done through ubuntu torrent based.  That would surely reduce the server load for those dist-upgrading
07:31	<troy_s>	sklav:  well i will say that it is fixable for certain.  sounds like a skript borked you a bit.
07:31	<JoseStefan>	ray__: in case "something" messed it up, it should be good as new again
07:32	<grv>	wow
07:32	<sklav>	any idea which 1?
07:32	<grv>	clint eastwood._____.
07:32	<lwarimav>	intelikey: I am connected to a server. And My profile is registered in the server...
07:32	<axion`>	rpaul, thats an awesome idea. to expand upon that... why doesn't Steam do that as well?
07:32	<Hentai_Jeff>	something I've been thinking about doing it making a net and local based uber PC shop
07:32	<grv>	5.5/10, poor firefox
07:32	<ray__>	troy_s, what should i be looking for in the Xorg.0.log?
07:32	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, before going through the add a user step there are a number of firefox trouble shooting steps, the first being to start firefox's safe mode
07:32	<troy_s>	sklav:  are they active etc?
07:32	<ray__>	josestefan, how do you reset it?
07:32	<sklav>	something todo with how the kernel loaded the module and associated alias
07:32	<maruchan>	thank you troy
07:32	<rpaul>	axion`: yeah, blizzard does it with there updated for WoW
07:32	<maruchan>	 i have it running again
07:32	<sklav>	yes im on the system now
07:32	<troy_s>	ray:  look for errors related to the nvidia end of things
07:32	<ray__>	i know about creating backups and such
07:32	<nomin>	Saj, well if you see more people that want to play games or have mouse and keyboard emulation with the joystick, just tell them about qjoypad.  Do you agree that it's a very useful program?
07:32	<DarkTower>	Hentai_Jeff: with ubuntu preinstalled :)
07:32	<troy_s>	maruchan:  yay
07:33	<intelikey>	lwarimav remote desktop ?
07:33	<axion`>	that's because blizzard is king of flawless execution
07:33	<Hentai_Jeff>	so ppl that want that kick ass looking and running PC but haven't the time to do it can still get it
07:33	<sklav>	what is the equivalent of modprobe.conf on ubuntu?
07:33	<Viaken>	You know...I was thinking. Couldn't someone make a package manager that used torrents instead of fetching the files normally? Or, at least, the larger files?
07:33	<troy_s>	maruchan:  now spread the ubuntu.
07:33	<Hentai_Jeff>	and ubuntu would be an option yes
07:33	<JoseStefan>	ray__: remember, to make a copy first. let me look for it
07:33	<SurfnKid>	has anyone installed the lm_sensors yet?
07:33	<lwarimav>	intelikey: I do not see any safe mode*
07:33	<Joetheodd>	How do I create a shared folder on my Linux box that I can put files in from another Linux box (Warty live CD)?
07:33	<ubuntubes>	is apt-get update process will changing my edited script?
07:33	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff: Mine will start out most likely as a hardware/repair place and once I get the business, start making preset machines while still offering custom built and basic hardware options.
07:33	<majd>	can you create restore points in ubuntu?
07:33	<troy_s>	joetheodd:  use ssh
07:33	<SurfnKid>	I downloaded the i2c and lm_sensors from the site but when i unzip them, whats next?
07:33	<intelikey>	lwarimav i didn't say safe mode
07:33	<RopeHead>	rob138, fuser -v /dev/dsp
07:33	<JoseStefan>	ray__: try this -->	sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
07:33	<rpaul>	Viaken: it just makes sense aye.  doesn't seem to be done any any distros i can think of
07:33	<intelikey>	lwarimav that was someone else
07:33	<troy_s>	joetheodd:  everything else is ugly insecure.
07:33	<axion`>	yeah it's about time the torrent technology get's widely adopted
07:34	<troy_s>	!ssh
07:34	<DarkTower>	Hentai_Jeff: its a good idea
07:34	<Hentai_Jeff>	I'd give it 2 years of me being an actual success before Dell buys me
07:34	<ubotu>	[ssh]  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SSHHowto or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AdvancedOpenSSH
07:34	<nbx909>	Joetheodd, http://krazypenguin.net/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_6.06_Guide#How_to_share_folders_the_easy_way
07:34	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_mode
07:34	<rob138>	ropehead, thanks ill try that

07:34	<Hentai_Jeff>	or tries
07:34	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff: Don't succumb. :P
07:34	<[1] Troy>	At my request, would all you guys mind NOT downloading DAPPER right away?  I dont want to wait for slow download... kk thx.
07:34	<ampersand>	why is Dapper not being released at 0:00 I have been waiting two days for this
07:34	<axion`>	torrent it, troy =)
07:34	<bkh>	ampersand: Just to mess with you
07:34	<thug>	hi all
07:34	<[1] Troy>	axion - from where???
07:34	<Saj>	nomin: are there any more like qpad?
07:34	<Hentai_Jeff>	hey I could make it where they can but only if they start offering ubuntu on their PCs
07:34	<grv>	they are waiting for 0:00 gmt -12
07:34	<thug>	its dapper available yet ?
07:34	<ubuntubes>	does anybody know that is apt-get update process will changing my edited script?
07:35	<jtd>	majd just asked a good question: can you create restore points in Ubuntu?  Or something like them?
07:35	<nbx909>	thug, not offically but we believe we've found it
07:35	<Joetheodd>	troy_s: It's all behind a hardware firewall - I'm just transfering over my LAN.
07:35	<ray__>	troy_s, please look at this

07:35	<DarkTower>	Hentai_Jeff: They almost did have it preinstalled on a laptop instead of XP
07:35	<Noah0504>	troy_s: I lied.  I just found a stream that doesn't do that.  But I still wonder why some of the others are.
07:35	<troy_s>	joe:  that's fine.  just make sure 22 is open.
07:35	<[1] Troy>	lol viaken
07:35	<DarkTower>	Hentai_Jeff: OOps that was HP
07:35	<nomin>	Saj, not that I know of.  I've looked and found nothing like it.  I think something like this should be a standard program that comes with every distro.
07:35	<Hentai_Jeff>	Dell thought about it
07:35	<Viaken>	jtd: You could probably just backup /etc/, or everything except /home/ and use that as a restore point.
07:35	<thug>	nbx909 what do you mean you belive you`ll find it ?
07:35	<JoseStefan>	in true fairness, they are waiting for all countries to pass to 1st of June (just a guess)
07:35	<troy_s>	laf...
07:35	<rendo>	DarkTower: I can't see them doing it though, they can't bloat Ubuntu as easily as they can XP with crap. :)
07:35	<Hentai_Jeff>	their servers use fedora core too

07:37	<ray__>	geez... what's gl?
07:37	<Hentai_Jeff>	BTW is there anything different offered on the ubuntu server version then the text only install?
07:37	<ubuntubes>	does anybody know where to put the web folder ? i have installed apache
07:37	<sklav>	anybody?
07:37	<axion`>	Hentai_Jeff... u mean "other" than?
07:37	<DarkTower>	rendo: how amazing would it be for a major vendor like that to be preinstalling ubuntu
07:37	<lwarimav>	intelikey: my computer is connected to a network centralised to a server that registered all profile usine this computer... So my firefox doen't work.... Now my question is should i solve it localy on the PC, or I have to edit my profile on the server?????
07:37	<sklav>	where can i add alias 8139too eth0
07:38	<rendo>	DarkTower: It would be a dream come true to the community.
07:38	<axion`>	yes, the link i posted is the daily build liveCD

07:38	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, after installing apache you should create public_html/ in your home directory for a web folder
07:38	<blurtblurt>	wow. Dapper still doesn't autoload kernel drivers for PCMCIA cards
07:38	<thug>	nbx909 thanks you ... its that the official release ?
07:38	<CHodapp>	Why does Ubuntu seem to be a massive target for hatred?
07:38	<Hentai_Jeff>	hmm I just remembered a cosplay skit from a few years back
07:38	<ray__>	yes, josestefan. i've run that earlier today actually when i installed this nvidia card
07:38	<Hentai_Jeff>	has anyone seen chobits?
07:38	<Saj>	dapper out yet?
07:39	<ampersand>	i am working on clearing out my computer to do a fresh install right now
07:39	<spikeb>	read the topic
07:39	<Viaken>	Not yet, Saj.
07:39	<ray__>	troy_s, what is gl?
07:39	<axion`>	CHodapp, because of its potential for greatness, and the normal troll hatred of things that are popular
07:39	<Saj>	viaken: :(

07:39	<guest_>	69_@ yahoo.com

07:39	<Zambini>	Hey, someone wanna help me with vnc and an ubuntu>XP connection? pm me
07:39	<eigenlambda>	CHodapp: because it's more successful than others
07:39	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : is that all so anybody can access to my web?
07:39	<thug>	nbx909 hope you didnt give me the beta release ;)
=== freebsd_fan is now known as [a] freebsd_fan
07:39	<JoseStefan>	ray__: alternativly, you could do it without the -phigh paramter, and it will ask you a lot of questions, i suggest using the "nv" driver instead of "nvidia" for the time being
07:39	<ray__>	troy_s, yes i did until i turned it off
07:39	<CHodapp>	It's certainly been getting a lot of publicity for being apparently a lot more easier than Windows to install and set up
07:39	<eigenlambda>	trolls like to go wherever the people are
07:39	<Viaken>	CHodapp: No matter what it is, you'll always find someone who hates it.
07:39	<fiendskull9>	doesnt dapper come out today? (tommorow, whatever you wanna say)
07:39	<eigenlambda>	of course
07:40	<Hentai_Jeff>	Chodapp:it has?
07:40	<grv>	!dapper
07:40	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
07:40	<eigenlambda>	to remind them that cthulhu is coming
07:40	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, yes. It shows as http://yourhost.yourdomain/~youraccount/ when using a browser
07:40	<jtd>	fiendskull9: should do, yes.
07:40	<paradon>	thug: nbx909 gave you the latest daily build, which some people here think will be identical to the same release.
07:40	<fiendskull9>	yayaya
07:40	<fiendskull9>	i cant wait
07:40	<troy_s>	ray:  ok well then you are def on the driver...
07:40	<Hentai_Jeff>	most ppl don't even see windows geting installed
07:40	<CHodapp>	Hentai_Jeff, relative to other distros, at least.
07:40	<mikedep333>	can anyone tell me how to check what runs on what runlevels in dapper?
07:40	<majd>	i've seen that message 15 times in the last 2 minutes lol
07:40	<ray__>	josestefan, i'm currently having no problems on my desktop, i just can't get svideo out to work on TV
07:40	<CHodapp>	Hentai_Jeff, nope, they don't.
07:40	<jtd>	I should have had a Dapper release party :)
07:40	<troy_s>	ray:  do a little hunting under dual head mode.  twinview is some driver mod by nvidia.
07:40	<Hentai_Jeff>	so they don't really know
07:40	<fiendskull9>	probably around 8-9 am CST?
07:40	<lwarimav>	kbrosnan:my computer is connected to a network centralised to a server that registered all profile usine this computer... So my firefox doen't work.... Now my question is should i solve it localy on the PC, or I have to edit my profile on the server?????
07:40	<troy_s>	ray:  dual head mode is the more x-windows pure way of doing that sort of thing.
07:40	<rendo>	I wonder how pissed my wife would be if she woke up to Ubuntu as her OS.....
07:40	<DarkTower>	will the official ubuntu book be coming out in print??
07:40	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : no I dont want ~ , I just want it to be on root
07:40	<spikeb>	heh
07:40	<JoseStefan>	ray__: oh, i thought you had X starting problems :S
07:41	<grv>	rendo, how good is she with comps?
07:41	<Zambini>	Hey, someone wanna help me with vnc and an ubuntu>XP connection? pm me
07:41	<jtd>	rendo: back it up first, then upgrade her to Ubuntu :)
07:41	<spikeb>	my wife thought it was cool when she'd wake up without windows on her pc
07:41	<spikeb>	long as it booted
07:41	<ray__>	sorry, josestefan. i should have specified
07:41	<grv>	is there anything she does that she cant possibly do on nix
07:41	<rendo>	grv: She's an idiot. :P
07:41	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubese, oh. The root apache directory is /var/www something
07:41	<fiendskull9>	rendo, ive considered installing slackware 2.3 without a gui on one of my enemys computers
07:41	<grv>	exactly
07:41	<Saj>	rendo: lol hahaha, what she using atm?
07:41	<nomin>	Saj: have you tried cedega yet?
07:41	<rendo>	saj: XP. :/
07:41	<JoseStefan>	ray__: maybe i missed something, it is pretty cluttered in here :o
07:41	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, is this person a PC lover?
07:41	<DarkTower>	rendo: my gf loves it. hates windows now. AFter she saw how much more quickly devices like camera and ipod worked, out with windows
07:41	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, no, one of those, IE and AIM on the desktop type of people
07:41	<jtd>	fiendskull9: doesn't Slack have a reasonably easy to use package manager that would let them install a gui pretty fast?
07:41	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : oo so meaning that I have to paste it into www right?
07:41	<ray__>	troy_s, so do you know much about dual head mode?
07:41	<rendo>	DarkTower: Well she bugs me all the time about the stupidest things.
07:42	<VR_>	i wish wireless would work better.
07:42	<intelikey>	lwarimav looks like you are going to need some advanced help there.  myself being network illiterate, i'm not sure if you are talking about a remote desktop from a terminal server or just a lan config.  so i will have to defer you to more qualified help.    crimson maybe ?
07:42	<fiendskull9>	jtd, we are talking 2.3, like 1996 here :P
07:42	<Saj>	nomin: no, just been on wine for the last few days...is cedega easier to operate then wine, i mean is it reali as simple as rag and drop?
07:42	<zcat[1] >	http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso  -- is this it? :-)
07:42	<jtd>	fiendskull9: hahahahaha :D
07:42	<ray__>	josestefan, it's very cluttered in here!
07:42	<DarkTower>	rendo: lol shes your wife, thats her job
07:42	<troy_s>	ray:  done a couple times.  it should seem easy compared to twinview :)
07:42	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes: umm, no. The /var/www/ is visible by default. Just put content in there :)
07:42	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, I have a floppy disk that makes a ramdisk and runs MacOS 6 or something on it in 512x384... all monochrome
07:42	<rendo>	DarkTower: Like "I downloaded this torrent for <TYCOON GAME HERE>	and it's a .dmg file, how do I make it so it works on windows"
07:42	<fiendskull9>	jtd, but i beleive they even used slapt back then, but the repositories would be weird
07:42	<Unenvarjo>	it shows as http://yourhost.yourdomain/
07:42	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, none of that should matter just "firefox -safe-mode" in a console window
07:42	<Saj>	rendo: install a theme that looks like xp lol hahaha confuse her;)
07:42	<rendo>	So I come here, and ask since I'm tired as shit and I don't know macs at all.
07:42	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, lmao
07:42	<DarkTower>	rendo: heheh
07:42	<jtd>	fiendskull9: and by "weird" we mean "not there" :)
07:42	<fiendskull9>	Saj, they have those, they are pretty nice
07:42	<rendo>	Learn it's for macs and won't work on windows. :P
07:42	<eigenlambda>	you mean system 6
07:42	<fiendskull9>	jtd, lol
07:42	<PPower>	_nano_: Hello again! I have finally fixed it!!!
07:42	<ray__>	troy_s, any good places to learn how to accomplish dual head?
07:42	<Viaken>	I'd love to get my g/f running Linux of any type, but she's so attached to MSN's piddly lil features that the open source IM clients haven't caught up with (or avoid for good reason)...
07:42	<rendo>	So I beat her.
07:42	<threat>	is it released yet?
07:42	<CHodapp>	eigenlambda, yes, I probably do.
07:42	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, and any directory under /var/www/ shows as http://yourhost.blahblah/mydir/
07:42	<eigenlambda>	it wasn't called "mac os" until 7.6
07:43	<eigenlambda>	hehe
07:43	<JoseStefan>	rendo: try daemon tools for windows
07:43	<eigenlambda>	jinxt
07:43	<troy_s>	ray:  start with the wiki, then the forums.  i am pretty sure you will hit success shortly.
07:43	<jtd>	yeah
07:43	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : oo i got it... thanks
07:43	<jtd>	it was "System 7.5"
07:43	<CHodapp>	eigenlambda, uses VMac... pretty handy because it's light.
07:43	<Unenvarjo>	np
07:43	<fiendskull9>	Viaken, kopete has some nice little piddley features
07:43	<rendo>	JoseStefan: Doesn't work with .dmg files, unless there's a newer version that supports it.
07:43	<lwarimav>	intelikey: Its a lan config
07:43	<_nano_>	PPower: congrats! \o./
07:43	<Hentai_Jeff>	rendo:your wife prefers macs?
07:43	<axion`>	maybe PowerISO?
07:43	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, check if I'm right though, I have a terrible memory and I almost never use the apache root directory
07:43	<troy_s>	ray:  off to beddy.  good luck.  and if you don't hit it, just come back.  this place has plenty of knowledgable folks
07:43	<Viaken>	fiendskull9: I'll look into it. :P
07:43	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff: No, she downloaded a .dmg file and tried to get it to work on a PC machine.
07:43	<jtd>	especially 10.4
07:43	<fiendskull9>	My schools computers run OSX tiger, and i primarily use the terminal for everything
07:44	<ray__>	thanks for the help, troy_s
07:44	<Hentai_Jeff>	hmm
07:44	<fiendskull9>	dont need no fancy aqua gui :P
07:44	<rendo>	PowerISO converted it, but wouldn't emulate it.
07:44	<CHodapp>	My school computers are mostly Windows
07:44	<_nano_>	PPower: so how did you solve it? i'm really curious :D
07:44	<nomin>	Saj:  wine is a pain in the ass.  Cedega is much easier than wine.  Cedega is built on wine.  I tried the cedega demo and it works beautifully.  It even installs the updates.  It's awesome.  Only problem I found is that you can't play on punkbuster enabled servers because it doesn't like non-windows computers.
07:44	<PPower>	_nano_: There is still one issue to iron out though. Every time I reboot I have to run iwconfig eth1 ap any and then disable and then reenable the adapter to get any signal
07:44	<jtd>	Aqua *is* pretty, though
07:44	<intelikey>	lwarimav then ignore all other computers and work on the one firefox is on.    all my questions will be addressing that particular box.
07:44	<Hentai_Jeff>	the logic of that escapes me
07:44	<PPower>	_nano_: Wired it up and installed the fwcutter package, then run the ubuntu script
07:44	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : hehe...
07:44	<CHodapp>	nomin, that's weird, Enemy Territory uses punkbuster and I'm on Linux
07:44	<fiendskull9>	jtd, yes very, the apple GD's hit a big note when osx came out. a BIG note
07:44	<nomin>	cedega is very easy to use
07:44	<_nano_>	PPower: aah nice..so now you are using the bcm43xx driver then
07:44	<Hentai_Jeff>	it's like that damn boot camp
07:44	<intelikey>	lwarimav do you have more than one user account on that box ?
07:44	<CHodapp>	The interface on OS X is nice but it's not anything particularly special to me
07:44	<RancidLM>	any rumors on what time 6.06 is being released?
07:44	<grv>	does cedega really not work on pb:(?
07:44	<PPower>	_nano_: yes, did you get that thing about the reboot though?
07:45	<grv>	!dapper
07:45	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
07:45	<_nano_>	PPower: pm?
07:45	<lwarimav>	intelikey: yes
07:45	<fiendskull9>	jtd, it would be a godsend if they released all the gui source, and graphics for it. it would be very portable
07:45	<ubuntubes>	Does anybody know how to limit the bandwidth for individual workstation??
07:45	<Saj>	nomin: yeh it was called wine x before....how do you get the demo mate?
07:45	<PPower>	_nano_: ??? i dont get you
07:45	<gambit>	in dpkg-reconfigure locales how do i select en_us, it wont check the box
07:45	<lwarimav>	intelikey: I have more than 100 users
07:45	<intelikey>	lwarimav does firefox work for other users ?
07:45	<nomin>	Chodapp, maybe punkbuster allows linux now.  I tried it a few months ago, guess I'll have to try it again.  it was an issue in the cedega forums, cedega said they were'nt able to play on punkbuster at that time.
07:45	<Hentai_Jeff>	what is the point of booting winblows on a mac?
07:45	<sklav>	how can one grep inside a bunch of files for a particular word?
07:45	<rendo>	Games.
07:45	<jtd>	fiendskull9: I'm waiting for the day they reimplement Cocoa, Aqua, Carbon, and the rest of the OS on top of L4 instead of something Mach-y.  ::drool::
07:45	<sklav>	example /etc
07:45	<nomin>	Saj, it's on cedegas site.
07:45	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, well, its just like using linux (unless your a PandC type of guy)
07:45	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, a program called wondershaper can do that
07:45	<lwarimav>	intelikey: yes but exept me
07:45	<eigenlambda>	what't the point of getting a mac in thefirst place?
07:45	<CHodapp>	nomin, eh... it's been in ET for at least a year now, that's when I got it - could be longer, even
07:45	<rendo>	Haha.
07:45	<Saj>	btw guys of the community, gals of the community, dev team, eery one....ubuntu rox:D
07:46	<grv>	hentai_jeff, i know someone whos parents bought him a mac for college so he wouldnt game
07:46	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, uh.... how?
07:46	<fiendskull9>	agreed
07:46	<Saj>	thnx for ubuntu
07:46	<rendo>	grv: LOL
07:46	<sklav>	anybody?
07:46	<rendo>	grv: That's awesome. :B
07:46	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, darwin was written from unix source
07:46	<Hentai_Jeff>	ok there's the only good point I've seen for that
07:46	<grv>	but he kept his grades up and he eventually took his comp with him after the first semister
07:46	<sklav>	how can one grep inside a bunch of files for a particular word? example eth3 in /etc/*
07:46	<intelikey>	lwarimav ok then it is a local issue.  i.e. the probolem exists within your /home/<your_name>/ dir
07:46	<grv>	lol
07:46	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : ok i give a try
07:46	<eigenlambda>	What's the deal with you mac fanatics? ...I don't see why anybody would choose a Mac over other faster, cheaper, more stable systems.
07:46	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, i think 95% of OSX commands are unix commands
07:46	<Viaken>	Unenvarjo: Should I be bothered that it hasn't been updated in 4 years?
07:46	<msikma>	When will the site's /download page be updated?
07:46	<troy_s>	sklav:  man grep
07:46	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, that's great, but people usually only see the GUI.
07:46	<Saj>	nomin: thnx, ii thought its one of them tight one:D:D:D....he he he
07:46	<lwarimav>	intelikey/
07:46	<rendo>	Windows is garbage, MAC's are like pre-garbage moldy cabbage, and Ubuntu is my wife's canoloni's
07:46	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, yeah
07:46	<Viaken>	msikma: When Dapper is officially released.
07:46	<msikma>	eigenlambda: tsk. Starting zealous discussions again?
07:46	<spartas>	sklav: grep -i <search_text>	<directory>
07:47	<Saj>	nomin rox:D
07:47	<nomin>	CHodapp, maybe some games can play on PB and some can't.  I don't know.
07:47	<msikma>	This is why I hate this channel.
07:47	<jtd>	eigenlambda: are you talking about hardware?  other than the thermal paste debacle, Macs are very, very well-designed machines.
07:47	<nosklo>	i want final dapper, where is it, where is it, where is it
07:47	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, if you go to the prompt, then maybe it's like using Linux.
07:47	<sklav>	thanks spartas
07:47	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, i do enjoy chatting with _real_ mac geeks though, because they appreciate the core
07:47	<Unenvarjo>	viaken, I haven't been. That just means it sta(b)le :P
07:47	<axion`>	they should make Ubuntu commercials featuring the 'Mac Guy' and the 'PC Guy'
07:47	<Flannel>	people! .*wars are for #ubuntu-offtopic!
07:47	<Viaken>	LOL
07:47	<rendo>	Heh.
07:47	<lastnode>	+1 to that
07:47	<Hentai_Jeff>	axion:yes, god yes
07:47	<lastnode>	let's keep this open for support
07:47	<lwarimav>	intelikey: Can you specify the directory in my home that i should edit????
07:47	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : do you know how to get this wondershaper ?
07:47	<fiendskull9>	axion`, those commercials piss me off, because PCguy potrays a windows  user
07:47	<fiendskull9>	ugh
07:47	<Hentai_Jeff>	I hate those comercials though
07:47	<axion`>	yeah
07:47	<Viaken>	axion`: That would be funny... "Hi! I'm a Mac" "I'm a PC!" ..."We run Ubuntu." *hugs all around*
07:48	<rendo>	Here's how the commericial would go.
07:48	<CHodapp>	UBUNTU? WTF IS THAT?
07:48	<lastnode>	guys >>	#ubuntu-offtopic
07:48	<axion`>	the guys that plays 'PC Guy' is a hilarious anchor on the Daily Show
07:48	<jtd>	eigenlambda: why?
07:48	<eigenlambda>	lastnode: ya rly.  mac discussion >>	elsewhere
07:48	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, I recall that it was in universe, but that was somewhere in the time of warty or hoary
07:48	<nomin>	Choddapp: do you use a joystick with games on linux?
07:48	<axion`>	Ubuntu would have to be a very tall african
07:48	<grv>	i had one of the first versions of the ipod, will never buy apple crap again
07:48	<JoseStefan>	nah, they should hire the "Subway's" guy
07:48	<CHodapp>	nomin, yes, sometimes
07:48	<intelikey>	lwarimav that is good.   try this in a terminal   cd /home && sudo tar -czf backup.tgz `whoami` && cd
07:48	<axion`>	whose head is probably not even in frame
07:48	<grv>	terrible support system
07:48	<rendo>	"*cough sneeze cough* I got a virus again" "If you're a MAC you don't get viruses PC" *stealth ninja walks in and murders both* "Ubuntu knows kung-fu"
07:48	<nomin>	Chodapp, have you ever heard of qjoypad?
07:48	<CHodapp>	Nope
07:48	<CHodapp>	Why?
07:48	<intelikey>	lwarimav that will make a backup of your home
07:48	<dooglus>	what's the program called that lets me set the preferred applications in gnome?
07:49	<CHodapp>	rendo, put him in a hospital on life support with no one allowed to visit him... "I'll never get viruses again!"
07:49	<axion`>	ubuntu accuses mac guy of being in the closet and kicks dirt on PC guy
07:49	<Hentai_Jeff>	lol rendo
07:49	<nomin>	CHodapp, I think it's a very useful program that ought to be a part of every distro:  http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/
07:49	<eigenlambda>	CHodapp: alright, i dane no idea what your name is supposed to mean
07:49	<nomin>	CHodapp:  it emulates keystroks and mouse with a joystick/gamepad
07:49	<Hentai_Jeff>	it'd be like that ctrl+alt+del comic
07:49	<lastnode>	dooglus, System ->Preferences ->Preferred Applications ?
07:49	<CHodapp>	nomin, hmmm....
07:49	<rendo>	Who argues with Kung-fu?
07:49	<intelikey>	lwarimav next you can do an rm .mozilla-f* -rf      and then start firefox
07:49	<rendo>	Like come on.
07:50	<CHodapp>	eigenlambda, Chris Hodapp
07:50	<nomin>	CHodapp:  it's not packaged for ubuntu yet.  I can only use it on mandriva now.
07:50	<eigenlambda>	CHodapp: oh, ok
07:50	<dooglus>	lastnode: yes, that one.  what's the program name?  like the name of the binary?
07:50	<nomin>	CHodapp:  other than a few small things, it's an awesome program.  I use it for games and for viewing multimedia on my tv.
07:50	<CHodapp>	I've got a nice Logitech joystick that I got used for $5, but I don't know where I'd want to use it with this...
07:50	<eigenlambda>	i was trying to parse it like 'CHod.app'
07:50	<dooglus>	lastnode: I'm running XFCE, so I don't see the menu, but some apps still use the GNOME settings.

07:51	<amac>	so what are the ubuntu people doing right now?
07:51	<nomin>	CHodapp: I emailed the develper for qjoypad and he says he doesn't have time to develop it, he would like help from more people.
07:51	<CHodapp>	amac,  I dunno,  I'm a Slackware user
07:51	<lastnode>	amac, they're hanging in #ubuntu-offtopic
07:51	<amac>	developers I mean
07:51	<rendo>	Or maybe the commericial could have 3 generations of men.
07:51	<CHodapp>	though I may try Ubuntu - I've got some extra space on this box
07:51	<SurfnKid>	has anyone had big problems with the i2c and lm-sensor install?

07:53	<rendo>	You know what a nasty practical joke would be?
07:53	<cam>	dapper out soon ... damn what if I've installed 5.1 ? can I upgrade easily ?
07:53	<amac>	cool
07:53	<JoseStefan>	DShepherd, cause by then it will be the 2nd of June

07:53	<rendo>	If someone renamed an XP install iso to an ubuntu install iso and someone went to install it and installed windows :(
07:53	<stjepan>	thug, but is it true?

07:57	<intelikey>	lwarimav and you can't sudo ?    can you su -  ?
07:57	<MTecknology>	is there any program that will speak text the I type and hopefully feed it back into my computer?

08:06	<jiping>	what about xMule?
08:06	<Seveas>	Vaske_Car, the final iso is not released yet

08:07	<jiping>	do we need to change to the formal dapper, or the beta version can be updated
08:07	<intelikey>	lwarimav if you made a backup and you don't see any reason to keep it.  you can rm it now.
08:07	<DShepherd>	Seveas: what time is he getting up?
08:07	<intelikey>	lwarimav your welcome.

08:08	<dooglus>	how do I revert back to the version of a package which is in the repos, if I have since built and installed a newer version from CVS?
08:08	<JoseStefan>	"cd"
08:08	<Vaske_Car>	so for amule: sudo apt-get install amule      <<< is this right command?
08:08	<Flannel>	JoseStefan: you'll have to wait then.
08:08	<jiping>	hi fujitsu, how are u
08:08	<jiping>	yep
08:08	<JoseStefan>	i just need to verify the MD5's once the final is released officially
08:09	<JoseStefan>	and cross my fingers so i dont have to re-download :S
08:09	<Fujitsu>	Hi jiping.
08:09	<myleftfoot>	JoseStefan: yup you have to wait and torrent up like the rest of us.
08:09	<rahonavis>	Vaske i often perform multiple admin tasks under sudo so what i do is "sudo su" and the apt-get install amule you might want to enable your universe and multiverse
08:09	<intelikey>	Vaske_Car yes
08:09	<herbheart>	rahonavis you might want to try sudo -i
08:09	<z4k4ri4>	still not released, 6:09 UTC
08:09	<Saj>	is there a page with all the features of dapper drake on it ?
08:09	<rahonavis>	thank you
08:09	<Fujitsu>	rahonavis, sudo -i
08:09	<Vaske_Car>	does 6.06 uninstall all required libraries if we uninstall some software or it leave libraries?
08:09	<rahonavis>	i was looking foor the proper way to do it
08:09	<dooglus>	myleftfoot: why would you use the torrent if you already have breezy?  you can just update breezy to dapper
08:10	<rob138>	so it's released now?
08:10	<grv>	some ppl like a fresh install
08:10	<MTecknology>	lastnode, I can make festival speak text, how to I make that audio input from my microphone
08:10	<rahonavis>	person i helped, see the responses :)
08:10	<intelikey>	Vaske_Car leaves libs
08:10	<grv>	or want to burn for others
08:10	<rob138>	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
08:10	<myleftfoot>	dooglus: i have dapper. final RC. I just need the iso to burn some for my friends and family
08:10	<dooglus>	Vaske_Car: it depends how you uninstall.  apt-get will leave libraries, debfoster won't.  aptitude can delete dependencies too.
08:10	<dooglus>	myleftfoot: I see.
08:10	<intelikey>	Vaske_Car install deborphan and run that.
08:11	<JoseStefan>	Seveas: what was that? if you dont mind me asking?
08:11	<swarmz>	so it's not been released yet?
08:11	<rahonavis>	myleftfoot, are they having surgery that requires the final iso immediately ?  ;)  :)
08:11	<Seveas>	JoseStefan, an idiot
08:11	<swarmz>	how annoying!
08:11	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, always good to get rid of them.
08:11	<freakabcd>	rahonavis, hisrightfoot might know :p
08:11	<Vaske_Car>	intelikey, is there any tutorial of how to uninstall everything that we do not need for server in order to make computer a bit faster, or it is not neccesary?
08:11	<myleftfoot>	rohonavis, no but when they get them windows gets to go to heaven
08:12	<intelikey>	Vaske_Car not that i am aware of.
08:12	<Vaske_Car>	roger
08:12	<JoseStefan>	Vaske_Car: you only have to worry about active processes, and those you can check with "top"
08:12	<Tomcat_>	Vaske_Car: Install "debfoster" package and run "sudo debfoster"
08:12	<Krank>	lastnode, you still there?
08:12	<JoseStefan>	Vaske_Car: but be careful what you decide to remove
08:12	<Tomcat_>	Vaske_Car: debfoster will make sure only packages that are needed are installed, and the rest will be uninstalled.

08:12	<swarmz>	rob138: I can't respond to PMs because of "spam issues"
08:13	<Vaske_Car>	i will do it tomorrow, i must go sleep now ;(
08:13	<Tomcat_>	Vaske_Car: But as JoseStefan said... be careful what to remove.
08:13	<intelikey>	Tomcat_ yeah that's handy to trim ship with.
08:13	<rob138>	swarmz, on my side?
08:13	<swarmz>	rob138: when will apt be able to deliver the update?
08:13	<khermans>	This is a Dapper SMS notifier on release within one miinute of being out...
08:13	<rahonavis>	freakabcd, yes i understand.. and even i fall victim to this when i get excited.  but i did the right thing and tried the RC which is fine by me.  i can download the iso of proper release later.
08:13	<Vaske_Car>	thanks guys and good night all!
08:13	<Bilford>	47 minutes maybe
08:13	<Vaske_Car>	cya tomorrow

08:18	<Corey>	Awseome :)
08:18	<swarmz>	well the release date was 00:00 GMT and it's passed that, so that counts as a delay i think

08:20	<zcat[1] >	Corey: too late.
08:20	<dunnix>	i had to mess around alot to get my resolution right on my widescreen    is dapper going to mess that up?
08:20	<Fujitsu>	dunnix, possibly.
08:20	<swarmz>	oh well
08:20	<Kmirno>	Mybe we should close this channel until release ?
08:20	<nomasteryoda>	dunnix, save your xorg.conf

08:22	<Seveas>	Kmirno, cut the offtopicness
08:22	<jameswang>	zcat[1] , Maybe your ISO got something wrong?
08:22	<dunnix>	nomasteryoda: but dapper should be able to read my custom modlines fine then?
08:22	<Seveas>	Corey, #html perhaps
08:22	<nomasteryoda>	dunnix,  i had same problems with my dualscreens on suse 9.3, 10.0 ... backed up the 5th time i overwrote it
08:22	<nomasteryoda>	=D
08:22	<Healot>	Corey: you can use mozilla-chat instead

08:22	<rob138>	Fujitsu, that didn't do anything, sound is still being used up... dsp?
08:22	<Corey>	mozilla chat ?

08:22	<Kmirno>	Seveas: sorry just trying to divert from the "when dapper is released" huhu but ok I ****
08:22	<JoseStefan>	zcat[1] : you should verify your iso with the corresponding MD5SUMS file
08:22	<zcat[1] >	ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso - sounds fairly final to me.. :-)
08:22	<Fujitsu>	rob138, work out what's using it.

08:30	<khermans>	Sorry server was acting weird...updated
08:30	<khermans>	wget http://kristianhermansen.com/tmp/DapperOut && perl DapperOut
08:30	<robinl1>	Guys..
08:30	<l_r>	how much do we have to wait?
08:30	<robinl1>	Dapper is already...
08:30	<JoseStefan>	jrsims, a friend of mine has it
08:30	<Fujitsu>	!dapper
08:30	<Hodapp>	Oh calm down...
08:30	<lastnode>	l_r, read the topic!
08:30	<robinl1>	Released
08:30	<robinl1>	but not officialy
08:30	<jameswang>	How can shield the "join/quit" message?
08:30	<robinl1>	xD
08:30	<Touru>	It's possible to update via normal updater, isn't it? But, is it better to do a fresh install?
08:30	<cef>	swarmz: might end up as the final release, but there is no official word on wether it will be. till there's official word, it can't technically be the release
08:30	<l_r>	lastnode,  i read it 24.01 hours ago
08:30	<herbheart>	l_r til June 1, midday
08:30	<robinl1>	I have the  new dapper right here now.
08:30	<l_r>	it's obsolete
08:30	<jrsims>	JoseStefan: well, maybe you can answer this. I've installed xgl and compiz (and supporting packages). But how do I start it?
08:30	<lastnode>	Touru, apt-get dist-upgrade works fine
08:31	<robinl1>	it's from yesterday
08:31	<swarmz>	i wanted an excuse to not do anything at work today!
08:31	<lastnode>	l_r, well, it still stands
08:31	<swarmz>	damn it!
08:31	<Hodapp>	Seveas, sheesh, it was a joke...
08:31	<Graig>	i have a problem with the screensaver applet, i think it's a bug..  it will start up during a game like tremulous.
08:31	<Hodapp>	swarmz, would that excuse really work?
08:31	<Touru>	lastnode: Excellent, thanks. =)
08:31	<lastnode>	Hobart, #ubuntu-offtopic is fine for stuff like that
08:31	<lastnode>	sorry
08:31	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: there is a way to load compiz using a .xsession file in your home dir
08:31	<lastnode>	Hodapp, that was for you
08:31	<swarmz>	will 6.06 include support for gnome, kde and others?
08:31	<eobanb>	swarmz, ....????
08:31	<Seveas>	swarmz, no, just blackbox
08:31	<swarmz>	or will they be separate isos?
08:31	<jameswang>	How can shield the "join/quit" message?
08:31	<jameswang>	How can shield the "join/quit" message?
08:32	<jameswang>	How can shield the "join/quit" message?
08:32	<l_r>	swarmz, no, they have removed everything ..
08:32	<eobanb>	!patience
08:32	<robinl1>	Is it forbidden to grab the final iso (which is there) from the ubuntu server, meant for the mirrors?
08:32	<ubotu>	The people in this channel are volunteers. Please be aware there are a lot of questions, but only maybe few who might know the answer for you. Please be patient. Your attitude may determine their willingness to help you.
08:32	<Madpilot>	swarmz: they've always been seperate ISOs
08:32	<Hodapp>	Wait, ask one more time, jameswang
08:32	<JoseStefan>	jameswang: depends on your client
08:32	<robinl1>	The people in #ubuntu+1 did
08:32	<eobanb>	jameswang, it's a client-side setting
08:32	<robinl1>	now we got the final dapper
08:32	<robinl1>	:O
08:32	<herbheart>	swarmz, U6.06 will not come with Gnome. Only FVWM and Console
08:32	<Hodapp>	A little trigger-happy on the kickbans, I see.
08:32	<paniq>	what is LTS?
08:32	<eobanb>	long-term support.
08:32	<lastnode>	paniq, Long Term Support
08:33	<paniq>	ok
08:33	<paniq>	?
08:33	<swarmz>	i see
08:33	<khermans>	paniq, Long Testicle Slacks
08:33	<paniq>	what does it mean?
08:33	<lastnode>	Hodapp, trigger happy or not, if you act like a jackass, you will get kicked
08:33	<jrsims>	shoot. do I need to repoint my repositories to get dapper?
08:33	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: take a look at this: http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?id=916
08:33	<spikeb>	Hodapp, it's being going nuts here all night.
08:33	<Seveas>	Hodapp, yes, as long as people are going crazy I'll be quick on the trigger
08:33	<khermans>	paniq, you only need these pants if you have bug balls
08:33	<eobanb>	paniq, it indicates that 6.06 will be supported by canonical ltd for a long time.
08:33	<lastnode>	Hodapp, it's called natural selection. join #ubuntu-offtopic for everything offtopic, like i kept telling you
08:33	<Saj>	!drake
08:33	<ubotu>	it has been said that drake is a duck
08:33	<Saj>	:)
08:33	<Saj>	:O
08:33	<Saj>	duck:O:O:O
08:33	<z4k4ri4>	man drake
08:33	<eobanb>	Saj, do you have a question?
08:33	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I'm with Dapper Viaken !!!! thks man!!!!!!!!
08:33	<Hodapp>	OFFTOPIC
08:33	<Hodapp>	SHUT UP
08:33	<makelele>	has Dapper not been released yet ,what is the delay ?
08:33	<khermans>	drake is also a bug
08:33	<GianLuigiBuffon>	its cool
08:33	<Viaken>	No problem, GianLuigiBuffon! Hope you like it!
08:33	<eobanb>	makelele, read the topic please.
08:34	<z4k4ri4>	the mirorr
08:34	<lastnode>	wth?
08:34	<lastnode>	this is nuts
08:34	<imbrandon>	!+dapper
08:34	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
08:34	<Seveas>	lastnode, the channel is going nuts 
08:34	<Saj>	eoband: nop, apart from when dappy is coming:D
08:34	<paniq>	lastnode, dont try to bring order into the biggest party on earth ;)
08:34	<GianLuigiBuffon>	now I must reconfigure flash and that so tomorrow I guess that I must come again ahahahha :P
08:34	<Fujitsu>	makelele, what delay!?
08:34	<GianLuigiBuffon>	but all ok
08:34	<lastnode>	Seveas, apparently, yes :)
08:34	<jrsims>	Do I need to repoint my repositories to get the freshest dapper?
08:34	<GianLuigiBuffon>	just that
08:34	<GianLuigiBuffon>	thks buddie
08:34	<Fujitsu>	jrsims, no.
08:34	<khermans>	I've never seen so many people geek out over a release
08:34	<rahonavis>	this channel almost has 900 people in it.  about the size of a small town.
08:34	<jrsims>	yay
08:34	<eobanb>	jrsims, if you're already running dapper, then no.
08:34	<Seveas>	lastnode, I cleared out all bans yesterday 
08:34	<lastnode>	jrsims, dapper is coming at its freshest :) there are no separate repos
08:34	<bill>	hey bill
08:34	<bill>	lol
08:34	<bill>	its me
08:34	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: did you get my link?
08:34	<Fujitsu>	jrsims, the update tool will handle it for you
08:35	<jrsims>	JoseStefan: I did. Looking at it now.
08:35	<Graig>	wow that's alot of people.
08:35	<lastnode>	Seveas, to make room, eh? :)
08:35	<Seveas>	lastnode, hehe
08:35	<intelikey>	rahonavis very very very small town.
08:35	<dholbach>	khermans: me neither
08:35	<paniq>	lastnode, and dont forget, whenever you kick people, you have an influence on the stats. its better to say "on the day of release, #ubuntu had 1288239293 individuals" instead of just... 900 ;)
08:35	<jrsims>	I wonder of the latest Suse got this much fanfare...
08:35	<lastnode>	Seveas, when you got a moment for a /query, let me know
08:35	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: i suggest creating a new user for compiz/xgl
08:35	<khermans>	dholbach, says something about our community :-)
08:35	<jon_>	Ah, that's weird.  Dapper doesn't come with X-chat.  Had to install it.  but that's offtopic: my real point: Are you guys doing dapper support right now? or do I have to wait for the official release? :)
08:35	<Seveas>	lastnode, no need to ask for that 
08:35	<rahonavis>	intelikey, yes you are correct :)  perhaps with a goat that is mayor and drinks beer for lunch somewhere down in the rural areas of texas :)
08:35	<lastnode>	paniq, does anybody really care how many people were in #ubuntu? :)
08:35	<jrsims>	JoseStefan: good call
08:35	<eobanb>	wacky.  we're about to pass #gentoo as the most populous channel; at least temporarily.
08:35	<ryno>	This channel reminds me of the credits for a t.v. program. You can't keep up with all the text scrolling down the screen.
08:35	<lastnode>	Seveas, as in?
08:36	<Seveas>	khermans: that they're insane?
08:36	<paniq>	lastnode: independent blogs :D
08:36	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: that user will use the sample .xsession file
08:36	<Seveas>	lastnode, as in: you can always pm
08:36	<khermans>	Seveas, hey i didnt say it
08:36	<Seveas>	khermans, no, but you know it 
08:36	<intelikey>	rahonavis oh you've been here ?
08:36	<herbheart>	ryno - that's true and funny
08:36	<myleftfoot>	eoband, we did that already earlier. we went up to around 930
08:36	<paniq>	lastnode: when there are no stories to tell, there will be no hero to remember.
08:36	<rahonavis>	no intelikey though there exists such a town with a goat as a mayor.
08:36	<lastnode>	paniq, ooh, profound. :)
08:37	<khermans>	Seveas, i did write a script to SMS me in case I fall asleep and Dapper comes out ... cuz I'm gonna torrent it on my University gigabit
08:37	<Watson>	rahonavis: #ubuntu-offtopic
08:37	<scheuri>	hi all
08:37	<rahonavis>	understood
08:37	<paniq>	lastnode: ;)
08:37	<Watson>	scheuri: greetings are not permitted. Ubuntu talk only.
08:37	<Seveas>	khermans, what does the script do, measure the activity in here? 
08:37	<khermans>	Seveas, lol -- nah greps the releases page
08:37	<khermans>	Seveas, there's no RSS right?
08:37	<Jeeves_>	Seveas: Watch de traffic peaks on the main ix'es :)
08:37	<rahonavis>	i'm leaving until tomorrow when the final is out
08:38	<scheuri>	Watson: if that is the case...I greet you with my biggest smile I can produce...
08:38	<Seveas>	Jeeves_, lol, do you really think it'll show up?
08:38	<eobanb>	Watson, i don't think that's even been a rule before, or at least not enforced
08:38	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, I've been wondering why you often have that character on the end of your messages... Is it meant to be a smile?
08:38	<Jeeves_>	Seveas: No.
08:38	<jrsims>	Am I the only one who is thinking of ditching work so I can play with dapper?
08:38	<Seveas>	Fujitsu, yes
08:38	<Watson>	jrsims: if I had a job, I'm sure I'd ditch it.
08:38	<lastnode>	jrsims, work? what is work?
08:38	<eobanb>	jrsims, glad to hear you're so enthusiastic
08:38	<JoseStefan>	you could use an http HEAD request on the release directory
08:38	<Seveas>	Jeeves_, ahhhh, not even a single pixel in the RRD graphs? ;)
08:38	<Watson>	lastnode: this thing where you do stuff and get paid...legally
08:38	<KLineD>	I'll go to work so I can download there
08:38	<lastnode>	Watson, oh, that.
08:39	<l_r>	i think ubuntu actually wins the competition between all the other linux-based distros as italy will win the world cup..people will only talk about ubuntu and italy before july
08:39	<jrsims>	eobanb: yeah, it's weird. I just love ubuntu. It touches me in weird ways in weird places.
08:39	<Watson>	uh...
08:39	<khermans>	JoseStefan, ahh probably a better idea!
08:39	<Watson>	l_r: kinda depends on the market, I think, but who knows...
08:39	<Rambo3>	l_r: italy haha
08:39	<lastnode>	get em while it's hot, children
08:39	<l_r>	:)
08:39	<khermans>	JoseStefan, suggest imporvement to this ? http://kristianhermansen.com/tmp/DapperOut
08:39	<JoseStefan>	khermans: looking...
08:40	<eobanb>	khermans, hahaha
08:40	<jrsims>	I wonder how many people are running "sudo apt-get upgrade" right now...
08:40	<scheuri>	am I in ubuntu-offtopic or in the support channel? *I can be nagging as well, ;)*
08:40	<JoseStefan>	khermans: don't know perl :(
08:40	<Watson>	jrsims: I dunno, I'm on Slackware...
08:40	<Madpilot>	scheuri: you're in #ubuntu
08:40	<khermans>	Joetheodd, doh!
08:40	<jrsims>	Watson: why are you in here then?
08:40	<lastnode>	jrsims, 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
08:40	<neutrinomass>	F-Spot is in mono ?
08:40	<lastnode>	:)
08:40	<Watson>	jrsims: curiosity
08:40	<jrsims>	lastnode: yeah, I just ran it too. :)
08:40	<herbheart>	F-Spot sucks
08:41	<Watson>	jrsims: will likely try Ubuntu soon
08:41	<scheuri>	Madpilot: thanks, I perfectly know...;)..I was just joking
08:41	<Fujitsu>	Better, Seveas.
08:41	<lastnode>	jrsims, i think we're running dapper!! woot xD
08:41	<neutrinomass>	herbheart: Likely, but that's not the point ...
08:41	<ajmitch_>	neutrinomass: yes, it uses mono
08:41	<JoseStefan>	khermans: that part doesn't do the checking, does it?
08:41	<jrsims>	Watson: it really is good. I also used slackware for a while.
08:41	<Watson>	herbheart: I like digiKam, even with all of KDE's KraKK KoKaine apps
08:41	<khermans>	JoseStefan, yeah, in wget
08:41	<neutrinomass>	ajmitch_: Is obtaining a backtrace for a mono app any different? I think debug symbols don't show, right ?
08:41	<khermans>	JoseStefan, i grep the output of wget -- very hacky
08:41	<Saj>	t-18 minutes
08:41	<herbheart>	F-Spot runs on top of mono yes it does
08:41	<lastnode>	so wants to hit up a tropical DRP? - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SriLankanTeam/DapperReleaseParty :)
08:41	<intelikey>	Watson it's just a linux distro.
08:41	<Watson>	intelikey: I am aware...
08:42	<Phlosten>	aww no party near me :(
08:42	<Fujitsu>	Saj, I could have sworn it was 18 hours, not 18 minutes.
08:42	<lastnode>	Phlosten, organize one
08:42	<khermans>	JoseStefan, what is the syntax of a HEAD request?
08:42	<Watson>	What's with all the apps on Mono? I'm just curious why they use Mono.
08:42	<JoseStefan>	khermans: head should be more efficient, but you'd have to program it
08:42	<ajmitch_>	neutrinomass: you'll generally want the exception traceback that f-spot spits out - what problem are you having?
08:42	<Fujitsu>	Phlosten, just Adelaide and Sydney.
08:42	<Phlosten>	lastnode, will be a large party with 1 attendee :)
08:42	<Seveas>	khermans, lynx -dump -head
08:42	<khermans>	JoseStefan, I can use netcat
08:42	<lastnode>	Phlosten, get people!
08:42	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you'd have to send HTTP headers, with an if-modified-since flag
08:42	<neutrinomass>	ajmitch_: Just ran across bug #47807
08:42	<herbheart>	Watson, c# and the mono platform are pretty cool and powerful
08:42	<Watson>	except when they fail to work :\
08:42	<Saj>	fujitso: releasing @ 1st jun....18 minutes till 1st jun in california :)
08:42	<pschulz01>	apt-get install dapper-party
08:42	<Phlosten>	Fujitsu, not organising a partee in Melbourne?
08:43	<herbheart>	Watson, I suspect they were buiilt as proof of concepts
08:43	<Josh43>	18 hours? damn
=== carthik is now known as carthik_zzz
08:43	<Watson>	hmmm
08:43	<dhjohnson3>	i'm allergic to chunder
08:43	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you're method seems to work, you only need it for 1 day
08:43	<ajmitch_>	neutrinomass: wonderful
08:43	<Fujitsu>	Phlosten, no. YukiCuss and I have exams on Monday, so not much time.
08:43	<herbheart>	tomboy (built on mono) rocks
08:43	<vinboy>	hi
08:43	<Seveas>	Josh43, less than 18, maybe 7;)
=== jrsims is now known as EpicWang
08:43	<Josh43>	well, one bonus: the torrent is going to FLY
08:43	<khermans>	JoseStefan, don't wanna bog down the server
08:43	<vinboy>	is it possible to delete file from NTFS partition?
08:43	<Watson>	I only use one Mono app right now and it's text-based
08:43	<Seveas>	vinboy, no
08:43	<EpicWang>	weeoo weeoo weeoo!
08:43	<freakabcd>	Fujitsu, think of use in brissie dude!
08:43	<khermans>	Seveas, thanks for the tip -- ill use less bandwidth now :-)
08:43	<[1] Jess>	18 hours is their way of saying "go to bed"!  lol
08:43	<Josh43>	It's already 06/01 here (MST)
08:43	<vinboy>	thx Seveas
08:43	<freakabcd>	s/use/us/
08:43	<digerati>	this tomboy is cool :)
08:43	<Watson>	I think a lot of the GUI ones just had a lot of libs I never installed
08:44	<rpaul>	banshee is a good mono program
08:44	<lastnode>	pschulz01, Package dapper-party is a virtual package provided by: dapper-party-asia, dapper-party-us, dapper-party-africa
08:44	<lastnode>	;-)
08:44	<Fujitsu>	It's 16:44 here :)
08:44	<Watson>	I read about Banshee, supposedly it supported iTunes & DAAP?
08:44	<Linuturk>	asl
08:44	<Seveas>	ajmitch_, don't count on it
08:44	<Watson>	Linuturk: 89/h/ukraine
08:44	<gollum>	Where is it? Where is it!
08:44	<lastnode>	ajmitch_, i doubt it. then we'll have the "oh lookie, dapper does this"
08:44	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you just need some sort of "link checker", one should exist out there
08:44	<rpaul>	Watson: is certainly does
08:44	<freakabcd>	Watson, h == ?
08:44	<lastnode>	Mithrandir, i was in a hurry :p
08:44	<freakabcd>	lol
08:44	<rpaul>	http://banshee-project.org
08:44	<khermans>	JoseStefan, wait HEAD doesnt help here
08:44	<Mithrandir>	ajmitch_: hahahah.  More sane?  It'll take off completely!
08:44	<digerati>	what does dapper party do?
08:44	<gollum>	They promised it to us today, they did...
08:44	<lastnode>	digerati, man joke
08:45	<Watson>	rpaul: cool, I will have to figure out this Mono business... all these Java apps for iTunes are crappy
08:45	<sam__>	Josh43 It's 23:44 MST
08:45	<digerati>	k
08:45	<Linuturk>	you meet chicks at a dapper release party
08:45	<freakabcd>	lastnode, man joke: No manual entry for joke
08:45	<lastnode>	freakabcd, :)
08:45	<pschulz01>	has a dependency on beer
08:45	<Linuturk>	heh
08:45	<lastnode>	bash is so humourless sometimes
08:45	<JoseStefan>	khermans: head can monitor a change on the directory listing
08:45	<khermans>	Linuturk, i think at the Dapper release party everyone had their dongles out
08:45	<Josh43>	sam__; uhm... mst = -7 gmt
08:45	<scheuri>	why on earth are all like "tear them apart if they dont release today" and whatever...it is done when its done, isn't it?
08:45	<khermans>	JoseStefan, syntax?
08:45	<lastnode>	pschulz01, and your env variable SELF_ATTRACTIVENESS has to be set to "10"
08:45	<freakabcd>	lastnode, no. thats not bash. its man that complaining
08:45	<Watson>	because if I have it installed before you, that means I win.
08:45	<lastnode>	freakabcd, yes, semantics, man, bash whatever
08:45	<Mithrandir>	scheuri: we will release today, so that's ok.
08:45	<rixxon>	how can i disable the minimize animation?
08:46	<Josh43>	scheuri: Yeah, no kidding.. it's a couple months overdue in the first place
08:46	<herbheart>	Watson, I'd be wary of banshee only because of experience with F-Spot
08:46	<pschulz01>	renice 10
08:46	<freakabcd>	maybe you'll be happier if you did: alias woman='man'; woman joke
08:46	<gollum>	Curse the Shuttleworth! He promised us...
08:46	<freakabcd>	:p
08:46	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you need to send raw HTTP headers, i don't remember the syntax
08:46	<Linuturk>	khermans, a real dongle fest huh?
08:46	<scheuri>	Mithrandir: well, anyway...:)...I am sure you have enough pressure anyway
08:46	<Watson>	herbheart: any other nice interfaces for iTunes/DAAP access?
08:46	<Watson>	I use amaroK/Kaffeine for all else
08:46	<sam__>	Josh43: yup.
08:46	<JoseStefan>	khermans: "lynx" can show you, i think
08:46	<khermans>	Linuturk, i hope there were some dongle ports too
08:46	<Graig>	my computer is acting wierd.
08:46	<Josh43>	sam__: So; 00:46MST
08:46	<Linuturk>	you know your a nerd when you get that
08:47	<Rambo3>	yeah, just install popup blocker in lynx and java too
08:47	<JoseStefan>	khermans: "lynx" can make HEAD requests
08:47	<scheuri>	Josh43: yes, that might be true...on the other hand...its free...and you haven't paid for it and...I personally prefer polished LTS.capable distro over punctual release...but that is only me
08:47	<digerati>	lol dongle ports
08:47	<sam__>	Josh43: nope
08:47	<khermans>	apparantly ubuntu-women.org supports women using Ubuntu, so there must only be like 1.5% dognle ports available at the release parties, compared to 98.5% dongles
08:47	<Watson>	lol dumb innuendo
08:47	<sam__>	MDT is.
08:47	<herbheart>	Watson, I use mpd (musidpd.org) but I don't have an ipod
08:47	<Watson>	herbheart: I don't have an iPod either. But I am in a college dorm with a lot of people sharing music over iTunes.
08:47	<Madpilot>	khermans: mind the CoC, please...
08:47	<VR_>	herbheart: do you know of any equalizer plugins for mpd?
08:48	<khermans>	Madpilot, ok ill won
08:48	<Watson>	I used to use MusicPD on my very slow server - it was great
08:48	<khermans>	Madpilot, ill keep my CoC away from the dongle parties
08:48	<Josh43>	scheuri: Oh, of course - I'm not arguing, I'm just going over what I'm going to do with dapper final :) Been testing and loving it, now format
08:48	<intelikey>	scheuri no.  it's not "only you"  :)
=== pppoe_dude is now known as insomnd
08:48	<scheuri>	intelikey: thanks...;)
08:48	<herbheart>	VR_ no eq for mpd. I use an external hardware mixer with an eq
08:48	<EpicWang>	gonna go try my xgl sweetness!
08:48	<khermans>	ipod support in Dapper is awesome
08:48	<EpicWang>	later
08:48	<VR_>	herbheart: ah, ok.
08:48	<herbheart>	I've been searching for an eq for mpd since I met mpd
08:49	<scheuri>	Josh43: okay, no worries..:)...I am using it now for a couple of weeks myself...looks very good...still, loads of people complain and I thing that is unfair
08:49	<VR_>	herbheart: if it had one, i wouldn't use anything else
08:49	<La_PaRCa>	Gotta reformat for dapper. Been running the same testing rig since hoary and now its being eaten alive by bitrot.
08:49	<Watson>	herbheart: there are EQs for ALSA and OSS, most likely.
08:49	<scheuri>	Josh43: and I mean complain in a bad manner...not the constructive critics
08:49	<_kadaj_3>	hi all
08:49	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you might have to run that HEAD request on a specific file, i suggest the MD5SUMS file
08:49	<_kadaj_3>	is that ubuntu 6.06 released?
08:49	<Watson>	What backends does mpd have again? I know it has esd, OSS, ALSA... what about JACK?
08:49	<VR_>	Watson: i searched for that stuff too, but never foiund anything
08:49	<herbheart>	yes Eq for Alsa, OSS and Jack, I think are why mpd doesn't do eq
=== mumbles is now known as mumbles-laptop
08:49	<eobanb>	_kadaj_3, no.  read the topic please
08:49	<VR_>	found*
08:49	<La_PaRCa>	!+dapper
08:50	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
08:50	<Josh43>	scheuri: Yeah, there are alot of ppl who don't understand that it takes real work, not "omgz0rz; finsish it beotch'
08:50	<Saj>	t-10 minutes
08:50	<Saj>	:P:P:P:P
08:50	<_kadaj_3>	but it say today release
08:50	<scheuri>	Josh43: heh, couldn't point it out better...:)
08:50	<JoseStefan>	Can the output of lynx be done to stdout ?
08:50	<eobanb>	_kadaj_3, your point?
08:50	<Seveas>	_kadaj_3, today still has 17 hours and 10 minutes left
08:50	<_kadaj_3>	ok
08:50	<herbheart>	June 1 means anytime before June 2
=== La_PaRCa is now known as IsItOutYet
08:50	<Madpilot>	actually, it's not even June 1st yet, not for 11 more minutes
08:51	<khermans>	JoseStefan, i still dont see how to check the links in a HEAD request
08:51	<IsItOutYet>	it is on my time zone
08:51	<eobanb>	Madpilot, depends on where you are.
08:51	<JoseStefan>	khermans: working on something for you...
08:51	<herbheart>	it's almost 2 hours in june you liar
08:51	<khermans>	JoseStefan, im trying ti with nc, but only get the real header -- no content
08:51	<_kadaj_3>	are you all waiting it release
08:51	<Saj>	 mins
08:51	<[1] Jess>	so  what was all this talk of Ubuntu having to many bugs for 5 year LTS?  did that get somewhat resolved?
08:51	<Saj>	9mins
08:51	<Josh43>	Anyone: Is there an rss feed to the torrent when it drops?
08:51	<Unenvarjo>	here it's soon 10 am
08:51	<JoseStefan>	khermans: try this: lynx -head http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/MD5SUMS
08:51	<Saj>	if not i coming to kill ubuntu team :D :P
08:51	<Seveas>	eobanb, ubuntu counts in UTC 
08:51	<JoseStefan>	khermans: that will give you an idea
08:51	<eobanb>	[1] Jess, it's nothing to be worried about anymore.
08:51	<myleftfoot>	JoseStefan: i don't know about lynx but w3m has the  -dump_head       dump response of HEAD request into stdout
08:51	<khermans>	Josh43, i wish -- dont think so -- see my script
08:52	<neutrinomass>	[1] Jess: Dapper has tens of thousands of bugs. Like all distros, like all versions of Windows. The problem is the critical bugs, which AFAIK have been mostly resolved....
08:52	<scheuri>	[1] Jess: Ubuntu has over 10'000 pakets of software available...I guess we agree that it is impossible to have a perfect release...but still, most of the troubles are resolved I guess...
08:52	<Josh43>	khermans: Where at? SOmeone should get on that - all the torrent apps take rss feeds these days, and the more the merrier
08:52	<IsItOutYet>	khermans, can you link that there script so it uploads the corresponding rss feed?
08:52	<khermans>	JoseStefan, still not a head request there...but good call!
08:52	<JoseStefan>	myleftfoot: i think i found it for lynx, it's -dump
08:52	<intelikey>	lynx | tee file.name     works too
08:52	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, which RSS feed?
08:52	<scheuri>	[1] Jess: hoewever, if you encounter one...plesae let the devs know it with as many information possible
08:52	<JoseStefan>	khermans: this is the final statement:
08:52	<JoseStefan>	khermans: this is the final statement:
08:52	<Graig>	cept there's bugs in the gnome-screensaver package.
08:52	<encompass>	goodness the channel is nuts today
08:52	<JoseStefan>	oops
08:53	<JoseStefan>	khermans: lynx -dump -head http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/MD5SUMS
08:53	<Josh43>	JoseStefan: lol
08:53	<tdn>	When will it be released?!
08:53	<cam>	hi; is there a pkg to run a "no-ip" like server ?
08:53	<eobanb>	tdn, PLEASE read the topic.
08:53	<herbheart>	tdn, before June 2
08:53	<dholbach>	can't you guys just read ubuntu-announce@lists.ubuntu.com and be done with it?
08:53	<intelikey>	encompass in yellow
08:53	<tdn>	eobanb: hehe. Yeah. I know :)
08:53	<mjb>	Hey can 'Always on visible Workspace' be set via command line?
08:53	<eobanb>	tdn, if you know, then why did you ask?
08:53	<Bilford>	I think in 7 minutes
08:54	<tdn>	eobanb: just for fun.
08:54	<khermans>	JoseStefan, what, should I go by the E-Tag?
08:54	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you'd want to monitor the last-modified field
08:54	<Seveas>	dholbach, i wish they could....
08:54	<eobanb>	tdn, we get someone like you asking every 10 minutes, all right?
08:54	<JoseStefan>	khermans: etag is another way
08:54	<encompass>	intelikey: yellow?
08:54	<tdn>	eobanb: heh. Ok. Sorry :)
08:54	<Fujitsu>	eobanb, more like every two or three.
08:54	<IsItOutYet>	dholbach, let us have our fun with our geeky script and red-headed schoolgirl giddyness
08:54	<khermans>	JoseStefan, what is someone modifies, but not putting Dapper up?
08:54	<scheuri>	Seveas, dholbach...if they did, we'd miss all the fun here, righ? ;)
08:54	<JoseStefan>	khermans: at least you'll have a reason to take a look at the website
08:54	<dholbach>	IsItOutYet: I won't stop you guys.
08:55	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you'll know something has changed
08:55	<intelikey>	encompass the channel is nuts today... in yellow....  as in just before red.
08:55	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, if you think of a way to auto download the torrent, i don't know what the final name of the torrent will be
08:55	<dholbach>	scheuri: oh well - I guess there's enough of fun out there for eveyrone. :-)
08:55	<scheuri>	dholbach: ;)
08:55	<mjb>	Hey can 'Always on visible Workspace' be set via command line?
08:55	<IsItOutYet>	khermans, you could always use curl to get those headers as well
08:55	<[1] Jess>	does anyone know if the RC was taken as the "final" version?
08:55	<Fujitsu>	mjb, I don't think so.
08:55	<dholbach>	!patience
08:55	<JoseStefan>	khermans: remember that currently holds the RC from the 25th, so any change should be for the "final"
08:55	<Fujitsu>	[1] Jess, there have been a number of changes.
08:55	<ubotu>	The people in this channel are volunteers. Please be aware there are a lot of questions, but only maybe few who might know the answer for you. Please be patient. Your attitude may determine their willingness to help you.
08:55	<mjb>	cheers
08:55	<herbheart>	ok, that's enough channel watching for now...
08:56	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, ahh libraries!! who needs libs?? lol -- good ole backticks for phun
08:56	<herbheart>	gonna prepare my machines to seed the torrent
08:56	<scheuri>	uh...may we flood the channel with that patience-answer?? ;)
08:56	<z4k4ri4>	mjb: I think there's some utility that could do that but I forget the name
08:56	<herbheart>	!dapper
08:56	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
08:56	<herbheart>	I think the bot is cool :) . Later guys
08:56	<Seveas>	!dapper =~ s/24/18/
08:56	<ubotu>	Seveas: OK
08:57	<Fujitsu>	You know what we need?
08:57	<JoseStefan>	khermans: with a HEAD statement, stress on the server is reduced to a minimum
08:57	<Xore>	BEER
08:57	<khermans>	JoseStefan, yeah i know
08:57	<IsItOutYet>	khermans, use curl -I  http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/MD5SUMS then watch for modifications on the "last-modified" line
08:57	<philipacamaniac>	amen
08:57	<Fujitsu>	A bot that automatically says `!dapper' whenever somebody joins the channel.
08:57	<Mithrandir>	Seveas: actually, s/18/17/ now, I think.
08:57	<Xore>	lets turn this into a drunken party!
08:57	<herbheart>	Seveas, what did that command just do?
08:57	<Seveas>	Mithrandir, true, but I'm not changing it every hour 
08:57	<JoseStefan>	IsItOutYet, i was doing the same with lynx :S
08:57	<Fujitsu>	herbheart, replaced 24 with 18.
08:58	<digerati>	what's next an o.r.g.?
08:58	<Mithrandir>	Seveas: chicken. :-P
08:58	<Xore>	whoa...
08:58	<IsItOutYet>	JoseStefan, but curl is so much geekier!
08:58	<herbheart>	ahhhh... a perl bot
08:58	<intelikey>	herbheart updated the bots output for !dapper
08:58	<Seveas>	Mithrandir, hmm, eggs... 
08:58	<JoseStefan>	IsItOutYet, don't have it installed at the time
08:58	<IsItOutYet>	JoseStefan, of course, brownie points for using perl_curl or whatever the lib is called
08:58	<Bilford>	2 minutes
08:58	<ofer0>	I just love ubuntu... :)
08:58	<ofer0>	Need to get 829MB of archives.
08:58	<ofer0>	Wow, what a hit for the servers... damn
08:58	<JoseStefan>	IsItOutYet, i have a PHP link checker :P
08:58	<encompass>	I like the smily, never seen that... 
08:58	<encompass>	what char is that?
08:59	<Xore>	yea
08:59	<Fujitsu>	Japanese...
08:59	<scheuri>	[1] Jess: you may install RC right now and update it as soon as final hits the "shelfes"....
08:59	<Fujitsu>	I think.
08:59	<ofer0>	encompass, newline
08:59	<scheuri>	shelves
08:59	<Josh43>	Fujitsu: Yeah
08:59	<Bilford>	Chinese
08:59	<Xore>	i was just about to comment... that is the most awesome abuse of characters as a smiley ever
08:59	<encompass>	how do I do that?
08:59	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, curl is better!  ill whip up another version to get all the torrents and seed them as soon as they are available...
08:59	<Xore>	
08:59	<Fujitsu>	Katakana `tsu'?
08:59	<encompass>	umm but how?
08:59	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, even if you fall asleep
08:59	<myleftfoot>	PST 2006-06-01. still waiting with a big grin and a few beers
08:59	<Josh43>	Fujitsu: No, not sure what it is, but not that
08:59	<intelikey>	encompass hehhe iv'e never seen it.   it's a and teo small squars
08:59	<Mithrandir>	encompass: U+30C4 KATAKANA LETTER TU
08:59	<encompass>	how do you type it?
09:00	<[1] Jess>	scheuri:  that's what I was thinking....  but I'm waiting for ubuntu so that xubuntu can get their first release out :)
09:00	<JoseStefan>	khermans: oh well, glad to help anywyas, at least i came up with the basis
09:00	<IsItOutYet>	khermans, yay! I guess I woulda done it, but mine would have been messy shell script.
09:00	<philipacamaniac>	happy new years! oh wait...
09:00	<encompass>	so, tell me, is Mark from england or africa or what
09:00	<Fujitsu>	Mithrandir, wow... I was right! I haven't done much Japanese lately...
09:00	<encompass>	the guys seems everywhere
09:00	<scheuri>	[1] Jess: you can always install other desktops on whatever (k|x)ubuntu you have installed
09:00	<intelikey>	 a
09:00	<Madpilot>	encompass: he's from South Africa; Canonical is based in London
09:01	<Mithrandir>	Madpilot: no, it's not.
09:01	<Bilford>	it;s 07:00, but still not out
09:01	<Shotgun>	hey, does unbuntu have systems in place to prevent particular programs from using lots of memory? i ask as i have a c program with a hash table and the program seg faults unless i have a frustratingly small table size
09:01	<intelikey>	hmm i can't cp and paste it either.
09:01	<Mithrandir>	Madpilot: Canonical it's based in the Isle of Man.
09:01	<tapio_>	When I change root password, Sudo doesn't seem to update to the new root password, must i specify a 'sudo password' or something?
09:01	<[1] Jess>	true.  but I was reading and apparently there's bugs if you use kubuntu before hand
09:01	<mjb>	Has anyone used (wmctrl) for setting up windows as always on?
09:01	<VR_>	i hate that dapper splashscreen on bootup :(
09:01	<Madpilot>	Mithrandir: only the lawyer's office. The actual office is in London, I'm pretty sure
09:01	<Mithrandir>	tapio_: your sudo password is your user password, not your root password.
09:01	<eobanb>	tapio_, sudo uses the password for the user logged in
09:01	<eobanb>	!tell tapio_ about sudo
09:01	<DarkTower>	oo man its only changed to 18 hours. looking like 2nd
09:02	<Josh43>	    
09:02	<tapio_>	Oh, that sounds pretty unsecure. I'll read about it before complaining though. Thanks :)
09:02	<robitaille>	Madpilot:  officially Canonical is based at the Isle of Man...end of the official story  :)
09:02	<guillem101>	Bilford, 9:00 right here :-P
09:02	<JoseStefan>	a lot of people seem to be grabbing the daily
09:02	<robitaille>	Madpilot: unofficially, I think it is a bank office
09:02	<intelikey>	!tell tapio about sudo
09:02	<eobanb>	already did that, intelikey
09:02	<eobanb>	tapio_, using sudo is arguably only less secure if you unnecessarily enable the root user itself, as you have.
09:03	<Josh43>	,
09:03	<encompass>	Josh43: haha
09:03	<mjb>	does anyone here use wmcntrl ?
09:03	<intelikey>	eobanb arguably
09:03	<protocol1>	dapper eta?
09:03	<DarkTower>	Josh43: How come you typeing hiragana?
09:03	<Josh43>	.
09:03	<digerati>	its 2am in jamaica. going to bed
09:03	<mjb>	sorry thats wmcrtl
09:03	<tanek>	!upgrade
09:03	<ubotu>	methinks upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
09:03	<mjb>	q:q
09:03	<encompass>	mjb: is that the control pannel for Windowmaker?
09:03	<eobanb>	protocol1, read the topic please.
09:03	<mjb>	yup
09:04	<tapio_>	eobanb: Ok, so only the main user I set up when installing will have the ability to use sudo?
09:04	<JoseStefan>	it's the 1st on PST
09:04	<Josh43>	DarkTower: Enjoying the freedom of ubuntu smilies
09:04	<encompass>	mjb: yeah I use it alot
09:04	<eobanb>	tapio_, that's the default configuration for sudo, yes.
09:04	<DarkTower>	Josh43: oops katakana
09:04	<mjb>	can you set always on proerty on a window?
09:04	<Seveas>	gucharmap
09:04	<mejobloggs>	is ubuntu 64-bit very good? Or is it best to stick to 32 ?
09:04	<DarkTower>	Josh43: hehe sweet
09:04	<eobanb>	tapio_, it'd be pretty damn silly if every user on the machine was in sudoers
09:04	<Josh43>	DarkTower: THe last one was hebrew ;)
09:04	<mjb>	I want to be able to drag a window to a second screen and have it automatically set
09:04	<eobanb>	mejobloggs, it's fine except when trying to run certain 32-bit software.
09:05	<Madpilot>	tapio_: you can add other uses to the sudo list, if you want to
09:05	<eobanb>	mejobloggs, if you're running only free software, then you should have no problem at all.
09:05	<DarkTower>	Josh43: ubuntu rocks
09:05	<Madpilot>	other users, rather
09:05	<Josh43>	DarkTower: Hai!
09:05	<intelikey>	eobanb so if i try to hack your box and i use user name eoban  and you have used sudo in the last 15 minutes i have full root access ?
09:05	<voraistos>	Josh43, DarkTower: is there any good support on ubuntu for asian languages like on windows ?
09:05	<mejobloggs>	eobanb: sweet, thanks for that. Does 64 give any advantage?
09:05	<encompass>	mjb no idea
09:05	<Noah0504>	http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=659&slide=4&title=ubuntu+6.06+screenshots
09:05	<mjb>	encompass any ideas?
09:05	<Noah0504>	haha
09:05	<DarkTower>	Josh43: bonsai!!!!!!!!!!
09:05	<Josh43>	voraistos: MUCH better than windows
09:05	<Seveas>	ZOMG PONIES EDGY HAS BEEN RELEASED
09:05	<mjb>	oahh no worries
09:06	<Shotgun>	is there any cmd that allows programs to use more RAM?
09:06	<ice_1963>	:)
09:06	<Fujitsu>	voraistos, Japanese support is great!
09:06	<Shotgun>	or a particular program
09:06	<Josh43>	Seveas: ROXZORZ
09:06	<mjb>	cool program though...
09:06	<Healot>	64bit application has the memory space advantage, maybe processing speed too
09:06	<Seveas>	
09:06	<Madpilot>	Seveas: is this another op's cue to ban you now? ;)
09:06	<Healot>	tsu
09:06	<protocol1>	I am using the beta version....whats the command to upgrade to the official once its released?
09:06	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, that deserves a kick :P
09:06	<voraistos>	Josh43: can u explain? what about kanji support, spelling etc ?
09:06	<eobanb>	intelikey, first of all the box i'm running on right now is a powerbook with mac os x.  second of all, you'd have to know my user's password.  third of all, i'm not running ssh on here.  fourth i've changed sudo's config to be five minutes instead of 15
=== insomnd is now known as pppoe_dude
09:06	<eobanb>	intelikey, but you're welcome to try anyway...
09:07	<Seveas>	Fujitsu, true
09:07	<Healot>	voraistos: all even the interface could be in Japanese
09:07	<IsItOutYet>	
09:07	<protocol1>	I am using the beta version....whats the command to upgrade to the official once its released?
09:07	<Josh43>	voraistos: I'm not the best person to ask, but I have never had a problem reading, browsing, using different applications with Kanji (I don't understand it, but by default I can see it all works)
09:07	<eobanb>	protocol1, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
09:07	<JoseStefan>	Seveas, i could have slapped you with a large trout instead...
09:07	<protocol1>	ok
09:07	<Seveas>	JoseStefan, I prefer salmon
09:07	<intelikey>	eobanb i'm no hacker.   but you pointed out that, you do not use the 'default' sudo setup.    that's all i was about.  the default is not more secure.
09:08	<Fujitsu>	Tuna!
09:08	<JoseStefan>	Seveas: don't have salmon :(
09:08	<rixxon>	if i do ctrl+alt+backspace, will all programs end?
09:08	<Madpilot>	rixxon: yes
09:08	<Mithrandir>	intelikey: the default also requires you to control the same tty.
09:08	<dhjohnson3>	yes, forever
09:08	<rixxon>	Madpilot: ok thank you
09:08	<eobanb>	intelikey, then again, ubuntu doesnt run sshd by default, so i think the point is fairly moot.  if you care to discuss it more i'm in #ubuntu-offtopic
09:08	<voraistos>	Josh43: the thing is windows has got a very complete support for japanese, and i wouldnt expectGNU/linux to ave such a thing.
09:08	<Mithrandir>	rixxon: you're not guaranteed that, but yes, usually.
09:08	<Josh43>	yikes cute: 
09:08	<myleftfoot>	rixxon: the ones running in X yes
09:08	<KLineD>	later guys, happy dapper day and happy downloading :)
09:08	<rixxon>	i see
09:08	<guillem101>	rixxon, not the srervices
09:09	<lightstar>	is dapper officially out?
09:09	<eobanb>	voraistos, ubuntu has fairly good support for many languages, in fact
09:09	<eobanb>	lightstar, no
09:09	<eobanb>	lightstar, read the topic please
09:09	<mejobloggs>	i guess the download servers are going to be pretty maxed out when it is ou
09:09	<rapha>	will you use the torrent network for download?
09:09	<Jeeves_>	lightstar: See topic :)
09:09	<Josh43>	voraistos: I always had a problem with even trying to get the characters to show up properly.. If in doubt: try a livecd
09:09	<lightstar>	eobanb, oops..sorry
09:09	<eobanb>	rapha, you can if you like
09:09	<DarkTower>	voraistos: : Ubuntu rips XO support
09:09	<stjepan>	is dapper out?
09:09	<lightstar>	Jeeves_, missed the topic...oops
09:09	<mejobloggs>	my IP blocks torrents !! :(
09:09	<Healot>	voraistos: you can add Japanese or other language support in ubuntu
09:09	<rapha>	yea, I'm just curious who's going to use it
09:09	<eobanb>	stjepan, NO, please read the topic
09:10	<DarkTower>	stjepan: not yet
09:10	<eobanb>	rapha, for people already running ubuntu it's probably better just to use apt
09:10	<JoseStefan>	17 hours to go
09:10	<DarkTower>	!dapper
09:10	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:10	<intelikey>	Mithrandir not really.  it only requires a tty takeover for the timed method  but the user password is the point.   not just the timed method.    but i know and don't dispute that a properly setup sudo is a more secure approach.
09:10	<Josh43>	voraistos: Case and point:  means system :)
09:10	<DarkTower>	eobanb: is the upgrade from breezy stable??
09:11	<eobanb>	DarkTower, what do you mean, exactly
09:11	<redraslo>	DarkTower: do you mean the current RC?
09:11	<Fujitsu>	Case in point, you mean, Josh43?
09:11	<eobanb>	DarkTower, using dist-upgrade i've had basically no real problems, and i even upgraded to dapper about a month ago.
09:11	<voraistos>	i already am using ubuntu folks;) ,and i am not talking about the interface language :p. (and yea i have a JP keyboard.) however ill take a look into that. try to use (just for a test) a JP keyboard with language bar and all that shit in windows, thats just awesome. I respect MS for hat.
09:11	<DarkTower>	eobanb: you were saying i thought that people already running ubuntu should use apt-get to upgrade instead of new install, but maybe i misread soz
09:11	<Josh43>	Fujitsu: Nope
09:11	<eobanb>	DarkTower, that's right.
09:12	<DarkTower>	eobanb: oo, k. this is my work machine though. would be a bit scared lol.
09:12	<Healot>	voraistos: nihongo wo shaberu?
09:12	<eobanb>	DarkTower, well you should be backing up your data regardless.
09:12	<rixth>	RIP The Pirate Bay. http://piratebay.org/
09:12	<OmniD>	voraistos: I'm sure there is a good enough IME equivelent
09:12	<eobanb>	rixth, take it to #ubuntu-offtopic please
09:12	<voraistos>	Healot: yep, more for my girl than myself ;)
09:12	<DarkTower>	Healot: nihongo go hanashimas
09:13	<OmniD>	*no
09:13	<DarkTower>	eobanb: thanks for the help. What would be best, just back up my home directory?
09:13	<eobanb>	DarkTower, probably.
09:13	<Nigel>	how is everyone going to know when it is released?  hitting refresh on the http://www.ubuntu.com/download page?
09:13	<OmniD>	YEP
09:13	<scheuri>	DarkTower: you should do that everytime...
09:13	<OmniD>	Mines on auto-refresh Nigel
09:13	<voraistos>	OmniD: yea i have to take a look into that, so i can convert my girlfriend to ubuntu ;)
09:13	<Fujitsu>	Nigel, looking for the news on Ubuntu.com... Reading ubuntu-announce... Reading here...
09:13	<Healot>	voraistos: you can either change the keyboardto Japanese and isntall iimf/anthy/scim for Japanese input/dictionary
09:14	<paniq>	hm
09:14	<DarkTower>	eobanb: cheers. will it change the theme and look all new and everything. Dont mean to sound like a kid about a new toy lol
09:14	<eobanb>	DarkTower, i don't expect you to encounter any major problems when doing dist-upgrade, but you should hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
09:14	<paniq>	where in my user profile are the application menus stored?
09:14	<ubuntubes>	any alternative program that can utilize bandwidth?

09:14	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: may you be more specific?
09:14	<Linuturk>	!dapper
09:14	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:14	<dizz1>	NO! NOT YET
09:14	<DapperLad>	Dapper just got released!!!!
09:14	<joshhendo>	aztun: yes
09:14	<eobanb>	DarkTower, doing sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will prompt you to either use your existing gnome config or replace it with the package maintainer's version
09:14	<occhi>	so when the new release is out, can you just do a apt-get distupgrade?
09:14	<DapperLad>	Just kidding...
09:14	<voraistos>	Healot: yea that sounds good. scim is pretty old, i heard about it long time ago

09:15	<DarkTower>	eobanb:  sweeet thanks again
09:15	<intelikey>	well  i haven't seen anyone for tech help in a while.   sorry if i missed you.     i'm outa here.  dapper can release without me just fine.
09:15	<joshhendo>	aztun: I will get you a link
09:15	<occhi>	so when the new release is out, can you just do a apt-get distupgrade?
09:15	<eobanb>	occhi, yes.  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.
09:15	<IsItOutYet>	occhi, yes
09:15	<scheuri>	occhi: actually you can do it right away already...
09:15	<protocol1>	occhi, yep

09:16	<occhi>	just wondering what to do when the official one comes out
09:16	<aztun>	thx joshhendo
09:16	<scheuri>	occhi: just keep it updated...
09:16	<eobanb>	occhi, please read the topic...
09:16	<ubuntubes>	scheuri : Actually I want to allocate bandwidth to a specific pc, and how do I do that?
09:16	<_kadaj_3>	hahaha
09:16	<voraistos>	intelikey: but the nu ubuntu version release is more important than changing the millenium !
=== mumbles-laptop is now known as mumbles-out
09:16	<dholbach>	occhi: you can upgrade now already
09:16	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: ah, okay...well...no idea..never done that with my computer (only router stuff)
09:16	<rapha>	they should release the next version at 0:00 next time  - they would save a lot of bandwidth from all the people reloading all the time or using scripts :))
09:17	<occhi>	eoband, im confused as to what i missed in the topic?
09:17	<occhi>	eobanb*
09:17	<gambit>	in dpkg-reconfigure locales, how do i select the box
09:17	<_kadaj_3>	:D
09:17	<eobanb>	occhi, how about the part where it says 'Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours!'
09:17	<scheuri>	gambit: spacebar doenst work?
09:17	<occhi>	eobanb, my question was regarding how to upgrade my current install when it is released
09:17	<Healot>	my personal favorite of Japanese Input >	IIMF+Anthy engine
09:18	<dhjohnson3>	so what exactly are the developers or whomever doing right now?
09:18	<gambit>	spacebar nor x or #
09:18	<Flannel>	occhi: you don't need to do anything.  update-notifier will ask you if you want to update
09:18	<hyphenated>	dhjohnson3: hiding ;-)
09:18	<Xore>	dhjohnson3: enjoying a beer and watching us all panic
09:18	<dhjohnson3>	d'oh!
09:18	<scheuri>	dhjohnson3: probably they are at work? (its about 0800 in London, isnt it?)
09:18	<dhjohnson3>	double do'h!
09:18	<ubuntubes>	scheuri : so only router can do that? how about the ubuntu server? can it be?
09:18	<timfrost>	!upgrade
09:18	<ubotu>	well, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
09:18	<occhi>	thanks Flannel, ive never used this distro till, about 5 minutes ago. just getting the feel for it and all :)
09:18	<protocol1>	dhjohnson3, doing finishing touch-ups
09:18	<protocol1>	;)
09:19	<dhjohnson3>	but wouldn't they have been at work since way before midnight london time?
09:19	<gambit>	scheuri: nvm,  ty vmuch
09:19	<Flannel>	occhi: you'll have an icon on the top right of your screen, should be pretty apparent.
09:19	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: if you configure your ubuntu server to be a router (having at least 2 NICs) then you may...yes.
09:19	<scheuri>	gambit: easy...:)
09:19	<dhjohnson3>	protocoll, so how do they decide when to cut things off?
09:19	<eobanb>	dhjohnson3, they just decide
09:19	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: but I never had a linux system configured as router...so I am no help here, sorry
09:19	<protocol1>	when all of thier objectives been completed
09:19	<Nigel>	I wonder what the differences will be between the latest RC and the final release.  I'm going to feel like I wasted my time waiting for the final if it's not something significant.
09:20	<paniq>	nigel, no big difference
09:20	<protocol1>	there is a doc about the dapper goals somewhere I forget
09:20	<ubuntubes>	scheuri : :)
09:20	<scheuri>	Nigel it is quite unlikely a big diff...
09:20	<paniq>	nigel, i think some random icon touchups a few small updates, nothing fancy.
09:20	<eobanb>	Nigel, it's not anything significant, really.
09:20	<IsItOutYet>	Nigel, probably wont be a big difference. That why its called a "Release Candidate"
09:20	<Burgundavia>	protocol1: what sort of goals?
09:20	<eobanb>	paniq, not even that.
09:20	<paniq>	eobanb: from what i saw on my update manager list, yes.
09:20	<protocol1>	well....theres a doc on it somewhere in wiki
09:20	<JoseStefan>	i just want the ISOs
09:20	<protocol1>	!dapper
09:20	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:21	<protocol1>	woops
09:21	<paniq>	eobanb: between rc1 and today there were a few package updates, one was related to icon artwork
09:21	<paniq>	eobanb: but i wasnt able to spot the difference.
09:21	<ubuntubes>	what is the command to upgrade ubuntu 5.10 to 6.06? sudo apt-get upgrade ??

09:21	<ubotu>	voraistos: I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/

09:29	<scheuri>	Hisakasex: it may be considered spam because there is no reverse-DNS?
09:30	<DarkTower>	eobanb: thx
09:30	<eobanb>	DarkTower, on a similar note, why are you running a webserver on your work station
09:30	<ubuntubes>	scheuri : yes win XP cannot log in the users to my server1, just during the first win XP logon screen
09:30	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: sorry, cant help then...you might be more lucky at samba-channel

09:33	<DarkTower>	im watching the seconds, the go nice and quick
09:34	<Mithrandir>	Fujitsu: there's an infinite amount of points in time where it will not be released.
09:34	<eobanb>	Mithrandir, not according to quantum theory, actually.
09:34	<dhjohnson3>	lingwo
09:34	<Fujitsu>	Hey, Singaporekid!
09:34	<jamie>	i thought it was gonna be out this morning :-(, oh well
09:34	<Skiddles^>	:D
09:34	<DarkTower>	Mithrandir: thanks archilles lol
09:34	<ubuntubes>	eobanb yes I did.. but still cant get into server1
09:34	<Fujitsu>	Mithrandir, but they countdown was to June 2, 0:00Z.
09:34	<Flannel>	eobanb: there are though, because of the uncountability of irrational numbers.
09:34	<tritium>	eobanb: time is not an energy level
09:34	<Fujitsu>	Thus, my point was valid.
09:34	<koasd>	less than 16 hours from now
09:34	<axion`>	1,000,000th time today, is it out yet?
09:35	<eobanb>	ubuntubes, then it's not an ubuntu problem, but in fact, a windows problem
09:35	<koasd>	no
09:35	<koasd>	still not
09:35	<Seveas>	
09:35	<eobanb>	tritium, doesnt matter.
09:35	<axion`>	=(
09:35	<ubuntubes>	eobanb : I guess it is because the configuration in smb.conf
09:35	<jameyg>	imagine how busy and overloaded this channel will be when it *is* actually out :-)
09:35	<Flannel>	Seveas: boxes!
09:35	<Seveas>	Flannel, PONIES
09:35	<Skiddles^>	_
09:35	<axion`>	i was gone for a few hours! i didnt get the latest
09:35	<shadow_mil>	does (k)ubuntu have agpgart support?
09:35	<tarzeau>	it's out already?
09:35	<eobanb>	tritium and flannel, it's called planck time
09:35	<tritium>	eobanb: yes, it does, actually.  Time is uncountably infinite
09:35	<DarkTower>	Flannel: real numbers, not necessarily irrational
09:35	<cef>	!pony
09:36	<amac>	its the early morning hours in the US
09:36	<ubotu>	ZOMG! PONIES!
09:36	<rapha>	!dapper
09:36	<Skiddles^>	omg ponies
09:36	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:36	<Mithrandir>	POOOOOOOOOOOONY
09:36	<Unenvarjo>	Pony!
09:36	<eobanb>	stop please.
09:36	<Seveas>	!forget pony
09:36	<ubotu>	Seveas: i forgot pony
09:36	<Flannel>	eobanb: I'll gladly continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic ;)
09:36	<Skiddles^>	>:3 OMG LIONS GET IN THE CAR
09:36	<rapha>	9:37 o' clock here
09:36	<Soir>	I have a feeling it'll just get released as close as possible to the start of the working day today o.o
09:36	<nomin>	dapper drake will be released today?
09:37	<shadow_mil>	does (k)ubuntu have agpgart support?
09:37	<amac>	once it hits afternoon you'll have lots of "my computer caught fire cause of ubuntu" statements
09:37	<scheuri>	note to myself: avoid this channel 48h before a release
09:37	<tritium>	yes, shadow_mil
09:37	<shadow_mil>	tritium: how can I install it?
09:37	<Seveas>	scheuri, 24 is enough 
09:37	<Flannel>	noob-saibot: do try and stop that.
09:37	<ubuntubes>	what is the actual time for ubuntu 6.06 out?
09:37	<BeNi>	how to get dapper?? just to type apt-get dist-upgrade ?
09:37	<Skiddles^>	Oh yeah, Dapper is going to be released, holy crap I forgot.
09:37	<nomin>	I heard there are quite a few bugs still in dapper
09:37	<scheuri>	Seveas: ;)
09:37	<DarkTower>	Flannel: why would you be counting all the irrational number. pi 1 pi 2 lol
09:37	<rapha>	!dapper
09:37	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:37	<tritium>	shadow_mil: it's a kernel module, so you can make sure it's loaded, if it's not already
09:37	<ompaul>	note to scheuri explain your presence
09:38	<Fujitsu>	Good point, ompaul.
09:38	<scheuri>	ompaul: explanation: the naive thought, that there MIGHT be a question I may be able to answer and help
09:38	<shadow_mil>	tritium: Thanks, what does that mean exactly?
09:38	<eobanb>	nomin, there are surely remaining bugs, but the number is quite manageable now, to the point where dapper is ready for production use.
09:38	<BeNi>	how to get dapper?? just to type apt-get dist-upgrade ?
09:38	<ompaul>	hehe
09:38	<DarkTower>	Flannel: sorry, am i pushing my luck
09:38	<ompaul>	!upgrade
09:38	<ubotu>	[upgrade]  Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
09:38	<tritium>	shadow_mil: if you "lsmod | grep agpgart", and it's listed in the output, you already have the module loaded
09:39	<scheuri>	ompaul: enjoy
09:39	<ompaul>	it is my intention to do so
09:39	<rapha>	have a look at ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/
09:39	<tritium>	ompaul: duck, by chance?  :)
09:39	<ompaul>	tritium, burnt dragon
09:39	<shadow_mil>	agpgart                34888  1 intel_agp
09:39	<Fujitsu>	:O
09:39	<BadriNarayan>	why is rapha ejected?
09:39	<Fujitsu>	rapha mentioned the forbidden URL!
09:40	<BadriNarayan>	oh i c
09:40	<Flannel>	DarkTower: well, the innumerability of real numbers comes from the innumerability of irrational numbers.  Or at least, while we're talking about "infinite points" between now and dapper release.  since it's not infinite integers.  hmm, I've forgotten rational numbers.  oh well, it's been a long day.
09:40	<Seveas>	for spreading crap
09:40	<dholbach>	hey mvo
09:40	<tritium>	shadow_mil: then, you've got it loaded.
09:40	<shadow_mil>	ok cool :)
09:40	<dholbach>	LOL
09:40	<Seveas>	mvo, lol 
09:40	<ubuntubes>	where I can get help ubuntu samba ??
09:40	<scheuri>	he
09:40	<Fujitsu>	mvo, l
09:40	<Fujitsu>	mvo, lo
09:40	<Soir>	It's a forbidden URL? o.o
09:40	<Fujitsu>	mvo, lol
09:40	<tritium>	hi dholbach :)
09:40	<dholbach>	hey tritium
09:40	<eobanb>	mvo, enough please
09:40	<Seveas>	GIMME A D GIMME AN H GIMME AN O GIMME AN L GIMME A B GIMME AN A GIMME A C GIMME AN H
09:40	<Seveas>	DHOLBACH!
09:40	<dholbach>	WOHOOO!
09:41	<Flannel>	holy cow.
09:41	<Fujitsu>	GI'IM A KICK.
09:41	<Soir>	well, if you can't get to the nearest ubuntu party, might as well be at the big one online ;p
09:41	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: your problem seems not specific UBUNTU samba...just samba...there is a channel here that deals with samba
09:41	<montbazin>	hi guys ! Can somebody tell me if there is something like "Band in a Box" for Ubuntu
09:41	<Flannel>	montbazin: what is "band in a box"?
=== Ben is now known as bvanaerde
09:42	<DarkTower>	Flannel: sorry, uncountability has nothing to with irrational number, they are special number that can't be expressed as a/b  for integers ab where b !=0. real numbers are all the numbers on the number line, they are the uncountables, not trnsendentals and the like of i, e and pi
09:42	<Fujitsu>	DarkTower, this is off-topic :)
09:43	<DarkTower>	Fujitsu: ok sorry
09:43	<montbazin>	Flannel: it's a music software which generates an accompagniment to play with.
=== waky is now known as waky|off
09:43	<BadriNarayan>	about ubuntu's samba: isn't there anybody else who thinks "security=share" should be default?
09:43	<Fujitsu>	No.
09:43	<dooglus>	Josh43: no, less than 18 hours
09:43	<Flannel>	DarkTower: I'm fully aware of what irrational numbers are.  It's just been a long day.
09:43	<DarkTower>	BadriNarayan: no security=share is not secure. Linux doesnt put unsafe things as defualt
09:43	<tritium>	Flannel: the irrationals are countably infinite, actually.  See Cantor's diagonilization proof for details
09:43	<Josh43>	dooglus: ?
09:43	<joshhendo>	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/ ?
09:43	<BadriNarayan>	I see thanks darktower
09:44	<tritium>	diagonalization, even
09:44	<Fujitsu>	joshhendo, your point?
09:44	<nomin>	in what ways is dapper better than breezy?
09:44	<DarkTower>	Flannel: sorry about that, same here, was being argumentative.
09:44	<Flannel>	tritium: right, that's the point.
09:44	<myleftfoot>	joshhendo: that's just the daily build
09:44	<joshhendo>	ok
09:44	<BeNi>	!upgrade
09:44	<joshhendo>	I just wanted to know if that was the final or what :S
09:44	<scheuri>	nomin: newer software, more implementations, new software
09:44	<BadriNarayan>	bad question
09:45	<BadriNarayan>	very risky
09:45	<tritium>	Flannel: your point is what?
09:45	<scheuri>	nomin: where newer software means that software from breezy is in it in a newer version and more software was added
09:45	<nomin>	cool
09:45	<halibut>	montbazin, nothing that I know of
09:45	<rpedro_>	montbazin: take a look at  http://ubuntustudio.com/
09:45	<nomin>	I hope qjoypad is in dapper
09:46	<halibut>	montbazin, you might be able to run BIAB under linux though
09:46	<nomin>	qjoypad should be available in every distro
09:46	<dooglus>	Josh43: I had my buffer scrolled up.  I saw "08:43 < Josh43>	18 hours? damn" and replied...  about an hour too late.
09:46	<Seveas>	!info qjoypad dapper
09:46	<nomin>	http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/
09:46	<scheuri>	nomin: I am sure the homepage will have information about the difference
09:46	<Flannel>	tritium: nothing, it's dead.  at a micro scale, irrational numbers are infinite.
09:46	<halibut>	montbazin, do you have the 2006 version?
09:46	<dooglus>	Flannel: no numbers are infinite
09:46	<scheuri>	nomin: gimme a sec I will check
09:46	<DarkTower>	dooglus: yes they are
09:46	<nomin>	qjoypad is a keystroke and mouse emulator for a joystick or gamepad.  It's very useful but no available on ubuntu yet.
09:46	<dooglus>	DarkTower: which ones?
09:46	<Flannel>	dooglus: how many integers are there then?
09:47	<JoseStefan>	isn't Pi infinite?
09:47	<Josh43>	dooglus: Lol - yeah, only a little late. Hey, it's 2am here; where's my Dapper? ;P
09:47	<tritium>	Flannel: scale is irrelevant.  They are countably infinite, Flannel, dooglus.
09:47	<dooglus>	Flannel: all the integers are finite
09:47	<DarkTower>	dooglus: tell me all the decimal places of pi
09:47	<dooglus>	DarkTower: pi is irrational
09:47	<tritium>	no, dooglus.  Okay, let's take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
09:47	<DarkTower>	tritium: he knows that i misunderstood him, its finished
09:47	<dooglus>	DarkTower: but it's not infinite
09:47	<dooglus>	DarkTower: in fact it's less than 7
09:47	<Flannel>	I agree. offtopic for math stuffs.
09:47	<tritium>	dooglus: the _set_ is infinite
09:48	<dooglus>	tritium: yes, that's true.  but the numbers aren't infinite
09:48	<DarkTower>	dooglus: thats the very definition of irational
09:48	<scheuri>	nomin: I am afraid, I cant find anything
09:48	<Seveas>	DarkTower, #ubuntu-offtopic
=== bvanaerde is now known as ben|away
09:48	<BadriNarayan>	Suppose I wish to write a wishlist for shares-admin to allow adding samba users through GUI. Which package in launchpad should I look at?
09:48	<JoseStefan>	it's a matter of interpretation
09:48	<Seveas>	BadriNarayan, gnome-system-tools
09:48	<nomin>	scheuri:  I'm not too surprised.  I think it's the only program for emulating keystrokes and a mouse with a joystick on linux.
=== ben|away is now known as bvanaerde
09:48	<BadriNarayan>	Thank you Seveas
09:48	<DarkTower>	Seveas: sorry. i said id stop and kept doing it. I wont continue.
09:49	<MadMerC>	can anyone tell me how to make thunderbird my default mail prog ??
=== bvanaerde is now known as ben|away
09:49	<McNutella>	it STILL Not released then ?
09:49	<Fujitsu>	!dapper
09:49	<scheuri>	McNutella: CET is not the only timezone
09:49	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:49	<JoseStefan>	McNutella, view topic
09:49	<Almenfors>	have they released dapper yet?
09:49	<scheuri>	LOL
09:49	<Almenfors>	oh nm
09:49	<McNutella>	i read topic, obviously.. feeling a little dissapointed
09:49	<scheuri>	;)
09:50	<dholbach>	McNutella: disappointed? why that?
09:50	<Almenfors>	u answerd it as i asked hehe and ill check the topic now. sorry =)
09:50	<JoseStefan>	i call a vote re-update the hours on the topic
09:50	<McNutella>	how do you work that out JoseStefan
09:50	<montbazin>	halibut: no I dont have BB , what is BIAB and where can I get it2006
09:51	<Almenfors>	is there a version of utorrent for linux? or something similar?
09:51	<_nano_>	ktorrent
09:51	<JoseStefan>	McNutella, i dont know, but it's been like an hour since the last topic update
09:51	<scheuri>	Almenfors: yes there are
09:51	<Kr0ntab>	maintainers are at their own little pre-release function gettin drunk off their butts... laughin at us.  :-)
09:51	<Burgundavia>	Almenfors: ubuntu already has a bittorrent client built in
09:51	<scheuri>	Almenfors: do a "aptitude search torrent" in your CLI
09:51	<Almenfors>	Burgundavia, that one built in sux.
09:51	<McNutella>	JoseStefan,  I guess a lttle mathematics is in order then.. 17 or so hours then I take it LOL
09:51	<Ocult>	what time will release the new version ????
09:51	<Ocult>	:O
09:51	<Ocult>	what time ?
09:52	<McNutella>	Ocult, shhh
09:52	<JoseStefan>	McNutella, indeed
09:52	<montbazin>	rpedro_: thanks I'll check that

09:52	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
09:52	<Ocult>	[McNutella] : ?
09:52	<halibut>	montbazin, biab = band in a box
09:52	<McNutella>	Ocult, do what I did, look at the topic after asking
09:52	<eobanb>	Ocult, read the topic next time first
09:52	<Ocult>	|eobanb|: but i wanna more details
09:52	<montbazin>	halibut: OK
09:52	<Ocult>	[eobanb] : it can be more precise
09:52	<Ocult>	?
09:52	<McNutella>	Ocult, tough :)
09:52	<eobanb>	perhaps you missed the part, Ocult, where it says '(NO, we cannot be more precise)'
09:53	<BadriNarayan>	It is rather simple:ocult keep wanting
09:53	<mcmahons>	i don't understand why you are getting angry about people asking about when dappers coming out. obviously people are excited, why rain on their parade?
09:53	<eobanb>	mcmahons, because someone asks every five minutes.
09:53	<JoseStefan>	Ocult, if you find anything, you tell us, and we will update everyone
09:53	<Ocult>	[[eobanb] ] : OH.. my anxious made me blank
09:53	<g_c_c>	im probably the only person that doesn't know this, but does kde 3.5 have better accessability support?
09:53	<Fujitsu>	mcmahons, people ask excruciatingly regularly.
09:53	<scheuri>	mcmahons: it is not the asking itself, but probably the numbers of people asking it...and it is written ALL over
09:53	<Ocult>	JoseStefan: in bittorrente have the final version
09:53	<scheuri>	mcmahons: people tend to be lazy when it comes to reading...:)
09:53	<EmxBA>	when is dapper going to be released
09:54	<EmxBA>	really
09:54	<philipacamaniac>	It will be released at exactly^F^F^F^F^F^F^F^F (transmission terminated)

09:54	<Seveas>	tritium, he said please 
09:54	<McNutella>	eobanb, dont be like that
09:54	<JoseStefan>	Ocult: it's not "final" until the "offical" announcment
09:54	<mcmahons>	scheuri: i read it, but for example jeff waugh was in here before. surely he knows when it's being released. i was just hoping someone knew
09:54	<g_c_c>	i dunno, be like that eobanb
09:54	<scheuri>	tritium: actually...he was...he said please...sorry...couldnt resist

10:00	<JoseStefan>	zaphod_: is that "official" ?
10:00	<jdub>	mcmahons: that
10:00	<zaphod_>	look at the forum link
10:00	<Seveas>	JoseStefan, no
10:00	<jdub>	mcmahons: there's not much in the way of package uploading going on now...
10:01	<lsuactiafner>	<lsuactiafner>	Seveas : i got a disk which is 52G full on a running system, another disk which is 60G full, i want to rsync
10:01	<lsuactiafner>	               the 52G to the 60G, but when i try it the 60G of free space fills up, why would that be?        rsync --exclude
10:01	<lsuactiafner>	               /mnt/ --links -aH --partial --progress --exclude=/tmp* --exclude=/proc* --exclude=/sys* / /mnt/01/PC
10:01	<Flannel>	g-nome: dapper beta was released a week or two ago.
10:01	<JoseStefan>	i was using reverse psicology so he could answer his own question :/
10:01	<g-nome>	no, but i mean the *first* dapper thing
10:01	<mcmahons>	jdub: ok cool
10:01	<scheuri>	werent flights betas too=
10:01	<scheuri>	?
10:01	<ubuntu>	jkkjkhkjjjkghk
10:01	<jdub>	scheuri: flights were regarded as 'alpha'
10:01	<ubuntu>	ldkgiiui
10:01	<g-nome>	i just want to know how LONG the period of testing was
10:01	<scheuri>	jdub: ah, okay
10:01	<Flannel>	haha, nice Seveas.
10:02	<kakalto>	when's the countdown? xD
10:02	<neutrinomass>	g-nome: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseSchedule
10:02	<eobanb>	best reason ever
10:02	<JoseStefan>	development took 9 months, didn't it?
10:02	<Auckland_Pig>	whats the free node record for no. of users on IRC channel?
10:02	<dholbach>	JoseStefan: 6 months + 6 weeks
10:02	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, if i had to guess, it's probably around 2000 users
10:02	<g-nome>	neutrinomass: that resumes it quite well - ty
10:02	<JoseStefan>	ok
10:02	<Auckland_Pig>	2000... hmmm thats a lot
10:02	<OmniD>	So is this one of the bigger updates?
10:03	<Auckland_Pig>	hope it will reach 1000 users :)
10:03	<eobanb>	OmniD, uhhh yeah.
10:03	<OmniD>	To say the least or what
10:03	<OmniD>	I wouldn't know eobanb sorry
10:03	<JoseStefan>	1000 on the first 3 days
10:03	<g-nome>	will dapper always have the new updates for software?
10:03	<g-nome>	and for the kernel??
10:03	<philipacamaniac>	g-nome: only security updates
10:03	<tritium>	g-nome: security updates, yes
10:04	<McNutella>	g-nome, one would assume so
10:04	<bliss_>	most folks have in some form or other already just getting ready to pop the cork
10:04	<jdub>	g-nome: no, focus post-release is security and major bugfixes
10:04	<JoseStefan>	g-nome: there will be different repositories for different need
10:04	<JoseStefan>	needs
10:04	<Auckland_Pig>	i did "update-manager -d" and am getting too many updates... how do i disable it?
10:04	<scheuri>	McNutella: this assumption is quite shortsighted in business and stability manner
10:04	<Lukketto>	!dapper
10:04	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
10:04	<zjimbo>	I feel iv been lied to 1st June 4:00PM and still no Dapper
10:04	<McNutella>	meh
10:04	<eobanb>	zjimbo, it's not 2 june yet
10:04	<McNutella>	hahahah
10:04	<Auckland_Pig>	woo hooo 18 hours :)
10:04	<jdub>	zjimbo: there's a lot of 1st June to go around teh world (hint: people doing the release are on UK time)
10:05	<scheuri>	zjimbo: there are mor than just one timezone in this world...
10:05	<JoseStefan>	some countries are still @ May-31, we have to be fair :D
10:05	<moon456>	for those anxious to use dapper, you can always upgrade to (or install) the rc version and then when the official version is release do a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
10:05	<jsgotangco>	yo!
10:05	<lightstar>	jdub, 15 hours 54 minutes
10:05	<Seveas>	jsgotangco, yo homeboy 
10:05	<bliss_>	zjimbo: you could always go to bed and wake to a new day in say 18 hours
10:05	<joshhendo>	is that how much longer to go?
10:05	<philipacamaniac>	it is 8:05 am UK time
10:05	<Auckland_Pig>	its 8pm in auckland :D
10:05	<kakalto>	it's kinda sad to be in New Zealand..... we are highly likely to get the release on the 2nd... :'(
10:05	<ompaul>	933
10:05	<g-nome>	 = cool character
10:05	<zjimbo>	ahww why can't the world just work on "zjimbo time"

10:07	<bliss_>	whats this chatting clock!!!!!!!!
10:07	<neutrinomass>	eobanb: As well as my modems. But  one of my modems doesn't show.
10:07	<apikoros>	can gparted resize reiserfs partitions?
10:07	<La_PaRCa>	Just wanted to see how many hours to the world cup games
10:07	<lsuactiafner>	enough stop bot-poking pokings :)
10:08	<eobanb>	neutrinomass, well it's probably a winmodem.
10:08	<Xore>	@now caprica
10:08	<Xore>	?
10:08	<McNutella>	someone shouldnt have mentioned the time command then :)
10:08	<neutrinomass>	eobanb: It's not a winmodem, it's a USB adsl modem. It works fine, but it doesn't show there.
10:08	<mcquaid>	join #tapioca-voip
10:08	<guillem101>	Seveas, we need a channel for our impaciency
10:08	<eobanb>	neutrinomass, well, it's not perfect.
10:08	<scheuri>	McNutella: one should think that here are adults...:)
10:08	<Xore>	this is irc
10:08	<eobanb>	neutrinomass, wait, adsl?
10:08	<Xore>	nobody ever accused us of being adult
10:08	<philipacamaniac>	I'm hitting F5 on Ubuntu's website more than I ever did for a ThinkGeek fortune
10:08	<Healot>	PCI/USB modems are mostly winmodems/software modem, no real modem chipset, emulated and requires CPU power
10:08	<Fujitsu>	Haha
10:09	<neutrinomass>	eobanb: Yes, ATM.
10:09	<McNutella>	scheuri, just like christmas I guessl... tee hee *giggles* yey, wooo!
10:09	<scheuri>	Xore: sorry...how impolite of me...
10:09	<neutrinomass>	Healot: It's a DSL modem. It works fine !
10:09	<eobanb>	neutrinomass, when you say 'modem' we take that to mean '56k modem'
10:09	<scheuri>	McNutella: obvisouly
10:09	<Healot>	well... if you were talking about modem...
10:09	<g-nome>	will the torrent or the mirror be faster
10:09	<Auckland_Pig>	i did "update-manager -d" and am getting too many updates... how do i disable it?
10:09	<scheuri>	g-nome: depends when you download it
10:10	<OffHand>	torrent probably
10:10	<Healot>	that DSL modem is not really a modem, it;s like a bridge with NAT/DHCP/firewall feature in it
10:10	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, newsflash, computers are complicated
10:10	<neutrinomass>	Anyway. Does anybody know where network-admin looks for network interfaces ?
10:10	<Astinus->	what's the connection between CLOOP and SquashFS?
10:10	<Healot>	i don't recall what they call that DSL device
10:10	<scheuri>	g-nome: torrent might be much faster today and next few days
10:10	<g-nome>	can i downlaod it on mirror and seed it on torrent
10:10	<g-nome>	?
10:10	<neutrinomass>	Healot: Probably. I'm not exactly sure ...
10:10	<Auckland_Pig>	eobanb: please tell how do i disable it?
10:10	<scheuri>	g-nome: you are invited to do so
10:10	<Kr0ntab>	this is almost as exciting as waiting for the 1-2-3-4-5-6 phenomenon:  $ date "+%T %D"
10:10	<Kr0ntab>	01:02:03 04/05/06
10:10	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, don't run it?
10:10	<Kr0ntab>	:-P
10:10	<neutrinomass>	Healot: At least on the manufacturers website (and everywhere I've seen it) it's referred to as an "adsl modem"
10:11	<g-nome>	scheuri: well the problem is how to seed it on the dapper tracker?
10:11	<montbazin>	I'v 3 machines connected to a Cisco ethernet rooter, is there a command to se the IP adresses of the other machines ?
10:11	<Healot>	neutrinomass: they just want to make the term to be easy
10:11	<Kr0ntab>	I actually saved the output.  wutta lamer.
10:11	<Healot>	marketing purposes
10:11	<Auckland_Pig>	eobanb: there's this icon in the system tray asking me to update... can i just ignore it/
10:11	<scheuri>	g-nome: I have no idea...never done it myself...:)
10:11	<neutrinomass>	Healot: Probably. I guess it doesn't modulate anything at all. Anyway, thanks :)
10:11	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, if you want...i recommend you update, of course
10:11	<disinterested_pe>	well i upgraded and 6.06 is different
10:11	<OffHand>	montbazin, what if you do: ifconfig -a
10:11	<scheuri>	disinterested_pe: I hope it is
10:11	<McNutella>	good for you
10:11	<eobanb>	disinterested_pe, if it was the same, then why would you have upgraded
10:11	<dunnix>	beautiful beautiful   dapper
10:11	<Auckland_Pig>	eobanb: i only have limited bandwidth... and it downloads lots of packages daily
10:12	<Healot>	neutrinomass: it does modulates, but it doesn't require "dialing" >>	this what modems suppose to do
10:12	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, well get a CD from shipit then
10:12	<philipacamaniac>	Auckland_Pig:  it will do that until the final release
10:12	<scheuri>	Auckland_Pig: that will stop as of today...:)
10:12	<Auckland_Pig>	philipacamaniac: so i need not worry after today :)
10:12	<khermans>	Auto-Dapper-Torrentify on release: http://kristianhermansen.com/tmp/DapperTorrent
10:12	<Auckland_Pig>	scheuri: great
10:12	<philipacamaniac>	well, in less than 18 hours...
10:12	<Auckland_Pig>	:)
10:12	<neutrinomass>	Healot: Ahh, ok, thanks :) I'm not exactly sure how Adsl works, I have to read up on the subject .
10:12	<scheuri>	Auckland_Pig: I mean....you need to download ALL of them today and after today mostly only security updates occur
10:13	<JoseStefan>	what can i expect from the dapper-updates repository ?
10:13	<montbazin>	OffHand: ifconfig -a only shows the IPs on the machine I'm working at
=== Rewolution is now known as GdB1881
10:14	<khermans>	JoseStefan, updates
10:14	<OffHand>	montbazin: netstat -a
10:14	<khermans>	Joetheodd, btw--its here ->	http://kristianhermansen.com/tmp/DapperTorrent
10:14	<JoseStefan>	i mean, how big updates?
10:14	<highvoltage>	i think people are waiting for release to blog about it :)
10:14	<Seveas>	highvoltage, heh
10:14	<khermans>	JoseStefan, i mean it uses HEAD now
10:14	<La_PaRCa>	khermans, nice use of sed
10:14	<liquidindian>	Hello, I'm having a problem, and I don't know where to start trying to fix it.  I can't access the terminal, certain things in firefox don't work, synaptic and the update manager don't open...
10:14	<Fujitsu>	:O
10:14	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, you being facetious!!!
10:14	<Fujitsu>	A support request!
10:14	<Auckland_Pig>	i am pretty frustrated with Gaim release cycles... they should learn from ubuntu
10:14	<mcmahons>	liquidindian: are you running dapper
10:14	<Fujitsu>	What errors does it give, if any?
10:15	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, agreed
10:15	<liquidindian>	mcmahons, yep
10:15	<mcmahons>	Auckland_Pig: gaim needs serious work
10:15	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you sure it's gonna page you
10:15	<highvoltage>	!dapper
10:15	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
10:15	<khermans>	Joetheodd, lol why?
10:15	<Viaken>	liquidindian: I had that problem with the dapper beta a little earlier. It happened when I would resume from hibernate. Rebooting fixed it, and updating everything fixed it for good.
10:15	<khermans>	JoseStefan, yes it should
10:15	<disinterested_pe>	yeah it does mcmahons
10:15	<blue25h>	hi ya
10:15	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig and mcmahons, hopefully adium will do for gaim what ubuntu has done for debian
10:15	<mind>	hello, i need some help regarding screen resolution in ubuntu. Who can i privmsg ?
10:15	<highvoltage>	10:15 < highvoltage>	!dapper
10:15	<mcmahons>	liquidindian: try updating later today see if that fixes everything
10:15	<highvoltage>	10:15 < ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
10:15	<DarkTower>	adium?
10:15	<highvoltage>	oops, sorry
10:16	<eobanb>	mind, you can just ask here.
10:16	<Auckland_Pig>	gaim can still keep releasing while working on it..... dont understand why it needs to be kept in beta sooo long
10:16	<khermans>	JoseStefan, I bet you $100 i'm say "TOLD YOU SO" within one minutes of the release -- and I'll probably be asleep!
10:16	<Auckland_Pig>	just like google
10:16	<montbazin>	OffHand: netstat doesnt work either, it show everything on my machine, thas all
10:16	<liquidindian>	mcmahons, I can't open the terminal, though, or synaptic.  Is there any other way of doing that?
10:16	<JoseStefan>	khermans: no worries, i believe you
10:16	<blue25h>	both my printers worked ok in suse but refuse to work on ubuntu lol
10:17	<OffHand>	montbazin, I'm sorry. Maybe someone else knows
10:17	<Auckland_Pig>	!adium
10:17	<ubotu>	Auckland_Pig: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
10:17	<onkarshinde>	liquidindian: why can't you open terminal?
10:17	<khermans>	JoseStefan, im just messing around -- i should make the script post in here automatically with a notice though
10:17	<linav>	heard google got its own version of ubuntu with all google pkgs preinstalled
10:17	<Auckland_Pig>	!gaim
10:17	<Viaken>	liquidindian: ctrl-alt-F1 to switch to a virtual terminal, do what you need to, then restart gdm (/etc/init.d/gdm restart)
10:17	<ubotu>	it has been said that gaim is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/GaimHowto
10:17	<linav>	is it true
10:17	<philipacamaniac>	blue25h: what types of printers?

10:17	<mind>	ok, so i've just installed ubuntu, everything seems to be working fine, except screen resolution. I can't set it higher than 1024 x 768, 60 hz. I qouldn't mind the low resolution per-say, but the 60 hz refresh rate is killing my eyes :>. My monitor can do 1600 x 1200 @ 85 hz, it's an LG f900B (19') flatron. Thanks

10:18	<La_PaRCa>	Seveas, Um, no. I will have a pony if I want a damn pony.
10:18	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, it's actually very hacky -- there must be a better way
10:18	<Seveas>	La_PaRCa, NO YOU CAN'T HAV A PONY!
10:18	<matt_>	Hi all, I am having problems with .rar files.  I have a rar file that i created on a windows machine which i want to extract on ubuntu.  I think i will need the nonfree version of unrar as the archive is probably version 3.  i have tried adding the multiverse source and running an apt-get update.  I have then tried apt-get install unrar-nonfree but i keep getting an error
10:18	<Auckland_Pig>	shriphani: cant you do that on the login screen menu?
10:18	<ompaul>	dizz1, no less than
10:18	<kevor>	Wow, what happened to rhythmbox!!! it's actually perfect now :)
10:18	<eobanb>	shriphani, in gdm you can select text mode
10:18	<JoseStefan>	shriphani: search the wiki
10:18	<khermans>	matt_, aptitude install rar unrar

10:19	<OffHand>	my little pony
10:19	<La_PaRCa>	Seveas, Well, if I cant have a pony, can I at least have some dapper final ISOs?
10:19	<blue25h>	every thing else works fine but the prnters sighs
10:19	<neutrinomass>	matt_: The package name is 'unrar' IIRC
10:19	<shriphani>	i mean if i want to boot into console once and once in gnome how ?
10:19	<Seveas>	La_PaRCa, in a few hours 
10:19	<onkarshinde>	I believe todays daily build ISO is not going to be changed anyway. So it is final. Am I wrong?
10:19	<xukun>	can I change the owner of my usb stick?
10:19	<philipacamaniac>	blue25h: notice HP desktjet 5550 uses the hpijs driver and is known to work

10:19	<philipacamaniac>	blue25h: sighs?
10:19	<JoseStefan>	shriphani: you can switch from console to x, with ctrl+alt+f1 and ctrl+alt+f7 respectivly
10:19	<neutrinomass>	(sorry, hit enter accidentally )
10:19	<matt_>	E: Package unrar has no installation candidate
10:20	<kevor>	khermans matt_ : also aptitude install unrar-nonfree
10:20	<eobanb>	Xore, i'd just try both and see what you like
10:20	<scheuri>	Xore: aptitude has a better "memory" of what has been installed and can uninstall unneeded and abandonned libs easier
10:20	<blue25h>	okies is looking ty
10:20	<Fujitsu>	Xore, aptitude is newer, and generally preferred.
10:20	<matt_>	what does aptitude do compared to apt-get?
10:20	<matt_>	oh okay
10:20	<shriphani>	hmm i mean cant it be done at boot time
10:20	<neutrinomass>	matt_ Are you sure you enabled multiverse/universe correctly ?
10:20	<apikoros>	does either the ubuntu livecd or install cd have reiserfs tools?
10:20	<zjimbo>	ne one tried Smart pkg man
10:20	<Auckland_Pig>	what version of gaim does dapper have?
10:21	<matt_>	well i think i did all line with multiverse at the end i uncommented in the sources.list
10:21	<Fujitsu>	zjimbo, syntax error.
10:21	<Auckland_Pig>	1.5 or 2.0.0b3

10:21	<onkarshinde>	Auckland_Pig: 1.5.0

10:23	<scheuri>	Seveas: ah okay...a special repository I presume
10:23	<mcmahons>	onkarshinde: what has changed in the beta

10:24	<Polibio>	hallo
10:24	<eobanb>	welcome, Polibio
10:24	<onkarshinde>	mcmahons: Lot of things. Accounts management, plugin management, preferences
10:24	<matt_>	scheuri: i have run the search and it foudn the unrar-nonfree now what i tried aptitude install unrar-nonfree and it says no candidate version found
10:24	<RancidLM>	will ubuntu have a yast console type utility?
10:24	<mcmahons>	onkarshinde: do you like it?
10:24	<Fujitsu>	zjimbo, apt-get is significantly better than anything RPM-based anyway!
10:24	<eobanb>	'yast console type utility'??
10:24	<La_PaRCa>	ompaul, if they say dapper will "release june 1st" I can say this brush is a pony.

10:25	<Viaken>	RancidLM: Like apt?
10:25	<scheuri>	matt_: after doing the search...what letter is in front of unrar-nofree?

10:25	<blue25h>	when the next vertion of ubunto comes live will it up date or do you need to down load the cd ?
10:25	<Polibio>	has any of you the message: "10 CDs approved and sent to the shipping company in 2006-05-24" in the shipit pages?
10:25	<reon>	Fujitsu, What about it ?
10:25	<flowolf>	dapper installer crashes on my pc
10:25	<RancidLM>	Viaken: na, u see yast basicly was a console based text gui control panel
10:25	<flowolf>	that's odd
10:25	<scheuri>	matt_: that means it is a virtual package, not really existing...this used if you may install severel packages which belong togehter in once or if the package actually does not exist...
10:25	<ompaul>	@now nz
10:25	<Viaken>	Ah ok

10:26	<mcmahons>	La_PaRCa: well theres still 5 1/2 hours to go. jeff said itll be there before bed.
10:26	<Fujitsu>	reon, Dapper has /not/ been released yet.
10:26	<Seveas>	Polibio, the *order* was sent to the shipping company
10:26	<scheuri>	matt_: sorry, cant spell anymore...
10:26	<shriphani>	people how do i make ubuntu give me a choice of booting in console or in gnome at startup
10:26	<Mithrandir>	[Yatta] : no, /etc/environment
10:26	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, it is ambiguous.
10:26	<flowolf>	can it be a problem with xfs as / partition?
10:26	<Seveas>	Fujitsu, indeed
10:26	<onkarshinde>	mcmahons: Voice And Video. There was a seperate fork of Gaim that had implemented it. Plans are to integrate in Gaim. I thought it would be Gaim2. Also I expected at least GTalk VoIP in Gaim2
10:26	<[Yatta] >	ohhhhhh thanks.. that explain why my stuff wasn't working
10:26	<Fujitsu>	`# CDs approved and sent to shipping company' implies the CDs have been sent.
10:26	<matt_>	scheuri: so there is no way to extract my rar file on my ubuntu box?
10:26	<reon>	Fujitsu, Well it seems to be on the servers regardless what the topic says. Unless I've got the cat by the tail.
10:26	<Auckland_Pig>	shriphani: you should be able to do that from the GDM login screen
10:26	<eobanb>	reon, if you read the topic, you would see that dapper is not out yet.  and since it's not out yet, ISOs are not yet available.  understand?
10:26	<Seveas>	flowolf, xfs as / is always probelematic if you don't have a separate /boot
10:26	<Polibio>	Seveas, "10 CDs approved and sent to the shipping company in 2006-05-24"  the CDs, not the order", have you a similar phrase?
10:27	<shriphani>	ok so i type startx ?
10:27	<Viaken>	shriphani: Would involve changing the default runlevel by editing your /etc/grub.conf (or would it be /boot/grub.conf?). I don't know beyond that.
10:27	<Auckland_Pig>	shriphani: you can try "alt + F1"
10:27	<mcmahons>	onkarshinde: ok, doess that stuff work in ekiga?
10:27	<highvoltage>	shriphani: you cna edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst file
10:27	<shriphani>	ok
10:27	<scheuri>	matt_: I actually wonder why this package is not available...gimme a sec...I will check
10:27	<La_PaRCa>	Whats the name of the package on dapper to install the whole LAMP stack?
10:27	<highvoltage>	shriphani: and make it boot to a runlevel that doesn't start gdm
10:27	<mind>	 in the tutorial it says that "If you are running Hoary Hedgehog or Breezy Badger, then install nvidia-settings. DO NOT install nvidia-settings in Dapper Drake because it will remove nvidia-glx". how i know what i'm running ? :)
10:27	<onkarshinde>	mcmahons: Haven't tried Ekiga. I am still on Breezy
10:27	<reon>	eobanb, I CAN read. All I said is that the iso's are available, you don't have to believe me.
10:27	<mcmahons>	onkarshinde: oh ok cool :)

10:31	<Auckland_Pig>	khermans: i'm just a bit anxious that something might happen to my hard disk. because i've kept mine on for nearly 2 months... with just 3 reboots.....
10:31	<Fujitsu>	It may not change.

10:33	<La_PaRCa>	rpaul, well, your average pc without a monitor can use up about 200w
10:33	<La_PaRCa>	rpaul, 300w depending on the load
10:33	<dooglus>	Auckland_Pig: I would think that using a hard disk is more likely to wear it out than not using it.
10:33	<onkarshinde>	I want to print Ubuntu logo on coffee mug. Does any one know if there is any legal problem?
10:34	<ThE-LiGhT>	ompaul, 10q too
10:34	<dooglus>	Auckland_Pig: for maximum lifetime, never use it, ever.
10:34	<rpaul>	200w an hour ... 300*24*7/1000 = 50.4 KW per week
10:34	<JoseStefan>	i think the mug must be GNU
10:34	<scheuri>	matt_: well,...try it first with free-version...it works with free and nonfree here with my breezy...seems you have not all repositories open (have you made a aptitude update lately?)
10:34	<scheuri>	wow
10:34	<scheuri>	its calm.-....toooo calm
10:34	<rpaul>	opps, that is for 300 kW
10:34	<onkarshinde>	JoseStefan: What does that mean?
10:34	<Auckland_Pig>	dooglus: i've got 2 harddisks.... and the 2nd one is mounted... but used like 1hour a day..... so was worrying if it might wear out sooner
10:34	<dooglus>	rpaul: "w an hour"?  watt's that mean?

10:35	<zjimbo>	is there a viable alternative to mains energy?
10:35	<Fracture>	onkarshinde: I think he means that if you want to distribute your mug, after printing ubuntu on it, you need to make it GPL
10:35	<philipacamaniac>	hey, we're getting closer to that 1000 user mark
10:35	<rpaul>	my total energy for the entire house is about 110kW per week

10:36	<Fracture>	onkarshinde: I bought one from Cafe press
10:36	<dooglus>	rpaul: you can't measure energy use in kW per week - that's a rate of acceleration of energy use
10:36	<MonsieurBon>	philipacamaniac, yeah cool, a pony!!!
10:36	<matt_>	scheuri: i must have the sources setup wrong i guess
10:36	<McNutella>	my box has been on for over two years, ive yet to run into emergancy power because of it
10:36	<rpaul>	150kWh per week then
10:36	<g-nome>	does anyone know: which os has MORE USERS: linux or mac ? (with and without server?)
10:36	<RancidLM>	kinda off topic.. any one know how to disable auto read on thunderbird?
10:36	<rpaul>	dooglus: is that right now?
10:36	<McNutella>	g-nome, ill bet google knows that one ;)
10:36	<philipacamaniac>	g-nome: with server most certainly Linux

10:37	<[Yatta] >	Mithrandir,  Thanks for the help :D it worked.. i could use the profile but then i would have to use export

10:37	<dooglus>	rpaul: I don't know if it's right, but at least the units mean something now.  (I'm 6 feet per second tall, by the way)
10:37	<JanJoost>	silly question: is there anyone who's managed to get xv installed on breezy?
10:37	<rpaul>	dooglus: you are growing fast
10:37	<YukiCuss>	Fujitsu, yup.
10:37	<JanJoost>	(xv as in the image viewer)
10:37	<zjimbo>	961 now
10:37	<dooglus>	rpaul: so are your electricity bills
10:37	<Fracture>	onkarshinde: the idea of the trademark policy is to protect the ubuntu and canonical image.  so if you are should be fine
10:37	<McNutella>	lol
10:37	<La_PaRCa>	dooglus, w per hour means using a watt for an hour

10:38	<Fracture>	!pony
10:38	<ubotu>	Fracture: I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
10:38	<dooglus>	La_PaRCa: no, it doesn't.  "1 watt hour" is using a watt for an hour.  watt per hour doesn't mean much.
10:38	<Auckland_Pig>	:p
10:38	<rpaul>	La_PaRCa: i write just 150Kw per week before, so he is write
10:38	<pseudodeadkitty>	Everyone should get a pony for this.
10:38	<g-nome>	McNutella: tried google, but did not found anything
10:38	<philipacamaniac>	Auckland_Pig: no, see topic. heh.
10:38	<La_PaRCa>	dooglus, you are strictly right
10:38	<_nano_>	onkarshinde: i think printing ubuntu logo on a personal coffee mug comes within "fair use"
10:38	<rpaul>	La_PaRCa: wow that was a bad sentence by me :P
10:38	<McNutella>	g-nome, guess you will just have to guess.. my gueses are both would be linux
10:39	<Seveas>	JanJoost, I *think* I had it installed on Breey
10:39	<matt_>	scheuri: if you are on breezy would you be able to paste your sources.list in a message window and i can compare please
10:39	<JanJoost>	seveas: ooh!
10:39	<Burgundavia>	_nano_: provided your country has a concept of fair use
10:39	<scheuri>	matt_: aye...
10:39	<g-nome>	you think linux has MORE dekstop users than mac?
10:39	<disinterested_pe>	ubuntu says my ferrari is in the mail
10:39	<McNutella>	onkarshinde, besides, for personal use im sure you could get away without even having to bother abotu asking or worrying

10:39	<Xore>	matt_: how about you use pastebin?
10:39	<JanJoost>	seveas: I managed to find a debian package, but that won't install since it has a dependency on xlib6g (which is not to be found)
10:39	<g-nome>	if so that would be great and force all the industry to finally create software for linux too

10:43	<McNutella>	Auckland_Pig, 6k
10:43	<dhonn>	rpaul, is your system intel or amd, intel total system power uses at least 2x of amd

10:43	<shriphani>	oh

10:48	<ompaul>	ESPOiG, that would spoil the fun

10:48	<guillem101>	Hmm, 6.06 is at ubuntuforums marked as release. Is it save to upgrade right now or is it advisable to wait until "official release"?
10:48	<La_PaRCa>	Seveas, you are my new hero. You deserve a medal or something, you ver very very patient man.
10:48	<dhonn>	rpaul, in sandiego/ca our energy cost is about 13 cents per kW.  My bill is $39
10:48	<ubuntubes>	after install mysql, then how to access it??
10:48	<H080J03>	hmm so how do you get an h264 movie to play?
10:49	<BadriNarayan>	ubuntubes: Did you install *mysql-server* ?
10:49	<ompaul>	zjimbo, you don't need that you could have used sudo but it would be better not to do it at all ;-)
10:49	<ubuntubes>	BadriNarayan yes I did
10:49	<philipacamaniac>	guillem101: You can upgrade. the "official" release is for the iso's and torrents.
10:49	<ubuntubes>	BadriNarayan but how to access it
10:49	<Auckland_Pig>	just 34 more users for 1000 :)
10:49	<eobanb>	dhonn, i think you mean kWh
10:49	<BadriNarayan>	ubuntubes: try mysql -u root -p
10:49	<dhonn>	eobanb, yea
10:49	<kevor>	Wow, cewl that Java is now available via aptitude :)
10:49	<Auckland_Pig>	ubotu get some of your bot friends in here

10:50	<apokryphos>	Auckland_Pig: he's already with Ubugtu and ubuntulog
10:50	<guillem101>	philipacamaniac, so... via synaptic (changing everything from breezy to dapper) I will get the actual "official" release?
10:50	<Seveas>	and EdgyEft
10:50	<Edward_TLS>	ubuntubes, username and password
10:50	<BadriNarayan>	ubuntubes -u for username
10:50	<zjimbo>	Im using Suse 10.1 so no sudo!... I think. = |
10:50	<BadriNarayan>	ubuntube: -p for prompting for password, see man page
10:51	<Auckland_Pig>	what is Ubugtu ?
10:51	<ubuntubes>	BadriNarayan Edward_TLS so do I have to type: mysql userxxx root passxxx

10:51	<BadriNarayan>	ubuntubes: what happens when you just say "mysql"?
10:52	<rpaul>	dhonn: I pay NZD $0.21 per kWh .... not sure how that compares.
10:52	<Xore>	there needs to be a ubuntunes player
10:52	<Xore>	to compete with itunes, or something

10:55	<ivoks>	Celestar: will be today
10:55	<H080J03>	fillado it is h264
10:55	<Celestar>	ivoks: so I'll wait till then, :)

10:55	<Big_T>	 i'm waiting for dapper since midnight.. :D
10:56	<matt_>	scheuri: I got your message and it worked, do you know a way to recover a file that i have just deleted?

10:56	<khermans>	matt_, immediatle shut down your pc

10:56	<flowolf>	apokryphos: I'm a gentoo user so I know how to fix the resolution
10:56	<OmniD>	22? 21.
=== waltman_ is now known as CactusWiZaRd
10:56	<Seveas>	H080J03, automatix is a virus
10:56	<H080J03>	and it still won't play
10:56	<OmniD>	20.
10:56	<VirtualDarKness>	if we get 2000 users can we have a pony?
10:56	<flowolf>	but that's bad as I was going to give ubuntu to some friends
10:56	<Fillado>	yeah VLC can play a 1080p .mov
10:56	<apokryphos>	flowolf: but gentoo users wouldn't know there's a dpkg-reconfigure for it :)
10:56	<Seveas>	VirtualDarKness, 1500
10:56	<scheuri>	matt_: I am afraid that is not possible...linux does not know that kind of recovery...KDE/Gnome has a bin...but console is mercyless
10:56	<Fillado>	in Windows at least
10:56	<Celestar>	ivoks: is it recommended to be used on a production system?
10:56	<VirtualDarKness>	Seveas, ;)
10:57	<OffHand>	automatix is a virus  =  LMAO
10:57	<khermans>	matt_, and then hex dump your drive contents if it is that important
10:57	<morgs>	VirtualDarKness: Ponies will be provided at a later date through dapper-updates
10:57	<ivoks>	Celestar: it's based on debian and has commercial support, even sun likes it... i don't see how much better support you can get :)
10:57	<khermans>	Seveas, Automatix users should try EasyUbuntu instead
10:57	<JoseStefan>	he just haves to set +l to 1499 :(
10:57	<Fillado>	you get that H080J03?
10:57	<Seveas>	morgs, dapper-ponies
10:57	<ompaul>	alsa, there are two ways to do that sftp which works like ftp and scp which is secure copy http://www.openssh.com/faq.html is fairly useful
10:57	<H080J03>	yea but the file i have is a Advanced Video Coding (H264)
10:57	<Celestar>	ivoks: good, because I still can't set up any friendship with solaris 10
10:57	<Fillado>	yeah so's this one
10:57	<K|NgGh0sT>	le sigh
10:57	<Ed_L>	I would so love to see a netsplit in this channel
10:57	<K|NgGh0sT>	this channel used to be used for support
10:57	<Fillado>	like i said it's a 1080p .mov
10:57	<matt_>	khermans:  sounds longwinded, guess i will have to get the backups out, arse
10:57	<OmniD>	Maybe they are waiting for there to be 1000 people in here guys
10:57	<ompaul>	khermans, there is no try there is only do
10:58	<Burgundavia>	K|NgGh0sT: it will be tomorrow again

=== Prx is now known as Kurtz
11:14	<rixxon>	i wonder is this the biggest channel on freenode, currently?
11:14	<cute_bettong>	it woulden't let me send to the channel
11:14	<tiagoboldt>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
11:14	<ProfFrink>	Seveas: Thanks for bringing a moment of sanity to the channel :D
11:14	<tarzeau>	rixxon: try /list -yes
11:14	<Auckland_Pig>	woo hooo.....
11:14	<apokryphos>	mikey: because ubuntu does long-term releases
11:14	<rob>	rixxon, I think so
11:14	<cute_bettong>	something in here glitched
11:14	<tiagoboldt>	it doens't says nothing about RC
11:14	<frenkel>	Seveas: soon as in minutes, or soon as in hours?
11:14	<tiagoboldt>	isn't it really the final?
11:14	<cute_bettong>	i think it's becasue ubuntu pwns XD

11:15	<mikey>	apokryphos, on my shipped it cd, it says there is a new release every 6 months with updates and support for a year
11:15	<VirtualDarKness>	soon means as fast as a pony is ;)

11:15	<philipacamaniac>	the question is, who will update the Wikipedia article first? And who will get the approved submission to Slashdot?
11:15	<fermi>	why I am banned to talk?
11:15	<Lukketto>	mikey: the dapper is a LTS

11:22	<Linuturk>	ummmm, no seeds on the torrent
11:22	<Linuturk>	o bother
11:22	<PPower>	still not here at the server
11:22	<PPower>	still got dalies
11:22	<ubuntubes>	Lynoure : then how to completely remove ?
11:22	<ompaul>	Linuturk, they have to hit the servers first
11:22	<mdz>	Spaceraver: about the same, but with about a month's fewer bug fixes ;-)
11:22	<Astinus->	was the forum dapper announcement the same isos as the final?
11:22	<ThE-LiGhT>	!dapper
11:22	<ubotu>	dapper is released and called 6.06
11:22	<Balachmar>	I have a question about the alacarte menu editor. The programming menu doesn't show up (and in the ditor it is in Italic) How do I make it show up?
11:22	<tgb>	is there a problem with the BT tracker? I keep getting rejected...
11:22	<tiagoboldt>	i've told u that that was the final version..
11:22	<frenkel>	Linuturk: i'm willing to seed, but my client can't connect tot he tracker
11:22	<khermans>	There is no MD5SUM for the Sparch build !!?!?!
11:22	<guzu>	ok, what's the different contetn of server cd and desktop cd?
11:22	<philipacamaniac>	http://digg.com/linux_unix/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_Officially_Released
11:22	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: That command _does_ completely remove.
11:22	<guzu>	on 606
11:22	<Spaceraver>	so that means i dont do a dist upgrade then... just upgrade as normal...
11:22	<ThE-LiGhT>	YEAHHHH BABY YEAHHH
11:22	<khermans>	oh no SPARC build at all
11:22	<Seveas>	khermans, sparc build will be released later
11:22	<akaihola>	rgp: yes, torrent says connection refused
11:23	<Linuturk>	heh, and the internet crashes

11:24	<derfbugzi>	omgz its still not here noes
11:24	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: But not in a way that could could pass your harddisk to feds and be sure that they cannot dig stuff out, that kind of complete removing is more work intensive/takes tools
11:24	<Flannel>	chrisbudden14: no, now server is tuned for server installs.
11:24	<CN_EricNeon>	Seveas: then if Dapper will release when we hit 1100 ?
11:24	<chrisbudden14>	oh i see thanks Flannel
11:24	<Aegir_>	=] :D\-<
11:24	<khermans>	Tracker must be swamped or something
11:24	<mind>	hello, sorry for the huge copy paste earlier Seveas, it won't happen again
11:24	<Astinus->	hmmm, what exactly is the root password for server?
11:24	<rob>	CN_EricNeon, sure!
11:24	<MonsieurBon>	are there any mirrors where I can get Dapper a bit faster then with 30kb/s?
11:24	<ompaul>	CN_EricNeon, its out
11:24	<Flannel>	so, we've gotta have a torrent for the .torrent file, right?
11:24	<pseudodeadkitty>	Tracker is probably freaking at the # of connections it just got hit with.
11:24	<PPower>	NOOO! Apt crashed!
11:24	<OmniD>	ouch 2 hour download

11:24	<ompaul>	Godfather-Off, reat the topic
11:25	<cfraz89>	wow this is crazy hahaha
11:25	<La_PaRCa>	haha
11:25	<Lynoure>	Why is it this minute urgent to get dapper? =)
11:25	<ompaul>	Godfather-Off, :-)
11:25	<cfraz89>	its so peaceful at #kubuntu
11:25	<Celestar>	ok where is that download?
11:25	<neoXite>	is the repo now final?
11:25	<ompaul>	hehe
11:25	<La_PaRCa>	not seeing any seeds yet. I guess its nice to be on the seeder team!
11:25	<chrisbudden14>	im getting ~300kb/s from http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
11:25	<tiagoboldt>	http://fridge.ubuntu.com/ <- official anounce :)
11:25	<JoseStefan>	can i post ed2k links here?
11:25	<maswan>	chrisbudden14: I got 10.40 MB/s from se.releases.ubuntu.com
11:25	<kane77>	how long does it take to upgrade to dapper??
11:25	<mind>	so i've followed the instructions i've received from the link about installing the nvidia drivers, everything went ok, i logged off and rebooted the PC (just to make sure).
11:25	<Krpano>	i already finished... :D
11:25	<ubuntubes>	Lynoure : so when ever I deleted files it still there? then it can junk my harddisk right ?
11:25	<PPower>	reboot time! try and unlock apt
11:25	<apokryphos>	tiagoboldt: technically the official announce is the one one news ubuntu page or the mailing list
11:26	<neoXite>	weeee!! release?
11:26	<Linuturk>	for those that finished the downloads, can you seed the iso?
11:26	<Balachmar>	How can I help spreading the iso's?
11:26	<Celestar>	damnit
11:26	<frenkel>	Linuturk: the tracker doesn't work
11:26	<Celestar>	there's no Sparc Release yet?
11:26	<Fillado>	get onto the torrent with azureus
11:26	<Linuturk>	use azureus
11:26	<JoseStefan>	i'm starting the ed2k seeds
11:26	<Fillado>	DHT will do the rest
11:26	<frenkel>	no, azureus sucks
11:26	<pschulz01>	Are there any torrents?
11:26	<apokryphos>	Balachmar: by leaving your torrent client on after the download
11:26	<mikey>	Balachmar, put the iso anywhere you can :P
11:26	<philipacamaniac>	Looks like http://www.ubuntu.com/download still needs updating
11:26	<mind>	just before the login screen the nvidia logo splash screen appeared, and everything went a-ok. but now, i cannot find the nvidia settings and i still can't modify the refresh rates. can anyone help ? thanks
11:26	<frenkel>	i already have downloaded it, but i'm going to seed the torrent
11:26	<apokryphos>	pschulz01: yes, check the announcements
11:26	<kane77>	Balachmar, try seeding it through bittorrent
11:27	<mikey>	Balachmar, give it to your neighbors so they can help seed
11:27	<khermans>	"Requested download is not authorized for use with this tracker" ???
11:27	<CactusWiZaRd>	can i upgrade ubuntu through apt-get?
11:27	<apokryphos>	CactusWiZaRd: yes
11:27	<LivingTarget>	yes
11:27	<tgb>	khermans: I get the same error. no idea why.
11:27	<La_PaRCa>	We need some seeders to get in the torrent
11:27	<chrisbudden14>	im getting that as well khermans
11:27	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: Yes and no. Can you start over and tell me what is it that you want to achieve: free disk space, make files 'disappear' or make damn sure no one can ever never get to those files?
11:27	<Linuturk>	start mass producing cd's and overnight them to everyone
11:27	<kane77>	apokryphos, how long does the upgrade take??
11:27	<chrisbudden14>	lol Linuturk
11:27	<Auckland_Pig>	what is LTS?
11:27	<CactusWiZaRd>	apokryphos: with what upload?
11:27	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, I have a gigabit network -- but torrents not working
11:27	<Fillado>	long term support
11:27	<CactusWiZaRd>	i mean command
11:27	<kane77>	Auckland_Pig long time support
11:27	<Krpano>	ill log into my windows and start helping seed...brb
11:27	<orbin>	mind: refresh rates ususally depend on the monitor freq. values in your xorg config
11:28	<derfbugzi>	any one got a link to the dvd?
11:28	<Auckland_Pig>	oh ok
11:28	<cef>	khermans: what client?
11:28	<derfbugzi>	torrent file
11:28	<La_PaRCa>	khermans, you probably have the wrong file
11:28	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, I'm sitting on gigabit upload
11:28	<apokryphos>	kane77: well, bandwidth might not be at its fastest now, but normally it just depends on your connection
11:28	<Tomek>	is there a dvd-iso-torrent yet?
11:28	<apokryphos>	not too long
11:28	<mind>	who can i msg for help regarding nvidia driver install ? thanks
11:28	<calyth>	I've got the torrent from the us server, but somehow there aren't any seeds there....
11:28	<La_PaRCa>	khermans, check the md5
11:28	<khermans>	cef, blaunchmanycurses
11:28	<ubuntubes>	Lynoure : I just want to free disk space
11:28	<apokryphos>	Tomek:there should be, yes.
11:28	<tgb>	cef: I'm using btdownloadcurses and get that
11:28	<kane77>	apokryphos, but how much data is it?
11:28	<dooglus>	if you use azureus to connect to the torrent, you can start downloading using dht
11:28	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, I downloaded the torrents here http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
11:28	<apokryphos>	kane77: depends on how many things you have installed
11:28	<La_PaRCa>	khermans, check the md6 there with the one from the iso you downloaded
11:28	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: then careful use of rm -r <directory>	will do that for you

11:29	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, do you have the correct torrent files?
11:29	<mikey>	or has it already been pre-done
11:29	<ubuntubes>	Lynoure : ooo ok thanks btw how to check for my disk space left?
11:29	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: But be sure you don't target it to a wrong directory as recovering from accidental delete can be hard (no trash bin for the command line)
11:29	<mikey>	ready for the release

11:31	<z4k4ri4>	!DVD
11:31	<ubotu>	DVD playing is possible in ubuntu. You may need libdvdcss2, which is available via http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages (section extras)
11:31	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, oh not us.
11:31	<changlinn>	I'll be seeding it at full speed as soon as I get home

11:32	<ompaul>	I was asked to they are playing havoc with some terminals
11:32	<Seveas>	ompaul, why? Ubuntu is unicode by default 
11:32	<La_PaRCa>	Balachmar, download the .torrent of whatever iso you have from here http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/6.06/ and when your client asks where to save, point it to the iso you have
11:32	<apokryphos>	z4k4ri4: mirrors haven't synced yet, looks like it.
11:32	<PPower>	mind: dont try it. i broke ubuntu.
11:32	<neoxan>	thx Seveas and sorry!
11:32	<amac-laptop>	You guys are fast: http://digg.com/linux_unix/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_Officially_Released
11:32	<LordElph>	server iso seems to have no seeds, can I do a server install from the desktop iso just as easily?
11:32	<ompaul>	Seveas, some people are not as lucky as us :)
11:32	<Celestar>	I can't download :P
11:32	<Seveas>	even my irssi-in-screen-on-gentoo works fine 
11:32	<ompaul>	shhh dont say g
11:32	<chrisbudden14>	torent still not working for me
11:33	<jcz`>	can anyone tell me why #ubuntu-1 is now invite-only ??
11:33	<panosl>	Hmmmm, it seems that the torrent: ubuntu-dapper-desktop-i386.iso.torrent is not downloading. I grabbed dapper-desktop-i386.iso.torrent from the tracker page, and now its downloading fine.
11:33	<pseudodeadkitty>	Know what's funny about all the hype related to it? My wife became curious as to what all the hype was about, and why I was so excited. I think we have another linux user in the house (finally)
11:33	<kbrooks>	Seveas: ping
11:33	<dooglus>	chrisbudden14: use azureus, it'll work then
11:33	<Linuturk>	LordElph, give the seeds a little bit
11:33	<Flannel>	Seveas: yeah, irssi - screen - putty works, but have to have all three set to unicode.
11:33	<kbrooks>	Seveas: pm me
11:33	<mind>	ppower : priv pls. thanks
11:33	<Linuturk>	Alternate just started up for me :)

11:33	<dooglus>	chrisbudden14: anything compatible with az's dht will work - bitcomet for instance or utorrent
11:33	<jcz`>	#ubuntu+1 unable to join channel (invite only)

11:34	<z4k4ri4>	Yes, but it thesame as yesterdays daily
11:34	<leleobhz>	YEAH!
11:34	<dhonn>	the funny thing is that when people start installing dapper they will have to logoff the channel
11:34	<mikey>	now everyone... go get a drink!
11:34	<CactusWiZaRd>	darn
11:35	<CactusWiZaRd>	:E

11:35	<chrisbudden14_>	im just getting rejected by tracker on bittornado
11:35	<rixxon>	apokryphos: ah ok thanks
11:35	<tgb>	khermans: which tracker URL did you use that worked?
11:35	<lmanul>	jcz`: Use options on the greet screen
11:35	<agwibowo>	huh?
11:35	<dooglus>	chrisbudden14_: bittornado doesn't do DHT do it?
11:35	<Godfather-Off>	wich kernel has dapper drake?
11:35	<agwibowo>	Dapper is released?
11:35	<alanhs>	Mithrandir, when you said "noapi apci=off...."  How do I specify that during a boot ? F6 ?
11:35	<mikey>	hip hip HOORAY!
11:35	<rixxon>	apokryphos: will i have to reboot / things like that?
11:35	<pseudodeadkitty>	khermans: 1025 Guiness....now that's a tab. :)
11:35	<chrisbudden14_>	whats DHT dooglus
11:35	<Sonderblade>	why does ubuntu use utf-8 default instead of iso-8859?
11:35	<mikey>	YES!
11:35	<khermans>	tgb, well im having same problem still on some torrent files -- but some from us.releases... are working okay
11:35	<philipacamaniac>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
11:35	<asdx_>	whats so cool about dapper?
11:36	<leleobhz>	YEP!
11:36	<dooglus>	Godfather-Off: 2.6.15-23-686
11:36	<Fillado>	DHT means you can do torrents without a tracker
11:36	<tgb>	khermans: ok, I'll try that one, thanks.
11:36	<apokryphos>	rixxon: it's probably a good idea, yes.
11:36	<khermans>	pseudodeadkitty, i bought 5 Irish Car Bombs last night...heh
11:36	<Mithrandir>	alanhs: yes.
11:36	<lmanul>	alanhs: If you're using grub, type "e" to edit one of the menu entries
11:36	<Kr0ntab>	asdx_, it starts with a d!
11:36	<apokryphos>	ubotu: no rc is <reply>	To Upgrade from RC to final, just: sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
11:36	<ubotu>	okay, apokryphos
11:36	<chrisbudden14_>	thanks Fillado
11:36	<Godfather-Off>	dooglus, in the web says 2.6.15.6
11:36	<Mithrandir>	alanhs: just append it to the end of the line.
11:36	<agwibowo>	just about time!
11:36	<rixxon>	apokryphos: will i loose any data on the disk?! :P
11:36	<agwibowo>	i'm sick of this opensuse
11:36	<bliss_>	Dapper Drake has been released http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185721
11:36	<apokryphos>	rixxon: nope

11:36	<rixxon>	apokryphos: cool thank you
11:36	<Seveas>	bliss_, we need no forum crap to know it has been released...
11:36	<CactusWiZaRd>	apokryphos: for me this doesn't update anything :E
11:36	<leleobhz>	asdx_: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html

11:37	<philipacamaniac>	Chousuke: It's released!

11:37	<CactusWiZaRd>	apokryphos, Breezy Badger

11:37	<Seveas>	Celestar, might take a few days
11:37	<Godfather-Off>	dooglus, me too, but in the official release says 2.6.15.6
11:37	<apokryphos>	CactusWiZaRd: then check the /topic

11:38	<agwibowo>	bbrazil: more minimal install???
11:38	<thoreauputic>	mdz: :)
11:38	<bliss_>	RELESE ISSUED BY  Matt Zimmerman
11:38	<bbrazil>	agwibowo: installs as little as possible, doesn't install X etc.
11:38	<apokryphos>	mdz: indeed :). Largest channel by quite a bit.
11:38	<agwibowo>	bbrazil: ah.. ok .. thx
11:38	<agwibowo>	no dvd version?
11:38	<Laterix>	So is there this normal install CD available or is it just Desktop install nowadays?
11:38	<sduffy>	When is Dapper Drake going to be released?
11:38	<bbrazil>	agwibowo: waiting on it myself, should be
11:38	<thoreauputic>	hi ompaul :)
11:38	<lsuactiafner>	damnit i just finished my breezy download on a dialup..
11:38	<freddo>	\o/
11:38	<apokryphos>	agwibowo: not yet; looks like the mirrors still need to sync.
11:38	<Lukketto>	aduffy: it's out!
11:38	<thoreauputic>	Seveas: meanie ;-)
11:38	<Balachmar>	I get Requested download is not authorized with this tracker...
11:38	<Linuturk>	lol lsuactiafner
11:38	<Soir>	sduffy: a few minutes ago.
11:39	<khermans>	Seems like only the ALTERNATE torrents are working for me
11:39	<orbin>	lsuactiafner: ouch
11:39	<Balachmar>	How do I fix that?
11:39	<Ng>	is the dapper server kernel just recommended for big iron machines or regular PC hardware running as a server too?
11:39	<bbrazil>	Ng: 8+ cpu
11:39	<Chousuke>	I'd torrent Dapper, but I have a 7GB upload limit :/
11:39	<Fillado>	dammit i'm just going to get the file with Opera and then move it onto the torrent when it's working
11:39	<sduffy>	Soir: hmm i must check our mirror or force an update of it
11:39	<lsuactiafner>	heh not really... but takes 2 weeks to get it
11:39	<bliss_>	Seveas: sorry i though it was official as  Matt Zimmerman works for ubuntu
11:39	<kbrooks>	Chousuke: umm.
11:39	<Ng>	bbrazil: fair enough, thanks :)
11:39	<sduffy>	Soir: where is the release?
11:39	<Linuturk>	i386-desktop is going fast for me, and I'm not connected to any seeds
11:39	<apokryphos>	sduffy: /topic
11:39	<ompaul>	hi thoreauputic
11:39	<Balachmar>	I get Requested download is not authorized with this tracker... How do I fix that?
11:39	<GazzaK>	 Ubuntu can now be installed to USB devices, such as removable
11:39	<GazzaK>	 hard drives and flash memory, using the text-mode installer
11:39	<leleobhz>	a superseed for ubuntu now
11:39	<GazzaK>	woo
11:39	<kbrooks>	Chousuke: bittorent does not use up that
11:39	<Flannel>	woooohooo.  Now, all we need is seeders for desktop and server...
11:39	<bbrazil>	Ng: results may vary etc.
11:39	<cef>	yup the alternate torrents are the only ones working - http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
11:40	<mdz>	bliss_: the sparc CDs will be released somewhat later; see the announcement
11:40	<thoreauputic>	ompaul: heheh - bit of excitement in the air :)
11:40	<khermans>	Balachmar, a lot of us are getting that error
11:40	<Seveas>	bliss_, and why do you think he'd tell the forums without telling us? 
11:40	<mdz>	the torrents are being worked on
11:40	<Chousuke>	kbrooks: well, it will if I forget it on for that long :P
11:40	<kbrooks>	Chousuke: it uses up WHAT you set foor uploading
11:40	<mdz>	they're coming up one at a time
11:40	<leleobhz>	a moment
11:40	<ompaul>	thoreauputic, so it appears
11:40	<mdz>	the alternates happen to be first alphabetically
11:40	<kbrooks>	Chousuke: no, it won't.
11:40	<leleobhz>	torrent rejected me! :[
11:40	<rixth>	So supposedly it has been released, but on ISOs are available?
11:40	<Godfather-Off>	Seveas, how is possible that official release has kenerl 2.6.15.6 and other releases has 2.6.15.23 ?
11:40	<Chousuke>	besides I'm not sure how much bw I have left before the limit.
11:40	<charle97>	my alternate torrent download is kicking ass
11:40	<mind>	Cand anyone help me configure X to allow refresh rates higher than 60 hz ?
11:40	<ompaul>	mdz, question, dvds are they anywhere yet?
11:40	<Polibio>	in this page: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html  they say that the definitive Kernel is 2.6.15.6, but I already have kernel 2.6.15.23, how can it be?
11:40	<Soir>	and people wonder why I like apt ;)
11:40	<kbrooks>	Chousuke: fine.
11:40	<Seveas>	Godfather-Off, 2.5.15-23 == 2.6.15.6
11:40	<Big_T>	hi
11:40	<Seveas>	a - is not a .

11:42	<protocol1>	thoreauputic, but is there a way to check between beta or the official?
11:42	<snowblink>	Flannel, ajmitch_, cheers. Will install soon. :)
11:42	<thoreauputic>	guys, use the torrent to spare the servers :)
11:42	<Seveas>	bliss_, that was not a question...
11:42	<ompaul>	jcz`, sorry?
11:42	<apokryphos>	dbglt: /msg ubotu xgl
11:42	<CactusWiZaRd>	does every change that o
11:42	<elkbuntu>	kestas, if you're getting it from a mirror, it may not have synched yet
11:42	<jcz`>	ompaul, 'options on the greet screen'?   all i see is 'applications'  'places' and 'system' at the top of my desktop, im using dapper
11:43	<CactusWiZaRd>	i've* made, disappear?
11:43	<khermans>	thoreauputic, we are trying but they are faulty
11:43	<thoreauputic>	protocol1: I think I already answered you - if you are up to date, you have official
11:43	<protocol1>	ok thanks
11:43	<thoreauputic>	khermans: ah, OK
11:43	<elkbuntu>	Seveas, care to put the releases wiki page (ie the ones with the torrents) in the topic?
11:43	<Balachmar>	I'm super seeding the desktop torrent atm
11:43	<sduffy>	hmm, dapper has been on our mirror for a week now
11:43	<Balachmar>	It still complains about the tracker, but it does work...
11:43	<apokryphos>	sduffy: not official
11:43	<elkbuntu>	sduffy, that would have been RC
11:43	<ompaul>	jcz`, sorry I don't have a context for the question what are these options you are referring to
11:44	<Oddie>	Mithrandir: thx it loaded.... now to install it ;)
11:44	<locksy>	Is there a problem with the the torrents?
11:44	<kbrooks>	if i want to help distribute the torrent, what can i do?
11:44	<Flannel>	thoreauputic: we're waiting on seeds for desktop and server.  but, I'm torrenting all three! (just discovered btmany, very nice!)
11:44	<thoreauputic>	locksy: apparently
11:44	<apokryphos>	kbrooks: leave it seeding in your torrent client
11:44	<thoreauputic>	Flannel: :)
11:44	<kbrooks>	apokryphos: well, i dont need the iso ;)
11:44	<bbrazil>	kbrooks: start downloading, and leave it connected after you're finished
11:44	<rixth>	kbrooks, download it and leave your client open
11:44	<Big_T>	what is the difference by alternate and desktop releases? :S
11:44	<kbrooks>	Big_T: alternate = text mode
11:44	<l_r>	i wonder whether it takes more to install from cd and download/install the rest or wait for the dvd iso...any idea?
11:45	<thoreauputic>	Big_T: alternte is th e"install only" CD
11:45	<Flannel>	thoreauputic: heh.  this channel is so laggy.  bursts of like 20 lines.
11:45	<kbrooks>	Big_T: desktop = gui
11:45	<Big_T>	thanx kbrooks
11:45	<jcz`>	ompaul, im trying to log onto failsafe terminal
11:45	<thoreauputic>	Flannel: oh - I'm not seeing that here
11:45	<Nookie>	is ubuntu+1 channel down?
11:45	<bbrazil>	jcz`: try crtl-alt-f1
11:45	<Ng>	Nookie: since there is no ubuntu+1 yet, yes
11:45	<pseudodeadkitty>	Nookie: This IS #ubuntu+1 now.
11:45	<thoreauputic>	Nookie: until Edgy satarts
11:45	<speedsix>	Hi does anyone have any experience with transcode?
11:45	<thoreauputic>	*starts
11:46	<asdx_>	heck. more people here than in #debian lmao
11:46	<Lynoure>	Flannel: The channel is not laggy, your connection is...
11:46	<Big_T>	Downstream: 263.26kb/s  Upstream: 4.98kb/s
11:46	<KenSentMe>	can i download torrents using the command line?
11:46	<agwibowo>	has anyone tried compiz + xgl in ubuntu? the one in suse is a bit dodgy
11:46	<LivingTarget>	ubuntu ftw
11:46	<rubso>	guys, could you please give me a torrnet link?
11:46	<Linuturk>	heh, so when is Edgy out? (just kidding) :-P
11:46	<apokryphos>	agwibowo: 10.1? Doubt it. Though: /msg ubotu xgl
11:46	<bbrazil>	KenSentMe: yes, forget the name of the program - apt-cache search bittorrent
11:46	<Lukketto>	http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
11:46	<thoreauputic>	Linuturk: when it's ready ;P
11:46	<Linuturk>	rubso it's in the topic
11:46	<ompaul>	jcz`, did that sort you out?
11:46	<rubso>	ok ;)
11:46	<mind>	Cand anyone help me configure X to allow refresh rates higher than 60 hz ?
11:47	<locksy>	The tracker http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/ seems to have different names for the torrents than is on http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
11:47	<Linuturk>	for heavens sake
11:47	<khermans>	http://www.ubuntu.com/download still points to Breezy
11:47	<bliss_>	Seveas: without being rude why was ompail kicked out?
11:47	<kbrooks>	do i have to keep the iso AFTER i d/l it?
11:47	<thoreauputic>	khermans: correct
11:47	<evad>	khermans: just click a mirror and change 5.10 in the url to 6.06
11:47	<bliss_>	ompaul
11:47	<Seveas>	bliss_, for being irish ;)
11:47	<evad>	:P
11:47	<Lukketto>	about kubuntu-dapper?
11:47	<thoreauputic>	khermans: I noticed that too
11:47	<luis_>	where is the download link??
11:47	<khermans>	thoreauputic, intentional?
11:47	<khermans>	ok
11:47	<kbrooks>	bliss_: you think that's rude to ask?
11:47	<kestas>	http://mirror.pacific.net.au/linux/ubuntu-releases/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-rc-desktop-i386.iso is this the right one? it has RC in it :P
11:47	<thoreauputic>	khermans: don't know
11:47	<speedsix>	anyone use transcode?
11:48	<COSM0S>	hello, anyone can help me with vmware?
11:48	<cef>	no. not the -rc- release
11:48	<evad>	kestas: then......no
11:48	<BadriNarayan>	kestas: no
11:48	<jcz`>	ompaul, well now i see a command line screen, wat do i do next to logon to failsafe terminal ? my problem is dapper is taking almost 5 minutes to logon after typing in my username and pw
11:48	<khermans>	speedsix, try gtranscode if you are unfamiliar
11:48	<khermans>	COSM0S, yea
11:48	<kestas>	evad: all of the mirrors seem to have rc only
11:48	<agwibowo>	whats gtranscode for?
11:48	<COSM0S>	ty kermans
11:48	<bliss_>	Seveas: yes i kinow he is Irish but lets no joke about it
11:48	<BadriNarayan>	jcz; type xinit
11:48	<orbin>	kbrooks: er, if you're seeding it, i think you need the complete file   ... not 100% sure though
11:48	<khermans>	agwibowo, a frontend
11:48	<evad>	kestas: I found one with 6.06
11:48	<dooglus>	kbrooks: you should keep the iso if you want to help seed it, yes
11:48	<COSM0S>	i'm using vmware's image with a NAT connection
11:48	<agwibowo>	ok...
11:48	<COSM0S>	simple i wanna know
11:48	<evad>	cough http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
11:48	<agwibowo>	only 6 seeds at the moment... :(
11:48	<speedsix>	khermans I'm getting errors with the command line transcode so I think a frontend would fail still :(
11:48	<derfbugzi>	any one got DVD torrent links?
11:49	<ompaul>	jcz`, what spec is the hardware you have?
11:49	<COSM0S>	have i to use a firewall on the image?
11:49	<noodle>	\topic
11:49	<Verithrax>	Hm, it's possible to update to dapper automatically already, right?
11:49	<thoreauputic>	I think yesterday's daily is the same ISO - anyone confirm that?
11:49	<KenSentMe>	bbrazil i've just installed the package bittorrent, but can't seem to run it. Or do i need an other package too?
11:49	<Healot>	you guys prefer bt?
11:49	<Lukketto>	Verithax: ues
11:49	<bbrazil>	KenSentMe: I think rtorrent is what you're looking for
11:49	<Healot>	bt network is like worm speed nowadays
11:49	<Grunt>	hey is it finally out now?
11:49	<Lukketto>	Verythax: yes
11:49	<kbrooks>	thoreauputic: it isnt
11:49	<Verithrax>	Running upgrade-manager normally doesn't tell me about dapper.
11:49	<agwibowo>	Grunt: yes
11:49	<amac-laptop>	Yep. Show your love: http://digg.com/linux_unix/Ubuntu_Dapper_Drake_Officially_Released
11:49	<rubso>	Linuturk: dapper-desktop-i386.iso am i right?
11:49	<jcz`>	ompaul, sempron 3000 cpu with 1 gig ram
11:49	<thoreauputic>	Healot: bittorrent is better for these ISO s and should be fast
11:49	<Grunt>	Excellent, thanks
11:49	<bbrazil>	KenSentMe: haven't used bt myself
11:50	<thoreauputic>	kbrooks: OK - thanks
11:50	<evad>	there is no "bt network" so if your torrents are slow it's just those torrents that are slow :P
11:50	<Verithrax>	Running upgrade-manager -d does, but it dies when I try to upgrade.
11:50	<evad>	well unless you mean British Telecom network :P
11:50	<selinium>	Verithrax: Have you changed your sources.list to point to dapper?
11:50	<OmniD>	cocks
11:50	<Lukketto>	Verythax: system->administration->	update
11:50	<trygvebw>	has it been officially released yet?
11:50	<Ng>	evad: or that your ISP isn't friendly to BT
11:50	<ompaul>	jcz`, that is *not right* there is something very wrong with that
11:50	<HairyDude>	how do you get aptitude to forget all holds?
11:50	<asdx_>	http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
11:50	<trygvebw>	or only kubuntu?
11:50	<cef>	hrm. 4535kB/s total.. hrmmmm not high enough
11:50	<Polibio>	in this page: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html  they say that the definitive Kernel is 2.6.15.6, but I already have kernel 2.6.15-23, how can it be?
11:50	<packman_e>	hello all
11:50	<Lukketto>	verythax: without -d
11:50	<jcz`>	ompaul, when i type xinit + pw it just gives me 'login incorrect'
11:50	<evad>	Ng: possibly....
11:50	<Grunt>	3 hrs to download :-(
11:50	<Healot>	the upgrade from breezy to dapper is like 200MB or something. huge
11:50	<mnk>	hello all - how do i do a distribution upgrade from dapper beta  to  final release?
11:51	<bliss_>	ompaul: good to have you back
11:51	<Verithrax>	Doesn't work. I have to change the source list? I thought it did that by itself.
11:51	<pschulz01>	#ubuntu-devel
11:51	<Lukketto>	Healot: it takes 1 hour for me
11:51	<agwibowo>	Grunt: 1 day and 13 hours
11:51	<Patrick1>	mnk: apt-get dist-upgrade
11:51	<ompaul>	jcz`, no to do that you log in with your usual username and password
11:51	<backz>	what's ubuntu 'alternate'?
11:51	<bbrazil>	Polibio: one is the ubuntu version, the other the linux versioning
11:51	<Seveas>	backz, text-mode install
11:51	<Auckland_Pig>	can anyone tell me how fast torrents are?
11:51	<Auckland_Pig>	please :)
11:51	<OmniD>	TOO fast
11:51	<PeanutHorst>	Auckland_Pig: um
11:52	<Grunt>	its killing me and I have a 2mb connection speed...are there any mirrors ready yet?
11:52	<dooglus>	Auckland_Pig: not fast at the moment - about 120Kb/s down
11:52	<mnk>	don't i have to 'update' the package files thingy?
11:52	<Lukketto>	verythax: did you change your souce-list?
11:52	<OmniD>	120 down is pretty fast
11:52	<Seveas>	Grunt, nl.releases.ubuntu.com
11:52	<PeanutHorst>	Auckland_Pig: depends on the strength of connection, speed of seed host, other leeches, etc.
11:52	<jcz`>	ompaul, how do i login to failsafe terminal ?
11:52	<mnk>	cos my system is saying nothing to upgrade
11:52	<Big_T>	Auckland_Pig at the beginning slow but after a few hours it will be ultra fast :)
11:52	<backz>	dapper servers comes with Xorg?
11:52	<dooglus>	OmniD: it'll get faster - there are 9 seeds and 127 peers at the moment...
11:52	<Polibio>	bbrazil, thanks, do you know what is the definitive Ubuntu version in Dapper?   I say that because 2.6.15-23 give me some problems with the wifi card
11:52	<dmb062082>	woohoo just installd ubuntu64
11:52	<Auckland_Pig>	ok
11:52	<kestas>	backz: nope
11:52	<thoreauputic>	Auckland_Pig: it will speed up as more seeds come in
11:52	<Healot>	backz: yes xorg as the previous release
11:52	<phatmonkey>	does anyone have any logs of #ubuntu+1 from yesterday? i need an error message i got for a bug report
11:53	<dmb062082>	amazing guys, pain in the ass setting xserver-xorg with my monitor and vid card though heh
11:53	<dmb062082>	but im all set
11:53	<Auckland_Pig>	ok
11:53	<ThE-LiGhT>	 /msg ubotu upgrade
11:53	<bbrazil>	Polibio: there's no real difference between the 2.6.15.x kernels, mostly security fixes
11:53	<ThE-LiGhT>	 /msg ubotu upgrade
11:53	<COSM0S>	someone can help me with vmware please?
11:53	<backz>	dapper server uses another package repo? because it will be supported for five years.
11:53	<apokryphos>	ThE-LiGhT: no space before /
11:53	<khermans>	COSM0S, i offered to help
11:53	<ompaul>	jcz`, okay, bottom left of the gui screen - options - failsafe terminal   -- then log in
11:53	<Big_T>	now i will lose windows forever :D
11:53	<Kr0ntab>	adios #ubuntu+1  hehe...
11:53	<Verithrax>	I didn't change my sourse list before... I did now...
11:53	<COSM0S>	i'm using vmware's image with a NAT connection
11:53	<Verithrax>	Let me try again.
11:53	<dmb062082>	now for apt-get install kde, its just not working, so my question is, is there a command to get the entire kde package, and whats the 1st thing i should be doing as a new user update wise?
11:53	<jcz`>	ompaul, each time i quit dapper i only get 'system halting' or sumthing like that, it never actually shuts off, i have to push my external power off button to do that
11:53	<Lynoure>	Big_T: congrats for that :)
11:53	<dmb062082>	thanks in advance
11:53	<COSM0S>	have i to use a firewall on the image?
11:54	<Grunt>	Thanks Seveas
11:54	<khermans>	Kr0ntab, oh its still here -- no its edgy
11:54	<apokryphos>	dmb062082: install kubuntu-desktop
11:54	<ThE-LiGhT>	apokryphos, yeah, i fixed it :)
11:54	<kestas>	Ill be the first to grep all the text files for my admin pass :P
11:54	<TheMadman>	why are there 3 seperate .iso images on torrent.ubuntu.com for the dapper-desktop-amd64 iso?
11:54	<khermans>	COSM0S, if you want
11:54	<Polibio>	bbrazil, but mi wifi card works perfectly in 2.6.15-19 and not in 2.6.15-23
11:54	<Kr0ntab>	phatmonkey, I thinks I have the logs
11:54	<siccness>	3 years is mad
11:54	<jcz`>	ompaul, how do i get out of this failsafe terminal now ?
11:54	<kestas>	TheMadman: 2 of them wipe your system
11:54	<COSM0S>	but is it necessary?
11:54	<ompaul>	jcz`, is it a black screen?
11:54	<bbrazil>	Polibio: odd, wifi is out of my experiance though
11:54	<leleobhz>	bbrazil: ubuntu-br?
11:54	<COSM0S>	or is it enought to use on the host?
11:54	<jcz`>	black command line screen yes
11:54	<Polibio>	bbrazil, ok, thanks vm
11:54	<ompaul>	jcz`, type exit
11:54	<bbrazil>	!br
11:54	<ubotu>	Por favor use #ubuntu-br (/j #ubuntu-br) para ajuda em portugues. Obrigada.
11:55	<Verithrax>	Yeah, it finds the source.
11:55	<leleobhz>	:p
11:55	<khermans>	COSM0S, it depends how your setup the networking part
11:55	<leleobhz>	bbrazil: im there! :] 
11:55	<jcz`>	ompaul, i did that already
11:55	<leleobhz>	im asking about you
11:55	<khermans>	if it is NAT, then your host firewall i think is fine
11:55	<mind>	Cand anyone help me configure X to allow refresh rates higher than 60 hz ? thanks
11:55	<bbrazil>	leleobhz: /whois
11:55	<Sonderblade>	!se
11:55	<ubotu>	Svensk Ubuntu- och Kubuntusupport hittar du pa #ubuntu-se resp. #kubuntu-se
11:55	<COSM0S>	it is simple a nat
11:55	<khermans>	COSM0S, however, what do you lose if you have a friewall in the image too
11:55	<jcz`>	ompaul, it just says 'localhost login'
11:55	<ompaul>	jcz`,
11:55	<mnk>	how do i update the sources.list? my system says there is nothing to upgrade
11:55	<Verithrax>	Well thar she blows.
11:55	<dmb062082>	install kubuntu-desktop, will this just add the  kde gui to my boot up display manager with the option to boot into kde? Or totally replace ubuntu
11:55	<apokryphos>	mnk: /msg ubotu upgrade
11:55	<dmb062082>	sorry I dont know much
11:55	<Verithrax>	Through apt, but GUIs inherently suck anyway.
11:55	<TheMadman>	so uh is there any official releases other than bittorrents
11:56	<leleobhz>	bbrazil: :P
11:56	<ompaul>	jcz`, so your out of it that is a standard terminal, the one you want to go to is Ctrl+Alt+F7
11:56	<trygvebw>	dmb062082, add the option
11:56	<apokryphos>	dmb062082: it will add the option
11:56	<TheMadman>	er are there
11:56	<COSM0S>	i think that the image can be more slow
11:56	<dmb062082>	woohoo awesome!!
11:56	<dmb062082>	I love you guys

11:59	<ubotu>	okay, kbrooks
11:59	<KenSentMe>	lol, my torrents are uploading more than they are downloading
11:59	<Lukketto>	what are the differences between "dapper-desktop-i386.iso"  AND  "ubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso" ???
11:59	<khermans>	Grunt, installing LAMP on Windows is, by definition, impossible :-)
11:59	<dmb062082>	later guys
11:59	<leleobhz>	my torrent i386 is not downloading
11:59	<cef>	dooglus: woo!
11:59	<evad>	Lukketto: read http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
11:59	<Astinus->	kbrooks: haven't seen that option ..
11:59	<kbrooks>	khermans: WAMP exists
11:59	<jcz`>	ompaul, how do i troubleshoot my 5 minute logon delay ?
11:59	<Linuturk>	nvu isn't all that great
11:59	<Grunt>	true what i should have said was WAMP ;-)
11:59	<agwibowo>	KenSentMe: mine too!!! 70 KB/s upload, 3KB/s download
11:59	<chrisbudden14__>	what the speed like on the torrents for you guys?
11:59	<Linuturk>	nvu isn't all that great
11:59	<ompaul>	jcz`, if you want a terminal that is where you go, if you want failsafe then you do what I suggested, bottom left of the gui - then log in
11:59	<khermans>	kbrooks, of cource -- my point
11:59	<dooglus>	Lukketto: alternate is text-only; desktop is live+ graphical install
11:59	<phatmonkey>	 how can i update from the RC? are the repositories updated yet? - anybody?
11:59	<ompaul>	jcz`, then check what your loading at the start
11:59	<khermans>	Linuturk, alright use emacs then
12:00	<Linuturk>	heh, my irc client is lagging
12:00	<dooglus>	phatmonkey: just update as usual.  apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
12:00	<cef>	phatmonkey: use rsync
12:00	<agwibowo>	phatmonkey: you should just need to run apt-get
12:00	<kbrooks>	phatmonkey: just update
12:00	<phatmonkey>	ok, nothing there yet
12:00	<cute_bettong>	http://www.deviantart.com/view/34111635/
12:00	<leleobhz>	someone with problems with torrent?
12:00	<zcat[1] >	I've just started torrenting all the desktop iso's .. good speed into the NZ backbone so hopefully this will help everyone a little :)
12:00	<mnk>	which file tells me which release i'm using pls?
12:00	<jcz`>	ompaul, ok i dont see options on my bottom left gui
12:00	<dooglus>	phatmonkey: nothing changed since the pcmcia update a few hours ago
12:00	<cef>	phatmonkey: rsync will update the .iso, or if you've installed, just use apt-get
12:00	<mnk>	is there something like /etc/ubuntu-release ?
12:00	<kbrooks>	why is live AND desktop good? what does it bring to the user?
12:01	<bbrazil>	Linuturk: you can use traffic control to gaurentee irc etc. bandwidth
12:01	<khermans>	Least popular torrent:
12:01	<khermans>	<cmisra@nic.umass.edu>,
12:01	<khermans>	whoops
12:01	<Terminus->	mnk: type 'lsb_release -a' in a console. :)
12:01	<phatmonkey>	haha, now it gets fixed. my upgrade died from a pcmcia problem
12:01	<kbrooks>	why is live AND desktop good? what does it bring to the user?
12:01	<ompaul>	jcz`, how did you get dapper?
12:01	<dooglus>	kbrooks: it means I can try ubuntu without affecting windows, and then install it if I like it, all from the same CD
12:01	<zcat[1] >	kbrooks: test your hardware before you install, prettyier installer, do other stuff while you wait..
12:02	<cef>	kbrooks: you can play with it, and install from it using a graphical interface
12:02	<dooglus>	kbrooks: previously I had to download 2 huge iso files - one to try, and one to install.
12:02	<thoreauputic>	kbrooks: more like what it brings to the shipit distribution method ( lower costs)
12:02	<Afief>	Can someone tell me where to get dapper from? the homepage still links to breezy
12:02	<jcz`>	i downloaded it off torrents if i recall correctly about 10 days ago
12:02	<jcz`>	ompaul
12:02	<kbrooks>	dooglus: now you have to get 1 iso file?
12:02	<Oddie>	dooglus: is there a way of installing the ubuntu from boot without having to load the live? I dont have much ram?
12:02	<owlmanatt>	happy dapper day
12:02	<khermans>	Lest popular: ubuntu-6.06-server-amd64.iso
12:02	<lightstar>	Afief, http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
12:02	<ajmitch_>	zcat[1] : 100Mbps+ ?
12:02	<dooglus>	Oddie: I don't know
12:02	<ompaul>	jcz`, I read that, okay, and you installed then, when did it start going that slow?
12:02	<dooglus>	kbrooks: right.
12:02	<thoreauputic>	kbrooks: built-in installer on the desktop/live CD
12:02	<Terminus->	Oddie: alternate cd i think. :)
12:02	<dooglus>	kbrooks: the 'desktop' one is both live cd and install cd
12:02	<kbrooks>	khermans: if course it is, amd64 sux after all
12:03	<jcz`>	ompaul, the first time i rebooted after installing it
12:03	<derfbugzi>	Does anyone know if there will be a dvd release?
12:03	<zcat[1] >	ajmitch_: 100Mbps minus whatever the webserver sucks up..
12:03	<K|NgGh0sT>	I installed nvidia drivers, and now it seems that my DPI is messed up, anyone know how to fix this?
12:03	<bbrazil>	derfbugzi: yes, we're still wating on it
12:03	<ajmitch_>	zcat[1] : a shame I'm not downloading then :)
12:03	<kestas>	how come the server and desktop cds are seperate? server is just desktop minus some packages right?
12:03	<ompaul>	jcz`,  that is an indication that something is very wrong even my slowest machine is nothing like that
12:03	<derfbugzi>	bbrazil, cheers
12:03	<bbrazil>	kestas: kinda
12:04	<Linuturk>	server has a completely different kernel
12:04	<Linuturk>	it's optimized to run on a server
12:04	<ompaul>	jcz`, okay do this: Ctrl+Alt+F1
12:04	<khermans>	kestas, i think you can type "server" from a desktop CD
12:04	<ompaul>	jcz`, log in and tell me when your in
12:04	<siccness>	dooglus, so the 'desktop' is both desktop/live cd?
12:04	<kestas>	Linuturk: you'd think they'd just put a different deb on a single cd
12:04	<siccness>	and alternative is just desktop/install?
12:04	<kestas>	Linuturk: a different deb for the optimised kernel
12:04	<siccness>	s/alternative/alternate
12:04	<ukh>	no, least popular is server-sparc, since it isn't there yet...
12:04	<selinium>	derfbugzi: There is one, look in the torrents http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
12:04	<bbrazil>	siccness: alternate is text install
12:04	<kestas>	khermans: k
12:04	<malte`>	happy dapper day :D
12:04	<jcz`>	ompaul, ok im in
12:05	<siccness>	Ohhhh shi.....
12:05	<siccness>	:|
12:05	<dooglus>	siccness: desktop is live+install; alternate is a text based install
12:05	<siccness>	I'm glad I haven't downloaded anything
12:05	<khermans>	Linuturk, can you still use "server" from a desktop CD?
12:05	<siccness>	Thanks guys
12:05	<K|NgGh0sT>	I installed nvidia drivers, and now it seems that my DPI is messed up, anyone know how to fix this?
12:05	<siccness>	Heh :|
12:05	<kestas>	this day is like a million christmases in one
12:05	<Linuturk>	not anymore
12:05	<mnk>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
12:05	<bbrazil>	siccness: as long as you have the right arch, one can be changed to the other
12:05	<twager>	Can anyone tell me if it is ok to install a 32 bit linux  distro on a 64 bit system ?
12:05	<mnk>	what does LTS mean?
12:05	<siccness>	bbrazil, oh ok.
12:05	<siccness>	Long Term Support
12:05	<dooglus>	Long Term support
12:05	<kestas>	long term service
12:05	<mnk>	[sorry about all the qs] 
12:06	<mnk>	aah cool
12:06	<bbrazil>	twager: on amd64 or sparc64, yes
12:06	<Fillado>	what should you use to run a graphical app as root from a terminal?
12:06	<kestas>	service I say!
12:06	<siccness>	Support I say!
12:06	<mnk>	so it is upgraded then? :)
12:06	<ompaul>	jcz`, type this: sudo apt-get update
12:06	<khermans>	Fillado, gksudo
12:06	<Celestar>	where can I find the difference between the "desktop" and "server" versions?
12:06	<Fillado>	as i'm told sudo isn't a good idea
12:06	<lmanul>	kestas: Support :)
12:06	<Fillado>	ah thanks
12:06	<ompaul>	!root
12:06	<ubotu>	Direct login as the root user is disabled in Ubuntu. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
12:06	<mnk>	I LOVE UBUNTU
12:06	<mnk>	:d
12:06	<mnk>	:D
12:06	<khermans>	sudo su root
12:06	<isoTop>	wow this channel is bigger than #gentoo
12:06	<freddo>	lts: Long Time for the Success:p
12:06	<twager>	thanks..I need a new mobo and 32 bit are quite rare
12:06	<ompaul>	Fillado, wrong :-) it is the best thing since sliced bread please read that link ;-)
12:07	<flodine>	cant find the mirror site for alternate iso
12:07	<dxdemetriou>	From http://releases.ubuntu.com/dapper/ is the final release? I haven't see the Dapper in the website and Update Manager.
12:07	<jcz`>	ompaul, im by dapper isnt online currently, does that matter ?
12:07	<zcat[1] >	I don
12:07	<dooglus>	ompaul: he means wrt running gui apps.
12:07	<ompaul>	jcz`, yeap
12:07	<jcz`>	ompaul, my dapper isnt online currently, does that matter ?
12:07	<ompaul>	jcz`, it needs to be
12:07	<dooglus>	ompaul: there are some here who claim that using sudo to run gui apps can mess things upo
12:07	<zcat[1] >	I don't think I've had anything through dist-upgrade for most of the day so I'm probably running what's on the CD now anyhow :)
12:07	<Fillado>	ompaul: ya what?
12:08	<ompaul>	dooglus, I am one of them :-) so noted Fillado your talking gui
12:08	<Flannel>	dooglus: that's correct.  use gksudo.
12:08	<ompaul>	Fillado your talking gui gksudo
12:08	<evad>	dooglus: how? sudo runs it as the root user - it works just fine and there cannot be (due to the way unix works) any bad side affects
12:08	<Fillado>	ya
12:08	<dooglus>	Flannel: do you have any example of how sudo can mess anything up?  like a repeatable case?
12:08	<jcz`>	ok, i have to switch cables, so i'll rejoin the channel using my linux box after i swap ethernet cables, be right back
12:08	<ompaul>	jcz`, let me give you instructions first
12:08	<Flannel>	evad: it's bugs in the qt library
12:09	<Afief>	Isn't there a liveCD/Install CD of ubuntu anymore?
12:09	<jcz`>	ok
12:09	<dooglus>	evad: I'm with you on this, yet people (like ompaul just did) continue to claim that sudo is a bad idea
12:09	<thoreauputic>	sudo can mess up ~/.ICEauthority on KDE, and .Xauthority
12:09	<Fillado>	Afief: Yes, that's the desktop one :)
12:09	<khermans>	dooglus, if there is a bad bug -- it could possibly hose your system
12:09	<evad>	oh
12:09	<apokryphos>	Afief: no, the setup has changed. There's an install+live CD (the desktop CD), and there's an old fashioned text install CD: the alternate CD
12:09	<slackern>	argh, so annoying that when you connect through places to a server that is down that it locks up almost everything till it times out.
12:09	<dooglus>	khermans: that's true of sudo and gksudo both
12:09	<jcz`>	ompaul, ok
12:09	<khermans>	dooglus, of course
12:09	<zcat[1] >	you can run gui stuff from the terminal as 'sudo foo', i don't think there's any major difference... if you already have a terminal open. For alt-F2 you'd use gksudo because it can ask for password through a window..
12:09	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: I've only seen sudo cause problems with KDE apps, personally
12:09	<evad>	I enable root on Ubuntu anyway, sudo passwd root really isn't difficult.
12:09	<keiron>	yo
12:09	<ompaul>	jcz`, sudo apt-get update <then >	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade <then reboot>	to enable the ethernet connection the cheap dirty way is >	sudo dhclient
12:10	<khermans>	thoreauputic, kdelibs try to make sure you dont have setuid or setguid
12:10	<keiron>	i see 6.06 has been released. when can i expect apt to get updated so i can do the update through there?
12:10	<Afief>	apokryphos: so.... if i want to install, i have to boot into ubuntu live first?
12:10	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: does it still?  I think that was fixed some time ago
12:10	<apokryphos>	Afief: correct
12:10	<Flannel>	!gksudo
12:10	<ubotu>	Use gksudo to run qt applications with root privileges. Using sudo to start gtk apps can scramble your user account permissions.
12:10	<Linuturk>	5 hours until I'm only seeding server i386
12:10	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: you may be right - this was last year IIRC
12:10	<ryanakca>	what packages should I install for a lamp server?
12:10	<Rambo3>	1020 users
12:10	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: k3b was one offender I remember
12:10	<ompaul>	dooglus, I wish you had acked the fact that I agreed with you the statement I saw was without reference to gui - and I did concur that gk was the way with gnome
12:10	<zcat[1] >	thanks Flannel I didn't know that :)
12:10	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: k3b used to cause problems
12:10	<Afief>	apokryphos: is everything alright with that? i mean, i have some bad experience with some of those live-installers
12:11	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: right
12:11	<Nookie>	!libdvdcss
12:11	<ubotu>	I heard libdvdcss is (DVD playing is possible in ubuntu. You may need libdvdcss2, which is available via http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages (section extras)) for i386. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats for PPC and amd64
12:11	<bbrazil>	ryanakca: apache2, mysql-server, libapache-php4
12:11	<apokryphos>	Afief: it's the paciest/smoothest install I've ever done, probably
12:11	<tubbie>	!amarok
12:11	<ubotu>	hmm... amarok is a music player for Linux and Unix with an intuitive interface. See http://amarok.kde.org ; amaroK's features: http://amarok.kde.org/content/view/51/1/ - To install Amarok 1.4 on Ubuntu, see http://kubuntu.org/announcements/amarok-1.4.php
12:11	<dooglus>	ompaul: I'm still not convinced that there's any need to use gksudo as opposed to sudo though
12:11	<bbrazil>	!lamp
12:11	<keiron>	!dapper
12:11	<ubotu>	DAPPER IS OUT! PARTY TIME! https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html
12:11	<Flannel>	!tell ryanakca about lamp

12:11	<ubotu>	Fillado: NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
12:11	<CrippsFX>	does anybody know how to fix sound problems in ET? the output from ET says that "/dev/dsp" is busy, or in use ... although, I don't have any programs using sound open ...
12:11	<Grunt>	Hey I just wondered if there are any release parties happening in Birmingham, UK at all?
12:11	<Afief>	apokryphos: have the changed the partitioning scheme? that was about the only thing that bugged me in breezy
12:11	<apokryphos>	dooglus: there is; plain sudo doesn't set up the environment approprtiately for GUI applications
12:11	<zcat[1] >	twice the traffic up as down. cool... must be helping someone :)
12:11	<keiron>	when will the apt sources be updated to allow installation of dapper??!
12:12	<bbrazil>	Grunt: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseParties
12:12	<thoreauputic>	Grunt: you have parties in Birmingham ? /me runs
12:12	<dooglus>	apokryphos: in what sense?
12:12	<thoreauputic>	Grunt: ;P
12:12	<Beginer>	Can I use dial-up for internet on Ubuntu 6.06 Live CD?
12:12	<ajmitch_>	zcat[1] : yeah, I can upload at a whole 50K/sec.. not really worth it :)
12:12	<bbrazil>	Grunt: there's one in Dublin if you want to fly over :)
12:12	<thoreauputic>	Beginer: yes
12:12	<apokryphos>	dooglus: many (particularly GTK, often I've seen) will be fine with the transition, but others you might have serious problems with. I've seen many cases where dcop sockets get mucked up, config files get incorrect permissions etc
12:12	<Grunt>	I just wondered the only party on the list was in London
12:12	<jcz`>	ompaul, doesnt dapper automatically detect my ethernet connections within 30 seconds after i physically  insert my ethernet connector into back of the mobo ?
12:12	<xukun>	!dapper
12:12	<ubotu>	DAPPER IS OUT! PARTY TIME! https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html
12:12	<siccness>	Hammer time!
12:12	<dooglus>	apokryphos: do you know of any case where it still happens?
12:13	<dxdemetriou>	The gksudo "update-manager -d" is not for beta?
12:13	<apokryphos>	dooglus: I'm pretty sure it can still happen, yes of course.
12:13	<zcat[1] >	!botsnack
12:13	<ubotu>	thanks zcat[1]  :)
12:13	<tubbie>	I have amarok 1.3.9 and I just added a new repo to get amarok 1.4. how do I update amarok?
12:13	<Celestar>	tadadada
12:13	<dooglus>	apokryphos: I'm looking for a specific example.
12:13	<apokryphos>	dxdemetriou: eh?
12:13	<bvanaerde>	!pony
12:13	<ubotu>	bvanaerde: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
12:13	<CrippsFX>	tubbie, apt-get upgrade amarok
12:13	<Fillado>	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
12:13	<apokryphos>	dooglus: well, fire up kate with sudo, play with things, change some settings, and then see, perhaps.
12:13	<Verithrax>	!botsnack
12:13	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: no
12:13	<ubotu>	thanks verithrax :)
12:13	<Verithrax>	That's cute.
12:14	<CrippsFX>	apokryphos, why not?
12:14	<Fillado>	^^Tubbie
12:14	<dxdemetriou>	apokryphos: I readed for this command is for beta packages. The Update Manager will not ask for upgrade to Dapper normally?
12:14	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: to upgrade to latest amaroK you have to /msg ubotu amarok
12:14	<cef>	hrm, 6.8gb downloaded from the torrent
12:14	<thoreauputic>	dxdemetriou: it should now
12:14	<dooglus>	apokryphos: are you saying it only happens with KDE apps?  I don't have any of those
12:14	<apokryphos>	dxdemetriou: follow the same method for upgrading from rc. /msg ubotu rc
12:14	<cef>	8.85 now.. moving fast!
12:14	<apokryphos>	dooglus: well I'm a KDE user, so I only have experience with KDE :)
12:14	<Favorit>	hi there guys
12:14	<Beginer>	How to set modem on a Live CD?
12:14	<grimboy>	!tell bvanaerde about ponie
12:14	<thoreauputic>	apokryphos: boo - hiss ;-)
12:15	<Favorit>	i got a well known maybe problem which i'm pondering how to solve.
12:15	<alexey__>	hi all !
12:15	<CrippsFX>	apokryphos, once the repo is added to /etc/apt/sources.list doing an apt-get update and apt-get upgrade amarok should do it.
12:15	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: the main repositories do not have the latest version of amarok
12:15	<Rambo3>	lucky i got my copies  of official dapper from chinese blackmarket , before it was  released
12:15	<apokryphos>	but if you /msg ubotu amarok you can ge tit
12:15	<apokryphos>	get it
12:15	<Favorit>	i compiled 2.6.16 on ubuntu 5.10, amd64, and device mapper complains about dm-linear Device lookup failed
12:15	<khermans>	Rambo3, yeah me too
12:15	<tubbie>	thanks  :)
12:15	<CrippsFX>	apokryphos, I know that. He said that he's already added the repo for it.
12:15	<thoreauputic>	Beginer: System - Admin - Networking
12:15	<alexey__>	I am a SUSE Linux user and want to evaluate Ubuntu/Kubuntu. One question - is there a complete GNOME/KDE Ubuntu DVD?
12:15	<Favorit>	further on it just hangs on i/o
12:15	<bvanaerde>	grimboy: the bot is scared of me ;)
12:15	<dooglus>	apokryphos: yet you use gksudo?
12:15	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: oh right; then you can just sudo apt-get install amarok, yes
12:16	<grimboy>	Heh
12:16	<apokryphos>	dooglus: no, I use kdesu. gksudo is the GTK-equivalent
12:16	<CrippsFX>	apokryphos, yep. Ya just missed that part of the message in the lines above :)
12:16	<khermans>	alexey__, not sure -- but you can easily install the kubuntu-desktop on top of Ubuntu
12:16	<Beginer>	But its not recognizeing it
12:16	<kayde>	How do i get gksudo "update-manager -d to update to dapper?
12:16	<apokryphos>	kayde: /msg ubotu rc
12:16	<thoreauputic>	Beginer: do you have a software modem?

12:17	<thoreauputic>	Beginer: you need a hardware modem or a supported soft modem like a lucent
12:17	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, depends. what information do you have to give us about what you already have?
12:17	<cmug>	Is 6.06 available for download yet?
12:17	<zcat[1] >	is lucent still supported?
12:17	<Beginer>	Whats software modem?
12:17	<derfbugzi>	http://www.ubuntu.com/download is finally updated
12:17	<apokryphos>	cmug: yes; /topic
12:17	<dooglus>	kayde: you don't need the -d any more...  all you need to do is make sure you're up to date - click 'update' and 'install' and it should offer you dapper
12:17	<derfbugzi>	http://www.ubuntu.com/download
12:17	<cmug>	apokryphos, oh yeah, thanks

12:19	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, in the gnome system menu, choose administration>networking
12:19	<Healot>	Beginer: is it a PCI modem. or a serial modem?
12:19	<thoreauputic>	Beginer: time for a trip to linmodems.org then to see if it is supported or not
12:19	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : and I tried the system >	admin >	networking >	pick the WG121 >	add SSID etc

12:19	<CrippsFX>	zcat[1]  is the dapper channel now!
12:19	<Roger_The_Bum>	why the dvd instead of the CD
12:19	<tubbie>	dapper is out now?

12:20	<kayde>	tubbie, yes :)
12:20	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : doesnt feel like it, do i need a reboot like windows?
12:20	<hyphenated>	is there a link that describes the files a bit better? (eg: desktop, server, alternative) ?
12:20	<thoreauputic>	apokryphos: heh'
12:20	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, open up a terminal and type "ping -b www.google.ca"
12:20	<flodine>	i been running dapper from beta do i need to reinstall the final or just dist-upgrade
12:20	<crimsun>	In the Twenty-frist Century, we dislike reading the topic before we ask questions. We'd much rather have PONIES.
12:20	<gnuyen>	hrmm
12:20	<negsoul>	ow many megs wll it take to upgrade to new dapper?
12:20	<gnuyen>	since I don't want the "bleeding edge" version
12:20	<negsoul>	im using the rc
12:20	<gnuyen>	as much as the stable release
12:20	<kayde>	how do i upgrade to dapper in root?
12:20	<Roger_The_Bum>	OMG PONIES
12:20	<ajmitch_>	crimsun: surely not?
12:20	<aLd>	how do i update with update manager
12:20	<GazzaK>	Ponies - woo
12:20	<apokryphos>	kayde: /topic
12:20	<derfbugzi>	hyphenated, if you dont know what you want, chances are you want the desktop version
12:20	<tubbie>	 I don't have to reinstall. right? I have the flight 7 installed and updated everything
12:21	<GazzaK>	but I want a donkey
12:21	<Tomcat__>	PONIES!
12:21	<GazzaK>	donkey donkey donkey
12:21	<hyphenated>	derfbugzi: the description makes it sound like a live cd with an installer on it
12:21	<Tomcat__>	tubbie: Correct.
12:21	<Roger_The_Bum>	is there a reason that you would want the DVD?
12:21	<thoreauputic>	Zebras!
12:21	<GazzaK>	donkeys my friend
12:21	<ompaul>	jcz`, try logging out and doing ctrl-alt-f1 and log in and do this: sudo shutdown -h now<< if that fails try >-r <in place of >-h< when the machine starts to show signs of booting up hit and hold the power switch you should be safe enough - it would be better than your current situation anyway
12:21	<gnuyen>	is the only way to use update manager to upgrade to dapper by running it -d?
12:21	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : unknow host
12:21	<grimboy>	negsoul: It says it's taking me 36 hours.
12:21	<negsoul>	grimboy,  xi
12:22	<negsoul>	so better download a new cd?
12:22	<kayde>	kayde@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-base ubuntu-desktop

12:22	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : terminal = application >	accesories >	terminal , right?
12:22	<kayde>	help me...
12:22	<Almenfors>	can i update from breezy to dapper somehow?
12:22	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, okay. when you do "iwconfig" is there an "eth1" or a "wlan0" ?
12:22	<apokryphos>	kayde: (i) do not flood the channel (ii) you do not need ubuntu-base specified there
12:22	<rixxon>	how do i make files hidden?
12:22	<Tomcat__>	gnuyen: I read the update manager will tell you automatically... might not work yet though... maybe tomorrow.
12:22	<rixxon>	or folder
12:22	<apokryphos>	Almenfors: /topic
12:22	<grimboy>	!tell Almenfors about upgrade
12:22	<uccoffee_loves_B>	eth1
12:22	<ryanakca>	Flannel: or in 6.06 (Dapper Drake) you have the option of choosing to install a LAMP setup at the inital Ubuntu installation screen.             I never got one of those... and I take it the howto is for breezy?
12:22	<thoreauputic>	kayde: ubunt-desktop will pull in what you need
12:22	<gnuyen>	alright I'll wait
12:22	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : eth1
12:22	<gnuyen>	it's probably slow as hell now anyway
12:22	<apokryphos>	Almenfors: oh way, it was taken out :)
12:22	<Rambo3>	10 answers in one : rtfm (or wiki)
12:22	<hyphenated>	ah, here's the one that explains desktop,server,alternate https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2006-May/000140.html
12:22	<holden>	wrong link: http://releases.ubutnu.com/releases/6.06/ on http://www.ubuntu.com/download
12:22	<dooglus>	rixxon: in Linux files are hidden if their name begins with a dot
12:22	<thoreauputic>	kayde: * ubuntu-desktop
12:22	<kayde>	apokryphos, ...?
12:22	<threat>	has it been released yet?
12:22	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, okay. try "iwlist eth1 scan"
12:23	<Almenfors>	apokryphos, hehe
12:23	<ryanakca>	Flannel: its php4 :S
12:23	<ajmitch_>	ryanakca: LAMP option is for the server install cd
12:23	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : sorry, wth2
12:23	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : sorry, eth2
12:23	<onkarshinde>	Congratulations everyone.
12:23	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : sorry, eth2
12:23	<kayde>	thoreauputic, the whole code is?
12:23	<jcz`>	ompaul, ok
12:23	<Rambo3>	!tell Almenfors about upgrade
12:23	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, then replace "eth1" with "eth2"
12:23	<thoreauputic>	kayde:  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
12:23	<aLd>	running gksudo update-manager -d doesnt work for me
12:23	<K|NgGh0sT>	I installed nvidia drivers, and now it seems that my DPI is messed up, anyone know how to fix this?
12:23	<takedown_>	!easyubuntu
12:23	<apokryphos>	uccoffee_loves_B: no flooding please
12:23	<ubotu>	rumour has it, easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
12:23	<rixxon>	dooglus: what if i don't want to break the path
12:23	<cute_bettong>	ok um how do i order more than 8 cd;s of ubuntu at a time?
12:23	<apokryphos>	Almenfors: there :)
12:23	<thoreauputic>	kayde: that will pull in all the depenndencies for you
12:23	<bbrazil>	apokryphos: you've got upgarding twice
12:23	<cute_bettong>	i have a need for about 100 of the disks
12:23	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : where to type?
12:24	<kayde>	thoreauputic, sweet thanks mate
12:24	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, in the terminal
12:24	<cute_bettong>	must upgrade my clients XD
12:24	<apokryphos>	bbrazil: heh, dang, it was there
12:24	<nico>	HI ..Does the new dapper include xgl and compiz yet ??
12:24	<thoreauputic>	kayde: no worries :)
12:24	<linuxboy>	I just upgaded to dapper last night. I tried again, butthere are no updates...
12:24	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : app >	acc >	terminal , right?
12:24	<CrippsFX>	yes
12:24	<ompaul>	jcz`, you would be better asking the channel - I am doing other things and if I see it I can answer but I may not and you could be left sitting there
12:24	<CrippsFX>	uccoffee_loves_B, and leave the terminal open ;)
12:24	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : no scan results
12:24	<pekay>	how can I update my KDE to 3.5.3?
12:24	<CrippsFX>	damn.

12:25	<CrippsFX>	ajmitch_, I've been using dapper for a week and a half.

12:25	<ajmitch_>	CrippsFX: using it in my laptop now
12:25	<kbrooks>	takedown_: easyubuntu works on Dapper
12:25	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[CrippsFX] : any other thoughts?
12:25	<nico>	CrippsFX was that yes fot my question re xgl and compiz ??
12:25	<thoreauputic>	kayde: be specific
12:25	<dooglus>	apokryphos: that topic is unclear.  "USE THE ubuntu torrents DO NOT!!" is kind of a condradictory sentence
12:25	<CrippsFX>	ajmitch_, would you care to give uccoffee_loves_B a hand then?
12:25	<kayde>	thoreauputic, i would post what it says, but its to long..
12:25	<thoreauputic>	kayde: did you update first
12:26	<kayde>	thoreauputic, i pmd u

12:26	<pianoboy3333>	Are there any parental control programs for ubuntu?
12:26	<flodine>	is the repositories from the rc the same as the final release repos?
12:26	<ajmitch_>	uccoffee_loves_B: what wireless card/chipset are you using?
12:26	<zeR>	pianoboy3333: what do you mean by that?
12:26	<takedown_>	kbrooks: i know, i just need a link to easyubuntu
12:26	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[ajmitch_] : wg121

12:26	<apokryphos>	dooglus: well yes, it's not fully syntactically correct English; /me didn't put that, but hey.
12:26	<Chousuke>	I don't even have a CD to burn Ubuntu on. :/
12:26	<uccoffee_loves_B>	[ajmitch_] : i m reading http://www.ubuntuforums.org/search.php?searchid=5669296 . but dun understand what to do
12:26	<nico>	so i should add those one manually .. to get xgl and compiz working .. any plans for the future
12:27	<thoreauputic>	kayde: the channel is kind of busy right now :)
12:27	<ajmitch_>	uccoffee_loves_B: before trying iwlist, run sudo ifconfig eth2 up
12:27	<pianoboy3333>	zeR: like, programs that would block pr0n on a site...
12:27	<ajmitch_>	thoreauputic: just a little ;)

12:28	<ryanakca>	why is it that "Listen 80" in httpd.conf makes apache run on ipv6 instead of ipv4?
12:28	<thoreauputic>	kayde: should be...

12:31	<apokryphos>	nickm__: it's not only on dvd

12:31	<Roger_The_Bum>	rather than the normal Cd;s
12:31	<onkarshinde>	ThE-LiGhT: Yes it is. You don't need old kernel. Remember the old version is 2.6.12 while new one is 2.6.15
12:31	<apokryphos>	You can /msg the bot guys :)

12:32	<rackerz>	cheers.
12:32	<onkarshinde>	ThE-LiGhT: I though you already upgraded

12:32	<uccoffee_loves_B>	anyone know how to use ndiswrapper?
12:32	<Bols>	!DVD
12:32	<apokryphos>	nico: ok, then you'll want to upgrade from the CD, yup. You'll want the alternate
12:32	<ubotu>	DVD playing is possible in ubuntu. You may need libdvdcss2, which is available via http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages (section extras)
12:32	<ajmitch_>	derfbugzi: excuse me?
12:32	<nico>	but i don't mind re-installing at all ..
12:32	<Roger_The_Bum>	nickm__, type /topic
12:32	<martin__>	Hey, does anybody else experience problem with OOo icons inside the program dissapearing?
12:33	<apokryphos>	uccoffee_loves_B: /msg ubotu ndiswrapper
12:33	<Roger_The_Bum>	!install dvd
12:33	<ubotu>	Roger_The_Bum: Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
12:33	<nickm__>	just not all of the ISO's Roger_The_Bum
12:33	<derfbugzi>	ajmitch_, i meant rackerz
12:33	<onkarshinde>	flodine: Yes. 'Sudo apt-get update' and then 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
12:33	<jessy_>	somebody tried the DVD ? is this the version which can be used as an install cd or a live cd ??
12:33	<nico>	what would i need for xgl and compiz on Dapper ??
12:33	<apokryphos>	nico: if you want to reinstall then you can use desktop, sure.
12:33	<apokryphos>	jessy_: the DVD is desktop+alternate CD
12:33	<Spaceraver>	man... we need o split this chan to the release and general tech... too much is being said at one time...
12:33	<jcz`>	ompaul, by the way, i've already updated twice last week ... but it didnt seem to effect or solve my delayed login issue
12:33	<jessy_>	ok thanks
12:33	<Roger_The_Bum>	oh
12:33	<onkarshinde>	jessy_: both I guess
12:33	<Roger_The_Bum>	then it's just superfluous
12:33	<flodine>	onkarshin thxs very busy here i love it
12:33	<derfbugzi>	!alternate
12:33	<nickm__>	yeah, Roger_The_Bum, it may be available for download, just one DVD image or something, no use to most people :/
12:33	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with now Live session available.
12:34	<derfbugzi>	ahh
12:34	<rackerz>	1008 people :O
12:34	<jessy_>	ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso this one is the right ?
12:34	<apokryphos>	Roger_The_Bum: or it isn't, since it gives the option of both.
12:34	<rackerz>	jessy, yes.
12:34	<derfbugzi>	jessy_, yes
12:34	<onkarshinde>	jessy_: yes
12:34	<jessy_>	kk let's download it
12:34	<ThE-LiGhT>	onkarshinde, nah..
12:34	<ROBOd>	hello guys
12:34	<dooglus>	so the alternate CD is a bootable live CD as well as the desktop one?
12:34	<onkarshinde>	ThE-LiGhT: How much space do you have left in /  ?
12:34	<rackerz>	dooglus, yes :)
12:35	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: no
12:35	<ompaul>	jcz`, I am by no means a gnome expert, however if your telling me (as you have done already) that you don't have the word "options" on the bottom of the screen then I wonder if you are running dapper, it should be visible fromwhere you log in
12:35	<derfbugzi>	the seeds for the dvd just vanished :noes:
12:35	<apokryphos>	dooglus: no, re: alternate: /msg ubotu alternate
12:35	<dooglus>	dooglus: maybe
12:35	<Spaceraver>	looks like the first couple of users have the cd downloaded by now... more parts...
12:35	<zjimbo>	why are all the link on the Ubu download page 404-ing?
12:35	<thoreauputic>	rackerz: no the alternate istext mode
12:35	<onkarshinde>	dooglus: No. Desktop is Live CD. Alternate is install CD
12:35	<johan__>	whats up with the dvd
12:35	<ThE-LiGhT>	onkarshinde, 629 mb or so.. no /home
12:35	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: did you seen ubotu's factoid:
12:35	<dooglus>	!alternate
12:35	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with now Live session available.
12:35	<ompaul>	jcz`, in a terminal type: lsb_release -d : what does that tell you
12:35	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: yes, it has a typo
12:35	<apokryphos>	err, live cd available?
12:35	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: now should be "no"
12:36	<cef>	!ads
12:36	<ubotu>	Alternate = Old text-style installer, Desktop = LiveCD and graphical installer in one, Server = Server-class install (minimal)
12:36	<derfbugzi>	live cd is on all the cds as far as i understand
12:36	<Krpano>	anyone know what font is this ?... http://www.gnome-look.org/content/pre1/39316-1.png ...
12:36	<onkarshinde>	ThE-LiGhT: 629 should be sufficient don't you think? Did you try to update? Did it give error about insufficient space?
12:36	<derfbugzi>	sorry, not the alternate
12:36	<Spaceraver>	zjimbo... because every man/woman and their cat wants ubuntu right now...
12:36	<derfbugzi>	but the oters
12:36	<zjimbo>	lol
12:36	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
12:36	<ubotu>	alternate is, like, totally, The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no live session available.
12:36	<ThE-LiGhT>	onkarshinde, i'll check it... my friend needed 829 mb
12:36	<scheuri>	Spaceraver: well, and my dog and my grandma and...
12:37	<rackerz>	the text mode cd is bootable, i thought that was what he asked.
12:37	<rixth>	!install
12:37	<ubotu>	Installing Ubuntu? See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation Installing software on Ubuntu? See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingSoftware
12:37	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: I think thats right now
12:37	<Spaceraver>	ROFL scheuri
12:37	<ROBOd>	how to update to ubuntu 6.06 ?
12:37	<apokryphos>	thoreauputic: yup
12:37	<apokryphos>	ROBOd: /topic
12:37	<ROBOd>	without using the command line
12:37	<rixth>	ROBOd, best bet is to do a total reinstall.
12:37	<thoreauputic>	apokryphos: OK - just changed it :)
12:37	<Grunt>	BRB
12:37	<apokryphos>	rixth: no it's not
12:37	<scheuri>	...and each and everyone of them needs to download it themself...;)
12:37	<ROBOd>	rixth: why? :)
12:37	<onkarshinde>	ThE-LiGhT: That depend on what all packages you have already installed. May be your friend installed mroe packages form repos.
12:37	<Spaceraver>	ROBOd... use apt-get dist-upgrade or dl the cd...
12:37	<apokryphos>	ROBOd: it isn't; a proper upgrade from stable ->	stable is fully supported
12:38	<jcz`>	ompaul, well, it says 'welcome to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS - Dapper Drake june 2006'
12:38	<zjimbo>	it's odd - I started downloading a while ago from releases.ubuntu.com and the speed hasn't dropped.
12:38	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: can you get him to miss out the "alternate is", like it did before?
12:38	<ROBOd>	Spaceraver: shall i download the livecd or the "normal" cd?
12:38	<rixth>	apokryphos, yeah, it kinda it for me anyway. All these updates have left orphaned files all over my filesystem, some functions such as auto-mounting of my camera don't work any more etc.
12:38	<ROBOd>	does the livecd allow me to upgrade?
12:38	<Roger_The_Bum>	yes
12:38	<apokryphos>	dooglus: yes, use x is <reply>	somemessage   syntax
12:38	<ROBOd>	i suppose you guys have new repositories and such, for dapper
12:38	<Roger_The_Bum>	there is no live cd anymore
12:38	<thoreauputic>	apokryphos: of course if you want to be pedantic, it should be called "alternative" but whatever,
12:38	<apokryphos>	rixth: well, time to report bugs :)
12:38	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: I'll have another go
12:38	<dooglus>	ROBOd: the choice is desktop or alternate.  you want desktop
12:38	<Roger_The_Bum>	just the "desktop" cd
12:38	<apokryphos>	thoreauputic: that's soo altnerative oh my gosh
12:38	<siccness>	apokryphos, like what bugs?
12:38	<onkarshinde>	Roger_The_Bum: Yes there is. Only it has been renamed to Desktop CD
12:39	<rixth>	" The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer" does that mean 6.06 has a graphical installer?
12:39	<Roger_The_Bum>	and it has an installer
12:39	<apokryphos>	siccness: there aren't really many. Dapper is technically stable
12:39	<Roger_The_Bum>	rixth, yep
12:39	<ROBOd>	dooglus: so, i'll download desktop and it will nicely upgrade my stable ubuntu?
12:39	<apokryphos>	of course some bugs still slip through
12:39	<thoreauputic>	apokryphos: :)
12:39	<Cas>	!tell ROBOd about upgrade
12:39	<rixth>	Sweet! I can't wait 14 more minutes.
12:39	<siccness>	apokryphos, as expected though.
12:39	<apokryphos>	indeed
12:39	<dooglus>	apokryphos: there are over 10,000 open bugs against dapper aren't there?
12:39	<siccness>	I was just curious to know if there were any major flaws
12:39	<ROBOd>	Cas: i already so that, and i ain't liking that
12:39	<Spaceraver>	woot... now we might get a better rating at the sistro beginners shootout...
12:39	<jcz`>	ompaul, when i click on system- about ubuntu
12:39	<apokryphos>	dooglus: don't know
12:40	<rixth>	I'm getting 90kb/sec from releases.ubuntu.com. (I can max at 255kb/sec)
12:40	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
12:40	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no Live session available on it.
12:40	<Cas>	ROBOd: you mean the updatemanager -d ? what is the problem?
12:40	<thoreauputic>	OK
12:40	<bionic>	ubuntu-6.06-dvd-amd64.iso, is this the final dapper release for amd64?
12:40	<zjimbo>	Flaws? like yast in Suse?
12:40	<apokryphos>	rixth: torrents might be better now
12:40	<apokryphos>	zjimbo: yast is a flaw in suse?
12:40	<apokryphos>	erm...
12:40	<asc>	rixth: try the torrent, I'm getting 206 of 256
12:40	<rixth>	apecat, only 15 minutes left, may as well just let it finish
12:40	<dooglus>	apokryphos: did you see this?  http://launchpad.net/bugs/47195 :)
12:40	<asc>	*KB
12:40	<rixth>	Eeeeee! Now it is 33.
12:40	<apokryphos>	zjimbo: flaws of Ubuntu? Not BiArch compatible, not really as much polish IMO as some other distros.
12:41	<ROBOd>	Cas: i also want to have ubuntu 6.06 on my local disk, so i'll be able to do clean installs myself, if needed, without redownloading
12:41	<bigfoot1>	1 month ago i upgraded from breezy to dapper beta .should i do anytthing today to go to non-beta dapper, or is it already on my system (via the daily software-updates)?
12:41	<rixth>	Can I start the correct against the semi downloaded ISO?
12:41	<rixth>	the torrent, rather
12:41	<halibut>	6.06 LTS,  LTS = ?  is this the release I want?
12:41	<rixth>	halibut, yep
12:41	<rsk>	halibut: yes
12:41	<rixth>	halibut, LTS = long ter spport
12:41	<rackerz>	LTS = Long Term Support rite?
12:41	<rackerz>	guess so.
12:41	<Fillado>	Rixth: yeah
12:41	<apokryphos>	dooglus: nope, I don't think that means much at all.
12:41	<morten__>	is the alternate iso additional packages? from dapper 6.06?
12:42	<negsoul>	is wpa working ok now?
12:42	<apokryphos>	morten__: /msg ubotu alternate
12:42	<ROBOd>	thanks guys
12:42	<ROBOd>	gotta go, bye
12:42	<halibut>	I have a 64bit amd processor, should I get the 64bit ubuntu, I have heard a lot of comments like "64 bit is not ready for prime time yet" etc

12:42	<r4zz>	http://www.ubuntu.com/download
12:42	<kayde>	thoreauputic, none of the options work...it wont let me downlod ANY of tthe way for daapper
12:43	<Cas>	ROBOd: i really don't understand you, if you now run breezy and want to update do it with the update-manager -d, if you want to install it on on a new pc download the cd,
12:43	<eXistenZ>	Is there a DVD version?
12:43	<berrum>	Fillado, hehe, already done that!
12:43	<Lukketto>	stephane: apt-get
12:43	<petrik>	I heard that if you have a second drive even if you don't ask it to touch it it will ruin it anyhow. Is there any thruth to that?
12:43	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: yes, but I believe it's still synching on the mirrors
12:43	<thoreauputic>	kayde: be specific - what errors are you getting ?
12:43	<rackerz>	wow my download speed on torrents is kicking butt.
12:43	<petrik>	6.06 that is
12:43	<Fillado>	Berrum: isn't it a Mass Storage Device?
12:43	<Cas>	petrik: no
12:43	<halibut>	petrik, nonsense
12:43	<PeanutHorst>	berrum: yup
12:43	<derfbugzi>	there are no seeders for the dvd at the moment :(
12:43	<petrik>	thank goodness for that
12:43	<raquel>	hola
12:43	<kayde>	thoreauputic, update manager, nothing, says my pc is up to daate...
12:43	<stephane>	yeah, apt get dapper drake?? doesnt work
12:43	<PeanutHorst>	mount it like  a USB disk
12:44	<morten__>	can anyone tell what the alternate iso is for?
12:44	<PeanutHorst>	adios, ubuntu users!
12:44	<thoreauputic>	kayde: did you read and follow the URL I gave you?
12:44	<Cas>	!tell stephane about upgrade

12:44	<apokryphos>	morten__: /msg ubotu alternate

12:44	<protocol1>	ahahha office space is funnier than crap
12:44	<Fillado>	than 192MB
12:44	<kayde>	thoreauputic, tried all the options
12:44	<petrik>	It's the 120GB drive I still need to tidy up and that I have not been able to get my two machines talking to each other for.
12:44	<thoreauputic>	kayde: you are doing something wrong :)
12:44	<kayde>	thoreauputic, yes :S
12:44	<raquel>	q pasa?
12:44	<petrik>	Hope networking is easier with 6.06
12:44	<thoreauputic>	kayde: it works fine if you do all the steps
12:44	<Fillado>	Morten: Read http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/

12:44	<protocol1>	hahaha
12:44	<halibut>	will I be able to get nvidia drivers under 64 bit? will I be able to run 32 bit software as normal without running as root or something??
12:45	<dooglus>	morten__: the alternate install CD is for special cases (OEM, automation, LVM, RAID, etc.)
12:45	<[zero] >	How do I update?
12:45	<Cas>	Lukketto: update-manager -d is much more easier ;)
12:45	<protocol1>	hyphenated, looks like your having a bad case of the monday's
12:45	<apokryphos>	halibut: nvidia: yes; 32-bit software: as a general: no, ubuntu/debian is not biarch

12:45	<halibut>	apokryphos, will I have significantly faster boot times?
12:45	<Cas>	halibut: here is is a little but also uses more memory
12:45	<apokryphos>	halibut: faster ish
12:45	<Lukketto>	Cas: much more ;) You can use system->admin->update ;)

12:46	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: I was just quoting from https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2006-May/000140.html
12:46	<kerb>	whats up with the tracker?
12:46	<Spaceraver>	cant handle the traffic
12:46	<Pecisk>	seems so
12:46	<Lukketto>	stephane: did you copy it?
12:46	<hyphenated>	protocol1: Well, I generally come in about 15 minutes late, I use the side door.. (can't remember the rest)
12:46	<kerb>	lol, just when I got a 25mbit server up to seed :)
12:46	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: fair enough ;) But the alternate CD should work better on low-memory machines for standard installs too :)
12:46	<reiki>	ubuntu+1 is invite only? (I just woke up)
12:47	<kerb>	reiki: closed until edgy opens
12:47	<Frogzoo>	is Dapper in da house?
12:47	<ThE-LiGhT>	onkarshinde, ok
12:47	<reiki>	kerb: ahh
12:47	<ThE-LiGhT>	Frogzoo, yeah!!
12:47	<protocol1>	hyphenated, and I sit at my desk and stare at nothing for about an hour!
12:47	<Spaceraver>	Frogzoo... look at the topic
12:47	<protocol1>	lol
12:47	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: I seem to recall seeing a discussion on ubuntu-devel list about problems with the desktop CD on low memory systems
12:47	<Frogzoo>	ThE-LiGhT: SHWEET!!
12:47	<petrik>	Just realised last CD I burned was on windoze. Now I have no more windoze this will be a test to see if breezy has CD writing set up correctly on this machine
12:48	<Corey>	woah
12:48	<hyphenated>	protocol1: last time I watched it, I laughed extra hard seeing Dr Cox (from Scrubs) as one of the Bob's
12:48	<Corey>	its really released !?
12:48	<ska-fan>	Which disk do I need when I want to upgrade from breezy and do have network access but want to take as much packages as possible from the disk?
12:48	<thoreauputic>	Corey: indeed
12:48	<zjimbo>	hm cancel at 12% to dump cd for dvd or keep going...
12:48	<Corey>	How can I upgrade from my current dapper installastion
12:48	<ska-fan>	traffic costs here
12:48	<thoreauputic>	ska-fan: alternate
12:48	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
12:48	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no Live session available on it.
12:48	<berrum>	Fillado, i dont know it is a mass storage device
12:48	<thoreauputic>	ska-fan: it has more packages on  it
12:49	<r4zz>	is the dvd worth waiting for?
12:49	<thoreauputic>	ska-fan: add it to synaptic or use apt-cdrom add
12:49	<ska-fan>	thoreauputic: ok. the old install cd is the new alternate cd?
12:49	<Spaceraver>	zjimbo... what would you need the dvd ver for... packages will become old fast
12:49	<dooglus>	r4zz: no

12:49	<Corey>	Guys how do I update to dapper from my current dapper which I downlaoded 4 days ago
12:49	<berrum>	Fillado, its a digital ixus 700
12:49	<Healot>	the Desktop CD is like the LiveCD with installer option :-)
12:49	<thoreauputic>	ska-fan: no problem :)
12:49	<r4zz>	k... so http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso.torrent is the one I want right?
12:49	<ska-fan>	:)
12:50	<Frogzoo>	Corey: sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
12:50	<kayde>	thoreauputic, the one that involves pastebin, might work, how do i do it? what do i doo with that weird stuff?
12:50	<protocol1>	hyphenated, hahah peter gets promoted for blowing off
12:50	<Healot>	if you need LVM/RAID support, low RAM, customization, take the alternate-CD
12:50	<Frogzoo>	Corey: you may need to change your repos - not sure
12:50	<thoreauputic>	kayde: huh? I don't follow you ...
12:50	<Corey>	guys nothing updated
12:51	<thoreauputic>	kayde: I suggest you caome back when the channel is a bit less busy in a day or so :)

12:56	<thoreauputic>	Things are slowing down - we are below 1000 people now *grin*
12:56	<Sampizcat>	I'm having trouble with 6.06 and setting up RAID - I've managed to configure the software raid (raid is disabled in BIOS) and it's formatted the partitions (by the looks of things), but now it's just gone to a blue screen, and noing else is happening
12:56	<jcz`>	not in the last day or two
12:56	<negsoul>	jcz`, to the new release today?

12:58	<thoreauputic>	!ubuntuguide
12:58	<ubotu>	[ubuntuguide]  badly out of date,  reported to break a lot and generally a bad source for information. Use help.ubuntu.com or wiki.ubuntu.com instead.

12:58	<leks>	:)
12:58	<thoreauputic>	leks: that's debian, this is ubuntu :)

01:01	<Sampizcat>	ThE-LiGhT:  just do a search for deb's and rpm's that you don't need
01:01	<rixth>	Edgy Eft should be the name of the unstable. 'Edgy' is not a good adjective
01:01	<zjimbo>	do you have a girl-dar
01:01	<cef>	Zap42: they're being held back
01:01	<rukuartic>	assasukasse: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto I think

01:02	<venkatachar>	can anyone tell me what is the procedure to do dist-upgrade to 6.06
01:02	<Bilford>	sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

01:02	<thoreauputic>	guys, #ubuntu-offtopic for general chatter please
01:02	<jcz`>	zjimbo, wat u think ??
01:02	<apokryphos>	negsoul: geez; language, please.
01:02	<rukuartic>	Question: I just ran update/dist-upgrade and it only added one package. Was I just extremely up to date?
01:03	<jcz`>	sex + shopping
01:03	<venkatachar>	should i modify the sources.list?
01:03	<jcz`>	ofcourse
01:03	<Frogzoo>	!upgrade
01:03	<ubotu>	from memory, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
01:03	<assasukasse>	This page does not exist yet.This page does not exist yet.
01:03	<apokryphos>	jcz`: stop
01:03	<negsoul>	apokryphos, i was just going directly to my way of thinking :X
01:03	<y2d2>	the sudo apt0get dist-upgrade just says im upgraded
01:03	<leks>	I WANT EDGY
01:03	<leks>	:'(
01:03	<IB->	will ubuntu 6.06 run normally on a 500mhz computer ?
01:03	<apokryphos>	negsoul: that doesn't make it okay :)
01:03	<rsk>	IB-: what do you mean normally?
01:03	<Chousuke>	Do they yet have Apple powerbook suspend support on Dapper?
01:03	<IB->	rsk: fast enough..
01:03	<IB->	responsive enough
01:03	<Cas>	!tell assasukasse about xgl
01:03	<Chousuke>	it didn't work on breezy.
01:03	<rsk>	IB-: probably not
01:03	<IB->	k
01:03	<negsoul>	thoreauputic, ->	an op?
01:03	<negsoul>	:p
01:04	<fr3drik>	Is the torrent.ubuntu.com-tracker down?
01:04	<thoreauputic>	Chousuke: don't know -suspend works on iBook
01:04	<venkatachar>	should i modify the sources.list to upgrade to 6.06?
01:04	<dabaR>	Chousuke: yes.
01:04	<negsoul>	Chousuke, it doesnt for a tsunami neither
01:04	<Zap42>	IB-: if you dont have enough ram performance will depend on the speed of your disks
01:04	<apokryphos>	venkatachar: /topic
01:04	<thoreauputic>	negsoul: looks like it, doesn't it ?
01:04	<Chousuke>	dabaR: Are you sure?
01:04	<IB->	http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/ doesnt work
01:04	<LinuxJones>	Even the Torrents are down
01:04	<dabaR>	Chousuke: you mean to make it go to sleep/
01:04	<rixth>	What version of PHP does the LAMP have?
01:04	<IB->	Zap42: 128mb is prolyl not enough...
01:04	<Verithrax>	IB-, if you don't try to run Gnome, and instead run a lightweight WM, or tone down Gnome's eye-candy a lot, it might.
01:04	<bionic>	Im sorry to ask again, but ubuntu-6.06-dvd-amd64.iso, is this the final FULL dapper release for amd64? Thanks
01:04	<Chousuke>	dabaR: yeah.
01:04	<negsoul>	thoreauputic, just saw you removing it now
01:04	<shriphani>	guys where do i find the bittorrent meta file ?
01:04	<apokryphos>	bionic: yes
01:04	<Zap42>	IB-: yupp
01:05	<rukuartic>	IB-: you might like xubuntu, it runs xfce which is a lighter interface
01:05	<IB->	i've got a 64bit cpu, should i go on ubuntu 64 or 32 ?
01:05	<venkatachar>	 /msg ubotu upgrade
01:05	<Chousuke>	dabaR: I have a 1.33GHz powerbook.
01:05	<LinuxJones>	shriphani, they don't seem to work atm
01:05	<apokryphos>	Does anyone have the torrent files available? I could host them temporarily
01:05	<rob>	gee the au mirror is a bit slow atm :)
01:05	<bionic>	apokryphos: appreciate it, thanks..
01:05	<dabaR>	Chousuke: yep, has been working for a while. Dunno whether they still have the right option in the shutdown menu, though. I have one right here too, talking to you from it. the newest powerbook.
01:05	<thoreauputic>	rob: use the torrents
01:05	<assasukasse>	!xgl
01:05	<ubotu>	I heard xgl is "XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/"
01:05	<rixth>	I will be seeding overnight.
01:05	<IB->	what are the drawbacks to using ubuntu 64 ?
01:05	<IB->	flash ? java ?
01:05	<zjimbo>	:-p I didn't know sexist stereotyping was allowed here...
01:05	<Chousuke>	dabaR: My powerbook isn't the newest one.
01:05	<rob>	thoreauputic, nah, I already have dapper installed, just updating
01:05	<ajmitch_>	IB-: pretty much just those two
01:05	<rixth>	IB- and w32codecs
01:06	<thoreauputic>	rob: then seed the torrent :)
01:06	<Chousuke>	dabaR: did your suspend work on breezy too?
01:06	<IB->	and there isnt 32 emulation libs for them ?
01:06	<rixth>	Oh thats right, sorry.

01:06	<dabaR>	Chousuke: heard of a live CD? aka desktop CD? you could use it to test. No it did not work in breezy
01:06	<apokryphos>	IB-: no, but you can make a chroot
01:06	<thoreauputic>	rob: if you  have an ISO of course
01:06	<rob>	I will probably soon
01:06	<Chousuke>	dabaR: hmmh.
01:06	<apokryphos>	unfortunately Ubuntu is not BiArch compatible [yet] 
01:06	<IB->	so i guess for now i'll stick with 32 bit ver

01:08	<McNutella>	can I update using "software updates" GUI ?
01:08	<y2d2>	it says im up to date

01:09	<souljas>	Chousuke: yes

01:09	<y2d2>	i used sudo apt-get update and upgrade
01:09	<Chousuke>	souljas: excellent
01:09	<McNutella>	needs the . taken outta that message
01:09	<y2d2>	my teminals say brezy badger
01:09	<dabaR>	Chousuke: works, however, still buggy, and I have come to a point where I will only use the drivers on a separate partition than my production one.
01:09	<rsk>	McNutella: it does
01:09	<souljas>	Chousuke:  also has a alternative cd for low memory machines and the such
01:09	<Chousuke>	dabaR: alright.
01:10	<Bilford>	y2d2, just replace all breezy with dapper in your source list
01:10	<McNutella>	ubotu has the . on the url link, that will take one to a page not in existance
01:10	<apokryphos>	y2d2: /msg ubotu upgrade for other methods
01:10	<ubotu>	I'm sorry, i don't know what you're talking about, McNutella
01:10	<dabaR>	Chousuke: however, my card is slightly diff from yours, afaik, so you may have better luck.
01:10	<stylus>	Err, how do I get all that graphical interface happening? It has nothing but a command prompt.
01:10	<Chousuke>	souljas: my machine has plenty of memory. 1.25GB ;)
01:10	<apokryphos>	Bilford, y2d2: there's a bit more to it than that. See /msg ubotu upgrade

01:11	<dabaR>	Chousuke: ya, very slick OS.

01:11	<Chousuke>	dabaR: on x86 machines I'd have Ubuntu, but since I can run OS X on my powerbook, I don't have a real need for Ubuntu :)
01:11	<TheMadman>	anyone had success running k8v 64 bit motherboard with ATI graphics?
01:11	<dabaR>	dooglus: right click on the .iso file, and the menu will appear. then click the burn to disc option, and watch it work its magic.
01:11	<rukuartic>	apokryphos: I just ran both update/dist-upgrade and update-manager -d from dapper beta. If it doesn't upgrade much, am I using 6.06 final release?
01:12	<no0ke>	so dapper drake is now 'stable' ?
01:12	<IB->	welp laters
01:12	<chmod775>	phew
01:12	<dabaR>	Chousuke: you must be either good with OSX, or just not use computers that much
01:12	<apokryphos>	rukuartic: which beta specifically? As in, when was the last time you upgraded?
01:12	<apokryphos>	no0ke: yes
01:12	<GNAM>	there are 3 dapper-dvd-i386.iso... what's kubuntu one?

01:13	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: the right-click to burn is a nautilus thing

01:14	<dabaR>	dooglus: but, ask: How do I burn isos to a CD without nautilus?
01:14	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: yes, that's how I burned the breezy cd I think

01:15	<ubotu>	well, lts is Long Term Support. LTS versions will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
01:15	<apokryphos>	cy_: no, you'll likely encounter many problems. Upgrade from debian ->	ubuntu is not supported at all; you'll need to do a full reinstall.

01:28	<rixth>	"The reference implementation of the Java programming language from Sun Microsystems (Although this will be available in Ubuntu Dapper due to license changes.)" from Wikipedia. Will Dapper have Sun's Java by default?
01:28	<marmite>	so dapper-desktop-i386.iso is the livecd and installer in one?
01:28	<rukuartic>	So dapper server comes with a lamp install? That PHP or Perl?
01:28	<rukuartic>	marmite: yep ^^
01:28	<apokryphos>	marmite: yes
01:28	<marmite>	sweet
01:28	<Seveas>	Tidus, done that weeks ago...
01:28	<LinuxJones>	sduffy, if that't the x86 live cd could you post the .torrent so I can seed it ?
01:28	<dholbach>	rixth: no, not by default.
01:28	<thoreauputic>	rixth: not by default - but it's available in multiverse
01:28	<zjimbo>	how is xgl/compiz
01:28	<capitanplaneta>	is there an estimate on the number of ubuntu users, worldwide?
01:29	<rukuartic>	zjimbo: cool, and memory/processor hogging
01:29	<apokryphos>	zjimbo: /msg ubotu xgl
01:29	<rixth>	Ah okay. Also, in reference to rukuartic, is the LAMP PHP or Python or Perl? What versions?
01:29	<rixth>	!package malp
01:29	<ubotu>	Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, rixth
01:29	<cef>	not too bad.. according to the tracker, there's been 155 GiB downloaded
01:29	<rixth>	!package lamp
01:29	<ubotu>	rixth: No idea, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
01:29	<sybariten>	one question though, i screwed up my locale settings - or whatever i should call the keyboard settings in this case, seems global for gnome and xfce anyhow - to the point where i cant use my swedish special characters. On the DamnSmall liveCD for instance, i start up with US keyboard each time and i exit X and do 'loadkeys se-latin1' and reenter X ....  on this box i couldnt do that now, from a terminal. Any ideas where i should change t
01:29	<Fujitsu>	!info lamp
01:29	<lilo>	congrats, all :)
01:29	<Seveas>	thanks lilo
01:29	<neutrinomass>	capitanplaneta: None that I know of...according to distrowatch it's the most popular distro....
01:29	<zjimbo>	;-p fattening... the way I like it
01:29	<apokryphos>	thanks =)
01:29	<Seveas>	lilo, look at the number of users
01:29	<thoreauputic>	lilo: :)
01:29	<lilo>	Seveas: yep :)
01:30	<Fujitsu>	1004...
01:30	<lilo>	Seveas: knew it had to happen :)
01:30	<Fujitsu>	A record, I believe?
01:30	<Seveas>	we beat #debian and in the same sweep took over the lead from #gentoo 
01:30	<rixth>	lilo, we're bigger than #gentoo =D
01:30	<sybariten>	rukuartic: ok, i doubt i will switch back though... we'll see
01:30	<Fujitsu>	Nice!
01:30	<apokryphos>	lilo: is there an all-time record?
01:30	<thoreauputic>	it was up to 1024 a while ago :)
01:30	<dyn>	hi all :)
01:30	<ukh>	well, #debian is leaving for OFTC anyway
01:30	<Reg|ster>	how can i update from 5.10 to 6.06??
01:30	<lilo>	Fujitsu: I believe this is the first time that you guys have been #1.... it's not unexpected, but it's pretty cool :)
01:30	<apokryphos>	yeah
01:30	<grimboy>	!lamp
01:30	<lilo>	I'm actually not sure what the record is
01:30	<apokryphos>	Reg|ster: /topic
01:30	<lilo>	but this is a record :)
01:30	<apokryphos>	yeah :)
01:30	<lilo>	ukh: I don't think they've been #1 for a while
01:31	<rukuartic>	lilo: are the logs mirrored somewhere? maybe someone could write a tidy perl script >>;
01:31	<rata>	dabaR, sorry, if you answer me i dont read you. Could you repeat which packages do you refer to ?
01:31	<apokryphos>	rukuartic: logs for this channel?
01:31	<rukuartic>	apokryphos: yep
01:31	<dyn>	i'm doing a clean install of 6.06.. approximately how long should it take to resize a 80Gb NTFS to 60Gb? it's been working for half an hour now and I'm slightly worried..
01:31	<rob>	!logs
01:31	<ubotu>	logs are at http://people.ubuntu.com/~fabbione/irclogs/
01:31	<apokryphos>	rukuartic: /msg ubotu logs
01:31	<tubbie>	any one here have win xp installing using qemu?
01:31	<rob>	dam
01:31	<sybariten>	i believe in gnome you have a special setting for keyboard layouts and such ?  does xfce have something similar?
01:31	<rixth>	dyn, NTFS?
01:31	<tubbie>	installed*
01:31	<dabaR>	rata: I forgot what we were talking about
01:31	<dyn>	rixth: yeah to make some space on the hard dirve
01:31	<Fillado>	dyn: takes qtparted like a minute
01:31	<rixth>	dyn, I don't think Ubuntu has write support for NTFS.
01:31	<rukuartic>	apokryphos: Logs are rolling down the hill :P
01:31	<Fujitsu>	dyn, it could take a while if there are a lot of files.
01:32	<Fujitsu>	rixth, it can resize.
01:32	<lilo>	anyway, very neat :)
01:32	<Fillado>	unless your partiton is fragmented
01:32	<rata>	dabaR, :). I am triying to change locales for a server in dapper
01:32	<rixth>	Resizing is freaking scary.
01:32	<jadaz87>	does anyone know of a linux program that can modify fla or flash files?
01:32	<_nano_>	dyn: i think if the drive is fragmented it might take a while
01:32	<dyn>	Fujitsu: there's over 40G data on the ntfs
01:32	<dyn>	_nano_: so over 30 mins can be ok?
01:32	<dabaR>	rata: Oh. I am not sure, that is why I did not send any msgs
01:32	<capitanplaneta>	and the number of gnu/linux users worldwide?
01:32	<rukuartic>	I tried to resize my ntfs. It broke on the 6th try... Oh no...
01:32	<Fillado>	dyn: when did you last defrag it?
01:32	<livingdaylight>	is Dapper Official yet?
01:32	<Frogzoo>	tubbie: aye
01:32	<Seveas>	livingdaylight, yes
01:32	<Fillado>	yes livingdaylight
01:32	<rukuartic>	capitanplaneta: too many to count :P Lots of sysadmins/servers use linux
01:32	<siccness>	Yes livingdaylight
01:33	<dyn>	Fillado: it's the collegue's machine.. I think never is the right answer :)
01:33	<cached>	im connected to 3 seeds and 31 peers but im getting 435B/sec
01:33	<livingdaylight>	YeeeehaaaAAHH!!!
01:33	<tubbie>	Frogzoo, do you have sound working?
01:33	<capitanplaneta>	:)
01:33	<dyn>	Fillado: still, partman can do its job fine, nah?
01:33	<rata>	dabaR, ohh, dont care about it, lie me that i like it ;)
01:33	<Fillado>	yeah, just take quite a bit moving all the files forwad on the disc :)
01:33	<Frogzoo>	tubbie: haven't bothered to be honest
01:33	<jadaz87>	why does ubuntu+1 not exist??
01:33	<capitanplaneta>	i'm getting 230 Kbps on gnome bittorrent
01:33	<dyn>	Fillado: and also, at 'ps aux' I can see only 2 partman processes running, no ntfsresize..
01:34	<livingdaylight>	ok, GUYS!, how do i upgrade from Breezy then?
01:34	<Frogzoo>	tubbie: you _might_ do better with 0.8
01:34	<Fillado>	hmm
01:34	<Fujitsu>	jadaz87, there is no Ubuntu+1 at the moment.
01:34	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, see /topic.
01:34	<IB->	where is a list that says the diff ebtween all the stuff at http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/ ?
01:34	<SunTzuTech>	livingdaylight: it's in the wiki
01:34	<Fillado>	personally i use system rescue cd + qt parted
01:34	<grimboy>	Hey, has anyone every tried to implement apt-get on top of bittorrent?
01:34	<rukuartic>	Any tutorials around on networkmanager?
01:34	<cached>	finally, down speed increasing
01:34	<dooglus>	it will be interesting to see whether that bug which resulted in ntfs partitions getting trashed really got fixed or not
01:34	<cached>	<3 ubuntu
01:34	<rukuartic>	dooglus: I ran into that
01:35	<IB->	ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso is what i need ?
01:35	<Fillado>	yes IB-
01:35	<dodgyvile>	hello again
01:35	<jadaz87>	does anyone know of a linux program that can modify fla or flash files?
01:35	<dodgyvile>	I just upgraded to dapper and there a few problems! 1. The internet connection keeps dropping out. It runs fine for maybe 5 mins and then just drops out. After a little while it reconnects again. Even now I think it may have dropped out. D'Oh
01:35	<dyn>	Fillado: so you do not recommend the 6.06 livecd's built in resize solution?
01:35	<livingdaylight>	Ok, GUYS, THX. Today is a very important day!
01:35	<QPAD|warlock>	How do I run a application trough shell_exec and save the PID?
01:35	<pedrocr>	update-manager should have the dapper upgrade availabe as soon as my mirror updates, right?
01:35	<Frogzoo>	6 hours - 16 hours - 10 hours - it's like watching dials on a slot machine
01:35	<dooglus>	rukuartic: not with the final release though?
01:35	<zbyte>	3.5
01:35	<rukuartic>	dooglus: no it was a beta.
01:35	<thoreauputic>	dodgyvile: yup, I didn't see your post saying that you had dropped out ;)
01:35	<Fillado>	well, i've never actually used it, i just use system rescue cd to resize the disk, then all i need to select is use the largest bit of free space
01:35	<dodgyvile>	All my connections (http, irc, bittorrent) just drop to zero
01:36	<livingdaylight>	This day will go down in the anals of history as one of the most important days in the evolution of mankind  :)
01:36	<IB->	tnx
01:36	<Fillado>	less chance of screwing something up ;)
01:36	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: what are you doing?
01:36	<baby>	when i try to configure any file it gives an error like "C Compiler cannot create executables" how can i fix it?
01:36	<amac>	the servers are dead
01:36	<dodgyvile>	thoreauputic: I had to reconnect to irc.freenode.org :(
01:36	<amac>	heh
01:36	<Frogzoo>	dooglus: ->	dapper
01:36	<dyn>	Fillado: i see your point :)
01:36	<rukuartic>	Frogzoo: If i had an actual 6.06 iso I'd put it up just for you. But I don't cuz I'm scared to tip the fragile ballance of bandwidth
01:36	<DeanStl>	evolution?
01:36	<grimboy>	I've just ran out of disk space when upgrading
01:36	<QPAD|warlock>	Anyone know how to run a application trough shell_exec and save the PID? <- ?
01:36	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: updating?  or downloading a .iso?
01:36	<scheuri>	livingdaylight: mark, is it you?
01:36	<Cas>	jadaz87: there is f4l(flash4linux) but i wouldn't recommend that
01:36	<thoreauputic>	livingdaylight: erm, slight exaggeration perhaps ;)
01:36	<livingdaylight>	scheuri: no, conrad
01:36	<Frogzoo>	dooglus: yep - updating - now I see my mistake, *sigh*
01:36	<blastmanu>	bonjour
01:36	<LinuxJones>	WTF there are over 1000 people in here :D
01:36	<rukuartic>	QPAD|warlock: Eeh... if you run the app and then ps aux | grep (ap name)
01:36	<Dkt>	Do Ubuntu have an inbuilt FTP-Program? (A client) In that case, which?
01:36	<Frogzoo>	LinuxJones: dapper's released today
01:36	<jadaz87>	Cas: why whould you not recommend it? lol
01:36] !lilo:*! Congratulations to Ubuntu on Dapper Day!
01:36	<jadaz87>	!dapper
01:36	<ubotu>	DAPPER IS OUT! PARTY TIME! https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html
01:37	<dyn>	LinuxJones: it's a great day today, no wonder :)
01:37	<livingdaylight>	thoreauputic: nah...common!!!  ;)
01:37	<scheuri>	Dkt: gFTP
01:37	<LinuxJones>	I am loving it
01:37	<thoreauputic>	livingdaylight: heheh
01:37	<jadaz87>	wow
01:37	<grimboy>	jadaz87: Try running the real thing but with wine or crossover office
01:37	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: you'll probably find it's quicker to download the .iso, mount the image, and add the mountpoint as a repository, then update...
01:37	<jadaz87>	Dapper add 300 proplr
01:37	<dodgyvile>	When I first upgraded to dapper, the network icon in the top tray appeared to be a broken wireless connection (this comp's never had wireless) as opposed to a normal ADSL connection that was there before...
01:37	<dodgyvile>	congrats btw
01:37	<Cas>	Dkt: places->connect to server
01:37	<kbrooks>	dooglus: cool, eh?
01:37	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: the torrent was blazing - I was getting 450Kb/s for the last 20 minutes
01:37	<Sanne>	Dkt, if you use Kubuntu, you can use the konqueror filemanager as ftp client.
01:37	<_nano_>	how does dapper final treat broadcom wireless cards?
01:37	<tubbie>	 -
01:37	<livingdaylight>	ubuntu have changed their homepage
01:38	<Mulder>	_nano_, probably still out of luck
01:38	<tubbie>	\.
01:38	<livingdaylight>	www.ubuntu.com looks different now
01:38	<rukuartic>	Yeah I thought dapper was out in like, two/three months. Why'd it get released so early?
01:38	<Frogzoo>	dooglus: I know I know - but didn't realise the update would be so slow b4 I kicked it off :P
01:38	<kbrooks>	livingdaylight: WE KNOW
01:38	<jadaz87>	livingdaylight: it is REALLY nice
01:38	<dodgyvile>	I hate to be a party-pooper but this is really frustrating to me
01:38	<kbrooks>	livingdaylight: WE KNOW
01:38	<thoreauputic>	_nano_: you'll need the firmware
01:38	<livingdaylight>	GUYS, i only just realized! wow!
01:38	<rukuartic>	dodgyvile: whats gettin ya down?
01:38	<thoreauputic>	_nano_: see the wiki pages on wifi
01:38	<QPAD|warlock>	rukuartic, I have to save the PID when i start it, since there might be many with the same name
01:38	<Mulder>	_nano_, there's a project to reverse engineer broadcom wifi, but it's still in experimental development (driver that is)
01:38	<kbrooks>	rukuartic: that's 6.10.
01:38	<livingdaylight>	was that off today?
01:38	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: but even now, it's worth switching to the torrent
01:38	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: no, it's out
01:38	<rukuartic>	kbrooks: Ooooh.
01:38	<livingdaylight>	since when?
01:38	<scheuri>	kbrooks: you noticed that ubuntu.com looks diff...*bang*...;)
01:38	<Mulder>	thoreauputic, wow. when?
01:38	<dodgyvile>	rukuartic: I upgraded to dapper from (5.10) and now the network "resets" every few minutes or so
01:38	<kbrooks>	rukuartic: not 6.06
01:38	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: I have it on my iBook
01:38	<hypnox>	_nano_: worked fine for me with ndiswrapper
01:39	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: a few months now I believe
01:39	<Frogzoo>	dooglus: I can kill the upgrade without encouraging gremlins?
01:39	<livevil>	I've installed a program from synaptic, but I don't know from where I can execute it! Can You say me if there is a way to see the recent installed program?
01:39	<rukuartic>	dodgyvile: wireless? ...odd
01:39	<hypnox>	Frogzoo yes
01:39	<Mulder>	thoreauputic, ah heh. looks like i'm out of date then
01:39	<QPAD|warlock>	Any clues rukuartic ?
01:39	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: cafuego has debs for the firmware
01:39	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: yes.  you can even run the update again, and it will carry on from where it had got to in the download.
01:39	<dodgyvile>	rukuartic: No, ADSL modem, but when I first upgraded it stuck a broken wireless icon in the top bar.
01:39	<Frogzoo>	hypnox: cool, thx both u & dooglus
01:39	<Aarin>	hey i've got a little problem
01:39	<grimboy>	What does apt-get do if you run out of space?
01:39	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: (so long as you don't apt-get clean in the mean time)
01:39	<grimboy>	Help.
01:39	<hypnox>	grimboy: stops
01:39	<dodgyvile>	rukuartic: Could it be polling a non-existant wireless card?
01:40	<rukuartic>	QPAD|warlock: No, sorry... I'm just a newb-geek.... Oh, um... try right clicking and seeing if there's like a default connection setting
01:40	<shriphani>	man when are ubuntu shipping dapper drake!!!!!
01:40	<dooglus>	grimboy: apt-get checks available space before starting to download
01:40	<DeanStl>	apt-get new drive
01:40	<dooglus>	shriphani: about 2 hours ago
01:40	<QPAD|warlock>	Anyone know how to run a application trough shell_exec and save the PID, I have to save the PID when i start it, since there might be many with the same name? ANYONE?
01:40	<rukuartic>	QPAD|warlock: No I'm sorry, wish I had info for you
01:40	<Aarin>	my livecd detects my monitor badly, putting the worg refresh rate
01:40	<QPAD|warlock>	rukuartic np
01:40	<shriphani>	shiping ?
01:40	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/dists/dapper-cafuego/bcm43xx/
01:40	<grimboy>	Err... well I'm out of space and it seems to be carrying on.
01:40	<dooglus>	shriphani: they're shipping it - um - electronically
01:40	<Aarin>	when is instaled is easy to resolve this, modifing the xorg.conf
01:40	<Mulder>	thoreauputic, cheers
01:40	<tz273>	Hey, pls help me! I want to configure my ethernet card to work with a fix ip ( 168.192.1.254 ) but I want it to get the NS servers from the DHCP service. NOW it's using full dhcp.
01:40	<dooglus>	shriphani: yeah, that's it
01:40	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: :)
01:41	<Dimitris>	Is there a dvd version available or just the cd image?
01:41	<souljas>	is the torrent naming ubuntu 6.06 dapper-desktop?
01:41	<Beginer>	Can I browse my Windows partitions with Ubuntu Live CD?
01:41	<marmite>	tz273: I don't think you can have it both ways
01:41	<kbrooks>	dooglus: no. theyre doing CDS too
01:41	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: the driver itself is in the default dapper kernel
01:41	<dodgyvile>	I think the regulars are too busy with the release
01:41	<QPAD|warlock>	Anyone know how to run a application trough shell_exec and save the PID, I have to save the PID when i start it, since there might be many with the same name?
01:41	<marmite>	tz273: unless you configure your dhcp server to give you that ip always
01:41	<kbrooks>	Beginer: bet ya can.
01:41	<Seantater_>	grimboy: so have you df'd?
01:41	<Mulder>	thoreauputic, 3rd party patch i'm guessing?
01:41	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: don't know, sorry
01:41	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: what's shell_exec?
01:41	<Beginer>	I got some erorr
01:41	<grimboy>	Sentater: Sorry, what?
01:41	<cef>	souljas: http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/file?info_hash=%E2%96%B5h%7Fc%15%0F%CA%DB%8F%20%F5%92%5B%94%BA%1B%EC%BF
01:41	<DeanStl>	anyone got the latest madwifi to install?
01:42	<jdmpike>	poor ubuntuforums.org... it is just getting hammered!
01:42	<Seantater_>	grimboy: type df into a terminal -- see what happens
01:42	<souljas>	cef: ty
01:42	<shriphani>	so they aint shipping yet ?
01:42	<thoreauputic>	Mulder: I think it is probably in the restricted modules, but I'm not sure
01:42	<tz273>	marmite: I have to use a router. The only thing, i'v got is a web interface :D
01:42	<QPAD|warlock>	dooglus, runs an application ?
01:42	<Mulder>	thoreauputic, ah would make sense
01:42	<rukuartic>	Alright guys I need to head out. Mega congrats for gettin 6.06 out, hope I can help you guys beta the laptops in the future :)
01:42	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: it's a shell command?  or what?  where/how are you running it?
01:42	<hypnox>	shriphani they have to make a few cd's first..
01:42	<sybariten>	no ideas on locale/kbd problems in xfce?  or are you all wanking over your dapper installs ......
01:42	<shriphani>	they are shipping now !!!!!
01:43	<mathieu>	when i do /msg ubotu upgrade, i get a link to an out-of-date wiki page. how do i properly upgrade to dapper?
01:43	<jadaz87>	thoreauputic: what do they normally do? when they have a release? what do they change the channel to?
01:43	<tz273>	marmite: a program would be enough that gets the NS from the DhcP, all outhers are ok.
01:43	<Grunt>	is there a simple of upgrading from breezy to dapper I have downloaded the iso
01:43	<QPAD|warlock>	dooglus, a command to run shell commands through php
01:43	<aLd>	where in the wiki is the update info
01:43	<jadaz87>	mathieu:  gksudo "update-manager -d"
01:43	<thoreauputic>	jadaz87: they? We didn't change this channel - but there's no #ubuntu+1 until the next development branch is under way
01:44	<jadaz87>	aLd:  gksudo "update-manager -d"
01:44	<hypnox>	mathieu read the message more carefully
01:44	<mathieu>	jadaz87: that upgrade to the _development_ version of ubuntu... i thought dapper was released now?
01:44	<QPAD|warlock>	Any clues dooglus ?
01:44	<jadaz87>	mathieu: you do the same thing
01:44	<thoreauputic>	jadaz87: or did I misunderstand you ?
01:44	<aLd>	jadaz87: that doesnt work
01:44	<Sub>	mathieu, no it will upgrade to dapper currently
01:44	<jadaz87>	math the -d is for distrobution upgrade
01:44	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: oh, PHP - that'll be why I didn't recognise it.  I suggest you ask in a PHP channel...
01:45	<jadaz87>	thoreauputic: yes thank you for clarifying
01:45	<mathieu>	hypnox: i read it carefully. the wiki doesn't know it's released yet.
01:45	<tz273>	could you tell me, how to upgrade my ip address with ifconfig leaving all other records (gw, dns, mask) unchanged?
01:45	<thoreauputic>	mathieu: no it updates to the latest ( now 6.06)
01:45	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: or the PHP manual maybe?  I don't know PHP, it looks kind of ugly to me
01:45	<mathieu>	Sub, thoreauputic: ok
01:45	<neutrinomass>	Is the LiveCD installer much less reliable than the install cd ?
01:45	<rohan>	hi all
01:45	<aLd>	i know but it doesnt work
01:45	<grimboy>	dooglus: It is.
01:45	<rohan>	congrats on release :)
01:45	<thoreauputic>	!doesn't work
01:45	<ubotu>	Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day?  Does it want more money?  Is it on IRC all the time?  Please be specific!  Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
01:45	<aLd>	it just says im upo to date
01:45	<ajayc>	does the latest release have XGL on the disc?
01:45	<ajayc>	does the latest release have XGL on the disc?
01:45	<tz273>	QPAD|warlock: I'm advanced PHP programmer, but i don't find your question
01:45	<rohan>	LOL, thoreauputic
01:45	<QPAD|warlock>	dooglus, well, this is more ubuntu i guess. I need to know how to save a special pid.
01:46	<rohan>	ajayc: ask away
01:46	<QPAD|warlock>	tz273, can we talk for a second then ?
01:46	<laughlin>	how does one make changes to the kernel configuration in ubuntu?
01:46	<neutrinomass>	ajayc: No.
01:46	<zanga>	can someone please help me and tell me how to munt all my partitions
01:46	<QPAD|warlock>	regarding something else, Just to check if you have a solution or ont
01:46	<ajayc>	neutrinomass, do i have to download it?
01:46	<Dreamglider>	good day everyone :)
01:46	<thoreauputic>	zanga:  sudo mount -a  ;-)
01:46	<scheuri>	ajayc: there is a topic in the official forums at www.ubuntuforums.com
01:46	<scheuri>	or org
01:46	<zanga>	thoreauputin thats all ??
01:46	<livingdaylight>	no parties in London???!!!
01:46	<laughlin>	how does one make changes to the kernel configuration in ubuntu?
01:47	<neutrinomass>	ajayc: AFAIK yes.... don't take my word for it though (you might want ask in #ubuntu-xgl )
01:47	<tz273>	QPAD|warlock: sure, i try to go private
01:47	<QPAD|warlock>	tz273, got a second? #php.blabla
01:47	<thoreauputic>	zanga: your question needs refining I think :)
01:47	<uccoffee_loves_B>	ubotu:do i need to login as root to install ndiswrapper?
01:47	<scheuri>	ajayc: there is a topic in the official forums at www.ubuntuforums.org
01:47	<ubotu>	uccoffee_loves_B: parse error: Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
01:47	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: is there a 'fork()' call?  that's how you would usually run a child process and get its PID
01:47	<livingdaylight>	where is the Dapper party in London?
01:47	<ajayc>	neutrinomass, do i have to download it?
01:47	<uccoffee_loves_B>	do i need to login as root to install ndiswrapper?
01:47	<mathieu>	gksudo "upda... -d" says: your system is up-to-date
01:47	<scheuri>	uccoffee_loves_B: you need to have root rights to install software
01:47	<neutrinomass>	uccoffee_loves_B: ubotu is a bot, not a real person :) 'root' is not enabled on Ubuntu so I guess you will have to use 'sudo'
01:47	<Fujitsu>	uccoffee_loves_B, use sudo
01:47	<tz273>	QPAD|warlock: you read me in private?
01:47	<thoreauputic>	!ndiswrapper
01:47	<aLd>	sorry, so i tried what you said gksudo update-manager -d and bang nothing just says im up to date regardless
01:47	<ubotu>	hmm... ndiswrapper is a way to support Windows wireless drivers, but it is buggy compared to native support. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
01:47	<cef>	hrm, running out of disk to hold .iso's for seeding torrents. time to burn files to disk to make room. *grin*
01:47	<Grunt>	sorry for asking the same question that has been asked a million times but to upgrade from breezy to dapper.  Do you just need to type gksudo "update-manager -d"?
01:48	<mathieu>	aLd: same here
01:48	<neutrinomass>	ajayc: As I said, I am not absolutely sure but I think yes.
01:48	<Dreamglider>	is there much diffrence in installing ubuntu 6.06 on a clean partion or doing a dist upgrade ?
01:48	<QPAD|warlock>	tz273, cant you gotta register, and i dont feel like registering atm, can you join #php.blabal ?
01:48	<x3on>	does anyone recommend using ReiserFS for / ?
01:48	<QPAD|warlock>	#php.blabla * - sorry for spam people.
01:48	<neutrinomass>	!upgrade @ Grunt
01:48	<ubotu>	I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, neutrinomass
01:48	<thoreauputic>	Grunt: that's about it, yes
01:48	<neutrinomass>	!update
01:48	<ubotu>	I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, neutrinomass
01:48	<dooglus>	mathieu: what if you don't use '-d'?
01:48	<scheuri>	ajayc: yes, you do need to download it...there is help at the forums! www.ubuntuforums.org
01:48	<marmite>	tz273: your router would be your dhcp server then I guess
01:48	<Fujitsu>	x3on, I always use it.
01:48	<mathieu>	dooglus: the same ..
01:48	<neutrinomass>	(who removed the update thing from ubotu ? )
01:48	<QPAD|warlock>	dooglus: What's 'fork()'
01:48	<QPAD|warlock>	?
01:48	<thoreauputic>	!upgrade
01:49	<Mulder>	Dreamglider, there might be orphaned packages that arent removed (at least that was the case in debian - they might've fixed that now)
01:49	<thoreauputic>	!+upgrade
01:49	<ubotu>	I guess upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
01:49	<makelele>	!upgrade
01:49	<tz273>	i'm there: but you're not :) php.blabal
01:49	<Grunt>	I have actually downloaded the live cd, is there an upgrade from that I can run?
01:49	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: it's a unix system call.  I expect there's something in PHP with a similar name
01:49	<marmite>	tz273: the there should be an option within that to configure a static ip address for your mac address
01:49	<thoreauputic>	that factoid is too long...
01:49	<x3on>	Fujitsu, cool. Swap doesn't require a special FS does it?
01:49	<mathieu>	i guess i'll just hack my source.list
01:49	<morten__>	downloaded and installed ati fglrx driver how do i change to this driver?
01:49	<uccoffee_loves_B>	invalid driver.... what the
01:49	<makelele>	would it be better to upgrade or reinstall
01:49	<zanga>	can someone give me a link to the mounting partition`s page ??
01:49	<marmite>	tz273: within the dhcp settings
01:49	<tz273>	marmite: I will search for, thx
01:49	<Fujitsu>	x3on, just set the partition type as swap.
01:49	<Fujitsu>	!tell zanga about mount
01:49	<uccoffee_loves_B>	why invalid driver.....
01:49	<x3on>	ya
01:49	<uccoffee_loves_B>	:(
01:49	<theine>	!automatix
01:49	<ubotu>	well, automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
01:50	<rizo>	hi does anyone know how to upgrade breezy badger to 6.06
01:50	<marmite>	tz273: ifconfig at a command prompt will tell you your mac address
01:50	<Sub>	yeag theine easyubuntu is better
01:50	<Sub>	!easyubuntu
01:50	<Fujitsu>	!tell rizo about upgrade
01:50	<kbrooks>	theine: ^
01:50	<ubotu>	hmm... easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
01:50	<neutrinomass>	Is the classical install CD more reliable than the LiveCD installer ?
01:50	<thoreauputic>	!tell rizo about upgrade
01:50	<Sub>	neutrinomass, not really.
01:50	<capitanplaneta>	!easyubuntu
01:50	<tz273>	marmite, ok, that's no problem, thanks!
01:50	<pm>	is desktop cd another name for live cd? which iso i should choose for an ordinary installation?
01:50	<uccoffee_loves_B>	thx for teaching me the " sudo "
01:50	<marmite>	tz273: np
01:50	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: in PHP it's got the lovely, easy-to-remember name of "pcntl_fork"
01:50	<Fujitsu>	Hmm..
01:50	<rohan>	!easyubuntu
01:50	<ubotu>	I heard easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
01:50	<Sub>	neutrinomass, the live cd installer lets you irc/browse the web while you install basicallu.
01:50	<Ajay_>	neutrinomass, do i have to download it?
01:50	<rizo>	tHANKS
01:51	<grimboy>	neutrinomass: only if you have less than 192MB of ram.
01:51	<Fujitsu>	SHould I update the upgrade page?
01:51	<Frogzoo>	any recommendations for a fast dapper desktop 386 torrent?
01:51	<makelele>	would it be better to upgrade or reinstall to Dapper
01:51	<Big_T>	hello
01:51	<Sub>	makelele, upgrade.
01:51	<dooglus>	QPAD|warlock: http://phpbuilder.com/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php
01:51	<Fujitsu>	makelele, it's fine to upgrade.
01:51	<Grunt>	sorry to be a pain but using the -d switch will upgrade it to the final version of Dapper, and not a rc?
01:51	<neutrinomass>	Sub : I've been hearing of lots of bugs related to it (there are tons of "ubiquity crashes" on LP) and I want to roll Cds for friends. Haven't used it myself though ...
01:51	<Sub>	Grunt, yes it will.
01:51	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: http://snurl.com/dapper
01:51	<Mulder>	Fujitsu, what about orphaned packages?
01:51	<thoreauputic>	Grunt: correct
01:51	<Frogzoo>	dooglus: cheers, thx
01:51	<neutrinomass>	Ajay_ : As I've already told you twice, I am not positive but I believe that yes, you will have to download it.
01:51	<Fujitsu>	Mulder, the upgrade tool handles it.
01:52	<Mulder>	Fujitsu, cool. that's a nice change from how debian was
01:52	<Ajay_>	sorry i got disconnected
01:52	<Sub>	neutrinomass, well I think for friends, the live cd will probably be more comfortable because the classic install is your typical debian text based install.
01:52	<grimboy>	neutrinomass: If you've been hearing them then surely the bugfixing team will of by now.
01:52	<Grunt>	thanks for the help and paticence guys
01:52	<neutrinomass>	Ajay_ : OK, no hard feelings. You might want to ask in #ubuntu-xgl though
01:52	<scheuri>	Ajay_: there are information of how to install XGL at the forums at www.ubuntuforums.org
01:52	<makelele>	has Dapper been released as yet and can i begin the upgrade ?
01:52	<Jeeves_>	makelele: Yes
01:52	<thoreauputic>	makelele: yes and yes
01:52	<rohan>	makelele: it might be slow, but yes it has been released
01:53	<neutrinomass>	grimboy: That would imply that all ubiquity bugs that I've seen have been closed. Anyway, I'll try grabbing the LiveCD and hope there will be no problems :)
01:53	<thoreauputic>	makelele: use a torrent if possible and leave it up after you finish
01:53	<thoreauputic>	makelele: URLs in the /topic
01:53	<Ekushey>	6.06 released?
01:53	<netgrabber>	do i need proposed?
01:53	<Frogzoo>	!torrent
01:53	<ubotu>	See http://www.snurl.com/dapper
01:53	<thoreauputic>	Ekushey: yes
01:54	<kimo>	guys, how do I save iptables rules, so they're restored automatically ?
01:54	<Fujitsu>	Ekushey, yes.
01:54	<zanga>	!tell zanga about mounting hdd
01:54	<pedrocr>	to upgrade a server installation I should just edit /etc/apt/sources.list and s/breezy/dapper/g?
01:54	<Ekushey>	cool :)
01:54	<Fujitsu>	kimo, you need to write a script to do it.
01:54	<zanga>	!tell zanga about mounting
01:54	<pm>	what;s the difference between desktop and alternate? which one is closer to breezy's installation version
01:54	<Fujitsu>	kimo, look at the manpage, there is a way to make it export the rules.
01:54	<kimo>	pedrocr: no
01:54	<uccoffee_loves_B>	still invalid driver .....
01:54	<HelmutG>	shipit.ubuntu.com offers me (among other things) 1 Ubuntu CD for PC. Can you give me some information on what is on that CD? (As a Debian-user I am used to software does _not_ fit on 5 CDs, but I'd like to give my relatives a chance to switch from Windows. :-)
01:54	<thoreauputic>	pm: alternae
01:54	<pedrocr>	kimo: what then?
01:54	<Fujitsu>	pm, alrernate is the same as Breezy's.
01:54	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
01:54	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no Live session available on it.
01:54	<rohan>	!xgl
01:54	<apokryphos>	pm: /msg ubotu desktop ; /msg ubotu alternate
01:54	<ubotu>	I guess xgl is "XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/"
01:54	<kimo>	!upgrade
01:54	<ubotu>	methinks upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
01:54	<netgrabber>	!proposed
01:54	<ubotu>	netgrabber: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
01:54	<kimo>	pedrocr: got that ?
01:55	<livingdaylight>	where is the London Dapper Party?
01:55	<morten__>	anyone know where graphics drivers are configured?
01:55	<Fujitsu>	Hmm.
01:55	<rohan>	are xgl and compiz included on the official ubuntu cd ?
01:55	<Fujitsu>	morten__, what about them.
01:55	<Seveas>	no
01:55	<Fujitsu>	rohan, no.
01:55	<hypnox>	pedrocr: doing what you suggested works fine for me
01:55	<kimo>	pedrocr: got that ?
01:55	<Fujitsu>	!tell rohan about xgl
01:55	<Seveas>	rohan, they most likely never will be
01:55	<pedrocr>	kimo: yes, but it suggests I should do just that
01:55	<HelmutG>	Is there some site listing what is on the ubuntu cd?
01:55	<apokryphos>	they might be fore Edgy
01:55	<pm>	did breezy's live cd have an installation option as well?
01:55	<zjimbo>	The white guy standing next to the two kids on ubuntu.com looks kinda scary...
01:55	<dyn>	!tell dyn about xgl
01:55	<morten__>	I want to use ati fglrx , ive downloaded and installed drivers i think
01:55	<Fujitsu>	pm, no.
01:56	<rohan>	Fujitsu: i know that, thanks
01:56	<rohan>	:)
01:56	<kimo>	pedrocr: no, it's update-manager -d
01:56	<pedrocr>	kimo: no, that's for the graphical update
01:56	<galotzas>	!upgrade
01:56	<ubotu>	from memory, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
01:56	<mikey>	can anyone tell me, if i run xserver-xorg-xgl or whatever it is, will that slow down my gpu if i want to run another opengl game?
01:56	<zjimbo>	it's probably Mark Shuttleworth.
01:56	<sybariten>	whats the adress to a swedish ubunbtu forum
01:56	<pedrocr>	kimo: I'm on a server, there's no graphical environment
01:56	<kimo>	pedrocr: not really
01:56	<hypnox>	pedrocr just change your sources.list and go ahead and apt-get dist-upgrade
01:56	<Frogzoo>	!torrent
01:56	<ubotu>	The 'official' Dapper torrent can be found at http://www.snurl.com/dapper
01:56	<pedrocr>	kimo: it has some text mode instructions
=== CN_EricNeon is now known as Eric7fan
01:56	<pedrocr>	kimo: although they state you should install ubuntu-desktop which seems odd
01:56	<rohan>	someone needs to update - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
01:56	<viola>	hi. does anyone know if the 6.06 desktop cd can be used to update breezy? or should i get the server one?
01:56	<tarzeau>	anyone got an idea how to tell update-grub to put lock entries to all menu entries but the first or the default?
01:57	<rohan>	tarzeau: did you do !popcon :)
01:57	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, so you get any new packages.
01:57	<tarzeau>	!popcon
01:57	<ubotu>	rumour has it, popcon is popularity contest, a package which is installed by default on all ubuntu machines, but aint configured, and therefore not "running". Type this in a terminal to contribute: sudo dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest
01:57	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: that's the official 386 desktop torrent only.
01:57	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: but I don't want a desktop, it's a server
01:57	<Seveas>	viola, you need the alternate for that
01:57	<makelele>	is this the correct link to go to in order to upgrade to Dapper
01:57	<makelele>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
01:57	<tarzeau>	rohan: wrong channel, man!
01:57	<rohan>	tarzeau: i know, i just wanted to poke you nevertheless ;)
01:57	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, install the appropriate virtual package for that, then.
01:57	<noodle>	what's the difference between emacs and emacs21?
01:58	<Fujitsu>	ubuntu-server, or something.
01:58	<tuxtheslacker>	wow, snurl must be getting hammered....
01:58	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: it should be installed, it's a standard "server" ubuntu install
01:58	<dooglus>	noodle: emacs is a metapackage which depends on emacs21
01:58	<thoreauputic>	noodle: the number 21 is on the end of one of them ? *g*
01:58	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: my question was how to upgrade those
01:58	<tuxtheslacker>	does anyone have a non-official download they can verify iit works?
01:58	<viola>	Seveas, thanks. i'm having trouble with update-manager, it gives me a "could not calculate the upgrade" error. doi you think i might have the same error with the alternate version?
01:58	<Chobo-Mog>	hmm...I go to sleep and there's ~850 people in here.  I guess being at 1020+ is a good sign ^___^
01:58	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, your best bet is to probably modify sources.list and dist-upgrade...
01:58	<noodle>	dooglus: ok i can install emacs-nox or emacs21-nox which 1 do i want?
01:59	<Fujitsu>	Chobo-Mog, certainly :)
01:59	<dooglus>	noodle: you want it without X?
01:59	<noodle>	dooglus: yea
01:59	<pm>	one more quetsion, i'm using dapper beta, should i upgrade via apt-get upgrade or is it advisiable to install the final release anew?
01:59	<dooglus>	noodle: what you really want is my home-made package of the latest emacs21 from CVS :)
01:59	<Fujitsu>	pm, apt-get dist-upgrade.
01:59	<jdmpike>	after upgrade, is anyone having freenx problems?
01:59	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: yes, and I've done this with debian and knew how to do it. I just find it strange that there's no process for upgrading server installations
01:59	<rixth>	What is the md5 of the desktop iso?
01:59	<rixth>	i386
01:59	<dooglus>	noodle: there hasn't been an emacs release for a few years
01:59	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, a number of people have noted this.
01:59	<grimboy>	Wow, I had a useless temp file that was taking up 5GB of space and filling up the hard disk
02:00	<noodle>	dooglus: lol just answer me pls -_- what's the difference between the two
02:00	<tuxtheslacker>	is there a way to upgrade with the CDs?
02:00	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: sound issues after using freenx here, yes
02:00	<Fujitsu>	tuxtheslacker, only with the alternate or server CD.
02:00	<makelele>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades - this link still says that this is beta software - could this be that this page has just not ben updated as yet ?
02:00	<dooglus>	noodle: there is no difference.  emacs is an empty package which pulls in emacs21.
02:00	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: set the CD as the source
02:00	<Fujitsu>	makelele, it just hasn't been updated.
02:00	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: I assume the package from breezy doesn't quite fit dapper :)
02:00	<rohan>	makelele: yes, the page is not updated
02:00	<pm>	Fujitsu: are you sure there won't be any problems if i upgrade this way?
02:00	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: them distupgrade
02:00	<jdmpike>	thoreauputic, I can't log in remotely - any ideas?
02:00	<dooglus>	noodle: some day it will pull in emacs22 instead
02:00	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: ah, that I haven't struck
02:00	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: Ill be doing this myself once the download finishes
02:00	<scheuri>	noodle: aptitude show emacs-nox AND aptitude show emacs21-nox
02:01	<Fastly>	anyone else here experience problems with NetworkManager after internet upgrade from breezy to dapper?
02:01	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, where's the sources disk?
02:01	<makelele>	rohan: so it is safe to perform those steps on that page to upgrade to the released version of Dapper ?
02:01	<livingdaylight>	is there an easy one click upgrade from breezy to dapper?
02:01	<dooglus>	noodle: if you want to see this, run: "apt-cache show emacs-nox"
02:01	<makelele>	Fujitsu: so it is safe to perform those steps on that page to upgrade to the released version of Dapper ?
02:01	<grimboy>	jdmpike: So ssh 127.1 doesn't work?
02:01	<jdmpike>	thoreauputic, ssh works fine - I am logged into it right now remotely
02:01	<Frogzoo>	Fujitsu: if you set the desktop cd in the repos, will apt-get upgrade work?
02:01	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: the desktop install CD'll have the packages on it
02:01	<Fastly>	NetworkManager has stopped showing live wireless signals
02:01	<Sampizcat>	Hello all
02:01	<Fujitsu>	Frogzoo, the desktop CD doesn't have the packages!
02:01	<Sampizcat>	I have a question
02:01	<livingdaylight>	Guys, i cannot hold my breath any longer i need to upgrade to Dapper right now!
02:01	<tuxtheslacker>	what's the command to upgrade with apt?
02:01	<livingdaylight>	help!
02:01	<Fujitsu>	!ask
02:01	<ubotu>	For information on how to ask good questions please see http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html The more information you can give the better we can help you. If your going to give output of commands please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
02:01	<rohan>	makelele: easiest way is to Press alt-f2 type gksudo "update-manager"
02:01	<rohan>	makelele: NOT the -d
02:01	<Frogzoo>	Fujitsu: great, thx
02:01	<noodle>	dooglus: ah ic
02:02	<jdmpike>	!pastebin
02:02	<Fujitsu>	tuxtheslacker, apt-get dist-upgrade
02:02	<ubotu>	Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
02:02	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, so if I use it, it'll work?
02:02	<pseudodeadkitty>	Hehehe....the .iso is burning. :)
02:02	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: sorry - I don't know enough about freenx to help I fear: i just used Seveas 's packages
02:02	<shriphani>	hey how do i upgrade to dapper from breezy
02:02	<Sampizcat>	Has the Dapper install "frozen" at "Installing GRUB boot loader" for anyone else?
02:02	<hypnox>	makelele, page just updated.
02:02	<shriphani>	cuz i ordered the cd
02:02	<exhale>	Sampizcat, nope... maybe its a bad disc?
02:02	<tuxtheslacker>	Fujitsu, it tells me it doesn't have to....
02:02	<Fujitsu>	!tell shriphani about upgrade
02:02	<bimberi>	ubotu tell shriphani about upgrade
02:02	<livingdaylight>	rohan; what does that do?
02:02	<zanga>	how do i mount windows partitions
02:02	<sybariten>	is the forum fkuced up _
02:02	<jdmpike>	Seveas, do you have any idea why I can't use freenx after upgrade?
02:02	<noodle>	scheuri: thx as well it does the same thing ^^
02:02	<exhale>	!ntfs
02:02	<rixth>	!windowspartiions
02:02	<ubotu>	to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe. <!winfstab>
02:02	<ubotu>	rixth: Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
02:02	<sybariten>	?
02:02	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: I dont see why not, it'll have the debs on the CD somewhere, you just have to point to it in your sources.list. plus the sources.list points to the CD anyway in freshly installed ubuntu
02:02	<Sampizcat>	exhale:  crumbs, I can test the disk though right?
02:02	<Fujitsu>	tuxtheslacker, did you update your sources.list to dapper entries?
02:02	<Seveas>	jdmpike, did you upgrade freenx to the dapper version too?
02:02	<pm>	i think i'd better install official release anew
02:03	<C_REATIVE_>	!winfstab
02:03	<ubotu>	in fstab it should look **like** this:: /dev/hda1       /media/windows  ntfs    nls=utf8,ro,user,umask=000 0       0
02:03	<livingdaylight>	Guys, i cannot hold my breath any longer. Is my name David Blaine?! NO!, i need Dapper right NOW!
02:03	<Rambo3>	use !tell instead
02:03	<Fujitsu>	kestas, the Desktop CD doesn't have any packages on it!
02:03	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, get it then!
02:03	<livingdaylight>	rohan, help me man!
02:03	<kbrooks>	livingdaylight: GET IT
02:03	<zanga>	Fujitsu can u help me install my windows partitions in linux ??
02:03	<kestas>	really? how does it install things then?
02:03	<tuxtheslacker>	Fujitsu, no i didn't, how would I do that?
02:03	<rohan>	livingdaylight: what is the problem ?
02:03	<steko>	Hello everybody
02:03	<livingdaylight>	HOW?
02:03	<kestas>	it must have the debs on there
02:03	<rohan>	livingdaylight: and, who are you ? :)
02:03	<exhale>	!ntfs
02:03	<ubotu>	to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe. <!winfstab>
02:03	<Fujitsu>	ubotu, tell zanga about mount.
02:03	<Seveas>	livingdaylight, read the fricken link in the topic...
02:03	<Fujitsu>	kestas, IT DOES NOT.
02:03	<steko>	I'm in trouble, I can't start OpenOffice
02:03	<livingdaylight>	i am someone who need Dapper right NOW
02:03	<Sampizcat>	exhale:  I might just let this wait overnight
02:03	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, THEN GET IT!
02:03	<steko>	It doesn't go beyond the splash screen
02:03	<Sampizcat>	see what it does
02:04	<rohan>	livingdaylight: yes, so download the iso, or upgrade from breezy
02:04	<Seveas>	kestas, the live cd installer copies the filesystem, no debs involved
02:04	<livingdaylight>	rohan: i want to upgrade from Breezy
02:04	<livingdaylight>	rohan, no not iso way
02:04	<hypnox>	livingdaylight https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
02:04	<Seveas>	livingdaylight, again: READ THE FRICKEN LINK
02:04	<kestas>	Seveas: hmm I see, less elegant but faster
02:04	<steko>	I'm on dapper
02:04	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, see the link in the topic?
02:04	<rohan>	livingdaylight: so press alt-f2 type gksudo "update-manager"
02:04	<viola>	is anyone getting a "could not calculate the upgrade" error while trying to update from breezy through dapper via gksudo "update-manager"?
02:04	<thoreauputic>	!tell livingdaylight about upgrade
02:04	<livingdaylight>	seveas: i saw no link that tells how to upgrade from Breezy in the topic
02:04	<rohan>	livingdaylight: thats the most direct way
02:04	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, sudo "upgrade-manager -d"
02:04	<livingdaylight>	GUYS, thank you!
02:04	<shriphani>	hey guys will the update manager download the entire dapper package which is 718 MB ?
02:04	<Doso>	Oh happy day.. 6.06 dvd torrent is here ;] 
02:04	<rohan>	really, dont point to that wiki page ! -d might kill :P
02:05	<robinl1>	YAY!
02:05	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, the stuff it needs.
02:05	<tuxtheslacker>	synaptic will auto add a cdrom to the updates?
02:05	<hypnox>	rohan, that is now fixed
02:05	<rixth>	Okie, time to reboot and install Dapper final! (instead of upgrading). Wish me luck!
02:05	<Fujitsu>	tuxtheslacker, yes.
02:05	<rohan>	hypnox: ah, ok :)
02:05	<Fujitsu>	See you, rixth.
02:05	<Patrick1>	is kubuntu & ubuntu included in the dvd or are there 2 dvd images?
02:05	<livingdaylight>	which one upgrade-manager -d or gksudo '"update-manager"
02:05	<shriphani>	oh cool !!!
02:05	<grimboy>	rixth, Good luck
02:05	<rixth>	Back soon hopefully!
02:05	<livingdaylight>	I am consused again
02:05	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, the latter.
02:05	<livingdaylight>	i need to have the best way
02:05	<Seveas>	Patrick1, both are on the same dvd
02:05	<Patrick1>	ah nice, thx
02:05	<sybariten>	can anybody here search on the ubuntu forums ?
02:05	<Seveas>	livingdaylight, gksudo "update-manager -c"
02:05	<tuxtheslacker>	2 hours left on the download.... it needs to hewwy!
02:06	<kestas>	so just to clarify; can you update from a CD?
02:06	<galotzas>	the ubuntu forums is down ?
02:06	<tuxtheslacker>	I ahve a question... can someone hlep me to completely remove picasa?
02:06	<livingdaylight>	seveas: huh? c?
02:06	<rohan>	ubuntu has got nice servers and bandwidth .. for example, the day suse 10.1 was out, opensuse site was absolutely b0rked
02:06	<bimberi>	kestas: yes, the "alternate" cd
02:06	<Frogzoo>	!torrent
02:06	<tuxtheslacker>	I need to reinstall... it broke it.
02:06	<capitanplaneta>	if I run gksudo "update-manager" without the -d, no upgrade is available
02:06	<livingdaylight>	I need the Truth on this
02:06	<sybariten>	if i remove the locales package and reinstall it, do i run the risk of getting for instance Firefox in swedish?? i only want the swedish keyboard, i DONT want to run "swedish programs"
02:06	<Fujitsu>	kestas, yes, but not the Desktop one!
02:06	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: depends how you installed it
02:06	<kestas>	Fujitsu: k
02:06	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, a .deb package.
02:06	<Sampizcat>	What's the difference between the server and alternate versions?
02:06	<grimboy>	capitanplaneta, run it with it then.
02:06	<capitanplaneta>	ok
02:07	<rohan>	Sampizcat: server wont give x and gnome like alternate
02:07	<grimboy>	Sampizcat, The server has demons useful for serbing
02:07	<tuxtheslacker>	sudo dpkg -r picasa still leaves remnants because apt-get install picasa breaks.
02:07	<Frogzoo>	!torrent
02:07	<ubotu>	Torrent ubuntu-6.06-desktop-386.iso found at http://www.snurl.com/dapper, for other architectures see: http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs/6.06 Note: to upgrade, you need the 'alternate' .iso - the desktop iso is install only
02:07	<capitanplaneta>	I guess I should remove the extra repositories automatix introduced on my list before upgrading
02:07	<grimboy>	Sampizcat, Like lamp straight out of the box, (even thought php sucks and mysql isn't ACID complient)
02:07	<Sampizcat>	apparently, "alternate" is used if you want to do RAID partitioning (which I do), but then I was able to setup sw RAID with the server version - wth?
02:07	<Frogzoo>	any complaints to !torrent ^^^ ?
02:07	<rohan>	alternate is ROCKING, cos it has gcc, unlike the desktop cd :P
02:07	<monk_>	hi, i have a problem with hotkeys for my acer travelmate laptop, on FN+F5 it crashes (using ubuntu 6.06 LTS)
02:08	<tuxtheslacker>	Package picasa is not available, but is referred to by another package.
02:08	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: how does it break? did you get rid of config files too?
02:08	<tuxtheslacker>	what does that mean?
02:08	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, I did a purge.
02:08	<tuxtheslacker>	a remove and then a purge.
02:08	<Sampizcat>	Ah smeg. Stupid program, I think it's broken.
02:08	<Fujitsu>	capitanplaneta, automatix may cause issues with an upgrade.
02:08	<rackerz>	Anybody know why the Ubuntu forums are so slow?
02:08	<kestas>	rackerz: think about it
02:08	<wheelswitch>	rackerz, because they are getting hammerd
02:08	<surface>	rohan: i tot alternate is used for upgrade
02:08	<Frogzoo>	rackerz: I'm guessing same servers as the repos probly
02:08	<capitanplaneta>	Fujitsu: thx, I'll remove automatix first, then
02:09	<Fujitsu>	surface, it can be.
02:09	<rohan>	surface: yes, it is
02:09	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, if you want, I can send you the strace?
02:09	<rackerz>	yeah they are being hammered i just noticed this, Total Users Online: 1554
02:09	<rackerz>	Total Members: 372
02:09	<rackerz>	Total Guests: 1182
02:09	<Fujitsu>	capitanplaneta, it will likely cause issues even after removal.
02:09	<rohan>	because the desktop cd doesnt have .deb's unlike the alternate one
02:09	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: I wouldnt know what to do with it, Im not sure what the prob is
02:09	<tiCo89>	thank you for the new release :-)
02:09	<capitanplaneta>	Fujitsu: omg! :)
02:09	<surface>	Fujitsu, rohan : can alternate cd install on fresh partition too?
02:09	<rackerz>	What are the main differences between the dkestop cd and alternate?
02:09	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, which is why strace would help ;-)
02:09	<Exter-C>	I have some questions regarding future plans for Dapper as a commercial distribution, Is this the right place?
02:09	<Fujitsu>	surface, of course!
02:09	<robinl1>	is downloading from ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ illigal? I did.
02:09	<livingdaylight>	my sytem is upgrading as we speak - 35 mins to go!
02:09	<rohan>	Exter-C: yes
02:09	<capitanplaneta>	I will clean up my repositories list
02:09	<surface>	Fujitsu: cool
02:09	<Sampizcat>	rackerz:  The desktop CD is like a live cd
02:09	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
02:09	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no Live session available on it.
02:10	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, it's not recommended.
02:10	<livingdaylight>	seveas: i'm so excited man!
02:10	<robinl1>	why isn't it recommended?
02:10	<rohan>	livingdaylight: did you start the update ?
02:10	<robinl1>	I did, is there any difference?
02:10	<Fujitsu>	As it's generally old/really new (pre-stable).
02:10	<livingdaylight>	rohan: YeS! i'm so excited!
02:10	<robinl1>	it's not..
02:10	<robinl1>	the real one?
02:10	<Fujitsu>	Although, if you get the right one, it's OK.
02:10	<surface>	thx ubotu
02:10	<pseudodeadkitty>	It's ready. It's off to install Dapper on a clean partition- wish me luck. :)
02:10	<robinl1>	DAMN, then i have to reinstall AGAIN
02:10	<Fujitsu>	Why?
02:10	<rohan>	robinl1: why ?
02:10	<robinl1>	well, i installed ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
02:10	<rackerz>	Yep, see you in abit guys. I'm off to install ;)
02:10	<robinl1>	from the pol
02:10	<robinl1>	pool*
02:10	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, when did you get the image?
02:10	<scheuri>	robinl1: NO, you dont!!
02:11	<Fujitsu>	There have been a couple of versions.
02:11	<robinl1>	Today.
02:11	<tuxtheslacker>	mmap2(0xfa5f0000, 131072, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0) = 0x7bee0000
02:11	<tuxtheslacker>	munmap(0x7bee0000, 131072)              = 0
02:11	<tuxtheslacker>	
02:11	<Seveas>	robinl1, so? then you simply upgrade...
02:11	<Sampizcat>	Does Alternative have extra RAID features of server?
02:11	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, just wait till you run out of disk space and half of the install fails.
02:11	<tuxtheslacker>	anyone know how i would go about fixing that?
02:11	<Chobo-Mog>	lol so many files on the BT tracker
02:11	<surface>	emmm that means desktop version have GUI installation
02:11	<pettman>	it is 4 hours before I even can start installing :(
02:11	<sybariten>	is there a package called locales ?
02:11	<Sampizcat>	sybariten:  most likely yes
02:11	<thoreauputic>	!info locales
02:11	<robinl1>	Seveas: How to upgrade with the old version of Ubuntu dapper drake running and without going to Edgy?
02:11	<Exter-C>	I noticed some time ago that Ubuntu has been 'certified' for DB2. We currently use Redhat for anything that requires commercial software, however we much prefer debian, With dapper now being out and having a longer support cycles for the server distrib I am interested to know if a) there are any intensions for Ubuntu to become certified for Oracl, and B) if there is any roadmap paln to have support or certification for commercial backup products like Verit
02:11	<ubotu>	locales: (GNU C Library: National Language (locale) data [support] ), section base, is important. Version: 2.3.5-1ubuntu12.5.10.1 (breezy), Packaged size: 3963 kB, Installed size: 10584 kB
02:11	<livingdaylight>	grimboy: hey, don't say that!  :D
02:11	<surface>	did anyone here tried desktop installer? do it have package selection options?
02:11	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, just sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.
02:11	<Chobo-Mog>	regular desktop users without 64 bit procs should use the ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso torrent right"?
02:11	<Fujitsu>	surface, no.
02:12	<Fujitsu>	surface, no package options.
02:12	<Fujitsu>	Chobo-Mog, yes.
02:12	<Frogzoo>	seems there are no DVD torrents?
02:12	<Chobo-Mog>	excellent, ty
02:12	<Dimitris>	Well this is confusing! :-D I just repartition my hd for a fresh install. What do i download Desktop or Alternate? I don't want ending up with a live cd!
02:12	<viola>	does anyone know how to "uninstall" changes made by automatix?
02:12	<SunTzuTech>	Frogzoo: noticed the same
02:12	<Fujitsu>	Dimitris, Desktop will do.
02:12	<robinl1>	It says there are no updates.
02:12	<Chobo-Mog>	dvd torrents were there I think
02:12	<wheelswitch>	Frogzoo, there are dvd torrents
02:12	<Chousuke>	Dimitris: desktop
02:12	<Fujitsu>	viola, it's very difficult.
02:12	<surface>	Fujitsu: i think server version might be have...
02:12	<Dimitris>	thnx
02:12	<robinl1>	Dimitris: ALTERNATE
02:12	<robinl1>	ALTERNATE!!
02:12	<robinl1>	Desktop is the live CD
02:12	<Chousuke>	:(
02:12	<Fujitsu>	surface, the expert thing does.
02:12	<grimboy>	Exter-C, get in contact with a support sales representative if your a suit.
02:12	<Chousuke>	robinl1: um
02:12	<viola>	fujitsu, will it ruin the upgrade process even if i get the alternate cd?
02:13	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; be an optimist  :D
02:13	<thoreauputic>	Dimitris: desktop has an installer and live CD in one
02:13	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, the Desktop thing caxn install!
02:13	<Seveas>	robinl1, so?
02:13	<Chousuke>	robinl1: the live CD and the installer have been unified.
02:13	<robinl1>	true..
02:13	<Fujitsu>	viola, it /may/.
02:13	<wheelswitch>	http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/release/dvd/
02:13	<Frogzoo>	wheelswitch: url?
02:13	<monk_>	anyone can help me with hotkeys?
02:13	<wheelswitch>	Frogzoo, http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/release/dvd/
02:13	<Seveas>	installed system is installed system....
02:13	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; love your Ubuntu
02:13	<Fujitsu>	monk_, explain your problem.
02:13	<Frogzoo>	wheelswitch: thx mate
02:13	<Exter-C>	grimboy: i am not a suit, but I would love to remove redhat from our internal servers.
02:13	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, yeh, sorry that's just what happend to me, cause I only had like 500mb left
02:13	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; hehe
02:13	<surface>	wheelswitch: dvd have all alternate ,desktop and server ?
02:13	<kevor>	wow, ubuntu.com is totally loaded
02:13	<robinl1>	Seveas, is there any difference between downloading Dapper today at 06:00 at the Netherlandish timezone, on the pool?
02:13	<wheelswitch>	Frogzoo, only 2 seeds at the moment, but give it an hour or 10 and that should be change
02:13	<Krank>	Is the DVD release a Live install one?
02:13	<wheelswitch>	surface, yes, as far as i know
02:13	<Sampizcat>	mmm. I don't think this installer is going anywhere...
02:13	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; how big is your harddrive?
02:14	<Chobo-Mog>	DVD Torrents --->	 http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/  The torrent's name is ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso   and it's 3.13gb for i386 users
02:14	<monk_>	Fujitsu, i'm usind ubuntu 6.06 on acer travelmate 2354 and when i try FN+F5 (vga output) it freezes
02:14	<Exter-C>	grimboy: however to do so its one of those chicken and egg situations, to remove redhat we need to know the distribution is certified by the vendors otherwise management will most likely laugh at the proposals
02:14	<scheuri>	robinl1: if you update it there isnt...dont worry
02:14	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; what do you mean you only had 500mb left?
02:14	<monk_>	same problem with ubuntu 5.10
02:14	<Fujitsu>	monk_, that's not a hotkey issue.
02:14	<threat>	50Kb from the xubuntu site :(
02:14	<fiendskull9>	so is this now a drake channel too?
02:14	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, 10GB but I have an external 250GB one.
02:14	<Fujitsu>	That'll be a graphics driver issue.
02:14	<Seveas>	robinl1, the .pool were testing cd's
02:14	<threat>	where can I find some more mirrors?
02:14	<Fujitsu>	fiendskull9, Dapper has been released, so yes.
02:14	<Sampizcat>	threat:  mirrors are you friend :)
02:14	<Seveas>	they may have been broken
02:14	<robinl1>	yes and #ubuntu+1 is about edgy
02:14	<monk_>	Fujitsu, what can I do?
02:14	<Frogzoo>	wheelswitch: I'm assuming these have all the packages so are good to upgrade from?
02:14	<robinl1>	Seveas: so this is not the right one?
02:14	<fiendskull9>	grimboy, why dont you make the 250 internal, and 10 ext.?
02:14	<Fujitsu>	monk_, I have no experience with Acer laptops.
02:14	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; 250!  '<  should be enough?
02:14	<grimboy>	Exter-C, Just put together a slideshow, they love those.
02:15	<pm>	what time did the isos appear on the servers? (it's 14.15 right now for me)
02:15	<Seveas>	robinl1, if it installed then it's ok
02:15	<surface>	look forward to fubuntu haha
02:15	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, just apt-get dist-upgrade.
02:15	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  I have an acer laptop, and I find that most linux distros don't work with the hotkeys
02:15	<fiendskull9>	will dist-upgrade give me a stable dapper system then?
02:15	<sybariten>	but is locales something related specifically to ubuntu?  oh why o why cant there just be a single simple keyboard setting that would affect X as well as the console???!
02:15	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, That's mounted at /music
02:15	<robinl1>	Seveas: it DID install.. but is there any difference?
02:15	<Fujitsu>	3 hours ago, pm.
02:15	<hypnox>	DapperUpgrades much improved hopefully
02:15	<sybariten>	and for all linuxes
02:15	<surface>	anyway i turn my ubuntu to fluxbox version
02:15	<waym>	when did it come out? a few hours ago?
02:15	<monk_>	Sampizcat, other hotkeys work fine, just this one does not
02:15	<grimboy>	fiendskull9, Cause I'm stupid
02:15	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, not if you dist-upgrade.
02:15	<capitanplaneta>	what's different on the dapper DVD from the CD? what else does it contain?
02:15	<rixth>	Haha, I am on IRC while installing woo!
02:15	<wheelswitch>	waym, yeah, about 3 hours now i think
02:15	<Seveas>	robinl1, yes there is difference, but that's why you do apt-get upgrade
02:15	<pm>	Fujitsu: thanks for reply :)
02:15	<spikeb>	woo
02:15	<rixth>	24%.
02:15	<waym>	thank you!
02:15	<robinl1>	Fujitsu: after i installed this thing, i updated, no updates.
02:15	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  maybe issues with the video out?
02:15	<Fujitsu>	robinl1 it's OK then.
02:16	<robinl1>	And now i tried updating too, now updates
02:16	<fiendskull9>	ill dist-upgrade while im at band practice later
02:16	<scheuri>	robinl1: that means that you have the same ubuntu as we all have
02:16	<robinl1>	no*
02:16	<robinl1>	ok
02:16	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, did you apt-get update, then apt-get dist-upgrade?
02:16	<robinl1>	yes\
02:16	<Sampizcat>	Grr, my installer is stuck on "Installing GRUB boot loader", 50%, been there for about 20 mins
02:16	<fiendskull9>	i had a test flight running a few days ago, but got tired of 15 updates every 5 minutes :P
02:16	<Fujitsu>	OK, that's fine then.
02:16	<rixth>	I am suprised that the install CD does not come with xChat.... I freuently booted into my 5.04 live disc and used xChat when dapper wouldn't start.
02:16	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, what hardware?
02:16	<robinl1>	rixth: i think Gaim replaces it.
02:16	<Fujitsu>	rixth, Gaim is an IRC client.
02:16	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, check md5
02:16	<robinl1>	...
02:16	<spikeb>	rixth, yeah, the earlier releases came with it
02:16	<MistaED>	i'm not sure if i should list this as a bug: i tried the expresso installer with dapper RC and used the partitioner (56gb NTFS + 4gb FAT32) and removed the fat32, shrunk the 56gb to 12gb (sda1), added 8gb ext3 (sda2 for /), 512mb swap (sda3), the rest ext3 (sda4), it took awhile to shrink but it worked, but then the next window to set mount points didn't show sda2 at all
02:16	<monk_>	Sampizcat, i don't know. everything runs very well, just when i press FN+F5...
02:16	<bimberi>	rixth: gaim can handle irc and cd space is at a premium
02:16	<grimboy>	robinl1, Have you tried -d
02:17	<robinl1>	grimboy: no! i don't want edgy!
02:17	<waym>	ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso              <<< 3.3 gigs, what's in this?
02:17	<rixth>	robin, Fujitsu that is what I am using right now.
02:17	<tahorg>	waym: dvd image
02:17	<robinl1>	me too.
02:17	<Fujitsu>	MistaED, if it's being silly it is probably a bug.
02:17	<MistaED>	the fix i did was just formatting sda2-4 manually, then expresso was all good
02:17	<scheuri>	waym: everything...:)
02:17	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  MB-Asus P5WD2-E Premium, Intel D940, 4x512MB Corsair DDR2 667Mhz, 4x300GB Seagate SATA2, DVD Burner
02:17	<robinl1>	the gaim IRC client kind of owns
02:17	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  what happens exactly?
02:17	<Fujitsu>	Hmm..
02:17	<Fujitsu>	SATA2 may be a bit of an issue.
02:17	<robinl1>	Seveas, are there any speed optimizers in the official release?
02:17	<tahorg>	waym: it looks like full repository
02:17	<rixth>	robin1, you being sarcastic?
02:17	<MistaED>	i can't test it now with full dapper =/
02:17	<robinl1>	cuz this Dapper is a bit slow.
02:17	<grimboy>	robinl1: But you can update from edgy to official in a couple of hours or so.
02:17	<waym>	 yummy
02:17	<robinl1>	No, rixth, i aren't.
02:18	<Seveas>	"speed optimizers"?
02:18	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  Jeez, are you serious?
02:18	<wheelswitch>	waym, the dvd is the bling
02:18	<monk_>	Sampizcat, when i try to enable vga output, to use a video projector, the system freezes
02:18	<robinl1>	yes, the beta Dapper was fast, but this thing is a bit slower
02:18	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, it may have some issues.
02:18	<rixth>	I think it is rather simplistic, then again, eac to his own =)
02:18	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, I doubt it.
02:18	<rambo3>	so there where no updates since yesterday on default u-dapper since yesterday
02:18	<Seveas>	robinl1, then you may need to reinstal with the official cd
02:18	<robinl1>	i think it's the videocard..
02:18	<robinl1>	xD
02:18	<apokryphos>	rambo3: that's correct
02:18	<robinl1>	Is that really needed? luckily, i back-upped EVERYTHING
02:18	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  damnit. I wanted ubuntu because I thought it was going to work with Sata2, be up to date enough.
02:18	<robinl1>	So.. There i go again. Wish me luck, then
02:18	<eXistenZ>	the only way to install ubuntu is through the live cd?
02:18	<robinl1>	I'll just do it to be sure
02:18	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, it probably will.
02:18	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  I'll check the MD5 like wheelswitch suggested.
02:18	<Fujitsu>	eXistenZ, no!
02:18	<grimboy>	robinl1, Good luck.
02:19	<rixth>	Good luck robin1!
02:19	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, that's your best bet.
02:19	<robinl1>	Thanks, grimvoy
02:19	<robinl1>	boy*
02:19	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: no, there is alternate cd too
02:19	<eXistenZ>	=/
02:19	<Krank>	Using the Flight 5 LiveCD I was never able to get to the desktop. I always got a series of these: hdc: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
02:19	<Krank>	Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 314976. Any idea what this means?
02:19	<Fujitsu>	Krank, a dud CD.
02:19	<eXistenZ>	apokryphos, I downloaded http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
02:19	<rixth>	I want to take the install CD to school and boot it. My idjit IT teacher will throw a tantrum.
02:19	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  were you able to use it with previous ubuntu versions?
02:19	<shriphani>	guys the upgrade is 579 Mb
02:19	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: that's the live+install
02:19	<Fujitsu>	rixth, take a Desktop CD :)
02:19	<grimboy>	Krank, Download another then check the checksum
02:19	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, not necessarily.
02:19	<shriphani>	but it is too big a download for me
02:20	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  what laptop do you have? model?
02:20	<Krank>	Ah. Just make sure the MD5's match on the burn
02:20	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, wait for CDs, then.
02:20	<rixth>	Fujitsu: that's what I have =) I wouldn't actually install it of course.
02:20	<monk_>	Sampizcat, it had the same problem on 5.10 too
02:20	<rambo3>	Krank, use latest cd. i hade same problems on reboot and shutdown
02:20	<Fujitsu>	rixth, why not?
02:20	<shriphani>	so can i upgrade from the cd ?
02:20	<monk_>	Sampizcat, it is a Acer TravelMate 2354LCi
02:20	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:    "Check CD for defects"?
02:20	<capitanplaneta>	ubuntu dvd is just the install cd + live cd on one disk?
02:20	<livingdaylight>	if Dapper was a football team it would win the World Cup
02:20	<Fujitsu>	I wouldn't mind if students at the school where I am an admin installed it :P
02:20	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, you don't say...
02:20	<capitanplaneta>	or does it contain extra stuff?
02:20	<spikeb>	capitanplaneta, and it has both amd64 and x86 i think
02:20	<rixth>	Fujitsu: I'd probably get suspended. They have this weird domain system going on too so I woukdn't be able to get online
02:20	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, Sorry?
02:20	<livingdaylight>	if Dapper was a rock band it would ROCK
02:20	<shriphani>	Fujitsu, can i upgrade from the dapper cd
02:20	<eXistenZ>	apokryphos, are they the same?
02:20	<alleyoopster>	Can anyone tell me if there has been updates between RC and final? I am was running RC and have not seen updates yet?
02:21	<capitanplaneta>	ok then the cd is enough for me
02:21	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, hmm.
02:21	<Fujitsu>	Actually.
02:21	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:  Is that the option I should use ?
02:21	<Krank>	Cool. Bit of a noob, but is dual-booting handled well?
02:21	<Fujitsu>	This is a significant issue...
02:21	<livingdaylight>	Fujitsu; man where is the poetry in ode to Dapper?
02:21	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:  to check md5? or something else?
02:21	<grimboy>	Krank, Yes.
02:21	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: /msg ubotu desktop ; /msg ubotu alternate
02:21	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, yeah, that will do the same as an md5
02:21	<robinl1>	Seveas: What was wrong with the test CD's, then?
02:21	<Seveas>	robinl1, various issues
02:21	<livingdaylight>	GUYS! is there a poetry corner in ode to Dapper?
02:21	<shriphani>	because update manager says 518 MB but i have a download limit
02:21	<Fujitsu>	How are people going to upgrade if they haven't got the capacity to download things?
02:21	<robinl1>	For example?
02:21	<Fujitsu>	As you can't upgrade from the Desktop CD, and that's all that's being shipped...
02:22	<Dreamglider>	44minutes to go
02:22	<shriphani>	awwwwww
02:22	<shriphani>	sheesh
02:22	<Krank>	Any reason to go with the amd64 release over the i386?
02:22	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: I agree, it's an issue
02:22	<rixth>	Krank: if you have an amd64 platform?
02:22	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, I'd say that it was a huge issue!
02:22	<rixth>	Krank: no Flash or Java though
02:22	<shriphani>	so an upgrade is not possible from the cd ?
02:22	<scheuri>	Krank: if you want 64bit sofware on a 64bit processor
02:22	<defunkt>	krank: if you don't have the correct platform, it won't work.
02:22	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, what do you think>?
02:22	<apokryphos>	shriphani: from the altnernate CD it is, yes.
02:22	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: especially forpeople in countries without much broadband access
02:22	<shriphani>	alternate cd ?
02:22	<Frogzoo>	omgawd - 70k with only 2 seeds on the DVD torrent :D
02:22	<defunkt>	the dapper install is so sexy <3
02:22	<shriphani>	tell me apokryphos
02:23	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, this is certainly going to be a large issue.
02:23	<robinl1>	Seveas: what issues?
02:23	<apokryphos>	shriphani: tell you what?
02:23	<Krank>	I've got it, presuming it works with ULI 1695 board
02:23	<shriphani>	about the alternate cd apokryphos
02:23	<fredrich1>	mm...400k/s
02:23	<apokryphos>	shriphani: /msg ubotu alternate
02:23	<ukh>	rixth: no flash, but java is there
02:23	<Fujitsu>	If it's an AMD Athlon 64, it'll work, Krank.
02:23	<Adam->	Alex takes big cock up his ass!
02:23	<apokryphos>	shriphani: you can get it from /topic
02:23	<Tinned_Tuna>	HEya
02:23	<grimboy>	The new rhythmbox is teh suck
02:23	<shriphani>	ok
02:23	<Tinned_Tuna>	oops, sorry
02:23	<goteki>	anyone knows how I can enable widescreen support in ubuntu?
02:23	<Krank>	Cool
02:23	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: Personally I think shipit should have a choice of CDs
02:23	<defunkt>	howdy
02:23	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:  crumbs, the CD is valid :P
02:23	<shriphani>	so i can do it with the text installer ?
02:23	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, it'd need to...
02:23	<Tinned_Tuna>	how do I perform an upgrade through apt?
02:24	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, that's how you /have/ to do it.
02:24	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: i.e. you can order alternate instead of desktop...
02:24	<rixth>	Oh! New Rhythmbox, awesome. The best feature they ever added was built in Last.fm support. And the Queued Songs sidebar was cool too.
02:24	<apokryphos>	ack, wrong person
02:24	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, weird.
02:24	<shriphani>	ok Fujitsu is it being shipped ?
02:24	<Fujitsu>	Tinned_Tuna, modify your sources.list, then apt-get update, then apt-get dist-upgrade.
02:24	<apokryphos>	hm, left
02:24	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, not at the moment.
02:24	<Tinned_Tuna>	hmm ok
=== jamie is now known as Grunt
02:24	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: I have a feeling this will come up on the mailing lists in the next few days
02:24	<Fujitsu>	However, this issue needs to be brought up with somebody important.
02:24	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, it'd better.

02:25	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, im out of ideas, im pretty new to this too, but i had a similar problem with 5.10 and that was the issue.
02:25	<rixth>	Hmm, it needs to default to dapper now.

02:26	<goteki>	fujitsu: 6600gt
02:26	<robinl1>	whaddaya mean?
02:26	<Fujitsu>	goteki, aha...
02:26	<fredrich1>	Fujitsu, yes and no...ive seen game forum servers go down from releases, but it's the first time i've seen a linux distro forum almost go down from the load
02:26	<Fujitsu>	I don't have Nvidia experience.
02:26	<shriphani>	or carry out the download after a few boots ?
02:26	<Fujitsu>	fredrich1, Ubuntu forums are very good...
02:27	<goteki>	hmm
02:27	<shriphani>	man this has left me depressed
02:27	<Fujitsu>	*not very good.
=== Nookie is now known as ___
02:27	<livingdaylight>	i can feel the Ubuntu-mexian wave coming on!
02:27	<fredrich1>	Fujitsu, what i mean is, that the rush and the pressure is more than a linux distro upgrade usually garners
02:27	<sybariten>	can someone make an educated guess on when the forums will be back to a normal state?
=== ___ is now known as Nookie
02:27	<Fujitsu>	fredrich1, yes. This /is/ Dapper.
02:27	<sybariten>	or is this all due to overpopulation only
02:27	<Fujitsu>	sybariten, once everybody gives up...
02:27	<Spaceraver>	a fujitus siemens amilo model m52174 should run ubuntu good right??
02:27	<Verithrax>	Too many 'omg lols dapper is the roxx0r posts'?
02:27	<Fujitsu>	sybariten, probably just overpopulation.
02:27	<thoreauputic>	sybariten: the latter I think
02:28	<noodle>	how do i reclaim my firefox icon.. was about to read the forum post before it died :(
02:28	<Whoopie>	Hi, I have a question regarding package patches: what are these relibtoolize patches for?
02:28	<Fujitsu>	Spaceraver, thanks for not pinging me :) Typos can be useful some times...
02:28	<bliss_>	hi
02:28	<wheelswitch>	noodle, just use easyubuntu
02:28	<Fujitsu>	And yes, Spaceraver, it should run fine.
02:28	<fiendskull9>	hey
02:28	<shriphani>	ok guys any ideas when the alternate cd is coming out
02:28	<fiendskull9>	whats the command to update from breezy to dap.?
02:28	<alleyoopster>	goteki: most likely you will need to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, this will reconfigure the screen. Be sure to back up xorg.conf first
02:28	<grimboy>	!tell noodle about easyubuntu
02:28	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, it was released over 3 hours ago.
02:28	<Fujitsu>	fiendskull9, read the topic.

02:28	<noodle>	ok thx

02:29	<bliss_>	whats the command line to upgrade from 5-10 server with fluxbox to 6.06 server with fluxbox?
02:29	<thoreauputic>	bliss_: erm, your fluxbox will be upgraded automatically
02:29	<thoreauputic>	bliss_: unless you compiled it or something
02:30	<wheelswitch>	i rekon xirc tab completion should be related to who posted last.
02:30	<SunTzuTech>	bliss_: fix /etc/apt/sources.list to get the dapper upgrade, then do an apt-get update and a apt-get dist-upgrade
02:30	<wheelswitch>	*xchat even
02:30	<Grunt>	well seeing as there's no parties in birmingham I think i will have to go down to the pub and drunk with my friends under the guise of ubuntu launch party ;-)

02:30	<wycats>	Is there a way to get boot-admin back into ubuntu?
02:30	<Tinned_Tuna>	hehe :)
02:31	<Fujitsu>	wycats, install it?
02:31	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, you deserve it :)

02:32	<siccness>	dbglt, kind of.
02:32	<Fujitsu>	!doesn't work
02:32	<ubotu>	Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day?  Does it want more money?  Is it on IRC all the time?  Please be specific!  Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
02:32	<bliss_>	thoreauputic; thanks for support
02:32	<dbglt>	fglrxinfo still shows that I am using Mesa, even though I have followed all the steps prescribed
02:32	<dooglus>	SunTzuTech: sudo sed -i s/breezy/dapper/ /etc/apt/sources.list
02:32	<siccness>	Oh, maybe not then.

02:33	<Frogzoo>	Hmmmm: 90kB/s :D
02:33	<Tinned_Tuna>	:p
02:33	<grimboy>	Hmmmm, azureus is a bit heavy for a background application.
02:33	<dbglt>	I followed the instructiosn under the heading: Install instructions for Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake)
02:33	<Hmmmm>	Frogzoo, well im on a 512K connection, so i'll be happy with the 45K that im getting
02:33	<dbglt>	(on the wiki)
02:33	<bliss_>	Tinned_Tuna: how's it going?
02:33	<dbglt>	then tried removing it as is specified in the troubleshooting section
02:33	<Frogzoo>	Hmmmm: yup, sounds good
02:34	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: why do you need the alternate iso to upgrade?  there are packages on the desktop iso too...
02:34	<sybariten>	damn i know there are some pedagogical threads on the forum on how to set up the best locales system for sweden
02:34	<dbglt>	there don't seem to be any errors in my Xorg.log either
02:34	<Fujitsu>	dooglus, no there are not!
02:34	<Chousuke>	hmm.
02:34	<robinl1>	Can somebody tell me what the issues of the .pool test CD's were?
02:34	<dxdemetriou>	the update-manager will have later the upgrate to Dapper, or for each stable release upgrade must be used the -d?
02:34	<Chousuke>	Dapper looks pretty sleek
02:34	<Hmmmm>	well i'll leave for the day. will have dapper waiting to be deployed on 15 machines toimorrow morning...
02:34	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, no. General pre-release issues!
02:34	<Chousuke>	having a weird problem though.
02:34	<sybariten>	Chousuke: dapper? never heard of it.
02:35	<Tinned_Tuna>	go go big-pipe server!
02:35	<grimboy>	Chousuke, it looks slightly less like diarrah, yes.
02:35	<Fujitsu>	sybariten, Ubuntu 6.06.
02:35	<Frogzoo>	!tell cef about torrent
02:35	<SunTzuTech>	bliss_: grr.  I can't find the sources.list you need now  (it used to be on the wiki)
02:35	<sybariten>	Fujitsu: oh, i must have missed that
02:35	<Chousuke>	when I enable Finnish keyboard layout, keys from A to Z stop working
02:35	<Prestidigita>	Hi, im a newbie. can anyone tell me how to install opera on ubuntu ?
02:35	<wycats>	Is there a clean upgrade from Dapper Beta to Dapper full?
02:35	<grimboy>	!tell sybariten to be quiet
02:35	<flodine>	anyone use the alternate install cd i need help
02:35	<wheelswitch>	cef, yeah, 2 seeds
02:35	<dooglus>	SunTzuTech: just run the command I gave you just now
02:35	<Frogzoo>	cef: I got 2 seeds & 230 peers :D
02:35	<dooglus>	SunTzuTech: sudo sed -i s/breezy/dapper/ /etc/apt/sources.list
02:35	<wheelswitch>	cef, dont worry, it will come
02:36	<Fujitsu>	wycats, just apt-get dist-upgrade.
02:36	<grimboy>	!tell sybariten to be quiet
02:36	<Fujitsu>	grimboy, that was uncalled for.
02:36	<SunTzuTech>	dooglus: I'm already on 6.06.  I was telling bliss what he needed to change to get dapper upgraded.
02:36	<robinl1>	Prestidigita: sudo apt-get install opera, but first enable the universe and multiverse, there's instructions on that in the wiki and in the bot.
02:36	<grimboy>	Fujitsu, hehe
02:36	<cef>	wheelswitch: hehe yeah, just checking
02:36	<muszek>	Prestidigita: download the package from opera.com and then sudo dpkg -i name_of_the_package.deb
02:36	<igorzolnikov>	how can i read ntfs?
02:36	<fredrich1>	does gl games work even if youre running xgl?
02:37	<bliss_>	SunTzuTech: yep thanks maybe its changed?
02:37	<grimboy>	sybariten, A wet chocolate fish is traditional
02:37	<flodine>	if you use the alternate cd why dont it ask for a user name and pasword when installing
02:37	<wheelswitch>	cef, tomorrow it should be more like 1000 seeds, 2 peers
02:37	<Kronoz>	fredrich1, i've heard not but i'm not sure
02:37	<Fujitsu>	igorzolnikov, the installer should automagically mount them.
02:37	<sshrdp>	anybody tried new ati driver on dapper? i get "[fglrx]  ... could not register entrypoint for ..." error
02:37	<Fujitsu>	flodine, it should...
02:37	<livingdaylight>	WoaH! another Ubuntu-Mexican Wave makes its way around the World. Yea!
02:37	<Kronoz>	sshrdp, i don't think ati have made xorg 7 drivers yet
02:37	<wheelswitch>	was the 5.10 launch as big of an event as this?
02:38	<Fujitsu>	wheelswitch, not quite.
02:38	<wycats>	It says I have 0 upgrades; does that mean the updates already happened automatically?
02:38	<robinl1>	I love Dapper's default look.
02:38	<wycats>	There were a bunch of updates last night that I accepted
02:38	<Fujitsu>	wycats, probably.
02:38	<bliss_>	dooglus: do you have the line i need to but in my sources to update to 6.06 server please?
02:38	<Fujitsu>	wycats, that's it, then.
02:38	<tubbie>	installing win xp pro. hope it  install correctly :)
02:38	<igorzolnikov>	how can i write ntfs?
02:38	<aLPHa_LeaK>	 g'day
02:38	<tubbie>	I mean in Qemu
02:38	<Fujitsu>	igorzolnikov, you can't.
02:38	<Fujitsu>	tubbie, phew.
02:38	<dbglt>	ok, just went through the xorg log, and I get: (II) fglrx(0): DRIScreenInit done (EE) fglrx(0): Hardware already been locked. - it then reverts to only 2d and not 3d acceleration, as it can't initialise DRI
02:38	<robinl1>	.. holy shit
02:38	<wycats>	Will it continue providing the updates automatically as they are released?
02:38	<dbglt>	any ideas what I could do to fix this up?
02:38	<rambo3>	!tell igorzolnikov about ntfs
02:38	<robinl1>	i look into the theme dialog, and HOLY MOTHER those are MUCH themes!
02:39	<Kronoz>	igorzolnikov, it can be done but it isn't really safe
02:39	<Fujitsu>	wycats, yes.
02:39	<kspath>	robinl1: Please keep your religion out of the channel
02:39	<wycats>	cool
02:39	<sybariten>	igorzolnikov: you can write to FAT but NTFS support is more kinda experimental, i believe
02:39	<livingdaylight>	Guys! once i've upgraded to Dapper from Breezy (10minutes away) will i have Dapper default looks?
02:39	<robinl1>	lol
02:39	<wycats>	so I won't need to do apt-get ...
02:39	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, is this surprising?
02:39	<robinl1>	Yes.
02:39	<Verithrax>	Aaagh.
02:39	<Nookie>	!ntfs
02:39	<Verithrax>	Apt died on me.
02:39	<ubotu>	to automatically mount your NTFS partition: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions there is no write support for ntfs that is safe. <!winfstab>

02:45	<grimboy>	!doesn't work
02:45	<ubotu>	Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day?  Does it want more money?  Is it on IRC all the time?  Please be specific!  Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
02:45	<holycow>	snoops, same here
02:45	<holycow>	hung up the laptop
02:45	<Fujitsu>	holycow, you sure it's valid?
02:45	<ompaul>	holycow, check the md5 sum of that you downloaded
02:45	<snoops>	I mean, when it said it was installing..in the messages it mentioned grub..
02:45	<fredrich1>	um...does aiglx work better with games ans whatnot? or does it hog gpu functionality like xgl?
02:45	<snoops>	but there's no sign of it
02:45	<jpatota>	snoops, can you modify your boot.ini in windows?
02:45	<flodine>	Fujitsu text is command line right
02:45	<snoops>	yep
02:45	<rambo3>	guess forums are overloaded
02:45	<jpatota>	snoops, or did you want to use the grub loader
02:46	<Fujitsu>	flodine, not really.
02:46	<snoops>	I would have liked to use the grub boot loader
02:46	<jpatota>	snoops, actually its probably better to use grub
02:46	<ompaul>	holycow, if the imag e  has a different md5sum then it is broken in some way regrab
02:46	<Fujitsu>	flodine, OEM is just a modified text installation.
02:46	<snoops>	but I would have also liked to have set a boot partition
02:46	<DrNickRiviera>	anyone here got experience with noflushd and journaling filesystems?
02:46	<holycow>	ompaul, *hmm*k
02:46	<n00tz>	what's the quickest way to get GDM set back to my Login Manager? I installed KDM no hitch, but I think I like GDM better
02:46	<snoops>	since I had a free 700meg space just for it
02:46	<Fujitsu>	jpatota, you can't use the Windows bootloader to boot Linux.
02:46	<ompaul>	holycow, :-)
02:46	<Fujitsu>	n00tz, sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm, and select gdm.
02:46	<aftertaf>	n00tz, apt-get remove kdm && apt-get install gdm
02:46	<YogSothoth>	Hi!

03:03	<snoops>	ugh
03:03	<heanol>	i've never had much luck with grub so i blamed it on grub

03:05	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell sybariten -about language
03:05	<holycow>	thoreauputic, totally, i had loads of machines that couldn't automount cds or mount floppies

03:05	<bliss_>	gnomefreak: from the list at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 which is appliable to upgrade from 5-10 server to 6.06 server there are two src sections?
03:05	<dooglus>	snoops: did you try using lilo instead of grub?  I've never managed to get grub to work.
03:05	<LinuxJones>	sybariten, there are rules in the channel please try to obey them.
03:05	<sybariten>	livingdaylight: nothing, its just that there are 1000 people here and if a lot of them just wanna say that they wanna throw a party or something, it may be a good idea to split people between the ubuntu chan and the ubuntu-offtopic chan .. just an idea
03:05	<tanek>	i hardly touch it and it considers that a double tap, plus the acceleration is so god damn annoying
03:05	<snoops>	I don't want to screw with this hdd too much dooglus
03:05	<thoreauputic>	holycow: hmm - OK, I didn't see that here, but then I have only a small home network
03:05	<livingdaylight>	sybariten, this is a christian ubuntu channel, hehehe...Re:offtopic? thhis is happy Dapper day, everyone is allowed to let it hang out a bit
03:05	<gnomefreak>	bliss_: those are extra repos they aide in building stuff
03:05	<tuxtheslacker>	are there any known problems with the linux usb drivers, and linux? because this thing struggles with reading/using SUB devices.
03:06	<snoops>	because I would bloody HATE to have to reinstall applications on my xp install
03:06	<thoreauputic>	holycow: oh, yes, floppies were a problem - that I remember
03:06	<sybariten>	livingdaylight: yeah yeah, i guess youre right
03:06	<heanol>	dooglus, how the heck do you use lilo with the graphical installer?
03:06	<Paradoxx>	hmm, will there be a party here?
03:06	<Kholerabb1>	Whats this about Desktop and Server cds, is desktop a combination of LiveCD and installation CD??
03:06	<kahuna_>	Hi.Can I upgrade by soing s/breezy/dapper, then apt-get update && apt-get dift-upgrade?

03:06	<thoreauputic>	kahuna_: except for the typo, yes :)
03:06	<Mirv>	ling=link
03:06	<snoops>	dooglus..right well the graphical installer does not ask you to install grub, or ask you to specify the boot partition
03:07	<tanek>	wierd... mine does not work good at all :(
03:07	<snoops>	so.. major frustration for me
03:07	<holycow>	thoreauputic, if i dist upgraded the entire 200 machines ... i would of been seriously *effed* ... i can't complain about free really it simply could of been terrible
03:07	<livingdaylight>	sybariten: well i went to ubuntu+1 but it was dead. Hey, you're ok, you know? where is your party at? i might come and crash, hehe  ;)
03:07	<grimboy>	Wow, the new ubuntu.com is sexy
03:07	<kahuna_>	Any issues with breezy->dapper or will I be all set after the dist-upgrade?

03:07	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; yea! you just noticed? Its smoooooooth
03:07	<h3sp4wn>	tuxtheslacker: Linux usb2 code is not very good (generally) especially on flaky hardware does it work using 1.1 in the bios ?
03:07	<bliss_>	gnomefreak: so its just the deb http  sections for 6.06 server?
03:07	<thoreauputic>	holycow: I imagine so - were the bugs squashed fairly fast after release?
03:07	<snoops>	dooglus most definitely has
03:07	<heanol>	snoops, please tell me if you solve it somehow.
03:07	<sybariten>	livingdaylight: hehe, no party here, i just want a global keyboard layout that works in X aswell as console, then i might take a shot of Baileys or something

03:08	<dooglus>	grimboy: you think that's sexy?  do you fancy the 'support' guy?
03:08	<heanol>	can i boot up my installed system from the install/live cd? like using it as a rescue disc? :P
03:08	<snoops>	consider I'm not willing to mess about with this hdd
03:08	<Frogzoo>	!tell Most_Wanted about torrent
03:08	<Most_Wanted>	!tell everybody to stop telling !
03:08	<snoops>	considering*
03:08	<livingdaylight>	sybariten; hahaha, doesn't seem to much to ask for
03:08	<holycow>	thoreauputic, they werent squashed at all actually.  the bugs were moved to dapper for fixing ...
03:08	<tuxtheslacker>	h3sp4wn, what do you mean using 1.1 in the bios?
03:08	<heanol>	snoops, well i did and made my windows unbootable, it sucked :) hehe
03:08	<kahuna_>	Thanks.
03:08	<tuxtheslacker>	h3sp4wn, can I turn 2.0 off, and use 2.0 devices?
03:08	<Most_Wanted>	i have one Frogzoo
03:08	<thoreauputic>	holycow: hmm :-(
03:08	<snoops>	heanol - that's exactly the kind of thing I couldn't afford to do right now

03:09	<gnomefreak>	bliss_: the src repos are fine you dont _need_ them but handy to have
03:09	<kahuna_>	Update-manager doesn't tell me there's an upgrade available. odd.
03:09	<Hattori>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 this one is good to upgrade to 6.06 too?

03:09	<sybariten>	LinuxJones: sure there are rules... i've just never seen anyone being offended on irc by the word "bitch" before. It means female dog or something and its even turned into a verb these days ("hes always the first to bitch").
03:09	<ubotu>	_mason: I haven't a clue, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
03:09	<Paradoxx>	Frogzoo: thx much, thats what i was actually looking for
03:09	<kahuna_>	But I do it the "old way" anyway
03:09	<holycow>	thoreauputic, in other words, i am expecticng similar this time around ... teams tend to develop quirks like that
03:09	<kimo>	kahuna_: update it first
03:09	<Frogzoo>	Paradoxx: cool, yw
03:09	<grimboy>	dooglus, I meant it looked maccy with the widescreens everywhere, but you obviouly consider the support guy to be something
03:09	<kspath>	_mason: /msg ubotu opengl
03:09	<Fee^>	is the 6.06 LTS == the release? i've noticed system update doesn't pick anything up

03:10	<Frogzoo>	!tell Most_Wanted about torrent
03:10	<h3sp4wn>	tuxtheslacker: You can (they are backwards compatible) kmod-usb2 is pretty buggy but usb-uhci and usb-ohci seem to be more reliable
03:10	<bliss_>	gnomefreak: all i need is to upgrade from 5-10 server to 6.06 sever
03:10	<dooglus>	grimboy: I was kind of getting aroused by the new design until his image loaded, and then I was back with my old friend Mr. Floppy.
03:10	<snoops>	oh yeah, 6.06 totally doesn't support 1920x1200 res..I'm gonna have to add that myself
03:10	<kimo>	Fee^: apt-get update && apt-get install update-manager
03:10	<livingdaylight>	gnomefreak; after i've upgraded to Dapper, will i have to take care of repos, or is that handled during the upgrade/update section automatically?
03:10	<Fee^>	kimo: thankee :)
03:10	<tuxtheslacker>	h3sp4wn, I have usb-uhci installed.
03:10	<Hattori>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 this one is good to upgrade to 6.06 too?
03:10	<gnomefreak>	bliss_: than keep your sources.list file and change the words breezy to dapper
03:10	<MistaED>	snoops: 1920x1200 works here
03:11	<snoops>	MistaED this is with the live cd?
03:11	<tuxtheslacker>	anyone know if a restart will fix this unhandeled page fault on read access to  0x003c002f at address 0x7bebe9fa
03:11	<tuxtheslacker>	?
03:11	<tuxtheslacker>	^^ is this a ram error?
03:11	<h3sp4wn>	tuxtheslacker: Have you ehci_hcd loaded also ?
03:11	<snoops>	because I haven't been able to get into the installed machine - because of the lack of grub in the install
03:11	<sybariten>	LinuxJones: ok, well, didnt know that. There should be a blacklist or something somewhere. For non-americans (or non-brits, etc) its sometimes hard to estimate if the word "blabla" will be offensive or not (and ofcourse one always tries to use it anyhow)
03:11	<Frogzoo>	!tell kimo about torrent
03:11	<grimboy>	dooglus, It's kind of disturbing that you'd rather be a technophile than a admit that the support guy is sexy.
03:11	<livingdaylight>	gnomefreak; man, i'm counting on you?  :o
03:11	<MistaED>	snoops: nah an install, got nvidia video?
03:11	<Most_Wanted>	my download is going with 6.6 KB/sec lol
03:11	<RandolphCarter>	snoops: do you have a Ubuntu live-cd lying around?
03:11	<gnomefreak>	livingdaylight: for what?
03:11	<snoops>	yep MistaED
03:11	<Frogzoo>	Most_Wanted: 90kB/s here :D
03:12	<dooglus>	grimboy: what does technophile mean again?
03:12	<tuxtheslacker>	h3sp4wn, yup.
03:12	<snoops>	RandolphCarter I've got the 6.06 desktop cd - which has a live cd
03:12	<Most_Wanted>	will take 30 days before i have ubuntu 6.06 ROFLMAOPIMP
03:12	<snoops>	well, I mean which is a live cd/graphical installer
03:12	<sybariten>	are there any other packages related to "locale" that will affect how my terminal behaves? uh, i mean, what kbd layout it uses
03:12	<kimo>	tuxtheslacker: try to enable ECC in BIOS
03:12	<livingdaylight>	gnomefreak; oh, you missed my post to you. After my dapper upgrade/ update do i need to take care of repos?
03:12	<Frogzoo>	Most_Wanted: if the repos don't actually fall over
03:12	<RandolphCarter>	snoops: okay, you can use that to boot, mount the partitions you installed Ubuntu to in a terminal and then 'chroot' into it
03:12	<MistaED>	snoops: the nv driver only supports up to 1280x1024 for me, i needed the prop driver to get 1920x1200
03:12	<Jowi>	h3sp4wn: yeah, i'm trying to update and install some stuff and the main fr.archive servers are damn slow. then I remembered the date :)
03:12	<fatalblu>	so how is it?
03:12	<Most_Wanted>	lol Frogzoo
03:12	<livingdaylight>	gnomefreak; or is that handled automatically?
03:12	<tuxtheslacker>	killefiz, what would that do?
03:12	<Paradoxx>	wow, who are ubuntu teams hosts
03:12	<gnomefreak>	livingdaylight: no you shouldnt have to
03:12	<livingdaylight>	gnomefreak; Cooool
03:12	<RandolphCarter>	snoops: then you can run grub-install and grub-update
03:13	<sybariten>	or maybe i should restart X before i complain ...  is a ctrl-bckspace enough on ubuntu? to really exit X ?
03:13	<GNAM>	CDs of Shipit program are RW? :P
03:13	<rackerz>	When automatix closes, it asks me if I want to save the sources.list that is uses, should i let it save?
03:13	<kimo>	sybariten: ctrl + alt + <-
03:13	<grimboy>	dooglus, Recently, the idea of technophilia is also used in connection with a behavior which realizes forms of sexual deviance with the help of the computer and the Internet.
03:13	<kahuna_>	Congrats on keeping up w/ the demand guys.
03:13	<livingdaylight>	gnomefreak; by the way you Rock. Did anyone ever tell you that? All the help you've given to me personally and hundreds others like me here ... solid gold man...
03:13	<dooglus>	grimboy: either way, my point is that he isn't.  he's all lumpy and funny looking.  I can see they're trying to show they've got geeks who can help out, but is he the best they could find for the photoshoot?
03:13	<h3sp4wn>	tuxtheslacker: Just try forcing it to usb 1.1 (see motherboard manual) test it then
03:13	<Most_Wanted>	hmm, when are the shipping cd's coming ?
03:13	<snoops>	uhh.. I really don't know my linux terminal commands..so mounting a few drives I can do..
03:13	<Fee^>	update-manager is already the newest version.
03:13	<rackerz>	When automatix closes, it asks me if I want to save the sources.list that is uses, should i let it save?
03:13	<Fee^>	o.O
03:13	<snoops>	but the whole chrooting stuff I haven't done
03:13	<Fee^>	kimo
03:14	<RandolphCarter>	snoops: that's about it, to chroot just type "chroot /path/you/mounted/drives"
03:14	<gnomefreak>	Most_Wanted: you can order them they will be shipped soona nd you will get them 4-6 weeks
03:14	<h3sp4wn>	!schroot

03:15	<snoops>	umm..the windows floppy boot disk?
03:15	<theine>	!automatix
03:15	<ubotu>	methinks automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.

03:15	<Fee^>	kimo: yeah.. wondering if it is actually an upgrade.. the 5/23(5) LTS to what came out today
03:15	<grimboy>	dooglus, Why are you intent on being mean about that guy?
03:15	<rackerz>	can somebody tell me if it's wise to save the sources.list automatix uses?
03:15	<Paradoxx>	anyone know of some good imaging software? I want to backup a windows installation and install ubuntu
03:15	<RandolphCarter>	snoops: :P then get a bootcd, Sysrescuecd has FreeDOS on it, the fdisk from there can repair it
03:15	<ivoks>	dr_willis: ah, update-manager -d is much nicer :)
03:15	<Fee^>	ok, so that answers my question, i've been dist-upgrading every night
03:15	<GnarusLeo>	Hi, can anyone please descrive how I update my kubuntu breezy to newest dapper? I still want my kde and all :) Anyone?
03:16	<dr_willis>	rackerz:  its not wise to use automatix at ALL.
03:16	<kimo>	Fee^: just "apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade -y'
03:16	<theine>	rackerz: it's wise to not use automatix at all
03:16	<dooglus>	grimboy: I'm not.  Just someone said the page was sexy.  I'm terribly sorry if that's you.
03:16	<ompaul>	antibios, it may work well on your machine we have seen it break often on many machines - we see on an on going basis, and the only solution for some people is to reinstall that is not a stable application
03:16	<rackerz>	how come? it's works well on Dapper apprently.
03:16	<Most_Wanted>	uh update manager ?
03:16	<theine>	dr_willis: :)
03:16	<Frogzoo_away>	Paradoxx: acronis true image is the best imo - then nortong ghost next
03:16	<snoops>	RandolphCarter.. thanks I think I'll just wait for a fix to come out - like a different cd
03:16	<dr_willis>	rackerz:  100's of reasons. Just say no.
03:16	<rackerz>	so i shouldn't save the sources.list automatix uses?
03:16	<antibios>	razerz if you save the source list then the programs that you donwloaded will be able to be updated... bt then you will have to update them each time you do apt-get update
03:16	<snoops>	I need to be able to use my xp install when I wake up, and the last thing I need is a screwed mbr
03:17	<antibios>	thanks ompaul
03:17	<dr_willis>	rackerz:  i would be doing a reinstall if you used automatix.
03:17	<Paradoxx>	Frogzoo_away: was hoping for somthing free, but i'll guess i can do with that
03:17	<livingdaylight>	rackerz; some say autocatix is problematic
03:17	<kimo>	Paradoxx: for a FOSS, try mondorescue
03:17	<RandolphCarter>	snoops: hmm, okay :/ it's really only five minutes work if you fancy trying it though, it comes in handy to know how to repair systems too :)
03:17	<GnarusLeo>	Hi, can anyone please descrive how I update my kubuntu breezy to newest dapper? I still want my kde and all :) Anyone?
03:17	<Jowi>	GnarusLeo: /msg ubotu upgrade

03:17	<Most_Wanted>	uh update manager GnarlyBob ?
03:17	<dr_willis>	automatix is very very poorly done in manmy ways
03:17	<antibios>	dr_willis what has been breaking in automatrix
03:17	<grimboy>	dooglus, Not me, but being a support guy for ubuntu would be alright compared to other support.
03:17	<snoops>	yep..but not at 1:14am on a work night RandolphCarter :)

03:17	<tuxtheslacker>	can someone tell me what an unhandeled page eeror at (add random sector here) means?
03:17	<ubotu>	I heard automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
03:17	<tuxtheslacker>	well, it's the same sector every time...
03:17	<grimboy>	!easyubuntu
03:17	<ubotu>	hmm... easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
03:17	<tuxtheslacker>	but it just started breaking.

03:19	<rackerz>	Does easyubuntu do what automatix does? i mean does it install similar things without changing settings?
03:19	<dr_willis>	ive notiuced that installing suns java from the shell dont work. since it wants to pop up some eula agreement.
03:19	<RandolphCarter>	dr_willis: sudo dpkg-reconfigure debconf
03:19	<grimboy>	rackerz, Yes, pretty much
03:19	<RandolphCarter>	dr_willis: select 'Dialog' and 'High', then try reinstalling sun-java

03:22	<AJ004>	huh?
03:22	<theine>	AJ004: you only need update-manager if you upgrade to a new major releae
03:22	<AJ004>	should i ignore the warnings.warn?
03:22	<rackerz>	If I don't use the sources.list from automatix will the programs it install not be able to be updated?
03:22	<theine>	AJ004: don't worry about it
03:23	<feisar>	hmm
03:23	<tuxtheslacker>	what happens if I cancel an upgrade with dist-upgrade?
03:23	<spikeb>	Celestar, then you're stuck with the ncurses installer
03:23	<traveller>	hm...can anyone tell me how i can enable YUY2 overlay using fglrx driver? tvtime works with the ati driver but not fglrx
03:23	<tuxtheslacker>	er I mean update-manager?
03:23	<AJ004>	theine i was at rc1
03:23	<RandolphCarter>	tuxtheslacker: there be dragons
=== amd64 is now known as amd-64
03:23	<rackerz>	If I don't use the sources.list from automatix will the programs it install not be able to be updated?
03:23	<LinuxJones>	tuxmaniac, unless it started installing packages...nothing
03:23	<javiolo>	is there flash por ppc ?
03:23	<thoreauputic>	tuxtheslacker: don't go there
03:23	<AJ004>	theine doesnt look like any updates for final
03:23	<javiolo>	is there flash for ppc ?
03:23	<grimboy>	If I'm upgrading and it goes all weird will sudo apt-get upgrade save me?
03:23	<ompaul>	rackerz, well we see the fall out and are willing in particular to point to log files of irc that show the problems people have had with it - as it overwrites config files if it can't restore the originals it breaks badly and that can be a real problem for a new user.
03:23	<AJ004>	unless they came out yesterday
03:23	<tuxtheslacker>	RandolphCarter, I'm unfortunately being serious.... I am getting 14 k/s :-(
03:23	<Fee^>	kimo: apparently i'm current...it doesn't want to upgrade anything else :)
03:23	<AJ004>	and i didnt notice
03:23	<theine>	AJ004: then you can just do "sudo apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade" or use synaptic
03:23	<Xymor>	dvd == server + desktop, right?
03:23	<grimboy>	javiolo, try crossover office or wine.
03:23	<RandolphCarter>	tuxtheslacker: ahh, if it's only downloading, you should be okay
03:24	<Celestar>	spikeb: guess I gotta be patient then :)
03:24	<rackerz>	ompual, thanks :)
03:24	<Jowi>	tuxtheslacker: depends on how far it has gone. if it has not installed anything yet it should be safe to cancel it.
03:24	<fatalblu>	ubuntu came out! how fabulous!
03:24	<LinuxJones>	Xymor, yes
03:24	<Xymor>	ok thanks
03:24	<rackerz>	looks like i'll be back later in 10 minutes then. install time!
03:24	<tuxtheslacker>	how can I cancel it? hahahahaha!
03:24	<dr_willis>	rackerz:  now you see one of the issues with automatix.  its not by the actual ubuntu guys.. and now you are asking support questions for a script that they dident make. and  they suggest to not use. :P Gets on their nerves after a while.
03:24	<theine>	AJ004: there were very few updates in the last couple of days
03:24	<javiolo>	grimboy I though that wine dont run over ppc, is that right ?
03:24	<tuxtheslacker>	should I just let it go?
03:24	<LinuxJones>	Xymor, type live at options for the live cd
03:24	<Celestar>	hm
03:24	<thoreauputic>	tuxtheslacker: interrupting an upgradeis kind of dangerous unless you know the install phase hasn't started yet
03:24	<tuxtheslacker>	or is this form of an upgrade unsafe?
03:24	<kimo>	Fee^: yeah ... updates stopped I think 1.5 days ago
03:24	<ompaul>	rackerz, when the software should just work - but its tackled badly, have a look at /msg ubotu easyubuntu but your much better off with the docs from help.ubuntu.com or the wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
03:24	<grimboy>	javiolo, sorry I'm completely ignorant of other arcs
03:24	<michaels>	I just upgraded to Dapper and my mouse scrollwheel stopped working.
03:24	<tuxtheslacker>	thoreauputic, it hasn't.

03:25	<Paradoxx>	Is it possible in a SAFE way to resize a windows partition after install?...... I neeed to free p space for ubuntu
03:25	<kspath>	tubbie: quit screwing with xgl?
03:25	<Fee^>	kimo: its a big day :)
03:25	<thoreauputic>	tuxtheslacker: well, if you were using apt-get it would be safe to interrupt the download - not sure about the new method
03:25	<michaels>	help me. the upgrade killed my mouse scrollwheel. what do I do?
03:25	<pio_>	Hi

03:25	<joelbryan>	anyone, does the install CD would be removed with only the installable Live CD?
03:25	<Ng>	Paradoxx: you could boot into a live CD and run parted, but no resizing is ever 100% safe, you should always take a backup first
03:25	<jsestri2>	Paradoxx: partion magic will do it
03:25	<drayen>	i've managed to funk up my apache2.conf and wanted to know where i could find a clean copy (nb, doing a --purge re-install isnt an option)

03:25	<Celestar>	:P
03:25	<pio_>	on my ubuntu
03:26	<amd-64>	Why ubuntu 6.06 doesn't have an option to install boot loader (Grub) ?
03:26	<theine>	Paradoxx: the safest way would probably be to use partition magic under windoes
03:26	<Ng>	drayen: download the .deb and extract it with dpkg-deb
03:26	<LinuxJones>	michaels, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg only change mouse options.
03:26	<thoreauputic>	michaels:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose your mous options
03:26	<tuxtheslacker>	how do i cancel this update-magnager?
03:26	<pio_>	my openoffice menu widget and toolbart hide
03:26	<theine>	amd-64: it'll do that anyway
03:26	<thoreauputic>	LinuxJones: too fast :)
03:26	<Tinned_Tuna>	bah, I think I'll just reinstall from a CD when it's downloaded
03:26	<amd-64>	theine: too bad !
03:26	<LinuxJones>	Xymor, live will boot into the livecd not a network install
03:26	<fatalblu>	where do I get bonzai buddy?
03:26	<vader>	see you peoples later when the text slows down to where I can read it lol
03:27	<michaels>	LinuxJones, thoreauputic, my xorg.conf is set right, should I still run that?
03:27	<adolson>	fatalblu: lol
03:27	<tubbie>	kspath, I odn't even know if it is Xgl at all
03:27	<tuxtheslacker>	fatalblu, I hope that was a joke....
03:27	<thoreauputic>	vader: heh
03:27	<drayen>	Ng. ahhh cheers
03:27	<theine>	amd-64: why? would you like to use lilo?

03:27	<Celestar>	damnit
03:27	<Cas>	fatalblu: you'll need wine for that
03:27	<jsestri2>	what do you have to do to get to the latest release if you were already running dapper? apt-get update/apt-get upgrade?
03:27	<LinuxJones>	*nicotine
03:27	<Celestar>	I'm stuck at the keyboard selection

03:33	<thoreauputic>	michaels: close any other instances of apt or aptitude or synaptic etc
03:33	<theine>	tuxtheslacker: have a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesCliHowto and substitute "dapper" for "breezy"
03:33	<fatalblu>	they should name the one after etch 'Frisky Ferret'
03:33	<meddlepal>	ah schweet
03:33	<kspath>	!upgrade
03:33	<ubotu>	hmm... upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.

03:35	<grimboy>	phos-phoros, why do I get a sudden urge to stab you with a fork?
03:35	<Madeye>	MacSlow, ohh thank you I didnt know that
03:35	<tuxtheslacker>	I should just blow the system away and see if that isn't the better thing to do :-P
03:36	<tuxtheslacker>	can someone send me a screenshot of the stock desktop?

03:38	<mauti>	theine: try ctrl+alt+(plus on your keypad)
03:38	<thoreauputic>	michaels: sounds like a lock file that needs removing
03:38	<scheuri>	Mark_: try burning it with 8x or max 16x
03:38	<Celestar>	lucasvo: somewhere near 250kbyte here
03:38	<thefish>	Ocult: ??? mistype?
03:38	<michaels>	thoreauputic: still the same problem there
03:38	<tuxtheslacker>	MacSlow, Just so long as there's a 1.5 series I'm happy :-) and once it updates :-P
03:38	<Ocult>	[theine] : all be strange..
03:38	<cef>	hrm.. the torrents are going well. over 683 GiB downloaded according to the tracker.. though the tracker seems to have stopped answering web requests for me
03:38	<lucasvo>	Celestar: well I am at home
03:38	<charlotte>	:)
03:38	<Mark_>	Jowi, kestas, scheuri: i cannot imagine, im doing it with a kubuntu cd though, but i think it doesnt matter
03:38	<Ocult>	[theine] : in breezy that work good
03:38	<jordan>	Seveas, sorry - I got dropped for a while... what were you saying about updating freenx for the dapper libs?
03:38	<[HUN] Big_T>	hi ubuntu users! :)
03:38	<Celestar>	lucasvo: 10 GBps pipe :)
03:38	<theine>	Ocult: try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and hit enter until you reach the screen where you can change the screen resolution
03:38	<MacSlow>	tuxtheslacker, I constantly updated my system form badger to dapper starting some months ago
03:38	<lucasvo>	Celestar: cool
03:38	<scheuri>	charlotte: time to convert your landlord...:)
=== junming_ is now known as junming
03:38	<Celestar>	lucasvo: pity the workstation is stuck with 100MBps :P
03:38	<charlotte>	haha i doubt he will
03:39	<kork>	the ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso torrent isn't in good shape...
=== junming is now known as gunmyeong
03:39	<Jowi>	Mark_: if you're using cdrw media, i would even test at x4. my cdburner act up sometimes
03:39	<thoreauputic>	michaels: OK - I'm not sure which file is the lock file for that but I think that is likely the problem
03:39	<cef>	ahh. 695GiB now
03:39	<jordan>	Seveas, I added the dapper repo, then did an update
03:39	<charlotte>	i only use windows for photoshop now
03:39	<Mark_>	Jowi, kestas, scheuri: i will try a ubuntu cd and burn it slower... should i try another burning program?
=== jordan is now known as jdmpike
03:39	<Celestar>	lol
03:39	<theine>	Ocult: try the dpkg-reconfigure thing and i'm fairly sure the gnome tool will then work as expected too
03:39	<Celestar>	I'm downloading at 2.5MB/sec :o
03:39	<michaels>	thoreauputic: what is a lock file?
03:39	<Ocult>	[theine] : it work in livecd ?
03:39	<cef>	kork: same here.. there isn't enough seeds currently.. but it's getting better
03:39	<scheuri>	Mark_: try burning it slower first before changing programm
03:39	<tuxtheslacker>	charlotte, now I only use windows for my webcam I just bought :-(. that thing ticks me off like no other!
03:39	<SV>	i don't see the dapper upgrade in my update manger
03:39	<leoncio>	the torrent is bad
03:39	<theine>	Ocult: oh, you're using the live CD?
03:39	<Mark_>	scheuri, okay
03:39	<scheuri>	Mark_: and use CD-R instaed of CD-RW
03:39	<Fabricio>	ola....alguem pode me ajudar
03:40	<Malith>	Ubuntu
03:40	<kspath>	!br
03:40	<leoncio>	hola Fabricio
03:40	<ubotu>	Por favor use #ubuntu-br (/j #ubuntu-br) para ajuda em portugues. Obrigada.
03:40	<thoreauputic>	michaels: it's a file that stops a process interfering - in this case with dpkg
03:40	<grimboy>	Celestar, That's actually 1000 times faster than me.
03:40	<JoeyB2>	I'm getting 110kB/s down with the torrent.. 2.5 more hours  :P
03:40	<mauti>	Celestar: good for you. Here it is like 64kpbs
03:40	<Mark_>	scheuri, yes i use imation CD-R
03:40	<scheuri>	Mark_: ah, okay
03:40	<thoreauputic>	michaels: a safety lock if you like
03:40	<Celestar>	mauti: what version? i386 ?
03:40	<SV>	someone ?
03:40	<tuxtheslacker>	leoncio, what torrent is bad?
03:40	<[HUN] Big_T>	can anyone help me with my ubuntu install? i get an error message when the system root is mounting: cdrom_pc_intr: the drive appears confused
03:40	<michaels>	thoreauputic: got it
03:40	<scheuri>	kspath: that was spanish, wasnt it?
03:40	<Ocult>	((theine)): if i install the same problem happen
03:40	<Madeye>	MacSlow, Do you know where in the CD these images live ? the only images I found the splash .pcx and debian logo
03:40	<Ocult>	Hey, theine: i just cant understand why in breezy i dont have this problem
03:40	<Mark_>	scheuri, isnt there a way to check the cd from windows?
03:40	<charlotte>	hey i had a problem with installing ubuntu to this machine with the iso and installed it as data and was ok but my other machine had a problem with both and i want to put kubuntu on the other one and i've chosen the one for for lower ram to see if it'll work ok. i was just wondering if anyone had tried to install kubuntu on a slow machine and suceeded?
03:40	<javiolo>	scheuri no
03:40	<kork>	cef: you can actually watch how the data gets from the 2 seeds to the faster peers :)
03:40	<leoncio>	tuxmaniac, the torrent that is in www.ubuntu.com
03:40	<Malith>	Mi ubuntu es bueno. Gracias amigo.
03:41	<Mark_>	scheuri, like doing a md5 on iso
03:41	<MacSlow>	Madeye, in the "Examples" directory on the desktop once you booted into the live-cd
03:41	<cef>	kork: hehe
03:41	<rixxon>	i broke ubuntu :(
03:41	<tuxtheslacker>	leoncio, I got mine from somewhere else :-(
03:41	<theine>	Ocult: i'm sure it'll work one you install Ubuntu to hard disk
03:41	<kork>	34,5% now
03:41	<grimboy>	rixxon, me too.
03:41	<michaels>	thoreauputic: well, after the upgrade crashed, I restarted and it seemed pretty much stuck on shutting down. all I had was my wallpaper and mouse cursor and no computer activity indicated on the lights. so I pressed the power button. may have interfered with something there.
03:41	<tuxtheslacker>	leoncio, I'm still downloading it though.
03:41	<SV>	i don't see the new upgrade in my update manger,what to do ?
03:41	<mauti>	Celestar: it is Pentium 4 356 MB RAM
03:41	<rixxon>	'Software index is broken'
03:41	<scheuri>	Mark_: there might be...but bruning it slower very likely will solve the problem...as long as md5 of your iso you download is fine, it should be okay
03:41	<Ocult>	[theine] : but u know this problem i said ?
03:41	<cef>	leoncio: there's a lot of torrents there. which image?
03:41	<scheuri>	javiolo...sorry then
03:41	<thoreauputic>	michaels: oops
03:41	<mauti>	Celestar: how about yours?
03:41	<grimboy>	rixxon, hey, you were on last night.
03:41	<rixxon>	i can't apt-get or install automatic updates
03:41	<theine>	Ocult: no, but i have a feeling
03:41	<Madeye>	MacSlow, ah I don't have the live
03:41	<Celestar>	mauti: ok I've started seeding i386 as well.
03:41	<Mark_>	scheuri, ah okay thx, so did this problem already occur before?
03:41	<rixxon>	grimboy: probably? im always here. i have no life. :(
03:41	<Celestar>	:)
03:41	<Madeye>	MacSlow, if you got the live can you send em to me ?
03:41	<leoncio>	cef, i386, ubuntu desktop
03:41	<grimboy>	heh
03:41	<[HUN] Big_T>	can anyone help me with my ubuntu install? i get an error message when the system root is mounting: cdrom_pc_intr: the drive appears confused
03:42	<thoreauputic>	michaels: I fear you may have some corrupted file system problems therer
03:42	<thoreauputic>	*there
03:42	<MacSlow>	Madeye, take a look in some of the OpenOffice documents... there are several... somewhere there is a a non-bitmap-based ubuntu-logo with the typical catch-phrase afaik
03:42	<Celestar>	mauti: UltraSparc T1 here
03:42	<SV>	????
03:42	<scheuri>	Mark_: yes...sort of...it is always an issue with CD-Rs and burning them with high speed (and then using them on different CD-devs)
03:42	<MacSlow>	Madeye, hm... got to mount it one sec
03:42	<mauti>	Celestar: thanks but i am downloading ISOs. Bittorrents are taking twice the time :(
03:42	<cef>	leoncio: what was wrong with it? refused connections or ?
03:42	<Malith>	FUCK UBUNTU IN THE ASS
03:42	<michaels>	thoreauputic: so what do I do?
03:42	<grimboy>	What do I do when I start up and there's no gnome
03:42	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell mauti about torrent
03:42	<theine>	Ocult: really, don't worry about, if it still doesn't work after you installed Ubuntu, and I'm sure there are many people who'll be able to help you resolving the problem
03:42	<grimboy>	Malin``,  I agree
03:42	<lucasvo>	!ops
03:42	<ubotu>	Help! lilo, hedgemage, lamont, Keybuk, jdub, Amaranth, tritium, ajmitch, crimsun, ogra, CarlK, Seveas, Burgundavia, apokryphos, thoreauputic, nalioth, Madpilot, ompaul, rob, Hobbsee or gnomefreak!
03:42	<leoncio>	cef, yes
03:42	<Celestar>	mauti: they shouldn't
03:43	<Hobbsee>	lovely.
03:43	<Krank>	I am still can't boot from the desktop cd, getting that "hdc: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
03:43	<Mark_>	scheuri, ah great, i burned it with 48x so maybe that is it
03:43	<Krank>	Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 156349" MD5's match
03:43	<Ocult>	theine: thanks
03:43	<scheuri>	Malith: thanks for your input...now watch your language
03:43	<Celestar>	can't I tell the installer that do NOT want to create a user?
03:43	<Frogzoo_away>	mauti: 100kB/s here :D
03:43	<thoreauputic>	michaels: try  sudo shutdown -R -H now ( should fsck the disk on reboot)
03:43	<Madeye>	MacSlow, Thank you dude
03:43	<scheuri>	Mark_: I guess it was...quite likely...
03:43	<leoncio>	cef, ok sorry now is ok
03:43	<cef>	leoncio: just try again.. it's damn busy.. over 1500 downloaders
03:43	<ompaul>	scheuri, hes is gone - lonnnng gone
03:43	<scheuri>	ompaul....arrr...I am too slow....
03:43	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell leoncio about torrent
03:43	<michaels>	thoreauputic: what exactly does that do?
03:43	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell scheuri about torrent
03:43	<thoreauputic>	michaels: aargh - wrong sorry
03:43	<charlotte>	has anyone installed kubuntu successfully on 128mb ram and pentium 2?
03:44	<Cass>	talking about fsck, how do you stop ubuntu fscking the drive on boot every 30 reboots ..  that just annoys me
03:44	<ompaul>	thoreauputic, -F
03:44	<tuxtheslacker>	how cna I go back on my repo listings?
03:44	<jdmpike>	charlotte, it will run great!
03:44	<CrippsFX>	how do I change the login screen?
03:44	<krazykit>	charlotte: it'd work, but it would be kinda slow.  you'd really want 256 for a happy time, at least
03:44	<thoreauputic>	michaels:  shutdown -r -F now
03:44	<tuxtheslacker>	I need to go back to breezy....
03:44	<Corey_>	hey guys
03:44	<cef>	leoncio: no probs.. it happens.. quite a load on the torrent tracker
03:44	<ompaul>	Cass, you don't want to do that
03:44	<Corey_>	some of my games arent working when i try to load them
03:44	<charlotte>	its for an old machine
03:44	<grimboy>	charlotte, try #kbuntu
03:44	<Cass>	ompaul, yes i do
03:44	<thoreauputic>	ompaul: thanks - just checked it in the man :)
03:44	<rixth>	How can I recover rm'd stuff from ext3?
03:44	<Intangir>	omg, its dapper day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
03:44	<charlotte>	im running ubuntu on this one but it's a powerful pc
03:44	<jdmpike>	charlotte, turn off the flashy stuff
03:44	<ak7>	charlotte, xubuntu might work better...
03:44	<Corey_>	like.. tuxracer normally worked but now its not..
03:44	<michaels>	thoreauputic: is "now" part of that command?
03:44	<grimboy>	charlotte, you'll need the traditional install cd
03:44	<PreZWork>	dapper day? heh
03:44	<krazykit>	rixth: you don't, really.
03:44	<rixxon>	would a dist-upgrade take down if on RC?
03:44	<Celestar>	*slowly* I do not want to create a user account :S
03:44	<Trae>	heh
03:44	<Intangir>	#ubuntu+1 is gone ;)
03:44	<erez>	hi, if i were using dapper beta, all i need to do now in order to upgrade is update && upgrade && dist-upgrade , right?
03:44	<thoreauputic>	michaels: yes
03:45	<scheuri>	Cass: I secnd that...you DONT want to avoid that
03:45	<michaels>	thoreauputic: and what does it do?
03:45	<charlotte>	im downloading the kubuntu for 192mb ram or lower
03:45	<Intangir>	does anyone know of a good CVS integration for nautilus?
03:45	<Trae>	Intangir, yeah, I was wondering the same thing, I was like, where is my #ubuntu+1 tab... heh.
03:45	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell erez about torrent
03:45	<ompaul>	Intangir, that is because dapper is release
03:45	<grimboy>	charlotte, You'd be better off with icewm or xfce
03:45	<thoreauputic>	michaels: it tells the system to do it right now, and reboot (r ) and fsck ( F)
03:45	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell charlotte about torrent
03:45	<Cass>	scheuri, and again, yes i do ..  is there someting i am missing apart from the fsck just annoying me
03:45	<charlotte>	right...
03:45	<kork>	rix/wc
03:45	<rixth>	krazykit, they were not overwritten. I heard somone earlier ask the same question and they were told about a program.
03:45	<Intangir>	Trae: ya i was like.. i dont remember leaving the channel ;)
03:45	<kork>	lol
03:45	<thoreauputic>	michaels: checks your filesystem
03:45	<Trae>	heh
03:45	<harobed_>	where is "mc" in dapper ?
03:45	<claes>	erez, Yes
03:45	<ubuntu>	hello?
03:45	<gnomefreak>	!mc
03:45	<gumpish>	Is there any sort of big picture emerging from this chaos? Are clean installs good but upgrades broken? Vice versa?
03:45	<ubotu>	Did you get hit by a windmill? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, gnomefreak
03:45	<Intangir>	does #ubuntu forward to #ubuntu-1 ;)
03:45	<scheuri>	Cass: for clarification...are you aware what fsck is doing?
03:45	<wheelswitch>	why is Frogzoo_away telling everyone about torrent?
03:45	<ubuntu>	any body?
03:45	<kspath>	harobed_: apt-cache search mc
03:45	<michaels>	thoreauputic: cool. will do. thanks.
03:45	<grimboy>	ubuntu,  hey
03:46	<erez>	claes: thanks
03:46	<gnomefreak>	Intangir: other way around
03:46	<ubuntu>	ubuntu is perfect!
03:46	<Celestar>	bah
03:46	<Intangir>	no i say minus 1 hehe
03:46	<matti>	;p
03:46	<Frogzoo_away>	wheelswitch: cos the repos are gonna die, that's why
03:46	<Celestar>	ktorrent is acting up with seeding :S
03:46	<Cass>	scheuri, yes i know exccatly wehat fsck is doing .. i just dont need it every 30 boots
03:46	<charlotte>	im loving the new ubuntu
03:46	<harobed_>	kspath, no found
03:46	<thoreauputic>	ubuntu: modest too, evidently ;)
03:46	<grimboy>	ubuntu, a bit full of yourself today.
03:46	<Intangir>	ubuntu rules ;)
03:46	<ubuntu>	-h
03:46	<ubuntu>	help
03:46	<rixxon>	hokey i fixed my broken ubuntu... by reading the error description! :D - coming from windows used to ignoring tose
03:46	<Intangir>	ive been waiting for this day for quite a while hehe
03:46	<gnomefreak>	Intangir: #ubuntu+1 is closed dapper support is in here now
03:46	<Corey_>	E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
03:46	<Corey_>	E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
03:46	<charlotte>	i just wanted to play about with kubuntu without using live cd haha
03:46	<Intangir>	its like a holiday
03:46	<grimboy>	ubuntu, /help
03:46	<scheuri>	Cass: okay...there is a way to manipulate that...but I must admit that I forgot...it is in the settings for your filesystem...
03:46	<gnomefreak>	Corey_: use sudo
03:46	<krazykit>	Corey_: sudo
03:46	<Corey_>	i did
03:46	<thoreauputic>	!tell Corey_ about root
03:46	<Corey_>	 sudo apt-get  update && apt-get  upgrade && apt-get  dist-upgrade
03:47	<rixxon>	Corey_: sudo apt-get ...
03:47	<scheuri>	Cass: I am sure that google will help you there...
03:47	<squid>	#ubuntu-mx
03:47	<grimboy>	ubuntu, or !topic
03:47	<kspath>	harobed_: mc - midnight commander - a powerful file manager
03:47	<hypnox>	Cass, if every 30 boots is a problem, you reboot too much. Edit your /etc/fstab to change the frequency
03:47	<rixxon>	Corey_: sudo before each command
03:47	<thoreauputic>	Corey_: you missed the second sudo
03:47	<thoreauputic>	:)
03:47	<Corey_>	ok
03:47	<gnomefreak>	Corey_: you have to use sudo in each command
03:47	<scheuri>	hypnox: is it in fstab? not really AFAIK
03:47	<cef>	getting quite sick of the few bugs I find in nautilus. hopefully they'll be gone from the version in dapper (upgrading on the weekend as I need this pc to work tomorrow)
03:47	<rixxon>	thoreauputic: and the third
03:47	<rixth>	It was just a few 200mb videos anyywa
03:47	<thoreauputic>	rixxon: indeed :)
03:47	<grimboy>	Corey_, or sudo -sH
03:47	<gnomefreak>	Corey_: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade is all you need
03:47	<rixxon>	:)
03:47	<RandolphCarter>	Corey_: sudo bash -c 'apt-get  update && apt-get  upgrade && apt-get  dist-upgrade', or put a sudo before each command
03:47	<ompaul>	Cass, you do, however I will tell you that I really resist your request, so all I am willing to show you is that the information you want is in "man fstab"
03:47	<Some_Person>	Hey, I'm still using Breezy, and I can't get usplash to display. Is there a script file on ubuntu that runs on startup that I can add "usplash" to/
03:47	<Corey_>	alright thanks
03:47	<rixxon>	grimboy: sudo -i
03:47	<Cass>	hypnox, its a laptop i use, it reboot at least twice a day
03:47	<charlotte>	my galeon browser kept crashing
03:47	<Corey_>	some of my games arent working now
03:47	<Corey_>	why is that
03:47	<kspath>	harobed_: mc is part of universe
03:47	<grimboy>	rixxon, oops.
03:48	<charlotte>	seems fine with this beta version of the new one
03:48	<Corey_>	they wont start up
03:48	<charlotte>	i dunno
03:48	<charlotte>	maybe its my pc
03:48	<Celestar>	ktorrent seems kinda crappy
03:48	<Some_Person>	By the way, I use LILO (and don't try to make me switch)
03:48	<sladen>	Some_Person: sudo apt-get update -u $(uname -r)
03:48	<cef>	Corey_: which games? can you give examples?
03:48	<Corey_>	tuxracer
03:48	<Corey_>	scorched 3D
03:48	<Corey_>	torcs
03:48	<Corey_>	trigga
03:48	<Corey_>	blender 3D
03:48	<grimboy>	Some_Person, but lilo doesn't begin with a g.
03:49	<thoreauputic>	!enter
03:49	<ubotu>	Please don't use the "enter" key as punctuation! It spams the channel and is annoying.
03:49	<ompaul>	!enter
03:49	<Some_Person>	samuel@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update -u $(uname -r)
03:49	<Cass>	ompaul, dont worry about me .. i will find the answer, i am a experianced solaris Sysadmin and i know whats what, i dont need a fsck on boot when i quickly want to get on line .. thanks for the clue about fstab, i just dodnt see the setting for this inside
03:49	<sladen>	RandolphCarter: the correct way is to put sudo before each.  Please use that method if you're showing other peple
03:49	<tuxtheslacker>	can someone PLEASE tell me how exactly I would go about setting my repos back to breezy repos?
03:49	<thoreauputic>	Corey_: stop it with the enter key, please
03:49	<Some_Person>	E: The update command takes no arguments
03:49	<cef>	Corey_: all use OpenGL. Most likely you haven't got OpenGL working or your video card doesn't support it. what video card do you have?
03:49	<jbroome>	tuxtheslacker: replace the word dapper with breezy
03:49	<kspath>	 /ignore Corey_
03:49	<RandolphCarter>	sladen: I think your definition of 'correct' is a bit absolute, but okay
03:49	<hypnox>	Cass my bad, have a look at man tune2fs
03:49	<sladen>	tuxtheslacker: edit /etc/apt/sources.list   change all the 'dapper' into 'breezy'
03:49	<Celestar>	lol
03:49	<ompaul>	Cass, its in the man page about "column 6 afik"
03:49	<jbroome>	tuxtheslacker: in /etc/apt/sources.list
03:49	<sladen>	RandolphCarter: thanks
03:49	<Celestar>	25 leechers on i386-desktop :P
03:49	<AJ004>	i just installed easyubuntu
03:49	<samu>	What's the difference between sudo and gksudo?
03:49	<AJ004>	now which features should i enable?
03:49	<Some_Person>	so?
03:49	<jbroome>	i just took a shower

03:50	<WAHa_06x36>	all right, what's the deal with upgrading to Dapper through the Update Manager?
03:50	<kspath>	samu: two letters?
03:50	<sladen>	samu: one puts up a graphical password box
03:50	<gnomefreak>	samu: gksudo is used for running gui apps
03:50	<mauti>	Celestar: I am not one of them. ;)
03:50	<grimboy>	samu: gksudo is pretty
03:50	<WAHa_06x36>	I can't get this to work at all.

03:50	<thoreauputic>	!plf
03:50	<ubotu>	well, plf is the Penguin Liberation Front, see http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf , mainly for i386 users with some packages for ppc
03:50	<AJ004>	cass should i enable all repositories?
03:50	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: and I do have the newest Update Manager.
03:50	<Some_Person>	E: The update command takes no arguments
03:50	<grimboy>	Corey_, Drivers?
03:50	<Cass>	AJ004, i do
03:50	<Corey_>	im not sure possibly
03:50	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: where do you click check?  what applications aren't working?
03:50	<czambran81f>	Does anybody know how come there are no updatesm and the final version already came out?
03:50	<Cass>	AJ004,  well for what i need
03:51	<Corey_>	I need one for an ati card where do i get ?
03:51	<Corey_>	its an old ati card

03:51	<krazykit>	Corey_: what model?
03:51	<grimboy>	!tell Corey_ about ati
03:51	<Some_Person>	is there a script file in Breezy that runs on startup that I can add "usplash" to?
03:51	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: in the Update Manager, as explained on the wiki.
03:51	<charlotte>	oooh i need one for my ati too
03:51	<hypnox>	bliss_ apt-get dist-upgrade
03:51	<Celestar>	mauti: you should be :P
03:51	<sladen>	Some_Person: it's run from initramfs.  add 'usplash' to the kernel command line
03:51	<grimboy>	!tell charlotte about ati
03:51	<sladen>	Some_Person: or just  sudo apt-get install usplash

03:51	<tuxtheslacker>	thanks all!
03:52	<viS_>	hi,  i just installed ubuntu 6.06 and i'm getting these weird notification sounds sometimes.
03:52	<krazykit>	Corey_ and charlotte, in general, you use the open source "ati" driver for a 9200 and below, and the fglrx driver for the cards newer than that
03:52	<claes>	Cass, Is it the 30 reboot fsck you want to change? Then look at: man tune2fs
03:52	<Some_Person>	what is initramfs?
03:52	<viS_>	anyone know why?
03:52	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: I'm still missing the big picture.  what is happening that shouldn't happen?
03:52	<Corey_>	ok well its a 320M
03:52	<Some_Person>	usplash is installed
03:52	<charlotte>	nice one!
03:52	<krazykit>	!tell krazykit about ati
03:52	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: that should upgrade my system, or so the wiki claims.
03:52	<Cass>	claes, cheers, im reading that just now
03:52	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: in reality, nothing happens.
03:52	<Some_Person>	samuel@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install usplash
03:52	<kspath>	viS_: It wants more attention.

03:53	<spafbnerf>	however, doens't work w init scripts
03:53	<grimboy>	thoreauputic, that was a bit strong.

03:53	<grimboy>	oh
03:53	<nekromaan>	hello, is there a kernel-headers for 2.6.15-23-386, cause i cant find it with apt-get?
03:53	<hypnox>	hmm, update-manager should be updated so it offers dapper
03:54	<spafbnerf>	and wireless-key restricted s:mykey
03:54	<thoreauputic>	grimboy: the chan is very busy atm too
03:54	<spafbnerf>	??? wtf ? :(
03:54	<viS_>	kspath: it doesn't show anything graphical
03:54	<AJ004>	tuxtheslacker:  And www.blogger.com crashes the system
03:54	<Reinhart>	is it just me or is ubuntuforums.org very flaky today?
03:54	<claes>	Running update-manager -d remote over an ssh tunnel. Hope this will work. :-)
03:54	<tuxtheslacker>	AJ004, it does?
03:54	<tuxtheslacker>	ahahahhaha! I have to check that out!
03:54	<Some_Person>	now, what file do i add "usplash" to?
03:54	<Celestar>	hm
03:54	<krazykit>	thoreauputic: as an op, do you have some control over ubotu?  because there should really be a note that the 9200 cards and below can use the open source driver
03:54	<AJ004>	tuxtheslacker yep
03:54	<sladen>	Some_Person: /boot/grub/menu.lst
03:54	<AJ004>	tuxtheslacker ill try it after easyubuntu, could be the fonts
03:54	<sladen>	Some_Person: really, it should be installed by default
03:54	<Corey_>	guys I have an old ati card that is shared memory
03:54	<thoreauputic>	krazykit: you cn change ubotu factoids
03:54	<Corey_>	I need a driver for it..
03:55	<nclife>	woot, ubuntu dapper drake is already out?

03:55	<thoreauputic>	krazykit: do it in /msg though
03:55	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: grep dapper /etc/apt/sources.list
03:55	<Corey_>	where do i put that thoe ?
03:55	<nclife>	heh
03:55	<krazykit>	right, thoreauputic kspath and h3sp4wn, i'll put that in the notes :-)
03:55	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: nothing.
03:55	<Some_Person>	But I use LILO
03:55	<Madeye>	MacSlow, jad@syntux.net please :D
03:56	<czambran81f>	With the finally release did any additional updated came out???
03:56	<Lyst9>	...
03:56	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: edit that file.  change all the  'breezy'  into  'dapper'    then  sudo apt-get update
03:56	<Celestar>	installation is SLOW :(
03:56	<Some_Person>	How do you add usplash to LILO?
03:56	<highvoltage>	isn't there a better way to do it these days?
03:56	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: great, I installed Ubuntu so I wouldn't have to edit files in /etc/.

03:57	<Some_Person>	Hello?
03:57	<SeMBoY>	;(
03:57	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: It's not that scary or dangerous.
03:57	<Lynoure>	SeMBoY: it no longer exists, new one will be at some point
03:57	<runes>	is there a way to modify the adduser so that it creates subfolders under the user folder?
03:57	<void^>	gah. each and every time i use gnome i find myself disabling the gnome-terminal keybindings that collide with irssi.
03:57	<Hobbsee>	SeMBoY: because it doesnt exit yet.
03:57	<Celestar>	how would the world work without torrents?
03:57	<WAHa_06x36>	Lynoure: it's annoying. I'm a programmer, I can do this shit, I just don't WANT to.
03:57	<Some_Person>	It redirects here
03:57	<rixxon>	SeMBoY: because dapper is now officially released
03:57	<kspath>	runes: write a script that uses adduser?
03:58	<SeMBoY>	okei
03:58	<SeMBoY>	?
03:58	<hypnox>	runes yes, see /etc/adduser.conf

03:58	<ubotu>	Please watch your language. We try to be nice and help but some of us don't like to see such things on our screen.
03:58	<Some_Person>	HOW DO I ADD USPLASH TO lilo?
03:58	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: the instructions in that document, *should* install a new breezy version of update-manager;  which then should allow you to upgrade the distribution to dapper.  did you restart the application after install the new version of update-manager?
03:58	<thoreauputic>	void^: yeah, it's annoying
03:58	<kspath>	runes: write your own version of adduser?
03:58	<SeMBoY>	but i have ubuntu dapper ;( so no one will help here?
03:58	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: several times.
03:58	<sladen>	Some_Person: put  'usplash'  on the end of the arguments
03:58	<chapium>	X is showing a wave pattern on my screen, causing sections every other inch to appear slightly blurred.  Anyone know how to fix this?
03:58	<tuxtheslacker>	can someone please tell me if unhandled page fault is a bad ram error? or what it is?
03:58	<MacSlow>	Madeye, do you want the whole "Example"-directory? About 19 MBytes uncompressed.
03:58	<Cass>	SeMBoY, dapper is in final now, this is the chan for hep
03:58	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: what version of update-manager do you have installed?   Can you find out the version?
03:58	<thoreauputic>	void^: I use rxvt or urxvt with irssi
03:58	<ompaul>	SeMBoY, dapper is now released, therefore this channel is now for dapper
03:58	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: :) I guess it's a matter of opinion. One thing I loved aout debian was that I could edit all the configuration files
03:58	<Some_Person>	sladen: where?
03:58	<runes>	hypnox and kspath I don't know what to put in the adduser.conf so that it grabs the user $ and creates the folder
03:58	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: I also checked with synaptic that I've got the newest version.
03:59	<Some_Person>	sladen: what file?
03:59	<SeMBoY>	Nice
03:59	<Madeye>	MacSlow,  if you can upload it somewhere it would be cool dude
03:59	<hypnox>	runes then you'll have to read the documentation, wotn you
03:59	<WAHa_06x36>	Lynoure: isn't the point of Ubuntu that you don't need to do that?
03:59	<Madeye>	MacSlow,  but my email wont handle such big attachment
03:59	<void^>	thoreauputic: yes, i use urxvt usually :)
03:59	<Yorgos>	hi

03:59	<SeMBoY>	hello i have tvout problem -i have setup in xorg.conf -but does not show on tv
03:59	<runes>	hypnox I did it only shows the default names it creates based on what adduser looks for
03:59	<Doso>	http://krunch.servebeer.com/~krunch/vrac/pics/ubuntu-logo.jpg (:
03:59	<kspath>	people do not seem to want to read manual pages, it is so hard...
03:59	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: I'm newish to ubuntu (less than 3 months), so I'm not sure what the point is, yet.
03:59	<Some_Person>	sladen: what file do I add "usplash" to?
04:00	<Corey_>	how do i configure what driver i have for my video card ?
04:00	<sudomania4>	in firestarter, what is the difference between allowing connections and allowing services?
04:00	<Yorgos>	anyone knows?
04:00	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: I think e.g. Suse is was more gui happy than Ubuntu but that is based on the situation with Suse years ago
04:00	<hypnox>	WAHa_06x36 try later, update-manager may work by then.
04:00	<ompaul>	!webcam

04:02	<snoops>	hey I tried again
04:02	<ompaul>	gil, pop a card in it and type >sudo fdisk -l<< and see if it reads it
04:02	<snoops>	still absolutely no go
04:02	<MacSlow>	Madeye, takes a few moments to upload... stand-by.
04:02	<Lynoure>	gil: then the card got mounted automatically.

04:03	<eXistenZ>	hello, what's the difference between text and OEM mode
04:03	<jlmr>	i would like to install dapper, but first i want to know how to make the installer leave my MBR alone..
04:03	<kspath>	sudomania4: hint: most services have specific port numbers and some people run "servers"/"daemons"
04:03	<jlmr>	?
04:03	<ompaul>	mauti, so it was said a couple of seconds ago in the channel please msg the bot /msg ubotu paste << that will help a lot
04:03	<hypnox>	runes if you want to do sometihng that isnt supported in adduser then you will have to figure it out some other way i guess
04:03	<mauti>	jlmr: what do you mean, it overwrites the MBR?
04:04	<snoops>	jlmr, it doesn't even seem to touch my MBR.
04:04	<snoops>	which is the problem.
04:04	<jlmr>	im not sure it does, but i dont want it too
04:04	<jlmr>	to*
04:04	<jlmr>	good
04:04	<michaels>	thoreauputic: well, I did that restart and then I could do the reconfigure thingy for x. but I still can't use the scroller to scroll. it works, it can set zoom together with control and all the nice stuff it's supposed to do, except it can't scroll up and down.
04:04	<aperez>	jose
04:04	<jlmr>	so if i install, i can use ntldr to load ubuntu?
04:04	<runes>	hypnox can you suggest a good link to documentation on this aside from the man pages? I tried google but all the links refer to are default config.
04:04	<jlmr>	instead of using GRUB to load windows
04:04	<hypnox>	jlmr if you do not have a boot manager installed then it shouldnt touch your mbr
04:04	<kspath>	runes: write a script that uses adduser and mkdir and chown and chmod and anything else you want
04:04	<Some_Person>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14955 - My lilo.conf - where do i add usplash?
04:04	<speedie>	any recommended utilities for converting flash .swf files into avi files (pref. DivX)
04:04	<chapium>	jlmr: it is possibl
04:05	<eXistenZ>	thoreauputic, what's the difference between text-mode and OEM mode?
04:05	<hypnox>	runes not sure what you're trying to achieve really, so nope
04:05	<snoops>	I didn't think you could use the windows boot manager to boot linux?
04:05	<thoreauputic>	michaels: the option is something like zaxis mapping 4 5 in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
04:05	<bruce89>	oem asks for the users details after install
04:05	<jlmr>	i know, i just wasnt sure what ubunut installer was going to do to MBR
04:05	<jlmr>	snoops, yes you can
04:05	<runes>	hypnox I am trying to get adduser to create a folder /public_html and /graphics for each user created
04:05	<thoreauputic>	eXistenZ: OEM= Original Equipment MAnufacturer ( custom settings etc)
04:05	<michaels>	thoreauputic: I know, I had to mess around with these options a ton when I first started using ubuntu cause I was used to the way I used to use the mouse's side-buttons
04:05	<gnomefreak>	jlmr: it will just install itslef to the mbr
04:05	<hypnox>	runes, ah, put the folders you want created in /etc/skel/
04:06	<Cass>	snoops, yeah you need to dd the first 512bytes of the /boot disk and dump to a file, copy that to windows fs then update boot.ini
04:06	<tolle>	snoops, I've never heard of it. you can point it to a grub loader i guess, but ntldr cant even read most filesystems
04:06	<michaels>	thoreauputic: I have it configured now like I used to
04:06	<jlmr>	gnomefreak, thats not what in want, how do i prevent it :P

04:06	<runes>	hypnox exactly!!!
04:06	<Some_Person>	sladen: u here?
04:06	<claes>	runes, Sorry hypnox allready answered.
04:06	<gnomefreak>	jlmr: you can install grub on the ubuntu partition (the very beginning of it) iirc
04:06	<steko>	old question: anyone has problems with openoffice? I can't go past splash screen
04:07	<dfgas>	why doesn't my update show final is out yet?
04:07	<runes>	hypnox Thank you it's been two days trying to figure that out..I thought skel was for simple configuration files for the desktop not for folders
04:07	<michaels>	thoreauputic: oh, the side buttons don't work any more but I don't use them anymore really so it doesn't matter
04:07	<jlmr>	gnomefreak: how?
04:07	<thoreauputic>	michaels: as far as I know the scrolling is the zaxis mappingthing - but someone else might help you
04:07	<spikeb>	dfgas, probably because the servers are overloaded
04:07	<chapium>	steko, loads fine for me
04:07	<hypnox>	runes it's not smart, it just dumps everything in there into the homedir :)
04:07	<claes>	dfgas, Use update-manager -d
04:07	<thoreauputic>	michaels: I 've never needed to use that
04:07	<RandolphCarter>	michaels: do you have 'Option "ZAxisMapping"  "4 5"' in the mouse section in xorg.conf? (add 'Option "Buttons" "7" too)
04:07	<gnomefreak>	jlmr: whne the choice of where would you like to put grub choose no to the mbr
04:07	<buzzed>	so would the easiest way to update from Breezy, be burning to a CD and then install?
04:07	<Some_Person>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/14955 - my lilo.conf - where do i add usplash?
04:07	<thoreauputic>	michaels: I have a ps2 scroll mouse that Just Works (tm)
04:07	<steko>	chapium, glad to hear that, it worked for me too previously
04:07	<runes>	hypnox Thank you that's exactly what I needed!  Have a great day!
04:07	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell buzzed about upgrade
04:08	<buzzed>	or is the a net install
04:08	<hypnox>	runes no problem
04:08	<Tallia1Kubuntu>	hi there! somebody here uses IRC to download divx movies?
04:08	<claes>	buzzed, sudo update-manager -d
04:08	<RandolphCarter>	michaels: depending on your mouse, you may need ZAxisMapping "6 7" etc.
04:08	<gil>	i cant get it to pick up the card reader at all
04:08	<spikeb>	-d is for bleeding edge
04:08	<gil>	anyone have any ideas...
04:08	<gil>	?
04:08	<RandolphCarter>	michaels: you can run 'xev' from a terminal and use the mouse-wheel over the window to see which buttons you need to map
04:08	<jazzido>	hi everyone i'm getting this "Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz MD5Sum mismatch" in update-manager -d when trying to upgrade to dapper
04:08	<jazzido>	any clues?
04:08	<Tallia1Kubuntu>	hi there! somebody here uses IRC to download divx movies?
04:08	<jlmr>	gnomefreak: thnx, i will install it now :D
04:08	<thoreauputic>	Tallia1Kubuntu: I think you are in the wrong channel
04:08	<snoops>	Okay..I grabbed the 6.06 amd64 desktop iso..booted in it..went through the install..chose the partitions to install to..with xp in the primary master boot partition(the gui installer didn't give me the option to change it). It installed.. never asked for what boot loader I wanted - but it said it installed grub and then said grub was scanning hdd's. Then it asked me to reboot..
04:09	<michaels>	thoreauputic and RandolphCarter, look here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=132384&page=2
04:09	<Cass>	Tallia1Kubuntu, yeah we heard the first time
04:09	<snoops>	I rebooted, and bam..no boot loader
04:09	<melodie>	bye bye
04:09	<dfgas>	claes, alls i had an update for was for pcmcia-cs and that it
04:09	<brainlessbob>	Finally! Dapper Drake :D
04:09	<thoreauputic>	Tallia1Kubuntu: if you persist you will be out of here
04:09	<Tallia1Kubuntu>	okok
04:09	<dfgas>	claes, i am running rc

04:09	<tubbie>	omg. 9 min to finish installing xp in qemu
04:09	<claes>	dfgas, Then you now have released dapper. Have fun!
04:10	<MacSlow>	Madeye, hm... may take a bit longer... currently the upload-speed fluctuates like wild :/
04:10	<Celestar>	STILL installating :S
04:10	<gnomefreak>	dfgas: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
04:10	<michaels>	thoreauputic RandolphCarter: funny, it treats the side buttons as 8 and 9 now.
04:10	<buzzed>	update-manager says i'm upto date
04:10	<snoops>	I'm not that clued up on how the grub boot loader works
04:10	<kspath>	Celestar: You forgot to pay for premium service ?
04:10	<thoreauputic>	Some_Person: presumably on the kernel line ( don't use lilo any more here)
04:10	<snoops>	does it install itself to the /boot partition?
04:10	<LinuxJones>	MacSlow, LowFat is awesome :)
04:10	<thoreauputic>	michaels: your mouse has a mind of its own ;)
04:10	<claes>	buzzed, update-manager -d also says you are up to date?
04:11	<snoops>	and then change the mbr to boot from that first?
04:11	<Madeye>	MacSlow, ah I can understand, maybe I should stop nagging so it gets better lol
04:11	<[HUN] Big_T>	can anyone help me with my ubuntu install? i get an error message when the system root is mounting: cdrom_pc_intr: the drive appears confused
04:11	<Lynoure>	gil: no ideas today, there are some outomount instructions but those are for debian and things should be easier in ubuntu, I assume
04:11	<dfgas>	gnomefreak, heh, intresting shows no updates  :D
04:11	<Celestar>	kspath: lol :P
04:11	<Some_Person>	thoreauputic:where is that?
04:11	<michaels>	thoreauputic: I guess it really is just time to, sniff sniff, get a new mouse.
04:11	<gnomefreak>	dfgas: it shouldnt
04:11	<dfgas>	hmmmm
04:11	<Frog_Racer>	am i able to upgrade 5.10 >	6.06 with out downloading/burmimg the iso

04:12	<hypnox>	Frog_Racer yes, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
04:12	<thoreauputic>	Some_Person: *cough* in lilo.conf look for the line that identifies the kernel you want to boot
04:12	<Medisol>	hola
04:12	<Medisol>	hay alguien q habla en espaol
04:12	<[zero] >	Hey anyone know any good websites which like tell you how to customise ubunut?
04:12	<rackerz>	!easyubuntu
04:12	<MacSlow>	Madeye, at 43% atm
04:12	<ubotu>	I guess easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
04:12	<snowblink>	running on Dapper, but not having much luck with the xgl stuff
04:12	<gnomefreak>	!es
04:12	<ubotu>	Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
04:12	<Some_Person>	thoreauputic: which line?
04:12	<Celestar>	kspath: installation complete
04:12	<dfgas>	gnomefreak, it didn't do a distro upgrade though, as i said i was running rc
04:12	<buzzed>	upgrading now
04:12	<Cas>	!xgl
04:12	<ubotu>	xgl is, like, "XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompositeManager - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/"
04:12	<gnomefreak>	dfgas: you are running final release
04:12	<dfgas>	k
04:12	<snowblink>	thanks Cas
04:13	<[HUN] Big_T>	can anyone help me with my ubuntu install? i get an error message when the system root is mounting: cdrom_pc_intr: the drive appears confused
04:13	<gnomefreak>	dfgas: dist-upgrade doesnt upgrade you to newest release
04:13	<dfgas>	ahhh
04:13	<jazzido>	anyone else getting this? Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz  MD5Sum mismatch

04:14	<kspath>	fatalblu: please do not hit enter so much
04:14	<hypnox>	Egill sudo apt-get install build-essential
04:14	<thoreauputic>	Egill: install build-essential
04:14	<gnomefreak>	Egill: sudo apt-get install build-essential
04:14	<thoreauputic>	heh
04:14	<rackerz>	hey, can somebody confirm for me that it is better to use EasyUbuntu rather than automatix?
04:14	<Egill>	ok, thanks
04:14	<tristanmike>	!automatix
04:14	<grimboy>	!tell fatalblu about enter
04:14	<ubotu>	I heard automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
04:14	<javiolo>	how do I know if my webserv accepts secure ftp ?

04:15	<gnomefreak>	NthDegree: yes
04:15	<grimboy>	yes

04:15	<tristanmike>	NthDegree, for just a bit, till edgy is up and running
04:15	<NthDegree>	i guess i need to do a dist-upgrade then
04:15	<claes>	firedrops, Yes
04:15	<firedrops>	ty

04:17	<Celestar>	4-8GB on the workstations
04:17	<sladen>	Celestar: swap
04:18	<thoreauputic>	fabi: stop, please
04:18	<Ng>	Celestar: swap is still useful
04:18	<Frogzoo>	sk4jvoker: look under /proc for 'swappability' - set it to zero
04:18	<Celestar>	sladen: not on a laptop it just eats battery ...
04:18	<chapium>	jacquesmerde: that would be overkill probably
04:18	<spikeb>	swap does not eat battery
04:18	<Celestar>	damnit
04:18	<claes>	jacquesmerde, You also need to copy the files in /etc/skel to the new users homedir.
04:18	<hypnox>	jacquesmerde yes, but you may want to copy the files out of /etc/skel into your new empty homedir
04:18	<snoops>	voraistos time for a new girl friend!
04:18	<Celestar>	swap accesses the HDD which eats battery :)
04:18	<SurfnKid>	guys how can i disable the sensor limits on boot up?
04:18	<Frogzoo>	best soln for swap eating battery is to set swappability = 0
04:18	<Celestar>	gnah

04:19	<Celestar>	where did the installer install grub to?
04:19	<jacquesmerde>	claes: hypnox, thanks. i want a fresh 6.06, i've made too many stupid changes. is this the ubuntu(TM) way?

04:19	<fabi>	ola esta conectaovoraistos de donde eres
04:19	<sk4jvoker>	 and i need to delete the swap partition
04:19	<Frogzoo>	Celestar: mbr is usually /dev/hda - 1st block
04:19	<chapium>	jacquesmerde: per-program settings are in .folders.  Deleting those would reset some settings on things
04:19	<defunkt>	en ingles por favor

04:19	<crazy_penguin>	a beatifull dapper day for everyone! :)
04:19	<claes>	jacquesmerde, It's the linux way. When you create a user all linux distros copy what's in /etc/skel to that users homedir.
04:19	<hypnox>	rackerz no, restart firefox though

04:23	<Frogzoo>	grimboy: shows what I know
04:23	<jacquesmerde>	claes: what happens if i use nautilus to send my ~ to the "garbage bin", would my computer explode from self-reference?
04:23	<czambrano>	!tell fabi about es
04:23	<grimboy>	jacquesmerde, no, but don't do it anyway
04:24	<sweetnjguy29>	I am re-downloading the iso image now - burned it to CD, but it wouldn't boot for some reason - the cursor bounced all over the screen - figured it was a bad burn or a bad CD -- anyone have similar problems?
04:24	<voraistos>	wow i gat sme strange lag here
04:24	<thoreauputic>	czambran: he's been told about 3 times, and he is now gaged
04:24	<MrKeuner>	why does't update manager already warn me that there is a release?
04:24	<Frogzoo>	sweetnjguy29: probly wrong mouse driver
04:24	<Zoohouse>	Quick question, I remember read a article somewhere that there was a application made by the ubuntu team so that users of ubuntu 5.10 can upgrade to 6.06 without a CD. Did i dream this up?
=== |Element| is now known as |Element|away|
=== daki0267_ is now known as daki0267
04:24	<claes>	jacquesmerde, Nope but all your user config and files you saved would be gone. And the garbage bin is in ~. Hmmm wonder what that would do...
04:24	<jacquesmerde>	grimboy: why not do it? if you dont tell me i'll HAVE to do it. just to see what would happen. the curiousity is toos trong
04:24	<Lukketto>	sweetnjguy29: use the "alternate" iso
04:24	<Celestar>	Media change: please insert the disc labeled
04:24	<Celestar>	 'Ubuntu-Server 6.06 _Dapper Drake_ - Release Candidate sparc (20060524.2)
04:24	<tuxtheslacker>	has anyone here dealt with open x-change?
04:24	<Celestar>	it IS in :S
04:25	<jacquesmerde>	claes: yeah, the garbage is in ~. thats exactly what i meant. tehehe
04:25	<grimboy>	jacquesmerde, No, create a new user.
04:25	<Mark_>	hey i still have problems with the cdrom after burning at 12x.. here is a screen: http://eljefe.hopto.org/ubuntu.jpg
04:25	<claes>	jacquesmerde, Try it. And tell us what happens. :-)
04:25	<grimboy>	jacquesmerde, I have a user just for messing about with stuff.
04:25	<Celestar>	:o
04:25	<Celestar>	bash :S
04:25	<tristanmike>	!tell Zoohouse about upgrade
04:25	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, that's a bad disk
04:26	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, cdrom?

04:26	<sk4jvoker>	i need to delete the swap partition is it safe
04:26	<voraistos>	Mark_, burn @ 4x ;)
04:26	<Frogzoo>	sk4jvoker: sudo swapoff
04:26	<MacSlow>	Madeye, tell me when you're done with downloading it.
04:26	<grimboy>	jacquesmerde, It would probebly remove everything in ~ except the rubbish bin.
04:26	<Hamurabbi>	does the kubuntu dvd contain both the Desktop and the "Server"/"alternate" versions ?
04:26	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, how many hard drives do you have ?
04:26	<andrejkw>	Hey guys
04:26	<andrejkw>	Is the ubuntuforum down for everyone?
04:26	<andrejkw>	Or is it just me?
04:26	<Cass>	sk4jvoker, safe until the apps you run need to page to disk ....
04:26	<snoops>	what's the alternate version
04:27	<grimboy>	andrejkw, yes.
04:27	<snoops>	yes down for me too andrejkw
04:27	<Frogzoo>	Hamurabbi: the DVDs 3gig, so I'm guessing yes
04:27	<grimboy>	andrejkw, but irc is better anyway.
04:27	<Frogzoo>	!tell Hamurabbi about torrent
04:27	<Zoohouse>	Thank you tristanmike
04:27	<Madeye>	MacSlow, you forgot to give me the URL dude :D
04:27	<Celestar>	ok
04:27	<jazzido>	wtf? update-manager now doesn't shows the "a new distribution is available" button
04:27	<Celestar>	step 1) re-enable root
04:27	<jazzido>	and i'm pretty use i didn't upgrade to dapper :)
04:27	<jacquesmerde>	alternative install would still be more reliable than the livecd one, yeah?
04:27	<Frogzoo>	!tell Madeye about torrent
04:27	<claes>	jazzido, update-manager -d
04:27	<MacSlow>	Madeye, I priv.-messaged you it
04:28	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, 1
04:28	<jazzido>	claes: no good. button's not there
04:28	<sweetnjguy29>	zoo:  http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/faqguide-all.html  -- check out the end of the document to upgrade w.o a cd
04:28	<spikeb>	claes, you realise the -d bit is only for updating to bleeding edge, and that in a couple weeks, that will send people to edgy, right?
04:28	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, with some partitions
04:28	<MrKeuner>	why does't update manager already warn me that there is a release?
04:28	<sweetnjguy29>	no -d bit to upgrade
04:28	<jacquesmerde>	i take it when using synaptic to remove an app, there's no way to find out what dependencies i instaleld with it? no log? should i have used aptitude instead?
04:28	<crazy_penguin>	i change the nic in my computer and now i can't make it to be configureted automaticly at boot. why is that? also i modified iftab.
04:29	<jazzido>	perhaps breezy thinks that i already updated? how can i fix that?
04:29	<claes>	jazzido, check /etc/issue
04:29	<Katu>	I really like ubuntu OS and i am new to linux linux but unfortunately, my wireless notebook adapter WPC54G ver 4 not working out with UBUNTU, can anyone please help
04:29	<grimboy>	If I started upgrading yesterday will I get half RC and half official?
04:29	<snoops>	so the alternate install is the text based installer?
04:29	<claes>	spikeb, Yes but not today.
04:29	<Celestar>	AAHH
04:29	<concept10>	over a thousand people in the channel? unreal
04:29	<spikeb>	just a warning
04:29	<jazzido>	claes, Ubuntu 5.10 "Breezy Badger" \n \l
04:29	<Celestar>	does the installer eject the CD?
04:29	<lefty_2nd>	Hi, is it easier to try upgrade a version of Warty on dual boot (thats bit messed up - too much playing not enuff organising) or should I install Dapper from sratch?
04:29	<Celestar>	(during the installation process?)
04:29	<Cass>	katu, i use v5 of that card, you will need to use ndiswrapper
04:29	<zOap_wrk>	To upgrade from breezy to dapper, is the best way to alter 'breezy' to 'dapper' in sources.list and apt-get update / dist-upgrade?
04:29	<rackerz>	can someone tell me why totem can't establish connection to the sound server?
04:29	<Katu>	cass can you please PM me
04:30	<spikeb>	zOap_wrk, the best way is to use the update manager
04:30	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, but would it be necessary to burn the cd again (at 4x)?
04:30	<snoops>	lefty_2nd - I've been finding an issue with dual booting - the boot loader isn't working
04:30	<claes>	jazzido, Strange. Do what zOap_wrk just said then.
04:30	<tristanmike>	lefty_2nd, reinstall, you would have to upgrade to Hoary, then Breezy, then Dapper, you can't do a straight upgrade, it's best to install from scratch
04:30	<h3sp4wn>	zOap_wrk: You might want to try a faster mirror
04:30	<grimboy>	rackerz, bacause sound is broken on dapper.
04:30	<viS_>	how do I install the java sdk 5.0 on ubuntu 6.06 ?
04:30	<Greg2>	hello all
04:30	<Greg2>	wow... i've never been on a channel with over 1000 users
04:30	<zOap_wrk>	spikeb, ok, I'll do that.
04:30	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, cuz i have the feeling that it has to do with something else...
04:30	<viS_>	Is there a package?
04:30	<tristanmike>	gell viS_ about java
04:30	<rackerz>	grimboy, how do i fix it?
04:30	<tristanmike>	!tell viS_ about java
04:30	<Celestar>	ok step 0) get rid of bash
04:30	<jazzido>	claes: already tried that. but for some reason Packages.gz from dapper-updates doesn't gets downloaded
04:30	<Celestar>	the default user may do ANYTHING?
04:30	<grimboy>	rackerz, downgrade?
04:30	<zOap_wrk>	h3sp4wn, I'm using the swedish mirror. works fast
04:30	<Corey>	hey guys all the games I play now are really laggy since i played around wiht the driver settings :(
04:30	<jazzido>	claes: MD5Sum mismatch, actually
04:30	<concept10>	what package(s) do I remove to get rid of my old kernels?
04:31	<viS_>	!javadebs
04:31	<ubotu>	In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-java5-jre is in multiverse
04:31	<Krank1>	Got the live CD to work finally
04:31	<concept10>	is it the linux-images?
04:31	<rackerz>	grimboy, im confused, in dapper RC totem worked fine if i used automatix :S
04:31	<claes>	jazzido, Could be your mirror that aren't updated fully yet.
04:31	<h3sp4wn>	z0ap_wrk: It will be fine
04:31	<zenlinuxNH>	Are Ubuntu release celebrations getting out of hand? http://xumbi.eponym.com/_photos/dapper.jpg
04:31	<MrKeuner>	why does't update manager already warn me that there is a release?
04:31	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, how many hard drives do you have ?
=== RDNIGAA is now known as Exodus
04:31	<jazzido>	claes: i'm using archive.ubuntu.com
04:31	<buzzed>	so can we talk about Dapper here now?
04:31	<lefty_2nd>	ty guys, thought so.  Btw what how so you make a live cd version to use a usb drive - sorry for noob questions, now that got dapper im wanting to do more than just play with it when fed up of M$
04:31	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, I told you, one, with some partitions
04:31	<chavo>	concept10, yes
04:31	<spikeb>	yup buzzed :)
04:31	<kspath>	buzzed: yes
04:31	<tristanmike>	viS_, you can "/msg ubotu <factoid>" for a personal one on one encounter with ubotu, just to let you know :)
04:31	<concept10>	zenlinuxNH, what a geek
04:31	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, why would that matter?
04:31	<Sysop>	hola
04:32	<buzzed>	upgrading now...
04:32	<Hexidigital_>	Happy Dapper Day everyone! i assume channel Ubuntu+1 no longer exists??
04:32	<MarcN>	whois zenlinuxNH
04:32	<Celestar>	ok how would I start the ssh daemon?
04:32	<andrejkw>	The Dapper installer is so unreliable, it's insane.
04:32	<claes>	jazzido, Then perhaps it's to hammered by all the release champange. Or perhaps by all the downloads. :-)
04:32	<buzzed>	ubuntu+1 is still there
04:32	<zenlinuxNH>	That's actually a co-worder of mine, my photo is much tamer.
04:32	<Katu>	cass u there? why you not responding
04:32	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: have you installed openssh?
04:32	<Frogzoo>	buzzed: yep
04:32	<viS_>	tristanmike: i get the following error: E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-bin
04:32	<grimboy>	Celestar, try ssh 127.1 because it runs automatically from install of ubuntu for me.
04:32	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: lets see.
04:32	<shenki>	jdub, noticed your blog post and tried out 'apt-get install vmware-player'
04:32	<snoops>	what kind of installer does 'alternate' have?
04:32	<dunnix>	hello everyone
04:32	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, becauwse I don't know if you have another hard drive on /dev/hdc. Your cdrom has bad sectors on it.
04:32	<buzzed>	i have 1 hour 22 minutes
04:33	<snoops>	because the desktop release uses the live cd to install, doesn't it?
04:33	<tristanmike>	viS_, have you enabled the repos ?
04:33	<Cass>	Katu, i pm'd you, did you not get a screen with me ?
04:33	<tristanmike>	!tell viS_ about repos
04:33	<kspath>	buzzed:
04:33	<kspath>	buzzed:  ?
04:33	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: you installing server or client?>
04:33	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: server
04:33	<shenki>	a question, does the system require a reboot before you can run vmware-player?
04:33	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: problems with finding the CD.
04:33	<Cass>	Katu, i did it again
04:33	<buzzed>	my upgrade via upgrade-manager
04:33	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: ok... in terminal ->	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
04:33	<fatalblu>	is vmware-server in multiverse?
04:33	<Katu>	cass: i only got hi frmo you and then i explained you my situation, look like i have to register my nick first
04:33	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: yeah, but it can't read the CD for some reason ...
04:33	<Cass>	ahh ok, i didnt see your reply
04:34	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, but what should i try now? burn at 4x?
04:34	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: you should disable the cdrom repos
04:34	<claes>	fatalblu, Only vmware-player I think.
04:34	<jazzido>	claes: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-updates/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz  MD5Sum mismatch
04:34	<Katu>	cass: let me register my nick first hold on ok
04:34	<fatalblu>	claes :-(
04:34	<kspath>	Katu: /msg nickserv help
04:34	<Cass>	ok
04:34	<rackerz>	can anybody help me fix my sound?
04:34	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: I'd do that how?
04:34	<fatalblu>	server is the one i want to keep updated, i don't care about player
04:34	<claes>	jazzido, Check another mirror.
04:34	<dunnix>	rackerz: whats wrong with your sound?
04:34	<voraistos>	 is the UK mirror OK ?
04:34	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: system ->	administration ->	synaptic package manager :: click Settings->	repositories
04:34	<rackerz>	totem says it cannot establish connection to the sound server
04:35	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: lemme know when you get there
04:35	<claes>	fatalblu, perhaps the server will come when it's released. Depends on vmware license.
04:35	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: I have no GUI, telnet only :)
04:35	<dunnix>	rackerz: does your other sound work?
04:35	<Greg2>	i'm a bit confused about which 6.06 iso i need to d/l... it's for a permanent dual boot setup
04:35	<Greg2>	do i want the desktop, server, or alternate install iso?
04:35	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: :( sorry, dont know how to do it by command line
04:35	<Ng>	Greg2: desktop
04:35	<Frogzoo>	Greg2: alternate if ur upgrading?
04:35	<buzzed>	so what are you all looking forward to in Dapper?
04:35	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: I'll find out
04:35	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: can you read graphical websites?
04:35	<Ng>	Celestar: edit /etc/apt/sources.list
04:36	<Stork>	dapper isn't cool :(
04:36	<Hexidigital_>	ubotu:: tell Celestar about easysource
04:36	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, check the md5 sum of the .iso file you downloaded (I dunno how to do that in windows)
04:36	<Frogzoo>	buzzed: instant lamp install's nice
04:36	<grimboy>	Celestar, telnet is evil
04:36	<voraistos>	dapper has a nice name ;)
04:36	<Celestar>	grimboy: make a suggestion ..
04:36	<fatalblu>	rsh!
04:36	<grimboy>	Celestar, ssh
04:36	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: ubotu sent you a private message with how to configure the repos
04:36	<snoops>	linuxboy there's a program called md5sum people can grab.. there's another called md5summer
04:36	<MINK9Y>	screw fopp, I'm a dapper dan man!
04:36	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, i already did
04:36	<snoops>	LinuxJones*
04:36	<Celestar>	grimboy: if you followed the discussion, that's what I'm trying to install ...
04:36	<fatalblu>	nien, use nc connected to sh!
04:36	<grimboy>	Celestar, oh, oops
04:37	<rackerz>	dunnix: No i don't think my sound is working :(
04:37	<Hexidigital_>	grimboy:: we're trying to install ssh, can't get the repos correct
04:37	<snoops>	I love how my dual booting with dapper doesn't even work!
04:37	<Celestar>	grimboy: I'm actually on a serial console, 9600bps
04:37	<grimboy>	Celestar, eek
04:37	<voraistos>	Celestar: that is a challenge
04:37	<fatalblu>	real men run apt-get dist-upgrade across a null modem cable!
04:37	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, if they are ok change to another brand of cdrom and burn at like 4x liek you said
04:37	<Celestar>	grimboy: the computer has no VGA or DVI port, or any graphics card for that matter
04:37	<dunnix>	rackers : mine either
04:37	<MrKeuner>	why does't update manager already warn me that there is a release?
04:38	<fatalblu>	who you calling a geek?
04:38	<Hexidigital_>	fatalblu:: well, myself, actually... but i'm not alone
04:38	<Hexidigital_>	MINK9Y:: :-P

04:38	<voraistos>	everybody is ;)
04:38	<ubotu>	from memory, sensors is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SensorInstallHowto
04:38	<iNiku>	how would you guys install dapper on an existing system that has /home (which needs to be preserved) on LVM?
04:38	<LinuxJones>	MrKeuner, because it's looking at different sources if you were on Ubuntu Breezy
04:38	<Celestar>	WEE
04:38	<Celestar>	I have ssh :)
04:39	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: excellent :)
04:39	<grimboy>	Celestar, YAY!
04:39	<Celestar>	great.
04:39	<[zero] >	How come I cant see my other HDD which has win XP on?
04:39	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: now ditch the TELNET
04:39	<MrKeuner>	LinuxJones/ What do you mean by sources? repositories?
04:39	<LinuxJones>	iNiku, jsut do a normal install but custom partitioning
04:39	<snoops>	I so wish the forums were up so I could, post my problem
04:39	<LinuxJones>	MrKeuner, yes
04:39	<tarzeau>	pony!
04:39	<Hexidigital_>	snoops:: what's the problem?
04:39	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: nope, it's the ALOM
04:39	<MrKeuner>	Which reposotry should be there? in order to upgrade?
04:39	<iNiku>	LinuxJones: it will recognize LVM?

04:40	<LinuxJones>	MrKeuner, you can upgrade to dapper using update-notifier but the servers are overloaded. Download using bittorrent, burn the cd and insert it into your drive it will ask if you want to upgrade to dapper.
04:40	<Celestar>	whats next?
04:40	<grimboy>	Celestar, that's a pretty serious piece of kit.
04:40	<voraistos>	dapper, c' est que du bon

04:41	<DShepherd>	Stork: why?
04:41	<neoncode>	Execpt the lack of GUI
04:41	<flithm>	hey everyone... I followed the method on the wiki for upgrading to 6.06 using "update-manager" and it doesn't give me any choice to upgrade the distro... it just says I'm up to date with my packages?
04:41	<Hexidigital_>	voraistos:: sorry
04:41	<viS_>	How do I get the notification area plugin in xchat to work? (Ubuntu 6.06)
04:41	<DShepherd>	neoncode: one has more server like stuff
04:41	<Stork>	well
04:41	<Celestar>	Stork: a Single Ultrasparc T1 (8 Core CPU. 4 threads / core)
04:41	<jsgotangco>	neoncode: server can install LAMP by default
04:41	<snoops>	Hexidigital_: desktop 6.06 install.. it doesn't work with dual booting.. tells me it's installing grub (with an hdd which has a primary windows install first, then 2 ext3 partitions(/ and /boot) and swap) then says it's scanning for hdd's to add to grub.. then tells me to reboot.. then no grub and straight boot to xp.
04:41	<grimboy>	Celestar: sudo ps root or something simelar.
04:41	<h3sp4wn>	iNiku: Yep
04:41	<Stork>	Celestar, score!
04:41	<Stork>	well, i don't like dapper for a number of reasons

04:42	<brainlessbob>	grimboy thanks :D
04:42	<DShepherd>	Stork: that's not dappers fault. that feature was taken out of gaim.
04:42	<Celestar>	samab daemon running \o/
04:42	<snoops>	Hexidigital_ it never asked me to....after I chose the install for boot, / and swap..it begin the install

04:43	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
04:43	<Hexidigital_>	snoops:: it should be after the install... it should ask if you want GRUB installed on the MBR... something else is the problem if that didn't happen
04:43	<Krank1>	Now to get the DVD iso
04:43	<Stork>	DShepherd, yeah, and that was like the best feature of gaim
04:43	<DShepherd>	nathansnook: i hope so

04:43	<SHUTTLEWRTH>	MARK SHUTTLEWORTH AND CANONICAL ANNOUNCE LINUX FOR NIGGERS
04:43	<[zero] >	How come I cant see my other HDD which has win XP on?
04:43	<SHUTTLEWRTH>	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04:43	<SHUTTLEWRTH>	ISLE OF MAN - June 1, 2006 - At a press conference today, Canonical CEO and Free Software spokesnigger Mark Shuttleworth announced the immediate availability of version 6.06 of the Ubuntu Linux distribution. The latest version, known by its code name, "The Diaper Drake," includes special features designed to make Linux easier and more comfortable for niggers the world over.
04:43	<SHUTTLEWRTH>	"Niggers have always had trouble understanding new technology," Shuttleworth began. "Computers are no exception. Some people have said this is because niggers are dumb, but I believe the real problem is that technology has traditionally been designed for white people. Ubuntu changes all that. It was developed from the ground up with niggers in mind. It will usher in a whole new era of Afro-ergonomic computing."
04:43	<DShepherd>	Stork: if you go to #gaim and ask, they'll tell you why
04:43	<SHUTTLEWRTH>	Shuttleworth presented an overview of some of the features users could expect in the latest version of Ubuntu, including an Ebonics-to-English converter, African "tribal beats" sound and desktop theme, and a collection of rap music and gay pornography, "which of course will be encoded using patent and royalty-free formats," Shuttleworth added, smiling. He proceeded to elaborate, but OpenOffice.org Impress crashed at that point.
04:44	<Celestar>	hm ...
04:44	<Hexidigital_>	thank you gnomefreak
04:44	<snoops>	Hexidigital_, after the install is complete it says to reboot, and make sure the cd it taken out :)
04:44	<iNiku>	wtf?
04:44	<LinuxJones>	flithm, the demand is insane :)
04:44	<NthDegree>	[zero] : in ubuntu or on GRUB?
04:44	<KenSentMe>	Hi, this afternoon i've installed rtorrent on my machine to manage torrent downloads using putty. Now when i start rtorrent it doesn't continue downloading. How do i check if my downloaded files are complete or how do i continue the downloads?
04:44	<Celestar>	apt kind of rocks
04:44	<Frogzoo>	iNiku: xactly
04:44	<Celestar>	I never noticed
04:44	<snoops>	have you tried the new 6.06 gui installer Hexidigital_?
04:44	<Celestar>	is there any central administration tool in ubuntu?
04:44	<MrKeuner>	does dapper-dvd include desktop server and alternate(whatever it means)?
04:44	<kspath>	apparently a worthless moron resides @69.46.139.69
04:44	<Toran>	Hey guys, I'm having some SERIOUS problems with my upgrade, can anyone help?
04:44	<Hexidigital_>	snoops:: i dont know... yes, i use 6.06 now, and am very familiar with the installer for my config
04:44	<DShepherd>	Stork: and the workspace does show you the icon. so what else is your problem? what else dont you like
04:44	<neoncode>	Bah. I'll get ubuntu server and I'll SHH to it or something with my Laptop....
04:44	<Toran>	I'm getting the following message on apt-get operations: gconftool-2: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgconf-2.so.4: undefined symbol: g_slice_alloc0
04:45	<LinuxJones>	Celestar, not a centralized one, System >>	Administration
04:45	<Toran>	And it errors out on stuff and I am stuck.
04:45	<Celestar>	LinuxJones: ok lets see if I have an X server installed :)
04:45	<Stork>	DShepherd, it doesn't for me
04:45	<Hexidigital_>	snoops:: i dont know... something is wrong there, if grub didnt ask where to install
04:45	<Toran>	Someone PLEASE help me
04:45	<NthDegree>	kspath, thought you were gonna say useless morons are in the ip range 88.107.*.* :P
04:45	<sweetnjguy29>	Has anyone had a trouble free upgrade?
04:45	<grimboy>	installArchives() failed :(
04:45	<eXistenZ>	!plf
04:45	<DShepherd>	Stork: ok. i think it should
04:45	<ubotu>	I guess plf is the Penguin Liberation Front, see http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf , mainly for i386 users with some packages for ppc
04:45	<buzzed>	is there any concern about this " warnings.warn("apt API not stable yet", FutureWarning)"
04:45	<[zero] >	NthDegree, in ubuntu
04:45	<NthDegree>	Toran, what is the problem
04:45	<grimboy>	sweetnjguy29, not me
04:45	<Celestar>	LinuxJones: no X server. any ncurses / CLI thingy?
04:45	<LinuxJones>	sweetnjguy29, most peopel yeah
04:45	<AngryElf_>	is there a wiki page on the difference between alternative/server/desktop versions??
04:45	<Zoohouse>	flithm, are you using 0.42.2ubuntu12~br ?
04:45	<claes>	sweetnjguy29, So far trouble free.
04:46	<NthDegree>	[zero] : you don't see it because it probably isn't mounted
04:46	<Toran>	Where can I paste? the upgrade broke firefox.
04:46	<snoops>	Hexidigital_, doesn't make sense.. it said it was installing grub, then it told me grub was scanning for bootable hdd's.
04:46	<grimboy>	!paste
04:46	<ubotu>	Please do not flood the channel http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ for pasting long texts it does not disrupt the channel. [webboard for Ubuntu: http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=1269 : not an offical package] 
04:46	<LinuxJones>	Celestar, what are you trying to fix /
04:46	<snoops>	then it said it was complete, and that I should reboot
04:46	<[zero] >	Oh right thankx
04:46	<kspath>	NthDegree: Why would I say that?
04:46	<Frogzoo>	voraistos: in the US there's been some extrem right wing agitation against linux - it's a terrorist threat & supported by democrats blah blah
04:46	<siimz>	is there an i586 iso of ubuntu dapper? or just a 386?
04:46	<dfgas>	man this ca0106 sound card sux arse, i need to turn the volume of my mike up

04:46	<qsrv>	hi
04:46	<Celestar>	LinuxJones: I'm trying to get used to ubuntu. All that on a headless server (ultrasparc-based)
04:46	<Frogzoo>	siimz: get the 386 iso & upgrade to 686 kernel
04:47	<flithm>	Zoohouse, yeah I think it doesn't automatically upgrade like everyone says it says... I am following the manual method, and it works fine
04:47	<threat>	Frogzoo, heh, yeah, using linux means your a commy
04:47	<Toran>	Everything is broken
04:47	<Toran>	I can't visit webpages
04:47	<NthDegree>	Toran:  Just use synaptic to reinstall firefox
04:47	<SurfnKid>	any reason why my XMMS sound is so crappy?
04:47	<shriphani>	guys my update manager doesnt detect drapper
04:47	<keithg>	flithm, What is the manual method?
04:47	<Toran>	Synaptic won't start
04:47	<jazzido>	ok, now this is stupid. updated my sources.list, did apt-get update, and this is what i get from apt-get dist-upgrade:
04:47	<Zoohouse>	flithm, sounds good
04:47	<jazzido>	The following packages will be upgraded:
04:47	<jazzido>	  pcmcia-cs
04:47	<Hexidigital_>	snoops:: i dont know, sorry :( but dont quit on us, there are lots of brilliant people that answer questions very quickly
04:47	<siimz>	NoUse, LinuxJones, Frogzoo, ok thanks ;)
04:47	<The_Machine>	same here shriphani
04:47	<Toran>	synaptic: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_intern_static_string
04:47	<sweetnjguy29>	Frogzoo:  have u been reading shelleytherepublican?
04:47	<qsrv>	a more gnome and evolution related question : is there an easy way to make evolution automatically delete old messages (spread across several folders) ?
04:47	<NthDegree>	Toran, then aptitude
04:47	<grimboy>	SurfnKid, you're not using the eq?
04:47	<The_Machine>	having problems with the repositories
04:47	<The_Machine>	i think
04:47	<voraistos>	Frogzoo: ??????? in the US the have ill people. And they have Bill Gates too. They cant be normal.
04:47	<Celestar>	how do I install some X server?
04:47	<shriphani>	guys how to update using apt-get ?
04:47	<Frogzoo>	sweetnjguy29: that's the one!!! what a winner
04:47	<dfgas>	jazzido, did you upgrade to the rc?
04:47	<snoops>	Hexidigital_..it feels like a forum question to me!..but the forums are down
04:47	<jazzido>	dfgas: rc?
04:47	<snoops>	of course
04:47	<SurfnKid>	grimboy, yeah but the bass sounds distorted and in Windows it sounds just fine
04:48	<sweetnjguy29>	frogzoo:  i think its a flame/troll site
04:48	<jazzido>	dfgas: ah, no
04:48	<NthDegree>	shriphani: apt-get update then apt-get upgrade
04:48	<dfgas>	oh
04:48	<jazzido>	dfgas: i didn't upgrade at all! I can't!
04:48	<flithm>	keithg, check the wiki, it's right below the update-manager way
04:48	<tubbie>	how do I install kernel dev files??
04:48	<shriphani>	ok
04:48	<grimboy>	SurfnKid, your speakers arn't properly plugged in?
04:48	<keithg>	flithm,  Thanks for the information.
04:48	<shriphani>	so that will install drapper ?
04:48	<Celestar>	HELL
04:48	<Zoohouse>	flithm, it might work later in the day maybe. I noticed that the xubuntu link on the ubuntu site is also dead
04:48	<Frogzoo>	sweetnjguy29: I think our recent friend may have been fired up by just that article
04:48	<The_Machine>	apt-get update is giving me an error, NthDegree
04:48	<jazzido>	dfgas: update-manager thinks i'm up to date. but i'm *not*
04:48	<shriphani>	dapper ^
04:48	<Celestar>	installing kdm takes a shitload of packages
04:48	<Zoohouse>	Well i gata run, later flithm
04:48	<Hexidigital_>	NthDegree:: shouldn't that be sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
04:48	<neoncode>	I have a computer that needs to function as a server and a Desktop Computer. Witch version do I get?
04:48	<NthDegree>	shriphani: apt-get dist-upgrade to get dapper
04:48	<shriphani>	ok
04:48	<The_Machine>	anyone know what repositories i should be suing?
04:48	<The_Machine>	using, even
04:48	<The_Machine>	(lol)
04:48	<SurfnKid>	grimboy, theyre built in, sounds like the song is ok but with a gargle distortion on it and makes the bass sound weird, what do u use?
04:48	<shriphani>	so that will upgrade my system without f00king my data up ?
04:48	<iNiku>	The_Machine: I wouldn't sue just yet :)
04:48	<The_Machine>	i think mine are jacked up.
04:49	<Frogzoo>	sweetnjguy29: oh, you mean it's a spoof site!? sad it's so hard to tell these days *sigh*
04:49	<The_Machine>	haha iNiku :)
04:49	<grimboy>	"The upgrade aborts now, your system could be unstable"... crap.
04:49	<sweetnjguy29>	frogzoo:  just the stuff that dude says is so off the wall, its gotta be a troll -- http://shelleytherepublican.com/
04:49	<grimboy>	Argh...
04:49	<NthDegree>	Hexidigital:  I don't use sudo, I use su for security so I never tell anyone else to do anything I don't do myself
04:49	<sweetnjguy29>	I think it makes fun of http://shelleytherepublican.blogspot.com/
04:49	<Celestar>	72 packages to install
04:49	<Celestar>	wow
04:49	<snoops>	what's the alternate install for?
04:49	<Hexidigital_>	NthDegree:: i actually meant the dist-upgrade part
04:49	<Celestar>	apt rocks :)
04:49	<Hexidigital_>	NthDegree:: but you said it later on
04:50	<jazzido>	Celestar: apt sucks.
04:50	<Deep1>	anyone know why I am getting bzip errors with the ca archive?
04:50	<grimboy>	snoops, people with less than 192MB of ram.
04:50	<snoops>	because maybe it's just the desktop install which has this inane problem
04:50	<jazzido>	;)
04:50	<ubuntuNewbee>	hi there to all
04:50	<shriphani>	man even apt-get says i am up to date
04:50	<claes>	snoops, Text based install. The "old" install cd.
04:50	<snoops>	ah right, thanks grimboy
04:50	<shriphani>	what is going on
04:50	<grimboy>	hey ubuntuNewbee
04:50	<snoops>	ohh
04:50	<Celestar>	jazzido: why? :P
04:50	<The_Machine>	little help for a list of where i can find good repositories to upgrade with?
04:50	<The_Machine>	i think my list is jacked up :)
04:50	<NthDegree>	shriphani: apt-get dist-upgrade
04:50	<shriphani>	i did that
04:50	<ubuntuNewbee>	I have a tough question, please
04:50	<claes>	jazzido, use aptitude then. same syntax as apt-get but better.
04:50	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell The_Machine about sources
04:50	<shriphani>	says 0 to upgrade 0 to install and 0 to remove
04:51	<NthDegree>	shriphani: try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade#
04:51	<jazzido>	Celestar: this is so frustrating. really. i think there's a file somewhere that makes upgrade-manager think that i already updated
04:51	<NthDegree>	without the # tho
04:51	<The_Machine>	thanks gnomefreak
04:51	<shriphani>	ok
04:51	<gnomefreak>	yw
04:51	<SurfnKid>	grimboy, i think i got it, XMMS volume was maxxed and MAIN VOL was too low so that did it
04:51	<ubuntuNewbee>	I've just tried to install Dapper on a system with 256MB of RAM
04:51	<Fracture>	where can I find out what's on the DVD iso ?
04:51	<mathieu>	shriphani: you need to alter sources.list first probably
04:51	<Frogzoo>	!tell The_Machine about torrent
04:51	<guillem101>	wow! what a traumatic upgrade! Seems that everything is working right now bug I have had problems with openoffice's lib32 stuff in my AMD64...
04:51	<grimboy>	Wow, gksudo has completely changed
04:51	<jdmpike>	exit
04:51	<SurfnKid>	gotta shower i got an appointment and im running late
04:51	<SurfnKid>	bbl
04:51	<eXistenZ>	why isn't there a shortcut for nautilus in the accessories menu?
04:51	<shriphani>	and what do i put in there ?
04:51	<ubuntuNewbee>	is there a way to install it without going through Live?
04:51	<jazzido>	and now, it seems that the whole dapper deal it's just about a SINGLE package
04:51	<snoops>	well I guess I'll try an install of alternate, because I bet it's the graphical installer stuffing up
04:51	<grimboy>	It now blanks out the screen.
04:51	<mathieu>	shriphani: replace breezy by dapper
04:52	<shriphani>	all repos ?
04:52	<krazykit>	ubuntuNewbee: the alternative install cd will do it
04:52	<claes>	jazzido, What have you been using before?
04:52	<shriphani>	all repositories ?
04:52	<ubuntuNewbee>	that's text based install, right?
04:52	<kane77>	can anyone help repartition my harddrive??
04:52	<krazykit>	shriphani: comment/remove the backports repo, if you have.  there are no edgy backports yet
04:52	<concept10>	which kernel is the smp kernel ?
04:52	<gnomefreak>	shriphani: yes
04:52	<void^>	ubuntuNewbee: the alternate cd perhaps. i just had no problems installing from live on a 256mb ram system, though
04:52	<jazzido>	claes: what what? distro? upgrade method?
04:52	<krazykit>	ubuntuNewbee: yeah, it is
04:52	<gnomefreak>	all of them is fine
04:52	<eXistenZ>	!plf
04:52	<ubotu>	I guess plf is the Penguin Liberation Front, see http://wiki.ubuntu-fr.org/doc/plf , mainly for i386 users with some packages for ppc
04:52	<NthDegree>	shriphani:  Download the alternate install CD and install dapper
04:52	<h3sp4wn>	http://www.mirror.ac.uk/mirror/archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ (is still working very quickly) if you want to dist-upgrade
04:52	<shriphani>	i have a download limit
04:52	<claes>	jazzido, What version of ubuntu?
04:52	<gnomefreak>	NthDegree: hes upgrading
04:52	<Frogzoo>	!tell shriphani about torrent
04:52	<jazzido>	claes: breezy
04:52	<shriphani>	ok i am gonna download that
04:53	<ubuntuNewbee>	well that's a big step aside from FC5 style of installing
04:53	<lefty_2nd>	Anyone have a link to a guide for running a live cd of ubuntu - wanting to show to work that can run and save documents, update OS and programs, off of just 2 or 3 cds (1386, ppcand possbily amd64) and a USB drive.  Not tried to do this b4 (only got usb drive last week :) ), and want to learn the basics b4 Monday if I can.  Forums a little slow atm or id do a full crawl there :)
04:53	<Puffball>	I installed a couple of packages from the debian repository, remove the sources, but later a few packages are then broken. So, when I remove the broken package it prompts me showing that a gazillion packages need to be removed along with it, even though it is a duplicate version of a package I already have, but from the debian server. So, in result, none of the packages will install and the update manager prompts "software index
04:53	<Puffball>	 broken" and closes, so would anybody have an idea on how to fix this?
04:53	<_pm>	im using the ubuntu flight 6, how can i upgrade it to the final version?
04:53	<grimboy>	What do I do if I got half way throught the upgrade then it said I was on my own?
04:53	<claes>	jazzido, No fiddling with dapper at all. Release candidates and so on?
04:53	<ubuntuNewbee>	Ubuntu wants to be a Linux fro humans
04:53	<gnomefreak>	Puffball: dont use debian repos on ubuntu
04:53	<moonlite1>	i need to concatenate two pdf-documents. any ideas?
04:53	<NoUse>	_pm sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
04:53	<gnomefreak>	Puffball: the repos are not binary compatable with ubuntu
04:53	<ubuntuNewbee>	it should be a way to install it directly graphical
04:54	<concept10>	None of the new kernels have the -smp tag.  Anyone know which kernel in the repo supports HT?
04:54	<ubuntuNewbee>	don't you think?
04:54	<jazzido>	claes: no, i tried to upgrade to a RC but got bitten by a bug involving ubuntu-desktop (it's on launchpad, i reported it a gazillion times, other people too, never got a response)
04:54	<Frogzoo>	moonlite1: pdf2ps ?
04:54	<gnomefreak>	ubuntuNewbee: the desktop cd has a gui installer
04:54	<Puffball>	gnomefreak, well yes, I know that now

04:54	<tubbie>	how do I set which gcc version to work?
04:54	<NthDegree>	gnomefreak:  i've seen debian stuff in universe and debian say they are supposed to be
04:54	<ubuntuNewbee>	but it goes through Live
04:54	<void^>	ubuntuNewbee: i just installed, it's a matter of 5 to 10 clicks now, easiest setup ever
04:54	<Celestar>	hm?
04:54	<claes>	jazzido, Did you then downgrade again?
04:54	<jitu>	cass i am katu
04:54	<Celestar>	now windowmaker?
04:54	<Celestar>	no*
04:54	<Jowi>	Puffball, gnomefreak: would a apt-get autoclean solve that maybe?
04:54	<Frogzoo>	tubbie: makefiles usually accept CC as an env
04:54	<gnomefreak>	Puffball: you can try to take them out of list and run sudo apt-get -f install
04:54	<h3sp4wn>	Puffball: If you need something from sid just get the source packages and build against the dapper libs
04:54	<ubuntuNewbee>	void^ Trust me
04:55	<ubuntuNewbee>	I tried
04:55	<jazzido>	claes: never upgraded. update-manager never got the the point of actually downloading the dapper packages
04:55	<gnomefreak>	NthDegree: they are not compatible
04:55	<Puffball>	ah
04:55	<KenSentMe>	ubuntuNewbee: what do you mean by goes through live?
04:55	<ubuntuNewbee>	it is painfully slow

04:55	<moonlite1>	Frogzoo: hm, that will just get me two postscript-files. How do i concatenate them?
04:55	<gnomefreak>	sasa: stop that
04:55	<KenSentMe>	ubuntuNewbee: no, you don't have to use a live cd, just download the iso of the install cd
04:55	<claes>	jazzido, Aha. didn't know it could do that.
04:55	<robinl1>	What to do with VIA DXS switches in alsamixer?
04:55	<Corey>	um
04:55	<kspath>	sasa: Please do not do that.
04:55	<lord_rob>	ubuntuNewbee: maybe remove the cd from your drive ? :)
04:55	<robinl1>	because the sound volume is low.
04:55	<robinl1>	Can anyone help me?
04:55	<lenny__>	hi I just installed ubuntu and now I'm feeling the urge to steal a bike. is this normal?

04:56	<MINK9Y>	I just installed an old xbox 8Gb HDD in my machine, wanting to format it and install ubuntu. running the livecd, but gparted doesn't seem to want to format the drive. any suggestions?
04:56	<snoops>	lenny__ very.
04:56	<robinl1>	lenny_: Nice joke.
04:56	<sweetnjguy29>	robin: have you tried the alsamixer package?
04:56	<gnomefreak>	NthDegree: they are not differnt packages with different names/versions
04:56	<void^>	ubuntuNewbee: check your cd media and drive combo. it did take nearly 1 hour to install because the dvd drive in this laptop reads cdrws at single speed. other that, no issues.
04:56	<robinl1>	..
04:56	<Puffball>	Jowi, not really, it just deleted all the obsolete packages left over from the dapper upgrade
04:56	<void^>	+than

04:59	<Greg2>	Frogzoo: tell bot thanks
04:59	<grimboy>	robinl1,  what?
04:59	<MrObvious>	Hi. I heard about a new version of Ubuntu called Dapper Drake I believe. I was wondering, when will it be out and when will I be able to install it and try it out?
04:59	<spikeb>	windowmaker rules :)
04:59	<robinl1>	the VIA DXS things
04:59	<fatalblu>	it's not going that fast, i'm on 800x600 and doing fine
04:59	<robinl1>	what to do with em?
04:59	<spikeb>	MrObvious, it's out, and now :)
04:59	<keithg>	#Ubuntu is in an uproar today.

04:59	<Celestar>	spikeb: yes, but "apt-get install windowmaker" fails
05:00	<robinl1>	the sound is very low volume.
05:00	<babo>	So is dapper out then or what ?  ... :-)
05:00	<Corey>	How do I enable 3D acceleration and OpenGl on my graphics card ?
05:00	<robinl1>	.sure is, keithg
05:00	<Frogzoo>	Corey: should be by default? - in /etc/X11/xorg.conf you should see Load "GLcore"
05:00	<robinl1>	this is not normal anymore.
05:00	<spikeb>	Celestar, wmaker, not windowmaker
05:00	<nalioth_zZz>	welcome to the next level
05:00	<MrObvious>	spikeb: Sweet.

05:00	<fatalblu>	MrObvious it's already out, there's a torrent available at ubuntu.com/download (dont pull the isos the servers are thrashed)
05:00	<Deep1>	anyone else having problems with bzip2 exiting when trying to do an apt-get update?
05:00	<Corey>	no i dont :O
05:00	<Frogzoo>	Greg2: yw, enjoy
05:00	<MrObvious>	I might try it :)
05:00	<tubbie>	h3sp4wn, can't find anything related to gcc
05:00	<grimboy>	I'm half breezy half dapper
05:00	<Celestar>	spikeb: E: Package wmaker has no installation candidate <= guess I have to compile meself
05:00	<fatalblu>	lol at least my debmirror of dapper is going at 1.5 meg
05:00	<snoops>	Frogzoo got time to see if you can help me with an issue regarding the installer and grub and dual booting?
05:00	<spikeb>	hmm
05:00	<spikeb>	no
05:00	<jazzido>	claes: so, which file would be confusing update-manager, making it think that there are no upgrades?
05:00	<grimboy>	I need help becoming completely dapper.
05:01	<spikeb>	i just installed it a couple days ago myself
05:01	<fatalblu>	Celestar apt-cache search windowmaker
05:01	<jazzido>	claes: i'm *sure* that's the problem. a file that never got deleted after a failed upgrade
05:01	<fatalblu>	it's definetly in there
05:01	<Frogzoo>	snoops: this is my 1st time dapper upgrade - but if I can help, I'll shout out
05:01	<Celestar>	fatalblu: no
05:01	<robinl1>	the VIA DXS things, what to do with em? i pasted my amixer output because my sound volume was really weird, and then they said something about VIA DXS, and gave me a command, and suddenly it worked, but i lost the command.. please, help me!
05:01	<claes>	jazzido, Could you paste your /etc/apt/sources.list
05:01	<Frogzoo>	!tell grimboy about torrent

05:01	<MINK9Y>	sparkly clean
05:01	<h3sp4wn>	tubbie: Why are you not running the version of qemu in the repos ?

05:02	<MrObvious>	I'll even help seed the torrent :)
05:02	<snoops>	Frogzoo, okay.. may I pm you - I've asked this question a few times in this chan before, and I like to give big explanations and as such since it's so busy, you're likely to miss something
05:02	<jazzido>	claes: sure, sec
05:02	<Celestar>	spikeb: seems not so ...
05:02	<grimboy>	NthDegree, argh, but if I wanted to reinstall every 6 months I'd use windows.

05:06	<kimo>	can I do 'rpm2cpio' on dapper ?
05:06	<ubuntuNewbee>	KenSentMe, lord_rob: these are the facts: I downloaded Desktop CD and booted from it. The menu showed and there it was the Start/Install Ubuntu. I clicked on it hopping that the installer would ask me what on earth I want: Start for trying, or Install Complete, all in graphical. But nothing of what I would have liked happened. It just started to load and load... It loaded the tryout version...
05:06	<ubuntuNewbee>	...of Ubuntu (LiveCD). I launched the install from there, but it took like 5 minutes just to show the first Installer Window. That's unacceptable. Fedora Core 5 installed in 20 minutes and Ubuntu could take forever to install that way. I tried to install it on 2 machines with 256MB of RAM. Text based install is not an option if we want to show Ubuntu to the others. SEE? I hope I was clear now
05:06	<fatalblu>	oh god!
05:06	<ketsugi>	So sad.
05:06	<Deep6>	claes: can you send it to me, I'm having difficulties with bzip2 dying with my sources.list

05:07	<Corey>	 frogzoo: none of my games are running properly and I open cedega and do a system test and it says opengl direct rendering failed and 3D acceleration failed
05:07	<fatalblu>	Corey there should be a list of modules in your xorg.conf file, add one for 'glx'
05:07	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: the new default one is aimed at more modern desktop machines really and lets people try it out before they install
05:07	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: I just did
05:07	<KenSentMe>	ubuntuNewbee: no, you don't have to use a live cd, just download the iso of the install cd
05:07	<Fracture>	does the desktop iso not contain LVM or RAID support ?
05:07	<DShepherd>	Deep6: past your error in the pastebin

05:08	<Resat>	Trk VArm
05:08	<claes>	jazzido, Sometimes. Just go on. Say yes and move on.
05:08	<Ng>	KenSentMe: that's not really how dapper CDs are arranged - there is no separate live cd anymore, there's a desktop installer CD, which is a live cd that can also install. there's also an alternative CD that offers more advanced install modes and is text based
05:08	<ubuntuNewbee>	NOt?
05:08	<Deep6>	DShepherd: http://pastebin.ca/60651
05:08	<KenSentMe>	Ng: ah ok
05:08	<jazzido>	claes: ok, thanks for the help, man. much appreciated!
05:08	<register_>	some one know how i can use my back and forth buttons on the mouse in Firefox?

05:08	<jdkycdoc>	hi all, i would be very grateful if someone could help me with this: ia m ready to upgrade from breezy to dapper, just changed 'breezy' to 'dapper' everywhere in my sources list, but I have a last minute doubt: i have the british repositories and i wonder if they certainly have the final version, do you know?
05:08	<kspath>	adam`: It will be normal for you to get banned from irc channels with your trolling issues.
05:08	<KenSentMe>	Ng: sorry, i didn't know that
05:09	<chapium>	register_: that is one battle I have yet to win
05:09	<adam`>	what?
05:09	<shriphani>	do i log in as root to update from terminal ?
05:09	<gnomefreak>	jdkycdoc: yes they do
05:09	<krazykit>	jdkycdoc: by now they should.
05:09	<h3sp4wn>	jdkycdoc: They do
05:09	<Fracture>	Ng: does the desktop ISO have LVM support ?
05:09	<akaihola>	Any update on the status of the dapper desktop .jigdo file?
05:09	<krazykit>	shriphani: no, use sudo
05:09	<KenSentMe>	ubuntuNewbee: sorry, i misunderstood
05:09	<Celestar>	ok
05:09	<Fracture>	Ng: or just the alternative one ?
05:09	<michaels>	what do I do to make xorg.conf take effect?
05:09	<Celestar>	nice stuff
05:09	<ubuntuNewbee>	Ng: Have you read what I've said about FC 5
05:09	<ubuntuNewbee>	?
05:09	<shriphani>	ok thanks
05:09	<jdkycdoc>	gnomefreak, krazykit h3sp4wn: thanks a lot you all
05:09	<Celestar>	now I needa set up XDMCP
05:09	<register_>	chapium, ok :) dont know of any howtos or any thing?
05:09	<Ng>	Fracture: I believe it does, yes
05:09	<grimboy>	How do I reinstall all the packages I have?
05:09	<krazykit>	michaels: save the file and restart the xserver
05:09	<Kronoz>	michaels, restart the xserver. ctrl+alt+backspace
05:09	<jacquesmerde>	who's the varment who got me to rm -rf my home directory?
05:09	<Resat>	helpme pls my linux console not internet conn.
05:09	<ubuntuNewbee>	It installs right away
05:09	<Fracture>	Ng: is there a page anywhere that explains what's in the different images ?
05:09	<KenSentMe>	Ng: it's indeed strange that it takes much longer to install than it used to be
05:09	<michaels>	thanks Kronoz krazykit
05:09	<jdkycdoc>	has any of you done the same upgrade?
05:09	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: yes, did you read what I replied with? Grab the alternate install image and you will be able to do an install in under half an hour on a reasonably capable machine
05:10	<Resat>	helpme pls my linux console not internet conn.
05:10	<Resat>	helpme pls my linux console not internet conn.

05:10	<gnomefreak>	Resat: stop spamming
05:10	<fatalblu>	Resat: chill and use all the letters in the words
05:10	<Resat>	ok
05:10	<Ng>	KenSentMe: it doesn't really take much longer, but one issue is the fonts packages I believe - they regenerate things after each of them is installed
05:10	<adam`>	kspath stop trolling

05:10	<Celestar>	spikeb: but you can'T show off having 32 CPUs, can you :P
05:10	<Kronoz>	Resat, explain ...
05:10	<grimboy>	!doesn't work
05:10	<ubotu>	Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day?  Does it want more money?  Is it on IRC all the time?  Please be specific!  Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
05:10	<MrObvious>	32 CPUs?
05:10	<adam`>	you're scaring away the new comers
05:10	<spikeb>	Celestar, nope
05:10	<spikeb>	heh
05:10	<Deep6>	DShepherd: what do you make of that?
05:10	<krazykit>	Resat: plus, if you want help, you need to ask a question that we can actually undertand.
05:10	<Resat>	privite pls help

05:11	<KenSentMe>	Ng: i haven't tried the new installer yet. Downloaded dapper in beta
05:11	<ubuntuNewbee>	Ng: thanks for your reply, but as I said, I can't do that with people who want an easy install
05:11	<Boglizk>	I cant download the new update-manager
05:11	<anthony>	!wireless
05:11	<ubotu>	wireless is probably https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCards if it does not work out of the box https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper windows drivers
05:11	<Frogzoo>	!tell snoops about recovergrub
05:11	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: the text installer is easy
05:11	<DShepherd>	Deep6: i am not sure why that is happening. Do you mind pasting your sourcelist too?
05:11	<christo_>	if I install the kernel-source package, where will the sources be installed?

05:11	<Kronoz>	!tell the_mr_bong_show about cups
05:11	<grimboy>	Corey, I know the feeling.
05:12	<gnomefreak>	Boglizk: maybe because you rither need to run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade or you already have it installed
05:12	<krazykit>	sweetnjguy29: don't use firefox as a download manager.  open a terminal and use wget
05:12	<Kronoz>	!cups
05:12	<ubotu>	from memory, cups is The Common UNIX Printing System (or CUPS) is a printing system and general replacement for lpd and the like.  See also http://linuxprinting.org/
05:12	<gnomefreak>	Corey: drop the caps please
05:12	<Borney>	hi :)
05:12	<Corey>	gnomefreak: help me then !

05:12	<ubuntuNewbee>	FC5 install Graphical ->	20 minutes, Ubuntu graphical install forever on the same machine
05:12	<ramza3__>	so I have ubuntu beta.  Does that mean my system is up to date?
05:12	<Kronoz>	Corey, whats you problem?
05:12	<gnomefreak>	Boglizk: what does uname -r say?
05:12	<DShepherd>	ramza3__: no
05:12	<KenSentMe>	ubuntuNewbee: it's a text install, but that doesn't mean it's hard. You don't have to do things manually, it just doesn;t look that fancy etc.
05:12	<WarOfAttrition>	6.10 will be called etch??
05:12	<Deep6>	DShepherd: dapper beta...
05:12	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: I'm just telling you how it is, if you don't like it there's really not much I can do about it. Either give them the desktop installer and they can try ubuntu out and use the graphical installer, or give them the alternate one if they have a low RAM/CPU machine
05:12	<gnomefreak>	WarOfAttrition: no edgy eft
05:12	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: what's so difficult to install about that to understand?
05:12	<ramza3__>	DShepherd, with all of the updates
05:12	<Corey>	Kronoz: I dont know last week i was playing my games perfectly fine and then i use it now and they are getting 1fps

05:13	<Kronoz>	WarOfAttrition, no, edgy eft
05:13	<jra>	sweetnjguy29: you are not really dl'ing an iso with firefox, right?
05:13	<krazykit>	Corey: check to see if direct rendering is working.
05:13	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: I installed a p4 with 512mb of ram in way under an hour with the graphical ubuntu installer this morning
05:13	<Kronoz>	Corey, reinstall nvidia/ati drivers
05:13	<DShepherd>	ramza3__: cat /etc/issue. it should tell you your current version
05:13	<Corey>	Kronoz: how do i do that
05:13	<Corey>	krazykit: how do i do that
05:13	<WarOfAttrition>	edgy eh? that sounds like unstable
05:13	<kspath>	!gnomefreak++
05:13	<Borney>	sorry, but how does XGL work at the moment ?
05:13	<Frogzoo>	Corey: which game? do you have trilinear enabled?
05:13	<SS2>	WarOfAttrition: it is unstable
05:13	<Kronoz>	Corey, terminal ->	glxgears -printfps what does that say?
05:13	<ubuntuNewbee>	Ng: OR give them Desktop CD and the option to install it without a try
05:13	<SS2>	the next release
05:13	<ubuntuNewbee>	is that so hard to do?
05:13	<siimz>	hi im trying to install ubuntu on my pc and television using my radeon 8500 svideo output, and the refresh rate of the default install is over 60hz which wont display on my television, does anyone know a way around this?
05:13	<DShepherd>	Deep6: sorry.. i dont know how to fix your problem

05:14	<DShepherd>	ramza3__: your update todate then
05:14	<Ng>	ubuntuNewbee: I'm not familiar with the internals of how the disc works, so i can't answer that, but even if I could it's irrelevant because it was released today and won't be updated until the next release. If you would like to participate in that, please go to launchpad.net and write a spec/wishlist about it

05:15	<Corey>	Frogzoo: how do i change ?
05:15	<jdkycdoc>	gnomefreak, krazykit h3sp4wn: sorry to bother but does 683 packages and just 239MB for download (including kde stuff) seem right?
05:15	<Celestar>	DShepherd:
05:15	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: nope sounds good
05:16	<gnomefreak>	jdkycdoc: yes
05:16	<krazykit>	jdkycdoc: yeah, sounds about right

05:16	<scorpion007>	Frogzoo: what do you mean reinstall? I tried reinstalling the whole ubuntu distro with boot loader twice and same result. It just tries to load (and fails) ubuntu after a few seconds... :( I also tried using the install CD in recovery mode but wasn't sure what to do...
05:16	<roggan>	i cannot update my 5.10 ubuntu with my update manager (my system seems to be up-to-date),  is ti beacause there's to many connections mayby ?
05:16	<MrKeuner>	does dapper-dvd include dapper-alternate?
05:16	<krazykit>	Pelo: xubuntu :-D
05:16	<Celestar>	DShepherd: that's a crapload of packages :)
05:16	<Frogzoo>	Corey: in /etc/X11/xorg.conf in Modules you need Load "dri"
05:16	<michaels>	logging out and then in also restarts the xserver, right?
05:16	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: i asked the question before here. i got the /etc/skel tip, but noone told me about the chown. took me a while to figure out what was wrong
05:16	<eXistenZ>	I Installed totem-xine and w32codecs, but totem still doesn't play mp3 files, what do I have to do as well?
05:16	<Frogzoo>	scorpion007: I mean reinstall lilo or grub
05:16	<Corey>	Frogzoo: it already has it !
05:16	<tanek>	roggan: did u do sudo update-manager -d?
05:16	<krazykit>	Pelo: should run better on the smaller amount of RAM, since the desktop is lighter than gnome and kde
05:17	<DShepherd>	Celestar: i wouldnt use those words to describe it.. but yeah.. something like that
05:17	<jdkycdoc>	gnomefreak, krazykit: thanks --here we go
05:17	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: i was freaking out for half an hour, unable to log in anywhere but at a vc
05:17	<MrObvious>	Yay 50 hours to download the ISO for 6.06

05:17	<the_mr_bong_show>	i cant find my printer on http://linuxprinting.org/ is there a way i can get it to work even tho
05:17	<DShepherd>	Celestar: that's the way to get kde on ubuntu though
05:17	<Corey>	Frogzoo: This is part of the error. Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
05:17	<lefty_2nd>	COud someone who has used live cds on more than one platform (pc, mac) tell me what partitions I might need to use same usb drive on both, and swap files
05:17	<roggan>	yes

05:17	<ubuntuNewbee>	hical, Ubuntu will be hampered.
05:17	<Corey>	Frogzoo: what do i do with that ?
05:17	<void^>	ubuntuNewbee: i just booted the desktop install cd on another pc with a less crappy dvd drive; no performance issues there. i think it's fine on anything 500mhz or more and 256mb ram or more.
05:17	<sweetnjguy29>	Bog:  Now at 150kbs
05:17	<Celestar>	DShepherd: lets see what happens :)
05:17	<Beforewisdom>	Hi.  I am trying to upgrade to dapper from breezy.  I replaced "breezy" with "dapper" in my sources.list, ran the update manager, and got all sorts of 404s.  Is there anywhere I can get a clean sources.list for upgrading to dapper?
05:17	<Hobbsee>	wow!  we've got more people than #gentoo do!
05:17	<DShepherd>	Celestar: ok
05:17	<roggan>	tanek : yes
05:17	<scorpion007>	Frogzoo: as part of the system reinstall, the boot loader (LILO) was also reinstalled. It did not improve my situation. Breezy install went a lot smoother with GRUB...I don't have a choice of boot loader here.. :(
05:17	<dunnix>	i did an ugrade    do you think a clean install is that much better?
05:17	<Celestar>	I wish I had a faster system HDD :)
05:18	<MrObvious>	76 hours for the ISO now :|
05:18	<jazzido>	!tell Beforewisdom about sources
05:18	<Celestar>	MrObvious: using torrent?
05:18	<fatalblu>	Hobbsee: that's cause gentoo users need support!
05:18	<Corey>	Frogzoo: Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
05:18	<Corey>	direct rendering: No
05:18	<Corey>	OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
05:18	<fatalblu>	;-)
05:18	<MrObvious>	Celestar: Yes.
05:18	<Hobbsee>	fatalblu: hehe
05:18	<carthik>	Pelo, http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/install/i386/ch02.html
05:18	<Pelo>	krazykit  thanks but back to my original question,  is there a system requirement page for ubuntu 6.06 &
05:18	<Pelo>	?
05:18	<DShepherd>	fatalblu: hehehe
05:18	<MrObvious>	Oh I know. I need to forward some ports
05:18	<FunnyLookinHat>	MrObvious, use torrents
05:18	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: a what tag? i just did "sudo chown username /home/username"
05:18	<FunnyLookinHat>	ooh
05:18	<Celestar>	MrObvious: ok let me restart seeding ...
05:18	<FunnyLookinHat>	that's weird
05:18	<Pelo>	thanks carthik
05:18	<tanek>	roggan: then change all instances of "breezy" to "dapper" in /etc/apt/sources.list and do sudo apt-get update&&sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
05:18	<MrObvious>	Celestar: I think I need to forward a few ports.
05:18	<FunnyLookinHat>	I've got mine set to seed for the next week
05:18	<kilotango>	are there hashes available for cd/dvd isos to check downloads with?
05:18	<Frogzoo>	scorpion007: will grub do just as well?
05:18	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: sudo chown username:username /home/username -R
05:18	<the_mr_bong_show>	i cant find my printer on http://linuxprinting.org/ is there a way i can get it to work even th
05:18	<bbrazil>	kilotango: yes, they're in the same directory
05:19	<Pelo>	thanks guys,  have a good one
05:19	<ubuntuNewbee>	void^: maybe I have to crappy CD-ROMs
05:19	<kilotango>	even for torrents?
05:19	<sweetnjguy29>	question:  is lilo the default boot manager now on the live install cd?  I am doing a dual boot and need grub
05:19	<carthik>	kilotango, look at the message for the channel, that page has the isos and urls
05:19	<Mahmoud85>	Hello, can someone help fix this error: http://pastebin.com/751480
05:19	<scorpion007>	Frogzoo, I don't have an option to install GRUB at all...only LILO is there. Maybe because I am installing to LVM?
05:19	<Frogzoo>	sweetnjguy29: nope -grub
05:19	<bbrazil>	kilotango: torrents are just another way of getting ISOs
05:19	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: makes sure the group is set correctly as well and more importantly it recurses through the directories and gets ALL the files not just /home/username
05:19	<ubuntuNewbee>	void^: 2 crappy CD-ROMs
05:19	<cavediver>	What do I need to do in order for my firewall-script to run at boot ? I have created the script in /etc/init.d with start and stop stuff
05:19	<kilotango>	carthik, bbrazil, cheers
05:19	<Grout58>	what command in apt-get will upgrad me to dapper?
05:19	<Frogzoo>	scorpion007: yup, that would do it
05:19	<MrKeuner>	does dapper-dvd include dapper-alternate?
05:19	<Corey>	Frogzoo:???
05:19	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: isnt the group part reundant? and i've forgotten the -R, but still created subsubsubdirectories, etc...
05:20	<sweetnjguy29>	frog: thanks, scorpion had me going there for a second
05:20	<Hobbsee>	Mahmoud85: not enough info - add the stuff before it to your pastebin
05:20	<Beforewisdom>	I tried apt-get update and got about as many unfound urls
05:20	<carthik>	MrKeuner, what is alternate?
05:20	<jonah>	i've tried mplayer, totem, xine, gxine, and also i wanted to make dvds with qdvdauthor. but most players and dvd maker don't seem to play or edit much. i've got the open source avi of elephants dream which i want to burn to dvd and it doesn't even recognise it
05:20	<MrObvious>	Celestar: There it's better.
05:20	<Frogzoo>	Grout58: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
05:20	<ramza3__>	Grout58, apt-get uprade distro or someting
05:20	<Beforewisdom>	is there a place to get a clean sources.list?
05:20	<scorpion007>	Frogzoo: so is there any way for me to enable a menu or prompt? I tried to edit the lilo.conf file but it didn't do anything
05:20	<mwe>	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
05:20	<MrKeuner>	carthik/ what you need in order to upgrade from breezy to dapper
05:20	<MrObvious>	About 60 KB/s now :). Using the torrent as suggested, and I'm uploading about 50KB/s
05:20	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: probably, if you aren't using group permissions anywhere then it shouldn't matter
05:20	<Celestar>	MrObvious: :)
05:20	<void^>	ubuntuNewbee: i don't know what your particular problem is (if there is one). i just made the experience that sometimes certain cd readers don't like certain brands of cdrs or cdrws. this drive in particular doesn't like any cdrws (constant spinups/downs).
05:20	<krazykit>	scorpion007: if you edit lilo.conf, you need to rerun lilo
05:20	<bbrazil>	scorpion007: aftering altering lilo.conf, you need to run 'lilo'
05:20	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: but i'll do your chown instead. do i have to unchown my original chown first?
05:20	<carthik>	MrKeuner, oh. In that case, no, the dvds cant have the entire repo on them.
05:21	<scorpion007>	krazykit: I did that but it just spits out errors about /proc/devices not being present... :(
05:21	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: nah you can just run mine as it
05:21	<Frogzoo>	scorpion007: lilo can be a pain - I'd try tldp.org for a lilo faq
05:21	<krazykit>	scorpion007: as root/sudo?
05:21	<lefty_2nd>	lol way things are going, even with lag on forums, might find answer quicker.  4 those who missed it, any one with exp of using a live cd and usb drive to store settings, what partitions might I need to use same drive on mac and pc to show Ubuntu to work.
05:21	<The_Machine>	question:  after doing an apt-get dist-upgrade, will it give all the new gnome desktop wallpapers and everything, as if i did a CD installation?
05:21	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: done! thanks alot!
05:21	<fatalblu>	ubuntuNewbee: you should get the 100000 5.25 floppy edition ;-)
05:21	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerder: np :-p
05:21	<ubuntuNewbee>	void^: thanks
05:21	<scorpion007>	krazykit: I booted using the install CD and entered recovery mode which mounted my root partition
05:21	<Beforewisdom>	Isn't it wrong to run apt-get dist upgrade if apt-get update isn't successful?
05:22	<carthik>	Beforewisdom, yeah, sort of.
05:22	<krazykit>	Beforewisdom: yes, it's wrong.
05:22	<bbrazil>	Beforewisdom: debatable
05:22	<The_Machine>	lol
05:22	<ubuntuNewbee>	fatalblu: I wish it would be funny
05:22	<Hobbsee>	Beforewisdom: yes...if hte update didnt finish, there's no point trying to upgrade
05:22	<fatalblu>	Beforewisdom: it probably just won't do anything except complain a whole heck of alot
05:22	<ramza3__>	Frogzoo: hmm, I did the dist-upgrade and it downloaded something then quit.  Still looks like breezy
05:22	<Frogzoo>	Beforewisdom: doesn't sound really a good idea, no
05:22	<Mahmoud85>	Hobbsee: Done http://pastebin.com/751490
05:22	<Beforewisdom>	Okay, how can I get a clean sources.list to upgrade from breezy to dapper?
05:22	<krazykit>	scorpion007: well, i'm not familiar with lilo... i perfer grub, myself.  sorry :-/
05:22	<Frogzoo>	ramza3__: you need to swap breezy/dapper in /etc/apt/sources.list
05:22	<yatsura>	lo all, anybody available to answer a WiFi setup question on 5.10?
05:22	<fatalblu>	for a fashionable user experience, try slackware!
05:22	<Hobbsee>	!tell Beforewisdom about repos
05:22	<Zoroaster>	I am about tobuild a little lowend server for a small remote location, all I need is samba to run on it, does intel or amd work better with Ubuntu
05:22	<DShepherd>	ramza3__: try gksudo update-manager -d
05:23	<dewitt>	newbee with/? do you have to remove ubuntu to install kubuntu
05:23	<Beforewisdom>	Hobbsee the robot isn't telling me anything
05:23	<Beforewisdom>	oh wait
05:23	<scorpion007>	krazykit: I loved GRUB when I had breezy, but it seems since I installed dapper on lvm I didn't get the choice of using it..
05:23	<Frogzoo>	Zoroaster: for samba - will make little difference
05:23	<eXistenZ>	I Installed totem-xine and w32codecs, but totem still doesn't play mp3 files, what do I have to do as well?
05:23	<JacksonBrown>	I just couldn't wait last night and installed the release canidate of 6.06, will running the Ubuntu update get me to the same point as the final?

05:24	<FunnyLookinHat>	ubotu, tell BitNinja707 about RestrictedFormats

05:24	<ubotu>	from memory, ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ... the radeon 9200 and below are supported by the open-source drivers
05:24	<scorpion007>	I wouldn't have a problem with lilo, but I really need to put the acpi=off option, otherwise my pc just restarts when trying to boot

05:24	<xet7>	Hi, why in Ubuntu Dapper final autologin stops working after nvidia-glx-legacy and other updates? How to get autologin working again?
05:24	<Hobbsee>	Mahmoud85: you should not use unoffcial repos.  you'll have to remove gstreamer0.8-misc, then sudo apt-get upgrade
05:24	<Hobbsee>	gnomefreak: yeah, wow :P
05:24	<Frogzoo>	JacksonBrown: enjoy :D
05:24	<Seantater_>	for upgrading from flight6 to release -- is dist-upgrade or upgrade better?

05:25	<gnomefreak>	brb
05:25	<Celestar>	fatalblu: not -r?
05:25	<mwe>	Celestar: because it needs to know which resolutions to configure
05:25	<WarOfAttrition>	you can see a screen and there is no graphics card???
05:25	<bbrazil>	Seantater_: for any major upgrade, use dist
05:25	<Celestar>	mwe: seems so
05:25	<eXistenZ>	krazykit, I couldn't find that package in plf
05:25	<Seantater_>	bbrazil: okay -- I'll keep that in mind
05:26	<Hobbsee>	eXistenZ: you should not use plf.

05:27	<Hobbsee>	tristanmike: both do, really :P

05:28	<xet7>	DShepherd: autologin is selected, but still it doesn't login automatically.
05:28	<fatalblu>	jdkycdoc: apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade are different, dist-upgrade will install new packages if needed. you want the dist-upgrade

05:35	<jacquesmerde>	fricking hell. i was wondering why ubuntu was running so slow....i'd gotten rid of my swap partition! it still wasnt that slow though!!
05:35	<Nailor>	krazykit: And I "need" LVM, I like te flexibility of it
05:35	<Corey>	Frogzoo: what do i dooo
05:35	<krazykit>	Nailor: oh, i'd just go with lilo for now, and see if grub can do it later.
05:35	<Corey>	all
05:35	<revmouse>	Geheimnis, the built in bcm43xx doesn't work with all cards. Check out the Wireless section for my laptop, it worked for me. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/HPPavilionZV6233NR

05:35	<tristanmike>	nosklo, I don't understand the question
05:35	<blehe>	how much space should i give the main ubuntu partition?
05:35	<Corey>	all how do I solve this problem Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
05:35	<tristanmike>	!tell federico_ about upgrade
05:35	<Nailor>	krazykit: Well I'm just fine with lilo, but I just wondered has the default boot loader changed :)
05:36	<jra>	oh, ubuntu has a hppa port... wow
05:36	<Frogzoo>	Corey: looks like you're running the vga driver
05:36	<Or>	What is on the dapper DVD? Is it desktop, alternate and server in one?
05:36	<Frogzoo>	Corey: what's your vid card?
05:36	<krazykit>	Nailor: the vast majority of users don't even know what lvm is/does, so i just figured... y'know :-P
05:36	<bbrazil>	Or: as far as I know
05:36	<Corey>	Ati 340M
05:36	<Frogzoo>	!tell Or about torrent
05:36	<Corey>	Frogzoo: its intergrated graphics.
05:36	<Diiba>	So the ubuntu isn't out yet?
05:36	<krazykit>	Diiba: it is.
05:36	<nosklo>	tristanmike, i already have a machine without broadband running breezy, which cd should I use to upgrade it to dapper
05:36	<Frogzoo>	Corey: do you know ati/nvidia/ibm?
05:36	<bbrazil>	Diiba: it's been out a good while now
05:36	<DShepherd>	Diiba: topic
05:36	<Diiba>	:)
05:36	<Corey>	Frogzoo: yes
05:36	<Diiba>	Well, whats the upgrade command?
05:36	<sweetnjguy29>	Diiba:  It came out today -- grab it at http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969
05:36	<bundzoot>	how do you install anything on ubuntu?i am trying to install nero and java
05:36	<h3sp4wn>	Nailor: You could have /boot not using lvm and have grub installed there
05:36	<Or>	Thank you
05:36	<DShepherd>	Diiba: from breezy?
05:37	<defrysk>	!upgrade
05:37	<ubotu>	upgrade is probably Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
05:37	<Frogzoo>	Corey: well install the appropriate driver then
05:37	<Corey>	Frogzoo: Its an AGP card..its shared memory notebook graphics ..?
05:37	<federico_>	thanks
05:37	<Nailor>	krazykit: Yeah, that's my normal answer to lvm-related stuff too :)
05:37	<tristanmike>	nosklo, you don't use the cd to "upgrade", you use the cd to reinstall
05:37	<Frogzoo>	Corey: what does 'sudo lspci' say it is?
05:37	<krazykit>	Corey: give me a second and i think i can resolve your problem
05:37	<jacquesmerde>	my swap partition is currently a fat32 partition, how do i temporarily unmount the swap partition so i can change it to an ACTUAL swap partition?
05:37	<Nailor>	h3sp4wn: I'm just fine with lilo :)
05:37	<tristanmike>	nosklo, and it's the "Desktop CD" for most people

05:37	<nosklo>	oh, i cant upgrade using the CD?
05:37	<Geheimnis>	revmouse: thanks, all I have to do is to install their driver ?
05:37	<Corey>	krazykit: thanks man
05:37	<krazykit>	Corey: but it'll require playing with your xorg.conf :-P
05:38	<sweetnjguy29>	nosklo:  you can, if you have all your files in a seperately partitioned home directory
05:38	<nosklo>	that means I have to reinstall? is it impossible to upgrade using the CD?
05:38	<void^>	jacquesmerde: swapoff

05:38	<Corey>	krazykit: no problems

05:39	<DShepherd>	nosklo: it should
05:39	<revmouse>	Geheimnis, thanks! :D
05:39	<Deep6>	DShepherd: I figured out my problem, it was my proxy server with a content filter (dansguardian) not allowing the bz2 files to be downloaded
05:39	<eyequeue>	nosklo, there is no reason to need a cd to upgrade, it's just a couple of commands
05:39	<NoUse>	andy101 have you clicked the 'check' button and see if it shows up without the -d
05:39	<DShepherd>	Deep6: kool, happier now?

05:55	<Celestar>	hm
05:55	<Frogzoo_away>	runes: nope - /tmp
05:55	<Noah0504>	Okay, Dapper has been released, but why aren't there any upgrades for us that are using the betas or RC?
05:55	<void^>	jacquesmerde: yes
05:55	<Celestar>	Frogzoo_away: I mean I ONLY see a grey screen
05:55	<Celestar>	:P

05:55	<jacquesmerde>	void^: sweet
05:55	<krazykit>	Noah0504: if you updated about 24 hours ago, there shouldn't be any updates, as it was frozen about that time
05:56	<runes>	ok where would I look in the ubuntu manuals to find the default folders created and what they are for?
05:56	<jacquesmerde>	waxon, waxoff. swapon, swapoff
05:56	<jra>	runes: man hier
05:56	<fatalblu>	runes: default folders? where?
05:56	<Noah0504>	krazykit: haha, I got excited about nothing!
05:56	<bbrazil>	runes: try the File Hierarchy Standard
05:56	<runes>	ty!
05:56	<Frogzoo_away>	runes: you want to google 'linux standard base'
05:57	<azurehuesofblue>	what is the bash command to show hidden files?
05:57	<runes>	ok

05:57	<fatalblu>	azurehuesofblue: ls -la hidden files begin with a .

05:57	<Hobbsee>	hehe
05:57	<trainer>	hi, I just upgraded to Dapper but all my repositories in synaptic still say 5.10 - shouldn't they be 6.06?
05:57	<dapper>	h3sp4wn, I did the previous command and I think it worked.
05:58	<tRSS>	hi all. congrats on the release of drapper drake!
05:58	<tuxtheslacker>	hey, can someone send me the ATi driver link?
05:58	<dr_willis>	!ati
05:58	<mwe>	!ati
05:58	<ubotu>	I heard ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ... the radeon 9200 and below are supported by the open-source drivers
05:58	<dapper>	trainer, Do what h3sp4wn just told me to do.
05:58	<tRSS>	i would like to know how I can apt-get to drapper drake without reinstalling?
05:58	<kane77>	how can I merge two partitions together?? when I tried PartitionMagic (in win) i got some error message about something not being on the right place and two options fix or fix later I chose fix later as I wasnt sure what it is... but now it doesnt show my disk at all... (it shows just my first disk...) so how can i merge them (both are ext3)
05:58	<tuxtheslacker>	thanks!
05:58	<dapper>	trainer, in a terminal do: sudo sed -e 's/breezy/dapper' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
05:58	<Corey>	im back
05:58	<Corey>	and it had a blue screen of death
05:58	<tRSS>	hey Corey!
05:59	<Corey>	tRSS: hi..
05:59	<Xylene>	is there anyway to make Xorg on the desktop live cd run in 16bit mode? 24bit is SUPER SLOW on this neomagic chip
05:59	<tRSS>	so how can I update to dapper drake without reinstalling?
05:59	<dr_willis>	!upgrade
05:59	<JoeyB3>	Hwy Corey!!
05:59	<ubotu>	methinks upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
05:59	<dapper>	Do I have to use synaptic or can I use the update-manager?
05:59	<MetaMorfoziS>	anybody know anything about google earth for linux?
05:59	<Hobbsee>	!tell tRSS about update
05:59	<Celestar>	ubotu: NIS
05:59	<ubotu>	I give up. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, Celestar
05:59	<bbrazil>	tRSS: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
05:59	<MetaMorfoziS>	!googleearth
05:59	<ubotu>	I don't know, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, MetaMorfoziS
05:59	<dr_willis>	MetaMorfoziS:  i hear the cedega people are working on it.
05:59	<fatalblu>	tRSS: sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list and change all the references of breezy to dapper
05:59	<Elops>	If I download the source CDs of ubuntu is it faster to add stuff using apt-cdrom ?
05:59	<dapper>	Because update-manager seems to tell me I should use synaptic or apt-get dist-upgrade.  But the webpage says I can use update-manager.
06:00	<tuxtheslacker>	who shit!
06:00	<tuxtheslacker>	somehow this is saying I'm using 95% of my diskspace...
06:00	<ohzie>	How many people updated last night and broke their systems other than me?
06:00	<bbrazil>	Elops: the source CDs contain source code, so I don't think you want those
06:00	<ohzie>	I'm trying to see if updating broke it, or if something else broke it.
06:00	<tRSS>	thanks alot ! :)
06:00	<tuxtheslacker>	/dev/hda7             2.1G  1.9G  102M  95% /

06:00	<Celestar>	how do I enable a NIS client ?

06:00	<tuxtheslacker>	hahahaha!
06:00	<tuxtheslacker>	not a nice realization.
06:00	<andrejkw>	Hey Guys
06:00	<tuxtheslacker>	shit!
06:00	<MetaMorfoziS>	dr_willis: and when it comes out?
06:00	<bbrazil>	Elops: as for whether cds are better, that's a matter of your net connection
06:00	<ohzie>	!news
06:01	<tuxtheslacker>	maybe partition magic will fix it?
06:01	<tuxtheslacker>	:-/.
06:01	<andrejkw>	I installed XGL and Compiz, and now nobody can connect to my Remote Desktop. How can I fix this?
06:01	<northcol>	I would like to try the latest version of amaroK on Ubuntu. I saw there is a .deb package for Kubuntu. Is it safe to try to install it on normal Ubuntu (Dapper Drake)?
06:01	<fatalblu>	tuxtheslacker: i saw that earlier when i was partway through a debmirror of dapper
06:01	<Elops>	isnt there a ubuntu+1 channel?
06:01	<trainer>	dapper, sed: -e expression #1, char 15: unterminated `s' command
06:01	<bbrazil>	northcol: yes
06:01	<bbrazil>	Elops: not at the moment
06:01	<fatalblu>	tuxtheslacker: logcheck started SCREAMING at me
06:01	<kane77>	how can I merge two partitions together?? when I tried PartitionMagic (in win) i got some error message about something not being on the right place and two options fix or fix later I chose fix later as I wasnt sure what it is... but now it doesnt show my disk at all... (it shows just my first disk...) so how can i merge them (both are ext3)
06:01	<Corey>	krazykit: ???
06:01	<ohzie>	When my xserver is disabled, how do I re enable it?
06:01	<revmouse>	Elops, I think its shut down until edgy eft repositories open up
06:01	<northcol>	bbrazil: Thanks for the fast reply!
06:01	<Elops>	oh ok
06:01	<Corey>	Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
06:02	<bbrazil>	kane77: copy data from B to A, delete B, expand A to take up B's space. This is a non-trivial task, backup your data first
06:02	<revmouse>	Elops, which will be sometime mid-june
06:02	<saif>	any ideas how i change the port for gnomebittorrent?
06:02	<fatalblu>	anyone here use rTorrent?
06:02	<Led_Zeppelin>	hello, I am currently running Debian, and would like to try Ubuntu. Is it possible to install it without a CD?
06:02	<dmb062082>	Ubunto wont let me select a res higher than 800x600, not sure where this came from, as I have higher options selected in xserver-xorg configuration files, and frankly am going on a 2nd install onto a bigger partition, same pc and I was fine before.. any0ne? =(

06:03	<spikeb>	Led_Zeppelin, i dont think so
06:03	<spikeb>	Led_Zeppelin, love your nick btw :)
06:03	<lastnode>	Led_Zeppelin, you can
06:03	<Led_Zeppelin>	similar to bootstrapping it.
06:03	<Xylene>	so creative :/
06:03	<lastnode>	Led_Zeppelin, ever used debootstrap?
06:03	<andrejkw>	I installed XGL and Compiz, and now nobody can connect to my Remote Desktop. How can I fix this?
06:03	<ocult>	where i get skype?
06:03	<fatalblu>	Led_Zeppelin: you can try pointing apt at the ubuntu sources, good luck with that though i'd probably backup first

06:03	<krazykit>	Corey: still?  sheesh.  best i can tell you know is to use dpkg to reconfigure your xserver, but i honestly don't know the command.
06:03	<Hobbsee>	!xcfg
06:03	<ubotu>	hmm... xcfg is to reconfigure your xserver, open a terminal and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
06:03	<lastnode>	Led_Zeppelin, debootstrap has a breezy script. so use that, and then dist-upgrade to dapper
06:03	<saif>	ocult, from the skype website, i got it, it doesn't work though :S
06:03	<ompaul>	cheers Hobbsee
06:03	<Led_Zeppelin>	lastnode: ha! simple as that?

06:06	<bego>	hello

06:06	<dapper_drake_ins>	I did the CD check thing and they are corrupted
06:06	<Elops>	fatalblu, why not?
06:06	<dapper_drake_ins>	whats the probability the image I DL'ed is corrupt?
06:06	<glxblt>	Is the old installer still available on the desktop image?

06:07	<Hobbsee>	bego: this is a suppor channel.

06:07	<Hobbsee>	bego: this is a support channel.  It is not a social channel

06:13	<fatalblu>	real men don't need a computer or irc client, they just chew on network cable
=== jimaagic is now known as Katu
06:13	<bbrazil>	Kiko0123: alternate is a text-only installer
06:13	<Kiko0123>	altername = installation cd and desktop = live ?
06:13	<salman>	Dkt: maybe you have no codec available?
06:14	<bbrazil>	Kiko0123: all of them are live+install aiui
06:14	<salman>	look at properties
06:14	<Kiko0123>	humk
06:14	<stasislove>	fatalblu, there is a module there calld nvidia but its wrong, and i tried to write whole path there to the right module but it didt work, i suspect nvidia module is a link linked to wrong module, but where do  i find nvidia ?
06:14	<MrKeuner>	csko/ experts do not ask much questions :)
06:14	<Dkt>	salman, Probably.
06:14	<Kiko0123>	humk...why did they changed the names :P
06:14	<xiko>	hmm update manager says I have the latest version, but it is not Dapper for sure
06:14	<csko>	grr
06:14	<tubbie>	how do I install libcairo compiled with gcc4?
06:14	<fatalblu>	statislove: if you are daring you could rip it out of /lib/modules and put the right one in it's place
06:15	<salman>	Dkt, what is the format/video codec?
06:15	<csko>	how can i install with expert mode if i downloaded the Desktop iso?
06:15	<Shaezsche>	the video player that comes in ubuntu sucks
06:15	<Dkt>	salman, its .m3u
06:15	<damo21>	how do i go from breezy to dapper
06:15	<another>	is there a way to use "global" keyboard shortcuts in rhythmbox? things that would work even if rhythmbox is not in focus?
06:15	<Grunt>	hi, does anyone know if xgl is available for Dapper
06:16	<stasislove>	fatalblu, so nvidia link is in /lib/modules? i can just make a link calld nvidia poiting to right module there cant i ?
06:16	<MrKeuner>	Grunt/ no it is not
06:16	<krazykit>	Grunt: it is.
06:16	<hypnox>	Shaezsche there is more than one
06:16	<salman>	awww. it's a playlist format
06:16	<kspath>	!tell damo21 about upgrade
06:16	<nosilver4u>	i'm dist-upgrading to dapper, and it fails on lvm2 with this message: dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/lvm2_2.02.02-1ubuntu1_i386.deb (--install):
06:16	<nosilver4u>	 subprocess pre-installation script returned error exit status 10
06:16	<Grunt>	is there a link for it or can i use apt-get
06:16	<nosilver4u>	any ideas?
06:16	<EvilGrin>	I've upgraded to dapper but my soundcard hasn't been setup correctly. Its a Soundblaster Live. What do I need to do to fix it?
06:16	<jorgp>	damo21: in /etc/apt/sources.list, change everything that says breezy to dapper, then do a apt-get update ; apt-get dist-upgrade
06:16	<salman>	look at properties. what is video-codec?
06:17	<Ademan>	if I have dapper beta on this machine, and i've been keeping up with the automatic updates, do i now have dapper full?
06:17	<Elops>	what's the diffrance between edubunto and xubuntu and keubuntu
06:17	<h3sp4wn>	stasislove: You don't want to mess with /lib/modules - install nvidia-glx and linux-restricted-modules
06:17	<hypnox>	Ademan yes
06:17	<joachim-n>	what is 'breezy-updates repository' called in Synaptic's list?
06:17	<Ademan>	yay
06:17	<nevchen>	Elops,  kubuntu is with kde
06:17	<frank_>	Elops: kubuntu is with kde, xubuntu with xfce and edu is for schools
06:17	<krazykit>	Elops: ubuntu is gnome, kubuntu is kde, xubuntu is xfce, and edubuntu is indended for schools/education
06:17	<Dkt>	salman, It cant find any info about that.
06:17	<Grunt>	Is Ruby on the Rails avaliable for Dapper (a version which is actually compatible)
06:17	<Ademan>	unfortunately pcma isnt working, haha
06:17	<Howdy125>	New partitioner is a nightmare :-o
06:18	<PPower>	jorgp: replace everything to its original and then run something that i will look up for you
06:18	<Shaezsche>	this is no where near as user friendly as windows xp, im sorry but ubuntu is at least 10 years behind winxp
06:18	<fatalblu>	statislove: locate nvidia, look for the object file in /lib/modules replace reboot
06:18	<tubbie>	damnit. I need a kernel compiled with gcc-3.4 :(
06:18	<tubbie>	how?
06:18	<nevchen>	Howdy125,  espresso?
06:18	<stasislove>	fatalblu, allright in /lib/modules in a folder there is the right module, but it is not the one loading, there must be another file somewhere else...
06:18	<pc22>	krazykit, whats cool with xubuntu?
06:18	<Elops>	what makes edubuntu unique?
06:18	<PPower>	tubbie: why?
06:18	<kneskade>	Anyone here who can tell my why my 6.06 desktop install cd fails after the first boot menu on my powermac G4 (agp graphics) (the screen show's nothing, and the cd spins down, and yes i have tryed "live video=ofonly")
06:18	<jra>	is that the same partitioner as with debian testing?
06:18	<kspath>	pc22: try it
06:18	<Elops>	apart that its edu?
06:18	<fatalblu>	Shaezsche: since when is a blue screen of death user friendly
06:18	<ben42>	which ldap-server you would recommend in a small environment? package slapd oder package ultrapossum-server?
06:18	<issaker>	hey all
06:18	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: care to back up your criticism?
06:18	<tubbie>	vmware need cairo2. and cairo2 is compiled with gcc-3.4
06:18	<Shaezsche>	i never see those
06:18	<tubbie>	:(
06:18	<fatalblu>	statislove: dunno, all modules should be in there
06:18	<issaker>	how do i install a package with .run?
06:18	<stasislove>	h3sp4wn, tried that did't work, now i compiled from nvidia.com and it works, but i have to load right module manually
06:18	<joachim-n>	what's the text file for repositories?
06:18	<Shaezsche>	ademan ubuntu doesnt recognize 1/3 of my hardware
06:18	<PPower>	tubbie: dunno
06:18	<Elops>	what makes edubuntu unique?
06:18	<MrObvious>	issaker: Which package?
06:19	<Shaezsche>	i shouldnt have to learn how to compile kernals just to use ubuntu
06:19	<Howdy125>	nevchen, I don't know what it's called .. lol
06:19	<user1>	oola
06:19	<issaker>	this game called tremulous
06:19	<issaker>	Mrobvious
06:19	<user1>	hello alll
06:19	<nevchen>	Howdy125,  desktop-cd or alternative-cd?
06:19	<MrObvious>	Probably the sh command
06:19	<NoUse>	!tell Elops about edubuntu
06:19	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: i havent compiled a kernel ONCE, and what hardware isnt it detecting?
06:19	<fatalblu>	Shaezsche you don't have to, why am I arguing? la la la laa laa laa , laaa lalalala
06:19	<Shaezsche>	well my modem for one
06:19	<fatalblu>	^smurfs song
06:19	<Howdy125>	nevchen, desktop-cd
06:19	<issaker>	mrobvious the sh command?
06:19	<rendo>	Is Dapper totally pwnt?
06:19	<Shaezsche>	improperly detects graphics, none of the buttons on my laptop work
06:19	<rendo>	I'm burning the iso right now. :b
06:19	<nevchen>	ok it's espresso
06:19	<nevchen>	:-)
06:19	<Shaezsche>	built in webcam doesnt work
06:19	<user1>	192.168.1.128 enter
06:19	<Shaezsche>	sd card reader doesnt work
06:19	<Shaezsche>	among others
06:20	<salman>	dkt: my suggestion is just using mplayer or xine instead of VLC
06:20	<salman>	:(
06:20	<axisys>	i have 5.10.. isee so many procedures for upgrade.. what is the recommnded way to upgrade to dapper
06:20	<hypnox>	Shaezsche contact your laptop manufacturer
06:20	<PPower>	nevchen: no longer. i think its ubuntu express
06:20	<Dkt>	salman, I will try :) Thanks.
06:20	<fatalblu>	http://127.0.0.1 is the best
06:20	<Shaezsche>	why? linux is NEVER officially supported
06:20	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: OH, its a laptop, you know the only reason laptops work under windows is because laptop distrubutors create SPECIALIZED distributions of windows preinstalled on their machines...
06:20	<PPower>	axisys: update your update manager and then choose check
06:20	<EvilGrin>	I've upgraded to dapper but my soundcard hasn't been setup correctly. Its a Soundblaster Live. What do I need to do to fix it?
06:20	<Shaezsche>	its an asus w5a
06:20	<krazykit>	Shaezsche: exotic/brand new hardware?  no surprise there.
06:20	<salman>	mplayer is good about error massage thing
06:20	<abeck_>	 which version of VNC do you guys think is best?
06:20	<frank_>	Shaezsche: two things still are lacking with Linux support: hardware support in cases the manufacturers don't release linux drivers or specs and proprietary software the publisher doesn't port to linux.
06:20	<PPower>	axisys: for updates in the update checker
06:20	<hypnox>	Shaezsche it will be once it starts hurting their sales
06:20	<fatalblu>	abeck_ probably freenx
06:21	<jra>	and that's not even vnc, haha
06:21	<axisys>	PPower: how do i go by update my update manager.. soryy newbie
06:21	<frank_>	Shaezsche: If you buy hardware with linux support in mind. Ubuntu is a dream
06:21	<fatalblu>	jra: i know lol
06:21	<Shaezsche>	it will never hurt their sales
06:21	<hypnox>	Shaezsche not with that attitude!
06:21	<PPower>	axisys: open synaptic and choose the refresh button. then choose mark all upgrades
06:21	<Shaezsche>	well where can i find directions specifically for the w5a to work?
06:21	<Shaezsche>	they dont exist
06:21	<Madi>	hi

06:22	<h3sp4wn>	stasislove: what version of nvidia drivers are you trying to install ?
06:22	<Shaezsche>	its an asus laptop
06:22	<Shaezsche>	everyone knows that!
06:22	<fatalblu>	not helping....
06:22	<avalost>	does anyone use a nextel phone / data cable with linuc here?
06:22	<dontm>	hello all, anyone know of a more up to date ubuntu on a laptop resource than tuxmobil?  it's a lil outdated.  any good reviews/info etc would be appreciated.  thanks in advance

06:23	<fatalblu>	Good news! It's a suppository...
06:23	<brandon_>	happy dapper day!
06:23	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, no they don't, have you got a live CD?
06:23	<PPower>	everyone>	to upgrade to dapper type https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades into your browser
06:23	<yukonho>	I've been following that with no success :(
06:23	<Shaezsche>	yes!
06:23	<hypnox>	lol type into browser, welcome to internets
06:23	<h3sp4wn>	stasislove: Thats the exact same one that is in the repos
06:23	<visik7>	Coyctecm: in /boot/grub/menu.lst remove splash from the commandline
06:23	<WarOfAttrition>	you are much better off doing a fresh install
06:23	<jorgp>	gourdin: edgy
06:23	<Shaezsche>	ubuntu is useless without modem support, to me anyway
06:23	<stasislove>	h3sp4wn, repos?
06:23	<jra>	I'm gonna install -server on hppa, just to be unique. :)
06:23	<Coyctecm>	visik7: doesn't work :(
06:24	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, and when you put your CD in does the screen actually come up?
06:24	<dontm>	yukonho: use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
06:24	<gourdin>	jorgp: do edgy repo exists ?

06:24	<gourdin>	jorgp: 'k, thx
06:24	<PPower>	h3sp4wn: i had trouble with those nvidia drivers. i would run nvidias script
06:24	<visik7>	or at least for the one you use
06:24	<dontm>	yukonho: just change gb to us if ur in the states
06:24	<damo21>	any advantage in a clean install instead of breezy ->	dapper?
06:24	<ubuntu_vishal>	hi there
06:24	<wobedragg>	Anyone care to help me with an issue?
06:24	<PPower>	ok
06:24	<ubuntu_vishal>	no
06:24	<bbrazil>	wobedragg: just ask the question
06:24	<anto9us>	!ask
06:24	<ubotu>	For information on how to ask good questions please see http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html The more information you can give the better we can help you. If your going to give output of commands please use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
06:24	<fatalblu>	only if it's an issue of playboy
06:24	<Chobo-Mog>	Hey.  Could someone please help me with the Ubuntu installation?
06:25	<kspath>	damo21: You get to try the installer?
06:25	<Chobo-Mog>	Whenever I try and install Ubuntu it will always boot, and lead me through most of the installation process without a problem.  It does say that its setting up what seems like an endless list of components, and says [OK]  beside each.  However, after that the screen seems to refresh, and then just freezes on a blank, black screen.
06:25	<zjohnson>	silly question (but I did look at the ubuntu wiki for ans).. Can you just update the ubuntu 6.06beta to the full production dapper drake release?
06:25	<sladen>	Coyctecm: remote 'splash' from the kernel commandline
06:25	<Chobo-Mog>	It might be a compatibility issue with my hardware, since I had the same problem when I tried a friend's old Hoary Hedgehog CD last week, but it could be something completely different.  Any help would be appreciated ^___^
06:25	<xiko>	!disk space
06:25	<ubotu>	xiko: Not a clue. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
06:25	<hypnox>	zjohnson yeah
06:25	<Ademan>	Schaezche: you only have 56k?...
06:25	<Shaezsche>	yes!
06:25	<PPower>	wobedragg: whats the prob?
06:25	<h3sp4wn>	PPower: I never would the binary blobs will be identical - if you need to possibly use module-assistant to rebuild the kernel module
06:25	<Shaezsche>	i live in the woods
06:25	<Shaezsche>	i NEED modem support
06:25	<wobedragg>	k, I was updating from breezy to dapper this morning, and my laptop was unplugged accidentally, I recovered but now I'm stuck here  dpkg --configure -a Setting up samba (3.0.22-1ubuntu3) ...

06:26	<ompaul>	Shaezsche,  so your saying it does not start with the CD?
06:26	<Shaezsche>	vack?
06:26	<h3sp4wn>	PPower: They are identical look at the version numbers
06:26	<anto9us>	Chobo-Mog, detatch unnessary hardware and try disabling some features in the bios such as peripheral ports etc and try again, it may help you isolate the problem.
06:26	<Shaezsche>	i can install ubuntu, it just doestn recognize my modem
06:27	<PPower>	h3sp4wn: I dunno why. but as long as it works ;-D
06:27	<Shaezsche>	at all
06:27	<dontm>	good up to date ubuntu on laptop resource = ?
06:27	<cara>	Hi all
06:27	<MrObvious>	Shaezsche: Is it a winmodem?
06:27	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: what do you mean? download the windows driver on a windows machine, transfer it to your linux computer, find out the info as he said, then google for it and see if theres linux support
06:27	<JoeyB2>	!nvidia
06:27	<ubotu>	Help about installing the nVidia drivers on Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
06:27	<cara>	hmm
06:27	<dontm>	!laptop
06:27	<ubotu>	from memory, laptop is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops or http://www.linux-laptop.net/ or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam, or tuxmobil.org
06:27	<soundray>	Shaezsche: Winmodems are the devil's. Get a decent external one.
06:27	<Chobo-Mog>	Ok, I'll give that a shot.  Thank you
06:27	<OmniD>	quick somebody make a trillian clone
06:27	<jra>	Shaezsche: quit it. either get supported hardware or bug the manufacturer to release free specs but don't go blame linux or any distibution for that matter
06:27	<ompaul>	!winmodem
06:27	<ubotu>	[winmodem]  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto for instructions on setting up your modem (including winmodems). Additional info can be found at http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/
06:27	<damo21>	does the dapper installer have an option for xfce instead of gnome?
06:27	<Shaezsche>	i dont know if its a winmodem!, the linuxant thingy doesnt even recognize it
06:27	<h3sp4wn>	damo21: Use xubuntu
06:27	<rendo>	Is it dialup?
06:28	<Ademan>	jra: he's not really criticizing anymore, its fine, we might as well help
06:28	<rendo>	If so, quit being cheap and get DSL or Cable.
06:28	<cara>	Hmm does anyone use a touchpad?
06:28	<soundray>	Shaezsche: it is a winmodem. Get an external one, or a PCMCIA one if you have to.
06:28	<nollidj>	any advice for an old machine (300 mhz pentium ii) and getting it to be more responsive?
06:28	<WarOfAttrition>	Shaezsche|  you are much better off just replacing it with an external serial modem
06:28	<yukonho>	dontm: thanks, that's all I needed!
06:28	<MrObvious>	rendo: He's only got dialup because he lives too far out in the woods.
06:28	<damo21>	is there a separate iso for xubuntu 6.06? is there such a thing?
06:28	<rendo>	Get Satellite. :P
06:28	<Grunt>	are there instructions for install Xgl on dapper
06:28	<jra>	nollidj: yeah, get rid of gnome.
06:28	<stjepan>	is dapper released?
06:28	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, ask the manfacturer -- fpr the info and I concur with WarOfAttrition
06:28	<rendo>	stjepan Yes
06:28	<soundray>	yes, Grunt
06:28	<ompaul>	stjepan, /topic ;-)
06:28	<soundray>	!tell Grunt about xgl
06:28	<MrObvious>	damo21: What do you mean a seperate ISO?
06:28	<xiko>	jesus i LOVE apt, it is the most amazing thing ever. Thats it, im keeping my old hd for games only. Im ubuntu for work forever now
06:28	<Shaezsche>	well my modem isnt the only issue, it also doesnt properly support the intel 915 integrated graphics
06:29	<nollidj>	jra: hmm, the xfce desktop just isn't put together as well, and this is supposed to be a desktop for people who aren't very computer-literate.  any other suggestions?
06:29	<rendo>	AFK installing Dapper :b
06:29	<eXIstenZ>	Can anyone send me his repos, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 doesn't work.
06:29	<pike__>	damo21: well you can type server at bootup that will just install base and then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
06:29	<Shaezsche>	detects it as 815 and gives me all kidns of issues
06:29	<revmouse>	nollidj, try using xubuntu, its an ubuntu system geared to be more lightweight
06:29	<damo21>	thanks pike
06:29	<nollidj>	revmouse: is this a separate distro?
06:29	<issaker>	can someone tell me how to execute a .run package?

06:29	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: like what sort of issues?
06:29	<PPower>	xubuntu found at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
06:29	<dontm>	eXIstenZ: : use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
06:29	<nollidj>	issaker: it is probably a self-extracting shell script.  try '/bin/sh blah.run'
06:29	<cara>	Was wondering if I could isntall ubuntu from the live cd
06:29	<kspath>	nollidj: generic advice, max RAM and min what is running on it  perhaps no X
06:29	<Shaezsche>	like it says LCD ON every 5 minutes
06:29	<voraistos>	sh xxx.run
06:29	<damo21>	i thought dapper was going to release an xubuntu
06:29	<hazart>	issaker: chmod +x the file and ./<filename>	it
06:29	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, the importance of getting supported hardware, however that being said work on one issue at a time, now go find out about your modem
06:29	<Grunt>	Soundray: sorry whats does the !tell mean
06:29	<revmouse>	nollidj, well you can type server at bootup that will just install base and then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
06:29	<Ademan>	cara: the dapper live yes
06:30	<nollidj>	hmm
06:30	<PPower>	issaker: just run it like a normal sh. ./(script)
06:30	<eXIstenZ>	dontm, that is for dapper?
06:30	<dontm>	eXIstenZ: : just change gb to us if ur in the states
06:30	<nollidj>	i guess i'll flatten and reinstall, then
06:30	<Shaezsche>	ompaul what is the sudo command?
06:30	<DBO>	!sudo
06:30	<ubotu>	I heard sudo is a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
06:30	<dontm>	eXIstenZ: yes look at the url, see the word "dapper" in the comments? =-)
06:30	<soundray>	Grunt: it means that I asked the bot to send you a private message. Look around your IRC client, you should see it.
06:30	<cara>	guess I could go ahead an bunr the regular disk to a disk
06:30	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, look I am going to get the bot to message you all the info you want is there
06:30	<eXIstenZ>	dontm, oh yeah :)
06:30	<damo21>	YAYYY Xubuntu 6.06!!!!
06:30	<revmouse>	yay!
06:30	<Shaezsche>	lol
06:30	<issaker>	ppower thanks that did the trick what does sh do?
06:30	<TheMadman>	you can cheat on the live cd and type sudo setuser root
06:30	<MrObvious>	damo21: What do you mean a seperate ISO?
06:31	<orangehaw>	Help wanted: my toshiba M60-171 with resolution 1440x900 (wxga) produces startup sounds but no screen
06:31	<Grunt>	Soundray: brilliant thanks for the link
06:31	<anto9us>	nollidj, you can disable some gnome features such as animations and draw windows while draggin by using configuration editor
06:31	<eigenlambda>	lol... i love torrence...
06:31	<damo21>	MrObvious: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
06:31	<PPower>	issaker: sh is a shell that linux uses. a sh is a type of script
06:31	<nollidj>	ugh... is there a non-https access to wiki.ubuntu.com?
06:31	<tbenita>	hi, can upgrade to lts by chaging breezy to lts in the sources.list and apt-get dist-upgrade ?
06:31	<eigenlambda>	now, to hope that ubuntu deals with my usb mouse properly
06:31	<Ademan>	the dapper install cd is limping along at 8kb/s (its a torrent too)
06:31	<DBO>	orangehaw, does CTRL + ALT + F1 get you a console?
06:31	<dontm>	tbenita: yes
06:31	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, please don't use that word it is derogatory
06:31	<orangehaw>	DBO: yes
06:31	<nollidj>	anto9us: already done... this is just dog-slow, more or less, and the idea is to change it from fat lazy dog-slow to middle-aged suffering from arthritis dog-slow
06:31	<axisys>	i get this error when running gksudo update-manager but it did not upgrade to dapper .. http://pastebin.com/751596
06:31	<tbenita>	ok thanks dontm
06:31	<issaker>	gahhhhh
06:31	<hazart>	Will, the dapper repository stay "stable" and not upgrade package versions? In other words, should i add any edgy sources to my list?
06:32	<nzt>	sorry bad request
06:32	<DBO>	orangehaw, can you put your gdm and xorg logs on patebin from me?
06:32	<issaker>	ppower, now when i install i get no write permission
06:32	<anto9us>	nollidj, if you can lay your hands on more memory that will make a big difference
06:32	<KhZillu>	whats this SMP PREEMPT kernel?
06:32	<wastrel>	well howdy everybody
06:32	<stasislove>	so if i have a module in a directory, there is no way to start it when ubuntu starts?
06:32	<nollidj>	anto9us: i've already hit this machine's maximum memory capacity
06:32	<damo21>	MrObvious: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
06:32	<DBO>	orangehaw, can you put your gdm and xorg logs on patebin for me?  (fixed dumb typo)
06:32	<KhZillu>	its the plain i686 but it hast the SMP PREEMPT tag on it.
06:32	<nollidj>	it's the cpu that's killing it, and it's an old laptop
06:32	<PPower>	issaker: what package is it
06:32	<deus_>	is is out?
06:32	<orangehaw>	DBO: there's no way to paste it on pastebin since i have no inet & screen yet ;(
06:32	<issaker>	ppower what do you mean?
06:32	<Shaezsche>	http://www.linmodems.org/ the scan modem tool here is broken
06:32	<soundray>	stasislove: there is -- you could add an insmod command to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
06:32	<anto9us>	nollidj, if you have another HD kicking around you could configure a raid 0, that will speed things up
06:32	<deus_>	is dapper released?
06:32	<hazart>	Will the dapper repos. still contain new packages, or will there be a new one for edgy?
06:32	<nollidj>	anto9us: laptop
06:32	<issaker>	ppower its a game called tremulous
06:32	<PPower>	issaker: is it for java or a nvidia package.
06:33	<nollidj>	thanks, though
06:33	<krazykit>	hazart: it'll be fairly stable.  bug fixes and security fixes will be added, and there will be backports eventually.  for right now, there are no edgy repos
06:33	<nevchen>	deus_,  yeah
06:33	<NoUse>	deus_ read the topic
06:33	<h3sp4wn>	stasislove: just add it to the bottom of /etc/modules is the easiest way
06:33	<dontm>	just a fyi to the ops: dapperupgrade wiki page = typos on command lines and the url w/ the source list is down
06:33	<DBO>	orangehaw, ok, do a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and when you select the driver, select VESA
06:33	<PPower>	issaker: right. try sudo ./blah.run. enter your password. you need to be in the folder where the run is
06:33	<stasislove>	soundray, i use insmod to start it, but when i reboot i have to do insmod again
06:33	<MrObvious>	Got it damo
06:33	<orangehaw>	DBO: I ran the xserver-xorg for the correct resolution, but nothings happens. Not even errors for as far as I can see
06:33	<MrObvious>	I keep d/cing
06:33	<krazykit>	hazart: edgy won't be started on for a couple weeks yet, i hear.
06:33	<MrObvious>	damo21: I think it's just one ISO for your architecture
=== ccc__ is now known as ccc_
06:33	<soundray>	stasislove: read my line carefully
06:33	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: what makes you say that?
06:33	<antimoof>	as http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 is being utterly thrashed, are there any mirrors of that file around?
06:33	<hazart>	krazykit: okay, but if i don't change my sources i will be stuck with gnome 2.14 and the current version apps that i have now?
06:34	<stasislove>	soundray, sorry
06:34	<wastrel>	oh i forgot dapper's out
06:34	<PPower>	issaker: did it work
06:34	<Shaezsche>	say what?
06:34	<fatalblu>	out like a boner in sweatpants
06:34	<davidhouse>	hi guys. how can i get apt to give me a list of the currently installed packages?
06:34	<dontm>	antimoof:  use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
06:34	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: that the modem detector is broken
06:34	<DShepherd>	wastrel: forget no more! :-)
06:34	<damo21>	MrObvious: im just really excited because its the first ubuntu release with xfce as a separate release!!! Xubuntu 6.06!!!!
06:34	<pike__>	orangehaw: when you type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it should take you through a whole setup asking questions and stuff
06:34	<to0om>	hi folks, a question: why does the battery-panel in dapper always notify me that there are only 3 minutes left although the battery is almost full?
06:34	<xiko>	hmm how many packages to update dapper? right now m in number 195
06:34	<soundray>	Shaezsche: don't say lol when you should be saying thankyou
06:34	<AlienX>	davidhouse, dpkg -l
06:34	<Shaezsche>	oh, because when i dl it, it says the file is corrupt
06:34	<wastrel>	i just want my palm sync to work
06:34	<DShepherd>	damo21: :-)
06:34	<Shaezsche>	winrar wont open it
06:34	<krazykit>	hazart: um, yes... gnome 2.14 is the latest, you know.  you're not really "stuck" with it.
06:34	<NoUse>	davidhouse dpkg -l | grep ii
06:34	<orangehaw>	pike_: I know, did that
06:34	<Jowi>	orangehaw, DBO : if you get sound the xorg.conf should be configured somewhat right. i think it is the framebuffer that is not supported.  if you can, try to disable framebuffer in BIOS or in grub
06:34	<Ademan>	Shaezche: oh... lol
06:35	<simp>	emm... hello
06:35	<issaker>	ppower it says command not found
06:35	<bluefoxicy>	This channel is now about dapper  o.o
06:35	<xcomputerman>	ok, can someone give me a fast mirror? :)
=== IronMask is now known as IronMask|Sleep
06:35	<davidhouse>	NoUse, AlienX: brilliant, thanks.
06:35	<krazykit>	hazart: if you really want to be on the edge, wait for edgy eft to get it's repos started and migrate to that.
06:35	<xcomputerman>	all of them seem to be crawling.
06:35	<simp>	i have a little question
06:35	<orangehaw>	Jowi: i'll try that
06:35	<hazart>	krazykit: yes, it know, but i would like to have the 2.15.1 whenever it's released, if you know what i mean...
06:35	<DBO>	Jowi, you can also disable it in xserver reconfigure =P
06:35	<issaker>	sudo: ./tremulous-1.1.0-installer.x86.run: command not found
06:35	<AlienX>	davidhouse, np
06:35	<bbrazil>	xcomputerman: use bittorrent
06:35	<simp>	if i try to boot it says error loading OS... :S
06:35	<PPower>	issaker: can we do private msg as it is getting a bit to crouded
06:35	<xcomputerman>	bbrazil: can't, i'm at work.
06:35	<dontm>	xcomputerman:  use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
06:35	<krazykit>	hazart: hah, than wait for edgy.  you'll last a few weeks til' it's up :-P
06:35	<jra>	"a bit".. how cute
06:35	<xcomputerman>	dontm: i need an iso.
06:35	<simp>	h3sp4wn are you here anyway?
06:36	<hazart>	krazykit: okay, that's nice! I really love the simplicity og the ubuntu/debian package system :)
06:36	<issaker>	ppower sure
06:36	<dontm>	xcomputerman: bit torrent buddy heh
06:36	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: frankly, ubuntu is an absolute dream on desktops, but on laptops its a nightmare, i'm on a laptop now, it took me about 2 months to get it up (well, really i was butting my head up against a wall, it only worked because i switched from breezy to dapper)
06:36	<xcomputerman>	dontm: bittorrent not allowed here at work
06:36	<ompaul>	xcomputerman, waith until the weekend is over and it should be easier to get one
06:36	<dontm>	xcomputerman: u hard set on fresh install? why not just upgrade?
06:36	<krazykit>	hazart: just remember, edgy will by syncing with debian sid, and it'll be rather unstable at first.
06:36	<jra>	calling dpkg simplistic is funny
06:36	<xcomputerman>	dontm: because it is a fresh install :)
06:36	<h3sp4wn>	simp: What do you need ?
06:36	<dontm>	xcomputerman: oh work bummer
06:36	<antimoof>	muchas gracia, dontm.
06:36	<Shaezsche>	anyone know if cedega works with oblivion yet?
06:36	<ro>	Ademan: Set it up on two laptops no problem, I think it's pot luck really : )
06:36	<Thib_G>	Someone could give me linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-22-686 and the older version of nvidia-glx, please ?
06:36	<simp>	join #something can you?
06:36	<dontm>	antimoof: de nada
06:36	<DBO>	Shaezsche, no it does not
06:36	<Jowi>	DBO: yeah, but it should not be neccessary to set the server to vesa. most likely the correct driver is in use for xorg.
06:36	<soundray>	simp: have you got grub installed?
06:36	<hazart>	krazykit: it's just that i just switched my amd64 from gentoo to ubunty, and i am used to run breakmygentoo overlays, so i miss the edge :P
06:36	<simp>	yes i do soundray
06:36	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: I saw someone in a forum claimed to have been doing it
06:37	<rendo>	Question to the smart peoples!
06:37	<RodrigoX>	why "dont use dapper, use torrent"?
06:37	<soundray>	simp: is grub giving you the error?
06:37	<joachim-n>	the upgrade wiki page is wrong
06:37	<anto9us>	Thib_G, packages.ubuntu.com has all packages for all releases available
06:37	<RodrigoX>	my download in torrent is too suckz =X
06:37	<indro>	krazykit: edgy will by syncing with debian sid <- why do you know that?
06:37	<dontm>	xcomputerman: im assuming u tried all the mirrors on the wiki page?
06:37	<rendo>	With Nero Burning rom, burning the 6.06.iso to a DVD what format should I use so it's bootable so I can install the damn thing on boot frm disc?
06:37	<xcomputerman>	one by one, man. one by one.
06:37	<krazykit>	indro: because that's what they do.
06:37	<DBO>	Jowi, you are corect on that, I set it to VESA just to knock things as far down as I can then re-enable things one at a time
06:37	<damo21>	xubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso !!!!!!!!
06:37	<olivier>	 /msg ubotu upgrade
06:37	<Ohzie>	I have a question: How many people's update killed their system's x-server?
06:37	<Thib_G>	anto9us: No, there is only the last versions and kernels
06:37	<tristanmike>	rendo, did you download the cd or dvd image ?
06:37	<Jowi>	DBO: vesa always work :)
06:37	<xcomputerman>	best i've gotten is releases.ubuntu.com, actually
06:37	<dontm>	!upgrade
06:38	<KhZillu>	Ohzie I'll find out soon enough
06:38	<ubotu>	upgrade is probably Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
06:38	<jra>	rendo: what format options you got?
06:38	<rendo>	There's a DVD image?
06:38	<DBO>	Ohzie, did you have manually installed ATI or Nvidia drivers?
06:38	<krazykit>	indro: that's how all the releases start, by syncing with sid, then going from there.
06:38	<semq>	update manager not working (1 file missing)
06:38	<fiete>	Hi! The graphical installer hangs on "configuring apt...". Any ideas?
06:38	<xcomputerman>	chugging at 170KB/sec
06:38	<rendo>	God dmanit :P
06:38	<DBO>	Jowi, thats the idea =)
06:38	<xiko>	I just edited /etc/apt/sources.list substituting breezy with dapper
06:38	<hazart>	krazykit: But maybe it's time to settle down for some stability after all :D - ubuntu really offers a bit of everything. The only thing i miss is the ability to select which features packages should come with. Like gentoo's USE flags.
06:38	<tristanmike>	rendo, yup
06:38	<xiko>	it is updating right now
06:38	<tiger>	I want a program to run when system starts up, how do I do that?
06:38	<rendo>	There was ISO, UDF and something else, guess I need the DVD image. :P
06:38	<Ohzie>	DBO: I did, but changing the driver back to vga doesn't help at all. Same error.
06:38	<rendo>	Bwahahha.
06:38	<indro>	krazykit: okay, thanks krazykit
06:38	<rixxon>	the movie preview in nautilus shows the middle of the movie?
06:38	<DBO>	Ohzie, what error?
06:38	<Ace2005>	i just updated to dapper and nvidia drivers won't work, i'm using nv at the moment
06:38	<tristanmike>	rendo, well, you can't burn a cd iso to a dvd if that's what your asking
06:38	<AlienX>	are there dapper dvd isos out?
06:38	<ompaul>	Ohzie, if you have ati or nividia you have to do that make ati work >>sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<<
06:38	<jlmr>	hi
06:38	<jlmr>	i have a small problem
06:38	<rendo>	I sure can. :P
06:38	<frank_>	Ademan: well I you choose your laptop with linux support in mind, it must be easier setting it up. If you have graphics, sound, network and mouse working out of the box (I'm it's doable) it would be easier
06:38	<rendo>	It doesn't work though. :P
06:38	<tristanmike>	rendo, touche :P
06:38	<hazart>	would it be possible to switch a debian machine to ubuntu with dist-upgrade?
06:39	<Ohzie>	DBO: "No screens found"
06:39	<Ace2005>	Anyone else have any problems with nvidia after updating?
06:39	<jlmr>	when installing ubuntu, grub was installed to my MBR, and i dont want it there
06:39	<rendo>	I was fiddling in the bios wondering why it wasn't picking up.
06:39	<AlienX>	hazart, no you'll break stuff
06:39	<rendo>	OH well, download download download!
06:39	<frank_>	Ademan: although I must say I only tried Ubuntu on my desktop
06:39	<krazykit>	hazart: hrm, it used to be a supported migration path, but it might be easier to just reinstall
06:39	<hazart>	From 2.4 debian sarge to dapper drake LTS
06:39	<DBO>	Ohzie, do what ompaul said "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
06:39	<NoUse>	AlienX http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/release/
06:39	<ro>	anyone know how to open an app in 8bit depth with regards to x?
06:39	<krazykit>	hazart: no, there's no supported path for that.
06:39	<soundray>	hazart: not with recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu
06:39	<hazart>	Bugger, it's a very hard machine to reinstall.
06:39	<AlienX>	NoUse, thanks
06:39	<Soir>	hmm, does ubuntu have XGL anywhere yet?
06:39	<jlmr>	now, my question is, if i backup my MBR using dd (446 bytes etc), can ntldr use it to boot ubuntu?
06:39	<wastrel>	!tell jlmr about fixmbr
06:39	<NoUse>	!tell Soir about xgl
06:39	<Ng>	Soir: it's in universe. see #ubuntu-xgl
06:39	<xcomputerman>	oh, there are dvd images?
06:39	<xcomputerman>	crap.
06:39	<hazart>	But ubuntu seems worth it.
06:39	<DBO>	thanks ompaul =P
06:39	<xcomputerman>	wish i'd known
06:40	<DBO>	Soir, #ubuntu-xgl
06:40	<DBO>	oops, Ng beat me
06:40	<krazykit>	jlmr: there IS a way to make ntldr do it, but afaik, it's a pain in the butt.  i'm sure it's around on google though
06:40	<Soir>	mm, just that it does; that's what I was asking ^^
06:40	<hazart>	the others laughed at me when i installed the first ubuntu server, but look whos laughing now :) LTS is great!
06:40	<mada>	heh, i figured it would a be a "break out the booze" attitude in here all day
06:40	<mada>	Dapper dominates
06:40	<Soir>	certainly not production ready
06:40	<ompaul>	xcomputerman, can you auto replace any swear words your likley to utter in irc with something more friendly please
06:40	<krazykit>	hazart: if you try to do that, i'll guarantee breakage.  but go ahead and try!  it'll be fun.
06:40	<troytroy>	hi need pkg to create virtual cdrom
06:40	<DBO>	mada, try mad tech support rush
06:40	<hazart>	krazykit: Hehe, no, it's an important production system.
06:40	<xcomputerman>	ompaul: err, what?
06:41	<troytroy>	like daemon tools in windows
06:41	<DBO>	troytroy, you mean an ISO?
06:41	<mada>	DBO: fair enough
06:41	<jdmpike>	bummer - no nxserver support
06:41	<hazart>	krazykit: to bad we don't have a spare machine for seamless migration. We really need SATA support in it soon, and that reguires 2.6 kernel.
06:41	<neutrinomass>	I'm going to buy some PCI ethernet cards... any advice as to Linux compatability ?
06:41	<soundray>	xcomputerman: don't play dumb, I saw it too.
06:41	<troytroy>	yes and make images
06:41	<frank_>	troytroy: you can mount iso directly. Or you can google for cdemu for a virtual drive
06:41	<mada>	DBO: i'll hang for a little bit and see if there is anything i can lend a hand at :)
06:41	<xcomputerman>	soundray: what did i say?
06:41	<rendo>	Hrm.
06:41	<rendo>	Is it quicker to go find a blank CD?
06:41	<rendo>	Or is it quicker to download the DVD iso :/
06:41	<h3sp4wn>	jdmpike: sevas has repos for dapper of freenx
=== jimbo is now known as linuxgrooven
06:41	<hazart>	krazykit: and debian unstable is just not the same as dapper LTS.
06:42	<soundray>	xcomputerman: I'm too posh and too lazy to repeat it to you. ;)
06:42	<mada>	rendo: find a blank cd
06:42	<krazykit>	hazart: i know.
06:42	<com4>	I have had trac on my server running fine for the past few months. I just dist-upgraded and now apache segfaults everytime someone hits a trac page.
06:42	<jdmpike>	h3sp4n, I have included a mirror to it, it just doesn't work for me....
06:42	<h3sp4wn>	jdmpike: Only difference from the breezy one is ssh has to be bound to localhost also
06:42	<rendo>	I probably don't have any left. :/
06:42	<xcomputerman>	"crap" is a swear word? or is someone seeing things?
06:42	<Ng>	neutrinomass: Intel ones seem to be pretty well supported

06:42	<com4>	That's the error
06:42	<Ng>	xcomputerman: it is
06:42	<soundray>	xcomputerman: yes, it is.
06:42	<ompaul>	xcomputerman, your one word comment in -- minute 39
06:42	<jdmpike>	h3sp4wn, what do you mean?
06:42	<hazart>	krazykit: got to go grab some coffe and start reading math, thanks for your support.

06:42	<davidhouse>	what do the first two characters of each line mean in dpkg -l? i can't find the information in the manpage for some reason
06:43	<ro>	xcomputerman: no it isn't. Or maybe it's a cultur thing : )

06:43	<xcomputerman>	i'm like ...geez, are you guys uptight or what
06:43	<ratorro>	3jheddd
06:43	<orangehaw>	Jowi: no frame buffer options in my toshiba laptop. I'm trying with the no stretch function now (since it's 1440x900) on wxga

06:43	<mada>	mjmac: why*
06:43	<h3sp4wn>	jdmpike: try telnet 127.0.0.1 22 (if it is listening then you don't have the problem I did)
06:43	<pike__>	TheMadman: good plan
06:43	<mada>	TheMadman: good idea

06:43	<Stormx2>	Dude
06:43	<hypnox>	xcomputerman are you uptight about some people here being uptight?
06:43	<Stormx2>	I missed the dapper release!
06:44	<Stormx2>	:(
06:44	<xcomputerman>	hypnox: nah, i'm just astonished.
06:44	<Frogzoo_away>	TheMadman: agreed - ATI have lost the plot
06:44	<mada>	Stormx2: no you didn't ... its still in the same day :)
06:44	<krazykit>	Stormx2: it's not like you still can't download it though :-P
06:44	<hypnox>	xcomputerman well different strokes and all that
06:44	<soundray>	Stormx2: why, no, it's today, let's celebrate!
06:44	<mjmac>	mada: because when i upgraded my AMD64 box from breezy->dapper, it refuses to boot.  i suspect a lilo problem.  it loads the kernel, but then locks solid when it should be uncompressing/mounting the initrd
06:44	<Stormx2>	:D
06:44	<Stormx2>	Did shuttlesmurf come on IRC to tell us all?
06:44	<bosco>	so dapper official came out now
06:44	<mada>	mjmac: not a bad reason to need a rescue disk ... :/
06:44	<Jowi>	orangehaw: in /boot/grub/menu.lst you can add "vga=normal" as a kernel option (for example put it after the root=/dev/blah entry)
06:44	<krazykit>	bosco: yes, yes it did.
06:45	<ompaul>	xcomputerman, I am not uptight, I just want a G rated channel
06:45	<bosco>	what time did it come out ??? :) i had to work
06:45	<ro>	I have a program which will only run in 8bit depth, naturally I don't want to run everything in 8bit. Any ideas?
06:45	<Jowi>	orangehaw: "no stretch" sound good :)
06:45	<orangehaw>	Jowi: okay, i'll do that
06:45	<apokryphos>	Stormx2: yes, but not in here
06:45	<sweetnjguy29>	I thiought Linux was X windows rated
06:45	<DShepherd>	Stormx2: :-) never mind.. good thing dapper is still here
06:45	<DShepherd>	Stormx2: they told me no
06:45	<DShepherd>	bosco: yup
06:45	<krazykit>	bosco: dunno, several hours ago, i think.  it released when i was asleep
06:45	<ompaul>	bosco, now - 7 hours there abouts
06:45	<jdmpike>	h3sp4wn, if I try to ssh to 127.0.0.1 it just hangs... doesn't allow me to connect
06:45	<h3sp4wn>	jdmpike: Do you use ssh keys ? have you tried running sudo nxsetup ?
06:45	<kspath>	xcomputerman: funny part is I have seen people with their nickname being or containing the french or spanish words for excrement/feces.
06:45	<Jowi>	orangehaw: or vga=ask, that will give you some choices at boot
06:45	<ompaul>	kspath, tell me :-)
06:46	<anto9us>	ro, you can have another login and switch its resolution to 8 bit depth
06:46	<jdmpike>	h3sp4wn, I have tried running nxsetup, it fails though
06:46	<Stormx2>	Well shiver my timbers 
06:46	<bosco>	krazykit, you cant download it from ubuntu.com right now they are down for mantiance
06:46	<bosco>	:(
06:46	<orangehaw>	Jowi: no stretch didn't do the trick, trying the vga options now
06:46	<Ace2005>	how do you scroll up in a terminal, i'm trying to go up in Ctrl+Alt+F6
06:46	<tRSS>	i am unable to access this site http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 so that I can update my sources.list
06:46	<DBO>	jdmpike, if you ssh -vv 127.0.0.1 you might get a better idea where its failing out
06:46	<Beginer>	When I try to access my Windows partitions while I am using Ubuntu 6.06 Live CD I got error message that I can't access because it is not removeable drive.Why is that?
06:46	<mjmac>	ok, perhaps i am being a dolt, but i do not see a boot: prompt with this new dapper install cd.  i know how to use a rescue disk, normally.
06:46	<soundray>	Ace2005: shift-pgup
06:46	<krazykit>	bosco: orly.  well, lemme see if i have a mirror link handy, and then you can get a torrent
06:46	<rendo>	Is there any way to upgrade to Dapper without using the .iso file?
06:46	<bosco>	krazykit, ok thanks
06:46	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell bosco about torrent
06:46	<soundray>	Ace2005: doesn't work once you switched away from it
06:46	<tRSS>	is there any other place or way I can get the updated sources.list
06:47	<voraistos>	rendo yea
06:47	<apokryphos>	heh, channel keeps growing 8)
06:47	<rendo>	Omg, how :P
06:47	<Ace2005>	oh
06:47	<Frogzoo_away>	!tell krazykit  about torrent
06:47	<DBO>	rendo, yes, you can modify your sources.list
06:47	<apokryphos>	must be that /. influence in too
06:47	<bosco>	rendo,  just update your souces file
06:47	<Ace2005>	thanks for the info
06:47	<xcomputerman>	i can understand complaing about s*** or f*** (since i personally never use such words on irc myself), but man ... this one's pushing it
06:47	<jdmpike>	h3sp4wn, what do I need to do in my sshd_config to make it accept connections on 127.0.0.1?
06:47	<Ace2005>	i'll be back

06:47	<Frogzoo_away>	bosco: did you read the pm?

06:48	<lastnode>	Yorgos, please turn off mp3 scripts in #ubuntu channels
06:48	<DBO>	jdmpike, are you sure your SSH server is running?
06:48	<bosco>	Frogzoo_away, yes and i got it
06:48	<bosco>	thanks
06:48	<AskHL>	Hello, is it possible to install Xubuntu with a regular Dapper ISO or should I download the separate Xubuntu ISO? The point is that want a non-Xubuntu install and a Xubuntu one, so if one ISO is sufficient then that'll probably save some time.
06:48	<Yorgos>	i am still here?
06:48	<anto9us>	ro, will be easy to switch between them, just a combined keypress
06:48	<Yorgos>	whoops
06:48	<Frogzoo_away>	bosco: cool
06:48	<Beginer>	When I try to access my Windows partitions while I am using Ubuntu 6.06 Live CD I got error message that I can't access because it is not removeable drive.Why is that?

06:48	<apokryphos>	AskHL: you can go from ubuntu dapper ->	xubuntu by installing xubuntu-desktop
06:48	<xcomputerman>	soundray: well, it went offtopic when I was making a comment about dvd images being available and my language came into question. :)

06:49	<leonel>	DAPPER  ROCKS !!!!

06:49	<to0om>	i use dapper soundray
06:50	<tRSS>	how can I change my sources.list for dapper drake?
06:50	<pike__>	AskHL: when it first boots up type 'server' and hit enter. once the install is done it will drop you at a login prompt; login and type sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
06:50	<mada>	this is a tad on the chaotic side ...
06:50	<soundray>	to0om: was it working before?
06:50	<mada>	i'm out
06:50	<MariusDC>	which program sould i use to open files with .chm extension?
06:50	<anto9us>	ro, you can have a nested login if that would be prettier

06:50	<ro>	anto9us: a nested login? How do I do that?
06:50	<soundray>	to0om: oh, that's strange. Have you done a cold reboot since you upgraded?
06:51	<Big_T>	got an installation problem, please read my post: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1076892#post1076892
06:51	<apokryphos>	Jug: get the alternate cd
06:51	<anto9us>	ro, in fact, vnc may be a solution come to think of it
06:51	<jitu>	i can only send the packet thru my wireless card but i cannot receive it what must be the problem????
06:51	<gr0>	how can i open a .arm file?
06:51	<to0om>	ok neutrinomass
06:51	<revmouse>	when I run update-flashplugin, it says automatic installation failed due to network problems or upstream changes
06:51	<apokryphos>	Jug: download links in /topic ; information about alternate: /msg ubotu alternate
06:51	<to0om>	yes soundray, a few times
06:51	<jdmpike>	h3sp4wn, added ListenAddress 127.0.0.1:22 to ssd_conf and cycled sshd - no joy
06:51	<Jug>	apokryphos: well I already have the desktop cd...no way to use other installer than that default?
06:51	<ketsugi>	Is there an Edgy Eft channel yet? ;D
06:51	<apokryphos>	Jug: that's right

06:51	<apokryphos>	ketsugi: no
06:51	<ketsugi>	Phooey
06:51	<krazykit>	ketsugi: not for awhile yet
06:51	<Stormx2>	Is the method for upgrading to dapper from 5.10 still replacing breezy with dapper in sources.list and dist-upgrading
06:51	<Jug>	pah
06:51	<Jug>	that new installer sucks
06:51	<jdmpike>	h3sp4wn, it is also listening to port 22
06:52	<apokryphos>	Stormx2: yup; /msg ubotu upgrade for more info
06:52	<krazykit>	Stormx2: yes, that's a supported method
06:52	<Jug>	old was much better
06:52	<jlmr>	does anyone knows how to move grub from MBR to root????
06:52	<krazykit>	Jug: than use the alternative installer
06:52	<felipe_>	ola
06:52	<Jug>	well yes I have to download and burn it..
06:52	<apokryphos>	Jug: why?
06:52	<felipe_>	q
06:52	<peter>	hey gurus: question about webmin
06:52	<neutrinomass>	to0om: Thanks a lot :) Please though do watch your e-mail. Developers will almost certainly have to ask various questions without which they can't really beat the problem ...
06:52	<mjmac>	hmm
06:52	<DBO>	jdmpike, are you running iptables?
06:52	<Marsmensch>	i found a device mit lsusb, how can i get more information about the chip and manufacturer
06:52	<Jug>	apokryphos: what why?
06:52	<ro>	Spec: I need to run something which will only run in X in 8bit depth.
06:52	<apokryphos>	Jug: why does it suck?
06:52	<jdmpike>	DBO, no I don't think I am...
06:52	<felipe_>	ola
06:53	<jitu>	ola
06:53	<mjmac>	so do i need the alternate cd to boot into rescue mode?  that seems stupid.

06:53	<apokryphos>	Jug: please compile a bug report, then.
06:53	<DBO>	jdmpike, ok... hrm, perhaps ssh just doesnt allow loopback?
06:53	<soundray>	Marsmensch: one way is to search the web. Note there's a device specific code in the lsusb output.
06:53	<mjmac>	jtd: no rescue mode that i can figure out, for one
06:53	<DBO>	jdmpike, try sshing to your external IP

06:57	<ArthurDentN770>	thanks
06:57	<apokryphos>	bionic: /msg ubotu xubuntu
06:57	<NoUse>	neutrinomass so what does supported mean?
06:57	<jtd>	bionic: Ubuntu using xfce instead of GNOME
06:57	<fatalblu>	bionic: xfce ubuntu
06:57	<jitu>	what is Xubuntu?
06:57	<apokryphos>	NoUse: supported means being in main
06:57	<neutrinomass>	bionic: It's Ubuntu with Xfce as a desktop environment
06:58	<apokryphos>	jitu: /msg ubotu xubuntu
06:58	<NoUse>	apokryphos ah
06:58	<bionic>	ok thanks guys
06:58	<anto9us>	!xubuntu
06:58	<ubotu>	xubuntu is, like, Ubuntu using Xfce instead of Gnome for the desktop. Details here: https://www.xubuntu.org

06:58	<JoeyB2>	!audigy
06:58	<ubotu>	audigy is probably muted by default in Ubuntu. To unmute, type alsamixer and find Audigy Analog/Digital Out. Select it and press M to unmute. Then type sudo alsactl store to save your settings.
06:59	<sindrum>	ok thanks i will look intoi this
06:59	<soundray>	sindrum: you have to add it via System-Preferences-Sessions
06:59	<damo21>	i like it better personally, less memory hogging, just as easy and nice on the eye
06:59	<felipe_>	ola
06:59	<Ace2005>	And X cannot start
06:59	<Katu>	what is xubuntu?
06:59	<DBO>	Ace2005, did you install Xgl at some point?
06:59	<krazykit>	Katu: uses xfce
06:59	<apokryphos>	neutrinomass: not the exact distinction, since butgtracker for universe/multiverse is launchpad too
06:59	<Jowi>	orangehaw: ok, so the framebuffer is not at fault at least. good. last thing is to follow the fixresolution wiki that is really good ( "/msg ubotu resolution" for the link)
06:59	<apokryphos>	Katu: /msg ubotu xubuntu
06:59	<wastrel>	ok why won't my palmsync work?  using gnome-pilot/evolution/usb
06:59	<sindrum>	k
06:59	<fatalblu>	Katu: ubuntu using xfce as opposed to gnome
06:59	<Ace2005>	DBO: yea i did but i never used it
06:59	<anto9us>	Ace2005, not ideal but getting the earlier driver will fix it
06:59	<felipe_>	ola

06:59	<Spec>	I have a favour to ask for the greaterment of Ubuntu - Is anyone located in and/or around San Diego that would be willing to participate in Ubuntu Advocacy at a convention? Admission is free.
07:00	<apokryphos>	neutrinomass: things in MAIN are supported officially
07:00	<neutrinomass>	Hm.. what about "supported" as in "you can pay Canonical to help you out with it" ?
07:00	<felipe_>	ola

07:00	<jtd>	I would try it, but it's kind of a pain in the ass that when you install packages it doesn't make icons for programs in xfce
07:00	<BigMonkey>	A sysadmin friend is trying to get some fiber channel storage to work.  Does dapper (or ubuntu) support fiber channel?
07:00	<damo21>	does xgl work with xubuntu?
07:00	<ompaul>	Spec, better to put that to the sounder mailing list
07:00	<bionic>	hmm.. https://www.xubuntu.org gets me to fridge.ubuntu.org?

07:02	<ketsugi>	No help
07:02	<fuffalo->	I used the free CD feature on the ubuntu site yesterday, will i receive v6, or will i receive v5?

07:03	<mjmac>	ok...  so i've determined that if you escape out of the graphical boot menu it takes you to the plain old text boot: prompt
07:03	<sorush20>	hi is there a ubuntu party going on in uk?
07:03	<mjmac>	however, entering "rescue" or "linux rescue" gives me a 'Could not find kernel image $foo"
07:03	<BigMonkey>	Does dapper (or ubuntu) support fiber channel?
07:04	<soundray>	sorush20: apparently not, unfortunately :(
07:04	<sorush20>	damn..
07:04	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: you're unlikely to get that kind of answer here
07:04	<felipe_>	olaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
07:04	<sorush20>	where can I  get a couple of penguin costumes?
07:04	<BigMonkey>	mjmac: Where should I ask?

07:04	<DBO>	!offtopic
07:04	<ubotu>	Non Ubuntu support related discussions may be carried out in the channel #ubuntu-offtopic. Editor/Language wars are welcome there!
07:04	<soundray>	mjmac: you should be able to see your kernel options if you hit Tab at boot:
07:04	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: it depends on the hardware, and whether or not mainstream linux supports that hardware.
07:04	<sorush20>	DBO: sorry, wrong tab
07:04	<altprsona>	im trying to find why i cant run nvidia-config as per a tut iv been reading, and googles not helping, where do i start?

07:05	<Reaper>	#natal
07:05	<mikedep333>	hey guys, if I add the universe components (to dapper), will it update official ubuntu packages with newer versions from universe?
07:05	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: if 2.6.15 supports the hardware, then Dapper probably does too.  yes, probably outside of here.  mostly newbs here.
07:05	<ompaul>	sorush20, ask in -offtopic or look on the website
07:06	<mikedep333>	I'm worried that it will replace stable packages with less stable ones
07:06	<soundray>	mikedep333: no
07:06	<goteki>	Where can I disable this darn away message after 10 mins or so?
07:06	<nollidj>	what version of ndiswrapper is bundled with dapper?
07:06	<soundray>	!tell mikedep333 about components
07:06	<chrisbudden14>	hey
07:06	<BigMonkey>	mjmac: Pardon my ignorance.  How can I see if 2.6.15 supports the hardware?
07:06	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: you can always just grab the kernel source and look at the docs/config options
07:06	<DBO>	mikedep333, universe is relatively stable and does not afaik replace any normal core packages
07:06	<avarab>	What will I notice once apt-get dist-upgrade -y finishes? I.e. what's new besides newer packages?;)
07:06	<soundray>	!info ndiswrapper dapper
07:06	<Jowi>	BigMonkey: check the hardware support page at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
07:06	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: or ask google.  :)
07:06	<chrisbudden14>	what is the name of the lamp package in dapper?

07:07	<BigMonkey>	Thanks!
07:07	<soundray>	nollidj: ^^
07:07	<anto9us>	mikedep333, that only happens if you add repositories not belongning to the release which universe and multiverse do, you can pin versions if you add other repositories though
07:07	<nollidj>	soundray: thanks
07:07	<jimcooncat>	!lamp
07:07	<nollidj>	hmm
07:07	<mikedep333>	but anyway, thanks for answering my question on the replacements itself

07:07	<visik7>	what's the difference between cd and dvd ?

07:08	<wasabi>	Looking for a resource for CPU governing. I'd like to set a specific process to always preempt all other processes, and reserve 5% of the CPU at all times.  So a rogue process can be killed... etc
07:08	<visik7>	mjmac: which packages ?
07:08	<goteki>	watching a movie and it pops up after 10 minutes
07:08	<eXIstenZ>	I wonder why ff is kinda slow here, I heard there is some IPv6 fix to that

07:08	<PHiSQuaRE>	wooo, burning dapper, off to the ubuntu world
07:08	<lefty_2nd>	np beginer - had that page open trying to work it out myelf :)
07:09	<Viaken>	wasabi, you could renice it?
07:09	<mjmac>	visik7: i dunno.  "a bunch"?  i can't see any reason to get a DVD ISO unless the machine(s) you're installing to are on a really bad (or nonexistent) net connection
07:09	<cth23>	hi
07:09	<TheMadman>	yes beginer
07:09	<anto9us>	wasabi, renice will do that
07:09	<goteki>	anyone knows?
07:09	<Beginer_>	How Madman?
07:09	<wasabi>	I'd actually like to somehow reserve 5% CPU for root somehow, globally.
07:10	<wasabi>	So I can always SSH in, regardless of load.
07:10	<ketsugi>	Grr
07:10	<DbD->	just sudo apt-dist upgrade for upgrade to drake ?
07:10	<Viaken>	Isn't there a way to set the default nice for programs a user starts?
07:10	<DBO>	wasabi, just renice your sshd to a lower value
07:10	<anto9us>	wasabi, I'm sure giving sshd a -20 will acheive the same thing

07:15	<Guest971>	hi, does the install cd will contain both, the desktop and server installations ?

07:15	<sorush20>	where do I get the repositories again since source-o-matic is not working
07:15	<highvoltage>	root has landed!
07:15	<Unenvarjo>	but very nice, apparently the installation detects my integrated wireless card :)
07:15	<Jeeves_>	sorush20: archive.ubuntu.com
07:15	<sweetnjguy29>	Then, on reboot, it recognizes that there is a boot iso in the disk drive...hangs for about 2 minutes...then proceeds to Grub boot menu
07:15	<gnomefreak>	sorush20: http://gnomefreak.pastebin.com/751665
07:15	<Bluesman>	yeah.. he can't run update-manager....

07:17	<DBO>	buzzed, i think its installed by default
07:17	<Jowi>	jjroper: at least you can see if the swap is used alot by issuing the command "free -m" (list in megabytes)
07:17	<DBO>	buzzed, if you have a voip provider its fantastic
07:17	<WakoKnight>	Jeeves_: So the CD I'll get from shipit won't contain the server install cd ?

07:23	<Jowi>	jjroper: absolutely. but if you see that the swap is not used at all then you don't need to add more. that "free -m" should give you enough info to go on. "/msg ubotu memory" for a nice link on memory management
07:23	<kermitX_>	Orion_1: installed system should be the same.
07:23	<tanek>	SurfnKid: sweden, why?
07:23	<SurfnKid>	ah i thought so
07:23	<C_REATIVE_>	Does anyone know how can i fix it ?  mplayer: error while loading shared libraries: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
07:23	<dixie>	hi guys
07:23	<jimcooncat>	I'd like to know if the livecd gui install does LVM, please
07:23	<SurfnKid>	cuz Telia is swedish :P thats why
07:23	<altprsona>	gksudo kate = cannot open display
07:23	<JohnStax>	it works!! I totally rocked my VI skillzz .. after more then 10 years ;)
07:23	<kermitX_>	Orion_1: if you're comfortable with the text installer from breezy, then it really doesn't matter too much. get the one with the fastest download speed ;)
07:23	<JohnStax>	thx all!!
07:23	<tanek>	i just rebooted second time using dapper... and i got kernel panic 6 times in a row
07:23	<frenkel>	jimcooncat: search next time, it doesn't support LVM
07:23	<tanek>	during hardware driver step
07:24	<jimcooncat>	frenkel, thank you
07:24	<dixie>	is possible to upgrade from previous release of ubuntu by apt-get dist-upgrade ?
07:24	<tanek>	very wiernd and annoying
07:24	<Krpano>	i cant find the msttcorefonts with synaptic....i have all the sources enabled tho.... :(
07:24	<lastnode>	dixie, of course
07:24	<GianLuigiBuffon>	dixie yes
07:24	<GianLuigiBuffon>	dixie I did
07:24	<SurfnKid>	Krpano :S
07:24	<dixie>	super, i will try it :)
07:24	<kermitX_>	krpano: did you update the package list after enabling the extra repos?
07:24	<zjohnson>	if you are already using ubuntu 6.06 beta will you just automatically update to ubuntu 6.06 non-beta or are they any special commands to run besides apt-get update && apt-get upgrade??
07:24	<Sweet_kate>	hey guys can i gently suggest me a shoutcast radio winamp-like player?
07:24	<lastnode>	Krpano, http://packages.ubuntu.com/ is a good place to searc
07:24	<lastnode>	zjohnson, apt-get dist-upgrade is good
07:25	<GianLuigiBuffon>	lastnode... you know why flash and other stuff is working wrong when I've upgraded to dapper from breezy?
07:25	<SurfnKid>	Im not messing with my 5.10 setup
07:25	<Amaranth>	Sweet_kate: winamp-like? that'd be xmms
07:25	<SurfnKid>	took me long enough to get here I'll just leave it alone
07:25	<Orion_1>	i want the best way
07:25	<lastnode>	GianLuigiBuffon, there can be a few problems. try reinstalling?
07:25	<Krpano>	kermitX_ , yep ...
07:25	<Orion_1>	i am hesitating all day.. livecd or test installer ..
07:25	<Krpano>	lastnode , ill check it
07:25	<Orion_1>	uff
07:25	<r0xoR>	Sweet_kate, xmms is a trusty one for me
07:25	<GianLuigiBuffon>	lastnode, you mean to download the whole dapper, and formatting?
07:25	<r0xoR>	Sweet_kate, i've tried others but so far nothing has beat xmms yet
07:25	<Orion_1>	they said livecd had a problem
07:25	<r0xoR>	Sweet_kate, at least for me
07:25	<lastnode>	GianLuigiBuffon, er?
07:25	<kermitX_>	krpano: can you just use terminal? sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
07:25	<SurfnKid>	xmms is nice Sweet_kate
07:26	<Amaranth>	Orion_1: livecd is the new installer (could have bugs, mostly works right)
07:26	<ketsugi>	This is weird
07:26	<ketsugi>	Can anyone try to ping this address: http://dirt-.blogspot.com/
07:26	<GianLuigiBuffon>	lastnote yeah... now I have dapper because i've upgraded from breezy... but just with apt... so how a "reinstall"
07:26	<Amaranth>	Orion_1: or did you mean tested?
07:26	<PHiSQuaRE>	the livecd is really really nice
07:26	<ketsugi>	I know there's a site there, but for some reason Firefox keeps giving me a 404
07:26	<MrKeuner>	hi, I have inserted alternate cd and, package manager has opened and I did an mark all upgrades && apply. is this all I have to do for an breezy2dapper upgrade?
07:26	<Amaranth>	ketsugi: remove the -
07:27	<ketsugi>	yes, but then I get the wrong site.
07:27	<jrk29>	Hi
07:27	<kermitX_>	ketsugi try http://dirt.blogspot.com/
07:27	<zeelot>	hello guys, i encountered a problem setting up my wireless, and here is the situation: i was a breezy user and my d-link DWL-650+ wireless card worked just fine, after i reinstall Dapper, somehow it doesn't connect to AP anymore, i can see clearly the driver's been loaded from lshw and lspci but it just can't work, i setup iwconfig also, is there anyone have any idea what might cause this to happend? thanks
07:27	<zjohnson>	ok, I am performing apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && apt-get dist-upgrade
07:27	<Bugs>	ketsugi: unknown host
07:27	<Amaranth>	ketsugi: and please don't post sites like that in this channel
07:27	<lastnode>	zjohnson, good man :)
07:27	<Orion_1>	i will try the text mode
07:27	<Krpano>	kermitX_ ....it wont work neither.
07:27	<jrk29>	Did multimedia codecs by mplayer, installed in /usr/lib/win32, stop working in xine with dapper? :-?
07:27	<Orion_1>	seems easier
07:27	<ketsugi>	Ubuntu doesn't seem to like the dash in the URL
07:27	<ketsugi>	but it's a valid URL
07:27	<Amaranth>	zeelot: any obvious error messages in dmesg?
07:27	<ketsugi>	and there's a site there which I can't get to :/
07:27	<dmesg>	hi
07:27	<NoUse>	zjohnson you only need to use dist-upgrade, upgrade and dist-upgrade is redundant
07:27	<Avian00>	can somebody tell me if the dapper repositories are down?
07:27	<Bugs>	ketsugi:  yes, remove the hypen and it works
07:27	<r0xoR>	hahahah, powered by blogger
07:27	<anto9us>	zeelot, does 'sudo iwlist scanning' show the ap?
07:27	<ketsugi>	Bugs: but it's the wrong site
07:27	<dmesg>	how can i become a ubuntu certificade?
07:27	<SurfnKid>	can ubuntu defrag?
07:28	<ketsugi>	that's someone else's blog
07:28	<kermitX_>	krpano: double check /etc/apt/sources.list and ensure the extra repos are enabled.
07:28	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, ext2 and 3 don't need defragging
07:28	<lastnode>	SurfnKid, fsck?
07:28	<ketsugi>	dirt. and dirt-. are different sites
07:28	<CHodapp>	Ok, here's a common question. How are desktop, server, and alternate different?
07:28	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, the need for defrag is a sign of a badly written filesystem
07:28	<Bugs>	ketsugi:  try this:::: ping dirt.blogspot.com
07:28	<r0xoR>	i.e. fat32 or hfs
07:28	<CHodapp>	r0xoR, that's what I tell people, but they keep on using those FSes...
07:28	<zeelot>	Amaranth: no error msg
07:28	<ketsugi>	Yeah, if I do that I just get the blogspot IP
07:28	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  does ubuntu have a heartbeat like NT? I just want my hard drive to last
07:28	<ketsugi>	if I try to ping dirt-. I get unknown host
07:28	<Amaranth>	Bugs: that site works but he is saying the site with a - really exists
07:28	<zeelot>	anto9us: no, no ap scanned
07:28	<lastnode>	CHodapp, point them to the download page, it's clearly defined
07:28	<Avian00>	keep getting "403 Forbidden [IP 85.133.25.8 80] " error when using apt or synaptic
07:29	<jrk29>	SurfnKid: heartbeat?
07:29	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, stop thinking about NT my friend :)
07:29	<dmesg>	i want to be a ubuntu ceetificate
07:29	<Avian00>	are repositories down?
07:29	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, i don't think you even know what you're talkin about :)
07:29	<lmortiz>	hola
07:29	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, ubuntu is NOT going to "wear out your hard drive" faster than windows
07:29	<dmesg>	hola
07:29	<r0xoR>	!es
07:29	<ubotu>	Para Espaol por favor usen #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, alli obtendran mas ayuda.
07:29	<Krpano>	kermitX_ , done, now it works......thx.. :D
07:29	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  the hard drive has a heartbeat on NT, just wondering if ubuntu runs on that principle,
07:29	<whiter>	doesnt ubuntu access the hard drive less than windows?
07:29	<CHodapp>	"heartbeat"?
07:30	<whiter>	because of the way it uses memory
07:30	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  I am no more NT on this box at least
07:30	<Bugs>	ketsugi:  no, it does not seem to exist.  Only the dirt.blogspot comes up in my browser
07:30	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, yeah so stop thinking about it :)
07:30	<defunkt>	whiter: it access it differently
07:30	<SurfnKid>	lol
07:30	<whiter>	yes i know that
07:30	<whiter>	but less right
07:30	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, i've been using linux for 7 years and programming for 12 and I ain't never come across a "heartbeat" for a harddrive
07:30	<kspath>	!FUD
07:30	<ubotu>	fud is, like, [FUD]  Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. A marketing technique employed by those who do not trust in the merits of their own product. Also Fair Use Day.
07:30	<SurfnKid>	just hate to defrag and ugh its nasty
07:30	<ketsugi>	Bugs: that's the problem... Windows can handle that URL
07:30	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, sucker ain't alive ya know
07:30	<ketsugi>	I'm trying to figure out why Ubuntu doesn't want to (or Debian, I guess)
07:30	<SurfnKid>	ok
07:30	<CHodapp>	I have 2.4 GB drives that have been taking a daily beating for 8 years and not died
07:31	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, hello! i already toldya... you don't need to defrag in ubuntu... that alone should save your hard drive some wear and tear
07:31	<Bugs>	ketsugi: Oh...well maybe windows resolves that URL into a proper URL ?
07:31	<CHodapp>	Usually if drives are about to die, you can hear the bearings going out
07:31	<sorush20>	I'm unable to upgrade since I keep getting the message that there was an error downloading the packages.. I'm using adept and kde and using safe upgrade..
07:31	<defunkt>	whiter: in terms of system processes?
07:31	<r0xoR>	CHodapp, scsi?
07:31	<ketsugi>	Can't be
07:31	<jjroper>	Jowi, my swap is unused, but my memory is maxed out...and unfortunately, I am not sure what "/msg ubotu memory" means....
07:31	<ketsugi>	all the *.blogspot.com URLs map to the same IP address
07:31	<CHodapp>	r0xoR, IDE drives on the way to the dumpster if I didn't take them
07:31	<zeelot>	i followed every steps listed on the ubuntu wiki, troubleshooting,but every information shows that my wireless card is configured and driver's been loaded, just can't scan my AP....
07:31	<jrk29>	jjroper: just type "/msg ubotu memory"
07:31	<lmortiz>	hola estais vivos alguien
07:31	<ketsugi>	Ubuntu just chokes on the dash and thinks it's invalid
07:31	<ketsugi>	oh well
07:31	<Amaranth>	SurfnKid: no defrag needed, the ext3 filesystem is smarter about positioning files on the drive
07:31	<ketsugi>	I'll post in the forums
07:31	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  sweet, so can I turn off my hard drive after like 5 minutes...
07:31	<thoreauputic>	Quick visit... swarm speed on torrent currently 5.7MB/s - I'm uploading at 90KB/sec and now I'm going to bed :)
07:32	<Avian00>	Anybody at all, I am the only one having trouble with the repositories?
07:32	<CHodapp>	Has there been any Linux filesystem that needed defragging? Even ext1?
07:32	<Amaranth>	thoreauputic: whoa
07:32	<kspath>	lmortiz: #ubuntu is english
07:32	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, uhhh, yeah you can use power saver mode just like any other computer :)
07:32	<thoreauputic>	Amaranth: :))
07:32	<anto9us>	zeelot, iwconfig lists your device but without an inet address?
07:32	<SurfnKid>	Amaranth, right r0xoR  keeps saying that so thats cool
07:32	<tRSS>	i would like to apt-get dapper, but I just can't find what changes I need to make in my sources.list to achieve this. wiki tells me that i need to access this site: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666, but this site is not working. I would appreciate some help here.
07:32	<Greyscale>	Right
07:32	<zeelot>	anto9us:yes you got it
07:32	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  thats what i was wondering, in NT that was impossible cuz of the stupid HB
07:32	<AskHL>	jjroper, /msg sends a message. ubotu is the channel bot, which has a number of standard help commands. It'll probably send you a link where you can read the desired information
07:32	<mike-e>	!easysource
07:32	<anto9us>	zeelot, ifconfig I mean
07:32	<ubotu>	For an easy to use custom sources.list creator, visit http://ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
07:32	<wastrel>	don't be sad
07:32	<r0xoR>	tRSS, please read the channel topic
07:32	<GianLuigiBuffon>	I have dapper installed.... upgraded from breezy.... downloading the desktop CD will fix the problems? or will better to re-install all?
07:32	<Bugs>	ifconfig /all
07:32	<zeelot>	anto9us: yes if config
07:32	<Greyscale>	Some one point me to a guide to using ndiswrapper on 6.06 please?
07:33	<h3h_timo>	i just updated!!! yes... but last time when i upgraded to the rc... after i restarted my ethernet was all messed up.. im afraid to reboot now lol
07:33	<Amaranth>	tRSS: basically everywhere your current sources.list says breezy you change that to say dapper instead
07:33	<SurfnKid>	tacowrapperNDIS my friends
07:33	<thoreauputic>	Oh that swarm figure is for the desktop CD by the way
07:33	<SurfnKid>	=D
07:33	<willmc>	ahhh what a lovely release of Ubuntu everyone! lets say thank you in this chat room to show our appreciation to all the hard work that has gone in to making this wonderful release :)
07:33	<CHodapp>	tacowrapperNDIS?
07:33	<tRSS>	thanks alot Amarnath! much appreicated!
07:33	<SurfnKid>	CHodapp, I had one of those this morning, it was good
07:33	<Greyscale>	I like taco's
07:33	<MrObvious>	Does 6.06 support writing to NTFS safely?
07:33	<spikeh>	good evening; Xserver is giving me an error because my graphics card is not supported
07:33	<SurfnKid>	hehe
07:33	<lastnode>	willmc, totally!
07:33	<Amaranth>	MrObvious: not without captiventfs
07:33	<MrObvious>	Or is it read only?
07:33	<SurfnKid>	MrObvious, no idea
07:33	<r0xoR>	spikeh, what kind of graphics card
07:33	<CHodapp>	I have a DWL-G510 that I use with Atheros . . . guess I'll find out if Ubuntu likes to read it
07:34	<zeelot>	auto9us: people from my country's community told me that sort hardware will encounter this kind of problem, that after upgraded from breezy to Dapper some hardware will malfunctioned
07:34	<CHodapp>	I'm used to setting up by hand anyhow
07:34	<spikeh>	ATI X850
07:34	<MrObvious>	Amaranth: Is that safe and can I apt-get it?
07:34	<rob_>	Hello there, I downloaded the linux package from the nvidia website. And i'm told to "Type "sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8762-pkg1.run" to install the driver. " http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-8762.html
07:34	<spikeh>	r0xoR: last time with kubuntu, it would give me prompt
07:34	<r0xoR>	MrObvious, that's a kernel issue and i doubt it
07:34	<anto9us>	zeelot, sorry to go through the obvious buy you've checked the wireless isn't disabled on your system?
07:34	<spikeh>	but this time, it doesn't
07:34	<Amaranth>	MrObvious: It's mostly safe and no, you can't apt-get it.
07:34	<r0xoR>	MrObvious, you'll probably either have to install a module or compile the kernel yourself with NTFS write support
07:34	<funman>	hi
07:34	<MrObvious>	Ok just asking :)
07:34	<KhZillu>	anyone have troubles with ndiswrapper and broadcom wifi? because I am.
07:34	<MrObvious>	I'll create a FAT partition then
07:34	<spikeh>	so I am not sure how I can configure my network adapter and download the ati xorgconf
07:34	<r0xoR>	spikeh, please answer the question... what kind of graphics card
07:34	<KhZillu>	with dapper that is
07:34	<spikeh>	ATI X850
07:34	<SurfnKid>	KhZillu, what kind of problem
07:34	<spikeh>	I have answered the question :)
07:34	<Double_D>	!upgrade
07:34	<ubotu>	upgrade is, like, Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
07:35	<Amaranth>	r0xoR: Captive uses FUSE, no kernel recompile needed. Just a download and install script.
07:35	<Greyscale>	Some one point me to a guide to using ndiswrapper on 6.06 please?
07:35	<zeelot>	anto9us: it's not disabled, lshw show it's on, i can ifupdown it and i can iwconfig it just nothing happend after configuring
07:35	<h3sp4wn>	KhZillu: Either install the correct firmware or blacklist brm43xx
07:35	<mwe>	what package provides gnome-window-decorator? apt-file can't find it :|
07:35	<DBO>	compiz-gnome
07:35	<KhZillu>	ah yes
07:35	<reoffendr>	anyone else having the installer hang while partitioning?
07:35	<mwe>	oh
07:35	<h3sp4wn>	KhZillu: You want to use the native driver if you can
07:35	<KhZillu>	blacklist bcm43xx
07:35	<Viaken>	Dapper in one line: sudo sed -i.bak -e 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
07:35	<Greyscale>	Some one point me to a guide to using ndiswrapper on 6.06 please?
07:35	<Amaranth>	mwe: please join #ubuntu-xgl for xgl/compiz problems
07:35	<anto9us>	zeelot, ok, the AP may have it's essid hidden and may not be issuing more leases, check its config
07:35	<rob_>	So my question is, where do I type this? Do I bring up a console? And how do I bring one up?
07:36	<KhZillu>	are they running native now without ndiswrapper?
07:36	<Greyscale>	Some one point me to a guide to using ndiswrapper on 6.06 please?
07:36	<iNiku>	is it just me or are the ubuntu sites totally swamped?
07:36	<wastrel>	rob_:  alt-f2 then type xterm
07:36	<Greyscale>	What are running native?
07:36	<SurfnKid>	!ndiswrapper
07:36	<ubotu>	ndiswrapper is probably a way to support Windows wireless drivers, but it is buggy compared to native support. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
07:36	<spikeh>	can someone please tell me how to get terminal up after xserver crashes
=== lars-ut is now known as lars-ut-away
07:36	<SurfnKid>	Greyscale, not sure if that'll help or if its for the 6.06 but its worth a look
07:36	<h3sp4wn>	KhZillu: Yes but you need to install the firmware (using fwcutter) see the brc43xx page on the wiki
07:36	<Amaranth>	spikeh: ctrl-alt-f1
07:36	<zeelot>	anto9us: it's kinda impossible cuz my AP's Essid is at all time broadcasting....
07:36	<Avian00>	I guess I figured in a channel full of Ubuntu users that I might be able to find out if I was the only one experiencing trouble getting Dapper updates via the apt repositories
07:36	<iNiku>	anybody have pointers to the kubuntu desktop and alternative cd torrents?
07:37	<Greyscale>	Yay!
07:37	<JPatch>	anyone dealing with isolinux Disk error 05? (it's a start...)
07:37	<r0xoR>	spikeh, oh wow sorry, i totally missed that :)
07:37	<spikeb>	iNiku, sure, give me a sec
07:37	<Viaken>	bah...
07:37	<Viaken>	Correction.
07:37	<Viaken>	Dapper in one line: sudo sed -i.bak -e 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
07:37	<JyZky>	Can someone help me with installing ubuntu?
07:37	<mjmac>	aaaugh.  stupid busybox mount doesn't handle bind mounts
07:37	<reoffendr>	nobody has any thoughts on installer hanging during partitioning? SATA, ext3
07:37	<DBO>	Viaken, "gksudo update-manager -d" does the same thing
07:37	<r0xoR>	spikeh, Amaranth i've never heard of Captive or FUSE
07:37	<NoUse>	JyZky what kind of problem are you having?
07:37	<Bugs>	!POLL - What is your favorite CHAT client ?
07:37	<ubotu>	Bugs: okay
07:37	<anto9us>	zeelot, does AP show any wireless activity?
07:37	<r0xoR>	JyZky, uhhh, please just ask us a specific question
07:37	<NoUse>	!tell Bugs about offtopic
07:37	<spikeb>	Bugs, xchat

07:38	<Amaranth>	!fuse
07:38	<ubotu>	You can read about Ubuntu NTFS writing here (It still is not safe) https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lkraider/NtfsFuse
07:38	<mjmac>	h3sp4wn: i need /proc in the chroot

07:40	<NoUse>	JyZky did you read the verify link ubotu posted?
07:40	<Amaranth>	[zero] : it might be called 'vfat' in gparted
07:40	<zeelot>	anto9us: okey i try this first
07:40	<luis_>	which video driver is recommended for XGL? the ATI one, or the fglrx one?

07:41	<ifxx>	hey @all ... has anyone set up the sgi performer under ubuntu??
07:41	<Amaranth>	[zero] : how are you trying to mount it?

07:41	<gnomefreak>	h3h_timo: make sure its enabled in the networking menu
07:41	<SurfnKid>	mmm let me see
07:41	<mjmac>	apparently the dapper kernel setup didn't run lilo after installing the new kernel
07:41	<spikeh>	SurfnKid it is a wireless router but my PC is connected via wire to it
07:41	<JyZky>	nouse i get to the splash screen then press install or start ubuntu
07:42	<JyZky>	nouse then it loads kernel 100%
07:42	<gnomefreak>	h3h_timo: what makes you think its not gonna work?
07:42	<mada>	mjmac: that'll do it
07:42	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, it should be
07:42	<mjmac>	that was more work than it should have been.  :/
07:42	<[zero] >	Amaranth:  when I click to open it it comes up with "Unable to mount the selected volume."
07:42	<mada>	:(
07:42	<SurfnKid>	spikeh, let me look up a command really quick
07:42	<JPatch>	my desktop will not "mount root drive"
07:42	<JyZky>	nouse then its some root files and system they go OK
07:42	<NoUse>	JyZky back up, you need to verify that the ISO you download was downloaded properly
07:42	<Anusien>	oh man, dapper is [O] fficial now, right?
07:42	<spikeh>	thank you SurfnKid
07:42	<Amaranth>	[zero] : ok, let me get a link to the wiki page for this
07:42	<apokryphos>	Anusien: yes
07:42	<spikeh>	one last question: can someone quickly tell me the command to get the fglrx driver
07:42	<mada>	JPatch: like, just flat out won't mount the root volume?
07:42	<spikeh>	the website is very slow
07:42	<SurfnKid>	gnomefreak, see im helping people out, i just meant he sucked cuz he was hauling butt =D and im not :P
07:42	<[zero] >	Amaranth: thankx :D

07:44	<Amaranth>	[zero] : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
07:44	<apokryphos>	MrKeuner: no, you have to mark the CD as a source

07:46	<tristanmike>	h4ch3r, don't need to be sorry for being mistaken, I was just letting you know, that's all
07:46	<SurfnKid>	spikeh, not sure if this command would work too "ifconfig eth0 -dynamic"  as in dynamic ip but its worth a try
07:46	<DBO>	spikeh, then yes, that is the command
07:46	<h4ch3r>	tristanmike: download edgy efl?

07:52	<PHiSQuaRE>	Amaranth, I'm just mainly looking for package management help and what not
07:52	<hazart>	DBO: Ok, thanks. :)
07:52	<mada>	r0xoR: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=142727 (the svn repository mentioned in the tutorial has been down for a couple months, so on page 5 of the topic someone posted the file you need and it works (its the one i used))
07:52	<iNiku>	oh :)
07:52	<h4ch3r>	i see guys
07:52	<gnomefreak>	hazart: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
07:52	<Viaken>	hazart: There's no harm in doing so anyway.
07:52	<r0xoR>	mada, ok grea thanks a lot :) ... cheers
07:52	<gnomefreak>	or upgrade
07:52	<NoUse>	JyZky compare that to the md5sum file from the mirror
07:52	<Amaranth>	PHiSQuaRE: synaptic usually handles that
07:52	<mada>	r0xoR: very welcome ... enjoy
07:52	<Jimmey__>	"Since Ubuntu doesn't run any daemons that listen to the outside world by default (the postfix install only listens on localhost) there's no need for a default firewall.". Is there one anyway?
07:52	<JyZky>	nouse it was right
07:52	<thug>	did anyone installed dapper yet ?
07:52	<nnacht>	Hello, how can I get totem to play divx-movies?
07:52	<h4ch3r>	upgrade gnome 2.14.1 in dapper for gnome 2.15.2?
07:52	<hazart>	gnomefreak: Viaken: Okay, i'll go with dist-upgrade then.
07:53	<thug>	the official release ...
07:53	<mada>	r0xoR: i will warn that the driver is still in beta, so your wifi range isn't incredible but it does work
07:53	<tristanmike>	!tell nnacht about w32codecs
07:53	<gnomefreak>	hazart: just leave the sources.list file alone and you will be fine
07:53	<thug>	?
07:53	<r0xoR>	mada, hmmm... by not incredible... will it reach the next room at least?
07:53	<mada>	thug: neg, RC a few days ago
07:53	<gnomefreak>	thug: yes they have
07:53	<tristanmike>	nnacht, you also probably need to install the totem-xine backend as well
07:53	<pally>	!tell pally about w32codecs
07:53	<nnacht>	tristanmike: I have already installed w32codes
07:53	<AngryElf1>	guys, I'm trying to setup ivtv which uses the hotplug system......none of the directories where the firmware is suppose ot be exists.......also, /etc/firmware.agent doesn't exist -- is there a packaeg i'm missing?
07:53	<thug>	gnomefreak and how is it like ? a lot faster then the previous one ?
07:53	<hazart>	gnomefreak: yes, it's almost too easy :D - gotta' love it
07:53	<tristanmike>	pally, use "/msg ubotu <factiod>" for privite encounters
07:53	<nnacht>	totem-xine is also installed
07:54	<h4ch3r>	upgrade gnome 2.14.1 for gnome 2.15.2 in the dapper draker?
07:54	<JyZky>	nouse HEY WTF
07:54	<samu>	I still can't update by pressing check
07:54	<gnomefreak>	thug: its the same as dapper has been
07:54	<thug>	gnomefreak or most same just packages upgraded ?
07:54	<JPatch>	mada: seems you have your hands full... any ideas on your end at least?
07:54	<pally>	<tristanmike>	ok
07:54	<nnacht>	libdivx4linux is also installed
07:54	<Adullix>	slm arkada015flar
07:54	<JyZky>	nouse some mirrors got diffrent md5 than others
07:54	<h4ch3r>	helooo
07:54	<JyZky>	nouse whats the right one
07:54	<thug>	gnomefreak yeah very funny
07:54	<Amaranth>	nnacht: What errors are you getting?
07:54	<gnomefreak>	thug: dapper stable is the same as dapper rc
07:54	<nanotube>	nnacht, try installing mplayer to play things. totem ain't that great at playing various codecs :)
07:54	<mada>	r0xoR: oh yeah, i am just talking about on the outter limits of the wifi range it won't reach (i lost connection on campus where OS X would give me a very slow one) ... not too big of a deal and i think in the 2.6.17 kernel that issue is being fixed
07:54	<hazart>	How do i configure automatic updates on a server not running the update-daemon?
07:54	<gnomefreak>	thug: im not kiddin
07:54	<Adullix>	trke bilen kimse yokmu
07:54	<Amaranth>	nnacht: Can gxine play the files?
07:54	<hazart>	automatic security updates that is.
07:54	<tristanmike>	nnacht, what nanotube said, also you might want to try VLC as well
07:55	<thug>	gnomefreak is it better then the previous one ? breezy ?
07:55	<h4ch3r>	upgrade gnome 2.14.2 for gnome 2.15.2 in dapper???
07:55	<r0xoR>	mada, huh... yeah i always upgrade straight my own custom compiled kernel 90% of the time
07:55	<h4ch3r>	somewhere?
07:55	<neighborlee>	does anyone know approximately when ubuntu will have fulll LSB compliance ? ;-))
07:55	<nnacht>	vlc plays well, but I need totem to load subtiles
07:55	<h4ch3r>	some
07:55	<h4ch3r>	?
07:55	<gnomefreak>	thug: i think it is but thats for you to decide
07:55	<Adullix>	slm arkada015flar
07:55	<r0xoR>	mada, i don't like being stuck with the distro kernel :)
07:55	<mada>	JPatch: i did a little looking into isolinux errors and most of them come from cd-rom drives and BIOS having issues with linux .... not so much with hdds, but i am still trying to find something
07:55	<nanotube>	nnacht, hmm, mplayer does well with subtitles, generally
07:55	<Adullix>	trke konu015fan kimse yokmu
07:55	<mcphail>	hazart: run a cron job
07:55	<JyZky>	Nouse some mirrors got diffrent md5 than others? what is right
07:55	<h4ch3r>	!upgrade gnome 2.14.2 for gnome 2.15.2 in dapper?
=== ubuntu is now known as william_c
07:55	<ubotu>	h4ch3r: Some people juggle geese. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
07:55	<r0xoR>	Adullix, english please
07:55	<JoeyB2>	!lamp
07:56	<thug>	gnomefreak ok i will freak out too with it on gnome desktop ... i might gonna be a gnomefreak like you after :)
07:56	<lucasvo>	http://pastebin.com/751756
07:56	<JPatch>	mada: so it would be a good idea to swap a new cd-drive into this thign?
07:56	<gnomefreak>	h4ch3r: gnome 2.14 is in dapper
07:56	<PHiSQuaRE>	The ubuntu startup screen is way too cool
07:56	<h4ch3r>	gnomefreak:
07:56	<buzzed>	so what's the verdict on Dapper? Yeah or Neah
07:56	<hazart>	mcphail: with what command, how can i specyfy that i only want updates from a specific repos? apt-get update && apt-get upgrade dapper-security or something like that?
07:56	<JoeyB2>	!apache
07:56	<ubotu>	apache is probably https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ApacheMySQLPHP
07:56	<JyZky>	NoUse?
07:56	<mada>	r0xoR: yeah, the 2.6.17-RC2 has built in Airport Extreme support and it is getting better as the days go on, but with the standard dapper kernel, the thing on the forum makes it work like a godsend
07:56	<h4ch3r>	i upgrade 2.14 for 2.15 in dapper
07:56	<h4ch3r>	?
07:56	<lucasvo>	I have problem with a tetex package, I can't download it (http://pastebin.com/751756)
07:56	<JyZky>	NoUse some got diffrent md5 than others
07:56	<KhZillu>	upgradding to dapper from breezy uninstalled open office
07:56	<mada>	JPatch: if you have it at your disposal, it might be worth a shot
07:56	<gnomefreak>	h4ch3r: no
07:56	<KhZillu>	weird
07:56	<hazart>	h4ch3r: you can't 2.15 will first come in edgy.
07:56	<r0xoR>	mada, ok well then i'll probably just go the easy route to start off
07:57	<h4ch3r>	hazart: no
07:57	<h4ch3r>	is 2.16
07:57	<JyZky>	ffs
07:57	<h4ch3r>	edgy
07:57	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: why would you want to use 2.15? there isn't really anything new in it yet and it's the development version
07:57	<JyZky>	ubotu ur bot?
07:57	<gnomefreak>	h4ch3r: thats what he said
07:57	<mada>	r0xoR: i agree, i don't know how stable 2.6.17 is at the moment
07:57	<ubotu>	My cat's name is Mittens! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, JyZky
07:57	<h4ch3r>	and?
07:57	<DavidJaq>	I'm having a horrible time getting Ubuntu to work on my computer... no matter what I tried I couldn't get my old computer to boot from CD, so I had to take out the hard drive and put it into my other computer, install Dapper Drake, and then put the drive back in my old computer
07:57	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: while edgy is in development it will have 2.15
07:57	<gnomefreak>	Amaranth: thats if it is build with the dapper libs
07:57	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: because 2.15 becomes 2.16 when it's stable
07:57	<mcphail>	hazart: the finer point of apt-get are lost on me. You could script a hack to replace /etc/apt/sources.list temporarily with the repos you want to use
07:57	<h4ch3r>	Amaranth:
07:57	<jlmr>	grub, and the find /boot/grub/stage1 tells me it is installed in hd0,4 but i think it is in MBR, or am not getting anything?
07:57	<PHiSQuaRE>	jesus, the ubuntu installer is FAR better than the FC5 installer, I have to say I'm quite impressed so far....
07:57	<hazart>	h4ch3r: yes, but you can select the edgy sources before it's stable, and get it that way.
07:57	<JPatch>	mada: alright, I'm gonna try that.  thanks for your help sir/madam!
07:57	<h4ch3r>	i use
07:57	<JPatch>	:)
07:57	<h4ch3r>	dapper
07:57	<MetaMorfoziS>	anybody can tellme a stopper program?
07:57	<MetaMorfoziS>	stopwatch
07:58	<DavidJaq>	but now ubuntu won't load up, it says 'mounting root' or something like that, then 'waiting on root' or something similar, then hangs and eventually drops to busybox
07:58	<JyZky>	ffs
07:58	<paulproteus>	MetaMorfoziS, I usually use kteatimer.
07:58	<paulproteus>	kteatime, rather.
07:58	<gnomefreak>	h4ch3r: you cant not get gnome 2.15 on dapper
07:58	<KhZillu>	anyone know what this means? #1 SMP PREEMPT
07:58	<mcphail>	hazart: _but_ aren't all the updates on the stable branch from security???
07:58	<MetaMorfoziS>	thx
07:58	<sally_>	is there a version of automatix that works with dapper?
07:58	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: ok then, wait a couple weeks and if you still want 2.15 switch to the edgy development versions
07:58	<[zero] >	Amaranth: Im a bit confused by the wiki link :/
07:58	<Amaranth>	sally_: probably not, but easyubuntu works with dapper
07:58	<mada>	JPatch: it's a sir ... name's Adam ... just reversed it ;) and you are very welcome, anytime :)
07:58	<KhZillu>	Linux cow 2.6.15-23-686 #1 SMP PREEMPT
07:58	<bbrazil>	KhZillu: first build from that tree, multi-processor, preemptive scheduling
07:58	<jeroen__>	hi
07:58	<gnomefreak>	sally_: dont use it
07:58	<gnomefreak>	!automatix
07:58	<ubotu>	[automatix]  unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
07:58	<h4ch3r>	gnomefreak: ?
07:58	<sally_>	gnomefreak: why not
07:58	<hazart>	mcphail: I suppose, i guess i will just disable backports, multiverse and universe then.
07:58	<h4ch3r>	yes man
07:58	<r0xoR>	mada, how fast is your ibook?
07:58	<KhZillu>	even though it's not a SMP kernel?
07:58	<h4ch3r>	help me
07:59	<gnomefreak>	sally_: read above
07:59	<r0xoR>	mada, and how fast does ubuntu run on it?
07:59	<mada>	r0xoR: 1GHz G4
07:59	<JyZky>	nice help......
07:59	<jeroen__>	does anyone know what to do with this error (happens when i try to run glxinfo or compiz with Xgl (nvidia drivers)):

07:59	<gnomefreak>	h4ch3r: with what? gnome 2.15 will not run on dapper
07:59	<bbrazil>	KhZillu: that is an SMP kernel
07:59	<boxemall>	got a strange problem
07:59	<r0xoR>	mada, sweet, i figured
07:59	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: If you want help on getting gnome 2.15 running on dapper you don't know enough to be using 2.15
07:59	<h4ch3r>	why
07:59	<jeroen__>	X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
07:59	<jeroen__>	  Major opcode of failed request:  148 (GLX)

07:59	<mcphail>	hazart: you could try braving ##debian....
07:59	<r0xoR>	mada, lol... honestly OS X really didn't do it for me...
07:59	<KhZillu>	running just the regular 2.6.15-23-686
07:59	<gnomefreak>	h4ch3r: it wasnt build for dapper
07:59	<scifi>	so here goes guys, what the sudo apt-get command to install dapper ?
07:59	<gnomefreak>	jeroen__: dont paste please
07:59	<saif>	the sound i am getting from skype is all fuzzy and not understandable, did any1 here get it to work?
07:59	<hazart>	mcphail: yes, thank's for your help.
07:59	<boxemall>	i already searched the whole weg including the ubuntu forums and every wii page i could find
07:59	<mada>	r0xoR: yeah, Ubuntu runs noticably faster on it
07:59	<r0xoR>	mada, i like linux cuz of the variety of window managers... i can always set something up the way i like it perfectly
08:00	<h4ch3r>	?
08:00	<h4ch3r>	why?
08:00	<h4ch3r>	why?
08:00	<DavidJaq>	anyone know what I can do to get my computer to run Dapper Drake if it won't boot from CD and crashes me to BusyBox when trying to boot Dapper that I installed by transplanting my hard drive in a better computer temporarily?
08:00	<gnomefreak>	Amaranth: i think im starting to look at h4ch3r as a troll
08:00	<r0xoR>	mada, sweet
08:00	<boxemall>	i got no sound at all
08:00	<KhZillu>	even the plain 686 has smp?
08:00	<r0xoR>	mada, well that's good news then :)
08:00	<Amaranth>	gnomefreak: me too
08:00	<boxemall>	finally i manged it to get sound under ubuntu
08:00	<JyZky>	amaranth
08:00	<gnomefreak>	you got it?
08:00	<r0xoR>	heheheh
08:00	<madmike>	dapper is release, the # is boiling :D
08:00	<gnomefreak>	ok
08:00	<mada>	r0xoR: agreed, i also like linux because i am a computer science major and its so nice for developing software on
08:00	<boxemall>	but now it is like a looped sound
08:00	<Amaranth>	gnomefreak: already handled :)
08:00	<[zero] >	what does this mean?

08:00	<dxdemetriou>	Is it better to make an upgrade from Breezy to Dapper from CD or with the Update Manager?
08:00	<gnomefreak>	i saw ;)
08:00	<gnomefreak>	i got lag
08:00	<JyZky>	Amaranth what is the right md5 for the ubuntu x86 desktop? cause some mirrors got other md5s than others
08:00	<boxemall>	this starts right away at login screen

08:00	<scifi>	is it sudo apt-get update build ?
08:00	<JyZky>	gnomefreak what is the right md5 for the ubuntu x86 desktop? cause some mirrors got other md5s than others
08:01	<DavidJaq>	is there any way to load from the CD if it's in the drive and I'm crashed to BusyBox in the process of loading an aparently damaged install of Dapper?
08:01	<boxemall>	i did  not change anything hardware related
08:01	<bbrazil>	JyZky: some might have the release candidate rather than the release
08:01	<madmike>	jlmr, don't ask to ask... just ask ;)
08:01	<midna>	when i boot up the new install cd the screen goes black after the brown ubuntu startup sequence, the sound plays but no video
08:01	<mada>	i'm out! ... lunch time
08:01	<jlmr>	grub, and the find /boot/grub/stage1 tells me it is installed in hd0,4 but i think it is in MBR, or am not getting anything?

08:03	<Ensiferum>	hi, someone know how to get the framebuffer working. i've added an alias for atyfb in /etc/modules.conf and then listed the alias in /etc/modules so the module gets loaded. also added a line for kernel parameters in grub.lst but all i still get is the default console
08:03	<r0xoR>	boxemall, which card may i ask?
08:03	<AnAnt>	anyone knows a reason for this?
08:03	<deus_>	TO THE APT-MOBILE!!!!

08:03	<r0xoR>	boxemall, what card?
08:03	<Andy101>	help, I tried to upgrade to dapper and now X won't start. Fails to load modules GLCore and nvidia (I had to switch to Windows, I haven't got commandline IRC)
08:03	<boxemall>	i have a terratec DMX6Fire (ICE1712 soundchip) same chipset as envy cards have
08:03	<madmike>	jlmr, so grub says stage is on hd0,4 ?
08:03	<vermoos>	midna: yup. wrong command?
08:03	<Hoxzer>	where does apt-get save its .deb?
08:04	<Hoxzer>	s
08:04	<jlmr>	madmike, perhaps you can tell me this, if i dd the first 446 bytes of MBR, the grub stage1 part, will it be enough to direct it to grub stage 2 on my ubuntu root partitiion?
08:04	<madmike>	stage1 even
08:04	<r0xoR>	Andy101, you will have to re-download or re-build your nvidia modules
08:04	<nanotube>	Hoxzer, /var/apt/cache
08:04	<NoUse>	JyZky ok, so verify that the CD has been burned properly by running that option from the boot cd
08:04	<paulproteus>	Hoxzer, /var/cache/apt/archives/
08:04	<jlmr>	madmike, yep
08:04	<sally_>	does anyone else have a laptop that gets less battery time in linux than windows?  what could be the problem?
08:04	<r0xoR>	Andy101, how did you get your nvidia modules before?
08:04	<h3sp4wn>	boxemail: Whats wrong with it (I use ice1712 (M-audio Delta 44))
08:04	<midna>	vermoos: no, that should work, i just did that on my server in my basement... ummm check your sources.list
08:04	<runes>	anyone know of a good PIM for calendar and appointment scheduling...I tried  Evolution but the smtp cannot connect to my ssl at sympatico
08:04	<midna>	vermoos: make sure they say dapper instead of breezy now
08:04	<paulproteus>	runes, You could try korganizer.
08:04	<nanotube>	sally_, could be not as efficient in throttling down cpu, or spinning down the disks...
08:04	<JyZky>	nouse ok ill try
08:04	<boxemall>	i don#t get sound working
08:04	<r0xoR>	boxemall, erm... actually i don't beleive it's the ICE chip... i beleive it's the Envy chip and the ice driver... but anyway
08:04	<r0xoR>	boxemall, i had to get my driver from opensound.com
08:04	<boxemall>	since i reinstalled ubuntu my sound does not work at all
08:04	<scifi>	midna: i just did the same and got same response ^^
08:04	<runes>	paulproteus will that work on Gnome desktop?
08:04	<Avian00>	anybody else having problems with dapper update repositories?
08:04	<vermoos>	midna: i've got universe and multiverse uncommented in my sources.list
08:04	<nnacht>	Hello again: about the totem for the divx-movies: mplayer and vlc plays the divx-files well. only totem does not. I had no problem in breezy
08:05	<paulproteus>	runes, Yes.
08:05	<paulproteus>	It'll look a bit funny, though.
08:05	<r0xoR>	boxemall, i have an m-audio card... and it happens to be the ONLY card out of all of theirs that doesn't have a working driver in the default kernel
08:05	<AnAnt>	I have a problem with Ubuntu Dapper, a friend of mine tried his MMC and it worked, so I decided to buy one, I found an MMC+, the buyer said they are the same, so I bought one, and I discovered that it doesn't work. Anyone has info on this ?
08:05	<runes>	woohoo thanx going to install it and try
08:05	<paulproteus>	runes, I'd really think Evolution should be able to do SSL'd SMTP, anyway.
08:05	<boxemall>	hmm
08:05	<boxemall>	so what could i do about that
08:05	<r0xoR>	boxemall, but 4front technologies has working drivers... they're not OSS but they're free
08:05	<Andy101>	r0xoR, followed instructions in Ubuntu docs about accelerating graphics, can't open yelp wthout X though
08:05	<JyZky>	nouse working well
08:05	<madmike>	jlmr, sorry don't know about MBR and stage1 grub (and stage1.5 for that matter)
08:05	<S>	shes here
08:05	<boxemall>	this problem makes my system inconsistent
08:05	<DavidJaq>	I could get a fresh install of ubuntu on this computer if I could boot from the cd from within the busybox console Dapper drops me into when it fails to boot, if someone could help me figure out how to do that
08:05	<midna>	scifi & vermoos: its beyond me, sorry, i'm pretty new at the whole linux thing, try the forums?
08:05	<S>	bohohohha ha ha ha

08:05	<S>	:D

08:05	<iNiku>	grr, hilight isn't working right on my irssi
08:05	<boxemall>	it seems that it is totally unstable
08:05	<S>	congrats to every one:D
08:05	<r0xoR>	boxemall, download the driver for your card
08:05	<madmike>	ntldr even
08:05	<r0xoR>	boxemall, read the instructions
08:06	<hazart>	Is there some mean of ensuring that ALL modules installed with module-helper gets re-compiled if a kernel update gets released?

08:06	<Amaranth>	angryElf: firmware goes in /lib/firmware
08:06	<jlmr>	madmike, ubuntu is pure experimental for me, windows remains my primary OS, i like to keep windows in front of everything else, i need for study/work etc..
08:06	<madmike>	jlmr, (well don't know enough to give certain advice when it comes to dd anyway ;)
08:06	<h3sp4wn>	boxemail: run alsa mixer are you using spdif ?

08:07	<Amaranth>	Overand: probably close to no changes
08:07	<h3sp4wn>	boxemail: alsamixer sorry
08:07	<r0xoR>	jlmr, you'll probably get over that one of these days :P
08:07	<paulproteus>	kalypso, But if you'll speak English you'll find help here.
08:07	<AngryElf1>	Amaranth, /lib/firmware or /lib/firmware/`uname -r` ?

08:07	<Andy101>	r0xoR:  thanks, will try as soon as I print something from ubuntu.com
08:07	<DavidJaq>	I could get a fresh install of ubuntu on this computer if I could boot from the cd from within the busybox console Dapper drops me into when it fails to boot, if someone could help me figure out how to do that
08:07	<JyZky>	nouse yes the browser
08:07	<Amaranth>	Overand: you can use synaptic to upgrade to the final version if you were using the rc
08:07	<boxemall>	even the panel is not responding
08:07	<NoUse>	JyZky browser?
08:07	<jlmr>	madmike, ok thnx
08:07	<Amaranth>	angryElf: it seems to work with either one
08:07	<dust_>	so i knew this once but... how do i add apps to my start up?
08:07	<boxemall>	i have to restart but i will be back in a few minutes (hope so,...)
08:07	<NoUse>	JyZky this program should run with booting off the CD, it shouldn't involve a browser
08:07	<madmike>	jlmr, Grub generally does a good job on booting windows i've got it working succesfully with windows 98 and XP
08:07	<vermoos>	scifi: ok.
08:07	<AngryElf1>	Amaranth, well i've actually got it in both, and several other places and dmesg keeps complaining it can't find it
08:08	<Amaranth>	angryElf: odd
08:08	<NoUse>	JyZky you shouldn't be in widows while this runs
08:08	<JyZky>	nouse yeye ive tried it but it comes the error...?
08:08	<Amaranth>	angryElf: this is for a kernel module?
08:08	<aedwards232>	using apt, how do you upgrade to dapper?
08:08	<jlmr>	madmike,  so far, it doesnt boot windows, otherwise it wouldnt be much of a problem, it just hangs when choosing windows
08:08	<AngryElf1>	Amaranth, yes
08:08	<JyZky>	nouse i can get the whole error msg if u want?
08:08	<anto9us>	Ajeeb71, see wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/
08:08	<madmike>	jlmr, there is also a win32 grub if you really want to boot windows before starting into ubuntu
08:08	<NoUse>	JyZky the verify program returned an error?
08:08	<midna>	is there a way to use the old text install on the new cd instead of going to a live cd install?
08:08	<Ajeeb71>	anto9us: thanks
08:08	<DavidJaq>	I could get a fresh install of ubuntu on this computer if I could boot from the cd from within the busybox console Dapper drops me into when it fails to boot, if someone could help me figure out how to do that

08:08	<N3o21>	Can someone help me? I need download gcc and kernel sources for dapper drake to compile modem drivers.
08:08	<madmike>	jlmr, so you allready got ubuntu installed but you can't boot windows anymore?
08:08	<runes>	paulproteus: they claim it does but I tried it ..it will connect to the pop server ssl but the smpt server times out..so to troubleshoot I tried thunderbird and it worked
08:09	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig ive tried... it works well the splashscreen
08:09	<NoUse>	JyZky you need to run a verify program from the boot menu, put the disc in your drive and reboot
08:09	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig but the install get some error
08:09	<NoUse>	JyZky you aren't listening
08:09	<jlmr>	madmike, yes thats part of the problem :D
08:09	<JyZky>	nouse it is the... very the cd from any efects

08:09	<ketsugi>	How do I configure the default bittorrent program? To use other ports, for example.
08:09	<Amaranth>	N3o21: you probably need to run sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-`uname -r`
08:10	<jlmr>	madmike, i could just use fixmbr or fdisk /mbr to get back to windows, bu then i would be unable to get into ubuntu
08:10	<Amaranth>	ketsugi: i don't think it offers that
08:10	<DavidJaq>	I could get a fresh install of ubuntu on this computer if I could boot from the cd from within the busybox console Dapper drops me into when it fails to boot, if someone could help me figure out how to do that

08:11	<madmike>	jlmr, this should be unneccessary grub is able to provide a (working) boot-menu
08:11	<wycats>	dust_ -- sessions in the  settings
08:11	<N3o21>	Amaranth: I must dowload it from the net in windows. Reboot to ubuntu, and install it.
08:11	<midna>	is there a way to use the old text install on the new cd instead of going to a live cd install?

08:16	<rukuartic>	can anyone confirm that?

08:17	<anto9us>	st, yes, this is the place to ask about any support issues with ubuntu, I don't know anything about xampp though, try again after waiting a while, someone else might :)
08:17	<sinbad444>	i dont know why
08:17	<highvoltage>	it's been ages since i've used ntfs
08:17	<Khamael>	DShepherd: how do I change it?
08:17	<madmike>	jlmr, i'm still on it ;)
08:17	<Avian00>	apt-get update spits out a bunch of 403 Forbidden errors.  Are the Dapper repositories down?
08:17	<Avian00>	apt-get update spits out a bunch of 403 Forbidden errors.  Are the Dapper repositories down?
08:17	<soundray>	rukuartic: I don't know... tried suid?
08:17	<Avian00>	if nobody can answer my question here, can somebody please direct me to where I CAN get a response?
08:17	<st>	ok. Thanks!
08:17	<midna>	is there a way to do a fresh install from a cd while inside breezy, or at least start it inside breezy
08:17	<jlmr>	madmike, ok, cool, im searching also
08:17	<midna>	avian: ubuntuforums.com
08:18	<sinbad444>	DShepherd: how do I change it?
08:18	<rukuartic>	soundray: I'm unfamiliar with that...
08:18	<Raskall>	hmm.. My last apt-get upgrade was yesterday. been running dapper for a couple of months. apt-get dist-upgrade says there's nothing to do. Do I have a final dapper on my laptop then?
08:18	<onkarshinde>	Anybody getting MD4 mismatch errors while upgrading with CD?
08:18	<midna>	is there a way to do a fresh install from a cd while inside breezy, or at least start it inside breezy
08:18	<sinbad444>	i want to be ABLE to shutdown Dapper !
08:18	<onkarshinde>	Raskall: Yes
08:18	<rukuartic>	Raskall: I had that happen to me as well. As far as I've been told, yes you are.
08:18	<Avian00>	ubuntuforms won't give me up-to-date info
08:18	<Avian00>	I have a vanilla CD instsasll of Dapper
08:18	<anto9us>	st, another tip, just ask your support question, you didn't really ask one :)
08:18	<DShepherd>	sinbad444: checking on it now
08:18	<Avian00>	I know my internet works
08:19	<sinbad444>	WHY doesnt Dapper allow me to Shutdown anyways ?
08:19	<Amaranth>	Raskall: yep, you're running the final version
08:19	<DShepherd>	Khamael:  checking on it now
08:19	<sinbad444>	okie
08:19	<midna>	Avian: i didn't see your question i was afk what did you ask?
08:19	<Avian00>	the only logical explination is that the repositories are down, can somebody confirm this?
08:19	<Lynoure>	rekrutacja: I might remember wrong, but I read that one needs to remove mention of the network interfaces (apart from loopback) from /etc/network/interfaces. Did that, after runnung the interfaces down. And it worked.
08:19	<dxdemetriou>	The gksudo "update-manager -d" is making correct upgrade? I have read that the update-manager will force to Dapper without the -d.
08:19	<rukuartic>	sinbad444: Eh.... linux was built to be server sized. So if someuser logged on and decided to reboot, it could cause a lot of problems.
08:19	<scifi>	can i just get some confirmation from someone that i need to replace all "breezy" references with "dapper" in my sources.list for sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to work ?
08:19	<midna>	Avian: ppl have been asking that on here recently... no real answer
08:19	<mjr>	scifi, ack
08:19	<rukuartic>	sinbad444: Just imagine working on your computer, and all of a sudden it shuts off.
08:19	<dsas>	scifi: yes
08:19	<midna>	scifi: yes
08:19	<soundray>	rukuartic: 'sudo chmod g+s binary' lets group members execute binary as root.
08:19	<scifi>	ty
08:20	<SurfnKid>	where'd spikeh go
08:20	<SurfnKid>	:P
08:20	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: You don't need the '-d' now that Dapper has been released.
08:20	<Lynoure>	rekrutacja: But I'm using it with kubuntu, so there might be some differences if you need further help
08:20	<midna>	is there a way to do a fresh install from a cd while inside breezy, or at least start it inside breezy
08:20	<PHiSQuaRE>	mmmm, I can't sudo, I think my hostname got fffed, how can I fix this little problem...
08:20	<r0xoR>	i've installed a lot of custom stuff in my breezy install: custom kernel compile, out of kernel-tree modules and FF1.5
08:20	<mjr>	soundray, incorrect. It will change the effective gid to the gid of the owner group
08:20	<r0xoR>	will an upgrade to dapper overwrite all that?
08:20	<rukuartic>	soundray: Ooof you kinda lost me on the syntax...
08:20	<Avian00>	I guess I can take that as I'm not the only having this problem
08:20	<dxdemetriou>	dsas: I know, but the update-manager don't give me the choice yet
08:20	<midna>	Avian: you are not
08:20	<sorush20>	hi
08:20	<soundray>	rukuartic: it was wrong anyway, as mjr pointed out
08:21	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: Does it work with the '-d' ?
08:21	<midna>	Avian: try using synaptic?
08:21	<Avian00>	ok.  thanks midna
08:21	<dxdemetriou>	dsas: yes
08:21	<ak7>	ok, I'm checking the md5sum of an iso in a terminal, and i'm getting different values for the same file, each time I run it
08:21	<flask->	wow, that upgrade didn't even REMOTELY work.
08:21	<eigenlambda>	wooo 1k ppls in #ubuntu wooo
08:21	<sorush20>	just testing the ubuntu to show off to my friend .. .some one say hi to geroge please..
08:21	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: Then use that then I guess.
08:21	<scifi>	what about the 1st line #deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 5.10 _Breezy Badger_ - Release i386 (20051012)] / breezy main restricted ?
08:21	<midna>	ak7: do a memtest
08:21	<eigenlambda>	we're more popular than debian
08:21	<Amaranth>	Avian00: the repos are working fine for me
08:21	<rukuartic>	mjr: Would you happen to know how I could allow one user to run "reboot" without using sudo?
08:21	<Amaranth>	Avian00: your mirror might be overloaded
08:21	<WildChild>	I just installed Dapper Drake but now I have a framebuffer problem with a 3dfx Voodoo 3 3000, does anyone has the same problem? I doesn't see anything until X.org start
08:21	<sinbad444>	wow the Dapper upgrade today is  SLOW  slow  sLoW
08:21	<r0xoR>	flask-, uh oh, heheheh, what's wrong?
08:21	<vermoos>	scifi: geez i've got 547 upgrades to do, which popped up in the synaptics gui * after * doing apt-get update
08:21	<dcraven>	Hi geroge
08:21	<zkl-laptop>	hmm, can't start gnome-session from gdm
08:21	<PHiSQuaRE>	mmmm, I can't sudo, I think my hostname got fffed, how can I fix this little problem?
08:21	<midna>	is there a way to do a fresh install from a cd while inside breezy, or at least start it inside breezy
08:21	<rukuartic>	sinbad444: Its hot stuff :)
08:21	<midna>	?
08:22	<Avian00>	Amaranth: how can I specify a different mirror?  I've been searching google and ubuntuforms for that without any luck
08:22	<onkarshinde>	scifi: You can comment that. And if you have dapper CD then do 'susdo apt-cdrom add'
08:22	<flask->	r0xor: ran update-manager -d, it did its thing and said it had to reboot. rebooted and no upgrade had taken place.
08:22	<ak7>	midna: bad memory can do that? :/
08:22	<Simthumb>	Hi I had a few questions about Ubuntu
08:22	<Amaranth>	midna: no, but you can use the CD to do a dist-upgrade
08:22	<dxdemetriou>	dsas: I have the cy.archive.ubuntu... It will be this the reason?
08:22	<sinbad444>	haha yeah but im only getting like 3-5Kbps !!
08:22	<rukuartic>	midna: If you shut down and put the CD in, you might be able to boot from CD and install that way :)
08:22	<mjr>	rukuartic, I would recommend sudo anyway
08:22	<r0xoR>	flask-, you have to use dist-upgrade
08:22	<xeta>	HAPPY DAPPER DAY!
08:22	<flask->	r0xor: then I tried to manually run dist-upgrade and it complained about all my xorg-* packages needing to be removed... so I let it
08:22	<xiko>	hmm just upgraded it to dapper, everything working right
08:22	<Amaranth>	Avian00: you have to manually edit your sources.list
08:22	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: Possibly, not all mirrors will update as quick as others.
08:22	<midna>	rukuartic: cd kills my display.. as soon as it finishes booting the stupid screen goes black
08:22	<rekrutacja>	Lynoure: hmmm, i use pcmcia atheros card (madwifi driver) and remember that i have to edit sth in this file to get it running
08:22	<mjr>	rukuartic, but you could make it 4750 and owned by a group that can execute it as root
08:22	<rukuartic>	mjr: Hmm. Lemme look on editing sudoers file...
08:22	<r0xoR>	flask-, did you read and or follow any instructions? and if so which ones?
08:22	<JyZky>	nouse
08:23	<midna>	ak7: had the same problem, bad memory was my problem.. don't really know
08:23	<JyZky>	nouse 3 check summar failed
08:23	<flask->	r0xoR: i followed the instructions in the Wiki article in the topic.
08:23	<rukuartic>	mjr: Ooooh... Make a group called "shutdown" or something, add users to that group?
08:23	<Avian00>	Amaranth: where can I find a list of mirrors?
08:23	<r0xoR>	k
08:23	<eXistenZ>	What might cause my ff to browse slowly? It downloads files fast though
08:23	<JyZky>	NoUse 3 check summars failed
08:23	<Lynoure>	rekrutacja: where   this = ?
08:23	<Amaranth>	Avian00: i dunno
08:23	<flask->	r0xoR: and now when i try to run dist-upgrade it doesn't indicate that there's any upgrade to perform
08:23	<midna>	Amaranth: thank you.. i might resort to that, but i would really like to just get a vanilla install
08:23	<madmike>	jlmr, what does the /boot/grub/menu.lst look like (for the windows part anyway) ?
08:23	<ak7>	midna: well, thanks... not sure about the status of my warranty, that's all :(
08:23	<Amaranth>	Avian00: i just use archive.ubuntu.com
08:23	<r0xoR>	flask-, and i just have to ask... yo'ure sure that you followed them correctly and in the right order and what not?
08:23	<shachaf>	Is anyone else here having trouble with the ATi drivers?
08:23	<pike__>	eXistenZ: ipv6? or regular dns problem?
08:23	<shachaf>	They stopped working suddenly.
08:23	<Raskall>	well, then it just remains to upgrade wifey's laptop and the server.
08:23	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: I use an atheros card and madwifi too, what's your problem?
08:23	<flask->	r0xoR: yep, I'm not new at this by any means
08:23	<shachaf>	And won't compile now.
08:23	<midna>	ak7: sorry, a memtest would tell you if its bad at least.. could be good/bad news
08:23	<spikeh>	ATI drivers aren't working?
08:24	<rukuartic>	mjr Its odd... I just looked at reboot in /sbin, its got rwxrwxrwx
08:24	<r0xoR>	k
08:24	<jlmr>	madmike, ok, trying to find that :p
08:24	<eXistenZ>	pike__, How can I fix either?
08:24	<midna>	ak7: could also be normal discrepencies in large files
08:24	<JyZky>	nouse 3 check summar errors
08:24	<Avian00>	Amaranth: that's the same one I'm using. some of them work, others do not
08:24	<shachaf>	spikeh: Not for me.
08:24	<zambba>	I dist-upgraded my Dapper system today
08:24	<scifi>	vermoos: i dont think i have to install all those tho, just updates the list
08:24	<shachaf>	spikeh: This is a Radeon Xpress 200M.
08:24	<madmike>	jlmr, just open a terminal ans write 'gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst' (without the ')

08:25	<[zero] >	Amaranth: could you help me with this mount business?
08:25	<DShepherd>	Khamael, sinbad444.. i can seem to find anything.. maybe i was mistaken
08:25	<Simthumb>	Does Ubuntu replace Windows (XP) or...?
08:25	<Raskall>	but on my server I have only installed software from the ubuntu repos. I _should_ be ok dist-upgrading, right?
08:25	<[zero] >	please

08:25	<scifi>	vermoos: hmmm NOW its saying 577 updates in pop-menu too lol
08:25	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Depends on how you install it. You can have it completely take over the hard drive, or share it.
08:25	<shachaf>	spikeh: I'm trying to compile the latest fglrx drivers.
08:25	<aedwards232>	I tryed gksudo "update-manager -d" and got this "After your package information was updated the essential package 'ubuntu-base' can not be found anymore." is this a known issue?
08:25	<zkl-laptop>	.xsession-errors isn't telling me anything insightful either
08:25	<sinbad444>	DShep,  thx anyways !!  :)
08:26	<shachaf>	spikeh: Though I tried the old ones too.
08:26	<vermoos>	scifi: yeah ditto
08:26	<midna>	when i boot up the new install cd the screen goes black after the brown ubuntu startup sequence, the sound plays but no video any ideas?
08:26	<DShepherd>	Khamael, sinbad444 that was cant not can
08:26	<spikeh>	shachaf: oh? I'm just using apt-get xorg-drivers-fglrx
08:26	<DShepherd>	sinbad444: sure,, no prob
08:26	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: NetworkManager is not working
08:26	<spikeh>	shachaf: not sure if it will work yet :D
08:26	<shachaf>	spikeh: I'll try that, I guess.
08:26	<ifxx>	hey @all ... has anyone set up the sgi performer with ubuntu??
08:26	<scifi>	vermoos: said it cant install all of them, says i need to do "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in console, so im gonna do that now
08:26	<Avian00>	Amaranth: Thanks for your help
08:26	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: at all? what does it do?
08:26	<sinbad444>	hey guys how do i disable quits/join messages in xchat-gnome ?? i looked everywhere
08:26	<soundray>	midna: do you get a console login when you hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 ?
08:26	<madmike>	what does 'sudo fdisk -l' say?
08:26	<Simthumb>	@rukuartic Can it partition my hard drive?
08:27	<scifi>	vermoos: hmmm or shud i install these updates first ?
08:27	<madmike>	jlmr, what does 'sudo fdisk -l' say?
08:27	<midna>	soundray: yes i do
08:27	<flask->	r0xoR: nevermind, i think it was a sources.list problem
08:27	<Ohzie>	>	Hey, I was here earlier and someone told me that to fix my problem I had to run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg but that isn't helping.
08:27	<rukuartic>	sinbad444: /part (channel) (message)
08:27	<r0xoR>	flask-, ahh i see
08:27	<DavidJaq>	in the wiki I see a confusing instruction... 'Extract grldr from the archive to c:\grldr. The rest of the files in the archive are unnecessary. (If your default compression/archive program doesn't like *.gz files, try 7-Zip from www.7-zip.org.)'
08:27	<vermoos>	scifi: i think the updates which come through the gui *are* the ugrade to dapper

08:27	<flask->	r0xoR: copied one off the forums, reran apt-get update, re-ran dist-upgrade and now it's flyin
08:27	<aedwards232>	I tryed gksudo "update-manager -d" and got this "After your package information was updated the essential package 'ubuntu-base' can not be found anymore." is this a known issue?
08:27	<DavidJaq>	does that mean that I should extract grldr to the C drive or into a folder called grldr on the c drive?
08:27	<scifi>	vermoos: ok ive pressed "install updates" now
08:27	<r0xoR>	flask-, hehehe, i fought with my computer a bunch last time... then realized i was just a little bit sped and took a notch of my ego :)
08:28	<madmike>	jlmr, (i.e. is windows xp really on this first partition?!)
08:28	<rukuartic>	[zero] : what type of filesystem is it?
08:28	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: i had to start dhclient manually in order to connect
08:28	<soundray>	midna: log in there, run 'sudo dpgk-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and set the video driver to vesa (leave everything else as is, say no to autodetection).
08:28	<r0xoR>	flask-, lemme know how it works :)
08:28	<jldWork>	so is it safe to use "update-manager -d" to upgrade to dapper, or will that go to "edgey eft"?
08:28	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: does it show any networks available in the menu?
08:28	<Simthumb>	Do I have to manually partition my disk?
08:28	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: NO
08:28	<scifi>	vermoos: and i will also do a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade when they have completed installing
08:28	<[zero] >	rukuartic: W95 FAT32
08:28	<Simthumb>	Or will it automatically partition?
08:28	<midna>	soundray: ok i'll try that.. thank you greatly
08:28	<Simthumb>	Or no partition at all?
08:28	<Khamael>	DShepherd: I looked at some screenshots of dapper, and the shutdown function is there

08:30	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: or do I have to do it?
08:30	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: yes it does, but its a tad risky. I lost my ntfs partition once--fortunately there was nothing on it
08:30	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: this is my /etc/network/interfaces file http://pastebin.com/751819
08:30	<Simthumb>	With a 3rd party software?
08:30	<Getwild2>	I get the error, "Can't resolve host name "unix"!", whenever I execute a command in the shell.  Any ideas?
08:31	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Wow...so then how do I partition?
08:31	<jlmr>	madmike, it looks alright doesnt it, but it doesnt work
08:31	<[zero] >	rukuartic: now when I click on it nothing happens?
08:31	<jab>	Performancevise how does a debian x86 (userland) with an 64-bits kernel perform vs. ubuntu amd64 on a AMD64 CPU system?
08:31	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: The live CD does it for you. How much data do you have on your drive?
08:31	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: did you comment out the ath0 lines before trying network manager?
08:31	<stjepan>	anyone here runs the stable dapper?
08:31	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Should I dare try using command-line?
08:31	<jlmr>	mamike, thats why i wanted to switch back to ntldr
08:31	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: NM won't touch interfaces that have configs in /etc/network/interfaces
08:31	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: lol about 35gigs
08:31	<stjepan>	any thoughs of the new dapper? any experiences?
08:31	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: no. ath0 is my pcmcia wifi card
08:31	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: did you get ubuntu working?
08:31	<Booo>	is there a problem with iso for ppc?
08:31	<jlmr>	madmike, thats why i wanted to switch back to ntldr
08:31	<rukuartic>	[zero] : You probably have to be the super user to open the folder... try this... open a terminal and do "sudo -i;cd /media/fat32"
08:31	<gil>	i have a toshiba m40x....i cant for the life of me get the Card reader to pick up an inserted card
08:31	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Out of how much space?
08:31	<scifi>	vermoos: maxing out my measly 1mbit, package servers must be getting hammered, but still managing to max me out :D
08:31	<stjepan>	I'm just running dapper now 8-)
08:31	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: yes, you have to comment it out in /etc/network/interfaces if you want to use NM
08:31	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: ok, will try hashing it
08:31	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: out of 37gig
08:32	<soundray>	jab, it makes little difference for desktop type applications.
08:32	<rekrutacja>	thanks all
08:32	<jbrouhard>	Howdy...
08:32	<GreatBriton>	i get an error message when trying to activate the nvidia graphics driver on dapper, help please?
08:32	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: eth0 too
08:32	<xetas>	stjepen: its awesome, how r u liking it
08:32	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: if you want NM to manage that
08:32	<jbrouhard>	Anyone have trouble running sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre ?
08:32	<madmike>	jlmr, it really could be that grub is installed on the MBR and that XP doesn't want to boot because of this
08:32	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: do I have to free more space?
08:32	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Oooooh. That'd be bad. What I reccommend is this, get a second hard drive, plug the blank hard drive in as the primary and the full hard drive (windows) as the second. When you install from the CD, tell it to install to the blank hard drive.
08:32	<h3h_timo>	is there a way to change the ethernet adapter that you are using?
08:32	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Yea, you kinda need about 2 gigs for Linux and 512 for swap.
08:32	<iNiku>	damnit... why isn't my irssi hilight working
08:32	<dxdemetriou>	It didn't work the update-manager for upgrade yet. If I use the cd it will be ok with the update manager?
08:32	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oy-vey
08:33	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: You PROBABLY could do it, but it'd be really tight and kinda risky
08:33	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: So how big a hard drive do I need?
08:33	<buzzed>	any good website capture utilities for offline viewing of a site
08:33	<buzzed>	?
08:33	<ak7>	midna: found the problem... was running the md5sum on the torrent I'm still downloading :)
08:33	<jlmr>	madmike, but it is strange my windows partition is marked as active, and grub find tells me that grub is installed on hd0,4
08:33	<dsas>	buzzed: wget if you fancy the command line.
08:33	<soundray>	h3h_timo: what exactly are you trying to do?
08:33	<jab>	soundray: were does the difference appear?
08:33	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Wow...
08:33	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: 3 gigs minimum. I'm sitting comfortably on a 80 right now. Four partitions. Windows, Linux, Swap, and a drive to share between the twol
08:33	<dsas>	buzzed: There may be some graphical applications for it, I don't know any offhand though.
08:33	<Booo>	seem to a problem iso for ppc
08:33	<GreatBriton>	i get an error message when trying to activate the nvidia graphics driver on dapper, help please?
08:33	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Wow!
08:33	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: No, don't get me wrong. You can install linux on your 37 gb hard drive. I really don't reccommend it though
08:33	<soundray>	jab, in numbercrunching/memory I/O intensive applications.
08:34	<buzzed>	wget may work
08:34	<jab>	soundray: ok, thanks :)
08:34	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: If I do install it on my 37gig,
08:34	<h3h_timo>	soundray, my etherent doesnt work.. i have a davicom etherent device.. and the driver is tulip compatible i think.. but it never connects.. it worked before i upgraded.. but not now
08:34	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: What are the risks?
08:34	<avarab>	heh, my ubuntu dist-upgrade failed
08:34	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Losing my data?
08:34	<avarab>	'python2.4-twisted: Depends: python2.4-twisted-conch (>= 1:0.6) but it is not installed'
08:34	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Losing data, possibly messing up your hard drive
08:34	<psycose>	hi i'm using Dapper up to date, and i'm trying to install the nvidia-glx driver ... sounds like the procedure may as changed. any good doc ?
08:34	<soundray>	h3h_timo: is the tulip driver loaded?
08:34	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oy
08:34	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Well, not permanantly messing it up
08:34	<[zero] >	rukuartic:  it worked THANKX!!! :D:D:D
08:34	<rukuartic>	[zero] : No problem
08:34	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: So if I get 2 disk drives,
08:34	<jaek>	Simthumb, 37 gigs is plenty... just keep the porn down to managable levels
08:34	<[zero] >	rukuartic:  you are A LEGEND!!
08:35	<rukuartic>	[zero] : Its not permanant though. as soon as you reboot it will unmount. And no thats Seveas
08:35	<Simthumb>	jaek: the what?????
08:35	<midna>	soundray: YOU ARE MY HERO! my display works now! woohoo!
08:35	<rukuartic>	[zero] : To make it permanant you need to put this in fstab
08:35	<jaek>	Simthumb, you know what i'm talking about ;)
08:35	<spikeh>	I'm in Ubuntu, but where's the installation screen?
08:35	<Simthumb>	jaek: no I don't jaek
08:35	<T-CAN>	i have linux installed on a 7gig hard :)
08:35	<rukuartic>	jaek: he's got a 37 gig drive with 35 gig of data
08:35	<spikeh>	I did not download the LiveCD?
08:35	<T-CAN>	*harddrve
08:35	<[zero] >	rukuartic: fstab?
08:35	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: so will an 8gig be enough?
08:35	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig no
=== _Cass is now known as Cass
08:35	<madmike>	jlmr, I'm out know-how here sorry... If I were you, i'd really install ntldr again (as you said) and try to install grub from the ubuntu live-cd again later (or with a knoppix-cd)
08:35	<rukuartic>	Sim plenty
08:35	<soundray>	midna: it's only a work-around. Read the wiki on ATI or NVidia-specific drivers.
08:35	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig 3 checking summary errors
08:35	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: if I have 2 HDDs, can I choose to log on into Windows or Linux?
08:35	<rukuartic>	[zero] : yes, fstab is basically a file that tells Linux what to mount at the boot
08:35	<dsas>	spikeh: There should be an icon in the top corner saying "install"
08:35	<GreatBriton>	psycose: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia has worked for me, up until it comes to activating the driver, which fails for me and i need help with
08:35	<soundray>	midna: if that's what you have
08:36	<jaek>	Simthumb, rukuartic: oooh, i see....
08:36	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: You can have two or 1 hd and boot into linux or windows
08:36	<dsas>	spikeh: Top corner of the desktop that is.
08:36	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: If you have two, the first (primary/master) hard drive needs to have linux on it
08:36	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: did you burn the cd image onto a cd?
08:36	<spikeh>	dsas I have clicked it but nothing is happening
08:36	<[zero] >	rukuartic: ah k, any chance you could tell me how to do that?
08:36	<midna>	soundray: yes i have nvidia.. thank you very much for the starting point.. i'll start lookin
08:36	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oh I see
08:36	<h3h_timo>	soundray, i have no idea
08:36	<rukuartic>	[zero] : Sure thing. Here, i'll give you a line
08:36	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig yes with Nero
08:36	<soundray>	!tell midna about nvidia
08:36	<livevil>	does someone know a valid italian server for dictionary?
08:36	<jlmr>	madmike,  any idea how to reinstall grub from livecd?
08:36	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I have a used 8gig HDD from my old comp which I can plug into this one
08:37	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: now leave the cd in the cd drive and reboot your computerr
08:37	<soundray>	h3h_timo: do a 'lsmod | grep tulip' and see if it generates any output.
08:37	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: but will the live CD modify my current HDD?
08:37	<ubun>	olhei desculpei mas no queria entrar neste canal.
08:37	<dsas>	spikeh: Odd, you did double click it right? It should launch a new window.
08:37	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: If I install it on this 37gig one
08:37	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig i just did it
08:37	<luna_>	nerea_trevelez@hotmail.com
08:37	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig it said 3 fails
08:37	<rukuartic>	[zero] : /dev/sda4       /media/share    vfat    rw,dev,exec,auto,user,sync,utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       1

08:37	<gil>	i have a toshiba m40x....i cant for the life of me get the Card reader to pick up an inserted card
08:37	<madmike>	jlmr, it's almost the same as when you run it from a 'real' one. You just need to run grub with some more options
08:37	<Auckland_Pig>	hmmmm... how did you download the .iso file?
08:37	<rukuartic>	[zero] : put that line in /etc/fstab, and change /dev/sda4 to /dev/hdb5
08:37	<spikeh>	dsas yes I have double clicked it; and it says starting administrative application at the bottom but then it disappears
08:37	<taan>	hi, where did the X configuration utility go? (used to be xf86config, XFconfig, system-..., etc)
08:37	<spikeh>	dsas it was a bit hit and miss getting Xserver working; could this be the issue?
08:37	<[zero] >	ok
08:38	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: No, the live CD won't modify your current unless you tell it to install
08:38	<T-CAN>	rukuartic, vfat is read-only though right?
08:38	<madmike>	jlmr, 'grub-install /dev/hd...'
08:38	<C_REATiVE_>	what does dapper writes after install oem, how can i setup the users ?
08:38	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: What it does is use your RAM like a hard drive and puts itself on there
08:38	<jlmr>	madmike, ok, ill figure it out, thnx for your help
08:38	<rukuartic>	T-CAN: No, thats NTFS
08:38	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: that's what I mean...
08:38	<luna_>	luna_trevelez@hotmail.com
08:38	<dsas>	spikeh: Possibly, I'm not to hot on the live cd install personally. It may be better if someone else tries to help you.
08:38	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oh...
08:38	<h3h_timo>	soundray... just like you typed it?
08:38	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Nope. Until you double click "Install to HD" then it doesn't touch your hard drive.
08:38	<kbrooks>	luna_: DONT POST YOUR EMAIL
08:38	<madmike>	jlmr, your welcome ... good luck
08:38	<kane777>	so... the most common question today, i think... how do I upgrade to dapper??
08:38	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: So there is a pretty big risk I could lose some files?
08:38	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig 3 checking summary fails
08:39	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: No, if you do it very carefully you should be fine.
08:39	<T-CAN>	rukuartic, so in fstab i can set umask to 0755 and be able to r/w/execute?
08:39	<spikeh>	could someone else please explain to me why the install script isn't working?
08:39	<iNiku>	kane777: read the topic
08:39	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: you might probably need to download again...
08:39	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: But you'd have to be VERY careful. And I wouldn't risk it.
08:39	<evi|one>	I don't want ubuntu to place icons for the drives mounted in /media on the desktop. How do I stop it from doing that?
08:39	<kane777>	!upgrade
08:39	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig ok... from where :) ?
08:39	<soundray>	h3h_timo: without the quotes.
08:39	<rukuartic>	T-CAN: ...I think. I'm not a fstab whiz.
08:39	<Booo>	has anyone here install the ppc version ?
08:39	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: LOL.
08:39	<h3h_timo>	alright.. ill try it
08:39	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig from where have you downloaded it
08:39	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: What if I backup most of my stuff?
08:39	<kbrooks>	evi|one: you don't.
08:39	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig what mirror
08:39	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Mostly all the junk is games and my web designs
08:39	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: If you do decide to do it, first defragment your hard drive and put all your files together
08:39	<pike__>	evi|one: edit the /etc/fstab file
08:40	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Yea, definately clear up space if you can.
08:40	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Yeah...
08:40	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: did you get it working?
08:40	<kbrooks>	Sinistrad: games?
08:40	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
08:40	<evi|one>	kbrooks: you're positive there's no way to prevent that?
08:40	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I'll try
08:40	<kbrooks>	Simthumb: what games?
08:40	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I think I can clear up at least a few gigs
08:40	<DavidJaq>	How do I uninstall grub?
08:40	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: But yeah. Back up all your data, delete anything you don't need, move files from HD to CD's etc
08:40	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: not yet i have to take my sone to bathroom right now :-)
08:40	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: hope it works
08:40	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig burn to cd and test again?
08:40	<Raskall>	there. started dist-upgrade on my server too... *saying a small prayer*
08:40	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I have  a download folder that's holding a ton of junk
08:40	<shachaf>	When I try to load the fglrx module, I get "*ERROR* firegl_stub_register failed". I can't find any information about that -- has anyone else had this problem?
08:40	<kbrooks>	evi|one: pretty sure, but less than positive
08:40	<iNiku>	rekrutacja: haha, okay, first things first :)
08:40	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Also try clearing Temporary Files
08:40	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig ill change cd
08:40	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Lol, The Sims, The Sims 2, Sim stuff
08:40	<phatmonkey>	i am running dapper RC using http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu repositories. have these not been updated yet? I see no upgrades in apt
08:40	<evi|one>	kbrooks: alright, thanks
08:41	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Thats C:\Documents and Settings\Your Name\Temporary I think
08:41	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig maybie its a scratch on the cd ^^
08:41	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: And can Windows programs run in Linux?
08:41	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: or you can do a md5 checksum before you burn
08:41	<kbrooks>	Simthumb: depends.
08:41	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Most of them can with a program called "Wine"
08:41	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: probably...
08:41	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oy
08:41	<Sub>	!wine
08:41	<ubotu>	Wine is a compatibility layer for running windows programs on linux. Get the latest .deb from http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/binary/ or see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wine for more info.
08:41	<T-CAN>	ubotu tell T-CAN about cli
08:41	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: But not all of them do, or at least very well.
08:41	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig its downloading
08:41	<Auckland_Pig>	!md5
08:41	<ubotu>	I guess md5 is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto
08:41	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oh boy....
08:41	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: There, read what ubotu just said about wine.
08:41	<dsas>	phatmonkey: I'm using the same one, they are updated.
08:41	<[zero] >	rukuartic: do I put that line in a file for fstab? :S
08:41	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig msn?
08:41	<DavidJaq>	How do I uninstall grub?
08:41	<uscg_corey>	anyone know when i try to run a steaming video hru firefox with the totem xine player it shows a blue screen where ideo should be then screen goes black
08:41	<iNiku>	so boring... no updates in over 24 hours, I think :)
08:41	<kbrooks>	!tell me about wine
08:41	<phatmonkey>	dsas, are there many packages? I got two earlier today, but that's it
08:42	<vermoos>	scifi: it says "run "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" in a terminal to update your system completely."
08:42	<rukuartic>	[zero] : Yep. Make sure you're editing the file as root (gksudo gedit /etc/fstab)
08:42	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: ah ok
08:42	<[zero] >	kk
08:42	<scifi>	vermoos: yep sounds right
08:42	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: But,
08:42	<psycose>	GreatBriton Can Geforce fx 5200 be considered as geforce1 or geforce2 ?
08:42	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: If I wanna run my games or stuff,
08:42	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: verify the iso before you burn
08:42	<Ohzie>	Anybody having issues with getting their xserver running, install the new version of your nvidia or ati modules by installing the package linux-restricted-modules-(uname -r)
08:42	<dsas>	phatmonkey: You're probably updated to the final release
08:42	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I can just log onto Windows and run them right?
08:42	<scifi>	vermoos: mines installing installing remaining updates
08:42	<bionic>	any descent video editing prog for linux?
08:42	<gil>	will someone please help me with a toshiba built in card reader....
08:42	<soundray>	Simthumb: you'd have to reboot.
08:42	<dsas>	phatmonkey: Have you ran "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" ?
08:42	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I just wanna keep Ubuntu for my office-stuff
08:42	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Yeah. Games are best run from windows.
08:43	<Fast>	is the a non-live cd installer for breezy?
08:43	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Thats what I do :P
08:43	<Simthumb>	soundray: That's not a big deal for me :P
08:43	<soundray>	bionic: cinelerra seems to make waves
08:43	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: heheheh :P
08:43	<phatmonkey>	dsas, yes. is there any sneaky way to tell what i am running?
08:43	<soundray>	Simthumb: read the wiki on dual booting
08:43	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig ugotmsn?
08:43	<soundray>	!tell Simthumb about dualboot
08:43	<phatmonkey>	i'm guessing the rc is the same, so suppose not
08:43	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: There's wiki on that?
08:43	<vermoos>	scifi: ... which is taking a while....
08:43	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I've been looking all night for it!
08:43	<Auckland_Pig>	JyZky: no...
08:43	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Its also difficult to share files between Windows and Linux... NTFS and EXT3 (linux) don't talk with each other.
08:43	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: ROFL
08:43	<madmike>	!tell madmike about dualboot
08:43	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Oh yeah, its called dual booting.
08:43	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig kk
08:43	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig brb
08:43	<T-CAN>	ubotu tell T-CAN about permissions
08:43	<rukuartic>	madmike: /msg ubotu dual booting
08:44	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: /me goes to look
=== sub|off is now known as subsinker
08:44	<morten__>	you can share files easily if you get a nfs server for windows
08:44	<Raskall>	what the heck? Is there a 10 CD maximum on shipit now? Who do I call to get/buy more cd's? I'm starting up my ubuntu company now and need more than 10 cd's.
08:44	<rukuartic>	morten__: I just made a fat32 share
08:44	<soundray>	morten__: only if you have at least two computers, though ;)
08:44	<dsas>	phatmonkey: What does dpkg -l pcmicia-cs give you?
08:44	<BWD>	what package do i need to install to play mp3s?
08:45	<rukuartic>	Raskall: Its not like windows where you can only use the CD once and it self destruscts :P
08:45	<gil>	ohzie:?
08:45	<dsas>	!tell bwd about mp3
08:45	<BWD>	dsas: thank you
08:45	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, yea....  1 CD is still enough for a whole company...  : )
08:45	<Raskall>	rukuartic: I know, but I plan to get more than 10 customers for my company. :)
08:45	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: is it a good idea to have all my stuff backed up by a comp tech?
08:45	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: b/c I have a broken cd burner
08:45	<jason^>	i'm having problems with the installer, it just keeps blinking and my monitors say it's in power save mode
08:45	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Nooo you can do al that yourself
08:45	<sally_>	how do I get the network manager applet to show?  I installed gnome-network-manager
08:45	<soundray>	Raskall: you're allowed to make your own copies
08:45	<RandolphCarter>	hmm, beagle-build-in seems to have got itself stuck in an infinite loop (posting output of ltrace)
08:45	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Ha-ha, thought so
08:45	<Ohzie>	gil: nevermind
08:46	<mjmac>	anyone gotten Xgl/Compiz working on AMD64/nvidia?
08:46	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Ooooh. Then yea it might be nice to do that
08:46	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, if you want more give me your address and 1$ per CD and I'll create as many as you would like   : )
08:46	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: oh lol
08:46	<Raskall>	FunnyLookinHat: I am going to sell server installations of ubuntu and SLA's to small and medium size companies. The customers will probably like to get "original" cd's instead of a home-burned one
08:46	<morten__>	soundray, yes
08:46	<mjmac>	compiz segfaults when i run it
08:46	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Just purchase a cheap hard drive
08:46	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: They're not too expensive
08:46	<gil>	ohzie: i am sorry i am not regsitered
08:46	<nexus10>	Can anyone advise what's the best way to share a server directory with Linux laptops? Tried NFS (which is s_l_o_w), smbfs(cannot control perms), sshfs(cannot get it to automount) -- recommendations?
08:46	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: yeah...
08:46	<gil>	can you please tell me what info you have
08:46	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I have an old one that's 8gigs
08:46	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, ooh, well if that's the case....  you should pay shipit rather than just make a profit off of what they are giving you for free.
08:46	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: That works
08:46	<Booo>	I am newbie at this what iso should i be d/l if i want to have dapper install permantely?
08:46	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Problem is, I'm afraid to install it myself - I'm not much of a hardware person
08:46	<rukuartic>	Raskall: Yeah.
08:46	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: lol
08:46	<shachaf>	sally_: Run "nm-applet".
08:46	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, you may run into some issues selling those CDs....  legal issues.
08:47	<shachaf>	sally_: Or log out and back in.
08:47	<krazykit>	Booo: either the alternative install or the livecd
08:47	<nomis__>	my mouse cursor flickers when I load a programm, since I use the nvidia-glx. Anybody an idea what I can do?
08:47	<Raskall>	FunnyLookinHat: hence "who do I call to get/buy more cd's"
08:47	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Its not too hard. Get help from a friend
08:47	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: yeah
08:47	<Ohzie>	gil: Oh.
08:47	<Raskall>	FunnyLookinHat: not selling cd's. selling a server install.
08:47	<BWD>	nomis__: i experience the same thing
08:47	<Sithik>	hey all
08:47	<soundray>	nexus10: how slow is NFS for you? Works fine for me.
08:47	<Sithik>	quick question
08:47	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: ok by deleting some old files, I cleared up about another gig
08:48	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: That works
08:48	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I have about 4 gigs free
08:48	<jayrod06>	hey guys
08:48	<Booo>	krazykit: I dont see liveCD
08:48	<Simthumb>	rukuartic is that enough?
08:48	<Sithik>	where exactly can i download the LiveCD?
08:48	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Well, the more the better.
08:48	<Fast>	the installer keeps locking up on the dapper live install cd... is there a dapper installer that isn't combined with a live cd?
08:48	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: cool :D
08:48	<rukuartic>	Booo: Desktop = livecd
08:48	<dsas>	Booo: It's called the desktop cd
08:48	<Raskall>	FunnyLookinHat: for companies that need/want to save money buying expensive firewalls, windows servers and mail servers
08:48	<michaels>	(gedit:12894): Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by Xlib - what does this mean?
08:48	<ben42>	a friend of mine updated to dapper today and lost all his network - devices besides the loopback-device
08:48	<dsas>	Fast: Get the 'alternative' cd
08:48	<jayrod06>	anyone run it on a mac yet? preferably a macbook or macbook pro
08:48	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, wait...  so you're just installing a server for them?  then use burned CDs.   : )
08:48	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Yep
08:48	<hazart>	Is there a way to rebuild all modules that was made with module-assistant when a new kernel gets installed? If not, automatic updates could make the system boot a new kernel, without AFS modules installed.
08:48	<ben42>	is it a known problem?
08:48	<kenni>	Does new ubuntu support nvidia geforce 7900gt graphics card?  (The doc at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia doesn't do the trick - the driver fails to recognice the card apparently - even claiming the card is of ATI brand in the xorg.conf!).
08:48	<Booo>	dsas which is better?
08:48	<dsas>	jayrod06: People have.
08:48	<nexus10>	soundray: about 3+ minutes to connect :-(
08:48	<FunnyLookinHat>	Sounds like you should custom build an OEM type CD anyways
08:48	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: And did you order the LiveCD by mail?
08:48	<sally_>	shachaf: I've used network-manager applet before and I thought it showed a list of available access points when you click on it.  when I click on this icon it doesnt show a list of access points, it just lets me configure the interface through the ubuntu network-admin, am I missing something?
08:48	<rendo>	How do you do that 3d moving of the desktop in Dapper?
08:48	<soundray>	nexus10: that can be helped...
08:48	<FunnyLookinHat>	kenni, Yes, I use it and works great
08:48	<no0ke>	!rc
08:48	<ubotu>	To Upgrade from RC to final, just: sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
08:48	<rukuartic>	Raskall: They have the images to stamp ont he CD, just print them out and put them on yourself
08:48	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Any idea how long it really takes? (they say 4-6 weeks,I just ordered it yesterday)
08:49	<Raskall>	FunnyLookinHat: Customers often like a physical product they can touch and that looks good in their shelf.
08:49	<FunnyLookinHat>	kenni, the 8756 driver (newest) is the only one that supports it
=== gil is now known as gilster
08:49	<dsas>	Booo: It depends, alternative is better for OEMs, server installs, RAID. Desktop is better if you want to try first, or want to install using a graphical installer.
08:49	<Jeeves_>	!breezy?
08:49	<ubotu>	Breezy was the current stable version of Ubuntu. If you would like to upgrade to it, the guide to upgrading to Breezy is at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade
08:49	<kenni>	FunnyLookinHat, what are we doing wrong here?
08:49	<shachaf>	sally_: Yes, that's a different applet.
08:49	<conn>	hi, is it possible to rename partition numbers? e.g., rename hda7 to hda2 (providing hda2 doesn't already exist)?
08:49	<nexus10>	soundray: great!
08:49	<Jeeves_>	!dapper?
08:49	<shachaf>	sally_: Did you run nm-applet?
08:49	<ubotu>	DAPPER IS OUT! PARTY TIME! https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html
08:49	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, this is true.  Well email shipit and see if they'll sell you a bulk/discount
08:49	<rukuartic>	Raskall: Asides. Linux is free, you can't put a price on it. I think the only thing you could put on the price was hardware. Um... Anyone in here a GPL wizard?
08:49	<soundray>	nexus10: do you have DHCP?
08:49	<pianoboy3333>	What's the difference between Native and Autohinter in fontconfig?
08:49	<Booo>	dsas: how to i install from liveCD to make it permantly is this an option
08:49	<FunnyLookinHat>	kenni, not sure.  Follow the directions as carefully as possible.  I can help troubleshoot you in about 6 hours when I am home from work
08:49	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: No clue =\
08:49	<dxdemetriou>	In Breezy my ethernet is eth0. In Dapper is eth1 after upgrade. Can I change this?
08:49	<zkl-laptop>	wtf, i'm missing practically all of gnome after a fresh install
08:49	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Lol.
08:49	<nexus10>	soundray: nope, fixed IPs
08:49	<djm62>	Where is the Nelson Mandela (NRM?) footage on an upgraded install?
08:49	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: I downloaded the beta, and I've been running that for a while
08:49	<FunnyLookinHat>	Booo, there should be a desktop shortcut labeled "Install" or omething on the liveCD
08:50	<dsas>	Booo: There should be an icon on the desktop saying "install"
08:50	<rukuartic>	djm62: thats in Examples
08:50	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oh I see
08:50	<Booo>	ok thanks
08:50	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: bad bad bad
08:50	<FunnyLookinHat>	Booo, only works on the newest live CDs
08:50	<PHiSQuaRE>	grrr, I hate switching distros, I'm so damned lost now....
08:50	<PHiSQuaRE>	heh
08:50	<soundray>	nexus10: have you got all your laptops listed in /etc/hosts on the server?
08:50	<Booo>	FunnyLookinHat:?
08:50	<shachaf>	rukuartic: You could sell it for as much as you like.
08:50	<crazy_penguin>	dxdemetriou: change it in the iftab file
08:50	<sally_>	shachaf: yeah but it just gives one grey-ed out choice that says wired network
08:50	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I would've d/led it, but 1) I don't have a working CD burner, 2) I have dialup  '<
=== FunnyLookinHat is now known as FunnyHat_Work
08:50	<nexus10>	soundray: yes
08:50	<FunnyHat_Work>	Sorry guys, i have to work...  I can help you in about 6 hours when I am home
08:50	<shachaf>	rukuartic: But you have to let the person you sell it to give it away.
08:50	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Ooooooh. burn. Is your modem a software modem or a hardware modem?
08:50	<C_REATiVE_>	who installed 6.06 in oem ? plz msg me
08:50	<kenni>	FunnyLookinHat, where do you get the 8756 driver?  Are you downloading from nvidias site or something?
08:51	<shachaf>	sally_: Right click->	Enable wireless, if it's disabled?
08:51	<rukuartic>	shachaf: You sure about that? I thought it was illegal to put a price on redistributed GPL software
08:51	<Sub>	rukuartic, no itz not.
08:51	<rekrutacja>	iNiku: after restarting my computer with changed network/interfaces nothing happened: i had to start dhclient manually and networkmanager doesn't work
08:51	<serj>	someone with the lates ubuntu 6.06 please paste me a line of /etc/apt/sources.list so i can upgrade from breezy to the current
08:51	<nexus10>	soundray: fom server -- 'ssh laptop' (for example) works fine
08:51	<serj>	someone with the lates ubuntu 6.06 please paste me a line of /etc/apt/sources.list so i can upgrade from breezy to the current
08:51	<dsas>	rukuartic: Nope, you can sell it for as much as you like (go checkout redhat.com)
08:51	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: hardware modem methinks
08:51	<sally_>	shachaf: I only have "enable networking" and it's checked
08:51	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: My computer was custom made by a friend
08:51	<conn>	serj: don't do that, use update-manager
08:51	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: I hardly know anything about it Lol
08:51	<Sub>	serj, you just do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
08:51	<shachaf>	sally_: Is the wireless card working otherwise?
08:51	<dxdemetriou>	crazy_penguin: its eth0 in this file
08:51	<rukuartic>	dsas: Hahaha
08:51	<serj>	conn, which ine
08:51	<Sub>	or "gksudo "update-manager -d"
08:51	<serj>	one
08:51	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: eh... I've never had luck with linux and modems
08:52	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: It took me a whole day once to d/l a 100mb file (PSP trial)
08:52	<Simthumb>	HUH?
08:52	<sally_>	shachaf: yeah it's connected now
08:52	<Raskall>	rukuartic: I am not putting a prize on the os. I will charge about $400 for an initial install and setup of ubuntu. I will also sell SLA's including 5 hours remote maintenance pr. month for $400.
08:52	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: UH-oh
08:52	<soundray>	nexus10: I'm trying to remember... I had a similar problem ages ago... Something to do with /etc/hosts.allow... Have you read the wiki hints on NFS?
08:52	<conn>	serj: what sub said, heh
08:52	<shachaf>	sally_: Hmm.
08:52	<serj>	someone with the lates ubuntu 6.06 please paste me a line of /etc/apt/sources.list so i can upgrade from breezy to the current
08:52	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: B/c I have software to go with my dialup
08:52	<rukuartic>	Simthumb:
08:52	<shachaf>	sally_: Oh, I know.
08:52	<skippy>	hrm.   my DVD image download doesn't match the checksums.  That sucks.
08:52	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: a 3rd party dialer
08:52	<rukuartic>	serj: source-o-matic
08:52	<Simthumb>	rukuartic it uses proxies
08:52	<FunnyHat_Work>	kenni, you can get it from Synaptic.
08:52	<eggzeck>	Dapper, yay
08:52	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: O.O
08:52	<FunnyHat_Work>	<<AFK>>
08:52	<soundray>	!tell nexus10 about nfs
08:52	<shachaf>	sally_: Edit /etc/network/interfaces and comment out any lines that say anything about the interfaces.
08:53	<nexus10>	soundray: hosts.allow! great idea, will go check. And I'll go through the NFS wiki stuff again. Ta
08:53	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Ooof. Um... No clue how you'd do that in linux. I know you can do it if you havfe the right hardware, but not sure how to do it =\
08:53	<skippy>	can someone post here their checksum for the i386 Dapper dvd, please?
08:53	<eugman>	!nvidia
08:53	<ubotu>	Help about installing the nVidia drivers on Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
08:53	<shachaf>	sally_: Then restart dbus (/etc/init.d/dbus restart).
08:53	<shachaf>	sally_: It should work.
08:53	<soundray>	nexus10: cheers m8 ;)
08:53	<kenni>	FunnyHat_Work, multiverse repository or something?  (Just failed a search for it).
08:53	<dxdemetriou>	My ethernet is eth0 in iftab, but the Dapper find it as eth1. Can I change this?
08:53	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Ouch
08:53	<Raskall>	hey... dapper isn't available for any of you guys until approximately *checking remaining download time* 35 minutes.
08:53	<Raskall>	;)
08:53	<rukuartic>	What is dbus shachaf?
08:53	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: What about that thingamajig that Ubotu talked about?
08:53	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: that lets me run Win progarms on Linux?
08:54	<eugman>	Hey, is there a torrent I can use to help things?
08:54	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: It is possible, I can't remember how to do it.
08:54	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Wine? Yeah... I know. I've never tried that before.
08:54	<Booo>	how to boot liveCD to install?
08:54	<rukuartic>	eugman: Eh, I think there's something in the channel message
08:54	<dsas>	rukuartic: dbus is a inter process communication process.
08:54	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: ouch
08:54	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oh well, I'll just dive
08:54	<midna>	soundray: i'm in dapper now thanks very much...
08:54	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: Heh, good for you
08:54	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: If it doesn't work I'll boot in Windows and use that
08:54	<serj>	synaptic wont do it yo'all lamers
08:54	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Is Ubuntu easy to uninstall?
08:54	<serj>	just paste me that damn line
08:54	<soundray>	midna: :)
08:54	<rukuartic>	serj: Language.
08:54	<sally_>	shachaf, yes!  thanks a lot, that worked
08:54	<rendo>	How do you do that 3d moving of the desktop in Dapper?
08:54	<shachaf>	rukuartic: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus
08:55	<spikeh>	X is giving me an error, saying restart GDM and throwing me back to terminal but I can't type any commands
08:55	<rukuartic>	serj: Sourceomatic would be the nice to work with. juse that
08:55	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Oh I know - My dad has a USB stick I could prolly borrow to back up my stuff
08:55	<eugman>	Well, yeah rukuartic. But then I'd have to have some common sense to look up and take the initiative. That's never any fun. :)
08:55	<T-CAN>	if i am running breezy 5.10, whats the easiest way to upgrade to dapper?

08:57	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: ok :)
08:57	<FunnyHat_Work>	ubotu, tell kenni about sources
08:57	<dsas>	Simthumb: Yes, you have to enable universe in "add/remove programs" then search for it
08:57	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: thanks for all your help. You cleared a lotta stuff up :D
08:57	<eugman>	spikeh, Ctrl + Alt +F2 take you to the secondary terminal I believe.

08:59	<spikeh>	soundray: how comes when I do "startx" on the 2nd terminal, the installer script won't work?
08:59	<soundray>	rukuartic: always the modest one ;)
08:59	<sally_>	everytime dapper boots on my laptop it checks my windows partition which takes forever, how do I stop that?
08:59	<spikeh>	soundray: because the 1st terminal goes weird and won't accept any commands
08:59	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: sure will :d
08:59	<rukuartic>	soundray: no really. half my solutions are "Have you tried rebooting?" i'm still in the windows era.

08:59	<spikeh>	soundray the dapper installer
08:59	<Simthumb>	dsas: oh after I install Ubuntu?
09:00	<wastrel>	#ubuntu
09:00	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: I didn't know if it was in the repositories
09:00	<dsas>	Simthumb: Probably. I'm not sure if you can install applications while using the live cd.
09:00	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: One nice thing about Ubuntu is its really easy to install stuff. Find a linux program you like? "sudo apt-get install <program name"
09:00	<soundray>	rukuartic: rebooting is not as bad as some make it out to be.
09:00	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: cool! :D
09:00	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: It doesn't have EVERYTHING but it does have a LOT of stuff
09:01	<scifi>	vermoos: almost done , hows it going ?
09:01	<Simthumb>	Dsas: do you know if Ubuntu comes with a usermanual?
09:01	<dsas>	Simthumb: yep
09:01	<rukuartic>	Simthumb: #ubuntu and wiki.ubuntu.com
09:01	<Simthumb>	dsas: the LiveCD
09:01	<lefty_2nd>	yes you can simthumb -need to  boot as persistent and setup a partition to store it thou
09:01	<skippy>	the published MD5 sums are different for the i386-desktop at these two locations:   http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/   and   http://ftp.ussg.iu.edu/linux/ubuntu-releases/6.06/MD5SUMS
09:01	<aedwards323>	does anyone know how to get around the ubuntu-base issue?
09:01	<Simthumb>	dsas: COOL!! :D
09:01	<skippy>	which is the correct MD5?
09:01	<dsas>	Simthumb: it should be under system->help->system documentation
09:01	<PHiSQuaRE>	I would like to remove the evolution suite from my ubuntu install, when I do an apt-get remove evolution it lists ubuntu-desktop as one of the packages it is going to remove.  What is this package?  Do I need it?
09:01	<Simthumb>	o.O
09:01	<Simthumb>	O.o
09:01	<dsas>	!tell PHiSQuaRE about ubuntu-desktop
09:01	<wastrel>	ubuntu-desktop is a wrapper you don't need
09:01	<pipp0>	attention on every devices for pc is possible to find the chipset for tpm
09:01	<FunnyHat_Work>	PHiSQuaRE, you will be ok.
09:02	<FunnyHat_Work>	it's like an imaginary package...
09:02	<N3o21>	hi again... I already have linux-source, but the ./configure returns: No acceptible C compiler found in $PATH. But I have installed  gcc (4:4.0.3-1)
09:02	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig ubuntu should have Internet install
09:02	<Simthumb>	dsas: ok thanks :D
09:02	<dsas>	N3o21: Try installing build-essential
09:02	<DBO>	PHiSQuaRE, it may however effect future upgrades if new packages get added to the default install
09:02	<rukuartic>	N3o21: sudo apt-get install build-essential
09:02	<javiolo>	is safe to uninstall evolution ?
09:02	<soundray>	!tell N3o21 about b-e
09:02	<dsas>	javiolo: yeah
09:02	<wastrel>	"hella"
09:02	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig that it downloads all files straight from internet straight to install
09:02	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig if error file it download it again
09:02	<soundray>	spikeh, have you looked at the boot help screens?
09:02	<kane777>	errr. does i mess something if i changet the repositories to dapper and decided to uninstall some things before atp-get dist-upgrade??? now it's downloading quite a few packages...
09:02	<N3o21>	i can't

09:03	<N3o21>	I haven't iinternet connection in ubuntu
09:03	<DBO>	!mouse
09:03	<ubotu>	mouse is, like, Enabling extra buttons  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ManyButtonsMouseHowto or http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=65471&highlight=evdev Installing extra cursor themes can be done easily with gcursor

09:03	<JyZky>	Auckland_Pig iam burning now
09:03	<revmouse>	DBO, thx
09:03	<wastrel>	hmm i suppose i should upgrade before i try to get my junk working.
09:03	<stan>	does "Turn-key LAMP installation for this common deployment scenario" from the dapper releases notes refer to anything specific?
09:04	<kane777>	errr. does i mess something if i changet the repositories to dapper and decided to uninstall some things before atp-get dist-upgrade??? now it's downloading quite a few packages... should I stop it??
09:04	<ucordes>	hey all can anybody tell me what the "alternate" 6.06 packages are??
09:04	<ucordes>	pls
09:04	<soundray>	kane777: while it's still downloading you can safely interrupt.
09:04	<kenni>	FunnyHat_Work, we got new nvidia-glx package ...
09:04	<eugman>	stan, I THINK it MAY mean you can have a lamp server install mode from the cd. I MAY be wrong.
09:05	<DBO>	ucordes, the alternate 6.06 install CD is a traditional text based installer for ubuntu
09:05	<eugman>	ucordes, Alternate == Text installer.
09:05	<soundray>	ucordes: they are for text mode installs in case of graphics difficulties.
09:05	<vermoos>	scifi: does it look any different? do you have to restart?
09:05	<kane777>	soundray, well that's my question... should I??
09:05	<ucordes>	thanks a lot
09:05	<basvg>	hi all... just succesfully installed ubuntu dapper drake... but it seems I can't play mp3's. Which... codec / package should I install ?
09:05	<lefty_2nd>	For anyone like me who is trying to get ubuntu to run from live cd and save settings on usb drive or hdd, read this - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveCDPersistence It worked well :)
09:05	<frank_>	!mp3
09:05	<ubotu>	[mp3]  a patented format; to enable mp3 capability see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
09:05	<eugman>	basvg, lame I think but I may be wrong.
09:05	<soundray>	kane777: if you want to save on download time, you could. I personally would just let it work overnight.
09:05	<basvg>	aja, the restricted formats page
09:06	<basvg>	thanks frank_
09:06	<Fee^>	basvg: lame and gstreamer plugins that refer to them
09:06	<eugman>	Man I'm so glad I upgraded a day early.
09:06	<scifi>	vermoos: i wud suspect u wud need to restart, but im going to do a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" first
09:06	<aedwards323>	Does anyone know how to get around the ubuntu-base issue?

09:06	<emark2k>	On a ppc/Mac:  have 2 ATA and 1 SATA discs.  one of ATA drives has partition I'd like to try ubuntu on as first linux, will I be able to install the multiple linux partions on that one Mac partition, or do I have to re-partition the whole drive?
09:06	<Shutdown>	my ati graphics card is running at 640x480. I have tried installing the drivers, but I can't do it through the shell. If anyone could tell me what to do that would just make my day.
09:06	<nnz>	128 mb of ram too small for dapper live cd? coz its been booting for 5++ mins
09:06	<FunnyHat_Work>	Shutdown, don't use the shell ever!!!
09:07	<Shutdown>	sorry
09:07	<ucordes>	does anyone have experience with 6.06 and ati x700 mobility graphics?
09:07	<FunnyHat_Work>	ubotu, tell Shutdown about ati
09:07	<aedwards323>	Sub, I did a sudo update-manager -d and it said it could not locate the ubuntu-base package
09:07	<DBO>	nnz, thats a little bit tight yeah...
09:07	<Sub>	?
09:07	<FunnyHat_Work>	Shutdown, sorry, using shell w/ ubuntu is not good   ; )
09:07	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: why not use the shell?? (Just out of curiosity)
09:07	<FunnyHat_Work>	Shutdown, check the msg from ubuto
09:07	<nnz>	but it will work ?
09:07	<soundray>	nnz: yes, that's tight. It will probably boot eventually, though.
09:07	<shachaf>	Hardware acceleration works again! I had to boot the -386 kernel, rather than the -k7.
09:07	<aedwards323>	it said to report it as a bug, which I just might do
09:07	<scifi>	vermoos: wow it wants to download a further 372MB ^^
09:07	<dsas>	aedwards323: Is it currently installed?
09:07	<C_REATiVE_>	who installed 6.06 in oem ? plz msg me
09:07	<sally_>	everytime dapper boots on my laptop it checks my windows partition which takes forever, how do I stop that?
09:07	<BleedingThrough>	anyone used xubuntu yet?... any good?
09:07	<aedwards323>	ubuntu-base? lemmie see
09:07	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: yes
09:07	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, Ubuntu is designed to not sure terminal/console to make it more user friendly.  Everything can/should be done through synaptic using .deb packages from repositories
09:07	<kenni>	I run default ubuntu ... I followed wiki .. why does not X detect the nvidia 7900gt_
09:08	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: its fast
09:08	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, ever used Debian?
09:08	<aedwards323>	its not installed
09:08	<dsas>	FunnyHat_Work: Synaptic is "advanced" ;) gnome-app-install!
09:08	<soundray>	sally_: what exactly does it do in the way of "checking"?
09:08	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: No, but I see no problems with apt-get.
09:08	<johnm1019>	I hear some jive that supposedly it was going to be really easy to install XGL in dapper -- is this the case?
09:08	<FunnyHat_Work>	dsas, hah!
09:08	<BleedingThrough>	even on a crappy computer?
09:08	<dsas>	aedwards323:Try installing it first then upgrading.
09:08	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, ahh, well apt-get is just as good
09:08	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: or aptitude for that matter. since synaptic is a overlay of that
09:08	<jhenn>	johnm1019: yes apt-get install xgl
09:08	<kenni>	0000:03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation: Unknown device 0291 (rev a1)  ... kernel is : 2.6.15-23-amd64-k8
09:08	<jhenn>	johnm1019: its a trap though
09:08	<eugman>	Kenni, Have you tried doing an xserver reconfigure to see if it can detect it properly now?
09:08	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, what I meant was don't use binary installers whenever possible, use the apt-get ot get from official repos
09:09	<emark2k>	anyone familiar w/ PPC boot and partitioning?
09:09	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, right right.
09:09	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: ah, of course
09:09	<Fee^>	anyone else notice a bunch of apps gone from the program menus from Badger >	Dapper?  gconf-edit, etc?
09:09	<kenni>	eugman, no, thanx for the idea man!
09:09	<jhenn>	emark2k: ppc doesn't need a /boot partition
09:09	<johnm1019>	jhenn, what do you mean a trap :-\
09:09	<aedwards323>	it cant find it
09:09	<FunnyHat_Work>	<<AFK>>
09:09	<dsas>	Fee^: yeah, it was done purposefully
09:09	<jhenn>	johnm1019: non-free drivers
09:09	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: I thought you ment that as "Never use shell" as in, never at all :)
09:09	<scifi>	vermoos: another 55mins :P
09:09	<dsas>	aedwards323: Hmm, sorry, not sure then.
09:09	<johnm1019>	jhenn, as in they cost money or they aren't open source

09:10	<kenni>	eugman, how do you reconfigure in ubuntu?  (I tried dpkg-reconfigure)
09:10	<sally_>	soundray, it runs dosfsck, I can't find any console or file that shows exactly what it prints out
09:10	<johnm1019>	jhenn, thanks for the info! :)
09:10	<basvg>	right, that worked. only problem now is that double-clicking on mp3's will fire up the wrong app (the movie player instead of the rhythm box thingy)
09:10	<scifi>	vermoos: terminal says 54mins for me
09:10	<Fee^>	yeah, i haven't figured out how to change the file associates for mp3 yet
09:10	<Fee^>	i want xmms to be the default
09:11	<fatalblu>	i want a pony
09:11	<basvg>	Fee^: shouldn't be too hard... I'll fidle with it, hang on
09:11	<ZeromusMog>	Hello, is this the place to ask? I am not understanding how I'm supposed to setup wifi in Dapper
09:11	<basvg>	fatalblu: my little pony ;) ?
09:11	<eugman>	kenni I'm pretty sure it's dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg . May want to try dpkg-configure if that doesn't work. It's something like that.
09:11	<dsas>	Fee^: right click on an mp3
09:11	<Fee^>	since the default file types thingie seems to have been trimmed in dapper as well
09:11	<jhenn>	johnm1019: please don't give up your freedom for little effects
09:11	<ZeromusMog>	I can see it in my network configuration but i can't figure out how to scan for networks or connect to anything

09:12	<Fee^>	Dsas: yeah, i have xmms there...but i'm talking double-click action
09:12	<BleedingThrough>	6.06 much better than 5.10?

09:12	<fatalblu>	Snake: either that or invest in Chloroform
09:12	<revmouse>	BleedingThrough, yes
09:12	<ZeromusMog>	I even installed kwifi manager but it's acting very strangely
09:12	<PHiSQuaRE>	jhenn, and how much time is enough time?
09:12	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: try it geeze there is a livecd or if your on dial up shipit
09:13	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: or wait for reviews
09:13	<soundray>	sally_: that's definitely not the planned behavior. Do you mount the partition routinely in Ubuntu?
09:13	<iapx8088>	time for dapper
09:13	<PHiSQuaRE>	I can't say I'm very patient :)
09:13	<iapx8088>	let's go.
09:13	<jhenn>	PHiSQuaRE: a couple days you know

09:14	<ZeromusMog>	I'm a little dissapointed. I'm excited that the new Ubuntu can find my wireless card out of the box, and I heard it was delayed mostly for wireless support... so why isn't there a wifi manager :(
09:14	<Frem>	yaramaz, have you added the battery applet to the panel?

09:15	<kirkunit>	yaramaz: well I'm not sure about the nature of your problem, but I know that Dapper has vastly in improved power management.
09:15	<agorf>	scifi, i have artifacts on my laptop
09:15	<soundray>	sally_: fsck is run on boot if the filesystem has the dirty flag. Perhaps you can reset the dirty flag by running dosfsck -a on the filesystem from within Ubuntu.
09:15	<PHiSQuaRE>	ZeromusMog, I agree, it's quite impressive and sexilicious

09:18	<jah_raztah>	i have a bit of a problem. when ubuntu RC released a few days ago i got the server install cd and i used it to install the base system then xubuntu... now i've just downloaded the ubuntu cd and i would like to use it to to install the package ubuntu-desktop but for some reason it only will use the repositories. i disabled the repositores and added the cd to sources.list and still it doesn't recognize the cd a
09:18	<jah_raztah>	s a source to get the packages...
09:18	<yaramaz>	frem ok but battery isn't exist
09:18	<neutrinomass>	I just bought a router and an ethernet card but I can't really get them to work, can anybody offer help ?
09:18	<jtd>	I wouldn't say Breezy is "dead," exactly.
09:18	<soundray>	sally_: you're right about making that change - not sure if it'll fix the fscking, though.
09:18	<ZeromusMog>	wastrel: tries to send things but says network is down
09:18	<dsas>	ZeromusMog: try netapplet ?
09:18	<kane777>	im so exciteeeed!!
09:18	<jah_raztah>	the reason i want to use the cd rather then repository is so that it doesn't use unnessasary bandwidth
09:18	<kane777>	anybody else is??
09:18	<ZeromusMog>	there we go dsas
09:18	<jtd>	kane777: clearly you just can't hide it.
09:18	<neutrinomass>	It's probably a dhcp issue, but I'm not sure, never done this before.
09:18	<iapx8088>	bye
09:19	<Frem>	yaramaz, battery dosen't exist? Are you plugged into the wall right now?
09:19	<dsas>	ZeromusMog: Looks like nm-applet was dropped somewhere along the way. Never realised :)

09:20	<eugman>	Hey, I have nvidia-settings installed but not nvidia-glx. Should I flip those two?
09:20	<yaramaz>	the battery showing menu says "battery isn't exist and using on ac power "

09:20	<ktogias>	I see that qemu at dapper's repositories is version 0.8.0, while at qemu site vesions qemu 0.8.1 and kqemu-1.3.0pre7 are the most recent. Is the version in the repos accelerated? Should I use the dapper version, or download, compile and install the newest version from the site?
09:20	<sylvan>	hey, anyway to give myself permissions to view some of the volumes shown on the desktop? It just says I don't have permission to view it, but I can't find away to enter my password to give me permission
09:20	<mikeyyyy>	i download ubuntu and when i went to install i ti got to the first screen then, when it when i clicked install it said it couldnt read the boot disc?
09:20	<DavyO>	hello ppl
=== daki0267 is now known as daki0267-
09:20	<dsas>	ktogias: Its completly up to you, though compiling it yourself may cause problems when you update ubuntu.
09:21	<Frem>	ZeromusMog, if you want network manager, you'll need to install it & the gnome applet via apt-get, then comment out everything having to do with our wifi card in /etc/network/interfaces and reboot
09:21	<dsas>	ktogias: If you do install it from source use checkinstall
09:21	<mikeyyyy>	i download ubuntu and when i went to install i ti got to the first screen then, when it when i clicked install it said it couldnt read the boot disc?
09:21	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: maybe your burn went wrong. Run the check CD option from the boot menu.
09:21	<eugman>	sylvan, I'm assuming these are automatically mounted?
09:21	<mikeyyyy>	yea it also couldnt read it
09:21	<mikeyyyy>	so i have to re-burn it?
09:21	<Steve123>	Hi.  I upgraded from breezy to dapper ( I know, get in line).  During the upgrade process my x server configuration got messed up.  I don't know anything about x servers :).   When I rebooted I got a message telling the xserver could not be started, probably due to a configuration problem.  I would be grateful if somebody could walk me through fixing my x server config files.
09:21	<charle97>	yes
09:21	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: yes.
09:21	<sylvan>	eugman, yes
09:21	<mikeyyyy>	ok
09:21	<ZeromusMog>	Frem: but I want it to manage my wifi? I'm confused :)
09:21	<mikeyyyy>	how can i make it burn it right?
09:22	<kane777>	Details: Error reading file 'file:///usr/share/applications/nautilus-computer.desktop': File not found    What is this??? (I get this when I'm trying to run home or any of my harddisks from places menu...)
09:22	<agorf>	anyone has artifacts in OK/Cancel buttons that are gone on mouseover?
09:22	<dsas>	agorf: it's a known bug
09:22	<eugman>	sylvan, Search around for editing fstab file. There should be soemthing in the eiki.
09:22	<wastrel>	i can't see, gonna go take out my contacts
09:22	<yaramaz>	frem : did you see my last sentence?
09:22	<agorf>	dsas, so i w8 for a fix?
09:22	<charle97>	mikeyyy, do you have antivirus running while you burn?
09:22	<neutrinomass>	Steve123: I'm not sure what you have to do, I'm not familiar with X, but try 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'
09:22	<Frem>	ZeromusMog, Don't ask me why it works like that, but I had to comment out everything having to do with my wifi card in that file before it would kick in.
09:22	<mikeyyyy>	how can i burn it right?
09:22	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: don't repeat
09:22	<ktogias>	thanks dsas !
09:22	<Steve123>	thanks neutrinomass I will give it a try!

09:22	<gargamel>	squid crashes
09:22	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: it's hard to tell without knowing what went wrong. Just try again.
09:23	<mikeyyyy>	ok
09:23	<ZeromusMog>	Ah I think I see now. Otherwise it just tries to use what's there.
09:23	<Silent_al>	hello , where can i find a torrent for xubuntu?
09:23	<mikeyyyy>	i will get back to u guys later
09:23	<sylvan>	eugman, ugh... I guess linux isn't ready for prime time then..
09:23	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: I can tell. Seasoned IRC users don't say lol
09:23	<mikeyyyy>	how can u do a dual install with windows?
09:23	<dsas>	agorf: you may want to subscribe to https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-driver-ati/+bug/38198
09:23	<mikeyyyy>	:-)
09:23	<ketsugi>	soundray: wtf?
09:23	<harrison>	has anyone who was running aiglx and compiz under dapper beta noticed a slowdown in performance with the latest updates?
09:23	<ketsugi>	I've been using IRC for 10 years
09:23	<ketsugi>	and I still say lol
09:23	<ketsugi>	;(
09:23	<mikeyyyy>	:-)
09:23	<soundray>	ketsugi: wtf is another giveaway
09:23	<charle97>	mikeyy, do you know how to install windows on your own?
09:23	<ketsugi>	TEN YEARS!
09:23	<dsas>	ketsugi: You're not seasoned enough. *adds more salt*
09:23	<jah_raztah>	how do i use the dapper cd to install dapper instead of repository?
09:23	<soundray>	ketsugi: I'm only semi-serious
09:23	<agorf>	dsas, thanks!
09:23	<eugman>	Sylvan, Well I only know what I know I'm afraid. There may be an easy way but all I know is editing the fstab file which controls how the volumes are mounted.
09:24	<ketsugi>	>:(
09:24	<mikeyyyy>	did anyone see my last question?
09:24	<Silent_al>	mikeyyyy, the instasller will ask you for it, if not doin' it automatically
09:24	<jah_raztah>	i don't wish to do a fresh install
09:24	<yaramaz>	frem (: ? can you help me ? :)
09:24	<mikeyyyy>	ok cool
09:24	<mikeyyyy>	thanks
09:24	<ZeromusMog>	charle97: installing Ubuntu is easier than windows, imo.
09:24	<mikeyyyy>	so whil i am installing it, i twill ask me if i want to do a dual install?
09:24	<sylvan>	eugman, I just figured that if they show my volumes on the desktop (without asking) there should be an easy way to access them, seems like every single volume will always have this problem for all users...
09:24	<charle97>	zeromusmog, i disagree
09:24	<eugman>	Silent_al, The link in the title should have a torrent for xubuntu I think.
09:24	<sylvan>	except cdroms maybe
09:25	<MINK9Y>	hey guys, just got ubunto installed on an old xboxHDD i had left over, but now I can't get my bluetooth mouse running (logitech mx900). when I was running liveCD, I got it working by typing [sudo hidd --search]  and then pressing the mouse's connect button, but now unbutu is running from HDD it doesn't work. Any suggestions? =)
09:25	<eugman>	sylvan, ARe these ntfs volumes?
09:25	<kane777>	Details: Error reading file 'file:///usr/share/applications/nautilus-computer.desktop': File not found    What is this??? (I get this when I'm trying to run home or any of my harddisks from places menu...)
09:25	<sylvan>	eugman, yes
09:25	<Raskall>	anyone got any suggestions on how to get looking glass 3d working on an ATI card? It requires both composite and DRI, but the ati drivers disable DRI when enabling composite.
09:25	<Fee^>	dsas: i didn't find a bug there :)
09:25	<Frem>	yaramaz, I'm sorry, I don't know exactly why it says that. Does it change when you unplug it?
09:25	<Silent_al>	mikeyyyy, dual boot . yes

09:25	<ZeromusMog>	charle97: Just installing. Not confuring. In my experience more stuff works out of the box and with less hassle on Ubuntu than Windows
09:26	<jah_raztah>	i'm already on dapper but i have the beta version of xubuntu now i wish to switch to ubuntu so i downloaded the dapper cd and would now like to use that cd to install ubuntu-desktop but it will only allow me to use the repositories... how can i set it to use the cd-rom?
09:26	<mikeyyyy>	also is it easy to install a game like the linux version of americas army?
09:26	<ZeromusMog>	Problem is the few things that don't work aren't just a matter of downloading a driver installer :(
09:26	<dsas>	Fee^: It it doesn't work and it should and there's no duplicates then file one :)
09:26	<Silent_al>	eugman, got it, thankx
09:26	<kane777>	ooops... I lost synaptic... how come/??? anybody can help.... its not in the menu.... how do I get it back??? what packages should i install????
09:26	<Frem>	mikeyyyy, I've got enemy teritory installed. I didn't find it too hard. just follow the instructions on the forums.
09:26	<neutrinomass>	I just bought a router and I'm having trouble connecting to it, probably a dhcp issue. Can anybody help me ?
09:26	<harrison>	kane777 try running synaptic from the command line
09:26	<dsas>	kane777: Use alacarte menu editor
09:26	<eugman>	Sylvan, well that's the problem. Support for ntfs is rather weak. You could easily mess up something if you tried to write to such a volume. Reading them is safe but I'm guessing this might be like giving someone safety scissors so they don't cut themselves.
09:27	<ZeromusMog>	mikeyyyy: Windows is sadly king as far as games are concerned. Linux isn't really a good gaming platform unless all you play is tuxracer and quake, heh. There are some good efforts to emulate DirectX so you can play on Windows but they're not super easy to use or stable yet.
09:27	<mikeyyyy>	follow the ubuntu forums or the game forums?
09:27	<kane777>	harrison, synaptic not found... seems that i uninstalled it...
09:27	<Pilgrim->	I have a AMD Turion 64-Bit processor..should i get Ubuntu 32bit or 64bit version? Is there a big performance diference?

09:27	<harrison>	kane777 try this
09:27	<charle97>	zeromusmog: will you help me share an internet connection with windows xp if it's so easy?
09:27	<soundray>	jah_raztah: add this line add the beginning of /etc/apt/sources.list: deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.06 _Dapper Drake_ - Alpha i386 (20060329.1)] / dapper main restricted

09:27	<Frem>	neutrinomass, are you trying to install and it keeps timing out waiting for the dhcp?
09:27	<soundray>	jah_raztah: you'll have to adapt the CD name in there.
09:28	<neutrinomass>	Pilgrim-: The performance difference is small, but amd64 comes with problems :) Flash issues etc. .
09:28	<javiolo>	charle97  I you find out how to do that please let me know
09:28	<sylvan>	eugman, yeah I know I just wanted read permission.. anyway I went into fstab and changed it.. I just dislike the linux mentality where everything has to be difficult and involved
09:28	<ZeromusMog>	"internet connection sharing" is in the "configure" department ;)

09:29	<jah_raztah>	soundray, finally some one responds and yes i've done that already... i'm not a newbie... but this makes no sens ei added the cd to the repositories already using synaptic and the method u stated earlier and neither worked... when i goto look for packages ubuntu-desktop it says not found

09:30	<charle97>	javiolo: i used the same setup, but i wanted the ubuntu machine to share with xp instead.... never could get that working
09:30	<kane777>	harrison, thanx pal... i accidentaly uninstalled it... and knew not what to do... and few other problems occured... eg when i sellect home or any of my disks in places menu i get error... do you know what it might be??

09:31	<T-CAN>	k
09:31	<harrison>	kane777 >	i am not sure, but it sounds like you may have boogered it up pretty bad, if you have just installed, i would suggest installing again
09:31	<profoX`>	Is the live cd really really slow or is it my cd drive, and if it is my cd drive, multitasking seems to be bad under heavy disk load, can some HD resources be saved for multitasking ?
09:32	<Ratzilla>	im almost done upgrading :)
09:32	<eugman>	T-CAN, You can do it early by typing sudo update-manager -d into the terminal.

09:33	<eugman>	Dapper, nvidia, working, anyone?
09:33	<wastrel>	profoX`:  minimal is slow :]   the livecd is loading the filesystem into RAM, so you won't have as much left over for running processes.
09:33	<profoX`>	wastrel: anyway... i think its mainly due to the disc load time...
09:33	<ScreaminIke>	where is the live cd?
09:33	<maddler>	eugman: me... but using drivers downloaded from nvidia...
09:33	<soundray>	ScreaminIke: it is now called Desktop CD
09:33	<profoX`>	ScreaminIke: the live cd got merged with the install cd in 6.06 I think
09:34	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, it worked for me in beta, testing tonight when I get home
09:34	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: Didn't work . Bringing up eth0 also clobbers up my ppp0 interface.

09:34	<eugman>	FunnyHat_Work, Do you have nvidia-glx installed?
09:34	<dsas>	!tell ktogias about xgl
09:34	<mikeyyyy>	yea i was confused by them calling it desktop cd too, they might want to add a note on the website or something
09:34	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, it should... but no guaruntees
09:34	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, yea.  and all of it's dependencies of course
09:34	<stjepan>	anyone tried dapper?
09:35	<indro>	!tell indro about xgl

09:35	<stjepan>	dsas, "most" ???
09:35	<profoX`>	wastrel: I have been waiting for more than 10 minutes now to get "set time" to open.. still not opened.. cpu usage itself isnt high, but the disk load is just 100% .. its just way too slow

09:35	<yaramaz>	how  do  i compile the kernel on ubuntu 5.10?
09:35	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: When I bring ppp0 up though, I can ping 192.168.1.1 and 0.1, although this is probably irrelevant.
09:35	<eugman>	FunnyHat_Work, And I'm guessing I'm not supposed to have nvidia-settings anymore?
09:35	<shachaf>	rendo: Yes, there is. Do you mean on boot or on login?
09:35	<soundray>	jah_raztah: when you mount the CD, can you find the package? 'find /media/cdrom0 -name ubuntu-desktop\*.deb'
09:35	<rendo>	Login
09:35	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, yea, I don't think you need that one
09:35	<profoX`>	ltR20: yes it did 6.06 got released today
09:35	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ hum... the cd-iso of debian-31r0a amd64 dont detect my raid1.
09:35	<wastrel>	profoX`:  yeah i dunno - get more ram :]   i don't really use the livecd
09:35	<eXistenZ>	Would anyone recommend me a practical md5 hash generator?
09:35	<FunnyHat_Work>	ubotu, tell eugman about nvidia
09:35	<dsas>	rendo: Yep you need to put the script in /etc/rc3.d and call it S99yourscriptname
09:35	<ScreaminIke>	what's the difference between that and the desktop?
09:35	<Tocano>	Where are the network configuration files in Ubuntu?  We had a DHCP failure during install, so figured we'd set that up after install ... but don't know where those files are in this one (6.06 LTS)
09:35	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, just follow that wiki for dapper instructions
09:35	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, I'm sorry, then. I don't know.
09:35	<mikeyyyy>	ok 20 minutes to download now 20 to burn lol grrrrrrr
09:35	<rendo>	Thank you.
09:36	<profoX`>	wastrel: im going to install it on a 512 machine, its for a friend of me :)
09:36	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, try the i386 cd.
09:36	<kane777>	harrison, ok found the source of this messup... i uninstalled gnome... LOL...
09:36	<soundray>	ScreaminIke: it has a text-based installer
09:36	<ScreaminIke>	ahe
09:36	<shachaf>	rendo: No, wait.
09:36	<foodcoman>	Anyone know why I get this error on my laptop CDROM.  Trying to enable DMA. http://kubuntu.pastebin.com/751965
09:36	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, all x64 software is fairly buggy still in the GNU/Linux world
09:36	<rendo>	Eh?
09:36	<dsas>	eXistenZ: md5sum
09:36	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: Ok, thanks. But normally it should be a matter of just activating eth0 and connecting to 192.168.0.1, right?
09:36	<dsas>	eXistenZ: It's there by default.
09:36	<shachaf>	rendo: What dsas said will run the script on boot.
09:36	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ i386 work. i have installed debian i386 with kernel 2.6.
09:36	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, yes, it should be. that or 192.168.1.1
09:36	<rendo>	Okay, then how do I do it on login? :)
09:36	<mikeyyyy>	i thikn ubuntu has the best customer support
09:37	<profoX`>	wastrel: i use archlinux right now myself, but i must admit that ubuntu is coming along pretty well lately, im already looking forward to 6.10
09:37	<soundray>	jah_raztah: have you done an md5sum on the CD btw?
09:37	<ZeromusDesktop>	Well, damn. Network Manager doesn't like to connect either. And still nothing that just scans =\
09:37	<shachaf>	rendo: To run in on login, either put it in your .Xsession or (if you're running GNOME) go to System->Preferences->Sessions->Startup Programs and add it there.
09:37	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, then it's the 64bit packages that are failing on you, rather than the total support for RAID.
09:37	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, oh, just remembered. have you tried setting that ip address as your gateway?
09:37	<T-CAN>	profoX` how do you like archlinux?
09:37	<rendo>	I did that shachaf, and the script didn't run. :(
09:37	<FunnyHat_Work>	<<AFK AGAIN>>
09:37	<rendo>	In the session startup thing.
09:37	<redmonkey>	hi. i cannot play dvd movies. what libraries do i need for it except libdvdc**?
09:37	<shachaf>	rendo: You're sure?
09:37	<Trashcan>	my video card burned out, and i need to get my dapper box to a state where i can run sshd
09:37	<jah_raztah>	soundray, no i have not i download the the official torrent file from ubuntu website and once it finished downloading i burnt it
09:37	<rendo>	Yes.
09:37	<skeltoac>	just installed update from breezy badger to dapper... gotta reboot! :)
09:37	<Trashcan>	is there a quick keystroke to get it to boot to console
09:38	<shachaf>	rendo: You might have to type the full path in, rather than just the name of the script.
09:38	<dsas>	redmonkey: Have you saw http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats ?
09:38	<ltR20>	did drapper come out yet - final version.
09:38	<rendo>	I did that.
09:38	<dsas>	ltR20: yes
09:38	<Trashcan>	im driving with my eyes closed so no X
09:38	<ltR20>	Can i order the cds?
09:38	<Annie>	hey
09:38	<jah_raztah>	soundray you are right there is no package named ubuntu-desktop on the cdrom as well
09:38	<dsas>	ltR20: yes, they won't arrive for 4-6 weeks though
09:38	<Annie>	asl
09:38	<iNiku>	Trashcan: sshd can run even if X is running
09:38	<dsas>	ltR20: Maybe even longer
09:38	<eXistenZ>	dsas, Say I want to generate a md5 hash from a text, is it possible to do that with md5sum?
09:38	<redmonkey>	dsas: no, thank you for the link!
09:38	<iNiku>	Trashcan: you might not have sshd installed, though
09:38	<Trashcan>	i do
09:38	<Trashcan>	it's not set up to run at boot
09:38	<Trashcan>	hence the problem
09:38	<Trashcan>	so i need to jump to a console and run it
09:39	<dsas>	eXistenZ: just do "md5sum filename"
09:39	<Trashcan>	but have to do so without being able to see
09:39	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: 192.168.0.1 or the 169.xxx addy? how do I set it as a gateway with dhcp ?
09:39	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ hum... what do you recommend? leave with i386 2.6?
09:39	<harrison>	anyone running compiz + aiglx with dapper release?
09:39	<T-CAN>	im off to upgrade to dapper
09:39	<T-CAN>	wish me luck
09:39	<profoX`>	T-CAN: best distribution i ever had... its abit harder to setup/configure, but once its running it works flawlessly, and you have so many options. pacman package manager look salot like apt-get and ABS is like gentoo's build system.
09:39	<eXistenZ>	dsas, the text is not in a file
09:39	<dsas>	harrison: see #ubuntu-xgl
09:39	<aedwards323>	how do you upgrade to dapper from command line
09:39	<aedwards323>	?????
09:39	<harrison>	thx
09:39	<dsas>	eXistenZ: Where is it?
09:39	<CHodapp>	Ok. Before someone else uses it offensively, I'll just scream it: JEWBUNTU
09:39	<bingo>	Hi, I try dapper today, it's very nice... do you know the name of the gtk theme of dapper? cause I want the same in my debian !
09:39	<shachaf>	rendo: Hmm.
09:39	<CHodapp>	There. Now it's dead.
09:39	<iNiku>	Trashcan: oh... ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a console, then log in and run sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
09:39	<nnz>	dapper wont boot on 128 megs of ram , after nautils done loading it just goes to blank screen n nothing.do server dapper have gui?
09:39	<Hoxzer>	How well does ubuntu support NTFS writing?
09:39	<dsas>	bingo: Human
09:39	<eXistenZ>	dsas, I just want to feed it a text, and it will convert it into md5 hash
09:39	<dsas>	Hoxzer: It doesn't
09:39	<T-CAN>	profoX` I really want to try archlinux out but I dont know if i can handle it
09:39	<iNiku>	Trashcan: sudo will probably ask for your password
09:40	<Hoxzer>	LOLLERSKATES
09:40	<shachaf>	rendo: Does the script work when you run it normally?
09:40	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ is the first time i play with 64bits arch.
09:40	<profoX`>	T-CAN: do you have experience with linux ?
09:40	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, well if it isn't broken, don't fix it  ; )
09:40	<rendo>	ya
09:40	<Trashcan>	iniku: can i ctl-alt-f1 from x login screen?
09:40	<Hoxzer>	is there any way to enable it?
09:40	<neutrinomas1>	nnz: No, but the desktop should boot at least I think. It would be slow as hell, but bootable ...
09:40	<jah_raztah>	soundray, should i just forget about using the cd-rom and just use the repositories to install the packages?
09:40	<bingo>	dsas, do you know wher I can download it
09:40	<T-CAN>	a little but not much
09:40	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, I'd stay away from the 64bit kernels , etc. for now
09:40	<shachaf>	rendo: Try adding some other program to the list and see if it starts on login.
09:40	<dsas>	eXistenZ: just type md5sum, then start writing, press ctrl+D when you've finished
09:40	<iNiku>	Trashcan: yes
09:40	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, the 192.168.0.1 address. I don't remeber exactly how to set something as a gateway, but I had to do it many moons ago with slackware. it's something like ifconfig -gateway 192.168.0.1, but don't quote me on that.
09:40	<rendo>	I have to run it in the terminal though.
09:40	<Trashcan>	awesome thanks
09:40	<MagusG>	is there any word on when a DVD release will be up?
09:40	<nnz>	nope its not , just tried that
09:40	<dsas>	bingo: http://ubuntu.com/download
09:40	<T-CAN>	profoX` I just started with it acouple weeks ago
09:40	<rendo>	Gaim does already, so it works. I dunno why the script won't :/
09:40	<ZeromusDesktop>	You know guys, I DO live in pretty close to Broadcom's offices, maybe I should go there and raise hell :)
09:40	<eugman>	http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/ . Check it out.  It's a useful sorce of information.
09:40	<profoX`>	T-CAN: the #archlinux channel is friendly; but for beginners i wouldnt advise arch. why do you want to try out arch ?
09:40	<aedwards323>	!upgrade
09:40	<ubotu>	from memory, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy ->	http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper ->	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo "update-manager -d" always updates to the bleeding edge.
09:41	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ hum...
09:41	<ZeromusDesktop>	For all of you out there cursing out your wifi cards ;D
09:41	<soundray>	jah_raztah: depends... if you're paying per MB, I would check the md5sums first (on the image file AND on the CD)
09:41	<T-CAN>	profoX` I really just want to learn what makes it tick and Ive heard that building the system yourself helps you understand a lot about it
09:41	<bingo>	dsas, thank you but I just want the gtk theme :-D
09:41	<ZeromusDesktop>	There are lots of nerds down here maybe we should gather together with giant signs saying "RELEASE LINUX DRIVERS FOR YOUR HARDWARE"
09:41	<jah_raztah>	ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
09:41	<jah_raztah>	that is what i downloaded
09:41	<bingo>	dsas, I have already download dapper
09:41	<asdx>	does dapper has wifi enhancements?
09:41	<jhollon>	Hey, when I try upgrade from breezy to dapper i get an error while downloading the files:  Failed to fetch http://kubuntu.org/packages/latest/.........../Packages.gz and Sources.gz.  404 Not Found.  Why cant i see those files?
09:41	<jah_raztah>	how do i do a md5sum check
09:41	<sloof3|ubuntu>	What's the harm in removing the ubuntu-desktop package?
09:42	<asdx>	does dapper has wifi enhancements?
09:42	<dsas>	bingo: you want the files ?
09:42	<ZeromusDesktop>	asdx, not as many as I hoped there would be :(
09:42	<sloof3|ubuntu>	jah_raztah: md5sum
09:42	<mgalvin>	wow, 1000+ people... hello world!
09:42	<soundray>	jah_raztah: if you're only concerned about your impact on the web, I think you can safely assume it's okay to download a gig or so.
09:42	<asdx>	bah
09:42	<profoX`>	T-CAN: then maybe gentoo would be good for you, but it is too time consuming and even harder to setup. you have to compile everything from source, and frankly, it isnt that much faster than archlinux (the same kinda) plus in the end you just use portage to compile packages.. that wont teach you anything either
09:42	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: No luck with that :( Thanks anyway, I'll just lurk in here until somebody helps me :)
09:42	<dsas>	!tell sloof3|ubuntu about ubuntu-desktop
09:42	<ZeromusDesktop>	It seems to have better card support but no sort of wifi manager :(
09:42	<rackerz>	Do you guys recommend I install all the things automatix's installs manually?
=== epinefrin is now known as epinephrine
09:42	<vermoos>	scifi: ok! it needed a restart, and gives a good first impression. its a nicer look and feel for defo, and matplotlib is in the package manager by default.
09:42	<soundray>	rackerz: don't use automatix!
09:42	<iNiku>	Trashcan: how did your video card "burn out", though?
09:42	<soundray>	!automatix
09:42	<dsas>	rackerz: Don't do automatix
09:42	<ubotu>	well, automatix is unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
09:42	<RandolphCarter>	rackerz: you can do it yourself then save your history as a script
09:42	<ZeromusDesktop>	profoX`, you DO learn a lot from Gentoo. Not how to compile packages though, heh
09:42	<jah_raztah>	no it's only around 303 mb that i need to download since i have all the xorg and other gtk2 libs and things from xubuntu already
09:42	<eugman>	Rackerz, yes mainly because it'll be easily revertable and because you'll be smarter for it.
09:42	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, ok. good luck with that. :-)
09:42	<dsas>	!tell rackerz about easyubuntu
09:42	<bingo>	dsas, yes I want the gtk theme to add it on debian gnome
09:43	<profoX`>	T-CAN: if you are serious about learning linux i would START with a distro like ubuntu, and later you can try Archlinux. you will learn alot with arch.
09:43	<scifi>	vermoos: kewl, still got 20mins or os of downloading left
09:43	<ZeromusDesktop>	!tell ZeromusDesktop about easyubuntu
09:43	<scifi>	so*
09:43	<rackerz>	dsas: easyubuntu breaks totem for me :(
09:43	<shammy>	how's the wireless compatability on drake?
09:43	<T-CAN>	profoX` I figure the only way to really figure everything out is by jumping in head first. Plus I am on a computer that I just threw together and dont really care about so it would be that big of a deal if anything got messed up.
09:43	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ if ubuntu detect all of my hardwares? is better i leave with i386 2.6?
09:43	<soundray>	rackerz: just tell easyubuntu to leave your totem alone.
09:43	<Mellar>	after upgradeing to dapper. apt-get update gives me theese messages: http://no.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz  407 Proxy Authentication Required
09:44	<vermoos>	scifi: it'll be worth it if matplotlib installs alove - its broken under breezy
09:44	<sloof3|ubuntu>	dsas: When ubuto says upgrade does it mean between releases?
09:44	<Mellar>	I also have no longer sound
09:44	<mikeyyyy>	why i subuntu a lot better then windows?
09:44	<profoX`>	T-CAN: sure, but beginners will enjoy ubuntu better i think :) although my first real distribution was debian too, when it still had the bad/uneasy installer
09:44	<Andy101>	is there anyway of removing an applet from a panel without actually starting gnome, the gxmms applet keeps causing gnome to crash when starting so I want to remove it
09:44	<profoX`>	T-CAN: and i liked it
09:44	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: who said that?
09:44	<scifi>	vermoos: whats matplotlib ?
09:44	<T-CAN>	profoX` ya, I am on ubuntu right now and I have learned a lot but I feel I could learn so much more by using arch
09:44	<brandon_>	did that bug with the volume controls in gnome being reversed get fixed yet? i updated today and it's still there
09:44	<profoX`>	T-CAN: well, what do you want to learn. you want to learn how your system works ?
09:44	<T-CAN>	profoX` pretty much
09:45	<vermoos>	scifi: its a great python-based plotting package, just about the best for producing great looking graphs and stuff
09:45	<dsas>	bingo: it's in /usr/share/themes/Human/
09:45	<arcade>	Heh, Ubuntu is one of the better distros I've used.. only a few flaws.. (defaults to UTF-8 (blrhg!), not a proper build environment by default, and Ubuntu is Yet Another Distro that hasn't figured out a good way to distribute Good Updates for old releases :)
09:45	<tekNerd>	I installed ubuntu on Virtual PC but I can-t make the metwork to work! Heeeeeeeelp!
09:45	<dsas>	! tell rackerz about mp3
09:45	<ubotu>	dsas: NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
09:45	<profoX`>	btw! enough! i am going to reboot that fcking laptop. it is just crashing the live cd !! slow as hell and ive been waiting for 30 minutes for the "configure time" to open and it just keeps loading the disc. enough ;) is there  a text install included in the Desktop CD ?
09:45	<neutrinomas1>	Can anybody help me with a networking issue? (1 router, 1 computer, probably a dhcp issue ...) Netgear router ..
09:45	<dsas>	!tell rackerz about mp3
09:45	<Anon3878>	hey hey hey.  quick question about upgrading to dapper from breezy.  what is the best method and do i need to backup my home directory using the said method
09:45	<zcat[1] >	is there much point removing bluez and pcmcia from this machine (it's a desktop, no pcmcia or bluetooth)
09:45	<dsas>	rackerz: That should cover most of what easyubuntu does the 'manual' way
09:45	<arcade>	neutrinomas1: shoot.
09:45	<scifi>	vermoos: im only into 3D graphics, looking forward to using latest version of Blender that comes with dapper
09:45	<soundray>	arcade: it's so easy to upgrade to a new release -- why bother with old ones.
09:46	<bingo>	dsas, it's true ! I my debian will look like ubuntu ! thank you
09:46	<mikeyyyy>	will ubuntu work on a lan with windows xp macines?
09:46	<rackerz>	thanks dsas :)
09:46	<malv>	anyone having usb printer problems?
09:46	<dsas>	sloof3|ubuntu: yeah
09:46	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: sharing files and printers? Yes.
09:46	<dsas>	mikeyyyyy: yes
09:46	<charle97>	mikeyyy: you're messing with us
09:46	<vermoos>	scifi: do you know how to draw a Penrose tile? its tricky.
09:46	<Ratzilla>	does distro upgrading and clean installing a new distro have any differences?
09:46	<mikeyyyy>	well i just meant will the normal internet work
09:46	<Anon3878>	mikeyyyy yes
09:46	<zcat[1] >	mikeyyyy: transparently... you can browse the windows network, right-click to share folders, etc...
=== [1] wenko[Lappy]  is now known as wenko[Lappy] 
09:46	<malv>	clean install is best
09:46	<eugman>	profofx, alternate cd has text install. May want to check cd for integrity.
09:46	<scifi>	vermoos: no idea lol
09:46	<tekNerd>	I installed ubuntu on Virtual PC but I can-t make the metwork to work! Heeeeeeeelp!
09:46	<malv>	updates tend to break things
09:46	<profoX`>	T-CAN: well arch will learn you about how linux works better than most distros, because you have to edit alot of files by hand, configuration files that tell your system what to do and where to look
09:47	<dsas>	malv: It's fine as long as you have the ubuntu-* metapackages installed
09:47	<arcade>	soundray: New releases doesn't come every week ;)  I'm thinking in the way of.. an _official_ way to upgrade - without any conflicts - the kernel to the newest release, KDE to the newest release, and so forth.  Those things should be made readily available for the pervious 'stable' releases.
09:47	<pandamonium>	is there a way to set a global http proxy? i keep getting "can't resolve http" errors and nothing will update/download. my isp insists on using transparent proxies but the default one i go through is broken :(
09:47	<profoX`>	T-CAN: i havent tried gentoo MYSELF but thats because i hate the compiling-compiling-compiling :) and arch has speed optimizations by default in the packages for i686
09:47	<malv>	my wireless card was broken until I reinstalled dapper
09:47	<neutrinomas1>	arcade: Thanks. I will share a dsl line in a while, so I bought a router and one ethernet card to try things out first. I installed the ethernet card, connected it to the router; this part is probably OK since all leds on the router light up as expected. When bringing up eth0 ('ifup eth0') I get errors(?) like DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 15.I then try to connect to the web interface at 192.168.0.1, and I can't 
09:47	<michaels>	my mouse's scrollwheel makes firefox go back and forewards.
09:47	<Marticus>	bah
09:47	<profoX`>	michaels: known bug
09:47	<neutrinomas1>	michaels: Known bug, check Malone
09:47	<Marticus>	no expert mode in dapper install?
09:48	<profoX`>	michaels: think you have to remap your buttons
09:48	<davmor2>	tekNerd: What virtual pc software did you use
09:48	<arcade>	neutrinomas1: Uhm, DHCPDISCOVER is not an error message :D
09:48	<dsas>	Marticus: There is if you use the alternative cd
09:48	<T-CAN>	profoX` ya, maybe I will just stick around with ubuntu for awhile and see if I feel I know enough about linux in general to switch to arch
09:48	<Marticus>	indeed
09:48	<Andy101>	anyone know how to remove an applet from a panel in gnome from the command line, is there a file I can edit?
09:48	<wastrel>	isn't that a preference in firefox?
09:48	<shadow_mil>	Where is the startup script?
09:48	<mikeyyyy>	sorry for all the weird questions, i am new to ubuntu
09:48	<soundray>	arcade: but... they *are*. I never had much trouble upgrading, either within-release or release-to-release.
09:48	<Blake7984>	anyone in here happen to have experience with sata raid in ubuntu?
09:48	<tekNerd>	Microsoft's 2004
09:48	<pandamonium>	michaels, there's a way to configure that in firefox
09:48	<ZeromusDesktop>	Blake7984, it just works
09:48	<Marticus>	dsas: much appreciated
09:48	<michaels>	how pandamonium?
09:48	<ZeromusDesktop>	unlike other certain OSes
09:48	<profoX`>	Is there a way to do a text install with the Desktop CD ?
09:48	<arcade>	soundray: I had to compile my 2.6.14 kernel myself. :)
09:48	<Blake7984>	ZeromusDesktop its not for me...its detecting my mirrored array as 2 seperate drives
09:48	<mikeyyyy>	do all firefox exstensions work and install normaly ?
09:48	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomas1: What router ? I take it you enabled the dhcp server
09:48	<pandamonium>	you type something into the address bar to get a whole load of settings. let me look it up
=== X3n0n is now known as X3n0n_iMac
09:49	<davmor2>	tekNerd: Sorry then no idea on how you force the issue with windows.
09:49	<shadow_mil>	?
09:49	<neutrinomas1>	arcade: Quite possibly, I'm not sure (first time doing this). Any idea on what might be going wrong? eth0 gets assigned an 169.xx address, which according to the manual "is assigned by windows when an address cannot be obtained by dhcp'
09:49	<soundray>	arcade: I never needed one.
09:49	<arcade>	soundray: Wasn't any released for breezy when I needed it, if I remember correctly.
09:49	<wastrel>	about:config
09:49	<ZeromusDesktop>	Ah, I haven't used anything but Raid 0 so unfortunately I can't help you :(

09:49	<osotogari>	Hey all, if i upgrade to Dapper, all my settings with remain the same per user?
09:49	<dar>	ubuntu-fr
09:49	<neutrinomas1>	h3sp4wn: Netgear router. I need a server on my box? (I thought the dhcp server part was handled by the router)
09:49	<siofwolves_>	has 6.06 got WPA-PSK in the network manager ?
09:49	<arcade>	soundray: Wasn't that big an issue .. but it shouldn't b an issue at all.
09:49	<aedwards323>	!upgrade
09:49	<MINK9Y>	just HDD installed ubuntu, neither network/internet nor BT mouse work now (both worked fine from LiveCD). Is there some sort of setup util I've missed/skipped??
09:49	<zcat[1] >	osotogari: shjould do
09:49	<arcade>	soundray: The biggest issue was figuring out what things I needed to get a build environment set up
09:49	<jenda>	I need help with gnome-panel. It always jumps to the top part of the screen from the bottom when in use. It's set to autohide and semi-transparent. No special action seems to be necessary (perhaps mouse-over)
09:49	<vermoos>	scifi: the windows have a xp feel, but overall i'm impressed.
09:49	<soundray>	arcade: now I'm starting to see what you mean.
09:49	<osotogari>	excellent! Im off to upgrade so \o/
09:49	<Blake7984>	ZeromusDesktop its hardware raid though....why would it detect it as 2 seperate 250gb drives rather than just a single one?
09:49	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomas1: No I meant on the router
09:49	<michaels>	pandamonium: about:config?
09:49	<profoX`>	i am so pissed at the desktop installer :/
09:50	<neutrinomas1>	h3sp4wn: No, I can't even connect to it.
09:50	<soundray>	arcade: I guess being bleeding edge is just not in the mission statement.
09:50	<McNutella>	upgradede to dapper and all my settings were banished, including my firefox which has been reset.. how lame is that!
09:50	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomas1: Netgears default to 192.168.1.1 (in my experience until configured)
09:50	<arcade>	neutrinomas1: True.  That means the router isn't giving you a dhcp address, and then you of course cannot connect to 192.168.0.1
09:50	<wastrel>	pandamonium:  about:config and then scroll down to the mousewheel section...  i forget which exactly they are tho
09:50	<defunkt>	the power manager on dapper doesn't work apparently :(
=== neutrinomas1 is now known as neutrinomass
09:50	<aedwards323>	!up-fucking-grade
09:50	<ubotu>	aedwards323: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
09:50	<zcat[1] >	I did a clean install to dapper, then copied over just the dotfiles I really wanted to keep, firefox and tbird settings, etc... worked very well for me.
09:50	<aedwards323>	!upgrade
09:50	<nnz>	what does lvm stand for?
09:50	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomas1: Try setting a static ip just until it is configured
09:50	<ZeromusDesktop>	Blake7984, I wish I knew D:
09:50	<scifi>	vermoos: yeh i heard how much slicker the lastest gnome is,, all ur apps work ok? firefox etc
09:50	<defunkt>	nnz large volume management
09:50	<neutrinomass>	h3sp4wn: How do I do that ? :(
09:50	<jorgp>	is there a package diff list for ubuntu desktop vs ubuntu server iso?
09:50	<Blake7984>	ZeromusDesktop what raid controller do you use?
09:50	<arcade>	neutrinomas1: How does the manual tell you to connect to the router?  You might try to do an "ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.3 netmask 255.255.255.0" and then try to connect.
09:50	<aedwards323>	!dapper
09:50	<ubotu>	DAPPER IS OUT! PARTY TIME! https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2006-June/000083.html
09:50	<soundray>	nnz: logical volume management. Stay away from it if you can.
09:50	<zcat[1] >	If you just upgrade all your settings should migrate to the newer versions fairly cleanly.
09:51	<nnz>	k thnx
09:51	<defunkt>	err yeah, logical, not large
09:51	<defunkt>	duh
09:51	<Mellar>	after upgradeing to dapper. apt-get update gives me theese messages: http://no.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz  407 Proxy Authentication Required
09:51	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomass: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.2
09:51	<vermoos>	scifi: everythings sweet, and i have stuff i didn't have previously :)
09:51	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomass: then try ping 192.168.1.1
09:51	<neutrinomass>	arcade: Um.. just connect cables and do http://192.168.0.1 (it's just windows instructions )
09:51	<arcade>	soundray: I know being bleeding edge is not in the mission statement, but it's a hassle when you need support for your new raid controller.
09:51	<profoX`>	anyway
09:51	<soundray>	defunkt: I forgive you :)
09:51	<profoX`>	I see Ubuntu getting big :)
09:51	<arcade>	neutrinomass: Okay.  Then try the ifconfig statement.
09:51	<nigel>	hey guys, how do I get ubuntu to update itself to dapper?  the update manager isn't finding anything.
09:51	<neutrinomass>	h3sp4wn: Ok. Btw, why does ppp0 become inactive when I bring up eth0 ?
09:51	<scifi>	vermoos:  sweet :)
09:51	<mikeyyyy>	are there anythign for ubuntu like yahoo wigets?
09:51	<michaels>	pandamonium, profoX`, is this an ubuntu bug or a firefox one?
09:52	<FunnyHat_Work>	mikeyyyy, yea it's called gDesklets
09:52	<arcade>	neutrinomass: Probably because some default route thing. :)
09:52	<arcade>	neutrinomass: Depends on the dhcp-client, I guess.
09:52	<mikeyyyy>	cool
09:52	<MagusG>	what all is included on the ubuntu dvd?
09:52	<zcat[1] >	arcade: seriously, hardware raid sucks; it ties your array to a single controller. Software raid has minimal overhead and huge advantages.
09:52	<mikeyyyy>	thanks
09:52	<Pilgrim->	thank you neutrinomass :)
09:52	<soundray>	arcade: yes it is... But then, you're supposed to buy a computer for your OS, not vice versa.
09:52	<arcade>	zcat[1] : Uhm, Why are you telling me this?
09:52	<MINK9Y>	anyone know of a Dapper Release Party in Copenhagen? =)
09:52	<neutrinomass>	Ok, brb to try the ifconfig thing ...
09:52	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomass: That would only usually happen if you have two default routes (the dhcp will provide a default route which will replece the one which is thru ppp0
09:52	<pandamonium>	michaels, yes, about:config
09:52	<arcade>	soundray: Heh, sometimes you need a certain piece of hardware.
09:52	<pandamonium>	but don't know about the bug
09:53	<trappist>	zcat[1] : software raid has administrative overhead
09:53	<spikeh>	can someone please explain why when I change the screen resolution, it kicks me back to the login screen?
09:53	<pianoboy3333>	Can I swear somewhat/
09:53	<michaels>	pandamonium: any idea what to do in about:config?
09:53	<MINK9Y>	anyone got ideas on how I can get my internet working in Dapper? Worked fine from LiveCD but now I installed it's gone...
09:53	<dmbt>	spikeh: thats bad
09:53	<georgegay>	hi, i was introduced to linex about an hour ago, and i wanna connect to the net (this is windows), how the hell do i do it, its too hard
09:53	<steve123>	Hi;
09:53	<Fee^>	dsas: i figured it out, i was using the context-menu open-with earlier...not the right-click/open with to change the setting..  fixed :)
09:53	<steve123>	I just upgraded from breezy ->	dapper.
09:53	<steve123>	All went well until I rebooted. The system told me that the xserver wouldn't start and this was most likely due to a poor configuration. I know nothing about xservers .
09:53	<steve123>	I tried
09:53	<steve123>	dpkg --configure xserver-org
09:53	<steve123>	but it told me that it was already configured and did nothing. There was no "--reconfigure" option.
09:53	<steve123>	Any help getting through this would be appreciated.
09:53	<h3sp4wn>	neutrinomass: If it is on 192.168.0.1 then set the address to 192.168.0.2
09:53	<steve123>	Thanks
09:53	<pianoboy3333>	Like f**k s**t
09:53	<dmbt>	spikeh: that probably means x.org crashed
09:53	<pianoboy3333>	I need major serious help
09:53	<pianoboy3333>	please?
09:53	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, whats up
09:53	<arcade>	zcat[1] : I needed to get my SATA controller supported, so that I could connect my disks, and run software raid over it.  I'm not using hardware raid. ;)
09:53	<soundray>	arcade: I'd continue to talk back, but we're getting offtopic...
09:53	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, i have a few minutes
09:53	<spikeh>	dmbt yes I've been having trouble with xserver
09:53	<profoX`>	going to try ubuntu on this pc now.. it has 512 MB and is a desktop pc instead of laptop
09:54	<zcat[1] >	spikeh: you know most 'hardware' raid controllers just do software raid using their own propriatory driver anyhow, right?
09:54	<erUSUL>	!tell pianoboy3333 about ask
09:54	<pianoboy3333>	FunnyHat_Work: ok... well, I tried to install fedora on an external drive...

=== profoXLap is now known as profoXP
09:54	<arcade>	soundray: Well, I'm just saying what I find to be the flaws of ubuntu, and almost every linux distro except gentoo which is a pain ;)
09:54	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, there's your problem  ; )
09:54	<pianoboy3333>	erUSUL: I don't really care for ubotu right now
09:54	<pianoboy3333>	FunnyHat_Work: no...
09:54	<georgegay>	hi, i was introduced to linex about an hour ago, and i wanna connect to the net (this is windows), how the hell do i do it, its too hard
09:54	<AnAnt>	if I am going to get a new version of linux kernel as a tarball, is there a special way to compile it under Ubuntu ? sort of helping packages or so ?
09:54	<Krpano>	what is the command to config the xorg.conf from the terminal ?
09:54	<spikeh>	dmbt: thing is, somehow Xserver has started but in the highest resolution
09:54	<pianoboy3333>	FunnyHat_Work: and now ubuntu won't boot, I'm on a xubuntu desktop cd right now... normally I use ubuntu though
09:54	<MikeW>	Is there a hardware compatability list for XGL on Dapper?
09:54	<zcat[1] >	arcade: fair enough. Yes, I have a fair amount of unsupported hardware here too. It sucks.
09:54	<nigel>	can someone tell me how to upgrade to dapper?  the update manager doesn't seem to find anything new.
09:54	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, more than likely your bootload was fscked.
09:55	<franzp>	hi.........anyone with the ppc version ?
09:55	<trappist>	!tell nigel about upgrade
09:55	<arcade>	zcat[1] : It does.  Thing is, I usually only check whether it's supported by linux in general.
09:55	<pianoboy3333>	FunnyHat_Work: how can i fix this?
09:55	<dmbt>	!upgrade
=== mheath[laptop] _ is now known as mheath
09:55	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, best way to fix...  hmm.   Google for grub tutorials.
09:55	<dar>	qul est le canal franais ?
09:55	<soundray>	georgegay: do you have a modem or router?
09:55	<arcade>	zcat[1] : I go through the pain of getting it to work, but when support is out there, I think the distributors should do more to try'n support it out of the box.  Especially when it's just a newer kernel.
09:55	<zcat[1] >	Can't complain too much though, I get most of my hardware free trade-for-work or throwouts...
09:55	<Seveas>	!fr
09:55	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, you're going to have to do some console work in /boot/ and type something like ./grub i think
09:55	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
09:55	<pandamonium>	michaels, sorry no :( but google might be able to help if you search on about:config+firefox

09:56	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, the second link, "RECOVINGUBUNTO"etc.etc.
09:56	<pandamonium>	i know oyu double click on the properties and you can change the values
09:56	<FunnyHat_Work>	pianoboy3333, fscked = f*cked.   i was messin
09:56	<zcat[1] >	arcade: true, if there are opensource drivers ubuntu should definately work torwards including them. Wait a while and they probably will in a kernel update anyhow :)
09:56	<pianoboy3333>	FunnyHat_Work: oh, but I was seriously asking ;) lol
09:56	<nnz>	does it check for bad blocks when makin partitions?
09:56	<neutrinomas1>	It didn't work :( Host unreachable ...
09:56	<soundray>	!alternate

09:56	<davmor2>	jorgp desktop is live/install alternative is install/oem/etc
09:56	<arcade>	zcat[1] : Heh, I rather just go through the "lesser pain" which is "do it yourself" - and compile stuff. :)
09:56	<FunnyHat_Work>	that is your best bet
09:57	<neutrinomas1>	I also get "No DHCPOFFERS received."
09:57	<Xappe>	hmm, is there a way to direct gdesklets to different screens? when i'm restarting my session all desklets go to screen 0

10:02	<MagusG>	can anyone tell me what all is included on the dvd release?

10:03	<piphi>	I tried running dapper from live cd and all I get is 640x480 (nvidia geforce4)

10:04	<paulproteus>	mikeyyyy, My iBook at least had problems until I used a regular CD-R.
10:04	<mikeyyyy>	so use a cd r?
10:04	<BleedingThrough>	mite need to make sure you burned it as an image
10:04	<mikeyyyy>	i did
10:04	<paulproteus>	mikeyyyy, That's what I'd suggest.

10:05	<mikeyyyy>	what do rw do that make it not work?
10:05	<pandamonium>	paulproteus, i'm going to give my isp some grief over it though. i told them about the broken cache ages ago and they told me to explicitly set a working one... but they haven't fixed the broken one
10:05	<pandamonium>	i've taken some advice from trading standards over it
10:05	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, Well, good, ISPs should be given grief if they don't provide good internet service. (-:
10:05	<BleedingThrough>	oh yea, might have problems with the cd rw... sometimes they dont read in the drive properly and dont finalize
10:05	<paulproteus>	mikeyyyy, It's probably something about the drive that reads the CD-RW.
10:05	<paulproteus>	The one you're trying to boot on.
10:05	<paulproteus>	In my case, the iBook.
10:05	<eugman>	Anyone know why my font for chatzilla and slasldot looks crappy? No anti-aliasing? Default changed? Dapper is jealous of his older brother Breezy?
10:05	<BleedingThrough>	lol
10:05	<franzp>	paulproteus, did you have problems with the trackpad ??
10:06	<paulproteus>	franzp, No....
10:06	<paulproteus>	eugman, I don't know, but I explicitly told Firefox to use Bitstream fonts and then it looked better.
10:06	<eXistenZ>	dsas, Are a vim or an emacs guy?
10:06	<paulproteus>	Edit ->	Preferences ->	something
10:06	<franzp>	paulproteus, i guess you had luck.......i can't it to work as it sould
10:06	<dsas>	eXistenZ: I spend most of my day in vim at work
10:06	<piphi>	any way to load nvidia driver in live cd?
10:06	<disasm>	dsas: good choice ;-)
10:07	<paulproteus>	franzp, Well, powerbooks are different from ibooks.
10:07	<eXistenZ>	dsas, What do you program?
10:07	<eugman>	Ah, that helps a bit, paulproteus.
10:07	<your_mom>	i want to remove xgl, can someone tell me the name so i can remove
10:07	<pandamonium>	paulproteus, their telephone support is a joke... it sends you round and round a menu system before it finally tells you "this number is unavailable" and then cuts you off... honestly, it's like something out of the twilight zone
10:07	<paulproteus>	xserver-xgl , your_mom
10:07	<franzp>	paulproteus, well thanks anyway
10:07	<damned>	hi all
10:07	<your_mom>	thank you
10:07	<pandamonium>	anyway, thanks for the link... i'm going to try that now
10:07	<paulproteus>	franzp, Sure.  You should probably email Ben Collins or file a bug (or support request) against the kernel you're using.
10:07	<pandamonium>	:)
10:08	<damned>	anybody got vmware-player working in dapper?
10:08	<franzp>	paulproteus, thanks for the tip. i'll send one right away
10:08	<AnAnt>	paulproteus: but that is for linux kernels that are in Ubuntu's repos
10:08	<dsas>	eXistenZ: editing config files, ksh scripts, php/html/css/sql
10:08	<WimS>	hey, when i do modprobe ndiswrapper i get this error : "module ndiswrapper not found". When i do ndiswrapper -l it lists my card as detecded and river installed. Anybody know how i can get it to work ?
10:08	<jadaz87>	damned no i think vmware does not like dappers kernel
10:08	<paulproteus>	AnAnt, eh?
10:09	<AnAnt>	paulproteus: would those instructions work for kernel source that are not in the repos ?
10:09	<paulproteus>	franzp, Oh, let me see.
10:09	<mdke_>	is there a simple command I can do to convert a Unix style date stamp into a normal date?
10:09	<eXistenZ>	dsas, you do even php on vim?
10:09	<paulproteus>	AnAnt, Have you compiled a kernel before?
10:09	<damned>	jadaz87: yup... looks like that.
10:09	<paulproteus>	AnAnt, If so, I can bring you up to speed much faster.
10:10	<QMario>	What happens if I remove the Linux-image package?
10:10	<disasm>	eXistenZ: i do php in vim as well, it's not that odd is it?
10:10	<Hentai_Jeff>	I'm booting to the new dapper live CD to install and I keep getting a I/O buffer error
10:10	<AnAnt>	paulproteus: yup I did
10:10	<scifi>	just got: Failed to fetch http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/m/mozilla-firefox.............
10:10	<Hentai_Jeff>	on hdc
10:10	<pianoboy3333>	How can one use fsck?
10:10	<scifi>	when updating to dapper
10:10	<eXistenZ>	disasm, not much
10:10	<Hentai_Jeff>	anyone else having that probulm?
10:10	<paulproteus>	AnAnt, Okay, great.  Then instead of make bzimage (or whatever you kids do these days), do:
10:10	<disasm>	eXistenZ: what do you use?
10:11	<eXistenZ>	disasm, I use vim as well =)
10:11	<paulproteus>	sudo make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-custom kernel_image kernel_headers
10:11	<QMario>	Will it break my system?
10:11	<scifi>	says use -fix-missing, how do i use that command ?
10:11	<paulproteus>	make-kpkg will make a kernel package.  --initrd is easy to understand, I hope; --append-to-version can be whatever you want, like your name.
10:11	<paulproteus>	scifi, On a command line, try: sudo apt-get --fix-missing install
10:12	<dsas>	eXistenZ: yeah, everything.
10:12	<pandamonium>	Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/shadow/login_4.0.3-37ubuntu8_i386.deb
10:12	<pandamonium>	  Could not resolve http
10:12	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, That's pretty weird.
10:12	<paulproteus>	Are you sure you specified the proxy right?
10:12	<AnAnt>	paulproteus: what I mean is, do I have to get the kernel source from Ubuntu's repos, or I can get the original tarballs from kernel.org for example
10:12	<paulproteus>	AnAnt, kernel_image and kernel_headers are the names of the packages you'll build.
10:12	<KNY[linux] >	just ran a dist-upgrade and Dapper is awesome so far
10:12	<KriS|>	!sources
10:12	<paulproteus>	AnAnt, You can get the kernel tarballs from anywhere.
10:12	<KNY[linux] >	one question though; where's the XGL?
10:12	<ubotu>	To enable Universe and Multiverse see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/AddingRepositoriesHowto - Official sources.lists here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 (Breezy) or http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 (Dapper) see also !easysource
10:12	<disasm>	paulproteus: speaking of kernels, whats the best way to not have ubuntu install a new stock kernel every time one comes out (I compile all mine from vanilla sources with any patches I want to add)
10:12	<AnAnt>	paulproteus: ok, thanks
10:12	<cyphase>	ah, #ubuntu+1 points here
10:13	<paulproteus>	disasm, apt-get remove linux-686 or whatever other linux-* metapackages you have.
10:13	<paulproteus>	disasm, Note that from now on, they'll only do that for security updates.
10:13	<disasm>	ok, thanks

10:15	<deadcat>	if i have requested for cds in the pass. do i have to request again or they will send it to me automatically?
10:15	<Sub>	yes it is philstar
10:15	<shaitand>	I recently reported a missing driver for a SATA2 controller chip on my board. The bug report now shows that the patch will be in the next Dapper kernel update. Do those updates get merged into the cd image? If not, can the updates be downloaded during the installation before the installer needs to access the drive that is on that controller?
10:15	<hyperactivecrond>	master_of_master: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
10:15	<Sub>	master_of_master, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

10:15	<Sub>	oh beat me too it :D
10:16	<disasm>	anyone else have problems with massive package dependency problems with upgrading kubuntu breezy (As soon as I get it upgraded I'm planning on getting rid of all the KDE packages and installing gdm and gnome, but it's what I put on my sisters comp last year...)
10:16	<matthew_w>	Hey guys -
10:16	<pandamonium>	same thing :(
10:16	<zcat[1] >	Why does wine use such ugly fonts instead of the prefectly good ones everything else comes up in ?
10:16	<matthew_w>	Will sudo apt-get dist-upgrade work to put me to dapper after replacing all instances of breezy in my /etc/apt/sources.list?
10:16	<philstar>	Sub: thanks, seems wikipedia got it wrong, they've got same wallpaper as beta

10:16	<deadcat>	if i have requested for cds in the pass. do i have to request again or they will send it to me automatically?
10:16	<JDahl>	disasm: why don't you remove kde first, and dist-upgrade from a console?
10:16	<disasm>	it's no big deal, just everytime dpkg dies, have to dpkg -r some packages, and then dist-upgrade again till the next break
10:17	<matthew_w>	jorgp; When I did that for breezy, it missed some things
10:17	<matthew_w>	jorgp; Are you sure this won't?
10:17	<disasm>	JDahl: might not be a bad idea
10:17	<matthew_w>	(particularly, the boot screen did not show.)
10:17	<scifi>	k updated in synaptic, then ran sudo apt-get dist-upgrade again and it downloaded mozilla fine :)
10:17	<jorgp>	matthew_w, it should not

10:18	<Sub>	Aeudian, have you got the "build-essential" package?
10:18	<Sub>	Aeudian, if not type "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
10:18	<disasm>	JDahl: next question, any easier way to get rid of all kde packages other than getting a list of them from dpkg -l and apt-get remove <list of packages>
10:18	<eggzeck>	deadcat: you have to request again.
10:18	<deadcat>	eggzeck: doh
10:18	<zcat[1] >	deadcat: in theory it's automatic. In practise I waited three months, got nothing, and re-ordered..
10:18	<Aeudian>	sub: not sure let me see
10:18	<scifi>	o dear i think its re-replacing everything else as well :O
10:19	<kevor>	Hi, question: is Hoary still being maintained? Got a Hoary computer that needs one program installed, no time to update the whole box to Dapper.
10:19	<gumpish>	durrr... how do I boot without X Windows? I tried typing "Linux 3" at the boot: prompt, to no avail.
10:19	<Sub>	Aeudian, its not there by default
10:19	<disasm>	JDahl: or for that matter, all of X, and I could start installing from scratch?
10:19	<BrianG>	i can't get any sound out of rhythmbox and i get no sound when my session starts or ends

10:19	<franzp>	i can't get my trackpad to work on dapper drake....anyone can help me ?
10:19	<zcat[1] >	eggzeck: yeah, I understood you didn't need to reorder, but firsthand I know you do!
10:19	<Aeudian>	sub: nope i dont thanks
10:19	<crimsun>	kevor: yes, it's supported until October
10:19	<pandamonium>	i can cope with "Not enough beer error: You're not drunk enough to attempt this installation. Drain a few cans then try again"
10:19	<eggzeck>	zcat[1] : "In theory it's automatic"? You need to reorder :)
10:19	<kevor>	crimsun: thank you
10:19	<pandamonium>	i've had that a number of times
10:19	<zcat[1] >	wlug has an installfest in a month, we probably want at least 50, perhaps 100...
10:20	<JDahl>	disasm: I think removing kubuntu-desktop will get you far.  You could remove xserver-xorg also, but I would keep it
10:20	<pandamonium>	but this http thingy has me baffled
10:20	<disasm>	gumpish: go into rescue kernel, and remove gdm from startup
10:20	<gumpish>	thanks
10:20	<pandamonium>	perhaps... and this is a long shot... perhaps i should try switching it off and back on again
10:20	<zcat[1] >	eggzeck: there was something in the website back then about not needing to reorder. Serves me right for actually reading the instructions? :)
10:20	<silke>	hallo an alle
10:20	<franzp>	hallo

10:23	<zcat[1] >	xfci is faster, gnome and kde are approx the same in my experience..

10:30	<Sub>	may i ask what your trying to compile?
10:30	<shaitand>	I recently reported a missing driver for a SATA2 controller chip on my board. The bug report now shows that the patch will be in the next Dapper kernel update. Do those updates get merged into the stable cd image? If not, can the updates be downloaded during the installation?
10:30	<Sub>	is it gimpshop?
10:30	<paulproteus>	goonzoo, You want read-write NTFS?
10:30	<gnomefreak>	eXistenZ: try installing java from the sun-java site and follow the instructions on the restricted site
10:30	<paulproteus>	Here's how:
10:30	<philstar>	Seveas: I believe this is experimental in the kernel, has been for a while?
10:30	<WimS>	gnomefreak, yeah i know that, but ndiswrapper doesn't work on my linux bot after upgrading so i'm going to install it by source. But i need the kernel headers and without network on the linux box i need to download them manually with windows
10:30	<zerokarmaleft>	i'm running into this bug in dapper, https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg/+bug/40748, any ideas on where i can get more info to report?
10:30	<goonzoo>	yes
10:30	<ciaron>	hmm after checking disk integrity on the server disk it goes into some wierd error loop
10:30	<paulproteus>	goonzoo, Install the package called fuse-utils.
10:30	<Aeudian>	Sub: im trying to install gbindadmin gui for bind9
10:30	<paulproteus>	Then use the program "ntfsmount" to mount your NTFS.
10:30	<Seveas>	philstar, experimental for a good reason
10:30	<Aeudian>	sub: also says "No package 'gtk+-2.0' found"
10:30	<gnomefreak>	i remember i had to do that last time i installe dit
10:31	<WimS>	linux box*
10:31	<paulproteus>	Read its man page if you need more, goonzoo.
10:31	<TaTonka>	can any1 help me with my soundcard problem :(
10:31	<philstar>	Seveas: what happened to captive?
10:31	<gnomefreak>	WimS: if you read the pm it tells you how to install them

10:31	<bina>	does anyone know of a prog in Linux that will play mp3 with DRM?
10:31	<goonzoo>	what page ?
10:31	<thug>	does anyone know why it only save 27.mb from the iso image ?
10:31	<Sub>	well Auedian, im not sure, i need to go grab something to eat, so maybe worth asking someone else

10:31	<hollerith>	is it possible to get use my original breezy disk to fresh install Breezy again
10:31	<Seveas>	philstar, never ported to fuse
10:31	<Aeudian>	Sub: okay later

10:32	<andrewguy>	Booo: I'm downloading it for my mini..
10:32	<andrewguy>	Booo:  if that counts hah.
10:32	<WimS>	gnomefreak it doesn't say where i can download it from. Since internet dont work on my linux box i need to get it manually with windows
10:32	<gnomefreak>	hollerith: yes
10:32	<gnomefreak>	WimS: they are in main repo iirc
10:32	<kane777>	a question... could this "Details: Error reading file 'file:///usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop': File not found" when trying to run home from places menu be anyhow connected to fact that i accidentally uninstalled gnome?? Also many options in system administration are gone... does that have to do with the fact that i uninstalled gnome???
10:32	<goonzoo>	ok thanx i'll try
10:32	<gnomefreak>	WimS: all you should have to do is type the command in terminal and they should install

10:35	<shaitand>	I recently reported a missing driver for a SATA2 controller chip on my board. The bug report now shows that the patch will be in the next Dapper kernel update. Do those updates get merged into the stable cd image? If not, can the updates be downloaded during the installation?
10:35	<ktogias>	I use fglrx driver for X at my laptop. I installed linux-686 and I noticed that when booting the 686 kernel xorg use much more cpu than when running 386 kernel. Is it a bug? Whould reconfiguring xorg or fglrx package while in 686 fix it?
10:35	<ciaron>	what does use LVM mean in the first partition menu?
10:36	<zcat[1] >	It's funny installing stuff in wine .. double click, next, next, OK, next, 'reboot' .. for every program. Windows users think linux is hard? In synaptic I'd just click a few boxes and go..!!
10:36	<rukuartic>	Are there any good cli iptable config programs?
10:36	<shaitand>	ciaron Large Volume Manager, if you use it properly it will allow you to have a single volume that spans multiple disks.
10:36	<Sub>	rukuartic, iptables???
10:36	<scifi>	gnomefreak: i get the feeling its installing all 72,000 packages, i hope thats not the case ?
10:36	<kane777>	thug, well have you tried downloading it from BT (bit torrent)... obviously your connection was reset/failed during download... try bittorrent... this way you can resume broken downloads...
10:36	<disasm>	rukuartic: bash?
10:36	<jazzido>	Is the upgrade still inactive? i saw a post on launchpad about that b/c of problems with nvidia packages
10:36	<gnomefreak>	scifi: no
10:36	<pandamonium>	paulproteus, i've uploaded the info you asked for to some webspace
10:36	<frying_fish>	zcat[1] : yeah, I know the feeling
10:36	<Wizardling>	Could someone please help me find out what Macs are supported by the new release of Ubuntu?
10:36	<rukuartic>	Sub, disasm: I'm too lazy to print out a 50 page manual and read it, already did it with Rsync?
10:36	<pandamonium>	i can message you the url
10:36	<gnomefreak>	shouldnt be and where did you get 72000 packages?
10:36	<jimcooncat>	LVM = Logical Volume Manager
10:37	<frying_fish>	I'm currently trying to install pro evolution soccer 5, unsucessfully, no matter what I try.
10:37	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, Well, fine, URL?
10:37	<thug>	kane777 no the connection didnt failed
10:37	<Wizardling>	and WTF is it so hard to find a list of supported computers?
10:37	<pianoboy3333>	Where is the firefox xml file for bookmarks?
10:37	<Sgeo>	I was under the impression that the upgrade-mananger would do something
10:37	<ciaron>	ah i see, k next question :) this LAMP install thing, is just the same as the basic server install with the 4 packages on top? or is there anything else different about it?
10:37	<disasm>	rukuartic: what are you trying to do with iptables? nat? block everything?
10:37	<scifi>	gnomefreak: i remember it being a figure like that in the summary at the bottom of synaptic
10:37	<LinuxJones>	Wizardling, what computers ?
10:37	<thug>	kane777 never seen this before ...

10:42	<tkrin>	Sound is horrible.  any advice?
10:42	<disasm>	Wizardling: you shouldn't have any problems though, only problem I've seen is wireless on laptops (stupid broadcom)
10:42	<rackerz>	IRC: sudo apt-get install totem-xine xine-ui
10:42	<intelikey>	dsas so there is no change from nonday ?
10:42	<eXistenZ>	gnomefreak, I have ATI 9250, is it considered with the 9200 family?

10:42	<Wes>	6 can someone help me?
10:42	<pinky>	happy day everyone!
10:42	<Wizardling>	Well, that won't be an issue for me.
10:42	<maikol>	how does one configure a usb wireless device
10:42	<gnomefreak>	eXistenZ: not sure i dont play with ati
10:43	<zcat[1] >	I ordered on shipit a week ago... ten u's and ten k's ...
10:43	<rukuartic>	Wes: Thats very odd. There might be a problem with hard drives with more than 7 partitions or smoething. I'm really not all that managable. Were you going to just format the hard drive or were you trying to keep your partitions?
10:43	<andrewguy>	tkrin:  I'm going to install it on my mini g4 are you running into problems with it or anything?
10:43	<TaTonka>	ubuntu doesnt detect my soundcard
10:43	<Wizardling>	I use 100Mbps baseT on all my desktops
10:43	<thug>	IRC looks like you`re the one who needs help :)
10:43	<IRC>	thug: yeah... i suck at linux
10:43	<tkrin>	andrewguy: Airport is a bit flaky, but I got it working.  need to use CLI to control it.
10:43	<livingdaylight>	ok,what happened? upgraded to Dapper and my sytem wouldn't detect eth0?
10:43	<Wes>	rukuartic: I want to keep my partitions, it's never been a problem before with any other version with the text install
10:43	<r0xoR>	wait, wtf is up with this "server install" version?
10:43	<thug>	IRC ubuntu rocks man
10:43	<tkrin>	andrewguy: sound works but quality is quite bad.
10:43	<rukuartic>	IRC, its a learning experience :P takes a while to learn
10:43	<zcat[1] >	TaTonka: and your soundcard / chipset is ??
10:43	<eobanb>	r0xoR, if you don't know what it is, you don't need it
10:43	<TaTonka>	my soundcard is onboard a sis 5598.......... its controller is Crystal Audio Chipset
10:44	<Wizardling>	Wow - I've not seen #ubuntu this busy for a while :-) It's great!
10:44	<tkrin>	andrewguy: other than those two things, works quite nicely, IMO.
10:44	<shaitand>	Anybody know of a good howto on putting custom packages into the Ubutunu live cd install?
10:44	<xanavim>	r0xoR: nothing special, it's a server install
10:44	<sala2038>	anybody help me to upgrade of Brezzy to Dapper ?????
10:44	<kane777>	thug, so there are two possibilities... try downloading via jigsaw or bittorrent... or there is one more wget... this can resume downloads as well... or there is just one more... ship it cds... but I think you don't want to wait two months... :)
10:44	<andrewguy>	tkrin:  thanks for the heads up.
10:44	<thug>	linux aint no click click finish thing
10:44	<Soggoth>	Hello everybody! Can someone help me, i need some info
10:44	<eobanb>	!tell TaTonka about sound
10:44	<intelikey>	dsas so there is no change from monday until now ?
10:44	<r0xoR>	i don't get it... if you want to install it on a computer... you have to use the "server install" version?
10:44	<rukuartic>	r0xoR: It basically means things are streamlined for performance. It also means its kinda hard to use :P Basically, no nice pretty gui
10:44	<IRC>	yeah, ubuntu is great it just has a learning curve
10:44	<dsas>	intelikey: not that I remember
10:44	<kane777>	a question... could this "Details: Error reading file 'file:///usr/share/applications/nautilus-home.desktop': File not found" when trying to run home from places menu be anyhow connected to fact that i accidentally uninstalled gnome?? Also many options in system administration are gone... does that have to do with the fact that i uninstalled gnome???
10:44	<rackerz>	IRC: if you've installed w32codecs then streaming wmv should work. and if you've instaleld totem.
10:44	<rukuartic>	r0xoR: No you don't. Chose the first option, and then doubleclick on the "Install to Hard Drive"
10:44	<r0xoR>	wait, so how do install a normal desktop then?
10:44	<Wes>	@Rukuartic:  I want to keep my partitions, it's never been a problem before with any other version with the text install, is there a way to access the text install with Dapper?
10:44	<dsas>	intelikey: what's the output of dpkg-l pcmcia -cs ?
10:44	<xanavim>	r0xoR: no, you don't *have* to use the server install version
10:44	<tkrin>	andrewguy: no problem.  GL
10:44	<willdev>	hey people
10:44	<sala2038>	anybody help me to upgrade of Brezzy to Dapper ?????
10:44	<revmouse>	I have a Dell Latitude 100L, and my LCD screen doesn't turn off when I close the lid, but it shuts off after 10 minutes of inactivity. any ideas?
10:45	<dsas>	intelikey: sorry that should be dpkg -l pcmcia-cs
10:45	<Soggoth>	I have a Compaq nc6220 and i cannot get the wireless adapter that is integrated to work
10:45	<r0xoR>	wow, this is totally non-human friendly lol
10:45	<zcat[1] >	r0xoR: no, there's just ONE disk now that does live CD and install. the alternative one is an 'alternative'
10:45	<willdev>	anyone got a torrent for ubuntu 6?
10:45	<xanavim>	r0xoR: should be the top option for installation
10:45	<IRC>	rackerz: theres nothing. the playback box is black and if i click on play it goes automatically to pause.
10:45	<eobanb>	!tell sala2038 about upgrade
10:45	<dsas>	!tell sala2038 about upgrade

10:45	<r0xoR>	uhhh... i see "desktop" and "server install" and "alternate install" those are the only three i see
10:45	<sala2038>	dsas, Thanks
10:45	<IRC>	rackerz: my pc or firefox?
10:45	<r0xoR>	ohhhh
10:45	<r0xoR>	ok then :)
10:45	<delire_nacht>	r0xoR: choose 'desktop' if you're installing on a desktop.

10:46	<Wes>	@all: is there a way to text install with Dapper Drake?
10:46	<r0xoR>	zcat[1] , huh, that's an interesting approach then :)
10:46	<rukuartic>	Wes: I'm sorry... I'm not all that knowledgable with that stuff =\ I'm sorry I can't help you. You could try looking at /dev, (ls /dev/hd*) to see if its recognizing your partitions
10:46	<dsas>	intelikey: two ticks,
10:46	<dodek>	hi
10:46	<eobanb>	Wes, yes, download the install CD rather than the desktop CD
10:46	<gnomefreak>	Wes: get the alternative iso
10:46	<Booo>	i just installed ubuntu 6 on my g4 powerbook but so far the mouse pad, and wireless is not working
10:46	<intelikey>	dsas why would i have pc-card support on a box with no pc cards ?
10:46	<xanavim>	r0xoR: it's a try-before-you-install technique  (:
10:46	<dodek>	where should i report bugs in translation?
10:46	<zcat[1] >	hopefully this means zhipit can now send out disks to twice as many people since they'll only be sending one disk..
10:46	<dsas>	intelikey: Yeah i just realised my mistake :)

10:47	<r0xoR>	xanavim, yeah, but i usually enjoy having a separate "all i want to do is install" variety :)
10:47	<Wizardling>	So if I want maximum performance without flashy pretty GUI overheads, what's the best version of Ubuntu?
10:47	<dsas>	intelikey: if dpkg -l ubuntu-minimal is at version 0.119 you're fully up to date
10:47	<GaiaX11>	Whys is that when i try to install base-config synaptic warn me that will uninstall the whole kde and gnome base system?
10:47	<xanavim>	r0xoR: it takes the same amount of time to load
10:47	<r0xoR>	can i just type "install" at the boot prompt instead then?
10:47	<kane777>	OK... solved... now only one more question: I lost some shortcuts in system->Administration menu. What packages are "responsible" for those icons??
10:47	<revmouse>	I have a Dell Latitude 100L running dapper, and my LCD screen doesn't turn off when I close the lid, but it shuts off after 10 minutes of inactivity. any ideas?
10:47	<livingdaylight>	upgrading to Dapper broke my system?
10:47	<dsas>	Wizardling: the server install, or xubuntu if you want a gui.
10:47	<livingdaylight>	where did K3B go?
10:47	<xanavim>	r0xoR: plus you can rescue and/or install with it, so one less cd to burn
10:48	<dodek>	where should i report bugs in translation?
10:48	<rukuartic>	revmouse: Try http://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/ Make a page for them, help them bugtest!
10:48	<r0xoR>	hmmm, i guess so
10:48	<jorgp>	sn't https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CDRipping a little bit dated, talking about gstreamer-0.8 instead of 0.10
10:48	<Tzy>	Hi, how can you see if you have the latest version of ubuntu installed (6.06) I have dapper beta running, didn't do an update for the past 2 day's and if I want to dist upgrade now there is nothing to upgrade ... :s
10:48	<eobanb>	Booo, try this: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=142727
10:48	<GaiaX11>	Why is that when i try to install base-config synaptic warn me that will uninstall the whole kde and gnome base system?
10:48	<livingdaylight>	GUYS! common, where did K3B go?

10:48	<willdev>	can we go slower?
10:48	<yoyoyo>	rackerz: same thing. nothing.
10:48	<livingdaylight>	upgraded to Dapper and suddenly lost eth0
10:48	<rukuartic>	Tzy: If there's no upgrades, then you're running 6.06 ^^
10:48	<intelikey>	dsas anyother way to tell ?
10:48	<delire>	Tzy: dist-upgrade is for upgrading to a whole other disitribution version. you just want apt-get upgrade
10:48	<zcat[1] >	livingdaylight: upgrading to dapper broke my system too. Backup home (mine was a different partition) and do a clean install.. it's a hassle but I don't expect the path from XP to Vista is going to be better :)
10:48	<eobanb>	Tzy, 6.06 IS the latest version
10:49	<xanavim>	willdev: there's 1,000 people here  (:
10:49	<livingdaylight>	rukuartic; yea, but had k3b in breezy, why did upgrading loose it?
10:49	<rackerz>	yoyoyo: what problems are you having?
10:49	<dsas>	intelikey: I'm just reading out the last packages that were updated
10:49	<Tzy>	strange becouse I dindn't do an update for the past 2 day's :s

10:50	<zcat[1] >	I had a lot of crap on my install, gnome, kde, edubuntu, etc. It neaded a reinstall anyhow :)
10:50	<TaTonka>	that didnt really help,..
10:50	<dsas>	intelikey: there were a few things
10:50	<eobanb>	Wizardling, it's a combination of using less RAM and less CPU, mostly
10:50	<livingdaylight>	having upgraded to Dapper what is it i should do now, that is essential. When i upgraded 39 packages were lost. Should i run automatix?
10:50	<kane777>	OK... solved... now only one more question: I lost some shortcuts in system->Administration menu. What packages are "responsible" for those icons?? I only have device manager, disks, networking, printing, services,shared folder, synaptic, time and date, user groups... I know that there were more of them... can anybody help, please???
10:50	<GaiaX11>	How do i see modules in ubuntu? Since i cannot install base-config?
10:50	<gnomefreak>	livingdaylight: no
10:50	<gnomefreak>	!automatix
10:50	<ubotu>	somebody said automatix was unsafe, it overwrites configuration files, and does things like "echo -e 'y\nY\n'" that are considered risky. Please do not use it. There are alternative applications, such as !easyubuntu.
10:50	<eobanb>	Wizardling, you're welcome to just try installing xubuntu-desktop alongside gnome and seeing which you like better.

10:54	<scifi>	rukuartic: i have had to boot into xp, i tried booting into an older ubuntu build from grub menu but it just tried to go into dapper again
10:54	<runes>	does amorak and vlc support multiple audio and video codecs?
10:54	<eobanb>	grasshopper, then it's there because you installed it there yourself
10:54	<Bizzeh>	and not just run the stupid live cd

10:54	<rukuartic>	scifi: Nooo You're in dapper now. No going back to older ubuntus.
10:54	<sibblegp>	when I use a terminal in KDE now that I've upgraded to dapper, my backspace key when held won't go back more than a single space!
10:55	<grasshopper>	man, seems like automatix is some kind of virus
10:55	<intelikey>	ok.   i guess if i'd install lsb now it will set a lsb_release to say dapper lts  ?
10:55	<gnomefreak>	intelikey: if your not showing updates your up to date
10:55	<kane777>	OK... solved... now only one more question: I lost some shortcuts in system->Administration menu. What packages are "responsible" for those icons?? I only have device manager, disks, networking, printing, services,shared folder, synaptic, time and date, user groups... I know that there were more of them... can anybody help, please???
10:55	<eobanb>	grasshopper, please do not ask about automatix anymore; if you choose to use it you're completely on your own; i recommend reading the forum instead and using synaptic, or if you really have to, easyubuntu
10:55	<gnomefreak>	grasshopper: it is a very fast/sure way to mess up your pb
10:55	<gnomefreak>	c
10:55	<yoyoyo>	rackerz: no i havent but ill give it a try
10:55	<eobanb>	grasshopper, automatix is not a virus
10:55	<Bizzeh>	i got http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-amd64.iso and it is just a live cd
10:55	<rukuartic>	scifi: Um... Ok well do you know how to use a terminal? I can't help you reconfigure xorg, but I can help you on your way
10:55	<NoUse>	kane777 is the ubuntu-desktop package installed?
10:55	<eobanb>	grasshopper, it's just a crappy tool to use
10:55	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, do you know of a way that i can fix the problem dapper is having with davicom ethernet adapter?
10:55	<Firebird8>	if dapper is realsing as 6.06 what would be the next version?
10:55	<Bizzeh>	why have the live cd, not marked as such
10:55	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Didja click the "Install to HD" script on the desktopo?
10:55	<pandamonium>	paulproteus, did you get a chance to see the info yet?
10:55	<rackerz>	yoyoyo: it's probably the best option. it configures everything for you :)
10:55	<eobanb>	Firebird8, the Edgy Eft
10:55	<manolis>	is there any good download manager for ubuntu?
10:55	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: click on the "install" and install it to your hard drive
10:56	<gnomefreak>	Firebird8: 6.10
10:56	<kane777>	NoUse, hmm.. let me see...
10:56	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, No, did you give me a URI to it?
10:56	<gnomefreak>	h3h_timo: no i dont
10:56	<Bizzeh>	rukuartic: what desktop?
10:56	<ciaron>	wow sshd isn't installed by default, thats harsh :)
10:56	<sibblegp>	can someone tell me why the keyboard repeat is no longer functioning in Dapper?
10:56	<scifi>	rukuartic: can i startup a cli x-chat if i boot into dapper and use the cli ?
10:56	<pandamonium>	i think i /msg one to you
10:56	<revmouse>	gnomefreak: what determines ubuntu's version numbers?
10:56	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Let the livecd boot.
10:56	<Firebird8>	GNAM, i thought it went *.04 *.10 *.04 etc
10:56	<Bizzeh>	i did
10:56	<eobanb>	ciaron, so install it.  not running ssh by default is much more secure.
10:56	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: the desktop, i.e. the pretty picture with file icons on it
10:56	<Bizzeh>	i got to where it wanted to boot
10:56	<rukuartic>	scifi: no, just type "Irssi" into the command prompt
10:56	<grasshopper>	eobanb; i say virus, because it seems to linger like a disease. I don't recall ever using it. The forums were raving about it so i had a look, but i want to be rid of the pest
10:56	<FunnyHat_Work>	revmouse, mmyy
10:56	<gnomefreak>	revmouse: 6 = 2006 06= june
10:56	<delire>	revmouse: month/year
10:56	<Bizzeh>	when it tried to load x
10:56	<Bizzeh>	it didnt
10:56	<Bizzeh>	and died
10:56	<Bizzeh>	tried 4 times
10:56	<delire>	revmouse: actually year:month ;)
10:56	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, I don't think you did.
10:56	<Bizzeh>	it cannot load x
10:56	<Jinkguns>	heya
10:56	<gnomefreak>	its year first month 2nd
10:57	<willdev101>	is drapper friendly to ATI cards?
10:57	<tbenita>	I changes  breezy to hoary in my sources.list and tried to dist-upgrade, now when I try to install gnome it says that it's not going to install
10:57	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, is there a way to find drivers for the adapter and install them over the ones currently installed?
10:57	<eobanb>	ciaron, you have to understand that most users of ubuntu don't need ssh, and those that do use it should know enough about it to know how to install and set it up themselves.  it's a self-solving problem
10:57	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Ouch. Um... Need to go somewhere else for that. But all we send out is LiveCD's. Takes the same ammount of time
10:57	<Bizzeh>	because the "ati" driver doesnt work
10:57	<xanavim>	willdev101: yes, most of them
10:57	<scifi>	rukuartic: what does that do ?
10:57	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, You have to be registered with NickServ for private messages to work.
10:57	<ivoks>	jesus... 1055 people :)
10:57	<Bizzeh>	its the "fglrx" driver i need
10:57	<xanavim>	,ati
10:57	<delire>	tbenita: why are you downgrading?
10:57	<revmouse>	willdev101: I have an ATI with the fglrx driver, it works great
10:57	<tbenita>	ups : changes sources.list to drapper
10:57	<xanavim>	ubotu: ati
10:57	<pandamonium>	ah, that would explain it
10:57	<ubotu>	I guess ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ... the radeon 9200 and below are supported by the open-source drivers
10:57	<ciaron>	eobanb: true, was just a bit suprised thats all :) it is the server edition after all, but it is more secure yes
10:57	<Jinkguns>	I have a question, I just installed Network Manager but I can't find any type of menu entry to access it.
10:57	<eobanb>	ivoks, what can i say, it's the day of dapper's release.  i'm sure it'll climb even higher in a few hours
10:57	<rukuartic>	scifi: irssi = irc chat ^_^ "/connect irc.freenode.net" and then "/join #ubuntu"
10:57	<gnomefreak>	h3h_timo: check the hardware site see if your network adapter is supported it should give drivers/instructions from there
10:58	<ivoks>	eobanb: :)
10:58	<nnz>	is there any disk checking util for bad blocks?
10:58	<xanavim>	Jinkguns: try man NetworkManager
10:58	<eobanb>	ciaron, just sudo apt-get install ssh
10:58	<Bizzeh>	ok, so, run the live cd
10:58	<pandamonium>	http://www.eggwhisk.co.uk/ubuntu/config.html
10:58	<delire>	tbenita: there's no need to do that. that's the wrong way to do it. do this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
10:58	<ciaron>	eobanb: thats the client isn't it?
10:58	<rukuartic>	ciaron: or if you want the daemon, use sshd.
10:58	<gnomefreak>	rukuartic: chat.freenode.net
10:58	<pandamonium>	that would be it
10:58	<Bizzeh>	how do i make it load fglrx?
10:58	<rukuartic>	gnomefreak: I use IRC ;p
10:58	<ciaron>	ah yes
10:58	<ivoks>	so, how do you like dapper?
10:58	<eobanb>	ciaron, as far as i know the ssh metapackage includes both the client and sshd.
10:58	<l>	can someone help me? i just installed proftpd but i cannot get my machine to accept an ftp connection
10:58	<willdev101>	would drapper work on a x300 card?
10:58	<tbenita>	I take a look thx delire
10:58	<eXistenZ>	!ati
10:58	<ubotu>	hmm... ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ... the radeon 9200 and below are supported by the open-source drivers
10:58	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, alright thanks
10:58	<eobanb>	willdev, sure, just make sure to install ati's drivers
10:59	<rukuartic>	l: You might be behind a firewall, or your ISP may not let you accept connections, or you may have it configured properly. But I have to go now, just throwing out some ideas.
10:59	<scifi>	rukuartic: ok sweet, i'll brb after reboot :)
10:59	<dmbt>	just curios, anyone know when and if the automatic update mechanism is going to be activated?
10:59	<pandamonium>	hold on... scrub that
10:59	<willdev101>	how do i do that?
10:59	<pandamonium>	just realisd it's a mess
10:59	<Bizzeh>	ok, all i have, is a blank hard drive, and a live cd
10:59	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, Hah, okay.
10:59	<rukuartic>	scifi: No problem ^^ Good luck getting the problem solved
10:59	<Bizzeh>	how do i get fglrx
10:59	<Bizzeh>	so i can get X to run
10:59	<eobanb>	dmbt, if you don't feel like waiting for the automatic update, just invoke it yourself
10:59	<blehe>	Hey will ubuntu resize my windows partition for me?
10:59	<ciaron>	eobanb: yeah its changed in dapper from what i can see, ssh is now a transitional package for openss-{client|server}
10:59	<eobanb>	!tell dmbt about update
10:59	<Bizzeh>	so i can install it to my hdd
10:59	<willdev101>	eobamb@ How do i install them?
10:59	<l>	firestarter&can someon help me? i am getting this error when i try to open an ftp connection to my computer
10:59	<dmbt>	eobanb: no, i'm fine for myself
10:59	<delire>	tbenita: in short, change the sources.list back to breezy, apt-get update and then: gksudo "update-manager -d"
10:59	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Try putting your question all in one line, it helps people see your question better
10:59	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: the ati instructions ubotu mentioned show you how
10:59	<dmbt>	its others im woried about
10:59	<hilltop>	I put "/dev/hda4 /media/hda4 vfat rw,users,iocharset=utf8,umask=000 0 0" in fstab and "sudo mount-a" but the vfat partition won't mount as w/r. Ideas?? Thanks
11:00	<Jinkguns>	So network manager has no graphical front end?
11:00	<Bizzeh>	xanavim: they show me how to do it, in an installed ubuntu
11:00	<nnz>	why does it say err http://archive.ubuntu.com dapper/main sources and etc connection failed [ip:*.*.] 
11:00	<eobanb>	Jinkguns, of course it does
11:00	<Bizzeh>	not on a read only livecd
11:00	<Booo>	looks like my airport extreme drivers works but when it scans for network it return nothing and it comes back to quick
11:00	<kane777>	NoUse, now i'm running into severe dependencies problems libglib2.0-data:
11:00	<kane777>	  Depends: libglib2.0-0 (=2.8.3-0ubuntu1) but 2.8.3-1 is to be installed
11:00	<tbenita>	ok delire ; apt-get dist-upgrade doesn't do it ?
11:00	<Wes>	Can someone help me with the Dapper Drake Partitioner?
11:00	<eobanb>	Wes, what is your specific question?
11:00	<Ademan>	k when you edit # defoptions=quiet splash       line from /boot/grub/menu.lst  what do you have to do to for it to take effect?
11:00	<oknewbie>	Does anyone here know how to block an ip with apache2 perferable with a custom message
11:01	<Jinkguns>	eobanb, well there is no menu entry and the man page dosen't mention it
11:01	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: there's a good chance using fglrx will only give you fast 3d
11:01	<delire>	tbenita: best to use the above command.
11:01	<Booo>	has anyone here gotten airport extreme working?
11:01	<ipfw>	how long will it be before #ubuntu+1 is opened back up ?
11:01	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: it probably won't solve your problem
11:01	<eobanb>	oknewbie, yes, you can do that by adding a directive to your httpd.conf file.  you may want to ask in #apache about that, however
11:01	<Wes>	eobanb: The partitioner is not recognizing my partitions already on the HDD
11:01	<NoUse>	kane777 how did you upgrade?
11:01	<tbenita>	ok delire
11:01	<Bizzeh>	xanavim: there is a better chance that it will give me a gui
11:01	<Bizzeh>	because it always has in the past
11:01	<Booo>	anyone
11:01	<oknewbie>	thanx
11:01	<grasshopper>	eobanb; what happened to my internet connexion

11:07	<RandolphCarter>	Bizzeh: I know they share code, but that one stands a much better chance of working
11:07	<Bizzeh>	RandolphCarter: on a read only live cd?
11:07	<maple>	delire: ok. so if a x86 version wont boot then a amd64 version probly wont boot either?
11:07	<sebest>	hello, i'm using network-manager but it doesn't set my dns
11:07	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: download the alternate cd installer
11:07	<pike__>	l: check the config file in /etc directory
11:07	<maple>	delire: well it boots, but it wont actually start up
11:07	<RandolphCarter>	Bizzeh: sure, it should be loaded into RAM afaik, check /etc/X11/xorg.conf
11:07	<eobanb>	Symmetria, that's not an ubuntu-specific question.  i think you'll have better luck asking somewhere else
11:08	<delire>	maple: how far does it get?
11:08	<Snake007uk>	eobanb thanks :)

11:08	<ProN00b>	how can i stop all that printing stuff from opening ports ?

11:08	<ubotu>	For an easy to use custom sources.list creator, visit http://ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
11:08	<RandolphCarter>	Bizzeh: failing that, you could put it somewhere on the RAM disk, and force X to use that config (I know this is a lot of effort, but ATI detection kinda sucks)
11:08	<Bizzeh>	xanavim: so, wasting more money, because ubuntu doesnt lable their iso's properly, and doesnt cater to their users needs
11:08	<delire>	grasshopper: just enter whether you want an automatically generated IP wtih DHCP or whatever. as you would in windows of macintosh OS's.
11:08	<[zero] >	eobanb: so it doesnt auto?
11:08	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: are you trolling in here or what?!?!
11:08	<scifi>	ive just rebooted after upgrading to dapper and my xserver failed, can anyone help ?
11:08	<nnz>	what filesystem cdrom's use? iso9660?
11:08	<RandolphCarter>	yes nnz
11:09	<delire>	grasshopper: not if you don't have one.
11:09	<pandamonium>	Snake007uk, i had some problems with getting 1280x1024 resolution and i found that by opting for 'medium' rather than advanced in the config setup it worked
11:09	<maple>	delire: the progress bar gets all the way accross then i guess it tries to start x but nothing happens. no errors. but i can type into the screen. kinda wierd.
11:09	<richard>	!wlan
11:09	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: how is a cd a waste of money?  they're what, $0.20
11:09	<Bizzeh>	xanavim: no, im trying to figure out why people wont take on that the livecd is read only and you cannot write to it
11:09	<ubotu>	richard: No idea, try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/

11:09	<pandamonium>	dunno if it's any help to you though. my system just does what it wants to anyway
11:09	<eobanb>	Bizzeh, let us know what we can do about that and we'll do it, until then, please stop
11:09	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: you can't write to a burned cd

11:09	<grasshopper>	delire; ok but it doesn't work, that what i'm trying to say
11:09	<eobanb>	welcome, meads.
11:09	<RandolphCarter>	Bizzeh: did you try 'sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf' ?
11:09	<[zero] >	someone pasted it to me before
11:10	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, you were good help before.. how do you install drivers?
11:10	<meads>	Can someone tell me how i can take a screenshot in XFCE, so used to ksnapshot hehe
11:10	<RandolphCarter>	it can't all be read only, that Just Wouldn't Work (TM)
11:10	<eobanb>	[zero] , you can do that through System >	Administration >	Disks
11:10	<pandamonium>	paulproteus, did you get the link ok?
11:10	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: what's up?
11:10	<penguinwhoflew>	hello
11:10	<maple>	delire: im on f8 when i can type. f2-7 dont do anything. but i can go back to f1 and it shows Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
11:10	<kermitX_>	meads: there's a panel applet that takes screenies.
11:10	<nnz>	how to make apt-get update to work ?
11:10	<blaze>	how to remove something i've compiled make and make installed myslef?
11:10	<Bizzeh>	eobanb: 1. lable livecd's, as livecd's, and keep installer cd's, and lable them as installer cd's. also, keep the text installer as a fallback, for people who have cards that need a driver you dont supply
11:10	<eobanb>	blaze, with rm ..?
11:10	<grasshopper>	delire; actually, "direct internet connection" was ticked
11:10	<meads>	How do i access it KermitX_? it is installed as ynaptic says so :)
11:10	<NoUse>	kane777 did you change your /etc/apt/sources.list and then run apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade?
11:10	<pizux>	is it normal the time to wait during install = looking at the mirors?
11:10	<blaze>	no, from source eobanb
11:10	<DBO>	blaze, did you remember to install it to /opt/ ?
11:10	<dsas>	blaze: if you still have the source directory/makefile do "sudo make uninstall"
11:11	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, im going to install a driver for my davicom ethernet adapter... and i know how to get the drivers.. i just need to know which one to download and which one to install
11:11	<delire>	grasshopper: just play around, you'll get there.
11:11	<blaze>	ok :)
11:11	<penguinwhoflew>	quick question, when booting off the dapper release CD and installing, do i have the option then of formatting a drive?
11:11	<blaze>	dsas, i'll try
11:11	<Ademan>	k when you edit # defoptions=quiet splash       line from /boot/grub/menu.lst  what do you have to do to for it to take effect?
11:11	<grasshopper>	delire; it should be ticked for 'automatic'?
11:11	<scifi>	ive just rebooted after upgrading to dapper and my xserver failed, can anyone help ?
11:11	<eobanb>	Bizzeh, there is in fact a text-mode install disc
11:11	<delire>	maple: hmm..
11:11	<xanavim>	penguinwhoflew: yes
11:11	<penguinwhoflew>	thank you!
11:11	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, http://www.davicom.com.tw/eng/download/Driver/driver_9102a.htm    which one would i use for dapper?
11:11	<Snake007uk>	pandamonium cheers dude. ill check that up
11:11	<grasshopper>	delire; i'm not getting there! are  you delirious?
11:11	<penguinwhoflew>	now i'm off to install linux for the first time
11:11	<penguinwhoflew>	bye
11:11	<delire>	grasshopper: try automatic everything if you have a standard connection to a router where the router gives you an IP
11:11	<NoUse>	Wes the "desktop" CD is a live CD installer,if you want to do a text mode install you need the Alternate install CD
11:11	<Bizzeh>	eobanb: is the text based installer on the cd i have, as a fallback for the gui one, not working
11:11	<MyNameIsNotBob>	anyone here use skype with linux?
11:11	<eobanb>	Bizzeh, the liveCD has a graphical installer, which makes it the preferred way to install ubuntu.  just get try to get used to the paradigm of having a single CD instead of two CDs
11:11	<scifi>	can neone read this ? lol
11:11	<maple>	delire: thats what i was thinking. like i said this is the x86 disc, im contemplating getting the amd64 one but i assume ill have the same issue after having to dload the huge iso
11:11	<eobanb>	MyNameIsNotBob, yes, i have.
11:11	<DBO>	!skype
11:12	<ubotu>	hmm... skype is http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeHowto/ Breezy deb: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages/
11:12	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: while I figure this out, do 'sudo aptitude install linux-source'
11:12	<gfxstyler>	hey
11:12	<kermitX_>	meads: right click a panel and add. look for the screen shooter. it's in the package xfce4-screenshooter-plugin
11:12	<gfxstyler>	i need some help with fglrx (ati radeon) again :/
11:12	<eobanb>	MyNameIsNotBob, skype is very easy to install on dapper
11:12	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, im not connected to the internet right now.. can i still do it???
11:12	<grasshopper>	delire; what is the autoconfiguration URL it asks for when i have it ticked to 'automatic' please  :D
11:12	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: and the driver you'll need to download is http://www.davicom.com.tw/big5/download/Driver/dm9102a/dmfe_1.43.tar.gz
11:12	<gfxstyler>	(EE) Failed to load module "GLcore"     < in /var/log/Xorg.0.log, what could cause this ?
11:12	<kermitX_>	meads: if you also have gnome desktop installed. you can also look under accessories in the menu for the gnome one, and that works too.
11:12	<MyNameIsNotBob>	eobanb, i have it installed, just a problem is occuring with my sound
11:12	<eobanb>	!tell MyNameIsNotBob about sound
11:13	<blaze>	dsas, 10x, i think it's working.. i'll see in a second for sure :)
11:13	<sorush20>	hi guys
11:13	<meads>	I got it KermitX_, thank you so  much :) i now have a camera icon in my panel :) ill test it now
11:13	<sorush20>	gaybrial
11:13	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: nope :/ you'll need the source/headers on the machine to build that driver (kernel  module)
11:13	<blaze>	dsas, yes :)
11:13	<scifi>	gnomefreak: can u help ?
11:13	<nnz>	whats wrong with repositories ? can soumeone help .. trying to apt-get update says failed :/

11:13	<spire>	How do I make subsection numbering appear as 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, etc. instead of just 1, 2 and 3 in openoffice? (Selecting "header 2" just results in the 1, 2, 3 numbering...)
11:13	<NoUse>	nnz what repos are you trying to use?
11:14	<jorgp>	has the dapper cd artwork been released?
11:14	<pandamonium>	nnz, are you getting any can't resolve http errors?
11:14	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, can i do 'sudo aptitude install linux-source' without having an internet connection
11:14	<scifi>	ive just rebooted after upgrading to dapper and my xserver failed, can anyone help ?
11:14	<grasshopper>	GUYS! in NEtwork Proxy, when yyou have 'automatic' ticked it asks for an URL. What Url do i put in there and where do i get it?
11:14	<eobanb>	h3h_timo, if you have an ubuntu CD around, i believe so
11:14	<munckfish>	scifi: when you say it failed what are the symptoms?
11:14	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: no :/ you can download the package from http://packages.ubuntu.com/ (click on Dapper) and transfer it via cd-rw/floppy though
11:14	<nnz>	NoUse: im getting connetion failed
11:14	<nnz>	to ip
11:15	<Jowi>	nnz: they are very busy, at least the ones that I use (fr.archive). can take over a minute for me to get a connection when it is usually instantanious.
11:15	<NoUse>	nnz yes but I asked which repo you are pointing to
11:15	<eobanb>	grasshopper, i assume you put in the URL for your proxy.  if you don't use a proxy, then don't put anything there
11:15	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: you'll need a lot more packages from the internet too though, things like build-essential, debhelper and gcc
11:15	<grasshopper>	anyone know what autoconfiguration URL means?
11:15	<nnz>	gb.acrhive.ubuntu.com
11:15	<nnz>	and archive.ubuntu.com

11:15	<nnz>	yes
11:16	<grasshopper>	eobanb; how do i know if i use proxy? DHCP used to just do it automatically
11:16	<Junior_>	holy crap
11:16	<wrtpeeps>	how do i set the resolution to 1280x1024. It isnt on the list of available ones
11:16	<eobanb>	grasshopper, i doubt you're using a proxy
11:16	<wrtpeeps>	?
11:16	<eobanb>	grasshopper, just forget about that
11:16	<Junior_>	somebody help out a windows wheeny?
11:16	<eobanb>	wrtpeeps, what graphics card do you have
11:16	<eobanb>	Junior_, ...??
11:16	<NoUse>	nnz can you reach those URLS from your web browser?
11:16	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, i only found it in "devel"
11:16	<Jowi>	ubotu: tell wrtpeeps about resolution
11:16	<munckfish>	where did it fail in the startup process? If you want the xlog you can find it under /var/log I'm not on Linux at the mo as I think it's Xorg0.log or similar name
11:16	<majd>	hey
11:16	<wrtpeeps>	eobanb: nvidia geforce 6800gs
11:16	<eobanb>	welcome, majd.
11:16	<grasshopper>	eobanb; how do i save configuration so i don't have to use commandlinde to get online everytime i do a fresh bootup
11:16	<pandamonium>	ok
11:16	<eobanb>	!tell wrtpeeps about nvidia
11:17	<majd>	i installed the sun-java5-bin package, yet when i run java -version in the terminal i get: gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.1.0 (Ubuntu 4.1.0-1ubuntu8)
11:17	<wrtpeeps>	1280x1024 is my monitors native res
11:17	<spire>	NoUse: I don't understand. I need the "header 2" style to format its numbering as <section>.<subsection>. How do I do that in Bullets&Numbering?
11:17	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: oops, sorry :/ I don't tend to install this from the site
11:17	<majd>	and when i run java -jar LimeWire.jar i get an AWT error
11:17	<nnz>	NoUse yes , from a windows box
11:17	<grasshopper>	eobanb; what do you recommend i have ticked in Network Proxy so my computer picks up on eth0?
11:17	<nnz>	cant form ubuntu coz its server install
11:17	<Crane>	wrtpeeps, you should also verify the monitor will handle it. Then set the resolutions to match your monitors in the xorg
11:17	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, its alright.. umm do i have to download each package??
11:17	<eobanb>	grasshopper, do you have two network cards or something?
11:17	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: and each packages dependencies :/
11:17	<grasshopper>	no
11:17	<nnz>	but they do ping from ubuntu
11:18	<scifi>	munckfish: it seemed ubuntu had finished booting, all the drivers loaded etc, then just at the point where the splash screen wud appear thats when it failed
11:18	<eobanb>	grasshopper, all you should have to do is enable eth0, with dhcp, don't enable anything else, and it should work
11:18	<grasshopper>	eobanb; no, why?
11:18	<Junior_>	can one of you guys tell me how to install a program in ubuntu?
11:18	<munckfish>	scifi: I recognise that then - that happens to me on my laptop
11:18	<eobanb>	!tell Junior_ about apt
11:18	<grasshopper>	eobanb; how do i enable eth0 with dhcp?
11:18	<gnomefreak>	Junior_: what program

11:18	<Junior_>	sorry I'm a total noob to linux
11:18	<Grunt>	are there any instructions for installing ruby on the rails in dapper?
11:18	<grasshopper>	eobanb; dhcp used to do it for me autojmatically in breezy, but since upgrading to dapper it doesnt
11:19	<eobanb>	Junior_, folding is on the folding website, just download it and run the script to install it, just follow the instructions on folding's site.  wine is in the repository as usual
11:19	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell Junior_ -about wine
11:19	<nnz>	NoUse how can i check from command line ? they do ping .. should i wget ?
11:19	<pandamonium>	is knode available in any of the repositories?
11:19	<azurehuesofblue>	how do you run a pl file?
11:19	<scifi>	munckfish: Geforece 4 ti4400, bare in mind that the nv option i used in previous xserver config worked fine for breezy
11:19	<gnomefreak>	Junior_: your pm will tell you about wine as for the other one never heard of it
11:19	<popey>	azurehuesofblue: perl file.pl
11:19	<grasshopper>	eobanb; i have to go to commandline and ifconfig eth0 up and then dhclient to get online
11:19	<NoUse>	nnz you don't have gnome running?
11:19	<eobanb>	azurehuesofblue, that's a perl script.  # perl /path/to/file.pl
11:19	<revmouse>	Is there any way to remove all the software that was installed with kubuntu-desktop? I really prefer ubuntu-desktop
11:19	<Junior_>	ok cool, I'll read thru the PM and if I have any more questions I'll get back to you, thanks guys
11:19	<azurehuesofblue>	ok so just type perl first?
11:19	<nnz>	no
11:20	<eobanb>	yes, azurehuesofblue
11:20	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: I've just looked at the code for that module, and it seems you'll only need the linux kernel-headers (they're in a much smaller package)
11:20	<pgquiles>	does Dapper include XGL?
11:20	<azurehuesofblue>	thanks
11:20	<eobanb>	pgquiles, not by default
11:20	<Tom__>	hi all, need make and g++ in DapperDrake, what packages do I neet, i'm new to ubuntu
11:20	<scifi>	munckfish: ive never used this irssi before, so dont know how to "minimize" it and search for log in cli
11:20	<nnz>	i just wgeted archive.ubuntu.com/.../source/Sources.gz , but apt cant get jack..
11:20	<ProN00b>	can i somehow disable cupsys and hplip, or do i have to resort to /etc/init.d/ haxxoring ?
11:20	<grasshopper>	eobanb; please help me
11:20	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, so what exactly do i download then?
11:20	<nnz>	what wrong
11:20	<eobanb>	pgquiles, for questions about xgl, ask in #ubuntu-xgl
11:20	<revmouse>	Tom__: try installing build-essentials
11:20	<eobanb>	grasshopper, i'm not sure how to fix your problem.
11:20	<luis_>	will truetype fonts work if I put them inside a '.fonts' folder inside the home directory?
11:20	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, this ?? http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/devel/linux-kernel-headers
11:20	<Tom__>	thanks revmouse
11:20	<dunnix>	hello everyone
11:20	<eobanb>	grasshopper, you might try asking tomorrow when it will (hopefully) be less crazy here.
11:20	<grasshopper>	eobanb;   :|
11:20	<nickm__>	are there any ubuntu podcasts?
11:20	<crimsun>	linux-kernel-headers is for glibc, which is /not/ what you want.
11:21	<munckfish>	scifi: ok in that case I'm not sure how to help cause I have an ATI card had to do this, http://munckfish.net/blog/archive/2006/02/07/ubuntu-on-acer-aspire-9500/, to fix it for breezy seems I have to do the same for dapper. Need someone with your card to relate their experiences.
11:21	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: yes, that, for i386.  you'll need gcc and 'make' too
11:21	<ryanakca>	is paste.ubuntu-nl.org down?
11:21	<popey>	grasshopper: have you looked at the settings in System -->	Admin -->	Networking ?
11:21	<grasshopper>	eobanb; hahaha...you think it'll have cooled down by then?
11:21	<nickm__>	ryanakca: i think so
11:21	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, alright let me find them
11:21	<Crane>	wrtpeeps, check and compare you vert and horz freg settings in xorg.conf
11:21	<pgquiles>	eobanb thanks
11:21	<munckfish>	scifi: have you checked your X log?
11:21	<Crane>	make sure they match your monitors soecs
11:21	<NoUse>	nnz just run 'wget <URL>'
11:21	<Crane>	specs
11:21	<neutrinomass>	ryanakca: Yeah, so it seems.
11:21	<rata>	hi
11:21	<nnz>	why apt-get says cant connect to archive.ubuntu.com ? even if i can ping and wget from it?
11:21	<scifi>	munckfish: i dont know how to get out of this irssi to check it
11:21	<lazzarello>	would it be possible to use debootstrap from dapper to install debian on a CF card?
11:21	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, and i need each of their dependencies too??
11:22	<nnz>	NoUse just did and i could get sources.gz
11:22	<popey>	nnz: might be better to use a geographically closer source?
11:22	<NoUse>	nnz do you run through a proxy?
11:22	<grasshopper>	popey; nice! no i hadn't. I was told to look in Network Proxy
11:22	<nnz>	NoUse nope
11:22	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: yes, gcc only depends on cpp and gcc-4.0
11:22	<scifi>	munckfish: im using this cli chat because obviously i have no xserver :P
11:22	<nickm__>	no one knows any ubuntu podcasts?
11:22	<munckfish>	scifi: when the screen goes blank Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get into the first pseudo terminal, then you can login and find the log from the command line
11:22	<screamz>	how can I reconfigure my sound ? it s not working anymore after the upgrade
11:22	<grasshopper>	popey; but this is different. Do you know how to configure this? IP address etc
11:22	<nnz>	popey what would u recomend for europe?
11:22	<luis_>	will truetype fonts work if I put them inside a '.fonts' folder inside the home directory?
11:22	<scifi>	munckfish: ty will try
11:22	<rata>	I am triying to change locales to a server using dapper, but dpkg-reconfigure doesn't do the trick, what could be happening ?
11:22	<Jimmey__>	How can I put files into a smb:// directory through the command line?
11:23	<h3h_timo>	do cpp and gcc-4.0 depend on anything?
11:23	<eobanb>	h3h_timo, basically everything you'll need is going to be in ubuntu's repositories.
11:23	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: hmm, and they depend on a lot of other stuff :/ I think this would be a compelling argument for including at least build-essential on the install cd
11:23	<belkin>	hi all
11:23	<popey>	grasshopper: set it to dhcp, and make sure the interface is "active"
11:23	<belkin>	from here do i get the net install cd ?
11:23	<rata>	sorry, dpkg-reconfigure locales :)
11:23	<belkin>	i couldnt find it anywhere
11:23	<popey>	belkin: there isn't a net install cd
11:23	<revmouse>	nickm__: http://ubuntuos.com/podcast/
11:23	<screamz>	aplay: device_list:221: no soundcards found...
11:23	<RandolphCarter>	eobanb: the problem is we're downloading these to build a kernel module for his network card ;)
11:23	<eobanb>	h3h_timo, with apt you don't have to worry about manually resolving dependencies, just sudo apt-get build-essential and that will install gcc and everything else you need for you
11:23	<nickm__>	thanks revmouse
11:23	<Blissex>	luis_: depends on which font system you want to make them available under. For FontConfig that is good if you run 'fc-cache' after
11:23	<RandolphCarter>	eobanb: and in this case, unfortunately, we do
11:23	<pandamonium>	rata, is it locales or locale?
11:23	<Xenguy>	Hi - I have successfully upgraded from Breezy->Dapper.  The only glitch is that whereas before a Gnome desktop was loaded, now an XFCE4 desktop is loaded.  Can any one tell me why this may have happened, and is there a simple fix?
11:24	<scifi>	munckfish: ctrl+alt+f1 dont seem to be doing nething for me :P
11:24	<rata>	pandamonium, tha package is locales
11:24	<gnomefreak>	Xenguy: did you have xfce to begin with?
11:24	<eobanb>	Xenguy, did you install xubuntu-desktop?
11:24	<luis_>	Blissex, well I want them to be available to my current user, they are windows xp's truetype
11:24	<xanavim>	Xenguy: yes, there's a simple fix
11:24	<Jimmey__>	Xenguy, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop; sudo apt-get --purge remove xubuntu-desktop
11:24	<ryanakca>	Seveas: You're in charge of ubuntu-nl.org ?
11:24	<belkin>	popey really ? so there is no way i can download only 100 mb to boot and install ubuntu from there ?
11:24	<SurfnKid>	amonia?
11:24	<popey>	Xenguy: at the logon screen click "options -->	session" and choose gnome
11:24	<gnomefreak>	Xenguy: just change defaul in sessions on the login screen
11:24	<_libra_>	Hi, do u know about any wireless presenter ubuntu-compatible? pls
11:24	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, so what should i do?
11:24	<Xenguy>	gnomefreak: Yes, but I had GNOME configured as default desktop.
11:24	<Tom__>	@revmouse: do u know how the build-essential-Package named in a german installation?
11:24	<popey>	belkin: correct
11:24	<pandamonium>	rata, ok... it's just that i tried both and i can't remember which one worked for me
11:24	<Seveas>	ryanakca, yes and I know it's doen
11:24	<screamz>	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device <= can someone direct me to some troubleshooting?
11:24	<Seveas>	down*
11:24	<munckfish>	scifi: hmmm maybe it's something more serious then. Usually I can get into pseudo term if X isn't conf'd quite right
11:24	<xanavim>	Xenguy: it's easy to switch it back
11:25	<rata>	pandamonium, with dapper ?
11:25	<eobanb>	belkin, if you have limited bandwidth, you can get a CD shipped to you for free
11:25	<grasshopper>	popey; ok, set it to dhcp. HOw do i make sure the interface is active?
11:25	<eobanb>	!tell belkin about shipit
11:25	<revmouse>	Tom__: I would assume it would still be build-essentials
11:25	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: pm
11:25	<pandamonium>	rata, in general
11:25	<popey>	grasshopper: on the previous screen there is an "activate" button :)
11:25	<gnomefreak>	hold on Seveas i got one for use until your is up
11:25	<nnz>	am i alone getting this strange apt problems?
11:25	<ryanakca>	Seveas: kk.... who was it again who is in charge of web board? I want to change pastebin servers... I just don't know how to in kde
11:25	<rata>	pandamonium, in general work, but no with dapper :)
11:25	<eobanb>	revmouse, the package name is build-essential, not build-essentials
11:25	<belkin>	eobanb no thanks  ;)
11:25	<Murrlin>	good afternoon all
11:25	<munckfish>	scifi: only time I've not been able to get into a term was when I had the vert/horiz refresh rate wrong
11:25	<Xenguy>	brb
11:25	<SurfnKid>	gday Murrlin
11:25	<revmouse>	eobanb: oops
11:25	<pandamonium>	rata, sorry mate, don't know about dapper
11:25	<Heartsbane>	What no more #ubuntu+1 with the 6.06 release? http://www.ubuntu.com/news/606released?
11:25	<curuptura>	good day commander
11:25	<grampajoe>	Is installing the nvidia drivers in dapper different from breezy?
11:25	<xanavim>	nnz: no, there are lots of apt problems which can be resolved easily
11:25	<gnomefreak>	ryanakca: right click the panel icon
11:25	<rata>	pandamonium, lot of thanks anyway :)
11:26	<popey>	Heartsbane: it will come when edgy opens
11:26	<Tom__>	didn't find it, maybe I should use aptitude?
11:26	<eobanb>	Heartsbane, 6.06 is the current version as of today.  ubuntu+1 is now for edgy eft
11:26	<scifi>	munckfish: i just tried ctrl+alt+f2 and get into terminal :)
11:26	<nnz>	xanavim easily ? please say how
11:26	<Murrlin>	hehe no thanks, water'll do
11:26	<munckfish>	scifi: ah great! well done
11:26	<ryanakca>	gnomefreak: I'm in kde... of course... I should be asking in #kubuntu, but nobody there uses it...
11:26	<gnomefreak>	Seveas: http://gnomefreak.pastebin.com/
11:26	<grasshopper>	popey; yea, saw that, but it doesn't highlight and doesn't respond  to clickin on ?
11:26	<Tom__>	@revmouse: didn't find it, maybe I should use aptitude?
11:26	<xanavim>	nnz: what kind of problem is it?
11:26	<popey>	grasshopper: is the interface already active? did you highlight the interface on the left first?
11:26	<gnomefreak>	ryanakca: last i tried webboard didnt work from menu you had to make icon for it
11:26	<azurehuesofblue>	I'm trying to install vmware player on my machine and it wont find the make program on my machine, where would that be?
11:26	<pandamonium>	i need another beer. can i configure ubuntu to go to the fridge for me? :p
11:27	<ryanakca>	gnomefreak: webboard-applet doesnt work in kde.... you run it threw alt-f2, webboard...
11:27	<eobanb>	pandamonium, serious questions only please.
11:27	<nnz>	xanavim cant update to archive. or gs.archive  says connection failed
11:27	<SurfnKid>	pandamonium, thats in the works i think
11:27	<dsas>	azurehuesofblue: you need to install build-essential
11:27	<Jimmey__>	azurehuesofblue, sudo apt-get install build-essential
11:27	<popey>	azurehuesofblue: i think you need the build-essential and make packages
11:27	<SurfnKid>	:P
11:27	<eobanb>	azurehuesofblue, sudo apt-get install build-essential
11:27	<intelikey>	quick Q  how to "un-register" from launchpad ?
11:27	<nnz>	even if i can wget form that location
11:27	<gnomefreak>	ryanakca: that i would check ~/.webboard
11:27	<xanavim>	nnz: can you ping the servers that you put in your repos?
11:27	<dsas>	azurehuesofblue: You should be able to install it from within ubuntu rather than compiling yourself.
11:27	<pandamonium>	eobanb, sorry, was just having a lighthearted banter
11:27	<dhonn>	anyone know what server kernel is optimzed for K8 arch?
11:27	<nnz>	xanavim yes , i can wget files from them
11:27	<grampajoe>	Is there anything different about installing Nvidia drivers in dapper?
11:28	<scifi>	munckfish: what command line program can i use to open the log file ?
11:28	<nnz>	but apt-get update doesnt work
11:28	<grasshopper>	popey: dunno, gonna go and try it.  :o
11:28	<eobanb>	grampajoe, 'different'?
11:28	<azurehuesofblue>	Thanks all.
11:28	<xanavim>	nnz: try removing some of the repos one by one until it works, then put them back in again one by one until you find the problem one
11:28	<intelikey>	<nnz sudo
11:28	<rata>	pandamonium, btw, i found it. In dapper there is an other package called localeconf fot doing that :)
11:28	<popey>	dhonn: linux-image-2.6.15-23-k7
11:28	<dhonn>	thats k7
11:28	<pandamonium>	rata, :)
11:28	<revmouse>	Tom__: try build-essential    sorry for the misinformation
11:28	<eobanb>	!info linux-image
11:28	<xanavim>	nnz: you can also try different mirrors
11:28	<munckfish>	scifi: easiest is 'less'. so type 'less <logfilename>'
11:28	<popey>	dhonn: and above
11:28	<eobanb>	weh.
11:28	<nnz>	intelikey im under root so no need for sudo
11:28	<grampajoe>	eobanb, I tried installing nvidia-glx and nvidia-settings like the ubuntu website says, but it won't let me install them both, just one or the other
11:29	<dhonn>	but k8 exists in apt
11:29	<scifi>	munckfish: ty
=== SurfnKid is now known as Sudo
11:29	<intelikey>	nnz   apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
11:29	<eobanb>	grampajoe, what error message are you getting
11:29	<popey>	dhonn: where?
11:29	<VonGuard>	so then
11:29	<popey>	dhonn: I don't see it here
11:29	<crimsun>	dhonn: for server specifically, linux-image-2.6.15-23-amd64-server
11:29	<dhonn>	linux-image-2.6.15-23-amd64-k8
11:29	<grampajoe>	eobanb, It's not an error message, it just tells me I have to remove nvidia-glx if I want to install nvidia-settings
11:29	<popey>	dhonn: ahh, you have amd64?
11:29	<pandamonium>	at least my printer works
=== ingo is now known as ingo|away
11:29	<dhonn>	linux-image-2.6.15-23-amd64-server-k8 though doesnt exist
11:29	<munckfish>	scifi: np. sorry I have to quit now. hope you get on alright. bye!
11:30	<xanavim>	dhonn: I thought it as k6 or k7
11:30	<nnz>	apt always says connection failed
11:30	<xanavim>	*was*
11:30	<Sudo>	pandamonium, what kind HP?
11:30	<nnz>	wtf damn it

11:30	<Sudo>	eww how was the setup
11:30	<gnomefreak>	untill*
11:30	<xanavim>	nnz: try changing your mirrors
11:30	<crimsun>	dhonn: you asked for a server specifically, so yes
11:30	<nnz>	xanavim to which?
11:30	<pandamonium>	ubuntu is the first distro that didn't require extensive tweaking
11:30	<grasshopper>	hi
11:30	<xanavim>	ubotu: tell nnz about mirrors
11:30	<dhonn>	but amd64 optimized for xeons or amds

=== Sudo is now known as SurfnKid
11:32	<dhonn>	linux-image-2.6.15-23-amd64-k8 is also a desktop kernel
11:32	<rata>	pandamonium, but i think i found it a bug
11:32	<scifi>	munckfish: "couldnt open module "nvidia" and direory font/cyrillis does not exist are some of several errors
11:32	<SurfnKid>	hehe
11:32	<nnz>	this "dapper main restricted" should always be after url ?

11:33	<nnz>	still says connection failed
11:33	<crimsun>	dhonn: are you looking for server kernels specifically?
11:33	<gnomefreak>	ryanakca: thats  agood question look for it in nautilus
11:33	<xanavim>	nnz: did you sudo apt-get update?
11:33	<scifi>	munckfish: its currently set to "generic" driver, so maybe try changing that to "nv" ?
11:33	<crimsun>	dhonn: then use linux-image-2.6.15-23-amd64-server
11:33	<dhonn>	server kernel optimized for k8
11:33	<nnz>	yes im doing it right now
11:33	<pandamonium>	i see, dapper is a nuance of the ubuntu flavour of linux?
11:33	<nnz>	cant even connect to my local servers
11:33	<eobanb>	pandamonium, dapper is the latest, and current, version of ubuntu.
11:33	<scifi>	munckfish: is there someway i can paste the log to pastebin via irssi ?

11:39	<JonnyBoy>	eobanb: i tried that, but it said that x-server-xorg is not installed
11:39	<nbx909>	eobanb, seems like something that should work
11:40	<delire>	meads: use audacity
11:40	<Blissex>	luis_: you can use your XP fonts more or less on that way but to do it properly is hard work.
11:40	<leboff>	delire: i'm lookin for something gui
11:40	<nbx909>	usb logitec
11:40	<meads>	Thank Delire
11:40	<nnz>	could someone please give me an url to openssh-server.deb or whatever to install an sshd coz i'we been doin it for 2 hours now or so , and done nothing , and apt scks
11:40	<eobanb>	JonnyBoy, that's because the package is xserver-xorg, not x-server-xorg
11:40	<jacob_>	hey
11:40	<gnomefreak>	iso and server md5s match the cd md5.txt doesnt show mine
11:40	<Raozine>	umm.. how do I enable russian(cyrillic) characters to show up in rhythmbox and in the file manager?
11:40	<eobanb>	JonnyBoy, you must type the EXACT command for it to work

11:40	<glxblt>	um.. my windows drives' owner is root, so I can't touch them with my user

11:40	<penguinwhoflew>	ummm... what if after installing ubuntu the only thing that comes up is 'error loading operating system'?
11:41	<pandamonium>	i've noticed some of the docs in the wiki could do with a bit of cleaning up re: grammar etc. i reckon i could do a job there. how would i get started?
11:41	<paniq>	snusnubuntu
11:41	<nbx909>	eobanb, no i guess that would be a good idea lol
11:41	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell grampajoe about nvidia
11:41	<dsas>	pandamonium: see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam
11:41	<nbx909>	eobanb, but he will want to use this mouse evetually
11:41	<davmor2>	has anyone got bonfire to install on x86-64 bit yet?  If so how please.
11:41	<delire>	leboff: right, i'm not too up-to-date with that area. you could try kmediafactory
11:41	<ryanakca>	gnomefreak: you need to edit it in gconf-editor
11:41	<paniq>	ubuntusnu?
11:41	<gnomefreak>	brb gonna test
11:41	<dsas>	pandamonium: The Doc Team look after the wiki and the system help
11:41	<leboff>	delire: thanks.. ill look into it
11:41	<gnomefreak>	ryanakca: oh ok
11:41	<gnomefreak>	brb
11:41	<eobanb>	nbx909, that's fine, but just see if other USB or PS/2 mice work first
11:41	<octan>	do anyone know how i do renice a app?
11:41	<JonnyBoy>	how do i know which video card driver i supposed to select?
11:41	<SurfnKid>	!nvidia
11:41	<ubotu>	Help about installing the nVidia drivers on Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
11:41	<eobanb>	nbx909, do other USB peripherals work?
11:41	<pandamonium>	cheers
11:42	<paniq>	!easyubuntu
11:42	<scifi>	ive just rebooted after upgrading to dapper and my xserver failed, can anyone help ?
11:42	<nbx909>	eobanb, no idea let me see
11:42	<ubotu>	hmm... easyubuntu is an easy-to-use program for installing all your favorites. Java, Nvidia/ATI, and more. It is as safe as the team can make it. It doesn't change any settings by default. http://easyubuntu.freecontrib.org/.
11:42	<penguinwhoflew>	anybody...? i bought a 200gb drive today just to install linux and all i get is 'error loading operating system'. a more vague error i could not wish for...
11:42	<mloman>	how do i set the dnsdomainname in ubuntu?
11:42	<Oldak>	I'm using the Ubuntu LiveCD but don't know the su password... Can anyone help?
11:42	<eobanb>	penguinwhoflew, that's probably a BIOS message, not an ubuntu one
11:42	<Raozine>	How do I enable russian(cyrillic) characters to show up in rhythmbox and in the file manager?
11:42	<popey>	penguinwhoflew: is this the only drive in the pc?
11:42	<penguinwhoflew>	no
11:42	<MENDIGO>	i need help, when I run a VCD on Mplayer, the screen is too small, and when i click on "double size" or "full screen" it doesn't change at all, the only thing that happens is that the windows gets bigger, a black space around the litlle screen
11:42	<dhonn>	no, thats not what i mean theres linux-image-*-amd64-generic that covers both, then there is linux-image-*-amd64-k8 and linux-image-*-amd64-xeon that are for specific desktop archs, but on the server side there is just a generic amd64 kernel for both amd and intel
11:42	<scifi>	would it be safe to replace current xserver.conf with my saved conf from breezy install ?
11:42	<crimsun>	Oldak: there is no su passwd.
11:42	<popey>	penguinwhoflew: have you gone through the ubuntu installation?
11:42	<penguinwhoflew>	popey: yes
11:43	<nnz>	please someone give a full url to openssh-server.deb
11:43	<crimsun>	dhonn: yes, that's intentional
11:43	<xanavim>	Oldak: try using sudo instead
11:43	<Oddie>	I have just installed ubuntu server and im unable to connect through ssh from windows. Ubuntu is 5.10... is there any firewall on default with the server addition?
11:43	<anthony>	what's the difference between the package totem and totem-xine
11:43	<penguinwhoflew>	popey:  and with it i told it the right drive to format, and to use full space
11:43	<eobanb>	scifi, probably.  if it doesnt end up working you can always just switch it back.
11:43	<nnz>	why ubuntu server cd would install without opensshd?
11:43	<wastrel>	penguinwhoflew:  when do you get that error?
11:43	<popey>	penguinwhoflew: did it ask you where to put the MBR?
11:43	<crimsun>	anthony: totem is a metapackage that depends on either totem-gstreamer or totem-xine.
11:43	<SurfnKid>	and i thought I had issues
11:43	<eobanb>	Oddie, is sshd running on it?
11:43	<NoUse>	nnz dapper or breezy?
11:43	<penguinwhoflew>	wastrel: when booting off the installed drive, and popey: no
11:43	<dsas>	nnz: No ports open by default.
11:43	<xanavim>	nnz: to leave a potential security hole closed
11:43	<nnz>	dapper
11:43	<delire>	scifi: it should be. why not backup your existing one first and give it a go?
11:43	<Oddie>	sshd is running... should be
11:43	<ellidokuz207>	bu ne yaw
11:43	<scifi>	eobanb: nechance of remind me of the replace command line ?
11:44	<eobanb>	Oddie, please double-check anyway.
11:44	<nnz>	yeah and to make me waste lots of time by makin apt to work
11:44	<davmor2>	nnz: what is wrong with the ones in dapper?
11:44	<nnz>	nice job
11:44	<penguinwhoflew>	where do i fix the MBR at?
11:44	<octan>	Hello.. can anyine telll me howi  renice an running app?
11:44	<eobanb>	scifi, mv to move, cp to copy, rm to delete.

11:44	<JonnyBoy>	eobanb: how do i know which video card driver i supposed to select?
11:44	<scifi>	delire: if i do that the backup might replace the backup that i want to use lol
11:44	<NoUse>	nnz http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssh/openssh-server_4.2p1-7ubuntu3_i386.deb
11:44	<eobanb>	JonnyBoy, well what video card do you have?
11:44	<Oddie>	eobanb: i'll check
11:44	<JonnyBoy>	i dont know
11:44	<anthony>	is totem-xine just a command-line media player? or does that include the GUI too? do i have to install xine-ui on top of totem-xine and totem-xine-firefox-plugin?
11:44	<SurfnKid>	penguinwhoflew,  NT installed then Ubuntu?
11:44	<JonnyBoy>	what cmd do i use to check?
11:44	<nnz>	NoUse THANX!!!
11:44	<eobanb>	anthony, no, totem is in gtk
11:44	<crimsun>	anthony: it's a gui one
11:44	<eXistenZ>	eobanb, Did you find the details for installing ATI drivers for 9200?
11:45	<leboff>	delire: looks like kmediafactory is what i was lookin for, thanks!
11:45	<dhonn>	ok but shouldnt there be a two amd64 server kernels specifically targeted for amd or intel?
11:45	<jacob_>	does anyone know how to fix this error Details: Failed to execute child process "gksudo" (No such file or directory)
11:45	<penguinwhoflew>	SurfnKid: yes, but i installed ubuntu on a whole new fresh-outta-the-box drive
11:45	<anthony>	eobanb and crimsun: thanks
11:45	<eobanb>	eXistenZ, the 9200 needs only the included open source driver, called ati.
11:45	<xanavim>	nnz: compare your sources.list to this: http://pastebin.com/752263
11:45	<grampajoe>	When I try to run "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" to enable the nvidia drivers, I get an error message: "Error: your X configuration has been altered."
11:45	<SurfnKid>	oh I see
11:45	<jacob_>	hello

11:45	<SurfnKid>	it doesnt see it :S
11:45	<wastrel>	i'm downloading the dapper torrent
11:45	<SurfnKid>	that i need to research
11:45	<nbx909>	eobanb, he figured it out, he didn't have power going to the hub that he uses ><
11:46	<nbx909>	thanks
11:46	<delire>	octan:  renice <num>	<processID>	-u <users>	should do it
11:46	<MehAdult>	hi
11:46	<eobanb>	nbx909, it's never a good idea to plug a usb mouse into a usb hub
11:46	<MehAdult>	!tell MehAdult about ndiswrapper
11:46	<nbx909>	eobanb, why not?
11:46	<xanavim>	eobanb: why is that?
11:46	<penguinwhoflew>	SurfnKid: it sees the drive but when i double click it it says:
11:46	<davmor2>	nnz: yes there are install universe/multiverse and lo they are there to install
11:46	<penguinwhoflew>	error: device /dev/hdb1 is not removable
11:46	<penguinwhoflew>	error: could not execute pmount
11:46	<jacob_>	how do i fix gksudo
11:46	<JonnyBoy>	eobanb: Is there a command that I can type so I can find out what video card I have?
11:46	<jacob_>	it says its not there

11:46	<jacob_>	buntu-live
11:46	<jacob_>	JonnyBoy eobanb: what cmd do i use to check?
11:46	<jacob_>	eXistenZ eobanb, great, thanks ;)
11:46	<octan>	<delire>	is 20 the lowest?
11:46	<SurfnKid>	eobanb, or any device to any hub its a mess
11:46	<glxblt>	it seems that it mounts the drives for root
11:46	<glxblt>	so your user can't access them
11:46	<eobanb>	hollld up everyone
11:46	<xanavim>	eobanb: that's what a usb hub is *for*, and that's what the 2-6 ports on the back of a machine are
11:46	<penguinwhoflew>	glxblt: hooray! i'm not the only one... xD
11:46	<livevil>	Hi

11:47	<SurfnKid>	penguinwhoflew, keep asking someone will know :D
11:47	<glxblt>	penguinwhoflew: no idea, that's what I'm trying to find out
11:47	<MehAdult>	Can I install ndiswrapper for 6.0.4 if I just installed 6.0.6?
11:47	<eobanb>	scifi, it's in etc/X11/xorg.conf
11:47	<xanavim>	scifi: do you mean /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
11:47	<penguinwhoflew>	glxblt: awesome... haha, linux is fun...
11:47	<scifi>	eobanb: ty

11:47	<livevil>	!info frostwire

11:48	<crimsun>	JonnyBoy: lspci -v |egrep '(VGA|Display)'
11:48	<delire>	livevil: it's not in the repositories? if not 'sudo dpkg -i <package.deb>'
11:48	<crimsun>	MehAdult: recompile it
11:48	<SurfnKid>	I get a few tips from ppl here but the forum is packed with solutions, its just finding the right thread thats the hardest part
=== caplink811-log is now known as caplink811_log
11:48	<livevil>	delire it doesn't work
11:48	<penguinwhoflew>	ok why does 'su' have a password on a live cd...?
11:48	<MehAdult>	crimsun: How do I do that?
11:48	<livevil>	are different way to install it?
11:49	<dabaR>	SurfnKid: well, that is why we have the user guide, I think.
11:49	<delire>	livevil: more info required.
11:49	<eobanb>	!tell penguinwhoflew about sudo
11:49	<eobanb>	!tell penguinwhoflew about root
11:49	<Oddie>	eobanb: Thx for the ssh, all working now
11:49	<eobanb>	Oddie, glad to hear it./
11:49	<DShepherd>	does gparted resize ntfs non-destructively?
11:49	<SurfnKid>	dabar where is it at again?
11:49	<flossgeek>	Hi all, I have an issue with refresh rate, I can'y change it from the GUI, I have tried the dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg configuration and manually slected my resolution and then rebooted but still I have the same resolution. I should add that I am stuck at 75Hz and I want to reduce to 60Hz. Anyone know how can resolve this, I'd be grateful for your help?
11:49	<xanavim>	penguinwhoflew: su isn't turned on, that's just a secure way of keeping the wrong people out of your system
11:49	<dabaR>	SurfnKid: in your help menu
11:49	<crimsun>	MehAdult: the same way you did for the previous version, I presume
11:49	<xanavim>	penguinwhoflew: use sudo
11:49	<Nrbelex>	Hi, if my computer meets the min. specs but can't make it through the graphical install through the live CD, how do I go through the old style install?
11:49	<SurfnKid>	oh duh
11:49	<iNiku>	this howto claims grub cannot be used to boot an lvm/raid system, wonder if that's still true? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Installation/LVMOnRaid?highlight=%28lvm%29%7C%28install%29
11:49	<livevil>	when I write the command in the terminal, it answer that was impossible to find the deb file
11:49	<MehAdult>	crimsun: This is a brand new install.
11:49	<SurfnKid>	dabaR, and thru terminal
11:49	<crimsun>	DShepherd: yes, with the usual caveat to back up your data, etc.
11:49	<eobanb>	flossgeek, you could try editing your xorg.conf and setting the refresh rate to 60Hz manually.
11:49	<nbx909>	flossgeek, did you go into advanced to change the hz to 60?
11:49	<nnz>	god damn i make sshd to work , thank you all
11:50	<xanavim>	iNiku: check the latest grub docs
11:50	<nnz>	apt doesnt work still ehh
11:50	<flossgeek>	no medium
11:50	<DShepherd>	crimsun: hmmm ok
11:50	<dabaR>	SurfnKid: it is also online
11:50	<flossgeek>	nbx909: medium
11:50	<iNiku>	anyone know how seriously out of date that wiki page is?
11:50	<eobanb>	flossgeek, do advanced
11:50	<SurfnKid>	ah cool
11:50	<xanavim>	nnz: language
11:50	<crimsun>	MehAdult: why not just use the included ndiswrapper?
11:50	<MehAdult>	crimsun: But the .debs are for 6.0.4 and I'm wondering if it's safe.
11:50	<Xyloc>	Hello everyone
11:50	<MehAdult>	crimsun: I'm not sure it's installed.
11:50	<nbx909>	flossgeek, advanced allows you to select the exact one
11:50	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, no idea I thought it was updated
11:50	<Hentai_Jeff>	hmm looks like ACX111 still got jibed in dapper
11:50	<crimsun>	MehAdult: yes, it is
11:50	<xanavim>	MehAdult: 6.0.4 is 6.0.6 now
11:50	<flossgeek>	eobanb: I did do this and addded Horizontal and Vertical settings
11:50	<eobanb>	MehAdult, 6.04 is the same thing as 6.06
11:50	<crimsun>	MehAdult: you can find myriad instructions on the wiki/forum/...
11:50	<xanavim>	MehAdult: they're the same thing generally
11:50	<delire>	livevil: did you type the full path to the debian package and use the full name of that debian package? eg if i have a package called stuff.deb on the desktop i'd 'sudo dpkg -i /home/me/Desktop/stuff.deb'
11:50	<Xyloc>	When I upgraded to Dapper form Breezy, my Xorg didn't work anymore
11:50	<MehAdult>	I'm om winblows right now dual booting. So keep that in mind.
11:50	<eobanb>	MehAdult, it was just delayed for two months so the version number changed
11:50	<dhonn>	what is one line command to install lamp
11:51	<nbx909>	dhonn, there isn't
11:51	<MehAdult>	Ok. I got the debs on my harddrive.
11:51	<iNiku>	SurfnKid: it only mentions breezy but I'm not sure how different things are on dapper in that respect
11:51	<nbx909>	dhonn, that's only for the server edition
11:51	<eobanb>	nbx909, actually i think for some reason there is a metapackage
11:51	<Xyloc>	Does anyone know what command to use to reconfigure it Ubuntu-style?
11:51	<dhonn>	i thought it was mentioned on the website
11:51	<livevil>	I'll try again being careful on the adress wait...
11:51	<MehAdult>	It's on the link on the ubotu bot
11:51	<ucordes>	what can i do when i install dapper and forgot the password on first login ??
11:51	<nbx909>	eobanb, really? i could not find it for the wor;d
11:51	<penguinwhoflew>	hey i did it
11:51	<flossgeek>	eobanb: I added "HorizSync" "VertRefresh" settings
11:51	<xanavim>	dhonn: you install them separately, apache or apache 2, mysql, perl or php or python
11:51	<MehAdult>	ucordes: Reinstall?
11:51	<SurfnKid>	iNiku,  thatll work, Im on Breezy
11:51	<penguinwhoflew>	glxblt:
11:51	<dabaR>	!lamp
11:52	<nbx909>	ucordes, reinstall or boot up in recovery mode
11:52	<Jinkguns>	I have a question
11:52	<ucordes>	meadult: No way?
11:52	<dhonn>	arg lol, it differs greatly from the lamp installation of the server disk
11:52	<Raozine>	How do I enable russian(cyrillic) characters to show up in rhythmbox and in the file manager?
11:52	<ucordes>	recovery and then?
11:52	<penguinwhoflew>	glxblt: do "sudo mount /dev/hdXX /home/ubuntu/Desktop/<folder you've made>"
11:52	<iNiku>	SurfnKid: sorry, what will? grub booting off an lvm/raid root?
11:52	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, not changing to anything at this point, Ive been on ubuntu for nearly a week and Im not about to do a typical 'reinstall' it took me very long to configure certain things and Im just learning so I'lll read that darn manual :P
11:52	<Ng>	ucordes: run "passwd yourusername"
11:52	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, reading the online manual
11:52	<nbx909>	jesus this support option is crazy
11:52	<penguinwhoflew>	SurfnKid: i've got access to the installed upon drives MBR, now how do i fix it...?
11:53	<glxblt>	penguinwhoflew: yeah, that's one solution.. but i'd like to fix the links at the computer browser
11:53	<Nrbelex>	If my computer meets the min. specs but can't make it through the graphical install through the live CD, how do I go through the old style install?
11:53	<nbx909>	they need support ticket like system
11:53	<nbx909>	lol
11:53	<crazy_penguin>	h3sp4wn: around?
11:53	<pandamonium>	Jinkguns, i've found it's probably better to ask the question rather than announcing that you have one
11:53	<xanavim>	Nrbelex: try the alternate install cd from the downloads section of ubuntu pages
11:53	<eobanb>	nbx909, support tickets are organised, but not very fast.
11:53	<iNiku>	SurfnKid: hehe... well I've been running dapper on my laptop for a while now but I want to migrate my debian desktop to dapper too
11:53	<SurfnKid>	penguinwhoflew,  mmm not saavy in that part sorry :(
11:53	<ucordes>	Ng: does this create a new account?
11:53	<Nrbelex>	xanavim, just the one alternate, not the server CD?
11:53	<scifi>	wooohoooooo, xorg backup works!!! altho i need to do the refresh rate fix again :D
11:53	<Ng>	ucordes: no, it just changes the password for yourusername (ie whatever username you put in)
11:53	<flossgeek>	eobanb, should i try advance instead of medium
11:53	<iNiku>	SurfnKid: but the thing is, I've got an LVM installation there and I want to preserve the /home filesystem
11:54	<exhale>	how do i get the address bar in Nautilus PERMANENT?
11:54	<eobanb>	nbx909, it's only truly crazy on rare days like this when there are 1000+ users in the channel.
11:54	<[zero] >	Whats the thing called (on the panel) that shows amsn and that envolope? and that kind of stuff..?
11:54	<titanium_platypu>	dang, it's taking me forever to download Dapper
11:54	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, awesome, how has it been running? my laptop works awesome on it
11:54	<titanium_platypu>	heavy traffic?
11:54	<eobanb>	flossgeek, yes, that's what i already said
11:54	<nbx909>	eobanb, true but there is an ircd that has a bot that will only voice a few people at a time so that it doesn't get crazy
11:54	<Jinkguns>	Panda, sorry.
11:54	<xanavim>	Nrbelex: I don't know about the server cd, just the desktop and alternate ones
11:54	<delire>	livevil: you should just be able to double-click it anyway..
11:54	<dabaR>	exhale: gconf
11:54	<visik7>	dapper rulez really !!!
11:54	<visik7>	I've put the livecd on an new asus V6J
11:54	<visik7>	and all JUST works
11:54	<kbrooks>	i want ubuntu cds now!
11:54	<eobanb>	nbx909, then users wouldn't be able to ask/answer questions when they needed to.
11:54	<visik7>	great!
11:54	<ucordes>	k ill try that ng
11:54	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, oh asi in booting to debian an ubuntu?
11:54	<penguinwhoflew>	anyone know how to fix a MBR so i don't get crazy operating system errors in BIOS?
11:54	<ucordes>	thx
11:54	<kbrooks>	i want ubuntu cds now!
11:54	<Nrbelex>	xanavim, that's fine - thanks
11:54	<Jinkguns>	Can anyone tell me why network manager can't even handle logging onto a wireless network?
11:54	<exhale>	dabaR, command not found
11:54	<eobanb>	kbrooks, so download them
11:54	<scifi>	eobanb: the xorg.backup worked, just need to do the refresh rate fix again :D
11:54	<nbx909>	eobanb, once one person's problem is "solved" they are devoiced
11:54	<kbrooks>	Canonical, SHIP THEM TO ME NOW!
11:54	<heanol>	snoops, Did you solve the booting issues?
11:55	<eobanb>	kbrooks, unless you have a question, please stop
11:55	<SurfnKid>	Jinkguns, make sure there is no encryption
11:55	<crimsun>	Jinkguns: because n-m is ... young.
11:55	<pandamonium>	Jinkguns, no need to apologise to me ;-) i'm just some clueless nitwit who's trying to learn something ;-)
11:55	<scifi>	eobanb:  thx for the reminders
11:55	<petiteconne>	hey is somebody here who can tell me how i can start the bash before gnome/x
11:55	<Xyloc>	Howto reconfigure Xorg?
11:55	<yipe>	YAY! 1000+ people!
11:55	<nbx909>	eobanb, they message chanserv with a flag to be put in line
11:55	<kbrooks>	HymnToLife: why?
11:55	<xanavim>	Jinkguns: I got the impression it worked best with eth0
11:55	<HymnToLife>	because I want them too :p
11:55	<dabaR>	exhale: the gconf editor has that as an option. You will need to search for a while, since you are not even familiar with the program
11:55	<nbx909>	Xylene, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
11:55	<iNiku>	SurfnKid: no, I want to upgrade the desktop to dapper by doing a clean install but I want to preserve /home, which is on lvm+raid
11:55	<nbx909>	!reconfigurex
11:55	<crimsun>	petiteconne: please clarify your question
11:55	<ubotu>	What? Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, nbx909
11:56	<davmor2>	please tell me someone here is on 64bit and has installed bonfire, please
11:56	<wastrel>	is there a diary or journal entry type in evolution?
=== Antiliis is now known as RicardoPerez
11:56	<nbx909>	ubotu, reconfigurex is sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
11:56	<ubotu>	nbx909: okay
11:56	<livevil>	delire: it answer:" an error has occured processing FrostWire-4.10.9-1-i586.deb access denied (translated from italian)
11:56	<[zero] >	Whats the thing called (on the panel) that shows amsn and that envolope? and that kind of stuff..?
11:56	<nbx909>	!reconfigurex
11:56	<ubotu>	reconfigurex is, like, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
=== gnomefreak is now known as xfcefreak
11:56	<nbx909>	:)
11:56	<Ng>	[zero] : the systray maybe?
11:56	<eobanb>	livevil, you need to use sudo
11:56	<kbrooks>	nbx909: dont test in channel
11:56	<[zero] >	ng yeh thankx
11:56	<kbrooks>	nbx909: dont test in /msg
11:56	<pappan>	why ndiswrapper-utils is asking for breezy badger cd while installation ??
11:56	<exhale>	dabaR, what command to run the program?
11:56	<penguinwhoflew>	ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo grub-install /dev/hdb   Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.
11:56	<Xyloc>	Nice bot Ubotu! thx
11:56	<petiteconne>	crimsun: on booting my xserver starts and if i want to change view into tty1 for example its not ready ... it dures about 15 seconds longer
11:56	<Tom__>	is there a central configuration tool in dapper drake server? or should I do all configuration (network etc. by hand)?
11:56	<nbx909>	kbrooks, okay sorry
11:56	<dabaR>	exhale: gconf-editor
11:57	<exhale>	pappan, because you have the cd in sources.list
11:57	<xfcefreak>	nbx909: i think he meant test in /msg not channel
11:57	<Jinkguns>	OMG
11:57	<kbrooks>	nbx909: /msg ubotu <fill in>
11:57	<Jinkguns>	Network manager worked
11:57	<livevil>	I write sudo
11:57	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, ohh i see, that might be possible i assume doin some tweakin
11:57	<Jinkguns>	all on its own
11:57	<Jinkguns>	I'm so proud. :D
11:57	<kbrooks>	xfcefreak: ty
11:57	<xfcefreak>	yw
11:57	<nbx909>	kbrooks, yeah i'm not an irc n00b i know what you ment
11:57	<livevil>	I write the complete command
11:57	<HymnToLife>	!reconfigurex
11:57	<ubotu>	To reconfigure your X server, run the command         sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
11:57	<K|NgGh0sT>	How do I get ubuntu from showing "Display CHanged: LCD On" randomly all the time?
11:57	<keleus>	whats a good utility for taking MP3s and making audio CDs? (I can't use SCSI burners, i have ATAPI)
11:57	<crimsun>	petiteconne: yes, that delay is due to our init sequence
11:57	<anthony>	okay, i have installed totem-xine (all of its dependencies) and totem-xine-firefox-plugin, and the w32codecs, but i still cannot play embedded medias
11:57	<livevil>	sudo dpkg -i /home/FrostWire-4.10.9-1-i586.deb
11:57	<dizy>	hi guys... i was thinking of installing ubuntu as a server... i was wondering if someone can point me to some reading material on firewall settings port forwarding etc
11:58	<pandamonium>	if i add the debian ftp package servers into my sources.list will i be able to use those?
11:58	<crimsun>	petiteconne: it's intentional
11:58	<pandamonium>	and if so is there a major caveat?
11:58	<xanavim>	anthony: try libxine-extracodecs
11:58	<eobanb>	pandamonium, don't do that.
11:58	<crimsun>	pandamonium: it's very likely you'll hose your system.
11:58	<laxdragon>	my upgrade died on lvm2 dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/lvm2_2.02.02-1ubuntu1_i386.deb (--unpack): subprocess pre-installation script returned error exit status 10
11:58	<nbx909>	paddygman, yes but it will break your system
11:58	<kbrooks>	xfcefreak: are you a gnome freak or a xfce freak?
11:58	<eobanb>	pandamonium, it can sometimes work, but it's risky
11:58	<dabaR>	dizy: it depends on what you will be using as the firewall
11:58	<xfcefreak>	kbrooks: a lil of both ;0
11:58	<pappan>	exhale, ty i deselected i will try again
11:58	<nbx909>	laxdragon, reinstall
11:58	<SurfnKid>	Jinkguns, Congratulations,  Feels good to be able to do this on your own doesnt it :D
11:58	<exhale>	pappan, np
11:58	<pandamonium>	eobanb, it will cause conflicts?
11:58	<crimsun>	laxdragon: did you read the release notes reading lvm?
11:58	<kbrooks>	xfcefreak: so why not gxfreak?
11:59	<dabaR>	dizy: man iptables is a fair place to start. That is the default firewall program.
11:59	<petiteconne>	crimsun: but if i want to change it? is there no way? :)
11:59	<eobanb>	pandamonium, ubuntu's own repository is pretty huge.  it basically has everything debian's has.  so just stick with ubuntu's okay?
11:59	<laxdragon>	crimsun: no, got a link to it?
11:59	<xfcefreak>	right now im customizing xfce ;)
11:59	<JonnyBoy>	eobanb: i went through the configuration of xserver-xorg, but that didn't help
11:59	<heanol>	how do i use lilo with dapper?
11:59	<delire>	livevil: is synaptic open elsewhere? did you use sudo?
11:59	<crimsun>	petiteconne: sure, you can bump (increment) the gdm startup
11:59	<pandamonium>	eobanb, ok... just i'm having massive problems getting stuff from there
11:59	<Oddie>	exit
11:59	<eobanb>	heanol, i'd stick with grub.
11:59	<anthony>	xanavim: i can download them to my hard drive and play them fine, but when it's embedded in the browser, it doesn't work
11:59	<crimsun>	laxdragon: wiki/DapperReleaseNotes
11:59	<K|NgGh0sT>	How do I get ubuntu from showing "Display Changed: LCD On" randomly?
11:59	<dabaR>	gnomefreak, xfcefreak...
11:59	<JonnyBoy>	eobanb: rebooted, and went into normal mode - Said that the xserver failed to load
11:59	<crimsun>	laxdragon: see also the release announcement
11:59	<xanavim>	anthony: dunno

[none]	[12:02]	<pitti_>	kermitX_, usually, the installer manually installs all *-desktop dependencies to prevent that; if xubuntu doesn't do that, then you should indeed file a bug

[none]	[12:21]	<Polypterus>	GMT 00:00 is what I've heard
[none]	[12:21]	<keherman>	would people pay like $10 for up to 15 minutes of Uubuntu support?
[none]	[12:21]	<sybariten>	"i just cant understand why people want to know if its released in 14 or 18 hours? Do they have clients that are terrible dependent on this specific release or ""what-the-fuss?"""
[none]	[12:21]	<odjay>	keherman - well basically when I boot my livecd I use the persistent flag and the boot faile with an error at /dev/sde drive or something
[none]	[12:21]	<Spec>	damn, maybe i was hit by a windmill
[none]	[12:21]	<nbx909>	Seveas, will it be a sane hour? edt

[none]	[12:21]	<Doso>	sybariten: Well basicly I got nothing else to do and i want to use daper drake to do my final Windows -> Linux switch ~~
[none]	[12:21]	<odjay>	keherman - otherwise without peristent flag (to save session on usb pen) my dapper work very well

[none]	[12:23]	<eric>	OK OK
[none]	[12:23]	<ucordes>	gnomefreak, so it's no big difference to the last image?

[none]	[12:25]	<sybariten>	keherman: hmm
[none]	[12:25]	<keherman>	sybariten, meant to make the platforms similar in defined ways so that software can be compatible across multiple distrivutions
[none]	[12:25]	<Seveas>	"nbx909, yes 90 minutes more of ""is it going to be at 0:00"" crap"

[none]	[12:27]	<Seveas>	s|k, wtf
[none]	[12:27]	<livevil>	DO you need something more for internet security over firestarter
[none]	[12:27]	<kspath_>	"s|k: ""they"" a conspiracy?"
[none]	[12:27]	<gnomefreak>	ucordes: crap is what it is IMHO
[none]	[12:27]	<Seveas>	forums really are ruled by crappy idiots I guess
[none]	[12:27]	<livevil>	do you think I need something else for internet security, over firestarter?
[none]	[12:27]	<sybariten>	"keherman: ok ... i have appearently changed mine since installing ubuntu, and now when upgrading versions, there is a ""newer"" version or something and apt asks me if i want to upgrade the file or not"
[none]	[12:27]	<czambran>	Seveas, why do you say that?
[none]	[12:27]	<kspath_>	livevil: clue is good for security,
[none]	[12:27]	<gnomefreak>	if you write code to have a number/name and not do it for yourself or to help others its not worth a crap
[none]	[12:27]	<Seveas>	czambran, deleting posts is SO not done
[none]	[12:28]	<[zero] >	Anyone know why when I boot up ubuntu it just restarts?
[none]	[12:28]	<czambran>	Seveas, ohh that, my bad
[none]	[12:28]	<ucordes>	nikomedia was captured by sultan orhan in 1st in 1337

[none]	[12:28]	<BSDinux>	how can i temporarily deactivate gnome? i want to start X11 without gnome, but i can't find the /etc/rc.conf on my ubuntu box...
[none]	[12:28]	<gnomefreak>	odjay: june 1st
[positive]	[12:28]	<yct>	kspath_, I know there's hours to release, but this is the place to be at:)
[none]	[12:28]	<ucordes>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC!
[none]	[12:28]	<kspath_>	livevil: I think there will be some information on securing ubuntu at ubuntu sites. General linux security howtos are everywhere.
[none]	[12:28]	<ucordes>	lol
[positive]	[12:28]	<RandolphCarter>	gah, 0.00 BST? :D
[none]	[12:28]	<hollywoodb>	odjay: if you stay current with apt-get or synaptic you'll basically be running the same thing as dapper stable
[none]	[12:29]	<Mysta_>	i think i've tried to run apt-get / aptitude too many times. now it says theres a lock. how do i remove this LOCK???
[none]	[12:29]	<Seveas>	Mysta_, the safest way is to reboot
[none]	[12:29]	<Sharjeel>	1111-0000-1100    0001-0011-0011-0111
[none]	[12:29]	<yct>	kspath_, I could install RC and update, but this is the event; i'm happy
[positive]	[12:29]	<Sharjeel>	:)
[none]	[12:29]	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: i didnt they there was a number of times
[none]	[12:29]	<Seveas>	Sharjeel, stop it
[none]	[12:29]	<kspath_>	livevil: firestarter is only a firewall and only the tip of basic security. a firewall can not prevent problems by itself.
[none]	[12:29]	<Sharjeel>	soz
[none]	[12:29]	<czambran>	I didn't even know, you could get lock out
[none]	[12:29]	<aleksand1r>	anyone knows the difference between 'sudo update-manager -d' from the console and 'gksudo update-manager -d'? the latter doesn't show the option to upgrade to dapper - strange
[none]	[12:29]	<livevil>	ok, sorry for the stupid question
[none]	[12:29]	<darich>	the Dapper update broke my networking...and borked my fglrx driver
[none]	[12:29]	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: im not sure i understand your last comment
[positive]	[12:29]	<Sharjeel>	dint mean to be rude seveas but i doent likel337 lingo:D
[none]	[12:29]	<darich>	but I fixed it
[none]	[12:29]	<Seveas>	"aleksand1r, gksudo ""update-manager -d"
[none]	[12:30]	<darich>	so it's all good

[none]	[12:30]	<erus`>	please help
[none]	[12:30]	<kspath_>	livevil: Not really a stupid question. It is something you can answer for yourself by doing research.
[none]	[12:30]	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: i didnt know there was a lock when you used apt-get or aptitude too many times
[none]	[12:30]	<ucordes>	darich: i also broke my system with the update
[none]	[12:30]	<_clem>	hey !! Dapper was released. There's a leak on one of the Czech mirrors !!
[none]	[12:30]	<aleksand1r>	thanks @seveas
[none]	[12:30]	<Rdde>	keherman, have you ever used the program ? kismet?
[none]	[12:30]	<Sharjeel>	hey does ubuntu come with the nvidia driver or will i have to install it?
[none]	[12:30]	<Mysta_>	gnomefreak: sorry, i assumed that.

[none]	[12:30]	<hollywoodb>	Mysta_: gnomefreak: there's a lock when either synaptic, aptitude, or apt-get processes are currently running
[none]	[12:30]	<erus`>	followed that but still no worky

[none]	[12:31]	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: apt
[none]	[12:31]	<Mysta_>	thx
[none]	[12:31]	<Rdde>	keherman, what dose that mean? =P
[none]	[12:31]	<aleksand1r>	checked it - works with brackets
[none]	[12:31]	<gnomefreak>	Mysta_: if synaptic is open apt wont run because it uses apt
[positive]	[12:31]	<keherman>	Rdde, it means I've used it for a very long time :-)
[none]	[12:31]	<keherman>	Rdde, H2K2 is a 'hacker' conference
[none]	[12:31]	<darich>	really ucordes
[none]	[12:31]	<hollywoodb>	gnomefreak: I'm aware, but if it could be a hanging process from one of the many times it was run, causing the lock to remain in place
[none]	[12:31]	<your_mom>	whats the apt-get to install xorg again
[none]	[12:31]	<gnomefreak>	hollywoodb: true

[none]	[12:32]	<keherman>	aleksand1r, yep
[none]	[12:32]	<keherman>	aleksand1r, many files will be overwritten
[positive]	[12:32]	<_clem>	it happened for FC5 though, and as I remember there were leaks on SUSE10.1 as well. People became to go crazy just before the release. Fedora had given a precise time 2pm GMT it was crazy on some forums :)

[positive]	[12:34]	<aleksand1r>	26 min. to dapper release ;)
[none]	[12:34]	<hollywoodb>	Filbert: Xfce instead of KDE or Gnome
[none]	[12:34]	<weierstrass>	hi there. i have a problem. when i installed ubuntu i forgot to make a swap partition. the system boots and everything, but what's the easiest way to repartition and fix this?
[positive]	[12:34]	<yct>	_clem, I've seen benchmarks and stuff, but in my own experience i can't stand anything else than reiser.. didn't tried xfs though
[none]	[12:34]	<MTecknology>	Installed Dapper and restored my firefox profile. I restored it from a Windows profile and it actually worked. Only problem is that when I try to play a flash game, it gets stuck in a loop and eventually closes ff, when I try to use a java applet, it just closes ff while loading. - i doubt this is dapper specific
[none]	[12:34]	<Seveas>	aleksand1r, last warning.
[none]	[12:34]	<SurfnKid>	does anyone knowh ow to create a FN KEY for a specific command

[positive]	[12:35]	<_clem>	yct: I like reiserfs myself, even though I don't really know why :) I used to be a slackware fan, and Patrick loved Reiserfs... I guess I got that from him.. I don't know much about FS though.
[none]	[12:35]	<Mysta_>	lol ok

[none]	[01:27]	<Newbify2>	ompaul, ok yea I was just wondering, because it seems like this will be a very popular release and a bittorrent would be nice to save bandwidth from the mirrors
[positive]	[01:27]	<dmbt>	so, its going to be released in a couple minutes ;)
[none]	[01:27]	<Stormx2>	maybe
[positive]	[01:27]	<mcmahons>	Newwbify2: haha who cares shuttleworth's paying for it :)
[none]	[01:27]	<Seveas>	Versed, keep this a secret, but I heard from some of the lead developers that morning or midday isn't unlikely
[none]	[01:27]	<ompaul>	Newbify2, well no doubt some people will have it on torrent as soon as they upload for it
[none]	[01:28]	<Stormx2>	How come our cosmonaut overlord is so rich?

[none]	[01:28]	<ompaul>	mcmahons, we all should, better to get it to an extra 5 people who can't afford it on CDs than waste it on bandwidth tarriffs

[positive]	[02:14]	<_clem>	see you tomorrow. Patience is a vertue (or something like that..). :)
[none]	[02:14]	<krazykit>	Ademan: no, you don't.  the uninstall stuff sticks around.  you just need to remove it with your favorite method, be that synaptic or dpkg
[none]	[02:15]	<crimsun>	rixxon: the dapper one is 'unrar', also in multiverse
[positive]	[02:15]	<rixxon>	crimsun: does it mean it is not free? :P
[none]	[02:15]	<tested2>	Flannel, yeah but I only want it to highlight then

[none]	[02:49]	<medgno>	hou5ton, okay, then I'm not sure. You did everything right as far as I know.

[none]	[02:51]	<bruce89>	but then when people say stuff about dapper you tell them to keep on topic, but the topic is dapper
[none]	[02:51]	<Flannel>	bruce89: only by resignation.
[none]	[02:51]	<JohnP789>	"""time sudo hdparm /dev/hdc"" takes over a minute to complete.  I don't see anything in the logs to suggest what's wrong.  Any ideas?"
[none]	[02:51]	<FliesLikeABrick>	"bruce89 when people ask ""when will dapper be out?!?"" we point them to the topic rather than telling them over and over"
[none]	[02:52]	<JohnP789>	/dev/hdc is an NEC DVD burner.
[none]	[02:52]	<bruce89>	i see
[none]	[02:52]	<matallo>	there's no rss for teh fridge?
[none]	[02:52]	<bruce89>	it is very annoying i supose
[none]	[02:52]	<bruce89>	yes there is
[none]	[02:52]	<matallo>	oh ye
[none]	[02:52]	<matallo>	sorry
[none]	[02:52]	<JohnP789>	It's instantaneous with no media in the drive.
[none]	[02:53]	<FliesLikeABrick>	JohnP789 then it is likely reading data from the drive
[none]	[02:53]	<xumbi>	anyone know what server(s) will have dapper first?
[none]	[02:53]	<gnomefreak>	xumbi: no but you will be informed
[none]	[02:54]	<nosklo>	xumbi, people are suggesting microsoft.com
[positive]	[02:54]	<gnomefreak>	if im still up ;)
[none]	[02:54]	<jrasith>	lol, microsoft.com
[none]	[02:54]	<AngryElf>	how can i get the version of a package installed using apt-get?
[none]	[02:54]	<tommy>	i d like to know if there will be a version that fits on a cd, or is it gonna be available only on dvd ?
[none]	[02:54]	<medgno>	there will be cd images
[none]	[02:54]	<fortgate>	AngryElf, apt-cache policy <packagename>
[none]	[02:54]	<troy_s>	angry:  have you tried apt-cache?
[none]	[02:54]	<grimboy>	man
[none]	[02:54]	<AngryElf>	or ,whatever program......just not synaptic
[none]	[02:54]	<Flannel>	AngryElf: apt-cache show [package]  or showpkg
[none]	[02:54]	<gnomefreak>	AngryElf: what package?
[none]	[02:54]	<FliesLikeABrick>	xumbi your best bet (if you're looking for a CD image) is to get it from the torrents
[none]	[02:54]	<ggilbert>	tommy, it will fit on a cd
[positive]	[02:54]	<xumbi>	nolsko: awesome, I'll watch that ;)
[none]	[02:55]	<ablyss>	i need to report a bug.. tail -c in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Dapper doesn't work
[none]	[02:55]	<tommy>	ggilbert, thanks
[none]	[02:55]	<Ophiocus>	AngryElf: in synaptic search in your installed tab for a description
[none]	[02:55]	<bruce89>	tired, bye
[none]	[02:55]	<FliesLikeABrick>	ablyss  if you need help with dapper between now and tomorrow, go to #ubuntu+1
[none]	[02:55]	<gnomefreak>	ubotu tell ablyss about bug
[none]	[02:55]	<hou5ton>	I've downloaded the Dapper RC and burned the ISO, twice ... but it won't install
[none]	[02:55]	<Hitchhiker>	How well does Ubuntu upgrade between versions?  With SuSE, it's been hit or miss, and mostly miss...
[none]	[02:55]	<ablyss>	thanks
[none]	[02:55]	<FliesLikeABrick>	Hitchhiker flawlessly
[none]	[02:55]	<gnomefreak>	!upgrade
[negative]	[02:55]	<ubotu>	"upgrade is probably Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo ""update-manager -d"" always updates to the bleeding edge."
[none]	[02:55]	<FliesLikeABrick>	Hitchhiker it is somethign tested very carefully
[none]	[02:55]	<ggilbert>	Hitchhiker: It does a dandy job upgrading
[none]	[02:55]	<FliesLikeABrick>	something*
[positive]	[02:55]	<xumbi>	anyone know what the title will be?  e.g. ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso  I'm trying to write a script to download it as soon as it's released :)
[none]	[02:55]	<AngryElf>	i could imagine that more than one version gets cached, with that in mind, apt-cache will show the version of the package that's installed, yes?
[none]	[02:56]	<FliesLikeABrick>	hou5ton you may want to wait and re-download the actual stable release tomorrow
[none]	[02:56]	<Hitchhiker>	Sweet
[none]	[02:56]	<BadriNarayan>	Can I ask a question about NetworkManager in ubuntu here?
[positive]	[02:56]	<Flannel>	Hitchhiker: it upgrades fine, there are some leftover packages you sometimes have to remove afterwards, but they're not anything that's going to explode.
[none]	[02:56]	<gnomefreak>	xumbi: 5.10 was released in oct 2005
[none]	[02:56]	<FliesLikeABrick>	gnomefreak he was using that as an example
[none]	[02:56]	<FliesLikeABrick>	xumbi just check it by hand, scripts will just load the servers un-necessarily
[none]	[02:56]	<hou5ton>	FliesLikeABrick::  ya .. at this point ... good idea
[none]	[02:56]	<xumbi>	gnomefreak: yes I know, I was just using that as an example
[none]	[02:56]	<thenetduck>	hey i thought they said 0:00 GMT for Dapper release is that correct?
[none]	[02:56]	<FliesLikeABrick>	thenetduck read the topic /topic
[none]	[02:56]	<fortgate>	AngryElf, apt-cache policy <pkg>       will show you the currently installed version, and the available versions
[none]	[02:56]	<Kyral>	look at the topic...
[none]	[02:56]	<Bilford>	it's 00:56
[none]	[02:56]	<xumbi>	FliesLikeABrick: good point
[none]	[02:56]	<guano>	xumbi i think it would look something like dapper-dvd-i386.iso
[none]	[02:56]	<Hitchhiker>	Flannel: Sweet... SuSE has often caused things like network to stop working at boot when doing upgrades...
[none]	[02:57]	<gnomefreak>	xumbi: ubuntu-6.06-alternative-1386.iso  afaik
[none]	[02:57]	<AngryElf>	fortgate, thanx
[none]	[02:57]	<FliesLikeABrick>	I highly reccomend downloading the images via torrent rather than loading the webservers once dapper is released
[none]	[02:57]	<FliesLikeABrick>	it will be much faster
[none]	[02:57]	<gnomefreak>	thenetduck: no it was not correct
[positive]	[02:57]	<fortgate>	OMG irc channels come with topics now?  :)
[none]	[02:57]	<thenetduck>	gosh darn it

[none]	[03:03]	<Bilford>	lufis, to play mp3 in Breezy, you need gstream, for Dapper you need libxine
[none]	[03:03]	<Sgeo>	Is there a reason for withholding the release time?
[none]	[03:03]	<BadriNarayan>	Does anybody use network-manager? Does it work all the time?

[none]	[03:03]	<gnomefreak>	Sgeo: ther eis no time

[none]	[03:04]	<Efnian_>	moonman, yes
[none]	[03:04]	<ggilbert>	exhale: Xchat-gnome has a bit of a nicer ui, but it doesn't have every feature of xchat

[none]	[03:23]	<ryno>	I have a usb device that works fine when it's coldplugged but when I turn it off and then turn it back on the module doesn't come up anymore. Any idea how I can figure out why and how to fix it?
[none]	[03:23]	<baseman_>	ugh why is this
[none]	[03:23]	<FliesLikeABrick>	gnomefreak is dapper technically considered beta right now or something more since it is past RC?
[negative]	[03:23]	<chapium>	dapper was a horrible upgrade for me, it enticed me to mess with things i shouldn't.  Like xgl.  Now my gdm is screwed :(
[none]	[03:23]	<grimboy>	rixxon: Use gxine then
[none]	[03:23]	<gnomefreak>	rixxon: if you install totem-xine than the totem you see is it

[none]	[03:38]	<rixxon>	!tell T-CAN about restricted
[none]	[03:38]	<T-CAN>	i havent found any packages in synaptec
[none]	[03:38]	<DShepherd>	rixxon: what was the solution?
[none]	[03:38]	<jrsims>	hey, looks like I deleted my home directory and all my settings files for gnome.
[none]	[03:38]	<jmworx>	FliesLikeABrick: Oops, thanks
[none]	[03:38]	<poimen>	suspekt : dist-upgrade is when u are using another number of relese like if yopuwere using breezy (5.10 ) and want to go to dapper (6.06)
[none]	[03:38]	<jrsims>	How do I create a new gnome profile
[none]	[03:38]	<jrsims>	?

[none]	[03:39]	<T-CAN>	ya, i have universe and multiverse enabled
[none]	[03:39]	<T-CAN>	i just need to know which packages to get
[none]	[03:39]	<T-CAN>	if there are any
[none]	[03:39]	<jrsims>	Can anyone tell me how to create a new Gnome profile after I accidentally killed my home directory?
[none]	[03:39]	<pianoboy3333>	What command will give me all the packages that I can update, but just a list, not apt-get update
[none]	[03:40]	<Warbo>	"T-CAN: Just get anything beginning with ""gstreamer"" and you should be OK"
[negative]	[03:40]	<rixxon>	T-CAN: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats#head-16ea04e7e1ecd06555912ba3f470b56563cbd85d
[none]	[03:40]	<todayisagift>	can you think of anything else other than VNC?
[none]	[03:40]	<bkh>	VNC is the standard way of getting remote desktops
[none]	[03:40]	<grimboy>	T-CAN: sudo apt-get install gstreamer*
[none]	[03:41]	<bkh>	Both in the windows world and linux
[none]	[03:41]	<Healot>	OS independent i would say
[none]	[03:41]	<todayisagift>	ok then ubuntu is what version of linux (x...)
[none]	[03:41]	<jrsims>	Hello!! Can anyone tell me how to create a new Gnome profile after I accidentally killed my home directory?
[none]	[03:41]	<mcmahons>	pianoboy3333: there'll be a switch for apt-get update, do a man apt
[none]	[03:41]	<DShepherd>	T-CAN: use synpatic and install gstreamer0.10 stuff
[none]	[03:41]	<Warbo>	pianoboy3333: Dunno. If you use the clean option then --download-only you would know that everything in /var/cache/apt/archives was upgradable
[none]	[03:42]	<Warbo>	jrsims: Usually just logging in again will do it (after copying anything from /etc/skel to your new home)
[none]	[03:42]	<_tmx_dt2>	hey can any1 help me mount my ntfs primary hard drive that i can't find ever since I BSOD safe mode or not.  thanks
[none]	[03:42]	<delire>	888 nicks. nize
[none]	[03:42]	<matthew>	hi
[none]	[03:43]	<Tweek888>	Has anyone not been able to get nvidia drivers working properly on dapper?
[none]	[03:43]	<jrsims>	Warbo: well, I will enter gnome from the login screen, but then all I get is a screen with my mouse pointer on it
[none]	[03:43]	<matthew>	how do i install apps and programs on gnome?
[none]	[03:43]	<todayisagift>	what version of linux is ubuntu?
[none]	[03:43]	<jrsims>	Warbo: no menu bars or anything
[none]	[03:43]	<Harold_P>	there is no version of linux..
[none]	[03:43]	<Harold_P>	just kernel version, really
[none]	[03:43]	<jrsims>	Warbo: so I was thinking I probably killed all my gnome settings in the home directory.
[positive]	[03:43]	<NoUse>	Harold_P linux is the kernel :-)
[none]	[03:44]	<grimboy>	And versions of gnu tools
[none]	[03:44]	<DShepherd>	matthew: synaptic
[none]	[03:44]	<jpatota>	todayisagift, ubuntu is a verion of linux
[none]	[03:44]	<grimboy>	Linux is nothing without gnu tools
[none]	[03:44]	<Warbo>	jrsims: Did you lose your actual home directory?
[none]	[03:44]	<bkh>	There should be something like /etc/skel/ with a base gnome home dir stuff in it
[none]	[03:44]	<mcmahons>	todayisagift: it uses linux version 2.6 (that is linux kernel 2.6)
[none]	[03:44]	<matthew>	what is synaptic?
[none]	[03:44]	<jpatota>	that too
[none]	[03:44]	<earthen_>	"matthew,  simantic or comand line atp-get install ""name of package"""
[none]	[03:44]	<suspekt>	i was about to say i always condisdured 'linux' in the way a person would talk about it is made of up of lots of diffrent core programs
[none]	[03:44]	<_tmx_dt2>	hey can any1 help me mount my ntfs primary hard drive that i can't find ever since I BSOD safe mode or not.  thanks
[none]	[03:44]	<NoUse>	todayisagift Linux is the the piece that talks to the hardware, if you want to know what version of Linux you are running run 'uname -a'
[none]	[03:44]	<jrsims>	Warbo: well, no. but everything in it is gone.
[none]	[03:44]	<Tweek888>	Can some one help me with configuring my nvidia drivers?
[none]	[03:44]	<shane_>	matthew - front end to apt
[none]	[03:44]	<Tweek888>	they're just not working..
[none]	[03:44]	<Warbo>	bkh: I think /etc/skel just has base stuff to log in, and once in GNOME makes it's own configs if they are not there
[none]	[03:44]	<NoUse>	todayisagift if you want to know what version of ubuntu you are running run 'lsb_release -a'
[none]	[03:45]	<Warbo>	jrsims: including hidden stuff?
[none]	[03:45]	<earthen_>	matthew, it the gui program for install software, it will download what you want and install it for you
[none]	[03:45]	<shane_>	nouse - good info
[negative]	[03:45]	<grimboy>	_tmx_dt2: http://ubuntuguide.org/#mountunmountntfs
[none]	[03:45]	<jrsims>	"Warbo: yeah. I just did an ""ls -a"" though, and it looks like I have some of my settings files back. Still, gnome won't fully load."
[none]	[03:45]	<bkh>	warbo: That's what I thought, but the guy said that didn't work...
[none]	[03:45]	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, does it show up in your bios or /etc/fstab?
[none]	[03:46]	<theCore>	how do I lock a package version in command line?
[none]	[03:46]	<matthew>	i cant find gui
[none]	[03:46]	<earthen_>	matthew, it in System-->Administration -->Synaptic package manager
[none]	[03:46]	<_tmx_dt2>	it shows up in bios lemme check etc/fstab
[none]	[03:46]	<todayisagift>	NoUse: the reason i ask is when i go to d/l VNC it asks linux (x86, x64, ia64) and i just dont know
[none]	[03:47]	<void^>	theCore: apt-cache policy
[positive]	[03:47]	<_tmx_dt2>	i don't have a fstab folder :-x
[none]	[03:47]	<delire>	todayisagift: ia64 is Itanium. x64 is AMD64, x86 is generic intel
[none]	[03:47]	<cowbud>	w00t w00t dapper
[none]	[03:47]	<grimboy>	_tmx_dt2: It's not a folder
[positive]	[03:47]	<delire>	cowbud: countdown to rockinpops
[none]	[03:47]	<matthew>	earthen ok i found it i download an app from a site now how do i install
[none]	[03:47]	<Warbo>	jrsims: Hmmm. Are you really concerned with your settings (ie. customised to the extreme like me) because maybe deleting them and letting them be remade might work. However, it may not be a settings problem, it may be a  network/authentication one
[positive]	[03:47]	<cowbud>	delire: is there actually a countdown? :)
[none]	[03:47]	<earthen_>	matthew, GUI stands for Graphical User Interface
[positive]	[03:47]	<delire>	cowbud: there should be!
[none]	[03:47]	<_tmx_dt2>	what is it?
[none]	[03:47]	<jdub>	todayisagift: you're looking for a vnc client?
[positive]	[03:47]	<cowbud>	indeed there should be :)
[none]	[03:47]	<theCore>	void^: how do I lock one?
[none]	[03:47]	<earthen_>	matthew, if you can see your desktop you have gui
[none]	[03:47]	<kspath>	 /topic
[none]	[03:48]	<delire>	theCore: what do you mean by 'lock'?
[positive]	[03:48]	<cowbud>	I got loads of systems waiting to get the official I know a snapshot would probably work but meh :)
[none]	[03:48]	<grimboy>	_tmx_dt2: sudo gedit /etc/fstab from the terminal
[positive]	[03:48]	<_tmx_dt2>	lol even i knew that ;)
[none]	[03:48]	<jrsims>	Warbo: well, I'm not too worried about my settings, and it does look like many of the settings files were recreated when I attempted to log in again.
[negative]	[03:48]	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2:, http://www.linuxforum.com/linux_tutorials/1/1.php
[none]	[03:48]	<todayisagift>	jdub: yea do you have any suggestions, i need to vnc, (with full control) from my unix machine to a windows machine
[positive]	[03:48]	<delire>	cowbud: my bt client is chomping at the bit.. foaming even.
[none]	[03:48]	<earthen_>	matthew, if you downloaded it with the Synaptic package manager then it is allready installed
[none]	[03:48]	<Warbo>	jrsims: I have encountered this before, but I forgot how I solved it. I think it was a permission thing
[none]	[03:48]	<jrsims>	Warbo: so maybe it's not the fact that I killed my files, it's something else. I'm not sure what to do. Would an apt-get of gnome be an idea?
[none]	[03:48]	<jdub>	todayisagift: there's one installed by default, the frontend for it is called 'terminal server client' (under internet in your menu)
[none]	[03:48]	<_tmx_dt2>	how do you access the root in ubuntu?
[none]	[03:48]	<Flannel>	!tell _tmx_dt2 about root
[none]	[03:48]	<theCore>	delire: I have custom packages, and I don't want APT overwrite them
[none]	[03:48]	<grimboy>	delire: Speaking of that, how come all of ubuntu's bittorrent clients suck
[none]	[03:48]	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, sudo -s
[none]	[03:49]	<TTT_Travis>	is Ubuntu Server Dapper Drake going to be released in the next 24 hours too?
[none]	[03:49]	<delire>	theCore: right, are you talking about 'pinning'?
[none]	[03:49]	<matthew>	i downloaded it to my desktop
[none]	[03:49]	<_tmx_dt2>	whats sudo -s ?
[positive]	[03:49]	<jdub>	todayisagift: always look for packages in ubuntu before going to random websites :)
[none]	[03:49]	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, from the command line
[none]	[03:49]	<Warbo>	jrsims: I think removing your user and adding it again might work better as I think there are important files in your home for logging you into X
[none]	[03:49]	<Flannel>	TTT_Travis: all Dapper versions will be released at the same time
[none]	[03:49]	<theCore>	delire: yea
[none]	[03:49]	<bimberi>	theCore: you can do it in Synaptic via the Package menu (Lock Version)
[none]	[03:49]	<grimboy>	delire: like su
[none]	[03:49]	<delire>	grimboy: i only use btdownloadcurses. i did try azureus for a few months.
[none]	[03:49]	<earthen_>	matthew, what did you download
[none]	[03:49]	<jpatota>	_tmx_dt2, type it then 'vi /etc/fstab'
[positive]	[03:49]	<cowbud>	delire: :)
[none]	[03:49]	<_tmx_dt2>	oh nvm i ran terminal; i think thats the command line prompt you guys are tryn to mention lol
[none]	[03:49]	<cowbud>	jdub: you shit us not eh?
[none]	[03:49]	<theCore>	bimberi: I know but I want to do it in command line
[none]	[03:49]	<ali>	n00b question: i am trying to install mplayer but i am getting this error mplayer-386: Depends: libjack0.80.0-0 (>= 0.99.0) but it is not installable
[none]	[03:49]	<ali>	               Depends: libpolyp0 but it is not installable
[none]	[03:49]	<ali>	E: Broken packages
[none]	[03:49]	<jrsims>	Warbo: ok. do you know the command? is it just a 'useradd'?
[none]	[03:50]	<grimboy>	delire: Oops not you, and thanks
[none]	[03:50]	<matthew>	nero linux
[none]	[03:50]	<earthen_>	matthew, or what are you trying to install
[positive]	[03:50]	<Warbo>	jrsims: either that or adduser :)
[none]	[03:50]	<bimberi>	theCore: ah, missed that bit ...
[none]	[03:50]	<bimberi>	ubotu tell theCore about pinning
[none]	[03:50]	<bkh>	I think useradd is System V way and adduser is BSD style...
[none]	[03:50]	<theCore>	bimberi: thanks
[none]	[03:50]	<ali>	anyone?
[none]	[03:50]	<jrsims>	Warbo: yeah, isn't there a difference - like you can add a user but it won't create a home dir, or something like that? Various adduser options?
[none]	[03:51]	<jdub>	jrsims: what is the problem?
[none]	[03:51]	<earthen_>	matthew, ok then you'll have to read the doc's for that as it is a custom install
[none]	[03:51]	<delire>	theCore: you'll need to specify your pinning in /etc/apt/preferences.
[positive]	[03:51]	<bimberi>	theCore: yw :)
[none]	[03:51]	<matthew>	oh ok
[positive]	[03:51]	<Warbo>	matthew: That isn't really needed as most funtionality is built into the file manager (it won't corrupt your discs like Explorer will) and then there is GnomeBaker and K3b which are very good and already in Ubuntu
[none]	[03:51]	<jrsims>	jdub: login from gdm is fine, but Gnome comes up with just a mouse pointer and background color
[none]	[03:51]	<shane_>	ali - installing via synaptic?
[none]	[03:51]	<earthen_>	matthew,  sorry I can't help with that maybe someone else here installed it
[none]	[03:51]	<Warbo>	jrsims: I honestly don't know (adduser seems fine whenever I use it)
[none]	[03:51]	<todayisagift>	jdub: what do i have to do to the windows machine to allow my unix box to connect
[none]	[03:52]	<jrsims>	Warbo: cool. I'll look at the man page and try that.
[none]	[03:52]	<Flannel>	jrsims: does gnome safe mode work?
[none]	[03:52]	<jdub>	todayisagift: either enable terminal services, or install a vnc server
[none]	[03:52]	<jrsims>	Flannel: hmm. have not tried!
[none]	[03:52]	<earthen_>	matthew,  you can serch in the  Synaptic package manager for another cd burner program though
[none]	[03:52]	<jdub>	jrsims: type ifconfig at the command line -> is there a 'lo' interface listed?
[none]	[03:52]	<shane_>	K3b

[none]	[03:52]	<felipe__>	In which timezone are the guys who update the ubuntu download page. I'm waiting for the dapper link
[none]	[03:53]	<Warbo>	flannel: Doesn't gnome safe mode just turn off any custom startup programs? He can't even log in so I don't think it would help
[none]	[03:53]	<sg47_>	does it work with RC1 too?
[none]	[03:53]	<jdub>	sg47_: there's a server CD which you can use to install; one of the installation choices is 'LAMP server'
[none]	[03:53]	<Flannel>	Warbo: he can't get to GDM? or can't get into gnome?

[none]	[03:53]	<delire>	theCore: there is a manpage on it somewhere. i can't remember right now. you can just use: 'Package: <PackageName>' on one line and then 'Pin: version <version number>' on the line below.
[none]	[03:53]	<Warbo>	Flannel: GNOME (just a pointer on a blank screen)
[none]	[03:53]	<dmbt>	k3b is the best burning software
[none]	[03:53]	<grimboy>	I think the whole, lamp out of the box thing is horribly biased.
[none]	[03:53]	<Warbo>	Flannel: I think it is permission problem
[none]	[03:53]	<jrsims>	Flannel: I get GDM, and login works, then it tries to open gnome and I get just a mouse pointer and the background color. I can move the mouse, but nothing else loads.
[none]	[03:53]	<dmbt>	whether you use gnome or not
[none]	[03:54]	<Flannel>	right, try safe mode.  see if that works.
[none]	[03:54]	<delire>	theCore: i like to use a wildcard for the version number: eg. 'Pin: version 0.6.7.*'
[none]	[03:54]	<shane_>	matthew - K3b is a great app for burning CD/DVDx

[none]	[04:09]	<Warbo>	"OmniDistortion: The only way I could think of messing with MBR would be to do a ""restore"" or something in windows (which would be quite obviously the culprit)"

[none]	[04:09]	<mister_roboto>	shane: I simply could NOT get ubuntu to boot on an old P2-300 so I tried mepis for fun (never saw it before). so far it's running great and is using some dapper repositories too.
[none]	[04:09]	<NoUse>	Antipodean what are you trying to do?
[positive]	[04:09]	<nhaines>	Haha, hiya, Omni.  :)
[none]	[04:09]	<Antipodean>	mount & format a HD
[none]	[04:09]	<earthen_>	Flannel, I have the bluetooth device working and it can see my mouse but the mouse will not move the pointer
[none]	[04:09]	<shane_>	Mr_roboto - i ran mepis for a while and out of the box it was great, but just seemed a bit cluttered
[none]	[04:09]	<NoUse>	Antipodean well you can't format a HD while its mounted
[positive]	[04:09]	<OmniDistortion>	Warbo: I really just don't want to mess with it anymore. I'm not going to dualboot with XP unless I know for sure nothing like that would happen again
[none]	[04:10]	<NoUse>	Antipodean so why don't you just format it
[none]	[04:10]	<mianos>	is ubotu a bot?

[none]	[04:10]	<rixxon>	what means 'software 3.0'? it is mentioned on the fridge
[positive]	[04:10]	<nhaines>	I highly recommend backing up your MBR first.  WinXP had managed to screw mine up, and WinXP recovery console couldn't fix it.  Only a Knoppix CD and a friend who's insane enough to be able to hack the NTFS header by hand could do it.
[none]	[04:10]	<shane_>	and you're right about th eP2 300 support - tried ubuntu on something similar the other day and it didn't work

[none]	[04:27]	<eugman>	Efinian, Nothing.  I've already upgraded. I was just under the impression it be released already and was wondering if there was a reason for having to do it a bit later in the day?
[none]	[04:27]	<Healot>	Warez doesn't exist in Linux-land
[none]	[04:27]	<T-CAN>	hahaha, exactly
[none]	[04:27]	<EmuMatte>	Healot -- ...
[none]	[04:27]	<mumanddad>	what package do i need to install to compile sources?
[none]	[04:27]	<tritium>	warez are also offtopic
[none]	[04:28]	<EmuMatte>	mumanddad -- headers / gcc
[positive]	[04:28]	<bimberi>	mumanddad: build-essential
[none]	[04:28]	<nhaines>	eugman, it takes time to build 4 releases times three projects.
[none]	[04:28]	<Warbo>	Will there be a big upgrade at the release or not, as it is all stabilised now?
[positive]	[04:28]	<tritium>	mumanddad: you'll want to start with build-esential
[none]	[04:28]	<mumanddad>	thanks
[positive]	[04:28]	<mumanddad>	thats the one :-)
[none]	[04:28]	<Warbo>	I mean from current Dapper
[none]	[04:28]	<lukaswayne9>	Is there a server upgrade guide available?
[none]	[04:28]	<Antipodean>	so folks, whats the better filesystem to use ext2, or ext3?
[none]	[04:28]	<jdub>	Warbo: dude, we're like, hours away
[none]	[04:29]	<jdub>	Antipodean: ext3
[none]	[04:29]	<Antipodean>	jdub: thnx
[none]	[04:29]	<Warbo>	Antipodean: ext3, it is the same as ext2 so it is compatible (but has a journal)
[none]	[04:29]	<mcmahons>	ext3
[none]	[04:29]	<Warbo>	jdub: British summer time (take that standardised time!)

[none]	[04:30]	<Efnian>	brandon_, yes
[none]	[04:30]	<OmniD>	what will happen when it's released
[positive]	[04:30]	<lukaswayne9>	i think i'll upgrade my server before the rush :)
[negative]	[04:30]	<tritium>	OmniD: people will rush to download it
[none]	[04:30]	<OmniD>	Aw ubuntu come back
[none]	[04:30]	<nhaines>	warbo: it's pretty much all stable.
[none]	[04:30]	<bimberi>	we all get a pony
[none]	[04:30]	<brandon_>	Efnian, was there some special process involved with installing it?
[negative]	[04:30]	<paradon>	OmniD: The internet will break.
[none]	[04:31]	<OmniD>	I won't be rushing to download it if I don't know if it's released
[none]	[04:31]	<Warbo>	Does anyone know why epiphany would crash every time it tries to load? I've purged and reinstalled and stuff (I almost built from source, but couldn't be bothered to tell it that I have the dependencies)
[none]	[04:31]	<capgadget>	Movie downloads will slow 3% when Dapper is released.
[none]	[04:31]	<Warbo>	nhaines: thx
[none]	[04:31]	<Efnian>	brandon_, I'd imo recommend not to use the repos
[none]	[04:31]	<neoshin>	i want a pony
[none]	[04:31]	<brandon_>	Efnian, the one in the repos doesn't work, the one from the website doesn't work
[none]	[04:32]	<Warbo>	neoshin: apt-get install pony
[none]	[04:32]	<bur[n] er>	anyone know what to use in gconf-editor under the metacity global keybindings to get a binding on Page Up and Page Down?
[none]	[04:32]	<guano>	./configure pony
[none]	[04:32]	<jdub>	Warbo: sudo rm /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/components/compreg.dat
[none]	[04:32]	<Efnian>	brandon_, do you have java installed?
[none]	[04:32]	<Skip>	When I installed dapper 3d acceleration stopped. Using fglrx. Any ideas why?
[none]	[04:32]	<FoX_44470>	When dapper is released ?
[none]	[04:32]	<Efnian>	FoX_44470, today.
[none]	[04:32]	<siccness>	Within 24 hours
[none]	[04:32]	<brandon_>	Efnian, it is installed, yes
[none]	[04:32]	<|Sivik|>	how anyone had any issues with a pci-e card and the x-session going back to the login screen?
[none]	[04:32]	<cge>	FoX_44470: sometime in the next 22 hours or so.
[positive]	[04:33]	<lukaswayne9>	Upgrading my server to dapper now :)
[none]	[04:33]	<|Sivik|>	lukaswayne9, thats cool
[none]	[04:33]	<chapium>	i noticed apt-get update slowed down a bit
[none]	[04:33]	<threat>	is it released yet?
[positive]	[04:33]	<threat>	:P
[none]	[04:33]	<henriquemaia>	Just an advice: would be these daily builds good enough? I have to install Dapper on a friend's computer for her to complete a work for school.
[none]	[04:33]	<chapium>	plus ubuntu.com changed their front page
[none]	[04:34]	<bur[n] er>	henriquemaia: yes
[none]	[04:34]	<Efnian>	brandon_, the one on the website should work by just uncompressing it somewhere within your home directory and running it.
[none]	[04:34]	<henriquemaia>	I don't mind of dist-upgrading later.
[none]	[04:34]	<nhaines>	jdub, is there any way to observe the release process?  Such as the progress of the CD images being built?  Or whatever else they're doing right now?
[none]	[04:34]	<FoX_44470>	yes, because the download page is the same
[none]	[04:34]	<brandon_>	Efnian, so it's just a java issue then?
[none]	[04:34]	<Efnian>	brandon_, how exactly it doesn't work?
[none]	[04:34]	<bkh>	Yeah, there are now 5 people dancing instead of 3...
[none]	[04:34]	<henriquemaia>	Thanks bur[n] er.
[none]	[04:34]	<guano>	henriquemaia skip the daily builds.. install 5.10 and upgrade it, it will install fresh dapper
[none]	[04:34]	<Viaken>	I wish I could dist-upgrade. Dialup isn't dist-upgrade friendly.
[none]	[04:34]	<jdub>	nhaines: not really (mostly because nothing much is happening right now)
[none]	[04:34]	<henriquemaia>	I have done that with... no luck
[none]	[04:34]	<henriquemaia>	The system broke.
[none]	[04:35]	<henriquemaia>	hehe.
[none]	[04:35]	<cge>	henriquemaia: I would use the dailies instead.
[none]	[04:35]	<cge>	henriquemaia: If you can get them... The servers seem rather slow right now.
[none]	[04:35]	<brandon_>	Efnian, it starts and then a popup message thatw e all know and love happens and won't go away, but the application window isn't there, and the tray icon isn't there
[none]	[04:35]	<henriquemaia>	the breezy-dapper dist-upgrade didn't go well.
[positive]	[04:35]	<guano>	i just dist-upgraded a ppc and i'm running true dapper... it's pretty :)
[positive]	[04:35]	<nhaines>	jdub: aww, too bad.  I don't want to pester for ETA, but waiting is easier if you can watch things.  :)
[none]	[04:35]	<cluehammer>	phh real men dist-upgrade over null modem cables
[none]	[04:35]	<Efnian>	brandon_, it think the website one works best with sun's java. do you have it configured?
[none]	[04:35]	<nhaines>	henriquemaia, you shouldn't dist-upgrade from breezy to dapper.
[none]	[04:35]	<chapium>	the progression of ubuntu is like evolution
[none]	[04:36]	<chapium>	first people are naked
[none]	[04:36]	<chapium>	then they where shirts
[none]	[04:36]	<bkh>	Would that be Breezer Drake or Dapper Badger?
[none]	[04:36]	<chapium>	now they wear long sleeves
[none]	[04:36]	<Viaken>	I dist-upgrades from breezy to dapper beta. >.>
[negative]	[04:36]	<henriquemaia>	ist this the link for the daylies? http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/
[none]	[04:36]	<Warbo>	Viaken: It would be good to only have security-updates (but still have access to repos) for dialup users
[none]	[04:36]	<Viaken>	upgraded*
[none]	[04:36]	<chapium>	pretty soon they will be wearing eskimo hats
[none]	[04:36]	<cluehammer>	lol
[positive]	[04:36]	<Viaken>	Warbo: It's a laptop with wireless, so it's not a huge issue. :)
[none]	[04:36]	<brandon_>	Efnian, well obviously it's not properly configured, but i grabbed it from sun's site and replaced the one from the repos by renaming the newer one to the same name as the old version's directory

[none]	[04:47]	<Bilford>	nhaines, is that when the first release was?
[none]	[04:47]	<ubuntu>	and i heard u can do a dual boot, like windows and ubuntu? can hard drive install ubuntu and not erase windows?
[none]	[04:47]	<brandon_>	Efnian, how to get azureus to work, because a lot of people are having java related trouble with it
[none]	[04:47]	<nictuku>	ubuntu, indeed you can
[none]	[04:47]	<chapium>	ubuntu: if the partitions are already setup you probably can
[none]	[04:47]	<pike__>	ubuntu: yes the installer can resize your windows partition and create a new one for ubuntu
[none]	[04:47]	<ubuntu>	how do i do that?
[none]	[04:47]	<ubuntu>	k
[none]	[04:47]	<chapium>	pike__: oooo
[none]	[04:47]	<lukaswayne9>	Does the Ubuntu Desktop CD resize NTFS?
[none]	[04:47]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Ubuntu will see windows and ask if you want to shrink it to make room for Ubuntu (you need free space in Wndows in order to shrink it) then you get a choice when you boot for windows or ubuntu
[none]	[04:48]	<nhaines>	Bilford, no, it started in November, I think, but I usually wait until about four or five months in before trying.
[none]	[04:48]	<mawa>	cool with the chrink feature, does it work well?
[none]	[04:48]	<mawa>	shrink
[none]	[04:48]	<Efnian>	brandon_, noprob, i think the repo one, which is optimized for blackdown java, is fairly easy to install.
[none]	[04:48]	<jaime>	nhaines do you got msn so we can chat
[none]	[04:48]	<ubuntu>	"ok when i clikc on the ""cd"" on the desktop i see a folder that says install, is that what folder i go in?"
[none]	[04:48]	<Efnian>	brandon_, although i prefer the official one, it's cleaner.
[none]	[04:48]	<nhaines>	mawa, yes, it works extremely well.
[none]	[04:48]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: It is much easier to set up with Dapper though, as it has graphics (Breezy install CD is text-based)
[none]	[04:48]	<nhaines>	jaime I do have msn, yes.
[none]	[04:48]	<jaime>	can you add me
[none]	[04:48]	<ubuntu>	oo ok
[none]	[04:48]	<intelikey>	ray__ i'm not 'sure' you need v4l to get that to work.   but  apt-cache search v4l
[none]	[04:49]	<ubuntu>	can i download drapper while i am on the live cd?
[none]	[04:49]	<ubuntu>	then install?
[none]	[04:49]	<jaime>	jaimesdemoyan@hotmail.com
[none]	[04:49]	<slavik>	ubuntu, why?
[none]	[04:49]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: You cannot install from breezy livecd (like you have), it is not hidden away, it is not there
[none]	[04:49]	<ubuntu>	never mind
[none]	[04:49]	<ubuntu>	so i have to download drapper, then burn it to a cd and the ninstall it?
[none]	[04:49]	<intelikey>	ray__ was v4l not an option in the modules section of your config ?
[none]	[04:49]	<jaime>	i have some problems with my ubuntu and i think you can help me fix them
[none]	[04:49]	<slavik>	ubuntu, just wait for the release livecd
[none]	[04:49]	<T-CAN>	has anyone in here tried building a Linux from scratch system?
[none]	[04:49]	<ubuntu>	when is that?
[none]	[04:49]	<mawa>	"is there any ""known"" reason to why would not be able to access the capture controls in alsamixer?"
[positive]	[04:50]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: If you download the Dapper cd you will not be able to save it if you use windows xp (linux cannot write to ntfs partitions) unless you save it to a usb drive or something
[positive]	[04:50]	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: Does Archlinux count? :)
[none]	[04:50]	<paradon>	T-CAN: I did, a long time ago.
[none]	[04:50]	<ubuntu>	what?
[none]	[04:50]	<T-CAN>	how did it turn out?
[none]	[04:50]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: I mean from within the LiveCD
[none]	[04:50]	<ubuntu>	ok
[none]	[04:50]	<paradon>	T-CAN: Initial setup isn't _too_ bad... updates are a b****
[none]	[04:50]	<hassan>	linux from scratch was too hard for me and i've done stage 1 from stage 3 tarball gentoo with no problems
[none]	[04:50]	<T-CAN>	ya, i can imagine
[none]	[04:50]	<ubuntu>	so if i get out of the live cd and use windows and download drapper then burn it to a cd then install it?
[none]	[04:50]	<ray__>	intelikey, that doesn't seem to be what i need. nvidia drivers should work just fine
[none]	[04:50]	<slavik>	hassan: is that your first name?
[none]	[04:51]	<Flannel>	ubuntu: right.
[none]	[04:51]	<nhaines>	jaime, sure, what's your MSN Messenger username?
[none]	[04:51]	<paradon>	As in, I never updated stuff at all unless I really needed to...
[none]	[04:51]	<T-CAN>	hassan, really?
[none]	[04:51]	<ubuntu>	ok
[none]	[04:51]	<ubuntu>	cool
[none]	[04:51]	<hassan>	last name
[none]	[04:51]	<Bilford>	nhaines, when do you think the first Edgy releasse will be
[none]	[04:51]	<ray__>	especially with all the howtos i've seen
[none]	[04:51]	<jaime>	jaimesdemoyan@hotmail.com
[none]	[04:51]	<ubuntu>	whats the big difference between drapper and breazy badger?
[positive]	[04:51]	<Flannel>	Bilford: edgy will release in octover
[none]	[04:51]	<slavik>	nvm then
[none]	[04:51]	<your_mom>	whats the sudo apt to install xorg. it seems i uninstalled, and messed up my whole system, any help pleae
[none]	[04:51]	<intelikey>	ray__ other than the missing v4l  i don't see any thing that looks  amiss
[none]	[04:51]	<Bilford>	Flannel, not official
[none]	[04:51]	<Bilford>	Flannel, testing releases
[none]	[04:51]	<h3h_timo>	has anyone ever tried xubuntu on an xbox?
[none]	[04:51]	<nhaines>	Bilford, probably in a month or so.  But the actual release will be in mid-October.
[none]	[04:51]	<Flannel>	ubuntu: ubuntu.com/testing/dapperbeta
[none]	[04:51]	<Warbo>	your_mom: sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg
[positive]	[04:51]	<paradon>	T-CAN: I went from LinuxFromScratch to SourceMage, which was a huge, huge improvement :-)
[none]	[04:51]	<ubuntu>	ok cool
[none]	[04:51]	<slavik>	"""sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"" to whoever messed up their install"
[none]	[04:52]	<ubuntu>	is it easy to install for a newbie?
[none]	[04:52]	<ray__>	intelikey, say i dl'ed v4l-conf, would i specify something in xorg.conf myself?
[none]	[04:52]	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: arch linux is pretty cool if you want to learn the ins and outs of the system... it's kinda like a binary gentoo
[none]	[04:52]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Yes, just read what it tells you carefully (it is a big step, installing an OS)
[none]	[04:52]	<T-CAN>	paradon, did you try LFS relatively early in your Linux career? did it help you learn a lot?
[none]	[04:52]	<nhaines>	ubuntu: it couldn't be easier.  Get the Desktop CD and then you can boot into it and install it from there.
[none]	[04:52]	<ubuntu>	yea i did damns small linux on my laptop
[none]	[04:52]	<hassan>	t-can yeah. lfs can be done but stick to a guide from the forums
[none]	[04:52]	<ubuntu>	this seems easier
[none]	[04:53]	<ubuntu>	anywho drapper is graphical u said, so that shoudl be easy
[none]	[04:53]	<intelikey>	"ray__ and like i said.  i don't know that you need it,  but you can try adding    section ""Module""   load  v4l"
[none]	[04:53]	<intelikey>	in section modules that is
[none]	[04:53]	<Warbo>	ubuntu: Yep, it uses gparted I think (to shrink windows/create Linux partitions)
[positive]	[04:53]	<nhaines>	Yes, it has a wizard with 7 pages, it asks just a couple questions, and then it goes to work.  :)
[none]	[04:53]	<ubuntu>	and in the graphical interface will it allow me to keep windows?
[none]	[04:53]	<SurfnKid>	I figured out why I was chopping
[none]	[04:53]	<nhaines>	ubuntu: yes.
[none]	[04:53]	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: i would reccommend Arch, I learned a lot from Arch
[none]	[04:53]	<ubuntu>	ok
[none]	[04:53]	<paradon>	T-CAN: Well, I'd been using Redhat 6 as my primary OS for about 2 years, and working as a sysadmin with Mandrake7 servers for about a year, when I installed LFS.  But yeah, I learned a fair bit.
[none]	[04:53]	<ubuntu>	cool thanks for the help
[none]	[04:53]	<ubuntu>	u guys are the best
[none]	[04:53]	<Warbo>	np
[none]	[04:53]	<jaime>	does any know where i can get linux manuals
[none]	[04:54]	<SurfnKid>	3Ddesk creates a burden on the CPU and chops the screensaver so no more 3D desk
[none]	[04:54]	<davidmccabe>	Samsung's support website is 404.
[none]	[04:54]	<ray__>	intelikey, one more question: everytime i save the xorg.conf file, do i have to restart?
[none]	[04:54]	<WoodwardAve>	repos are getting slammed
[none]	[04:54]	<ray__>	in order for changes to show up?
[none]	[04:54]	<intelikey>	only restart X  not a reboot
[none]	[04:54]	<Warbo>	Has anyone tried Gnash? Did they have problems with Macromedia/Adobe Flash since?
[positive]	[04:54]	<SurfnKid>	hey intelikey I got my ATI card going =D now I can do cool graphics
[none]	[04:55]	<intelikey>	ray__ issue  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[none]	[04:55]	<ray__>	i tried hitting ctrl+alt+backspace and i don't know how to get x to start up again
[none]	[04:55]	<cowbud>	"when I do something like xterm -bg black it says color name ""black"" undefined and yet I have a /etc/X11/rgb.txt wtih black in it..any ideas?"
[none]	[04:55]	<Warbo>	ray__: in a console (ctrl-alt-f1) type sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart to restart the graphics without rebooting
[none]	[04:55]	<nhaines>	jaime, I'm sorry, I didn't see your message with your username.  I just added you.
[none]	[04:56]	<T-CAN>	lukaswayne9, so how do I get started with arch?
[none]	[04:56]	<SurfnKid>	Warbo is that how you start the gdm lets say if you dont go directly to the logon screen?
[none]	[04:56]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid good on ya there
[none]	[04:56]	<SurfnKid>	yep mate
[positive]	[04:56]	<Warbo>	"SurfnKid: Yes, it makes any temporary files it needs to (better than typing ""sudo gdm"")"
[none]	[04:56]	<jaime>	speak to me
[negative]	[04:56]	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: http://archlinux.org   They have an excellent guide from installing, setting up the system, and using the core tools
[none]	[04:56]	<jaime>	on msn
[none]	[04:56]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid just venella sudo gdm
[positive]	[04:56]	<PrimoTurbo>	Anyone have any clue on when Ubuntu will be out I want to download it as soon as possible :p
[positive]	[04:56]	<pike__>	cowbud: if you designate a foreground too xterm -fg green -bg black does it work?
[none]	[04:56]	<nhaines>	PrimoTurbo, today.
[none]	[04:57]	<lukaswayne9>	T-CAN: they also have a helpful community at #archlinux
[none]	[04:57]	<SurfnKid>	so If I disable the option to have the logon screen then I'll just have a prompt correct?
[positive]	[04:57]	<Warbo>	SurfnKid: You cannot do that in a GUI though, as it will stop but not start again because the GUI telling it what to do is gone (use stop and start for that)
[positive]	[04:57]	<nhaines>	Even though it messes with my connection lately!  :p
[none]	[04:57]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid yep
[none]	[04:57]	<SurfnKid>	ok cool
[none]	[04:57]	<paradon>	T-CAN: Archlinux is a fairly nice, fairly light, binary distro, with a very nice package build system that's very reminiscent of BSD Ports
[positive]	[04:57]	<SurfnKid>	in case anyone wants to mess with this pc and I know how to get into the gdm =D
[positive]	[04:58]	<Warbo>	SurfnKid: Use start instead of restart if it is not already running
[none]	[04:58]	<cluehammer>	only an hour to go!
[none]	[04:58]	<cowbud>	pike__: it comes up black fine but it complains about not having black defined..
[none]	[04:58]	<SurfnKid>	Warbo I gotcha
[none]	[04:58]	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: i used to be a hardcore archer.. really showed me the ropes of linux
[none]	[04:58]	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: i've made so many arch packages in my day
[none]	[04:58]	<SurfnKid>	so its always better to do it in one of the terminal screens
[none]	[04:58]	<SurfnKid>	cool
[none]	[04:59]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid also of note you might want to start x via the startx command.   that bypasses gdm and puts you right into the wm of your choice (gnome default)
[none]	[04:59]	<DapperDrake>	cluehammer: /topic
[none]	[04:59]	<Beforewisdom>	If I wait until tomorrow will the update manager take care of upgrading Ubuntu for me?
[positive]	[04:59]	<sailorptah>	hello :)  I have an Acer TravelMate 8200 running Breezy Badger here, and it can't seem to find the network card, or the battery.  (It thinks it's running on AC power even when unplugged.  The problem is that I can't see how much power the battery has left.)  Help, please?
[none]	[04:59]	<SurfnKid>	ohh
[none]	[04:59]	<DapperDrake>	please dont ask that
[none]	[04:59]	<Beforewisdom>	;p;
[none]	[04:59]	<Beforewisdom>	lol
[none]	[04:59]	<Beforewisdom>	sorry
[none]	[04:59]	<paradon>	"lukaswayne9: I haven't used it heavily, just on a couple of old machines where I wanted a lightweight distro with XFCE... but I'll almost certainly use it next time I want to make a ""customised"" server distro.  In the past I've used SourceMage... but compiling everything on every machine is annoying."
[none]	[04:59]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid most console users  use   startx  for X sessions
[none]	[04:59]	<SurfnKid>	how do i chose the WM of my choice with startx
[none]	[04:59]	<Warbo>	Beforewisdom: I doubt it. You will need to change breezy to dapper in your sources.list then it will do it
[positive]	[05:00]	<cowbud>	SurfnKid: edit your .xinitrc
[none]	[05:00]	<leonel>	dapper  !!  come out come out wherever you are !
[none]	[05:00]	<SurfnKid>	i see
[none]	[05:00]	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: yeah.. arch has pretty nice optimizations as well
[none]	[05:00]	<SurfnKid>	thatll be homework for later
[none]	[05:00]	<Beforewisdom>	Warbo, I saw a post on slashdot that said the update manager should take care of it, was that post bullshit?
[none]	[05:00]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid you have to have other wm's installed to choose them.
[none]	[05:00]	<lukaswayne9>	paradon: i just installed ubuntu on my server, that's working out pretty nicely
[none]	[05:00]	<SurfnKid>	Im just getting the hang of this OS
[none]	[05:00]	<nhaines>	Beforewisdom, that's not true.  Your Upgrade Manager will let you upgrade automatically.
[none]	[05:00]	<MTecknology>	anybody know off hand what dependencies cvswine needs?
[none]	[05:00]	<SurfnKid>	intelikey, right I have a few already but dont come up on the session options
[none]	[05:00]	<Warbo>	Beforewisdom: If you redirect your update manager from breezy to dapper then it will be fine, you have to redirect it manually though
[none]	[05:01]	<slavik>	-d
[none]	[05:01]	<Shaezsche>	dapper is dumb if it cannot recognize software modems
[none]	[05:01]	<nhaines>	Warbo, that's nto true.  If he redirects it he will break it.
[none]	[05:01]	<leonel>	HEY  dapper  !!  come out come out wherever you are !
[positive]	[05:01]	<Healot>	Shaezsche: no, you are :-
[none]	[05:01]	<Warbo>	"Beforewisdom: There is a file /etc/apt/sources.list which you should open (as super user) and replace any ""breezy"" with ""dapper"" then reload synaptic"
[none]	[05:01]	<Shaezsche>	seriously, how hard is it to program a linux distro to recognize modems?
[none]	[05:01]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid one can for instance issue a command like    startx /usr/bin/xfce4    to open an xfce session    iirc
[none]	[05:02]	<Flannel>	Shaezsche: how hard is it for the modem manufacturers to release the specifications of the modem?
[negative]	[05:02]	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: http://linmodem.org
[none]	[05:02]	<Beforewisdom>	thanks warbo.  I might wait a few days, I can hear servers creaking now
[none]	[05:02]	<nhaines>	Beforewisdom, do not change your sources.list file.  You will break your install.
[positive]	[05:02]	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: Seriously, how hard is it to make a modem that is a modem? :)
[none]	[05:02]	<Shaezsche>	viaken that prog doesnt recognize my modem
[none]	[05:02]	<Healot>	Shaezsche: Real modem, easy, soft modem lacks of driver and even a nit of support from manufacture
[none]	[05:02]	<Shaezsche>	and viaken why isnt that built into ubuntu?
[none]	[05:02]	<nhaines>	Beforewisdom, as soon as 6.06 is released, your update manager will offer to let you upgrade.
[none]	[05:02]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid be sure to tab complete commands like that.
[none]	[05:02]	<SurfnKid>	iirc as in chat?
[none]	[05:02]	<Warbo>	nhaines: My install is fine???
[none]	[05:02]	<SurfnKid>	right full path
[none]	[05:02]	<knanand>	what is de cmd to install rpm packages
[none]	[05:02]	<intelikey>	iirc=if i recall correctly
[none]	[05:02]	<Healot>	alien <rpm file>
[positive]	[05:02]	<Warbo>	knanand: Use alien on them first, and that is a bit dodgy
[none]	[05:02]	<SurfnKid>	oh lol
[none]	[05:02]	<lukaswayne9>	well it's bedtime for me, night all
[none]	[05:03]	<nhaines>	Warbo, there is a special upgrade tool that handles the update and tranistional and obsoleted packages.
[none]	[05:03]	<Warbo>	nhaines: Does it? Cool
[none]	[05:03]	<SurfnKid>	hey is there a command line based IRC that i can get to in case i have trouble thru the terminal
[none]	[05:03]	<Shaezsche>	ubuntu also doesnt recognize laptop card readers
[none]	[05:03]	<Shaezsche>	at least rarely
[none]	[05:03]	<lwarimav>	Can anyone here tell me how to restore my firefox in ubuntu???
[none]	[05:03]	<spikeb>	SurfnKid, irssi
[none]	[05:03]	<SurfnKid>	sweet
[negative]	[05:03]	<henriquemaia>	What's this? ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/
[none]	[05:03]	<SurfnKid>	thx
[none]	[05:03]	<SurfnKid>	might need that when all else fails
[none]	[05:03]	<spikeb>	SurfnKid, i think it is installed by default
[positive]	[05:03]	<SurfnKid>	cuz im definitely not bootin to WXP
[none]	[05:03]	<SurfnKid>	ahh
[none]	[05:04]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid several in fact.  even xchat has a text mode
[none]	[05:04]	<SurfnKid>	oh
[none]	[05:04]	<knanand>	Warbo: is it alien <pkg_name> ??
[negative]	[05:04]	<WhatTheDeuce>	Hey.  I'm having some trouble getting cl-curl working.  I've installed libcurl3-dev, cl-uffi, and cl-asdf, but when I try (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op :curl) (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :curl) I get errors
[none]	[05:04]	<SurfnKid>	yeah something so i can crank up and ask for help
[none]	[05:04]	<Healot>	Is anyone here who dumb enough to ask question about proprietary hardware?
[none]	[05:04]	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: These things are not so simple as you seem to think. Manufacturers worldwide are making their own, custom interfaces and hardware and not providing any documentation or help for people wanting to interface it. It's like trying to learn an alien language with no training programs, no books, just a native speaker that can't understand you, either.
[none]	[05:04]	<intelikey>	SurfnKid i'm using bx as we speak
[none]	[05:04]	<lwarimav>	How can I restore firefox???
[none]	[05:04]	<chron>	what is the gnome browser called?
[positive]	[05:04]	<Warbo>	"knanand: You need the rpm file in the directory your terminal is in (default is home) then ""sudo alien packagefile.rpm"""
[none]	[05:04]	<chron>	the command
[none]	[05:04]	<pike__>	lwarimav: what mean you restore? an easy workaround would be just download the updated firefox to your home directory and run it from there
[none]	[05:05]	<chron>	on ubuntu
[none]	[05:05]	<nhaines>	chron, epiphany
[none]	[05:05]	<intelikey>	lwarimav restore ?

[none]	[05:07]	<sailorptah>	Can anyone tell me how to get my laptop to detect the network card?  Or the battery?
[none]	[05:07]	<Warbo>	lwarimav: Has it been installed through Synapic/apt? Then I would try a complete removel (--purge) and reinstall if the problem persists
[none]	[05:07]	<nhaines>	nbx909, that is probably the release candidate.
[none]	[05:07]	<nbx909>	no it's not
[none]	[05:07]	<nbx909>	look at it
[none]	[05:07]	<nbx909>	the release clients have rc
[none]	[05:07]	<chron>	"""epiphany: command not found"""
[none]	[05:07]	<chron>	you sure thats the browser?
[none]	[05:07]	<Shaezsche>	its an alternate install iso
[none]	[05:07]	<Healot>	read the release document yet?
[none]	[05:07]	<lwarimav>	thank Warbo... I'll try that
[none]	[05:07]	<Shaezsche>	its rc
[none]	[05:07]	<chron>	or is it nautilus?
[none]	[05:07]	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: It's got 3D acceleration built into the kernel for intel I think
[none]	[05:07]	<sailorptah>	Okay, how about this: Can anyone HEAR me?  Are these messages coming through?
[none]	[05:07]	<knanand>	Warbo: alien cmd not found.
[negative]	[05:07]	<nbx909>	sailorptah, ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
[none]	[05:08]	<sailorptah>	Ah, thank you.
[negative]	[05:08]	<nbx909>	Shaezsche, ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
[none]	[05:08]	<intelikey>	lwarimav i'm not sure what you are wanting to restore though ?    if you mean reinstall it.  then apt-get purge it and then install ubuntu-desktop  but if you have broken it locally that wont help you.    test this.  do sudo useradd something && sudo passwd something     logout and login as something with the passwd you set.  then start ff and see if the break is local or system.
[none]	[05:08]	<Warbo>	chron: Epiphany is GNOME's favourite browser, but Ubuntu uses firefox (type it)
[none]	[05:08]	<chron>	i'm trying to drag and drop files as root, how would i do this?
[none]	[05:08]	<nbx909>	it has the rc along with all of them
[positive]	[05:08]	<Warbo>	knanand: You need to install it (sudo apt-get install alien)
[none]	[05:08]	<sizzymia>	i'm trying to print to my photo tray with a HP photosmart 7760 and it won't work.  I can print with the normal tray, but not the photo tray.  any ideas?
[none]	[05:08]	<lwarimav>	ok intelikey
[none]	[05:09]	<SurfnKid>	I just thougght of this today, maybe you all have, but the fact that running an OS where you have no clue whats on the background, except maybe limited to only killing processes and viewing CPU time and load has made me think of linux now, it gets you involved, you actually know what is the pc loading to, module wise and processes wise, and if something fails even then you can code your way out of a crash
[none]	[05:09]	<kaled>	hmm, where are the .torrents?
[none]	[05:09]	<chron>	if you run nautilus as root
[none]	[05:09]	<argpirate>	anyone know where to get a newer version of kxdocker?
[none]	[05:09]	<chron>	are you looking at screw ups?
[none]	[05:09]	<intelikey>	lwarimav if it works for something  you have files in your normal users $HOME  that are causing the issue.  else it's a system break
[none]	[05:09]	<Warbo>	chron: Yes, especially for a newbie
[none]	[05:09]	<chron>	i'm trying to drag and drop files as root
[positive]	[05:09]	<SurfnKid>	just a thought =D
[none]	[05:09]	<chron>	how can i do this?
[none]	[05:09]	<Flannel>	chron: gksudo nautilus
[none]	[05:09]	<Warbo>	chron: What files?
[none]	[05:10]	<chron>	ok thanks
[none]	[05:10]	<chron>	just alot of files
[none]	[05:10]	<chron>	from one hd to another
[none]	[05:10]	<Warbo>	chron: i mean, why do you need root?
[positive]	[05:10]	<Flannel>	chron: just be careful ;)
[positive]	[05:10]	<bkh>	SurfnKid: Yeah, having a system that isn't designed to hide things from you is a definite plus when you're learning this stuff...
[none]	[05:10]	<Warbo>	chron: Set the permissions properly and you have solved the underlying issue
[none]	[05:10]	<chron>	thats what i'm trying to get him to do
[positive]	[05:11]	<bkh>	I certainly learned alot my first time using linux... but then, that was with slackware back around kernel 0.83 or so :)

[none]	[05:11]	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: That's probably in the wiki, too, if you want more details.
[none]	[05:12]	<Harold_P>	So far all the links I've gotten, even the .pool one seem to be RC's
[none]	[05:12]	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: Install the source and go to it, then configure it and make it and use the bzImage it makes as your kernel
[none]	[05:12]	<Shaezsche>	navigating that wiki is daunting
[none]	[05:12]	<Shaezsche>	thanks
[none]	[05:12]	<Shaezsche>	what do you mean install the source? shouldnt it automatically be installed if i am running the operating system
[none]	[05:12]	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: I think it is in /lib/modules/<kernelversion>/build as well (linked)
[none]	[05:12]	<Shaezsche>	ok
[none]	[05:12]	<intelikey>	Shaezsche lol
[none]	[05:13]	<nhaines>	No, Shaezsche, only the binaries are installed when you run the OS.
[none]	[05:13]	<chapium>	help, the X just switched to 640x480 and i forgot the key combination that changes it.  Everything is huge now!
[none]	[05:13]	<Shaezsche>	well, how do i install the source? must it be dled?
[negative]	[05:13]	<Viaken>	Shaezsche: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCompileHowto?highlight=%28kernel%29
[none]	[05:13]	<Warbo>	Shaezsche: No, the source is about 40MB+ which is not really needed. For building programs the linux-headers package suffices
[none]	[05:13]	<Shaezsche>	thanks via lol
[negative]	[05:13]	<nosklo>	hmm seems like final version is here ftp://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ ?
[none]	[05:13]	<Shaezsche>	NO nosklo stfu

[none]	[05:13]	<Shaezsche>	that was an alternate install version
[none]	[05:13]	<RTB|Waiting4Dapr>	?_o
[none]	[05:13]	<offby1>	is it straightforward to upgrade Debian Sarge to Dapper?
[none]	[05:13]	<Shaezsche>	i know nothing about linux but i KNOW thats  a RC
[none]	[05:13]	<intelikey>	Shaezsche you could install the full linux source tree including the source for all apps........  got a few tara to waste.
[none]	[05:14]	<intelikey>	?
[none]	[05:14]	<Warbo>	offby1: no
[none]	[05:14]	<nosklo>	"it doesnt have the ""rc' tag in the filename"
[none]	[05:14]	<nbx909>	Shaezsche, the alternate verson means just a text install
[none]	[05:14]	<offby1>	Warbo: is there anything written about it, or should I not even try?
[none]	[05:14]	<nosklo>	and the modify date is today

[none]	[05:14]	<SurfnKid>	the Molecule screen saver has got me so hooked, im lovin it
[none]	[05:14]	<Warbo>	offby1: Well, I would recommend starting from scratch with Dapper, but if you don't mind wasting a bit of time you could have a go and learn a bit
[none]	[05:14]	<Viaken>	intelikey: I run Gentoo on my desktop. All the source is on it, and it only takes up 6G.
[none]	[05:15]	<Healot>	just let Mark announce the release...

[none]	[05:15]	<Bilford>	Mark Shuttleworth is going to announce it in here?
[none]	[05:15]	<Warbo>	offby1: PAckages are given different names and are built with different versions of glibc and stuff, meaning that they all conflict and the ones which do install may not work right
[none]	[05:16]	<GreedyUbuntuFrea>	ssh I think
[positive]	[05:16]	<pike__>	mumanddad: im partial to freenx

[none]	[05:23]	<nefelim>	what is qt?
[none]	[05:23]	<Warbo>	nefelim: The buttons and stuff KDE uses. GNOME uses GTK, they use different themes and stuff

[none]	[05:26]	<nefelim>	well okay maybe i will try kde but if im not satisfied is it easy to uninstall it?
[none]	[05:26]	<Bilford>	Flannel, whats wrong
[none]	[05:26]	<Roger_The_Bum>	Funkmon, did you burn the ISO correctly?
[none]	[05:26]	<pike__>	nefelim: take a look at xubuntu too..

[none]	[05:27]	<DShepherd>	nefelim: its kooler
[none]	[05:27]	<Eroick>	nefelim: it is ubuntu running xfce
[none]	[05:27]	<_nano_>	chron: the sixth column...it's the fsck column
[none]	[05:27]	<pike__>	nefelim: its xfce more lighweight
[none]	[05:27]	<nhaines>	Eroick, it is on the CD, yes.
[positive]	[05:27]	<Flannel>	Bilford: well, they are selling optionally, but it's still poorly worded.
[none]	[05:27]	<Shaezsche>	xubu is supposed to be fast

[none]	[05:27]	<Viaken>	xfce is nifty.
[positive]	[05:27]	<nhaines>	Eroick, but pretending it isn't, you could go to packages.ubuntu.com and search for it under dapper, if you had to.  :)

[none]	[05:45]	<earthen_>	pike__, thanks anyway I'm one step further so it's a start
[positive]	[05:45]	<nhaines>	bkh, they need the images to be ready before they can create a torrent.  ;)

[none]	[05:45]	<cluehammer>	yar
[none]	[05:45]	<intelikey>	beniamino i can advise, that; there are some really good network adm's that hange in ##linux

[none]	[05:48]	<Bung>	mcmahons: ill check it out, i was hoping for one that still let you select files within the torrent
[none]	[05:49]	<glick>	scuse me, i really dig the ubuntu icon set, for dapper, but are they avaiable in any other color other then puke orange?
[none]	[05:49]	<argpirate>	if you are already running dapper beta yoou should just be able to upgrade like normal aye?

[none]	[05:49]	<word>	Just that if I skip it with ctrl+c there are no problems but otherwise i get those errors when it starts up the volume manager..is there anyway to try and reinstall just the vol manager to see if that would fix it?

[none]	[05:49]	<Hisakasex>	wich is the parameter that indicates the directory where the errors and warnings of resources/software are going to be logged in

[none]	[05:49]	<majd>	Hi, i've already installed LAMP before but it was very messy and i want you'r guys' input, what's the best, easiest way to install apache2/mysql/php? (I don't want to use a prepackage like LAMPP cause that just complicates things later on)
[none]	[05:50]	<wormsarm>	and how I compile them?

[none]	[05:50]	<Viaken>	Bung: freeloader doesn't. rtorrent does, I think.
[none]	[05:50]	<majd>	Flannel, is it any different under dapper?
[none]	[05:50]	<glick>	i dont like it
[none]	[05:50]	<nhaines>	Dapper's Human theme is so much nicer.  I got used to it.
[none]	[05:50]	<Hisakasex>	wich is the main.cf (postfix) parameter that indicates the directory where the errors and warnings of resources/software are going to be logged in?
[positive]	[05:50]	<Flannel>	people complaining about orange?  heh, first brown, now orange.  What color would you be satisfied with? ;)

[none]	[05:50]	<nhaines>	glick, then use Clearlooks.
[none]	[05:50]	<Bung>	Viaken: good to know, thanks !

[none]	[05:52]	<NickGarvey>	thank you DarkTower
[none]	[05:52]	<_Grout>	what about 0:01 UTC
[none]	[05:52]	<Bugs>	NickGarvey:  not sure what you are referring to...i have been running it for awhile and it's brilliant - have you tried it ?
[none]	[05:52]	<Roger_The_Bum>	maybe
[none]	[05:52]	<mecca>	does Ubuntu not support PCF fonts?
[none]	[05:52]	<FLeiXiuS>	Dapper is out tomorrow eh?  Or...is it a specific time EST?

[none]	[05:52]	<T313C0mun1s7>	So nobody that is good with Crossover Office isssues?
[none]	[05:52]	<paradon>	My wild-ass guess is 0700 UTC, since IIRC that's when Breezy came out.
[none]	[05:52]	<jaime>	nhaines sorry i closed the conversation i tried to fine you but  i cant so if you can talk to me on msn open the conversation again please

[none]	[05:53]	<Efnian>	nbx909, i didn't notice the filename, interesting.
[none]	[05:53]	<DarkTower>	nbx909: THEN THEY ARE THE SAME
[none]	[05:53]	<rredd4>	Bilford, not here
[none]	[05:53]	<Phuzion>	Can someone tell me how to upgrade my distro easily with apt-get?
[positive]	[05:53]	<ggilbert>	It probably is going to correspond to whenever the PR person gets up this morning :p
[none]	[05:53]	<steveneddy>	I just don't see it on the DL pages yet...
[none]	[05:53]	<DarkTower>	oops sorry for shouting all
[none]	[05:53]	<Viaken>	Roger_The_Bum: That'd be 12:00 UTC, so hopefully they'd have it out by then.
[none]	[05:53]	<nbx909>	DarkTower, that just means the daily build was the final build lol
[none]	[05:53]	<RTB|Sleep>	ok
[none]	[05:53]	<Bilford>	It doesnt really amtter if it's the final or not
[none]	[05:53]	<RTB|Sleep>	est? bien
[none]	[05:53]	<Bilford>	it will just download a few minor updates
[none]	[05:53]	<nbx909>	Efnian, yes i noted earlier when people were talking about it that the names don't match
[none]	[05:53]	<RTB|Sleep>	buenas noches
[none]	[05:53]	<T313C0mun1s7>	-Dapper will be released prior to midnight June 2nd in a timezone other than yours.

[none]	[05:54]	<cluehammer>	hmmm i'm hungry
[none]	[05:54]	<Bilford>	I think the only difference between today's daily build and Final Release is about a few megs of extra updates to download
[none]	[05:54]	<Phuzion>	rredd4:  invalid operation
[none]	[05:54]	<cluehammer>	apt-get hamburger
[none]	[05:54]	<majd>	I marked the xorg-driver-fglrx package to be removed earlier and i can't seem to unmark it..any idea why?
[none]	[05:54]	<Bugs>	cluehammer:  lol
[none]	[05:55]	<rredd4>	Phuzion sudo apt-get distro-update

[none]	[05:55]	<intelikey>	hmm could have used sed and done an enline edit.
[none]	[05:55]	<cef>	nbx909: create 2 .iso files at different times of exactly the same data
[none]	[05:56]	<nbx909>	cef, well then that means the daily build was the same exact thing as the final build lol
[none]	[05:56]	<nbx909>	i don't see your point
[none]	[05:56]	<nbx909>	lol
[none]	[05:56]	<kaled>	if Ubuntu there's pacakge named 'moo' in apt repositories, how do you install it with apt-get?

[none]	[05:57]	<ChangerO1Sea>	hey... how long until dapper comes out?
[none]	[05:57]	<kaled>	hmm, it won't work
[none]	[05:57]	<jbroome>	stab
[none]	[05:57]	<cef>	DarkTower: meh. I grabbed that about 4 hrs ago
[none]	[05:57]	<nbx909>	Flannel, what am i ttelling people i having told anyone else after you told me not to
[positive]	[05:57]	<Viaken>	That keeps you from having to edit it by hand. :P
[none]	[05:57]	<pike__>	ChangerO1Sea: 14 days
[positive]	[05:57]	<cluehammer>	i bet mark shuttleworth just dumps his cvs every couple of months and that's the new release :-), the artwork is probably whatever his kids have got on the fridge
[none]	[05:57]	<nhaines>	! tell ChangerO1Sea about dapper

[none]	[05:57]	<cluehammer>	nope, still in the closet
[none]	[05:57]	<glick>	so the ubuntu icons arnt available in any other color?
[none]	[05:57]	<intelikey>	Phuzion the fully automatic way.                                                                                      sed 's/breezy/dapper/g' /etc/apt/sources.list > sources.list && sudo cp sources.list /etc/apt/ && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && echo success || echo failed.

[none]	[05:57]	<rredd4>	Phuzion -->  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[05:58]	<Bugs>	hey, anyone use GIMPSHOP ?
[none]	[05:58]	<JabberWokky>	"ChangerO1Sea: Your ""tonight"" isn't everybody elses."
[none]	[05:58]	<MTecknology>	What makes EMACS different from gedit?
[none]	[05:58]	<nbx909>	Flannel, that's why i was spaming it, i'm acually a very good irc user in smaller crowds lol
[none]	[05:58]	<ChangerO1Sea>	ok.. well its 1158 here now
[none]	[05:58]	<Flannel>	MTecknology: emacs is an OS.  gedit is a text editor
[none]	[05:58]	<cluehammer>	gedit isn't an operating system
[positive]	[05:58]	<Bugs>	MTecknology:  asprin :)
[none]	[05:58]	<ggilbert>	MTecknology: Well, both can edit text. That's about where the similarities end
[positive]	[05:58]	<Viaken>	intelikey: Was mine wrong? :P
[none]	[05:58]	<Healot>	emacs is old, cli-orirented...
[none]	[05:58]	<ChangerO1Sea>	so i have to wait how long?
[none]	[05:58]	<JabberWokky>	MTecknology: weevils.  And lots of extra keypresses.  Too much to answer in a line on IRC.
[positive]	[05:58]	<Chobo-Mog>	hey, could someone explain what the differences are between 6.06 Flight-7 and LTS, please?
[none]	[05:58]	<OmniD>	gedit isn't an operating system?!?!?!
[none]	[05:58]	<OmniD>	MY LIFE IS A LIE
[none]	[05:59]	<Viaken>	ChangerO1Sea: However long it may take?
[none]	[05:59]	<intelikey>	Viaken no i just updated mine from the first time i answered.
[none]	[05:59]	<cluehammer>	emacs causes cancer, sterility, and carpal tunnel, gedit just does eyestrain
[none]	[05:59]	<Bugs>	cluehammer:  LOL
[positive]	[05:59]	<dr_willis>	OmniD:  its not.. but emacs is. :P
[none]	[05:59]	<yappa>	I wonder if Dapper is already just waiting to go but they're holding off to build suspense.
[none]	[05:59]	<sloof3>	well?
[positive]	[05:59]	<Viaken>	heh :) Just checking. I'm not a sed wizard yet, but I'm aspiring.
[none]	[05:59]	<DarkTower>	emacs is cooler
[none]	[05:59]	<sloof3>	It be 00:00
[none]	[05:59]	<Flannel>	Chobo-Mog: no differences, well, flight7 isn't the final release, still a beta.
[none]	[05:59]	<MTecknology>	JabberWokky, is emacs more of a programming tool?
[none]	[05:59]	<Bugs>	GimpShop ?  Anyone, anyone ???
[none]	[05:59]	<cluehammer>	i bet dapper is just a VERY belated april fools joke
[none]	[05:59]	<T313C0mun1s7>	but gedit is hotter
[none]	[05:59]	<DShepherd>	yappa: mmmm maybe
[none]	[05:59]	<crimsun>	yappa: no, we're waiting for the majority of mirrors to finish rsyncing.
[none]	[05:59]	<DarkTower>	MTecknology: yes more programming
[none]	[05:59]	<cluehammer>	nein, gvim
[none]	[05:59]	<bobessutio>	mirrors?
[none]	[05:59]	<Healot>	cluehammer: yeah a joke
[none]	[05:59]	<MTecknology>	ty
[positive]	[06:00]	<pike__>	MTecknology: the only thing they really have in common is sucking when compared to vi :)
[none]	[06:00]	<Flannel>	MTecknology: no, they're both.  emacs has a lot of scriptability built in, which has caused people to go crazy and code everything in emacs script (games, browsers, etc).
[none]	[06:00]	<DarkTower>	pike__: lol
[none]	[06:00]	<JabberWokky>	MTecknology: emacs is a total environment, a la KDE or Gnome, but text oriented.  It has web browsers, games, pim software, quantuum mechanics tools, etc. (And I'm serious about the last -- that's what my fiance uses it for)
[none]	[06:00]	<cluehammer>	admittedly, i bet it wasn't just the scripting part of emacs that drove them batty
[none]	[06:00]	<Flannel>	JabberWokky: nah, it's an editor, just with scripting hooks.
[none]	[06:00]	<DarkTower>	JabberWokky: emacs is not like KDE or gnome, thats silly
[none]	[06:00]	<Phuzion>	Yeah umm, every time I try to do something among the lines of apt-get update or upgrade-dist, it fails saying couldn't stat source package list
[none]	[06:00]	<Bugs>	"pike__:  incorrect, ""vi"" suck, ""emacs"" blows"

[none]	[06:00]	<brett>	Anyone know a good tool to convert AVI to MP4 (ipod)
[none]	[06:00]	<Ademan>	anyone know why i can only play one sound source at a time? like if i have rhythmbox up, nothing in firefox will play, and vice versa
[none]	[06:01]	<cluehammer>	lol
[positive]	[06:01]	<ggilbert>	Someone did implement tetris in vim :p
[none]	[06:01]	<MTecknology>	is there any need for me to really learn to use emacs?
[none]	[06:01]	<bkh>	The icon for emacs is a kitchen sink for a very good reason
[none]	[06:01]	<_Grout>	!offtopic
[none]	[06:01]	<nhaines>	chobo: lots of live CD installer fixes.
[none]	[06:01]	<cluehammer>	Ademan because of the horror known as esd
[none]	[06:01]	<DarkTower>	MTecknology: if you want to program in it
[positive]	[06:01]	<bur[n] er>	brett: if you find it, yell with some excitement, i've been curious ;)
[none]	[06:01]	<esc_ape>	does anyone know if rufus is allowed on oink?
[none]	[06:01]	<intelikey>	Phuzion pastebin your sources.list
[none]	[06:01]	<crimsun>	rredd4: as part of the development team.
[none]	[06:01]	<ggilbert>	MTecknology: not really. It's a nice program that you could learn, but there is no necessary reason
[none]	[06:01]	<Ademan>	cluehammer: whats wrong with it? should i use oss?
[positive]	[06:01]	<Viaken>	Anyone in here played with bastet? XD That's some mean Tetris.

[none]	[06:01]	<rredd4>	crimsun cool!!
[none]	[06:01]	<JabberWokky>	DarkTower: It's an environment, complete with an application base.
[none]	[06:01]	<Chobo-Mog>	ahh...thanks
[none]	[06:01]	<cluehammer>	Ademan nah, you want to google dmix thouhg if you have breezy it should already be there

[none]	[06:02]	<Ademan>	i've got dapper... so...
[none]	[06:02]	<brett>	burner, plenty in windows... but linux converters seem hard to find
[none]	[06:02]	<cluehammer>	Ademan they stuffed esd on one channel and left another open, but some programs like to hog the sound device all to themselves
[none]	[06:02]	<crimsun>	cef: wouldn't they?
[none]	[06:02]	<Phuzion>	intelikey:  Yeah
[positive]	[06:02]	<ggilbert>	What I'd personally love is a gvim with gnome-vfs support :p
[none]	[06:02]	<T313C0mun1s7>	gedit and emacs are the same: emacs was made because Stalman is a programmer, gedit was made because Stalman is a programmer - see, the same
[none]	[06:02]	<Ademan>	cluehammer: seems like just about everything
[none]	[06:02]	<Chobo-Mog>	I was just asking because I saw the flight-7 version online and I thought dapper had finally been released...i guess it was just the beta
[none]	[06:02]	<cluehammer>	Ademan dunno in dapper, isn't out yet
[none]	[06:02]	<rredd4>	does any one use a laptop with nvidia geforce 2?

[none]	[06:04]	<Viaken>	brett: I'm sure there's a way to convert it in Linux, but I don't know how. It would probably amount to piping a decoder to an encoder, tho.

[positive]	[06:08]	<nhaines>	T313C0mun1s7, there was no code freeze.  :)
[none]	[06:08]	<khermans>	i always recommend separate /home !!!
[none]	[06:08]	<ggilbert>	T313C0mun1s7: If you're up to date, then you have basically the release.

[none]	[06:09]	<Phuzion>	Same problem
[none]	[06:09]	<jobezone>	gaim should highlight messages with our nickname. It's hard to see if anyone is talking to mee.
[none]	[06:09]	<intelikey>	Phuzion then update and dist-upgrade.....  but i'd wait the 6 or so hours till the release is out.
[none]	[06:09]	<Hmmmm>	when does xubuntu a la dapper get released? wanted to see how much faster it runs than gnome
[none]	[06:09]	<mnvl>	did dapper come out yet?
[none]	[06:09]	<kambei>	I'm not interested in using cedega.  I would just like openGL to work with wine.

[none]	[06:12]	<jobezone>	Bung: that's weird... did you install from the repositories? If so, you could report that as a bug in launchpad.net .
[none]	[06:12]	<nhaines>	Phuzion, don't change your sources.list file.  If you want to upgrade to Dapper early, then just run gksudo update-manager -r
[none]	[06:12]	<sherlock-holmes>	there is no new information....i waited for nothing...man i am tired...
[none]	[06:13]	<Bung>	jobezone: i dunno, it was in synaptic, so i presume it was from repositories?

[none]	[06:18]	<onkarshinde>	khermans: Read the channel topic
[none]	[06:18]	<matthew_w>	Also, what the heck is up with sound in Ubuntu.  Every application is crashing like crazy whenever it needs the sound device, or, it can't find the sound device, so I have so start/kill ESD a million times before anything works.  What am I doing wrong?
[none]	[06:18]	<Ademan>	crimsun: aplay does work that way
[none]	[06:18]	<FunnyLookinHat>	matthew_w: are you using dapper or breezy?
[none]	[06:18]	<crimsun>	Ademan: then alsa & dmix are fine for your chipset.
[none]	[06:18]	<Vaske_Car>	crimsun, im a bit confused now... it say that Ubuntu is suported 18months..., is there separate server version that is suported 5 years?
[none]	[06:19]	<nhaines>	matthew_w, you should configure dmix correctly.
[none]	[06:19]	<khermans>	crimsun, no it doesnt -- ok so i'll change it

[none]	[06:19]	<FunnyLookinHat>	matthew_w: never had any issues liek that for dapper beta

[none]	[06:19]	<T313C0mun1s7>	Is that what my problem with Listen is tonight - I have to kill it every 5 minutes
[none]	[06:19]	<nhaines>	matthew_w, 6.06 fixes this problem in most cases.

[none]	[06:20]	<Phuzion>	Same problem
[none]	[06:20]	<intelikey>	Phuzion that is not a sources.list error.  that is a network error.
[none]	[06:20]	<Ademan>	crimsun: what did you mean by the second part? is that... the command to start up firefox?
[negative]	[06:20]	<Vaske_Car>	crimsun, how do I download server version??? I tried here http://www.ubuntu.com/download but it offer standard 5.10 version, it does not say that it is server version...  ?????

[none]	[06:20]	<FunnyLookinHat>	Vaske_Car: try going to the links from ubuntu.com concerning the server..
[none]	[06:20]	<KurtKraut>	Vaske_Car, server version is for Ubuntu Dapper (codenome of 6.06)
[none]	[06:21]	<FunnyLookinHat>	if those don't work it's becaues it's not relased
[none]	[06:21]	<Phuzion>	I forgot to set my network settings totally
[none]	[06:21]	<KurtKraut>	Vaske_Car, codename I mean
[none]	[06:21]	<rredd4>	intelikey maybe Phuzion can use apt spy
[none]	[06:21]	<matthew_w>	Ah good, Dapper's out soon.  I'll just sudo apt-get dist-upgrade soon
[none]	[06:21]	<intelikey>	rredd4 yeah
[positive]	[06:21]	<Viaken>	Phuzion: Then that might be your problem. ;)

[none]	[06:21]	<crimsun>	Ademan: yes

[none]	[06:22]	<nhaines>	Vaske_Car, the new version will be called 6.06 LTS
[none]	[06:22]	<Vaske_Car>	crimsun, any idea when it will be released?
[none]	[06:22]	<zcat[1] >	what's LTS stand for?
[none]	[06:22]	<rredd4>	Meshezabeel  to hard for you?!
[none]	[06:22]	<onkarshinde>	Vaske_Car: Wrong. Once dapper is released latest stable version will be 6.06
[none]	[06:22]	<crimsun>	zcat[1] : long term support
[none]	[06:22]	<JabberWokky>	zcat[1] : Long Term Support
[none]	[06:23]	<zcat[1] >	Ahhhhh..
[none]	[06:23]	<czambran>	Seveas: any development on the release?
[none]	[06:23]	<crimsun>	Vaske_Car: sometime in the next 8-12 hours, most likely
[none]	[06:23]	<nhaines>	!tell Vaske_Car about dapper
[none]	[06:23]	<MTecknology>	There going to be a shit load of updates the first few weeks for dapper?
[none]	[06:23]	<Meshezabeel>	rredd4, yeah, it is a bit hard, I'm just glad I don't have to type sudo or something silly like that!
[none]	[06:23]	<pjw>	onkarshinde: when will it be?
[positive]	[06:23]	<Meshezabeel>	;)
[none]	[06:23]	<zcat[1] >	In another 8 hours is will be 2/6 here !!
[negative]	[06:23]	<nbx909>	for those who don't think that http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185570 is the latest stable verson here is a screen shot of it running in vmware http://kimages.be/share/87459560.png i
[none]	[06:23]	<intelikey>	i just was using hoary, and so i uninstalled ubuntu-base and did a dist-upgrade to dapper skipping breezy  and i don't reccomend that anyone else try that... but it worked well.
[none]	[06:23]	<onkarshinde>	pjw: Sometime today
[none]	[06:23]	<crimsun>	pjw: it's difficult to release something that doesn't exist!
[none]	[06:23]	<Bilford>	best guess for release time is in 2 hours 37 minutes
[none]	[06:23]	<Viaken>	!tell Viaken about dapper
[none]	[06:23]	<meddlepal>	Hey, when Dapper is released, just wondering what command I should execute to download and install? Is it going to be the same update-manager -d switch as with the RC?
[none]	[06:23]	<rredd4>	Meshezabeel  are you root, if not type sudo
[none]	[06:23]	<Viaken>	well that wasn't helpful. lol
[none]	[06:23]	<MTecknology>	!Dapper
[none]	[06:23]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
[positive]	[06:23]	<z4k4ri4>	Dapper will be released on 6:06, the question is in what timezone :)
[none]	[06:24]	<czambran>	meddlepal: you shouldn';t need the 'd' switch
[positive]	[06:24]	<crimsun>	Bilford: that's pretty optimistic, considering our core-devs will still be asleep.
[none]	[06:24]	<nhaines>	nbx909, the betas have looked like that for the last two weeks.
[none]	[06:24]	<MTecknology>	lol
[none]	[06:24]	<onkarshinde>	z4k4ri4: Read ubotu reply
[none]	[06:24]	<khermans>	crimsun, guess i am wrong -- maybe Dapper will be out at 3:53 accroding to the .pool directories on the releases.ubuntu.com site
[positive]	[06:24]	<ajax4>	Its 6/6 on the East Coast :)
[none]	[06:24]	<PrimoTurbo>	Can anyone confirm that .pool is the same as the final?
[none]	[06:24]	<Bilford>	crimsun, they should still be up partying
[none]	[06:24]	<ajax4>	Err, 6/1 that is.
[none]	[06:24]	<intelikey>	Phuzion why do you have breezy cd in that list ?
[none]	[06:24]	<Flannel>	PrimoTurbo: it's not.
[none]	[06:24]	<intelikey>	oooops
[none]	[06:24]	<khermans>	crimsun, since it seems to be uploaded very frequently around that time
[none]	[06:24]	<JabberWokky>	"ajax4: I was wondering ""East coast of *what* is 6/6?!??!"""
[none]	[06:24]	<Flannel>	PrimoTurbo: its todays daily build
[none]	[06:25]	<PrimoTurbo>	I see
[none]	[06:25]	<rredd4>	intelikey Phuzion (i=Phuzion8@69-168-170-76.clvdoh.adelphia.net) has left #ubuntu
[none]	[06:25]	<nbx909>	nhaines, they said thank you for your interest in ubuntu released in june 2006?
[none]	[06:25]	<PrimoTurbo>	man this is annoying I see a thread about the final
[none]	[06:25]	<ajax4>	Jabber: hehe, typo!
[none]	[06:25]	<Vaske_Car>	Here is why i ask about server version: If i run server with 5.10 after 3 years I will not be able to update it no more, right?
[none]	[06:25]	<intelikey>	rredd4 see the oooops ?
[none]	[06:25]	<T313C0mun1s7>	I Know EXACTLY when it will be released!! I am just not telling (other wise what fun is being omnipotent)
[none]	[06:25]	<crimsun>	khermans: the timestamps from publisher mean nothing until the released is announced.
[none]	[06:25]	<nhaines>	nbx909, yes.
[positive]	[06:25]	<zcat[1] >	JabberWokky: east coast are a little lagged at the moment I guess :)

[none]	[06:25]	<Bilford>	Mark Shuttleworth went to the INternational Space Station
[none]	[06:25]	<nbx909>	nhaines, okay then my bad
[none]	[06:25]	<Flannel>	Vaske_Car: security updates, right.  You can still use it, and still upgrade it to a later version.
[none]	[06:26]	<rredd4>	intelikey oops...
[none]	[06:26]	<nbx909>	nhaines, i guess we will see when the stable verson is released if i was right
[none]	[06:26]	<rredd4>	lol
[positive]	[06:26]	<intelikey>	:)
[none]	[06:26]	<khermans>	crimsun, is there a HOWTO on the release process?  Do they say what special testing is done to the final ISOs and things like this?
[none]	[06:26]	<Meshezabeel>	Dapper will be released on at 06:06:06am
[positive]	[06:26]	<nhaines>	nbx909, the release candidate one week ago was an attempt to make a gold copy of 6.06, so, we have to wait until the announcemtn.  :)
[none]	[06:26]	<khermans>	to ensure like not major flaws in the release, like a bad image
[none]	[06:26]	<Bilford>	why is everyone waiting?  the final release wont be much different than the latest build
[positive]	[06:27]	<KurtKraut>	TiG4, fantastic :P
[none]	[06:27]	<grv>	because it will be *official*
[none]	[06:27]	<Bilford>	you might have to download 2 mb of updates
[none]	[06:27]	<khermans>	Meshezabeel, that would be sweet 666
[positive]	[06:27]	<ajax4>	Bilford: This will be my first time running Ubuntu, so I figured I'd wait for the final release.
[none]	[06:27]	<T313C0mun1s7>	Ok, Ok - it will be sometime after the thousands of hungry mirrors are done syncing, or just after you give up and go to bed (which ever comes last)
[none]	[06:27]	<Meshezabeel>	khermans, oh no, the end has come!!!
[none]	[06:27]	<jtd>	hi, guys!
[none]	[06:27]	<intelikey>	rredd4 you may catch me doing that a lot.  i generally lag several seconds do to using all my band-narrowness
[positive]	[06:27]	<Flannel>	Bilford: most of us want to start serving up torrents, to share the wealth.  I know I'm not downloading to install, just to mirrow.
[positive]	[06:27]	<Soir>	Bilford: ISOs, maybe?
[none]	[06:27]	<zcat[1] >	khermans: I think they should have delayed five more days, just for the coolness factor of releasing at 06:06:06 06/06/06
[positive]	[06:27]	<bimberi>	Bilford: shhhh, you're spoiling their fun :P
[none]	[06:27]	<jtd>	can someone give me a brief rundown on how well the x86-64 version of Ubuntu works at the moment?
[none]	[06:27]	<nhaines>	Bilford, for example, the kids' computer is not connected to the Internet, so I am waiting for a final CD to burn to take over and do updates.
[none]	[06:27]	<Bilford>	ok sorry
[positive]	[06:27]	<jtd>	"(if the answer is ""poorly,"" say no more ;)"
[none]	[06:28]	<rredd4>	intelikey i see, i have a .1s lag
[none]	[06:28]	<rredd4>	cable
[positive]	[06:28]	<paradon>	jtd: Not very, if you want stuff like Java, Flash, and windows media codecs.
[positive]	[06:28]	<windex>	Bilford: this hardware has never run linux nativley.. i'd rather use something as polished as possible/
[none]	[06:28]	<khermans>	zcat[1] , anything is still possible!
[none]	[06:28]	<jtd>	paradon: good to know.  Thanks.
[positive]	[06:28]	<zcat[1] >	nah, no more unexpected delays.. it's not vista!!
[none]	[06:28]	<rredd4>	intelikey would a different server help...
[none]	[06:28]	<Bilford>	windex, you like things clean and shiny
[none]	[06:28]	<intelikey>	rredd4 i can't speek of 'band-width' on a 28k modem.
[positive]	[06:28]	<Viaken>	jtd: But you can run those things in a chroot, with varying degrees of success.
[none]	[06:28]	<khermans>	Vista looks pretty cool -- too bad it sucks
[none]	[06:28]	<intelikey>	rredd4 it's band narrowness
[none]	[06:28]	<T313C0mun1s7>	JTD unless you need TONS of memory access - stick with 32 bit, there are too many things still not supported
[positive]	[06:28]	<intelikey>	:)
[none]	[06:29]	<rredd4>	intelikey  ok, 28k eye eye...
[none]	[06:29]	<bkh>	From what I've seen, Vista has nothing over XGL.

[none]	[06:29]	<jtd>	I just sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade'd when the last time I did it was a few days ago, and only 4 packages were updated.  they must be doing well.
[none]	[06:29]	<khermans>	bkh, yeah XGL rocks man, i love it
[none]	[06:29]	<jtd>	Viaken: what do you mean by running things in a chroot?

[none]	[06:30]	<bkh>	XGL is a new system that renders your whole desktop through OpenGL, so you can do all sorts of crazy things
[none]	[06:30]	<rredd4>	intelikey  how do you upgrade to dapper then, friends?  cd?
[none]	[06:30]	<T313C0mun1s7>	JTD only if the binary is native 64bit and VERY FEW are. Even then it is minimal

[none]	[06:33]	<onkarshinde>	no0ke: sometime today

[none]	[06:48]	<eigenlambda>	kinda funny...
[none]	[06:48]	<Xore>	;_;
[none]	[06:48]	<eigenlambda>	i guess the Matrix isn't invertible, then
[none]	[06:48]	<jtd>	h3h_timo: it means that, for example, if the boot sequence is waiting on an IP address from DHCP, nothing else happens while it's waiting.  the system just sits there and waits.
[none]	[06:48]	<eigenlambda>	if one of the eigenvalues is 0

[positive]	[06:59]	<Soir>	nbx909: try upgrading from 4.10 in stages and then installing xubuntu-desktop ;)
[negative]	[06:59]	<Saj>	but thats a dream for now:(

[none]	[06:59]	<JoseStefan>	"the ubuntuforums has ""unconfirmed"" links"

[none]	[07:00]	<troy_s>	jrsims:  what version of ubuntu you running?
[none]	[07:00]	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: Give it a little time.

[none]	[07:00]	<DarkTower>	how stable will doing an upgrade from breezy be when dapper is released?
[none]	[07:00]	<troy_s>	rob138:  i THINK there are torrent listings at cdimage.ubuntu.com
[none]	[07:00]	<jrsims>	troy_s: most current dapper
[none]	[07:00]	<troy_s>	whoops
[none]	[07:00]	<DShepherd>	DaSkreech: what?
[none]	[07:00]	<troy_s>	cdimages.ubuntu.com
[none]	[07:00]	<rob_p>	troy_s:  Yup!
[none]	[07:00]	<intelikey>	you can script that.  i wrote it.  it's GNU
[none]	[07:00]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	now is working
[none]	[07:00]	<JoseStefan>	there is a rumor that the current dailys = final
[none]	[07:00]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	before it didn't request me the password and nothing
[none]	[07:01]	<rob138>	troy_s thanks
[none]	[07:01]	<jrsims>	troy_s: nm, looked at synaptic. I have 7
[positive]	[07:01]	<rob_p>	troy_s:  Oops!  Wrong rob :-)
[none]	[07:01]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	so... when It finish, I'll have dapper then?
[none]	[07:01]	<grndslm>	does anybody know how to use flash memory as part of system memory, like vista does?  i gotta admit, that's pretty amazing that microsoft came up with a measly one new feature to the software industry
[none]	[07:01]	<troy_s>	guys, ubuntu is where it is at.  i believe mark has a few tricks up his sleeve regarding sun... we shall need to wait and see.
[none]	[07:01]	<bimberi>	JoseStefan: that's pretty likely
[none]	[07:01]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
[none]	[07:01]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	 is this ok?
[none]	[07:01]	<troy_s>	the open sourcing of java soon and mark's response from the sun crowd was enough to suggest some back room chitters.
[none]	[07:01]	<eigenlambda>	No.  Using flash as system memory is stupid.
[none]	[07:01]	<jrsims>	so whats the news with Sun and ubuntu? Sun going to support it or what?
[none]	[07:02]	<eigenlambda>	it *will* destroy your flash
[none]	[07:02]	<grndslm>	eigenlambda, why?
[none]	[07:02]	<eigenlambda>	flash can only be rewritten a certain number of times.
[none]	[07:02]	<DarkTower>	grndslm: how much would that gain you? where does it say vista is doing that?
[none]	[07:02]	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: It should be. I get that error sometimes, too.
[positive]	[07:02]	<troy_s>	jrsims:  depends on how you read it.  if sun wants to jettison the whole os aspect and focus on pure corp, it is an interesting situation... :)
[none]	[07:02]	<DarkTower>	wsouldnt make sense to use flash memory like that
[positive]	[07:02]	<JoseStefan>	i rather have a ramdrive composed of DDR, but that's expensive
[none]	[07:02]	<grndslm>	DarkTower, i don't recall the site, but look it up if you'd like
[none]	[07:02]	<bkh>	It's an awful lot of writes, but swap gets re-written constantly
[none]	[07:02]	<Viaken>	GianLuigiBuffon: That said, proceed at your own risk. Ctrl-C if you want to stop it.
[none]	[07:02]	<eigenlambda>	using it like it's disk space is commonplace, because that's what it is like
[none]	[07:02]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	viaken  now appeared for update... with a large list of stuff that wont be installed
[none]	[07:02]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	no, it's done
[none]	[07:02]	<eigenlambda>	using it as main memory is stupid beyond belief
[none]	[07:02]	<chuck>	How do I setup Xserver to use system RAM as video RAM?
[none]	[07:03]	<Merturk_NB|hw>	well, this weekend I'm opening up a Tattoo Parlor running almost pure Ubuntu 6.06
[none]	[07:03]	<jrsims>	troy_s: think that's what they want to do? Make ubuntu their flagship OS?
[none]	[07:03]	<OmniD>	grndslm: for some reason that sounds like a really stupid idea considering the amount of writes are limited before the flash memory is useless
[none]	[07:03]	<Joetheodd>	Happy Dapper day! It's now 12:03AM CST!
[none]	[07:03]	<grndslm>	eigenlambda, there is no flash that can be written to like ram?
[none]	[07:03]	<Merturk_NB|hw>	minus one manager (my father) that is staying on Windows
[none]	[07:03]	<vinboy>	happy dapper day
[none]	[07:03]	<DarkTower>	grndslm: sorry but as you can see from peoples responses that doesnt make sense, may have read wrong or the site was bs
[none]	[07:03]	<troy_s>	jrsims:  I don't know.  But one would think that having Mark on stage has something to do with something.
[none]	[07:03]	<eigenlambda>	grndslm: it can be written to like ram...
[none]	[07:03]	<Merturk_NB|hw>	he just hard a heart attack, so I don't want to stress him out
[none]	[07:03]	<eigenlambda>	...but that's a dumb idea
[negative]	[07:03]	<grv>	idk why they gotta be secretive on the release:/
[positive]	[07:03]	<jet87>	Joetheodd: CDT, you mean?
[none]	[07:03]	<Xaero_Vincent>	why would u need Ubuntu in a Tatto Parlor?
[none]	[07:03]	<grndslm>	i'll take your guys' word for it....
[none]	[07:03]	<eigenlambda>	of course it's random access

[none]	[07:05]	<DarkTower>	troy_s: i like amd much better, but how is intel closed?? I find whenever i want something to work with ubuntu i use original intel and all is fine
[none]	[07:05]	<grv>	core duo is very good too

[none]	[07:06]	<DarkTower>	troy_s: sorry thats not much of an argument, And saying amd supports open source doesnt mean intel is closed, one doesnt follow from the other. As i said i like amd better, but unless you can give an example of how closed intel is that doesnt make sense

[none]	[07:07]	<spartas>	joetheodd, not trying to be politically correct; there is a difference (CDT is UTC-5, CST is UTC-6)
[none]	[07:07]	<Efnian>	vinboy, all amd's are 64-bit nowadays.
[none]	[07:07]	<troy_s>	darktower:  that's all i will say.

[none]	[07:07]	<intelikey>	JoseStefan yeah
[none]	[07:07]	<bkh>	I fried a scsi cable that way once...
[none]	[07:07]	<DarkTower>	troy_s: lol sorry. if you actual knew something you'd give a reason. Its like if i yelled out the sky is red, do your research thats why. You would have an example
[none]	[07:07]	<jet87>	i hear enough about time zones living in indiana, they're a touchy subject for me
[none]	[07:08]	<maruchan>	but i cant cuase it says it wants to change  diffrent file and its not allowed
[none]	[07:08]	<jbroome>	purple is better than brown
[none]	[07:08]	<Efnian>	I keep a safe distance to all time zones.
[none]	[07:08]	<grndslm>	jet87, i don't have a core duo, but intel is extremely open and smp support has worked with linux forever....apparently linux runs quicker than os x on the macbooks
[none]	[07:08]	<crimsun>	jbroome: omg ponies.

[none]	[07:09]	<bkh>	It was a misguided attempt at making a scsi drive visible by two different computers at the same time back in college...
[none]	[07:09]	<jet87>	the core duos support VT, and googling around vmware can run as a hypervisor (like xen).  i would flat out install ubuntu if i didn't have to worry about dell hell and not fubaring the rest of the special partitions
[none]	[07:09]	<nbx909>	JoseStefan, anything but this stupid brown-orange color
[none]	[07:09]	<Saj>	vinboy: you see the the chip actualy works 32bit, every single part of it, but every bufer has 32 bits extra and if there is something above 32 bits that particuler buffer thingi switches to 64bit....so its basicly two things in one..the amd core is clocked slower, this is better because it makes less heat and thus is more overclockable, the other advantage is the memory controller which is on the chip, this optimises the ram and thus makes the system mroe e
[none]	[07:09]	<Saj>	fficient and faster.
[none]	[07:09]	<DarkTower>	troy_s: ok do your homework
[none]	[07:10]	<nbx909>	i have to install bluecurve every time

[none]	[07:14]	<troy_s>	grv:  i think it ultimately depends on what chip is driving it.
[none]	[07:14]	<wims>	do you think ndiswrapper will work after a dist upgrade?
[none]	[07:14]	<troy_s>	grv:  and if the idiots would just open there specs, we wouldn't be having this discussion.

[none]	[07:28]	<Hentai_Jeff>	rendo:for a linux distro it's alot
[none]	[07:28]	<ray__>	i'm obviously new to this

[none]	[07:29]	<sklav>	eth0 is not found but its found under the name eth3
[none]	[07:29]	<nomin>	Saj, I don't know too many of the technical aspects of it, but it says on the website that it is based on linux's ability to recognize a joystick.
[positive]	[07:29]	<rendo>	I'll do my part in the next few years, I plan to startup a computer shop in my area and I plan to expand to the entire northern region of the province, will offer PC's either barebone or with Ubuntu. ;)  No windows. :b
[none]	[07:30]	<JoseStefan>	ubuntube: you might need to mess with your init scripts, the wiki may have something on that
[none]	[07:30]	<Viaken>	axion`: Meanwhile your other hand is rewriting the kernel and writing shell scripts that feed your cat?
[positive]	[07:30]	<rendo>	Saj: Master and Slave. :b
[none]	[07:30]	<troy_s>	kingghost:  if you add the rar support, the default archiver should handle rar.

[none]	[07:30]	<nomin>	Saj, I would like to get more people interested in it so that it's made for more distros and so that the minor things can be fixed.  I think it's the only program necessary for using the joystick or gamepad on linux.
[none]	[07:30]	<sklav>	troy_s, no they are not
[none]	[07:30]	<lwarimav>	intelikey: I use Ubuntu

[none]	[07:31]	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff: Thanks, I really have a huge dislike for Windows and there's no need paying $100 to make a machine for people.
[none]	[07:31]	<rpaul>	Is there anywork being done to make the upgrade done through ubuntu torrent based.  That would surely reduce the server load for those dist-upgrading
[none]	[07:31]	<troy_s>	sklav:  well i will say that it is fixable for certain.  sounds like a skript borked you a bit.
[none]	[07:31]	<JoseStefan>	"ray__: in case ""something"" messed it up, it should be good as new again"

[none]	[07:32]	<ray__>	troy_s, what should i be looking for in the Xorg.0.log?
[none]	[07:32]	<kbrosnan>	lwarimav, before going through the add a user step there are a number of firefox trouble shooting steps, the first being to start firefox's safe mode
[none]	[07:32]	<troy_s>	sklav:  are they active etc?
[none]	[07:32]	<ray__>	josestefan, how do you reset it?
[none]	[07:32]	<sklav>	something todo with how the kernel loaded the module and associated alias

[none]	[07:32]	<nomin>	Saj, well if you see more people that want to play games or have mouse and keyboard emulation with the joystick, just tell them about qjoypad.  Do you agree that it's a very useful program?
[positive]	[07:32]	<DarkTower>	Hentai_Jeff: with ubuntu preinstalled :)
[none]	[07:32]	<troy_s>	maruchan:  yay
[none]	[07:33]	<intelikey>	lwarimav remote desktop ?
[none]	[07:33]	<axion`>	that's because blizzard is king of flawless execution
[none]	[07:33]	<Hentai_Jeff>	so ppl that want that kick ass looking and running PC but haven't the time to do it can still get it
[none]	[07:33]	<sklav>	what is the equivalent of modprobe.conf on ubuntu?
[none]	[07:33]	<Viaken>	You know...I was thinking. Couldn't someone make a package manager that used torrents instead of fetching the files normally? Or, at least, the larger files?
[none]	[07:33]	<troy_s>	maruchan:  now spread the ubuntu.
[none]	[07:33]	<Hentai_Jeff>	and ubuntu would be an option yes
[none]	[07:33]	<JoseStefan>	ray__: remember, to make a copy first. let me look for it

[none]	[07:33]	<majd>	can you create restore points in ubuntu?
[positive]	[07:33]	<troy_s>	joetheodd:  use ssh

[positive]	[07:33]	<troy_s>	joetheodd:  everything else is ugly insecure.

[none]	[07:35]	<Hentai_Jeff>	Dell thought about it

[none]	[07:39]	<CHodapp>	It's certainly been getting a lot of publicity for being apparently a lot more easier than Windows to install and set up
[none]	[07:39]	<eigenlambda>	trolls like to go wherever the people are
[none]	[07:39]	<Viaken>	CHodapp: No matter what it is, you'll always find someone who hates it.
[none]	[07:39]	<fiendskull9>	doesnt dapper come out today? (tommorow, whatever you wanna say)
[none]	[07:39]	<eigenlambda>	of course
[none]	[07:40]	<Hentai_Jeff>	Chodapp:it has?
[none]	[07:40]	<grv>	!dapper
[none]	[07:40]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
[none]	[07:40]	<eigenlambda>	to remind them that cthulhu is coming
[negative]	[07:40]	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, yes. It shows as http://yourhost.yourdomain/~youraccount/ when using a browser
[none]	[07:40]	<jtd>	fiendskull9: should do, yes.
[none]	[07:40]	<paradon>	thug: nbx909 gave you the latest daily build, which some people here think will be identical to the same release.
[none]	[07:40]	<fiendskull9>	yayaya
[none]	[07:40]	<fiendskull9>	i cant wait
[none]	[07:40]	<troy_s>	ray:  ok well then you are def on the driver...
[none]	[07:40]	<Hentai_Jeff>	most ppl don't even see windows geting installed
[none]	[07:40]	<CHodapp>	Hentai_Jeff, relative to other distros, at least.
[none]	[07:40]	<mikedep333>	can anyone tell me how to check what runs on what runlevels in dapper?
[none]	[07:40]	<majd>	i've seen that message 15 times in the last 2 minutes lol
[none]	[07:40]	<ray__>	josestefan, i'm currently having no problems on my desktop, i just can't get svideo out to work on TV
[none]	[07:40]	<CHodapp>	Hentai_Jeff, nope, they don't.
[positive]	[07:40]	<jtd>	I should have had a Dapper release party :)
[none]	[07:40]	<troy_s>	ray:  do a little hunting under dual head mode.  twinview is some driver mod by nvidia.
[none]	[07:40]	<Hentai_Jeff>	so they don't really know
[none]	[07:40]	<fiendskull9>	probably around 8-9 am CST?
[none]	[07:40]	<lwarimav>	kbrosnan:my computer is connected to a network centralised to a server that registered all profile usine this computer... So my firefox doen't work.... Now my question is should i solve it localy on the PC, or I have to edit my profile on the server?????
[none]	[07:40]	<troy_s>	ray:  dual head mode is the more x-windows pure way of doing that sort of thing.
[none]	[07:40]	<rendo>	I wonder how pissed my wife would be if she woke up to Ubuntu as her OS.....
[none]	[07:40]	<DarkTower>	will the official ubuntu book be coming out in print??
[none]	[07:40]	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : no I dont want ~ , I just want it to be on root
[none]	[07:40]	<spikeb>	heh
[negative]	[07:40]	<JoseStefan>	ray__: oh, i thought you had X starting problems :S
[none]	[07:41]	<grv>	rendo, how good is she with comps?
[positive]	[07:41]	<Zambini>	Hey, someone wanna help me with vnc and an ubuntu>XP connection? pm me
[positive]	[07:41]	<jtd>	rendo: back it up first, then upgrade her to Ubuntu :)
[none]	[07:41]	<spikeb>	my wife thought it was cool when she'd wake up without windows on her pc
[none]	[07:41]	<spikeb>	long as it booted
[none]	[07:41]	<ray__>	sorry, josestefan. i should have specified
[none]	[07:41]	<grv>	is there anything she does that she cant possibly do on nix
[positive]	[07:41]	<rendo>	grv: She's an idiot. :P
[none]	[07:41]	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubese, oh. The root apache directory is /var/www something
[none]	[07:41]	<fiendskull9>	rendo, ive considered installing slackware 2.3 without a gui on one of my enemys computers
[none]	[07:41]	<grv>	exactly
[none]	[07:41]	<Saj>	rendo: lol hahaha, what she using atm?
[none]	[07:41]	<nomin>	Saj: have you tried cedega yet?
[positive]	[07:41]	<rendo>	saj: XP. :/
[none]	[07:41]	<JoseStefan>	ray__: maybe i missed something, it is pretty cluttered in here :o
[none]	[07:41]	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, is this person a PC lover?
[none]	[07:41]	<DarkTower>	rendo: my gf loves it. hates windows now. AFter she saw how much more quickly devices like camera and ipod worked, out with windows
[none]	[07:41]	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, no, one of those, IE and AIM on the desktop type of people
[none]	[07:41]	<jtd>	fiendskull9: doesn't Slack have a reasonably easy to use package manager that would let them install a gui pretty fast?
[none]	[07:41]	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : oo so meaning that I have to paste it into www right?
[none]	[07:41]	<ray__>	troy_s, so do you know much about dual head mode?
[none]	[07:41]	<rendo>	DarkTower: Well she bugs me all the time about the stupidest things.
[none]	[07:42]	<VR_>	i wish wireless would work better.
[none]	[07:42]	<intelikey>	lwarimav looks like you are going to need some advanced help there.  myself being network illiterate, i'm not sure if you are talking about a remote desktop from a terminal server or just a lan config.  so i will have to defer you to more qualified help.    crimson maybe ?
[positive]	[07:42]	<fiendskull9>	jtd, we are talking 2.3, like 1996 here :P
[none]	[07:42]	<Saj>	nomin: no, just been on wine for the last few days...is cedega easier to operate then wine, i mean is it reali as simple as rag and drop?
[positive]	[07:42]	<zcat[1] >	http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/.pool/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso  -- is this it? :-)
[positive]	[07:42]	<jtd>	fiendskull9: hahahahaha :D
[none]	[07:42]	<ray__>	josestefan, it's very cluttered in here!
[none]	[07:42]	<DarkTower>	rendo: lol shes your wife, thats her job
[positive]	[07:42]	<troy_s>	ray:  done a couple times.  it should seem easy compared to twinview :)
[positive]	[07:42]	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes: umm, no. The /var/www/ is visible by default. Just put content in there :)
[none]	[07:42]	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, I have a floppy disk that makes a ramdisk and runs MacOS 6 or something on it in 512x384... all monochrome
[none]	[07:42]	<rendo>	"DarkTower: Like ""I downloaded this torrent for <TYCOON GAME HERE> and it's a .dmg file, how do I make it so it works on windows"""
[none]	[07:42]	<fiendskull9>	jtd, but i beleive they even used slapt back then, but the repositories would be weird
[negative]	[07:42]	<Unenvarjo>	it shows as http://yourhost.yourdomain/
[none]	[07:42]	<kbrosnan>	"lwarimav, none of that should matter just ""firefox -safe-mode"" in a console window"
[positive]	[07:42]	<Saj>	rendo: install a theme that looks like xp lol hahaha confuse her;)
[none]	[07:42]	<rendo>	So I come here, and ask since I'm tired as shit and I don't know macs at all.
[none]	[07:42]	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, lmao
[none]	[07:42]	<DarkTower>	rendo: heheh
[positive]	[07:42]	<jtd>	"fiendskull9: and by ""weird"" we mean ""not there"" :)"
[none]	[07:42]	<fiendskull9>	Saj, they have those, they are pretty nice
[positive]	[07:42]	<rendo>	Learn it's for macs and won't work on windows. :P
[none]	[07:42]	<eigenlambda>	you mean system 6
[none]	[07:42]	<fiendskull9>	jtd, lol
[none]	[07:42]	<PPower>	_nano_: Hello again! I have finally fixed it!!!
[none]	[07:42]	<ray__>	troy_s, any good places to learn how to accomplish dual head?
[none]	[07:42]	<Viaken>	I'd love to get my g/f running Linux of any type, but she's so attached to MSN's piddly lil features that the open source IM clients haven't caught up with (or avoid for good reason)...
[none]	[07:42]	<rendo>	So I beat her.
[none]	[07:42]	<threat>	is it released yet?
[none]	[07:42]	<CHodapp>	eigenlambda, yes, I probably do.
[negative]	[07:42]	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, and any directory under /var/www/ shows as http://yourhost.blahblah/mydir/
[none]	[07:42]	<eigenlambda>	"it wasn't called ""mac os"" until 7.6"
[none]	[07:43]	<eigenlambda>	hehe
[none]	[07:43]	<JoseStefan>	rendo: try daemon tools for windows
[none]	[07:43]	<eigenlambda>	jinxt
[none]	[07:43]	<troy_s>	ray:  start with the wiki, then the forums.  i am pretty sure you will hit success shortly.
[none]	[07:43]	<jtd>	yeah
[none]	[07:43]	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : oo i got it... thanks
[none]	[07:43]	<jtd>	"it was ""System 7.5"""
[none]	[07:43]	<CHodapp>	eigenlambda, uses VMac... pretty handy because it's light.
[none]	[07:43]	<Unenvarjo>	np
[none]	[07:43]	<fiendskull9>	Viaken, kopete has some nice little piddley features
[none]	[07:43]	<rendo>	JoseStefan: Doesn't work with .dmg files, unless there's a newer version that supports it.
[none]	[07:43]	<lwarimav>	intelikey: Its a lan config
[none]	[07:43]	<_nano_>	PPower: congrats! \o./
[none]	[07:43]	<Hentai_Jeff>	rendo:your wife prefers macs?
[none]	[07:43]	<axion`>	maybe PowerISO?
[none]	[07:43]	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, check if I'm right though, I have a terrible memory and I almost never use the apache root directory
[none]	[07:43]	<troy_s>	ray:  off to beddy.  good luck.  and if you don't hit it, just come back.  this place has plenty of knowledgable folks
[positive]	[07:43]	<Viaken>	fiendskull9: I'll look into it. :P
[none]	[07:43]	<rendo>	Hentai_Jeff: No, she downloaded a .dmg file and tried to get it to work on a PC machine.
[none]	[07:43]	<jtd>	especially 10.4
[none]	[07:43]	<fiendskull9>	My schools computers run OSX tiger, and i primarily use the terminal for everything
[none]	[07:44]	<ray__>	thanks for the help, troy_s
[none]	[07:44]	<Hentai_Jeff>	hmm
[positive]	[07:44]	<fiendskull9>	dont need no fancy aqua gui :P
[none]	[07:44]	<rendo>	PowerISO converted it, but wouldn't emulate it.
[none]	[07:44]	<CHodapp>	My school computers are mostly Windows
[positive]	[07:44]	<_nano_>	PPower: so how did you solve it? i'm really curious :D
[none]	[07:44]	<nomin>	Saj:  wine is a pain in the ass.  Cedega is much easier than wine.  Cedega is built on wine.  I tried the cedega demo and it works beautifully.  It even installs the updates.  It's awesome.  Only problem I found is that you can't play on punkbuster enabled servers because it doesn't like non-windows computers.
[none]	[07:44]	<PPower>	_nano_: There is still one issue to iron out though. Every time I reboot I have to run iwconfig eth1 ap any and then disable and then reenable the adapter to get any signal
[none]	[07:44]	<jtd>	Aqua *is* pretty, though
[none]	[07:44]	<intelikey>	lwarimav then ignore all other computers and work on the one firefox is on.    all my questions will be addressing that particular box.
[none]	[07:44]	<Hentai_Jeff>	the logic of that escapes me
[none]	[07:44]	<PPower>	_nano_: Wired it up and installed the fwcutter package, then run the ubuntu script
[none]	[07:44]	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : hehe...
[none]	[07:44]	<CHodapp>	nomin, that's weird, Enemy Territory uses punkbuster and I'm on Linux
[none]	[07:44]	<fiendskull9>	jtd, yes very, the apple GD's hit a big note when osx came out. a BIG note
[none]	[07:44]	<nomin>	cedega is very easy to use
[none]	[07:44]	<_nano_>	PPower: aah nice..so now you are using the bcm43xx driver then
[none]	[07:44]	<Hentai_Jeff>	it's like that damn boot camp
[none]	[07:44]	<intelikey>	lwarimav do you have more than one user account on that box ?
[none]	[07:44]	<CHodapp>	The interface on OS X is nice but it's not anything particularly special to me
[none]	[07:44]	<RancidLM>	any rumors on what time 6.06 is being released?
[negative]	[07:44]	<grv>	does cedega really not work on pb:(?
[none]	[07:44]	<PPower>	_nano_: yes, did you get that thing about the reboot though?
[none]	[07:45]	<grv>	!dapper
[none]	[07:45]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 24 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
[none]	[07:45]	<_nano_>	PPower: pm?
[none]	[07:45]	<lwarimav>	intelikey: yes
[none]	[07:45]	<fiendskull9>	jtd, it would be a godsend if they released all the gui source, and graphics for it. it would be very portable
[none]	[07:45]	<ubuntubes>	Does anybody know how to limit the bandwidth for individual workstation??
[none]	[07:45]	<Saj>	nomin: yeh it was called wine x before....how do you get the demo mate?
[none]	[07:45]	<PPower>	_nano_: ??? i dont get you
[none]	[07:45]	<gambit>	in dpkg-reconfigure locales how do i select en_us, it wont check the box
[none]	[07:45]	<lwarimav>	intelikey: I have more than 100 users
[none]	[07:45]	<intelikey>	lwarimav does firefox work for other users ?
[none]	[07:45]	<nomin>	Chodapp, maybe punkbuster allows linux now.  I tried it a few months ago, guess I'll have to try it again.  it was an issue in the cedega forums, cedega said they were'nt able to play on punkbuster at that time.
[none]	[07:45]	<Hentai_Jeff>	what is the point of booting winblows on a mac?
[none]	[07:45]	<sklav>	how can one grep inside a bunch of files for a particular word?
[none]	[07:45]	<rendo>	Games.
[none]	[07:45]	<jtd>	fiendskull9: I'm waiting for the day they reimplement Cocoa, Aqua, Carbon, and the rest of the OS on top of L4 instead of something Mach-y.  ::drool::
[none]	[07:45]	<sklav>	example /etc
[none]	[07:45]	<nomin>	Saj, it's on cedegas site.
[none]	[07:45]	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, well, its just like using linux (unless your a PandC type of guy)
[none]	[07:45]	<Unenvarjo>	ubuntubes, a program called wondershaper can do that
[none]	[07:45]	<lwarimav>	intelikey: yes but exept me
[none]	[07:45]	<eigenlambda>	what't the point of getting a mac in thefirst place?
[none]	[07:45]	<CHodapp>	nomin, eh... it's been in ET for at least a year now, that's when I got it - could be longer, even
[none]	[07:45]	<rendo>	Haha.
[positive]	[07:45]	<Saj>	btw guys of the community, gals of the community, dev team, eery one....ubuntu rox:D
[none]	[07:46]	<grv>	hentai_jeff, i know someone whos parents bought him a mac for college so he wouldnt game
[none]	[07:46]	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, uh.... how?
[none]	[07:46]	<fiendskull9>	agreed
[none]	[07:46]	<Saj>	thnx for ubuntu
[none]	[07:46]	<rendo>	grv: LOL
[none]	[07:46]	<sklav>	anybody?
[none]	[07:46]	<rendo>	grv: That's awesome. :B
[none]	[07:46]	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, darwin was written from unix source
[none]	[07:46]	<Hentai_Jeff>	ok there's the only good point I've seen for that
[none]	[07:46]	<grv>	but he kept his grades up and he eventually took his comp with him after the first semister
[none]	[07:46]	<sklav>	how can one grep inside a bunch of files for a particular word? example eth3 in /etc/*
[none]	[07:46]	<intelikey>	lwarimav ok then it is a local issue.  i.e. the probolem exists within your /home/<your_name>/ dir
[none]	[07:46]	<grv>	lol
[none]	[07:46]	<ubuntubes>	Unenvarjo : ok i give a try
[none]	[07:46]	<eigenlambda>	What's the deal with you mac fanatics? ...I don't see why anybody would choose a Mac over other faster, cheaper, more stable systems.
[none]	[07:46]	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, i think 95% of OSX commands are unix commands
[none]	[07:46]	<Viaken>	Unenvarjo: Should I be bothered that it hasn't been updated in 4 years?
[none]	[07:46]	<msikma>	When will the site's /download page be updated?
[none]	[07:46]	<troy_s>	sklav:  man grep
[none]	[07:46]	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, that's great, but people usually only see the GUI.
[positive]	[07:46]	<Saj>	nomin: thnx, ii thought its one of them tight one:D:D:D....he he he

[none]	[07:46]	<rendo>	Windows is garbage, MAC's are like pre-garbage moldy cabbage, and Ubuntu is my wife's canoloni's

[none]	[07:46]	<Viaken>	msikma: When Dapper is officially released.
[none]	[07:46]	<msikma>	eigenlambda: tsk. Starting zealous discussions again?

[none]	[07:47]	<nomin>	CHodapp, maybe some games can play on PB and some can't.  I don't know.
[none]	[07:47]	<msikma>	This is why I hate this channel.
[none]	[07:47]	<jtd>	eigenlambda: are you talking about hardware?  other than the thermal paste debacle, Macs are very, very well-designed machines.
[none]	[07:47]	<nosklo>	i want final dapper, where is it, where is it, where is it
[none]	[07:47]	<CHodapp>	fiendskull9, if you go to the prompt, then maybe it's like using Linux.
[none]	[07:47]	<sklav>	thanks spartas
[none]	[07:47]	<fiendskull9>	CHodapp, i do enjoy chatting with _real_ mac geeks though, because they appreciate the core
[positive]	[07:47]	<Unenvarjo>	viaken, I haven't been. That just means it sta(b)le :P
[none]	[07:47]	<axion`>	they should make Ubuntu commercials featuring the 'Mac Guy' and the 'PC Guy'

[negative]	[08:30]	<khermans>	wget http://kristianhermansen.com/tmp/DapperOut && perl DapperOut
[none]	[08:30]	<robinl1>	Guys..
[none]	[08:30]	<l_r>	how much do we have to wait?
[none]	[08:30]	<robinl1>	Dapper is already...
[none]	[08:30]	<JoseStefan>	jrsims, a friend of mine has it
[none]	[08:30]	<Fujitsu>	!dapper
[none]	[08:30]	<Hodapp>	Oh calm down...

[none]	[08:30]	<robinl1>	Released
[none]	[08:30]	<robinl1>	but not officialy
[none]	[08:30]	<jameswang>	"How can shield the ""join/quit"" message?"
[positive]	[08:30]	<robinl1>	xD
[none]	[08:30]	<Touru>	It's possible to update via normal updater, isn't it? But, is it better to do a fresh install?
[none]	[08:30]	<cef>	swarmz: might end up as the final release, but there is no official word on wether it will be. till there's official word, it can't technically be the release
[none]	[08:30]	<l_r>	lastnode,  i read it 24.01 hours ago
[none]	[08:30]	<herbheart>	l_r til June 1, midday
[none]	[08:30]	<robinl1>	I have the  new dapper right here now.
[none]	[08:30]	<l_r>	it's obsolete
[none]	[08:30]	<jrsims>	JoseStefan: well, maybe you can answer this. I've installed xgl and compiz (and supporting packages). But how do I start it?
[none]	[08:30]	<lastnode>	Touru, apt-get dist-upgrade works fine
[none]	[08:31]	<robinl1>	it's from yesterday
[none]	[08:31]	<swarmz>	i wanted an excuse to not do anything at work today!
[none]	[08:31]	<lastnode>	l_r, well, it still stands
[none]	[08:31]	<swarmz>	damn it!
[none]	[08:31]	<Hodapp>	Seveas, sheesh, it was a joke...
[none]	[08:31]	<Graig>	i have a problem with the screensaver applet, i think it's a bug..  it will start up during a game like tremulous.
[none]	[08:31]	<Hodapp>	swarmz, would that excuse really work?
[positive]	[08:31]	<Touru>	lastnode: Excellent, thanks. =)
[none]	[08:31]	<lastnode>	Hobart, #ubuntu-offtopic is fine for stuff like that
[none]	[08:31]	<lastnode>	sorry
[none]	[08:31]	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: there is a way to load compiz using a .xsession file in your home dir
[none]	[08:31]	<lastnode>	Hodapp, that was for you
[none]	[08:31]	<swarmz>	will 6.06 include support for gnome, kde and others?
[none]	[08:31]	<eobanb>	swarmz, ....????
[none]	[08:31]	<Seveas>	swarmz, no, just blackbox
[none]	[08:31]	<swarmz>	or will they be separate isos?
[none]	[08:31]	<jameswang>	"How can shield the ""join/quit"" message?"
[none]	[08:31]	<jameswang>	"How can shield the ""join/quit"" message?"
[none]	[08:32]	<jameswang>	"How can shield the ""join/quit"" message?"
[none]	[08:32]	<l_r>	swarmz, no, they have removed everything ..
[none]	[08:32]	<eobanb>	!patience
[none]	[08:32]	<robinl1>	Is it forbidden to grab the final iso (which is there) from the ubuntu server, meant for the mirrors?
[none]	[08:32]	<ubotu>	The people in this channel are volunteers. Please be aware there are a lot of questions, but only maybe few who might know the answer for you. Please be patient. Your attitude may determine their willingness to help you.
[none]	[08:32]	<Madpilot>	swarmz: they've always been seperate ISOs
[none]	[08:32]	<Hodapp>	Wait, ask one more time, jameswang
[none]	[08:32]	<JoseStefan>	jameswang: depends on your client
[none]	[08:32]	<robinl1>	The people in #ubuntu+1 did
[none]	[08:32]	<eobanb>	jameswang, it's a client-side setting
[none]	[08:32]	<robinl1>	now we got the final dapper
[none]	[08:32]	<robinl1>	:O
[none]	[08:32]	<herbheart>	swarmz, U6.06 will not come with Gnome. Only FVWM and Console
[none]	[08:32]	<Hodapp>	A little trigger-happy on the kickbans, I see.
[none]	[08:32]	<paniq>	what is LTS?
[none]	[08:32]	<eobanb>	long-term support.
[none]	[08:32]	<lastnode>	paniq, Long Term Support
[none]	[08:33]	<paniq>	ok
[none]	[08:33]	<paniq>	?
[none]	[08:33]	<swarmz>	i see
[none]	[08:33]	<khermans>	paniq, Long Testicle Slacks
[none]	[08:33]	<paniq>	what does it mean?
[none]	[08:33]	<lastnode>	Hodapp, trigger happy or not, if you act like a jackass, you will get kicked
[none]	[08:33]	<jrsims>	shoot. do I need to repoint my repositories to get dapper?
[negative]	[08:33]	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: take a look at this: http://www.tectonic.co.za/view.php?id=916
[none]	[08:33]	<spikeb>	Hodapp, it's being going nuts here all night.
[none]	[08:33]	<Seveas>	Hodapp, yes, as long as people are going crazy I'll be quick on the trigger
[none]	[08:33]	<khermans>	paniq, you only need these pants if you have bug balls
[none]	[08:33]	<eobanb>	paniq, it indicates that 6.06 will be supported by canonical ltd for a long time.
[none]	[08:33]	<lastnode>	Hodapp, it's called natural selection. join #ubuntu-offtopic for everything offtopic, like i kept telling you

[none]	[08:34]	<Fujitsu>	makelele, what delay!?
[none]	[08:34]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	but all ok
[positive]	[08:34]	<lastnode>	Seveas, apparently, yes :)
[none]	[08:34]	<jrsims>	Do I need to repoint my repositories to get the freshest dapper?
[none]	[08:34]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	just that
[none]	[08:34]	<GianLuigiBuffon>	thks buddie
[none]	[08:34]	<Fujitsu>	jrsims, no.
[none]	[08:34]	<khermans>	I've never seen so many people geek out over a release
[none]	[08:34]	<rahonavis>	this channel almost has 900 people in it.  about the size of a small town.
[none]	[08:34]	<jrsims>	yay
[none]	[08:34]	<eobanb>	jrsims, if you're already running dapper, then no.
[none]	[08:34]	<Seveas>	lastnode, I cleared out all bans yesterday 
[positive]	[08:34]	<lastnode>	jrsims, dapper is coming at its freshest :) there are no separate repos
[none]	[08:34]	<bill>	hey bill
[none]	[08:34]	<bill>	lol
[none]	[08:34]	<bill>	its me
[none]	[08:34]	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: did you get my link?
[none]	[08:34]	<Fujitsu>	jrsims, the update tool will handle it for you
[none]	[08:35]	<jrsims>	JoseStefan: I did. Looking at it now.
[none]	[08:35]	<Graig>	wow that's alot of people.
[positive]	[08:35]	<lastnode>	Seveas, to make room, eh? :)
[none]	[08:35]	<Seveas>	lastnode, hehe
[none]	[08:35]	<intelikey>	rahonavis very very very small town.
[none]	[08:35]	<dholbach>	khermans: me neither
[positive]	[08:35]	<paniq>	"lastnode, and dont forget, whenever you kick people, you have an influence on the stats. its better to say ""on the day of release, #ubuntu had 1288239293 individuals"" instead of just... 900 ;)"
[none]	[08:35]	<jrsims>	I wonder of the latest Suse got this much fanfare...
[none]	[08:35]	<lastnode>	Seveas, when you got a moment for a /query, let me know
[none]	[08:35]	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: i suggest creating a new user for compiz/xgl
[positive]	[08:35]	<khermans>	dholbach, says something about our community :-)
[positive]	[08:35]	<jon_>	Ah, that's weird.  Dapper doesn't come with X-chat.  Had to install it.  but that's offtopic: my real point: Are you guys doing dapper support right now? or do I have to wait for the official release? :)
[none]	[08:35]	<Seveas>	lastnode, no need to ask for that 
[positive]	[08:35]	<rahonavis>	intelikey, yes you are correct :)  perhaps with a goat that is mayor and drinks beer for lunch somewhere down in the rural areas of texas :)
[positive]	[08:35]	<lastnode>	paniq, does anybody really care how many people were in #ubuntu? :)
[none]	[08:35]	<jrsims>	JoseStefan: good call
[none]	[08:35]	<eobanb>	wacky.  we're about to pass #gentoo as the most populous channel; at least temporarily.
[none]	[08:35]	<ryno>	This channel reminds me of the credits for a t.v. program. You can't keep up with all the text scrolling down the screen.
[none]	[08:35]	<lastnode>	Seveas, as in?
[none]	[08:36]	<Seveas>	khermans: that they're insane?
[positive]	[08:36]	<paniq>	lastnode: independent blogs :D
[none]	[08:36]	<JoseStefan>	jrsims: that user will use the sample .xsession file
[none]	[08:36]	<Seveas>	lastnode, as in: you can always pm
[none]	[08:36]	<khermans>	Seveas, hey i didnt say it
[none]	[08:36]	<Seveas>	khermans, no, but you know it 
[none]	[08:36]	<intelikey>	rahonavis oh you've been here ?
[none]	[08:36]	<herbheart>	ryno - that's true and funny
[none]	[08:36]	<myleftfoot>	eoband, we did that already earlier. we went up to around 930
[none]	[08:36]	<paniq>	lastnode: when there are no stories to tell, there will be no hero to remember.
[none]	[08:36]	<rahonavis>	no intelikey though there exists such a town with a goat as a mayor.
[positive]	[08:36]	<lastnode>	paniq, ooh, profound. :)
[none]	[08:37]	<khermans>	Seveas, i did write a script to SMS me in case I fall asleep and Dapper comes out ... cuz I'm gonna torrent it on my University gigabit
[none]	[08:37]	<Watson>	rahonavis: #ubuntu-offtopic
[none]	[08:37]	<scheuri>	hi all
[none]	[08:37]	<rahonavis>	understood
[positive]	[08:37]	<paniq>	lastnode: ;)
[none]	[08:37]	<Watson>	scheuri: greetings are not permitted. Ubuntu talk only.
[none]	[08:37]	<Seveas>	khermans, what does the script do, measure the activity in here? 
[none]	[08:37]	<khermans>	Seveas, lol -- nah greps the releases page
[none]	[08:37]	<khermans>	Seveas, there's no RSS right?
[positive]	[08:37]	<Jeeves_>	Seveas: Watch de traffic peaks on the main ix'es :)
[none]	[08:37]	<rahonavis>	i'm leaving until tomorrow when the final is out
[none]	[08:38]	<scheuri>	Watson: if that is the case...I greet you with my biggest smile I can produce...
[none]	[08:38]	<Seveas>	Jeeves_, lol, do you really think it'll show up?
[none]	[08:38]	<eobanb>	Watson, i don't think that's even been a rule before, or at least not enforced
[none]	[08:38]	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, I've been wondering why you often have that character on the end of your messages... Is it meant to be a smile?
[none]	[08:38]	<Jeeves_>	Seveas: No.
[none]	[08:38]	<jrsims>	Am I the only one who is thinking of ditching work so I can play with dapper?
[none]	[08:38]	<Seveas>	Fujitsu, yes
[none]	[08:38]	<Watson>	jrsims: if I had a job, I'm sure I'd ditch it.
[none]	[08:38]	<lastnode>	jrsims, work? what is work?
[none]	[08:38]	<eobanb>	jrsims, glad to hear you're so enthusiastic
[none]	[08:38]	<JoseStefan>	you could use an http HEAD request on the release directory
[positive]	[08:38]	<Seveas>	Jeeves_, ahhhh, not even a single pixel in the RRD graphs? ;)
[none]	[08:38]	<Watson>	lastnode: this thing where you do stuff and get paid...legally
[none]	[08:38]	<KLineD>	I'll go to work so I can download there
[none]	[08:38]	<lastnode>	Watson, oh, that.
[none]	[08:39]	<l_r>	i think ubuntu actually wins the competition between all the other linux-based distros as italy will win the world cup..people will only talk about ubuntu and italy before july
[none]	[08:39]	<jrsims>	eobanb: yeah, it's weird. I just love ubuntu. It touches me in weird ways in weird places.
[none]	[08:39]	<Watson>	uh...
[none]	[08:39]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, ahh probably a better idea!
[none]	[08:39]	<Watson>	l_r: kinda depends on the market, I think, but who knows...
[none]	[08:39]	<Rambo3>	l_r: italy haha
[none]	[08:39]	<lastnode>	get em while it's hot, children
[positive]	[08:39]	<l_r>	:)

[none]	[08:39]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: looking...
[none]	[08:40]	<eobanb>	khermans, hahaha
[none]	[08:40]	<jrsims>	"I wonder how many people are running ""sudo apt-get upgrade"" right now..."
[positive]	[08:40]	<scheuri>	am I in ubuntu-offtopic or in the support channel? *I can be nagging as well, ;)*
[negative]	[08:40]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: don't know perl :(
[none]	[08:40]	<Watson>	jrsims: I dunno, I'm on Slackware...
[none]	[08:40]	<Madpilot>	scheuri: you're in #ubuntu
[none]	[08:40]	<khermans>	Joetheodd, doh!
[none]	[08:40]	<jrsims>	Watson: why are you in here then?
[none]	[08:40]	<lastnode>	jrsims, 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
[none]	[08:40]	<neutrinomass>	F-Spot is in mono ?
[positive]	[08:40]	<lastnode>	:)
[none]	[08:40]	<Watson>	jrsims: curiosity
[positive]	[08:40]	<jrsims>	lastnode: yeah, I just ran it too. :)
[none]	[08:40]	<herbheart>	F-Spot sucks
[none]	[08:41]	<Watson>	jrsims: will likely try Ubuntu soon
[positive]	[08:41]	<scheuri>	Madpilot: thanks, I perfectly know...;)..I was just joking
[none]	[08:41]	<Fujitsu>	Better, Seveas.
[positive]	[08:41]	<lastnode>	jrsims, i think we're running dapper!! woot xD
[none]	[08:41]	<neutrinomass>	herbheart: Likely, but that's not the point ...
[none]	[08:41]	<ajmitch_>	neutrinomass: yes, it uses mono
[none]	[08:41]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: that part doesn't do the checking, does it?
[none]	[08:41]	<jrsims>	Watson: it really is good. I also used slackware for a while.
[none]	[08:41]	<Watson>	herbheart: I like digiKam, even with all of KDE's KraKK KoKaine apps
[none]	[08:41]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, yeah, in wget
[none]	[08:41]	<neutrinomass>	ajmitch_: Is obtaining a backtrace for a mono app any different? I think debug symbols don't show, right ?
[none]	[08:41]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, i grep the output of wget -- very hacky
[none]	[08:41]	<Saj>	t-18 minutes
[none]	[08:41]	<herbheart>	F-Spot runs on top of mono yes it does
[positive]	[08:41]	<lastnode>	so wants to hit up a tropical DRP? - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SriLankanTeam/DapperReleaseParty :)
[none]	[08:41]	<intelikey>	Watson it's just a linux distro.
[none]	[08:41]	<Watson>	intelikey: I am aware...
[negative]	[08:42]	<Phlosten>	aww no party near me :(
[none]	[08:42]	<Fujitsu>	Saj, I could have sworn it was 18 hours, not 18 minutes.
[none]	[08:42]	<lastnode>	Phlosten, organize one
[none]	[08:42]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, what is the syntax of a HEAD request?
[none]	[08:42]	<Watson>	What's with all the apps on Mono? I'm just curious why they use Mono.
[none]	[08:42]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: head should be more efficient, but you'd have to program it
[none]	[08:42]	<ajmitch_>	neutrinomass: you'll generally want the exception traceback that f-spot spits out - what problem are you having?
[none]	[08:42]	<Fujitsu>	Phlosten, just Adelaide and Sydney.
[positive]	[08:42]	<Phlosten>	lastnode, will be a large party with 1 attendee :)
[none]	[08:42]	<Seveas>	khermans, lynx -dump -head
[none]	[08:42]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, I can use netcat
[none]	[08:42]	<lastnode>	Phlosten, get people!
[none]	[08:42]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you'd have to send HTTP headers, with an if-modified-since flag
[none]	[08:42]	<neutrinomass>	ajmitch_: Just ran across bug #47807
[none]	[08:42]	<herbheart>	Watson, c# and the mono platform are pretty cool and powerful
[negative]	[08:42]	<Watson>	except when they fail to work :\
[positive]	[08:42]	<Saj>	fujitso: releasing @ 1st jun....18 minutes till 1st jun in california :)

[none]	[08:43]	<Watson>	hmmm
[none]	[08:43]	<dhjohnson3>	i'm allergic to chunder

[none]	[08:46]	<JoseStefan>	"khermans: ""lynx"" can show you, i think"
[none]	[08:46]	<khermans>	Linuturk, i hope there were some dongle ports too
[none]	[08:46]	<Graig>	my computer is acting wierd.

[none]	[08:47]	<scheuri>	Josh43: yes, that might be true...on the other hand...its free...and you haven't paid for it and...I personally prefer polished LTS.capable distro over punctual release...but that is only me
[none]	[08:47]	<digerati>	lol dongle ports
[none]	[08:47]	<sam__>	Josh43: nope
[none]	[08:47]	<khermans>	apparantly ubuntu-women.org supports women using Ubuntu, so there must only be like 1.5% dognle ports available at the release parties, compared to 98.5% dongles
[none]	[08:47]	<Watson>	lol dumb innuendo
[none]	[08:47]	<sam__>	MDT is.
[none]	[08:47]	<herbheart>	Watson, I use mpd (musidpd.org) but I don't have an ipod
[none]	[08:47]	<Watson>	herbheart: I don't have an iPod either. But I am in a college dorm with a lot of people sharing music over iTunes.
[none]	[08:47]	<Madpilot>	khermans: mind the CoC, please...
[none]	[08:47]	<VR_>	herbheart: do you know of any equalizer plugins for mpd?
[none]	[08:48]	<khermans>	Madpilot, ok ill won
[none]	[08:48]	<Watson>	I used to use MusicPD on my very slow server - it was great
[none]	[08:48]	<khermans>	Madpilot, ill keep my CoC away from the dongle parties
[positive]	[08:48]	<Josh43>	scheuri: Oh, of course - I'm not arguing, I'm just going over what I'm going to do with dapper final :) Been testing and loving it, now format
[positive]	[08:48]	<intelikey>	"scheuri no.  it's not ""only you""  :)"
[positive]	[08:48]	<scheuri>	intelikey: thanks...;)
[none]	[08:48]	<herbheart>	VR_ no eq for mpd. I use an external hardware mixer with an eq
[none]	[08:48]	<EpicWang>	gonna go try my xgl sweetness!
[none]	[08:48]	<khermans>	ipod support in Dapper is awesome
[none]	[08:48]	<EpicWang>	later
[none]	[08:48]	<VR_>	herbheart: ah, ok.
[none]	[08:48]	<herbheart>	I've been searching for an eq for mpd since I met mpd
[positive]	[08:49]	<scheuri>	Josh43: okay, no worries..:)...I am using it now for a couple of weeks myself...looks very good...still, loads of people complain and I thing that is unfair
[none]	[08:49]	<VR_>	herbheart: if it had one, i wouldn't use anything else
[none]	[08:49]	<La_PaRCa>	Gotta reformat for dapper. Been running the same testing rig since hoary and now its being eaten alive by bitrot.
[none]	[08:49]	<Watson>	herbheart: there are EQs for ALSA and OSS, most likely.
[none]	[08:49]	<scheuri>	Josh43: and I mean complain in a bad manner...not the constructive critics
[none]	[08:49]	<_kadaj_3>	hi all
[none]	[08:49]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you might have to run that HEAD request on a specific file, i suggest the MD5SUMS file
[none]	[08:49]	<_kadaj_3>	is that ubuntu 6.06 released?
[none]	[08:49]	<Watson>	What backends does mpd have again? I know it has esd, OSS, ALSA... what about JACK?
[none]	[08:49]	<VR_>	Watson: i searched for that stuff too, but never foiund anything
[none]	[08:49]	<herbheart>	yes Eq for Alsa, OSS and Jack, I think are why mpd doesn't do eq
[none]	[08:49]	<eobanb>	_kadaj_3, no.  read the topic please

[positive]	[08:50]	<scheuri>	Josh43: heh, couldn't point it out better...:)
[none]	[08:50]	<JoseStefan>	Can the output of lynx be done to stdout ?
[none]	[08:50]	<eobanb>	_kadaj_3, your point?
[none]	[08:50]	<Seveas>	_kadaj_3, today still has 17 hours and 10 minutes left
[none]	[08:50]	<_kadaj_3>	ok
[none]	[08:50]	<herbheart>	June 1 means anytime before June 2
[none]	[08:50]	<Madpilot>	actually, it's not even June 1st yet, not for 11 more minutes
[none]	[08:51]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, i still dont see how to check the links in a HEAD request
[none]	[08:51]	<IsItOutYet>	it is on my time zone
[none]	[08:51]	<eobanb>	Madpilot, depends on where you are.
[none]	[08:51]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: working on something for you...
[none]	[08:51]	<herbheart>	it's almost 2 hours in june you liar
[none]	[08:51]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, im trying ti with nc, but only get the real header -- no content
[none]	[08:51]	<_kadaj_3>	are you all waiting it release
[none]	[08:51]	<Saj>	 mins
[none]	[08:51]	<[1] Jess>	so  what was all this talk of Ubuntu having to many bugs for 5 year LTS?  did that get somewhat resolved?
[none]	[08:51]	<Saj>	9mins
[none]	[08:51]	<Josh43>	Anyone: Is there an rss feed to the torrent when it drops?
[none]	[08:51]	<Unenvarjo>	here it's soon 10 am
[negative]	[08:51]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: try this: lynx -head http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/MD5SUMS
[positive]	[08:51]	<Saj>	if not i coming to kill ubuntu team :D :P
[none]	[08:51]	<Seveas>	eobanb, ubuntu counts in UTC 
[none]	[08:51]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: that will give you an idea
[none]	[08:51]	<eobanb>	[1] Jess, it's nothing to be worried about anymore.
[none]	[08:51]	<myleftfoot>	JoseStefan: i don't know about lynx but w3m has the  -dump_head       dump response of HEAD request into stdout
[none]	[08:51]	<khermans>	Josh43, i wish -- dont think so -- see my script
[none]	[08:52]	<neutrinomass>	[1] Jess: Dapper has tens of thousands of bugs. Like all distros, like all versions of Windows. The problem is the critical bugs, which AFAIK have been mostly resolved....
[none]	[08:52]	<scheuri>	[1] Jess: Ubuntu has over 10'000 pakets of software available...I guess we agree that it is impossible to have a perfect release...but still, most of the troubles are resolved I guess...
[none]	[08:52]	<Josh43>	khermans: Where at? SOmeone should get on that - all the torrent apps take rss feeds these days, and the more the merrier
[none]	[08:52]	<IsItOutYet>	khermans, can you link that there script so it uploads the corresponding rss feed?
[none]	[08:52]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, still not a head request there...but good call!
[none]	[08:52]	<JoseStefan>	myleftfoot: i think i found it for lynx, it's -dump
[none]	[08:52]	<intelikey>	lynx | tee file.name     works too
[none]	[08:52]	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, which RSS feed?
[none]	[08:52]	<scheuri>	[1] Jess: hoewever, if you encounter one...plesae let the devs know it with as many information possible
[none]	[08:52]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: this is the final statement:
[none]	[08:52]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: this is the final statement:
[none]	[08:52]	<Graig>	cept there's bugs in the gnome-screensaver package.
[none]	[08:52]	<encompass>	goodness the channel is nuts today
[none]	[08:52]	<JoseStefan>	oops

[none]	[08:53]	<mjb>	Hey can 'Always on visible Workspace' be set via command line?
[none]	[08:53]	<eobanb>	tdn, if you know, then why did you ask?
[none]	[08:53]	<Bilford>	I think in 7 minutes
[none]	[08:54]	<tdn>	eobanb: just for fun.
[none]	[08:54]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, what, should I go by the E-Tag?
[none]	[08:54]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you'd want to monitor the last-modified field
[none]	[08:54]	<Seveas>	dholbach, i wish they could....
[none]	[08:54]	<eobanb>	tdn, we get someone like you asking every 10 minutes, all right?
[none]	[08:54]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: etag is another way

[none]	[08:54]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, what is someone modifies, but not putting Dapper up?
[positive]	[08:54]	<scheuri>	Seveas, dholbach...if they did, we'd miss all the fun here, righ? ;)
[none]	[08:54]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: at least you'll have a reason to take a look at the website
[none]	[08:54]	<dholbach>	IsItOutYet: I won't stop you guys.
[none]	[08:55]	<JoseStefan>	khermans: you'll know something has changed
[none]	[08:55]	<intelikey>	encompass the channel is nuts today... in yellow....  as in just before red.
[none]	[08:55]	<khermans>	IsItOutYet, if you think of a way to auto download the torrent, i don't know what the final name of the torrent will be
[positive]	[08:55]	<dholbach>	scheuri: oh well - I guess there's enough of fun out there for eveyrone. :-)
[positive]	[08:55]	<scheuri>	dholbach: ;)
[none]	[08:55]	<mjb>	Hey can 'Always on visible Workspace' be set via command line?
[none]	[08:55]	<IsItOutYet>	khermans, you could always use curl to get those headers as well
[none]	[08:55]	<[1] Jess>	"does anyone know if the RC was taken as the ""final"" version?"
[none]	[08:55]	<Fujitsu>	mjb, I don't think so.
[none]	[08:55]	<dholbach>	!patience
[none]	[08:55]	<JoseStefan>	"khermans: remember that currently holds the RC from the 25th, so any change should be for the ""final"""
[none]	[08:55]	<Fujitsu>	[1] Jess, there have been a number of changes.

[none]	[09:01]	<Bilford>	it;s 07:00, but still not out
[none]	[09:01]	<Shotgun>	hey, does unbuntu have systems in place to prevent particular programs from using lots of memory? i ask as i have a c program with a hash table and the program seg faults unless i have a frustratingly small table size
[none]	[09:01]	<intelikey>	hmm i can't cp and paste it either.
[none]	[09:01]	<Mithrandir>	Madpilot: Canonical it's based in the Isle of Man.
[none]	[09:01]	<tapio_>	When I change root password, Sudo doesn't seem to update to the new root password, must i specify a 'sudo password' or something?
[none]	[09:01]	<[1] Jess>	true.  but I was reading and apparently there's bugs if you use kubuntu before hand
[none]	[09:01]	<mjb>	Has anyone used (wmctrl) for setting up windows as always on?
[negative]	[09:01]	<VR_>	i hate that dapper splashscreen on bootup :(
[none]	[09:01]	<Madpilot>	Mithrandir: only the lawyer's office. The actual office is in London, I'm pretty sure
[none]	[09:01]	<Mithrandir>	tapio_: your sudo password is your user password, not your root password.
[none]	[09:01]	<eobanb>	tapio_, sudo uses the password for the user logged in
[none]	[09:01]	<eobanb>	!tell tapio_ about sudo
[none]	[09:01]	<DarkTower>	oo man its only changed to 18 hours. looking like 2nd
[none]	[09:02]	<Josh43>	    
[positive]	[09:02]	<tapio_>	Oh, that sounds pretty unsecure. I'll read about it before complaining though. Thanks :)
[positive]	[09:02]	<robitaille>	Madpilot:  officially Canonical is based at the Isle of Man...end of the official story  :)
[positive]	[09:02]	<guillem101>	Bilford, 9:00 right here :-P
[none]	[09:02]	<JoseStefan>	a lot of people seem to be grabbing the daily
[none]	[09:02]	<robitaille>	Madpilot: unofficially, I think it is a bank office
[none]	[09:02]	<intelikey>	!tell tapio about sudo
[none]	[09:02]	<eobanb>	already did that, intelikey
[none]	[09:02]	<eobanb>	tapio_, using sudo is arguably only less secure if you unnecessarily enable the root user itself, as you have.
[none]	[09:03]	<Josh43>	,
[none]	[09:03]	<encompass>	Josh43: haha
[none]	[09:03]	<mjb>	does anyone here use wmcntrl ?

[none]	[09:03]	<eobanb>	protocol1, read the topic please.
[none]	[09:03]	<mjb>	yup
[none]	[09:04]	<tapio_>	eobanb: Ok, so only the main user I set up when installing will have the ability to use sudo?
[none]	[09:04]	<JoseStefan>	it's the 1st on PST
[none]	[09:04]	<Josh43>	DarkTower: Enjoying the freedom of ubuntu smilies
[none]	[09:04]	<encompass>	mjb: yeah I use it alot
[none]	[09:04]	<eobanb>	tapio_, that's the default configuration for sudo, yes.
[none]	[09:04]	<DarkTower>	Josh43: oops katakana
[none]	[09:04]	<mjb>	can you set always on proerty on a window?
[none]	[09:04]	<Seveas>	gucharmap
[none]	[09:04]	<mejobloggs>	is ubuntu 64-bit very good? Or is it best to stick to 32 ?
[none]	[09:04]	<DarkTower>	Josh43: hehe sweet
[none]	[09:04]	<eobanb>	tapio_, it'd be pretty damn silly if every user on the machine was in sudoers
[positive]	[09:04]	<Josh43>	DarkTower: THe last one was hebrew ;)
[none]	[09:04]	<mjb>	I want to be able to drag a window to a second screen and have it automatically set
[none]	[09:04]	<eobanb>	mejobloggs, it's fine except when trying to run certain 32-bit software.
[none]	[09:05]	<Madpilot>	tapio_: you can add other uses to the sudo list, if you want to
[none]	[09:05]	<eobanb>	mejobloggs, if you're running only free software, then you should have no problem at all.
[none]	[09:05]	<DarkTower>	Josh43: ubuntu rocks
[none]	[09:05]	<Madpilot>	other users, rather
[none]	[09:05]	<Josh43>	DarkTower: Hai!
[none]	[09:05]	<intelikey>	eobanb so if i try to hack your box and i use user name eoban  and you have used sudo in the last 15 minutes i have full root access ?
[none]	[09:05]	<voraistos>	Josh43, DarkTower: is there any good support on ubuntu for asian languages like on windows ?
[none]	[09:05]	<mejobloggs>	eobanb: sweet, thanks for that. Does 64 give any advantage?
[none]	[09:05]	<encompass>	mjb no idea

[none]	[09:05]	<DarkTower>	Josh43: bonsai!!!!!!!!!!
[none]	[09:05]	<Josh43>	voraistos: MUCH better than windows
[none]	[09:05]	<Seveas>	ZOMG PONIES EDGY HAS BEEN RELEASED
[none]	[09:05]	<mjb>	oahh no worries
[none]	[09:06]	<Shotgun>	is there any cmd that allows programs to use more RAM?
[positive]	[09:06]	<ice_1963>	:)
[none]	[09:06]	<Fujitsu>	voraistos, Japanese support is great!
[none]	[09:06]	<Shotgun>	or a particular program
[none]	[09:06]	<Josh43>	Seveas: ROXZORZ
[none]	[09:06]	<mjb>	cool program though...
[none]	[09:06]	<Healot>	64bit application has the memory space advantage, maybe processing speed too
[none]	[09:06]	<Seveas>	
[positive]	[09:06]	<Madpilot>	Seveas: is this another op's cue to ban you now? ;)
[none]	[09:06]	<Healot>	tsu
[none]	[09:06]	<protocol1>	I am using the beta version....whats the command to upgrade to the official once its released?
[positive]	[09:06]	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, that deserves a kick :P
[positive]	[09:06]	<voraistos>	Josh43: can u explain? what about kanji support, spelling etc ?
[none]	[09:06]	<eobanb>	intelikey, first of all the box i'm running on right now is a powerbook with mac os x.  second of all, you'd have to know my user's password.  third of all, i'm not running ssh on here.  fourth i've changed sudo's config to be five minutes instead of 15
[none]	[09:06]	<eobanb>	intelikey, but you're welcome to try anyway...
[none]	[09:07]	<Seveas>	Fujitsu, true
[none]	[09:07]	<Healot>	voraistos: all even the interface could be in Japanese
[none]	[09:07]	<IsItOutYet>	
[none]	[09:07]	<protocol1>	I am using the beta version....whats the command to upgrade to the official once its released?
[none]	[09:07]	<Josh43>	voraistos: I'm not the best person to ask, but I have never had a problem reading, browsing, using different applications with Kanji (I don't understand it, but by default I can see it all works)
[none]	[09:07]	<eobanb>	protocol1, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[09:07]	<JoseStefan>	Seveas, i could have slapped you with a large trout instead...
[none]	[09:07]	<protocol1>	ok
[none]	[09:07]	<Seveas>	JoseStefan, I prefer salmon
[none]	[09:07]	<intelikey>	eobanb i'm no hacker.   but you pointed out that, you do not use the 'default' sudo setup.    that's all i was about.  the default is not more secure.
[none]	[09:08]	<Fujitsu>	Tuna!
[negative]	[09:08]	<JoseStefan>	Seveas: don't have salmon :(
[none]	[09:08]	<rixxon>	if i do ctrl+alt+backspace, will all programs end?
[none]	[09:08]	<Madpilot>	rixxon: yes
[none]	[09:08]	<Mithrandir>	intelikey: the default also requires you to control the same tty.
[none]	[09:08]	<dhjohnson3>	yes, forever
[none]	[09:08]	<rixxon>	Madpilot: ok thank you
[none]	[09:08]	<eobanb>	intelikey, then again, ubuntu doesnt run sshd by default, so i think the point is fairly moot.  if you care to discuss it more i'm in #ubuntu-offtopic
[positive]	[09:08]	<voraistos>	Josh43: the thing is windows has got a very complete support for japanese, and i wouldnt expectGNU/linux to ave such a thing.
[none]	[09:08]	<Mithrandir>	rixxon: you're not guaranteed that, but yes, usually.
[none]	[09:08]	<Josh43>	yikes cute: 
[none]	[09:08]	<myleftfoot>	rixxon: the ones running in X yes
[positive]	[09:08]	<KLineD>	later guys, happy dapper day and happy downloading :)
[none]	[09:08]	<rixxon>	i see
[none]	[09:08]	<guillem101>	rixxon, not the srervices
[none]	[09:09]	<lightstar>	is dapper officially out?
[none]	[09:09]	<eobanb>	voraistos, ubuntu has fairly good support for many languages, in fact
[none]	[09:09]	<eobanb>	lightstar, no
[none]	[09:09]	<eobanb>	lightstar, read the topic please
[none]	[09:09]	<mejobloggs>	i guess the download servers are going to be pretty maxed out when it is ou
[none]	[09:09]	<rapha>	will you use the torrent network for download?
[positive]	[09:09]	<Jeeves_>	lightstar: See topic :)
[none]	[09:09]	<Josh43>	voraistos: I always had a problem with even trying to get the characters to show up properly.. If in doubt: try a livecd
[none]	[09:09]	<lightstar>	eobanb, oops..sorry
[none]	[09:09]	<eobanb>	rapha, you can if you like
[none]	[09:09]	<DarkTower>	voraistos: : Ubuntu rips XO support
[none]	[09:09]	<stjepan>	is dapper out?
[none]	[09:09]	<lightstar>	Jeeves_, missed the topic...oops
[negative]	[09:09]	<mejobloggs>	my IP blocks torrents !! :(
[none]	[09:09]	<Healot>	voraistos: you can add Japanese or other language support in ubuntu
[none]	[09:09]	<rapha>	yea, I'm just curious who's going to use it
[none]	[09:09]	<eobanb>	stjepan, NO, please read the topic
[none]	[09:10]	<DarkTower>	stjepan: not yet
[none]	[09:10]	<eobanb>	rapha, for people already running ubuntu it's probably better just to use apt
[none]	[09:10]	<JoseStefan>	17 hours to go
[none]	[09:10]	<DarkTower>	!dapper
[none]	[09:10]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours, but not at 0:00 UTC! (NO, we cannot be more precise)
[none]	[09:10]	<intelikey>	Mithrandir not really.  it only requires a tty takeover for the timed method  but the user password is the point.   not just the timed method.    but i know and don't dispute that a properly setup sudo is a more secure approach.
[positive]	[09:10]	<Josh43>	voraistos: Case and point:  means system :)
[none]	[09:10]	<DarkTower>	eobanb: is the upgrade from breezy stable??
[none]	[09:11]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, what do you mean, exactly
[none]	[09:11]	<redraslo>	DarkTower: do you mean the current RC?
[none]	[09:11]	<Fujitsu>	Case in point, you mean, Josh43?
[none]	[09:11]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, using dist-upgrade i've had basically no real problems, and i even upgraded to dapper about a month ago.
[positive]	[09:11]	<voraistos>	i already am using ubuntu folks;) ,and i am not talking about the interface language :p. (and yea i have a JP keyboard.) however ill take a look into that. try to use (just for a test) a JP keyboard with language bar and all that shit in windows, thats just awesome. I respect MS for hat.
[none]	[09:11]	<DarkTower>	eobanb: you were saying i thought that people already running ubuntu should use apt-get to upgrade instead of new install, but maybe i misread soz
[none]	[09:11]	<Josh43>	Fujitsu: Nope
[none]	[09:11]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, that's right.
[none]	[09:12]	<DarkTower>	eobanb: oo, k. this is my work machine though. would be a bit scared lol.
[none]	[09:12]	<Healot>	voraistos: nihongo wo shaberu?
[none]	[09:12]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, well you should be backing up your data regardless.

[none]	[09:12]	<eobanb>	rixth, take it to #ubuntu-offtopic please
[positive]	[09:12]	<voraistos>	Healot: yep, more for my girl than myself ;)

[none]	[09:13]	<DarkTower>	eobanb: thanks for the help. What would be best, just back up my home directory?
[none]	[09:13]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, probably.
[negative]	[09:13]	<Nigel>	how is everyone going to know when it is released?  hitting refresh on the http://www.ubuntu.com/download page?
[none]	[09:13]	<OmniD>	YEP

[positive]	[09:13]	<voraistos>	OmniD: yea i have to take a look into that, so i can convert my girlfriend to ubuntu ;)
[none]	[09:13]	<Fujitsu>	Nigel, looking for the news on Ubuntu.com... Reading ubuntu-announce... Reading here...
[none]	[09:13]	<Healot>	voraistos: you can either change the keyboardto Japanese and isntall iimf/anthy/scim for Japanese input/dictionary
[none]	[09:14]	<paniq>	hm
[none]	[09:14]	<DarkTower>	eobanb: cheers. will it change the theme and look all new and everything. Dont mean to sound like a kid about a new toy lol
[positive]	[09:14]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, i don't expect you to encounter any major problems when doing dist-upgrade, but you should hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[none]	[09:14]	<paniq>	where in my user profile are the application menus stored?

[none]	[09:14]	<joshhendo>	aztun: yes
[none]	[09:14]	<eobanb>	DarkTower, doing sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will prompt you to either use your existing gnome config or replace it with the package maintainer's version
[none]	[09:14]	<occhi>	so when the new release is out, can you just do a apt-get distupgrade?
[none]	[09:14]	<DapperLad>	Just kidding...

[none]	[09:15]	<intelikey>	well  i haven't seen anyone for tech help in a while.   sorry if i missed you.     i'm outa here.  dapper can release without me just fine.
[none]	[09:15]	<joshhendo>	aztun: I will get you a link

[none]	[09:15]	<IsItOutYet>	occhi, yes

[none]	[09:16]	<_kadaj_3>	hahaha
[none]	[09:16]	<voraistos>	intelikey: but the nu ubuntu version release is more important than changing the millenium !
[none]	[09:16]	<dholbach>	occhi: you can upgrade now already
[none]	[09:16]	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: ah, okay...well...no idea..never done that with my computer (only router stuff)
[positive]	[09:16]	<rapha>	they should release the next version at 0:00 next time  - they would save a lot of bandwidth from all the people reloading all the time or using scripts :))
[none]	[09:17]	<occhi>	eoband, im confused as to what i missed in the topic?
[none]	[09:17]	<occhi>	eobanb*
[none]	[09:17]	<gambit>	in dpkg-reconfigure locales, how do i select the box
[positive]	[09:17]	<_kadaj_3>	:D
[none]	[09:17]	<eobanb>	occhi, how about the part where it says 'Ubuntu 6.06 LTS 'Dapper Drake' will be released in less than 18 hours!'
[none]	[09:17]	<scheuri>	gambit: spacebar doenst work?
[none]	[09:17]	<occhi>	eobanb, my question was regarding how to upgrade my current install when it is released
[none]	[09:17]	<Healot>	my personal favorite of Japanese Input > IIMF+Anthy engine
[none]	[09:18]	<dhjohnson3>	so what exactly are the developers or whomever doing right now?
[none]	[09:18]	<gambit>	spacebar nor x or #
[none]	[09:18]	<Flannel>	occhi: you don't need to do anything.  update-notifier will ask you if you want to update
[positive]	[09:18]	<hyphenated>	dhjohnson3: hiding ;-)
[none]	[09:18]	<Xore>	dhjohnson3: enjoying a beer and watching us all panic
[none]	[09:18]	<dhjohnson3>	d'oh!
[none]	[09:18]	<scheuri>	dhjohnson3: probably they are at work? (its about 0800 in London, isnt it?)
[none]	[09:18]	<dhjohnson3>	double do'h!
[none]	[09:18]	<ubuntubes>	scheuri : so only router can do that? how about the ubuntu server? can it be?
[none]	[09:18]	<timfrost>	!upgrade
[negative]	[09:18]	<ubotu>	"well, upgrade is Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo ""update-manager -d"" always updates to the bleeding edge."

[none]	[09:19]	<dhjohnson3>	but wouldn't they have been at work since way before midnight london time?
[none]	[09:19]	<gambit>	scheuri: nvm,  ty vmuch
[none]	[09:19]	<Flannel>	occhi: you'll have an icon on the top right of your screen, should be pretty apparent.
[none]	[09:19]	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: if you configure your ubuntu server to be a router (having at least 2 NICs) then you may...yes.
[positive]	[09:19]	<scheuri>	gambit: easy...:)
[none]	[09:19]	<dhjohnson3>	protocoll, so how do they decide when to cut things off?
[none]	[09:19]	<eobanb>	dhjohnson3, they just decide
[none]	[09:19]	<scheuri>	ubuntubes: but I never had a linux system configured as router...so I am no help here, sorry
[none]	[09:19]	<protocol1>	when all of thier objectives been completed
[none]	[09:19]	<Nigel>	I wonder what the differences will be between the latest RC and the final release.  I'm going to feel like I wasted my time waiting for the final if it's not something significant.
[none]	[09:20]	<paniq>	nigel, no big difference
[none]	[09:20]	<protocol1>	there is a doc about the dapper goals somewhere I forget
[positive]	[09:20]	<ubuntubes>	scheuri : :)
[none]	[09:20]	<scheuri>	Nigel it is quite unlikely a big diff...
[none]	[09:20]	<paniq>	nigel, i think some random icon touchups a few small updates, nothing fancy.
[none]	[09:20]	<eobanb>	Nigel, it's not anything significant, really.
[none]	[09:20]	<IsItOutYet>	"Nigel, probably wont be a big difference. That why its called a ""Release Candidate"""

[none]	[09:43]	<DarkTower>	Fujitsu: ok sorry
[none]	[09:43]	<montbazin>	Flannel: it's a music software which generates an accompagniment to play with.
[none]	[09:43]	<BadriNarayan>	"about ubuntu's samba: isn't there anybody else who thinks ""security=share"" should be default?"
[none]	[09:43]	<Fujitsu>	No.
[none]	[09:43]	<dooglus>	Josh43: no, less than 18 hours
[none]	[09:43]	<Flannel>	DarkTower: I'm fully aware of what irrational numbers are.  It's just been a long day.
[none]	[09:43]	<DarkTower>	BadriNarayan: no security=share is not secure. Linux doesnt put unsafe things as defualt
[none]	[09:43]	<tritium>	Flannel: the irrationals are countably infinite, actually.  See Cantor's diagonilization proof for details
[none]	[09:43]	<Josh43>	dooglus: ?
[negative]	[09:43]	<joshhendo>	http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily/current/ ?
[none]	[09:43]	<BadriNarayan>	I see thanks darktower
[none]	[09:44]	<tritium>	diagonalization, even
[none]	[09:44]	<Fujitsu>	joshhendo, your point?
[none]	[09:44]	<nomin>	in what ways is dapper better than breezy?
[none]	[09:44]	<DarkTower>	Flannel: sorry about that, same here, was being argumentative.
[none]	[09:44]	<Flannel>	tritium: right, that's the point.
[none]	[09:44]	<myleftfoot>	joshhendo: that's just the daily build
[none]	[09:44]	<joshhendo>	ok
[none]	[09:44]	<BeNi>	!upgrade
[negative]	[09:44]	<joshhendo>	I just wanted to know if that was the final or what :S
[none]	[09:44]	<scheuri>	nomin: newer software, more implementations, new software
[none]	[09:44]	<BadriNarayan>	bad question
[none]	[09:45]	<BadriNarayan>	very risky
[none]	[09:45]	<tritium>	Flannel: your point is what?
[none]	[09:45]	<scheuri>	nomin: where newer software means that software from breezy is in it in a newer version and more software was added
[none]	[09:45]	<nomin>	cool
[none]	[09:45]	<halibut>	montbazin, nothing that I know of
[negative]	[09:45]	<rpedro_>	montbazin: take a look at  http://ubuntustudio.com/
[none]	[09:45]	<nomin>	I hope qjoypad is in dapper
[none]	[09:46]	<halibut>	montbazin, you might be able to run BIAB under linux though
[none]	[09:46]	<nomin>	qjoypad should be available in every distro
[none]	[09:46]	<dooglus>	"Josh43: I had my buffer scrolled up.  I saw ""08:43 < Josh43> 18 hours? damn"" and replied...  about an hour too late."
[none]	[09:46]	<Seveas>	!info qjoypad dapper
[negative]	[09:46]	<nomin>	http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/
[none]	[09:46]	<scheuri>	nomin: I am sure the homepage will have information about the difference
[none]	[09:46]	<Flannel>	tritium: nothing, it's dead.  at a micro scale, irrational numbers are infinite.
[none]	[09:46]	<halibut>	montbazin, do you have the 2006 version?
[none]	[09:46]	<dooglus>	Flannel: no numbers are infinite
[none]	[09:46]	<scheuri>	nomin: gimme a sec I will check
[none]	[09:46]	<DarkTower>	dooglus: yes they are
[none]	[09:46]	<nomin>	qjoypad is a keystroke and mouse emulator for a joystick or gamepad.  It's very useful but no available on ubuntu yet.
[none]	[09:46]	<dooglus>	DarkTower: which ones?
[none]	[09:46]	<Flannel>	dooglus: how many integers are there then?
[none]	[09:47]	<JoseStefan>	isn't Pi infinite?
[none]	[09:47]	<Josh43>	dooglus: Lol - yeah, only a little late. Hey, it's 2am here; where's my Dapper? ;P
[none]	[09:47]	<tritium>	Flannel: scale is irrelevant.  They are countably infinite, Flannel, dooglus.
[none]	[09:47]	<dooglus>	Flannel: all the integers are finite
[none]	[09:47]	<DarkTower>	dooglus: tell me all the decimal places of pi
[none]	[09:47]	<dooglus>	DarkTower: pi is irrational
[none]	[09:47]	<tritium>	no, dooglus.  Okay, let's take this to #ubuntu-offtopic
[none]	[09:47]	<DarkTower>	tritium: he knows that i misunderstood him, its finished
[none]	[09:47]	<dooglus>	DarkTower: but it's not infinite
[none]	[09:47]	<dooglus>	DarkTower: in fact it's less than 7
[none]	[09:47]	<Flannel>	I agree. offtopic for math stuffs.
[none]	[09:47]	<tritium>	dooglus: the _set_ is infinite
[none]	[09:48]	<dooglus>	tritium: yes, that's true.  but the numbers aren't infinite
[none]	[09:48]	<DarkTower>	dooglus: thats the very definition of irational
[none]	[09:48]	<scheuri>	nomin: I am afraid, I cant find anything
[none]	[09:48]	<Seveas>	DarkTower, #ubuntu-offtopic
[none]	[09:48]	<BadriNarayan>	Suppose I wish to write a wishlist for shares-admin to allow adding samba users through GUI. Which package in launchpad should I look at?
[none]	[09:48]	<JoseStefan>	it's a matter of interpretation
[none]	[09:48]	<Seveas>	BadriNarayan, gnome-system-tools
[none]	[09:48]	<nomin>	scheuri:  I'm not too surprised.  I think it's the only program for emulating keystrokes and a mouse with a joystick on linux.
[none]	[09:48]	<BadriNarayan>	Thank you Seveas
[none]	[09:48]	<DarkTower>	Seveas: sorry. i said id stop and kept doing it. I wont continue.

[none]	[09:52]	<eobanb>	perhaps you missed the part, Ocult, where it says '(NO, we cannot be more precise)'
[none]	[09:53]	<BadriNarayan>	It is rather simple:ocult keep wanting
[none]	[09:53]	<mcmahons>	i don't understand why you are getting angry about people asking about when dappers coming out. obviously people are excited, why rain on their parade?
[none]	[09:53]	<eobanb>	mcmahons, because someone asks every five minutes.
[none]	[09:53]	<JoseStefan>	Ocult, if you find anything, you tell us, and we will update everyone
[none]	[09:53]	<Ocult>	[[eobanb] ] : OH.. my anxious made me blank
[none]	[09:53]	<g_c_c>	im probably the only person that doesn't know this, but does kde 3.5 have better accessability support?
[none]	[09:53]	<Fujitsu>	mcmahons, people ask excruciatingly regularly.
[none]	[09:53]	<scheuri>	mcmahons: it is not the asking itself, but probably the numbers of people asking it...and it is written ALL over

[none]	[10:08]	<neutrinomass>	eobanb: It's not a winmodem, it's a USB adsl modem. It works fine, but it doesn't show there.

[none]	[10:08]	<guillem101>	Seveas, we need a channel for our impaciency

[none]	[10:08]	<Healot>	PCI/USB modems are mostly winmodems/software modem, no real modem chipset, emulated and requires CPU power
[none]	[10:08]	<Fujitsu>	Haha
[none]	[10:09]	<neutrinomass>	eobanb: Yes, ATM.
[none]	[10:09]	<McNutella>	scheuri, just like christmas I guessl... tee hee *giggles* yey, wooo!
[none]	[10:09]	<scheuri>	Xore: sorry...how impolite of me...
[none]	[10:09]	<neutrinomass>	Healot: It's a DSL modem. It works fine !
[none]	[10:09]	<eobanb>	neutrinomass, when you say 'modem' we take that to mean '56k modem'
[none]	[10:09]	<scheuri>	McNutella: obvisouly
[none]	[10:09]	<Healot>	well... if you were talking about modem...
[none]	[10:09]	<g-nome>	will the torrent or the mirror be faster
[none]	[10:09]	<Auckland_Pig>	"i did ""update-manager -d"" and am getting too many updates... how do i disable it?"
[none]	[10:09]	<scheuri>	g-nome: depends when you download it
[none]	[10:10]	<OffHand>	torrent probably
[none]	[10:10]	<Healot>	that DSL modem is not really a modem, it;s like a bridge with NAT/DHCP/firewall feature in it
[none]	[10:10]	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, newsflash, computers are complicated
[none]	[10:10]	<neutrinomass>	Anyway. Does anybody know where network-admin looks for network interfaces ?
[none]	[10:10]	<Astinus->	what's the connection between CLOOP and SquashFS?
[none]	[10:10]	<Healot>	i don't recall what they call that DSL device
[none]	[10:10]	<scheuri>	g-nome: torrent might be much faster today and next few days
[none]	[10:10]	<g-nome>	can i downlaod it on mirror and seed it on torrent
[none]	[10:10]	<g-nome>	?
[none]	[10:10]	<neutrinomass>	Healot: Probably. I'm not exactly sure ...
[none]	[10:10]	<Auckland_Pig>	eobanb: please tell how do i disable it?

[none]	[10:10]	<neutrinomass>	"Healot: At least on the manufacturers website (and everywhere I've seen it) it's referred to as an ""adsl modem"""
[none]	[10:11]	<g-nome>	scheuri: well the problem is how to seed it on the dapper tracker?
[none]	[10:11]	<montbazin>	I'v 3 machines connected to a Cisco ethernet rooter, is there a command to se the IP adresses of the other machines ?
[none]	[10:11]	<Healot>	neutrinomass: they just want to make the term to be easy
[none]	[10:11]	<Kr0ntab>	I actually saved the output.  wutta lamer.
[none]	[10:11]	<Healot>	marketing purposes
[none]	[10:11]	<Auckland_Pig>	eobanb: there's this icon in the system tray asking me to update... can i just ignore it/
[positive]	[10:11]	<scheuri>	g-nome: I have no idea...never done it myself...:)
[positive]	[10:11]	<neutrinomass>	Healot: Probably. I guess it doesn't modulate anything at all. Anyway, thanks :)
[none]	[10:11]	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, if you want...i recommend you update, of course
[none]	[10:11]	<disinterested_pe>	well i upgraded and 6.06 is different
[none]	[10:11]	<OffHand>	montbazin, what if you do: ifconfig -a
[none]	[10:11]	<scheuri>	disinterested_pe: I hope it is
[none]	[10:11]	<McNutella>	good for you
[none]	[10:11]	<eobanb>	disinterested_pe, if it was the same, then why would you have upgraded
[none]	[10:11]	<dunnix>	beautiful beautiful   dapper
[none]	[10:11]	<Auckland_Pig>	eobanb: i only have limited bandwidth... and it downloads lots of packages daily
[none]	[10:12]	<Healot>	"neutrinomass: it does modulates, but it doesn't require ""dialing"" >> this what modems suppose to do"
[none]	[10:12]	<eobanb>	Auckland_Pig, well get a CD from shipit then
[none]	[10:12]	<philipacamaniac>	Auckland_Pig:  it will do that until the final release
[positive]	[10:12]	<scheuri>	Auckland_Pig: that will stop as of today...:)

[none]	[10:12]	<scheuri>	Auckland_Pig: I mean....you need to download ALL of them today and after today mostly only security updates occur
[positive]	[10:13]	<JoseStefan>	what can i expect from the dapper-updates repository ?

[none]	[10:15]	<Viaken>	liquidindian: I had that problem with the dapper beta a little earlier. It happened when I would resume from hibernate. Rebooting fixed it, and updating everything fixed it for good.
[none]	[10:15]	<khermans>	JoseStefan, yes it should

[positive]	[10:17]	<mind>	ok, so i've just installed ubuntu, everything seems to be working fine, except screen resolution. I can't set it higher than 1024 x 768, 60 hz.

I have then tried apt-get install unrar-nonfree but i keep getting an error

[none]	[10:26]	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, it is ambiguous.
[none]	[10:26]	<flowolf>	can it be a problem with xfs as / partition?
[none]	[10:26]	<Seveas>	Fujitsu, indeed
[positive]	[10:26]	<onkarshinde>	mcmahons: Voice And Video. There was a seperate fork of Gaim that had implemented it. Plans are to integrate in Gaim. I thought it would be Gaim2. Also I expected at least GTalk VoIP in Gaim2

[none]	[10:26]	<Fujitsu>	`# CDs approved and sent to shipping company' implies the CDs have been sent.

[none]	[10:26]	<reon>	Fujitsu, Well it seems to be on the servers regardless what the topic says. Unless I've got the cat by the tail.
[none]	[10:26]	<Auckland_Pig>	shriphani: you should be able to do that from the GDM login screen
[none]	[10:26]	<eobanb>	reon, if you read the topic, you would see that dapper is not out yet.  and since it's not out yet, ISOs are not yet available.  understand?
[none]	[10:26]	<Seveas>	flowolf, xfs as / is always probelematic if you don't have a separate /boot
[none]	[10:26]	<Polibio>	"Seveas, ""10 CDs approved and sent to the shipping company in 2006-05-24""  the CDs, not the order"", have you a similar phrase?"
[none]	[10:27]	<shriphani>	ok so i type startx ?
[none]	[10:27]	<Viaken>	shriphani: Would involve changing the default runlevel by editing your /etc/grub.conf (or would it be /boot/grub.conf?). I don't know beyond that.
[none]	[10:27]	<Auckland_Pig>	"shriphani: you can try ""alt + F1"""

[none]	[11:24]	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: But not in a way that could could pass your harddisk to feds and be sure that they cannot dig stuff out, that kind of complete removing is more work intensive/takes tools
[none]	[11:24]	<Flannel>	chrisbudden14: no, now server is tuned for server installs.
[none]	[11:24]	<CN_EricNeon>	Seveas: then if Dapper will release when we hit 1100 ?

[none]	[11:26]	<pschulz01>	Are there any torrents?

[none]	[11:27]	<La_PaRCa>	We need some seeders to get in the torrent
[none]	[11:27]	<chrisbudden14>	im getting that as well khermans
[none]	[11:27]	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: Yes and no. Can you start over and tell me what is it that you want to achieve: free disk space, make files 'disappear' or make damn sure no one can ever never get to those files?
[none]	[11:27]	<Linuturk>	start mass producing cd's and overnight them to everyone
[none]	[11:27]	<kane77>	apokryphos, how long does the upgrade take??

[none]	[11:28]	<dooglus>	if you use azureus to connect to the torrent, you can start downloading using dht
[negative]	[11:28]	<khermans>	La_PaRCa, I downloaded the torrents here http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/
[none]	[11:28]	<apokryphos>	kane77: depends on how many things you have installed
[none]	[11:28]	<La_PaRCa>	khermans, check the md6 there with the one from the iso you downloaded
[none]	[11:28]	<Lynoure>	ubuntubes: then careful use of rm -r <directory> will do that for you
[none]	[11:28]	<apokryphos>	kane77: from a default ubuntu probably around 400/500 megs it needs to grab

[none]	[11:52]	<Lukketto>	verythax: did you change your souce-list?
[none]	[11:52]	<OmniD>	120 down is pretty fast
[none]	[11:52]	<Seveas>	Grunt, nl.releases.ubuntu.com
[none]	[11:52]	<PeanutHorst>	Auckland_Pig: depends on the strength of connection, speed of seed host, other leeches, etc.
[none]	[11:52]	<jcz`>	ompaul, how do i login to failsafe terminal ?
[none]	[11:52]	<mnk>	cos my system is saying nothing to upgrade

[none]	[11:59]	<ompaul>	jcz`, if you want a terminal that is where you go, if you want failsafe then you do what I suggested, bottom left of the gui - then log in

[none]	[12:00]	<jcz`>	ompaul, ok i dont see options on my bottom left gui
[none]	[12:00]	<dooglus>	phatmonkey: nothing changed since the pcmcia update a few hours ago
[none]	[12:00]	<cef>	phatmonkey: rsync will update the .iso, or if you've installed, just use apt-get
[none]	[12:00]	<mnk>	is there something like /etc/ubuntu-release ?
[none]	[12:00]	<kbrooks>	why is live AND desktop good? what does it bring to the user?

[none]	[12:01]	<ompaul>	jcz`, how did you get dapper?
[none]	[12:01]	<dooglus>	kbrooks: it means I can try ubuntu without affecting windows, and then install it if I like it, all from the same CD
[none]	[12:01]	<zcat[1] >	kbrooks: test your hardware before you install, prettyier installer, do other stuff while you wait..
[none]	[12:02]	<cef>	kbrooks: you can play with it, and install from it using a graphical interface
[none]	[12:02]	<dooglus>	kbrooks: previously I had to download 2 huge iso files - one to try, and one to install.
[none]	[12:02]	<thoreauputic>	kbrooks: more like what it brings to the shipit distribution method ( lower costs)
[none]	[12:02]	<Afief>	Can someone tell me where to get dapper from? the homepage still links to breezy
[none]	[12:02]	<jcz`>	i downloaded it off torrents if i recall correctly about 10 days ago

[none]	[12:02]	<kbrooks>	dooglus: now you have to get 1 iso file?

[none]	[12:02]	<dooglus>	kbrooks: right.
[none]	[12:02]	<thoreauputic>	kbrooks: built-in installer on the desktop/live CD
[positive]	[12:02]	<Terminus->	Oddie: alternate cd i think. :)
[none]	[12:02]	<dooglus>	kbrooks: the 'desktop' one is both live cd and install cd

[positive]	[12:03]	<ajmitch_>	zcat[1] : a shame I'm not downloading then :)
[none]	[12:03]	<kestas>	how come the server and desktop cds are seperate? server is just desktop minus some packages right?
[none]	[12:03]	<ompaul>	jcz`,  that is an indication that something is very wrong even my slowest machine is nothing like that
[none]	[12:03]	<derfbugzi>	bbrazil, cheers
[none]	[12:03]	<bbrazil>	kestas: kinda
[none]	[12:04]	<Linuturk>	server has a completely different kernel
[none]	[12:04]	<Linuturk>	it's optimized to run on a server

[none]	[12:04]	<ompaul>	jcz`, log in and tell me when your in
[none]	[12:04]	<siccness>	dooglus, so the 'desktop' is both desktop/live cd?
[none]	[12:04]	<kestas>	Linuturk: you'd think they'd just put a different deb on a single cd
[none]	[12:04]	<siccness>	and alternative is just desktop/install?

[none]	[12:07]	<ompaul>	jcz`, yeap
[none]	[12:07]	<jcz`>	ompaul, my dapper isnt online currently, does that matter ?
[none]	[12:07]	<ompaul>	jcz`, it needs to be
[none]	[12:07]	<dooglus>	ompaul: there are some here who claim that using sudo to run gui apps can mess things upo
[positive]	[12:07]	<zcat[1] >	I don't think I've had anything through dist-upgrade for most of the day so I'm probably running what's on the CD now anyhow :)
[none]	[12:07]	<Fillado>	ompaul: ya what?
[positive]	[12:08]	<ompaul>	dooglus, I am one of them :-) so noted Fillado your talking gui
[none]	[12:08]	<Flannel>	dooglus: that's correct.  use gksudo.
[none]	[12:08]	<ompaul>	Fillado your talking gui gksudo
[none]	[12:08]	<evad>	dooglus: how? sudo runs it as the root user - it works just fine and there cannot be (due to the way unix works) any bad side affects
[none]	[12:08]	<Fillado>	ya
[none]	[12:08]	<dooglus>	Flannel: do you have any example of how sudo can mess anything up?  like a repeatable case?
[none]	[12:08]	<jcz`>	ok, i have to switch cables, so i'll rejoin the channel using my linux box after i swap ethernet cables, be right back
[none]	[12:08]	<ompaul>	jcz`, let me give you instructions first
[positive]	[12:08]	<Flannel>	evad: it's bugs in the qt library
[none]	[12:09]	<Afief>	Isn't there a liveCD/Install CD of ubuntu anymore?
[none]	[12:09]	<jcz`>	ok
[positive]	[12:09]	<dooglus>	evad: I'm with you on this, yet people (like ompaul just did) continue to claim that sudo is a bad idea
[none]	[12:09]	<thoreauputic>	sudo can mess up ~/.ICEauthority on KDE, and .Xauthority
[positive]	[12:09]	<Fillado>	Afief: Yes, that's the desktop one :)
[none]	[12:09]	<khermans>	dooglus, if there is a bad bug -- it could possibly hose your system
[none]	[12:09]	<evad>	oh
[negative]	[12:09]	<apokryphos>	Afief: no, the setup has changed. There's an install+live CD (the desktop CD), and there's an old fashioned text install CD: the alternate CD
[none]	[12:09]	<slackern>	argh, so annoying that when you connect through places to a server that is down that it locks up almost everything till it times out.
[none]	[12:09]	<dooglus>	khermans: that's true of sudo and gksudo both
[none]	[12:09]	<jcz`>	ompaul, ok
[none]	[12:09]	<khermans>	dooglus, of course
[none]	[12:09]	<zcat[1] >	you can run gui stuff from the terminal as 'sudo foo', i don't think there's any major difference... if you already have a terminal open. For alt-F2 you'd use gksudo because it can ask for password through a window..
[none]	[12:09]	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: I've only seen sudo cause problems with KDE apps, personally
[none]	[12:09]	<evad>	I enable root on Ubuntu anyway, sudo passwd root really isn't difficult.

[none]	[12:10]	<khermans>	thoreauputic, kdelibs try to make sure you dont have setuid or setguid
[positive]	[12:10]	<keiron>	i see 6.06 has been released. when can i expect apt to get updated so i can do the update through there?
[none]	[12:10]	<Afief>	apokryphos: so.... if i want to install, i have to boot into ubuntu live first?
[none]	[12:10]	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: does it still?  I think that was fixed some time ago
[none]	[12:10]	<apokryphos>	Afief: correct
[none]	[12:10]	<Flannel>	!gksudo
[none]	[12:10]	<ubotu>	Use gksudo to run qt applications with root privileges. Using sudo to start gtk apps can scramble your user account permissions.

[positive]	[12:10]	<zcat[1] >	thanks Flannel I didn't know that :)
[none]	[12:10]	<dooglus>	thoreauputic: k3b used to cause problems

[none]	[12:13]	<Verithrax>	!botsnack
[none]	[12:13]	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: no
[positive]	[12:13]	<ubotu>	thanks verithrax :)
[none]	[12:13]	<Verithrax>	That's cute.

[none]	[12:14]	<Fillado>	^^Tubbie
[none]	[12:14]	<dxdemetriou>	apokryphos: I readed for this command is for beta packages. The Update Manager will not ask for upgrade to Dapper normally?
[none]	[12:14]	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: to upgrade to latest amaroK you have to /msg ubotu amarok
[none]	[12:14]	<cef>	hrm, 6.8gb downloaded from the torrent
[none]	[12:14]	<thoreauputic>	dxdemetriou: it should now
[none]	[12:14]	<dooglus>	apokryphos: are you saying it only happens with KDE apps?  I don't have any of those
[none]	[12:14]	<apokryphos>	dxdemetriou: follow the same method for upgrading from rc. /msg ubotu rc
[none]	[12:14]	<cef>	8.85 now.. moving fast!
[positive]	[12:14]	<apokryphos>	dooglus: well I'm a KDE user, so I only have experience with KDE :)
[none]	[12:14]	<Favorit>	hi there guys

[none]	[12:15]	<Favorit>	i got a well known maybe problem which i'm pondering how to solve.
[none]	[12:15]	<alexey__>	hi all !
[none]	[12:15]	<CrippsFX>	apokryphos, once the repo is added to /etc/apt/sources.list doing an apt-get update and apt-get upgrade amarok should do it.
[none]	[12:15]	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: the main repositories do not have the latest version of amarok
[none]	[12:15]	<Rambo3>	lucky i got my copies  of official dapper from chinese blackmarket , before it was  released
[none]	[12:15]	<apokryphos>	but if you /msg ubotu amarok you can ge tit
[none]	[12:15]	<apokryphos>	get it
[none]	[12:15]	<Favorit>	i compiled 2.6.16 on ubuntu 5.10, amd64, and device mapper complains about dm-linear Device lookup failed
[none]	[12:15]	<khermans>	Rambo3, yeah me too

[positive]	[12:15]	<bvanaerde>	grimboy: the bot is scared of me ;)
[none]	[12:15]	<dooglus>	apokryphos: yet you use gksudo?
[none]	[12:15]	<apokryphos>	CrippsFX: oh right; then you can just sudo apt-get install amarok, yes
[none]	[12:16]	<grimboy>	Heh
[none]	[12:16]	<apokryphos>	dooglus: no, I use kdesu. gksudo is the GTK-equivalent
[positive]	[12:16]	<CrippsFX>	apokryphos, yep. Ya just missed that part of the message in the lines above :)

[none]	[12:20]	<crimsun>	In the Twenty-frist Century, we dislike reading the topic before we ask questions. We'd much rather have PONIES.
[none]	[12:20]	<gnuyen>	hrmm
[none]	[12:20]	<negsoul>	ow many megs wll it take to upgrade to new dapper?

[none]	[12:21]	<gnuyen>	is the only way to use update manager to upgrade to dapper by running it -d?

[none]	[12:45]	<apokryphos>	halibut: nvidia: yes; 32-bit software: as a general: no, ubuntu/debian is not biarch
[none]	[12:45]	<halibut>	Is Gnome faster under 64bit?
[none]	[12:45]	<Cas>	!tell [zero]  about upgrade

[none]	[12:46]	<Lukketto>	stephane: did you copy it?
[none]	[12:46]	<hyphenated>	protocol1: Well, I generally come in about 15 minutes late, I use the side door.. (can't remember the rest)
[positive]	[12:46]	<kerb>	lol, just when I got a 25mbit server up to seed :)
[positive]	[12:46]	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: fair enough ;) But the alternate CD should work better on low-memory machines for standard installs too :)
[none]	[12:46]	<reiki>	ubuntu+1 is invite only? (I just woke up)
[none]	[12:47]	<kerb>	reiki: closed until edgy opens

[none]	[12:47]	<protocol1>	lol
[none]	[12:47]	<thoreauputic>	dooglus: I seem to recall seeing a discussion on ubuntu-devel list about problems with the desktop CD on low memory systems
[none]	[12:47]	<Frogzoo>	ThE-LiGhT: SHWEET!!
[none]	[12:47]	<petrik>	Just realised last CD I burned was on windoze. Now I have no more windoze this will be a test to see if breezy has CD writing set up correctly on this machine
[none]	[12:48]	<Corey>	woah
[none]	[12:48]	<hyphenated>	protocol1: last time I watched it, I laughed extra hard seeing Dr Cox (from Scrubs) as one of the Bob's

[none]	[12:48]	<ska-fan>	Which disk do I need when I want to upgrade from breezy and do have network access but want to take as much packages as possible from the disk?

[none]	[12:48]	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
[none]	[12:48]	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no Live session available on it.
[none]	[12:48]	<berrum>	Fillado, i dont know it is a mass storage device
[none]	[12:48]	<thoreauputic>	ska-fan: it has more packages on  it
[none]	[12:49]	<r4zz>	is the dvd worth waiting for?
[none]	[12:49]	<thoreauputic>	ska-fan: add it to synaptic or use apt-cdrom add
[none]	[12:49]	<ska-fan>	thoreauputic: ok. the old install cd is the new alternate cd?
[none]	[12:49]	<Spaceraver>	zjimbo... what would you need the dvd ver for... packages will become old fast
[none]	[12:49]	<dooglus>	r4zz: no

[none]	[12:50]	<protocol1>	hyphenated, hahah peter gets promoted for blowing off
[none]	[12:50]	<Healot>	if you need LVM/RAID support, low RAM, customization, take the alternate-CD
[none]	[12:50]	<Frogzoo>	Corey: you may need to change your repos - not sure

[none]	[01:35]	<dodgyvile>	I just upgraded to dapper and there a few problems! 1. The internet connection keeps dropping out. It runs fine for maybe 5 mins and then just drops out. After a little while it reconnects again. Even now I think it may have dropped out. D'Oh
[none]	[01:35]	<dyn>	Fillado: so you do not recommend the 6.06 livecd's built in resize solution?
[none]	[01:35]	<livingdaylight>	Ok, GUYS, THX. Today is a very important day!
[none]	[01:35]	<QPAD|warlock>	How do I run a application trough shell_exec and save the PID?
[none]	[01:35]	<pedrocr>	update-manager should have the dapper upgrade availabe as soon as my mirror updates, right?
[none]	[01:35]	<Frogzoo>	6 hours - 16 hours - 10 hours - it's like watching dials on a slot machine
[none]	[01:35]	<dooglus>	rukuartic: not with the final release though?
[none]	[01:35]	<zbyte>	3.5
[none]	[01:35]	<rukuartic>	dooglus: no it was a beta.
[positive]	[01:35]	<thoreauputic>	dodgyvile: yup, I didn't see your post saying that you had dropped out ;)
[none]	[01:35]	<Fillado>	well, i've never actually used it, i just use system rescue cd to resize the disk, then all i need to select is use the largest bit of free space
[none]	[01:35]	<dodgyvile>	All my connections (http, irc, bittorrent) just drop to zero

[none]	[01:37]	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: you'll probably find it's quicker to download the .iso, mount the image, and add the mountpoint as a repository, then update...
[none]	[01:37]	<jadaz87>	Dapper add 300 proplr
[none]	[01:37]	<dodgyvile>	When I first upgraded to dapper, the network icon in the top tray appeared to be a broken wireless connection (this comp's never had wireless) as opposed to a normal ADSL connection that was there before...

[none]	[01:38]	<livingdaylight>	was that off today?
[none]	[01:38]	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: but even now, it's worth switching to the torrent

[none]	[01:56]	<hypnox>	pedrocr just change your sources.list and go ahead and apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[01:56]	<Frogzoo>	!torrent
[negative]	[01:56]	<ubotu>	The 'official' Dapper torrent can be found at http://www.snurl.com/dapper
[none]	[01:56]	<pedrocr>	kimo: it has some text mode instructions
[none]	[01:56]	<pedrocr>	kimo: although they state you should install ubuntu-desktop which seems odd
[negative]	[01:56]	<rohan>	someone needs to update - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
[none]	[01:56]	<viola>	hi. does anyone know if the 6.06 desktop cd can be used to update breezy? or should i get the server one?
[none]	[01:56]	<tarzeau>	anyone got an idea how to tell update-grub to put lock entries to all menu entries but the first or the default?
[positive]	[01:57]	<rohan>	tarzeau: did you do !popcon :)
[none]	[01:57]	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, so you get any new packages.
[none]	[01:57]	<tarzeau>	!popcon
[none]	[01:57]	<ubotu>	"rumour has it, popcon is popularity contest, a package which is installed by default on all ubuntu machines, but aint configured, and therefore not ""running"". Type this in a terminal to contribute: sudo dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest"
[none]	[01:57]	<dooglus>	Frogzoo: that's the official 386 desktop torrent only.
[none]	[01:57]	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: but I don't want a desktop, it's a server
[none]	[01:57]	<Seveas>	viola, you need the alternate for that
[none]	[01:57]	<makelele>	is this the correct link to go to in order to upgrade to Dapper
[negative]	[01:57]	<makelele>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
[none]	[01:57]	<tarzeau>	rohan: wrong channel, man!
[positive]	[01:57]	<rohan>	tarzeau: i know, i just wanted to poke you nevertheless ;)
[none]	[01:57]	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, install the appropriate virtual package for that, then.
[none]	[01:57]	<noodle>	what's the difference between emacs and emacs21?
[none]	[01:58]	<Fujitsu>	ubuntu-server, or something.
[none]	[01:58]	<tuxtheslacker>	wow, snurl must be getting hammered....
[none]	[01:58]	<pedrocr>	"Fujitsu: it should be installed, it's a standard ""server"" ubuntu install"
[none]	[01:58]	<dooglus>	noodle: emacs is a metapackage which depends on emacs21
[none]	[01:58]	<thoreauputic>	noodle: the number 21 is on the end of one of them ? *g*
[none]	[01:58]	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: my question was how to upgrade those
[none]	[01:58]	<tuxtheslacker>	does anyone have a non-official download they can verify iit works?
[none]	[01:58]	<viola>	"Seveas, thanks. i'm having trouble with update-manager, it gives me a ""could not calculate the upgrade"" error. doi you think i might have the same error with the alternate version?"
[none]	[01:58]	<Chobo-Mog>	hmm...I go to sleep and there's ~850 people in here.  I guess being at 1020+ is a good sign ^___^
[none]	[01:58]	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, your best bet is to probably modify sources.list and dist-upgrade...
[none]	[01:58]	<noodle>	dooglus: ok i can install emacs-nox or emacs21-nox which 1 do i want?
[positive]	[01:59]	<Fujitsu>	Chobo-Mog, certainly :)
[none]	[01:59]	<dooglus>	noodle: you want it without X?
[none]	[01:59]	<noodle>	dooglus: yea
[none]	[01:59]	<pm>	one more quetsion, i'm using dapper beta, should i upgrade via apt-get upgrade or is it advisiable to install the final release anew?
[positive]	[01:59]	<dooglus>	noodle: what you really want is my home-made package of the latest emacs21 from CVS :)
[none]	[01:59]	<Fujitsu>	pm, apt-get dist-upgrade.
[none]	[01:59]	<jdmpike>	after upgrade, is anyone having freenx problems?
[none]	[01:59]	<pedrocr>	Fujitsu: yes, and I've done this with debian and knew how to do it. I just find it strange that there's no process for upgrading server installations
[none]	[01:59]	<rixth>	What is the md5 of the desktop iso?
[none]	[01:59]	<rixth>	i386
[none]	[01:59]	<dooglus>	noodle: there hasn't been an emacs release for a few years
[none]	[01:59]	<Fujitsu>	pedrocr, a number of people have noted this.
[none]	[01:59]	<grimboy>	Wow, I had a useless temp file that was taking up 5GB of space and filling up the hard disk
[none]	[02:00]	<noodle>	dooglus: lol just answer me pls -_- what's the difference between the two
[none]	[02:00]	<tuxtheslacker>	is there a way to upgrade with the CDs?
[none]	[02:00]	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: sound issues after using freenx here, yes
[none]	[02:00]	<Fujitsu>	tuxtheslacker, only with the alternate or server CD.
[negative]	[02:00]	<makelele>	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades - this link still says that this is beta software - could this be that this page has just not ben updated as yet ?
[none]	[02:00]	<dooglus>	noodle: there is no difference.  emacs is an empty package which pulls in emacs21.
[none]	[02:00]	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: set the CD as the source
[none]	[02:00]	<Fujitsu>	makelele, it just hasn't been updated.
[positive]	[02:00]	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: I assume the package from breezy doesn't quite fit dapper :)
[none]	[02:00]	<rohan>	makelele: yes, the page is not updated
[none]	[02:00]	<pm>	Fujitsu: are you sure there won't be any problems if i upgrade this way?
[none]	[02:00]	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: them distupgrade
[none]	[02:00]	<jdmpike>	thoreauputic, I can't log in remotely - any ideas?
[none]	[02:00]	<dooglus>	noodle: some day it will pull in emacs22 instead
[none]	[02:00]	<thoreauputic>	jdmpike: ah, that I haven't struck
[none]	[02:00]	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: Ill be doing this myself once the download finishes
[none]	[02:00]	<scheuri>	noodle: aptitude show emacs-nox AND aptitude show emacs21-nox
[positive]	[02:01]	<Fastly>	anyone else here experience problems with NetworkManager after internet upgrade from breezy to dapper?
[none]	[02:01]	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, where's the sources disk?
[none]	[02:01]	<makelele>	rohan: so it is safe to perform those steps on that page to upgrade to the released version of Dapper ?

[none]	[02:06]	<capitanplaneta>	ok
[none]	[02:07]	<rohan>	Sampizcat: server wont give x and gnome like alternate
[none]	[02:07]	<grimboy>	Sampizcat, The server has demons useful for serbing
[none]	[02:07]	<tuxtheslacker>	sudo dpkg -r picasa still leaves remnants because apt-get install picasa breaks.

[none]	[02:07]	<capitanplaneta>	I guess I should remove the extra repositories automatix introduced on my list before upgrading
[none]	[02:07]	<grimboy>	Sampizcat, Like lamp straight out of the box, (even thought php sucks and mysql isn't ACID complient)

[positive]	[02:07]	<rohan>	alternate is ROCKING, cos it has gcc, unlike the desktop cd :P
[none]	[02:07]	<monk_>	hi, i have a problem with hotkeys for my acer travelmate laptop, on FN+F5 it crashes (using ubuntu 6.06 LTS)
[none]	[02:08]	<tuxtheslacker>	Package picasa is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[none]	[02:08]	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: how does it break? did you get rid of config files too?
[none]	[02:08]	<tuxtheslacker>	what does that mean?
[none]	[02:08]	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, I did a purge.
[none]	[02:08]	<tuxtheslacker>	a remove and then a purge.
[none]	[02:08]	<Sampizcat>	Ah smeg. Stupid program, I think it's broken.
[none]	[02:08]	<Fujitsu>	capitanplaneta, automatix may cause issues with an upgrade.
[none]	[02:08]	<rackerz>	Anybody know why the Ubuntu forums are so slow?
[none]	[02:08]	<kestas>	rackerz: think about it
[none]	[02:08]	<wheelswitch>	rackerz, because they are getting hammerd
[none]	[02:08]	<surface>	rohan: i tot alternate is used for upgrade
[none]	[02:08]	<Frogzoo>	rackerz: I'm guessing same servers as the repos probly
[none]	[02:08]	<capitanplaneta>	Fujitsu: thx, I'll remove automatix first, then
[none]	[02:09]	<Fujitsu>	surface, it can be.
[none]	[02:09]	<rohan>	surface: yes, it is
[none]	[02:09]	<tuxtheslacker>	kestas, if you want, I can send you the strace?

[none]	[02:09]	<rackerz>	Total Guests: 1182
[none]	[02:09]	<Fujitsu>	capitanplaneta, it will likely cause issues even after removal.
[none]	[02:09]	<rohan>	because the desktop cd doesnt have .deb's unlike the alternate one
[none]	[02:09]	<kestas>	tuxtheslacker: I wouldnt know what to do with it, Im not sure what the prob is
[positive]	[02:09]	<tiCo89>	thank you for the new release :-)

[none]	[02:09]	<rohan>	Exter-C: yes
[none]	[02:09]	<capitanplaneta>	I will clean up my repositories list

[none]	[02:09]	<Sampizcat>	rackerz:  The desktop CD is like a live cd
[none]	[02:09]	<thoreauputic>	!alternate
[none]	[02:09]	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD is the classical Ubuntu text-installer, with no Live session available on it.
[none]	[02:10]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, it's not recommended.
[none]	[02:10]	<livingdaylight>	seveas: i'm so excited man!
[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	why isn't it recommended?
[none]	[02:10]	<rohan>	livingdaylight: did you start the update ?
[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	I did, is there any difference?
[none]	[02:10]	<Fujitsu>	As it's generally old/really new (pre-stable).
[none]	[02:10]	<livingdaylight>	rohan: YeS! i'm so excited!
[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	it's not..
[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	the real one?
[none]	[02:10]	<Fujitsu>	Although, if you get the right one, it's OK.
[none]	[02:10]	<surface>	thx ubotu
[positive]	[02:10]	<pseudodeadkitty>	It's ready. It's off to install Dapper on a clean partition- wish me luck. :)
[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	DAMN, then i have to reinstall AGAIN
[none]	[02:10]	<Fujitsu>	Why?
[none]	[02:10]	<rohan>	robinl1: why ?
[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	well, i installed ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso

[none]	[02:10]	<robinl1>	pool*
[none]	[02:10]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, when did you get the image?
[none]	[02:10]	<scheuri>	robinl1: NO, you dont!!
[none]	[02:11]	<Fujitsu>	There have been a couple of versions.
[none]	[02:11]	<robinl1>	Today.
[none]	[02:11]	<tuxtheslacker>	mmap2(0xfa5f0000, 131072, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0) = 0x7bee0000
[none]	[02:11]	<tuxtheslacker>	munmap(0x7bee0000, 131072)              = 0
[none]	[02:11]	<tuxtheslacker>	
[none]	[02:11]	<Seveas>	robinl1, so? then you simply upgrade...
[none]	[02:11]	<Sampizcat>	Does Alternative have extra RAID features of server?
[none]	[02:11]	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, just wait till you run out of disk space and half of the install fails.
[none]	[02:11]	<tuxtheslacker>	anyone know how i would go about fixing that?
[none]	[02:11]	<Chobo-Mog>	lol so many files on the BT tracker
[none]	[02:11]	<surface>	emmm that means desktop version have GUI installation
[negative]	[02:11]	<pettman>	it is 4 hours before I even can start installing :(
[none]	[02:11]	<sybariten>	is there a package called locales ?

[none]	[02:11]	<robinl1>	Seveas: How to upgrade with the old version of Ubuntu dapper drake running and without going to Edgy?
[none]	[02:11]	<Exter-C>	I noticed some time ago that Ubuntu has been 'certified' for DB2. We currently use Redhat for anything that requires commercial software, however we much prefer debian, With dapper now being out and having a longer support cycles for the server distrib I am interested to know if a) there are any intensions for Ubuntu to become certified for Oracl, and B) if there is any roadmap paln to have support or certification for commercial backup products like Verit
[none]	[02:11]	<ubotu>	locales: (GNU C Library: National Language (locale) data [support] ), section base, is important. Version: 2.3.5-1ubuntu12.5.10.1 (breezy), Packaged size: 3963 kB, Installed size: 10584 kB
[positive]	[02:11]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy: hey, don't say that!  :D
[none]	[02:11]	<surface>	did anyone here tried desktop installer? do it have package selection options?
[none]	[02:11]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, just sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.
[none]	[02:11]	<Chobo-Mog>	"regular desktop users without 64 bit procs should use the ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso torrent right""?"
[none]	[02:11]	<Fujitsu>	surface, no.
[none]	[02:12]	<Fujitsu>	surface, no package options.
[none]	[02:12]	<Fujitsu>	Chobo-Mog, yes.
[none]	[02:12]	<Frogzoo>	seems there are no DVD torrents?
[none]	[02:12]	<Chobo-Mog>	excellent, ty
[positive]	[02:12]	<Dimitris>	Well this is confusing! :-D I just repartition my hd for a fresh install. What do i download Desktop or Alternate? I don't want ending up with a live cd!
[none]	[02:12]	<viola>	"does anyone know how to ""uninstall"" changes made by automatix?"
[none]	[02:12]	<SunTzuTech>	Frogzoo: noticed the same
[none]	[02:12]	<Fujitsu>	Dimitris, Desktop will do.
[none]	[02:12]	<robinl1>	It says there are no updates.
[none]	[02:12]	<Chobo-Mog>	dvd torrents were there I think
[none]	[02:12]	<wheelswitch>	Frogzoo, there are dvd torrents
[none]	[02:12]	<Chousuke>	Dimitris: desktop
[none]	[02:12]	<Fujitsu>	viola, it's very difficult.
[none]	[02:12]	<surface>	Fujitsu: i think server version might be have...
[none]	[02:12]	<Dimitris>	thnx
[none]	[02:12]	<robinl1>	Dimitris: ALTERNATE
[none]	[02:12]	<robinl1>	ALTERNATE!!
[none]	[02:12]	<robinl1>	Desktop is the live CD
[negative]	[02:12]	<Chousuke>	:(
[positive]	[02:12]	<Fujitsu>	surface, the expert thing does.
[none]	[02:12]	<grimboy>	Exter-C, get in contact with a support sales representative if your a suit.
[none]	[02:12]	<Chousuke>	robinl1: um
[none]	[02:12]	<viola>	fujitsu, will it ruin the upgrade process even if i get the alternate cd?
[positive]	[02:13]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; be an optimist  :D
[none]	[02:13]	<thoreauputic>	Dimitris: desktop has an installer and live CD in one
[none]	[02:13]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, the Desktop thing caxn install!
[none]	[02:13]	<Seveas>	robinl1, so?
[none]	[02:13]	<Chousuke>	robinl1: the live CD and the installer have been unified.
[none]	[02:13]	<robinl1>	true..
[none]	[02:13]	<Fujitsu>	viola, it /may/.

[none]	[02:13]	<Frogzoo>	wheelswitch: url?
[none]	[02:13]	<monk_>	anyone can help me with hotkeys?
[negative]	[02:13]	<wheelswitch>	Frogzoo, http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/dapper/release/dvd/
[none]	[02:13]	<Seveas>	installed system is installed system....
[none]	[02:13]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; love your Ubuntu
[positive]	[02:13]	<Fujitsu>	monk_, explain your problem.
[none]	[02:13]	<Frogzoo>	wheelswitch: thx mate
[none]	[02:13]	<Exter-C>	grimboy: i am not a suit, but I would love to remove redhat from our internal servers.
[none]	[02:13]	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, yeh, sorry that's just what happend to me, cause I only had like 500mb left
[none]	[02:13]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; hehe
[none]	[02:13]	<surface>	wheelswitch: dvd have all alternate ,desktop and server ?
[none]	[02:13]	<kevor>	wow, ubuntu.com is totally loaded
[none]	[02:13]	<robinl1>	Seveas, is there any difference between downloading Dapper today at 06:00 at the Netherlandish timezone, on the pool?
[none]	[02:13]	<wheelswitch>	Frogzoo, only 2 seeds at the moment, but give it an hour or 10 and that should be change
[none]	[02:13]	<Krank>	Is the DVD release a Live install one?
[none]	[02:13]	<wheelswitch>	surface, yes, as far as i know
[none]	[02:13]	<Sampizcat>	mmm. I don't think this installer is going anywhere...
[none]	[02:13]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; how big is your harddrive?
[negative]	[02:14]	<Chobo-Mog>	DVD Torrents --->  http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/  The torrent's name is ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso   and it's 3.13gb for i386 users
[none]	[02:14]	<monk_>	Fujitsu, i'm usind ubuntu 6.06 on acer travelmate 2354 and when i try FN+F5 (vga output) it freezes
[none]	[02:14]	<Exter-C>	grimboy: however to do so its one of those chicken and egg situations, to remove redhat we need to know the distribution is certified by the vendors otherwise management will most likely laugh at the proposals
[none]	[02:14]	<scheuri>	robinl1: if you update it there isnt...dont worry
[none]	[02:14]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; what do you mean you only had 500mb left?
[none]	[02:14]	<monk_>	same problem with ubuntu 5.10
[none]	[02:14]	<Fujitsu>	monk_, that's not a hotkey issue.
[negative]	[02:14]	<threat>	50Kb from the xubuntu site :(
[none]	[02:14]	<fiendskull9>	so is this now a drake channel too?
[none]	[02:14]	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, 10GB but I have an external 250GB one.
[none]	[02:14]	<Fujitsu>	That'll be a graphics driver issue.
[none]	[02:14]	<Seveas>	robinl1, the .pool were testing cd's
[none]	[02:14]	<threat>	where can I find some more mirrors?
[none]	[02:14]	<Fujitsu>	fiendskull9, Dapper has been released, so yes.
[positive]	[02:14]	<Sampizcat>	threat:  mirrors are you friend :)
[none]	[02:14]	<Seveas>	they may have been broken
[none]	[02:14]	<robinl1>	yes and #ubuntu+1 is about edgy
[none]	[02:14]	<monk_>	Fujitsu, what can I do?
[none]	[02:14]	<Frogzoo>	wheelswitch: I'm assuming these have all the packages so are good to upgrade from?
[none]	[02:14]	<robinl1>	Seveas: so this is not the right one?
[none]	[02:14]	<fiendskull9>	grimboy, why dont you make the 250 internal, and 10 ext.?
[positive]	[02:14]	<Fujitsu>	monk_, I have no experience with Acer laptops.
[none]	[02:14]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; 250!  '<  should be enough?
[none]	[02:14]	<grimboy>	Exter-C, Just put together a slideshow, they love those.
[none]	[02:15]	<pm>	what time did the isos appear on the servers? (it's 14.15 right now for me)
[none]	[02:15]	<Seveas>	robinl1, if it installed then it's ok
[none]	[02:15]	<surface>	look forward to fubuntu haha
[none]	[02:15]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, just apt-get dist-upgrade.
[none]	[02:15]	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  I have an acer laptop, and I find that most linux distros don't work with the hotkeys
[none]	[02:15]	<fiendskull9>	will dist-upgrade give me a stable dapper system then?
[none]	[02:15]	<sybariten>	but is locales something related specifically to ubuntu?  oh why o why cant there just be a single simple keyboard setting that would affect X as well as the console???!
[none]	[02:15]	<grimboy>	livingdaylight, That's mounted at /music
[none]	[02:15]	<robinl1>	Seveas: it DID install.. but is there any difference?
[none]	[02:15]	<Fujitsu>	3 hours ago, pm.
[none]	[02:15]	<hypnox>	DapperUpgrades much improved hopefully
[none]	[02:15]	<sybariten>	and for all linuxes
[none]	[02:15]	<surface>	anyway i turn my ubuntu to fluxbox version
[none]	[02:15]	<waym>	when did it come out? a few hours ago?
[none]	[02:15]	<monk_>	Sampizcat, other hotkeys work fine, just this one does not
[none]	[02:15]	<grimboy>	fiendskull9, Cause I'm stupid
[none]	[02:15]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, not if you dist-upgrade.
[none]	[02:15]	<capitanplaneta>	what's different on the dapper DVD from the CD? what else does it contain?
[none]	[02:15]	<rixth>	Haha, I am on IRC while installing woo!
[none]	[02:15]	<wheelswitch>	waym, yeah, about 3 hours now i think
[none]	[02:15]	<Seveas>	robinl1, yes there is difference, but that's why you do apt-get upgrade
[positive]	[02:15]	<pm>	Fujitsu: thanks for reply :)
[none]	[02:15]	<spikeb>	woo
[none]	[02:15]	<rixth>	24%.
[none]	[02:15]	<waym>	thank you!
[none]	[02:15]	<robinl1>	Fujitsu: after i installed this thing, i updated, no updates.
[none]	[02:15]	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  maybe issues with the video out?
[none]	[02:15]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1 it's OK then.
[none]	[02:16]	<robinl1>	And now i tried updating too, now updates
[none]	[02:16]	<fiendskull9>	ill dist-upgrade while im at band practice later
[none]	[02:16]	<scheuri>	robinl1: that means that you have the same ubuntu as we all have
[none]	[02:16]	<robinl1>	no*
[none]	[02:16]	<robinl1>	ok
[none]	[02:16]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, did you apt-get update, then apt-get dist-upgrade?
[none]	[02:16]	<robinl1>	yes\
[none]	[02:16]	<Sampizcat>	"Grr, my installer is stuck on ""Installing GRUB boot loader"", 50%, been there for about 20 mins"
[positive]	[02:16]	<fiendskull9>	i had a test flight running a few days ago, but got tired of 15 updates every 5 minutes :P
[none]	[02:16]	<Fujitsu>	OK, that's fine then.
[none]	[02:16]	<rixth>	I am suprised that the install CD does not come with xChat.... I freuently booted into my 5.04 live disc and used xChat when dapper wouldn't start.
[none]	[02:16]	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, what hardware?
[none]	[02:16]	<robinl1>	rixth: i think Gaim replaces it.
[none]	[02:16]	<Fujitsu>	rixth, Gaim is an IRC client.
[none]	[02:16]	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, check md5
[none]	[02:16]	<robinl1>	...
[none]	[02:16]	<spikeb>	rixth, yeah, the earlier releases came with it
[positive]	[02:16]	<MistaED>	i'm not sure if i should list this as a bug: i tried the expresso installer with dapper RC and used the partitioner (56gb NTFS + 4gb FAT32) and removed the fat32, shrunk the 56gb to 12gb (sda1), added 8gb ext3 (sda2 for /), 512mb swap (sda3), the rest ext3 (sda4), it took awhile to shrink but it worked, but then the next window to set mount points didn't show sda2 at all
[none]	[02:16]	<monk_>	Sampizcat, i don't know. everything runs very well, just when i press FN+F5...
[none]	[02:16]	<bimberi>	rixth: gaim can handle irc and cd space is at a premium
[none]	[02:16]	<grimboy>	robinl1, Have you tried -d
[none]	[02:17]	<robinl1>	grimboy: no! i don't want edgy!
[none]	[02:17]	<waym>	ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso              <<< 3.3 gigs, what's in this?
[none]	[02:17]	<rixth>	robin, Fujitsu that is what I am using right now.
[none]	[02:17]	<tahorg>	waym: dvd image
[none]	[02:17]	<robinl1>	me too.
[none]	[02:17]	<Fujitsu>	MistaED, if it's being silly it is probably a bug.
[positive]	[02:17]	<MistaED>	the fix i did was just formatting sda2-4 manually, then expresso was all good
[positive]	[02:17]	<scheuri>	waym: everything...:)
[none]	[02:17]	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  MB-Asus P5WD2-E Premium, Intel D940, 4x512MB Corsair DDR2 667Mhz, 4x300GB Seagate SATA2, DVD Burner
[none]	[02:17]	<robinl1>	the gaim IRC client kind of owns
[none]	[02:17]	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  what happens exactly?
[none]	[02:17]	<Fujitsu>	Hmm..
[none]	[02:17]	<Fujitsu>	SATA2 may be a bit of an issue.
[none]	[02:17]	<robinl1>	Seveas, are there any speed optimizers in the official release?
[none]	[02:17]	<tahorg>	waym: it looks like full repository
[none]	[02:17]	<rixth>	robin1, you being sarcastic?
[negative]	[02:17]	<MistaED>	i can't test it now with full dapper =/
[none]	[02:17]	<robinl1>	cuz this Dapper is a bit slow.
[none]	[02:17]	<grimboy>	robinl1: But you can update from edgy to official in a couple of hours or so.
[none]	[02:17]	<waym>	 yummy
[none]	[02:17]	<robinl1>	No, rixth, i aren't.
[none]	[02:18]	<Seveas>	"""speed optimizers""?"
[none]	[02:18]	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  Jeez, are you serious?
[none]	[02:18]	<wheelswitch>	waym, the dvd is the bling
[none]	[02:18]	<monk_>	Sampizcat, when i try to enable vga output, to use a video projector, the system freezes
[none]	[02:18]	<robinl1>	yes, the beta Dapper was fast, but this thing is a bit slower
[none]	[02:18]	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, it may have some issues.
[positive]	[02:18]	<rixth>	I think it is rather simplistic, then again, eac to his own =)
[none]	[02:18]	<Fujitsu>	robinl1, I doubt it.
[none]	[02:18]	<rambo3>	so there where no updates since yesterday on default u-dapper since yesterday
[none]	[02:18]	<Seveas>	robinl1, then you may need to reinstal with the official cd
[none]	[02:18]	<robinl1>	i think it's the videocard..
[positive]	[02:18]	<robinl1>	xD
[none]	[02:18]	<apokryphos>	rambo3: that's correct
[none]	[02:18]	<robinl1>	Is that really needed? luckily, i back-upped EVERYTHING
[none]	[02:18]	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  damnit. I wanted ubuntu because I thought it was going to work with Sata2, be up to date enough.
[none]	[02:18]	<robinl1>	So.. There i go again. Wish me luck, then
[none]	[02:18]	<eXistenZ>	the only way to install ubuntu is through the live cd?
[none]	[02:18]	<robinl1>	I'll just do it to be sure
[none]	[02:18]	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, it probably will.
[none]	[02:18]	<Sampizcat>	Fujitsu:  I'll check the MD5 like wheelswitch suggested.
[none]	[02:18]	<Fujitsu>	eXistenZ, no!
[none]	[02:18]	<grimboy>	robinl1, Good luck.
[none]	[02:19]	<rixth>	Good luck robin1!
[none]	[02:19]	<Fujitsu>	Sampizcat, that's your best bet.
[none]	[02:19]	<robinl1>	Thanks, grimvoy
[none]	[02:19]	<robinl1>	boy*
[none]	[02:19]	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: no, there is alternate cd too
[negative]	[02:19]	<eXistenZ>	=/
[positive]	[02:19]	<Krank>	Using the Flight 5 LiveCD I was never able to get to the desktop. I always got a series of these: hdc: ide_intr: huh? expected NULL handler on exit
[none]	[02:19]	<Krank>	Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 314976. Any idea what this means?
[none]	[02:19]	<Fujitsu>	Krank, a dud CD.
[negative]	[02:19]	<eXistenZ>	apokryphos, I downloaded http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso
[none]	[02:19]	<rixth>	I want to take the install CD to school and boot it. My idjit IT teacher will throw a tantrum.
[none]	[02:19]	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  were you able to use it with previous ubuntu versions?
[none]	[02:19]	<shriphani>	guys the upgrade is 579 Mb
[none]	[02:19]	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: that's the live+install
[positive]	[02:19]	<Fujitsu>	rixth, take a Desktop CD :)
[none]	[02:19]	<grimboy>	Krank, Download another then check the checksum
[none]	[02:19]	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, not necessarily.
[none]	[02:19]	<shriphani>	but it is too big a download for me
[none]	[02:20]	<Sampizcat>	monk_:  what laptop do you have? model?
[none]	[02:20]	<Krank>	Ah. Just make sure the MD5's match on the burn
[none]	[02:20]	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, wait for CDs, then.
[positive]	[02:20]	<rixth>	Fujitsu: that's what I have =) I wouldn't actually install it of course.
[none]	[02:20]	<monk_>	Sampizcat, it had the same problem on 5.10 too
[none]	[02:20]	<rambo3>	Krank, use latest cd. i hade same problems on reboot and shutdown
[none]	[02:20]	<Fujitsu>	rixth, why not?
[none]	[02:20]	<shriphani>	so can i upgrade from the cd ?
[none]	[02:20]	<monk_>	Sampizcat, it is a Acer TravelMate 2354LCi
[none]	[02:20]	<Sampizcat>	"wheelswitch:    ""Check CD for defects""?"
[none]	[02:20]	<capitanplaneta>	ubuntu dvd is just the install cd + live cd on one disk?
[none]	[02:20]	<livingdaylight>	if Dapper was a football team it would win the World Cup
[positive]	[02:20]	<Fujitsu>	I wouldn't mind if students at the school where I am an admin installed it :P
[none]	[02:20]	<Fujitsu>	livingdaylight, you don't say...
[none]	[02:20]	<capitanplaneta>	or does it contain extra stuff?
[none]	[02:20]	<spikeb>	capitanplaneta, and it has both amd64 and x86 i think
[none]	[02:20]	<rixth>	Fujitsu: I'd probably get suspended. They have this weird domain system going on too so I woukdn't be able to get online
[none]	[02:20]	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, Sorry?
[none]	[02:20]	<livingdaylight>	if Dapper was a rock band it would ROCK
[none]	[02:20]	<shriphani>	Fujitsu, can i upgrade from the dapper cd
[none]	[02:20]	<eXistenZ>	apokryphos, are they the same?
[none]	[02:20]	<alleyoopster>	Can anyone tell me if there has been updates between RC and final? I am was running RC and have not seen updates yet?
[none]	[02:21]	<capitanplaneta>	ok then the cd is enough for me
[none]	[02:21]	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, hmm.
[none]	[02:21]	<Fujitsu>	Actually.
[none]	[02:21]	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:  Is that the option I should use ?
[none]	[02:21]	<Krank>	Cool. Bit of a noob, but is dual-booting handled well?
[none]	[02:21]	<Fujitsu>	This is a significant issue...
[none]	[02:21]	<livingdaylight>	Fujitsu; man where is the poetry in ode to Dapper?
[none]	[02:21]	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:  to check md5? or something else?
[none]	[02:21]	<grimboy>	Krank, Yes.
[none]	[02:21]	<apokryphos>	eXistenZ: /msg ubotu desktop ; /msg ubotu alternate
[none]	[02:21]	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, yeah, that will do the same as an md5
[none]	[02:21]	<robinl1>	Seveas: What was wrong with the test CD's, then?
[none]	[02:21]	<Seveas>	robinl1, various issues
[none]	[02:21]	<livingdaylight>	GUYS! is there a poetry corner in ode to Dapper?
[none]	[02:21]	<shriphani>	because update manager says 518 MB but i have a download limit
[none]	[02:21]	<Fujitsu>	How are people going to upgrade if they haven't got the capacity to download things?
[none]	[02:21]	<robinl1>	For example?
[none]	[02:21]	<Fujitsu>	As you can't upgrade from the Desktop CD, and that's all that's being shipped...
[none]	[02:22]	<Dreamglider>	44minutes to go
[none]	[02:22]	<shriphani>	awwwwww
[none]	[02:22]	<shriphani>	sheesh
[none]	[02:22]	<Krank>	Any reason to go with the amd64 release over the i386?
[none]	[02:22]	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: I agree, it's an issue
[none]	[02:22]	<rixth>	Krank: if you have an amd64 platform?
[none]	[02:22]	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, I'd say that it was a huge issue!
[none]	[02:22]	<rixth>	Krank: no Flash or Java though
[none]	[02:22]	<shriphani>	so an upgrade is not possible from the cd ?
[none]	[02:22]	<scheuri>	Krank: if you want 64bit sofware on a 64bit processor
[none]	[02:22]	<defunkt>	krank: if you don't have the correct platform, it won't work.
[none]	[02:22]	<Fujitsu>	Seveas, what do you think>?
[none]	[02:22]	<apokryphos>	shriphani: from the altnernate CD it is, yes.
[none]	[02:22]	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: especially forpeople in countries without much broadband access
[none]	[02:22]	<shriphani>	alternate cd ?
[positive]	[02:22]	<Frogzoo>	omgawd - 70k with only 2 seeds on the DVD torrent :D
[none]	[02:22]	<defunkt>	the dapper install is so sexy <3
[none]	[02:22]	<shriphani>	tell me apokryphos
[none]	[02:23]	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, this is certainly going to be a large issue.
[none]	[02:23]	<robinl1>	Seveas: what issues?
[none]	[02:23]	<apokryphos>	shriphani: tell you what?
[none]	[02:23]	<Krank>	I've got it, presuming it works with ULI 1695 board

[none]	[02:23]	<ukh>	rixth: no flash, but java is there
[none]	[02:23]	<Fujitsu>	If it's an AMD Athlon 64, it'll work, Krank.
[none]	[02:23]	<Adam->	Alex takes big cock up his ass!

[none]	[02:23]	<Krank>	Cool
[none]	[02:23]	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: Personally I think shipit should have a choice of CDs
[none]	[02:23]	<defunkt>	howdy
[positive]	[02:23]	<Sampizcat>	wheelswitch:  crumbs, the CD is valid :P
[none]	[02:23]	<shriphani>	so i can do it with the text installer ?
[none]	[02:23]	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, it'd need to...
[none]	[02:23]	<Tinned_Tuna>	how do I perform an upgrade through apt?
[none]	[02:24]	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, that's how you /have/ to do it.
[none]	[02:24]	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: i.e. you can order alternate instead of desktop...
[none]	[02:24]	<rixth>	Oh! New Rhythmbox, awesome. The best feature they ever added was built in Last.fm support. And the Queued Songs sidebar was cool too.
[none]	[02:24]	<apokryphos>	ack, wrong person
[none]	[02:24]	<wheelswitch>	Sampizcat, weird.
[none]	[02:24]	<shriphani>	ok Fujitsu is it being shipped ?
[none]	[02:24]	<Fujitsu>	Tinned_Tuna, modify your sources.list, then apt-get update, then apt-get dist-upgrade.
[none]	[02:24]	<apokryphos>	hm, left
[none]	[02:24]	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, not at the moment.
[none]	[02:24]	<Tinned_Tuna>	hmm ok
[none]	[02:24]	<thoreauputic>	Fujitsu: I have a feeling this will come up on the mailing lists in the next few days
[none]	[02:24]	<Fujitsu>	However, this issue needs to be brought up with somebody important.
[none]	[02:24]	<Fujitsu>	thoreauputic, it'd better.

[none]	[02:26]	<fredrich1>	Fujitsu, yes and no...ive seen game forum servers go down from releases, but it's the first time i've seen a linux distro forum almost go down from the load
[positive]	[02:26]	<Fujitsu>	I don't have Nvidia experience.
[none]	[02:26]	<shriphani>	or carry out the download after a few boots ?
[none]	[02:26]	<Fujitsu>	fredrich1, Ubuntu forums are very good...
[none]	[02:27]	<goteki>	hmm
[none]	[02:27]	<shriphani>	man this has left me depressed
[none]	[02:27]	<Fujitsu>	*not very good.
[none]	[02:27]	<livingdaylight>	i can feel the Ubuntu-mexian wave coming on!
[none]	[02:27]	<fredrich1>	Fujitsu, what i mean is, that the rush and the pressure is more than a linux distro upgrade usually garners
[none]	[02:27]	<sybariten>	can someone make an educated guess on when the forums will be back to a normal state?
[none]	[02:27]	<Fujitsu>	fredrich1, yes. This /is/ Dapper.
[none]	[02:27]	<sybariten>	or is this all due to overpopulation only
[none]	[02:27]	<Fujitsu>	sybariten, once everybody gives up...
[none]	[02:27]	<Spaceraver>	a fujitus siemens amilo model m52174 should run ubuntu good right??
[none]	[02:27]	<Verithrax>	Too many 'omg lols dapper is the roxx0r posts'?
[none]	[02:27]	<Fujitsu>	sybariten, probably just overpopulation.
[none]	[02:27]	<thoreauputic>	sybariten: the latter I think
[negative]	[02:28]	<noodle>	how do i reclaim my firefox icon.. was about to read the forum post before it died :(

[none]	[02:28]	<bliss_>	hi

[none]	[02:28]	<fiendskull9>	hey
[none]	[02:28]	<shriphani>	ok guys any ideas when the alternate cd is coming out
[none]	[02:28]	<fiendskull9>	whats the command to update from breezy to dap.?
[none]	[02:28]	<alleyoopster>	goteki: most likely you will need to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, this will reconfigure the screen. Be sure to back up xorg.conf first
[none]	[02:28]	<grimboy>	!tell noodle about easyubuntu
[none]	[02:28]	<Fujitsu>	shriphani, it was released over 3 hours ago.

[none]	[02:29]	<thoreauputic>	bliss_: erm, your fluxbox will be upgraded automatically
[none]	[02:29]	<thoreauputic>	bliss_: unless you compiled it or something
[none]	[02:30]	<wheelswitch>	i rekon xirc tab completion should be related to who posted last.
[none]	[02:30]	<SunTzuTech>	bliss_: fix /etc/apt/sources.list to get the dapper upgrade, then do an apt-get update and a apt-get dist-upgrade

[none]	[02:38]	<wycats>	It says I have 0 upgrades; does that mean the updates already happened automatically?

[none]	[02:38]	<robinl1>	.. holy shit
[none]	[02:38]	<wycats>	Will it continue providing the updates automatically as they are released?

[none]	[03:04]	<thoreauputic>	holycow: it was? I didn't think so...

[none]	[03:05]	<dooglus>	snoops: did you try using lilo instead of grub?  I've never managed to get grub to work.
[none]	[03:05]	<LinuxJones>	sybariten, there are rules in the channel please try to obey them.
[none]	[03:05]	<sybariten>	livingdaylight: nothing, its just that there are 1000 people here and if a lot of them just wanna say that they wanna throw a party or something, it may be a good idea to split people between the ubuntu chan and the ubuntu-offtopic chan .. just an idea
[none]	[03:05]	<tanek>	i hardly touch it and it considers that a double tap, plus the acceleration is so god damn annoying
[none]	[03:05]	<snoops>	I don't want to screw with this hdd too much dooglus
[none]	[03:05]	<thoreauputic>	holycow: hmm - OK, I didn't see that here, but then I have only a small home network
[none]	[03:05]	<livingdaylight>	sybariten, this is a christian ubuntu channel, hehehe...Re:offtopic? thhis is happy Dapper day, everyone is allowed to let it hang out a bit
[none]	[03:05]	<gnomefreak>	bliss_: those are extra repos they aide in building stuff
[none]	[03:05]	<tuxtheslacker>	are there any known problems with the linux usb drivers, and linux? because this thing struggles with reading/using SUB devices.
[positive]	[03:06]	<snoops>	because I would bloody HATE to have to reinstall applications on my xp install
[none]	[03:06]	<thoreauputic>	holycow: oh, yes, floppies were a problem - that I remember
[none]	[03:06]	<sybariten>	livingdaylight: yeah yeah, i guess youre right
[none]	[03:06]	<heanol>	dooglus, how the heck do you use lilo with the graphical installer?
[none]	[03:06]	<Paradoxx>	hmm, will there be a party here?
[none]	[03:06]	<Kholerabb1>	Whats this about Desktop and Server cds, is desktop a combination of LiveCD and installation CD??
[none]	[03:06]	<kahuna_>	Hi.Can I upgrade by soing s/breezy/dapper, then apt-get update && apt-get dift-upgrade?

[none]	[03:06]	<dooglus>	heanol: I don't know.  I installed it when I installed warty
[none]	[03:06]	<Paradoxx>	lol, the mirrors are gettin trashed
[none]	[03:06]	<heanol>	ok
[none]	[03:06]	<tuxtheslacker>	tanek, mine was picked up on install.
[none]	[03:06]	<chimai>	tanek : no idea. It works perfectly by default
[none]	[03:06]	<dooglus>	heanol: or was he called hoary.  I forget.
[none]	[03:06]	<Mirv>	anyone has a quick ling to the official ubuntu logo image? small size?
[positive]	[03:06]	<thoreauputic>	kahuna_: except for the typo, yes :)
[none]	[03:06]	<Mirv>	ling=link
[none]	[03:06]	<snoops>	dooglus..right well the graphical installer does not ask you to install grub, or ask you to specify the boot partition
[negative]	[03:07]	<tanek>	wierd... mine does not work good at all :(
[none]	[03:07]	<snoops>	so.. major frustration for me
[none]	[03:07]	<holycow>	thoreauputic, if i dist upgraded the entire 200 machines ... i would of been seriously *effed* ... i can't complain about free really it simply could of been terrible
[positive]	[03:07]	<livingdaylight>	sybariten: well i went to ubuntu+1 but it was dead. Hey, you're ok, you know? where is your party at? i might come and crash, hehe  ;)
[none]	[03:07]	<grimboy>	Wow, the new ubuntu.com is sexy
[none]	[03:07]	<kahuna_>	Any issues with breezy->dapper or will I be all set after the dist-upgrade?
[positive]	[03:07]	<dooglus>	snoops: so the installation has been streamlined?  :)
[none]	[03:07]	<livingdaylight>	grimboy; yea! you just noticed? Its smoooooooth
[none]	[03:07]	<h3sp4wn>	tuxtheslacker: Linux usb2 code is not very good (generally) especially on flaky hardware does it work using 1.1 in the bios ?
[none]	[03:07]	<bliss_>	gnomefreak: so its just the deb http  sections for 6.06 server?
[none]	[03:07]	<thoreauputic>	holycow: I imagine so - were the bugs squashed fairly fast after release?
[none]	[03:07]	<snoops>	dooglus most definitely has
[none]	[03:07]	<heanol>	snoops, please tell me if you solve it somehow.
[none]	[03:07]	<sybariten>	livingdaylight: hehe, no party here, i just want a global keyboard layout that works in X aswell as console, then i might take a shot of Baileys or something
[none]	[03:07]	<bimberi>	!tell kahuna_ about upgrade

[none]	[03:34]	<theine>	tuxtheslacker: why can't you install them?
[none]	[03:34]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: I suspect it wasn't
[none]	[03:34]	<tuxtheslacker>	kimo, I'm getting  5 kb/s
[none]	[03:34]	<theine>	tuxtheslacker: oh...
[none]	[03:34]	<Madeye>	weird, I'm trying to find high resolution copy of ubuntu logo but cant find any!
[none]	[03:34]	<grimboy>	tuxtheslacker, go make a cup of tea.
[none]	[03:34]	<tuxtheslacker>	I have the cd at 66%
[none]	[03:34]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: I think it wasn't... it gave me some error and shut down near the end...
[none]	[03:34]	<phos-phoros>	heh
[none]	[03:35]	<mauti>	hi
[none]	[03:35]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: the config process can take quite a while

[none]	[03:35]	<phos-phoros>	and I thought 124k/s was a pain
[none]	[03:35]	<Celestar>	installation seems stuck at a blue screeen ...
[positive]	[03:35]	<Celestar>	:P
[none]	[03:35]	<nathansnook>	hello
[none]	[03:35]	<MacSlow>	Madeye, there are vector-based version of it on the live/install CDs/ISOs
[none]	[03:35]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: hmm - try  sudo apt-get -f install
[none]	[03:35]	<spikeb>	!lart phos-phoros
[none]	[03:35]	<mauti>	Hello any first impressions of dapper drake yet ? I have just started downloading the iso image
[none]	[03:35]	<RandolphCarter>	Celestar: alt+f4 should take you to a log I think (alt+f1 to get back)
[none]	[03:35]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: or run  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[03:35]	<grimboy>	phos-phoros, why do I get a sudden urge to stab you with a fork?
[none]	[03:35]	<Madeye>	MacSlow, ohh thank you I didnt know that
[positive]	[03:35]	<tuxtheslacker>	I should just blow the system away and see if that isn't the better thing to do :-P
[none]	[03:36]	<tuxtheslacker>	can someone send me a screenshot of the stock desktop?
[none]	[03:36]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: did -f install: 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 3 not upgraded.
[positive]	[03:36]	<dr_willis>	mauti:  its the same as the earlier releases.. :P works good.
[none]	[03:36]	<gumpish>	oh, so they decided to release it after all?
[none]	[03:36]	<phos-phoros>	grimboy, I have no idea...why do you get a sudden urge to stab me with a fork?
[none]	[03:36]	<Astinus->	tuxtheslacker: looks same as 5.10
[none]	[03:36]	<grimboy>	tuxtheslacker, look at wikipedia
[none]	[03:36]	<pio_>	Openoffice icons are vanishing in gnome
[none]	[03:36]	<Celestar>	lets hope I'm not getting in to trouble for torrenting ...
[none]	[03:36]	<Mark_>	i simply cannot start the installation program, because during boot there is a problems with the cdrom. i get error like bad block. anyone?? had rpoblems with booting the cd (desktop 6.06)?
[negative]	[03:36]	<MacSlow>	tuxtheslacker, http://www.ubuntu.com/include/img/desktop.png
[none]	[03:36]	<grimboy>	phos-phoros, I'm getting 2.8kb/s
[none]	[03:36]	<gnomefreak>	michaels: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[03:36]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: did you try  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade   as well? Sometimes that fixes things...
[none]	[03:36]	<phos-phoros>	ouch
[none]	[03:36]	<lucasvo>	Celestar: why should you?
[none]	[03:36]	<tuxtheslacker>	what version of firefox ships with dapper?
[none]	[03:36]	<kestas>	Mark_: check MD5, burn again
[none]	[03:36]	<scheuri>	Mark_: problems during download? bad burning program?
[none]	[03:37]	<spikeb>	1.5.0
[none]	[03:37]	<Ocult>	hello.. i cant change my screen resolution.. just in breezy
[none]	[03:37]	<Jowi>	Mark_: check the md5
[none]	[03:37]	<Ocult>	why ?
[none]	[03:37]	<spikeb>	.3
[positive]	[03:37]	<Celestar>	lucasvo: just because I'm eating up bandwidth @ work :P
[none]	[03:37]	<lucasvo>	Celestar: ah
[none]	[03:37]	<Mark_>	Jowi, kestas, scheuri: MD5 was correct, i burned with nero
[none]	[03:37]	<MacSlow>	tuxtheslacker, 1.5.0.3
[none]	[03:37]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: just did, it only told me what packages were held back (and I'm uninstalling them now since they're not important)
[none]	[03:37]	<Celestar>	lucasvo: but ok, since our mirror down
[none]	[03:37]	<Jowi>	Mark_: try with another media
[none]	[03:37]	<RandolphCarter>	Ocult: the Gnome resolution config will only offer resolutions that are in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[none]	[03:37]	<mauti>	UBUNTU Rocks!! Why don't they give the directions in the main page itselves?
[none]	[03:37]	<theine>	Ocult: how do you try to change the screen resolution?
[none]	[03:37]	<scheuri>	Mark_: try burning it with a slower rate
[none]	[03:37]	<kestas>	Mark_: try burning slower
[none]	[03:37]	<Mark_>	Jowi, kestas, scheuri: and i had the same problem with RC
[none]	[03:37]	<grimboy>	Yay, a firefox that isn't crappy and old.
[none]	[03:37]	<Ocult>	>thefish<: system. preferences. screenresoltion
[none]	[03:37]	<MacSlow>	tuxtheslacker, but not 100% sure if that's before or after updates once you did a fresh install.
[none]	[03:37]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: so you still can't use dpkg-reconfigure?
[none]	[03:38]	<lucasvo>	Celestar: atm I have 65kbit upload
[none]	[03:38]	<kestas>	Mark_: could it be an HDD problem?
[none]	[03:38]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: will try again in a sec
[none]	[03:38]	<Ocult>	((theine)): system. preferences. screenresoltion
[none]	[03:38]	<mauti>	theine: try ctrl+alt+(plus on your keypad)
[none]	[03:38]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: sounds like a lock file that needs removing
[none]	[03:38]	<scheuri>	Mark_: try burning it with 8x or max 16x
[none]	[03:38]	<Celestar>	lucasvo: somewhere near 250kbyte here
[none]	[03:38]	<thefish>	Ocult: ??? mistype?
[none]	[03:38]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: still the same problem there
[positive]	[03:38]	<tuxtheslacker>	MacSlow, Just so long as there's a 1.5 series I'm happy :-) and once it updates :-P
[none]	[03:38]	<Ocult>	[theine] : all be strange..
[none]	[03:38]	<cef>	hrm.. the torrents are going well. over 683 GiB downloaded according to the tracker.. though the tracker seems to have stopped answering web requests for me
[none]	[03:38]	<lucasvo>	Celestar: well I am at home
[positive]	[03:38]	<charlotte>	:)
[none]	[03:38]	<Mark_>	Jowi, kestas, scheuri: i cannot imagine, im doing it with a kubuntu cd though, but i think it doesnt matter
[none]	[03:38]	<Ocult>	[theine] : in breezy that work good
[none]	[03:38]	<jordan>	Seveas, sorry - I got dropped for a while... what were you saying about updating freenx for the dapper libs?
[positive]	[03:38]	<[HUN] Big_T>	hi ubuntu users! :)
[positive]	[03:38]	<Celestar>	lucasvo: 10 GBps pipe :)
[none]	[03:38]	<theine>	"Ocult: try ""sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"" and hit enter until you reach the screen where you can change the screen resolution"
[none]	[03:38]	<MacSlow>	tuxtheslacker, I constantly updated my system form badger to dapper starting some months ago
[none]	[03:38]	<lucasvo>	Celestar: cool
[positive]	[03:38]	<scheuri>	charlotte: time to convert your landlord...:)
[positive]	[03:38]	<Celestar>	lucasvo: pity the workstation is stuck with 100MBps :P
[none]	[03:38]	<charlotte>	haha i doubt he will
[none]	[03:39]	<kork>	the ubuntu-6.06-dvd-i386.iso torrent isn't in good shape...
[none]	[03:39]	<Jowi>	Mark_: if you're using cdrw media, i would even test at x4. my cdburner act up sometimes
[none]	[03:39]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: OK - I'm not sure which file is the lock file for that but I think that is likely the problem
[none]	[03:39]	<cef>	ahh. 695GiB now
[none]	[03:39]	<jordan>	Seveas, I added the dapper repo, then did an update
[none]	[03:39]	<charlotte>	i only use windows for photoshop now
[none]	[03:39]	<Mark_>	Jowi, kestas, scheuri: i will try a ubuntu cd and burn it slower... should i try another burning program?
[none]	[03:39]	<Celestar>	lol
[positive]	[03:39]	<theine>	Ocult: try the dpkg-reconfigure thing and i'm fairly sure the gnome tool will then work as expected too
[none]	[03:39]	<Celestar>	I'm downloading at 2.5MB/sec :o
[none]	[03:39]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: what is a lock file?
[none]	[03:39]	<Ocult>	[theine] : it work in livecd ?
[none]	[03:39]	<cef>	kork: same here.. there isn't enough seeds currently.. but it's getting better
[none]	[03:39]	<scheuri>	Mark_: try burning it slower first before changing programm
[positive]	[03:39]	<tuxtheslacker>	charlotte, now I only use windows for my webcam I just bought :-(. that thing ticks me off like no other!
[none]	[03:39]	<SV>	i don't see the dapper upgrade in my update manger
[none]	[03:39]	<leoncio>	the torrent is bad
[none]	[03:39]	<theine>	Ocult: oh, you're using the live CD?
[none]	[03:39]	<Mark_>	scheuri, okay
[none]	[03:39]	<scheuri>	Mark_: and use CD-R instaed of CD-RW
[none]	[03:39]	<Fabricio>	ola....alguem pode me ajudar
[none]	[03:40]	<Malith>	Ubuntu
[none]	[03:40]	<kspath>	!br
[none]	[03:40]	<leoncio>	hola Fabricio
[none]	[03:40]	<ubotu>	Por favor use #ubuntu-br (/j #ubuntu-br) para ajuda em portugues. Obrigada.
[none]	[03:40]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: it's a file that stops a process interfering - in this case with dpkg
[none]	[03:40]	<grimboy>	Celestar, That's actually 1000 times faster than me.
[positive]	[03:40]	<JoeyB2>	I'm getting 110kB/s down with the torrent.. 2.5 more hours  :P
[none]	[03:40]	<mauti>	Celestar: good for you. Here it is like 64kpbs
[none]	[03:40]	<Mark_>	scheuri, yes i use imation CD-R
[none]	[03:40]	<scheuri>	Mark_: ah, okay
[none]	[03:40]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: a safety lock if you like
[none]	[03:40]	<Celestar>	mauti: what version? i386 ?
[none]	[03:40]	<SV>	someone ?

[none]	[03:40]	<[HUN] Big_T>	can anyone help me with my ubuntu install? i get an error message when the system root is mounting: cdrom_pc_intr: the drive appears confused
[none]	[03:40]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: got it
[none]	[03:40]	<scheuri>	kspath: that was spanish, wasnt it?
[none]	[03:40]	<Ocult>	((theine)): if i install the same problem happen
[none]	[03:40]	<Madeye>	MacSlow, Do you know where in the CD these images live ? the only images I found the splash .pcx and debian logo
[none]	[03:40]	<Ocult>	Hey, theine: i just cant understand why in breezy i dont have this problem
[none]	[03:40]	<Mark_>	scheuri, isnt there a way to check the cd from windows?
[none]	[03:40]	<charlotte>	hey i had a problem with installing ubuntu to this machine with the iso and installed it as data and was ok but my other machine had a problem with both and i want to put kubuntu on the other one and i've chosen the one for for lower ram to see if it'll work ok. i was just wondering if anyone had tried to install kubuntu on a slow machine and suceeded?
[none]	[03:40]	<javiolo>	scheuri no
[positive]	[03:40]	<kork>	cef: you can actually watch how the data gets from the 2 seeds to the faster peers :)
[none]	[03:40]	<leoncio>	tuxmaniac, the torrent that is in www.ubuntu.com
[none]	[03:40]	<Malith>	Mi ubuntu es bueno. Gracias amigo.
[none]	[03:41]	<Mark_>	scheuri, like doing a md5 on iso
[none]	[03:41]	<MacSlow>	"Madeye, in the ""Examples"" directory on the desktop once you booted into the live-cd"
[none]	[03:41]	<cef>	kork: hehe
[negative]	[03:41]	<rixxon>	i broke ubuntu :(
[positive]	[03:41]	<tuxtheslacker>	leoncio, I got mine from somewhere else :-(
[none]	[03:41]	<theine>	Ocult: i'm sure it'll work one you install Ubuntu to hard disk
[none]	[03:41]	<kork>	34,5% now
[none]	[03:41]	<grimboy>	rixxon, me too.
[none]	[03:41]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: well, after the upgrade crashed, I restarted and it seemed pretty much stuck on shutting down. all I had was my wallpaper and mouse cursor and no computer activity indicated on the lights. so I pressed the power button. may have interfered with something there.
[none]	[03:41]	<tuxtheslacker>	leoncio, I'm still downloading it though.
[none]	[03:41]	<SV>	i don't see the new upgrade in my update manger,what to do ?
[none]	[03:41]	<mauti>	Celestar: it is Pentium 4 356 MB RAM
[none]	[03:41]	<rixxon>	'Software index is broken'
[none]	[03:41]	<scheuri>	Mark_: there might be...but bruning it slower very likely will solve the problem...as long as md5 of your iso you download is fine, it should be okay
[none]	[03:41]	<Ocult>	[theine] : but u know this problem i said ?
[none]	[03:41]	<cef>	leoncio: there's a lot of torrents there. which image?
[none]	[03:41]	<scheuri>	javiolo...sorry then
[none]	[03:41]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: oops
[none]	[03:41]	<mauti>	Celestar: how about yours?
[none]	[03:41]	<grimboy>	rixxon, hey, you were on last night.
[none]	[03:41]	<rixxon>	i can't apt-get or install automatic updates
[none]	[03:41]	<theine>	Ocult: no, but i have a feeling
[none]	[03:41]	<Madeye>	MacSlow, ah I don't have the live
[none]	[03:41]	<Celestar>	mauti: ok I've started seeding i386 as well.
[none]	[03:41]	<Mark_>	scheuri, ah okay thx, so did this problem already occur before?
[negative]	[03:41]	<rixxon>	grimboy: probably? im always here. i have no life. :(
[positive]	[03:41]	<Celestar>	:)
[none]	[03:41]	<Madeye>	MacSlow, if you got the live can you send em to me ?

[none]	[03:42]	<Celestar>	mauti: UltraSparc T1 here
[none]	[03:42]	<SV>	????
[none]	[03:42]	<scheuri>	Mark_: yes...sort of...it is always an issue with CD-Rs and burning them with high speed (and then using them on different CD-devs)
[none]	[03:42]	<MacSlow>	Madeye, hm... got to mount it one sec
[negative]	[03:42]	<mauti>	Celestar: thanks but i am downloading ISOs. Bittorrents are taking twice the time :(

[none]	[03:42]	<Malith>	FUCK UBUNTU IN THE ASS
[none]	[03:42]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: so what do I do?
[none]	[03:42]	<grimboy>	What do I do when I start up and there's no gnome

[none]	[03:42]	<theine>	Ocult: really, don't worry about, if it still doesn't work after you installed Ubuntu, and I'm sure there are many people who'll be able to help you resolving the problem

[none]	[03:56]	<highvoltage>	isn't there a better way to do it these days?
[none]	[03:56]	<WAHa_06x36>	sladen: great, I installed Ubuntu so I wouldn't have to edit files in /etc/.

[none]	[03:57]	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: It's not that scary or dangerous.
[none]	[03:57]	<Lynoure>	SeMBoY: it no longer exists, new one will be at some point
[none]	[03:57]	<runes>	is there a way to modify the adduser so that it creates subfolders under the user folder?
[none]	[03:57]	<void^>	gah. each and every time i use gnome i find myself disabling the gnome-terminal keybindings that collide with irssi.
[none]	[03:57]	<Hobbsee>	SeMBoY: because it doesnt exit yet.
[none]	[03:57]	<Celestar>	how would the world work without torrents?
[none]	[03:57]	<WAHa_06x36>	Lynoure: it's annoying. I'm a programmer, I can do this shit, I just don't WANT to.

[none]	[03:58]	<sladen>	WAHa_06x36: the instructions in that document, *should* install a new breezy version of update-manager;  which then should allow you to upgrade the distribution to dapper.  did you restart the application after install the new version of update-manager?
[none]	[03:58]	<thoreauputic>	void^: yeah, it's annoying
[none]	[03:58]	<kspath>	runes: write your own version of adduser?
[negative]	[03:58]	<SeMBoY>	but i have ubuntu dapper ;( so no one will help here?

[none]	[03:58]	<thoreauputic>	void^: I use rxvt or urxvt with irssi
[none]	[03:58]	<ompaul>	SeMBoY, dapper is now released, therefore this channel is now for dapper
[positive]	[03:58]	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: :) I guess it's a matter of opinion. One thing I loved aout debian was that I could edit all the configuration files
[none]	[03:58]	<Some_Person>	sladen: where?
[none]	[03:58]	<runes>	hypnox and kspath I don't know what to put in the adduser.conf so that it grabs the user $ and creates the folder

[none]	[03:59]	<Some_Person>	sladen: what file?

[none]	[03:59]	<Madeye>	MacSlow,  if you can upload it somewhere it would be cool dude
[none]	[03:59]	<hypnox>	runes then you'll have to read the documentation, wotn you
[none]	[03:59]	<WAHa_06x36>	Lynoure: isn't the point of Ubuntu that you don't need to do that?
[none]	[03:59]	<Madeye>	MacSlow,  but my email wont handle such big attachment

[none]	[04:00]	<Lynoure>	WAHa_06x36: I think e.g. Suse is was more gui happy than Ubuntu but that is based on the situation with Suse years ago
[none]	[04:00]	<hypnox>	WAHa_06x36 try later, update-manager may work by then.

[none]	[04:03]	<hypnox>	runes if you want to do sometihng that isnt supported in adduser then you will have to figure it out some other way i guess
[none]	[04:03]	<mauti>	jlmr: what do you mean, it overwrites the MBR?
[none]	[04:04]	<snoops>	jlmr, it doesn't even seem to touch my MBR.
[none]	[04:04]	<snoops>	which is the problem.
[none]	[04:04]	<jlmr>	im not sure it does, but i dont want it too
[none]	[04:04]	<jlmr>	to*
[none]	[04:04]	<jlmr>	good
[none]	[04:04]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: well, I did that restart and then I could do the reconfigure thingy for x. but I still can't use the scroller to scroll. it works, it can set zoom together with control and all the nice stuff it's supposed to do, except it can't scroll up and down.
[none]	[04:04]	<aperez>	jose
[none]	[04:04]	<jlmr>	so if i install, i can use ntldr to load ubuntu?
[none]	[04:04]	<runes>	hypnox can you suggest a good link to documentation on this aside from the man pages? I tried google but all the links refer to are default config.
[none]	[04:04]	<jlmr>	instead of using GRUB to load windows
[none]	[04:04]	<hypnox>	jlmr if you do not have a boot manager installed then it shouldnt touch your mbr

[none]	[04:05]	<snoops>	I didn't think you could use the windows boot manager to boot linux?
[none]	[04:05]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: the option is something like zaxis mapping 4 5 in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[none]	[04:05]	<bruce89>	oem asks for the users details after install
[none]	[04:05]	<jlmr>	i know, i just wasnt sure what ubunut installer was going to do to MBR

[none]	[04:05]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: I know, I had to mess around with these options a ton when I first started using ubuntu cause I was used to the way I used to use the mouse's side-buttons
[none]	[04:05]	<gnomefreak>	jlmr: it will just install itslef to the mbr
[none]	[04:05]	<hypnox>	runes, ah, put the folders you want created in /etc/skel/
[none]	[04:06]	<Cass>	snoops, yeah you need to dd the first 512bytes of the /boot disk and dump to a file, copy that to windows fs then update boot.ini
[none]	[04:06]	<tolle>	snoops, I've never heard of it. you can point it to a grub loader i guess, but ntldr cant even read most filesystems
[none]	[04:06]	<michaels>	thoreauputic: I have it configured now like I used to
[positive]	[04:06]	<jlmr>	gnomefreak, thats not what in want, how do i prevent it :P

[none]	[04:07]	<jlmr>	gnomefreak: how?
[none]	[04:07]	<thoreauputic>	michaels: as far as I know the scrolling is the zaxis mappingthing - but someone else might help you
[none]	[04:07]	<spikeb>	dfgas, probably because the servers are overloaded
[none]	[04:07]	<chapium>	steko, loads fine for me
[positive]	[04:07]	<hypnox>	runes it's not smart, it just dumps everything in there into the homedir :)

[none]	[04:27]	<grimboy>	andrejkw, yes.
[none]	[04:27]	<snoops>	yes down for me too andrejkw
[none]	[04:27]	<Frogzoo>	Hamurabbi: the DVDs 3gig, so I'm guessing yes

[none]	[04:27]	<Zoohouse>	Thank you tristanmike

[none]	[04:27]	<Celestar>	step 1) re-enable root
[positive]	[04:27]	<jazzido>	and i'm pretty use i didn't upgrade to dapper :)
[none]	[04:27]	<jacquesmerde>	alternative install would still be more reliable than the livecd one, yeah?
[none]	[04:27]	<Frogzoo>	!tell Madeye about torrent
[none]	[04:27]	<claes>	jazzido, update-manager -d
[none]	[04:27]	<MacSlow>	Madeye, I priv.-messaged you it

[negative]	[04:28]	<sweetnjguy29>	zoo:  http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/faqguide-all.html  -- check out the end of the document to upgrade w.o a cd
[none]	[04:28]	<spikeb>	claes, you realise the -d bit is only for updating to bleeding edge, and that in a couple weeks, that will send people to edgy, right?
[none]	[04:28]	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, with some partitions
[none]	[04:28]	<MrKeuner>	why does't update manager already warn me that there is a release?
[none]	[04:28]	<sweetnjguy29>	no -d bit to upgrade
[none]	[04:28]	<jacquesmerde>	i take it when using synaptic to remove an app, there's no way to find out what dependencies i instaleld with it? no log? should i have used aptitude instead?
[none]	[04:28]	<crazy_penguin>	i change the nic in my computer and now i can't make it to be configureted automaticly at boot. why is that? also i modified iftab.
[none]	[04:29]	<jazzido>	perhaps breezy thinks that i already updated? how can i fix that?
[none]	[04:29]	<claes>	jazzido, check /etc/issue
[none]	[04:29]	<Katu>	I really like ubuntu OS and i am new to linux linux but unfortunately, my wireless notebook adapter WPC54G ver 4 not working out with UBUNTU, can anyone please help
[none]	[04:29]	<grimboy>	If I started upgrading yesterday will I get half RC and half official?
[none]	[04:29]	<snoops>	so the alternate install is the text based installer?
[none]	[04:29]	<claes>	spikeb, Yes but not today.
[none]	[04:29]	<Celestar>	AAHH
[none]	[04:29]	<concept10>	over a thousand people in the channel? unreal
[none]	[04:29]	<spikeb>	just a warning
[none]	[04:29]	<jazzido>	"claes, Ubuntu 5.10 ""Breezy Badger"" \n \l"
[none]	[04:29]	<Celestar>	does the installer eject the CD?
[none]	[04:29]	<lefty_2nd>	Hi, is it easier to try upgrade a version of Warty on dual boot (thats bit messed up - too much playing not enuff organising) or should I install Dapper from sratch?
[none]	[04:29]	<Celestar>	(during the installation process?)
[none]	[04:29]	<Cass>	katu, i use v5 of that card, you will need to use ndiswrapper
[none]	[04:29]	<zOap_wrk>	To upgrade from breezy to dapper, is the best way to alter 'breezy' to 'dapper' in sources.list and apt-get update / dist-upgrade?
[none]	[04:29]	<rackerz>	can someone tell me why totem can't establish connection to the sound server?
[none]	[04:29]	<Katu>	cass can you please PM me
[none]	[04:30]	<spikeb>	zOap_wrk, the best way is to use the update manager
[none]	[04:30]	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, but would it be necessary to burn the cd again (at 4x)?
[none]	[04:30]	<snoops>	lefty_2nd - I've been finding an issue with dual booting - the boot loader isn't working
[none]	[04:30]	<claes>	jazzido, Strange. Do what zOap_wrk just said then.
[none]	[04:30]	<tristanmike>	lefty_2nd, reinstall, you would have to upgrade to Hoary, then Breezy, then Dapper, you can't do a straight upgrade, it's best to install from scratch
[none]	[04:30]	<h3sp4wn>	zOap_wrk: You might want to try a faster mirror
[none]	[04:30]	<grimboy>	rackerz, bacause sound is broken on dapper.
[none]	[04:30]	<viS_>	how do I install the java sdk 5.0 on ubuntu 6.06 ?
[none]	[04:30]	<Greg2>	hello all
[none]	[04:30]	<Greg2>	wow... i've never been on a channel with over 1000 users
[none]	[04:30]	<zOap_wrk>	spikeb, ok, I'll do that.
[none]	[04:30]	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, cuz i have the feeling that it has to do with something else...
[none]	[04:30]	<viS_>	Is there a package?
[none]	[04:30]	<tristanmike>	gell viS_ about java
[none]	[04:30]	<rackerz>	grimboy, how do i fix it?
[none]	[04:30]	<tristanmike>	!tell viS_ about java
[none]	[04:30]	<Celestar>	ok step 0) get rid of bash
[none]	[04:30]	<jazzido>	claes: already tried that. but for some reason Packages.gz from dapper-updates doesn't gets downloaded
[none]	[04:30]	<Celestar>	the default user may do ANYTHING?
[none]	[04:30]	<grimboy>	rackerz, downgrade?
[none]	[04:30]	<zOap_wrk>	h3sp4wn, I'm using the swedish mirror. works fast
[negative]	[04:30]	<Corey>	hey guys all the games I play now are really laggy since i played around wiht the driver settings :(
[none]	[04:30]	<jazzido>	claes: MD5Sum mismatch, actually

[none]	[04:31]	<viS_>	!javadebs
[none]	[04:31]	<ubotu>	In Breezy: j2re1.4 is in multiverse. In Dapper: sun-java5-jre is in multiverse
[none]	[04:31]	<Krank1>	Got the live CD to work finally
[none]	[04:31]	<concept10>	is it the linux-images?
[negative]	[04:31]	<rackerz>	grimboy, im confused, in dapper RC totem worked fine if i used automatix :S
[none]	[04:31]	<claes>	jazzido, Could be your mirror that aren't updated fully yet.
[none]	[04:31]	<h3sp4wn>	z0ap_wrk: It will be fine
[negative]	[04:31]	<zenlinuxNH>	Are Ubuntu release celebrations getting out of hand? http://xumbi.eponym.com/_photos/dapper.jpg
[none]	[04:31]	<MrKeuner>	why does't update manager already warn me that there is a release?
[none]	[04:31]	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, how many hard drives do you have ?
[none]	[04:31]	<jazzido>	claes: i'm using archive.ubuntu.com
[none]	[04:31]	<buzzed>	so can we talk about Dapper here now?
[none]	[04:31]	<lefty_2nd>	ty guys, thought so.  Btw what how so you make a live cd version to use a usb drive - sorry for noob questions, now that got dapper im wanting to do more than just play with it when fed up of M$
[none]	[04:31]	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, I told you, one, with some partitions

[none]	[04:32]	<Hexidigital_>	Happy Dapper Day everyone! i assume channel Ubuntu+1 no longer exists??
[none]	[04:32]	<MarcN>	whois zenlinuxNH
[none]	[04:32]	<Celestar>	ok how would I start the ssh daemon?
[none]	[04:32]	<andrejkw>	The Dapper installer is so unreliable, it's insane.
[positive]	[04:32]	<claes>	jazzido, Then perhaps it's to hammered by all the release champange. Or perhaps by all the downloads. :-)
[none]	[04:32]	<buzzed>	ubuntu+1 is still there
[none]	[04:32]	<zenlinuxNH>	That's actually a co-worder of mine, my photo is much tamer.
[none]	[04:32]	<Katu>	cass u there? why you not responding
[none]	[04:32]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: have you installed openssh?
[positive]	[04:32]	<Frogzoo>	buzzed: yep
[none]	[04:32]	<viS_>	tristanmike: i get the following error: E: Couldn't find package sun-java5-bin
[none]	[04:32]	<grimboy>	Celestar, try ssh 127.1 because it runs automatically from install of ubuntu for me.
[none]	[04:32]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: lets see.
[none]	[04:32]	<shenki>	jdub, noticed your blog post and tried out 'apt-get install vmware-player'
[none]	[04:32]	<snoops>	what kind of installer does 'alternate' have?
[none]	[04:32]	<dunnix>	hello everyone
[none]	[04:32]	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, becauwse I don't know if you have another hard drive on /dev/hdc. Your cdrom has bad sectors on it.
[none]	[04:32]	<buzzed>	i have 1 hour 22 minutes
[none]	[04:33]	<snoops>	because the desktop release uses the live cd to install, doesn't it?
[none]	[04:33]	<tristanmike>	viS_, have you enabled the repos ?
[none]	[04:33]	<Cass>	Katu, i pm'd you, did you not get a screen with me ?

[none]	[04:33]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: server
[none]	[04:33]	<shenki>	a question, does the system require a reboot before you can run vmware-player?
[none]	[04:33]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: problems with finding the CD.
[none]	[04:33]	<Cass>	Katu, i did it again

[none]	[04:33]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: ok... in terminal -> sudo apt-get install openssh-server

[none]	[04:33]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: yeah, but it can't read the CD for some reason ...
[none]	[04:33]	<Cass>	ahh ok, i didnt see your reply
[none]	[04:34]	<Mark_>	LinuxJones, but what should i try now? burn at 4x?
[none]	[04:34]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: you should disable the cdrom repos
[none]	[04:34]	<claes>	fatalblu, Only vmware-player I think.

[none]	[04:34]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: I'd do that how?
[none]	[04:34]	<fatalblu>	server is the one i want to keep updated, i don't care about player
[none]	[04:34]	<claes>	jazzido, Check another mirror.
[none]	[04:34]	<dunnix>	rackerz: whats wrong with your sound?
[none]	[04:34]	<voraistos>	 is the UK mirror OK ?
[none]	[04:34]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: system -> administration -> synaptic package manager :: click Settings-> repositories
[none]	[04:34]	<rackerz>	totem says it cannot establish connection to the sound server
[none]	[04:35]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: lemme know when you get there
[none]	[04:35]	<claes>	fatalblu, perhaps the server will come when it's released. Depends on vmware license.
[positive]	[04:35]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: I have no GUI, telnet only :)
[none]	[04:35]	<dunnix>	rackerz: does your other sound work?
[none]	[04:35]	<Greg2>	i'm a bit confused about which 6.06 iso i need to d/l... it's for a permanent dual boot setup
[none]	[04:35]	<Greg2>	do i want the desktop, server, or alternate install iso?
[negative]	[04:35]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: :( sorry, dont know how to do it by command line
[none]	[04:35]	<Ng>	Greg2: desktop
[none]	[04:35]	<Frogzoo>	Greg2: alternate if ur upgrading?

[none]	[04:35]	<Celestar>	Hexidigital_: I'll find out
[none]	[04:35]	<Hexidigital_>	Celestar:: can you read graphical websites?
[none]	[04:35]	<Ng>	Celestar: edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[negative]	[04:36]	<Stork>	dapper isn't cool :(
[none]	[04:36]	<Hexidigital_>	ubotu:: tell Celestar about easysource
[none]	[04:36]	<LinuxJones>	Mark_, check the md5 sum of the .iso file you downloaded (I dunno how to do that in windows)

The latest version, known by its code name, ""The Diaper Drake,"" includes special features designed to make Linux easier and more comfortable for niggers the world over."
[none]	[04:43]	<SHUTTLEWRTH>	"""Niggers have always had trouble understanding new technology,"" Shuttleworth began. ""Computers are no exception. Some people have said this is because niggers are dumb, but I believe the real problem is that technology has traditionally been designed for white people. Ubuntu changes all that. It was developed from the ground up with niggers in mind. It will usher in a whole new era of Afro-ergonomic computing."""

He proceeded to elaborate, but OpenOffice.org Impress crashed at that point."

[none]	[05:06]	<ubuntuNewbee>	KenSentMe, lord_rob: these are the facts: I downloaded Desktop CD and booted from it. The menu showed and there it was the Start/Install Ubuntu. I clicked on it hopping that the installer would ask me what on earth I want: Start for trying, or Install Complete, all in graphical. But nothing of what I would have liked happened. It just started to load and load... It loaded the tryout version...
[none]	[05:06]	<ubuntuNewbee>	...of Ubuntu (LiveCD). I launched the install from there, but it took like 5 minutes just to show the first Installer Window. That's unacceptable. Fedora Core 5 installed in 20 minutes and Ubuntu could take forever to install that way. I tried to install it on 2 machines with 256MB of RAM. Text based install is not an option if we want to show Ubuntu to the others. SEE? I hope I was clear now

[none]	[05:20]	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: probably, if you aren't using group permissions anywhere then it shouldn't matter

[positive]	[05:20]	<void^>	ubuntuNewbee: i don't know what your particular problem is (if there is one). i just made the experience that sometimes certain cd readers don't like certain brands of cdrs or cdrws. this drive in particular doesn't like any cdrws (constant spinups/downs).
[none]	[05:20]	<krazykit>	scorpion007: if you edit lilo.conf, you need to rerun lilo
[none]	[05:20]	<bbrazil>	scorpion007: aftering altering lilo.conf, you need to run 'lilo'
[none]	[05:20]	<jacquesmerde>	fatalblu: but i'll do your chown instead. do i have to unchown my original chown first?
[none]	[05:20]	<carthik>	MrKeuner, oh. In that case, no, the dvds cant have the entire repo on them.
[negative]	[05:21]	<scorpion007>	krazykit: I did that but it just spits out errors about /proc/devices not being present... :(
[none]	[05:21]	<fatalblu>	jacquesmerde: nah you can just run mine as it

[positive]	[05:21]	<lefty_2nd>	lol way things are going, even with lag on forums, might find answer quicker.  4 those who missed it, any one with exp of using a live cd and usb drive to store settings, what partitions might I need to use same drive on mac and pc to show Ubuntu to work.
[none]	[05:21]	<The_Machine>	question:  after doing an apt-get dist-upgrade, will it give all the new gnome desktop wallpapers and everything, as if i did a CD installation?

[none]	[05:26]	<eXistenZ>	Hobbsee, why?
[none]	[05:26]	<Celestar>	WarOfAttrition: I have 4 Gigabit NICs, 1 100 MBps management NIC, 1 RS-232 port with 9600bps. why do I need a graphics card?
[none]	[05:26]	<toran>	Can someone PLEASE help?
[none]	[05:26]	<tristanmike>	eXistenZ, they are unnoffical, and thus unsupported and thus can break your system

[none]	[05:46]	<sybariten>	on Damnsmalllinux, when booting, i get US keyboard. I get my swedish characters by exiting X and doing loadkeys se-latin1. This seems to affect the whole system. Isnt there something similar i can do on Ubuntu??
[none]	[05:46]	<Frogzoo>	!tell dapper about torrent

[none]	[05:46]	<Frogzoo>	dapper: you need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list & swap breezy/dapper
[none]	[05:46]	<saif>	krazykit, i did it on my router i am forwording to the right port and ip, azurues configured for the port, but still says that, could it be because i installed azurues manually? not using dpkg?
[none]	[05:46]	<Afrodita>	yo voy a ahecer impress
[none]	[05:46]	<mwe>	sybariten: you need to configure xorg.conf
[none]	[05:47]	<sybariten>	if i do loadkeys se-latin1 on my ubuntu system, i just get errors in a long loop
[none]	[05:47]	<fatalblu>	sybariten: the folder with the keymaps might not be in the path, try locate se-latin and give loadkeys an absolute path
[none]	[05:47]	<krazykit>	saif: that has nothing to do with it.
[none]	[05:47]	<dapper>	Frogzoo, Oh okay.  That page doesn't make that clear at all.

[none]	[05:59]	<Elops>	If I download the source CDs of ubuntu is it faster to add stuff using apt-cdrom ?
[none]	[05:59]	<dapper>	Because update-manager seems to tell me I should use synaptic or apt-get dist-upgrade.  But the webpage says I can use update-manager.
[none]	[06:00]	<tuxtheslacker>	who shit!

[none]	[06:27]	<cara>	Hi all
[none]	[06:27]	<MrObvious>	Shaezsche: Is it a winmodem?
[none]	[06:27]	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: what do you mean? download the windows driver on a windows machine, transfer it to your linux computer, find out the info as he said, then google for it and see if theres linux support
[none]	[06:27]	<JoeyB2>	!nvidia
[negative]	[06:27]	<ubotu>	Help about installing the nVidia drivers on Ubuntu can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[none]	[06:27]	<cara>	hmm
[none]	[06:27]	<dontm>	!laptop
[negative]	[06:27]	<ubotu>	from memory, laptop is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops or http://www.linux-laptop.net/ or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam, or tuxmobil.org
[none]	[06:27]	<soundray>	Shaezsche: Winmodems are the devil's. Get a decent external one.
[none]	[06:27]	<Chobo-Mog>	Ok, I'll give that a shot.  Thank you
[none]	[06:27]	<OmniD>	quick somebody make a trillian clone
[none]	[06:27]	<jra>	Shaezsche: quit it. either get supported hardware or bug the manufacturer to release free specs but don't go blame linux or any distibution for that matter
[none]	[06:27]	<ompaul>	!winmodem
[negative]	[06:27]	<ubotu>	[winmodem]  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DialupModemHowto for instructions on setting up your modem (including winmodems). Additional info can be found at http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/
[none]	[06:27]	<damo21>	does the dapper installer have an option for xfce instead of gnome?
[none]	[06:27]	<Shaezsche>	i dont know if its a winmodem!, the linuxant thingy doesnt even recognize it
[none]	[06:27]	<h3sp4wn>	damo21: Use xubuntu
[none]	[06:27]	<rendo>	Is it dialup?
[none]	[06:28]	<Ademan>	jra: he's not really criticizing anymore, its fine, we might as well help
[none]	[06:28]	<rendo>	If so, quit being cheap and get DSL or Cable.
[none]	[06:28]	<cara>	Hmm does anyone use a touchpad?
[none]	[06:28]	<soundray>	Shaezsche: it is a winmodem. Get an external one, or a PCMCIA one if you have to.
[none]	[06:28]	<nollidj>	any advice for an old machine (300 mhz pentium ii) and getting it to be more responsive?
[none]	[06:28]	<WarOfAttrition>	Shaezsche|  you are much better off just replacing it with an external serial modem
[none]	[06:28]	<yukonho>	dontm: thanks, that's all I needed!
[none]	[06:28]	<MrObvious>	rendo: He's only got dialup because he lives too far out in the woods.
[none]	[06:28]	<damo21>	is there a separate iso for xubuntu 6.06? is there such a thing?
[positive]	[06:28]	<rendo>	Get Satellite. :P
[none]	[06:28]	<Grunt>	are there instructions for install Xgl on dapper
[none]	[06:28]	<jra>	nollidj: yeah, get rid of gnome.
[none]	[06:28]	<stjepan>	is dapper released?
[none]	[06:28]	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, ask the manfacturer -- fpr the info and I concur with WarOfAttrition
[none]	[06:28]	<rendo>	stjepan Yes
[none]	[06:28]	<soundray>	yes, Grunt
[positive]	[06:28]	<ompaul>	stjepan, /topic ;-)
[none]	[06:28]	<soundray>	!tell Grunt about xgl
[none]	[06:28]	<MrObvious>	damo21: What do you mean a seperate ISO?
[none]	[06:28]	<xiko>	jesus i LOVE apt, it is the most amazing thing ever. Thats it, im keeping my old hd for games only. Im ubuntu for work forever now
[none]	[06:28]	<Shaezsche>	well my modem isnt the only issue, it also doesnt properly support the intel 915 integrated graphics
[none]	[06:29]	<nollidj>	jra: hmm, the xfce desktop just isn't put together as well, and this is supposed to be a desktop for people who aren't very computer-literate.  any other suggestions?
[positive]	[06:29]	<rendo>	AFK installing Dapper :b
[negative]	[06:29]	<eXIstenZ>	Can anyone send me his repos, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 doesn't work.
[none]	[06:29]	<pike__>	damo21: well you can type server at bootup that will just install base and then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[none]	[06:29]	<Shaezsche>	detects it as 815 and gives me all kidns of issues
[none]	[06:29]	<revmouse>	nollidj, try using xubuntu, its an ubuntu system geared to be more lightweight
[none]	[06:29]	<damo21>	thanks pike
[none]	[06:29]	<nollidj>	revmouse: is this a separate distro?
[none]	[06:29]	<issaker>	can someone tell me how to execute a .run package?
[none]	[06:29]	<gourdin>	!kde
[none]	[06:29]	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: like what sort of issues?
[negative]	[06:29]	<PPower>	xubuntu found at http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
[negative]	[06:29]	<dontm>	eXIstenZ: : use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
[none]	[06:29]	<nollidj>	issaker: it is probably a self-extracting shell script.  try '/bin/sh blah.run'
[none]	[06:29]	<cara>	Was wondering if I could isntall ubuntu from the live cd
[none]	[06:29]	<kspath>	nollidj: generic advice, max RAM and min what is running on it  perhaps no X
[none]	[06:29]	<Shaezsche>	like it says LCD ON every 5 minutes
[none]	[06:29]	<voraistos>	sh xxx.run
[none]	[06:29]	<damo21>	i thought dapper was going to release an xubuntu
[none]	[06:29]	<hazart>	issaker: chmod +x the file and ./<filename> it
[none]	[06:29]	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, the importance of getting supported hardware, however that being said work on one issue at a time, now go find out about your modem
[none]	[06:29]	<Grunt>	Soundray: sorry whats does the !tell mean
[none]	[06:29]	<revmouse>	nollidj, well you can type server at bootup that will just install base and then apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[none]	[06:29]	<Ademan>	cara: the dapper live yes
[none]	[06:30]	<nollidj>	hmm
[none]	[06:30]	<PPower>	issaker: just run it like a normal sh. ./(script)
[none]	[06:30]	<eXIstenZ>	dontm, that is for dapper?
[none]	[06:30]	<dontm>	eXIstenZ: : just change gb to us if ur in the states
[none]	[06:30]	<nollidj>	i guess i'll flatten and reinstall, then
[none]	[06:30]	<Shaezsche>	ompaul what is the sudo command?
[none]	[06:30]	<DBO>	!sudo
[negative]	[06:30]	<ubotu>	I heard sudo is a command that will let users run commands as root. Look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo for all information.
[none]	[06:30]	<dontm>	"eXIstenZ: yes look at the url, see the word ""dapper"" in the comments? =-)"
[none]	[06:30]	<soundray>	Grunt: it means that I asked the bot to send you a private message. Look around your IRC client, you should see it.
[none]	[06:30]	<cara>	guess I could go ahead an bunr the regular disk to a disk
[none]	[06:30]	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, look I am going to get the bot to message you all the info you want is there
[positive]	[06:30]	<eXIstenZ>	dontm, oh yeah :)
[none]	[06:30]	<damo21>	YAYYY Xubuntu 6.06!!!!
[none]	[06:30]	<revmouse>	yay!
[none]	[06:30]	<Shaezsche>	lol
[none]	[06:30]	<issaker>	ppower thanks that did the trick what does sh do?
[none]	[06:30]	<TheMadman>	you can cheat on the live cd and type sudo setuser root
[none]	[06:30]	<MrObvious>	damo21: What do you mean a seperate ISO?
[positive]	[06:31]	<orangehaw>	Help wanted: my toshiba M60-171 with resolution 1440x900 (wxga) produces startup sounds but no screen
[none]	[06:31]	<Grunt>	Soundray: brilliant thanks for the link
[none]	[06:31]	<anto9us>	nollidj, you can disable some gnome features such as animations and draw windows while draggin by using configuration editor
[none]	[06:31]	<eigenlambda>	lol... i love torrence...
[negative]	[06:31]	<damo21>	MrObvious: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
[none]	[06:31]	<PPower>	issaker: sh is a shell that linux uses. a sh is a type of script
[none]	[06:31]	<nollidj>	ugh... is there a non-https access to wiki.ubuntu.com?
[none]	[06:31]	<tbenita>	hi, can upgrade to lts by chaging breezy to lts in the sources.list and apt-get dist-upgrade ?
[none]	[06:31]	<eigenlambda>	now, to hope that ubuntu deals with my usb mouse properly
[none]	[06:31]	<Ademan>	the dapper install cd is limping along at 8kb/s (its a torrent too)
[none]	[06:31]	<DBO>	orangehaw, does CTRL + ALT + F1 get you a console?
[none]	[06:31]	<dontm>	tbenita: yes
[none]	[06:31]	<ompaul>	Shaezsche, please don't use that word it is derogatory
[none]	[06:31]	<orangehaw>	DBO: yes
[none]	[06:31]	<nollidj>	anto9us: already done... this is just dog-slow, more or less, and the idea is to change it from fat lazy dog-slow to middle-aged suffering from arthritis dog-slow
[negative]	[06:31]	<axisys>	i get this error when running gksudo update-manager but it did not upgrade to dapper .. http://pastebin.com/751596
[none]	[06:31]	<tbenita>	ok thanks dontm
[none]	[06:31]	<issaker>	gahhhhh
[none]	[06:31]	<hazart>	"Will, the dapper repository stay ""stable"" and not upgrade package versions? In other words, should i add any edgy sources to my list?"
[none]	[06:32]	<nzt>	sorry bad request
[none]	[06:32]	<DBO>	orangehaw, can you put your gdm and xorg logs on patebin from me?
[none]	[06:32]	<issaker>	ppower, now when i install i get no write permission
[none]	[06:32]	<anto9us>	nollidj, if you can lay your hands on more memory that will make a big difference
[none]	[06:32]	<KhZillu>	whats this SMP PREEMPT kernel?
[none]	[06:32]	<wastrel>	well howdy everybody
[none]	[06:32]	<stasislove>	so if i have a module in a directory, there is no way to start it when ubuntu starts?
[none]	[06:32]	<nollidj>	anto9us: i've already hit this machine's maximum memory capacity
[negative]	[06:32]	<damo21>	MrObvious: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/dapper/release/
[none]	[06:32]	<DBO>	orangehaw, can you put your gdm and xorg logs on patebin for me?  (fixed dumb typo)
[none]	[06:32]	<KhZillu>	its the plain i686 but it hast the SMP PREEMPT tag on it.
[none]	[06:32]	<nollidj>	it's the cpu that's killing it, and it's an old laptop
[none]	[06:32]	<PPower>	issaker: what package is it
[none]	[06:32]	<deus_>	is is out?
[negative]	[06:32]	<orangehaw>	DBO: there's no way to paste it on pastebin since i have no inet & screen yet ;(
[none]	[06:32]	<issaker>	ppower what do you mean?
[negative]	[06:32]	<Shaezsche>	http://www.linmodems.org/ the scan modem tool here is broken
[none]	[06:32]	<soundray>	stasislove: there is -- you could add an insmod command to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
[none]	[06:32]	<anto9us>	nollidj, if you have another HD kicking around you could configure a raid 0, that will speed things up
[none]	[06:32]	<deus_>	is dapper released?
[none]	[06:32]	<hazart>	Will the dapper repos. still contain new packages, or will there be a new one for edgy?
[none]	[06:32]	<nollidj>	anto9us: laptop
[none]	[06:32]	<issaker>	ppower its a game called tremulous
[none]	[06:32]	<PPower>	issaker: is it for java or a nvidia package.
[none]	[06:33]	<nollidj>	thanks, though
[none]	[06:33]	<krazykit>	hazart: it'll be fairly stable.  bug fixes and security fixes will be added, and there will be backports eventually.  for right now, there are no edgy repos
[none]	[06:33]	<nevchen>	deus_,  yeah
[none]	[06:33]	<NoUse>	deus_ read the topic
[none]	[06:33]	<h3sp4wn>	stasislove: just add it to the bottom of /etc/modules is the easiest way
[none]	[06:33]	<dontm>	just a fyi to the ops: dapperupgrade wiki page = typos on command lines and the url w/ the source list is down
[none]	[06:33]	<DBO>	"orangehaw, ok, do a ""sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"" and when you select the driver, select VESA"
[none]	[06:33]	<PPower>	issaker: right. try sudo ./blah.run. enter your password. you need to be in the folder where the run is
[none]	[06:33]	<stasislove>	soundray, i use insmod to start it, but when i reboot i have to do insmod again
[none]	[06:33]	<MrObvious>	Got it damo
[none]	[06:33]	<orangehaw>	DBO: I ran the xserver-xorg for the correct resolution, but nothings happens. Not even errors for as far as I can see
[none]	[06:33]	<MrObvious>	I keep d/cing
[none]	[06:33]	<krazykit>	hazart: edgy won't be started on for a couple weeks yet, i hear.
[none]	[06:33]	<MrObvious>	damo21: I think it's just one ISO for your architecture
[none]	[06:33]	<soundray>	stasislove: read my line carefully
[none]	[06:33]	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: what makes you say that?
[negative]	[06:33]	<antimoof>	as http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6666 is being utterly thrashed, are there any mirrors of that file around?
[none]	[06:33]	<hazart>	krazykit: okay, but if i don't change my sources i will be stuck with gnome 2.14 and the current version apps that i have now?
[none]	[06:34]	<stasislove>	soundray, sorry
[none]	[06:34]	<wastrel>	oh i forgot dapper's out
[none]	[06:34]	<PPower>	issaker: did it work
[none]	[06:34]	<Shaezsche>	say what?
[none]	[06:34]	<fatalblu>	out like a boner in sweatpants
[none]	[06:34]	<davidhouse>	hi guys. how can i get apt to give me a list of the currently installed packages?
[negative]	[06:34]	<dontm>	antimoof:  use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
[none]	[06:34]	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: that the modem detector is broken
[positive]	[06:34]	<DShepherd>	wastrel: forget no more! :-)
[none]	[06:34]	<damo21>	MrObvious: im just really excited because its the first ubuntu release with xfce as a separate release!!! Xubuntu 6.06!!!!
[none]	[06:34]	<pike__>	orangehaw: when you type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg it should take you through a whole setup asking questions and stuff
[none]	[06:34]	<to0om>	hi folks, a question: why does the battery-panel in dapper always notify me that there are only 3 minutes left although the battery is almost full?
[none]	[06:34]	<xiko>	hmm how many packages to update dapper? right now m in number 195
[none]	[06:34]	<soundray>	Shaezsche: don't say lol when you should be saying thankyou
[none]	[06:34]	<AlienX>	davidhouse, dpkg -l
[none]	[06:34]	<Shaezsche>	oh, because when i dl it, it says the file is corrupt
[none]	[06:34]	<wastrel>	i just want my palm sync to work
[positive]	[06:34]	<DShepherd>	damo21: :-)
[none]	[06:34]	<Shaezsche>	winrar wont open it
[none]	[06:34]	<krazykit>	"hazart: um, yes... gnome 2.14 is the latest, you know.  you're not really ""stuck"" with it."
[none]	[06:34]	<NoUse>	davidhouse dpkg -l | grep ii
[none]	[06:34]	<orangehaw>	pike_: I know, did that
[none]	[06:34]	<Jowi>	orangehaw, DBO : if you get sound the xorg.conf should be configured somewhat right. i think it is the framebuffer that is not supported.  if you can, try to disable framebuffer in BIOS or in grub
[none]	[06:34]	<Ademan>	Shaezche: oh... lol
[none]	[06:35]	<simp>	emm... hello
[none]	[06:35]	<issaker>	ppower it says command not found
[none]	[06:35]	<bluefoxicy>	This channel is now about dapper  o.o
[positive]	[06:35]	<xcomputerman>	ok, can someone give me a fast mirror? :)
[none]	[06:35]	<davidhouse>	NoUse, AlienX: brilliant, thanks.
[none]	[06:35]	<krazykit>	hazart: if you really want to be on the edge, wait for edgy eft to get it's repos started and migrate to that.
[none]	[06:35]	<xcomputerman>	all of them seem to be crawling.
[none]	[06:35]	<simp>	i have a little question
[none]	[06:35]	<orangehaw>	Jowi: i'll try that
[none]	[06:35]	<hazart>	krazykit: yes, it know, but i would like to have the 2.15.1 whenever it's released, if you know what i mean...
[none]	[06:35]	<DBO>	Jowi, you can also disable it in xserver reconfigure =P
[none]	[06:35]	<issaker>	sudo: ./tremulous-1.1.0-installer.x86.run: command not found
[none]	[06:35]	<AlienX>	davidhouse, np
[none]	[06:35]	<bbrazil>	xcomputerman: use bittorrent
[negative]	[06:35]	<simp>	if i try to boot it says error loading OS... :S
[none]	[06:35]	<PPower>	issaker: can we do private msg as it is getting a bit to crouded
[none]	[06:35]	<xcomputerman>	bbrazil: can't, i'm at work.
[negative]	[06:35]	<dontm>	xcomputerman:  use http://www.dirtytechno.org/linux/sources.list instead of the source list url in the wiki
[positive]	[06:35]	<krazykit>	hazart: hah, than wait for edgy.  you'll last a few weeks til' it's up :-P
[none]	[06:35]	<jra>	"""a bit"".. how cute"
[none]	[06:35]	<xcomputerman>	dontm: i need an iso.
[none]	[06:35]	<simp>	h3sp4wn are you here anyway?
[positive]	[06:36]	<hazart>	krazykit: okay, that's nice! I really love the simplicity og the ubuntu/debian package system :)
[none]	[06:36]	<issaker>	ppower sure
[none]	[06:36]	<dontm>	xcomputerman: bit torrent buddy heh
[none]	[06:36]	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: frankly, ubuntu is an absolute dream on desktops, but on laptops its a nightmare, i'm on a laptop now, it took me about 2 months to get it up (well, really i was butting my head up against a wall, it only worked because i switched from breezy to dapper)
[none]	[06:36]	<xcomputerman>	dontm: bittorrent not allowed here at work
[none]	[06:36]	<ompaul>	xcomputerman, waith until the weekend is over and it should be easier to get one
[none]	[06:36]	<dontm>	xcomputerman: u hard set on fresh install? why not just upgrade?
[none]	[06:36]	<krazykit>	hazart: just remember, edgy will by syncing with debian sid, and it'll be rather unstable at first.
[none]	[06:36]	<jra>	calling dpkg simplistic is funny
[positive]	[06:36]	<xcomputerman>	dontm: because it is a fresh install :)
[none]	[06:36]	<h3sp4wn>	simp: What do you need ?
[none]	[06:36]	<dontm>	xcomputerman: oh work bummer
[none]	[06:36]	<antimoof>	muchas gracia, dontm.
[none]	[06:36]	<Shaezsche>	anyone know if cedega works with oblivion yet?
[none]	[06:36]	<ro>	Ademan: Set it up on two laptops no problem, I think it's pot luck really : )
[none]	[06:36]	<Thib_G>	Someone could give me linux-restricted-modules-2.6.15-22-686 and the older version of nvidia-glx, please ?
[none]	[06:36]	<simp>	join #something can you?
[none]	[06:36]	<dontm>	antimoof: de nada
[none]	[06:36]	<DBO>	Shaezsche, no it does not
[none]	[06:36]	<Jowi>	DBO: yeah, but it should not be neccessary to set the server to vesa. most likely the correct driver is in use for xorg.
[none]	[06:36]	<soundray>	simp: have you got grub installed?
[positive]	[06:36]	<hazart>	krazykit: it's just that i just switched my amd64 from gentoo to ubunty, and i am used to run breakmygentoo overlays, so i miss the edge :P
[none]	[06:36]	<simp>	yes i do soundray
[none]	[06:36]	<Ademan>	Shaezsche: I saw someone in a forum claimed to have been doing it

[none]	[06:37]	<indro>	krazykit: edgy will by syncing with debian sid <- why do you know that?
[none]	[06:37]	<dontm>	xcomputerman: im assuming u tried all the mirrors on the wiki page?
[none]	[06:37]	<rendo>	With Nero Burning rom, burning the 6.06.iso to a DVD what format should I use so it's bootable so I can install the damn thing on boot frm disc?

[none]	[06:38]	<KhZillu>	Ohzie I'll find out soon enough
[negative]	[06:38]	<ubotu>	"upgrade is probably Upgrading to Ubuntu 5.10 breezy -> http://wiki.ubuntu.com/BreezyUpgrade. Upgrading to Ubuntu 6.06 Dapper -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades . Note command line: gksudo ""update-manager -d"" always updates to the bleeding edge."
[none]	[06:38]	<jra>	rendo: what format options you got?
[none]	[06:38]	<rendo>	There's a DVD image?
[none]	[06:38]	<DBO>	Ohzie, did you have manually installed ATI or Nvidia drivers?
[none]	[06:38]	<krazykit>	indro: that's how all the releases start, by syncing with sid, then going from there.
[none]	[06:38]	<semq>	update manager not working (1 file missing)

[positive]	[06:38]	<DBO>	Jowi, thats the idea =)
[none]	[06:38]	<xiko>	I just edited /etc/apt/sources.list substituting breezy with dapper
[positive]	[06:38]	<hazart>	krazykit: But maybe it's time to settle down for some stability after all :D - ubuntu really offers a bit of everything. The only thing i miss is the ability to select which features packages should come with. Like gentoo's USE flags.
[none]	[06:38]	<tristanmike>	rendo, yup
[none]	[06:38]	<xiko>	it is updating right now
[none]	[06:38]	<tiger>	I want a program to run when system starts up, how do I do that?
[positive]	[06:38]	<rendo>	There was ISO, UDF and something else, guess I need the DVD image. :P
[none]	[06:38]	<Ohzie>	DBO: I did, but changing the driver back to vga doesn't help at all. Same error.
[none]	[06:38]	<rendo>	Bwahahha.
[none]	[06:38]	<indro>	krazykit: okay, thanks krazykit
[none]	[06:38]	<rixxon>	the movie preview in nautilus shows the middle of the movie?
[none]	[06:38]	<DBO>	Ohzie, what error?
[none]	[06:38]	<Ace2005>	i just updated to dapper and nvidia drivers won't work, i'm using nv at the moment
[none]	[06:38]	<tristanmike>	rendo, well, you can't burn a cd iso to a dvd if that's what your asking
[none]	[06:38]	<AlienX>	are there dapper dvd isos out?
[none]	[06:38]	<ompaul>	Ohzie, if you have ati or nividia you have to do that make ati work >>sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg<<
[none]	[06:38]	<jlmr>	hi
[none]	[06:38]	<jlmr>	i have a small problem
[positive]	[06:38]	<rendo>	I sure can. :P
[none]	[06:38]	<frank_>	Ademan: well I you choose your laptop with linux support in mind, it must be easier setting it up. If you have graphics, sound, network and mouse working out of the box (I'm it's doable) it would be easier
[positive]	[06:38]	<rendo>	It doesn't work though. :P
[positive]	[06:38]	<tristanmike>	rendo, touche :P
[none]	[06:38]	<hazart>	would it be possible to switch a debian machine to ubuntu with dist-upgrade?

[none]	[06:39]	<AlienX>	hazart, no you'll break stuff
[none]	[06:39]	<rendo>	OH well, download download download!
[none]	[06:39]	<frank_>	Ademan: although I must say I only tried Ubuntu on my desktop
[none]	[06:39]	<krazykit>	hazart: hrm, it used to be a supported migration path, but it might be easier to just reinstall
[none]	[06:39]	<hazart>	From 2.4 debian sarge to dapper drake LTS

[none]	[06:39]	<krazykit>	hazart: no, there's no supported path for that.
[none]	[06:39]	<soundray>	hazart: not with recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu
[none]	[06:39]	<hazart>	Bugger, it's a very hard machine to reinstall.
[none]	[06:39]	<AlienX>	NoUse, thanks
[none]	[06:39]	<Soir>	hmm, does ubuntu have XGL anywhere yet?
[none]	[06:39]	<jlmr>	now, my question is, if i backup my MBR using dd (446 bytes etc), can ntldr use it to boot ubuntu?
[none]	[06:39]	<wastrel>	!tell jlmr about fixmbr
[none]	[06:39]	<NoUse>	!tell Soir about xgl
[none]	[06:39]	<Ng>	Soir: it's in universe. see #ubuntu-xgl
[none]	[06:39]	<xcomputerman>	oh, there are dvd images?
[none]	[06:39]	<xcomputerman>	crap.
[none]	[06:39]	<hazart>	But ubuntu seems worth it.
[none]	[06:39]	<DBO>	thanks ompaul =P
[none]	[06:39]	<xcomputerman>	wish i'd known
[none]	[06:40]	<DBO>	Soir, #ubuntu-xgl
[none]	[06:40]	<DBO>	oops, Ng beat me
[none]	[06:40]	<krazykit>	jlmr: there IS a way to make ntldr do it, but afaik, it's a pain in the butt.  i'm sure it's around on google though
[none]	[06:40]	<Soir>	mm, just that it does; that's what I was asking ^^
[positive]	[06:40]	<hazart>	the others laughed at me when i installed the first ubuntu server, but look whos laughing now :) LTS is great!

[none]	[06:40]	<ompaul>	xcomputerman, can you auto replace any swear words your likley to utter in irc with something more friendly please
[none]	[06:40]	<krazykit>	hazart: if you try to do that, i'll guarantee breakage.  but go ahead and try!  it'll be fun.
[none]	[06:40]	<troytroy>	hi need pkg to create virtual cdrom
[none]	[06:40]	<DBO>	mada, try mad tech support rush
[none]	[06:40]	<hazart>	krazykit: Hehe, no, it's an important production system.
[none]	[06:40]	<xcomputerman>	ompaul: err, what?
[none]	[06:41]	<troytroy>	like daemon tools in windows
[none]	[06:41]	<DBO>	troytroy, you mean an ISO?
[none]	[06:41]	<mada>	DBO: fair enough
[none]	[06:41]	<jdmpike>	bummer - no nxserver support
[none]	[06:41]	<hazart>	krazykit: to bad we don't have a spare machine for seamless migration. We really need SATA support in it soon, and that reguires 2.6 kernel.
[none]	[06:41]	<neutrinomass>	I'm going to buy some PCI ethernet cards... any advice as to Linux compatability ?
[none]	[06:41]	<soundray>	xcomputerman: don't play dumb, I saw it too.
[none]	[06:41]	<troytroy>	yes and make images
[none]	[06:41]	<frank_>	troytroy: you can mount iso directly. Or you can google for cdemu for a virtual drive
[positive]	[06:41]	<mada>	DBO: i'll hang for a little bit and see if there is anything i can lend a hand at :)
[none]	[06:41]	<xcomputerman>	soundray: what did i say?
[none]	[06:41]	<rendo>	Hrm.
[none]	[06:41]	<rendo>	Is it quicker to go find a blank CD?
[negative]	[06:41]	<rendo>	Or is it quicker to download the DVD iso :/
[none]	[06:41]	<h3sp4wn>	jdmpike: sevas has repos for dapper of freenx
[none]	[06:41]	<hazart>	krazykit: and debian unstable is just not the same as dapper LTS.
[positive]	[06:42]	<soundray>	xcomputerman: I'm too posh and too lazy to repeat it to you. ;)
[none]	[06:42]	<mada>	rendo: find a blank cd

[none]	[06:42]	<h3sp4wn>	jdmpike: Only difference from the breezy one is ssh has to be bound to localhost also

[none]	[06:49]	<leonel>	DAPPER  ROCKS !!!!
[none]	[06:49]	<to0om>	hi folks, a question: why does the battery-panel in dapper always notify me that there are only 3 minutes left although the battery is almost full?

[none]	[06:49]	<to0om>	i use dapper soundray
[none]	[06:50]	<tRSS>	how can I change my sources.list for dapper drake?
[none]	[06:50]	<pike__>	AskHL: when it first boots up type 'server' and hit enter. once the install is done it will drop you at a login prompt; login and type sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
[none]	[06:50]	<mada>	this is a tad on the chaotic side ...
[none]	[06:50]	<soundray>	to0om: was it working before?

[none]	[06:50]	<anto9us>	ro, you can have a nested login if that would be prettier
[none]	[06:50]	<to0om>	yes, with hoary and breezy soundray

[none]	[07:05]	<mikedep333>	hey guys, if I add the universe components (to dapper), will it update official ubuntu packages with newer versions from universe?
[none]	[07:05]	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: if 2.6.15 supports the hardware, then Dapper probably does too.  yes, probably outside of here.  mostly newbs here.
[none]	[07:05]	<ompaul>	sorush20, ask in -offtopic or look on the website
[none]	[07:06]	<mikedep333>	I'm worried that it will replace stable packages with less stable ones

[none]	[07:06]	<BigMonkey>	mjmac: Pardon my ignorance.  How can I see if 2.6.15 supports the hardware?
[none]	[07:06]	<mjmac>	BigMonkey: you can always just grab the kernel source and look at the docs/config options
[none]	[07:06]	<DBO>	mikedep333, universe is relatively stable and does not afaik replace any normal core packages
[positive]	[07:06]	<avarab>	What will I notice once apt-get dist-upgrade -y finishes? I.e. what's new besides newer packages?;)

[none]	[07:07]	<soundray>	nollidj: ^^
[none]	[07:07]	<anto9us>	mikedep333, that only happens if you add repositories not belongning to the release which universe and multiverse do, you can pin versions if you add other repositories though

[none]	[07:10]	<DBO>	wasabi, just renice your sshd to a lower value

[none]	[07:14]	<Bluesman>	i have a user in my system and he can't access updates...... i need help...!!!!!
[none]	[07:14]	<dieman>	sweetnjguy29: since it takes a hash of every part of the file and compares it to the torrent you have
[none]	[07:14]	<DBO>	sweetnjguy29, ok, what is going wrong with the cd?

[none]	[07:14]	<anto9us>	Bluesman, only those in admin group can install updates
[none]	[07:15]	<DBO>	Bluesman, what do you mean he cant access updates?  only root or someone with sudo powers can update the system
[none]	[07:15]	<buzzed>	still takes a long time to load metacity
[none]	[07:15]	<NoUse>	Bluesman you mean they can't run update-manager?
[none]	[07:15]	<Guest971>	hi, does the install cd will contain both, the desktop and server installations ?
[positive]	[07:15]	<sweetnjguy29>	I burnt the CD using the ISO option on Nero Express (I also burnt two previous CDs using a different ISO burning program)

[none]	[07:16]	<buzzed>	what is this Ekiga?

[none]	[07:22]	<buzzed>	encompass: skype is better?
[none]	[07:22]	<kermitX_>	Orion_1: desktop is livecd and gui installer - alternate is like the old text installer.
[none]	[07:22]	<frenkel>	Orion_1: and it installs a lot faster then the text-based version

[none]	[07:27]	<Orion_1>	seems easier
[none]	[07:27]	<ketsugi>	Ubuntu doesn't seem to like the dash in the URL

[none]	[07:27]	<dmesg>	hi
[none]	[07:27]	<NoUse>	zjohnson you only need to use dist-upgrade, upgrade and dist-upgrade is redundant
[none]	[07:27]	<Avian00>	can somebody tell me if the dapper repositories are down?
[none]	[07:27]	<Bugs>	ketsugi:  yes, remove the hypen and it works

[none]	[07:28]	<kermitX_>	krpano: double check /etc/apt/sources.list and ensure the extra repos are enabled.

[none]	[07:28]	<lastnode>	SurfnKid, fsck?
[none]	[07:28]	<ketsugi>	dirt. and dirt-. are different sites
[none]	[07:28]	<CHodapp>	Ok, here's a common question. How are desktop, server, and alternate different?
[none]	[07:28]	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, the need for defrag is a sign of a badly written filesystem
[none]	[07:28]	<Bugs>	ketsugi:  try this:::: ping dirt.blogspot.com
[none]	[07:28]	<r0xoR>	i.e. fat32 or hfs
[none]	[07:28]	<CHodapp>	r0xoR, that's what I tell people, but they keep on using those FSes...
[none]	[07:28]	<zeelot>	Amaranth: no error msg
[none]	[07:28]	<ketsugi>	Yeah, if I do that I just get the blogspot IP
[none]	[07:28]	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  does ubuntu have a heartbeat like NT? I just want my hard drive to last
[none]	[07:28]	<ketsugi>	if I try to ping dirt-. I get unknown host
[none]	[07:28]	<Amaranth>	Bugs: that site works but he is saying the site with a - really exists

[none]	[07:29]	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  the hard drive has a heartbeat on NT, just wondering if ubuntu runs on that principle,
[none]	[07:29]	<whiter>	doesnt ubuntu access the hard drive less than windows?
[none]	[07:29]	<CHodapp>	"""heartbeat""?"
[none]	[07:30]	<whiter>	because of the way it uses memory
[none]	[07:30]	<SurfnKid>	r0xoR,  I am no more NT on this box at least
[none]	[07:30]	<Bugs>	ketsugi:  no, it does not seem to exist.  Only the dirt.blogspot comes up in my browser

[none]	[07:30]	<ketsugi>	I'm trying to figure out why Ubuntu doesn't want to (or Debian, I guess)
[none]	[07:30]	<SurfnKid>	ok
[none]	[07:30]	<CHodapp>	I have 2.4 GB drives that have been taking a daily beating for 8 years and not died
[none]	[07:31]	<r0xoR>	SurfnKid, hello! i already toldya... you don't need to defrag in ubuntu... that alone should save your hard drive some wear and tear
[none]	[07:31]	<Bugs>	ketsugi: Oh...well maybe windows resolves that URL into a proper URL ?
[none]	[07:31]	<CHodapp>	Usually if drives are about to die, you can hear the bearings going out

[none]	[07:32]	<zeelot>	anto9us:yes you got it

[none]	[07:33]	<Amaranth>	tRSS: basically everywhere your current sources.list says breezy you change that to say dapper instead

[none]	[07:33]	<Amaranth>	MrObvious: not without captiventfs

[none]	[07:33]	<r0xoR>	spikeh, what kind of graphics card
[none]	[07:33]	<CHodapp>	I have a DWL-G510 that I use with Atheros . . . guess I'll find out if Ubuntu likes to read it
[none]	[07:34]	<zeelot>	auto9us: people from my country's community told me that sort hardware will encounter this kind of problem, that after upgraded from breezy to Dapper some hardware will malfunctioned

[none]	[07:34]	<spikeh>	but this time, it doesn't
[none]	[07:34]	<Amaranth>	MrObvious: It's mostly safe and no, you can't apt-get it.
[none]	[07:34]	<r0xoR>	MrObvious, you'll probably either have to install a module or compile the kernel yourself with NTFS write support
[none]	[07:34]	<funman>	hi
[positive]	[07:34]	<MrObvious>	Ok just asking :)
[none]	[07:34]	<KhZillu>	anyone have troubles with ndiswrapper and broadcom wifi? because I am.

[none]	[07:35]	<Amaranth>	r0xoR: Captive uses FUSE, no kernel recompile needed. Just a download and install script.

[none]	[07:35]	<anto9us>	zeelot, ok, the AP may have it's essid hidden and may not be issuing more leases, check its config
[none]	[07:35]	<rob_>	So my question is, where do I type this? Do I bring up a console? And how do I bring one up?

[none]	[07:36]	<SurfnKid>	Greyscale, not sure if that'll help or if its for the 6.06 but its worth a look
[none]	[07:36]	<h3sp4wn>	KhZillu: Yes but you need to install the firmware (using fwcutter) see the brc43xx page on the wiki
[none]	[07:36]	<Amaranth>	spikeh: ctrl-alt-f1
[none]	[07:36]	<zeelot>	anto9us: it's kinda impossible cuz my AP's Essid is at all time broadcasting....

[none]	[07:57]	<DavidJaq>	I'm having a horrible time getting Ubuntu to work on my computer... no matter what I tried I couldn't get my old computer to boot from CD, so I had to take out the hard drive and put it into my other computer, install Dapper Drake, and then put the drive back in my old computer
[none]	[07:57]	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: while edgy is in development it will have 2.15
[none]	[07:57]	<gnomefreak>	Amaranth: thats if it is build with the dapper libs
[none]	[07:57]	<Amaranth>	h4ch3r: because 2.15 becomes 2.16 when it's stable
[none]	[07:57]	<mcphail>	hazart: the finer point of apt-get are lost on me. You could script a hack to replace /etc/apt/sources.list temporarily with the repos you want to use
[none]	[07:57]	<h4ch3r>	Amaranth:
[none]	[07:57]	<jlmr>	grub, and the find /boot/grub/stage1 tells me it is installed in hd0,4 but i think it is in MBR, or am not getting anything?
[none]	[07:57]	<PHiSQuaRE>	jesus, the ubuntu installer is FAR better than the FC5 installer, I have to say I'm quite impressed so far....
[none]	[07:57]	<hazart>	h4ch3r: yes, but you can select the edgy sources before it's stable, and get it that way.

[none]	[08:19]	<midna>	Avian: i didn't see your question i was afk what did you ask?
[positive]	[08:19]	<Avian00>	the only logical explination is that the repositories are down, can somebody confirm this?
[none]	[08:19]	<Lynoure>	rekrutacja: I might remember wrong, but I read that one needs to remove mention of the network interfaces (apart from loopback) from /etc/network/interfaces. Did that, after runnung the interfaces down. And it worked.
[none]	[08:19]	<dxdemetriou>	"The gksudo ""update-manager -d"" is making correct upgrade? I have read that the update-manager will force to Dapper without the -d."
[none]	[08:19]	<rukuartic>	sinbad444: Eh.... linux was built to be server sized. So if someuser logged on and decided to reboot, it could cause a lot of problems.
[none]	[08:19]	<scifi>	"can i just get some confirmation from someone that i need to replace all ""breezy"" references with ""dapper"" in my sources.list for sudo apt-get dist-upgrade to work ?"

[none]	[08:20]	<r0xoR>	i've installed a lot of custom stuff in my breezy install: custom kernel compile, out of kernel-tree modules and FF1.5
[none]	[08:20]	<mjr>	soundray, incorrect. It will change the effective gid to the gid of the owner group
[none]	[08:20]	<r0xoR>	will an upgrade to dapper overwrite all that?
[none]	[08:20]	<rukuartic>	soundray: Ooof you kinda lost me on the syntax...
[none]	[08:20]	<Avian00>	I guess I can take that as I'm not the only having this problem
[none]	[08:20]	<dxdemetriou>	dsas: I know, but the update-manager don't give me the choice yet
[none]	[08:20]	<midna>	Avian: you are not
[none]	[08:20]	<sorush20>	hi
[none]	[08:20]	<soundray>	rukuartic: it was wrong anyway, as mjr pointed out
[none]	[08:21]	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: Does it work with the '-d' ?
[none]	[08:21]	<midna>	Avian: try using synaptic?
[none]	[08:21]	<Avian00>	ok.  thanks midna
[none]	[08:21]	<dxdemetriou>	dsas: yes
[none]	[08:21]	<ak7>	ok, I'm checking the md5sum of an iso in a terminal, and i'm getting different values for the same file, each time I run it

[none]	[08:21]	<rukuartic>	"mjr: Would you happen to know how I could allow one user to run ""reboot"" without using sudo?"
[none]	[08:21]	<Amaranth>	Avian00: your mirror might be overloaded

[none]	[08:21]	<midna>	?
[none]	[08:22]	<Avian00>	Amaranth: how can I specify a different mirror?  I've been searching google and ubuntuforms for that without any luck
[none]	[08:22]	<onkarshinde>	scifi: You can comment that. And if you have dapper CD then do 'susdo apt-cdrom add'
[none]	[08:22]	<flask->	r0xor: ran update-manager -d, it did its thing and said it had to reboot. rebooted and no upgrade had taken place.
[negative]	[08:22]	<ak7>	midna: bad memory can do that? :/
[none]	[08:22]	<Simthumb>	Hi I had a few questions about Ubuntu
[none]	[08:22]	<Amaranth>	midna: no, but you can use the CD to do a dist-upgrade
[none]	[08:22]	<dxdemetriou>	dsas: I have the cy.archive.ubuntu... It will be this the reason?
[none]	[08:22]	<sinbad444>	haha yeah but im only getting like 3-5Kbps !!
[positive]	[08:22]	<rukuartic>	midna: If you shut down and put the CD in, you might be able to boot from CD and install that way :)
[none]	[08:22]	<mjr>	rukuartic, I would recommend sudo anyway
[none]	[08:22]	<r0xoR>	flask-, you have to use dist-upgrade
[none]	[08:22]	<xeta>	HAPPY DAPPER DAY!
[none]	[08:22]	<flask->	r0xor: then I tried to manually run dist-upgrade and it complained about all my xorg-* packages needing to be removed... so I let it
[none]	[08:22]	<xiko>	hmm just upgraded it to dapper, everything working right
[none]	[08:22]	<Amaranth>	Avian00: you have to manually edit your sources.list
[none]	[08:22]	<dsas>	dxdemetriou: Possibly, not all mirrors will update as quick as others.
[none]	[08:22]	<midna>	rukuartic: cd kills my display.. as soon as it finishes booting the stupid screen goes black
[none]	[08:22]	<rekrutacja>	Lynoure: hmmm, i use pcmcia atheros card (madwifi driver) and remember that i have to edit sth in this file to get it running
[none]	[08:22]	<mjr>	rukuartic, but you could make it 4750 and owned by a group that can execute it as root
[none]	[08:22]	<rukuartic>	mjr: Hmm. Lemme look on editing sudoers file...
[none]	[08:22]	<r0xoR>	flask-, did you read and or follow any instructions? and if so which ones?
[none]	[08:22]	<JyZky>	nouse

[none]	[08:23]	<midna>	Amaranth: thank you.. i might resort to that, but i would really like to just get a vanilla install
[none]	[08:23]	<madmike>	jlmr, what does the /boot/grub/menu.lst look like (for the windows part anyway) ?
[negative]	[08:23]	<ak7>	midna: well, thanks... not sure about the status of my warranty, that's all :(

[none]	[08:48]	<FunnyLookinHat>	Raskall, wait...  so you're just installing a server for them?  then use burned CDs.   : )
[none]	[08:48]	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Yep
[none]	[08:48]	<hazart>	Is there a way to rebuild all modules that was made with module-assistant when a new kernel gets installed? If not, automatic updates could make the system boot a new kernel, without AFS modules installed.
[none]	[08:48]	<ben42>	is it a known problem?
[negative]	[08:48]	<kenni>	Does new ubuntu support nvidia geforce 7900gt graphics card?  (The doc at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia doesn't do the trick - the driver fails to recognice the card apparently - even claiming the card is of ATI brand in the xorg.conf!).
[none]	[08:48]	<Booo>	dsas which is better?
[none]	[08:48]	<dsas>	jayrod06: People have.
[positive]	[08:48]	<nexus10>	soundray: about 3+ minutes to connect :-(
[none]	[08:48]	<FunnyLookinHat>	Sounds like you should custom build an OEM type CD anyways
[none]	[08:48]	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: And did you order the LiveCD by mail?
[none]	[08:48]	<sally_>	shachaf: I've used network-manager applet before and I thought it showed a list of available access points when you click on it.  when I click on this icon it doesnt show a list of access points, it just lets me configure the interface through the ubuntu network-admin, am I missing something?
[none]	[08:48]	<rendo>	How do you do that 3d moving of the desktop in Dapper?

[none]	[08:48]	<no0ke>	!rc
[none]	[08:48]	<ubotu>	To Upgrade from RC to final, just: sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[08:48]	<rukuartic>	Raskall: They have the images to stamp ont he CD, just print them out and put them on yourself
[none]	[08:48]	<Simthumb>	rukuartic: Any idea how long it really takes? (they say 4-6 weeks,I just ordered it yesterday)
[none]	[08:49]	<Raskall>	FunnyLookinHat: Customers often like a physical product they can touch and that looks good in their shelf.
[none]	[08:49]	<FunnyLookinHat>	kenni, the 8756 driver (newest) is the only one that supports it
[none]	[08:49]	<dsas>	Booo: It depends, alternative is better for OEMs, server installs, RAID. Desktop is better if you want to try first, or want to install using a graphical installer.

[none]	[09:04]	<ucordes>	pls
[none]	[09:04]	<soundray>	kane777: while it's still downloading you can safely interrupt.
[none]	[09:04]	<kenni>	FunnyHat_Work, we got new nvidia-glx package ...
[none]	[09:04]	<eugman>	stan, I THINK it MAY mean you can have a lamp server install mode from the cd. I MAY be wrong.
[none]	[09:05]	<DBO>	ucordes, the alternate 6.06 install CD is a traditional text based installer for ubuntu
[none]	[09:05]	<eugman>	ucordes, Alternate == Text installer.
[none]	[09:05]	<soundray>	ucordes: they are for text mode installs in case of graphics difficulties.
[none]	[09:05]	<vermoos>	scifi: does it look any different? do you have to restart?
[none]	[09:05]	<kane777>	soundray, well that's my question... should I??

[none]	[09:05]	<soundray>	kane777: if you want to save on download time, you could. I personally would just let it work overnight.
[none]	[09:05]	<basvg>	aja, the restricted formats page

[none]	[09:06]	<Shutdown>	my ati graphics card is running at 640x480. I have tried installing the drivers, but I can't do it through the shell. If anyone could tell me what to do that would just make my day.

[none]	[09:07]	<Sub>	?
[none]	[09:07]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Shutdown, sorry, using shell w/ ubuntu is not good   ; )
[none]	[09:07]	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: why not use the shell?? (Just out of curiosity)
[none]	[09:07]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Shutdown, check the msg from ubuto
[none]	[09:07]	<nnz>	but it will work ?
[none]	[09:07]	<soundray>	nnz: yes, that's tight. It will probably boot eventually, though.
[none]	[09:07]	<shachaf>	Hardware acceleration works again! I had to boot the -386 kernel, rather than the -k7.
[none]	[09:07]	<aedwards323>	it said to report it as a bug, which I just might do

[none]	[09:07]	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: yes
[none]	[09:07]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, Ubuntu is designed to not sure terminal/console to make it more user friendly.  Everything can/should be done through synaptic using .deb packages from repositories
[none]	[09:07]	<kenni>	I run default ubuntu ... I followed wiki .. why does not X detect the nvidia 7900gt_
[none]	[09:08]	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: its fast
[none]	[09:08]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, ever used Debian?
[none]	[09:08]	<aedwards323>	its not installed

[none]	[09:08]	<soundray>	"sally_: what exactly does it do in the way of ""checking""?"
[none]	[09:08]	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: No, but I see no problems with apt-get.
[none]	[09:08]	<johnm1019>	I hear some jive that supposedly it was going to be really easy to install XGL in dapper -- is this the case?
[none]	[09:08]	<FunnyHat_Work>	dsas, hah!
[none]	[09:08]	<BleedingThrough>	even on a crappy computer?
[none]	[09:08]	<dsas>	aedwards323:Try installing it first then upgrading.
[none]	[09:08]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, ahh, well apt-get is just as good
[none]	[09:08]	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: or aptitude for that matter. since synaptic is a overlay of that
[none]	[09:08]	<jhenn>	johnm1019: yes apt-get install xgl

[none]	[09:08]	<jhenn>	johnm1019: its a trap though
[none]	[09:08]	<eugman>	Kenni, Have you tried doing an xserver reconfigure to see if it can detect it properly now?
[none]	[09:08]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, what I meant was don't use binary installers whenever possible, use the apt-get ot get from official repos
[none]	[09:09]	<emark2k>	anyone familiar w/ PPC boot and partitioning?
[none]	[09:09]	<FunnyHat_Work>	Snake, right right.
[none]	[09:09]	<Snake>	FunnyHat_Work: ah, of course
[none]	[09:09]	<Fee^>	anyone else notice a bunch of apps gone from the program menus from Badger > Dapper?  gconf-edit, etc?
[none]	[09:09]	<kenni>	eugman, no, thanx for the idea man!
[none]	[09:09]	<jhenn>	emark2k: ppc doesn't need a /boot partition
[positive]	[09:09]	<johnm1019>	jhenn, what do you mean a trap :-\
[none]	[09:09]	<aedwards323>	it cant find it
[none]	[09:09]	<FunnyHat_Work>	<<AFK>>
[none]	[09:09]	<dsas>	Fee^: yeah, it was done purposefully
[none]	[09:09]	<jhenn>	johnm1019: non-free drivers
[positive]	[09:09]	<Snake>	"FunnyHat_Work: I thought you ment that as ""Never use shell"" as in, never at all :)"
[positive]	[09:09]	<scifi>	vermoos: another 55mins :P
[none]	[09:09]	<dsas>	aedwards323: Hmm, sorry, not sure then.
[none]	[09:09]	<johnm1019>	jhenn, as in they cost money or they aren't open source
[none]	[09:09]	<Fee^>	dsas: i figured...removing more bullets from the monkey's loaded guns
[positive]	[09:09]	<Fee^>	:)
[none]	[09:09]	<soundray>	emark2k: what you want to do will probably work. Just give it permission to subdivide that one partition.
[none]	[09:09]	<Fee^>	i'm a power-user, so it was no biggie
[none]	[09:09]	<jhenn>	johnm1019: free as in freedom
[positive]	[09:09]	<Fee^>	i flex command line yo :)
[none]	[09:09]	<johnm1019>	jhenn, gotcha -- but they work?
[none]	[09:10]	<jhenn>	!tell johnm1019 about xgl
[positive]	[09:10]	<kirkunit>	whoa.. busy in here... i wonder why :)
[none]	[09:10]	<emark2k>	Jhenn and soundray, thank you very much
[none]	[09:10]	<vermoos>	scifi: i'd say about 40 -
[none]	[09:10]	<kenni>	eugman, how do you reconfigure in ubuntu?  (I tried dpkg-reconfigure)
[none]	[09:10]	<sally_>	soundray, it runs dosfsck, I can't find any console or file that shows exactly what it prints out
[positive]	[09:10]	<johnm1019>	jhenn, thanks for the info! :)
[none]	[09:10]	<basvg>	right, that worked. only problem now is that double-clicking on mp3's will fire up the wrong app (the movie player instead of the rhythm box thingy)
[none]	[09:10]	<scifi>	vermoos: terminal says 54mins for me
[none]	[09:10]	<Fee^>	yeah, i haven't figured out how to change the file associates for mp3 yet
[none]	[09:10]	<Fee^>	i want xmms to be the default
[none]	[09:11]	<fatalblu>	i want a pony
[none]	[09:11]	<basvg>	Fee^: shouldn't be too hard... I'll fidle with it, hang on
[none]	[09:11]	<ZeromusMog>	Hello, is this the place to ask? I am not understanding how I'm supposed to setup wifi in Dapper
[positive]	[09:11]	<basvg>	fatalblu: my little pony ;) ?
[none]	[09:11]	<eugman>	kenni I'm pretty sure it's dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg . May want to try dpkg-configure if that doesn't work. It's something like that.
[none]	[09:11]	<dsas>	Fee^: right click on an mp3
[none]	[09:11]	<Fee^>	since the default file types thingie seems to have been trimmed in dapper as well
[none]	[09:11]	<jhenn>	johnm1019: please don't give up your freedom for little effects
[none]	[09:11]	<ZeromusMog>	I can see it in my network configuration but i can't figure out how to scan for networks or connect to anything
[none]	[09:11]	<fatalblu>	basvg: more like Barbie Horse Adventure!

[none]	[09:11]	<basvg>	afk, fiddling with mp3-settings
[none]	[09:11]	<jhenn>	johnm1019: xgl is not essential but its nice i admit

[none]	[09:12]	<Fee^>	Dsas: yeah, i have xmms there...but i'm talking double-click action
[none]	[09:12]	<BleedingThrough>	6.06 much better than 5.10?
[none]	[09:12]	<Snake>	BleedingThrough: yes
[none]	[09:12]	<fatalblu>	Snake: either that or invest in Chloroform
[none]	[09:12]	<revmouse>	BleedingThrough, yes
[none]	[09:12]	<ZeromusMog>	I even installed kwifi manager but it's acting very strangely
[none]	[09:12]	<PHiSQuaRE>	jhenn, and how much time is enough time?
[none]	[09:12]	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: try it geeze there is a livecd or if your on dial up shipit
[none]	[09:13]	<jhenn>	BleedingThrough: or wait for reviews
[none]	[09:13]	<soundray>	sally_: that's definitely not the planned behavior. Do you mount the partition routinely in Ubuntu?
[none]	[09:13]	<iapx8088>	time for dapper
[positive]	[09:13]	<PHiSQuaRE>	I can't say I'm very patient :)
[none]	[09:13]	<iapx8088>	let's go.
[none]	[09:13]	<jhenn>	PHiSQuaRE: a couple days you know
[none]	[09:13]	<dsas>	Fee^: if you right click-> properties -> open with then you should be able to select xmms. That'll change the default mime type handler for all files of that mime type
[none]	[09:13]	<kirkunit>	anyone installed the avahi zeroconf daemon yet? works great for streaming music over a network to rhythmbox.
[none]	[09:13]	<sally_>	soundray, it gets mounted by default

[none]	[09:13]	<agorf>	hello. i go to adjust date + time and when i check the box to sync the clock i am asked to install ntp support. i choose ok and nothing happens. is this a bug?
[positive]	[09:13]	<Fee^>	dsas: and if it doesn't? :)
[none]	[09:13]	<jhenn>	PHiSQuaRE: why remove sound-juicer anyway do you need disk space?
[none]	[09:13]	<sally_>	soundray, I mean, it gets mounted at boot
[none]	[09:13]	<yaramaz>	hi friends   i have a toshiba satellite l10 laptop but ubuntu isn't showing my battery how  i fix it?
[negative]	[09:13]	<dsas>	Fee^: http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/bugs
[none]	[09:13]	<soundray>	sally_: did you notice any errors at umount time when you shut down?
[none]	[09:13]	<coco_>	xlack
[none]	[09:14]	<kirkunit>	yaramaz: are you running dapper?
[negative]	[09:14]	<ZeromusMog>	I'm a little dissapointed. I'm excited that the new Ubuntu can find my wireless card out of the box, and I heard it was delayed mostly for wireless support... so why isn't there a wifi manager :(
[none]	[09:14]	<Frem>	yaramaz, have you added the battery applet to the panel?
[none]	[09:14]	<charle97>	should i go for rieserfs?
[negative]	[09:14]	<nnz>	just went blank after booting nautils :/ guess wont work on 128 ram

[none]	[09:14]	<sally_>	soundray, no
[none]	[09:14]	<dsas>	ZeromusMog: That is _not_ why it was delayed.
[none]	[09:14]	<MrObvious>	!tell MrObvious about ndiswrapper
[none]	[09:14]	<jhenn>	nnz: xubuntuy
[none]	[09:14]	<yaramaz>	no i m using 5.10 ubuntu
[none]	[09:14]	<PHiSQuaRE>	jhenn, I don't need it so why keep it?
[none]	[09:14]	<dsas>	ZeromusMog: Try install network-manager and nm-applet
[none]	[09:14]	<Shutdown>	i cannot get the package to open in the package manager
[none]	[09:14]	<jhenn>	PHiSQuaRE: because its not bothering you
[none]	[09:14]	<iapx8088>	mmh it's going
[none]	[09:15]	<iapx8088>	let's hope, I have too much of work in this installation
[positive]	[09:15]	<ZeromusMog>	though to be fair, the liveCD/installer is impressive and sexy as all hell :)
[none]	[09:15]	<yaramaz>	no i havent added the battery applet to the panel
[none]	[09:15]	<yaramaz>	how  i do?
[positive]	[09:15]	<wastrel>	ZeromusMog:  sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces  :] 
[none]	[09:15]	<scifi>	im thinking of getting a cheap laptop, wud ubuntu run ok on one? (detect onboard graphics, battery power, wifi card etc)
[none]	[09:15]	<kirkunit>	yaramaz: well I'm not sure about the nature of your problem, but I know that Dapper has vastly in improved power management.
[none]	[09:15]	<agorf>	scifi, i have artifacts on my laptop
[none]	[09:15]	<soundray>	sally_: fsck is run on boot if the filesystem has the dirty flag. Perhaps you can reset the dirty flag by running dosfsck -a on the filesystem from within Ubuntu.
[none]	[09:15]	<PHiSQuaRE>	ZeromusMog, I agree, it's quite impressive and sexilicious
[none]	[09:15]	<sally_>	soundray, my /etc/fstab had 0 1 for the last two fields for the vfat partitions, I changed them to 0 0
[none]	[09:15]	<Kronoz>	use vim over vi
[none]	[09:15]	<sally_>	soundray, ok I will try that

[none]	[09:20]	<DavyO>	hello ppl
[none]	[09:20]	<dsas>	ktogias: Its completly up to you, though compiling it yourself may cause problems when you update ubuntu.
[none]	[09:21]	<Frem>	ZeromusMog, if you want network manager, you'll need to install it & the gnome applet via apt-get, then comment out everything having to do with our wifi card in /etc/network/interfaces and reboot

[none]	[09:21]	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: maybe your burn went wrong. Run the check CD option from the boot menu.
[none]	[09:21]	<eugman>	sylvan, I'm assuming these are automatically mounted?

I don't know anything about x servers :).   When I rebooted I got a message telling the xserver could not be started, probably due to a configuration problem.  I would be grateful if somebody could walk me through fixing my x server config files.

[none]	[09:23]	<agorf>	dsas, thanks!
[none]	[09:23]	<eugman>	Sylvan, Well I only know what I know I'm afraid. There may be an easy way but all I know is editing the fstab file which controls how the volumes are mounted.

[none]	[09:24]	<ZeromusMog>	charle97: installing Ubuntu is easier than windows, imo.
[none]	[09:24]	<mikeyyyy>	so whil i am installing it, i twill ask me if i want to do a dual install?
[none]	[09:24]	<sylvan>	eugman, I just figured that if they show my volumes on the desktop (without asking) there should be an easy way to access them, seems like every single volume will always have this problem for all users...
[none]	[09:24]	<charle97>	zeromusmog, i disagree
[none]	[09:24]	<eugman>	Silent_al, The link in the title should have a torrent for xubuntu I think.

[none]	[09:26]	<jah_raztah>	i'm already on dapper but i have the beta version of xubuntu now i wish to switch to ubuntu so i downloaded the dapper cd and would now like to use that cd to install ubuntu-desktop but it will only allow me to use the repositories... how can i set it to use the cd-rom?
[none]	[09:26]	<mikeyyyy>	also is it easy to install a game like the linux version of americas army?
[negative]	[09:26]	<ZeromusMog>	Problem is the few things that don't work aren't just a matter of downloading a driver installer :(

[none]	[09:26]	<harrison>	kane777 try running synaptic from the command line
[none]	[09:26]	<dsas>	kane777: Use alacarte menu editor
[none]	[09:26]	<eugman>	Sylvan, well that's the problem. Support for ntfs is rather weak. You could easily mess up something if you tried to write to such a volume. Reading them is safe but I'm guessing this might be like giving someone safety scissors so they don't cut themselves.
[none]	[09:27]	<ZeromusMog>	mikeyyyy: Windows is sadly king as far as games are concerned. Linux isn't really a good gaming platform unless all you play is tuxracer and quake, heh.

[none]	[09:27]	<soundray>	jah_raztah: you'll have to adapt the CD name in there.

[none]	[09:32]	<soundray>	jah_raztah: unmount it and run apt-get update again, see if that helps.
[none]	[09:33]	<profoX`>	wastrel: recommended minimal was 256
[none]	[09:33]	<eugman>	Dapper, nvidia, working, anyone?
[positive]	[09:33]	<wastrel>	profoX`:  minimal is slow :]   the livecd is loading the filesystem into RAM, so you won't have as much left over for running processes.
[none]	[09:33]	<profoX`>	wastrel: anyway... i think its mainly due to the disc load time...
[none]	[09:33]	<ScreaminIke>	where is the live cd?
[none]	[09:33]	<maddler>	eugman: me... but using drivers downloaded from nvidia...
[none]	[09:33]	<soundray>	ScreaminIke: it is now called Desktop CD
[none]	[09:33]	<profoX`>	ScreaminIke: the live cd got merged with the install cd in 6.06 I think
[none]	[09:34]	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, it worked for me in beta, testing tonight when I get home
[none]	[09:34]	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: Didn't work . Bringing up eth0 also clobbers up my ppp0 interface.
[none]	[09:34]	<ScreaminIke>	omg for realz? that is so cool
[none]	[09:34]	<btaranto>	hy. i have a dell xeon 64bits with 2 scsi ultra4 with raid1(megaraid). does anybody knows if cd-iso of ubuntu amd64 server detect this hardware(raid1(megarid)) on boot?
[none]	[09:34]	<ktogias>	Where can I find a how-to/wiki with instructions about installing and using xgl on dapper with ATI?
[none]	[09:34]	<dsas>	!tel ktogias about xgl
[negative]	[09:34]	<ubotu>	dsas: NO SPEAKE ENLISH! Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/
[none]	[09:34]	<jah_raztah>	soundray, no it doesn't
[none]	[09:34]	<eugman>	FunnyHat_Work, Do you have nvidia-glx installed?
[none]	[09:34]	<dsas>	!tell ktogias about xgl
[none]	[09:34]	<mikeyyyy>	yea i was confused by them calling it desktop cd too, they might want to add a note on the website or something
[none]	[09:34]	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, it should... but no guaruntees
[none]	[09:34]	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, yea.  and all of it's dependencies of course
[none]	[09:34]	<stjepan>	anyone tried dapper?
[none]	[09:35]	<indro>	!tell indro about xgl
[none]	[09:35]	<ltR20>	did drapper come out yet

[none]	[09:35]	<ltR20>	final version
[none]	[09:35]	<dsas>	stjepan: Just most the people in the room.
[none]	[09:35]	<rendo>	Is there anyone to have a script execute on startup?
[none]	[09:35]	<rendo>	anyway*
[none]	[09:35]	<stjepan>	"dsas, ""most"" ???"
[none]	[09:35]	<profoX`>	"wastrel: I have been waiting for more than 10 minutes now to get ""set time"" to open.. still not opened.. cpu usage itself isnt high, but the disk load is just 100% .. its just way too slow"
[none]	[09:35]	<ScreaminIke>	also... what is this ubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso
[none]	[09:35]	<yaramaz>	how  do  i compile the kernel on ubuntu 5.10?
[none]	[09:35]	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: When I bring ppp0 up though, I can ping 192.168.1.1 and 0.1, although this is probably irrelevant.
[none]	[09:35]	<eugman>	FunnyHat_Work, And I'm guessing I'm not supposed to have nvidia-settings anymore?
[none]	[09:35]	<shachaf>	rendo: Yes, there is. Do you mean on boot or on login?
[none]	[09:35]	<soundray>	jah_raztah: when you mount the CD, can you find the package? 'find /media/cdrom0 -name ubuntu-desktop\*.deb'
[none]	[09:35]	<rendo>	Login
[none]	[09:35]	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, yea, I don't think you need that one
[none]	[09:35]	<profoX`>	ltR20: yes it did 6.06 got released today
[none]	[09:35]	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ hum... the cd-iso of debian-31r0a amd64 dont detect my raid1.
[positive]	[09:35]	<wastrel>	profoX`:  yeah i dunno - get more ram :]   i don't really use the livecd
[none]	[09:35]	<eXistenZ>	Would anyone recommend me a practical md5 hash generator?
[none]	[09:35]	<FunnyHat_Work>	ubotu, tell eugman about nvidia
[none]	[09:35]	<dsas>	rendo: Yep you need to put the script in /etc/rc3.d and call it S99yourscriptname
[none]	[09:35]	<ScreaminIke>	what's the difference between that and the desktop?
[none]	[09:35]	<Tocano>	Where are the network configuration files in Ubuntu?  We had a DHCP failure during install, so figured we'd set that up after install ... but don't know where those files are in this one (6.06 LTS)
[none]	[09:35]	<FunnyHat_Work>	eugman, just follow that wiki for dapper instructions
[none]	[09:35]	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, I'm sorry, then. I don't know.
[none]	[09:35]	<mikeyyyy>	ok 20 minutes to download now 20 to burn lol grrrrrrr
[none]	[09:35]	<rendo>	Thank you.
[positive]	[09:36]	<profoX`>	wastrel: im going to install it on a 512 machine, its for a friend of me :)
[none]	[09:36]	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, try the i386 cd.
[none]	[09:36]	<kane777>	harrison, ok found the source of this messup... i uninstalled gnome... LOL...
[none]	[09:36]	<soundray>	ScreaminIke: it has a text-based installer
[none]	[09:36]	<ScreaminIke>	ahe
[none]	[09:36]	<shachaf>	rendo: No, wait.
[negative]	[09:36]	<foodcoman>	Anyone know why I get this error on my laptop CDROM.  Trying to enable DMA. http://kubuntu.pastebin.com/751965
[none]	[09:36]	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, all x64 software is fairly buggy still in the GNU/Linux world
[none]	[09:36]	<rendo>	Eh?
[none]	[09:36]	<dsas>	eXistenZ: md5sum
[none]	[09:36]	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: Ok, thanks. But normally it should be a matter of just activating eth0 and connecting to 192.168.0.1, right?
[none]	[09:36]	<dsas>	eXistenZ: It's there by default.
[none]	[09:36]	<shachaf>	rendo: What dsas said will run the script on boot.
[none]	[09:36]	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ i386 work. i have installed debian i386 with kernel 2.6.
[none]	[09:36]	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, yes, it should be. that or 192.168.1.1
[positive]	[09:36]	<rendo>	Okay, then how do I do it on login? :)
[none]	[09:36]	<mikeyyyy>	i thikn ubuntu has the best customer support
[none]	[09:37]	<profoX`>	wastrel: i use archlinux right now myself, but i must admit that ubuntu is coming along pretty well lately, im already looking forward to 6.10
[none]	[09:37]	<soundray>	jah_raztah: have you done an md5sum on the CD btw?
[negative]	[09:37]	<ZeromusDesktop>	Well, damn. Network Manager doesn't like to connect either. And still nothing that just scans =\
[none]	[09:37]	<shachaf>	rendo: To run in on login, either put it in your .Xsession or (if you're running GNOME) go to System->Preferences->Sessions->Startup Programs and add it there.
[none]	[09:37]	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, then it's the 64bit packages that are failing on you, rather than the total support for RAID.
[none]	[09:37]	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, oh, just remembered. have you tried setting that ip address as your gateway?
[none]	[09:37]	<T-CAN>	profoX` how do you like archlinux?
[negative]	[09:37]	<rendo>	I did that shachaf, and the script didn't run. :(
[none]	[09:37]	<FunnyHat_Work>	<<AFK AGAIN>>
[none]	[09:37]	<rendo>	In the session startup thing.
[none]	[09:37]	<redmonkey>	hi. i cannot play dvd movies. what libraries do i need for it except libdvdc**?
[none]	[09:37]	<shachaf>	rendo: You're sure?
[none]	[09:37]	<Trashcan>	my video card burned out, and i need to get my dapper box to a state where i can run sshd
[none]	[09:37]	<jah_raztah>	soundray, no i have not i download the the official torrent file from ubuntu website and once it finished downloading i burnt it
[none]	[09:37]	<rendo>	Yes.
[positive]	[09:37]	<skeltoac>	just installed update from breezy badger to dapper... gotta reboot! :)
[none]	[09:37]	<Trashcan>	is there a quick keystroke to get it to boot to console
[none]	[09:38]	<shachaf>	rendo: You might have to type the full path in, rather than just the name of the script.
[negative]	[09:38]	<dsas>	redmonkey: Have you saw http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats ?
[none]	[09:38]	<ltR20>	did drapper come out yet - final version.
[none]	[09:38]	<rendo>	I did that.
[none]	[09:38]	<dsas>	ltR20: yes
[none]	[09:38]	<Trashcan>	im driving with my eyes closed so no X
[none]	[09:38]	<ltR20>	Can i order the cds?
[none]	[09:38]	<Annie>	hey
[none]	[09:38]	<jah_raztah>	soundray you are right there is no package named ubuntu-desktop on the cdrom as well
[none]	[09:38]	<dsas>	ltR20: yes, they won't arrive for 4-6 weeks though
[none]	[09:38]	<Annie>	asl
[none]	[09:38]	<iNiku>	Trashcan: sshd can run even if X is running
[none]	[09:38]	<dsas>	ltR20: Maybe even longer
[none]	[09:38]	<eXistenZ>	dsas, Say I want to generate a md5 hash from a text, is it possible to do that with md5sum?
[none]	[09:38]	<redmonkey>	dsas: no, thank you for the link!
[none]	[09:38]	<iNiku>	Trashcan: you might not have sshd installed, though
[none]	[09:38]	<Trashcan>	i do
[none]	[09:38]	<Trashcan>	it's not set up to run at boot
[none]	[09:38]	<Trashcan>	hence the problem
[none]	[09:38]	<Trashcan>	so i need to jump to a console and run it
[none]	[09:39]	<dsas>	"eXistenZ: just do ""md5sum filename"""
[none]	[09:39]	<Trashcan>	but have to do so without being able to see
[none]	[09:39]	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: 192.168.0.1 or the 169.xxx addy? how do I set it as a gateway with dhcp ?
[none]	[09:39]	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ hum... what do you recommend? leave with i386 2.6?
[none]	[09:39]	<harrison>	anyone running compiz + aiglx with dapper release?
[none]	[09:39]	<T-CAN>	im off to upgrade to dapper
[none]	[09:39]	<T-CAN>	wish me luck
[none]	[09:39]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: best distribution i ever had... its abit harder to setup/configure, but once its running it works flawlessly, and you have so many options. pacman package manager look salot like apt-get and ABS is like gentoo's build system.
[none]	[09:39]	<eXistenZ>	dsas, the text is not in a file
[none]	[09:39]	<dsas>	harrison: see #ubuntu-xgl
[none]	[09:39]	<aedwards323>	how do you upgrade to dapper from command line
[none]	[09:39]	<aedwards323>	?????
[none]	[09:39]	<harrison>	thx
[none]	[09:39]	<dsas>	eXistenZ: Where is it?
[none]	[09:39]	<CHodapp>	Ok. Before someone else uses it offensively, I'll just scream it: JEWBUNTU
[none]	[09:39]	<bingo>	Hi, I try dapper today, it's very nice... do you know the name of the gtk theme of dapper? cause I want the same in my debian !
[none]	[09:39]	<shachaf>	rendo: Hmm.
[none]	[09:39]	<CHodapp>	There. Now it's dead.
[none]	[09:39]	<iNiku>	Trashcan: oh... ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a console, then log in and run sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
[none]	[09:39]	<nnz>	dapper wont boot on 128 megs of ram , after nautils done loading it just goes to blank screen n nothing.do server dapper have gui?
[none]	[09:39]	<Hoxzer>	How well does ubuntu support NTFS writing?
[none]	[09:39]	<dsas>	bingo: Human
[none]	[09:39]	<eXistenZ>	dsas, I just want to feed it a text, and it will convert it into md5 hash
[none]	[09:39]	<dsas>	Hoxzer: It doesn't
[none]	[09:39]	<T-CAN>	profoX` I really want to try archlinux out but I dont know if i can handle it
[none]	[09:39]	<iNiku>	Trashcan: sudo will probably ask for your password
[none]	[09:40]	<Hoxzer>	LOLLERSKATES
[none]	[09:40]	<shachaf>	rendo: Does the script work when you run it normally?
[none]	[09:40]	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ is the first time i play with 64bits arch.
[positive]	[09:40]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: do you have experience with linux ?
[none]	[09:40]	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, well if it isn't broken, don't fix it  ; )
[none]	[09:40]	<rendo>	ya
[none]	[09:40]	<Trashcan>	iniku: can i ctl-alt-f1 from x login screen?
[none]	[09:40]	<Hoxzer>	is there any way to enable it?
[none]	[09:40]	<neutrinomas1>	nnz: No, but the desktop should boot at least I think. It would be slow as hell, but bootable ...
[none]	[09:40]	<jah_raztah>	soundray, should i just forget about using the cd-rom and just use the repositories to install the packages?
[none]	[09:40]	<bingo>	dsas, do you know wher I can download it
[none]	[09:40]	<T-CAN>	a little but not much
[none]	[09:40]	<FunnyHat_Work>	btaranto, I'd stay away from the 64bit kernels , etc. for now
[none]	[09:40]	<shachaf>	rendo: Try adding some other program to the list and see if it starts on login.
[none]	[09:40]	<dsas>	eXistenZ: just type md5sum, then start writing, press ctrl+D when you've finished
[none]	[09:40]	<iNiku>	Trashcan: yes
[none]	[09:40]	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, the 192.168.0.1 address. I don't remeber exactly how to set something as a gateway, but I had to do it many moons ago with slackware. it's something like ifconfig -gateway 192.168.0.1, but don't quote me on that.
[none]	[09:40]	<rendo>	I have to run it in the terminal though.
[none]	[09:40]	<Trashcan>	awesome thanks
[none]	[09:40]	<MagusG>	is there any word on when a DVD release will be up?

[none]	[09:40]	<T-CAN>	profoX` I just started with it acouple weeks ago
[negative]	[09:40]	<rendo>	Gaim does already, so it works. I dunno why the script won't :/
[positive]	[09:40]	<ZeromusDesktop>	You know guys, I DO live in pretty close to Broadcom's offices, maybe I should go there and raise hell :)
[negative]	[09:40]	<eugman>	http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/ . Check it out.  It's a useful sorce of information.
[none]	[09:40]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: the #archlinux channel is friendly; but for beginners i wouldnt advise arch. why do you want to try out arch ?
[none]	[09:40]	<aedwards323>	!upgrade

[none]	[09:41]	<soundray>	jah_raztah: depends... if you're paying per MB, I would check the md5sums first (on the image file AND on the CD)
[none]	[09:41]	<T-CAN>	profoX` I really just want to learn what makes it tick and Ive heard that building the system yourself helps you understand a lot about it

[none]	[09:42]	<mgalvin>	wow, 1000+ people... hello world!
[none]	[09:42]	<soundray>	jah_raztah: if you're only concerned about your impact on the web, I think you can safely assume it's okay to download a gig or so.
[none]	[09:42]	<asdx>	bah
[none]	[09:42]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: then maybe gentoo would be good for you, but it is too time consuming and even harder to setup. you have to compile everything from source, and frankly, it isnt that much faster than archlinux (the same kinda) plus in the end you just use portage to compile packages.. that wont teach you anything either
[positive]	[09:42]	<neutrinomas1>	Frem: No luck with that :( Thanks anyway, I'll just lurk in here until somebody helps me :)

[none]	[09:42]	<vermoos>	scifi: ok! it needed a restart, and gives a good first impression. its a nicer look and feel for defo, and matplotlib is in the package manager by default.
[none]	[09:42]	<soundray>	rackerz: don't use automatix!

[none]	[09:42]	<RandolphCarter>	rackerz: you can do it yourself then save your history as a script
[none]	[09:42]	<ZeromusDesktop>	profoX`, you DO learn a lot from Gentoo. Not how to compile packages though, heh
[none]	[09:42]	<jah_raztah>	no it's only around 303 mb that i need to download since i have all the xorg and other gtk2 libs and things from xubuntu already
[none]	[09:42]	<eugman>	Rackerz, yes mainly because it'll be easily revertable and because you'll be smarter for it.
[positive]	[09:42]	<Frem>	neutrinomas1, ok. good luck with that. :-)
[none]	[09:42]	<dsas>	!tell rackerz about easyubuntu

[none]	[09:43]	<shammy>	how's the wireless compatability on drake?
[none]	[09:43]	<T-CAN>	profoX` I figure the only way to really figure everything out is by jumping in head first. Plus I am on a computer that I just threw together and dont really care about so it would be that big of a deal if anything got messed up.
[none]	[09:43]	<btaranto>	FunnyHat_Work_ if ubuntu detect all of my hardwares? is better i leave with i386 2.6?
[none]	[09:43]	<soundray>	rackerz: just tell easyubuntu to leave your totem alone.

[positive]	[09:44]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: sure, but beginners will enjoy ubuntu better i think :) although my first real distribution was debian too, when it still had the bad/uneasy installer
[none]	[09:44]	<Andy101>	is there anyway of removing an applet from a panel without actually starting gnome, the gxmms applet keeps causing gnome to crash when starting so I want to remove it
[none]	[09:44]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: and i liked it
[none]	[09:44]	<soundray>	mikeyyyy: who said that?
[none]	[09:44]	<scifi>	vermoos: whats matplotlib ?
[none]	[09:44]	<T-CAN>	profoX` ya, I am on ubuntu right now and I have learned a lot but I feel I could learn so much more by using arch

[none]	[09:45]	<arcade>	neutrinomas1: shoot.
[none]	[09:45]	<scifi>	vermoos: im only into 3D graphics, looking forward to using latest version of Blender that comes with dapper
[none]	[09:45]	<soundray>	arcade: it's so easy to upgrade to a new release -- why bother with old ones.

[none]	[09:46]	<malv>	updates tend to break things
[none]	[09:46]	<profoX`>	T-CAN: well arch will learn you about how linux works better than most distros, because you have to edit alot of files by hand, configuration files that tell your system what to do and where to look
[none]	[09:47]	<dsas>	malv: It's fine as long as you have the ubuntu-* metapackages installed
[positive]	[09:47]	<arcade>	soundray: New releases doesn't come every week ;)  I'm thinking in the way of.. an _official_ way to upgrade - without any conflicts - the kernel to the newest release, KDE to the newest release, and so forth.  Those things should be made readily available for the pervious 'stable' releases.

I installed the ethernet card, connected it to the router; this part is probably OK since all leds on the router light up as expected.

[none]	[09:49]	<neutrinomas1>	"arcade: Quite possibly, I'm not sure (first time doing this). Any idea on what might be going wrong? eth0 gets assigned an 169.xx address, which according to the manual ""is assigned by windows when an address cannot be obtained by dhcp'"

[none]	[09:49]	<osotogari>	excellent! Im off to upgrade so \o/
[none]	[09:49]	<Blake7984>	ZeromusDesktop its hardware raid though....why would it detect it as 2 seperate 250gb drives rather than just a single one?

[none]	[09:50]	<arcade>	neutrinomas1: True.  That means the router isn't giving you a dhcp address, and then you of course cannot connect to 192.168.0.1

[none]	[09:52]	<MagusG>	what all is included on the ubuntu dvd?
[none]	[09:52]	<zcat[1] >	arcade: seriously, hardware raid sucks; it ties your array to a single controller. Software raid has minimal overhead and huge advantages.

[none]	[10:11]	<paulproteus>	make-kpkg will make a kernel package.  --initrd is easy to understand, I hope; --append-to-version can be whatever you want, like your name.

[none]	[10:16]	<JDahl>	disasm: why don't you remove kde first, and dist-upgrade from a console?
[none]	[10:16]	<disasm>	it's no big deal, just everytime dpkg dies, have to dpkg -r some packages, and then dist-upgrade again till the next break
[none]	[10:17]	<matthew_w>	jorgp; When I did that for breezy, it missed some things
[none]	[10:17]	<matthew_w>	jorgp; Are you sure this won't?

[none]	[10:18]	<eggzeck>	deadcat: you have to request again.
[none]	[10:18]	<deadcat>	eggzeck: doh
[none]	[10:18]	<zcat[1] >	deadcat: in theory it's automatic. In practise I waited three months, got nothing, and re-ordered..

[none]	[10:20]	<pandamonium>	perhaps... and this is a long shot... perhaps i should try switching it off and back on again
[positive]	[10:20]	<zcat[1] >	eggzeck: there was something in the website back then about not needing to reorder. Serves me right for actually reading the instructions? :)

[none]	[10:47]	<livingdaylight>	where did K3B go?
[none]	[10:47]	<xanavim>	r0xoR: plus you can rescue and/or install with it, so one less cd to burn

[none]	[10:54]	<rukuartic>	scifi: Nooo You're in dapper now. No going back to older ubuntus.
[none]	[10:54]	<sibblegp>	when I use a terminal in KDE now that I've upgraded to dapper, my backspace key when held won't go back more than a single space!
[none]	[10:55]	<grasshopper>	man, seems like automatix is some kind of virus
[none]	[10:55]	<intelikey>	ok.   i guess if i'd install lsb now it will set a lsb_release to say dapper lts  ?
[none]	[10:55]	<gnomefreak>	intelikey: if your not showing updates your up to date
[none]	[10:55]	<kane777>	"OK... solved... now only one more question: I lost some shortcuts in system->Administration menu. What packages are ""responsible"" for those icons?? I only have device manager, disks, networking, printing, services,shared folder, synaptic, time and date, user groups... I know that there were more of them... can anybody help, please???"
[none]	[10:55]	<eobanb>	grasshopper, please do not ask about automatix anymore; if you choose to use it you're completely on your own; i recommend reading the forum instead and using synaptic, or if you really have to, easyubuntu
[none]	[10:55]	<gnomefreak>	grasshopper: it is a very fast/sure way to mess up your pb
[none]	[10:55]	<gnomefreak>	c
[none]	[10:55]	<yoyoyo>	rackerz: no i havent but ill give it a try
[none]	[10:55]	<eobanb>	grasshopper, automatix is not a virus
[negative]	[10:55]	<Bizzeh>	i got http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/ubuntu-6.06-desktop-amd64.iso and it is just a live cd
[none]	[10:55]	<rukuartic>	scifi: Um... Ok well do you know how to use a terminal? I can't help you reconfigure xorg, but I can help you on your way
[none]	[10:55]	<NoUse>	kane777 is the ubuntu-desktop package installed?
[none]	[10:55]	<eobanb>	grasshopper, it's just a crappy tool to use
[none]	[10:55]	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, do you know of a way that i can fix the problem dapper is having with davicom ethernet adapter?
[none]	[10:55]	<Firebird8>	if dapper is realsing as 6.06 what would be the next version?
[none]	[10:55]	<Bizzeh>	why have the live cd, not marked as such
[none]	[10:55]	<rukuartic>	"Bizzeh: Didja click the ""Install to HD"" script on the desktopo?"
[none]	[10:55]	<pandamonium>	paulproteus, did you get a chance to see the info yet?
[positive]	[10:55]	<rackerz>	yoyoyo: it's probably the best option. it configures everything for you :)
[none]	[10:55]	<eobanb>	Firebird8, the Edgy Eft
[none]	[10:55]	<manolis>	is there any good download manager for ubuntu?
[none]	[10:55]	<xanavim>	"Bizzeh: click on the ""install"" and install it to your hard drive"
[none]	[10:56]	<gnomefreak>	Firebird8: 6.10
[none]	[10:56]	<kane777>	NoUse, hmm.. let me see...
[none]	[10:56]	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, No, did you give me a URI to it?
[none]	[10:56]	<gnomefreak>	h3h_timo: no i dont
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	rukuartic: what desktop?
[positive]	[10:56]	<ciaron>	wow sshd isn't installed by default, thats harsh :)
[none]	[10:56]	<sibblegp>	can someone tell me why the keyboard repeat is no longer functioning in Dapper?
[none]	[10:56]	<scifi>	rukuartic: can i startup a cli x-chat if i boot into dapper and use the cli ?
[none]	[10:56]	<pandamonium>	i think i /msg one to you
[none]	[10:56]	<revmouse>	gnomefreak: what determines ubuntu's version numbers?
[none]	[10:56]	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Let the livecd boot.
[none]	[10:56]	<Firebird8>	GNAM, i thought it went *.04 *.10 *.04 etc
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	i did
[none]	[10:56]	<eobanb>	ciaron, so install it.  not running ssh by default is much more secure.
[none]	[10:56]	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: the desktop, i.e. the pretty picture with file icons on it
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	i got to where it wanted to boot
[none]	[10:56]	<rukuartic>	"scifi: no, just type ""Irssi"" into the command prompt"
[none]	[10:56]	<grasshopper>	eobanb; i say virus, because it seems to linger like a disease. I don't recall ever using it. The forums were raving about it so i had a look, but i want to be rid of the pest
[none]	[10:56]	<FunnyHat_Work>	revmouse, mmyy
[none]	[10:56]	<gnomefreak>	revmouse: 6 = 2006 06= june
[none]	[10:56]	<delire>	revmouse: month/year
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	when it tried to load x
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	it didnt
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	and died
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	tried 4 times
[positive]	[10:56]	<delire>	revmouse: actually year:month ;)
[none]	[10:56]	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, I don't think you did.
[none]	[10:56]	<Bizzeh>	it cannot load x
[none]	[10:56]	<Jinkguns>	heya
[none]	[10:56]	<gnomefreak>	its year first month 2nd
[none]	[10:57]	<willdev101>	is drapper friendly to ATI cards?
[none]	[10:57]	<tbenita>	I changes  breezy to hoary in my sources.list and tried to dist-upgrade, now when I try to install gnome it says that it's not going to install
[none]	[10:57]	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, is there a way to find drivers for the adapter and install them over the ones currently installed?
[none]	[10:57]	<eobanb>	ciaron, you have to understand that most users of ubuntu don't need ssh, and those that do use it should know enough about it to know how to install and set it up themselves.  it's a self-solving problem
[none]	[10:57]	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Ouch. Um... Need to go somewhere else for that. But all we send out is LiveCD's. Takes the same ammount of time
[none]	[10:57]	<Bizzeh>	"because the ""ati"" driver doesnt work"
[none]	[10:57]	<xanavim>	willdev101: yes, most of them
[none]	[10:57]	<scifi>	rukuartic: what does that do ?
[none]	[10:57]	<paulproteus>	pandamonium, You have to be registered with NickServ for private messages to work.
[positive]	[10:57]	<ivoks>	jesus... 1055 people :)
[none]	[10:57]	<Bizzeh>	"its the ""fglrx"" driver i need"
[none]	[10:57]	<xanavim>	,ati
[none]	[10:57]	<delire>	tbenita: why are you downgrading?
[none]	[10:57]	<revmouse>	willdev101: I have an ATI with the fglrx driver, it works great
[none]	[10:57]	<tbenita>	ups : changes sources.list to drapper
[none]	[10:57]	<xanavim>	ubotu: ati
[positive]	[10:57]	<pandamonium>	ah, that would explain it
[negative]	[10:57]	<ubotu>	I guess ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ... the radeon 9200 and below are supported by the open-source drivers
[positive]	[10:57]	<ciaron>	eobanb: true, was just a bit suprised thats all :) it is the server edition after all, but it is more secure yes
[none]	[10:57]	<Jinkguns>	I have a question, I just installed Network Manager but I can't find any type of menu entry to access it.
[none]	[10:57]	<eobanb>	ivoks, what can i say, it's the day of dapper's release.  i'm sure it'll climb even higher in a few hours
[none]	[10:57]	<rukuartic>	"scifi: irssi = irc chat ^_^ ""/connect irc.freenode.net"" and then ""/join #ubuntu"""
[none]	[10:57]	<gnomefreak>	h3h_timo: check the hardware site see if your network adapter is supported it should give drivers/instructions from there
[positive]	[10:58]	<ivoks>	eobanb: :)
[none]	[10:58]	<nnz>	is there any disk checking util for bad blocks?
[none]	[10:58]	<xanavim>	Jinkguns: try man NetworkManager
[none]	[10:58]	<eobanb>	ciaron, just sudo apt-get install ssh
[none]	[10:58]	<Bizzeh>	ok, so, run the live cd
[negative]	[10:58]	<pandamonium>	http://www.eggwhisk.co.uk/ubuntu/config.html
[negative]	[10:58]	<delire>	tbenita: there's no need to do that. that's the wrong way to do it. do this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperUpgrades
[none]	[10:58]	<ciaron>	eobanb: thats the client isn't it?
[none]	[10:58]	<rukuartic>	ciaron: or if you want the daemon, use sshd.
[none]	[10:58]	<gnomefreak>	rukuartic: chat.freenode.net
[none]	[10:58]	<pandamonium>	that would be it
[none]	[10:58]	<Bizzeh>	how do i make it load fglrx?
[none]	[10:58]	<rukuartic>	gnomefreak: I use IRC ;p
[none]	[10:58]	<ciaron>	ah yes
[none]	[10:58]	<ivoks>	so, how do you like dapper?
[none]	[10:58]	<eobanb>	ciaron, as far as i know the ssh metapackage includes both the client and sshd.
[none]	[10:58]	<l>	can someone help me? i just installed proftpd but i cannot get my machine to accept an ftp connection
[none]	[10:58]	<willdev101>	would drapper work on a x300 card?
[none]	[10:58]	<tbenita>	I take a look thx delire
[none]	[10:58]	<eXistenZ>	!ati
[negative]	[10:58]	<ubotu>	hmm... ati is http://help.ubuntu.com/starterguide/C/ch04.html#installatidriver or https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI ... the radeon 9200 and below are supported by the open-source drivers
[none]	[10:58]	<h3h_timo>	gnomefreak, alright thanks
[none]	[10:58]	<eobanb>	willdev, sure, just make sure to install ati's drivers
[none]	[10:59]	<rukuartic>	l: You might be behind a firewall, or your ISP may not let you accept connections, or you may have it configured properly. But I have to go now, just throwing out some ideas.
[positive]	[10:59]	<scifi>	rukuartic: ok sweet, i'll brb after reboot :)

[none]	[10:59]	<blehe>	Hey will ubuntu resize my windows partition for me?
[none]	[10:59]	<ciaron>	eobanb: yeah its changed in dapper from what i can see, ssh is now a transitional package for openss-{client|server}

[none]	[10:59]	<rukuartic>	Bizzeh: Try putting your question all in one line, it helps people see your question better

[none]	[11:00]	<eobanb>	Jinkguns, of course it does

[none]	[11:01]	<Jinkguns>	eobanb, well there is no menu entry and the man page dosen't mention it
[none]	[11:01]	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: there's a good chance using fglrx will only give you fast 3d
[none]	[11:01]	<delire>	tbenita: best to use the above command.
[none]	[11:01]	<Booo>	has anyone here gotten airport extreme working?
[none]	[11:01]	<ipfw>	how long will it be before #ubuntu+1 is opened back up ?
[none]	[11:01]	<xanavim>	Bizzeh: it probably won't solve your problem
[none]	[11:01]	<eobanb>	oknewbie, yes, you can do that by adding a directive to your httpd.conf file.  you may want to ask in #apache about that, however
[none]	[11:01]	<Wes>	eobanb: The partitioner is not recognizing my partitions already on the HDD

[none]	[11:20]	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: I've just looked at the code for that module, and it seems you'll only need the linux kernel-headers (they're in a much smaller package)
[none]	[11:20]	<pgquiles>	does Dapper include XGL?
[none]	[11:20]	<azurehuesofblue>	thanks

[none]	[11:20]	<revmouse>	Tom__: try installing build-essentials
[none]	[11:20]	<eobanb>	grasshopper, i'm not sure how to fix your problem.
[none]	[11:20]	<luis_>	will truetype fonts work if I put them inside a '.fonts' folder inside the home directory?

[none]	[11:20]	<dunnix>	hello everyone
[none]	[11:20]	<eobanb>	grasshopper, you might try asking tomorrow when it will (hopefully) be less crazy here.
[none]	[11:20]	<grasshopper>	eobanb;   :|
[none]	[11:20]	<nickm__>	are there any ubuntu podcasts?
[none]	[11:20]	<crimsun>	linux-kernel-headers is for glibc, which is /not/ what you want.
[positive]	[11:21]	<munckfish>	scifi: ok in that case I'm not sure how to help cause I have an ATI card had to do this, http://munckfish.net/blog/archive/2006/02/07/ubuntu-on-acer-aspire-9500/, to fix it for breezy seems I have to do the same for dapper. Need someone with your card to relate their experiences.
[none]	[11:21]	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: yes, that, for i386.  you'll need gcc and 'make' too
[none]	[11:21]	<ryanakca>	is paste.ubuntu-nl.org down?
[none]	[11:21]	<popey>	grasshopper: have you looked at the settings in System --> Admin --> Networking ?
[none]	[11:21]	<grasshopper>	eobanb; hahaha...you think it'll have cooled down by then?
[none]	[11:21]	<nickm__>	ryanakca: i think so
[none]	[11:21]	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, alright let me find them
[none]	[11:21]	<Crane>	wrtpeeps, check and compare you vert and horz freg settings in xorg.conf
[none]	[11:21]	<pgquiles>	eobanb thanks
[none]	[11:21]	<munckfish>	scifi: have you checked your X log?
[none]	[11:21]	<Crane>	make sure they match your monitors soecs
[none]	[11:21]	<NoUse>	nnz just run 'wget <URL>'
[none]	[11:21]	<Crane>	specs
[none]	[11:21]	<neutrinomass>	ryanakca: Yeah, so it seems.
[none]	[11:21]	<rata>	hi
[none]	[11:21]	<nnz>	why apt-get says cant connect to archive.ubuntu.com ? even if i can ping and wget from it?
[none]	[11:21]	<scifi>	munckfish: i dont know how to get out of this irssi to check it
[none]	[11:21]	<lazzarello>	would it be possible to use debootstrap from dapper to install debian on a CF card?
[none]	[11:21]	<h3h_timo>	RandolphCarter, and i need each of their dependencies too??
[none]	[11:22]	<nnz>	NoUse just did and i could get sources.gz
[none]	[11:22]	<popey>	nnz: might be better to use a geographically closer source?
[none]	[11:22]	<NoUse>	nnz do you run through a proxy?
[none]	[11:22]	<grasshopper>	popey; nice! no i hadn't. I was told to look in Network Proxy
[none]	[11:22]	<nnz>	NoUse nope
[none]	[11:22]	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: yes, gcc only depends on cpp and gcc-4.0
[positive]	[11:22]	<scifi>	munckfish: im using this cli chat because obviously i have no xserver :P
[none]	[11:22]	<nickm__>	no one knows any ubuntu podcasts?
[none]	[11:22]	<munckfish>	scifi: when the screen goes blank Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get into the first pseudo terminal, then you can login and find the log from the command line
[none]	[11:22]	<screamz>	how can I reconfigure my sound ? it s not working anymore after the upgrade
[none]	[11:22]	<grasshopper>	popey; but this is different. Do you know how to configure this? IP address etc
[none]	[11:22]	<nnz>	popey what would u recomend for europe?
[none]	[11:22]	<luis_>	will truetype fonts work if I put them inside a '.fonts' folder inside the home directory?
[none]	[11:22]	<scifi>	munckfish: ty will try
[none]	[11:22]	<rata>	I am triying to change locales to a server using dapper, but dpkg-reconfigure doesn't do the trick, what could be happening ?
[negative]	[11:22]	<Jimmey__>	How can I put files into a smb:// directory through the command line?
[none]	[11:23]	<h3h_timo>	do cpp and gcc-4.0 depend on anything?
[none]	[11:23]	<eobanb>	h3h_timo, basically everything you'll need is going to be in ubuntu's repositories.
[negative]	[11:23]	<RandolphCarter>	h3h_timo: hmm, and they depend on a lot of other stuff :/ I think this would be a compelling argument for including at least build-essential on the install cd
[none]	[11:23]	<belkin>	hi all
[none]	[11:23]	<popey>	"grasshopper: set it to dhcp, and make sure the interface is ""active"""
[none]	[11:23]	<belkin>	from here do i get the net install cd ?
[positive]	[11:23]	<rata>	sorry, dpkg-reconfigure locales :)
[none]	[11:23]	<belkin>	i couldnt find it anywhere
[none]	[11:23]	<popey>	belkin: there isn't a net install cd
[negative]	[11:23]	<revmouse>	nickm__: http://ubuntuos.com/podcast/
[none]	[11:23]	<screamz>	aplay: device_list:221: no soundcards found...
[positive]	[11:23]	<RandolphCarter>	eobanb: the problem is we're downloading these to build a kernel module for his network card ;)
[none]	[11:23]	<eobanb>	h3h_timo, with apt you don't have to worry about manually resolving dependencies, just sudo apt-get build-essential and that will install gcc and everything else you need for you
[none]	[11:23]	<nickm__>	thanks revmouse
[none]	[11:23]	<Blissex>	luis_: depends on which font system you want to make them available under. For FontConfig that is good if you run 'fc-cache' after
[none]	[11:23]	<RandolphCarter>	eobanb: and in this case, unfortunately, we do
[none]	[11:23]	<pandamonium>	rata, is it locales or locale?
[none]	[11:23]	<Xenguy>	Hi - I have successfully upgraded from Breezy->Dapper.  The only glitch is that whereas before a Gnome desktop was loaded, now an XFCE4 desktop is loaded.  Can any one tell me why this may have happened, and is there a simple fix?
[positive]	[11:24]	<scifi>	munckfish: ctrl+alt+f1 dont seem to be doing nething for me :P
[none]	[11:24]	<rata>	pandamonium, tha package is locales
[none]	[11:24]	<gnomefreak>	Xenguy: did you have xfce to begin with?
[none]	[11:24]	<eobanb>	Xenguy, did you install xubuntu-desktop?
[positive]	[11:24]	<luis_>	Blissex, well I want them to be available to my current user, they are windows xp's truetype
[none]	[11:24]	<xanavim>	Xenguy: yes, there's a simple fix
[none]	[11:24]	<Jimmey__>	Xenguy, sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop; sudo apt-get --purge remove xubuntu-desktop
[none]	[11:24]	<ryanakca>	Seveas: You're in charge of ubuntu-nl.org ?
[none]	[11:24]	<belkin>	popey really ? so there is no way i can download only 100 mb to boot and install ubuntu from there ?
[none]	[11:24]	<SurfnKid>	amonia?
[none]	[11:24]	<popey>	"Xenguy: at the logon screen click ""options --> session"" and choose gnome"

[none]	[11:24]	<popey>	belkin: correct
[none]	[11:24]	<pandamonium>	rata, ok... it's just that i tried both and i can't remember which one worked for me
[none]	[11:24]	<Seveas>	ryanakca, yes and I know it's doen
[none]	[11:24]	<screamz>	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device <= can someone direct me to some troubleshooting?
[none]	[11:24]	<Seveas>	down*
[none]	[11:24]	<munckfish>	scifi: hmmm maybe it's something more serious then. Usually I can get into pseudo term if X isn't conf'd quite right
[none]	[11:24]	<xanavim>	Xenguy: it's easy to switch it back
[none]	[11:25]	<rata>	pandamonium, with dapper ?
[none]	[11:25]	<eobanb>	belkin, if you have limited bandwidth, you can get a CD shipped to you for free
[none]	[11:25]	<grasshopper>	popey; ok, set it to dhcp. HOw do i make sure the interface is active?
[none]	[11:25]	<eobanb>	!tell belkin about shipit

[positive]	[11:25]	<rata>	pandamonium, in general work, but no with dapper :)
[none]	[11:25]	<eobanb>	revmouse, the package name is build-essential, not build-essentials

[none]	[11:26]	<popey>	Heartsbane: it will come when edgy opens

[none]	[11:26]	<eobanb>	Heartsbane, 6.06 is the current version as of today.  ubuntu+1 is now for edgy eft

[none]	[11:27]	<Jimmey__>	azurehuesofblue, sudo apt-get install build-essential
[none]	[11:27]	<popey>	azurehuesofblue: i think you need the build-essential and make packages

[none]	[11:27]	<gnomefreak>	ryanakca: that i would check ~/.webboard
[none]	[11:27]	<xanavim>	nnz: can you ping the servers that you put in your repos?
[none]	[11:27]	<dsas>	azurehuesofblue: You should be able to install it from within ubuntu rather than compiling yourself.
[none]	[11:27]	<pandamonium>	eobanb, sorry, was just having a lighthearted banter
[none]	[11:27]	<dhonn>	anyone know what server kernel is optimzed for K8 arch?

[none]	[11:28]	<xanavim>	nnz: try removing some of the repos one by one until it works, then put them back in again one by one until you find the problem one
[none]	[11:28]	<intelikey>	<nnz sudo
[positive]	[11:28]	<rata>	pandamonium, btw, i found it. In dapper there is an other package called localeconf fot doing that :)

[none]	[11:29]	<grampajoe>	eobanb, It's not an error message, it just tells me I have to remove nvidia-glx if I want to install nvidia-settings
[none]	[11:29]	<popey>	dhonn: ahh, you have amd64?

I should add that I am stuck at 75Hz and I want to reduce to 60Hz. Anyone know how can resolve this, I'd be grateful for your help?
[none]	[11:49]	<xanavim>	penguinwhoflew: su isn't turned on, that's just a secure way of keeping the wrong people out of your system
[positive]	[11:49]	<dabaR>	SurfnKid: in your help menu

[none]	[11:49]	<SurfnKid>	dabaR, and thru terminal
[positive]	[11:49]	<crimsun>	DShepherd: yes, with the usual caveat to back up your data, etc.
[none]	[11:49]	<eobanb>	flossgeek, you could try editing your xorg.conf and setting the refresh rate to 60Hz manually.
[none]	[11:49]	<nbx909>	flossgeek, did you go into advanced to change the hz to 60?
[none]	[11:49]	<nnz>	god damn i make sshd to work , thank you all

[none]	[11:50]	<crimsun>	MehAdult: why not just use the included ndiswrapper?
[none]	[11:50]	<MehAdult>	crimsun: But the .debs are for 6.0.4 and I'm wondering if it's safe.
[none]	[11:50]	<Xyloc>	Hello everyone
[none]	[11:50]	<MehAdult>	crimsun: I'm not sure it's installed.
[none]	[11:50]	<nbx909>	flossgeek, advanced allows you to select the exact one
[none]	[11:50]	<SurfnKid>	iNiku, no idea I thought it was updated

[none]	[11:50]	<delire>	livevil: did you type the full path to the debian package and use the full name of that debian package? eg if i have a package called stuff.deb on the desktop i'd 'sudo dpkg -i /home/me/Desktop/stuff.deb'

[none]	[11:51]	<nbx909>	dhonn, that's only for the server edition
[none]	[11:51]	<eobanb>	nbx909, actually i think for some reason there is a metapackage

[none]	[11:57]	<crimsun>	petiteconne: yes, that delay is due to our init sequence
[positive]	[11:57]	<anthony>	okay, i have installed totem-xine (all of its dependencies) and totem-xine-firefox-plugin, and the w32codecs, but i still cannot play embedded medias

[none]	[11:57]	<dizy>	hi guys... i was thinking of installing ubuntu as a server... i was wondering if someone can point me to some reading material on firewall settings port forwarding etc
[none]	[11:58]	<pandamonium>	if i add the debian ftp package servers into my sources.list will i be able to use those?
[none]	[11:58]	<crimsun>	petiteconne: it's intentional
[none]	[11:58]	<pandamonium>	and if so is there a major caveat?
[none]	[11:58]	<xanavim>	anthony: try libxine-extracodecs
[none]	[11:58]	<eobanb>	pandamonium, don't do that.
[none]	[11:58]	<crimsun>	pandamonium: it's very likely you'll hose your system.
[none]	[11:58]	<laxdragon>	my upgrade died on lvm2 dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/lvm2_2.02.02-1ubuntu1_i386.deb (--unpack): subprocess pre-installation script returned error exit status 10
[none]	[11:58]	<nbx909>	paddygman, yes but it will break your system
[none]	[11:58]	<kbrooks>	xfcefreak: are you a gnome freak or a xfce freak?
[none]	[11:58]	<eobanb>	pandamonium, it can sometimes work, but it's risky
[none]	[11:58]	<dabaR>	dizy: it depends on what you will be using as the firewall
[none]	[11:58]	<xfcefreak>	kbrooks: a lil of both ;0
[none]	[11:58]	<pappan>	exhale, ty i deselected i will try again
[none]	[11:58]	<nbx909>	laxdragon, reinstall
[positive]	[11:58]	<SurfnKid>	Jinkguns, Congratulations,  Feels good to be able to do this on your own doesnt it :D
[none]	[11:58]	<exhale>	pappan, np
[none]	[11:58]	<pandamonium>	eobanb, it will cause conflicts?
[none]	[11:58]	<crimsun>	laxdragon: did you read the release notes reading lvm?
[none]	[11:58]	<kbrooks>	xfcefreak: so why not gxfreak?
[none]	[11:59]	<dabaR>	dizy: man iptables is a fair place to start. That is the default firewall program.
[positive]	[11:59]	<petiteconne>	crimsun: but if i want to change it? is there no way? :)
[none]	[11:59]	<eobanb>	pandamonium, ubuntu's own repository is pretty huge.  it basically has everything debian's has.  so just stick with ubuntu's okay?
[none]	[11:59]	<laxdragon>	crimsun: no, got a link to it?
[positive]	[11:59]	<xfcefreak>	right now im customizing xfce ;)
[none]	[11:59]	<JonnyBoy>	eobanb: i went through the configuration of xserver-xorg, but that didn't help

[none]	[11:59]	<delire>	livevil: is synaptic open elsewhere? did you use sudo?
[none]	[11:59]	<crimsun>	petiteconne: sure, you can bump (increment) the gdm startup
[none]	[11:59]	<pandamonium>	eobanb, ok... just i'm having massive problems getting stuff from there
[none]	[11:59]	<Oddie>	exit
[none]	[11:59]	<eobanb>	heanol, i'd stick with grub.
[none]	[11:59]	<anthony>	xanavim: i can download them to my hard drive and play them fine, but when it's embedded in the browser, it doesn't work

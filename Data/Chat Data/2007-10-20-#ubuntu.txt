[00:00] <k1gwb> I have a laptop with a pcmcia cell phone data card, and a wifi connection...i'd like to bridge the 2 and make the laptop into an access point so it can go online through the cell card, and other laptops can connect to mine and use the network connection.  Is this possible?
[00:00] <Tchaka> Slart, okay ;)
[00:00] <ubotu> File libmp3lame.so found in liblame-dev
[00:00] <seamus7_> lucita: and your sound was working back in feisty?
[00:00] <dr_spork> Does anyone know where Gutsy stores it keyboard shortcuts file? I just upgraded and now the GUI doesn't seem to have any actual effect on the keyboard shortcuts...
[00:00] <lucita> yes, it did

[00:00] <espen> Hi, i need help with the effects in ubuntu, could someone help me?
[00:00] <seamus7_> lucita: what kind of sound device do you have?
[00:00] <Tigerman> i have lost my Restart and Shutdown buttons... how can i enable them?
[00:00] <LjL> !helpme | espen
[00:00] <ubotu> espen: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[00:01] <kitche> HOLOGRAPHICpizza: System or by typing ccsm in a terminal
[00:01] <stream> k1gwb: yes it should work
[00:01] <Slart> espen: you could try asking in #compiz-fusion .. that's where the bling bling people hang out
[00:01] <seamus7_> espen: what's the issue?
[00:01] <Slart> espen: or ask here.. see if you get a response
[00:01] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: Right click on the panel you wish to add those buttons and click add to panel
[00:01] <Jordan_U> k1gwb, I don't know about the wifi or cell wireless sides of the problem, but Firestarter / iptables can allow you to share the connections
[00:01] <dsnyders> Hi all.  I would like to get back into programming for fun.  I want to do some text processing and some a-life simulation, but I don't want to get as heavy as C.  Any language/programming environment suggestions?
[00:01] <pyrak> am i supposed to still just have the little "desktop effects" window for the spiffy new cube thing?
[00:02] <chorne> I'm having some weird issues with my resolution that I just can't seem to figure out
[00:02] <lucita> sound blaster live platinum, i mean emuk10k1 chipset , ct4760. it appears in the hardware information program
[00:02] <pwnt-> I try to cp file.tar.gz to/my/eternal/hdd however I got this output.
[00:02] <src> Dumptruck, not sure if i told you to run sudo grub-install hd0 before rebooting...
[00:02] <espen> Ok, i cant change from "None" to "Normal" or "Extra" on the visual effects settings
[00:02] <Slart> dsnyders: python seems popular
[00:02] <pwnt-> org@nawaf:~$ cp org.tar.gz /media/disk/
[00:02] <pwnt-> File size limit exceeded (core dumped)
[00:02] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: then look around and see the desktop & windows area
[00:02] <markt9> Greetings, I'm not a seasoned IRC user, but I'm having problems with my desktop after upgrading to 7.10 today.  After a successful upgrade, when I reboot and enter my logon name and password, I hear the drums and get the new wallpaper, but the application bar menu on the top of the screen won't drop down and I can't click on anything.  I tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and that didn't seem to make any difference.  x does seem fine,
[00:02] <Dumptruck> src: ok something different happened (which I think is good) I got a new error message: Following file is missing or corrupt:
[00:02] <pwnt-> does that means the file didn't copied properly?
[00:02] <Dumptruck> no you didn't
[00:02] <leprasmurf> hello all
[00:02] <seamus7_> espen: perhaps your computer isn't compatible with compiz
[00:02] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, i have lost them in the 'Quit...' window
[00:02] <pwnt-> Dumptruck: thats for me?
[00:03] <wolfmanz> anyone having issues with firefox displaying the www.gamespot.com web site?
[00:03] <Jordan_U> markt9, What about "killall gnome-panel" ?
[00:03] <chorne> I have managed to get my monitor chosen in the new screen app, and I can see my wanted resolution (1600x1200@75) in the dropdown
[00:03] <Dumptruck> <windows root>  \system32\hal.dll
[00:03] <espen> The "Visual Effects" settings doesnt have anything to do with compiz? Or am i wrong?
[00:03] <akaishi> Hi, I've got a wrecked up dpkg status database, is there a way to rebuild it without a backup?
[00:03] <leprasmurf> having some problems with gutsy and compiz, running with nvidia and keep getting black screens when I open new windows (seems to happen when alof of ram is being used)
[00:03] <Dumptruck> please re-install a copy of the file above
[00:03] <markt9> Jordan, I can't even get to a terminal prompt
[00:03] <chorne> but when I try to set it it tells me all users must log off before changes can take effect
[00:03] <markt9> should I reconfigure gnome-panel?
[00:03] <Dumptruck> src:  ??? now I am confused
[00:03] <kitche> leprasmurf: a bug in the nvidia driver most likely
[00:03] <Slart> wolfmanz: works here.. ads and all =)
[00:04] <shk> hey guys, upgrading to ubuntu 7.10 killed my compiz - now it wont start - is there any way to fix this?
[00:04] <Dumptruck> well I guess more confused
[00:04] <Stormx2> markt9: Ctrl + Alt + F1?
[00:04] <leprasmurf> kitche: know of a work around?
[00:04] <chorne> restart X, and 1600x1200 is no longer in the resolution list, closest thing I can see is 1600x1024
[00:04] <espen> The "Visual Effects" settings doesnt have anything to do with compiz? Or am i wrong?
[00:04] <neztit1> ty 7.10 ? its not working 4 me - i have get this messege   Floating point exception (core dumped)
[00:04] <pwnt-> can somebody help me please. I asked my question above few lines don't want to repeat
[00:04] <garu> espen what do you see when u try to enable the desktop effects?
[00:04] <Slart> espen: I think you're wrong
[00:04] <K3nt> has anything changed in gutsy in terms of games?
[00:04] <kitche> leprasmurf: install newer drivers since it probably the last version of nvidia which had that bug
[00:04] <leprasmurf> kitche: k, thanks
[00:04] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: whoa... you lose the restart/shutdown icons in the quit menu? sorry, that's beyond my scope... never had that issue before, try asking again here maybe someone will pick it up.
[00:04] <espen> "Desktop effects could not be enabled"
[00:04] <seamus7_> espen:  yes you only get the fancy effects with compiz ...
[00:05] <garu> espen did u enable restricted drivers?
[00:05] <src> Dumptruck, that's probably from windows thinking it's still on the first disk...
[00:05] <espen> No, i dont know what that is :S
[00:05] <src> Dumptruck, I don't know how to fix that :)
[00:05] <robj232323> can't you run beryl without compiz though?
[00:05] <k1gwb> Jordan_U: at home i have two eth cards, and share the connection, it was very easy. i'm not sure how this would differ with having to make it an access point i guess?? the cell card is really a usb device
[00:05] <heartsblood> are there any applications I can download that will let me test 3d sound output from my soundcard?
[00:05] <seamus7_> espen: it comes with gutsy by default but only is activated if gutsy deems your computer compatible
[00:05] <heartsblood> -other than some game
[00:05] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, yeah that's a bugger, i knnow
[00:05] <newguy> !paste
[00:05] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[00:05] <garu> espen click on System, then Administration, then in Restricted Drivers Manager
[00:05] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: let's try to backtrack... what major changes have you done before you lost those buttons?
[00:05] <Fastn> I cant activate my visual effects, is it because compiz have my graphiccard in blacklist?
[00:06] <akaishi> Is there a way I could wipe out my whole package database and reinstall everything via internet?
[00:06] <ceed> does anyone know a lil about Bittornado or rTorrent? i need to create a torrent
[00:06] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, ii did somme settinngs
[00:06] <Vlet> robj232323: there is no more beryl
[00:06] <wolfmanz> slart is your menubar at the top in one piece where the pc and xbox360 and all that are or is that broke up into two menu bars one above the other?
[00:06] <heartsblood> ceed: get deluge-torrent.
[00:06] <Dumptruck> schucks... can you point me to a place or person who might be able to help?
[00:06] <garu> Fastn what do u see when u try to activate?
[00:06] <Jordan_U> akaishi, Sort of, what are you trying to accomplish?
[00:06] <ceed> whats thatr
[00:06] <heartsblood> ceed: it's basically utorrent for linux if you've ever used utorrent
[00:06] <Slart> heartsblood: I don't know of anything that generates 3d sound.. but I'm sure there are THX-sound samples and such out there.. you could play those with.. say VLC or something
[00:06] <ceed> yea i did but im connecting tru ssh
[00:06] <heartsblood> Slart: didn't think about that, ty.
[00:06] <Fastn> garu: It tells me, Desktop effects couldnt be enabled
[00:07] <robj232323> ..oh..does anyone have the problem where videos won't play when using multiple desktops?
[00:07] <robj232323> is there a fix
[00:07] <Slart> wolfmanz: I can send you a screenshot.. that way you can look and compare all you want
[00:07] <newguy> hey there im having some trouble with azureus, im getting this in the output : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41240/   help!!
[00:07] <Tigerman> ii'll figure it out
[00:07] <Blama[STOLZEN]> LjL, the output is "/dev/sda2 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)"
[00:07] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: did you change your theme settings before the problem?
[00:07] <espen> Garu , i got this; "You have no Restricted Drivers"
[00:07] <akaishi> I have a bad IDE cable that causes a bunch of data errors when I install from CD, basically I want to do a net install without owning an install server
[00:07] <seamus7_> espen: what kind of graphic card do you have?
[00:07] <Tigerman> hmm
[00:07] <heartsblood> ceed: ah term config seed?
[00:07] <garu> Fastn did u enable restricted drivers?
[00:07] <lucita> quite interesting, alsamixer works in a shell
[00:07] <espen> seamus7_ , i dont know v_v
[00:07] <Fasm1> Utter newbie: Does the dual monitor support work with anyone with 7.10 ? I'm using a live-cd, no installation on a hd partition yet
[00:07] <Dumptruck> src: this is what I found... but I don't know what it will do to ubuntu (anything?)
[00:07] <ceed> heartsblood: no idea
[00:07] <wolfmanz> slart can you send that on here?
[00:07] <Dumptruck> http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/repairbootini.htm
[00:07] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: try to set your theme settings in Appearance back to default temporarily... set everything to Human and let me know if you still have the problem.
[00:07] <heartsblood> ceed: I do know that deluge has some http/https configurations but i've never used them before.  not sure about ssh
[00:07] <garu> espen is your system up-to date?
[00:07] <Vlet> newguy: you might have to ask the azeuras people about that
[00:08] <Fastn> garu: were to? i have a intergrated videocard from the Intel 965 chipset
[00:08] <cliechti> now where is that shiny new X config window that is prised in the news? i still get the old one in system->prefs and the news don't mention hot to start the new one
[00:08] <espen> garu ,  i think so
[00:08] <heartsblood> ceed: as long as the host isn't behind a firewall you should be able to use your browser to make any changes you need
[00:08] <tck0> so if i have a sata hdd /dev/sda, and a ide hdd /dev/hda, would /dev/hda1 be (hd1,0) ?
[00:08] <garu> espen do sudo apt-get update, and when its finished do sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[00:08] <Slart> wolfmanz: I'll put it on some picture sharing site
[00:08] <ceed> heartsblood: i dont think that client is allowed on the site im trying to upload torrents
[00:08] <Cable86> cliechti: system>administration>screens and graphics
[00:08] <src> Dumptruck, try that. i guess you'd have to boot from the CD
[00:08] <wolfmanz> slart ok send me the link
[00:09] <heartsblood> ceed: are you sure what your doing is legal?  if bittorrent is acceptable, deluge should be as well.
[00:09] <Fastn> garu: were to? i have a intergrated videocard from the Intel 965 chipset
[00:09] <espen> garu ,  in the Terminal, right?
[00:09] <garu> Fastn check if u have any restricted drivers, if u got for the graphics card, enable it.Its in System, Administration, and then Restricted Drivers manager
[00:09] <src> Dumptruck, but from grub's point of view it finds the windows boot loader as it should...
[00:09] <garu> espen yes in the terminal
[00:09] <Dumptruck> but there are other suggestions - http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbyerrormessage/a/missinghaldll.htm
[00:09] <espen> garu it says "password for espen:"
[00:09] <ceed> heartsblood: yes its legal and i just checked and its not due to ratio cheaters
[00:09] <Blama[STOLZEN]> LjL, the output is "/dev/sda2 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro)"
[00:10] <LjL> Blama[STOLZEN]: so you *can* save settings, generally speaking. i suspect that the problem with networking is network-manager, and possibly the problem with X is bulletproof-x...
[00:10] <Fastn> garu: No, my card isnt there, only for intel wireless connection
[00:10] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, i have the same problem after changing the themes
[00:10] <heartsblood> ceed: then i'm afraid i'm no help.  I've never configured bittorrent to superseed using the .config.
[00:10] <garu> espen you have to enter your password :o...the one you use to login
[00:10] <HOLOGRAPHICpizza> what is the name of the package with the compiz setting manager?
[00:10] <ceed> heartsblood: my choice is bittornado or rtorrent, and i have both installed and i know how to use them, but i dont know how to create a torrent with either of them
[00:10] <Slart> wolfmanz: http://img164.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotgamespotvideool9.png
[00:10] <Dumptruck> second... if I change the boot priority to the windows disc then change back after the repair...  hypothetically everything should be proper... no?
[00:10] <espen> garu ,  i cant enter anything!
[00:10] <garu> Fastn is ur system up-to-date?
[00:10] <cliechti> Cable86: ok, i have german menus. the closest thing translates into "screen resolution" and thats the old one. do i need to install something? i was using gutsy for months. but the system is up to date as of today
[00:10] <ceed> heartsblood: oh well thanks for help anyway will have to look for it some more
[00:10] <heartsblood> ceed: have you checked the bittornado wiki?
=== Greyhound_ is now known as Greyhound-
[00:11] <Slart> wolfmanz: that's without flash
[00:11] <heartsblood> ceed: If all you need to do is host a torrent you should be able to get that information off the wiki
[00:11] <PriitM> Hi! Is Ubuntu 7.10 stable or is it still fresh?
[00:11] <src> Dumptruck, boot from windows cd as it is right now, go to recovery console (it will detect your windows installation) then after it's fixed, reboot
[00:11] <cliechti> Cable86: i'm on AMD64 is the new one maybe not compatible?
[00:11] <ceed> thats what im doin now, but rtorrent first :p
[00:11] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, how is the 'Quit...' window called?
[00:11] <espen> garu , i found out
[00:11] <garu> espen yes you can...you wont see anything, its hidden, but its actually taking whatever you type, so, when it asks you for the password, enter your password and then click Enter
[00:11] <pwnt-> Wow wow. i had so much trash in my trashcan. I just emptied it and before i had 60G Used and only 7G Free. now after the empty trash I have only 30G Used, and 37G FREE!
[00:11] <Fastn> I´ve downloaded the version 7.10 the same day i came out, have it been any updates after that?
[00:11] <wolfmanz> slart ya thats how it should look on my screen that menu bar is split in half and i have this happen on 3 different computers so far
[00:11] <speaker219> pwnt- FASCINATING
[00:11] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, i wanna google some forums for this
[00:12] <src> Dumptruck, if you change the boot order it'sgonna work 100% because the windows disk will become disk0
[00:12] <espen> garu , ok i did that
[00:12] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, i wanna google some forums on this
[00:12] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, how is the 'Quit...' window called?
[00:12] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: that's scary... you'll have to use the terminal to shutdown then... the "quit" window is called well Quit Menu?
[00:12] <lucita> have to go, thanks everyone
[00:12] <lucita> bye
[00:12] <akaishi> is it even possible to do a net install with no CD at all?
[00:12] <Cable86> cliechti: hm, im not sure what it would translate into in german.  but it sounds to me like you're looking in system>preferences.  that's where my "screen resolution" menu item is.  my "screens and graphics" window is in system>administration, make sure you look there rather than system>preferences.
[00:12] <garu> Fastn then try this: sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl!
[00:12] <lavender_dream> Tigerman, google "Quit Menu" +Ubuntu for start
[00:12] <Blama[STOLZEN]> LjL, In the upper right it says nownetwork hardware detected. And if I open the Device Manager it closes right away and I cannot do anything. I also get a "Failed to initialize HAL error on startup"
[00:12] <garu> Fastn that's how I got mine to work
[00:12] <Tigerman> ok
[00:12] <Fastn> garu: Okey, i try
[00:13] <garu> espen what happened after that?
[00:13] <Adam__> anyone else have a problem with gparted since 7.04 upgrade to 7.10?
[00:13] <Cable86> HOLOGRAPHICpizza: compizconfig-settings-manager
[00:13] <HOLOGRAPHICpizza> thanks
[00:13] <espen> garu it downloaded some things at the first command you gave me, and downloaded none on the distro upgrade command
[00:13] <Adam__> mine sits there scanning forever, doesn't find partitions
[00:13] <ia1> on a thinkpad the on-screen-display works for volume changes on the Gutsy live CD, and it worked in Feisty, but not in a Gutsy upgrade!  any ideas?
[00:13] <pwnt-> why would my trash hold like 30GIG ???
[00:13] <speaker219> HOLOGRAPHICpizza: awesome nick
[00:14] <garu> espen ok then, do this: sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl
[00:14] <zouhair> Gutsy seems to really be in a real Beta stage
[00:14] <ia1> pwnt-: cause you moved 30gigs there?
=== ia1 is now known as ian1
[00:14] <cyphase> How can I change the default directory in F-Spot? Not just where newly imported images are put, but actually change the location of all the currently imported photos.
[00:14] <Jordan_U> pwnt-, Because you put 30 GIG of files in it ?
[00:14] <cliechti> Cable86: then something seems to be missing here. all i find there that is GUI related is the gdm config.
[00:14] <garu> espen when its finished, restart the computer
[00:14] <vraa> howdy guys!
[00:14] <OiPenguin> Has anyone tested 7.10 on Inspiron 6400?
[00:14] <Fastn> garu: i wrote "apt-get install xserver-xgl" but i couldnt find the package it said
[00:14] <akaishi> if I could get my package system working right I could reinstall firefox and google for my answers :/
[00:14] <pwnt-> when i delete something, it goes there by default?
[00:14] <speaker219> OiPenguin: I'm in the process right now
[00:15] <espen> garu, should it work now?
[00:15] <Adam__> i have 7.10 on an inspiron 8100, works fine
[00:15] <pwnt-> Jordan_U: :*
[00:15] <vraa> OiPenguin: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron6400
[00:15] <Rob125> Okay, everybody stop trying to download Gutsy! I'm trying to get some updates done here!
[00:15] <vraa> Rob125: you can download the CD and set it as an update source
[00:15] <garu> Fastn if your system is up-to-date, it should work :o
[00:15] <kotelo> damn
[00:15] <Cable86> cliechti: hm, thats interesting.  what is right after the restricted manager menu item?
[00:15] <garu> espen did u see anything being installed?
[00:15] <espen> garu yes
[00:15] <vraa> does someone know how to put this ubuntu alternate iso i downloaded onto a 4gb usb flash disk and install from it? i'm out of cd-r's :(
[00:16] <lavender_dream> Tigerman, also try "Shut Down menu"
[00:16] <kotelo> a lot of gnome lovers
[00:16] <kotelo> xD
[00:16] <wolfmanz> slart any idea what would cut that menubar in half like that?
[00:16] <Rob125> vraa: I've been on gutsy for about a month now -- I'm just trying to get some updates to other programs done ;)
[00:16] <Fastn> garu: well my system is up-to-date i think
[00:16] <Blama[STOLZEN]> Can anyone help me with this error when I login? "Internal error failed to initialize HAL!"
[00:16] <vraa> Rob125: oh nice, i haven't tried gutsy yet, i finally got my computer booting
[00:16] <HOLOGRAPHICpizza> OFF-TOPIC IRC NOOB QUESTION: How do you send a private message?
[00:16] <pwnt-> is there any updates in these two days?
[00:16] <OiPenguin> speaker219: Where I live, in Norway, I can choose between Celeron M, T2080 or T2130 processor. Which one do you have?
[00:16] <YoDaddeh> hello, how can i get the restricted ati drivers to work with the newest release?
[00:16] <Tigerman> hahaha i'm such an idiot
[00:16] <LjL> HOLOGRAPHICpizza: /msg nickname message - no need to shout
[00:16] <Slart> Rob125: try using a local mirror.. or you have to work on your threats a bit more.. I don't think your scaring the crowd enough ;)
[00:16] <Tigerman> lavender_dream, i fixed it now
[00:16] <garu> espen now, just before doing the restart, install the compiz configuration manager.Click on Applications, then Add/Remove Programs!
[00:16] <speaker219> OiPenguin: T130 I think
[00:17] <pwnt-> I had no updates in the past 4days, should i be worried?
[00:17] <speaker219> 2130*
[00:17] <garu> Fastn u might as well make sure of that :o
[00:17] <Dumptruck> src: so then I don't want to change the boot priority?
[00:17] <speaker219> T2130* gah
[00:17] <Fastn> garu: with apt-get update?
[00:17] <src> Dumptruck, no.
[00:17] <Vlet> pwnt-: are you on the gutsy pre-release?
[00:17] <Rob125> Slart: Well, there's 1332 of you here. If I get just one of you to stop, then I'll be.. well, sad, I guess, because I love ubuntu. (But I am using ubuntu-ca mirrors, yes).
[00:17] <Slart> wolfmanz: the web is a weird thing... webreaders can do so many weird things that I've stopped trying to understand it all
[00:17] <Fastn> garu: or apt-get dist-update?
[00:17] <Dumptruck> ah ha
[00:17] <cliechti> Cable86: that starts with a "v" in the translation and is the very last line
[00:17] <pwnt-> Vlet: yeah
[00:17] <Dumptruck> ok
[00:17] <garu> Fastn sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[00:17] <Vlet> pwnt-: that's probably why. it's not maintained
[00:17] <Dumptruck> I think I am just going to redo the boot.ini in windows
[00:18] <pwnt-> Vlet: whenever I try to update. it shows nothing in my update list. It thinks i'm up-to-date :)
[00:18] <Dumptruck> from the windows install disc
[00:18] <YoDaddeh> I cannot get the restricted ati graphics driver to load with the manager it says xorg-driver-fglrx is not enabled. How can I enable it?
[00:18] <pwnt-> Vlet: what should I do then.
[00:18] <OiPenguin> vraa: Can you interpret https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam/DellInspiron6400 for me. I find it really hard to find a laptop with no issues.
[00:18] <Vlet> pwnt-: you could upgrade, but I've heard people saying that it doesn't always go so well
[00:18] <dvayanu> hi, i have a problem that my fonts are looking ugly after upgrade to gutsy
[00:18] <src> Dumptruck, as you wish. I really don't know how windows handles this kind of stuff. it might work
[00:18] <Cable86> cliechti: bah, darn translations :-P  i'm not sure what to tell you then unfortunately :-(
[00:18] <dvayanu> in both kde and gnome
[00:18] <Dumptruck> thanks src for all of your help...
[00:18] <vraa> OiPenguin: are you ordering a new laptop?
[00:18] <Surb> what's the difference between the gutsy server image and the others? less packages?
[00:18] <src> np
[00:18] <Vlet> pwnt-: if you can, it's best to just backup your stuff and install gutsy clean
[00:18] <pwnt-> Vlet: so a backup of my home/user then get a new .iso burn it and fresh install, is that what you think i should do?
[00:18] <generalsnus> Guys.. i need some help here.. my friend has no cable network only his broadcom wireless..  he sees the driver in the restricted driver manager..but he cant ofc download it :/  is there some way i can find this driver and just send him the package(while he uses xp) ?
[00:18] <Vlet> Surb: no interface
[00:18] <espen> garu ,  is that the "Advanced Desktop Effects Settings"? I had that installed from before
[00:18] <Cable86> Surb: gutsy server has no gui (no gnome or kde or anything)
[00:18] <pwnt-> Vlet: Okay. that what I'm going to do :)
[00:18] <YoDaddeh> guess nobody knows how to help me with this problem :(
[00:19] <nancy_69> Please guys i have a problem with the disable tabs of the compiz settings manager
[00:19] <Surb> ah, okay.
[00:19] <Vlet> pwnt-: yeah, you'll likely be happier with the results
[00:19] <vraa> OiPenguin: if you check the links, it says that all issues with this laptop have been resolved. so that means with little or no effort, ubuntu will work fine :)
[00:19] <garu> espen oh, ok then, then do the restart then :)
[00:19] <lavender_dream> Tigerman: how did you fix it?
[00:19] <Dumptruck> if you are ever in Bratislava I'll buy you a beer
[00:19] <OiPenguin> vraa: Yes. I'd like to do it tonight, but I'm starting to think that I should wait a bit further to allow people to test Gutsy properly. The one I've borrowed is shitty, though.
[00:19] <Dumptruck> third problem...
[00:19] <speaker219> !language | OiPenguin
[00:19] <ubotu> OiPenguin: Please watch your language and topic, and keep this channel family friendly.
[00:20] <seamus7_> nancy_69: what do you mean?
[00:20] <espen> garu , can i ask, what does the thing i installed do? THe xgl or something? :P
[00:20] <pwnt-> Vlet: in the installation will it take me to a GUI to install gutsy? or will it take me to a terminal where I have to do "sudo apt-get install desktop" ?
[00:20] <nickrud> dvayanu: system->prefs->appearance, fonts tab, play around with the rendering selections
[00:20] <OiPenguin> vraa: No need to wait, in other word. (Sorry about the language)
[00:20] <generalsnus> Guys.. i need some help here.. my friend has no cable network only his broadcom wireless..  he sees the driver in the restricted driver manager..but he cant ofc download it :/  is there some way i can find this driver and just send him the package(while he uses xp) ?
[00:20] <Reng> have anyone fixed the splash in gutsy where you cant change the color? its always set on beige.
[00:20] <vraa> OiPenguin: if you're unsure, you can always download now and install later :)
[00:20] <speaker219> No problem OiPenguin :)
[00:20] <addicted68098> I'm having trouble with my CD burning software, does anyone know of something free on the windows side so I can burn the image I quite windows cold-turkey (:
[00:20] <wycked> hi everyone
[00:20] <speaker219> Yeah
[00:20] <akaishi> dpkg: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 18767 package `libnautilus-burn3': `Conflicts' field, invalid package name `nautilus/cd-burner': character `/' not allowed - only letters, digits and -+._ allowed

[00:20] <nickrud> addicted68098: infrarecorder, gpl
[00:21] <Fastn> garu: I had it up-to-date
[00:21] <Dumptruck> how do I install something that is not in the add/files... from a tar ball... I read the readme and it seems very confusing
[00:21] <Vlet> pwnt-: the regular cd has the nice gui. It's if you install the server distro that you have to install the gui manually
[00:21] <nancy_69> seamus7_  i open the manager and it doesnt let me choose anything
[00:21] <espen> garu , can i ask, what does the thing i installed do? THe xgl or something? :P
[00:21] <src> Dumptruck, is it source code?
[00:21] <Dr_willis> Dumptruck,  what is it you are trying to install? You will have some learning to do to install stuff from source.
[00:21] <Adam__> anyone know of a firewall gui for ubunut?
[00:21] <Dumptruck> this all seems a bit over my head http://forum.sopcast.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8631
[00:21] <garu> espen xserver-xgl!as far as I know, it will install xgl, on your system. without it, you will not be able to get the effects, it will tell you that the composite extention is not available!but now that u did, it should be fine
[00:21] <Fastn> garu: But does it have anything to do with compiz, because my card is in the blacklist of compiz
[00:21] <jo1> does anyone know of anything similar to ultrasurf 8 for ubuntu?
[00:21] <Dr_willis> !firewall
[00:21] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[00:21] <Dumptruck> I am trying to install Sopcast
[00:21] <generalsnus> Guys.. i need some help here.. my friend has no cable network only his broadcom wireless..  he sees the driver in the restricted driver manager..but he cant ofc download it :/  is there some way i can find this driver and just send him the package(while he uses xp) ?
[00:21] <Adam__> ty
[00:21] <cliechti> Cable86: do you know the package name? i just browsed the not installed packages in base, gnome and system section but i did not find an uninstalled package that could be it
[00:22] <OiPenguin> vraa: I've got an 7.10 on an old Fujitsu Siemens, but it's almost unbearable. I need to buy a machine before testing. But, if I understand you right, there's no need to hesitate buying 6400?
[00:22] <espen> garu, ok thanks! I'll get back on if it dont work
[00:22] <rstanca> hello, if I customize the livecd(add new packages to it) will the new packages be installed too(when I'll do an hd install) or there's something else I should do? (I found docs from here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization )
[00:22] <Dumptruck> !sopcast
[00:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about sopcast - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[00:22] <vraa> OiPenguin: if you haven't bought a machine yet, why not buy from system76.com or buy from the dell opensource collection ?
[00:22] <garu> Fastn its in the blacklist of compiz?I didnt even know that existed :o!In that case my friend, I can't help you :o
[00:22] <vraa> that will promise compatibility
[00:22] <garu> espen oki doki

[00:23] <cyzie> how do i grep <patterm> from all files but not including compress file ?
[00:23] <Gambaroni> If I install the package subversion, do I get both client and server then? I just want a client
[00:23] <Vlet> generalsnus: yes, do just that - ask him what the package is called, find the deb for it online, and get it for him
[00:23] <witless> how do i turn on compiz?
[00:23] <Fastn> garu: when i run "compiz --replace" i get blacklisted PCIID"
[00:23] <garu> Fastn what's your graphics driver?
[00:23] <wirechief> rstanca: no
[00:24] <wycked> is compiz-fusion installed with Gutsy ?
[00:24] <garu> witless enable the desktop effects
[00:24] <Cable86> cliechti: let me see if i can find it
[00:24] <witless> garu: i just ran compiz and got "blacklisted pciid"...
[00:24] <seamus7_> nancy69: which manager are you speaking .... Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
[00:24] <Jimdb> wycked:  yes it is
[00:24] <garu> wycked yep.but u have to enable the desktop effects!
[00:24] <Fastn> garu: Intel 695 chipset
[00:24] <generalsnus> Vlet: thats the problem..i dont know what package it is..other than that its a driver for bcm43xx
[00:25] <BrokenPipe> Did something change with how Xinerama is set in xorg.conf? I'm using the same config file and hardware, and with 7.10 xinerama is not working. Ideas?
[00:25] <Gambaroni> If I install the package subversion, do I get both client and server then? I just want a client
[00:25] <wycked> garu, yes effects are nabled
[00:25] <dn4> how long is the estimated time on the main repos being owned by downloaders?
[00:25] <garu> Fastn are those numbers right?isnt it Intel 965 GM?
[00:25] <Cable86> cliechti: looks like the package is called "displayconfig-gtk"
[00:25] <Dumptruck> src, sopcast .801 doesn't work on Ubuntu without severe tweaking.... is there anyinfo on 1.0.2?
[00:25] <rstanca> wirechief: no as in the new packages will not be installed, right?
[00:25] <garu> wycked do you get wobbly windows?
[00:25] <witless> i don't have a desktop effects menu option
[00:25] <wycked> Jimdb, great, but now how can I modify parameters of compiz now ?
[00:25] <Fastn> garu: let me check
[00:25] <wirechief> rstanca: that is correct, you need to install to save
[00:25] <addicted68098> Also I have good deal of music mounted off of the main drive, will the installer allow me to save it? thanks a bunch
[00:25] <garu> wycked u have to install compiz configuration manager
[00:25] <Jimdb> you should go into synaptic package manager and download the configuration tool.
[00:26] <Pici> !ccsm
[00:26] <ubotu> To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
[00:26] <wycked> Jimdb, garu, just it ?
[00:26] <ian1> on a thinkpad the on-screen-display works for volume changes on the Gutsy live CD, and it worked in Feisty, but not in a Gutsy upgrade!  any ideas?

[00:26] <Gambaroni> If I install the package subversion, do I get both client and server then? I just want a client
[00:26] <bardun_> gutsy is nice so far, but unfortunately i don't have any sound
[00:26] <nickrud> juanbond: Media Player on the menu :) (its rhythmbox)
[00:26] <cliechti> Cable86: yep that exists and is not (yet) installed
[00:26] <rstanca> wirechief: I don't think you understood my question, thanks anyway
[00:26] <wycked> juanbond, rhythmbox or banshee if you like mono
[00:26] <Dumptruck> on http://forum.sopcast.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=8631 I get lost on step 2
[00:27] <garu> wycked yep...open the Add/Remove Programs, click on Show all available applications and search for compiz, then install the ccsm!
[00:27] <YoDaddeh> when I installed
[00:27] <Cable86> cliechti: install away and see if that's what you're looking for, and let me know if i was correct :-)
[00:27] <CarlF1> Gambaroni: svn is only one package. the server "isn't that big" and it isn't started
[00:27] <jo1> does anyone know of anything similar to ultrasurf 8 for ubuntu?
[00:27] <heartsblood> does anybody know if there are any fish clients for OSX?
[00:27] <jo1> anyone heard of ultrasurf 8?
[00:27] <juanbond> nickrud: just wondering if there was anything better that people used.
[00:27] <Gambaroni> CarlF1 ok
[00:27] <juanbond> thanks!
[00:27] <CarlF1> Gambaroni: I had the same 'issue' :)
[00:27] <seamus7_> juanbond: Exaile is great in Gnome ... but so is Amarok
[00:27] <akaishi> good thing I made a copy, that caused all heck to break loose in synaptic
[00:27] <Fastn> garu: It was Intel 695GM chipset
[00:28] <YoDaddeh> when i installed 7.10, the internet connection did not work right at first and it ended up disabling the update server (secure one) how can i make it so I have the secure server again?
[00:28] <Gambaroni> CarlF1 :).. So no svn server would be set up automatically?
[00:28] <garu> Fastn one of my lappies is a toshiba, I got the Intel 965GM graphics card, and I'v never had any problems with compiz...never heard of it blacklisting that!
[00:28] <cliechti> Cable86: installed "bildschirme und grafik" which translates fine into english, and it looks fine. is that accidently not a dependency of the gnome-desktop package? (bug)
[00:28] <YoDaddeh> I can't install anything right now
[00:28] <mrfantastic> can anyone help me with my wifi?
[00:28] <YoDaddeh> none of the packages work
[00:28] <garu> Fastn oh, if its 695GM then, I dont know what to do!
[00:28] <nickrud> juanbond: there's banshee, muine, exaile, bmp
[00:28] <bashvean1> Aah, it's been over a day and tracker is still indexing, anyone know what's goingon?
[00:28] <caner> is there a graphical interface for apache2 configuration?
[00:28] <Dumptruck> when i download all these things i get a lot of RAR files and when i extract them i have no idea what to do with them
[00:28] <Cable86> cliechti: im not sure how it wasn't installed for you, i installed gutsy from scratch and it was installed by default, definitely strange
[00:29] <heartsblood> caner: In most places you'd be shot for asking that.
[00:29] <Rob125> caner: webmin is a decent one, if you can find it.
[00:29] <CarlF1> Gambaroni: right. you would have to manually start it
[00:29] <Gambaroni> ok
[00:29] <Gambaroni> ty
[00:29] <Jimdb> anyone know of a good pcmcia sound card that works in ubuntu?
[00:29] <Dumptruck> so I guess my root question is how do I become a ninja with Ubuntu?
[00:29] <Flannel> caner: Any graphical config worth anything would be more or less a glorified text editor.
[00:29] <caner> <heartsblood> thank you for not shooting me
[00:29] <mrfantastic> can anyone tell me why my wifi card wont work, even though ubuntu detects it?
[00:29] <Fastn> garu: I know :/ its sad, but i need to wait for the intel driver to fix, here is the full name of my family: Mobile Intel® 965 Express Chipset Family
[00:30] <nickrud> Dumptruck: just like a ninja, practice, fall down, get up, practice, fall down :)
[00:30] <charles> does anyone know why the installer for bison can't find three packages
[00:30] <akaishi> hrmm. why would editing a file cause it to become unreadable?
[00:30] <Joikast> Can someone help me enable the graphics driver? I cant get it work
[00:30] <mutable> Hi. I read that in gusty is fixed nvidia driver (that doesn't cause out of mem bug). However I still see black windows :(.
[00:30] <Rob125> Dumptruck: Sharpen live CDs into shurikens, and yield ps2 cables as whips.
[00:30] <wirechief> mrfantastic have you configured it and gave it your essid ?
[00:30] <caner> <Flannel> i ve recently discovered mysql administrator. thats why i asked
[00:30] <Rob125> wield*
[00:30] <heartsblood> Rob125: you win.
[00:30] <noelferreira> hi. how can i install beryl in 7.10 with nvidia?
[00:30] <Gursikh> Hi, just installed gutsy, and when I click the quit button I have no shutdown on reboot?
[00:30] <witless> G965 is blacklisted?  didn't intel release the technical info for that chip?
[00:30] <charles> 3 files not found on bison upgrade, any help?
[00:31] <Cable86> noelferreira: you don't want to install beryl, as it is no longer maintained....7.10 comes with compiz fusion by default
[00:31] <Joikast> Can someone help me enable the ATI graphics driver? I cant get it work..
[00:31] <mutable> Do I need to manually update nvidia driver?
[00:31] <espen> garu , hey again
[00:31] <garu> Fastn humn...that's pretty bad :o..sorry about that :o
[00:31] <noelferreira> Cable86: can you give me an howto to install it?
[00:31] <bashvean1> It's been about 2 days and tracker is still indexing, anyone know what's going on? running Ubuntu 7.10 by the way
[00:31] <VousDeux> My hardware is pretty new and is not yet fully supported by Gutsy. Can I expect additional hardware support to be included in future updates for Gutsy, or should I pursue Hardy?
[00:31] <garu> Joikast enable the restricted drivers

[00:32] <garu> espen lagging? :s
[00:32] <Fastn> garu: Well do you know were i can get any information about when a new release get out or so?
[00:32] <CarlF1> installed gutsy's nvidia, but direct rendering: No - is that expected ?
[00:32] <cliechti> Cable86: anyway, thanks. i made some changes and will see if they actually work on next login :-)
[00:32] <espen> And my keyboard is english (Its usually norwegian)
[00:32] <ArthurArchnix> VousDeux: What isn't supported?
[00:32] <Cable86> cliechti: sure thing :-)
[00:32] <espen> garu yeah
[00:32] <garu> noelferreira why beryl when u can have compiz fusion?
[00:32] <garu> Fastn humn...no idea :o!sorry
[00:32] <clyde> I'm trying to stop the network manager from loading in Gutsy, every time I uncheck the option it resets on the next logon
[00:33] <VousDeux> The video, the touch pad, HAL...a bunch of stuff.
[00:33] <Fastn> garu: Okey, thx anyway
[00:33] <bashvean1> Anyone at all know how long Tracker should take to index?
[00:33] <garu> espen what u just did, was supposed to fiz everything :o!lol
[00:33] <Cable86> noelferreira: it's already installed in 7.10
[00:33] <Flannel> VousDeux: What hardware? (whats not supported)
[00:33] <garu> espen fix
[00:33] <espen> gary it surely didnt
[00:33] <Cable86> noelferreira: but if you want to configure it more, install the package "compizconfig-settings-manager"
[00:33] <mrfantastic> does ndis still work for 7.10 or is it not needed any more
[00:33] <espen> garu though the effects are working now
[00:33] <mutable> Guys, I still see black windows with compiz on ubuntu
[00:34] <Dumptruck> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41245/ - what does this mean?
[00:34] <garu> espen how r ur pc specs?RAM and Graphics?
[00:34] <espen> garu ,my ram is 1 gig
[00:34] <VousDeux> Flannel: Nvidia 8500GT only works in 1600x1050, touch pad doesn't work right, HAL has problems with power managment...other stuff too
[00:34] <mutable> I's really bad, I just want a small amount of its features, but that black windows disrupts me
[00:35] <Dumptruck> I would like to repost on the thread I found so that I might help others who have this problem
[00:35] <ArthurArchnix> I wouldn't expect support for that to be backported to Gutsy. You're best bet is to keep an eye on kernel developments and file bug reports trying to get support for your hardware added in.
[00:35] <espen> garu i dont know about my graphics, cause i dont know what kind of graphic card i have
[00:35] <VousDeux> Flannel: I've been working on this stuff since August in #ubuntu+1, and I've filed several bug reports.
[00:36] <Flannel> VousDeux: Depending on the reasons, it'll vary.  If its bugs, they can (theoretically) be fixed, if its kernel support, you'll have to wait for the kernel version in ubuntu to catch up.
[00:36] <garu> espen try lspci
[00:36] <ArthurArchnix> VousDeux: But this is kernel development stuff, not Ubuntu stuff. Filing bugs against ubuntu wouldn't do anything.
[00:36] <livingdaylight> my internet connection is sooooooooooooooooo slow
[00:36] <espen> garu what_
[00:36] <espen> ?
[00:36] <ArthurArchnix> What flannel said
[00:36] <VousDeux> Flannel: much of my problems have to do with the x86_64 too
[00:36] <facugaich> Are there any official torrents?
[00:36] <garu> garu anywayz, if u got 1 gig of ram, I would assume ur graphics arent that bad either, it should run fine
[00:36] <livingdaylight> is it gutsy or my isp?
[00:36] <garu> espen at the terminal lspci
[00:36] <espen> Ok
[00:37] <Flannel> facugaich: There are.  What torrent are you looking for?
[00:37] <VousDeux> Flannel, ArthurArchnix: so, will these kernel updates apply to Gutsy then?
[00:37] <facugaich> Flannel: Ubuntu 7.10 Desktop
[00:37] <ghatak_mobile> Hi, i upgraded to Gusty from Fiesty. Upgrade went OK, however there is not compiz and when i do, glxinfo | grep direct, it returns NO. I have Nvidia 8600GT and it was working fine on Fiesty. I have installed the most recent Nvidia driver from Nvidia site but that does not make any difference. Help please.
[00:37] <efpdv1> do sound drivers come with ubuntu?
[00:37] <Dr_willis> facugaich, http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
[00:37] <espen> garu ok i did it
[00:37] <Flannel> facugaich: http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/  theyre all in there
[00:37] <garu> espen now check what graphics do u have
[00:38] <espen> garu adeon 9200 PRO
[00:38] <K3nt> is there anything better than pidgin for msging?
[00:38] <Flannel> VousDeux: Kernel updates (fixes) will, kernel versions (which is where a lot of the new hardware comes in) wont.  Gutsy will always have 2.6.22
[00:38] <K3nt> !msn
[00:38] <ubotu> Instant Messenger Clients: Gaim (GNOME, http://help.ubuntu.com/community/GaimHowto), Kopete (KDE), both supporting MSN, Jabber, AIM, Gadu-Gadu, Novell Groupwise, ICQ and IRC.
[00:38] <jmg> hi all
[00:38] <ezhateoven> is my loopback config correct in ubuntu 7.10 http://img484.imageshack.us/img484/5906/loopbacktx1.jpg
[00:38] <jmg> is there a gnome katapult?
[00:38] <bnovc> how can I install pangocario package in ubuntu?
[00:38] <garu> espen ur graphics r way better than mine!lol
[00:38] <facugaich> Flannel: Oh, thanks, they are kinda hidden
[00:38] <ArthurArchnix> VousDeux: Kernel updates tend to only patch issues, not add support for new hardware. I fear you're going to have to learn how to build and compile a kernel from source. You're either going to have to force Gutsy to use the lateest kernels from kernel.org, and file bug reports against it.
[00:39] <Slart> ghatak_mobile: I had the same problem with my 8800.. I had to go back to my old xorg.conf and do lots of other things before I could run compiz again.. the failsafe mode didn't work for me..
[00:39] <ArthurArchnix> Again, what flannel said. :P
[00:39] <espen> garu they are?
[00:39] <Flannel> ArthurArchnix: yeah, we've gotta stop stealing each others fire
[00:39] <espen> garu how come im lagging?
[00:39] <lavender_dream> easy question to some of you, is it possible to browse the 'net as just text via the terminal? :) if so how?
[00:39] <efpdv1> does ubuntu come packaged with a firewall?
[00:39] <VousDeux> Flannel: ahhh...so if I want my hardware to work, I will need Hardy and I will have to submit bug reports to kernel team?
[00:39] <garu> espen yep...no idea...
[00:39] <jmg> lavender_dream: lynx or elinks
[00:39] <Slart> lavender_dream: lynx is a text only browser
[00:39] <ArthurArchnix> You're always first. But my fingers are fat soo... there's that too.
[00:39] <Flannel> lavender_dream: sure.  Theres a bunch of terminal clients, type 'www-browser' in the terminal, and you'll get one (depending on whats default on your system)
[00:39] <Allenwr> sup guys
[00:39] <Rabiddog> Anyone know what this info reported in dmesg is about:
[00:39] <Rabiddog>  13.940000] attempt to access beyond end of device
[00:39] <Rabiddog> [   13.940000] sda: rw=0, want=1172134530, limit=586072368
[00:40] <garu> espen the effects only work well in my graphics card in 2 linux distros.lol
[00:40] <espen> garu maybe i need the drivers_
[00:40] <ghatak_mobile> Slart: Hmm... What exactly did you do to get it back,?
[00:40] <Dr_willis> lavender_dream,  theres also some way to get some basic graphics in the console with those browsers.
[00:40] <Dr_willis> isent it elinks -g ?
[00:40] <mrfantastic> can anyone direct me to someone or a guide for wifi on 7.10...i upgraded through the software updater in 7.04 if that helps
[00:40] <Flannel> VousDeux: Bug reports to the kernel team will help, especially if its not already supported.  I know I'm waiting for 8.04 for some HW on my thinkpad.
[00:40] <lavender_dream> jmg, Slart: thanks, will look into that, I just want to see if I can browse the 'net just in text INSIDE the terminal if that makes any sense, very new to this
[00:40] <WKTV|Archive> Hey
[00:41] <Flannel> lavender_dream: A full desktop experience is more or less available from the terminal, yes.
[00:41] <K3nt> any wow users here?
[00:41] <MattJ> K3nt: Messaging on any particular network?
[00:41] <lavender_dream> Flannel: that's cool :)
[00:41] <witless> i lost my X session during install, now when my machine boots, i can't log into the console at all.  i enter my login name and it says "login incorrect" without even asking me for my password...
[00:41] <Slart> ghatak_mobile: I wish I know.. I copied my old xorg.conf (it's backed up.. check for filenames like xorg.conf.200710101452 or similar).. I reinstalled the binary driver from nvidias site.. I did a lot of smaller stuff I got from googling then all of a sudden it all worked again
[00:41] <MattJ> K3nt: Otherwise I recommend Jabber, and use Gajim for a client
[00:41] <Flannel> witless: at GRUB, try selecting the recovery console
[00:41] <ArthurArchnix> witless: Is your capslock or numlock on?
[00:41] <WKTV|Archive> anyone here use wubi?
[00:41] <witless> Flannel: thanks, i'll try that.  ArthurArchnix: no
[00:41] <K3nt> MattJ: i just wanted something that supported offline users. msn preferably
[00:41] <Allenwr> Display Info: [1024x768 32bit 75Hz] ::: Monitor: [Plug and Play Monitor]
[00:42] <Fasm1> newbie: anyone has any suggestion on how to make 7.10 work with dual monitors? The System > Admin > Screen & Graphics  does not take the 2nd monitor's settings... is it because I'm on a live-cd of U7.10?
[00:42] <Allenwr> sorry
[00:42] <Slart> lavender_dream: that's what lynx and elinks does.. text mode browser you can run in a terminal
[00:42] <Flannel> witless: If it works, you'll get a root shell, from which you can try and sort stuff out (its single user mode)
[00:42] <witless> Flannel: ok
[00:42] <VousDeux> Flannel: sorry, I new to all of this new hardware support stuff...if I work with the kernel team, can I apply the new kernel to the Gutsy distro I installed, or will I need a whole new distro?
[00:42] <ghatak_mobile> Slart: was it all to do with xorg.conf ?
[00:42] <MattJ> K3nt: Jabber does, and it is open (not controlled by Microsoft), if you have the option, try it out
[00:42] <airtonarantes> Fasm1, I already tried here, but dont worked
[00:42] <Wipster> when I install Gutsy and hit the restrcted modules program to enable my gfx card drivers, is their any benifit to the nvidia driver installed with envy, and will it break it if I reinstall with that?
[00:43] <lavender_dream> Flannel: that www.browser tip you just gave me... THAT'S REALLY COOL! :) it's quaint, I love it
[00:43] <Fasm1> airtonarantes: I was so waiting for 7.10 for the dual monitor thing
[00:43] <warbler> !envy
[00:43] <ubotu> envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[00:43] <lavender_dream> Flannel: err.. www-browser I meant
[00:43] <Flannel> VousDeux: You can compile a newer kernel yes.  Although its technically not 'supported'
[00:43] <YoDaddeh> can anyone help me with gutsy?
[00:43] <Rabiddog> ubuntu nvidia drivers suck
[00:43] <Rabiddog> lol
[00:43] <lavender_dream> Slart: thank you very much, i'll look into that as well.
[00:43] <WKTV|Archive> whts wrong with this rabiddog?
[00:43] <airtonarantes> Fasm1, Well, work, but the screen is configured with resolution 640x580
[00:43] <Flannel> VousDeux: Ubuntu is linux just like any other, you can do anything you want with it.  The only limit is how dirty you want to get your hands.
[00:44] <Rabiddog> WKTV|Archive, alot of work needs to be done on the installation script
[00:44] <Slart> ghatak_mobile: well.. one thing was that X used the file xorg.conf.failsafe instead of xorg.conf . I don't know how that got fixed.. perhaps by running the "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver".. perhaps by reinstalling drivers.. I wish I knew more precisely
[00:44] <Fasm1> airtonarantes:  hmmm... I didn't try any lower resolutions, but I wouldn't want to use the 2nd monitor with lower resolutions
[00:44] <VousDeux> Flannel: I see...thank you...my main concern is hardware support before Ubuntu support, once I have all of the hardware working I can worry about other stuff.
=== WKTV|Archive is now known as zakman
[00:44] <nivekc1> how do i setup my video resolutions
[00:44] <bluefox83> how do you change a hard drive designation from /hda-1 to /hda1?
[00:44] <Wipster> warbler, I havn't had anyproblems with it in the past but warning heeded, leaving it alone heh
[00:44] <js_> VousDeux: the ubuntu kernel has basically everything enabled
[00:44] <airtonarantes> Fasm1, yes, of course. nor me
[00:44] <ghatak_mobile> Slart: Ok i will dig around thanks
[00:44] <zakman> when is ubntu going to use the new 2.6.23?
[00:45] <Flannel> VousDeux: you might try some of the other distros that keep up to date with stuff, see if the HW works there (so yo uknow its the kernels deficiency and not an issue with your compile or whatnot)
[00:45] <zakman> officially
[00:45] <nivekc1> like not pick the one i want to use but add them to that list of ones i can use
[00:45] <Flannel> zakman: Hardy, if not a later kernel
[00:45] <VousDeux> js_: my hardware was too new to be included in the Gutsy support
[00:45] <zakman> Hardy ;o
[00:45] <zakman> why so long?
[00:45] <warbler> Wipster: it is the official line - never needed it myself
[00:45] <zakman> not even like a apt-get upgrade? sorta thing?
[00:45] <Tortured> i have a fiesty laptop im trying to bring up a usb drive with thats plugged into a gutsy desktop. I have opened shared folders on the desktop, installed nfs, and added the laptops IP address to the usb drives available connections, but i dont see it on the network still? what am i missing
[00:45] <Allenwr> Where is the best place to find video drivers?
[00:45] <espen> garu now i cant even switch back to norwegian keyboard
[00:45] <airtonarantes> Fasm1, but with a time I guess that you can
[00:45] <Flannel> zakman: Because ubuntu is a time based release, which means major versions for things get frozen per release
[00:45] <Allenwr> I need one for a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200
[00:46] <Rabiddog> zakman, compile your own kernel :)
[00:46] <BrokenPipe> Did something change with how Xinerama is set in xorg.conf? I'm using the same config file and hardware, and with 7.10 xinerama is not working. Ideas?
[00:46] <zakman> i guess. i dont like to though.
[00:46] <Flannel> VousDeux: that way at least you'll know what versions you need to use (or what bug reports you need to file)
[00:46] <K3nt> can any wow users help me with it in ubuntu? i have wine
[00:46] <Wipster> warbler, I got tird of all the steps with my ati card back in the day, hence looking for an easier option
[00:46] <airtonarantes> Fasm1, Gutsy least is rather than Feisty
[00:46] <zakman> too much effect then when its in the official repo
[00:46] <K3nt> or even anybody that knows what to do lol
[00:46] <bluefox83> Tortured, you wont see nfs on the networks thingy for some reason...i think it's cus nfs isn't a browse-able protocol
[00:46] <Flannel> K3nt: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft
[00:46] <TravisAlaKing> k3nt, i'm playing now
[00:46] <nivekc1> how do i setup xorg??
[00:46] <K3nt> Flannel: did all that
[00:46] <FLSimpsonKPT> heyhey! Can anyone help me out with gutsy?
[00:46] <efpdv1> why isnt my soundcard being detected?
[00:46] <zakman> anyone use wubi?
[00:47] <MattJ> FLSimpsonKPT: If you ask a question, they can but try :)
[00:47] <bleubeard> nivekc1, you need to setup xorg in ubuntu?
[00:47] <Tortured> bluefox83, really .. boy that stinks .. so is there a network i can use thats browse-able?
[00:47] <K3nt> TravisAlaKing: do you remember what guide you followed? or maybe you just know what to do?
[00:47] <VousDeux> Flannel: Such as Hardy? or are you suggesting a completely different distro like Kanotix?
[00:47] <warbler> Wipster: ati needs better support - I here that is being worked on... - be  nice for christmas!
[00:47] <twilight> hello
[00:47] <TravisAlaKing> I used the link that was posted above.
[00:47] <K3nt> hmm
[00:47] <TravisAlaKing> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft
[00:47] <nivekc1> bleubeard: im trying to setup my PC with a widescreen resolution but i dont have any in the list i need to go in and add them to the ones i can use
[00:47] <TheRepacker> 1316 online right now, kinda crazy
[00:47] <efpdv1> wow
[00:48] <ArthurArchnix> VousDeux: You might consider running Sid.
[00:48] <bluefox83> Tortured, samba. but really once you mount the nfs share you can browse it with your file browser...it just wont show up in Places->network
[00:48] <efpdv1> maybe i should go google
[00:48] <twilight> i wanna know how can i remove the icons from the desktop the partitions
[00:48] <K3nt> did you run into any problems? like when you select your character and you go to connect but it goes black and white and closes?
[00:48] <chybeck> Hi , i've installed W3 but battlenet doesn't work "connection to battlenet" .. any idea ?
[00:48] <FLSimpsonKPT> How can i get my update manager to work again? When I installed gutsy it didn't automatically configure my Internet so it disabled the secure download server making it impossible for me to update. how can i fix this?
[00:48] <Crust> hmm
[00:48] <airtonarantes> Fasm1, I'll go to try here, if you wonder to know, send me a email to airton.arantes@gmail.com
[00:48] <TravisAlaKing> Anybody know how to switch from Gnash to Adobe Flash?
[00:48] <Tortured> bluefox83, ive got to mount the nfs via commandline?
[00:48] <twilight> in gutsy
[00:48] <twilight> i tried many things
[00:48] <bluefox83> Tortured, yeah...
[00:49] <ArthurArchnix> twightlight: 2 ways, one if you don't want any volumes on desktop you can disable the feature in gconf (bear in mind your ipod, cd rom etc won't show up when plugged in). Second is to change the mount point.
[00:49] <bluefox83> Tortured, you also need to define the directories you want to be shared in a config file...
[00:49] <twilight> thanks
[00:49] <Flannel> VousDeux: Right.  Hardy wont be out in any usable form for months at least.  And then it'll be unstable as hell.  Try some rolling release distro (one that updates all the time) to see if the newer versions work or not
[00:49] <D2006> hi!?
[00:49] <espen> Can someone help me to get my keyboard language back to norwegian?
[00:49] <MattJ> FLSimpsonKPT: Do you get a particular error message?
[00:49] <TravisAlaKing> k3nt, I didn't have any problems like that.  What kind of graphics card are you using?
[00:49] <Fastn> garu: i have a little problem, in windows i have the sound volume on 50% and have clear sound, in linux i dont hear much on 50% , i need atleast 80% to get good volume, whats wrong?
[00:49] <D2006> just installed 7.10 and xchat and never wanted to join this channel :O
[00:50] <K3nt> TravisAlaKing: Nvidia 8400 GSM
[00:50] <kevleviathan> does anybody have a moment for some troubleshooting
[00:50] <TravisAlaKing> Are you using the restricted driver or the free driver?
[00:50] <twilight> gconf? where is this thing
[00:50] <D2006> what's the problem with that, Fastn?
[00:50] <FLSimpsonKPT> MattJ: it was during the installation. I went and clicked through it quickly :\
[00:50] <Rob125> espen: settings->preferences->keyboards.
[00:50] <ArthurArchnix> D2006: Do you need help finding the door then?
[00:50] <Davy_Jones> how can i change the behavior of alt-right mouse button?
[00:50] <VousDeux> Flannel: I would prefer to stick with something Debian-based...perhaps I will have a look at that Sid as suggested by ArthurArchnix .
[00:50] <sn4k31> hi all
[00:51] <espen> Rob125 ye si know but when i set it as my choice it just desappears
[00:51] <sn4k31> guys
[00:51] <ArthurArchnix> twighlight: from terminal, do gconf-editor
[00:51] <D2006> not really. just my first use of xchat. used to use (:)) mIRC on windows
[00:51] <twilight> ok
[00:51] <MattJ> FLSimpsonKPT: Try looking in System->Administration->Software Sources
[00:51] <ArthurArchnix> then browse to apps, nautilus, desktop
[00:51] <Flannel> VousDeux: Debian would work fine, yeah.  Try testing, then if that doesnt work, try unstable.
[00:51] <Fastn> D2006: i dont get why i need the volume on max to get volume thats standard
[00:51] <ArthurArchnix> uncheck show mounted voumes
[00:51] <efpdv1> how do i get my soundcard to work
[00:51] <VousDeux> Flannel: however, I've gotten kind of attached to Ubuntu :/
[00:51] <twilight> ah now i remember
[00:51] <Fastn> D2006: i could be enough with 20% or 50% of the volume
[00:51] <jonfish> Anyone else have problems with fire fox using ALOT of cpu?
[00:51] <jonfish> I look at the CPU monitor when I close firefox and it goes from like 50% to 5
[00:51] <twilight> i have already activated this in the menu
[00:51] <chybeck> Hi , i've installed W3 but battlenet doesn't work "connection to battlenet" .. any idea ?
[00:51] <TravisAlaKing> how do i open the gnome configuration editor?
[00:51] <Flannel> VousDeux: well, you don't have to do it on a permanant basis.  Right now you just want to find out what kernel version supports your hardware (if any)
[00:51] <zakman> W3?
[00:51] <ian1> jonfish: depends what pages are open (Flash?)
[00:52] <sn4k31> guys when I do alsamixer in the terminal come this alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[00:52] <twilight> i have just switched from pclinuxos
[00:52] <chybeck> w3 = warcraft3
[00:52] <TLE> BrokenPipe: There is something in the release notes about that https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyGibbon/ReleaseNotes in the section "Dual-head (multi-screen) setups"
[00:52] <MattJ> TravisAlaKing: Alt+F2, type gconf-editor
[00:52] <sn4k31> how I can fix it????
[00:52] <zakman> o
[00:52] <twilight> i became very unstable
[00:52] <D2006> Fastn: maybe they just use another algorithms to calc the real volume. for instance: winamp on windows has 3 different ways to calc volume: linear, logarithmic and hypersomthing :)
[00:52] <twilight> thank you very much
[00:52] <ArthurArchnix> TravisAlaKing: In terminal type "gconf-editor"
[00:52] <ArthurArchnix> without quotes
[00:52] <Fastn> D2006: Okey, thx
[00:52] <kevleviathan> Does anybody know why USB hotplugging is not working in Gutsy? Usb disk / usb mouse do not work unless I boot with them plugged in
[00:52] <ian1> twilight: have some tea or something
[00:52] <radioaktivstorm> I did a fresh install of gutsy ubuntu and after toying around with it  realized it was a bit sluggish on my slow machine so i opted for xubuntu via aptitude, how do i remove the ubuntu-desktop metapackage such that all of the packages are removed and i just have xubuntu?
[00:52] <kevleviathan> after which I can plug/unplug all I want
[00:53] <Agent_bob> sn4k31 modprobe
[00:53] <xtlosx> guys im trying to update to gutsy, update-manager -d doesn't work, it's an up to date feisty install, the upgrade manager doesn't work... what the heck is going on?
[00:53] <Fasma_> finally! a freaking irc chat client! :)
[00:53] <zakman> xtlosx type apt-get dist-upgrade
[00:53] <Flannel> radioaktivstorm: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce
[00:53] <xtlosx> same result
[00:53] <sn4k31> alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such device
[00:53] <sn4k31> what is that???
[00:53] <zakman> apt-get update first.. xtlosx?
[00:53] <xtlosx> i did
[00:54] <xtlosx> apt-get update, updated apt-get dist-upgrade, nothing
[00:54] <xtlosx> says it's up to date
[00:54] <xtlosx> what the hell
[00:54] <radioaktivstorm> Flannel, thanks ill try that
[00:54] <xtlosx> do i have to change everything to gutsy in the sources.list ? I tried that too, and it still said it's all update to date
[00:54] <AngryElf> No Matter what resolution settings I pick my desktop is always bigger than my screen, e.g. moving the mouse to the edge scrolls the screen around -- nvidia card here, any ideas?
[00:54] <TravisAlaKing> Anybody know where to tell firefox to use flash instead of gnash?
[00:54] <Agent_bob> sn4k31 that's an error message telling you that the module for that hardware is not inserted
[00:54] <beerfan> The speed limit deluge plugin doesn't work for me (or works too well). It drops upload speed to 0.1kb no matter what I set. Anyone else see this?
[00:54] <ArthurArchnix> sn4k: what does this return #aplay -l
[00:54] <sn4k31> so what i have to do???
[00:54] <VousDeux> Flannel: I think I would rather take my chances with updating the kernel on what I already have, but will that mean that the restricted-modules will not work if I update the kernel?
[00:54] <xtlosx> anyone?
[00:54] <nickrud> AngryElf: look for the 'virtual' line in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[00:54] <xtlosx> What could be going on, I don't get it
[00:55] <nickrud> AngryElf: and delete it
[00:55] <xtlosx> I cannot upgrade this feisty box to gutsy
[00:55] <FLSimpsonKPT> mattJ: it worked! Thanks Man!
[00:55] <K3nt> TravisAlaKing: ok i got it started up, but my mouse is laggy in-game
[00:55] <Davy_Jones> xtlosx: did you try the update manager?
[00:55] <MattJ> FLSimpsonKPT: Great, no problem :)
[00:55] <xtlosx> yes
[00:55] <xtlosx> same thing, it says it is up to date
[00:55] <Fasma_> anyone on xchat? how do I hide the left pane with the list of networks?
[00:55] <FLSimpsonKPT> now i just need to get my restricted ati drivers working
[00:55]  * fdex hi
[00:55] <xtlosx> what the heck could be wrong?  it's my fiancee's laptop, she hasn't touuched a thing on it
[00:55] <Davy_Jones> xtlosx: it should say upgrade at the top
[00:55] <twilight> ian: tea? water is better for this time
[00:55] <xtlosx> I understand that, i upgraded my laptop at work
[00:55] <twilight> 3 am here in greece
[00:55] <VousDeux> Fasma_: I changed mine to tabbed mode.
[00:55] <atlfalcons866> what are extents
[00:55] <Crankymonky> Where is the option in Nautilus to show root folders on the left?
[00:56] <nickrud> Fasma_: drag the bar just to the right of the network list to the left
[00:56] <Fasma_> VousDeux: tabbed mode? I'll check it out
[00:56] <twilight> damn it havnt found it yet
[00:56] <TravisAlaKing> K3nt, is the mouse stuttering or just slow?
[00:56] <xtlosx> I can't seem to figure this out, and I have never seen this before, it's bizarre

[01:08] <K3nt> TravisAlaKing: k thanks for your help
[01:08] <Rob125> LifeSF -- you can copy a directory using the command 'sudo cp' -- eg: 'sudo cp ~/Desktop/my_html_file /var/www/a_folder'.
[01:08] <xtlosx> cliechti where in synaptic were you talking about
[01:08] <World> <stoodleysnow> right click name of channel and select close

[01:11] <pyrak> sammyf, i'm in the right dir, i just dont know how to run the install script
[01:11] <xtlosx> hmm.. I did it at work, downloaded all 800mb, but my fiancee's box should be an easy straight dist upgrade
[01:12] <matthew_> Hi, I upgraded to Gutsy and now I can't install or uninstall stuff via apt-get.  I tried uninstalling Rhythmbox but got an error.  Can someone take a look at this pastebin and help me?  thanks.  http://pastebin.ca/743002
[01:12] <xtlosx> but it doesn't see it. won't let me i've tried every whichi way
[01:12] <scrottles> hi
[01:12] <Agent_bob> i don't want to blindly answer NO   so can anyone help me with that ?
[01:12] <Seeker`> matthew_: its a problem with tzdata - dont know why though
[01:12] <scrottles> i installed swf-player   and mozilla-plugin-gnash  yet i still cannot get it working on firefox
[01:12] <localgod11> flick: best way is go get a them that looks like vista and run kde
[01:12] <scrottles> using you tube to test.
[01:12] <sammyF> pyrak: you want to run it from the gui or from the shell?
[01:12] <Seeker`> matthew_: try apt-get -f install
[01:12] <bluefox83> is there any particular reason why the update manager wont let you see what files it's installing?
[01:12] <scrottles> what are the package names to get flash working with firefox ?
[01:12] <pyrak> sammyf, shell
[01:12] <nibsa1242b> can someone point me to a good how to for sharing files/ folders/ printers across a LAN (I'm mainly interested in sharing between 2 Ubuntu systems, however, I do have an XP system that might like to access the shar as well).
[01:12] <localgod11> but imho i would go with compizfusion
[01:12] <scrottles> using apt-get
[01:12] <matthew_> Seeker`: ok thanks
[01:12] <Agent_bob> i heard that a caching proxy might help on a dialup connection    is true ?
[01:12] <ArthurArchnix> sn4k: Is this a gatewway laptop?
[01:13] <Fasma> newbie: how I can listen to mp3 streams with U7.10?  What do I need to install?
[01:13] <sammyF> pyrak, tried "./intall" ?
[01:13] <LifeSF> illegal operation
[01:13] <flick> localgod11, actually i'm not that keen to make it look like vista... unless there are other advantages of running KDE?
[01:13] <CroiX> The more I play around with Gnome, the more I like KDE.
[01:13] <LifeSF> illigal option i mean
[01:13] <sn4k31> is a toshiba satellite
[01:13] <sammyF> pyrak: without the quote of course
[01:13] <sn4k31> ArthurArchnix
[01:13] <flick> how large a download is KDE?
[01:13] <pyrak> sammyf, it says no such file or directoy
[01:13] <LifeSF> with the copy... coudl somone say it in pm? i get completely lost in the chatroom :S
[01:13] <nibsa1242b> scrottles: its something along the lines of flash-non-free, why not use synaptic? or just goto a site that needs flash and get the plugin... its basically the same
[01:13] <CroiX> I'm downloading Xubuntu too..I'll see how I like that.
[01:13] <Agent_bob> CroiX :)
[01:13] <bluefox83> this upgrade has been "modifying software channels" for almost 20 minutes :(
[01:13] <dn4> 26% [1 nexuiz-data 61255680/227MB 26%]                      1365B/s 1d 9h56m39s
[01:13] <ArthurArchnix> sn4k31 Ok, looking into it further at the moment, will pm you in a few minutes
[01:13] <sammyF> pyrak, huch ... you see the file when you do a ls?
[01:13] <mOrO^> bluefox83, it takes a while.
[01:14] <warbler> nibsal24b: heres a howto - http://www.ubuntugeek.com/nfs-server-and-client-configuration-in-ubuntu.html
[01:14] <viator> try flashplayer nonfree
[01:14] <nibsa1242b> warbler: thank you very much
[01:14] <pyrak> sammyF, if that means "dir", then yes
[01:14] <warbler> k
[01:14] <sammyF> nibsa1242b: in your case, you'll need samba share
[01:14] <localgod11> flick : dunno
[01:14] <Dumptruck> ok last question - why does it happen that when I am not doing anything on Ubuntu it sounds like my hard drive is being scanned? Can I stop this?
[01:14] <bluefox83> mOrO^, it's still "asking for confirmation"
[01:14] <pyrak> the file is called lxx74.install
[01:14] <CroiX> I have a feeling KDE will be my choice in the end
[01:14] <sn4k31> I'm here, please fix it
[01:14] <Agent_bob> CroiX i strongly believe that "default" should only be considered as a "starting poing on the long road to 'right'"
[01:14] <B_166-ER-X> gnome-control-cente
[01:14] <B_166-ER-X> doh sry
[01:14] <sammyF> pyrak: yes .. ls is the dir command for linux
[01:14] <Dumptruck> and is there something like peer guardian for Ubuntu?
[01:14] <B_166-ER-X> !mp3
[01:14] <flick> CroiX, why do you think KDE is better?

[01:14] <nibsa1242b> sammyF: ok thanks
[01:14] <sammyF> pyrak: try this :  "chmod 755 install"
[01:14] <Tortured> isnt there an easy way to have two ubuntu computers to share harddrives with each other in nautilus without passwords and crap?
[01:15] <sammyF> pyrak: then "./install"
[01:15] <CroiX> flick: because too much functionality is hidden or removed from Gnome
[01:15] <LifeSF> is there a way wo copy and delete files directly from within the gui into restricted access folders?
[01:15] <LM22> can anyone help me
[01:15] <bluefox83> Tortured, NFs
[01:15] <tigran> how can I show My Computer, Documents icons on the desktop? it was something you changed in gconf-editor, ive forgotten where tho
[01:15] <bluefox83> *NFS
[01:15] <ikaruga> help....
[01:15] <viator> try sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[01:15] <LM22> whenever I enable the nvidia driver I get stuck at 640X480
[01:15] <Tortured> bluefox83, its not easy
[01:15] <CroiX> flick: I think they have gone too far in trying to make it user friendly
[01:15] <ikaruga> i accidentally destroyed the hardrive w/ my home partition
[01:15] <pyrak> what's the command
[01:15] <pyrak> that's like
[01:15] <ikaruga> how can I get a working home partition up and running?
[01:15] <pyrak> 'run"
[01:15] <pyrak> or "execute"
[01:15] <Tortured> bluefox83, even the wiki page is complicated and drawn out
[01:15] <flick> CroiX, seems then i'll like KDE too... could you give some examples
[01:15] <mistone> is just me or gusty more buggy then any other ubuntu distro yet?
[01:16] <LM22> I thought we were getting a tool with xorg 7.3 to force refresh rates and resolutions to take care of this bug
[01:16] <bluefox83> Tortured, it's easy enough...you tell it what directories you want to share, and which machines are aloud to access them, and where you want them mounted...
[01:16] <Rob125> tigran: it's in apps -> nautilus in gconf
[01:16] <nibsa1242b> flick: CroiX: I would like KDE more if it didn't make me think Windows. I use Ubuntu because I want to be different, not run something that could be almost mistaken for XP so I prefer Gnome for now.
[01:16] <tigran> Rob125: thanks
[01:16] <Agent_bob> "<CroiX> flick: because too much ... removed from Gnome" <<< never was there.   can't be removed.
[01:16] <sammyF> Tortured: you have link to the wiki page? was looking for it right now ;)
[01:16] <Tortured> sammyF, just wiki.ubuntu.com search for nfs
[01:16] <sammyF> pyrak: no ... you just type the name of the command
[01:17] <LM22> anyone know how to force refresh rates in gutsy
[01:17] <LM22> and resolutions
[01:17] <Dumptruck> why does a program start and immediately vanish?
[01:17] <CroiX> Agent_bob: sure, I'll agree with that...sorry I mis-stated
[01:17] <sammyF> Tortured: sigh .. I was being lazy.. but thanks :)
[01:17] <shk> does anyone know how to fix compiz fusion after a gutsy upgrade?
[01:17] <Dumptruck> namely miro
[01:17] <flick> however, CroiX, removed or not if too much even was never there in gnome that could be a cause of worry for me too
[01:17] <nibsa1242b> mistone: other then their odd choice to use a buggy version of gimp I have yet to find a single bug in regular usage
[01:17] <pyrak> sammyF, it's not a command, it's a .install file
[01:17] <flick> CroiX, could you please cite some examples?
[01:17] <sammyF> pyrak: chmod just changes the attributes of the file
[01:17] <Agent_bob> Dumptruck start it in a terminal and see what error it's pukeing out.
[01:18] <sammyF> pyrak: may I ask what it installs?
[01:18] <ArthurArchnix> sn4k31 , sent you a pm with some stuff to try
[01:18] <pyrak> sammyf, a printer driver
[01:18] <mistone> nibsa1242b: installing it was a  bitch, it started out at 800x600 which is fine, but the install dialog box went below the screen :{
[01:18] <pyrak> for a lexmark x75
[01:18] <bluefox83> wow, ubuntu no longer offers support for xmms? interesting
[01:18] <reindeer> Are there any mirrors available for the Mac PPC ( G3 and later )downs of Ubuntu? IF so, what are the addys?
[01:18] <CroiX> flick: I haven't tried Gnome for several weeks, I would have to dig around a little, but the xchat interface is a good example...there is no way to use the tabbed channel mode which is really handy
[01:18] <viator> its lame but with ati you have to install the xgl
[01:18] <jrib> bluefox83: xmms is in universe
[01:18] <payan> !lvm
[01:18] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[01:19] <Dumptruck> when I start in the terminal it works fine
[01:19] <Tortured> CroiX, yah there is, youve got to install regular xchat not xchat-gnome
[01:19] <Dumptruck> ... hmm
[01:19] <nibsa1242b> mistone: from the live cd? I've never used a Ubuntu live cd. I've always done alternative install/ upgrade in place.
[01:19] <reindeer> Also, I need to know if anyone on this channel has any experience with a Mac PPC install of Ubuntu?
[01:19] <bastid_raZor> bluefox83: go VLC or Mplayer
[01:19] <flick> CroiX, if you mean xchat-gnome then i agree, i quickly rejected it... using xchat now
[01:19] <sammyF> pyrak: when you type more .install, does it look like a script?
[01:19] <mistone> nibsa1242b: oh ok
[01:19] <mistone> I just tried adding a folder from inside the open dialog and it said it couldn't find it lol
[01:19] <CroiX> Tortured: thanks for clearing that up for me
[01:19] <sammyF> pyrak: "more .install"
[01:19] <bluefox83> CroiX, remove xchat-gnome and install xchat-common and you get your tabs back in whatever window manager you want to use
[01:19] <matthew_> what's the name of the battery monitor application?
[01:19] <edubuntu> Help me Please!!!! I am so stupid
[01:19] <edubuntu> Anyone know alot about ext3?
[01:20] <h1st0>  /msg ubotu ssh
[01:20] <CroiX> bluefox83: okay, thanks
[01:20] <Agent_bob> sammyF maybe learn   "file"   file .install
[01:20] <edubuntu> LOL or sshfs?
[01:20] <localgod11> anyone have an opinion on 32 vs 64 bit?
[01:20] <mistone> lmao
[01:20] <shk> can anyone tell me how to get compiz to work after a gutsy upgrade?
[01:20] <mistone> gnome xchat just crashed
[01:20] <mistone> case and point
[01:20] <reindeer> edubuntu, you're not stupid. Just need more info from us, that's all.
[01:20] <edubuntu> Yeah
[01:20] <edubuntu> If you can help it would be amazing
[01:20] <wastrel> i like regular xchat batter
[01:20] <lomez> hi, my old disk i formatted was named sdb, now its disk. is there a way i can format the name?
[01:20] <mistone> reindeer don't jump to comclusions lol
[01:20] <jrib> localgod11: 32 unless you know exactly why you need it
[01:20] <mistone> haha
[01:20] <CroiX> my understanding is that anything you can install in gnome or kde can be installed in either one, let me dig around in the system stuff a little and see if I can find a better example
[01:20] <edubuntu> I just did a booboo on my server
[01:20] <mistone> comclusions
[01:20] <pyrak> sammf, i really think youre misunderstanding
[01:20] <YBH_1> is there anyway to upgrade 7.04 to 7.10 using the install CD? i found instructions for the alternate cd but not the install CD
[01:21] <csc`> Gursikh: nice cloak
[01:21] <localgod11> jrib: but wouldnt 64 be peppier?
[01:21] <Gursikh> csc`: THanks :-)
[01:21] <pyrak> sammyF, it's a file with extension .install
[01:21] <bluefox83> holy crap it's about time, the upgrade manager is just *now* downloading the upgrades
[01:21] <localgod11> i mean not faster per se but more responsive?
[01:21] <pyrak> sammyF, the file is called lxx74.install
[01:21] <Gursikh> You wouldn't happen to know how to make Firefox ignore my GTK theme?
[01:21] <sammyF> pyrak: lol ... okay .. I did misunderstand it :)
[01:21] <edubuntu> I was trying to get sshfs to work right and it mounted to a directory that i did not set the owner to me first
[01:21] <sammyF> pyrak: thought the file was called .install
[01:22] <edubuntu> I tried fusermount  -u umount  would not let me unbmount the fs
[01:22] <sammyF> Agent_bob: heh ... thanks ... never said I was a pro and it's always good to learn new stuff
[01:22] <reindeer> edubuntu, maybe you are able to assist with my efforts to dwon a Mac PPC variant of the latest stable release of Ubuntu. Would you have any info re: mirror sites?
[01:22] <edubuntu> Sooooo.. . . . I tried rm the dir and it removed half of  my storage
[01:22] <nibsa1242b> YBH_1: I think you have to use the alternate cd. And even then if you have any non-standard packages you end up waiting to dl their new versions.
[01:22] <edubuntu> I need to recover some files off of ext3
[01:23] <edubuntu> What do i do?/
[01:23] <sn4k31> arthurarchnic
[01:23] <sn4k31> arthurarchnix
[01:23] <Tempus> Hello all... I'm totally new to this (not to linux but to what i'm about to describe). I want to dual boot my laptop. It has Vista Business on it. What's the easiest way of going about repartitioning and installing Ubuntu without killing the Vista install?
[01:23] <CroiX> how do you modify keyboard shortcuts in gnome?
[01:23] <sn4k31> where did you sent a pm
[01:23] <sn4k31> ?
[01:23] <YBH_1> ok nibsa1242b
[01:23] <edubuntu> reindeer? any help?
[01:23] <wastrel> CroiX: system > preferences > keyboard shortcuts
[01:23] <mistone> Tempus: partition in vista first
[01:24] <edubuntu> i gotta get this 7 gb back
[01:24] <garu_> Tempus just recize ur partition where vista is...but, it is recommended to defrag the dik beforehand :o
[01:24] <Dicey> hey guys. I'
[01:24] <matthew_> what's the name of the battery monitor application?
[01:24] <Tempus> mistone: i tried to "Shrink" the partition... said it could only free up like 4 gigs
[01:24] <witless> compiz doesnneither my desktop nor my laptop support com
[01:24] <ArthurArchnix> sn4k31 Did you try that stuff I sent?
[01:24] <sn4k31>  /msg nickserv set unfiltered on
[01:24] <CroiX> wastrel: thanks...I must be blind
[01:24] <payan> can i get LVM at first install from Gutsy's disc?
[01:24] <warbler> edubuntu: oops - Actually, you can't! This is what one of the developers, Andreas Dilger, said about it:
[01:24] <warbler> In order to ensure that ext3 can safely resume an unlink after a crash, it actually zeros out the block pointers in the inode, whereas
[01:24] <warbler> ext2 just marks these blocks as unused in the block bitmaps and marks the inode as "deleted" and leaves the block pointers alone.
[01:24] <warbler> Your only hope is to "grep" for parts of your files that have been deleted and hope for the best.
[01:24] <Dicey> what size should I make my root partition. Is 10 gigs enough.
[01:24] <garu_> Tempus download a program called Paragon Partition Magic and recize it
[01:24] <wastrel> matthew_: you mean the one in the panel?
[01:24] <mistone> Tempus: what? are you sure that your harddrive isn't just full?
[01:25] <wastrel> Dicey: 10gigs should be fine
[01:25] <Tempus> mistone: sure not. the laptop is less than 6 weeks old
[01:25] <CrazyLucas> Hey guys! Anyone upgraded to Gutsy Gibbon already?
[01:25] <Dicey> thanks
[01:25] <reindeer> edubuntu, I could sure use the help straight away. I have Ubuntu 5.10 for the Mac PPC and just need a fresh upgrade to 7.10. Wouuld you be able to guide me to low-traffic mirrors sites?
[01:25] <mistone> It also has to do with continuous space
[01:25] <matthew_> wastrel:  the one that sits in the notification area:  it showed a green battery.
[01:25] <mistone> you can move stuff around so you get continious freespace
[01:25] <Tempus> mistone: so basically a defrag would help?
[01:25] <firefox90> what is that advanced compiz control panel install command?
[01:25] <edubuntu> Prolly better getting the iso off of a torrent
[01:26] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: easiest is to have a second hard drive for each OS. (remember Linux will boot from an external HD, XP won't I don't know about Vista). Otherwise, partition first in Windows and make sure you are comfortable with Grub syntax if you are going to use Grub to boot. I prefer Grub as it lets me have a custom graphical boot menu of my dogs.
[01:26] <mistone> Tempus: no thats what I mean
[01:26] <wastrel> matthew_: that's a panel applet, you can find it in "add to panel"
[01:26] <garu_> Tempus the best option u have anyway, is to get winXP and dual boot it with ubuntu.forget vista.I was in the same situation...vista somehow always manages to screw things up
[01:26] <nonrate> hi
[01:26] <PokoTao> Does wine 0.9.47 work with Gutsy?
[01:26] <nonrate> I think Ubuntu is radical
[01:26] <networkn> Hi There! I am trying to install 7.10 into a virtual machine, using virtual server, but I am getting emask errors? buffer overflow errors, right after I tell it to install/start ubuntu
[01:26] <mistone> hehe
[01:26] <Tempus> well i hate to dump vista
[01:26] <nonrate> It's your hardware
[01:27] <nonrate> You should definitely dump Vista
[01:27] <edubuntu> I love to dump vista
[01:27] <reindeer> Ubuntu would be radical if I am able to find a variant for my Mac G4.
[01:27] <matthew_> wastrel:  no, it's an application that sits in the notification area.  the one you're thinking of is called Battery Charge Monitor
[01:27] <Davy_Jones> Tempus: me too
[01:27] <edubuntu> It makes me happy to remove it from anysystem
[01:27] <sampson> for some reason kubuntu gutsy won't upgrade from beta to release
[01:27] <localgod11> Tempus: i dual boot vista
[01:27] <infornography> I just have a quick question regarding the new ubuntu, I was thinking of installing it fully encrypted on my laptop, I just want to know if there will be a significant performance drop with encryption.
[01:27] <garu_> Tempus Vista=Resource Hog
[01:27] <nonrate> Ubunutu should have a PPC build
[01:27] <mistone> garu_: its not really
[01:27] <localgod11> nonrate: it does
[01:27] <Tempus> agreed, garu_
[01:27] <sampson> right after it downloads the kernel it says there are 5 packages that are no longer supported and then it says i don't need to update
[01:27] <akaishi> any ideas how I could start from an existing 6.06 install that has a bunch of corrupted files and re-install it via internet connection?
[01:27] <nonrate> not signifigant, unless your running a pentium II
[01:27] <mistone> it uses all that ram as cache
[01:27] <CaBlGuY> !real
[01:27] <ubotu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:28] <mistone> like yea it says its using all your ram
[01:28] <Tempus> localgod11: how did you do it successfully?
[01:28] <reindeer> Vista is nothinig short of a cheap Mac riop-off courtesy of the Evil Empire( MS ).
[01:28] <mistone> but its atcaully doing something smart
[01:28] <localgod11> install vista first thenubuntu
[01:28] <mistone> that being said
[01:28] <PokoTao> Anyone? Does WINE 0.9.47 (latest release) work in Gutsy? Running ./configure gives me an error.
[01:28] <dxdt> nonrate: they used to have them, they dropped it when apple dropped PPC basically.  It now exists unofficially I believe--maintained by the community only.
[01:28] <localgod11> where are u running into a problem?
[01:28] <mistone> its retarded
[01:28] <nonrate> it allocates almost all ram in the newer linux kernels
[01:28] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: really if you can afford it or have an extra HD around just put Ubuntu on its own HD.
[01:28] <networkn> is ubuntu compatible with loading from a mounted iso vis daemon tools?
[01:28] <steven_Office> LOL
[01:28] <garu_> mistone yes it is, and not only because I'm saying so, it is proved...u shouldnt even dare to say no to that :o!but hey...that's ur opinion :o
[01:28] <matthew_> wastrel: found it, called gnome-power-manager
[01:28] <sampson> PokoTao: i am running a pre-made deb i had found of .47
[01:28] <nonrate> dxdf: no rogue builds out there?
[01:28] <surlyduff> hi.  my usb wireless adapter isn't working on 7.10.  is there some trick to setting it up?
[01:28] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: this is a laptop
[01:28] <mistone> garu_:ok I am not denying its a resource hog
[01:28] <flick> which package contains the openssl/sha.h include file?
[01:28] <mistone> but its not THAT bad
[01:28] <dxdt> nonrate: well, that is my point, all builds now a days will be rogue builds.  They aren't officially supported.
[01:28] <steven_Office> drop vista it will be your best move
[01:28] <PokoTao> sampson: where did you find it?
[01:29] <dystopianray> networkn: you want to mount the ubuntu livecd in daemon tools?
[01:29] <mistone> its pretty bad tho
[01:29] <sampson> i don't remember...let me check my cache
[01:29] <garu_> Tempus my laptop came pre-installed with vista, and, in less than a month, I had problems
[01:29] <localgod11> tempus: mines a laptop and i dont have a problem
[01:29] <Tempus> localgod11: yeah i gather that... but surely it's a little more complicated than that
[01:29] <viator> use a live cd to partion
[01:29] <PokoTao> ok, thanks
[01:29] <localgod11> not really
[01:29] <garu_> Tempus wireless is a big pain in the arse on it
[01:29] <Eagle3--> is there any documentation on the new screen and graphics configuration tool in gutsy?
[01:29] <reindeer> Nonrate, how would I be able to secure a copy of 7.10 for my G4( Sawetooth )?
[01:29] <edubuntu> or you could even download gparted live cd
[01:29] <edubuntu> like partition magic almost pretty gui
[01:29] <localgod11> Garu: my wireless work fine using restriced drivers
[01:29] <stinger05> if i choose the 1st option while installing ubuntu (the one which chooses free space) does it create a new partition? if so, would it be a secondary or primary partition?
[01:29] <garu_> mistone when u say its not that bad, what r u comparing to?
[01:29] <viator> try gparted live cd
[01:30] <nonrate> reindeer: I'm not sure, I acutally use openSuse atm but am thinking of using Ubuntu8
[01:30] <Eagle3--> I can't seem to get nvidia twinview to work correctly unless I hard code the xorg.conf, which seems to deafeat the purpose
[01:30] <Zombine> Where can I find the sudoers file?
[01:30] <viator> or something
[01:30] <Eagle3--> Zombine: /etc
[01:30] <edubuntu> also has a usb setup to convert iso to usb boot great for partition needs
[01:30] <sampson> http://mepislovers.org/forums/showthread.php?p=80700
[01:30] <mistone> garu_: the resources that a modern computer has
[01:30] <localgod11> Tempus: private message
[01:30] <Zombine> Eagle3-- Thank you
[01:30] <Tempus> localgod11: my only worry is that i've never dual booted anything before
[01:30] <sampson> worked fine in gutsy
[01:30] <Bsims> Grrr... tried upgrading from the alternate cd and it didn't work quite right so now I am trying to upgrade via the normal way
[01:30] <nonrate> problem I have with ubuntu right now is I am a developer and use KDE, Ubuntu is not exactly developer or KDE friendly out of t6he box
[01:30] <garu_> mistone would u consider a Core 2 Duo with 1 Gig of RAM or even 2, a modern computer?
[01:30] <PokoTao> sampson: alright, thanks a ton.
[01:30] <mistone> garu_: yea fo sure
[01:30] <nonrate> but it's fantastic as a Vista replacement, better than openSuse for that
[01:30] <viator> i use dban and gparted
[01:30] <Eagle3--> can anyone point me to some help on the new screen and graphics tool?  specifically for getting dual monitors to work with an nvidia card
[01:31] <dystopianray> nonrate: why not use kubuntu?
[01:31] <garu_> mistone how come it still struggles with vista? :s
[01:31] <zakman> any Duo =  modern pc? :P
[01:31] <stinger05> if i choose the 1st option while installing ubuntu (the one which chooses free space) does it create a new partition? if so, would it be a secondary or primary partition?
[01:31] <mistone> garu_: "struggle?"
[01:31] <Bsims> 1248 of 1922 files fsck
[01:31] <mistone> it works for me
[01:31] <localgod11> garu: me 2
[01:31] <networkn> how much disk space does a full gutsy install need? would 10GB cover it?
[01:31] <Eagle3--> stinger05: I would think it depends on how your current partitions are setup
[01:31] <garu_> mistone check this out...start your machine, but dont do anything, u'll notice that, even though u'r not doing anything, the hdd is working like hell...
[01:31] <dystopianray> networkn: 10GB should be fine
[01:32] <mistone> garu_: wow. so what
[01:32] <mistone> it works fine
[01:32] <Eagle3--> networkn: depends on what you want to install, but yet that would probably be fine
[01:32] <dystopianray> networkn: only uses a few GBs or so
[01:32] <nonrate> dystopianray: I haven't tried it yet, but I may soon
[01:32] <localgod11> garu_: nope
[01:32] <Fastn> Can someone explain why my downloads are so slow, i download in 3,11kb
[01:32] <mistone> trust me I hate vista as much as the next guy
[01:32] <reindeer> Ok, nonrate. Does Novell maintain a Mac PPC variant for openSuSE atm?
[01:32] <Bsims> Hrm does the ubuntu install have to overright home etc
[01:32] <Coolin> can ubuntu resize ntfs partitions?
[01:32] <nonrate> openSuse 10.3 failed to upgrade, and a reinstall was horrible
[01:32] <mistone> but alot of poeples arguements suck
[01:32] <stinger05> eagle3--: i have 2 partions with windows xp installed
[01:32] <russ> hi there!  is there a simple way to play sims on ubuntu, i have downloaded wine, but would be happy for a quick solution, rather than to read war and peace...
[01:32] <PriceChild> !offtopic | reindeer nonrate mistone
[01:32] <dystopianray> Bsims: ubuntu install takes about 15-20 minutes
[01:32] <ubotu> reindeer nonrate mistone: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[01:32] <garu_> mistone and also, u know one of the weirdest things that microsoft said about vista "one of its innovative features is to anticipate what the user is going to do next"!lol
[01:32] <mistone> haha ok
[01:32] <nonrate> uboto: thanks for the info
[01:33] <Bsims> I don't wanna wipe my /etc/ and home though
[01:33] <dystopianray> russ: did you install the sims in wine?
[01:33] <moDumass> morning all, all bright eyed and bushy tailed.. how are we doing? ps, my ktorrent is in hidden (cant see it but system processes says its going) mode, how do i make it visible?
[01:33] <viator> i think he is just partioning the FREESPACE
[01:33] <flick> ok never mind, i found the openssl/sha.h, it's in libssl-dev package
[01:33] <moDumass> im guty gibboning
[01:33] <Eagle3--> stinger05: if there's room for a primary partition I assume it would create one...never tried it though...I always use manual setup
[01:33] <garu_> mistone my lecturer wasted 35 minutes of the lecture just talking about that.lol

[01:33] <h1st0> Okay i'm trying to get ssh working from the outside world.  It works fine from inside the lan.  So i'm assuming its a port forwarding issue on my router.  I hve a dsl router which is connected to a linksys router to serve my network.  The dsl router has an external ip but hte linksys has an internal ip.  I tried adding the port forward on the linksys but its not working any ideas?
[01:33] <Eagle3--> is anyone familiar with setting up dual monitors in gutsy?
[01:33] <russ> dystopianary, no, how do i do that?
[01:33] <viator> his hd might be 200gb and all ntfs except 4-8 gb
[01:33] <Eagle3--> I've done it by editing xorg.conf in feisty...but I can't figure out the new config tool
[01:33] <akaishi> I need to do an install of ubuntu without a CD. Ideas?
[01:33] <dipu> Hi there .. i have a SONY VAIO laptop ...i wanted to get my web-cam MOTION EYE working on ubuntu 7.10 ...any idea
[01:33] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: fun! I think Ubuntu wouldn't mind booting from a USB or Firewire drive... Or if you reinstall Windows, you can always partition the drive that way. There is always, gparted should be on the live CD... I think that can resize NTFS partitions.
[01:33] <kibble> akaishi: usb key?
[01:34] <dystopianray> russ: insert your 'the sims' cd into your computer, open a terminal and run: wine /media/cdrom0/setup.exe (or install.exe or whatever it uses)
[01:34] <akaishi> the only one I have is 256 mb
[01:34] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: noted. thanks, may give that a shot
[01:34] <russ> dystopianray, will give it a go
[01:34] <viator> resize the ntfs windows partion to less than half the size of the hd
[01:34] <lashmoove> im on a live tribe4 cd of gutsy, kubuntu, i dont want to overwrite my /home partition, so i want to mount one so i can see the contetnts, but im getting this "hal-storage-fixed-mount refused uid 999" when i right click to mount in konqueror
[01:34] <networkn> sadly I don't think gutsy will install using MS virutal server
[01:34] <VousDeux> okay, so I uninstalled xchat-gnome and it's components. then I installed xchat-common, but there is no longer an icon on the menu to launch it...how do I launch it now?
[01:34] <kibble> akaishi: hmmm, I know there is a way, just nothing copy and paste easy
[01:34] <underwatercow> is it normal to be getting errors now when trying to update gutsy? like : Err http://us.archive.ubuntu.com gutsy-updates/main tzdata 2007h-0ubuntu0.7.10
[01:34] <underwatercow>   404 Not Found [IP: 91.189.88.31 80]
[01:35] <reindeer> Nonrate & edubuntu, IU appreciate y'all for your assistance. I'll need to dig a bit deepoer to find ubuntu 7.10 or Ubuntu8 for my PPC. Thank you and good night.
[01:35] <networkn> exception emask sact
[01:35] <akaishi> I could do a local net install if I had another machine but I don't
[01:35] <cafuego> underwatercow: yes
[01:35] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: its in system->administration->partition editor and if it isn't on the live cd, google for sysrescuecd or gparted live cd. the gparted live cd is under 50MB and should be able to help you.
[01:35] <viator> make a launcher
[01:35] <underwatercow> cafuego: thanks
[01:35] <Eagle3--> is anyone familiar with setting up dual monitors in gutsy? I've done it by editing xorg.conf in feisty...but I can't figure out the new config tool
[01:35] <World> Can any one assist a new person with instaling Java on 7.10?
[01:35] <d00c4> I have problem with setting up my resolution to 1680x1050. I have MSI RX2600PRO and LG L204WS. When I install drivers, Ubuntu reports that no screen is found and won't start X. Is there any solution, or I should change mi VGA to nVidia?
[01:35] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: awesome
[01:35] <dystopianray> World: jre or jdk? 1.5 or 1.7?

[01:36] <dystopianray> World: 1.5 or 1.6 i mean
[01:36] <NeanT> I'm trying to install ET:Quake Wars Demo on Gutsy x64 but all I get is this in a terminal "bash: ./ETQW-client-1.1.r8.x86.run: No such file or directory"   (I did a chmod 755 to the file)
[01:36] <kibble> Eagle3--: I setup my internal lcd and external tv/lcd, didn't know gusty had a tool for that, I had to edit xorg.conf by hand
[01:36] <dystopianray> NeanT: does that file actually exist in the current directory?
[01:36] <World> jrib thanks didn't see that.
[01:36] <VousDeux> I know I could go to the command-line and launch xchat, but is that what they had in mind? or is something broken?
[01:36] <bluebanana> can someone put onto pastebin the _official" sources.list as if one were doing a fresh install from iso? Thank you!!!!!
[01:36] <dipu> how can i test my web-cam is being detected by gusty ?? I have a sony VAIO MOTION EYE
[01:37] <YBH_1> when doing the distribution upgrade for 7.10 from the Update Manager where are the downloaded files located at?
[01:37] <Eagle3--> kibble: that's what I did in feisty...edited by hand...but the new screen and graphics tool lets you change configuration without restarting X...it seems like  maybe it's not fully functional so I might have to just resort to editing xorg.conf
[01:37] <kibble> NeanT: it's a shell script and binary. you don't have the correct version, it's a 32bit and you need a 64bit version
[01:37] <Eagle3--> kibble,it would just be nice to be able to disable a secondary monitor without restarting X
[01:37] <gore_> why isn't mpeg123 in the repositories anymore
[01:37] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: and I think if you defrag first it might help, but I don't really know anymore. Its been so long since I had to figure out how to set up a dual boot on one hd.
[01:37] <Fastn> Can someone explain why my downloads are so slow, i download in 3,11kb
[01:37] <kibble> Eagle3--: I'm a slack man from 95ish, I'm used to it :)
[01:37] <VousDeux> maybe xchat-gnome is a good example of how gnome removes functionality
[01:37] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: well, like i said, i've never done it before
[01:37] <system_> hola
[01:37] <kibble> Fastn: what are you downloading?
[01:37] <AndrewRy> I'm trying to install Ubuntu, and stupidly, I accidently formatted my blank partition as NTFS. What filesystem does ubuntu install on so I can reformat the drive for it to work?
[01:37] <akaishi> Fastn, I'm told 9528543 people are downloading from the ubuntu servers right now
[01:37] <system_> gringossssssssssssssssss
[01:38] <kibble> AndrewRy: try ext3
[01:38] <Eagle3--> kibble: slack was actually my first distro from back in the 90's...so I don't mind...I just like to be spoiled sometimes :-)
[01:38] <VousDeux> AndrewRy: I would suggest ext3
[01:38] <AndrewRy> Okay, thanks
[01:38] <Dyus> EXT3
[01:38] <caller> quit
[01:38] <Fastn> kibble: bittorrent
[01:38] <system_> perrossssssss
[01:38] <kibble> Eagle3--: there is probably something that will do it, but I never really looked
[01:38] <jrib> system_: stop
[01:38] <YBH_1> AndrewRy, you can format the HD from the install CD. It uses ext3 format
[01:38] <kibble> Fastn: how many seeders/leachers?
[01:38] <AndrewRy> I just hope I don't screw up my windows partition doing this.
[01:38] <Fastn> akaishi: i dont download from ubuntu, i download from a random site
[01:38] <Eagle3--> kibble: well Xorg in gutsy has extensions built in to change things on the fly...just gotta figure out how to do it
[01:39] <d00c4> I have problem with setting up my resolution to 1680x1050. I have MSI RX2600PRO and LG L204WS. When I install drivers, Ubuntu reports that no screen is found and won't start X. Is there any solution, or I should change mi VGA to nVidia?
[01:39] <Fastn> kibble: 3 seeders, 1 leacher
[01:39] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: I think the worst part of it was that at the time I had to hand configure GRUB... I think the installer takes care of it by itself now.

[01:39] <ubotu> system_: Si busca ayuda en Español por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, allí obtendrá mas ayuda.
[01:39] <kibble> Fastn: well that doesn't sound like very many. that might be the problem
[01:39] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: good to know
[01:39] <AndrewRy> YBH_1: I'm using the GParted program it has on the CD to do it, since the install froze up at the partitioner loading screen last time I tried.
[01:39] <YBH_1> ok then just format for ext3
[01:39] <networkn> how do I add noacpi to the install of gutsy
[01:39] <networkn> ?
[01:39] <moDumass> hmm, if ktorrent is running, but theres no task bar icon and no window to minimise or maximise how do i make it visible in gui?
[01:39] <akaishi> is it possible to boot the livecd and have it do a net install to a hard drive?
[01:40] <nalioth> World: java is available in the standard repos now.  no need for any 3d party repos
[01:40] <DerDritte> Since I upgraded to 7.10 firefox went crazy, anyone got same?
[01:40] <kibble> Fastn: I'd downloading something using bt now and there is 2k seeders but I'm still only getting 54k/s
[01:40] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: just make sure if you can that you have a second computer nearby with Internet access. That way if you get stuck you can ask questions or google for answers and you should be fine. And of course, backup any data you don't want to use just in case something goes wrong.
[01:40] <YBH_1> DerDritte, what do you mean crazy?
[01:40] <kibble> DerDritte: crazy how?
[01:40] <DerDritte> Freezes from time to time...
[01:40] <VousDeux> DerDritte: sorry, not I...mine works fine, but I've been using Gutsy for quite awhile
[01:41] <AndrewRy> My install is still freezing at the "Starting up the partitioner screen", is it because of bad hardware, or filesystem (I know my Windows runs fine on this machine, too).
[01:41] <YBH_1> DerDritte, try emptying the cache for firefox
[01:41] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: right. i have no shortage of computers and hopefully no shortage of HD space... but the computer is so new i think i'd be okay if i had to wipe it clean
[01:41] <viator> cafuego you are pretty knowlegeable when it comes to wireless
[01:41] <kibble> DerDritte: yeah actually mine did that to, but it wasn't as annoying as the caret focus thing, once I turned that off I haven't noticed it crash once, F7 btw
[01:41] <nibsa1242b> Tempus: well then... less risk if something goes wrong
[01:41]  * cafuego hides
[01:41] <Tempus> nibsa1242b: indeed
[01:41] <viator> why is it when im using the bcm43xx my touchpad mouse goes nuts
[01:42] <DerDritte> kibble: ?
[01:42] <edubuntu> AndrewRy I had that problem today
[01:42] <bluebanana> To those who have done a fresh install using Ubuntu7.10 iso: please post the official Sources.list onto pastebin (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/). Thank you.
[01:42] <oam_> hi all ... just upgraded from 7.04 to 7.10 , and am having problems with my Binary only Nvidia drivers ...
[01:42] <Fasma> newbie Q: what do I have to do to listen to mp3 streams with U 7.10 on a live-cd? that damn Rhythmbox craps out  too often
[01:42] <cafuego> viator: Dunno, that sounds very odd, not something I've heard about before.
[01:42] <VousDeux> who was asking me (CroiX) about the functionality difference between kde and gnome?
[01:42] <viator> it never did it dapper etc then in fiessty it started
[01:42] <edubuntu> It was actually becaue the ntfs was corrupted if i waited about 10 minutes it would load up with he partition data
[01:42] <AndrewRy> What did you do to make it stop?
[01:42] <rtan> hello
[01:42] <viator> in gutsy too
[01:42] <edubuntu> deleted the ntfs partition completely
[01:42] <rtan> anybody know the link to download gusty dvd
[01:42] <oam_> i think i have a driver direct from Nvidia's page that is causing me problems ... how can i check the version of the driver to find out what file 7.10 is trying to use
[01:43] <kibble> DerDritte: I'm not sure if I turned it on or last time I updated firefox it turned it on, but I got a cursor everywhere, even when there wasn't input boxes. that's caret focus, when I turned that off everything else seemed to land in place, including the freezing
[01:43] <viator> the mouse server or what ever starts and restarts
[01:43] <akaishi> this would all be easier if firefox segfaulting wasn't part of the problem :/
[01:43] <viator> over and over
[01:43] <viator> but ONLY if i use the bcm43xx
[01:43] <edubuntu> When i checked onthe errormesszges that it was outputting it said to boot under windpws and run chkdisk-f and reboot twice before it could make alterations to the ntfs partition
[01:43] <kibble> rtan: tried www.ubuntu.com?
[01:43] <CarlF1> oam_:  cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version
[01:43] <DerDritte> kibble: it's just firefox that freezes...
[01:43] <edubuntu> sincei did not want anywindows at all i deleted the whole partition
[01:43] <viator> if i use the linuxtant driver loader it doesnt do it
[01:43] <AndrewRy> Okay, I'll probably just reformat this harddrive and then start from scratch. I don't have too much on my windows partition as it is, so it wouldn't be a problem. Anything to start using ubuntu. Thanks for the help.
[01:44] <NeanT> anybody experienced problems with bootsplash in Gutsy x64 ? my monitor goes in standby between GRUB selection and Login screen..
[01:44] <K3nt> when i go to my other desktop, ubuntu freezes
[01:44] <edubuntu> check the fourth terminal
[01:44] <DerDritte> kibble: I don't think it's got anything to do with compiz or such...
[01:44] <viator> i file a bug
[01:44] <edubuntu> ctrl+alt F4
[01:44] <rtan> kibble : i got gusty cd rom but i wonder the dvd iso is available
[01:44] <viator> they say its a KNOWN bug
[01:44] <kibble> DerDritte: I never mentioned compiz
[01:44] <viator> but i sat its a REGRESSION after dapper
[01:44] <eugo> hey when copying files with scp, some special characters like í show up weird after transfer. they are fine on the host computer (ubuntu gutsy)
[01:44] <bluebanana> My upgrade windows says "Running Partial Upgrade". After this "partial upgrade" is over, can I upgrade everything else that wasn't upgraded? Thank you!
[01:44] <DerDritte> kibble: "or such"...
[01:45] <oam_> carlFL : /proc/driver/nvidia/version does not currently exist ... i should have said before , that to get X to load i had to manually switch back to the "nv" driver
[01:45] <kibble> rtan: probably. haven't looked, if it's not something they advertise on the front page might not be ready
[01:45] <phaedra> rtan, Yes, There's a torrent for it.
[01:45] <JensenDied> so, compiz seems to be eating part of my screen...
[01:45] <kibble> oh guess I should look before I speak
[01:45] <kibble> JensenDied: how so?
[01:45] <oam_> should i change back, and reboot to check the driver version , then reboot again to report back ??
[01:45] <kibble> or maybe he should have looked before he asked :)
[01:45] <rtan> phaedra: any link  ? ftp?
[01:46] <viator> thinks ..............screen must be tasty
[01:46] <phaedra> rtan, It's on linuxtracker.org
[01:46] <kibble> rtan: torrent would be prefered, a lot of people grabbing the ftp now, torrent would be much faster
[01:46] <JensenDied> kibble: well, my screen size that is started with X is a bit smaller than i like, so i have xrandr resize it, however everything not in that initial size doesnt display, background, menubar etc... since the update
[01:46] <kibble> a friend of mine got it last night via http, took him 6 hours
[01:46] <Flanger> So, I've just installed Gutsy... I don't know if there's anyone of the Ubuntu/Canonical team now online, but Gratz to everyone that made this release possible... thanks all!
[01:46] <packetgod> Cool thing about the torrent is the more people grabbing it the faster it goes
[01:47] <kibble> JensenDied: so they aren't on the screen at all?
[01:47] <dxdt> How do I increase the number of desktops from 2 to 4?
[01:47] <B_166-ER-X> I just installed Gutsy, i want to know how to make my other Hd (on windows) automatically shop up on the desktop on startup ?  also, if i can give it a name other than 'Disk' 'Disk-1' ect.. ?   please
[01:47] <itnomad> can one upgrade from the live cd? or, must it be a clean install?
[01:47] <eugo> i have a windows partition with some special characters (like "týr") which show up fine in gutsy, but when copying with scp, the filenames end up funny
[01:47] <bluebanana> Why does my ugrade window say "Running PARTIAL upgrade"??? How can I make the upgrade a FULL one?
[01:47] <kibble> itnomad: do you have ubuntu installed now? what version
[01:47] <sampson> gaah
[01:48] <itnomad> kibble: I have feisty
[01:48] <JensenDied> kibble: its probably due to some of the missing compiz-fusion stuff in the default im gonna try a few more things first, just kinda wierd
[01:48] <sampson> why the fuck won't my beta upgrade to final
[01:48] <kibble> bluebanana: there was a problem upgrading everything at once. it has to upgrade a bit at a time
[01:48] <rtan> phaedra: found the torrent for 7.1 DVD, its 4.23GB . Thanks
[01:48] <RadicalDreamer> Hello.
[01:48] <bluebanana> kibble: is this normal?
[01:48] <smallfoot-> I installed Gutsy Gibbon today, and it did not detect my computer monitor, I had to browse a list, and select it. Also, I cant change refresh rate, to more than 50-55 Hz on 1280x1024, even though my monitor runs 85hz in Windows
[01:48] <itnomad> got the bittorrent live CD this afternoon
[01:48] <phaedra> rtan, Okay....  :)

[01:48] <B_166-ER-X> is there a way to config the 'compiz' desktop ? like in Beryl ?
[01:48] <Megaqwerty> tracker has been taking 100% CPU for the past few days...any idea why? Or...how I could check it's status, like you can with beagle?
[01:48] <itnomad> but I don't see the option to upgrade when booting the CD
[01:48] <RadicalDreamer> I have a problem. MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[01:48] <bluebanana> kibble: i think i'ts because i closed the upgrade window.
[01:49] <kibble> JensenDied: I have a 950 gma or something and run at 1280x800, X new it was bigger then 1024x768 but for some reason wasn't telling gnome, I was hoping that;s what you meant because I solved that
[01:49] <RadicalDreamer> My computer is an Acer Aspire 1605LC, a laptop.
[01:49] <eugo> nobody knows why special characters mess up in filenames after scp transfer?
[01:49] <kibble> bluebanana: wouldn't be the first time I've done that
[01:49] <PokoTao> sampson: are you still on?
[01:49] <RadicalDreamer> Any ideas?
[01:49] <phaedra> RadicalDreamer, I have the same problem, Just add noapic to the boot parameters.
[01:49] <Flats> Anyone feel like taking a shot helping me figure out my intel wireless 3945ABG adapter? It shows in sudo lshw -C network but no drivers at all. Liek the software doesn't see it

[01:49] <unstable> What can I use to test my webcam that comes with Gutsy by default?
[01:49] <darkzero> Hey all
[01:49] <flick> how can i change the alt-tab interface to show smaller icons?
[01:50] <JensenDied> kibble: well thats not what i meant to be talking about, but while were there, how did you solve that since that something else ive been putting off fixing?
[01:50] <kevinO> hello I have an unformatted partion that is not being used, how can i utilize this partition in ubuntu
[01:50] <RadicalDreamer> Okay. Thank you.
[01:50] <darkzero> Does anyone here know anything about mplayer?
[01:50] <nibsa1242b> Flats: good luck, I am told most intel adapters have good support.
[01:50] <nunofgs> can anyone help me out with netatalk? I installed it but when I try to connect the server, it asks me for my user/pass and then says there was an unexpected error
[01:50] <RobotBanana> Does anyone know how you can specify to use a static IP on one wireless network while still keeping roaming mode on?
[01:50] <phaedra> RadicalDreamer, You might have to add nolapic also...
[01:50] <kibble> JensenDied: I assume an intel video then? yeah I found a web site that had the fix, lemme find it
[01:50] <Flats> thats what they tell me but I've been trying for two days with no luck
[01:50] <Megaqwerty> Tracker has been taking 100% CPU for the past few days...any idea why? Or...how I could check it's status, like you can with beagle?
[01:50] <Flats> worked in 7.04 but dead in 7.1
[01:51] <moDumass> ok, no ktorrent people, man, why forth art ktorrent doing this to me... whyyyyy whyyyyyyyy?
[01:51] <JensenDied> kibble: well this is an nvidia card on this machine, but its probably a similar issue
[01:51] <nibsa1242b> RobotBanana: I think if you have control of the DHCP server on the wireless network, you can set it so that it always assigns a particular client the same IP.
[01:51] <Cryoniq> Why is it that graphics totaly pecks up when I install xserver-glx when using the ATI/AMD drivers fglrx with my ATI9800 Pro?
[01:51] <dmandell> Is anybody here familiar with the Compiz Window Switcher settings?
[01:51] <eugo> darkzero: all i know i learned through http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mplayer
[01:51] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: depends, what do you want to do?
[01:51] <arjones85> i have an interesting issue hopefully somebody can help me with. for some reason the mouse pointer is grey when I choose "clearglass" under appearance settings on laptop A, but white when I choose "clearglass" on laptop B
[01:51] <RobotBanana> nibsa1242b: But is it possible to do that within Ubuntu? I'm pretty sure you can do it. Hell, my iPod touch can do it...
[01:51] <arjones85> how the heck do I make it white like it is on laptop B
[01:51] <Fasma> what?? I can't play mp3 in Ubuntu 7.10? There must be some mistake - and I'm a newbie... but I can't play either mp3 on my pc or mp3 streams! any solutions?
[01:51] <darkzero> thx
[01:51] <bluebanana> kibble: so how do i make the PARTIAL upgrade a COMPLETE one later on?
[01:52] <dmandell> Megaqwerty: I don't want it to bring the window to the front when I'm switching between windows
[01:52] <RobotBanana> nibsa1242b: I just want it to remember settings for a certain network.
[01:52] <aro> Fasma, mp3 format is not free, therefore it cannot be packaged in the default install, you have to install mp3 support after
[01:52] <Cryoniq> Right now I got it working fine after uninstalled the amd package and the ati package, then the propriatary driver started working very nice.. but cannot still (!) start compiz etc.
[01:52] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: using Alt+Tab?
[01:52] <dmandell> Megaqwerty: In the Application Switcher settings I unchecked "Bring to front", but that doesn't seem to do anything.
[01:52] <kibble> bluebanana: just run it again, usually when I see that and I haven't closed the upgrade window it's because you need to reboot or something before it can complete the file upgrade
[01:52] <dmandell> Megaqwerty: that's right.
[01:52] <otzi48>  8-)
[01:52] <nibsa1242b> RobotBanana: I imagine you can, either with config files or scripts. But I wouldn't know how. I would figure the simplest way would be through the DHCP server if you have access.
[01:52] <Cryoniq> sorry under Gutsy..
[01:52] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: I'll check it out.
[01:53] <RobotBanana> Hmm... Alright, thanks nibsa1242b.
[01:53] <darkzero> <eugo>You know why when I play a ogn video file, it show it big on my monitor?
[01:53] <kibble> bluebanana: well not reboot, but sometimes like upgrading dpkg before you can install some new ones, it doesn't do it all at once it will do a partial

[01:53] <Mulder> is setting up fglrx on ubuntu 7.10 with compiz still messy ? or is it point clicky click
[01:53] <dmandell> Megaqwerty:  Thanks, I just updated from Feisty to Gutsy today and it's driving me a bit batty.
[01:53] <Fasma> aro: do you know an easy way to install mp3 support for a live-cd run of Ubuntu 7.10?
[01:53] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: on most ATI hardware you have to install xgl-server to get compiz to work. Esp. if yo use the proprietray driver.
[01:53] <arjones85> i have an interesting issue hopefully somebody can help me with. for some reason the mouse pointer is grey when I choose "clearglass" under appearance settings on laptop A, but white when I choose "clearglass" on laptop B. How do I change the mouse pointer color to be white?
[01:54] <eugo> darkzero i dunno, try vlc media player
[01:54] <kibble> JensenDied: give this a shot http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Installing_Ubuntu_7.10_(Gutsy_Gibbon)_Tribe_on_a_ThinkPad_R61
[01:54] <numus> if i am in terminal on the live cd
[01:54] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: works fine here, windows stay where they are until I release Alt+Tab
[01:54] <numus> how do i go to my main ubuntu so i can change my xorg file
[01:54] <locellcount> anyone know how to get quicktime working on 64bit gutsy?
[01:54] <JensenDied> kibble: thanks for finding that
[01:54] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: since I can't reproduce the problem, I'm sorry...I can't really help :(
[01:54] <Flats> Anyone feel like taking a shot helping me figure out my intel wireless 3945ABG adapter? It shows in sudo lshw -C network but no drivers at all. Liek the software doesn't see it
[01:55] <aro> Fasma, I don't know if you can install applications on LiveCD, I've never tried sorry
[01:55] <dmandell> Megaqwerty:  Maybe I'm misunderstanding the way it's supposed to behave?
[01:55] <RobotBanana> Also, does anyone know what to do to stop the scroll pad on a laptop from switching between desktops? I can't find the setting... :|
[01:55] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: possibly, what do you expect it to do?
[01:55] <Dyus> numus: u just have to mount the drive with your ubuntu install
[01:55] <garu_> how do I install libdvdcss in gutsy?I'm trying to play a DVD, totem-xine is asking me that "r u trying to play a copy protected dvd whithout libdvdcss?"!lol
[01:55] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty:  My expectation is when I hit alt+tab everything goes dark and the switcher pops up (with three icons)
[01:55] <nibsa1242b> Mulder: on both my desktop and laptop fglrx install was seamless point & click
[01:55] <Fasma> aro, no problem thank you very much for your help, I restarted that rhythmbox app that's bundled with U and it now plays music
[01:55] <Lifeisfunny> How do I stop the way the windows open on the desktop?
[01:55] <bluebanana> numus: u on gutsy?
[01:55] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty: as I cycle through I don't want the windows popping up behind the switcher.
[01:55] <Dyus> then u can get to it with gedit or nautilus
[01:55] <diafic> sleep tiem nao. nini
[01:56] <packetgod> garu I actually recommend automatix but others say its bad news.  I think the new ersion works well
[01:56] <mrunagi> lol im having a hard time upgrading
[01:56] <JensenDied> kibble: well i just finised installing the compiz-kde package, seems to have had stuff not included in the base meta package i needed, still checking out the article though
[01:56] <Davy_Jones> if i install ubuntu gutsy on a new partition it would overwrite the grub of the previous ubuntu... right?
[01:56] <numus> bluebanana i screwed up my xorg.conf so i am trying to reload from a backup
[01:56] <bluebanana> Lifeisfunny: what do you mean?
[01:56] <nalioth> packetgod: join me in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[01:56] <m0n0set> what command to disconnect from vpn in terminall with client side?
[01:56] <bluebanana> numus: u on gutsy or on feisty?
[01:56] <m0n0set> openvpn
[01:56] <numus> bluebanana gutsy
[01:56] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: so...you want the windows to all disappear, or just not bring to front the one you currently have selected?
[01:56] <Lifeisfunny> bluebanana, the zoom effect is driving me batty
[01:56] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty: What I'm seeing is as I switch from one program to the next (while continuing to hold down alt) the program that I've select pops up in the background.
[01:56] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: and when I do... then my gnome is super slow suddenly.. windows update visibly, distortions and leftovers of windows after moved them.. and.. compiz refuse to work anyway with message..
[01:56] <VousDeux> locellcount: I think we are still waiting for medibuntu on that one
[01:56] <garu_> packetgod automatix?uuuuuhhhhh...i'v got a bad past with that app :o
[01:56] <bluebanana> i thought there was no reason to tinker with xorg.conf with gutsy
[01:56] <LjL> !automatix | packetgod, garu_
[01:56] <bluebanana> Lifeisfunny:  you want the regular effect?
[01:56] <ubotu> packetgod, garu_: Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.

[01:57] <DerDritte> Cleaning the cache didn't help firefox from freezing...
[01:57] <kibble> JensenDied: it lists a bunch of other stuff, but the part about the screen bug fixed is the section I was pointing at
[01:57] <Mulder> nibsa1242b, that's cool, but what about the interaction with compiz?
[01:57] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: then yes, you are describing what should happen when "Brint to Front" is unchecked
[01:57] <c0stner> anyone has experience with Xgl at ati Xpress 1150 on feisty ?
[01:57] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: and when I remove xserver-glx and restart.. it is fine again...
[01:57] <locellcount> VousDeux: Bugger, it's my last file format to get done...

[01:57] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty: either, or.  To me it's distracting to have the windows rotating in the background.
[01:57] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: and on my box, it does just that :-\
[01:57] <numus> bluebanana i have a pny verto fx 5500 video card.. and it wont let me run nvidia drivers.. keeps running veso
[01:57] <Lifeisfunny> bluebanana, is that the only other offered?
[01:57] <numus> err vesa
[01:57] <garu_> LjL it messes up the system
[01:57] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty:  Shoot.  What type of graphics card do you have?
[01:57] <oam_> this is the Nvidia driver version that is causing me problems ......  oam@oam-desktop:~$ cat /root/nvidia.version
[01:57] <oam_> NVRM version: NVIDIA UNIX x86 Kernel Module  100.14.19  Wed Sep 12 14:12:24 PDT 2007
[01:57] <oam_> GCC version:  gcc version 4.1.3 20070929 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.2-16ubuntu2)
[01:57] <kevinO> hello i just used gparted to create an extended partition on un allocated space, it still says unallocated, what do I do?
[01:57] <garu_> TheRepacker it messes up the system
[01:57] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: nVIDIA
[01:57] <VousDeux> locellcount: I'm not 100% certain though
[01:57] <Flats> Ok does anyone have an intel wireless 3945ASBG adapter that is working in Gutsy?
[01:57] <bluebanana> I ran the Distributoin upgrade. Now what? Must I reboot?
[01:57] <Tortured> im trying to connect to a samba share on another computer and i get a prompt for username/password and domain? i dont know what the domain is but ive tried a user on both machines' name and password and it never works?
[01:57] <bluebanana> Things look the same!
[01:57] <Flats> sorry ABG
[01:57] <garu_> my question is, why is that I can't install it in the terminal? :s
[01:57] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty:  Maybe it's an intel thing.
[01:57] <oam_> basicly if i load that driver i get a blank screen after X starts to load.
[01:58] <oam_> but if i use the "nv" driver , everything works fine .
[01:58] <redrumloa> Hello
[01:58] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty:  Ah well, thanks for looking into it for me.
[01:58] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: not all ati cards work well with xgl, but until we get the new ATI driver that is supposed to be coming out real soon now it is our only option.
[01:58] <oam_> any thoughts ???
[01:58] <Mulder> i cant wait til the new fglrx rolls out aiglx support
[01:58] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: it seems to me that the repository xserver-glx does not play well with fglrx prop ati driver..
[01:58] <Flats> Now I'm making up my own protocols
[01:58] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: possible, but unlikely, I'd ask in #compiz-fusion
[01:58] <kibble> bluebanana: if you're using gnome there will be a restart icon in your system tray, otherwise nope
[01:58] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty: Thanks for the advice, I will.
[01:58] <kevinO> hello i just used gparted to create an extended partition on un allocated space, it still says unallocated, what do I do?
[01:58] <dmandell>  Megaqwerty:  Thanks again and good night.
[01:58] <bluebanana> kibble: i' m using gnome, but there's no restart icon!!! am i in trouble?
[01:58] <Megaqwerty> dmandell: good luck
[01:58] <kibble> bluebanana: however you've probably upgraded your kernel so it couldn't hurt
[01:58] <bluebanana> see you all soon
[01:58] <redrumloa> Question: Is there known problems with Nvidia cards in Gutsy?
[01:58] <c0stner> everytime i start my Glx server my feisty is stuck
[01:58] <adriyel> CRAP
[01:58] <kibble> bluebanana: just because it's not there doesn't mean anything really
[01:59] <adriyel> is there an arabic ubuntu?
[01:59] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: or the other way around.. fglrx doesnt play well with xserver-glx :)
[01:59] <unstable> What software can I use to test my webcam? Something that comes with Gutsy by default?
[01:59] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: I see.. hmm
[01:59] <VousDeux> locellcount: have you tried libquicktime1?
[01:59] <mrunagi> whoa lag
[01:59] <Megaqwerty> redrumloa: I haven't experienced any. I'm not sure about the black window bug though...give me a sec to test that theory
[01:59] <kevinO> unstable, just search for webcam in synaptic
[01:59] <oam_> unstable : xsane should be able to display from the webcam i think
[01:59] <mrunagi> black window sounds like a compiz problem
[01:59] <c0stner> is my ati xpress 1150 not compatible with xserver glx
[01:59] <arjones85> i have an interesting issue hopefully somebody can help me with. for some reason the mouse pointer is grey when I choose "clearglass" under appearance settings on laptop A, but white when I choose "clearglass" on laptop B. How do I change the mouse pointer color to be white?
[01:59] <adriyel> arabic ubuntu?
[01:59] <kibble> unstable: any idea what kind it is? or if it's detected? is in internal to the machine or USB?
[01:59] <mrunagi> join #compiz-fusion and type !nv
[01:59] <adriyel> is there an arabic ubuntu channel?

[02:00] <adriyel> LjL channel?
[02:00] <unstable> kibble: It works with this luvcview software I got online
[02:00] <eythian> I need to fix a machine by mounting the drives from the live CD to do stuff - however, some of the partitions are on LVM. Anyone know how to make the live CD work with them?

[02:00] <robotphood> When I hit "QUIT" it takes about 45 seconds for the menu to appear. Anyone know how to fix this?
[02:00] <nibsa1242b> Mulder: I had to install xgl-server to get compiz to work after installing fglrx... but it worked fine and my laptop with an ATI 200M chipset runs most of the compiz effects quite nicely. It does cause about a 10 degree Celsius temp rise in the processor when I'm doing anything that requires Compiz so its probably not battery life efficient
[02:00] <adriyel> ahhhh, shanks!
[02:00] <Cryoniq> c0stner: I experience heavy problems when I install xserver-glx as well along with my ati9800pro..

[02:04] <kevinO> what does my video card have to do with gparted?
=== justin__ is now known as Jstn
[02:04] <garu_> Cryoniq that's odd...alot of people today got it working just by doing that :o!
[02:04] <joely_> anyone know about sound for a toshiba satellite a135?
[02:05] <Jstn> Is there a way to downgrade back to feisty?
[02:05] <Cryoniq> with the fglrx restricted installed now.. I get the composite extension is not available.. if I have glx installed and get major problems.. it says it doesnt have composite extension either.
[02:05] <hydrogen> kevinO: you need to create partitions in the extended partition if I recall correctly
[02:05] <ebirtaid> fn'kevinO: nothing
[02:05] <hydrogen> Jstn: no
[02:05] <garu_> joely_ no sound?or is it too low?
[02:05] <Arenlor> Cryoniq do you have xserver-xgl installed?
[02:05] <FLSimpsonKPT> how can i get Compiz Fusion working with an ATI Graphics card and Gutsy?
[02:05] <Cryoniq> garu_: if I try doing glrxinfo.. gnome blacks out on me and restart
[02:06] <garu_> Cryoniq humn...no idea why ur getting that prob :o
[02:06] <joely_> no sound at all.
[02:06] <VousDeux> I know gnome users don't like to look like windows, but I purposely dressed mine up to look as much like vista as possible because I am going to have to use it in a presentation and I don't want to have to deal with people saying they like the looks of vista better
[02:06] <kevinO> hydrogen so i create a logical partition in the extended? or should I just create a primary to begin with
[02:06] <Cryoniq> Arenlor: I had but it cripples the graphics at once and compiz wont start anyway telling me missing composite..
[02:06] <hydrogen> kevinO: you would create a logical partition in the extended.. .I think
[02:06] <Jstn> I'm having issues with gtk related software
[02:06] <hydrogen> I havn't used extended partitions in a while though
[02:06] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I recommend you try to get support for the open source driver as it used to work for you. At least if there is a bug in the open source driver, someone can fix it.
[02:06] <hydrogen> so you may want to get a second opinion
[02:06] <kevinO> can i just create a primary?
[02:07] <garu_> VousDeux there is no way people can like vista look better...
[02:07] <ckin2001> is this gutsy support now?
[02:07] <Kelley> Hey, can somebody help me with a quick question about cloning a drive please?
[02:07] <kevinO> yes ckin2001
[02:07] <VousDeux> garu_: get serious
[02:07] <garu_> VousDeux u dont even have to customise ubuntu that much...u can't even compare vista looks with Mac OS X
[02:07] <garu_> lol
=== racarter_ is now known as racarter
[02:07] <Arenlor> Cryoniq xserver-xgl I believe is required, it was for me, don't start an xgl session only start GNOME (the login window option)
[02:07] <garu_> VousDeux i am :o
[02:07] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: already tried that.. doesn't work either. as soon xserver-glx enters.. it is screwed
[02:07] <hydrogen> kevinO: you can only have a total of four partitions.. so if you have three or less now then you can create a primary
[02:07] <racarter> what is a good irc client for linux?
[02:08] <VousDeux> garu_: the vista look is very popular
[02:08] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: what is your question?
[02:08] <racarter> is xchat popular?
[02:08] <^^wizard^^> Question: Just installed 7.10 64 Bit in a Dual Boot with XP 32 Bit and a Fat 32 Partition. Two problems I can't enable my restricted drivers and firefoxes freeses my system ever time I load it. any suggestions?
[02:08] <kibble> racarter: xchat is popular
[02:08] <Kelley> I am trying to clone my Windows Partition into a Partition onto an External USB Hdd
[02:08] <ebirtaid> xchat sucks
[02:08] <zakman> is aiglx still used? and is it better then normal ubuntu + compiz ?

[02:08] <kevinO> hydrogen ahh i see thanks man
[02:08] <tux97> hi
[02:08] <knix> anyone have an nvidia 8800? All I get is a black screen
[02:08] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I don't know too much about the open drivers. I have an X800 and it isn't supported that well by them.
[02:08] <garu_> VousDeux lol...in my opinion, and I'm not alone on this one...its a cheap copy of mac os x...no offence for windows lovers :o!
[02:08] <tux97> anyone in here use hippo?

[02:08] <ubotu> irssi is a command line interface !IRC client. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Irssi for help
[02:08] <hydrogen> and mac os x is a cheap copy of gnome
[02:08] <hydrogen> SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
[02:08] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: question one, why are you cloning it?
[02:08] <atouk> !cifs
[02:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cifs - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[02:09] <Kelley> As a backup before I install Gutsy.
[02:09] <hydrogen> though it definatly comes up with some cool things
[02:09] <VousDeux> I use xchat, but I don't really spend much time on chat for the most part, so I just grabbed something to use while I get everything working on this new computer...then it will be back to business
[02:09] <tux97> hehe funny kevinO i was talking about the ipod software for ubuntu
[02:09] <joely_> i need sound on my a135 toshiba satellite for Gutsy... if anyone can help me it'd be much appreciated
[02:09] <underdog5004> not sure if I should ask here or not, but how do I make the "Application Bar" show applications from all desktops, not just the current one?
[02:09] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: might mention I ran beryl on feisty though.. with open source driver.. hmm.. never ran compiz on feisty
[02:09] <fant> My fresh install of 710 is missing the network applet on the gnome-panel ... can anyone help ?
[02:09] <garu_> VousDeux ubuntu's got great graphics!I just love everything about it...everyone who looks at my lappy goes crazy...including people who love vista
[02:09] <racarter> ok i just installed ubuntu 7.10 on my laptop.. but it is saying i do not have sound.. it says no volume control gstreamer plugins and/or devices found
[02:09] <secher> if i autoupdate my previous alpha of gutsy gibbon now, will it install the full release or will i have to reinstall??
[02:09] <Kelley> My plan was to boot into the live CD and copy and paste the contents of the Windows drive into the USB drive. Likewise, if something went wrong during installation, I would just re-copy and paste the contents of the USB drive into the Internal Drive.
[02:09] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: ok, just wanted to make sure you weren't going to try to boot from it. XP won't boot from a USB drive.
[02:09] <racarter> i know my soundcard works
[02:09] <flick> how can i delete a binding from compiz-fusion settings?
[02:10] <VousDeux> garu_: oh, hmmm...maybe I should have a look at mac os x...I didn't know they were similar

[02:10] <user934> ok.. im printing to cups-pdf
[02:10] <user934> It says the job is 3.5gb big?
[02:10] <user934> whats up with that?
[02:10] <MattJ> underdog5004: You can right-click on the taskbar, and choose preferences
[02:10] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: beryl which was originally a fork of compiz merged back into compiz so its basically the same now.
[02:10] <MattJ> underdog5004: There you can select "Show windows from all workspaces"
=== user934 is now known as neopsyche
[02:10] <neopsyche> ?
[02:11] <neopsyche> :(
[02:11] <Arenlor> flick "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager" then go into the settings manager and you can delete them via gui
[02:11] <garu_> VousDeux there is a video in youtube, with a guy being ironic saying that ms didnt copy mac os x!have a look at that, u'll change ur mind, I garantee you :)
[02:11] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: that won't actually clone it. You won't get boot sector info and such.
[02:11] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: yeah I thought it wouldnt be a problem regarding that ..
[02:11] <underdog5004> MattJ: I tried, but the only option I have is Properties, which goes to basic properties about the panel (height, color, etc..)
[02:11] <joely_> can you run something like the beryl manager with compiz?
[02:11] <Flats> Ok does anyone have an intel wireless 3945ABG adapter that is working in Gutsy?
[02:11] <secher> guys... if i autoupdate my previous alpha of gutsy gibbon now, will it install the full release or will i have to reinstall??
[02:11] <fant> My fresh install of 710 is missing the network applet on the gnome-panel ... can anyone help ?
[02:11] <dga> Arenlor: when i try that, i get "the composite extension is not available" when i click normal or extra. is there something else i have to install?
[02:11] <tux> Arenlor it saysThe composite extension is not available
[02:11] <kevinO> hydrogen should I use an ext2 or 3 fs?
[02:11] <Flats> •secher• the updates will make it the full
[02:11] <hydrogen> kevinO: ext3
[02:11] <minus> Hi ppl! I have an extra harddrive: /dev/sdb1 that I want to be automaticly mounted to "Computer" in gnome at startup. How/What do I do
[02:11] <secher> thanks flats
[02:11] <Arenlor> dga, tux, "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"
[02:11] <garu_> VousDeux i only use windows now, because I gotta do some work using visual studio 2005 .net!lol
[02:12] <kevinO> ok
[02:12] <kevinO> thanks
[02:12] <hydrogen> !automount | minus
[02:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about automount - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[02:12] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: it shouldn't be. It sounds like the open source driver, Gusty, and X aren't co-operating. And your best bet is to find someone who can help you figure out how to file that as a bug report.
[02:12] <hydrogen> bah
[02:12] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: I do have a set of recovery CDs that came with my Computer which returns the computer into the original partitions like it is set up now
[02:12] <MattJ> underdog5004: Is there any kind of something on the left of all your open window in the bar? I have a seperator, try right-clicking on that
[02:12] <tux> Arenlor does it matter that i have an ati graphics card?
[02:12] <racarter> why does it say "no volume control gstreamer plugins and/or devices found" when i try to change the volume?
[02:12] <racarter> on ubuntu 7.10
[02:12] <kibble> anyone using dell laptops and have problems?

[02:13] <underdog5004> MattJ: got it figured out, thank you!
[02:13] <numus> i am having a problem with nvidia restricted drivers.. i got nvidia-glx-new installed But it wont use the nvidia settings.. keeps using nv or vesa no matter how many times i tell it to change to nvidia
[02:13] <MattJ> underdog5004: No problem
[02:13] <Arenlor> tux go into System > Administration > Restricted Drivers Manager and turn on fglrx or whatever it is for your graphics card
[02:13] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: in that case you'd probably be ok, but I can't be certain since I don't use windows that much anymore. Are you afraid that the Ubuntu install with hose your windows install?
[02:13] <neopsyche> ??????????????/
[02:13] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: hmm wait a sec here now.. what exactly is the glx driver named.. is it xserver-xgl?
[02:13] <Kelley> Yeah, mainly
[02:13] <neopsyche> why does my print job say 3.5 gb?
[02:13] <Kelley> Just the partitioning
[02:13] <fant> My fresh install of 710 is missing the network applet on the gnome-panel ... can anyone help ?
[02:13] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: xserver-xgl is what I have to use because I use fglrx.
[02:13] <kibble> martman: ubuntu-desktop is just a package. there is no files in it really. it's a shell and doesn't really matter if it's install or not
[02:14] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: I have never had the partitioner screw up a drive before, but there is a first time for everything I supose
[02:14] <MattJ> fant: Try: Alt+F2, and type nm-applet, and press enter
[02:14] <kibble> neopsyche: that's going to take a lot of paper
[02:14] <kevinO> fant: look under gnome sessions and see if its enabled
[02:14] <neopsyche> trying to print to pdf
[02:14] <racarter> i need help with my sound card / drivers
[02:14] <neopsyche> why so huge?
[02:14] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: kk.. I think I said glx earlier.. just had a strange feeling when the it was xgl :)
[02:14] <garu_> Cryoniq did u actually did "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"?
[02:14] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: right now I dont even have a backup of the drive and so if the partition was wipped out, 80gb of music would be _gone_
[02:14] <fant> kevin0:  it is .. but the applet isnt running on the bar
[02:14] <tux> its already on Arenlor
[02:14] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: its wise to back up, just in case. Something could always happen... like a power outage right in the middle of partitioning.
[02:14] <fant> mattj:  nothing happens
[02:14] <martman> kibble its a virtual package that will install a crapload of stuff...i just want gnome
[02:15] <kevinO> fant: even better, add a network applet from the available applets
[02:15] <garu_> Cryoniq did u actually do!lol
[02:15] <Cryoniq> garu_: no I checked the box in synaptic and did it that way..
[02:15] <kibble> Kelley: pfft, only 80gb? buy a new drive :)
[02:15] <Arenlor> tux so you have fglrx installed and xserver-xgl installed?
[02:15] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: Yeah, definetly. Do you have any recomendations for creating a clone?
[02:15] <MattJ> fant: Type nm-applet in terminal, and see if it prints any errors
[02:15] <tux97> does anyone know how come rymbox wont play songs from a ipod?
[02:15] <kevinO> fant i dont know why its not there, i just started using the applet one
[02:15] <kevinO> its nicer
[02:15] <garu_> Cryoniq try doing that in the terminal!"sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"!
[02:15] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: Haha, right now the drive itself in thereis a 160gb
[02:15] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I'm known to be somewhat dyslexic so I may have glx as xgl when you said it. I'm sure I typed xgl though.
[02:15] <fant> mattj:  it moves to the next line, but doesnt do or start anything
[02:15] <tux> Arenlor: no I have the restricted drivers on (or is that it?)
[02:15] <hschroy> i just network upgraded to 7.10 on my VAIO - 7.04 was very stable, but now when the machine goes idle, it displays a login prompt upon 'waking' and then freezes up - the screen goes black and displays some messages about usb...
[02:15] <Fasma> newbie: can I open a new window on a new chat network without losing the window I'm on? how? TIA! :)
[02:15] <garu_> Cryoniq I think u need to enable ur restricted drivers and the system has to be up-to-date
[02:16] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: I typed it wrong.. a lot :)
[02:16] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: I tried clonezilla, but the interface stumped me and I was really scared I was going to screw things up big time
[02:16] <kibble> martman: yeah virtual package that's what I was trying to say, I know I always had lots of trouble with debian when i tried to force stuff in because they had stupid deps, I suppose it's possible
[02:16] <Fasma> sorry, I'm on xchat
[02:16] <Arenlor> tux please turn on your restricted drivers if there are any and "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"
[02:16] <kibble> martman: I usually just gave up and lived with it
[02:16] <Cryoniq> garu_: restricted are enabled right now and working green.. system is up to date also.. it is a clean install from beginning of gutsy also.. not an upgrade
[02:16] <martman> ouch
[02:17] <VousDeux> garu_: I see what you mean about the mac os x tiger...thanks for the enlightenment
[02:17] <MattJ> fant: Moves to the next line, and prints fant@blah-desktop:~$, or just blank on the new line?
[02:17] <fant> mattj :  blank
[02:17] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: I'm told that partimage will create a true clone. I tried it once and it didn't like me. It made the file fine, but yelled at me when I wanted to restore.
[02:17] <Cryoniq> garu_: could it be a problem the drivers are isntalled.. I mean maybe it goes wrong if installing fglrx before xserver-xgl, than other way around?
[02:17] <numus> please i am having a huge problem with nvidia can someone help me
[02:17] <garu_> Cryoniq then try that in the terminal, u wont lose anything.lol
[02:17] <MattJ> fant: Which would indicate that it is running... odd
[02:17] <Jaggs> OK I am real real new and was wondering if someone in here could help me out a little
[02:17] <garu_> VousDeux no problem :)!
[02:17] <fant> mattj:  i agree, but its not on my bar at all
[02:17] <Yowsers> does VMWare Server work on 7.10 yet?
[02:17] <Cryoniq> garu_: just my sanity.. been trying for 8 hours or so now.. probably 10 :D
[02:17] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: I'm looking at that now...
[02:17] <numus> anyone?
[02:18] <kibble> Jaggs: I'm sure someone can, try asking the problem
[02:18] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: I've personally had the best luck with dd but your millage may vary.

[02:18] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: How would I use dd?
[02:18] <tux> Arenlor: okay I did that. now what
[02:18] <Cryoniq> garu_: btw.. why does my gnome die right off if I do fglrxinfo?
[02:18] <joely_> can anyone help me with my sound? I just upgraded to Gusty and its completely not working. Toshiba Satellite a135 series. it has a realtek chip
[02:18] <cesar_> well my lunix is officially broken. gutsy destroyed my computer
[02:18] <kibble> Kelley: dd if=/dev/hda of=file.iso
[02:18] <JensenDied> kibble: bah, garbage. they really need to stop changing defaults every release. im  gonna deal with apache2.2 crud first
[02:18] <cesar_> can i boot off a live cd and access my hard drives to do a backup?
[02:18] <silent_> joely_, try reinstalling alsa-utils
[02:18] <Jaggs> OK I can not for the life of me get Ubuntu to recognise my wireless
[02:18] <garu_> Cryoniq no idea! :o
[02:18] <Burlynn> grr do i need to like add a user to samba to login after i add a folder to shared folders via samba? i cant even log in on the same damn machine ;/
[02:18] <kibble> Kelley: wasn't really playing attention to your conversation, that's how dd is used
[02:19] <silent_> joely_, try reinstalling alsa-base as well

[02:19] <joely_> sudo apt-get those?
[02:19] <element> hi
=== _a|K|a is now known as a[K]a
[02:19] <Arenlor> tux now try going into System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects and seeing if you can turn it on
[02:19] <silent_> joely_, you can always compile the latest alsa drivers from the site
[02:19] <Cryoniq> garu_: if I try aticonfig it will coredump and have xorg.conf dissapear as well.. funny problems here :)
[02:19] <joely_> ahh okay
[02:19] <element> when i turn on my Compiz effects
[02:19] <joely_> thanks
[02:19] <dga> Arenlor: how do i configure compiz now?
[02:19] <garu_> Cryoniq if ur having that much problems with ur gnome, u can always try reinstalling it :o
[02:19] <element> my titlebar dissapears
[02:19] <kibble> JensenDied: I've been upgrading to 7.10 since tribe1, haven't really had too much trouble yet
[02:19] <silent_> joely_, i believe the latest is 1.15rc3
[02:19] <garu_> Cryoniq funny indeed :o!:)
[02:19] <joely_> i'll try that
[02:19] <Cryoniq> garu_: hmm yeah.. this one is installed from the desktop iso..
[02:19] <Kelley> kibble: Ok, thanks. Does that copy all of the empty blocks though? I want to copy the 90gb of data onto a 92gb partition, but the source drive itself is 155gb
[02:20] <tux> Arenlor: still doesn't work
[02:20] <silent_> joely_, if you need help compiling just ask
[02:20] <Cryoniq> garu_: I heard there is an alternate iso also.. what is different between them?
[02:20] <tux> Arenlor: its giving me the same error
[02:20] <dga> Arenlor: compizconfig-settings-manager?
[02:20] <garu_> be right back...I'll do a restart to see if now I can play dvd's :)
[02:20] <joely_> okay thanks silent_
[02:20] <mmdski> is it possible to run 32bit ubuntu on a 64bit processor?
[02:20] <PriceChild> mmdski, yes
[02:20] <silent_> mmdski, yes
[02:20] <kibble> Kelley: it will yes, it will raw copy everything, not files, just the whole file system, since you don't know where it ends I don't think dd would be a good choice
[02:20] <edubuntu> is your wirless wep protected  Jaggs?
[02:20] <mmdski> sweet
[02:20] <element> when i turn on compiz effects, my titlebar dissapears
[02:20] <clarkey> Just a question in Gusty my wireless button on my laptop stopped working, it was in feisty but I have found a command to turn on the wireless only problem is that I have to run it every time I start the laptop is there a file I can put it to run automatically at startup? the command is         echo "1" > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled
[02:20] <xIke_> anyone have any luck getting enemy territories: quake wars to work in ubuntu with radeon x1600?
[02:20] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: kibble gave a decent example... I prefer to pipe it to gzip or bzip so it zips up while its running... it works, but its slow. It makes a byte for byte copy of everything including freespace. Partimage is basically a gui interface to special uses of dd, but like I said I had issues with it... that was over a year ago though
[02:20] <Arenlor> dga did you install that? if so go to System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects and choose custom
[02:20] <Jaggs> I dont think so
[02:20] <mmdski> do i have to do anything special?
[02:20] <scrottles> hyi
[02:20] <f|shy> yes, so long as it isnt an itanium......
[02:20] <JensenDied> kibble: any idea where they threw the compiz config stuff?
[02:20] <element> anyone know how to fix it?
[02:21] <silent_> mmdski, 64 bit cpus are backward compatible... you can run any 32 bit OS on a 64 bit processor
[02:21] <scrottles> how does one un-ignore a repo?
[02:21] <scrottles> Ign http://security.ubuntu.com feisty-security/restricted Translation-en_US
[02:21] <Cryoniq> what is difference between desktop iso and alternate iso?
[02:21] <scrottles> for example
[02:21] <edubuntu> What kind of card is it
[02:21] <Arenlor> tux what visual drivers are installed by the Restricted Drivers Manager?
[02:21] <silent_> mmdski, with the right utilities you can also run 32 bit programs on a 64 bit os
[02:21] <scrottles> that line came from apt-get update
[02:21] <Lifeisfunny> I get stuff like compiz with no way to modify the settings ........ I would like to go back to compiz where I have some control over it.
[02:21] <kibble> JensenDied: gnome-compiz-manager or something, it's been pasted a few times
[02:21] <Jaggs> dell 1390 ... I think
[02:21] <silent_> Lifeisfunny, the options are in appearance
[02:21] <mmdski> silent_, what utilities would these be?
[02:21] <Arenlor> compizconfig-settings-manager kibble, JensenDied
[02:21] <kibble> Jaggs: wireless card? broadcom, it's pretty well suppored
[02:21] <tux> Arenlor: ATI accelerated graphics driver
[02:21] <kibble> yeah what he said
[02:22] <JensenDied> kibble: alright, one would think compiz-manager-gnome since thats the package name
[02:22] <element> when i turn on compiz effects, my titlebar dissapears anyone know how to fix it?
[02:22] <Jaggs> the kind that they put in this POS computer :)
[02:22] <Kelley> kibble and nibsa1242b: Hmm... Well I guess I should do a dd copy but how could I copy directly from the internal partition to the external USB drive?
[02:22] <Lifeisfunny> silent, there are no options to keep it from zooming
[02:22] <kibble> JensenDied: hence I said or something
[02:22] <Dumptruck> gstgnomevfssrc.c(861): gst_gnome_vfs_src_start (): /play/source:
[02:22] <Dumptruck> Could not open vfs file "http://localhost:8900/" for reading: Service not available (38)
[02:22] <Fasma> well, sorry, Ubuntu is fine but not yet ready for prime time, I was a tech-geek years ago but by now I would expect anyone and everyone to put usability in a higher priority than anything ese
[02:22] <silent_> mmdski, can't remember the name of the package. It's needed to run flash/java for 64 bit... but if you're new to ubuntu, I'd strongly recommend you install 32
[02:22] <Fasma> else
[02:22] <dga> Jaggs: i have the same card
[02:22] <Dumptruck> what does this mean?
[02:22] <JensenDied> wait, neither are there...
[02:22] <Jaggs> Im starting to wonder if it is getting the card but not the signal from the router
[02:22] <Kelley> Partimage does look easier though...
[02:22] <Arenlor> tux run this in a terminal "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" just to make sure
[02:22] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b:   what is difference between desktop iso and alternate iso?
[02:22] <Fasma> so, back to that dreary Windows
[02:22] <kibble> Kelley: yeah dd is really not the right way to go with this one, I would use cp -Ra from-directory to-directory
[02:22] <mmdski> i'll have to do everything over again...
[02:23] <silent_> nibsa1242b, desktop boots a live version, alternate only installs
[02:23] <mmdski> thanks
[02:23] <kibble> Cryoniq: alt doesn't have a gui install
[02:23] <edubuntu> Ok is it a dell wiht a broadcom 1390?
[02:23] <silent_> nibsa1242b, alternate offers more installation options
[02:23] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: I would just try to use partimage if I were you
[02:23] <Lifeisfunny> I would like to have it simply fade when opening and have everything open in the center not 'inteligently' as if I need everything to open in a corner
[02:23] <Cryoniq> kibble: ah.. thanks
[02:23] <Jaggs> no its HP
[02:23] <element> when i turn on compiz effects, my titlebar dissapears anyone know how to fix it?
[02:23] <kibble> edubuntu: 1390 is a dell wifi card
[02:23] <silent_> edubuntu, I'm talking to you on the 1390
[02:23] <adriyel> the miniLAN Broadcom cards ARE EVIL
[02:23] <edubuntu> manufactured by broadcom? right
[02:23] <adriyel> EVIL I  SAY!
[02:23] <silent_> edubuntu, you need help getting it set up?
[02:24] <kibble> element it's pretty common, and easy to fix, but I can't recall any urls of the top of my brain
[02:24] <edubuntu> I have a air force one a BCM4318
[02:24] <Cidan> Does anyone know of a way to see joysticks and calibrate them in 7.10?
[02:24] <clarkey>  Just a question in Gusty my wireless button on my laptop stopped working, it was in feisty but I have found a command to turn on the wireless only problem is that I have to run it every time I start the laptop is there a file I can put it to run automatically at startup? the command is         echo "1" > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled
[02:24] <edubuntu> Nope jaggs
[02:24] <Arenlor> adriyel you using gutsy?
[02:24] <element> if you remember pm me or write it here or whatver
[02:24] <silent_> Jaggs, you need help setting up your 1390?
[02:24] <Epico> i installed gusty finally, but there is no compiz-fusion :[
[02:24] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: alternate allows more options, doesn't give you a live cd to work from, you can upgrade from the alternate, and the alternate runs better on slower machines
[02:24] <Jaggs> iyes I do
[02:24] <element> i just want it fixed
[02:24] <JensenDied> Arenlor: well ive installed compizconfig-settings-manager (not added by default for some reason) and compiz-kde and there isnt file to run in sight =/
[02:24] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: ah
[02:24] <minus> I want ubuntu to automatically mount my 500GB ntfs disk and my 320GB EXT3 disk and show them in "Computer". Can someone tell me?
[02:24] <CarlF1> installed gutsy, installed wine, ran regedit, error: X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)
[02:25] <tux> Arenlor: okay now what?
[02:25] <element> epico, its there somewhrere lol
[02:25] <silent_> Jaggs, I'm running one right now so I can help you get it running in about 5 minutes, want to join another channel so its easier to talk?
[02:25] <unstable> I can use this program "luvcview" I got from http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/, and I can see myself on my webcam fine. But when I try to use xsane, or ekiga..it doesn't work.
[02:25] <Cidan> For those of you using ATI, install xgl-server and compiz
[02:25] <Jaggs> yes please
[02:25] <nibsa1242b> edubuntu: the BCM4318 is one of the cards that doesn't always work... esp if its rev 02
[02:25] <Cidan> and Ubuntu will take care of the rest
[02:25] <silent_> Jaggs, join #1390
[02:25] <Cidan> no sessions to setup
[02:25] <dga> how do i configure compiz so i have the cube? when i enable desktop cube and rotate cube, my 4 workspaces are reduced to two workspaces and i'm left with a 2d thin thing with a desktop on both sides.
[02:25] <Epico> element, how do i enable it?
[02:25] <Kelley> kibble and nibsa1242b: The command line way of doing it seems abit to complicated for me, so Partimage is looking like the way to go. I found a guide for using it with the Live CD so I think I will just do that. One question though: Will I be able to read the individual contents of that image in the case of the restore failing?
[02:25] <fepoo> if i do a straight ubuntu install instead of an update and don't format the partition, will it still kill everything in my home dir?
[02:25] <edubuntu> Which mine is
[02:25] <edubuntu> Its working fine
[02:25] <element> epico: I'll give you the link in a sec
[02:25] <unstable> "Error while opening video device USB2.0 Camera", is what Ekiga tells me
[02:25] <Jaggs> umm how do I do that>
[02:25] <Arenlor> tux now see if it runs again
[02:25] <Epico> element, thanks :]
[02:25] <Cidan> Does anyone know of a way to see joysticks and calibrate them in 7.10?
[02:25] <edubuntu> I just downloaded the windows drivers and aimd ndiswraooer at them
[02:25] <Lifeisfunny> this is currently obnoxious
[02:25] <testify> I'm having an issue with my Dlink DWL AG530 wireless network card. I can connect to my wireless network properly when I am in roaming mode, but when I change the IP address to static, it won't connect.
[02:25] <^^wizard^^> So is firefoix stable on 64-bit systems? or have there been a lot of bugs?
[02:26] <element> epico: http://www.arsgeek.com/?p=2754
[02:26] <tux> arenlor: nope
[02:26] <Cidan> ^^wizard^^: No issues here

[02:26] <silent_> Jaggs, "/join #1390"
[02:26] <fant> anyone know why nm-applet will not start ?
[02:26] <Burlynn> grr do i need to like add a user to samba to login after i add a folder to shared folders via samba? i cant even log in on the same damn machine ;/
[02:26] <kibble> Kelley: never used partimage, but if it uses dd linux thinks it's a drive, even if it's just a file. so yes
[02:26] <Arenlor> JensenDied run ccsm in a terminal
[02:26] <unstable> I think ubuntu is set to use v4l by default, that is the kernel module right? But it needs to use the uvc kernel module.
[02:26] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: I think so. I think you can mount it as a loopback device. However, you might not be able to do that if you choose to compress the file. (<- unsure about this last point)
[02:26] <Jaggs> silent tel me how and I will
[02:26] <jburd> ^^wizard^^: Firefox is running smoothly on all my 64-bit systems.
[02:26] <Arenlor> tux, this is really strange, did you upgrade or do a clean install?

[02:26] <adriyel> Arenlor: what?
[02:26] <silent_> Jaggs, I did
[02:26] <kibble> fant: did you run it from command line? does it produce an error?
[02:26] <silent_> Jaggs, "/join #1390"
[02:26] <fepoo> anyone?  if i do a straight install without formatting my partitions, will ubuntu still kill everything in my home dir?
[02:26] <dystopianray> damn it, I can't hibernate anymore with gutsy and suspend is so flakey
[02:26] <mark_> fant: do you get any feedback when you try it on the command line?
[02:26] <edubuntu> Seems everyone is talking about nic's now
[02:26] <tux> clean install Arenlor
[02:26] <fant> kibble:  produces no errors .. acts like it starts but nothing happens
[02:27] <Jaggs> "/join #1390
[02:27] <nibsa1242b> kibble: Kelley: as far as I know partimage uses dd, cuts out all the empty space, and allows for compression
[02:27] <Kelley> kibble and nibsa1242b: Ok, I don't have any need to compress it, so I guess it should work then. I will try and read the image though and make sure it works before partitioning
[02:27] <kibble> fant: did you install network-manager?
[02:27] <silent_> Jaggs, without the quote
[02:27] <^^wizard^^> ok, then I'd imagine its either a hardware/driver issue on my end or some problem with instalation getting a lot of lockups and freezes
[02:27] <Arenlor> adriyel you said about miniLAN being evil? gutsy comes with native drivers that completely suck for it, but they do work
[02:27] <mark_> fepoo: I think in the partitioner, you can tell which partitions you format.
[02:27] <alphae> turkish  help?
[02:27] <Jaggs> sorry
[02:27] <fant> kibble:  its already installed
[02:27] <tux> Arenlor: I have an ATI Radeon X1300
=== DM is now known as Delvien
[02:27] <kibble> ^^wizard^^: what type of machine?
[02:27] <fepoo> mark_: but if i don't format, will it kill everything in my home dir anyway?
[02:27] <Jaggs> So Sorry about that I didnt realise I had the quote in there
[02:27] <tux> Arenlor: Could that be part of the problem?
[02:27] <kibble> fant: did it include the gnome part to?
[02:27] <fepoo> or will it just update over what packages are there
[02:27] <Arenlor> tux I have an ATI Radeon too, so not likely
[02:27] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: just remember that if you do need to mount the image, do it read only.
[02:27] <mark_> feboo: I think only formatting kills it.
[02:27] <fepoo> k good
[02:27] <fant> kibble: sure did
[02:28] <Jaggs> I said I was real new... But I will love you forever.

[02:29] <warbler> mark_: during install you have to tell the  partitioner to mount the existing /home as /home
[02:29] <kibble> edubuntu: it's the driver, mine does that to
[02:29] <Arenlor> adriyel because anything < gutsy you have to find and install it separately which is even worse

[02:31] <eugo> when im copying files, some files have messed up filenames due to special chars
[02:31] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: because its a byte for byte backup, and you want to pull a file out of it you don't want things like access times recorded and such. However, I don't think partimage is really meant to be used in that manner. (to pull out individual files)
[02:31] <kibble> racarter: laptop or desktop?

[02:35] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I believe that there is an issue with AGP, the fglrx driver, and any 2.6.x kernel. You need additional drivers for your mobo for it to work.
[02:35] <unstable>  minus You don't need the uuid, just put /dev/blah1 instead
[02:35] <mark_> org:  Yes.
[02:35] <wirechief> ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
[02:35] <tux97> correct xIke
[02:35] <K3nt> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions this only shows for older versions of ubuntu
[02:35] <xIke_> Fasma, agreed.  I think they should open a few more channels and recommend that users go there.  at least divide up the chaos
[02:35] <mark_> kibble: ha.
[02:35] <org> mark_, accept it
[02:35] <minus> unstable, the fstab is better with UUID instead of /dev/ path
[02:35] <xIke_> tux97, hold on, I'll try it with my ipod
[02:35] <warbler> is there a terminal command for the screensaver? The GUI just ignores all my selections!
[02:35] <Fasma> xIke_ yes, usability is not a concept of priority in the Linux community
[02:36] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I'm not too familiar with running ati cards with fglrx over agp... all my comps are pcie.
[02:36] <tux97> ok thanks
[02:36] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: hmm but it use agp without the xserver-xgl and works fine.. hmm
[02:36] <Arenlor> tux it's xorg-driver-fglrx and xserver-xorg-video-at now apparently
[02:36] <wirechief> minus ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid
[02:36] <kibble> minus: and it's impossible to edit by hand
[02:36] <unstable> minus: better how?
[02:36] <unstable> it's the same thing
[02:36] <robert_> is there anything wrong with "echo 's@66.219.172.87@pl.envisionrx.com@g' > /tmp/sedscr | find . -type f | xargs runsed -f /tmp/sedscr" ?
[02:36] <nibsa1242b> Kelley loopback is the ability to mount a file as a drive.
[02:36] <kibble> damn, have to plug machine in
[02:36] <org> mark_, http://pastebin.com/m278262ca
[02:36] <neosix> I have agp ati and it's work fine
[02:36] <mark_> org: Looks like I need to register my nick. one minute.
[02:36] <org> mark, why you don't accept dcc send.
[02:36] <neosix> :)
[02:36] <tux> Arenlor: so what do i need to do now?
[02:36] <minus> wirechief, The drive isn't there... so thats not the way...
[02:36] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: Oh, ok. That makes sense
[02:37] <mark_> org: That shows ext3 for sda1. Tha'ts good.
[02:37] <org> mark_, is my partitions are OK you think? I'm pretty new and the only thing that confuse me right now, is partitioning good:)
[02:37] <minus> unstable, If I move the connectors to the drives inside my computer, the right drive will be mounted on the same spot anyhow, cause it goes after the UUID and not /dev/ path..
=== mark_ is now known as markstos
[02:37] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: Alright, well I guess I am going to try PartImage then. It looks like it should work for what I want it to do.
[02:37] <darkphader> no eth0 in gutsy on t20 fresh install, edgy was fine, the gutsy alt install cd started networking fine
[02:37] <org> mark_, please accept my dcc send, I beg you.
[02:38] <Negra> what is gobuntu?
[02:38] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: basically when you loop mount something as a loop device it allows you to see it as a drive. Think of it as a "virtual drive" as you will. You want to mount it ro (read only) since you wouldn't want to change any of the files in the image.
[02:38] <IcemanV9> !gobuntu | Negra
[02:38] <ubotu> Negra: gobuntu is a freedom-focused flavour of Ubuntu. See http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/130 for more.
[02:38] <etank> if my system will run from the live cd then i can assume that it will run after a full install right?
[02:38] <random> I am downloading 7.10 right now, would compiz be enabled by default?
=== markstos is now known as mark_
[02:38] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: PartImage should def work. and good luck with your install
[02:38] <Arenlor> if you "sudo apt-get install --reinstall compiz xserver-xgl xorg-driver-fglrx xserver-xorg-video-ati" it should reinstall them for you afterwords you should be able to use it
[02:38] <Kelley> nibsa1242b and kibble: Thanks so much for your help. One last question though, when Ubuntu is installed, how do I tell Grub to load windows by default?
[02:38] <secher> do i have wrong drivers, or is can i just not run Desktop effects on a laptop with Intel x3100 graphics? Its wierd because i have used it before..
[02:38] <mark_> org: I can't. My nick isn't registered.
[02:38] <org> mark_, Ok one second
[02:38] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: hmm then this line shows up further down.. (EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable.. aiglx shouldn't be in this.. aiglx is used under kde if I understood it right?
[02:38] <mark_> org: and I can't remember my password.
[02:38] <org> i'll upload somewhere
[02:38] <xIke_> bad news tux97: it works fine for me
[02:39] <random> \nick santa
[02:39] <Kelley> This is my Dad's computer, and I am installing Ubuntu for him to try out, but he still mainly want to use Windows.
[02:39] <tux97> :((
[02:39] <tux> Arenlor: so what do i need to do now?
[02:39] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: I think it auto configures grub for your windows install, but I'm not sure.
[02:39] <Arenlor> tux did you do that line that I told you?
[02:39] <xIke_> tux97, you using USB 2 I assume?
[02:39] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: AIGLX is used with Nvidia and the free drivers. Its not used with fglrx.
[02:39] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: That works. In the event that it doesn't, how would I change it?
[02:39] <unstable> Do I need to get a special xsane to use v4l2, instead of v4l? Or does the default xsane that comes with Gutsy work with v4l2, and if it works..how?
[02:39] <etank> Kelley: it will auto config but it will set ubuntu as default
[02:39] <tux97> i'm tryin to like linux alot and get rid of my dual boot with winbloze lol
[02:39] <coz_> no takers on the wacom issue?
[02:39] <tux> oh now i see it sorry Arenlor
[02:39] <Jaszbo> Hi room. I am having [problems installing Gutsy-it hangs at 85%. Is this common and is there a work arounf? I am using the alt install cd
[02:39] <IcemanV9> Kelley: it'll add windows to the grub automatically
[02:39] <tux97> how do i know if i'm using usb 2 with gutsy
[02:39] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: ah hmm..
[02:40] <etank> Kelley: i think you have to modify the grub.conf
[02:40] <Kelley> etank: How would I do that?
[02:40] <martyvis> any idea how to get system beep sounding in feisty. visual beep works when i hit Ctrl-G in a console - but no sound. sound is on and working in general
[02:40] <secher> do i have wrong drivers, or is can i just not run Desktop effects on a laptop with Intel x3100 graphics? Its wierd because i have used it before..
[02:40] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: worst case, you'd boot up with the live cd and edit GRUBs config. Other wise, it might just boot you into Ubuntu and then you'd have to setup GRUB to recongize your windows partition as bootable from there. Its not that difficult to do.
[02:41] <xIke_> tux97, so when you plug your ipod in, does rhythmbox automatically openup?
[02:41] <coz_> !blacklist
[02:41] <ubotu> To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add « blacklist <modulename> » to the end of that list - To explicitly load modules in a specific order, list them in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and type « sudo update-initramfs -u »
[02:41] <tux97> yes
[02:41] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: another thing I been thinking off is.. before I installed gutsy on this Intel bonanza intel cpu box etc.. I disabpled plug'n'play OS in bios.. think I heard one should do that.. can that have something to do with the agp error?
[02:41] <org> mark_, here check please. http://shell.lomag.net/~org/Screenshot.png
[02:41] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: but I'm like 90% sure that it should just work
[02:41] <tux97> i think hold on let me retry it
[02:41] <etank> Kelley: i think that it is in the /boot dir
[02:41] <tux> Arenlor: ok it did that. now what?
[02:41] <kevleviathan> Does anybody know how to disable the internal PC speaker? Mine beeps when I hit, for example, backspace when there's no more characters to delete such as in pidgin
[02:41] <Arenlor> tux try turning it on now
[02:42] <Kelley> nibsa1242b and etank: Ok, thanks alot. I'll do some more research on grub, but all of you have been extreemely helpful
[02:42] <tux> Arenlor: no luck :(
[02:42] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I don't know, I haven't had a computer with in years. I have plug & play turned on in my bios.
[02:42] <tux> dammit i wanna use Compiz Fusion!
[02:42] <eugo> What is the quickest way to get a FTP server up in Ubuntu?
[02:42] <smmagic> kevleviathan: Mute it?
[02:42] <kevleviathan> I can't find it in the sound mixer
[02:42] <Arenlor> tux I am not sure what's wrong with it

[02:42] <tux> brb
[02:42] <etank> anyone know why my system will run from the live cd but will not get to a desktop after an actual install?
[02:42] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: ah hmm.. going to fiddle some more and enable it again.. thanks for answering all my questions :) Very helpful :)

[02:43] <funkyb> can anyone direct me to the correct channel for asking a compiz + conky question?  (who says dudes can't ask for directions...lol)
[02:43] <ThePub> What's needed to enable "screen2" to get xinerama back up and running under 7.10?
[02:43] <tux97> it works automaticly rb opens up when i plug it in i have mp3s on it
[02:43] <misnix> kevleviathan, system, prefs,sound,system beep
[02:43] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: at the least the install will should allow you to boot into Ubuntu. If Grub doesn't have a windows option in the menu its not that difficult to add one. Grub is great. I love being able to have a custom image at boot (I have one of my dogs).
[02:43] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: np, hope you get it figured out
[02:43] <kevleviathan> awesome! thanks so much misnix
[02:43] <XXer> Could someone give me a hand with this ...This the my first attempt at install a game in linux without the using the (add/remove app). First off im trying to install scourge, It gives me 5 steps to install it which are (1. tar -xzvf scourge-XX.tar.gz
[02:43] <XXer> 2. cd scourge-XX
[02:43] <XXer> 3. ./configure
[02:43] <XXer> 4. make
[02:43] <XXer> 5. ./src/scourge). Iv done No. 1&2 but now I dont know what No.3  means
[02:43] <tux97> it shows a red cricle with a white line through it
[02:43] <Pelo> ThePub,  I suggest you handle it as if you never had two screens before
[02:43] <kevleviathan> Now problem number 2 is that I can't get my Broadcom wireless to work, anybody have experience setting that up in Gutsy?
[02:44] <org> mark_, hi.
[02:44] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: yeah.. otherwize I have a Nvidia GeForce 6200 Turbo Edition in my other box.
[02:44] <tux97> how do i install a decoder?
[02:44] <clarkey>  Just a question in Gusty my wireless button on my laptop stopped working, it was in feisty but I have found a command to turn on the wireless only problem is that I have to run it every time I start the laptop is there a file I can put it to run automatically at startup? the command is         echo "1" > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled
[02:44] <Arenlor> XXer when you've cd'd there type ./configure
[02:44] <ThePub> Pelo: that's not really helpful, especially if you're saying give up on dual monitors.
[02:44] <nibsa1242b> kevleviathan: which Broadcom card
[02:44] <etank> kevleviathan: i think you need ndiswrapper for that
[02:44] <XXer> that didnt work
[02:44] <mark_> org: ?
[02:44] <Negra> my AWN and deatop settings manager is not working
[02:44] <org> mark_, http://shell.lomag.net/~org/Screenshot.png
[02:44] <etank> kevleviathan: or something called fwcutter (i think that is it)
[02:44] <funkyb> ndiswrapper worked for me
[02:44] <Pelo> XXer,   first you need to install build essential   sudo apt-get install build-essential
[02:44] <tux97> mp3
[02:44] <Cryoniq> err TurboForce edition.. ^^
[02:45] <kevleviathan> etank: i've tried installing that (successfully), and I go into restricted drivers and it enables the firmware properly
[02:45] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: Haha, ok. One last question actually. Right now, when the computer boots up into the Windows partition after the bios, I see a little menu that has two options. One for Windows XP and the other for Windows XP recovery console or something like that. Is that on the Master Boot Record? Will that get screwed up at all? I know the recovery console does not have its own partition
[02:45] <icon> I'm getting this error when trying to run restricted-manager: http://pastebin.ca/743065
[02:45] <kevleviathan> however, once I reboot, it stops working
[02:45] <Pelo> !mp3 | tux97

[02:45] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: my understanding is that support for Nvidia cards is much better then ATI currently. However, there is supposed to be an official open ATI driver coming out soon.
[02:45] <element> wow lol
[02:45] <element> compiz sucks
[02:45] <martyvis> XXer: you may need to run autogen.sh first - read the INSTALL file (or README) for instructions
[02:45] <Arenlor> element in what way?
[02:45] <element> titlebar dissapeared
[02:45] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: I experience it like that also. Yeah.. I heard there is one on the way.. :)
[02:45] <element> and terminal is just a white screen
[02:45] <coz_> element, nvidia card?
[02:45] <element> yeah
[02:45] <Pelo> element, candy rots your teeth, eye candy does it to your brain
[02:46] <kevleviathan> Weird thing is that as soon as I enable the firmware, the light turns on (the hardware LED) but shortly after turns off. The card shows up in network properties until I reboot, where it goes away
[02:46] <coz_> element, did you do nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24
[02:46] <Arenlor> Pelo, my college is bad for students if that's true
[02:46] <Pelo> element,  that's just a decorator issue ask in #ubuntu-effect and they will tell you how to fix it
[02:46] <funkyb> ok - I use conky and compiz in gusty.  When I load conky from terminal everything is great.  When conky loads on startup, compiz puts shadows on the conky window and the window is not 'underneith' all other windows, like it is when I run from terminal (after killing the startup instance)
[02:46] <element> yeah
[02:46]  * Cryoniq heads over to the bios.. maybe brb
[02:46] <IcemanV9> Pelo: ha. well put. :)
[02:46] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: I don't know. It doesn't sound like an mbr thing to me. It sounds like a windows thing, and should probably be fine.
[02:46] <XXer> Ok thanks Ill give thoes a try THanks
[02:46] <coz_> element, and  which nvidia card and driver are you using
[02:46] <tux> Arenlor: its kind of working now. I wan't compiz fusion now :D
[02:46] <Kelley> nibsa1242b: Ok, thanks alot
[02:46] <tux> Arenlor: there are no fancy effects but its running on extra right now
[02:46] <element> sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
[02:46] <nibsa1242b> Kelley: np
[02:46] <Kelley> I'm off to actually do all of this...thanks and bye all.
[02:47] <coz_> element, more importantly how are you starting compiz fusion
[02:47] <payan> i'm having problems with network manager

[02:53] <org> I just installed Gutsy and i would like a tutorials that tells me few useful packages that I do really need to install as a start :)
[02:53] <mEck0_> coz_, *testing*
[02:53] <element> Sevk: hi
[02:53] <funkyb> nibsal242b - i think what you want is samba
[02:53] <funkyb> i made it work pretty easy on my lan
[02:53] <Blama[STOLZEN]> mark_, funkyb, I get it everytime I log on to Ubuntu and it doesn't seem to do anything but annoy me but I am unable to open the Device Manager and I think it is because of this problem.
[02:53] <jdong> coz_: I see xorg.conf entries for them... don't know much else
[02:53] <Arenlor> tux are you sure? it is all one word like that, because if it's installed you'll see System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
[02:53] <coz_> element,  ok what were we talking about
[02:53] <bluebanana> i want to install freshly ubuntu 7.10. Should i get main iso or alternate-install iso? Please support your answer. Thank you.
[02:54] <payan> mark_:Thanks, i always forget it :s
[02:54] <aro> bluebanana, how much ram do you have
[02:54] <coz_> jdong, ok thanks
[02:54] <element> title bar disappears during compiz effects
[02:54] <brooklynhype> can someone help me install the flash plugin on firefox, i get this mesage when i try to do it ''can not find 'flashplugin-nonfree''
[02:54] <bluebanana> aro: how can i check?
[02:54] <aro> bluebanana, alternate is mainly for older computers
[02:54] <K3nt> in the OS selector( im dual booting) i cant see vista at all. I was hoping to mount the vista partition to make sure it works. the guide for mounting the partition o the faq is outdated. any help?
[02:54] <aro> bluebanana, are you on live cd?
[02:54] <bluebanana> i'm on no cd yet
[02:54] <tux> Arenlor: I don't see it. CompizConfig Settings Manager doesn't load
[02:54] <aro> bluebanana, in windows?
[02:54] <bluebanana> aro, how can i find out how much ram i have?
[02:54] <org> I just installed Gutsy and i would like a tutorials that tells me few useful packages that I do really need to install as a start :)
[02:54] <funkyb> Blama, I am surprised to hear you can boot a machine complaining of problems with HAL.  Sorry I am not of more help
[02:54] <coz_> element, ok    in terminal after you have done   metacity --replace   then do   compiz --replace ccp & emerald --replace
[02:55] <bluebanana> aro, on 7.04, but upgrade is troublesome.
[02:55] <nibsa1242b> funkyb: I thought samba was for sharing with windows... but I guess 2 Ubuntu machines could share through it as well. I was trying to do an NFS share, but I can't get either of the computers to see each other.
[02:55] <bluebanana> i want fresh install
[02:55] <funkyb> org, just google for gusty fun
[02:55] <funkyb> oh wait
[02:55] <KillerKiwi2005> How do I add a module option at boot time I need to do    "modprobe saa7134 pinnacle_remote=1" at boot ?
[02:55] <Arenlor> tux did you "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager" exactly like that? Try it again and tell me what it says
[02:55] <K3nt> !mount
[02:55] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted (also "man mkfs" for formatting) - Mounting partitions in Gnome under Dapper: System -> Administration -> Disks - For Edgy, see !fstab and !DiskMounter
[02:55] <coz_> element, then go to http://pastebin.ca and paste the output from the terminal after you have done that last command
[02:55] <mark_> Blama: try the HAL mailing list: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal
[02:55] <funkyb> I thought you said NTFS sharing, so i assumed win
[02:55] <aro> bluebanana, do this
[02:55] <ader10> How do I run 32 bit programs on a 64 bit cpu (64 bit linux)
[02:55] <aro> bluebanana, in terminal, less /etc/proc/meminfo
[02:55] <org> funkyb, Didn't give me good results. I need a url for starters.
[02:55] <aro> tell me what memtotal says
[02:56] <Jaggs> well it appears I lost my help...
[02:56] <tux> Arenlor: it says its already the newest version. but it still doesn't load
[02:56] <funkyb> org - check out conky, get compiz spinning all purdy like, and I like to google Ubuntu customization for theme and eye candy stuffs
[02:56] <K3nt> !DiskMounter
[02:56] <ubotu> ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[02:56] <element> i can't see the terminal after i do the command
[02:56] <element> its a white screen
[02:56] <Arenlor> tux the command line for it is ccsm
[02:56] <funkyb> transparent terminals in compiz are easy and nice
[02:56] <nibsa1242b> I need help sharing files between 2 (or more) Ubuntu machines. any takers?
[02:56] <element> wait
[02:56] <element> let me try again
[02:56] <coz_> element, and you are using nvidia card right
[02:56] <knix> What's the metapackage that installs all the libc-dev stuff
[02:56] <Arenlor> tux please put ccsm into the terminal (no sudo)
[02:56] <bluebanana> aro: "/etc/proc/meminfo: No such file or directory"
[02:57] <element> ya
[02:57] <coz_> element, then you dont have the drivers installed or installed correctly
[02:57] <MenZa> knix: Might it be libc6?
[02:57] <MenZa> knix: Just a guess.
[02:57] <tux> Arenlor: okay now what
[02:57] <K3nt> can someoen help me mount my vista partition? the guide on the ubuntu site is outdate
[02:57] <knix> MenZa: no there's a metapackage that installs a bunch fo headers
[02:57] <ader10> How do I run 32 bit programs on 64 bit linux?
[02:57] <element> i just did sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
[02:57] <coz_> element, did you also do the nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24
[02:57] <MenZa> knix: Ah. Then pass, sorry.
[02:57] <Arenlor> tux press enter if you didn't and it should load something
[02:57] <element> yes
[02:57] <luks> tekken 6
[02:57] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: here is the problem I think with fglrx and dri. kernel log says "[fglrx] Internal AGP is not sup
[02:57] <Cryoniq> ported in 2.6 kernel." and on ATI's homepage it says: "Note: 	In order to use the fglrx internal AGP support, you have to make sure that the kernel agpgart support is not active, i.e. it is not compiled into the kernel and the kernel modules are not loaded. If the fglrx kernel module detects that the kernel agpgart support is active, it will automatically use that even if its internal AGP support is requested in order to avoid conf
[02:57] <Cryoniq> licts that can cause problems under some circumstances."
[02:58] <bluebanana> what's the difference between alternate and main isos? Is one faster than the other?
[02:58] <bluebanana> (For gutsy)
[02:58] <knix> alternative has text-based installer
[02:58] <MenZa> !alternate | bluebanana
[02:58] <ubotu> bluebanana: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD - See also !Minimal
[02:58] <dt1> hi all
[02:58] <coz_> element, ok i dont normally do support on this channel since this is ubuntu in general you may want to go to #compiz-fusion for support there  i wont be ther today because i am installing gutsy
[02:58] <MenZa> I peronally prefer the alternate disk, bluebanana
[02:58] <tomd123> hi
[02:58] <dt1> might someone be able to help me with my problems conscerning my 7.10 upgrade?
[02:58] <paradizelost> hey all. I just did a fresh install of a 7.10 server, what's the best way to get either gnome or kde, but no kdm/gdm ?
[02:58] <tux> Arenlor: it didn't It gave me an AttributeError. (AttributeError: 'compizconfig.Plugin' object has no attribute 'Initialized')
[02:58] <bluebanana> so, since i'm no expert, i should go for the Main/Desktop cd, yes?
[02:58] <bluebanana> MenZa: why do you prefere alternate?
[02:58] <Madpilot> dt1, just ask, please don't ask to ask.
[02:58] <kevleviathan> funkyb: would you happen to be able to help me out for a sec on how you set up ndiswrapper?
[02:58] <Ryuho> what do i have to kill to restart wifi connection?
[02:58] <ader10> How do I run 32 bit programs on 64 bit linux?
[02:59] <coz_> element, however there are several other support people there today  so that would be the best place to go at this point
[02:59] <mark_> nibsa1242b: re: file sharing, try ubuntuguide.org, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Feisty#How_to_share_folders_the_easy_way
[02:59] <element> k
[02:59] <dt1> I can't get miro to update.  It worked fine in feisty
[02:59] <MenZa> bluebanana: I find it's less... uh, distractive. And it's easy enough to use. It's got a better partition editor and such. If you've never installed Ubuntu before, go with the desktop CD.
[02:59] <wastrel> paradizelost: just install ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop  and turn off gdm or kdm
[02:59] <axisys> i noticed if i choose visual effects my gnome takes us about 400M .. outch! system gets really slow.. wasnt like this w/ beryl on fiesty fawn
[02:59] <K3nt> apparently, using diskmounter, No usable windows/mac partitions found
[02:59] <dt1> and now when I try to load
[02:59] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I think that might be part of the problem, but I don't know how to fix it. Sounds like you'd need to compile your own kernel.
[02:59] <axisys> any tip to fix that?
[02:59] <dt1> it tells me that I need to update
[02:59] <coz_> element, you can talk to severl people  adamk  if he is there   crdlb  jupiter1tx  or amphi
[02:59] <nibsa1242b> mark_: I tried that. Didn't work.
[02:59] <paradizelost> dt1: the mirrors are getting hit very hard today. try several times, several hours apart
[02:59] <RoC_MasterMind> Why does the VLC in gutsy NOT pause/play when I hit spacebar?
[02:59] <mark_> Ryuho: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[02:59] <RoC_MasterMind> It did in feisty.
[02:59] <Blama[STOLZEN]> mark_ Hmm, do you know why I wouldn't be able to Device Manager? It opens for a second and then closes
[02:59] <dt1> but update won't allow me to click the version
[02:59] <tux> Arenlor: it didn't It gave me an AttributeError. (AttributeError: 'compizconfig.Plugin' object has no attribute 'Initialized') so now what?
[02:59] <Arenlor> tux that seems to be a bug, report it on launchpad
[03:00] <mark_> nibsa1242b: didn't work how?
[03:00] <Ryuho> mark_ that doesn't work
[03:00] <Arenlor> Amaranth you on?
[03:00] <coz_> element, jupiter1tx has extensive nvidia experience
[03:00] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: yeah.. =( and only kernel i compiled was in slakware like 10 years ago.. once.. :D
[03:00] <tux> Arenlor: how am i going to do that?
[03:00] <bluebanana> MenZa:  i've installed ubuntu before
[03:00] <Jaggs> Ok I know I lost my help
[03:00] <mark_> Blama[STOLZEN]: No, I don't.
[03:00] <nibsa1242b> mark_: my machines can't see eachother
[03:00] <dt1> paradizelost: I am currently running 7.1
=== Blama[STOLZEN] is now known as Blama
[03:00] <bluebanana> installing with desktop/main cd is slower than text-based/alternate cd, true or false?
[03:00] <coz_> element, although he does not use ubuntu

[03:00] <Ryuho> mark_ how would i manually set the connection? is there a command you can refer me to?
[03:00] <MenZa> bluebanana: True.
[03:00] <tux> !launchpad
[03:00] <ubotu> Launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/
[03:00] <Jaggs> is there someone else who an help me get my wireless card up and running?
[03:00] <paradizelost> dt1: yes, if you are trying to do an apt-get update and such, the servers are getting hit hard today. try tomorrow or so.
[03:00] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: I still think your best bet is to use the open source driver somehow.
[03:00] <testify> Why is roaming mode for wireless cards so impossibly AWESOME...but manual sucks arse?
[03:01] <kevleviathan> Jaggs: I'm having the same problem
[03:01] <ader10> How do I run 32 bit programs on 64 bit linux?
[03:01] <dt1> oh
[03:01] <kevleviathan> Jaggs: you using a broadcom wireless?
[03:01] <mark_> nibsa1242b: Try asking on a Samba or SMB mailing list. That's the file sharing software
[03:01] <dt1> ok
[03:01] <dt1> thanks
[03:01] <Peaker> I am trying to change my X resolution with gvidm, and it usually works, but sometimes it ceases to work until I restart my X server, and there's no error message or such to debug the problem
[03:01] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: also explains why it worked in feisty probably.. below this kernel version.
[03:01] <alexre1> does anyone know if there's a FAQ/manual for setting up the compizfusion cube desktop? i'm trying to enable it via the "compizconfig settings manager", but it's not doing anything
[03:01] <Jaggs> yes I am
[03:01] <Kelley> Ugh, I ran into a problem using Partimage to clone my drive
[03:01] <watchme> hi all...

[03:01] <Blama> Does anyone know why I would not be able to open the Device Manager? It closes as soon as it opens.
[03:01] <kevleviathan> Jaggs: I've been trying forever, can't get it to work
[03:01] <coz_> alexre1,  make sure the desktop cube and the rotate cube plugins are enabled
[03:01] <Arenlor> jaa /part time for me
[03:01] <warbler> alexrel: there is the chat - #compiz-fusion
[03:01] <Jaggs> well im in #1390
[03:01] <mark_> Ryuho: manually set the wireless connection? Click the networking applet icon, or 'man ifconfig' on hte command line.
[03:01] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: was thinking about that during restart.. but I think it is the same problem with the open source driver also..
[03:02] <Kelley> Its asking me for the image file to create/use. I want to put the image on an external drive but I don't know how to tell it to do that.
[03:02] <mark_> Ryuho: you should be able to handle it graphically.
[03:02] <Kelley> Can anybody help me?
[03:02] <Jaggs> maybe if we can find someone to help us they can knock us both out in one shot
[03:02] <bluebanana> so i should just get text based installer, if i want speed yes?
[03:02] <Lerris> if anyone knows of how to fix a problem with dvd-r burning with sata (phillips drive) using amd64 version of gutsy with a SiI 3114 chipset, i'd kind of like to get this working.
[03:02] <Ryuho> mark_ ok ill try
[03:02] <paradizelost> bluebanana: or if you have oddball hardware
[03:02] <K3nt> can someone help me out with this error? "No usable windows/mac partitions found"
[03:02] <mark_> !ask
[03:02] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:02] <allobjects> I have upgraded a previously perfectly running 7.04 to 7.10 (running as a virtual box VM on windose host) but it now fails to start xserver, I can ping the machine from elsewhere but unfortunatelyhave not enabled ssh yet so can't get in. Any suggestions ?
[03:02] <nibsa1242b> mark_: besides it doesn't tell me what ports to open
[03:02] <MenZa> Yeah, bluebanana.
[03:02] <watchme> I got a new HDD. Now I want to copy the old one to the new 1:1 . Are there any suggestions, how I can do that (Including Partitions and MBR) ?
[03:02] <MenZa> K3nt: Well, what's the problem?
[03:02] <kevleviathan> Jaggs: what methods have you tried? I've tried the BCM43xx_fwcutter firmware which won't work, also the ndiswrapped method which also doesn't work
[03:03] <mark_> nibsa1242b: open all ports temporarily for testing.
[03:03] <Blama> Does anyone know why I would not be able to open the Device Manager? It closes as soon as it opens.
[03:03] <Lerris> ARe the hard drives exactly identical watchme?
[03:03] <paradizelost> watchme: dd is the command you want if they are the exact same drive
[03:03] <K3nt> im trying to mount my vista partition but its not getting recognized (above error)
[03:03] <mark_> nibsa1242b: both computers are on the same network?
[03:03] <MenZa> K3nt: Ah. What are you using to mount it?
[03:03] <knix> MenZa: build-essentials was the one :)
[03:03] <Kelley> Anybody?
[03:03] <allobjects> is there something I can do during the boot process ? it drops to text boot saying xserver stopped 6 time in 90 sec waiting for 2 min
[03:03] <watchme> paradizelost: nope unfortunaly they arent
[03:03] <mark_> Kelley: Just ask. Don't ask to ask.
[03:03] <nibsa1242b> Cryoniq: feisty was still 2.6.x; you can try booting with a feisty kernel... I remember someone saying that fixed the fglrx suspend issue
[03:03] <MenZa> knix: Oh yeah; that installs build tools and stuff. :)
[03:03] <Jaggs> ive got the wrapper in there and then i attempted to get some drivers for it... Ive done all I can do on my own
[03:03] <paradizelost> watchme: generally i use ghost for that
[03:03] <K3nt> MenZa:  sudo bash diskmounter
[03:03] <watchme> the old one is an 40GB IDE and the new one is a 160GB SATA
[03:03] <ader10> How do I run 32 bit programs on 64 bit linux?
[03:03] <Lerris> well you need to create the partitions and then copy the files with a live cd
[03:03] <Jaggs> I have gotta habe someone who knows the system better than I do
[03:04] <Kelley> Mark_: I asked above, but nobody answered :P
[03:04] <RoC_MasterMind> Why does the VLC in gutsy NOT pause/play when I hit spacebar?
[03:04] <MenZa> K3nt: Sounds like you might have to mount it manually.
[03:04] <Lerris> then copy the master boot record with dd.  (i don't remember the details)
[03:04] <nibsa1242b> mark_: yes, both on the same network, both running Gusty, and I wanted to do it with NFS but I don't mind going SMB
[03:04] <Lerris> or just install grub again
[03:04] <Jaszbo> Hi...I am installing on an HP dv6646us, and it is hanging up at 85%...can anyone help me get past this point?
[03:04] <bluebanana> maybe you guys can help me now, when I did the _upgrade_ from 7.04 to 7.10, the system didn't have my monitors in their list of monitors (under Screen resolution). I have NEC MultiSync FP2141SB and an AOC 9Klr. What must I do?
[03:04] <Casey> Is there a way to play password protected MMS streams?
[03:04] <paradizelost> ader10: there should'nt be anything to do, just run them
[03:04] <K3nt> MenZa: good thing i have free time, :)
[03:04] <kevleviathan> Jaszbo, is it stuck at "scanning"?
[03:04] <MenZa> Jaszbo: Using the LiveCD?
[03:04] <Cryoniq> nibsa1242b: doesn't hurt to try and rip xorg-glx, the restricted drivers and make sure the open source is only in system. remember that under feisty one couldnt have any trace from the restriced while the open source was there or it would fail for some reason.
[03:04] <Blama> Does anyone know why I would not be able to open the Device Manager? It closes as soon as it opens.
[03:04] <MenZa> K3nt: Right; second.
[03:04] <Kelley> I'm trying to figure out how to tell Partition Image to make the image of my disk onto a usb drive
[03:04] <Jaszbo> No the alt install cd
[03:04] <watchme> paradizelost: is there an "opensource-Ghost" ?
[03:04] <bluebanana> I'm just worried that I'll have problems with my monitors when i do a fresh/clean install.
[03:04] <RoC_MasterMind> ader10, I don't think that's possible...is it?
[03:04] <paradizelost> nibsa1242b: i recommend NFS, but samba is easier
[03:04] <Cryoniq> err.. xserver-xgl etc.. totaly wrong of me above there.. :D
[03:04] <mark_> nibsa1242b: To do NFS, you need to have exactly matched user IDs.
[03:04] <RoC_MasterMind> The only exception might be
[03:05] <paradizelost> watchme: never looked, i've got legit licenses, and have for a very long time
[03:05] <RoC_MasterMind> !flash64 > ader10
[03:05] <testify> I'm having an issue with my Dlink DWL AG530 wireless network card. It works just fine in roaming mode, but when I try and configure it manually, I either get no connection shown in 'iwconfig' or no IP from DHCP (I am trying to configure a static IP address for my WPA wireless network).
[03:05] <MenZa> Uhumm... K3nt, the guide seems to be missing, so I'll talk you through it
[03:05] <mark_> Kelley: You are trying to make a disk image to be a live file system on a USB drive?
[03:05] <paradizelost> mark_: not necessarily, you can open up by ip, to have full rights
[03:05] <nibsa1242b> mark_: I need to know the other computers user ID or both have to login with the same ID?
[03:05] <MenZa> K3nt: Do you know the location of the device, e.g. /dev/sdax, /dev/sdbx, /dev/hdax etc.?

[03:07] <mark_> Kelley: do you care whether the result on the USB drive is a live file system or an "image" file?
[03:07] <paradizelost> NemesisD: yes, there's an issue with the tzdata package, it apears it gets kinda skipped during the downloads because the servers are getting hit hard
[03:07] <Jaggs> kevleviathan: the channel I have help on
[03:07] <ader10> "RoC_MasterMind wants you to know: You can run Flash, Real, and Java plugins in AMD64 bit computers with Firefox. " I don't care about firefox right now.... I've got that working fine. I want to know how to use the installer (32 bit) for ETQW.
[03:07] <jimmacdonald> Having an odd problem. I just upgraded to Gutsy on my unbuntu box and I am having difficulty with my wired NIC. I am setup on a router through to a cable modem and when I boot up I have to manually initiate dhcp. If I set my network connect to DHCP my browser and email fail to work. but IRC and chat works just fine.
[03:07] <NemesisD> paradizelost, i actually believe i installed that earlier today
[03:07] <K3nto> MenZa: nope hehe im not sure what its under
[03:07] <oxeimon> I'm getting the error "No root file system is defined. Please correc this from the partitioning menu", while trying to install 7.10
[03:08] <ader10> RoC_MasterMind: Have any idea how to get an installer to work? (a 32 bit one)
[03:08] <Jaggs> litterlaly type "/go to#1390/"
[03:08] <numus> anyone know why the nvidia drivers are not working for me.. if i switch to them it reverts to the vesa drivers
[03:08] <NemesisD> paradizelost, one of the packages left unconfigured was bash, that troubles me, is this going to brick my system?
[03:08] <Kelley> mark_: No, I need it to be just an image file that I can restore to if something goes wrong, but if there is a way to be able to use it as a live file system, that would be good to.
[03:08] <mark_> nibsa1242b: when you try the instructions at http://czarism.com/easy-peasy-ubuntu-linux-nfs-file-sharing, what goes wrong?
[03:08] <warbler> allobjects: the option should be there at the grub menu during boot
[03:08] <RoC_MasterMind> ader10, you got me...I'm not sure if that's possible.
[03:08] <Burlynn> nibsa1242b, im going through the same thing. that link that was posted is horribly out of date ;/
[03:08] <ader10> RoC_MasterMind: :<
[03:08] <MenZa> K3nto: ok, try typing "sudo fdisk -l" (that's a lower-case L, not a capital i) and paste it in a pastebin, then link me to it
[03:08] <paradizelost> NemesisD: i had the issue on 2 systems, it was faster to just reinstall them, so i did
[03:08] <axisys> any ubuntu user with compiz-fusion ? i see my laptop is slow.. how do I get aiglx w/ compiz fusion
[03:08] <RoC_MasterMind> ader10, that's why I think it's best to stick with 32-bit for the foreseeable future.  A lot of software is 32-bit only.
[03:08] <zetheroo> screen expansion anyone?
[03:08] <numus> anyone know why the nvidia drivers are not working for me.. if i switch to them it reverts to the vesa drivers
[03:08] <mark_> Kelley, is the USB drive empty, and larger than the file system to back up?
[03:08] <RoC_MasterMind> ader10, and a lot more is 64-bit only on Intel/AMD
[03:09] <paradizelost> ader10: i agree with him for the time being
[03:09] <|neon|> iplist does not install on gutsy because of libnfnetlink1 any suggestions
[03:09] <NemesisD> paradizelost, feh i have a lot of data and settings that i don't particularly want to lose
[03:09] <Lerris> I take it no one has had any issues getting sata dvd writers to work?
[03:09] <mark_> Kelley: and you want to backup a windows drive ?
[03:09] <biggahed> hello there. Im trying gutsy amd64. Is there any 'it sucks huge amounts of ram' issue known?
[03:09] <oxeimon> I'm having trouble installing ubuntu, I get the error "No root file system defined."  while I'm in the Prepare Partitions window...
[03:09] <nibsa1242b> when I type sudo mount [IPaddress of computer with shared dir]:/shareddir/ [local mountpoint] I get " mount: special device [ip address] doesn't exist
[03:09] <paradizelost> NemesisD: this is why we do multiple partitions, and only format the system partition
[03:09] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, what does the 2nd line of free -m say?
[03:09] <paradizelost> ;)
[03:09] <ader10> RoC_MasterMind: I guess I can use 32 bit if there's no other option, but I think it would be nice to see some blender render times go down a little :P
=== benzss is now known as benzs_s
[03:09] <Kelley> mark_: Yes, I am trying to back up my windows drive. I have an external USB drive about exactly the same size as the drive I am trying to clone
[03:09] <K3nto> MenZa: http://pastebin.com/m74e476e6
[03:09] <wastrel> oxeimon: you have to set the label to  /  on the partition you want to use as your root partition
[03:09] <Lerris> i have amd64 running, and other than a graphics card stability issue, which is likely the nvidia driver, and a dvd writer issue, all seems well
[03:09] <numus> anyone know why the nvidia drivers are not working for me.. if i switch to them it reverts to the vesa drivers

=== marcosoria_ is now known as marcosoria81
[03:10] <DanMulvey> is there any advantage right now to going with the 64 bit distro?
[03:10] <Kelley> mark_: However, the drive I want to clone has two partitions, one is a 5gb recovery made by HP, and the other is Windows itself.
[03:10] <suupaabaka> man
[03:10] <MenZa> OK, K3nto, we're looking at either sda2 or sda3
[03:10] <Smegzor> Can I upgrade 7.04 to 7.10 using the 7.10 cd?  How do I do it?
[03:10] <Lerris> supports more memory, a little faster
[03:10] <suupaabaka> gutsy is great
[03:10] <oxeimon> wastrel: The label? Do you mean the Mount Point?
[03:10] <paradizelost> numus: do you happen to have the Nvidia Geforce 8800 series?
[03:10] <NemesisD> paradizelost, wish somebody would have let me in on that tip when i was setting it up
[03:10] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, your not reading it correctly
[03:10] <MenZa> !alternate | Smegzor
[03:10] <RoC_MasterMind> I said the 2nd line
[03:10] <ubotu> Smegzor: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD - See also !Minimal
[03:10] <RoC_MasterMind> free -m
[03:10] <numus> paradizelost no pny vetro fx 5500
[03:10] <wastrel> oxeimon: sure ,mount point if that's what it says :]
[03:10] <racarter> back
[03:10] <mark_> Kelley, 'dd' may work, with a syntax similiar to this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)#Examples    Because it's so low level, it really doesn't care much about the file system.
[03:10] <racarter> my sound card is not working...
[03:11] <NemesisD> paradizelost, so is it most likely that these left unconfigured errors will just ruin the system?
[03:11] <racarter> and i dont know how to fix it
[03:11] <MenZa> K3nto: Could you try creating a directory for test mounting, e.g. /media/wintest? (sudo mkdir /media/wintest)
[03:11] <oxeimon> wastrel: Right now the mount point is "/media/sda2"
[03:11] <mark_> Kelley: Still I might make an second backup of critical documents separately.
[03:11] <|neon|> ipblock does not install on gutsy because of libnfnetlink1 any suggestions
[03:11] <peepsalot> damn this upgrade is gonna take forever.  already been going 3 hours, says there's 6 more to go
[03:11] <mr_wang> why the hell does it take ubuntu 20 minits to start ? i just upgraded?
[03:11] <thedefender> does this channel now support gutsy
[03:11] <slyder> i'm trying to run a patch for frozen bubble so i can play the old version 1.0 instead of the new version, how do i run the patch? and do i do it before i compile it?
[03:11] <eugo> what program shows cpu temp etc?
[03:11] <geirha> Smegzor: you can add the cd as a repository, but most of the packages will still be downloaded from the net afaik
[03:11] <MenZa> Yes, thedefender
[03:11] <jimmacdonald> anyone?
[03:11] <nibsa1242b> Burlynn: the problem is I can't seem to find a more up to date link
[03:11] <mark_> Kelley: another option may be creating a dual boot system (at least for now) and leaving Windows intact for a bit.
[03:11] <Kelley> mark_: Yeah, thats probably a good idea. In fact, I may just abandon the idea of cloning the drive in the first place. Cloning seems abit complicated for me right now
[03:11] <paradizelost> thedefender: gutsy is final, so yes
[03:11] <Burlynn> nibsa1242b, same here
[03:11] <racarter> sound card?
[03:11] <biggahed> RoC_MasterMind, it is the second line, if you count the labels like total used etc. Is this what you meant? -/+ buffers/cache:        859       1154
[03:11] <numus> anyone know why the nvidia drivers are not working for me.. if i switch to them it reverts to the vesa drivers
[03:11] <XXer> Iv tried all the suggestions but non have worked could someone tell me what (./configure ) in line No.3 of the install instructions mean 1. tar -xzvf scourge-XX.tar.gz
[03:11] <XXer> 2. cd scourge-XX
[03:11] <XXer> 3. ./configure
[03:11] <XXer> 4. make
[03:11] <XXer> 5. ./src/scourge
[03:12] <geirha> Smegzor: at least that was my experience going from 6.10 to 7.04
[03:12] <Kelley> mark_: Yeah, thats what I am planning on doing. I just want to have my Backup incase the partitioner screws up my disk
[03:12] <|neon|> eugo: you need lm sensors then you can use like ksensors if kde and for gnom eii dunno
[03:12] <racarter> can i use dmesg to find out what kind of sound card i have?
[03:12] <K3nto> MenZa: kk i made it
[03:12] <eugo> kk thx
[03:12] <racarter> dmesg by itself gives me a lot of info..
[03:12] <MenZa> racarter: lspci
[03:12] <paradizelost> XXer: read the README file in the folder
[03:12] <wastrel> oxeimon: that's probably where it mounted for th e install process ?  i haven't done the gusty installer
[03:12] <thedefender> i am running the beta, and have not received any updates since it was made final, or 2 days prior to it being made final
[03:12] <paradizelost> racarter: either dmesg or lspci
[03:12] <wastrel> racarter: try lspci
[03:12] <mark_> Kelley, ask the user about the critical doucments and files they care about... and maybe do a special export of e-mail. Often, the files people are really care about are a fraction the size of the whole drive.
[03:12] <thedefender> is this something to do with the repos
[03:12] <MenZa> K3nto: Right, now try sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda2 /media/wintest && ls /media/wintest
[03:12] <nibsa1242b> ok, I feel dumb, but now everytime I hit a key to type in this window my internal pc speaker is beeping. how do I turn that off?
[03:13] <racarter> i am pretty sure the sound card is built into the system board
[03:13] <numus> paradizelost: any idea?
[03:13] <Kelley> mark_: Yeah, its really my Mom and Dads computer. All they really care about is their iTunes library, documents and quicken
[03:13] <racarter> i dont know if lspci says anything about sound.. i am not seeing it right now
[03:13] <paradizelost> numus: about?
[03:13] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, yeah the first number on the 2nd line is how much it's using.  the first line is actual physical use, which should be as close to using all of your RAM as possible.  My system uses 292 MB of RAM right now...yours looks like 859MB...which is a lot.
[03:13] <K3nto> MenZa: ok, i can see SOME of the folders that were on my C drive, but some are missing. uh-oh lol
[03:13] <numus> paradizelost: why my video card isn't working
[03:13] <Lerris> if you want to backup a drive, i tend to use something like 'tar cfvz backup.tar.gz .' when in the directory to be backed up
[03:13] <paradizelost> Kelley: then you probably want to dualboot
[03:13] <mark_> Kelley: And email. :) (unless htey have web-based email)
[03:13] <paradizelost> numus: did you say you ARE running an 8800 series?
[03:14] <numus> paradizelost:  no 5500
[03:14] <MenZa> K3nto: Ubuntu shouldn't have changed anything, unless you specifically told it to.
[03:14] <Lerris> or alternatively have that backup file on your removable drive.
[03:14] <paradizelost> numus: then i couldn't tell ya atm
[03:14] <XXer> There is no readme file
[03:14] <mark_> Kelley: I switched my dad (age 60) to Linux and Gmail from Windows and AOL. He's sticking with it.  It can work!
[03:14] <racarter> i am very impressed with gnome so far by the way
[03:14] <MenZa> K3nto: try sudo umount /dev/sda2 && sudo mount /dev/sda3 -t ntfs /media/wintest && ls /media/wintest
[03:14] <K3nto> MenZa: I could have lol. anyway, lets continue. i backed up important things
[03:14] <numus> paradizelost: when i use the nvidia drivers.. and restart x it goes to the vesa drivers
[03:14] <IntuitiveNipple> Kelley: if the drives are the same size (I think you said), then open a terminal (Applications/Accessories) and then do "dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY" (where X & Y are your internal and external drives) - this will copy the *entire* drive image including Master Boot Record and partition table, and all partitions
[03:14] <paradizelost> XXer: what is this that you are trying to get support for here?
[03:14] <paradizelost> what program?
[03:14] <racarter> looks nice... i still hate that toolbar on the top of the screen though
[03:14] <thedefender> i am running the beta, and have not received any updates since it was made final, or 2 days prior to it being made final
[03:14] <racarter> i always end up taking it off
[03:14] <mark_> Kelley: What will you replace Quicken with?
[03:14] <thedefender> is this something to do with the repos
[03:15] <racarter> where do i find the adobe acrobat reader plugin?
[03:15] <MenZa> thedefender: Your machine should be pretty much up to date; the packages are made available whenever they're done.
[03:15] <paradizelost> racarter: kubuntu may meet your wishes then. ;)
[03:15] <biggahed> RoC_MasterMind, thats exactly what i thought :) And im not even have tons of apps open
[03:15] <Kelley> mark_: Yeah, my dads abit older but pretty computer literate. Its just that his windows disk got so screwed up that instead of reinstalling windows, I will just have him use Ubuntu most of the time
[03:15] <IntuitiveNipple> Kelley: You can also use dd to image individual partitions using "dd if=/dev/sdX? of=/dev/sdY?" (where ? are the internal and external partition numbers)
[03:15] <K3nto> MenZa: http://pastebin.com/f19eb46bb
[03:15] <racarter> apt-cache search adobe doesn't find anything
[03:15]  * ader10 fetches a copy of 32 bit instead this time
[03:15] <biggahed> i dont even have*
[03:15] <racarter> i dont have to switch to kubuntu just for a toolbar though...
[03:15] <arghh2d2> I'm trying to resize my root partition to make a new partition, is this possible?
[03:15] <mark_> IntuitiveNipple: And that will work fine for an NTFS partition, too?
[03:16] <CaBlGuY> !VCD
[03:16] <MenZa> ok, K3nto, would you say the first one seemed like your C drive?
[03:16] <thedefender> MenZa: so then the original repos in the will provided the final updates
[03:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about vcd - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[03:16] <Kelley> IntuitiveNipple: So using the first of those commands would let me copy everything? Thats another good option. Thanks
[03:16] <racarter> i have a question about ntfs too.. i have a lot of questions today actually
[03:16] <CaBlGuY> Hmmmm
[03:16] <paradizelost> arghh2d2: from a livecd, yes, not if you are booted into the system you are trying to do it on
[03:16] <IntuitiveNipple> mark_: It is below the level of the file-system within the partitions - it is at the block-device (aka disk) level
[03:16] <K3nto> MenZa: yeah
[03:16] <CaBlGuY> I need some codex for watchin VCD's..
[03:16] <jimmacdonald> still trying to get some networking help.
[03:16] <CaBlGuY> !ogle
[03:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ogle - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[03:16] <CaBlGuY> hmmm
[03:16] <MenZa> K3nto: that's fine, I just needed to establish that
[03:16] <Scunizi> !ask > Scunizi
[03:16] <mark_> Kelley: Yes, but use "df -h" to figure out your own values for X and Y.
[03:17] <IntuitiveNipple> mark_: So, yes, it will copy any Windows partition as a literal image
[03:17] <XXer> <paradizelost>this is my first attempt at installing a game without using the (add/remove app) from a .gz file
[03:17] <arghh2d2> paradizelost: i see thanks
[03:17] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, install "htop"
[03:17] <Kelley> mark_: I don't plan on having use Ubuntu exclusively. He uses quicken sparingly, and until he gets comfortable using Ubuntu, I will just have him switch back and forth between the two
[03:17] <biggahed> RoC_MasterMind, usage with i386 was more like yours. Are you using the 64bits version?
[03:17] <racarter> is there a way to put the address bar in nautilus? in case i want to manually type the folder i want to go to?
[03:17] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, it will let you sort by memory usage
[03:17] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, no, 32.
[03:17] <coreymanshack> hi, why is it that when i have a full screen video up it takes up like 55% of my processor? does my graphix card suck that bad?
[03:17] <BigCanOfTuna> I'd like to set up a RAID one configuration for media storage, can I add the two drives leaving my original drive with ubuntu as the primary?
[03:17] <IntuitiveNipple> Kelley: You could have him use Ubuntu all the time and use the QEMU emulator to run a Windows image to host Quicken
[03:17] <RoC_MasterMind> biggahed, 64-bit code might use more ram.
[03:17] <MenZa> K3nto: now try this command: sudo mkdir /media/windows && echo "/dev/sda2 /media/windows ntfs defaults 0 0 " | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab && sudo rmdir /media/wintest
[03:18] <paradizelost> XXer: tonight might be the wrong night to try to get help on that then. being a new version release...
[03:18] <mark_> Kelley: OK.  Take a look at moneydance. It runs on Windows and Linux, and is what my wife switched to. Because it ran Windows, it was easy for her to evaluate
[03:18] <marcosoria81> hi everyone, i know all of you are really busy, i need help setting up compiz on gutsy gibbon, thanks
[03:18] <IntuitiveNipple> Kelley: It would save on reboots, and user interface confusions
[03:18] <XXer> o ic
[03:18] <K3nto> MenZa: i guess it worked, hold on
[03:18] <mark_> Kelley: But one thing at a time. :) Just trying out Linux will be enough for now, I'm sure. :)
[03:18] <flick> if i install a .deb file, how do i uninstall it?
[03:18] <arghh2d2> After resizing and creating a new ext2 part, i intend to burn the 7.10 iso and boot it using my 7.4's grub installation, is this possible?
[03:18] <MenZa> K3nto: now try sudo mount /media/windows
[03:18] <MenZa> flick: sudo dpkg -r <filename>.deb
[03:19] <MenZa> (-r being remove)
[03:19] <jvon> anyone care to help me with my upgrading woes?
[03:19] <biggahed> RoC_MasterMind, it should use more ram... but i didnt think it would be so much. i think this is buggy, because ive ran other 64bits distros before and it didnt show this behavior
[03:19] <mark_> flick: or you can use synaptic.
[03:19] <jimmacdonald> jvon, you and me both.
[03:19] <Kelley> IntuitiveNipple: Thats a good idea, and yeah, you are right. I am thinking about just setting up quicken in Wine, wouldn't that work? Moneydance sounds like a good alternitive like mark_ said
[03:19] <Dicey> Is the "AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core Processor 5600+" a 64 bit processor. Need to know which gutsy iso to download
[03:19] <flick> mark_, installing a .deb will make it show up in synaptic?
[03:19] <NemesisD> holy crap
[03:19] <theacolyte> Just installed apache2, and I can access html fine but PHP doesn't seem to be working... also of note, my httpd.conf is completely blank
[03:19] <theacolyte> Dicey: yes and AMD64 will work
[03:19] <NemesisD> could not configure sudo, gksu, that doesn't sound good
=== alien18_ is now known as alien18
[03:19] <mark_> flick: I think so.
[03:19] <Dicey> thanks
[03:20] <MenZa> NemesisD: No, no it doesn't. :S
[03:20] <arghh2d2> hmmm, let me rephrase that, After resizing and creating a new ext2 part, i intend to put  the 7.10 iso on it  and boot it using my 7.4's grub installation, is this possible?
[03:20] <NemesisD> wow this is wonderful
[03:20] <theacolyte> and by php not working, I mean it asks me to download the file
[03:20] <biggahed> RoC_MasterMind, for the mem usage... firefox is king(as usual) but its not that much, just 123 of resident mem. its more like all the other apps are using a hell lot more ram
[03:20] <IntuitiveNipple> Kelley: Wine *may* do it but you'd need to check the compatibility lists, and for something so important I'd rather not risk financial data :p
[03:20] <NemesisD> so glad i decided to upgrade :|
[03:20] <mark_> Kelley: Quicken in Wine might work. appdb.winehq.org and codeweavers.com have good WINE compatibility databases.
[03:20] <MenZa> theacolyte: you're missing an apache module
[03:20] <K3nto> MenZa: yeah i think i messed something up with Gparted. I only have two folders in my program files...
=== TheDreamer is now known as Youri
[03:20] <NemesisD> now i get to spend my friday evening fixing my computer
[03:20] <MenZa> K3nto: hmm
[03:20] <MenZa> K3nto: ow
[03:20] <racarter> i need help with my sound card on ubuntu 7.10...
[03:20] <MenZa> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP <- theacolyte
[03:20] <MenZa> !sound | racarter
[03:20] <ubotu> racarter: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[03:20] <theacolyte> MenZa: you would figure, right? But I'm not sure what I could be missing by installing  libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-common php5-curl php5-dev php5-gd php5-idn php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-json php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php5-mhash php5-ming php5-mysql
[03:20] <Kelley> mark_ and IntuitiveNipple: Ok, I will definetly check that out. Thanks alot for your help!
[03:21] <paradizelost> NemesisD: you didn't have anything to do did you ? ;)
[03:21] <Kelley> Bye!
[03:21] <paradizelost> !LAMP
[03:21] <NemesisD> oh awesome
[03:21] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[03:21] <MenZa> theacolyte: Kinda obvious, but try restarting apache.
[03:21] <NemesisD> and then the update manager just closes
[03:21] <theacolyte> MenZa: already did
[03:21] <NemesisD> says it can't get an exclusive lock
[03:21] <jlilly> anyone found a solution for dual monitor setups being shown as one screen? nvidia-settings errors saying I'm not using their driver (but I am) and its rather frustrating.
[03:21] <MenZa> theacolyte: hmm, that's odd.

[03:21] <thedefender> !ask | racarter
[03:21] <ubotu> racarter: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:21] <Kiron> somebody already installed the SNMP in ubuntu?
[03:21] <MenZa> K3nto: Does it mount, though?
[03:22] <K3nto> MenZa: so that DID work to show me all the contents on my windows partition, right? if thats the case, then ill just reformat and put fresh installs of both windows and ubuntu
[03:22] <K3nto> MenZa: yeah, its mounted
[03:22] <theacolyte> paradizelost: I know what I'm doing -- a bot isn't going to help me though I appreciate the effort
[03:22] <MenZa> Yep, that's correct, K3nto
[03:22] <paradizelost> !snmp | kiron
[03:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about snmp - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[03:22] <IntuitiveNipple> NemesisD: any other software package managers running (that's the usual reason for that error) ?
[03:22] <MenZa> Why do you want to reinstall Ubuntu? :)
[03:22] <codeshah> hey guys - i am using ie6 on wine ... and I am wondering if I can run activex controls in ubuntu?
[03:22] <K3nto> MenZa: i guess it is anyway. should it show up on my desktop?
[03:22] <slaytanic> After installing Ubuntu I get a black screen while booting instead of a pretty loading thingie like on the livecd, is something broken or is it supposed to be this way?
[03:22] <paradizelost> theacolyte: did you follow the howto word for word?
[03:22] <NemesisD> IntuitiveNipple, not a single other thing was running but the update manager
[03:22] <MenZa> K3nto: Erf, I'm not sure.
[03:22] <racarter> my sound doesnt work is not really a question..
[03:22] <MenZa> K3nto: I don't display my volumes on my desktop
[03:22] <zetheroo> I have a couple problems with the new Gutsy
[03:22] <Kiron> somebody already installed the SNMP in ubuntu?
[03:22] <theacolyte> paradizelost: forward and back though I hardly need a howto, this seems more like a bug than anything -- plugging away with it and asking advice in here
[03:23] <Vlet> slaytanic: Does the login screen eventually load?
[03:23] <IntuitiveNipple> NemesisD: Has it run more than once at that point? It could have left a lock-file behind if it terminated abnormally previously
[03:23] <theacolyte> I've only done this a million times
[03:23] <slyder> why when i'm installing packages in synaptic does it keep asking me to insert my gutsy dvd?
[03:23] <zetheroo> for one my logoff sound does not happen anymore
[03:23] <dave___> hey im upgrading to gutsy now and i keep getting errors
[03:23] <jlilly> zetheroo: me too. Dual head support isn't working very well.
[03:23] <dave___> anyone else gteing them
[03:23] <K3nto> MenZa: k. I want to put vista back on though, simply for the compatability of games. Ill get started on that then..
[03:23] <paradizelost> theacolyte: a few versions of apache ago, they moved to multiple config files, rather than everything in the httpd.conf
[03:23] <K3nto> MenZa: alright, thanks for your help!!
[03:23] <MenZa> slyder: Because your DVD is set as a repository :)
[03:23] <NemesisD> IntuitiveNipple, i tried to run it at school today but i closed it and shut down the computer, so i don't think that could be it
[03:23] <dave___> cannot install "xxx" due to dependency errors
[03:23] <zetheroo> jlilly: Dual Head?
[03:23] <slaytanic> Vlet: Yes. and on ¨safe mode¨ I get to see the actual console output.
[03:23] <mpeters> hello there
[03:23] <Vlet> slyder: in your 'software sources' admin control, unckeck the dvd at the bottom
[03:23] <theacolyte> paradizelost: I'm aware of it, thanks though -- this is something else
[03:23] <theacolyte> I'll keep chugging at it
[03:23] <dave___> leaving unconfigured
[03:23] <jlilly> zetheroo: two monitors
[03:23] <MenZa> You can disable it in your list of repositories in Synaptic, slyder, as Vlet says.
[03:23] <slaytanic> Vlet: It's just that I get a black screen until gdm loads.
[03:23] <dave___> am i screwed?
[03:23] <theacolyte> Gonna need to fork this channel :P
[03:23] <oxeimon> should I make my swap partition a logical or primary partition? I have 2GB of RAM, how large should I make my swap partition?
[03:23] <slyder> thanks gonna do that now found this very annoying didn't do this with feisty fawn
[03:24] <slyder> thanks menza and vlet
[03:24] <zetheroo> jlilly: yeah..... I have a Laptop and an LCD pluged into the VGA port....
[03:24] <MenZa> K3nto: good luck with it
[03:24] <NemesisD> ok i just rebooted and it took me to the login prompt and now im just sitting at a light blue screen :)
[03:24] <Vlet> slaytanic: you're the second person I've heard have this problem... it must have something to do with your monitor/video configuartion combination
[03:24] <mpeters> anyone know where i can go to disable the pc speaker?  also wondering if there's a way around the new 64mb restriction i'm running into with compiz fusion
[03:24] <element> hey guys
[03:24] <MenZa> herro
[03:24] <zetheroo> jlilly: the LCD can only fire at 1024x768... thats its manufacturer max res.......
[03:24] <slaytanic> Vlet: So, I _am_ supposed to be seeing something, right?
[03:24] <biggahed> so... does anyone have a clue?
[03:24] <Vlet> slaytanic: yes
[03:24] <jlilly> zetheroo: what problem are you having? Mine is that they both combine into a 2056x1024 resolution instead of 2 at 1280x1024
[03:24] <mpeters> it's muted in volume control. not sure what else i could be missing
[03:24] <element> how do I make my iPod automount?
[03:25] <wastrel> hi
[03:25] <NemesisD> is there any sort of repair install i can do from a cd?
[03:25] <zetheroo> jlilly: but I am having no luck getting screen expansion to work....
[03:25] <theacolyte> I've never seen it where it's telling me to download PHP
[03:25] <org> whats wrong with terminal under gnome now, When i transparent allow, it even transparent everything even XChat or Browser talk. How do i make it only transapert Desktop picture only!
[03:25] <zetheroo> jlilly: ahh I see
[03:25] <theacolyte> the PHP page, rather
[03:25] <racarter> cat /proc/asound/cards --> --- no sound cards ---
[03:25] <up365> marcosoria81, if you have Gutsy then System-Preferences-Advanced Desktop Effects Setting
[03:25] <org> is this a bug even? or what
[03:25] <Vlet> biggahed: if it's been a while since you asked your question, you may want to re-ask.. within reason :)
[03:25] <jlilly> zetheroo: give me a second. Going to try to restart X
[03:25] <tomd123> element, it should detect it and automatically mount it. Just plug it in.
[03:25] <zetheroo> jlilly: ok
[03:25] <funkyb> anyone have hte brightness backwards on their lappy?  when I plug in the AC, screen auto-dims, when I unplug and run on battery, screen auto brightens.
[03:25] <biggahed> Vlet,  okie
[03:25] <zetheroo> can someone help me get the log-off sound working?
[03:26] <biggahed> hello there. Im trying gutsy amd64. Is there any 'it sucks huge amounts of ram' issue known?
[03:26] <Negra> I accidentally erased the networking icon from the panel!!!!
[03:26] <oxeimon> should I make my swap partition a logical or primary partition? I have 2GB of RAM, how large should I make my swap partition?
[03:26] <paradizelost> org: umm why would you want your desktop background to be transparent?
[03:26] <element> not working
[03:26] <gonk23> mpeters: have u tried System->Sound->SystemBeep and untick Enable System Beep?
[03:26] <dga> does rhythmbox have an equalizer?
[03:26] <mark_> org: I suspect that's a "feature" of desktop effects
[03:26] <Vlet> org: it's not a bug, it's "better"... the desktop only transparence was just the way it was because of a lack of hardware acceleration
[03:26] <B_166-ER-X> is there a way to config the 'compiz' desktop ? like in Beryl ?
[03:26] <theacolyte> ah wait, I think I see it -- odd
[03:26] <paradizelost> org: generally true transparency shows what's actualy underneath it
[03:26] <theacolyte> must be a broken package
[03:26] <funkyb> org, mine is slightly transparent.  it's in the cube effects
[03:26] <element> btw what IRC software are you using
[03:26] <IntuitiveNipple> funkyb: check the brightness settings in System > Preferences > Power Management for each
[03:26] <mpeters> gonk23: that would have been far too bloody obvious
[03:26] <Vlet> element: irssi
[03:26] <mpeters> thank you very much :)
[03:26] <funkyb> enable desktop cube, go into it's settings, you can set the normal and cube transparency levels
[03:27] <Negra> how can i restore the networking icon to the panel?
[03:27] <flick> what is the use of apt-get source <package>?
[03:27] <element> can you do that name: thing in konversation?
[03:27] <Akaishi> anyone have any ideas how I might set up a net install to boot on a local machine?
[03:27] <mark_> mpeters:  Are you mpeters@plusthree.com by chance?
[03:27] <zetheroo> also can someone help me get the Ubuntu splash screen working again?
[03:27] <wastrel> Negra: network monitor or network-manager ?
[03:27] <org> yeah I know... but sometime i have terminal and underneath it is an Xchat. then words are into each other. How do you manage that? give me some screenshots of yours let me get an idea!!! :) pls
[03:27] <IntuitiveNipple> oxeimon: If you want to hibernate too, make the swap about 2.25 - 2.5GB. It can be logical or primary.
=== vbabiy_ is now known as vbabiy
[03:27] <Negra> wastrel: manager
[03:27] <up365> Negra, right click on panel-add to panel- scroll down to sys & hardware
[03:27] <mark_> org: I don't use a transparent terminal  (and I don't have a fancy graphics card anyway)
[03:27] <Vlet> org: just make it less transparent
[03:27] <mpeters> mark_: no
[03:28] <B_166-ER-X> where can i enable the Desktop cube on gutsy ??
[03:28] <funkyb> alt+scroll changes window transparency in compiz, is that what you mean?
[03:28] <zetheroo> anyone?
[03:28] <vbabiy> Hey is there a fix for Xchat-gnome in 7.10 for the icons
[03:28] <xblackfire> is posible update ubuntu(server version) with server cd from the console no graphic mode?
[03:28] <org> Vlet, I tried. didn't help it
[03:28] <theacolyte> Wouldn't you expect that you'd see php.load/conf in mods-enabled in apache2 if php installed correctly?
[03:28] <wastrel> Negra: i think that shows up in the notification area
[03:28] <biggahed> B_166-ER-X, custom effects on the desktop effects area
[03:28] <funkyb> B_166, goto appearance and set to extra effects, then google on how to install the compizsettings manager
[03:28] <org> somebody who use transparet terminal show me some SS! pls
[03:28] <Vlet> B_166-ER-X: install the compizconfig-settings-manager package
[03:29] <funkyb> i use trans term
[03:29] <funkyb> Org, give me a minute and I'll link you to howto
[03:29] <ixian_> anyone have an idea why i can't access my router's setup page in ubuntu? i can get to it in windows xp just fine, but when i go to 192.168.1.1 in ubuntu i get 'firefox can't establish connection to the server'
[03:29] <B_166-ER-X> Vlet thnx
[03:29] <mpeters> thanks funkyb. that sounds like advice i can use as well
[03:29] <funkyb> np, happy to help.
[03:29] <trogdor> mark_: instead of a transparent terminal you can make an unwindowed terminal that is your desktop background currently behind it
[03:29] <arghh2d2> I have a question: Using the 7.10 install disk, am i going to be able current system without formatting the whole partition, as in: keep my home directory and settings?
[03:29] <mpeters> i know compiz worked in 7.04 despite a few graphical issues
[03:29] <CowBayPig> ixian - first off, do you have access to the internet?
[03:29] <Powerking89670> night all
[03:29] <Ryuho> where would the list of apps started by different desktop enviorments be
[03:29] <racarter> ok... i still have no idea what to do about my sound
[03:29] <funkyb> but make no mistake, i'm a week old linux nuub
[03:29] <Ryuho> like what file
[03:29] <Akaishi> ixian, is your ubuntu machine using DHCP?
[03:29] <arghh2d2> awwwhg my typing is terrible tonite
[03:29] <trogdor> mark_: I got something like that for eterm, its like terminal camou or something, very kool :)
[03:30] <dga> does anyone use Amarok in GNOME?
[03:30] <B_166-ER-X> i there a simple way to use Emerald instead of well 'themes for gnome'
[03:30] <Vlet> org: what do you mean it didn't help... you get to choose between completely transparent, and not transparent at all. if it were not at all transparent, it would be very visible, and full transparency would be hard to read, so if you set it just a little transparent, wouldn't it be pretty easy to read?
[03:30] <arghh2d2> I have a question: Using the 7.10 install disk, am i going to be able to update the  current system without formatting the whole partition, as in: keep my home directory and settings?
[03:30] <trogdor> dga: no I use exaile, songbird, miro, totem, vlc. lots of edumatainment
[03:30] <org> funkyb, Okay.
[03:30] <funkyb> HOWTO: Transparent Terminal in Compiz-Fusion + gusty:  http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-create-a-transparent-terminal-session-as-your-desktop-background.html
[03:30] <org> funkyb, where is the howto.
[03:30] <Madpilot> arghh2d2, not with the desktop CD. Get the alternate CD if  you want a CD-based upgrade
[03:30] <ixian_> Akaishi: no, i have it set to a static ip address
[03:30] <org> by the way I don't like gnome terminal, anyone have other suggestion of terminals?
[03:31] <zetheroo> arghh2d2: you should get the alternative CD for upgrading
[03:31] <CowBayPig> ixian,do you have access to the internet?
[03:31] <funkyb> you can apply those techs to do lots of neat things, in addition to trans terms
[03:31] <zetheroo> arghh2d2: sorry alternate CD
[03:31] <racarter> what do you call it when you use alt+f1? virtual desktop?
[03:31] <IntuitiveNipple> arghh2d2: Using the LiveCD Desktop installer, no, the partitions will be formatted *unless* you have a separate partition for /home.
[03:31] <NemesisD> is there any way to repair a borked gutsy upgrade?
[03:31] <ixian_> yes CowBayPig
[03:31] <wastrel> hi
[03:31] <ixian_> my router won't even respond to a ping from within linux
[03:31] <racarter> anyway, how do you do it? alt seems to pop up the main menu button now
[03:31] <ixian_> blarg
[03:31] <Akaishi> ixian, is the ubuntu machine's IP on the same subnet with the router?
[03:31] <xblackfire> is posible update ubuntu(server version) with server cd from the console no graphic mode?
[03:31] <mark_> arghh2d2: Are you able to upgrade over the network? If possible, I'd  recommend that.
[03:31] <arghh2d2> Madpilot: zetheroo, sweeet thats what im using, 710 alt server
[03:31] <dga> trogdor: what do you recommend for just music? i used to use amarok in kubuntu but i'm not so sure i want to run it in gnome.
[03:32] <zetheroo> arghh2d2: go for it then.....
[03:32] <trogdor> ixian_: what type of interface and what hardware, is it claimed or disabled/unclaimed in lshw?
[03:32] <chill> hey all
[03:32] <zetheroo> arghh2d2: it will just upgrade your current setup...
[03:32] <racarter> or actually alt+f1 brings up the main menu.. other combinations do different things
[03:32] <flick> there's a .deb package which is more advanced than the one in current Ubuntu source... any way i can put it in so that it can be downloaded with apt-get?
[03:32] <GBenemy> what's nUbuntu?
[03:32] <arghh2d2> one more question, will i be able to get a command line on grub and direct to boot a harddrive holding the iso?
[03:32] <trogdor> dga: yeah kde apps have lot of coupled subsystem processes, not good for performance. For music try exaile or songbird. There loads off other apps though too if you search synaptic
[03:32] <zetheroo> can someone help me get the splash screen working again???
[03:33] <IntuitiveNipple> ixian_: It sounds as if the PC didn't get an IP address allocated by the router using DHCP. Have you checked that yet (ifconfig) ?
[03:33] <trogdor> zetheroo: which splash screen?
[03:33] <theacolyte> Has ANYONE gotten apache/php working in 7.10 yet?
[03:33] <mark_> GBenemy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NUbuntu
=== karioka is now known as amexpal
[03:33] <ToddEDM> hey how can i change some settings in the default  windows aniumation
[03:33] <chill> is it possible to get gnome 2.20 in feisty?
[03:33] <corevette> my splash screen doesn't work
[03:33] <addicted68098> Does the new ubuntu version have a way to save files on a partition that is going to be overwritten durring instalation, I thought I saw something about the other day, but I can't seem to find it
[03:33] <biggahed> hello there. Im trying gutsy amd64. Is there any 'it sucks huge amounts of ram' issue known?
[03:33] <facugaich> flick: if you already have the .deb package you can install it with "sudo dpkg -i <package-path>"
[03:33] <TokenBad> ok in ubuntu a friend installed but his nic card isn't detected...anyone know how to fix?
[03:33] <zetheroo> trogdor: when you login there is a Ubuntu splash .... its not happening since I upgraded
[03:33] <GBenemy> thanks mark_
[03:34] <ixian_> IntuitiveNipple: should i just paste the output of ifconfig?
[03:34] <corevette> zetheroo, same here
[03:34] <zetheroo> trogdor: also the log-off sound is not happening
[03:34] <thedukeny> How can i make it possible to get my monitor to change to 1650 x 1280?
[03:34] <NemesisD> does anybody know if i can perform some sort of repair installation of a messed up upgrade to gutsy with the gutsy cd?
[03:34] <gonk23> ixian_: right click the network connections icon in the top-right corner and select Connection Information.  Tell us what the IP address and subnet mask is.
[03:34] <slaytanic> corevette, zetheroo, same thing here.
[03:34] <zetheroo> corevette: have you worked out why?
[03:34] <trogdor> zetheroo: there are settings for such...
[03:34] <thedukeny> Its not giving me that option
[03:34] <corevette> zetheroo, not yet
[03:34] <funkyb> dunky - i struggled to get 1280x800 for days
[03:34] <funkyb> it was the EDID not getting detected
[03:34] <zetheroo> trogdor: well thats the thing.... all the settings are set correctly
[03:35] <funkyb> setting the xserver config utility manually to 1280x800 (and NOTHING ELSE!) worked for me
[03:35] <IntuitiveNipple> ixian_: No... run the command in a terminal, and look for the "inet addr" - it should be in your router's range (192.168.x.y)
[03:35] <ixian_> gonk23: my ip address is 192.168.1.103
[03:35] <trogdor> zetheroo: personally I think the splash is kinda useless since your either don't care what its doing or your watching the screen seeing the systems steps as it boots.
[03:35] <Akaishi> is there any way I could download some kind of boot image and install it to a hard drive partition, then boot that and install the rest over internet?
[03:35] <slaytanic> corevette/zetheroo: It works on the livecd? Mine does on the livecd, just not after install.
[03:35] <corevette> same slaytanic
[03:35] <element> hello
[03:35] <mpeters> are there any dangers in upgrading from ubuntu gutsy RC to final?
[03:35] <ixian_> gonk23: which shouldnt be cause i set it to 192.168.1.5 in the network config
[03:35] <jvon> if i do an install of gutsy on an already partition drive with dapper will it format the drive?
[03:35] <Gooie> Hey can I have some help for a first time linux user? I want to know how to make the mouse be faster? I put the scroll bar all the way up for acceleration, and its still really slow!
[03:35] <mpeters> I imagine not, but it never hurts to hear the experiences of others
[03:35] <zetheroo> trogdor: well that may be true.. but nevertheless its a fault...
[03:35] <trogdor> zetheroo: don't use the main list of settings use the tab settings its hidden in that long list
[03:36] <element> my ipod isn't auto mounting
[03:36] <keycool> I'm sorry I'm very new...can somebody help me get my WPA working on my wireless card?
[03:36] <funkyb> akaishi:  maybe this? -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35087&page=40
[03:36] <gonk23> ixian_: your IP address looks OK in either case -- what's the subnet mask, 255.255.255.0 ?
[03:36] <trogdor> zetheroo: on the menu not the window I mean
[03:36] <funkyb> (flip to pg 1, sorry)
[03:36] <ToddEDM> i would like to change the settings on Compiz.... how would i do that ???
[03:36] <element> in fact none of my USB works unless I plug in in before i turn the computer on
[03:36] <ixian_> gonk23: yes
[03:36] <flick> how do i create new items in the Applications menu?
[03:36] <zetheroo> trogdor: tab?
[03:36] <mark_> keycool: don't ask to ask, just ask.
[03:36] <element> and now the ipod won't even mount if I put it in before i turn the computer on
[03:36] <funkyb> ToddEDM, you need to install the compiz settings manager
[03:36] <funkyb> it adds those features to your preferences menu
[03:36] <ToddEDM> thank you funky
[03:36] <funkyb> np
[03:37] <funkyb> sry i don't know the package name oiffhadn
[03:37] <funkyb> offhand^^
[03:37] <TokenBad> friend has a 3com etherfast nic card and installed ubuntu edgy...and it didn't detect his nic card so he has no inet...is there a way to fix it?
[03:37] <trogdor> zetheroo: its kinda hard for me to explain, I use xubuntu. Oh and there is something about the splash thing in menu.lst use locate command to find it, updatedb if it finds nothing
[03:37] <funkyb> ndiswrapper maybe?
[03:37] <element> my ipod isn't auto mounting
[03:37] <element> how do i fix it?
[03:37] <oxeimon> element: your mom isn't auto-mounting
[03:38] <zetheroo> trogdor: what do I look for?
[03:38] <IntuitiveNipple> ToddEDM: It should be there as System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
[03:38] <funkyb> I had to identify my card using lspci or lsusb (forget which), then get the XP drivers from Dell, then use ndiswrapper to get the card working
[03:38] <mark_> element: Are you using rhythmbox?
[03:38] <funkyb> Intuit, that packages is not shipped with gusty is it:?
[03:38] <oxeimon> element: jkjk :-D :-D :-D
[03:38] <trogdor> zetheroo: ctrl +f splash
[03:38] <funkyb> I had to install ut manuallyt
[03:38] <element> i just want to use it as a hard drive
[03:38] <Akaishi> this doesn't seem like quite what I'm looking for
[03:38] <zetheroo> trogdor: isn't it called something different than "splash" in linux?
[03:38] <oxeimon> does anyone here have an amd64 system with an ATI-graphics card
[03:39] <trogdor> zetheroo: not really... do you want it to be?
[03:39] <VousDeux> I think that Xubuntu VM will make a pretty good hack environment...I think I'll keep it :)
[03:39] <keycool> I have a Cisco Aironet Wireless 802.11b card for my t40 thinkpad, I cant get WPA networking to come up on my join network menu
[03:39] <zetheroo> trogdor: ha
[03:39] <funkyb> I started w/ amd64, ran into problems and flipped to 32 bit and everything worked much easier.
[03:39] <gonk23> ixiam_: I assume the "default route" on the connection information screen said 192.168.1.1 ?
[03:39] <mark_> element: Have you tried this? http://ipodlinux.org/Mounting_on_Linux
[03:39] <keycool> any thoughts?
[03:39] <Akaishi> my issue is that my CD drive has a questionable IDE cable that causes data errors when I try to install from it. It's good enough to run the liveCD but I need to install to hard drive via network and I don't have another machine
[03:39] <addicted68098> The ipod is reconized as an external harddrive and not just an ipod right?
[03:39] <joanki> on ubuntu domcumentation, it says:  Ubuntu can read and write files on your Windows partition.
[03:39] <joanki> Is this a good idea?
[03:39] <element> i have rockbox on my ipod
[03:39] <thedukeny_> is it possible to get my resultion back to 1650 x 1050 even tho i can't select it?
[03:39] <zado> has anyone else try installing an application with ADD/Remove only have it tell you that you have a conflicting package installed please romve it OR this application was not designed for i386?
[03:39] <zyxnull> keycool: i guess that card needs a firmware upgrade to get WPA
[03:39] <trogdor> funkyb: yeah no reason to use 64 bit unless you have huge loads off ram like 2gb+
[03:40] <thedefender> joanki | NTFS
[03:40] <funkyb> NTFS support is supposed to be safe now...i still worry a bit
[03:40] <thedefender> !NTFS | NTFS
[03:40] <joanki> so i should do it
[03:40] <ubotu> NTFS: ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[03:40] <joanki> because that way i don't have to switch back and forth if i want say, a document
[03:40] <up365> ToddEDM, take alook here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusion?highlight=%28composite%29%7C%28manager%29
[03:40] <keycool> zyxnull, how do I do that?
[03:40] <thedefender> lol
[03:40] <mark_> keycool: This page doesn't mention WPA support for your card: http://live.gnome.org/NetworkManagerHardware
[03:40] <zyxnull> joanki: YES! it works great, been using it for a while (with 7.04 + automatix) and works great!
[03:40] <funkyb> anyone know of a cool app launcher bar?  I haven't found one i like yet... at least not a supported one...
[03:41] <joanki> is 7.1 safe
[03:41] <axisys> how do I get the 3d effect shows here on the right second image  http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/ ?
[03:41] <joanki> i'm woried to do this
[03:41] <keycool> mark_, does that mean there isn't?
[03:41] <mark_> keycool: It may still be possible some other way.... avoiding NetworkManager and using ndiswrapper, but depending on your situation, getting a more compatible card may be simpler.
[03:41] <thedefender> funkyb: try AWN
[03:41] <IntuitiveNipple> Akaishi: There is a neat way of solving that alot of the time - take the cable off, put each of the connectors in a vice, and squeeze it carefully but hard. It usually improves the electrical connections and solves the issues when the cable has been strained for whatever reason
[03:41] <geoff_> how do i enable desktop effects on a fresh xubuntu gutsy install?
[03:41] <diizy_> Hi All, where can i get assistance for audio programs?
[03:41] <zyxnull> keycool: Ok, let me check i used to have that old device somewhere near
[03:41] <axisys> i am on ccsm but dont see that
[03:41] <thedefender> !effects | geoff
[03:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about effects - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[03:41] <funkyb> i'm on a lappy so getting a more compatable card was less desirable
[03:41] <thedefender> !compizfusion | Geoff
[03:41] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about compizfusion - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[03:41] <thedefender> dammit
[03:41] <Akaishi> nah, the cable is 40 conductor, it needs to be 80. I've got a replacement cable being shipped but I'm impatient :D
[03:41] <funkyb> ndiswrapper was easy to do
[03:41] <ali110> i just installed kubuntu 7.10 and after installation it offered me to install my ATI property drive ( which i really wanted to install) after installation i restarted my computer for it to take effect but once ubuntu starts my monitor shows that it is out of sing, as a result i couldnt log onto kubuntu at all currently i am using my windows , what should i do
[03:42] <thedefender> geoff: go to system\ preferences\ apperence
[03:42] <Ryuho> sup scroll
[03:42] <IntuitiveNipple> Akaishi: well the 40-core cable should just limit the max ATA rate, it ought not cause data loss
[03:42] <phed> Hi
[03:42] <thedefender> geoff: go to effects and enable them to as you wish, if you want more compex effects
[03:42] <geoff_> thedefender, im using Xubuntu not gnome.
[03:42] <speaker219_> Quick question. In ubuntu 7.10, is ndiswrapper installed?
[03:42] <phed> Why can't I open this file in Ubuntu?  http://dump.no/files/0a6877132597/Mortimer_Twang-MOONMAST.MOD
[03:42] <thedefender> i see
[03:42] <axisys> ali110: copy your previous xorg.conf.<ext> to xorg.conf and restart
[03:42] <funkyb> speaker, no
[03:43] <mark_> speaker219_:  You can check yourself in synaptic.
[03:43] <Akaishi> well if it's not the cable it's the motherboard and I'm trying very hard to believe it's not the motherboard
[03:43] <funkyb> at least it wasn't when I used the beta
[03:43] <zetheroo> ok... I am installing the splash-manager from synaptic... we'll see how that goes....
[03:43] <ali110> axisys: how to do that ( iam a noob in linux )
[03:43] <funkyb> who made the board akaishi?
[03:43] <thedefender> hmmm, not sure if Xubuntu has effects, seeing is it is suppose to be a lighter system
[03:43] <siriusnova> man
[03:44] <Akaishi> it's an abit VA-10
[03:44] <siriusnova> it kind of sucks that there is no filesystem compatability between macs and linux
[03:44] <siriusnova> :|
[03:44] <ali110> axisys: i can run kubuntu in command line mode , then from where should i copy the files and to where
[03:44] <trogdor> thedefender: effects can be installed to any system
[03:44] <funkyb> abit makes damn good boards, i'm hoping it's not the board with you :-)
[03:44] <darkcrab> there isnt?
[03:44] <siriusnova> i cant use ext3 for my external hd on my mac
[03:44] <axisys> ali110: cd /etc/X11
[03:44] <element> when i run   cat /proc/scsi/scsi   my ipod only shows as a toshiba hard drive
[03:44] <element> not an ipod
[03:44] <element> lol
[03:44] <axisys> ls -lart xorg.conf*
[03:44] <siriusnova> the ext2fsx driver crashes
[03:44] <darkcrab> but I thoguth mac was ext3
[03:44] <axisys> look at the date
[03:44] <siriusnova> no macs are hfs+
[03:44] <cafuego> or ufs
[03:45] <thedefender> trogdor: yes but is it already preinstalled on Xubuntu
[03:45] <darkcrab> my mac is formated in ext3
[03:45] <diizy_> anyone know how I can get ardour to install as it will not allow me through add/remove for some reason?
[03:45] <cafuego> or hfs, or hfs+journaling
[03:45] <siriusnova> UFS is bad under linux isnt it?
[03:45] <funkyb> wutz mac?  (lol)
[03:45] <keycool> zyxnull, any luck?
[03:45] <axisys> the one before the xorg.conf was the last good one
[03:45] <cafuego> darkcrab: Not under OSX it isn't.
[03:45] <darkcrab> that is what it said when I formated it
[03:45] <trogdor> thedefender: where you buying xubuntu preinstalled from?...
[03:45] <phed> hi?
[03:45] <ali110> axisys: thanks i will try but this will make the ATI driver stop working i think , if it is so what is the correct way to install my ATI driver
[03:45] <siriusnova> Basically I have an external HD which I need to use with Linux and a Mac box
[03:45] <axisys> ali110: so just copy that last good one to xorg.conf
[03:45] <siriusnova> I cant use ext3, i cant use hfs+ because in Linux it's read only
[03:45] <phed> Why can't I open this file in Ubuntu?  http://dump.no/files/0a6877132597/Mortimer_Twang-MOONMAST.MOD  -- This is an amiga module file, but I can't figure out how to play it in totem
[03:45] <siriusnova> :|
[03:45] <ali110> axisys: thanks i will try but this will make the ATI driver stop working i think , if it is so what is the correct way to install my ATI driver
[03:46] <VousDeux> If I have a virtual machine that is fullscreen on desktop 2, how can I switch back to desktop 1?
[03:46] <axisys> ali110: well that will give your window manager back atleast
[03:46] <cafuego> hfs+ cna be mounted read-write in Linux, but you'll need to recompile the HFS module for it.
[03:46] <trogdor> thedefender: if you want effects just apt-get install compiz-fusion. it works on every setup however kde is bloated on its own built in effects system so running both might be lacking on performance
[03:46] <Madpilot> VousDeux, Ctrl+Alt+Left Arrow|Right Arrow
[03:46] <zar> ctrl + alt + left key will move to desktop 1
[03:46] <ali110> axisys: yes thanks very much
[03:46] <axisys> ali110: then u have to find a wiki and follow steps on how to conf your ati
[03:46] <ali110> axisys: thanks very much
[03:46] <thedefender> trogdor: huh buying? a man on here is wondering if he has effects on his Xubuntu gutsy installation and how to enable them
[03:46] <mbone> in 7.10, the auto-update of Firefox is disabled. how can I update it to latest version ?
[03:46] <VousDeux> Madpilot: thanks, I'll give it a shot :)
[03:46] <siriusnova> cafuego - dang it :|
[03:47] <funkyb> anyone know if compiz works on tri mon desktops?  I love this on the lappy but have only seen compiz demo'd on duals, never three (= 2 vid cards)
[03:47] <Cryoniq> phew.. now I can start compiz at least with the radeon open source drivers. But things are.. veeeeery slow moving windows or rotating cube..
[03:47] <zar> use synaptic to update
[03:47] <zar> firefox
[03:47] <chill> hello
[03:47] <funkyb> if it works i'll move the desktop over in a jiffy
[03:47] <siriusnova> how is UFS support under Linux?
[03:47] <leonel> anyone with  qemu gutsy  host  and  gutsy guest  ?   stoped working after gutsy upgrade  worked fine with feisty host
[03:47] <mbone> nothing there :)
[03:47] <element> hai
[03:47] <chill> can i upgrade to gnome 2.2 from feisty?
[03:47] <thedefender> trogdor: in gutsy gnome it compizfusion is preinstalled but i am unsure on xbuntu
[03:47] <trogdor> thedefender: you mentioned preinstalled, you installed the system yourself though right?  just open synaptic and grab a few fancy graphics things
[03:47] <TokenBad> friend has a 3com etherfast nic card and installed ubuntu edgy...and it didn't detect his nic card so he has no inet...is there a way to fix it?
[03:47] <element> my ipod isn't auto mounting
[03:47] <zyxnull> hey keycool, check the private!
[03:47] <axisys> Cryoniq: have u installed ccsm ?
[03:47] <trogdor> thedefender: its like what 10mb to install compizfusion or other things?..
[03:48] <diizy_> anyone know how I can get ardour to install as it will not allow me through add/remove for some reason?
[03:48] <IntuitiveNipple> leonel: I use QEMU/KVM without a problem
[03:48] <zetheroo> does anyone know where the Ubuntu splash screen sits?
[03:48] <keycool> i am
[03:48] <Cryoniq> axisys: hmm not what I know of...... what is that?
[03:48] <VousDeux> Madpilot: bummer...that didn't work. I have VMware. That may be different.
[03:48] <Pakl> When I try to install Ubuntu Server 7.10 under Parallels (build 3188) I get "Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted."  Any way around this problem?
[03:48] <Madpilot> VousDeux, that key combo is the standard Gnome one, Vmware probably overrides it somehow
[03:48] <keycool> zyxnull, im in private
[03:48] <silent> asdf
[03:49] <trogdor> thedefender: hmm there is one thing you would need to know. to use it you have to do compiz --replace command you can set xubuntu to do that upon start under settings
[03:49] <Pakl> (Clearly the CD-ROM was originally mounted because it loaded the installation program... so why can't it "mount" it?)
[03:49] <VousDeux> Madpilot: oh, I'm using KDE too :/
[03:49] <leonel> IntuitiveNipple: https://launchpad.net/bugs/126046    same  errors over here ..
[03:49] <element> my ipod isn't auto mounting
[03:49] <element> anyone know how to fix it
[03:49] <Madpilot> VousDeux, try #kubuntu?
[03:49] <VousDeux> Madpilot: thanks again :)
[03:50] <Cryoniq> Anyone know anything about slow gnome and compiz using the radeon open source drivers for example ati radeon 9800 pro under gutsy?
[03:50] <Akaishi> I base my cable theory on the fact that accessing the other IDE channel works without a hitch and that one uses an 80
[03:50] <keycool> zyxnull, I am talking in private, can you not see it?
[03:50] <mbone> is 7.10 keeps Firefox 2.0.0.6 and wait until Firefox 3 releases ?
[03:50] <IntuitiveNipple> Pakl: That sounds like something that used to occur with the Alternate CD install.. check this bug #143958
[03:50] <zyxnull> keycool: Nop
[03:51] <Pakl> IntuitiveNipple:  Thank you I will check it.
[03:51] <guest_student> Hi, I have clone a scsi hard drive to a non-scsi hard drive, but the cloned non-scsi hd still think that its a scsi drive, and it's really slow since DMA isn't turn on.

[03:52] <diizy_> anyone know how I can get ardour to install as it will not allow me through add/remove for some reason? the selection box is grey.
[03:52] <oxeimon> when I try to enable "extra" under visual effects, I get: "The copmosite extension if not available". What does that mean/what do I do?
[03:52] <wastrel> what's ardour
[03:52] <racarter> it says my network card driver is a restricted driver if that helps
[03:52] <IntuitiveNipple> leonel: There's a known issue with QEMU and the gfxboot atm, I'm trying to find the bug-report but there is a work-around for some  scenarios I seem to recall: bug #140713

[03:54] <bnovc> i installd it through snyaptic but it didnt really install so i tried the tar
[03:54] <IntuitiveNipple> Dialntone: Kino
[03:54] <zetheroo> for all those wanting a splash screen when booting into Ubuntu.... it seems that it was purposely removed from the Gutsy release because it was slowing down the boot-up process....

[03:55] <trogdor> zetheroo: if you liked it though it might become an option later on I hear they are transitioning the boot up mechanism to init-ng from sysv

[03:55] <youknowme> heh, I'm still running 32bit, think I should go 64 while I still can? Fresh install..
[03:55] <Dialntone> cinelerra

[03:55] <darkcrab> yup youknowme
[03:55] <wastrel> T1m: how are you trying to install xchat?
[03:56] <trogdor> zetheroo: you could still add a splash and sound when logging on/off its all there just go to login thing under settings menu
[03:56] <zyxnull> keycool: however, i ended up buying a proxim 8470-WD from ebay wich is a LOT better
[03:56] <usser> so ubuntu==ubuntu+1 now?
[03:56] <T1m> wastrel: apt
[03:56] <T1m> usser: yes
[03:56] <youknowme> darkcrab, really? I thought software support was the pits?
[03:56] <IntuitiveNipple> youknowme: Yes, it is very stable and doesn't have the drawbacks of having to run a 32-bit chroot for most apps now. I've been running 64-bit Gutsy for several months without any problems
[03:56] <trogdor> usser: yes
[03:56] <ToHellWithGA> in order to install gstreamer plugins developed for debian i need libwavpack0 4.31 but gutsy has libwavpack1 4.41.  How can i make the dependency happy?
[03:56] <darkcrab> for 64bit? oh, didnt know that.
[03:56] <BlaenkDenum> !repositories
[03:56] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[03:56] <ToHellWithGA> can i alias libwavpack0 to point to libwavpack1?
[03:56] <arooni_> folks !  i am running 7.04.. .when i try to upgrade to gutsy... it fails because it says: "could not find these 4 files/repositories"  what should i do?
[03:57] <trogdor> ToHellWithGA: why not use the gstreamer plugins in the ubuntu repository?...
[03:57] <oxeimon> when I try to enable "extra" under visual effects, I get: "The copmosite extension if not available". What does that mean/what do I do?
[03:57] <funkyb> thank you Intuit, I see why it was happening.
[03:57] <darkcrab> have you tried to switch server arooni
[03:57] <zetheroo> trogdor; ummmm..... I don't think so.... the log-in splash has not been included with Gutsy
[03:57] <ToHellWithGA> trogdor: because the debian-multimedia repository has bigger packages and i would assume that means more plugins
[03:57] <keycool> zyxnull, thanks so much
[03:57] <IntuitiveNipple> youknowme: I run Google Earth, Wine, and other big apps in 64-bit (GE needs some coaxing to get its installer to run but after that, it runs fine)
[03:57] <org> with that output is my video card driver installed well? http://pastebin.com/m74e7f9dc - if so why It doesn't show me a nvidia screen before I login to my gnome like my fiesty did.???
[03:57] <trogdor> zetheroo: copy it from feisty or online with google image search
[03:58] <mannytu> has anyone upgraded to the new Ubuntu?
[03:58] <zetheroo> trogdor: there is no Splash Screen manager like in fiesty
[03:58] <ToHellWithGA> mannytu: yes, someone has
[03:58] <diizy_> mannytu,  i have
[03:58] <trogdor> ToHellWithGA: just just search gstreamer 10 in synaptic and grab all those not ending in -doc or -dbg :)
[03:58] <mannytu> did you have problem?
[03:58] <diizy_> none, but i did it off a fresh hd
[03:58] <ToHellWithGA> trogdor: it's a version conflict.  i know which packages i want but they need dependencies not available in gutsy due to naming conventions alone
[03:59]  * Rabiddog sighs its spammer friday in some channels
[03:59] <org> with that output is my video card driver installed well? http://pastebin.com/m74e7f9dc - if so why It doesn't show me a nvidia screen before I login to my gnome like my fiesty did.???
[03:59] <trogdor> zetheroo: did you see the splash screens they were going to use for gutsy though? they sucked horribly, like big eye sores
[03:59] <zetheroo> trogdor: no ... actually I did not see them..... where are they?
[03:59] <guest_student> anyone, I have a non-scsi drive (/dev/hda), cloned from a scsi source (/dev/sda), and the cloned non-scsi thinks that it's still a /dev/sda instead of /dev/hda. I'm getting problems with it, since It operates very slow (I think because it cannot enable DMA). Please help. How do I change /dev/sda device to /dev/hda?
[03:59] <trogdor> ToHellWithGA: perhaps if you mentioned what it is your trying to install that requires such older codecs?
[04:00] <T1m> Hey, I just installed Gutsy. I'm trying to install XChat and I'm getting an error about it needing at least tcl 8.4.5 and that it is not available.
[04:00] <youknowme> IntuitiveNipple, ok, I'm gonna start downloading the 64Bit version. Heh, my upgrade to 7.10 crashed for some reason, I'm not sure why, the screen went blank and had line skewed through it. I figure all was lost, I saved the HDD though and I'm using a different one. Hopefully I can get some of my media and stuff of it lol. Heck I even had a backup of my original system, but even after flashing the drive with that I still had problems to the 
[04:00] <phynix> has anyone tried out 7.10 on  the ubuntu dells
[04:00] <IdleOne> T1m: xchat is available as a package under xchat-common
[04:00] <T1m> IdleOne -- Thank you
[04:00] <alien18> how do i set it so all my running programs are shown at once, even if they are in a different workspace on my cube?
[04:00] <trogdor> zetheroo: eh don't feel like grabbing it off my other comp, sure you can find them some where. I really liked default one they had on dapper for ubuntu though.
[04:00] <mannytu> T1m: was it an update or fresh?
[04:01] <T1m> mannytu: fresh
[04:01] <stainer> I am on a dell 1501 with ubuntu
[04:01] <IdleOne> T1m: always search in Syanptic before compiling :)
[04:01] <darkcrab> i use xchat gnome
[04:01] <Shoopuf> I'm sitting here right now using the 7.10 Live CD ready to install. I've reached the "partitions" part and don't know what to do. I only have 1 hard disk, it is currently formatted as NTFS and it has Windows XP on it. I want to install Ubuntu now but don't want to erase the stuff on the old partition. Should I "Manual" partition or "Guided?"
[04:01] <ToHellWithGA> trogdor: gstreamer0.10-plugins-really-bad requires libwavpack0 >=4.31, gutsy has libwavpack1 4.41, the same library with a different name
[04:01] <IntuitiveNipple> youknowme: Clean install will probably help then, but I'd recommend also you create a separate /home paritition during installation to avoid issues with your documents and settings in the future... saves a *lot* of hassle
[04:01] <T1m> idleone -- i am in synaptic, i just thought i would need to get the regular xchat package too
[04:01] <TokenBad> friend has a 3com etherfast nic card and installed ubuntu edgy...and it didn't detect his nic card so he has no inet...is there a way to fix it?
[04:01] <phynix> just wondering since the latest CF updates blacklisted the 1420n
[04:01] <org> can somebody help me with my vga driver?
[04:01] <IdleOne> T1m: nope you dont
[04:02] <zyxnull> Shoopuf: That depends on you, if you're a beginner the do the guided
[04:02] <darkcrab> shoopuf guided
[04:02] <riotkittie> TokenBad: does the card not show at all? in lspci/lshw ?
[04:02] <Shoopuf> Sorry I disconnected...
[04:02] <T1m> thanks
[04:02] <zyxnull> TokenBad: What 3com nic, there are many of them
[04:02] <IntuitiveNipple> Shoopuf: I *think* Guided, but you can try it and if it isn't what you want you can always return to previous steps and change the options, before you go ahead and install
[04:02] <zyxnull> Shoopuf: That depends on you, if you're a beginner the do the guided
[04:02] <timewriter> hi
[04:03] <TokenBad> zyxnull, all he tells me is a 3com etherfast card
[04:03] <youknowme> IntuitiveNipple, Oh thats a good idea XD I'll check that out, thanks!
[04:03] <timewriter> is it possible to install beryl if i already have xgl-compiz on my Gutsy ?
[04:03] <Shoopuf> OK thanks guys I'll do guided, I just don't want to lose any of my old partition (although I backed up a significant amount of it.)
[04:03] <bmk789> is this channel and the #ubuntu on ubuntu's IRC the same?
[04:03] <riotkittie> why would you want to install beryl?
[04:03] <timewriter> for the mac os full mode
[04:03] <riotkittie> bmk789: uh huh
[04:03] <diizy_> anyone know how I can get ardour to install as it will not allow me through add/remove for some reason? the selection box is grey.
[04:03] <Prax> is there a ubuntu help channel anywhere?
[04:03] <timewriter> i want the dock
[04:03] <darkcrab> i havent repartitioned since breezy badger, but the rule of thumb used to be to alway repartition ahead of time and never trust the partition managers supplied with the disk
[04:03] <racarter> i need help with wireless networking on ubuntu
[04:03] <riotkittie> Prax: you're in it
[04:03] <zyxnull> TekenBad: Try to find out wich chip he's using, many 3com chips have become legacy and not supported anymore, specially on 2.6 kernels
[04:04] <Prax> great
[04:04] <Shoopuf> I wanna do like half the hard disk is NTSF with Windows XP (for games) and the other half is Ubuntu (for everything that isn't games)
[04:04] <IdleOne> T1m: in Termial type apt-cach policy tcl8.4 will show you the avalilable version
[04:04] <Prax> I am having alot of bad luck with ati and my monitor
[04:04] <IdleOne> T1m: in Termial type apt-cache policy tcl8.4 will show you the avalilable version
[04:04] <timewriter> or is there a mac osx theme for compiz ?
[04:04] <darkcrab> Partition Magic is usually your best option.
[04:04] <trogdor> ToHellWithGA: then try doing whatever it is you are with a force option
[04:04] <zyxnull> Shoopuf: First, do a BACKUP, it wont hurt if you do that in case you mess something
[04:04] <tux> how can i get 5.1 surround sound working in gutsy?
[04:04] <timewriter> dont use Norton stuff , they will ruin your hdd
[04:04] <racarter> can you use knoppix and qtparted to partition a windows/linux dual boot system?
[04:05] <IntuitiveNipple> ntfs-3g's ntfsresize does the job well - I've never had it go ga-ga :)
[04:05] <racarter> actually i did that and i can't boot into vista now
[04:05] <trogdor> tux: what is 5.1 surround sound?
[04:05] <IdleOne> !gparted | racarter
[04:05] <ubotu> racarter: GParted is is a !GUI partitioning program. Type « sudo apt-get install gparted » in a console to install it - A GParted "live" CD is available at http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[04:05] <Prax> anyone have some experince with ATI cards and oddly shapped monitors?
[04:05] <timewriter> i have ati card
[04:05] <darkcrab> but then again, back during breezy badger linux wasnt handling NTFS very well.
[04:05] <racarter> regardless i used qtparted on knoppix though
[04:05] <T1m> IdleOne: None is installed, and no candidate is available.
[04:05] <zyxnull> I too have a shitty ATI Radeon 9700 card

[04:06] <IdleOne> T1m: do you have universe and multiverse repos anabled
[04:06] <IdleOne> ?
[04:06] <Prax> the issue is ubuntu never saves my monitor settings at reboot
[04:06] <tux> trogdor: my mobo is capable of 5.1 surround sound and I have a 5.1 surround sound headset and i wanted all the speakers to work instead of just two and I was wondering how to accomplish it
[04:06] <timewriter> weird
[04:06] <Prax> it always reverts back to "standard" graphics
[04:06] <timewriter> did u installed the ati drivers ?
[04:06] <trogdor> Prax: try using dccprobe located in xresprobe package to get monitor specs, look up www.monitorworld.com to find out info about the monitor if you don't have it on hand.
[04:06] <org> with that output is my video card driver installed well? http://pastebin.com/m74e7f9dc - if so why It doesn't show me a nvidia screen before I login to my gnome like my fiesty did.??? help please
[04:06] <T1m> IdleOne: Yeah
[04:07] <trogdor> tux: umm well have you tried playing with the mixer app?
[04:07] <timewriter> lol the ati catalyst is crazy
[04:07] <eugo> how do i get the size of a directory in console?
[04:07] <IdleOne> T1m: weird because tcl8.4 is in main so it should show you

[04:07] <thedonvaughn> org: probably ahve it set to not show it in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:07] <thedonvaughn> org: it can be turned off

[04:08] <org> thedonvaughn,  ok nvidia splash is turned off, then how can I know that my nvidia driver is installed very well?

[04:08] <madraz1> Hi all, I am not able to add mp3 files to amarok, it says some media could not be loaded(not playable). Plz help me
[04:08] <trogdor> org: lsmod to see if the module is loaded? lshw to see if the hardware is claimed. glxinfo to see what your card can do
[04:08] <IdleOne> T1m: in any case you dont need to install it anymore but you can if you like.
[04:08] <timewriter> xgl-compiz is amazing
[04:08] <timewriter> never tested it before
[04:09] <T1m> IdleOne: thanks :)
[04:09] <zetheroo> well I got the splash screen working

[04:09] <IntuitiveNipple> org: If the Graphics Card driver shows as "nvidia" it is loaded and working
[04:09] <timewriter> and it runs bad :(
[04:09] <org> ok IntuitiveNipple in the graphic card tab it says i have "nvidia"
[04:09] <zeeeee> is there a utility that lets me run a program in a sandbox? eg, i just downloaded poweriso and need it to extract a daa file, but i don't trust it to be crapware-free. i know i can create a user and run it as that, but that's a hassle to do per app per run
[04:09] <mikeo2> i killed it and it wont restart now
[04:10] <mikeo2> was in the middle of upgrading packages
[04:10] <IdleOne> mikeo2: how long ago?
[04:10] <trogdor> tux: there are lots of volume levels and sound switching options. Its a science of its own using the sound mixing options, there also a lot of alternative sound daemons to use and special kernels options/modification for better sound quality
[04:10] <mikeo2> a while ago
[04:10] <timewriter> anyone has that osx dock ?
[04:10] <mikeo2> just killed it now
[04:10] <ToHellWithGA> trogdor: what i'd really like to do is alias libwavpack0 to libwavpack1 because they are clearly the same thing with a different name
[04:10] <IdleOne> mikeo2: what error you getting?
[04:10] <Dekkard> simdock?
[04:10] <mikeo2> no error

[04:10] <mikeo2> and i killed it with xkill after i got sick of waiting for it when it wasn't responding
[04:10] <Dekkard> getdeb has simdock
[04:10] <IntuitiveNipple> zeeeee:  You could do it in a virtual machine guest using QEMU
[04:11] <mikeo2> no error nothing happens
[04:11] <timewriter> i wish that SOMEONE tells me how to get it for compiz
[04:11] <tux> trogdor: oh boy. looks like more work than i intended lol
[04:11] <trogdor> ToHellWithGA: hmm you would have to figure out how apt lists what is installed or perhaps find the directories relevant to that codec and change it..
[04:11] <mikeo2> is there a command to run it from cli
[04:11] <IdleOne> mikeo2: sudo upgrade-manager -c
[04:12] <trogdor> tux: if you just want the sound working on extra speakers shouldn't be too hard, I like to listen to streamed music and stuff while gaming so its bit different

[04:12] <mikeo2> its ubuntu-server with kde and gnome installed on it by the way
[04:13] <zeeeee> any idea how hard it is to set up? it seems like i'd have to install an os into qemu, etc.
[04:13] <IntuitiveNipple> KeithWeisshar: Usually yes.
[04:13] <tux> trogdor: im used to that on windows and thats why I was trying to do it with linux lol
[04:13] <Casey> trogdor: winamp, windows media player, etc?
[04:13] <mikeo2> running kde on it right now
[04:13] <trogdor> zeeeee: virtual box man ;)
[04:13] <prakriti> what happened to the "expose" plugin for compiz-fusion?
[04:13] <IdleOne> mikeo2: try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and see what it sayd
[04:13] <Casey> trogdor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Media_Services
[04:13] <prakriti> Is it gone now in gutsy?
[04:13] <tomd123> Keithweisshar, I have a dual boot on the laptop right now, it works flawlessly and it even autodetected my vista partition and added automatically, talk about nice!!
[04:13] <riotkittie> prakriti: it's still there. do you have compizconfig-settings-manager installed?
[04:13] <d4rkmonkey> TROGDOR WAS A MAN.. no... he was a dragon man!!! well... maybe he was just a dragon.. but he was still TROGDORRRRRRRRRR!!! Burninating the country side, burninating the peasants, in their THATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!!!  THATCHED ROOF COTTAGES!!!!!!
[04:14] <d4rkmonkey> alright, I'm done...
[04:14] <zeeeee> trogdor, looking
[04:14] <IntuitiveNipple> zeeeee: that's it... using qemu-launcher (an apt-get install) you'll get a nice GUI dialog front-end. With that you can quickly mount the ISO installer CD image as a CD, and boot the QEMU guest from it, install, and off you go
[04:14] <mikeo2> ahhh
[04:14] <wastrel> you shouldn't have started
[04:14] <mikeo2> told me to run dpkg --configure -a

[04:15] <mikeo2> by the way... whats with the shit wallpaper?
[04:15] <trogdor> Casey: your looking for video or more so music?

[04:16] <mpeters> i'm still trying to find a solution
[04:16] <mikeo2> prakriti: it would look better than the current one
[04:16] <riotkittie> prakriti: should be in the "desktop" category in CCSM. second icon in the second row.
[04:16] <mpeters> you can run compiz and tell it to skip the checks
[04:16] <Pir8> Vlet,  did you have to modify lot of things in the config or was it just a snap ?
[04:17] <Vlet> Pir8: I'm not at the system now though, so I can't post my xorg, but all I had to do was add: option "Twinview" to my device section
[04:17] <c_plus_plus> mpeters: i haven't been able to find anything
[04:17] <biggahed> its not something like app x is using humungous amounts of ram. The system as a whole is
[04:17] <prakriti> riotkittie : thats expo, I was looking for expose.. the one where the windows all jump into view
[04:17] <Pir8> ok
[04:17] <Pir8> Vlet I shall give that a try, thanks mate.
[04:17] <mikeo2> i had a blacklisted pci on one box i installed it on, but if you disable the checks it works

[04:18] <zeeeee> ok, sounds like virtualbox is more advanced, and that qemu in the repos is actually the emulator, and not the latest virtualizer (qemu accelerator)
[04:18] <trogdor> Casey: you might be missing some codecs and therefor having problems, ubuntu uses gstreamer codec packages

[04:20] <oxeimon> does anyone here have an ATI graphics card with dual monitor setup?
[04:20] <astro76> biggahed, when ram is not being used in Linux, it is used as a disk cache to speed up your system, and is freed immediately when needed
[04:20] <fatbrain> Hello, I've had this problem some time now with different audio-cards, I use S/PDIF as audio-output, but the mic-input to my card doesn't get outputted on S/PDIF, is there any way to "fix" it so that my mic-input goes over the S/PDIF? (I'm using ALC883 audio-controller)
[04:20] <alien18> is there any way to move my entire ubuntu install to another hdd without losing any data/settings?
[04:20] <IdleOne> mrpyrover666: just state your issue
[04:20] <trogdor> Prax: sounds like a monitor problem. Fix your resolution in /etc/X11/xorg.conf check ddcprobe to see what your monitor supports
[04:20] <astro76> biggahed, so you see Linux handles memory much differently than Windows, and your system is fine ;)
[04:20] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: just ask your question, don't ask to ask your question
[04:20] <mu> Prax, I had a similar problem
[04:20] <mpeters> i didn't type that right c_plus_plus
[04:20] <mrpyrover666> well i dont know how to connect it to my laptop with ubuntu
[04:20] <IntuitiveNipple> avis: 16:9 and nvidia has always been detected fine in the installs I've done
[04:20] <mrpyrover666> how do i do it?
[04:20] <riotkittie> linux's memory handling <3
[04:20] <leonel> IntuitiveNipple: using  feisty's  qemu on  gutsy works fine ..
[04:20] <trogdor> Prax: and set your refresh rates, helps some maybe turn color settings from 24 to 16
[04:20] <c_plus_plus> mpeters: mine says "NVIDIA_MEMORY="65536" # 64MB"
[04:21] <Prax> my monitor isn't listed in the list of options and non of the "Genric" ones are sticking
[04:21] <avis> thanks IntuitiveNipple.  it failed for me with feisty i'm hoping it'll work in gutsy.
[04:21] <mrpyrover666> ?
[04:21] <Prax> I have found the refreash rate on amazon I just need to know which file to plug the numbers into
[04:21] <trogdor> Prax: you can put whatever you like in that quotation as a reminder of which monitor brand it is, not really important
[04:21] <mpeters> hmm
[04:21] <joanki> if i want ubuntu to read my windows NTFS partition, do i FIRST install ubuntu and THEN download the NTFS 3G driver? or another order?
[04:21] <IntuitiveNipple> avis: Gutsy has got a lot better thanks to newer Xorg and Gnome
[04:21] <mpeters> drat
[04:22] <wastrel> joanki: supposively gusty has ntfs3g by default
[04:22] <joanki> oh wow
[04:22] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Usually Gutsy will install ntfs-3g
[04:22] <riotkittie> wastrel: it does
[04:22] <jrgp> I just upgraded to gutsy. My sound is all sticky now. What can I do?
[04:22] <mpeters> c_plus_plus:  as a test, try running SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz
[04:22] <trogdor> Prax: /etc/X11/xorg.conf try reading here to see how to put it in http://www.x.org/archive/X11R6.8.0/doc/xorg.conf.5.html use ctrl F to search down the page
[04:22] <wastrel> i dunno, not having any ntfs drives
[04:22] <wastrel> ntfs is stupid
[04:22] <mpeters> just to get some eyecandy and test it out
[04:22] <mrpyrover666> !ask
[04:22] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:22] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: the package you want is called tilp2
[04:22] <mrpyrover666> How do i connect my Ti84 with ubuntu?
[04:22] <mrpyrover666> tilp2
[04:23] <mrpyrover666> hmm
[04:23] <mrpyrover666> I also have another problem
[04:23] <biggahed> astro76, im not a just converted linux user. Been using it for 6-7 years by now, so i know some of the diferences. But ive used some other amd64 bits distros and none of them ever used such a huge amount of ram for nothing.
[04:23] <trogdor> jrgp: lick it? lol I'd just download the gutsy cd and install then move my files over from back up
[04:23] <jrgp> How can I totally eliminate sticky noises from rhythmbox?
[04:23] <racarter> is ntfs-config supposed to be able to mount something?
[04:23] <c_plus_plus> mpeters: sorry i don't understand what you are asking me to do
[04:23] <mrpyrover666> Im having problems updating
[04:23] <tarvid> any wireless wizards around?
[04:23] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: most people in here are :)
[04:23] <trogdor> jrgp: well if this has been an ongoing problem and not a bug
[04:23] <Optimus55> hey. how can i tell what version of nvidia drivers i'm running and how to upgrade to the latest version?
[04:23] <jrgp> meh, that would be extremely annoying as I have like 100 gigs of stuff
[04:23] <darkcrab> anybody but me here use wubi?
[04:24] <Casey> <trogdor> Casey: you might be missing some codecs and therefor having problems, ubuntu uses gstreamer codec packages
[04:24] <trogdor> jrgp: perhaps try changing some alsa options or the frequence its running at
[04:24] <jrgp> well, there is no static in amarok
[04:24] <Casey> it doesn't have to do anything with codecs
[04:24] <Vlet> !anyone | darkcrab
[04:24] <ubotu> darkcrab: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:24] <trogdor> Casey: yeah?
[04:24] <mrpyrover666> vlet can i send u my error in private chat?
[04:24] <joanki> that's amazing you can run the operating system from the cd!
[04:24] <jrgp> where can I access the also stuff and the frequence?
[04:24] <Oni-Dracula> I'm having a problem sharing folders to a windows machine using Samba... I would like to either set up a username/password for my windows box to log in with or completely disable the need to use a user/pass.  Unfortunately the use of "smbpasswd" yields an error resulting in no pass being created
[04:24] <tarvid> i have a workaround for ath0 problems on gutsy but I don't have the faintest idea where to fix it
[04:24] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: no
[04:24] <mrpyrover666> oh
[04:24] <mrpyrover666> ok
[04:24] <trogdor> Casey: I know I type so sexy don't I ^^
[04:24] <navets> can somebody help me, I cannot remove virtual box. It keeps giving me errors
[04:24] <mrpyrover666> well its really weird
[04:24] <joeb3_> tarvid: where's the workaround?
[04:24] <Optimus55> hey anyone knows how to check which version of nvidia drivers im currently running?
[04:25] <Casey> trogdor: its a type of connection, not a type of format
[04:25] <c_plus_plus> mpeters: did you want me to put SKIPCHECKS=YES in the compiz file?
[04:25] <mrpyrover666> what should I do then?
[04:25] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: would solving the smbpasswd issue be the best solution?
[04:25] <astro76> biggahed, well you shouldn't take offense as it's a very common new user question... but if it's used as cache it's not being used for nothing, and you have to consider used-cached as the true amount of used ram
[04:25] <tarvid> joeb3_, ifdown ath0, ifup ath0
[04:25] <darkcrab> ok sorry, is it ok to use wubi to install ubuntu and use it indefinitely?
[04:25] <alcaponage> Can anyone help me with Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon? I can't update my graphics card!
[04:25] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: well, there are A LOT of people in here, and there's a good chance that I won't know the answer to your question, but someone else might
[04:25] <mpeters> nah
[04:25] <mikeo2> anyone here get SElinux configured properly?
[04:25] <navets> can somebody tell me how to remove virtual box
[04:25] <trogdor> casey: just saying if your missing the codecs for streaming stuff might be a problem
[04:25] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, if it's the shortest method of allowing my ubuntu shares to be accessed by my windows machine - yes
[04:25] <mpeters> c_plus_plus: rather, try changing that value from 65535 to 32768
[04:25] <navets> I keep getting this error : 2:30pm-7:00pm
[04:25] <mpeters> and save
[04:25] <mpeters> then try running compiz again
[04:25] <Casey> trogdor: well its not
[04:25] <marcosoria81> im also having problems with my graphics card in gutsy gibbon
[04:25] <mrpyrover666> I mean mine is really random the error is sooo long
[04:25] <c_plus_plus> uh... ok
[04:25] <navets> There was an error committing changes. There was possibly a problem downloading some packages, or else the commit would break packages.
[04:25] <tarvid> joeb3_, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/153376
[04:25] <AndyC1> im trying to mount a networked machine using sshfs, but I get this error: fuse: failed to exec fusermount: Permission denied
[04:26] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: I agree :) How are you running smbpasswd, and what is the error?
[04:26] <SirGlacious> navets:  sudo apt-get remove virtualbox
[04:26] <DanMulvey> i finally got my hdd to partition properly!!
[04:26] <marcosoria81> how can i run compiz on gutsy???
[04:26] <Vlet> mrpyrover666: then use pastebin to post it and paste the link to it here
[04:26] <navets> SirGlacious: tried, it doesn't work
[04:26] <Vlet> !paste | mrpyrover666
[04:26] <ubotu> mrpyrover666: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[04:26] <biggahed> astro76, none taken :) im just puzzled by this weird behavior. For me at least. I dont see the i386 version caching so agressively
[04:26] <trogdor> navets: search for it in synaptic right click and choose completely remove. You might still see it trying to close off virtual box on shutdown because it wasn't removed but worry not because it was, if it showed up on ps then it wasn't.
[04:26] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, lol I think i just figured out - I'm not using sudo and I'm getting "Could not connect to machine 127.0.0.1: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"
[04:26] <alcaponage> How do I update my Nvidia driver? I tried in the Restricted Driver Manager but it won't work
[04:26] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: oh duh :p
[04:26] <fatbrain> Any idea how I can install ALSA 1.0.15?
[04:26] <trogdor> navets: oh and click apply too
[04:26] <c_plus_plus> mpeters: restarting x
[04:26] <jrgp> @ marcosoria81: got to system -> preferences -> appearence
[04:26] <org> hello
[04:26] <matthew_> uhh, gutsy has so many issues.  used to be that all I had to do was insert in my SD card and a nautilus window would pop up.  Not any more.  now it's not mounted at all!  thanks gutsy!
[04:26] <rellik_> if I have gnome-terminal running in fullscreen, and I have another window in front of that, I sometimes lose the top window (gnome-terminal comes to the front when I click on the top window's title bar to move it, for instance)
[04:27] <navets> trogdor: I tried that, that is where I get the error message
[04:27] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, your nipple is truly intuitive
[04:27] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: :p
[04:27] <logyati> hello
[04:27] <org> i can't get my 6 & 7 button mouse to work right, I tried everything from tutorials and sites that I googl'ed none has working, but they worked for me in fiesty, can somebody help me please.
[04:27] <trogdor> navets: error message with what?
[04:27] <joanki> ok so i am trying to instal 7.1 but instead it is coming up with loading the operating system from the cd
[04:27] <mikeo2> org check to see if your old configs got overwritten
[04:27] <joanki> how do i actually INSTALL it
[04:27] <navets> trogdor: Synamptic, the message pops up saying: There was an error committing changes. There was possibly a problem downloading some packages, or else the commit would break packages.
[04:27] <Optimus55> how do i get compiz fusion icon?
[04:27] <jrgp> gutsy is so new that bugs are bound to happen. in a month most of these problems might be solved due to patches and updates. have patience
[04:27] <c_plus_plus> mpeters: that didn't help
[04:27] <oxeimon> when I try to enable "extra" under visual effects, I get: "The copmosite extension if not available". What does that mean/what do I do?
[04:27] <logyati> im using feisty... i just found out that the network icon disappeared from the gnome bar... that one that let me choose wired or wireless network
[04:28] <mu> It there a maximum resolution for a inspiron 1521 15"?
[04:28] <astro76> biggahed, on i386 Feisty, I have 2026 total, 1961 used, 65 free, but 1489 is cached
[04:28] <logyati> how can i put it back there?
[04:28] <org> mikeo2, old configs? No what i've edited is there in my xorg.conf now
[04:28] <org> didn't work though
[04:28] <mrpyrover666> here it is
[04:28] <oxeimon> is anyone here using an ATI graphics card on a dual monitor setup?
[04:28] <mrpyrover666> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41266/plain/
[04:28] <mikeo2> is it a logitech mouse?
[04:28] <wastrel> logyati: make sure the notification area applet is in your panel
[04:28] <alcaponage> When I try to update my Nvidia Graphics Card Driver, it says "The software source for the package 'nvidia-glx-new' is not enabled"
[04:28] <trogdor> navets: perhaps you should consult their website then... or download sources and view the readme section for uninstall
[04:28] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If using the LiveCD Desktop CD, let it boot from the CD. Once it has booted, there's an "Install" icon on the desktop. Dbl-click that, and it'll start the installer wizard
[04:28] <logyati> yes it is, i can see xchat and pidgin icon
[04:28] <navets> trogdor: k
[04:28] <trogdor> navets: its been a while since I used that stuff
[04:28] <joanki> wow
[04:28] <joanki> this is pretty amazing
[04:28] <joanki> i've never used linux before
[04:29] <joanki> and this is cooler than a mac!
[04:29] <Vlet> oxeimon: I did until I got sick of not being able to use compiz, and bought an nvidia ;)
[04:29] <org> mikeo2, yep.
[04:29] <c_plus_plus> MPETERS: that didn't help
[04:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: don't speak too soon :p
[04:29] <darkcrab> nothing is cooller than my mac
[04:29] <joanki> why, intuitive?
[04:29] <mu> oxeimon, yes I didi
[04:29] <mikeo2> cause when i upgraded my hardware in fiesty all my dual monitors and mouse buttons broke cause xorg got reconfigured, but i just restored the relevant parts of the old version and it worked again
=== TheDreamer is now known as Youri
[04:29] <bluebanana> in system/admin/screens and graphics/, my monitors are not in the list. What should I do? I have 2 monitors
[04:29] <logyati> wastrel, so?
[04:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: 'pride before the fall' and all that :)
[04:29] <Jordan_U> I am upgrading to Gutsy with update-manager, I have apt-listbugs installed, I keep getting the prompt "Are you sure you want to install/upgrade the above packages?[N/?/...] " no matter how may times I say 'y'
[04:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Or... 'tempting fate'
[04:29] <joanki> hmmmm you trying to hint something here about the system
[04:29] <bluebanana> My 2 monitors are 1) NEC MultiSync FP2141SB and 2) AOC 9Klr. Please advise
[04:29] <oxeimon> mu: how do you set up dual monitors?
[04:29] <biggahed> astro76, i was folowing the whole development of the i386 from tribe3. ive never seen it use more than 700mb of the 2gb i have in here(and thats with a firefox running for a long time). This is weird... anyways... lets see how things go in the next days
[04:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: No... but don't celebrate too prematurely :)
[04:29] <wastrel> logyati: i dunno , i don't use network manager.
[04:29] <mrpyrover666> Heres my update error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41266/plain/
[04:29] <blueeraser> anyone having problems acessing ntfs filesystems on gusty?
[04:29] <logyati> wastrel, i dont think that icon belongs to notification area
[04:30] <joanki> k
[04:30] <logyati> ok im gonna ask it again
[04:30] <org> mikeo2, can you help me
[04:30] <darkcrab> i love linux, but I still think OS X is better.
[04:30] <logyati> how to i put the network mnager icon back?
[04:30] <wastrel> i thought it used the notification area
[04:30] <wastrel> i hate osx , think linux is much bettert
[04:30] <mu> oxeimon, just a sec
[04:30] <joanki> ok but seriously
[04:30] <wastrel> so we cancel each other out
[04:30] <alcaponage>  When I try to update my Nvidia Graphics Card Driver, it says "The software source for the package 'nvidia-glx-new' is not enabled"
[04:30] <joanki> why is it that my selected city is nyc, and then it says the time is 4:30 pm?
[04:30] <darkcrab> hehe
[04:30] <IntuitiveNipple> logyati: back where? the nm-applet icon appears when NetworkManager is in use and available
[04:31] <astro76> biggahed, could this be an improvement then? ;) as far as I know taking advantage of unused ram as disk cache is desirable
=== saucisson_ is now known as saucisson
[04:31] <joanki> it says where are you?
[04:31] <logyati> IntuitiveNipple, im using this network manager... the icon just desappeared
[04:31] <astro76> biggahed, or am I missing something?
[04:31] <trogdor> joanki: mac is also unix based but not open source so less perks and restricted to mac hardware. http://www.taimila.com/?q=node/11 and http://www.winehq.org/ you might find interesting
[04:31] <joanki> it says New York, which i am
[04:31] <mrpyrover666> What the hell is a dynamic mmap
[04:31] <joanki> but then it sets my time way off
[04:31] <Vlet> bluebanana: do you have an nvidia card?
[04:31] <joanki> by 7 hours
[04:31] <mu> oxeimon,  aticonfig --initial=dual-head
[04:31] <c_plus_plus> mpeters?
[04:31] <alcaponage> Vlet:  When I try to update my Nvidia Graphics Card Driver, it says "The software source for the package 'nvidia-glx-new' is not enabled"
[04:31] <joanki> n
[04:31] <joanki> m
[04:31] <darkcrab> there is a lot of open source software written for the mac
[04:32] <wastrel> yeah but you have to run it on mac os
[04:32] <biggahed> astro76, i dunno... im thinking some lib compiles got screwed somehow
[04:32] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: That is probably because your system's hardware time is set to NY time, not UTC as is expected. When you set the timezone it offsets the hardware time according to the timezone you're in
[04:32] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, That doesn't change the fact that with a mac your OS is mostly proprietary
[04:32] <Vlet> alcaponage: in your software sources control panel, make sure you have universe and multiverse enabled
[04:32] <darkcrab> thats true
[04:32] <joanki> thx
[04:32] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, Or rather, with a mac running OS X ;)
[04:32] <arang2> guys i did an update to gutsy so far so good but im still using metacity how do i enable compiz? i thought it came by default?
[04:32] <mrpyrover666> Is any1 else getting Dynamic Mmap error when trying to upgrade?
[04:32] <darkcrab> there is no point in running linux on a mac anymore.
[04:33] <darkcrab> well, a ppc mac that is
[04:33] <IntuitiveNipple> logyati: Do you see nm-applet listed doing "ps -ef | grep nm-applet" ?
[04:33] <Jordan_U> arang2, What GFX card do you have?
[04:33] <marcosoria81> @grjp, i need to enable the accelerated graphic driver, but here is where im having trouble, i have an geforce4 mx 400 and havent been able to load the driver, i also tried with an ati 9800pro without success
[04:33] <rellik_> if I have gnome-terminal running in fullscreen, and I have another window in front of that, I sometimes lose the top window (gnome-terminal comes to the front when I click on the top window's title bar to move it, for instance)
[04:33] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, Why do you say that?
[04:33] <org> mikeo2, should i remove this? Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"true"
[04:33] <alcaponage> Vlet: Ic, can I enable all of them or just universe and multiverse?
[04:33] <matthew_> uhh, gutsy has so many issues.  used to be that all I had to do was insert in my SD card and a nautilus window would pop up.  Not any more.  now it's not mounted at all!  thanks gutsy!
[04:33] <arang2> Jordan_U: im running Nvidia 6600 with nvidia closed drivers 100.14.19 installed by gutsy
[04:33] <darkcrab> all ppc linux versions are slowly dieing out even yellow dog.
[04:33] <darkcrab> theres no support.
[04:33] <mikeo2> org not sure running xp right now
[04:34] <mikeo2> upgrading my server tho
[04:34] <wastrel> org: if you have a 800,000 button mouse, you probably don't need that
[04:34] <org> :(
[04:34] <cin> on firefox, when i change a page with a flash video that is playing, or close the tab, sometimes firefox crashes. is this a known problem?
[04:34] <org> wastrel, I need 7
[04:34] <Vlet> alcaponage: yeah, restricted too...  yeah, all of em
[04:34] <org> wastrel, I use my 6 and 7 button...
[04:34] <Oni-Dracula> ok still having problems with samba:  I've added a password using smbpasswd (this time giving it root), but my windows box is getting an invalid username/password error.  I'm using the username that's on here (ubuntu gutsy) and the password set up by smbpasswd
[04:34] <mrpyrover666> damn gutsy
[04:34] <wastrel> i meant you proably dont need "emulate 3 butons " true
[04:34] <Jordan_U> arang2, Try turning it on in System -> Preferences -> Appearance
[04:34] <d4rkmonkey> cin I think so, it happens to me too, and I've heard other people complain about it
[04:34] <alcaponage> Vlet: thanks
[04:34] <mikeo2> there are some great programs to bind the extra buttons
[04:34] <wastrel> org ^^^
[04:34] <Jordan_U> I am upgrading to Gutsy with update-manager, I have apt-listbugs installed, I keep getting the prompt "Are you sure you want to install/upgrade the above packages?[N/?/...] " no matter how may times I say 'y'
[04:34] <mikeo2> i use them to control xmms :)
[04:34] <cin> d4rkmonkey, ahh. are there threads on the ubuntuforums? i'll check it out
[04:34] <IntuitiveNipple> cin: If you're using the Adobe non-free flash player and plugin, there are sometimes unexpected results like that, but they seem to come and go.
[04:34] <org> wastrel, I don't understand it. what is the emulate 3 buttons?
[04:34] <Madpilot> Anyone else use the Muine music player and find it crashes every time in Gutsy?
[04:34] <arang2> Jordan_U: roger on that
[04:35] <joanki> im stuck again - it asks how do i want to partition the disk?  guided and it only says new partition size is 55% at 19.2 GB, but i reserved 37 GB in drive d: for this... how do i know if it is getting the right partition?  it doesn't say drive d?
[04:35] <c_plus_plus> hello. Im trying to enable compiz in gusy, but when i click on efects and X restarts, after loging back in, effects are still disabled
[04:35] <d4rkmonkey> cin I'm not sure if there are threads anywhere... sorry, theres probably a bug about it already
[04:35] <wastrel> org: it's for people with 2 button mice, so they click both buttons for 'middle click'
[04:35] <cin> d4rkmonkey, ah, oki
[04:35] <cin> IntuitiveNipple, i'm not sure which kind of flash i'm using. i'll find out
[04:35] <wastrel> org: because the traditional x/unix mouse had 3 buttons
[04:35] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus, what  graphics card d you have?
[04:35] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Do you have multiple drives?
[04:35] <org> wastrel, cool... thanks :)
[04:35] <darkcrab> i thought linux needed several partitions
[04:35]  * Jordan_U wonders if the devs missed a card in the blacklist
[04:35] <c_plus_plus> Geforce 6200
[04:35] <joanki> um
[04:36] <joanki> i have an intel core 2 duo processor t5600
[04:36] <Madpilot> darkcrab, it doesn't have to have, but it's better to have at least a couple of partitons
[04:36] <bnovc> this is amazing how difficult it is to install fonts in ubuntu
[04:36] <joanki> i dunno what that means
[04:36] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: I ask because you just said "drive d" which implies, in Windows terminology, a drive C too
[04:36] <bnovc> spent almost 3 hours on it
[04:36] <alcaponage> Vlet: When I reload, the downloading repositories failed.
[04:36] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: GeForce 6200
[04:36] <BUDD}{A> can someone help me with 7.10 i can't get moblock working
[04:36] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus has the restricted devices window popped up and installed the nvidia drivers for you?
[04:36] <joanki> yes i have a drive c
[04:36] <joanki> because i partitioned it already
[04:36] <joanki> i just put xp on drive c
[04:36] <Oni-Dracula> !samba
[04:36] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[04:36] <joanki> and i gave c half
[04:36] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: yes, my restricted drivers are installed and running
[04:36] <riotkittie> difficult? all i had to do was create a fonts dircetory in ~  and move fonts there
[04:36] <org> where do i find "desktop effects" I want to disable them
[04:36] <riotkittie> or was it .fonts <ponders>
[04:37] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Ok, so it sounds like you have one hard disk, but you're splitting it into partitions for Windows and Ubuntu?
[04:37] <oxeimon> I just opened up displayconfig-gtk and after changing properties for a second monitor and restarting, my primary monitor got completely messed up. How can I revert to old settings?
[04:37] <inigomontoya> org: System>Prefs>Appearance
[04:37] <joanki> yes
[04:37] <joanki> i want ubuntu to get drive d
[04:37] <riotkittie> org: system > preferences  ...  on gutsy in appearance
[04:37] <darkcrab> the ubuntu partitioner should ask you how much you want partitioned.
[04:37] <Madpilot> riotkittie, .fonts
[04:37] <org> thanks
[04:37] <trogdor> darkcrab: was there ever a reason for running linux on mac ppc?
[04:37] <darkcrab> not sure if it shrinks the xp partition or not
[04:37] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya?
[04:37] <joanki> what do i do now, intuitivenipple?
[04:38] <riotkittie> Madpilot: i should have known :o
[04:38] <Jordan_U> oxeimon, Look in /etc/X11/ and see if there is a backup of your old xorg.conf
[04:38] <darkcrab> if it was your only computer and you didnt want OS X trogdor.
[04:38] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: try this, hit alt+f2 and type "compiz --replace" without quotes
=== csc` is now known as csc_
[04:38] <cin> IntuitiveNipple, d4rkmonkey, i can't complain much; flash and media integration in web browsers seems to have really improved on ubuntu since last year
[04:38] <oxeimon> Jordan_U: What will it look like?
[04:38] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus, if it does nothing try it in a terminal and pastebin what spits out
[04:38] <marcosoria81> i have a geforce4 mx 400 and an ati radeon 9800 pro, i havent been able to congifure the acelerated driver for compiz, anyone can help me ???
[04:38] <vbabiy> How can i fix the Icon in the xchat-gnome package
[04:38] <Jordan_U> trogdor, I used to run it :)
[04:38] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: I already have, it restarts x, and when i log back in, no difference
[04:38] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: ok
[04:38] <ALice_en_REiCIel> halo...
[04:38] <trogdor> darkcrab: oh I thought there was a specific hardware reason to run linux on it
[04:39] <Jordan_U> oxeimon, It will start with "xorg.conf" and probably end in a date
[04:39] <darkcrab> not really, no
[04:39] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: To save confusion it helps not to use the Windows disk lettering language, since that doesn't apply to Linux at all. I'm guessing that right now you've got a physical disk drive (probably called /dev/sda) and it has one partition on it (/dev/sda1) containing Windows, and another partition (/dev/sda2 ?) that you're calling 'drive d'
[04:39] <darkcrab> more developer
[04:39] <the_darkside_986> hi everyone. i'm having trouble getting openGL apps to run in 640x480 resolution. higher resolutions work though. i turned off graphical desktop effects so i do not know what to do...
[04:39] <alcaponage> When I update my repository, the packages 'Translation en_CA' failed
[04:39] <alcaponage> Is that normal?
[04:39] <trogdor> Jordan_U: no wonder you such a noob :P lol kidding
[04:39] <Madpilot> OK, I can't stand rythymbox (too cluttered) and muine in gutsy crashes. someone recommend a nice simple album player that actually works in gutsy, please?
[04:39] <joanki> yes
[04:40] <oxeimon> Jordan_U: When I start up ubuntu, everything looks compeltely messed up...I can't even see anything clearly
[04:40] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, is "false" a valid option for "security = " in smb.conf ?
[04:40] <PokoTao> Anyone using Glade in 7.10?
[04:40] <wastrel> what's an album player
[04:40] <c_plus_plus> inigmatoya: i have no way of knowing what the output was since x imediately restarted.
[04:40] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If I'm correct then I'm guessing that the installer thinks it should resize /dev/sda2 by about 50% to save whatever is in there, and install Ubuntu in the remainder
[04:40] <d4rkmonkey> !ask | PokoTao
[04:40] <ubotu> PokoTao: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:40] <pwnt-> Cool, I got my mouse buttons to work! all of them :)
[04:40] <Jordan_U> oxeimon, Try starting in recovery mode or try pressing ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a terminal
=== psyphen_ is now known as psyphen
[04:40] <pwnt-> I'm org btw.
[04:40] <the_darkside_986> when i try to run a 3d app in 640x480 (the default for games like briquolo) i get only a black screen. i already ran nvidia-xconfig and x still works but it didn't fix the problem.
[04:40] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: I'm not entirely sure, it's a long time since I messed with that. You'd have to check the documents.
[04:40] <Madpilot> wastrel, well, a music player, but one that can play whole albums - can't stand the iPod Shuffle style of one-track-at-random.
[04:40] <cin> Madpilot, music? Amarok plays music collections... as does XMMS. XMMS is probably simplest; Amarok is like iTunes
[04:41] <trogdor> oxeimon: switch /etc/X11/xorg.conf driver to vesa if you need to work in graphical setting, you can use nano to edit from recovery mode
[04:41] <Sir_Sid> Is there a way to stop programs from using the system beep. Whenever i backspace to the end, pidgin and xfire do a system beep and thats very annoying.
[04:41] <funkyb> org got pwnt?
[04:41] <funkyb> :-)
[04:41] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: did you check your xorg log to see if it says anything about what happened?
[04:41] <darkcrab> the_darkside_986 do you have desktop effects enabled?
[04:41] <wastrel> Madpilot: xmms?  can't grip play as well as rip, that's nice & simple...
[04:41] <thedonvaughn> Madpilot: banshee.  Or just setup MPD
[04:41] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, I'm still having problems with samba - it's not accepting the username/password I'm giving it in winderz
[04:41] <wastrel> dunno i never listen to music
[04:41] <trogdor> oxeimon: I suggest you get direct rendering working for your card though to get better performance
[04:41] <the_darkside_986> darkcrab: i have disabled fancy desktop effects.
[04:41] <Jordan_U> Sir_Sid, rmmod pcspkr
[04:41] <riotkittie> use audacious over xmms
[04:41] <pwnt-> funkyb: yeah I guess so
[04:41] <oxeimon> Jordan_U: So I have xorg.conf, xorg.conf~, xorg.conf.1, xorg.conf.2...etc
[04:41] <avis> will my xorg.conf be different if i use the alternate cd instead of the desktop install cd ?   i'm thinking about using the alternatve 7.10 install cd since it will be finished first before testing if 1680x1050 will work in the desktop cd.  i was told the nvidia driver would support the 8500GT
[04:41] <oxeimon> trogdor: what's direct rendering?
[04:41] <funkyb> hehe, just joking around of course
[04:41] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: where is the xlog stored?
[04:41] <Sir_Sid> Jordan_U, whats that do exactly?
[04:41] <KeithWeisshar> how do i make vista the default grub option
[04:41] <oxeimon> trogdor: Everything was working fine until I  messed with displayconfig-gtk
[04:41] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: check the local logs in /var/log/samba/ for clues
[04:41] <trogdor> oxeimon: 3d stuffs with fancy shading and etc
[04:42] <darkcrab> does your monitor support the resolution your running it in?
[04:42] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[04:42] <Jordan_U> Sir_Sid, It removes the driver that lets you send sound to your system beep hardware :)
[04:42] <oxeimon> trogdor: Yeah all that was working fine. I was just trying to get my dual-monitor setup working
[04:42] <Jordan_U> Sir_Sid, You need to use sudo BTW
[04:42] <oxeimon> Jordan_U: Which xorg do I want?
[04:42] <trogdor> oxeimon: did that app back up your xorg.conf file? perhaps its just a mater of renaming a few files
[04:42] <Sir_Sid> Jordan_U, Thanks. That beep has been driving me insane
[04:42] <Prax> whats different in the xorg.conf between a screen and a monitor?
[04:42] <PokoTao> ok, good point :). I'm trying to install Glade on 7.10, but Synaptic says glade-gnome requires glade-common >= 2.8. Unfortunately, Synaptic only has glade-common at 2.12.
[04:42] <Jordan_U> oxeimon, I don't know
[04:42] <thedonvaughn> KeithWeisshar: in /boot/grub/menu.lst there is a "default directive" "default <num>" where num is the number entry for Windows in grub.  Start with counting from 0, so the first entry is 0.
[04:42] <trogdor> oxeimon: if all else fails insert live cd and copy what settings it has
[04:43] <Jordan_U> trogdor, That is what I suggested, he has many alternate backups in /etc/X11 for some reason
[04:43] <oxeimon> trogdor: I have a lot of different xorg.conf's, the current(bad) one: xorg.conf, and then also xorg.conf~, xorg.conf.1, xorg.conf.2...etc
[04:43] <darkcrab> if not the_darkside_986 go into the config file for the game, set the resolution to your current resolution, and see if that helps
=== Ashfire is now known as Ashfire908
[04:43] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, funny that... all the logs are empty :)
[04:43] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: Is the smbd server actually running? :p
[04:43] <trogdor> oxeimon: good luck then
[04:43] <the_darkside_986> darkcrab: ok i guess i can try that but this never happened in gutsy. i was wanting to run sauerbraten in 640x480 for performance reasons but 800x600 is fine.
[04:44] <the_darkside_986> *i mean feisty and dapper
[04:44] <Jordan_U> oxeimon, Try any of them, since you havn't had any problems before they are likely all good, or just delete your current one and let X figure itself out on its own :)
[04:44] <Madpilot> gah... does anyone actually USE Rhythmbox? Goofy thing is far too complex for it's own good. Off to find something else - thanks for the suggestions, folks.
[04:44] <IntuitiveNipple> Oni-Dracula: " ps -ef | grep smbd" should show a couple of processes at least
[04:44] <mikeo2> is dapper still supported?
[04:44] <oxeimon> just curious, what's the command for restarting a computer from the terminal
[04:44] <Jordan_U> mikeo2, Yes
[04:44] <IntuitiveNipple> Madpilot: Yes, I use it
[04:44] <KeithWeisshar> is there a control panel to set the default os boot
[04:44] <thedonvaughn> oxeimon: shutdown -r now
[04:45] <darkcrab> the_darkside_986 have you reconfigured your driver while in gutsy?

[04:47] <Madpilot> IntuitiveNipple, gah. thanks. was afraid of that - this thing is too complicated for it's own good.
[04:47] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: You could cancel the installer right now, delete the /dev/sda2 (drive d) partition manually, then restart the installer so it uses all that space
[04:47] <Oni-Dracula> IntuitiveNipple, nevermind, its still not working... I'm an idiot
[04:47] <mikeo2> jordan_u is there a guide somewhere or something?
[04:47] <moDumass> JEFFmasterFlex, yeh ive killed it a few times, when it restarts thats what it does though

[04:47] <IntuitiveNipple> Madpilot: Yes, there are a few annoyances :)
[04:47] <darkcrab> the_darkside_986 a black screen means that there is something wrong with either your video settings, your game video settings, or your driver settings, so if you can't get it working, Im not sure what to say.

[04:55] <IntuitiveNipple> alain: Depends on which camera chipset, and whether it is driven using V4L or V4L2, and if it is a UVC camera, etc
[04:55] <darkcrab> you updated to the beta ubuntu
[04:55] <riotkittie> the fact that you're having issues with it doesnt mean it's a bad os. it means _you_ are having issues with it.
[04:55] <alain> ubuntu: i did upgrade my box.. things went good for me
[04:55] <the_darkside_986> of course, i've had many problems with ubuntu release but since i didn't volunteer for testing it i can't really complain...
[04:55] <iobelisk> in the kernel line in menu.lst, if i wanted to add "vga=791" what kind of syntax would i use to add that to the existing kernel line?

[04:56] <Jordan_U> darkcrab, Ahh, didn't see him say that
[04:56] <times1> jordan:  i've looked at it,  it times out
[04:56] <ubuntu> darkscrab after 18 the full release was out

[04:56] <Ashfire908> ubuntu, so you went to 7.04 to the 7.10 release, via...?
[04:56] <IntuitiveNipple> alain: You'll need to do some Googling for the correct drivers for the camera. First step is to identify the chipset ID using lspci or lsusb
[04:56] <ubuntu> man,update it from the update manager
[04:56] <nrdb> arghh2d2, there are some instructions for booting of an iso image on the net, but they don't use grub for the bootloader.

[04:56] <darkcrab> i remember you complaining about installing the beta like a week ago ubuntu
[04:56] <yellow_chicken> anyone have sound driver problem in gutsty as there was for feisty?
[04:56] <times1> vlet:  how do i change the mirror?  is it possible to upgrade from ISO or do i need to do it from the update manager?

[05:10] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: As for the swap-space, to be honest I can't remember what the installer does in guided mode but it should create a swap partition :)
[05:10] <orlando> Jordan_U: I tryied with Debian..
[05:10] <joanki> nothok
[05:10] <asbani> rickjones: edgy? Why not gutsy? Interesting
[05:10] <kingnothing> rickjones: why are you installing edgy?
[05:10] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I see two screens, each called "Screen1", and I can't make one a secondary screen either
[05:10] <Talcite> rickjones: I'd double check the install
[05:10] <rickjones> asbani, the last 3 gutsy cd's i've burned do NOT boot the computer at all, so , i'll go edgy and upgrade.
[05:10] <Vlet> Shoopuf: hit ctrl-f2 and then type: sudo apt-get update
[05:10] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If you select Guided again, it should offer to use the entire unused space on that hard drive as you originally expected
[05:10] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: One of the screens is always disabled...
[05:10] <Ashfire908> rickjones, did you try thr alternate cd?
[05:10] <Talcite> rickjones: lspci is a very low level command, it interacts with the kernel
[05:11] <rickjones> is it downloadable ?
[05:11] <joanki> ok
[05:11] <Talcite> rickjones: yeah, it is downloadable
[05:11] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: in your Xorg.conf, comment out these lines NvAGP, DisableGLXRootClipping
[05:11] <Vegancheesesteak> hi all.  i cant seem to get flash to install in gutsy...anyone else having probs?
[05:11] <slvmchn> is there a site where i can see the benefits of ubuntu/debian on a dual-core processor?
[05:11] <Ashfire908> rickjones, no we keep it under gurad :P
[05:11] <Aishiko> rickjones, you might wnat to tell people who your talking to otherwise they may miss it.
[05:11] <rickjones> nice
[05:11] <c_plus_plu1> inigomontoya: ok...
[05:11] <rickjones> all i want it to support my nic and video card like it does the HP machine sitting next to it
[05:12] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: another thing, all the options should be in the device section not the screen section
[05:12] <Shoopuf> Vlet: Thanks.
[05:12] <rickjones> Talcite : where is this alt. cd ?
[05:12] <Vlet> Shoopuf: :)
[05:12] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: if you set one screen to defualt it should automatically set the other to secondary. Check where it says Graphics Card, and make sure it has your Graphics card selected. Also on which ever screen is disabled click on model in the Screen tab. Then find the model and manurfacture of the monitor
[05:12] <Shoopuf> What is the GNOME equivelant of Amarok called? I don't see it in Add/Remove.
[05:12] <Ashfire908> rickjones, it's the checkbox on the download page
[05:12] <Ryuho> how would i make a simple keyboard shortcut that brings up bash in terminal?
[05:12] <rickjones> k
[05:12] <inigomontoya> shoopuf: exaile
[05:12] <c_plus_plu1> inigomontoya: which options?
[05:12] <asbani> rickjones: don't do that mate. you have edgy, then fiesty, then gutsy. edgy is real old I think. not really good idea to upgrade from edgy > fiesty > gutsy! I've read somewhere that upgrading has bugs. I couldn't upgrade from gutsy beta to gutsy final. or even from fiesty to gutsy myself. see here too another people has same problem too. http://www.linux-noob.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=3262
[05:12] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: also make sure the monitor that says disabled it check to secondary and not disabled
[05:12] <Helmi> hey guys - i just activated visual effects in gutsy and i'm looking for the control panel to setup the effects in detail and can't find it :(
[05:13] <regulate> inigomontoya: there's also banshee
[05:13] <regulate> ooops
[05:13] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: move every line in the screen section that starts with Option to the device section
[05:13] <c_plus_plu1> inigomontoya: ok
[05:13] <regulate> Shoopuf: banshee (requires mono)
[05:13] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: if the manufacturer isn't listed, can I just use Generic?
[05:13] <rickjones> Talcite : this will detect and support my realtek nic ?
[05:13] <Vegancheesesteak> also what java should i install for eclipse?
[05:13] <inigomontoya> regulate: i had mono once
[05:13] <kingnothing> Helmi: you have to install compizconfig-settings-manager
[05:13] <regulate> inigomontoya: did a boy give it to you?
[05:13] <Talcite> rickjones: it's hard to say. Realtek NICs shouldn't have a problem.
[05:13] <dimas_> i had ov51x drver working good with camera in festy but now on gutsy the software does not reach the device
[05:13] <asbani> I'm trying to install DBI from cpan, and I keep getting errors. please help me with this. check my error here "http://pastebin.com/m2226801"
[05:14] <Helmi> kingnothing, thanks will try
[05:14] <Talcite> rickjones: they both use the same kernel though, so I would say probably not, but you don't have many other choices =P
[05:14] <c_plus_plu1> inigomontoya: testing...
[05:14] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: The "secondary screen" option is grayed out...
[05:14] <inigomontoya> regulate: no, but i know a girl didnt either ::grumble::
[05:14] <Vlet> Helmi: install compizconfig-settings-manager
[05:14] <Ashfire908> asbani, check the ubuntu forums
[05:14] <mechdave> asbani, do you have build essential installed?
[05:14] <Helmi> Vlet, thanks
[05:14] <astro76> Vegancheesesteak, eclipse works fine with java6
[05:14] <Talcite> rickjones: the fact that lspci doesn't output anything though indicates something is wrong
[05:14] <kingnothing> Helmi: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[05:14] <Vegancheesesteak> astro76: from multiverse?
[05:14] <Wolf23> guys how can i download or build from the sources libmp3lame?
[05:14] <asbani> mechdave: not sure about that. whats build essential?
[05:14] <Helmi> kingnothing, yeah i know thanks
[05:14] <kingnothing> okay :)
[05:14] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon i sent you a IM
[05:14] <astro76> Vegancheesesteak, yes
[05:14] <rickjones> Talcite : could it be the hardware isn't being detected due to some bios setting
[05:15] <Vegancheesesteak> astro76: thanks
[05:15] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I don't see your IM
[05:15] <Talcite> rickjones: yeah, but it should detect your chipset and everything else either way
[05:15] <asbani> Ashfire908: you got a link of a guy having same problem as mine?
[05:15] <rickjones> Talcite : will lspci work in 'live' user mode ?
[05:15] <Talcite> rickjones: but you're right, bios could play a role
[05:15] <Talcite> rickjones: 'live'? you mean livecd?
[05:15] <mechdave> asbani, build essential is the gcc compiler package for ubuntu. do apt-get install build-essential
[05:15] <joanki> IntuitiveNipple:  now there is only the guided - use entire disk option
[05:15] <joanki> is that what i want?
[05:15] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: hmm it should of poped up try sending me one
[05:15] <joanki> won't that overwrite my xp?
[05:15] <Ashfire908> asbani, no i mean use the search box :)
[05:15] <rickjones> Talcite : yes. livecd , sorry
[05:15] <allobjects> wirechief1, I have done your steps and only thing remaining after the dist-upgrade is that "digikam-doc" has been kept back
[05:15] <asbani> mechdave: righty
[05:16] <asbani> Ashfire908: Okay
[05:16] <mechdave> asbani, then see how you go
[05:16] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: bullet-proof x started
[05:16] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I just tried sending you one, didn't seem to work...
[05:16] <Talcite> rickjones: it should. once the kernel is loaded, there shouldn't be any problems with hardware-kernel interations
[05:16] <Wolf23> anyone help please?
[05:16] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: what's your aim sn?
[05:16] <dimas_> !ask
[05:16] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[05:16] <Ashfire908> asbani, you have build-essentail i think, cause the command make was found
[05:16] <asbani> mechdave: I just got a fresh gutsy install :)
[05:16] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: dun have aim have msn though
[05:16] <rickjones> Talcite : lspci outputs nothing
[05:16] <Talcite> rickjones: try resetting your bios to default settings, and also look online to see if other people have problems using the same mobo
[05:16] <Ryan52> I'm trying to set up keyboard shortcuts and they all work exect when I try "<super>c". If I change it to "<super>1" it works fine. What do I need to do to make this work. Also when I do the key combination "<super>c" my cursor moves to the middle of the screen.
[05:16] <asbani> Ashfire908: no I don't have build-essentail, i just did apt-get install build-essentail and its downloading as we speak
[05:17] <Talcite> rickjones: there's not much we can do... check the md5sum of your liveCDs as well
[05:17] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: can you just tell me in this chatroom?
[05:17] <rickjones> Talcite: fair enough. i'm downloading the alt cd now to burn
[05:17] <asbani> mechdave: whats also important things to install such as build-essentail for a new system? :)
[05:17] <scriptdevil> well.. it looks really stupid... but my mirror has got the gutsy release... but my update manager is not showing me upgrade-distribution
[05:17] <Talcite> rickjones: or use that option at the boot menu
[05:17] <scriptdevil> this is on xubuntu
[05:17] <mechdave> asbani, From experience in 7.04 Ubuntu does not install build essential as standard
[05:17] <joanki> can someone please help if they know how to properly install ubuntu into partitioned drive
[05:17] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: failsafe mode started?
[05:17] <rickjones> Talcite: option ?
[05:17] <nrdb> asbani, the manpages-dev package should help.
[05:17] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: yea seems like alot of txt though lol, but yea it should have your maker of monitor
[05:17] <kingnothing> does anyone know why PHP is no longer working on my install? I'm not sure what might have changed from 7.04 to 7.10 to do that...
[05:17] <Ashfire908> asbani, hmm, i assumed if you could use make you had that package
[05:17] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: yes
[05:17] <mechdave> asbani, Perl may have C/C++ modules in the code
[05:17] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: are you using LCD monitors?
[05:17] <Talcite> rickjones: I seem to remember an option at the boot menu to check the integrity of the cd
[05:18] <asbani> mechdave: oh ok
[05:18] <rickjones> oh
[05:18] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: copy your xorg.conf again, i'll make the corrections and send it back
[05:18] <asbani> nrdb: whats that
[05:18] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: yeah, one is Dell, one is Hanns-G
[05:18] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: ill put my xorg back the way it was.
[05:18] <Vlet> kingnothing: what happens when you run php at the commandline?
[05:18] <Ashfire908> kingnothing, double check your settings and stuff
[05:18] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: oh... ok
[05:18] <rickjones> Talcite: i go now to reset bios to default
[05:18] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I couldn't find Hanns-G under manufacturers
[05:18] <nrdb> asbani, the help for functions like printf etc.
[05:18] <Talcite> ok.
[05:18] <kingnothing> Vlet: as in, "php" at the command line? that does nothing
[05:18] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: should i just resend same pastebin url?\
[05:18] <inigomontoya> yeah
[05:18] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: ok let me check right quick sometimes they're diff, Do you know the model of the Hanns-G?
[05:18] <Ashfire908> kingnothing, /etc/php5 i think, and /etc/apache2/ (somewhere)
[05:18] <joanki> ok then if someone could please help me with this: Select Logical, Swap and set the size to double your system memory.
[05:19] <joanki> what is doulbe my system memory?
[05:19] <Wolf23>  helpers ? how can i download or build from the sources libmp3lame?
[05:19] <asbani> wow the apt-get just asked me to insert my gutsy gribbon cd then press enter. is that right?
[05:19] <scriptdevil> can anyone tell me why my update manager on fiesty is still not showing me "Upgrade distro"
[05:19] <Shoopuf> So I installed Exaile, then when I double click an MP3 within it the screen goes grey and it stops responding. :( Is that normal...
[05:19] <Ashfire908> Vlet, not everyone has the command line package
[05:19] <IanLiu> What are my options to edit videos on Ubuntu?
[05:19] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41270/
[05:19] <ademan> hey is it possible to un-chroot yourself?
[05:19] <kingnothing> Sorry, i'm terrible at PHP. I just use it for phpmyadmin as a front end to mysql
[05:19] <CyberMad> does anyone know how to join chatroom from yahoo messenger? there is no that feature on gaim :(
[05:19] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: the hanns-g monitor is JC199D
[05:19] <CyberMad> i usually use this feature on yahoo messenger (windows)
[05:19] <scriptdevil> CyberMad: there is.. room list
[05:19] <asbani> CyberMad: there is in pidgin I think.
[05:19] <joanki> it says set the size of swap to double your system memory.
[05:19] <mechdave> asbani, open a terminal and type sudo apt-get-install build-essential
[05:19] <joanki> how do i know what is my system's memory?
[05:20] <asbani> mechdave: I did. it asked me for gutsy CD
[05:20] <mechdave> supply your password when asked and it should do the rest
[05:20] <CyberMad> aahh thanks.. i will try install pidgin
[05:20] <joanki> please someone can you help me?
[05:20] <joanki> i been stuck here for an hour
[05:20] <joanki> please please please
[05:20] <Ashfire908> asbani, insert it and hit enter
[05:20] <scriptdevil> CyberMad: pidgin = gaim
[05:20] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: i'm doing a google on it, i work at a pc place so i can help out alot :)
[05:20] <asbani> mechdave: why does it ask me for CD when I try to apt-get every now and then. It's weird. never happened to me in fiesty
[05:20] <Dante124> Man oh Man...Just installed Gutsy....and it takes 3 minutes to boot....no ubuntu login screen until then either...what's up with that?
[05:20] <nrdb> mechdave, asbani, that would be 'sudo apt-get install build-essential' ?
[05:20] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: sweet thanks :-D :-D :-D
[05:20] <martyvis> joanki: just ask your q!
[05:20] <astro76> joanki, double ram doesn't necessarily apply to systems over 512 MB ram, that's an old guideline
[05:20] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: it should look like this, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41274/
[05:20] <Ashfire908> joanki, you don't know how much ram you have?
[05:21] <joanki> 1 gb
[05:21] <mechdave> nrdb, Uum yeah, thx :)
[05:21] <sharp> is there anything i can do (besides compiling picard) to get picard to work with mp3's??
[05:21] <joanki> so when i am creating swap,
[05:21] <asbani> nrdb: hmm
[05:21] <joanki> then what size do i make it?
[05:21] <asbani> I think it asks me for gutsy CD because I have to upgrade my sources.list or something?
[05:21] <scriptdevil> joanki: another 1 gig??
[05:21] <Vlet> Ashfire908: regardless of whether you have the php-cli, you can still run it from the cl
[05:21] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: the monitor is made by Hannspree, Inc.
[05:21] <slackern> asbani: System-Administration-Software Sources and then tick out the cdrom at the bottom there and it won't look for the cd/dvd any longer and only use online repos.
[05:22] <mechdave> Oops too many hyphens there!
[05:22] <joanki> but how can i set it to something i don't have?!
[05:22] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: how much memory does your PC have? usually you want about 150% of RAM to allow for hibernation, if you intend the PC to hibernate
[05:22] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: its a 19" LCD Flat Panel monitor :)
[05:22] <Dante124> Man oh Man...Just installed Gutsy....and it takes 3 minutes to boot....no ubuntu login screen until then either...what's up with that?
[05:22] <martyvis> joanki: you can probably get away with no swap with 1GB ram
[05:22] <asbani> slackern: cool thanks! should I change something in my online repos?
[05:22] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: yup I know. It's not under the manufacturers though
[05:22] <martyvis> joanki: however is your want to hibernate you will want 1GB plus a little bit
[05:22] <Ashfire908> jonaki, set the swap to about 1 to 2 gb
[05:22] <joanki> ok so it says create a new partition
[05:22] <mechdave> asbani, how did you go?
[05:22] <joanki> logical i chose
[05:22] <joanki> and it says new partition size in megabytes
[05:22] <Ryan52> I'm trying to set up keyboard shortcuts and they all work exect when I try "<super>c". If I change it to "<super>1" it works fine. What do I need to do to make this work. Also when I do the key combination "<super>c" my cursor moves to the middle of the screen.
[05:22] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: So, if the PC has 1GB of RAM, then a swap of 1.5GB is sufficient (for hibernation purposes)
[05:22] <joanki> what do i enter?
[05:22] <slackern> asbani: nah i don't think you need to, mine is working perfect as it is, it just seems to sort itself automaticlly for me :)
[05:23] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: restarting x...
[05:23] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: hmm try using generic then, you still be able to use it then
[05:23] <Ashfire908> joanki, yep, logical
[05:23] <joanki> um .... how many megabytes is 1.5 GB?
[05:23] <scriptdevil> can anyone temme if i need to change my repos in order to upgrade my distro??? i dont get the option of upgrading in update manager
[05:23] <martyvis> joanki: 1500
[05:23] <scriptdevil> joanki: 1500 rougly
[05:23] <Ashfire908> joanki, one 1GB is 1024 MB
[05:23] <astro76> joanki, 1536 ;)
[05:23] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: because when i did mine it showed one of my monitors as a Generic, and i had to go change the model and stuff
[05:23] <joanki> ok
[05:23] <joanki> so i should set it to 1536
[05:23] <joanki> even though this tutorial says to set it to double
[05:23] <astro76> probably way overkill
[05:23] <martyvis> joanki: the tutorial is wrong
[05:23] <ckw_> anyone here successfully running an ATI dual head video?
[05:23] <astro76> joanki, that's old advice, often still repeated
[05:24] <Shoopuf> The guided partition erased my NTSF partition. T_T
[05:24] <joanki> so 1.5 is fine
[05:24] <joanki> ok
[05:24] <joanki> gonna do it for 1536
[05:24] <Ashfire908> joanki, quit paincing, 1.5 is fine
[05:24] <martyvis> joanki: this applied when people had ram of 8MB (like my first linux machine in 1993)
[05:24] <jotil> 1GB is 1000MB, 1GiB is 1024MiB
[05:24] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: testing compiz now...
[05:24] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If the PC had 256MB of RAM then 200% is a good choice. For a PC with 1GB of RAM, then 150% is a better choice
[05:24] <joanki> THANK YOU
[05:24] <arang2> guys i read in the forum that in order to make vmware workstation to work again i need to run ./vmware-config.pl to reconfigure, i installed the linux headers and all ok till it tries to build the vmnet module and crashes cos its missing something any ideas?
[05:24] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: okay, I've got it as generic. I still can't click on "secondary screen" though
[05:24] <noor> you guys what button is "Super" for compiz-fusion ?!!!
[05:25] <grumbel> my mouse cursor looks wrong (as in not alpha-blended) on the log-in screen it however is properly alpha-blended, theming isn't the issue, since switching to a different cursor set doesn't fix anything. Anybody knows whats going on (ubuntu7.10, nvidia)?
[05:25] <scriptdevil> joanki: tutorial is a guideline, it is not binding.. a swap is used to temporarily store data that cant be stored on ram because of no memory.. the processor keeps swapping this... actually i dont remember the swap ever being used on my pc
[05:25] <noor> I dunno the "Super" Button for compiz-fusion
[05:25] <jotil> noor: the windows button
[05:25] <Vlet> arang2: what's it missing?
[05:25] <edward> I can't run .bin files anymore because "virus scanner" opens them, what program is suppost to open .bins ?
[05:25] <noor> jotil:TY
[05:25] <foug> how are the repo's doing?
[05:25] <IntuitiveNipple> arang2: Yes, there's an 'all' patch script, v 114 I think
[05:25] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: will it let you put it as default? and the other as secondary?
[05:25] <Vlet> noor: the 'windows' key
[05:25] <Ashfire908> noor: the windows button
[05:25] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: no more restarting x... but this time it said "Desktop effects could not be enabled"
[05:25] <joanki> ok also, where should the location of the new partition be - obviously at the END, not beginning, right?
[05:25] <scriptdevil> can anyone temme if i need to change my repos in order to upgrade my distro??? i dont get the option of upgrading in update manager
[05:25] <Ashfire908> joanki, swap at the end
[05:25] <arang2> IntuitiveNipple: where do i get the patch? pls link
[05:25] <DanMulvey> for some reason proprietary drivers don't want to install for me (im a noob) any advice on how to get them (nvidia and wireless card)
[05:25] <moDumasser> hey all
[05:25] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Beginning... it relates to the 'beginning' of free space
[05:25] <joanki> and use as?
[05:25] <joanki> ext3?
[05:25] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: nope, as soon as I make one default, the other one becomes disabled. There is never any secondary option
[05:26] <arang2> Vlet: i need to run it again to tell u the error
[05:26] <joanki> oh man two conflicting answers
[05:26] <joanki> one says end another says beginning
[05:26] <emanuel> Hey, have anyone here installed 7.10 in a Compaq F500 yet?
[05:26] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: do compiz --replace again
[05:26] <astro76> joanki, I'd put the swap first, closest to the middle
[05:26] <noor> SWEET it worked XD
[05:26] <moDumass> sorry my bad, im already here
[05:26] <joanki> ok
[05:26] <IntuitiveNipple> arang2: You'd need to Google for it, I used it a while ago now
[05:26] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: ok
[05:26] <jotil> joanki, doesn't matter. pick one.
[05:26] <astro76> Ashfire908, swap in the middle means less head thrashing, I've started using that ;)
[05:26] <Ashfire908> joanki, swap as swap. the root ( / ) as ext3
[05:26] <joanki> and also, use as? ext3, ext2, reiserfs, jfs, xfs, fat16, fat32, swap, efi
[05:26] <arang2> IntuitiveNipple: could u suggest me a few strings to google it easier?
[05:26] <joanki> i put swap in
[05:26] <joanki> ok
[05:26] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If it is the swap you are creating, then the type is swap :)
[05:26] <joanki> THANKJ YOU
[05:26] <moDumass> hey so i uninstalled ktorrent and installed deluge since google said its cooler in Gnome, and i started it up, now its gone
[05:26] <martyvis> astro76: but she aint gonna swap -
[05:27] <joanki> PHEW that part is done!
[05:27] <Ashfire908> astro better yet, another hard drive :D
[05:27] <joanki> now i must do the root
[05:27] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: and your using a ATI Radeon? hmm sounds like your video card has some Firmware or Software that lets you change it in its program
[05:27] <jisatsu> I changed the Qt theme with qtconfig, but when I start Filelight, it uses different colours. any idea how to change that?
[05:27] <mechdave> what was the X config tool again for the CLI 7.04?
[05:27] <astro76> martyvis, oh I know, I'd make the swap 512 max if not hibernating ;)
[05:27] <joanki> do i want a home partition?
[05:27] <scriptdevil> DanMulvey: well.. doesnt the restricted drivers option in system show them to you?
[05:27] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: have you tried reconfigureing the xserver?
[05:27] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: ahhh... you've gone the 'manual' not guided route have you?
=== Jannitax is now known as Jannita
[05:27] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: How do I do that, xrandr?
[05:27] <joanki> guided route was trying ot take over all 80 GBs
[05:27] <scriptdevil> joanki: it is recommended.. but you can have one huge / and forget the rest
[05:27] <foug> is the Xscreensaver that's in the Ubuntu repo's the same one in Debian's?
[05:27] <joanki> i coujldn't let it do that
[05:27] <edward> what program is suppost to open .bin files
[05:27] <edward> ?
[05:27] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: It is a good idea, yes...
[05:27] <joanki> ok
[05:27] <Ashfire908> joanki, you don't need a /home partition
[05:27] <DanMulvey> scriptdevil: I tried that, but it gives me an error saying they aren't installed when i try to enable them
[05:27] <moDumass> whats the easiest way to dload torrents in ubuntu?
[05:28] <scriptdevil> edward: it just runs ./filename.bin
[05:28] <george_> just create a swap and a / partition
[05:28] <Dialntone> that kino isn't very friendly.. :( doesn't even play .avi files...
[05:28] <george_> call it a day
[05:28] <mechdave> edward, Usually they are bash scripts
[05:28] <joanki> how big should home partition be?
[05:28] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41275/
[05:28] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: i'm not sure how you reconfigure the xserver in Gutsy, haven't used ubuntu but for a few weeks
[05:28] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: ... best thing is to create a root of about 10-12GB, and the rest as /home - it makes upgrading releases later a *lot* easier
[05:28] <scriptdevil> DanMulvey: well.. have a net connection
[05:28] <scriptdevil> ??
[05:28] <edward> "./file" doesn't work for me anymore
[05:28] <DanMulvey> yeah
[05:28] <Dialntone> Bad edward...
[05:28] <Dialntone> bad..
[05:28] <mechdave> edward, make sure it is executable
[05:28] <joanki> would it be ok if i set it to 16000MB for root and then the 20000 MB for home?
[05:28] <Ubuntu101> Interesting issue with compiz when installing ubuntu-desktop from Xubuntu 7.10. When attempting to change from "none" to "normal" it states the composite extension is not available. And now both the Application preferences window and the error message (stating that the composite extenseion is not there) will not close. (I have not tried killing the processes yet.
[05:28] <edward> it is, i've used it before
[05:28] <ademan> is it possible to un-chroot yourself?
[05:28] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: have you checked the restricted drivers manager?
[05:28] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: Another thing, when I go to the "Graphics Card" tab, I see two sections, "Graphics card(VESA driver (generic))", and under that I can change the driver
[05:29] <scriptdevil> DanMulvey: just click enabled.. it should download and install
[05:29] <edward> but now virus scanner won't let me run .bins anymore
[05:29] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: yeah I installed flgrx
[05:29] <Vlet> ademan: I think you can just 'exit' a chroot
[05:29] <DanMulvey> scriptdevil: thanks ill try again
[05:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: You'd never use 16GB for root (I develop Ubuntu kernel and I only have 12GB)
[05:29] <martyvis> joanki: sounds ok - just don't rip too many DVDs
[05:29] <astro76> joanki, it would be fine, except you might be able to have a bigger /home, don't forget all your user files go on /home
[05:29] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: *fglrx*
[05:29] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: what options does it give you in the Graphics card tab?
[05:29] <joanki> ohhhhh
[05:29] <kishan> !updates
[05:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about updates - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:29] <payan> Please help. aMsn window frame disapears with Compiz
[05:29] <ademan> Vlet: hrm, it's not really letting me do that
[05:29] <arang2> Vlet: i get this make[2]: *** [/tmp/vmware-config1/vmnet-only/userif.o] Error 1
[05:29] <kishan> does any one got updates today in gusty
[05:29] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: There are two places where I can choose the Driver
[05:29] <joanki> sorry to ask, but could someone tell me how many mb is 12 GB ?
[05:30] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: as an example, I have partitions for /boot (512MB), / (12GB), swap (2.5GB), /test (8GB), /home (the rest)
[05:30] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: i looked at xlog, and the driver seems to be vesa!
[05:30] <martyvis> joanki: ~1200
[05:30] <jotil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebibyte
[05:30] <Motyoj> ox, nope
[05:30] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: multiply by 1000
[05:30] <asbani> Thanks mechdave. what you told me did the job :)
[05:30] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: Each section is titled "Graphics card(VESA driver(generic))"
[05:30] <joanki> oh
[05:30] <joanki> oops
[05:30] <LOWER_CASE> Hi, How do I change NVIDIA video card drivers after replacing a blown card?  The install script says I should "init 3", but X is not shutdown. Some person, in his limited wisdom, changed how X-Windows gets disabled in Ubuntu so it's different from any other Linux distro?!? Help, please?
[05:30] <asbani> mechdave: now I got DBI installed perfectly thanks mate
[05:30] <joanki> ok so im gonna make root 12000 mb
[05:30] <joanki> and the rest home
[05:30] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: and I can select a driver for each one, should I say fglrx?
[05:30] <jotil> GB and GiB is not the same people
[05:30] <joanki> i don't need a test, right, intuitive?
[05:30] <martyvis> joanki: whoops ~12000
[05:30] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: oh, well no wonder, it's vesa now?! that makes no sense
[05:30] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Sounds good
[05:30] <mechdave> asbani, Fantastic, good to hear
[05:30] <edward> when I do ./planeshift.etc.bin I get "can not exececute binary file."
[05:30] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: i know.
[05:30] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: correct... I have /test because I build and install kernels
[05:31] <moDumass> i have no taskbar
[05:31] <joanki> INtuitive, i make it at the beginning? or end?  also use as is ext3 for root?
[05:31] <astro76> jotil, that's great except hardly anything uses those new units, including all the linux system tools
[05:31] <Ubuntu101> yes
[05:31] <mechdave> !config
[05:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about config - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:31] <Ubuntu101> Joanki, yes
[05:31] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Always choose 'beginning' and ext3, yes
[05:31] <Vlet> arang2: it was the first result on google when searching for that file name... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3558604
[05:31] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: ... on the other hand, the "restricted drivers manager" says that the driver is in use.
[05:31] <moDumass> !taskbar
[05:31] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about taskbar - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[05:31] <arang2> Vlet: thanks!
[05:31] <joanki> and what is the mount point, intuitive?
[05:31] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: the nvidia driver that is
[05:31] <kishan> does any one got updates today in gusty
[05:31] <Vlet> arang2: google google google :)
[05:31] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: yea if you can select the same driver for each try that
[05:31] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: 'Beginning' is relative to the freespace on the drive, not *all* the space on the drive
[05:31] <Ubuntu101> kishan, yes, just find a different mirror site ;)
[05:32] <joanki> got it intuitive
[05:32] <slyder> http://www.compiz-themes.org/content/show.php?content=62864&forumpage=1 can anyone tell me how to get my gnome panels to look like this?
[05:32] <IanLiu> What program should I install to edit videos??
[05:32] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: because both are plugged into your ATI card right?
[05:32] <joanki> do i need to enter a mount point, intuitive?
[05:32] <inigomontoya> c_plus_plus: at this point i would run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" to have xorg make a new xorg.conf
[05:32] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: For root "/" for home "/home"
[05:32] <dmandell> I've got a Compiz-related question.
[05:32] <asbani> I love the new gutsy, and i love you people
[05:32] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: yup
[05:32] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: ok
[05:32] <martyvis> IanLiu: home videos probably kino
[05:32] <jotil> astro76, don't hate. i was being dramatic. it's friday night. even for linux using human beings, who are recently human because they use ubuntu.
[05:32] <joanki> um intutive, that / option is not available
[05:32] <scriptdevil> kishan: me neither... i thing the indian mirror is not updating
[05:32] <Ubuntu101> dmandell: don't ask to ask ;)
[05:32] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I've changed both from "generic VESA-compliant card" to fglrx
[05:32] <joanki> i have ext3 ext2 reiserfs jfs xfs fat16 fat32 swap efi dont_use
[05:32] <dmandell> Ubuntu101: cool, thanks
[05:32] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: then it should pick both of them up.
[05:32] <kishan> Ubuntu101, i got 26 updates but not dowlpading
[05:32] <asbani> new packages?
[05:32] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: it should be (not using the quotes "..." of course)
[05:33] <Ubuntu101> kishan: yes, are you using synaptic?
[05:33] <mechdave> what was the X server config tool again for the command line in 7.04?
[05:33] <arang2> Vlet: i got the patch, where do i decompress it so i just recompile the thing or i must reinstall the whole vmware?
[05:33] <scriptdevil> joanki: ext2 for boot, ext3 for normal file systems, swap for swap
[05:33] <edward> why can't I execute a binary file?
[05:33] <Vlet> arang2: I don't know. read the instructions
[05:33] <dmandell> When I use the the GConf Configuration Backend in Compiz the "Bring to Front" preference doesn't work.
[05:33] <IntuitiveNipple> edward: Is the +x flag set?
[05:33] <edward> i dunno
[05:33] <martyvis> edward: it needs "x" permissions
[05:33] <asbani> was there any new updates since release in the "Update manager" ?
[05:33] <Yowsers> whats the best way to manage ubuntu remotely??? winvnc?
[05:33] <Ubuntu101> chmod 755 <filename>
[05:33] <joanki> ok, and it's not here
[05:33] <joanki> there is NO /
[05:33] <joanki> i PROMISE
[05:33] <Ubuntu101> in a terminal
[05:33] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: I think ill just put my xorg back the way had it before and call it a night
[05:33] <edward> i used su, still can't run it
[05:33] <Vlet> Yowsers: ssh :)
[05:34] <Yowsers> ah yes
[05:34] <jotil> mechdave, it was the same command you used in 6.10 or 6.04
[05:34] <Yowsers> why of course lol
[05:34] <MidnighToker> edward: `ls -lah` to check, `chmod +x <filename>`to set execute
[05:34] <slyder> http://www.compiz-themes.org/content/show.php?content=62864&forumpage=1 can anyone tell me how to get my gnome panels to look like this?
[05:34] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: I think you've got confused... the / is entered for the mount-point, not the file-system type
[05:34] <edward> okey
[05:34] <dmandell> When I use the "Flat File" backend the preference does work, but one of my custom keyboard mappings doesn't work.
[05:34] <joanki> ohhhhh
[05:34] <Yowsers> but with ssh, you dont get the gui?
[05:34] <mechdave> jotil, I know, but I use it so seldom I have forgotten!
[05:34] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I still can't select "secondary screen"
[05:34] <joanki> so use as  is ext3?
[05:34] <Blama> Hey all, does anyone know how to mount an NTFS partition using Gutsy?
[05:34] <Jordan_U> I am getting this error upgrading to Gutsy, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41272/ it doesn't go away no matter how many times I say yes, should I say no?
[05:34] <astro76> joanki, yes ext3
[05:34] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: For file-system ext3, for mount point /
[05:34] <asbani> My "/" partition isn't a ex3 according to kdiskfree!
[05:34] <martyvis> edward: you need explicitly set the path - if is the current directory you need to say ./theexecutable
[05:34] <joanki> ok phewwwwwwww this is STRESSFUL
[05:34] <craig22> so if i have a 750 gb hard drive with just mp3's on it is xfs the way to go?
[05:34] <asbani> which is confusing really
[05:34] <IntuitiveNipple> and for home, ext3 and /home
[05:34] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: hmm still mirroring the other
[05:34] <Vlet> mechdave: it just takes weening. after getting used to it, it's far more useful/powerful than a gui
[05:34] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: I did warn you :p
[05:34] <dmandell> So, any idea why changing configuration backends in compiz would make a keyboard shortcut change?
[05:35] <piecesandbits> Advise for filesystem encryption on Fiesty laptop?
[05:35] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: yup
[05:35] <Ubuntu101> (12:28:53 AM) Ubuntu101: Interesting issue with compiz when installing ubuntu-desktop from Xubuntu 7.10.

[05:35] <joanki> ok almost done here
[05:35] <Motyoj> my cat is quite finicky...
[05:35] <joanki> use as is what for home
[05:35] <Ubuntu101> errm oops
[05:35] <IntuitiveNipple> piecesandbits: use LUKS and cryptsetup
[05:35] <joanki> i know moint point for home is /home
[05:35] <Ubuntu101> anyone have a clue on that one?
[05:35] <joanki> but what about use as
[05:35] <edward> im going to reboot, ill *never* download "virus scanner" again, it hijacked all my files
[05:35] <c_plus_plus> inigomontoya: I think ill just put my xorg back the way had it before and call it a night
[05:35] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: the thing is, it doesn't even say "secondary screen - mirror mode"
[05:35] <Blama> Hey all, does anyone know how to mount an NTFS partition using Gutsy?
[05:35] <piecesandbits> IntuitiveNipple, cool!  Checking it out now
[05:36] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: even the mirror-mode option is grayed out
[05:36] <mechdave> Cmon guys, I hardly ever use it coz I hardly ever change my X settings, hence asking the question I did
[05:36] <mechdave> ask
[05:36] <mechdave> :)
[05:36] <DanMulvey> alright I am getting the error "The software source for the package is not enabled" when I try to install the proprietary drivers
[05:36] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Use As ? what are the options? I don't remember what the installer looks like
[05:36] <DanMulvey> I am connected online and I have the install cd in
[05:36] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: hmm sounds like your ATI has some software that is blocking out the Gutsy UI for your screens and graphics
[05:36] <Jordan_U> DanMulvey, Enable restricted in System -> Administration -> Software Sources

[05:36] <joanki> ext3

[05:37] <squib> hey guys, do you guys know what causes the phenomenon of Xorg loading with the menu bar icons loaded in the wrong places/order?
[05:37] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: i know nVidia had a similar program, i used to run a nVidia GeForce 2 400mx till i picked up my other monitor
[05:37] <heartsblood> me thinks i've been playing around in gconf-editor a bit too much.  how do I force a nautilus window to open up?

[05:37] <Blama> Hey all, does anyone know how to mount an NTFS partition using Gutsy?
[05:37] <joanki> phewwwwww
[05:37] <joanki> done!
[05:37] <Vlet> LOWER_CASE: that will turn off your gui
[05:37] <squib> I had to fix my xorg.conf file to get booted and everything is mostly fine except the networking and shutdown icons are transposed
[05:37] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Time for a cuppa :)
[05:37] <squib> obviously my 'fix' wasn't that great.
[05:37] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: do think I should try to install the drivers from the ati website?
[05:37] <LOWER_CASE> Vlet: much thanks. Alfredo
[05:38] <DanMulvey> jordan_u: should i enable all of these or just the one i need right now?
[05:38] <Jordan_U> heartsblood, have you tried running "nautilus" from a terminal?
[05:38] <joanki> not quite

[05:38] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Format?
[05:38] <Jordan_U> DanMulvey, All of them are usually enabled by default, don't know why they weren't for you
[05:38] <Vlet> LOWER_CASE: then, run the installer like: sudo /home/yourusername/Desktop/NVIDIA..... or whereever it is
[05:38] <unknown--> hey all
[05:38] <Blama> scriptdevil, how do I find out what the partition is?
[05:38] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If so, tick the format checkbox against the / and /home mounts

[05:40] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Eeeek! It sounds as is something has got confused somewhere. Which partition is it reporting that about?
[05:40] <heartsblood> Jordan_U: Check didn't return any errors and --browser just enters without a window coming up.
[05:40] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: might have to post a topic about it in the ubuntu forums, i'm running out of ideas lol
[05:40] <mboso> I added a windows partition info to my grub menu.lst file but every time it updates, it deletes that info. How can i make it stick?

[05:41] <Smegzor> help!  I have set up a shared folder but i'm always asked for a password when I try to connect from Windows.  Where do I set the password?
[05:41] <briantumor> quickly quickly
[05:41] <asbani> briantumor: yes, I think you can
[05:41] <unknown--> i'm thinking if i format and clean install it'd be better than upgrading..? isn't safe graphics mode the same as 'low res' mode?

[05:41] <sistom> Anyone?
[05:41] <squib> does anyone know how to direct the order of menu bar icons loaded with GNOME and hteir locations?
[05:41] <riotkittie> briantumor: you can go for an install without X, and it'll be fine
[05:41] <asbani> briantumor: why are you in a hurry or what
[05:41] <martyvis> briantumor: yes but you won't be able to do much - 128MB is probably bare min these days
[05:41] <squib> a change in my xorg.conf file has caused the icons to load all whacky
[05:41] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: yea you'll have to ask sum1 about how to execute it, i'm not sure
[05:41] <oam_> Hi all , i think i have found a bug with Nvidia 8600GT + restricted drivers + Gusty 7.10.... i need a hand to trouble shoot before i report it though..
[05:41] <briantumor> asbani, would fluxbox be sufficient
[05:42] <riotkittie> briantumor: you may be able to put something like fluxbox on
[05:42] <oam_> anyone got some time to try and help me ?
[05:42] <sistom> I am trying to watch a DVD-ROM on my laptop and when I put it in Totem Movie Player opens up and when it tries to play the movie I get an error saying, "An error occurred: Could not open location; You may not have permission to open the file."
[05:42] <briantumor> cool :)
[05:42] <scriptdevil> oam_: ask away
[05:42] <Ubuntu101> briantumor: I would suggest Xubuntu
[05:42] <jotil> mechdave, you it was: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg :P
[05:42] <asbani> briantumor: fluxbox is nice, It runs smooth. but never happen that I tried it in a 64 ram system
[05:42] <mechdave> jotil, yeah got it now... managed to remember after the 10th attempt
[05:42] <astro76> squib, that's not an X problem it's gnome, are you using Feisty?
[05:42] <Jaszbo> It will boot just fine if you reboot and choose "Install in safe graphics mode."
[05:42] <riotkittie> Ubuntu101: i think xfce is a bit heavy for 64mb
[05:42] <ice9__> I  can't run update-manager cause I don't have pygtk
[05:42] <oam_> ok ... basicly i upgraded from 7.04 .. but had problems .. just nuked it all and installed fresh from the 7.10 Desktop ISO ..
[05:42] <limecat> LVM is superior to normal partitioning, correct?  more features?
[05:42] <ice9__> i did install pygtk many times
[05:42] <oam_> so i have a clean install NO extra stuff
[05:42] <squib> astro76: no 7.10.  this is partly because I'm running ubuntu under the parallels VM manager
[05:42] <Ubuntu101> riotkittie: oy! thought it was 128
[05:42] <ice9__> package and source
[05:42] <DanMulvey> thanks to everyone that helped; everything is working great for me now
[05:42] <sistom> Guess no help for me
[05:43] <sistom> :\
[05:43] <Ubuntu101> need one of the *boxs
[05:43] <ice9__> I still can't run update-manager
[05:43] <oam_> then i just went to restriced manager and selected to install Nvidia drivers
[05:43] <asbani> briantumor: but give it a try :) if there is only one WM That can be run in a 64mb ram system it diffnently would be fluxbox
[05:43] <squib> astro76: the custom driver parallels had loaded for ubuntu broke under 7.10, so I had to replace the xorg.conf file by hand to get into the desktop
[05:43] <squib> with vesa drivers
[05:43] <mechdave> jotil, Thx anyhow :P
[05:43] <oam_> after the reboot i get no display when it tries to load GDM
[05:43] <limecat> is there any reason not to use LVM?
[05:43] <astro76> squib, huh... I had that happen in Feisty, and unlocking all the items stopped it
[05:43] <logyati> hello
[05:43] <manjunath> hi all,

[05:43] <squib> astro76: OK let me look for the locking option

[05:43] <scriptdevil> oam_: i have a quick fix.. press ctrlaltf1 and type in your login.. then type startx
[05:43] <oam_> to get X to load again , i did a manual edit on the xorg.conf file and changed back to the "nv" drivers
[05:44] <manjunath> how do I mount my windows drive from ubuntu so that I can start writing to the disk(windows) ? - appreciate your help guys

[05:44] <asbani> whats the package to install identd? I have the port forwarded in my router, but i need to install a package/service i think
[05:44] <joanki> aw man! i thought i was done
[05:44] <Ubuntu101> Ok, thinking on this... can somone inform me of what the "Composite Extension" is and how I might go about getting it ;). I'm thinking that apt-get Ubuntu-desktop may have missed something....
[05:44] <sistom> ty Vlet
[05:44] <Jaszbo> oam--reboot and boot into the live CD with 'Install in safe graphics mode."
[05:44] <scriptdevil> manjunath: well.. just right click and mount volume
[05:44] <martyvis_> joanki: does it stop the install from continuing?
[05:44] <briantumor> so ubuntu cd comes with fluxbox?
[05:44] <Helmi> kingnothing, thanks that worked (compiz settings)
[05:45] <oam_> scriptdevil : cause i have already changed back to the "nv" drivers, should i change back to the "nvidia" restricted drivers before i try  this stuff ?
[05:45] <joanki> no, but i dont want to mess with my system
[05:45] <asbani> briantumor: nop, it comes with gnome by default
[05:45] <astro76> briantumor, no
=== ice9__ is now known as fit4lfe
[05:45] <Ubuntu101> briantumor: no, but there is a fluxubuntu distro out I *think*
[05:45] <manjunath> scriptdevil, what do I do next ?
[05:45] <scriptdevil> Ubuntu101: it is used to enable compositing.. like cool graphics stuff
[05:45] <joanki> it says i can continue but that the test of the file system with type fat16 in partition #1 found uncorrected errors
[05:45] <Helmi> i know still have one problem left - all windows open up with the title (window title) behind the top gnome panel
[05:45] <martyvis_> do youhave an existing windows parition then?
[05:45] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: According to this article you can ignore the error (Press Ignore) http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-475618.html
[05:45] <Helmi> this seems to be related to compiz too
[05:45] <scriptdevil> oam_: try both
[05:45] <joanki> ok
[05:45] <squib> astro76: I can unlock the power off button but not the enable networking icon
[05:45] <Motyoj> if you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to ask someone else first...
[05:45] <Ubuntu101> scriptdevil, yes I know that much ;). What is it called in the package manager?
[05:45] <Helmi> does anyone know how to prevent from that?
[05:45] <squib> astro76: problem is the networking icon and the shutdown icon are transposed
[05:45] <scriptdevil> manjunath: just double click it
[05:45] <oam_> Jaszabo : i have already done a fresh install
[05:45] <oam_> ..
[05:45] <asbani> whats the package to install identd? I have the port forwarded in my router, but i need to install a package/service.
[05:45] <joanki> CRAP!~  lost everything!
[05:45] <martyvis_> did you have an existing fat16 that you didn't change or move?
[05:45] <oam_> Scrpitdevil : Ok .. well im in X atm, using the "nv" driver ...
[05:45] <astro76> squib, that's in the system tray, you have to right click the left edge of the system tray (should be a "handle" there )
[05:46] <joanki> no one TYPE i need to go find all of it
[05:46] <manjunath> scriptdevil, ok I opend the window that has some files on it
[05:46] <squib> astro76: ok stand by
[05:46] <admin8tor> inetd or xinetd
[05:46] <oam_> I'll change back to "nvidia" driver and try the ctrl+alt+F1 and try to get X going ... I'll report back in a couple of mins
[05:46] <scriptdevil> Ubuntu101: well.. tried setting->window manager tweaks??
[05:46] <Ishi> hi all, i have looked all over. and in prolly in the wrong places to find out what params i shoud use in GRUB4DOS to load the ubuntu ISO as a liveCD instead of it booting right away in install modus. anyway to get this working?
[05:46] <scriptdevil> manjunath: thats what you wanted right?
[05:47] <joanki> i gthink i saved it
=== Ishi is now known as Ishidropi

[05:48] <joanki> swap:  use as swap, beginning, 1500 MB; root is / use as ext3, beginning, 12000MB; and home is /home, ext3 , beginning, 24585 MB
[05:48] <Vlet> Ubuntu101: that means your video card either doesn't have 3d acceleration, or your card is not supported... you may have to install restricted drivers
[05:48] <scriptdevil> manjunath: cant you??
[05:48] <joanki> does that sound right, INtuitive?
[05:48] <squib> astro76: er, sorry that link I thought was gonna load sean connery
[05:48] <squib> oh well
[05:48] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: hmm, I can get that from synaptic?
[05:48] <jotil> logyati, install Synaptics
[05:48] <arun_> hello kids
[05:48] <logyati> i asked, u didnt see
[05:48] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Looks good to me
[05:48] <joanki> k
[05:48] <joanki> thx
[05:48] <manjunath> scriptdevil, no for some reason I can't write data, I guess its only readonly
[05:48] <arun_> if i'm upgrading to gutsy, should i disable all my third party repos before i upgrade?
[05:48] <Vlet> arun_: Hi dad
[05:48] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: go to Applications and then Add/Remove
[05:48] <manjunath> scriptdevil, how do I make it both read/write
[05:48] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: you can get it from there or Synaptic
[05:48] <scriptdevil> well.. manjunath is this an ntfs partition?
[05:49] <joanki> oh man there's always more
[05:49] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: I seem to already have it...
[05:49] <jrib> !upgrade > arun_ (read the private message from ubotu)
[05:49] <joanki> it says select accounts you would like to import and fill in the form below for each one.... do i want to import my xp?
[05:49] <Ishidropi> (quite the busy day in here)
[05:49] <jrib> arun_: update manager should do that for you
[05:49] <arun_> jrib: alright
[05:49] <iobelisk> hey, has anybody had this problem- sometimes when i just log in, i switch desktop via the workspace switcher and all my menus and windows disappear. i have only the blank desktop which i can grab with the mouse and move the cube around, but all desktops lose their windows and menus, everything..?
[05:49] <Ubuntu101> Vlet: ok, already installed the drivers, so I suppose the card is not supported by compiz. Would be nice if that error said a bit more then that though... I was suspecting a malfunctioning install (of ubuntu-desktop)
[05:49] <jotil> logyati: man synaptics
[05:49] <arun_> jrib: I did read the upgrade notes, just had that doubt
[05:50] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: hmm it should be in your applications list then maybe under graphics?
[05:50] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: I have never have it offer me any at that point, but unless there's something vital a clean install might be better since you're not deleting Windows
[05:50] <manjunath> scriptdevil, yes I think so
[05:50] <q_a_z_steve> anyone know keyboard macro program I can get really quick?
[05:50] <logyati> jotil, i tried but it said that there is a replacement for this packet called tpconfig
[05:50] <joanki> k
[05:50] <asbani> IntuitiveNipple: I just installed oidentd before your post, will that replace them aswell?
[05:50] <Jaszbo> I need some help with getting my wlan to work
[05:50] <Vlet> Ubuntu101: yeah, it would :/
[05:50] <oxeimon> ShadowMinds: nope I don't see it...
[05:50] <agwells> has anyone figured out how to fix the issue with the usb drives, failing to reconize new devices after some time passes with the opperating system on.... this only happened in 7.10 on HP laptop??
[05:50] <IntuitiveNipple> asbani: Not sure, but any is good. I was just listing some alternates shown by synaptic
[05:51] <mpeters> is there an one step way to set all cflag and lib flag variables to $PATH?
[05:51] <nj786> is the final version of 7.10 out?
[05:51] <Ubuntu101> yes
[05:51] <fit4lfe> what python version does update-manager use
[05:51] <fit4lfe> is it 2.4
[05:51] <Vantage13> hi, I've got a system76 daru2 using intel 3945 for wireless.  I ugraded to gutsy and everything was fine using the ipw3945 and then today I rebooted and suddenly wireless isn't working anymore.  Rebooting repeatedly makes no difference.  ipw3945 and ieee80211 are loaded, but there's not wlan0 interface for some reason....
[05:51] <scriptdevil> manjunath: is this an ntfs drive you are talking about?
[05:51] <nrdb> nj786, yes
[05:51] <fit4lfe> caus right now my default version is 2.5
[05:51] <ShadowMinds> Oxeimon: hmm guess you could look in Synaptic for any other ATI stuff
[05:51] <nj786> nrdb: no beta right?

[05:51] <nj786> nrdb: where can i get an update
[05:52] <Vampyric> Where can you edit the color of the text on the gnome panel?

[05:52] <Laser87> Hi! Anybody using Gran Paradiso Firefox 3.08a? Problems?
[05:52] <scriptdevil> manjunath: install ntfs-utils
[05:52] <manjunath> scriptdevil, ok
[05:52] <nj786> nrdb: is there another way like a sudo commanf
[05:52] <joanki> how long does it generally take to install ubuntu?

[05:52] <nrdb> nj786, what are you running ?
[05:52] <mpeters> joanki:  15-30min
[05:52] <fit4lfe> how can i change the python version ?
[05:53] <scriptdevil> joanki: from 10 to 50 mins
[05:53] <Vlet> joanki: 15 minutes or so
[05:53] <asbani> IntuitiveNipple: I installed midentd now. and I can't find the service in "system > admin > services"

[05:53] <bcardarella> Wireless issue: it seems like my card is recognized (Belkin Pre-N PCMCIA) and when I click on the Networking icon I can see the available networks to connect to.

[05:53] <fit4lfe> but now i can't use update-manager
[05:53] <mpeters> anyone on setting all of the compiler flags to check my path as opposed to manually setting every variable?
[05:53] <limecat> test
[05:53] <drama1981> joanki it depends on system specs. if done it in as little as 15 mins. but its took as long as 45 on low specs machines
[05:53] <arghh2d2> hi nrdb, still workin on it, any luck with you?
[05:53] <fit4lfe> which uses pygtk

[05:53] <Laser87> scriptdevil: so I wanted to ask, if I'm the only one with this
[05:53] <Vlet> nj786: it's not a good idea to upgrade using apt, as the update manager does more than a dist-upgrade using apt would
[05:53] <and_moi> Ash-Fox, you can always send stuff to a non-existant ip on your network...gone to oblivion
[05:54] <Dialntone> wow i found the ultimate Video editor for Ubuntu :D
[05:54] <Ubuntu101> also downloaing the language files takes a fair amount of time

[05:54] <IntuitiveNipple> Dialntone: which one?
[05:54] <jrib> fit4lfe: you need to be more specific about what exactly your issue is and pastebin any errors you have
[05:54] <joanki> Intuitive, thanks SO much
[05:54] <nrdb> nj786, "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" should do it, you might want to backup before hand thou.

[05:56] <ShakaGoldSaint> hi there, i'm trying to install ubuntu 7.10 using the live cd, but when i select manual partitioning, the install wizard doesn't show my partitions :(
[05:56] <WGGMk> 1. How do I change the name of a NIC from eth2 to eth1??? 2. if i have 2 NIC's eth0 and eth2... eth0 being connected to a cable modem.. and eth2 being connected to a router.. how can i tell the browser which NIC to use when requesting a page????
[05:56] <manjunath> scriptdevil, what do I do once the instln is done ?
[05:56] <Dialntone> those other software apps suck. i can't wait to fiddle with this one
[05:56] <astro76> Vlet, in what way is using Update Manager different than apt-get dist-upgrade?
[05:56] <nj786> nrdb: do you know how to update it from the site?
[05:56] <limecat> can anyone tell me if there are any issues with LVM?  any reason not to install using it?  also, can an encrypted LVM drive have its encryption removed if needed?
[05:57] <scriptdevil> well... i never used ntfs.. i installed my xp on a fat 32
[05:57] <nrdb> nj786, no I don't
[05:57] <jotil> WGGMk: man route
[05:57] <darkhack> anyone know a fix on gutsy for vlc
[05:57] <moDumass> someone please help me out here, no system tray sucks
[05:57] <manjunath> scriptdevil, hey buddy I am done installing ntfsprogs
[05:57] <arghh2d2> nrdb: nothing to brag about so far, still working on it.
[05:57] <and_moi> ShakaGoldSaint, the live/cd install can be finicky...try partitioning manually (gparted is on the live cd and will do the trick) prior to formatting if needed
[05:57] <Vlet> astro76: I'm repeating what I originally heard from Pici
[05:57] <jotil> WGGMk: set the default gateway
[05:57] <Ishidropi> and_moi: so atm i'm using XP. i should just copy the iso from C to D and it should be loading asif i had it booting off the CD-drive?

[05:58] <yellow_chicken> how to mount windows share folder using "alt-f2" then type in a command?
[05:59] <extrakick> hello there
[05:59] <yellow_chicken> mount it in nautilus
[05:59] <limecat> can anyone answer a few quick questions regarding LVM :\
[05:59] <astro76> nj786, yes that is what it is for
[05:59] <Vlet> nj786: sorry, afk...
[05:59] <WGGMk> jotil: ok, eth2 is connected to a router and eth0 is connected to a modem.. by default if i request a web page.. it uses eth0.. i need to access the config page on my router from eth2.. how can this be done
[05:59] <Vlet> !upgrade | nj786
[05:59] <jrib> limecat: best to just ask the channel your next question and see if anyone knows the answer
[05:59] <ubotu> nj786: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:59] <extrakick> recenty i installed a iso mouting software called acetone or somoehting like that
[05:59] <KeithWeisshar> why does wubi write to config.sys on windows vista?
[05:59] <WGGMk> jotil: then my other question was how do i rename a NIC from eth2 to eth1?
[05:59] <extrakick> it installed KDE modeules on my gnome ubuntu 7.04
[05:59] <arghh2d2> nrdb, i'm just trying to auto mount the partition that my iso is on first.
[05:59] <and_moi> Ishidropi, if it's from XP, I'm not too familiar with such, but it defo would be a bios thing (you'd need to boot from the ISO) any reason why you don't just burn the image to a disc and install from there? I could tell you how to do it from within a linux environment, but not windows, sorry.
[05:59] <KeithWeisshar> why does the wubi installer write to config.sys even on a vista pc
[05:59] <arun_> if i reinstall virtualbox on gutsy, will i be able to re-use my virtual hard drive file from feisty?
[06:00] <extrakick> so i then removed it, but eve since i removed it seems ubuntu starts acting up every now and then
[06:00] <nj786> Vlet: is it ok to update from update manager? if not can you explain why it isnt and what i should do please.
[06:00] <limecat> i want to know if A) there are reasons not to use LVM, B) if an encrypted LVM drive can have its encryption later removed or disabled (ie, if i wanted to turn it off)
[06:00] <chowmeined> KeithWeisshar: backwards compatibility?
[06:00] <jotil> WGGMk: then i answered your question. change your default gateway. with the route command: man route
[06:00] <Kousotu> can someone answer a quick qustion reguarding ndiswrapper?
[06:00] <scriptdevil> AudreyM: i have heard that vista doesnt allow tyou to dual boot it with linux... anyway.. use smart-boot manager orr something like it
[06:00] <Vantage13> how do I get gnome-keyring to prompt me for my password when logging in? (for nm-applet)
[06:00] <subpar> has anyone had luck networking a vista box and an ubuntu box?
[06:00] <Vlet> nj786: yes. I thought you were asking for a way to do it from the commandline
[06:00] <nrdb> arghh2d2, wouldn't that just be a line in the /etc/fstab file ?
[06:00] <chowmeined> limecat: LVM adds complexity and it requires to have an init ramdrive... no you cant disable encryption
[06:00] <extrakick> would it be ok to uninstall any kd3 module, im assuming that is was is conflicint with gnome, although im very new to linux so im not sure
[06:00] <allobjects> If I run  the upgrade to 7.10 via update-manager will it automatically use the existing apt-cacher setup on my network ?
[06:00] <krammer> yes me subpar
[06:00] <nj786> Vlet: no i was just asking what would be the safest and best option
[06:00] <subpar> how did you do it?
[06:01] <fit4lfe> http://rafb.net/p/7ICrht77.html
[06:01] <WGGMk> jotil: wouldnt that change it permanitly so all requests are thru the specific eth.. meaning i would have to change it back?
[06:01] <subpar> did you do the samba 3.0 deal?
[06:01] <AudreyM> scriptdevil: so, the standard installer with gutsy won't cut it?
[06:01] <fit4lfe> jrib http://rafb.net/p/7ICrht77.html
[06:01] <asbani> I installed pidentd. but i can't seem to be able to run the service, can somebody help me with that
[06:01] <Kousotu> can someone answer a quick qustion reguarding ndiswrapper?
[06:01] <jrib> fit4lfe: so why do you say you are using the wrong python version?
[06:01] <IntuitiveNipple> scriptdevil: I have Vista dual-booting fine, GRUB just picked it up first time
[06:01] <scriptdevil> AudreyM: ask the others..
[06:01] <Vlet> nj786: are you upgrading from feisty, or from a prerelease of gutsy?
[06:01] <arghh2d2> nrdb, ?  what am i sposed to do to the line?
[06:01] <krammer> what is the problem sub?
[06:01] <nj786> Vlet: fiesty
[06:01] <scriptdevil> IntuitiveNipple: thats great... i am sorry if i misled you AudreyM
[06:01] <limecat> chowmeined: is the added complexity generally worth it, in your opinion, or is it more hassel than its worth?  Also, can the encryption password ever be changed?
[06:01] <Vlet> !ask | Kousotu
[06:01] <ubotu> Kousotu: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:01] <Ishidropi> and_moi: the thing is that CDdrives make too much noise and running an ISO from HD is faster. i've always done this with Knoppix with the bootfrom command. but this apperently doesnt work with the Ubuntu LiveCD.
[06:01] <Ap0ll0> gusty compiz gone gay
[06:02] <Vlet> nj786: then the recommended way is on that page I linked to
[06:02] <nrdb> arghh2d2, what device did you put the iso on ?
[06:02] <IntuitiveNipple> scriptdevil: I think most problems are with 'non-standard' configurations with muitple disks
[06:02] <jotil> WGGMk: just change it back when you won't need it.
[06:02] <chowmeined> limecat: i use LVM, it allows me to easily start with small partitions and resize them as my storage needs change
[06:02] <arghh2d2> nrdb, hda8
[06:02] <Kousotu> the proper driver asigner for infs is "sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver here>" right?

[06:02] <dizy> hi guys...i just installed 7.1 server.. it autodetected my RTL8169 gigabit nic card just fine... but it seems to be working only at 100 ... yes i have a gigabit switch and it shows other computers connected at 1000 but ubuntu box 100 ... i checked and the cables aren't the problems .. can anyone suggest anything

[06:03] <chowmeined> limecat: i guess i need to be more clear about the encryption.. the only one ive used is dmcrypt... and as far as I know, you cant change the password or disable the encryption
[06:03] <jrib> fit4lfe: did you do anything that you think may have caused this?
[06:03] <Ubuntu101> Ok, does anyone have a rough idea of how many downloads of ubuntu 7.10 there have been? compared to 7.04?
[06:03] <fit4lfe> yes installed pylons
[06:03] <WGGMk> jotil: thanks i figured i would have to do something similar.. how do i determine the default gateway.. is it shown in ifconfig?
[06:03] <jotil> WGGMk: to change the name: http://www.science.uva.nl/research/air/wiki/LogicalInterfaceNames
[06:03] <fit4lfe> jrib yes installed pylons
[06:03] <krammer>  can u see the bootloader?
[06:03] <Vlet> Ubuntu101: more :)
[06:03] <chowmeined> limecat: i mean the method to do both would be to copy the data to another partition and then replace the previous

[06:03] <limecat> chowmeined: i see, thanks.  So with LVM i can change the size of even an ext3 root partition?
[06:04] <Allenwr> anyone know how much space knoppix requires?
[06:04] <and_moi> Ishidropi, hmm...If you've done the same from knoppix it should be similar for *buntu..those 'cheatcodes' are pure kernel and grub stuff...not distro specific. What error are you getting? My only concern is that if you're not booting from grub...how are you even entering those for NT loader?
[06:04] <Vlet> !upgrade | [Trash]_
[06:04] <ubotu> [Trash]_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[06:04] <nrdb> arghh2d2, "/dev/hda8 /media/hda8 auto defaults 0 0" should do.   Make sure that /media/hda8 exists.
[06:04] <jrib> fit4lfe: what is "easy_install"?
[06:04] <subpar> krammer, no, can't see anything... we worked around it since I dual boot, but I really hate being in windows unless I'm working in proprietary software

[06:04] <n2diy> Allenwr: Knoppix 3.6 uses about 3 gig.
[06:04] <nj786> Vlet: ?
[06:04] <jotil> WGGMk: it will show you the routing table
[06:04] <chowmeined> limecat: LVM is just the logical volume.. which you can shrink and grow online at any time
[06:04] <nrdb> arghh2d2, you can also use the mount command to do it manually.
[06:04] <chowmeined> limecat: however, you also need to change the size of the filesystem (in your case ext3)
[06:04] <Allenwr> ok, so to be safe, just go with 5 gigs for 5.1.1?
[06:04] <Wolf23> somebody help please!
[06:05] <Vlet> nj786: what?
[06:05] <chowmeined> limecat: ext3 can be grown online.. but it can only be shrunk offline
[06:05] <Ishidropi> and_moi: i'm booting from GRUB. GRUB4WIN has been adapted to run off NTFS drives and thus enabling easy linux booting from the NT loader via GRUB

[06:07] <limecat> chowmeined: yea, except ive decided ima do a clean install each upgrade---i screw WAY too much up every 6 months :D
[06:07] <nrdb> arghh2d2, grub uses the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to know what to do, as far as I know that is the only config file it uses.

[06:07] <joanki> right?
[06:07] <Ishidropi> and_moi: when i started the same ISO in QEMU, it started fine as a liveCD, but that maybe because i set only the ISO to boot als CD in QEMU

[06:09] <Vlet> nj786: yep
[06:09] <chowmeined> limecat: i like to separate them because, /tmp is world writable and i can set it noexec .. /var stores log files which can grow to large sizes sometimes, as well as all the html, databases etc... /usr should be fairly readonly so standard users cant tamper with it
[06:09] <smy1220> Clean install of Gusty. open terminal type sudo gconf-editor ot to apps->nautilis->desktop heck off the: Computer, Trash, Network icons and nothing!!!! Reboot does not solve it!!! Is 7.10 using a different location for this setting?
[06:09] <Kousotu> sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver>   is this correct?
[06:09] <nj786> Vlet: how is it?
[06:09] <mechdave> Wolf23: Sorry mate that is not my area of expertise, I usually just backup my /home and do a fresh install!
[06:09] <ShakaGoldSaint> i'm trying to install gutsy from livecd, but it doesn't show my partitions, neither the installation program nor gparted, it only shows /dev/sda, no partitions
[06:09] <Lustblader> hello all
[06:09] <ShakaGoldSaint> however
[06:09] <freaker> hello, i want to install a panel, but i don't know it's name. It's the bottom panel like in this clip - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0N14ax1iKc&mode=related&search=
[06:09] <joanki> ok so now i am booting
[06:09] <ademan> is it ok if the "Select and install software" step on the alternate cd fails?
[06:09] <joanki> and it is ofering me 3 options
[06:09] <arang2> so i shouldnt even dare to install automatix for gutsy?
[06:10] <Vlet> nj786: great. I did a clean install, as I keep all my documents, etc on another partition
[06:10] <astro76> !automatix | arang2
[06:10] <ubotu> arang2: Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.  A creditable analysis from a debian/ubuntu developer is here - http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html (Additional information: /msg ubotu worksforme)
[06:10] <ShakaGoldSaint> ls /dev | grep sda, shows my partitions
[06:10] <joanki> Ubuntu 7.10 kernel 2.6.22-14 generic
[06:10] <Ishidropi> and_moi: nope. the same iso was used in QEMU
[06:10] <joanki> the other is the recovery mode but exactly the same
[06:10] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, tried fdisk ?
[06:10] <joanki> or Ubuntu 7.10 memtest86+
[06:10] <jrib> !upgrade > Wolf23 (read the private message from ubotu)
[06:10] <joanki> which one do i want?
[06:10] <limecat> i see.....i may do that
[06:10] <Kousotu> sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver>   is this correct?
[06:10] <chowmeined> limecat: it may not be as useful on a standard desktop machine
[06:10] <bbrown> I Just got gutsy and firefox is a mess.  Anybody else having a problem with Firefox. I already had opera, I guess I need to use that more
[06:10] <fit4lfe> jrib yes but this was before they updated to the new versino
=== speaker219_ is now known as Pidgin
[06:10] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: The first of those
[06:10] <fit4lfe> jrib how can i fix this
[06:10] <joanki> thx
[06:10] <agwells> Kousotu: yeah there are also programs to do that for you...
[06:10] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, you mean the fdisk tool for windows?
=== Pidgin is now known as []
[06:11] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Recovery is for if you have some major problems at any time
[06:11] <Wolf23> jrib:  thanx , but i read the site, and i need someone to help me with it, thanx
[06:11] <limecat> chowmeined: yea, i may just do the /tmp, not sure on /home
[06:11] <joanki> would it be correct to say that ubuntu is a linux-based operating system?
[06:11] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, no Linux, same name.
=== [] is now known as [|]
[06:11] <agwells> Kousotu but <driver> needs to point to the file.inf
[06:11] <jrib> fit4lfe: ok... what does 'readlink -f $(which python)' return?
=== [|] is now known as [
[06:11] <chowmeined> limecat: but for power users.. and on servers.. it provides additional security (you can set nosuid, noexec, ro, options per mount) as well as allowing you to use a different filesystem depending on how that mount will be used
[06:11] <limecat> i REALLY screw things up, even wine, so my .wine is shot\
[06:11] <Kousotu> agwells: yea, but I only have 1 with which I need ndis for
[06:11] <jrib> Wolf23: what is your questionL
[06:11] <n2diy> joanki: yes, it would.
[06:11] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, what does that do? how can i use it?
[06:11] <joanki> thx
[06:11] <Kousotu> and I knew thst
[06:11] <Kousotu> that*
[06:11] <and_moi> Ishidropi, sorry, I'm outta ideas. It really shouldn't be a boot option/kernel param because the live/desktop iso should boot into the live environment and then give you the chance to install. There's not really an override for that to bring you straight to an install
[06:11] <arghh2d2> nrdb brb
[06:11] <limecat> even my home folder needs to go, i back up the data and format :\
[06:11] <joanki> it looks like an apple interface (desktop i mean)
[06:11] <jared> joanki, ubuntu IS Linux. Linux is linux...and ubuntu is just a distro OF linux. Suse is a distro...redhat etc.
[06:11] <TBird> joakim-: in as much as there is no 'linux' operating system, just a kernel, sure.
[06:11] <Spisters> joanki, Ubuntu is linux
[06:11] <fit4lfe> jrib in python do thtat
[06:12] <chowmeined> limecat: thats fair.. you could still keep them separate.. you wont lose anything
[06:12] <freaker> does anyone knows the name of the panel in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0N14ax1iKc&mode=related&search=   ?
[06:12] <agwells> Kousotu so whats the question?
[06:12] <BlaenkDenum> !mountwindows
[06:12] <ubotu> ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[06:12] <jrib> fit4lfe: in a shell (not python)
[06:12] <chowmeined> limecat: i just do it out of habit
[06:12] <n2diy> Spisters: that is not correct.
[06:12] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Yes, it is a GNU/Linux distribution :)
[06:12] <Kousotu> I wanted to make sure I had the command right
[06:12] <joanki> oh
[06:12] <Wolf23> jrib:  how can i update ubuntu7.10, coz i am using now ubuntu7.04 x86 amd64, tell me what commands i have to type?
[06:12] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, have you the LiveCD going ?
[06:12] <joanki> i'm learning so much these days i cant keep it straght!
[06:12] <Kousotu> because I need it for my internet driver
=== jared is now known as KI4IKL
[06:12] <Kousotu> {L}âUghîñ Ôut £òU{Ð}
[06:12] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: The learning never stops!
[06:12] <limecat> chowmeined: yea, i did that already, but it didnt set up gnome with gutsy defaults--it respected old settings, when i want to see what "vanilla" gutsy looks/feels like
[06:12] <Vlet> !upgrade | Wolf23
[06:12] <ubotu> Wolf23: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[06:12] <Kousotu> otherwise I can't go online
[06:12] <Lustblader> lulz @ joanki
[06:12] <Spisters> Linux is an umbrella term for a variety of open source distros like this one,
[06:12] <chowmeined> limecat: actually what i have setup on mine is... i did LVM for all the system's / /tmp /usr /var and swap.. but i did software RAID 1 for /home
[06:12] <jrib> Wolf23: the page explains that
[06:12] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, yep, i'm using it right now
[06:12] <Ishidropi> and_moi: apparently there is, but thanks anyway. i'll go fiddle around some more. have a nice day ;)
[06:13] <agwells> if you just type in ndiswrapper tells you the commands.. you also need to do a modprobe ndiswrapper
[06:13] <jimmygoon> What options do I pass mount to allow user read/write/
[06:13] <extrakick> astro76,thats weird because i reccently instaled AcetoneISO2, and it didnt do wat i wanted so i uninstalled it, but i didnt know exactly what other kde dependencies it installed
[06:13] <manjunath> thank you script
[06:13] <limecat> chowmeined: now THERES a thought o.0
[06:13] <Kousotu> I was aware of that as wel
[06:13] <Ishidropi> http://en.wikipedia.org/linux/
[06:13] <Kousotu> well*
[06:13] <and_moi> Ishidropi, hope you find it, sorry I couldn't help. The forums might provide the answer
[06:13] <jrib> Wolf23: what part of the instructions on the wiki page are not clear?
[06:13] <Lustblader> !chmod | jimmygoon
[06:13] <ubotu> jimmygoon: The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[06:13] <optiq> hey, does anyone know a good security tut/primer for ubuntu?
[06:13] <Wolf23> jrib:  are u free for me, coz i am newbie on this, pleasee
[06:13] <freaker> i mean the bottom panel from the clip.. ?
[06:13] <extrakick> since i uninstalled it, things have been freezin which never used to, or ubuntu would just stop responding
[06:13] <joanki> one last question
[06:13] <agwells> So anyone know a fix for the USB issue.....
[06:13] <Spisters> did anyone else have an issue with minimizing windows after the update?
[06:13] <Falstius> what do people use for latex?  I was using auctex with emacs21, but it doesn't work with emacs22 (I could regress, or modify some system files but I figure that if this isn't supported its because there is a better way)
[06:13] <fit4lfe> jrib readlink -f $(python2.5)
[06:13] <chowmeined> limecat: it works fairly well.. even though my drives are different sizes.. (320GB and 160GB).. the software raid is flexible enough to let me do it efficiently
[06:13] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, just checking, do you know what device your HDD is ?
[06:13] <jimmygoon> Lustblader, not quite what I wanted. I know how to use chmod... I was loking for mount options :S
[06:13] <jimmygoon> !mount
[06:13] <joanki> so now, i can access files on xp by going to sda2 drive, but can i access files in ubuntu from xp?
[06:13] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted (also "man mkfs" for formatting) - Mounting partitions in Gnome under Dapper: System -> Administration -> Disks - For Edgy, see !fstab and !DiskMounter
[06:13] <Kousotu> agwells: what USB issue?
[06:13] <hendrixski> is there a guide written yet for how to solve graphics card issues in Gutsy?
[06:14] <agwells> TEXMAKER
[06:14] <fit4lfe> jrib like that
[06:14] <limecat> wait, do you have to LVM both drives?
[06:14] <Vlet> Wolf23: if you have questions, ask them here.
[06:14] <jrib> fit4lfe: ok... what does 'readlink -f $(which python)' return?
[06:14] <fit4lfe> jrib nothing
[06:14] <limecat> and how harsh on cpu is it
[06:14] <agwells> USB devices stop automounting after a certain time...
[06:14] <hendrixski> because my graphics card seems to not be getting used. it's all going to the CPU.... how do I fix this?
[06:14] <n2diy> optiq: what security concerns do you have?
[06:14] <Vlet> Wolf23: that way, the question is out there for everyone to potentially answer
[06:14] <Ishidropi> and_moi: i could find nothing in the forums, thats why i came here. if i'm still at a loss after retry. i'll just post it in the forums and see what happens
[06:14] <chowmeined> limecat: no i have LVM on 1/2 of the 320GB.. and then raid 1 on the 160GB and the other half
[06:14] <jrib> fit4lfe: join me in #ubuntu-classroom
[06:14] <agwells> LaTeX = texlive, and TEXMAKER
[06:14] <chowmeined> limecat: i dont notice at all...
[06:14] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: get the drivers
[06:14] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Not by default, but there *is* an ext3 file-system driver for Windows... Google should help you locate it
[06:14] <fit4lfe> jrib k
[06:14] <optiq> I just wanted to know what were some basic steps i should take with this destroy beyond installing firestarter etc.
[06:14] <Bax> does ubuntu come with a firewall pre-installed or some safety internet connection stuff?  If so how can I access it and/or modify it?
[06:14] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, /dev/sda ?
=== silent is now known as silent-blazing
[06:14] <freaker> ???
[06:14] <Wolf23> Vlet:  are u free friend, can u help me updating from ubuntu7.04 to 7.10 x86 amd64?
[06:14] <limecat> o.0 alright, ima head off and begin the adventure.
[06:14] <astro76> extrakick, what's weird?
[06:14] <Kousotu> agwells: I never had an issue yet
[06:14] <hendrixski> BlaenkDenum, how? when I click on system-->RestrictedDriversManager there's nothing there
[06:14] <jrib> Wolf23: sure, just let me know what part of the wiki page is not clear
[06:15] <limecat> this will be interesting o.0
[06:15] <joanki> Intuitive, but i CAN access windows' files, right?
[06:15] <chowmeined> limecat: unless im copying huge files around... in which case its a bit slower
[06:15] <agwells> unplug usb device replug in
[06:15] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: do you know what brand your video card is?
[06:15] <agwells> tell me if it has an issue
[06:15] <zetheroo> can someone help me with the fingerprint reader setup?
[06:15] <Lustblader> joanki: yes
[06:15] <limecat> btw, do you recommend any of the usage options (inode sizes) for particular partitions?
[06:15] <hendrixski> BlaenkDenum, ATI mobility radeon 7500
[06:15] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, in a terminal, the command would be "sudo fdisk /dev/sda"
[06:15] <Vlet> Wolf23: the instructions are all on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[06:15] <joanki> and through that drive, if i PLACE things in that drive, then when i get into windows, i can open it, right?
[06:15] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Yes, from Ubuntu. By default Gutsy installs the ntfs-3g driver that gives read/write access to Windows file-systems
[06:15] <chowmeined> limecat: i haven't messed with those
[06:15] <Wolf23> jrib:  i dont like to put my hand and make errors :(
[06:15] <limecat> alright
[06:15] <extrakick>  astro76,thats weird because i reccently instaled AcetoneISO2, and it didnt do wat i wanted so i uninstalled it, but i didnt know exactly what other kde dependencies it installed
[06:15] <Falstius> agwells: that looks interesting, I'll look into it.  Does it have nice keyboard shortcuts like emacs?
[06:15] <limecat> thanks for all the info :)
[06:15] <chowmeined> limecat: thats another benefit though.. you can tune them for each mount
[06:15] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: hmm, I'm not so sure buddy
[06:15] <joanki> ok
[06:15] <extrakick> since i uninstalled it, things have been freezin which never used to, or ubuntu would just stop responding
[06:15] <BlaenkDenum> !ati | hendrixski
[06:15] <Lustblader> joanki: windows cannot acess ext3 drives
[06:15] <limecat> yea, i saw that
[06:15] <joanki> that's pretty damned sweet
[06:15] <dizy>  hi guys...i just installed 7.1 server.. it autodetected my RTL8169 gigabit nic card just fine... but it seems to be working only at 100 ... yes i have a gigabit switch and it shows other computers connected at 1000 but ubuntu box 100 ... i checked and the cables aren't the problems .. can anyone suggest anything
[06:15] <optiq> n2diy: Did that make any sense?
[06:15] <BlaenkDenum> !ati
[06:15] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, is this a new drive ?
[06:15] <jrib> Wolf23: then ask if you are not sure about something
[06:16] <BlaenkDenum> ubotu: you there
[06:16] <joanki> Lustblader, if i place the file inside the sda2 file drive, windows should be able to access it, no?
[06:16] <BlaenkDenum> !nvidia
[06:16] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, nope
[06:16] <Spisters> joanki, no not unless you go find the program that will allow you to see the format that Ubuntu uses
[06:16] <agwells> yes... and customizable ones too
[06:16] <hendrixski> looks like ubotu is on vacation
[06:16] <astro76> extrakick, yes I read that and asked what is weird? Are you saying the remaining kde libs are causing problems?
[06:16] <freaker> does anyone knows the name of the bottom panel in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0N14ax1iKc&mode=related&search=   ?
[06:16] <BlaenkDenum> what's with the bot
[06:16] <limecat> but in my past experience, any time i tried to "tweak", ive screwed things up (ie, rolling my own kernel--performance didnt improve :\)
[06:16] <chowmeined> limecat: or like use XFS for ones that will have large files and ext3 of standard.. or however you want it setup
[06:16] <joanki> oh
[06:16] <ubotu> hendrixski: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:16] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about you there - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi

[06:16] <BlaenkDenum> there you go hendrixski :)
[06:16] <extrakick> astro76, yes i think so
[06:16] <BlaenkDenum> hopefully that helps
[06:16] <n2diy> optiq: What? I missed it in all the other traffic.
[06:16] <hendrixski> BlaenkDenum, k, I'll check that one out.
[06:16] <chowmeined> limecat: actually i love XFS for storing virtual machine images
[06:16] <Lustblader> joanki: if the drive format is fat32, ntfs.. then yes
[06:16] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, i had feisty + windows xp before
[06:16] <FX_> Hullo?
[06:16] <Wolf23> jrib:  i am ready to update 7.10 x86 amd64
[06:16] <joanki> ok yay!!!!
[06:16] <extrakick> astro76, because i didnt have these freezing problems before
[06:16] <joanki> that's pretty damned cool
[06:16] <smy1220> BAX: sudo apt-get install firestarter
[06:16] <chowmeined> limecat: because it has excellent support for um.. 'holes'
[06:16] <d|v> anybody else having problems mounting external hard drive with gutsy?
[06:16] <astro76> extrakick, it's most likely something else
[06:16] <joanki> now i need to find a prettier color than this orange
[06:16] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Having said that, I've not used the Vista partition in about 6 months
[06:16] <chowmeined> limecat: i dont remember the term now.. but basically i have a bunch of 10GB raw images.. that are mostly empty
[06:16] <joanki> wow
[06:16] <FX_> This is cool. I just installed ubuntu on my macbook pro and it runs llike a champ
[06:17] <chowmeined> limecat: and it stores only the used space
[06:17] <Wolf23> jrib:  now first what can i do?
[06:17] <joanki> cooooooool
[06:17] <joanki> i love it!
[06:17] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, this doesn't happen when i use the feisty livecd
[06:17] <d|v> ntfs partition
[06:17] <chowmeined> limecat: so i have 12 copies of that image in like.. 9GB
[06:17] <arang2> i had gkrellm installed on feisty i updated it and dissappeared from the menu list in gutsy but it's still there, i created an entry on the meny under gutsy but its as if i wasnt doing anything at all anyone got an idea what might have been happening?

[06:17] <freaker> tnx
[06:17] <jrib> Wolf23: what the wiki page says for you to do
[06:17] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: I can run the Windows apps I need using Wine, the Windows support layer for Linux
[06:17] <dizy> does anyone know if the precomiple kernel has 1k speed selected for nic
[06:17] <limecat> chowmeined: ive heard it  unstable compared to ext3.....also, one last question-i can set the disk up as 1gb /boot, the rest LVM'd, and then later decide i want a windows partition, and shrink the LVM?
[06:17] <juan_> hello all!
[06:17] <Falstius> agwells: texmaker is so limiting, and no preview function :(
[06:17] <Spisters> so no one else had a problem with minimizing windows?
[06:17] <extrakick> astro76 even though i didnt have these freezing problems before i installed AcetoneISO2 + its kde depencies?
[06:17] <juan_> how can i enable widescreen on gusty?
[06:17] <Lustblader> wine + utorrent : wine + foobar ---> winar!!
[06:18] <Allenwr> Anyone here have a boot manager recomendation?
[06:18] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: And for other situations I use a Virtual Machine guest that has Windows XP installed (I use that for compatibility testing)
[06:18] <n2diy> optiq: You should be up to date, if you let your update manager run.
[06:18] <Vlet> Wolf23: read what's on this page, and imagine that we were typing it out to you bit by bit. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[06:18] <and_moi> dizy, they're 10/100 by default
[06:18] <chowmeined> limecat: i believe you can shrink the whole LVM physical volume.. but ive never done
[06:18] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, oh, I don't know what is going on, does fdisk find the partition data ?
[06:18] <arghh2d2> nrdb: i guess all i have to do is figure out the correct menu.lst entry to put in and it should work shouldnt it?
[06:18] <smy1220> Some help please?
[06:18] <chowmeined> limecat: XFS is actually pretty stable.. and its very fast.. high performance
[06:18] <limecat> ...i suppose ill set aside a few hundred megs
[06:18] <optiq> n2diy: yea I'm up to date but I was just wondering if theres anything I'm missing
[06:18] <Lustblader> !ask | smy1220
[06:18] <ubotu> smy1220: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[06:18] <Wolf23> jrib:  i cant see anything for amd64 x86?
[06:18] <smy1220> Clean install of Gusty. open terminal type sudo gconf-editor ot to apps->nautilis->desktop heck off the: Computer, Trash, Network icons and nothing!!!! Reboot does not solve it!!! Is 7.10 using a different location for this setting?
[06:18] <chowmeined> limecat: im sure you can resize it offline
[06:18] <limecat> chowmeined: so /home youd recommend XFS?
[06:18] <nrdb> arghh2d2, I think so, but I couldn't work out what that was.
[06:18] <smy1220> !ask
[06:18] <jrib> Wolf23: you are running feisty amd64 now correct?
[06:19] <chowmeined> limecat: i actually have a separate logical volume just for vmachine images
[06:19] <Wolf23> Vlet:  like i say, i need for amd64?
[06:19] <limecat> i see
[06:19] <Wolf23> jrib:  yes
[06:19] <chowmeined> limecat: so i dont have to copy them around when i reinstall
[06:19] <smy1220> !ask | smy1220 Clean install of Gusty. open terminal type sudo gconf-editor ot to apps->nautilis->desktop heck off the: Computer, Trash, Network icons and nothing!!!! Reboot does not solve it!!! Is 7.10 using a different location for this setting?
[06:19] <[chr0n0s]> anyone who can solve this ... when i move windows around, it's jagged motion, i mean not smooth, i am using a ATi Mobility Radeon x2300, with restriced drivers
[06:19] <Lustblader> smy1220: if it is a fresh install.... try again
[06:19] <FX_> bbiab
[06:19] <n2diy> optiq: If your just running a desktop, you should be ok. If your running servers, I can't help you.
[06:19] <[chr0n0s]> anyone who can solve this ... when i move windows around, it's jagged motion, i mean not smooth, i am using a ATi Mobility Radeon x2300, with restricted drivers
[06:19] <limecat> i like the stability of ext3, i have had to hard-reset my comp a few times, and any time i tuned the journaling to be faster, i lost data
[06:19] <hendrixski> BlaenkDenum, k, yeah, those links said to go to the restricted drivers manager and select ATI... which isn't an option in my checkbox
[06:19] <joanki> virutal machine guest
[06:19] <smy1220> 2nd instsll
[06:19] <arghh2d2> nrdb grubs man page isnt very helpful is it?
[06:19] <joanki> man complicated computer u got there
[06:19] <jrib> Wolf23: then the instructions are the same, there is nothing special about amd64 for upgrades
[06:19] <dizy> and_moi ... could you at least point me to where i can find out about changing to 1k
[06:19] <limecat> with default settings, i dont lose data with ext3
[06:19] <Vlet> Wolf23: if you're running amd64 now, and you upgrade, it will upgrade using the packages for amd64
[06:19] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: it doesn't show a terminal method?
[06:19] <eido> how do you extract an archive to directories under /user with the GUI
[06:19] <joanki> how can i get wine?
[06:20] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: could you link me?
[06:20] <Lustblader> arghh2d2: the menu.lst is simpler and easier
[06:20] <IntuitiveNipple> smy1220: I've just enabled those settings and the icons appeared on the Desktop immediately
[06:20] <joanki> you mean i can TOTALLY ditch windows?
[06:20] <limecat> joanki: www.winehq.com
[06:20] <optiq> n2diy: k thanks. I'm running a desktop now but I eventually want to run a server
[06:20] <joanki> if i have wine????
[06:20] <hendrixski> BlaenkDenum, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[06:20] <Spisters> joanki, maybe
[06:20] <Lustblader> joanki: sudo apt-get install wine
[06:20] <limecat> joanki: no, not necessarally
[06:20] <sledmouth> hey, cannot get flash to work with pulse on amd64 with 7.10
[06:20] <nrdb> arghh2d2, there are a lot of controls for it.
[06:20] <Vlet> !wine | joanki
[06:20] <ubotu> joanki: WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information, and see !AppDB for application compatibility.
[06:20] <Spisters> not ALL programs are supported
[06:20] <astro76> extrakick, I would tend to go with the problem being the AcetoneIso2 program which is not from the Ubuntu repos, as opposed to the KDE stuff which is
[06:20] <chowmeined> limecat: thats fair.. XFS can lose data from power loss.. it'd be good to have a UPS
[06:20] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: It depends on the applications you *need* but I'm a power user and I've been able to
[06:20] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: theres a man page for menu.lst
[06:20] <smy1220> exit
[06:20] <arghh2d2> ?
[06:20] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: just follow the instructions for feisty
[06:20] <astro76> extrakick, how did you install it?
[06:20] <Reng> hey guys im planning to use my external 1tb harddrive to store large media. is it better to leave the drive as ntfs or just reformat it as fat32? what you guys think?
[06:20] <limecat> joanki: wine is an approximation of what windows can do, its not perfect.  Check their site before assuming :)
[06:20] <juan_> anyone? how to enable widescreen?
[06:20] <Lustblader> arghh2d2: yes.. what do you wanna do???
[06:20] <n2diy> optiq: Roger, search the forums on ubuntu.com, you should find guidance there.
[06:21] <|sparr|> 856 upgraded, 23 newly installed, 3 to remove and 4 not upgraded.  <-- wish me luck
[06:21] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: be sure to stop when it starts giving instructions on how to do it for edgy haha
[06:21] <Wolf23> jrib: so here i click Version: 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) <-- is it?
[06:21] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Hence why I use a Virtual Machine with Windows XP installed in it, for those times when I have to use Windows... saves dula-booting
=== |sparr| is now known as sparr
[06:21] <and_moi> dizy, default is 10/100 Mbps...you want 1kps or 1000Mbps?
[06:21] <optiq> thanks again
[06:21] <chowmeined> Reng: can fat32 even support 1TB?
[06:21] <arun_> juan_: what video card do you have?
[06:21] <joanki> where do i get a virtual machine
[06:21] <dizy> 1000Mbps
[06:21] <hendrixski> BlaenkDenum, alrighty, not sure how compatible the feisty and edgy things are
[06:21] <extrakick> astro76, i double click the .deb but i then uninstalled it via synaptic pakacge manager
[06:21] <nrdb> Reng, I dont think you can have a 1TB fat32 partition.
[06:21] <Vlet> joanki: virtual box
[06:21] <BlaenkDenum> joanki: what do you mean
[06:21] <Wolf23> Vlet:  i dont like to confuse friend, just what i need is anyone tell me how to make it
[06:21] <joanki> i dunno whwat that is
[06:21] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: I want grub to boot a small partition that is holding my 7.10 iso
[06:21] <joanki> a virtual machine
[06:21] <sledmouth> hey, cannot get flash to work with pulse on amd64 with 7.10
[06:21] <IcemanV9> juan_: just pick a different resolution (widescreen one)
[06:21] <Lustblader> joanki: vmware.com or sudo apt-get install wine
[06:21] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: it's not that, it's just a terminal method
[06:21] <racarter> is there a repository for acroread?
[06:21] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: so the same applies, it's not that you're actually running a feisty program on gutsy
[06:21] <eido> how do you extract an archive to directories under /usr with the GUI
[06:21] <jrib> Wolf23: yes
[06:21] <fiXXXerMe1> Where can I find information about the partition options sync, noatime, nodev and notail?
[06:22] <joanki> and what is all this sudu business
[06:22] <Blu3> i have 7.10 with 2.6.22-14-generic.  i just got a usb cellular card.  i need to modify the airprime module to add it's USB IDs.  what package(s) do i need to install so i have the source matching the current kernel?
[06:22] <Vlet> Wolf23: the instructions are already written out on the page we linked you to
[06:22] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: it's just a different installation method
[06:22] <chowmeined> racarter: medibuntu
[06:22] <joanki> too much to learn
[06:22] <tovella> joanki: one of my favorites is VirtualBox, but everyone has there favorite.
[06:22] <Vantage13> can anyone help me get nm-applet to ask me for my keyring passphrase again?
[06:22] <BlaenkDenum> hendrixski: besides your card's kinda old :P
[06:22] <Lustblader> arghh2d2: do you know where the small partion is?? as in hd1,o etc etc??
[06:22] <joanki> every thing you guys say i am typing down
[06:22] <joanki> to research
[06:22] <Reng> i have 2x 500gb array. should i do fat32 or ntfs for media??
[06:22] <joanki> =)
[06:22] <Spisters> na joanki just keep at it
[06:22] <hendrixski> err, wait no... they are the same for gutsy and feisty.... it says to go to the restricted modules thingy, which doesn't work
[06:22] <juan_> the intel chip that comes with my MB
[06:22] <n2diy> fiXXXerMe1: on grubs man page?
[06:22] <Vlet> joanki: pace yourself :)
[06:22] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: There's a package called QEMU that emulates a PC, and can use hardware support if the PC's CPU has it to make it faster, or there's the commerical VMWare or there's VirtualBox etc
[06:22] <Spisters> you'll get it
[06:22] <KI4IKL> How do I install compiz themes?
[06:22] <BlaenkDenum> Reng: Fat32 would be too slow, it'll make a waste of that raid array
[06:22] <Lustblader> how do i shoot web?
[06:23] <n2diy> KI4IKL: QSL?
[06:23] <Vlet> KI4IKL: install the 'compiz' package to get the control panel to do it
[06:23] <Lustblader> sorry couldn't resist
[06:23] <oxeimon> does anyone here have a dual monitor setup working on an ATI graphics card on 7.10?
[06:23] <and_moi> dizy, some WAN drivers are already 1000Mbps...easiest thing is to check your kernel config (zcat /proc/config.gz > /some/file) to see if your driver is already at 1000mbps. Basically, if there's a driver available and your hardware's capable of it, it's already enabled
[06:23] <BlaenkDenum> Lustblader: stick your middle finger into your wrist and yell 'shoot web!'
[06:23] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: i know the small partition is called hda8 according to the results of command: fdisk -l
[06:23] <limecat> chowmeined: btw, when is ext3 or XFS getting awesome permissions like ntfs >:(
[06:23] <Spisters> so is Byrol (however you spell it) dead in the watter with this build?
[06:23] <joanki> um.... what chat client are you linux users using to access irc?
[06:23] <joanki> i want it
[06:23] <sledmouth> sound in flash anyone? (amd64 with pulse-audio)
[06:23] <joanki> i'm using xchat but i think that is windows based
[06:23] <BlaenkDenum> joanki: xchat
[06:23] <limecat> i like my extended permissions :(
[06:23] <jumbers> So since XMMS has been discontinued, what am I supposed to use?
[06:23] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If the CPU supports hardware VT, then there's a package called "kvm" that uses it (kvm is a customised qemu that uses the hardware VT)
[06:23] <joanki> oh cool!
[06:23] <Vlet> joanki: I use irssi. it's a terminal based client
[06:23] <KI4IKL> n2diy, EM63 AL
[06:23] <chowmeined> limecat: actually they have had those for a long time
[06:23] <tovella> joanki: i like Pidgin.
[06:23] <Madpilot> Spisters, you mean Beryl? it's merged back with compiz
[06:23] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: xchat
[06:23] <n2diy> joanki: gnome-chat here.
[06:23] <BlaenkDenum> joanki: you'll prefer xchat, trust me
[06:23] <Lustblader> arghh2d2: then find the id of the partion with in the HD hd8 is the name of the whole hd
[06:23] <eido> joanki: xchat\
[06:23] <joanki> ok i m gonna use what intuitive uses
[06:23] <chowmeined> limecat: i dont use them cause it adds complexity for me but.. you can set them up
[06:24] <Spisters> will compiz work with this build?
[06:24] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: pencil and paper? :p
[06:24] <juan_> IcemanV9: the intel chip that comes with my MB
[06:24] <chowmeined> limecat: they are called POSIX ACLs
[06:24] <limecat> chowmeined: really?  theyre not quite as useful @ home, but in the work place, i love em
[06:24] <oxeimon> Does anyone have dual monitors working w/ ATI radeon graphics card on 7.10?
[06:24] <joanki> and for programmers, what is the best compiler and debugger for linux
[06:24] <joanki> is valgrind ok?
[06:24] <n2diy> KI4IKL: RR, FN20bt here.
[06:24] <limecat> chowmeined: thanks, ill look into it o.0
[06:24] <bruenig> joanki, gcc
[06:24] <joanki> i heard there was a compiler called gcd or something
[06:24] <chowmeined> limecat: its just a mount time option
[06:24] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: you lost me there
[06:24] <arun_> is it safe to upgrade now? are the servers still flooded?
[06:24] <limecat> oh wow o.0 thanks
[06:24] <nrdb> Reng, are you going to be access the external drive from Windows ?
[06:24] <chowmeined> limecat: then you can use them um.. setfacl tool to set them
[06:24] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: the GNU tools which come as standard to build Linux apps
[06:25] <IcemanV9> juan_: yes. are you on gutsy? laptop or desktop?
[06:25] <bruenig> is there anything other than gcc I wonder
[06:25] <limecat> chowmeined: awesome
[06:25] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: valgrind is for testing programs for leaks etc
[06:25] <tovella> joanki: best compiler?  you'll get at least 100 or so answers for that.
[06:25] <joanki> yes i need valgrind
[06:25] <alien18> anyone know a website i can upload a pgp public key for a friend to download please?
[06:25] <chowmeined> limecat: also there are some extra options you can do with setattr.. things like sticky and append only
[06:25] <juan_> yes, gusty, desktop
[06:25] <joanki> i had to reformat my laptop today beause i had a meory leak from a bad program i wrote ;)
[06:25] <chowmeined> limecat: those are standard
[06:25] <Ashfire908> can i get bzip2 to show the progress of it compressing a file?
[06:25] <Spisters> arun I just got done with mine, seemed to work fine
[06:25] <Lustblader> arghh2d2: can you pm?
[06:25] <eido> how do you extract an archive to directories under /usr with the GUI
[06:25] <limecat> ill take a look, all good stuff
[06:25] <joanki> debuggers are a MUST when using dynamic memory!!!!  arrrr
[06:25] <Reng> <nrdb> im planning to use the external for my linux system
[06:25] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: I use Eclipse + CDT as my IDE for Linux kernel development, app development, as well as for Java and other development
[06:25] <KI4IKL> Vlet, i'm in gusty and "compiz" is installed
[06:25] <joanki> GBU tools....
[06:25] <chowmeined> limecat: http://www.suse.de/~agruen/acl/linux-acls/online/
[06:25] <limecat> off to play with my partitions! hooray for juggling all of my data!
[06:26] <joanki> you like those intuitive?
[06:26] <arun_> Spister: Was it very slow? Everything works after the upgrade?
[06:26] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: i think so
[06:26] <Nuked> Hi. monitor refuses to display 1440x900 even though I entered syncs in manually... gutsy/intel i915
[06:26] <Ashfire908> eido, why are you trying to, and you would need to use sudo to do that, i think you shouldn't sudo gui programs
[06:26] <joanki> or you gotta use them cuz everyone at work does
[06:26] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: i responded to your pm
[06:26] <wasabi_> how do i make the title bar font smaller?
[06:26] <nrdb> Reng, if you aren't using Windows at all, I would look at formatting it ext3
[06:26] <Nuked> can anyone help?
[06:26] <Lustblader> then pm me arghh2d2
[06:26] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, i can even manually mount a partition :S
[06:26] <Vlet> KI4IKL: oh, I meant to say 'emerald'
[06:26] <IcemanV9> juan_: okay. system> pref > resolution ... pick the widescreen size
[06:26] <Spisters> I have to admit, it was slow, and now my screens won't minimize though that might be because of my system, not because of the distro
[06:26] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: i did
[06:27] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Usually you start by installing "build-essential" and add things like "gettext" "autoconf" "automake" and various other support tools and libraries
[06:27] <Ashfire908> eido, though i'm not sure about if it's ok to sudo a gui program
[06:27] <juan_> IcemanV9: gusty, desktop
[06:27] <Reng> <nrdb>is ext3 fat32?
[06:27] <n2diy> Ashfire908: gksudo.
[06:27] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, don't know whats wrong.
[06:27] <joanki> hey intuitive, my ubuntu can't access the internet?  do i need to do something to make it connect?
[06:27] <Adam> is there a way to scan for new hardware devices like USB drives?
[06:27] <limecat> heh, wish live cd had LVM options, guess i gotta reboot :\
[06:27] <joanki> oops
[06:27] <joanki> never mind =p
[06:27] <Lustblader> Reng:  no
[06:27] <drama1981> !ati
[06:27] <ShakaGoldSaint> nrdb, that makes two of us, thanks for the help
[06:27] <nrdb> Reng, ext3 and fat32 are very different.
[06:27] <joanki> haha i guess choosing the network would be the answer
[06:27] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[06:27] <Ashfire908> n2diy, does it put it in a restriced enviroment or something?
[06:28] <eido> Ashfire908: I needed to extract alien arena to /usr/local/games I was wondering if there was a way to directly extract using the GUI instead of extracting to home folder and then moving with terminal and changing permissions
[06:28] <arghh2d2> Lustblader: i tried to pm you
[06:28] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: Eclipse is great for my kernel dev work - it hands the entire kernel tree effortlessly, and sometimes I have multiple kernel versions open at once so thats 10,000's of files indexed/managed
[06:28] <n2diy> ! gksudo | Ashfire908
[06:28] <ubotu> Ashfire908: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using « sudo <GUI-application> » - See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo for more info
[06:28] <Wolf23> jrib: Click the Check button to check for new updates. , A message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release. <--- it doesnot appear any message, but it click on install updates
[06:28] <joanki> wow
[06:28] <joanki> maybe when i graduate i will come work for ubuntu =)
[06:28] <Lustblader> arghh2d2: you need to register on this server to pm... /msg nickserv register password email
[06:28] <Reng> <nrdb>will window able to read ext3?
[06:28] <Lustblader> Reng:  No
[06:28] <Spisters> what are you studying joanki?
[06:28] <Ashfire908> eido, see the ubotu message that was sent to me
[06:28] <nrdb> ShakaGoldSaint, I have heard that windows can screw the partition table, if a small partition is used for windows.
[06:28] <arun_> Spister: what do you mean your screens won't minimise
[06:28] <Lustblader> brb.. need to restart
[06:28] <joanki> programming
[06:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: It's got the Internet now?
[06:29] <Spisters> when I try to minimize them they just close
[06:29] <joanki> yup i just had to choose the network
[06:29] <Spisters> it sucks
[06:29] <eido> Ashfire908: thanks already checking it outs
[06:29] <joanki> i like it it's so easy to use
[06:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: makes sense :)
[06:29] <Spisters> what school do you go to joanki?
[06:29] <nrdb> Reng, I believe there is a driver for windows that handles ext3, don't know anything about it thou.
[06:29] <Adam> is there a way to scan for new hardware devices like USB drives?
[06:29] <jrib> Wolf23: install those first
[06:29] <chowmeined> limecat: i think you can install the tools on the livecd.. if you just wanna try it out
[06:29] <Reng> <Lustblader> oic. im planning to share the drive with window on my network
[06:29] <Ashfire908> is there a progress bar for bzip2?
[06:29] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: If you like exploring and testing software, use Synaptic to browse the 10,000's of applications and packages that Ubuntu provides
[06:29] <Wolf23> jrib:  click on install updates?
[06:30] <joanki> hmmmm that would fall in the tmi category spisters
[06:30] <jrib> Wolf23: yes
[06:30] <melinate_> hey folks, anyone know about changes to Apache 2?  after updating to Gusty it is not loading Trac anymore [which uses lib_cgi]
[06:30] <nrdb> Adam, have you had a look at the output of dmesg ?
[06:30] <IntuitiveNipple> joanki: System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager
[06:30] <joanki> ok
[06:30] <limecat> chowmeined: not too worried, i got the alt cd here, and spent an hour or so learning it
[06:30] <Spisters> depends, I'm fine saying I go to Michigan State University
[06:30] <Adam> nrdb: no, will do now
[06:30] <Wolf23> jrib:  o it takes 1:35 minutes

[06:30] <joanki> i had a crappy programming week at school - so i rewarded myself by giving myself a whole day to install linux

[06:32] <drama1981> limecat the oem option will let you run the system and set everything up the way you want it. when you are done you execute a certain command (i cant remember what it is though) then shut down. when its restarted it asks the user to make a user name ect. then its as though the system was just installed with all the apps and settings you made

[06:42] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> I bought it like that BTW

[06:49] <craig22> poningru: i just use them in amarok, so would they load fast still? on ext3
[06:49] <poningru> brad016: install the compiz configuration thing
[06:49] <poningru> craig22: yeah dude
[06:49] <Jordan_U> brad016, Have you tried right clicking on the bottom right panel applet and adding more?
[06:50] <craig22> poningru: im at just under 100,00
[06:50] <riotkittie> brad016: do you have ccsm installed? if not, go to System > Appearances, and you should be able to increase the # on one of the tabs there
[06:50] <poningru> Jordan_U: does not work if you have compiz
[06:50] <craig22> poningru: 100,000
[06:50] <wubuntu> does anybody know how to make the thinkpad-buttons working
[06:50] <poningru> craig22: yeah that shouldnt be a problem
[06:50] <poningru> assuming number of files
[06:51] <craig22> poningru: ya, ok cool thanks
[06:51] <riotkittie> i cant believe  he waited like 20 secs between "any help?" and /quit
[06:51] <poningru> wubuntu: yeah search for thinkpad on wiki.ubuntu.com depending on your model its different
[06:51] <Jordan_U> I am getting this error upgrading to Gutsy, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41272/ it doesn't go away no matter how many times I say yes, should I say no?
[06:51] <poningru> Jordan_U: looking
[06:52] <wubuntu> poningru: yeah, i know, but normally 'hotkey-setup' configures ist - don't wanna use 'tpb'
[06:52] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> What would I be able to do?
[06:52] <[chr0n0s]> what do install mysql-server-5.0 or mysql-server, what is the difference ??
[06:52] <extrakick> is gutsy kind aunstable at the mo, i see there are alot of prob popping up here
[06:52] <Ashfire908> how can i check how long a file is in blocks
[06:52] <poningru> Jordan_U: is that with update-manager?
[06:52] <Jordan_U> poningru, Yes
[06:52] <poningru> extrakick: we had similar during feisty
[06:53] <zakman> whts linux equivalent of chkdsk LETTER?
[06:53] <Lustblader> extrakick: it's beta and it's new.. so expected stuff all this
[06:53] <Jordan_U> poningru, I also have apt-listbugs installed, but I don't think this is that
[06:53] <riotkittie> Lustblader: it's not beta
[06:53] <poningru> zakman: fsck
[06:53] <adrifi> /server irc.webchat.org
[06:53] <ferromag> is it really possible to enable/disable hdd DMA?
[06:53] <zakman> thx
[06:53] <poningru> Jordan_U: before you do that
[06:53] <Ashfire908> zakman, fsck DEVICE
[06:53] <IntuitiveNipple> [chr0n0s]: mysql-server is a meta-package that will install the recommended mysql-server version when there is more than one version in the repositories
[06:53] <zakman> device being /dev/hd_?
[06:53] <poningru> do a sudo apt-get update
[06:53] <poningru> and then sudo apt-get upgrade
[06:53] <wubuntu> poningru: yeah, i know, but normally 'hotkey-setup' configures ist - don't wanna use 'tpb'
[06:53] <iStiKs> no problems here with gutsy even got my theme to work properly off the bat
[06:53] <Madpilot> ferromag, yes, but Ubuntu should have that set properly
[06:54] <poningru> wubuntu: oh dont know what to tell you dude
[06:54] <Jordan_U> poningru, I am in the middle of the upgrade :)
[06:54] <sledmouth> Ashfire908: ls -s ?
[06:54] <ferromag> anytime I've tried all I got was Inproper ioctl for device...
[06:54] <wubuntu> s***
[06:54] <limecat> sledmouth: depends on your budget, what you like, and if youd use it for other things
[06:54] <extrakick> poninfru, lustblader, ok kool, im new to linux, i thought new ubuntu wouldnt be released unless very stable
[06:54] <Jordan_U> poningru, No package has been installed yet, but I don't think that it is a good idea to just quit
[06:54] <vali> Hi... is there any way to change the default amarok behaviour when double-click a playlist?
[06:55] <poningru> vali: you might have better help in #kubuntu
[06:55] <vali> uhmm... youre right :P
[06:55] <Ubuntu101> extrakick its stable
[06:55] <SharkMa-san> maybe you should try #amarok instead lol
[06:55] <vali> i forgot about #kubuntu
[06:55] <iStiKs> stable here
[06:55] <zakman> stable here
[06:55] <Phlosten> stable there
[06:55] <vali> in #amarok all ppl seems to sleep xD
[06:55] <Sir_Sid> why am I getting a message telling me to upgrade my distrobution to gutsy if I am using gutsy in the first place...
[06:55] <Jordan_U> Not upgrading here ;)
[06:56] <xIke_> ok, I tried editing my xorg.conf to add more buttons, but no luck.  clearly 4/5 are scroll up/down, but I can't seem to get results from 6/7
[06:56] <poningru> anyone sticking around for halp?
[06:56] <sledmouth> can't tell much from 5 hour uptime...
[06:56] <IntuitiveNipple> extrakick: There are a lways problems, whether issues to do with hardware config, user-misunderstanding, or previous configuration settings confusing updates. You have to remember that people generally don't come here to report a success, only a problem :)
[06:56] <extrakick> ubuntu101, but about all thee problems all these users are running into?
[06:56] <zakman> jordan.. your using gnome 2.18?
[06:56] <SharkMa-san> vali: well, at least they answer... :P
[06:56] <riotkittie> Sir_Sid: did you install a beta? a rc?
[06:56] <poningru> xIke_: use the command xev test
[06:56] <SharkMa-san> when they're around
[06:56] <Sir_Sid> riotkittie, nope. Torrented the the actual gutsy distro
[06:56] <Jordan_U> Sir_Sid, What does "lsb_release -a" say you are running?
[06:56] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> So, what could I do: Iphone in Virtual Box?
[06:56] <extrakick> very true intuitivenipple
[06:56] <Adam> anyone know of a way to mount norton ghost .v2i drives in ubuntu?
[06:56] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> It connected the very first time when I did it for like 10 sec then stopped. . .
[06:57] <Sir_Sid> Distributor ID: Ubuntu
[06:57] <Sir_Sid> Description:    Ubuntu 7.10
[06:57] <Sir_Sid> Release:        7.10
[06:57] <Sir_Sid> Codename:       gutsy
[06:57] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> That was like yesterday. .
[06:57] <ubuntu> buenas noches
[06:57] <akaishi> gah, I managed to blow away x
[06:57] <BlaenkDenum> I'm trying to mount my windows partition but it says I don't have the privilege to do it, what should I do?
[06:57] <wubuntu> why the ralink drivers don't work correctly in the new kernel? >:o
[06:57] <Flynsarmy> What's the difference between the gutsy alternative iso and the regular iso?
[06:58] <xIke_> poningru, ok, it thinks my right two buttons are also 4/5, and doesn't even see my left two buttons
[06:58] <poningru> akaishi: what do you mean blow it away?
[06:58] <Jordan_U> I am getting this error upgrading to Gutsy, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41272/ it doesn't go away no matter how many times I say yes, should I say no?
[06:58] <Sir_Sid> BlaenkDenum, type sudo before you mount
[06:58] <PurpZeY> BlaenkDenum: How are you trying to mount it?
[06:58] <xIke_> poningru, nothing registers as 6/7
[06:58] <riotkittie> wubuntu: can you elaborate?
[06:58] <poningru> xIke_: ooh that sucks
[06:58] <ubuntu> somebody speak spanish..??
[06:58] <biotrox> enouf where r u..?
[06:58] <Sir_Sid> BlaenkDenum, you may want to edit fstab to auto mount at boot
[06:58] <BlaenkDenum> PurpZeY: GUI, just going into the drive and it automatically tries to mount
[06:58] <poningru> !es | ubuntu
[06:58] <[chr0n0s]> thanks IntuitiveNipple
[06:58] <ubotu> ubuntu: Si busca ayuda en Español por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, allí obtendrá mas ayuda.
[06:58] <akaishi> I did a dist-upgrade to (theoretically) edgy, and when the machine restarted, x failed to run
[06:58] <BlaenkDenum> I added my line to fstab, how can I apply the mount right now?
[06:58] <Cable86> Flynsarmy: the regular iso boots into a graphical environment, the alternate iso is simply a text-based installer
[06:58] <BlaenkDenum> Sir_Sid:
[06:58] <extrakick> i was ready to upgrade to gutsy but wen i tried live my card wouldnt do desktop effects, so that really put me off, hahaha
[06:58] <xIke_> poningru, lol
[06:58] <riotkittie> Jordan_U: if "yes" isnt getting you anywhere, and you've done it repeatedly, then perhaps it's time you went with no
[06:58] <BlaenkDenum> Sir_Sid: I added the line to fstab, what's the command to re-mount or mount the drives?
[06:58] <Jordan_U> extrakick, What card?
[06:59] <poningru> xIke_: dude what model is it?
[06:59] <wubuntu> riotkittie: rt61pci crashes using synaptic/apt-get!
[06:59] <Flynsarmy> Is there any difference between the CD and DVD releases? Do DVD contain more packages?
[06:59] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> What would I do people?
[06:59] <Sir_Sid> hmm I actually forgot that one
[06:59] <poningru> you may wanna search google
[06:59] <and_moi> BlaenkDenum, mount 0a
[06:59] <Neil3> hey folks
[06:59] <extrakick> rdeon 9550, as far as i know it blacklisted for some reason
[06:59] <xIke_> poningru, razer diamondback
[06:59] <BlaenkDenum> mount -a, thanks and_moi
[06:59] <PurpZeY> BlaenkDenum: I've never done it that way...I just use NTS read
[06:59] <and_moi> BlaenkDenum, sorry, mount -a
[06:59] <riotkittie> wubuntu: lovely :( file a bug report?
[06:59] <akaishi> so I've kind of got no idea now
[06:59] <Cable86> Flynsarmy: yes, the dvd images contain more packages
[06:59] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> google provides no help. . .
[06:59] <extrakick> jordan_u, but it works fine here on 7.04
[06:59] <PurpZeY> NFS*
[06:59] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, Well, no packages have actually been installed yet, so there is the third choice of backing out entirely and avoiding possible brickage :)
[06:59] <wubuntu> yeah, there is a bugreport for few weeks
[06:59] <IcemanV9> Flynsarmy: dvd = livecd + alternative altogether
[07:00] <riotkittie> Jordan_U:  option #3 might be for the best
[07:00] <drama1981> Flynsarmy dvd has more packages. they arent installed by default though. if you go to install something thats on the dvd it will ask for the disc instead of making you d/l it
[07:00] <arun_> Has anyone installed the Gnash plugin for Firefox?
[07:00] <Ubuntu101> extrakick: well most of them are just normal problems with how to use various applications. Installing linux (what IntuitiveNipple was doing earlier) is always a hurdle, especially if you want to mess with partitions
[07:00] <Ubuntu101> Others are drive problems, but I'm not seeing anything here such as it crashing computers or anything ;)
[07:00] <riotkittie> weird that it is doing that to you. hmmm.
[07:00] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, :(
[07:00] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> So what can I do?
[07:00] <Neil3> just musing over this: i'm thinking about installing the 64bit version of ubuntu on my dell inspiron 6400 laptop, but is it worth it in terms of any performance benefits?
[07:00] <wubuntu> why they can't fix it? that'S not what i expected from Ubuntu
[07:00] <poningru> arun_: yes
[07:00] <BlaenkDenum> yeah, I just can't mount
[07:01] <arun_> poningru: Does it work well for you?
[07:01] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, It is also saying "The following 6 packages will be pinned or on hold: gij-4.2, libglade2-ruby1.8, ghostscript, libdb4.5, libpcrecpp0, texlive-latex-base"
[07:01] <iStiKs> BlaenkDenum: sudo mount /dev/... /media/..
[07:01] <IntuitiveNipple> Neil3: I've been running 64-bit since June with no problems, in fact I've been pleasantly surprised by the application support compared to Feisty
[07:01] <poningru> Neil3: eh not really, especially if you like using proprietry stuff
[07:01] <poningru> arun_: well enough
[07:01] <BlaenkDenum> seems to be working now nevermind
[07:01] <poningru> arun_: some flash sites still wont work
[07:01] <BlaenkDenum> iStiKs: obviously not what I meant :P
[07:01] <poningru> youtube works
[07:01] <extrakick> ubuntu101, my bad i gues im just annoyed my card is blacklisted, lol
[07:01] <Neil3> poningru, all i can think of that i use which is proprietary is java
[07:01] <poningru> and similar sites work most of the time
[07:01] <wers> my openoffice.org's full screen mode can't be untoggled. what configuration file can I edit for that?
[07:01] <poningru> ...
[07:01] <arun_> anyone know how to disable the ugly right click menu for flash files?
[07:01] <poningru> Neil3: thats not propreitry anymore
[07:01] <arun_> disable = change its appearance to look more like gnome
[07:02] <poningru> arun_: use gnash ;)
[07:02] <Neil3> and gnash i've heard works pretty well?
[07:02] <Jordan_U> extrakick, Does X restart when you run "glxinfo"? ( don't try it obviously unless you are prepared for X to crash :)
[07:02] <poningru> Neil3: yeah well enough
[07:02] <[chr0n0s]> hey, will sudo aptitude remove xserver-xgl, will uninstall the pre-installed xserver-xgl ???
[07:02] <xIke_> poningru, any ideas?
=== amidanie2 is now known as amidaniel
[07:02] <Cable86> the java version installed by default in 7.10 is still proprietary...the free version is called iced tea and i don't believe it is ready for widespread use yet
[07:02] <poningru> Neil3: yeah you may want to experiment
[07:02] <IntuitiveNipple> Neil3: I use 64-bit + Java 1.6 + Eclipse Europa and it works perfectly
[07:02] <wubuntu> there is a solution: blacklist rt61pci, download and install rt61 from serialmonkey.com - that cannot be the truth - it's like in Debian ETch
[07:02] <poningru> xIke_: just google around to see if anyone has gotten it working before
[07:02] <Blama> Does anyone know wher the actual plugin folder for firefox is? It is not at ~/.mozilla/plugins
[07:02] <Anick> can some one help me with my ati 9800 video card
[07:02] <Cable86> rather, it's not installed by default, but comes with ubuntu-restricted-extras
[07:03] <Neil3> poningru, yeah just testing the water in here before i do, but the more i read, the more i wanna switch!
[07:03] <bone> Anyone (besides me) have a problem installing perl modules (the initial make fails).
[07:03] <poningru> xIke_: apart from that sorry dude
[07:03] <biotrox> !id
[07:03] <ubotu> join ke #ubuntu-id untuk membahas ubuntu dalam bahasa Indonesia
[07:03] <extrakick> jordan_u, u mean in 7.04 or 7.10?
[07:03] <xIke_> poningru, yeah, looking on google already, not optimistic.  thanks man
[07:03] <Jordan_U> extrakick, Either
[07:03] <poningru> xIke_: the problem is your mouse doesnt seem to be sticking to normal standard methods of communicating with the computer
[07:03] <arun_> poningru: you just said gnash doesn't work well on all websites :)
[07:03] <poningru> I am guessing even under windows it required its own drivers
[07:03] <Neil3> poningru, i think it will help myself as I do video/audio transcoding/conversion quite a lot
[07:03] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> Any ideas?
[07:03] <poningru> arun_: right but it works well enough for me
[07:04] <BlaenkDenum> hey guys I opened my windows drive and ubuntu automatically mounted it, but it doesn't show up in fstab, I'm guessing I can't be sure it'll always be automatically mounted?
[07:04] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> I need to unmount the iphone so its like brand new when I connect it again
[07:04] <Anick> is any one having a problem with their ATI 9800 with ubuntu 7.10
[07:04] <sledmouth> does gnash work with games at all?
[07:04] <poningru> BlaenkDenum: that auto mount thing is using gnome's own virtual file system thing
[07:04] <PurpZeY> BlaenkDenum: Why the concern with fstab?
[07:04] <extrakick> jordan_u, do i run that in terminal, sorry to ask im new to linx
[07:04] <arun_> any other way to change the appearance of the flash right click menu?
[07:05] <BlaenkDenum> PurpZeY: because I'm going to system link my firefox bookmarks from windows drive to linux, and I want to make sure it's automatically mounted on boot
[07:05] <Jordan_U> extrakick, Yes, but only if you are prepared to have every GUI app you are currently running possibly quit ;)
[07:05] <poningru> BlaenkDenum: you can make it read writable by you by just changing the ownership of the folder to you
[07:05] <BlaenkDenum> PurpZeY: so what do you guys suggest I do
[07:05] <Blama> Does anyone know wher the actual plugin folder for firefox is? It is not at ~/.mozilla/plugins
[07:05] <poningru> BlaenkDenum: then I would say put into fstab
[07:05] <virtuososteve_> hey
[07:05] <BlaenkDenum> Blama: that folder applies to you heh
[07:05] <poningru> but thats a bit tricky
[07:05] <IntuitiveNipple> BlaenkDenum: Gnome-Mount will automount hot-plugged drives if the option is set. If you want them to always appear on the same mount point then you'd need to add an entry to fstab that uses the device's UUID
[07:05] <virtuososteve_> how can i get ubuntu 7.10?
[07:05] <BlaenkDenum> poningru: but I don't know what I would put in that haha
[07:05] <extrakick> just done
[07:05] <akorn> Does anybody know how to install Beryl on 7.10? I don't like Compiz

[07:06] <extrakick> jordan_u, just done

[07:06] <Blama> BlaenkDenum, I don't have that folder
[07:06] <MASTER_OF_THE_CH> I dont knwo how and where do I go?
[07:06] <akaishi> when I boot x fails to start, and outputs "'^N^E^HS.UTF-8" - any thoughts?
[07:06] <extrakick> jordan_u, shall i paste output?
[07:06] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, Meh, I am going to be an idiot and just say no ( I don't need those packages anyway, I just hope there won't be any dependency problems, and I guess I should just trust apt... )
[07:06] <klos> i have a problem with my memory :-/
[07:06] <klos> http://imageupload.com/~imageupl/show.php/36123_Bildschirmfoto.png.html
[07:06] <BlaenkDenum> Blama: go to irc.mozilla.org #firefox and ask them there, sorry I don't know :( but they're really smart over there
[07:07] <klos> anyone else noticed this on gutsy
[07:07] <klos> ?
[07:07] <poningru> akaishi: try this 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-core'
[07:07] <Gunner_Sr> I have having problems with i8k on gutsy, in that one fan is controllable, the other is at -22 and the fan speed is at 922
[07:07] <poningru> Blama: whats the question?
[07:07] <IntuitiveNipple> BlaenkDenum: here's my fstab as an example: http://pastebin.intuitivenipple.net/79
[07:07] <zetheroo> how happy is everyone?
[07:07] <bone> Ok, now i'm confused. I rewrote my perl cpan config now it makes fine.. hehhe
[07:07] <Jordan_U> extrakick, No, it's just that that is why cards are usually blacklisted, because a check can't be safely done to see if they would support compiz ( I have one such card, a SIS :( )
[07:07] <bone> I'm always happy
[07:07] <Cable86> klos: no, i have not had that problem at all
[07:07] <riotkittie> Jordan_U: i'll keep my fingers crossed for ya
[07:07] <klos> k thx
[07:08] <BlaenkDenum> IntuitiveNipple: thanks, but what information would I need
[07:08] <Anick> Is any one having problems enabling their ATI drivers in the Restricted Driver
[07:08] <BlaenkDenum> IntuitiveNipple: the UUID is CCDC3FAEDC3F9226, it's a Windows XP NTFS formatted partition
[07:08] <akaishi> hmm, claims xserver-core isn't installed
[07:08] <BlaenkDenum> Anick: my friend was
[07:08] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, WTF? I havn't even pressed anything yet and I just got a new error
[07:08] <poningru> akaishi: err hold on
[07:08] <Anick> every time i do my VC goes crazy
[07:08] <IntuitiveNipple> BlaenkDenum: Whilst a device is auto-mounted get its UUID in a terminal by doing "ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid" and copying the UUID to a new fstab entry. Use my fstab as a guide
[07:09] <extrakick> jordan_u, does that mean if glxinfo forced me to restart that would of been a problem, but since it worked then my card should eb ok?
[07:09] <Deformation> anyone can help me please? my external ntfs harddisk is not mounting and now showing up since i updated to gutsy
[07:09] <BlaenkDenum> IntuitiveNipple: under 'mount options' it says 'rw nosuid nodev noatime user_id=0 group_ui=0 allow_other'
[07:09] <IntuitiveNipple> BlaenkDenum: Edit fstab using "gksudo gedit /etc/fstab"
[07:09] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, And this time it is having problems with important packages like openssh-client and server
[07:09] <BlaenkDenum> IntuitiveNipple: right I know, I just don't know how to format the line
[07:09] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, I'm aborting :(
[07:09] <BlaenkDenum> IntuitiveNipple: for example, what options
[07:09] <poningru> akaishi: I meant xserver-xorg-core
[07:10] <r0b--> hi, i seem to have an unsupported video card
[07:10] <poningru> BlaenkDenum: dude I linked you to it...
[07:10] <poningru> wtf

[07:12] <riotkittie> Jordan_U: any chance you have a backup? i have sources.lst sources.lst~ and something else in my directory
[07:13] <riotkittie> BlaenkDenum: you've tried mounting it manually?
[07:13] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, I have a backup, it's just dangerous for users that don't realize that the next application they install after a failed upgrade will basically half upgrade them to Gutsy

[07:14] <poningru> GuHhH: ok gotcha
[07:15] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, Hopefully not many, I think my problem with the upgrade itself may be somewhat my fault ( I have apt-get-listbugs installed )

[07:20] <Vantage13> hi.  After I brought my laptop running gutsy out of hibernate it kept prompting for the gnome-keyring password.  Eventually I hit cancel and the prompt went away.  Since then I have been unable to get wireless going and it no longer prompts me for my gnome-keyring password upon login.  Any idea how I can get this going again?
[07:20] <extrakick> will software that work don 7.10 still work on 7.10?
[07:20] <ActySofts> anyone up to solve some sound problems in xubuntu?
[07:20] <extrakick> i mean worked on 7.04 will still work on 7.10
[07:20] <arang2> Jordan_U: ok lesson learned , do u know any way to control tracker?

[07:21] <Jordan_U> arang2, Control in what way?

[07:25] <riotkittie> josss: you've changed BIOS settings to CD boot? you've checked the md5?
[07:25] <scguy318> josss: have you checked for defects?
[07:25] <todkon> ActySofts: ahh, hmm, well, make sure its disabled in your Bios :P
[07:26] <allobjects> Can someone please help me to make sure my current apt-cacher setup is used when I do an upgrade to 7.10  ?
[07:26] <josss> yeah,already checked
[07:26] <scguy318> josss: what exactly happens when you try to boot
[07:26] <todkon> ActySofts: neither of your soundcards work either though?
[07:26] <todkon> not even on board?
[07:26] <Vantage13> IntuitiveNipple: but I'm still not getting prompted for the keyring and can't get wireless going again...
[07:26] <IntuitiveNipple> Vantage13: Hmm, try hacking through the settings using gconf in the /apps section... I bet there's a gnome setting somewhere doing it
[07:26] <josss> it say cannot view in this display mode
[07:26] <arghh2d2> Can anyone assist me in getting grub to load 7.10 install disk from a partition instead of a cdrom?
[07:26] <lwizardl> can i remove lost+found from a sda drive?
[07:26] <riotkittie> Jordan_U: hopefully it goes much better for you this time around. are the repos still miserably slow?
[07:27] <Blama> Jordan_U, it won't let me check it off
[07:27] <Jordan_U> riotkittie, Not nearly as bad
[07:27] <ActySofts> todkon: yep, and there's no option like that in my bios (I can't make anything out of italian though), but they both work on windoze and they did work before
[07:27] <scguy318> josss: an X error? have you tried safe graphics mode?
[07:27] <Neutrinux> Jordan_U: they are in sources.list.save (what is that? adept manager thing?)
[07:27] <josss> scguy318: no
[07:28] <riotkittie> ahh. i'll have to pop a CD in and try installing to my external later then.
[07:28] <ActySofts> todkon: I'm using xubuntu btw, but I guess it doesn't really matter, the core is the same
[07:28] <DanMulvey> alright, i have a broadcom wireless in my laptop, any advice on getting this thing working?
[07:28] <Jordan_U> Neutrinux, No idea, I just know that other sources can be defined in other files
[07:28] <Blama> Jordan_U, It will not let me download Macromedia Flash Plugin :( I cannot check it off
[07:28] <Neutrinux> Jordan_U: ok thank u

[07:40] <riotkittie> odzk: ok, then right click on your top panel, select new panel
[07:40] <ShouldBeStudyin> ademan.....thanks
[07:40] <joanki> anyone have any idea why irssi not working?
[07:40] <scguy318> spiderskull: try sudo modprobe ndiswrapper? see if its not loaded already
[07:40] <odzk> ok let me try
[07:40] <spiderskull> scguy318: ndiswrapper seems to be loaded -- modprobe -l|grep ndiswrapper gives me a listing
[07:40] <fit4lfe> does anyone one how to change the env variables for feisty so that update-manager can use python modules?
[07:40] <scguy318> spiderskull: mm
[07:40] <jotil> odzk, you already had a top panel? :P
[07:40] <odzk> yup
[07:41] <DanMulvey> any way to make my top and bottom toolbars autohide a little more? (so they dont stick out so much) or am i just being picky
[07:41] <trax_> I ssem to have trouble with starting games. I get an error about framebuffers, but I can't seem to any info on how to install them, and seting vga= via grub hasn't worked either.
[07:41] <odzk> top is there
[07:41] <odzk> this is what i get when i run gnome-panel
[07:41] <spiderskull> scguy318: I just have no indication of WHERE the problem is, so I was hoping there were some debugging flags I could turn on somewhere
[07:41] <jotil> odzk, rule of GUI computing: always right click. everywhere.
[07:41] <scguy318> spiderskull: have you looked in syslog?
[07:41] <spiderskull> scguy318: it could very well be the drivers, but I've tried 2 different sets
[07:41] <tovella> joanki: do you use yahoo, or aim instant messaging, as well?
[07:41] <scguy318> spiderskull: and modprobe -l just lists all the modules
[07:41] <bone> Is there any way to validate if my do-release-upgrade was completely successful?
[07:41] <odzk> I've detected a panel already running,
[07:41] <odzk> and will now exit.
[07:41] <scguy318> spiderskull: not whether they're actually loaded, thats lsmod I believe
[07:41] <allobjects> can someone please point me to documentation on what update-manager does step by step when the upgrade option is taken ?
[07:41] <joanki> no, tovella
[07:41] <joanki> i just downloaded ubuntu and installed it tonight
[07:41] <spiderskull> scguy318: usually I just tail /var/log/messages -- is there something else I should look for
[07:42] <scguy318> spiderskull: /var/log/syslog, dmesg :P
[07:42] <bluebanana> how come i can't get dual-monitor setup working in gutsy?
[07:42] <Jaggs> ok I am new and wondering... if wireless shows as an option at all in my networks does that mean it is recognising my card?
[07:42] <scguy318> spiderskull: System -> Administration -> System Log may be helpful
[07:42] <bluebanana> is it because gutsy doesn't know that I have a video card that can do that?
[07:42] <spiderskull> scguy318: yeah, my mistake.. lsmod does show it, though
[07:42] <odzk> jotil: this is what i get <jotil> odzk, rule of GUI computing: always right click. everywhere.
[07:42] <tux97_> anyone in here playing ut on there linux pc?
[07:42] <spiderskull> scguy318: wait a second... I'm starting to see activity.
[07:42] <Smegzor> I notice a process called trackerd is hogging my cpu for a long time now.  Do I need to worry about it? It seems to be an indexing service of some sort.
[07:42] <joanki> one thing i notice is that when i go to add/remove applications a LOT of applications are NOT available to me
[07:43] <joanki> can anyone hep me get irssi?
[07:43] <trax_> bluebanna: have u installed the drivers for your card?
[07:43] <jotil> bluebanana, i have heard someone say that he had to manually do it. i think Vlet? dual monitor setup?
[07:43] <scguy318> Smergzor: thats exactly it, when it finishes indexing it shouldn't suck up CPU
[07:43] <odzk> riotkittie: this is what i get ie> odzk: ok, then right click on your top panel, select new panel
[07:43] <spiderskull> scguy318: so it seems I just needed to restart; I modprobe'd ndiswrapper and now the light at least turns on
[07:43] <odzk> <joanki> anyone have any idea why irssi not working?
[07:43] <odzk> <odzk> ok let me try
[07:43] <odzk> * darkzero has quit (Client Quit)

[07:43] <odzk> <odzk> yup
[07:43] <odzk> <odzk> top is there
[07:43] <Smegzor> it just stopped now.  its been running for ages.  all good then :)
[07:43] <bone> tritum, i think he accidently pasted that

[07:43] <Ashfire908> is there a program for ubuntu that can defrag a ntfs drive?
[07:43] <joanki> ok
[07:43] <bone> i hate that, been there, done that
[07:43] <jotil> poor guy
[07:43] <kc> greetings all
[07:44] <riotkittie> Ashfire908: no. if you need to defrag NTFS, youre better off doing it in windows
[07:44] <odzk> my window got messed up sorry
[07:44] <spiderskull> hehe... I used to do that pasting thing when I first started; it's the whole right-click thing; if you're not used to it being associated with paste, it happens
[07:44] <bone> us console people have that happen more often :)
[07:44] <tritium> odzk: no sweat
[07:44] <odzk> what i can i do with my bottom panel missing?
[07:44] <trax_> odzk: download UBCD and fix it that way.
[07:44] <tritium> Just muted you to avoid the spam, buddy :)
[07:44] <sorsis> odzk: alt + f2 to run apps
[07:44] <kc> does anyone know why the firefox add-on tab effect wont work with ubuntu??
[07:44] <riotkittie> odzk: right click on the top panel in an empty space, select new panel.
[07:45] <Ashfire908> riotkittie, windows takes hours and then doesn't defrag all of it
[07:45] <jotil> odzk, right click on your top panel and select - add panel
[07:45] <odzk> what is that?
[07:45] <IlanG> Hi all. Is this the right place to get help with 7.10?
[07:45] <spiderskull> scguy318: thanks for your help, by the way
[07:45] <odzk> yup i did
[07:45] <odzk> how can i put the switch window option and the trash?
[07:45] <Smegzor> I finally fixed up my shared folders.  I had to re-add my password to samba after upgrading to 7.10.  Somehow it lost the password.
[07:45] <tritium> IlanG: yes, it is
[07:45] <jotil> odzk, join gnome help channel
[07:45] <sorsis> odzk: UBCD = Ultimate Boot CD
[07:46] <trax_> odsk: Ultimate Boot CD. lets u fix stuffed up computers.
[07:46] <odzk> why do i need the boot cd?
[07:46] <riotkittie> Ashfire908: if windows takes hours to defrag, chances are you're waiting way too long between defrags.
[07:46] <jotil> lol trax_
[07:46] <IlanG> Hi tritium. I'm using a HP laptop. not a new one. with ATI graphic card.
[07:46] <odzk> ok
[07:46] <scguy318> spiderskull: np
[07:46] <kc> also can anyone tell me where i can get a copy of vmware server??
[07:46] <spiderskull> does anyone know if there's progress towards making ndiswrapper easier to deal with for most users on Ubuntu
[07:46] <tritium> IlanG: hi
[07:46] <IlanG> after upgrading to 7.10 (from 7.04) i can't use 1024X768 anymore
[07:46] <Smegzor> knoppix live cd is more newbie friendly.  I have both and rarely fix anything with UBCD
[07:46] <jotil> kc, google: ubuntu vmware
[07:46] <kc> thank you jotil
[07:47] <spiderskull> I mean, I'm more or less saavy, and it took me a while, but I'd like to get involved in making it easier
[07:47] <riotkittie> odzk: right click on the bottom panel > add to panel.  you'll find everything you need in the window that pops up, and you can just drag it to the panel
[07:47] <Ashfire908> riotkittie, so i'm supposed to defrag each week or something?
[07:47] <trax_> I ssem to have trouble with starting games. I get an error about framebuffers, but I can't seem to any info on how to install them, and seting vga= via grub hasn't worked either.
[07:47] <odzk> ok i got it now, thanks for the help
[07:47] <odzk> i think simdock is better
[07:47] <extrakick> i got dual screens and had to do alot of research to edit the xorg file on 7.04, will i need to do the same to get it working on 7.10?
[07:48] <Smegzor> Is there a nicer tool than top for viewing running processes?
[07:48] <IcemanV9> Smegzor: htop
[07:48] <riotkittie> Ashfire908: if your ntfs partition needs it, yes. unless your ntfs partition is abnormally huge, in which case you may want to consider moving none essential files to another partition utilizing another file system.

[08:01] <CookieMonster> does wine lag?
[08:01] <wolfmanz> is there a log file that showes whats been using the nic network card over the last hour?
[08:01] <racarter> that doesn't work for me
[08:02] <racarter> um.. i guess r/w
[08:02] <scguy318> CookieMonster: depends on the app, not rly, im using mIRC on Wine
[08:02] <CookieMonster> umm
[08:02] <CookieMonster> fl studio?

[08:05] <IlanG> Iceman: but it is

[08:08] <racarter> ntfs-config put this mount in /etc/fstab
[08:08] <racarter> but i still cant seem to access it
[08:08] <IlanG> IcemanV9: It's not.
[08:09] <racarter> i was able to access my windows drive from knoppix so i think the drive is still valid..
[08:09] <racarter> but of course i cant boot vista anymore.. which is a separate problem i guess
[08:09] <jotil> mythtv perhaps? which installation should i go for if i want to watch TV and perhaps record stuff from time to time?
[08:09] <ckw__> jotil:What TV card are you using?
[08:09] <nemik> so any way to make gnome's calendar/time start on mondays and not sundays?
[08:09] <novato_br> hi, is there emulator for Wii ?
[08:09] <jimmy_> why isnt emerald in add.remove  applications?
[08:09] <iStiKs> racarter: did you mount it
[08:09] <racarter> i cant seem to
[08:09] <riotkittie> Jordan_U: ugh. i wonder what thats all about :|
[08:09] <crazytime> anyone have an idead of why the 7.10 alt install is telling me "the CD_ROM does not seem to contain a valid 'Release' file"?
[08:10] <iStiKs> racarter: try sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/ntfs
[08:10] <racarter> the result of mount on my machine should be here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41285/

[08:10] <Neil3> hi all, tried to install the 64bit version of gutsy, the installer hangs when trying to partition my hd (trying to erase it), the machine is a dell inspiron 6400 laptop. Could I be doing something wrong?
[08:10] <CookieMonster> will ubuntu work in vmware?
[08:10] <Jordan_U> CookieMonster, Yes
[08:10] <scguy318> racarter: sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/windows force?
[08:10] <jotil> ckw__, MSI TV@anywhere Plus
[08:10] <scguy318> racarter: well
[08:10] <racarter> do i type the question mark?
[08:10] <scguy318> racarter: sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/windows -o force?
[08:10] <scguy318> no
[08:11] <ckw__> jotil:I dont know whether that card is supported under MythTV...which is what you want to try and use
[08:11] <Jordan_U> scguy318, You forgot the mount :)
[08:11] <IlanG> IcemanV9: I'm installing it now. (the fglrxinfo). let's see what it'll say
[08:11] <alromaithi> guys with gutsy ubuntu  , i downloaded kde desktop and im using it , but i cant use the kde 4,0 themes with compiz , because emerald comes instead , when removing emerald i dont see a title bar
[08:11] <ckw__> Jotil:what chipset is the card based on, do you know
[08:11] <darkzero> hey all
[08:11] <Cyber_Stalker> !feisty
[08:11] <racarter> yes! the force command worked...
[08:11] <ubotu> Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) is the 6th release of Ubuntu.  Upgrade to Fesity: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FeistyUpgrades - Downloading: http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/
[08:11] <riotkittie> im downloading the torrent and about to do a clean install, myself. seven mins left, wooohoo. then again, its late and i'm feeling lazy.
[08:12] <riotkittie> i'm going to be so mad if gutsy continues to refuse to install to my external. grr.
[08:12] <jotil> ckw__: i used it with feisty but never used mythtv. it works with v4l
[08:12] <IcemanV9> IlanG: ah. so fglrx was not installed then. ok. let me know if it works or not (aticonfig)
[08:12] <racarter> ok.. question 1.. how do i automount the ntfs drive now?
[08:12] <darkzero> anyone know if totem-xine has a setting for video output so I can set it to view x11
[08:12] <Cyber_Stalker> !latest
[08:12] <racarter> actually that's like question 30 for me by now...
[08:12] <ubotu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[08:12] <alromaithi> guys with gutsy ubuntu  , i downloaded kde desktop and im using it , but i cant use the kde 4,0 themes with compiz , because emerald comes instead , when removing emerald i dont see a title bar
[08:12] <jotil> ckw__: it was supported in Feisty. V4L has support for the chip.
[08:12] <dga> racarter:make an entry in your fstab
[08:12] <Cyber_Stalker> whats latest ubuntu?
[08:12] <Jordan_U> racarter, Install ntfs-config
[08:13] <Jordan_U> Cyber_Stalker, 7.10
[08:13] <alromaithi> Cyber_Stalker: 7.10 gutsy
[08:13] <IlanG> IcemanV9: Yep. 4 lines
[08:13] <racarter> i did run ntfs-config earlier
[08:13] <IcemanV9> IlanG: then aticonfig should be working
[08:13] <IlanG> IcemanV9: what do you want to know from those 4 lines?
[08:13] <ckw__> jotil:try installing mythtv and see if the card is recognized when you run the backend...that will be the true test
[08:13] <racarter> i will paste the contents of fstab in a minute...
[08:13] <alromaithi> Jordan_U: can you help me plz , i did a fresh install of gutsy guys with gutsy ubuntu  , i downloaded kde desktop and im using it , but i cant use the kde 4,0 themes with compiz , because emerald comes instead , when removing emerald i dont see a title bar
[08:13] <Cyber_Stalker> !gutsy

[08:13] <IlanG> IcemanV9: oh... i'll try
[08:13] <darkzero> guess not
[08:14] <alromaithi> Jordan_U: problem is i want to see the icon in the system tray where i used to right click and change themes from theyr lke in feisty
[08:14] <racarter> also ls /media/windows/Documents\ and\ Settings\
[08:14] <racarter> does not show any files in the folder
[08:14] <racarter> which should not be true...
[08:14] <racarter> i hope its not true
[08:14] <Extravert> hello
[08:15] <Jaggs> is there someone in here willing to help me figure out why my wireless is not functioning?
[08:15] <Extravert> does anyone know how to upgrade by iso or cd?
[08:15] <jotil> ckw__, running the test with xawtv. don't you think mythtv should support v4l?
[08:15] <crazytime> anyone have any ideas about the 7.10 alt cd install saying "the CD_ROM does not seem to contain a valid 'Release' file"?
[08:15] <racarter> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41287/
[08:15] <racarter> is the contents of /etc/fstab
[08:15] <K_Dallas> Hi guys! A quick question: If I install ubuntu, would it be hard to add Xfce and when added, would it be much different than Xubuntu? Thanks
[08:15] <racarter> is it wrong?
[08:16] <Flannel> crazytime: You're trying to do the CDrom upgrade?
[08:16] <ckw__> jotil:I believe it does...i have seen many references to v4l in the myth config screens
[08:16] <Flannel> K_Dallas: It'll be the same (install the xubuntu-desktop pacakage)
[08:16] <scguy318> racarter: nope
[08:16] <crazytime> Flannel: no a clean install
[08:16] <Extravert> Flannel:  you know how to do the upgrade by cd or iso?
[08:16] <K_Dallas> Flannel, thank you very much.
[08:16] <Flannel> Extravert: You can upgrade with the alternate CD, yes.
[08:16] <scguy318> racarter: it must have been the fact that the NTFS partition was not cleanly dismounted as the reason why it didn't mount the first time
[08:16] <IcemanV9> Jaggs: can u elaborate more on your wireless? what kind? is it turned on? is it up and running?
[08:16] <Extravert> Flannel: I have th eregular
[08:16] <Flannel> crazytime: Try checking the CD for defects (at the boot menu)
[08:17] <IlanG> IcemanV9: I don't have the file "xorg.conf". does it means i need to install something ?
[08:17] <racarter> the thing is that i am pretty sure i could not access /media/sda1 right after reboot
[08:17] <racarter> or i could access but nothing there
[08:17] <scguy318> racarter: yeah that was probably why
[08:17] <racarter> which is why i was trying to manually mount it
[08:17] <Flannel> Extravert: desktop CD can't be used to upgrade, only install (although you can always reinstall around your home partition)
[08:17] <IntuitiveNipple> crazytime: Possibly... see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/143958
[08:17] <IlanG> IcemanV9: opps. my mistake. I do have it
[08:17] <IcemanV9> IlanG: what? how did you install ubuntu?
[08:17] <freetos> does anybody know how i can install all the required shit to compile everything and anything, ie.. sudo apt-get install ....?
[08:17] <racarter> i am confused
[08:17] <IcemanV9> IlanG: nm. you found it. :)
[08:17] <IlanG> I upgraded it from 7.04
[08:18] <Flannel> freetos: build-essential, and please watch the language
[08:18] <WaltzingAlong> freetos: build-essential
[08:18] <CoasterMaster> !info build-essential | freetos
[08:18] <Jaggs> IcemanV9: I have a HP Pavilion dv6000, with a broadcom wireless card built in... I believe I have everything for that... ut its not picking anything up at all
[08:18] <ubotu> freetos: build-essential: informational list of build-essential packages. In component main, is optional. Version 11.3ubuntu1 (gutsy), package size 6 kB, installed size 48 kB
[08:18] <freetos> Flannel: thanks
[08:18] <crazytime> IntuitiveNipple:  okay thanks i will check the link
[08:18] <racarter> does anyone think there is something wrong with my /dev/sda1 partition?
[08:18] <IntuitiveNipple> freetos: To get you started: sudo apt-get install build-essential gettext autoconf automake
[08:18] <jotil> ckw__, heh. the card is working. i guess MythTV is pretty much the best software out there?
[08:18] <racarter> maybe that's why windows won't boot anymore?
[08:18] <nemik> so any way to make gnome's calendar/time start on mondays and not sundays?
[08:18] <hotshot23t> So i used the upgrade process and it got to the point where it opened restricted driver for the broadcom43xx. It goes on to say that the driver is open source but the firmware is not. So I let it do it's thing and internet is working fine (which is an amazing feat in itself with this card.) So anyway my question is, what driver am i using? Open source driver or the ndsiwrapper driver that I had working from firesty
[08:18] <IcemanV9> Jaggs: ah. broadcom. you'll need nisdiswrapper (sp?).
[08:19] <scguy318> hotshot23t: open source driver using closed-source firmware
[08:19] <tritium> nemik: I believe that's affected by locales settings
[08:19] <scguy318> hotshot23t: bcm43xx I think?
[08:19] <nemik> tritium: so how to change?
[08:19] <Flannel> nemik: If its not a locale setting, you might try perusing gconf
[08:19] <scguy318> IcemanV9: ndiswraper
[08:19] <scguy318> *ndiswrapper
[08:19] <ckw__> jotil:AFAIK that is true...it works here flawlessly with a Hauppauge PVR-350
[08:19] <Jaggs> ndiswrapper... got it, it now shows wireless as an option but... no connections available at all
[08:20] <anya123> hi
[08:20] <racarter> hmm.. i guess i should restart to see if i can read anything from /media/sda1 right?
[08:20] <IlanG> IcemanV9: I run "sudo  aticonfig --initial --input=/etc/X11/xorg.con" and at the and it says: "Aborted (core dumped)
[08:20] <tritium> nemik: perhaps sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales, but I'm not positive
[08:20] <hotshot23t> scguy318: now i've heard that it only runs at 11 mbps vs the 54 using the ndiswrapper method
[08:20] <anya123> this irssi is really archaic looking
[08:20] <tritium> nemik: also, check your System -> Administration -> Language Support
[08:20] <nemik> anya123: it is the best
[08:20] <scguy318> hotshot23t: not at all
[08:20] <rohan_> how do i check which version of ubuntu am i running ? because unlike other distros ubuntu has no file in etc, like ubuntu_version or so
[08:20] <Flannel> anya123: Not really, its just not frilly
[08:20] <Flannel> rohan_: lsb_release -a
[08:20] <anya123> why, nemil?
[08:20] <nemik> tritium: thanks i'll see
[08:20] <anya123> it's impossible to use
[08:20] <racarter> rohan_ uname ?
[08:20] <arooni_> folks, i can't upgrade to 7.10, everytime i do upgrade from feisty it says it cant get a package or two and the upgrade aborts...ideas?
[08:21] <hotshot23t> does it have to do with wine
[08:21] <tritium> racarter: lsb_release -a would be best
[08:21] <scguy318> arooni_: try downloading the alternative CD and upgrading use that
[08:21] <nemik> anya123: it is great, srsly.
[08:21] <anya123> how can i get it to show who'shere
[08:21] <nemik> anya123: /names
[08:21] <anya123> this is like .... cmd prompt business
[08:21] <racarter> where do they get the code names from?
[08:21] <nrp> No #ubuntu+1 yet?  There appear to be new packages in Hardy
[08:21] <scguy318> anya123: that's the nature of a command-line IRC client :P
[08:22] <Flannel> racarter: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames
[08:22] <tritium> anya123: there's a plugin you can load to show a list of nicks
[08:22] <zNOOPy> i have big problems to get my ubuntu to start on my sony 40" lcd, anyone got a solution for me ?
[08:22] <hotshot23t> arooni_: did it tell you it failed to fetch a
[08:22] <IcemanV9> IlanG: just type sudo aticonfig --initial; sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
[08:22] <tritium> anya123: it's in the irssi-scripts package
[08:22] <anya123> cani make it more usesrfriendly?
[08:22] <scguy318> zNNOOPy: what problem exactly
[08:22] <IcemanV9> IlanG: then restart the X (ctrl alt backspace)
[08:22] <anya123> i like xchat but i don't want to pay the fee - im in school
[08:22] <Flannel> anya123: What isn't friendly about it?
[08:22] <Flannel> anya123: xchat is free
[08:22] <nemik> the command-line is the best user interface ever
[08:22] <anya123> it is?
[08:22] <jlebrech> anyone know how to install an xfi xtreme audio soundcard? it has an audigy chip, but the vendor strings say xfi.
[08:22] <tritium> anya123: sure, and it's available in ubuntu
[08:22] <IlanG> IcemanV9: ok. i'll try
[08:22] <Flannel> anya123: Of course, its in main.
[08:22] <bryce_> hi everyone, i'm having some issues upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10 using the update manager - getting a gzip sub process generated an error code. anyone help with this?
[08:23] <IcemanV9> anya123: everything is free on ubuntu
[08:23] <nemik> ssh+screen+irssi = best chat experience
[08:23] <anya123> if i stop using irsssi, do i need to uninstall it?  or is it dif from windows like that?
[08:23] <bmt2> hello to all
[08:23] <ckw__> IcemanV9:You seem to be hip to the ati fglrx driver...I am trying to extend to the second monitor with an ATI AIW 9600....is this possible with this card and this driver?
[08:23] <bmt2> i have a question in regards to audacity
[08:23] <Flannel> anya123: It'll take up harddrive space, but that's it.
[08:23] <scguy318> anya123: you dont have to, you can remove it if you want
[08:23] <extrakick> i persoally thing it would be better to do fresh install of 7.10
[08:23] <zNOOPy> scguy318, it works great on my samsung 22" monitor... but when i plug in the hdmi for my 40" the screen goes black after grub countdown
[08:23] <Madpilot> Flannel, neither xchat nor xchat-gnome are in Main, actually. Both Universe.
[08:23] <extrakick> that is wat im planning on doing
[08:23] <anya123> remove it from the library?  or remove it from my computer?
[08:23] <bmt2> i just tried to DNB mix that I found in mpeg format to mp3
[08:23] <scguy318> zNOOPy: hmm, not sure
[08:23] <[chr0n0s]> ok, does this makes any sense.. i installed the ati drivers for xorg 7.1, then xserver started, i goto restricted manager and checked  "ATi Acclerated Graphics Driver" my question is which driver i am using finally?
[08:23] <anya123> a bit confused about it all still
[08:23] <extrakick> but then again im new to linux, others might say otherwise
[08:24] <Flannel> Madpilot: xchat-gnome got demoted?  Geez, whats with canonical and the crusade against usable IRC clients?
[08:24] <jlilly> anyone found a fix to the problem where dual displays are effectively one giant screen? (gnome-panels span both screens as do maximized windows) Using nvidia 7600 GS, Gutsy Ask if you need more info.
[08:24] <Madpilot> anya123, just ignore it. irssi doesn't take up a lot of space.
[08:24] <bmt2> Audacity is looking for libmp3lame.so.0 which is located in /usr/lib
[08:24] <bmt2> but for some reason Audacity doesn't sit it
[08:24] <Madpilot> Flannel, sod if I know.
[08:24] <lwizardl> hi
[08:24] <IcemanV9> ckw__: never try dual monitor with ati driver before ... someone here will give you answers
[08:24] <Flannel> Madpilot: http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/gnome/xchat-gnome  its in main
[08:24] <bmt2> could the file be "hidden" if so, how do I change tha t?
[08:24] <bmt2> tha t?
[08:24] <racarter> yeah the code names still dont make sense after reading that
[08:24] <Madpilot> Flannel, ah, so it is. thought it had been demoted too.
[08:24] <anya123> oops
[08:24] <jlilly> Flannel: have you tried dual monitors with nvidia?
[08:24] <racarter> what happened to gaim?
[08:24] <ckw__> IcemanV9:10-4...thanks
[08:24] <anya123> how do i get out of irssi and back to cmd promt?
[08:24] <Flannel> Madpilot: Wouldn't put it past them
[08:24] <Flannel> anya123: /quit
[08:24] <anya123> i want xchat
[08:24] <nemik> anya123: /quit
[08:24] <dga> racarter: gaim is now pidgin
[08:25] <bmt2> anya123: /exit
[08:25] <Flannel> jlilly: No
[08:25] <racarter> why the rename? gaim sounded more reasonable
[08:25] <bryce_> anyone here that can help out with a Gutsy Gibbon upgrade problem?
[08:25] <MikeVail> ok i'll say it, i've become too lazy to add taxonomy tags. is there anyway to auto generate them?
[08:25] <Flannel> racarter: issues with AOL
[08:25] <Jordan_U> Flannel, Madpilot It's xchat that is in universe
[08:25] <lwizardl> i have 3 directories in my trash that I can't delete how can i force remove them
[08:25] <IcemanV9> ckw__: it is doable though; i have seen others mention that it worked
[08:25] <racarter> bastards
[08:25] <Madpilot> racarter, AOL was probably muttering
[08:25] <jlilly> bryce_: just ask your question and get ignored like the rest of us ;)
[08:25] <jube> gutsy installed. pidgin takes a LONG time to connect to irc............  on feisty, it was almost instant
[08:25] <jotil> ckw__, last question: mythubuntu is what you installed? for the backend and frontend of mythtv?
[08:25] <bryce_> jlilly, seems that way :(
[08:26] <racarter> i am going to restart soon even though i know it wont do anything..
[08:26] <racarter> is there anyway to check an ntfs partition for problems?
[08:26] <IlanG> IcemanV9: after running aticonfig --initial, it says : warning: could not find configuration file/ please copy configoration file tamplate to /etc/X11
[08:26] <extrakick> gnight all, im off doe now, adios
[08:26] <jlilly> bryce_: yea. I've been trying to get my displays fixed all day. Its killing me not having this :( :(

It's like no keyboard is connected: No key works. any idea? (keyboard worked when I installed 6.06 lts at it's time)
[08:35] <zyxnull> Ati on 7.10 double sucks

[08:40] <racarter> sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-alsa  ==> already installed
[08:40] <misha> hi, can someone help me to enable desktop effects with an ati 9550?
[08:40] <gouki> For any Tribal Wars players out there... I just created UBU (Ubuntu Users) tribe. Feel free to join! :)
[08:40] <IlanG> IcemanV9: no....
[08:41] <jube> is there a compiz command to unoverlap all windows? I thought it was Super-E but that only shows all the desktops...
[08:41] <racarter> should i go with gstreamer-tools package?
[08:41] <Kee1> how can I reconfigure alsa? my configuration's all messed up
[08:41] <IlanG> IcemanV9: do you mean in /etc/x11?
[08:41] <teddy> wheres about?
[08:41] <racarter> can you use a wildcard for apt-get install?
[08:41] <bodinux> Hello, I upgrade to a new 7.10, and I can't importe the evolution mails and contacts from the 7.04 to 7.10
[08:41] <Jordan_U> racarter, Yes
[08:41] <scguy318> puli: Feisty or Gutsy? and that link is VERY old
[08:42] <IcemanV9> IlanG: no i am talking about one line that contains fglrx .... you can type this command: grep fglrx xorg.conf
[08:42] <Gunner_Sr> how can I see the fans in ACPI, when I go to /proc/acpi/fan there isn't anything there?
[08:42] <racarter> ok.. so i will do sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins*
[08:42] <shadylookin> is their a guide to get the java plugins to work with gutsy 64 bit?
[08:42] <scguy318> puli: why not just do sudo apt-get install ttf-malayalam-fonts
[08:43] <puli> scguy that font is not readable
[08:43] <puli> thats supports though
[08:43] <bodinux> Hello, I upgrade to a new 7.10, and I can't importe the evolution mails and contacts from the 7.04 to 7.10
[08:43] <Lifeisfunny> for Visual Effects, I really like the rotating cube, is there a way to have that instead of the 'slide'
[08:43] <Gunner_Sr> would creating my own DSDT fix this problem?
[08:43] <jotil> racarter, "Applications > Add/Remove" then on the right panel - select "Sound & Video" then scroll down to G
[08:43] <jotil> racarter, you will find the GStreamer plugins over ther
[08:43] <jotil> there*
[08:44] <IlanG> IcemanV9: sorry. i don't understand you. while running grep fglrx xprg.conf I did not see anything happend
[08:44] <dga> Lifeisfunny: system > preferences > appearance > visual effects > custom
[08:44] <scguy318> puli: dunno maybe install the ttf-indic-fonts package?
[08:44] <racarter> i never use the add/remove applet for some reason.. i forgot to include all applications for that
[08:45] <racarter> instead of filtering for "supported applications" only which is there by default i guess
[08:45] <shadylookin> so does anyone know how to get java firefox plugins to work in 64bit gutsy?
[08:45] <rubikcube> hi, is the "Find best Server" button in adept (repository settings menu) of any use yet?  So far it just freezes the program but that could be due to the current heavy load on all the mirrors as well, maybe.

[09:02] <Eagle_101> Hi... Is their an ftp mirror up that has xubuntu on it? (I've noticed that ubuntu, kubuntu, and edubuntu have ftp mirrors, but can't find an ftp one for xubuntu). I ask because ftp goes something like 20-40x faster in terms of downloading.

[09:02] <Nullkuhl> then ??
[09:03] <dga> zyxnull: sure it does
[09:03] <racarter> is there anyway to use chkdsk with ntfs-3d tools ?

[09:04] <jotil> riotkittie, don't scare us. i was thinking of upgrading my laptop to gutsy. the phrase "fresh install" scares the hell out of me.
[09:04] <chowmeined> its probably a broadcom
[09:04] <adante> can someone recommend a good file browser?
[09:04] <riotkittie> chowmeined: it's an ralink. i can probably get it to behave, i just cant be bothered at this hour. [and if i cant, i'll go the ndiswrapper route again]
[09:04] <zyxnull> dga: In Ubuntu Feisty the Composite extension is enabled by default, however, fglrx does not yet support Composite with DRI. In order to disable Composite you have to edit the xorg.conf file:
[09:04] <adante> as alternative to nautilus
[09:04] <Nonsik> hey can anyone help me install a boot loader on a software raid?
[09:05] <zyxnull> http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_Guide
[09:05] <hislop> how do i get extra 3d effect plugin in my compiz-fusion?
[09:05] <Nullkuhl> [Jordan_U] so after that if i want composite i have to install xgl ?
[09:05] <riotkittie> jotil: hee hee hee
[09:05] <chowmeined> riotkittie: did you check the restricted drivers manager?
[09:05] <dga> zyxnull: it works in gutsy?
[09:05] <riotkittie> why would i need to check restricted driver manager for ralink?
[09:05] <chowmeined> riotkittie: drivers?
[09:05] <IntuitiveNipple> racarter: no, but you can use ntfsfix in ntfsprogs package
[09:05] <Jordan_U> Nullkuhl, Yes, "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"
[09:06] <zyxnull> dga: It's not gutsy's fault, it's ATI's latest drivers fault
[09:06] <Dyus> adante: a web browser or a file browser
[09:06] <Nullkuhl> why does ati </3 linux lol
[09:06] <chowmeined> they are lazy
[09:06] <zyxnull> dga: Plus, I've just installed the latest ATI drivers and got full compiz effects, including cube and 3D support
[09:07] <dga> zyxnull: me too
[09:07] <donogameel> can somebody tell me how to upgrade to Alsa 1.0.15 in Gutsy? I've just come over from Slackware, and Ubuntu is confusing me because nothing compiles easily
[09:07] <chowmeined> donogameel: need to install dev libraries
[09:07] <loompek> zyxnull what gpu do you have?
[09:07] <Eagle_101> donogameel: you are umm... realy not supposed to compile, but yesif you insist... get the libraries
[09:07] <zyxnull> loompek: Ati Radeon 9700 Pro
[09:07] <cintapucino> a
[09:07] <Eagle_101> ubuntu uses binaries
[09:07] <loompek> and you use ati drivers
[09:07] <donogameel> do i use apt-get?
[09:08] <cintapucino> hii...........
[09:08] <Eagle_101> yes
[09:08] <Eagle_101> or synaptics
[09:08] <Jordan_U> Any way to diagnose and hopefully fix "can't calculate upgrade" When trying to upgrade to Gutsy ?
[09:08] <dga> i would suggest a fresh install.
[09:08] <donogameel> the alsa-project website doesn't have a guide for Ubuntu so i'm a bit clueless
[09:08] <adante> Dyus: file browser
[09:08] <zyxnull> Jordan_U: It's better to upgrade from the alternate disc, safer, faster, better
[09:08] <riotkittie> not sure why i'd need the restricted driver manager for drivers that are GPL'ed and actually included with ubuntu
[09:09] <loompek> so i just need to install compizconfig-setting-manager or something like that...
[09:09] <Eagle_101> try apt-get install alsa (or searchign for it in synaptics)
[09:09] <Dyus> adante: i prefer to use thunar
[09:09] <chowmeined> riotkittie: oh they are? ok.. i dont have ralinks..
[09:09] <loompek> and i'll be able to enable cube and stuff
[09:09] <chowmeined> riotkittie: so its the network manager that isnt working?
[09:09] <zyxnull> riotkittie: ATI and NVIDA drivers are not GPL
[09:09] <donogameel> okay - is it the same for the NVIDIA drivers?
[09:09] <donogameel> just use Synaptic?
[09:09] <chowmeined> zyxnull: he is referring to ralink wireless chipsets
[09:09] <riotkittie> zyxnull: and neither ati nor nvidea have anything to do with my wireless ;)
[09:09] <Eagle_101> well if its a restricted driver, it will probably show up in the restricted drivers menu
[09:10] <loompek> zyxnull i belive ati drivers will sooner or later be opensource, prolly not under gpl, but still...
[09:10]  * Jordan_U is trying do-release-upgrade
[09:10] <Eagle_101> and yes, alsa is in synaptics or in apt-get
[09:10] <adante> Dyus: thanks! thats exactly what i was looking for (used it before, forgot name)
[09:10] <chowmeined> loompek: they already released them
[09:10] <chowmeined> loompek: but not GPL...
[09:10] <bluefox83> ok, in gutsy...whats the little key combination to pop up the little "run" dialog?
[09:10] <chowmeined> loompek: MIT license (it fits with xorg)
=== riotkittie is now known as iamnotadude
[09:10] <Dyus> adante: no problem :)
[09:10] <iamnotadude> bluefox83: ALT + F2
[09:10] <chowmeined> loompek: along with all the specs
[09:11] <rothchild> how do I make compiz use metacity as its window decorator rather than emerald
[09:11] <Eagle_101> Does anyone know where an xubuntu mirror might be?
[09:11] <iamnotadude> rothchild: metacity --replace

[09:11] <rothchild> iamnotadude how do I set it so it does it every time I boot?
[09:12] <harmental> hey guys...
[09:12] <harmental> I've sucessfully upgragrinng through the alpha cycle of gutsy.  I upgraded to kubuntu 7.10 offical a few days ago. When I now try to "get updates" in adept, I see the "versionupgrade" button. When I enter it, it fails after I press ok for the packages not anymore supported. It says no need to upgrade and it cancels and change back.
[09:12] <harmental> any ideas?
[09:12] <wasabi_> i am trying to compile gecko-media-player in gusty, but it tells me i'm missing the xpidl compiler. i did an apt search and no packaged found
[09:12] <wasabi_> can anyone help?
[09:12] <Nonsik> can anyone help me install a boot loader on a software raid?
[09:12] <adante> anybody using au.archive.ubuntu... is it down
[09:12] <adante> ?
[09:13] <jacquesmerde> all software sources are disabled by default, yeah? but you have to change that if you want restricted drivers or codecs, yeah?
[09:13] <wasabi_> adante, doesn't seem down to me
[09:13] <Jordan_U> jacquesmerde, No they are all enabled by default
[09:13] <Dyus> adante: up for me as well
[09:13] <jacquesmerde> Jordan_U: All? you being sarcastic?
[09:14] <adante> hm i can't access it via apt or browsing it through firefox
[09:14] <wasabi_> jacquesmerde, no. try pinging it
[09:14] <Jordan_U> jacquesmerde, All of the official Ubuntu repos, i.e. main universe multiverse and restricted
[09:14] <zyxnull> jacquesmerde: If you installed without internet connection, gutsi comments all the Internet sources
[09:15] <rothchild> how do I make compiz use metacity as its window decorator rather than emerald (without switching off compiz)
[09:15] <wasabi_> anyone know what package contains the xpidl compiler?
[09:15] <jacquesmerde> zyxnull: that was my next question, yeah.whether coz i lacked a net connectino when i installed....why???
[09:16] <zyxnull> jacquesmerde: I don't know, that happened to me too, however, it's easily fixed on "Software sources"
[09:16] <jacquesmerde> so n00bs like me, if we install without a net connection, how do we know the "right" sources to select?or even know we're supposed to?
[09:16] <[chr0n0s]> i have set my default desktop manager to be xdm, now how i set my default session to be xfce ? its gnome as of now
[09:17] <zyxnull> jacquesmerde: If you manually check the file /etc/apt/sources.list you'll get explanations on what is recommended, why and what not
[09:17] <wasabi_> rothchild, are you using the latest compiz?
[09:18] <MrEgg964> Hi all, me again. I upgraded to Gutsy, and ran into a few issues. I did a aptitude safe-ugrade, things have been fixed. I'm not sure my new Gutsy version is the full one though, as for instance I now have a Gnome logo instead of the Ubuntu logo next to the Applications menu. I like the Gnome logo, mind you - but is this a hint somehow that my Gutsy upgrade isn't total?
[09:18] <wasabi_> rothchild, compiz fusion has this option. gusty has it built in
[09:18] <gkwong> Can anybody help me out with my ATI videocard and ubuntu 7.10? Please msg me if you can, thanks.
[09:18] <jacquesmerde> zyxnull: yeah, i know. i just have a wierd thing for "defaults"
[09:19] <Jordan_U> gkwong, Have you tried Restricted Manager?
[09:19] <zyxnull> jacquesmerde: In fact, i agree with you, i felt not having enabled the sources as a fault
[09:19] <wasabi_> MrEgg964, the dev recommends that you do a clean install because of this

[09:22] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. Installation instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
[09:22] <kc> is this thing going to stay tuff as hell to work on the network interface side of the machine???
[09:22] <jacquesmerde> zyxnull: i'm sure its a bug. i mean, lots of people install without a net connection, and if they do the lose the easy restricted drivers codecs enabling. coz they have to magically know about sources
[09:22] <gkwong> jordan: i installed a security update, is that a package?
[09:22] <wasabi_> rothchild, that runs compiz with metacity as default decorator
[09:22] <Jordan_U> gkwong, Yes
[09:22] <MrEgg964> wasabi_: I'm looking for a way to force a check on my upgrade manually, and clean the system at the end of the process. Any idea?
[09:23] <kane77> has the pidgin plugin bug been fixed?
[09:23] <gkwong> Jordan: then yeah, in that case, i can install packages
[09:23] <SoulChild> hey all. which package do i need to have the encrption in my settings menue ???
[09:23] <dga> zyxnull: have they addressed the suspend to ram bug yet?
[09:23] <ckw__> zyxnull:I thought thats what you guys were talkin about...i will try them...i am trying to get my desktop to extend to the second display on an ATI AIW 9600...perhaps i will have better luck with the newer drivers...on my way to the site now...thanks!

[09:24] <gkwong> Jordan: can I just download the driver from the ATI website?
[09:24] <ndan> hey neone know of linux applications like Flash MX -- so i can edit my flash files
[09:25] <zyxnull> dga: I don't know the details, but i got full compiz effects with no problems... at least not in this last 40 minutes that the setup has been working
[09:25] <Jordan_U> gkwong, Yes, you will need to reinstall them whenever there is a kernel upgrade
[09:25] <dga> zyxnull: does your system lock up when you suspend or hibernate?
[09:25] <Kee1> ndan: have you tried flash mx with wine?
[09:25] <ckw__> zyxnull:BTW...I don't need to run Compiz to simply extend to the other monitor, do I?
[09:25] <zyxnull> dga: Nope. let me try it again

[09:26] <racarter> question about ntfsfix
[09:26] <gkwong> jordan: ok, i'll just do that then, thanks. one more thing, it takes my ubuntu about 3-5 minutes to boot, XP only takes 1, is that normal?
[09:26] <zyxnull> dga: There is a comment about dead suspend here http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_Guide
[09:26] <racarter> um... how do i use it?
[09:26] <ckw__> Jordan_U:thank you

[09:26] <DanMulvey> can i download progs onto a usb drive and then install them in ubuntu? (cant seem to get my wifi working on the laptop, but i want to get some things installed still)
[09:26] <xipietotec> I upgraded to gutsy, on a dell Inspiron E1505N (that came preinstalled with linux), and I seem to have lost my wireless.
[09:26] <racarter> should it the ntfs partition be mounted?
[09:26] <MrEgg964> wasabi_: I just did that, and it went through; if that's all there is to it, then I guess I'm done and ready to go. I just find it kind of strange I don't have my Ubuntu logo, I don't have my Fast User Change and Desktop Search by default...
[09:26] <xipietotec> it also seems to have changed drivers in restricted driver manager?
[09:27] <dary1> anyone know how to get suspend/resume working for wireless cards?
[09:27] <ndan> dan yea... i just did that with a few apps....
[09:27] <Jordan_U> gkwong, Not that long of a discrepancy usually but yes, Linux isn't optimized for fast boots as much as windows ( though you don't need to boot nearly as much :)
[09:27] <DanMulvey> ndan: thanks, wanted to make sure before i get started!
[09:27] <gkwong> Jordan, haha, ok. Thanks!
[09:27] <Dyus> DanMulvey: i think if u check off only download packages in synaptic u can move em where u like once their downloaded
[09:27] <wasabi_> MrEgg964, you have to add the those to the task bar

[09:28] <ndan> mine was still formated as fat32 too, and that didn't hurt nething (tho i wasn't executing them FROM the travel drive, i copied to hd first)
[09:28] <wasabi_> MrEgg964, if you're missing the ubuntu logo, then you can just reinstall it
[09:28] <Jordan_U> DanMulvey, You can use synaptic to make a package download script
[09:28] <wasabi_> MrEgg964, are you referring to the splash? cause that has been disabled
[09:29] <racarter> how do i find out what processes are using a file?
[09:29] <DanMulvey> jordan_u: actually, i need to download them in windows and then transfer them to my ubuntu machine because it has no net connection
[09:29] <Jordan_U> racarter, lsof | grep /path/to/file
[09:29] <MrEgg964> wasabi_: yeah, sure, I can fix those small issues manually; what I'm wondering though is, is this a hint my Gutsy isn't completely installed?
[09:30] <harmental> I've sucessfully upgraded through the whole alpha cycle of gutsy.  I finally upgraded to gutsy offical a few days ago. When I now try to "get updates" in adept, I see the "versionupgrade" button. When I enter it, it fails after I press ok for the packages not anymore supported. It says no need to upgrade and it cancels and change back.
[09:30] <PriitM> Has anyone else problems with CPU usage in 7.10? Mine is between 50-75% and i only got sys monitor,gnome, gmail notify and pidgin running
[09:30] <wasabi_> MrEgg964, no. most likely it was using your old settings. since you're doing an upgrade.
[09:30] <zyxnull> dga: You're right, there seems to be a problem with suspend
[09:30] <crshman> PriitM, i have issues with CPU usage
[09:31] <crshman> i have no idea why, i think it has to do with my kernel though
[09:31] <dga> zyxnull: unfortunately :(
[09:31] <Jordan_U> DanMulvey, The download script is just "wget <link to .deb>" a bunch of times, it could just as easily be used as a batch file if you install wget on windows, or you could use sed to just grab the URLs out of it
[09:31] <DanMulvey> ohh awesome, thanks a ton...just learning all this stuff
[09:31] <zyxnull> dga: Well, at least this driver is a LOT better than its successors
[09:31] <dmandell> I need a little bit of help with the Compiz Application switcher, the Bring to Front pref isn't working.  Can anyone help?
[09:32] <MrEgg964> wasabi_: That would make sense, too. Now, what about my third party repos? They were all set to point to feisty. They've been disabled prior to the upgrade. Am I just supposed to manually replace feisty by gutsy and re-enable them, or is there a little more than that to it?
[09:32] <allobjects> I get "Authenticating the upgrade failed...:" when starting the Gutsy upgrade, can someone please help
[09:32] <dga> zyxnull: which version of the driver are you using?

[09:56] <xtor_> If I have a core2duo and am running the 686 kernel then should I upgrade to the amd64 kernel image or the emt64 kernel image?
[09:56] <Jordan_U> Any way to diagnose and hopefully fix "can't calculate upgrade" When trying to upgrade to Gutsy ?
[09:56] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, so what is wrong with the ubuntu emacs builds, why not just use those?

[09:59] <mechdave> gharz: You said your routers are MAC filtered?
[09:59] <gharz> yes

[09:59] <spy_fly> Hi i've been trying to setup tomcat by doing this:apt-get instal tomcat5.5 , tomcat also seems to be running but nothing happens when I try lynx on localhost:8180... what could be wrong?
[09:59] <mechdave> gharz: is your MAC for your wireless card on the ok list?
[09:59] <gharz> yes...
[10:00] <pawan1234> how to reconfigure x window
[10:00] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, yah, and you got to turn on the "multiverse"
[10:00] <Elko> codeshah: command-key [, then scroll up
[10:00] <gharz> mechdave: remember, if i enable dhcp on our router i can connect to the network.
[10:00] <gharz> but if i disable DHCP i can't connect.
[10:00] <pawan1234_> hi
[10:00] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, so long ago I forgot how

[10:01] <mechdave> gharz: That just tells the machine where your DNS nameservers are at
[10:01] <DanMulvey> oh my problem is that i dont have my wifi working with my ubuntu laptop right now
[10:01] <codecaine> when you do /etc/init.d/networking restart
[10:01] <codecaine> it uses the resolve.conf
[10:02] <fyodr> any grub experts here? error 17
[10:02] <jacquesmerde> if i boot into "recovery mode" it boots me into a root prompt... if i then press exit it seems to load up gdm etc as usual...does this mean i'm no longer in recovery mode after typing exit?
[10:02] <mechdave> eg: nameserver 192.168.XXX.XXX
[10:02] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, but still gotta be easier to figure out how to get the ubuntu emacs packages to download rather than spend time rebuilding emacs from source

[10:02] <msikma> Hey guys
[10:02] <pawan1234_> how to reconfigure x window
[10:02] <mawell081> hello! i just installed ubuntu 7.10 and i have the following problem: when i want to switch to non-graphical terminals(e.g. STRG + ALT + F1) the screen crashes and nothing happens. it seems to have something to do with my nvidia-driver(nvidia-glx-new). can ya help me?
[10:02] <murlidhar> !hi | msikma
[10:02] <ubotu> msikma: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[10:02] <mechdave> gharz: Be very careful!
[10:02] <msikma> I'm running 7.10 on a MacBook and for some reason I can't seem to switch to any of the text-mode ttys.
[10:02] <msikma> Hi ubotu :)
[10:02] <pacifact> How do i cd into  a win ntfs partition sdb1 in order to do wine command
[10:02] <msikma> Thanks for the welcome

[10:03] <babajaid> how do you kill a non responding program in 7.04
[10:03] <msikma> eck
[10:03] <pacifact> kill -9 pid
[10:03] <gharz> mechdave: anyway, let me just switch to ubuntu and i'll try to figure how to connect to the network using static ip.
[10:03] <gharz> mechdave: regards.
[10:03] <pacifact> How do i cd into  a win ntfs partition sdb1 in order to do wine command
[10:03] <anolis_> does anyone know why the amount of data i have collected isn't proportional to the amount of packets i have sent to the AP? i have a Dell 1350 Wireless card running in ubuntu linux 7.10 (kernel 2.6.22-14-386) with patched bcm43xx drivers. the card seems to be able to inject briefly but then stops just as quickly as it started, the injection test on aireplay-ng only works (barely) if i do ifconfig eth1 down; ifconfig eth1 up; iwconfig
[10:03] <mawell081> hi msikma - i have the same problem!
[10:03] <codecaine> pacifact if its already auto mount /media/sda1
[10:03] <anolis_>  eth1 mode Monitor.. is this just a case of reverse engineered drivers not working perfectly?
[10:03] <DanMulvey> k6rfm: any advice on where to start getting my wireless working? i can see the local networks, but when I try to connect to mine with my pswd it wont connect
[10:03] <mechdave> gharz: No worries, that would be good
[10:03] <lwizardl> ok i just tryied to apt-get hfsplus libc6 libhfsp0 and it says I already have the latest version. what else could be the problem from letting me mount this drive?
[10:04] <msikma> mawell081: I've not used Ubuntu on a MacBook before. I'm in a text-mode tty right now, and I can switch to the others just fine...just not when I'm in graphical mode.
[10:04] <mechdave> gharz: Just plug in the ethernet cable for now
[10:04] <sku> my laptop lost all power, and now the network cards (wired and wireless) don't work.  if i run ifconfig i get: "syntax error near unexpected token
[10:04] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, can you admin/configure the wifi router?
[10:04] <sku> " and then a load of garbage
[10:04] <DanMulvey> yeah
[10:04] <anolis_> what does dmesg say sku?
[10:05] <bzaks> does anyone in here know korean?
[10:05] <anolis_> can you post the output of the dmesg command to pastebin please sku
[10:05] <Shaffox> I'm having some troubles with my wireless since I've updated to Gibbon.
[10:05] <msikma> mawell081: apparently, to me, "fn" + command + 1 switches to tty1. But *only* if you're already in a tty.
[10:05] <smy1220> !ask | smy1220 i have now reinstalled 3 times and no matter what when i go to gconf-editor apps->nautilis->desktop and enable the computer,network,trash icons they never show up. any help with this?
[10:05] <bzaks> just curious, I'm having problems trouble shooting a driver installation
[10:05] <bzaks> and I'd just like a translation
[10:05] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, first thing to try is temporarily (!) turn off all security on the router, run full open.  See if you can connect from the ubuntu laptop then.
[10:06] <mawell081> msikma: i guess in my case it has something to do with the nvidia driver
[10:06] <ckw__> anyone familiar with the newest drivers from the ATI site?
[10:06] <DanMulvey> k6: ok ill try that now
[10:07] <ckw__> i have installed and initialized after removing the current fglrx but i am still unable to extend my desktop to the 2nd display....the choices are there but it wont hold
[10:07] <sku> i can't easily paste anything as i'm using a different comp.  but the last relevant thing in dmesg is "eth1: no ipv6 routers present".  there is some message during bootup, but it flashes past too quickly.  are these messages stored in a logfile somewhere?
[10:07] <mdalek> hi everyone, does anyone use PAN the newsreader
[10:08] <adminn> 7.10 is oficialy a gay version lol
[10:08] <fyodr> i've used pan. now using hellanzb.

[10:08] <k6rfm> adminn, so everybody running it is gay?
[10:08] <tritium> k6rfm: don't repeat that

[10:09] <mdalek> i've noticed since I've upgraded to gutsy, pan has image rendering bugs :(
[10:09] <TequilaWORM> Hi, How can know what is the kernel size after decompression?
[10:09] <TequilaWORM> Any idea?
[10:09] <xipietotec> anyone know how to cycle on an intel pro wireless card from cli?
[10:09] <anolis_> xipietotec what do you mean by 'cycle'?
[10:09] <mechdave> xipietotec: what do you mean cycle?
[10:10] <xipietotec> anolis_, well, in feisty, hitting fn+f2 turned it on, now after upgrading to gutsy, that is an unknown key combination according to dmesg
[10:10] <anolis_> xipietotec what does fn+f2 do
[10:11] <xipietotec> and this is a card that's supposed to "just work" with linux, and now i'm not able to use it
[10:11] <gorski> i upgraded to gutsy, my Restricted Driver Management won't open! ValueError: unsupported format character 'n' (0x6e) at index 287
[10:11] <mechdave> anolis_: xipietotec: sounds like a keyboard short cut
[10:11] <xipietotec> anolis_, it turned on the radio in the wireless card.
[10:11] <DanMulvey_> k6: i can connect with the wireless set to no pswd
[10:11] <anolis_> hmm, what does iwconfig give you? xipietotec
[10:11] <k6rfm> DanMulvey, sorry gotta hit the sack; but the plan should to be seeing if basic networking (w/o security) works; then try adding crypto layers on; if later stuff doesn't work either you've put the keys in wrong or the router or ubuntu has a bug...
[10:11] <xipietotec> anolis_, iwconfig, and ifconfig give me nothing.

[10:23] <Chaos88> hello :)
[10:23] <mechdave> xipietotec: Can you try a reboot?
[10:23] <codecaine> oxeimon make sure you have that port open and u have sshd service installed
[10:23] <lwizardl> ok anyone here use a hfs+ drive on 7.10 ?
[10:23] <murlidhar> is there is any default locations to compile the applications
[10:23] <murlidhar> ?
[10:23] <Anolys> mechdave, xipietotec, i would try 'sudo rmmod <driver>; sudo modprobe <driver>' and see if the card doesn't lightup
[10:23] <chandler_> i am trying to dual boot vista with gutsy...only my grub is not recognizing vista as being installed
[10:24] <Chaos88> who can help me? Firefox is very very slow with ubuntu 7.10 :(
[10:24] <oxeimon> codecaine: how do I make sure I have the port open and have sshd service installed?
[10:24] <Anolys> Chaos88, how much ram do you have?
[10:24] <codecaine> you using a router?
[10:24] <Chaos88> Anolys 1gb ddr 333 (old) :)
[10:24] <dromer> so .. anyone on my boot problem? ^
[10:24] <oxeimon> codecaine: Right now I'm on an older feisty installation. I've been able to ssh to this computer easy.
[10:25] <ckw__> looking for some ATI /fglrx driver help....anyone?
[10:25] <Chaos88> codecaine me? Yes I use...
[10:25] <dromer> only getting a tty kind of sucks :(
[10:25] <dpn`> can anyone tell me why the updater for gibbon tried to download stuff from the net even when i tell it not to?
[10:25] <Apachez> where can I find out more of hos Ubuntu 7.10 alternate cd is doing its crypto stuff on the harddrive when you choose to install with crypto ?
[10:25] <allobjects[2]> codecaine, hmmm although I took the comments out, did 'apt-get update' and now duplicate warnings this time
[10:25] <oxeimon> codecaine: However, I can't ssh to my gutsy installation.
[10:25] <Anolys> Chaos88, that's not THAT bad, what about processor? and how much processes is it using?
[10:25] <mechdave> xipietotec: <quote><Anolys> i would try 'sudo rmmod <driver>; sudo modprobe <driver>' and see if the card doesn't lightup</quote>
[10:25] <oxeimon> codecaine: I'm on a campus network.
[10:25] <asbani> I didn't got any updates in my "Update manager" for the last 2 or 3 days, is it normal or do I have problems in my repos?
[10:25] <dor0> hey guys, what boot options shall i put for 1680x1050 resolution?
[10:25] <murlidhar> chandler_: a program called openBSD or freeBSD helps u . i am not sure of the application name
[10:25] <albus_Dumbledore> chandler_: what partition is Vista on
[10:25] <mechdave> sku: how did you go?
[10:25] <codecaine> ah ok you will have to use the router ip
[10:26] <Chaos88> Anolys now I'm on windows, when I tried, only firefox was running (sorry for my english) :)
[10:26]  * Psi-Jack smiles.
[10:26] <ArtVandalae> Hi, are the Liberation Fonts provided in the repos?
[10:26] <Anolys> asbani, i got an update tonight, but it is all dependent on what software packages you have installed
[10:26] <chandler_> my partitions are all screwed up after the last time i did ubuntu..but it's on my main hard drive C:/
[10:26] <asbani> Anolys: true. thanks!
[10:26] <jxxt> chandler_, it is possible that your vista no longer exists sad but true sometimes -((
[10:27] <chandler_> that can't be good..is there anyway to recover docs that were on my c:/ or has it been reformatted because of gutsy...
[10:27] <chandler_> ?
[10:27] <allobjects[2]> codecaine, tried the upgrade and again get "Authenticating the upgrade failed..."
[10:27] <albus_Dumbledore> chandler_: as root open the file /boot/grub/menu/lst
[10:27] <Anolys> chandler_, yes, you may have accidently deleted it during the install
[10:27] <oxeimon> codecaine how do I use the router ip
[10:27] <sku> mechdave: all my computers are crashing on me :(  I'm thinking i might just do a fresh install of 7.10, usb appears to be not functioning properly either
[10:27] <albus_Dumbledore> chandler_: as root open the file /boot/grub/menu.lst
[10:27] <Chaos88> Anolys have you read?
[10:27] <regebro> Hiya all. The repositories seem very slow, is that because everybody is trying to upgrade, or do they just hate me? :-)
[10:27] <codecaine> allobjects you might need to get a clean respirtory
[10:27] <chandler_> this can't be good..i will check out the menu..
[10:27] <Anolys> Chaos88, is FireFox running faster on Windows?
[10:27] <allobjects[2]> codecaine, meaning ?
[10:27] <codecaine> regebro everybody is upgrading
[10:27] <Chaos88> Anolys absolutely
[10:28] <Anolys> hmm
[10:28] <regebro> codecaine: Any experience in how long it will take for things to cool down? So I know when to try again?
[10:28] <mechdave> sku: nasty, if your data isn't important it may be easier!
[10:28] <jxxt> chandler_, This advise is too late for you but you should always back up your data before doing this kind of thing also I believe you should defag windows first.
[10:28] <DUPAC> najubav
[10:28] <DUPAC> najubav
[10:28] <Anolys> Chaos88, im not experienced enough in the area you are having difficulty with, restate your question and maybe someone else can help you
[10:28] <chandler_> is there anyway to completely uninstally unbuntu so i can get vista only back on here..
[10:28] <DUPAC> yujhnrf
[10:28] <Chaos88> ok :)
[10:29] <Chaos88> who can help me? Firefox is very very slow with ubuntu 7.10 :(
[10:29] <DUPAC> najubav
[10:29] <Anolys> sku, yes a reinstall may be in order
[10:29] <chandler_> i have another question...vista was still functionaly and was able to be found under feisty but since the upgrade to gutsy it's gone
[10:29] <DanMulvey> awesome my wifi works with ubuntu now!!
[10:29] <albus_Dumbledore> chandler_: if Vista has not been overwritten, then getting rid of ubuntu wont help
[10:29] <jxxt> chandler_, use your win recovery disks
=== KennethP_ is now known as KennethP
[10:29] <DanMulvey> i would have never known about that iwconfig, thanks a lot
[10:29] <codecaine> get the orginal respiratory from ubuntuforumns website or ur live cd and replace it
[10:29] <allobjects[2]> codecaine, do you mean switch which server repositories come from ?
[10:30] <kaminix> Chaos88: Tried Swiftfox? It's like Firefox but modified to increase performance.
[10:30] <jxxt> chandler_, same for me only it was xp that evaporated
[10:30] <Anolys> chandler_, there is a grub installer on the 7.10 cd (from what i hear) that may help you recover your windows boot ability
[10:30] <Chaos88> kaminix no, should I?
[10:30] <chandler_> so download the .iso?
[10:30] <codecaine> disabling ipv6 helps with network speed
[10:31] <Anolys> chandler_, let me ty and find the forum post discussing this issue
[10:31] <kaminix> Chaos88: If you'd like. The setup is really simple, so you're not really loosing anything by trying.
[10:31] <Chaos88> codecaine I already done it
[10:31] <chandler_> okay
[10:31] <Chaos88> ops
[10:31] <Shyde> shouldn't be enough to use "fixmbr" from some windows cd and just delete the partition with ubuntu?
[10:31] <Chaos88> kaminix ... other solutions?
[10:32] <kaminix> Chaos88: http://getswiftfox.com/installer.htm Don't know any other solutions.
[10:32] <jxxt> chandler_, Use a live cd to see if you can find the ntfs partion
[10:32] <codecaine> in firefox you can type about:conf
[10:32] <mechdave> xipietotec: how did you go?
[10:32] <oxeimon> I can ping my desktop, but I can't ssh to it, why?
[10:32] <chandler_> okay..will try that..and see how it goes
[10:33] <regebro> Hmm. Actually it's mostly the french server which is totally overloaded. The main server and US server work fine.

[10:33] <Smegzor> I'm about to upgrade a dual booting pc (XP and Ubuntu).  I have the alternate cd in the drive.  What is the procedure to upgrade using the cd?
[10:33] <Shyde> oxeimon: did you install a ssh server?
[10:33] <dystopianray> oxeimon: it's not running an ssh server perhaps?
[10:33] <pawan> hi
[10:33] <oxeimon> how do I install an ssh server?
[10:33] <chowmeined> aptitude install openssh-server
[10:33] <jxxt> chandler_, if you find the data you can save to a usb card
[10:33] <ckw__> dystopianray:do you know anything about the ATI fglrx driver or am I thinking of someone else?
[10:33] <oxeimon> I just installed gutsy
[10:33] <oxeimon> feisty seems to have come with an ssh server
[10:33] <chowmeined> oxeimon: aptitude install openssh-server
[10:33] <dystopianray> ckw__: you're thinking of someone else
[10:33] <Shyde> nope

[10:35] <sku> mechdave: dmesg is in the pastebin.  (the computer crashing i was having was to do with unplugging a particular memory stick.  it happened on different computers so maybe it's an ubuntu bug)
[10:35] <boris__> how can i install CNR client ? i got gutsy, instructions are for feisty

[10:36] <chandler_> ?
[10:36] <stephanecharette> upgraded to 7.10; I can get to the login screen; I enter my name/password, then hear the logon sound, and then nothing...my mouse just sits there on an empty screen; any ideas?
[10:36] <dwkr> pawan you have a problem with nividia kernel module
[10:36] <sku> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41301/

[10:37] <oxeimon> how can I make it so I can ssh to a dns address instead of an ip address?
[10:37] <sku> mechdave: wow! how do you do it?  many thanks for your help
[10:37] <chandler_> alright..will look into it
[10:37] <Shyde> chandler_: I think you can simply run "fixmbr" from a windows cd console, that should remove grub and boot into windows by default again. There you can simply delete the partition with ubuntu
[10:37] <Smegzor> nevermind.  googled and got it upgrading ^^
[10:37] <Shyde> correct me if I'm wrong please :>

[10:39] <chandler_> i will be back...hopefully..with vista found..at least so i can get some stuff backed up onto usb drive..(mainly pictures and songs)
[10:39] <Shaffox> codecaine, ?
[10:39] <oxeimon> codecaine: ah, so I guess I'd have to pay for that. The thing is though, I'm on my campus network, and I can connect to all the computers in our computer lab by ssh'ing to "torsion.cs.dartmouth.edu" or something

[10:42] <stephanecharette> Anyone know why the desktop would hang after the login screen, after the "drum" sounds are heard, but before the desktop actually comes up?
[10:43] <dox_> is there some trick to upgrading your dist with synaptic that stops it hosing my install?
[10:43] <Jessicatz> hislop: usually deinstall it and install it again
[10:43] <codecaine> can you see your network card interface with iwconfig?
[10:43] <Shaffox> yes
[10:43] <Shaffox> and my essid and acces point are allright.

[10:43] <xipietotec> anolis, nope
[10:43] <Shaffox> When I check network graphical the wireless box is checked. Yet I can't scan the router.
[10:43] <Jessicatz> hislop: go into synaptic, search for compiz and mark the entries as "remove completely"
[10:44] <xipietotec> and its telling me the module does not exist, even though it shows up in restricted manager

[10:45] <Jessicatz> dox_: doesnt update-manager do the job for you?
[10:45] <dox_> I let it
[10:45] <stephanecharette> Please...anyone know why the desktop would hang after the "drum" sounds are heard, but before the desktop actually comes up?
[10:45] <Jessicatz> dox_: if you start update-manager it will display a "update ubuntu" button
[10:45] <albus_Dumbledore> can someone tell me if ubuntu comes with a firewall. If not, where can i get one. If so, do i need to install any other software
[10:46] <anolis> xipietotec, are you sure that is the correct module, it COULD have a _cs after it
[10:46] <dox_> Sorry I thought that was Synaptic in my mind, I meant the update manager

[10:48] <LordLimecat> there would not be a problem with adding Wine's official repos to the sources, would there?  Would it cause conflicts with the official ubuntu-wine package?

[10:49] <Jessicatz> LordLimecat: you can add it without problems
[10:49] <LordLimecat> Jessicatz: even though the versions are different?
[10:49] <LordLimecat> it will just grab the most recent?

[10:50] <codecaine> np
[10:50] <dox> Jessicatz: It's just frustrating because every time I've let Ubuntu do an upgrade to the latest dist (usually only one version higher) it always hoses my system
[10:50] <Jessicatz> LordLimecat: I don't know that, but it surely would not upgrade until there is a newer version in the ubuntu-repos, so it doesnt brake anything
[10:50] <codecaine> shaffox when you type in your wepkey did you do it like 11111122222233333344444455 or 0x01 etc

[11:05] <gharz> mechdave_away: just to give u an idea... i'm currently connected thru wired network.
[11:05] <dromer> any idea why, after the upgrade, root thinks that 2 of my partitions (of which one is /home) are busy and can't be mounted?

[11:05] <dromer> because of it I can't boot into x, I can however get into TTY and start X as root .. but ofcourse I don't want this ..

[11:06] <`ph8> morning all, i've just spent an absolute mare of a few hours messing around with compiz/nvidia-twinview. Does anyone here have a working nvidia twinview setup which lets them maximise a window *to the monitor* rather than across both screens?
[11:06] <Shaffox> codecaine, how?
[11:06] <murlidhar> Tigerman: did u open that with gedit?
[11:07] <codecaine> sudo ifconfig netmask 255.255.255.0
[11:07] <`ph8> if so i'd like a quick chat if that's ok, i can't get my windows to maximise to the monitor they're on only
[11:07] <codecaine> sudo ifconfig interface netmask 255.255.255.0
[11:07] <nesoi> ubuntu is basically at the level now that windows is unnecessary for most things people want to do...
[11:07] <codecaine> u know your router gateway
[11:07] <codecaine> should be like 192.168.1.1
[11:07] <bigbang14> dystopianray: they seem to have exe only, still checking though
[11:07] <nesoi> therefore microsoft will start lawsuits to destroy linux
[11:07] <sku> mechdave_away: ifup: couldn't read interfaces file
[11:07] <dystopianray> bigbang14: you may need to get the files out of the exe installer
[11:08] <sku> mechdave_away: not sure exactly what i should be writing for eth1 - does it depend on the card?
[11:08] <cwillu> codecaine: you can just put /24 after the address to set the subnet rather than spelling out all the 255's
[11:08] <codecaine> cool ty cwillu
[11:08] <dwkr> hi, when i press ctrl alt F1/F6 tty console dont apear, i tried to edit menu.lst but it doesnt work,

[11:10] <bluefox83> cwillu, no
[11:10] <`ph8> i've just upgraded from feisty and wanted compiz going - i've already ditched kde and switched to gnome (which was fun hackery)
[11:10] <bluefox83> it's gone..can't remember how to respawn it
[11:10] <bigbang14>  dystopianray: i will try this later, now i have to go

[11:10] <nesoi> fish: I had the same question as you but no good answers... best answer I got was, do a refresh of update manager and an update and you should be current
[11:11] <bluefox83> cwillu, no dude, i have no panel at all
[11:11] <The_Joe_> I just logged on to see that there was a problem starting the GNOME Settings Daemon - Anyone have any ideas?
[11:11] <dwkr> no idea ?
[11:11] <`ph8> hmm and when you maximise it only goes to the monitor keel?
[11:11] <cwillu> bluefox83: well, that was silly of you, no?  :p
[11:11] <Kee1> `ph8: yup
[11:11] <`ph8> how do you specify your resolutions?

[11:11] <pfeutib>  then it installed them and on the final it complained user not able to write to disk
[11:11] <pfeutib>  asked for passwd but computer was not reacting anymore
[11:11] <pfeutib>  only thing was to switch off
[11:11] <pfeutib>  grub has now new version in it, but its not able to boot

[11:11] <bluefox83> cwillu, i didn't do it, i restarted and it was gone
[11:11] <pfeutib>  now on older version, trying again to upgrade, but it say system up'2'date
[11:12] <pfeutib>  how ca I force to upgrade everything again
[11:12] <pfeutib>  or just fix the kernel?
[11:12] <cwillu> bluefox83: although, try just running gnome-panel in a terminal
[11:12] <fish__> i waited so long for ubuntu's new release, it sucks.
[11:12] <marsjajs> Hi all. I am going to upgrade into 7.10. Schould I switch of or even delete compiz?

[11:13] <cwillu> pfeutib: you can use a livecd to reinstall grub, but your best bet (assuming you don't want to just reinstall) is to make sure /etc/apt/sources.list is using gutsy, and then do apt-get dist-upgrade followed by dpkg-reconfigure -all -phigh, two or three times until the dist-upgrade doesn't do anything anymore (no warranty though)
[11:13] <spnz> what to do ?;/

[11:16] <gharz> nobody has helped me yet. :)
[11:16] <dromer> chowmeined: when I rebooted after the upgrade, I first got an error saying /devhda5 (my /home) and /dev/hda6 (media-partition) where busy and couldn't get mounted .. then I gat a root-prompt and after control-D (quiting) the boot resumed and all I got was TTY

[11:17] <Tigerman> omg, i have edited my /boot/grub/menu.lst but now i can't save it.... what can i do to save it, without closing that file?
[11:18] <chowmeined> dromer: or are you using raid?
[11:18] <nesoi> apparently the video is broken on T23 on gutsy at the moment

[11:20] <lavender_dream> gabbarinho: how much RAM do you have and are you using the LiveCD?
[11:20] <rob> ch40s, use the Restricted Drivers Manager to install the nvidia driver, under the menu
[11:21] <cwillu> janerik: sorry, I need /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[11:21] <thingummywut> i still have a problem with changing display resolution. my gfx card is an old ATI Radeon 7500, and if I change to a higher resolution the screen becomes all black with a weird monitor message
[11:21] <gabbarinho> I have two gigs, lavender; and yes, I am using the LiveCD
[11:21] <ch40s> rob: it fails and says it cant load nvidia-glx-new
[11:21] <gabbarinho> I see the bar move left and right and suddenly the screen will become distorted and that's it :)
[11:21] <nox-Hand> In Sessions -> Startup Programs, can anyone with wireless please tell me what the network manager applet startup code is? It's "nm-applet --SOMETHING" and I forgot what the last bit is (and accidentally deleted it! :()

[11:23] <cwillu> spnz: gutsy?
[11:23] <gharz> mechdave: i can just click the network in the network manager icon and then enter the network password.
[11:23] <mechdave> gharz: what does your /etc/networking /interfaces say?
[11:23] <chowmeined> dromer: could you pastebin /etc/fstab

[11:23] <cwillu> spnz: ooo
[11:23] <lavender_dream> gabbarinho: I also had the same problem when I burned even at 4x and checked the integration of the CD from the installation menu. You should still check MD5 checksum

[11:24] <rob> ch40s, okay
[11:24] <lavender_dream> gabbarinho: To be absolutely sure, you should burn at x1 speed.
[11:24] <chowmeined> dromer: you are on the livecd?
[11:24] <thingummywut> cwillu: and how would i choose this specific monitor? I'm new to Xubuntu

[11:24] <oshiii-_^> ZenAttitude : http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html
[11:24] <chowmeined> dromer: could you pastebin the output of 'mount'
[11:24] <lavender_dream> gabbarinho: If all else fails, you should resort to text based installer, the alternate CD method.
[11:24] <cwillu> janerik: install xserver-xorg-video-intel if it isn't already, and then change Driver "i810" to Driver "intel"
[11:24] <cybbah> remus: for audio?
[11:24] <mechdave> gharz: paste your /etc/networking/interfaces
[11:25] <Tigerman> cwillu, is it possible to restore the 'DMI BIOS year' on my mobo?

[11:25] <nox-Hand> Anyone tell me what the nm-applet line in System -> Preferences -> Session -> Startup Programs is? I lost it. It's a quick find, anyone?
[11:25] <cwillu> thingummywut: xubuntu, I'm not sure;  under ubuntu, you just set the monitor in the control panel

[11:29] <gabbarinho> hmm
[11:29] <cwillu> ksivaji: um, illegal stuff, we don't want to hear about
[11:29] <Terrasque> nesoi: ctrl-alt-backspace kills the X server instantly. If you dont want that, dont use it
[11:30] <gabbarinho> lavender, this seems to be a way to check the iso and not the CD
[11:30] <cwillu> janerik: okay, then just change xorg.conf
[11:30] <cwillu> dromer: I'd just do it from synaptic
[11:30] <chowmeined> nesoi: its an escape method
[11:30] <cwillu> dromer: but just a plain apt-get remove would work
[11:30] <dromer> ok
[11:30] <gharz> mechdave: in my /etc/network/interfaces  there's no eth1... eth1 is my wireless network.
[11:30] <chowmeined> nesoi: if it warns you.. and your mouse doesnt move...
[11:30] <gabbarinho> if the iso is corrupt, then I would assume burning it at 1x speed woudl not make a difference
[11:30] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: correct
[11:30] <cwillu> dromer: purge just removes config settings as well, which won't break anything, but also won't help anything
[11:30] <squeeme> anyone knows how to disable XGL?
[11:30] <Arafangion> nesoi: It is used ONLY in the event of a serious crash
[11:30] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: you verified it against the MD5SUM?
[11:30] <nesoi> Terrasque: killing your session and losing all your data with any keystroke with no warning is not User Friendly
[11:30] <janerik> cwillu: I'm just 4 months user of ubuntu:-) can you tell me how to... Thank you very much so long:-)
[11:30] <gabbarinho> i am not sure what that means, chow
[11:30] <cwillu> janerik: :p
[11:31] <nesoi> ie: not ready for users who don't know what they're doing, which is part of the point of unbuntu, I thought
[11:31] <dromer> cwillu: only evms evms-ncurses are being removed
[11:31] <ksivaji> cwillu will you hangon to 128kb/s
[11:31] <Arafangion> nesoi: How the hell does one *accidentially* simulataniously press three buttons that are physically separated from each other?
[11:31] <gabbarinho> i am struggling a bit to make sense of the instructions
[11:31] <dromer> cwillu: mdadm was already gone :)
[11:31] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: ok
[11:31] <cwillu> janerik: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, look for Driver "i810", change i810 to intel, and restart x
[11:31] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: you ran the check cd for defects?
[11:31] <cwillu> dromer: evms will do it
[11:31] <gabbarinho> yep
[11:31] <gabbarinho> i don't thinkt here is a problem with it
[11:31] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: did it pass?
[11:31] <cwillu> dromer: it grabs the devices so you can't mount them
[11:31] <gabbarinho> yes, it did
[11:31] <janerik> cwillu: thank you so much.
[11:31] <dromer> cwillu: ok, well, hope it works :)
[11:32] <sudoer> does ubuntu 7.10 come with 2.6.23?
[11:32] <cwillu> janerik: thank me when it works :p
[11:32] <mechdave> gharz: just one second, just uploading changes to your file...
[11:32] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: then it isnt corrupt
[11:32] <dromer> cwillu: updateing initramfs ...
[11:32] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: what is happening?
[11:32] <gharz> mechdave: alrighty,..
[11:32] <cwillu> sudoer: don't believe so, although you can run a 2.6.23 kernel if you compile it (modulo issues with restricted kernel modules)
[11:32] <gabbarinho> well, I select installation, and things begin to load
[11:32] <AmsiNZ> Tigerman: Try adding  acpi=force into the boot options for ubuntu in your /boot/grub/menu.lst like grub was suggesting at boot.
[11:32] <gabbarinho> the bar starts moving
[11:32] <cwillu> dromer: you might need to restart as well, not sure if you can rmmod the appropriate things live
[11:32] <gabbarinho> then about 20 seconds later, it hangs
[11:32] <dromer> cwillu: ok, reboot?
[11:32] <gabbarinho> that's it
[11:32] <cwillu> dromer: yep
[11:32] <dromer> cwillu: I will :)
[11:32] <cwillu> well
[11:32] <dromer> brb
[11:32] <cwillu> dromer: you could try it first
[11:33] <nesoi> Arafangion: control-backspace deletes a word... control and alt are next to each other (on my keyboard) ... is it that big a stretch to think that someone will accidentally hit both control and alt when they mean to hit alt, and then touch backspace?
[11:33] <nesoi> I don't think so.
[11:33] <cwillu> but otherwise, reboot
[11:33] <cwillu> nesoi: I've done that :p
[11:33] <mechdave> sku: did that fix your problems?
[11:33] <racarter> can anyone recommend a powerful graphical text editor
[11:33] <chowmeined> nesoi: ctrl+alt+backspace has been around a long time though....
[11:33] <chowmeined> racarter: gvim
[11:33] <nesoi> cwillu: thanks.
[11:33] <cwillu> nesoi: there's an option to disable it in xorg.conf, which I thought they made the default (are you running an upgrade or fresh install)
[11:33] <dystopianray> racarter: kate
[11:33] <dromer> cwillu: try what?
[11:33] <cwillu> chowmeined: legacy doesn't imply goodness
[11:33] <cwillu> dromer: mounting
[11:33] <racarter> besides vi or emacs
[11:33] <nesoi> chowmeined: that's nice, but if ubuntu is supposed to be a general replacement for consumer desktops, having that keystroke in it is Bad
[11:33] <chowmeined> cwillu: but its useful...
[11:33] <mechdave> gharz: try this --> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41315/
[11:34] <dystopianray> racarter: kate is awesome
[11:34] <cwillu> racarter: _especially_ vi and emacs
[11:34] <gabbarinho> wow, all this time I didn't know that control+delete deletes a word
[11:34] <gharz> mechdave: ok.
[11:34] <nesoi> cwillu: upgrade from the beta version of gutsy
[11:34] <cwillu> chowmeined: so is dynamite.
[11:34] <_blitz_> how do i tell whether my bluetooth dongle is detected?
[11:34] <chowmeined> nesoi: well... id rather have it.. when buggy gui apps decide to lock everything up
[11:34] <dromer> cwillu: again I get: mount: /dev/hda5 already mounted or /home/ busy
[11:34] <cwillu> chowmeined: there's a reason the power button doesn't do a hard power off anymore
[11:34] <LuCypher>  /msg ubotu mirrors
[11:34] <cwillu> dromer: k, reboot then
[11:34] <nesoi> chowmeined: if it can be enabled specifically by those who want it, fine. if it's a default, Bad
[11:34] <racarter> ok also i dont really like the command line in gnome.. is there any alternatives
[11:34] <mechdave> _blitz_: try hcitool in a terminal
[11:34] <chowmeined> nesoi: fine
[11:34] <dromer> cwillu: ok, bbl
[11:35] <cwillu> chowmeined: there's another keystroke to disable grabs, and ctrl+alt+f1 should be just as effective without actually killing stuff
[11:35] <Mikkel^> Hello all... i needed Help :)
[11:35] <cybbah> i have an acer 5720 with an intel audio device but my audio don't work with gutsy ... can you help me plssss
[11:35] <Mikkel^> Will LinuX installering Dont working for MS Virtual PC 2007?
[11:35] <gabbarinho> do you have any idea what's going on with my installation, chow?
[11:35] <chowmeined> nesoi: guess we should disable alt+sysctrl then...
[11:35] <_blitz_> ok.lsusb produced a positive result.wil that be enough?
[11:35] <sudoer> if i have fedora 7 installed and i want to upgrade to ubuntu 7.10 can i do it without lose data in simple way?
[11:35] <mechdave> gharz: then restart your network --> /etc/init.d/networking restart
[11:35] <chowmeined> gabbarinho: im sorry, i haven't run into that.. im not sure
[11:35] <racarter> i liked the xubuntu command line
[11:35] <nesoi> chowmeined: what does that do?
[11:35] <gharz> mechdave: ok.
[11:35] <cwillu> racarter: look up 'term' in synaptic, there's at least a dozen
[11:35] <chowmeined> nesoi: does special debug stuff by directly interfacing with the kernel
[11:35] <cwillu> sudoer: back up your home directory, and any other directories that might have stuff you need
[11:36] <chowmeined> nesoi: for example.. alt+sysctrl+b instantly reboots your computer (unsafe shutdown)
[11:36] <nesoi> chowmeined: yep, that should be enabled only when wanted, by developers and the like
[11:36] <Tigerman> guys, where in gconf-editor can i disable the tooltips i get when hovering the mouse pointer over an item in the Window List   ?
[11:36] <cwillu> racarter: you can install it, I'm just not sure what its called
[11:36] <gebruiker> hoiii
=== Kee1 is now known as Keef_
[11:36] <nesoi> chowmeined: just think about your grandmother using it... she hits the wrong keys and bang... all her work is gone
[11:36] <dystopianray> chowmeined: sysctrl = print-screen/sysrq ?
[11:36] <gebruiker> hello
[11:36] <gebruiker> how are you?
[11:36] <chowmeined> dystopianray: sysrq is what i meant
[11:37] <chowmeined> apologies
[11:37] <jxxt> sudoer, I would burn my data to disk first then do a clean install but I am no expert as you can tell by my response
[11:37] <cwillu> nesoi: not to argue against the point, but do you really think your grandmother is gonna be using three key keyboard shortcuts?
[11:37] <cwillu> nesoi: mine has trouble with 'shift' :p
[11:37] <_blitz_> i tried to install openobex but failed.i can give you the config.log file.can somebody please help me with it?
[11:37] <chowmeined> its enough trouble getting them to right click...
[11:37] <nesoi> cwillu: no, but she could hit some random keys by mistake or when trying to do something else
[11:38] <cwillu> chowmeined: I have more trouble getting people to left click for some reason
[11:38] <Tigerman> i have disabled the global panel tooltips, but they don't seem to disable the Window List and other tooltips, like Show Desktop Button tooltips and stuff...
[11:38] <Tigerman> please help
[11:38] <cybbah> Guys my audio don't work i had follow the wikies but don't work :( can you help me ... my audio device is an intel hda in a laptop acer 5720
[11:38] <mechdave> _blitz_: What are you trying to achieve with bluetooth?
[11:38] <racarter> does anyone use opera?
[11:38] <nesoi> the point is, crashing and losing your work potentially by mistake is Bad if it's really a consumer desktop
[11:38] <remus> racarter yes
[11:38] <aEv> Hi, the "screens and graphics" manager thingie doesnt seem to want to start. Anyone know the appname so i can see the error messages?
[11:38] <chowmeined> nesoi: windows should disable blue screens
[11:38] <_blitz_> connect to internet with my nokia phone
[11:38] <mechdave> chowmeined: lol
[11:38] <racarter> yes you use it or yes you think there is someone in the world actually using it
[11:38] <Arafangion> _blitz_: That's nothing.
[11:39] <nesoi> chowmeined: blue screens are a fatal error, obviously not the same thing at all
[11:39] <dystopianray> nesoi: you inadvertantly pressed ctrl+alt+backspace?
[11:39] <chowmeined> nesoi: except, you can design a system that never crashes
[11:39] <spnz> okei.. ran into another problem..Compiler version check failed. g++ 3.4 or later is needed
[11:39] <chowmeined> nesoi: not the fatal kernel error kind at least
[11:39] <_blitz_> why its nothing? i am a newbie.its something for me
[11:39] <spnz> how to get newer version ?;/
[11:39] <chowmeined> nesoi: so why not just do it?
[11:39] <nesoi> dystopianray: no, I did it as part of instructions for getting the front and back mouse buttons to work... it didn't say it was going to lose my session
[11:39] <mechdave> _blitz_: right first make sure your dongle works.. open a terminal and type sudo hcitool
[11:39] <cwillu> dystopianray: I've done it
[11:39] <Arafangion> nesoi: I never realised that ctrl+backspace deletes a word.  Must be a windows-ism.
[11:39] <_blitz_> ok
[11:40] <pipatron> Arafangion: it is
[11:40] <_blitz_> now i am in xp
[11:40] <chowmeined> dw deletes a word
[11:40] <nesoi> I suppose all my processes are children of x, so they go away if x reboots, but I didn't think of that
[11:40] <chowmeined> see.. dw == delete word
[11:40] <chowmeined> that makes sense
[11:40] <nesoi> and neither would grandma
[11:40] <_blitz_> but when i was in ubuntu a lsusb produced a positive result
[11:40] <pipatron> ctrl+w in insert
[11:40] <nanonyme> combinio, dw as in ^W?
[11:40] <mechdave> _blitz_: can you access the internet from ubuntu?
[11:40] <MaDiNfO_> hi does anyone knows why after upgrading to 7.10 ./configures cant find anything on include ?
[11:40] <dystopianray> nanonyme: dw is a vi command
[11:40] <_blitz_> no
[11:40] <racarter> is there any graphical utility in linux to do text compare?
[11:40] <cwillu> chowmeined: because the arrow keys are obviously misleading :p
[11:40] <nanonyme> ahm
[11:40] <chowmeined> cwillu: i like hjkl better...
[11:40] <cwillu> racarter: I use vbindiff, but it's terminal mode
[11:41] <racarter> na i am looking for graphical..
[11:41] <spnz> actually it wrote: CXX env variable is not set, attempting to use g++
[11:41] <chowmeined> MaDiNfO_: install build-essential?
[11:41] <MartinW> I uninstalled evolution. If I install the desktop-base package will I be able to upgrade?
[11:41] <cwillu> racarter: ignore what I said, I misread
[11:41] <combinio> nanonyme: ummm... what ? :)
[11:41] <spnz> so as far as I understand, i need to set CXX
[11:41] <nanonyme> combinio, i had no idea what dw was
[11:41] <racarter> i want some "lightweight" all purpose graphical text editor actually
[11:41] <spnz> which doesn't ring a bell to me ;/
[11:41] <cwillu> racarter: search synaptic for something with diff and gnome in the name
[11:41] <cwillu> racarter: gdiff might be something, taking a stab in the dark
[11:42] <mechdave> _blitz_: Ok this is how you basically do it... make sure your dongle works, make sure you can connect to your phone as dial up networking
[11:42] <chowmeined> here we go
[11:42] <combinio> nanonyme: and what DW is ? :] i've never asked about this 'dw' :P
[11:42] <MaDiNfO_> showmeined: its instaled
[11:42] <chowmeined> cwillu: nah.. i got it
[11:42] <chowmeined> racarter: http://meld.sourceforge.net/
[11:42] <janerik> cwillu: hi again. The only change is tha the screen looks different. But all the appz still working slow
[11:42] <racarter> i'll look but even still i think ill be using two programs
[11:42] <MaDiNfO_> chowmeined: is instaled
[11:42] <racarter> one for editing, one for comparing
[11:42] <cwillu> janerik: k, run the glxinfo line again, and tell me if direct rendering is yes or no
[11:42] <MartinW> !desktop-base
[11:42] <nanonyme> combinio, ah, tab completion error
[11:42] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about desktop-base - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[11:42] <chowmeined> MaDiNfO_: im not sure then...
[11:42] <nesoi> okay, thanks and bye all
[11:42] <combinio> nanonyme: ok ;]
[11:43] <mechdave> _blitz_: maybe a good idea to have a google around, as this subject has ots of info available on it :)
[11:43] <abhibera> any one know why am i getting this? Unable to exec gcc.real: No such file or directory
[11:43] <Cochise> anyone feel like helping me out with a gutsy internet probelm? it says connected but firefox wont load pages
[11:43] <cwillu> abhibera: is build-essential installed?
[11:43] <abhibera> yes
[11:43] <abhibera> cwillu: yes
[11:43] <janerik> cwillu: direct rendering is NO
[11:44] <cwillu> janerik: :/
[11:44] <lavender_dream> Cochise: Are you on the same computer with the issue and using Ubuntu?
[11:44] <xjkx> it says 7.04 is supported until 2008, if i keep doing apt-get upgrade until then, it will keep me on 7.04 right? just dist-upgrade will take me to gutsy ?
[11:44] <spnz> When trying to compile: CXX env variable is not set, attempting to use g++ Checking for g++ >= 3.4...No C++ compiler found! (cached) no Compiler version check failed. g++ 3.4 or later is needed
[11:44] <cwillu> xjkx: yes
[11:44] <chowmeined> xjkx: correct
[11:44] <Cochise> lavender_dream: nope on the same pc in windozes
[11:44] <cwillu> xjkx: no :p
[11:44] <spnz> how to get that g++
[11:44] <spnz> ?
[11:44] <mechdave> gharz: any good news yet?
[11:44] <xjkx> yes, correct, no... ?
[11:44] <pipatron> So hm. Why is my system permanently using xorg.conf.failsafe?
[11:44] <dromer> cwillu: w00t \o/ it worked :D
[11:44] <cwillu> xjkx: dist-upgrade isn't what it sounds like;  only update-manager will upgrade to gutsy; dist-upgrade wont
[11:44] <dromer> only problem now is thunderbird gave an error :S
[11:45] <jxxt> xjkx, no
[11:45] <janerik> cwillu: any Idea what it can be??? It worked great before upgrading:-(
[11:45] <mechdave> spnz: try apt-get install build-essential
[11:45] <chowmeined> cwillu: why not?
[11:45] <spnz> mechdave:  thanks
[11:45] <dromer> 'Could not find 'mozilla-thunderbird' executable.'
[11:45] <cwillu> janerik: you might need a videoram line in xorg.conf
[11:45] <mechdave> spnz: no worries
[11:45] <cwillu> chowmeined: dist-upgrade?
[11:45] <xjkx> anyway, apt-get upgrade won't take me to gutsy, right? this is the most important at all
[11:45] <chowmeined> cwillu: yes
[11:45] <lavender_dream> Cochise: To see whether it's a Firefox issue or your networking issue in Ubuntu, I'd check out Firefox preferences, Edit > Advanced > Network tab, and settings.
[11:45] <cwillu> chowmeined: dist-upgrade is just a smart package install, it doesn't actually change the repositories
[11:45] <aEv> Is anyone familiar with a malfunctioning 'screens and graphics' ? It doesnt want to start. Running "displayconfig-gtk" directly also gives interesting errors.
[11:46] <aEv> after gutsy upgrade
[11:46] <cwillu> chowmeined: it'll remove packages if necessary, but it won't ever look at the gutsy repo's
[11:46] <Turgon> Hello. I have been trying to make a PRO-NETS DM100A digital TV receiver work on Ubuntu 7.10 in my notebook, without success. I don't know which module (if there is one that would work) should I load nor which parameters should I use. The card' specifications can be found at http://www.pro-nets.com/eng/product.php?mode=show&cid=109&pid=143 , and my lspci output at http://pastebin.com/d2d803c33 . Thanks for you time and work.
[11:46] <cwillu> xjkx: yes
[11:46] <chowmeined> cwillu: right.. but if you change the sources.list then do dist-upgrade.. it works like normal yes?
[11:46] <jxxt> xjkx, apt-get update then when that finish do apt-get dist-upgrade and you will stay with feisty until you wish to change
[11:46] <cwillu> chowmeined: well, kinda
[11:46] <chowmeined> cwillu: excellent
[11:46] <Cochise> lavender_dream: i tried enabling ipv6 in firefox and it didnt help, when i type ethtool eth0 it says unknown interface
[11:46] <cwillu> chowmeined: the usual manual approach is to change the sources.list, dist-upgrade, then dpkg-reconfigure -all -phigh, and then dist-upgrade again, and then dpkg-reconfigure again, until dist-upgrade doesn't do anything anymore
[11:46] <nox-Hand> Anyone tell me what the nm-applet line in System -> Preferences -> Session -> Startup Programs is? I lost it. It's a quick find, anyone?
[11:46] <Cochise> lavender_dream: irc through pidgin wont work either so its a network issue id say
[11:47] <xjkx> uhmm, so everybody is agreeing that just update-manager gets me to gutsy ;) i'm feeling safer now :) what is it, apt-get update-manager or just update-manager ?
[11:47] <cwillu> chowmeined: the upgrade tool consists of workarounds for all the things that don't upgrade properly unless you do it in a particular fashion, or with the method I outlined
[11:47] <chowmeined> cwillu: ok
[11:47] <cwillu> xjkx: yes
=== gebruiker is now known as bartjee
[11:47] <janerik> cwillu: you think that will help? is the 7.1 so different? And how will i do that?:-)
[11:47] <IntuitiveNipple> nox-Hand: "nm-applet --sm-disable"
[11:47] <posingaspopular> xjkx: you should install via the commandline, most people seemto have sucess with that
[11:47] <cwillu> xjkx: apt-get won't ever upgrade to gutsy unless you change /etc/apt/sources.list by hand
[11:47] <lavender_dream> Cochise: oh doh, I'm sorry to  hear that, perhaps someone more knowledgable than me can help you with networking issue, I'm using a direct connection so it's hard for me to say myself having only used Ubuntu for about a month.
[11:48] <Linnk> Hi, I just bought a USB to Parallel Port cable to connect my old printer to my computer, but apparently CUPS can't find the printer at all, any hints on how to solve this?
[11:48] <cwillu> janerik: honestly I'm not dead sure;  hard to say without knowing what your config was pre-gutsy
[11:48] <murlidhar> somebody please help me compile a qtella application!!!!!!
[11:48] <lavender_dream> !network
[11:48] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:48] <jxxt> xlkx, update manager is a graphic on your desktop system/admin/update manager
[11:48] <xjkx> ah, then what the hell dist-upgrade is used for ??
[11:48] <michel_> hello. i think there is a problem with open office 2.3 in gutsy. when i open a document with calc and close it, calc crashes and after confirming the crash writer is started. can someone confirm this?
[11:48] <abhibera> ANYONE KNOW WHY MY GCC IS NOT WORKING?
[11:48] <cwillu> janerik: you restarted x, right?
[11:48] <[chr0n0s]]> anyone knows a application for multiple clocks in xfce ?
[11:48] <mechdave> Cochise: Have a look at /etc/networking/interfaces, is eth0 in there?
[11:48] <chowmeined> abhibera: nope sorry
[11:48] <cwillu> abhibera: no idea
[11:48] <Cochise> lavender_dream: i have a direct connection too through my network card to the modem, its fine in feisty but not in gutsy its a pity because gutsy is really quick on my pc
[11:49] <posingaspopular> xjkx: dist-upgrade gets you from feisty to gutsy
[11:49] <jxxt> xlkx, dist-upgrase is a "smart" version of upgrade
[11:49] <cwillu> posingaspopular: no no no
[11:49] <remus> abhibera dont cpas abuse
[11:49] <posingaspopular> abhibera: what is gcc?
[11:49] <jxxt> upgrade

[11:51] <mechdave> Cochise: Ok
[11:51] <murlidhar> cwillu: i was asking nicely
[11:51] <posingaspopular> steph_: the OS installer and all the packages you need
[11:51] <cwillu> abhibera: I don't have a gcc.real on my system at all, and I know gcc works properly on it
[11:51] <posingaspopular> so you can install everything without connecting to the internet. iirc
[11:51] <erUSUL> abhibera: are you running gcc from command line?
[11:51] <steph_> there are just more packages than on the Live CD ?

[11:52] <abhibera> erUSUL: i run gcc from cmd line
[11:52] <xjkx> dist-upgrade is smarter on what, I've used it, then i can guess it is smarter because it upgrades also kernels and stuff, am i right?
[11:52] <wimdows> So in compiz I now get a two sided plane instead of a cube...
[11:52] <cab_> qualcuno riesce a fare girare urban terror su un 64 bit ?

[11:52] <steph_> ooooh
[11:52] <mechdave> gharz: What is the cpu doing?
[11:52] <lavender_dream> Cochise: you'll get it fixed, just a matter of time and diligence, I'm sorry to hear that really.. have you checked out what I personally use is pppoe so I go to terminal and type ppoeconf and my connection starts automatically from each bootup.
[11:52] <gharz> mechdave: yes... i don't know what happened...
[11:52] <steph_> I didn't know.
[11:53] <erUSUL> abhibera: i've never seen this error... what's the output of 'which gcc.real' ??

[11:53] <gharz> mechdave: sorry, but i don't know how to check my cpu?
[11:53] <murlidhar> cwillu: sorry then if u felt i wasn't asking nicely cuz english isn't my native language
[11:53] <jxxt> xlkx, yes
[11:53] <steph_> so the 4.6 Gb of the DVD contains just a lotta packages ?

[11:53] <cwillu> murlidhar: your best bet is to find the site or channel dedicated to the package you need to build
[11:53] <cwillu> murlidhar: compiling is a bit advanced for this channel
[11:53] <janerik> cwillu: yeas, reastarted the whole computer

[11:56] <cwillu> Tigerman: acpi=force I believe
[11:56] <Tigerman> where exactly do i have to add the acpi=forced  line?
[11:56] <zetheroo> there is something called "trackerd" running in the processes list.... its constantly taking up 50% or more of my CPU power!!!! What is it and why is it SO darn hungry???
[11:56] <jxxt> xlkx, by then you will want a different version iIguess
[11:56] <xjkx> let's guess gutsy has kde version x.x, then feitsy will always have kde version x.x -1 ? or being on gutsy/feitsy doesn't affect the packages themselves in versions ?
[11:57] <Tigerman> where exactly do i have to add the acpi=force  line?

[11:57] <weltall> did someone update to gnome 2.20.1 (from gutsy-proposed)? and does anyone know what this package is for (ubufox)?
[11:58] <abhibera> cwillu: i was getting a BROKEN LINK on gcc.real. so i did a apt-get install gcc-4.1 --reinstall and problem solved :)
[11:58] <cwillu> murlidhar: check synaptic for a package that has libqt-something-dev
[11:58] <gabbarinho> does the non-live CD installation feature a graphical interface?

[11:58] <Gnontghol> does the ssh client have ipv6 support?
[11:58] <murlidhar> cwillu: got it it's libqt4-dev

[11:59] <gabbarinho> great, I hope it works

[12:07] <cwillu> spnz: I'm looking at the package in synaptic;  it may not be official, but it's 'official' for ubuntu :p
[12:07] <cwillu> spnz: all that means is that the people who wrote it don't release binaries
[12:07] <mechdave> gharz: Oh ok, I don't know what may be wrong then... have a look at how much memory you have free, and how much swap is being used
[12:08] <nosrednaekim> [chr0n0s]: did you install xserver-xgl?
[12:08] <spnz> so it's possible to download via synaptics?
[12:08] <[chr0n0s]> nosrednaekim, nope, and how do i check it if it is there
[12:08] <cwillu> spnz: it should be;  it's in the list at least
[12:08] <cwillu> spnz: notably, after all the kernel gunk :p

[12:08] <murlidhar> janerik: sorry i couldn't tell u to save anything before pressing ctrl alt backspace

[12:09] <zetheroo> how do I stop the trackerd process?
[12:09] <zhanx> nice someone throws a gundam link out and i am doing a model of  one right now

[12:09] <cwillu> janerik: aka, about to go to bed
[12:09] <shosholoza> can somebody help me, my gutsy live cd doesn't boot, after the kernel loading the notebook is rebooting
[12:09] <spnz> hmmm
[12:09] <spnz> that's weird
[12:09] <spnz> I have all repositories anabled
[12:09] <Cochise> mechdave: can i grab ya for a sec?
[12:10] <kadakas> I formatted a 200 GB drive (with 1 partition) to ext3 using "mke2fs -j /dev/sda1", but when i mounted it using "mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /media/sda1" and used "df -h", then the drive was just 20 GB ?!
[12:10] <janerik> Cwillu: thanks for trying to help:-)
[12:10] <spnz> but can't find it :)

[12:12] <spnz> cwillu: thank you, tryin that
[12:12] <cwillu> spnz: you can download the package from there
[12:12] <rom> can someone copy me /etc/apt/sources.list from a clean install of gutsy please
[12:12] <shosholoza> zhanx, but i think its a kernel problem, cause the normal kernel on feisty doesn't running too. only the kernel 2.6.17-10 is running
[12:12] <mechdave> gharz: try removing auto eth1 in /etc/networking/interfaces
[12:12] <abhibera> i have a budget of max $1000

[12:13] <gharz> mechdave: ok.

[12:13] <cwillu> abhibera: I'm just bought a bunch of acer aspire 3690's, they all work fine with effects and wireless (ndiswrapper)
[12:13] <Shaffox> Guys, I guess the wireless problems are a kernel problem, 'cause in 2.6.20-16-generic it works perfect.
[12:13] <cwillu> abhibera: 670 including taxes
[12:13] <zhanx> shosholoza,  if its a kernel then its beyond me
[12:13] <spnz> yea, but I'm using feisty fawn
[12:13] <spnz> maybe that's the case
[12:13] <abhibera> cwillu: i'm looking at desktop
[12:13] <abhibera> cwillu: and CUSTOM MADE
[12:13] <abhibera> cwillu: no DELL and COMPAQ and ACER
[12:13] <Cochise> mechdave: hopefully ill tell you it worked from gutsy, talk to ya in 5 either way
[12:14] <cwillu> abhibera: just find a good local supplier
[12:14] <nosrednaekim> abhibera: then look on newegg
[12:14] <abhibera> what config should i take?
[12:14] <Ind[y]> I use Gutsy. I have selected "manual configuration" in the network manager, and I am connected to a wireless network. But now, instead of the connection-quality bars, a computer screen appears in the panel. But in this way, I can't see the quality of the wireless connection.
[12:14] <pipatron> abhibera: I LIKE TO SCREAM TOO
[12:14] <Ind[y]> Is there a way I can see it?
[12:14] <zhanx> abhibera, tigerdirect, newegg, pricewatch
[12:14] <cwillu> abhibera: and please get over your capslock addiction :p
[12:14] <mechdave> Cochise: No worries
[12:14] <abhibera> nosrednaekim: what config should i take?
[12:14] <Ind[y]> I mean, the percentage of the connectivity (how good or bad is the wireless signal caught).
[12:15] <remix5x> im trying to search for something on the ubuntu forums, how do i make it search for ALL keywords and not just some?
[12:15] <cwillu> abhibera: I'd strongly suggest finding a good local supplier;  it's hard to beat local service;  I'd expect you can get a good machine for 5-800, and an lcd for another 150-200
[12:15] <nosrednaekim> abhibera: IDK, just don't get anything with an ATI,
[12:15] <abhibera> nosrednaekim: Core2Duo. 2GB RAM, 200GB SATA, What Graphics?
[12:15] <cwillu> remix5x: just google, with the site:ubuntuforums.org or whichever

I can see the files in /var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/.  Am I doing it wrong?  Or does something need to be linked for it to read the gems
[12:15] <spnz> cwillu:  maybe the problem is due my usage of feisty fawn?\
[12:15] <Huffameg> hi.. i want to use the dictionary applet in ubuntu. where can I find a french dictionary source?

[12:16] <abhibera> nosrednaekim: any particular model? i don't game too much. i'm more a dev. i just want everything working when i put in gutsy.
[12:16] <zhanx> shosholoza, i tried the live cd first and it didnt work on my laptop it kept rebooting.. no clue why i just switched to the alt and it worked fine
[12:16] <abhibera> nosrednaekim: i want desktop effects :)
[12:16] <cwillu> spnz: ah, sorry;  I thought you said you were running gutsy
[12:16] <cwillu> spnz: ya, that'll do it
[12:16] <nosrednaekim> abhibera: the cheapest then ;) or you could just go with an integrated nvidia
[12:16] <Bjerregaa> Hello there
[12:17] <cwillu> abhibera: integrated intel works pretty well these days
[12:17] <abhibera> cwillu: even 950 GMA?
[12:17] <Joel_vx> Howdy all
[12:17] <shosholoza> zhanx, but i tried it with the feisty alt, but in the same moment the notebook was rebooting
[12:17] <Blou_Aap> ne 1 here to help me ?
[12:17] <espen> Is   there any way to make the system go back to an earlier date_
[12:17] <gharz> mechdave: thanks for the help!!! got to go... i'll check again my connection later.
[12:17] <abhibera> cwillu: i'm running Beryl on a 950 GMA. it's a little sluggish at times

[12:17] <kondor101> anyone got any info on usb storage?
[12:18] <kane77> abhibera, I can tell that there were no problems with my integrated intel 950.. I'm running compiz fusion and it works well
[12:18] <cwillu> abhibera: on the other hand, the requirements for really good 3d desktop is about the same as respectable games performance
[12:18] <pipatron> kondor101: What info
[12:18] <abhibera> cwillu: ah.... but definitely not looking for integrated. i want a discrete graphics adapter
[12:18] <cwillu> abhibera: why?
[12:18] <fish> how do i change from kdm to gdm?
[12:18] <abelabel> when trying to upgrade my current ubuntu installation (7.04, ubuntu studio) to 7.10, I get the following message: Failed to fetch http://debian.tagancha.org/debian/dists/dapper/Release Unable to find expected entry  restricted/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)
[12:18] <abhibera> cwillu: not quite. the desktop just displays simple rectangles. there aren't too many triangles to be bothered about like a game
[12:19] <kondor101> pipatron, i used to use 7.04  in 7.04 if i connected my PSP it came up just like an ipod,  now it just isn't seeing it on 7.10
[12:19] <cwillu> abhibera: the desktop does alot of heavy texture processing
[12:19] <abelabel> I'm getting this message when trying to upgrade from Ubuntu Studio 7.04 to Ubuntu 7.10: Failed to fetch http://debian.tagancha.org/debian/dists/dapper/Release Unable to find expected entry  restricted/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?)
[12:19] <zhanx> abelabel, try changing your sources location
[12:19] <pipatron> I'm running a 3D desktop on my Thinkpad X40 with a slow integrated intel card
[12:19] <pipatron> It's definately fast enough
[12:19] <abhibera> cwillu: yea but games do a lot more than that. :)
[12:19] <abelabel> zhankx: could you expand on that?
[12:19] <[chr0n0s]> nosrednaekim, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41323/
[12:19] <shosholoza> zhanx, i will tried it with the gutsy cd, if it doesn't work, do you have an idea, what can i do than
[12:19] <pipatron> Trying to play GTA3 in even the lowest resolution - doesn't work.
[12:19] <kondor101> anyone got a psp handy and 7.10 ?
[12:19] <cwillu> abelabel: slow down, I wasn't even halfway through writing a resopnse
[12:20] <abelabel> (sorry for posting twice)
[12:20] <zhanx> abelabel, system - admin - software sources - download from
[12:20] <cwillu> abelabel: remove the entry about dapper
[12:20] <regebro> OK, so the upgrade failed when installing the packages. The result: Ubuntu thinks it's 7.10, but I'm nore sure it really is. What do I do now?
[12:20] <zhanx> shosholoza, reformat - backup first
[12:20] <cwillu> abhibera: depends on the game, but none the less, the texture mapping is something that is noticable better on better cards
[12:21] <remix5x> It would be so awesome and would draw SO MANY people to linux if ubuntu could come preinstalled with wine and imports the windows registry from windows and allow you to use all pre-exisitng windows applications straight from the windows partition!
[12:21] <nosrednaekim> [chr0n0s]: "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"
[12:21] <cwillu> abhibera: on the other hand, it works fine on my integrated intel :p
[12:21] <shosholoza> zhanx, thank you
[12:21] <abhibera> cwillu: yea... the antialiasing is better on a discrete graphics card. u don't see jaggies
[12:21] <remix5x> I know its possible, and i'm quite frankly surprised that anyone hasn't though about it or done a readme on how to do it yet
[12:21] <abhibera> cwillu: but it's not so bad on a integrated card
[12:21] <kadakas> dystopianray: it worked! thx :)
[12:21] <gorski> pidgin: msn problem in Gutsy - waiting for network connection.
[12:21] <cwillu> abhibera: that's not a function of the integration, it's a function of the chipset
[12:22] <regebro> I've looked for some help on how to restart the upgrade or at least make sure that it actually worked, even though it sais it failed, but nothing....
[12:22] <abhibera> cwillu: ye
[12:22] <abhibera> a
[12:22] <nosrednaekim> remix5x: but do we want that? a free replacement for windows? shouldn;t people switch to linux on its own rights? Off topic too ;)
[12:22] <Joel_vx> whats the difference between 'apt-get' and 'aptitude' VS synamptic? for example, command line utils dont show up under synaptic, but i can install them via apt-get... I thought they all use the same repositories?
[12:22] <kondor101> no help at all? this is strange, usually your such helpful guys
[12:22] <zhanx> remix5x, that would mean i have to have a windows install
[12:22] <Blou_Aap_> any one know why terminal window goes all white when desk effects are enabled ?

[12:27] <Shadow_Fi> hi all
[12:27] <Shadow_Fi> i need some help
[12:27] <dystopianray> Joel_vx: you've drawn a conclusion ffrom a number that you don't understand
[12:27] <Ubuntu-newb> IdleOne what does that command do ?
[12:28] <Cochise> Tigerman: history -c
[12:28]  * remus just codes till he falls asleep at the pc
[12:28] <Tigerman> thanks
[12:28] <voraz>  i need help 2
[12:28] <cwillu> nosrednaekim: last thing update-manager does if the gutsy upgrade fails is undoes the modifications to /etc/apt/sources.list, unless it dies _really_ badly
[12:28] <nosrednaekim> kjalil: same here. no fix that i can find.
[12:28] <regebro> cwillu: But sources list has been updated...
[12:28] <Joikast1>  Can someone help me enable the graphics driver in Restricted Drivers Manager? It does not work.. I have a geforce fx5200 card and it says: "The software source for the package nvidia-glx-new is not enabled"...
[12:28] <voraz> how to install ubuntu ? xD
[12:28] <IdleOne> Ubuntu-newb: lets you choose new splash screen and such
[12:28] <Extravert> hello my sound isnt working.  I dont think my sound card is detected
[12:28] <mechdave> Cochise: You got eth0 working!
[12:28] <kondor101> cwillu  udevmonitor, i just ran it in terminal and it seems to be doing nothing
[12:28] <cwillu> regebro: then you need to apt-get dist-upgrade, and then dpkg-reconfigure -all -phigh, and keep doing both of those until dist-upgrade doesn't upgrade anything anymore
[12:28] <Cochise> mechdave: pidgin, firefox gmail-notifer none of them connect
[12:28] <Shadow_Fi> i cant connect to my wireless modem!
[12:29] <cwillu> kondor101: i.e., nothing shows up when you plug in the psp?
[12:29] <regebro> cwillu: Super, thanks!
[12:29] <kjalil> nosrednaekim: ok, thanks, i have other problems too. when booting up, i need to remove 'splash' from kernel line otherwise the screen goes blank
[12:29] <cwillu> regebro: no guarantees :)
[12:29] <nosrednaekim> !info nvidia-glx-new
[12:29] <ubotu> nvidia-glx-new: NVIDIA binary XFree86 4.x/X.Org 'new' driver. In component restricted, is optional. Version 100.14.19+2.6.22.4-14.9 (gutsy), package size 4896 kB, installed size 14848 kB
[12:29] <Joel_vx> dystopianray: ubuntu usage or vista ?
[12:29] <mechdave> Cochise: Ok now you have to make sure that you have the right DNS in /etc/resolv.conf
[12:29] <cwillu> regebro: but that's the standard approach. you might find some things still work oddly afterwards
[12:29] <nosrednaekim> Joikast1: make sure you have the restrcicted repository enabled
[12:29] <kondor101> cwillu, yes nothing shows up
[12:29] <Tigerman> what is acpi
[12:29] <Ubuntu-newb> IdleOne this is what I get when I enter the command:   There is only 1 program which provides usplash-artwork.so
[12:29] <Ubuntu-newb> (/usr/lib/usplash/usplash-theme-ubuntu.so). Nothing to configure.
[12:29] <Ubuntu-newb> update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-generic
[12:29] <cwillu> kondor101: :/
[12:29] <remus> !acpi
[12:29] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about acpi - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[12:29] <Shadow_Fi> i try connect using, wep 64 hex, and give the password, it is trying to connect, after few minutes asks passcode again, and again...
[12:29] <Cochise> mechdave no prob back in a sec again
[12:29] <dystopianray> Joel_vx: well both, you've just taken two numbers and decided ubuntu was better, witout knowing what the numbers actually mean

[12:30] <janerik> PLEASE HELP:-) Anyone have an Idea Why my computer is working extreme slow after upgrading to 7.10???
[12:30] <elliotjhug> janerik: whats your hardware like?
[12:30] <Jo3> Cochise, would sh /home/brian/torrents/ETQW-client-1.1.r8.x86.run be correct?
[12:30] <kjalil> does anyone know how to get a static address on your wireless connection?
[12:30] <cwillu> janerik: elliotjhug:  it's a direct rendering issue, I tried troubleshooting it, but didn't make much headway
[12:30] <dystopianray> Jo3: if that is the correct to the file, then yes
[12:30] <cwillu> elliotjhug: on the other hand, I haven't slept in a while
[12:30] <remix5x> I have a great idea for ubuntu.... why dosen't someone write a script to install wine and import all windows registry keys into wine registry and create a link for all windows programs under the ubuntu start menu so you can run all pre existing windows programs right off of the ubuntu start menu without extra configuration?
[12:31] <cwillu> kondor101: worked under feisty?
[12:31] <cwillu> kondor101: did you upgrade or fresh install?
[12:31] <janerik> elliotjhug:2ghz cpu, 512ram, 80 gb hd
[12:31] <dystopianray> kjalil: does your access point support static dhcp leases? that is the easiest way
[12:31] <Shadow_Fi> any clue?
[12:31] <kondor101> cwillu, no problems on 7.04
[12:31] <pipatron> remix5x: Go ahead
[12:31] <elliotjhug> cwillu: fair enough - I'll take a look.
[12:31] <Tigerman> what is acpi?
[12:31] <zhanx> kjalil, you manually configure?
[12:31] <zilchy> Running Gutsy, my sound works (ALSA) on the desktop but when I try to use Mixxx using the ALSA API it tells me that the "Audio device could not be opened".  Works in OSS, but I need multiple channels so I can use the cue output.  Any tips?
[12:31] <dystopianray> remix5x: because it's unlikely to work
[12:31] <voraz> does anybody know how to install 7.10 i downloaded the iso file and ive got poweriso, what now?
[12:31] <Jo3> dystopianray, ok well, when i type that I get : Cannot execute binary file
[12:31] <cwillu> kondor101: I'd try it under a gutsy live cd, just to rule out any issues with the actual install
[12:31] <elliotjhug> janerik: OK, I assume you are using desktop effects if we're talking direct rendering. What's your graphics card?
[12:31] <FreeFull> What should I know before upgrading to Gutsy?
[12:31] <Shadow_Fi> i try connect using wlan, wep 64 hex, and give the passcode (10 digits), it is trying to connect, after few minutes asks passcode again, and again...
[12:31] <remix5x> pipatron, i can't I don't posess the technical knowledge
[12:31] <dystopianray> voraz: burn it and boot it
[12:31] <zilchy> voraz, burn the ISO to a disc and boot
[12:31] <nosrednaekim> voraz: did you burn the iso?
=== prapatan_rebel is now known as pika_chan
[12:32] <voraz> just copy the iso file on a cd?
[12:32] <nosrednaekim> FreeFull: you have the right to remain silent ;)
[12:32] <zilchy> be sure not to burn the ISO as a data file
[12:32] <zilchy> :-P
[12:32] <Pickle_Weasel> hmm, is it still possible to update from 5.10? I am trying to follow the update page, but failing horribly.
[12:32] <voraz> oh :(
[12:32] <Ubuntu-newb> voraz: You have to burn it as an Image-CD and then you change your bootsequence to include CD as 1st Boot Device... then you can boot from CD
[12:32] <kondor101> cwillu, i think i can see whats happening, 2 secs
[12:32] <dystopianray> Jo3: cd into the direct and run: chmod +x ETQW-client-1.1.r8.x86.run
[12:32] <remus> remix5x because linux is about freedom and wiindowz is about DRM
[12:32] <Tigerman> what is acpi? and why does is my motherboard telling me i need to force acpi in able to enable it?
[12:32] <remix5x> dystopianray, It most certainly is.... I ran warcraft 3 on ubuntu from my existing windows partition simply by writing the registry keys into wine registry
[12:32] <kjalil> zhanx: i did that, in System/Administration/Network and then disabled roaming and then set a static IP with WPA key, etc and it doesn't work
[12:32] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: you'll have to upgrade to 6.06, and then 6.10, and then 7.04, and then 7.10, in turn
[12:32] <janerik> elliotjhug: No desktop effects..... My graphicscard???:-) Hp compac laptop:-)
[12:32] <Extravert> hello my sound isnt working.  I dont think my sound card is detected
[12:32] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: the 6.06 upgrade will probably be the worst of the bunch
[12:32] <dystopianray> remix5x: it is unlikely to work for much else
[12:33] <Pickle_Weasel> cwillu: that is that i am attempting to do, 6.06 atm, but i keep getting the message "your version is no longer supported"
[12:33] <elliotjhug> janerik: OK, well whats the graphics card in it. It might be Intel, Nvidia or ATI?
[12:33] <remix5x> remus: I know, but ubuntu is trying to appeal to windows users and the average joe... and the average joe wants at least some windows programs to run in linux... thats what most windows users try to do after trying linux
[12:33] <Tigerman> If for some reason you have enabled your root account and wish to disable it again, open a terminal and issue the following command:
[12:33] <Tigerman> sudo passwd -l root
[12:33] <cwillu> elliotjhug: looks like he was using i810 originally
[12:33] <voraz> my cd is 1st boot device, but burning the cd, with what and how
[12:33] <lonnie> anyone know if it is necessary to upgrade to the final release of 7.10 from the RC? if so, how would I go about doing that?
[12:33] <dystopianray> Jo3: cd into the directory i mean
[12:33] <compwiz18> is anyone else having problems with their ranodm programs randomly stopping taking input from their keyboard on Gutsy?
[12:33] <zhanx> kjalil your router support static dhcp by mac?
[12:33] <janerik> elliotjhug:intel
[12:33] <Shadow_Fi> i try connect using wlan, wep 64 hex, and give the passcode (10 digits), it is trying to connect, after few minutes asks passcode again, and again...
[12:33] <dystopianray> lonnie: sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:33] <Tigerman> is root account disable by default in Gutsy??
[12:33] <IdleOne> lonnie: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[12:33] <Tigerman> is root account disabled by default in Gutsy??
[12:33] <dystopianray> Tigerman: yes
[12:33] <Tigerman> If for some reason you have enabled your root account and wish to disable it again, open a terminal and issue the following command:
[12:33] <Tigerman> sudo passwd -l root
[12:33] <zilchy> Tigerman, yes. use sudo
[12:33] <elliotjhug> cwillu: OK. Odd that direct rendering would have an effect without using desktop effects..
[12:33] <remix5x> dystopianray, wine has a large database of windows programs that work with it... anything that works with wine should work... all you need are the registry keys
[12:33] <Shadow_Fi> i try connect using wlan, wep 64 hex, and give the passcode (10 digits), it is trying to connect, after few minutes asks passcode again, and again... like the passcode would be wrong, but its not...
[12:33] <lonnie> thank you both, will try ASAP
[12:33] <kjalil> zhanx: umm, no idea
[12:33] <zhanx> Shadow_Fi,  manually configure it and try all the options with wep type
[12:33] <cwillu> elliotjhug: hmm, I thought his issue was mostly desktop effect related;
[12:34] <Tigerman> ok thanks
[12:34] <IdleOne> lonnie: if there is packages to upgrade it will if it does not upgrade any packages then you are already at final release
[12:34] <Shadow_Fi> tried..
[12:34] <Shadow_Fi> didnt work
[12:34] <elliotjhug> cwillu: He just said he's not using them.. I'll check
[12:34] <oling> nosrednaekim: XGL gave me software emulated opengl experience
[12:34] <wimdows> compwiz18, I had that before on a 7.04 install on a different machine
[12:34] <Blou_Aap_> can anyone help me ?
[12:34] <Joikast1>  Can someone help me enable the graphics driver in Restricted Drivers Manager? It does not work.. I have a geforce fx5200 card and it says: "The software source for the package nvidia-glx-new is not enabled"...
[12:34] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: hmm
[12:34] <zhanx> hmm.. it comnnect with no wep?
[12:34] <nosrednaekim> oling: is that good?
[12:34] <elliotjhug> janerik: Can you go System, Preferences, Appearance for me please?
[12:34] <alain> ei just ,,, i just wanna ask regarding this gnome-lokkit.. is it good to install it?
[12:34] <wimdows> compwiz18, never knew what took away the focus tho or how to fix it :-(
[12:34] <bottiger> I just upgraded to gutsy on my desktop. But unlike my laptop it didn't install apparmor, stringi, etc. However the splash-screen and artwork is all gutys
[12:34] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: I'm not sure if you can directly upgrade via the tool anymore (you might be able to, I just don't know)
[12:34] <Shadow_Fi> dont know, didnt try to turn WEP off
[12:34] <zilchy> Joikast, enable the restricted driver repository in synaptic and try again.
[12:34] <oling> nosrednaekim: it's slow as hell. 1 video frame per second
[12:34] <compwiz18> wimdows, were you on amd64 by chance
[12:34] <Tigerman> sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
[12:35] <zhanx> well...

[12:35] <Genetics> [Google] Desc: ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an open industry specification co-developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba that defines a flexible ...
[12:35] <wimdows> compwiz18, yep AMD64 Athlon
[12:35] <voraz> so i have to extract the files from the iso file and then copy them to cd ?
[12:35] <janerik> elliotjhug: Yes I will try all for good help:-) hold on
[12:35] <Blou_Aap_>                              help me ?    :'(
[12:35] <Shadow_Fi> can i just search all availeble networks in area, like in Windows?
[12:35] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: if you can't, then you can still just change all the references to warty to dapper in /etc/sources.list, and the apt-get dist-upgrade, and the dpkg-reconfigure -all -phigh, and keep doing both of those until it seems done
[12:35] <oling> nosrednaekim: you mean the closed source (restricted) ATI driver?
[12:35] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: make sure you have a backup of anything you can't afford to lose first
[12:35] <nosrednaekim> oling: yup
[12:35] <compwiz18> wimdows, with x64 ubuntu?
[12:35] <Jo3> dystopianray, ok I did that, and now it sits at the console with a black blinking box, instead of the normal " | "
[12:35] <remus> remix5x: actually, i am currently trying to build my own distro from scratch. I hate windows. I hate windows programs. THere is always an alternative opensource, and i do not syppathize with those who want linux but not to put the effort in to learn using it. The documentation is out there.
[12:35] <cwillu> Pickle_Weasel: if you can just reinstall straight to 7.10, you'll save yourself many many hours
[12:35] <wimdows> compwiz18, nope - 32 bit
[12:36] <kondor101> anypne else lost a usb port on 7.10?
[12:36] <alain> guys just wanna ask about this firewall thing... gnome-lokkit is it reald needed to install this firewalls?
[12:36] <zhanx> when you click the icon for network it should show the availible ones
[12:36] <oling> nosrednaekim: i think ATI dropped the support for my ATI 9200 mobility. at least it doesn't work out of the box
[12:36] <Shadow_Fi> can i just search all availeble wireless networks in area, like in Windows?
[12:36] <compwiz18> wimdows, ok, do you think reinstalling would help?
[12:36] <Cochise> mechdave: resolv.conf has nameserver and the correct ip on both lines
[12:36] <Pickle_Weasel> cwillu: i'll try both, thanks =)
[12:36] <zhanx> Shadow_Fi,  when you click the icon for network it should show the availible ones
[12:36] <nosrednaekim> oling: ah.. sorry,you may want to uninstall xgl then ;)
[12:36] <oling> nosrednaekim: or i did something wrong

[12:36] <voraz> lol
[12:36] <kondor101> see ya
[12:36] <mechdave> Cochise: Ok... thinking...

[12:37] <remix5x> remus, last time it was, but now i can't fine it....
[12:37] <techknow> can someone recommend a screencast app for ubuntu?
[12:37] <kondor101> anyone fancy helping figure out my lost usb port problem?
[12:37] <oling> nosrednaekim: anyway. was a good suggestion. too bad it doesn't work
[12:37] <zhanx> Shadow_Fi,  reset your wireless to roaming
[12:37] <hetauma_> hi using screens and graphics on my laptop and trying to set up a second screen. It seems that this tool only sees the tv-out of my laptop and not my vga-out. any ideas?
[12:37] <Lustblader> techknow: there is a built in screenshot app
[12:37] <Cochise> mechdave: i read on the forums about typing about:config and then searching for ipv and enable ipv6 but that didnt work and i turned it both on and off whiile tryiong both your suggestions
[12:37] <zilchy> hetauma_: isn't that automatic?
[12:37] <Shadow_Fi> zhanx, did that
[12:37] <wimdows> compwiz18,  it may well do, I farted around a lot on that machine with XGL, Beryl and stuff and got random screen distortions after logging in and X would reset.....
[12:37] <techknow> screencast == video Lustblader

[12:38] <techknow> Lustblader: thanks anyway
[12:38] <zhanx> get your adapter from iwconfig
[12:38] <hetauma_> zilchy, automatic?
[12:38] <Shadow_Fi> zhanx, when i manually try to connect, it shows my network with 0% signall
[12:38] <mechdave> Cochise: That is to do with firefox, your problem is with the system
[12:38] <elliotjhug> janerik: you there?
[12:38] <Shadow_Fi> zhanx, when in windows i have 80%
[12:38] <oling> alain: why do you want a firewall?
[12:38] <nosrednaekim> zhanx: "ifconfig adapter up/down
[12:38] <IdleOne> techknow: search in Synaptic
[12:38] <zilchy> hetauma_: yeah, it was with my old laptop, plug in the VGA and it works, no messing with software.
[12:38] <mechdave> Cochise: Hang on shall do some research
[12:38] <janerik> elliotjhug: yes I'm there:-)
[12:38] <nosrednaekim> oling: with or without the proprietary drivers>
[12:38] <elliotjhug> janerik: OK, which option is selected?
[12:38] <alain> its said here to protect from intruders
[12:39] <zhanx> nosrednaekim, you can throw them both on there like that.. cool
[12:39] <janerik> elliotjhug:None
[12:39] <oling> nosreadnaekim: on 7.04 i used the free ATI driver
[12:39] <JimQode> alain, if you don't run services like ssh you don't need it
[12:39] <Joikast1> Can someone please help me enable the graphics driver in Restricted Drivers Manager? It does not work.. I have a geforce fx5200 card and it says: "The software source for the package nvidia-glx-new is not enabled"..
[12:39] <dystopianray> alain: are you running network services on untrusted networks?
[12:39] <Shadow_Fi> zhanx, anyway, i tried all that from live cd Ubuntu 7.1
[12:39] <zilchy> Joikast, enable the restricted driver repository in synaptic and try again.
[12:39] <elliotjhug> janerik: OK, can you close that. Open a terminal. And then let me know when you've done that
[12:39] <alain> ahh okies
[12:39] <nosrednaekim> zhanx: no... you can't... but the adapter goes FIRST
[12:39] <oling> nosreadnaekim: but i hadn't compiz running
[12:39] <daniel25500> bonjour
[12:39] <Joikast1> I dont know how to do that ?
[12:39] <alain> tnx
[12:39] <Cochise> mechdave: i though so, just to let you know it works perfectly in feisty and the gutsy rc. just not in gutsy final, i redownloaded the iso thinking maybe bad download or burn but i burnt at 2x and still no luck, cheers for the help
[12:39] <zhanx> oh yea..

[12:41] <Extravert> hello I get this error from volume control. No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.

[12:41] <dystopianray> folkert: did you install the nvidia binary driver?
[12:41] <zilchy> stitchlin: yeah, my kernel got screwed when I upgraded, went and did a fresh install after that (since the install was only a week old)
[12:41] <compwiz18> wimdows, *sigh* I was hoping that wouldn't be the answer ;)
[12:41] <folkert> No, swap uses 182 mb
[12:41] <Extravert> Lustblader: seems installed
[12:41] <IdleOne> techknow: already in the repos for your installing enjoyment :)
[12:41] <folkert> Yes I installed the NVIDIA driver

[12:42] <techknow> IdleOne: I found a solution on lifehacker
[12:42] <wimdows> compwiz18, did a Google search turn up anything?
[12:42] <Joikast1> wimwdows: and then?
[12:42] <jxxt> Extravert, also gstreamer plugins they are in "add remove" on you desktop
[12:42] <stitchlin> im tring to not todo that Zilchy
[12:42] <IdleOne> techknow: whatever works for you
[12:42] <JimQode> compwiz18, does turning off compiz help?
[12:42] <shnastybiznastic> I hate to take up everyone's time with this, but is there any way to disable the screens and graphics application?  I'm trying to recreate the functionality of my old xorg.conf from Fiesty and that application adding in another layer of mess isn't helping.

[12:42] <oling> after i removed xserver-xgl compiz is not working anymore
[12:42] <elliotjhug> janerik: OK, thats great. Next time I ask you to run a command like that make sure you include the whole thing though. The | grep direct bit would have let me get the answer I needed in a single line. Give me a moment.
[12:42] <folkert> Should I install gstreaner pitffd

[12:46] <oling> zilchy: so it's a alsa problem, no mixxx problem...
[12:46] <mefiXe> is there anybody that has compiz|beryl running with fglrx on gutsy??
[12:46] <Joikast> ubotu: ok
[12:46] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about ok - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[12:46] <JimQode> Seeker`, sorry I had join/parts disabled
[12:46] <Lustblader> Extravert: so that's the source of the problem
[12:46] <mefiXe> my x-server ist damn slow!
[12:46] <Cochise> mechdave: cheers, its a new probelm thats happened with gutsy, loads on the forums have the same probelm a lanchpad bug was filled ircc
[12:46] <wimdows> compwiz18, I'm stumped
[12:47] <Lustblader> Extravert: not a software issue
[12:47] <Extravert> Lustblader: in 7.04 it detected now after upgrade its not working
[12:47] <JimQode> mefiXe, try disabling desktop effects
[12:47] <askand> Can I have one 512 mb and one 1024 mb ram iin my laptop??
[12:47] <mefiXe> im running kubuntu!
[12:47] <compwiz18> wimdows, me too, I think a nice fresh reinstall is headed my way
[12:47] <mechdave> Cochise: No worries, sorry I couldn't solve it for you :(
[12:47] <zilchy> oling, based on what it says in terminal when I run mixxx and try to select an alsa device, it's a portaudio issue. (just saw that now. :-P)
[12:47] <zhanx> askand, can you afford it?
[12:47] <Cochise> mechdave: thanx for trying
[12:47] <mefiXe> why isnt compiz working, my card is fast enough!
[12:47] <IntuitiveNipple> alien18: note - when configuring with ./configure the default location for installation is set to /usr/local/bin. If you want your built apps to be installed to the standard location on the system use ./configure prefix=/usr
[12:47] <JimQode> askand, it depends both on your laptop and the type of rams you have
[12:47] <Lustblader> Extravert: try searching various devices manually in sound prefs
[12:47] <jxxt> mefiXe, there might be but I doubt that they are fully functional
[12:48] <JimQode> mefiXe, maybe you need a restricted driver?
[12:48] <wimdows> compwiz18, aye - it's a pain, but it will likely sort it; just very annoying not to figure out what the cause was...
[12:48] <mefiXe> i've got the restricted driver running

[12:48] <compwiz18> and pidgin

[12:49] <IntuitiveNipple> compwiz18: I didn't see your original problem, but following the development updates shouldn't be an issue. I've done that since June
[12:49] <Lustblader> Extravert: that's stuff too dangerous for me to give advice bout

[12:49] <elliotjhug> mefiXe: its a bit of a risk and is never recommended.

[12:49] <mechdave> Cochise: Should work...
[12:49] <compwiz18> IntuitiveNipple, it's quite possible there is another source for this bug, but I'm stumped so that's what's next up on the agenda

[12:54] <jscinoz_> lustblader, i fail to see how the HDD would cause the graphics to scramble randomly, i would have thought its gpu/cpu/lcd related
[12:54] <Lustblader> jscinoz_: hd can cause everything to freeze
[12:54] <niekie> aata: if it does, Ubuntu Gutsy should have quite good support for Bluetooth, and you can download some mobile tools through Synaptic.

[12:55] <dystopianray> remus: edubuntu
[12:55] <Lustblader> jscinoz_: unlikely.. agreed.. but looks like a hardware issue.. not at all a software issue
[12:55] <Cochise> mechdave: ill try be back in 5
[12:55] <tomysd_> i installed sudo apt-get install portmapper
[12:55] <elliotjhug> janerik: Sorry, I can't see anything that's wrong there... I mean direct rendering should have any effect upon your speed without desktop effects anyway. You seem to be using the correct driver. Sorry I can't be of any more help. Might be worth asking in the forums?
[12:56] <IntuitiveNipple> compwiz18: Is it a PS/2 keyboard, or USB ?
[12:56] <elliotjhug> janerik: *shouldn't
[12:56] <jscinoz_> Lustblader, but what could it be, as i said the GPU and mobo were replaced less than a week ago, so it cant be these two

[13:50] <Saied> NotSure: i'm using KDE but this is configurable maybe by using gconf-editor. did you search ubuntuforums?
[13:50] <saloxin_> NoWhereMan: not nice. strace -p pid?
[13:50] <Tigerman> void^, my mobo was made in the year 2001
[13:50] <NoWhereMan> saloxin_, nice idea
[13:50] <Tigerman> void^, so why is ACPI disabled by default... you said pre-2000 ACPIs are disabled by default
[13:50] <NoWhereMan> let me see
[13:50] <Ximal> would someone tell me what might cause a program to make ubuntu freeze to a near halt ?
[13:50] <Tigerman> void^, my mobo was made in the year 2001
[13:50] <Tigerman> void^, so why is ACPI disabled by default... you said pre-2000 ACPIs are disabled by default
[13:50] <mechdave> Cochise: What happens if you roll back the driver for the ethernet adapter in windows?
[13:51] <Tigerman> void^, my mobo was made in the year 2001
[13:51] <void^> Tigerman: i also said your bios does not specify the year correctly. and if it's made in 2001 it's probably older software anyways. just try acpi=force and add it to your menu.lst if it works fine. and repeat less.
[13:51] <Ubuntu-newb> Where can I change the background color that appears right after I login and before the desktop shows up... the background color of the splash Image I mean... Anyone know?
[13:51] <Tigerman> void^, i have already tried to add the acpi=force to menu.lst   but the message after rebooting was present again   WTF??!!
[13:51] <bullgard4> [Feisty] English help wanted: Gnome Main Menu System > Administration > Network Analysis opens the program 'Network Tools 2.18.0'. What are the English names of the 8 tabs from left to right?
[13:52] <void^> Tigerman: pastebin your menu.lst
[13:52] <kantor> it is possible to make a expert insstall with ubuntu (like with debian) ?
[13:52] <dooglus> which package can slow the CPU when it gets too hot?
[13:52] <Cochise> mechdave: im going to try plug the pc out and boot straight to linux, this is the power on lan thing i was saying eariler, xp puts the lan to sleep during shutdown and linux cant wake it, but i disabled wake on lan totally from windows and it made no change
[13:52] <extrakick> sup everyone
[13:52] <Cochise> mechdave: brb gonna try plugging out
[13:52] <NotSure> Saied: I have invested a considerable bulk of my time into this issue. I have been googling for a while but to no avail. gconf-editor apparantly does not contain the necessary options. I am certain however that my request may be fulfilled as everything is open source. Again, I beg for the help of open source community.
[13:52] <mechdave> Cochise: no worries
[13:52] <mzuveink> what is the command to have gnome redo the font cache?
[13:53] <Tigerman> void^,  i just need to know if i must delete the 'ro quiet splash' thing
[13:53] <void^> Tigerman: no.
[13:53] <Ubuntu-newb> Where can I change the background color that appears right after I login and before the desktop shows up... the background color of the splash Image I mean... Anyone know?

[13:53] <mechdave> Ubuntu-newb: try google splash screen change Ubuntu
[13:54] <Tigerman> do i have to add acpi=force before 'ro quiet splash' thing   or after that??
[13:54] <NoWhereMan> saloxin_, http://pastebin.com/m6f67bbe3
[13:54] <Saied> NotSure: i saw that on my friend laptop yesterday! it didnt seem to be e bug!
[13:54] <Tigerman> void^,  do i have to add acpi=force before 'ro quiet splash' thing   or after that??
[13:54] <NoWhereMan> saloxin_, it's stuck there, on a waitpid
[13:54] <Ubuntu-newb> mechdave I found a splash screen... and the splash thing works... but it looks crappy with the standard bg color
[13:54] <kantor> it is possible to make an expert insstall with ubuntu (like with debian) ?
[13:54] <TigerDuck> Ah, found the solution to my problem ... I am off again. Bye
[13:54] <void^> Tigerman: doesn't matter. depending on which line(s) you add it you may have to run update-grub.
[13:54] <extrakick> i want to fresh install of ubuntu 7.10 over 7.04, how can i just fromat the relevant drives? im and dual booting with win xp
[13:54] <Ubuntu-newb> mechdave the standard color is this light brown / beige tone... and I want to change that if possible

[13:55] <XsteelWolf> is there any tools that's already come with ubuntu to open iso files?
[13:55] <mzuveink> or rathe how ro manually get ubuntu to re-register all its fonts
[13:55] <Ubuntu-newb> extrakick: I think the CD offers that possibility... you can even transfer some settings and then install over 7.04
[13:55] <mechdave> Ubuntu-newb: Ok, there is a config file somewhere that has those settings in it, but I don't know where sorry :(
[13:56] <Fastn> Does anyone know how i can check what soundcard i have trough terminal
[13:56] <XsteelWolf> Fastn lspci
[13:56] <NoWhereMan> saloxin_, I could reboot and try to remove and reinstall xorg, but I fear I will never get the GUI anymore now O_O
[13:56] <Tigerman> void
[13:56] <NotSure> Saied: this feature was apparently designed for help. However, whenever there are certain programs that tend to misbehave. For instance, Krusader will flash the titlebar without apparent justification. Konsole does that as well.

[13:56] <Ubuntu-newb> mechdave is there nothing under Appearance or something where you can change the color... there must be a setting somewhere...?
[13:56] <Tigerman> do i have to change that to true??
[13:56] <extrakick> ubuntu-newb, thanx, but do u know if i can keep my current home folder or should i jut back tht up because it will be deleted in the process?
[13:56] <XsteelWolf> is there any tools that's already come with ubuntu to open iso files?

[13:58] <IlanG> *how do I back up all my evolution data?
[13:58] <NotSure> Saied: no, this is not peculiar to every program. I don't use gnome-terminal, I use Konsole.
[13:58] <Circus-Killer> IlanG, i just think you need to back up everything under the folder .evolution
[13:58] <Niklas_E> is there any way to recover a ubutu messed up (7.10) partition table? (Ubuntu messed up my 2 harddisk tables)
[13:58] <Circus-Killer> but i could be wrong

[14:09] <IntuitiveNipple> alien18: When configure reports those errors for missing libraries, you need to find the related -dev package and install it. Best thing is to use Synaptic and search for the libXXXX-dev package. Sometimes the name isn't obvious though so Google can be a good friend and working out which libXXXX-dev to install

[14:12] <ompaul> !automatix | saloxin (but you know already)
[14:12] <ubotu> saloxin (but you know already): Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.

[14:12] <dystopianray> gutsy uses the conservative cpu frequency scheduler when i am on battery, which forces the frequency up to maximum, how do I make it use ondemand?

[14:16] <richee> Do I have a bad hard disk ?
[14:16] <saloxin> poe: usually kernel panics are kernel/cpu/motherboard/bad hardware issues. what kernel are you on (uname -a)

[14:23] <Tigerman> at booting my computer i get this message:  'ACPI: no DMI BIOS year, acpi=force is required to enable ACPI'       help me to remove it!
[14:23] <kristofer> DaMi3n, there are other options for php as well - that's why it can't autocomplete
[14:23] <opexoc> I have already installed plugin for firefox: "LiveHttpHeaders". But this doesn't appear in mozilla-firefox. Why?
[14:23] <shnastybiznastic> DaMi3n, well, do you get a list when you double tab after 'php'?
[14:24] <murlidhar> DMole: it's downloading on my desktop so i guess rtorrent doesn't support ntfs but i am not so sure
[14:24] <DaMi3n> kristofer, but it doesnt even list options
[14:24] <Tigerman> how can i revert the BIOS year of my mobo?
[14:24] <DaMi3n> shnastybiznastic, nope
[14:24] <bjb1959> I have a minor issue. I have set power management in the gui to off and shut off screensaver but my monitor still shuts down after 30 minutes. any idea which file I need to change to stop that from happening?

[14:25] <alien18> anyone know how much space wxwidgets takes on your hdd? its eaten half a gig so far, and thats just to make the installer...
[14:25] <edaniel> bjb1959 - are there any settings for suspend in your BIOS?
[14:25] <kristofer> alien18, source is always bigger than the binary counterpart
[14:25] <shnastybiznastic> DaMi3n, that's very strange,  I have no idea.

[14:26] <siloko> hey guys - on my gutsy upgrade apt says it couldn't verify 4 gnome components - that sounds bad - anyone got any clues as to why?
[14:26] <bjb1959> edaniel, it doesn't happen when I boot into opensuse just gutsy
[14:26] <mike> after doing a dist upgrade to gutsy the execution of gnome-session doesn't seem to happen properly after logging in through GDM - any ideas why this might be? X seems fine, and sticking gnome-session in ~/.xinitrc and running `startx' manually seems to work just fine (after shutting down gdm)...

[14:27] <FluxTendu> i'm looking for help for my dual screen & 7.10 ... no matter wich resolution i choose on the screens, i have a "virtual desktop for the two screen" bigger than then two screen... so i must move my mouse to see verything... how to correct that?
[14:27] <jepes> poe: have you tried  memtest?
[14:27] <Siropel> anybody know how can I have more than 2 desktops on ubuntu 7.10 ? I need 4 :)
[14:27] <jepes> poe: its the first thing i run before i installed ubuntu
[14:27] <mechdave> Jaymac: give it a go, should work with that, a way to check is to call sudo mount -a from a terminal
[14:28] <Jaymac> ok
[14:28] <Jaymac> back in a while
[14:28] <kristofer> FluxTendu, dual monitor can be setup using System->Administration->Screens and Graphics
[14:28] <saloxin> Siropel: ubuntu has no such restrictions afaik
[14:28] <edaniel> bjb1959 - got me, that was a guess
[14:28] <FluxTendu> kristofer i use that one...
[14:28] <bjb1959> I have a minor issue. I have set power management in the gui to off and shut off screensaver but my monitor still shuts down after 30 minutes. any idea which file I need to change to stop that from happening?
[14:28] <kristofer> FluxTendu, it works well for me, only I can't get my custom resolution.. are you using an intel chip?
[14:28] <DMole> murlidhar: more likely that you had a bad path or rtorrent has to little permissions ; both are fixable.
[14:28] <shnastybiznastic> DaMi3n, ah.  that's a small step on the road to success
[14:28] <kristofer> FluxTendu, if so, you need to use the i810 driver
[14:28] <FluxTendu> nop nvidia
[14:29] <saloxin> bjb1959: check bios settings?
[14:29] <DaMi3n> :)
[14:29] <addicted68098> hi, I was booting ubuntu 7.10 from the live cd and I got several IO read error things, I have used early versions of ubuntu with success, is it the CD thats the problem?
[14:29] <kristofer> XGL is really really slow on my intel 915GM (using the intel driver). any ideas about making faster?
[14:29] <NullNone> What i have to do to play Matroska video files in Ubuntu 7.10?
[14:29] <defishguy> Hello all.  Does anyone have any suggestions for s2ram in Gutsy?  My understanding is that s2ram has been built in to acpi-config in some way.  s2ram is no longer executable from cli and isn't a part of the repo uswsusp package.  I'm trying to fix suspending on an Acer laptop.
[14:29] <mechdave> Cochise: have a look at this --> http://linux.die.net/man/8/route
[14:29] <bjb1959> saloxin, only happens in gutsy, opensuse works fine on same machine
[14:29] <poe> saloxin: jepes: ok my computer just crashed again!
[14:29] <NTAuthority> addicted68098: if it's an error from the cd/dvd drive, it's probably the cd

[14:30] <defishguy> @kristofer:  Turn off as many of the animated (read: wobbly windows) plugins that you can and that will help.
[14:30] <poe> saloxin: nothing, screen freezes, keyboard + mouse doesn't work, caps lock blinking
[14:30] <gigabytes> has anybody ever tried to run ubuntu 7.04 on a mac using parallels desktop?

[14:30] <ziroday> Hi, where can I get the 7.10 official torrent from?
[14:30] <saloxin> poe: true. sucks bigtime
[14:30] <kristofer> defishguy, that's not really the solution man.. prior to gutsy there weren't any issues
[14:30] <gnomefreak> docta try turning off acpi in bios
[14:31] <docta> ok
[14:31] <JohnnyRep> hi
[14:31] <gnomefreak> ziroday, ubuntu.com
[14:31] <Lakrits> Hello everyone. I have a serious problem I'm hoping someone can help me with. 7.10 booted nicely from the CD and the installation seemed to be fine but when I try to boot from it it crashes and reboots the computer after only a few seconds.
[14:31] <defishguy> @kristofer:  were you using compiz-fusion prior to gutsy?
[14:31] <FluxTendu> kristofer do yo use the "extend the defaut screen" option?
[14:31] <tarchy> hello everyone im a wittle noob who only comes to this IRC to leech help and never return until i get another problem
[14:31] <addicted68098> torrent: http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/gutsy/release/dvd/ubuntu-7.10-dvd-i386.iso.torrent
[14:31] <poe> saloxin: maybe i'll just stick to windows ... and i thought the partitioning would solve this problem (i used wubi for 7.04)
[14:31] <tarchy> yes go to windows
[14:32] <gnomefreak> tarchy, we are here to help just let the channel know your issue

[14:32] <umop> tarchy, you are very witty
[14:32] <shnastybiznastic> DaMi3n, I hate to bug out on you like this, but it's about bedtime for me and my software headache.  If you kep having issues, double check tha your apache and php packages are compatable, then check the logs from apache.
[14:32] <Lakrits> Anyone have any idea why it crashes and reboots just a few seconds into the boot?
[14:32] <poe> saloxin: would i be helpful if i send dmesg over? :|
[14:32] <poe> *it
[14:33] <saloxin> poe: why not. pastebin?

[14:33] <nkegles> whats news in 7.10 version???
[14:33] <pretorian> which program is good for ripping dvds?
[14:33] <slvmecha> if i have an intel dual-core mobo/chipset/etc. do i use 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD
[14:33] <slvmecha> it's a 64-bit laptop
=== noflash is now known as testing
[14:33] <slvmecha> or do i use the x86 version
[14:33] <lamego> nkegles, check the web, it is far more usefull for that question
[14:34] <defishguy> @kristrofer:  Didn't mean to offend, I didn't know that about you.  I was taking it easy.
[14:34] <Onyx_> you just gotta love Ubuntu http://img527.imageshack.us/img527/8383/systeminstallinghc3.png ;D
[14:34] <slvmecha> if i install the x86 version can i still get use out of the dual-core processor?
[14:34] <slvmecha> or enhanced use i should say
[14:34] <nkegles> lamego: go: tks
[14:34] <lamego> slvmecha, yes, you can
[14:34] <saloxin> slvmecha: i always found x86_64 flaky and uses i386. but if you feel adventorous :-)
[14:34] <ocicat> Yes, slvmecha, but try the 64 bit version first.
[14:34] <haru_> someone help me  install apache and php on gutsy
[14:34] <ocicat> 7.10 has better 64bit support.
[14:34] <umop> It's worth trying 64bit
[14:35] <gryfie_> dual core is ony 32 bit
[14:35] <Lakrits> Ok, noone has any idea then.
[14:35] <thnee> when i activate proftpd with gproftpd or with /etc/init.d/proftd start it says started and nothing happens, the server is till off.. what is broken?
[14:35] <saloxin> slvmecha: dualcoe = smp support - which is in i386 as well
[14:35] <slvmecha> really gryfie_? ok
[14:35] <gryfie_> or, to be exact, core duo, is 32 bit
[14:35] <mechdave> haru_: apt-get install apache2
[14:35] <Deformation> Anyone can help me please? my laptop fan does not stop since i upgraded to gutsy
[14:35] <gryfie_> core 2 duo may be 64 bit
[14:35] <slvmecha> it's core 2 duo
[14:35] <mechdave> haru_: apt-get install apache-php
[14:35] <Jaymac> mechdave: no luck
[14:35] <slvmecha> well can i run 32 bit apps on it
[14:35] <gryfie_> ok :)
[14:35] <ocicat> Yes.
[14:35] <NotSure> I use XChat in Gnome. I would be grateful is someone could tell me how to scroll up the text beyond what is available.
[14:35] <geoaxis> so when should i move on to gusty
[14:35] <mechdave> Jaymac: Hang on a sec
[14:35] <poe> saloxin: ok done
[14:36] <Deformation> Anyone can help me please? my laptop fan does not stop since i upgraded to gutsy
[14:36] <geoaxis> i have a production dev machine
[14:36] <saloxin> poe: got it
[14:36] <gnomefreak> slyou can install 32 bit arch on a 64bit proc
[14:36] <slvmecha> so i can run 64 bit while still being able to use all the apps that are only 32 bit? ok
[14:36] <Jaymac> Got the following error when I clicked on the drive to mount it:
[14:36] <haru_> mechdave, i have apache2 , php5 and libapache2-mod-php
[14:36] <dooglus> geoaxis: I'd advise against it.  It adds little, and causes lots of problems.
[14:36] <slvmecha> i want to get the most out of this machine, if it's capable of 64-bit i don't see why not
[14:36] <haru_> mechdave, theres no apache-php package
[14:36] <Jaymac> [mntent]: line 16 in /etc/fstab is bad
[14:36] <mechdave> haru_: apt-get install apache2-php
[14:36] <Jaymac> mount: can't find /media/Windows in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[14:36] <haru_> mechdave, doesnt exist either

[14:37] <mechdave> haru_: Sorry, yeah install those
[14:37] <IntuitiveNipple> slvmecha: amd64 is fine on Intel Core 2 Duo, and even better if the CPUs and BIOS allow the hardware VT (kvm-vt)

[14:37] <haru_> mechdave, installed, yet php isnt being parsed
[14:37] <dooglus> geoaxis: maybe a clean install would work OK, but upgrading for feisty has caused me too many problems
[14:37] <dooglus> geoaxis: s/for/from/
[14:37] <edaniel>  My screen goes to black after the Ubuntu loadbar is finished every other time I startup, The OS is running (startup sounds play) but I can't see anything. A Hard restart then works, ans everything is fine.  This happens every other time I startup, which is troubling on a laptop.
[14:37] <slvmecha> what's the ram limit on 32/64 bit ubuntu's
[14:37] <saloxin> poe: why are you booting with acpi=off?
[14:37] <geoaxis> dooglus:  i always do clean install ...upgrades do alot of clutter in any case
[14:38] <ocicat> 32bit uses only 4 GB.
[14:38] <NotSure> I would like to address my issue to ubuntu community support via email. Could somebody please provide me with that email?
[14:38] <geoaxis> (i just rsync my home dir)
[14:38] <IntuitiveNipple> Deformation: check for similar bug reports (against ACPI) in at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ and if you can't find a similar one, create a new one against linux-source-2.6.22
[14:38] <gnychis> after upgrading to gutsy, my keyboard's right alt key no longer works... i used to have the shortcut of alt and + to maximize a window, but now it only works if I use my left alt... any ideas?
[14:38] <poe> saloxin: cos i thought that would solve the problem... i googled and found something like it, but it didn't help
[14:38] <haru_> mechdave, any ideas?
[14:38] <mechdave> haru_: It is an issue with php.ini, perhaps you could try #apache2
[14:38] <slvmecha> IntuitiveNipple: how do i set up kvm-vt?
[14:38] <gnomefreak> NotSure, go to lists.ubuntu.com and join the ubuntu-users mailing list
[14:38] <poe> saloxin: if i remove it there is still the same error
[14:39] <NotSure> gnomefreak: Thank You
[14:39] <saloxin> poe: ok, makes sense.
[14:39] <Deformation> IntuitiveNipple: i think that its powernowd, its not starting
[14:39] <jess> i am updating to gusty gibson and getting a bunch of package dependency errors
[14:40] <IntuitiveNipple> slvmecha: kvm is part of the kernel now... if you have VT hardware then sudo modprobe kvm-intel will load it, then you can use "sudo apt-get install kvm" to install the VT-capable version of QEMU

[14:40] <edaniel> gnychis: did you check the keyboard shortcuts in System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts ?
[14:40] <pretorian> which program is good for ripping dvds?
[14:40] <jess> for example login, passwd, bash, etc are giving me errors from the update
[14:40] <pretorian> btw, it is allowed in my country to "rip" dvds...
[14:40] <jess> is this a problem?
[14:40] <saloxin> poe: try "noapic" in the same place. just a hunch
[14:41] <saloxin> together with acpi=off
[14:41] <IntuitiveNipple> Deformation: That could be it. If you can find similar bug reports add to them as much specific detail about your system as you can, and the dmesg/kern.log and output of lspci -nn and other reports asked for in the Wiki for bug reports
[14:41] <easytiger> gah. why does the gnome power applet not step up my cpu when i plug in the power adaptor. The kde one does.. and has an option to manually increase it. but thegnome one doesn't.. how can i do this?
[14:41] <poe> saloxin: ok thanks, btw i tried it in wubi 7.04 (didn't work) but haven't tried it in 7.10 so maybe it will work here...
[14:41] <gnychis> edaniel: apparently it seems to be seeming with a "third level" on keyboards introduced in to gutsy: http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130923-page,1-c,linux/article.html ... but i don't use gnome to follow these instructions to fix it

[14:45] <poe> saloxin: ok i've added noapic,  i have to reboot for the change to take place right?
[14:45] <saloxin> poe: you might also try linux-image-2.6.22-14-386
[14:45] <Koh_> hi! , how can i cp a folder and keep his symbolic links ?
[14:45] <NotSure> I apologize but my early request was not properly formulated. Could somebody provide me with an email for gnome bug support?
[14:45] <saloxin> poe: yep. kernel commandlines are only read at boot
[14:45] <slvmecha> gutsy is 7.10?
[14:45] <edaniel> My screen goes to black after the Ubuntu loadbar is finished every other time I startup, The OS is running (startup sounds play) but I can't see anything. A Hard restart then works, ans everything is fine.  This happens every other time I startup, which is troubling on a laptop.
[14:46] <fant> slvmecha: yes
[14:46] <saloxin> Koh_: man rsync - see the -l option
[14:46] <Koh_> saloxin: thank i'll try
[14:46] <easytiger> edaniel: what happens if you go to a virtual terminal? sounds like you x is going out of sync range
[14:46] <saloxin> Koh_: hm man cp also mentions -d. check it out
[14:47] <justin420> anybody tell me how to configure the compiz-fusion for gutsy?
[14:47] <poe> saloxin: what's the difference between that and the ubuntu i'm using?
[14:47] <Jaymac> mechdave, deleted that line from /etc/fstab as it won't let me manually mount the windows partition now either
[14:47] <easytiger> justin420: sudo aptitude install compizconfig-settings-manager
[14:47] <bullgard4> English help wanted: Gnome Main Menu System > Administration > Network Analysis opens the window 'Network Tools'. What are the English names of the 8 tabs from left to right?
[14:47] <saloxin> poe: its a slightly differently configured kernel (same ubuntu)
=== co_band_drummer is now known as Master_RO
[14:48] <Cochise> justin420 - open terminal and type sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[14:48] <poe> saloxin: oh
[14:48] <saloxin> poe: it comes without smp support (which you don't need), and isn't optimized for pentiium M. speed differences souldn't be noticable though
[14:48] <edaniel> easytiger: The screen is black, I don't know if the terminal is launching or not
[14:48] <mechdave> Cochise: route add -net 89.101.234  netmask 255.255.254.0 dev eth0
[14:48] <easytiger> edaniel: Ctrl-Alt-F1 or F2 etc will take you to a virtual terminal
[14:48] <poe> saloxin: doesn't smp helps in a  network with windows?
[14:48] <saloxin> poe: trick is to find something that works, and then compare :-D
[14:49] <mechdave> Cochise: route add default gw 89.101.66.1
[14:49] <fant> edaniel:  go to shell2 (ctrl-alt-f2) ... login there and do a dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[14:49] <mechdave> Cochise: that should work!
[14:49] <justin420> i dont suppose there is any other way? i cant get a connection to us.archive.ubuntu.com, it appears to just timeout.
[14:49] <saloxin> poe: smp = symmetric multi processing - for dualcore or multi cpu's
[14:49] <Cochise> mechdave should i remove the old entry first?
[14:49] <mechdave> Jaymac: what error does mount give you?
[14:49] <mrmaple> Hello.... I'm having trouble with an install...
[14:49] <easytiger> justin420: well fix that first
[14:49] <poe> saloxin: oic, thanks
[14:49] <mechdave> Cochise: yep
[14:49] <easytiger> its a good bet your resolution/sync range is too high
[14:49] <fant> since my upgrade to 710 my nm-applet no longer displays.  Also when i run it from the terminal i am getting dbus errors.  Can anyone help ?
[14:49] <edaniel> Thanks, easytiger and fant, I'll try that
[14:49] <poe> saloxin: so i uninstall this ubuntu and install the i386 one?
[14:50] <mrmaple> The install from CD goes fine, but on reboot I can't boot anything from the hard drive.
[14:50] <Jaymac> mount: can't find /media/Windows in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
[14:50] <edaniel> brb
[14:50] <saloxin> poe: nono
[14:50] <kaminix> What does the command nice do? "Run COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process scheduling."?
[14:50] <Cochise> mechdave the delete command you gave me eariler wont work
[14:50] <sc0tch> I'm trying to find out if gutsy is using my swap partition, i can't tell, 'dmesg | grep swap' showed nothing. the swap parition got created/found during install, but can't tell if the system is using it, can anyone give me some pointers?
[14:50] <easytiger> kaminix: modifies the scheduling of an application
[14:50] <easytiger> ie. give a process more cput time than the other
[14:50] <saloxin> poe: you click on "add removeprograms" and select a new kernel linux-image-2.6.22-14-386
[14:50] <justin420> easytiger: the only thing i think that will fix that is time now; unless you can connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com? then i know its just my p.o.s
[14:50] <mrmaple> Could someone help me check my grub?
[14:50] <LjL> kaminix: lower number = higher priority
[14:51] <flick> hi i have an NTFS drive which is sometimes running very slow in windows but running normally in ubuntu
[14:51] <kaminix> easytiger: I see... when do I want to use that?
[14:51] <saloxin> sc0tch: cat /proc/swaps
[14:51] <flick> can i copy the ubuntu hard disk drivers to windows so that it runs faster?
[14:51] <user_> wireless seems to suck in gutsy
[14:51] <saloxin> sc0tch: top and free should tell you too
[14:51] <mechdave> Jaymac: sudo mkdir /media/Windows
[14:51] <easytiger> kaminix: pob never.. if you have a specific process you want to say run only when the system is idle maybe
[14:51] <pipatron> So hm, what's the recomended way to configure Compiz in ubuntu gutsy? I installed some CompizConfig Settings Manager but it's damn buggy
[14:51] <easytiger> justin420: i can ping it fine
[14:51] <Jaymac> mechdave, did that
[14:51] <easytiger> pipatron: see above
[14:51] <Jaymac> then rebooted... and had no luck

[14:52] <mechdave> Jaymac: mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt

[14:52] <Cochise> mechdave no prob ill stay logged in but im going to fly for a cigeratte b back in a sec ill let ya know when im back
[14:52] <saloxin> bullgard4: disable non-ubuntu sources in administration-software sources
[14:52] <easytiger> justin420: ireland
[14:52] <sc0tch> saloxin: thanks, cat /proc swaps returned a file: /dev/sdb3 ...type, etc... so that looks ok, just was confused about the lack of dmesg output
[14:52] <fant> since my upgrade to 710 my nm-applet no longer displays.  Also when i run it from the terminal i am getting dbus errors.  Can anyone help ?
[14:52] <mechdave> Jaymac: does that work?

[14:54] <bullgard4> saloxin: What are 'administration-software sources', please?

[15:28] <ProN00b> what does ubuntu do when i don't set up a swap partition, will it use a swap file ? and if yes, where is that file ?
[15:28] <eiaway> saloxin: there's no way to just start the process without having to burn a CD? Because I think I would have to change first my hardware, download CD burner etc etc

[15:28] <tyreej> no there isnt eiaway

[15:31] <poe> saloxin: is there anyway i can accelerate the download of apt-get? it's rather slow :P
[15:31] <LjL> poe: use mirrors closer to you
[15:31] <kemean> Can who tell me how to patch david subpix patch for UBUNTU 7.10?
[15:31] <chippy> poe, wait until everyone has upgraded their systems to gusty
[15:32] <poe> chippy: ok
[15:32] <chippy> a week and the traffic would be better
[15:32] <tappi> is it gutsy or gusty?
[15:32] <Cochise> mechdave: talking to you here from ubuntu
[15:32] <saloxin> poe: choose a different mirror is your only option. most are swamped after gutsy release
[15:32] <eiaway> saloxin: would it work fine if i install 6.06 and then update? or is upgrading tricky?
[15:32] <chippy> :) gusty sounds nice
[15:32] <LjL> tappi: type /topic
[15:32] <kane77> wolferine, at the beginning I was only going for one (/), but soon I found out that that's not too good (in case like reinstalling I have to back up /home.. and then there were couple of things I needed on separate.. so now I have /, /home, /tmp, /boot, /var/lib/mysql and /var/www :)
[15:32] <tappi> gusty sounds more awesome :P
[15:33] <saloxin> eiaway: should work fine - although will take time. you have to go through all the interrim releases
[15:33] <eyedol>  I always get confused when spelling it tappi

[15:33] <poe> saloxin: how do i choose a different mirror? apt-get auto chooses for me :|
[15:33] <mechdave> Cochise: well here it is, something funny going on with it there!
[15:33] <LjL> poe: edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[15:33] <eiaway> saloxin: will it do that automaticly? or do I have to do like 10 upgrades manually? :)
[15:33] <angelo> e
[15:33] <shwouchk> LjL: no - the bug there is for charachrers repeating, wheres on my end ALL characters are printed as caps.

[15:33] <seiflotfy> hi guys
[15:33] <keo92> Why does VirtualBox have a ugly GUI ????
[15:34] <seiflotfy> any1 got online desktop on gutsy ?
[15:34] <Cochise> mechdave: i take it, its a dhcp issue so
[15:34] <jamesfoster> poe: System -> Administration -> Software Sources
[15:34] <LjL> shwouchk: but you also said your cursor keys make the cursor "jump around", which sounded like the system thinks they're kept pressed
[15:34] <saloxin> eiaway: ~ 4 upgrades manually. with a lot of annoyng questions and posibilities for failure
[15:34] <LjL> keo92: it's open source, make a better one.
[15:34] <wwwjek> hi
[15:35] <kane77> there is a bug in pidgin - it doesn't remember which plugins I want... how can I fix it?
[15:35] <eiaway> ah, 4 is doable
[15:35] <shwouchk> LjL: yes but they don't jump around in the same sense - they jump to a weird location and my screen becomes partly garbled
[15:35] <keo92> LjL : Yes, thank but i know... i'm not stupid
[15:35] <wolferine> kane77, can you pm me your estimated sizes for each ?
[15:35] <davis_> anyone can help me with video issue on gutsy?

[15:35] <wwwjek> hi

[15:41] <poningru> muszek_: just extrapolate from subnet and your current IP
[15:41] <LjL> keo92: i suspect that GTK might be compiled statically in virtualbox, since "ldd /usr/bin/virtualbox" says "not a dynamic executable"
[15:41] <keo92> LjL : Do you know what i mean when i'm talking about the interface ? It looks like a old interface...
[15:41] <mvashi> d90 go to ubuntu.com and u will get all the details
[15:41] <saloxin> poe: you can look around for a faster mirror in software sources. anything non-default will help
[15:41] <LjL> keo92: yes, i got it
[15:41] <albech> poningru: i think he want the outside ip of the router he is going through
[15:41] <fant> Does anyone know how to get nm-applet to start.  Even running from shell produces no errors and nothing happens.
[15:41] <vehicle> "you must manually run dpkg --configure -a to correct the problem"  (i cant get the update to run)
[15:41] <vehicle> i type that in and apparently i need to be a 'superuser'   I don't think I will ever be a superuser, but does anyone know how i can convince my computer that i am???
[15:41] <poningru> muszek_: oh...
[15:41] <keo92> LjL : well, so is there a solution Doc' ?
[15:41] <mortal1> when it says something is downloading at KB/sec, is that kiloBYTES or kiloBITS
[15:42] <poe> saloxin: ok sure. i'll go do something else now while waiting
[15:42] <poningru> just go to whatsmyip.com
[15:42] <shwouchk> LjL: lol, how aweful... I'll try though, thanks
[15:42] <tyreej> vehicle, sudo will convince it
[15:42] <astro76> !sudo | vehicle
[15:42] <muszek_> albech: yes, poningru: there's no IP address in interfaces; how do I extrapolate from IP and subnet?  it's 192.168.1.1 and 255.255.255.0
[15:42] <ubotu> vehicle: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[15:42] <saloxin> vehicle: sudo  dpkg --configure -a
[15:42] <mvashi> i wonder what happened ... my qbittorrent wont work after upgrading to 7.10
[15:42] <d90> XsteelWolf	, doesnt work
[15:42] <albech> muszek_: if that is the case its easy to go to a webpage that will show your ip number.. that will be the outside of your gateway

[15:43] <poningru> just type in route in a command line
[15:43] <jrib> keo92: can you post a screenshot?
[15:43] <muszek_> poningru: ping 192.168.1.0      -> Do you want to ping broadcast? Then -b

[15:43] <swill> Albin:  are you using wireless or are you using a ethernet connection?
[15:43] <saloxin> pitfall: software sucks as a rule
[15:43] <poningru> muszek_: yep thats your gateway
[15:43] <keo92> jrib, of course. Wait a minute
[15:43] <foo21> Cochise: it didnt work, when i put it to dhcp the connection-information dont show up at all, but the netwok-manager doesent report any problem...
[15:43] <albech> muszek_: you can also do a traceroute and see which IPs it pass right after it leave the internal ones
[15:43] <fant> I wonder how many of us wish we would have applied the MS mentality to the 710 upgrade and not switched until at least a month after release
[15:43] <poningru> use ping -b 192.168.1.0
[15:43] <swill> Albin: how are you on here if the internet is not working?  (different computer?)
[15:44] <muszek_> albech: thanks, I'll try that

[15:45] <poningru> fant: whats the issues?
[15:45] <muszek_> albech, poningru: traceroute gave me what I need.  thanks for your help.
[15:45] <poningru> Joanki: then change it
[15:45] <alchu> saloxin: so i just have to wait?
[15:45] <fant> right now if i could just get nm-applet to work i would be pacified enough to deal with the other issues

[15:46] <poningru> fant: hmm that is weird what doesnt work?

[15:47] <hfitch> hello
[15:47] <Bakefy> thanks mortal1, what is the command I use to edit... I know its something different than gedit.
[15:47] <AndyBesy> Hey, anyone help with a problem mounting LVM partitions after upgrade to Gusty please? thanks!
[15:47] <Blou_Aap>                                                is there port forwarding utils in ubuntu ?  how wuold i go on and forward 6112 on both udp and tcp
[15:47] <mvashi> i wonder what happened ... my qbittorrent wont work after upgrading to 7.10
[15:47] <annabelle> muszek : sorry
[15:47] <yuxingguo> my updown speed is very snow
[15:47] <poningru> Joanki: google that name
[15:47] <Moduliz0r> Whats the MD5 sum for ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso ?
[15:47] <poningru> I dont know the exact url
[15:47] <muszek_> annabelle: let's try it differently: System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
[15:47] <Joanki> k
[15:47] <fant> poningru:  yeah makes me configure my network connections manually every time i switch, which is about as annoying as explaining to a 10 year old how to use vista
[15:47] <flick> how do i add custom entries in the application menus?
[15:47] <swill> albin: did you get my pm?
[15:47] <mortal1> Bakefy, try nano
[15:47] <hfitch> does anyone else have nvidia 8800gts that seems not to want any drivers
[15:47] <Albin> yes
[15:47] <mortal1> nice and simple
[15:47] <erUSUL> flick: right click and choose edit
[15:48] <annabelle>  muszek :i dont have that packager thing
[15:48] <Albin> but i don't know how to answer only to you
[15:48] <poningru> fant: do you have roaming enabled for each interface?
[15:48] <swill> albin: just making sure that pidgin is working...  ;)
[15:48] <Albin> ?
[15:48] <Bakefy> mortal1, you are a great help.
[15:48] <wirechief> !md5sum
[15:48] <fant> poningru:  yes
[15:48] <ubotu> To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM for more
[15:48] <annabelle> :| what should i do?
[15:48] <muszek_> annabelle: tip #2: use tab completion... you typed in "muszek" instead of "muszek_" and it wasn't colored for me... when you press TAB in the middle of typing my nick, it should auto-complete the rest
[15:48] <mortal1> Bakefy, anytime man
[15:48] <flick> erUSUL, wow thanks... i think i'll take some time to get used to this new level of intuitive interface!
[15:48] <Sir_HaL> help, please: I need wireless to startup before I login. using 7.10 on a desktop pc. easy [gui] way to do this?

[15:49] <muszek_> annabelle: I guess that means you don't have admin priviledges on this computer...
[15:49] <suupaabaka> is there a way to get the x11 video driver running fullscreen with mplayer?

[15:54] <Kedlun> Hi
[15:54] <poningru> odemata: what you have to do is tell grub during install to look for two hard disks
[15:54] <webpirate> I have not done anything since 6.10...just let the upgrader do everything....that why I love ubuntu
[15:54] <cafuego> lgc__: dunno?

[15:55] <lgc__> cafuego, thanks anyway. I'll keep asking.
[15:55] <jim> nkegles, what program would that be?

[16:03] <Joanki> once i download a new desktop theme, does anyone know how to install it?
[16:03] <Jaggs> I guess I am really needing someone else who has made a Broadcom 1390 card work for them... to help me work the kinks in mine.
[16:03] <webpirate> if you go by that the restrictred drivers might not work for him either
[16:03] <Joanki> i'm new to linux... i know that must be a very basic question
[16:03] <webpirate> everything might not work so why try anything?
[16:03] <dthacker-lt> so with all the dire warnings against envy and automatix, where do I get codecs to play DVD's?  The wiki page is out of date.
[16:04] <poningru> Joanki: just drag and drop it onto the theme window

[16:08] <astro76> !root | Secret_Hamster
[16:08] <ubotu> Secret_Hamster: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth.. there is no root password. Then you will see that it is sudo that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo

[16:09] <astro76> Sir_HaL, do not advise to set root password, 99.99% of the time it is not necessary
[16:09] <andrew_> i have a laptop and external monitor
[16:09] <yellow> laggs: thank you
[16:09] <saloxin> astro76: what do you do when booting requires fsck?
[16:09] <luigi> Is there someone that is like a bash script that autenticate in a site page write in php?
[16:09] <Secret_Hamster> that's it. Why don't they just put that on the website. From what they keep saying it sounds like they hacked around to provide the security

[16:33] <tim167> hello, can an old 500mHz computer run ubuntu ?
[16:33] <jdod> so the grub file is on my xp drive?
[16:33] <mikeo2> do-release-upgrade froze at removing old packages, how do i tell if it finished or not?
[16:33] <dipu> Hi there I have a SONY VAIO laptop with MOTION EYE webcam.. however my ubuntu 7.10 does not detect it ... how can i get it working ???
[16:34] <jdod> or part of it?
[16:34] <nikolhs> nothing seems to work when i try to install it
[16:34] <AaronMT> Hi, I have an ATI card with 7.0 in a laptop and I can not suspend/hibernate/resume without it crashing to a black screen. I believe SLUB exposes a bug in fglrx that manifests itself as a failure over suspend/resume. How can I fix this?
[16:34] <kwunman> Is anyone else here having problems with installing firefox extensions in gusty the old fashioned way, i.e. from the add on website?
[16:34] <cox377> lnknpk04: whats up?
[16:34] <Puppy_> ok.
[16:34] <Puppy_> Thanks!
[16:34] <jdod> or part of it is?
[16:34] <nikolhs> i tried skype for linux,not working
[16:34] <metfan2007> Hi all!!! I just installed Ubuntu 7.10 in my Dell Precision M20 Laptop, everything works great, except for the boot spalsh screen. When I start up my laptop I don't see anything until it shows the login screen... any idea?
[16:34] <cox377> tim167: any 86x can
[16:34] <mauri_> LjL: yes yes now it's works...thanks agin
[16:34] <luite> lnknpk04: hm, I'd still guess there is something wrong with the module build setup, it should be able to find config.h
[16:34] <lnknpk04> cox377, ENLWI-G2 wireless card.  trying to compile the linux drivers from vendor, getting errors. http://pastebin.com/d16894650
[16:34] <stefg> jdod, the actaul boot loader is in the MBR of your XP-Drive, but it references /boot/grub/menu.lst on your ubuntu-drive
[16:34] <saloxin> metfan2007: remove splash and quiet from /boot/grub/menu.lst
[16:35] <tim167> cox377 workably ? , i mean any idea how slow will it be ?
[16:35] <metfan2007> saloxin, ok, I'll try... thanks
[16:35] <astro76> tim167, do you plan to use it as a desktop? how much memory? with something that slow you probably want to try xubuntu (xfce)
[16:35] <boubbin> usser then follows a information of few packages, and above is told that  the info could be useful when reporting the problem, then info listed below is: These packages have unsolvede depencies; libxine1-plugins: depency:. libxine1-gnome (but not marked for installation) libxine1-kde  (but not marked for installation libxine1-console  (but not marked for installation
[16:35] <lnknpk04> luite, i'm a novice at building stuff myself.  where is it running into issues?
[16:35] <stefg> jdod, do have an option in the Bios to select the device to boot from first?
[16:35] <fredl> if you want your fanspeed controlled by Linux, should you enable ACPI in the BIOS or not?
[16:35] <cox377> tim167: I've run it on plenty of 500's, just turn off some of the fancy graphics - actually i used 7.04 but i don't think there is much difference
[16:35] <jdod> yes
[16:35] <tim167> astro76, it would be for a very minimal installation, maybe with fluxbox...
[16:35] <GuStGiBB> hi does anyone have problems regarding Gusty 7.10???
[16:36] <lnknpk04> luite, is it all when dealing with my headers?
[16:36] <zerodamage> Hi.  Are the video-in / Capture capabilities of the All In Wonder supported such as the 7500 AIW?
[16:36] <astro76> tim167, that would be good, gnome and kde would definitely be very slow
[16:36] <techknow___> ebirtaid, you still there?
[16:36] <techknow___> sorry
[16:36] <techknow___> my net connection died
[16:36] <tim167> co377, ok cool, how much should i pay for suc a machine ? is €30,00 reasonable ?
[16:36] <saloxin> fredl: enable acpi if you can
[16:36] <jdod> stefg: yes i do
[16:36] <tim167> cox377 ^ *such
[16:36] <cox377> tim167: alternatively you could using xubuntu for lighters
[16:36] <fredl> jdod - I've installed the lm-sensors package, I am 100% sure that my BIOS can control the fan speed but under 7.10 the fans seem to be running too fast
[16:37] <lnknpk04> nikolhs, how are you installing?  through synaptic, deb files, or tarbals
[16:37] <zerodamage> anyone?
[16:37] <cox377> tim167: lol for a 500mhz machine
[16:37] <scriptha> I changed something in my /usr/lib file to get some codecs working, and now no program can start anymore. How do I check what I've done wrong and how do I fix it?
[16:37] <Balaams_Miracle> f0rgeIf`: Why do you tell me that?
[16:37] <fredl> jdod,saloxin - also, the 'sensors' readings appear to be nonsense, my CPU is freezing.
[16:37] <luite> lnknpk04: I think there are 2 problemes, the errors with the INIT_WORK macro seem to indicate that this version is for another kernel. the other config.h include error (file not found, line 102) indicates that it's not correctly set up
[16:37] <stefg> jdod, so you have to write grub's mbr part to the second (ubuntu) disk, and restore the XP-bootloader to the first disk. then let your BIOS look for the second disk first. If it's present it will boot grub, if it's disconnected the XP bootloader will be seen
[16:37] <nanbudh> would the 7.10 live cd have gparted on it?
[16:37] <zerodamage> nanbudh, yes

[16:37] <astro76> !ask | GuStGiBB
[16:37] <ubotu> GuStGiBB: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[16:38] <nanbudh> thanks
[16:38] <pipatron> GuStGiBB: Probably not
[16:38] <zerodamage> I have a simple question that hasn't been answered after 2 tries
[16:38] <metfan2007> saloxin, Thanks! now it shows the usplash!!!
[16:38] <minus> How do I get my extra harddrives to automount so that I don't have to go to "Computer" and press mount?
[16:38] <Ditters> Hi people. what do i need to do in order to c-o-m-p-l-e-t-e-l-y reinstall EVOLUTION?
[16:38] <saloxin> metfan2007: :-D
[16:38] <jdod> stefg: soif i just do a complete from scratch reinstall of everything what i need to do in the first place to avoid this?
[16:38] <GuStGiBB> well my computer freezes... does it have to do w/desktop effects??
[16:38] <fredl> zerodamage - I have the same problem here most of the time :) anyway, go ahead and ask your question again, I'll see if I can help you.
[16:38] <astro76> Ditters, why do you need to do that?
[16:38] <techknow___> ebirtaid, any ideas?
[16:38] <stefg> jdod, you'll end up with the same result
[16:38] <Daedalus_Prime> Hey, I have a rather important networking issue that I am sure some of you may be aware about, and I would like to know how to fix it. Can anyone tell me how to get my Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter working properly?
[16:38] <tim__b> some little problem i have with gutsy: my screen got darkend after 10 minutes of inactivity although i deactivated that feature in gnome-power-manager (in both profiles, accumulator and wired). DPMS is also deactivated in xorg.conf. (please highlight my nickname on answer, thanks)
[16:38] <xjkx> Ditters, it depends on how you installed
[16:38] <lnknpk04> luite, ok.  I'm gonna call the manufacturer on this since they provide the driver.  though I doubt I'll get any support.
[16:39] <minus> Ditters, sudo apt-get --purge remove evolution && sudo apt-get install evolution
[16:39] <jdod> lol that kinda sucks
[16:39] <edubuntu> Hola's anyone here able to tell me how to pint grub at new config file?   this laptoop blowz and has only256 MB Ram and will not hardly even run KDE, But i tried to install kUbuntu and I cant handle the lagginess till i gets me some more ram in laptop

[16:39] <poe> saloxin: hi i'm back again booting from i386... is there anything i can check now or do i just wait for a freeze?
[16:39] <edubuntu> I would like to delet partition but dont wanna mess up grub
[16:39] <lnknpk04> luite, thanks for looking at it with me.
[16:39] <jerryb> Can I go directly from Edgy to Gutsy by changing the repo list b4 launching the update manager?
[16:39] <GuStGiBB> i mean it runs fine... top speed... but it suddenly freezes...
[16:39] <hendrixski> ceed, if you shh through command line, just use apt-get remove
[16:39] <edubuntu> I want it pointin back to the grub conf on this partition
[16:39] <fredl> ceed - use apt-get remove or dpkg --purge
[16:39] <zerodamage> Can anyone tell me if the ATI 7500 AIW cards video input are supported in any way?
[16:39] <saloxin> poe: just wait :-=
[16:39] <stefg> jdod, reinstalling is no cure for that. you need to understand what is what with the bootloader
[16:39] <poe> saloxin: ok
[16:39] <fredl> zerodamage - that's your 'simple' question?
[16:39] <Ditters> minus: thanks
[16:40] <DASPRiD|lazy> Hm, how to install ACPID from the source packages?
[16:40] <hendrixski> zerodamage, I'm having problems with the ATI 7500 as well
[16:40] <astro76> Ditters, keep in mind apt-get --purge won't delete your user data and settings in ~/.evolution
[16:40] <Daedalus_Prime> Hey, I have a rather important networking issue that I am sure some of you may be aware about, and I would like to know how to fix it. Can anyone tell me how to get my Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter working properly?
[16:40] <ceed> hendrixski: thanks

[16:40] <techknow___> anyone able to help me with this http://stikked.hippstr.com/index.php/view/1c9954f7
[16:40] <hendrixski> zerodamage, it seems to be feeding off the the CPU instead of the card
[16:40] <cox377> Daedalus_Prime: whats up with it?
[16:40] <minus> How do I get my extra harddrives to automount so that I don't have to go to "Computer" and press mount?
[16:40] <techknow___> before you give me the usual sound thing

[16:41] <brooklynhype> anyone recomend a bittorrent client?
[16:41] <techknow___> but it doesn't work
[16:41] <hendrixski> ceed, you're welcome.  there's a man page about apt-get too if you need more info while in the command line
[16:41] <minus> brooklynhype, uTorrent under wine
[16:41] <Lord_Illidan> brooklynhype, deluge works nice
[16:41] <fredl> brooklynhype, I like torrentflux
[16:41] <astro76> Ditters, ok I just wasn't sure what the problem was you were trying to solve
[16:41] <cox377> brooklynhype: azureus?
[16:41] <Ditters> astro76: I'll try to load it later
[16:41] <jdod> deluge works ok for me
[16:41] <saxin> Looking for a nice bittorent client. Suggestions?
[16:41] <minus> uTorrent
[16:41] <usser> boubbin: looks like u have dependencies problem, u're running gutsy right?
[16:41] <luite> lnknpk04: the INIT_WORK macro ( include/linux/workqueue.h ) has changed between kernel 2.6.18 and 2.6.20, so you should get an updated version of the driver for gutsy
[16:41] <Lord_Illidan> bittorrent - deluge imho
[16:41] <mlaci> hi guys! i've just started to use the official nvidia ubuntu modules instead of the nvidia provided insallation script and i get api mismatch. how should i resolve this problem?
[16:41] <usser> boubbin: try sudo apt-get update
[16:41] <hendrixski> saxin, there's on that comes pre-installed with Ubuntu
[16:41] <minus> uTorrent under wine is <3
[16:41] <fredl> torrentflux can run on my server :)
[16:41] <xjkx> fredl, has it something to  do with fluxbox project?
[16:41] <saxin> hendrixski: I want a better one
[16:41] <saxin> uTorrent is nice.. but not for linux?
[16:41] <pipatron> Don't use a new version of uTorrent though
[16:42] <saxin> why not?
[16:42] <fredl> xjkx - nope. torrentflux is a web application.
[16:42] <Ditters> astro76: the problem is that this backup folder was created on 7.10, and now II'm using 7.04
[16:42] <cox377> fredl: torrentflux is sweet : )
[16:42] <boubbin> usser gutsy (kubuntu)
[16:42] <zerodamage> hendrixski:  the 3d abilities of the card are fine.  compiz-fusion worked out of the box on 7.10.  But using the card for mythtv is my concern.  I am not finding anything on the forums at all.
[16:42] <lnknpk04> luite, ok.
[16:42] <pipatron> saxin: They send unidentified packages back to the new owner
[16:42] <stefg> jdod, no it won't remove the grub *config* but only the MBR-part (which is perfect , because it was on the wrong disk anyway). The you have to boot up ubunt from Live CD and do a grub install to (hd1) instead of (hd0)...
[16:42] <brooklynhype> anyone use ktoren ?
[16:42] <astro76> Ditters, oh yeah right ;) you never said why you went back to 7.04
[16:42] <pipatron> saxin: The latest 'safe' version is some 1.6
[16:42] <stefg> !grub | jdod

[16:43] <hendrixski> zerodamage, wow.  mine didn't do the desktop effects.  I'm on the mobility radeon 7500 though, I dunno if that's a different one than yours.   And Mythtv worked perfectly fine on here in feisty
[16:43] <Ditters> astro76: I can't run 1024X768 on 7.10. only less then that
[16:43] <minus> How do I get my extra harddrives to automount so that I don't have to go to "Computer" and press mount?
[16:43] <usser> boubbin: if after that i still doesnt work try purging all the xine packages
[16:43] <lnknpk04> luite, in the meantime, maybe i can get this old USB D-link wireless adapter to work
[16:43] <pipatron> I have problems with bulletproof X now, my machine is *always* using xorg.conf.failsafe
[16:43] <RickJones> i would like to take this oppertunity to think the person last night who suggested that i use the alt install cd. IT WORKED PERFECTLY !!! i now am back on gutsy.
[16:43] <kevinly> minus: i have the same questoin!
[16:43] <astro76> Ditters, have you tried asking here? I'm sure there's a solution
[16:43] <minus> kevinly, :)
[16:43] <minus> kevinly, no one seems to have the answer though
[16:43] <Ditters> yep. I did.

[16:44] <stefg> jdod, google for 'super grub disk' , that'll help you
[16:44] <Vlet> minus: hmm..
[16:44] <hendrixski> zerodamage, oh, the all-in-wonder cards aren't very good.... you may just have to try it, if it works it works, if not... well, just uninstall
[16:44] <minus> Vlet, But I guess I can give it a try again
[16:44] <jdod> lol ok
[16:44] <remix5x> I am having a program running warcraft 3... I have done this in the past, but now when I try to run the executable in wine it tells me to insert the CD even though I mounted an .iso file and put the right entries into the registry!
[16:44] <Ditters> astro76: I can't wait that long. I made a mistake. I thought - what the heck! let's go back to 7.04. .... now I'm cursing
[16:44] <fredl> 256MB just isn't enough anymore to run Ubuntu on these days.
[16:44] <Jo3> anyone have any idea why in xorg.conf it says "Screen         "Default Screen" 0 0" but when i run "aticonfig --resolution=0" it tells me "screen0 does not exist"
[16:44] <boubbin> usser i prolly had wrong repos. now apt wants to download alot of kaffeine xine stuff.
[16:45] <saxin> is deluge a safe client to use? its not on blacklists?

[16:48] <AaronMT> Hi, I have an ATI card with 7.10 in a laptop and I can not suspend/hibernate/resume without it crashing to a black screen. I believe SLUB exposes a bug in fglrx that manifests itself as a failure over suspend/resume. How can I fix this?
[16:48] <kaoticsnow> some tweeks to speed up firefox a bit
[16:48] <fritzchen> how do i partition my hd after installation? i want to divide my active 180GB partition...
[16:49] <usser> boubbin: in terminal try typing which kaffeine or whereis kaffeine
[16:49] <jAk> I've just upgrade to gutsy, well it crashed the pc and was force to re-boot. i am unable to load ubuntu. i get Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0) - anybody what that means?
[16:49] <_achilles_> usser: I just tried updating today
[16:49] <hendrixski> AaronMT, yeah, there's some problems with ATI cards atm... but those should get fixed in a week or two
[16:49] <boubbin> usser i get /usr/bin/kaffeine
[16:49] <Daedalus_Prime> Can anyone help me with my issue?
[16:49] <stefg> fritzchen, /j #ubuntu-de, besser auf Deutsch
[16:49] <jerryb> hendrixski, short answer!  So to be clear, I must first upg to feisty and thence to gutsy?
[16:49] <bsund> deadcandance, type the question :)
[16:49] <nanbudh> is there anyway that i can move my /home to the end of the disk without loosing contents? it is second last one right now
[16:49] <chester66> hello!
[16:49] <Joanki> now that i have ubuntu, the menu bars are SO large... like in firefox, the icons
[16:49] <hendrixski> jerryb, if you want to upgrade from edgy, do it one release at a time... so go to feisty then to gutsy
[16:49] <Joanki> it's like that for ALL of my programs
[16:49] <Joanki> WHY?
[16:49] <Joanki> how do i fix
[16:49] <Joanki> it's hogging my screen
[16:50] <saloxin> everybody upgrading to gutsy has of course read the release notes? http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710
[16:50] <jerryb> hendrixski, ok...thanks!
[16:50] <scriptha> How is /usr/lib chmodded? I kinda of screwed it by accident :$ Can someone take a look?
[16:50] <hendrixski> jerryb, if you have dapper... then when hardy herron comes out, you'll be able to upgrade directly to that... but that only works for LTS ... not for regular releases... for those you have to go incrementally
[16:50] <ghost> hi, do i need to open/or download gnome session to get my audio to work? coz i cant hear anything
=== cobb28_ is now known as cobb28
[16:50] <deadcandance> bsund question :)
[16:50] <kjm> Joanki - your screen resolution is non optimal, reconfigure x
[16:50] <astro76> nanbudh, you'll probably have to clear the destination and copy it
[16:50] <Joanki> it is optimal, i just checked
[16:50] <kbrooks> hendrixski, thats impossible
[16:51] <nanbudh> astro76: so it cannot be shifted somehow?
[16:51] <usser> boubbin: ok try /usr/bin/kaffeince --verbose
[16:51] <hendrixski> kbrooks, what's impossible?
[16:51] <boubbin> usser nothing :/
[16:51] <usser> err *kaffeine
[16:51] <chester66> I have a little question; how is pam_cracklib supposed to work? I enter a dictionary-based password, and passwd asks me for the confirmation of the password I entered
[16:51] <Joanki> i want the icons to be smaller - in my windows, they were very petite
[16:51] <chester66> is it correct?
[16:51] <Ditters> aaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrgggggggggg i'm losing my mind... Evolution doesn't work. it says: Segmentation fault (core dumped). any Ideas?
[16:51] <westjd> I am trying to mount an SMB share, and I got it to work, but I cant get the fstab right (because it didnt reconnect with restart) anyone think they can help me?

[16:51] <boubbin> usser just blank. it gives nothing.
[16:51] <ceed> anyone from usa here?
[16:51] <usser> boubbin: bah damn
[16:51] <astro76> nanbudh, If I'm not mistaken, ext3 cannot be moved, only grown or shrunk... but you can't move it anyway if there is a partition in the way
[16:51] <westjd> ceed, I am from USA
[16:51] <hendrixski> Joanki, that's your monitors defaul setting
[16:51] <Vlet> Ditters: that could be a lot of things... maybe just try Thunderbird?

[16:53] <Vis> Q: I'm trying to use the unofficial 3D windows plugin for compiz on feisty. (1GHz, 1GB, nvidia TI4200) Every time I activate the plugin, compiz crashes. What am I doing wrong?
[16:53] <kjm> Joanki - what is the dpi setting?  Increasing the dpi may help.
[16:53] <astro76> Ditters, you might want to specify your actual problem, as reinstalling hasn't seemed to help
[16:53] <Joanki> how can i make it smaller? i don't like feeling like my screen has shrunk
[16:53] <picard_pwns_kirk> Ditters: sudo apt-get --purge remove evolution or something like that
[16:53] <Joanki> how do i find out dpi setting?
[16:53] <mr_wang> just downloaded 7.10 how do i do checksum???
[16:53] <hendrixski> Dagon, there's an EXPORT command in the Command Line
[16:53] <Joanki> the only real problem is the size of the icon bar to be honest
[16:53] <AaronMT> !md5
[16:53] <Joanki> menu bar
[16:53] <ubotu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[16:53] <kjm> Joanki - by reconfiguring x
[16:53] <ceed> westdj: i think its /usr/apt/
[16:54] <kbrooks> hendrixski, you can't upgrade from X.YY to Z.AA where Y-Z doesn't equal 1. in english: you can't upgrade from dapper drake to hardy heron because the versions of both are 6.06 and 8.04, respectively. you have to upgrade from dapper to edgy, then edgy to feisty. then feisty to gutsy, and finally hardy heron. OR you can reformat.
[16:54] <Joanki> how do i do that, krm
[16:54] <Ditters> picard: it doesn't work
[16:54] <Joanki> kjm
[16:54] <Ditters> astro76: now it says: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[16:54] <hendrixski> Dagon, I don't know if there's an easier way, but if you go to the terminal, there may be a man page for it :-)
[16:54] <astro76> Ditters, right, I'm saying when you repeat your question, specify all the details, you are wasting a lot of time
[16:54] <picard_pwns_kirk> Ditters: why do you want to completely remove it?
[16:54] <jAk> did anybody get my question? hmmm busy here
[16:54] <mr_wang> just downloaded 7.10 how do i do checksum???

[16:54] <astro76> Ditters, which you didn't want to do to fix the problem with 7.10 ;)
[16:54] <DevideZero> hendrixski , i didnt found the official site of the dist ... it have one ?
[16:55] <Jo3> hendrixski, well, im running a pci express card , and it says pci 0:16:0, is that right?
[16:55] <kjm> Joanki : $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[16:55] <Joanki> ok ty
[16:55] <saloxin> ZAKhan: you need the plugin package as well. search in add/remove
[16:55] <hendrixski> kbrooks, you can update from one LTS to another, at least what I heard, so that companies who use those don't have to re-install every six months, or spend days to update to the next one
[16:55] <Ditters> astro76: at 7.10 it was a bug. here it's a problem
[16:55] <edubuntu> Anyone help me with GRUB?

[16:56] <hendrixski> Jo3, I tried switching from what came up on the screen once and it didn't work out too well... just trust the tool
[16:56] <saloxin> jAk: very very bad. consider reinstalling, or using a live cd to recover data you'll miss and reinstall
[16:56] <tehknow> I have no sound

[16:57] <pipegeek> Am I imagining things, or is it impossible to set more than two virtual desktops in gutsy?
[16:57] <Joanki> when possible, this question has been pre-answered for you and you should accept the default unless you know it doesn't work
[16:57] <Joanki> and then it says <ok>
[16:57] <kbrooks> pipegeek, nope. not so.
[16:57] <Joanki> i hit enter nothing happens
[16:57] <hendrixski> edubuntu, you want to remove one of your partititions and get the space back, and then edit grub to not look at that other partition, right?
[16:57] <Ditters> a
[16:57] <brooklynhype> anyone know of widget software on 7.10?

[16:58] <saloxin> pipegeek: hallucinatins. right click - preferences
[16:58] <pipegeek> kbrooks: how is it done (through the gui)?  Because I see no way to do it
[16:58] <astro76> Ditters, what you did to cause the problem, what you have tried, what are the symptoms, etc...
[16:58] <Axos> Dagon: If you are using gnome, set CLASSPATH in ~/.gnomerc
[16:58] <hendrixski> edubuntu, gparted can do that for you... and the first partition you had has the orriginal GRUB which only loads that partition, so you may not even have to edit the grb.conf file :-)
[16:58] <tehknow> woops cox377 thats what I get in the sound preference pane
[16:58] <kbrooks> pipegeek, RT CLICK - PREFS
[16:58] <pipegeek> saloxin: Preferences lets you set columns and rows, but not number of desktops

[17:02] <hendrixski> Jo3, oh no, that doesn't sound good.  umm, you may want to check launchpad if anybody else posted that bug... because that's not normal, and if they did, post your experience, maybe some log files and hopefully soon one of the developers will fix it
[17:02] <pipegeek> solved it

[17:04] <ahnfelt> It's a realtek alc268 card and I've tried with the default ubuntu drivers and realteks own newest drivers
[17:04] <jones-> after upgrading to kernel 2.6.22-14-386, my sound doesn't work anymore in ubuntu gutsy. aplay -l shows that there are no sound devices, but lspci shows that I have a VIA Technologies, Inc. VIA High Definition Audio Controller (rev 10). How can I fix the problem?
[17:04] <ahnfelt> but no sound
[17:05] <brooklynhype> anyone widgets and ubuntu ?
[17:05] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, I haven't heard that, no.  did it work in feisty?

[17:05] <Creepindacellar> hello
[17:05] <Joanki> ok i'm sorry to keep asking this question, but the screen resolution and EVERYTHING is fine except for the size of the icons - you know in firefox how it has the back forward icons?  you can easily adjust that to make them SMALL icons so they don't hog your screen - how do i do that for evolution or other applications?
[17:05] <saloxin> jAk: it might be possible to correct. but it's pita and should be avoided
[17:05] <brooklynhype> like to use desktop widgets on ubuntu?
[17:05] <johncub> saloxin, I was rather hoping it would have made it to /lost+found or somewhere.  shrug
[17:05] <hendrixski> Joanki, are you sure it's not a firefox theme you installed?
[17:06] <vocx> brooklynhype, what? I don't get what you are asking.
[17:06] <hendrixski> Joanki, or is it all applications, and not just firefox?
[17:06] <Qahwaji> hendrixski, i never used fiesty, but before that i used to get it to work by changing some settings for wireless, but now neither wired or wireless works, plus takes about 15 mins to start up
[17:06] <kbrosnan> Joanki: you would need to find a gnome theme with small icons
[17:06] <Creepindacellar> can anyone help with a wireless network setup in 7.10
[17:06] <johncub> Joanki, have you tried other overall themes for gnome?
[17:06] <Joanki> no firefox is fine now
[17:06] <astro76> Joanki, in Feisty you can change that in System > Preferences > Menu and Toolbar Preferences, I'm not sure if it's the same in Gutsy
[17:06] <Vis> Brooklynhype: Sounds like you need to look at either Screenlets or gdesklets
[17:06] <Joanki> i fixed firefox
[17:06] <libervisco> Hi, I tried booting AMD64 Gutsy livecd, but it puts my LCD to standby and stops, even when I set the resolution myself and even in safe mode
[17:06] <saloxin> johncub: you can go haywire and do "strings /dev/sda1 | less "
[17:06] <Joanki> ok ty kbrosnan
[17:06] <mikeo2> who has a detailed list of exactly what the do-release-upgrade thing does?
[17:06] <brooklynhype> gotcha forgot the names, thx !
[17:06] <Heaven> ok, seems not then what about that game cube 2 ? made on some german engine?
[17:07] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, what's the problem with wireless?
[17:07] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, that's not normal.  how old is the computer?
[17:07] <jAk> saloxin : forgive me. What is you recommandation?
[17:07] <saloxin> johncub: but that might be huge
[17:07] <Vis> np
[17:07] <astro76> Joanki, there you can change it to icons only which makes it small
[17:07] <libervisco> I remember Feisty doing the same, but it worked after I set the resolution myself, now that doesn't work either
[17:07] <Creepindacellar> im not sure but i have no connection
[17:07] <saloxin> jAk: boot live cd. backup stuff you
[17:07] <Qahwaji> not too old maybe 2 years old
[17:07] <libervisco> and it's such a basic thing
[17:07] <johncub> saloxin, thanks I'll let this complete and then give that a shot if I get no love.  :P
[17:07] <MrBister> I checked creative's home for Audigy drivers for linux, but found none. Am I doomed to live without audio??
[17:07] <jvargas> hi

[17:07] <jvargas> i got problem with audio
[17:07] <Qahwaji> it picks up a wireless network, but whne i put in the key it  doenst do anything
[17:07] <libervisco> Any ideas?
[17:07] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, do you know wich chipset are you using?
[17:08] <manic12> if i have a 7.04 cd, should i bother with the 7.10 download, or should i install 7.04 and let ubuntu patch itself?
[17:08] <Creepindacellar> ive put in my wep not sure if it should be ascii or hex
[17:08] <MrBister> Audigy drivers available somewhere?
[17:08] <pavell> hi guys, i got a strange printing problem under gutsy. can't print from gutsy's built-in pdf viewer. printing from openoffice works

[17:08] <jAk> saloxin : Brillient, u been very helpful... Thanks - I will download the live cd iso now and start again... ;)
[17:08] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, doesn't matter, it seems that your chipset is running ok
[17:08] <[R]> hendrixski when i move my panels to right or left of my screen im left with a black line 3/4 of the way down and my mouse cant go past that
[17:08] <[R]> « 12:09:pm» <+[R]> so i have to move it all the way to the top so i can get to the bottom of my screen
[17:08] <sardanapalos> i get a fail message when i try to install anything when it should be dowloading the files through "add remove apps" menu.can somebody help me plz???
[17:09] <Creepindacellar> it worked in 7.04
[17:09] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, you're using that little network manager on the top right hand side, right?
[17:09] <manic12> astro76: ok, seems to want to take a long time though :\
[17:09] <Creepindacellar> i went from the 64 bit version to the 32 bit version though
[17:09] <Qahwaji> hendrixi yes i am,
[17:09] <Creepindacellar> no wine support in 64 bit
[17:09] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, so, you are trying to connect to your wireless network that's protected with a wep key?
[17:09] <hendrixski> [R], what happens if you restart your xserver after moving them (ctrl-alt-backspace)?
[17:09] <Creepindacellar> yes
[17:09] <hendrixski> [R], it makes you log back in afterwards
[17:09] <kkathman> i downloaded an icon set and untarred it - how would I use that set now
[17:09] <qanw> is there any way I can downgrade a *specific* package to its feisty equivalent?
[17:09] <Creepindacellar> not sure if the device is there or not
[17:10] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, and you can see your network with networkmanager?
[17:10] <manic12> what is a fast north american mirror, UTD is slow as molasses
[17:10] <vocx> sardanapalos, what happens when you try using the command line "sudo apt-get install <package>" ? Does it give you an error?
[17:10] <Creepindacellar> yes i see the router
[17:10] <vocx> manic12, read topic
[17:10] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, Then your drivers are probably no good... there's a tool for that, called NDIS-wrapper
[17:10] <liberum> Since I upgraded to Gutsy, all videos are jerky in VLC. It seems like the larger the video picture, the jerkier it gets
[17:10] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, so, when you click on the network name in networkmanager, you're asked for the password
[17:10] <jvargas> any idea about my audio problem, playing at session start but not after that ?
[17:10] <sardanapalos> i don't know how to use this command - newbie in linux can u help me vocx ?
[17:10] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, or... maybe... try using the wireless somewhere else... maybe there's interference in your current area?
[17:11] <Creepindacellar> not asked per say but the field opens up
[17:11] <Creepindacellar> password field
[17:11] <vocx> !apt > sardanapalos
[17:11] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, I hope that gets you on the right track... I have to go now... there's tons of guides about NDIS-Wrapper, it should be easy to use.

[17:11] <slackern> kkathman: usually i just unpack the archive, open up my home folder with nautilus and press control+h to show hidden files and then copy the folder containing the new icons into the .icons folder and they should show up in the theme manager
[17:12] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, and if you know your password in the form: "mypassword" you should select the filed: "ascii wep" or "64/128 ascii wep"
[17:12] <mstuefer> gutsy, fglrx, 2.6.22-14-386, xorg => X does not work :( someone knows where the problem stays??
[17:12] <hendrixski> Qahwaji, like I said, it's probably the driver for the wireless card.  it may not be handling the signals well and crashing your system.  imy suggestion is to try NDIS-Wrapper
[17:12] <Creepindacellar> and i do have a wep key for my router, should i use hex or ascii wep?
[17:12] <hendrixski> [R], I hope that the restarting the xserver works for you,  I gotta go

[17:12] <pengo> Creepindacellar: does it contain anything other than 1234567890ABCDEF ?
[17:12] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, you can use both, but what changes is the caracters associated with the password

[17:21] <JarG0n> Can someone tell me why this is in my /etc/fstab ?  UUID=a454246c-4d5d-4454-875a-253545876842  /dev/sda1 is commented out with #.
[17:21] <m11> Daedalus_Prime: u tried em all i bet ?
[17:21] <Creepindacellar> i see them i select mine and iput my key and wep 64/128  ascii
[17:21] <ompaul> Daedalus_Prime, funny I got several different wireless cards to work using that
[17:21] <liberum> PanicByte: Yep :-/&
[17:21] <Creepindacellar> login to network is greyed out
[17:21] <Daedalus_Prime> I looked through all of the wifi docs, they do not pertain to my issue.
[17:21] <mortal1> Daedalus_Prime, given that wep can be cracked in under a minute, I just limit by mac address
[17:21] <Daedalus_Prime> My device WORKS, I just can't get internet
[17:21] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, so the problem is that your Wep key is longer than 128 bits
[17:21] <vocx> A[D]minS, seems like you are missing codecs... don't know. Give further info to the channel.
[17:21] <PanicByte> liberum, i disabled the binary only drivers, and it seemed to work ok after that, if that is your case
[17:21] <m11> Daedalus_Prime: and what is your issue ?
[17:21] <Creepindacellar> it is 10 characters
[17:22] <vocx> !codecs > A[D]minS
[17:22] <PanicByte> liberum,  i have a feeling it's just a setting screwed up in VLC somewhere
[17:22] <liberum> PanicByte: where do i disable the binary only drivers?
[17:22] <Daedalus_Prime> When I select my wireless network fromt he drop down in the network tray icon, it asks for the passphrase, WEP key (128/64bit), etc
[17:22] <Creepindacellar> i used passphrase and the login button is available but no connection

[17:23] <Blair_> anyone feel like helping me get 7.10 x64 on my laptop?
[17:23] <ghost> hi, i need help with sound still, i cant hear anything, only microphone
[17:23] <PanicByte> System > Administration > restricted drivers manager
[17:23] <Daedalus_Prime> I select WEP 128/64bit, and enter my key (which is 0FB3DFF65D) and nothing.
[17:23] <Vlet> !upgrade | Blair_
[17:23] <ubotu> Blair_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[17:23] <snot> the other day I installed ubuntu on my mates ps3... it runs damn slow! is that just the way it is or is there some booster package that I forgot?
[17:23] <PanicByte> liberum, System > Administration > restricted drivers manager
[17:23] <Daedalus_Prime> Should I use WEP Hexidecimal or ASCII?
[17:23] <nvictor> hey guys
[17:23] <liberum> PanicByte: But it worked fine in feisty... and i kind of like having 3D :)
[17:23] <PanicByte> liberum, yeah, it's weird
[17:23] <snot> Daedalus_Prime: neither, wpa
[17:24] <nvictor> does not ubuntu come with a c++ compiler?
[17:24] <Joanki> does ubuntu come with gcc?
[17:24] <Jo3> hendrixski, does anyone know why when I enable ati 3d drivers I cant get my screen res over 800x600?
[17:24] <Blair_> no, It's not the problem with upgrading, X refuses to start properly, but I don't get the usual error message
[17:24] <sardanapalos> anybody to help me?
[17:24] <m11> Daedalus_Prime: u only know how you configured your router, play a bit with the options . but WEP is not to be used
[17:24] <Creepindacellar> it says im connected
[17:24] <PanicByte> liberum, poke around in the VLC settings
[17:24] <Jo3> hendrixski, sry didnt mean to message you
[17:24] <Creepindacellar> i have an ip now
[17:24] <nvictor> Joanki: :)
[17:24] <Jo3> does anyone know why when I enable ati 3d drivers I cant get my screen res over 800x600?
[17:24] <Blair_> you always have an IP
[17:24] <Daedalus_Prime> Alright, I will give WPA a try and see if that works.
[17:24] <edulix> hi!
[17:24] <Daedalus_Prime> brb
[17:24] <Blair_> yes
[17:24] <Joanki> heh
[17:24] <Creepindacellar> there it is!!!!!!
[17:24] <edulix> anyone knows which command should I use to enable keyboard autorepeat?
[17:24] <Creepindacellar> yea!!!!!!
[17:24] <Vlet> Blair_: so what's the error?
[17:24] <Blair_> Jo3- you need proper video drivers
[17:24] <Dumptruck> I think I have everything set up for dual boot - all I need to do is repair the boot.ini for XP can someone look at my menu.lst and make sure it looks good?
[17:24] <Blair_> video drivers I believe
[17:24] <Dumptruck> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41352/
[17:24] <Creepindacellar> thank you airbender
[17:24] <vocx> sardanapalos, don't ask if anyone will help you, it becomes annoying... Anyway. It seems like the servers are down or maybe you are using strange repositories.
[17:24] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, ok you're welcome
[17:25] <KOSHrf> hi, is there any taskbar that looks like the MacOSX one for gnome?
[17:25] <Blair_> I can't get onto the live CD without the secreen "scrambling"
[17:25] <MrBister> jo3> check the faq
[17:25] <JarG0n> Can someone tell me why this is in my /etc/fstab ?  UUID=a454246c-4d5d-4454-875a-253545876842  /dev/sda1 is commented out with #.  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41353/
[17:25] <MrEgg964> Hi all, I'm trying to fresh install Gutsy. I have 3 hds : sda=xp, sdb=data, sdc=gutsy. I've already partionned sdc into 3 partitions (/, /home and swap). My problem is that after installation is complete, I don't have a GRUB menu, and the computer boots automatically into XP. Any suggestion welcome.
[17:25] <Blair_> I have a nVidia GeForce 6150 go (it's a laptop)
[17:25] <src> JarG0n, so /dev/sda1 is not being mounted at boot time
[17:25] <sardanapalos> sorry guys i am new to linux and trying to make it work for 2 days now without luck
[17:25] <Blair_> I tried starting up with "vga=771 noapic no lapic"
[17:25] <m11> MrEgg964: did u set B ?
[17:25] <Dumptruck> Mregg964: did you adjust the boot priority?
[17:25] <Noble> can anyone direct me to good software to let me use my 88 key Midi controller (keyboard) in linux?
[17:26] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, so, I think your Password is not WEP, but WPA-PSK
[17:26] <JarG0n> src> isn't it supposed to be?
[17:26] <tomd123> Please help, how do I stop gutsy from automounting my windows partitions? I don't want to be reminded of my dark past :P
[17:26] <Jo3> MrBister, right, when i run  aticonfig --resolution=0,1600x1200,1280x1024,1024x768, I get,  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[17:26] <MrEgg964> Dumptruck: I did ajust the boot priority in the BIOS, but to no avail.
[17:26] <vocx> sardanapalos, "sudo apt-get update"      How did you install Gutsy? Somebody helped you? Did you install the official CD or one of the beta releases?
[17:26] <Vis> Noble: You might want to take a look at UbuntuStudio. Not sure but its probably preconfigured
[17:26] <src> JarG0n, the only thing that needs to be mounted is swap and the system, the rest is optional
[17:26] <bulmer> tomd123: remove the entries in /etc/fstab
[17:26] <mutable> Hello does anybody here use alpine? What is the default location of PASSFILE? How could I find out if alpine was compiled with password cacheing feature?
[17:27] <juan> has anyone had problem with compiz and gnome-art manager?
[17:27] <bulmer> mutable what is alpine?
[17:27] <JarG0n> src> thx.  Do you know what the UUID means?  Is it just a hardware ident?
[17:27] <sardanapalos> it is the original cd, i downloaded yesterday and installed it myself,no beta
[17:27] <saloxin> sardanapalos: apt-get is not reaching webservers? box online at all?
[17:27] <mutable> bulmer: pine, new
[17:27] <_thomas> hi
[17:27] <_thomas> i've got a dual core cpu and I was testing it a bit, and i saw super_pi only uses one of the 2 cores, how can I set it to use both?
[17:27] <Jo3> blair, I have the most current ati xorg drivers
[17:27] <JarG0n> src> I just don't recall changing this to UUIDs.
[17:27] <Creepindacellar> ok heres my next one, trying to use nvidia  gforce6600 when i go to enable proprietary drivers it says coure package for nvidia-glx-new is not enabled
[17:27] <Blair_> I am having hardware issues with my laptop, I cannot start off the LiveCD without it hanging
[17:27] <vocx> tomd123, there is an option in /etc/fstab "noauto"  read "man mount" and "man fstab" for more info
[17:27] <Nematocyst> jarg0n fstab uses the drive IDs so that it mounts correctly even if the drives get switched.  it's nothing to worry about
[17:27] <Creepindacellar> coure=source
[17:27] <sardanapalos> i am able to use mozilla and open web but cannot install or update anything
[17:27] <teKnofreak> how do i get multiple workspaces, i.e. >2, if i select 4 in desktop preference i get 8 workspaces instead where only 4 works
[17:27] <JarG0n> Nematocyst> cool beans.
[17:27] <vocx> !fstab > tomd123
[17:27] <bulmer> mutable the mail client  pine?
[17:28] <saloxin> _thomas: probably super_pi doesn't support multiple cpu's. use cpu #2 for something else
[17:28] <mutable> bulmer: yes
[17:28] <JarG0n> Nematocyst> Is there a way I can query the drive IDs?
[17:28] <bulmer> mutable why would it need a passfile?
[17:28] <_thomas> saloxin: yeah, but I want to see how fast I can make it go
[17:28] <mutable> bulmer: to store passwords
[17:28] <saloxin> _thomas: bummer
[17:28] <src> JarG0n, it's the identifier for the filesystem
[17:28] <atouk> is there a master list of all packages available with apt-get?
[17:28] <_thomas> saloxin: so there is no way of assigning it to 2 cpu's?
[17:28] <nvictor> does not ubuntu come with a c++ compiler?
[17:28] <bulmer> mutable linux systems usually uses /etc/passwd with /etc/shadow as the real one
[17:28] <Pacane> Can someone help me with my Nvidia drivers/Xconfig? I'm getting an error message at the install....
[17:28] <src> JarG0n, like an easy to remember name universally applicable
[17:29] <saloxin> _thomas: programs need to support it themselves
[17:29] <cratel> nvictor: apt-get install build-essential
[17:29] <wdsaeghe> Hmm, C compiler cannot create executables..
[17:29] <Blair_> can I have a private chat with someone? I need help with installation on a laptop, I've tried the usual workarounds but I still can't make it work
[17:29] <script> русские тут есть?
[17:29] <_thomas> nvictor: install gcc etc
[17:29] <tomd123> bulmer, thankyou
[17:29] <mutable> bulmer: to store password for some email accounts :)
[17:29] <_thomas> nvictor: g++
[17:29] <vocx> nvictor, you need to install "build-essential" package. For further info head to the programming forum in ubuntuforums.org
[17:29] <script> русские тут есть?
[17:29] <nvictor> thanks
[17:29] <zaggy-nl> So, how's ubuntu 7.10 for you folks?
[17:29] <bulmer> tomd123: you're welcome
[17:29] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, just accept the message and it should start to download this package automatically
[17:29] <script> русские тут есть?
[17:29] <JarG0n> src> is there a way to query for the UUID?
[17:29] <Jo3> does anyone know why when I enable ati 3d drivers I cant get my screen res over 800x600?

[17:30] <JarG0n> slackern> thx :)
[17:30] <Vlet> Blair_: there are a lot of people in here - the chances of one person knowing the answer to your questions are small... why not ask everyone?
[17:30] <src> JarG0n, /dev/disk/by-uuid
[17:30] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, If for any reason It doesn't, just open the "Synaptic Package Manager" and search by name: nvidia-glx-new, then mark the package for install and click on "Apply"

[17:31] <KebabBob> I had to install xgl to get compiz to work... but for some reason my keyboard layout has changed, and my dual monitor setup has gone weird - X insists that it's only 1 screen, 3200x1600 and centers all windows so a window is on both screens.. Can I somehow reset this to how it was before?
[17:31] <Blair_> Thank you all for your time, I'm gonna go try the forums, but I'll most likely be back later. Thanks again!
[17:31] <depinko> hello, after installing the new 7.10 the autocompletion after sudo doesn't works, is there any solution to enable it back?

[17:37] <FireTalon> is there any way to set the composite effects when you enable them?

[17:39] <lucaferr> how can I install OpenType (otf) fonts?
[17:39] <telekine> andrew try clicking on the edit themes tab
[17:39] <vocx> zap0, what is DOS?       Nano should do it. There is also "joe" and "vim" is really easy if you just want to write and save.

[17:41] <krityx> ok, so i installed ubuntu but chose not to install the boot loader, and now i want to add linux to windows' NTLDR (boot.ini) and i dont know what to add
[17:41] <NemesisD> saloxin, yeah i think i can go plug it into my router
[17:41] <andrew_> ok what am i looking for in 'edit themes' also
[17:41] <andrew_> Actually, fusion-icon is pretty close to what I had with Beryl. It gives me an icon in the tray I can right-click and then choose my wm (compiz or Metacity) and my window decorator (Emerald or GTK). Of course, when I choose emerald, I lose the window decorations, so I'm stuck with GTK, but that's getting off-topic.

[17:41] <hammer123> is the upgrade to 7.10 ok for everyone? do you do a clean install or just software upgrade?
[17:41] <andrew_> do i lose the eyecandy that comes with gutsy if i turn on an emerald theme?

[17:42] <[chr0n0s]> teKnofreak, is here!
[17:42] <cobb28> saloxin: thank you
[17:42] <krityx> uhm, anyone ?
[17:42] <markstos> hammer123: I'd recommend a software upgrade, unless your current system is messed up or very complicated.
[17:42] <joerack> Hello! Can someone help me with  Intel gma 950 driver installation please
[17:42] <Daedalus_Prime> Is there a way to downgrade to 7.04?
[17:42] <NemesisD> saloxin, my only problem i can forsee is that my wireless connection was set up as eth1, so im hoping its not overriding my actual ethernet port in any way...
[17:42] <Creepindacellar> i searched and didn't find any " backports"
[17:42] <depinko> src, I've copied them to my home, but it doesn't helps
[17:42] <hammer123> will i lose any settings or personal file if do a software upgrade?
[17:42] <zap0> dmnd, vocx:  im back.. thanks.. i apt-get'd then edited the smb.conf  with nano..  primitve editor but tolerable ;)    now that i've eidted smb.conf  how do i force it to re-read it ?
[17:43] <saloxin> NemesisD: should be ok, sounds like wire is eth0
[17:43] <vocx> krityx, don't ask "anyone"? It is very annoying while we type. Why do you want to boot Ubuntu from WIndows boot loader. Use Grub instead.
=== aryr100 is now known as aryr100-afk

[17:43] <dmnd> zap0: /etc/init.d/samba reload
[17:43] <TwoD> Hey all, I'm having trouble booting Gutsy after upgrading from Feisty. I get the Ubuntu loading screen (bar full), it goes back to commandline when trying to read the config file, screen goes black a couple of times and then it stops at the command line output, no promt so I can't type commands... Starting in recovery mode works, but I forgot how to try loading Gnome from there.
[17:43] <markstos> krityx: That sounds like more of a windows question, since it is about the windows boot loader. Try asking the Windows community.
[17:43] <dmnd> or whatever it's called :)
[17:43] <Creepindacellar> save?
[17:43] <src> depinko, make sure you're really using bash and if yes, reinstall it
[17:43] <krityx> well i tried using grub and had unpleasant experiences with it
[17:43] <Tornado> In Ubuntu 7.10 im losing connectivity to my wireless connection randomly for no apparent reason. How can I try to repair the connection or disable the whole adapter and reenable it? Using the network icon in the upper right corner of the desktop does nothing.
[17:43] <zap0> dmnd, thanks.

[17:45] <ezebe> can i disable the extra graphics features in gutsy? i  have an ancient nvidia card that only worked well in simple graphics sessions (i.e. not composite or something?) in feisty. now in gutsy it's v slow without restricted drivers, and 640x480 & glitchy if i try to use nvidia-legacy driver like i did in feisty. i think this is beacuse its forcing composite extensions or something. thanks
[17:45] <Daedalus_Prime> no prob, i had the same issue so I tried that and it loaded up my UI fine.

[17:47] <penguin42> Daedalus_Prime: No, download is probably not doable
[17:47] <MrBister> howdy
[17:47] <ompaul> valmarko, no, AND by default it does not need one
[17:47] <GRocket> No
[17:47] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, It will start to update the packages list
[17:47] <AlexUbuntuBcn> hi friends! somone can help me please? mi problem is about the java, but in the #java channel culdn't help me or don't like to help me...

[17:48] <luk3> hi all i upates to gusty yesterday, i had a dual boot system with xp and grub as the loader, after my upgrade xp is no longer in my boot list. i have added i back into the list as hd0,1 as before but it is not booting. can anyone help?
[17:48] <Daedalus_Prime> That sucks... everything worked great on Feisty, but no joy for my internet on Gutsy
[17:48] <telekine> indio: yes we can
[17:48] <Can0beans_> I turned on compiz last night and it worked like a champ.  Started up this morning and now all I get is a black desktop wallpaper.  Looked at Xorg.log and syslog and found nothing.  Any other suggestions on where i should look to see what the problem is?
[17:48] <ezebe> can i disable the x-extensions in gutsy? they never worked with my ancient nvidia card in feisty, but now i think they're screwing me by default.
[17:48] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, after it finishes, you will be able to enable the nvidia-glx-new just clicking in the restricted drivers manager, or if you want, by installing the package from Synaptic Package Manager
[17:48] <NemesisD> saloxin, ok its connected did you mean literally the command "sudo dpkg --configure -a / apt-get -f install" ?
[17:48] <vanberge> is there any way to just run the ubuntu installation from the cd?  vs. starting the stupid live cd and installing from there?
[17:48] <valmarko> ompaul, that means that, if I test the ports using, for example, www.grc.com, the system will pass ?
[17:48] <fredl> luk3 - you chose to use the entire disk ?
[17:48] <Creepindacellar> ok thanks
[17:48] <saloxin> indio: if the live cd is giving you trouble you might try the alternate cd
[17:48] <indio> Can I change refresh rate and screen resolution of  the installation CD ?
[17:48] <GRocket> ompaul...is there a way to speed up Firefox in 7.10?
[17:48] <joerack> Hello! Can someone can I have a hint at least for Intel gma 950 driver installation please
[17:48] <saloxin> NemesisD: 2 commands, separated by /
[17:48] <penguin42> vanberge: There is an 'alternate CD' that is just an installer
[17:48] <MrBister> Can someone tell me how to install drivers for Soundblaster Audigy 2?
[17:48] <luk3> fredl no i have a 75 gig drive with 20 for xp
[17:48] <indio> saloxin: dowloading it right now, thanks
[17:49] <NemesisD> saloxin, ok and in that order yes?
[17:49] <AirBender> Creepindacellar, and after that, click on the icon showing you that there are updates available
[17:49] <penguin42> joerack: 950 is graphics ?
[17:49] <ompaul> valmarko, it should be nice unless you installed some server software it should be like a sink on the internet
[17:49] <saloxin> NemesisD: yep
[17:49] <sinisterguy> it there any way to dual boot os x and ubuntu without bootcamp?
[17:49] <Creepindacellar> ok
[17:49] <vocx> GRocket, get a faster processor and more RAM?
[17:49] <vanberge> penguin42, i saw that...  but is there any other way? or is that it..
[17:49] <joerack> Intel GMA 950 integrated
[17:49] <luk3> gsty was a system update not a fresh install
[17:49] <fredl> luk3 - when you choose XP, does it start up and break somewhere ?
[17:49] <saloxin> indio: at least you get it installed and more tools to fix the resolution problems
[17:49] <ompaul> valmarko, and grc is aimed a t insecure windows not the tank that is Linux
[17:49] <Can0beans_> I should also mention, I'm running Gutsy
[17:49] <indio> Just thought it would be possible to boot the live CD in a custom screen resolution.
[17:49] <penguin42> vanberge: Not really, alternate is the way to do it if you don't want the prettyness of the live cd
[17:49] <luk3> no it does not even load jus stays in the menu
[17:49] <vanberge> penguin42, otherwise i might just do a clean install of 7.04 and do the distribution update with update manager
[17:50] <saloxin> indio: might be. push F3 or somesuch at the prompt
[17:50] <ompaul> GRocket, so I would type "about:config" in the browser and filter for IPv6 and turn it off
[17:50] <Al-Khouli> Does anyone have an idea about establishing a connection via bluetooth on gutsy ??
[17:50] <penguin42> joerack: I think a 950 should just work
[17:50] <fredl> luk3 - do sudo fdisk /dev/hda, type 'p' to print the partition information and tell me which partitions you see
[17:50] <zulfiqar> saloxin, is there an easy guide to make it work for firefox?
[17:50] <penguin42> joerack: Most of the intel graphics cards just mostly work
[17:50] <valmarko> ompaul, could you suggest me another site ? thank you
[17:50] <Daedalus_Prime> So does anyone have any other ideas on how to get the Linsys USB adapter to work under 7.10? I looked at the docs, nothing. I tried upper and lower case for my key in every type of option the connection wizard offered, nothing.
[17:50] <vocx> fredl, luk3 use "sudo fdisk -l"
[17:50] <MrBister> Can someone tell me how to install drivers for Soundblaster Audigy 2?
[17:50] <joerack> penguin42: unfortunately my max resolution is 1024 so I doubt it
[17:50] <saloxin> zulfiqar: dunno. should be. check wiki.ubuntu.com
[17:51] <penguin42> joerack: So you mean it's working but the resolution is wrong?
[17:51] <luk3> ok have one
[17:51] <MrBister> no here using audigy soundcard??
[17:51] <fredl> luk3 so you still see your XP partition?
[17:51] <ompaul> valmarko, you have missed the point, point grc at your machine by all means. However "insecure" on windows is not the same as "not locked up" GNU/Linux
[17:51] <indio> Bye thanks all.
[17:51] <bulmer> Daedalus_Prime: without encryption, does it work?

[17:57] <cratel> I'm trying to resize my ext3 partition from live CD but gnome keep auto mounting it whenever I unmount. how do I disable this?
[17:57] <jvargas> it plays at startup and when session is started
[17:57] <slicks_mage> yes i know but i like aim by itself

[17:57] <jnc> KebabBob: a firefox extension that reads mouse button clicks would do it, but I don't know if there is one existing already
[17:57] <pazsion> linux support is community support supposedly...
[17:57] <joerack> i-m on ultimateubuntu which i guess is 7.04
[17:57] <NemesisD> saloxin, ok we got problems, im running through dpkg --configure -a again, and i'm getting a lot of packages saying there is a dependency problem and that its leaving them unconfigured
[17:57] <jnc> it's not really a function of the window manager to tell a web browser what to do, and X11 just passes mouse button clicks to the WM

[17:58] <skotos> Can I get help with my Dell that came preinstalled with Ubuntu here?
[17:58] <telekine> andrew__: you still there
[17:58] <warlock> .
[17:58] <openforlife> skotos: sure :)
[17:58] <vocx> skotos, of course, but there is also a Dell subforum in ubuntuforums.org
[17:58] <pazsion> skotos i also have a dell with ubuntu on it
[17:58] <saloxin> NemesisD: easiest will be to do a fresh install. alternative is to manually resolve the deps with dpkg -i. I spent 1hour+ doing that yesterday.
[17:59] <Dumptruck> Problem: Apparently I am unable to repair my boot.ini from the Windows XP recovery console - it needs to access the hd with ubuntu on it (I am thinking the boot sector - is there anyway to update/repair my boot.ini file from Ubuntu?  Any help would be much appreciated.
[17:59] <giuseppe> hi, i have 2 disk sata configured as RAID 0 by bios.. but ubuntu 7.10 detect them as separate disks.. any ideas?

[17:59] <sen5421> hi... I keep losing my eth0 connection. I am running a laptop with an intel ethernet 100 nic and also an intel IPW3945 nic...  How can I reconfigure networking?
[17:59] <NemesisD> saloxin, ill take the latter :) how do i do it though
[17:59] <valmarko> ompaul, just to finish, I would remind you that my first question was related to ubuntu security capabilities. is it offtopic. And, is it offtopic to ask for an alternative that can test its security ? Ya... that's what I call a ubuntu philosophy. Take care, stranger
[17:59] <oritemis> hi

[18:00] <sen5421> there is not way to get an IP address

[18:00] <nanonyme> spiker611, most people just use userdir
[18:00] <saloxin> NemesisD: it's tricky. mount disk, chroot into it, mount the cdrom pool, dpkg -i untill dpkg --configure -a is happy
[18:00] <krityx> thanks vocx
[18:01] <spiker611> nanonyme what do you mean userdir?
[18:01] <brooklynhype> windows media player type software ?
[18:01] <saloxin> NemesisD: i recommend just backing up your data and doing fresh install

[18:01] <pazsion> i had to re-install to get around it, tho it tried to fix the problem i had the same issue on boot up
[18:01] <ompaul> valmarko, specific port stuff would be okay, but a rambling discussion is not appropriate to a support channel, thus would be OT

I've edited it completely out of my xfce startup programs file but it still runs three times.  Where is it being called from so I can pare it down to only one instace?
[18:03] <bruenig> sen5421, I don't know that you reset, that assumes that there is some backed up thing which can be reverted, just configure it how you need
[18:03] <skotos> don't know how to do that. I'm an RHCT. This is my first debian type system.
[18:03] <sen5421> my eth0 connection drops... and when it does it is GONE
[18:03] <guardian> is gutsy supposed to support emu 1212 soundcards ? cause i upgraded and alsa doesn't see any sound card :(
[18:03] <pazsion> Foug, i got this program free and it worked flawlessly and easily...windows xp i beleive
[18:03] <kilo_ccnp> I don't know insalled Ubuntu?
[18:03] <panosru> jnc, ok if i copy it and paste it in gedit characters works

[18:03] <pazsion> might wrok for ya
[18:04] <NemesisD> saloxin, but further to the point, this computer i'm on right now I don't know how i'm going to upgrade it. it was way harder to set up. do you think its a matter of time before whatever borked my upgrade is fixed?
[18:04] <chrisb_> Anyone out there get the tracker tool fully functioning with 7.10?  I've managed to get the trackerd daemon to index everything on my system now according to "tracker-stats", but nothing comes up when searching still...
[18:04] <jnc> panosru: sorry, that's the best I could think of
[18:04] <oritemis> telekine: I had no beryl-manager installed. I installed compi-fusion.
[18:04] <Tomi_G> Problem: I don't see my NTFS partition called "Storage". Yes, I am certain that I didn't format it while installing Gutsy :D Anyone?
[18:04] <sen5421> bruenig, I have a ethernet nic and ipw3945 wireless nic... how do I get them to JUST WORK?
[18:04] <telekine> oritemis right, sorry
[18:04] <panosru> jnc, ok i'm curious why if i save the file it not works.
[18:04] <mehevi> Tomi_G can you see it when you type in 'fdisk' by itself?
[18:04] <mic> hi
[18:04] <jnc> panosru: when possible it is a good idea to save as UTF-8 encoding
[18:04] <sen5421> bruenig, they are broken.
[18:04] <saloxin> NemesisD: heh. don't upgrade untill other machine is ok. otherwise no comp for you ;-)
[18:04] <mic> ppc (ps3) install does not succeed
[18:04] <Dumptruck> jnc: everything is set up for dual boot however when I boot into XP from grub I get an error message
[18:04] <bruenig> sen5421, just work is a stupid term, ubuntu has all of this abstraction stuff that I am not familiar with, but it can be made to work from the command line, they aren't broken
[18:04] <mic> installation breaks at 82%
[18:04] <oritemis> Dr_willis: yes, I am using it. yes there that those two buttons, but no more itens.
[18:04] <panosru> jnc, the file is .txt which is created through windows
[18:04] <Dr_willis> oritemis, You are using Gutsy or Feisty?
[18:05] <Dumptruck> hal.dll file corrupt or missing
[18:05] <saloxin> NemesisD: difficult to say without knowing what broke you upgrade
[18:05] <penguin42> sen5421: The nic should just work; wireless can take a bit more
[18:05] <oritemis> Dr_willis: I am Gutsy.
[18:05] <NemesisD> saloxin, just got a bunch of dependency problems
[18:05] <Dumptruck> directly related to the boot.ini missing or corrupt
[18:05] <mehevi> mic can you say it all on one line it is really spammy to use the return key as punctuation
[18:05] <Cpudan80> Dumptruck: Did you let ubuntu partition your drive?
[18:05] <valmarko> ompaul, you're the boss :) 'rambling discussion' is a relative term but... my mistake. I was used to other kind of criteria. Well... sorry again for the offtopic.
[18:05] <Dumptruck> make any sense?
[18:05] <sen5421> bruenig, hehe... sure they are... after this 'break' happens then a device eth0:avah appears.
[18:05] <Dr_willis> oritemis,   on mine its under perferances -> (backend has a pull down menu) select flat file.
[18:05] <looghmoo> help me, i'm using ati mobile redeon x1400, when boot gusty shown blank screen

[18:05] <Dumptruck> One NTFS with Ubuntu rolling
[18:05] <vocx> !ntfs > Tomi_G
[18:06] <sen5421> penguin42, the nic does NOT just work... after this 'break' it can no longer be used.
[18:06] <saloxin> looghmoo: known issue -> http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710
[18:06] <bruenig> sen5421, I assume ubuntu is still using ipw3945d instead of the new iwlwifi firmware that is daemonless or do you know? can anyone us figure this out?
[18:06] <Dumptruck> jnc: you lost me
[18:06] <mehevi> Tomi_G ok my bad type in fdisk /dev/yourharddrive
[18:06] <sen5421> bruenig, yes
[18:06] <jnc> Dumptruck: you wanted to edit boot.ini on NTFS?
[18:06] <Cpudan80> Dumptruck: OK, so you need to recover the boot.ini
[18:06] <mehevi> Tomi_G it is usually /dev/hda or /dev/sda
[18:06] <sen5421> bruenig, that is the driver I have running on my system

[18:07] <sen5421> penguin42, do you know about the bridge-utils package?
[18:07] <bruenig> sen5421, there are two modules for it though that can be used an old one which requires a userspace daemon and one which does not, do you know which one ubuntu uses?
[18:07] <foug> pazsion: which program?
[18:07] <mehevi> aoupi try lspci?
[18:07] <outofrange> Not a good update.  Lost my wireless.  Kernel (dmesg) doesn't say anything about wireless when booting.
[18:07] <charles> can someone give me their sources.list file for gutsy, update manager freezes up, get repository errors, all i have installed is wine.

[18:08] <apollo2011> hi everyone. I ran through the procedure to upgrade from Feisty to Gutsy using the Update Manager, and it downloaded everything it needed, started applying the packages, and I checked on it every once in a while to make sure no messages had come up and the progress bar showed it was about halfway when I got a bunch of messages saying programs quit unexpectedly and then a message saying the update had been aborted. Now I can't get apt to show that any
[18:08] <apollo2011> more packages need to be installed, but I presume the update manager was only half done. Anyone know what the problem is or what I need to do to complete the update?

[18:10] <charles> <Foxdie>changing sources.list from fiesty to gutsy is the only way i could get the upgrade to work, still having a few problems though
[18:10] <Tomi_G> mehevi: I checked there, but hda5 is just an empty folder..
[18:11] <jnc> d90: the instructions you've found were applicable to the development phase of Gutsy, now that it is released... I don't know
[18:11] <Foxdie> I'm migrating from windows, figure that out ;)
[18:11] <Sp0tUb> jnc E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13 Permission denied)
[18:11] <Sp0tUb> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
[18:11] <bruenig> sen5421, I have been telling you that the network interface has not broken, the abstraction which launches the modules and daemons is deceiving you, it is that front end which is not succeeding, I was trying to get information as to whether or not it used the ipw3945 module along with its userspace daemon or the new firmware which doesn't require a userspace daemon and then you starting getting all whiny
[18:11] <Bax> what command do I use in the terminal to copy a directory?
[18:11] <Foxdie> Alas, no luck for me
[18:11] <IanLiu> How do I install Cinelerra??
[18:11] <zulfiqar> how do i open opt folder with root rights?
[18:11] <jnc> Sp0tUb: well, are you root?
[18:11] <saloxin> sen5421: you in a desktop? then NetworkManager and nm-applet is controlling your interfaces
[18:11] <Foxdie> Bax: cp -R
[18:11] <mehevi> Tomi_G ok unmount, then remount the drive with the correct filesystem
[18:11] <noelferreira> version 7.10 as any kind of improvment in firewall? i use to have a program p2p that worked with port forarwind that don't work anymore.
[18:11] <Foxdie> note capital R
[18:11] <vocx> bmk789, there is an Ubuntu wiki page about ndiswrapper search it.
[18:11] <charles> <d90>look up top, says upgrade available
[18:11] <Bax> ty
[18:11] <skotos> on fedora, I'd type system-config-display... what do I type to start reconfiguring X on Gibbon?
[18:11] <Sp0tUb> jnc, dont think so, how do i know?
[18:11] <Foxdie> ie. cp -R /source/folder /destination/folder
[18:11] <sen5421> saloxin, yes
[18:11] <Tomi_G> mehevi: umm, how :) ?
[18:11] <surviver> anyone know how i can fix this : i have tightvnc installed, but if someone logs in he uses the same account as me, so now i want this user to redirect to another account or wathever...
[18:12] <stefg> skotos, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[18:12] <lax> anyone know how to create a launcher on desktop to open /home?
[18:12] <Roger_The_Bum> are there any major issues with upgrading from feisty fawn?
[18:12] <zulfiqar> can i open Nautilus with root rights?
[18:12] <Dr_willis> surviver,  vnc is very very fleciable and confiurable.. make a new user, and have that user run the vncserver program is one way
[18:12] <picard_pwns_kirk> zulfiqar: yes
[18:12] <Dr_willis> surviver,  you are sharing the 'current running desktop' ? or how are you starting vnc?
[18:12] <surviver> Dr_willis, so aah i get it thx
[18:12] <apollo2011> Can I reboot safely if the update manager appears to have crashed halfway throught the upgrade procedure but apt doesn't show any packages that need to be updated?
[18:12] <jnc> zulfiqar: I don't know if there's a menu item for it, but I bet you could do gksu -c nautilus
[18:13] <surviver> Dr_willis, on boot
[18:13] <zulfiqar> jnc, thanks
[18:13] <jnc> apollo2011: yeah
[18:13] <mehevi> Tomi_G well first type 'mount' by itself and it'll tell where every device is mounted, tell me what filesystem your storage drive uses too
[18:13] <jnc> apollo2011: should be cool
[18:13] <surviver> Dr_willis, but i know what u mean thx ill fix it :))
[18:13] <Dr_willis> surviver,  you can even make vnc spawn as needed and give out a GDM/login screen with a little work.
[18:13] <Dr_willis> surviver,  but then those type of vnc sessions quit after the user log out. may not be what yiou want

[18:13] <fredl> it's a pity Ubuntu doesn't give the option to install on *multiple* logical volumes.

[18:13] <lax> no one knows how to make a home launcher
[18:14] <pwner4once> hey everyone =D
[18:14] <fredl> I mean what's the purpose of making one big logical volume?

[18:15] <vocx> sen5421, I believe it should work, but bruenig has already mentioned some interesting info. I don't know what else to suggest you.
[18:15] <d90> charles, i cant see anywhere in update manager "upgrade available"
[18:15] <sexcopter> bruenig: i've tried that, and ca (canada) is being dog slow... so perhaps i should try us...?
[18:16] <skotos> crud... it's asking how much video memory I have
[18:16] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, I mean, the package you want is named: rar and not rar-nonfree
[18:16] <Dr_willis> surviver,  i normally just have the 2nd guy ssh in, and start up vncserver manually. :) then he can start whatever vncclient he likes.
[18:16] <bruenig> sexcopter, us or any of the others, I don't know how much mirror proximity to you is important for speed, I figured they just do that to spread out the demands more evenly

[18:19] <bruenig> Sp0tUb, I don't believe there is a package called rar, there is a package called unrar which will allow extraction, but if you want rar, because it is not free, you have to get it from the rar people themselves, rarlabs or whatever it is called

[18:23] <episodic> nevermind,  I figured out I had to sudo dmidecode - one last question what do I add to    sudo dmidecode to redirect the output to a file in my home directory
[18:23] <vocx> Whamazoom, what is your real question? This is not for Mint.

[18:24] <bruenig> rtan, the name is 7.10 not 7.1, but it might be
[18:24] <Dumptruck> jnc: do you see my messages in the private messages?
[18:24] <chrisb_> saloxin: Wish that were stated somewhere - would have naturally assumed once something is indexed it's searchable.  I'll let it do its thing.  Thanks my friend.
[18:24] <Dr_willis> surviver,  a good thing to read is the actual 'vncserver' script (yes the command is just a large script that calls the real programs) it has a lot of comments.info
[18:24] <jnc> Dumptruck: no
[18:24] <rescine> Vrooom: I suggest doing it manually,   we can walk you through it, and using entire disk will erase your windows partition
[18:24] <vocx> !bot > numique
[18:24] <Vrooom> mmm  I dont want to wipe off my existing xp if i clicked on "guided - use entire disk" ?
[18:24] <Dumptruck> oh

[18:24] <Dumptruck> thanks for your help
[18:24] <Dumptruck> <Dumptruck> the other suggestion I got was with supergrub
[18:24] <Dumptruck> <Dumptruck> but that didn't seem to have anything to do with XP
[18:24] <Dumptruck> <Dumptruck> will it use graphical goodness or command line only?
[18:24] <alien18> im trying to install wxwidgets, can someone give me some help? it looks like ther are addons in synaptic, but not the full app
[18:24] <Dumptruck> jnc no

[18:24] <charles> E: ggzd: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 134, know what this means?
[18:25] <gharz> guys... my machine become so slow i wonder why. after entering username and password, it takes more than 5 minutes to show up the desktop. i'm using gutsy... i've disabled desktop effects. opening a terminal takes 1min or more... any idea?
[18:25] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, if you want to use RAR files in a transparent way,  you must install the rar package
[18:25] <Sp0tUb> AirBender # deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release Candidate amd64 (20071010)]
[18:25] <bruenig> charles, the script that runs after the files in the package have been moved into the filesystem failed
[18:25] <Vrooom> this chat app is werid.
[18:25] <preacher> anybody know why my screen goes black at login and then nothing more happens
[18:25] <trollboy_> What's the best mirror right now?
[18:25] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, sorry, I havent seen you telling me you're ready

[18:25] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, ok
[18:25] <Tomi_G> I can't see my NTFS partition when I opetn "Computer" dialog. Altough, it seems to be mounted at /media/hda5 but it is completly empty. Any ideas?
[18:25] <charles> <bruenig>how do i fix that?
[18:26] <Sp0tUb> AirBender Im not with you! :-) I have unrar-free but how to use?
[18:26] <nanbudh> i just tried to expand my c drive(XP) using gparted. but couldnot figure out any way. there is extra space i created by shrinking next partition but even then gparted does not give any option to expand c drive
[18:26] <surviver> Dr_willis, so basicly what have i to do to make another user log in on another account then mine? i have this user named "remote"
[18:26] <jnc> gharz: is everything slow, or just actions that require DNS resolution
[18:26] <generalsnus> how can i remove the window border on my terminal window..seems i only can remove menu
[18:26] <mon^rch> TY Ubuntu team for a well designed OS!!! On my way to convert yet another user :))
[18:26] <aspro> Bonjour
[18:26] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, search any line starting with the word "deb" or "deb-src" excepting the cdrom and the Backports
[18:26] <Dumptruck> jnc: where could I find the instructions on freenode?
[18:26] <gharz> jnc: everything.
[18:26] <dhamma> i need help with a (partially) successful upgrade to gutsy from fiesty...could someone have a look and advise? http://pastebin.ca/743659
[18:26] <Cusoon959> Can I see a list of recently installed packages? I installed one but I forget the name...
[18:26] <gharz> when you say DNS resolution... it deals with internet right?
[18:26] <bruenig> charles, depending on what the script was supposed to do, it may not even matter, you would want to take a look at the script, should be in /var/apt somewhere iirc, and go from there. There is no "you do this for sure" kind of answer to this, it depends on the package.
[18:26] <jnc> gharz: well, everything on a *nix box is a server
[18:26] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, then remove the #characters before the word (If ther's any # character)
[18:26] <nanbudh> any body? how do i use gparted to expand c drive containing windows?
[18:27] <Sp0tUb> AirBender Ill try
[18:27] <MrBister> Anyone running 32bit Gutsy with a SB X-Fi card?
[18:27] <gharz> jnc:  i don't get it... what do u mean everything on a *nix box is a server?
[18:27] <jnc> gharz: that's a very generic thing I'm saying, I mean for you to start a new application, there is a network socket being used, and authentication that looks up your hostname on your local network
[18:27] <hajiki> hey i upgraded to 7.10 and now i have very low sound, how can i fix that????
[18:27] <pazsion>     need some wireless truoble shooting...
[18:27] <gharz> jnc...
[18:27] <Cusoon959> Can I see a list of recently installed packages? I installed one but I forget the name...
[18:27] <bruenig> Cusoon959, I don't believe apt-get has a log so probably not, if you use cli, you can go through bash history
[18:27] <Cusoon959> ah
[18:27] <Cusoon959> ok
[18:27] <Cusoon959> thanks
[18:27] <jnc> gharz: if your DNS is messed up, terminal will take a few min to resolve the DNS before it fails and opens up
[18:27] <gharz> jnc... so u mean i there's DNS issue with my setup?
[18:27] <redeeman> hello
[18:27] <jnc> could be
[18:27] <stefg> dhamma, simply run sudo apt-get -f install, then sudo apt-get autoremove
[18:27] <taime1> how do you install compiz-fusion?
[18:27] <ompaul> !enter | Cusoon959
[18:27] <redeeman> does the ubuntu install livecd have compiz-fusion?
[18:27] <ubotu> Cusoon959: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[18:27] <gharz> jnc... how would i fix it?
[18:28] <bbrown> is anyone having any problems with with gutsy;  right now it just locked up.  I have been using it for 2 days and all it does is lockup
[18:28] <bbrown> sorry, gutsy and firefox
[18:28] <sen5421> saloxin, heh... my connection died just before I rebooted... imagine that.
[18:28] <charles> <bruenig>it is the nvidia driver for desktop effects, do you need an nvidia graphics card to run that?
[18:28] <dhamma> stefg: what will that do
[18:28] <bruenig> charles, yes
=== act1v8_ is now known as act1v8
[18:28] <pazsion> so far no problems with gutsty, del b110
[18:28] <gharz> jnc: i'm planning to delete my current gutsy and do a fresh install.
[18:28] <MrBister> Anyone running 32bit Gutsy with a SB X-Fi card?
[18:28] <vocx> dhamma, I would suggest just trying to upgrade the remaining packages until no more broken packages are detected. Clean the cache if you must.
[18:28] <AirBender> Sp0tUb, be careful with that file, remove just the "#" characters in the "deb" and "deb-src" lines
[18:28] <darkangel_> can i update my laptop with the 7.10 cd cause my laptops internet is screwery
[18:28] <m-reek> salut
[18:28] <jnc> gharz: well yeah, I could probably fix it, but it takes longer to explain everything to someone else
[18:28] <charles> <bruenig>can you still run desktop effects without it?
[18:28] <sen5421> vocx, this is hopeless for now ; I have spent a few hours looking around the forums for a solution. Time to file a bug and move to another distro.
[18:28] <Vrooom> what the difference between those option.   guided entire disk,   uses largest hdd, etc   i want the one that dont delete xp and do dual boot
[18:29] <jnc> gharz: I'm better for specific technical questions
[18:29] <nanbudh> anybody knows how to expand c drive using gparted?
=== harsh is now known as QwertyM
[18:29] <jnc> not "how do I fix it"
[18:29] <gharz> jnc... just want to know which apps should i run... i'll start from there?
[18:29] <vocx> MrBister, no luck heh? Live is hard indeed. Yep complain to the Audigy guys.
[18:29] <sen5421> bruenig, vocx, saloxin ; any tips for filing this bug?
[18:29] <Vrooom> Im not n00b though but i never installed linux co exist with xp.
[18:29] <dhamma> vocx: everything is upgraded...the 'broken' packages are from fiesty...they weren't removed
[18:29] <drama1981> can anybody help me with radeon xpress 200 on gutsy? first resolution was screwed up 832x something (cant really remember) did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. now its so huge i see nothing but the top and bottom title bars
[18:29] <stefg> dhamma, check if all dependencies are met and install missing packages, then deinstall all leftovers which were installed as dep's but are no longer  needed
[18:29] <gharz> jnc... maybe there's GUI in setting up a DNS...
[18:29] <ompaul> darkangel_, backup backup backup and try a fresh install might be a better idea - make sure you have more than one live CD handy :)
[18:29] <gharz> :(
[18:29] <saloxin> Vrooom: you have a spare pastition? "use largest" is for you.
[18:29] <pwner4once> have any heard about the slow internet speed of 7.10?
[18:30] <MrBister> vocx> roger that ;) booting back into windows now :D
[18:30] <darkangel_> ompaul so what format my laptop
[18:30] <MrBister> buy guys!
[18:30] <PanicByte> liberum, I FOUND THE SOLUTION!!!!!! Stop the VLC Shaking: Open VLC, goto Settings > Preferences > Enable Advanced Options > goto Video > Output Modules > select X11 Video Output
[18:30] <jnc> gharz: oh... you'd edit /etc/resolv.conf and see if it is correct, but that gets stuffed by DHCP client everytime you get a lease
[18:30] <pwner4once> something about DNs ?/ any know one
[18:30] <zulfiqar> can anyone tell me how to make urdu fonts under 7.10?
[18:30] <dhamma> stefg: ok cool...but just a warning to others who haven't upgraded yet and have xscreensaver password lock...turn it off or you'll be screwed big time
[18:30] <jnc> gharz: I would check /etc/hosts and be sure that it's okay
[18:30] <bruenig> sen5421, I haven't been following what they have been instructing you to do, so unless you have tried to get it going from the cli exclusively, a bug report will be useless. Also, unless other distros have their own kernel (and they don't) you won't find anything else. Kernel stuff is all the same.
[18:30] <vocx> sen5421, check if there is an existing bug. And add info there. But hey, I think lots of guys are using Intel without problems.
[18:30] <skotos> Thanks to everyone who helped me earlier. Everything seems to be running fine now!
[18:30] <Vrooom> I got spare hdd but im using that hdd partation for my backup stuff..  so.
[18:30] <drama1981> i also used the alternated cd. i dont know if this matters
[18:30] <stefg> dhamma, you can always install the ubuntu-desktop metapackage to make sure you have the correct package selection
[18:30] <gharz> jnc... currently, my network uses static ip ad.
[18:30] <Burlynn> could someone please help me with ssh from a fiesty laptop to a gutsy desktop? i try and ssh in from the laptop and it says 'RSA host key for 192.168.blah has changed and you have requested strict checking'?
[18:30] <liberum> PanicByte: Wow.. you didn't give up? I did :D I will try it out now
[18:30] <Ashfire908> after i enabled the nvidia-glx driver in 7.10, i lost some higher resoultions
[18:30] <akorn> Anybody know how to set the number of workspaces in Gutsy? I can't do it through the Workspaces switcher....
[18:30] <redeeman> does the ubuntu install livecd have compiz-fusion? and nvidia drivers?
[18:30] <jnc> gharz: ohhh... then maybe I'm on the right idea here :)
[18:31] <hajiki> hey i upgraded to 7.10 and now i have very low sound, how can i fix that????
[18:31] <sen5421> bruenig, YES... I know how to use route and IP to configure my eth0... that was the first thing I tried without anyones help.
[18:31] <bruenig> sen5421, but if you don't really care how stuff works and just want to throw stuff out there until by some miracle something happens, (a more involved derivative of click and pray), then maybe installing a different distro for this trivial of a thing would suit you
[18:31] <gharz> jnc: yes... i think u r right with that...
[18:31] <penguin42> bruenig: Most of the other distros have much heavily patched kernels than Ubuntu
[18:31] <dhamma> stefg: yeah, i might do that after i complete your other advised steop
[18:31] <dhamma> steps
[18:31] <RonLut> Hi, i have ubuntu 7.10 installed and i can't open *.aspx pages with firefox... and when it's searching for plugins it's finding nothing, help please?
[18:31] <saloxin> Burlynn: remove the entry in .ssh/known_hosts
[18:31] <bruenig> penguin42, this is a non kernel module, I should say
[18:31] <sen5421> bruenig, you think I am NEW to GNU/Linux?
[18:31] <Burlynn> saloxin, okay ill try that
[18:31] <skotos> I want to add bluetooth to my laptop. Can anyone recommend a pcmcia or usb bluetooth adapter that will work out of he box with GG?
[18:31] <jnc> hajiki: there's PCM and MASTER controls.  PCM is the level of digital sound playback
[18:31] <bruenig> sen5421, well anyone saying something as stupid as ipw3945 isn't working here, let me try another distro, one can only assume is new
[18:32] <pazsion> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[18:32] <LifeNomad> How easy is it to setup Beryl on Gusty?
[18:32] <jnc> hajiki: "alsamixer" from terminal
[18:32] <gharz> jnc: my resolv.conf says search alyaqoob513.local nameservers 4.2.2.1 nameserver 4.2.2.2 nameserver 192.168.254.254
[18:32] <enyc> LifeNomad: well they have compiz fusion
[18:32] <Heygabe> Avant's seperaters are really tall.
[18:32] <vocx> sen5421, if you are not new, then you must say so from the beginning don't you agree?
[18:32] <Ashfire908> after i enabled the restrested nvidia driver, i lost some of the higher resoultions. how do i get them back?
[18:32] <hajiki> jnc: then what?
[18:32] <jnc> gharz: is this a machine at home or at work?
[18:32] <penguin42> is there a link that is being pasted for everyone with intel-hda problems? I have it working myself but I see a lot of other people asking - is there a canned answer?
[18:32] <sen5421> bruenig, hehe... After I tried all that I have... saying that my Network connection drops RANDOMLY and cannot be brought back up is a good reason to DUMP this code.
[18:32] <gharz> jnc: home
[18:32] <RonLut> anyone?
[18:32] <jnc> oh, why static IP?
[18:32] <stefg> dhamma, and for the next time: keep alt+SysRq pressed, and press  r e i s u b in that order. that's killing the machine softly when only hard reboot seems possible
[18:33] <drama1981> anybody can help?
[18:33] <bruenig> sen5421, the code is the same on every distro though, that is why it is so silly
[18:33] <Vrooom> Is there any good guides on dual booting a ubuntu with xp?
[18:33] <gharz> jnc, i don't want to reinstall this coz i've been using this setup since 7.04
[18:33] <Tigerman> hello
[18:33] <jnc> haha
[18:33] <bruenig> sen5421, ubuntu doesn't develop ipw3945 or iwl3945
[18:33] <dhamma> stefg: ok...thanks
[18:33] <sen5421> vocx, okay, sounds like an okay rule.
[18:33] <jnc> yeah I have a box I'm updating, we'll see if that blows up
[18:33] <bruenig> or ipconfig
[18:33] <Tigerman> how can i get the DMI BIOS info?
[18:33] <racarter> what is the nmap ui package called?
[18:33] <saloxin> Tigerman: dmidecode
[18:33] <c_plus_plus> Hello, when i try to run 'compiz --replace' it gives me the error 'checking for Xgl: not present'
[18:33] <sen5421> bruenig, ipw3945 and iwl3945 are not the issue I KNOW that. I never said they were.
[18:34] <jnc> c_plus_plus: that's nice to know your Xgl is absent
[18:34] <c_plus_plus> jnc, but how do i make it work
[18:34] <quodlibetor> is there any logging i can turn on to figure out why my new 7.10 install is freezing more than once an hour?
[18:34] <racarter> nmap.. there's a gnome tool for that right?
[18:34] <RonLut> Hi, i have ubuntu 7.10 installed and i can't open *.aspx pages with firefox... and when it's searching for plugins it's finding nothing, help please?
[18:34] <bruenig> sen5421, but everything else involved in getting the network going is the same, front ends differ, but they are all using the same ifconfig iwconfig iwlist and so forth, if you can't get it going using those tools, no front end should help you
[18:34] <sen5421> bruenig, what I am saying is "This RELEASE of Ubuntu is broken" I simply installed it to default and now my connection on eth0 and eth1 are dysfunctional.
[18:34] <racarter> aspx pages render to html.. you shouldn't have to install anything
[18:34] <jnc> c_plus_plus: find a howto on enabling Xgl with Gutsy
[18:34] <Lnknpk04> I installed the restricted ATI driver because the first time i did, i didn't have any problems.  Now i cant get picture on my lcd because it says that the resolution is wrong.  how can i get into the fstab file to change it before ubuntu boots up
[18:35] <skotos> I want to add bluetooth to my laptop. Can anyone recommend a pcmcia or usb bluetooth adapter that will work out of he box with Gutsy?
[18:35] <sen5421> bruenig, also... I never said I was looking for a front end solution.
[18:35] <c_plus_plus> jnc: umm... ok
[18:35] <racarter> nmap.. has anyone ever heard of nmap?
[18:35] <jnc> Lnknpk04: fstab does not control this
[18:35] <Ashfire908> is there a way do get the xorg.conf file to be reconfigured, via a method other than editing the file directly
[18:35] <episodic> irssi is complicated how do you get a channel listing that you can use?
[18:35] <racarter> there's a gui tool for that on gnome, right?
[18:35] <RonLut> racarter but it's says "a plugin is missing" and finding nothing... and then i see empty page... (on windows it's working)
[18:35] <Lnknpk04> jnc, what does?  how could i get in there to fix the issue
[18:35] <drama1981> anybody can help me with radeon xpress 200 on gutsy?
[18:35] <sen5421> bruenig, all I want is to find WHAT CODE in "gutsy" causes this issue so I can fix it.
[18:35] <gharz> jnc: i'd greatly appreciate if you could help me fix my DNS issue.
[18:35] <jnc> episodic: uh... if you figure that one out, let me know
[18:35] <sen5421> bruenig, it seems elusive at this point
[18:35] <racarter> i dont think it has anything to do with the .aspx extension
[18:35] <racarter> it probably has a java or flash applet in it
[18:36] <saloxin> racarter: apt-cache search nmap
[18:36] <RonLut> other pages are not opening too...
[18:36] <surviver> Dr_willis, hey u maybe know if ur still here, when i use a certain app (krfb) , and run it (it works as vnc) other users and i get this "RFB 003.003", on the http://myip:port...
[18:36] <bruenig> sen5421, no but my point is that, every distro, whether they have different front ends or not, are in one way or another using those tools that you are aware of ifconfig iwconfig iwlist wpa_supplicant and so forth, if you aren't able to get it going with those on cli, then it doesn't matter where you go because everything uses those
[18:36] <jnc> gharz: privmsg is easier for me to track
[18:36] <RonLut> ok so..?
[18:36] <PanicByte> liberum, well i was having the same problem, i knew it had something to do VLC settings, cause gstreamer settings were good, and other media players were working fine
[18:36] <vocx> sen5421, head to launchpad, they have the code there for any package for any version of Ubuntu.
[18:36] <racarter> yeah i searched for nmap and i didnt see a gui tool there
[18:36] <racarter> maybe im blind ill check again
[18:36] <liberum> PanicByte: Well... it sort of worked.. but now the framerate it to slow :) i'm starting to think it's the graphics driver
[18:36] <episodic> is there a built in list of servers in irssi - if I had not of guessed to type /server irc.ubuntu.com  I would have been dead in the water

[18:37] <Tigerman> saloxin, but dmidecode only comes in the source code... how can i transform it to be installable?
[18:37] <Vrooom> F**k this this isnt clear enough.
[18:37] <Dr_willis> surviver,  pay to use vnc? NEVER heard that befor.
[18:37] <vocx> !repeat > drama1981
[18:37] <toko123> it's 68pin scsi but i'm concerned about the fiber channel
[18:37] <epidodi> I guess xchat it is then - irssi seems really hard to use
[18:37] <Tigerman> ./configure  make  make install   ???
[18:37] <Dr_willis> surviver,  its gpl'ed as far as i know.
[18:37] <bruenig> sen5421, it uses the same tools, like I am telling you, it is a front end. you can get the network going without that by cli. What I am saying is to get the network running from cli, and if you recognize the init scripts which front end for those tools are faulty in some way, then move on, but the tools themselves are the same
[18:37] <racarter> no i am blind.. it is called nmapfe
[18:37] <vocx> !anyone > drama1981
[18:37] <penguin42> Tigerman: No, it's in a package - you can just install it
[18:38] <dhamma> stefg: i tried running those commands and got the follow errors: http://www.pastebin.ca/743675
[18:38] <rescine> Vrooom: what do you need help with
[18:38] <[chr0n0s]> anyone who got gutsy working (just base, not compiz) on ATi, mine window redraw is slow
[18:38] <surviver> Dr_willis, i try to find the link back..
[18:38] <saloxin> Tigerman: hm? dmidecode gives you all the bios info on stdout?
[18:38] <racarter> the nmapfe has a weird icon...
[18:38] <h|barbobot> is there a way to start compiz from the start in kubuntu?
[18:38] <Tigerman> saloxin, what is stdout?
[18:38] <Vrooom> Install ubuntu on xp hdd as dual boot.
[18:38] <RonLut> here is a page i can';t see for example: http://www.keshet-tv.com/NightClub/lobbyvideo.aspx
[18:38] <saloxin> Tigerman: printed out nicely in your terminal

[18:38] <Vrooom> Yeah
[18:39] <h|barbobot> ethereal/wireshark racarter
[18:39] <MerlinsLair> I'm running one on my setup but wanted to check on any issues before upgrading
[18:39] <skotos> I want to add bluetooth to my laptop. Can anyone recommend a pcmcia or usb bluetooth adapter that will work out of he box with Gutsy Gibbon?
[18:39] <saloxin> racarter: tcpdump | wireshark
[18:39] <[chr0n0s]> MerlinsLair, try live CD
[18:39] <drama1981> im having problems with radeon xpress 200 on gutsy. first the resolution wa sway out of wack 834x something (can remember exactly) so i did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. now my resoulution is even worse. its so big all i see is the top and bottom title bars (takes my whole screen)
[18:39] <neighborlee> what again is the command to find out what header is in what package for apps that you dont have installed yet ?
[18:39] <Vrooom> Partation #1 (sda) and use freed space
[18:39] <surviver> Dr_willis, found it on forum to, but cant find back anymore, but i got this, http://www.realvnc.com/products/download.html
[18:39] <Vrooom> i selected that...
[18:39] <Niklas_E> is there any way to fix a partition if ubuntu 7.10 has ruined the partitons when you tried to install it?
[18:39] <MerlinsLair> gotcha chr0n0s...will do that
[18:39] <penguin42> neighborlee: apt-file search
[18:39] <quodlibetor> can anybody help me figure out why my gutsy is freezing every hour?
[18:39] <neighborlee> penguin42: isn't that only for installed apps ?
[18:40] <MerlinsLair> Feisty is working too well for me to screw it up
[18:40] <saloxin> Niklas_E: ouch. not really. which way is it messed up?
[18:40] <penguin42> neighborlee: No, apt-file is great
[18:40] <stefg> dhamma, try sudo dpkg --configure -a . A reboot might also fix that problem. reinstall ubuntu-desktop afterwards (sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop)
[18:40] <neighborlee> ok thx
[18:40] <MTecknology> penguin42, any ideas?
[18:40] <racarter> i remember ethereal.. what is wireshark.. does it have a ui?
[18:40] <racarter> or is it a terminal program only?
[18:40] <penguin42> MTecknology: Sorry, I missed your reply?
[18:40] <Veinor> racarter: wireshark has a GUI

[18:42] <Zippy2> bert__: you can use that port scanner on grc.com
[18:42] <jewbilee> blitz: have you tried manually changing it from the display preferences section?
[18:43] <Zippy2> shields up i think it's called
[18:43] <[chr0n0s]> anyone who got gutsy working (just base, not compiz) on ATi, mine window redrawing is slow
[18:43] <MTecknology> there's NOTHING in /media/windows except for RECYCLER and System Volume Information
[18:43] <Niklas_E> saloxin: tried that, and had to get anther harddisk and installed ubuntu un that and still can't exec the 2 harddisks
[18:43] <saloxin> _blitz_: use the little knobs at the bottom of the monitor ;-)
[18:43] <liberum> PanicByte: The same.. but Totem does not lag frames... but it DO play all my videos in inverted colors (or something :D)
[18:43] <MTecknology> vocx, i'm in the process of fixing crap
[18:43] <_blitz_> there is only one refresh rate available
[18:43] <drama1981> i also get vga not support h49 v89 at boot. as well as the resolution problem with readeon xpress 200 on gutsy
[18:43] <saloxin> Niklas_E: what do you mean by exec a hd?
[18:43] <saloxin> Niklas_E: not mountable?
[18:43] <skotos> how can I find out if I have a bluetooth module in my laptop?
[18:43] <PanicByte> liberum, hey, try OpenGL video output instead of X11 video output
[18:43] <rescine> Vrooom: can you give me the layout of your hdd. Does the installer show that?
[18:43] <PanicByte> liberum, that might be better
[18:43] <godzirra> heya folks.  I installed gutsy on my laptop, but every once in a while, it just kind of... stops working.  The networking gets disconnected, and when I login to a console window, I can't run -any- commands at all.
[18:44] <godzirra> Any ideas?
[18:44] <Niklas_E> saloxin: not mountable, and not do in with fdisk to change partitions
[18:44] <Pir8> http://www.puleen.com/archives/120 <--- look at the second picture I posted :)

[18:44] <saloxin> Niklas_E: the live cd should have gparted in the amdinistration menu. any luck there?
[18:44] <aata> anyone? loss of wlan is killing me right now!
[18:44] <rescine> !paste
[18:44] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[18:44] <drama1981> i did a fresh install using the alternate cd if that makes a difference
[18:44] <liberum> PanicByte: Already tried them all :) All are the same, but standard (standard is worse)
[18:45] <saloxin> _blitz_: are you using different resolutions in win/lin?
[18:45] <Niklas_E> saloxin: hmm, gparted haven't tried that
[18:45] <Vrooom> Screenshot.png
[18:45] <TwoD> Oh, btw, which command-line irc clients do you recommend?
[18:45] <_blitz_> saloxin may i pm u?
[18:45] <godzirra> TwoD: irssi
[18:45] <_blitz_> same resolutions

[18:45] <mirak> hi
[18:46] <godzirra> TwoD: if you don't like irssi, there's bitchx, but I personally like irssi much better.
[18:46] <saloxin> TwoD: irssi!

[18:46] <mirak> ubuntu upgrade from feisty to gutsy fails
[18:46] <nik> hello people
[18:46] <mirak> the language pack for french is corrupted or something like that
[18:46] <LifeNomad> yea my Xubuntu update crashed the system
[18:46] <nekr0z> hi all! I installed amarok over ubuntu, it works, but the menu font is very big. any way to change it?
[18:46] <godzirra> mirak: thats why when I partition my drive, I have a seperate partition for /home, so I can just completely reinstall my laptop when a new version comes out.
[18:46] <TwoD> I've seen friends use irssi and it does seem cool, I guess it's the way to go then =)
[18:46] <rescine> Vrooom: sorry. im new to irc....how do i access the image
[18:46] <Tomi_G> I can't mount my NTFS partition on Gutsy
[18:46] <godzirra> nekr0z: fresh install?
[18:46] <nekr0z> godzirra: yep
[18:47] <[chr0n0s]> rescine, what image ?
[18:47] <warlock> ?
[18:47] <godzirra> Huh.  Thats odd.  Gutsy?  I installed amarok and it worked fine for me.
[18:47] <MerlinsLair> think I'll hold off on an upgrade for a while
[18:47] <ckw> [chr0n0s]:I have it running here on an ATI AIW 9600
[18:47] <lucaferr> is bytecode interpreter enabled in freetype that comes with ubuntu 7.10?
[18:47] <Jaymac> upgraded to gutsy... is there any way to easily update my nvidia graphics driver to the new one so that i don't get the black screen bug? is envy the best solution?
[18:47] <mirak> godzirra: I don't want to reinstall. my /home is separated too
[18:47] <[chr0n0s]> ckw, which drivers?
[18:47] <godzirra> mirak: I'm not sure about why it would fail though, since I haven't tried it.
[18:47] <[chr0n0s]> Jaymac, i think envy is more problem then a solution
[18:47] <riotkittie> mirak: how far into the upgrade did you get? did it start at all?
[18:47] <nik> does anyone have experience with wireless in ubuntu ??
[18:47] <nekr0z> godzirra: yes. it works. I only want to make the mune font smaller
[18:47] <[chr0n0s]> !envy | Jaymac
[18:47] <ubotu> Jaymac: envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[18:47] <nik> wireless is a bitch
[18:47] <ckw> [chr0n0s]:I got the latest linux drivers from the ATI/AMD site
[18:47] <Tomi_G> I can't mount my NTFS partition on Gutsy :((((((
[18:47] <kotau> hey guys where is the startup list for xfce4?  I've checked ~/.config/autostart but that's not it, I have three instances of a program running at start and wanna pare it down to one
[18:47] <riotkittie> nik: what are your issues with wireless?
[18:48] <godzirra> nekr0z: Right, I'm saying I don't know why the menu font is weird, since it worked fine for me. :/
[18:48] <nik> hello riotkittie
[18:48] <Jaymac> [chr0n0s], then how do i tell restricted-manager to upgrade my nvidia drivers?
[18:48] <nik> ty
[18:48] <[chr0n0s]> ckw, does the --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy option works with the binary ?
[18:48] <andrewss> Hi, I have a problem resuming from hibernate on a dmcrypted disk after installing 7.10. any ideeas on how to debug this?
[18:48] <nik> one thing I have a new laptop
[18:48] <godzirra> Jaymac: Are you using feisty or gutsy?
[18:48] <nik> hp dv 6500
[18:48] <mirak> riotkittie: no it fails the first prerequesite, on all mirrors I tried. I am not the only one to have this problem
[18:48] <godzirra> Feisty for some reason didn't detect my nvidia card.  Gutsy did.
[18:48] <nik> with some freakin card
[18:48] <Jaymac> godzirra, just upgraded to gutsy
[18:48] <ckw> [chr0n0s]:that i cannot answer
[18:48] <nik> that has no XP drivers
[18:48] <nekr0z> godzirra: the thing is, i made all fonts in GNOME 8, not 10. and it stays 10 in amarok
[18:48] <godzirra> nekr0z: ahh.. not sure about that.  Sorry mate.
[18:48] <mirak> riotkittie: that's a huge use case failure
[18:48] <[chr0n0s]> Jaymac, sorrry boss, no idea
[18:48] <Jaymac> still got the 9639 driver
[18:49] <skotos> how can I find out if I have a bluetooth module in my laptop? What does the dev name look like?
[18:49] <vocx> !enter > nik
[18:49] <[chr0n0s]> ckw, try it out if you still have the drivers saved somewhere
[18:49] <godzirra> Jaymac: I think if you want to use the restricted drivers, you just upgrade the restricted drivers package.
[18:49] <pike_> skotos: lspci -v might give you an idea
[18:49] <aata> ideas, anyone???
[18:49] <Dicey> I'm trying to install Gutsy iso, but gparted isn't working correctly. I want to try the gparted and partition magic live cds. Do I burn them to cds just like the ubuntu iso?
[18:49] <penguin42> nekr0z: Try running the KDE control centre and changing fonts there; it's called kcontrol - I'm not sure if that'll help, but amarok is more KDE than Gnome
[18:49] <ckw> [chr0n0s]:however even after the newest driver I am unable to extend my desktop to the second monitor
[18:49] <godzirra> That may not get you the most up to date nvidia driver, but if you want the most up to date, you'll need to use the nvidia script from their site, or the envy script or something.
[18:49] <Jaymac> godzirra, i think i have upgraded
[18:49] <pike_> Dicey: yes
[18:49] <andrewss> anyone here using 7.10 with dmcrypt ?
[18:49] <squidgy> Hi. Ever since upgrading, "/usr/bin/X :0 -br -audit 0 -auth /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth -nolisten tcp vt7" is eating half of my processor constantly.  Ideas on a fix?
[18:49] <godzirra> Jaymac: then thats the most up to date driver in the restricted drivers package.
[18:49] <Dicey> thanks
[18:49] <tuku> Hi...I have gutsy installed on extranal hd and windows xp on laptop(work machine) hd. Is there any way to start that existing windows by virtualization from ubuntu?
[18:50] <godzirra> Jaymac: if you want newer than that, you'll have to install via the nvidia/envy script.
[18:50] <Jaymac> godzirra, ok thanks
[18:50] <vocx> aata, please repeat your question, otherwise just asking "anyone" becomes annoying. But be patient.
[18:50] <Niklas_E> need to reboot and check gparted, bbl
[18:50] <Skwerl> My Gutsy CD-ROM (created by Nero via ISO) won't boot, and won't mount in Feisty, but my Windows machine detects it just fine. And the CD-ROM drive on the Feisty box works with other CD's
[18:50] <Jaymac> godzirra, i thought they'd updated to solve the black screen bug
[18:50] <[chr0n0s]> ckw : i am still struggling for the first monitor :(
[18:50] <pike_> Dicey: remember you need livecd if youre trying to resize usually as you cant resize a partition you have mounted
[18:50] <liberum> PanicByte: I also tried renaming ~/.vlc and completely removing VLC, then install it again
[18:50] <Sick_Fish> Guys, I just installed linux ubuntu on my old me 2000 computer and I need some navigation help
[18:50] <godzirra> Jaymac: Which card you have?  I had that problem with the install on feisty, but on gutsy it detected my card and used the nvidia driver no problem
[18:50] <racarter> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3581550#post3581550
[18:50] <nik> well here is the problem , I have a new lappy ... I did some looking around and this is my 03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 02)
[18:50] <liberum> Sick_Fish: what are you looking for?
[18:50] <nekr0z> penguin42: yeah, it would. but i don't feel like installing kcontrol for this. maybe someone knows the way to do it via editing config files?
[18:50] <pike_> Sick_Fish: ?
[18:50] <riotkittie> mirak:  if you havent already done so, check your sources.lst - upgrade is failing for some people, but leaving their sources changed to the gutsy repos, rather than feisty or whatever they are using. which could be ugly.
[18:50] <danny3793> I have an issue now after trying to upgrade to Gutsy from Feisty, I don't know what to do can someone help?
[18:50] <Dicey> ??? What do you mean?
[18:50] <Sick_Fish> first question: how do I get to the cube thing?
[18:51] <LifeNomad> Sick_Fish: What navigation?
[18:51] <ckw> [chr0n0s]:I was on here late last night(actually early this morning) trying to find someone who has had success
[18:51] <tharis20> hey
[18:51] <godzirra> Sick_Fish: thats compiz or beryl.
[18:51] <stefg> tuku, possible but dangerous. Requires a separate hardware profile for the virtual hardware, and might blow the setup if you change the wrong one when running native
[18:51] <Dicey> I was going to do a live cd
[18:51] <tharis20> how can i remove something
[18:51] <LifeNomad> Sick_Fish: Beryl, or Compiz Fusion
[18:51] <Jaymac> godzirra, geforce go 7400
[18:51] <godzirra> Beryl is deprecated, so I'd go with compiz.
[18:51] <Sick_Fish> how do I get that?
[18:51] <godzirra> compiz fusion rather.
[18:51] <IanLiu> I am trying to edit a file with 'sudo gedit', but it says I must have ROOT access.. How do I get it??
[18:51] <godzirra> Sick_Fish: google for ubuntu and compiz fusion
[18:51] <pike_> tharis20: in your synaptic package manager just unclick it and hit apply
[18:51] <Jaymac> godzirra, the black screen bug is only a problem running compiz
[18:51] <Sick_Fish> compiz is better?
[18:51] <godzirra> Jaymac: huh.. what is the problem exactly?
[18:51] <Vrooom> rescine   http://www.vrooom.copperstream.co.uk/t1.png
[18:51] <Grenadier> IanLiu: sudo gives you root access
[18:51] <vocx> !beryl > Sick_Fish
[18:51] <rescine> so, but gparted isn't working correctly. I want to try the gparted and partition magic
[18:51] <rescine>           live cds. Do I burn them to cds just like the ubuntu iso?
[18:52] <godzirra> Sick_Fish: its not necessarily better per se, but its still actively maintained, where as beryl is not.
[18:52] <LifeNomad> Sick_Fish: its the same I believe, look in synaptic for the packages
[18:52] <IanLiu> But I cant edit the file with sudo...
[18:52] <ckw> [chr0n0s]:What is the --buildpkg option and why would I want to use it?
[18:52] <Jaymac> godzirra, with the nvidia driver, when i have too many windows open the graphics card runs out of memory and the windows are black
[18:52] <pike_> rescine: yes
[18:52] <simplyubuntu> is anyone using broadcom with gutsy?
[18:52] <riotkittie> IanLiu: try  gksu gedit   or gksudo  gedit
[18:52] <godzirra> Meaning that Compiz Fusion will get better, and Beryl will not.
[18:52] <Jaymac> they released an update that fixes it
[18:52] <godzirra> simplyubuntu: yeah. Mine just worked.
[18:52] <IanLiu> ok
[18:52] <vocx> !anyone > simplyubuntu
[18:52] <godzirra> Jaymac: Huh.  I remember reading about that but haven't ran into it, unfortunately. :/
[18:52] <simplyubuntu> can you tell me how, godzirra
[18:52] <godzirra> well, good for me, unfortunately for you I suppose. :)
[18:52] <NemesisD> saloxin, you still there?

[18:53] <drama1981> well im out maybe ill come back later and attempt to fix my prob, laterz
[18:53] <danny3793> How do I continue the upgrade from Feisty to Gutsy, my upgrade failed, I can't mount my external HDD to backup my data and do a complete reinstall, I don't care about the programs currently installed as I can get them back after I get Gutsy installed

[18:53] <Sick_Fish> the bot is telling me not to get beryl
[18:53] <simplyubuntu> i see.. i enabled the restricted driver, but no interface such as wlan0 even exists....
[18:53] <bmk789> is there a separate room for amd64?
[18:53] <riotkittie> Jaymac: the nvidia issue. :|
[18:53] <NemesisD> saloxin, ive been told to avoid this problem in the future to put /home on a separate partition, i have a 40gb drive in the machine, im giving 1gb to swap, how should i partition the rest?
[18:53] <riotkittie> bmk789: no
[18:53] <pike_> Sick_Fish: no compiz included in gutsy is what you want
[18:53] <godzirra> bmk789: not that I know of.

[18:53] <gumpish_> Is there an apt-spy for ubuntu repos??
[18:53] <Grenadier> After I installed it, gnome-themes, and consequently gnome-accessibility-themes and ubuntu-desktop failed to install...and thus, it won't boot

[19:09] <Grenadier> Someone please help me, my installation is completely broken

[19:09] <Creepindacellar> >	hello, i have just downloaded and installed libraries and updates, now my sound quit working. any ideas?
[19:09] <hmuller> OpenGuru:  Tried that, font color not an option.
[19:09] <Tigerman> look at this output from dmidecode:  # dmidecode 2.9
[19:09] <Tigerman> # No SMBIOS nor DMI entry point found, sorry.

[19:09] <hccmb> is there an workaround the big fonts in virtual box?
[19:09] <nivekc1>  i have my PC (ubuntu 7.10) hooked up to my dell w3707c LCDTV via VGA cable im not sure how i got it working but when i go into screens to save the config so i can do it again there isnt  anything there and when i try to select something and make it work it is always out of range yet somehow is working with no settings, i dont want to turn it off for fear i wont be able to get it working on here again any one good at this? my tv says i nee
[19:09] <danny3793> Lmao, this is awesome, I press Alt-F2 and nothing happens.
[19:09] <hccmb> is there an workaround the big fonts in virtual box?
[19:09] <zap0> helo_moto, stop being abstract.
[19:09] <hmuller> No prob
[19:10] <lavender_dream> lixoman100: that is beyond my scope but on a personal experience, I did have problem getting my resolution and refresh rate to work properly after I upgraded my video card driver from restricted driver manager, had to search around and found that I had to add "Option	"DynamicTwinView" "False" in my monitor section of xorg.conf
[19:10] <rescine> Grenadier: how you mean completely broken
[19:10] <OpenGuru> hmuller: did u try gconf-editor ?
[19:10] <unhu> I need help upgrading from 5.10 to 6.06
[19:10] <Grenadier> rescine: After upgrading to Gutsy, gnome-themes refuses to upgrade
[19:10] <pheld> danny3793: i have the same prob on one machine, and have been able to make it work reasonably well with lots of manual work (re-create incomplete initrd's) but there is no clear description of the upgrade process that can be used to perform the missing bits manually. First check it you can at least boot the old kernel in recovery-mode.
[19:10] <lavender_dream> lixoman100: after that everything worked
[19:10] <OpenGuru> hmuller: most of the gnome setting can be changed there
[19:10] <Grenadier> It cites libgdk-pixbuf missing a symbol called g_once_enter_init_impl

[19:11] <scguy318> danny3793: you can kindly access data from a LiveCD and backup
[19:11] <scguy318> danny3793: Rescubuntu, or a plain LiveCD will do
[19:11] <xonicx> hi! i was installing gutsy from dvd but installer could not read some file from disk and aborted. since it had resized/created partition and grub was not installed so i was not able to boot even in windows. Later i choose to choose to install "command line system" from boot menu which worked fine and grub got installed. Now i want to upgrade to full distribution. How should i do it?
[19:11] <TwoD> How do I reset Gnome's config files and backup my current ones?
[19:11] <hmuller> Someone else said "themes" so it may not be as simple as I had hoped.
[19:11] <danny3793> scguy318: I have a 6.06 Ubuntu LiveCD but thats about it =\
[19:11] <scguy318> danny3793: that should do

[19:12] <unhu> scguy318 no, the upgrade does not appear there
[19:12] <nrp> anabelle, i think its Scale

[19:19] <bananamuzzj> Can i use the  fglrx 8.41 drive on an radeon 9600?
[19:19] <riotkittie> IHK: there is no root pass, as root is locked.

[19:19] <lixoman100> riotkittie: Yes, I've tried everything I can think of. Actually I even loaded my monitor's .inf, horizsync and vertrefresh are correct, the only modeline I have there s 1680x1050 (i deleted all others), same thing for "modes" on screen, but it seems to be ignoring my xorg.conf and only accepting what ddcprobe returns :/

[19:20] <undergroundman> I don't know what you guys are talking about
[19:20] <scguy318> undergroundman: I think your card is a Broadcom, though I think Gutsy has restricted firmware for your thing, though I could be dead wrong
[19:20] <gharz> i think it was the DNS... everything i guess was messed up.
[19:20] <pike_> TwoD: in your home dir. open a term  and type 'ls -l' then you can rm em by rm -r .gonf or whatever
[19:20] <Tigerman> saloxin, still no hibernate & suspend
[19:20] <scguy318> undergroundman: System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager yield anything?

[19:20] <gharz> jnc: i'm very glad... thank you for the help!!!!
[19:21] <lixoman100> riotkittie: ddcprobe seems to be broken here, it reports my maximum resolution as 1280x1040, and any resolution above that (when I manage to get it working) ends up with a bigger restolution inside 1280x1024, allowing me to scroll around. And yes, I have restarted X and the whole computer several times

[19:22] <ubotu> Creepindacellar: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
[19:22] <jinxed> I upgraded to Gutsy today using the Update Manager. The upgrade seemed to go fine until the end. Right at the end of the upgrade, when cleanup was being done, I got a few errors... which I failed to record. Now when I boot, I get the login screen and after logging in, I get two error messages: 1. Nautilus can't be used now due to an unexpected error from Bonobo when attempting to register...
[19:22] <jinxed> ...the file manager view server. 2. The panel has encountered a fatal error. The panel could not register with the bonobo-activation server (Error code: 3) and will exit. It may be automatically restarted.
[19:22] <pike_> arang2: well some distros use xfs but id not unless i had bat backup
[19:22] <MFen> just upgraded to Gutsy -- the Appearance Preferences dialog doesn't work right. when i pick Normal, Extra or whatever it redraws the screen, becomes completely disabled, then about 10 seconds later it comes back, still set to None.  my educated guess is that it's trying to ask me if i want to keep these settings, and the dialog for that isn't displaying correctly (but everything else is)
[19:22] <MFen> is this a known problem?
[19:22] <scguy318> undergroundman: I suppose you can install now, then you can use a guide that I will link you to for ndiswrapper
[19:22] <JymmmEMC> In menu.list what is this UUID I see on some entries?
[19:22] <MFen> compiz worked for me when i installed it manually in feisty, so i know it's not just a hardware failure
[19:22] <scguy318> undergroundman: Gutsy or Feisty?
[19:22] <pike_> !uuid | JymmmEMC
[19:22] <ubotu> JymmmEMC: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell: « sudo blkid » (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)

[19:23] <riotkittie> MFen: what gfx card are you using?
[19:23] <pike_> arang2: yes i believe so
[19:23] <scguy318> arang2: yes
[19:23] <Tigerman> saloxin, maybe the Linux kernel doesn't support my mobo to get the DMI BIOS year out of it... my mobo is from the year 2001, so if DMI BIOS year would be 2001, ACPI would be enabled (because it's a post-2000 mobo)   right?
[19:23] <padee> hello. does anyone have experience with upgrading ubuntu from 6.06 to the newest version
[19:23] <scguy318> arang2: I'm not sure if ntfs-3g handles the journal, I think it does
[19:23] <arang2> pike_: then why the speed difference? cos i know u can disable journalling but in that case i'd run XFS then

[19:25] <insllvn> *is there a way
[19:25] <saloxin> a lot of acpi implementations are just broken. you might fix it by bios upgrade or hack away at your kernel dsdt tables. or do like me, ignore it untill next ubuntu release
[19:25] <hmuller> Any gnome-panel font color changers in here?
[19:25] <JymmmEMC> Surb: yes
[19:25] <pike_> JymmmEMC: basically if you move stuff around and hda1 is no longer hda1 everything will still work. i personally dont like it but for average config i guess its a good idea
[19:25] <Garoth> And any attempt to make it generic will create a completely black screen until reboot
[19:25] <MFen> riotkittie: is that blacklist maintained by compiz or by ubuntu?
[19:25] <arang2> pike_: ok, so ext3 it is? anything that could be done to speed it up without sacrificing it's integrity?
[19:25] <Pacane> Can someone tell where I can get some documentation about customizing my taskbars?

[19:26] <insllvn> Creepindacellar, it is in Synaptic
[19:26] <pike_> arang2: maybe make /tmp xfs but i dont know that would make much diff and youd need to be sure to allocate enough space for it

[19:26] <Surb> rescine, 'kay.

[19:28] <pike_> arang2: modern flash has pretty high write numbers and it is pretty cheap but yeah
[19:28] <Tigerman> saloxin, maybe the Linux kernel doesn't support my mobo to get the DMI BIOS year out of it... my mobo is from the year 2001, so if DMI BIOS year would be 2001, ACPI would be enabled by default (because it's a post-2000 mobo)   but Linux kernel doesn't seem to support the BIOS of my mobo so it can't retrieve (get) the info on DMI BIOS year of my mobo, hence it doesn't enable ACPI            right????
[19:28] <riotkittie> MFen: did you say it was a 965?
[19:29] <bo2> errm

[19:37] <jinxed> garoth: you might want to give that a try FIRST... then use the restricted driver manager if Envy fails... ;)
[19:37] <scguy318> Garoth: make sure to backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf beforehand of course
[19:38] <saloxin> Tigerman: nope.
[19:38] <mile92> i tried both the alternate and the default one, it's weird though, ubuntu 70.4 worked fine, but gutsy doesn't
[19:38] <csc`> penguin42: ok so ive got a gutsy(?) livecd/install cd here?
=== Whisper is now known as Norehsa
[19:38] <BlackShuck2> Does 7.10 seem to be incredibly broken for PowerPC/PS3?
[19:38] <Garoth> scguy318: the resolution app can't do anything that xrandr can't
[19:38] <murlidhar> Can anybody explain me what was that? that huge flood of DCC and CTCP
[19:38] <Tigerman> saloxin, do i really need to update my BIOS? flashing the BIOS wouldn't do the trick?
[19:38] <penguin42> csc': If you have a gutsy cd you either have a livecd/install cd or an 'alternate' cd that is for installing more fussy machines
[19:38] <BlackShuck2> When the GUI installer starts, the screen resolution is too low for the size of the dialogs :-(
[19:38] <Norehsa> Hello, has anybody had any luck installing 7.10 on PPC? (more specifically an iBook G4?)
[19:38] <ilug1> l
[19:39] <dhamma> no one here knows how to install from source?
[19:39] <csc`> penguin42: its a 7.10 cd i downloaded a few days ago
[19:39] <scguy318> !make | dhamma
[19:39] <ubotu> dhamma: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first: not all !repositories are enabled by default!)
[19:39] <jrib> murlidhar: just some script kiddies, ignore it
[19:39] <riotkittie> murlidhar: that was some lonely script kiddie and his botnet.
[19:39] <penguin42> csc': OK, it's probably the live/install then
[19:39] <saloxin> Tigerman: updating the bios is also a shot in the dark. seems like your mobo sin't properly supported. end of story
[19:39] <lixoman100> Hello, I need help configure my resolution. I have a LCD monitor (LG L203WT) connected via DVI to my video card (GeForce 8800GTX. Its native resoution is 1680x1050, but I can't set that resolution; the highest I can go is 1280x1024. I have tried adding modelines to xorg.conf and my HorizSync and VertRefresh are correct. ddcprobe reports my highest resolution as being 1280x1024, and it also says "edid: edidfail" at the end.
[19:39] <Zackery999> Where is a link to how to install without a CD
[19:39] <dhamma> ubotu: ok, i'll check it out

[19:40] <Tigerman> anyone knows where to get the proper NVIDIA nForce2 Ultra 400 + MCP  BIOS update????
[19:40] <Zippy2> i was using 6.10 at work and skipped over feisty, confused the two :)
[19:40] <scguy318> Garoth: mm, try manually tweaking xorg.conf?
[19:40] <picard_pwns_kirk> Aep-: startx
[19:40] <Aep-> Because the manual says I get a screen and such
[19:40] <Garoth> scguy318: how?
[19:40] <Tigerman> anyone knows where to get the proper NVIDIA nForce2 Ultra 400 + MCP  BIOS update????
[19:40] <alecwh> I just installed phpmyadmin on my new gusty OS, but I don't see it when I type 'localhost' in my browser. Can someone help me?
[19:40] <riotkittie> murlidhar: nothing to worry about unless you were disconnected at some point during the madness, in which case you should do something to your router

[19:41] <Garoth> scguy318: I have been trying... but to no avail.
[19:41] <blizzkid> hi people, nothing to do with Ubuntu as such, but I have a question about smtp. When I send an email from evolution to gmail, the headers show "Received-SPF: softfail (google.com: domain of transitioning xxx@xxx.xxx does not designate xxx.xxx.xxx.xx as permitted sender)" Is this due to relaying, and what can I do about it, as some domains refuse my mails
[19:41] <aantn> is it possible to uninstall software on another partition?
[19:41] <Aep-> picard_pwns_kirk: It says unrecognised command
[19:41] <scguy318> Garoth: i think you'll want to add another Screen section
[19:41] <scguy318> Garoth: other than that, I am empty :(
[19:41] <Aep-> The command I think I should use is kernel, but I dont know what to put after kernel
[19:41] <Aep-> kernel / doesnt work
[19:41] <Garoth> scguy318: Yeah.... a sceen, a monitor, and a device, then set it to use that in layout?
[19:41] <picard_pwns_kirk> Aep-: might be because your displays were misconfigured
[19:41] <scguy318> Garoth: yeah I suppose
[19:41] <stimpy77> hi guys I need help with hopefully a simple problem.

[19:42] <alecwh>  I just installed phpmyadmin on my new gusty OS, but I don't see it when I type 'localhost' in my browser. Can someone help me?
[19:42] <PriceChild> ATTENTION - I am about to set some banforwards on channel users who are susceptible to a router exploit in order to help them fix it. I will be kick/forwarding in groups of 4 or 5
[19:42] <doofy`> whats the command to run the xserver reconfigure again?
[19:42] <picard_pwns_kirk> Aep-: I solved it by using system rescue cd
[19:42] <blizzkid> thx saloxin, I'll have a look there
[19:42] <Aep-> Its a very old computer, and I just want all partitions to be deleted, thats why I have Gparted
[19:42] <jnc> alecwh: it's not on port 80
[19:42] <murlidhar> riotkittie:  no i didn't disconnect but was worried if i was the only one was experienced it .
[19:42] <scguy318> Garoth: I guess that
[19:42] <jnc> alecwh: I don't know what the port is for it, but you'd need to say which port localhost:n where n is the port
[19:42] <alecwh> jnc: Nevermind, I got it.
[19:42] <gaijin> hello everybody (good evening)
[19:42] <Garoth> scguy318: actually, maybe I will try that again. In the past, it's just blacked both my screens. Maybe I was doing it wrong, looking at it again

[19:43] <stimpy77> I finally got audio working in my aspire 5050 laptop by going into alsamixer and unmuting surround. Now, however, I'm trying to figure out how to enable audio capture. The alsamixer DOES "hear" the mic as it will do an audible feedback loop.
[19:43] <scguy318> Garoth: g/l, wish I knew more
[19:43] <Garoth> scguy318: well, if not, then I'll try envy

[19:44] <Darius2> Hello, I am having trouble install Gutsy on a Compaq Presario 730US laptop. The CD boots but right after it loads the GNOME display manager, it freezes. I have also tried safe graphics mode with no success. Anyone know what's going on?
[19:44] <iStiKs> dhamma: read the readme file
[19:45] <Pacane> Does anyone know where I can get documentation about customizing the taskbars ?
[19:45] <astronouth7303> on gutsy, Xorg uses h/v sync rates slightly different from what windows would use (both report 1680x1050@60Hz) and my monitor displays the picture as 4:3 instead of 8:5. Feisty had the same problem, but I could work around it by setting the resolution to 1600x1200 and then back to 1680x1050; this hack no longer works in gutsy. This is using the intel driver on a Intel 80G965 chip.
[19:45] <scguy318> i'm going to go upgrade now, brb
[19:45] <picard_pwns_kirk> Darius2: how much ram do you have?

[19:47] <mile92> help... i'm having problems installing ubuntu on my laptop(hp pavilion)
[19:47] <mile92> feisty installed fine, but gusty doesn't want to boot(not even the live cd), it just gets stuck
[19:47] <mile92> i've tried both the standard and the alternate cd, same thing(they get stuck at reading the cd)
[19:47] <mile92> a more exotic way i tried is http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows#head-78c19b6681c16d2dc3f82baeddf3a8465d39a0bd
[19:47] <mile92>   - i got farther than the booting with the cd, but i got stuck during the instalation(something like reading xbs)
[19:47] <jrib> mile92: try to keep what you say on a single line, or else the channel becomes too busy

[19:48] <picard_pwns_kirk> no problem
[19:48] <jrib> crshman: they are whatever you want them to be.  What filesystem?
[19:48] <KnightCPT> Does anyone know if the restricted ATI drivers (on Gutsy) will work with Compiz? I can't seem to get it to work, so I assume not...
[19:48] <Riyonuk> I cant create partitions
[19:48] <blizzkid> saloxin, so if understand correctly, I should somehow tell my DNS that my smtp-server is allowed to send mails on behalf of my domain?

[19:48] <fisher> pls  can someone tell me were is this stie?
[19:49] <ConstyXIV> does xgl do anything special at all?

[19:49] <Robstafarian> I'm trying to add Ubuntu 7.10 to my existing GRUB list, what are the default post-install kernel arguments?

[19:49] <Clinton__> matthew_: make sure it's plugged in
[19:49] <jrib> crshman: which filesystem?
[19:49] <crshman> jrib: xfs
[19:50] <crdlb> ConstyXIV, Xgl is essentially an abstraction layer that makes compiz work on using only 3d acceleration (no special driver features needed)
[19:50] <matthew_> Clinton__:  it's attached to the frame of my computer ;)
[19:50] <f0rgeIf`> How do I change the permission of a file from root to user?
[19:50] <astronouth7303> lixoman100: on gutsy, you can open the config and add the .inf driver file
[19:50] <jdong> f0rgeIf`: chown user:user file
[19:50] <crshman> jrib: i want to be able to let my user (aKa non-root) read/write/delete files from the drive
[19:50] <todkon> hmm, last night I just installed Ubuntu Gusty, and now my sound doesn't work.... I have an Audigy Sound Blaster card. The sound card is recognized by the computer, but no output whatsoever. Does anyone possibly know how to resolve this problem? I checked out the forums and wiki, but haven't found anything to work :(
[19:50] <jdong> f0rgeIf`: but first make sure that's the right thing to be doing
[19:50] <lixoman100> astronouth7303: I did that, and the HorizSync and VertRefresh were set correctly, but I still can't setup the resolution to 1680x1050
[19:50] <jrib> !permissions > crshman (read the private message from ubotu)
[19:51] <ConstyXIV> crdlb: so if you've got compiz working anyways, do you need (or get any advantage from) it for anything?
[19:51] <jrib> crshman: yep 755 and <user>:root would work
[19:51] <lixoman100> astronouth7303: in fact, 1680x1050 isn't even an option
[19:51] <tw2113> compiz fusion is eye candy only
[19:51] <astronouth7303> lixoman100: you sure your video card supports it?

[19:51] <rflmnz> Does anyone here knows how to enable FGLRX driver for an ATI X1300 on Ubnutu 7.10???
[19:51] <Robstafarian> I read a forum post from 2005 that listed "root=[partition] ro quiet splash," is that still correct?
[19:51] <saloxin> lixoman100: try Option "NoDDC"?
[19:51] <lixoman100> astronouth7303: yes, it is an GeForce 8800GTX and I always used 1680x1050 on XP and Vista
[19:51] <tw2113> generalsnus, look for "unrar"
[19:51] <Clinton__> I'm trying to do some video editing, and sometimes after a few minutes the videos become "scrambled".  Even if I just played the same video with no problems, playing it again it will be scrambled.  After that all videos play scrambled until I log out and log back in.   What is the cause of this problem and how can I prevent it?

[19:52] <lixoman100> saloxin: no, I never heard about that one. What should I do, exactly?
[19:52] <ffm> Help! Sound works in livecd but doenst work after install!
[19:52] <crdlb> ConstyXIV, it would probably be faster because nvidia's texture_from_pixmap isn't very good, but it breaks wine games and makes multihead more difficult
[19:52] <tw2113> if you aren't afraid of terminal, sudo apt-get install unrar
[19:52] <astronouth7303> lixoman100: and you're using the right drivers?
[19:52] <erpo> I have a friend in Iraq who wants to install ubuntu, but his firewall won't let him download more than 300MB in a single file. Does ubuntu have a small network install CD that will fetch the packages from an internet repository?

[19:52] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about shipit erpo - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[19:52] <lixoman100> astronouth7303: yes, this problem was here before and after allowing the restricted drivers to be installed automatically by gutsy
[19:52] <nickrud> dhamma: linux-source-2.6.22
[19:52] <picard_pwns_kirk> erpo: does ShipIt ship to Iraq?
[19:52] <ffm> !shipit | erpo
[19:52] <ubotu> erpo: shipit is a service that sends free Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu CDs. See http://shipit.ubuntu.com/ and http://shipit.kubuntu.org and http://shipit.edubuntu.org - Shipit will send Feisty (7.04) CDs
[19:53] <ffm> picard_pwns_kirk: iirc
[19:53] <dhamma> nickrud: ok...cool
[19:53] <gordonjcp> erpo: has he got any kind of Linux running?
[19:53] <Johnson> update manage is prompting me to upgrade to 7.10
[19:53] <erpo> gordonjcp: No.
[19:53] <saloxin> lixoman100: it sounds like your monitor reports wrong ddc. you can tell xorg to ignore it with this option in  xorg.conf - under Device section. you can also try
[19:53] <mmk0725> anyone else having repository issues when upgrading from Feisty to Gutsy?
[19:53] <saloxin> Option "IgnoreEDID" "on"
[19:53] <nickrud> JarG0n: no, there's no roleback
[19:53] <erpo> And I don't want to shipit. That takes weeks, no?
[19:53] <murlidhar> PriceChild: thanks i think i now get a little bit of clearer picture
[19:53] <alecwh> I used this: sudo apt-get install apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server to install a LAMP server on my ubuntu gusty pc, but PHP isn't working. (when I visit my php file in localhost, i can actually download the source file...) What's wrong?
[19:53] <gordonjcp> erpo: one possibility would be to download something fairly tiny and use wget to grab the iso
[19:53] <lamego> mmk0725, the repositories have been overloaded lately
[19:53] <sherl0ck> erpo: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[19:53] <Johnson> is it safe to upgrade to gutsy
[19:53] <gordonjcp> erpo: use "wget -c" to continue a broken download
[19:53] <KnightCPT> crdlb, thanks for the heads up, gonna restart X now :D
[19:54] <PriceChild> murlidhar, sorry I don't have much time atm... but if you're online in an hour or so i could discuss it further in pm
[19:54] <amrcidiot> guys, i need help. how do i add write permissions to my user?
[19:54] <We3Share> Can someone give me a hand configuring an ATI Radeon on a fresh install of Gutsy? Restricted drivers allows me to enable it. It reboots, runs reconfigure and I get back without it functioning.
[19:54] <saloxin> alecwh: shift+ctrl+reload in firefox? in case page is cached? apache restart?
[19:54] <simplyubuntu> can anyone advise me on download managers? i need one that will automatically resume the download if the router resets...
[19:54] <erpo> gordonjcp: When the firewall detects that the content length is over 300MB, it won't even allow the download to start.
[19:54] <mmk0725> Oh really? Any thoughts as to a good time of day to attempt?
[19:54] <lixoman100> Hey I got this on Xorg.0.log: No valid modes for "1680x1050@60"; removing.
[19:54] <tw2113> amrcidiot, man chmod
[19:54] <alecwh> saloxin: How do I restart it?
[19:54] <Robstafarian> guess I'll just use the arguments from that 2005 example, thanks anyway folks
[19:54] <lamego> alecwh, the last time I had the problem I had to clear the cookies on firefox, it was not a server side issue, it was a browser issue
[19:54] <generalsnus> tw2113: i installed UNRAR now.. but how do i use it?
[19:54] <tw2113> try that and see how far you can get using the info from that man page
[19:54] <murlidhar> PriceChild: oh no. no problem u helped me as much as u could
[19:54] <gordonjcp> erpo: I can't see how that would work
[19:54] <tw2113> generalsnus, try using archive manager again
[19:54] <saloxin> alecwh: /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
[19:54] <gordonjcp> erpo: the firewall has no way of knowing how long the content is
[19:54] <matthew_> how do i find out the /dev/whatever of a drive?
[19:54] <manic12> if i installed ubuntu from an amd64 iso, why does it say kernel is -generic on the system monitor?
[19:54] <nickrud> alecwh: try sudo e2enmod php5
[19:55] <erpo> gordonjcp: I think it's an http header.
[19:55] <stimpy77> I can't get sound capture to work. Mic works, audio works, but sound capture says "Failed to construct test pipeline" or "could not open resource for writing" from gconfaudiosrc
[19:55] <nickrud> alecwh: erm, a2enmod that is
[19:55] <rainwalker> if desktop effects in gutsy didn't work using the live cd, does that mean they won't work if I upgrade from feisty?
[19:55] <josh_marshall> Hey guys -- anyone else have the tzdata problems when upgrading?
[19:55] <Vis> Is there a way I can permanently exclude a package from appearing in the update manager?
[19:55] <Johnson> does anyone know if it safe to upgrade without using a cd?
[19:55] <alecwh> nickrud, what does that do?
[19:55] <mile92> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41382/
[19:55] <lamego> manic12, generic is the usual kernel now, there are no i386, i686, optimized kernels anymore, it's a generic 64bits kernel
[19:55] <jrib> !pinning > Vis (read the private message from ubotu)
[19:55] <manic12> ok, thanks lamego
[19:55] <picard_pwns_kirk> rainwalker: you might need to install the drivers first, and I don't think you can do that live
[19:56] <We3Share> Should I use the proprietary or opensource drivers for an ATI Radeon on a fresh install?
[19:56] <nickrud> alecwh: ensures that apache has enabled php; compare /etc/apache2/mods-enabled and /mods-available
[19:56] <crdlb> Vis, are you referring to compiz-core?
[19:56] <lamego> We3Share, if you want to use 3d acc apps, you will need the proprietary
[19:56] <amrcidiot> thanks
[19:56] <lixoman100> saloxin: so would it be Option "NoDDC" and Option "IgnoreEDID" "on" ?
[19:56] <rainwalker> picard_pwns_kirk: well the weird thing is that I'm already using Beryl/Compiz Fusion without any restricted drivers
[19:56] <Dyus> erpo: it even blocks BT?
[19:56] <mile92> please help... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41382/
[19:56] <akorn> anybody know why my menu bars dissapear when i'm using Beryl??
[19:56] <sistom> If I chmod 700 /home will that prevent users from accessing other users home directories?
[19:56] <riotkittie> rainwalker: thats not weird :P
[19:56] <erpo> Dyus: He's in the military. No BT.
[19:56] <We3Share> lixoman100: Got it...Let me see if that isn't the issue. . . .
[19:56] <nickrud> We3Share: open source until you've got a happily working system, then go on to the restricted if you want
[19:56]  * We3Share crosses fingers. 
[19:56] <lamego> sistom, you should  NOT chmod 700 /home !
[19:57] <tw2113> sistom, your home directory should be protected already
[19:57] <crdlb> akorn, nvidia?
[19:57] <saloxin> lixoman100: i believe so. can't finf any good docs on it though
[19:57] <We3Share> nickrud: The system is working except for my graphics card.
[19:57] <rainwalker> riotkittie: then why can't I use the desktop effects with the gutsy live cd?
[19:57] <mmk0725> Is there a good time of day to attempt the upgrade? When would the repositories be less taxed?
[19:57] <sistom> I don't want people to be able to even 'ls -al' in my home dir
[19:57] <lixoman100> saloxin: ok, I'll give it a try then. If the problem persist I'll be back. Thank you!
[19:57] <lamego>  /home is owned by root, chmod 700 means no other user will be able to access it
[19:57] <alecwh> nickrud: uegh. :P I wish this was easy.
[19:57] <nickrud> We3Share: what card? And what error
[19:57] <riotkittie> rainwalker: which graphics card?
[19:58] <rainwalker>  ATI Technologies Inc RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10]
[19:58] <akorn> crdlb: no i'm using Intel 945GMA
[19:58] <lamego> it should be safe to chmod 700 your own home dir instead
[19:58] <nickrud> alecwh: it gets easier cuz you learn more, but then harder because you learn new questions. Never ending cycle ;)
[19:58] <pazsion> riotkitty need to know what i'm doing wrong.. looks like everything is working i just need to configure it right ---wireless usb issues-----
[19:58] <akorn> crdlb: With AIGLX
[19:58] <crdlb> akorn, hmm I don't know why, but you should try upgrading to compiz fusion, ask in #compiz-fusion :)
[19:58] <We3Share> nickrud: It's a ATI Radeon...No error, if I enable in restricted --> Reboot, on reboot it asks me what driver, I selected open source, and got back into X without a change...Tried enable again...same deal...etc.
[19:58] <nivekc1> whats the difference between wine and codeweavers crossover
[19:58] <crdlb> We3Share, which radeon?
[19:58] <webpirate> hello all
[19:58] <Clinton__> wine is better
[19:59] <riotkittie> rainwalker: your card is blacklisted.  try running SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz
[19:59] <webpirate> I have a question for you guys..
[19:59] <saloxin> erpo: he could try netbooting. he'd have to set up a tftp server though. ftp://ftp.uninett.no/ubuntu/dists/gutsy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot
[19:59] <crdlb> nivekc1, crossover is a commercial version
[19:59] <webpirate> am I the only one who has trouble downloading the Flash player from the adobe site...it's SLOOOOWWWWW for about a year now...every tiim I try to get it it is slow
[19:59] <rainwalker> riotkittie: what do you mean? In a terminal while using the live cd?
[19:59] <crdlb> they're very similar though
[19:59] <We3Share> crdlb: I am not sure, but I will check just a sec.
[19:59] <Vis> crdlib: sorry, had to go play dad. Specifically yes in this case but it struck me as a useful thing to know.
[19:59] <lamego> nivekc1, crossover is an improved paid, wine
[19:59] <akorn> crdlb: Yea I have compiz installed but it's half and half...doesn't work nearly as well as Beryl was before i upgraded to 7.10 (now Beryl works fine except no menu bars!)
[19:59] <nivekc1> crdlb: runs the same software
[19:59] <riotkittie> rainwalker: yes, if youre currently using the live cd
[19:59] <erpo> saloxin: Actually, I found what I was looking for. If anyone else has the same problem, they should check out https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[19:59] <spasticteapot> I accidentally set my resolution to 640 x 480, and can't change it back!
[19:59] <We3Share> crdlb: Radeon 9550xl
[19:59] <spasticteapot> How do I change my resolution from the CLI?
[19:59] <nickrud> We3Share: you can run the regular open source, then?
[19:59] <rainwalker> riotkittie: no, I'm not but I'll try it
[19:59] <crdlb> akorn, beryl isn't in 7.10 at all
[19:59] <riotkittie> rainwalker: what are you running now?
[20:00] <icewolf> hi, im currently upgrading my laptop to gutsy so i closed the lid and let it upgrade. however when i open the lid the screen is blanck. i press osme keys but noting works, its still blank. now i can see that hard drive is still working so its still upgrading. is there a way to get the screen to show up

[20:00] <riotkittie> pazsion:  which chipset?
[20:00] <crdlb> We3Share, particularly if you're mainly interested on compiz
[20:00] <mortal1> how do I enable transparency on windows with compwiz?
[20:00] <We3Share> crdlb: Ok, but, how can I get into a res that is above 800 x 600...
[20:00] <crdlb> akorn, how?
[20:00] <tw2113> bout time i helped someone in here :D

[20:00] <lavender_dream> what's the command to save your alsamixer settings?
[20:00] <We3Share> Ok.

[20:01] <Tarkus_> if i want the 64-bit ubuntu.. do i just select amd64 as my cpu when i download 7.10??
[20:01] <pazsion> riotkitty it's an i810 and wireless apperas to be working just no internet....
[20:01]  * tw2113 sneezes repeatedly
[20:01] <Clinton__> snooo: aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
[20:01] <nivekc1> well i installed wine a while ago and tried to install an old windows game that didnt work
[20:01] <riotkittie> rainwalker: ah ok. yea, your card is blacklisted by default but that SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz will get it to load, and then you can add that to a file on the actual gutsy install [if you do install] to have it override the blacklisted
[20:01] <nickrud> !usplash | snooo
[20:01] <nivekc1> and im not to good with it
[20:01] <Clinton__> Tarkus_: download the amd64 iso
[20:01] <bmk789> is there any way to get madwifi or ndiswrapper working in amd64 gutsy?  ive been trying all morning with no luck

[20:02] <tw2113> welcome to linux
[20:02] <rainwalker> riotkittie: okay, but should I uninstall Compiz Fusion before upgrading?
[20:02] <mortal1> nickrud, is that under pref or system?
[20:02] <akorn> crdlb: Hah so it's not supposed to work at all in Gutsy? I know i had this happen to me in Feisty too (the no-menus thing) and i fixed it, i just really can't remmeber how or where i found the answer
[20:02] <riotkittie> rainwalker: yea, that's probably wise
[20:02] <webpirate> is the flash player download slow for anyone else?
[20:02] <tw2113> i just live without most windows stuff personally
[20:02] <kousotu> what is the rendering engine for Compiz-fusion?
[20:02] <a514> Why does the xorg.conf have a wacom tablet?!
[20:02] <webpirate> I am starting to think it's just me..
[20:02] <pazsion> riotKIttY i have a PM open for you
[20:02] <crdlb> akorn, nope, it's compiled for feisty so if it works it's a fluke
[20:02] <codecaine_> anybody know how I can stop compiz from trying to be my window manager
[20:02] <Flare183> How do i fix this error: http://flare183.pastebin.ca/743759
[20:02] <codecaine_> I want natiulus to be
[20:02] <akorn> crdlb: Then, can you tell me why the workspace switcher won't work in Compiz for me (but it works in Beryl)?
[20:02] <spasticteapot> Anyone know how to change resolution from the CLI?
[20:02] <We3Share> crdlb: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41385/
[20:02] <tw2113> kousotu, i imagine the aspect that renders your stuff as a cube and whatnot
[20:02] <nickrud> mortal1: prefs, you may need to install compizconfig-settings-manager
[20:02] <rainwalker> riotkittie: What about Beryl? I've had it since Edgy with no problems (both through upgrades, and with stability)

[20:03] <Dyus> Anyone know of a better hardware infor tool than the one provided with ubuntu?
[20:03] <ctw> Hi! Does anybody else here have problems with a dual monitor setup in Gutsy? It worked fine in Feisty, but broke in Gutsy ...
[20:03] <Colro> My oo.org keeps crashing -- I can't open a simple powerpoint ( http://blackhawkit.com/c0ld/ooproblem.png ) and whenever I try to change the general settings on writer it crashes as well. Do I need to reinstall it or something? :x
[20:03] <simplyubuntu> erpo try d4x
[20:03] <Clinton__> ctw: see the release notes, it explains there about dual monitor sestups
[20:03] <snooo> Clinton__, : yep, done that as well, its made no diff
[20:03] <nickrud> Dyus: dmidecode and lshw will tell you all
[20:03] <simplyubuntu> i think it splits downloads into parts, so that should get you past the firewall...
[20:03] <pazsion> well dang it
[20:03] <codecaine_> omg thank u so much crdlb!
[20:03] <Dyus> nickrud: they in the repos?
[20:03] <simplyubuntu> at least it gives that option
[20:03] <penguin42> hmm not seen lshw before
[20:03] <rainwalker> riotkittie: well I'd like to keep it because to this day it still works better than anything else and has only crashed once or twice

[20:06] <tw2113> Pacane, the best suggestion i have for that, is to just play around with it
[20:06] <Flare183> How do I fix this error http://flare183.pastebin.ca/743759
[20:06] <mortal1> great, i found it, it's exactly as it was in xubuntu
[20:06] <mortal1> ty
[20:06] <tw2113> see what stuff does
[20:06] <Tigerman> give me the link to the BIOS update for NVIDIA nForce2 Ultra 400 + MCP motherboard
[20:06] <akorn> a514: Yes
[20:06] <Davy_Jones> should i install Gnash or Flashplayer?
[20:06] <Ashfire908> vega-: will that restore deleted links?
[20:07] <tw2113> add a few so you don't mess up what you already have
[20:07] <a514> i just clicked on rotate cube icon
[20:07] <Tigerman> Davy_Jones, install Flashplayer
[20:07] <nickrud> Dave123: flashplugin-nonfree (Flashplayer)
[20:07] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[20:07] <Pacane> tw2113: Is there a good website where I can download some good designs?
[20:07] <TwoD> I've can't get into the desktop after upgrading to Gutsy. Normal boot hangs after reading local script files. Starting gdm Recovery mode gives me a login prompt where I can log in, but how do I get to the actual desktop?
[20:07] <vega-> Ashfire908: what do you mean by deleted links?
[20:07] <mmk0725> How do I bypass that ackage?
[20:07] <Davy_Jones> coo
[20:07] <Tigerman> Davy_Jones, Gnash is not well developt yet
[20:07] <crdlb> We3Share, yeah sorry I missed it
[20:07] <Tigerman> Davy_Jones, install Flashplayer!
[20:07] <tw2113> never heard of panel designs
[20:07] <TwoD> starting gdm *in recovery mode
[20:07] <jinxed> I upgraded to Gutsy today using the Update Manager. The upgrade seemed to go fine until the end. Right at the end of the upgrade, when cleanup was being done, I got a few errors... which I failed to record. Now when I boot, I get the login screen and after logging in, I get two error messages: 1. Nautilus can't be used now due to an unexpected error from Bonobo when attempting to register...
[20:07] <jinxed> ...the file manager view server. 2. The panel has encountered a fatal error. The panel could not register with the bonobo-activation server (Error code: 3) and will exit. It may be automatically restarted.
[20:07] <kousotu> what is the rendering engine for Compiz-fusion?
[20:07] <tw2113> so i don't know, i usually just play around
[20:07] <Pacane> Ok
[20:07] <kousotu> what is the rendering engine for Compiz-fusion (so everything workd)?
[20:07] <a514> kousotu beryl code mix
[20:08] <Pacane> Because i've seen on youtube people with taskbars looking like vista
[20:08] <lazd> koutostu: opengl
[20:08] <Melancholy> Hey, where can i find out what drivers i am using?
[20:08] <tw2113> i have one that acts like the bottom bar of OSX
[20:08] <Pacane> and some neat stuff..
[20:08] <Ashfire908> vega-: i clicked delete on the second instance of gnome-control-panel that appears when you enable the frist one, and it deleted both
[20:08] <nickrud> TwoD: you actually get a graphical login screen?
[20:08] <lazd> kousotu: join #compiz-fusion
[20:08] <We3Share> crdlb: No problem, I know it's crazy here....I am capable of following whatever direction, I've just never personally dealt w/ ATI issues...I have nvidia myself...
[20:08] <Davy_Jones> Clinton__: i just go to a website with flash then let firefox plugin finder install it.. is that the same?
[20:08] <tw2113> and 2 at the top for icons and window switchin
[20:08] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: nope
[20:08] <crdlb> We3Share, well you should switch to the "ati" driver
[20:08] <crdlb> you're using vesa now
[20:08] <Pacane> Did you use a special tool to manage the themes and etc..?
[20:08] <Davy_Jones> Clinton__: what's the difference?
[20:08] <TwoD> nickrud, no, just the command-line one
[20:08] <ctw> Clinton__: Thanks for the tip about the release notes ... it says that for intel cards i need the old "i810" driver ... my xorg.conf specifies "i810" as a driver ... do I need to install an older version?
[20:08] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: installation method
[20:08] <hasafraker> greetings
[20:09] <tw2113> not really when it comes to panels
[20:09] <Clinton__> ctw: not sure on the fix there, don't the release notes say?
[20:09] <Davy_Jones> Clinton__: but the end result will be the same, yes?
[20:09] <akorn> a514: I don't see a setting in there though?
[20:09] <tw2113> mine aren't all that advanced either
[20:09] <Pacane> Ok.
[20:09] <We3Share> crdlb: when I enabled restricted...it rebooted and asked me what driver...I selected ATI and it rebooted back without change...But I selected opensource not proprietary...Should I use proprietary instead?
[20:09] <bananamuzzj> Guys, after i installed fglrx 8.40.4 the direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
[20:09] <bananamuzzj>     GLX_ATI_pixel_format_float, GLX_ATI_render_texture
[20:09] <tw2113> contact the youtube people about it
[20:09] <Pacane> I saw people changing icons and stuff
[20:09] <webpirate> incase anyone cares Envy, amsn, google earth and automatix all worked for ME under ubuntu 7.10....
[20:09] <Pacane> and all the styles
[20:09] <Pacane> :P
[20:09] <nickrud> TwoD: ok, that's not gdm, but the console. Try sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg , and then telinit 2 to test
[20:09] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: yes
[20:09] <bananamuzzj> the installation didnt gave me any error :/
[20:09] <Davy_Jones> Clinton__: thanks mate
[20:09] <tw2113> i might actually go install gutsy soon
[20:09] <bananamuzzj> now my direct rendering is fucked
[20:09] <crdlb> We3Share, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[20:09] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: I recommened using aptitude, it makes for a cleaner install and you'll get bug fixes
[20:09] <hasafraker> I have what I hope is a small issue, I think I fat fingered my password exactly the same way when installing on a very slow laptop is there any why to correct that?
[20:10] <ctw> Clinton__: they just say that I need to use the "'old' i810 driver" ... I'm definitely using i810, but perhaps there's an older version I need?
[20:10] <crdlb> and choose "ati"
[20:10] <Pacane> Its worth it..
[20:10] <vega-> Ashfire908: umm, dunno.. deleting .g* should give you the menus and taskbar as they are after a fresh install
[20:10] <webpirate> BUT....
[20:10] <tw2113> :D
[20:10] <bananamuzzj> the fglrxinfo : gdirect rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
[20:10] <bananamuzzj>     GLX_ATI_pixel_format_float, GLX_ATI_render_texture
[20:10] <Pacane> Much easier with drivers and stuff
[20:10] <We3Share> crdlb: Ok, got it...
[20:10] <Pacane> and 3d things
[20:10] <Pacane> ;)
[20:10] <bananamuzzj> :P
[20:10] <Ashfire908> vega-: where do i run that command?
[20:10] <lamego> bananamuzzj, have you installed the ati driver from the ubuntu repositories ?
[20:10] <webpirate> I could not get the restricted drivers to work but ENVY managed to sort things out for me
[20:10] <bananamuzzj> Yes, but i didnt need that one
[20:10] <nickrud> TwoD: and if you still have a black screen, hit ctl-alt-f1 to get to a console again
[20:10] <Davy_Jones> Clinton__: can i use Synaptic instead?
[20:10] <TwoD> nickrud, yeah I know that's not gdm, but it says gdm is already running when I try to start it. Will try what you said later (dual-booting)
[20:10] <bananamuzzj> i installed the one on the ati site
[20:10] <TwoD> ah
[20:10] <bananamuzzj> because i wanted support for "ETQW"
[20:10] <nickrud> TwoD: then at that point, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[20:10] <bananamuzzj> the installation went perfect :/
[20:11] <webpirate> So you may want to try ENVY if you are having troouble with the restricted drivers in ubuntu
[20:11] <kousotu> where is xorg.conf? (call me stupid for not writing it down...)
[20:11] <nickrud> !envy
[20:11] <ubotu> envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[20:11] <jakamo> Who here can tell me  how to change the silly little green man back to an exit door?
[20:11] <Ashfire908> jinxed: it said it could be auto restarted, so i *assume* you could try launching nautlis
[20:11] <webpirate> xorg.conf = /etx/X11/xorg.conf
[20:11] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: yup, you can use snyaptic

[20:11] <lazd> jakamo: CHange your hteme in Appearance
[20:11] <kousotu> jakamo: use another icon set
[20:11] <nickrud> jakamo: you need to change your icon theme
[20:11] <rainwalker> riotkittie: how do I know which compiz packages to uninstall?
[20:11] <webpirate> ARGGG...I mean etc/X11/xorg.conf
[20:11] <We3Share> crdlb: Run that at term now, then reboot? or logout to term and run it?
[20:11] <kousotu> thanks webpirate
[20:11] <Wikzo> I wanna delte some of my home made emblems in Ubuntu 7.10. Where are they stored?
[20:11] <jakamo> I never changed my theme
[20:11] <bananamuzzj> Anyone can help me fixing this?
[20:11] <Xera> I'm installing Kubuntu, I accidentally closed the installer window, another one popped up saying "Installing system", it's blank and nothing is happening.. help?
[20:12] <crdlb> We3Share, restarting X should be enough
[20:12] <NullNone> Gnome-system monitor documentation says that there have to be a menu item View->Threads
[20:12] <NullNone> But there is no that menu item in real program on Ubuntu 7.10.
[20:12] <NullNone> I have all updates installed, and can't understand is the documentation wrong or is there a bug in Gnome-system-monitor.
[20:12] <jinxed> Ashfire:tried that. I got the same message, but no extra information on the command line
[20:12] <KI4IKL> hwo can I search for packages in apt via command line
[20:12] <kousotu> ..
[20:12] <We3Share> crdlb: Ok, I ran the command, now I'll give it a whirl.
[20:12] <TwoD> thanks nickrud, where did you find that out?
[20:12] <lamego> KI4IKL, apt-cache search name
[20:12] <KI4IKL> thanks lamego
[20:12] <ndee> hi there, how can I change the language in gnome?
[20:12] <Xera> Is it safe to just reboot and start the installation again? Could this corrupt my Windows partition?
[20:12] <jnc> KI4IKL: apt-cache search (your criteria here)
[20:12] <nickrud> TwoD: practice, and tldp.org
[20:12] <Ashfire908> anyone know how to restore the gnome menus to the way they are when yopu first install?
[20:12] <webpirate> NOTE:: If your icons are missing in open office...go to synaptic and install the openoffice themes......
[20:13] <jnc> KI4IKL: I suggest using synaptic GUI package manager to search and find what you're looking for though
[20:13] <vlt> Hello. I have run upgrade to gutsy successfully on one of three machines here. How can I upgrade the others w/o downloading all again? Copy /var/cache/apt/archives/* to the other two boxes?
[20:13] <guanabi> hola hablais español?
[20:13] <sojourney> hi guys
[20:13] <Clinton__> I'm trying to do some video editing, and sometimes after a few minutes the videos become "scrambled".  Even if I just played the same video with no problems, playing it again it will be scrambled.  After that all videos play scrambled until I log out and log back in.   What is the cause of this problem and how can I prevent it?
[20:13] <nickrud> Ashfire908: you mean the panels?
[20:13] <_blitz_> I cant pair with my nokia phone via usb.somebody help please
[20:13] <TwoD> nickrud, ah will take a look there =)
[20:13] <lamego> Xera, the ubuntu installer will not touch your windows partitions unless you did it manually with the part editor
[20:13] <guanabi> hola?
[20:13] <jnc> Clinton__: video driver problem, I know this sounds generic, it is
[20:13] <kousotu> o..k...
[20:13] <jnc> I'm not a systems programmer
[20:13] <lamego> Xera, your windows will only become unbootable if there is a serious problem with the grub install
[20:13] <kousotu> why is my xorg.conf blank....
[20:13] <penguin42> vlt: Yeh copying the archives directory should save most of the download
[20:13] <Ashfire908> !spanish | Guanabi
[20:13] <ubotu> Guanabi: Si busca ayuda en Español por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, allí obtendrá mas ayuda.
[20:13] <nickrud> Ashfire908: if so, gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/panel
[20:13] <sojourney> guanabi, where are you from?
[20:13] <Xera> lamego: but it's modifying the partition table so if I just abort it couldn't that screw up my partitions?
[20:13] <jnc> Clinton__: specifically something mucky happening with overlays
[20:13] <Clinton__> jnc: using nvidia drivers has never resulted in a problem before
[20:13] <Ashfire908> nickrud: no just the menus
[20:14] <Clinton__> jnc: alright, what can I do to fix it?
[20:14] <lamego> Xera, if you abort, it shouldn't write the changes at all
[20:14] <DaneM> Hello, all.  I have an odd problem.  I'm running a Tiger3xx modem (according to lspci), with 2 fxs modules, and 2 fxo modules.  The fxo modules connect to the phone company, and the fxs modules connect to handsets.  The problem is that one of the fxs modules seems to have stopped generating dialtone, and does not receive incoming calls.  As far as I can tell, it's set up the same way as the other one, but when I pick up the handset, 
[20:14] <jnc> Clinton__: try finding some folks who run the same setup as you, I guess
[20:14] <plik> werd up, how's it going?
[20:14] <Xera> lamego: it was in the process of installing
[20:14] <Mith36> Hi all.  I am having no luck finding help on the forums, so I thought I'd ask here.  I recently upgraded to 7.10 and I have an ati radeon x1800 card. Ubuntu keeps crashing me back to the log in screen whenever I try to run fglrxinfo to troubleshoot my ubuntu vid troubles. How can I figure out what's wrong (I don't see crash report) or does anyone have any suggestions?
[20:14] <Clinton__> jnc: looks like I'll go to usenet for that :)
[20:14] <neztit1> hi
[20:14] <webpirate> Clinton>> I never had troubles with nvidia drivers until 7.10.... I enabled the restricted drivers and it did not work...so I tried ENVY and it went no problems
[20:14] <MMK07253> Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty-security/restricted/binary-i386/Packages.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
[20:14] <MMK07253> How do I bypass this?
[20:14] <_blitz_> I cant pair with my nokia phone via usb.somebody help please
[20:14] <jnc> Clinton__: yeah, heh.  good luck though, I've seen this before when video drivers go bad, it's frustrating for me.
[20:14] <neztit1> how i can open port on gusty???
[20:15] <lamego> Xera, the only way your windows partition can be affected, is, if you have deleted it, and applied the change
[20:15] <jnc> neztit1: elaborate.
[20:15] <Clinton__> jnc: especially when trying to edit videos, argh!
[20:15] <Xera> lamego: ok
[20:15] <Colro> My oo.org keeps crashing -- I can't open a simple powerpoint ( http://blackhawkit.com/c0ld/ooproblem.png ) and whenever I try to change the general settings on writer it crashes as well. Do I need to reinstall it or something? :x
[20:15] <Ashfire908> MMK07253: you don't
[20:15] <lamego> Xera, still, if it was the case, as long you dont touch the disk, it should be easier to recover (in case you really need it)
[20:15] <jnc> Clinton__: I don't know man, I'd get a mac if I needed to edit video
[20:15] <MMK07253> Ashfire908 - what do I do?
[20:15] <neztit1> jnc:  w8??
[20:15] <nickrud> Ashfire908: rm ~/.local/share/applications/* will do that,
[20:15] <mnemo> why is it not possible to join channel #ubuntu+1 right now???
[20:15] <jnc> neztit1: English, please?
[20:15] <Clinton__> jnc: I don't do it for a living, I'm just trying to put together some family vids - nothing enough to invest in a mac
[20:15] <penguin42> mnemo: Because most of ubuntu+1 should now be here for gutsy
[20:15] <wirechief> Mith36 try this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[20:16] <nickrud> mnemo: it's turned off
[20:16] <erUSUL> mnemo: there is no ubuntu+1 released yet
[20:16] <kousotu> !beryl
[20:16] <ubotu> Beryl has been merged with Compiz to form Compiz-Fusion.  New Beryl installs are discouraged. See also !compiz
[20:16] <neztit1> what you say???
[20:16] <picard_pwns_kirk> mnemo: 'cause Gutsy is now the norm
[20:16] <stefg> Colro, same here after a fresh install. Do you use the default gtk-theme ?
[20:16] <neztit1> first?
[20:16] <Ashfire908> MMK07253: ever so often, a bad gzip file is put on the server. the only thing you can do is wait till the file on the server is fixed
[20:16] <Mith36> thanks wirechief
[20:16] <kousotu> erg..
[20:16] <hasafraker> if the password I think I used is wrong is there any way to sort that out without reinstalling the whole system?
[20:16] <jnc> Clinton__: yeah, my hat's off to you if you manage to do it.  "kino" is neato
[20:16] <Colro> stefg: No, I've got theme I downloaded.
[20:16] <mnemo> okay, but is there a channel for developers working on #ubuntu+1 ???
[20:16] <Clinton__> jnc: yup, that's what I'm trying to use here too
[20:16] <derrrface> new to ubnutu. i have the prior version 7.6.... thinking of upgrading to 7.10. Is it possible to upgrade w/o installing a fresh copy? is it worth it to do this?
[20:16] <neztit1> jnc:  how i can open port
[20:16] <Wikzo> I want to delete some of my home made emblems in Ubuntu 7.10. Where are they stored?
[20:16] <wirechief> Mith36 there is good info there but i ended up using a xorg.conf from my kanotix distro to finally get things resolved
[20:16] <nickrud> mnemo: I think they're partying to hard to work right now ;)
[20:16] <penguin42> derrrface: Yes you can upgrade
[20:17] <MMK07253> Ashfire908 - Aha! I suspected this....thanks for your help!
[20:17] <Hilikus> how do i chmod a tree recursively but so that only FILES are changed, not dirs
[20:17] <stefg> Colro, test by making a fresh user with the default theme. old themes seem to be problematic
[20:17] <secret901> how do I change the owner of everything in a directory?
[20:17] <penguin42> MMK07253: It's probably that - but just check you haven't run out of disc space etc
[20:17] <jnc> Hilikus: good question, it's not the answer you're expecting... but use 'find'
[20:17] <Hilikus> secret901 chown
[20:17] <derrrface> penguin42: I haven't downloaded the live cd yet.. Is this an option on the cd, or is there a different way to do this?
[20:17] <LjL> secret901: chown -R name:name directory
[20:17] <simplyubuntu> hey has anyone done the ndiswrapper/bcm43xx install with cabextract method
[20:17] <LjL> secret901: "man chown" helps
[20:17] <lamego> Hilikus, find /dir -type -f -exec chmod modes {} \;
[20:17] <neztit1> jnc:  tcp port i mean
[20:17] <erUSUL> secret901: right click on the dir and choose properties>permisions
[20:17] <secret901> LjL: thanks
[20:17] <gouki> secret901: chown -R <user> /path/to/directory/
[20:17] <nickrud> Wikzo: ~/.nautilus/patterns
[20:17] <Mith36> wirechief: was fglrxinfo crashing you too?
[20:17] <penguin42> derrrface: If you have a running 'feisty' install then you can do it without the livecd
[20:18] <jnc> neztit1: 'iptables -L' as root to list them...  beyond this, I don't know
[20:18] <Dmitry_> i tried upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10, but an error was given, and i was told to report it as an update-manager bug. anyway, /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log contains the error: IOError in cache.update(): 'Failed to fetch http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty-backports/Release Unable to find expected entry  multivers/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?). what could be a solution to that?
[20:18] <derrrface> penguin42: how?
[20:18] <Ashfire908> nickrud, what exactly will deleting those files do?
[20:18] <jnc> neztit1: ports shouldn't be firewalled on a Gutsy install, AFAIK
[20:18] <neztit1> jnc:  thank u
[20:18] <Clinton__> Dmitry_: keep trying, the servers might just be overloaded
[20:18] <penguin42> derrrface: You need to run update-manager
[20:18] <ndee> if someone could tell me where I can change the default language in gnome, that would be great :D
[20:18] <Zambezi> I need general advise about which OS I should use on my server. Is there a channel for that here on Freenode?
[20:18] <jnc> Hilikus: if you want more info, privmsg me I'll walk you through it
[20:18] <Wikzo> nickrud: Doen't exist
[20:19] <escobar5> hello everyone, im having some problem since i upgraded to gusty, when i log into gnome session, just after a few seconds i get a blank screen, what can be happening?
=== magick is now known as m2
=== m2 is now known as m235
[20:19] <derrrface> penguin42: ahh thanks!
[20:19] <nickrud> der0b: if you don't want to use penguin42 's technique (nice to have the cd for emergencies) use the alternate cd (live cannot upgrade)
[20:19] <Dmitry_> Clinton__, tried it four times so far. viewed the file well in my browser. i'll try a few more times, though
[20:19] <Ashfire908> nickrud: sorry i just dislike deleteing stuff that i don't know what effect of deleting it is
[20:19] <jnc> Zambezi: Ubuntu Server is mature.  I would use it in an enterprise setting, unless there was a requirement on Redhat stuff
[20:19] <penguin42> derrrface: I think you might have to use the '-c' option
[20:19] <derrrface> nickrud: thnx also
[20:19] <scales> hey all got a quick question.  i just got office2003 to work under gusty, and it wants to update my version of wine.  i dont want it to upgrade wine because then i lose some of the compatibility.  how do i have the update manager not appear and ask me?
[20:19] <Clinton__> Dmitry_: wait a while, such as an hour, and try again

[20:20] <K3nto> what kind of theme should i be looking for?\
[20:20] <rainwalker> lamego: well, the only problem is that I don't know what some of them are for...

[20:21] <ChOcO-Bn> hi
[20:21] <vice> hi all i have a trouble: i follow upgrading procedure from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GutsyUpgrades, but message informing me of the availability of the new release is not appearing. how can i upgrade?
[20:21] <lamego> rainwalker, just comment everything which is not from ubuntu.com
[20:21] <Dmitry_> Clinton__, could i pick another download location?
[20:21] <tweakedInferno> how do you control the visual effects in the new ubutu i lost my cube?
[20:21] <nickrud> Ashfire908: the default menu is at /usr/share/applications
[20:21] <Clinton__> Dmitry_: not easily
[20:21] <arooni> Clinton__, if i get gdm up.........
[20:21] <jnc> rainwalker: 3rd party repos could screw up your upgrade path, FYI
[20:21] <ChOcO-Bn> i've got a problem with my cf/sd card reader : http://pastebin.org/5440
[20:21] <nickrud> Ashfire908: no need
[20:21] <arooni> should i still try to boot with no acpi
[20:21] <K3nto> !theme
[20:21] <rainwalker> lamego: couldn't that break things that are currently working, though?

[20:21] <Ashfire908> nickrud, ok
[20:21] <escobar5> sbaynham, thanks for your attention, the problem is that when i press ctrl alt f* i dont get any prompt, its just the black screen with the pointer blinking at the top of the screen
[20:21] <Zambezi> jnc: No it's not... I just got screwed by it. :-(
[20:21] <K3nto> !changethemes
[20:21] <Dmitry_> Clinton__, would that help, though?
[20:21] <ubotu> To change your themes, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuEyeCandy.  Kubuntu users should visit https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CustomizeKubuntu.
[20:21] <tuxcrafter> hello i am looking for the following deb file:  linux-image-2.6.22-11-386
[20:22] <lamego> rainwalker, no, running applications do not depend on existing apps, but yes, applications which are not upgraded will likely to be removed or to break after the upgrade

[20:22] <tuxcrafter> were can i find it?
[20:22] <secret901> After I upgraded to Gutsy, everytime my laptop resumes from suspend, it gets disconnected from the wireless network and sometimes never reconnects.  If it ever reconnects, it takes about 30 seconds.
[20:22] <lamego> ops, existing repos

[20:22] <Ashfire908> nickrud: thanks.
[20:22] <lgc__> What can I use instead of "crypt" on the command line in order to encrypt a file?
[20:22] <sbaynham> And then click preferences, and put a tick next to the desktop cube pulgin.
[20:22] <lgc__> What can I use instead of "crypt" on the command line in order to encrypt a file?

[20:22] <BlackShuck2> I can't believe how badly broken the PS3 release of 7.10 is.  The install is in the wrong resolution, but if you manage to overcome that hurdle, wired networking is busted, no screen resolutions, hangs on shutdown.   Is it REALLY that diffucult to make a release for standard hardware like the PS3?
[20:22] <nickrud> lgc__: gpg
[20:22] <ernz> Hello, can someone help me install my printer please. I have waited 2 months for Gutsy to come out JUST to use my printer. I did an upgrade and it still won't work :(

[20:23] <bananamuzzj> hmm, guys after i installed fglrx drivers of ati
[20:23] <sbaynham> If you don't have these options, you need to install the package compizconfig-settings-manager

[20:23] <stefg> Colro, what are you doing with debian sid packages ??? you should uninstall it, not put sid packages on your ubuntu and break it with that
[20:23] <lamego> rainwalker, I don't use 3rd party apt repositories in general, anyway, ANY non official repository may break your system during upgrade
[20:24] <lamego> if is much safer to comment them out

[20:25] <bananamuzzj> i rebooted
[20:25] <erin> Hi, everyone. I just installed 7.10, but it won't boot! I think it's because my old IDE hard drive showed up as SDA and my SATA drive, on which I installed Ubuntu, is SDB. How do I make the SATA drive SDA so it will boot?
[20:25] <m235> LjL, I can't make a fake package?
[20:25] <IceflamePhoenix> evening
[20:25] <rainwalker> lamego: well some of them are for eyecandy, I see medibuntu in there too, fonts, AWN, Wine, and one or two I don't know
[20:25] <LjL> m235: yes, you can do that.
[20:25] <LjL> !info equivs | m235
[20:25] <usser> m235: that kinda defeats all the purpose of apt-get

[20:26] <erin> penguin: Fresh install
[20:26] <rainwalker> lamego: from /etc/apt/sources.list right?
[20:26] <nickrud> matthew_: ls /dev will show them all, it's the one not in fdisk I'd guess

[20:35] <bruenig> hasafraker, root
[20:35] <Ashfire908> when i enable the desktop effects, all the window bars disappear
[20:35] <nickrud> hasafraker: boot into recovery mode, and then passwd <user>
[20:35] <thndrempr> @genjutsu mine is the same
[20:35] <Clinton__> hasafraker: boot from a livecd, CD into your main system, and change the password for tha tuser
[20:36] <yooper08> yeah its an xpress 1100
[20:36] <crdlb> yooper08, you need Xgl, install xserver-xgl
[20:36] <Clinton__> hasafraker: err, not cd, chroot
[20:36] <lamego> hasafraker, a broken password ? You mean, to restore accesso to a single user system with a lost password ?
[20:36] <charles> thanks
[20:36] <yooper08> ah yeah

[20:36] <genjutsu> uthndrempr: use -noapic before booting with the ubuntu disk

[20:37] <Clinton__> hasafraker: open a terminal, enter the command sudo su
[20:37] <nickrud> arooni: disable the medibuntu repo
=== disappear is now known as [explorer]
[20:37] <roadfish> nickrud: do you have a good URL that describes repo removal/cleanup
[20:37] <hasafraker> ok
[20:37] <lgc__> plik, lamego I'm afraid it's too complicated for what I'm looking. How would I encrypt a string or a file without resorting to generating public and private keys and all that fuss? What's the function that encrypts passwords?
[20:37] <karel> I'm confused about which drivers all exist for ati (x1400 in my case) cards exists and if any of them standard work with compiz etc. Can somebody sum them up for me? thanks
[20:37] <Shadoslayer> Hey folks, I'm having a bit of a problem and hoping you can help me out. I was running ubuntu 6.06 which installed fine, but with v7.04 (haven't tried 7.10 yet) it boots up fine, gets me into xorg but my screen is all garbled up. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
[20:37] <Clinton__> hasafraker: that will then give you root access, now you need to make sure that your / is mounted
[20:37] <nickrud> arooni: a good idea to disable all 3d party repos during an upgrade
[20:37] <thndrempr> @genjusu i have to press f6 and then use -noapic rite?
[20:37] <yooper08> nope didn' work
[20:37] <genjutsu> thndrempr: i also had difficulties installing it as it is. the noapic parameter should do the trick
[20:37] <astronouth7303> lgc__: do you need a reversable encryption?
[20:37] <yooper08> still tells me effects couldn't be enabled
[20:37] <hasafraker> Clinton__ bear with me this is wicked slow laptop
[20:37] <thndrempr> @genjusu k.. thanks
[20:37] <lgc__> astronouth7303, yes.
[20:37] <lamego> lgc__, passwords can't be decrypted
[20:37] <Ashfire908> secret901: yep. no window borders. effects were working before...
[20:37] <skriv> what is the default root password
[20:38] <hasafraker> took almost 4hrs to install it
[20:38] <lgc__> lamego, right.
[20:38] <astro76> Shadoslayer, I'd try 7.10 before troubleshooting 7.04
[20:38] <hasafraker> only PII
[20:38] <lamego> lgc__, you want a reversible encryption, right ?
[20:38] <Ashfire908> skriv, null
[20:38] <Hristo> Hello, does someone know how to remap Caps lock to something like - send Caps Lock but set Caps Lock state off (so caps lock is always off)?
[20:38] <thndrempr> @genjusu but will it disable any features like wireless support??
[20:38] <secret901> Ashfire908: the problem I had was when I enabled desktop effects, the minimize buttons and close buttons disappear
[20:38] <nickrud> roadfish: not really ;) The simplest is to disable the repo you want to remove all traces of, update your sources, then look at obsolete in synaptic. Those are from the now unknown source
[20:38] <Shadoslayer> astro: I know, I just hate to waste another CD if this issue hasn't been fixed :)
[20:38] <astronouth7303> lgc__: in a lot of software, the passwords are just hashed. to compare them, one hashes the attempt and compare the hashes
[20:38] <secret901> Ashfire908: I fixed it by reinstalling compiz
[20:38] <lgc__> lamego, only checked against the output of "crypt" or whatever.
[20:38] <skriv> doesnt work
[20:38] <r0b-> Ubuntu cant read Nvidia chipsets right
[20:38] <Ashfire908> skriv: there is no root password. use sudo
[20:38] <Ax-Ax> What shall I do to get my Soundblaster Live! 5.1 Dell oem to work with recording? Is there anything I can do? If i try recording with Audacity it just says: Error while opening sound device. Please check the input device settings and the project sample rate.
[20:38] <skriv> gotcha
[20:38] <Scott0> http://img141.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotqx7.png <--- why would this be happeneing?
[20:38] <kbrooks> r0b-, wrong
[20:39] <skriv> so no root account exists....like a traditional nix?
[20:39] <secret901> Ashfire908: sudo apt-get install compiz
[20:39] <lamego> lgc__, you can use md5 :)
[20:39] <Tarkus_> whats more popular, and comes standard with most commonly used distros? gnome/gtk or kde/qt?
[20:39] <astro76> Shadoslayer, I feel my time is worth more than 25 cents ;)
[20:39] <genjutsu> thndrempr: yep... the only thing thats not running out of the box is the wireless lan.   You have to configure its driver to make it work in ubuntu
[20:39] <Mith36> hristo:I doubt this is what you want, but if you run  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg there is a dialog box that pops up about halfway through that tells you how to do that during the keyboard set up
[20:39] <r0b-> its seeing my Athlon X2 4200+ wrong
[20:39] <lgc__> astronouth7303, I've always been confused by the meaning of "hash".
[20:39] <Clinton__> skriv: there is a root account but it has an unknown scrambled password
[20:39] <plik> or rot13 !!  ;)
[20:39] <lamego> md5 is commonly used for password matching
[20:39] <nickrud> skriv: the account exists, but has no password to log in with
[20:39] <astro76> Clinton__, baloney, there is no password
[20:39] <Shadoslayer> astro: good point. Anyway, I'm downloading 7.10 now so I'll give it a whirl.
[20:39] <lamego> plik, rot13 vs md5 :P ?
[20:39] <skriv> thanks guys
[20:39] <Hristo> Mith36, thank you, i'll try :)
[20:39] <Clinton__> astro76: scrambled or no password, still can't login
[20:39] <Mith36> well, you can reroute it to ctrl instead of caps.
[20:39] <neco_77> hi
[20:39] <astro76> Clinton__, if there is no password set, it is disabled
[20:39] <astronouth7303> lgc__: basically, it's a "summary" of data, for quick comparison. Usually MD5 or SHA
=== johnny_ is now known as Initd
[20:39] <nickrud> or a password that cannot be typed, more accurately
[20:39] <astro76> Clinton__, no need to make up stuff though

[20:41] <Mith36> Okay, so I take it then that if fglrxinfo crashes ubuntu it produces no crash report or log? That seems odd to me.
[20:41] <Scott0> so why would scrolling or moving a window  cause a problem with the graphics?
[20:41] <andresmujica> hmmm... i would say no. it´ s really too crowded

[20:41] <secret901> Ashfire908: what does it say when you try sudo apt-get install compiz?
[20:41] <penguin42> wirechief: Go to System->administration->Screen and Graphics
[20:41] <astronouth7303> lgc__: the perl data structure known has hashes (aka dicts or mappings in other languages) are called that because a hash tree is used, most likely

[20:42] <penguin42> Judgegeo: You don't set any mount point for swap, and the main one is /
[20:42] <wirechief> penguin42: thanks
[20:42] <nickrud> Judgegeo: the 20 at /  , swap has no mount point
[20:42] <lamego> Mith36, have you checked /var/log/messages ?

[20:42] <lgc__> astronouth7303, thanks.
[20:42] <rainwalker> I'm in the process of upgrading, and I just got this error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41394/
[20:42] <nickrud> yooper08: that way for me also, but I am running compiz.  compiz --replace && emerald --replace
[20:42] <rainwalker> is this a problem?
[20:42] <Clinton__> hasafraker: any luck?
[20:42] <secret901> Ashfire908: try the terminal
[20:42] <Davy_Jones>  firefox crashes when viewing a flash video, is that common?
[20:42]  * franixe_ has fallen asleep at his keyboard
[20:42]  * plik reminds astronouth7303  that lgc__  doesn't like reading
[20:42] <bananamuzzj> need help with fglrx
[20:42] <Clinton__> Davy_Jones: nope
[20:42] <bananamuzzj> it's totally fucked
[20:42] <Ax-Ax> What shall I do to get my Soundblaster Live! 5.1 Dell oem to work with recording? Is there anything I can do?
[20:42] <thndrempr> @genjusu lol.. k thanks..
[20:42] <Mith36> wow this file is massive :)
[20:42] <penguin42> Davy_Jones: It's been known in the past, it shouldn't do it these days
[20:43] <athem> is there a way to make ubuntu 7.10 power off my computer once it is done shutting down?
[20:43] <lamego> rainwalker, the problem, is that I told you about 100 times to comment 3rd party repositories :)
[20:43] <nickrud> rainwalker: disable the medibuntu repos during your upgrade, along with any other 3d party repos. They're probably getting hammered
[20:43] <Ashfire908> secret901:  i can reinstall it myself
[20:43] <nownott> ok well when i do ping www.google.com i get ping: unknown host www.google.com
[20:43] <spore> Anyone know when Canonical repos for Gutsy will be available?
[20:43] <Judgegeo> @nickrud WHat type do i set the swap to? Currently i have both partitions set as ext3
[20:43] <rainwalker> lamego: Sorry, I didn't think medibuntu counted as 3rd party
[20:43] <Andycasss> I need some guidance - I am trying to set a command repeat when the destination address is not reachable. With a delay of 5 min
[20:43] <Eyal_D> Hi everyone .. I've just installed ubuntu newest version .. how can I use 3d Desktop effects?
[20:43] <GTroy> !upgrade
[20:43] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[20:43] <nickrud> Judgegeo: swap , you it's called swap :)
[20:43] <lamego> rainwalker, everything which is not *.ubuntu.com ;)
[20:43] <genjutsu> thndrempr: dont worry, you will still have your windows vista after installing ubuntu. It automatically configures dual boot
[20:43] <Hungerhaken> Hello :-) Does we have an german ubuntu channel here?
[20:43] <Scott0> compiz isnt on by default?
[20:43] <lgc__> lamego, MD5 will deliver just a checksum or something like that, won't it?
[20:43] <bananamuzzj> Guys. how can i remove the ATi drivers and reset the xorg.conf @ videocard section

[20:44] <BoomSie> someone here familiar with Gutsy and that you can only control the volume through PCM and not the default mixer?
[20:44] <rainwalker> lamego: what should I do now? I can click the "close" button on the window, but won't that continue with the upgrade?
[20:44] <GTroy> how bad is a distro upgrade versus a clean install?
[20:44] <secret901> Ashfire908: anyway, reinstalling compiz and ubuntu-desktop did the job for me...I didn't have to remove them first
[20:44] <Hungerhaken> Thanks :-)
[20:44] <lamego> lgc__, yes, it is widely used for password match
[20:44] <Judgegeo> @nickrud Ah thanks, all sorted now. Will crack on with installation
[20:44] <Ashfire908> GTroy: the upgrade should be ok
[20:44] <lamego> GTroy, very bad, clean install is much cleaner
[20:44] <mannytu> ubotu: permission
[20:44] <nickrud> GTroy: I've seen problems with both here, choose your poison :)
[20:44] <ubotu> The files and directories on an Ubuntu system are organized according to a standard, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard - file permissions are explained at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions - All filenames and directory names (and many other things) are case sensitive in Linux
[20:44] <penguin42> GTroy: Dist upgrades usually work, but sometimes you can get unlucky and need to clear out some pesky packages
[20:44] <crdlb> GTroy, it depends on how much you've done to your install
[20:44] <rainwalker> GTroy: Clean installs seem to work better in terms of not breaking, but you lose your stuff from before
[20:44] <thndrempr> @genjusu k.. im browing the forums for help..
[20:44] <nickrud> lol
[20:44] <bruenig> GTroy, distro upgrades in discrete release distros are known to be problematic, fresh install is a hassle, your choice
[20:44] <nalioth> spore: there is no need to patch your router as long as you connect to port 8001. (half the time, the router patch doesn't work anyway)
[20:44] <BoomSie> distro-upgrade: you transport your sh*t over to the next, with the risk also taking bad things with it. Clean install is faster in the end (faster in the way of ... performance)
[20:44] <Andycasss> I need some guidance - I am trying to set a command repeat when the destination address is not reachable. With a delay of 5 min
[20:44] <lamego> Ashfire908, you should look for the complains on upgrades :)
[20:44] <Ashfire908> secret901: what do you think i'm doing
[20:44] <thndrempr> @genjusu i'll let u know if i find anything
[20:44] <Tarkus_> whats more popular, and comes standard with most commonly used distros? gnome/gtk or kde/qt?
[20:45] <Ditters> hi people. can someone please tell me the meaning of: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41395/
[20:45] <thndrempr> @genjusu btw what exactly is project looking glass??
[20:45] <BoomSie> I made a backup from the homedir (tar cvpn something backup.tar.gz /home) and put it back after :)
[20:45] <BoomSie> worked like a charm
[20:45] <Ax-Ax> What shall I do to get my Soundblaster Live! 5.1 Dell oem to work with recording? Is there anything I can do?
[20:45] <plik> but you can always restore from backups
[20:45] <spore> nalioth, well i've been meaning to put DD-WRT or OpenWRT on my router anyway
[20:45] <crdlb> Scott0, it is on ubuntu gutsy except for unsupported videocards
[20:45] <rainwalker> lamego: if I click the "close" button on that error window, will it continue with the upgrade?

[20:47] <partymetroid> I recently installed Xubuntu 7.10 RC onto the years-old eMachine that my sister gave me after she got a new laptop.  I ran it off of the LiveCD without problems (it ran even faster than Windows XP did), and it installed just fine.  I can even access the ext3 filesystem, and read/write files to it.
[20:47] <Ditters> astronouth7303 (formaly known as astro76) ... I guess you are right.

[20:50] <penguin42> partymetroid: The initrd on your hard disc is built for your machine based on your hardware; so you can have problems with either the installer not putting stuff it needs in there or other screw ups during install meaning it can't get to the initrd

[20:54] <[chr0n0s]> penguin42, have you seen it working, or guessing ?
[20:54] <tharvey> virtual text consoles don't work for some reason... I figured ubuntu disabled them?

[20:54] <hovinen> Hello all. I just upgraded to Gutsy Gibbon. When I enable 'extra' visual effects, the window borders disappear. They appear again only when I disable visual effects. Anyone know how to correct this?
[20:54] <Ashfire908> nownott: oh er sorry i forgot
[20:54] <tharvey> never mind, my bad - keyboard f-key issue
[20:54] <Eyal_D> I enabled Visual Effects on Extra. I have Leadtek nVidia 8600Gts 256Mb and I want to use the 3d Cube - How am I doing that ?
[20:54] <Scott0> it says i dont have an x server
[20:54] <Scott0> wtf
[20:54] <Scott0> what does xgl use?
[20:54] <webpirate> can someone do me a favor....can you try this link and tell me is it's slow....http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_9_linux.tar.gz
[20:54] <Ashfire908> nownott: it's echo nameserver dnsip
[20:54] <hovinen> I have tried creating a separate user account and enabling them there and the effect is the same, so it's not related to my account's configuration.
[20:54] <^Neatoo^> hey guys
[20:55] <unknown--> helo
[20:55] <secret901> hovinen: I used to have this problem.  I fixed it by reinstalling compiz

[21:01] <tharvey> I haven't found any docs on ubuntu site for 7.10 - is it b/c it just was released - should the 6.04 docs be pretty sufficient?
[21:01] <^Neatoo^> is amarok only for kde ?

[21:05] <astro76> sivik, try running tvtime
[21:06] <newguy> hey there im having a very weird issue regarding fglrx *i think*, ive got compiz-fusion and everything running smoothly but when i enter glxgears i get this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41393/  can someone explain this to me thanks
[21:06] <sivik> astro76, let me install it first
[21:06] <astro76> Blama, for what version Ubuntu?
[21:06] <hhaamu> why does the "put display to sleep when inactive for" slider in power management have the minimum value of 11 minutes?
[21:06] <rainwalker> what is the gutsy irc channel?
[21:06] <skriv> after logging into the gui, it hangs after password....but I can log in to the console fine.  Is this a vid driver problem or xorg config?
[21:06] <Blama> astro76, Gutsy
[21:06] <penguin42> partymetroid: That sounds OK, I can't see anything particularly wrong - do you have a digital camera? Could you get a screen shot of the page with the boot errors onto a website somewhere?
[21:06] <astro76> rainwalker, this is it
[21:06] <mythril> what is the simplest way to set up the peerguardian (or equivalent) block lists in ubuntu (7.10)?
[21:06] <penguin42> rainwalker: You've found it!
[21:06] <rainwalker> oh
[21:06] <karel> thedonvaughn: I heard something about new drivers when amd took over, is that just an upgrade to the fglrx?
[21:06] <dystopianray> newguy: i don't think 3d programs are supposed to work properly when you're using xgl
[21:06] <JarG0n> what command do I use to take ownership of a filesystem?
[21:06] <rainwalker> I wondered why #ubuntu+1 wasn't doing anything
[21:06] <sivik> astro76, its working, now i just have to figure out how to record
[21:07] <rainwalker> well then
[21:07] <Mith36> Hi, I have a radoen x1800xt and 7.10.  Anytime I run fglrxinfo from the terminal, I crash to my login screen.  I searched through my syslog and found this WARNING: gdm_slave_xioerror_handler: Fatal X error - Restarting :0.  Could the two be possibly related?  Any suggestions?
[21:07] <astro76> Blama, yeah I see it wasn't updated
[21:07] <linos> astro76:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41404/
[21:07] <Ax-Ax> What shall I do to get my Soundblaster Live! 5.1 Dell oem to work with recording? Is there anything I can do? If i try recording with Audacity it just says: Error while opening sound device. Please check the input device settings and the project sample rate.
[21:07] <partymetroid> Als, penguin42: it didn't say that the initrd was corrupt: "invalid compressed format (err=2)"
[21:07]  * penguin42 hands rianwalker an umbrella
[21:07] <hhaamu> tritium: I sort of agree, but I keep mistaking the new menu bar as the application menu bar.
[21:07] <rainwalker> astro76: Do I need to disable mulitverse/universe before upgrading?
[21:07] <thedonvaughn> newguy: that is correct.  You are running XGL i bet.  YOu can not have DRI at the same time as XGL.  One of the downfalls of ATI
[21:07] <penguin42> partymetroid: Well that doesn't sound very happy
[21:07] <Blama> astro76, Yeah, it's annoying... I downlaoded teh newest version amnually but I can't figure out how to make it work

[21:07] <astro76> linos, and the output of mount ?
[21:08] <thedonvaughn> rainwalker: since gutsy was released, #ubuntu+1 forwards to here.
[21:08] <newguy> ok, what would i need DRI for?
[21:08] <newguy> i understand xgl is needed for compiz etc
[21:08] <dystopianray> newguy: for 3d acceleration
[21:08] <hhaamu> how do I make the v^ buttons in scroll bars above each other? (much better in laptop usage that way)
[21:08] <newguy> weird
[21:08] <lgc__> lamego, astronouth7303, I did my RTFM chores: "gpg --symmetric file -> file.gpg ; gpg --decrypt file.gpg" and voila! I can even interchange the file between different machines as long as I don't forget the passphrase.
[21:08] <partymetroid> penguin42: I already gave the full error messagges. (I wrote them down).  So, taking a screenshot would be pointless...
[21:08] <thedonvaughn> newguy: games, etc etc...
[21:08] <penguin42> partymetroid: SO there are no errors before that?

[21:09] <thedonvaughn> newguy: if you disabled XGL, you'd have DRI again
[21:09] <secret901> anyone know how to fix a problem with the wireless card not connecting to the network after a suspend?
[21:09] <dystopianray> newguy: blame ATI for their crap drivers

[21:10] <seanh> I have apache and pyblosxom installed on my laptop and run a blog locally. Obviously I can edit and view this blog without being connected to the Internet, because it's on my own computer. But when I am not connected to the Internet, epiphany will refuse to open some pages of the blog, local files, because it says it is "Working offline." Other pages epiphany will take from its cache, so recent changes will not be seen, it w
[21:10] <seanh> ill not re-read the local file until I connect to the Internet. Is there any way round this? Or should I file a bug report?
[21:10] <newguy> what specs are they penguin? link?
[21:10] <newguy> is this for a newer driver?
[21:10] <comicinker> newguy: ATI itself suffers from weird contracts, it not their fault
[21:10] <thndrempr> @genjutsu i tried booting from the ubuntu live cd again
[21:10] <yasper> hi can i get some help with my dell sound driver please
[21:10] <penguin42> newguy: Apparently they released the programming details of some of thei hardware so some guys will be able to start writing free drivers
[21:10] <linos> astro76: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41405/
[21:10] <Andycasss> As im a newbie, i dont know which script to write...
[21:10] <Blama> astro76, It says to install by useing "./azureus" but I get the error, "bash: ./azureus: Permission denied" so I did "sudo ./azureus" and got "sudo: ./azureus: command not found"
[21:11] <newguy> ahh ok, hope something gets released soon :S
[21:11] <genjutsu> @thndrempr how was it?
[21:11] <ralph_> ok I followed the instructions like ubotu said, libdvdread3 was already installed so i reinstalled it..and then when i try to use the terminal command it says "command not found" anyone know what i am doing wrong?
[21:11] <partymetroid> seanh: did you try to go to "localhost"?
[21:11] <dystopianray> newguy: don't expect anything for a year or more
[21:11] <thedonvaughn> Mith36: if you want help, i suggest you give way more detail in your question and be more specific.  Something doesn't work is hardly descrptive.
[21:11] <penguin42> newguy: But it does mean they are being helpful
[21:11] <irotas> has anyone gotten and acx wireless card working on 7.10? my linksys pcmcia card no longer works after upgrading
[21:11] <newguy> otherwise im going to sell my ATI for an NVIDIA card, speaking of NVIDIA how well do those cards run with Gutsy?
[21:11] <usser> Andycasss: what are u trying to do?
[21:11] <thedonvaughn> newguy: just as well as any other linux distro.   so better than ATI? :)
[21:12] <newguy> sweet
[21:12] <dystopianray> newguy: ati should be releasing a new driver within days that supports aiglx so it may pay to wait
[21:12] <irotas> it seems like acx driver support is busted on 7.10
[21:12] <newguy> ah ok, ill hang in for a bit then
[21:12] <jdong> dystopianray: within days might be a bit overly optimistic
[21:12] <seanh> partymetroid: well, the url was 127.0.0.1/path
[21:12] <Blama> astro76, It says to install by useing "./azureus" but I get the error, "bash: ./azureus: Permission denied" so I did "sudo ./azureus" and got "sudo: ./azureus: command not found"
[21:12] <thndrempr> @genjutu i tried running it from the cd
[21:12] <jdong> but yes, relatively soon we shoudl get fglrx 8.42
[21:12] <rainwalker> this is by far the most complicated upgrade I've gone through
[21:12] <thndrempr> @genjutu and i used -noapic as u said
[21:12] <thedonvaughn> Blama: chmod +x ./azureus
[21:13] <thndrempr> @genjutu but i still got a missing driver error

[21:13] <genjutsu> @thndrempr i'll check on my notes
[21:13] <astro76> linos, hmm I'm not sure, try mkfs.ext3 instead of mkfs -t ext3 (but it should be the same, mkfs is a frontend to the different mkfs.*)

[21:13] <rainwalker> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41406/
[21:13] <thndrempr> @genjutu anyway the initialisation continued..
[21:13] <astro76> linos, also you could try booting a  live cd and doing it there
[21:13] <usser> Andycasss: pretty much the same goes for linux
[21:13] <thndrempr> @genjutu it said loading gui and the screen froze..
[21:13] <thndrempr> @genjutu k.. thanks

[21:24] <linos> astro76: can I use the ubuntu 6.10 cd?
[21:24] <FF29> just wondering what that means
[21:24] <astro76> fusspawn, df -h
[21:24] <astro76> linos, yeah
[21:24] <usser> Andycasss: and change the server name and mount point accordingly
[21:25] <BBking> franixe_: Thanks, before I forget it.
[21:25] <linos> astro76: cool, I'll try it now
[21:25] <astro76> linos, or gparted livecd or system rescue cd are small downloads
[21:25] <Azzco> What's the difference between syslinux and isolinux?
[21:25] <end0r57> hello
[21:25] <linos> astro76: ok
[21:25] <Ace2016> thanks
[21:25] <astro76> linos, but yeah it's fine
[21:25] <astro76> just to run mkfs
[21:25] <FF29> so what is a busy box error
[21:25] <fusspawn> http://pastebin.ca/743840
[21:25] <fusspawn> mount output
[21:25] <berlylabs> anyone here good with ubuntu and wireless cards
[21:26] <Rugxulo> Azzco, seems syslinux is floppy and isolinux is CD-ROM
[21:26] <fusspawn> http://pastebin.ca/index.phpWould ti be teh fact im running Wubi /
[21:26] <Kaitlyn2004> im installing ubuntu on my laptop. I already have the 7.04 cd.. is there ANY diff between installing that and upgrading versus installing 7.10 fresh?
[21:26] <end0r57> where are compiz themes installed?
[21:26] <volk> anyone here using mail-notification program? (tray icon that shows you when new mail arrives)
[21:26] <fusspawn> err dunno how the link got involved there "would it be the fact i installed using Wubi"
[21:26] <secret901> Kaitlyn2004: use fresh to avoid problems
[21:26] <astro76> fusspawn, I'd say that is a strong possibility
[21:26] <fusspawn> Bleh
[21:26] <astro76> fusspawn, I can't imagine it's well tested
[21:26] <end0r57> can't get any new themes to appear in the dialog box for window decorations
[21:26] <berlylabs> Kaitlyn: u can do what I did, do updates and once your up to date it will tell u u can upgrade
[21:26] <fusspawn> but then how come the folders above it show as normal free space
[21:26] <berlylabs> it's easier than adisk
[21:26] <astro76> fusspawn, you should install for real ;) (dual boot is ok)
[21:27] <fusspawn> its just anything under /home doesnt
[21:27] <irotas> berlylabs: you said you're having wireless problems?
[21:27] <Sp0tUb> How to install VLC?

[21:27] <deadchip> does Gutsy come with any virtualization system preconfigured?
[21:27] <astro76> fusspawn, well in your paste there is a separate virtual partition for /home
[21:27] <_-XPERT-_> Sp0tUb: apt-get install vlc from a command line
[21:27] <irotas> berlylabs: acx-based wireless cards are broken in gutsy
[21:27] <Sp0tUb> Thx
[21:27] <fusspawn> Yeah but ive got data on both ym current partions i cant afford to lose, and i know my luck astra
[21:27] <deadchip> or one that would be best suited for installation
[21:27] <usser> Andycasss: and then if u want the script to run at startup just put it into /usr/share/autostart
[21:27] <fusspawn> Ahh
[21:27] <_-XPERT-_> do this as root
[21:27] <partymetroid> I'm leaving.  Thanks for the help.... bye.
[21:27] <fusspawn> anyway to fix that ?
[21:27] <h4writer> Hi, got a problem. Now everything works just fine, until I want to try 'nvidia binary driver'. I install it through restricted manager, but when I restart I go to Safe Mode and no configuration let my screen work. How can I solve that, I really want to try compiz. (I upgraded from 7.04 and in 7.04 I installed Nvidia through envy, maybe that's the problem?)
[21:27] <astro76> fusspawn, not a clue
[21:27] <_-XPERT-_> so "sudo apt-get install vlc"
[21:27] <berlylabs> irotas: could they have worked in feisty?
[21:27] <yasper> can someone help me getting sound on dell with gutsy gibbon please
[21:27] <irotas> berlylabs: don't know if that applies to you, but maybe it does
[21:27] <P0larBear> i cannot get my laptop to work in 1280x800 with gutsy
[21:27] <nakanaka> Kaitlyn2004: you'll be much better off installing it fresh. the update usually goes well but sometimes there are problems
[21:27] <erin> Hi again. I just installed Gutsy, and I'm getting an Error 22: No such partition after selecting the kernel.
[21:27] <fusspawn> Hmm.

[21:28] <irotas> berlylabs: execute 'dmesg |grep acx' and see if it's mentioned
[21:28] <irotas> berlylabs: if it is, you're affected
[21:28] <FredThompson> +
[21:28] <astro76> fusspawn, yeah it's pretty new, I don't think it's worth it, and shrinking your ntfs to install linux is safe... of course you should have a backup anyway!

[21:45] <penguin42> rohan: Install the got-core package
[21:45] <arang2> kale: totem uses 30% of processor when using h.264 so it isnt a processor issue i repeat it isnt a processor issue

[21:53] <Dekkard> berylabs..  i wish i could help more.. im afraid i cant.. but you may want to try to find just a generic driver for your cards chip.. i.e atheros etc
[21:53] <sivik> Skelet0n, go to #bcm-users channel and talk in there, they helped me
[21:53] <Noble> penguin42: i think it worked too

[21:55] <erin> penguin42: well, when I installed, I put linux on SDB.
[21:55] <Pici> DG19075: search for studio in the repos, theres a whole bunch of packages
[21:55] <sistom> Anyone?
[21:55] <Pici> DG19075: Some of them are the art/theme packages
[21:55] <DaRkSkye> is there any documentation that I can read on the subject?  anyone?
[21:55] <sivik> saloxin, go into #bcm-users, they can help you with the 43xx drivers
[21:55] <Skelet0n> sivik: can u join that?
[21:55] <penguin42> erin: So I think you need to swap the sda and sdb in device.map; I think that will fix it next time grub gets reinstalled - I'm just not sure if you also are going to have to swap menu.lst or whether that is like a double swap

[21:58] <ohad> using usb?.
[21:58] <Skelet0n> ^
[21:58] <DaRkSkye> mofo: how?
[21:58] <sivik> Skelet0n, then there is something wrong with you irc
[21:58] <astro76> !paste | Skelet0n
[21:58] <mofo> so you don't know how to switch desktops via cube thing
[21:58] <ubotu> Skelet0n: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[21:58] <sivik> i'm in it
[21:58] <mofo> check your net settings
[21:58] <Foxdie> I think gutsy is a little bugged
[21:58] <mofo> make sure you have a DNS server up
[21:58] <berlylabs> #bcm-users is a channel?
[21:58] <sivik> Skelet0n, Now talking on #bcm-users
[21:58] <penguin42> erin: I think changing the device.map will only change things for a grub update, not for your next reboot
[21:58] <satorious> sound doesn't work at all! i have no idea what's causing it. what should i do to start diagnosing the problem?
[21:58] <sivik> berlylabs, yes
[21:58] <mofo> it should come automatically from your ISP
[21:58] <We3Share> How do I permanently mount a hard-drive? I switched over from windows and I had a second HD that was NTFS...I used G-Parted to format it ext3, now how do I make Ubuntu mount it and automount it on boot?
[21:58] <DaRkSkye> mofo: everything looks fine, everything that I know to get ot
[21:58] <penguin42> erin: I think what will get it working immediately is changing the menu.lst once you get it to boot
[21:58] <satorious> sound stopped wroking just after reconfiguring x.org, i should say.
[21:58] <Foxdie> We3Share: add it to /etc/fstab
[21:58] <mofo> other than that, unplug your modem wait 10 secs then plug it in again
[21:58] <beernutz> saloxin, ya.  just not sure how to USE the restricted hardware applet, when i need the -server kernel.  it wont run and complains about the restricted drivers package
[21:58] <sistom> ??????
[21:58] <sistom> Anyone in here installed grsecurity on their computer?
[21:59] <erin> penguin42: What should I change in Menu.lst?
[21:59] <mofo> if you're not connected to the net, how are you on here?
[21:59] <sivik> penguin42, what should i try about my NIC
[21:59] <We3Share> Foxdie: How do I know what hda it is?
[21:59] <sistom> Maybe a second computer?
[21:59] <mofo> hey everyone, first time *nix user here, and I want all the cool desktop stuff
[21:59] <penguin42> erin: The (hd1's to (hd0's  like you are doing on the grub edit
[21:59] <rakyr> i need some advice on what to do with my computers for servers.  PM me
[21:59] <mofo> where do I start?
[21:59] <Skelet0n> got it sivik
[21:59] <mofo> google didn't really help btw
[21:59] <Skelet0n> tks
[21:59] <penguin42> sinik: I'm not sure, I don't know that particular model
[21:59] <Foxdie> mount it manually and see what files are on it? ;)
[21:59] <saloxin> beernutz: why you need the -server kernel?
[21:59] <DaRkSkye> mofo: I am surfing now just fine.  XP hits it fine, even my dual boot to vista on the same machine hits hine, just not in ubuntu
[21:59] <erin> penguin42: Okay, rebooting
[21:59] <beernutz> saloxin, i need the server kernel to see all of my box.  i have quad dual core opterons with 16 gig of ram
[21:59] <We3Share> Foxdie: It is totally blank. I just formatted it in gparted.
[21:59] <Foxdie> "fdisk -l" (l for Lemur) will list all partitions on the system
[21:59] <mofo> hmmmm....
[21:59] <mofo> I just loaded ubuntu for the first time today
[21:59] <saloxin> oooo nice
[22:00] <mofo> I'm trying to get beryl and feisty on here
[22:00] <satorious> sound stopped wroking just after reconfiguring x.org. what could the problem be?
[22:00] <penguin42> beernutz: Have you got it to work (even not seeing all of your box) with the standard kernel?
[22:00] <DaRkSkye> why fiesty?
[22:00] <mofo> I dont' really understand too much the deb and apt command phylosophy right now
[22:00] <We3Share> Foxdie: fdisk -l -- not returning anything
[22:00] <beernutz> saloxin, ya, but a pain now.
[22:00] <Creepindacellar> ok i'm hooked
[22:00] <beernutz> penguin42, have not tried.  it was all working in the feisty release with the -server kernel
[22:00] <We3Share> Foxdie: It's not a partition it is a complete second hd.
[22:00] <linos> astro76: will this do.. /dev/hda2:UUID="6d01b5b3-d04f-4ccb-b732-83f5acdd3dd0" SEC_TYPE="ext2" TYPE="ext3"
[22:00] <penguin42> mofo: deb is mostly about individual packages, apt is more about dependencies between packages and fetching them from repositories
[22:00] <pizux> hello is someon could tall me if 7.10 is out for ppc and xhere to get it pleae?
[22:00] <erin> penguin42: Yeah, I had to edit boot again to boot up. should I edit menu.lst now?
[22:00] <beernutz> it all went to hell after the upgrade
[22:01] <penguin42> beernutz: Nod, it might be worth a try
[22:01] <astro76> linos, yeah replace the xxxxxxx with 6d01b5b3-d04f-4ccb-b732-83f5acdd3dd0
[22:01] <Foxdie> We3Share: it'll still be a partition, even if its just one large one
[22:01] <ubuntu_> Hello, I cant install Gusty, halfway the instalation ubuntu shuts down ejects the cd and asks for reboot and now the grub is all wrong and I cant access windows...
[22:01] <saloxin> beernutz: sounds like you should be able to afford proper wireless cards
[22:01] <penguin42> erin: Yeh I'd edit menu.lst
[22:01] <Foxdie> unless you haven't partitioned it yet
[22:01] <DaRkSkye> I am fairly new too.  I was just getting into it when the net just stopped working
[22:01] <Skelet0n> i need help setting up my wireless network, anyone?
[22:01] <beernutz> saloxin, what does wireless have to do with nvidia?
[22:01] <djlenoir> hello everyone. i just finished reloading my pc with 7.10 and was really hoping that my bluetooth woes would be over in this version. i have this keyboard and mouse http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=dhs&cs=19&sku=310-8142 but they are not getting identified by the OS. i am also using a PS/2 keyboard and mouse right now to troubleshoot. when i boot up the system, the little bluetooth icon is showing in the up
[22:01] <erin> penguin42: Okay,, looking
[22:01] <beernutz> i was not asking about wireless
[22:01] <mofo> thanks!
[22:01] <mofo> I got that from a guide I was skimming over
[22:01] <linos> astro76:  do I need the /dev/hda2 in front?
[22:01] <mofo> but, how do I install beryl and feisty for the cool desktop stuff
[22:02] <saloxin> beernutz: oh. my confusion
[22:02] <penguin42> erin:  If that boots then edit the device.map and if it ever breaks again try putting the menu.lst back; oh - and please bug report it with details of your machine
[22:02] <Adam> is there a way to refresh usb devices?
[22:02] <astro76> linos, just replace the xxxxxxx with 6d01b5b3-d04f-4ccb-b732-83f5acdd3dd0 in my paste, and that's your new fstab
[22:02] <janerik> WIRELESS. Tried searching for my problem that the strength of the signal is not showing... ANYONE PLEASE
[22:02] <DaRkSkye> mofo: why don't you install gusty?  it has Compiz already installed with all the cool stuff!!
[22:02] <bruenig> !caps | janerik
[22:02] <ubotu> janerik: PLEASE DON'T SHOUT! We can read lowercase too.
[22:02] <linos> astro76: gotcha now
[22:02] <beernutz> saloxin, np.  is there a way to get or fake in install of the restricted drivers package for -server?
[22:02] <mofo> ok
[22:02] <mofo> can you give me the command line for that?
[22:02] <mofo> for the deb
[22:02] <erin> penguin42: Okay, trying
[22:02] <bruenig> janerik, does iwlist scan show you?
[22:02] <wildintellect_> looking for what packages contain the ipw wireless drivers
[22:03] <DaRkSkye> mofo: what video card do you have?
[22:03] <mofo> 7900
[22:03] <mofo> nvidia
[22:03] <DaRkSkye> yeah, you will be good
[22:03] <rohan> i had previously edited my .vimrc, which i lost. now i longer have the feature of dynamically adjusting tab lengths depending on the file currently being edited
=== InfiL00p_Laptop is now known as InfiL00p
[22:03] <rohan> i.e. if a certain file uses 8 spaces as tab, and other uses 2, pressing enter key on previous line automatically took me to two places on the next line
[22:03] <rohan> now however it just takes me to the beginning of line
[22:03] <janerik> bruenig: yes
[22:03] <ff29> penguin42: i have encounterd a new problem
[22:03] <henke> are there any reported problems with gutsy install images, that even though written perfectly to the cd, the installer fails to read some files?
[22:03] <rohan> any idea how do i get the original behaviour back ?
[22:03] <bruenig> janerik, ok so it is a problem with the front end then, no big deal
[22:03] <DaRkSkye> once you install, go to system-administration-restricted drivers manager and install the nvidia drivers, and on reboot all the cool stuff will be working
[22:03] <penguin42> ff29: Which is?
[22:04] <henke> I get lots of media errors, but I'm quite sure that the cd device is fine
[22:04] <saloxin> beernutz: you could try module-assistant
[22:04] <ohad>  (brltty) did not claim interface 0 before use
[22:04] <rohan> henke: did you verify the md5sum ? i did not experience such a problem
[22:04] <beernutz> is that a command or a package?
[22:04] <henke> rohan: they verify properly
[22:04] <ff29> penquin42: the boot disc boot menu doesnt let me do anything, it appears but when i hit enter nothing happens
[22:04] <saloxin> beernutz: a package giving you a command
[22:04] <ff29> penguin42: the boot disc boot menu doesnt let me do anything, it appears but when i hit enter nothing happens

[22:04] <DaRkSkye> please help with troubleshooting network issue: intranet fine, no internet, wired or wireless, only in ubuntu, windows is fine
[22:04] <beernutz> ill look at that.
[22:04] <astro76> linos, actually this one sorry http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41425/  ... but it's just a comment change so the other one is technially correct
[22:05] <penguin42> beernutz: I'm curious actually; looking at the generic kernel I have here it looks like the defualt has 8 CPUs - so what don't you see on your machine on the default?
[22:05] <feklee> How do I start the power management preferences from the CLI?
[22:05] <beernutz> the ram
[22:05] <DG19075> I just installed the ubuntustudio-look package, but the window borderlooks more like the Gilouche theme, in black, than the snazzy Vista-like stuff under 7.04. What to do now?
[22:05] <ff29> penguin42: i put the cd in my freinds computer and it worked fine
[22:05] <penguin42> ff29: Hmm
[22:05] <erin> penguin42: Holy cats! There's a lot of options here. Would you mind looking at a pastebin of it?
[22:05] <beernutz> penguin42, it will not see all the ram i have
[22:05] <penguin42> erin: Sure
[22:05] <DaRkSkye> please help with troubleshooting network issue: intranet fine, no internet, wired or wireless, only in ubuntu, windows is fine
[22:05] <beernutz> 16 gig
[22:05] <speaker219> Wow the ubuntu repos are really slow...i wonder why :p
[22:05] <rohan> DG19075: revert the theme back to how you want it ?

[22:05] <DaRkSkye> please help with troubleshooting network issue: intranet fine, no internet, wired or wireless, only in ubuntu, windows is fine
[22:05] <penguin42> beernutz: Ah that's a bit nutty
[22:06] <ubuntu_> COuld someone help me with a installation problem? how do I pass the noapic and noalpic parameters before I start installing
[22:06] <DaRkSkye> can anyone assist me?
[22:06] <satorious> I'm trying to fix a sound problem. I have an Audigy sound card, but alsamixer shows it trying to use some nvidia thing with the onboard sound chipset. How can I change the default sound device to be the Audigy?
[22:06] <beernutz> penguin42, ya, you would think it would have the ram if it had the cpu's
[22:06] <penguin42> beernutz: I suspect the generic 64bit kernel would see it

[22:09] <Dumptruck> ?
[22:09] <axisys_> my home dir is about 30G .. what is the best way to transfer it to another system on same private netwok? nc or star ?
[22:09] <fuligin> saloxin, i can see networks, its just i cant connect to them
[22:09] <ff29> iv decided im just not ment to run ubuntu or linux in general on my laptop
[22:09] <franixe_> DUUUUUDE: are you having trouble accessing the file.....what exactly is stopping you editing it
[22:09] <penguin42> axisys: rsync
[22:09] <erin> penguin42: Hmm... Well, I'll change those hd1 lines first
[22:10] <axisys_> penguin42: about 30G?
[22:10] <comicinker> Dumptruck: should work out of the box. what system are you using?
[22:10] <axisys_> penguin42: does rsync offer threading ?
[22:10] <DanMulvey> WHen I shut down my laptop, it doesn't turn completely off...is there a reason why?
[22:10] <rohan> ubuntu_: hmm ? strange
[22:10] <DG19075> I guess there's not much i can do to get the Ubuntu Studio window borders back to where thry were under 7.04 then...
[22:10] <Dumptruck> 7.04
[22:10] <Phil> Dumptruck: should be able to just work depending on your fstab
[22:10] <penguin42> axisys_: Yeh should be OK, no rsync doesn't do threading - might take a while
[22:10] <rohan> DG19075: no, atleast not automatically
[22:10] <DUUUUUDE> i uninstalled an application, but the short cut is still in Applications menu
[22:10] <Dumptruck> and have NTFS-3g installed
[22:10] <KanGar> where can i get help on /dev/usblp0?
[22:10] <Dumptruck> cp: cannot create regular file `/media/disk/boot.ini': Read-only file system
[22:10] <Phil> anyone know what user/group samba runs as?
[22:10] <slackern> satorious: i don't have an audigy card myself so not too familiar with them, it should be at the bottom where you select device, and which mixer tracks should be used for that device, maybe something special with those cards that im not to sure about =/
[22:10] <rohan> DanMulvey: yes, does your laptop support ACPI ?
[22:10] <comicinker> Dumptruck: get the ntfs-3g packet
=== toby is now known as crazytobster
[22:11] <axisys_> penguin42: so it should be faster than netcat or star .. i think star offers threading
[22:11] <ubuntu_> rohan: right, any way I can see the shutdonw logs to see if I can find the problem?
[22:11] <rohan> ubuntu_: not now, because you used the livecd
[22:11] <peepsalot> penguin42, hey, i restarted, i was having trouble getting into my desktop (without failsafe gnome).  which dot files should I get rid of?  should i rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gnome_private ?
[22:11] <comicinker> help: kdenlive doesn't recognise 16:9 dv movies, they are displayed as 4:3. but totem shows them as 16:9, what could be the problem in kdenlive?
[22:11] <penguin42> axisys: Netcat by itself just does the connection; 30GB isn't that much these days :-)
[22:11] <speaker219> Is there any way to control the brightness via Xorg (like gamma tweaking etc) Like a gamma control panel would work on windows?
[22:11] <ubuntu_> rohan: anyway I can fix my Previous GRUB from the live cd
[22:11] <ff29> penguin42: i just got an error the box says boot loader and the message is "/casper/vmlinuz
[22:11] <Dumptruck> get the ntfs-3g packet - already done
[22:12] <penguin42> peepsalot: Yeh I'd go for all of those - but instead of rm'ing them move them into another directory in case you want bits of them
[22:12] <Dumptruck> still same error message
[22:12] <speaker219> Is there any way to control the brightness via Xorg (like gamma tweaking etc) Like a gamma control panel would work on windows?
[22:12] <DUUUUUDE> i uninstalled an application, but the shortcut is still in Applications menu
[22:12] <slaytanic> axisys_: nfs?
[22:12] <ff29> i feel like a n00b even though iv used linux b4
[22:12] <Sp0tUb> !intergradet webcam
[22:12] <rohan> ubuntu_: well, why don't you just start the install overagain ?
[22:12] <blix_> How do I get involved in Ubuntu development?
[22:12] <DUUUUUDE> how do i delete the shortcut?
[22:12] <pike_> speaker219: you can just xgamma -gamma .4 or whatever 1 is current
[22:12] <DanMulvey> rohan: how do i find that out?
[22:12] <comicinker> Dumptruck: and install a configuration tool for ntfs-3g
[22:12] <ubuntu_> rohan: I've done that like 3 times already :'(
[22:12] <blix_> like what languages is Ubuntu written in?
[22:12] <erin> penguin42: I made the changes, but I don't understand that stuff about map and all that. By the way, I made a backupcopy of the original and new version of this.
[22:12] <blix_> C++?
[22:13] <Sp0tUb> How do i get my intergrated webcam to work in Ubuntu?
[22:13] <Dumptruck> comicinker - hmmm not sure
[22:13] <franixe_> blix_ : Russian
[22:13] <axisys_> slaytanic: nfs would be faster than netcat or star ? i want something that offers threading maybe or multiple chnl from data transfer
[22:13] <ubuntu_> rohan: each time it advances further into the instalation before shutting down
[22:13] <blix_> Russia?
[22:13] <penguin42> erin: I think it is trying to do something clever to swap the discs around before it boots Windows - but I'm wondering if that is what is confusing it in the first place; but I suspect not
[22:13]  * franixe_ was being an idiot
[22:13] <comicinker> Dumptruck: sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
[22:13] <blix_> mmm
[22:13] <slaytanic> axisys_: Well, it's pretty fast. 30gb ain't that much data anyways.
[22:13] <bruenig> blix_, ubuntu is simply a collection of other software, it has a few homemade python scripts incorporated but that's it, it doesn't develop, it packages other development
[22:13] <speaker219> Pike_ i don't really mean gamma, on windows there was a way to control the brightness, but i think it was doing something else, e.g. it was not done via the graphics card. This is the program i used on windows http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Video-Tweak/Gamma-Panel.shtml and it runs in wine but i'm looking for an all-linux solution.
[22:13] <bonna> ciao a tutti
[22:13] <blix_> I'll just read the help pages for now
[22:13] <erin> penguin42: What would happen if I erased those lines?
[22:14] <void^> blix_: the kernel is mostly C. applications are coded in whatever language the developer fancied at the time.
[22:14] <slaytanic> blix_: Lot's of 'em.
[22:14] <blix_> right ok thanks bruenig
[22:14] <justin420> can anybody help me getting 1680x1050 resolution with dvd-d using a nvidia 6800gs on gutsy?
[22:14] <erin> penguin42: Or commented them out
[22:14] <Dumptruck> E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[22:14] <Dumptruck> E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[22:14] <penguin42> erin: Not sure - something would be more or less confused :-) But I suspect they are irrelevant to the problem of booting Linux
[22:14] <blix_> I'll come back later
[22:14] <bruenig> Dumptruck, close synaptic
[22:14] <speaker219> Dumptruck: you...yeah
[22:14] <blix_> ah yeah..
[22:14] <blix_> need some tips folsk
[22:14] <JohnRobert> I have a laptop running gutsy...it has eth1 (wireless) that I use, but I intend to hook up a PC to eth0 (wired ethernet) to it.... how would I 'join' the pc to my wireless network via the laptop - what should I be looking for, and would it be possible to do this without turning off/ruining network manager?
[22:14] <Dumptruck> oops
[22:14] <blix_> actually no I don;t
[22:14] <speaker219> So any solution to the brightness problem?
[22:14] <comicinker> yeah
[22:14] <Dumptruck> actually I already have it
[22:14] <DrVali> Ive got an atheros 5006eg card that does not work under ubuntu 7.10.  I'm running the amd64 version.  Anyone know if this card can be made to work - and if so - do you have a link to a page that I can read?
[22:14] <erin> penguin42: So, how about I comment them out and reboot it?
[22:14] <peepsalot> penguin42, any other things I should move?
[22:14] <penguin42> speaker219: I think it really is gamma you want
[22:14] <axisys_> slaytanic: well i like to see which one get me faster datat transfer..
[22:15] <speaker219> It's not. trust me.
[22:15] <slaytanic> axisys_: Do a benchmark, then.
[22:15] <penguin42> peepsalot: See if those work, if they don't then try .gconf and .gconfd
[22:15] <peepsalot> ok
[22:15] <ohad> does anyone know how to resolve this
[22:15] <ohad> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":1.0".
[22:15] <peepsalot> time to restart
[22:15] <fuligin> Dr vali, ive got a similar problem too :(
[22:15] <pike_> speaker219: xgamma command
[22:15] <Dumptruck> already had both installed when I got this error: cp: cannot create regular file `/media/disk/boot.ini': Read-only file system
[22:15] <comicinker> Dumptruck: so there must be a configuration tool in your menu- look for it and if you cant find it, enable it by editing the menu
[22:15] <tomd123> Can anyone help me getting my Custom Function buttons working on my sony laptop, I'm running 7.10
[22:15] <DaRkSkye> saloxin: I posted it, sorry it took so long
[22:15] <pike_> speaker219: im sure there is a front end though for that stuff
[22:15] <axisys_> slaytanic: yep.. but dont u think if i could have multiple channels that will make the transfer faster?
[22:16] <B_166-ER-X> !sound

[22:21] <fm3> zer0-81: what version of vmware?
[22:21] <zer0-81> 6.01
[22:21] <saloxin> zer0-81: your vmware graphics card does not support the video extension..
[22:21] <peepsalot> penguin42, so I doubt the problem is any gnome-specific files

[22:23] <hydrogen> JarG0n: yes.  ubuntu includes libmtp which is a layer that programs like amarok can use
[22:23] <saloxin> DaRkSkye: what router is it?
[22:23] <computerex> Is there a sound capture program for linux?
[22:23] <penguin42> peepsalot: Odd; also look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see if there is anything then

[22:26] <don-o> jim__: thats not enough detail
[22:26] <berlylabs> citguy: says it's installed ont htat but it doesn't work
[22:26] <Cpudan80> Back2Basics: and be sure to write a nice letter to adobe berating them for not making flash for x86_64
[22:27] <berlylabs> had it working on feisty with ndis
[22:27] <Tarkus> whats more popular, and comes standard with most commonly used distros? gnome/gtk or kde/qt?
[22:27] <stiv2k> Back2Basics: you can use gnash
[22:27] <peepsalot> penguin42, any ideas?  I looked in /var/log/Xorg.0.log but don't see anything obvious.  there is a lot of crap in there though
[22:27] <stiv2k> help i just upgraded to 7.10 now 2 of my filesystems are not showing up after a reboot... trying to mount them says its either already mounted or busy, but its not mounted
[22:27] <CITguy> berlylabs: have you tried the same process as feisty?
[22:27] <penguin42> peepsalot: So you are getting the normal login screen but it only fails after login?  Have you got anything like a .xserverrc or the like in your home directory?
[22:27] <Cpudan80> Tarkus: gnome by far
[22:27] <pike_> Tarkus: gtk these days but some killer kde apps you cant do without
[22:27] <berlylabs> yes
[22:27]  * hydrogen wishes his computer would see "only 2.5 gigs" of ram
[22:27] <zer0-81> fm3: any ideas?
[22:27] <don-o> Tarkus: i dare say gnome is more popular but kde has plenty of merits
[22:27] <beernutz> penguin42, is there a way to make the -generic drivers work with -server?
[22:27] <jim__> in the terminal i type gksudo "update-manager -c -d" and then it gives me an error concerning the dbus
[22:27] <berlylabs> it says driver is installed but that the hardware isn't present
[22:27] <Cpudan80> Tarkus: suse used to hand out KDE - but they stopped doing that... so... gnome it is!
[22:27] <kode> Upgrade to 7.10 Fails: it's rebooted now, I get "Starting up ..." "Loading, please wait..." and nothing
[22:27] <berlylabs> so I believe i have the wrong driver
[22:27] <don-o> Tarkus: its a chocolate vs vanilla argument
[22:28] <Back2Basics> stiv2k, you don't have a 64 bit system do you.
[22:28] <penguin42> beernutz: Don't know
[22:28] <stiv2k> Back2Basics: not on the machine in question no
[22:28] <tomd123> I have tried gnash and imho it isn't that good as the adobe version, but you can try it out and see for yourself
[22:28] <penguin42> don-o: Have one scoop of each
[22:28] <hydrogen> Tarkus: its kind of up in the air.. try both and pick which you prefer
[22:28] <and1> I had 3 badupgrades
[22:28] <CITguy> berlylabs: does the device show up in Hardware Information?
[22:28] <don-o> penguin42: my favorite :)
[22:28] <and1> the 4th was the charm
[22:28] <Back2Basics> Cpudan80, yeah.. I signed the petition.
[22:28] <berlylabs> Anyone know where to get ndis compatible drivers for broadcom wireless cards
[22:28] <DEAthKA> try to stop first dbus daemon
[22:28] <berlylabs> yes
[22:28] <fm3> zer0-81: i assume you already tried safe mode?
[22:28] <hydrogen> as long as what you prefer is kde, alls good
[22:28]  * penguin42 disappears
[22:28] <jim__> what is the first dbus deamon
[22:28]  * don-o is a gnome fan but is very interested in kde4
[22:28] <jim__> sorry i'm a newb in ubuntu..
[22:29] <zer0-81> fm3: safemode looks like it starts, then when it should go graphical the screen blacks out
[22:29] <[chr0n0s]> how do i reduce brightness on xubuntu desktop ?
[22:29] <DEAthKA> dbus is a daemon
[22:29] <peepsalot> penguin42, that is correct, I try to login through gdm, and it changes the background color to human, with only the mouse cursor on screen. then it waits a bit, then goes back to gdm
[22:29] <zer0-81> and i get the Xlib:  extension "XFree86-VidModeExtension" missing on display ":1.0". error in the terminal window

[22:29] <berlylabs> ok new question
[22:29] <beernutz> peepsalot, i have that problem with the -generic kernel as well.
[22:29] <kode> krazykat: xubuntu, kubuntu, edubuntu
[22:29] <stiv2k> Elite: no i dont want to see every channel on the freenode network just #ubuntu ones
[22:29] <[chr0n0s]> pike_, gamma is not equal to brightness
[22:29] <fm3> berlylabs: i found my broadcom drivers via google a long time ago, ndiswrapper, broadcom, type of your card

[22:36] <kale> stiv2k: what is in /
[22:36] <fm3> berlylabs: if it's a laptop, did you make sure the rf kill switch is off
[22:36] <PhilAirtime> LifeSF: have you deleted the "it works" page? sudo rm /var/www/apache2-default/index.html
[22:36] <Terrasqu1> stiv2k: then its not sda2
[22:36] <Dumptruck>  How do I configure NTFS-3g to write to internal drives?  it does not allow me that option?
[22:36] <stiv2k> err
[22:36] <satorious> how can i get into the graphical ntfs-3g utility? the icon is no longer in the system tools menu
[22:37] <berlylabs> don-o could it mean it's not installed correctly
[22:37] <LifeSF> no i haven't
[22:37] <berlylabs> is there a way to test correct installation
[22:37] <LifeSF> but i had added a directory in www
[22:37] <don-o> berlylabs: if it werent installed correctly, iwlist would give you some kind of error.
[22:37] <LifeSF> with a different website, it just doesn't work

[22:37] <don-o> berlylabs: try 'iwconfig eth1' to see how the wifi is currently configured
[22:37] <rabsteen> does anyone when the latest firefox will be added to the repo?
[22:37] <stiv2k> kale: yeah my bad its sda1
[22:38] <don-o> berlylabs: check for "Mode: Managed"
[22:38] <kale> so where is sda1 mounted, according to mount command?

It wil say if you you're using xinerama in your xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.. Personally I do not remember how to install twinview. I only used it for a short period of time in 7.04 because compiz would not work with it for some strange reason.

[22:39] <jakub_> could you help me with some problem - where is commercial repository for gutsy gibbon ?
[22:39] <yasper> charlie_ thanks - been googling for a while - tried several solutions but no joy
[22:39] <stiv2k> kale: but it's *not* mounted
[22:39] <kale> stiv2k: i need the whole output of mount!
[22:39] <MenZa> !info gajim > Haz
[22:39] <stiv2k> ok
[22:39] <don-o> stiv2k: but /home is probably busy :)
[22:39] <DEAthKA> try unmount first
[22:39] <Reng> hey guys what is safe to delete with kleansweep??
[22:39] <andrew_> native res of the laptop monitor was picked up which is 1280x800, but there is no resolution option of 1280x1024
[22:39] <fm3> zer0-81: just as you make a normal vm, just use the iso as the cdrom drive, and boot :)
[22:39] <stiv2k> trying to unmount it says it's busy
[22:39] <pike_> andrew_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  afterwards the res will also be at bottom of file then if you have trouble
[22:40] <kale> stiv2k: or leave the /home directory!
[22:40] <PhilAirtime> jakub: deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu gutsy-commercial main

[22:40] <stiv2k> im not in the /home/ directory, kale
[22:40] <krazykat> andrew_ try selecting generic monitor and see if it appears. I'll take a gander at my xorg conf

[22:40] <stiv2k> don-o: how do i un-busy it?
[22:40] <maddler> anyone experiencing problems with grub and "vga=" options?
[22:40] <kale> stiv2k: well, pastebin output of mount
[22:40] <fm3> i need an acpi wizard
[22:40] <stiv2k> kale: ok
[22:40] <don-o> stiv2k: does /dev/sda1 show up anywhere in the output of 'mount'?
[22:40] <kale> stiv2k: fdisk -l too
[22:40] <maddler> using any vga= value only causes black screen
[22:40] <stiv2k> don-o: no
[22:40] <avi_me> how do I accomplish this without script / cat <file pattern> ?
[22:41] <don-o> stiv2k: try 'fuser /home'
[22:41] <berlylabs> don-o: ok so I learned something
[22:41] <pike_> avi_me: why are you piping ls to cat?
[22:41] <don-o> berlylabs: :)
[22:41] <hydrogen> avi_me: why would you want to cat a long list?  What are you trying to accomplish
[22:41] <jfg_> I've lost internet for a while, can someone tell me if my question was answered?
[22:41] <andrew_> i tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, that restarted me at 1025,768, but still no option showing to go to a higher setting
[22:41] <berlylabs> don-o how do I know if its configured
[22:41] <don-o> berlylabs: that output, before you were unceremoniously banned, looks correct.
[22:41] <berlylabs> can I send it to you personally what it said
[22:41] <berlylabs> ok

[22:41] <andrew_> in feisty i would go into xorg.conf and add a column of the resolution i want to that one part, but that isn't showing in gutsy xorg.conf
[22:41] <eyu100> I keep getting "bad header line" errors
[22:41] <don-o> berlylabs: are you sure there is an access point in the area?
[22:41] <avi_me> I want to list the filename I'm cat'ing before I cat it
[22:41] <eyu100> when updating or upgrading
[22:41] <ompaul> berlylabs, please read the private messages you have
[22:42] <berlylabs> i saw them
[22:42] <berlylabs> sorry I didn't know
[22:42] <andrew_> but gutsy looks beautiful though i have the composite extensions running and a vista window theme :D

[22:42] <don-o> berlylabs: and have you checked what someone else mentioned about an RF kill switch?
[22:42] <stiv2k> kale: don-o: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41428/
[22:42] <krazykat> andrew_ go to... Section "Screen" in your xorg file and try adding 1280x1024 into that subsection and see if your resolution appears in your drop down menu
[22:42] <ompaul> berlylabs, and please don't use the "enter key" as punctuation ;-)
[22:42] <andrew_> ok one minute
[22:42] <berlylabs> don-o so if I were in an area with an access point, i'd get something? how would i connect to it? or would that be auto matic
[22:42] <berlylabs> and no
[22:42] <nownott> im trying to get a web server setup and i cant seem to get http working out side of my network
[22:42] <nownott> i have this rule setup ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            tcp dpt:www
[22:42] <zerokill> krazykat: i beleive im using xinerama but let me check the conf. however befour compiz worked i could dual screen without a problem. i installed xgl and then compiz worked for both screens but with the problem i mentioned. with a single sceen i would compiz without problems without xgl.
[22:43] <nownott> but still no go outside of my network
[22:43] <don-o> berlylabs: ubuntu is supposed to make that easy.
[22:43] <avi_me> ok , what I want to do is look inside a bunch of files for a specfic line and if it's there i want to know the filename, grep <pattern> <files> does not show me the filenames
[22:43] <berlylabs> so it should just connect automatically
[22:43] <don-o> stiv2k: okay so forget home for the moment. mkdir /tmp/test ; mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/test
[22:43] <saloxin> nownott: router issue? you need to port forward in your gateway or something?
[22:43] <andrew_> krazykat: i see a section called "modes" should i add it under the only mode showing, which is 1280x800.  also should i make a backup of this file before i do this and how do i do taht
[22:43] <kousotu> where does one fine emerald themes/
[22:43] <krazykat> andrew_ you could also try selecting with with 'dpkg-reconifgure xserver-xorg' and do it through the promt
[22:43] <saloxin> nownott: is the box nat'ed?
[22:43] <kale> stiv2k: # fdisk -l
[22:43] <nownott> already did that i have it setup to do ssh and http
[22:43] <berlylabs> don-o in feisty I could have it enabled even when I didn't have a signal I can't do that here
[22:43] <berlylabs> for some reason
[22:44] <stiv2k> kale: check the pastebin
[22:44] <andrew_> i got stuck in that prompt, not sure eaxctly where
[22:44] <nownott> saloxin: dont believe so
[22:44] <hinogi> hello guys, i got some serious wlan network issues since gutsy
[22:44] <saloxin> nownott: and ssh works but htpp not?
[22:44] <stiv2k> don-o: steve@galatea:/$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/test/
[22:44] <stiv2k> mount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /tmp/test/ busy
[22:44] <nownott> saloxin:  yes
[22:44] <hinogi> i can't manually establish a connect
[22:44] <kale> stiv2k: you ran fdisk as a regular user, run it as root
[22:44] <hinogi> only the auto connect on startup works
[22:44] <don-o> berlylabs: im not sure what you mean by 'enabled', but it looks good from my point of view.
[22:44] <andrew_> this is just different for me because of this dual monitor support
[22:44] <stiv2k> kale: ok
[22:44] <zer0-81> fm3: no video still...
[22:44] <hinogi> and even so the network connection is damn slow
[22:44] <berlylabs> when I click on it in network settings
[22:44] <hinogi> about 1/100 of the original speed

[22:45] <berlylabs> it says i can check the box to enable it but I have to put in an essid or it disables it
[22:45] <berlylabs> what if the network doesn't have an essid
[22:45] <krazykat> andrew_ sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[22:45] <nownott> saloxin: do i need any outbound rules for http?
[22:45] <zerokill> how can i change xinerama to twinview and does twinview works with compiz?
[22:45] <fm3> zer0-81: odd, did you check the vmware release notes about compatability with your distribution, or check with vmware tech support?
[22:45] <Cpudan80> berlylabs: it better have an ssid
[22:45] <stiv2k> kale: don-o: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41431/
[22:45] <don-o> berlylabs: i leave my wireless connection set to the 'dash' in the checkbox instead of a check.
[22:45] <don-o> berlylabs: then networkmanager will manage it.
[22:45] <zer0-81> fm3: yeah nothing outstanding...
[22:45] <garu> when I boot the system, I cant see the ¨loading screen¨!it gives me a black screen.I do ALT+F1, and it says something about ¨no kinit image found, doing normal boot¨!can someone help?
[22:45] <jakub_> hey :)
[22:45] <saloxin> nownott: you need related and established if policy is drop
[22:45] <jakub_> administrators of packages
[22:45] <berlylabs> oh ok mine has the dash
[22:45] <jakub_> you have wrong depencies :)
[22:45] <berlylabs> so it should be ok
[22:45] <andrew_> krazykat, if i do something wrong i can just do the reverse ofthat command, right?
[22:45] <jakub_> please FIX it !
[22:45] <tomer> l2tp from linux anyone?
[22:45] <jakub_> :)
[22:45] <Brit|box|> just installed firestater   but  can i make me own  firewall ?
[22:46] <kousotu> where does one fine emerald themes/
[22:46] <andrew_> and itll put the backup back as the correct file
[22:46] <krazykat> you would just go
[22:46] <levander> Have there been a lot of problems upgrading from Feisty to Gutsy?
[22:46] <jakub_> Please is there any package administrator ?
[22:46] <hinogi> any possibility how to change wlan networkspeed
[22:46] <krazykat> sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf_backup
[22:46] <dn4> how do I install Couldn't find matching GLX visual
[22:46] <dn4> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[22:46] <jakub_> There are wrong depencies :)
[22:46] <don-o> berlylabs: well thats what i do anyways. in my toolbar is the networkmanager applet and i use that to connect to access points
[22:46] <hinogi> definately levander
[22:46] <jakub_> huhu tralala
[22:46] <krazykat> then save it over /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[22:46] <pike_> Brit|box|: firestarter is just a gui to configure iptables which is your firewall.  do a 'iptables -L' in term to see the current rules
[22:46] <andrew_> yes, thanks

[22:47] <kale> stiv2k: does that work?
[22:47] <Brit|box|> any virtual drives for mounting bin and cue files?
[22:47] <hinogi> levander, i don't think so, most of the time it is stuff like hardware not being supported anymore all of a sudden

[22:48] <andrew_> should i add a new line there?
[22:48] <don-o> kousotu: heh. im a patient man.
[22:48] <andrew_> or edit the xisting
[22:48] <hinogi> well it definatly doesn't

[22:49] <kale> stiv2k: it might be mounted,then something mounted on top of it, i really do not know
[22:49] <andrew_> krazykat the only reason im not sure about this is because i SHOULD have two different monitors showing up, but i only have one (in the dual monitor configuration util in prefs)
[22:49] <krazykat> and that should work.

[22:49] <kkathman> there's no compiz-fusion page for gutsy?
[22:49] <kale> stiv2k: does fstab look ok?
[22:49] <don-o> maybe you have to let the opposing player capture all your pieces to uninstall
[22:49] <stiv2k> kale: how can i fix it
[22:49] <GRocket> Mr. ompaul--Do you think you could help answer question about SU or SUDO?
[22:49] <kousotu> !compiz
[22:49] <ubotu> Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - help in #compiz-fusion
[22:50] <zer0-81> fm3: it looks like it's anytime it goes to display anything other than text... so like when it goes to display vga or whatever...
[22:50] <pike_> dasiala: then sudo mount -a then youll also want to then sudo chown $USER:$USER /home/whatever
[22:50] <radge> hello anyone?
[22:50] <ompaul> !sudo | GRocket , my take on it is - there is only sudo as documented on that page
[22:50] <fm3> zer0-81: haven
[22:50] <ubotu> GRocket , my take on it is - there is only sudo as documented on that page: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[22:50] <satorious> is emerald theme manager no longer in the repos?
[22:50] <don-o> hinogi: 'iwconfig eth1' will tell you its current speed. if you're trying to correct it, thats like wrestling a bear. the wifi card will do what it wants to do, unfortunately.
[22:50] <fm3> zer0-81: haven't seen that before,try google, or maybe vmware tech support
[22:51] <radge> anyone know how i can change it back to ubuntu? from gobuntu
[22:51] <stiv2k> kale: don-o: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41433/
[22:51] <kidicarus> Avant Window Manager... does it work in Gutsy.. or has no one tried it yet??
[22:51] <andrew_> krazy: i have added that line and saved it and closed out of gedit
[22:51] <andrew_> what now?
[22:51] <kkathman> kousotu,  thats not a how to actually
[22:51] <levander> hinogi: In the Gutsy Release Notes it mentions a few problems with ATI cards.  I've got an nVidia card.  Are ATI cards most of the problems?
[22:51] <saloxin> ok the baseball-batlist for gutsy is more or less everything new? compiz, xorg autodetection, bcm drivers, ntfs r/w.
[22:51] <don-o> stiv2k: i hate to give a windows solution but have you tried rebooting?
[22:51] <kale> stiv2k: looks ok
[22:52] <kale> stiv2k: lsof
[22:52] <Cpudan80> levander: Nvidia works fine
[22:52] <krazykat> andrew_ go to the graphical menu and it should appear
[22:52] <radge> i installed gobuntu. how do i switch it back to normal ubuntu?
[22:52] <Cpudan80> levander: NVidia has always worked fine
[22:52] <PhilAirtime> don-o: "Hello IT? Did you try turning it off and on again?"
[22:52] <dasiala> pike_: gksu /etc/fstab /home ?
[22:52] <hinogi> don-o, i'm speaking of wlan actually
[22:52] <Cpudan80> The problem is that ATI has "head in sand" syndrome (similar to adobe)
[22:52] <andrew_> its not an option in screen resolution changer
[22:52] <kousotu> kkathman: worked for me
[22:52] <PhilAirtime> radge: why on earth did you install gobuntu?
[22:52] <maek> so compiz needs more then 1gb of ram to run?
[22:53] <yasper> charlie_ any news?
[22:53] <kousotu> then typ in compiz in synapic
[22:53] <pike_> dasiala: nope 'gksu gedit /etc/fstab' sorry you need to add a line so that your home sda3 or whatever is mounted to /home dir at boot
[22:53] <kkathman> kousotu,  hmm ok
[22:53] <hinogi> and it currently runs on IEEE 802.11g so it ought to use 54mbit
[22:53] <charlie_> yasper: still looking actually
[22:53] <rouben> !gobuntu
[22:53] <ubotu> gobuntu is a freedom-focused flavour of Ubuntu. See http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/130 for more.
[22:53] <hinogi> but obviously it doesn't
[22:53] <localhost> quick question, is there anyway to take the 7.10 x64 iso and install ubuntu from that .rar archive without burning it to a disc?
[22:53] <localhost> my cd-rw is shot. :/
[22:53] <kousotu> and install the thing that replaces compiz
[22:53] <jrattner1> Question Whats thedifference between the ubuntu CD and DVD?
[22:53] <dasiala> pike_:  I already took care of that when I made the partition
[22:53] <levander> Cpudan80: But, I'm asking in general about most of the upgrade to Gutsy problems.  Are most of them related to ATI cards?
[22:53] <hinogi> because if i test the speed its somewhat below 40kb/s
[22:53] <Brit|box|> whats daemon tools equivilant on  nix?
[22:53] <rouben> hmmm... i thought gcommonsense was freedom-oriented, i guess there's another flavour, gobuntu...
[22:53] <don-o> stiv2k: also, check dmesg for recent kernel errors regarding hda1
[22:53] <localhost> lol.
[22:53] <radge> god knows why
[22:53] <Cpudan80> levander: Most problems with graphics stem from ATI - yes
[22:53] <kkathman> kousotu,  did you just go to the compiz-fusion link then?
[22:53] <radge> to see what it was like
[22:53] <adx> gutsy broke my lid working to suspend. it was working perfectly fine in the betas
[22:54] <radge> its just a crippled ubuntu
[22:54] <PhilAirtime> jrattner1: the DVD contains more packages, so less downloading needed. However, that's negated by the fact that you have to download a huge DVD ISO.
[22:54] <radge> lol
[22:54] <kousotu> I did as it says
[22:54] <GRocket> My understanding is that when installing Ubuntu, the username and password I entered would give me administrator rights from another user desktop. But it does not accept my password. Do I need to login as root, and how do I do that?
[22:54] <joakim-> Brit|box|, "mount"
[22:54] <kousotu> then I installed 1 package
[22:54] <janerik> nedd badly help with the wireless... It shows no signal strength... Help please
[22:54] <stiv2k> kale: sorry, i got disconnected
[22:54] <adx> the keys still work, but the lid event is not passed to dbus
[22:54] <dasiala> the directory is booted, but when i try to log in as my previous username it gives me some HOME$/.dmrc error and says something about changing permissions to 644
[22:54] <Brit|box|> joa i can mount bin or sio files?
[22:54] <hinogi> and i can't set any options through iwconfig because it always says "Operation not supported"
[22:54] <don-o> hinogi: you know 54mbit is a pie-in-the-sky not-on-the-best-of-days estimate, right?
[22:54] <kousotu> you'll have to hunt for it
[22:54] <stiv2k> kale: what was the last thing you said
[22:54] <Brit|box|> iso
[22:54] <jrattner1> PhilAirtime, thank you
[22:54] <pike_> dasiala: well if its still there after the upgrade youre fine then you just need to chown -R $USER:$USER /home/whatever and then gksu gedit /etc/passwd and make sure your home dir is right there
[22:54] <kale> stiv2k: lsof, it might reveal something
[22:54] <scguy318> GRocket: i imagine you would have to su into the account with sudoer privs, then just run your sudo fun stuff from there
[22:54] <stiv2k> kale: what am i looking for
[22:54] <krazykat> andrew_ are you going to System -> Pref -> Screen Res or System -> Admin -> Screens and Graphics
[22:54] <dasiala> pike_:  ahh.. thank you!
[22:54] <comicinker> hey guys, I have a problem with this script: http://ubuntuusers.de/paste/16538/
[22:54] <comicinker> the terminal tells me: ./jahshaka-dapper-x86.sh: 3: Syntax error: "(" unexpected
[22:55] <dasiala> hopefully that works
[22:55] <kousotu> where does one find emerald themes?
[22:55] <joakim-> Brit|box|, iso yes, you can convert bin. search the google for mount iso in linux (or mount bin)
[22:55] <don-o> GRocket: when you run sudo, it asks for the password of the currently logged in user.
[22:55] <comicinker> is it again a problem shell-bash?
[22:55] <Jordan_U> Is there a way to diagnose / hopefully fix "could not calculate upgrade" in update-manager ?
[22:55] <^swb^> weeee
[22:55] <jchonig> Good day (evening, night, morning).  Can someone point me to instructions on upgrading from fiesty to gutsy using my local apt-mirror
[22:55] <don-o> GRocket: if you installed ubuntu and created user A, then login as user B and run sudo, it will ask for user B's password
[22:55] <|Kamen|> I've recently installed tovid, it installs to both /usr/bin and /usr/bin/X11, then complains that it wont run unless theres only 1 of it. When removing one set of files, both are removed. What gives?
[22:56] <Brit|box|> joakim-:  thxs google is my friend
[22:56] <scguy318> jchonig: Update Manager should have a little button for upgrade
[22:56] <jakub_> Please, is in ubuntu gutsy COMMERCIAL repository
[22:56] <jakub_> please
[22:56] <PhilAirtime> jchonig: can you not do it through the Update Manager?

[22:56] <ubotu> nabuva: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[22:56] <jchonig> I tried adept on kubuntu, it doesn't let me check the notify of new releases box.  I assume because I'm using a local reposityr
[22:56] <satorious> how can i get emerald-themes back?

[22:57] <ttuttle> PhilAirtime: Oh yeah, we've got I2 here.
[22:57] <ttuttle> ianm_: Nope, I can't ;-)
[22:57] <don-o> scguy318: interesting

[22:58] <ian_> !ntfs
[22:58] <ubotu> ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[22:58] <janerik> anyone have an Idea of what to do when the strength of the wireless signal is not showing???
[22:58] <ian_> !fuse
[22:58] <ubotu> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a !kernel driver that allows non-root users to create their own filesystems. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace for more on FUSE.  Some examples of filesystems that use FUSE are !ntfs-3g, sshfs and isofs. A full list of Filesystems that use FUSE is here:  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems
[22:58] <thingy> minus: https://bugs.launchpad.net/gnome-session/+bug/35393  an alternative is to use ctrl-alt-del and select logout
[22:59] <PhilAirtime> jchonig: if you go to a terminal, type sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and change all instances of feisty to gutsy (press Ctrl-X to exit) then sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, that should do it.
[22:59] <kousotu> Jordan_U: any place I can manually fetch them?
[22:59] <Gusty7> is there any way to get free long-distance app for linux???
[22:59] <tomd123> ianm_: then i will be moving along, not before i install some drm though

[23:03] <zerokill> krazykat: i just found the solution if you are interested. in the compiz control panel. under general options in the display settings you have to add and other output screen with a NULL and diselect the automatic detection

[23:03] <attackdecay> i'm running a macbook core2duo, and it seems that things aren't quite setup correctly for my processor, gutsy generic kernel...
[23:04] <picard_pwns_kirk> !ohmy > comicinker
[23:04] <attackdecay> as in i only get 50% max with any one app
[23:04] <thingy> Feeman: they both should be the same res, are you using a dvi or vga monitor connection?
[23:04] <attackdecay> smp stuff
[23:04] <pike_> dasiala: might sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~ then rerun
[23:04] <krazykat> zerokill sorry about not being able to help
[23:04] <aguitel> pike_ ,my question is because i have 2 pc with ubuntu conected in ethernet cable and i don't see nothing
[23:04] <Feeman> vga cable with dvi adapter
[23:04] <saloxin> profxavier: it means grub/ubuntu is confused by your partition/disk layout. failsafe is /root/ on first partition first disk
[23:04] <profxavier> thingy yeah, I have already tried google myself
[23:04] <kkathman> Jordan_U,  do you need to install emerald ??
[23:04] <satorious> what do i need to install to run svn commands?
[23:04] <jrib> satorious: subversion
[23:04] <andrew_> krazykat i tried to change a setting in the monitors configuration and it turned them off and i had to force a restart
[23:04] <attackdecay> satorious: subversion
[23:04] <dasiala> pike_:  will that work if I'm logged in as a different user?
[23:04] <PhilAirtime> satorious: sudo apt-get install subversion
[23:04] <Lunks> I'm having an issue with Pidgin: I can't set it to a width lower than 645px, and don't know where to solve it. =\
[23:04] <thingy> profxavier: ok with priv msgs?
[23:04] <andrew_> but no luck so far with adding this resolution
[23:04] <pike_> aguitel: no internet or dont see other computers folders?
[23:04] <janerik> nedd badly help with the signal strength is not showing on wireless networks:-)
[23:04] <peepsalot> penguin42, i still can't get this to load :-(
[23:04] <profxavier> saloxin can I troubleshoot with a Live CD?
[23:04] <Feeman> i think the gdm is at the right resolution, but the refresh rate on that is wrong...
[23:04] <profxavier> sure thingy
[23:05] <profxavier> :)
[23:05] <comicinker> pike_: this will be a new note in my linux-notes for the future
[23:05] <don-o> janerik: some wireless drivers dont support signal strength
[23:05] <Jordan_U> kkathman, Not unless you want to use emerald for window decoration :)
[23:05] <pike_> dasiala: 'echo $USER' itll put that value there
[23:05] <andrew_> actually i just got it!
[23:05] <aguitel> pike_: don't see other computer
[23:05] <Feeman> plus when i watch stuff fullcsreen on totem, it changes to another refresh rate @ same resolution as well
[23:05] <saloxin> profxavier: yep. consider reinstalling straight away. will probably be faster
[23:05] <andrew_> sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
[23:05] <[chr0n0s]> is changing gamma, same as changing brightness ??
[23:05] <pike_> aguitel: windows computer?
[23:05] <janerik> don-o: It worked fine with feisty
[23:05] <Gusty7> ok.. thanks again don-o
[23:05] <aguitel> pike_: both with ubuntu gutsy
[23:05] <kkathman> Jordan_U,  well I got the cube now, but alt-f2 doesnt seem to work now - any ideas?
[23:05] <kilopopo> how do i add open-terminal if i right click on a desktop or on a folder?????????????????????
[23:05] <cheetahfoot> ah. does anyone have a link to a method for fixing a broken gutsy upgrade?
[23:05] <NullNone> Gnome-system monitor documentation says that there have to be a menu item View->Threads
[23:05] <NullNone> But there is no that menu item in real program on Ubuntu 7.10.
[23:05] <NullNone> I have all updates installed, and can't understand is the documentation wrong or is there a bug in Gnome-system-monitor
[23:06] <jrib> NullNone: try to keep what you say on a single line, or else the channel becomes too busy
[23:06] <kilopopo> ?
[23:06] <navaburo> kkathman, do you have alt-f2 bound do something in compiz-manager?
[23:06] <saloxin> cheetahfoot: how broken?
[23:06] <Jordan_U> cheetahfoot, How did you upgrade, and in what way is it broken?
[23:06] <pike_> aguitel: sorry im not sure. i normally use sshfs or something to mount my remote computers maybe someone else here can help
[23:06] <kkathman> navaburo,  well I dunno, I just installed it :)
[23:06] <comicinker> saloxin: what did you mean exactly?
[23:06] <jrib> kilopopo: install nautilus-open-terminal
[23:06] <satorious> ughh, why does emerald not seem to work at all in gutsy?
[23:06] <cheetahfoot> only moderately. it freezes up here and there, and my kde desktop does so more often.
[23:06] <aguitel> pike_: ok
[23:06] <cheetahfoot> but it's enough to be not good.
[23:06] <pike_> aguitel: not a firewall issue though do 'sudo iptables -L' to check itll just say all ACCEPT
[23:06] <saloxin> comicinker: the bash syntax seems sane. so the problem might be in the othre end of the symlink sh
[23:06] <navaburo> kkathman, look around in the keybindings for compiz-manager (or ask in #ubuntu-effects)
[23:07] <cheetahfoot> plus, my icons don't seem to be the same anymore ...
[23:07] <DEAthKA_> i  just lost the systray....
[23:07] <kkathman> navaburo,  I seem to not have any title bars, thats usually corrected by having emerald
[23:07] <DEAthKA_> what's the applet name ?
[23:07] <cheetahfoot> i'm in a gnome session now. but swiftfox seems to be a frequent culprit.
[23:07] <mobodo> how can I obtain the UUID of a device?
[23:07] <jrib> DEAthKA_: notification area
[23:07] <comicinker> saloxin: ok, it showed: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 2007-10-12 17:37 /bin/sh -> dash    thats what pike_ assumed, i think
[23:07] <jrib> !uuid > mobodo (read the private message from ubotu)
[23:08] <DEAthKA_> thx
[23:08] <kilopopo> jrib, do i need to relogin?
[23:08] <Jordan_U> cheetahfoot, http://www.getswiftfox.org/
[23:08] <flick> how can i install google earth?
[23:08] <cheetahfoot> Jordan_U: is there a known issue with swiftfox?
[23:08] <Jordan_U> flick, Double click the .deb file :)
[23:08] <blizzkid> lo all. Anyone experienced with postfix troubleshooting?
[23:08] <Triplee23> Hi, I have install 7.10 server and added ubuntu-desktop. Firefox won't start, anyone else with this problmem?
[23:08] <wirchief1> cheetahfoot did you get a brake in your upgrade while downloading?
[23:08] <LiMaO> flick: download it from earth.google.com
[23:08] <don-o> flick: there is no google earth client for linux, and the wine support is marginal
[23:08] <jrib> kilopopo: maybe or restart nautilus
[23:08] <comicinker> flick: go to google.com, they offer the deb file
[23:08] <neon> have ne1 gotten ipblock working with gutsy?
[23:08] <Jordan_U> cheetahfoot, Look at the page I linked to
[23:08] <saloxin> comicinker: same as mine
[23:08] <kkathman> Jordan_U,  AHA I installed emerald and got alt-f2 back and title bars :)
[23:08] <cheetahfoot> wirchief1: ... nope.
[23:08] <jrib> don-o: there is
[23:08] <don-o> comicinker: o rly? i didnt see it last time i looked
[23:08] <cheetahfoot> Jordan_U: will do.
[23:08] <thingy> flick: here's some instructions as well: http://lunapark6.com/ubuntu-710-gutsy-desktop-edition-review.html
[23:09] <chente_pixtol> ls
[23:09] <Lunks> I'm having an issue with Pidgin: I can't set it to a width lower than 645px, and don't know where to solve it. =\
[23:09] <LifeSF> i was told to install a tool like, gproftpd to use ftp with my apache.... thing is... will that take over the main apache? and only go for ftp access when it get's to the server?
[23:09] <jrib> !medibuntu > flick (read the private message from ubotu)
[23:09] <flick> Jordan_U, comicinker there seems to be a .bin file which starts downloading
[23:09] <mobodo> jrib: thanks!
[23:09] <LifeSF> or will i absolutely need to start the address with ftp:// ?
[23:09] <jrib> flick: the medibuntu repo has a google earth package
[23:09] <LiMaO> don-o: are you nuts? of COURSE there is google earth for linux
[23:09] <kkathman> no themes??
[23:09] <don-o> flick: oh sorry i am thinking of Google SketchUp
[23:09] <Pici> LifeSF: Have you wasked in #apache?
[23:09] <picard_pwns_kirk> I need help getting a wired ethernet card working under Linux, it has a Realtek chipset, and is manufactured by TrendNet
[23:09] <LifeSF> yeah... i was told, google
[23:09] <Jordan_U> flick, I could have sworn they had a .deb for Ubuntu
[23:09] <flick> !medibuntu
[23:10] <ubotu> medibuntu is a repository of packages that cannot be included into the Ubuntu distribution for legal reasons - See http://www.medibuntu.org
[23:10] <eikka> I cannot even begin to comprehend why it is so difficult to set up your keyboard layout
[23:10] <comicinker> don-o: you have to look for it. they read your browser settings, too, like many other sites
[23:10] <kkathman> hmm no themes :(
[23:10] <eikka> I try to change my layout but the applet won't do anything
[23:10] <Triplee23> Hi, I have install 7.10 server and added ubuntu-desktop. Firefox won't start, anyone else with this problem?
[23:10] <neon> picard_pwns_kirk: realtek should be automatically recognized by ubuntu what issues are u having
[23:10] <saloxin> picard_pwns_kirk: what does lspci call it?
[23:10] <kilopopo> jrib, thanks its working now
[23:11] <picard_pwns_kirk> neon: it "connects" to my network, but I can't access the internet
[23:11] <satorious> is support for emerald just dropped in gutsy?
[23:11] <jrib> Triplee23: pastebin the terminal output and describe what does happen when you try to start it from the terminal
[23:11] <LifeSF> well not the last question i asked in apache, but the one before that
[23:11] <jrib> satorious: works for me
[23:11] <satorious> jrib: well.. i cannot get to the emerald-themes by any means that i can find
[23:11] <zeke> No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.
[23:11] <saloxin> picard_pwns_kirk: then it's not a network card issue. it's a network issue ;-)
[23:12] <neon> picard_pwns_kirk: do you have any actively firewalls running
[23:12] <zeke> help please?
[23:12] <jrib> satorious: emerald-theme-manager in a terminal?
[23:12] <picard_pwns_kirk> saloxin, everything else connects fine
[23:12] <eikka> Right. Now, how in the name of all that is holy do I set up my logitech mouse? I've tried most of the tutorials in ubuntu forums, but every time Xorg fails to load and instead, all my setup is messed up to pieces
[23:12] <dirtbag666> hi there
[23:12] <neon> picard_pwns_kirk: what does the command     sudo ethtool eth0   says
[23:12] <blizzkid> no1 with postfix experience?
[23:12] <satorious> jrib: i can get to the theme manager, but there are no themes. clicking the buttons to retrieve them gives me.. nothing.
[23:12] <picard_pwns_kirk> neon: lemme try it
[23:12] <ralph_> hi, gusty - compiz don't give me window borders ,  what can i do?
[23:13] <jrib> satorious: yeah that didn't work for me...  I installed them manually
[23:13] <eikka> I don't understand how can it mess up my screen setup when I change my mouse options!
[23:13] <saloxin> blizzkid: state your problem
[23:13] <zeke> my sound card is not detected. what should i do?
[23:13] <neon> have ne1 gotten ipblock working with gutsy?
[23:13] <Triplee23> jjrib: nothing happens when I start from terminal. Clicking the icons starts a process on the taskbar but ends
[23:13] <satorious> jrib: i found a svn command on the forums, but i ran it with no luck.
[23:13] <Triplee23>  after only few seconds.
[23:13] <dirtbag666> i want to update my K(!!)ubuntu Feisty to Gutsy, but Adept always keeps fucking around with verifying the upgrade tools and sometimes even with just downloading them. Can I just use the package update-manager even with Kubuntu?
[23:13] <ePax> How do i degrade from Gutsy to Feisty?
[23:13] <tomd123> I have a problem at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=583869 can anyone help me?

[23:13] <Dr_willis_> ePax,  you dont basicially.
[23:13] <saloxin> blizzkid: logs say anything?
[23:13] <jrib> satorious: what are you trying to do?
[23:13] <TheRepacker> satorious; you have to search for themes then install them for emerald
[23:14] <ePax> So its not possible?
[23:14] <blizzkid> saloxin, what logs should I check for this?
[23:14] <flick> what is /etc/apt/sources.list.d?
[23:14] <eikka> don-o: no. Just a normal MX 518 or something like that. side buttons and a scroll wheel
[23:14] <mc44> ePax: not in any sane way
[23:14] <saloxin> blizzkid: try /var/log/mail.log

[23:14] <Ax-Ax> Why ALSA when OSS works better?
[23:14] <eikka> can't remember the exact model I have, but it's no gizmo magic mouse.
[23:14] <ePax> Ok. Thnx for help.
[23:14] <scguy318> Ax-Ax: because more than one device can use the sound card
[23:14] <mc44> ePax: why do you want to go back?
[23:14] <scguy318> Ax-Ax: I mean, program
[23:14] <zeke> i just installed gutsy and my sound card is not detected.
[23:14] <Ax-Ax> ?
[23:14] <Dr_willis_> zeke,  and whats the sound card?
[23:15]  * SuPeRhOmEm is away: out.. [+lp] (XChat/2.8.0)
[23:15] <scguy318> Ax-Ax: more than one sound program can use the sound card, whereas a program using OSS will lock the card from other programs
[23:15] <ralph_> hi, gusty - compiz don't give me window borders ,  what can i do?
[23:15] <don-o> eikka: well for mysetup, i can see the mouse in lsusb, and in xorg.conf i have Driver "mouse". works fine.
[23:15] <BlaenkDenum> !ntfs-3g

[23:15] <jrib> !away > SuPeRhOmEm (read the private message from ubotu)
[23:15] <Ax-Ax> how do i kill alsa?

[23:15] <scguy318> Ax-Ax: why do you need to remove ALSA? there really is no OSS on Linux
[23:15] <Bax> in usr/bin/, what does the ld program do?
[23:15] <scguy318> Ax-Ax: just compat layers that point to ALSA
[23:15] <saloxin> blizzkid: logs are troubleshooting food
[23:15] <Ax-Ax> lol
[23:15] <don-o> Bax: man ld
[23:15] <mikl> bleh, so much for BulletproofX - it chooses a resolution my screen cannot display :(
[23:15] <jrib> Triplee23: please just pastebin it, you aren's being descriptive enough
[23:15] <Dr_willis_> Bax,  try 'man ld'
[23:16] <comicinker> Ax-Ax: pkill esd
[23:16] <eikka> don-o: yeah, the mouse "works" in the sense that autoscroll doesn't function and the side buttons are dead
[23:16] <ePax> mc44: I have bunch of problems with gutsy wich i didnt have with feisty. Like Firefox and xmms are using 100% of my CPU, Firestarter dissapears from time to time. Compiz setting manager doesnt exist... and so on...
[23:16] <blizzkid> saloxin, yes, strange thing though is it says it tries to connect without password
[23:16] <lucasvo> anyone installed syncevolution on feisty?
=== BaD-Desktop is now known as BaD-CrC

[23:16] <don-o> Ax-Ax: OSS is so 1998
[23:16] <scguy318> Ax-Ax: yes, OSS on Linux is just a compatiblity layer -> ALSA
[23:16] <mc44> ePax: compiz settings manager exists,,, it's called compizconfig-settings-manager

[23:17] <ralph_> no terminal window when compiz is activated too, and that is troubling me
[23:17] <ePax> mc44: Well it exist but it wont start.
[23:17] <BaD-CrC> alsa-oss is a compatibility package for old programs
[23:17] <don-o> eikka: oh i dont know about that stuff :(
[23:17] <satorious> jrib: i just downloaded the .tar.gz file from the ubuntu site. where would i install this to manually?
[23:17] <Dr_willis_> eikka,  i do recall some gentoo docs on tweaking it. But i never really bothered.
[23:17] <mc44> ePax: oh really? what error does it give?
[23:17] <tarfax> sorry, should say, how do i turn *off* the windows blinds effect in gibbon?
[23:17] <ePax> mc44: None.

[23:23] <Boumboum5> flick: wikipedia is a surprisingly good source... so    also look into http://linux-for-beginners.blogspot.com/2006/07/ubuntu-forum-users-blogs.html
[23:23] <ePax> mc44: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1117/
[23:23] <caboose_1980> i have ubuntu 7.10
[23:23] <undauntedspirit> Is there a kernel option to disable all but one CPU?
[23:23] <crshman> is it possible to install ubuntu onto a raid 1 setup between two disks using the live cd??

[23:23] <Optimus55> hey i just installed wine from add/remove but how do i open it? there's no entry in the menus...
[23:23] <Chemical> hi all
[23:23] <soulkeeper> pike_: ok, i see it at /etc/init.d/tftp-hpa, it's a text file. what i do with it?
[23:23] <saloxin> soulkeeper: you got a tftp entry in /etc/inetd.conf?
[23:23] <Brit|box|> cab ahh sorry missunderstood you
[23:23] <caboose_1980> what do i have to type in terminal?
[23:23] <Chemical> anybody knows where can I found the Sonance Media Player ? I can't find it on google .. :/
[23:23] <kilopopo> does ubuntu have gfxbootmenu?
[23:23] <caboose_1980> yo get compiz fusion
[23:24] <uug1> Do you now have to use the junky ubuntu nvidia drivers to make multi monitor to work?  Or can i use the ones from nvidia
[23:24] <TheRepacker> undauntedspirit: yes
[23:24] <satorious> neon: trying to fetch themes from emerald theme manager tells me in the terminal that the certificate is not trusted
[23:24] <don-o> Optimus55: from the command line its $ wine setup.exe (or whatever)
[23:24] <Dr_willis_> caboose_1980,  http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
[23:24] <pike_> Optimus55: you dont really open it. search for wine again in package manager and download xwine you can run that otherwise you just wine whatever.exe
[23:24] <jrib> Triplee23: everything else works without issue?
[23:24] <undauntedspirit> TheRepacker: What is it?
[23:24] <Brit|box|> caboose_1980:  my graphics card wont allow 3d rendering so i dont get it
[23:24] <Triplee23> jrib: yes
[23:24] <pike_> Optimus55: be sure to run 'winecfg' to configure it
[23:24] <LifeSF> umm... ubuntu server 7.10 with ubuntu-desktop: synaptic problems
[23:24] <Dr_willis_> uug1,  the 'junky' ones work fine for me.
[23:24] <neon> you have to accept the certificate permanently  when u run this  svn ls https://svn.generation.no/emerald-themes    make sure you type "P" to answer the question
[23:24] <caboose_1980> oh...
[23:24] <Optimus55> pike_: so download xwine then run winecfg?
[23:25] <caboose_1980> is there a simpler way? like typing something in terminal?
[23:25] <jrib> Triplee23: pastebin 'strace firefox'
[23:25] <uug1> dr_willis_:  they wont work for cedega or any games that require true 3d processing
[23:25] <Elite> Tip for you Ubuntu users: Screw KDE & GNome , Go into synaptics or type sudo apt-get install xfce :)
[23:25] <pike_> Optimus55: yeah. whichever order
[23:25] <satorious> neon: i did.
[23:25] <flick> Boumboum5, Where in Wikipedia? Thanks for the other link...
[23:25] <LifeSF> I cannot reload nor install
[23:25] <Dr_willis_> uug1,  i dont care about games.. so  good luck.
[23:25] <pike_> Optimus55: you dont need xwine but if you want a gui you do
[23:25] <undauntedspirit> Is there a kernel option to disable all but one CPU at boot?
[23:25] <mc44> ePax: did you use trevinos repos in feisty?
[23:25] <Moduliz0r> hmm, in some wine programs how come my fonts aren't that nice, they are usually slightly small or too big, sometimes fairly square, either way it's not the same as when in Windows... Can I copy the fonts from a Windows installation to fix this?
[23:25] <Optimus55> pike_: okay thanks. i'll get it. makes things easier
[23:25] <TheRepacker> undauntedspirit sorry I cann't remember, but there is on, you could also load the i386 kernel, generic is SMP
[23:25] <Nameeater> I'm using ubuntu gutsy with compiz fusion enabled, and when I use the expo plugin it zooms out nicely but then all the desktops disappear (maybe behind the black background) is there anyway to stop that?
[23:25] <Dr_willis_> uug1,  and they worked for me in cedega last i used it..  there is some wiki for using the latest drivers from nvidia. but i dont know what it is.
[23:25] <Kaitlyn2004> how do I set a different wallpaper for each workspace?
[23:26] <saloxin> Moduliz0r: install msttcorefonts
[23:26] <Elite> You can do that in XFCE Kaitlyn2004
[23:26] <pike_> Kaitlyn2004: in kde you can do this easily not sure about gnome
[23:26] <undauntedspirit> TheRepacker: May try that if all else fails - thanks
[23:26] <Moduliz0r> saloxin: is that an apt package?
[23:26] <uug1> dr_willis_: pretty much to get any good fps or antialiasing settings you cant use those generic ubuntu ones
[23:26] <uug1> ill keep looking
[23:26] <Chemical> Damn Sonance becam Banshee :(
[23:26] <saloxin> Moduliz0r: .. yep
[23:26] <neon> satorious: umm i know i did not accepted the certificate permanently the 1111st time and nothing happened then i ran it again and answered p to the question and after that i ran the download non-gpl themes and a bunch og themes appeared under themes
[23:26] <caboose_1980> once i get compiz fusion, do i restart my computer?
[23:26] <TheRepacker> undauntedspirit, why? nvidia problem?

[23:44] <ubotu> envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[23:44] <comicinker> don-o: now I read the documentation. but I don't know what the "modulename" can be
[23:44] <yasper> i regret upgrading to gutsy

[23:45] <uugh> i mean the ubuntu default one
[23:45] <xIke_> Ashfire908, is there any way to wrap that in the suspend commands?  tell suspend to disable compiz before suspend, restore after?
[23:45] <chaosrl> does anyone know how to install winetools in 64-bit?

[23:45] <Pelo> Dumptruck,  and did you configure it ?
[23:45] <TheRepacker> uugh,, no you have to install with Synoptic
[23:45] <seamus7> satorious: look in /usr/share/icons .... and /usr/share/app-install
[23:45] <ryancr> ok I just tried to upgrade via the cd, it got about 60% through the install process then segfaulted...so I don't want to reboot, but when I try to run the upgrade again I get is "Unable to get an exclusive lock" but I can't seem to find the lock file that needs to be removed
[23:45] <uugh> ok .. doing that now then
[23:46] <Dumptruck> Pelo as far as I can tell
[23:46] <don-o> RequinB4: the dist-upgrade step does the whole gutsy upgrade so it should take a long time.
[23:46] <ryancr> Please help.
[23:46] <jrib> Triplee23: and your terminal is also inside a window in a gui?  You started it from the Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal menu?
[23:46] <cdm10> xIke_: I know that there are two scripts, one run at suspend and one run at resume, but I'm not sure where they are...
[23:46] <Ashfire908> garu, that's normal. it means your system did not go into hibernation
[23:46] <comicinker> don-o: now i added a modulename. but cvs tells me: cvs checkout: No CVSROOT specified!  Please use the `-d' option
[23:46] <Triplee23> jrib: yes

[23:46] <Brit|box|> nice to see Bill Gates doent own the internet
[23:46] <don-o> comicinker: yeah use that log command you pasted first but replace login with 'co modulename' (i think)
[23:46] <Pelo> Dumptruck, check in your bios , some have security features to stop virus from writing on certain files,  disable it
[23:46] <Kaitlyn2004> how do I UNINSTALL soething?
[23:46] <xIke_> Ashfire908, cdm10, dga: thanks
[23:46] <don-o> comicinker: i mean 'long' command, not log command
[23:46] <cdm10> xIke_: look in /etc/acpi
[23:46] <Pelo> Kaitlyn2004,  use synaptic
[23:46] <Ashfire908> Colro, install the OO.org theme for that theme?
[23:47] <jrib> Triplee23: close this one and open a new terminal.  Then type 'gedit'.  Does that open the text editor?

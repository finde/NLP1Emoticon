[negative] [01:18] <Abnaxos> Hi again! Still having problems with network manager since the upgrade to Feisty. :( I could break it down to network manager not receiving any notifications from dhcdbd.

[positive] [03:01] <mister_roboto> TheIronChef: eventually you get used to everything just working without being loaded with tons of useless advertising crap (all new windows pc's) and you'll come to love it :)   that is, if you get past the learning curve and can do all the work you need to do
[positive] [03:07] <[acid] Neatchee> downfallat111: nope.  This'd be it :)

[positive] [03:32] <HasratUSA> witless it would be great for yourself if you don't cause although it's extremely slow right now, you will be downloading some files at an extremely slow rate. on the other hand, the more people gets frustrated, impatient and kills the upgrade, the more speed i get :)

[negative] [05:04] <Abom> pppoe_dude: there's some problem with not having a password with wireless connections :(
[positive] [05:04] <RAOF> rellik_: Yes.  Basically, you just have to run "update-manager" twice :)
[negative] [05:05] <vafada> i'm getting "can't access tty; Job control turned off" when booting LiveCD :(  i have ubuntu ultimate edition right now so i had no problems with previous ubuntu
[positive] [05:06] <RAOF> NemesisD: Yes, indeed.  They are both window managers, and you can't have two programs managing your windows at the same time :)
[positive] [05:07] <Frog29> Pelo - ok i'll look it up or ask around :)
[positive] [05:09] <lisapc> stefg, be silent pls :)  you talking nonsense again!  I told you, i had Grub boot from my 2nd HDD before
[positive] [05:10] <taggie> sorry knix, i'm too slow :)
[positive] [05:11] <knix_> taggie, no prob, :)
[positive] [05:12] <RAOF> rellik_: I don't think so.  Also, trying to upgrade your stuff over SSH is a recipie for misery :)

[positive] [05:18] <Awperator> Can anyone please answer my wine question? No one seems to be in the wine channel. Pm me if you can. Thanks :)
[negative] [05:23] <RAOF> fulat2k: You can't, sucks to be not runnign Gnome :(
[positive] [05:24] <fulat2k> RAOF: besides reading binarydriverhowto/nvidia that is :)
[positive] [05:31] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: ok... so your problem seems to be on how to create a torrent, and not really with ktorrent (you could use other clients for that) :)
[positive] [05:34] <lisapc> Pelo, I figured it out!  was easy.  I simply removed grub from 1st HDD, and then "sudo grub-install /dev/sdb" which installs it on my 2nd HDD.  I now dont even need the 1st HDD to load Ubuntu. :)
[positive] [05:37] <labanux> Vaske_Car : select mirror closest to your home.. :)
[positive] [05:37] <xechostor> roller : thanks :)
[positive] [05:38] <lisapc> Pelo, and I am in awe of your ignorance :)

[positive] [05:48] <billy> RAOF: yeah, I know.  ** if only **.  :)
[positive] [05:53] <ajax4> zero88: You can optimize it to your exact hardware, but its not for beginners :)

[positive] [06:05] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: sounds wacko :)...are you using x?
[positive] [06:06] <RAOF> blrich: Yeah, try the Feisty LiveCD, and possibly just install a Dapper chroot into it :)
[positive] [06:07] <blrich> RAOF, SuperLag Flannel thanks for your help :)
[positive] [06:08] <mojojojo_> gecko: I'm from Poland, so it's rather distant from there :)
[positive] [06:10] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: I mean your little "ticks" in the boxes in there :)

[positive] [06:34] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: sounds like I should just try :)
[positive] [06:39] <RAOF> Tarkus: Yes.  Just right click on the .iso, and select "Burn to disk" :)
[positive] [06:44] <zcat[1] > some people say 4x but that's a bit too slow for me :)

[negative] [11:07] <arthur_kalm> it never complained when I used nvidia-glx-new (same version).... I'm not sure if I should remove nvidia-kernel-common since it asks to remove linux-generic, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic, linux-restricted-modules-generic, but I think that nvidia-kernel-common is confusing the latest nVidia driver. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I need my second monitor and 1280x1024 resolution :(

[positive] [11:17] <eric> it goes through md: raid messages, then hangs trying to find the root file system (can't find root file system).  there is no raid on this laptop, so not sure why it is loading raid "stuff" :)

[positive] [11:29] <Supaplex> starman: yes, lots of things, but not what you describe. :) even a tarball would be prone to resizing on changes. (unless the file content sizes were the same before and after)
[positive] [11:30] <jrib> arthur_kalm: it's ok, I knew where to look :)
[positive] [11:44] <dcomsa> AATDark: sudo :)
[negative] [11:44] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, yeah i dont hear that :( i tried changing all of them in there to OSS
[negative] [11:49] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, im thinking i should just take this damn sound card out and go from the onboard :(
[positive] [11:53] <slackern> kzm: hehe well this x1950 card is no joyride, trust me about that, i would toss it out for a nvidia card any day :)

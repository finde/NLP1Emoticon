[01:18] <Abnaxos> Hi again! Still having problems with network manager since the upgrade to Feisty. :( I could break it down to network manager not receiving any notifications from dhcdbd. It might be related to the following message in the syslog: dhcdbd: message_handler: message handler not found under /com/redhat/dhcp/eth0 for sub-path eth0.dbus.get.reason
[01:21] <Msakaji> Pie-rate: Like a lot of things in the end. :)
[01:26] <sylvisj> if only 7.04 detected the 8800gts as an 8800gts and didn't try to rape me using nv :(
[01:26] <breakthru> i have a blank screen with nvidia drivers :( that happens on ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04
[01:26] <bimberi> nu-: obotu is tired :)
[01:27] <Gold2> RT61 is working perfectly out of the box :)
[01:31] <variant> feistyman: i fyou keep it up to date then yes, you are already using feisty final :)
[01:35] <Angeluz> Kagaru: Bills multimedia-house runs Linux. :)
[01:35] <zbrown> gils: no, its already done :)
[01:37] <bimberi> :)
[01:37] <variant> sldkfj: well, simple enough to replicate :)
[01:38] <bimberi> Tell: ask away and we'll see :)
[01:45] <mrpoundsign> this morning, it was 1 day 18 hours. Now it's 12 hours. An hour ago it was 18 hours.  :)
[01:47] <ajehuk> mike1 - ah I could disagree with you there, but I'll save that for some other time :)
[01:47] <wondering> How would I make a command line only LiveCD that's based on ubuntu-7.04-alternate.iso ? Could someone help me please? I've searched all over Google and I can't seem to find anything :(
[01:47] <bimberi> Mr_Giraffe: :)
[01:48] <bimberi> SubMOA: cool :)
[01:49] <aoirthoir> :(
[01:49] <xq> wondering: Heh, that would be quite a lot of work :)
[01:50] <xq> That's all, you already have your name :) You can change it via /nick <nickname>
[01:52] <aoirthoir> etplayer_fiesty9: i will wait until next week then have ubuntu support step me through it. Thats what I pay them for:)
[01:53] <aoirthoir> etplayer_fiesty9: ah ok I gotcha. Yeah it worked with dapper and edgy. So ima just wait:)
[02:00] <ajehuk> Mr_Giraffe - I wouldnt rule it out - but I wouldnt look at it first - dont change something else - it only makes trouble shooting harder :)
[02:03] <ajehuk> foug - lol - sorry :)
[02:05] <Sterk> duelboot, thanks a bunch :)
[02:09] <atoponce> homanj: thx. :)

[02:38] <NET||abuse> matt__, :) saw something about deps being a bit broken for java 6 on feisty
[02:40] <NET||abuse> DigitalNinja, i had a few weirdnesses last 2 days with security, but htat's europe based :)
[02:42] <jrib> Stormx2: yes, I think so.  Try it! :)
[02:43] <NET||abuse> TheIronChef, look up the mp3 codecs.. what'r they called again. :)
[02:43] <NET||abuse> ytsestef, lotsa xorg.conf fiddling :)
[02:44] <Frog29> Hey - any way to isntall feisty fawn without internet? (or can someone help me get my wireless working JUSt so i can update :) )
[02:44] <NET||abuse> ytsestef, go to the www.beryl-project.org wiki and go through the setup details :)
[02:46] <NET||abuse> hmmm, how robust is the ipod mini G1, i'm really rough on portable gear :)
[02:47] <TheoMurpse> Wow, the servers really are taking a hit. Right now my upgrade says 14 hours left to finish the upgrade. :(
[02:49] <Frog29> so a revision of my question :) - can you UPDATE 6.10 using the altrenate cd? or can you just reisntall it?
[02:50] <[acid] Neatchee> Pie-rate: 'grats.  Wish it did for me :(  What wireless card do you use?
[02:52] <ryeth> matt:  just learned what ntfs-3g was yesterday :)
[02:52] <Frog29> ok - i'll go torrent with everyone :)
[02:55] <Frog29> garryfre - i used to be :)

[02:58] <pipeline_> mister_roboto: i'll redownload :)
[03:00] <TheIronChef> this is weird getting used to ... ive used xp since the day it came out and jsut installed feisty today... kinda different :(
[03:01] <mister_roboto> TheIronChef: eventually you get used to everything just working without being loaded with tons of useless advertising crap (all new windows pc's) and you'll come to love it :)   that is, if you get past the learning curve and can do all the work you need to do
[03:07] <[acid] Neatchee> downfallat111: nope.  This'd be it :)
[03:08] <jaz_> rofl ubuntu just ruined my vista :(
[03:08] <TheIronChef> i like vista :(
[03:09] <mister_roboto> TheIronChef: it's ok to like vista :)
[03:09] <disasm> no it's slowing down :(( was at 500, now it's down to 300 k/s
[03:09] <russe11> magnetron: I don't think you're rude. :)

[03:17] <mister_roboto> BHSPitMonkey: i'm just the messenger, dude :)

[03:24] <NickGarvey> jrib: :)
[03:25] <tbuss> NickGarvery: no offense to those out there that are very skilled in linux, but those guys in #apache don't seem to like noobies :)
[03:26] <TheIronChef> how do i join that :(
[03:27] <LabThug_hm> no ' of course :)
[03:27] <HasratUSA> okay hell with the upgrade im sticking to edgy :)

[03:29] <ShiFTKey> IndyGunFreak: thanks, I burned a disk at work, but forgot to bring it home :(
[03:31] <TheDebugger> ShiFTKey: Yes, already ordered mine :)
[03:31] <arejay> NickGarvey, thank's :)
[03:31] <tristil> clop, I wasn't telling you not to do, that's just what I got through Google. :)
[03:32] <HasratUSA> witless it would be great for yourself if you don't cause although it's extremely slow right now, you will be downloading some files at an extremely slow rate. on the other hand, the more people gets frustrated, impatient and kills the upgrade, the more speed i get :)
[03:33] <Ax4> disasm, cool :)
[03:35] <Ax4> im gonna throw my 2 x 100mbit boxes on the torrent to help out :)
[03:37] <rukuartic> aoliax: Probably overloaded, or it hit a big package :)
[03:37] <[acid] Neatchee> fulat2k: I literally just asked that question when I came in here, so glad to pass on the info :)

[03:49] <hagabaka> i'm actually getting segmentation fault when running aptitude, or apt-get :(
[03:49] <rukuartic> bambie: How is it? I'm still updating :(
[03:51] <oblib> Flannel, I thought it would, but wanted to make sure before I lost it forever :)
[03:55] <HasratUSA> i live in Queens, NYC and the only broadband provider in my area is time warner cable and failing to get a connection from comcast i felt unlucky and now i thank god Crapcasr isn't in here :) by the way are you using dsl?

[04:30] <LoneShadow2> come back tomm BILL-GATES :)
[04:33] <bimberi> BILL-GATES: it's support channel full of wonderful but offtopic intolerant helpers :)
[04:33] <liz0r1> ubuntu (feisty fawn) sound plays out of headphone and external speakers at the same time. An idea how to only get it playing out of my headphones :)
[04:34] <bimberi> Pelo: yes, i'll confess later :)

[04:42] <xq> hey Nick -- again :)
[04:46] <JebJoya> :)
[04:48] <xq> Anyone think Ubuntu will have a problem setting itself up on a computer with 4 sata hard drives? Just putting Ubuntu on one (ext3 the entire drive and partition /home seperately)...think it will install GRUB correctly? :) Debian can't! lol
[04:49] <DARKGuy> wobx: I see, thanks :)
[04:50] <r0bby_> getting help in here is fun :)
[04:50] <zntneo> :(
[04:51] <wobx> DARKGuy: np :) hf with ubuntu :>
[04:52] <looknglass> PresuntoRJ: hey :) Brazil is fklying, cheers dude
[04:52] <Artemis3> kondor101, sadly, yes, the main page needs a big TORRENT button :)
[04:53] <Humjaba> stefg: :( The mirrors now are crying
[04:53] <Nerdz> slop: No it's not working :(
[04:54] <Abom> sorry, I reposted on accident :)
[04:55] <Abom> trying to get an answer to my issue, I can't get online :(
[04:55] <Humjaba> my windows machine is crying now too... uninstalling office, encoding a dvd and downloading ubuntu install cd... on a single-core amd 3200+ :(
[04:56] <Frog29> pelo- ok.............. :)
[04:57] <Abom> Tonren: so everything's working now? :) maybe photoshop was interpreting you're computer as if it were windows or something
[05:00] <bimberi> kondor101: heh :)
[05:02] <DeX-aNoM-MwG-> Pelo: Thanks :)
[05:02] <Abom> k thanks :)
[05:04] <Abom> pppoe_dude: there's some problem with not having a password with wireless connections :(
[05:04] <RAOF> rellik_: Yes.  Basically, you just have to run "update-manager" twice :)
[05:05] <vafada> i'm getting "can't access tty; Job control turned off" when booting LiveCD :(  i have ubuntu ultimate edition right now so i had no problems with previous ubuntu
[05:06] <RAOF> NemesisD: Yes, indeed.  They are both window managers, and you can't have two programs managing your windows at the same time :)
[05:07] <Frog29> Pelo - ok i'll look it up or ask around :)
[05:09] <lisapc> stefg, be silent pls :)  you talking nonsense again!  I told you, i had Grub boot from my 2nd HDD before
[05:10] <taggie> sorry knix, i'm too slow :)
[05:11] <knix_> taggie, no prob, :)
[05:12] <RAOF> rellik_: I don't think so.  Also, trying to upgrade your stuff over SSH is a recipie for misery :)
[05:14] <SuperLag> slyfox: you paying attention? :)
[05:15] <Frog29> eric - welcome :)
[05:15] <kondor101> now im seeding,  now im giving back :)))
[05:17] <rellik_> RAOF, yeah, I will try x-forwarding..  not ideal but ok :)
[05:18] <Awperator> Can anyone please answer my wine question? No one seems to be in the wine channel. Pm me if you can. Thanks :)
[05:23] <RAOF> fulat2k: You can't, sucks to be not runnign Gnome :(
[05:24] <fulat2k> RAOF: besides reading binarydriverhowto/nvidia that is :)
[05:31] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: ok... so your problem seems to be on how to create a torrent, and not really with ktorrent (you could use other clients for that) :)
[05:34] <lisapc> Pelo, I figured it out!  was easy.  I simply removed grub from 1st HDD, and then "sudo grub-install /dev/sdb" which installs it on my 2nd HDD.  I now dont even need the 1st HDD to load Ubuntu. :)
[05:37] <labanux> Vaske_Car : select mirror closest to your home.. :)
[05:37] <xechostor> roller : thanks :)
[05:38] <lisapc> Pelo, and I am in awe of your ignorance :)
[05:47] <RAOF> billy: Ok.  It's just that it's *much, much* easier to use apt instead :)
[05:48] <billy> RAOF: yeah, I know.  ** if only **.  :)
[05:53] <ajax4> zero88: You can optimize it to your exact hardware, but its not for beginners :)
[05:54] <zero88> ajax4 RAOF oh ok,then ill stear clear of that for now :)
[05:56] <Kickersny> rellik, year.month :)
[05:59] <blrich> RAOF, oh good :( oh well i thought there might be something caus it has nvidia stuff
[06:05] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: sounds wacko :)...are you using x?
[06:06] <RAOF> blrich: Yeah, try the Feisty LiveCD, and possibly just install a Dapper chroot into it :)
[06:07] <blrich> RAOF, SuperLag Flannel thanks for your help :)
[06:08] <mojojojo_> gecko: I'm from Poland, so it's rather distant from there :)
[06:10] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: I mean your little "ticks" in the boxes in there :)
[06:16] <labanux> crimsun: the module can't be found.. :(
[06:16] <Nergar> anyone want to recommend me some cool aps??? /msg me the apps :)
[06:28] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: VERY NOTaccelerated :)
[06:30] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: seems from the bot that I should just wait and see when the servers are not under such heavy attack :)
[06:31] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: guess I'll wait a few days then :)...see you round mate
[06:32] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: but guess I should be going to work :) - have a nice day/night!
[06:33] <Frog29> Diabolix - ( i am a windows convert :) )
[06:33] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: hehe...it's sorta cool...here its 06:33 AM :) but sleep tight when you get there :)
[06:34] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: sounds like I should just try :)
[06:39] <RAOF> Tarkus: Yes.  Just right click on the .iso, and select "Burn to disk" :)
[06:44] <zcat[1] > some people say 4x but that's a bit too slow for me :)
[06:48] <Meshezabeel> k-edgy: np :)
[06:50] <Rictoo> I see :)
[06:50] <billy> deCon, to a DVD.  :)
[06:50] <billy> deCon, just be really sure to read everything carefully, as in, don't tell it to format /home.  :)
[06:52] <Madpilot> billy, sorry, wrong person. :) /opt is in Root - which the file manager in Ubuntu called File System
[06:54] <billy> Madpilot, :)  I'm sorry dude.   /opt really, truly honestly isn't there.  Can I post a screenshot somewhere?

[09:37] <tristanmike> ajax4: yeah, I've been there, it's not working for me :(
[09:39] <Donovan_> Tomcat: There is no php4 in feisty, sadly :(

[09:50] <what_if> magnetron: my card does not work with the NV driver... just random colors :(
[09:52] <Amaranth> bayziders: Yeah, it's awesome :)

[09:58] <ubotu> oxygen: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:01] <Amaranth> Donovan_: no, that's what apt is for :)
[10:04] <fluid> only bad thing about this install is that i have to force beryl to render through copy...which makes it slower than it should be :(
[10:08] <gustavo> Ademan, because i want :)
[10:10] <gustavo> medinfo: its done, i just need to know where is my image :(
[10:11] <Hairulfr> fluid: Workflow ;) it just takes too long, I can do pretty much the same, only slower and a lot more bothersome :)
[10:14] <paroneayea> sorry, that was rude of me :)
[10:15] <foxiness> can i say hi :) ?
[10:19] <Hairulfr> jussi01: FOund it :) Wow, I got so used to apt-get that this is frightening and a disturbing world, downloading from at HP
[10:19] <Meshezabeel> magnetron, tx for the cd/dvd help :)
[10:19] <gustavo> zilly6_, it will be better if u are using a k8 kernel :)
[10:20] <gustavo> zilly6_, yeah, really, that sucks :(
[10:21] <Hairulfr> ccfiel: It should be yes :)
[10:22] <bomanizer> gharz: k, thans.. i'm off to the forums, these damn irc channels are too frantick for me :)

[10:27] <ccfiel> dystopianray: i currently have an ati 9250 :( is not supported in restricted.
[10:29] <Hairulfr> jussi01: No, I haven't, I need the power that photoshop gives... :(
[10:30] <Hairulfr> LaNCeloT_RW: 32-bit :)
[10:30] <ccfiel> dystopianray: ok thanks! i will buy now. :)
[10:31] <Hairulfr> jussi01: Nice :)
[10:32] <fluid> its a pain. lol...70 megs of libraries for 32bit support. :(
[10:40] <jin> :S feisty is so slow compared dapper :(
[10:52] <ubotu> Kakurady: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:56] <cables> flamebird, i mean button, not version :)
[10:59] <slackern> protocol1, np, hope it helps, my x1950 card i will just smash with a hammer :)

[11:06] <TommyTom> ikonia_: from what i understand though, software raid i would have to wipe the whole array. i can do that. 400gb gone :(
[11:14] <copper> ikonia_: ok, thanks :)
[11:18] <gustavo> iknonia ive did it so many times without any problem :)
[11:18] <gustavo> ikonia ive did it so many times without any problem :)
[11:19] <gustavo> lol, not really... but it happens while i was trying :)
[11:20] <gustavo> but its the truth, never happened before... :)
[11:21] <gargoyle80> what is currently the best direct connect client for ubuntu? :)
[11:23] <gustavo> maybe in another time, im not good enough :)
[11:23] <THJ> when i started out in 1997 it was slackware 3.0 :)
[11:25] <gustavo> oh, u are very helpful :)
[11:25] <gustavo> is there a chan for kernel help? :)
[11:26] <THJ> that's the thing about OSS volunteer help. "thou arth inferior, but I shalt helpeth thou.", okay, time to shut up. :)

[12:05] <QwertyM> TheoMurpse: Oh, okay, good if it has a fix, cause am not in a mood to reinstall again :(
[12:05] <TheoMurpse> QwertyM I've no idea if it has a fix. I'm looking at a black screen right now for the past 10 minutes :(

[02:10] <CompuChip> ikonia_ :( so just make a fresh install and then try the upgrade again
[02:15] <ferronica> there is no way to copy paste my ubuntu 6.10 data to windows :(
[02:15] <ferronica> CompuChip: Mp3 and Movies :)

[09:32] <allquixotic> Scunizi: I read that - VLM can stream video but not audio :(
[09:35] <riaal> I have an empty (old windows D:) ntfs partion on my main hdd, how do I format it to ext3?
[09:39] <NET||abuse> Jordan_U, was just looking into xargs for an option :) would even be able to replicate the directory structure :)
[09:55] <vertana> You did,  I got the message :)
[09:56] <Solver> I've been using hibernate on wife's lappie but she's sick of how slow it is :)

[10:06] <Kaplan_> PriceChild: tx a lot :)
[10:08] <allquixotic> Scunizi: I found a solution to my problem, a very good one. idjc (Internet DJ Control) is an *excellent* streamer that supports ShoutCast :) I am running JACK on top of dmix in non-realtime, high-latency mode (which is OK for this application) to host the stream. http://sheltered.hobby-site.com:8000/listen.pls :D

[10:19] <what_if> Seveas: oh, well hi :) and TY for the edgy version, spot on :)
[10:20] <tunganet> Jordan_U: it would be hard for me to mess up the upgrade right.. i am really scared :)
[10:22] <LjL> Rictoo, do you only ask questions, or do you also look at the answers? :)
[10:22] <Rictoo> PlanetPenguin :)

[10:36] <ubotu> adam: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:40] <kane77> eck, why not? :(
[10:42] <Jordan_U> Xyon, Install with the alternate install CD, no GUI == no problem installing :)

[10:45] <AATDark> Xyon: then the link wont help you :(
[10:47] <ubotu> Blubloblu: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[11:07] <arthur_kalm> it never complained when I used nvidia-glx-new (same version).... I'm not sure if I should remove nvidia-kernel-common since it asks to remove linux-generic, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic, linux-restricted-modules-generic, but I think that nvidia-kernel-common is confusing the latest nVidia driver. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I need my second monitor and 1280x1024 resolution :(

[11:14] <CirroX> burning my first CD on ubuntu :)
[11:15] <eric> hello, i upgraded to feisty, now i can't boot.... it installed raid, but I don't have raid. I am at rescue prompt, how do I turn off raid/madm or whatever? :)
[11:15] <dcomsa> crzyboon: then sorry for my answer :)
[11:17] <eric> it goes through md: raid messages, then hangs trying to find the root file system (can't find root file system).  there is no raid on this laptop, so not sure why it is loading raid "stuff" :)
[11:19] <eric> i just went through the upgrad process from edgy and now it thinks it is a raid computer :)  how do I remove the modules that / reconfig it ?
[11:19] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, k i'll try that too. but its not picking anything up at all :( lemme keep trying
[11:20] <kzm> slackern: what do you see i dont see? i mostly see people confirming the problem.. its huge though and i run on 640x480 right now... :)
[11:25] <Gunrun> I am looking at http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download and don't see them :(
[11:26] <Gunrun> oh ok :)
[11:27] <Gunrun> hmm I thought there was a DVD version of ubuntu :(
[11:27] <PovAddict> Gunrun: there is, didn't find that link so fast :)
[11:28] <slackern> kzm: oh hehe thats just the regular pastebin site, no idea why it's .nl though :)
[11:29] <Supaplex> starman: yes, lots of things, but not what you describe. :) even a tarball would be prone to resizing on changes. (unless the file content sizes were the same before and after)
[11:30] <jrib> arthur_kalm: it's ok, I knew where to look :)
[11:44] <dcomsa> AATDark: sudo :)
[11:44] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, yeah i dont hear that :( i tried changing all of them in there to OSS
[11:49] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, im thinking i should just take this damn sound card out and go from the onboard :(
[11:53] <slackern> kzm: hehe well this x1950 card is no joyride, trust me about that, i would toss it out for a nvidia card any day :)
[11:55] <dcomsa> Shoeb: :)
[11:56] <dcomsa> ulf_am_beat: where are you from? :)
[11:57] <slackern> kzm: share it with Notchnick  he has the same problem :)

00:00	<pppoe_dude>	jcole, ah
00:00	<axjv>	Alright, what do I do with the selector?
00:00	<Beta-guy>	is there a way to update apt-get's package lists?
00:00	<capiira>	on the circle you see a node with a round handle
00:00	<sivik>	Beta-guy, apt-get update
00:00	<notv>	yay gutsy on my laptop!!
00:00	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	Lamego:  ok ill bite whats gutsy? just installed this today  so sorry for noob question
00:00	<axjv>	Just 3 square nodes.
00:00	<MTughan>	locellcount: I can look it up. I still have Fiesty on my VM.
00:00	<Lamego>	Beta-guy, when the mirrors do not have problems, yes
00:00	<capiira>	nah one is round
00:00	<locellcount>	MTughan: Cheers!
00:00	<axjv>	Oh
00:00	<garu>	how long do you guys reckon it would take me to download the livedvd torrent?
00:00	<axjv>	I see
00:00	<axjv>	Wow
00:01	<axjv>	Kay...
00:01	<capiira>	move that
00:01	<Lamego>	Unbutu[G33Z3R, Gutsy is the release name for the latest Ubuntu version which was released today
00:01	<murkyMurk>	sco50000: it's usually a question of trying several routes...best 1st step is goolging for ubuntu + your hardware...usually you aren't the first to crash & burn
00:01	<sco50000>	gutsy is the newest version of ubuntu: 7.10
00:01	<sco50000>	murkyMurk: ok, i'll try that
00:01	<sivik>	sco50000, yes
00:01	<skyrocker67>	I am going to reinstall 7.04 and do the update instead
00:01	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	lem so all i have to do is  look in system and  search for the 2nd hdd  and ill be able to pull media files off? thanks for the help
00:01	<murkyMurk>	sco50000: yes, but new doesn't always mean backwards comaptible
00:01	<younan1>	am i the only one? "Getting Upgrade Prerequisites failed:The system was unable to get the prerequisites"
00:01	<axjv>	capiira: How can I get it to take something like a spreadsheet?
00:01	<MTughan>	locellcount: Do you use Ubuntu or Kubuntu?
00:01	<locellcount>	ubuntu
00:02	<sivik>	skyrocker67, why not just skip the install of 7.04 and install 7.10 if thats what you want
00:02	<MTughan>	So GNOME...
00:02	<Beta-guy>	I think I screwed my linux up...
00:02	<capiira>	no way
00:02	<locellcount>	MTughan: yup
00:02	<strav>	he... I'm wondering one thing... is ubuntu goatse out yet? couldn't find it anywhere....
00:02	<sivik>	skyrocker67, its kinda a extra step not needed
00:02]  * kitche thinks people should wait a while before upgrading unless you know what your really doing incase it breaks which it usually does within the first 2 weeks
00:02	<Deryk>	sivik; pm
00:02	<LuCypher>	inter-net: it doesn't works for me
00:02	<bluefox83>	younan1, no, i had the same problem..the servers are being sucked dry right now so it's kinda slow going
00:02	<sivik>	Deryk, private message
00:02	<capiira>	then you need to use the one from spreadsheet app
00:02	<MTughan>	strav: Gutsy. And yes.
00:02	<Xore|work>	um
00:02	<sco50000>	murkyMurk: i was just answering someone's question: "what is gusty?"
00:02	<pommer>	hey people. how do i install themes onto ubuntu?
00:02	<stray77>	it took me 7 hrs to download the gutsy dvd but i was also downloading the i386 iso and the amd64 iso at the same time
00:02	<Deryk>	oh wait
00:02	<garu>	strav it came out today 18/10/07 go to www.ubuntu.com
00:02	<Xore|work>	for people who have downloaded the desktop cd's for upgrades
00:02	<murkyMurk>	sco50000: lol..soz..on auto-pilot
00:02	<skyrocker67>	i have 7.10 install but cant get my broadcom wifi working which is suppose to be fixed
00:02	<Deryk>	i didnt reg my nick yet
00:02	<Xore|work>	use the alternate cd's instead
00:02	<rkyraccoon55>	is there any way to get .mp3 and .m4a support in gutsy x64?
00:02	<garu>	stray77 7 hours?how fast is your broadband?
00:03	<Lamego>	skyrocker67, doing the upgrade will not be a solution
00:03	<pommer>	and where can i find good caps for the beryl system. i got venom spiderman thats it o.O
00:03	<sivik>	Deryk, go ahead and do that
00:03	<axjv>	capiira: Are you there?
00:03	<PriceChild>	rkyraccoon55, play one of them with totem and it will guide you through installing the required packages
00:03	<capiira>	yeah
00:03	<robotphood>	Xore|work, use the alt cd to upgrade?
00:03]  * nomaS is away: vuelvo
00:03	<kst->	PriceChild so i can remove the desktop effects thing from the main menu? how come this wasnt removed, is more stuff on my system not up to date then? can i somehow clean all this old stuff up?
00:03	<skyrocker67>	ok then what the heck can I do?
00:03	<Lamego>	I mean, installing the older version and performing the upgrade, will not resolve your hw support problem
00:03	<younan1>	bluefox83, you sure its just a bandwidth issue? I've tried it repeatedly on one computer and keep getting this problem, but on another computer connected to the same internet connetion, it worked the first time
00:03	<Slart>	rkyraccoon55: mp3 can't be that hard.. I have, apparently, done it in the past and I'm not that clever =)
00:03	<Xore|work>	robotphood: yes
00:03	<sivik>	skyrocker67, what kind of problem is it?
00:03	<Slart>	!mp3

00:03	<capiira>	axjv there is no way to link to to a spreatsheet app

00:03	<robotphood>	Xore|work, desktop cd doesn't work? because I'm trying to use it right now
00:03	<skyrocker67>	I think a pci on
00:04	<stray77>	but like i said i had multiple torrents downloading
00:04	<bluefox83>	younan1, yeah...cus i had the same problem
00:04	<skyrocker67>	cant detect pci
00:04	<the_darkside_986>	ok i got into an x-less console in the gutsy live cd but i don't what to do to make x start working... the only error (EE) i got was AIGLX screen 0 doesn't support DRI...
00:04	<rkyraccoon55>	pricechild, thanks
00:04	<axjv>	capiira: Erm, how about something like this: http://www.duoh.com/varia/illustrator_charts/
00:04	<capiira>	axjv then you need to use the one build-in the spreatsheet app
00:04	<skyrocker67>	which i beleave is what the wifi is on
00:04	<rkyraccoon55>	slart, yea i think i got it thanks

00:04	<garu>	stray77 OMG...you must have a very good connection...I'm downloading now, only one thing, and I'm getting only 20kb/s!lol
00:04	<capiira>	axjv no way
00:04	<pazsion>	I'm having some issues with ubuntu install on an intel i810 chipset
00:04	<demon_spork>	The Gutsy livecd won't load video correctly for me on my 8800GTS!!
00:05	<Xore|work>	if you don't want to have to connect to ubuntu servers (ie, bloody slow) to run updates, then use the alternate cds (see above link)
00:05	<jacob_>	can somebody explain to me why when i enter sudo apt-get install k3b doesn't install k3b? is there an alternative?
00:05	<Lamego>	Unbutu[G33Z3R, Welcome to Ubuntu ;)
00:05	<the_darkside_986>	does anyone know what to do for getting gutsy to boot even with Nvidia 7300 GS card i have?
00:05	<capiira>	axjv but you could code it in flex
00:05	<MTughan>	locellcount: It was Sans in Feisty too. Sans Bold for titles, and Monospace for fixed-width.
00:05	<Lamego>	Jacob, what error do you get ?
00:05	<axjv>	capiira: Oh, okay. Well what was that other program you mentioned?
00:05	<Slart>	demon_spork: it didn't work for me neither (using 880 gtx)
00:05	<garu>	pppo_dude what's with the message u sent me? :s
00:05	<Xore|work>	say no to most recent packages, do them in a week or tomorrow or when the servers aren't loaded down
00:05	<Lamego>	Jacob, if are using the main mirror, you may ne unable to install packages due to the high server load
00:05	<stray77>	garu, are you using cable in canada by chance?
00:05	<capiira>	axjv also don't have that
00:05	<locellcount>	MTughan: weird, it looks totally different since the update... Ah well
00:05	<buntunub>	!ubotu fubar
00:05	<ubotwo>	Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
00:05	<sco50000>	this is a very busy channel
00:05	<demon_spork>	Slart, so did the install work from the text installer?
00:05	<garu>	pppoe_dude what's with the message u sent me? :s
00:05	<axjv>	capiira: Or somebody else said dia?
00:05	<Slart>	demon_spork: oh.. I upgraded.. didn't install from scratch..
00:05	<locellcount>	MTughan: Cheers for looking though, appreciate it
00:05	<garu>	stray77 I'm using cable in London!lol
00:06	<MTughan>	Anytime.
00:06	<jacob_>	Lamego never mind, and it's jacob_ not jacob, it now went nevermind, thx anyways
00:06	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: yes?
00:06	<buntunub>	!ubotu xorg.conf
00:06	<ubotwo>	The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type « sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart » in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
00:06	<demon_spork>	Slart, I want to see a clean install of gutsy before I determine it is worth upgrading
00:06	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	i installed from live cd so while i surfed the net  unbuntu did its ting
00:06	<Slart>	demon_spork: but that new failsafe x thingy just died when I tried to run it.. so much for being failsafe
00:06	<capiira>	axjv dia is like ms visio maybe it has a such function
00:06	<pazsion>	instal hangs after .. it tries to get online during install
00:06	<oklopol>	i'm trying to run gedit remotely, and it says "The application 'gedit' lost its connection to the display localhost:10.0; most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed the application."
00:06	<the_darkside_986>	i used torrents to get "ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso" or whatever it's called... that's the release version isn't it?
00:06	<stray77>	garu, thats why, both rogers and cogeco are bandwidth shaping and using QoS to kill torrents
00:06	<hipitihop>	Colro, and example from my fstab to get you going: //192.168.0.3/pictures-archive /mnt/pictures-archive cifs rw,exec,credentials=/etc/cifspw 0 100
00:06	<Slart>	demon_spork: I wouldn't have upgraded if I knew how much trouble I would have
00:06	<garu>	stray77 rogers and cogeco...? :s!lol
00:06	<demon_spork>	Slart, I figured out how to do it!!!!!!
00:07	<Maarten>	I swear.... I never before noticed there is a MINESWEEPER game in the console version of aptitude
00:07	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	Slart:  i had no probs what so ever and im on a really poor puter
00:07	<stray77>	'fraid so
00:07	<MTughan>	Hmm... That's really odd. Edubuntu is downloading much faster than Ubuntu on BitTorrent.
00:07	<pppoe_dude>	garu, what message
00:07	<Slart>	demon_spork: oh? spread the wisdom..
00:07	<demon_spork>	Slart, just hit Alt+Ctrl+Backspace and it loads
00:07	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: that is not an i810 problem, that is because the servers are being swamped by millions of people all upgrading at once
00:07	<the_darkside_986>	i envy all of you? i just want to install and use the gutsy livecd like i would normally always do. i'm not going to settle for text-based installation or any alternate cd's :(
00:07	<axjv>	capiira: I have an idea: Can the trial of Illustrator work on Wine?
00:07	<hipitihop>	Colro, the key is the credentials=
00:07	<Slart>	demon_spork: so.. restart X and it works? well.. that wasn't so hard
00:07	<capiira>	axjv dunno i never used wine
00:07	<demon_spork>	Slart, I don't know why, but just restarting X after the live boot worked
00:07	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	the have you got the live cd ?
00:08	<capiira>	axjv but you could run xp inside vmware or virtual box and use illustrator there
00:08	<demon_spork>	Slart, do you want to try it so we can make a post about it on the forums?
00:08	<younan1>	bluefox83 the problem fixed itself eventually? just kept trying?
00:08	<ppls>	need help: misclicked and interrupted ext3 format... can i return my NTFS partition back? (cfdisk says fatal eror: cannot open disk drive)
00:08	<garu>	pppoe_dude 00:03:30	<ubotu>	pppoe_dude wants you to know: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
00:08	<demon_spork>	Slart, if it is a working solution
00:08	<Slart>	demon_spork: I'll have to try that.... I had to roll back to my old xorg.conf etc by hand before I could get anything up and running
00:08	<capiira>	axjv or dual boot
00:08	<stray77>	garu, id call them up and complain.
00:08	<dn4>	is it wise to go from ubuntustudio to an upgrade of Gutsy?:
00:08	<stray77>	tell them to quit F$%#ing with your bandwidth
00:08	<axjv>	capiira: Well, my windows partition died on me, so I don't think that's an option.
00:08	<administrator>	ha
00:09	<Slart>	demon_spork: unfortunately I don't have an install CD for gutsy... and I'm guessing the download servers are slowly melting as we speak
00:09	<skyrocker67>	its a cannot allocate pci-bridge 7 of 8 about 7-8 times on boot
00:09	<MTughan>	#wehatevista still exists...
00:09	<bluefox83>	younan1, actually i opted to get a torrent and i'll burn it to cd and install later when the servers aren't so bogged down
00:09	<clmbngbkng>	if i've been updating gutsy all the way since beta started i should have the final product right now, right?
00:09	<younan1>	bluefox83, my var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log says at the bottom "ERROR pre-requists item 'http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/r/release-upgrader-dpkg/release-upgrader-dpkg_1.14.5ubuntu11.2_i386.udeb' is NOT trusted"
00:09	<capiira>	axjv you can also code it in flex/flash and link to a xml file with numbers then you will never need to draw a pie chart again
00:09	<pazsion>	murkymurk, check your PM's
00:09	<Xore|work>	Slart: your solution is known as "bittorrent"
00:09	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	tried apt-get install comiz it aint getting it
00:09	<axjv>	capiira: How difficult would that be?
00:09	<rayb0t>	i am trying to get the torrent, it is being rather slow to connect to the tracker apparently
00:09	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: checked, none there
00:10	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	bittorents  bad i like utorrent
00:10	<garu>	stray77 nah...no biggie...
00:10	<Slart>	Xore|work: hehe.. yea..the torrent should work
00:10	<demon_spork>	Slart, it took me like an hour and a half using the torrent
00:10	<younan1>	bluefox83, why wait for the servers to clear up if you downloaded the iso? (im guessing the alternate)
00:10	<capiira>	axjv you would need to learn actionscript 3
00:10	<kitche>	Unbutu[G33Z3R: huh utorrent is used for bittorrents
00:10	<Xore|work>	i downloaded gutsy server in 10 minutes w/ torrent
00:10	<capiira>	axjv but i think adobe also have afew examples online
00:10	<stray77>	bittorrent is a different application than utorrent.
00:10	<ppls>	can anyone help noob with partitioning?
00:10	<axjv>	capiira: I think I'll save that for another day. Or if there is some sort of script I can just input my data into...
00:10	<pppoe_dude>	garu, Oct 18 18:47:01
00:10	<MTughan>	Xore|work: That's better than I'm doing...
00:10	<rayb0t>	the tracker is refusing my connection :(
00:10	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	huh but utorrent  not linux i have to download  rtorrent
00:10	<murkyMurk>	yeah, alex jones is back..he's funny
00:10	<stray77>	same function tho
00:10	<clmbngbkng>	if i've been updating gutsy all the way since beta started i should have the final product right now, right?
00:10	<sisseck>	does anyone remember where the settings for GRUB is located? want computer to boot XP as default
00:10	<Xore|work>	desktop and alternate took longer, but no more than an hour
00:11	<rayb0t>	sisseck: /boot/grub
00:11	<IRKempo>	sisseck: /boot/grub/menu.lst
00:11	<carlhako>	quick q, just installed gutsy on laptop where are settings for compiz key bindings etc?
00:11	<sisseck>	thanks
00:11	<murkyMurk>	clmbngbkng: yep
00:11	<Keef_>	hi, just a quick question, before I wipe my windows, what's the likely-hood of having problems with two monitors with a 8600GT on the new release?
00:11	<bluefox83>	not the alternate..and because since i got the cd iso it's going to have to download from the servers anyways, the servers are very bogged down right now..so i'm going to wait it out a bit
00:11	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	ok apt-get instal compiz aint working says  nothing found
00:11	<pppoe_dude>	garu, EDT

00:11	<kst->	is there a way to increase performance in ubuntu gutsy again by switching off Xgl on the fly? I need it for gaming.. best would be without having to re-login :)
00:11	<murkyMurk>	Keef_: slim
00:11	<erichj>	gnome-compiz
00:11	<MTughan>	While Edubuntu is less than 20 minutes left...
00:11	<garu>	pppoe_dude ????????????????
00:11	<kitche>	kst-: well if you use Xgl you need to logoff to get rid of it
00:12	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	so i should type apt-get gnome-compiz?
00:12	<BUDD}{A>	got a small question how can i get transparent menus in ubuntu 7.10
00:12	<garu>	pppoe_dude what's EDT|
00:12	<garu>	pppoe_dude what's EDT?
00:12	<kst->	I think I do, using proprietary ati drivers coz the free ones are much slower :)
00:12	<pppoe_dude>	garu, eastern daylight time
00:12	<Xore|work>	MTughan: maybe when your edubuntu is done, your client will give more pipe to your ubuntu desktop
00:12	<younan1>	bluefox83 thanks for your input, i'll just try to be more patient, bt if it doesn't work out i'll just get the iso and do a clean install
00:12	<garu>	pppoe_dude ooohh..ok!
00:12	<MTughan>	Xore|work: Ubuntu was started before Edubuntu.
00:12	<Colro>	How can I mount a DVD image?
00:12	<pppoe_dude>	garu, GMT -0500

00:13	<garu>	can someone tell me what's the big difference between the livedvd and the livecd?is it just the fact that the livedvd has more packages?

00:13	<Abraxas_>	I'm on the DRI troubleshooting page and it doesn't seem to be helping me
00:13	<sivik>	astronaught, thats probably because the cd is burned badly
00:13	<capiira>	axjv http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/flexbuilder_linux/
00:13	<stray77>	astronaught, did you check the md5sums?
00:14	<Unbutu[G33Z3R>	ta stray77 much appreciated
00:14	<murkyMurk>	Megaqwerty: you need to install/enable aiglx on ati
00:14	<kitche>	Abraxas_: see if you have load dri commented or not in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
00:14	<Abraxas_>	dmesg | grep drm <----gives me blank
00:14	<sivik>	what happened to our bot
00:14	<madsy_>	who do i open port 6112?
00:14	<MTughan>	sivik: Did he stick it in a fire? :P
00:14	<Megaqwerty>	murkyMurk: so, frglx doesn't work?
00:14	<astronaught>	sivik: can i run md5sum on my /dev/hdc device?  will that work as a check?
00:14	<kas1>	I have ubuntu on my laptop but want to put it on a friend's old computer.  she's running windows ME right now (horrid, I know).  Anyway, for some reason I can get to the install screen from the cd but then it goes to "(initramfs)" type of prompt....any ideas?
00:14	<capiira>	axjv with that you can create *.swf files
00:14	<sivik>	astronaught, it might
00:14	<pazsion>	murkymurk, check your PMS
00:14	<garu>	murkyMurk do I get all the packages by doing a sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade from the livecd installed?or not really?
00:14	<Abraxas_>	kitche, I've added load dri because it wasn't there...sadly, after restarting X, "grep -i "Direct rendering" /var/log/Xorg.0.log" is giving me a blank response
00:14	<Deryk>	i want to be able to do everything i want in a specific directory called /testserver (create/edit/delete directories and files), even if the contents gets updated (new directories etc) without having to do anything at all (only right now).. how to do that?
00:14	<xtlosx>	anyone?
00:14	<sivik>	how do i get aclocal installed
00:14	<astronaught>	sivik: is there another way to check the CD checksum?
00:14	<the_darkside_986>	how do i make X server work During the liveCD?
00:14	<axjv>	capiira: This seems a bit overkill to me, but whatever you say o.o
00:14	<murkyMurk>	Megaqwerty: that is the end of my ati knowledge
00:14	<ppls>	hello ppl, i am in need of advice. Im new to ubuntu and second time install i made a mistake: clicked use entire disk instead of manual when prompted for partitioning; so i interupded it after a few sec and it seems my entire disk is gone. what can i do to rescue partitions?
00:15	<oklopol>	i'm trying to run gedit remotely, and it says "The application 'gedit' lost its connection to the display localhost:10.0; most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed the application."
00:15	<Megaqwerty>	murkyMurk: heh, alright, thanks
00:15	<the_darkside_986>	it wouldn't let me edit xorg.conf the last time and it looked like a cropped file
00:15	<sivik>	astronaught, there should be an option during the boot to check the cd
00:15	<Deryk>	you cant ppls
00:15	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: I HAVE NO PRIVATE MESSAGES
00:15	<xtlosx>	How do I change the ubuntu mirror I am using... this particiular machine is having problems getting to us.archive.ubuntu.com
00:15	<madsy_>	who do i open port 6112? enyone?
00:15	<kitche>	Abraxas_: well glxinfo|grep direct rendering will tell you but if you use the nvidia driver you don't need load dri in your xorg.conf anymore
00:15	<astronaught>	sivik: I get the same message when I select that too...
00:15	<sivik>	the us always suck
00:15	<Deryk>	ppls: after a format, everything gets lost
00:15	<sivik>	astronaught, then you might want to burn a different disc
00:15	<capiira>	axjv just a solution maybe not the easiert but the most effective if you need to do that often
00:15	<astronaught>	sivik: right-o.  thanks.
00:15	<Megaqwerty>	xtlosx: System>Administration>Software Sources
00:15	<sivik>	it seems like there is something wrong with it
00:15	<stray77>	madsy_, on what? your router?
00:15	<kas1>	ppls, if it hasn't actually done anything yet, how about taking the drive out and trying to put it on a computer as the slave drive, then just transfer what you need?
00:15	<ppls>	deryk, read on forums it might b returned...
00:16	<demon_spork>	I am having trouble mounting ntfs partitions from the gutsy livecd
00:16	<DB42>	no #ubuntu+1 ?
00:16	<Abraxas_>	kitche: I had thought that... I just added it as a last resort before coming here... it's giving me "no" and suggesting I use LIBGL_DEBUG =verbose...having used that on glxgears I get no debugging info
00:16	<ppls>	emm im using live cd and i cant do anything with it
00:16	<xtlosx>	OK, it will allow me to change the mirrors?
00:16	<DB42>	why doesn't update-manager -d work on getting 7.04->7.10 ?
00:16	<Deryk>	i want to be able to do everything i want in a specific directory called /testserver (create/edit/delete directories and files), even if the contents gets updated (new directories etc) without having to do anything at all (only right now).. how to do that?
00:16	<DB42>	it's just stuck...
00:16	<xtlosx>	Do i just need to look on the ubuntu site, and pick anothe mirror
00:16	<gnomefreak>	DB42: no -d
00:16	<MTughan>	DB42: Gutsy is so new, we don't need it right now.
00:16	<DB42>	frost^: shalom
00:16	<the_darkside_986>	is anyone else facing an unusable liveCD due to Nvidia cards?

00:16	<ale[x]>	I'm trying to do a automated (preseed) install in vmware but can't get past "Detecting hardware to find CD-ROM drives" which fails, can anyone point me in the right direction.
00:16	<Megaqwerty>	xtlosx: just pick another mirror using System>Administration>Software Sources
00:16	<DB42>	so how can  i update to 7.10 ?
00:17	<kitche>	Abraxas_: do this grep -i nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf to see if you are using the nvidia binary driver
00:17	<xtlosx>	K, thanks
00:17	<ver1982>	it will resume

00:17	<madsy_>	stray77: i must open a port to wc3 on bnet
00:17	<stray77>	madsy_, do you have a router?
00:17	<fjleon>	guys i have a 320 GB drive. When i try to resize it in the installer, i want to just use 20 gb of space for ubuntu, but if i resize even to 100% the size would be 205.9 GB. what am i doing wrong?
00:17	<MTughan>	DB42: 7.10 is the latest version. You can get it from Ubuntu.com.
00:17	<murkyMurk>	Deryk: use the -R switch on chown and chgrp commands
00:17	<Abraxas_>	kitche: I put it in there by hand, so I must be...but I just ran that grep as a sanity check and I do have Driver "nvidia"
00:17	<gnomefreak>	MTughan: hes upgrading
00:17	<DB42>	gnomefreak: it's stuck

00:17	<DB42>	MTughan, i wanna UPDATE not get it
00:17	<gnomefreak>	DB42: at what point?
00:17	<Deryk>	i tried chmod
00:17	<the_darkside_986>	if my xorg.conf file is ****'d up again then I will blame k3b or my dvd drive for burning a bad image... :(
00:17	<MTughan>	Sorry, DB42...
00:17	<DB42>	gnomefreak, : clicking "update"
00:17	<DB42>	it seems stuck to other people here as well
00:17	<murkyMurk>	sivik: odd, it always works ;-)
00:18	<ver1982>	DB42, just try again
00:18	<madsy_>	stray77: all the ports on the router are open
00:18	<sivik>	murkyMurk, yes i know its odd
00:18	<Deryk>	i did: chmod -R 777 /testserver
00:18	<kas1>	PROBLEM: installing ubuntu 7.10 on old computer.  cd loads, hit start install, but then it goes to prompt: "(initramfs)"    I've looked online and not found an answer for the last couple days
00:18	<Deryk>	and it doesnt work
00:18	<DB42>	why doesn't it tell @ what point it's stuck..
00:18	<the_darkside_986>	ok i will see if the "more" command will actually display the whole xorg file so wish me luck everyone. bye bye.
00:18	<kitche>	DB42: it might be due to the servers being hammered by thousands of users
00:18	<gnomefreak>	DB42: i need to know if the little window shows up at all
00:18	<gnomefreak>	.win 19
00:18	<DB42>	gnomefreak, nop
00:18	<sivik>	how do i install aclocal
00:18	<ppls>	what i want to know is: is it possible to use rescue tools to rescue files if format(ext3) was interupted
00:18	<mjkelly93>	murkymurk: so i just restarted because it was saying no sound cards were found, i logged back in, and it worked
00:18	<murkyMurk>	Deryk: say you want user tom to own /test then use sudo chgrp tom /test -R
00:18	<stray77>	madsy_, so youre saying your machine is in the DMZ?
00:18	<gnomefreak>	DB42: ok close update-manager

00:24	<element>	usb headphones

00:24	<element>	i need a master on thm
00:24	<Abraxas_>	(maybe I'm just grasping at straws but .........someone?)
00:24	<Meroigo_>	Sjano >	Compiz Fusion is included in the latest version of Ubuntu, 7.10
00:24	<element>	so i can control them instead of my speakers
00:24	<Deryk>	i want to be able to do everything i want in a specific directory called /testserver (create/edit/delete directories and files), even if the contents gets updated (new directories etc) without having to do anything at all (only right now).. how to do that? (I mounted /testserver with sshfs)
00:24	<murkyMurk>	Deryk: only seen that on a corrupted directory
00:24	<theAtom>	Abraxas_, do you need some straws?
00:24	<witless>	does compiz support i915 driver (intel 82G965) ?
00:25	<Vista|G33Z3R>	it does? ahhh then my graphics card isnt supported
00:25	<LjL>	!packages
00:25	<Deryk>	it isnt corrupt murkyMurk , its mounted
00:25	<mikebot>	MTughan, Is it after that part of installing?
00:25	<fjleon>	manual install says /dev/sda1 is 320062 MB and has 8 mb of free space
00:25	<bmk789>	Deryk: chmod 777 <dir>
00:25	<element>	and it doesn't work in all programs
00:25	<kitche>	theAtom: ok I won't but it's the same way as you upgrade feisty and such if you ran that
00:25	<oklopol>	i'm trying to run gedit remotely, and it says "The application 'gedit' lost its connection to the display localhost:10.0; most likely the X server was shut down or you killed/destroyed the application."
00:25	<element>	can someone help?
00:25	<pradeep>	which is the iso for 64-bit intel arch?
00:25	<Abraxas_>	theAtom, preferably some manpages... I can't seem to get DRI working and I've been through 6 or 7 seperate "troubleshooting" guides for it...
00:25	<murkyMurk>	Deryk: try this though sudo chmod 666 <dir>
00:25	<flagel>	has it been confirmed that the gobuntu-7.10-alternate-i386.iso is faulty?
00:25	<monkeyBox>	Any iPhone users here?  How hard is it to get it to work w/ linux (at least to transfer music & video)?
00:25	<theAtom>	kitche, ok thanks
00:25	<MTughan>	mikebot: I can't remember. I haven't installed Gutsy yet.
00:25	<LjL>	!packages >	Sjano    (Sjano, see the private message from Ubotu)
00:25	<fjleon>	DB42: so it is using almost all disk space
00:25	<murkyMurk>	Deryk: 666 not 777
00:25	<DB42>	fjleon, whats the prob ?
00:25	<theAtom>	Abraxas_, whats DRI?
00:25	<soundray>	oklopol: how are you connecting?
00:25	<theAtom>	!DRI
00:25	<mikebot>	MTughan, OK, thanks.

00:25	<Deryk>	i get permission denied murkyMurk
00:25	<southafrikanse>	hello. My CDROM device doesn't mount automatically with DVDs
00:25	<Vista|G33Z3R>	<<< ati xpress 200 isnt supported mind you ATI are very bad at drivers
00:25	<DB42>	any israelies here ?
00:26	<dn4>	man
00:26	<MTughan>	Vista|G33Z3R: compiz works on my Radeon 9600.
00:26	<dn4>	I just messaged ubotu bot for mirrors
00:26	<oklopol>	soundray: i have openssh-server running on my linux machine, and using putty on my windows machine...
00:26	<bmk789>	Deryk: 664 might work best depending on the folder and its use
00:26	<Abraxas_>	theAtom, Direct Rendering Interface..basically nvidia GLX...the nvidia-glx drivers are installed, and I have what -seems- like some level of acceleration, but glxinfo tells me Direct Rendering: no   ..and cedega laughs at me
00:26	<soundray>	mikebot: you need the alternate CD to upgrade. With the Desktop CD, you can only do a fresh install.
00:26	<ubotwo>	LjL: Error: That person could not be found in any channel you're in
00:26	<ubotwo>	dri is direct rendering infrastructure, a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware under the X Window System in a safe and efficient manner.
00:26	<fjleon>	DB42: i want to resize the 320 gb partition to 295gb, but when i drag the slider to 100% it shows 295 gb (it should be 92% or something, so i am afraid to install)
00:26	<ubotwo>	Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
00:26	<element>	!calc 5+5
00:26	<theAtom>	Abraxas_, ouch
00:26	<mikebot>	soundray, argh, so what do I need?
00:26	<|Flood|>	ubuntu website should offer it as a torrent
00:26	<dn4>	\o/
00:26	<DB42>	fjleon, ahh, dunno :|
00:26	<element>	i have a problem with my usb headphones
00:26	<d2dchat>	does anyone know if when i press the cancel button on the Fiesty to Gutsy upgrade whether or not it will start off where i left off?
00:26	<soundray>	oklopol: do you have an X server for Windows?
00:27	<Vista|G33Z3R>	MTughan:  is xpress 200m radeon 9600? only asking cos im noob at this
00:27	<flagel>	who should one talk to about a faulty release-iso?
00:27	<fjleon>	DB42: is ubuntu reserving 20gb as minimum and thus shows 100% as 295 gb?
00:27	<element>	i need to add a master to them
00:27	<d2dchat>	if i connect from another machine?
00:27	<kitche>	Abraxas_: by chance are you running xgl but I do know compiz-fusion does take accel away on some cards for a some reason
00:27	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, no
00:27	<element>	so i can control them
00:27	<d2dchat>	err internet
00:27	<murkyMurk>	Deryk: well, your system is telling you that no one owns that directory and that it is returning no access rights
00:27	<witless>	d2dchat: how long have you been downloading?
00:27	<DB42>	fjleon, i don't know
00:27	<MTughan>	Vista|G33Z3R: No, it's not, but you said that ATI sucked at drivers.
00:27	<magic_ninja>	has anyone gotten their mic working with wine and steam
00:27	<DB42>	night ppl
00:27	<barnaby>	system-administration-update manager
00:27	<kitche>	flagel: you sure it's faulty?
00:27	<d2dchat>	witless, like 2 hours
00:27	<amr>	in the www.postman.net it's not reliable " it says and there is no sign up
00:27	<witless>	damn.  i just started
00:27	<Vista|G33Z3R>	MTughan:  yea my drivers lol
00:27	<Sjano>	thanks for the answers, everyone
00:27	<Abraxas_>	kitche, I've got beryl open..so I guess the answer is yes...I can always step out of that and hope it works
00:27	<southafrikanse>	hello. My CDROM device doesn't mount automatically with DVDs
00:27	<kas1>	anyone seen "(initramfs)" when installing ubuntu?
00:27	<|Flood|>	magic_ninja see element
00:27	<soundray>	!alternate >	mikebot, please read the message from ubotu
00:27	<ubotwo>	soundray: Error: That person could not be found in any channel you're in
00:27	<MTughan>	Vista|G33Z3R: Actually, you can blame AMD now.
00:27	<oklopol>	soundray: i do not.
00:28	<amr>	ok which is better gmail, yahoomail,hotmail
00:28	<WorkingOnWise>	LjL: thanks.
00:28	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, really? it deletes everything? :(
00:28	<oklopol>	do i install it?
00:28	<flagel>	kitche: the md5 are correct, I checked twice, but the installer says a package is corrupt
00:28	<witless>	amr: gmail
00:28	<pradeep>	Which 6.10 ISO should I use for 64-bit Intel x86?
00:28	<soundray>	oklopol: gedit requires an X server to display on the local machine. Use nano instead.
00:28	<theAtom>	Abraxas_, u may need to use MS Windows for games then
00:28	<cousin_luigi>	hello
00:28	<kitche>	flagel: probbaly means you got a bad download
00:28	<Abraxas_>	kitche,  actually..it looks to me like Beryl defaulted to Metacity and the like
00:28	<d2dchat>	witless, im at 637 of 1300
00:28	<cousin_luigi>	just installed gutsy
00:28	<jarrod_>	what is the name of the wire that comes from a lcd and connect directly into the mother board in a laptop?
00:28	<amr>	witless can you tell me why do you think so
00:28	<Vista|G33Z3R>	MTughan:  no matter i like what ive seen so far and i might even ditch me vista
00:28	<bmk789>	pradeep: why 6.10? you mean 7.10?
00:28	<d2dchat>	1305*
00:28	<Abraxas_>	theAtom, Windows won't run on this box due to some corrupt memory blocks; i've never bothered to troubleshoot
00:28	<xerawx>	the download page sent me to "ubuntu-7.10-desktop-amd64.iso" is that for intel 64-bit as well?
00:28	<pradeep>	bmk789, sorry .. i meant the 7.10
00:28	<witless>	d2dchat: i burned a cd at work but didn't bring it home  :-(
00:28	<oklopol>	soundray: i have X11 enabled on putty
00:28	<oklopol>	doesn't that help?
00:28	<theAtom>	Abraxas_, ok
00:28	<MTughan>	Score one for open-source... Thanks Vista|G33Z3R.
00:28	<flagel>	kitche: no, I md5ed the iso, it's correct, I also md5ed the packages on the CD so it's not a bad burn
00:29	<Abraxas_>	bad ram + hot HD = DOA
00:29	<kitche>	flagel: but then again I don't download release isos at the same time as anyone else so I don't run into that problem
00:29	<soundray>	oklopol: not unless you have X on Windows.
00:29	<|Flood|>	-=<( anybody tried it in a VPC 2007 VM )>=-
00:29	<pradeep>	bmk789, should i use the 64-bit AMD one?
00:29	<Abraxas_>	i've come so far though...all i need is DRI running and i'm all set
00:29	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, I think so. It's says in the beginning that upgrade installation must complete without interruptions
00:29	<oklopol>	soundray: i see. X server then?
00:29	<oklopol>	do i dl that?
00:29	<bmk789>	pradeep: if you really want to use 64 bit, there may be some issues
=== slimjimAFK is now known as slimjimflim
00:29	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, who is serving this ? It's not going that fast
00:29	<sisseck>	anyone know why ALL the programs i can install are marked as not working on my computer since it is a i386?? and what exactly is a i386?
00:29	<Vista|G33Z3R>	MTughan:  this is by far the easiest linux install ive seen  i tried playing with redhat a few times but gave up but  i like this its userfriendly
00:29	<Surb>	d2dchat, are you using the update manager?
00:29	<soundray>	oklopol: I think you can get one as part of Cygwin. But I don't know anything else about it.
00:30	<barnaby>	I heard that X on ati drivers blanks in 7.10. nyone seen this problem?
00:30	<d2dchat>	Surb, yes
00:30	<flagel>	kitche: any idea who one should talk to?
00:30	<Surb>	d2dchat, i've had to cancel mine a couple times, and it kept all my files
00:30	<bmk789>	sisseck: i386 is the base platform of x86
00:30	<MTughan>	Vista|G33Z3R: Hehe... http://www.userfriendly.org/
00:30	<hellcattrav>	hey why would sunbird run on my ubuntu install but not fedora 7?
00:30	<d2dchat>	Surb, awesome! Good to know
00:30	<alves_rn>	anyone install ubuntu in Dell OPTIPLEX 320
00:30	<cousin_luigi>	I can't change a sandy background right after login, seems to be related to gdm but not sure where to set it
00:30	<Surb>	d2dchat, it was a bit slow to start during the Preparing the upgrade phase, though, so be wary of that.
00:30	<cousin_luigi>	any hints?
00:30	<kitche>	flagel: the ubuntu devs of course
00:30	<sebastes>	barnaby: Are you asking about the restricted drivers?
00:30	<d2dchat>	Surb, why is that?
00:30	<Surb>	d2dchat, no clue.
00:30	<sisseck>	bmk789: but shouldnt most of the programs in the add/remove window work then?
00:30	<pazsion>	grr
00:30	<soundray>	oklopol: my channel list doesn't work. Perhaps you can check for yourself whether there is a cygwin channel.
00:30	<d2dchat>	Surb, alright well i canceled
00:30	<kitche>	flagel: but they most likely will tell you to wait a few days and try to redownload the iso
00:30	<d2dchat>	Surb, thank you!
00:30	<|Flood|>	i bet this channel get real busy in the middle of the night :)
00:31	<bmk789>	sisseck: yes, why?
00:31	<nickrud>	cousin_luigi: system-admin-login window, second tab
00:31	<MTughan>	|Flood|: Why do you say that?
00:31	<jazz>	hi
00:31	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: thanks, trying now
00:31	<murkyMurk>	|Flood|: it IS the middle of the night
00:31	<jazz>	can someone help me
00:31	<soundray>	|Flood|: the middle of the night is now.
00:31	<|Flood|>	geeks dont sleep
00:31	<xerawx>	this channel is unusable most of the time
00:31	<pradeep>	bmk789, I understand that there would be some packages etc ... but I don't want to install 32-bit
00:31	<flagel>	kitche: how do I get ahold of the devs?
00:31	<|Flood|>	maybe for youz :)
00:31	<MTughan>	murkyMurk: Only 7:30PM EDIT.
00:31	<soundray>	xerawx: you are using it
00:31	<Vista|G33Z3R>	jazz ask the question
00:31	<pazsion>	ok gnome is trying to connect on a computer that has no connection, how do i bypass this and continue install?
00:31	<dinian>	I have a Sony Vaio laptop that does not suspend / hibernate with gutsy. What is a good place to start reading for possible solutions?
00:31	<element>	also
00:31	<barnaby>	<sebastes>no just my video card- I'm a little leery about upgrading till they work out some bugs
00:31	<kitche>	flagel: launchpad
00:31	<fjleon>	pradeep:  64 bit is useless unless you have more than 4 gb of ram
00:31	<element>	how would i update to gusty
00:31	<murkyMurk>	MTughan: 00:30 tomorrow here
00:31	<bmk789>	pradeep: then yes that is the right one to download for 64bit
00:31	<xerawx>	soundray: no actually i'm not
00:31	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: that's already set how I want it
00:31	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, you know that in the beginning everyone wants to download
00:31	<sebastes>	barnaby: The open source ATI driver works fine for me
00:32	<LjL>	xerawx: that's partly due to people making irrelevant statement rather than just support questions and answers
00:32	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: the sandy background appears only after login
00:32	<zaphodmcmillan>	hi
00:32	<Davy_Jones>	!upgrade
00:32	<Mark76>	Anyone ever managed to get Siims 2 working under Linux?
00:32	<karnage42>	yeah, the restricted ati driver is working great for me in 6.10
00:32	<ubotwo>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
00:32	<MTughan>	murkyMurk: West coast of Africa?
00:32	<fjleon>	pradeep: there isn't an advantage otherwise of going 64 bit, software will not work, use 32 bit
00:32	<Vista|G33Z3R>	element put live cd in  drive  browse the web  while you install
00:32	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, I know this, but it would be nice if you could select your download locations
00:32	<soundray>	fjleon: that's not true. 64bit is also faster for memory-intensive apps
00:32	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, I took about 2 hours to have Ubuntu upgraded
00:32	<nickrud>	xerawx: use xchat (not xchat gnome) and right click the channel tab to turn off join/part
00:32	<Abraxas_>	Mark76, good luck! :)
00:32	<Davy_Jones>	!gutsy
00:32	<ubotwo>	Gutsy Gibbon is the code name for the next release of Ubuntu (7.10) | (due October 18th, 2007) | It is development software, and as such unstable, support _only_ in #ubuntu+1 | See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyGibbon for more information
00:32	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, and perhaps have bittorrent server setup
00:32	<murkyMurk>	MTughan: lol, no london
00:32	<element>	i have 7.04
00:32	<bmk789>	Mark76: check the wine appdb
00:32	<jazz>	I have a ntfs drive (formatted using dos fdisk and partition magic 8 ) and i want to write to it, but it wont allow me, i have another ntfs drive which is windows ( duel boot ) and i can do nething iw ant to it,
00:32	<pradeep>	fjleon, well I have 2 GB of 800Mhz ram
00:32	<barnaby>	sebastes: did you upgrade pdate manager from feisty? the
00:32	<element>	i want to update to 7.10
00:32	<olive>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes <-- no 7.10 ?
00:32	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: and before the user background gets loaded
00:32	<magic_ninja>	|Flood|: you mean PM element?
00:32	<pradeep>	fjleon, ok :(
00:32	<MTughan>	murkyMurk: Gah, I need to work on my timezones...
00:32	<Mark76>	The Wine what?
00:32	<fjleon>	soundray: not true unless it uses more than 4 gb, like i already said
00:32	<element>	i used to just reinstall
00:32	<amidaniel>	Anyone familiar with winetools? I'm having difficulty installing the MFC framework through it, as the URL it's using is outdated. Was hoping someone might point me toward a way to fix it
00:32	<zaphodmcmillan>	does anyone have any experience with ubuntu and intel macs?
00:32	<element>	but now i dont wan't to do that anymore
00:32	<bmk789>	Mark76: http://appdb.winehq.org
00:33	<nickrud>	cousin_luigi: hm,
00:33	<|Flood|>	ooooooook then i'm a install it myself in a
00:33	<ANTDx1>	i hope they fixed the tracker bug
00:33	<soundray>	!upgrade >	element
00:33	<magic_ninja>	element: you got ur mic working in steam
00:33	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, when you upgrade I think it's not possible to do that
00:33	<sebastes>	barnaby: Yeah, I upgraded using the alternate cd to avoid hammering the servers more, just tell it to not update using the latest online sources
00:33	<element>	my mic works in vent
00:33	<|Flood|>	ooooooook then i'm a install it myself in a VPC VM and home for the best
00:33	<soundray>	fjleon: sorry, you've got it wrong.
00:33	<fjleon>	pradeep: forget the problems of 64 and just use 32 bit, all your software will work at the same speed
00:33	<Vista|G33Z3R>	element have you burned the live cd as an iso?
00:33	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: yes, I'm perplexed as well
00:33	<Mark76>	Okay tahnks bmj
00:33	<element>	ventril
00:33	<sisseck>	bmk789: did you get my IM?
00:33	<murkyMurk>	elementyou got ventrillo working in linux?
00:33	<bmk789>	sisseck: no
00:33	<Mark76>	TA Bmk
00:33	<soundray>	fjleon: memory throughput is faster with 64, even if you have less than 4GB
00:33	<kitche>	fjleon: 64bit is useless to a desktop user completely
00:33	<magic_ninja>	element: really hoping to get it working under cs
00:33	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: and it's not there if I skip gdm and do a startx from init 3
00:33	<nickrud>	cousin_luigi: I can't log out right now to check for myself, sorry
00:33	<barnaby>	sebastes: thanks. No problems yet?
00:33	<sebastes>	barnaby: The only issue I had was the lack of window borders, you just need to turn compiz off and install compizconfig-settings-manager
00:33	<|Flood|>	magic_ninja element has a mic problem too but that's all i know
00:33	<Abraxas_>	now this is odd.. NONE of the NVIDIA blocks in my Xorg.0.log show errors
00:33	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, yea i was just saying it would be nice to be able to choose the medium for which you download the upgrades
00:33	<Abraxas_>	so I don't get it
00:33	<cousin_luigi>	thanks anyway nickrud:)
00:33	<MTughan>	kitche: Unless you're running video editing or something.
00:33	<pradeep>	fjleon, I read someplace in the forums that the package difference between 64 and 32 bit is only 1-2%
00:33	<murkyMurk>	element: soz ventrillo in linux?
00:33	<pazsion>	HEY, gnome is trying to connect during install, there is no connection..how do i bypassthis?
00:34	<element>	soz?
00:34	<soundray>	kitche: there are desktop users who run video encoding, 3D processing and similar stuff
00:34	<sisseck>	bmk789 ok the problem is that i cant install any programs from the add/remove windows. they all say something like this: TuxMath cannot be installed on your computer type (i386)
00:34	<pradeep>	fjleon, will I be missing out on a lot of packages?
00:34	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, oh ok
00:34	<element>	i got ventrilo in linux
00:34	<Abraxas_>	in fact, absolutely nothing in that log greps for (EE)
00:34	<barnaby>	sebastes: Yeah, I heard there were some compiz issues.
00:34	<soundray>	pradeep: it can vary *very* widely depending on what the app does.
00:34	<bmk789>	sisseck: what machine is this?
00:34	<fjleon>	soundray: i dont think so, it takes the same cpu cycles to address the first 32 bits of address space, if you would need to address more space then of course 64 bit is faster
00:34	<Vista|G33Z3R>	element burn the cd as an iso
00:34	<element>	and i got counter strike source and CoD working in linux
00:34	<Dan2552>	hey guys, new to ubuntu; got the new 7.10. Installed the ATI driver with the restricted driver manager - but I can't enable desktop effects, i get a composition error
00:34	<wizard__>	hello, is ubuntu safe to upgrade?
00:34	<kitche>	soundray: yes but those aren't desktop users but then again I know someoen that does all that and doesn't use a 64bit machine
00:34	<murkyMurk>	element: is it as an official package or do people still use my old howto?
00:35	<fjleon>	pradeep: well, java, flash and such don't play nice, some other too but i dont install much 3rd party
00:35	<pipegeek>	Well, this is interesting---with compiz enabled in gutsy, alt-shift-tab (reverse alt-tab) doesn't work.
00:35	<element>	i just used wine
00:35	<element>	lol
00:35	<sisseck>	bmk789 a Znote6214W laptop. intel dualcore
00:35	<Abraxas_>	hmm..ok...I'm using Xgl... is there a wya to undo that in Gutsy?
00:35	<element>	didnt need a howto
00:35	<soundray>	kitche: I'm a desktop user who does all that.
00:35	<jazz>	soo nobodies no
00:35	<jagsUT>	i am looking for a .torrent of ubuntu 7.10.....anyone have such a link in here
00:35	<jagsUT>	i can not find one
00:35	<bmk789>	sisseck: 64bit OS or 32?
00:35	<element>	i wish there was a way to make fonts normal in xfire
00:35	<murkyMurk>	element: lol...must've come on leaps and bounds in teh last 5 years lmao
00:35	<pradeep>	soundray, fjleon thanks .. I'll just give it a try. I can always wipe it off and go for the 32 bit. Thanks :)
00:35	<MTughan>	jagsUT: You can find them on Ubuntu.com.
00:35	<Dan2552>	jagsUT: look around in the download section on the site, I found one in the end
00:35	<pazsion>	need to turn off gnome....
00:35	<sisseck>	bmk789: 32 bit
00:35	<jagsUT>	aight....
00:36	<soundray>	fjleon: it's not only about addressing, it's also about moving the data between RAM and CPU.
00:36	<Vista|G33Z3R>	demonoid has  ubuntu 7.10
00:36	<ScorpKing>	i have installed kommander. how do i run it? i can't find it anywhere. :(
00:36	<element>	and my multimedia buttons work
00:36	<Vista|G33Z3R>	so has isohunt
00:36	<pazsion>	trying to instal ubuntu, but gnome is looking fro a connection that doesn't exist
00:36	<Dan2552>	oh my everyone's talking so fast :(
00:36	<kitche>	soundray: true but that's not really a desktop user really a desktop user is one that just uses the internet and email pretty much
00:36	<karnage42>	releases.ubuntu.com/7.10 has some torrent links
00:36	<nickrud>	soundray: what do you recommend for copying non-encrypted video dvd's?
00:36	<southafrikanse>	I'm trying to put WIndows to run by default. Can someone tel me where do I get the default number so I can do so?
00:36	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: pretty much stuck waiting for it, Will be better tomorrow when teh demand is less
00:36	<fjleon>	soundray: how would a 64 bit  cpu help with speed? i can't believe you without a good article supporting your theory
00:36	<bmk789>	sisseck: just a sec
00:36	<tag>	How's the release?
00:36	<MTughan>	Dan2552: You should've seen #ubuntu-release-party last night...
00:36	<bbyman>	if I had Ubuntu 7.1 beta, will the current version of 7.1 automatically update?
00:36	<zaphodmcmillan>	intel macs anyone?
00:37	<element>	my headphones don't work when i play flash in firefox
00:37	<Vista|G33Z3R>	southafrikanse:  you need to  edit grub
00:37	<tag>	bbyman: yes
00:37	<PriceChild>	!final | bbyman
00:37	<ubotwo>	bbyman: If you installed a Tribe/Beta/RC version of Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) and have been keeping it up to date, then you are already running the latest version of Gutsy. To make sure, type « sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade » in a console.
00:37	<amidaniel>	Anyone familiar with winetools? I'm having difficulty installing the MFC framework through it, as the URL it's using is outdated. Was hoping someone might point me toward a way to fix it
00:37	<pazsion>	there is no internet on this machine murkykurk
00:37	<MTughan>	zaphodmcmillan: Yes, but running on OS X with Ubuntu in a VM.
00:37	<wizard__>	7.04 upgrade to 7.10 is it safe??????
00:37	<zaphodmcmillan>	i have that currently
00:37	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, I have grub open but I can't find the number....
00:37	<zaphodmcmillan>	but thinking of trying it nativly
00:37	<thedonvaughn>	bbyman: btw, it is 7.10, 7.1 is different.  it's 10 because it's released in october :)
00:37	<fjleon>	it's not like you have more bandwidth for the cpu-ram interconnection (of course if the cpu is just faster then it will)
00:37	<pazsion>	murkymurk: need to bypas this so i can install to HD
00:37	<zaphodmcmillan>	but dont want to use boot camp
00:37	<soundray>	nickrud: I've never done that, but I'd probably just use nautilus
00:37	<MTughan>	zaphodmcmillan: You need Boot Camp then.
00:37	<pradeep>	fjleon, soundray i read in a lot of places that 64 bit improves performance by 30% approx
00:37	<axjv>	capiira: I found a solution using a java applet and editing some html.
00:37	<ARJones>	wizard__: I did it with 0 issues
00:37	<Vista|G33Z3R>	southafrikanse: you want windows to load first and linux second?
00:37	<axjv>	capiira: Thanks for helping
00:37	<nickrud>	soundray: really? I'd'a never thunk
00:38	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: ahhhh, network less install...hmmm
00:38	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, yes
00:38	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, I'm not the only one using the computer
00:38	<vigrid>	hello, i am running ubuntu 7.04 server. i would like to set it up to accept vpn "dial in" connections from windows clients. could someone point me at a good tutorial please?
00:38	<Vista|G33Z3R>	southafrikanse:  its easy you want me to pm you
00:38	<fjleon>	pradeep: that doesn't make any sense at all. 32 bit OS would be dead by now
00:38	<wizard__>	keep hearing java and other hiccups with gutsy, is that true?
00:38	<Draggin>	Hello hello. New problems...  Tonight, when I wanted to boot into Ubuntu, it went past the logo screen, but before it got to the login manager, the screen just went black and stayed black.  In the virtual console, I then saw that it was complaining about a USB device.  After manually switching them, I finally found that it was my little 56K modem.  Now this modem has been on my system since the day I installed Ubuntu and it's never complai
00:38	<capiira>	axjv nice, np
00:38	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, of course
00:38	<pazsion>	yea, it's kust hangin now...
00:38	<ARJones>	wizard__: i had no problems with java
00:38	<apollo2011>	I am assuming I can't update my repos because the servers are getting hit pretty hard. How do I set up a mirror in my repository list?
00:38	<MTughan>	zaphodmcmillan: As I know, no Linux distro can natively boot from EFI, which is the boot system the Intel Macs use. They all use BIOS, which Boot Camp emulates.
00:38	<soundray>	pradeep: like I said: it depends on the application, the amount of memory I/O it has to perform, and the extent to which it is optimized for 64 bit architectures.
00:38	<axjv>	capiira: If you want to know, the program's name was 'Pie3D'
00:38	<Dan2552>	no idea if anyone answered my question but there were loads of people talking ---- hey guys, new to ubuntu; got the new 7.10. Installed the ATI driver with the restricted driver manager - but I can't enable desktop effects, i get a composition error
00:39	<zaphodmcmillan>	mtughan, thanks
00:39	<wizard__>	kewl ty......will do the upgrade then.... ty again
00:39	<capiira>	axjv thanks i was going to ask you :)
00:39	<ARJones>	Dan2552: Please look at the community documentation for Compiz on ATI cards
00:39	<pradeep>	soundray, isn't the 64 bit ubuntu build optimized for the 64-bit? :)
00:39	<speeb>	I can't seem to add some items to my panels.  Specifically Search, User Switcher, and Weather.  They just don't show up on the panel when I add them. :-(
00:39	<ARJones>	Dan2552: Your instructions on what to do about that are there
00:39	<soundray>	Dan2552: I get that too on an Xpress 200M. It's just not compatible with desktop effects.
00:39	<bmk789>	sisseck: have you modified the sources.list or anything?
00:39	<jazz>	I will ask again. I have a duel boot machine, windows/ubuntu ubuntu is able to read and write to my windows drive but wont do it to another hdd i have that is ntfs y?? i really want it so both os can see it, can some one help oh ( the linux and windows is on the same physical harddrive)
00:39	<pazsion>	how do i tell ubuntu live cd not to look for a connection? so i can install to HD
00:39	<soundray>	pradeep: you're not listening properly.
00:39	<ARJones>	soundray: That is incorrect. I am running the 200M right now with compiz and 0 problems. You just have to follow the documentation
00:40	<vigrid>	i am running ubuntu 7.04 server. i would like to set it up to accept vpn "dial in" connections from windows clients. could someone point me at a good tutorial please?
00:40	<nickrud>	Dan2552: you need to install xserver-xgl as well, log out, log in and then alt-f2 compiz --replace && emerald --replace . ATI doesn't support compiz without finagleing
00:40	<Jimb_>	Ati always has probs with composite...need to wait for better drivers
00:40	<Dan2552>	doesn't work? It's a x1600 ;(
=== slimjimflim is now known as slimjimAFK
00:40	<Charlotte>	hi all
00:40	<soundray>	ARJones: is there a trick? What documentation are you referring to?
00:40	<Anubis>	hello people... has anyone had any success with the video out Fn button?
00:40	<MTughan>	Dan2552: Newer cards may not be fully supported. My Radeon 9600 seems to work fine.
00:40	<amidaniel>	Anyone familiar with winetools? I'm having difficulty installing the MFC framework through it, as the URL it's using is outdated. Was hoping someone might point me toward a way to fix it
00:40	<pazsion>	murkyMURK PM me if you have an answer
00:40	<Anubis>	using an external display as well as your lcd
00:40	<Dan2552>	i'll have a look at documentation.... X1600 worked with old XGL
00:40	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: I can only think that using the alternative CD might get you there...never done it without a network though
00:40	<sisseck>	bmk789: yes activated the main, restricted and universe before but right now all im using is the universe
00:41	<ARJones>	Dan2552: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusionATI?highlight=%28compiz%29
00:41	<nickrud>	soundray: I've run compiz on my express 200m, but disabled it because vmware doesn't play well
00:41	<pazsion>	hmm
00:41	<RonLut>	Hi everyone I need some help... I don't have compiz working at all I think, i don't have the settings of it or something else. i can only choose Extra on visual effects... what should i do?
00:41	<bmk789>	sisseck: you disabled main?
00:41	<Vista|G33Z3R>	southafrikanse:  you there?
00:41	<vigrid>	i am running ubuntu 7.04 server. i would like to set it up to accept vpn "dial in" connections from windows clients. could someone point me at a good tutorial please?
00:41	<axjv>	capiira: I have another question: Do you know of any programs that can change bits of an html file on the fly?
00:41	<pazsion>	thank you murky
00:41	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, yes
00:41	<dinian>	Where can I read about power management / suspend / hibernate and possible ways to enable them on a laptop?
00:41	<Vista|G33Z3R>	ok i pm you you havent answered
00:41	<mrj>	vigrid, there's enough spam in here, your spam doesn't help
00:41	<Dan2552>	you're going to get so many people asking  about desktop effects here :p
00:41	<stray77>	RonLut, read this page ->	http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/category/compizberyl/
00:41	<capiira>	axjv how so ?
00:41	<Charlotte>	guys do u know how i can turn off copuz in gutsy, or how to makequick lunch button on my taskbar for turning on and off???
00:41	<sisseck>	bmk789: yeah probably not a good idea. i'll just try and enable it
00:41	<mikeo2>	is there a way to dl packages with dependencies from windows?
00:41	<ARJones>	Dan2552: Just follow it down to the "Install Compiz Fusion". After that is finished all you literally have to do is reboot and then use the appearance settings to enable it. It works flawlessly on my ATI 200M
00:41	<soundray>	nickrud: I'll have another go then. Thanks for the link, ARJones
00:42	<bmk789>	sisseck: ya enable it and reload then try it
00:42	<Dan2552>	ok I will ARJones - thanks
00:42	<capiira>	axjv don't know what you exactly mean
00:42	<mrj>	Charlotte, under appearance you can set desktop effects to none, some, extra
00:42	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, I don't have here anything here blinking
00:42	<ARJones>	yep
00:42	<nickrud>	soundray: if you look back to my post to Dan2552 , that's all you have to do
00:42	<vigrid>	mrj: your comments about spamming don't help neither ;) do you happen to know an answer to my question?
00:42	<mikeo2>	like say i have an ubuntu box that isn't and cant be plugged into the internet... is there a way to dl packages and all deps from a win box then transfer them to the linux box and install with dpkg
00:42	<axjv>	capiira: Say there's a line of code in my html file saying something like: <PARAM name="name" value="x">
00:42	<RonLut>	stray77 I already read it... but when I type that command it doesn't adds the settings....
00:42	<mrj>	vigrid, no, but in the 3 spams you sent i'm sure you could have googled OpenVPN, etc
00:42	<kas1>	Please help.  I'm still waiting to see if anyone knows what I can do to install ubuntu on this old HP computer running windows ME.  instead of loading, the cd takes me to (initramfs)
00:42	<axjv>	capiira: I want to be able to change that x on the fly
00:42	<monk>	Does anybody here emulate maplestory, gunzonline using ubuntu?
00:42	<PAStheLoD>	hi. If I've crashed GParted while it was creating a partition, what are my chances of being in deep shit?
00:42	<axjv>	capiira: Like, have a program saying: What do you want the title to be?
00:42	<tag>	wow I can't seem to update
00:43	<pazsion>	so does anyone know any commands for advanced options during bootup? i want to disable gnome connections
00:43	<MTughan>	PAStheLoD: Probably high.
00:43	<mrj>	tag, the servers are backed up
00:43	<soundray>	nickrud: will try in a quiet minute. Thanks!
00:43	<Flats>	Ok I need help with this I have the Inter pro/wireless 2945ABG adapter. I found the intel linux driver which I downloaded but I have to install a ieee thingy first. I do that but then it says I have to "install it into my •kernel• and and build it as part of my •kernel• image" is that something a noob should even attempt?
00:43	<Charlotte>	great thanx
00:43	<vigrid>	mrj: thanks, that's helpful. i can google openvpn, now that i know something like this exists
00:43	<Charlotte>	:)
00:43	<tag>	mrj: I see that :-)
00:43	<pradeep>	soundray, yes i understand the applications
00:43	<ARJones>	tag, use the easynews mirrors. they worked great for me
00:43	<capiira>	axjv don't know anything sorry thats some kind of content management search for that
00:43	<needhelpplz>	ok guys i just finished installing gusty and couldnt help but notice that i cant preview mp3s anymore? anyone have a solution?
00:43	<barnaby>	gparted is very forgiving. if you didn't apply your changes you should be ok.
00:43	<soundray>	pazsion: people don't seem to understand what you mean by connections.
00:43	<Vista|G33Z3R>	southafrikanse:  open grub>menu.lst >	scroll to bottom where it says title windows nt/xp blah blah copy all that info paste that at the top of the menu  before the debian loaders then delete the  windows entry right at bottom
00:43	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: in my exerience, not much. It has crashed on me dozens of times...always at the finish of a job for some readon...
00:43	<PAStheLoD>	MTughan, thanks .. fdisk doesn't see the partition table .. but I'm using files from that drive .. can I dump the one from the memory somehow?
00:43	<stray77>	Ronlut, the repos are overwhelmed right now, try later maybe but sudo aptitude install compizconfig-settings-manager definately worked earlier today.
00:43	<bmk789>	needhelpplz: look in the nautilus prefrences
00:44	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, and did it do the job?
00:44	<mrj>	vigrid, thats the most softare vpn solution i know of
00:44	<sisseck>	bmk789: when updating it freezes but im gonna try and play around with it a bit tommorow. Thanks for the help
00:44	<bmk789>	sisseck: np
00:44	<pazsion>	everyone: gnome tryis to look for a network, there is none.. ghow do i tell it to stop and not to try...
00:44	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, ok
00:44	<bmk789>	hamachi is good for VPN
00:44	<Abraxas_>	ko, uninstalled xgl..gonna restart X and give it a go....brb
00:44	<vigrid>	mrj: thanks again, bye
00:44	<kjp>	is it possible to upgrade to 7.10 from 7.04 without a cd ?
00:44	<tag>	ARJones: that is better.  They're still pretty swampped it seems.
00:44	<PAStheLoD>	pazsion, disable the "enalbe this connection" in network manager
00:44	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: yes, everytime. The first few times My heart stopped...now I just wince a bit....
00:44	<RootyRootRootWoo>	HI, where can I d/l the Alternative DVD for upgrading from please?
00:44	<mrj>	kjp, yes but i wouldnt try it right now

00:44	<marx2k_>	!pastebin
00:44	<needhelpplz>	bmk789: i have it set to always
00:45	<ubotwo>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)

00:45	<stray77>	kjp, what mrj said
00:45	<ubotwo>	Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
00:45	<needhelpplz>	and still no sound, this wasnt an issue in edgy or feisty for me =\
00:45	<kjp>	mrj: granted, but whats the procedure? dist-upgrade doesn't seem to trigger it.
00:45	<demon_spork>	Gparted on the Gutsy LiveCD just sits there working and never gets done when I try to open it
00:45	<pazsion>	PASTHELOD__can i do this from advanced optiones during bootup it's hangin right now..
00:45	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, ah.. that either can be great or very unfortunate for me .. I've been messing aroung on my RAID0 array :C
00:45	<Abraxas_>	that -was- the problem...removed Xgl and everything is gorgeous
00:45	<soundray>	pazsion: listen to PAStheLoD. To do it permanently, disable nm-applet in System-Preferences-Session-Startup programs
00:45	<|Flood|>	----------- i installed 7.04 in a VPC 2007 VM btw and never got the internet to work... any suggestions?
00:45	<capiira>	axjv im off ciao
00:45	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, going to check it out. Be right back
00:45	<PAStheLoD>	pazsion, no, I don't think so ..
00:45	<mrj>	kjp, not sure honestly i reinstall with every release
00:45	<bmk789>	needhelpplz: its not muted or anything like that is it?   sound works?
00:45	<Abraxas_>	i'll wait on versions of xgl to get more stable and try it again someday ;p
00:45	<axjv>	capiira: See ya
00:45	<mrj>	kjp, dist-update or something perhaps
00:45	<needhelpplz>	bmk789: yes
00:45	<needhelpplz>	sure does
00:45	<RonLut>	stray77, Sorry but what you mean by saying "repos are overwhelmed right now"?

00:46	<jarrod_>	is it possible to convert my lcd signal cable from a salvaged laptop to vga?
00:46	<bmk789>	needhelpplz: mp3 codecs installed?
00:46	<marx2k_>	Does this make sense to anyone?
00:46	<marx2k_>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41141/
00:46	<kjp>	mrj:  do you know how I might clone my 20gb disk, with ubuntu installed onto a 160, such that I can simply switch them out ?
00:46	<needhelpplz>	bmk789: i let totem download and install them for me
00:46	<pazsion>	soundtray it's on another system next to this one soo.. i can work indipendantly and keep this chat going
00:46	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: when it crashes, I restart the ap and check. The job it was spose to do is always done. Hope you have the same experience....
00:46	<soundray>	pazsion: no, sorry, wrong track, go ahead and reboot
00:46	<needhelpplz>	after that didnt work i installed mpg321 and still no go
00:46	<sebastes>	hrm, I can't get ccsm to start it gives me this error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41142/
00:46	<Flats>	ne1 know if openvpn will read/use cisco pcf files?
00:46	<mikeo2>	are there any programs for windows or an online web script that can be used to find all package dependencies and download them to a folder?
00:46	<needhelpplz>	should i remove totems gstreamer codec and reinstall mpg321?
00:46	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise,  yeah I have .. my Partiton table has gone .. :C
00:47	<kjp>	Flats: well, they work on completly different principles do I doubt it
00:47	<stray77>	bmk789, i just tried to play and xvid file in totem and it prompted me to install codecs
00:47	<Flats>	ahh OK
00:47	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: is that what you wanted to happen?
00:47	<RonLut>	ah ok thanks...  i'm new to linux so i'll try later or something...
00:47	<tag>	I don't get that "Upgrade available" button
00:47	<Shaezsche>	i cannot check for updates, the repositories dont update
00:47	<Jupp2>	should I remove beryl from my 7.04 before I update?
00:47	<soundray>	mikeo2: not really, but there are instructions for using apt offline. I'll dig them out...
00:47	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, no I wanted to create a 10 GB reiser4 partition .. but this was an over 1 tera array :/
00:47	<monkeyBox>	If I upgrade to 7.10,  and I already have compiz-fusion installed,  will it break anything?
00:48	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: hey, I've tried again, a startx from console (without gdm) shows me the old monochrome X11 background instead of the sandy one
00:48	<tag>	weird, get it on one box but not the other
00:48	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: any suggestion will be greatly appreciated:)
00:48	<PAStheLoD>	monkeyBox, hopefully not
00:48	<mikeo2>	soundray i have used apt offline but need a way to dl packages and their deps from a windows box
00:48	<mikeo2>	without manually clicking on each one
00:48	<cousin_luigi>	PAStheLoD: is reiser4 production grade?
00:48	<Dan2552>	There was an error starting the GNOME Settings Daemon. Some things, such as themes, sounds, or background settings may not work correctly. The last error message was: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-GxEAKiRVj3: Connection refused. GNOME will still try to restart the Settings Daemon next time you log in.
00:48	<mrj>	I think the icons chosen for the compiz manager are horribly undescriptive
00:48	<soundray>	mikeo2: so you've got a list of packages to download already?
00:48	<PAStheLoD>	cousin_luigi, it says "released" on namesys.com
00:48	<Vista|G33Z3R>	so how do i get root to be able to edit grub  su -s?
00:49	<nickrud>	cousin_luigi: not sure, really. I was under the impression that gdm handled that, then handed off to nautilus. In between??
00:49	<PAStheLoD>	cousin_luigi, so I thought so..
00:49	<mikeo2>	i could make a list from the linux box
00:49	<dopel>	grub failed on the install...is there a way to reinstall just grub?
00:49	<bmk789>	Dan2552: i had that problem after i upgraded, try a reboot
00:49	<mrj>	Vista|G33Z3R, gksudo gedit
00:49	<Dan2552>	i just rebooted though, i reboot again?
00:49	<joerlend>	I've installed from the server cd. Now, I want to add some software from the desktop cd. How do I add that to sources.list?
00:49	<mrj>	Vista|G33Z3R, /etc/boot/menus.lst
00:49	<Abraxas_>	now to get cedega working
00:49	<southafrikanse>	Vista|G33Z3R, actually it did work but now I don't have Windows mounted :\
00:49	<soundray>	mikeo2: just have a look at these instructions: http://www.batmat.net/apt-offline/
00:49	<Draggin>	Could someone perhaps just give me a link on the web for something similar?  I don't mind sorting it out on my own
00:49	<monkeyBox>	IS there any way I can see what packages have been installed from a specific repository?
00:49	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: yes, apparently...and it's the same as the stock ubuntu single tint background
00:49	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	Hi, everyone, I'm in hell here after upgrading to Gutsy. Can someone please help me enabling my NVidia card and OpenGL?
00:49	<mikeo2>	soundray trying to dl all the packages from a win box to a folder, then copy them to the linux box and dpkg -i *.deb them
00:49	<needhelpplz>	how do u remove the codecs that totem installs?
00:50	<to0om>	hi all, does anyone know why vmware-player isn't in the gutsy repositories?
00:50	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: oh my.. I was messing with reiser4 today. seems I don't have the right kernel for seeing the partition, but gparted can make one. I got tired of mesing with it and went to ext3-still journaled, just not quite as fast ...
00:50	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: should just be System->Administration->Restricted Drivers Manager
00:50	<bmk789>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: restricted manager?
00:50	<Shaezsche>	how can i change the default boot os?
00:50	<kitche>	to0om: it might be in commerical
00:50	<x_dimitri>	hi all
00:50	<joerlend>	Shaezsche: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst
00:50	<diafic>	snore time. Night
00:50	<mrj>	Shaezsche, edit your menu.lst
00:50	<bmk789>	Shaezsche: you can modify your menu.list or get startup-manager
00:50]  * Pelo wonders how everyone likes the new release 
00:50	<soundray>	mikeo2: so you need something like wget for windows?
00:50	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan and bmk789: I do that, reboot and Ubuntu starts in low graphics mode
00:50	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	:(
00:51	<to0om>	kitche: is that the repository where opera also is in? then it's not; i have that repository enabled
00:51	<cousin_luigi>	Pelo: I like it until now, codecs and plugins are easily installed
00:51	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: what card exactly?
00:51	<x_dimitri>	I've got a problem, synaptic doesn't seem to use the authentication information I specify
00:51	<marx2k_>	See if this makes sense to any of you: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41141/
00:51	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, ah.. I did this Wubi install ... then installed dmraid .. I've even built a new parted .. then tried to make a partition to move the wubi install to
00:51	<Shaezsche>	bmk789 i tried editing grub menu.lst, when i changed "default 0" to 5 and 6 nothing happened
00:51	<x_dimitri>	does anyone know how to solve this?
00:51	<ademan>	anyone know if your swap partition can be a lvm logical partition?
00:51	<mikeo2>	i need something like apt for windows
00:51	<mikeo2>	but for linux apps
00:51	<dopel>	grub failed on the install...is there a way to reinstall just grub without redoing the entire install?
00:51	<mrj>	x_dimitri, what do you mean authentication info? your root password?
00:51	<x_dimitri>	ademan:yes, it can
00:51	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	BTW, I have to boot with kernel 2.6.20.16 if I do with 2.6.22.14 I get tons of errors
00:51	<ademan>	mikeo2: i think cygwin might be what you're looking for
00:51	<x_dimitri>	mrj:nope, network proxy
00:51	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan: NVidia 6200
00:51	<soundray>	mikeo2: no, you need to read the link I gave you
00:51	<mikeo2>	i read it
00:51	<ademan>	thanks x_dimitri
00:52	<x_dimitri>	ademan:sure
00:52	<soundray>	ademan: cygwin won't resolve the dependencies for mikeo2
00:52	<mikeo2>	its if you have 2 linux boxes
00:52	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: interesting i've got a 6600 here and everythings working fine
00:52	<|Flood|>	lol i see a vista like background on the desktop but it's... brown/orange
00:52	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox,  .14 is old .. even 7.04 had .15
00:52	<mikeo2>	i have 1 win on the internet and 1 linux not connected
00:52	<Flats>	Isn't there an open source vpn client that reads/uses pcf files?
00:52	<mikeo2>	need to dl the packages from the win box
00:52	<ademan>	soundray: ah, sorry, i wouldn't know, i don't touch windows anymore :-)

00:52	<soundray>	mikeo2: no, it doesn't matter what runs on the box that's on the internet

00:52]  * x_dimitri longs for the day he won't have to touch windows anymore
00:52	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	PAStheLoD: 2.6.22.14 is the newest I see here
00:52	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, yeah .. that's the case I'm afraid ..
00:52	<Shaezsche>	what do i edit in menu.lst to change defaul tboot os?
00:52	<demon_spork>	Whenever GParted or the installer partitioner get to the "Scanning disks" stage they freeze
00:53	<javaJake>	Hello folks. I'm having issues with xorg.conf and evdev. Here's my pastebin: http://pastebin.ca/741799 and the tutorial I followed: http://andy.hillhome.org/blog/2006/09/27/logitech-mx-revolution-in-linux/ - I don't think I'm using evdev correctly, as my keyboard is going crazy. (Up key acts like Print Screen button, and so on.)
00:53	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox,  where do you see that?
00:53	<|Flood|>	x_dimitri careful what you wish for man
00:53	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan: any thoughts?
00:53	<mikeo2>	pretty much apt-get -d <huge package list>
00:53	<x_dimitri>	does anyone know how to force synaptic to use the specified proxy authentication details?
00:53	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	PAStheLoD: on GRUB
00:53	<Dan2552>	thanks for the help guys, desktop effects now working :)!
00:53	<mikeo2>	want to do that in windows then copy the files to linux
00:53	<alexMK>	HI, is it possible to upgrade from ubuntu7.10beta to 7.10 release?
00:53	<soundray>	mikeo2: all you need on that one is some download manager that processes a list of files. Which is where ademan's advice might come in handy.
00:53	<boubbin>	!ccsm
00:53	<ubotwo>	To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
00:53	<soundray>	alexMK: read the topic
00:53	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, Wubi is very great, but it has issues with Fucked-Fake-RAIDs .. like mine on my nForce 5 .. :C
00:53	<mikeo2>	soundray ok ill look for that then
00:53	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, but do you see something like Ubuntu Original ?
00:54	<demon_spork>	what happened to ubotu?
00:54	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: unfortunately not really, you might try looking at /var/log/Xorg.0.log

00:54	<flick2>	hi, i need support, i am midway through the installation
00:54	<brandon>	can you install from ubuntu iso and then apt-get kubuntu and end up with the same exact system as if you had installed from the kubuntu iso????
00:54	<PAStheLoD>	/boot/grub/menu.lst maybe ..
00:54	<demon_spork>	!ask | flick2
00:54	<ubotwo>	flick2: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
00:54	<cousin_luigi>	flick2: what appears to be the problem?
00:54	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: onlt raids I ever had good luck with is dedicated external arrays or Windows builtin raid. typically raid 5.
00:55	<flick2>	the installation stopped at 82%, saying "Configuring apt" and Scanning the mirror...
00:55	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox,  /boot/grub/menu.lst .. maybe .. or /boot/menu.lst ..
00:55	<soundray>	brandon: almost. You have to install kubuntu-desktop and all its dependencies.
00:55	<WorkingOnWise>	onlt=only
00:55	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan: What information I should look in there?
00:55	<cousin_luigi>	flick2: your network is possibly slow
00:55	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	PAStheLoD: kk, hold on
00:55	<flick2>	the installation hasn't proceeded for 15 minutes
00:55	<kst>	I tried to select a different gfx driver in that new gutsy gui (using ati with proprietary fglrx so far, wanted to go for the open source version of radeon), rebooted and now my notebook display only runs in 640x480 anymore and I cant seem to get my gfx card back to normal work... what do I do? :(
00:55	<|Flood|>	flick2 it's on break
00:55	<x_dimitri>	Is there supposed to be a /etc/apt/apt.conf file? My searches suggest that file exists but I can't find it.
00:55	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, oh.. builtin RAID 5 .. sofware raid5  oh.. :0 that's like massive CPU overhead and duplicated IO channels :|
00:55	<cousin_luigi>	flick2: I would jump to a console and give an ifconfig eth0 down
00:56	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: lines beginning with EE:  are errors, that'd be a good place to stary
00:56	<nickrud>	flick2: try clt-alt-f8, you should be able to see a log of the install, maybe there's a clue there
00:56	<soundray>	flick2: your burn might have failed. Reboot and use the boot option for checking the CD.
00:56	<brandon>	tougher question:  can you do a dist-upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10, putting i386 version over the amd64 version?
00:56	<ademan>	start*
00:56	<soundray>	brandon: no, to change architecture, you have to reinstall.
00:56	<brandon>	soundray: ouch
00:56	<nickrud>	flick2: but do cousin_luigi 's before you give up and start over
00:56	<brandon>	thanks and later on
00:56	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	PAStheLoD and ademan Should I use pastebin to show you guys the lines?
00:56	<soundray>	brandon: all the binaries are different, and the kernel too
00:56	<flick2>	nickrud:  no clue at ctrl+alt+f8
00:56	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: sure
00:56	<kst>	can I use an ubuntu 7.04 live cd to mount my 7.10 .iso from some other harddrive, and then install gutsy from it?
00:57	<jazz>	hi
00:57	<nickrud>	flick2: was there any text at all?
00:57	<erat123>	would someone be interested in helping me configure dual head on ubuntu 7.10?  i have a GeForce 6500GT DDR2 512MB PCIe card
00:57	<ademan>	finally, how big do you guys think /boot should be? i really don't wanna run out of room here...
00:57	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: yeah, but when I had 2 drives fail in as many minutes, I was glad to have the overhead... Took about 2 hours to rebuilt 45GB of data...
00:57	<javaJake>	erat123, Gutsy has better dual-head configuration - check it out
00:57	<flick2>	nickrud: it just says "* Running boot scripts..."
00:57	<bmk789>	erat123: you tried the new GUI tool?
00:57	<brandon>	soundray: I guess i should save my home directory and some configs from /etc and then wipe away -- is that how you'd do it???
00:57	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, that's blazingly fast considering windows .. what kind of setup was that? :o
00:57	<soundray>	kst: possibly. You need a way to "seed" your hard disk. See the factoid (private message)
00:57	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: and the system was only down for 30 minutes...
00:57	<nickrud>	ademan: very few reasons to have a separate boot partition with grub

01:01	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	!tell
01:01	<ubotwo>	Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
01:02	<kst>	soundray I tried to select the ATI opensource driver for my x700, was running proprietary before... after a reboot everything is broken, my screen is only 640x480 now and crap performance
01:02	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: I could get the company to spend 7000 on the server, but not 700 on a dlt and tapes...go figure
01:02	<witless>	cafuego: don't have to change sources.list or anything?
01:02	<kst>	cant set resolution higher either
01:02	<nbjayme>	now for no apparent reason it switched both cards and identified it as eth0 and eth1.
01:02	<cafuego>	witless: Well yes, that would be helpful.
01:02	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, yeah, that's the usual CFO BS :|
01:02	<PurpZeY>	Have most people's upgrades been smooth? or are there a lot of problems?
01:02	<gravemind>	hey
01:02	<WorkingOnWise>	lol....yeah, they sur is smart !
=== TheCrowX_ is now known as TheCrowX
01:03	<leexgx>	i trying to get my windows computer to acces my ubuntu but keeps asking for password
01:03	<nbjayme>	so, i think that allowing users to tell ubuntu which card should be treated as eth0 and eth1 is a better way.
01:03	<IpMooBeta>	PurpZeY:   flawless here
01:03	<soundray>	kst: I would try restoring xorg.conf from one of the backups in /etc/X11 -- then change fglrx to ati by hand
01:03	<Cryoniq>	Lovely.. did a clean install of Gutsy and now things seem to work A LOT better with my ATI card
01:03	<iStiKs>	can anyone help me
01:03	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, hm.. should I risk a reboot with a half-dead partition table .. or is there some way to dump the one from the memory (I'm assuming the kernel has one :))
01:03	<ipx>	Sorry, I meant this one: http://pastebin.com/m51a09365
01:03	<Nuked>	Cryoniq:  you are not the only one
01:03	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan: http://pastebin.ca/741813
01:03	<Cryoniq>	Upgrade from feisty... I cannot advice that.. yet..
01:03	<gravemind>	hey guys, Is it possible to do an upgrade from a live cd?
01:03	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: you using grub, right?
01:03	<flithm>	hey everyone... just going through a fresh gutsy install here.  The fonts are FREAKIN MASSIVE.  Like 100+ pt.  It's crazy.  Anyone else had this?
01:03	<PurpZeY>	Cryoniq: Magic words...clean...
01:03	<IpMooBeta>	grayscale:   u have todo a install
01:03	<kst>	ok soundray... seems this new gui thing is not exactly working well? :)
01:04	<hb>	how do I install grub onto a fakeraid array?  I'm using the gutsy alternate install cd to setp and configure it but grub gives me a fatal error when it's time to install the bootloader.  any ideas?
01:04	<iStiKs>	Cryoniq: how bout the compiz fusion since its currently installed already in feisty
01:04	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	yeh, have there been lots of probles with the gusty upgrade? would i be better of installing gusty from scratch?
01:04	<KeKoS>	hi, I have a problem with the new gutsy, the sound is very low. what may happen?
01:04	<|box|>	you cant login to desktop as root :(
01:04	<soundray>	kst: I haven't had much opportunity yet to gather my own experience
01:04	<brandon>	is there supposed to be an "install/remove programs" application in gutsy?
01:04	<IpMooBeta>	brandon:  yes
01:04	<hb>	s/setp/set-up
01:04	<codecaine>	can somebody help me get a wep key from console on new ubuntu?
01:04	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, sure.. my Windows is on a separate drive .. wingrub is on it .. and that loads the real grub through an loopmounted virtual partition ..
01:04	<tritium>	|box|: use sudo -i
01:04	<thunter>	why does apt try to connect to archive.ubuntu.com when i don't have it listed in my sources.list?
01:04	<cousin_luigi>	brandon: synaptic
01:04	<mattb0611>	so I upgraded during the beta phase, no problems. is a clean install still recommended?
01:04	<dgr>	hi guys, if i wanted to send a file to someone in xchat using dcc/filesend, to a person using windows/mirc in a automatic way, how can i do that? by automatic i mean without me having to send it, like with mirc/omenserve, they type a command and i autosend a particular file... is it possible/easy?
01:04	<Nuked>	Cryoniq: depending on the card you might need to install xserver-xgl
=== sivik_ is now known as Sivik
01:04	<codecaine>	I tried sudo iwconfig ath0 key mykey
01:04	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: here's your culprit "(EE) Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found)" now we just need to know why
01:05	<Flyzoola>	hey guys, is there a channel for help?
01:05	<Cryoniq>	Anyhow.. on to my question :P When I now try to use advanced preferences.. that is.. compiz fuzion.. with my ati9800 card with restricted fglrx drivers.. it says.. no composite extension available.. what to do?
01:05	<tritium>	Flyzoola: this is it
01:05	<kst>	mm ok
01:05	<Flyzoola>	ok sweet
01:05	<Flyzoola>	well, I'm having troubles
01:05	<brandon>	not synaptic
01:05	<Flyzoola>	and getting frustrated haha
01:05	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan: kk, how do I proceed? I've downloaded a driver from NVidia's site btw...
01:05	<LjL>	ubotwo: part
01:05	<colby1>	Ok Finally Got Gutsy up and running.. man is it beautiful..
01:05	<soundray>	Flyzoola: keep it on one line, please
01:05	<foug>	I am using Debian Etch currently, I plan on installing Ubuntu 7.10. During installation, to I have the option to important files/folders over?
01:06	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: you don't need to do that, install nvidia-glx-new
01:06	<Cryoniq>	What to do when gutsy attacks with a banana? :)
01:06	<flick>	cousin_luigi: i have rebooted, it's working fine except when i try to add XChat it says "The list of applications is not available"
01:06	<nrp>	After upgrading to feisty, I can no longer get into gnome.  it cycles back into console and back into gdm after i log in, and it gives an error that i'm missing libresmgr.so.0.9.8
01:06	<hb>	no fakeraid support eh? :(
01:06	<danlock2>	okay, so i can't apt-get anything.
01:06	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: do what cousin_luigi said, i think that's a better bet
01:06	<boubbin>	so AIGLX is enabled if im on gutsy ?
01:06	<foug>	danlock2: are you root?
01:06	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	kk, hold on
01:06	<PAStheLoD>	hb, well, dmraid works fine
01:06	<cousin_luigi>	flick: system/admin/software sources
01:06	<ademan>	danlock2: i think the repositories are under incredible stress right now
01:06	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: not sure then...real grub is usually installed on the drive, but not a partition. Windows bootloader is installed on the partition. is your bootable partition still there, and it the win partition in the same numerical location?
01:06	<cousin_luigi>	flick: then do a reload
01:06	<nrp>	err, i mean, upgrading from feisty
01:06	<flick>	ok
01:06	<danlock2>	ademan: i think so as well, they time out a lot.
01:06	<kitche>	boubbin: it was enabled in feisty also
01:06	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	yeah the repos are like about to explode
01:06	<dave>	question, are the gutsy upgrade repo's real bogged down or is my computer being a @#$%@#$
01:06	<Think_Differentl>	Weee. repos are terribly slow. can't even download the package info :/
01:06	<foug>	I am using Debian Etch currently, I plan on installing Ubuntu 7.10. During installation, to I have the option to important files/folders over?
01:06	<newbie1>	anyone know why IBM T61 Laptop sound breaks on upgrade? I was wondering if theres a program i can run to reconfigure my alsa sound?
01:06	<kitche>	Think_Differentl: read the topic :)
01:07	<hb>	PASthelod: Yes it does, but I can boot my system without a boot loader :/
01:07	<Think_Differentl>	yerr. i did :P
01:07	<dave>	answers my question
01:07	<|box|>	got me gutsy gibbon from demonoid ran live cd so i could brose the net listen to radio while  i installed im impressed
01:07	<boubbin>	kitche so running compizfusio should be easy on gutsy ?+
01:07	<soundray>	!tell newbie1 about intelhda
01:07	<kitche>	boubbin: if you have the right card yes
01:07	<soundray>	newbie1: please read the private message from ubotwo
01:07	<haru>	where are the lock files for firefox?
01:07	<flick>	cousin_luigi: Software Sources doesn't have a reload button, has a Revert button which is disabled
01:07	<Flyzoola>	ok. So I've been trying to get software to broadcast to an internet radio. I installed gnump3d amongst many other apps, but nothing has worked. I installed GNUMP3d from Synaptic, but I don't know how to run it. Shouldn't there be like... a launcher icon or something for it? This is all so confusing
01:07	<dave>	2nd question, got a router that keeps dropping my cable connection, anyone think it might work better as a switch with dhcpd installed on one of the computers?
01:07	<newbie1>	K
01:07	<kitche>	soundray: ubotwo is gone
01:07	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu.
01:07	<danlock2>	cuz i was like UGH! i can't update, and was hoping that it was just the repos dying a bit.
01:07	<Intrepd>	ls
01:07	<cousin_luigi>	flick: sorry I meant after you selected them
01:08	<Cryoniq>	Does the compisite extension is not available mean that fglrx and ati9800pro isn't working for compiz?
01:08	<brandon>	there was supposedly a simpler install/remove programs application here somewhere, but i don't have it. i don't mean synaptic
01:08	<cousin_luigi>	flick: just do a sudo apt-get update from console then
01:08	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, on my RAID array I HAVE (have faith.. have faith.. :)) just 2 NTFS partitions .. and neither of them are bootable .. etc .. an on one of them there is the virtual partition (just an NTFS file) .. and grub is in a separate file
01:08	<soundray>	kitche: can't keep up... thanks
01:08	<Nuked>	the repos still arent working... wow... must be a lot of people upgrading today
01:08	<hb>	does grub have to install on a IDE source even if SATA is selected as the primary boot source in the bios?

01:08	<kitche>	Nuked: yes like it usually is that why some of us wait a few weeks :)
01:08	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan and cousin_luigi: did it, should I reboot, restart X, what?
01:08	<PAStheLoD>	hb, you can build a kernel for yourself with dmraid and device-mapper support
01:08	<foug>	I am using Debian Etch currently, I plan on installing Ubuntu 7.10. During installation, to I have the option to important files/folders over?

01:08	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu.
01:08	<Nuked>	kitche: its also why some of us upgrade a few weeks early
01:09	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: installed nvidia-glx-new, what's next?
01:09	<danlock2>	foug: create a new partiton to store thos?e files on for the time being

01:09	<danlock2>	?
01:09	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: might as well reboot since it would hopefully load the new driver module
01:09	<soundray>	Blama: not really. Have you tried a plug cycle?
01:09	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: so your win system partition is hdb or sda?
01:09	<Flyzoola>	is there anybody that I can PM about my problem, perhaps?
01:09	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: you have to activate it from the restricted drivers manager
01:09	<flick>	cousin_luigi: right thanks... i think sudo apt-get update did the trick, stopped at 50% though, probably the server is under stress
01:09	<foug>	danlock2: so there is no way to import them during installation?
01:09	<WorkingOnWise>	sdb i meant
01:09	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	compiz should run by default in gusty, unless you heve terribe video acceleration
01:09	<danlock2>	foug: i'm not sure.
01:10	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: hdb or sdb
01:10	<soundray>	Flyzoola: please have a bit of patience, and repost your error description if you don't get a response at first.
01:10	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, hda ..
01:10	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: I only see one driver there, and I already activated it earlier
01:10	<WorkingOnWise>	and where it the fubar partition table?
01:10	<flick>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: how do i confirm if compiz is running?
01:10	<r0b->	the mirrors are still slow lol
01:10	<codecaine>	I can't get my laptop on the network on a static ip I did nmap -sP to see if its on the router and I see it on there
01:10	<codecaine>	any sugesstions
01:10	<hb>	PASthelod: I'm not using nvraid i's via and i'd prefer to use the ubuntu system.  I have several nodes I need to configure and I'd like the process to be as automated as possible (install cd).  I have the feeling that the alternate cd will do it, but that i'm doing something wrong.  I just dont know what
01:10	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	ummm... i dont really know lol
01:10	<cousin_luigi>	flick: it would be wise to do a mirror scan now, to find out the faster one
01:10	<|Flood|>	50% :)
01:10	<Cryoniq>	Anyone know anything about this --->	The Composite extension is not available
01:10	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, hda2 actually .. totally separate drive .. and I've a little 50 megs FAT partition on hda1 just for these purposes ..
01:10	<|Flood|>	50% :) in the VM :)
01:10	<Flyzoola>	ok. So I've been trying to get software to broadcast to an internet radio. I installed gnump3d amongst many other apps, but nothing has worked. I installed GNUMP3d from Synaptic, but I don't know how to run it. Shouldn't there be like... a launcher icon or something for it? This is all so confusing

01:11	<JMilton>	hi. i tried apt-get installing some packages i already have, and they were set as manually installed. they were dependencies of a metapackage, and i want them to stay that way - how do i flag them as being automatically installed again?
01:11	<x_dimitri>	what's the alternative to chasing down dependencies (which in turn have dependencies) when trying to install a package?
01:11	<flick>	cousin_luigi: thanks
01:11	<soundray>	Blama: ah, that's usually flaky hardware or a dissonance between the device and the hub. Can you plug it into another socket?
01:11	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, I don't understand your problem completely. I've just replied to one of your messages but I haven't got the first part .. so if you tell me I can try :)
01:11	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: either a reboot or a X11 restart with ctrl alt backspace
01:12	<kitche>	the_darkside_986: then you shouldn't trust linux to burn stuff either

01:13	<ademan>	danlock2: hope not, but i suppose that might be it
01:13	<hb>	PASthelod: there has to be something obvious in the install process i'm missing.  guess I'll find it on my own
01:13	<caner>	<danlock2>	bogged? what does that mean? are you also having problems?
01:13	<Blama>	soundray, I have tried all the USB ports on my computer but all of them gave the same error. I know it isn't a problem with the ports because my USB mouse works fine.
01:13	<ademan>	ergh, i guess i'll check the cd for errors first
01:13	<Flyzoola>	ok. So I've been trying to get software to broadcast to an internet radio. I installed gnump3d amongst many other apps, but nothing has worked. I installed GNUMP3d from Synaptic, but I don't know how to run it. Shouldn't there be like... a launcher icon or something for it?

01:13	<danlock2>	can other people at least apt-get update?
01:13	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: hda2 would be partition 2 on physical drive 1....oh I see, you are calling physical drive 1 as hda1 and drive 2 as hda2, while I am calling drive 1 as hda and drive 2 as hdb, right?
01:13	<danlock2>	mine freezes @ waiting for headers

01:14	<mikeo2>	the us.archive one
01:14	<PAStheLoD>	hb, maybe .. or maybe not .. try custom boot arguments at the bootup

01:14	<soundray>	Flyzoola: you can get a list of installed programs with 'dpkg -L gnump3d'. Look for lines with 'bin' in the path. Also have a look at the docs in /usr/share/doc/gnump3d
01:14	<|box|>	apt-get install rtorrent?
01:14	<tatortot>	is there any body who can help me with a usb grub install, I get a black screen with only the word grub

01:15	<gravemind>	soundray: thanks. beats having to do download separately for 3 computers
01:15	<stray77>	|box|, that not what i mean, instead of everyone pulling from the repos, we could all pull from each other
01:15	<crdlb>	Cryoniq, install xserver-xgl
01:15	<caner>	gnome2.2 came with an ugly default font setting. is there anybody who liked it? it looks like windows

01:15	<jpastore>	man gutsy is taking a long time to download...
01:15	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, no.. I call hda as The Drive .. hdb as The Other Drive .. and hda1 hda2 hdb1 the partitions .. and I've /dev/mapper/nvidia_facgee--something for my raid and that has nvidia_fagaga1 nvidia_fagag2 and 3 and 5 and 6 too

01:16	<Pie-rate>	Is there somewhere I can find a summary of the cool new features in gutsy?
01:16	<lImItaO>	where does evolution save its configuration files? .evolution and ...

01:17	<BrokenPipe>	Is there any way to force update-manager to upGRADE from the Gutsy CD?
01:17	<madsy_>	kitche:  what can i do?
01:17	<Pie-rate>	ooh i found it, never mind
01:17	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf|grep nv
01:17	<JMilton>	the answer to my question above was: use 'aptitude markauto'. thanks anyway.
01:17	<|box|>	stray77:  you guys been busy today or is it normally like this?
01:17	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: it sounds like it will survive a reboot...but I'd hav a repair cd handy just incase. :)
01:17	<soundray>	gravemind: you can also upgrade one, then copy the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives to the other machines.
=== burlynn_ is now known as Tortured
01:17	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: hold on
01:17	<kitche>	madsy_: debug the core to figure out hwy it crashed
01:17	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: sorry your problem is beyond my experience i'm pretty much out of ideas, you might try re-asking your question (with the log pasted) and see if anyone else has any ideas

01:18	<gravemind>	soundray: will the alt cd work for gutsy beta too?
01:18	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, I can boot into windows .. that's on HDA .. I'm concerned about the partition table of the nvidia_fgaga RAID array :|
01:18	<Name141-->	"Sorry, couldn't display all the contents of "Windows Network: livingroom"."
01:18	<soundray>	gravemind: yes, it should

01:18	<|box|>	hey i can pull files off my vista  drive and pull it on  this one thats neat
01:18	<IcemanV9>	Blama: unplug it and plug it in; wait for a few seconds ... if not, try other port
01:18	<gravemind>	soundray: awesome! Too bad the live cd can't do it though
01:18	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: can you post them?
01:19	<Charlotte>	i can just move the mouse and nothing else
01:19	<ademan>	Charlotte: liveCD or installed?
01:19	<Blama>	Icemanv9, tried
01:19	<|Flood|>	68%..... i was born in 68
01:19	<Charlotte>	installed
01:19	<MarcN>	The gnome appearance tool hangs on me
01:19	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: sure, hold on
01:19	<Cryoniq>	wish there was a way to restart xserver without applications closing down also (?)
01:19	<soundray>	Charlotte: that sounds like bad hardware -- the hard disk perhaps
01:19	<murphyg>	just installed gusty (via alt cd upgrade from fiesty.   nvidia-settings says that I need to run nvidia-xconfig and restart the x server.   I did this, but nvidia-settings still says that I'm not using the NVIDIA X driver...  any ideas?
01:19	<|Flood|>	anybody has any experience with ubuntu in a VM stay close to me plz
01:19	<Name141-->	Tech-Mike: and how do you fix it

01:19	<Tech-Mike>	Name141-- i havnt yet, dont know howto config samba right i guess
01:19	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, nv is the ubuntu driver .. nvidia is the resticted propietary nVidia driver . and you need the nvidia to use GLX / Compiz .. but I couldn't even use X.org with nvidia (only 640*480 :D)
01:19	<kitche>	murphyg: grep -i nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf and see what it says
01:19	<|box|>	msoulier:  think apt-get is either   being brusied right now or theres no install
01:20	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu and a USB mouse works fine in the same port (and all the others).

01:20	<Cryoniq>	Blama: which keyboard is it?
01:20	<msoulier>	oh, did something just release?

01:20	<|box|>	gutsy gibbon looks neat and i can pull  media files off  me vista hdd :)
01:20	<soundray>	Charlotte: I see. Perhaps run gnome-system-monitor to see whether some process jumps to the top of the list when it happens.
01:21	<w00tzilla>	Anyone able to help me with Deluge?
01:21	<Charlotte>	now i just installed gutsy a couple of hours ago and my firs impresion is  that is a little slower then FF on my system and this strange freezing :(

01:21	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: x11 config is messed up..it has two drivers enabled, I assume it loads the latter
01:21	<techjim>	Fryguy--: centrino, a friend's toshiba laptop.
01:22	<extrakick>	sup everyone
01:22	<PAStheLoD>	|box|,  lol :D:D a free sofware on a BT Tracker :]
01:22	<EruditeHermit>	hi, I was wondering whether the intel GMA x3100 has a driver capable of working with compiz?
01:22	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: and it should load the first one?
01:22	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: yes
01:22	<Fryguy-->	techjim: hrmm, not related hardware at all :)  I'd imagine it's not hardware/driver related then
01:22	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: and just that
01:22	<IcemanV9>	ademan: ubotu is taking a break from being abused ;)
01:22	<[IT]4ngelus>	soundray: i red that, but it did not solve the problem
01:22	<extrakick>	is there nyword on how to get gutsy to take a gcard off blcklist?
01:22	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: kk, let me try to remove that from xorg.conf
01:22	<PAStheLoD>	Charlotte, system->	administration ->	system monitor
01:22	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: try commenting out the second one but I've no idea how that happened
01:22	<admin_>	does anyone know how to get the 82801G audio chipset working on 7.10 ?
=== admin_ is now known as dezza
01:22	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: ok
01:22	<|box|>	PAStheLoD:  lol they just dont care i think they get the thieving feeling even if its free lol but it helps  the ubuntu server if its on torrents
01:22	<ademan>	O_o, my gutsy liveCD just dropped into text mode instead of the nifty usplash loading screen, double O_o the screen is all messed up
=== dezza is now known as dezza4
01:23	<msoulier>	hmm, 404s on the non-free repository I was using
01:23	<nrp>	EruditeHermit, it is capable, but it currently blacklisted
01:23	<witless>	does the i915 driver work with compiz?
01:23	<PovAddict>	ademan: screenshot?
01:23	<Charlotte>	thnax
01:23	<PAStheLoD>	Charlotte, or use htop or top from the terminal .. if you don't have htop then you can get it using  the command :    sudo apt-get install htop
01:23	<PovAddict>	(even if you need a digital camera to do it)
01:23	<soundray>	[IT]4ngelus: don't know then, sorry
01:23	<Charlotte>	and what i have to look for ?
01:23	<hyper_b0le>	Any suggestions for a sort of burning suite? for iso's , dvds etc etc
01:23	<sean>	Is there a mirror available for synaptic that I can use to download stuff from repositories on? The servers are so slow right now.
01:23	<ezzieyguywuf>	how can i get amarok to respond to my media keys on my keyboard (thinkpad)
01:23	<ademan>	PovAddict: no idea, but i ctrl+alt+f1 then ctrl+alt+f7 and all is well now, but then again i've been having that other issue "input/output error" or whatever
01:23	<PovAddict>	hyper_b0le: are you on ubuntu or windoze?
01:23	<[IT]4ngelus>	soundray: thanks anyway
01:24	<cousin_luigi>	w00tzilla: no idea, sorry...is that during a recheck?
01:24	<EruditeHermit>	nrp: why is that?
01:24	<PAStheLoD>	|box|,  thievinf feeling .. haaha ;]]]  ..  yeah torrents are good and were invented for that in the first place :)
01:24	<FluxD>	hyper_b0le: gnomebaker?
01:24	<nrp>	EruditeHermit, if you open /usr/bin/compiz with a text editor, find the blacklist section, and comment out the line with 965 in it, itll work
01:24	<soundray>	Charlotte: a process that jumps to the top of the list and hogs your CPU
01:24	<murphyg>	@ kitche: it says "Driver "nvidia"  VendorName "NVIDIA" BoardName "NVIDIA GeForce 8 Series" "   I have a nVidia 8600 GT
01:24	<zylstra555>	I am having an FTP issue. When I log into my FTP account (through VSFTPD) I am unable to upload/delete/modify files in any way. How do I correct this issue?
01:24	<EruditeHermit>	nrp: ok
01:24	<Kragnerac>	sudo apt-get install gutsy :)
01:24	<nrp>	EruditeHermit, I dont know the details, but something bad is broken :p
01:24	<EruditeHermit>	nrp: oh ok
01:24	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: commented out the "nv" driver and left the "nvidia" one. Now I restart X again right?
01:25	<Name141-->	I turned of the XP firewalls on the windows machine
01:25	<|box|>	PAStheLoD:  why dont they make the raposatories  so we  can use each others comps instead of a few urls?
01:25	<IanLiu>	Where is the torrent file for Gutsy?
=== w4ett_ is now known as w4ett
01:25	<Name141-->	but still the same error
01:25	<IcemanV9>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: correct
01:25	<PovAddict>	IanLiu: http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/
01:25	<Cryoniq>	Blama: The keyboard doesn't work at all in any way? Does it work when choose what to boot from grub menu (if you have a grub menu that is)?
01:25	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	IcemanV9: ok, brb
01:26	<|Flood|>	i thought this version of ubuntu came with improved graphics
01:26	<murphyg>	kitche ?
01:26	<ezzieyguywuf>	anyone know how i can get amarok to recognize the media keys on my thinkpad?
01:26	<cousin_luigi>	|Flood|: such as?
01:26	<|Flood|>	comes with an improved walpaper so far
01:26	<xtlosx>	question guys, my fiancee is using Feisty Fawn, she hasn't modified anything, and when she goes into update manager, she doesn't see a distribution upgrade... what is going on?
01:26	<Charlotte>	hmm nothing unusual most of them are "sleeping"
01:26	<PAStheLoD>	|box|, the reposities are using HTTP and FTP , and that's totally different from BitTorrent .. azureus has a nice way for distributing it's packages .. that can be implemented and then you  would only need to get the tiny torrent files from the repos
01:26	<[IT]4ngelus>	i can hear sound only if i disable acpi, but then video card won't work, could someone help?
01:26	<Ex-Cyber>	how can I do a search on Ubuntu forums requiring all keywords instead of any keyword?
01:26	<|Flood|>	such as what is mentionned on theregister.co.uk
01:26	<cousin_luigi>	xtlosx: she has to do it from console
01:26	<ezzieyguywuf>	ex-cyber: quotes?
01:26	<cousin_luigi>	I suppose
01:26	<|box|>	PAStheLoD:  are they thinking of implementing  that?
01:26	<PAStheLoD>	Ex-Cyber, use the quotation marks  """""" " " " "
01:27	<cousin_luigi>	|Flood|: depends if the GPU can handle it
01:27	<StatusQuo>	any ideas on how to get amarok and mp3s working under 7.10?
01:27	<xtlosx>	OK, how do you do that
01:27	<xtlosx>	I tried
01:27	<Lunks>	Hi, I'd like to know how to change libnotify popups' colors. Right now, gtk themes only change some part of it (a semi circle is missing).
01:27	<Ex-Cyber>	PAStheLoD: what's the syntax?
01:27	<ezzieyguywuf>	anyone know how to get amarok to recognize the media keys on my thinkpad?
01:27	<Name141-->	LOL, I am having to use the computer's IP# , not the name.
01:27	<xtlosx>	I changed everything in the sources.list to gutsy, and did a apt-get upadte, and dist-upgrade and it only had two packages
01:27	<Lunks>	haha um brasileiro. :P
01:27	<ademan>	ezzieyguywuf: there might be a plugin for amarok
01:27	<xtlosx>	held a bunch back
01:27	<Pici>	!br | Lunks
01:27	<EruditeHermit>	nrp: thanks for the info btw
01:27	<ezzieyguywuf>	ademan: haven't had any luck finding one....
01:27	<Lunks>	Pici: I was just welcoming a Brazilian. :P
01:27	<|Flood|>	cousin_luigi prolly true... i'm installing this in a VM
01:27	<PAStheLoD>	|box|,  you already have the ability to download a lots of things from the releases.ubuntu.com via BT .. but I don't know anything about implementing Bt into aptitude / apt-get .. etc
01:27	<bur[n]er>	hi all, just wanted to paste http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/gutsy/desktop/ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent  since people will inevitably ask
01:27	<cousin_luigi>	xtlosx: not sure then
01:27	<flick>	the synaptic package manger seems to be more powerful than the Add/Remove... why do we have two package managers?
01:27	<Lunks>	Pici: I was just welcoming a Brazilian. :P
01:27	<Pici>	Lunks: Oh. nevermind ;)_
01:27	<dpvnme>	how do you chmod the file alsa-base
01:27	<Lunks>	Hi, I'd like to know how to change libnotify popups' colors. Right now, gtk themes only change some part of it (a semi circle is missing).
01:28	<Charlotte>	im thinking that this is may be my bluethoot
01:28	<cousin_luigi>	xtlosx: I've done a reinstall
01:28	<xtlosx>	how do you do it from the console, does anyone know
01:28	<bur[n]er>	flick: because synaptic is "scary"
01:28	<bur[n]er>	:)
01:28	<Charlotte>	running all the time
01:28	<xtlosx>	oh she doesn't want to do a reinstall
01:28	<Lunks>	Pici: Don't mind. :)
01:28	<xtlosx>	just the upgrade
01:28	<PAStheLoD>	Ex-Cyber,   if you want to search for cat food then "cat food" .. enclose the search terms in quotation marks
01:28	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi. IcemanV9: re-started X. Same problem, and on restricted drivers manager I see only one nvidia driver and it's already enables... Please help :(
01:28	<Charlotte>	how to turn it off
01:28	<sean>	Is there a mirror available for synaptic that I can use to download stuff from repositories on? The servers are so slow right now.
01:28	<|box|>	i downloaded vista  didnt like it ripped it off and went back to xp pro  downloaded this and i like  this linux most everything worked out of the box
01:28	<catach>	flick: power/usability tradeoffs, so two target user profiles?
01:28	<RB2>	flick: Lower-level items like required libraries, etc. can be downloaded from the Package Manager.
01:28	<cousin_luigi>	xtlosx: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade should do the trick
01:28	<Pici>	Lunks: I've looked into this before, I havent found a way to do it yet :(
01:28	<xtlosx>	hmmm it doesn't
01:28	<Pici>	Lunks: regarding the libnotify thing
01:28	<xtlosx>	it just lets her install two packages
01:28	<IanLiu>	OK, now we are going fast!
01:28	<xtlosx>	and that's it
01:28	<|Flood|>	Ex-Cyber yeah otherwise you'll get scores about eating cats :)
01:28	<kitche>	sean: yes but the other mirrors would be most likely slow as well
01:28	<ezzieyguywuf>	is suspend still broken in gutsy?
01:28	<xtlosx>	holds bac a bunch
01:28	<dpvnme>	hi guy, i'm trying to chmod the file alsa-base, can't seem to do it.
01:28	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: you mean it's still using nv?
01:28	<Lunks>	Pici: oh, yeah. I'm trying this for a long time. ;P
01:29	<iapx8088>	hello
01:29	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: how can you tell?
01:29	<iapx8088>	I have an issue with the upgrade: update-manager seems to stuck, as well as do-relase-upgrade, but the mirror seems fine. Any idea?
01:29	<murphyg>	kitche (or anyone), does anyone know how I can get the NVIDIA X driver working?   nvidia-xconfig isn't doing it...
01:29	<Pici>	Lunks: Theres a gconf key that you can change, but it only changes some of the themeing.
01:29	<sean>	kitche, faster though? They are REALLY slow and I need sound! :P I guess I could just compile the code I need.
01:29	<xtlosx>	seems like a bunch of people are having issues upgrading with the upgrade manaer or whtever it is
01:29	<AZimm>	Okay I know there's probably a lot of support requests but I just upgraded to gutsy. When I rebooted, booting stops with a flashing cursor right after the bootsplash. Normal boot worked on Fiesty...
01:29	<Lunks>	Pici: Not the same circle, right? :(
01:29	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: wait a moment...is your nvidia card an old model?
01:29	<Lunks>	semi-circle*
01:29	<kbreit>	During the install, when it tries to update via apt, is there a timeout built in?
01:29	<Lunks>	Pici: Can you tell me where?
01:29	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: The same openGL problem is still happening and I see what seems to be the same thing in restricted drivers manager
01:29	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: perhaps it's incompatible with nvidia-glx-new, and requires nvidia-glx instead
01:29	<Pici>	Lunks: I'm not sure, I'd have to google it.
01:30	<cousin_luigi>	hmm
01:30	<|Flood|>	i thought this version of ubuntu already came with gutsy
01:30	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: It's Nvidia 6200
01:30	<Lifeisfunny>	Does someone have the url for 7.10 MD5 Hashes?
01:30	<Lunks>	Pici: Nevermind, I'll try myself. :)
01:30	<autumnx>	hi i am trying to access fdisk on linux, i want to remove it off my computer and reinstall win xp
01:30	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: same here
01:30	<Ex-Cyber>	quotes don't seem to make any difference

01:30	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: and it works
01:30	<kst>	is there a way to configure how/if gutsy automatically starts Xgl for compiz? I'm on ATI and want to use proprietary drivers for performance issues..
01:30	<|Flood|>	PAStheLoD crap :/
01:30	<|box|>	is there an apt get for realplayer reason i ask BBC radio 1 dont work without realplayer
01:30	<AZimm>	Lifeisfunny: most of the mirrors have them if you can't find them on the main server

01:30	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cool
01:30	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: it worked out of the box

01:31	<PAStheLoD>	|box|,  VLC can stream realmedia , can't it?
01:31	<Lifeisfunny>	the link   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes   doesn't have the 7.10's
01:31	<AZimm>	Lifeisfunny: Go here http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors
01:31	<kitche>	!xgl | kst it's probably the same as in feisty most likely
01:31	<|Flood|>	PAStheLoD what got me to give this a try is it supposedly is able to read/write to windows file system
01:31	<autumnx>	how do i access the fdisk on linux?
01:31	<StatusQuo>	storms....hate the power outages
01:31	<lwizardl>	hi
01:31	<Lifeisfunny>	AZimm, thanks
01:31	<autumnx>	i need to access it to remove linux
01:31	<AZimm>	I found one in the main gutsy folder on the server I used
01:32	<kitche>	autumnx: fdisk is the command
01:32	<|box|>	PAStheLoD:  yea but BBC expresly say you need either realplayer or win media player even though i love vlc
01:32	<lwizardl>	how do I either install or enable the gnome theme manager on 7.10?
01:32	<Apeezee>	Is anyone else having problems upgrading to gutsy?
01:32	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: http://pastebin.ca/741840
01:32	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: could be the glx extension though
01:32	<kitche>	|box|: bbc has a linux iplayer version
01:32	<AZimm>	Apeezee: I am but it's after the upgrade
01:32	<autumnx>	but when i type it it just gives me a list and i dunno where to start
01:32	<Apeezee>	Hrm
01:32	<|Flood|>	|box| i tried vlc and it's not intuitive nor user friendly
01:32	<kst>	kitche any idea where the parameters for the automatic Xgl start are set in gutsy? and how should i install the ati drivers from website? do i need to uninstall something first?
01:32	<kitche>	Apeezee: umm servers are being hammered right now
01:32	<iapx8088>	is it advised to use apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade?
01:32	<Apeezee>	I am trying to update but i keep getting errors
01:32	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: What do you mean?
01:32	<rryan>	Hi, I'm upgrading a laptop to 7.10, and in the process, xscreensaver turned on and locked the display. Libpam and so on was replaced by the upgrade, and now it doesn't accept my password to unlock it. What should I do ?
01:32	<DShepherd>	lwizardl, under preferences -- appearances
01:32	<AZimm>	Apeezee: I agree it's probably the servers
01:32	<PAStheLoD>	|Flood|,  i can tell you that Ubuntu is capable of doing such marvelous things .. I'm copying from an NTFS drive to another .. ATM ;]
01:32	<Apeezee>	kitche: yea, thats what i was figuring..
01:32	<|box|>	kitche:  bbc do? cool i look
01:32	<Ex-Cyber>	PAStheLoD: quoted and non-quoted seem to give me identical results
01:32	<PovAddic1>	rryan: wow, fun...
01:33	<witless>	you must be using air quotes
01:33	<|Flood|>	PAStheLoD ahhhhhhh.. that's got to be sweet... thanks :)
01:33	<murphyg>	kitche: any ideas on what should go into my xorg.conf ?
01:33	<kitche>	kst: you usually just pick xgl in the session menu
01:33	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: check my cfg at the bottom
01:33	<kitche>	murphyg: for what nvidia?
01:33	<rryan>	PovAddic1: yea ... :)     how bad is it to restart during the upgrade?
01:33	<|box|>	i use vlc a lot but i use foober 2000 for flac? ahhh thats a point whats the flac player for linux?
01:33	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: kk, hold on
01:33	<RB2>	iapx8088: yes, I believe so. I personally did a fresh install.
01:33	<AZimm>	Help me  please: Would the new Xorg stuff be why I can't boot?
01:33	<murphyg>	kitche: for nVIDIA 8600 GT (dual monitors)
01:33	<PovAddic1>	rryan: I dunno, I'm just about to start my fresh install and hopefully get rid of windoze
01:33	<kitche>	|box|: any player can play flac really
01:33	<xtlosx>	vlc is as user friendly as it's going to get..
01:34	<xtlosx>	lol how much easier do you want it to be!
01:34	<etank>	anyone having problems loading Gutsy?
01:34	<Charlotte>	lol i saw it
01:34	<iapx8088>	ok, will try something
01:34	<kitche>	murphyg: driver "nvidia" you want for your card so if it says driver "nv" change that to " nvidia"
=== slimjimAFK is now known as slimjimflim
01:34	<|box|>	k kitche thanks for help im a n00b at this just got it
01:34	<newbie1>	I just completed the compilation of HDAINTEL sound for alsa on the entire setup now it wants me to reboot but there are some things after that in the page specifically saying "manuelly Specify Module Parameters" do i need to do these too?
01:34	<lwizardl>	DShepherd, thanks I've got about like 50 themes I want to try from gnome-look
01:34	<SideyB>	Anyone got experience with ffmpeg?
01:34	<iapx8088>	RB2, thanks fot the support
01:34	<iapx8088>	nn
01:34	<PovAddic1>	SideyB: I DO
01:34	<aardvark4>	hey guys, a quick question: i'm about to install gutsy over my feisty install, and i have a separate partition for /home.  The gutsy installer tells me "there were no users or operating systems suitable for importing from." and then asks me to create a new user.. if i use the same username and tell it to mount (but NOT format) the partition as /home, it isn't going to overwrite all of my data there, is it?
01:34	<etank>	all i get after an install is a black screen
01:34	<Pakalaka>	I am trying to upgrade from feisty and the installaton crashes a beagelDeamon.exe and refuses to continue.  Any one getting this as well?
01:34	<Apeezee>	etank: It won't even download all the packages for me right now :)
01:34	<Charlotte>	it was copuz hit 39%
01:34	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu and a USB mouse works fine in the same port (and all the others). If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
01:34	<PovAddic1>	SideyB: but I g2g install gutsy, ask in #ffmpeg :)
01:34	<etank>	i got to try to log in once
01:34	<etank>	Apeezee: i was seeing that too
01:34	<haru>	where are the lock files for firefox please?
01:34	<RB2>	iapx8088: Anytime
01:34	<SideyB>	ok
01:34	<Apeezee>	etank: yea, it keeps failing on some files
01:34	<SideyB>	thanks
01:35	<Apeezee>	etank: is that the same issue u are having?>
01:35	<PovAddic1>	SideyB: by the way, it's highly recommended that ffmpeg is compiled from source, you'll probably get flamed in #ffmpeg if you use the binary from apt as it's probably old
01:35	<|Flood|>	PAStheLoD so with today's ubuntu release is there something else i need to download to get the gutsy GUI?
01:35	<|box|>	i do like this better than  xp :)  and vista just suxs
01:35	<PovAddic1>	kthxbye
01:35	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: should I add those lines if they aren't there already and give it another shot?
01:35	<etank>	Apeezee: "Scanning ..."
01:35	<rryan>	Err, hah I'm dumb. I just switched to a console, logged in and killed xscreensaver... nevermind
01:35	<StatusQuo>	The following packages have unmet dependencies:
01:35	<StatusQuo>	  w32codecs: Depends: libstdc++5 (>= 1:3.3.4-1) but it is not installable
01:35	<murphyg>	kitche: the xorg.conf file does have "Driver "nvidia" "   however nvidia-settings complains that the NVIDIA X driver isn't loaded....
01:35	<PovAddic1>	|box|: Vista is Windows ME 2.0
01:35	<SideyB>	aight
01:35	<autumnx>	i am having trouble using fdisk
01:35	<StatusQuo>	any ideas?
01:35	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: yes
01:35	<SideyB>	thanks
01:35	<JohnKarahalis>	Hello everybody
01:35	<etank>	Apeezee: it will finally install but i can not get to a login screen
01:35	<Apeezee>	etank: hmm....  I get to the point where it is downloading packages, but then gives me an error
01:35	<haru>	PovAddic1, lol
01:35	<Lifeisfunny>	AZimm, new problem, I got my dl from MIT Media Lab and they aren't letting me on the mirror site  :\

01:35	<JohnKarahalis>	is anybody in this room a developer?
01:35	<ademan>	crap this is driving me insane, nothing is working in the gutsy liveCD, and i checked the cd for errors and all is good
01:36	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: I have two lines in the beginning of my xorg.conf: Load "glx" and Load "v4l"
01:36	<AZimm>	Lifeisfunny: Try one of the other servers; they should have the same md5
01:36	<etank>	Apeezee: you should be able to install with no network straight from the CD
01:36	<vocx>	haru, what are lock files?
01:36	<ademan>	JohnKarahalis: in what sense? i program stuff, not for ubuntu though
01:36	<vocx>	!patience >	haru
01:36	<|box|>	ademan:  did you burn the live cd as an iso?
01:36	<etank>	Apeezee: so packages shouldn't need to be downloaded
01:36	<Apeezee>	etank: eck, that means download from torrent. :P
01:36	<AronRaavHex>	is it just me or is the fonts on web pages in ubuntu weird/ugly looking, i've tried both opera and firefox but the fonts just don't look as good as in windows or os x, especially s's and w's
01:36	<Lifeisfunny>	AZimm, ok, kinda new at this
01:36	<haru>	vocx, these are the files that dont let u run another session of firefox on same profile
01:36	<autumnx>	i am having trouble using fdisk on linux
01:36	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: what happens if you launch glxgears? a crash?
01:36	<Apeezee>	etank: i have CDs supposedly on the way in the mail sometime
01:36	<JohnKarahalis>	well, does anybody here work for canonical as a developer? I'm looking to interview a Canonical developer for a school project.
01:36	<PAStheLoD>	|Flood|,  the release contains a bunch of updates to a lots of components .. and the GUI is just a tiny bit of that..
01:36	<haru>	so now when i try to run ff it says its already running
01:36	<Apeezee>	but my patience is not that strong
01:36	<ademan>	|box|: of course, i mean, it booted too, but when i try to run certain apps i get either a "Bus error" or an "input/output error"
01:36	<haru>	paitience suxx
01:36	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: I believe so, but let me do it again hold on
01:36	<Apeezee>	yea
01:36	<etank>	Apeezee: i mean that if you have the CD you should be able to install from it without a network
01:36	<IcemanV9>	AronRaavHex: install m$ fonts then
01:37	<autumnx>	i am having trouble using fdisk on linux
01:37	<StatusQuo>	any ideas what's causing this:  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
01:37	<StatusQuo>	  w32codecs: Depends: libstdc++5 (>= 1:3.3.4-1) but it is not installable
01:37	<Apeezee>	etank: I dont have cd, i am updating from w/in fiesty

01:37	<haru>	;)
01:37	<vocx>	!error >	autumnx
01:37	<ademan>	JohnKarahalis: #ubuntu-devel
01:37	<AZimm>	Lifeisfunny: That's alright; find anything?
01:37	<|box|>	ademan:  i burned as an iso with brn4free  and it worked a treat
01:37	<cousin_luigi>	autumnx: then use gparted instead
01:37	<`m0>	wo00t .. I am still updating ubuntu... And many stuff failed
01:37	<tbuss>	haru: when that happens to me in FF i use htop to kill the process
01:37	<etank>	Apeezee: i see
01:37	<JohnKarahalis>	ademan: I'm in there, and no one is responding :(
01:37	<Apeezee>	`mo: yea, me2
01:37	<Co2|>	Hello, I just downloaded ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso from bittorent, burnt it on a cd and tried to boot from the cd without success. Is there a known problem about it ?
01:37	<|Flood|>	PAStheLoD i'm about to find out... the install is going through its first reboot
01:37	<ademan>	JohnKarahalis: ah, well just be patient
01:37	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: 2 errors: Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0". and Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual
01:37	<Lifeisfunny>	AZimm, yeah, it checks out
01:37	<JohnKarahalis>	yes yes, thanks
01:37	<etank>	Apeezee: it aint much better with the CD though
01:37	<Apeezee>	lol
01:37	<JohnKarahalis>	thanks
01:37	<haru>	tbuss, that happens cos older session of firefox has issued a lock
01:38	<Apeezee>	etank: I had a weird feeling about upgrading...
01:38	<haru>	tbuss, sadly i cant kill ff as its not running at all
01:38	<AronRaavHex>	IcemanV9, i've installed msttcorefonts and set firefox to use times new roman but it still don't look good, can anyone confirm that s and w's looks awful?
01:38	<|box|>	the more i play the more i wanna learn i think this linux is gonna be more addictive than ebay :)
01:38	<`m0>	"The upgrade aborts now, your system could be in an un an unusable state"
01:38	<caner>	ive installed nvidia-glx and started using berly (with gutsy) but i have a problem that it blink once a few second which is really annoying. anyone had the same problem here?
01:38	<IcemanV9>	Co2|: md5sum your recently iso to be sure ...
01:38	<Lifeisfunny>	AZimm, I got the one that begins  d2334dbba...   and it's good
01:38	<haru>	tbuss, in my case i copied over my old profile directly hence copyin the lock files
01:38	<`m0>	I wish I just clean installled ...
01:38	<Apeezee>	`mo: i got that too
01:38	<Apeezee>	last night
01:38	<etank>	Apeezee: i never upgrade
01:38	<ademan>	k i'm gonna re-burn the live cd and see if i have any better luck
01:38	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: I don't know..happened to me in the past
01:38	<AZimm>	Lifeisfunny - Sweet
01:38	<Co2|>	IcemanV9: Good idea, I'll do that right now
01:38	<rbrtw>	when I enable Desktop Effects the font size of the Window title becomes really big
01:38	<punzada>	has anyone installed gusty in virtualbox, I get a kernel panic cpu is too old as soon as I load the server edition
01:38	<etank>	Apeezee: it always seems to cause problems
01:38	<Apeezee>	etank: yea, usually better to clean install
01:38	<flick>	!nice
01:38	<rgallego>	hello
01:38	<IcemanV9>	AronRaavHex: really? hm. it looks fine on mine
01:38	<Apeezee>	etank: but i hate backing up all my crap
01:38	<|box|>	ademan:  burn as an iso
01:38	<vocx>	haru, well you may take a look at your hidden folders in your home directory, maybe .mozilla or .firefox
01:38	<tatortot>	is there any body who can help me with a usb grub install, I get a black screen with only the word grub
01:38	<`m0>	This is bogus , they should of made it as easy as Service Pack installs in Windows :/
01:39	<Apeezee>	LOL~
01:39	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: I think removing the driver and reistalling it fixed the issue, but I'm not sure
01:39	<rgallego>	how do I activate the cube on ubuntu 7.10
01:39	<haru>	vocx, did :) cant find it
01:39	<Apeezee>	`mo: Never say that again. :P

01:39	<`m0>	I am getting hte SAME error as before
01:39	<Lifeisfunny>	night folks
01:39	<AronRaavHex>	IcemanV9, what fonts are you using, and are you using firefox?
01:39	<flick>	`m0: made what as easy?
01:39	<kyleBAKED>	what is the best way to go about getting xfce working on ubuntu?
01:39	<demon_spork>	how much HDD space would be required to make a new mirror for the gutsy repositories?
01:39	<kyleBAKED>	repo or compiling
01:39	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
01:39	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: so I apt-get remove nvidia-glx-new, restart X and then apt-get install it again?
01:39	<AZimm>	Anyone know anything about Xorg problems with Gutsy?
01:39	<`m0>	It is aasking me to install  sun-java6-doc , I don't know why... It is always failing1
01:39	<ubotu>	Lunks: Por favor use #ubuntu-br ou #ubuntu-pt para ajuda em português. Obrigado.
01:39	<vocx>	!desktop >	kyleBAKED
01:39	<|box|>	fire fox runs faster in linux than on me  xp lol ffs
01:39	<ubotu>	kst it's probably the same as in feisty most likely: Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager
01:39	<Cryoniq>	Blama: Looking around about that error message, but no luck yet.. but.. hmm.. is it by any chance plugged into a USB hub? If it is, try test another usb port. Maybe no luck, but can't hurt to try.
01:40	<ubotu>	The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications ->	Accessories ->	Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu ->	System ->	Konsole (KDE).  Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
01:40	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: disable it from restricted driver manager before
01:40	<haru>	|box|, ff is compiled better for nix
01:40	<`m0>	nice update messed up
01:40	<dvoid_>	hey , whats that program called, that gives you a graphical view of all current connections on the network?
01:40	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: and have it install it next time
01:40	<`m0>	That means, if we install Ubuntu, we have to reinstall ubuntu every 6 months
01:40	<Pici>	dvoid_: etherape
01:40	<Blama>	cryoniq: very detailed post here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=580372
01:40	<flick>	i don't know, as a first hand user i am pretty impressed with ubuntu... seems to be working quite well so far for me, things are very intuitive
01:40	<haru>	vocx, lol ubotu asked me to look at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines for paitience, if only i could do that :P
01:40	<PAStheLoD>	`m0 lol :D
01:40	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: so, 1) disable from restricted drivers, 2) restart X, 3) apt-get remove, 4) apt-get install <-Is this correct?
01:40	<|box|>	ok do i need a firewall  or is me firmware firewall  good enough?
01:40	<dvoid_>	Pici, aaah tanx :D
01:40	<Cryoniq>	Blama: nice :)
01:40	<`m0>	cause you have to be lucky to be in the case which it works if updating is successfull
01:40	<`m0>	:<
01:41	<demon_spork>	how much HDD space would be required to make a new mirror for the gutsy repositories?
01:41	<kst>	ubotu kitche but how does it work in gutsy: does it check for aiglx first, if not available uses xgl?
01:41	<Apeezee>	`mo: Just cause it isn't working right now, doesen't mean it is a software issues
01:41]  * haru cries
01:41	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: oh and f course, step 5: enable it on restricted drivers again
01:41	<rbrtw>	anyone know why the font size of the window title is really big when I enable Desktop Effects?
01:41	<Apeezee>	`m0: there are probally about 1.6 gazillion people tryin gto upgrade right now
01:41	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	correct?
01:41	<rgallego>	anyone could tell me how to activate the cube on gutsy?
01:41	<rbrtw>	all other font sizes are fine
01:41	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: try to reboot instead of ctrl-alt-backspace
01:41	<haru>	anyone knows where are the lock files for firefox please?
01:41	<H264>	demon_spork: ~30 gigs
01:41	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: it doesn't make much sense though
01:41	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin ok, be right back
01:41	<demon_spork>	H246, how would one go about making a mirror and adding it to the current network of mirrors?
01:42	<the_darkside_986>	ok... i cannot get X-server to work at all in the livecd and my card is Nvidia 7300 GS pci-express. i tried altering xorg.conf to use "nv" and "vesa" but neither of those will work. the (EE) is something about AIGLX: Dri not supported on screen 0. does anyone know what the correct workaround is for this. (i've tried booting both default and failsafe modes)
01:42	<cdm10>	So, I'm installing 7.10 from a CD, and it's stuck at the "Scanning the Mirror" step, probably because most of the mirrors are down. There used to be a cancel thingy, but now it's not there.
01:42	<MarcN>	haru:  look in ~/.firefox/
01:42	<`m0>	Apeezee: according to the forums, 90% of them are formatting it
01:42	<Jonfish>	does fglrx come with gutsy automatically??
01:42	<cdm10>	Is it ever going to time out?

01:42	<demon_spork>	cdm10, just wait 15 to 20 minutes
01:42	<cdm10>	demon_spork: yeah, but it would be nice to be able to skip this step, like previous versions could.
01:42	<kitche>	|box|: beeb?

01:43	<vocx>	the_darkside_986, maybe you could avoid loading aiglx and glx modules in the xorg.conf, in the load section.
01:43	<Cryoniq>	Blama: Weird problem.. tried look at compaq forums?
01:43	<Pici>	|box|: no.  no mac plugin, no linux plugin.

01:43	<Apeezee>	openbysource: A lot of people are having issues with updating now, including me
01:43	<mike05>	for the mirrors problem
01:43	<cdm10>	dan_: System>Administration>Restricted Drivers Manager
01:43	<mike05>	i had to unplug the network cable
01:43	<punzada>	openbysource, mine was stuck there for around 20 mins and then it continued
01:43	<rbrtw>	rg: install compiz settings manager, System ->	Preferences ->	Advanced Desktop Effects, check Desktop Cube and Rotate Cube
01:44	<Pici>	|box|: sorry, listen to kitche , I apparently dont know what I'm talking about

01:44	<b33r>	Hello when I do sudo lshw -C cpu, the cpu size is 1998MHz although I have intel core 2 duo E6750 2.66GHz, is this normal? :/
01:44	<autumnx>	ok i am on gparted how do i remove partitions?
01:44	<Pici>	kitche: Whats the thing about bbc's plugin lock-in to windows that I've been reading about?
01:44	<tbuss>	haru: The application may have shut down abnormally, leaving the lock in place. To fix this, open the  profile folder and delete the file Profile folders are contained in ~/.mozilla/firefox/ "lock" and ".parentlock"
01:44	<Blama>	cryoniq, yeah, no luck... ill just leave the post there to rot for a little see what someone says
01:44	<cdm10>	why won't it timeout, and why have they removed the cancel button at this step?
01:44	<taime1>	is the installation of the broadcom wireless cards the same as it was in feisty??
01:44	<v3ctor>	b33r: may have scaled down
01:44	<cdm10>	taime1: should be, yes.
01:44	<v3ctor>	b33r: they do tht when not fully used
01:44	<cdm10>	taime1: unless restricted drivers manager handles it now.
01:44	<cdm10>	taime1: you may want to check that.
01:44	<taime1>	i see
01:45	<autumnx>	i am on gparted, how do i remove partitions?
01:45	<kitche>	Pici: people made bbc support all three platforms but doesn't seem to be until christmas when it fully comes out sicne I did a search for bbc linux iplayer and found bunch of links for it
01:45	<the_darkside_986>	is there a way to make gutsy try to start a Normal x server not this odd one that won't work...? failsafe mode does not seem to do that...
01:45	<b33r>	v3ctor, are you sure?
01:45	<Pici>	kitche: ah :)
01:45	<|box|>	Pici:  is the iplayer just tied into   xp will they be releasing mac and linux players?
01:45	<b33r>	v3ctor, is there a way to check my cpu speed?
01:45	<heatfan>	i am having problems connecting to my wireless internet, if i boot with the CD i can log on to my wireless internet, but if i boot with hard drive i can't connect, can anyone help?
01:45	<haru>	tbuss, so apparantly my session isnt locked
01:45	<Pici>	|box|: ask kitche, he seems to be better informed than I
01:45	<autumnx>	i am on gparted, how do i remove partitions?
01:45	<haru>	and yet my ff went kapuy
01:45	<demon_spork>	after installling Gutsy, it stalls each boot after running fsck
01:45	<kitche>	Pici: it's going to be in flash but right now it's only windows media format
01:45	<autumnx>	i am on gparted, how do i remove partitions?
01:46	<kitche>	|box|: look up bbc linux iplayer and it should fill you in
01:46	<flick>	hi, i just restarted with NVidia restricted driver, it is working fine but doesn't allow me to go beyond 1024x768
01:46	<the_darkside_986>	how are you nvidia people successfully making the livecd show a desktop and not a blank screen?
01:46	<vocx>	!repeat >	autumnx
01:46	<C-ROC>	Do I need to remove "NeroLinux" or "Google Desktop" before I upgrade to Gutsy?
01:46	<flick>	how can i edit the configurations to get higher resolutions?
01:46	<openbysource>	i hope after the installation is finished it will not get stucked with downloading the restricted format stuff (as it's not part of ubuntu) ?
01:46	<tbuss>	haru: ?
01:46	<demon_spork>	the_darkside_986, which card do you have?
01:46	<cdm10>	C-ROC: You probably should
01:46	<C-ROC>	grrr...ok
01:46	<haru>	tbuss, apparantly ls -la doesnt list .parentlock.. just deleted it works fine now
01:46	<haru>	tbuss, thanks a lot
01:46	<|box|>	ewwww F just crashed
01:46	<Apeezee>	openbysource: just be happy if it installs and works :)
01:46	<C-ROC>	i was just hoping not to have to re-index nearly 2TB :P
01:46	<trpr>	so my upgrade completed. X was extremely sluggish. I discovered xserver-xgl was being used for some reason.. removed it. all is well :)
01:46	<C-ROC>	thanks
01:46	<tbuss>	haru: np
01:47	<|box|>	ewww FF just died :(
01:47	<openbysource>	Apeezee: yeah while we talk here it has just finished.
01:47	<Apeezee>	lucky.
01:47	<`m0>	I rebooted my updated gutsy, and now I don't see the user listing when loggin on
01:47	<CoasterMaster>	so it's relatively normal that I can't connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com today, right?
01:47	<emeriste>	How can I check if I am running a firewall?
01:47	<Apeezee>	My update manager is apparently knee-deep in mud and is currently spinning it's wheels
01:47	<kitche>	CoasterMaster: yes read the /topic
01:47	<openbysource>	Apeezee: but it didn't said anything like it's finished or something like that. it just finished and got closed. had made some drive icons on the desktop though.
01:47	<Apeezee>	coaster: prolly :)
01:47	<vocx>	autumnx, GParted is easy to use. Just select delete or erase partition and create a new one in the unallocated space. You need to run from the Live CD or make sure your partitions are not mounted when attempting to to changes.
01:47	<CoasterMaster>	kitche, thanks
01:48	<Apeezee>	openbysource: reboot, see wha happens :P
01:48	<demon_spork>	the_darkside_986: which card do you have?
01:48	<autumnx>	ok thanks
01:48	<openbysource>	Apeezee: okay.
01:48	<|box|>	is it normally this busy ?
01:48	<cousin_luigi>	goodnight
01:48	<emeriste>	Is there a way to check if I am running a firewall?
01:48	<bashveank>	are you running ubuntu?
01:48	<bashveank>	than yes you are
01:48	<emeriste>	Yes.
01:48	<emeriste>	How can I know that
01:48	<heatfan>	i am having problems connecting to my wireless internet, if i boot with the CD i can log on to my wireless internet, but if i boot with hard drive i can't connect, can anyone help?
01:48	<PAStheLoD>	emeriste, yes  a lots of online security checks are for that
01:48	<emeriste>	Like what?
01:49	<Pici>	!firewall | emeriste
01:49	<ubotu>	emeriste: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
01:49	<emeriste>	I thought there would be a way to look at something and see if it's on.
01:49	<nrdb>	I have put in an applet that monitors eth0, it is always showing activity, does a NFS mount use bandwidth even when not being accessed.
01:49	<emeriste>	Pici - so it's available but does that mean it's on?
01:49	<Pici>	emeriste: no, it means its on, but configurable only with those tools
01:49	<|box|>	OI ffs i can pull off media files from me Xp hdd holly molly im impressed
01:49	<vocx>	emeriste, ask your real question. Why do you want to know if you are behind a firewall?
01:50	<`m0>	Ah nooo, not again... when I updated 7.04 to 7.10, it is hanging up on ALL apt-get commands, it is thinking I have something to install, it always points to jdk-6-doc installation
01:50	<nbjayme>	i have two nics one onboard via_rhine and one realtek8139c.  the kernel recognized it and assigned it as eth1 and eth0 respectively.  but network manager shows only eth0 and eth2????? where did eth1 go?
01:50	<the_darkside_986>	demon_spork: i have the nvidia 7300 GS card on pci-express
01:50	<`m0>	beh
01:50	<kitche>	emeriste: iptables -L should give you a rulle set if you do have one in place
01:50	<haru>	tbuss, ok i deleted .parentlock and theres no lockfile.. and yet it doesnt run :(
01:50	<tbuss>	emeriste: http://www.hackerwatch.org/probe/
01:50	<emeriste>	I want to know if installing pidentd will put my privacy more at risk on IRC
01:50	<haru>	tbuss, isnt copying over a profile folder supposed to work?
01:50	<demon_spork>	the_darkside_986, when you boot the liveCD, try hitting "alt+ctrl+backspace" after it finishes booting and just displays the blank screen
01:50	<kitche>	emeriste: there is no such thing as privacy anymore on irc :)
01:50	<Apeezee>	lol
01:51	<Veinor>	not if you configure it right
01:51	<the_darkside_986>	demon_spork: i have done that and it just comes back up. the gnome music plays but there is still a blank screen.
01:51	<emeriste>	That's why I said "more at risk"
01:51	<demon_spork>	hmm
01:51	<tbuss>	haru: sorry but I have to run, this might help though http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_in_use
01:51	<|box|>	is my firmware firewall  acting as a proxy?
01:51	<kitche>	emeriste: with it and without it it won't matter anyways
01:51	<demon_spork>	the_darkside_986, don't know what else to do
01:51	<the_darkside_986>	demon_spork: i have managed to be able to kill gdm and edit an xorg.conf file but nothing seems to make the blank screen and AIGLX error quit
01:51	<haru>	tbuss, cant open browser :P
01:51	<MarcN>	|box|: doubtful.
01:52	<`m0>	It is saving in thte /var/lib/dpkg/info/ directory all the failed installtions :S
01:52	<tbuss>	haru: right :P
01:52	<Choji>	ubuntu 7.10 is taking a while to upgrade
01:52	<Choji>	lol
01:52	<kitche>	the_darkside_986: the blank screen is most likely a bug with the nvidia binary drivers just don't use them or upgrade them manually
01:52	<jkimball4>	Does #ubuntu+1 redirect to #ubuntu, currently?
01:52	<demon_spork>	the_darkside_986, I got it working on my 8800GTS and on my GF4 MX440, don't know what to do for your 7300
01:52	<Apeezee>	wth, it keeps getting to 99% of the multiverse source file, then says failed in the update manager
01:52	<Apeezee>	grr
01:52	<tbuss>	haru: ok, hold on
01:52	<kitche>	jkimball4: probably
01:52	<`m0>	So I have to remove each installtion that has a postinst extension
01:52	<haru>	tbuss, thanks :D
01:52	<vocx>	the_darkside_986, are you sure that is the only error? Search for other errors in the X logs.
01:52	<Madpilot>	jkimball4, yes. Until the next version is started, in two-three weeks
01:52	<the_darkside_986>	demon_spork: did you do anything special or it just booted up fine? and yes that is the only error i could find in the file.
01:52	<|box|>	then my pc isnt at all protected just went to http://www.hackerwatch.org/probe and they  bent me over and   could get what ever they needed
01:52	<tbuss>	haru: try starting in from cli for error messages?
01:52	<localgod11>	ok i have 2 gig of ram so i have been told that i can should limit my swap file to 1 gb
01:53	<OldakQuill>	Hi, my Update Manager freezes whenever I try to upgrade to 7.10
01:53	<Choji>	o ya
01:53	<Choji>	theres a lot of people
01:53	<localgod11>	any truth to that?
01:53	<Choji>	downloading it
01:53	<haru>	tbuss, none.. jsut says ff already running
01:53	<demon_spork>	I can't get gutsy to stop running fsck and trying to fix "superblock last mount time is in the future." every single time, like it never actually fixes it, just says that it does
01:53	<kitche>	|box|: by the way using an online scan is a very bad security practice :) sicne they tend to log ips and the scans
01:53	<tbuss>	haru: do you have htop installed?
01:53	<demon_spork>	and it also freezes after trying to do that
01:53	<Choji>	lol
01:53	<haru>	tbuss, yes
01:53	<kitche>	demon_spork: means your system time is setup wrong
01:53	<|box|>	need a good firewall  any sug?
01:53	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu and a USB mouse works fine in the same port (and all the others). If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
01:53	<Choji>	whats your guys download rate for ubuntu upgrade
01:54	<kitche>	|box|: iptables
01:54	<vocx>	localgod11, swap is used as additional RAM. If you have plenty you do not need more than 1 GB swap. But if you want to hibernate all your RAM then you need as much swap as you have RAM.
01:54	<the_darkside_986>	does the binary nvidia driver ship with the gutsy live cd? how would i tell xorg.conf to use that one?
01:54	<kitche>	Choji: read the /topic
01:54	<MarcN>	|box|: get a cheap little linksys or other firewall/router device.
01:54	<demon_spork>	kitche, yeah, but when that has happened before it just fixed it and goes on with the boot, but gutsy just stops after running fsck and sits there
01:54	<localgod11>	so so 2gb swap
01:54	<Apeezee>	Choji: mine is all FUBAR'd...  It gets to 99% on files then fails them, its funy.
01:54	<Apeezee>	:(
01:54	<heatfan>	i am having problems connecting to my wireless internet, if i boot with the CD i can log on to my wireless Internet, but if i boot with hard drive i can't connect, can anyone help?
01:54	<SpudDogg>	is there some kind of "main" log file somewhere?
01:54	<tbuss>	haru: doesnt show user/lin/firefox/firefox-bin ?
01:54	<haru>	tbuss, nope
01:54	<localgod11>	ok then i want to put my home directory on another parition how much should i leave for everything else?
01:54	<|box|>	ive got a netgear router lying about on the floor  i could rig my cable modem through the router thinking about it
01:54	<MarcN>	SpudDogg: See /var/log/ for a bunch of different log files.
01:55	<naurd>	SpuddDog : Look in /var/log/message
01:55	<nrdb>	the_darkside_986: you could look in the xorg.conf and see what it says its using.
01:55	<MarcN>	SpudDogg: /var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog and /var/log/daemon.log are usefu.
01:55	<trpr>	Choji: mine went at 160kB/s .. i changed my repos to a local mirror though before i began
01:55	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu and a USB mouse works fine in the same port (and all the others). If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
01:55	<SpudDogg>	MarcN, thanks
01:55	<demon_spork>	|box|, I have a netgear router lying on the floor that I use as a footwarmer when it gets cold
01:55	<vocx>	localgod11, minimum install is 4 GB, but if you are going to install other things, then I suggest 15 or 20 GB.
01:55	<fatgutsy>	anyone else here use xchat-gnome on gutsy and noticed that the menu & program icons do not appear?
01:55	<Choji>	im doing from update manager
01:55	<extrakick>	to get dual screens working agin do i have to edit xorg agin for 7.10
01:55	<localgod11>	i only have 12gb to play with
01:55	<the_darkside_986>	nrdb: well i can't get to that if i boot into default mode but i can see that it uses vesa when i use failsafe graphics, which allow me to use Ctrl+Alt+F# to get to different ttys
01:55	<Apeezee>	Choji: just be happy if it works, a lot of people are having issues with the update
01:55	<|box|>	demon_spork:  ? meaning

02:04	<nrdb>	jcapote: I think (not sure) you need to use tha alternate cd.
02:04	<jcapote>	PAStheLoD: i can do this from the livecd
02:04	<Charlotte>	well if u want to install and use ubuntu yes

02:08	<kitche>	MarcN: correct like I stated
02:08	<kitche>	iobelisk: it's probably a backup partition
02:08	<SpudDogg>	dgr, your best bet is to go to the vmware site and follow the ubuntu instructions
02:09	<dgr>	spuddogg thx

02:09	<eugo>	when browsing folders on a windows partition in linux, special characters are displayed incorrectly (like this: "H\303\241k", not "Hák") how do i fix this?

02:09	<joshjosh>	i have to ask: What's the difference between the 3.4 gig DVD iso and the 700mb desktop iso?
02:09	<vocx>	iobelisk, still, tell us the brand of the PC.
02:09	<ebirtaid>	eugo:  in a terminal or nautilus?
02:09	<|box|>	sudo iptables -L -v ? then create mmy own?
02:10	<iobelisk>	do you think i should just let it for now? i could format it later once ive researched what exactly is in the partition. would it be possible to format this partition later and actually have it merge to my home partition?
02:10	<kitche>	joshjosh: more software packages on the cd probably
02:10	<Jupp2>	drg, I recommend VirtualBox, is much better than vmware
02:10	<drama1981>	dvd has more packages on it.
02:10	<Jupp2>	drg, pm and I can help you
02:10	<crshman>	hi all, my ubuntu install keeps swapping the drive device codes after rebooting.....and my raid5 trips out and dies....any idea why?
02:10	<joshjosh>	Installed automatically or just to use the DVD as a repo?
02:10	<bashveank>	joshjosh: repo
02:10	<plik>	greetings
02:10	<RB2>	SpudDogg: I had a dependency error when trying to install vmware from the repository. I went back yesterday and it was completely removed.
02:10	<eugo>	terminal
02:11	<crshman>	for example /dev/sda would become /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb would become /dev/sdc it's wierd
02:11	<ebirtaid>	eugo: does your terminal emulator support unicode?
02:11	<drama1981>	the extra packages dont get installoed. but if you choose to install something that is on the dvd it will pull it from the dvd instead of having to d/l it
02:11	<joshjosh>	bashveank, Awesome. I already have it installed, but i might grab the DVD iso just so i can install stuff if my connection goes down
02:11	<iobelisk>	is it possible to merge an existing partition to another existing partition while formatting?
02:11	<drama1981>	the dvd doesnt have the full repo on it though. but there are quite a few packages there
02:12	<eugo>	on a windows box i run: scp -r user@bla:/mnt/whatever . and the folders in the windows dir are fucked
02:12	<|box|>	think ill download firestarter
02:12	<vocx>	iobelisk, no. You need to erase one partition and resize the other one to use the unallocated space left by the first one.
02:12	<eugo>	the char's are messed up
02:12	<bashveank>	iobelisk: you can delete one partition and make another one larger, providing they are next to eachother. For real mergin you would need to copy the data manualy
02:12	<ebirtaid>	so you're running windows?
02:12	<iobelisk>	would resizing result in data loss?
02:12	<eugo>	yea on this box
02:12	<monkey_instinct>	how can I do the upgrade with the cd?
02:12	<eugo>	the one that holds the files is a linux
02:13	<eugo>	but the files are on a windows partition
02:13	<bashveank>	iobelisk: Not if you're making it larger
02:13	<dngr>	hi.. does the xgl stuff work on the new livecd?
02:13	<vocx>	iobelisk, the risk is always there. But normally you should have no problem.
02:13	<tamgo>	I am going to ask the question of the day. I'm sure it's been ask tens, if not hundreds of times today, so I apologize in advance. How do I upgrade from the development branch to the stable version of gutsy?

02:13	<jarrod_>	anyone here beat gnuchess on easy?
02:13	<eugo>	windows
02:13	<drama1981>	if you already installed from the 700mb cd. then want to use the dvd as a temp repo you will need to to add it as a repo. sudo apt-cdrom (i believe)
02:13	<ebirtaid>	well then I dont know man ;p
02:13	<ebirtaid>	thats a windows problem
02:13	<vocx>	!bot
02:13	<monkey_instinct>	can I do the upgrade with an ISO file?
02:13	<demon_spork>	where do I get the package "emerald-themes" from gutsy?
02:13	<PurpZeY>	techjim: There should be a setting for that in System
02:13	<vocx>	monkey_instinct, no
02:14	<crshman>	any ideas?
02:14	<kitche>	vocx: the bot is having a hard time tonight :P
02:14	<DShepherd>	drama1981, sudo apt-cdrom add
02:14	<iobelisk>	ok great! thank you! one last question please. is BIOS usually installed on the HDD or on the motherboard itself? reason i ask is i have a manufacturer partition on my drive and im not sure whether its a back up or the BIOS
02:14	<eugo>	i did a ls /mnt/whatever and the filenames are like this: "H\303\241k", not "Hák"
02:14	<ebirtaid>	how are you even executing ls from windows
02:14	<dystopianray>	iobelisk: the mobo itself
02:14	<gnutron>	eugo: /etc/fstab sounds like it's mounting /mnt/Whatever without proper charset support.
02:14	<todkon>	monkey-instinct: run sudo update-manager
02:14	<vocx>	kitche, seems so. Do you know if it has been reported already?
02:14	<LjL>	iobelisk: it's in the motherboard.
02:14	<kitche>	eugo: its a UTF-8 encoding
02:14	<eugo>	and thats in the console, so i might start there
02:14	<flick>	what is the 'super' key?
02:14	<drama1981>	DShepherd yep thats it. thankx for correcting me. ive never had to use it but i knew it was something like that
02:14	<kitche>	vocx: LjL most likely knows it since he had his bot in here for a little bit
02:14	<dystopianray>	flick: the 'windows' or 'apple' key
02:14	<crshman>	the windows key @ flick
02:14	<tamgo>	flick, that would be the "windows" key
02:14	<eugo>	so how do i add my lang to the encoding?
02:14	<tamgo>	I am going to ask the question of the day. I'm sure it's been ask tens, if not hundreds of times today, so I apologize in advance. How do I upgrade from the development branch to the stable version of gutsy?
02:14	<eugo>	aaah
02:15	<DrUnKnMuNkY>	alright well my wireless is obviously sort of working.. it's now autoconnected to a network other than mine but i can't access any sort of wireless configuration screen

02:15	<iobelisk>	cool! after a few months of dual booting now i can go say a permanent goodbye to windows!
02:15	<Jupp2>	monkey_instinct, you should be able to burn the iso and then update
02:15	<dystopianray>	tamgo: sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
02:15	<dngr>	does the xgl stuff work on the new livecd? or does one have to install to hd?
02:15	<Creed>	Is there any plugin or program to have video as wallpaper on Ubuntu? Like DreamScene for Vista...

02:16	<arun__>	is anyone using the chandler app here?
02:17	<vocx>	crshman, I think there is. You need to research on "udev" and some rules for devices.

02:25	<amr>	hello is there any tweaks for gusty
02:25	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	Thanks, Pelo, but that was actually generated by nvidia-xorgconf
02:25	<kitche>	amr: what do you mean tweaks since the same tweaks for feisty should work for gutsy
02:25	<KNY>	in the terminal you can set a transparent background and pre-compiz it would show your desktop background and now it shows any windows behind it
02:25	<KNY>	can that be changed?
02:25	<dgr>	spuddog i downloaded vmware player, now im getting ubuntu ultimate cd appliance, to virtualize windows xp on ubuntu, am i on the right path? or am i about to brake it all? :)

02:36	<Dunas>	Is there a way to fix it? Or to downgrade?
02:36	<IcemanV9>	Dekkard: that's what i am planning to do ... have had always done that way with every release. :)
02:36	<v3ctor>	haven't*

02:36	<RenatoSilva>	v3ctor: soory, can't understand u?

02:37	<RenatoSilva>	v3ctor: which modem is yours?
02:37	<kitche>	Dekkard: it's actually a more vetern move to wait also
02:37	<vocx>	plik, nope. I've never used the alternate install, but I wanted to know if each .deb is accessible.  Maybe wait until you have the CD-ROM since I assume you need to boot from it, not mount it.
02:37	<Dunas>	Pelo, how do I do that? /relative noob

02:37	<Shpook>	from what I understand, Ubuntu has the ability to both disable CPU frequency scaling and run one just one core, correct?
02:38	<kitche>	jordoex: why not just use the semi open source broadcom drivers since the closed source drivers are the ndiswrapper
02:38	<seamus7>	jordoex: go to System/Login Window and change the color there
02:38	<Shpook>	And booting with /noacpi will disable scaling?

02:40	<Pelo>	MajorPoopyPants,  I beleive the   support for lts is 4 years
02:40	<dystopianray>	MajorPoopyPants: in 2010 you can move to 8.04 LTS and have a new kernel
02:40	<Optimus55>	cant update :(
02:40	<MajorPoopyPants>	Hmm
02:40	<rryan>	Shpook : Yes you should be able to. If you don't want to, you can just set it to it's highest setting (no scaling)

02:42	<RenatoSilva>	Can I use APTonCD to make a dist-upgrade??
02:42	<rryan>	Shpook : and as for your question about using only 1 of 2 cores, I don't believe Ubuntu would ever do that unless there was a setting that allowed you to turn SMP off.  I don't know what the setting is, but I bet it exists.
02:42	<Pelo>	RenatoSilva, dist-upgrade should keep your progs and config

02:43	<Pelo>	RenatoSilva,  you can use the alternate install cd to do that , no need to make another one
02:43	<seamus7>	RenatoSilva: no ... a fresh installation ensures a clean install ... many people like to do clean installs for that reason ... if you have your file system in its own partition then fresh installs are much less work

02:46	<regulatethis>	hi
02:46	<vocx>	shinynew_, seems like you are missing GTK libraries?   maybe reinstall "ubuntu-desktop" but seems radical.

02:46	<rryan>	un1x01d ; Yes, I tried TwinView, but it didn't work because my PCI NVIDIA card is too old to use the NVIDIA drivers, they have to use the old ones.. so TwinView can't join that one with the other 2
02:46	<Shpook>	Wow...this room is busy tonight with Gutsy being release....
02:46	<seamus7>	shmoolikipod: is it on the same hard drive as your ubuntu installation?

02:46	<PaulFehr>	pibe86: one minute, let me check
02:46	<shmoolikipod>	yeah, some of them
02:46	<shmoolikipod>	seamus7:
02:46	<logreeval>	seamus7: it says Release 7.10(gutsy)
02:47	<pwnt->	anybody here have used Freeloader before?
02:47	<Pelo>	PaulFehr,  use gparted from the admin menu and make the partitons first
02:47	<rryan>	un1x01d : my xorg.conf : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41149/
02:47	<seamus7>	logreeval: I believe that means you are now using Gutsy Final
02:47	<kevleviathan>	anybody know why the livecd boots to a garbled and distorted screen (laptop with gf go 6150)
02:47	<PaulFehr>	Pelo: The installer partitioner doesn't work well?
02:47	<logreeval>	seamus7: ok cool, if it was a release candidate, do you think it would say?
02:47	<Pelo>	PaulFehr, it usualy does but occasionnaly some ppl have issues,  pre partitionning helps
02:48	<PaulFehr>	Pelo: Ok, I'll try that.
02:48	<jordoex>	Creed: i saw some vids on youtube... apparently they used xwinwrap; it's possible, but i dunno
02:48	<Xanthus>	kevleviathan: did you try the video safe boot option?
02:48	<vocx>	shinynew_, too much trouble I presume. Install gtk-base or something like that. What did you do that caused that error message?
02:48	<pwnt->	Hello
02:48	<seamus7>	logreeval: I believe so ... but I've read in a number of places that all the updates over the last couple days have brought RC to the final release ... they are one and the same
02:48	<kevleviathan>	Xanthus: no I didn't, but I've had this problem with 7.04 as well
02:48	<plik>	hi pwnt-
02:48	<newbie1>	DOES anyone know if the latest kernel version 2.6.22-14-generic breaks the INTELHDA sound card? is there a fix coming?
02:48	<Pelo>	PaulFehr, also , you can only have 4 primary partitions on any hdd, you might have to make new ones as logical

02:48	<kevleviathan>	Xanthus: I can get it to install if I use that option, but when it boots up after that its the same thing over again
02:48	<rryan>	un1x01d : If both your NVIDIA cards are new enough for nvidia drivers, you should try using TwinView to merge them. It's faster than Xinerama.
02:48	<logreeval>	seamus7: ok, cool, thanks for the help :)
02:48	<un1x01d>	i have 2 x Nvida Pci-e and i have 2 monitors on 1 and another one on the other i can't get neither xinerama or twinview working

03:01	<amr>	Xanthus plz how to make gusty boot faster
03:01	<pazsion>	gnight pelo
03:01	<Lanken>	happy release! I had gutsy beta installed (it worked better for my newish laptop).  Do I just wait for the fracas to subside and update as usual?
03:01	<Shpook>	ouch
03:01	<ruz322>	sounds like u have problems
03:01	<Powerking89670>	mrj: yea, try dragging the bars, thats what made mine stay :D
03:01	<RenatoSilva>	Pelo: but not the software
03:01	<juanbond>	I am trying to enable my ATI restricted driver and when I hit the enable checkbox it tells me "Fix broken packages first".  What can I do to install my restricted driver?
03:01	<mrj>	lol
03:01	<DIguana>	Is there any way of getting a configuration screen of some sort for the "Visual Effects" in 7.10? I know Beryl had a fairly intuitive graphical preferences app and I'd like to be able to customise the 3D effects beyond simply turning them on or off in the "Appearance Preferences" screen.
03:01	<Xanthus>	mouka: System->Administration->Users and Groups
03:01	<vocx>	Lanken, yes
03:01	<v3ctor>	mouka: sudo usermod -G cdrec <user>
03:01	<IcemanV9>	Lanken: good plan
03:01	<cafuego>	amr: Buy faster hardware
03:01	<crdlb>	!ccsm | DIguana
03:01	<ubotu>	DIguana: To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz
03:01	<Charlotte>	any one?
03:01	<mrj>	I can't mount my NTFS partitions anymore either, something always breaks when I reboot

03:01	<Crozar>	the_darkside_986: just install it if you want to use XGL , but through live cd you cant unless you want to go a long hardway for it to work , and google it :)
03:01	<spezticle>	lol well i don't get  an IP... theres 2 available wireless networks. one not mine and encrypted, it will try and connect to that one, but can't cos  i dont have the key, but when i try to connect to my own, it just waits a few minutes... and stops
03:01	<jdong>	v3ctor: whoa, don't you need -a?
03:01	<Shpook>	did you change the file's in the font folders?
03:01	<pazsion>	can i run ubuntu in a command based thing or tell it to install to harddrive during boot?
03:01	<Dunas>	Is there some way to downgrade from 7.10 back to 7.04? :x
03:01	<crdlb>	!downgrade
03:02	<ubotu>	Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
03:02	<amr>	i am having a new laptop 1.8 core duo with 1 gig of ram
03:02	<v3ctor>	jdong: why would i need -a?
03:02	<WorkingOnWise>	I keep getting an error when I try to install anything with Synaptics. It says a package failed to install.
03:02	<cafuego>	Dunas: Nope, fresh install.
03:02	<jdong>	v3ctor: to append the user to the group, rather than setting the user to only that group?
03:02	<Dunas>	cafuego, thanks. Bah. Oh well.
03:02	<seamus7>	Dunas: do a fresh install using the 7.04 iso
03:02	<Crozar>	WorkingOnWise: what error?
03:02	<amr>	Xanthus on that hardware gusty is slow in boot
03:02	<jdong>	v3ctor: or am I recalling a BSD-ism?
03:02	<mrj>	WorkingOnWise, the error might help
03:02	<vocx>	Charlotte, you are not asking a question. Besides that seems like a borked drive. Do not repeat, better to paste the error. You can run "fsck" on unmonted drives only.
03:02	<v3ctor>	ahh..sorry, linux usermod seems to bo silly
03:02	<amr>	xanthus i am having a new laptop 1.8 core duo with 1 gig of ram
03:02	<v3ctor>	jdong: you are correct
03:02	<IcemanV9>	spezticle: same here ... it takes me a min or so to connect to my wifi encrypted network (wpa2)
03:02	<v3ctor>	mouka: sudo usermod -a -G cdrec <user>
03:03	<Xanthus>	amr: you were using Feisty before Gutsy?
03:03	<jdong>	v3ctor: I only learn from those kinds of mistakes the hard way... multiple times :D
03:03	<the_darkside_986>	this is so irritating. i think i will just reinstall openSUSE 10.3 until we decide to make a REAL ubuntu release that does not depend on proprietary drivers that cannot be included...
03:03	<v3ctor>	jdong: bsd-ism would not require the -a
03:03	<Charlotte>	broken :( it is brend new only a couple of mounts
03:03	<Dunas>	'cause Synaptic's not able to download ANYTHING right now, and Firefox, which was fine on 7.04, keeps dying on me in 7.10... so off to fresh-install.
03:03	<Crozar>	WorkingOnWise error installing gutsy , recheck md5sum , check if they match , write at low speeds people , and pray your drive is not dead.
03:03	<DIguana>	ubotu: Thanks. If any Ubuntu-devs are reading this, it'd be nice to have that installed by default.
03:03	<mrj>	the_darkside_986, sniffle
03:03	<ruz322>	Charlotte, when you ran fsck, did you run it while logged into thesystem or from a recovery disc..
03:03	<emeriste>	how do you run pididentd?
03:03	<amr_>	yes but fesity was slower
03:03	<pazsion>	::wants to install to HD, GUI is really slow:::can i tell it to install to HD during bootup?

03:03	<v3ctor>	jdong: i'm a long time solaris guy, some of those minor differences get lost
03:03	<Cryoniq>	dystopianray: hmm.. changed it to readon in screen and graphics, then restarted xorg.. and it was still on vesa.. hmm..
03:03	<plik>	the_darkside_986:  are you gonna say anything constructive, or just bitch all night?
03:03	<Charlotte>	i m logon right now
03:03	<Xanthus>	amr_: fresh install or upgraded?
03:03	<Cryoniq>	dystopianray: refused to change it seemed.. lol
03:03	<the_darkside_986>	wait though... how did you other Nvidia ppl have a functional liveCD if that depends on nvidia-glx? i'm confused now
03:03	<vocx>	Charlotte, maybe there is a way to fix it with "fdisk" but I don't know for sure,
03:04	<DIguana>	Hmmm... I guess I should've directed my thanks toward crdlb.
03:04	<amr_>	xanthus , i am having fujitsu seimens amilo pi 1505
03:04	<mrj>	Dunas, there's a pretty logical and obvious reason you can't download from synaptic right now.
03:04	<Cryoniq>	dystopianray: radeon i meant
03:04	<amr_>	fresh
03:04	<the_darkside_986>	i'm sorry i love ubuntu but i get depressed when i can't get an OS installed.
03:04	<crdlb>	DIguana, indeed :)
03:04	<ruz322>	Charlotte, you should log off, boot from the recovery disk, and go from there
03:04	<Kanti>	Is anyone else having problems installing/updating your system?  http://archive.ubuntu.com seems to be unreachable
03:04	<jdong>	v3ctor: ah, cool :) -- I just wanted to make sure nobody's default groupslist accidentally gets zapped... since in Ubuntu that's NASTY and will lock you out of root without recovery mode!
03:04	<Shpook>	Ooh, is there a debugging mode that will log every single little system action, besides the logs in /var/logs?
03:04	<Kanti>	(as are others)
03:04	<pazsion>	is the dark side also "D-SIDE""??
03:04	<vocx>	Kanti, read topic
03:04	<Pici>	Kanti: yes, its very slow
03:04	<Charlotte>	ok
03:04	<dystopianray>	Cryoniq: change it manually
03:04	<plik>	Kanti: lots of torrents at http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/
03:04	<amr_>	xanthus , i am having vista on dual boot but vista is faster
03:04	<mrj>	the_darkside_986, use whatever distro works best for you
03:04	<ruz322>	Charlotte, read up on chroot first, you will need to do that to get access to the file system
03:04	<Kanti>	oh damn, sorry (i shoulda known to check that)
03:04	<v3ctor>	jdong: thanks for looking out ;)
03:04	<Cryoniq>	dystopianray: driver "radeon" in xorg.conf u mean? :)
03:04	<vocx>	Kanti, naturally
03:05	<the_darkside_986>	i'm just joking anyway i hate openSUSE. but ppl on the newer nvidia cards... what did the default xorg.conf say?
03:05	<amr_>	xanthus , vista is booting faster and more responsive
03:05	<toxidas>	i've just fresh installed gutsy but it boots up too slow:(((( anybody help me pls??
03:05	<Dunas>	mrj, huh? It's not just Synaptic, Firefox keeps freezing temporarily at times on its own and the file system is giving me problems trying to find a specific file (the flash files, which I was told to uninstall/reinstall)
03:05	<dystopianray>	Cryoniq: yes
03:05	<pinion>	upgrade to gutsy has hosed my system.  tzdata didn't upgrade properly and it messed up some other stuff.  I removed it, reinstalled.  None of the other stuff will update though.  tried to upgrade again but I'm already running 7.10  I think I'm just going to wipe because I've only been running ubuntu for a few weeks.  How can I save my virtual machine in vmware so that it will use it once I reinstall?  Or should I just reinstall xp and VB
03:05	<pinion>	 2005 since that's what I need it for?  please pm
03:05	<pazsion>	the darkside 986---are you also "D-SIDE"
03:05	<Cryoniq>	dystopianray: and also change those with glx to aiglx?
03:05	<Charlotte>	what do u mean chrot list??
03:05]  * Xanthus is seeing a lot of slow boot complaints....
03:05	<haru>	someone help me fix my gutsy, when it loads instead of that progress bar thingy, my screen blinks till it comes to GDM
03:05	<dystopianray>	Cryoniq: only change the driver from vesa to radeon
03:05	<gordboy>	found a fix for dolphin (7.10) that allows bookmarks to be saved : chown -R username:username ~/.kde/ some of the folders are mistakenly owned by root. the recursive chown fixes that. woohoo
03:05	<WorkingOnWise>	mrj when I do "sudo dpkg --configure -a" I get "dpkg: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 1:   field name"
03:05	<Crozar>	toxidas: maybe you installed the wrong match for your system , which file you downloaded? alternate or pc x86 or the amd version?
03:05	<the_darkside_986>	pazsion: i have no other alias besides my current one
03:05	<Cryoniq>	dystopianray: kk =)
03:05	<strabes>	in gutsy, when i quit rhythmbox & it's paused, it plays like .5 seconds of the last song that I was playing. is anyone else experiencing this?
03:05	<mrj>	Dunas, i was only commenting on not being able to download from synaptic
03:05	<pavan>	all.. i have been using gutsy from when it was in RC1 (i think) and usually i see a standard stream of updates almost everyday.. today after the official release.. i just don't see any software updates..
03:06	<Powerking89670>	night all
03:06	<Dunas>	mrj, is there an alternative to Synaptic right now?
03:06	<Crozar>	pavan: i have been trying to update since 11 hours
03:06	<mrj>	pavan, you're like the 50th person to say that, so I'm going to assume there just arent any updates posted for the beta/rc's yet
03:06	<vocx>	pavan, maybe you upgraded to the final release without knowing.
03:06	<mrj>	Dunas, nope
03:06	<plik>	Dunas: aptitude ?  ;)
03:06	<m1r>	evening all
03:06	<Evanlec>	pavan, thats because the servers are jammed right now
03:06	<mrj>	Dunas, there are apt mirrors
03:06	<ccaic>	哇
03:06	<pazsion>	darkside-- good =) i'd have to frag you D-SIDE is a person in #linux on underground that's been a real D =)
03:06	<Evanlec>	pavan, im experiencing same thing
03:06	<strabes>	Dunas: apt-get or aptitude
03:06	<mrj>	Dunas, most of us are just waiting
03:06	<amr_>	xanthus, i saw many people on ubuntu forums having the same issue , is that a bug
03:06	<Crozar>	pavan: the server updates are closed temporary reasons lets wait for that huh
03:07	<mrj>	No, he wants mirrors for apt/aptitude, not command alternatives
03:07	<arun__>	um.. my right click is too sensitive.. every time i right click it just automatically selects the first option from the right click menu.. for example, if i right click on the desktop, it just creates a new folder. it's a bit irritating, which part of the mouse settings do i tweak?
03:07	<pavan>	thx guys.... makes sense..
03:07	<gordboy>	pavan: kdelibs need fixing for kopete. there is a fixed up package, and it should be in gutsy-proposed before too long ...
03:07	<plik>	mrj: ooops, sorry  :)
03:07	<Xanthus>	WorkingOnWise: do a "sudo apt-get update", maybe it refresh the available file
03:07	<strabes>	like alternate sources? Try changing them to the country nearest you
03:07	<cdm10>	Yay, reinstalling fixed my Gutsy Beta woes, even though updates should have taken care of them.
03:07	<plik>	I'm seeding the alternative install torrent  :)
03:07	<MerrickB>	Where does BasKet hide the icons that it uses when the program is minimized to the Panel?  I had changed it months ago, but when I upgraded to Gutsy, it restored the default icon back to that wretched easter-basket looking icon.
03:07	<alienseer23>	when i try to upgrade (gksu "update-manager -c"), using the cd rom or server as repo source, i tell it to install, agree to the install, the upgrade gui freezes up before it loads and hangs indeffinately. Is this fixable? is there an alternate command line upgrade wit no gui?
03:07	<mrj>	Dunas, I've just been apt getting tiny stuff all night, I tried to apt-get a 40mb file and cancelled it quickly
03:07	<cdm10>	strabes: there's a "choose best mirror" option that works great.
03:07	<the_darkside_986>	i have a question for nvidia users... does the livecd actually boot up and say that it is already using restricted nvidia drivers?
03:07	<WorkingOnWise>	Xanthus: ok.
03:07	<cdm10>	mrj: go to System>Admin>Software Sources
03:07	<Shpook>	Just as a curious question, is anyone else experiening freezing problems since they upgraded?
03:08	<the_darkside_986>	or are the restricted nvidia drivers dl'd after install?
03:08	<mrj>	cdm10, I know I can add mirrors, etc
03:08	<Shpook>	experiencing*
03:08	<cdm10>	the_darkside_986: no, that seems impossible... the livecd doesn't have the drivers on them.
03:08	<pazsion>	darkside---i have 5500 loaded..restricted drivers...
03:08	<cdm10>	the_darkside_986: after install
03:08	<Xanthus>	amr_: I'm not aware of it but i'm worrying about so many "slow boot" messages
03:08	<Dunas>	Out of curiosity, is there an easy way to search my entire system for files related to Flash? I think that's the reason Firefox/Swiftweasel keep freezing on me.
03:08	<strabes>	in gutsy, when i quit rhythmbox & it's paused, it plays like .5 seconds of the last song that I was playing. is anyone else experiencing this?
03:08	<Evanlec>	the_darkside_986, the latter
03:08	<gordboy>	i upgraded from feisty to gutsy with hardly a hitch. all fully operational now, and some nice new apps
03:08	<mrj>	Dunas, locate maybe
03:08	<mrj>	Dunas, obviously grep would go through the files but take forever
03:08	<DIguana>	Does anyone know what "<Super>" is bound to on a standard 104-key PC keyboard?
03:08	<pazsion>	darkside-- worked in live cd and after HD install
03:08	<vocx>	the_darkside_986, I don't think the Ubuntu CD includes restricted stuff. You normally install, select the other repositories and then install restricted stuff.
03:08	<cdm10>	mrj: if you go there, and choose Other, there's an option to find best server, it works great.
03:08	<toxidas>	Xanthus: amr_: do you have an idea why is that happening?
03:08	<cdm10>	DIguana: windows key
03:08	<mrj>	cdm10, cool will do
03:08	<Evanlec>	strabes, no, but is it really a big problem?
03:08	<Shpook>	windows key diguana
03:09	<the_darkside_986>	ok... so how did your xserver work? just automatically without any issues via "nv"
03:09	<cdm10>	the_darkside_986: yup
03:09	<amr>	xanthus , i might have a hint for you , slow boot is in the last part after the progress bar and from typing passsword to a ready to use desktop
03:09	<MajorPoopyPants>	how does ubuntu compare to debian?
03:09	<strabes>	Evanlec: it's kind of annoying. i'd simply like to know if anyone else is experiencing it or if it's just my computer
03:09	<Dunas>	...ok, and how would I go about uninstalling Flash plugin? :X
=== w4ett_ is now known as w4ett
03:09	<cdm10>	the_darkside_986: if you've been having problems, have you tried booting in safe graphics?
03:09	<cdm10>	MajorPoopyPants: It's easier to use for non-geeks.
03:09	<Evanlec>	strabes, ive not heard of such a thing no
03:09	<Xanthus>	Dunas: search the following directories: /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins, /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins and /home/user/.mozilla/plugins
03:09	<sx66xfce>	what up
03:09	<strabes>	Evanlec: can you try it?
03:09	<DIguana>	Thanks cdm10 and Shpook.
03:09	<vocx>	MajorPoopyPants, this is not a place to discuss that. Head to #ubuntu-offtopic
03:09	<pazsion>	darkside-5500 restriced is not enabled...enabling now..
03:09	<gordboy>	the_darkside_986: i take it you mean me :) i use radeon driver. no probs whatsoever
03:09	<the_darkside_986>	cdm10: i've tried failsafe graphics mode but it does the same thing. blank screen in an attempt to use the "nv" OR the "vesa" drivers
03:09	<Shpook>	No problem :-)
03:10	<vocx>	!debian >	MajorPoopyPants
03:10	<strabes>	Evanlec: pause your music in rhythmbox, then quit rhythmbox
03:10	<Evanlec>	strabes, i dont use rhythmbox currently, just use nautilus and totem ;p
03:10	<MajorPoopyPants>	?? im trying to decide whether to migrate from debian or now
03:10	<strabes>	Evanlec: oh, ok
03:10	<amr>	xanthus , i tried disabling many processes but no speed gain but what maked boot realy fast is disabling compiz
03:10	<Xanthus>	Dunas: delete the files flashplayer.xpt and  libflashplayer.so files when you find them
03:10	<MajorPoopyPants>	hey thanks for the bot links
03:10	<arun__>	anyone about the mouse problem?
03:10	<fiveiron>	anyone have probs with gutsy booting REALLY slowly on a laptop?
03:10	<amr>	if i disable compiz - ubuntu boots faster
03:10	<cdm10>	I don't think Debian is ot here...
03:10	<cdm10>	Actually, it is.
03:10	<Xanthus>	amr: hmm... compiz
03:10	<amr>	but the progress bar is still slow
03:10	<cdm10>	But, comparing it to Ubuntu is not.
03:10	<mrj>	my gutsy boots a LOT faster now than it did in beta
03:10	<MajorPoopyPants>	IRC rocks
03:10	<Evanlec>	MajorPoopyPants, if u want to get in on all the fun then go for it ;)
03:10	<the_darkside_986>	i am tempted to plug my monitor back into my old ATI X200 just to boot gutsy. i can't wait 'til nouveau pwnz nvidia for all this trouble they're causing me tonight
03:10	<kevleviathan>	Xanathus: any other ideas on the laptop with 6150 getting a corrupted screen?
03:10	<strabes>	fiveiron: in grub, remove the "splash" boot parameter and write down where it's freezing for a long time?
03:11	<vocx>	MajorPoopyPants, I mean we shouldn't discuss "which is better" in here, since that may complicate things. Glad I could help.
03:11	<WorkingOnWise>	Xanthus: ran apt-get update. went errorfree. same errors with dpkg.
03:11	<Shpook>	are there any changes between the release canidate and the final release?
03:11	<cdm10>	vocx: he didn't ask which is better, he asked what's different.
03:11	<fiveiron>	strabes, actuall thats it... i'm not seeing a spash boot... i just now realized that
03:11	<Dunas>	Aha, there they are.
03:11	<MajorPoopyPants>	vocx, im not asking which is better - im asking how they compare
03:11	<Ward1983>	is there a update guide somewhere?
03:11	<amr>	xanthus , compiz slows the boot process after system is up but before that it's slower than xp or even vista
03:11	<pazsion>	:::anyone who cares:: d/ling and installing restricted nvidia drivers..
03:11	<the_darkside_986>	i got a question... once you install gutsy, can you turn off the aiglx stuff and boot a normal x server afterwards that doesn't require any thing fancy?
03:11	<strabes>	Shpook: nothing significant that i know of. There were very few updates in the two days between the RC and the actual release
03:11	<toxidas>	amr: xanthus and i also can't see the bootsplash screen before login
03:11	<Ward1983>	guide / howto
03:11	<cdm10>	Ward1983: go to System>Admin>Update Manager and hit Check
03:11	<MajorPoopyPants>	Better is too subjective a term to use in a distro choice
03:11	<sonta>	i just wanted to say thanks
03:11	<eb_>	anyone having priblems with the upgrade from 7.04 7.10?  can't seem to find packages on the server?
03:11	<strabes>	fiveiron: then where is it freezing?
03:11	<cdm10>	Ward1983: but I'd wait a few days, until the servers speed up.
03:12	<vocx>	cdm10, MajorPoopyPants I understand. But then again, you never know what people ask. So no problems.
03:12	<Ward1983>	cdm10, and should not all my applications keep working, can i go easily back?
03:12	<MajorPoopyPants>	vocx, no problemo - not trying to cause issues
03:12	<fiveiron>	strabes, not sure... will try the non-graphical boot and see if maybe i'm just impatient...
03:12	<fiveiron>	:-)
03:12	<Evanlec>	MajorPoopyPants, im sure sure there are many differences...
03:12	<TinyGrasshopper>	Hello, I have an nvidia card (7600) and I'm getting random restarts with Desktop effects enabled, which i don't see without desktop effects. I tried to see what would happen if I disabled the proprietary drivers and tried turning on compiz then. When I restarted it didn't seem to set the right resolution (widescreen monitor) so I don't get a screen, the monitor just says 'Out of Range'. How do I either change the resolution in
03:12	<TinyGrasshopper>	command line or more preferably turn the proprietary drivers back on in command line?
03:12	<Shpook>	strabes: cool, i wasn't sure if i didn't get an update because of overloaded servers or not
03:12	<Xanthus>	WorkingOnWise: try sudo apt-get check
03:12	<cdm10>	Ward1983: No, you'll have to reinstall.
03:12	<Ward1983>	cdm10, all of my software?
03:12	<guru>	is there a problem with archive.ubuntu.com or is it just my connection?
03:12	<fkumro>	what can I remove if i dont plan on using the desktop effects
03:13	<amr>	toxidas : i can see it but a horizontal line is there when i boot from hypernate and system boot very very slow when i boot from hypernate or when powerfailure
03:13	<Evanlec>	MajorPoopyPants, probly major similarity is the .deb package system, otherwise i dunno
03:13	<the_darkside_986>	i have an idea... ubuntu gutsy should have had the nouveau drivers so at least the liveCD would work just enough so i can install and get the real nvidia drivers...
03:13	<fiveiron>	fkumro, compiz*
03:13	<cdm10>	fkumro: don't remove anything, just disable 'em... they don't take up much space.
03:13	<strabes>	Shpook: nah, if your sources download then it will tell you if there are upgrades. just run "sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade"
03:13	<Xanthus>	amr: maybe your graphic card is not well supported by compiz...
03:13	<vocx>	guru, read the topic
03:13	<samiloop>	haha The upgrade aborts now. Your system could be in an unusable state. A recovery will run now (dpkg --configure -a).
03:13	<WorkingOnWise>	Xanthus: ran with no errors. same dpkg errors.
03:13	<cdm10>	Ward1983: if stuff breaks during the upgrade, you may be able to fix it by asking here. Otherwise, you may need to reinstall Ubuntu.
03:13	<jazz632>	hmm so i'm trying to do a clean install of ubuntu, but my internal cd rom drive is busted and im trying to install from an external (but i cant boot from it). any idea on what i can do?
03:13	<dystopianray>	the_darkside_986: vesa or nv should still work
03:13	<alienseer23>	i can't get pas the "distrobution upgrade" gui, it freezes on load. Fix?

03:14	<jazz632>	hah yeah its a laptop though so its harder to get one that works
03:14	<gordboy>	the_darkside_986: yes you can. edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add - Option "AIGLX" "off" - to the ServerFlags section. also add - Option "Composite" "disable" - to the Extensions section

03:16	<mrj>	juanbond, run the command it tells you to run when it says theres a broken package. it should be something like sudo apt-get install -f
03:16	<pazsion>	i must be typing to much to fast
03:16	<WorkingOnWise>	Xanthus: synaptic add the following to the dpkg error. "A package failed to install. Trying to recover:  "

03:17	<gordboy>	well my gutsy system is going full steam ahead now. so, so long suckers !
03:17	<WorkingOnWise>	add=adds
03:17	<Ward1983>	can i just keep running my apps while upgrading?
03:17	<riotkittie>	yay. i  made the mistake of trying to boot into windows.  then i booted into gutsy to discover my wireless adapter wont come on at all :|
03:17	<mrj>	Ward1983, i'd recommend not
03:17	<iobelisk>	i am currently partitioning my drive. i have 1.5 gigs for swap, 20 gigs for root, i have available about 58 gigs left. the majority of this would be /home but i also want to leave aside perhaps 10-15 gigs for other distro installations. i will surely want to install and run desktop bsd soon for example. so my question is what mount point can i give this last partition?
03:17	<caner>	<mrj>	how can i fix that refresh rate inconsistency?
03:17	<kahrytan>	Evanlec, That doesnt exit in gutsy. It's Appearance>Fonts now

03:17	<mrthereverend>	yah, i know
03:18	<jovi>	anybody in China here?
03:18	<juanbond>	mrj, when I do sudo apt-get install -f,  it's not telling me anything about broken packages.  it says 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
03:18	<mumrah>	any news on the repository servers being down? i'm having trouble grabbing any packages
03:18	<Evanlec>	kahrytan, yea, right i forgot, did u check that?
03:18	<mrj>	Ward1983, if you have mission critical applications, upgrading to a new version fo ubuntu on day 1 is probably not a good idea
03:18	<Optimus56>	where can i go to see a list of all the upgrades/changes in gusty?
03:18	<kevleviathan>	so does anybody else have an idea on how to fix video corruption when booting livecd?
03:18	<caner>	<mrj>	i know but its fixed at 50hz. a laptop
03:18	<darkguy>	hey guys, I'm installing gutsy and I'm having a small dilemma here - I want to use XFS for the whole system, but it says GRUB is gonna throw an error when installing and that it'll install LILO. Is this good? what can I do in this case? I want XFS or something faster than ext3...
03:18	<ale[x]>	i'm trying to do a preseed install, anyone know how I can skip cdrom detection?
03:18	<iamnotbrucewayne>	i'm looking for MD5SUMs, anyone got a link to them for the DVD isos?
03:18	<pwnguin>	How do i take a screenshot of just a window?
03:18	<avarner>	mrthereverend: for mine, i could use my touchpad but it didn't work so well with my driver so i had to install another drive that was labled something similar to synaptics
03:18	<Ward1983>	mrj, how long would you recommend waiting?
03:18	<kahrytan>	Evanlec, I changed it to more appealing font. Verdana. But now webpage text is tiny. It didnt happen in feisty
03:18	<vocx>	iobelisk, don't know, maybe just /Other/BSD  not really important since the mount point can be changed later.
03:18	<IcemanV9>	mumrah: try your closest neighbor countries' repo server
03:18	<iobelisk>	actually i don't think there is anything wrong with upgrading to gutsy on day 1. i have been using the beta version since the day it came out and ive been very good.
03:18	<avarner>	mrthereverend: xfree86-driver-synaptics made my touchpad work best
03:18	<mrj>	caner, 50 shouldnt be bad what kind of laptop
03:19	<Evanlec>	darkguy, from what i hear ext3 is just as fast once its properly tuned
03:19	<pwnguin>	darkguy: what do you use the FS for?
03:19	<mumrah>	icemanv9: where can i grab a sources file like that?
03:19	<mrthereverend>	how do i install
03:19	<Evanlec>	kahrytan, if u change it back are the fonts normal?
03:19	<dogmaster>	Have just downloaded GG 7.10 for server and plan to install it on a Shuttle PC (now running windows XP/NTFS) that I use to host Slimdevices Slimserver and PLone 3.02.   I'd looking for suggestions on the file system to choose and use for these applications when I install 7.10.  Does anyone have any experience using Reiser 3 or 4 with Ubuntu?  After ZFS, Reiser looks like the slickest file system out there.
03:19	<iobelisk>	vocx: oh. you mean i can create my own mount points? wow, i did not know that!
03:19	<mrj>	Ward1983, i'm a systems engineer, i dont upgrade mission critical appliances unless they're broken
03:19	<avarner>	well i installed mine in ubuntu using the synaptic package manager
03:19	<kahrytan>	Evanlec, I tried multiple others. they are still tiny
03:19	<mrthereverend>	k, thanx
03:19	<xsacha>	darkguy: i find reiser is actually faster than ext3 and xfs is about the same as ext3
03:19	<mrj>	thats your decision
03:19	<whonicca>	how do i make sure i installed the final version and not a rc1 or something
03:19	<vocx>	iobelisk, of course you an create whatever mount point you wish, it is your system you know. You own it.
03:19	<caner>	<mrj>	hp pavillon dv6000. can the problem be with nvidia and vsync? somebody talked about that today?
03:19	<cafuego>	whonicca: dist-upgrade when done
03:20	<Evanlec>	has anyone actually used reiser4 yet?
03:20	<Ward1983>	mrj, well i just have some application i would like to keep using, i don't have a server or anything
03:20	<darkguy>	Evanlec: do you know where can I find info to do so? - pwnguin: my main pc actually, but I do a lot of stuff HD-wise, I'm just kinda annoyed that the HD just starts doing a lot of stuff just to load some simple app in Feisty, so I'm using the chance to repartition with something better.
03:20	<mrj>	whonicca, dist-upgrade
03:20	<IcemanV9>	mumrah: just modify your sources.list; for example change 'us' to 'ca' or 'mx' ... something likes that
03:20	<dansku>	help, just installed ubuntu 7.10, but now my apt-get doent work

03:20	<xsacha>	riotkittie: it has drivers?
03:20	<whonicca>	on gusty
03:20	<darkcrab>	does anyone know why turning on desktop effects would make your system slight unstable, like firefox crashing more and games acting slightly wierd.
03:20	<juanbond>	mrj, when I do sudo apt-get install -f,  it's not telling me anything about broken packages.  it says 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
03:21	<pwnguin>	darkguy: well you dont want XFS for that. really, look into tuning ext3. reiser takes 30 seconds to mount on large systems, and XFS will lose your data on improper shutdowns
03:21	<caner>	<mrj>	o.k thank. i will ask it to google
03:21	<mrj>	Ward1983, if youre feeling gutsy, try it, obviously noone can guarantee your applications will work
03:21	<iamnotbrucewayne>	are there any MD5SUMs for the DVD isos?
03:21	<vocx>	darkcrab, because desktop effects are not precisely stable.
03:21	<toxidas>	no solution for slow boot-up yet ??? i wonder how many of you have the slow boot problem
03:21	<logreeval>	Hi, i dont have any sound on my gutsy machine, can someone help me get some sound on this?
03:21	<amr>	dogmaster, reiser is only fast when you copy files only but system response is not
03:21	<mrj>	juanbond, the last few lines of the command don't say anything about broken?
03:21	<Evanlec>	whonicca, mine is not working out of the box, this may have been intentional, personally i found that feature irritating
03:21	<riotkittie>	xsacha >	i'm using ndiswrapper and it's been working fine for well over a month. i tried booting into windows, and when i rebooted into ubuntu...  it was just dead

03:22	<darkcrab>	I have a question, is the ext3 mac file system the same as the ext3 linux file system?

03:22	<dogmaster>	amr, which version of Reiser did you use? 3 or 4?
03:22	<fatbrain>	mrj: Test on the CD also begins with "loading kernel" which get stuck at 65%
03:22	<Evanlec>	amr, oh, so sorta inbetween huh? lol
03:22	<pwnguin>	is there a GNOME tool to screenshot a single window instead of the full screen?
03:23	<amr>	dogmaster 3

03:23	<vocx>	iamnotbrucewayne, are you sure there aren't any???
03:23	<mrj>	fatbrain, i'd reburn it at a much lower speed
03:23	<whonicca>	pwnguin, good question

03:23	<dansku>	anyone have any idea why my apt-get isnt workinh?
03:23	<amr>	evanlec , no the latest version of reiser 3 is 3.6
03:23	<mrj>	dansku, whats the error
03:23	<iamnotbrucewayne>	vocx, i didn't see any yet (i just did a google search and looking at the mailing lists)

03:24	<dansku>	mrj it doesnt find anything,
03:24	<Jonfish>	or do you need a whole different installation?
03:24	<kahrytan>	Can someone help me fix the fonts on my gutsy system? I did something to cause text on pages to be small. And it's not firefox related.  (http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o200/kahrytan/snapshot1.png)
03:24	<cafuego>	darkguy: Did you want to get banned?
03:24	<Raineer>	bruce: the DVD that is
03:24	<IcemanV9>	kahrytan: restart the browser?
03:24	<pwnguin>	darkguy: PERFECT
03:24	<darkcrab>	wouldnt you just install kubuntu jonfish?
03:24	<WorkingOnWise>	when I try to install anything using Synaptic, I get the following error, then nothing, and no packages will install.: dpkg: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 1:
03:24	<WorkingOnWise>	 field name `
03:24	<WorkingOnWise>	E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (2)  A package failed to install. Trying to recover:
03:24	<darkguy>	cafuego: huh?
03:24	<Jonfish>	Well I already install ubuntu
03:24	<darkguy>	pwnguin: :D
03:24	<Jonfish>	is there a way to install KDE?
03:24	<cafuego>	darkguy: Don't suggest people hit alt+print screen.
03:24	<mrj>	Ward1983, my question is why even use linux if you don't expect to have the fun of breaking it and fixing it
03:24	<tonyyarusso>	!kde | Jonfish
03:24	<ubotu>	Jonfish: KDE (http://kde.org) is the !desktop environment used natively in !Kubuntu. To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop », or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE . Latest KDE version is 3.5.8 for Gusty and Feisty, 3.5.6 for Edgy, and 3.5.5 for Dapper. See http://kubuntu.org for more information.
03:24	<iamnotbrucewayne>	they hide the DVD isos pretty good to begin with :P
03:24	<toxidas>	crazy_bus: i also have the same problem just freezes
03:24	<KaiForce>	what's the word on the street - does the gibbon rule or what?
03:24	<Jonfish>	thx ubotu
03:24	<darkcrab>	well yea jonfish.
03:25	<Raineer>	jon: you can sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
03:25	<v3ctor>	Jonfish: sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop
03:25	<black_13>	how does splash work??
03:25	<Jonfish>	excellent thanks
03:25	<mrj>	dansku, what do you mean it doesnt find anything, you do a search and its empty?
03:25	<haru>	someone help me fix my gutsy, when it loads instead of that progress bar thingy, my screen blinks till it comes to GDM
03:25	<darkguy>	cafuego: why not? it's in the hotkeys preference window o.O
03:25	<cafuego>	darkguy: it's the magic sysrq key combo, which allows for instant rebooting and other special stuff
03:25	<mrj>	dansku, or it cant find a download source?
=== vmlinuz- is now known as pwnt-
03:25	<haru>	i.e. uspash never comes
03:25	<Ward1983>	mrj, i don't have the experience to fix things fast enough, it can take me days
03:25	<amr>	evanlec , i can only see performance when i copy files , many small files only reiser is superior but other than this ext3 is the same but realy more supported and if you use laptop ext3 is better as it uses less cpu than reiser3 or 4
03:25	<mrj>	Ward1983, best way to learn then
03:25	<piripak>	i downloaded gutsy through torrent but moved from folder. how can i share it again?(i have both rtorrent and azureus)
03:25	<mw-home>	apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade is all I need to do, after editing my sources.list, right?
03:25	<crazy_bus>	toxidas: have you found anything to fix the problem?
03:25	<fatbrain>	mrj: I read something on the core 2 duo support page "APIC turned on in BIOS freezes system during boot" I'll try turn that off and see if it helps :) thanks for help all
03:25	<Sgt_Shankers>	anyone know why i cant install new apps using add/remove?
03:25	<Ward1983>	mrj, i'm kindof depending on this system
03:25	<haru>	black_13, u arent seeing the usplash either?
03:25	<kahrytan>	IcemanV9, I told you it's not firefox related.
03:26	<dansku>	i like, type "apt-get install vnc" it says it doesnt find  vnc
03:26	<dogmaster>	amr, thanks for the tip.... I'll start with Reiser 4 and then try using ZFS with Solaris later on, or perhaps stay on Ubuntu when ZFS finds it way over to Linux.
03:26	<iobelisk>	do you think 20 gigs for the root folder is too big of a partition?
03:26	<toxidas>	crazy_bus: i've disabled compiz seems ok
03:26	<mrj>	Ward1983, then don't upgrade it, i've got plenty of other computers to use, in fact i'm ircing from my bsd laptop sitting next to my ubuntu
03:26	<Evanlec>	amr, i see, so ext3 still is the fs one should use unless you have some specific need
03:26	<haru>	dansku, edit sources.list

03:26	<seamus7>	Sgt_Shankers: maybe cause tonight is an incredibly busy night on those servers...
03:26	<Raineer>	iobelisk: in my experience that is more than you need, but it won't hurt anything
03:26	<toxidas>	but i also have a slow boot problem do you have it also?
03:26	<dansku>	haru, how w
03:26	<dansku>	?
03:26	<kahrytan>	Can someone help me fix the fonts on my gutsy system? I did something to cause text on pages to be small. And it's not firefox related.  (http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o200/kahrytan/snapshot1.png)

03:26	<Ward1983>	mrj, then you're lucky :p i only got a old laptop and this desktop
03:26	<black_13>	haru what i am looking for turning off kernel output
03:26	<Jonfish>	mine boots pretty slowly toxidas
03:26	<cafuego>	gspfranc: stop spamming
03:26	<kahrytan>	Someone help me
03:26	<Ward1983>	lets spam gspfranc
03:27	<vocx>	gspfranc, do that again and you are out
03:27	<pwnguin>	darkguy: daniel robbins (founder of gentoo) had a series of articles on tuning filesystems, but i cant seem to find any on ext3 on developer works.
03:27	<Ward1983>	lol
03:27	<AncientRelic>	What boot options should I have come for Compaq laptop?
03:27	<jimmygoon>	Did anyone else get some ... interesting problems... with the alternative install disc?
03:27	<|neon|>	if i had the rc installed do   i need to re-install final release or just do an upgrade/dist-upgrade
03:27	<amr>	evanlec , yes sure ext3 is good but reiser is faster but i read it frgments over time unlike ext3 that is solid and never fragment
03:27	<darkcrab>	what does medubuntu have it besides the w32 codecs?
03:27	<haru>	black_13, oh.. my screen just blinks instead of displaying splash
03:27	<dansku>	ok
03:27	<dansku>	ill take a look
03:27	<Evanlec>	kahrytan, you're gonna ahve to track down what it is that u did to make ur fonts small
03:27	<kahrytan>	Gutsy is full of bugs
03:27	<crazy_bus>	toxidas: I'm not running compiz.
03:27	<pwnguin>	darkguy: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fs7.html is a start...
03:27	<bsundsrud>	anyone know anything about webcams in gnome?
03:27	<mrj>	|neon|, you can update/upgrade. i personally did a fresh install though
03:27	<toxidas>	Jonfish: so nobody seems to know why me neither
03:27	<jimmygoon>	my gdm text (the text in the input boxes) is HUGE and out-of-box the window titlebar font is like 72... it takes up like half the screen...
03:27	<darkguy>	cafuego: ah, I didn't know Ubuntu would get that instead of the PrintScreen feature, sorry - there isn't any place where I can see what can I say or not in this channel... besides if we're not to suggest it, then the devs should remove that shortcut from the hotkeys configuration window then.
03:27	<|neon|>	mrj: thx
03:27	<haru>	kahrytan, so is everything else
03:27	<kahrytan>	Evanlec, changing the font to verdana. thats it.
03:27	<PovAddict>	back from dinner, and printer configuration hell
03:27	<IcemanV9>	haru: someone had the same problem as yours few days ago. i think it's related to xorg.conf ... i couldn't remember what exactly it was.
03:27	<cyphase>	seeing as this is the gutsy support channel now..
03:27	<ale[x]>	i'm trying to do a preseed install, anyone know how I can skip cdrom detection?.
03:27	<Ward1983>	mrj, i think i'll go for a clean install on the laptop tomorrow then to try it out, i'm not very dependant of that one
03:27	<cafuego>	darkcrab: Possibly a fixed libmp4v2 and/or ffmpeg with mp4/aac support. i've not checked it for gutsy yet.
03:27	<dasiala>	I am about to download the liveCD to do a fresh install of Gutsy, but I'm not sure if I want the standard x86 version or the 64bit version.  I have a Dell 1420N with a Intel Centrino Core 2 Duo
03:27	<Evanlec>	amr, but is reiser noticeably faster? or is it only faster for copying and small files?
03:27	<Ward1983>	mrj, thanx for the info
03:27	<cyphase>	has anyone had problems with their rtl8180 wifi card?
03:28	<darkguy>	pwnguin: huh :( all I know abou tuning HD stuff is hdparm xD
03:28	<mrj>	Ward1983, np
03:28	<Pici>	kahrytan: if everything is still very small, try increasing the font dpi
03:28	<iobelisk>	raineer: my laptop has only 80 gigs. what would be an optimum partition size for root? i will be installing a few games and inkscape, scribus and i need to try out a few non linear editors too
03:28	<Evanlec>	kahrytan, okay so u changed the font to verdana, and now if u change it back it doesnt fix it?
03:28	<darkcrab>	thank you cafuego
03:28	<haru>	IcemanV9, might be.. on a ati so :( tho xserver works fine :) only usplash doesnt show
03:28	<kahrytan>	Pici,  where is that
03:28	<pwnguin>	Pici: what if i think the font's too tall now?
03:28	<atlantiz_>	hey how do you install LAMP on Gutsy?
03:28	<KaiForce>	iobelisk i would think 10gb should do it
03:28	<amr>	evanlec , yes only with multiple small files but large files the same or slightly un-noticed faster
03:28	<Leann>	:|
03:28	<vocx>	dasiala, x86. If you want to use the 64-bit version head to the 64-bit subforums in ubuntuforums.org and read.

Trying to recover:
03:28	<PovAddict>	atlantiz_: you got the 'L' already :)
03:28	<Evanlec>	dasiala, there's some in here that would argue withme, but i dont see any reason now to NOT USE X64
03:28	<Pici>	kahrytan: system>preferences>appearance>fonts and theres a button in there, advanced or something
03:28	<Mmph>	hi I am trying to use wubi to install a 64bit ISO, is this possible?
03:28	<cafuego>	darkguy: Yes, it's odd. The kernel certainly does have CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y set
03:28	<mrj>	atlantiz_, same as any other version
03:28	<pwnguin>	darkguy: basically, consider the size of the journal, and the writeback policy
03:28	<randomwalker>	when the package updater updates my kernel it automatically deletes windows from the grub menu
03:28	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, paste ur /etc/apt/sources.list
03:29	<randomwalker>	this is annoying!
03:29	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, pastebin ur /etc/apt/sources.list
03:29]  * cyphase is downloading packages at a painfully slow speed
03:29	<eb_>	can't seem to complete the update process, it can't find a couple packages on the server.
03:29	<linux_stu>	does kubuntu 7.10 come with compiz fusion by default?
03:29	<cyphase>	linux_stu: no
03:29	<Pici>	linux_stu: no
03:29	<Evanlec>	dasiala, sorry i meant to emphasize There's No Reason To Not Use 64bit IMO
03:29	<mrj>	cyphase, so is everyone
03:29	<wescotte>	Can you d/l the 7.10 ISO and upgrade a 7.04 machine from it instead of usign the update manager and doing a distro update?
03:29	<WorkingOnWise>	haru:  k.
03:29	<darkguy>	cafuego: heh, scary XD I won't do it again, don't worry :p thanks for the advice ^^;
03:29	<KaiForce>	whats the word - hold off on the gibbon for now or what?
03:29	<Pici>	!compiz-#kubuntu | linux_stu
03:29	<ubotu>	linux_stu: Kubuntu is not shipping with compiz installed or enabled by default. You can still install it and have your eyecandy goodness. The instructions are at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusion
03:29	<iobelisk>	when i install software, all installation files will go to the root folder, yes? so would a 10 gig partition be too small for a few games and graphical programs? all data files would be in root of course
03:29	<WorkingOnWise>	!pastebin
03:29	<cyphase>	mrj: i know, just thought i'd share
03:29	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
03:29	<cafuego>	dasiala: well.
03:29	<darkguy>	pwnguin: alright :D
03:29	<linux_stu>	thanks cyphase and Pici
03:29	<cyphase>	mrj: :)
03:29	<mrj>	lol
03:29	<PovAddict>	wescotte: if you use alternate CD, you can use the CD as an apt source
03:29	<kahrytan>	Pici,  that doesnt help either
03:29	<MasterShrek>	hey Evanlec
03:29	<Pici>	kahrytan: Sorry :(
03:29	<mrj>	cyphase, do the best server thing in sources
03:29	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, hey man
03:29	<MasterShrek>	lovin 7.10?
03:29	<wescotte>	PovAddict: ok cool thanks
03:29	<mrj>	cyphase, it pretty much fixes the slow downloads
03:29	<amr>	evanlec, use resider if you don't care about fragmentation , cpu usage or support and use ext3 if you like compitability and stability
03:30	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, oh ya ;p 7.10 x64 :)
03:30	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, that realtime kernel is worth it
03:30	<kahrytan>	pici webpage font stays the same
03:30	<Mmph>	If I install a 32bit ubuntu can I make it into a 64bit with apt-get later?
03:30	<Pici>	!reiser | Evanlec
03:30	<ubotu>	Evanlec: reiserfs is a journalling file system, which outperforms many others on I/O operations, but has drawbacks (such as increasing likelihood of data loss, and introducing latency unsuitable for gaming or real-time audio). Using !ext3, the default on Ubuntu, is *highly* recommended. A read-only Windows driver is available at http://p-nand-q.com/download/rfstool.html
03:30	<RAdams>	how much of a performance hit do I take if I choose an encrpyted LVM?
03:30	<mrj>	Mmph, no
03:30	<MasterShrek>	me 2 Evanlec 64...mmm
03:30	<|neon|>	does any one knows if the intel ichr9 raid controller works with gutsy (bbeen that is fake raid)
03:30	<Mmph>	thanks mrj
03:30	<haru>	RAdams, 81%
03:30	<Pici>	kahrytan: firefox's fonts are in its own appearance properties
03:30	<mboso>	can UUID be replaced with LABEL in fstab and grub? I can't stand this UUID nonsense anymore
03:30	<cyphase>	mrj: good point.. thanx for the reminder
03:30	<RAdams>	haru: how  is that calculated?
03:30	<PovAddict>	so, back to my network problem
03:30	<kahrytan>	Pici, but its not there
03:30	<MasterShrek>	mboso, you can use the regular /dev devices in fstab
03:30	<kahrytan>	*that
03:30	<haru>	RAdams, 100*rand(1)
03:30	<dipu>	anyone has used webcam with ubuntu ... i want to enable it but have no idea .. i have a SONY vaio with built in webcam
03:30	<mboso>	everytime i dist-upgrade, my kernel segfaults
03:31	<Pici>	kahrytan: What do you mean its not there?
03:31	<KaiForce>	iobelisk I think so, but I'm basing that on my feisty install, i don't have the gibbon yet
03:31	<Evanlec>	Pici, thanks for that clear-up
03:31	<RAdams>	haru: :|
03:31	<Pici>	kahrytan: Just go to advanced
03:31	<sandrot>	how do you setup the "take a break" thing again?
03:31	<kahrytan>	Pici,  thats not the problem. it's not firefox related.
03:31	<seamus7>	dipu: I have found webcams poorly supported in ubuntu
03:31	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, is it now? are u talking about the Ubuntu kernel or a vanilla kernel?
03:31	<Pici>	kahrytan: I'm not sure what the question is then
03:31	<vocx>	mboso, read the manual for fstab and mount, maybe you can use LABELs also
03:31	<jk__>	anyone here with a T60 thinkpad who has upgraded to 7.10 ?
03:31	<mboso>	MasterShrek: yeah i know, but ubuntu keeps updating my fstab automatically. I was wondering if using LABEL would satisfy it
03:31	<haru>	RAdams, i dont think anyone has a figure anywho, shudnt be much tho
03:31	<kahrytan>	Pici,  look at the screenshot
03:31	<RAdams>	haru, you could have just said "there are too many variables to accurately answer that question" X_X
03:31	<jimmygoon>	gah! buggy buggy ubuntu-alternative! :(
03:31	<Pici>	kahrytan: link?
03:31	<haru>	lol
03:31	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, well im using the vanilla kernel, but the ubuntu one im sure just has lowlatency
03:31	<cafuego>	dasiala: For a desktop box, 32bit is just a tad easier to manage; no extra work to get java applets and/or video to work in web browsers.
03:31	<Raineer>	iobelisk: I think 10gb will be plenty good, I've been running gutsy tribe releases and there's nothing different from fiesty which would use more room
03:31	<KaiForce>	why not JFS for those talking about ext3/Reiser
03:31	<cyphase>	mrj: much faster :).. thanks again
03:32	<mrj>	jimmygoon, worked fine for me
03:32	<dipu>	is there no way i can get built in  webcam working in ubuntu ??
03:32	<RAdams>	haru: ok, thanks. I'll give it a shot. I can always nuke it if it's too slow
03:32	<atlantiz_>	mrj, thanks
03:32	<kahrytan>	Pici, http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o200/kahrytan/snapshot1.png)
03:32	<juanbond>	mrj, when I tried sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx, I got the message: The following packages have unmet dependencies: xorg-driver-fglrx: Depends: libstdc++5 (>= 1:3.3.4-1) but is not installable... E: Broken packages.
03:32	<MasterShrek>	mboso, doubtful, might as well just leave it, let ubuntu deal with it, it cant bother u THAT much
03:32	<haru>	gl :)
03:32	<dansku>	how do I refresh .bashrc to make new aliases work?
03:32	<RAdams>	dipu: laptop model?
03:32	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, well i know feisty had a "lowlatency" version, and i thot gutsy had a newly named "realtime" version similar, but i havent investigated...
03:32	<cafuego>	dansku: . .bashrc
03:32	<jimmygoon>	mrj, sooo strange. these are the same problems I had with the beta2... but I torrented the new version today...
03:32	<dasiala>	cafuego: its a laptop
03:32	<riotkittie>	phew. finally. that was weird
03:32	<haru>	juanbond, did u upgrade? or reinstall?
03:32	<Evanlec>	KaiForce, I dunno, why not?
03:32	<RAdams>	evanlec: yes, realtime = lowlatency
03:32	<juanbond>	clean install.
03:32	<kahrytan>	Pici,  the rest of the fonts every else is normal as they supposed to be.
03:32	<Whisperkiller>	whats the problem with gutsy people are having?
03:32	<RAdams>	evanlec: I'm using it now
03:32	<mboso>	MasterShrek: its the kernel segfaulting after an upgrade that bothers me
03:32	<dipu>	RAdamssony vaio VGN FE780 G
03:33	<Evanlec>	RAdams, right, but is there a patched gutsy kernel that i can just install from synaptic?
03:33	<mrj>	juanbond, see if libstdc++5 is installed in synaptic, maybe reinstall it
03:33	<cafuego>	dasiala: Do not server use; go with 32bit.
03:33	<PovAddict>	I tried gutsy desktop livecd (i386), after booting, I had no network. I have a router connected via ethernet. I use it from Windows and Mac with static IP, DHCP works as well, so I doubt the problem is the router. Could be the network card on this computer. According to WinXP device list, it's a Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC.
03:33	<RAdams>	evanlec: yes
03:33	<KaiForce>	JFS is solid and the developer isn't on trial
03:33	<jimmygoon>	mrj, they were problems that eventually got fixed in updates during the beta->rc but this isn't the first ubuntu release where I've had the alt disc be considerably different than the desktop installation
03:33	<checkers>	hi all, does anyone know of a program like synctoy for windows that I can use on ubuntu? I want to keep my music folder on my windows laptop mirrored on my ubuntu laptop
03:33	<cafuego>	dasiala: (desktop applications I meant, not desktop hardware)
03:33	<Whisperkiller>	ive been in other rooms and people seem to be having problems with gutsy
03:33	<emeriste>	how can i tell if pidentd is installed?
03:33	<Pici>	kahrytan: Whats wrong with that?
03:33	<PovAddict>	checkers: rsync :)
03:33	<kahrytan>	Pici,  the fonts are tiny in the page
03:33	<Evanlec>	cafuego, why got 32bit? cuz he on a laptop?
03:33	<kahrytan>	in every website
03:33	<Whisperkiller>	anyone got any comments on gutsy issues?
03:33	<v3ctor>	KaiForce: but it comes from IBM
03:33	<KaiForce>	checkers, ditch synctoy in Windows, use dsynchronize
03:33	<v3ctor>	jk
03:33	<checkers>	PovAddict, I was under the impression you needed an rsync server
03:33	<KaiForce>	heh
03:34	<Raineer>	PovAddict: I have had an issue with RTL8139 not being seen either. Didn't work in fiesty and hasn't worked up to the latest beta of gutsy
03:34	<Evanlec>	RAdams, coolness, that will be easier than compiling a vanilla kernel ;p
03:34	<mrj>	jimmygoon, i always have problems with the livecd's so i use alts. dunno, i used alts in beta also, no problems
03:34	<haru>	Whisperkiller, they will be fixed
03:34	<Pici>	kahrytan: The page itself is tiny on my screen.
03:34	<RAdams>	evanlec: http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/metapackages/linux-rt
03:34	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41151/
03:34	<mrj>	jimmygoon, are you burning it at a low speed?
03:34	<cafuego>	Evanlec: Because some desktop apps and addons "just work" where they wouldn't on 64bit.
03:34	<checkers>	KaiForce, thanks
03:34	<PovAddict>	Raineer: I tried SabayonLinux too, same problem
03:34	<ARCKEDA>	:D
03:34	<mrj>	once again i reboot and my desktop icons are all gone
03:34	<openbysource>	guys i am having serious problem with gutsy's installation
03:34	<mrj>	lol
03:34	<PovAddict>	but it worked on my other computer which has a totally different card
03:34	<VeganCheesesteak>	i have a boot loader question....  if my main drive is sda  would boot loader be sd0 or sda?
03:34	<cyphase>	Raineer: i had a problem with the rtl8180. not the same, but close
03:34	<jimmygoon>	mrj, yeah. these were two different discs too... too "extreme" that this exact thing was messed up then and now for it to be a coincidence...
03:34	<KaiForce>	checkers not sure on Linux an equivalent utility but I'm sure it exists
03:34	<openbysource>	earlier i installed gutsy and re-booted it said Error: no operating system found
03:34	<Evanlec>	cafuego, lol, yea i spose ur right, but really the gap is narrowing these days, im running 64-bit and havent had anything not "just work" so far...
03:34	<kahrytan>	Pici,  is the image at full size?
03:35	<jimmygoon>	mrj, neither of the bugs bother me (That much) but its annoying
03:35	<kahrytan>	Pici,  ie shrinked.
03:35	<openbysource>	now i am again installing it and it has hanged at the same step scanning mirrors (have been here for 30 minutes or so)
03:35	<Raineer>	PovAddict: I found several posts refferring to modules which could be loaded into the kernel, but never had any luck.
03:35	<cafuego>	Evanlec: java in firefox.
03:35	<checkers>	KaiForce, oh, dsyncronise is for windows?
03:35	<RAdams>	vegancheesesteak: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
03:35	<juanbond>	mrj, synaptic is telling me libstdc++6 is install, i don't see a 5 though.
03:35	<emeriste>	do any of you use pidentd ? I need to understand how to make it work with Ubuntu
03:35	<openbysource>	ain't there any way i can disable this scanning ?
03:35	<KaiForce>	checkers yes...  i prefer it to synctoy
03:35	<dasiala>	I suppose I'll get a livecd of both and see which one works better
03:35	<PovAddict>	Raineer: well, that will block me from ever switching to Linux, so there better be some solution
03:35	<mrj>	jimmygoon, cdburner maybe going out.. mine started burning crap for about a year then one day just completely stopped reading dvds
03:35	<Evanlec>	cafuego, from personal experience, i believe that is a non-issue as of now
03:35	<kahrytan>	Pici,  this have got to be abug
03:36	<PovAddict>	since my question is now 3 pages lost in char history given the channel speed, I'll repeat
03:36	<Pici>	kahrytan: I'm just not seeing the issue, sorry.
03:36	<cafuego>	Evanlec: it certainly happily crashes on lots of sites here with blackdown jre 1.4
03:36	<PovAddict>	no network, Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC not being recognized
03:36	<openbysource>	any ideas guys ?
03:36	<Atalanta>	anyone using 7.10-release right now?
03:36	<dasiala>	Now, I had tried to update to 7.10RC a few days ago, and it wouldn't boot X on startup.  Will doing a clean install most likely correct this problem?
03:36	<kahrytan>	Pici, if the image is not shrinked, that is exact font size I see.  IT IS REALLY TINY
03:36	<Raineer>	PovAddict: My onboard works, but not the realtek card.  I know some people have the thing working, I just haven't been able to get it to work with Ubuntu. It might require a more recent kernel, but I'm disappointed I can't find a module which works
03:36	<cafuego>	Atalanta: Yah
03:36	<Pici>	kahrytan: What resolution are you running at?
03:36	<MasterShrek>	Atalanta, most ppl are
03:36	<riotkittie>	PovAddict: does it show in lspci ?
03:36	<vocx>	PovAddict, wired? It should work.

03:36	<Raineer>	no, it will not show up in lspci
03:36	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, are you using alternate or live?
03:36	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, paste error again?
03:36	<VeganCheesesteak>	RAdams: im way too much a noob...i dont understand
03:36	<cafuego>	Atalanta: Not really, no.
03:36	<PovAddict>	Raineer: hmm so this card isn't onboard?
03:37	<Evanlec>	cafuego, in gutsy 64 all i did was apt-get install flash and it installed the nspluginwrapper for me...so its using official flash 9...
03:37	<WorkingOnWise>	atlantiz_: I an on 7.10.
03:37	<gidim>	I ran into a snag, not enough free disk space.
03:37	<jimmygoon>	mrj, I used my desktop to burn one of the discs... and why would it "misread" in only two spots.. in the exact same spots, on two different drives, in two different ISOs :S

03:37	<darkguy>	PovAddict: I dunno much about those, but if it's external have you tried to move it to another PCI slot? I once had a big issue with a sound card and it was because somehow the PCI wasn't recognizing it first or something around it.
03:37	<PovAddict>	riotkittie: I dunno, I should reboot and check
03:37	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, have u had any problems with flash on gutsy 64? cuz i havent so far...
03:37	<jimmygoon>	mrj, I'm thinking its something quirky about my laptop
03:37	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, too bad nspluginwrapper wont work with jave....
03:37	<kahrytan>	Pici,  the text size in image is exact size I see in page. Image isnt reduced in size.
03:37	<rflmnz>	i've installed Ubuntu 7.10 right now
03:37	<MasterShrek>	not at all Evanlec
03:37	<mrj>	jimmygoon, sounds like a hardware/media issue to me
03:37	<RAdams>	vegancheesesteak: what are you trying to do with grub?
03:37	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, what mjr said, also if that is still problematic, just disable software sources
03:37	<seamus7>	dipu: are you using Vaio's MotionEye webcam?
03:37	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, ahh yes, how did u handle the java issue btw?
03:37	<Raineer>	PovAddict: Mine is a $40 wired PCI gigabit card, but uses the 8139 chip
03:37	<PovAddict>	darkguy: I think it's not external, but anyway I'd rather not fiddle with hardware

03:37	<cafuego>	Evanlec: nspluginwrapper doesn't count as "just works".
03:37	<mrj>	i'll brb
03:38	<Raineer>	I could try another PCI slot, never tried that
03:38	<darkguy>	PovAddict: heh, ok it was a suggestion :p
03:38	<VeganCheesesteak>	RAdams: im trying to install gutsy, but its selecting the wrong drive to put the boot loader on
03:38	<vocx>	adminn, you do not, ha

03:44	<H2600>	I have a not-so-unique install scenario that I was hoping someone could help me with
03:44	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, that might work, then afterwords change it back to 700
03:44	<H2600>	or at least point me in the right direction
03:44	<pppoe_dude>	*afterwards

03:45	<dzer0>	hello
03:45	<Atalanta>	im trying to figure out who the ops of this channel are
03:45	<Al00>	"upgraded" from 7.04 to 7.10 today... ouch -- Video is choppy and messed up (ATI Radeaon 800x PCIe) -- anyone  experience something similar?
03:45	<seamus7>	crossbones: i don't have issues with my synaptic touchpad .. not sure what's going on ... ask again specifically about that one .
03:45	<Atalanta>	Pici: do you know who some are?
03:45	<Dan_L>	Ok.  I'm highly cheesed.  I downloaded 7.10 from the torrent site.  I selected "gutsy amd64 desktop" which I thought would be ubuntu.  Instead it's something called xbuntu.
03:45	<realshiva>	hi
03:45	<ramvi>	gladeir: Try sudo apt-get update / sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl
03:46	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	IcemanV9: I'll try. Thanks. Should never ever upgrade
03:46	<localgod11>	does anyones Gutsy run slower than fiesty?
03:46	<Evanlec>	Pici, shoulda told him, sry
03:46	<jimmygoon>	mrj, I just hope that my codecs aren't screwed up like in the beta --- totem was stretching all of my vids wrongly
03:46	<Atalanta>	Pici: huh? what do yu mean abuse !ops ?
03:46	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, what error do you get?
03:46	<Madpilot>	Atalanta, ops is like calling 911. Do not use it just to ask questions.
03:46	<jimmygoon>	Atalanta got kicked?!
03:46	<jimmygoon>	:O
03:46	<mrj>	jimmygoon, i didn't mess with movies in beta much
03:46	<gladeir>	ramvi - ive tried that
03:46	<cafuego>	My gutsy on the pentium 2 runs slower than feisty on the opteron.
03:46	<Evanlec>	Atalanta, doing that alerts all the ops, they dont like it
03:46	<dzer0>	I'm using the 7.10 live cd on my laptop now, absolutely LOVING it... But, I don't want to have to spend a ton of time backing up and restoring just to install... is there a way to install ubuntu over windows on the same HD without losing any data?

03:46	<ramvi>	Dan_L: Yeah, you wouldnt want Xubuntu
03:46	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: the error was Error ; no operating system found when i rebooted after the install. the install didn't finised but it never gave any error too
03:46	<seamus7>	Dan_L: xubuntu is a variation of ubuntu that uses a different desktop manager and is leaner .. less memory intensive ... primarily for older systems ... you need to download 'ubuntu'
03:46	<lwizardl>	hi
03:46	<Atalanta>	Pici: in other channels !ops tells you who the ops are.
03:46	<vocx>	Atalanta, you can query ubotu so you do not need to use the !ops trigger in here if you do not need to.
03:46	<unagi>	how do i install libdvdcss2
03:47	<mrj>	in here ops pings all the ops
03:47	<dryrot>	does Xen work in gutsy
03:47	<plik>	Atalanta: only if it's set up to do so
03:47	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, i thought you were still in live, pre-install
03:47	<avt>	***** it installed now what?
03:47	<Madpilot>	Atalanta, Pici - everytime you use ops w/ ! a lot of us get pinged...
03:47	<Pici>	Atalanta: It pings every single one of us to tell us that something is happening here
03:47	<lwizardl>	does 7.10 still need fuse to support mac hfs+
03:47	<tritium>	Atalanta: don't do that again
03:47	<Atalanta>	Pici: well in any case, im trying to ask the ops if its okay to create #ubuntu-gutsy for 7.10 support to lighten the load off this channel for a few days
03:47	<ramvi>	unagi: insert a dvd and try to play it
03:47	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: now i have again re-booted into live
03:47	<plik>	have a look or the @nest to nicks in the names list
03:47	<ruz322>	dzer0, not really, you could leave your ntfs partition in tact and install ubuntu to the free space on the drive, then mount the ntfs from inside linux and copy it over, but either way, you still have to copy it to linux eventually
03:47	<realshiva>	unagi sudo apt-get install ...
03:47	<iobelisk>	for some reason i get a partition failed
03:47	<arun__>	are there any advantages to upgrading using an alternate cd?
03:47	<Dan_L>	Seamus, yeah.  I'm figured.  I'm just cheesed that wasn't clear in the torrent description.
03:47	<unagi>	!svc
03:47	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about svc - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
03:47	<crossbones>	there are bugs with the trackpad driver ("kernel: [664.668000] psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio4/input0 lost sync at byte 4") - syslog; the symptom is the mouse stops responding then moves irraticely as I try to click something, it usually breaks when I am doing several tasks at the same time and I try to click something. Any ideas or should I just file a bug report?
03:47	<iobelisk>	is there any reason this might happen?
03:47	<unagi>	!svn
03:47	<ubotu>	svn is Subversion: an open-source revision control system, which aims to be a compelling replacement for CVS. See http://subversion.tigris.org/
03:47	<Madpilot>	Atalanta, not needed.
03:47	<the_darkside_986>	does anyone have a link to an example xorg.conf file suitable for running Xserver from the liveCD?
03:47	<Al00>	"upgraded" from 7.04 to 7.10 today... ouch -- Video is choppy and messed up (ATI Radeaon 800x PCIe) -- anyone  experience something similar?
03:47	<ramvi>	arun__: Youre upgrading with a cd??
03:47	<tritium>	Atalanta: non-official channels need two ##, e.g. ##ubuntu-gutsy
03:47	<avt>	what about me
03:47	<Pici>	Atalanta: That won't happen, we've discussed splitting and the consensus after much deliberation was to not do it.
03:48	<seamus7>	arun__: I use the alternate CD when I do fresh installations in order to have more control when partitioning
03:48	<vocx>	Atalanta, Madpilot Pici maybe you should talk in #ubuntu-ops
03:48	<Atalanta>	ok
03:48	<Sir_Sid>	when does gutsy get its backports?
03:48	<arun__>	ramvi: considering it
03:48	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, you will need the home directory if you are booting into the system, but if you are installing a fresh install, setting chmod 000 to your user directory, and installing into a different home directory should do OK
03:48	<tonyyarusso>	Sir_Sid: huh?
03:48	<KaiForce>	is service pack 2 out yet
03:48	<Evanlec>	Pici, dont u think its annoyingly crowded in here tho?
03:48	<Flats>	neone tell me how to set the shell to bash?
03:48	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, that's if you want to avoid the migration assistant.
03:48	<ruz322>	Kaiforce, for what?
03:48	<avt>	FGLRX installed now what do I do???
03:48	<vocx>	Sir_Sid, when the next Ubuntu comes out.
03:48	<dzer0>	ruz322: I didn't mean I never wanted to copy it over, just never wanted to deal with using a separate drive for backup... so can I just install ubuntu on my free space, copy files over, then delete the ntfs partition and resize the ubuntu one to be bigger?
03:48	<dansku>	is the apt-get slow because the number of people using it right now?
03:48	<Pici>	Evanlec: Its not tha tbad.
03:48	<KaiForce>	ruz its just a joke.
03:48	<tonyyarusso>	dansku: yes
03:48	<seamus7>	dansku: yesw
03:48	<XsteelWolf>	dansku, depends on your mirror
03:48	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: very tricky and weird way again. isnt' there any menu to do the same ?
03:48	<arun__>	is there any advantage to upgrading using a cd, than upgrading over network?
03:49	<IcemanV9>	avt: fglrxinfo works? glxinfo |grep direct ... if yes, then you're ready to compile compiz on dapper ( i don't have info on compiz howto for dapper)
03:49	<tonyyarusso>	arun__: faster
03:49	<Sir_Sid>	tonyyarusso, When the backport repos
03:49	<Evanlec>	Pici, i spose, hard to follow conversations tho, maybe its just my setup
03:49	<XsteelWolf>	i was getting 100bytes per sec,just changed a mirror and was bursting 1000kb/s
03:49	<dansku>	ah, ok :) good to know :)
03:49	<bjron>	Pici: I dissagree, way too many ppl
03:49	<tonyyarusso>	Sir_Sid: when there's something to put in them
03:49	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, i thought that that specific step in the installer asked to to take that option or refuse it
03:49	<un1x01d>	rryan, thanks a lot everything worked and gnome terminal has a bug jsut had to patch the nvidia driver a little for now everything seems to work peachy except compiz
03:49	<plik>	arun__: net servers are v. busy now so cd will prolly be quicker
03:49	<H2600>	i'm new to ubuntu, can i install to a free space on my second hard drive without destroying what i already have saved on it?
03:49	<Sir_Sid>	hehe alright
03:49	<seamus7>	arun__: updates over the network could be more ... up-to-date
03:49	<ruz322>	dzer0, yes, you can do that, you will need to drop your ntfs parititon size first though, then just install ubuntu and copy what you want over, you will need to install the package "ntfs-config" to get access to it from ubuntu, then you can fix your hdd however you want
03:49	<tonyyarusso>	H2600: yes
03:49	<pppoe_dude>	however, i am still running a daily build of gutsy, so perhaps that changed in the release, openbysource

03:49	<ice799>	Hi - I am installing gutsy on an old server machine that has an adapter scsi card with 1 scsi disk attached, and a cdrom drive. It seems that ata_piix is unhappy with the cdrom drive because the installation begins but suddenly fails as the installer is unable to read from the drive. When I check the dmesg, I see that gutsy is scrolling messages about ata being slow to respond and eventually it gives up (and my cdrom drive stops worki
03:49	<ice799>	ng) -- is there a workaround for this (the old piix driver worked fine, but that was deprecated in gutsy).
03:49	<arun__>	arang2: what do you like most about it
03:50]  * arang2 wishes they released the patch for gnome 2.20 to 2.20.1 
03:50	<apeezee>	SO i think the gutsy update went ok, but i am having trouble getting the nvidia driver to work
=== thomas_ is now known as thill2708
03:50	<arang2>	arun__: for some reason it's snappier
03:50	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: oh well. what if i give a separate /home to gutsy. right now i am giving only 2 partitions. / and swap
03:50	<Jimdb>	H2600:  it will ask you during the install and give you the choice to resize the partition.
03:50	<arang2>	arun__: might be just the kernel i dunno
03:50	<dzer0>	ruz322: I actually just realized that I've got a network share that would be much easier... can I get into the ntfs in ubuntu to copy the files over?
03:50	<arang2>	arun__: my game under wine that didnt run with feisty run in gutsy
03:50	<iobelisk>	i get this error message while tyring to partition my drive: The ext3 file system creation in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed.
03:50	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, generally it is a better idea to make a separate home / root partitions
03:50	<the_darkside_986>	i am still unable to run X server from the live CD in gutsy. but in feisty it all works just fine.
03:50	<iobelisk>	is there any reason why this should happen? all drives are unmounted
03:50	<pppoe_dude>	*separate home and root partitions, openbysource
03:50	<thill2708>	I installed the tifm module onto gutsy, but when I insert a sony memory stick into my card reader, nothing happens. Dmesg outputs that a memory stick has been put in the socket, but... nothing happens. Any ideas?
03:50	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: still blank
03:50	<vocx>	openbysource, separate /home is a must, very useful to backup stuff without losing your files
03:50	<H2600>	tonyyarusso: thanks, i couldn't find that on my own
03:50	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: yeah i am also thinking now to give a separate /home to gutsy
03:51	<FatGutsy>	I have installed msttcorefonts on gutsy, however the fonts do not appear to be available in openoffice, this used to work in feisty, does anyone know if there is any additional steps to make msttcorefonts work correctly on gutsy now?
03:51	<ruz322>	dzer0, what do you mean? if you install ubuntu to unpartitioned space on your hard drive along with windows, then yes, you can pull stuff from the ntfs partition to the linux partition
03:51	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, no need, just give it another directory in your /home partition
03:51	<Jimdb>	thedarksize:  i had similar issues....replaced by dvd drive and was able to run the live cd under gutsy
03:51	<GarryFre>	arang2 What game?
03:51	<dansku>	XsteelWolf: what source are you using?
03:51	<arun__>	if i have a separate /home partition, will any files get affected if i upgrade?

03:52	<unagi>	Package libdvdcss2 is not available, but is referred to by another package.

03:52	<unagi>	is only available from another source
03:52	<unagi>	E: Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate
03:52	<plik>	ToddEDM: better to sudo su
03:52	<Pici>	Flats: its possible that its referring to the fact that /bin/sh is symlinked to dash, not bash.
03:52	<DShepherd>	bjron, well.. clean install for me. err

03:53	<Flats>	•Pici• does it make a difference?
03:53	<the_darkside_986>	for successfull nvidia users... how do you successfully use the puny "nv" driver to run a graphical desktop installation? what is the secret trick here?

03:53	<ruz322>	ToddEDM, the easiest way to get root in the UI is to enable root login, and then login as root

03:53	<plik>	dansku:  alternate install cd torrent from http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/
=== _3v1n0_ is now known as Trevinho
03:53	<Evanlec>	the_darkside_986, it wont run compiz but it should boot to X no problem...
03:53	<mr_wang>	how do i update using the CD?
03:54	<ruz322>	ToddEDM, sudo passwd root, that will let you set a password for the root account and will alow you to login as root
03:54	<dryrot>	zhanx: you can encrypted a directory with encfs
03:54	<Stubbers>	how long should the install get stuck on "scanning the mirror"?
03:54	<Davy_Jones>	anyone knows and tested a download manager other than d4x?
03:54	<tritium>	ToddEDM: better to use sudo, though
03:54	<jimmygoon>	in fact it (doesn't freeze) but is un-manipulatable
03:54	<juanbond>	Has anyone else been able to install fglrx without any problems?
03:54	<vocx>	Stubbers, read the topic.
03:54	<zhanx>	dryrot thinking the the whole lvm

03:54	<Pici>	!dash | Flats
03:54	<ubotu>	Flats: /bin/sh links to the DASH shell in Ubuntu Edgy (6.10). Since DASH is not 100% compatible with the BASH shell, some scripts might break. You can make scripts execute using BASH by changing the first line of the script to « #! /bin/bash »
03:54	<dansku>	Davy_Jones: I like downthemall for firefox
03:54	<unagi>	how do you install libdvdcss2?
03:54	<the_darkside_986>	@Evanlec: it is not even running X server properly. Just a blank black screen no matter what I try to do...

03:54	<mr_wang>	the update severs are too slow how do i update using the CD?????
03:54	<Davy_Jones>	dansku: it doesn't seem to continue from where it leaves
03:54	<juanbond>	ramvi, ticked the box?
03:54	<ruz322>	haha yea, maybe not the safest way, but thats the easiest way to get a UI as root
03:54	<ramvi>	juanbond: had to do a repo update first though
03:54	<dryrot>	mr_wang: grab the alternative cd to update
03:54	<tritium>	mr_wang: they're being hammered today, as it's the first day of the release
03:55	<ramvi>	juanbond: in system >	restriced drivers
03:55	<GarryFre>	so is the upgrade to gibbon from fiesty large and did it take a long time for the dsl users out there?
03:55	<mr_wang>	i have the full cd...
03:55	<Evanlec>	the_darkside_986, hmm, are u seeing a splash screen or no?
03:55	<dryrot>	mr_wang: i used the kernel.org mirror and it updated pretty quickly
03:55	<the_darkside_986>	what does it mean when X results in a black screen but doesn't quit and tell me the error message?
03:55	<ruz322>	GarryFre, its not too bad, but it will take a while right now because there are a lot of people upgrading...
03:55	<juanbond>	ramvi, I've been trying to do that.  When I do I got a fix broken packages first.
03:55	<logreeval>	anyone?

03:56	<juanbond>	ramvi, trying to install through command i found out it need libstdc++5 and libstdc++6 was installed with gutsy.

03:56	<juanbond>	ramvi, clean install of gutsy
03:56	<plik>	PvAdct_ubuntu: now order yourself a decent NIC and trash that realtek junk  ;P
03:56	<Flats>	OK lets go this route, has neone tried to install the ieee80211-1.2.18 program for the Intel pro wireless adapter?
03:56	<gidim>	Okay, there we go.
03:56	<Evanlec>	the_darkside_986, okay well i asked because i had a 'no splash screen boot freeze' problem
03:56	<haru>	Evanlec, i see xserver but i dont see my splash, any ideas
03:56	<dryrot>	mr_wang: do you have the live cd or the alternative cd ?
03:56	<vocx>	!upgrade >	mr_wang
03:56	<mr_wang>	live cd
03:56	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	PvAdct_ubuntu: I should first install a decent OS (the one Im using now) and trash that windows junk
03:56	<anarchist>	I'm trying to get my wireless adapter to connect to my access point, can anyone help?
03:56	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	btw
03:56	<avt>	I found it!!!! :D http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=131253
03:57	<the_darkside_986>	you know you can change your boot options to remove "quiet splash" if having trouble with the progress bar and splash screen
03:57	<hb>	how do I get grub to install the bootloader on a /dev/md partition in the gutsy alternate install cd?
03:57	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	when somebody sends a message and pidgin scrolls the list, the scrolling is like WAY more smooth than from windows
03:57	<dryrot>	mr_wang: I'm pretty sure that you need the gutsy alternative cd to upgrade an already existing installation of feisty
03:57	<plik>	PvAdct_ubuntu: good point - get to it
03:57	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	wonder why that is
03:57	<Evanlec>	haru, i just disabled splash screen, for some reason x64 has a number of people including me not even able to boot from the liveCD because the splash screen hangs
03:57	<plik>	dryrot: correct
03:57	<Evanlec>	the_darkside_986, yes that is what i did..
03:57	<haru>	Evanlec, mines x32

03:58	<the_darkside_986>	i don't know... i've got a fully functional progress bar and splash but an X-server that refuses to admit failure. i can switch to other tty's but X doesn't die automatically
03:58	<hb>	no matter what I do /grub/device.map points (hd0) and (hd1) to /dev/sda /dev/sdb respectively.  those are the disks of the raid, but they're in stripe mode they're not independant.

03:58	<the_darkside_986>	any chance they can fix this stuff and re-release it soon. i can't wait 6 months for a usable Ubuntu system :(
03:59	<juanbond>	ramvi, to much going on in here.
03:59	<vocx>	kendall_, read the topic
03:59	<dansku>	where can i find cool programs and stuff that work on tray?
03:59	<AVARIEL>	first, the update manager was working, then it crashed and the system broke so i had to install it from a boot disk

03:59	<Evanlec>	the_darkside_986, why dont u just reinstall and use the nv driver this time
03:59	<|neon|>	i hate to do a fresh installed since my sys is running great, i just did an apt-get update and upgrade/dist-upgrade but no packages needed to be updated i been doing updates everydayy does that means my sys is uptodate or should i do a fresh install
03:59	<k0001>	hello everybody =)
03:59	<h08817>	hey all i did fdisk /mbr and set my system back to windows but left my windows/linux partition on the drive. How can I reinstall the boot loader for linux?
03:59	<sx66xfce>	hi
03:59	<AVARIEL>	oh and i use to display my feisty on a monitor with a dvi and i cant get that working on gutsy...plus when i tried it just messed up my resolution for my normal monitor !

03:59	<linuxpoe1>	Just a quick bounce, great job on gutsy
04:00	<bastid_raZor>	|neon|: you are up to date in that case.

04:00	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	haru: I have no sound either
04:00	<logreeval>	haru: it says PnP Audio Device..
04:00	<vocx>	the_darkside_986, if it really is bad, and you are not the only one they should fix it. I remember Feisty got a kernel upgrade almost immediately.
04:00	<|neon|>	bastid_raZor: thx
04:00	<AVARIEL>	guys, what do you think of gutsy ?
04:00	<the_darkside_986>	@Evanlec: I cannot even get to the point where I install or do a clean install because X server will never work on the liveCD. I'm on gutsy now but i am afraid to do a dist-upgrade
04:00	<k0001>	i'd like to know if there something like "live ubuntu server stats", just to know how many people downloaded ubuntu today =)=)=)
04:00	<dryrot>	|neon|: what are you trying to do?  it's not going to 'upgrade you to gutsy' unless you replace every instance of 'feisty' with 'gutsy' in /etc/apt/sources.list
04:00	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	oh wait
04:00	<localgod11>	anyone know where the nvidia-glx driver lives? (what repo)
04:00	<unagi>	CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO INSTALL LIBDVDCSS2

04:00	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	mr_wang: I dont think so
04:00	<VeganCheesesteak>	ok now my install is hung up on scanning the update mirror. im guessing this is because of the server load....will it time out and continue or sit there forever?
04:00	<haru>	logreeval, test sound throws error?
04:01	<jStefan>	PvAdct_ubuntu, thx
04:01	<AVARIEL>	anybody here sticking to feisty for a bit ?
04:01	<logreeval>	haru: yes
04:01	<dryrot>	mr_wang: no, you need the 'alternative' cd, not the live cd
04:01	<vocx>	AVARIEL, I
04:01	<|neon|>	dryrot: i had gutsy beta installed a while ago none reference to another i.e feisty

04:01	<Whisperkiller>	so just to recap....how does everyone like gutsy so far?
04:01	<AVARIEL>	why are you guys for waiting it out a bit
04:01	<the_darkside_986>	i am stuck using feisty until gutsy either drops all this compiz out-of-the-box or maybe my CD is just burnt wrong and somehow passed the test
04:01	<AVARIEL>	?
04:01	<plik>	dryrot: s/feisty/gutsy/g easy
04:01	<dryrot>	mr_wang: do you have a broadband connection?  grab a torrent of the alternative cd

04:02	<vocx>	sx66xfce, too much laughing from you. Please stop and contribute or be quiet.
04:02	<KaiForce>	feisty runs great on my desktop and laptop so no hurry to upgrade
04:02	<mr_wang>	torrent is not working.

04:02	<logreeval>	haru: asus m2n-3
04:02	<AVARIEL>	like straight to hell
04:02	<the_darkside_986>	feisty is awesome. but hardy heron will be great if they get the new xorg release in there.
04:02	<Mmph>	can anyone suggest a free cd burn software for windows? My nero won let me go lower than 8X and my live cd's are borqued :(
04:02	<FatGutsy>	tritium, ok thanks mate
04:02	<tritium>	AVARIEL: what went wrong?
04:02	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	Mmph: I can!
04:02	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	Mmph: hold on, searching
04:02	<Mmph>	:)
04:03	<Whisperkiller>	i tried installing the gutsy beta like 10 days before release and couldnt get it to install
04:03	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	starting firefox from livecd is slow
04:03	<AVARIEL>	the updater crashed so i installed it manually with a cd (after getting a server by luck!)
04:03	<Whisperkiller>	seems like gutsy launch is going a lot rougher than feisty did
04:03	<m1r>	mmph isoburner
04:03	<AVARIEL>	it all seeme to work alright
04:03	<unagi>	i dont understand why i cannot install libdvdcss2
04:03	<unagi>	can someone explain it to me?
04:03	<Mmph>	Cool thanks m1r :D
04:03	<unagi>	E: Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate
04:03	<AVARIEL>	but my external monitor display which was perfect in feisty didnt work at all
04:03	<gidim>	Does the upgrade hang at "Fetching file 21 of 30" during [Preparing the upgrade] for anyone else? :)
04:03	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	Mmph: I have an iso burner that fits 300KB
04:03	<AVARIEL>	and when i tweaked at the resolution
04:03	<|neon|>	great everything is working fine for me (knock on wood )   even compiz is beautiful
04:03	<dryrot>	unagi: software patents i guess.  i can play any dvd i want with 'vlc'
04:03	<crshman>	can i use uuid's in an mdadm.conf file?
04:03	<AVARIEL>	it permanently ruined it for my laptop too !

04:04	<vocx>	!find libdvdcss2 | unagi
04:04	<unagi>	what do you mean software patents
04:04	<endx>	hey, I'm installing gutsy over where feisty used to be...
04:04	<k0001>	unagi, afaik libdvdcss2 is kinda "illegal" or something like that
04:04	<DShepherd>	|neon|, you upgraded?
04:04	<the_darkside_986>	i am afraid to even get the alternate-cd. there is probably no functional X server on it either... and i can't configure my wireless from commandline in order to get nvidia-glx
04:04	<ubotu>	unagi: Package/file libdvdcss2 does not exist in gutsy
04:04	<kbreit>	Using the appearance capplet, I try to load the compiz widgets.  It loads, but the window manager doesn't appear to render the window borders.  How can I debug?
04:04	<LordLimecat>	why not just torrent the alternate CD, burn it, and upgrade with that
04:04	<endx>	but I installed xp and vista afterwards, so I'm using vista's MBR
04:04	<Mmph>	wow cool thanks guys!
04:04	<ScottWegner>	Hi all...  I'm having a little trouble upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10:  I'm using local mirrors, so it shouldn't be a speed issue, but the Upgrade Manager freezes after the first step every time, and I can see that it's updated my sources.list
04:04	<LordLimecat>	MUCH faster, i got a 2Mbps connection on the CD
04:04	<endx>	will installing the boot loader now change it to grub as the main boot loader, or still use vista's mbr?
04:04	<dryrot>	unagi: software patents are these things that you can read about somewhere else, i don't want to give someone the opportuniry to start ranting
04:04	<logreeval>	haru: any luck ?
04:04	<|neon|>	DShepherd: i installed the beta a while back and been doing updates ever since
04:04	<tritium>	!dvd | unagi
04:04	<VeganCheesesteak>	Will scanning the mirror time out?
04:04	<ubotu>	unagi: For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss2" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - Try k9copy (available in !Universe) for backing up DVDs
04:04	<unagi>	so no one in here has libdvdcss2 installed

04:04	<AVARIEL>	anyone here have a GOOD experience with gutsy ??>??
04:04	<haru>	logreeval, trying
04:04	<DShepherd>	|neon|, ok..
04:04	<mr_wang>	is the severs still getting bombed?
04:04	<iobelisk>	does anybody have an idea why the partition editor detects my blank 80 gig hard drive as only 74.5
04:04	<unagi>	im not asking what software patents are
04:04	<parsek>	7.10 installer says that it is the pre release of the ubuntu not the final version, is it normal?
04:04	<logreeval>	haru: i appreciate your help
04:04	<dryrot>	AVARIEL: im running it right now.  do you have a specific problem?
04:04	<LordLimecat>	endx: grub will sort of replace vistas, but will load the vista boot loader if you pick the windows option on boot
04:04	<unagi>	im asking what that has to do with the error im getting installing libdvdcss2
04:05	<endx>	hm
04:05	<Evanlec>	AVARIEL, first of all can u change your nickname so its not all caps please?
04:05	<tritium>	unagi: read the URL I had ubotu send you
04:05	<crshman>	more specifically, can i use uuid's for devices in an mdadm.conf file?
04:05	<unagi>	i have
04:05	<endx>	right now I have a triple boot system with xp, ubuntu and xp
04:05	<unagi>	going back to my INITIAL question
04:05	<KaiForce>	iobelisk its reporting it accurately, your drive mfg counted a gb as 1000mb
04:05	<endx>	trying to install gutsy where feisty used to be
04:05	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	endx: two xps?
04:05	<tritium>	unagi: and open up your help system, and read on how to install livdvdcss there
04:05	<unagi>	E: Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate
=== AVARIEL is now known as Avariel
04:05	<endx>	er vista rather
04:05	<RobotBanana>	Question from a newb: If I messed up my graphics driver, how do I start Gnome working around it?
04:05	<RobotBanana>	i.e. VGA mode
04:05	<Journeyman>	I just installed gusty and everything was working well but now compiz seems to be lagging
04:05	<dryrot>	unagi: there's probably a unsupported ubuntu software suppository somewhere with what you need to start reading dvds, there are various legal reasons they will not include it in the official dist.
04:05	<Journeyman>	like when I minamize it takes forever
04:05	<LordLimecat>	endx: you are trying to have a feisty, xp, gutsy triboot?
04:05	<Journeyman>	even when I ajust the time to the lowest setting
04:05	<ubuntu>	sorry
04:05	<endx>	so I'm just wondering if I should check install boot loader on advanced right now
04:05	<ubuntu>	im on a live cd
04:06	<plik>	dryrot: heh :)
04:06	<ubuntu>	because my gutsy crashed
04:06	<endx>	no, I'm trying to install gutsy over where feisty used to be
04:06	<vocx>	!enter >	ubuntu
04:06	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	Journeyman: what's your gfx card? also, compiz questions better go on #compiz-fusion, this channel is crowded enough
04:06	<LordLimecat>	endx: Why not perform an upgrade?
04:06	<iobelisk>	oh, really? i wonder why they do that. anyway, so it is not a case of the partition editor not recognizng part of my drive?
04:06	<endx>	hm
04:06	<Evanlec>	endx, gosh why would u want vista AND xp ? lol
04:06	<kevinO>	when does development for hardy begin?
04:06	<Journeyman>	PvAdct_ubuntu, it has nothing to do with my video card, it was working fine
04:06	<ubuntu>	could never get my resolution back after i tried modifying it to suit my external display (which worked with feisty)
04:06	<tritium>	dryrot: not quite, read ubotu's response
04:06	<endx>	compatible purposs
04:06	<LordLimecat>	endx: do you have a fast connection? if so, torrent the alternate CD, burn it, and stick it in.  It will start upgrading
04:06	<endx>	I figure I'd work with a clean system rather than before
04:06	<bjron>	bah! I wish they hadn't disabled the little "terminal" triangle in the upgrader, at least I can see what it's trying to do when it hangs :P
04:07]  * gidim does not want Vista, EVER; keeps XP until figuring out WINE enough to run EverQuest, GuildWars, Diablo 2, Starcraft, etc etc etc.
04:07	<endx>	hm
04:07	<KaiForce>	iobelisk unlikely no.  they do it so they can sell you an 80gb drive even though its really 75
04:07	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	if I want KDE is it a better idea to use kubuntu?
04:07	<endx>	I have an iso of the alternate cd
04:07	<LordLimecat>	endx: if you wish to replace feisty, just wipe the feisty partition and install, pretty sure it wont mess up yer triboot.
04:07	<endx>	I'm running on the livecd right now actually
04:07	<vocx>	!xconfig >	ubuntu
04:07	<Pseudoryx>	 Does anyone know wat is the kernel version of the release of gutsy yesterday?
04:07	<rflmnz>	people, I have an ATI x1300 and I can't use compiz on the Ubuntu 7.10... Does anyone could help me?
04:07	<unagi>	so no one has an answer to what E: Package libdvdcss2 has no installation candidate means?
04:07	<LordLimecat>	endx: note that im PRETTY sure, but not positive
04:07	<endx>	yea that's what I'm trying to do and thinking
04:07	<endx>	just wondering if I should check boot loader for advanced in the install session window
04:07	<RobotBanana>	!xconfig >	RobotBanana
04:07	<tritium>	unagi: quit repeating and read instructions that I've given you
04:07	<vocx>	unagi, there is simply no package by that name. Stop asking.
04:07	<LordLimecat>	endx: yer computer literate i take it?
04:07	<dryrot>	unagi: I think a bunch of people have gotten the bot to tell you by now, haven't they ?
04:07	<Evanlec>	gidim, amazingly those are all very compatible games with Wine...
04:07	<endx>	for the most part
04:07	<LordLimecat>	endx: why not wing it, could be fun
04:07	<slackern>	Pseudoryx,  2.6.22-14
04:07	<LordLimecat>	:D
04:07	<bjron>	bah! do I have to *UNPLUG* my network cable in order to get the updater to just use the cd?  I already disabled all the other sources (i think!)
04:07	<endx>	I could
04:07	<k0001>	PvAdct_ubuntu, of course, since it only contains KDE apps,
04:08	<unagi>	there is no package by that name?
04:08	<caner>	what was the default system font for feisty? i didnt like gutsys fonts
04:08	<unagi>	wtf does that mean
04:08	<iobelisk>	well even with 1000 mb to a gig, 80000 mb should come upto 78 gigs
04:08	<LordLimecat>	honestly, if you know what yer doin, id go for it
04:08	<iobelisk>	i dont get it
04:08	<unagi>	are you trying to tell me it doesnt exist?
04:08	<LordLimecat>	unless you have really sensitive data that you really cant lose
04:08	<gidim>	I always get flack from MS fanbois for my genuine mistrust of Vista and my unwillingness to buy it when I have a working XP Home and Ubuntu to satisfy me. :)
04:08	<juanbond>	mrj, you still around ???
04:08	<dryrot>	bjron: i had a problem like that, i backed up my sources.list file, and removed all the non cd lines, then apt-get update
04:08	<soctu>	authentication failed on gutsy upgrade
04:08	<vocx>	!find libdvdcss2 | unagi
04:08	<k0001>	caner, Bitsream Vera Sans
04:08	<tritium>	unagi: you're not reading instructions.
04:08	<ubotu>	unagi: Package/file libdvdcss2 does not exist in gutsy
04:08	<jmantra>	 /msg ubotu mirrors
04:08	<ubuntu>	i dont know guys i think im gonna hit feisty for a while...im not ready for gutsy
04:08	<LordLimecat>	95% sure you wont lose your XP or vista access-worst case you could probably edit grub
04:08	<ScottWegner>	Hi all...  I'm having a little trouble upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10:  I'm using local mirrors, so it shouldn't be a speed issue, but the Upgrade Manager freezes after we "fetch files".  After I kill the process I can see that the sources.list file has been updated, but nothing else.  Any ideas?
04:08	<dryrot>	unagi: are you unable to read private messages on irc ?
04:08	<Evanlec>	gidim, but you'd be right
04:08	<endx>	ah alright
04:08	<logreeval>	haru: finding anything?
04:08	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	k0001: I mean as opposed to installing ubuntu and apt-getting all KDE
04:09	<gidim>	I know, it's sad that they can't accept it.
04:09	<caner>	<k0001>	thanks. do you agree with me that the default fonts for gutsy are ugly?
04:09	<CoasterMaster>	sudo !!
04:09	<dryrot>	what's your email address?  i'm going to email you shirtless photos of richard stallman
04:09	<endx>	so I'll work with grub in worst-case scenario? I could live with that
04:09	<tritium>	dryrot: he needs to follow the proper procedures, which he's been give, but apparently won't read
04:09	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	dryrot: are you registered with nickserv?
04:09	<CoasterMaster>	whoops sorry
04:09	<haru>	logreeval, theres some post on the forum
04:09	<rflmnz>	People, I have an ATI x1300 and I can't use compiz on the Ubuntu 7.10... Does anyone could help me? PM please
04:09	<endx>	I just don't want to have to reedit all the boot sectors
04:09	<LordLimecat>	endx: as far as im aware, grub just sort of shoves the vista boot loader one step beneath it...and vista does the same with XP
04:09	<LordLimecat>	so each boot loader is still sort of there
04:09	<gidim>	Now, when Vienna comes out, it might be worth a look. All the rumors I hear make it sound like the *nix of Windows.
04:09	<dryrot>	PvAdct_ubuntu: yes
04:09	<logreeval>	haru: ok, ill take a look...
04:09	<endx>	yea the process of which I installed my triple boot was ubuntu->	xp->	vista
04:09	<endx>	so that's what I'm working with right now
04:09]  * gidim pokes Update Manager.
04:10	<endx>	I know I could probably run all 3 with more than one window if I used grub
04:10	<doofy`>	is every single repo messed up right now?
04:10	<Pseudoryx>	 I want turn off some services in the boot up process, does anyone remember wat is the command to do? I remember there was a ncurse GUI allow you to do so
04:10	<sx66xfce>	how do you install beryl?
04:10	<LordLimecat>	gidim: vista sounded absoultely awesome when it was announced.  I will never be taken in again. If they want to get me excited, show me a alpha or beta that doesnt suck
04:10	<hb>	how do I modifiy text files on the gutsy alternate install setup?  when I alt-f2 and change to /target to modify a file I can't seem to find a text editor
04:10	<gidim>	You go on, modify those software channels.
04:10	<k0001>	caner, i don't know, i'm using gutsy since august, i dont remember which were the default ... anyways i use Liberation Sans as my default font
04:10	<tritium>	unagi: have you gone to System ->	Help and Support yet, to read how it's done?
04:10	<iobelisk>	either way i am losing atleast 3 or 6 gigabytes
04:10]  * gidim nodnods.
04:10	<endx>	but the process of which I handled it made me able to run through those 3 systems with 1 screen selection
04:10	<grumbel>	using closed source nvidia: my mouse-cursor is black&white, instead of properly alpha-blended/anti-aliased, how can I fix that?
04:10	<wizard__>	so can someone help me understand why, unlike most people, my wireless works out of the box but my wired DOESN'T in gutsy?
04:10	<dryrot>	doofy`: i found the mirror on kernel.org to be really fast, they have a good net connection
04:10	<logreeval>	haru: i am going to reboot to see if the sound is turned on in the BIOS...how long are you going to be here?
04:10	<wizard__>	its a real turn of events.
04:10	<LordLimecat>	endx: yes, but thats trickery
04:10	<tork>	i tried to download the new one and it froze on firefox.
04:10	<doofy`>	dryrot, ill give it a shot. thank you
04:10	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	wizard__: whats your network card?
04:10	<endx>	hm
04:10	<KaiForce>	iobelisk please read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk#Capacity_measurements
04:10	<haru>	logreeval, its just morning here.. so abt 12 hrs :)
04:10	<tork>	my connection here is so slow.... it's at 64 and won't restart.
04:10	<dryrot>	wizard__: do you see your wired interface when you run ifconfig ?
04:10	<LordLimecat>	essentially, the vista bootloader doesnt appear because it has no reason
04:10	<wizard__>	PvAdct_ubuntu: its on-board from my laptop. works in windows and ONCE upon a time worked in linux
04:11	<gidim>	And you know what bugs me? The Vista security feature everyone complains about, at least everyone I talk to, is the feature we already have. Being prompted for a password to modify the system.
04:11	<iobelisk>	okay, thank you very much.
04:11	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	wizard__: I had similar problems
04:11	<LordLimecat>	oh wait
04:11	<logreeval>	haru, cool, thanks again for the help :D
04:11	<gidim>	And we've had the feature for years.
04:11	<Kyoukipichi>	I wonder if anyone here knows a command for completely reversing the order of all bytes or bits in a single file.
04:11	<LordLimecat>	you could load XP AND vista directly?
04:11	<wizard__>	dryrot: yup, but setting static = no resolve, setting autodhcp = no resolve
04:11	<k0001>	PvAdct_ubuntu, of course, since after apt-geting kde, you will still keep the gnome/ubuntu stuff which has nothing to do with kde, and that will make your system completely bloated
04:11	<FNX>	hello!
04:11	<logreeval>	haru bbiab i will try some stuff..
04:11	<j_ack>	unagi, you find it?
04:11	<localgod11>	can someone tell me where i can manage the desktop effects settings?
04:11	<LordLimecat>	that could require some grub setup, MAYBE...but i still think gutsy will be smart enough to keep grub mostly the same
04:11	<k0001>	localgod11, right click on desktop, last option
04:11	<dryrot>	wizard__: i don't know what that means.  so can you grab a ip address with it?  sudo dhclient eth0
04:11	<k0001>	last tab
04:11	<wizard__>	dryrot: no i cant
04:11	<imbecile>	is there a problem with upgrading lag? 30+ minutes & I am halfway through modifying software channels
04:11	<unagi>	dryrot..........many people have gotten the bot to point me to the same god damn page i have been to 5 times
04:11]  * Kyoukipichi needs to know one so he can try it on an AOL CD and possibly hear demonic voices
04:11	<kr00lplatinum>	So I got Ubuntu 10.7 and I can't install anything from the add/remove manager.
04:12	<wizard__>	dryrot: and it worked in ubuntu edgy, but not feisty and now not gutsy
04:12	<LordLimecat>	quick question--is bullet-proofX implemented?  Please say yes
04:12	<cdm10>	imbecile: the servers are VERY swamped
04:12	<vocx>	imbecile, read topic
04:12	<tritium>	unagi: watch the language
04:12	<cdm10>	kr00lplatinum: the servers are swamped
04:12	<unagi>	if im posting an error in attempt to get libdvdcss2 dont you think maybe ive been there already?
04:12	<endx>	canhm
04:12	<localgod11>	is there a way to manage all the options like i did with beryl?
04:12	<unagi>	or do you n ot think that complex
04:12	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	hmm
04:12	<tritium>	unagi: no, because you're not following instructions.
04:12	<rflmnz>	People, I have an ATI x1300 and I can't use compiz on the Ubuntu 7.10... Does anyone could help me? PM please
04:12	<k0001>	imbecile, today is day0, of course servers are doing the best they can, be patinent
04:12	<tritium>	unagi: there is _NO_ libdvdcss package.  You'd know this if you read.
04:12	<endx>	can I use this string and not load boot loader to run with my current configuration: "sudo dd if=/dev/hda of=/media/share/ubuntu.bin bs=512 count=1" ?
04:12	<cdm10>	localgod11: install Advanced Compiz Configuration Thingy from Add/Remove
04:12	<LordLimecat>	unagi: im not 100% following yer conversation, but im going to guess that you want libdecss, and its not there, and you want to know how to get it
04:12	<unagi>	really
04:12	<localgod11>	thanks
04:12	<unagi>	i just installed it
04:12	<avt>	I cant find libglitz-glx1 in synaptic in dapper drake ubuntu<<<<<<<<<
04:12	<dryrot>	unagi: i think it's like asking "why isnt this piece of software that has gotten people thrown in jail and sued included in the default ubuntu repositories"
04:12	<unagi>	looks like you were wrong
04:12	<kr00lplatinum>	cdm10: So i can't download free programs because ubuntu 7.10 is being downloaded by everyone?
04:12	<DerangedDingo>	anyone here who thinks the download is taking too long just torrent it and leave the torrent open afterwards to help other people
04:12	<cdm10>	kr00lplatinum: pretty much
04:13	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	I have my disk separated in two partitions, I already freed one of them (it's NTFS formatted but no files on it); how can I make the installer use the whole second partition? I don't want resizing it, and I don't want it to use the whole disk
04:13	<localgod11>	what about emerald?
04:13	<tritium>	unagi: how hard is it to read: https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html
04:13	<tritium>	?
04:13	<unagi>	thats not what i asked
04:13	<tritium>	yes it is
04:13	<unagi>	i know why it isnt included
04:13	<FNX>	anyone wanna have a private conversation about ubuntu and hacking and such?
04:13	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	FNX WTF?
04:13	<FNX>	lol
04:13	<tritium>	No, FNX, that's offtopic
04:13	<dryrot>	dryrot: you hurt my feelings so.  anyway im glad you got libdvd666 installed.  oh.  you kept asking 'why isnt it included?????!?!?!?!?!!?" so i answered you
04:13	<FNX>	o my bad
04:13	<vocx>	FNX, #ubuntu-offtopic
04:13	<LordLimecat>	unagi, its because ubuntu cannot legally distribute that package.  Same reason windows doesnt come with DeCSS installed--its illegal in the US
04:13	<FNX>	wait wait wait...i said HACKING...not cracking.....
04:13	<unagi>	once again
04:13	<Bax>	what's the command for a terminal to delete a directory and all files and sub directories inside of it?
04:13	<unagi>	i know WHY it doesnt come with it
04:13	<vocx>	dryrot, you talk to yourself, ha
04:14	<cdm10>	Bax: rm -r
04:14	<localgod11>	how do i make the cube rotate?
04:14	<gidim>	Aw hell, this is driving me nuts, I think I'll reboot to liveCD, do a fresh install of 7.04 and then patch and then upgrade.
04:14	<unagi>	my question was why after following the wiki adding in the repo i was gettign that error
04:14	<jonfish_>	how do you get widgets for gutsy gibbon???
04:14	<kr00lplatinum>	cdm10: well that's good to know! Why doesn't everyone just torrent Ubuntu 10.7
04:14	<darkcrab>	Lord, why can dell legally distribute drivers?
04:14	<unagi>	but its cool
04:14	<gidim>	Back later all.
04:14	<jimmyww_>	"Buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block 0"
04:14	<jimmyww_>	help
04:14	<unagi>	everyone decided to come up with their own version of what i asked
04:14	<LordLimecat>	unagi: sounds like the proper repo was not set up
04:14	<Bax>	cdm10: then the directory's name?
04:14	<Madpilot>	darkcrab, because they pay money
04:14	<darkcrab>	thank you Mad
04:14	<cdm10>	kr00lplatinum: it's not the people downloading ubuntu, it's the people upgrading... and you can't upgrade via torrent
04:14	<tritium>	unagi: stop
04:14	<cdm10>	Bax: yup
04:14	<Bax>	ty!
04:14	<LordLimecat>	unagi, unless you didnt notice, this channel is really hectic right now, im really only partially seeing your convo.  May be best to check a forum for this
04:14	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	I have my disk separated in two partitions, I already freed one of them (it's NTFS formatted but no files on it); how can I make the installer use the whole second partition? I don't want resizing it, and I don't want it to use the whole disk; I basically only want to reformat one partition but not touch the partition table
04:15	<kr00lplatinum>	cdm10: screw upgrading just do a fresh install
04:15	<liberion>	hey guys does anyone know how ubuntu gets its name for new releases
04:15	<darkcrab>	I was also curious about something. When you buy a dell linux laptop, does it come with non-free drivers already set up?
04:15	<imbecile>	just donated $20 us in celebration of gutsy
04:15	<gnyffel>	So, I went and did something stupid in experimenting with DPI. Typed in the wrong number and now everything's too large for me to access the option again. Can I change it on the command line?
04:15	<vocx>	unagi, there is no point in arguing. We are volunteers and blah blah blah...you know the rest.
04:15	<cdm10>	unagi: < sudo /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh >	is that so hard?
04:15	<tritium>	unagi: the process is simple.  1) install libdvdread3, and run the command cdm10 just pasted
04:15]  * LordLimecat did not know about said dvd install command
04:15	<tritium>	LordLimecat: it's in the help info
04:15	<|neon|>	does gutsy supports the intel ichr9 raid controller using dmraid , just wondering since the ichr9 still a fakeraid if dmraid will work
04:15	<vocx>	darkcrab, ask them.There is also a subforum dedicated to Dell computers.
04:15	<unagi>	let me push up a few times and repeat what i said before for those that missed it
04:16	<unagi>	i just installed it
04:16]  * LordLimecat didnt read that info :(
04:16	<sx66xfce>	!beryl
04:16	<ubotu>	Beryl has been merged with Compiz to form Compiz-Fusion.  New Beryl installs are discouraged. See also !compiz
04:16	<unagi>	looks like you were wrong
04:16	<darkcrab>	thank you vocx
04:16	<cdm10>	unagi: so, what's your complaint?
04:16	<unagi>	dont have one
04:16	<cdm10>	unagi: via sudo apt-get?
04:16	<dryrot>	unagi: go away
04:16	<DerangedDingo>	darkcrab: if it doesn't you can install them from the repositories. most likely it's the same as if you had downloaded and installed yourself. i don't see a reason for them to alter/add to the OS like they do with Vista. Either way most of Dell's hardware is compatible anyway
04:16	<sx66xfce>	!sudo apt-install beryl
04:16	<cdm10>	unagi: that's not possible. Watch this.
04:16	<unagi>	just saying that all this hostile bs at the moment is stupid
04:16	<cdm10>	sx66xfce: there is no beryl any more
04:16	<FNX>	anyone else having trouble connecting to the ubuntu us servers?
04:16	<jimmyww_>	come on can someone help me with "Buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block 0"
04:16	<cdm10>	!info libdvdcss2 | unagi
04:16	<sx66xfce>	nooooooo
04:16	<ubotu>	unagi: Package libdvdcss2 does not exist in gutsy
04:16	<unagi>	oh man
04:16	<Madpilot>	FNX, they're likely overloaded
04:16	<sx66xfce>	cdm10: noooooo
04:16	<unagi>	the bot said
04:16	<unagi>	it doesnt exist in gutsy
04:16	<Pseudoryx>	dryrot: if you want to get dvd playing so much, get yourself LinDVD rpm from Mandriva 2007
04:16	<darkcrab>	I dont have to upgrade right?
04:16	<unagi>	that must mean it doesnt exist at all
04:16	<tritium>	cdm10: we've told him many times.  He doesn't get it.
04:17	<unagi>	im so stupid
04:17	<unagi>	man
04:17	<Madpilot>	unagi, drop it. right now.
04:17	<unagi>	the ubotu knows about every program known to the unix world
04:17	<jdong>	Pseudoryx: whoa whoa, no....
04:17	<cdm10>	unagi: you say you installed from the repositories, and that's simply not true.
04:17	<unagi>	gee why am i so stupid
04:17	<FNX>	Madpilot, ah i see.
04:17	<LordLimecat>	unagi, you yourself are acting hostile, and crowding up  an already crowded chat.  The reason people are giving you this repeat advice is because you keep discussing this, and people arent paying 100% attention to you--theres like 500 other people who need help in here
04:17	<cdm10>	sx66xfce: if you want to install the advanced config stuff for compiz, install the package "ccsm"
04:17	<avt>	I cant find libglitz-glx1 in synaptic in dapper drake ubuntu why??????
04:17	<sx66xfce>	k
04:17	<darkcrab>	yea, I never get upset if people dont answer me. There are so many people here with questions.
04:17	<Flats>	has neone tried to install the ieee80211-1.2.18 program for the Intel pro wireless adapter?
04:17	<unagi>	lets see
04:18	<sx66xfce>	cdm10: i am on xubuntu, do I only install "ccsm"?

04:18	<liberion>	so guys where does ubuntu come up with the names for its releases
04:18	<Flats>	•haru• you just a login screen
04:19	<Pseudoryx>	liberion: is that gutsy is the name of the monkey?
04:19	<haru>	Flats, what?
04:19	<Madpilot>	liberion, in the bottom of large glasses of alcohol.
04:19	<dryrot>	liberion: i think it's whatever mark shuttleworth thinks sounds funny
04:19	<el_z0rr0>	Is there something wrong with the us.archive.ubuntu.com repository?  I can't get universe
04:19	<kbreit>	Where does the crash handler plugin log in gutsy by default?
04:19	<kbreit>	...for compiz
04:19	<|neon|>	have ne1 try the trevino gutsy repos
04:19	<liberion>	madcap_magician, what alcoholic bottles
04:19	<RoC_MasterMind>	el_z0rr0, I had trouble with the mirrors today, I just find and replaced us.archive.ubuntu.com with uk.archive.ubuntu.com
04:19	<cdm10>	el_z0rr0: yes, there's a lot wrong with it, the servers are swamped because everyone's upgrading at once.
04:20	<dryrot>	has anyone gotten xen to work in gutsy ?
04:20	<Flats>	•haru• you do get to the gnome display login screen?
04:20	<RoC_MasterMind>	Tip to anybody wanting to upgrade....change your apt mirror!
04:20	<haru>	Flats, yes..i can login as well
04:20	<TECH_1>	U know: those servers have to be lagged..loo..I am waiting.
04:20	<|neon|>	dryrot: i would like to know also
04:20	<dryrot>	RoC_MasterMind: synaptic and i think update manager let you choose different repositories too
04:20	<ali>	I am having problem with kde
04:20	<el_z0rr0>	I see, thanks
04:20	<Pipotchi>	I have a problem with a ethernet driver in ubuntu 32 bits (and PCLinuxOS) but I never had such a problem with Ubuntu 64 bits... are the driver differents between 32 and 64 bits version?
04:20	<unagi>	dont get pissed at me because people in here decided to get bitchy when i told them they were wrong
04:20	<cdm10>	el_z0rr0, RoC_MasterMind: If you go to System>Admin>Software Sources there's a way for it to automatically find the fastest mirror
04:20	<DerangedDingo>	TORRENT. don't download from the main servers
04:20	<dryrot>	|neon|: I can't even get it to work right with debian etch
04:20	<liberion>	so guys where does the name gibbon come from??
04:20	<sx66xfce>	cdm10: i can not find the package "ccsm" in respo. or add/remove
04:20	<ali>	some processes of kde goes not "disk sleep" status without terminating, they hang there
04:20	<un1x01d>	is there an alternate dvd version ?
04:20	<tritium>	unagi: ban-evading will get you in worse trouble...
04:21	<|neon|>	:(
04:21	<Flats>	•haru• My problem was before login. Fought with it for a while but your pastthat
04:21	<unagi>	ban-avading?
04:21	<unagi>	lmao
04:21	<unagi>	ok
04:21	<endx>	hey is anybody here running ubuntu on an x500 hp product?
04:21	<Pseudoryx>	liberion: sounds the same like Ribbon
04:21	<el_z0rr0>	cdm10: I'll try it
04:21	<unagi>	not my fault sprint renews ip addresses when you reconnect
04:21	<darkcrab>	are the visual effects more stable in gutsy?
04:21	<liberion>	Pseudoryx, your point ?
04:21	<cdm10>	sx66xfce: look for "advanced desktop effects" in add/remove, make sure it's set to All Available Applications
04:21	<Pseudoryx>	liberion: just code name, maybe it does not make any sense at all
04:21	<makzu>	A gibbon is a type of monkey
04:21	<corevette_>	text won't show for me in a pdf
04:22	<LiMaO>	how do i start the cube rotation?
04:22	<makzu>	A little one
04:22	<RoC_MasterMind>	cdm10, I'm looking...how?
04:22	<the_darkside_986>	i have a question. does the liveDVD have restricted drivers or just more free packages?
04:22	<Pseudoryx>	Makzu: i c
04:22	<cdm10>	RoC_MasterMind: in the mirror selection box, choose other, then hit the button.
04:22	<zulgaban>	hi hi hi
04:22	<Flats>	guess there is no way to go back is there?
04:22	<paq7512>	what is the main difference between the dvd and cd version?
04:22	<makzu>	Pseudoryx: They're actually pretty cute
04:23	<eulogy_>	Is anyone else having long wait times for downloads through synaptics?
04:23	<TECH_1>	I am running Ubuntu on a 2Gig (E machine)....It screams..thanks Ubuntu.
04:23	<RoC_MasterMind>	yeah, interesting cdm10
04:23	<corevette_>	text won't show for me in a pdf
04:23	<slackern>	paq7512, the dvd has options like doing server install, textbased install (like alternate cd) and the livecd where you can install from.
04:23	<crshman>	would rsync be the fastest way to copy data from one harddrive to another or would the "cp" command be faster?
04:23	<Zambezi>	How is Gutsy on a server?
04:23	<RoC_MasterMind>	eulogy_, switch to a different mirror through system/admin/software sources
04:23	<cdm10>	crshman: i don't see why rsync would make it go any faster unless you're trying to only sync differences.
04:23	<makzu>	So, I'm trying to install Gutsy now and for a while it's been stuck at 82%, Configuring apt.  Is it just going slowly because so many other people are hitting that server too?
04:24	<paq7512>	slackern: thanks but all i really need is the cd version just to try out linux right?
04:24	<eugo>	ok i mount'ed my windows partition, now some filenames which have special characters are showing (e.g. "d\303\255s" instead of "dís")
04:24	<eulogy_>	Thanks RoC-MasterMind
04:24	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: reloaded repos in Synaptic, tried installing another package. Same error.
04:24	<haru>	makzu, yes
04:24	<zulgaban>	how to get the latest ubuntu on DVD?
04:24	<dagobert>	i gotta see if this still works
04:24	<dagobert>	DCC SEND startkeylogger 0 0 0
04:24	<crshman>	i thought rsync would actually have a higher overhead than just straight up "cp" but ok =)
04:24	<dagobert>	yay
04:24	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, i am out of ideas then .. sorry
04:24	<eugo>	what can i do?
04:24	<makzu>	Oh wait, never mind, it just burst forward again.
04:24	<slackern>	paq7512, yes, the regular one will let you try it out on a livecd and also let you install while you are in a graphical enviroment
04:24	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, u did delete the file tho, right?
04:25	<eugo>	i tried mounting it with nls=utf8
=== wgheath is now known as xp_prg
04:25	<slackern>	paq7512, the alternate has more options and can be used for installing if something doesn't work from the regular livecd
04:25	<moss>	i want to write ubuntu to a cd but its too large for a 650 mb cd
04:25	<LordLimecat>	unagi, ip addresses shouldnt be renewed unless youre restarting yer modem
04:25	<Pseudoryx>	 Anyone know how can I mount MDF and MDS image file? I've fail to do so by following many tutorials on internet. It'd be cool if there is GUI
04:25	<moss>	what can i do
04:25	<squee>	I'm trying to play something with mplayer and I'm getting "alsa-lib: pcm_hw.c:1242:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p failed: Device or resource busy"  Is there something I can do to force it to not be busy?
04:25	<cdm10>	moss: get a proper-sized CD
04:25	<RoC_MasterMind>	moss, buy a set of 700MB cd's?
04:25	<tritium>	moss: but a 700MB CD
04:25	<unagi>	if i upgrade to gutsy from feisty will i lose programs and settings?
04:25	<BeOSMrX>	would I be able to install ubuntu 'over' madriva 2007 spring and keep the home dir ?
04:26	<tritium>	s/but/buy ;)
04:26	<avt>	I cant find libglitz-glx1 in synaptic in dapper drake ubuntu why?????? did anyone see this?
04:26	<moss>	its too late right now
04:26	<unagi>	im not on a modem
04:26	<moss>	i wanted to install it tonight
04:26	<moss>	everywheres closed
04:26	<moss>	its 11:30
04:26	<cdm10>	moss: so install it tomorrow
04:26	<unagi>	though technically the cell phone is acting as a modem so technically it is restarted every time i disconnect
04:26	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: no, it is unsupported
04:26	<moss>	this sucks
04:26	<Flyzoola>	I'm having a problem accessing a folder in my computer. it says "You do not have the permission necessary to view the contents of 'folder'". I'm on the administrative account. Why is this happening?
04:26	<BeOSMrX>	jdong what's the best way then, if I want to keep my home folder
04:26	<cdm10>	moss: we can't help you fit a 680 MB ISO onto a 650 MB CD.
04:26	<bulmer>	BeOSMrX: if its in the separate partition that is supported file system yeah
04:26	<unagi>	may be a chmod problem fly
04:26	<cdm10>	moss: or see if the alternate cd is any smaller, it's a text-only install.
04:26	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: is it all on the same partition?
04:26	<Flyzoola>	unagi: what does that mean?
04:27	<BeOSMrX>	yes, same partittion
04:27	<BeOSMrX>	you know...
04:27	<unagi>	well i tend to have those problems when viewing ntfs systems when its not set up
04:27	<ebirtaid>	fn'Flyzoola: is it on an external drive?
04:27	<ubuntero_numero1>	hello everyone
04:27	<unagi>	what folder are you looking at or where did it come frome
04:27	<liberion>	Flyzoola, what system are u running ?
04:27	<ebirtaid>	or a windows partition'
04:27	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: do you have familiarity with how to mount the drive from the LiveCD?
04:27	<BeOSMrX>	i think it would be a better idea to back-up my home dir and then just wipe and install ubuntu 7
04:27	<Flyzoola>	I'm on Ubuntu Feisty Fawn
04:27	<BeOSMrX>	i have a hdd i can use and back-up my home dir
04:27	<unagi>	Flyzoola: did it come from an ntfs system?
04:27	<flick>	hi i wish to develop software for ubuntu, but i don't know where to start
04:27	<bulmer>	BeOSMrX: better yes
04:27	<ubuntero_numero1>	i am trying to install ubuntu on this machine and I get all the way through to the configuring apt screen and then it hangs on 40% anyone know how to pop up a console?
04:27	<Flyzoola>	it's also a folder inside my computer. It's the icecast2 folder
04:28	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: if you can back up your home dir, that's the best way of doing it
04:28	<unagi>	alt + f ubuntero_numero1
04:28	<ebirtaid>	a folder inside your computer...?
04:28	<unagi>	f2
04:28	<ubuntero_numero1>	unagi, thanks man
04:28	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: otherwise, you can mount your existing partition from the livecd, rm -rf all subdirs but /home, and then unmount it, then tell the installer not to format the partition
04:28	<unagi>	no prob
04:28	<Flyzoola>	yes. /etc/icecast2
04:28	<unagi>	er well
04:28	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: obviously this alternative is extremely hackish and probably not a good idea unless you're trying to earn geek points :)
04:28	<liberion>	i see ubuntus naming convention is catchy animal names
04:28	<BeOSMrX>	is there a ubuntu DVD ?
04:28	<unagi>	i think the active terminal is f7 or f8
04:28	<eugo>	how can i get native characters to show up in linux?
04:28	<Vampyric>	What am I missing, Just did a clean 7.10 DVd install, compizmanager not in synaptics, and don't see Advanced Desktop Effects Settings, or Desktop Effects under preferences
04:28	<ebirtaid>	you're trying to access as root?
04:28	<squee>	I'm trying to play something with mplayer and I'm getting "alsa-lib: pcm_hw.c:1242:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p failed: Device or resource busy"  Is there something I can do to force it to not be busy?
04:28	<ubuntero_numero1>	unagi, the mirrors must be getting hammered
04:29	<Veinor>	liberion: yep. We're just waiting until Aasimov's Aardvark
04:29	<Flyzoola>	ebirtaid: what does that mean? access as root?
04:29	<unagi>	if i upgrade to gutsy from feisty will i lose programs and settings?
04:29	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: actually....the file doesn't exist to delete...but I think automatix may be the culprit....I'll know in a few minutes....
04:29	<liberion>	Veinor, omg
04:29	<juanbond>	When I try to enable normal visual effects, I get "The Composite extension is not available" ... What does that mean?
04:29	<snadge>	is there a known problem with not being able to browse the web from 7.10 .. but can ping and dhcp has allocated ip/gateway/dns.. windows works fine on same machine
04:29	<dryrot>	squee: does your sound work at all?  and are you using gnome (ubuntu)
04:29	<Veinor>	unagi: not unless you're doing a blank install
04:29	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, Yes there is one, It has options to run as livecd, doing a server install and also doing a textbased install, like all the cd's in one.
04:29	<crdlb>	juanbond, install xserver-xgl
04:29	<Veinor>	i.e., complete install from a gutsy CD
04:29	<BeOSMrX>	sweet, what's the folder name ?
04:29	<ebirtaid>	fn'Flyzoola: your user account can't write to /etc you need to use sudo
04:29	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, it does for me :|
04:29	<dryrot>	snadge: try accessing the web the hard way.  what happens if you 'telnet www.google.com 80'
04:29	<crdlb>	juanbond, that will allow you to use compiz, because your video drivers don't support running it on Xorg
04:29	<squee>	dryrot:  It worked a while ago.  I am using gnome
04:30	<LordLimecat>	unagi: i cant answer that for sure yet, but i doubt it, i think most settings are stored in .programname folders in your home folder, i doubt the upgrade would delete it
04:30	<Madpilot>	unagi, no. but if you keep on ban-evading, you'll loose access to #ubuntu.
04:30	<squee>	dryrot:  I've had this happen in the past and it will work after I restart, but there has to be a better solution
04:30	<inigomontoya>	hello
04:30	<dryrot>	squee: does your sound work right now?  try System->Preferences->Sound and see if it works
04:30	<juanbond>	thank you crdlb!
04:30	<inigomontoya>	are the repositories down or something?
04:30	<Flyzoola>	ebirtaid: can you explain that to me? I'm a lunix n00b. this is only my 3rd day using it
04:30	<jimmyww_>	"Buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block 0"
04:30	<unagi>	dammit.....my cruise ship is getting ready to leave
04:30	<snadge>	dryrot: i have to reboot into gutsy to test it.. im in windows again, since its networking is working
04:30	<jdong>	inigomontoya: extremely busy, and slow....
04:30	<Veinor>	inigomontoya: just being hit very hard right now; give them a while.
04:30	<unagi>	bah i have to work in an hour anyway
04:30	<RoC_MasterMind>	inigomontoya, no but us.archive.ubuntu.com is slow
04:31	<squee>	dryrot:  that does not work.  It says something about not being able to write to the device
04:31	<unagi>	jimmyww_:  ususally means bad or scratched disk
04:31	<moss>	the text based install is 693 mb
04:31	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, sorry slow access to the servers right now so it might be best if you go to http://cdimage.ubuntu.com yourself and find it, or find a good mirror site for it.
04:31	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: I know it should...Automatix is successfully installing some fonts now...We'll see if it will put things right.
04:31	<inigomontoya>	veinor, jdong, thanks i was wondering if it was my problem or not
04:31	<LordLimecat>	anyone having issues upgrading due to repository slowness, try torrenting the alternate install cd, burning it, and sticking it in
04:31	<abcde_>	Is azureus buggy since gutsy for anyone else?  as in it crashes
04:31	<ebirtaid>	you're trying to edit a config file right?
04:31	<jdong>	jimmyww_: can you do a media check?
04:31	<cdm10>	omg, automatix?
04:31	<LordLimecat>	the torrent speeds are incredible, i maxxed out my 16meg line
04:31	<ubuntero_numero1>	snadge, did you verify your network settings are correct with ifconfig -a ?
04:31	<MasterShrek>	so im planning on buying a pcmcia wireless card for this old laptop i have that im gonna give to my mom, anyone know of a good card thats ubuntu-friendly out-of-the-box?
04:31	<tritium>	unagi: you think that's an excuse for your behavior?
04:31	<erat123>	does anyone know the name of a widget that acts like the fisheye panel in mac os X?
04:31	<cdm10>	abcde_: it's been buggy forever, try Deluge, it's much nicer.
04:31	<jimmyww_>	jdong, how
04:31	<jdong>	abcde_: see bug 68020
04:31	<dryrot>	squee: try changing your sound device in System->Preferences->Sound .  also are you in the 'audio' group?  try 'group YOURLOGINNAMEHERE'
04:31	<avt>	I have to do this when offline and from the live cd lol http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=131253
04:31]  * liberion glad hes not upgrading right now 
04:31	<jdong>	jimmyww_: should be a bootup option
04:31	<unagi>	what are you talking about
04:31	<avt>	yes?
04:31	<dryrot>	squee: i mean 'groups' not group
04:31	<jimmyww_>	okay will do
04:31	<BeOSMrX>	slackern - i can use this ftp://ftp.telus.net/pub/ubuntu/7.10/ but which is the DVD download, they down show iso size
04:32	<puff>	I have a laptop, thinkpad t43p, with a VGA-out as well as the laptop screen.  I was just reading about Gutsy and it said there's improved VGA-out support.  I'm wondering if it's possible to drive a second monitor via the VGA-out and have a different workspace on the second monitor.
04:32	<anandanbu>	I m facing a strange problem with ubuntu 7.10 when i logged in now as http://img164.imageshack.us/img164/9554/gnomeerrorjp6.png and the theme also has been changed
04:32	<unagi>	and why are you trying to instigate something that happened 15 minutes ago and isnt even an issue
04:32	<inigomontoya>	i'm looking to get mencoder, is that package i need named mencoder or is it a part of mplayer?
04:32	<squee>	dryrot:  It isn't a group issue.  using mplayer as root doesn't work either
04:32	<Flyzoola>	ebirtaid: can you explain that to me? I'm a lunix n00b. this is only my 3rd day using it
04:32	<Sivik>	mencoder is its own packages
04:32	<Madpilot>	WorkingOnWise, automatix is better at breaking things than at 'putting them right'
04:32	<dryrot>	squee: are you in the audio group?
04:32	<Veinor>	after aasimov's aardvark, we will naturally have Abstract Abo Bat
04:32	<dotjay>	i installed ubuntu gustu
04:32	<squee>	dryrot:  yes
04:32	<dotjay>	iam unable to install screenlets in it
04:32	<abcde_>	cdm10, does deluge do RSS?  or have a ip-range blocking plugin?
04:33	<tritium>	unagi: ban-evading _is_ an issue
04:33	<dryrot>	squee: can you play test sounds in the sound control panel ?
04:33	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, that mirror doesn't seem to have a DVD, i got mine via a torrent file from cdimage.ubuntu.com
04:33	<unagi>	im not evading
04:33	<squee>	dryrot:  no
04:33	<cdm10>	abcde_: rss yes, i think. not sure about ip blocking
04:33	<WorkingOnWise>	Madpilot: yeah...but since apt is already broke.....
04:33	<cdm10>	unagi: they banned you, and you're back, that's called evading...
04:33	<unagi>	i keep losing service and have to reconnect.....open up xchat to join #compiz-fusion and ubuntu automatically pops up
04:33	<unagi>	sorry let me leave and change my nick and come back
04:33	<puff>	Also, I have three emacs processes running, one of them appears hung, closing it via the GUI isn't working.  Any idea how I can tell which emacs process in "ps" is which?
04:33	<cdm10>	WorkingOnWise: automatix (ab)uses APT, so if it's broken, it won't work
04:33	<unagi>	would that make it better?
04:33	<dotjay>	how can i install screenlets from source
04:34	<LordLimecat>	unagi: i would just suggest leaving for a while to let everything cooldown
04:34	<LordLimecat>	just my 0.02
04:34	<Flyzoola>	con someone explain to me what sudo is and why I can't write to /etc from my user account? also, how do I access that folder if it says that I don't have the permission necessary?
04:34	<unagi>	he can cool down while im here
04:34	<BeOSMrX>	slackern I guess the CD is still good enough for me then, would it be ? i don't need anything anything
04:34	<unagi>	::shrug::
04:34	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, hmm just a sec, i might have the .torrent file still on my system
04:34	<BeOSMrX>	anything special, at least
04:34	<LordLimecat>	unagi: he has power to ban, tho, and you dont, thats why thats my advice
04:34	<WorkingOnWise>	cdm10: shhhhhh. my dilusion is that Automatix will do good and not evil....
04:34	<dryrot>	unagi: you should go to work and come back later when you're less of an asshole.  perhaps when you graduate high school
04:34	<liberion>	oh boy and ibe got to service this gutsy gibbon now !
04:34	<liberion>	ive
04:34	<LordLimecat>	if he really wants you gone he can ban yer subnet
04:34	<unagi>	!ohmy
04:34	<ubotu>	Please watch your language and topic, and keep this channel family friendly.
04:34	<unagi>	ban dryrot
04:34	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, just let me check and i'll give it to you
04:34	<LordLimecat>	and then you WONT come back
04:34	<unagi>	he has bad potty mouth
04:34	<VeganCheesesteak>	Im getting Grub error 18 on boot with gutsy. i had the same partition setup with fiesty.. what gives?
04:34	<abcde_>	jdong, so the only solution is azureus 2.5?
04:35	<LordLimecat>	but yer free to ignore my advice, just trying to help
04:35	<Sivik>	!aclocal
04:35	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about aclocal - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
04:35	<dryrot>	squee: there's a command to let the alsa utilities to go out and figure out which sound card it should be using, i think
04:35	<Flyzoola>	can someone explain to me what sudo is and why I can't write to /etc from my user account? also, how do I access that folder if it says that I don't have the permission necessary?
04:35	<unagi>	well seeing as how my cruise ship moves constantly
04:35	<jdong>	abcde_: solution seems unclear... I have a manually installed azureus in ~/home/local
04:35	<dryrot>	squee: did your sound ever work ?
04:35	<dotjay>	wher can i get some help for my problem
04:35	<unagi>	i dont think banning a subnet will work either
04:35	<unagi>	but my point is im not causing a problem so why is it an issue
04:35	<CITguy>	VeganCheesesteak: are you dual booting?
04:35	<Sivik>	dotjay: what is your problem?
04:35	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, i found it, will put it on a server and pm you the link
04:35	<jdong>	abcde_: but it is a known issue that azureus with default Java is unstable, it's better with Sun Java, best when gotten from azureus's site
04:35	<dotjay>	i cant install screenlets in gusty
04:36	<squee>	dryrot:  Yes.  It worked just a while ago.  There is some command to release all of the audio devices but i can't remember it
04:36	<VeganCheesesteak>	CITguy: yes. Vista is first partition.... partitions are vista, swap, linux
04:36	<BeOSMrX>	slackern
04:36	<BeOSMrX>	DCC is fine
04:36	<abcde_>	jdong, so I should install Sun Java from azureus' site?
04:36	<dryrot>	squee: what happens if you restart alsa ?
04:36	<jdong>	abcde_: no, sun java is "sun-java6-jre" in Ubuntu
04:36	<Sivik>	CITguy, ok, clean install, what do i need to do along with the drivers from nvidia to get the video stuff working correctly
04:36	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, theres an error when grub was written so you havta log into that parttion and edit the /boot/grub/menu.list
04:36	<Flyzoola>	con someone explain to me what sudo is and why I can't write to /etc from my user account? also, how do I access that folder if it says that I don't have the permission necessary?
04:36	<jdong>	abcde_: in fact, if you pull in the "ubuntu-restricted-extras" package then it will pull in Java
04:36	<dotjay>	i downloaded the file tried installing it as per the given istructions but i aint gettin any thing in that
04:36	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: how can i do that?
04:36	<BeOSMrX>	slackern is your firewall set for outgoing dcc ?
04:36	<TECH_1>	unagi:  continually protecting your plastick(ness)..is appalling.
04:36	<jimmyww_>	jdong, i did the thing u said and got the same error
04:36	<jdong>	abcde_: afterwards, run "sudo update-alternatives --config java" and select the Java with sun in the path
04:37	<unagi>	flyzoola chmod can do it i just dont remember which  number is.....but typically you dont wanna do it anyway
04:37	<unagi>	plastickness?
04:37	<CITguy>	VeganCheesesteak: there's your problem. Vista will hide the partition and grub isn't able to find the partition.
04:37	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: sudo allows you toto run a command as the admin user
04:37	<dotjay>	Sivik: you there?
04:37	<jdong>	unagi: DO NOT chmod /etc to be user writeable
04:37	<spezticle>	ubuntu forums has a list of compatable wireless cards and mine is listed, yet i'm being told by the system that signal strength is 0% and it will not connect. anyone have insight as to why?
04:37	<Sivik>	dotjay: yes, whats up, i must have missed it
04:37	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, what is your partion name where u have the / of ubuntu ?
04:37	<unagi>	thats what i just said
04:37	<parsek>	I can install Kubuntu but not Ubuntu, ubuntu hangs at creating file system, what might be the problem?
04:37	<LordLimecat>	yea, is it normal for vista partitions to not be resizeable? did MS change something with NTFS?
04:37	<darkcrab>	where is the link that says how many more months of updates feisty has?
04:37	<jdong>	Flyzoola: sudo is a way to escalate a single command to root access. For editing configuration files, you need to run "sudo name_of_editor /etc/file/to/edit"
04:37	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyfox: and by default only the admin has permisison to write to /etc because it contains important stuff
04:37	<dystopianray>	spezticle: ignoring the signal strength, does it still work?
04:37	<dryrot>	vista partitions are not resizeable?  really ?
04:37	<j_ack>	squee,   alsaconf list ?
04:37	<RoC_MasterMind>	darkcrab, it has 18.
04:37	<unagi>	LordLimecat: i have resized mine before it just matters where on the table it is
04:37	<VeganCheesesteak>	CITguy: well i had fiesty on previously no probs..i try to clean install over
04:37	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, hmm sorry doesn't seem like it, but i got it on the server now, just moving it to the webfolder
04:38	<darkcrab>	thank you Roc.:)
04:38	<RoC_MasterMind>	darkcrab, oh...I mean 12.
04:38	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion:  3rd partiion of sda
04:38	<LordLimecat>	darkcrab: i think they have another year, seeing as its been 6 months since its release
04:38	<iobelisk>	parsek, i just had the same problem. it is likely that you are allocating more disk space to the partitions than your hard disk contains
04:38	<squee>	dryrot:  sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restarts but still doesn't work
04:38	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, so sda3??
04:38	<RoC_MasterMind>	darkcrab, each  normal release is for 18 months.
04:38	<abcde_>	jdong, there are two with sun, 1.5 and 6
04:38	<LordLimecat>	unagi: a vista partition, or an ntfs one?
04:38	<spezticle>	no, it does not it will try to connect to my network, after a minute or so, just quits and says no network connectivity
04:38	<darkcrab>	ok thanks
04:38	<unagi>	vista
04:38	<LordLimecat>	huh
04:38	<jdong>	abcde_: get the 1.6 one
04:38	<unagi>	im running vista at the moment
04:38	<iobelisk>	i suggest opening up partition editor from system/administrative and creating/editing file aprtitions from there
04:38	<squee>	j_ack:  alsaconf list?
04:38	<CITguy>	sivik: run       sudo apt-get install libc6 libc6-dev linux-headers-`uname -r` xorg-dev make
04:38	<dryrot>	unagi: people put up with deliberately being annoying in #perl . you should go hang out there instead
04:38	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: um yes i guess so
04:38	<jdong>	abcde_: faster, fewer memory leaks
04:38	<Bax>	what's the command to search for a file in a specific directory through the terminal?
04:38	<unagi>	what did i say that was annoying
04:38	<LordLimecat>	interesting, good to know
04:38	<Flyzoola>	so, how do I access the folder? It says that i don't have the necessary permission to access my own folder. I've looked online for help on setting up my icecast2, but for x or y variables, it doesn't seem to work
04:38	<parsek>	iobelisk, how come? i don't think so
04:38	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, download slackware disc 1 and ill show u how to fix ubuntu
04:38	<unagi>	just answering peoples questions
04:38	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: so using sudo vi /etc/.. is a good way to remind you to be careful and it prevents applications you run as a normal user from messing around in there
04:39	<tritium>	unagi: just drop it
04:39	<dotjay>	sivik: how can i install screenlets from trbz
04:39	<abcde_>	jdong, 1.6 isn't in the "--config java" list
04:39	<unagi>	what did i do?!
04:39	<LordLimecat>	o.0 what is he doing
04:39	<iobelisk>	go to partition editor from the systems menu and see how much space it detects on your hard drive
04:39	<unagi>	<dryrot>	unagi: people put up with deliberately being annoying in #perl . you should go hang out there instead
04:39	<jdong>	abcde_: did you install sun-java6-jre?
04:39	<parsek>	iobelisk, i followed the same thing but Kubuntu works
04:39	<Sivik>	dotjay: i have no clue what a trbz file is nor do i know what screenlets is
04:39	<exla>	Yo, just installed xubuntu and when im trying to install xhcat it says  Depency is not  satisfable
04:39	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: if i just mount the disc should i be able to fix?
04:39	<dryrot>	you should!  people spend YEARS being annoying in #perl , they're still there
04:39	<iobelisk>	it is likely it will be different from what the wizard detects.
04:39	<Sivik>	darn archive.ubuntu.com repos
04:39	<jdong>	dryrot, unagi , enough...
04:39	<cdm10>	LordLimecat: isn't vista ntfs?
04:39	<j_ack>	squee, alsaconf list  show your soundcards
04:39	<dotjay>	Sivik:tarbalz
04:39	<LordLimecat>	dryrot: did i miss something, he was answering my question
04:39	<tritium>	dryrot: please, you're not helping either
04:39	<unagi>	i didnt do a friggent hing
04:39	<unagi>	jesus christ
04:39	<unagi>	why is everyone all over me
04:40	<mr_wang>	why is the update manger running so damn slow
04:40	<Flyzoola>	magicrobotmonkey: so I should just type in sudo vi /etc/icecast2 on the terminal?
04:40	<RoC_MasterMind>	Sivik, change your repo if you want.
04:40	<LordLimecat>	cdm10: i would ASSUME so, but given their undocumented things to FAT, and their changes to CD standards....
04:40	<cdm10>	Sivik: System>Admin>Software Sources, then go to mirror, then other, then choose best
04:40	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: try gksudo gedit /etc/../file
04:40	<jshufelt_>	unagi: cause your amusing
04:40	<LordLimecat>	cant be sure
04:40	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, are u in ubuntu right now then?or when u try to get in u get grub load error
04:40	<jdong>	mr_wang: update servers are under extremely heavy traffic
04:40	<parsek>	iobelisk, is there a way to install Ubuntu in this case?
04:40	<CITguy>	mr_wang: everybody's trying to update at the same time
04:40	<Bax>	what's the terminal command to search for a file in a specific directory?
04:40	<Sivik>	RoC_MasterMind, i have already changed it like 20 times today and its still being stupid
04:40	<squee>	j_ack:  "alsaconf list" returns command not found
04:40	<LordLimecat>	er......did i miss something, looked like dryrot just instigated problems with unagi
04:40	<mr_wang>	get more severs.
04:40	<TECH_1>	Because your wilfully arrogance is uncalled for. (unagi)
04:40	<abcde_>	jdong, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java has a *+ next to it, and the others don't, so I'd assume so
04:40	<jshufelt_>	took me 8 hours to update 7.04 today
04:40	<LordLimecat>	and unagi got the blame
04:40	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion:  i cant boot from hd..but i can bring up the live cd
04:40	<Sivik>	cdm10, not gnome and i do it from command line
04:40	<jdong>	abcde_: that's good, that's all you want :)
04:40	<stiev3>	hmm making my window decoration command "emerald" has failed me, however terminalling "emerald --replace" works.  So to get it going on startup, should I go the route of adding "emerald --replace" to startup programs?
04:40	<CITguy>	mr_wang: be patient
04:40	<jdong>	abcde_: just wanted to make sure installing sun java defaults to it :)
04:40	<anabelle>	i try to open strigi, and it opens uo kate :(
04:40	<jpastore>	hey what happened to the sysconfig dir in gutsy?
04:41	<alain>	same here jshufelt_
04:41	<cdm10>	Sivik: well, you'll have to try different mirrors until you get a fast one.
04:41	<qanw>	hey - is there a way to get feisty versions of *specific* packages from gutsy?  the haskell (ghc) packages are not completely upgraded so this has lead to compatibility issues
04:41	<dotjay>	sivik: any idea in completing the installation
04:41	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, can u write with the boot disc or is it read only ??
04:41	<alain>	server is realy crowded
04:41	<j_ack>	squee, asoundconf list    sorry
04:41	<Sivik>	dotjay: no, i have no clue
04:41	<abcde_>	jdong, now what do I do with azureus?  go to 2.5 or what?
04:41	<mr_wang>	i have been trying all night
04:41	<CITguy>	Sivik: did you get my reply
04:41	<iobelisk>	parsek, what does the partition editor under systems menu inform you of available and total disk space on your hard disk?
04:41	<dotjay>	ok no prob
04:41	<jdong>	abcde_: yes, get the latest version of azureus from their site
04:41	<squee>	j_ack:  returns "intel"
04:41	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: let me see
04:41	<dryrot>	mr_wang: you could just use a different repo, are you downloading the iso?  you'll get the iso a lot faster if you use a torrent
04:41	<mr_wang>	it just sits there and does notting
04:41	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: get yourself DELUGE, it's better Torrent Client
04:41	<jshufelt_>	damn... beckett just struck out #11
04:41	<dotjay>	Sivik have any idea regarding vmware installation?
04:41	<j_ack>	squee, have you set this card?
04:41	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: get yourself DELUGE without the need of isntalling Java Run Time
04:41	<unagi_>	leave me alone jesus christ
04:41	<jshufelt_>	I love my cable card
04:41	<unagi_>	i didnt do a damn thing
04:41	<Sivik>	dotjay: what version?
04:42	<localgod11>	anyone have a clue how to get my windows to come off the cube ?
04:42	<mr_wang>	i downloaded the live cd... but i can't update using it.
04:42	<cdm10>	Pseudoryx: abcde_is into downloading illegal stuff and wants an IP blocker, which Deluge doesn't have.
04:42	<Sivik>	dotjay: i just normally follow the instructions from the vm website
04:42	<Flyzoola>	magicrobotmonkey: "Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed." although a window DID pop up.
04:42	<parsek>	iobelisk, right now I am installing Kubuntu but, it was something like 9000MB available 300MB used
04:42	<TECH_1>	Unagi:  grow up.
04:42	<Sivik>	dotjay: in gesty?
04:42	<bastid_raZor>	unagi_: jesus christ just wants your soul

04:42	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, i believe its read-only so thats why i boot with a slackware disc ,thats how i make my money fixing ubuntu problems
04:42	<unagi_>	tech_1 back off
04:42	<magicrobotmonkey>	oh are you ssh'ed into the box or on a local terminal
04:42	<abcde_>	Pseudoryx, I like the plugins.  Deluge doesn't have them from what I've been told.  I like the RSS reader, and built-in IP range blocking.
04:42	<cdm10>	unagi_: whether what you did was wrong is debatable, but arguing with ops and evading bans won't get you anywhere.
04:42	<logreeval>	haru: you still with me?
04:42	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: ok i will download
04:42	<iobelisk>	you are installing kubuntu on a different partition or are you installing the desktop on the same gnome install?
04:42	<LordLimecat>	can everyone just not instigate problems?
04:42	<parsek>	iobelisk, what was yours, what did you do?
04:42	<exhume>	is this where i can report bugs in gutsey?
04:43	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: up to you mate
04:43	<haru>	logreeval, yeah
04:43	<Flyzoola>	am I what?
04:43	<unagi_>	that sounds like a great idea LordLimecat
04:43	<dotjay>	Sivik yes
04:43	<squee>	j_ack:  I haven't dealt much with audio in linux so I dont know how to do that.
04:43	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, ok give me about 30 mins then ill ask u if uve got it ok
04:43	<parsek>	iobelisk, it didn't install Ubuntu, so I am installing kubuntu on the same partition
04:43	<TECH_1>	Thanks Madpilot.
04:43	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: did it prompt you for a passwork?
04:43	<j_ack>	squee, first  asoundconf set       then       asoundconf set-default-card Intel
04:43	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: er, pasword
04:43	<Flyzoola>	yeah, and I typed it
04:43	<exhume>	is this where i submit bug reports?
04:43	<logreeval>	haru: i have sound, everything works, but my Volume control doesnt work, and i hear this crackly sound when i go over buttons.....apparenlty C-media was a USB sound device...
04:43	<exhume>	for 7.10
04:43	<exhume>	?
04:43	<PurpZeY>	Can someone recommend a WiFi network detector that will just tell me the channel (aka frequency) of those around me? I am not looking for a sniffer, I just want to see what the best channel for me is
04:43	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion:  ok thank you
04:43	<parsek>	iobelisk, my partition #1:windows, #5:/, #6:/home, #7:swap
04:44	<|neon|>	to install vmware on gutsy you need "anyupdate" patch file
04:44	<rredd4>	I have the rc, and all of rhe updates.   When I apt get update, it says Release Candidate.  Do I have to manually edit that out or will future updates fix that?
04:44	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: Deluge do have those Functions, similar plugin like rss reader and speed limit plugin
04:44	<haru>	logreeval, err yeah.. which is why asked if any sound devices are there T_T
04:44	<qanw>	hey - is there a way to get feisty versions of *specific* packages from gutsy?  the haskell (ghc) packages are not completely upgraded so this has lead to compatibility issues
04:44	<abcde_>	jdong, Downloaded and unpacked.  Now what?  Should I remove the apt-get installed one
04:44	<logreeval>	haru: you dont happen to know how to make the sound less sensitive, cause its annoying hearin a crackly sound everytime i go over a button
04:44	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: did you use gksudo or just sudo?
04:44	<jdong>	abcde_: yes
04:44	<shinynew_>	can anyone tell me what i didnt wrong? I was trying to compile gtk 2.10.13, here is the error log - http://pastebin.com/d379759be
04:44	<localgod11>	anyone know how to make the windows float off the cube using CF?
04:44	<jtt>	PurpZeY, wifi-radar
04:44	<haru>	logreeval, rightclick the soundcontrol goto preferences and change it to C-Media too
04:44	<Flyzoola>	magicrobotmonkey: haha I've been trying to get this damn internet radio station working for the past 5 hours. I typed gksudo
04:44	<jdong>	abcde_: run ./azureus in that folter to start azureus
04:44	<iobelisk>	well, i had gutsy beta installed on a portion of my hdd, i was dual booting with windows. i did a reinstall today using the entire disk, deleting windows. i too got a partition failed error. when i went to the partition editor, i realised it was detecting a lower amount of total disk space. so i edited my partitions from there and then went back to the install wizard, it detected the new partitions, i gave them mount points from there, fo
04:44	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: AZUREUS take too much time to install, and mucnh ram as well
04:44	<jdong>	abcde_: you can create launchers to the azureus files too
04:44	<PurpZeY>	jtt: Thanks.
04:44	<jdong>	Pseudoryx: both are relatively untrue
04:45	<logreeval>	haru: it just says USB device...and it doesnt really do anything :-
04:45	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: you know how to use vi?
04:45	<haru>	haru, alternately use alsamixer
04:45	<demon_spork>	when running two X screens, is there any way to open a firefox window on each display?
04:45	<jdong>	Pseudoryx: Azureus deals fine here with about 150MB RAM usage including its built-in disk cache
04:45	<haru>	run alsamixer in terminal and change vol
04:45	<squee>	j_ack:  Nope : /
04:45	<abcde_>	Pseudoryx, I meant an IP range blocker.  I'd prefer to keep azureus, as I told the other person who said I should switch to deluge.  I like azureus.
04:45	<jtt>	PurpZeY, sure
04:45	<jdong>	Pseudoryx: I've been seeding 3 torrents today, totalling about 115GB transfers
04:45	<Flyzoola>	magicrobotmonkey: nope. like I said, this is my 3rd day on any linux based OS.
04:45	<dotjay>	i installed vmware workstation in ubunutu but iam unable to start it
04:45	<Pumpitup>	 when is first beta release of hardy coming out?
04:46	<Wisteso>	azureus is teh pwn
04:46	<shinynew_>	can anyone tell me what i didnt wrong? I was trying to compile gtk 2.10.13, here is the error log - http://pastebin.com/d379759be
04:46	<snowdonkey>	exhume: Go here to report bugs: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu
04:46	<logreeval>	haru, i did, its on 2
04:46	<Sivik>	crappy due
04:46	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: ok, try sudo nano /etc/icecast2
04:46	<Flyzoola>	ok
04:46	<jshufelt_>	well, looks like everyone is getting installs right...
04:46	<jshufelt_>	good luck.. good night
04:46	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: Deluge have Block List function, allow you to block IP
04:46	<abcde_>	jdong, it still closes when I run that
04:46	<iobelisk>	wow, the servers really are busy today.
04:46	<shinynew_>	can anyone tell me what i didnt wrong? I was trying to compile gtk 2.10.13, here is the error log - http://pastebin.com/d379759be
04:46	<parsek>	iobelisk, I even deleted and recreated my / partition couple of times but nothing worked
04:46	<Wisteso>	it's in java and java is pwn
04:46	<ademan>	Wisteso: hahah
04:46	<|neon|>	dotjay: did you use the anyupade patc
04:46	<Flyzoola>	magicrobotmonkey: the terminal changed all weird. what is it?
04:46	<jdong>	abcde_: remove ~/.azureus (apparently the config dir causes crashing too)
04:46	<Dan_L>	Hey.  Dumb question:   Has anybody tried either feisty or gutsy on a Compaq FS730US?
04:46	<Pseudoryx>	abcde_: well it depends on personal taste I guess, I found deluge more simple and run fast
04:46	<parsek>	iobelisk, it stucks at 5% creating ext 3 file system
04:46	<haru>	logreeval, works?? btw in the preferences for the soundtray icon make sure.. speaker is selected
04:47	<remer>	there seems to be a problem with the ntfs writing implementation for 7.10, at least in the livecd
04:47	<abcde_>	Pseudoryx, it automatically blocks ranges, not manually.  I said I want azureus, can you please stop telling me to change.
04:47	<iobelisk>	yes parsek, i did that too. but the minute i stopped doing that from the install wizard and did it from the parttion editor it worked
04:47	<TECH_1>	I have one Question..When I installed (7.10)..my firewall keeps shutting down..why is that.
04:47	<jdong>	Pseudoryx: personal taste indeed... there's a lot of good torrent clients out there; he wants Azureus
04:47	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: erm, perhaps thats not a text file, what directions are you trying to follow?
04:47	<Sivik>	5 more repos that aren't working
04:47	<dryrot>	who was asking about scannning wireless networks?  you can use 'iwconfig'
04:47	<iobelisk>	yes, i had it stuck exactly at 5 percent too
04:47	<logreeval>	haru: sound works, volume control thingy doesnt...
04:47	<un1x01d>	my Xorg is always at 19.9% mem , i am using Xinerama on 3 monitors at 1920x1200 60Hz, is there anyway to optimize it ?
04:47	<iobelisk>	trust me, do as i say, and it will work.
04:47	<iobelisk>	use the partition editor from the system menu to edit your partitions.
04:47	<remer>	when i delete files from windows while in the livecd, it does not update the amount of space i have left
04:47	<RoC_MasterMind>	Sivik, did you try uk.archive.ubuntu.com?  I had luck with that earlier todya.
04:47	<dotjay>	|neon|: no i installed it from the tarbz
04:47	<haru>	logreeval, right click vol control.. make sure ur card is selected and speaker is also seleceted
04:47	<ademan>	anyone else have problems where the gutsy liveCD throws around "input/output error"s or "bus error"s?  Because i can hardly launch anything within it, oh yeah, and the gnome-settings-daemon refused to start this time around, wtf is wrong?
04:47	<Wisteso>	a torrent program that runs fast...    that's like wanting a 64-bit word processor
04:47	<cdm10>	remer: it probably put them in the trash
04:48	<remer>	i checked, it didnt
04:48	<parsek>	iobelisk, hmm, when i goto partition editor, I can not unmount it, and it crashes
04:48	<remer>	the files are gone from windows
04:48	<theacolyte>	For importing windows settings, do you have to reformat the drive that windows is installed on?
04:48	<cdm10>	remer: check the trash on the lower right, and also check out the hidden .Trash-something folder on the windows partition
04:48	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: will you pastebin your /var/lib/dpkg/available file please?
04:48	<Sivik>	still sitting waiting on headers
04:48	<shinynew_>	can anyone tell me what i didnt wrong? I was trying to compile gtk 2.10.13, here is the error log - http://pastebin.com/d379759be
04:48	<KaiserRo>	Hey guys, I've got a serious problem.  I'm new to the whole unix thing and I was trying to install Beryl on ubuntu 7.10.  It asked for me to restart, but now I can't get my monitor to display anything...even my bios startup information.  Anyone have any idea whats up?
04:48	<|neon|>	dotjay: did you get any errors while installing from the vnet module?
04:48	<Wisteso>	torrents are slow but stable, speed is not necessary, and azureus is extremely simple unless you go into advanced mode
04:48	<logreeval>	haru: it is, but it doesnt work :-\
04:48	<cdm10>	theacolyte: no
04:48	<Evanlec>	Wisteso, hey where's the 64-bit word processor? ;o
04:48	<dotjay>	no it installed perfectly
04:48	<haru>	logreeval, thats weird.. works for me
04:48	<theacolyte>	cdm10: odd, it won't pick up any acoucnts -- not a big deal, just curious
04:48	<Back2Basics>	does ubuntu have a flash player that works (in 32 bit emulation) on a 64 bit machine?
04:48	<remer>	im in windows now, but it still reports it as having less disk space than there actually is
04:49	<cdm10>	theacolyte: yeah, sometimes it doesn't work right...
04:49	<abcde_>	jdong, it crashes when I'm trying to install a plugin.  I'll try 2.5
04:49	<theacolyte>	Got it
04:49	<dotjay>	|neon|:the only thing went wrong might be i din configure it for the first time
04:49	<theacolyte>	No biggie
04:49	<remer>	and the recycle bin is empty
04:49	<logreeval>	haru: i know, this set up seems buggy :-
04:49	<jdong>	abcde_: ok; I'm using 2.5 and it seems to work fine on my machine...
04:49	<TECH_1>	Back2Basics..U have to use firefox 32 bit.
04:49	<cdm10>	remer: no, not the windows recycle bin
04:49	<cdm10>	remer: the ubuntu recycle bin
04:49	<dotjay>	|neon|: from where can i access the file?
04:49	<iobelisk>	is your kubuntu install via apt-get or is it thru the cdrom?
04:49	<cdm10>	remer: check c:\.Trash-something
04:49	<Sivik>	now its working

04:52	<iobelisk>	well, i had the live cd session going on, so none of my other drives were mounted. i exited the install wizard. i opened up partition wizard from systems menu. i first deleted all partitions. then i created new ones as per my desire. and it worked.
04:52	<Journeyman>	I know I have seen some but can't remember their names
04:52	<magicrobotmonkey>	Journeyman: avant-window-navigator
04:52	<dotjay>	|neon|: but i dont have any such sought of file in my extracted file
04:52	<jtt>	Pumpitup, schedule shows only one beta  march 27 2008  5 alphas prior to that
04:52	<KeithWeisshar>	is the torrent from http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/gutsy/release/dvd/ubuntu-7.10-dvd-i386.iso.torrent a final version
04:52	<abcde_>	jdong, I don't see the "install plugins" option.  How do I install them?
04:52	<|neon|>	dotjay: wait one
04:52	<DerangedDingo>	KeithWeisshar: The URL says it all
04:52	<CoasterMaster>	KeithWeisshar, yes it is
04:52	<Wisteso>	cyph3x_: most people don't know what DDO is....    but dont expect it to run well
04:52	<RoC_MasterMind>	KeithWeisshar, yeah.
04:52	<dotjay>	|neon|:sure
04:52	<quaal>	HEY
04:52	<quaal>	servers slow
04:52	<quaal>	fix plz
04:52	<parsek>	iobelisk, I used cfdisk instead of partition editor
04:52	<Flyzoola>	what is the best software on ubuntu to broadcast a live radio? I've been at this for 6 hours haha. Anybody know? or any good tutorials? I just want to stream live MP3s
04:52	<jblp>	Man..
04:52	<jblp>	Everything is slow today
04:53	<Pumpitup>	jtt>ahh well guess ill have to wait :)
04:53	<episodic>	lol, i guess i will just continue to use mwsnap in wine :P
04:53	<Back2Basics>	KeithWeisshar, anything linux related will never be a "final" version.
04:53	<ademan>	Flyzoola: like on the internet? wouldn't icecast work well?
04:53	<arang2>	guys is it true that 2.6.22(gutsy) has an speed boost on SATA compared to 2.6.20 in feisty?
04:53	<iobelisk>	for all of you guys having problems with downloading stuff from the server, please go and try an alternative server. test the best one via the wizard. it might work.
04:53	<remer>	quit thank you so much
04:53	<dystopianray>	arang2: no
04:53	<jdong>	abcde_: hmm the option should be in there
04:53	<Wisteso>	cyph3x: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=4709
04:53	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: icecast is probably your best bet, you're going to have to figure out the configuration for *Any* of them
04:53	<Vlet>	Or use a torrent! :)
04:53	<jtt>	Pumpitup, are you going to gutsy?
04:53	<Kanti>	whats the link to the wizard?
04:53	<iobelisk>	parsek, i did not use cfdisk. so i am not sure about that.
04:53	<DerangedDingo>	Journeyman: Go with AWN. Kiba-Dock is overrated. Cairo-Dock has dead development.
04:53	<cyph3x_>	Westeso: whats up?
04:53	<pazsion>	ok, still trying to install to HD on a slow ass system, wondering if i can use command prompt
04:53	<Flyzoola>	ademan, I've tried it, but nothing works. Any good tutorials for how to get it working?
04:53	<Pumpitup>	<jtt>	been on it for a while now
04:53	<mrunagi_>	if i dist upgrade will i lose programs and settings?
04:53	<iobelisk>	why don't you try the partition editor if cfdisk did not work for you?
04:53	<dotjay>	|neon|: ah sorry |neon| i have that file and that was the file from which i installed vmware
04:53	<openbysource>	guys i have installed the boot loader (grub) manually. i have written the appropriate entries for gutsy in the boot file. it's working now. what should i write in the kernel line so it shows graphical boot and not text messages ?
04:53	<dystopianray>	mrunagi_: no
04:54	<krank>	What's the main difference between the DVD and CD iso?
04:54	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: did you check ubuntuforums?
04:54	<XsteelWolf>	WHat's the inititate button
04:54	<mrunagi_>	what happens with my compiz-fusion stuff
04:54	<dystopianray>	krank: dvd has livecd + alternate + languages + packages
04:54	<DerangedDingo>	openbysource: the option "splash"
04:54	<mrunagi_>	will it conflict with gutsy's desktop effects?
04:54	<parsek>	iobelisk, it will do the samething but I can try
04:54	<ademan>	Flyzoola: unfortunately i don't know much about it other than it's supposed to be the best...
04:54	<parsek>	right now kubuntu installation finished
04:54	<jdong>	krank: DVD has more packages
04:54	<openbysource>	just write splash at the end of the kernel line DerangedDingo ?
04:54	<jtt>	Pumpitup, ahh great me too but only on desktops have to keep my laptop stable for work related activities
04:54	<abcde_>	jdong, where is it?  under what option?
04:54	<Flyzoola>	I'll look into it more. Thanks guys

04:54	<jdong>	krank: more suitable for those without an internet connection
04:54	<ademan>	Flyzoola: i figure there are probably tutorials you can get to from google, or maybe a #icecast channel here

04:54	<ademan>	ergh

04:55	<dotjay>	where can i get those files
04:55	<dryrot>	KaiserRo: I thought Beryl doesn't exist anymore
04:55	<iobelisk>	yes, people downloading the iso's should use torrents. people having trouble updating repositories, can try a different server.
04:55	<DerangedDingo>	openbysource: I believe so. I removed my usplash option because usplash never worked on my system... if it was still there I'd check
04:55	<openbysource>	ok

04:58	<rredd4>	CosterMaster  DSheperd   one says yes, the other says no...  thats confusing
04:59	<jdong>	ixian_: it differs by a few updated packages of bugfixes
04:59	<XsteelWolf>	but what about initate
04:59	<magicrobotmonkey>	XsteelWolf: try the flying window button
04:59	<openbysource>	DerangedDingo: okay thanks alot.
04:59	<Psyber>	has anyone had any issues with repositories when upgrading to gutsy?
04:59	<rredd4>	zrk  english

04:59	<zrk>	ok
04:59	<magicrobotmonkey>	Psyber: they are probably pretty loaded atm
04:59	<kurisutofuaa>	anyone know of any good recipe app's?

04:59	<ubotu>	rredd4: If you installed a Tribe/Beta/RC version of Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) and have been keeping it up to date, then you are already running the latest version of Gutsy. To make sure, type « sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade » in a console.
04:59	<openbysource>	one more thing, can i configure the compiz-fusion that came default with the gutsy installation ?
04:59	<jtt>	Psyber, from the looks of things everyone is having some sort of issue

05:16	<_6StringKng_>	gnome-look.org
05:16	<localgod11>	just doesnt seam as peppy
05:16	<Dev-Dev>	ty ill ask there
05:16	<antitab>	jimmygoon: the CD is fine, I just booted it on my MacBook
05:16	<haru>	logreeval, sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
05:16	<notv>	does opengl work with the ati XPRESS 200M in gutsy?
05:16	<jimmygoon>	lexu1 do you not know where to look or is it not installed?
05:16	<oldmanstan>	lexu1: run update manager manually from menu, admin i believe
05:17	<Vlet>	lexu1: hit ctrl-f3 and type: kgsudo update-manager -d
05:17	<Psyber>	defrysk: I just checked and all but my ubuntu repos are commented out...  any other ideas why synaptic would be failing?
05:17	<lexu1>	jimmygoon: its not in the menu
05:17	<sanguisdex>	lexu1: system ->	Admin ->	update manager
05:17	<jimmygoon>	lexu1, you can always do it manually or open update-manager manually (Alt+F2, 'update-manager' or maybe 'gnome-update-manager')
05:17	<pazsion>	lol july 18th.. same problem no replies lol
05:17	<Dr_willis>	notv,  I THINK it does.. thats what i got on my laptop at least.. but its a rather low end card. so it cant do much 3d wise. :)
05:17	<jimmygoon>	antitab, oh
05:17	<siriusnova>	Ok so I got my external hd formatted to ext3 mounted, now is there any way i can write to it as a user?
05:17	<XsteelWolf>	magicrobotmonkey, it shows up on the top,how do move it to the bottom
05:17	<siriusnova>	because when it gets mounted i cant write to it
05:17	<logreeval>	haru: when i do that, it just says it wants to remove lm-sensors
05:17	<siriusnova>	as a regular user
05:17	<Psyber>	defrysk:  sorry non-ubunut repos are #
05:17	<Dr_willis>	siriusnova,  make a directory On the hd..  chown that dir to be owned by the user you want to have access to the drive.
05:17	<defrysk>	Psyber, a conflict might be the problem due to previously used non-ubuntu repos
05:17	<Vlet>	siriusnova: I think you need to change the owner of it's mount point
05:18	<lexu1>	jimmygoon: is there a way to see if its installed?
05:18	<Evanlec>	siriusnova, should be able to write to it...did u try it?
05:18	<defrysk>	Psyber, in that case a fresh install is advisable
05:18	<Fade2Black>	how do i disable my wireless card so i dont get this error message bcm43xx: error: microcode "bcm43xx_microcode4.fw" not available or fail to load how do i get the restricted fireware so i can get past this error
05:18	<magicrobotmonkey>	XsteelWolf: ahh, first create a new panel
05:18	<jimmygoon>	heh, I think the main server is getting pounded even more
05:18	<Nrbelex>	Will non-free packages be automatically updated through the default updater?
05:18	<Vlet>	siriusnova: like: sudo chown yourusername /media/something
05:18	<haru>	logreeval, i have no ideas then :)
05:18	<jimmygoon>	lexu1, its called "update-manager"
05:18	<oldmanstan>	Nrbelex: as long as they were installed through the package manager then yes
05:18	<XsteelWolf>	Add a new panel or create?
05:18	<jimmygoon>	try running that in a terminal
05:18	<siriusnova>	ok cool
05:18	<Vlet>	Nrbelex: yeah
05:18	<logreeval>	haru: ok, thanks anyways ;)
05:18	<Nrbelex>	Great, thanks
05:18	<Dr_willis>	Vlet,  Im not sure that works for mount points. :) i find it easier to just make a dir. and chown that.
05:18	<Psyber>	defrysk: well poop  and I just got my desktop setup the way I like it

05:19	<Psyber>	defrysk: is there a way to do a fresh install and keep my preferences ... like my /home directory?
05:19	<oldmanstan>	lexu1: sorry, 'sudo update-manager'
05:19	<defrysk>	Psyber, you could also try using aptitude to resolve the issue
05:19	<Vlet>	Dr_willis: well, you'd have to umount the drive first, then the mount point is just a dir
05:19	<jimmygoon>	Vlet, ctrl+f3 doesn't do anything?
05:19	<lexu1>	Vlet: I looked in Synaptic and it was not installed....so I am installing update-manager
05:19	<Psyber>	defrysk: what is aptitude?
05:19	<Evanlec>	thundr3, try super grub disk, just google it
05:19	<Vlet>	jimmygoon: oh... thought that was the shortcut for the 'run command'
05:19	<ademan>	is there a command to move volumes in lvm?
05:19	<Dr_willis>	Vlet,  and mounting somthing OVER a directory. makes the permissions on that dir. Ignored. I do belive. :)
05:19	<tritium>	Psyber: did you put /home on a separate partition?
05:19	<thundr3>	Evanlec: thanks, I'll try that
05:19	<jimmygoon>	:O did you remove update-manger :O
05:19	<XsteelWolf>	magicrobotmonkey, i did that,what about zooming back to desktop button
05:19	<dredhammer>	well one thing i can say about Gutsy is that bulletproof X works
05:20	<Psyber>	tritium: no :-( I wanted to but did not have the space to spare
05:20	<Vlet>	lexu1: open a terminal and try running: sudo update-manager -d
05:20	<Dr_willis>	dredhammer,  i managed to break it. :)
05:20	<koolarry>	hello is there any place I can download Ubuntu  doc ?
05:20	<dredhammer>	one upgrade and reboot later
05:20	<lexu1>	Vlet: I am installing update-manager
05:20	<jimmygoon>	Vlet, nah its Alt+f2 ... Alt+f3 is deskbar in gutsy ... btw, he apparently removed update-manger :S
05:20	<Vlet>	Dr_willis: oh, I can be a tard with stuff like that
05:20	<thedonvaughn>	Vlet: please don't refer people to #debian for ubuntu.  They won't get helped.
05:20	<Vlet>	lexu1: what? why?
05:20	<Fade2Black>	what would hte module name be
05:20	<Dr_willis>	Vlet,  its just how mounting things work. :)
05:20	<dredhammer>	apparently my video card just couldn't be recognized
05:20	<lexu1>	Vlet: it was not installed
05:20	<jimmygoon>	heh
05:20	<defrysk>	Psyber, if you have a seperate /home , a fresh install with a preserved /home should be a no brainer to maintain previous settings
05:20	<tritium>	precisely
05:20	<Vlet>	thedonvaughn: sorry, I thought it might be a good place for more advanced stuff
05:21	<lexu1>	Vlet: also the Add/Remove is not in my menu anymore...
05:21	<XsteelWolf>	nvm i saw it thanks
05:21	<thedonvaughn>	Vlet: nah, it's just that #debian doesn't support ubuntu.  That should be supported here
05:21	<Vlet>	lexu1: open a terminal and try running: sudo update-manager -d
05:21	<jimmygoon>	lexu1, it sounds to me like trying to upgrading your (Butchered) copy might be a bad idea
05:21	<iobelisk>	whoa. i just noticed going to "my computer" via nautilus does not show my /home partition. also, my home folder is created in / not in /home
05:21	<Psyber>	defrysk: so could I just backup /home install then recopy my old /home?
05:21	<Evanlec>	anyone else find the deskbar thing rather useless? it only finds "documents music and videos" apparently, very windows-ish
05:21	<iobelisk>	is this normal?
05:21	<jumbers>	Is there a way for me to set Update Manager to use a mirror? Because whatever it's trying to use, it's not getting anything
05:21	<thedonvaughn>	Evanlec: agreed.
05:21	<Vlet>	thedonvaughn: yeah, completely understood. My mistake :)
05:21	<Evanlec>	yay!
05:21	<adante>	hi, can i edit the titlebar to add additional buttons?
05:22	<csc`>	anyone mind directing me to the gutsy livecd?
05:22	<thedonvaughn>	Vlet: no worries :)

05:22	<nkryptd1>	Do i use the terminal to set resolution because its not allowing me to set it to my native resolution.
05:22	<dredhammer>	the best bet to updrage
05:22	<jimmygoon>	Psyber, I don't know if mine thing was a fluke but I reinstalled (From scratch) tonight and when I copied my home/jimmygoon dir with nautilus... it didn't take all of the regular OR hidden folders with it... I had to do some of them manually :S
05:22	<lexu1>	jimmygoon: well hopefully all I need is the update-manager and then I can update and then upgrade
05:22	<dredhammer>	is to get the laternative cd or dvd va torrent and mount the image and upgrade with that
05:22	<Evanlec>	thedonvaughn, if the deskbar thing is useless, i feel like i should get rid of trackerd too since it seems also useless
05:22	<jimmygoon>	lexu1, hopefully :D
05:22	<Vlet>	lexu1: have you tried just running it from a terminal like I suggested?
05:22	<jimmygoon>	:O, I kinda like deskbar personally
05:22	<oldmanstan>	lexu1: here are instructions on upgrading: http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UbuntuTutorials/~3/171861024/
05:22	<thedonvaughn>	Evanlec: should be able to disable it in System->Preferences-Session
05:23	<defrysk>	Psyber, just during a fresh install set up /home as /home , do not format is , and use the same username during install, after install and reboot you should get into your original /home/username , with original settings , Always make a backup first of course!
05:23	<jimmygoon>	I use it for the yahoo/history/email stuff though
05:23	<lexu1>	Vlet: yes..... the terminal crashed
05:23	<rookie__>	I have two folders with .avi's and .mkv video files in them. They show the generic totem icon, Both folders were on my system when I installed the gstreamer codec's.  How do I get them to show me video previews like every other video on my computer?
05:23	<Vlet>	lexu1: o_O
05:23	<Psyber>	defrysk: ohhh i c.  spiffy
05:23	<jimmygoon>	upgrade sounds worse and worse
05:23	<defrysk>	Psyber, I do it all the time ;)
05:23	<Vlet>	lexu1: sounds like something on your system is unhappy if the terminal crashes
05:23	<lexu1>	jimmygoon: ok... I have Update Manager going and it looks all good
05:23	<Evanlec>	thedonvaughn, yea i know, just wondering if there was any usefulness to such an obtrusive process...indexes my whole filesystem for what?
05:23	<KeithWeisshar>	why is the dvd torrent slow
05:24	<nkryptd1>	Am i supposed to use the terminal for resolution change?
05:24	<KeithWeisshar>	i'm not getting more  than about 100kb/sec
05:24	<jimmygoon>	KeithWeisshar, you dl with torrent much?
05:24	<iobelisk>	how do i get nautilus to navigate through to show my other partitions?

05:24	<koolarry>	is there a place I can download the Ubuntu  documenation ?

05:24	<defrysk>	Psyber, yw and enjoy , be carefull with mixing repos, its usually unneeded
05:25	<nkryptd1>	!resolution doesnt do anything when i type it into the terminal
05:25	<koolarry>	is it downloadable ?
05:25	<jimmygoon>	Evanlec, google? google can't search my evolution email or my history :P that and I kinda like how its integrated into gnome's open/save dialog

05:25	<oldmanstan>	xTheGoat121x: put /home on its own partition next time you do an install then you won't have to upgrade

05:25	<Weng_Lap>	So, is there a graceful upgrade process from Feisty to Gutsy?
05:26	<jimmygoon>	Evanlec, oh, yeah, I forgot they do have that for linux now.. I would be interested to see a comparison between tracker vs gdesktop
05:26	<Evanlec>	jimmygoon, and not to mention that google is the first results that come up from deskbar...wtf is that? how much google does a person need?
05:26	<xTheGoat121x>	oldmanstan, yeah, that's my next change.  I'm planning on making a shared partition between my XP and Ubuntu partitions.
05:26	<Psyber>	defrysk: how did I mix them in the first place?  I have only added 1 or 2 repos?  I also did not have any problems until I upgraded last night to gutsy.
05:26	<Walter>	Can anyone parse my iptables string and tell me if I'm doing something wrong? I'm trying to forward from one IP to another IP: sudo iptables --verbose -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 110.112.104.111 -j DNAT --to 208.69.150.114

05:26	<cellofellow>	Things have been going screwy. Totally unrelated but both happening at the same time, I have my 1280x800 laptop screen, which worked perfectly till I tried to configure a second monitor, is now defaulting to 1280x720. And nm-applet is starting an additional instance of itself every time I log in. (I had 4 last time, now I have 5.)
05:27	<Kyoku>	anyone doing the 7.04 >	7.10 upgrade? mine keeps sticking on file 12/18
05:27	<iobelisk>	hi. something seems to be wrong over here. i cannot see my /home and /other partitions. only /. also, i do not get a prompt for password when i open up synaptic. for / nautilus says user unknown and i have only read access??
05:27	<cellofellow>	jimmygoon: yes
05:27	<defrysk>	psyber you could try aptitude dist-upgrade to resolve it, aptitude has more powers
05:27	<Weng_Lap>	Or do I need to start scheduling downtime to bring up systems by hand?

05:28	<Vlet>	xTheGoat121x: I would assume so - unfortunately, I'm on a freebsd system at the moment, so I can't check :)
05:28	<cellofellow>	a simple killall nm-applet gets rid of them, but I get more the next time I log in
05:28	<xTheGoat121x>	mboso, actually, on the site it says to ONLY go from Feisty to Gutsy.
05:28	<IanLiu>	Is it possible to change the "Desktop" folder?
05:28	<Psyber>	defrysk: what does aptitude do?  BTW, my upgrade last night gave me funky errors about repos and not being able to install some stuff properlly
05:28	<Evanlec>	anyone found a FreeNX package for Gutsy??
05:28	<jimmygoon>	clay3482, try going to "Customize" and then dragging the themes into their respective tabs...
05:28	<petafile_>	I've got a radeon x600 mobility gfx card.  Do I want to use the ati driver or the radeon driver? (screw fglrx)?
05:28	<juanbond>	Gutsy is soo nice
05:28	<cellofellow>	Psyber: aptitude is a more powerful addition to the apt suite. It has more powerful dependancy resolving.
05:28	<juanbond>	I have to admit, installing on my laptop has been really nice.
05:28	<defrysk>	Psyber, aptitude does apt-get with more resolve options
05:28	<cellofellow>	Psyber: and a nice 'gui'.
05:29	<eulogy_>	Psyber: I that is the case, go into administration then software sources and make sure everything on the front tab is checked.
05:29	<ademan>	the livecd hardly works for me... lol, i'm hoping the installer will be better
05:29	<xTheGoat121x>	Vlet, ok, thanks.  I honestly have no need for my files to be indexed or any of that stuff
05:29	<Evanlec>	defrysk, can u explain what u mean by resolve options?
05:29	<rawake>	anyone here use bongo? i just installed everything and started it up but i can't figure out how i'm supposed to log into the web interface and where i'm supposed to configure it... the docs on the site are pretty vague... can someone point me in the right direction of getting started with bongo?
05:29	<IanLiu>	Is it possible to change the "Desktop" folder name?!
05:29	<Vlet>	IanLiu: perhaps you could remove your ~/Desktop and replace it with a symlink called Desktop that points to the location of your choice... not sure if that'll work, but worth a try :)
05:29	<eulogy_>	Psyber: Then run update manager and click check to download any respos. you're missing.
05:29	<IanLiu>	Hmm
05:29	<Pumpitup>	How do i know if compiz is running  and configure it under kde?
05:29	<Vlet>	xTheGoat121x: yeah, I'm just turning that off
05:29	<ademan>	Vlet: i'd think that'd work, but it's kinda a crappy solution
05:29	<iobelisk>	has anybody had the problem of not being able to access certain partitions? and not having write access to root?
05:29	<defrysk>	aptitude can resolve dependencies up to the point to uninstall a complete os to get the package installed
05:29	<cellofellow>	I guess I'll reboot instead of just relogin, and see what happens.
05:29	<ademan>	why not make a symlink somewhere else to ~/Desktop
05:29	<codeshah>	hey guys, is aptitude install very slow for everyone ??
05:29	<codeshah>	right now that is?
05:30	<iobelisk>	codeshah, change your software source serve
05:30	<clay3482>	jimmy "what correct tab"
05:30	<ademan>	codeshah: the servers are under a lot of stress
05:30	<Psyber>	eulogy_: I just ran update manager  it seems to be working... but somethings just are not install properlly
05:30	<mboso>	xTheGoat121x: ok, thanks. will upgrade to fiesty first
05:30	<iobelisk>	server
05:30	<Gunner_Sr>	where can I get more information and talk about i8k?
05:30	<cellofellow>	aptitude installs just quickly, my inet is slow though, so download is slow. Apt of any stripe HOGS bandwidth though.
05:30	<IanLiu>	It is because my Desktop is translated to Portuguese, which becomes "Área de Trabalho" and it is too hard to type..
05:30	<Vlet>	ademan, IanLiu: yeah it is... then perhaps the path to the users desktop dir is located in the gnome configuration manager
05:30	<codeshah>	ademan, but what should I change them to?... I am using the us.archive... hmm
05:30	<troxor>	IanLiu: there's probably a gconf setting- one sec
05:30	<Evanlec>	defrysk, so aptitude is better in that sense as its more thorough?
05:31	<tuntun>	Is there a way to burn all of the updates as they are downloaded onto a cdrw so I can use them again after reinstalling; and can then it remove any intermediate updates that are superseded?
05:31	<Psyber>	eulogy_  odd software sources were disabled in the sources list
05:31	<Starcraftmazter>	heyai
05:31	<iobelisk>	has anybody had the problem of not being able to access certain partitions? and not having write access to root?
05:31	<musikgoat>	i had a cp crash about half through on a 30gb media files transfer from one disk to another in one machine.   do you think rync would be best to find the files that are not copied to finish the transfer?
05:31	<ademan>	Vlet: well changing it there would shaft all non-gnome desktop environments, you may not care about this, but most DEs expect your desktop to be at ~/Desktop
05:31	<Starcraftmazter>	how do you upgrade from 7.10 beta to 7.10 ?
05:31	<defrysk>	Evanlec, if used with care it can be better
05:31	<iobelisk>	starcraftmazter: you just update through update manager.

05:32	<musikgoat>	ademan, do you know the rsync command for a differencial copy?
05:32	<IanLiu>	Actually, my Ubuntu is in Portuguese, which translates Dektop to another thing. I wanted to turn it back to Desktop
05:32	<kilopopo>	can you guys help me
05:32	<troxor>	IanLiu: never mind, nothing specifically, but there is an option I like
05:32	<KaiserRo>	Is there any chance I killed my gfx card bios while trying to set up beryl?  I cant get any signal to come from it
05:32	<kilopopo>	!glcore
05:32	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about glcore - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi

05:32	<jimmygoon>	Starcraftmazter, just install any updates that ubuntu has for you
05:32	<Starcraftmazter>	iobelisk: there seem to be no new updates for gutsy
05:32	<troxor>	IanLiu: open gconf-editor and go to /apps/nautilus/preferences/desktop_is_home_dir :)

05:33	<eulogy_>	Psyber: Under the third party software tab there should be two canonical sources, check those if they're not already.
05:33	<defrysk>	Evanlec, its a smarter tool with more power
05:33	<IanLiu>	Thanks
05:33	<kilopopo>	how do i generate xorg.conf
05:33	<iobelisk>	then you are all good starcraftmazter.
05:33	<jimmygoon>	Starcraftmazter, you don't have to do anything else (special)
05:33	<ademan>	musikgoat: pretty sure it defaults to differential, if i'm not mistaken you have to use a switch to turn it off
05:33	<troxor>	IanLiu: np, enjoy
05:33	<Evanlec>	defrysk, i see
05:33	<kilopopo>	how do i generate xorg.conf
05:33	<eulogy_>	Psyber: Under Updates, the only thing that should be checked under Ubuntu Updates is important security updates and recommended.
05:33	<kilopopo>	how do i generate xorg.conf??????????
05:33	<Starcraftmazter>	I thought there would be a final wave of updates once Gutsy was released, guess not then
05:33	<iobelisk>	starcraftmazter: try running sudo aptitude upgrade && sudo aptitude update. if nothing installs, youa re all good.
05:33	<Psyber>	eulogy_: when I upgraded last night I got an error involving util-linux:   now when I use synaptice this is where the dependency issues arise
05:33	<Starcraftmazter>	ok thanks
05:33	<iobelisk>	okay now, can somebody please help me
05:33	<eulogy_>	Psyber: Apply those, it should ask you if you want to reload and do so.
05:34	<defrysk>	kilopopo, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
05:34	<musikgoat>	thanks ademan
05:34	<iskaldur_>	hi, im running one of the alpha versions of gutsy gibbon right now (with kubuntu)...how do i upgrade to the release?
05:34	<iobelisk>	i just reinstalled ubuntu, but now nautilus does not recognize my home and other partition
05:34	<defrysk>	kilopopo, running defauls should do
05:34	<kilopopo>	defrysk, can you send me your xorg.conf
05:34	<ademan>	musikgoat:  -W, --whole-file            copy files whole (without rsync algorithm) btw
05:34	<defrysk>	defaults
05:34	<ademan>	musikgoat: from the man page
05:34	<iobelisk>	also, i dont seemt o have write access to the root partition
05:34	<iobelisk>	?
05:34	<defrysk>	kilopopo, nope, it would be useless for you
05:34	<christian383>	hi, can someone tell me the checksum of the gutsy DVD iso pls?
05:34	<MasterShrek>	iobelisk, what filesystem is it?
05:34	<defrysk>	!sudo iobelisk
05:34	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about sudo iobelisk - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
05:35	<kilopopo>	defrysk, can you check if it has glcore dri and other stuff enabled?
05:35	<defrysk>	!sudo | iobelisk
05:35	<ubotu>	iobelisk: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
05:35	<cellofellow>	how can I get my video settings back to the defaults (well, the sort-of defaults. I still want to use the restricted driver. :)
05:35	<troxor>	iskaldur_: you're probably already up to date, just apt-get dist-upgrade to double check
05:35	<jimmygoon>	cellofellow, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver
05:35	<MasterShrek>	cellofellow, what are "defaults" in your mind?
05:35	<petafile_>	I have a 1280x800 monitor using the radeon driver.  The "LCD Panel 1280x800" monitor doesn't have a 1280x800 resolution option in Xorg.conf.  what modeline should I add to get that resolution?
05:35	<defrysk>	kilopopo, use pastebin for your xorg.conf and ask again
05:35	<indraveni>	hi all
05:35	<tuntun>	 christian383: you can find it on the ubuntu download page
05:35	<jimmygoon>	!hi
05:35	<ubotu>	Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
05:35	<MasterShrek>	petafile_, ideally, but it doesnt always work
05:36	<KaiserRo>	Is there any chance I killed my gfx card bios while trying to set up beryl?  I cant get any signal to come from it
05:36	<indraveni>	i have an issue with my notebook and projector
05:36	<defrysk>	kilopopo, including what your prob is
05:36	<petafile_>	MasterShrek: ?
05:36	<Psyber>	eulogy_:  any idea why util-linux would be having issues?
05:36	<indraveni>	projector is working well and good with my notebook
05:36	<indraveni>	but
05:36	<theacolyte>	Well done team, well done... this is amazing, best release yet!
05:36	<cellofellow>	MasterShrek: whatever it was before I screwed with the Screens and Graphics utility. My 1280x800 who-knows-what-brand laptop monitor working at native resolution.
05:36	<inigomontoya>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09IbgYS7V-U
05:36	<christian383>	i could only find one for the CD
05:36	<jimmygoon>	KaiserRo, its software, not firmware, it doesn't flash. so no
05:37	<indraveni>	when i am playing some movie in notebook when connected to projector, there is no movie played int he output of projector
05:37	<Charlotte>	help
05:37	<MasterShrek>	cellofellow, follow jimmygoon's suggestion and do: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
05:37	<TECH_1>	Theacolyte: it is pretty cool
05:37	<cellofellow>	ok...
05:37	<ubajas>	Ubuntu 7.04. Connecting with SSH works fine internally on the subnet behind the router, but connecting from the outside causes "Connection refused" to appear. The port is forwarded properly, and the message is immediate. Connecting to a port that is not forwarded times out after a while, which means the forwarding should not be the problem. What could cause this?
05:37	<indraveni>	where as all other desktop content are well seen and movie is played well enough in the notebook
05:37	<iobelisk>	yes i understand about sudo guys. i opened up nautilus to check if my home files were in its own partition. but all it shows is the / partition, nothing else. i created 3 paritions on install. / ext3. /home et3 and /other reiserfs
05:37	<kilopopo>	defrysk, Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
05:37	<TheDukeNY>	Typically how long does it usually take shipit to deliver a cd in the United States?
05:37	<defrysk>	!ask | Charlotte
05:37	<ubotu>	Charlotte: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
05:37	<jimmygoon>	woops, I switched xserver/xorg around :P thanks MasterShrek
05:37	<KaiserRo>	jimmygoon:  thanks...I didnt think it could mess it up.  I guess it's just a bad coincidence
05:37	<cellofellow>	TheDukeNY: like 2 months.
05:37	<indraveni>	only the projector output is black in totem player
05:37	<MasterShrek>	i didnt even realize jimmygoon =P
05:37	<jimmygoon>	TheDukeNY, 2-3 weeks, but I'm in KS so I don't know if that matters
05:37	<indraveni>	why is this happening ?
05:38	<indraveni>	is there any extra configurations need to be done ?
05:38	<Charlotte>	i lost my sound after plaing with ndiswrapper
05:38	<defrysk>	kilopopo, thats not a question
05:38	<kilopopo>	defrysk, i get an error when i do glxinfo
05:38	<jimmygoon>	indraveni, I was having problems with some of my codecs outputting b/w only as well... I just kept reinstalling them and then it was okay for a while...
05:38	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, use a different player, mplayer or xine, and look maybe changing the way the dual-head setup is, xinerama or something else maybe
05:38	<kilopopo>	defrysk,  this is what it shjows Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
05:38	<ubajas>	indraveni: Usually the cause of missing video output on a projector is overlay issues.
05:38	<iobelisk>	anikush@anikush-family:~$ !sudo
05:38	<iobelisk>	sudo | anikush
05:38	<iobelisk>	usage: sudo -K | -L | -V | -h | -k | -l | -v
05:39	<iobelisk>	is that right?
05:39	<Charlotte>	everything was perfect till i decidet to uninstall ndiswrapper 1.47 and update to v1.48
05:39	<defrysk>	kilopopo, nvidia driver ?
05:39	<indraveni>	ubajas, overlay issues ?
05:39	<MasterShrek>	Charlotte, if it was working why did you update?
05:39	<Charlotte>	i unistalled the oldone then installeverthing again and now no sound
05:39	<kilopopo>	defrysk, nvidia driver is already installed
05:39	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, i will try that
05:39	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, so u finally built your own custom kernel that works? I finally concluded that it wasnt worth the effort, only thing i wanted really was the realtime version i think
05:39	<defrysk>	kilopopo, nvidia-glx ?
05:39	<jimmygoon>	iobelisk, it stands for "SuperUser DO" .... so like "touch /file" fails... but root can do it ... so "sudo touch /file" works... etc.
05:39	<defrysk>	is installed ?
05:40	<iobelisk>	is it possible that ubuntu did not mount the other partitins and wrote my /home folder within the / partition?
05:40	<jimmygoon>	totem-gstreamer seems to get better all the time, but it still sucks ... compared to vlc
05:40	<Pie-rate>	gaah livecds are so sloooooooooooooooooooow
05:40	<kilopopo>	defrysk, nvidia-glx-legacy
05:40	<Psyber>	night all
05:40	<drew_>	any clues on why my old thinkpad's extra keys don't work anymore (feisty ->	gutsy)? hotkey-setup package?
05:40	<TECH_1>	Kilopopo: Plunins?
05:40	<jimmygoon>	totem skrunches all my vids up
05:40	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, is your guess is like, totem is having some problem  ?
05:40	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, i think it was worth it, optimized for my processor instead of generic x86_64 its amd64 now
05:40	<kilopopo>	TECH_1,  plunins?
05:40	<IcemanV9>	Pie-rate: what do you expect? ;)
05:40	<TECH_1>	plugins
05:40	<jimmygoon>	indraveni, try vlc, imo
05:40	<Pie-rate>	woah love the new default wallpaper
05:40	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, possibly, i always had better luck with xine
05:40	<ubajas>	So, "connection refused" when connecting from "the internet", but not on the local subnet. What could cause this?
05:40	<defrysk>	kilopopo, and restarted x after install ?
05:40	<kdubois>	Pie-rate: I absolutely agree. its amazing
05:40	<kilopopo>	TECH_1, i do not have any plugins installed
05:40	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, humm...but i thot ubuntu automatically installed the correct kernel for your architecture...
05:41	<jimmygoon>	Pie-rate, I like the second one thats installed and not chosen by default
05:41	<kilopopo>	defrysk,  yes i restarted x
05:41	<kilopopo>	de
05:41	<kilopopo>	defrysk, can i see your xorg.conf
05:41	<iobelisk>	whats the command to check disk space thru the terminal?
05:41	<indraveni>	jimmygoon, ok i will try them
05:41	<defrysk>	kilopopo, kk one sec
05:41	<Charlotte>	it says "no volume control GStreamer plugins and/or no devices found"
05:41	<iobelisk>	how do i see a list of disks mounted and corresponding disk information?
05:41	<IcemanV9>	iobelisk: df -h
05:41	<Pie-rate>	jimmygoon: its ok...
05:41	<iobelisk>	thanks
05:41	<Charlotte>	:(
05:41	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, as evidenced by uname -a "Linux ubuntu64 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Sun Oct 14 21:45:15 GMT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux"
05:42	<Charlotte>	how the hell this happand???
05:42	<iobelisk>	ok i see my other partitions over there. how do i access them thru the nautilus GUI tho?
05:42	<tritium>	Charlotte: language, please
05:42	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, Linux dp-lappy 2.6.23.1-dp #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 15 21:17:16 CDT 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux   it says x86_64, but its set in the config for my amd k8 family processor, more optimized than generic x86_64 i believe
05:43	<iobelisk>	via the GUI what i see is  Computer- FileSystem (corresponding to only 14g which was the size of my / partition) and then home within that folder
05:43	<MasterShrek>	CharlieSu, try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure alsa-base    also try it for alsa-utils
05:43	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, hm, interesting...whats the preempt mean?
05:43	<MasterShrek>	low latency
05:43	<MasterShrek>	i think...
05:43	<MasterShrek>	lol i dont even remember
05:43	<Evanlec>	lol
05:43	<defrysk>	kilopopo, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41154/
05:44	<altbinbpl>	anyone here using automatix?
05:44	<Evanlec>	look at us, we're real experts ;p
05:44	<Evanlec>	altbinbpl, no!
05:44	<MasterShrek>	one sec Evanlec ill look at it...
05:44	<gameforge>	Hello, Kubuntu user here... in Adept Manager, when I click Manager Repo.'s ->	Download From ->	Other... ->	Find Best Server, it just closes the "Software Sources" dialog and chooses the main US server (which is hammered right now).  It doesn't seem like it's doing anything.  What should I do?
05:44	<jimmygoon>	altbinbpl, ugh
05:44	<dystopianray>	altbinbpl: don't use automatix
05:44	<Pie-rate>	hey, ubuntu.com told me "latest linux kernel" for gutsy, but uname -r says 2.6.22. latest is 2.6.23.
05:44	<MasterShrek>	yes Evanlec its low-latency
05:44	<jimmygoon>	gameforge, sadly the mainserver is getting hammered more than the us mirror
05:44	<defrysk>	altbinbpl, automatix is NOY supported here so dont ask
05:44	<Charlotte>	any ideas
05:44	<dystopianray>	Pie-rate: gutsy has 2.6.22
05:44	<altbinbpl>	worked great in feisty but seems broke for gutsy
05:44	<musikgoat>	Pie-rate: it was the latest
05:44	<IcemanV9>	gameforge: use different server .. try 'ca' or 'mx'
05:45	<jimmygoon>	altbinbpl, what all do you use it for to install?
05:45	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, ah cool, i think im goign to just get the lowlatency kernel meta package thing
05:45	<musikgoat>	at rc even i beleive
05:45	<J-_>	Hey, is there a book I can study from to get Ubuntu certified?
05:45	<thebailey>	gutsy will only let me display in low resolutions, i have an nvidia GeForce 6800 and all the noobish things i know to do dont seem to help... any advice?
05:45	<dolphinheadedmar>	i did the upgrade by downloading the alternate install cd, using that as my only repo, "sudo aptitude upgrade". now I get an error "Could not find the Gnome installation, will try running Failsafe xterm session", every time, help?!?!  please?
05:45	<Pie-rate>	musikgoat: i hear 2.6.23 has a new scheduler and other such nice things
05:45	<altbinbpl>	used it for the vmware server and ntfs tools
05:45	<Evanlec>	J-_, u can become Linux+ certified from CompTIA thats all i know tho
05:45	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, you can also change the timer frequency of your processor, i bumped mine up to 1000hz which is apparently the best choice for systems requiring fast interactive responses to events
05:45	<troxor>	thebailey: you probably want the restricted driver
05:45	<defrysk>	altbinbpl, no automatix broke gutsy so do a fresh install and stay away from automatix or ask somewhere else
05:46	<musikgoat>	Pie-rate: there are some additions i've read,  I imagine you could update to it, but i don't know if you can get it from the main repo
05:46	<tuntun>	Is there a way to burn all of the updates as they are downloaded onto a cdrw so I can use them again after reinstalling?
05:46	<gameforge>	IcemanV9, jimmygoon: Well, I got mirrors.kernel.org to work, but it got so far and told me that the repo was out of date... I haven't had much luck choosing other random servers - any other ideas?
05:46	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, no kidding...u did that during setup-xconfig ? my question then is who wouldnt want fast interactive responses to events ??
05:46	<ezzieyguywuf>	where can i get a good walkthrough for compiling some source
05:46	<thebailey>	i have the restricted driver turned on and it wont let me go above 640x480

05:47	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: you shouldn't ever have to though
05:47	<dolphinheadedmar>	after install i get an error that there gnome cannot be located, and i get bumped to xterm....help, please
05:47	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, i dont know why for sure some of those things arent enabled by default, but i guess its because some processors cant handle it and you would want the config that the most machines would support
05:47	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: i'm trying to control amarok with JamSE and i have to use the bemused server and install a patch with it and apparantly the only way to do that is to compile from source

05:47	<CapaH>	haha this is soo bad... I tap the table near the mouse and it bobs like 3 inches

05:48	<xamer>	Hello, I just upgraded from 7.10 beta to stable, on a toshiba a70 notebook, boot time takes about 10 minutes , with beta it was 1 -2 mins
05:48	<mm13>	anybody know anything about ATI mobility 2400 hd drivers?
05:48	<troxor>	dolphinheadedmar: sounds like an incomplete install, if you have an xterm, type sudo `apt-get install ubuntu-desktop`
05:48	<mm13>	:-X
05:48	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: read the link from !source in that case.  You want to rebuild the package with the patch
05:48	<tuntun>	CapaH: check the bloody preferences?!?
05:48	<musikgoat>	foxjazz: that involves a rimshot i'm sure
05:48	<mm13>	I'm new to linux, just playing around with it and haven't found anything
05:48	<troxor>	CapaH: alt+f1 to get the menu, then navigate to preferences for mouse

05:48	<dolphinheadedmar>	troxor: trying
05:48	<MasterShrek>	xamer, do a boot without splash and see where its hanging (remove the word splash from the kernel line in /boot/grub/menu.list)
05:48	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, yea i spose that makes sense....can you really "feel" it tho? or could it just be psychological? i want to see proof of this lol

05:49	<christian383>	can nobody tell me, where i can find the checksum for the Ubuntu Gutsy DVD iso? Cant find it on ubuntu.com
05:49	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, it boots much faster than it did on the generic 2.6.22
05:49	<CapaH>	troxer: I was there, the ONLY option I saw related to this was acceleration which was set to 2.0 -- I lowered it as far as it could go (1.0) ---- but that did not help a whole lot, I need some additional setting (using KDE btw)

05:49	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, really? it boots faster huh...well i spose that might be because its not loading all those modules maybe?

05:50	<foxjazz>	psyferre it's your video card
05:50	<MasterShrek>	ill recompile when im bored in class some day or something lol
05:50	<christian383>	from releases.ubuntu.com was a torrent
05:50	<Strike[]>	WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
05:50	<jflash>	jrib, but this is the OLD repos
05:50	<Journeyman>	arg
05:50	<musikgoat>	christian383: and also the MD5 checksum
05:50	<jflash>	those are*
05:50	<Journeyman>	the apt system is a piece of junk
05:50	<CapaH>	Does anyone know how I can set mouse sensitivity to be MUCH lower in xorg.conf for example?
05:51	<CapaH>	My mouse is unusable
05:51	<troxor>	christian383: if the torrent completed, the checksum verified correctly- torrents have built-in checksumming
05:51	<jrib>	jflash: it is unsupported which means you don't get security updates
05:51	<musikgoat>	christian383: http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/7.10/MD5SUMS
05:51	<defrysk>	Journeyman, you should know , if you say so
05:51	<Journeyman>	why when I try to uninstall a dev package it also removes the package the dev package is for
05:51	<MasterShrek>	CapaH, cant you set it in your gnome configurations?
05:51	<christian383>	yes, but only for the cd
05:51	<gameforge>	Well, I have a list of repo mirrors in Adept... I already tried a Canadian one, there aren't any Mexican ones listed - the page IcemanV9 posted has one, and it shows Gutsy, but I have no way to add it. :(
05:51	<tuntun>	CapaH: SYSTEM>PREFERENCES
05:51	<chalcedony>	greetings Journeyman
05:51	<dga>	!compiz
05:51	<jrib>	jflash: you should upgrade or do a fresh install of 7.10
05:51	<troxor>	CapaH: if there's an option explicitly defining mouse acceleration in xorg.conf, comment it out
05:51	<MasterShrek>	Journeyman, because the dev packages depends on the original
05:51	<musikgoat>	christian383: i missed what sum you were looking for
05:51	<jflash>	jrib, it's a virtual account, i cant upgrade on my own
05:51	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, oh...but i dont see how processor optimization would really affect boot times...
05:51	<christian383>	the md5sum
05:51	<dga>	!compiz | dga
05:52	<musikgoat>	christian383: for what tho?
05:52	<jflash>	jrib, i'm not trying to get sec updates, i need to install python-twisted
05:52	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, who knows, but it is definitely faster
05:52	<tuntun>	musikgoat: the gutsy dvd
=== DarkHack is now known as D[a]rkH[a]ck
05:52	<christian383>	dont know what you mean...
05:52	<gameforge>	It's OK, I'll just wait until the load lightens up - in the meantime, if anyone is so willing, the Kubuntu Gutsy DVD has about 6 seeders and hundreds of leechers, so if anyone has the ability to help out, it would be greatly appreciated - I've only d/l'd 100 or so megs in over 3 hours on a 7 mbit connection, and I have a 4+ share ratio...
05:52	<chalcedony>	does anyone know about installing Skype on edgy ? E: Couldn't find package skype
05:52	<christian383>	exactly... the ubuntu gutsy dvd
05:52	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, just download it via http then
05:53	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: There's no http download for the Kubuntu Gutsy DVD, just BitTorrent
05:53	<anabelle>	do anyone know any signal strenght differences between bcmfwcutter and ndiswrapper?
05:53	<jflash>	guys, i'm trying to access the Breezy repos. I can't upgrade to dapper cz this is a VPS accocunt
05:53	<jrib>	jflash: well the only thing that is wrong is the fact it is breezy
05:53	<DanMulvey>	alright guys, i have a noobish question
05:53	<defrysk>	gameforge, why not get the cd ?
05:53	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, i was not aware, why do u want the dvd? cant u just use the cd and install other packages from the net?
05:53	<christian383>	i am already seeding the ubuntu dvd
05:53	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: although the link that uboto provied was helpful, i don't see how to apply the patch
05:53	<Journeyman>	i also keep getting /var/lib/scrollkeeper/lv/scrollkeeper_cl.xml:1: parser error : Document is empt
05:53	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: all is says is to use apt-get
05:54	<DanMulvey>	im installing gibbon on my xp laptop, and i want to dual boot, but im not getting an option to resize my partition...any thoughts?
05:54	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, yea....i dunno, it is enticing but it sounds like it could be headaches...not to mention taking a couple hours to compile..
05:54	<macd>	DanMulvey, choose the manual partition option.
05:54	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: 'man patch' is very readable, feel free to ask for details if it is not clear
05:54	<kingnothing>	After updating from 7.04 to 7.10, X is no longer working. I'm getting a fatal error: no screens found. any ideas?
05:54	<Journeyman>	YaY for having to reinstall
05:54	<gameforge>	defrysk, MasterShrek: Well, I'm trying to upgrade - I don't want to wipe out, I've been upgrading since Dapper... I could do the whole upgrade from the net, but the mirrors are all busy and my "Find Best Server" button doesn't work - with the DVD, I could upgrade (mostly) locally.
05:54	<DanMulvey>	macd: wont that overwrite the xp partition?
05:54	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: thanks
05:54	<Journeyman>	!torrent
05:54	<macd>	DanMulvey, no, it will let you resize and partition to install
05:54	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, it takes 45 minutes to an hour, but theres no real headaches if u follow the guide i used, youd have to recompile any extra drivers you had tho (nvidia, etc.)
05:54	<troxor>	DanMulvey: you can also use the gparted livecd if all else fails- it's a pretty neat little util
05:55	<dolphinheadedmar>	troxor,it worked !
05:55	<dolphinheadedmar>	thank you!
05:55	<DanMulvey>	thanks ill try that
05:55	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, you would have been upgraded by now if you wouldnt have decided to use the dvd
05:55	<troxor>	dolphinheadedmar: no problemo- enjoy :)
05:55	<sanguisdex>	one maore package to go!!!!!
05:55	<dystopianray>	is it possible to create a bootable usb drive from an ubuntu livecd?
05:55	<Toma->	dystopianray➔ yep
05:55	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: well I've got the DVD downloading on another machine, I'd like to use the built in upgrade... been trying for hours
05:56	<booh>	on my laptop,  cpu and hdd are always busy... trackerd and mount.ntfs use ressources... like 81%... what is the purpose of trackerd ?
05:56	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: I'm also worried that if my mirror goes down in the middle of the upgrade, it will leave my system borked
05:56	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, got a link to that guide by chance?
05:56	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, no it wont, if it doesnt finish downloading all the packages, it shouldnt try to install any of them
05:56	<MasterShrek>	yea Evanlec one sec...
05:56	<Evanlec>	booh, trackerd is for search function, u can disable in system preferences >	services
05:57	<sanguisdex>	gameforge: I have been dling using the built in upgrade since 11  estern time this moring
05:57	<nnonix>	I'm being told there is no boot/shutdown splash in the final release (clean install) of Gutsy. Can anyone confirm or deny this?
05:57	<sanguisdex>	gameforge: just get the image
05:57	<kyled185>	booh: it should stop using so much resources after it's indexed everything
05:57	<fnadeau>	i'm having problem with my sound card, no sound comming out.  Seem to be recongnise and loaded properly, but still no sound.  SB Audigy.  Any clue?
05:57	<tuntun>	christian383: I dont think they did a dvd release this time, according to this: http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/
05:57	<Journeyman>	where is the ubuntu torrent
05:57	<jrib>	!torrents | Journeyman
05:57	<ubot3>	Journeyman: Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/ (CDs) or http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/7.04/release/ (DVDs)
05:57	<Evanlec>	nnonix, deny ?
05:57	<troxor>	fnadeau: did you check all the easy stuff, like volume, connections, etc?
05:58	<wastedfluid>	anyone here  familiar w/ troubleshooting s2disk on gutsy?  I'm having no luck.
05:58	<RedRose>	Anyone else having trouble pulling stuff from apt-get?
05:58	<Dr_willis>	fnadeau,  odd. My Audigy2zs works good - does it SEEM to play? just no sound? ie: a music player has the little bars jumping up/down?

05:58	<wastedfluid>	RedRose: repo's are slow, today was release day
05:58	<pazsion>	dang how do i get to console in ubuntu? or just tell me how to instal videocard driver..nvidia..
05:58	<nnonix>	Evanlec: you did a clean install of the final release and you get both the boot and shutdown splash screens?
05:58	<Flannel>	RedRose: The serves are more than likely getting hammered.  Try a different mirror
05:58	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: good point, although it already broke my sources.list once :)
05:58	<Flannel>	!nvidia | pazsion
05:58	<RedRose>	Flannel, Howso?
05:58	<DShepherd>	my gdm resolution on my laptop (hp) is not right. any one know how i can fix it

05:58	<Derek_>	hello all
05:58	<booh>	ok.  Anyway, my laptop is very very slow... I am not sure it's ubuntu problem or hardware...  HP  AMD-64-Dual core
05:58	<Jordan_U_>	What does this command ( which is running without my having started it myself ) do? "/usr/sbin/synaptic --hide-main-window --non-interactive --parent-window-id 58720259 --update-at-startup"
05:59	<Evanlec>	nnonix, well...i actually used RC1 but it had a boot splash, i disabled it tho cuz i like to see whats going on ;p
05:59	<Jimdb>	must be a toshiba laptop
05:59	<christian383>	well, what did i download then?
05:59	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, you said youve been upgrading since dapper?
05:59	<haru>	someone help me fix my gutsy, when it loads instead of that progress bar thingy, my screen blinks till it comes to GDM
05:59	<benny_>	man.. trying to install new packages is painfully slow.
05:59	<sanguisdex>	done dling yay!!!!!
05:59	<Journeyman>	bah, I am going back to windows I think
=== Element is now known as teknicaL
05:59	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, thats cr8zy lol
05:59	<booh>	I thought Dual Core 64 bits faster...
05:59	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: yep, since Edgy on my laptop
05:59	<anabelle>	how can i set the power of my bradcom woreless card
05:59	<anabelle>	im using bcmxx43
05:59	<Derek_>	hey, quick question following for anyone:
05:59	<DShepherd>	sorry not my gdm.. the progress bar thingy.. when booting. what is that called again.. usplash i think
05:59	<haru>	help me, i wanna see my usplash :'(
05:59	<Dr_willis>	fnadeau,  if using the digital output - you may ned to use the Mixer to enable the digital output.
05:59	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: i sitll have a question about patching. http://hcmeyer.de/bemused.patch that is the location of the patch i want to install, do i just save that webpage and run patch file.name of whatever i call it when i save it?
05:59	<Derek_>	i'm trying to boot up the livecd to install, but now i'm getting a busybox prompt... never happened before
05:59	<MasterShrek>	booh, are you using 64 bit ubuntu?
05:59	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: I've been using Linux since RedHat 4.1, and I'm SOO tired of reconfiguring all the same software - I'll do anything to avoid reinstalling
06:00	<Derek_>	i'm running a dell, with an ati vid card...
06:00	<TECH_1>	MasterShrek: I loaded 7.10 on another machine..the firewall keeps shutting off..any hints?.
06:00	<haru>	DShepherd, u cant see ur usplash too?
06:00	<nnonix>	Evanlec: I upgraded also and have the splash screens, but I'm told they are not there if you clean install the final release.
06:00	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, haha, good idea i suppose
06:00	<troxor>	Jordan_U_: it looks like an automatic updater
06:00	<Jordan_U_>	Derek_, Try the alternate install CD
06:00	<musikgoat>	christian383: how about this?
06:00	<musikgoat>	christian383: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/MD5SUMS
06:00	<haru>	someone help me fix my gutsy, when it loads instead of that progress bar thingy [usplash] , my screen blinks till it comes to GDM
06:00	<wastedfluid>	I don't have a splash on load off the final release.
06:00	<Jordan_U_>	troxor, Is it safe to kill it?
06:00	<Dr_willis>	i always disable the splash stuff anyway. :)
06:00	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: yes, but you need to be in the right directory and use the appropriate -p for the patch
06:00	<Evanlec>	nnonix, i have not heard anything of the sort
06:00	<wastedfluid>	I don't think it was included in the final cd.
06:00	<MasterShrek>	TECH_1, not really, check the firewall's logs i suppose would be my guess
06:00	<Jordan_U_>	troxor, There is no dpkg lock
06:00	<Evanlec>	nnonix, nor would i be worried about it if it were true
06:00	<TECH_1>	Will do.Thanks
06:00	<MasterShrek>	wastedfluid, it was
06:00	<DShepherd>	haru, i am not sure if the usplash is what I am talking about
06:00	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: what extension do i save the patch as?
06:00	<tuntun>	christian383: Ahh... There you go. Ubot inadvertantl linked to it. Why the hell they didnt put the dvd and cd checksums on the same page is beyond me, and http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/7.04/release/
06:00	<nnonix>	wastedfluid: thanks!
06:00	<pazsion>	::just got ubuntu on dell b110:::lol:::
06:00	<theacolyte>	anyway to make it so emerald starts on it's own without doing an emerald --replace?
06:00	<wastedfluid>	I'd prefere no splash, any how.  It always seems faster.
06:01	<DShepherd>	haru, you know when ubuntu is booting.. and the progress bar thingy...
06:01	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: anything
06:01	<wastedfluid>	MasterShrek; well, I got screwed of a splash screen I didn't want. :-)
06:01	<MasterShrek>	theacolyte, put it in a startup script
06:01	<haru>	DShepherd, its usplash i think
06:01	<ezzieyguywuf>	theacoltye: system>preferences>sessions
06:01	<eclecticus>	the asian guy in the green shirt freaks me out everytime i go to the Ubuntu website.
06:01	<nnonix>	Evanlec: not worried, just trying to determine if my friends install is good (as it is different than mine).
06:01	<haru>	DShepherd, or thats what i call it
06:01	<gameforge>	sanguisdex: about getting the images... the CD image is useless, I may as well use the net, I'm trying to upgrade - the DVD image can only be downloaded from BitTorrent for Kubuntu (and I'm trying on another machine, 5 seeders, hundreds of leechers)
06:01	<MasterShrek>	wastedfluid, well at least u didnt want it lol
06:01	<Derek_>	any guarantees!?
06:01	<DShepherd>	haru, kool well the usplash is huge..
06:01	<Evanlec>	nnonix, i see
06:01	<theacolyte>	ezzieyguywuf: thanks )
06:01	<ezzieyguywuf>	theacoltye:add emerald --replace and it will do it automatically on startup
06:01	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: thanks
06:01	<haru>	jrib, someone help me fix my gutsy, when it loads instead of that progress bar thingy [usplash] , my screen blinks till it comes to GDM .. how to i change resolutio for usplash??
06:01	<Derek_>	btw, i heart everyone in here hammering out answers
06:01	<DShepherd>	haru, not the right resolution. In fiesty it was fine
06:01	<troxor>	Jordan_U_: hm, weird... those options aren't listed in man synaptic... try killing it, see what happens :)
06:01	<theacolyte>	excellent
06:02	<nrdb>	running gutsy now
06:02	<haru>	DShepherd, same
06:02	<christian383>	thank you, thats what i was looking for... and the checksum matches mine!!!
06:02	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, well it did just come out today, there will be more leechers by tomorrow i suppose
06:02	<nkryptd1>	every time i try to dl a torrent it says port is blacklisted how do i change that?
06:02	<booh>	MasterShrek, yes of course.  Gutsy64
06:02	<DShepherd>	haru, any leads?
06:02	<dolphinheadedmar>	troxor: i did that, it loaded gnome, i went to use update manager, and it told me i had to do a partial upgrade, then the distro upgrade box freezes?
06:02	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, on that page is the first step at all required, section 1.1
06:02	<DShepherd>	haru, on your laptop?
06:02	<MasterShrek>	booh, and its slow?
06:02	<Jordan_U_>	troxor, Yea, I hate these commands that don't have their switches in their man pages
06:02	<haru>	DShepherd, naw.. i have just been shouting for past few hours
06:02	<booh>	MasterShrek, yes.
06:02	<jrib>	haru: /etc/usplash.conf
06:02	<haru>	DShepherd, peecee/desktop
06:02	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, oh...maybe i shouldnt do this tonight...i'll never get anywhere with apt-get...
06:02	<booh>	Take about 15 seconds to open firefox
06:02	<DShepherd>	haru, ok
06:02	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: yeah, I know, I'm just anxious :) was hoping to get it done by the weekend
06:03	<MasterShrek>	no Evanlec i didnt
06:03	<Jordan_U_>	haru, Might be easier to install splashy instead :)
06:03	<troxor>	dolphinheadedmar: hrm, can you open a terminal and type `ps aux | grep dpkg` ?
06:03	<booh>	In fact, it takes time to open apps but, inside the apps, all is ok.
06:03	<haru>	DShepherd, edit /etc/usplash.conf.. jrib owns

06:03	<DShepherd>	haru, haha. i was just going to ask about a config file. thanks
06:03	<Borat>	Hey does anyone know how to make the fonts look better?

06:04	<PiousMinion>	I'm trying to set up dual monitors in 7.10 and no matter what I do... if I move the mouse to the second monitor it won't move back to the first one.  ideas??
06:04	<JdU1>	no
06:04	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, well that was my plan...but im afraid if i have to grab packages from apt .... might take all night just to do that with the servers being hammered
06:04	<fnadeau>	troxor & Dr_willis: Mixer looks ok, volume to max, was working fine under FC7 ours ago but FC7 was sucking to much juice out of this old box, just switched to Ubuntu 7.10 but now i got no sound(and i did like the fact that i had to edit x11.cong to get proper resolution since the Resolution applet didnt had mine.. anyway)
06:04	<MasterShrek>	PiousMinion, thats weird, and kinda funny, but i got nothin
06:04	<troxor>	Borat: system->preferences->appearance ->	fonts tab, then adjust the "Rendering" options

06:05	<MasterShrek>	booh, my amd64x2 runs awesome
06:05	<admin8tor>	Funny, because I get sound under Ubuntu, but not FC 7.

06:06	<jrib>	!kernel >	Cale (read the private message from ubotu)
06:06	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, ic, i did that with the rc as well, then kept up-to-date until it stopped giving updates a few days ago
06:06	<tritium>	Cale: why are you bothering with your own kernel?
06:06	<[UPG]Pritchard>	@jordon:  It's worked for me before after manually editing the file.  ubuntu detects the proper card type and everything.
06:06	<Jordan_U_>	kingnothing, X won't start at all?
06:06	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U: no
06:06	<MasterShrek>	booh, that could possibly be a problem, is it a newer laptop?
06:06	<Cale>	Because I need reiser 4 support.
06:06	<troxor>	fnadeau: there is a switch, iirc, on the audigy (you can find it in alsamixer, among others) for optical out, which effectively disables analog output
06:06	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, it was givin me updates yesterday, but nothing today, i assumed because of all the traffic
06:06	<Fat_Ferret>	Evening all, got a problem I installed 7.10 and it was working great I restarted and its telling me "initramfs - failed to set xfermode"

06:06	<drew_>	any clues on why my old thinkpad's extra keys don't work anymore (feisty ->	gutsy)? hotkey-setup package?
06:06	<booh>	MasterShrek, Yes, less than 2 months ago
06:06	<troxor>	alienseer23: nothing that says dpkg <defunct>	or anything like that?
06:06	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U: in the gdm log file, I get an error... fatal server error: no screens found
06:06	<Jordan_U_>	kingnothing, Good, that would mean something was really broken if that happened in Gutsy :)
06:06	<Cale>	Unless you happen to know of a convenient package for a reiser 4 module.
06:07	<foxjazz>	does the xfi run on ubuntu yet?
06:07	<oldmanstan>	so much for bulletproof x
06:07	<tritium>	Cale: no, I avoid reiser even more than I do the plague
06:07	<alienseer23>	troxor:no, only what i put in my last comment
06:07	<_Codeman_>	Is anyone else having problems downloading packages?
06:07	<oldmanstan>	_Codeman_: yes everyone is
06:07	<troxor>	alienseer23: ok, that's good- did you give it some time?
06:07	<dystopianray>	foxjazz: maybe, you have to install and configure the drivers yourself though
06:07	<Jordan_U_>	oldmanstan, No, it did work for kingnothing , unless it isn't working for you
06:07	<tritium>	_Codeman_: many are, as the servers are being hammered right now
06:07	<fnadeau>	troxor: problem solved... who is the dude that made that option enable by default???
06:07	<oldmanstan>	_Codeman_: it's because new version just got released, everyone is installing
06:07	<kyled185>	_Codeman_: I've been having trouble all day, servers must be on fire or something
06:07	<alienseer23>	should I go to term and do 'sudo aptitude upgrade'?
06:07	<MasterShrek>	booh, interesting, im not really sure what the problem might be, u say u have the same problems with vista or no? other than just the crappy vista stuff
06:07	<_Codeman_>	K, thought so
06:07	<foxjazz>	dystopianray are there drivers?
06:07	<defrysk>	Cale, reiser4progs perhaps ?
06:07	<DShepherd>	_Codeman_, yeah.. try another server
06:07	<Cale>	So, uh, yeah, is there a convenient way to build myself a restricted-drivers package for my custom kernel, or do I just have to install that stuff separately?
06:08	<_Codeman_>	Good thing I upgraded yesterday
06:08	<oldmanstan>	Jordan_U_: oh mine works peachy, i was just editorializing
06:08	<alienseer23>	troxor: yes
06:08	<Cale>	defrysk: That's just user tools.
06:08	<alienseer23>	still froze
06:08	<dystopianray>	foxjazz: yes, creative released x-fi drivers for linux
06:08	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U: I updated from the alternate CD downloaded through a torrent. the update servers are hosed
06:08	<troxor>	fnadeau: I don't think it was a default, but regardless, I'm not too sure how it gets enabled though :)
06:08	<MasterShrek>	Cale, i would just do it seperately
06:08	<SunmanXII>	quick question - is there a way to queue files to xmms in terminal
06:08	<defrysk>	Cale, libaal-dev perhaps ?
06:08	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, this article is a decent read: http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/10/16/64-bit_more_than_just_the_ram/1
06:08	<booh>	MasterShrek, Vista is slow too... but I though it was vista... and now, ubuntu is slow too but only when it needs access to hard drive.
06:08	<_Codeman_>	another server?

06:09	<Jordan_U_>	kingnothing, The alternate CD does not contain the ATI / Nvidia drivers AFIK
06:09	<MasterShrek>	yea i saw that earlier Evanlec, skimmed through it, bookmarked it, its more of a thing ill read in class lol
06:09	<dystopianray>	pazsion: you don't need to install intel graphics they should 'just work'
06:09	<prince>	dammit ubuntu kernel devs, fix the damn dmraid bug

06:09	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, can u post your uname -a output again
06:09	<haru>	DShepherd, works for me :D
06:09	<musikgoat>	there are a few bugs out there
06:09	<troxor>	Ryuho: changing feisty to gutsy in sources.list, then apt-get dist-upgrade
06:09	<tritium>	!upgrade >	Ryuho
06:09	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U_: guess i'll try installing a driver and see if that changes anything. i thought there was a specific error for that, though.
06:09	<pazsion>	how can i check on the intel graphics card? from what i caan see it's not being used..but i'm new

06:10	<wastedfluid>	That's what I figured.  Yes, I get an error.  Jordan_U_ I get:  (s2disk: Could not stat the resume device file. Reason: No such file or directory)
06:10	<alain>	but still cant get the right resolution for my monitor
06:10	<haru>	DShepherd, not imo unless u entered the alues wrong
06:10	<meta-paonia>	haru - add another clock
06:10	<dimych>	I have 6.06, and want to upgrade to 7.10. Is there a way to skip 6.10 and 7.04, or at least install them (from network) without downloading the full distros?
06:10	<Ryuho>	k thx tronyx
06:10	<alain>	all
06:10	<rryan>	Ryuho : you could also do : sudo update-manager -c

06:11	<MasterShrek>	u dont want the patch
06:11	<wastedfluid>	Thanks anyways, mate
06:11	<violet>	ada yang pake bahasa indonesia ga???
06:11	<clusty>	defrysk: great. tomorrow will play with this
06:11	<Pie-rate>	ok, the ubuntu installer *commented out* the security.ubuntu.com entries in sources.list, because it couldn't find security.ubuntu.com because i hadn't connected to my wifi ap. WHY? if it can't find them on install, it should assume that the user will get teh internets working later, not comment out the security repo.
06:11	<troxor>	alienseer23: did you try apt-get update/upgrade from command line, with the same results?
06:11	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, no? which one do i want then lol? http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/

06:12	<nkryptd1>	can someone help me with the terminal
06:12	<alienseer23>	troxor: will do this now
06:12	<haru>	DShepherd, i mean use the values 1280 x 800
06:12	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, isnt that what i just said?
06:12	<clusty>	defrysk: i am on gutsy now. whoudl i maybe wait a week extra? more stuff to be stabilized?
06:12	<DShepherd>	haru, there was no values for me. xres= and yres= . that's what was in it
06:12	<DShepherd>	haru, ok
06:12	<troxor>	alienseer23: there's also a dpkg lockfile or pid in /var/ something that shouldn't be there when running apt-type-stuff
06:12	<pazsion>	crap
06:12	<dimych>	IcemanV9, yes, I unrstand that I can not jump, but perhaps there is a way to install only kernel and main libs of 6.10 and 7.04?
06:12	<n2diy>	IcemanV9: yes, stable as a rock..
06:12	<MasterShrek>	IcemanV9, i like the attitude :)
06:12	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, oh, i linked to the Patch...gotcha
06:13	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, no, yours was the patch, that was the actual kernel

06:13	<Jordan_U_>	clusty, Things don't "get stabilized" after release, other than the repositories not being so slow
06:13	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, ic ic, is the realtime thing a patch i gotta add?
06:13	<IcemanV9>	dimych: i have tried it once on another box .. it acted funny. so i scraped that idea. *shrug*
06:13	<Flannel>	dimych: If you wait six months, you'll be able to jump straight to 8.04 from 6.06 though

06:14	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, no, just an option you set in the config, its actually low-latency, btw are you using an amd64 chip?
06:14	<Doctor_Nick>	Has anyone had issues with sound services refusing to start after upgrading to gutsy?
06:14	<musikgoat>	dystopianray: thanks
06:14	<clusty>	defrysk: upgrade as of make fresh install

06:14	<nkryptd1>	WHen i try to use torrent it says port is blacklisted
06:14	<defrysk>	kilopopo, desktop effect on a legacy nvidia card , unlikely to work smooth
06:14	<wastedfluid>	I can't wait for 8.04.  I honestl think i'm going to stick to the LTS's so I don't have to troubleshoot everything.
06:14	<dWho>	is there any other way to upgrade from a cd ?

06:15	<RedRose>	has anyone gotten TrueCrypt Working?
06:15	<nkryptd1>	When i try using a torrent it says port blacklisted how do i change port im using
06:15	<nickrud>	DShepherd: were you ever able to fix that issue
06:15	<tritium>	suupaabaka: if you put /home on its own partition
06:15	<Flannel>	IcemanV9: yes.  LTS to LTS is supported (or will be, anyway)
06:15	<Jordan_U_>	IcemanV9, Gutsy is not LTS
06:15	<defrysk>	suupaabaka, only if you have set up a seperate /home partition set up
06:15	<traxtar3>	which torrent app are you using?
06:15	<n2diy>	Flannel: Jordan_U, I can wait. :)
06:15	<dWho>	gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade " not workin how come?
06:15	<MasterShrek>	suupaabaka, before you start the install, mount your partition, and remove all the folders except /home then do the install and dont format it

06:15	<MasterShrek>	suupaabaka, make sure you unmount the partition before you start the install
06:15	<Jordan_U_>	dWho, Is it giving an error?
06:16	<IcemanV9>	Jordan_U_: i know. thanks. :)
06:16	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : no messages whatsoever
06:16	<dWho>	nothing
06:16	<MasterShrek>	suupaabaka, you may also need to remove the .gnome and .gnome2 folders in your users home directory
06:16	<traxtar3>	nkrypd1: i had the same problem, so i switched to kubuntu
06:16	<violet>	burikkkkkkkkkkkkkk
06:16	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: you don't have to do that.  You just tell the installer not to format the partition in gparted
06:16	<Evanlec>	defrysk, he can also just install to a new partition like i did, and just mount the old installation and transfer stuff over
06:16	<traxtar3>	*ktorrent
06:16	<suupaabaka>	Wow... sounds complicated.

06:17	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : any idea?
06:17	<DShepherd>	both on my desktop and on my laptop
06:17	<pazsion>	i see everything i'm doing
06:17	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: i do it all the time, what do u mean?  You setup the partitions you setup your /home to be mounted, just not formated.  That way all the data in the /home partition is in tact.
06:17	<haru>	how do i make the clock look like this http://www.novell.com/connectionmagazine/2007/q2/img/tt6_02.gif
06:17	<suupaabaka>	would i benefit much from a fresh install anyway?
06:17	<Jordan_U_>	dWho, But does it "finish", do you get back to a prompt?
06:17	<dystopianray>	pazsion: then your video cards are working
06:17	<Evanlec>	defrysk, what?
06:17	<pazsion>	lol
06:17	<Pie-rate>	oh, usplash being a buggy piece of crap as usual

06:17	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, Install splashy
06:17	<Evanlec>	lol
06:17	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, if his /home dir isnt on a seperate partition
06:17	<pazsion>	so i can also have multiple monitors?

06:18	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : use alt+f2 then typed it in the box.. nothing happen
06:18	<DShepherd>	nickrud, know anything about usplash setting its resolutions?
06:18	<nickrud>	DShepherd: bummer. At least only one belongs to me, but that's not saying much
06:18	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: unless i'm confused
06:18	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, forget it
06:18	<Jordan_U_>	dWho, Start it from a terminal

06:19	<nickrud>	DShepherd: disabling usplash? For me, it's an fglrx bug
06:19	<silent>	CapaH, mouse sensitivity is set in preferences
06:19	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, with splashy it couldn't be easier, in fact splashy >	usplash in every way I can think of :)
06:19	<haru>	how do i make the clock look like this http://www.novell.com/connectionmagazine/2007/q2/img/tt6_02.gif
06:19	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: on one computer the monitor says "out of range," on my laptop it just gives a black screen
06:19	<DShepherd>	nickrud, oh ok. understood.
06:19	<Jordan_U_>	prince, mount
06:19	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: oh i see.  didn't realize /home wasn't on a seperate partition.  But yah in that case i'd go one more step and create another partition and copy /home to it then format over everything.. :)
06:19	<troxor>	haru: I believe that's the international clock applet
06:19	<pazsion>	ook lets see if reboot will bring up other monitor on nvidia...
06:19	<haru>	tronyx, package name?
06:20	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : any idea ?
06:20	<silent>	mmm... I'm feckin BAKED and im chillin with a rum n coke... bring on the questions
06:20	<DShepherd>	nickrud, well i am trying to reset mine to its correct resolution.. but editing the /etc/usplash.conf file is not enough
06:20	<prince>	Jordan_U_: hmm
06:20	<DShepherd>	nickrud, am i missing a step?
06:20]  * nickrud makes a uncritical note to look at splashy
06:20	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, That sounds like a frame buffer problem rather than a usplash problem, but try splashy anyway
06:20	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, yea, well i didnt know if his /home dir was on a different partition anyways, and i forgot who was asking too lol
06:20	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: heh
06:20	<tronyx>	ahhhh why do random people keep saying my name, i think you mean troxor?
06:20	<CapaH>	silent: I went to the kde control panel to the mouse settings and I can only set acceleration to 1.0 (no lower) and I can only set threshold to 20 (no higher ) ---- even with these settings my mouse is WAY too sensitive --- also, I cannot change ANY of the compiz settings
06:20	<suupaabaka>	me ;D
06:20	<Logicwax>	hey....any of you upgrade to gutsy AND are an avid user of automatix?   last few times i upgraded to new ubuntu distros everything got screwed up and someone told me its because of automatix
06:20	<Pie-rate>	X works, usplash doesn't.
06:20	<nickrud>	DShepherd: possibly setting the vga= for the kernel line? That's just an uneducated guess, though
06:21	<troxor>	tronyx: sorry :)
06:21	<dWho>	can't upgrade from cd how come?
06:21	<silent>	CapaH, I'm not familiar with kde, but you use a panel to control compiz right?
06:21	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, X does not use the frame buffer :)
06:21	<tronyx>	lol no worries troxor, we're just 2 cool people
06:21	<Flannel>	Logicwax: Thats more than likely true, yes.  Automatix breaks things.
06:21	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, Do your tty's work?
06:21	<Logicwax>	hrmm...damn
06:21	<troxor>	haru: it doesn't look like it's in the default repos- one sec
06:21	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: yes.
06:21	<MasterShrek>	Logicwax, automatix is crap, people that install it are total noobs and shouldnt be using linux because they arent learning anything
06:21	<traxtar3>	gusty was suposed to make automatix obsolete
06:21	<haru>	tronyx, thanks a lot :D
06:21	<riotkittie>	!noob | MasterShrek
06:21	<Jordan_U_>	MasterShrek, You don't need to insult the people that use it
06:21]  * riotkittie hides
06:21	<n2diy>	! automatx | Logicwax
06:21	<tronyx>	haru .... troxor! HELP
06:21	<nickrud>	automatix was obsolete the day it came out
06:21	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, lol, thats pretty harsh ;p
06:21]  * MasterShrek is a noob
06:21	<nkryptd1>	when i type !resolution into terminal it says command not found
06:22	<Evanlec>	haha
06:22	<Logicwax>	any chance I can reverse the damage of automatix?   i like automatix because it does a lot of work for me when i setup a new system
06:22	<haru>	troxor, sozz.. thanks a lot
06:22	<tronyx>	lol
06:22	<traxtar3>	nickrud: good call
06:22	<riotkittie>	Logicwax: no. there is no reversal. there is only clean install.
06:22	<Jordan_U_>	nkryptd1, !resolution is a command for ubotu :)
06:22	<MasterShrek>	ubotu isnt around...
06:22	<Evanlec>	Logicwax, should be able to just remove the stuff it installs using it, then uninstall it...
06:22	<Jordan_U_>	!resolution | nkryptd1
06:22	<MasterShrek>	i miss ubotu
06:22	<Evanlec>	wheres ubotu? that never happens lol
06:22	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : i'm back to the prompt after issuing the command
06:22	<MasterShrek>	especially today, he must be getting overworked, needed a vacation or something
06:23	<silent>	I dont see why you wouldnt do a reinstall anyway... backup your /home and config files and reinstall
06:23	<MasterShrek>	or theyre probably just updating his factoids for the new release
06:23	<nkryptd1>	im trying to change my resolution its not workign i have no idea wtf im doing with the terminal
06:23	<Evanlec>	haha yea
06:23	<n2diy>	! Ubotu
06:23	<CapaH>	silent: The option for the compiz control panel is in the menu --- but it never loads
06:23	<lwizardl>	hi
06:23	<traxtar3>	nkrypd1: PM me
06:23	<DIguana>	Anyone know what the next LTS version of Ubuntu is going to be?
06:23	<musikgoat>	nkryptd1: thats how you learn
06:23	<tritium>	DIguana: 8.04
06:23	<dystopianray>	DIguana: 8.04
06:23	<nickrud>	DIguana: 8.[4567]
06:23	<musikgoat>	DIguana: hardy herron
06:23	<musikgoat>	heh
06:23	<troxor>	haru: your best bet is to wait until it becomes available: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/+source/intlclock   if you're impatient, you can check getdeb.net, to see if there's a package available sooner (but be aware these aren't official packages). if you're really impatient, you can scrounge up the source and compile it yourself  :)
06:24	<silent>	CapaH, I'd recommend a clean install... the amount of time the upgrade will take you could have everything up and running on clean
06:24	<riotkittie>	i'm going to stick to calling it 8.04 or risk total embarassment. D:
=== Erik__ is now known as enoex
06:24	<silent>	CapaH, really not kidding, just back up your /home and config files and clean
06:24	<meta-paonia>	IMHO - Ubuntu has gone waaaahhhhhh,,,,, information overload, to upgrade or not to upgrade, I would love to have the option to take modules from one kernel and port it into the new kernel, things get buggy- note for kernel team:ATI Radion 200 fails on some systems, esp. Celeron D - And it drops support for some processors - esp Geode 200/300mhz - what happened to a massive driver database??? I have lots of questions - I have been using
06:24	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, dont u think that guide u gave me is a little old? 6.10? or do u think its fine?
06:24	<n2diy>	hardy herron? Why not happy hippo?
06:24	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: damnit, the splash screen is the first thing a new user sees when they install ubuntu. it really pisses me off that they can't get it right. it's broken for me one way or another on at least 3 separate computers
06:24	<dWho>	silent : but all the application need to be reinstalled again
06:24	<musikgoat>	!ubotu
06:24	<nickrud>	lol, riotkittie
06:24	<haru>	troxor, ahh.. the source is broken then T_T
06:24	<TECH_1>	I agree silent
06:24	<silent>	dWho, reeeeaaally easy to get them back
06:24	<Flannel>	meta-paonia: You might file bugs about the regressions
06:24	<diabolix>	are the mirrors down? cause i can't install anything?
06:24	<silent>	its not like windows
06:24	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, its the one i followed, works just fine, makes deb packages for the kernel and headers, and when u install them it adds entries to grub
06:24	<dWho>	silent : still would take time
06:24	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, Does splashy work for you?
06:24	<lwizardl>	what cd ripper has the most file configurations available? on windows I used to use dbpoweramp
06:24	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: got a question for you in #ubuntu-classroom
06:25	<silent>	hell, you could make a script to get all the programs you need set up
06:25	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: haven't tried it
06:25	<TECH_1>	Each set up is its own
06:25	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: if splashy is better, why isn't it used?
06:25	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, cool cool, was just wonderin about step 1.1
06:25	<erlinux>	im seeding for xubuntui386 :d
06:25	<traxtar3>	nkryptd1: you still here?
06:25	<silent>	backup config files for the programs, usually stored in /home anyway.... and make an apt-get script to get all your custom programs
06:25	<CapaH>	silent: Well, I already DID the upgrade, so -- I would rather just get it working from here
06:25	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, I have no idea, been wondering that myself
06:25	<dWho>	can anyone tell me why gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade " not working ?
06:25	<ubotu>	I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
06:25	<ezzieyguywuf>	!paste
06:25	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, yea dont worry about that one, i didnt do it, everything else shold be fine, skip the patches thing unless you are patching your kernel, which i doubt u are
06:25	<Hilikus>	im trying to access a samba share from windows, i can see the machine but when im prompted to authenticate, it doesnt take the info, like if the password was wrong, but i set is using smbpasswd
06:25	<DIguana>	Has anyone else noticed that the Gnome Deskbar Applet seems to have had several features removed this time around? I can't get it to give me an area to type in the bar itself and it no longer seems to be able to look up Wikipedia entries, which was what I mostly used it for. Does anyone know how to restore this functionality?
06:26	<Hilikus>	what can i try to be able to connect?
06:26	<meta-paonia>	diabolix - servers are slow - people are upgrading - I just installed a few packages from feisty main and it was really slow but it did the job
06:26	<musikgoat>	ubotu is lagging?  !help
06:26	<zhanx>	change your servers
06:26	<Rodya>	just a random comment... my old handwritten xorg.conf with some slight modifications fixed all my problems with compiz in gutsy
06:26	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, yea im all set with patching
06:26	<MasterShrek>	Hilikus, try setting    security = share   in /etc/samba/smb.conf   and then restarting samba
06:26	<traxtar3>	Hilkis: did you do a $sudo smbpasswd -e user_name?
06:26	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)

06:26	<nickrud>	!doesntwork | dWho
06:26	<musikgoat>	hehe !ubuotu
06:27	<adlisyakir>	hye.. what is diff. between ubuntu and gobuntu
06:27	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, jimmygoon no luck with any other players also
06:27	<MasterShrek>	XsteelWolf, check out www.caedes.net they got lots of em, or gnome-look.org
06:27	<XsteelWolf>	adlisyakir, it's the u and go lol
06:27	<indraveni>	still i couldn't see video file running in the projector output
06:27	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, are u using nvidia?
06:27	<Hilikus>	MasterShrek i have security = user commented out
06:27	<TECH_1>	Apic of bill gates crying?..backround.
06:27	<dWho>	nickrud : any idea?
06:27	<Hilikus>	whats security = share?
06:27	<ubotu>	dWho: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
06:27	<MasterShrek>	Hilikus, change it to security=share and uncomment it
06:27	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, no, its i810
06:27	<nickrud>	dWho: without more information
06:27	<tuntun>	Is there a way to burn all of the updates as they are downloaded onto a cdrw so I can use them again after reinstalling?
06:27	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, then i dont know for sure, if it was nvidia it would be easy
06:28	<Augusta>	help! I can't upgrade to 7.10! The installer requires 2801M of free space on /. Anyone?
06:28	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, what if you close the screen on the laptop?
06:28	<nickrud>	well, ubotu's only a minute late
06:28	<riotkittie>	Augusta: free some space?
06:28	<sorsis>	how do i update from 7.04 to 7.10?
06:28	<silent>	Augusta, get a bigger hard drive you nub
06:28	<dWho>	can't upgrade from a cd using gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" nothing happens after issuing the command
06:28	<MasterShrek>	Augusta, you must have had alot of programs installed lol
06:28	<nickrud>	dWho: try gksudo
06:28	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, actually in my laptop, its not toggeling the laptop screen with the projector screen with Fn+F7
06:28	<tuntun>	mmm, nub...
06:28	<Hilikus>	2.8GB to update?? wow
06:28	<FluxD>	Can you upgrade my mounting the iso?
06:28	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, i have only one option to use on both the screens
06:28	<DIguana>	sorsis: Run the Update Manager. It's in your System>Administration menu.
06:28	<Jordan_U_>	nickrud, They do the same thing by default on Ubuntu
06:29	<traxtar3>	later all
06:29	<silent>	Hilikus, this is why I got the prerelease... I got all my updates before the mirrors started getting raped
06:29	<DIguana>	There'll be a button there that'll let you upgrade.
06:29	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, does anything show up on the projector?
06:29	<silent>	have a gutsy system operational
06:29	<meta-paonia>	indraveni - your laptop may have multiple moniter support
06:29	<dWho>	nickrud : back at prompt nothing happens should I get a dialog after issuing the command?
06:29	<MasterShrek>	silent, tru.dat
06:29	<tuntun>	Is there a way to burn all of the updates as they are downloaded onto a cdrw so I can use them again after reinstalling?
06:29	<nickrud>	Jordan_U: I know, but it's easy to switch and some people don't remember doing it
06:29	<MasterShrek>	yea im running gutsy with all my progs just fine :)
06:29	<Jordan_U_>	nickrud, To actually get the functionality of gksu you have run "gksu --su-mode"
06:29	<Hilikus>	silent you still needed 2.8gbs to store them
06:29	<n2diy>	adlisyakir: did you get your answer? Things are moving to fast for me to keep up.
06:30	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, I am able to view my desktop in projector
06:30	<nickrud>	Jordan_U: or run gksu-settings
06:30	<Augusta>	every time I free space it asks for more... I do have a lot of programs, but I think it shouldnt happen, since upgrade from edgy to feisty worked OK
06:30	<silent>	Hilikus, on a computer with 120 gb on it I'm not concerned
06:30	<Pie-rate>	repo is slooooooow.
06:30	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, start the movie and close the laptop monitor
06:30	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: another question :-D
06:30	<nickrud>	Jordan_U_: at least I think I remember that
06:30	<silent>	I also have a 1TB server I could mount in smb to extend any portion
06:30	<tuntun>	Is there a way to burn all of the updates as they are downloaded onto a cdrw so I can use them again after reinstalling???>:o
06:30	<Owner_>	hey i installed gutsy gibbon fresh and my keyboard doesnt work on the system
06:30	<tuntun>	:-D
06:30	<nickrud>	dWho: not sure, but try sudo /cdrom/...
06:30	<MasterShrek>	Augusta, it probably just has to download that much in packages
06:30	<Owner_>	any insight?
06:30	<silent>	tuntun, you could backup your package files
06:31	<DIguana>	They need to make apt use P2P for downloads. That'd prevent things from slowing to a crawl on Upgrade Day.
06:31	<silent>	tuntun, I can't remember where they are stored, however
06:31	<MasterShrek>	DIguana, that would be a HUGE security risk
06:31]  * nickrud used a beta disk, been here before
06:31	<meta-paonia>	Owner_ is it a USB keyboard
06:31	<riotkittie>	indeed it would
06:31	<Owner_>	ps2 but the mouse is usb
06:31	<tuntun>	silent: somethin' automated tho...
06:31	<Owner_>	and the mouse works
06:31]  * riotkittie hugs her tribe5 iso 
06:31	<nickrud>	tuna-fish: save /var/cache/apt/archives
06:31	<silent>	tuntun, all you would have to do is install... with a simple bash script
06:32	<nickrud>	erm, tuntun ^^
06:32]  * MasterShrek hugs his warty warthog cd
06:32	<meta-paonia>	Owner_ you might try plugging in a usb keyboard
06:32	<tuntun>	silent: probably still too complex for me:-D
06:32]  * IcemanV9 used RC iso; not much to update since then. :)
06:32	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, close the laptop monitor means ? switch off the laptop manitor or toggle?
06:32	<Owner_>	would be nice if i had one lol
06:32	<tuna-fish>	nickrud: yeah, i get it, we look so alike :)
06:32	<Augusta>	MasterShrek: so upgrading from an alternate cd won't solve my problem?
06:32	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, toggeling is not working in my laptop
06:32	<dWho>	nickrud : is there a script inside the cd named cdromupgrade.sh?
06:32	<cabezza>	I having problems to use oficial repos, they are slow. Why?
06:32]  * nickrud wishes he still had warty (and wonders at the 'noob' claim with warty ;)
06:32	<silent>	tuntun, I could make the script for you if you give me the package names
06:32	<MasterShrek>	indraveni, i dont know if it would work or not, worth a try though
06:33	<nickrud>	dWho: don't know, I thought you did ;)
06:33	<Owner_>	ok i will try and get a usb to ps2 adapter for the mouse be back in a bit and ill let you know how it worked out
06:33	<riotkittie>	cabezza: uhhh. because 7.10 was just released, maybe
06:33	<MasterShrek>	Augusta, i dont know for sure, it may
06:33	<MasterShrek>	never done it that way Augusta
06:33	<Geoffrey2>	anyone know if the SB600 induced kernel crash has been fixed yet?
06:33	<silent>	oh good god mary jane makes music so lovely
06:33	<tuna-fish>	cabezza: because a couple of dozens of millions are upgrading to gutsy
06:33	<Jordan_U_>	tuntun, apt-cd
06:33]  * abhibera is on Gutsy! :)
06:33	<Dyus>	MasterShrek, why would it be a security risk, games like wow use BT for patches and updates, isint it the same principle?
06:33	<meta-paonia>	indraveni - you may need to setup xinearama and drag the video to the second screen
06:33	<dWho>	nickrud : i was just askin because the command gksu or sudo or gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" doen't do anyting..
06:33	<Jordan_U_>	tuntun, nvm, that's not what I meant
06:34	<adminn>	I dont see compiz in gconf-editor why?????
06:34	<dWho>	nickrud : i have my cd mounted...
06:34	<troxor>	haru: still want the applet?
06:34	<indraveni>	meta-paonia, how to do that ?
06:34	<catid>	is this the right channel for problems with the fiesty 7.10 upgrade?
06:34	<nickrud>	dWho: ls /cdrom , do you see it? (but if it wasn't there and sudo was working as expected, you'd get an error)
06:34	<musikgoat>	catid: yes
06:34	<arun__>	abhibera: how do you like gutsy so far
06:34	<indraveni>	MasterShrek, to my bad luck, there is no monitor switch off button in my laptop
06:34	<Jordan_U_>	tuntun, aptoncd
06:35	<nickrud>	dWho: try sudo ls   (just those two words)
06:35	<MasterShrek>	Dyus, no, in torrents the files need to be the same, p2p they dont, and i would never download a package off of someone who i didnt know, thats why they have gpg keys and stuff
06:35	<catid>	hanging on Backing up any LVM2 metadata that may exist...

06:35	<nickrud>	adminn: cuz compiz is much newer than dapper

06:42	<dystopianray>	OrTigaS: you want help doing something in windows, that is what #windows is for
06:43	<MasterShrek>	OrTigaS, ubuntu will take about 600 floppies

It shows as not needing updates, but all of the software never finished installing and it destroyed some of my previous applications. Does someone know what i can do to know if i fully upgraded to gusty?
06:44	<Avariel>	i have a problem with my external monitor...im using a DVI cable connected to my laptop...and this blurry shadelike bouncy thing appears in the lower left corner...but not when i load windows
06:44	<dga>	nickrud: thanks
06:44	<silent>	yes kids, sorry to disappoint you... I'm afraid linux does still require some know-how.. but no more than figuring out how to do things in windows.. suck it up, its a part of the linux experience, and a cost I'd gladly pay for such high-quality programming
06:44	<nickrud>	bluebanana: hard to say which has more issues here
06:44	<Jordan_U_>	bluebanana, Upgrading right now will take a looong time since the repos are bogged down :)

06:44	<bluebanana>	MasterShrek, If there's no advantage to doing fresh install of 7.10, as opposed to upgrading, then why is it advised in some places on ubuntu forums?

06:44	<zak>	ok ill try that
06:45	<nickrud>	bluebanana: never mind me, Jordan_U hit the essential point
06:45	<OrTigaS>	its like rawrite
06:45	<bluebanana>	Jordan_U, i don't mind. i'll just go to bed and let it complete in 24 hours!!! how do i upgrade
06:45	<silent>	ia1, first time on linux?
06:45	<riotkittie>	Fred_Nerk: wired? wireless?
06:45	<pastyhermit>	Fred_Nerk: does it show up in ifconfig?
06:45	<Fred_Nerk>	wired
06:45	<Fred_Nerk>	eth0 shows up in ifconfig

06:45	<bluebanana>	nickrud, you're saying the the biggest problem is download/upgrade speed?
06:45	<pengo>	silent: err.. high quality programming doesn't require you to edit config files.. or cause half the screen to be black

06:46	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, youll always have the config, and you can go back and trim out modules that you dont want
06:46	<Fred_Nerk>	pastyhermit: it has a link light, and ethtool shows it has a link
06:46	<pastyhermit>	also check to see what your switch is set to.
06:46	<riotkittie>	awww Evanlec is compiling a kernel. how cute. :D
06:46	<bluebanana>	Jordan_U, upgrade should be done in 20 hours, you reckon?
06:46	<nickrud>	bluebanana: upgrade keeps and upgrades all your current packages, you don't have to reselect & reinstall. For me, that's the defining line
06:46	<novanosis>	This is horrible how do you people not make flash work off the bat in your new release? It makes no sense.
06:46	<Jordan_U_>	XsteelWolf, That will get you gcc, make and the like, it won't get you a DE ( but that's why you have vim ;)
06:46	<pastyhermit>	If you set it manually can you ping your gateway?

06:47	<tritium>	Avariel: overloaded servers

06:47	<bluebanana>	nickrud, is there a way to do an upgrade that mimics a fresh install?
06:47	<nickrud>	bluebanana: incomplete ones, many traceable to automatix & envy I believe.

06:50	<adminn>	what do I do now?????
06:50	<dWho>	XsteelWOlf gksu gedit
06:51	<pastyhermit>	whats that stupid gnome command to get the trash and home an dcomputer on my desktop
06:51	<novanosis>	ial yes im using the 64 bit Gutsy and FLASH is not working off the bat, and I read that it should. Then I try some simple "scripts" to no avil.
06:51	<adminn>	http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Xgl-Compiz-Dapper   ???
06:51	<MasterShrek>	XsteelWolf, you need to use sudo to edit files in there, save it somewhere else then sudo mv   the file
06:51	<pastyhermit>	gconf-settings or somethingn.
06:51	<volantares>	is it a known issue with nvidia cards?
06:51	<volantares>	btw?
06:51	<Jordan_U_>	Are the medibuntu repos down?
06:51	<thanatan_>	MasterShrek, I tried taking out splash and quiet, and it started to load the kernel to 7% then got stuck, so Im guessing the iso is curropt, but i did the md5sum to check it, but the site doesnt have the hash's for ubuntu 7.10, anways i got this, d2334dbba7313e9abc8c7c072d2af09c  ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso, maybe someone else has it that can compare?
06:51	<nickrud>	XsteelWolf: you would start the editor with gksudo (like gsudo gedit. never use sudo for gui apps)
06:51	<XsteelWolf>	how do i use sudo to edit if im gui
06:51	<adminn>	I need compiz
06:51	<silent>	novanosis, that has always a problem, sorry they advertised that
06:51	<Jordan_U_>	XsteelWolf, gksu
06:51	<riotkittie>	pastyhermit: you can do it with gnome configuration editor
06:51	<wtvr>	XsteelWolf: open up a terminal
06:51	<adminn>	aka beryl lol
06:51	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu and a USB mouse works fine in the same port (and all the others). If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
06:52	<Jordan_U_>	XsteelWolf, There is also a nautilus script to add it as a right click option
06:52	<volantares>	ok, well i'll go and try that. thanks MasterShrek and Jordan_U
06:52	<riotkittie>	beryl != compiz && compiz !=compiz-fusion
06:52	<wtvr>	XsteelWolf: or isit that you want to use a gui editor?
06:52	<MasterShrek>	thanatan, md5 looks fine
06:52	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, k im setting 3 options, processor type to p4..the 1000hz thing, and the Preemptible Kernel (low-latency desktop) option
06:52	<XsteelWolf>	yea gui editor
06:52	<bluebanana>	can anyone tell me: What are the advantages, if any, of doing a fresh install of Ubuntu 7.10, when one can do an upgrade? Thank you..
06:52	<adminn>	how should I get compiz guys?????<<<<

06:52	<alpha>	Hi - Is it ok to share a printer on my linux box to my locall network? I have (3) computers on my local network - (2) Linux & (1) Windoze - they all are hoioked to the same router that the broadband inter signal is always on. If I do this - my listen box warned that a certain port would be open to the internet. Ok to do or not ok?
06:52	<thanatan_>	join #compiz-fusion
06:52	<riotkittie>	adminn: is it not in the repos?
06:52	<Blama>	silent, What do you mean?
06:52	<nickrud>	riotkittie: a well written bash line
06:52	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, u did remember to load your previous config right?
06:52	<blueeraser>	I can access the ntfs filesystem on the drive i partitioned 7.10 onto, but i cant access my other drive... any suggestions?

06:52	<adminn>	I added to repo but I got a 404 from term lmao
06:53	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, yea...pretty sure i did that right...
06:53	<MasterShrek>	cool
06:53	<silent>	Blama, how do you know the error is on the keyboard and not another usb device?

06:53	<nickrud>	bluebanana: reinstall
06:53	<abhibera>	bluebanana: no!!!
06:53	<wtvr>	XsteelWolf: why not just use vi or nano or something like that?
06:53	<Jordan_U_>	alpha, It's not available to the internet if you are NAT'd ( behind a router )
06:53	<MasterShrek>	thanatan, no, what?
06:53	<bluebanana>	abhibera, "no" to what? to what nickrud said?
06:53	<pengo>	wow
06:53	<[Ramy]>	how i can use ubufox ?
06:54	<abhibera>	bluebanana: obviously very different compilers were used for making the 32 bit and 64 it versions. u will have to reinstall
06:54	<novanosis>	Who can tell me how to view the nvidia menu and see if gutsy can show me my info on the card?
06:54	<MasterShrek>	ubufox?

06:54	<riotkittie>	bluebanana: you cant upgrade from a 32bit to a 64bit AFAIK. i may be wrong, but i think you have to do a clean install
06:54	<DARKGuy>	hey guys, I'm really IMPRESSED by the effort made in Gutsy, congratulations!!!! :D
06:54	<Fred_Nerk>	pastyhermit: ok i forced the interface to 10/half and i can see traffic with tcpdump, but still can't seem to send anything.. pinging the default gateway shows nothing on eth0, but it shows up the EUNREACH messages if i do "tcpdump -i any -n icmp"
06:54	<XsteelWolf>	how do i run nano in gui other than terminal?

06:54	<TabooTreez>	I cant mount my ntfs partition on gusty can anyone help?
06:54	<MasterShrek>	thanatan_, i told u the md5 looked fine, u may just have to use the alternate cd
06:54	<riotkittie>	you dont run nano in the gui
06:54	<Jordan_U_>	XsteelWolf, gksudo gedit /path/to/file
06:54	<DARKGuy>	I have a small question tho... ^^; is there another way to optimize my system up a little more, other than tuning up the ext3 fs ?

06:54	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu?

If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
06:54	<Evanlec>	riotkittie, i think that is incorrect...u must clean install for 64-bit
06:54	<dga>	nickrud: now when i go to restricted manager, i get "could not apply changes! fix broken packages first." when i try to install my ati driver. any thoughts on this one?
06:54	<nickrud>	XsteelWolf: you might as well get used to the idea that if you run ubuntu, you'll become familiar with a terminal
06:54	<bluebanana>	should i install 64 bit ubuntu if i have a 64 bit computer? I think a year or 6 months ago, I was told to just use 32 bit. Please advise a newbie. Thank you
06:54	<MasterShrek>	riotkittie, you are right, u cannot upgrade 32 to 64
06:55	<Jordan_U_>	DARKGuy, Feed it powerthirst
06:55	<blueeraser>	taboo, can you see the drive in the file browser?
06:55	<thanatan_>	MasterShrek: oh must've not seen what you said, sorry, and I'm downloading the alternate cd, thanks for the help
06:55	<riotkittie>	Evanlec: think what is incorrect? o_O
06:55	<nickrud>	dga: in a terminal, sudo apt-get update (first)
06:55	<dga>	nickrud: did that
06:55	<DARKGuy>	Jordan_U, lol, if they'd only sell it here :p
06:55	<abhibera>	bluebanana: 64 bit is for the geek factor
06:55	<Madpilot>	bluebanana, stick with 32bit
06:55	<ia1>	bluebanana: 32 bit is the safer choice
06:55	<XsteelWolf>	nickrud, nano can't search and replace and can't jump to line
06:55	<riotkittie>	terminals are awesome. say it with me, kids.
06:55	<MasterShrek>	thanatan_, i said it to thanatan without the _ =)

06:55	<alpha>	Jordan_U_ - Good to go then - running a very nice D-Link Gigabit Wireless router - looking at security in the router looks great - thx bunch...

=== thanatan_ is now known as thanatan
06:55	<bluebanana>	Madpilot, why should i stick with 32 bit ubuntu if i have 64 bit computer?
06:55	<nickrud>	bluebanana: I'd write them to a dvd/cd
06:55	<IcemanV9>	ia1: that's normal around the release day ... it'll tamper down a bit later
06:55	<novanosis>	Who can tell me how to view the nvidia menu and see if gutsy can show me my info on the card?
06:55	<Evanlec>	riotkittie, that he can upgrade from 32 to 64
06:55	<abhibera>	bluebanana: many h/w still don't use 64 bit drivers
06:55	<bluebanana>	ia1, how is 32 bit the safer choice?
06:55]  * MasterShrek would make love to the cli if he could...
06:56	<adminn>	iceman: it worked now what?
06:56	<riotkittie>	bluebanana: do you have a usb drive? another partition you can copy them to? burn them to a dvd-rw ?
06:56	<wtvr>	XsteelWolf: why not use a non-gui editor?  once you learn them - they are great.. especially for config files and doing the things you mentioned
06:56	<abhibera>	bluebanana: also Java and Flash isn't there for 64
06:56	<nickrud>	perverts everywhere I look
06:56	<Evanlec>	bluebanana, there is no reason except java in my option
06:56	<adminn>	icemanv9: it worked now what
06:56	<Madpilot>	bluebanana, because 64bit isn't as complete - esp. for stuff like Flash & Java
06:56	<Avariel>	anyone have trouble with an external monitor ? there is this annoying mirrory bumpy glitch in my screen and its driving me mad
06:56	<thanatan>	MasterShrek: oh haha, k, this channel is really crazy but really helpful
06:56	<riotkittie>	Evanlec: i didnt say it was correct. :P
06:56	<abhibera>	bluebanana: u will have to use beta flash players which don't work as well
06:56	<Jordan_U_>	bluebanana, Most proprietary stuff doesn't work ( easily ) in 64 bit
06:56	<abhibera>	bluebanana: stick with 32
06:56	<Evanlec>	correction....Flash works FINE....java is the problem only
06:56]  * xTheGoat121x agrees with MasterShrek... though not at the same time... or even to the same cli
06:56	<nickrud>	you can still fool firefox into using a 32bit java
06:56	<DARKGuy>	it actually depends on your hardware.... but most stuff works - my system is 64-bit and I have working java & FF (Swiftweasel) & flash and everything thanks to Kilz.
06:56	<MasterShrek>	Madpilot, what else besides flash and java?
06:56	<abhibera>	bluebanana: when 64 bit becomes the in thing
06:56	<bluebanana>	Jordan_U, what do you mean by "proprietary stuff"
06:56	<ia1>	IcemanV9: just seems that IRC isn't really able to handle this, so many conversation threads at once, just doesn't cope
06:56	<abhibera>	bluebanana: then use it

If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
06:56	<MasterShrek>	lol @  xTheGoat121x sloppy sudo seconds
06:56	<DARKGuy>	however my webcam doesn't work with it :p
06:56	<XsteelWolf>	wtvr, i need search and replace function
06:57	<DARKGuy>	so it has its downsides :P
06:57	<IcemanV9>	adminn: there is setting/config manager somewhere ... i don't remember
06:57	<nickrud>	!omg
06:57	<bluebanana>	abhibera, so you mean 64 bit isn't the in thing yet? I thought most comps being sold now are 64 bit, no?
06:57	<riotkittie>	i wouldnt go for the 64bit version unless you actually have need for it
06:57	<Madpilot>	MasterShrek, thsoe are the two main ones - propeitary apps like that
06:57	<wtvr>	XsteelWolf: vim does search and replace no problem
06:57	<pengo>	ubuntu 7.10 is the first version in 3 years to boot up on this Dell Lattitude L400.. albiet a lot slower than 4.10 live cd did.. and only in safe-graphics mode
06:57	<bluebanana>	If I don't care about java or flash, should I go for 64 bit ubuntu?
06:57	<Avariel>	this blind-like moving glitch i just dont know what its caused by ! its on my external monitor..
06:57	<abhibera>	bluebanana: no it's not yet the in thing. many programs and drivers are still for 32 bit processors
06:57	<MasterShrek>	Madpilot, i dont have anything else besides java plugin in firefox working in 64 bit
06:57	<blueeraser>	im having trouble getting any information off of my second hard drive.  it shows the drive when i go into computer file browser, but when i click it, i get an admin pop-up window on the toolbar then it disappears and nothing happens, i cant access it
06:57	<Jordan_U_>	DARKGuy, swiftweasel?!? That is practically an oxymoron given the point of iceweasel
06:57	<XsteelWolf>	wtvr, vim = vi?
06:57	<novanosis>	Who can tell me how to view the nvidia menu and see if gutsy can show me my info on the card?
06:58	<ia1>	bluebanana: well most people have 32 bit, as someone was just saying, eg. Flash is hard to get working in 64 bit.   why bother?  if it runs a TINY bit faster meh.  I wouldn't give up hours/days of my life solving problems, or live without certain technologies, just to know I'm "using my hardware to the fullest"
06:58	<[Ramy]>	Jordan_U_ can i launch that from firefox ?
06:58	<Evanlec>	bluebanana, if u dont care about those then definitely
06:58	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu?

06:58	<MasterShrek>	bluebanana, yes, and flash will work with minor tweaking, actualyl gutsy can install it really easily
06:58	<wtvr>	XsteelWolf: vi = very improved vi (or something like that)
06:58	<riotkittie>	Blama: i cant give you any answers here, but ... what kind of keyboard?
06:58	<tuntun>	Jordan_U_/ubotu/silent/nickrud: So can APTonCD replace superceded packages dynamically on a cdrw??
06:58	<nickrud>	XsteelWolf: you can use the gui app for editing system files, just call it from a terminal so you can give it permission. gsudo gedit
06:58	<DARKGuy>	Jordan_U, yeah, I dunno o,o it works and I like it... it's faster than FF and I can't remember why I didn't choose iceweasel before
06:58	<Blama>	riotkittie, COmpaq Multimedia

06:58	<Evanlec>	Jordan_U, are u saying that cuz he's using flash?
06:58	<MasterShrek>	enjoy your new 7.10's!
06:58	<abhibera>	mscdex: why did u upgrade? u know it's problematic. i always recommend fresh install
06:58	<mscdex>	and now i basically have a laptop in limbo
06:58]  * xTheGoat121x says "Good night MasterShrek!"
06:58	<bluebanana>	OK. let me see if i understand.  The only problem I have with Installing 64 bit ubuntu  is with java and flash. But even java and flash can be fixed easily on 64 bit ubuntu.
06:59	<mscdex>	i did not know it was problematic
06:59	<nickrud>	tuntun: it just makes it easy to move files to another machine without redownloading them
06:59	<thanatan>	MasterShrek: i will as soon as the alternate downloads :P
06:59	<DARKGuy>	Jordan_U, they released 64-bit packages with java/flash compatibility? I think that was what took me to swiftweasel, Kilz had some scripts to make java and flash work with it
06:59	<Evanlec>	ia1, correction, flash is EASY to get working in gutsy-64-bit
06:59	<saxi1>	MasterShrek: I will :)
06:59	<Jordan_U_>	Evanlec, No, I'm saying that because swiftfox violates the MPL http://www.getswiftfox.org/
06:59	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: actually, my ttys don't work reliably any more.
06:59	<bluebanana>	will ubuntu 64 bit one day be as problem-free as 32 bit ubuntu?

07:03	<nickrud>	Pie-rate: you and me both. Did you experiment with splashy?
07:03	<kilopopo>	how do i install w32 codec here?
07:03	<Samuli^>	hey guys, I've asked a zillion times but here goes again: Could someone help me set up my soundserver (or what it is called)?

If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62". It is a Compaq Multimedia Keyboard
07:03	<ian1>	kilopopo: if you play an unsupported file won't it just ask you if you want to install them?
07:04	<Pie-rate>	nickrud: yes, it didn't work. i don't care enough about splash screens to try to get one working, i think i'll sell my laptop while its still worth something.

07:15	<Evanlec>	dr_gonzo, probly...
07:15	<sorsis>	is there any way to check whole my installation integrity with checksums or something similar?

07:17	<ChrisGordon>	my update manager is telling me I need to reinstall it, where can i get this?
07:17	<ian1>	dr_gonzo: there's a chance that the utilities that come with nvidia/ati cards support that funktastic mode that I've never heard of but I wouldn't count on it :D
07:18	<Avariel>	system preferences screen resolution

07:19	<Haruno>	i updated to gutsy and my geforce 7800 gtx doesnt work any more - i'm not that command line proofed with linux, yet
07:19	<riotkittie>	DARKGuy: it is missing /some/ things but it's pretty complete.
07:19	<codename>	I got some boot problems with Ubuntu
07:19	<jburd>	dr_gonzo: That's a personal decision.
07:19	<Fade2Black>	how do i install aptget
07:19	<kdubois>	caner: if you have it installed right, then yes. Can you find others having this same problem?
07:19	<DARKGuy>	riotkittie, oh, what things? I wanna know xD
07:19	<josenj76>	How can I install "gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad"? I get "broken packages" error under 7.10
07:19	<ChrisGordon>	martyvis, thanks but do i run those one at a time? (sorry, used to dos)
07:19	<martyvis>	XsteelWolf: one desktop for work, one for play, one for this project, one for that
07:19	<codename>	I got some boot problems with Ubuntu
07:19	<dr_gonzo>	i'm actually looking at is some kind of social experiment
07:19	<riotkittie>	DARKGuy: 3D windows, for one.
07:19	<robert_>	is there a package for autom4te or something?
07:19	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu and a USB mouse works fine in the same port (and all the others). If I plug it in at the command line I get the error "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62". It is a Compaq Multimedia Keyboard
07:20	<XsteelWolf>	martyvis, one for watching porn?
07:20	<caner>	<kdubois>	yes there are on launchpads bugs section
07:20	<martyvis>	ChrisGordon: yep - 1st the update, then the upgrde
07:20	<DARKGuy>	riotkittie, darn, they were cool :(
07:20	<dr_gonzo>	any link to a hardware compatibility list?
07:20	<Night_XX>	however..I already try sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev and it still say to me "Unable to find the GTK+ installation."
07:20	<Flannel>	!hardware | dr_gonzo
07:20	<ubotu>	dr_gonzo: For lists of supported hardware on Ubuntu see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport
07:20	<pengo>	is there a way to install the "alternate" way (via command line) from the standard desktop cd?
07:20	<dr_gonzo>	ahh
07:20	<caner>	<kdubois>	the bug is waiting to be verified i think
07:20	<ChrisGordon>	thank you martyvis, you have probly made my night 3 hours shorter :D
07:20]  * robert_ riots with riotkittie :P
07:20	<dr_gonzo>	!hardware
07:20	<Flannel>	dr_gonzo: but, its probably not perfectly up to date
07:20	<kilopopo>	anyone got compiz fusion running?
07:20	<chowmeined>	meh
07:20	<chowmeined>	everyone left :(
07:20	<martyvis>	ChrisGordon: :-)
07:20	<josenj76>	How can I install "gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad"? I get "broken packages" error under 7.10
07:21]  * CowzRule LIKE GUTSY :)
07:21]  * riotkittie uhm... robs with robert_ 
07:21	<inspired>	hi. I just upgraded to Gutsy and fonts suddenly look different. an example is Firefox where the font seems thinner than it did in feisty. any idea what could cause this? was it changed on purpose?
07:21	<kilopopo>	anyone got compiz fusion running?
07:21	<kdubois>	Night_XX: you might be better helped by the friendly folks in #ubuntu-it
07:21	<tuntun>	Can I get desktop icons to conform to a single grid ala windows -- and also make all icons a single size so it doesn't look so random?
07:21	<rredd4>	nkryptd1 Try in terminal type   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
07:21	<chowmeined>	inspired: i noticed that too
07:21	<Haruno>	dr_gonzo: what doesnt work with you? the GUI?
07:21	<dougb>	is there an easier way to rip CD's to your computer in 7.10?
07:21	<martyvis>	kilopopo: yep - it just runs
07:21	<chowmeined>	dougb: sound juicer doesnt work?
07:21	<caner>	<inspired>	they have changed the default fonts to Sans
07:21	<dougb>	chowmeined: sorry, i meant in MP3 format
07:21	<dougb>	it rips it in OGG
07:22	<martyvis>	kilopopo: need a supported 3d card - just enable desktop effects in prefernces
07:22	<Night_XX>	kdubois: in ubuntu-it everyone is sleeping ^^'
07:22	<inspired>	caner, aaah, from what font?
07:22	<chowmeined>	dougb: might be able to hack it together with cd paranoia
07:22	<Flannel>	pengo: No, but I heard something about booting straight to ubiquity, try entering `only-ubiquity` for a boot option at the boot menu
07:22	<WaltzingAlong>	8:22 too earlier for the italians? :D
07:22	<chowmeined>	dougb: though.. byte for byte.. ogg's sound quality is superior
07:22	<kdubois>	Night_XX: haha, we'll do our best here then
07:22	<robert_>	crap crap crap
07:22	<rredd4>	nkryptd1  when you get near the end you can select resolutionis
07:22	<robert_>	automake is broken
07:22	<caner>	<inspired>	it must be Bitsream Vera Sans but i am not sure
07:22	<DARKGuy>	dougb, mp3 isn't a free format, therefore the default is OGG because it's free and all that, but I think you can do it with some other programs and the needed codecs, provided you're allowed to get them legally o,o
07:22	<dougb>	chowmeined: tell that to my ipod :-P
07:22	<chowmeined>	dougb: and it will play better under linux
07:22	<neohaker>	hi thr ANy one runs counterstrike on UBUNTU??
07:22	<DARKGuy>	OGG sounds better tho :p
07:22	<chowmeined>	dougb: ah...
07:22	<kdubois>	caner: hmm, thats unfortunate. Intel has great OSS drivers, aTi's are coming down the pipes, but nvidia's are still closed up...
07:22	<dougb>	i know OGG sounds better, and i'm all for using it
07:22	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, I do, 1.6 no-steam
07:23	<tuntun>	Can I get desktop icons to conform to a single grid ala windows -- and also make all icons a single size so it doesn't look so random?
07:23	<mbt>	Anyone running Gutsy AMD64 having showstopper issues with OpenOffice.org?
07:23	<chowmeined>	dougb: you could rip to flac and transcode to mp3? :p
07:23	<dougb>	hmm maybe i'll just sell my ipod...i have a nokia n800 and i'm pretty sure those play OGG
07:23	<chowmeined>	dougb: have a flac music archive on your computer
07:23	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:how much fsp you egt
07:23	<DARKGuy>	tuntun, you can stretch them
07:23	<Night_XX>	kdubois in italy are 8:23 AM
07:23	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:wine or cedega?
07:23	<WaltzingAlong>	probably the audio is ripped to vorbis but in the ogg container. referring to them sholud be oggvorbis; other things can bet inside .ogg files like theora
07:23	<kdubois>	robert_ theres a lot of macros in dev packages you should look into getting if you want to get automake running smoothly
07:23	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, haven't checked but it's always almost the same I get on win
07:23	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, wine
07:23	<kilopopo>	martyvis, what program in the preference?
07:23	<chowmeined>	WaltzingAlong: or speex
07:23	<kdubois>	Night_XX: here in US its 230 am :-D
07:23	<youser>	if i download  gutsy through bittorrent can i upgrade from feisty without serious data loss?
07:23	<crayner>	hey guys
07:24	<robert_>	kdubois, like ..?
07:24	<macogw>	dougb: rockbox!
07:24	<riotkittie>	tuntun: right click on desktop, keep aligned ... for the grid. as for making them all a single size  without manually having to "stretch" each one, no clue. i have been looking for a meansn of doing  that myself
07:24	<JWay>	anyone other than me experiencing a weird problem switching between workspaces in the ubuntu 7.10 - just upgraded...???
07:24	<martyvis>	kilopopo: display i think (not running in a gui at the mo)
07:24	<chowmeined>	dougb: the irivers are really nice
07:24	<tuntun>	DARKGuy: I would prefer an automatic method:-$
07:24	<dougb>	does it play on the 5.5 80 GB ipods?
07:24	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i configured in my bro lappy it runs smooth
07:24	<macogw>	dougb: iPods can use Rockbox just fine
07:24	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i got better card
07:24	<crayner>	when i try to update to gutsy the update manager stops responding
07:24	<WaltzingAlong>	chowmeined: exactly. actually could you tell me how to get speex inside .ogg?
07:24	<kdubois>	robert_: it depends, whats it doing wrong?
07:24	<josenj76>	How can I install "gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad"? I get "broken packages" error under 7.10
07:24	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:but it truns bad :(
07:24	<chowmeined>	dougb: they play flac, ogg, mp3, aac everything
07:24	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, lucky for you :P mine's a GF4 Ti 4200
07:24	<nickrud>	youser: yes, no data loss, but you'll still end up getting packages off the net (the ones you got from the net for feisty)
07:24	<robert_>	kdubois, Can't locate object method "good_version" via package "Autom4te::C4che" at /usr/bin/autom4te line 984.
07:24	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:on my desktop :|
07:24	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, maybe it needs the drivers
07:24	<arooni>	folks: i have ubuntu 7.04 and 3 hard drives.  recently i have had to restart my computer via power button cuz it was freezing.  anyways, now: two hard drives don't show up in BIOS, *AND* when fsck runs on startup, it fails with exit status 8 (operational error) on the one hard drive the bios sitll sees.... which is the one that contains the root file system, home, swap .... any ideas on what i should do to fix?
07:24	<riotkittie>	JWay: hows about you tell us your problem, and we see if we can fix it
07:24	<Haruno>	theres a list of hardware not supported under gutsy right now (anymore)?
07:24	<jmworx>	WaltzingAlong: All the tools I know of put Speex in Ogg (.spx files are ogg files)
07:24	<youser>	hhmm
07:24	<caner>	<kdubois>	but if all the nvidia users have such problems with gutsy, it will not be good because the bug is really annoying
07:24	<DARKGuy>	tuntun, I dunno if Gutsy has an automatic way, Feisty didn't :/
07:25	<Flannel>	youser: If you have the desktop CD, you'dhave to reinstall (you could reinstall around your home partition, if you have a separate one), if you download the alternate CD, you can use that to upgrade from
07:25	<arooni>	oops
07:25	<kdubois>	robert, make sure autotools, libtool, etc are all installed properly. I was disappointed w/ what was installed by default
07:25	<Jordan_U_>	youser, If you download the DVD then you will have to grab from the repos for fewer packages
07:25	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:hey how did you isntall re
07:25	<youser>	i upgraded to feisty from a a dapper cd
07:25	<WaltzingAlong>	jmworx: ok great thanks
07:25	<kdubois>	caner: its likely just the type of card you have, mine is working pretty well
07:25	<crayner>	help
07:25	<Night_XX>	kdubois: we use to sleep in the night :)
07:25	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, try opening a terminal and type " glxinfo | grep 'render' " ... if it says Direct Rendering: Yes, then you have 3D acceleration, else you've got to find the drivers
07:25	<dougb>	yea idk if i want to invest in another mp3 player.  i just bought this nokia n800 and i can put up to 16 GB's of storage on it i think, which is a lot less than buying an MP3 player
07:25	<crayner>	my update manager crashes when updating to gutsy gibbon
07:25	<dougb>	i would have to think that the nokia N800 can play OGG since it's based of debian
07:25	<chowmeined>	dougb: ok
07:25	<youser>	i just want to keep my settings and home folder and windows boot
07:26	<kdubois>	Night_XX: yeah, but then we became hackers and replaced sleep with caffiene....
07:26	<ChrisGordon>	Ok, so I ran those 2 lines and I went back to try the update manger, and It still doesnt work...
07:26	<youser>	but update manager is poocheed
07:26	<JWay>	When I click on a workspace other than the primary, I get to see the background picture and no menu or nothing. Switching workspaces is not possible with ctrl + alt + left/right at all. I can run a terminal and use alt + f2 to run programs, but switching workspaces is completely impossible
07:26	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, if it's nVIDIA or ATI usually you go to System ->	Admin. ->	Restricted Drivers Manager
07:26	<platinum123>	i have a gutsy dvd - is it possible to upgrade my existing feisty without using the update manager to fetch the files online?
07:26	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:answer is yes
07:26	<robert_>	kdubois, I'm going to re-install automake, autoconf, and m4. anything else?
07:26	<sorsis>	dougb: N800 is based on debian??
07:26	<neohaker>	i installed drivers myself :|
07:26	<dougb>	yup yup
07:26	<Haruno>	crayner: maybe its not crashing, it can easily take *some* while...
07:26	<Night_XX>	kdubois: :DDD
07:26	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:mine is nvidai 6600gt
07:26	<crayner>	ok
07:26	<dougb>	sorsis: http://maemo.org/
07:26	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, huh, weird :| is the Video options in CS using Software, OpenGL or D3D? are you running it with Compiz enabled?
07:27	<chowmeined>	platinum123: yup
07:27	<DARKGuy>	*is=are
07:27	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:nope bro
07:27	<WaltzingAlong>	jmworx: is there such a tool as vorbisgain for speex?
07:27	<neohaker>	i cheked all that
07:27	<kdubois>	robert_ reinstalling is probably not the problem here, you might be missing a development package for whatever you're compiling. what are you trying to compile?
07:27	<tuntun>	DARKGuy/riotkittie: I have "keep aligned" selected, but I would like it the way it is in windows
07:27	<chowmeined>	platinum123: change your /etc/apt/sources.list to point to your dvd
07:27	<chowmeined>	platinum123: aptitude update && aptitude upgrade
07:27	<neohaker>	i myslef configured on myh bro lapppy he has 7600 card
07:27	<caner>	<kdubois>	it doesnt just blink and flash but gradually slows down resulting a crash
07:27	<robert_>	kdubois, dgen-sdl
07:27	<jmworx>	WaltzingAlong: Not that I know of
07:27	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:but actual glxgears says my brd performance better :(
07:27	<DARKGuy>	tuntun, ah, automatic ordering? I don't think they've added that to nautilus yet :(
07:27	<Flannel>	platinum123: `sudo apt-cdrom add` should add it (even though its a dvd)

07:28	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:still i get bad fps he gets 100
07:28	<robert_>	kdubois, the version that apt installs segfaults
07:28	<ChrisGordon>	I tried doing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade and that didnt fix my manager
07:28	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, hm, try changing the video stuff to D3D or OpenGL and see (in CS)
07:28	<kdubois>	caner, it doesnt do that w/ a geforce 8500. also make sure you have the right driver installed, you may need a legacy one...
07:28	<snadge>	how come i can telnet to port 80 of a website and GET / .. but firefox just stalls and times out.. sometimes when i telnet to a  host, it resolves as 1.0.0.0 .. then if i ping it the correct ip comes up.. gutsy 64bit.. any ideas?
07:28	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:mylaunghing options itslf has opengl :(
07:28	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, I would've said it's the drivers but you have 3D acceleration so it's not that and I'm running out of clues xD
07:28	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i removed cs
07:28	<mbt>	Anyone running Gutsy AMD64 having showstopper issues with OpenOffice.org?  I am experiencing very frequent and hard crashes when I do just about anything in it.
07:28	<chowmeined>	snadge: proxy?
07:29	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, you could try asking in #winehq, they're the wine gurus and might help you a bit more :$
07:29	<snadge>	no proxy is required.. windows xp and ubuntu feisty works fine on the exact same machine
07:29	<caner>	<kdubois>	i didnt select it. just installed using restricted drivers manager
07:29	<rayb0t>	i'm installing gutsy right now, it's at the "scanning the mirror" part, and its taking forever. is this due to the load on the servers?
07:29	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i:D
07:29	<chowmeined>	snadge: no for some reason do you have the proxy enabled
07:29	<robert_>	kdubois, the problem is that config.guess doesn't correctly identify my host/cpu type.
07:29	<youser>	so i can download gutsy from torrent and either run or install it? i cant download the upgrade managerr files? via torrent?
07:29	<snadge>	its set to direct connection.. does this on both livecd and after install
07:29	<mbt>	rayb0t: I would presume so.  Installing packages has been very slow for me tonight, too.
07:29	<josenj76>	I'm tring to install XChat in 7.10 but I'm getting "tcl8.4 not installable" error
07:29	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:hey which wine version?
07:29	<tarelerulz>	I am have problems with my wireless card in ubuntu .  It worked before ,but I have changed wireless routers .   my wireless cardworks under windows ,but not ubuntu . It worked with my wirless router before .  I have not changed anything besides the router . Oh and my lan port don't work either so I am . can I just install wirelles card  and then use programs to see the wirelless router and connects me to it or do I have to use iwconfig
07:29	<ubuntu_>	hai
07:29	<rayb0t>	mbt: yeah. i dont need any packages, i just need to finish the install. it should have a "skip this part" button :P
07:30	<rayb0t>	or maybe it should time out faster
07:30	<rredd4>	ChrisGordon  you can go to Synaptic, remove update manager and reinstall it
07:30	<ubuntu_>	do want my ubantu freeeeee versions
07:30	<tuntun>	DARKGuy/riotkittie: automatic ordering. I don't think thats it, I would prefer it that desktop icons cant become slightly mis allingned
07:30	<robert_>	perfect
07:30	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, 0.9.47, latest one
07:30	<kdubois>	robert_ you may also want to try other versions of automake. some sources only work w/ older versions, its why they're still in the repos...
07:30	<ubuntu_>	thanks
07:30	<mbt>	rayb0t: True.  I think that part of the setup is to create the cache of available packages from the servers.
07:30	<rayb0t>	probably
07:30	<youser>	right now feisty runs fine but my  video card isnot compaatible
07:30	<rayb0t>	still, the actual installation only took 10 mins, this is going on 20
07:30	<robert_>	checking build system type... Invalid configuration `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu': machine `x86_64-unknown' not recognized
07:30	<Haruno>	rayb0t, these packages ARE gutsy, id say

07:30	<rayb0t>	Haruno: haha yeah
07:30	<kdubois>	youser: what gfx card?
07:31	<mbt>	rayb0t: Yeah, I installed smartmontools and it took me like 15 min or so
07:31	<youser>	geforce 5500
07:31	<DARKGuy>	tuntun, hm, have you tried opening a Nautilus window (home folder or any will do) and going to Preferences, and changing the icon zoom level/factor ? that changes the size of the grid making it more "flexible" and windows-like. I use 75% and then resize the icons manually to my taste :D
07:31	<meta-paonia>	Radion 200 has problems too
07:31	<kdubois>	youser: yeah, thats a legacy card you've got :-D
07:31	<mbt>	rayb0t: The sad part is that I might have to roll back to Feisty if I can't get OOo to run properly
07:31	<youser>	"desktop effects" was a white screenn
07:31	<snadge>	ok if i use firefox to browse the web, it doesnt work.. if i put the ip address in instead of the host name.. it works, but if i ping the hostname from the command line, it correctly resolves the ip.. surely im not the only one experiencing this?
07:31	<rayb0t>	mbt: that sounds like loads of fun

07:32	<kdubois>	youser: white/black screens in 3d accelerated windows are likely due to a lack of texture rendering memory

07:32	<mbt>	Yep... I have to have OOo for school, and really I need a lot of the functionality in Gutsy, too.  But I haven't been able to talk it into working right.

07:33	<Haruno>	i boot and theres no graphical interface, im not *so* used to linux command line, so id like a gui much more ^^
07:33	<ChrisGordon>	rred44: it says the package opera needs to be reinstalled
07:33	<rredd4>	mrj  its installed and animations is enabled,  how do I use it now?

07:33	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, How badly? Can you give an example?
07:33	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i cnat go back and play on windows :(((
07:34	<mrj>	rredd4, you go through it and figure out what shortcuts = what animation you want and use the shortcuts
07:34	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, naaah, it's just a small video/WINE issue, easy to fix for them :p
07:34	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: they are 1 1/2 pages (so uses 2 pages when printing) instead of 1
07:34	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, you could try asking tomorrow, at 2:37 am I doubt someone could be alive there XD
07:34	<kdubois>	neohaker: not really, wine and cedega do a decent job with old games, i just use an xbox if i feel the need to game these days....
07:34	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:was struggling now evrything is mess over here
07:34	<ubuntu_>	hi my graphics will not work properly in ubantu wt ica do
07:34	<josenj76>	thanks tech_1
07:34	<tarelerulz>	can you save whole web pages with firefox. I have some instructions for install my wirelless card on ndiswrapper and I want it in the same format.  In text document it don't do that well. The reason is I don't have web when I got to ubuntu .
07:34	<XsteelWolf>	How do i freeze compiz when doing an effect to take screenshot?it's hard to press windows key then all the way to prtsc key
07:34	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: and some of them are wrapped way over, when before they fit fine on the page
07:34	<TECH_1>	Give it a try josenj.
07:34	<tuntun>	DARKGuy/riotkittie: sort of like, you cant have to desktop icons touching, and the all have to be aligned both horiz and vert.
07:34	<platinum123>	lame - it is always hanging at " Stopping MySQL database server mysqld"
07:34	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, If you want them to be exactly the same then you shouldn't use a document format, you should use a digital paper format like PDF
07:34	<ubuntu_>	thank u all by byyyyyy
07:35	<frojnd>	I have a q. I will install gutsy on my new laptop. What directories from this PC (feisty) do I have to copy on lap top (gutsy) that I'll so I'll have the same programs there?
07:35	<riotkittie>	tarelerulz: yes, you can save whole web pages with firefox. go to file menu, and save there and you should get some options.
07:35	<kdubois>	XsteelWolf: ccsm should have a screenshot plugin....
07:35	<neohaker>	kdubois:yup your write the most digusting my bro plays on his lappy same game 10 fps with loewr performing card then mine :P
07:35	<riotkittie>	tarelerulz: although i think you get them if you right click >	save too
07:35	<pengo>	would I be wrong In guessing that virtualization hasn't yet come to a point where i can have linux and windows running side by side happily and sharing resources on the one desktop PC easily?
07:35	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: but i was working on it...
07:35	<youser>	ah well gutsy probably woulnt have solved my graphic problems anyways peace im out
07:35	<mbt>	frojnd: If you want the same programs, just export the selections list from the first machine and import it into the other one.
07:35	<Haruno>	mrj: see above ^^
07:35	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, What do you mean?
07:35	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:anyidea what next thing i can do
07:35	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: i was writing my paper, then i upgraded
07:35	<ChrisGordon>	ok, I think cd upgrading will solve my package problem but, it doesnt recognize the cd i made...
07:36	<Samuli^>	pengo, I used to have that with virtualbox
07:36	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: now i have to reformat it
07:36	<frojnd>	mbt,  where is selection list
07:36	<caner>	how can i detect my gpu's name, verison, etc...
07:36	<mrj>	pengo, uh, virtualization has been like that for about 4 years now
07:36	<mrj>	if not longer
07:36	<Samuli^>	pengo, worked quite fine
07:36	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, It's not like it added or removed formatting, it is just using more space
07:36	<riotkittie>	pengo: i had no probs running xp in vmware server. not that it lasted long [i had no reason to do it]
07:36	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, try installing your video drivers through the restricted drivers manager, try changing video options in CS, try fullscreen or windowed, different color depths, stuff like that
07:36	<murlidhar>	morning all!!!
07:36	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: so i have to resize a bunch of stuff
07:36	<pengo>	ah vmware yeah
07:36	<mrj>	Haruno, you honestly think i'm going to scroll up in the 1000 lines a minute and look for one line of text to help you?
07:36	<mbt>	frojnd: If both machines are on the same network, you can do it like this, from the machine that you have the software on already:
07:36	<inigomontoya>	guys, question, how can i make sure that a startup program starts BEFORE all others?
07:37	<Haruno>	pengo: nope, this point doesnt really exist, yet ;)
07:37	<mbt>	frojnd: apt-get --get-selections | ssh target-machine 'sudo apt-get --set-selections; sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade'
07:37	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: oh well...
07:37	<Haruno>	mrj: >	i boot and theres no graphical interface, im not *so* used to linux command line, so id like a gui much more ^^
07:37	<riotkittie>	but virtualbox is supposed to be good, too. and there are others i've heard positive reviews of from users ... but <shrug>
07:37	<alastair_>	anyone having issues with 'cdromupgrade'?
07:37	<mrj>	Haruno, what did you do before the GUI "broke"
07:37	<pengo>	is virtualbox proprietary like vmware?
07:37	<Samuli^>	plus virtualbox is really easy to install
07:37	<alastair_>	I'm getting it hanging at "modifying software channels"
07:38	<smmagic>	I can't get my windows Xp VM to install!
07:38	<Haruno>	mrj: install gutsy via update manager and then reboot ;)
07:38	<Samuli^>	and from what I've heard faster than vmware
07:38	<riotkittie>	ugh. i want to go to bed but i cant lay down. so.  i suppose i will sit here and learn something.
07:38	<rayb0t>	alastair_: mine is hanging at "scanning the mirror" i think it is because of the load on the severs.
07:38	<endra>	hello
07:38	<inigomontoya>	roitkittie: i've got a video of virtualbox running on youtube
07:38	<frojnd>	mbt; ok what about just burning APTs on disc ? is tehre a way?
07:38	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, You can usually format things so that even adding / removing text wont completely ruin the format
07:38	<ChrisGordon>	alastair: yea i cant get mine to work, doesnt show up
07:38	<Haruno>	virtualbox is quite good, u just need pretty much RAM
07:38	<Lunz>	how do i write enable my usb drive?i cant save my file in usb drive,can someone help?
07:38	<alastair_>	rayb0t: I specifically told it to not use the internet for that reason
07:38	<mbt>	frojnd: You can just save the selections list to disk
07:38	<josenj76>	There are alot of packages that are "not installable" in 7.10  I can't install tcl8.4 for example
07:38	<endra>	if I have a VIDEO_TS directory how can I make a .img or .iso of it so that if I play or burn the .img or .iso it would work on vlc/dvd player?
07:38	<mrj>	Haruno, go through sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm again
07:39	<mbt>	frojnd: apt-get --get-selections >	file_output
07:39	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: it just seems all the stuff is bigger and flows off of the areas i wanted it now
07:39	<rayb0t>	alastair_: just give it time, mine just now got past it after about 10 mins
07:39	<robert_>	YAY
07:39	<alastair_>	ChrisGordon: I can get it to show up, just not run
07:39	<robert_>	perfect
07:39	<bur[n]er>	Lunz: double-click it in "places ->	computer" ?
07:39	<rayb0t>	go make some tea and have a cookie :)
07:39	<frojnd>	mbt: thanx
07:39	<alastair_>	rayb0t: really? weird
07:39	<robert_>	hm
07:39	<rayb0t>	its just network lag
07:39	<Avariel>	ugh ! i installed vorbis tools, gstreamers, mplayer plugin for mozilla, and gnash flash player plugin...but youtube wont even play !! any biggie im missing ?
07:39	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: but its not uniformly bigger, so i have to selectively resize certain components
07:39	<tuntun>	frojnd: APTonCD
07:39	<alastair_>	i'm going to copy all the debs into the apt archive and use dist-upgrade, I htink
07:39	<mrj>	Avariel, gnash can't play youtube
07:39	<platinum123>	for some reason the upgrade hangs trying to kill mysqld ... if i kill it manually it keeps coming back!
07:39	<ramvi>	My live CD is extreemly slow. Unusable. Is there anything I can do? The harddrive is working the living hell out of it self without me doing anything
07:39	<XsteelWolf>	<super><button1>	what's button 1
07:39	<IcemanV9>	virtualbox is very good compared to qemu+kqemu for years
07:39	<alastair_>	XsteelWolf: on the mouse?
07:39	<ChrisGordon>	alastair: when i run mine it says "unable to mount volume" and collapses
07:39	<Avariel>	right im just installing a bunch of media related things
07:39	<bur[n]er>	ramvi: buy more ram :)  or use the alternate cd to install
07:39	<rayb0t>	burninating the countrysideee
07:40	<mrj>	ChrisGordon, your menu.lst is probably pointing to the wrong harddrives
07:40	<xTheGoat121x>	ramvi, you might best off installing it
07:40	<alastair_>	ChrisGordon: you using apt-cerom?
07:40	<Name141>	Is it possible to shut off, then restart the NIC with a terminal command (such as something you can put in crontabs) ?
07:40	<inigomontoya>	can anyone help me with making a program start before all others?
07:40	<bur[n]er>	IcemanV9: they're apples & oranges... virtualbox is virtualization... qemu is not
07:40	<Avariel>	i must be missing something but i dont know what it is
07:40	<josenj76>	There are alot of packages that are "not installable" in 7.10  I can't install tcl8.4 for example.  How can I fix this?
07:40	<alastair_>	ChrisGordon: apt-cdrom
07:40	<ChrisGordon>	alastair: nein
07:40]  * xTheGoat121x *sings* ...and the Trogdor comes in the niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
07:40	<trogdor>	rayb0t: actually looking for  some ubuntu fan ware, perhaps a t shirt or such ^^
07:40	<bur[n]er>	josenj76: dist-upgrade
07:40	<XsteelWolf>	alastair_, left click?
07:40	<ramvi>	xTheGoat121x: Im not able to in that speed
07:40	<alastair_>	XsteelWolf: yeah, probably
07:40	<bur[n]er>	trogdor: ubuntu.com has a store :)
07:40	<rayb0t>	trogdor: hehehe ubuntu.com has some sweet merch
07:40	<Avariel>	what crucial plugins are there ?
07:40	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, But you shouldn't have to resize anything, I guess I just can't see how there would be a problem unless you are doing things like ( though this is an exaggeration ) using tabs to center text rather than setting it to be centered
07:40	<Lunz>	bur[n]er,Couldn't change the permissions because it is on a read-only disk
07:41	<trogdor>	XTheGoat121x: 2am here yeah night... did I leave my webcam on again!?
07:41	<Avariel>	or to play flv files
07:41	<bur[n]er>	Lunz: this is hte latest version?  latest version has ntfs write support
07:41	<BrendanJ>	Name141, try something like "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
07:41	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: i wanted certain things to all fit on one page
07:41	<Name141>	Someone claimed: sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up , and sudo /sbin/ifconfig eth0 down
07:41	<bur[n]er>	Avariel: .flvs will play with vlc
07:41	<xTheGoat121x>	trogdor, .... nah, it's 2:41 here... so I'm just assuming everyone's in my TZ
07:41	<Lunz>	bur[n]er,i am using gutsy
07:41	<mbt>	Anyone running Gutsy AMD64 having showstopper issues with OpenOffice.org?  I am experiencing very frequent and hard crashes when I do just about anything in it.
07:41	<Avariel>	bur[n]er: vlc, cool ill get that
07:41	<bur[n]er>	Lunz: crazy, writing to usb drives works here very very well :)
07:42	<josenj76>	burner, this is a clean install of 7.10.  I have 0 upgraded, 0 newly install, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded when I ran "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
07:42	<chowmeined>	Avariel: mplayer is also excellent
07:42	<Name141>	BrendanJ: actually I need it to disconnect from the router, not restart.
07:42	<meta-paonia>	trogdor there is a link on the ubuntu.com website which was updated today - they have "limited edition merchandice"
07:42	<BrendanJ>	Name141, that would work. I don't know if it physically turns off the NIC or not, but it certainly disables/reenables the interface
07:42	<Avariel>	yep got that one
07:42	<Jordan_U_>	chowmeined, Ah, I see, then document formats aren't really made for that. The same will happen with different versions of Word
07:42	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: ok
07:42	<Lunz>	bur[n]er,but how i cant enable it but it just works fine on 7.04
07:42	<trogdor>	meta-paonia: ah I see thx
07:42	<BrendanJ>	Name141, i.e. it would disconnect / reconnect to the router
07:43	<Name141>	BrendanJ: that's what I need, my ISP has a "fair access policy" to where I can only use a daily allowed limit of bandwidth, and hell if I want to keep using 'idle' hours/mins that add to it.
07:43	<Haruno>	anybody german here, who could help me translating to mrj?
07:43	<scguy318>	Haruno, there is a German channel
07:43	<scguy318>	!de | Haruno
07:43	<Name141>	BrendanJ: so after the "FAP-Free window" (5 AM) I need it to shut it off, unless I'm awake of course.
07:43	<alastair_>	hey
07:43	<josenj76>	bur[n]er, this is a clean install of 7.10.  I have 0 upgraded, 0 newly install, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded when I ran "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
07:43	<Avariel>	it keeps saying "sorry the contents of blabla cannot be displayed" for my external hard drive on ntfs...but i already downloaded ntfs-config package
07:43	<alastair_>	xmms no longer supported :(
07:43	<platinum123>	after "sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop" mysql still is running :( i don't need it to run, but it seems the upgrade will not proceed until it dies. any idea ho to keep it from relaunching?
07:43	<Avariel>	or maybe its not automatic and i have to eject and mount
07:43	<xTheGoat121x>	What?  XMMS is no longer supported?!?!
07:44	<BrendanJ>	Name141, what kind of ISP charges you for bandwidth when it's sitting idle? That's weak.
07:44	<bluebanana>	hi, I got "Error during update". pls see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41161/
07:44	<bluebanana>	what must i do?
07:44	<trogdor>	meta-paonia: what is with the monkey groping your chest on that shirt?
07:44	<Name141>	BrendanJ: It's sat
07:44	<Lunz>	scguy318,but how i cant enable write enable my usb drive? it just works fine on 7.04
07:44	<mmmiiikkkeee>	since i have had gutsy installed if I have "nvidia" as my device in xorg.config then when i go to log out I don't have an option for "shutdown" but if i use "nv" all is well.  any ideas(note this is in kde)?
07:44	<Name141>	BrendanJ: You have a 200 MB "rolling" limit per 24 hours.   or some strange crazy crap.
07:44	<jacquesmerde>	holy crap, ubuntu seems to be the most user-friendly distro there is, yet its the first time i havent been able to work out how to set up the partitions!
07:44	<riotkittie>	xTheGoat121x: it hasnt been supported for some time. audacious is an excellent replacement.
07:45]  * riotkittie laughs  
07:45	<Name141>	BrendanJ: besides 2-5 AM is unlimited.
07:45	<mrj>	I'm probably heading to bed soon
07:45	<josenj76>	There are alot of packages that are "not installable" in 7.10  I can't install tcl8.4 for example.  How can I fix this?  This is a clean install of 7.10
07:45	<Haruno>	mrj: it says s th like:" the graphics-server was rebooted 6 times in the last 90 seconds. probably something ent bad. before the next try on "anzeige :0", therell be a break of 2 minutes"
07:45	<scguy318>	Lunz: it should be just plugin and r/w, or am I missing something?
07:45	<Name141>	BrendanJ:  I need to just move to town.
07:45	<riotkittie>	jacquesmerde: using the guided on the live CD?
07:45	<Name141>	BrendanJ:  where there is DSL and cable.
07:45	<xTheGoat121x>	riotkittie, well the things you learn.  I did not know that XMMS was no longer supported.
07:45	<mrj>	Haruno, Gnome correct?
07:45	<jacquesmerde>	riotkittie: nah, manual. i'm dual-booting
07:45	<alastair_>	josenj76: have you done 'apt-get update'
07:45	<alastair_>	?
07:45	<Lunz>	scguy318,but it doesnt,doest it have anything to do with security?
07:45	<IcemanV9>	Name141: ah. cron can do the job between 2-5 am while you're sleeping. :)
07:45	<Haruno>	mrj: no doubt ^^
07:45	<josenj76>	alastair_, yes I have, several times
07:46	<jacquesmerde>	riotkittie: oh, i think i got it. what is the recommended file system for root? ext2? ext3?
07:46	<alastair_>	josenj76: what's the exact error?
07:46	<Name141>	IcemanV9: yeah, you know of a good download manager that would be something like Freedownloadmanager or GetRight?
07:46	<scguy318>	Lunz: not sure, you could try manually mounting
07:46	<riotkittie>	jacquesmerde: ext3 i believe
07:46	<scguy318>	jacquesmerde: ext3
07:46	<Name141>	IcemanV9: So that it would schedual , without me having to use wget.
07:46	<alastair_>	josenj76: "<package>	is unavailable but is referenced by another package" ?
07:46	<earlmred>	bah repositories are sloooow
07:46	<riotkittie>	but im not positive because i always go the manual route
07:46	<n0tworkn>	anyone know of any issues with the p5l-mx that would stop the install from completing?
07:46	<Lunz>	scguy318,command?
07:47	<riotkittie>	i wish people would stop complaining about the repos speeds tonight :P what do ya expect?
07:47	<Melancholy>	Heeeey! I have lil problems with my multimedia keys. dmesg / xer doesnt even return anything when i hit em. Help please :)
07:47	<n0tworkn>	motherboard
07:47	<n0tworkn>	sorry :)
07:47	<josenj76>	alastair_, the error reads "xchat: Depends: tcl8.4 (>= 8.4.5) but it is not installable .  E: Broken packages"
07:47	<mrj>	Haruno, I would probably just install KDE desktop in the meantime if you're not good with cli
07:47	<IcemanV9>	Name141: i believe there is bittorrent download manager (don't remember the actual name)
07:47	<alastair_>	josenj76: what does it say if you try and install tcl8.4
07:47	<scguy318>	Lunz: sudo ntfs-3g /dev/theusbdev /a/mnt/point/of/your/choosing
07:47	<Jordan_U_>	josenj76, Did you just upgrade recently?
07:47	<jacquesmerde>	in the "create partition" dialogue it looks like it wants you to chose the mount point, but at the same time it wont let you. seems you have to create it, set everything EXCEPT the mountpoint, then EDIT the partition, and set JUST the mountpoint
07:48	<Name141>	IcemanV9: ehh, I need FTP/HTTP viewer, and one that remembers the passes, and stuff.
07:48	<Avariel>	jesus i cant even play an mp3 file, im downloading vlc see if that does it
07:48	<scguy318>	Avariel: VLC does do it
07:48	<Jordan_U_>	Avariel, You should be able to just double click it
07:48	<scguy318>	Avariel: installing the restricted plugins shouldn't be seriously difficult tho
07:48	<Name141>	IcemanV9: or maybe I can try wine ?
07:48	<IcemanV9>	Name141: torrentflux is what i was looking for.
07:48	<riotkittie>	gstreamer plugins <3
07:48	<Avariel>	yeah its just im not too sure which ones they are
07:48	<Avariel>	gstreamer, mplayer, vlc
07:48	<Avariel>	i got those
07:48	<Name141>	IcemanV9: that doesn't just do torrents ?
07:48	<Jordan_U_>	Avariel, Just double click it, they will be installed automatically
07:49	<riotkittie>	ugly ugly-multiverse, bad.
07:49	<Lunz>	scguy318,but my usb is fat32
07:49	<scguy318>	Lunz: ah, in that case, you would do
07:49	<ChrisGordon>	ok, this is annoying, i made a disk for gutsy and it wont read on feisty
07:49	<Avariel>	on feisty ? i just seem to get an error message
07:49	<scguy318>	Lunz: sudo mount -t vfat /dev/usbdev /a/mnt/point/here, fill it in
07:49	<Jordan_U_>	Avariel, Or install all codecs by installing the "ubuntu-restricted-extras" package
07:49	<josenj76>	alastair_ then I try to install tcl8.4 and I get: "Package tcl8.4 is not available, but is referred to by another package.  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only availble from another source.  E: Package tcl8.4 has no installation candidate"
07:49	<Lunz>	scguy318,my mount point is /media/lunz
07:49	<max_>	hi, i installed gutsy on my pc but it takes a lot of time to load webpages, signin in pidgin and so on
07:49	<alastair_>	josenj76: right.  that's a packaging error in xchat, then
07:49	<scguy318>	Lunz: what is your USB device name?
07:49	<Avariel>	ubuntu-restricted-extras ? that a codec pack ?
07:49	<max_>	while downloadin from apt is ok
07:50	<alastair_>	josenj76: I think the best you can do is file a bug for it
07:50	<ChrisGordon>	max, is memory an issue?
07:50	<max_>	can someone help me?
07:50	<alastair_>	josenj76: or, you might be able to apt-get install --force
07:50	<scguy318>	Avariel: it might be cuz repos are slammed?
07:50	<Jordan_U_>	Avariel, It also installs Flash and Java
07:50	<Jordan_U_>	josenj76, Did you just upgrade recently?
07:50	<MrBister>	this is hilarious... I've been trying to install on two PCs now and it's not working on anyone of them... any ideas?
07:50	<Lunz>	scguy318,flash disk
07:50	<IcemanV9>	Name141: i did not get a chance to play with it; i believe it can get something to download besides torrents
07:50	<alastair_>	josenj76: I think TCL is only needed for plugins
07:50	<alastair_>	josenj76: if you have no tcl plugins then it will be fine

07:50	<riotkittie>	MrBister: if you could elaborate on "not working", that'd be swell
07:50	<IcemanV9>	Name141: you can control it from any web browser as well ...

07:51	<Avariel>	man vlc is still downloading ! the servers are dying
07:51	<Jordan_U_>	josenj76, Did you just upgrade recently?
07:51	<ChrisGordon>	Max, Loading times vary on the processing speed of your computer, how much ram do you have on the machine
07:51	<scguy318>	Lunz: can you pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l?
07:51	<nmersi>	Does anyone know if Canonical is going to put vmware-server packages in a repository for gutsy like they did for feisty?
07:51	<josenj76>	I'm also getting that for "gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad".  I tried the ubuntu-restricted-extras package
07:51	<AMDfanboy>	hi, my fresh install is hanging on "scanning the mirrors".  i restarted and it happened again?  if i wait will it eventually go through or should i just try tomorrow?
07:51	<max_>	512mb
07:51	<Name141>	Also , one other thing, does the new 7.10 read/write NTFS ?
07:51	<max_>	but with feisty it was ok
07:51	<robert_>	has anyone successfully compiled dgen?
07:51	<riotkittie>	Name141: yes
07:51	<Avariel>	josenj76: how was the ubuntu-restricted-extras ?
07:51	<IcemanV9>	Name141: anyway, just trying to give you an idea of a way to do it during 2-5am automatically
07:51	<josenj76>	Jordan_U_, no this is a fresh install
07:51	<dga>	AMDfanboy: just wait for it
07:51	<AMDfanboy>	aha!  i waited 20 minutes and it just went through!
07:51	<alastair_>	AMDfanboy: seems to be a problem currently.  too many people wanting to update
07:52	<murlidhar>	josenj76: just sudo apt-get install xchat
07:52	<Name141>	riotkittie: no fancy jancy hokey pokey needed anymore ?
07:52	<Jordan_U_>	josenj76, Have you tried "sudo apt-get -f install" ?
07:52	<riotkittie>	Name141: nope
07:52	<Name141>	OK
07:52	<nmersi>	Ubuntu mirrors are very stressed at the moment because of the new 7.10

07:52	<Haruno>	mrj: stupid question: how do i install kde?
07:52	<mmmiiikkkeee>	siif I have "nvidia" as my device in xorg.config then when i go to log out I don't have an option for "shutdown" but if i use "nv" all is well.  any ideas(note this is in kde)?
07:52	<josenj76>	Avariel, it asked me to remove some packages so I did after that it says that it's installed fine
07:52	<dystopianray>	has that bug been fixed where network-manager doesn't work after hibernate?
07:52	<max_>	chrisGordon, 512mb but with feisty there wasn't problem
07:52	<scguy318>	Haruno: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop, or a different metapackage if you want something less than the entire Kubuntu
07:53	<Muhammad>	I got a problem while istalling freespire can anyone help me please :(
07:53	<ChrisGordon>	max, ok, I am currently running a laptop with 256 ram while running fiesty, and I am slow, gutsy has more features and thier new fusion window software so it requires faster speeds that are in today's computers, so while 512 was enough for fiesty, gutsy may need more
07:53	<Avariel>	josenj76: aight ill check it out

07:53	<aunes2>	hey guys. just installed gutsy. I have dual monitors set up and currently, they're being displayed as one monitor. Screen 1's resolution is 2560x1024 and screen 2 is 1280x1024... I don't know where the 2560 came from. Its supposed to be two monitors as 1280x1024. Any thoughts?
07:53	<Haruno>	thx
07:53	<Jordan_U_>	mmmiiikkkeee, Do you see the screen flash a few times before X starts when you have "nvidia" set?

07:56	<mrj>	Haruno, er..yeah, it needs a repository to download it from
07:56	<aunes2>	any ideas what might cause dual displays be be shown as one big monitor (resolution is 2560x1024 instead of 1280x1024x2)? I have Xinerama installed. Do I need to install twinview? Ask me if I need to give more info
07:56	<Avariel>	argh i the glitch on my monitor display is pissing me off..its just this flashy glitchy thing at the bottom left

07:56	<scguy318>	Lunz: is your USB device 1 GB in capacity? looks like your partition table is fubared...
07:57	<riotkittie>	aunes2: check out your xorg.conf ... you may need to tweak the resolution there. ]backup first[
07:57	<n0tworkn>	aunes: which function key?
07:57	<Muhammad>	I isntalled Ubuntu after installing freespire but Ubuntu didn't let me boot to freespire can anyone help me
07:57	<Jordan_U_>	riotkittie, Doesn't mean you can't still use them :)
07:57	<volantares>	i'm now trying to install 7.10, and it's reached "configuring apt" (82%), and now it's just sitting here.. no apparently HD reading, nothing apparently happening... has it crashed or something?
07:57	<scguy318>	Lunz: you should run dat recovery apps on the USB device, the file system on it appears to be seriously corrupt
07:57	<Avariel>	volantares: mirror searching ?
07:57	<Broma>	no that isnt a crash colantares
07:57	<volantares>	Avariel: it says scanning the mirror
07:57	<Broma>	mine stalled for quite a while
07:57	<Avariel>	volantares: yep
07:57	<mbt>	volantares: The servers seem to be under load
07:57	<ChrisGordon>	Guhh, ubuntu can recognize most players (ipods, iriver, sandisk) but can only put on them what ubuntu supports, which does not include mp4s
07:57	<Jordan_U_>	Muhammad, You need to add it to your /boot/grub/menu.lst
07:58	<aunes2>	n0tworkn: it says during the load screen. I want to say its f6
07:58	<riotkittie>	volantares: the mirrors are being slaughtered. sit tight.
07:58	<noxs>	hi al
07:58	<mbt>	volantares: It may take a little bit for the server to answer.
07:58	<amonkey>	whats the new window manager called? i don't have any borders and apparently it's not called emerald any more.
07:58	<Avariel>	volantares: you can wait it out, or unplug your internet cable
07:58	<Avariel>	volantares: that worked for me
07:58	<volantares>	hmm..
07:58	<Jordan_U_>	Muhammad, Just look at the settings for Ubuntu and change the partition
07:58	<aunes2>	riotkittie: there is nothing in my xorg.conf regarding 2560 resolution
07:58	<volantares>	yes. that may be the option to take
07:58	<MrBister>	Is 7.10 incompatible with HP PCs? Have to ask since I've tried on FOUR machines now...
07:58	<riotkittie>	aunes2: in that case, no clue. D:
07:58	<Avariel>	volantares: i unplugged the internet and plugged it right back in and it worked
07:58	<aunes2>	riotkittie: how can I recreate it from scratch?
07:59	<MrBister>	anyone who has installed on a HP pc?
07:59	<Muhammad>	Jordan_U: great  how can I do that   can you explain please  as I'm a new user to Linux

07:59	<Broma>	it stalls its normal
07:59	<slaytanic>	MrBister: I did, on my notebook.
07:59	<volantares>	ok.. thanks
07:59	<riotkittie>	aunes2: i'm not sure that you want to do that [if you do, back it up first]... in a term -->	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
07:59	<scguy318>	Lunz: I suggest testdisk, Photorec for that purpose, lemme link you up
07:59	<Jordan_U_>	Muhammad, "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
07:59	<MrBister>	slatinc>	nice, the ones I've tried are desktops.
07:59	<Lunz>	scguy318,ok

08:00	<aunes2>	riotkittie: well if I backup, what's the worst, eh?
08:00	<antler>	how do i determine a partition's UUID?
08:00	<scguy318>	Lunz: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery the section "Data Recovery from damaged filesystem or drive" is probably what you are looking for
08:00	<riotkittie>	aunes2: nothing, really
08:00	<slaytanic>	MrBister: And the livecd won't even come up? What problem are you having?
08:00	<boubbin>	!lamp
08:00	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

08:05	<riotkittie>	Muhammad: you're going to need to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst and add an entry for Freespire
08:05	<scguy318>	riotkittie: he has the 9X/2K/XP ones, its was all-in-one or w/e

08:05	<AMDfanboy>	hey, i
08:05	<Muhammad>	how can I add freespire ?
08:06	<riotkittie>	Broma: yea. i'd ignore the message. unless something crazy starts happening, its probably no big deal
08:06	<Lunz>	riotkittie,i did install the driver and setting exactly the same from 7.04..but it doesnt work on gutsy..
08:06	<ace1>	hi everyone
08:06	<scguy318>	hallo
08:06	<Broma>	well i don't get the cube desktop feature and it doesn't appear anything realyl changes after running it
08:06	<wolfmanz>	anyone having issues with firefox displaying web pages properly?
08:06	<riotkittie>	Lunz: :(
08:06	<lewis1711>	how do I get permission to copy and paste files?
08:06	<Lunz>	riotkittie,it cant detect the wireless signal but couldnt connect..
08:06	<lewis1711>	and delete them and move them and all that
08:07	<ace1>	i've been screwing around with kismet, just upgraded to 7.10 and it's dropping out after 2-3mins.. works fine then goes dead, can't get a power reading or anything. i've been checking the forums and such and wanted to try removing wpa_supplicant, does anyone know how to go about doing that?
08:07	<AMDfanboy>	hey, i'm looking at the software sources in synaptic.  i see these two under 3rd party......  "partner"  and "partner (source code)".  i don't recognize these?  what are they?  thanks!
08:07	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, in your own user directory, you should already have those permissions. The system owns the root area, though.
08:07	<riotkittie>	Broma: have you enabled Cube? IIRC, Gutsy defaults to Desktop wall and you need to install compizconfig-settings-manager to disable that, and enable cube [assuming you are using 7.10]
08:07	<Lunz>	scguy318,it cant detect the wireless signal but couldnt connect..
08:07	<tritium>	riotkittie++
08:07	<lewis1711>	Madpilot, the root area being anything above my home directory?
08:08	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, basically, yes
08:08	<Broma>	let me try that ( I am using 7.10)
08:08	<eikke>	is it "normal" there are no module/.ko files in my generated initrd? ->	causes my lvm2 system not to boot, I think
08:08	<Lunz>	riotkittie,it just works fine with 7.04 and should be working on gutsy..
08:08	<eikke>	(ie since update to 7.10)
08:08	<lewis1711>	Madpilot, how do I then give myself permission to copy paste all files?
08:08	<scguy318>	Lunz: can you check what lsmod | grep ndiswrapper has?
08:08	<lewis1711>	and also it says I don't have permission to run .deb installation files
08:09	<Lunz>	scguy318,hold on
08:09	<scguy318>	Avariel: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AMD64/FirefoxAndPlugins
08:09	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, generally, you don't. for deb files, leave them on your desktop then just double-click them
08:09	<Ex-Cyber>	I just upgraded from Feisty to Gutsy via the DVD, and now Update Manager wants to do a "partial upgrade"; is this normal/safe, and how can I find details on what is causing it?
08:09	<scguy318>	Avariel: the portion about nspluginwrapper is of interest, and you should have used good ol' x86 :)
08:09	<Muhammad>	how can I add free spire to menu.lst in Ubuntu to make it boot again I really need help if anyone know this :(
08:09	<lewis1711>	Madpilot, I do and it says I don't have permission

08:11	<riotkittie>	Lunz: i'm not sure if this is relevant but i have an rt2500usb. i blacklisted that, and then blacklisted the newer driver [rt2x00...]  as well. i'm not sure that i /had/ to, but i'm assuming that if i'd been able to connect without doing it, i'd not have bothered.

08:12	<ace1>	fanboy, if you have trouble with anything on those lists should be easy enough to uncheck em an remove em :o)

08:37	<volk>	moDumass, you could try to reinstall everything... the most common cause of missing window decorations is missing argb visuals option, but since you have that i don't know what might be cousing your problems

08:39	<volk>	jotil, runlevels are just fast way to stop a lot of services and start them again when you need them, you don't usually need to switch runlevels... sure switching is advertised in different tutorials where you for example install nvidia drivers, but I just use "killall gdm" and then restart it when im done..:D

08:43	<nesoi>	I had the 2 weeks ago broken beta2 and update manager didn't say I needed anything even though the release is out. So, does anyone know how I can tell if I have the release version. I think it should at least be some packages I can check in synoptics
08:43	<XsteelWolf>	What's a good download manager for rapidshare
08:43	<platinum123>	should i be doing "sudo aptitude upgrade" or just using upgrade manager... does it matter?

Also although the display's native resolution is 1280x720, setting it to output this resolution results in the edges being cut off, lowering the resolution still has the edges c
08:43	<jscinoz_>	ut off, just with everything larger.
08:43	<scguy318>	lewis1711: for the mount option for the partition in question, you may have to edit the fstab entry for it so that all files are 777
08:44	<scguy318>	lewis1711: perhaps make it owned by you too with another flag
08:44	<jotil>	volk: i am trying to install nVidia graphics driver. there seems to be an issue. xorg starting on recovery mode. so figuring that out. but i needed my eth0 to connect the internet. that's why i asked. i was thinking about adding networking capabilities to the recovery mode because i like being lazy. but no big deal. i can type two lines of commands.
08:44	<lewis1711>	scguy318, I have no idea what that means.
08:44	<lewis1711>	I can copy from the windows hard drive to the linux one if that helps, but not vice versa
08:44	<lewis1711>	or at least I could
08:44	<lewis1711>	I dunno
08:44	<scguy318>	lewis1711: if you try to do it as root, does it succeed?
08:44	<lewis1711>	maybe I'll just burn it to CD:p
08:45	<vince>	uhhh... in VGA mode.. how do i force it to something over 8x6 =-P
08:45	<lewis1711>	scguy318, I only know how to sign in as sudo on command line, and that does not help

08:45	<smmagic>	Unmount is the same thing as eject right?

08:45	<lewis1711>	haha, it's all good

08:46	<ubotu>	envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!

08:48	<nesoi>	okay, an old version of eclipse. thanks bqmassey

08:48	<astro76>	aboyzz, well it should be, but considering it was released today, there are usually some bugs shaken out in the first month

08:49	<scguy318>	bqmassey: where do you want the NTFS partition to mount?
08:49	<cwill1>	lewis1711: i _think_ there's a chkdsk that you can run under linux, but I'm not dead sure, and if I recall recorrectly, it's not compatible with vista if you're running that

08:49	<scguy318>	panosru: the servers are overloaded
08:49	<jotil>	volk: you surely can use it to clean the restricted modules. the restricted modules are always causing trouble. everytime you upgrade distro, the nVidia binary breaks and then you have to go the same process over and over again.
08:49	<lavender_dream>	Can anyone quickly check that when you go to System ==>>	Software Sources, under the Ubuntu Software tab, you see TWO listings of the same "CD-rom with Ubuntu 7.10" with the bottom one checked? Is this normal? Can someone explain what this might be about?
08:49	<dot_>	hello! I updated to gutsy, but it can't find my usb harddrive and my msn fonts sucks
08:49	<cwill1>	lewis1711: k, well, safest answer is to reboot into windows like I said, but you might be able to find another option if ithappens again

09:05	<RivaeAerya>	Hello - I'm using Kubuntu right now and i plan on (maybe) switching back to Ubuntu because Ubuntu has got better support than Kubuntu, in features, software, and hardware. So, i deleted .gnome2 and .gnome and .gconf and .gconfd but now i can't run GNOME anymore. And, the preferences menu is loaded with all kinds of junk. So can anyone help me with all of this?
09:05	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: i am thinking i should try writing a tutorial for myself like volk suggested. that will help me and many others perhaps.
09:05	<bdgraue>	how can i get the information, which chipset my webcam have?
09:05	<cwill1>	RivaeAerya: ya, if you deleted all those, gnome is gonna be in trouble
09:06	<RivaeAerya>	cwill1: i did that because i wanted to reset all the GNOME configs
09:06	<cwill1>	RivaeAerya: try making a new user, see if it works more normally under that
09:06	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: because i just did what you are asking (installed and got GeForce 6200 to work) and i completely forgot how i did it

09:09	<lokh>	hi, I'm trying to install the 7.10 on an old compaq laptop, and the install is "looping" during filesystem detection. Did anybody had this problem? (the install was working with 7.04)
09:09	<RivaeAerya>	cwill1: how do i reset all the GNOME configuration the proper way, then?
09:09	<cwill1>	panosru: 6 :p
09:09	<platinum123>	will do
09:09	<panosru>	cwill1 which country?
09:10	<cyrano>	hi. this is my problem:
09:10	<cyrano>	I'm experiencing frequent crashes in openoffice 2.3 My spreadsheets crash a lot, and the writer is unusable...
09:10	<cyrano>	Uninstalling openoffice.org-gtk and openoffice.org-gnome packages solved the problem for me... but it's only a temporary fix cause it makes the program so extremly ugly windows 98 style...
09:10	<cyrano>	Has anyone elsed experienced this problem?
09:10	<cyrano>	This is my output when i start oo wirter in terminal: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41167/
09:10	<nesoi>	is apache configured by default in 7.10, or do you have to install and/or configure it?
09:10	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: i am trying to figure out how to help you
09:10	<cwill1>	RivaeAerya: not sure, I just wouldn't expect deleting them all would be it, unless its not working because you missed some or something
09:11	<dot_>	can someone help me getting my gutsy to work right, it won't mount my UBS-harddrive
09:11	<RivaeAerya>	cwill1: well, i think it's because i missed some, i think. Because, GNOME creates it's configs itself, for example at first startup
09:11	<Geoffrey2>	ok, the last message I see is PCI: MSI quirk detected. MSI deactivated.
09:11	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: I know and I thank you for that, just trying to get more people to think about that
09:11	<dot_>	can someone help me getting my gutsy to work right, it won't mount my UBS-harddrive
09:11	<cwill1>	dot_: what does it say when you mount it?
09:12	<WGGMk>	can anyone help me in setting up DHCP
09:12	<dot_>	cwill1: it says " Unable to mount the volume 'HD-HBU2'
09:12	<inspired>	gah, fonts in firefox look like crap after upgrading to gutsy. how could this have been done on purpose? any way to get back to the old fonts? this also goes for the gnome-console fonts
09:12	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: sudo gedit /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common
09:12	<silent>	bdgraue, have you done a synaptic search for webcam?
09:12	<cwill1>	inspired: can you be more specific?
09:12	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: then add this line: DISABLED_MODULES="nv"
09:12	<dot_>	cwill1: and the Details says  mount:/dev/sda1 alrady mounted or /media/Hd-HBU2_ busy
09:13	<cwill1>	inspired: might look at the fonts tab in appearance
09:13	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: ok, hold on
09:13	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: then reboot
09:13	<bdgraue>	silent: yes i did
09:13	<silent>	bdgraue, what showed up?
09:13	<bdgraue>	silent: ohh come on
09:13	<inspired>	cwill1, they lost their antialiasing, they are thinner. it looks like a completely different font, actually
09:13	<wubuntu>	hi, does anybody know how to make the special keys work on a thinkpad r31? don't wanna use tpb
09:13	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: and after rebooting what should I do?
09:13	<cwill1>	dot_: okay, open a terminal, and type mount, and copy what it says into a pastebin
09:13	<RivaeAerya>	cwill1: well, i think it's because i missed some, i think. Because, GNOME creates it's configs itself, for example at first startup
09:13	<jotil>	it should be fine after that
09:13	<cwill1>	inspired: is font smoothing turned on in appearances?
09:13	<inspired>	cwill1, this goes for the menus and dialogs in firefox as well as the inline font in websites
09:13	<jotil>	cross your fingers
09:13	<platinum123>	all commented out but the cdrom... trying to figure out how to answer "Accept this solution?" see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41170/
09:13	<inspired>	cwill1, yes
09:14	<jotil>	if it doesn't come back again
09:14	<panosru>	cwill1 i get the same error now but now i found why i get the error
09:14	<cwill1>	RivaeAerya: in which case, look for the ones you missed :p
09:14	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: I already have this in that file: DISABLED_MODULES="nv nvidia_new"

09:14	<nesoi>	how do I get that to work?
09:15	<cwill1>	inspired: are you using a different font in firefox by any chance?  I know they turned off antialiasing in the mono fonts, although there's a way to turn it back on iirc
09:15	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: I can't tell if it is... How should I check? running glxgears?
09:15	<panosru>	cwill1, maybe its a bug but if i change something to repos through Software Sources it adds some repos that don't work
09:15	<dot_>	cwill1: http://pastebin.org/5282
09:15	<cwill1>	panosru: if it adds web, then just delete it
09:15	<inspired>	cwill1, I haven't changed anything. just did a clean upgrade from feisty to gutsy. not using any special fonts
09:15	<cyrano>	so... noones interested in helping me out?
09:15	<cwill1>	panosru: there might be an amd64 bug, check launchpad.net
09:15	<Geoffrey2>	someone was trying to help me get Gutsy loaded, told me to retry the install with splash quiet removed....the last message I get before the system hangs is "PCI: MSI quirk detected. MSI deactivated."

09:21	<Perella>	thanks
09:21	<ademan>	hey guys, keeping the future in mind how big of a / partition do you think i need?
09:21	<Keef_>	aunes_: just set them up in nvidia-settings with the default Restricted Drivers
09:21	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: hehe. something funny happened. i rebooted and i get the exact error as you do.
09:21	<wubuntu>	does anybody know how to make the special keys work on a thinkpad r31 with hotkey-setup? don't wanna use tpb
09:21	<aunes_>	Keef_: there should be an option in there to write the changes to your xorg.conf
09:21	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: aw man.... lol
09:21	<themoebius>	I can't find the gtk theme manager. isn't it supposed to be in preferences?
09:21	<cwill1>	inspired: you might be seeing the newer font hinting, but the tinypic is _way_ less blurry (looking at the l's for instance)
09:21	<QuelTos>	ademan: I am fine with a 20GB HD
09:21	<aunes_>	Keef_:  I'd walk you through it, but my nivida-settings are broken
09:22	<ademan>	QuelTos: lol, well this is a laptop, that's about half of my total disk space right there
09:22	<ademan>	i was hoping someone would say 10GB lol
09:22	<jotil>	dude - chill for a bit because i'll really need to go now
09:22	<Keef_>	aunes_: yer I've saved them, it's just my X Server dies when I reboot the next time, lol
09:22	<dot_>	mount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /mnt busy
09:22	<QuelTos>	ademan: hehe
09:22	<jotil>	but when i'll be back, i'll fix my thing
09:22	<cwill1>	inspired: but, if that's what you're seeing, try changing the advanced settings in fonts, full hinting or none, see what you like
09:22	<dot_>	cwill1: dot@shining:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt -o uid=dot
09:22	<dot_>	mount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /mnt busy
09:22	<jotil>	i'll write down how i fixed it
09:22	<inspired>	cwill1, it's not blurry on my display. it's _antialised_
09:22	<jotil>	so you can ask me later?
09:22	<aunes_>	Keef_: save them to something that isn't xorg.conf and then run a diff after it crashes and comes back up
09:22	<jotil>	how about that?
09:22	<cwill1>	inspired: that's blurry :p
09:22	<aunes_>	that should tell you what's different which might yield some clues.
09:22	<QuelTos>	ademan: 10GB will do it as well.. but there's not much space to install apps and stuff then
09:23	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: sure, but how should I know when to look for you? lol
09:23	<cwill1>	inspired: vertical lines shouldn't be aliased unless you really need the kerning to be exactly the same (which is silly for html, as opposed to ps output)
09:23	<Keef_>	aunes_: ok thanks good idea
09:23	<Schmallon>	Just in case anyone is interested: I had firefox segfault on startup with 7.10. Reinstalling fixed it.
09:23	<ademan>	QuelTos: yeah that's what i was sorta afraid of, i spent all of today working on getting lvm working so that I could resize partitions as needed, but i never could get it working
09:23	<cwill1>	inspired: look at the settings I mentioned though, they should be there
09:23	<borgware>	Hi, can someone help me with ubuntu installation?
09:23	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: i should be around. but not before 4 or 5 hours from now.
09:23	<aunes_>	Keef_: think you could help me get my nvidia-settings working?
09:23	<inspired>	cwill1, I don't get it. this has been the default style in all my prior ubuntu installations. it used to be like that. why was it changed? I'll try the hinting
09:23	<wilson>	you can download the nvidia driver off the nvidia website, reboot, press ctrl-alt-f1, killall kdm or killall gdm, go sh [location/name of nvidia driver] , choose to compile the driver, choose to update the config file, reboot
09:23	<cwill1>	inspired: also, it might be that gutsy turned on subpixel, which may not be what you're used to
09:23	<wilson>	that's how you do it manually, i prefer it that way
09:24	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: ok, thanks anyway, I'll look for you later
09:24	<xerawx>	font smoothing is a very subjective thing.. i'm using OS X right now (eww, i know) and i can't stand its fugly blurry font smoothing.. of course apple zealots will swear up and down how it's vastly superior..
09:24	<QuelTos>	ademan: ext3 supports some kind of partition resizing as well.. but i think it can only extend a partition

09:24	<dot_>	cwill1: dot@shining:~$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt -o uid=dot
09:24	<Flannel>	QuelTos, ademan, it can only move he foot of the partition, not the head.

09:24	<enry>	thank you Ubuntu

09:26	<nightfreak>	how do i change my time from UTC to CEST?
09:26	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: no more dual booting
09:26	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: i have wipe enitre hda, so i thought now might be a good chance to tire vista instead of using windows 2003 server.
09:26	<borgware>	Can't boot ubuntu CD getting black screen after selecting run/install ubuntu....anyone?
09:26	<cwill1>	dot_: one sec actually, need to pee :p
09:27	<inspired>	cwill1, eheh, now the freaking font on every website is serif. I wan't to set my default font to NOTHING
09:27	<ademan>	borgware: i had a lot of trouble with the liveCD myself
09:27	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: you can run vista as a virtual machine too if you'd like
09:27	<QuelTos>	ademan: on my laptop i use about 30GB for my gentoo root, 5GB for my windows root, and 25GB for a data-partition read/writeable by win and linux
09:27	<a514>	Can i use a deb for etch http://gyachi.sf.net ?
09:27	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: you can have them all.. at the same time
09:27	<ademan>	borgware: did you get the "loading bar" for a while?
09:27	<borgware>	any solution?
09:27	<borgware>	nope
09:27	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: i am using virtual machines, but i like to run it natively. faster.
09:27	<borgware>	nothing
09:27	<kilopopo>	damn ubuntu is rocking
09:27	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	Guys: can someone else take a loot at this as well? I can't make Gutsy to work with my Nvidia GeForce 6200 with OpenGL... I've tried everything possible, restricted drivers, nvidia-glx-legacy, glx and glx-new and envy. Nothing works. This is my xorg.conf file: http://pastebin.ca/742130 and this is X error log: http://pastebin.ca/742137
09:27	<kilopopo>	now to try vmware
09:27	<wubuntu>	does anybody know how to make the special keys work on a thinkpad r31 with hotkey-setup? don't wanna use tpb
09:27	<enry>	ubuntu is great!!
09:27	<AronRaavHex>	when i run dosbox with the -fullscreen option it doesn't quite fill the width of the screen, what could be wrong?
09:27	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: what would you be using under windows?
09:27	<xerawx>	yellow_chicken: if you like faster then you probably won't like vista
09:28	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: i mean.. its not noticeably slower on my box as a vmachine
09:28	<ademan>	borgware: that sucks, i at least had it working well enough to get to the installer, i'm hoping it'll behave better once it's installed, but right now it really seems like gutsy is having some major hardware compatibility problems, never had any problems like this with feisty
09:28	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: nothing, just hyper terminal. to connnect to cisco router
09:28	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: i just rdesktop into it...
09:28	<Geoffrey2>	well, if I can ever get Gutsy to actually load, I'll probably love it too.....but that's just not happening right now
09:28	<a514>	How do i make the Compiz rotating Cube Transparent ? what option do i use?
09:28	<borgware>	Me too
09:28	<cwill1>	back
09:28	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: you can do that with linux... try minicom
09:28	<RhDfC>	malang
09:28	<borgware>	works on my single core CPU and agp card
09:28	<yellow_chicken>	xerawx: yes, but i might take the vista cert in the future. i have 2gb ram, about 1.7 ghz celeron
09:28	<dot_>	cwill1: it answered mount: /dev/sda1 already mounted or /mnt busy
09:28	<cwill1>	inspired: advanced, set the default to 'sans serif'
09:29	<ubotu>	Launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/
09:29	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: or telnet.. or putty-tel
09:29	<cwill1>	dot_: do you know what filesystem is on the device?
09:29	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: rdesktop is fast, but rdesktop can't go into ubuntu
09:29	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ipw3945 - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
09:29	<dot_>	cwill1: noup

09:29	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about toilet mouth - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
09:29	<inspired>	cwill1, had to do about:config to remove the default
09:29	<cwill1>	dot_: what was the pastebin again?
09:29	<cwill1>	inspired: :/
09:29	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: ok, will look into minicom. hope setting it up will be easy

09:30	<wubuntu>	does anybody know how to make the special keys work on a thinkpad r31 with hotkey-setup? don't wanna use tpb
09:30	<cwill1>	inspired: you didn't set the 'always use my fonts' option did you?
09:30	<cwill1>	thx
09:30	<xerawx>	anyone know if it's possible to somewhat painlessly run compiz and 3D stuff in wine yet?
09:30	<Geoffrey2>	early into the load process, I get an allocation error and everything hangs
09:30	<dot_>	cwill1: http://pastebin.org/5282
09:30	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: its similar settings (xon/xoff, stop bit, no parity etc)
09:30	<cwill1>	yes
09:30	<Hans-Martin>	after upgrading to 7.10, my system does not start up properly (udevd_event loops). any idea what could be wrong?
09:30	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: ok
09:30	<inspired>	cwill1, nah, I just set the default one in Contents
09:30	<Extravert>	good thing my upgrade didnt work
09:30	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: no i meant.. i remote desktop from my native ubuntu into the windows vmachine
09:30	<dot_>	cwill1: http://pastebin.org/5282
09:30	<QuelTos>	anyone else having trouble getting the xserver work after upgrade?
09:30	<dvtorless>	Is trackerd supposed to eat up ridiculous amounts of ram (600mb+) ?
09:30	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: yes, i know what you mean, i ve done it before, but not the other way around.
09:31	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: that way when i have to restart windows for whatever reason.. or if it decides to freeze up.. i can get out of it and continue being productive
09:31	<nomad111>	oh man street fighter 4
09:31	<nomad111>	lol
09:31	<cwill1>	inspired: ya, under advanced, you can set whether you want serif or sans serif used for proportional fonts
09:31	<cwill1>	anyways
09:31	<Hans-Martin>	QuelTos: yup, me - but that's probably a different problem
09:31	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	Guys: can someone else take a loot at this as well? I can't make Gutsy to work with my Nvidia GeForce 6200 with OpenGL... I've tried everything possible, restricted drivers, nvidia-glx-legacy, glx and glx-new and envy. Nothing works. This is my xorg.conf file: http://pastebin.ca/742130 and this is X error log: http://pastebin.ca/742137
09:31	<borgware>	maybe ubuntu team should do more testing next time
09:31	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: vmware's console, does not display x term and other apps correctly. and sometime very slow, cause of no-graphic-acceler.
09:31	<RhDfC>	malang
09:31	<chowmeined>	borgware: actually.. seeing as its a community effort
09:32	<dot_>	cwill1: http://pastebin.org/5282
09:32	<cwill1>	borgware: that's a somewhat amusing opinion
09:32	<chowmeined>	borgware: maybe YOU should do more testing next time
09:32	<QuelTos>	Hans-Martin: mhh.. i think my xserver is running.. but my monitor doesn't get a displayable signal
09:32	<lazsoy>	hi every body
09:32	<borgware>	I'm done with testing
09:32	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: yes its unfortunate
09:32	<cwill1>	dot_: yes, I've been looking at it the last couple minutes
09:32	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: at one point, i created a vfat and installed windows in it. so both dual boot (xp and ubuntu) can start the vmware images.
09:32	<Wikzo>	I just installed 7.10. How do I make Ctrl+Alt+Delete showing my System watching like in Windows? I did it on 7.04 in Metacity, but now the key shortcut is gone because of Compiz Fusion
09:32	<dot_>	thanks
09:32	<wilson>	i get nothing when i go to those links in konqueror ZaphodBeeblebrox
09:32	<borgware>	doesn't work got it?
09:32	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: you can actually install an xserver on windows
09:32	<wubuntu>	does anybody know how to make the special keys work on a thinkpad r31 with hotkey-setup? don't wanna use tpb
09:32	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	wilson: weird.... hold on please
09:33	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: believe it or not.. and then you can do remote X to have your X apps drawn natively in windows.. if you'd prefer to do it that way.. (or you could try VNC)
09:33	<smmagic>	Anyone know how to get ethernet working in VMware workstation?
09:33	<cwill1>	dot_: what does lsof|grep /dev/sda1 say?
09:33	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: yes, i ve seen it on wikipedia. but requires putty. but i feel that putty is not too legit. it's not a commercial product
09:33	<dot_>	cwill1: it said nothing
09:33	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: oh?
09:33	<dot_>	it "accepted it"
09:33	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: neither is openssh
09:34	<cwill1>	dot_: no, it didn't find anything :p
09:34	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: and there's no main site, or offical site for putty. the url for putty download looks like crap.
09:34	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: and openssh is tons better than ssh.com's commerical ssh software
09:34	<chowmeined>	yellow_chicken: putty is open source, and widely used
09:34	<Extravert>	fetching file 45 of 54 ... 5 hours later.... 10 hours later....
09:34	<smmagic>	NO one knows?
09:34	<dot_>	cwill1: what now?

09:34	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined: well openssh is default on the os (ubuntu) so many people are using it. but i might not be using the same putty version as everyone else, cause there's no legit website for putty

09:45	<webslave>	Hi@udo I upgraded last night, it looks like you get the choice to keep the patched kernel
09:46	<yellow_chicken>	chowmeined:  well, my choice will be vista-business edition or windows 2003 and then dual boot with ubuntu.
09:46	<cwill1>	Wikzo: check 'keyboard shortcuts' in preferences

09:51	<|box|>	goe burn the cd as an iso
09:51	<MrBister>	webslave>	maybe ubuntu don't like intel onboard gfx.
09:51	<dot_>	cwill1: but the 111.8 ain't usb
09:51	<cwill1>	dot_: okay, that's /dev/hdb1, which you could mount in a similar fashion

09:52	<wilson>	edit the file dot_  just press enter at the end of the last line then save it
09:52	<dot_>	cwill1: how?
09:52	<cwill1>	i.e., /dev/hdb1 /mnt, or make a folder in /media and mount it there
09:52	<zcat[1]>	perhaps there's no final newline at the end of /etc/fstab ? (the line you just added?)

09:54	<HymnToLife>	smmagic, what kind of connection do you have ?
09:54	<zcat[1]>	smmagic: install firestarter, run it, click the box that says 'share my intetrnet connection' or something similar..

09:55	<Keef_>	should I have a problem with dual monitors and a 8600GT?
09:55	<zcat[1]>	firestarter doesn't have to start.. it modifies system-wide firewall rules which should get loaded on boot.
09:55	<cwill1>	dot_: what type of drive is it?
09:55	<JimQode>	tim__b, install gnome-compiz-config, enable the `put` plugin.

09:55	<webslave>	Sorry cyrano, I am having problems with gutsy myself try rolling OO back to 2.3 (unchanged) by downloading the rpm or .deb file from open office directly there looks to me like there is a config file corruption of some sort - I just do not knwo enough about gutsy to give an informed answer, when all else fails with Linux removed and re-install

09:59	<tim__b>	JimQode, sorry, i didn't mention it: gutsy
10:00	<cyrano>	cwill1: no. just starting a clean fresh writer won't work. the window crshes after a fraction of a second
10:00	<atz8501>	!easysource
10:00	<cwill1>	Doitle: it happens when every user is running an upgrade at the same time :p

10:00	<wilson>	Geoffrey2, there's either some kind of incompatibility with the pc you're installing it on or the disc isn't right
10:01	<cyrano>	cwill1: I dont know. how do i find out?
10:01	<webslave>	@zNOOPy  ummm hey which one?
10:01	<JimQode>	tim__b, package name is "compizconfig-settings-manager" for gutsy
10:01	<dot_>	cwill1: I don't have the package called dmraid, should I install it?
10:01	<cwill1>	cyrano: synaptic package manager under system|admin
10:01	<wilson>	Geoffrey2, when i say the disc isn't right i mean, maybe it's not burned right, or maybe it's corrupt, or maybe there's a scratch on it
10:01	<cwill1>	dot_: no
10:01	<|box|>	Geoffrey2:  if you burn as an iso i always burn at a max of 4x
10:01	<tim__b>	thanks, JimQode
10:01	<dot_>	ok
10:01	<cwill1>	you shouldn't have any of those three installed, unless you're running a raid
10:01	<Robbster>	hey. I'm using pbuilder to build php4 under gutsy. I'm getting build dependency failures. anyone used pbuilder?

10:02	<dot_>	cwill1:  I got the package mdadm, should I uninstall it?
10:02	<Geoffrey2>	wilson: well, the MD5 sum matched, it appears to be a kernel bug...it just doesn't wanna play nice with the ATI SB600 chip on my motherboard
10:02	<webslave>	hmmm @cyrano  it just might be that you will have to upgrade your java runtime too login and sudo apt-get install java
10:02	<wilson>	if it's an incompatibility thing, you might want to try downloading the alternative install version of gutsy and see how you go with that. That version has no live-cd component, only a text installer
10:02	<cwill1>	dot_: uninstall those packages if you see them (cwillu disclaims any warrenty if somebody else setup a raid on your system, but it wouldn't have happened automatically)
10:03	<cypherdelic>	I cant start gnome-system-monitor as user, but sudo will work: Error is: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Glib::FileError' Aborted - Im with Ubuntu Gutsy, no compiz. Already reinstalled gnome-system-monitor. Please help.

10:07	<marx2k>	and I cant figure out the problem

10:11	<webslave>	cwill1 never done that before how?
10:11	<hislop>	there no min/max button on windows..what should i do?
10:11	<cwill1>	webslave: when you boot the livecd, hit f6, and change the kernel line

10:12	<wildintellect>	anyone know where the view tab of the deskbar-applet went or how to change the width so I can type in my bar again without opening a window
10:12	<dot_>	cwill1: this sure takes time
10:12	<cwill1>	webslave: can't easily install from it, but it's useful for recovery
10:12	<webslave>	ahhh yes ok cool thanks
10:12	<garu>	|box| lol...that was before...I got the same card as you have
10:12	<cwill1>	dot_: ya, you'd have been better off removing them all at the same time, but it has to do a bunch of work re: kernel modules, and if you have a slow machine, it'll take a while
10:12	<webslave>	done that before its a pain in the ........ but I can do it
10:12	<garu>	|box| do sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl, and then restart X
10:12	<|box|>	garu ive googled it and it seems quiet a pain to install

10:13	<|box|>	garu:  you only get 2d effects though ?
10:13	<garu>	|box| copy the command that I gave you to the terminal and youll have it working. If you have the ATI 200M I garantee it'll work rigjt after this
10:13	<inspired>	cwill1, http://img86.imageshack.us/my.php?image=skjermdumpfirefoxiw9.png VS http://img80.imageshack.us/my.php?image=skjermdumpoperayz3.png  ... remember to upscale them. which one is prettier? Opera looks like Firefox did in Feisty and that's what I think it should look like too. Firefox is completely messed when it comes to fonts
10:13	<cwill1>	cypherdelic: upgrade or fresh install?  also, make a new user, log in using that user, and try it
10:13	<plik>	g'day folks :)
10:13]  * cwill1 grins at inspired
10:13	<machaddock>	could someone please tell me where I can find the pidgin launcher in xubuntu (i'm guessing its the same place as in ubuntu so I'm asking here) thanks
10:13	<Myrtti>	!repeat | cypherdelic, the population of the channel hasn't changed that much...
10:13	<webslave>	ahhh if only life was just so simple lol I have an old sony VIAO GRT816s so that approach does not work blech lol I keep Knoppix on call for these occations

10:14	<cypherdelic>	cwill1: that will probably work i guess, but please tell me where to delte configs in my home folder to get that working for my user...
10:14	<LJHarb>	im on dapper server, and i have a multiple screen session. can i save it somehow, so i can recall it at will even after the machine restarts?
10:14	<|box|>	yea it trys then tells me  effects cant work
10:14	<cwill1>	although the hinting isn't quite right, might be the gamma on my machine though
10:14	<|box|>	ill copy paste this see what happens
10:14	<wildintellect>	machaddock, in network
10:14	<garu>	|box| once you do that, install ccsm from the add/remove applications or synaptic, and then, u'll be able to configure compiz fusion as u like
10:14	<cwill1>	cypherdelic: try it first
10:14	<martyvis>	LJHarb: not the running sessions
10:14	<cypherdelic>	ok
10:14	<garu>	|box| do that and let me know
10:14	<Murphy05>	hey could someone help me out here? i dl-ed the alternative cd to upgrade my feisty, everything went well on my laptop however on my desktop i get "tar: ./dists/stable/main/dist-upgrader/binary-all//gutsy.tar.gz: Cannot open: No such file or directory" when i type in terminal "./cdromupgrade"... the disc is mounted to /media/cdrom ...ubuntu forums recommend getting rid of spaces in the mount point but there are not spaces in my mount

10:15	<webslave>	anyway y'all its been fab meeting ya  if you wanna keep in touch my web site is http://www.incrediblesoftwaresolutions.com/blog
10:15	<martyvis>	LJHarb: screen doesn't survive reboots
10:15	<machaddock>	wildintellect --- thanks but I'm trying to make a launcher in the top menu and I can't find the original "program" see
10:16	<CroX>	I upgraded to Gutsy, found that none of my games no longer worked, installed new Nvidia drivers (from their site) and now I'm stuck with vesa. I can't get out of this.. Anyone care to help me?
10:16	<webslave>	please forgive the firefox css erors I am busy doing something with my pc at the mo...lol
10:16	<marx2k>	Ahhhh I am in NVidia hell!!!
10:16	<webslave>	cheerio
10:16	<wildintellect>	machaddock, it should be in /usr/bin like all other programs, let me check
10:16	<dot_>	cwill1: the Applying changes window says that mdadm is removed
10:16	<cwill1>	inspired: there was an article on reddit a while back about aliasing
10:16	<dot_>	but I can't close the window
10:16	<LJHarb>	martyvis: theres no way to save it somewhere? the contents must be stored as a file somewhere
10:16	<RhDfC>	hi
10:16	<cwill1>	or smoothing I mean
10:16	<CroX>	marx2k: Let's form a club..
10:16	<Slart>	CroX: can you pastebin the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and give us the url?
10:17	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about jre - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
10:17	<CroX>	Slart: Will do.
10:17	<ubotu>	To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
10:17	<wildintellect>	machaddock, you should be able to launch it with just pidgin
10:17	<cwill1>	inspired: http://img86.imageshack.us/my.php?image=skjermdumpfirefoxiw9.png by far
10:17	<ubotu>	It is spelt !guTSy :)

10:17	<marx2k>	this is terrible
10:17	<ubotu>	cypherdelic, the population of the channel hasn't changed that much...: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
10:17	<cwill1>	dot_: ?
10:17	<machaddock>	wildintellect i'll se if i can find it under usr bin tanks
10:17	<cypherdelic>	cwill1: other user can start gnome-system-monitor, what to do now??
10:17	<inspired>	cwill1, you really think so? that's not how it looked in Feisty on my setups. did it on yours?
10:17	<cwill1>	ubotu is a little slow today :)
10:17	<|box|>	E: Couldn't find package xserver-xgl
10:17	<Slart>	CroX: and while you're at it.. pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log too
10:17	<cwill1>	cypherdelic: start copying the gnome files from your user to the new user, one by one, until it breaks
10:18	<dot_>	cwill1: I forcequitted synaptic
10:18	<garu>	can someone help me out with wireless connectivity issues?it seems that everytime I try to install an app using synaptic or the add/remove apps, I lose my wireless connection, and it tries to connect again and never does unless I restart the computer!
10:18	<martyvis>	LJHarb: must it? i think it is all in memory - there may be a logging functions - but you wouldn't be able to read that in. though it would be nice patch if you could make it work. best thing you do is to run screen on a machine that never (or rarely goes down) and use that as your jumphost onto other machines
10:18	<dot_>	it was so slow
10:18	<cypherdelic>	cwill1: wich folder do you mean in special??

10:18	<wildintellect>	garu, does it happen if you use apt-get?
10:19	<marx2k>	Is EVERYONE having NVidia issues?
10:19	<cwill1>	inspired: I don't think firefox adjusts the font smoothing prefs without a restart though
10:19	<|box|>	yea just got 7 10 last night from demonoid  installed last night
10:19	<garu>	|box| what version of ubuntu are you on?
10:19	<CroX>	Slart: http://pastebin.com/d2c275bc3
10:19	<sunami>	hi can i install ubuntu using a thumbdrive?
10:19	<inspired>	cwill1, I turn that off in gnome, right?
10:19	<martyvis>	LJHarb:  C-a h       (hardcopy)    Write a hardcopy of the current window to the file "hardcopy.n".

10:19	<CroX>	Slart: Thanks for taking the time. :)
10:19	<cwill1>	dot_: k, does udevmonitor still show all that stuff?
10:20	<dot_>	cwill1: no i pressed ctrl + c

10:20	<machaddock>	wildintellect -- thanks I found it there. Now for a follow up question to make me remember the /usr/bin thing.. usr obviously stands for user but what does bin stand for?
10:20	<cwill1>	dot_: no, I mean if you run it again, and replug the drive
10:20	<garu>	wildintellect yep...I used apt-get install... (as root), but I guess it would still work with sudo aptitude install...I havent tried with the aptitude, but I guess it would be ok
10:20	<inspired>	cwill1, subpixel is off already
10:20	<garu>	|box| did u do updates?
10:20	<dot_>	cwill1: but after I force quitted synaptic and opened it again I wrote mdadm I don't have it installed
10:20	<marx2k>	You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server.

10:21	<Slart>	CroX: hmm.. what happens when you boot and start gnome? nothing special? you don't get the "setup video drivers for X"-dialog?
10:21	<jazz631>	how can i determine what drives are mounted where?
10:21	<cwill1>	dot_: run udevmonitor, replug the drive, and tell me if udevmonitor spits out the same junk it did last time
10:21	<humbolto>	does anybody know yet how to get nvidia-glx-new to work?
10:21	<martyvis>	LJHarb: if do a screenlog every time you launch a new window at least it will saved in a file - you can't load it back into the buffer afaik
=== benzss is now known as benzs_s
10:21	<Slart>	jazz631: run "mount" in a terminal
10:21	<CroX>	Slart: I get "you're running in low graphics mode". And I get that dialog, yes.
10:21	<wildintellect>	machaddock, I don't really know what it means other than thats the folder that programers put executables in
10:22	<jazz631>	thanks!
10:22	<CroX>	Slart: It's set to use vesa and if I try chaning it to nv it wont start

10:22	<pucko_>	Hello. After upgrading to gutsy I can't hear any sound any more. snd-hda-intel is loaded fine and "sound plays" but I simply can't hear anything. And nothing is muted in alsamixer. Anyone else have this problem?
10:22	<garu>	wildintellect yeah...i'v tried that, and nothing...it just keeps trying to connect and nothing...right now its the longest i'v been connected, but if I start browsing the internet or try to install a program,I'll be disconnected
10:22	<humbolto>	failsafeX freaks out on me when I am trying to use nvidia-glx-new. normal nvidia-glx is working. before my latest upgrade -new was working too!
10:22	<CroX>	Slart: So I tried vesa, logged in and tried enabling the restricted driver for my gfx card. Rebooted as suggested and boom, back to that "low graphics mode" warning.
10:22	<garu>	|box| try sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
10:22	<Slart>	CroX: mm.. same problem I had.. I had to manually go back to my old xorg.conf
10:22	<lostfaith>	could someone point me in the right direction to get my dell d820 laptop wireless working? I had hope by now that linux had moved on and would work from fresh install, but even ubuntu7.10 didnt, hence my irc name :(

10:24	<inspired>	cwill1, font.FreeType2.unhinted was true. let me try with false

10:27	<MaTrIx-X>	Anyone at all ? ISCSI Enterprise Target on Gutsy?
10:27	<Slart>	CroX: ok.. look at the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log  you can use gedit or less or whatever.. check at the top what configuration file it uses.. is it xorg.conf or xorg.conf.failsafe
10:27	<cwill1>	dot_: what's the word?
10:27	<Slart>	CroX: I don't know why that error pops up.. just go with the gnome settings

10:28	<garu>	|box| you must be on a different ATI CARD
10:28	<cwill1>	it _should_ say some stuff, it _shouldn't_ say add remove /block/dm-1
10:28	<dot_>	and then udvmonitor and then plug again?

10:29	<dot_>	cwill1: it addremoves the same /block/dm-1 (block)
10:29	<dot_>	do I now plug my USB
10:29	<Slart>	CroX: ok.. try this.. run this in a terminal "ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf*".. you should get a couple of files with dates at the end.. one of those will be your old xorg.conf.. try to find which one is your old file

10:35	<cwill1>	thx
10:35	<CroX>	Slart: It does.
10:35	<wildintellect>	garu, dmesg | tail gives you only the last part
10:36	<wildintellect>	yellow_chicken, think about changes your sources to a different mirrot
10:36	<yellow_chicken>	wildintellect: how to make change?
10:36	<Sevk>	 vbox in 7.10 ,any problem?
10:36	<Slart>	CroX: ok.. yesterday I had the very same problem you have now.. but all of a sudden my ubuntu started using the correct xorg.conf... I thought it was the dpkg-reconfigure line you ran before..
10:36	<garu>	wildintellect there is something I noticed though at the end, it says wlan0 address duplicated
10:36	<dot_>	cwill1: when I opened the /messages

10:37	<dot_>	The file /var/log/messages changed on disk. do you want to reload the file?
10:37	<MrEgg964>	wildintellect: okay, I found a 'us' setting which I changed to 'fr' - I suppose this should do the trick when I reboot.
10:37	<dot_>	what do I choose
10:37	<cwill1>	winkiller: hit check
10:37	<wildintellect>	yellow_chicken, you can either edit /etc/apt/sources.list (backup files first)

10:37	<cwill1>	dot_: ignore that
10:37	<Slart>	CroX: do that.. I'll do some googling.. see if I find another solution

11:01	<dot_>	hai
11:01	<dot_>	brb
11:01	<Necrosan_>	wildintellect: its a known issue on this laptop
11:01	<dublpaws>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: have you tried $nvidia-settings ?
11:01	<Necrosan_>	just wondering if anyones found a solution
11:01	<ganesh>	jotil:i upgraded to 7.10..but desktop effects or compiz is not working
11:01	<xoob>	desktop effects could not be enabled??? why???
11:01	<Sevk>	gordonjcp , no it can record video into gif
11:01	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	dublpaws: no, let me try, hold on
11:01	<lostfaith>	thanks I will try that
11:01	<wildintellect>	Necrosan_,  so it might work for lostfaith
11:01	<c9s_>	i can't find my "Desktop Effect" in my control panel
11:01	<Murphy05>	DEBUG Installing 'language-support-ja' (Distro KeepInstalledSection rule: translations); could this mean that i should remove language support so that the upgrade will go on?
11:01	<c9s_>	how to install it ?
11:01	<XarZen>	jotil: the installer works, but how to get both ubuntu and xp at the same time
11:02	<flick>	hi, how do i rearrange icons in the top panel?
11:02	<jotil>	ganesh: i have the same problem. if you are using nvidia, i'll let you know when i fix my problem.
11:02	<IdleOne>	flick: right click on it and select move
11:02	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: wait a few minutes, i'll brb. need to eat man!
11:02	<Necrosan_>	lostfaith: hey
11:02	<jotil>	XarZen: http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2006/05/08/dual-boot-laptop.html
11:02	<jotil>	that is dual boot
11:02	<Rabiddog>	whats the command to do a distro upgrade
11:02	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	dublpaws: I see tons of errors, like: ERROR: Invalid X Screen 0 specified on line 47 of configuration file '/home/galvao/.nvidia-settings-rc' (NV-CONTROL extension not supported on X Screen 0). but the thing opens
11:03	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: ok
11:03	<Necrosan_>	building a kernel took me forever, by the way
11:03	<flick>	XarZen: you have to install Ubuntu in a different partition by choosing manual in the disc/partition selection instead of guided, etc
11:03	<jotil>	XarZen: dual boot means you can either have XP or Linux running at one time.
11:03	<wildintellect>	Rabiddog, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade I think
11:03	<IdleOne>	Rabiddog: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
11:03	<jotil>	brb
11:03	<Ninjao>	My install of ubuntu gets stuck at step 3 of 7(using the live cd) (just after i enter my keyboard layout) i see it trying to run the partioner but it doesnt start. Can any1 help me?
11:03	<XarZen>	jotil: yeah, ok
11:03	<cwill1>	Rabiddog: if you mean, gutsy upgrade, sudo update-manager -c should do it
11:03	<ganesh>	jotil:i m using ati radion
11:04	<IdleOne>	cwill1: dist-upgrade should do it now
11:04	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	dublpaws: maybe those errors are part of the problem?
11:04	<Murphy05>	yay! here it goes
11:04	<wildintellect>	XarZen, you want to to use vmware or qemu to run one in an emulator
11:04	<openbysource>	guys, i am looking for a cd/dvd burning application in gnome. can someone tell me some of the best applications for that.
11:04	<BankHead>	hello
11:04	<flick>	Ninjao: are you sure that the downloaded iso is not faulty?
11:04	<dot_>	back
11:04	<Ninjao>	it shouldnt be. Ive burnt it and its running fine
11:04	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: ah
11:04	<cwill1>	IdleOne: apt-get dist-upgrade is just the smart upgrade (dependency tracking), I don't think it invokes the full distribution upgrade
11:04	<Ninjao>	im on it atm.. but its just the install
11:04	<XarZen>	wildintellect, instead of installing permanent you mean?
11:05	<flick>	IdleOne: can i move the name (that it shows at the right most part of the panel)?
11:05	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: there is a thing to do that, but I can't remember what it's called
11:05	<dot_>	cwill1: back

11:10	<cousin_luigi>	how do I localize pidgin?
11:10	<jimcooncat>	wildintellect: ty
11:10	<cwill1>	IdleOne: nope, apt-get dist-upgrade won't upgrade to gutsy unless you changes the sources.list by hand, in which case you're in unsupported (but workable) territory anyway :)
11:10	<cwill1>	dot_: no worries
11:10	<wildintellect>	jimcooncat, oh and adobe acrobat might not be 64 but you don't need that
11:10	<Helvasca>	how can I scroll up if Im in a tty?

11:11	<cwill1>	IdleOne:  apt-get dist-upgrade just tells apt to be willing to remove a package if it means it can upgrade another package;   dist-upgrade actually checks to see if there's a new distro release
11:12	<RivaeAerya>	can anybody help me? I can't get into gnome, it only shows the wallpaper and then crashes, no panels etcetera. But on other users it does work

11:14	<cwill1>	ganesh: don't, unless you have a problems
11:14	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	dublpaws: any ideas?
11:14	<dublpaws>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: if Load "dri" is uncommented in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf, try commenting it out.. other than that, I'm not sure what else to try.
11:15	<cwill1>	ganesh: use a generic one matching the hightest res that you know works, if the autodetection doesn't work right
11:15	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	dublpaws: let me take a look at that
11:15	<ganesh>	cwill1: desktop effects or compiz are not working
11:15	<amarillion>	cwill1, I manged to get going with xrandr, mainly with the help of this: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2
11:15	<amarillion>	that link is pretty useful
11:15	<cwill1>	amarillion: good
11:15	<cwill1>	ya, it's all a bit of a gongshow right now, to be honest
11:15	<rothchild>	which compiz tool do I need to change to set the window behaviour so that double clicking the bar at the top of the window maximises / unmaximises it rather than rolling it up in to the bar?
11:15	<jimcooncat>	I need a different torrent client, my bittorrent is only letting me do one file at a time. What's a better gnome torrent client?
11:16	<cwill1>	but its for the best, once they get the kinks ironed out
11:16	<ook_male>	i got software development kit that use for Visual Basic, how to make it run on linux? What is the best programming language to use? It's fingerprint scanner for attendance system, so must use GUI
11:16	<amarillion>	Yeah, it's the price we pay for progress :)
11:16	<cwill1>	ganesh: okay
11:16	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	dublpaws: no, there's nothing like that in there
11:16	<cwill1>	ganesh: what video card?
11:16	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: so convert it to a gif
11:16	<amarillion>	But you're right, I like the way the xrandr tool works
11:16	<rothchild>	jimcooncat azureus is ok but last I tried it wasn't working KTorrent is really excellent though
11:16	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: why specifically do you need gif?
11:16	<ganesh>	cwill1:ati radeon
11:16	<cwill1>	ganesh: radeon or fglrx?
11:17	<cwill1>	ganesh: driver, rather
11:17	<Sevk>	gif is easyly to publish in the web

11:18	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: nope, waiting on you. :)
11:18	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: also, the livecd can test it on boot (there's an option on the loader)
11:18	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: how long a screen capture do you want?
11:18	<hal9000>	has anybody this problem?
11:18	<masternode>	the device seems not supported. any help pls?
11:18	<hal9000>	i have  a 915 gm
11:18	<Sevk>	2 min
11:18	<hal9000>	compiz works
11:18	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: gif would be unsuitable for more than a couple of seconds
11:18	<Sevk>	gordonjcp, see this :  http://wiki.ubuntu.org.cn/images/1/11/Gifgifgifa.gif
11:19	<garu>	I need some help, I lose my wireless connection soon after starting to browse with firefox and then i can only get a connection if I restart the computer.please help
11:19	<cwill1>	garu: what card?
11:19	<Sevk>	why i need gif    :  http://wiki.ubuntu.org.cn/images/1/11/Gifgifgifa.gif
11:19	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: I really tried everything in my little knowledge of it, so it's in your - and in anyone who's willing to help- hands :)
11:19	<hal9000>	i   was not clear?
11:19	<hazman>	i'm having trouble with enabling custom visual effects(compiz fusion) in gutsy and get an error, "Desktop effects cannot be enabled", can someone help plz?
11:19	<rothchild>	which compiz tool do I need to change to set the window behaviour so that double clicking the bar at the top of the window maximises / unmaximises it rather than rolling it up in to the bar?
11:20	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	thanks, cwill1
11:20	<cwill1>	rothchild: install the effects advanced config thingy (not sure the package name, but you should be able to search for it)
11:20	<hal9000>	anybody has a problem wuth the animations effects?
11:20	<cwill1>	rothchild: or you can dig around in gconf-editor
11:20	<rothchild>	yeah I got that but I dunno what the option is called
11:20	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: use mencoder to convert the .ogg to sequentially numbered .gifs, then use convert to turn them into an animated gif
11:20	<cwill1>	ganesh: still therE?
11:21	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: alternatively, capture with istanbul, turn the ogg into an .flv, and use something like Anarchy Media Player to embed it on a web page
11:21	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: Actually I'm already convinced that I'll have to make a clean install, but if you can find the solution it would be awesome, since the problem may occur again
11:21	<ganesh>	cwill1:http://pastebin.org/5298
11:21	<Sevk>	gordonjcp, it is only 56K
11:21	<Sevk>	56k size
11:21	<ganesh>	cwill1:sorry for delayed reply
11:21	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: what are you running into?
11:21	<cwill1>	np
11:22	<hal9000>	mmm escuse-me...to whom i can ask?
11:22	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: the problem WILL occur again. i am working on a clean install.
11:22	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: oh my...
11:22	<cwill1>	ganesh: send me your xorg.conf
11:22	<JimPD>	Why is the "Last modified" date of the .iso on releases.ubuntu.com/7.10 16 October instead of 18? Was nothing changed in the last two days?
11:22	<madmonk>	hi there
11:22	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: whats the problemwhats the problemwhats the problem :p
11:22	<Sevk>	gordonjcp,  I have previously converted ,but the size is very big.
11:22]  * cwill1 is high on coffee
11:22	<rothchild>	hal9000 do you have compiz config settings manager installed?
11:22	<hal9000>	y
11:23	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: Basically I have a Nvidia 6200 and I can't make it work with OpenGL. If I enable the restricted drivers, X comes in low graphics mode after I restart
11:23	<c9s_>	can i change decorator to gtk ? ( compiz )
11:23	<hal9000>	i have animations abilitaded

11:23	<hal9000>	burn etc etc doesn't work
11:23	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: ya, you definately need the restricted driver (nv doesn't have any 3d accel)
11:23	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: do you have a second machine you can still talk on?
11:23	<madmonk>	I'm on Ubuntu Gutsy fresh install, I've done everything I could read on wiki an forum but I can't see DVDs with totem...can you help me?
11:23	<cwill1>	ganesh: xorg.conf, not glxinfo :p
11:23	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: Nope :(
11:24	<cwill1>	unless you pasted it before, I didn't see the link
11:24	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: hmm, that's gonna make it more complicated
11:24	<rothchild>	are you sure compiz is running?
11:24	<pawan>	hi
11:24	<pawan>	how to upgrade
11:24	<hal9000>	in tghe italian forum
11:24	<IdleOne>	!dvd | madmonk
11:24	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: Tell me about it
11:24	<Maligen>	hi
11:24	<garu>	cwill1 I did a dmesg | tail to see what was wrong before and after losing connection
11:24	<hal9000>	other 2 people have this problem
11:24	<pawan>	from 7.04 to 7.10
11:24	<hal9000>	but the solution is far
11:24	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: how comfortable are you in the command line?
11:24	<IdleOne>	ubotu: ping
11:24	<BMK>	hej hej någon svensk här?
11:24	<theshibboleth>	is there a settings manager for compiz that isn't installed by default?
11:24	<hal9000>	the incredible thing is that in feisty + beryl all was ok
11:24	<Maligen>	can some1 write to me, I have wireless network problems (ubuntu 7.10)
11:25	<ganesh>	cwill1:its saying bad command..
11:25	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: best bet is to boot into single user mode, edit xorg.conf in one console, and keep running 'Xorg' until to works fine
11:25	<cwill1>	ganesh: /etc/X11/xorg.conf is the file, sorry
11:25	<pawan>	some lock error
11:25	<madmonk>	!dvd
11:25	<madmonk>	?
11:25	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: Pretty comfortable. I'm not an "advanced" user, but I can find my way
11:25	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: how's your vim or nano?
11:25	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: How do I do that. init 3 and?
11:25	<madmonk>	I used to install libdvdcss2 ...
11:25	<hal9000>	cwill1 do you knpow something about my problem?
11:25	<brickbat_>	hi I'm having a problem with gutsy
11:25	<CroX>	BMK: Joina #ubuntu-se
11:25	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: I love vim
11:25	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: well, ctrl+alt+f1, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, and then have fun :)
11:25	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: but install the driver first,
11:26	<madmonk>	but it seems like this pckg doesn't exist no more
11:26	<rothchild>	madmonk http://www.medibuntu.org/index.php
11:26	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: I haven't worked with my own nvidea before, but I've talked others through _some_ of it
11:26	<pawan>	what is this upgrade tool
11:26	<rothchild>	add the repo and you can have w32codecs libdvd etc
11:26	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: ok, but what if it keeps doing the annoying low graphics mode?
11:26	<garu>	madmonk there's libdvdread
11:26	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: but if you can get a checkerboard showing up when you run Xorg, then you should be good to reboot
11:26	<Maligen>	can some1 help me in wireless problems ?
11:26	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: Xorg won't do it
11:26	<theshibboleth>	or is there a cheat sheet somewhere describing how to get some of the cooler effects of compiz, like the cube and that?
11:26	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: it's gdm than confuses matters :)
11:26	<madmonk>	yep....I didn't try after added medibuntu :p
11:26	<pulz0r>	Maligen, what is your problem?
11:27	<madmonk>	now I have libdvdcss2
11:27	<madmonk>	we'll see
11:27	<rothchild>	cool
11:27	<hal9000>	mmm i can't resolve...i think
11:27	<ganesh>	cwill1:permission denied..y?i ran it even as su
11:27	<Maligen>	on ubuntu page they said if you have rt2500 based wireless card, 7.10 solve all your problem
11:27	<cwill1>	madmonk: gutsy, you should just need to install ubuntu-extras-restricted, no extra repo's necessary
11:27	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: But the screen I see with the low graphic message is definetely Xorg's
11:27	<Sevk>	Similarly in, look at this GIF, http://wiki.ubuntu.org.cn/images/8/8f/Vnc_own.gif
11:27	<Sevk>	It only 81K
11:27	<madmonk>	holy crap!
11:27	<madmonk>	rnothing!
11:27	<cwill1>	ganesh: ??

11:27	<Tigerman>	hello

11:28	<madmonk>	now I have libdvdcss2 but still totem doesn't see dvd!
11:28	<cwill1>	ganesh: don't run it
11:28	<pawan>	how to upgrade
11:28	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: How do I run Xorg by hand?
11:28	<cwill1>	ganesh: gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and paste the contents
11:28	<Lifeisfunny>	With Compiz I've got missing titlebars and decorations so I'm trying to install Emerald but I get a warning window saying,   Depends: libwnck18 (>=2.15.90) but it is not installable
11:28	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: stop gdm, and then type Xorg
11:28	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: ctrl+alt+backspace to kill it
11:28	<brickbat_>	when I try use the desktop cube or the ctrl-down thing to switch desktops, the desktops are missing the actual stuff thats running on them and the apps that are on my first page are on my gnome panel on all the desktops instead of the one for each desktop
11:28	<pawan>	hello

11:29	<Lifeisfunny>	pawan, open the update manager in System/Administration

11:30	<pawan>	then
11:30	<hal9000>	compiz works
11:30	<cwill1>	hal9000: if xserver-xorg-video-intel doesn't work, you're out of luck for anything reasonably performing
11:30	<teckfatt>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: please wait
11:30	<Maligen>	well, I downloaded the firmware with the restricted driver manager, the lights on the card are on, but I have no connection with the network

11:31	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	Oh I must stay a little bit more, 20 or 30 minutes, downloading the iso
11:31	<cwill1>	hal9000: then the particular chipset may not be able to display it accelerated
11:31	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	:P
11:31	<hal9000>	but
11:31	<cwill1>	hal9000: yes?  :)

11:33	<Lifeisfunny>	pawan, about that lock ... have you tried the password you use when logging on?
11:33	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: it worked for me
11:33	<cwill1>	lostfaith: ctrl+f, search for it that way I think
11:33	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	so, teckfatt how do I re-enable it afterwards?
11:33	<pawan>	yes
11:33	<weltall>	how do i remove entirely the backlight managent in gnome on ubuntu gutsy? please i'm having an headcache with this constantly changing brightness!
11:34	<Keef_>	how can I alternate between two working soundcards?
11:34	<pawan>	some update application is already running
11:34	<cwill1>	okay
11:34	<cwill1>	ganesh:
11:34	<hal9000>	cwill1 have you seen?
11:34	<teckfatt>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: you start the x manually with the command # startx and enable it
11:34	<pulz0r>	Maligen, how did you try to make a networkconnection?
11:34	<Tigerman>	what's the window manager of gutsy called now?
11:34	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: i got mine fixed. sigh.
11:34	<cwill1>	ganesh: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
11:34	<Tigerman>	what's the window manager of gutsy called now? metacity?
11:34	<marx2k>	Hmmm...
11:34	<Maligen>	pulz0r, do you see what I write to you in pvt ?
11:34	<cwill1>	ganesh: and then change defaultdepth and depth to 16, and then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart to reset the session, tell me what it does
11:34	<Lifeisfunny>	pawan, I think you need root privileges
11:35	<pawan>	i am on the root
11:35	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	teckfatt: ok, just let me check if I understood correctly. I enable the driver, disable GDM and then I start X manually and re-enable it and that's it?
11:35	<hal9000>	cwill1 now i will try with the live
11:35	<Lifeisfunny>	Tigerman, yeah, metacity

11:36	<cwill1>	hal9000: videoram in the device section, ya
11:36	<teckfatt>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: what is ur question again?
11:36	<Baltazaar>	tried deleting the whole human theme, but... that didn't do it
11:36	<hal9000>	kk
11:36	<cwill1>	hal9000: but try the livecd first
11:36	<madmonk>	...
11:36	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	teckfatt: ok, just let me check if I understood correctly. I enable the driver, disable GDM and then I start X manually and re-enable it and that's it?

11:36	<pawan>	some third party sources disabled
11:36	<marx2k>	(by fine I mean not very well at all...)
11:36	<Lifeisfunny>	pawan, can you do the terminal commandline ....  sudo apt-get upgrade
11:37	<pawan>	ok
11:37	<pulz0r>	 well, Im not seeing anything at all, but my guess is you dont use tab and wrote my nick wrong :/
11:37	<teckfatt>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: what is ur problem?
11:37	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	teckfatt: ?
11:37	<SNy>	Maligen: Because Freenode restricts PMs to identified users.
11:37	<marx2k>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, sto;; cant figure it out, huh?
11:37	<marx2k>	still
11:37	<teckfatt>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: can u repeat ur question, what u want to do with the X?
11:37	<cwill1>	back
11:37	<Maligen>	shall I register or something ?
11:38	<marx2k>	It doesnt seem as though "nvidia" driver will work, while "nv" works, sort of...
11:38	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: no, man, I'm on top of this for the last 8 hours or so
11:38	<SNy>	Yes, if you want to send PMs.
11:38	<amarillion>	How do I customize desktop effects in gutsy? I want more than just three options...
11:38	<SNy>	Should be a FAQ entry somewhere on freenode web.
11:38	<marx2k>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, I somehow got it to work with my 6200 GeForce downstairs
11:38	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: I'm just here because I feel guilty:  gutsy worked flawlessly on my laptop, even the wireless works after a couple clicks
11:38	<marx2k>	but the 6800 is a no go
11:38	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	teckfatt: your proposed solution
11:38	<cwill1>	amarillion: there's a package in synaptic
11:39	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: mine is 6200, any tips appreciated
11:39	<teckfatt>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: i think i missed ur question, i thought u want to disable the X on startup
11:39	<Maligen>	I'm going to register brb
11:39	<Lifeisfunny>	what's the visual effects available from the System/Preferences/Appearance <tab>Visual Effects
11:39	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: oh don't feel guilty, just help me lol
11:39	<CroX>	I can't get my Nvidia card to work under Gutsy.. Anyone care to help me out?
11:39	<cwill1>	amarillion: compizconfig-settings-manager I think
11:39	<amarillion>	thanks
11:39	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	teckfatt: oh, got it now, ok
11:39	<amarillion>	btw, appearences manager said that it couldn't enable desktop effects, even though now they are in fact enabled
11:39	<ChaosParser>	are the repos incredibly slow tonight, or is it just me?
11:40	<amarillion>	That's probably a known issue
11:40	<flokuehn>	CroX: are there any error msgs
11:40	<cwill1>	amarillion: uh
11:40	<cwill1>	amarillion: upgrade?
11:40	<marx2k>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, It seems like running "sudo nvidia-xconfig" did it for me (and of course playing with nvidia-settings, but Im sure you did that
11:40	<digitalspaghetti>	Eclipse/Aptana plugin for Eclipse really hate the 7.10 update :(
11:40	<gafatoa>	hello
11:40	<cwill1>	amarillion: you've probably got a conflict between the manually installed version
11:40	<Lifeisfunny>	ChaosParser, it's slow for everyone
11:40	<cwill1>	digitalspaghetti: wats aptana?
11:40	<CroX>	flokuehn: Nope, I all get is the "Ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode".
11:40	<ChaosParser>	Lifeisfunny: Thanks, thats what I figured. :)
11:40	<flokuehn>	CroX: did you try the envy script?
11:40	<garu>	how do i reinstall firefox?
11:40	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: I'll try. Running nvidia-settings prints a lot of error messages on the terminal, while it eventually opens
11:41	<flokuehn>	CroX: maybe you have to try the envy script
11:41	<CroX>	flokuehn: The what?
11:41	<flokuehn>	CroX: mom
11:41	<Lifeisfunny>	ChaosParser, take into consideration everyone might be trying to gain acces
11:41	<marx2k>	when I run "sudo nvidia-settings" here it tells me "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file (just run `nvidia-xconfig` as root), and restart the X server. "
11:41	<cwill1>	garu: synaptic, find it, select reinstall;  but I don't think it'll fix whatever your problem is
11:41	<cwill1>	garu: what are you running into?
11:41	<flokuehn>	CroX: http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
11:41	<tapoxi>	Hello. I've installed the flash plugin, but for some reason I can't click any buttons in flash videos or animations. I can't click to play a video, for example.
11:41	<Lifeisfunny>	garu, you can try through synaptic
11:41	<gafatoa>	got a problem with the 7.10: when I enable compiz the windows loose their title bar. Is it a known problem ?
11:41	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: Here I got tons of error messages
11:41	<Beket>	Greetings people. I have ubuntu feisty, but when I try to install openssh-server I get reports regarding broken packages. Is this a known issue? What am I missing? Thank you
11:41	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: Want me to pastebin them?
11:41	<flokuehn>	CroX: this the link. read the text an have a try it
11:41	<garu>	cwill1 I lose my wireless connection every now and then
11:42	<cwill1>	Beket: broken packages is something you broke before :p
11:42	<CroX>	flokuehn: Thanks, I'll try that.
11:42	<marx2k>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, nah Ive been at it for about 6 hours now... im going to bed ...stupid Gutsy...breaking my stupid system...
11:42	<cwill1>	garu: that won't be firefox
11:42	<OVM>	hola_
11:42	<cwill1>	Beket: what packages does it say are broken?
11:42	<Lifeisfunny>	gafatoa, same with me.... With Compiz I've got missing titlebars and decorations so I'm trying to install Emerald but I get a warning window saying,   Depends: libwnck18 (>=2.15.90) but it is not installable
11:42	<flokuehn>	CroX: it seems working for a lot of people
11:42	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: I know the feeling. Have a good rest, mate
11:42	<garu>	cwill1 and I can only get it back after restarting the computer.Yeah, but, the weird thing is that, it only happens when I open firefox and start browsing the web
11:42	<gafatoa>	Lifeisfunny, happy :-( to know that I am not alone !
11:42	<marx2k>	later... maybe tomorrow theyll fix it with proper kernel modules
11:43	<OVM>	hola como puedo entrar en spanish chanel_
11:43	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	marx2k: heh :)
11:43	<cwill1>	garu: still not firefox
11:43	<Beket>	cwill1: it says something like: openssh-server: depends on openssh-client: it won't be installed (sorry for the inaccurate translation -- the actual messages are in greek)
11:43	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	OVM: Try /join #ubuntu-es
11:43	<cwill1>	garu: does anything show up in /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages?
11:43	<Lifeisfunny>	gafatoa, I don't like to use the phrase but uh, misery loves company?
11:43	<cwill1>	Beket: does it say why the client won't be installed?  (should already be installed)
11:43	<hislop>	Could not find player commands. what is this mean?
11:44	<Tigerman>	i want to disable the Main Menu pop-up descriptions... how to do that?

11:44	<L0GAN>	huh gobunto?
11:44	<rothchild>	how do I force compiz to use metacity themes instead of emerald
11:44	<Mr_Bunny_>	I installed compizconfig-settings-manager, but I can't find it in the menu and can't seem to launch it from terminal either.
11:44	<gafatoa>	Lifeisfunny, right !
11:44	<L0GAN>	!gobuntu

11:44	<pawan>	is the new version good or the old
11:44	<cwill1>	Tigerman: I don't think there is such an option;  might google gnome for it though
11:44	<hislop>	!youtube
11:44	<ubotwo>	Sorry, I know nothing about that - try http://help.ubuntu.com/community/
11:44	<garu>	cwill1 I did dmesg | tail and I got something...the first weird thing I got is that it says wlano address duplicate and the other one, gave me another error...I did it twice, one before losing the connection and the other one after

11:44	<Beket>	cwill1: it doesn't as far as i can see.. perhaps I messed up with the repositories ? any way to just reset the whole thing and be sure that everything will work ok for now one ?
11:45	<Tigerman>	now i don't know where that setting was
11:45	<cwill1>	Tigerman: well then, :p
11:45	<Lifeisfunny>	Tigerman, the tooltips?

11:45	<Tigerman>	they are annoying
11:45	<Tigerman>	i wanna disable them
11:45	<Mr_Bunny_>	LOGAN: not really, it's google's internal version of ubuntu.
11:45	<Mr_Bunny_>	LOGAN: they aren't going to release it to the public, though, they've said
11:45	<cwill1>	Beket: tell me what it says if you try sudo apt-get install openssh-client
11:46	<hazman>	jeez, the repositories are getting absolutely hammered
11:46	<cousin_luigi>	back
11:46	<cwill1>	L0GAN: yes, it's new

11:50	<Beket>	cwill1: feisty
11:50	<madmonk>	mmm..lots of problems on international forum with gutsy and dvd
11:50	<cwill1>	L0GAN: there's probably a deb you can download from their site, it's not in the current repo's though
11:50	<L0GAN>	rsk live CD
11:50	<garu>	can someone tell me of wmaster0 is really needed?
11:51	<cwill1>	Beket: okay, check if there's some updates to apply via synaptic

11:51	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cwill1: Running a clean install should be fine since I have my home in a separate partition, right? Should I expect any problems for doing a clean install of gutsy over an upgraded one?
11:51	<schregge>	i am using the xen kernel....
11:51	<cwill1>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: I wouldn't expect any problems, unless you've got some special configed software that you're particularily attached to
11:51	<L0GAN>	rsk if its deactivated under live cd while others are not, maybe you're confused by update remaining original selected before ?

11:54	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	Hi cousin_luigi
11:54	<L0GAN>	btw is there a Ubuntu live DVD?
11:54	<cwill1>	Bo^Dick: presume that it works for 90% of those who try it :p
11:54	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	:)
11:54	<cwill1>	Bo^Dick: what are you running into?
11:54	<subwaydesign>	i'm kind of desperated hehe
11:54	<cousin_luigi>	hi ZaphodBeeblebrox

11:54	<ubotwo>	Failed.
11:54	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: nope, same here

11:55	<choudesh>	This is going to be a fun day, its 7am and I am upgrading from dapper to gutsy. :-D
11:55	<garu>	anyone having wireless problems with 7.10?
11:55	<cwill1>	choudesh: ha
11:55	<subwaydesign>	i'll be reading that. thanks!
11:55	<cwill1>	choudesh: sure you don't want to wait for hardy?
11:55	<jotil>	subwaydesign: did you *by mistake* remove XP? can access the XP partition?
11:55	<subwaydesign>	no, xp is there
11:55	<cwill1>	choudesh: I'd imagine they'll make that upgrade (lts to lts) easier
11:56	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: I'm just finishing downloading the iso then I'll follow some advices from cwill1, come back to check on jotil and then if everything fails I'll jump off the window lmao
11:56	<choudesh>	cwill1, nah - this in on my dedicated test box.
11:56	<subwaydesign>	i just run the update, and after rebooting, it was gone from the grub list
11:56	<subwaydesign>	partition is intact
11:56	<choudesh>	cwill1, on my actual server I hope they do that.
11:56	<subwaydesign>	just the grub list changed
11:56	<Bo^Dick>	i tried the upgrader two times
11:56	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: mine is working now
11:56	<cousin_luigi>	lol @zaphod:)
11:56	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: How did you fixed?
11:56	<Bo^Dick>	i got the same error mess both times
11:56	<Black4lpha>	can anyone help me to get my usb headphone to work with VLC?
11:56	<Bo^Dick>	bad md5dum in an archive
11:56	<cwill1>	choudesh: I did it a few days ago, wasn't too bad actually
11:57	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: let me reboot and see if i really do it right
11:57	<subwaydesign>	i'm on a sata. XP is on sda1
11:57	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: sure thing
11:57	<cwill1>	choudesh:  just slow going confirming customized /etc's
11:57	<cousin_luigi>	Black4lpha: can you use your usb phone elsewhere?
11:57	<choudesh>	cwill1, Well, I don't have phyiscal access to this box - plus no internet-accessable reboots
11:57	<cwill1>	choudesh: uhhhhhh :p
11:57	<Bo^Dick>	maybe the installer tried to use the downloaded deb with bad checksum?
11:57	<cwill1>	choudesh: good luck with that :)
11:58	<cwill1>	Bo^Dick: should just be in /tmp, delete it and try again
11:58	<choudesh>	cwill1, I am praying.
11:58	<Bo^Dick>	i did not upgrade from command prompt
11:58]  * choudesh prays.
11:58	<Bo^Dick>	i tried the update manager
11:58	<cwill1>	choudesh: I'd also suggest starting an extra sshd on a different port, and keep a root prompt open on that
11:58	<Bo^Dick>	cwiiis: thanks
11:58	<cwill1>	choudesh: that way you don't get killed when the pam update restarted /etc/init.d/gdm
11:58	<Bo^Dick>	cwiiis: gonna try now
11:58	<cwill1>	choudesh: oh, and make sure you run it from a screen session
11:59	<Cryoniq>	Anyone running radeon 9800 pro on gutsy?
11:59	<cwill1>	choudesh: apt-get doesn't like it when the session disappears because of a dropped connection :)
11:59	<choudesh>	cwill1, good idea. though it still needs to reboot.
11:59	<Keef_>	how can I select a default soundcard, I have two?
11:59	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	omg lol GIMP's new logo is awesome! (Sorry I have to chill a little)
11:59	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: yeah fixed
11:59	<cwill1>	choudesh: yes, but if you lose your connection during the upgrade, you're screwed :)
11:59	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: Way to go! Tell me! :)

12:01	<UNDERsoN>	where I can dowload dvd with ubuntu I can't find
12:01	<whitedeth>	anyone know if there's a reason half my repositories just wont download AT ALL?
12:01	<whitedeth>	like straight up errors?
12:01	<CroX>	flokuehn: Now no special keys (swedish, at, dollar sign, etc) will work.. Any solution to this?
12:01	<whitedeth>	ive been trying to download Konversation for like, 2 hours now.
12:01	<UNDERsoN>	with 7.10
12:01	<whitedeth>	keeps saying that
12:01	<TheWood>	Do i need to rebuild a 7.04 box to install 7.10 or can it be upgraded please?
12:01	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	whitedeth: The servers are probably overloaded
12:01	<whitedeth>	so ive got nothing to worry about?
12:01	<whitedeth>	should just leave it for a few days?
12:01	<UNDERsoN>	where I can dowload dvd iso with 7.10
12:01	<cwill1>	TheWood: in principle, it upgrades fine, although if you've experimented with repositories, you might have trouble
12:02	<cwill1>	google it
12:02	<cwill1>	UNDERsoN:
12:02	<whitedeth>	UNDERsoN look on ubuntu.com
12:02	<choudesh>	whitedeth, switch do a different mirror, if you can't find one that works well, I will give you my personal one @ houdeshell.net
12:02	<whitedeth>	oh
12:02	<whitedeth>	that would be awesome
12:02	<whitedeth>	im currently in XP
12:02	<whitedeth>	but I'll switch over and set it up if you dont mind?
12:02	<UNDERsoN>	cwill1 I can't find there only cd iso
12:02	<choudesh>	whitedeth, no prob.
12:02	<whitedeth>	wanna pm me the details?
12:02	<flokuehn>	CroX: it maybe that you have to reconfigure your xorg file
12:03	<flokuehn>	CroX: you know how it works?
12:03	<whitedeth>	im not a pro with ubuntu. I'm not quite sure where im even supposed to be putting it in.
12:03	<jotil>	whitedeth: the servers seems to be overloaded. every time i apt something, it takes a while to start downloading and the speed is slow!
12:03	<choudesh>	whitedeth, first try mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu if that doesn't work - I will send you the stuff for thor.houdeshell.net
12:03	<CroX>	flokuehn: I fixed it. But when I fixed it, it complained about some error configuring XKB. But apparently it works now.
12:04	<flokuehn>	CroX: ok
12:04	<flokuehn>	nice
12:04	<Bo^Dick>	it looks like the installer actually downloads the package every time
12:04	<L0GAN>	uhoh, I have flat 32, a dvd image of 4336MB will not fir, right?
12:04	<whitedeth>	okay choudesh thanks a lot.
12:04	<Bo^Dick>	at 244k/sek download speed
12:04	<flokuehn>	CroX: maybe you can fix the xkb error by reconfiguring your xserver
12:04	<Tigerman>	hello again
12:04	<Tigerman>	i have a problem
12:04	<flokuehn>	CroX: but you have to google for it before doing so
12:04	<subwaydesign>	i couldn't find any solution for my grub problem on those sites
12:04	<Bo^Dick>	now lets see if the installer will complain about the checksum
12:05	<choudesh>	whitedeth, I am pulling from both kernel.org and houdeshell.net @ 1729kps and 2781kps
12:05	<Bo^Dick>	gonna be intresting
12:05	<subwaydesign>	:(
12:05	<CroX>	flokuehn: Maybe. But now it doesn't seem to be a problem so I'll leave it alone for now. Already lost several work hours due to the problems with Gutsy.. :/
12:05	<dystopianray>	L0GAN: that sounds like it should fit
12:05	<whitedeth>	wow.
12:05	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: i just went inside /lib/linux-restricted-modules and backed up the nvidia directories and deleted them
12:05	<whitedeth>	choudesh where exactly do I put mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu into?
12:05	<dystopianray>	L0GAN: oh wait sorry, you mean you have a fat32 parittion, no that file will not fit on it
12:05	<whitedeth>	to change it to that?
12:05	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: ok, then what?
12:05	<choudesh>	whitedeth, well, the easy way is to use the gui
12:05	<whitedeth>	i like easy :P
12:06	<choudesh>	whitedeth, System->Admin->Software Sources
12:06	<whitedeth>	oh okay.
12:06	<whitedeth>	sweet.
12:06	<whitedeth>	thanks dude, ill switch over and do it now.
12:06	<PriceChild>	!test
12:06	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: and then i added that line "DISABLED_MODULES="nv nvidia_new" in /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common

12:06	<ubotu>	Failed.
12:06	<PriceChild>	ubotwo, part
12:06	<flokuehn>	CroX:ok
12:06	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: Ok, anything else?
12:07	<snadge>	why would gutsy resolve my hostnames to 1.0.0.0 if i use telnet.. and resolves correctly if i use ping? .. this does not happen with feisty or windows xp obviously.. i worked around the behaviour by setting my dns manually to the dns assigned to my dlink adsl modem, which is acting as a router and the default dns address
12:07	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: then ran the nvidia binary
12:07	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	jotil: hmmm I can't do that I don't have the source here
12:07	<jotil>	that's all
12:07	<cousin_luigi>	brb
12:07	<Bo^Dick>	the installer whines about this file: http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/ghc6/ghc6_6.6.1-2ubuntu2_i386.deb

12:15	<benzon>	then the !info mscorefonts shut say msttcorefonts
12:15	<choudesh>	Amaranth: yea, but the update-manager won't let you update unless you have one of the base packages installed (ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop...); and since you have to apt-get install one - it takes a long time.
12:15	<gonzo_>	what's gdesklets?

Anyone have any leads what could be wrong or help me with some troubleshoot process? :)

12:24	<Moult>	Yes, it is a very very old machine.

12:26	<Myrtti>	Crozar: I read it, what am I supposed to do now? wave my hands above my head and scream?

12:52	<Helvasca>	hal9000: are you trying to test all the affects?
12:52	<SleepingSloth>	Pici,  i already seem to have linux-generic - so is it just a case of booting to that kernel?
12:52	<jrib>	test___: no
12:52	<nicholas>	Maglite: nope. something funky in your hw support. maybe dmesg orsuch will tell you. I don't have it here for sure
12:52	<rsk>	test___: no
12:52	<hal9000>	as i have an intel 915 gm
12:52	<BrendanJ>	So I have an ralink rt61 chipset wifi card, that worked fine in fiesty. But in Gutsy, it doesn't seem to work. I tried doing a "modprobe rt61" but I get "FATAL: Module rt61 not found." Did they really remove this module, and if so, why? Where can I get it back?
12:52	<hal9000>	driver is intel
12:53	<jrib>	!firewall >	test___ (read the private message from ubotu)

12:53	<hal9000>	in the animation section
12:53	<Pici>	SleepingSloth: Looks like it, If that doesnt work, remove it and re-install it
12:53	<hal9000>	other plugin works
12:53	<rjonesx>	hmm, i rebooted and now it goes straight to the command line.
12:53	<hal9000>	and before with 7.04] beryl
12:53	<compengi>	how to check if the flags are correct for my home directory
12:53	<hal9000>	plus sorry

12:54	<garu>	BrendanJ what graphics card?
12:54	<rsk>	nach0s: search for it with locate or slocate
12:54	<BrendanJ>	garu, really? Does rt61 show up in "lsmod"?
12:55	<compengi>	jrib, i mean if the the home directory permission is set correctly

12:56	<IdleOne>	rjonesx: is this a fresh install?
12:56	<BrendanJ>	is there a way I can just download that module from Ubuntu?
12:56	<garu>	BrendanJ yep!did you install restricted drivers?
12:56	<rjonesx>	IdleOne: no, I ran the update manager

12:57	<garu>	Odd-rationale I think I'll just borrow someone's lappy to try it on :D
12:57	<IdleOne>	rjonesx: at terminal try typing startx see what happens
12:57	<BrendanJ>	garu, I shouldn't have to. The rt61 driver is open source.
12:57	<jrib>	momal: what does 'lsb_release -a' return?
12:57	<BrendanJ>	I'd be willing to give that a shot, though

12:58	<Maligen>	can someone help me ? I've got wireless (broadcom) problems on [Ubuntu 7.10]

12:58	<lasselasse>	jrib: I did, it' at max
12:58	<BrendanJ>	garu, the only thing that shows up in restricted drivers for me is a Software Modem Driver
12:58	<momal>	Brendanj: It says description: ubuntu 7.10, release: 7.10, codename: gutsy
12:58	<BrendanJ>	I never use the modem, so I don't care about that
12:59	<BrendanJ>	momal, what?
12:59	<garu>	BrendanJ on my lsmod I got rt61pci and rt2x00pci and also rt2x00lib

12:59	<ramvi>	jrib, cant I find the string in launchpad and just translate it again?
12:59	<Maligen>	Brendanj do you also have wireless problems ?
[13:00	<jrib>	Bo^Dick: apt should do that for you
[13:00	<momal>	Brendanj: It seems to just return that it is gutsy... hmm maybe i should run the upgrade and see what it does
[13:00	<IdleOne>	rjonesx: not sure what that means but you could try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop for gnome or kubuntu-desktop ( kde ) and re-install/install a GUI

[13:02	<Innomen>	Whats a polite time to wait before repeating a request?
[13:02	<mbone>	I can't upgrade to 7.10
[13:02	<Helvasca>	mbone: why is that?
[13:02	<proog>	how do i make xchat-gnome minimize to system tray?
[13:02	<Maligen>	garu: I can't establish connection
[13:02	<Innomen>	5 10 minutes? or more
[13:02	<VSpike>	Ugh ... mirc... haven't seen *this* for a while
[13:02	<lgc__>	Innomen, INFTY, in theory...:).
[13:03	<vlt>	Hello. I found the value "MaxRequestSize" for cupsd.conf and set it to "0" (which should be default, I thought) but that doesn't help. A large print job (33 MB) causes the printer to be stopped with "Print file was not accepted (client-error-request-value-too-long)!". Any idea what the problem is here?
[13:03	<seamus7>	Innomen: I wait til my question scrolls out of sight
[13:03	<chippy>	thats 5 seconds
[13:03	<garu>	Maligen but, can ur system detect ur wireless network?
[13:03	<Innomen>	lgc: heheh noted: seamus: that seems too soon for me :)
[13:03	<seamus7>	chippy: usually not
[13:03	<BrendanJ>	garu, any idea how to set modules to load on startup?
[13:03	<Maligen>	yes, I donwloaded the firmware via Restricted Driver Manager, and the leds on the card are on
[13:03	<Helvasca>	mbone, what errors are you getting, are you doing an install from a live cd/alternate install or are you using the dist upgrade from feisty?
[13:03	<Maligen>	so I think the system detects it :P

[13:04	<mbone>	Helvasca: I can't find the upgrade to 7.10 in Update Manager, and I already read a similiar problem in ubuntu forum too. Nothing helps so far
[13:04	<crazy_bus>	upgraded to gutsy.  But my core2duo with intel graphics is still freezing at random times.  Any idea of how to fix it?
[13:04	<dan-g>	Got a question relating to WINE and games... if this isnt the place to ask it can someone direct me to the right place?
[13:04	<seamus7>	BrendanJ: isn't that in /etc/modules?
[13:04	<jrib>	ramvi: not sure how to search translations, try #ubuntu-bugs maybe
[13:04	<VSpike>	BrendanJ: apparently, it's going to download 40MB of digikam plugin docs :)
[13:04	<lgc__>	Innomen, but if you break the etiquette, hell'll break loose and you'll get your attention...:).
[13:04	<BrendanJ>	seamus, maybe?
[13:04	<wilhart>	i've lost all applications in "menu", how do i recreate them?

[13:04	<dan-g>	thank you pici
[13:05	<mbone>	so I'm downloading Alternative CD and see ...
[13:05	<seamus7>	BrendanJ:okay?
[13:05	<Pici>	wilhart: Right click on the menu, go to edit and there should be a button in there to revert.
[13:05	<askand>	Is there anyone here who got tracker working good..?
[13:05	<Helvasca>	mbone, ok then, I'm just looking to see if I can find a fix
[13:05	<lgc__>	Innomen, there's bigotry in here, allright.
[13:05	<Maligen>	garu, any idea ?
[13:05	<seamus7>	askand: I removed the Deskbar and just used the standalone tracker search out of the Accessories menu
[13:05	<Zambezi>	Anyone with C2D who can do me a huge favour? Run stress --cpu 8 --timeout 10s and provide me with the result?
[13:06	<Innomen>	lgc__:  i complain about ubuntu's reliance on command line, i use enter as punctuation, i dont like being called names and i'm affraid to mention my favorite pizza toppings :P
[13:06	<askand>	seamus7: and then it works good for you?
[13:06	<Innomen>	lgc__: you know anything about external drives?
[13:06	<seamus7>	askand: once it finishes its initial indexing ... which may take a while depending on what directories you have it watching
[13:06	<lgc__>	Innomen, I might.
[13:06	<mbone>	Everyone upgrade to 7.10 fine, right ? Maybe there is something wrong with the Update Manager >	<

[13:19	<VSpike>	Anyone seen similar?
[13:19	<RobotBanana>	seamus7: Thanks. So then it's safe to just wipe the Ubuntu partition? Grub won't get damaged?
[13:19	<BrendanJ>	so I downloaded the tar.gz of the rt61 module I need. How do I compile it?
[13:19	<Odd-rationale>	yokomo: np

[13:21	<Maligen>	garu: shall I whisper to u ?
[13:21	<Reuben>	Good evening everyone. This is my second time trying to get ubuntu to dual boot after a FRESH install with Windows XP Pro. What I did was install Windows XP Pro first, then boot into livecd, started installation, let the installer resize the partition through guided mode (all default settings), and then rebooted the system. Upon reboot it now says Error Loading Operating System...
[13:21	<jrib>	mini-me: alt-f2 won't take you anywhere
[13:21	<seamus7>	RobotBana: right. just reinstall ubuntu overtop your old installation and when the partition manager comes up allow it to reformat your file system ... if you installed your home directory into its own partition then you would NOT reformat that unless it was a completely fresh installation
[13:21	<Reuben>	what should i do?
[13:21	<Helvasca>	SuperPigs: do you want to forward say Mozilla to the computer your on? do the computer your on have X running?
[13:21	<mbone>	Helvasca: thank you for that :) but i think I should wait for the Alternate CD and do a more stable upgrade :)
[13:21	<VSpike>	rjonesx: /etc/apt/sources.list
[13:21	<Maglite>	nicholas: Turns out it was the google toolbar that was doing something. When I disabled it, it works like a charm, too bad I cannot use the toolbar though...
[13:21	<IdleOne>	mini-me: alt-f2 opens a run application window nothing to come back from
[13:21	<toxix>	rjonesx: /etc/apt/sources.list
[13:21	<mini-me>	jrib: was thinking of the console thing :)
[13:21	<darkanyel>	hello everybody i can't install firefox extensions help!
[13:21	<seamus7>	RobotBana: grub will be reinstalled and it will detect windows and all will be swell
[13:21	<RobotBanana>	seamus7: Great, thanks. :D
[13:22	<IdleOne>	mini-me: if you mean ctrl-alt-f2 then you do ctrl-alt-f7

[13:22	<mini-me>	jrib: have done what you asked, what should it do?
[13:22	<SuperPigs>	helvasca i have no idea if that is done via client or cmd or something else
[13:22	<VSpike>	I'm hating it so far
[13:22	<Helvasca>	mbone: thats the best way to go, remember to back up your data, and if possible have a seperate home partion!

[13:39	<Maligen>	kyja: thank you for help, I go and try to do something :D, bye
[13:39	<kyja>	Maligen, you could try to look at iwconfig in terminal to see what frequency it is set on.
[13:39	<seamus7>	abcde_: if it's a new bug then it isn't fixed yet ... I was using Azureus perfectly until a couple days ago when I switched to Deluge
[13:39	<kyja>	k later
[13:39	<fiXXXerMe1>	Repos are still bogged down?
[13:39]  * IdleOne is out. have a good day folks Happy first day after release day :)
[13:39	<Reuben>	IdleOne: did that :( i was spamming Esc really fast...could be caues it's a USB keyboard but i had enabled legacy usb support. IdleOne: i'm on a separate computer so it should be ok
[13:39	<livingdaylight>	osfameron, jew see for me de location of firefox is in Applicaition>Intetnet... but ocfourso that is not the path gmail checker wanted
[13:39	<Reuben>	IdleOne: nuuuu
[13:40	<Maligen>	kyja: hm..yes but I don't know what frequency is good for me
[13:40	<getBoa>	Hi yAll, i wanna see the all packages installed by apt-get...where's that log file ??
[13:40	<INTit>	Hey all im abit worried, im downloading the Gutsy gibbon update now i hears special effects is on by default, in my current version enabling special effects crashed my laptop
[13:40	<Prophezy>	anyone know how to install Compiz on Kubuntu?
[13:40	<abcde_>	seamus7, Does deluge have an IP-range auto-blocker?
[13:40	<INTit>	is gutsy gibbon going to do the same ?
[13:40	<Maligen>	kyja: fuxk
[13:40	<Maligen>	kyja: sorry...erm
[13:40	<mjkrto_co_cr_>	hi
[13:40	<kyja>	Maligen, well they should auto negotiate with one another to match frequencies but if they are not then that can be trouble
[13:40	<seamus7>	one person thinks he has a solution and a patch here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/azureus/+bug/57875/comments/108
[13:40	<livingdaylight>	dis is an area Linux can still become more friendly. When asked if want to open with another application there is no easy way to navigate to Applications and pick client from menu list...
[13:40	<Maligen>	kyja I just noticed that my WEP is active :S
[13:40	<jrib>	INTit: they should only be enabled if your hardware supports it I believe
[13:40	<nightswim>	:S:S
[13:41	<robj232323>	somewhat new to ubuntu-- are there any cool apps out there besides desktop managers?

[13:41	<livingdaylight>	and we don't all know where and what usr/bin/share/locale etc an application is always, si? no?
[13:41	<seamus7>	robj232323: what kind of apps?
[13:41	<pdlnhrd>	if i plug in a firewire drive?  how can i find out what its path is?
[13:42	<robj232323>	anything easier to use than xtraceroute? for starters
[13:42	<Nomikos>	pdlnhrd: I *think* it might turn up in /media
[13:42	<seamus7>	pdlnhrd: wouldn't that automatically mount in /media/ or /dev/ or maybe even /mnt/ ... check there.
[13:42	<pdlnhrd>	Nomikos: no such luck :(
[13:42	<Nomikos>	But I just hosed the install so can't check X-/

[13:44	<Odd-rationale>	Baikonur: lol Why is that?

[13:44	<Prophezy>	Laptop  6 month
[13:44	<Nomikos>	robj232323: there are many online tutorials on any language you want :-)
[13:44	<Neodudeman>	Prophezy: is it a toshiba?
[13:44	<livingdaylight>	jrib, i don't understand "you should have a list of applications"? After an application has been selected from 'other' yes it will be there in future but not the first time. First time one has to know ones way around the tree
[13:44	<Nomikos>	robj232323: try http://diveintopython.org/
[13:44	<livingdaylight>	i mean filesystem
[13:44	<jrib>	livingdaylight: nope
[13:45	<Prophezy>	Neodudeman : no its Fujitsu siemens
[13:45	<Baikonur>	Odd-rationale: it's just a short for COMpiz and Fusion, somehow the m has turned into n :)
[13:45	<robj232323>	that's what i'm talking about.. thanks for some tips besides running 40 desktops
[13:45	<robj232323>	!!
[13:45	<livingdaylight>	jrib, with configuring gmail checker this was also a different but equally good example... how a newbie shuld know /usr/bin/firefox
[13:45	<Odd-rationale>	Baikonur: ok. I thought it was giving trouble or something.
[13:45	<Neodudeman>	Prophezy: Try cleaning out the cooling fan. I know that I just cleaned out my laptop's cooling fan, and it never shuts off anymore.
[13:45	<abcde_>	seamus7, I did what he said, and I still have an issue, it works until I add a torrent
[13:46	<Nomikos>	robj232323: also, there should be a package manager somewhere in the administration menu where you can install/search for other software
[13:46	<abcde_>	seamus7, if Deluge has an iprange blocker, I'd use it

Do most just use tcp and I should know that

[14:04	<phpusmo>	anyone know how to fix the problem?
[14:04	<Reuben>	Vlet: yeah i somehow thought it would create a new partition from the freed space. so i didn't know the 'new partition' was actually the old partition resized

[14:06	<phpusmo>	http://pastebin.com/m2a7637c8 does anyone know how to fix that problem?
[14:06	<Vlet>	Reuben: It would have done that if you selected 'manual', but when the option you pick up top says, "Resize IDE1 master partition and use freed space", it's going to do what you said... resize the master partition
[14:06	<fliegenderfrosch>	if i use (manual) encrypted installation in gutsy, is it correct, that i create a /boot partition and an "encrypted" partition with the rest, then create a lvm-partition inside the encrypted partition and then create a / and a /home partition inside the lvm?
[14:06	<xep17>	gmailfs allows to mount the gmail account as a hard disk
[14:06	<Vlet>	Reuben: I wouldn't know how to repair windows at this point... you may just want to reinstall it, then install gutsy
[14:06	<Mithsir>	Hi! Firefox (Gutsy) crashes when I try to uncollapse the "browse" part in a "save" dialog. What can I do?
[14:06	<p34ce>	wat are the improvements from 5.10 to 7.10
[14:06	<xep17>	but by this way, is it possible to see the file that contains the mail ?
[14:06	<Nomikos>	Mithsir: report it to bugzilla, for one :)
[14:07	<Reuben>	Vlet: okie never mind it's all past now. but right now I did guided as per default settings. gparted shows everything right with /dev/sda1 as ntfs /dev/sda2 as ext3 and set as boot. and then /dev/sda3 extended with the swap in /dev/sda5
[14:07	<Neodudeman>	Vlet: Uh. So I googled, and the google didn't know about my ATI Mobility 7000.
[14:07	<Reuben>	Vlet: yeah i did that a clean install :P but it still mucked up :(

[14:07	<Nomikos>	Mithsir: you can also search the bugzilla reported bugs though, see if others have it
[14:08	<jrib>	cwkaya: best to just ask the channel your next question and see if anyone knows the answer
[14:08	<Vlet>	Reuben: Not really :/
[14:08	<Fant>	the gutsy upgrade makes me a sad panda .... 4 machine = 2 bricks, 1 mess, 1 fine

[14:08	<seamus7>	abcde_: not by any of the default plugins I know of ... azureus was good for those sorts of micro managing plugins

[14:12	<kbrosnan>	Mithsir: the next thing would be to back up your ~/.mozilla and do a full removal of firefox and reinstall via synaptic
[14:12	<Neodudeman>	jotil: lol. yarly
[14:12	<seamus7>	JuJubee: have you tried restarting the network by doing in a terminal: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[14:12	<Bo^Dick>	why cant i change resolution?
[14:12	<JuJuBee>	seamus7 : no, after I change the settings, if I check them ifconfig eth0, they have reverted back to previous settings.  When I re-launch system settings to check same there, they go back...
[14:12	<JuJuBee>	Yes
[14:13	<jotil>	Reuben: what do you need to do exactly?
[14:13	<Vlet>	jotil: It's an EVGA NVidia 8600 GT... I installed gutsy, the 'new restricted drivers are available' thing came up, clicked it, enabled it, restarted, and it's perfect
[14:13	<genii>	JuJuBee: I ask if eth0 is also internet because if the computer is doing the ISP login, it will revert any settings you make to whatever the pppoe login gets from server (usually pppoe, can be other types)
[14:13	<JuJuBee>	In fact, when I open the interface and change the IP, click save and it reloads the network settings, it changes back before my eyes...
[14:13	<Symmetria>	hrm, no gutsy-commercial repo?
[14:13	<genii>	JuJuBee: You had left #kubuntu so i replied in this channel instead

[14:14	<seamus7>	JuJuBee: have you tried disconnecting from the internet ... changing the system settings .. then reenabling the internet connection? .. sometimes a reset helps in that way
[14:14	<JuJuBee>	Not using pppoe, I am connected to a lan .
[14:14	<Vlet>	jotil: oh, althgouh the nvidia-settings app is incompatible with nvidia-glx-new, so you can't use it. Had to set up dual monitors manually in xorg

[14:41	<seamus7>	rflmnz: do this in a terminal: sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl
[14:41	<seamus7>	rflmnz: yes
[14:41	<downhillgames>	nightswim; then submit a report to make it the default :)
[14:41	<mycroftiv>	I'm working on installing Gutsy, but Ubiquity installer is crashing consistently during the setup process. my hardware runs dapper, edgy, and feisty well, and I have md5sum and verified the live CD. Any suggestions? I'm thinking of trying the alternate install CD.
[14:41	<Fant>	since 710 upgrade screwed up my ability in grub to boot the 704 kernel ... is there a way to add the 704 on to the menu ?
[14:41	<nightswim>	I tried, but something else (context menu or something) keeps popping up if I alt-right click downhillgames :)

[15:01	<aaro1>	haz: Then find the line in your xorg.conf that says something like "Horizsync" and "Vertrefresh"
[15:01	<jotil>	Reuben: just comment out the map commands.
[15:01	<flick>	Reuben, i can send you mine if you want

[15:02	<jotil>	Reuben: not really. you can see that it just maps on device to another and back. i didn't feel the need for it. experts may feel differently though. i wouldn't know. i have commented out my map lines and it works fine for me.
[15:02	<genii>	fuzzy: Ah, when dpkg-reconfigure command - was it   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver.xorg   or was it missing the -phigh part?

[15:05	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, ty will try that
[15:05	<MasterShrek>	anandanbu, could have to do with the 256mb of ram, you may need the alternate install which uses at text based installer

[15:05	<mc44>	Fant: why are you running the 7.10 kernel and nothing else from 7.10?
[15:05	<genii>	fuzzy: OK. Re-run the command without -phigh one more time. then when it asks about your mouse device put /dev/psaux if it's a ps2 mouse or /dev/ttyS0 if it's a serial mouse or the recommended one if it's a usb

[15:13	<Vlet>	PMantis: seeding at 1.3M/sec :)
[15:13	<redheat>	click on it, but it tells me
[15:13	<rflmnz>	but i'd uninstalled it.. Yes.. I did
[15:13	<PMantis>	The DVD torrent needs more seeders!  http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/current/gutsy-dvd-i386.iso.torrent
[15:13	<CroX>	MasterShrek: Does that mean It's XKB relateD? Because XKB throws a fIt..
[15:13	<MasterShrek>	CroX, try creating a new user and see if they have the same problems when the log in
[15:13	<abcde_>	Where can I find a CD Label for Gutsy?  I found one for Feisty, but not Gutsy.
[15:13	<adante>	i have installed the source package - but as i don't have the kernel config, is it ok for me to build against a different config, and just compile and install the modules?
[15:13	<profanephobia>	FFighter, and make sure the permissions are set correctly in /media/windows
[15:13	<kuro>	Does anyone know how to make macros within the terminal?
[15:13	<adante>	or will this turf my existing modules/kernel config setup
[15:13	<redheat>	that I'm connected through my, previously used, ethernet cable
[15:13	<kuro>	I need some help please.
[15:13	<FFighter>	profanephobia, I'm curious on why this happened
[15:13	<MasterShrek>	kuro, what do u mean a macro? keystroke?
[15:13	<train>	kuro: ask your question
[15:13	<hydrogen>	kuro: how in depth of a macro?
[15:14	<redheat>	I should just click on it and then try to figure my way from there?
[15:14	<CroX>	MasterShrek: AlrIght!
[15:14	<SympleSymon>	can anyone tell me how to get bloomberg tv/radio on 7.10. it's a windows media thang
[15:14	<profanephobia>	FFighter, me too... after you save fstab do sudo mount -a

[15:14	<profanephobia>	FFighter, hopefully it will mount
[15:14	<CapaH>	Question, after installing Gutsy Gibbon I want to use emerald themes, but apt-get install emerald-themes returns "Package emerald-themes is not available" ?

[15:14	<seamus7>	rflmnz: sudo apt-get remove envy
[15:14	<MasterShrek>	CapaH, install emerald-theme-manager and download themes from gnome-look.org
[15:14	<kuro>	mastershrek, terminal scripes or macro.  like i input an website URL into the terminal, and it should send me tot he website within the opera if i have a macro/scripe
[15:15	<FFighter>	profanephobia, nops, but it showed some helpful messages
[15:15	<FFighter>	profanephobia, is there a bin somewhere?
[15:15	<hydrogen>	so what you really want is a semantic terminal..
[15:15	<CapaH>	"Couldn't find package emerald-theme manager"
[15:15	<hydrogen>	sorry, we've got none of those!
[15:15	<MasterShrek>	kuro, put the word opera before it and it should work, if it doesnt enclose the web address in quotes
[15:15	<rflmnz>	seamus7: I've removed it preveously...
[15:15	<hydrogen>	opera -newpage 'url'
[15:16	<harm>	how can i resize my windows partition so i can increase my linux partition?
[15:16	<Fant>	jrib:  well this is annoying, the usb key will not mount even if i specify the fs type

[15:17	<hydrogen>	kuro: yes
[15:17	<Bo^Dick>	Pici: are you back?
[15:17	<mc44>	Fant: what exactly is the problem with your upgrade?
[15:17	<MasterShrek>	CroX, then you need to delete something in your old users configuration, i dont know what though...
[15:18	<CapaH>	Also, it appears that even when I have "emerald" running, the themes do not seem to be applying to the windows themselves
[15:18	<rflmnz>	seamus7: NF410 Mobo, AMD 3700+ and Ati x1300

[15:18	<Poul|Raider>	after i upgraded to 7.10 in update manager, the grafic settings are gone and keyboard settings not what they normal where. IS there a easy way to get back to how it was before? just install the nvidia driver again?

[15:18	<MasterShrek>	kuro, just put opera before the web address

[15:18	<MasterShrek>	CroX, no idea what file to change/remove
[15:18	<gordboy>	harm: gparted/qtparted are unreliable *at best*. just pray it hasn't started an operation without asking first ...
[15:18	<kuro>	hydrogen, is there a website i can find command lines for opera?  or is there a basic outline for all interweb browser?
[15:18	<mc44>	Fant: have you tried reconfiguring X?

[15:18	<Zambezi>	Anyone with Feisty and a dualcore CPU?
[15:18	<kuro>	hydrogen, thank you so much :)
[15:19	<Fant>	mc44:  its nvidia, and yes i have installed the nvidia driver, but still no working.
[15:19	<gordboy>	tru_`z24: i managed it ok
[15:19	<tru_`z24>	rgr
[15:19	<MasterShrek>	Zambezi, used to be, why?
[15:19	<jze>	hey.. should my wlan usb dongle appear as wlan0 instead of eth2 ??
[15:19	<profanephobia>	FFighter, sry i was away

[15:19	<hammer123>	hi, can someone tell me how to set the power management "put display to sleep when inactive for" lowwer than 11minutes?
[15:19	<Hulug_737>	I've upgraded and now my PC is crashing. The last thing I can read is 'starting gnome display manager'. Also the recovery boot options do this. How can I get into a console?
[15:19	<jrib>	Fant: I have to go in a bit, but assume you have main, restricted, universe and multiverse pointing at gutsy.  Just apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade, if no errors, then you are on gutsy.  You can run apt-get install -f to try to resolve broken packages.  dpkg --configure -a to check for packages not configured
[15:19	<seamus7>	rflmnz: my next suggestion would be to find someone more advanced than I am to help you ... perhaps try the #compiz channel
[15:19	<flick>	if i want to remove the original bittorrent client it says it has to remove ubuntu-desktop... is that okay? same thing with evolution too
[15:19	<Fant>	mc44:  yes thats why i am doing now
[15:19	<Zambezi>	MasterShrek: I would like to know how much better the CPU is then mine on a ten seconds stresstest in stress.
[15:19	<Veinor>	jze: my wireless card usually appears as eth1, but it doesn't make a huge difference.
[15:19	<Gigi>	Hi there!!!  Just a couple of things!!!  1st:  I've been using ubuntu since 6.04!   Congratulations on the 7.10!  It has improve a lot!!!!!!!!!!!
[15:19	<Vlet>	Keel: yes
[15:19	<MasterShrek>	Hulug_737, you need to reinstall your video driver
[15:19	<Zambezi>	MasterShrek: It'
[15:20	<kuro>	when did 7.10 stable come out?  was it yesterday?
[15:20	<profanephobia>	FFighter, before you exited windows did you properly shut down?
[15:20	<jotil>	ah
[15:20	<rflmnz>	ok.. Thanks!
[15:20	<Zambezi>	MasterShrek: It's not found in GG repo, so I need Feisty.
[15:20	<gordboy>	kuro: yes. 18th october
[15:20	<Hulug_737>	Shrek: I can't do anything. It crashes. I can't get into a console.
[15:20	<profanephobia>	FFighter, or did you hard boot or hibernate?
[15:20	<ZaphodBeeblebro1>	Ok, guys, I'm giving up on this, I'll make a clean install of Gutsy (already have the ISO), so I have basically two questions: 1) If for some reason I decide to make a clean install of Feisty over this (upgraded-Gutsy), will I have problems? 2) Will the clean install of Gutsy automatically recognize my home various "settings folders" (e.g. Thunderbird, Pidgin, etc)

[15:20	<flozza06>	hey! i've got a question: is there an audio player (preferably with an interface similar to rhythmbox or maybe even a plugin for rhythmbox) that lets me choose the audio output device? i've got a c-media usb headset and normal speakers. so i'd like to be able to easily switch the output device. i know that amarok has got such a function, but i simply don't like it's interface
[15:20	<seamus7>	rflmnz: if you are unable to get help in a timely fashion... you may have to resort to reinstalling gutsy
[15:20	<jotil>	i like desktops better. pity for people who only use laptops.
[15:20	<Fant>	jrib: yeah thanks for your help, i tryed all those already
[15:20	<jze>	ok.. Im just having problems with it.. It won't connect to my wireless network.. i've tried to set up the connection manually and with nm-applet but neither has worked..
[15:20	<gordboy>	kuro: tho "stable" is a bit of a misnomer. dolphin has unresolved errors, as does kdelibs

[15:21	<Ryuho>	...go to settings.
[15:21	<kuro>	gordboy, i had had some big problems with 7.04 stable version anyways.  I couldn't open any music files, or video files, or video games.  So, this new version will either be better or worse for me
[15:22	<Vlet>	Keef_: sure... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41197/
[15:22	<mc44>	ZaphodBeeblebro1: then it should pick up settings

[15:22	<Vlet>	jotil: yes
[15:22	<seamus7>	pwnt- do you use rsync?
[15:22	<MasterShrek>	oh, well Zambezi the fact that a cpu is dual core doesnt affect how fast it is, it just affects how fast it is when multiple things are running
[15:22	<Keef_>	Vlet: thanks!
[15:22	<Fant>	mc44 or jrib:  would you mind pastebin your sources.list so i can confirm mine is correct ?
[15:22	<Vlet>	Keef_: good luck

[15:23	<flick>	hmm
[15:23	<Ryuho>	yaaaay distro update.. i've been doing it for... 7hs now
[15:23	<genii>	hubuntu: If you usae ctrl-alt-f2 that will just swap you to a console, X is still running. if you do that go back with alt-f7
[15:23	<erUSUL>	flick: that means in 6 months so writte it down somewhere ;)
[15:23	<CroX>	MasterShrek: Thanks man! Your question about Compiz made me remember it's fscked up macros and when I looked, I had a .compiz directory in my home. I deleted that, restarted X and voila! It worked. :)

[15:23	<geefinator>	Hulug_737:  Whats the question?
[15:24	<seamus7>	pwnt- rsync is a powerful command for backing up and extremely simple ... it will check for updates to files and only copy the difference .. makes it faster . for instance in a terminal I do ... rsync -av "/home/username" "/media/externaldrive/archive"
[15:24	<kuro>	so, how is the new version of ubuntu?  i haven't yet upgrade yet.  anything noticely different?
[15:24	<Vlet>	jotil: yep :/
[15:24	<MasterShrek>	cool CroX, glad to hear it
[15:24	<gordboy>	kuro: it says categorically on the ubuntu website that most music/video formats are proprietary. all you need to do is enable the medibuntu repository. if all this is greek to you, go back to windows. it's funny how demandinmg people get of FREE software. especially children and teenagers who haven't been fleeced their entire adult life for crappy commercial software </rant>

[15:24	<Hulug_737>	Both boot options crash the system and last thing I can read is starting gnome display manager.

[15:24	<Fant>	mc44:  yes ours are identical except mine is us and yours is gb
[15:24	<erUSUL>	flick: you can upgrade but not dist-upgrade (e.g. feisty-->gutsy)
[15:24	<jotil>	Vlet: that's odd! :P
[15:24	<geefinator>	Kuro:  The only thing I noticed was it broke my dual monitor, had to go back to feisty.
[15:24	<ebirtaid>	fn'Hulug_737: how does it crash?  it jst freezes?
[15:24	<jotil>	Vlet: tried: emerald --replace ?
[15:24	<mc44>	Fant: main and restricted are in there ok?
[15:25	<Vlet>	jotil: oh, it just took a relog to get it working after installing emerald... bug duhhh for me :)
[15:25	<Fant>	mc44: yes
[15:25	<mc44>	Fant: so nv won't boot into x either?
[15:25	<Hulug_737>	Display stops to receive signal and alt+ctrl+f? doesn't work.
[15:25	<kuro>	geefinator, don't say that. i also have dual display :(
[15:25	<jotil>	Vlet: hehe. cool.
[15:25	<profanephobia>	geefinator, did you try using the gusty dual monitor gui?
[15:25	<ZaphodBeeblebro1>	ok. guys: Thanks a lot, mc44, jotil for all the effort (the others aren't here now) Hope to enter here soon and say "Everything works! I love Gutsy!"
[15:25	<genii>	Hulug_737: Are you using an intel915/945 type video?
[15:25	<flick>	ahh... probably then i will keep it installed
[15:25	<geefinator>	profanephobia:   Hah, that thing is a joke.
[15:25	<Bo^Dick>	jotil: thanks
[15:25	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebro1: did it work?
[15:25	<profanephobia>	geefinator, it worked for me
[15:25	<Hulug_737>	It's a ati adaptor.,
[15:25	<BusMaster>	i just installed 64 bit Gutsy on my AMD64. I can't find the tapioca package which I use for voice chatting on GoogleTalk. Is there another way to be able to use Gtalk?
[15:26	<flick>	and remove it after i dist-upgrade to the next version which comes with LTS
[15:26	<Ryuho>	hubuntu does it get to the login screen?
[15:26	<Fant>	mc44:  well either the gutsy nv driver or the nvidia one will boot into x, but only the background loads. you can tell that gnome-panel is attempting to load because it flashes at the bottom a few times and then you are stuck on the background picture.  you cant bring up anything at that point
[15:26	<geefinator>	kuro:  you might be able to get it to work, but with my shitty ati vid card all i could get was clone.
[15:26	<jotil>	ZaphodBeeblebro1: i got mine to work though. same card. GeForce 6200.
[15:26	<geefinator>	profanephobia:  Well I am glad it worked for someone.
[15:26	<pwnt->	seamus7: but I wonder why that error keep happening for me
[15:26	<Hulug_737>	I simply need some way to get into a console.
[15:26	<ZaphodBeeblebro1>	jotil: It didn't
[15:26	<gordboy>	ZaphodBeeblebro1: i had my system fully operational yesterday. it more or less does work nicely first-time. just a couple of glitches, which should be sorted out soon
[15:26	<mc44>	Fant: ah so it's not a driver problem
[15:26	<jotil>	Bo^Dick: welcome
[15:26	<ZaphodBeeblebro1>	jotil: I'll maje a clean one
[15:26	<kuro>	gordboy, im sorry i missed that, because im using java at school right now.  i did install the codecs and everything i needed to play it.  it use to work for over 7 months and one day it just stop working.  everytime i try to open a file, the whole system freezes
[15:26	<Hulug_737>	It crashes on loading gnome.
[15:26	<profanephobia>	geefinator, maybe itll get better :)

[15:27	<genii>	Hulug_737: I'm asking about i915/945 video becase: ctrl-alt-f1 actually does work, except it just gives what looks like the gdm/kdm screen. but it actually responds to text typed in even tho you cannot see it.
[15:27	<Vlet>	kuro: haha
[15:27	<pwnt->	geefinator: use tar? explain more please

[15:28	<kuro>	vlet, sigh.  ha
[15:28	<seamus7>	pwnt- I don't know .. symbolic links and wine and using the cp command can be tricky ... rsync will handle that for you appropriately .. unlike just using cp
[15:28	<profanephobia>	FFighter, did you ge tit?
[15:28	<jotil>	Vlet: that's why i use metacity. customize it to my own liking. i am thinking of making an iconset from icons i collected interfacelift.com
[15:28	<profanephobia>	FFighter, s/ge tit/ get it
[15:28	<geefinator>	pwnt-:  Tar is the backup/archive tool for the command line.  do a man tar in the terminal and read up.  It is one of the nicest things about linux in my book.
[15:28	<pwnt->	seamus7: Thanks brother:) Usng rsync now

[15:29	<PMantis>	Poul|Raider: Make a backup first, but Yes... should be able to do that.
[15:29	<geefinator>	pwnt-:  uh yeah tar works on whole directories...
[15:29	<Hulug_737>	Is there anything I can do in grub to prevent gnome from loading?

[15:29	<kuro>	gordboy, are  you replying to me???? with that "quote" and if so.  all i could think of was an update or something.  i installed lineage 2 on my computer.  but i just copy the files from windows.  thats the biggest change i made within ubuntu to change anything around.  it just stop working one day.  i kid ya not.
[15:29	<pwnt->	geefinator: true. give me the command so i can make my whole /home/user in a tar archive:) I'm in a bit hurry can't read whole man please.
[15:29	<liquid-x>	Poul|Raider: dude, my xorg is fucked up too
[15:29	<jotil>	UbuntuGuy: perhaps due to server load? try changing repositories.
[15:29	<Ryuho>	Hulug_737 can you get to your login screen? or does it crash before that
[15:29	<Hulug_737>	It crashes.
[15:29	<aaro1>	haz: did that work for you?
[15:30	<aboutblank>	Hulug_737: it's called single user mode... let me find it

[15:30	<geefinator>	pwnt- tar czf directory,tar.gz /path/of/directory
[15:30	<Hulug_737>	With recovery option, it asks for root pswd and when pressing ctrl+d it crashes.
[15:30	<genii>	Hulug_737: Try booting to Recovery
[15:30	<SNy>	Interesting. The installation comes with a gcc, but fails to install libc-dev. Non-working compilers are fun. NOT.
[15:30	<Haz>	aaro1: does it just require a restart once done with editing, or is there like a rehash command?
[15:30	<Ryuho>	lol
[15:30	<Hulug_737>	I've tried the -b option in grub. But I'm not totally sure where to write it to pass it to init.
[15:30	<Xargo>	Anyone recognizes the problem where your wireless keyboard doesn't work at the login screen of Ubuntu?
[15:30	<mc44>	Fant: what does "apt-cache policy feisty-gdm-themes" say?
[15:30	<geefinator>	pwnt-:  you might want to and the v option so you can see what it is doing.
[15:30	<Hulug_737>	Recovery doesn't help. It still loads gnome and crashes.
[15:30	<pwnt->	seamus7: in the terminal now rsync is outputting alot of errors :(
[15:30	<Ryuho>	Hulug_737 maybe spam CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE while booting up?
[15:30	<aaro1>	haz: You need to log out and back in to reset X I think. Someone else correct me if I'm wrong
[15:31	<GNUtoo>	genii, if it says 0 upgraded 0 newly installed etc...is it that i'm already in gutsy gibon?

[15:43	<FFighter>	profanephobia, Actually I don't have Windows installed, I don't dual boot... this partition is a legacy thing that I used to backup files from my windows
[15:43	<arpeggi>	1 - i've just installed the latest nvidia drivers in the livecd so i can try compiz - its asking me to restart. will i lose this installation when i restart as i'm in the livecd?
[15:43	<hubuntu>	aaro1: definitely... I used it first as the gnome live CD (gnoppix...) based on warty I think, So I waited for Hoary 5.04 to come out and I swaped every other GNU/Linux I had (Fedora Core, Debian) in my machines and had installed in everything I find in my way since (servers, laptops, desktops)... Now I'm working on the community actively and It's just amazing what this sorceres of Canonical and the MOTUs manage to thrill... Go (u)buntu!
[15:43	<Fant>	mc44:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41198
[15:43	<Sun_Paladin>	Vlet: and if I want to get some documents off of Ubuntu, how do I do that? I ran recovery mode and it said that I had to run dpkg or something manually
[15:43	<eolo999>	hi someone can shout me to test irssi libnotify script
[15:43	<profanephobia>	FFighter, oh! ok well then open fstab
[15:43	<fyrestrtr>	arpeggi: you cannot install drivers on the livecd.
[15:43	<arpeggi>	damn
[15:43	<kl4m>	!samba
[15:43	<Ubotwo>	samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[15:43	<arpeggi>	so i cant test compiz
[15:43	<MasterShrek>	anyone know why adept would be wanting me to do a version upgrade when im already running 7.10?
[15:43	<parsek_77>	i need help for NVIDIA
[15:44	<WorkingOnWise>	when I drag and drop folders in nautilus to move and copy, are all links and permissions preserved, for both move and copy?
[15:44	<aboutblank>	eolo999:
[15:44	<arpeggi>	dw i'm still going to set it up later as a partition
[15:44	<FFighter>	profanephobia, ok
[15:44	<Shapeshifter->	genii: DPMS is enabled
[15:44	<Shapeshifter->	jxxt: I need it on.
[15:44	<fyrestrtr>	arpeggi: no, you can get another livecd that already has compiz setup.
[15:44	<MasterShrek>	WorkingOnWise, yes
[15:44	<eolo999>	thanks aboutblank it works!
[15:44	<arpeggi>	question 2: does anyone know why my text wiggles in the pidgin window when i'm typing?
[15:44	<dwxreaper>	how do I get just the initialization scripts from a package
[15:44	<profanephobia>	FFighter, one sec
[15:44	<bobbo>	MasterShrek: does it give you a list of packages it wants to upgrade?
[15:44	<eolo999>	it's wonderful!
[15:44	<eolo999>	eolo999:
[15:44	<WorkingOnWise>	MasterShrek: you see ma as WorkingOnWise?
[15:44	<numus>	what is the hotkey to open the run line.. i totally forgot..
[15:44	<Vlet>	Sun_Paladin: oh, boot off the live cd (installer cd) and before you actually run the installer, you should be able to access your old ubuntu partition and copy things over to a thumb drive or whatever
[15:44	<XsteelWolf>	How do i install language support for wine windows applications
[15:44	<WorkingOnWise>	ma=me
[15:44	<hubuntu>	BRB after fixing the apartment :)
[15:44	<fyrestrtr>	XsteelWolf: #winehq
[15:45	<profanephobia>	FFighter, and once more replace that line with "/dev/hda5 /media/windows ntfs-3g defaults,force 0 0"
[15:45	<genii>	harm: For that you will need 2 mount commands. One to mount the device (after you discover the proper one), then you will need to bind-mount the subdir that device to the Documents dir
[15:45]  * Symmetria hopes this keeps working, to fix the load on my ubuntu mirror server, I nfs mounted the ubuntu-archive to another machine, and added another http daemon on that other machine that supports another 5k clients
[15:45	<eolo999>	aboutblank: can you do it again while win is not focused...go!

[15:45	<Vlet>	woot - seeding the DVD at 6.2 Megs a second :)
[15:45	<arpeggi>	can i set up a partition from this installation?
[15:45	<yeager>	XsteelWolf: wine's own applications or windows applications?
[15:45	<mc44>	Fant: ldd /usr/bin/gnome-panel
[15:45	<profanephobia>	FFighter, once saved do sudo mount -a
[15:45	<numus>	the 7.10 upgrader wont download.. any way to force a download or delete whatever is cached so it tries to download a fresh version?
[15:45	<harm>	genii: well atm my windows partii is mounted in /media/sda1 can i create a symbolic link to the MyDoc folders or something?
[15:45	<arpeggi>	and how can i view my windows installation in livecd?
[15:45	<Noiano>	jotil, thanks
[15:45	<fyrestrtr>	arpeggi: yes.
[15:45	<jimmacdonald>	since the update to gutsy my desktop machine won't network automatically. I have to set it to local zeroconf network and force a dhcp config. if I set the network type to dhcp it won't connect at all.
[15:45	<Sun_Paladin>	Vlet: are there instructions on how to boot off the live Cd? when I start up my computer it goes into the dual boot screen and then I'm allowed to choose an operating system. Is the cd supposed to kick in before that?
[15:45	<sisseck>	can anyone tell me how to set up firewall so it doesnt conflict with WoW updater. Running it through cedega
[15:45	<FFighter>	profanephobia, mounted!
[15:46	<WorkingOnWise>	MasterShrek: thanks.
[15:46	<fyrestrtr>	arpeggi: define 'view'
[15:46	<harm>	numus not sure but sudo apt-get clear or clean ?
[15:46	<profanephobia>	FFighter, sweet!
[15:46	<garu>	!gparted
[15:46	<Ubotwo>	GParted is is a !GUI partitioning program. Type « sudo apt-get install gparted » in a console to install it - A GParted "live" CD is available at http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[15:46	<FFighter>	profanephobia, I just wonder why this happened
[15:46	<FFighter>	profanephobia, why we had to force it
[15:46	<jotil>	Noiano: fyi, that was for 32bit systems. you can find the 64bit one in the same directory.
[15:46	<XsteelWolf>	yeager, im trying to run a windows chinese program using wine,it comes up with wierd characters
[15:46	<pwnt->	sisseck: I run wow with wine. so smooth:)
[15:46	<Fant>	mc44:  want the output ?
[15:46	<fyrestrtr>	sisseck: there is a faq for that on blizzard's forums.
[15:46	<genii>	harm: It is not a good idea to make Documents folder in linux a symlink.
[15:46	<numus>	not sure if clean did anything
[15:46	<profanephobia>	FFighter, not really sure
[15:46	<pike_>	sisseck: easiest way is to install firestarter to configure it. its nice and graphical but there shouldnt be any firewall rules setup by defula
[15:46	<mc44>	Fant: pastebin it yeah
[15:46	<harm>	genii: howcome?
[15:46	<tecywiz121>	question about sound:  My optical out only has two channels (L/R) while the all the headphone jacks work fine (alsa, audigy2 notebook)
[15:46	<Vlet>	Sun_Paladin: yeah, it should... you might have to adjust something in your bios. If the CD is in the drive, your computer should boot off it before it even tries to see what's on the hard drives
[15:46	<Noiano>	jotil, I have a 32bit system :)
[15:46	<numus>	the upgrader froze
[15:46	<Fant>	mc44:  41199
[15:46	<sisseck>	ok thanks all, i'll try the firestarter thing
[15:47	<harm>	genii: and no problems if symlink wont work but can i instead mount it then into my Documents folder?
[15:47	<arpeggi>	by view i mean just access my files in my vista installation from the livecd
[15:47	<Sun_Paladin>	Vlet: okay, I will try that. thanks very much for the help.
[15:47	<on>	question: my PS/2 keyboard is recognized in the CD startup menu, but I can not use it at all once ubuntu (7.1) is loaded. any idea?
[15:47	<yeager>	XsteelWolf: ok, sounds like there are issues with character encoding. try ask in #wine
[15:47	<genii>	harm: Various reasons. but imagine trying to open in filemanager a symlink which points to nenexistant device
[15:47	<harm>	genii: i just want quick access to my windowsMydocuments folder :)
[15:47	<Vlet>	Sun_Paladin: glad to :)

[15:48	<Ubotwo>	HourPastMidnight: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[15:49	<jxxt>	Hourpastmidnight, are you using update manager??
[15:49	<genii>	harm: Best way is make a subdir in the Documents. then mount the subdir of what contained My Documents in Windows into the linux Documents folder using the bind type of mount. This is for mounting one directory under another directory
[15:49	<mc44>	Fant: hmm some stuff is in /usr/local/lib which is odd.
[15:49	<arpeggi>	also how do it turn off the messages in this window telling me when people join and leave the channel?

[15:50	<mc44>	Fant: yeah, you must have installed some crap which is using different libraries
[15:50	<yeager>	hammer123: try a repo in another country
[15:50	<HourPastMidnight>	Pici: I read the upgrade notes. The instructions say the update manager will prompt me to do a dist upgrade, which it does not.
[15:50	<jxxt>	Hourpastmidnight, OK I just did a quick sudo apt-get update then I got the new release dialog :-)

[15:51	<GNUtoo>	does someone knows gnash or i810?
[15:51	<mc44>	Fant: try removing cedega
[15:51	<genii>	dystopianray: Replacing the Documents folder with a symlink to the old windows My Documents is really not a great idea, which is what he's attempting
[15:51	<mc44>	Fant: --purge it
[15:51	<fyrestrtr>	jimmacdonald: how do you connect to the network?
[15:51	<seamus7>	Any Ubuntu Experts know this one ... rsync is giving "operation not permitted" errors on attempts to backup a home directory ... what would likely be causing this?
[15:51	<Shapeshifter->	I configured my lap top screen to turn off if I close the lid. The problem is that it turns on again if I accidentally move the mouse. Is there a way to fix this or cut off mouse input when the lid is closed? It would actually be ideal if the USB port where the mouse is connected would be disabled on closing the lid (so that the mouse is turned off completely)

[15:52	<bitraiser>	when I upgrade to Gutsy through the UPGRADE button, will it automatically upgrade everything that I have now with the kernel and stuff and yet I get to keep all my current themes and settings?
[15:52	<ny00123>	Hi...any case the following is a bug?
[15:52	<Vlet>	hammer123: In the 'Software Sources' administrative control panel, there is an option 'Download From'... select other, and then there is a button called 'Select best Server'
[15:52	<fyrestrtr>	jimmacdonald: are you using network manager or manual configuration?
[15:52	<jxxt>	Hourpastmidnight, Did you do update??
[15:52	<mrj>	bitraiser, theoretically
[15:52	<ny00123>	If in 64-bit Ubuntu you try:
[15:52	<ny00123>	sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture skype-debian_1.4.0.118-1_i386.deb
[15:52	<genii>	dystopianray: Ah, yeah for what he needs would be fine
[15:52	<mc44>	Fant: yep :) probably some things are using the cedega libraries for gutsy and they won't have been updgraded because its from third party
[15:52	<seamus7>	fyrestrtr: yes but it's my home directory .. why would those errors come in .. sudo was tried as well and with the same error results
[15:52	<mrj>	bitraiser, notice I dont say "yes"
[15:52	<ny00123>	and then it gets installed, it doesn't appear in the package list
[15:52	<ny00123>	so you can't remove it at all
[15:52	<harm>	genii: urm so would ln /media/sda1/test ~/test work?
[15:52	<mc44>	Fant: for feisty I mean
[15:52	<jotil>	Noiano: i am not sure where else i can find the md5sum because the cdimage.ubuntu.com seems to be down. however, torrents themselves have a way of checking the file integrity i believe.
[15:52	<ny00123>	(sudo apt-get remove skype fails)
[15:52	<jimmacdonald>	attempting to use network manager but I have to configure manuall to make it work.
[15:53	<fyrestrtr>	seamus7: where are you rsync'ing to?
[15:53	<bitraiser>	mrj, ok, so I should try to back up my stuff first then I suppose and then attempt that UPGRADE thing huh?
[15:53	<aboutblank>	ny00123: No, because you didn't install it with apt. do "sudo dpkg -r skype"
[15:53	<poe>	is anyone able to help me with my problem? about the caps-lock blinking freeze :P
[15:53	<ny00123>	ah
[15:53	<Fant>	mc44:  cant i just reinstall cedega and it will fix its libs ?>
[15:53	<mrj>	bitraiser, that'd be logical
[15:53	<jimmacdonald>	interestingly enough... email or browser doesn't work but I am talking to you just fine on the same machine
[15:53	<ny00123>	I've thought dpkg and apt share stuff
[15:53	<dystopianray>	poe: your system freezes and caps lock blinks?
[15:53	<poe>	yep
[15:53	<fyrestrtr>	jimmacdonald: disable network manager, set up the network for dhcp in /etc/network/interfaces, restart networking with /etc/init.d/networking restart and see if you get a dhcp address.
[15:53	<hammer123>	what is the command to upgrade to 7.10?
[15:53	<ny00123>	like, apt uses dpkg to install, and also to add to the package list
[15:53	<Pici>	!upgrade | hammer123

[15:53	<Ubotwo>	hammer123: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes

[15:55	<bitraiser>	mrj, how about if i download the alternate CD, and use that to upgrade...is it pretty much the same as if i did it through the internet with the Update Manager (and its upgrade button) ?  or is that something totally different really

[15:56	<profanephobia>	how can i repair my ubuntu boot screen?
[15:57	<seamus7>	fyrestrtr: does it need to be reformatted as ext3
[15:57	<harm>	murlidhar: utorrent is just the best client.. tried most other clients and utorrent just always manages to outperform
[15:57	<Vlet>	profanephobia: How did you break it?
[15:57	<fyrestrtr>	seamus7: no, you just need to mount it with proper permissions so that the user you are rsyncing as can write to it.

[15:58	<mvrd3rd011>	hi

[15:58	<bobbo>	which is the best backup script in the repos?
[15:58	<Vlet>	flick: it doesn't create the entire file... it expands it as it needs
[15:59	<flick>	Vlet, the size shows 42 GB
[15:59	<SANone>	damn.. I booted my notebook (7.10 only) this morning and I got this @#*&!* error 17 from grub... common error?
[15:59	<flick>	Vlet, i hope there's nothing to worry?
[15:59	<seamus7>	fyrestrtr: thx... one more question ... silly ... can't remember how to check the file system of the volume to be sure it's fat32 and not ext3
[15:59	<poe>	dystopianray: or if u mean when, in Gutsy: it happened once during booting, once when i was randomly browsing the web. In Feisty: it happened at random times frequently...
[15:59	<dystopianray>	flick: does the file contain anything or is a blank file?
[15:59	<fyrestrtr>	seamus7: mount will tell you
[15:59	<K3nt0>	can i boot the 7.10 live cd from USB or something?

[16:00	<fyrestrtr>	Zambezi: it has already been named
[16:00	<poe>	dystopianray: haven't tried others ... only 7.10 and 7.04 ubuntu
[16:00	<seamus7>	fyrestrtr: and what permission need to be set in order for it to be backup-able

[16:00	<poe>	dystopianray: nope, both gutsy and feisty have this thing
[16:00	<Fant>	mc44:  you think this is worth trying to fix ... or should i just reinstall ?
[16:00	<CapaH>	Hello, I cannot get SSH to work for some reason. Whenever I try to ssh me@localhost I just get "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host"
[16:00	<pike_>	arpeggi: just type it in here
[16:01	<mc44>	Fant: what did dpkg -S say?
[16:01	<mrj>	K3nt0, you want to "boot the livecd" from a "usb harddrive or anything not including burning a CD"...... I'm missing your logic here
[16:01	<fyrestrtr>	copyofjohan: yes, don't install ubuntu-desktop

[16:01	<maccam94>	i've upgraded a dell ubuntu inspiron 1420n from feisty to gutsy, but I've got serious issues getting the video card to work properly. I can't get it out of VESA. it's supposed to use the i810 driver, but the xorg.conf seems to be being ignored
[16:01	<copyofjohan>	fyrestrtr: is there a metapackage for pure-gnome?
[16:01	<aboutblank>	damn, the repos are really really slow.
[16:01	<CapaH>	dystopianray: For debugging purposes yes --- I am actually trying to connect to it from another machine, but that is not working either
[16:01	<seamus7>	fyrestrtr: it says the file system is vfat ... is that a problem?
[16:01	<arpeggi>	oh ignore isnt a command
[16:01	<MrKeuner>	fyrestrtr: delete which file?
[16:01	<K3nt0>	mrj i dont have any blank discs and i was wondering of any alternative to using the livecd
[16:01	<Shapeshifter->	I configured my lap top screen to turn off if I close the lid. The problem is that it turns on again if I accidentally move the mouse. Is there a way to fix this or cut off mouse input when the lid is closed? It would actually be ideal if the USB port where the mouse is connected would be disabled on closing the lid (so that the mouse is turned off completely)
[16:01	<bruenig>	MrKeuner, redownloading the file is nonsense, the error is with a script inside the package
[16:02	<dystopianray>	CapaH: are you running an ssh server?
[16:02	<CapaH>	yes
[16:02	<CapaH>	dystopianray: Default ubuntu installation
[16:02	<XsteelWolf>	By any chance does anyone knows how to install chinese fonts in wine?
[16:02	<mrj>	K3nt0, there are alternatives that allow you to INSTALL it without a CD
[16:02	<dystopianray>	CapaH: default ubuntu does not include an ssh server

[16:03	<dystopianray>	CapaH: hrrm I am not sure, but ubuntu shouldn't have an ssh server enabled by default
[16:03	<CapaH>	well, it does :)
[16:03	<Martinp23>	Is there a way to run the dist-upgrade using a local apt-mirror (where that mirror is only a gutsy mirror - no feisty packages)?

[16:03	<missmyso>	hi everybody
[16:03	<Vlet>	dystopianray: no, it doesn't
[16:03	<K3nt0>	what about installing ubuntu on a usb hdd
[16:03	<bruenig>	MrKeuner, yes, ubuntu continues to do stuff like this even after the bug reports I and others have filed, it is trying to stop a daemon before removing it and that fails
[16:03	<jotil>	i am not installing anything for the next few days. why won't people use torrents and get an alternate CD and upgrade from there? :'(
[16:03	<Vlet>	dystopianray: oh sorry, I thought you said it should :)
[16:03	<copyofjohan>	fyrestrtr: I worked it out: gnome-desktop-environment is the metapackage
[16:03	<CapaH>	dystopianray: openssh-server is already the newest version. openssh-server set to manual installed.
[16:03	<jxxt>	what is Ubotwo??
[16:04	<CapaH>	thats what I get when I try apt-get install openssh-server

[16:07	<missmyso>	how to install crystaleye in ubuntu 7.04?
[16:07	<rflmnz>	vlet: What experience do u have? :D
[16:07	<maccam94>	i've upgraded a dell ubuntu inspiron 1420n from feisty to gutsy, but I've got serious issues getting the video card to work properly. I can't get it out of VESA. it's supposed to use the i810 driver, but the xorg.conf seems to be being ignored. i get bulletproofX every time, so I  can't even debug it
[16:07	<bobbo>	flozza06: have you tried a different tagger like cowbell?
[16:07	<dystopianray>	CapaH: i'm not sure what would cause that
[16:07	<adante>	i want to build some modules for my kernel, can i do this without having to rebuild the whole kernel? (my kernel is binary from whatever 7.04 installed)
[16:07	<bruenig>	dwxreaper, just download the entire package and then extract it if you want to
[16:08	<genii>	Capah: sudo apt-get install --reinstall openssh-server;sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
[16:08	<giany911>	so ... any known issues when upgrading from feisty to gutsy, especially with easy ubuntu, envy ..nvidia drivers ?
[16:08	<Vlet>	rflmnz: I had one in my work computer until 2 days ago... an optiplex 745... the thing was okay, but I for the life of me could not get compiz working even though I've heard people say it could be done...
[16:08	<pwnt->	any updates happened since yesterday?
[16:08	<weltall>	does anyone remember that "window" which is shown when gnome is launching (there is a similar one on kde) which shows components being loaded? does anyone know how to restore it as it doesn't show anymore to me...?
[16:08	<dystopianray>	maccam94: with gutsy you should be using the 'intel' driver
[16:08	<Yshusnir>	does anybody know if there's a version of the 7.10 install CD that doesn't have this cd boot menu, but starts directly installing, like with 5.10 and olders ?
[16:08	<ima-n00b>	Yshusnir: alternate cds..
[16:08	<WaltzingAlong>	Yshusnir: yes it is the alternate cd (not desktop) or the DVD
[16:08	<genii>	CapaH: You can add -f switch to force it
[16:08	<Vlet>	rflmnz: with all the time you'll spend trying to get it working, you're better off spending that time working a job, taking the money you earn, and buy a $120 NVidia card :)
[16:08	<MrKeuner>	bruenig: that worked thank you
[16:08	<CapaH>	genii: What do you mean?
[16:08	<flozza06>	bobbo, no, but i will now :-)
[16:09	<giany911>	so ... any known issues when upgrading from feisty to gutsy, especially with easy ubuntu, envy ..nvidia drivers ?
[16:09	<Fant>	mc44:  lol back to black background
[16:09	<Yshusnir>	WaltzingAlong : they still have a boot menu, I tried :]
[16:09	<Fant>	mc44:  blank
[16:09	<maccam94>	dystopianray, it doesn't work with the intel driver either. the i810 driver is supposed to be more stable too, but i've been trying both and it seems like xorg.conf is just being ignored (or there's some problem forcing bulletproofX every time)
[16:09	<rickjones>	giany911 : gutsy doesn't like older ati cards.
[16:09	<Vlet>	rflmnz: It worked great in 2D though with two 1680x1050 monitors
[16:09	<arpeggi>	gstreamer
[16:09	<TabooTreez>	Can someone help me. Im using gusty. But I still cant get mt ntfs drive to mount. Its very odd.
[16:09	<Vlet>	missmyso: what is crystal eye?
[16:10	<WaltzingAlong>	Yshusnir: what do you mean still have a boot menu? well you can pass some parameters to the kernel if you need such as setting resolution and turning off acpi
[16:10	<jxxt>	gstreamer
[16:10	<giany911>	rickjones anything else? got an nvidia so i'm off the hook
[16:10	<genii>	Bah not -f ... --force-yes
[16:10	<SANone>	TabooTreez: Install ntfs-config
[16:10	<Yshusnir>	it's the very first menu, when you choose to "install in text mode", "install for server", and stuffs. my computer reboots when i choose any option
[16:10	<jxxt>	!gstreamer
[16:10	<rickjones>	i'm noticed the i386 runs GREAT with kde, all in all i haven't any complaints
[16:10	<TabooTreez>	SANone: im on gusty so its installed by default. Just doesnt want to mount.
[16:10	<genii>	CapaH: the --reinstall part will overwrite whatever manual entries were misconfigured in it's conf files with stock ones

[16:27	<tsukasa>	MickoD, if it can see it, then you might want to try reformatting the partition your going to use for linux (eg sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/xxx1)
[16:27	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, try creating a new user and see if they can log in, im pretty sure its some config files somewhere in your users directory

[16:32	<joseaa>	Hello, Appearance preference dialog is taking 100% CPU in gutsy. Is it a bug ?
[16:32	<Greencookie>	Someone please help me with GUTSY install. All I get is "OUT OF RANGE" in red on my monitor :(
[16:32	<rflmnz>	I HATE ATI X1300! Sorry for the caps!
[16:33	<johnh>	this is the lines for the disks that i don't know
[16:33	<SNy>	Man, I am totally fed up with this crap. This combination of g550 and monitor has been working fine with debian before. The version of xorg and the mga driver do not allow me to use the native resolution on this gutsy install now.
[16:33	<danielbw>	ubersoldat: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41207/
[16:33	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, no, you need your nick registered to msg ppl

[16:33	<_6StringKng_>	hate*
[16:33	<aguitel>	bobbo: how start emerald?
[16:33	<TheRepacker>	maccam94, something else then has to be miss configured then, I really can't help that much, nvidia here I had enough problems getting it to work, I kept at it now stable with *all* the toys
[16:33	<MasterShrek>	oh d2dchat, nvm
[16:33	<Vlet>	rflmnz: is it a dell optiplex 745 too?

[16:33	<_6StringKng_>	cant wait to put my 7600 in and try compiz on it
[16:33	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, thats strange, gnome must be trying to load something
[16:33	<bobbo>	aguitel: is Compiz running now?
[16:33	<joseaa>	It it just me or can anyone else reproduce the problem ?
[16:33	<abhibera>	yea but why this bash: /usr/bin/command-not-found: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
[16:33	<aguitel>	bobbo: yes
[16:33	<SlimG3>	Is there any logos representing the (current) ubuntu release codename? like a hedgehog for hoary, this would be great since all the codenames represents animals in different "moods"
[16:33	<rflmnz>	I hate ATI in general too!!!
[16:33	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, do u think it's a xorg configuration issue?
[16:33	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, id help you more, but im not running with gnome
[16:33	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: yea but why this ? bash: /usr/bin/command-not-found: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
[16:33	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, i dont think so
[16:33	<unibroue>	Gek_ : What's you main expectation? Speed? Data Recovery?
[16:33	<Gek_>	what file system would be best to use on a raid 1 system?  ext3 riserfs, xfs, or jfs?
[16:34	<johnh>	can anyone edit this for me (not to auto mount): http://pastebin.com/d26d6f17b
[16:34	<MasterShrek>	abhibera, sudo apt-get install python
[16:34	<bobbo>	aguitel: make sure Compiz isnt set to be using Metacity then restart X and you should be using Emerald
[16:34	<xoob>	what repo has emerald-themes?
[16:34	<jxxt>	KL,
[16:34	<rflmnz>	vlet: no... NF410 mobo, Athlon 64 3700+
[16:34	<maccam94>	TheRepacker, yeah it worked great on my nvidia machine too. there's just something weird going on with this intel machine, and it's dell's preloaded ubuntu laptop so you'd think it would work well
[16:34	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, let me try something brb
[16:34	<astro73>	since I'm lacking a webbrowser ATM, can someone help me out as to why Xorg would have refresh rates completely off?

[16:34	<Ubersoldat>	danielbw: so? you've got your modem and your sound card
[16:34	<pike_>	astro73: :)
[16:35	<danielbw>	Ubersoldat: do you think it';s possible the system is using the modem speaker instead of the soundcard?
[16:35	<Gek_>	unibroue... so with a nas and 2 mirrored rives... I guess i'm wanting max speed
[16:35	<murlidhar>	any alternative torrent client to rtorrent?
[16:35	<rflmnz>	Is there a newer drive (newer than 8.40.4) that fixes the black screen problem?
[16:35	<johnh>	Where to add noauto @ the end of each line?
[16:35	<stinger05>	what package can i download for an offline installation of my nvidia geforce 7 series ?
[16:35	<src>	johnh, done. $30 bucks please.

[16:35	<johnh>	src :P
[16:35	<Greencookie>	Is anyone else having a problem when trying to install Ubuntu 7.10 on a 64-bit machine?
[16:35	<Vlet>	rflmnz: yeah, like I said, I looked into it, and on one hand I had people saying "yeah, it works", but on the other other hand the docs say, "x1300 is UNSUPPORTED"... so I gave up and spent the $130 or so on an EVGA Nvidia 8600, and it works soo well
[16:36	<murlidhar>	somebody told me gbittorrent but i can't find it anywhere
[16:36	<johnh>	src i am a poor guy
[16:36	<KL>	yeah jxxt, but no one runs, I tried to select Custom, in Appearence, but it returns to Extra Effects..
[16:36	<Ubersoldat>	danielbw: but try pluging some earphones to test
[16:36	<_6StringKng_>	yeah nvidia is better for linux if yah ask me
[16:36	<ton1>	gparted bug in the last ubuntu liveCD
[16:36	<TheRepacker>	maccam94, it will probably need some manual edit in xorg.conf, thats was what I had to do plus revert back to an older driver
[16:36	<Ubersoldat>	danielbw: if you dont get any sound, then that's the problem
[16:36	<Sp0tUb>	!NTFS
[16:36	<Ubotwo>	ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse

[16:37	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, is failsafe Gnome running the old version of Gnome or Gnome 2.2?
[16:37	<unibroue>	gek_ : Go with ReiserFS if it's to deal with a large number of small files ... and if not go with JFS
[16:37	<_6StringKng_>	I use windows for one game, thats it, lol
[16:37	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, i think its just gnome with some things disabled
[16:37	<flick_>	abhibera, as it's NTFS... :)
[16:37	<Zambezi>	It took 80 seconds to install scsitools on Gutsy server. Anyone else thinks the packagemanager is really slow in Gutsy?
[16:37	<maccam94>	TheRepacker, well, thanks anyways :-\
[16:37	<pike_>	stinger05: package.ubuntu.com and download the recommended debs as well
[16:37	<XsteelWolf>	By any chance does anyone knows how to install chinese fonts in wine?
[16:37	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, Gnome 2.2?

[16:37	<pike_>	stinger05: packages.ubuntu.com i mean
[16:37	<jjj__>	can i request for ubuntu cds and kubuntu ON EVERY release? I have a slow internet conection and my only resort is to request for them...I like giving copies of it to my classmates...

[16:37	<Vlet>	Zambezi: it's the servers
[16:37	<xoob>	emerald-themes package.. which repo has it??
[16:37	<TheRepacker>	stinger05, waht card and do you have multi-core cpu?
[16:37	<ton1>	but in archlinux, gparted don' t bug
[16:38	<rflmnz>	vlet: Man, but it is LINUX, the machines must to curve to US and not WE curve to the machines! Thats the spirit!
[16:38	<Toptyg>	HOw to localisation FluxBox?
[16:38	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, i believe so
[16:38	<Zambezi>	MasterShrek: Vlet Not from Sweden. They were downloaded in 800 KB/s.
[16:38	<flick_>	abhibera, seems like that... linux either knows more about NTFS, or my hard partition is messed up
[16:38	<Greencookie>	Someone please help me install Gutsy :(
[16:38	<aguitel>	bobbo: the borders are not good
[16:38	<flick_>	abhibera, i'd hope it's the former that is correct
[16:38	<jjj__>	can i request for ubuntu cds and kubuntu ON EVERY release? I have a slow internet conection and my only resort is to request for them...I like giving copies of it to my classmates...
[16:38	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: now i get this when i do a gcc The program 'gcc' can be found in the following packages:

[16:39	<Zambezi>	MasterShrek: It took three-four hours to install Gutsy too.

[16:39	<flick_>	hi, i clicking resume doesn't work for Deluge after i pause a torrent - would be glad at any pointers i can look at to fix this
[16:39	<Greencookie>	kmaynard: think that should work?
[16:39	<ton1>	why gpated check sdc0 , and it ' s exist
[16:39	<beni_>	Greencookie: Gutsy is still alpha, I experienced some probs with it, too - regarding the X-Server basically. Why dont you just keep Feisty?
[16:39	<kmaynard>	Greencookie, also try alternate cd...less prone to errors
[16:39	<Vlet>	kanpachi: torrent is the fastest way at the moment
[16:39	<hasse>	hey, i have a archive compressed with .ace, when i try to unace it with : #unace x archive.* it completes but dont extract anything, if i try on a windows there's no problem
[16:39	<bobbo>	aguitel: actaully i had the same problem, i think i rebooted and it went, though it could be something different
[16:39	<murlidhar>	any terminal torrent client apart from rtorrent?
[16:39	<hasse>	anyone ?
[16:39	<mcquaid>	i'm installed ubuntu for a friend today who currently has vista.  It's great that ubuntu automatically mounts the existing ntfs partition but I have a question about permissions
[16:40	<KL>	before installing Gutsy, i tried the compiz in feisty, and the cube  and other effects were running, the compiz was unstable then, but now, when I installed the gutsy, compiz isnt right...
[16:40	<Greencookie>	beni_ I want in on the lastest version ;)
[16:40	<stinger05>	under which category can i find my nvidia drivers at http://packages.ubuntu.com/gutsy/ ???
[16:40	<kmaynard>	Greencookie, i think if it doesnt work now, other options are worth a try, no?
[16:40	<d-rock>	My docking station video stopped working right after upgrade to 7.10. After a lot of trial and error I got it to the correct resolution, but the height it stretched such that the bottom 150-200 pixels are off the bottom of the screen. On the laptop screen everything looks right.
[16:40	<aguitel>	bobbo: ok
[16:40	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: yes it is enabled
[16:40	<chippy>	flick_ using the latest deluge, or the "stable" ?
[16:40	<Neodudeman>	Ugh. Gutsy has screwed me over.
[16:40	<Greencookie>	kmaynard: alternate CD, you mean burn it again?
[16:40	<beni_>	Greencookie: Oh damn, release was yesterday ;)
[16:40	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: universe is enabled
[16:40	<genii>	shortnick: I did a lookup on your IP, it seems in Portugal. Since you are going 5.10 ->	6.06 first step, all mirrors still contain 6.06. the portugeuese mirror seems currently overloaded however, due to 7.10 release. You may want to try an alternate, or wait a few days or so for things to quiet down.
[16:40	<Jeriath>	ok, im rying to run firestarter at startup...problem is it has to be run as root user
[16:40	<Jeriath>	anyoen knwo how to do this
[16:40	<mcquaid>	Obviously you can't apply unix like permissions to the ntfs part, but what my buddy wants is for his ubuntu account to have read/write to the ntfs part, which in will by default, but for others to only have read to the ntfs part
[16:40	<Vlet>	Neodudeman: how so?
[16:40	<teenbeat2007_lap>	question. i have a dual boot winxp and ubuntu and i have to clean install winxp do i need to re-installe also ubuntu or can i dlete partition of windows reinstall windows en grub
[16:40	<pasquale>	hello
[16:40	<beni_>	Greencookie: But today i tried gutsy on my gf's laptop and it caused graphic errors...
[16:40	<pasquale>	chan italy?
[16:40	<Jeriath>	i tried sessions, but it doesnt work
[16:40	<Neodudeman>	oh Vlet, you' still here? lol
[16:40	<Greencookie>	beni_: Yeah I got it yesterday, but couldnt get it to work.
[16:41	<Greencookie>	beni_: X crashed?
[16:41	<MasterShrek>	abhibera, type: echo $PATH     and give me the output, because if gcc is in /usr/bin you should be able to access it, its strange that its giving you an error...btw what are you trying to compile?
[16:41	<Neodudeman>	Vlet: so I tried just reinstalling my fiesty fawn

[16:42	<Neodudeman>	Vlet: lol
[16:42	<mcquaid>	I thought removing the other user from plugdev group, but not sure how else that would impact the user, and plugdev isn't available in users and groups
[16:42	<Pici>	ima-n00b: What kind of error?
[16:42	<administrator>	hey

[16:46	<MasterShrek>	zyberzero, compiz-settings-manager maybe

[16:50	<csabull>	beni_: can you help me?
[16:50	<bobbo>	TheRepacker: compiz-fusion si good, but Ubuntu needed to package the manager by default, this place will be full of folk wanting it
[16:50	<beni_>	lavender_dream: yeah, but i had the same problems with VLC + mp3 and i solved it by making VLC more "silent"
[16:50	<keb>	when i rebooted after upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10, the md driver was not loaded so /dev/md/0 does not exist.  how can i get md loaded at boot?
[16:51	<Terrasque>	lavender_dream: check if volume is to full on the pc, and if it is, turn it a bit lower
[16:51	<Vlet>	LjL: They don't have gutsy. they have a gutsy pre-release, and it sounds like people trying to "upgrade" from a prerelease to current have been having problems
[16:51	<aguitel>	bobbo: you solve this?
[16:51	<gharz>	boboo... where can i find that compiz-fusion in 7.10? i've just upgraded from 7.04 but i can't find it.
[16:51	<LjL>	Vlet: they do? i've had gutsy for a while now, and not a problem.
[16:51	<TheRepacker>	bobbo,  and confused when it does work the way they have seen on TouTube
[16:51	<beni_>	csabull: nope, sorry I just thought you'd probably have the same problem as I had (graphic problems after gutsy install). Anyway, the laptop has been "restored" to feisty now and it works great
[16:51	<bobbo>	aguitel: is it still not working?
[16:51	<ton1>	 beni_:  gksudo don' t crach gparted when, i create, delete partition, but after the works, gparted closed when, it 's scanne partition

[16:52	<bobbo>	aguitel: are the Emerald borders stil not working?
[16:52	<DanaG>	Solution to Compiz using emerald:
[16:52	<TheRepacker>	gharz, install CCSM

[16:54	<computerex>	I thought it gutsy would install it automatically, but it doesn't :(
[16:54	<kl4m>	computerex, beni_: Lexmark are kind of "win-printers". All is in the driver and the device is very dumb
[16:54	<miir>	hello
[16:54	<CapaH>	How can I totally get rid of all desktop icons ... Anyone?

[16:54	<beni_>	kl4m: I know.. It was freaking me out and we'll never ever buy this brand again
[16:54	<kl4m>	computerex, beni_: So making a driver for Linux without help from Lexmark is a dauting task
[16:54	<stray77>	Espen, what is the problem?
[16:54	<numus>	not the terminal.. but the run
[16:54	<flick_>	is it okay if i skip Synaptic Package Manager to install a more up-to-date version of a package?

[16:55	<n3uro5i5>	hi
[16:55	<Moduliz0r>	hi, how can I limit total system bandwidth (as in speed, not total bandwidth) in Ubuntu?
[16:55	<aguitel>	bobbo: ok
[16:55	<stinger05>	beni_: i mean i want to get a package in which i can use for offline installation, on a pc that "does not" have a internet connection..
[16:55	<LjL>	flick_: often not.
[16:55	<MickoD>	tsukasa: sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda returns nothing

[16:55	<IanLiu>	How do I mount an ISO image?
[16:55	<Pici>	!iso >	IanLiu (Please see the private messsage from ubotu)
[16:55	<jxxt>	flick, and that would be??
[16:55	<numus>	whats the run hotkey command
[16:55	<beni_>	IanLiu: google for "mount iso image ubuntu"
[16:55	<gharz>	miir, i think fresh install would be better
[16:55	<ReL1K>	anyone got any ideas on my issue? If i copy english information, and go to paste it, it pastes out garbage, sometimes its like chinese chars, other times its just garbage characters, anyone got any ideas?
[16:55	<tsukasa>	MickoD, how many partitions does the harddrive have?
[16:55	<beni_>	IanLiu: Wait i'll search it for you
[16:55	<Vlet>	miir: I think most are very happy, but as you can see from this room, some are not
[16:55	<Ecnarf371>	Hi there. I'm new to Linux, and IRC. I just downloaded and installed the new version of Linux, and it won't even boot! I don't even get to a splash screen!

[16:55	<airtonarantes>	IanLiu: how thus?
[16:55	<MickoD>	in paragon i see two

[16:56	<genii>	!iso | ianliu
[16:56	<Ubotwo>	ianliu: To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename>	<mountpoint>	» - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
[16:56	<n3uro5i5>	anyone knows this program?
[16:56	<bobbo>	Ecnarf371: have you tried doing a reburn at a sloer speed?
[16:56	<Heckman>	NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFF
[16:56	<MickoD>	1 5g fat32 then the rest of the 250g drive is ntfs

[16:56	<Espen>	stray77 , When i boot from the xd, i get to the menu, but when i try starting the installation, i get the message "PROBLEM: Cant read from boot device"
[16:56	<sorsis>	ReL1K: could there be some kind of encoding problem between utf and ascii or similar?
[16:56	<gharz>	i think fresh install is better if you want ubuntu

[16:56	<danielbw>	Ubersoldat: I am getting some good info from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
[16:56	<KL>	LjL, whats the point?
[16:56	<miir>	gharz, well kinda ... I'm getting rid of Vista and going to give linux a fair chance =)
[16:56	<Moduliz0r>	how can I limit total system bandwidth (as in speed, not total bandwidth) in Ubuntu?
[16:56	<LjL>	Heckman: don't spam
[16:56	<Vlet>	n3uro5i5: right click it and select properties
[16:56	<LjL>	KL: the point of what?
[16:56	<MickoD>	i wanna resize the ntfs down to about 100g
[16:56	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: i got a weird problem
[16:56	<numus>	whats the run hotkey
[16:56	<Ecnarf371>	Well, the Live CD worked, and it seemed to install correctly. Why would a slower burn help?
[16:56	<ton1>	install is finish...... bye but sudo or gksudo with gparted bug , ubuntu is good distribution
[16:56	<MasterShrek>	abhibera, i know
[16:56	<sorsis>	MickoD: ntfsresize app
[16:57	<genii>	numus: alt-f2
[16:57	<Vlet>	numus: ctrl-f2
[16:57	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: the symlink for gcc shows a X in nautilius
[16:57	<ton1>	bye
[16:57	<gharz>	miir, ubuntu is the best distro so far that i've tried... also tried pclinuxOS and opensuse but for me ubuntu stands out.
[16:57	<stray77>	Espen, at the install screen choose the test cd option first, itll tell you if you got a bad cd
[16:57	<miir>	the reason I came here though is cause I need help partioning ...
[16:57	<bobbo>	Ecnarf371: ah i thought you meant the CD wasnt booting, so you installed gutsy and now it wont boot?
[16:57	<Heckman>	NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFF
[16:57	<numus>	genii gets the point
[16:57	<Vlet>	numus: oh duh yeah, alt
[16:57	<MickoD>	then create another about 60g fat32 for sharing data between the two os and then ext3 and swap at end of drive with left over
[16:57	<Ecnarf371>	Yeah
[16:57	<d2dchat>	How can I tell if I'm using the free ATI driver or not?
[16:57	<Ecnarf371>	It installed fine
[16:57	<ReL1K>	sorsis, any idea how i could reset those or even check it out?
[16:57	<tsukasa>	MickoD, heres what I would do... boot into windows, merge everything into one giant NTFS partition (which will fix the partition table if its damaged), then split it into two ntfs partitions however you like
[16:57	<MasterShrek>	abhibera, thats interesting, do this in a terminl: sudo ls -l /usr/bin/gcc
[16:57	<murlidhar>	!info bittornado
[16:57	<murlidhar>	!test
[16:57	<Ubotwo>	Package bittornado does not exist in
[16:57	<Ubotwo>	Failed.
[16:57	<MickoD>	sorsis: from command line?
[16:57	<gharz>	support is the best especially when you ask the people in this room... everybody is soooo helpful.
[16:57	<computerex>	I have used a HOWTO to get the printer working on Edgy, would it work in Gutsy as well?
[16:57	<sorsis>	MickoD: yep
[16:57	<beni_>	Ecnarf371: With burning slower you minimize the chance of CD-Burning errors. If just one Bit on the CD is corrupted importat parts wont work
[16:57	<numus>	i am contemplating a fresh 7.10 install
[16:57	<Moduliz0r>	!info tickle
[16:57	<Ubotwo>	Package tickle does not exist in
[16:57	<stray77>	Espen, also if you have to reburn a copy, check the md5sum for the iso to make sure its not corrupted
[16:57	<bobbo>	Ecnarf371: sorry must leave
[16:57	<tsukasa>	MickoD, on the partition your installing linux on, do a full ntfs format (not quick)
[16:57	<Ecnarf371>	Now, I get some text about my computer when it starts up (looks like a regular startup) then just stops

[16:58	<tsukasa>	MickoD, in windows? why not
[16:58	<MickoD>	the problem is, the patition tool won't work
[16:58	<MickoD>	oh right
[16:58	<Gun_Smoke>	The channel is moving so fast today its hard to keep up.. Perhaps the channels should be limited in numbers before being broken off into side channels to limit traffic?

[16:59	<zouhair>	No one here with a Broadcom that managed to make it work in Gutsy,?
[16:59	<jxxt>	gharz, what is the problem??

[17:00	<tsukasa>	MickoD, anyways if ubuntu still doesnt see it after that, you might want to try either a) trying the alt install cd or b) looking for hardware issues
[17:00	<numus>	elhoir you can play dvds in ubuntu
[17:00	<orionr>	is there a command to copy everything like in a directory that displays all the files on the internet? something like a wget with some option

[17:00	<tsukasa>	MickoD, the alt install cd has more drivers and weird shit in my experience so it may work where the livecd doesnt
[17:00	<Ecnarf371>	Thanks zouhair, but I cant even boot, let alone install stuff right now
[17:00	<Ballena>	will alla my programs that I have installed on Ubuntu 7.04 work on Ubuntu 7.10 after a upgrade?
[17:00	<stray77>	Espen, that means the .iso file is good, but the cd you burned is corrupted in some way. try reburning the .iso on different media or at a slower speed.
[17:00	<numus>	elhoir have you tried totem movie player
[17:00	<elhoir>	i cant original ones

[17:01	<Ecnarf371>	zouhair: No, I installed the new version of linux and now it won't even start up past GRUB
[17:01	<elhoir>	it*
[17:01	<TheWood>	320 = 302
[17:01	<gharz>	jxxt, right now i'm having problem running compiz...
[17:01	<ReL1K>	sorsis, can be anywhere, a text document, a shell, a web page, anything...strange is if i copy and paste from myVM (which is vista) it copies to my primary OS fine (ubuntu)
[17:01	<numus>	Anyone really good with networking
[17:01	<miir>	anyone ?
[17:01	<kl4m>	computerex, you can remove the line about the CD in /etc/apt/sources.list, or make it a comment by prepending #
[17:01	<zouhair>	Ecnarf371 : what's the error message?
[17:01	<numus>	i am trying to figure out a way to share videos over ubuntu so my xbmc can read them

[17:02	<ZAKhan>	do i need to install xgl for compiz for 7.10?
[17:02	<Ecnarf371>	zouhair: There is none. It just stops loading.
[17:02	<gharz>	i've already installed ccsm and i always get a warning that says "Desktop effect can not be enabled". i wonder what is wrong.
[17:02	<stray77>	Espen, are you burning with the same drive that you are then trying to install with? or installing on a different system?
[17:02	<Greencookie>	Gutsy sucks:(
[17:02	<gharz>	i was using beryl prior to upgrading t0 7.04
[17:02	<computerex>	I does not!
[17:02	<adante>	anybody here built custom kernel module?
[17:02	<zouhair>	Ecnarf371 : how did you install it?
[17:02	<abhibera>	Greencookie: patience buddy we givin it for free
[17:02	<Greencookie>	I can't even get it to install
[17:02	<LjL>	murlidhar: yeah
[17:02	<ReL1K>	sorsis: hehe
[17:02	<jxxt>	gharz, Compiz can be an ordeal what is wrong?
[17:02	<Ecnarf371>	I can't tell if it sucks or not, it won't even boot! I was dual booting windows and 7.04 before this just fine
[17:02	<Espen>	stray77 , im burning with the same system i'm trying to install on, yes
[17:02	<abhibera>	Greencookie why?
[17:02	<elhoir>	and now i am upgrading another computer and it runs VERY SLOW
[17:02	<LjL>	murlidhar: but not after iirc, iirc means "if i recall correctly" :)
[17:02	<computerex>	@Greencookie, it took me like 25 minutes to install it, and activate compiz fusion
[17:02	<agentSG>	Question with 7.10: Have ATI card. Desktop effects were working before the upgrade from 7.04. Now, when I enable them, the windows lose their frames. I guess the window manager stops running or something.
[17:02	<miir>	hehe green , then how do you know it sucks ^^
[17:02	<Greencookie>	all I see is big red letters that say "OUT OF RANGE"
[17:03	<genii>	gharz: Likely you need composite extension enabled in xorg.conf
[17:03	<Ecnarf371>	zouhair: Downloaded the info, burned a cd
[17:03	<nico1>	crazy xD
[17:03	<flagel>	I tried to install gobuntu but apparently the part of installing gobuntu-desktop was broken so then I installed the CLI-version and added gobuntu-desktop from there, however this changes the GRUB menu.lst to a quiet version which makes it impossible to type in the LUKS-password, I tried to change the menu.lst but it changes back after every update-grub, why?
[17:03	<soctu>	I upgraded from fiesty and wow i'm really regretting it. i'm having the no borders problem and it takes an extra 20 seconds to load the os
[17:03	<Greencookie>	lol miir, just the install part ;)
[17:03	<murlidhar>	LjL: Thanks and how do setup the the download directory?
[17:03	<beni_>	Moduliz0r: we got a ready-to-use script for traffic control, interested?
[17:03	<zouhair>	weird
[17:03	<LjL>	murlidhar: not sure
[17:03	<stray77>	Espen, is your burner set to master, slave or cable select?
[17:03	<gutsyAleExXxX>	Hi, how come the text in the terminal is slightly bigger in gutsy ?
[17:03	<SNy>	Greencookie: Same here. The mga is bugged, apparently.
[17:03	<genii>	Greencookie: Use vga mode then
[17:03	<miir>	noone here that knew anything about my partion question ? ^^
[17:03	<Greencookie>	I guess GUTSY doesn't like my ATI card.
[17:03	<Greencookie>	genii: how?
[17:03	<Espen>	stray77 ,  i dont know
[17:03	<ReL1K>	sorsis: i think i found it actually, theres a bugtrack on virtualbox
[17:03	<beni_>	gutsyAleExXxX: They changed to font size probably? :)
[17:04	<Greencookie>	SNy: whats full form of 'mga'?
[17:04	<murlidhar>	LjL: k i will find out by googling thnks :)
[17:04	<sorsis>	ReL1K: great
[17:04	<pike_>	Greencookie: that is monitor issue to fix 1) alt-ctrl-f2  2) sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  3) choose default for most stuff but under res only check what your monitor is capable of
[17:04	<SNy>	genii: vga, haha. For 1680x1050?
[17:04	<numus>	anyone know it gutsy really has logitech mx5000 support?
[17:04	<keb>	hmm is there no more initrd-tools in gutsy?
[17:04	<SNy>	matrox graphics adapter driver.
[17:04	<jxxt>	Greencookie, Linux does not like ati cards in general
[17:04	<genii>	Greencookie: The install cd has that option on the menu before it starts to go to the default install
[17:04	<stray77>	numus, id like to know that too!
[17:04	<gutsyAleExXxX>	beni_: I mean relative to everything else that is supposedly the same size font :)
[17:04	<Sliker_Hawk>	Is it particularly bad if X-Server just managed to restart itself while doing the upgrade and I've now got a partially new operating syste,?
[17:04	<thebigham>	my windows keep sticking to the side...its getting really annoying. the windows are like sticky jelly. how can i make it not sticky??????????????????????????????????????
[17:04	<Greencookie>	genii: ok imma try one last time.
[17:04	<Greencookie>	wish me luck people.
[17:04	<miir>	oh well if noone says anything it can't be all that bad =) , I'll go with /swap 1024, /boot 256 and the rest on /
[17:04	<pike_>	Sliker_Hawk: usually fine just run upgrade again
[17:04	<Greencookie>	cya in a couple.
[17:05	<gharz>	jxxt, i don't know what is wrong...  in Apprearance Prefences.. . when i choose Normal, Extra of Custom... after closing it it says "Desktop could not be enabled".
[17:05	<genii>	SNy: It can be changed afterwards when hardware is known properly
[17:05	<Ecnarf371>	I'm going to flat out reinstall- I'll come back and let you know what happens.
[17:05	<r0b->	damn it!
[17:05	<gharz>	jxxt, i was using beryl prior to my upgrade.

[17:05	<Pirate_Hunter>	how do I lower resolution for my login screen in gutsy?
[17:05	<SNy>	genii: Oh, I tried, thanks. I just compiled mga 1.9.100 myself.
[17:06	<soctu>	no borders
[17:06	<Moduliz0r>	join/quitspam :|
[17:06	<Espen>	stray77 ,  i dont know what it is
[17:06	<miir>	oki thx =) , cya when i get there ! Vista, never again ^^
[17:06	<dan-g>	Hi, I'm having a problem getting to the restricted drivers manager, getting the following error: You need to install the package  linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-generic for this program to work.  Where/How do I get that?
[17:06	<miir>	bye for now ;)
[17:06	<Pici>	r0b-: yes it is.
[17:06	<aibo>	heya, who has already upgraded to 7.10?
[17:06	<unkn0wn>	hello
[17:06	<SNy>	No go. So I can only assume that the current xorg and mga status is... not-working.
[17:06	<jxxt>	gharz, This is a guess but I think that your graphics card is not up to the task.. Or Compiz thinks that at least :-9
[17:06	<soctu>	I did
[17:06	<gharz>	uhmmm...
[17:06	<aibo>	how is it?
[17:06	<soctu>	I have no borders and it takes 20 more seconds to load
[17:07	<stray77>	Espen, well id suggest making sure it is set to master on your secondary ide controller
[17:07	<gharz>	this is disappointing.
[17:07	<gharz>	:((
[17:07	<Espen>	stray77 ,  i dont know how to do it..
[17:07	<Gek_>	where do i get md5's for ubuntu-7.10-server-i386 ?
[17:07	<soctu>	I would wait another 30 days for updates
[17:07	<__sc>	does anyone know how to automatically update repositories in gusty 7.10.  i enabled some broken repositories and now it take forever to do updates.  i read about apt-spy, but i think it's only a debain thing.
[17:07	<jxxt>	gharz, What card are you running??
[17:08	<PanicByte>	hey, does anyone know how strong the new LVM encryption is on ubuntu?
[17:08	<ReL1K>	sorsis:  thanks for the help, i guess sometimes all it takes is talking to someone
[17:08	<dn4>	Gnome-WARNING **: invalid gnome config path '=/section/key' GLib-GObject-WARNING **: <-- getting that in console when upgrading
[17:08	<stray77>	Espen, there are jumpers on the back of your burner, usually labeled mas, slv, cs.  put the jumper on mas and remove any other device from the same ide cable.
[17:08	<Pici>	dn4: when running update-manager -c ?
[17:08	<dn4>	upgrading to gutsy :D
[17:08	<joar>	Pirate_hunter: I think gdm/kdm/xdm (loginscreen) defaults to the first resolution available in you xorg.conf file
[17:09	<gharz>	jxxt, hold on... let me just check that out.
[17:09	<lavender_dream>	quit
[17:09	<Sliker_Hawk>	 /list on this server = a bad idea.
[17:09	<Pici>	dn4: if you ran `sudo update-manager -c` I could see that happening.
[17:09	<Espen>	stray77 ,  i doubt that's the problem, ive had my friend burning a CD to me
[17:09	<soctu>	no borders
[17:09	<gharz>	jxxt, intel 82852/82855 GM
[17:10	<genii>	joar Pirate_Hunter Yes it uses the leftmost value of whatever resolutions are there
[17:10	<Pirate_Hunter>	joar: it uses the highest resolution possible but i have lowered it down however I do not know how to lower it for login screen which is mind bogling
[17:10	<dn4>	Pici, hmm did not run that
[17:10	<soctu>	well this is not going to work
[17:10	<Pici>	dn4: What did you do?
[17:10	<soctu>	hasta la pasta ya'll
[17:10	<nrdb>	I am trying to find the man pages for sprintf but I can find the correct package.  I have installed the manpages-dev package.  what do I install ?
[17:10	<Pirate_Hunter>	genii: how can I lower the resolution in my login screen as it is too high
[17:10	<kl4m>	I get http://pastebin.ca/742480 when I try to upgrade from an ISO instead of from the net. what's wrong?
[17:10	<ianm1>	any debugging tips for networkmanager?  I plug in a wifi card and it doesn't show a local, open AP 5 feet away.  the wifi DID work with the gutsy live CD and the first time I booted gutsy
[17:10	<genii>	Pirate_Hunter: you need to set Virtual to whatever you want gd,/kdm to be
[17:11	<genii>	*gdm/kdm
[17:11	<Espen>	stray77 ,  i doubt that's the problem, ive had my friend burning a CD to me
[17:11	<leroutier>	Who to ask to be able to upload to my PPA ?
[17:11	<harm>	I keep getting a gstreamer plugin to decode MP3 cannot be found when iam importing my music.. how and where do i get it?
[17:11	<Pirate_Hunter>	genii: kk I understand that but how do I actually do it?
[17:11	<jxxt>	gharz, Maybe that will work.. do you have the correct drivers??
[17:11	<computerex>	I am downloading a package, but it's stuck at "% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.89.6)]
[17:11	<computerex>	"
[17:11	<Pici>	leroutier: ask in #launchpad
[17:11	<gharz>	yes...
[17:11	<joar>	Pirate_hunter: Modes      "1600x1200" "1280x1024" defaults to 1600x1200, but if I switch them, gdm defaults to 1280
[17:11	<gharz>	jxxt, i think so.
[17:11	<leroutier>	Pici, thanks
[17:11	<computerex>	Is that because of server traffic?
[17:11	<kl4m>	computerex: the US Ubuntu archive is getting hammered
[17:12	<gharz>	coz i've just upgraded to 7.10. do u think the upgrade replaced my driver?
[17:12	<msmitha>	Good morning guy... a little help for a newbie please
[17:12	<dn4>	Pici, Systems ->	Admin ->	update Manager ->	Upgrade
[17:12	<Pirate_Hunter>	joar: where is the actual menu for me to lower screen resolution i need it for login screen as it shows ok when i actually login
[17:12	<Alp`>	how can i add/remove commands for the boot startup?
[17:12	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: don't ask to ask... ;-)
[17:12	<Adylass>	Hello, I would like to run the lastest Evolution mail client. The good version is in gusty, I run feisty. How I can do that ?
[17:12	<kdubois>	the ubuntu servers are being hit hard these days...
[17:12	<genii>	Pirate_Hunter: open /etc/X11/xorg.conf in admin mode by alt-f2 then gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[17:12	<msmitha>	this is the very first time I am using this OS and have no clue what I am doing here
[17:12	<kl4m>	Pirate_Hunter: search for Failsafe X
[17:13	<harm>	msmitha: what u need done?
[17:13	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: good place to start
[17:13	<adlisyakir>	wat is different gobuntu and ubuntu?? it's is same
[17:13	<dn4>	msmitha, are you inside of a console?
[17:13	<gharz>	jxxt, i noticed that it runs for at least 20 seconds and then goes back to it normal state
[17:13	<TheRepacker>	gharz, check your xorg.conf, something is not enabled
[17:13	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: if you know what you don't know, you know what to ask about
[17:13	<kdubois>	msmitha: welcome to the tribe then :-D
[17:13	<jxxt>	gharz, This is too clever for me I would search the card and see what results other than that i can be of no more help sorry:-((
[17:13	<Black4lpha>	whats the terminal syntax to paste whatever i have copied into the folder im viewing(opt)
[17:13	<gharz>	jxxt, ok thanks.
[17:13	<gharz>	TheRepacker, ok... let me check on it.
[17:13	<genii>	Pirate_Hunter: 1 minute I'll find the link for changes to make there regarding Virtual
[17:13	<joar>	Pirate_Hunter: sorry, you've gotta configure /etc/X11/xorg.conf by hand
[17:13	<Geoffrey2>	if I need to post a kernel bug report, where in launchpad do I go?
[17:13	<Pici>	Black4lpha: There is no copy/paste file syntax for the terminal...
[17:14	<Black4lpha>	hmmm
[17:14	<Black4lpha>	how do i move a file then?
[17:14	<TheRepacker>	gharz,  what video card?
[17:14	<Pici>	Black4lpha: Move or copy?
[17:14	<Pirate_Hunter>	genii: will do so but i believed when you changed the resolution once you logged in it would affect the login screen as well which is what amazes me, why would it still be using default high resolution in the first place?
[17:14	<gharz>	intel 82852/82855 GM/GME
[17:14	<gharz>	something like that
[17:14	<kl4m>	joar: What? isn't failsafe X the solution for this exact kind of problem?
[17:14	<nrdb>	In what package is the man page for sprintf etc in ?
[17:14	<Black4lpha>	just move
[17:14	<Pici>	nrdb: manpages-dev
[17:15	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: are you going to ask your question?
[17:15	<roler>	how do I change/resync the debian-sys-maint mysql password?
[17:15	<msmitha>	I tried to IM you
[17:15	<TheRepacker>	gharz,  check out the compiz-fusion website under troubleshooting
[17:15	<Black4lpha>	in this case i want to move a file from my home folder to a file in the opt folder
[17:15	<nrdb>	Pici: I have that installed but I don't get the man pages coming up.
[17:15	<joar>	kl4m: mabye I misunderstood, I thought he wanted to alter the resolution for he's login screen
[17:15	<Pici>	Black4lpha: mv /path/to/file/old.txt /new/path/     (might need to prefix with sudo depending on the locations, also replace paths with the real paths)
[17:15	<dn4>	what is the apt-get command to upgrade tehh system? sudo apt-get upgrade
[17:15	<dn4>	?
[17:15	<kappolo_>	a
[17:16	<gharz>	TheRepacker, another question and i hope you can help me. our network has been modified for WPA-PSK TKIP... when the changed was implemented my machine became slow... when i open an apps, i normally get a 40 sec lag... apps don't open immediately.
[17:16	<joar>	kl4m: gdm/kdm/xdm seem to default to the first resolution listed in xorg.conf (sometimes, not allways)
[17:16	<Black4lpha>	ah got it, thx pici
[17:16	<Pirate_Hunter>	joar: no you didnt i only need it for the login screen yeha i know wierd but thats the case
[17:16	<kl4m>	joar: Oh. Then it's not broken. I don't know about that
[17:16	<msmitha>	I am running 6.0 and would like to upgrade to 7.10 also I need to now the basics like installing new apps. burning CD ect...
[17:16	<genii>	Pirate_Hunter: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=209474   has an example of where it should go. As to why it does not draw it's resolution setting from window manager resolution setting, gdm and kdm have the equivelent of their own xinitrc files.
[17:16	<jxxt>	dn4, go to update manager
[17:16	<computerex>	Just use the update manager
[17:16	<joar>	Pirate_Hunter: try 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf' scroll down to the line specifying modes for 24bit resolution, make sure the mode you want is listed first
[17:16	<stepomaticc>	dn4: apt-get dist-upgrade
[17:16	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: that's a big big upgrade
[17:16	<pike_>	dn4: to upgrade yes but that wont dist-upgrade
[17:16	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: to be honest, you'd probably be as well doing a clean install
[17:16	<pike_>	!update | dn4 see this
[17:17	<Pirate_Hunter>	joar: kk
[17:17	<Ubotwo>	dn4 see this: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[17:17	<Pici>	nrdb: I'm not sure then, you can do a `dpkg -L manpages-dev` to see what files (and thus what manpages) are installed
[17:17	<Pirate_Hunter>	genii: will check that out now
[17:17	<msmitha>	ok what about installing new apps. and burning CD's
[17:17	<computerex>	msmitha: synaptic
[17:17	<TheRepacker>	gharz, sounds like a driver config problem, slowing down X
[17:17	<stefg>	!software | msmitha

[17:17	<arghh2d2>	Is anyone else getting long delays on synaptic downloads
[17:17	<arghh2d2>	?
[17:17	<computerex>	!Packages
[17:17	<Ubotwo>	You can browse and search for Ubuntu packages using !Synaptic, !Adept, "apt-cache search <keywords or regex>", the "apt:/" URL in KDE, or online at http://packages.ubuntu.com - Ubuntu has about 20000 packages available, so please *search* for an official package before installing things in awkward ways!
[17:17	<Pici>	arghh2d2: yes, see topic
[17:18	<stefg>	arghh2d2, read /topic
[17:18	<numus>	arghh2d2 yes the server is slow
[17:18	<jxxt>	msmitha, apt-get install <nameof app>
[17:18	<computerex>	argh2d2: I get huge delays
[17:18	<genii>	arghh2d2: Well, yes. the repository servers are extremely overloaded with ppl trying to get/upgrade 7.10
[17:18	<arghh2d2>	i see
[17:18	<gharz>	TheRepacker, driver config problem? with the wireless? coz if i disable WPA-PSK TKIP everything goes back to normal... opening of apps is fast.
[17:18	<pike_>	msmitha: most people use k3b for cd burning though gnomebaker is the gnome default i guess
[17:18	<computerex>	It took me 15 minutes to install alien XD
[17:18	<jxxt>	msmitha, Gnomebaker
[17:18	<numus>	arghh2d2 if you are trying to get gutsy best way is to download the cd off the site
[17:18	<TheRepacker>	gharz,  sorry, wireless I can not help
[17:18	<NotSure>	I would appreciate it if you could help me with the following: I use Gnome. If I open a program and switch to a different workspace, I will see the titlebar of the program in the new workspace if that program is trying to alarm me by flashing its titlebar
[17:18	<gharz>	TheRepacker, do you have any idea or any command line on how to check on it?
[17:19	<dn4>	!mirrors
[17:19	<Ubotwo>	Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive - PLEASE use the !torrents to download Gutsy, and help keeping the servers' load low!

[17:19	<JEFFmasterFlex>	Adylass: upgrade to gutsy
[17:19	<Moduliz0r>	how do I tell apt-get that I dont have my CD ROM?
[17:19	<computerex>	There is a gutsy torrent ...?
[17:19	<arghh2d2>	numus, i was just trying to reinstall nautilus cd burner, for some reason my cd burning drive isnt mounting, any idea why this might be?

[17:20	<Pici>	!torrents >	computerex (Please see the private messsage from ubotu)
[17:20	<maxo>	since upgrading from feisty to gutsy, the fonts in firefox when displaying a web page look different - the letters are more spaced out and it doesn't look right. How do you fix this problem?
[17:20	<numus>	arghh2d2 to many reasons
[17:20	<Adylass>	JEFFmasterFlex: Well, I dont want to compromise by stability.
[17:20	<numus>	arghh2d2 first starting with the drive is burned out
[17:20	<kst->	I just installed the package fglrx-control for my ati gfx card, but how do I start it? it's not avail in bash and i cant find it in the menues
[17:20	<pike_>	Moduliz0r: you need to unselect it but i dont know gui that well i can tell you how from command line if you like
[17:20	<arghh2d2>	drive worked fine a week ago numus
[17:20	<JEFFmasterFlex>	Adylass: i think the new evolution depends on gnome 2.20 so you don't have much of a choice, i think. don't quote me on that one
[17:20	<stefg>	Adylass, you can't just use the gutsy evolution in feisty, because it depends on gnome-libs. so you either upgradem wait for a backport (if it happens) or build it yourself
[17:20	<msmitha>	Can any one please coach me on this OS cause even though I do really appriciate all the info. I am receving, its still Jibrish to me
[17:20	<NotSure>	I would appreciate it if you could help me: right now as I type this message, the titlebars of programs opened in other workspaces flash on the taskbar of the current workspace. I would like to have this disabled. I use Gnome.
[17:20	<numus>	anyone know if mx5000 is supported in gutsy
[17:20	<TheRepacker>	gharz, biggest problem with Linux is the answer is out ther.... it is trying to find it
[17:20	<msmitha>	sorry
[17:20	<Pirate_Hunter>	what is the command to back up xorg?
[17:21	<numus>	arghh2d2 that was a week ago..
[17:21	<Moduliz0r>	pike_: its on another machine, is it a simple operation on the console?
[17:21	<pike_>	Pirate_Hunter: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[17:21	<kl4m>	!upgrade | Kaitlyn2004
[17:21	<Ubotwo>	Kaitlyn2004: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[17:21	<pike_>	Moduliz0r: yes
[17:21	<Adylass>	stefg: Can you point me a guide to build it properly ?
[17:21	<hendrixski>	does anybody know the stats on just how many downloads there have been of Gutsy so far?
[17:21	<Moduliz0r>	pike_: ok what do I need to do
[17:21	<dn4>	maxo, Firefox ->	Edit ->	Preferences ->Content Tab (Fonts & Colors)
[17:21	<Adylass>	stefg: I mean, a guide to backport.
[17:21	<arghh2d2>	Does anybody know a command to query anything useful about my cd burner and why it is no longer working?
[17:21	<Pirate_Hunter>	pike_: thanx
[17:21	<maxo>	dn4: I set it to 'serif'. and I've even changed it to other fonts, but it makes no difference
[17:21	<numus>	kendrixski impossible to say.. since you have the repo ... you have torrents.. you have webdownloads from mirrors
[17:22	<stefg>	Adylass, no, i use thunderbird, but see !build for general help
[17:22	<jotil>	hendrixski: hard to tell.
[17:22	<pike_>	Moduliz0r: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list    the cd line will be the first either remove it completely or use a # at begining to comment it out save and exit nano. now 'sudo apt-get update'

[17:22	<numus>	hendrixski no.. there are A LOT of trackers
[17:23	<Moduliz0r>	pike_: ok, I'll be right back
[17:23	<jotil>	hendrixski: tracker probably keeps tracks of number of completed downloads? but trackers are probably decentralized.

[17:24	<JEFFmasterFlex>	Adylass:  i am not sure if feisty has gtk 2.12 but you will definitely need the dev libs for gtk 2.12 to build the new evolution
[17:24	<hendrixski>	jotil, numus, ah, so we'll never know just how many Ubuntu users there actually are will we
[17:24	<numus>	hendrixski the world will never know...
[17:24	<bmidgley>	my Update manager does not say there is a new release avalable
[17:24	<hendrixski>	I was thinking of doing the dist-upgrade, but that's snails-@ss slow... I should probably just torrent the ISO and install from scratch

[17:39	<YetiChick>	der0b, Yes, just right click on the little thingy for the window list and select "Preferences".  You'll see it there.
[17:40	<PuppiesAtWork>	why is openssh-server not showing up in apt or synaptic for me?

[17:42	<der0b>	yetichick: and on Gutsy?  just not seeing the option..  lemme poke around some
[17:42	<YetiChick>	der0b:  What I'm having a hard time with is getting it *not* to show all tasks from all workspaces.  I think Beryl uses workspaces differently than Gnome.
[17:42	<rhino-man>	Greencookie: Yup, running it here

[17:43	<Moduliz0r>	CosmicB: Well it must be, because I'm SSH'd into it
[17:43	<nickrud>	Moduliz0r: NetworkManager won't touch the interfaces file; if you define something there NetworkManager won't mess with it

[17:44	<CosmicB>	Modulizor: ah, he he, then it's probably loaded, but are U sure eth1 is your wireless card ? 'iwconfig' should tell

[17:56	<ray_>	guys how can i create multiple .zip files with a defined size ???
[17:56	<petfrogg>	hmm i am using ubuntu now for the first time after several install tests and stuff... i am impressed
[17:56	<Dr_willis>	pedro,  why did you install bastille ?
[17:56	<NedHiden>	gksudo is for programs with guis
[17:57	<x938>	PovAddict: you need to choose NTFS partition then resize then make a new EXT2/3 partition
[17:57	<tovella>	Doitle: ok, let me look at them a minute.
[17:57	<x938>	you cannot install linux onto a NTFS partition at least not in Ubuntu
[17:57	<pedro>	i installed for security porposes
[17:57	<PovAddict>	x938: why resize?
[17:57	<kazim59>	What the hell is this dbus??
[17:57	<danielbw>	PovAddict: so, can you answer the question? Will compiz work with fluxbox?
[17:57	<Doitle>	tovella: alright thanks
[17:57	<remix5x>	NedHiden, noted, thx
[17:57	<Pici>	kazim59: its for interprocess communication
[17:57	<x938>	you have to resize in order to then make a new partition that is EXT/2
[17:57	<flagel>	Dr_willis: may I msg you a copypaste of my entry?
[17:57	<Dr_willis>	pedro,   why do you think you need it? If you want to use it.. I would suggest a good reading of its homepage/docs.. Its a rather.. complex tool. :)
[17:57	<x938>	because otherwise 100% of your hard-disk is NTFS
[17:57	<fyrestrtr>	remix5x: because you are doing it from within X
[17:57	<nickrud>	remix5x: you can see for yourself: try sudo env | sort , and gksudo env | sort . Compare especially the home dirs. sudo gui app can screw up your preferences
[17:58	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  sure.. let me pastebin my whole menu.lst for ya also.
[17:58	<PovAddict>	x938: it's already two NTFS partitions, I want to reformat one of them
[17:58	<kazim59>	Pici: Almost every program will give me dbus errors since I've installed feisty. Moreover, I can't get obex:// work just because of dbus errors... Is dbus some service that I've turned off?
[17:58	<pedro>	dr willis what links do you recomend?
[17:58	<x938>	Reformat into what format?
[17:58	<PovAddict>	x938: well, into ext3 to install ubuntu on it... partition sizes are already OK
[17:58	<lee__>	good night
[17:58	<x938>	PovAddict: into which file system i mean?
[17:58	<RvGaTe>	The installation of gutsy is _not_ detecting my hard drive, wich makes it impossible for me to install it.... mobo: Abit IP35-E, hdd: Western Digital Caviar SE 200GB 7200rpm S-ATA.... i have no idea how to fix this... (gparted result: http://pastebin.com/m35ed27de)
[17:58	<remix5x>	hmm, it seems that a few programs won't run since I installed gutsy... like the compiz settings manager and pidgin instant messenger simply won't open.... I havent tried much else maybe its not just those.... though Xchat seems to work just fine
[17:58	<Pici>	kazim59: its possible, it should be running
[17:59	<Senken12>	Gutsy broke my sound. :)
[17:59	<Senken12>	:(
[17:59	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  http://pastebin.ca/742554    is my menu.lst for referance
[17:59	<Kyouto>	so I burnt an ISO of gutsy gibbon.... did an md5 check, everything fine. booted the disk and it booted fine, checked the integrity of the disk and it said everything was fine. tried to start ubuntu, it starts booting then just hangs on the loading screen. I walked away from the PC hoping it'd load in a while, but it didn't (probably waited about 15 minutes or more.) I've tried redownloading it from different mirrors about 3 or 4 times, still 
[17:59	<kazim59>	Pici: yes its running,.. and everything goes OK when I restart the service
[17:59	<mlankhorst>	How do I see to which package a file bleongs?
[17:59	<pedro>	dr willis what links do you recomend to study the bastille?
[17:59	<x938>	PovAddict: okay then you should just backup your data from NTFS partition #2 onto partition #1, then during the ubuntu install select EXT2/3 on the NTFS parititon and it will ask you do you want to format it, say yes
[17:59	<K3nt0>	does gibbon have better game-friendliness?
[17:59	<ray_>	guys how can i create multiple .zip files with a defined size ???
[17:59	<PovAddict>	x938: I don't need to resize it, that second partition has no files
[17:59	<Dr_willis>	pedro,  you proberly should researched the program befor jyust installing it.. hit google and search for its homepage.
[17:59	<arun__>	if i have third party repos enabled, do i need to disable them before i upgrade?
[17:59	<stray77>	PovAddict, delete the partition you want to reformat and let the ubuntu installer partition and format it like youre supposed to.
[17:59	<tovella>	Doitle: ok.  now this command, "ifconfig >	network-interfaces.txt"
[18:00	<kazim59>	Pici: even pidgin keeps giving me dbus errors...
[18:00	<Dr_willis>	pedro,  bastille can really lock down a system. and  its not really needed for 'home' users.
[18:00	<x938>	PovAddict: yes so what stray77 said :)
[18:00	<PovAddict>	ray_: I looked, and it seems the command line app 'zip' doesnt support split files
[18:00	<K3nt0>	is gibbon better with games?
[18:00	<flagel>	Dr_willis: you too have "quiet" in your menu.lst
[18:00	<11Touche]>	Kyouto: did you try to shut "splash" and "quiet" options upon boot?
[18:00	<Pici>	kazim59: very odd.  Have you tried looking on the forums for a solution?
[18:00	<Narada>	hi in the new kubuntu how do i turn compiz effects on or how do i test them; i want to see some eye candy!!!!!
[18:00	<kazim59>	Pici: yes... googled a lot too
[18:00	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  and to be honest with ya. Im not sure what noquite  and quite does.. never seen much of a differance.
[18:00	<Doitle>	tovella: what should happen then?
[18:00	<ray_>	hmmmm lemme --help it and see where i can get
[18:00	<Senken12>	Anyone know how I could fix my sound: Toshiba Satellite Pro A100. http://img267.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshotterminalpx2.png
[18:00	<ray_>	tnx
[18:00	<Pici>	!compiz-#kubuntu | Narada
[18:00	<ubotu>	Narada: Kubuntu is not shipping with compiz installed or enabled by default. You can still install it and have your eyecandy goodness. The instructions are at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/CompizFusion
[18:00	<kazim59>	Pici: every app would say that it could not get dbus reply...
[18:01	<Senken12>	Nothing comes out of the speakers... at all...
[18:01	<huy>	is anyone else having problem with nvidia-glx-new?
[18:01	<NedHiden>	Narada... go to channel #kubuntu they would know more about it
[18:01	<Pici>	kazim59: You could try reinstalling dbus
[18:01	<YetiChick>	PovAddict, have you tried peazip?
[18:01	<tovella>	Doitle: it should create a file called network-interfaces.txt - i want to see the contents of that file.
[18:01	<x938>	i swithced over linux have not regretted it for a second two weeks ago, i instaleld wine, vmware, all chat programs, and ntfs rp program, and today i just got a custom script to mass batch convert images - and i have started to contribute my new ways for the linux community since i relaized i had found a good way to do something
[18:01	<kazim59>	Pici: how? dpkg-reconfigure dbus?

[18:01	<miir>	how do I get bcm43xx-fwcutter ? I seem to need it to enable wlan card
[18:01	<flagel>	Dr_willis: the "quiet" on tha last line doesn't print debug output to the console, in other words its impossible to mount encrypted partitions since you get no output
[18:02	<x938>	part of the joy of using linux is that you can actually contribute to things that don't exist and better the world
[18:02	<Doitle>	tovella: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41216/

[18:02	<PovAddict>	YetiChick: tell ray_ about it :)
[18:02	<Pici>	kazim59: I'd try `sudo apt-get install --reinstall dbus`
[18:02	<RvGaTe>	kalifornia909: you still there ?
[18:02	<NedHiden>	miir: it's there. i had to do it last night
[18:02	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  never used encrypted  - :) but thats an interesting big. :)  does it ask for the password and you just cant see it? got to type it in blind eh?
[18:02	<NedHiden>	be sure to enable all the repositories
[18:02	<DShepherd>	I am a busy mouse icon when gdm is starting and the mouse point just keeps spininig and spining. how can i solve this?

[18:03	<bmt2>	is there a p2p app out there for ubuntu ?
[18:03	<stray77>	Noodlesgc, yes so long as you isp doesnt hinder torrents.
[18:03	<Doitle>	tovella: Well I guess the problem could be with the wireless networks I'm trying to connect to
[18:03	<PovAddict>	bmt2: any BitTorrent client
[18:03	<flagel>	Dr_willis: that would be a solution if if weren't for the fact that there are multiple partitions with different passwords and you don't know when you've typed wrongly without output
[18:03	<YetiChick>	PovAddict, Ah...  Sorry.  I s'pose I could take the time to learn to read.  Nah... :)
[18:04	<Dr_willis>	noodles13,  right now - id say yes.
[18:04	<Jhs>	i'm having the same problem as huy
[18:04	<x938>	Lavender Dream: you have to setup your default media options
[18:04	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  heh heh.. how.. interesting.
[18:04	<tovella>	Doitle: it doesn't appear that you need to do any stuff with that tar.gz file
[18:04	<bmt2>	PovAddict: is there a gui bitTorrent client out there ?
[18:04	<Noodlesgc>	how fast are the torrents?
[18:04	<huy>	Jhs you can't get nv to work as well?
[18:04	<bmt2>	that i can apt-get install ?
[18:04	<x938>	lavender_dream: go into your settings for media options and select "use this program as default and open file automatically"
[18:04	<x938>	Noodlesgc: torrents are very fast
[18:04	<flagel>	Dr_willis: so any idea?
[18:04	<stray77>	Noodlesgc, my torrents max out my connection
[18:04	<lavender_dream>	x938: where is that under? System >	Preference?
[18:04	<YetiChick>	ray_, Sorry.  Anyway, I think I've used peazip in the past for that.
[18:04	<PovAddict>	bmt2: there's dozens of them
[18:04	<Doitle>	tovella: I guess that's good news lol
[18:04	<Doitle>	tovella: Thanks for lookingat it for me
[18:04	<DShepherd>	how can i change my change my gdmgreeter from the command line?
[18:04	<Dr_willis>	Noodlesgc,  right now they are as fast as they are going to be. Most Seeders are right NOW. :) in a few weeks they will be much slower.
[18:04	<bmt2>	PovAddict: thanks
[18:04	<Noodlesgc>	how many kbps are you getting under torrent?
[18:05	<x938>	stray 77: are you on firefox ubuntu?

[18:05	<MethodOne>	!smart
[18:05	<ubotu>	smart is another meta-package manager available for Ubuntu. It's quite stable, uses APT's repositories, can handle mirrors/multiple-connections, and is supposed to make Ubuntu BiArch-compatible. See http://labix.org/smart and https://wiki.kubuntu.org/SmartPackageManager
[18:05	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  check the homepage/mailing lists for the developer stuff for the encrypted filesystem I guess. Or use the verbose/noquite options I guess..
[18:05	<lavender_dream>	x938: is that under Preferred Applications? I already set it as Custom under the Multimedia tab and typed in "vlc" without the terminal option checked.
[18:05	<greedo>	if i want graphics effect, should i go beryl ? compiz ? compiz fusion ? i'm a bit lost
[18:05	<bmt2>	hello to all
[18:05	<Dr_willis>	flagel,  i think 'noquite' is an option that makes it very verbose.
[18:05	<Noodlesgc>	i have 800kbps using http so i think ill stick with it
[18:05	<bmt2>	how do i apt-get the lastest apache and tomcat ?

[18:06	<Jhs>	huy, no. 2.6.22-14 won't start at all. and on 2.6.20-16, i can't set the resolution right
[18:06	<x938>	oh ok
[18:06	<uttara>	I have an intel 945 graphics controller. When I play movie file, the picture is not as smooth as it should be. Does anybody know the solution??
[18:06	<miir>	NedHiden: Thx =) didn't realise you could enable more ^
[18:06	<fr0nk>	is a downgrade from 7.10 to 7.04 possible?
[18:06	<greedo>	thx DARKGuy
[18:06	<x938>	fr0nk: i'd imagine you hav to backup your data and then re-install the o.s.
[18:07	<x938>	from 7.04 image
[18:07	<fr0nk>	WAH
[18:07	<x938>	or make a seperate partition
[18:07	<fr0nk>	d'oh
[18:07	<WanderingKnight>	fr0nk: what problems are you having?
[18:07	<fr0nk>	*G*
[18:07	<DARKGuy>	no problem greedo, just enable the desktop effects found in the Change Wallpaper... menu item when you right-click the desktop
[18:07	<x938>	and have a dual boot linux system 7.10/7.04
[18:07	<tovella>	Doitle: from what i recall, wireless is handled by network-manager, so if you have a wired connection active, a wireless one if tricky (and a security risk) to have connected, simultaineously.  there are ways to do it, but i don't recommend it for a new user.
[18:07	<fr0nk>	WanderingKnight: none yet, just want to have the possibility since compiz isn't working in the most current version available (approx 10 fps) in my 7.04 install
[18:07	<tovella>	Doitle: have you installed any firewall software, yet?
[18:07	<fr0nk>	since 7.10 has compiz as default...
[18:07	<x938>	stray77: did you figure it out?
[18:07	<fr0nk>	you see? ;)
[18:08	<gharz>	bye
[18:08	<ZAKhan>	will compiz work for my HDTV out of box with an ATI card installed?
[18:08	<lavender_dream>	x938: is setting my Preferred Application under Multimedia tab as Custom and typing in vlc without run in terminal checked the correct method to do this?
[18:08	<stray77>	x938, figure what out?
[18:08	<fr0nk>	beryl on the other hand runs damn smooth :)
[18:08	<dn4>	man the ubuntu gutsy upgrade servers must be getting hammered!
[18:08	<zxguitar>	j ubuntu-es
[18:08	<PovAddict>	dn4: you think? :P
[18:08	<kiru>	$ sudo kill -9 7186
[18:08	<greedo>	DARKGuy: gutsy is downloading so i did not install it yet. are there more stuff than in feisty ? effects were limited in numbers and customization
[18:08	<dn4>	20% [1 linux-image-2.6.22-14-rt 7843840/18.6MB 42%]            682B/s 12h29m41s
[18:08	<kiru>	$ ps -A | grep firefox
[18:08	<kiru>	 7186 ?        01:12:11 firefox-bin <defunct>
[18:08	<kiru>	what can i do?
[18:09	<PovAddict>	lol dn4, nice speed
[18:09	<x938>	lavender dream: go to EDIT>CONTENT>CONFIGURE FILE TYPES>MANAGE from here you can setup how firefox handles certain files and what it does automatically
[18:09	<PovAddict>	kiru: use a bigger hammer
[18:09	<PovAddict>	kiru: err
[18:09	<kiru>	PovAddict: wich hammer is bigger than kill -9?
=== cmerck is now known as navaburo
[18:09	<PovAddict>	kiru: good question
[18:09	<remix5x>	crap, i just changed a setting that disabled all the nifty window effects... when i enabled 3d cube it asked me to disable a plug in and when i said yes all the effects went away.... is there some sort of log that i can find to see what it was?
[18:09	<Dr_willis>	kiru,  that would be pulling the plug. :)
[18:09	<nickrud>	kiru: killing the parent process
[18:10	<PovAddict>	kiru: nitroglycerin?
[18:10	<penguin42>	Does gutsy still use mpt drivers for LSI SCSI cards and if so does anyone know if they are on the x86 boot CDs ?
[18:10	<navaburo>	So is it my connection or are the repos getting totally hammered?
[18:10	<kiru>	nickrud: already killed, next advice pls
[18:10	<nickrud>	kiru: then el destructo, power
[18:10	<DARKGuy>	greedo, yeah, but in Gutsy they have included CompizFusion... you just install your video drivers and enable the desktop effects and it'll be working nice and dandy (hopefully... it did on my system anyways). There's fast user switching, better configuration dialogs/panels, a desktop search tool similar to google desktop search, but better and less bloated ;), and lots of other pretty stuff... a nice kernel too :)
[18:10	<nickrud>	kiru: but try logging out first
[18:10	<x938>	lavender dreams: you might also want to setup your default download options to save to a specific place auomatically without asking, then you can have autoplay and autodownload without asking
[18:10	<navaburo>	nm i just read /topic
[18:10	<Sliker_Hawk>	ctrl+alt+backspace always works for me, Kiru.
[18:10	<lavender_dream>	x938: Okay thank you, but which directory should I point to in regards to VLC?
[18:10	<rsfriends>	how do i get x on my windows,
[18:10	<stray77>	navaburo, its not your connection
[18:10	<Dr_willis>	navaburo,  they are getting hammered
[18:10	<BankHead>	sup?
[18:10	<kiru>	nickrud: this is in this case no solution because it happens too oftenly
[18:11	<greedo>	DARKGuy: ok
[18:11	<rsfriends>	when i open a windows i can see the x r - etc
[18:11	<raphtee>	i just tried gutsy last night and i had a weird problem.  i had no mouse cursor
[18:11	<BankHead>	I'll soon find out
[18:11	<caveman24>	how do you change screen resolution in icewm?
[18:11	<Dr_willis>	rsfriends,  i use 'xming' under windows - to allow seeing of X apps.
[18:11	<x938>	lavender_dream: i am not sure, i don't use VLC i have gnome-player this depends on where you installed VLC
[18:11	<PovAddict>	kiru: buy a new computer? XDDD some idiots actually buy a new computer when it gets virus-infected
[18:11	<kiru>	well, nice tries, boys
[18:11	<DARKGuy>	PovAddict, lmao yeah, or buy a new hd X_X
[18:11	<x938>	lavender dreams: if your on a windows system it might be in c:\program files\vlc player\vlc.exe
[18:11	<kiru>	but i see you cannot help
[18:11	<lavender_dream>	x938: hmm... are most stuff installed default in usr/shr or lib..?
[18:11	<rsfriends>	dr villis i mean when i open a program or something i can se the x or _  etc
[18:11	<arpeggi>	does 'No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.' mean anything to anyone?
[18:11	<navaburo>	rsfriends, xrandr
[18:11	<remix5x>	how do i restart xserveR?
[18:11	<PovAddict>	Dr_willis: cygwin has an X server too
[18:12	<Sliker_Hawk>	ctrl+alt+backspace, Remix.
[18:12	<Pici>	remix5x: sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart
[18:12	<caveman24>	restart z = ctrl+alt+backspace
[18:12	<kst->	I wanna do the same as the 2nd post in this thread http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=2140 can someone tell me how to set up 2 X screens (sessions? dunno), one running Xorg and one running Xgl + compiz?
[18:12	<caveman24>	x*
[18:12	<x938>	lavender dream: on desktop right click>	select "create launcher" type in command "vlc player" (or whatever its called) and save this then point firefox to this launcher
[18:12	<nickrud>	kiru: stepped out, recurring huh? too much of that
[18:12	<Dr_willis>	PovAddict,  last i looked cygwin wasent getting updated any more.. It has more then just an x server. :) xming is a darn good tool :) better then cygwin for the task  (your needs may vary)
[18:12	<x938>	lavender dream: this is a work around since im not sure where your VLC player installed
[18:12	<arpeggi>	can anyone help me out>
[18:13	<ray_>	tnx PovAddict, great tool
[18:13	<PovAddict>	Dr_willis: well yeah, cygwin has an X server as an extra to its hundred tools
[18:13	<Pici>	x938: `which vlc`
[18:13	<navaburo>	Dr_willis, unless you need the cygwin xserver for some reason, i have allways found the Xming one easier to use
[18:13]  * nickrud looks back with longing to the days when the issues were only config issues
[18:13	<eodchop>	Does anyone know if there is a ubuntu support channel for Apple pc's
[18:13	<x938>	Pici: ?? which vlc?
[18:13	<Odd-rationale>	How do you change the font color of the text in the panels? e.g. calendar?
[18:13	<beedan>	harro - new to ubuntu from fedora.  is there a .deb package I could find that hat php bundled with mssql?
[18:13	<raphtee>	has anyone ever encountered the problem where there is no mouse cursor?  it is the one thing that is keeping me from gettingf gutsy installed
[18:13	<Noodlesgc>	OMG unreal 2004 is offered for Linux
[18:13	<PovAddict>	beedan: mssql on ubuntu?!
[18:13	<d1n0>	Can anyone help me so I can extend my desktop to my TV? It's connected through S-video and works out of the box as a clone!
[18:13	<Pici>	x938: `which vlc` will tell you where the vlx executable is
[18:13	<nickrud>	!lamp | beedan
[18:13	<ubotu>	beedan: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[18:14	<huy>	anybody else have problem with nvidia?
[18:14	<huy>	or Xorg?
[18:14	<PovAddict>	beedan: is that microsoft SQL or a typo of mysql?
[18:14	<DARKGuy>	Noodlesgc, it's been in Linux for ages :p
[18:14	<lavender_dream>	Pici: thank you
[18:14	<x938>	Pici: vlc player, it depends on how the user has it installed. if hte program name is "bitchx" then you make a launcher with command "bitchx" and point firefox to handle .irc files with bitchx launcher
[18:14	<beedan>	Microsoft SQL
[18:14	<huy>	I just solve the problem so if you want to know just ask me
[18:14	<PovAddict>	better be the latter
[18:14	<marx2k>	huy: like...everyone... including me
[18:14	<philip__>	Hello
[18:14	<arpeggi>	more to the point quakewars is available for linux
[18:14	<remix5x>	thanks to whoever told me how to restart xserver... i didnt know it restarted all applications though i thought xserver was just the gui frotend to linux
[18:14	<DARKGuy>	sweet
[18:14	<nickrud>	beedan: ask on ##windows
[18:14	<huy>	marx2k: check if you are using nv driver
[18:14	<huy>	get that work first
[18:14	<Pici>	x938: right, but this is a solution to your workaround
[18:14	<beedan>	This is an Ubuntu question though.
[18:14	<navaburo>	remix5x, yea, any xclients connected to the server will probably shutdown
[18:14	<marx2k>	huy: yep thats whats working right now
[18:14	<x938>	Pici: can you please repeat the solution i missed i
[18:15	<Noodlesgc>	If these companies offer games for Linux, people will have no reson not to switch
[18:15]  * nickrud wonders when microsoft sql began running on ubuntu
[18:15	<navaburo>	remix5x, but any console apps started with nohup will still be running....
[18:15	<ceed>	hello, i got few questions regarding rTorrent, anyone got a min?
[18:15	<DARKGuy>	Noodlesgc, unless they don't like FPS games ;)
[18:15	<gdi2k>	compiz fusion is really nice in gutsy, but themes, how do they work now? I see compiz themes, and I see beryl themes, I don'g know which I need, and I don't know how to install them, any pointers?
[18:15	<raphtee>	huy.  i am having problems with x.  i dont have a mouse cursor in gutsy.  any idea what that is?
[18:15	<remix5x>	navaburo, so is there a way to restart xserver without restarting xclients?
[18:15	<Pici>	x938: the command 'which appname'  will tell you where the exectuable for that app lives.
[18:15	<x938>	ah
[18:15	<d1n0>	Can anyone help me so I can extend my desktop to my TV? It's connected through S-video and works out of the box as a clone!
[18:15	<x938>	Pici: ah thank you :)
[18:15	<rsfriends>	when i open a program i cant se x, _ or  square
[18:15	<huy>	marx2k then check if nvidia-glx-new is install
[18:15	<Pici>	beedan: MSSQL does not run on linux.
[18:15	<navaburo>	remix5x, no
[18:15	<DShepherd>	nickrud, hey... my gutsy experience is not going good :-(
[18:15	<remix5x>	navaburo, ak ok, thanks :)
[18:15	<bkingx>	Need to use IIS to forward to my new Ubuntu LAMP server using host headers.  Has anyone had success forwarding from IIS to an Apache server?
[18:15	<nickrud>	DShepherd: you're not alone, I see.
[18:15	<arpeggi>	:( No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found. :(
[18:16	<marx2k>	huy: it is
[18:16	<beedan>	Of course not, I am looking for a .deb package that has MSSQL connection capabilities.
[18:16	<remix5x>	now if I can just get my raid5 to mount on here it would be phenominal
[18:16	<beedan>	FreeTDS installed great
[18:16	<philip__>	I've installed the new Ubuntu, now when I log in it gives me a choice between both kernels...When I use the old it workds fine (more or less) the new one is very buggy......the question is why do I have the choice? and what is the difference?
[18:16	<huy>	raphtee: get to a console, do dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, follow the wizard to add a mouse
[18:16	<Pici>	bkingx: ask in ##windows
[18:16	<Colro>	does anyone know why firefox might be taking 100% of my cpu time with only five tabs open? ive got an amd 1800+ and 1.5gb of ram..it never did this under windows =|
[18:16	<Noodlesgc>	Monster Energy drink sucks
[18:16	<beedan>	Now I need php to interface it
[18:16	<PovAddict>	I think I just lost my IRC connection
[18:16	<PovAddict>	I doubt this channel has gone quiet for 2 minutes
[18:16	<ceed>	do i have to uninstall older version of rTorrent when i want to install a new one?
[18:16	<mluser>	How do I set a wifi network to come up automatically on boot without waiting for a user to log in? I'm using feisty btw
[18:16	<nerdboy1024>	is there an exploit in the Remote deskop becasue someone just tried to view my desktop and i inadvertantly clicked allow, i tried nmap and nothing suspicious so i doubt and hack was accomplished, but maybe someone heard of this
[18:16	<huy>	marx2k: check your kernel version
[18:16	<penguin42>	Colro: Check for flash running in some of the tabs
[18:16	<x938>	Colro: kill the process of firefox and restart it
[18:16	<kazim59>	Pici: reinstalled dbus. same problem. DBUS starts fine. Is running as a process too. But no application seems to be able to do IPC using DBUS
[18:16	<huy>	marx2k: uname -a
[18:16	<navaburo>	remix5x, if you are working in the consle you can try screen http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/
[18:16	<x938>	Colro: it could be a certain webpage eating up resources
[18:16	<marx2k>	huy: 2.6.22-14-generic
[18:16	<PovAddict>	silly thing
[18:16	<arun__>	if i have third party repos enabled, do i need to disable them before i upgrade?
[18:17	<nickrud>	philip_: ubuntu by default never removes kernels, you have to do that by hand. And your experience is exactly why
[18:17	<jer__>	Hey everyone. Question: How do you install a driver on Ubuntu 7.10?
[18:17	<Pici>	kazim59: That is very very weird.  This is dumb, but you have tried rebooting, right?
[18:17	<huy>	marx2k: check if you installed linux-restricted-modules-2.6.22-14-generic
[18:17	<takedown>	Hi everyone, i have a trouble with fglrx. Ubuntu 7.10 and installed and ___loaded___ fglrx module, but fglrxinfo showing mesa. Anyone know wtf is that?
[18:17	<Colro>	penguin42: flash is running in one -- is flash just extremely slow for nix?
[18:17	<navaburo>	remix5x, someone once told me there was an xwindows equivanlent..... but I think they were nuts
[18:17	<mr_wang>	 HOW DO I UPDATE USING THE CD? i see no updatye
[18:17	<kazim59>	Pici: yes.. it asked me to reboot when I reinstalled dbus
[18:17	<remix5x>	navaburo, nah i'm not adamant about it, I'm going to work on getting my raid5 mounted under ubuntu, if thats even possible
[18:17	<x938>	Colro: It could be flash, try another website with flash and see how firefox responds, i have no flash problems
[18:17	<patrick_>	can someone explain how I would install this http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Glass+Icons+Theme?content=32146 ???
[18:17	<penguin42>	Colro: Try right clicking on the flash  you can tell it to be slower
[18:17	<PovAddict>	I'm losing connection way too often
[18:17	<navaburo>	takedown, mesa is software 3D, it works, but VERY slow
[18:18	<WanderingKnight>	patrick_: download and open it with the themes manager
[18:18	<kazim59>	Pici: my ubuntu has been otherwise clean ...
[18:18	<marx2k>	huy: looks like it is installed
[18:18	<Noodlesgc>	mr_wang http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[18:18	<Pici>	kazim59: I'm out of ideas.
[18:18	<x938>	I need food be back later
[18:18	<arpeggi>	No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found. HALP
[18:18	<patrick_>	WanderingKnight: I have tried
[18:18	<Colro>	yeah it's definitely the flash player
[18:18	<philip__>	nickrud: What is the difference between the kernels?   cuz the new one doesn't work well one my pc
[18:18	<Colro>	is there any way to uh, speed it up? :\
[18:18	<jer__>	Question - How can I install a driver for my sound card?
[18:18	<idefixx>	I do like this new failsave mode thing for X but where did my original log go... all the logs I got left are the ones where x starts the failsave
[18:18	<takedown>	navaburo: i know, i dont ask what mesa is
[18:18	<flick>	what can i download and compile to check if the g++ compiler and make are working fine?
[18:18	<patrick_>	but I can't install icon packs
[18:18	<mii1>	how do I open this chat window (using Pidgin) after I close it down ... double clicking the #ubuntu doesn't seem to work ... am I missing something here ^^
[18:18	<patrick_>	it doesn't seem to have an option to do so
[18:18	<raphtee>	huy: thanks.  ill give that a try.
[18:18	<huy>	marx2k:  try startx and tell me the error
[18:18	<x938>	Colro: okay then so you might consider not using flash or installing another version of it
[18:18	<Ertain>	Is the update coming from only a small number of servers?  Or are they spread around the world?
[18:18	<huy>	the (EE) line and the (WW) line
[18:18	<x938>	Colro: flash usually is not unstable but it might be a bad firefox/flash combo make sure you have newest versions of everything
[18:19	<rsfriends>	when i open a windows i cant se the x , _ or square
[18:19	<nickrud>	philip_: probably quite a bit; you can look at the change log in /usr/share/doc/linux-image-* for the gritty details
[18:19	<marx2k>	huy: you mean after I edit xorg.conf to run nvidia instead of nv?
[18:19	<huy>	yep
[18:19	<mr_wang>	I PUT THE CD IN THE tray just now and i see RUn upgrade? do i use that?
[18:19	<MurielGodoi>	hi all,  anyone knows which pachake should i install in ubuntu in order to get rsvg and wnck python modules?
[18:19	<marx2k>	k hang on
[18:19	<MurielGodoi>	s/pachake/package
[18:19	<Ian13>	hey - im not able to upgrade from 7.04 to 7.10
[18:19	<Colro>	x938: I installed the first version of flash google found because Gutsy's flash installer was broken in RC stages, how can I go about removing my current version and reinstalling? ;x
[18:19	<bmidgley>	FWIW: update-manager couldn't find 7.10 until I ran "sudo update-manger -c"
[18:19	<beedan>	How do I enable apt-get to get source?
[18:19	<DShepherd>	how do you change the current gdmgreeter theme from the commandline?
[18:19	<erUSUL>	mr_wang: if it is the alternate cd it is supposed to work that way
[18:19	<eodchop>	apple support channel for ubuntu? Anyone?
[18:20	<nickrud>	mr_wang: that'll work, be sure you're on the net for the stuff that's not on the cd
[18:20	<jer__>	Anyone know how to install a driver I downloaded for my sound card?
[18:20	<kadakas>	My Ubuntu-Server 7.04 boots up very weird: http://www.impact.pri.ee/ul/failid/DSC00041.JPG
[18:20	<kadakas>	It asks for "S3 Login" and then continues on with the usual boot sequence.
[18:20	<kadakas>	I cant log in to this server via LAN, because it seems that its doing things in wrong order - the last process just stays there. It does not ask for the login again
[18:20	<x938>	beedan: "sudo apt-get install source
[18:20	<kazim59>	Pici: I've a strong intuition that Beryl caused this. I'm not using Beryl at all. Can I remove Beryl?
[18:20	<ceed>	do i have to uninstall older version of rTorrent when i want to install a new one?
[18:20	<Jhs>	huy, did you find out anything about the nvidia problem? and do you have the same problem i have, that 2.6.22-14 won't start at all (for me, it freezes during the progress bar screen thingy)
[18:20	<Noodlesgc>	mr_wang gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" after you put the cd in the tray
[18:20	<x938>	ceed: rTorrent should do this itself
[18:20	<Pici>	kazim59: yes, you can.
[18:20	<Dr_willis>	ceed,  thats a feature of the apt package manager system :)
[18:20	<ceed>	x938, i used apt-get install and it installed old version

[18:42	<cousin_luigi>	garu: yes, how is the pcm slider set?
[18:42	<garu>	DShepherd I just installed the livecd, and I got very low sound.dont know why.
[18:42	<ebirtaid>	tsk tsk
[18:42	<jknight>	cwatson: you sure you have a rewritable cd?  that message has been pretty reliable for me ...
[18:42	<garu>	ebirtaid yes i did, but its still low
[18:43	<cwatson>	Kaitlyn2004: is that a GeForce2 MX/MX400 card?
[18:43	<ebirtaid>	pcm and master are both at full?
[18:43	<cousin_luigi>	garu: try alsamixer from console
[18:43	<ebirtaid>	along with speaker volume?
[18:43	<apropos>	garu: I'd guess that you need to go into the mixer and play with a different volume slider, that's what happened to me.
[18:43	<bcardarella>	Does anybody have Gutsy running with an AMD Turion 64 CPU? If so, were there any snags with installation, setup, etc...?
[18:43	<Kaitlyn2004>	cwatson: umm.. not 100% sure.. it's not the newest..
[18:43	<garu>	cousin_luigi In the alsamixer control, the pcm doesnt even have bars
[18:43	<drakoman>	hi guys
[18:43	<nayte>	Hey guys -- I'm trying to run the fglrx driver package I just downloaded from ATI, but apparently I need some packages to "build" the thing.
[18:43	<endo>	I cannot seem to get through the upgrading process to Gutsy, because of the audacious repertory. seems to be down or something. Should I just download the iso, burn and install?
[18:44	<nayte>	Can anyone clue me in as to what those are?
[18:44	<cousin_luigi>	garu: oh..odd
[18:44	<cwatson>	jknight: yes, I've tried 2 types of CD-R(W) and a DVD-RW. also tried with small & large ISOs
[18:44	<Blama>	Hey all, I have a problem with Ubuntu.  I have a USB Compaq Multimedia Keyboard SDM4540UL that does not work in Ubuntu. This keyboard works fine in Windows and works fine in the BiOS menu and the GRUB menu.  If I plug in the keyboard at the Ubuntu command line I get the error, "usb 1-1: device descriptor read/all, error -62".
[18:44	<garu>	apropos different slider?I have only two sliders
[18:44	<cousin_luigi>	garu: are you sure it's not at zero?
[18:44	<nicholas>	endo: disable taht repo temporalily
[18:44	<ebirtaid>	naytea: sudo apt-get install build-essential
[18:44	<rredd4>	using gutsy, when I click on system >	Preferences >	appearances  Visual effects tab, then click on custom, I get desktop effects could not be enabled.  I have geforce 2 go, nvidia acclerated graphics is enabled.  compiz is installed.  what did i miss?
[18:44	<Lamego>	nayte, why don't use use the one provided on the repositories ?
[18:44	<cwatson>	Kaitlyn2004: what does 'lspci' say?
[18:44	<nayte>	ebirtaid, Thanks -- I'll try it.
[18:44	<toupeiro>	wow, I haven't been in an IRC room in probably ten years
[18:44	<apropos>	garu: seems like I had to dig for them...
[18:44	<valmarko>	I don't mean to be boring but I didnt install the new version yet and I'd like to be sure if the application media center has tv capture functionality or i'll have to install tvtime (btw, an excellent program) instead
[18:44	<garu>	cousin_luigi the PCM is at the maximum now...but still no difference
[18:45	<nayte>	Lamego: Well, I'm having another odd issue with that, too. Every time I reboot, those modules get removed from my /lib/modules/$(uname -r) directory.
[18:45	<Kaitlyn2004>	cwatson: oh.. its GeForce 4 MX 420
[18:45	<cousin_luigi>	garu: so is master?
[18:45	<apropos>	endo: I had to burn it, but any extras you had (if it is an upgrade) will still need to be downloaded. torrent is great.
[18:45	<cousin_luigi>	garu: anyway what audio chipset are you using?
[18:45	<nayte>	Lamego: I have to remove the linux-restricted-modules package and then re-install it every time I reboot this POS.
[18:45	<garu>	apropos in the mixer control panel, I got 2 tabs
[18:45	<^Migs^>	what's a good ghosting tool that works well with Ubuntu
[18:45	<endo>	apropos: I have the iso from downloading through torrent. but I would just rather just update through the update manager. I don't have any blank discs kicking around haha
[18:45	<d1n0>	Can anyone help me so I can extend my desktop to my TV? It's connected through S-video and works out of the box as a clone!
[18:45	<apropos>	garu: mine's down at the moment due to upgrade problems, or I could be more helpful, sorry.
[18:45	<cwatson>	Kaitlyn2004: what does 'glxinfo | grep direct' say?
[18:45	<fertas>	hello after starting a fullscreen game my monitor resolution was changed, then I changed it again and ubuntu told me too sign in again after this everytime i start ubuntu it starts in low graphics mode and nothing is working, how can i solve this? (ubuntu 7.10 before everything was working even the cube)
[18:45	<Lamego>	nayte, that is strange, you should look for a solution for that problme insteady of doing a manual gflrx install
[18:45	<garu>	cousin_luigi master is all the way down...I can't even turn it up
[18:46	<apropos>	endo: yeah... that's going to take you a while, the servers are being hammered.

[18:46	<nayte>	Lamego: Really? So the proprietary drivers from ati aren't reccomended?
[18:46	<endo>	no doubt man, alright. i'll try it anyways and wait it out

[18:46	<Lamego>	nayte, the recommended version is the one available on the repositories, unless your graphicals board is not supported, which is not the case

[18:50	<dotjay>	Lamego: do you have any idea regarding the required files iam using gusty
[18:50	<orochi_>	assasukasse, The only way I've found to fix that so far is just to turn effects off while I'm playing a game
[18:50	<rredd4>	Lamego  acclerated graphics driver is installed
[18:50	<cwatson>	rredd4: not working at all? or just no compiz?

[18:50	<PriceChild>	keo92, /topic

[18:50	<cousin_luigi>	garu: you have to add the parameter on /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base

[18:51	<rredd4>	cwatson no desktop effects

[18:51	<toupeiro>	assasukasse>	what kind of game are you trying to go Fullscreen with?
[18:52	<rredd4>	Lamego  isn't that the 3d driver?
[18:52	<tonarp>	how can i make one QoS very simple but powerful in ubuntu ?
[18:52	<cousin_luigi>	garu: yes but you have to unload and reload it with an option
[18:52	<Lamego>	rredd4, yes it is
[18:52	<giany911>	so ... any known issues when upgrading from feisty to gutsy, especially with easy ubuntu, envy ..nvidia drivers ?
[18:52	<danielbw>	Blama: go into the bios and toggle the legacy keyboard option. If it's on tunr it off. if it's off turn it on. maybe that will fix it.
[18:52	<assasukasse>	toupeiro: enemy territory
[18:52	<cwatson>	tonarp: what is QoS?
[18:52	<Vlet>	tonarp: carefully?

[18:53	<ceed>	how do i delete file named "Hellgate London Demo- TorrentLeech" when i rm -r it tells me there is no such directory
[18:53	<toupeiro>	assas>	:) not going to work for you with XGL.  game uses direct openGL rendering.  you have to load a gnome failsafe session
[18:53	<cousin_luigi>	ganesh: not sure... how did that happen?
[18:53	<apropos>	DARKGuy: don't start services you don't need, add RAM
[18:53	<fertas>	after changing something with the resolution ubuntu always starts in low graphics mode, how can i deactivate it?
[18:53	<toupeiro>	assas>	8.41 should fix that
[18:53	<rredd4>	ganesh  sorry.. not a guru here...
[18:53	<HackXP>	I have upgraded from fiesty to gutsy with no problems.  Thanks guys for the hard work. It looks great.

[18:53	<garu>	cousin_luigi I'v opened the file u told me to...complicated file :D
[18:53	<ROBOd>	the screen is black
[18:53	<cwatson>	ceed: have you tried putting quotes around the file name?
[18:53	<Vlet>	DARKGuy: it couldn't find the partition, or it just wasn't able to retrieve your user account and settings from it?
[18:53	<david003>	hello. i'm downloading the ubuntu iso that is meant for cd. can i burn it to a dvd?
[18:53	<assasukasse>	toupeiro: 8.41?
[18:53	<ROBOd>	i have removed the usplash package, and the 'splash' and 'quiet' kernel parameters
[18:53	<assasukasse>	of what?
[18:53	<DARKGuy>	apropos, I'd add RAM but I have no money atm. Where can I know what services are started and/or how to stop/disable them like in msconfig ?
[18:53	<toupeiro>	so from you login, if you click options, and select gnome failsafe and then login, the game will work fine
[18:53	<danielbw>	Blama: No change in behavior?
[18:54	<deejay>	hi all
[18:54	<garu>	rredd4 what exactly says when u try to enable the effects?
[18:54	<cousin_luigi>	garu: then I suggest you avoid tinkering with it:)
[18:54	<toupeiro>	make sure you are using the restricted or a proprietary driver
[18:54	<apropos>	DARKGuy: I think under administration there's a service manager gadget

[18:54	<Vlet>	DARKGuy: oops
[18:54	<assasukasse>	toupeiro: i am using restricted nvidia driver
[18:54	<rredd4>	garu  desktop effects could not be enabled
[18:54	<garu>	cousin_luigi funny thing is, when I was on the livedvd, I had the sound working fine

The block size may be wrong.  Do you want to correct the value or ignore the problem?"  I tried ignoring it but then when trying to install ubuntu it says the disc had an error reading it... what do I do?
[18:54	<Blama>	danielbw, No change at all
[18:54	<Vlet>	barduck: it couldn't find the partition, or it just wasn't able to retrieve your user account and settings from it?
[18:54	<DARKGuy>	apropos, orochi_ : thanks :)
[18:54	<david003>	hello. i'm downloading the ubuntu iso that is meant for cd. can i burn it to a dvd?
[18:54	<kas1>	I can go to appearance preferences screen, but cannot change visual effects from NONE
[18:54	<apropos>	DARKGuy: and if it's video, you can play around with differnt drivers / x servers
[18:55	<cousin_luigi>	ganesh: what if you stop gdm and do a startx from console
[18:55	<cousin_luigi>	?
[18:55	<Vlet>	david003: I don't think so
[18:55	<toupeiro>	assas>	if you're using Nvidia, you shouldn't have to use Xgl.  I read someone say you are using Xgl, is that correct?
[18:55	<rredd4>	garu  i don't know why
[18:55	<Roko1>	Hi all
[18:55	<barduck>	Vlet: if I run GPArted, it finds the partition. But in the isntalled, when I get to "ready to install" it doesn't list anything
[18:55	<cwatson>	orb2: did you check the md5sum after you downloaded the image?
[18:55	<fr500_>	msn messenger down?
[18:55	<shane_>	Is MSN broken in Pidgin for anybody else?
[18:55	<garu>	rredd4 do sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl "assuming ur system is up-to-date"
[18:55	<cousin_luigi>	ganesh: you will have some immediate log
[18:55	<orb2>	cwatson: uh no how do i do that
[18:55	<assasukasse>	toupeiro: geforce2 needs xgl
[18:55	<orochi_>	shane_: Not for me, no
[18:55	<shane_>	fr500_: Heh, I guess so then.
[18:55	<rredd4>	garu  it is
[18:55	<bobbo>	shane_ its not for me
[18:55	<barduck>	Vlet: and according to the screenshots I see, it should say something about Vista in the "Ready to install" screen, no ?
[18:55	<danielbw>	nevermind guys, it looks like i was logged on as the same user under nx and the actual desktop. checking to see if thats the answer
[18:55	<garu>	rredd4 then run the command
[18:56	<cwatson>	orb2: md5sum file.iso
[18:56	<DARKGuy>	apropos, my video is good, the problem is when I do HD-"intensive" stuff (apt-get while browsing web + finding a file in the meanwhile and opening another app) ... the system kinda lags so :p
[18:56	<lavender_dream>	How do I enable Ubuntu so that it plays DVD straight from VLC player and make that as the default multimedia player for all videos?
[18:56	<toupeiro>	ah.  ok, didn't know that :)  well, then I assume you are in the same boat as I am with my X1400
[18:56	<cwatson>	then look at one of the mirrors for what the iso should be
[18:56	<rredd4>	garu  will that override glx?
[18:56	<orb2>	cwatson: I'm not running linux atm... I assume I'd have to run that command in linux
[18:56	<assasukasse>	probably yes
[18:56	<orb2>	cwatson: is there a way to do it in windows?
[18:56	<bobbo>	shane_: its down for me on windows live too
[18:56	<toupeiro>	its an XGL limitation with that game right now as far as I can tell
[18:56	<VagaStorm>	When I try to boot into ubuntu 7.10 I loose the signal til X starts, dosent mater if I change the resolution on the bootup screen
[18:56	<DShepherd>	lavender_dream, right click .. and choose open with tab? something like that
[18:56	<Vlet>	barduck: I don't recall. sorry
[18:56	<garu>	rredd4 it will install it :o
[18:56	<apropos>	DARKGuy: maybe you just have a slow system? There used to be tricks like playing with hdparm DMA settings, but I don't know if they apply for your computer (or under ubuntu)
[18:56	<deejay>	right i've got ubuntu running and i would like to jazz it up a bit, can anyone point me in the right direction for how to get the fancy dock etc???

[18:56	<dotjay>	I have installed gusty in my samsung sV0411N thats was no problem but when i istalled segate which has 4 NTFS partitions they are identified but with an error 'unable to mount'
[18:56	<cousin_luigi>	speaking of which, do you have any idea why my dvd reader stopped playing movies on linux (but not on windows) after I installed an unofficial firmware?
[18:56	<shane_>	bobbo: Oh, okay, that's reassuring. :) Thanks
[18:57	<toupeiro>	if you log in with a failsafe session and type glxinfo | grep direct you wiill see you have direct rendering and the game will work smoothly
[18:57	<apropos>	deejay: enable universe and multiverse, and look around in aptitude.
[18:57	<[Soma]>	hey... when i try to install ubuntu 7.10, i can't even get into the installation. it boots from the CD with a resolution of 720x400 (which would be for widescreens, i assume) and it won't let me change resolution. and since the install window is not resizable, i can't even scroll to the bottom to ever click "okay" anywhere. so i tried to get around by tabbing my way through the windows, but that didn't work out very well. what do i do?!
[18:57	<cousin_luigi>	does libdvdcss access the drive in a different way than windows?
[18:57	<lavender_dream>	DShepherd: It doesn't even have a open with tab in the mounted DVD icon on my desktop. :/
[18:57	<assasukasse>	toupeiro: do u know how can i make 2 gnome sessions? one with xgl and one w/o
[18:57	<deejay>	cheers apropos
[18:57	<orochi_>	Hard drives seem to use the scsi subsystem now even if they're ide, so you might need sdparm instead of hdparm
[18:57	<codecaine>	hi I can get my wireless network card to connect to my wireless router with wep key I can communicate with my other computers on the lan but I can not access websites can anybody help me out? I have a static ip
[18:57	<DShepherd>	lavender_dream, right click .properties... and choose open with tab? something like that
[18:57	<rredd4>	garu I noticed when I did install ccsm  it said something about xgl not being there

[18:58	<deejay>	how di i enable universe etc, where is it?
[18:58	<toupeiro>	you probably can.  If you look up the instructions to setup Xgl on 7.04 you can modify your current sessions file and make a copy of the gnome configuration, omitting the Xgl config
[18:58	<lavender_dream>	DShepherd: Yeah that's what I mean, doesn't have it... I inserted a DVD and it doesn't autoplay in VLC as it should, I tried to open up VLC and play it from there, it just crashes. :/
[18:58	<garu>	rredd4 do this "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"!when ur done, do Ctrl+Alt+BackSpace

[18:59	<apropos>	DARKGuy: it doesn't sound good, ubuntu has always performed better on equivalent hardware for me.

[19:01	<cousin_luigi>	garu: perhaps livecd uses snd-hda-intel model=auto
[19:01	<orb2>	cwatson: so what do I do now, I ran md5sum
[19:01	<apropos>	remix5x: probably, anyway.
[19:01	<DARKGuy>	apropos, GUI/X/graphic interface hangs sometimes (as in, mouse locks up and windows might turn grey when compiz is enabled - to notify something is taking a lot of CPU or waiting for an answer) when I'm doing HD stuff, say.... I run CS 1.6 under WINE... while that loads, I open Swiftfox, then Swiftdove and it starts slowing up until everything loads - not to mention the normal load time when clicking the panel menu because it loads the icons ¬¬;

[19:03	<orb2>	cwatson: okay the hash is different... wtf?
[19:03	<ruz322>	barduck, no guarantees, but im pretty sure grub isnt installed until the ubuntu OS is, that means you wouldnt configure any of that until after

[19:04	<st3v>	Good evening. Is there anyone who experience the same problem i do? I play World of Warcraft on Ubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04 in combination with Wine 0.9.46. It works like a charm except for one thing: the distance drawing isn't nice, it's just a white background which is drawn only when i move to close not equally.. anyone recognize this? and know how to solve it?
[19:04	<macsim>	is it possible to have deskbar in feisty style ( input search on gnome-panel ?)
[19:04	<PovAddict>	I think something wrong wrong

[19:04	<PovAddict>	lol
[19:04	<DARKGuy>	like, right now
[19:04	<huy>	barduck: if you correctly select the free partition, then you should be ine
[19:04	<ruz322>	barduck, as long as you install to the unpartitonied space, then no it wont touch the vista install, and grub will let you configure your bootloader after the install is finished
[19:04	<d1n0>	Can anyone help me so I can extend my desktop to my TV? It's connected through S-video and works out of the box as a clone!
[19:04	<orb2>	cwatson: So what do I do if the md5 hash differs from the one listed on UbuntuHashes???
[19:04	<huy>	barduck: as long as you don't install into vista partition, grub can detects it
[19:04	<demonspork>	how do I use Gparted to format an ntfs partition???  it would do it off the livecd but not on the gutsy install?

[19:04	<d1n0>	Dr_willis, do you know how i can install ati contol panel?

[19:05	<barduck>	ruz322, huy: how do I make absolutely sure it doesn't install on the Vista partition ?
[19:05	<d1n0>	ebirtaid, have you ever done that?
[19:05	<PovAddict>	orb2: if you use bittorrent and point it to the iso you have, it will only download the parts that are wrong
[19:05	<ebirtaid>	nope
[19:05	<barduck>	I mean, what should I look for ?
[19:05	<ruz322>	Sliker_Hawk, pastebin your xorg.conf file
[19:05	<AndrewB>	*Notice* - There is a problem with the MSN servers, it isn't an ubuntu problem.
[19:05	<Sliker_Hawk>	Ok
[19:05	<huy>	in the installer select the partition that doesn't contain vista
[19:05	<ebirtaid>	if you search the forums for your video card and dual display it may help
[19:05	<dotjay>	is there any damn place i could get my self at least answer for my question nobody really seems to respond to anything since morning ive been asking regarding Vmware and NTFS-3g I hardly got any response to the questions if this is t the place place to ask this then where in the world do you want me to ask?
[19:05	<apropos>	barduck: when you partition, it will tell you where it is going to install.

[19:05	<garu>	rredd4 did it work?
[19:05	<ebirtaid>	fn'dotjay: what are you trying to do
[19:05	<huy>	!wubi
[19:05	<ubotu>	wubi is an unofficial Ubuntu installer for Windows users - more info is at http://www.cutlersoftware.com/ubuntusetup/wubi/en-US/index.html

[19:06	<NeoGeo64>	I'm just looking at my marijuana bag in disgust.  I can't believe I'm smoking this stuff.
[19:06	<NullName>	IS it true that you have to manually add a secondary monitor for 7.10????
[19:06	<tehlaser>	I just upgraded to gutsy, and I see a GNOME splash screen with strange washed-out colors after logging into X instead of the Ubuntu-themed one.  Is this normal?
[19:06	<barduck>	huy: I know wuby, but I want 7.10
[19:06	<rredd4>	garu  yes! thanks
[19:06	<Vlet>	b0lland: in ccsm, if you enable desktop cube, it should work, but it will likely only have two panes... in your gnome panel's workspace switcher, increase it to 4
[19:06	<codecaine>	anybody know how to set up a dns server?
[19:06	<ebirtaid>	fn'NeoGeo64: send it to me
[19:06	<PovAddict>	I think I did something wrong when repartitioning... I now have a 98GB NTFS partition, and a totally full 2.04GB ext3 partition (and then the swap); the idea was totally getting rid of that second NTFS partition
[19:06	<NullName>	someone told me that the "secondary monitor" feature won't work unless you manually add it to xorg.cong
[19:06	<NeoGeo64>	I can't even code anymore.
[19:06	<apropos>	codecaine: yes
[19:06	<barduck>	ruz322: if I chose "largest free space" it means it won't touch my Vista ?
[19:06	<NullName>	is this true?
[19:06	<DARKGuy>	apropos, does this helps you help me? xD ->	http://rafb.net/p/nd9ynJ64.html
[19:06	<ruz322>	barduck, yea

[19:06	<garu>	rredd4 no prob!

[19:07	<codecaine>	I try the network configure in gnome but it doesn't let me add it doesn't show up
[19:07	<huy>	barduck, the safest way is to get another harddisk for ubuntu

[19:07	<codecaine>	so I can have access to the network
[19:07	<dotjay>	but i logged thrice since the morning and wasted my time for no good thing only responding to others
[19:07	<apropos>	DARKGuy: the DMA is on, which is the main thing I know about doing to speed up your hard drive.
[19:07	<PovAddict>	codecaine: you dont need to install a dns server for that...

[19:08	<DARKGuy>	apropos, me too and it's enabled in Feisty on my system by default so I didn't worry with Gutsy :p

[19:09	<apropos>	DARKGuy: I get 146MB in 3.04 seconds =  48.04 MB/sec on my notebook
[19:09	<huy>	barduck: usually in the installer it would tell you which partition already have a filesystem
[19:09	<NullName>	is double monitors (both at once) possible in 7.10 with the gui?????
[19:09	<PovAddict>	"Since GParted can be a weapon of mass destruction only root may run it." lol nice wording
[19:09	<huy>	barduck: my best bet is that the one with ntfs is the one with vista
[19:09	<Fant>	mc44:  you still around ?
[19:09	<PovAddict>	sudo or gksudo?
[19:09	<Vlet>	b0lland: and what happens when you hit ctrl-alt-left?

[19:13	<apropos>	DARKGuy: yeah, that's slower than mine, but I don't know if it's enough to make a difference. I'd definitely look at profiling points like CPU, memory, drive throughput, etc in the system monitor
[19:13	<a514>	Hi i just installed Gutsy & GDM is at 1600x & the Desktop at 1280x1024 how do i fix it?!

[19:24	<arghh2d2>	does anyone know what's the average upgrade time upgrading to gutsy through update manager?  or care to share how long it took you personally?
[19:24	<cousin_luigi>	there's even a repo for gutsy
[19:24	<ebirtaid>	the best torrent program is transmission
[19:24	<rredd4>	DJBlack  desktop cd?  when you double click on install, it freezes?  reboot cd and do a check cd integrity test
[19:24	<Vlet>	codecaine: because (on a clean install of gutsy here) I do have one
[19:24	<DJBLaCK>	ok
[19:24	<ubuntu>	PovAddict: I am dualbooting with Windows. Should ext3 be /boot, or /?

[19:25]  * heLLo2U says GUSTY ROCKS!! installing frostwire was a snap!
[19:25	<Vlet>	codecaine: so maybe if you create one and check another machine for it's dns servers, put them in one line at a time as: nameserver x.x.x.x
[19:25	<rryan>	ganesh : I don't know much about ATI ... but which driver do you have enabled ? fglrx ? the open source one?
[19:25	<Lifeisfunny>	cousin_luigi,  Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.   Without the GNOME settings manager running, some preferences may not take effect.

[19:25	<kishan>	danielbw, right click on the panel add items and add battery
[19:25	<cousin_luigi>	deejay: what about another theme?
[19:25	<heLLo2U>	hopefully it works....
[19:26	<arghh2d2>	Does anyones update manager hang on: "Fetching file 15 of 22"?  is that sposed to happen?
[19:26	<silkcom>	is there a way to manually setup graphics drivers?  I'd like to verify that fglrx are indeed the ones that are being used
[19:26	<PovAddict>	arghh2d2: server overload
[19:26	<deejay>	whats frostwire???
[19:26	<heLLo2U>	FROSTWIRE installed.... program is not starting... do i need to restart??
[19:26	<FFighter>	has anyone got problems with Tilda and Gutsy?:
[19:26	<PovAddict>	deejay: a free limewire
[19:26	<dsuch>	For some reason "dpkg -i" (1.13.22) core dumps when I'm trying to install an "alien -k"'ed file. Is that normal or should I perhaps report it somewhere? What do you think?
[19:26	<deejay>	ahhh cool thanx
[19:26	<kishan>	arghh2d2, some times the servers are busy just leave it for a while
[19:26	<codecaine>	yea try to copy my resolv.conf off this pc no sucess
[19:26	<Vlet>	arghh2d2: no, it's not, but it's happening a lot since the relase. try switching mirrors
[19:26	<|neon|>	are there any trevino gutsy repos yet?
[19:26	<codecaine>	when I restarted the service
[19:26	<ubuntu>	one last question, should ext3 be primary, or logical?
[19:26	<A[D]minS>	oooooooooof Gutsy sucks
[19:26	<danielbw>	kishan: I know about that one, but the default one that runs in the "systray" / notification area is a little better
[19:26	<danielbw>	thats the one i am looking for
[19:27	<codecaine>	let me set my router to dhcp real quick
[19:27	<Lifeisfunny>	|neon|, ask in #compiz-fusion
[19:27	<Sitting_Duck>	keo92: Yes, I have. I just tried rryan's suggestion -- the second monitor does appear in nvidia-settings, but I'm having trouble actually activating it.
[19:27	<Lifeisfunny>	he hangs out there
[19:27	<Vlet>	A[D]minS: so don't use it
[19:27	<|neon|>	Lifeisfunny: thx
[19:27	<jhong>	hi, any sparc users here?
[19:27	<ganesh>	rryan:ya i installed it..but in screen and graphics its showing something else..how to knw it exactly?
[19:27	<keo92>	Sitting_Duck : oh
[19:27	<Ronald>	Upgraded server to Gutsy, broke my Imap-ssl:  imapd-ssl: couriertls: connect: error:1408F10B:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number --- openssl s_client doesn't even connect (as it would if things would be alrght) Any clues please ?
[19:27	<Vanders>	I've been trying to upgrade to 7.10 since yesterday, but dist upgrade keeps failing to download a package from wine.lowvoice.nl  Has anyone else seen this problem, or know if there an active bug report for it?
[19:27	<heLLo2U>	frostwire doesnt work.... any other clients in mind????
[19:27	<Vlet>	codecaine: perhaps you also need to take down eth0 and bring it back up after modifying resolv
[19:27	<PovAddict>	*** please for compiz questions go to #compiz-fusion, helps lower the traffic on this channel ***
[19:27	<deejay>	can anyone point me in the direction of a website that can tell me how to pimp my desktop with fanciy docks icons etc???
[19:27	<ubuntu>	(i'm running dualboot) should ext3 be primary, or logical? what should the SWAP file be?
[19:27	<deejay>	can anyone point me in the direction of a website that can tell me how to pimp my desktop with fanciy docks icons etc???
[19:27	<deejay>	can anyone point me in the direction of a website that can tell me how to pimp my desktop with fanciy docks icons etc???
[19:27	<deejay>	can anyone point me in the direction of a website that can tell me how to pimp my desktop with fanciy docks icons etc???
[19:27	<kishan>	well danielbw is the gnome power monitor that manges it u can check that by installing BUM boot up manager and check whter its actived at boot
[19:28	<PovAddict>	Vanders: server overload
[19:28	<Vlet>	deejay: don't do that
[19:28	<Aranel>	my Kubuntu doesn't forgot root password, and it doesn't ask me for password, it always give me permission. How can I disable the "password remember" function ?
[19:28	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : In 'X Server Display Configuration' in nvidia-settings, if you select your second display and hit 'Configure' then select 'TwinView', hit ok, and then try loading it, that should make your second screen turn on
[19:28	<Fant>	Vanders:  sounds like you have a custom 3rd party repository setup ... go remove it and try again
[19:28	<deejay>	why??
[19:28	<dotjay>	deejay screenlets.org
[19:28	<kishan>	deejay, stop flooding and go to www.gnome-looks.org
[19:28	<Vlet>	deejay: because you will get kicked
[19:28	<deejay>	ohhh so sorry
[19:28	<PovAddict>	deejay: dont repeat your question like that or you'll get kicked out pretty quick
[19:28	<|neon|>	dotjay: did you get vmware running
[19:28	<Lifeisfunny>	deejay, try #Ubuntu-effect and ask for AVN
[19:28	<PovAddict>	channel is crowded enough as it is
[19:28	<deejay>	i wont do it again, did not know
[19:28	<[chr0n0s]>	1439 yet

[19:28	<K3nt0>	if any of you remember, i was looking to run live cd from anything but a cd. i went and bought some blanks but broke down and bought some smokes. see what you made me do?!?!
[19:28	<[chr0n0s]>	has it reached 1500 ?
[19:28	<rryan>	ganesh : in your xorg.conf located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf, if in the section labelled 'Device' you see Driver 'fglrx' then you should know that its the fglrx driver
[19:28	<Lifeisfunny>	deejay, sorry #Ubuntu-effects
[19:28	<danielbw>	kishan i have found the answer, thanks!
[19:29	<dotjay>	hey |neon| nice to see you again
[19:29	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: How do I "load" it?
[19:29	<dotjay>	|neon| : but nop
[19:29	<kishan>	danielbw, what is the answer
[19:29	<zerokill>	hi, i think i completely screwed up my pc via grub anybody care to help me out?
[19:29	<danielbw>	it was always running but it was set to not show the icon when not draining or charging
[19:29	<Pici>	Lifeisfunny: the channel no longer exists.
[19:29	<PovAddict>	Vanders: no, I'm just doing a fresh install; but everybody and his sister is getting timeouts installing packages
[19:29]  * ubuntu smacks his head
[19:29	<|neon|>	dotjay: did you try any update patch?
[19:29	<Vanders>	Fant: Spot on the money. Thanks. I feel stupid now :)
[19:29	<danielbw>	kishan: it was always running but it was set to not show the icon when not draining or charging
[19:29	<kishan>	lol danielbw
[19:29	<huXfluX>	I have a laptop with intel HD audio card. The sound is working but the volume level is VERY low (even if alsamix and all mixers have the volumes at MAX. so is the laptop's volume control - at max). What can i do to have louder sound? I'm running Ubuntu GUSTY
[19:29	<Fant>	vanders ... np mate i did it too
[19:29	<Captain_Haddock>	Does anyone know what the ramifications are of closing the dist upgrade adept window during the "installing the upgrades" step? It appears to be stuck.
[19:29	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : err I guess I mean after hitting twinview just select ok, it should ask you if it's ok to restart your X server to make the changes work.
[19:29	<[chr0n0s]>	zerokill: a liitle more explainiation
[19:29	<PovAddict>	Vanders: getting upgrades after a release is quite hard lol
[19:29	<heLLo2U>	how do i get java 1.6????
[19:29	<danielbw>	kishan i changed it to always show the icon ... duh
[19:29	<dotjay>	|neon|: yeah i googled but din get any
[19:29	<Captain_Haddock>	Stuck on "preparing to configure libexpat"
[19:30	<ubuntu>	should ext3 be primary?
[19:30	<cousin_luigi>	huXfluX: is it perhaps an ALC861 too?
[19:30	<danielbw>	kishan: I am not always this stupid
[19:30	<kishan>	danielbw, intall bum its good to control what boots upp
[19:30	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: Oh, so if I restart X, it should work?
[19:30	<Guthix>	So im trying to get ubuntu running on my computer but when i select regular or safe graphics mode at the first screen that comes up my monitor just goes to sleep.... i have a fairly old graphics card (ATI)... any ideas
[19:30	<PovAddict>	ubuntu: unless you already have 3 partitions, yes it should be primary
[19:30	<kristofer>	I'm using a dell d610 with the intel 915GM - I've tried both the intel driver and the i810 driver, but XGL is extremely slow in both cases. help please!
[19:30	<dotjay>	|neon| : try seeing this http://pastebin.ca/742648
[19:30	<danielbw>	kishan, i will!
[19:30	<kristofer>	can I use aiglx instead? can someone point me in the right direction?
[19:30	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : Well it should do it for you... and ask you before it does it. But yea, if you see the two screens in nvidia-settings then that means TwinView should be able to work if you turn it on
[19:30	<huXfluX>	cousin_luigi yes yes !~!!
[19:30	<ganesh>	rryan:/etc/X11/xorg.conf saya permission denied
[19:30	<huXfluX>	and it also has a Si3054 MODEM option cousin_luigi
[19:31	<heLLo2U>	i have SUNJAVA do i need to install java 1.5 or java jre/jdk too????
[19:31	<ubuntu>	PovAddict: I will have 3 partitions. nfts, ext3, and swap. Should my swap be primary as well?
[19:31	<PovAddict>	ubuntu: there is a limit of 4 partitions; making one of them extended lets you add 4 more, splitting one in four, let's say; if you dont plan on having more than 4 partitions, all as primary are fine
[19:31	<ubuntu>	ntfs*
[19:31	<zyberzero>	Hello! I've totally messed up my /var/, i chowned to www-data so i can't access sudo anymore. I just get an error, /var/run/sudo owned by uid 33 should be uid 0. What can i do?
[19:31	<huXfluX>	cousin_luigi what to do ?
[19:31	<kishan>	ganesh use sudo before gedit
[19:31	<keo92>	Sitting_Duck : i think so
[19:31	<danielbw>	kishan: installing bum now.
[19:31	<cousin_luigi>	huXfluX: you need to add an option for the module, and cross your fingers
[19:31	<ubuntu>	PovAddict: awesome, thanks.
[19:31	<Pici>	ganesh: kishan: use gksudo for graphical apps
[19:31	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: I've made all the changes, but it hasn't actually asked me if it can apply them now. I'm going to restart X and hope for the best. Brb.
[19:31	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : And if the settings don't save, you probably need to hit the 'save to X configuration file', which will write it into your xorg.conf, but you need to have nvidia-settings running as root, so you need to run it by typing 'gksudo nvidia-settings'
[19:31	<zerokill>	[chr0n0s]: ive got a 2 sata2 harddrive setup. hda had vista and hdb was supposed to be the ubuntu one. after i made the partitions in hdb i installed grub in the mbr of hda (hd0)
[19:31	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : Did it say TwinView (Requires X Restart)
[19:32	<hendrixski>	is it just me or is there something in Gutsy that hogs the CPU?
[19:32	<PovAddict>	eek
[19:32	<kishan>	pici whats tha difference
[19:32	<zerokill>	after the 1st boot grub hungs with an error 22 and after  couple of tried with error 17
[19:32	<PovAddict>	installer is "analyzing the apt mirror"
[19:32	<bobbo>	hendrixski: just you :S
[19:32	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: I selected TwinView, but it didn't give me that warning
[19:32	<PovAddict>	wonder what mirror
[19:32	<Pici>	!gksudo | kishan
[19:32	<[chr0n0s]>	zerokill: and ... now ?
[19:32	<ubotu>	kishan: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Avoid ever using « sudo <GUI-application>	» - See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo for more info
[19:32	<PovAddict>	it will take ages
[19:32	<danielbw>	PovAddict: make sure synaptic is not running
[19:32	<|neon|>	dotjay: pm me
[19:32	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : ok, that's odd
[19:32	<Fade2Black>	how do i find out of my wireless card is working
[19:32	<Haz>	HI ADURO.
[19:32	<Haz>	NEED HELP
[19:32	<Aduro>	LMAO
[19:32	<Aduro>	Hey Haz.
[19:32	<zerokill>	what i did was to change the sata2 cables and make hda hdb and vise versa
[19:32	<hendrixski>	bobbo, hhmm, because my CPU's hitting 100% ever couple of seconds
[19:32	<PovAddict>	Pici: thanks, i needed to know that too :P
[19:32	<Haz>	;P
[19:32	<hendrixski>	and it's higher than normal
[19:32	<Aduro>	Haz, coming out tommorow?
[19:32	<rryan>	ganesh : you should have read access to your xorg.conf
[19:32	<zerokill>	installed again and all is ok for ubuntu
[19:32	<rryan>	ganesh: as long as you didn't try to write to it it shouldnt have said access denied
[19:32	<Haz>	Aduro: nice support question O_O
=== ubuntu is now known as J-_
[19:32	<danielbw>	PovAddict: also make sure you are not performing an apt-get install or anything that is using the apt database
[19:32	<Haz>	Aduro: and yes.
[19:32	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: Would it make sense to restart X now that I've written a new xorg.conf?
[19:32	<Aduro>	You said Help :<
[19:32	<Aduro>	xD
[19:32	<bobbo>	hendrixski: yeah that is pretty weird, have you tried disabling Compiz?
[19:33	<zerokill>	but the mbr of hdb (now containing vista)
[19:33	<zyberzero>	Hello! I've totally messed up my /var/, i chowned to www-data so i can't access sudo anymore. I just get an error, /var/run/sudo owned by uid 33 should be uid 0. What can i do?
[19:33	<zerokill>	has a broken grub
[19:33	<Guthix>	If my screen goes blank when i boot the install disk normally should i try the alternative install?
[19:33	<PovAddict>	danielbw: I'm doing a fresh install, why would I be installing a package on the livecd?
[19:33	<zerokill>	hence i cant load vista
[19:33	<rryan>	Sitting_duck : if you wrote it to your xorg.conf, then yes it might work
[19:33	<codecaine>	maybe the new distro don't like this wifi card
[19:33	<danielbw>	PovAddict: Also, keep in mind the mirrors and download servers are very taxed right now
[19:33	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: Alright, I'll give it a shot. Back in a sec.
[19:33	<Haz>	Aduro: how did the install go?
[19:33	<zerokill>	2 questions
[19:33	<wckdkl0wn>	i am having a problem with webpages right now.. takes roughly 28 seconds for firefox to resolve a site. also i cant ping an ip in terminal 100% packet loss. this happened before with ubuntu but i went to kde and never had the problem again.. any ideas?
[19:33	<PovAddict>	danielbw: I know that part ;)
[19:33	<Noodlesgc>	g2g
[19:33	<lap_>	compiz-fusion enable by default in gutsy ?
[19:33	<Aduro>	It went fine :D
[19:33	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck: IF it doesnt work I can look at your xorg.conf and see if somethings off
[19:33	<hendrixski>	bobbo, I don't have it running... when I try to enable it ... it simply doesn't start... i don't have a graphics card that would support it
[19:33	<Haz>	good, talk to you in TIRC
[19:33	<danielbw>	PovAddict: i don't know I did because I installed flash so i can check out youtube while my system was installing
[19:33	<[chr0n0s]>	zerokill: do you have vista DVD/CD ?
[19:33	<zerokill>	can i restore vista mbr in hdb ? and if i do that will vista load ok after i manualy changed its mapping?
[19:34	<bobbo>	hendrixski: what specs are you running? Which ubuntu variant?
[19:34	<Ind[y]>	Firefox has ugly fonts after upgrading to Gutsy. Is this a known issue?

[19:34	<cousin_luigi>	Lifeisfunny: no, I'm sorry
[19:35	<Lifeisfunny>	cousin_luigi,  I get this error message at time:  Unable to start the settings manager 'gnome-settings-daemon'.

This could indicate a problem with Bonobo, or a non-GNOME (e.g. KDE) settings manager may already be active and conflicting with the GNOME settings manager.

[19:35	<hendrixski>	bobbo, I just installed Gutsy, on a 4 year old dell, 758 Ram (not a problem) and a 2.4 gigahertz pentium 4.  It wouldn't spike like that in feisty
[19:35	<rryan>	ganesh : how is it coming ?
[19:35	<[chr0n0s]>	zerokill: put the HDD's back the way they were, fix mbr, then reinstall grub
[19:35	<PovAddict>	danielbw: fair enough
[19:35	<kbrosnan>	wckdkl0wn: i would check with your isp to see if there are any problems after rebooting your modem/router

[19:35	<rryan>	ganesh : did you get your xorg.conf ?
[19:35	<hendrixski>	bobbo, oh... is that maybe because of the tick-less kernel?
[19:35	<PovAddict>	danielbw: any way I can check what mirror the installer is trying to use?
[19:35	<bobbo>	hendrixski: that is really odd
[19:35	<LapatiK>	hello, firefox and X crash some times, it do the same with mandriva, so it's hardware:it is : cpu memory or Hd?

[19:43	<arpeggi>	how do i do that? i just don't have any sound with any program
[19:43	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : as far as I can tell, it splits them into two screens when it 'feels' like they should be two screens, two 19" at 1280x1024 should be 2 separate ones, so if you have your metamode line set like that I think it makes the decision to

[19:50	<Dr_willis>	lap_,  no idea.. install it and see.
[19:50	<Erik7000>	I just downloaded ubuntu server 7.10 x64 and when I press Start or install in the first menu it just goes away and the display says "no signal". What could be wrong?
[19:50	<fr0nk>	huh is it normal that the update manager
[19:50	<lavender_dream>	cousin_luigi: no... never
[19:50	<Jimdb>	lap:  go into synaptic package manager and search for emerald.
[19:50	<yrlnry_>	This morning the upgrade manager offered me the chance to upgrade to 7.10, and I declined.  Now I'm ready to do it.  How do I start the automatic upgrade process?
[19:51	<swirv>	I have a problem with my install of Gutsy not seeing the printers on my m$ network.
[19:51	<cousin_luigi>	lavender_dream: it started to show that after I upgraded my dvd firmware
[19:51	<lavender_dream>	cousin_luigi: I'm on a fresh install of 7.10 Gutsy
[19:51	<Jimdb>	lap:  and install it if it is missing.
[19:51	<fr0nk>	wants to remove emerald managerlibgstreamer libquicktime, etc? O_O
[19:51	<cousin_luigi>	lavender_dream: which I plan to toss from the window
[19:51	<annaimkonki>	FROSTWIRE not working... i reconfig java... still not working... need heLp... GUSTY 7.10
[19:51	<elektronik123>	 
[19:51	<elektronik123>	 
[19:51	<Vlet>	Erik7000: is your monitor connected via DVI?
[19:51	<rryan>	ganesh : I'm reading an article back from edgy days (so it may be outdated) that the X200 has issues with desktop effects, and you may need to run XGL instead of X
[19:51	<elektronik123>	 
[19:51	<elektronik123>	 
[19:51	<elektronik123>	 
[19:51	<Erik7000>	Vlet yes
[19:51	<elektronik123>	 
[19:51	<Vlet>	elektronik123: do you want something?
[19:51	<Maarten>	yrlnry_: type so_release_upgrade from a console
[19:51	<lavender_dream>	cousin_luigi: do I need to pick up anything special for VLC to play DVDs? I thought the player already came with codecs and such
[19:51	<Maarten>	as root
[19:51	<yrlnry_>	Maarten: thanks.
[19:51	<Mr>	ok I got gutsy running, is it a good idea to go with the "proprietary Drivers" for my ATI 9600 Pro ?
[19:51	<cousin_luigi>	lavender_dream: yes it should have everything you need
[19:51	<gerro>	Mr: yeah
[19:51	<Mr>	or are there alternatives?
[19:51	<Jimdb>	lol, he's probably a microsoft shill.
[19:52	<Vlet>	Erik7000: I've had issues in the past... if you can, try connecting using a vga cable
[19:52	<Amaranth>	Mr: Not if you want visual effects (compiz)
[19:52	<Mr>	ok
[19:52	<crazy6>	hrm I bet this requires csh or zsh or something
[19:52	<yrlnry_>	Maarten: it has to be a console?  A terminal window won't work?
[19:52	<Mr>	yeah that is what I want
[19:52	<Amaranth>	Mr: Then don't install that
[19:52	<gerro>	Mr: those would give you direct rendering
[19:52	<lavender_dream>	cousin_luigi: that's a shame... I feel like... I'm stuck
[19:52	<dotjay>	|neon| http://pastebin.ca/742675
[19:52	<Dbcoops1231>	Does anyone know why a usb (musical) keyboard is only using USB1.1 and not the USB 2.0 that i see in dev manager?
[19:52	<Mr>	Amaranth so what do I want to do ?
[19:52	<Puaff>	please, is there the vmplayer-package for 7.10?
[19:52	<Amaranth>	Mr: the driver you got by default gives you 3d acceleration and compiz, the restricted driver gives you faster 3d acceleration but no compiz
[19:52	<rryan>	ganesh : can you post your xorg.conf to a pastebin ?
[19:52	<Amaranth>	Puaff: no
[19:52	<ganesh>	rryan:i heard that using XGL is not safe..
[19:52	<Erik7000>	Vlet it's 8800, there's no VGA.. When running safe graphics it doesn't say "no signal" just black
[19:52	<PovAddict>	well, now I have "normal" visual effects
[19:52	<dotjay>	http://pastebin.ca/742675
[19:52	<Maarten>	yrlnry_: terminal window will work just fine :)
[19:52	<Dr_willis>	Dbcoops1231,  a low speed device may not need to be usb2
[19:53	<PovAddict>	I see shadow and some animations, but what I'd really like is antialiased corners
[19:53	<Dr_willis>	Dbcoops1231,  a lot of input devices are that way
[19:53	<CardinalFang>	Dbcoops1231, Well, that's usually because the device speaks only USB1.1.
[19:53	<Dbcoops1231>	dr_willis: it's self powered, and for latency issues, wouldn't it need to be?
[19:53	<Maarten>	yrlnry_: as a matter of fact, I upgraded mine through ssh :P
[19:53	<PovAddict>	is there any theme like "human" but with antialiased rounded corners?
[19:53	<Puaff>	Amaranth, do you know then it will be available?
[19:53	<Amaranth>	PovAddict: That's a metacity thing (we reuse metacity's theme engine)
[19:53	<Mr>	Amaranth so if I install the drivers I wouldn't have the visual effects but I would have faster graphics and if I dont install it its slower but I have the effects?
[19:53	<ste__>	Hi, i have problem with Ubuntu 7.10 and auth LDAP
[19:53	<PurpZeY>	Amaranth: I am most likely going to be helping a friend out with a fresh install and an ATI, you would recommend the proprietary drivers? Are things easier under gutsy? I am still on feisty over here and I want to make sure there isn't anything else I might want to know. . .
[19:53	<lavender_dream>	Anyone know the #1 support/documentation/knowledgebase material for Ubuntu? I'd like to learn honestly... with these sorts of problems I'm having
[19:53	<Vlet>	Erik7000: I dunoh... when I had the problem, I just switched to VGA... you have an nvidia 8800 in a server?
=== Merlin_31 is now known as alcassi
[19:53	<agony>	hi out there, after upgrading from feisty i have lost my dri accel for my intel 945 card :(
[19:53	<Amaranth>	Puaff: Where did you get it? If you got it from canonical's commercial repo it might be available in a month or so
[19:53	<swirv>	Where would be the correct channel to ask about printer support?
=== alcassi is now known as Alcassi
[19:54	<ste__>	I have working Auth LDAP fine but when update to 7.10 this crash
[19:54	<Erik7000>	Erik7000 just temporary, I hadn't any other here right now
[19:54	<yrlnry_>	Maarten: sudo: so_release_upgrade: command not found
[19:54	<|neon|>	dotjay: did you run the   runme.pl  as sudo   i.e. sudo ./runme.pl you first have to run the vmware-install.pl that came with your installation of vmware then run the runme.pl it has to do something with vmnet module not compiling
[19:54	<yrlnry_>	Maarten: and "locate" does not find anything like that either.
[19:54	<Amaranth>	PurpZeY: I would not ever recommend fglrx unless you need it to get 3d acceleration. If the open source driver gives you 3d acceleration use it
[19:54	<PurpZeY>	swirv: Here, unless something changed.
[19:54	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: Huge step forward! It's now definitely two screens. Only issue is, they're positioned incorrectly. The one continues on the far side of the other.
[19:54	<Maarten>	do_release_upgrade - with a d not an s :P
[19:54	<yrlnry_>	do-release-upgrade, perhaps?
[19:54	<ganesh>	rryan:http://pastebin.org/5343
[19:54	<kahrytan>	WHy does gparted take forever to scan devices? by forever, i mean it's been scanning for several minutes and nothing
[19:54	<lwizardl>	how do I get stereo sound to work in 7.10 I have a nforce board and all i'm getting is mono (right speaker only works)
[19:54	<yrlnry_>	Aha, thanks.
[19:54	<Fade2Black>	is there anyway to test my wificard to see if its installed correctly
[19:54	<Puaff>	Amaranth, yes, I would like to use the distro package (if possible) I will have to wait
[19:55	<PovAddict>	whoa, I can change font rendering without restarting apps
[19:55	<jessie^^>	grrr this stupid key configuration thing is driving me NUTS
[19:55	<PurpZeY>	Amaranth: So, avoid restricted if possible...But if I can't get direct rendering, then go the other route?
[19:55	<Mr>	Amaranth so if I install the drivers I wouldn't have the visual effects but I would have faster graphics and if I dont install it its slower but I have the effects?
[19:55	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : Ah, ok good. You can specify that with another command : On the line before metamodes
[19:55	<PovAddict>	KDE didn't let me do that last time I tried (long ago)
[19:55	<Dbcoops1231>	lwizard, laptop or desktop
[19:55	<Puaff>	Amaranth, thx a lot for your help
[19:55	<PurpZeY>	Fade2Black: lspci should list it, if it is
[19:55	<lwizardl>	desktop
[19:55	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck:  Option "TwinViewOrientation" "LeftOf"
[19:55	<Jimdb>	kahrytan:  it should not...it should take a couple seconds
[19:55	<kahrytan>	hey Amaranth
[19:55	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : If LeftOf is wrong, try RightOf
[19:55	<Amaranth>	lwizardl: run alsamixer and see if the left side is muted (left 0 is not lit up)
[19:55	<kahrytan>	Jimdb, I know but it's taking forever
[19:55	<Sitting_Duck>	rryan: Will do! Thanks.
[19:55	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : one or the other will make it switch
[19:55	<Amaranth>	hey kahrytan
[19:55	<Jimdb>	kahrytan:  i would say reboot with a power off
=== JmiXIII is now known as Jmi-mange
[19:56	<dotjay>	|neon| ofcourse i did please see this http://pastebin.ca/742675
[19:56	<Jimdb>	kahrytan:  if using usb drives power them off and back on before restarting.

[19:56	<ganesh>	rryan:http://pastebin.org/5343
[19:56	<sidewalk>	without reinstalling?
[19:56	<yrlnry_>	Maarten: NP, I figured it out.
[19:56	<rryan>	ganesh : looking at it now
[19:56	<aioobe>	hi! I'm having trouble with my tomcat installation. I installed tomcat5.5 (+ the webpage / admin packets). Then I sudo /etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 start    nothing happens!  127.0.0.1:8080 gives nothing

[19:57	<acomer>	sidewalk: I heard yes last night
[19:57	<Maarten>	yes there is a torrent, yes you can install from a cd and do a upgrade. :)
[19:57	<crazy6>	man I am going to have to tear through this cryptic script line by line arent I
[19:57	<Dbcoops1231>	i don't suppose there is a linux multimedia studio channel, or maybe someone here who could quickly explain how to use a midi (actually usb) keyboard
[19:57	<pppoe_dude>	sidewalk, but almost definitely no if you use live CD
[19:57	<Fade2Black>	oh crap i had wireless switch off on my laptop i feel real stupid right about now
[19:57	<kahrytan>	gparted is worthless. in gutsy. doesnt work.
[19:57	<kokoko1>	Vlet, is this the live cd or text base installation iso?
[19:57	<pppoe_dude>	although im not really certain, sidewalk

[19:58	<rryan>	ganesh : OK ... under Section "Module" at the end, add a line that says     Load  "fglrx"
[19:58	<erUSUL>	!doesntwork | kahrytan
[19:58	<ubotu>	kahrytan: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[19:58	<lwizardl>	Amaranth, what is the left called ? i see stuff like <master>	<master m>	etc
[19:58	<Amaranth>	lwizardl: no no, under those

[19:59	<Alien18>	when i play any of my video files (mpg/avi) i get green vertical lines and no image, what am i doing wrong?
[19:59	<crazy6>	I guess the mirrors are down/slow because everyone is madly upgrading to 7.10 ?
[19:59	<PovAddict>	I set visual effects to "extra" and I have wobbly windows and stuff
[19:59	<Jimdb>	kahrytan:  in gutsy, yes, gparted has problems.  when I go to mount a drive that won't mount through fstab and I slect the mount option, it will terminate gparted...but it does mount hte partition.
[19:59	<kokoko1>	Vlet, man this # is too fast hard to keep up with the chat :-s
[19:59	<PovAddict>	but how do I get to the details of compiz config?

[19:59	<janga>	I bought a amsung Notebook today and installed Gutsy. Brightness Control doesnt work. What can I do?

[20:00	<dotjay>	Alien18: you installed the required codecs?
[20:00	<PovAddict>	thx erUSUL
[20:00	<Alien18>	i got the ubuntu-restrited-extras pack
[20:00	<rryan>	ganesh : K, now you need to restart your X server, you can do this by closing all open programs then hitting CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE or from the terminal sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[20:00	<tech404>	so i hear that Automatix makes ubuntu great... any feelings guys
[20:01	<jessie^^>	janga: do you mean the brightness control applet?
[20:01	<Mr>	Amaranth: I ran it, the desktop went blank for a while and then it went back to normal but I cant tell a difference... is that good or bad? ^^
[20:01	<swirv>	Ubuntu is already great.
[20:01	<tuplanolla>	tech404: NO, do not use automatix
[20:01	<Vlet>	tech404: I hear it #@&^%@ up y'er system :)
[20:01	<dotjay>	Alien18: which package did you install after that
[20:01	<kd7swh>	running screen in color would help me id file permissions a lot quicker
[20:01	<ganesh>	rryan:ok i ll do that now..
[20:01	<janga>	jessie^^, both the applet and the keys dont work
[20:01	<kokoko1>	Vlet, they call the text base install cd "Alternate install CD" ?

[20:02	<swirv>	tech404: Ubuntu is already great.  Automatix is old-school. do not use it.
[20:02	<Amaranth>	Mr: press Super-E and see if something happens (click on a desktop to get back to it)

[20:03	<Amaranth>	Mr: For that go to #compiz-fusion
[20:04	<rryan>	ganesh : now type glxinfo and does it say 'direct rendering'
[20:04	<Amaranth>	Mr: We just do "make it work" stuff here, not configuration
[20:04	<Mr>	Amaranth thanks for all the help!
[20:04	<lavender_dream>	erm... trying to install dvd codec for totem, I get "Package libdvdcss2 is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source"

[20:04	<rryan>	ganesh err does it say direct rendering yes
[20:04	<Sliker_Hawk>	After enabling the nVidia drivers in the restricted drivers manager (I have an nVidia GeForce 6600) and reconfiguring xorg.conf, I'm still stuck in 800x600. I'm sure I had Feisty working properly by now..

[20:04	<fjleon>	hey guys, i have a ntfs partition and a linux partition on one hard drive. how can i resize the ntfs partition? i dont get the resize option in the installer
[20:04	<dotjay>	Alien18: it is auto and can be seen as soon as you enable the restricted uinverse and multiverse
[20:04	<Vlet>	kd7swh: yeah, same for me... hmm
[20:04	<fjleon>	i made a mistake and the linux partition is only 4 gb
[20:05	<janga>	PurpZeY, ok, i try.
[20:05	<rryan>	fjleon : there's a tool named ntfsresize
[20:05	<mehdi2>	I've changed fonts hinting but didn't help much
[20:05	<meta-paonia>	fjleon - resizing doesn't work in ntfs - you should backup the drive and reformat
[20:05	<kd7swh>	fjleon: use partition magic in windows, or gparted in Ubuntu disk
[20:05	<rryan>	fjleon : you can get it from the 'ntfsprogs' package
[20:05	<fjleon>	rryan: can i run it from the live cd? is it safe?
[20:05	<ravencoder>	i installed the xorg-driver-fglrx from teh ubuntu repos again and enabled it in the restriced drivers but if i run fglrxinfo it still says mesa
[20:05	<nonewmsgs>	i downloaded gutsy and the md5 is right in the iso but ive burned it twice and i keep getting (the same) wrnog md5 on the burned discs.  the first one i burned at 40x and the second at 8x
[20:05	<swirv>	gparted works great.
[20:05	<ganesh>	rryan:direct rendering NO....
[20:05	<Dr_willis>	fjleon,  thers a 'gparted live cd' thats a MUST have for your Pc toolbox. :)
[20:05	<fjleon>	meta-paonia: tell that to the ubuntu installer, it resized my ntfs partition just fine, but i messed up on the size of it
[20:05	<kd7swh>	fjleon: if using vista, vista can resize it too
=== kucka is now known as bobe_gv
[20:06	<rryan>	fjleon : you shoudl be able to. On the safety issue, I wouldn't do an ntfs resize on a partition I would die if I lost..  the software could have a problem with your specific setup, but I have done it and ti worked off a livecd

[20:21	<jessie^^>	Unknown^: sudo apt-get build-essential
[20:21	<silent>	jessie^^, can you customize them outside of compiz?
[20:21	<zkjellberg>	Question: When I use rdesktop and use the condition '-f', I get full screen and it refuses to let me out of it. CTR+ALT ENTER just flash a white screen then go straight back to it. I've reinstalled rdesktop through the package manager and still no change. Rdesktop works perfectly fine doing everything else. (Without '-f' it will do ctr+alt enter maximize/minimise.
[20:21	<akorn>	Alien18: haha nice
[20:21	<atiredmachine>	Evanlec, actually, it begins to install and then gives the error: "Loading Realtime Linux Security Module: not found
[20:21	<atiredmachine>	"
[20:21	<rryan>	ganesh : So nvidia has similar problems when you install the Ubuntu version of nvidia's driver, and then install a newer version from nvidia's site.  Have you only installed the FGLRX driver from the ubuntu repositories ?
[20:21	<rryan>	amitry : ok that's new enough that it should work
[20:21	<rryan>	amitry : odd
[20:21	<gandalf84>	i need to shut down X server, but if i use Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, appair the graphical logon screen, how can i shut down it too?
[20:21	<Unknown^>	then wot?
[20:21	<Unknown^>	jessie
[20:21	<Unknown^>	try again
[20:21	<Unknown^>	?
[20:21	<jessie^^>	silent: sure, using the gnome edit hotkeys in System ->	Preferences ->	Keyboard Shortcuts
[20:21	<Evanlec>	atiredmachine, welll the servers are all backd up right now, maybe thats why

[20:22	<Unknown^>	can i query u jessie
[20:22	<Dr_willis>	gandalf84,  why do you need to shut it down?  stop the gdm or kdm service if you really nee dto.
[20:22	<ganesh>	rryan:i dont remember..bcs i installed long back..
[20:22	<gandalf84>	i want to install nvidia 8800 drivers
[20:22	<deejay>	i downloaded themes via SPM but dont know where they downloaded to???
[20:22	<jessie^^>	Unknown^: only if you do not use less than six words per line
[20:22	<rryan>	Unknown^ : try sudo apt-get install libc6-dev build-essential
[20:22	<Vlet>	DJ_Danni: If I understand correctly, you've got a port being blocked? You need to open that port using iptables.
[20:22	<Dr_willis>	gandalf84,  i dident ahve to shut it down to isntall them for my 8800gts, i just used the restricted-manager tool
[20:22	<DJ_Danni>	no
[20:22	<rryan>	ganesh : Ok... well in that case I really should just say you should find someone who knows the ATI drivers well :)
[20:23	<amitry>	rryan: i tried the failsafe xorg.conf switching it out vesa for nivdia and it would fail, tried the same switching out nv for nvidia, no luck
[20:23	<Dr_willis>	gandalf84,  i do NOT use the drivers from the nvidia site. i use the ones from the repos.
[20:23	<Vlet>	DJ_Danni: Well, I didn't really understand what your problem is. Can be be a little more clear?
[20:23	<DJ_Danni>	vlet i have no firewall at my server but for somreason yp.shoutcast.com say that i have firewall on
[20:23	<rryan>	amitry : are you using the driver from Ubuntu, or the driver from Nvidia's site ?

[20:23	<petafile>	how do you ignore compiz-fusion blacklists in gutsy?
[20:24	<rryan>	amitry :  ok... hmm  so when you have nvidia set as the driver, have you checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see if tehre are error messages ?
[20:24	<jessie^^>	silent:  i've looked at that.  there's something in compiz that's using that hotkey, becuase i can use my other hotkey and it will work.
[20:24	<Gribok>	gigabytes, use torrent - much faster
[20:24	<PriceChild>	petafile, #compiz-fusion
[20:24	<askand>	When ubuntu complains about "batterycapacity", what is it that is bad with my battery?
[20:24	<Dr_willis>	torent for the isos is amazingly fast right now.

[20:24	<gigabytes>	Gribok: actually I wanted to upgrade via Synaptic
[20:24	<deejay>	i downloaded themes via SPM but dont know where they downloaded to???
[20:24	<qanw>	is there I way I can download certain packages to fesity versions after an upgrade to gutsy?
[20:24	<PriceChild>	askand, you can only recharge a battery so many times until its full capacity drops.
[20:24	<Gribok>	gigabytes, I
[20:24	<askand>	PurpZeY:  measured in what?
[20:24	<Unknown^>	i have a synaptic manager
[20:24	<Unknown^>	lol

[20:25	<Dr_willis>	deejay,  a theme for what?  whats 'via spm' even mean?
[20:25	<askand>	PriceChild: what is the capacity measured in?
[20:25	<PurpZeY>	askand: I apologize I was just kidding and I shouldn't b/c the channel is really busy.
[20:25	<rryan>	ganesh : I will, and if you happen to figure out what was wrong, please let me know if you see me. I'm curious
[20:25	<Vlet>	DJ_Danni: are you behind a router or anything like that?
[20:25	<SveinT>	ubuntu can't find my second harddrive and complains about ata xfermode errors...any idea what could be wrong? worked with feisty
[20:25	<gandalf84>	Dr_willis, which driver u use? where u got them?
[20:25	<therethinker>	what is the msft font package, I forget it...

[20:25	<therethinker>	beerfan: thanks ;-)
[20:25	<deejay>	a theme downloaded from synaptic package manager (SPM) ???
[20:25	<Dr_willis>	gandalf84,  for the 8th time.. I used the ones in the ubuntu repositories.. I installed them with the 'restricted-manager' tool.
[20:25	<ganesh>	rryan..sure..can u give me ur mail id?mine is 1ganeshhegde1@gmail.com
[20:26	<rryan>	Unknown^  : you said you were getting the error  'c compiler cannot generate executables'
[20:26	<jessie^^>	okay, i take that back. it's not that it doesn't work-- it's specifically that any shortcut key i use won't open a terminal. awesome
[20:26	<Unknown^>	yes
[20:26	<Unknown^>	i did
[20:26	<rryan>	Unknown^ : that's generally indicative that you dont have libc6-dev installed
[20:26	<Vlet>	DJ_Danni: a router is kind of like a firewall in the sense that if you are behind one, no one can directly access your computer
[20:26	<rryan>	ganesh : rryan@mit.edu is my email

[20:29	<Vlet>	DJ_Danni: it's not just about having them open, you need to make it so when someone tries to connect to your IP on port 1234, your router forwards that request to your computer who's IP is likely 192.168.1.100

[20:31	<PrimoTurbo>	How would I automount a windows partition under Gutsy? I tried putting stuff under fstab but Gutsy seems to ignore that.....
[20:31	<jdong>	askand: 6000mAh is probably the max capacity of their battery, probaby just misread the number

[20:31	<jdong>	Vlet: well technically amp-hours is not sufficient to determine capacity of a battery, but since we're talking about laptops we assume a voltage :)
[20:31	<askand>	jdong: yes its the max..and now its down to 864 mAh...
[20:31	<rryan>	amitry : oh btw, are you on 7.10 ?

[20:33	<jessie^^>	argh
[20:33	<jdong>	askand: is your battery old or dying? 6000mAh should last you several hours

[20:33	<amitry>	rryan:yes, i was running fine on fiesty with an old ati card
[20:33	<jdong>	askand: what is the last full capacity that GNOME Power Manager reports?
[20:33	<Ag0ny>	Kristofer: same thing here, works fine as root
[20:33	<Dan2552>	my battery is 4400mAh and it lasts 1.3 hours
[20:33	<rryan>	Unknown^:  I assume you're compiling from source...  so if you typed ./configure, when that's done, you should type 'make' and then if everything worked, try 'sudo make install'

[20:33	<askand>	jdong: the last full is 864.. the design capacity is 6000
[20:34	<Dan2552>	jdong: a X1600
[20:34	<Unknown^>	rryan : thanks
[20:34	<Ag0ny>	yes from the console
[20:34	<NeoGeo64>	Someone explain... how do I install Ubuntu 7.10 without a CD?
[20:34	<jdong>	askand: the battery is next to dead then
[20:34	<basse_>	what is the compiz plugin called with which u can drag an area of the screen with a key + mousebutton and have the screen zoom there
[20:34	<Ind[y]>	Firefox doesn't use msttcorefonts. How can I make it use them?
[20:34	<Evanlec>	Unknown^, okay just makin sure u did that first
[20:34	<jdong>	Dan2552: do you run the fglrx drivers?
[20:34	<Unknown^>	rryan : btw
[20:34	<Unknown^>	rryan : its umm
[20:34	<ny00123>	NeoGeo64, have you already got Feisty?
[20:34	<Ag0ny>	kristofer: but only for testing...
[20:34	<Dan2552>	i'm running whatever the proprietry drivers thing auto installed
[20:34	<domagoj>	Can somebody tell me how to make php copy function work - it says "permission denied", I heard that I need SSH, so how to enable that (i am beginner with linux)
[20:34	<Unknown^>	rryan : make instal not sudo make install ;)
[20:34	<Evanlec>	basse_, zoom ...
[20:34	<Vlet>	juanbond: check out http://www.gnome-dock.org/trac/wiki
[20:34	<[Thom]>	How can I get ahold of a sample email server log?
[20:34	<jdong>	Dan2552: are you aware of the aticonfig --set-powerstate command?
[20:34	<alromaithi>	i fixed it now by googleing , i just want to ask i did this step https://www.opendns.com/start/ubuntu.php  does this meanthe dns will be locked forever and working ??
[20:34	<Dan2552>	no
[20:34	<basse_>	Evanlec, cant find that stuff in zoom
[20:34	<jdong>	Dan2552: it clocks down or up your graphics card, allowing you to get up to another 2hr of battery
[20:34	<Ind[y]>	Firefox doesn't use msttcorefonts. How can I make it use them?
[20:34	<kristofer>	Ag0ny, if it works for root it should work.. can you get widescreen resolutions to work?
[20:34	<MaxL>	hey guys, I just bought a new graphics card but it's a different brand then what I originally had, how do I uninstall the ATI driverS?
[20:34	<askand>	jdong:  yep..and if ubuntu complained about "low capacity" when it was new it was probably next to dead then too?
[20:35	<Dan2552>	nice. Windows got 2 hours max for me
[20:35	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: try the Mozilla firefox and not the ubuntu version
[20:35	<jdong>	Dan2552: "aticonfig --lsp" gets all available states, use "aticonfig --set-powerstate 1" to set powestatate to lowest
[20:35	<ny00123>	Ind[y], Edit ==>	Preferences ==>	Content
[20:35	<cwkaya>	today someone gave me a link for getting java to work on amd64 but it didnt help, anyone got another sollution ? and also the next java release would be 64 "capable" ( sorry didnt find the correct word :p ) when is that going to be released ?
[20:35	<Ind[y]>	ny00123: then what?
[20:35	<rryan>	Unknown^ : Actually :) if you run make install and it installs it somewhere outside of your home directory (which it usually does) it will need permissions, so you should type 'sudo make install' to let it install itself on your system
[20:35	<tatters>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41225/
[20:35	<Ag0ny>	kristerfer: yes works fine as root 1280x800
[20:35	<ny00123>	Ind[y], look at the list box of the font
[20:35	<rryan>	Unknown^ : when they say 'make install' they assume you are going to run it as root, sudo makes it run as root
[20:35	<kristofer>	cool, I'm gonna try it
[20:35	<jdong>	askand: Ubuntu goes by the information that the battery reports, and in your case you have less than 20% original capcity...
[20:35	<ny00123>	you may also try "Advanced"
[20:35	<ny00123>	for more font settings
[20:35	<Yarcanox>	my sound system is stuck. I stopped the alsa-utils and timidity and started only the first one again after a few seconds, while no media player was running, and it didn't help. the sound just stopped while playing a wav-file
[20:36	<jdong>	askand: sometimes new batteries do not properly report capacities until you drain and recharge them 2 or 3 times
[20:36	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: I use the "firefox" package. Should I use the "mozilla-firefox" instead?
[20:36	<domagoj>	SSH problem - can somebody help me?
[20:36	<jdong>	Ind[y]: same thing :)
[20:36	<Ag0ny>	kristofer: but i won't run my X as root for daily work
[20:36	<Dan2552>	but still, is there anti aliasing settings for desktop effects?
[20:36	<MiguelAngel>	Hello. I need some help please.
[20:36	<Ind[y]>	ny00123: This is not the problem.
[20:36	<ny00123>	Ind[y] I think that one of the packages redirects to the other
[20:36	<Vlet>	!as MiguelAngel
[20:36	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about as miguelangel - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[20:36	<askand>	 jdong:  ok..but anyway..time to buy a new one now right? :)
[20:36	<kl4m>	domagoj: ask and we'll see
[20:36	<Vlet>	!ask | MiguelAngel
[20:36	<jdong>	askand: it is indeed :)
[20:36	<ubotu>	MiguelAngel: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[20:36	<numus>	anyone use gutsy that knows how to install compiz if i uninstalled it
[20:36	<kristofer>	Ag0ny, right me either.. but it's worth a shot
[20:36	<jdong>	askand: how long have you had your current battery?
[20:36	<askand>	 jdong: thank you for your time
[20:36	<Yarcanox>	when trying to start timidity again (as a daemon), I get "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave". it seems like alsa is trashed somehow. this is NOT the first time I experience this. a restart fixed it everytime it happened, but I guess there's a way without a long and disgusting reboot
[20:36	<kl4m>	domagoj: If it's really complex you could ask on #openssh too
[20:36	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: I don't know, it was just a thought. If the webpage specifies a font and you have it firefox should use it. If you want it to use a specific font for generic font families though (like "serif") you need to configure that
[20:37	<domagoj>	 I need to use PHP copy function but it says its denied - I heard that you need SSH for that (i am beginner with linux)
[20:37	<Dan2552>	jdong: Error: Unable to obtain POWERplay information.
[20:37	<askand>	 jdong: 5 months..or something
[20:37	<ny00123>	that is Ind[y], Edit ==>	Preferences ==>	Content
[20:37	<askand>	 jdong: It must have been bad from the beginning..or I really need to learn how to take care of batterys
[20:37	<jdong>	Dan2552: running an Xgl server?
[20:37	<Vlet>	numus: sudo apt-get install compiz perhaps?
[20:37	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: I want it to be exactly like it was in Feisty.
[20:37	<ny00123>	(to change font; "Advanced" has more settings)
[20:37	<MiguelAngel>	I am trying to update to ubuntu 7.10 from 7.04 and have an error.
[20:37	<Unknown^>	rryan : to get into root i type sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev that line has a sudo in it so it should be fine.
[20:37	<jdong>	askand: hmm, 5mo is a very very abnormal lifetime for a modern laptop battery
[20:37	<ny00123>	numus and Vlet, better try out compizfusion
[20:37	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: no idea what that means
[20:37	<ny00123>	should be enabled by default if installed the stable release of Gutsy
[20:37	<cwkaya>	anyone ?
[20:38	<rryan>	Unknown^ : But then, after that line is done you aren't root anymore :) You can tell because your prompt still has $ instead of #
[20:38	<ny00123>	or at least installed by default
[20:38	<jdong>	askand: make sure you don't run it down to empty too much, or expose it to heat, or leave the battery at full capacity for more than 2 days at a time.
[20:38	<Dan2552>	jdong: i don't know if i'm using an XGL server, I'm a bit of a linux newbie to be rather honest - i'm using the default desktop effects which i got working using the ATI tutorial
[20:38	<swirv>	I just got of the phone with RICOH and they say no drivers for their Gelsprinter for Linux for six months!!
[20:38	<Vlet>	ny00123: I don't think that's actually a current package name
[20:38	<Dr_willis>	jdong,  or even use the thing? :) gesh...
[20:38	<rryan>	Unknown^ : if you want to execute a series of actions as root, you can type sudo -i to enter interactive mode, you should see a '#' at your prompt which means you are root
[20:38	<Unknown^>	oh ok
[20:38	<Yarcanox>	I tried totem, vlc and flash, they are all unable to play sounds. as I said, the sound stopped while playing a wav-file in totem, I haven't done anything special. this has already happened, and a reboot fixed it. restarting alsa-utils doesn't help, stopping it and timidity and starting only alsa-utils does also not work; timidity prompts the following message when I try to start it again while the alsa-utils are running again:  "ALSA lib p
[20:38	<Yarcanox>	cm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave"
[20:38	<askand>	jdong: Leave it at full capacity means "charging" for two days?
[20:38	<PriceChild>	rryan, please don't suggest that in this channel
[20:38	<MiguelAngel>	Can someone help me?
[20:38	<jdong>	Dr_willis: not using it leads to battery death. using it too much leads to battery death. there's no winning this race :D
[20:38	<PriceChild>	!sudo | Unknown^
[20:38	<ubotu>	Unknown^: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[20:38	<PriceChild>	MiguelAngel, ask your question
[20:38	<jdong>	askand: right; that's usually bad practice for li-ions
[20:38	<Unknown^>	rryan: so i should type sudo make install
[20:38	<ubuntuchick>	i think im going to give up on ubuntu :(
[20:39	<Gigi>	Hi!  Can someone give me a hand with wine?  I'm trying to install photoshop.  I did it correctly but when it loads I receive an error
[20:39	<Vlet>	!ask | MiguelAngel
[20:39	<ubotu>	MiguelAngel: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[20:39	<jdong>	Dan2552: do DISPLAY=:0 aticonfig ......
[20:39	<swirv>	Yarconox: totem also gives me buggy audio playback.  I use VLC and everything plays fine.
[20:39	<askand>	jdong: Ok..and try to not fully discharge it? Hope my next better will live longer :)
[20:39	<rryan>	Unknown^ : Yes that will work
[20:39	<Dr_willis>	jdong,  and its amazing how GOOD my cell phone battery is.. or my car battery.. it lasted me 7 yrs.
[20:39	<ny00123>	Vlet yeah I see..in contrary to "mozilla-thunderbird" which does exist as a (temporary) package name
[20:39	<MiguelAngel>	When upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10
[20:39	<jdong>	Dan2552: you would be running Xgl, which "hides" the ATI driver interfaces :)
[20:39	<Deformation>	can i get some help please?
[20:39	<Unknown^>	ok rryan
[20:39	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: In Feisty there was no such problem.
[20:39	<Yarcanox>	swirf: <Yarcanox>	I tried totem, vlc and flash, they are all unable to play sounds
[20:39	<Unknown^>	thanks rryan
[20:39	<rryan>	PriceChild : Fine. But I don't subscribe to treating users like idiots.
[20:39	<MiguelAngel>	I have an error with dpkg
[20:39	<Vlet>	Gigi: what error?
[20:39	<rryan>	Unknown^: You're welcome
[20:39	<PriceChild>	rryan, ubuntu uses sudo, not root.
[20:39	<jdong>	askand: right, avoid draining it to flat if possible.... preferably stop at 30%
[20:39	<corpsicle>	how do i make ubuntu NOT try and autoconfigure my graphics card and monitor at every boot ?
[20:39	<kahrytan>	How do I make a ext53 partition mountable by  users instead of root?
[20:39	<ubuntuchick>	my soundcard worked in feisty but now no sound in gutsy
[20:39	<Xargo>	anyone has problems with his wireless keyboard at ubuntu login, and fixed it?
[20:39	<swirv>	ubuntuchick: what is your boggle?  we'd like to help.
[20:39	<Unknown^>	LOL rryan
[20:39	<Unknown^>	it still download rryan
[20:39	<PriceChild>	rryan, we do that for a reason. "/msg ubotu sudo" if you want to know the reasons.
[20:39	<ubuntuchick>	^
[20:39	<Yarcanox>	anybody has an idea??
[20:39	<askand>	 jdong: ok thanks for the tips!
[20:39	<rryan>	PriceChild : sudo -i is  interactive mode
[20:40	<jdong>	Dr_willis: well, car batteries are of different chemistry, and cellphones tend to be low-usage devices
[20:40	<Unknown^>	rryan my internet speed is about 9 kb / sec
[20:40	<jdong>	askand: sure thing
[20:40	<Yarcanox>	should I repeat my question?
[20:40	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: I haven't seen any font issues in gutsy firefox and I've been using it for some time
[20:40	<PriceChild>	rryan, it gives a root terminal... something we don't advise. its basically su.
[20:40	<rryan>	PriceChild : It's not like I'm suggesting typing sudo bash, or adding sudo bash to your .bashrc
[20:40	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: it's unclear what your issue is
[20:40	<MiguelAngel>	Can't configure some packages
[20:40	<swirv>	ubuntuchick : what soundcard do you have?
[20:40	<jdong>	Dr_willis: if you drain a car battery to the point that you need to jump-start the car, it's basically a brick.
[20:40	<Dan2552>	jdong: display=:0 aticonfig --lsp               //////           Error: Unable to obtain POWERplay information.

[20:40	<cwatson>	Has anyone gotten the GeForce 2 MX/MX 400 working in Gutsy?
[20:41	<Gigi>	Vlet, the error says, "Unable to continue because of a hardware or system error. Sorry, but this error is unrecoverable
[20:41	<cox377>	does anyone know what the default out of the box wifi apps is coz i kinda need to revert back to default
[20:41	<Dan2552>	jdong: ah silly thing, i liked windows being non-case sensitive...
[20:41	<Vlet>	Yarcanox: it helps to repeat (within reason), but if you get no answers, it's likely because either no one knows or because you're not asking a specific enough question.
[20:41	<jdong>	Dan2552: lol :D
[20:41	<Dr_willis>	kahrytan,  mountable? or read/writeable? theres the 'user and users' option. for the first.
[20:41	<cwatson>	with hardware accelleration of course
[20:41	<kahrytan>	Dr_willis,  both.
[20:41	<Ballena>	can I make my / -partition larger whitout problems?
[20:41	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: Anyway. How can I switch to firefox of mozilla, and not of Ubuntu?
[20:41	<Gigi>	Vlet  the error says, "Unable to continue because of a hardware or system error. Sorry, but this error is unrecoverable
[20:41	<Yarcanox>	Vlet nobody tells me what information is missing, so I can't help

[20:41	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: download the linux build of firefox from mozilla.com and extract to /opt/firefox
[20:41	<Dr_willis>	kahrytan,  as for writeing you need to chown the directories ON the hard drive.   as far as i know. Not sure of a way to override the filesystem permissions
[20:41	<Vlet>	Gigi: Is the error comoing from photoshop, or from wine?
[20:41	<Dan2552>	jdong: it has three options, thanks
[20:42	<ubuntuchick>	i think its my also
[20:42	<Unknown^>	rryan dont u want it to be in the home directory?

[20:42	<Deformation>	can anyone help me please? my fan does not stop spinning and i feel my labtop is burnning
[20:42	<kahrytan>	dr_kabuto,  then you dont know how.
[20:42	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: This was not necessary in Feisty.
[20:42	<swirv>	ubuntuchick: hmm.. dell usualy has very good support for linux. especialy Ubuntu.  Lemme do some looking around....
[20:42	<Yarcanox>	deformation better turn it off and check your hardware
[20:42	<cwatson>	Deformation: what type of laptop do you have?
[20:42	<psyjoniz>	deformation: shut it down and let it cool off
[20:42	<anotherone>	how can i know my ubuntu version?
[20:42	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: it probably isn't necessary now
[20:42	<Unknown^>	rryan yah cool thankz
[20:42	<MiguelAngel>	I have an error like yours polapo
[20:42	<Dr_willis>	kahrytan,  for a extra storage drive.  i normally format it ext3, then make a dir for the user. and chown that dir to be owned by that specific user.
[20:42	<rryan>	Unknown^ : Generally when you are compiling applications from source, you want them to install themselves into a standard POSIX location for storing applications. Most apps will want to install themselves into /usr/local/bin when you type 'make install'
[20:42	<jdong>	Dan2552: you'll find the lowest one gives you a tremendous batterylife boost
[20:42	<Deformation>	acer travel mate
[20:42	<cwkaya>	guess ill just ask again :d : today someone gave me a link for getting java to work on amd64 but it didnt help, anyone got another sollution ? and also the next java release would be 64 "capable" ( sorry didnt find the correct word :p ) when is that going to be released ?
[20:42	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: The problem is simple. Firefox acts, as I have not installed msttcorefonts.
[20:42	<jdong>	Dan2552: the middle one is virtually identical to the highest one
[20:42	<Gigi>	Vlet if I boot photoshop from the windows drive, it boots correctly, but I can do almost nothing.  So I tried to emule it but seems to not be working... it;s Photoshop CS2
[20:43	<Yarcanox>	My sound stopped. I tried totem, vlc and flash, they are all unable to play sounds. as I said, the sound stopped while playing a wav-file in totem, I haven't done anything special. this has already happened, and a reboot fixed it.
[20:43	<psyjoniz>	deformation: what model?  i have one too
[20:43	<Xargo>	can you connect ubuntu to a windows network?
[20:43	<lap_>	someone know how can I use emerald-themes in gutsy ?
[20:43	<Deformation>	4 years old, 1.5 ghz 256 ram
[20:43	<Yarcanox>	restarting alsa-utils doesn't help, stopping it and timidity and starting only alsa-utils does also not work; timidity prompts the following message when I try to start it again while the alsa-utils are running again:  "ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:864:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave"
[20:43	<cwatson>	Deformation: is the acpi stuff installed?
[20:43	<Deformation>	its a 292lci
[20:43	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: have you restarted firefox since you installed the fonts?
[20:43	<lap_>	i want my beryl-emerald-themes back
[20:43	<rryan>	Unknown^ : If a program installs itself into /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin, etc.. then it will be in your path so you can type its name to run the program wherever you are
[20:43	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: yes
[20:43	<psyjoniz>	deformation:  after a while, my fan started going all the time
[20:43	<Dr_willis>	Xargo,  yes. You can browse the 'network neighborhood' shares easially enough
[20:43	<Deformation>	i really dont know
[20:43	<psyjoniz>	and got really hot
[20:43	<lap_>	like in feisty
[20:43	<Deformation>	i just upgraded from feisty
[20:43	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: what url?
[20:43	<Dan2552>	jdong: i'll give it a try. Also ubuntu works out time remaining on my battery - and my battery doesnt even have a hardware counter :) amazing
[20:43	<Unknown^>	rryan : so like i could type
[20:43	<Deformation>	and it started with gutsy
[20:43	<neopsyche>	How do i format a disk on linux?>
[20:43	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: every
[20:43	<Dr_willis>	Xargo,  read up on 'samba' for more in depth ussage.
[20:43	<anotherone>	how can i know my ubuntu version?
[20:44	<Unknown^>	rryan : Unreal3.2.6/Unreal3.2 in stead of cd Unreal3.2.6/Unreal3.2
[20:44	<MiguelAngel>	So... any idea?
[20:44	<psyjoniz>	you might have something running heavy, do you know how to check your processes for that kindof thing?
[20:44	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: I can't help you if you're oblique. "not working" doesn't tell me anything
[20:44	<Deformation>	psyjoniz, so what you did about that?
[20:44	<fredeferfui>	why is my browser with gutsy very slow?
[20:44	<kahrytan>	Dr_willis,  if a partition is mounted as root, it is writable only as root
[20:44	<Xargo>	k, thanks
[20:44	<jdong>	Dan2552: amazing how much hardware makers skimp these days, no? :)
[20:44	<neopsyche>	How do i format a disk on lnux?
[20:44	<cwkaya>	fredeferfui : ipv6 disable it
[20:44	<DJ_Danni>	vlet i have all ports open at my Routher and the firewall is odd
[20:44	<|neon|>	iplist does not install on ggggutsy because of libnfnetlink1 any suggestions
[20:44	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: I told you the problem. I think I am clear. Firefox works as though msttcorefotns were not there.
[20:44	<psyjoniz>	heh - i took the laptop apart, took the fan out and lubed the bearing so it wouldn't be so loud :D
[20:44	<beerfan>	neopsyche: use the partition editor
[20:44	<yotux>	are ubuntu servers bogged down today?
[20:44	<Dr_willis>	kahrytan,  you need to chown a directory ON the partition. then the users can acess that directory. I dont know of a way to  make the 'root' of the drive user accessable.
[20:44	<Vlet>	Gigi: found the answer :) http://tinyurl.com/yvc62t
[20:44	<Unknown^>	rryan :
[20:44	<Unknown^>	rryan : that right?
[20:45	<neopsyche>	beerfan: is there a sudo command?
[20:45	<neosix>	Hello!!! Does anybody play Wolf. Enemy Territory? I have problem, my server list is empty. Can anybody help me?
[20:45	<Yarcanox>	hey I just got information from someone that this seems to be a familiar bug of ubuntu, as it happened to him too
[20:45	<rryan>	Unknown^ : well, its more like, if you have a program called 'foo' and its installed in your home directory, you have to be in your home directory to be able to say ./foo to run it.. but if you add it to your path somewhere, you can then type 'foo' anywhere and it will run
[20:45	<Yarcanox>	and it didn't happen on suse
[20:45	<Gigi>	Vlet awesome!!!  Thanks a lot!  I'll take a look
[20:45	<kahrytan>	Dr_willis, no i dont
[20:45	<fredeferfui>	cwkaya: how do i
[20:45	<Yarcanox>	so the sound-thing seems to be something that needs to be fixed!

[20:46	<kahrytan>	Dr_willis,  you dont know anything so stop
[20:46	<rryan>	Unknown^ : so if the program name was Unreal3.2, after you type 'sudo make install' it will install itself into /usr/local/bin/Unreal3.2 or something ike that, so then you could just type Unreal3.2 no matter where you are
[20:46	<MiguelAngel>	Necesito ayuda en cualquier idioma por favor. I need help in any language plese.
[20:46	<rryan>	Unknown^ : So, you mean you compiled it with 'make' in your home directory ?
[20:46	<Vlet>	Gigi: glad to help... like most problems, a minute or so of google and patience finds the answer :)
[20:46	<DJ_Danni>	vlet theyre open in the routher not forwarded
[20:47	<swirv>	ubuntuchick: It looks like an ALSA issue with the SigmaTel chip...

[20:48	<|neon|>	iplist does not install on ggggutsy because of libnfnetlink1 any suggestions
[20:48	<rryan>	Unknown^  : At that point you've just 'built' the program, you haven't installed it.   Once you type 'sudo make install'  you can delete the folder from your home directory (the one with the source code, etc) because it will have copied itself into your computers programs area in /usr/local

[20:48	<dave>	hey now
[20:48	<psyjoniz>	deformation: you need to first check your processes - then make sure that the laptop's fan's intake and output are not blocked - beyond that i'm not sure i have enough to help you out
[20:48	<beerfan>	neopsyche: or install gparted and run it if you need to format a secondary partition
[20:49	<Dr_willis>	kahrytan,   there is the 'user' and 'users' options for that. If those change the permissions. Im not sure.
[20:49	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: I can see some MS fonts there, yes.

[20:51	<_4a42_>	ubuntu-ryan: had to tweak compiz once i got in front of the box but once you turn off the pointless stuff its actually an improvement
[20:51	<Yarcanox>	so alsa or the program/driver that alsa uses has crashed somehow
[20:51	<ubuntuchick>	sorry im such a noobn
[20:51	<aaro1>	hearsdriver: you'll have to do some local admin work to repair in this instance I fear
[20:51	<ubuntu-ryan>	_4a42_: cool, i figured Id have to tweak/turn off compiz anyway
[20:51	<beerfan>	Ind[y]: you set "serif" to Verdana or some ms font? find a web page that uses either serif or that font
[20:51	<Fade2Black>	is there anyone here thats good with install and making wireless card work?

[20:53	<seamus7>	i have a dell and it's great
[20:53	<askand>	Dan2552:  yes..but is the..hmm..batteryhealth affected? Is air a good way to take care of a battery or it doesnt care?
[20:53	<psyjoniz>	deformation:  ok - take a look around and see if there isn't anything nailing your processor(s) and/or memory
[20:53	<psyjoniz>	mostly the processor, though
[20:53	<kyled185>	hey I just installed 7.10 on an old dell workstation, it has an ATI rage 128.  Every time I boot, the status lights on my monitor blink and I get  nothing on screen.  X is running and if I ctrl+alt+backspace it restarts and gdm comes up like normal.  Any ideas on how to fix?
[20:53	<ubuntu-ryan>	askand: if the cpu is cooler, the fan runs slower, which should equal more battery life
[20:54	<yasper>	I have  dell xps m1710
[20:54	<Deformation>	psyjoniz, nothing, my cpu is below 5%
[20:54	<Dr_willis>	askand,  heat is bad :)
[20:54	<Wil1>	do i install from boot or what?
[20:54	<ubuntu-ryan>	askand: assuming laptop cooler isnt running from USB power
[20:54	<bro>	Wil1: open update manager and click the "upgrade" button
[20:54	<Wil1>	how does it work for upgrading?
[20:54	<rryan>	hearsedriver : hmm I can't remember if it drops you to root if you boot in rescue mode...  if it does, then you can just re-add yourself as admin, otherwise you could boot with a livecd and manually edit your /etc/group file
[20:54	<Wil1>	ahh thanks so much bro
[20:54	<Ind[y]>	beerfan: Actually, when I had Feisty, Gmail was renderred differently than on Windows. I installed msttcorefonts and Gmail was renderred like in WIndows.

[20:56	<KeithWeisshar>	why am i experinging long wait at 82% of installation while scanning the mirror
[20:56	<Vlet>	Adam__: there is a client. It's already installed in the 'internet' menu
[20:56	<Beastlykings>	How do I mount a linux HDD from a live cd after a crash?
[20:56	<rryan>	hearsedriver : Ok.. hmm, USB thumb drive :) ?    Anyhow... I imagine there's a kernel option that drops you to a root shell, I just can't remember it
[20:57	<kahrytan>	src,  try again with  non-geek lang
[20:57	<ubuntuchick>	oh i found it
[20:57	<ubuntuchick>	just the generic ones i guess
[20:57	<aaro1>	kyled185: Make sure you are giving time for the OS to load. Also try moving the mouse and/or hitting a few keys on the keyboard. I installed 7.10 on an older Dell just a few hours ago and had to move the mouse before I could see the login. It was like it turned the monitor off immediately after X started
[20:57	<KeithWeisshar>	my ubuntu install got stuck at scanning the mirror
[20:57	<bro>	hi guys. i was wondering, is there any way to make filenames shorter in ubuntu [gutsy]? they seem too long for me, 2-3 lines. something with (...) just like on xp would be awsome.
[20:57	<KeithWeisshar>	i'm installing into virtualbox
[20:57	<Dan2552>	bro: what filenames?
[20:57	<yonkeltron>	sleep on my thinkpad is broken in gutsy
[20:57	<Unknown^>	rryan : whats the command again to get it i want to right it down
[20:57	<Unknown^>	rryan ?
[20:57	<fjleon>	KeithWeisshar: it doesn't get stuck, just wait for 5-10 minutes
[20:57	<src>	kahrytan, do a google search for /etc/fstab and do some quality reading. you'll gonna figure it out :)
[20:57	<Deformation>	psyjoniz: i am double booting with xp, let me test it on xp and come back here, hold on here dont go please ok?
[20:57	<psyjoniz>	deformation: unfortunately we've already burned through the easy explanations.  other's might include processes that read/write to your HD often as that will heat your laptop up pretty quick, too

[20:59	<ben__>	goddamn, GIMP makes simple things hard. It's almost comical trying to lower the brightness of a photo if you're not a digital artist. Like using quantum mechanics to calculate your groceries

[20:59	<rryan>	Unknown^:  gotcha

[21:10	<haru>	Psi-Jack, i mean permanently..
[21:10	<kyled185>	brainiac8008, you can probably just restart X (ctrl+alt_backspace)
[21:10	<puli>	pike i have done that
[21:10	<Psi-Jack>	Dr_willis: Hmm. I've heard of pmount before.
[21:10	<puli>	what else should i do
[21:10	<pike_>	brainiac8008: you can install stuff same as hd install only diff is that it wont be there next boot
[21:10	<pppoe_dude>	try pressing ctrl-alt-backspace after finishing the install, that should restart graphics for ya, brainiac8008
[21:10	<Psi-Jack>	haru: Does mplayer have a configuration file it reads? ;)

[21:11	<PriceChild>	Joanki123, do you know how much ram you have? Most modern/semi-old machines should have no problems with it
[21:11	<Deformation>	psyjoniz: this thing only happned after the upgrade
[21:11	<psyjoniz>	there must be something in gutsy telling it to go high on the fan

[21:11	<nonix4>	emmajane: I'll make a policy for myself to never install a non-LVM system again ;)

[21:12	<pppoe_dude>	yokomo, although i personally recommend just encypting folders with gpg
[21:12	<kahrytan>	Dr_willis, you need to familiarize yourself with http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=283131
[21:12	<therethinker>	dedalus: some are down
[21:12	<Deformation>	psyjoniz: should i enable powernowd process? its off
[21:12	<Dr_willis>	cobus,  normally you boot to windows and have windows check the partition, OR theres a ntfsfix command taht 'might' fix it.
[21:12	<pppoe_dude>	brainiac8008, yes

[21:13	<psyjoniz>	that is really strange
[21:13	<nonix4>	emmajane: dunno, the next step is figuring out which fdisk variants actually work... fdisk doesn't.

[21:19	<NullName>	pppoe_dude: if the screen is blinking can I use it to just run a shell/terminal?
[21:19	<oklopol>	i'm doing /dev/dsp, where can i see/change the frequency of it? sorry for repasting this over and over, but i'm not sure how else to force you to answer ;)
[21:19	<Unknown^>	sorry
[21:19	<Alien18>	pppoe_dude. how do i command line start a vid please?
[21:19	<Bsims>	I intend to update via the alternate cd and then update the rest once the mirrors cool down any issues anyone sees with this?
[21:19	<omega_>	if i have installed the ccg compiler where i found it
[21:19	<lax>	"The name of the launcher is not set"....
[21:19	<hovinen>	Okay, I just tried it from archive.ubuntu.com and it worked. So there is a problem with some mirrors, including ca.archive.ubuntu.com
[21:20	<pppoe_dude>	Alien18, mplayer -vo xv /path/to/file

[21:20	<bofh80>	hi people. can you tell me if this gnunet stuff is installed by default? i've been through a few distro upgrades, and this thing is causing my problems, can i safely remove it? i've read up on it, but the information is well, rather broad.
[21:20	<pike_>	miir: 1) plug in drive 2) dmesg | tail  3) if it said like sda or whatever or sdb 4) sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb   is basic answer
[21:20	<Alien18>	thnx
[21:20	<astro76>	Bsims, that's fine, if you do that, the rest of the updates from the net might be small enough to do now
[21:20]  * Psi-Jack sighs./
[21:20	<Vlet>	omega_: you mean, gcc, right? you should be able to, from any terminal, just run it as 'gcc'
[21:20	<emmajane>	miir: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Flash-Memory-HOWTO/ It might not be the easiest tutorial, but I was the tech editor on it and I can vouch for its accuracy. :)
[21:20	<omega_>	yes
[21:20	<novanosis>	who is able to explain why I cannon run OPENGL in WINE on CS 1.6 without it laggin, workes fine in software mode
[21:20	<pppoe_dude>	Alien18, without the -vo xv to see what is actually happening originally
[21:20	<Psi-Jack>	So, nobody here uses CUPS to print in ubuntu 7.10? ;)
[21:20	<pike_>	miir: there is also a disk mounter in gnome menu which is easier i guess
[21:20	<bee_>	Psi-Jack, yes I got it working earlier today
[21:20	<Bsims>	astro76: Heh I found a mirror for the alternate that gave me 900+kps

[21:20	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, what are you actually trying to print?
[21:20	<bofh80>	novanosis, can't you set it to use DirectX ?
[21:20	<alromaithi>	guys i just installed fresh gutsy accidently i installed emerald when i could change the decoration through applications >	other >	window decoration :( please help should i remove emerald and is emerald good to keep???

[21:21	<ubuntuchick>	hey guys
[21:21	<ubuntuchick>	no luck with my sound
[21:21	<parsek>	anyone have a problem with nvidia binary drivers? mine is always going back to vesa 640*480
[21:21	<pppoe_dude>	NullName, i think so, just back up a copy of your xord.conf and try it out
[21:21	<rdavila>	Hi friends!
[21:21	<bee_>	Psi-Jack, I use cups-pdf a lot.
[21:21	<novanosis>	bofh80: I dont know how?
[21:21	<Psi-Jack>	bee_: Did you have any problems with Unsupported format 'application/postscript'!?
[21:21	<ubuntuchick>	could it be because im in livecd?
[21:21	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, perhaps you are using the wrong driver?
[21:21	<oklopol>	i'm doing /dev/dsp, where can i see/change the frequency of it?
[21:21	<Deformation>	psyjoniz: i will be here, you are my only hope!!
[21:21	<oklopol>	or do i need a separate program?=
[21:21	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: Nope. It detected the Z600 just fine.
[21:21	<bofh80>	novanosis, i'm sure where you choose OPENGL or Software mode you can select DirectX
[21:21	<rdavila>	is there any way to install in text modo a "Desktop Edition" of ubuntu?
[21:21	<psyjoniz>	1,441 ppl might disagree ;)
[21:21	<omega_>	<Vlet>but when i want to configure the apache always tell me i don't haved
[21:21	<novanosis>	bofh80: i will give it a try i will return
[21:22	<googlah>	rdavila, just press esc at the boot screen
[21:22	<warbisshop>	Anyone here exprience slow boot in ubuntu 7.10, my feisty didnt have this problem
[21:22	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: I'm getting Unsupported format 'application/postscript'!, when I try to print. Had to use the web interface to get that actual error message.
[21:22	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, what does "echo hello world | lp" give?
[21:22	<CheesyMonkey>	Is there a way to stop the window manager defaulting to compiz/visual effects at startup and back to metacity?
[21:22	<bofh80>	warbisshop, out of interest, do you have a wireless device?
[21:22	<warbisshop>	ye
[21:22	<warbisshop>	its on my laptop
[21:22	<mon^rch>	whats the command to purge my apt cache so it forces a download from the repo please?
[21:22	<warbisshop>	but my desktop doesnt have this problem :(
[21:22	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: Unsupported format 'application/postscript'!
[21:22	<Psi-Jack>	Err
[21:22	<Ba-ow>	hello
[21:22	<lap_>	there's a way to use emerald-themes in gutsy ?
[21:22	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: lp: Error - no default destination available.
[21:23	<Tigerman>	hello
[21:23	<lap_>	to use emerald-themes like beryl does
[21:23	<rdavila>	googlah, is this the same as "alternate edition"?
[21:23	<Vlet>	CheesyMonkey: in the appearance contro panel, select 'none' on the visual effects tab
[21:23	<bofh80>	warbisshop, oh see, how long does it take to boot? and what wireless card is it?
[21:23	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, which one the first or the second?
[21:23	<omega_>	ok how i can renew the Path?
[21:23	<pike_>	warbisshop: hit esc at bootup then at grub menu hit 'e' to edit then at kernel line hit e to edit again and remove the quiet splash hit enter and then b to boot at least then you will see what it is slow doing make note of that during boot
[21:23	<PurpZeY>	mon^rch: apt-cache update, I believe.
[21:23	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: The non-default, second one. ;)
[21:23	<googlah>	rdavila, i guess so, not sure though :/
[21:23	<CheesyMonkey>	Vlet, Its already selected. but when i login im left borderless,
[21:23	<bofh80>	can anyone here confirm if GNUNET-DAEMON is part of the DEFAULT install ? do i NEED it for anything? i installed a lot of crap, i don't know if this was one of them
[21:23	<Enki>	Hi all.  I have a question about printer setup with IPP.  When I try to set up a print using IPP, after entering the hostname and clicking "Find Queue", I just get a neverending "Scanning" message in the IPP Browser window.  Is there a particular format I should use for the address I enter?
[21:23	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, are you using a custom driver?
[21:23	<pike_>	warbisshop: that is temp it will not effect any setting and when you reboot nothing is chanced
[21:24	<pike_>	changed
[21:24	<rdavila>	ok, very thanks googlah ;)
[21:24	<computerex>	Is there a way to activate the sound file previews in Gutsy?
[21:24	<Ba-ow>	hello
[21:24	<hasse>	i have a ace archive containing 80 files, when i try to extract it, it stops at file.c40 i have tried with 4 different archives, same story, anyone ?
[21:24	<Alien18>	pppoe_dude, both times (with and without) i get vertical yellow lines
[21:24	<googlah>	rdavila, not a problem, try it out :)
[21:24	<lap_>	there's a way to use emerald-themes in gutsy ?
[21:24	<lap_>	to use emerald-themes like beryl does
[21:24	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: Nope. Dude. This is like, out-of-the-box install on CUPS. Nothing fancy. The Z600 was auto-detected, and I checked, it's using the right driver. That much I can see. ;)
[21:24	<bofh80>	pike_, thanks for the advice, i can use that to solve the problem on my little bro's pc :D
[21:24	<Alien18>	pppoe_dude, no picture
[21:24	<pppoe_dude>	Alien18, what about mplayer -vo sdl /file
[21:24	<Vesuro>	Hi all, I'm paranoid about what I'm trying to do, so if anyone could help me out I'd *really* appreciate it - I'm looking for the easiest way to shrink my Linux partition, create an NTFS partition and install XP on the NTFS partition. I want to know how to keep my Linux partition bootable after this since Windows likes to overwrite the MBR. Any ideas?
[21:24	<warbisshop>	when i let it boot like normal it takes about 5 mins
[21:24	<warbisshop>	when i press ctrl alt F1 it works a lot faster
[21:25	<kiru>	my xwindows crashes regularly by turning the screen into black
[21:25	<Tigerman>	do you guys have similar problems with Firefox on Gutsy? when you press the 'launch web browser' on your multimedia keyboard... does your homepage gets opened or file:///home/user (like by me)   ???
[21:25	<Alien18>	pppoe_dude, same
[21:25	<kiru>	i have to run this script to fix it http://nopaste.info/7057a9ceda.html
[21:25	<warbisshop>	in a minute -2 i'm booted up
[21:25	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, sounds like a bug
[21:25	<LifeSF>	Hi, I was wondering,.... I have Ubuntu server 7.10 and did apt-get install ubuntu-desktop to get my gui installed and it didn't work well at first and had to redo the apt-get and update about 5 times for it to finish... now it's finally started going through the install process and now it's been frozen at: Reloading system log daemon for over and hour.... is this normal?
[21:25	<Xera>	Has the ATI support/drivers been improved in 7.10?
[21:25	<pppoe_dude>	Alien18, what video card are you using?
[21:25	<kiru>	does anybody know how to overcome the problem?
[21:25	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: request id is Z600_Series-1 (1 file(s))
[21:25	<maksim>	так лучше?
[21:25	<Alien18>	nvidia
[21:25	<computerex>	Is there a way to get sound previews in Gutsy like in Edgy or Fawn?
[21:25	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: That's after I set lp -d Z600_Series. :)
[21:25	<kiru>	because it is quite unconvenient to reboot in repair mode to run this script each time i log off
[21:25	<maksim>	ау
[21:25	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, did it print?
[21:25	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: Yeah, bug, what I'm thinking,
[21:26	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: Waiting to see..
[21:26	<bofh80>	Vesuro,   System >	Administration >	Partition editor  for the pariutions
[21:26	<novanosis>	oh my word, now I checked to see if there is a selection for directX and all I saw was OPENGL,SOFTWARE,D3D. I tried D3D and now when I open CS it takes me back to my login screen for ubuntu
[21:26	<puli>	pike it says it succeeded
[21:26	<ds1>	jesus
[21:26	<puli>	whshould i do?at
[21:26	<Reng>	hey guys i have a 1tb external drive and im using linux. should i format it to FAT or just leave it as NTFS?
[21:26	<ds1>	i didn't know that ubuntu needed internet connection to install o_o
[21:26	<Jesus>	ds1, yes?
[21:26	<puli>	pike can i close the terminal now?
[21:26	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: It went through the queue, and is no longer there. But no print. LOL
[21:26	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, on ubuntu, lp should automatically have the default printer setup (unless you don't have the Z600 set as your default in cups, perhaps)
[21:26	<ds1>	and now it's stuck on 82% with scanning the mirror
[21:26	<ds1>	o_O
[21:26	<Alien18>	pppoe_dude, its nvidia, not sure of the model
[21:26	<bofh80>	Vesuro, the boot sector thing is quite bad yes, i'm sure there's a simple way to fix that afterwards using the Ubuntu Live CD >	but someone else here should clarify a simple way to rewrite the MBR
[21:26	<pppoe_dude>	!nvidia | Alien18
[21:26	<ubotu>	Alien18: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

[21:27	<warbisshop>	bofh80 takesa bout 5 mins and its an intel wireless card
[21:27	<Xera>	novanosis, D3D is Direct3D

[21:27	<novanosis>	oh my word, now I checked to see if there is a selection for directX and all I saw was OPENGL,SOFTWARE,D3D. I tried D3D and now when I open CS it takes me back to my login screen for ubuntu
[21:27	<Xera>	D3D is a Windows thing, you should select OpenGL or Software..
[21:27	<pppoe_dude>	Alien18, and / or stick around and get someone else to help you coz i have no experience with nvidia
[21:27	<bofh80>	warbisshop, did you see pike_ 's information?
[21:27	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: I don't have any printer set default. I didn't want to, until it was tested. But Ubuntu install did not set the default, either, apparently.
[21:27	<ds1>	no help
[21:27	<bofh80>	novanosis, ouch
[21:27	<parsek>	hi all, anyone succeeded using nvidia binary drivers with 7.10?

[21:28	<novanosis>	I cannot select anything now everytime I try to get in cs it takes me back to the login of ubuntu, any help please?
[21:28	<bofh80>	warbisshop, cool. let us know what you find :)

[21:28	<Xera>	novanosis, delete your CS config file
[21:28	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, i'm out of ideas, perhaps check /var/log/cups?
[21:28	<CosmosX>	hello, i am trying to repair a ubuntu install. my friend created a new user account and used the home from the only one user that existed... since she had done that, it is impossible to use the sudo command.
[21:28	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: Already did. No errors. LOL
[21:28	<pike_>	puli: yes
[21:28	<bofh80>	warbisshop, thanks for the information about the system. i have a pci belkin pci card in my bros' pc and it takes ages to boot ubuntu
[21:28	<puli>	pike can i close that window now?
[21:28	<Tigerman>	HELP
[21:28	<Tigerman>	am i invisible or something?
[21:28	<pike_>	puli: that should be it. a reboot also would have worked but that is a little drastic :)
[21:28	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, although if the lp command went through with no errors, then the document should have prined
[21:29	<pppoe_dude>	Psi-Jack, you sure the printer is plugged in?
[21:29	<Tigerman>	do you guys have the same problem with Firefox on Ubuntu 7.10? when you press the 'launch web browser' button on your multimedia keyboard... does your homepage gets opened (like google) or 'file:///home/user' opens (like by me)   ???
[21:29	<pike_>	puli: you should be all set
[21:29	<CosmosX>	Tigerman,  no your not
[21:29	<aro>	Tigerman, see how many people are asking questoins?
[21:29	<puli>	thanks pike i am happy to read my newspaper now
[21:29	<aro>	There are 1431 people in this channel man
[21:29	<Vlet>	Tigerman: if you get no answer, that usually means no one here has an answer for you, or you're not being specific enough
[21:29	<puli>	cooooooooooooooooooooooooooool pike
[21:29	<Psi-Jack>	pppoe_dude: If it wasn't plugged in, it wouldn't have been detected during install of Ubuntu. *chuckles* But yeah, I just reached up and hit the power button on it, and it came on,. ;)
[21:29	<Tigerman>	okay let me be more specific
[21:29	<bofh80>	Tigerman, ROFLMAO :D
[21:29	<pike_>	Tigerman: thats a firefox setting for homepage

[21:30	<pike_>	puli: hope you stick with ubuntu :)  that command just rereads the fonts installed to build the cache  the cache is what ubuntu actually uses  windows is the same
[21:30	<Tigerman>	pike_, my homepage in forefox is google
[21:30	<parsek>	after the installation, do you guys suggest first to upgrade the system and load the NVIDIA drivers or the other way?

[21:45	<Rabiddog>	 gnome-themes-extras <---- anyone know why this package is hold in gutsy? Anyone know if its suppsed to be held by apt?
[21:45	<novanosis>	this search you told me i should enter it into the terminal correct ? apt-cache search
[21:45	<bofh80>	Tominator, i seem to find the adapters name choice varies lol, so yes wlan0 is an equivient. if you are not sure you can use dmesg to see what's being assigned to what
[21:46	<masticore>	I get these errors when I try "sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv" http://upload.dibon.net/files/1121/screenshot.png http://upload.dibon.net/files/1122/screenshot2.png How can I fix this?
[21:46	<googlah>	god, i love ubuntu :)
[21:46	<thompa>	I am going to have to rip my DVD, surely that worse.
[21:46	<Tigerman>	bofh80, i have installed the hotkeys package
[21:46	<tulu>	emmajane: I don't think so, should I try again and tell if you if I do?
[21:46	<Sun_Paladin>	Vlet: so do I just address my questions to a random person whenever I log in here?
[21:46	<Tigerman>	now what?
[21:46	<Reng>	<kahrytan>	what you mean by 2gb limitation? if i use FAT32 as a external im only going to see 2gb out of 1tb?
[21:46	<emmajane>	novanosis: correct, in a terminal window
[21:46	<Tigerman>	i have tried if now the thing would work, but not
[21:46	<SveinT>	Question: can I use gutsy with an older kernel (e.g fom Feisty?)
[21:46	<PurpZeY>	thompa: Best I can suggest is to try to figure out what encoding. . .
[21:46	<Vlet>	Everyone: don't forget that this isn't the only place to seek help. There is also ubuntuforums.org. This place is limited because it depends on the person who knows how to fix your problem being in here at this moment
[21:46	<novanosis>	emmajane: ok i tried it and it just goes blank nothing came up
[21:46	<bofh80>	Tigerman, does it still launch the same thing?
[21:46	<emmajane>	tulu: might be a good idea to try again. I'm not sure what it might be, and I dn't actually have a finger print reader to test myself.
[21:46	<thompa>	PurpZeY: irs maybe DeCSS
[21:46	<Tigerman>	bofh80, yes
[21:46	<thompa>	but that is part of libdvd
[21:46	<tulu>	ok, thanks
[21:47	<emmajane>	novanosis: hmm. It looks like your sources don't include this package...
[21:47	<Tigerman>	bofh80, any other suggestions?
[21:47	<Avariel>	how come when i type "/join ##java" nothing happens ?
[21:47	<chalcedony>	i know i did this before with finding files and saving them to my home directory. i just forgot how.
[21:47	<PurpZeY>	thompa: Sorry mang, Beyond me. . .
[21:47	<Vlet>	Sun_Paladin: I'm pretty good with a lot of things, but I don't know much about grub, so if you ask for 'an expert' and I respond, it's wasting your time and mine
[21:47	<bofh80>	Tigerman, sigh, you've got me installing it now. 1 sec i see how to configure it ok
[21:47	<Tigerman>	ok
[21:47	<joanki>	gnutron: that damned windows, trying to take over my computer, it said "press button to boot from cd" for like .05 seconds
[21:47	<gnutron>	Avariel - drop the extra # Sign maybe
[21:47	<oklopol>	i'm doing /dev/dsp, where can i see/change the frequency of it?
[21:47	<emmajane>	novanosis: I don't see anything usual in my package list that would mean I hve it and you don't.
[21:47	<LiMaO>	kdelibs is broken... kopete won't start and login to msn =/
[21:47	<Avariel>	i tried, it wont even join #java
[21:47	<Sun_Paladin>	Vlet: okay, looking on the forums right now then, thanks for the info
[21:48	<ademan>	the alternate installer keeps failing at "selecting and installing software", do you guys think this means it's trying to access the repositories and that's failing? or what?
[21:48	<niklas-l>	hi how do i get rpcinfo to work i get error
[21:48	<MrPink>	Can anyone reference me to a good Theme Manager App for Ubuntu ?
[21:48	<Avariel>	and they supposedly exist in the list of channels
=== DarkHack is now known as D[a]rkH[a]ck
[21:48	<bofh80>	Tigerman, i hate those spastic keyboard buttons, should be cut off your keyboard heheheh
[21:48	<thompa>	PurpZeY: its ok, gutsy is great, its not an ubuntu problem, its codecs and encryption in obscure dvds
[21:48	<khamael>	how can I reset the "keyrings" used by nm-applet?
[21:48	<emmajane>	novanosis: http://www.frostwire.com/ just download it from their site
[21:48	<Kaitlyn2004>	how do I get the CPU temperature?
[21:48	<Vlet>	Avariel: some channels on freenode require registration. check for messages from the server about the channel you just tried to join.
[21:48	<novanosis>	emmajane: i guess its not the same ol ubuntu, my apt-get does not work, and i dont know how to trial and error this
[21:48	<emmajane>	novanosis: they have a ubuntu package available from the home page.
[21:48	<gnutron>	joanki - try again with spacebar held down to see if it will boot it.
[21:48	<Avariel>	Vlet: oh i see you are right
[21:48	<novanosis>	emmajane: ok i will take a look
[21:48	<joanki>	ok
[21:49	<Avariel>	i want to register but im not sure how
[21:49	<joanki>	windows must know ubuntu is taking over my machine ;)
[21:49	<bluedog>	LiMa0 - temp fix can be found here ->	http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3041
[21:49	<Vlet>	Avariel: it's to prevent spam :)
[21:49	<gnutron>	joanki - i think your ubuntu disk is messed up, not a bootable cd
[21:49	<Avariel>	Vlet: yeah i can imagine, i want to register though but im not sure hwo
[21:49	<bofh80>	Tigerman, bump up a terminal and type hotkeys -l    (that's L ) and see if your keyboard is listed . . . .
[21:49	<joanki>	me, too
[21:49	<src>	Kaitlyn2004, you need lm sensor package installed
[21:50	<joanki>	i'm annoyed that was $.99 wasted ;)
[21:50	<emmajane>	novanosis: sometimes apt is more trouble than it's worth. Especially when there are ubuntu packages available from the main Web site forthe software.
[21:50	<joanki>	but windows wouldn't know that straight off without trying, would it?
[21:50	<Vlet>	Avariel: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup
[21:50	<gnutron>	joanki - it happens :)
[21:50	<SveinT>	trying again (last time), can I use older kernels on gutsy?
[21:50	<neopsyche>	beerfan: ok
[21:50	<SveinT>	and if so, how?
[21:50	<neopsyche>	beerfan: i got gparted going.. how can i format a disk?
[21:51	<gnutron>	SveinT - i really doubt  it. imho
[21:51	<Vlet>	SveinT: I doubt it.
[21:51	<joanki>	ok i'm gonna reburn it now
[21:51	<SveinT>	ok, thanks
[21:51	<SveinT>	no gutsy for me then
[21:51	<gnutron>	joanki - what are you burning with?
[21:51	<Vlet>	SveinT: you'd have to break a lot of package dependencies.... and I bet everything would be broke :)
[21:51	<neopsyche>	how do i format disk in gparted?
[21:51	<rmtlevmatta>	anyone knows is NX server is compatible with 7.10
[21:51	<Tigerman>	bofh80, my keyboard is Genius KB-16e Scroll
[21:51	<SveinT>	Vlet: I see

[21:52	<Tigerman>	and is not in that list when i do hotkeys -l
[21:52	<SveinT>	gutsy won't recognize one of my disks...says it can't set xfermode
[21:52	<comicinker>	neopsyche: a floppydisk?
[21:52	<neopsyche>	comicinker: its a flash disk
[21:52	<SveinT>	and I can't get help anywhere
[21:52	<neopsyche>	comicinker: it shows a little lock in the icon
[21:52	<vlassis>	hi
[21:52	<|neon|>	iplist does not install on ggggutsy because of libnfnetlink1 any suggestions
[21:52	<bofh80>	Tigerman, then i'd say you can safely remove hotkeys it's not going to help :(
[21:52	<chalcedony>	if i'm in Desktop are there directories i can't see with ls ? how can i see them?
[21:52	<SveinT>	tried to submit a bug report, but it hasn't got confirmed yet...and forums are of no help
[21:52	<tulu>	emmajane: the website says "/lib/security is the directory, where PAM assumes its modules on Debian and openSUSE, it may vary for your distro!" is this something I have to worry about?
[21:52	<PurpZeY>	neopsyche: Flashdisk? like, flash-drive?
[21:53	<comicinker>	neopyche: is the write protection off?
[21:53	<rmtlevmatta>	anyone knows is NX server is compatible with 7.10
[21:53	<bofh80>	Tigerman, we will have to find out what in ubuntu is controlling that keyboard launcher
[21:53	<emmajane>	neopsyche: are you running it as root? maybe it's a permisison thing?
[21:53	<MrPink>	Can anyone reference me to a good Theme Manager App for Ubuntu ?
[21:53	<foug>	Why is 6.06 supported longer than 7.10?
[21:53	<Tigerman>	bofh80, okay let's dig in :)
[21:53	<keo92>	How to remove completely a compiled program (OpenLDAP + BerkeleyDB) in order to install slapd ?
[21:53	<vlassis>	what do u suggest about 7.10: upgrade or clean install?
[21:53	<Vlet>	Avariel: yep, irc commands... don't do it in here though, do it in the window that opens for the server, otherwise if you mis-type something, you may broadcast your password to all of #ubuntu
[21:53	<emmajane>	tulu: Ubuntu is basically debian, so probably not.
[21:53	<bofh80>	Tigerman, sure watch this.
[21:53	<TlM>	hello
[21:53	<rmtlevmatta>	6.06 is a LONG time suport edition
[21:53	<Tominator>	hi! I've got some problems with my ralink rt2500 wifi-card. It doesn't connect to the accesspoint. dmesg puts out these parts: http://ubuntuusers.de/paste/16445/ ... this is quite strange because the card used to be ra0 under edgy
[21:53	<Avariel>	hahaha alright i figured that out thanks Vlet
[21:53	<gnutron>	neopsyche - mount it and use mke2fs -j  to format ext3.
[21:53	<TlM>	is gutsy much better than feisty?
[21:53	<joanki>	gnutron:  stupid question, but jkust in case, i can burn ubuntu like usual onto a cd right?
[21:54	<huXfluX>	How to install KDE 4 on Gusty ?!?!
[21:54	<bofh80>	hey people, ANYONE know what is controlling those special/spastic buttons on my funky keyboard?
[21:54	<joanki>	it doesn't have to be done a special way - just drag and drop like i usually do, right?
[21:54	<Vlet>	TlM: it's 8 better
[21:54	<foug>	rmtlevmatta: ahh i see, do you know why? I want to install the server edition but i'm not really sure the differences between 6.06 and 7.10 for server edition.
[21:54	<comicinker>	TlM: of course!
[21:54	<chalcedony>	SveinT: *hugs* keep asking, soon someone will help you with gutsy won't recognize one of your disks...says it can't set xfermode
[21:54	<TlM>	thanks Vlet
[21:54	<MrPink>	Can anyone reference me to a good Theme Manager App for Ubuntu ?
[21:54	<gnutron>	joanki - not exactly, it must be burnt and flagged as 'bootable'
[21:54	<Boonix>	hi can someone explain how to change the settings in xchat to iso?
[21:54	<TlM>	but is it more stable?
[21:54	<Tominator>	bofh80: what du you mean?
[21:54	<joanki>	oh
[21:54	<bofh80>	Tigerman, got your fingers crossed? :P
[21:54	<joanki>	that's the problem then
[21:54	<tulu>	emmajane: well, I tried it again and didn't see any errors but I'm getting the same "USB device not found"

[21:54	<Vlet>	MrPink: yeah, it's built into your control panels ... called 'Appearance'
[21:54	<neopsyche>	gnutron: flashdrive says cannot format to fat32
[21:54	<gnutron>	joanki - youusing nero

[21:54	<joanki>	i will follow step by step what the website says then on ubuntu
[21:55	<quittt>	good night for you all
[21:55	<joanki>	i'll just download their app and do it their way .... thanks
[21:55	<neopsyche>	gnutron: will formating to ext3 change it? To be able to be written to?
[21:55	<rmtlevmatta>	foug: that was a business decision, they whanted to give the corporate guy a secure support scheme
[21:55	<Tominator>	bofh80: are you looking for software which is able to use your special keys?
[21:55	<chalcedony>	night night quittt
[21:55	<MrPink>	Vlet yeah I see that... but when I install a theme it says "Theme successfully installed" but inst listed anywhere and nothing changes

[21:55	<quittt>	it is very weird
[21:55	<foug>	rmtlevmatta: i see, i think i'll just go with 7.10. Was just curious as to why 6.06 was on there and with a longer support time
[21:55	<neopsyche>	gnutron: however I NOTICED after i tried to format it there is a new file on the drive
[21:55	<Vesuro>	Hi all, I'm paranoid about what I'm trying to do, so if anyone could help me out I'd *really* appreciate it - I'm looking for the easiest way to shrink my Linux partition, create an NTFS partition and install XP on the NTFS partition. I want to know how to keep my Linux partition bootable after this since Windows likes to overwrite the MBR. Any ideas?
[21:55	<neopsyche>	gnutron: probably some kind of gparted file
[21:55	<warbisshop>	lol runescape does that game still run
[21:55	<chalcedony>	if i'm in Desktop are there directories i can't see with ls ? how can i see them?

[21:56	<neopsyche>	gnutron: the existing file system is fat32 I can read and copy mp3s etc .. just cant write to the drive

[21:56	<gnutron>	neopsyche - are you using sudo?
[21:56	<pike_>	Vesuro: you wont keep it bootable. xp will overwrite mbr all you can do is recover after

[21:56	<emmajane>	tulu: http://lddubeau.com/avaktavyam/linux-on-a-compal-ifl90/ bad news... doesn't look like it's supported by linux generally.
[21:56	<Vlet>	MrPink: click the customize button on the 'theme' tab... in there, you will see more specific settigns, and likely what you just installed

[21:56	<bofh80>	Tominator, no i hate those things. but we can't be sure until we find out what in ubuntu is launching the applications. something HAS to be controlling it, it's already installed and running, we just need to find it's config

[21:57	<tulu>	emmajane: oh, ok.. well thanks for your help!

[22:00	<gnutron>	neopsyche - no
[22:00	<bofh80>	Tigerman, so in this, you have the button set to launch firefox yes?
[22:01	<snooo>	bluedog: OK. then how did u reinstall? was there just a general package that u could install which pointed to everything else?
[22:01	<pike_>	eregi: its failing to boot from cd id say. possible bad cd?
[22:01	<chalcedony>	lavender_dream: i get the same list with cd Desktop  $ ls as with d ~/Desktop ; ls  .. NEITHER has these downloads in it
[22:01	<Tigerman>	bofh80, yes
[22:01	<Gek_>	anyone efficient in samba?
[22:01	<rat32>	Vlet: got it, i just registered my nickname ! thanks
[22:01	<rat32>	too bad Avariel wasnt available
[22:01	<chalcedony>	lavender_dream: cd ~/Desktop (typo)
[22:01	<neopsyche>	eregi.. i think you came to the wrong place to ask to install windows .. not trying to be mean.. but most people here would probably encourage you to get ubuntu going again
[22:01	<Jupp2>	If I downloaded and burned the Gutsy iso, can avoid updating online?
[22:01	<neopsyche>	gnutron: no?
[22:02	<eregi>	pike_, amm, Iwrote this cd just a few mins beck.. One man suggested to clean MBR..
[22:02	<lavender_dream>	chalcedony: you tried "ls -a" with the -a?
[22:02	<archosguy>	are there any good programs that can video chat with ichat? (I am a newbie)
[22:02	<src>	lavender_dream, do this grep browser.download.lastDir ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/*
[22:02	<soundray>	Jupp2: no, only if you've downloaded the Alternate CD
[22:02	<lavender_dream>	chalcedony: do what src just said
[22:02	<Baldev>	eregi: try formating the drive clean
[22:02	<src>	lavender_dream, and then go to whatever directory is there
[22:02	<gnutron>	neopsyche - no ntfs-config needed unless you're messing with a ntfs volume[s]
[22:02	<Sir_Sid>	How do you play dvd's. I keep getting the error that I do not have sufficient rights even though i installed libdvdcss2
[22:02	<lavender_dream>	src: not my issue, was chalcedony :)
[22:02	<Tigerman>	bofh80, any other suggestions?
[22:02	<src>	sorry
[22:02	<pike_>	eregi: um no. the mbr is on hd it should be looking at cd first so it doesnt matter if jibberish is in mbr
[22:02	<eregi>	neopsyche, I will set the ubuntu, but I need to reinstall the windows for my family..
[22:02	<neopsyche>	gnutron: I diddnt have problem with flashdisk previously.. now its just not letting me write / delete files.
[22:02	<src>	i have bad attention span
[22:02	<gnutron>	neopsyche - apt-get install usbmount
[22:03	<bofh80>	Tigerman, working through it one sec
[22:03	<joshritger>	has anyone been having issues with the fiesty repos since gutsy was released?
[22:03	<pike_>	eregi: thats what you get from windows support :)
[22:03	<soundray>	Sir_Sid: you probably nead libdvdread. See also private message
[22:03	<soundray>	!dvd >	Sir_Sid
[22:03	<lavender_dream>	src: np, it's crazy in here with kazillion text walls all over the place :)
[22:03	<Sir_Sid>	thank you soundray
[22:03	<neopsyche>	gnutron: eregi.. hehe i have the same problem.. family members moaning at me .. I dont like LINUX .. I hate linux! waaaaah.
[22:03	<neopsyche>	;-)
[22:03	<neopsyche>	lol
[22:03	<soundray>	!botsnack
[22:03	<ubotu>	Yum! Err, I mean, APT!
[22:03	<gnutron>	neopsyche - check /etc/fstab for 'ro' and change to 'rw' = read/write.
[22:03	<chalcedony>	ok lavender_dream  src  looking
[22:03	<Jupp2>	soundray, thanx!
[22:03	<pike_>	eregi: an option is vmware you can run full xp within ubuntu
[22:03	<neopsyche>	Lol.. SUDO FAMILY LINUX :-D .. if only it were that easy ! ;-)
[22:03	<gnutron>	neopsyche - be very careful
[22:03	<foug>	Does the server edition of 7.10 come with or without a GUI?
[22:03	<pike_>	rat32: no gui
[22:04	<mzuverink>	What package do I need to install for sound preview of songs on mouse hover?
[22:04	<gnutron>	foug - without gui
[22:04	<neopsyche>	gnutron: be very careful?
[22:04	<outofrange>	Downloads for the upgrade sure are slow.
[22:04	<foug>	gnutron: thanks
[22:04	<neopsyche>	gnutron: regarding?
[22:04	<rat32>	pike_: no gui ?
[22:04	<Baldev>	neopsyche: wish i could sudo entire-workplace linux :)
[22:04	<gnutron>	neopsyche - be very careful editing  fstab
[22:04	<pike_>	foug: server install is basically a stripped desktop install with diff kernel thats it
[22:04	<neopsyche>	gnutron: oh
[22:04	<soundray>	mzuverink: nothing, just configure nautilus (file browser) settings accordingly
[22:04	<joanki>	gnutron: it works now
[22:04	<pike_>	rat32: sorry wront nick
[22:04	<gaurish>	Sir_Sid, http://ubuntuguide.org/
[22:04	<joanki>	thank you
[22:04	<eregi>	neopsyche, mhm, same here, it's like - what's open office, is firefox safe? :DD
[22:04	<rat32>	pike_: didnt know my nick was too popular...
[22:04	<neopsyche>	eregi: doh!
[22:04	<gnutron>	joanki - whee )  cool
[22:04	<Sir_Sid>	thank you
[22:04	<neopsyche>	hehe
[22:04	<foug>	gnutron: i know you can run IRC withou a GUI, but you can you run a file server in IRC? Like OmenServe or something
[22:05	<mzuverink>	Soundray, i did and it does not work
[22:05	<archosguy>	are there any good programs that can video chat with ichat? (I am a newbie)
[22:05	<neopsyche>	eregi: My thoughts are .. just leave it on there and let them moan till they get used to it. :-)
[22:05	<Alien18>	how do i browse a different hdd's directories in terminal please?
[22:05	<neopsyche>	eregi: yes yes and yes.. open office etc.
[22:05	<bofh80>	Tigerman, can you check your settings in Preferences >	Preferred Applications
[22:05	<soundray>	mzuverink: what type of file?
[22:05	<src>	Alien18, cd <mount point of hard disk>
[22:05	<joshritger>	Does anyone know if there is a problem with the fiesty repos, I am having trouble with them?
[22:05	<archosguy>	anyone?
[22:05	<soundray>	!mount >	Alien18 please read ubotu's private message
[22:05	<gnutron>	Alien18 - ls -la /media
[22:05	<Odd-rationale>	How do I know when sbackup is done?
[22:05	<Madpilot>	When I upgraded to Gutsy from Feisty, my Ubuntu logo in the top-left corner was replaced with a little blue Gnome foot - anyone else run into this bug?
[22:06	<neopsyche>	eregi: A copy of Ubuntu is better than an illegal copy of windows :-)
[22:06	<mzuverink>	sundray, all types, I have the full gamut of gstreamer plugins installed, it wont work on oggs, mp3's,  or any other type
[22:06	<orangefly>	does vmware server work with gutsy or not....???....
[22:06	<gnutron>	Alien18 - provided they are  mounted under /media that is.
[22:06	<soundray>	Madpilot: no! How annoying...
[22:06	<neopsyche>	eregi: Not that you are using an illegal copy.. just .. thats my situation :-)
[22:06	<LiMaO>	i wonder when people will learn to correctly spell ubuntu versions' names.. all i see everyone is 'fiesty, gusty'.. can't people spell it correctly at all?
[22:06	<eregi>	neopsyche, I didn't say that I have ilegal copy of windows, but I didn't say I don't have :P
[22:06	<archosguy>	are there any good programs that can video chat with ichat? (I am a newbie)
[22:07	<Madpilot>	soundray, it's minor, but irritating. My splash screen has also been replaced by a Gnome default blue one, but that I know how to fix...
[22:07	<eregi>	neopsyche ok, ok :)
[22:07	<mzuverink>	soundray, it wont work on any types, despite I have all the appropriate gstreamer plugins installed
[22:07	<neopsyche>	LIMAO: lol
[22:07	<gnutron>	archosguy - not that i know of, no.
[22:07	<joanki>	the community ubuntu site says:  Open the Gnome Partition Editor from the System Administration menu.  Does anyone know where i can find the Gnome partition editor from the system admin menu?
[22:07	<Sir_Sid>	I have both libdvdcss2 and libdvdread installed, yet I cannot play it
[22:07	<Tigerman>	bofh80, you are awesome! that's the solution!
[22:07	<pike_>	archosguy: i dont know about ichat but openwengo is kinda cool
[22:07	<joshritger>	!repo
[22:07	<ubotu>	The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[22:07	<neopsyche>	eregi: LIMAO.. perhaps version numbers would be better
[22:07	<bofh80>	Tigerman, i'm just that good :) glad to have helped :)
[22:08	<neopsyche>	LIMAO: version numbers.. but then it wouldnt be so fun!
[22:08	<neopsyche>	;-)
[22:08	<gnutron>	Sir_Sid restart X possibly
[22:08	<archosguy>	thanks guys
[22:08	<eregi>	neopsyche, njees. :D
[22:08	<bofh80>	Tigerman, the thought process was "it says launch 'web browser' but HOW does it know WHAT web browser....tick tick tick 'click' :)
[22:08	<gnutron>	joanki - what are you attempting to do
[22:08	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: one learns math just AFTER he learns grammar. dealing with numbers would be even worse lol
[22:08	<joanki>	parittion my hard drive
[22:08	<neopsyche>	lol .. UBUNTU 7.10 better name?
[22:08	<Sir_Sid>	alright
[22:08	<Sir_Sid>	thanks
[22:08	<fjleon>	hey guys i have 2 hard drives, but i can't mount the second one, i get this error: Mount is denied because NTFS is marked to be in use.
[22:08	<pfein>	My laptop crashed (flaky hardware) while upgrading to Gutsy... any tips on how to recover?
[22:08	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: hehe
[22:08	<joanki>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoPartition?highlight=%28partition%29
[22:09	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: do you know how to correct I/O error on FAT32 USB flash disk?
[22:09	<gnutron>	joanki - let the ubuntu installer do it. just choose guided install [use entire disk]
[22:09	<joshritger>	I am having trouble with the fiesty repos since gutsy was released, can someone help me with them?
[22:09	<joanki>	ok
[22:09	<pike_>	joshritger: its just a load issue likely
[22:09	<soundray>	mzuverink: are they local files?
[22:10	<pike_>	joshritger: you might try changing mirrors in synaptic
[22:10	<mzuverink>	soundray, yes
[22:10	<bofh80>	hey pike_ any ideas if GNUNET is installed by default? can i remove it?
=== Douwd is now known as Douwd`
[22:10	<snooo>	sorri, who was the guy i was just talking too?
[22:10	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: well, i have some experience with that, one of my sony ericsson's cell phone would be incorrectly recognized by ubuntu.. thus not being able to read or write and also reporting wrong disk size
[22:10	<joshritger>	pike_: I have issues where alot of them fail, and it takes like 5-10 min for it to go through the whole list while reloading
[22:11	<soundray>	mzuverink: what size limit have you set in the Preview tab?
[22:11	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: the suggestion is to either format the memory card/usb flash disk using linux
[22:11	<bluedog>	snooo, me??
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: The drive is reporting WHACKED OUT (MESSED UP) DISK SIZE
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: also.. doesnt work in windows
[22:11	<pike_>	bofh80: i wasnt familiar with gnunet. looks cool but i dont know
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: seems to think it cant write files to the USB flash
=== Douwd` is now known as Douwd
[22:11]  * Pelo thinks ubotu has gone insane,  he PMed the bot for upgrade info and it summoned the ops 
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: tried formatting
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: doesnt format
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: says unable
[22:11	<itch_>	Hello guys. Is there any other way to get my compizfusion window decoration back, besides "sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24"
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: even in root
[22:11	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: use fdisk and erase everything.. then create a new partition
[22:11	<LjL>	Pelo: eh? like what?
[22:11	<stmiller>	11,000+ people on ubuntuforums.org. New record!
[22:11	<LjL>	Pelo: (PM please)
[22:11	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: fdisk in dos?
[22:11	<pike_>	joshritger: id try changing country prefix or just do it in synaptic. alot of issues with servers with everyone updating see the topic
[22:12	<bofh80>	pike_, it's causing my problems, i just need to know if the system is using it for anything? i don't know if i installed it myself or not! can i safely remove it? is it installed on your system?
[22:12	<bee_>	11,000 - wow
[22:12	<mzuverink>	soundray, there is no size linit in gnome 2.20 for previe of sound files
[22:12	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: under linux
[22:12	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: oh goody.. how?
[22:12	<Pelo>	LjL,  join me in #pelo and I'll paste it for you
[22:12	<joshritger>	pike_: ok, I wasn't sure
[22:12	<LjL>	Pelo: duh... ok, can't you open a query though :P
[22:12	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: and can i use fat32 for that?
[22:12	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: fdisk /dev/your-device-here
[22:12	<pike_>	bofh80: it was probably a dependacy brought in i dont think the defuault intall uses it thatd be a little odd but possible i guess
[22:12	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: yes. just create a fat32 partition
[22:12	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: oooh.. should be careful about that one.
[22:13	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: ok...
[22:13	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: talk me through it ?
[22:13	<bofh80>	pike_, cool, keeps chewing on my cpu for no reason. :P will get rid now. . . :P thanks
[22:13	<soundray>	mzuverink: any errors in ~/.xsession-errors as you hover over the icon?
[22:13	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: it won't do anything harmful at once, you can be sure of that
[22:13	<Jhs>	stmiller, i wouldn't see that as a good thing.
[22:13	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: heres the output from gparted... Input/output error during write on /dev/sdc
[22:13	<stmiller>	jhs haha !
[22:13	<ademan>	if i installed a "command line system" from the alternate cd, will installing ubuntu-desktop get me the equivalent of having actually installed the "full" desktop?
[22:13	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: it'll ask for changes.. then when exiting fdisk it'll ask to write the changes or not
[22:13	<Jhs>	that means 11,000 people need help because something went wrong with their 7.10 update
[22:13	<Jhs>	(like myself)
[22:13	<john>	is http://us.archive.ubuntu.com down / running like a snail!?
[22:13	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: then use 'sudo fdisk /dev/sdc'
[22:13	<neopsyche>	Jhs: LOL
[22:13	<MTecknology>	Should I choose a 383 or 686 kernel?
[22:14	<neopsyche>	Jhs: thanks for being a beta tester for me :-)
[22:14	<gorski>	i upgraded to gutsy, and when i want to start icon that i made for sudo nautilus, nothing happens. Help?
[22:14	<Jhs>	:P
[22:14	<soundray>	gorski: change it to gksudo nautilus
[22:14	<hasse>	anyone heard of a problem with ace archives if it's more than 40 files ?
[22:14	<PriceChild>	gorski, use gksudo nautilus (but that's probably not the cause)
[22:14	<mrfantastic>	can anyone tell if ndis still works on 7.10?
[22:14	<SkinnyPuppy34>	I don't know what peoples probs are, been running gutsy 6weeks or more no prob
[22:14	<john>	 /msg ubotu mirrors
[22:14	<quittt>	why FluxBox is included in my Session options, even when it is not installed
[22:14	<quittt>	it is very bizarre
[22:14	<Pelo>	gorski,  try the command line from the terminal to test it
[22:15	<gnutron>	MTecknology 386 kernel
[22:15	<PriceChild>	john, no space
[22:15	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: it says :command m for help
[22:15	<neopsyche>	???
[22:15	<gorski>	nothing
[22:15	<undauntedspirit>	SkinnyPuppy34: Dunno, but I'm having all kinds of hard system lockups.
[22:15	<john>	PriceChild, duh :)
[22:15	<mzuverink>	soundray, no
[22:15	<john>	is http://us.archive.ubuntu.com down / running like a snail!?
[22:15	<soundray>	gorski: nothing what?
[22:15	<gorski>	Pelo: from command line is ok
[22:15	<`ph8>	hey all!
[22:15	<PriceChild>	john, /topic
[22:15	<MTecknology>	gnutron: what's the difference?
[22:15	<gorski>	gksudo not working
[22:15	<soundray>	gorski: do you read me?
[22:15	<Stwange>	anyone else having trouble with firefox under gutsy?
[22:15	<john>	oh crap
[22:15	<john>	gutsy is out
[22:15	<quittt>	and if I install it
[22:15	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: press 'm'  check out the commands for 'list partitions', 'delete partition' and 'write changes'
[22:15	<gnutron>	MTecknology - different architecture
[22:15	<john>	where is the changlog?
[22:15	<`ph8>	whenever i try to start compiz (set effects to 'normal' or 'extra') - my screen just goes white, i can do things like turn rain on and draw fire - but the screen is white and no windows are visible - any ideas why that happens?
[22:16	<quittt>	it does included ANOTHER option for Fluxbox
[22:16	<quittt>	it is very strange
[22:16	<bobbo>	anyone else find Gparted on the Gutsy LiveCD incredibly unstable?
[22:16	<MTecknology>	gnutron: I meant, what's the dif between the two
[22:16	<Elfboy>	can some one tell me why i cant put fiels on a usb drive
[22:16	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: says 'selected partition 1'
[22:16	<Elfboy>	said i dont have permision to move files to the usb hd
[22:16	<melange>	I have a really strange problem. I upgraded to gutsy and gnome runs horrible - It's very slow and laggy. However, when I logged in with a dummy-user (I never used) everything was fine, and compiz was running great. What could the problem be? How can I "reset gnome" ? I tried deleting ".gconf*" but it didn't help
[22:16	<DmonGuard>	I have a problem. I would love to install Ubuntu dual boot (and have before) except the GRUB/LILO menu bugs the hell out of everyone else that uses this computer. So I was wondering if it would be possible to do a HD install, but not install a bootloader. And then burn GRUB (or lilo) to a disk. So that windows would start if I didn't have the disk in, but when I put it in and restarted it would give me a menu to select XP or linux.
[22:17	<SkinnyPuppy34>	bobbo: I've used gutsy on alteast 4 installs now and partitioner in the installer worked just fine for me anyway
[22:17	<Pelo>	gorski,  double check the command used in the launcher then
[22:17	<PriceChild>	DmonGuard, on the last step of the desktop installer, you can choose not to install grub.
[22:17	<gnutron>	MTecknology 386 kernel runs on pc's. 686 arch is another type machine
[22:17	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: P = display partitions; D = delete partition; N = new partition
[22:17	<bobbo>	SkinnyPuppy34: it worked for me, just crashed a lot :D
[22:17	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: that's the order you should follow
[22:17	<mrfantastic>	anyone had trouble with there wifi cards?
[22:17	<Elfboy>	gutsy out?
[22:17	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.
[22:17	<neopsyche>	The kernel still uses the old table.
[22:17	<neopsyche>	The new table will be used at the next reboot.
[22:17	<DmonGuard>	I know, but how would I go about burning it to a disk so that it gives me a linux or windows menu if and only if i insert the CD
[22:18	<PriceChild>	Elfboy, /topic
[22:18	<gorski>	Pelo: it sais: gksudo "nautilus --browser %U"
[22:18	<cosmin>	i whant to intstall apache on linux......what is the simple way?
[22:18	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: try umounting it first.. 'sudo umount /dev/sdc'
[22:18	<Elfboy>	lol
[22:18	<mrfantastic>	its always the wifi that gives me trouble every time i upgrade ubuntu
[22:18	<freenet>	hallo
[22:18	<LiMaO>	cosmin: sudo apt-get install apache2
[22:18	<Pelo>	DmonGuard,  you can set  grub to start windows by default and you can also hide the menu , so that when you want to boot ubuntu you just hit esc after the bios stuff , get the menu and then you can select  ubuntu
[22:18	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: sudo: unmount: command not found
[22:18	<neopsyche>	oh...
[22:18	<neopsyche>	dots
[22:18	<LiMaO>	neopsyche: not UNmount.. but UMOUNT
[22:18	<neopsyche>	lol
[22:18	<LiMaO>	hehe
[22:18	<gorski>	Pelo: i removed  --browser %U and it works
[22:19	<quittt>	why Ubuntu is in English?
[22:19	<Elfboy>	PriceChild, can u help me with some thing
[22:19	<quittt>	it should be in Latim
[22:19	<DmonGuard>	Pelo: I know I can start windows by default, but how do I hide the menu like that
[22:19	<neopsyche>	LiMaO: says not mounted
[22:19	<quittt>	nobody would complain
[22:19	<Pelo>	gorski, congrats
[22:19	<bieb>	why latin?
[22:19	<bobbo>	quittt: It is based in England/Isle of Man?
[22:19	<LiMaO>	quittt: you can choose whatever language you want. even esperanto
[22:19	<Jhs>	so, i upgraded to 7.10, now it won't boot in 2.6.14-22, only in 2.6.16-20. any suggestions?
[22:19	<PriceChild>	!offtopic | quittt bieb bobbo
[22:19	<ubotu>	quittt bieb bobbo: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[22:19	<PriceChild>	Elfboy, ask your question to the channel and hopefully somone will respond.
[22:19	<Ominous_>	is there a guide for xgl and gusty anywhere?

[22:37	<yaser>	PriceChild, yea, someone else posted it somewhere but no answer what i mean is, is it right to consider this an Ubuntu error, or i should report it in Gnome.org somewhere, or its more a Matlab stuff(have in mind it worked right in 7.04)
[22:37	<cimon>	nickrud: I was going to, not much to backup, some pinup piccys and my moria characters and scores...

[23:12	<Jordan_U>	joanki, http://www.fs-driver.org/
[23:12	<don-o>	lomez: ntfs
[23:12	<KeithWeisshar>	if done during the live cd session the drivers is gone
[23:12	<lomez>	don-o, alright, thanks
[23:12	<joanki>	i hope i don't royally screw up
[23:12	<don-o>	lomez: im just not sure if the read/write driver is trusted or not. apparently it is.
[23:13	<Jordan_U>	KeithWeisshar, You can just restart X
[23:13	<src>	joanki, hope you have backups
[23:13	<src>	:D
[23:13	<matthew_>	jordan_U; ok, /dev/sda1
[23:13	<joanki>	i do
[23:13	<Jordan_U>	KeithWeisshar, They say to reboot because it's "easier"
[23:13	<flake>	i have a hp amd64x2 5000+ media center XP (xp is 32bit software), trying to boot with 7.10 64-bit, going to black screen
[23:13	<joanki>	but now i just had a system crash when reinstalling xp
[23:13	<joanki>	argh
[23:13	<giannis>	can I get some help please ?
[23:13	<src>	joanki, happens
[23:13	<justin__>	desktop effects help anyone?
[23:13	<KeithWeisshar>	does installing nvidia drivers require a reboot
[23:13	<joanki>	src: when i am reinstalling xp, should i partition then? or should i let the ubuntu cd do it for me?
[23:14	<giannis>	problem with sound .
[23:14	<Kyoukipichi>	KeithWeisshar: yes
[23:14	<Jordan_U>	matthew_, Ok, then run "sudo mkdir /media/ntfs-files && sudo mount -t -ro ntfs /dev/sda1 /media/ntfs-files"
[23:14	<seamus7>	justin__: what's your question?
[23:14	<zagibu>	joanki: always install windows before you install linux
[23:14	<src>	since you're at it you might as well partition during the windows install and tell linux to use the free space
[23:14	<Blama>	Hey everybody, is there a reason why none of my settings in Ubuntu get saved? Nothing I do saves and I have to redo them when I reboot. I have an ATI x800 GT. This means I have to use the vesa driver by doing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and changing the driver. But when I reboot it goes back to ATI.
[23:14	<MrUnagi>	ntfs
[23:14	<MrUnagi>	ntfs supports fast searching and indexing
[23:14	<zagibu>	cause windows just overwrites the bootloader
[23:14	<scriptfu>	blama u on a livecd?
[23:14	<joanki>	zagibu: should i install xp in the full partition and then have the ubuntu cd partition it again for me?
[23:15	<Blama>	scriptfu, No
[23:15	<numus>	what does nvidia-glx-new mean
[23:15	<Mmph>	I keep getting an I/O error on hd0 when trying to use the live CD... I dont have an hd0! It also attempts to write grub to hd0. anyone know how  I can avoid this?
[23:15	<Hilikus>	do i need a system account for every linux share i want to access from windows using samba?
[23:15	<numus>	err the software package for nvidia-glx-new is not enabled
[23:15	<zagibu>	yeah, just let ubuntu autopartition it's half of the drive
[23:15	<ekp>	Jordan_U: scanner is not detected in Ubuntu........7.10  Epson RX620
[23:15	<punzada>	joanki, xp first, have the cd setup just the windows partition and leave the rest of the drive totally blank, then when installing ubuntu afterwards break the partition apart as needed
[23:15	<lavender_dream>	!restricted
[23:15	<generalsnus>	I gotta say..im pretty impressed with Gutsy :D   only 1 case i need to resolve: HDA Intel "onboard sound" does not work..i can chosse it in sound manager etc. but i get no sound. is there anyone out there who can help me troubleshoot this problem?

[23:15	<Jordan_U>	ekp, You tried xsane ?
[23:15	<joanki>	so punzada, you are saying let xp ihave it ALL at first
[23:15	<punzada>	no
[23:15	<joanki>	and then let ubuntu cd split it
[23:16	<ekp>	Jordan_U: yes
[23:16	<punzada>	let xp have a part of it
[23:16	<joanki>	ok
[23:16	<K3nt>	"nvidia-glx-new"  is not enabled. huh? im trying to enable my video card...
[23:16	<joanki>	but the it says that the way i did, it d: gets the rest

[23:16	<joanki>	is that correct
[23:16	<bobbo>	orb2: System ->	Admin ->	Graphics and Screens
[23:16	<numus>	adamk you still there?
[23:16	<punzada>	sounds right
[23:16	<ekp>	Jordan_U: printer is detected OK
[23:16	<orb2>	Okay I tried that and only one screen shows up
[23:16	<joanki>	ok

[23:17	<seamus7>	joanki: you ought to use a partition program and set up the partition for windows at the size you want ... the rest will be empty unpartitioned space awaiting your ubunut install ... when you install ubuntu you will use its partition guide to install into the empty space
[23:17	<lomez>	Jordan_U yes, between two drives actually, im reformatting one of them
[23:17	<Mr_Giraffe>	!proftpd
[23:17	<don-o>	Mr_Giraffe: google will probably work just as well since you know what you're looking for
[23:18	<Dumptruck>	I am trying to put a dependency in the usr/lib folder
[23:18	<Mr_Giraffe>	don-o, i don't, that's the thing :P
[23:18	<Fiona>	Hey - Can someone help me with my totally hosed new Gutsy install. I'm relatively new to Linux and Ubuntu, but not so new that I know my problem isn't normal.
[23:18	<Dumptruck>	I just can't figure out how
[23:18	<riotkittie>	Fiona: can you elaborate on 'totally hosed'
[23:18	<joanki>	seamus7: so it's good i made c: drive for windows 37 and left d: at 37 for data
[23:18	<ekp>	Jordan_U:  tried editing /etc/udev/ rules but no luck
[23:18	<joanki>	correct?
[23:18	<IpMoo>	oops
[23:18	<OiPenguin>	I'm desperate for a laptop where I can install Ubuntu and it will work right off for less than $1500. Has anyone got an advice?
[23:18	<terrestre>	how i go to tty? ctrl+alt+F1 didn't work
[23:18	<Dumptruck>	says I don't have permission
[23:18	<Mr_Giraffe>	does anybody know how to set up an ftp server using proftpd?
[23:18	<IpMoo>	Fiona:    what went wrong
[23:18	<Mr_Giraffe>	i thought i had it working, but apparently pam is borked and hating me
[23:18	<K3nt>	<---- dropped vista for ubuntu!!
[23:18	<don-o>	times9: f6
[23:18	<msikma>	Hi everybody, I'm using Gutsy on a MacBook. Any way I can link CTRL+Click to right-click?
[23:18	<Jordan_U>	ekp, Is it supposedly supported by sane?
[23:18	<Mr_Giraffe>	and i need to know how to get pam to <3 proftpd
[23:18	<Mr_Giraffe>	!pam
[23:18	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about pam - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[23:18	<src>	Dumptruck, sudo cp;
[23:19	<riotkittie>	OiPenguin: Dell sells laptops with ubuntu preinstalled. i'm not sure of the specs, but .... they should be in that price range. also, system 76.
[23:19	<bobbo>	Mr_Giraffe: sudo apt-get install proftpd gproftpd, set it up using gproftpd in System menu
[23:19	<Jordan_U>	msikma, Yes, but I just do a three finger tap
[23:19	<lomez>	OiPenguin, have you looked at Ubuntu on Dell's?
[23:19	<src>	Dumptruck, or if you have lots of stuff to do as root, do a sudo bash or sudo su -
[23:19	<Dumptruck>	what is cp?
[23:19	<Mr_Giraffe>	bobbo, i hate guis, but whatever
[23:19	<Fiona>	Basically, I had issues with my monitor, but Gutsy managed to fix them, but then I found that the gamma settings were screwed, and xgamma didn't seem to do it right. So I installed the restricted driver for my ATi card. Then when I restarted, the keyboard setting reverted to QWERTY on login (I use Dvorak) and it wouldn't accept my usrename or password.
[23:19	<lomez>	OiPenguin they are pretty decent prices, a bit cheaper than Windows, and theyre not bad
[23:19	<Mr_Giraffe>	Dumptruck, cp = copy
[23:19	<ekp>	Jordan_U: I have had no problem with other distros including Debian based
[23:19	<Dumptruck>	ah ha
[23:19	<msikma>	Jordan_U: I'd personally prefer CTRL+Click since that's how I used to do that in Mac OS X
[23:19	<Fiona>	I went to the recovery terminal and the user still exists
[23:19	<Blama>	Hey everybody, is there a reason why none of my settings in Ubuntu get saved? Nothing I do saves and I have to redo them when I reboot. I have an ATI x800 GT. This means I have to use the vesa driver by doing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and changing the driver. But when I reboot it goes back to ATI. I am not on the LiveCD
[23:19	<bobbo>	Mr_Giraffe: jsut leave out gproftpd then
[23:19	<caner>	i have geforce go 7200 . should i use nvidia-glx-new or nvidia-glx-legacy ?
[23:19	<orb2>	Does anyone know how to configure Dual Screens when only one shows up in "Screens and Graphics" ?????
[23:19	<src>	Dumptruck, the thing you use to copy stuff from <A>	to <B>	(cp <A>	<B>)
[23:19	<Mr_Giraffe>	bobbo, i already have proftpd installed
[23:19	<numus>	anyone know what software for nvidia-glx-new not enabled
[23:20	<Dumptruck>	the command line copy kinda freaks me out
[23:20	<matthew_>	jordan_U; i don't think that worked, it just spitted out some sort of usage manual
[23:20	<bobbo>	Mr_Giraffe: what part are you needing help with?
[23:20	<Mr_Giraffe>	i just don't know how do get it to work with pam
[23:20	<src>	Dumptruck, get used to it.
[23:20	<IpMoo>	Fiona:    thats sounds wierd.. was a clean install  of 7.10
[23:20	<seamus7>	joanki: i don't think you understand ... windows will be in the ntfs files system while ubuntu will use the ext3 file system .... your hard drive will be partitioned (divided) into one area just for your windows operating system and all the files you have for it ... and the other partition/s will be just for your ubuntu operating system and all the files you use within it ...
[23:20	<Jordan_U>	msikma, The problem is that ctrl click already means something in a lot of applications, usually to open something in a new tab ( like in Firefox )
[23:20	<OiPenguin>	riotkittie: lomez: I'm in Norway. They don't sell version which comes with preinstalled Ubuntu in the us. May I assume that similar models will work?
[23:20	<Fiona>	IpMoo: yep it was
[23:20	<ekp>	Jordan_U: modprobe ls?
[23:20	<yellow_chicken>	anyone have this problem? when i install ubuntu it hangs at 82%, "scanning the mirror"
[23:20	<Dumptruck>	lol
[23:20	<IpMoo>	Fiona:     what were u running befor  7.04 >?
[23:20	<Dumptruck>	<--- dropped ubuntu for empanadas
[23:20	<Jordan_U>	ekp, ?
[23:20	<msikma>	Jordan_U: hmm...I also have a fancy function key to the left of my CTRL.
[23:20	<orb2>	yellow_chicken I had that problem and I left it for 15 minutes and it finished
[23:20	<msikma>	I guess that could be used
[23:21	<Jimdb>	joanki:  there are windows ext2/3 file system drivers and there are ntfs file system drivers for linux
[23:21	<Fiona>	IpMoo: Yes, but I did a clean install anyway. I burned tho iso again, formatted the partition and reinstalled afresh
[23:21	<ekp>	would that command list perifrials?
[23:21	<orb2>	Does anyone know how to configure Dual Screens when only one shows up in "Screens and Graphics" ?????
[23:21	<LjL>	Blama: what does « mount | grep "on / " » say?
[23:21	<Q_Continuum>	OiPenguin, if you visit the US site for linux-equipped machines, and configure a windows-equipped one identically, then yes the hardware should all work out of the box with a 'Dell remastered CD'
[23:21	<yellow_chicken>	orb2: for real? i am still waiting ....
[23:21	<Mr_Giraffe>	bobbo, pam is on here and isn't playing nice with proftpd
[23:21	<Dumptruck>	in B do I need to use the file name?
[23:21	<joanki>	seamus7: ok, but i started correctly? i am reinstalling my xp op system (to clean up my old op system, which had a memory leak) and partitioned it to have 47 m each
[23:21	<msikma>	I love 7.10. Excellent software.
[23:21	<joanki>	is that correct?
[23:21	<flake>	does it take a long time for 7.10 amd64 bit to boot up, it stays on a black screen for a while, got impatient and turned it off
[23:21	<Dumptruck>	in your example?
[23:21	<Jordan_U>	msikma, That is the command key ( in mac terms ) / the super key ( in linux terms )
[23:21	<K3nt>	msikma: I KNOW!
[23:21	<joanki>	i would hate to do all the installations and find out i did it wrong
[23:21	<heartsblood>	does the fah-install script still work in gutsy?
[23:21	<joanki>	at this point i can turn around and fix it
[23:21	<Dankchild>	hey can someone help me install wine onto feisty fawn?
[23:21	<joanki>	pls
[23:21	<noor>	NOOO!! my windowborder where has it gone?! T___T i got compiz but no window border

[23:21	<LjL>	!wine >	Dankchild    (Dankchild, see the private message from Ubotu)
[23:21	<Slart>	flake: does it work after waiting a while? or it just never starts?
[23:21	<Mr_Giraffe>	Dankchild, it's fairly simple, just sudo apt-get install wine iirc
[23:21	<lavender_dream>	msikma: Love it when you still can... there are times we fall in love with it over and over... then there are times we have a love/hate relationship, but nothing too violent of nature :)
[23:21	<src>	Dumptruck, not necessarily. for example cp /home/user/myfile.yxy /usr/local/bin will copy myfile.yxy to /usr/local/bin
[23:22	<heartsblood>	fah = folding@home.
[23:22	<joanki>	please could somoene just tel me if i did it correctly
[23:22	<flake>	i select start or install and it does a couple of small things and then goes 'black'
[23:22	<LjL>	Blama:  i meant, type that in the terminal and give me the output
[23:22	<seamus7>	joanki: if you're starting from scratch then the first thing to do is create a partition of in your case 37GB into which you will install windows ... the rest of the hard drive is empty unpartitioned space until you install Ubuntu at which point you use its partitioning guide to use the unused space in which to install

[23:23	<joanki>	i do want NTFS, right?
[23:23	<msikma>	One thing that surprised me was that since I didn't have internet access during installation, it commented out *all* repositories because it couldn't ping them!
[23:24	<Mr_Giraffe>	src, it's trying to go through pam but for some reason isn't working...
[23:24	<nickrud>	n8: deb is a definition used in /etc/apt/sources.list, see that for an example

[23:26	<seamus7>	joanki: windows is by default in the ntfs format while ubuntu by default is in a format called ext3
[23:26	<elite>	thx for helping Jordan_U
[23:26	<Viper550>	Okay, this may sound very stupid, but is Gutsy any good?
[23:26	<Fiona>	Can someone help me: I had issues with my monitor, but Gutsy managed to fix them, but then I found that the gamma settings were screwed, and xgamma didn't seem to do it right. So I installed the restricted driver for my ATi card. Then when I restarted, the keyboard setting reverted to QWERTY on login (I use Dvorak) and it wouldn't accept my usrename or password. I went to the recovery terminal and the user still exists.
[23:26	<PriceChild>	Viper550, make up your own mind.
[23:26	<src>	Dumptruck, well how's your grub menu look like?
[23:26	<LjL>	Viper550: it sounds a bit stupid, yes.
[23:26	<Jordan_U>	elite, np
[23:26	<dredhammer>	hi folks what library do you need to make kde based programs look good in ubuntu? the skins for the programs i am using in gutsy do not look good
[23:26	<elite>	;)
[23:26	<ekp>	Jordan_U: any suggestions?
[23:26	<Shapeshifter>	Rob125: It accepts the chooser I chose but not the backround color. I'm not using a login window anyway and have automatic login enabled but the backround color still matters. it worked before upgrading to gutsy.
[23:27	<n8>	i run deb in term and i get  " bash: deb: command not found "
[23:27	<riotkittie>	Viper550: it depends on what you consider good. i doubt anyone here would label it awful by any means.
[23:27	<Dumptruck>	I am also able to access the windows files from linux
[23:27	<src>	Dumptruck, its in /boot/grub/menu.lst i think
[23:27	<ivan>	le canne!!!!!!!!!!!
[23:27	<Mmph>	can we install ubuntu without it downloading any packages?

[23:27	<Rob125>	Shapeshifter: you've got it set to 'themed' on the top menu?
[23:27	<ekp>	Jordan_U: can you hand off to someone in channel that can?
[23:27	<`ph8>	i'm having a couple of issues with the taskbar disappearing when switching desktops
[23:27	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	does gusty even use an xorg.conf anymore, because i TOATLY deleted mine, restarted, and nothing happened, now its working fine with no xorg.conf
[23:27	<mordok>	?
[23:28	<Fiona>	why would you do that
[23:28	<Shapeshifter>	Rob125: "Themed with face browser"
[23:28	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	because i wanted a fresh one
[23:28	<heartsblood>	Has anybody used the ubuntu F@H install script on gutsy?  when I try to install it as a server and run /etc/init.d/foldingathome start I get '/etc/init.d/foldingathome: 23: [[: not found; /etc/init.d/foldingathome: 33: [[: not found.  Any ideas?
[23:28	<Jordan_U>	ekp, No, you might try grabbing the sane *source* package from debian since that worked and compile it on Ubuntu
[23:28	<Squid_>	does anyone have ever used a mix CD audio and data on ubuntu I can not see the tracks sound juicer dos not play it either see the tracks
[23:28	<ekp>	Ok
[23:29	<riotkittie>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: bulletproofx.
[23:29	<LjL>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: i guess that's because of the "bulletproof X" feature that was implemented in gutsy.
[23:29	<swedestralian>	i'm looking for some help on getting my headphone port working
[23:29	<Jordan_U>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza, If there is no Xorg.conf it just figures things out at start, it's been able to do that for a while
[23:29	<ekp>	Jordan_U: does 7.10 have the tools or do I need to download them
[23:29	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	well how can i coustomise my xorg.conf then?
[23:29	<riotkittie>	bulletproofx makes me want to shoot myself
[23:29	<riotkittie>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: the same way you customized the last one.
[23:29	<froyd>	im looking for somebody to help me with wpa2, anybody ? pls, help is much appreciated
[23:29	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Actually it sounds like it's just X not needing explicit configuration for his hardware :)

[23:30	<swedestralian>	is there anybody here willing to help me get my headphone jack working?
[23:30	<Jordan_U>	ekp, You will need to install the package "build-essential" and use apt-get build-dep, do you already know how to recompile a debian source package?
[23:30	<chook__>	ooh sorry i'm in di english room
[23:30	<K3nt>	how do i enable stuff like the cube effect etc..
[23:30	<riotkittie>	Jordan_U: ah. i thought X always required a config  <learns something every day>

[23:31	<Jimdb>	Congratulations folks.  This 7.10 is an exceptional product.  I hope everyone will take the time to spread the word.  Tell one new person a day about ubuntu.  In no time you'll be surprised at what you have accomplished.  Again, congratulations on such a fantastic product.
[23:31	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, It used to, but it becomes less and less dependent on it every release :)
[23:31	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Soon it will only be required if you want to override a default :)
[23:32	<ekp>	Jordan_U: frontends or backends for Sane?
[23:32	<orb2>	Can anyone help me set up dual montiors please?  Only one will show up in the Screens and Graphics menu :(
[23:32	<codecaine>	anybody know why ubuntu gutsy connection is slow on the internet is there anything I can configure?
[23:32	<Rob125>	Jordan_U: I dunno if I'd call it less dependent. Perhaps more fool-proof.
[23:32	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	whenever i try to start desktop effects, i get a toatly un-descriptive "could not start desktop effects"

[23:32	<Jordan_U>	ekp, Backends
[23:32	<src>	Dumptruck, no

[23:32	<riotkittie>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: ok. let's talk. are you ongutsy?
[23:32	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	radeon X700
[23:32	<riotkittie>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: are you using an ati?
[23:32	<Jordan_U>	Rob125, If it doesn't even need the file to exist, isn't that less dependent on it ? :)
[23:32	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	im on gusty
[23:32	<riotkittie>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: k. you're blacklisted. we can over ride that, if you'd like.
[23:32	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	using flgrx driver
[23:33	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	blacklisted?
[23:33	<js_>	is there an issue with compiz and the window manager? i enabled the easy effects and my window manager dissappeared
[23:33	<riotkittie>	oh. flgrx i cannot help with.
[23:33	<Rob125>	Jordan_U: Well, it does need the file to exist. X flips out if it doesn't have it -- now it'll just write one if it can't find it.
[23:33	<Cable86>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: desktop effects won't work with the fglrx driver
[23:33	<Dumptruck>	src: oh I sent the menu.ls file
[23:33	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	danget
[23:33	<lavender_dream>	Easy question :) What is the best way to install software in Ubuntu so that it picks up whenever there are updates to both supported and nonsupported applications? is it by the synaptic manager or apt-get or aptitude?
[23:33	<Dumptruck>	and it is to big to paste here
[23:33	<Jordan_U>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza, Install XGL ( sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl ) if you want compiz with fglrx
[23:33	<src>	Dumptruck, put it in the paste bin.. see channel topic
[23:33	<Rob125>	lavender_dream: all three will work perfectly :)
[23:33	<K3nt>	riotkittie: ok, now what
[23:33	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	thanks
[23:33	<Cable86>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: ATI should be releasing a new version of fglrx that does work with it in the next month or two though
[23:33	<Navid>	Hi, I have an issue I couldnt resolve myself. I installed ubuntu on my xp and it was fine, i had to format xp and after installing xp again the grub boot menu was gone it would directly go to xp
[23:33	<src>	and send us the link
[23:33	<lavender_dream>	Rob125: You lie!
[23:34	<riotkittie>	K3nt: wait. what are you what'ing me about?
[23:34	<Navid>	I tried all of the https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows and it didnt work
[23:34	<Navid>	How can i recover ubuntu?
[23:34	<joanki>	i know this isn't the right room to ask this, but maybe someone will be nice and answer - i have a dell driver cd for vista, but i changed my op sys to xp... the cd doesn't say vista, can i use it to install the drivers in my xp operatins system?
[23:34	<Flannel>	lavender_dream: They all deal with the same database, so they all work interchangably
[23:34	<riotkittie>	lavender_dream: synaptic is merely a graphical front end for apt.
[23:34	<Rob125>	lavender_dream: I do? I've not had any problem with them all working. Are you sure?

[23:34	<riotkittie>	well not exactly. but eh. fever. laziness. woo.

[23:36	<lithium>	anyone know if there is a sure-fire way to check if a graphics card is dead, or just needs a bios flashed?
[23:36	<Jordan_U>	unstable, You need to use the alternate CD for that
[23:36	<kitche>	lavender_dream: I believe ubuntu disabled that feature since ubuntu uses a patched version of firefox their own version really
[23:36	<Cable86>	Rob125: firefox 2.0.0.7 fixed a bug with quicktime, which Linux does not have...thus, updating it to 2.0.0.7 in linux would be pointless
[23:36	<swedestralian>	i can not get my headphone jack to work,   can anybody help me?
[23:36	<Flannel>	lavender_dream: Its because 2.0.0.6 is in the repositories.  Thats the version in ubuntu.  It'll get updated in a few days, if it hasnt been already.

[23:41	<Cable86>	mikebot: i believe it depends on what packages you have installed....obviously they can't fit every single package available onto a single cd, so depending on what you have installed it may have to download some additional packages

[23:42	<cesar_>	help, login package failed
[23:42	<Flannel>	Jordan_U: gksu is symlinked to gksudo, so there's no difference there.  (I'd check the man page myself, but I dont have gksu installed, so...)
[23:42	<mikebot>	OK, well, thanks for the help
[23:42	<speaker219>	Can anyone here tell me if Gusty is worth trying?
[23:42	<garu>	mikebot lol
[23:43	<mikebot>	I've going to try it, so hopefully brb.

[23:43	<blahblahx>	how can i remaster ubuntu gutsy?
[23:43	<Cable86>	speaker219: Gutsy is awesome
[23:43	<orb2>	Does anyone know how to enable the cube/other compiz effects in Gutsy?
[23:43	<Flannel>	blahblahx: define remaster
[23:43	<src>	Dumptruck, look at the pastebin, try that
[23:43	<cesar_>	help, login package failed!
[23:43	<speaker219>	is it possible to install gusty from a USB drive?
[23:43	<garu>	speaker219 look at the number of people here, and think about how this channel was like 4 days ago :o
[23:43	<blahblahx>	ok so i installed ubuntu and customized it to my needs
[23:43	<Jordan_U>	Flannel, Oh, on other distributions they use different back ends ( probably just done by passing different switches to gksu )
[23:43	<blahblahx>	how do i make it into a bootable, instalable livecd?
[23:43	<cesar_>	now "base-files" is failing
[23:43	<Rob125>	Speaker219: sure is! Christer Edwards just did a tutorial on that a week ago.
[23:43	<cesar_>	helppppp
[23:43	<Flannel>	blahblahx: Just remove/add whatever packages you want
[23:43	<blahblahx>	then...

[23:44	<cesar_>	could not install bash???? what the hell?
[23:44	<cesar_>	i'm screwed
[23:44	<blahblahx>	how do i make it a bootable/installable livecd?
[23:44	<garu>	speaker219 Gutsy should be comulsory to install by law!lol
[23:44	<cesar_>	thanks a lot, ubuntu
[23:44	<Flannel>	blahblahx: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
[23:44	<livingdaylight>	Can i install Gutsy Gibbon if my pc doens't support 3D? I hear it comes with Compiz by default and my pc doesn't support it
[23:44	<K3nt>	what settings enable the cube effect?
[23:44	<Jordan_U>	cesar_, Where are you getting that error ?
[23:44	<tck0>	why isnt my root password working for accessing the restricted drivers area ?
[23:44	<cesar_>	in the upgrade manager jordan_U
[23:44	<tck0>	i changed the pass with sudo passwd . but it doesnt accept it
[23:44	<seamus7_>	froyd: sorry I had to go ... did someone help you with wpa2?
[23:44	<Dumptruck>	sorry I am new to the pastebin thing - how do I check your response?
[23:44	<blahblahx>	is there an easier way to do this?
[23:44	<cesar_>	now it says "could not install passwd" !!!!
[23:44	<Jordan_U>	livingdaylight, Yes, it degrades gracefully
[23:44	<speaker219>	can i have a link to that gusty USB drive install tutorial?
[23:44	<src>	Dumptruck, same url
[23:44	<Stormx2>	livingdaylight: Yeah, it'll work fine. Compiz just won't be enabled.
[23:44	<Flannel>	tck0: sudo always asks for your uesr password (unless you've set it to ask for a root password)
[23:44	<cesar_>	a lot of things are failing
=== jake_ is now known as orb2
[23:45	<tck0>	i know
[23:45	<ctothej>	for the terminal, where can I find what each color means (for file, folders, links, etc)?
[23:45	<Flannel>	tck0: but, you don't need a root password at all.  Why'd you set one?
[23:45	<livingdaylight>	Jordan_U, so pop in live cd and it'll realize my pc is not up to it and adapt? cool
[23:45	<databuddy>	Flannel i found a good livecd tut
[23:45	<Dumptruck>	add the 3 pluses?
[23:45	<cesar_>	is the upgrade manager working? should i just do a clean install?
[23:45	<livingdaylight>	Stormx2, sanx
[23:45	<orb2>	How do I enable Compiz in gutsy?
[23:45	<tck0>	well whats the default password then ?
[23:45	<Jordan_U>	tck0, On Ubuntu gksu uses sudo by default
[23:45	<databuddy>	lemme find it real fast ;)
[23:45	<warbler>	Ryuho: I vnc into server running xfce - whats up?

[23:45	<Flannel>	tck0: There is no default root password.  The root account is locked
[23:45	<Jordan_U>	tck0, You can change that with gksu-settings
[23:45	<Stormx2>	!sudo | tck0
[23:45	<ubotu>	tck0: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
[23:45	<Dumptruck>	and how do I open gedit as root?
[23:45	<corpsicle>	ok, i want to kill ubunutu right now
[23:45	<Ryuho>	warbler did you have to do anything special to set it up?
[23:45	<Stormx2>	!sudo | Dumptruck

[23:46	<numus>	frank_ i can't force it to use the nvidia drivers.. it keeps using the vesa drivers
[23:46	<cesar_>	gutsy is the worst upgrade ever, when i upgraded to feisty i didnt get a single error
[23:46	<speaker219>	is it true that gusty comes w/ compiz fusion
[23:46	<LeChacal>	hey i was reading an old forums post and this guy talked of something called " xkillThat" that you could run and it would give you the ability to kill process just by clicking on the program. I tried it and it said couldn't find like it isnt really. Anyone heard of this or know what he is talking about?
[23:46	<cesar_>	now EVERYTHING is breaking
[23:46	<Stormx2>	garu: I'd say k3b is the best. You might need to turn dma on...
[23:46	<element>	im not getting erryors with guts
[23:46	<Stormx2>	speaker219: Yes.
[23:46	<orb2>	seamus7_: okay the only options though are none normal and extra... no specific options like the cube, etc
[23:46	<element>	im not gettting errors
[23:47	<corpsicle>	it installs and asks me if i want to use the ati driver, and so i do, and then it runs 1900x1200 ( my monitor does 1680x1050 ) and then i change the monitor settings, choose my monitor, say that its widescreen, set the correct resolution and reboot, then it tells me it cant be configured and starts in like 800x600
[23:47	<tommy__>	ok
[23:47	<element>	nothing wrong for me
[23:47	<Flannel>	blahblahx: Sure it will, you just have to customize the liveCD independantly.  I don't believe theres a method in place currently to casper up a current system
[23:47	<Jordan_U>	t|om, Please file a bug report
[23:47	<frank_>	numus: did you try the restricted drivers manager?
[23:47	<seamus7_>	orb2: you have to inistall compizconfig-settings-manager in synaptic in order to get the cube options
[23:47	<cesar_>	well i dont have login, adduser, or passwd anymore, so i'm not sure how i'm going to use my computer
[23:47	<Rob125>	Speaker219: http://edoceo.com/liber/ubuntu-live-usb
[23:47	<Laris>	Hi

[23:47	<numus>	frank_ ya it is enabled but it is not being used
[23:47	<Laris>	?
[23:47	<orb2>	seamus7_: okay how do I do that
[23:47	<Rob125>	speaker219: I lied. It wasn't Christer Edwards.

[23:48	<numus>	frank_ i selected the nvidia drviers and it keeps going to vesa everytime i restart
[23:48	<Dumptruck>	so copy and paste the pastebin into my menu.lst file?  what changes were made?
[23:48	<dr_spork>	Does anyone know where keyboard shortcuts are stored in Gutsy? I just upgraded and now the keyboard shortcuts app doesn't actually affect the shortcuts at all.
[23:48	<cesar_>	let's just get one thing clear guys
[23:48	<cesar_>	the name of it is GUTSY, not GUSTY
[23:48	<pwnt->	I try to do a backup for my home/user and it doesn't work, using rsync. check this http://pastebin.com/m4a3f4867 - anyhelp would be appreciate, I try to backup them in my external HDD.
[23:48	<databuddy>	so get your system configged etc properly and then do that and yer damn golden
[23:48	<justin__>	Anyone suggest a good bittorrent client? The Ubuntu default one is horribly unconfigurable.
[23:48	<scguy318>	cesar_: the next one should be called Horny Hedghog :P
[23:48	<src>	Dumptruck, just copy the changes around lines 33
[23:48	<Dumptruck>	I like gusty
[23:48	<Stormx2>	justin__: Deluge.

[23:49	<seamus7_>	orb2: the Effects Tab in Appearances will then have a Custom / Preferences option
[23:49	<cesar_>	asl everyone
[23:49	<scguy318>	justin___: i know the former is Windows, but Wine ;)
[23:49	<pyrak>	my installation crashed 3/4 of the way through
[23:49	<justin__>	Ahhh lot's of suggestions, thanks guys, I'll check them all out.
[23:49	<pyrak>	how do i go about doing something like a repair installation?
[23:49	<pierigno>	Hi all
[23:49	<CroiX>	So, now that Gutsy is released, how often can we expect updates--and should we expect these updates to add additional hardware support?
[23:49	<Stormx2>	garu: it'll work on other versions...
[23:49	<pyrak>	can i do that without overwriting my data?
[23:49	<caner>	what is the problem with nvidia-glx it is extremely slow on my machine geforce go 7200  doesnt matter i run compiz or not.
[23:49	<cesar_>	i'm trying to turn my girlfriend to ubuntu
[23:49	<CroiX>	I ask because my hardware is pretty new, and is not really fully supported yet.
[23:49	<cesar_>	she'll be a hot chick that uses linux
[23:49	<pierigno>	i'm having problem during Gutsy installation...
[23:49	<Stormx2>	cesar_: #ubuntu-offtopic please.
[23:49	<garu>	Stormx2 its ok, just finished erasing it...thanks ;)
[23:49	<frank_>	numus: you can try sudo nvidia-xconfig then restart X
[23:49	<pwnt->	so anybody is well experienced in backuping the /home/username ? I try to do that for ages and always getting errors in both rsync & cp
[23:49	<Dumptruck>	it looks exactly the same as what I have
[23:49	<Slart>	cesar_: there is an offtopic channel for that stuff.. this channel is crowded enough as it is
[23:50	<pierigno>	ubiquity freezes calling gparted
[23:50	<telexicon>	I am trying to run a portscan but nmap consistently hangs when running scans
[23:50	<seamus7_>	justin__: Deluge is excellent ... download and install the latest at deluge-torrent.org ... version 5.5-2
[23:50	<tck0>	where are the transparency settings for compiz that's installed by default in 7.10 ?
[23:50	<cesar_>	well no one is listening to my problems
[23:50	<Stormx2>	pwnt-: cp -av usually does it for me
[23:50	<src>	Dumptruck, do a page refresh
[23:50	<t|om>	Jordan_U: I installed the wizarpen driver the manual way like described in the wiki. Do I really report a bug then?
[23:50	<numus>	frank_ can i make the boardname nvidia in xorg.conf or should i keep it versa
[23:50	<Squid_>	does anyone have ever used a mix CD audio and data on ubuntu I can not see the tracks sound juicer dos not play it either see the tracks
[23:50	<numus>	err vesa
[23:50	<cesar_>	ubuntu is basically broken now, i have to back up everything and do a clean install :(
[23:50	<tass>	scquy318: well, testdisk is only if i had a backup :/
[23:50	<LiMaO>	where do i configure/see installed joysticks/joypads on gutsy?
[23:50	<tass>	another idea?
=== CroiX is now known as VousDeux
[23:50	<pwnt->	Stormx2: I try doing it to my external HDD. and i keep getting these errors in both cp & rsync,. http://pastebin.com/m4a3f4867
[23:50	<Stormx2>	cesar_: Your girlfriend using linux is not something that should be addressed here.
[23:50	<dredhammer>	can anyone tell me what i need to install to have kde programs look like they did in feisty, they for some reason look really ugly in gutsy
[23:50	<Slart>	cesar_: I didn't even see your question.. what was the problem?
[23:50	<lucita>	hello
[23:50	<cesar_>	ok, chill
[23:50	<Stormx2>	pwnt-: Try using sudo? ;)
[23:50	<Dumptruck>	sorry I did - still the same - sorry I don't mean to be such a bother
[23:51	<frank_>	numus: the driver in the section device should be "nvidia"
[23:51	<cesar_>	Slart: the upgrade manager gets multiple errors, login, passwd, adduser, among many other programs cannot be installed
[23:51	<scguy318>	tass: well, I think that's really your only choice
[23:51	<numus>	frank_ the driver is but the board says vesa
[23:51	<lucita>	I have just upgrade my 7.04 to 7.10 and i have lost the sound, any ideas_
[23:51	<src>	Dumptruck, do you see the 2 lines that start with "map"?
[23:51	<pierigno>	the program cannot access my disks...it seems strange as I can however navigate the file system in livecd environment
[23:51	<Slart>	cesar_: are you using some kind of weird mirror?
[23:51	<pwnt->	Stormx2: I did, same :)
[23:51	<SirBob1701>	is pidgin not saving settings for anyone else?
[23:51	<Dumptruck>	no
[23:51	<src>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41236/
[23:51	<scguy318>	tass: there is Rescubuntu
[23:51	<cesar_>	all i did was click on the update manager
[23:51	<Joikast>	Hello
[23:51	<quodlibetor>	I'm having problems connecting to a WPA network
[23:52	<cesar_>	and at the top it said that a new ubuntu was available, so iclicked on upgrade
[23:52	<quodlibetor>	also hello
[23:52	<Stormx2>	cesar_: Any idea why? open a terminal and do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --assume-yes dist-upgrade"
[23:52	<numus>	frank_ i messed up my monitor settings though
[23:52	<kynes>	where can I find a Pidgin log about a crash caused by my plugin?
[23:52	<Jordan_U>	t|om, I guess not, the wiki should be fixed or a bug report sent to the developer of the driver itself
[23:52	<frank_>	numus: you mean the boardname? starnge
[23:52	<Joikast>	Can someone please help me to upgrade my graphics card drivers?
[23:52	<Slart>	cesar_: please put the nick of the person you're addressing first on the line.. helps see your messages
[23:52	<seamus7_>	lucita: go to volume preferences and make sure the correct driver is being used ... maybe it got switched over somehow
[23:52	<cesar_>	stormx2: its in the middle of updating right now, can i do that?
[23:52	<fant>	When i upgraded to 710 i no longer have a network icon in my gnome-panel  ... so i have to manually configure my wireless settings in the shell to get access to it.  Anyone know how to fix it
[23:52	<sulan>	this is driving me insane: I upgraded to Gutsy yesterday and now I can't login to vsftpd using SSL: ls: Fatal error: gnutls_record_recv: A record packet with illegal version was received.
[23:52	<Stormx2>	cesar_: probably not. Wait for your updates to finish.
[23:52	<numus>	brb frank_) going to restart then i have to leave for a little
[23:52	<numus>	thanks though
[23:52	<src>	Dumptruck, you see them now http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41236/
[23:53	<Jordan_U>	fant, Try running "nm-applet &"
[23:53	<Slart>	fant: we could switch computers.. I'm having a hard time getting rid of that icon.. always keeps coming back =)
[23:53	<K3nt>	hmm. for the cube effect, how do i keep it from flip-flopping after i change desktops. is that called timestep?
[23:53	<PovAddict>	any idea how to get an SD card reader working?
[23:53	<Dumptruck>	yes
[23:53	<Stormx2>	K3nt: #ubuntu-effects please.
[23:53	<Dumptruck>	thank you
[23:53	<fant>	haha .. thanks
[23:53	<K3nt>	kk thanks
[23:53	<lucita>	<seamus7_>	no suitable driver
[23:53	<sulan>	this is under x86_64
[23:53	<src>	Dumptruck, you can also change root (hd1,0) to rootnoverify hd(1,0)
[23:53	<lucita>	but it was working under 7.04
[23:53	<t|om>	Jordan_U: IK, I think the best way is reporting this to the Wiki author, thx
[23:53	<Slart>	K3nt, Stormx2: I think ubuntu-effects has moved to #compiz-fusion.. there might be a redirect
[23:54	<Dumptruck>	what what?
[23:54	<Dumptruck>	I mean wait what
[23:54	<fant>	jordan_u:  that just returns [1] 9616 in the shell but doesnt start it
[23:54	<Dumptruck>	is that a needed change?  How do I write it?
[23:54	<seamus7_>	lucita: maybe you need to enable certain option in order to adjust the volume .. sometimes they are turned down and must be manually increased
[23:54	<src>	Dumptruck, try it like this and if it doesnt work we'll see... Just add the 2 lines I added
[23:55	<quodlibetor>	anybody: my network manager is discovering my WPA network, asking me for a password, and then not logging in
[23:55	<seamus7_>	lucita: sometimes a reboot works if it's just a one time fluke
[23:55	<Dumptruck>	ok I'll be back in a moment
[23:55	<pyrak>	is there a way i can do a restore install without losing my files?
[23:55	<pyrak>	my edgy upgrade crashed 3/4 of the way through, and im afraid some things may not have installed right
[23:55	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Make a backup of /home and reinstall.
[23:55	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Ah, don't worry, that can be sorted out. Can you boot the system?
[23:55	<Blama>	Ljl, Are you there?
[23:55	<pyrak>	storm2, yeah, im on it now
[23:56	<lucita>	<seamus7_>	rebooted twice, the control volumen, the bars dont appear, looks like no card was recognised
[23:56	<pyrak>	storm2, i meant gutsy upgrade, by the way
[23:56	<speaker219>	My 7.10 Gusty download is at 95% :p excited
[23:56	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Well, you should be able to resume the upgrade.
[23:56	<pyrak>	storm2, it says it's already upgraded
[23:56	<pyrak>	storm2, and i seem to have most of the features
[23:56	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Well then, you'd better trust it :)
[23:56	<Tchaka>	I am wondering if it's a good idea to update ubuntu 7.04 ->	7.10. Apparently there are still some bugs and several people have problems with this new version, no?
[23:56	<bulmer>	quodlibetor: without the wpa, does it work?
[23:56	<pyrak>	storm2, but when i boot up the screen is just brown
[23:56	<fant>	Jordan_U: did you get that message ?
[23:56	<quodlibetor>	bulmer. nope
[23:56	<Shapeshifter>	I don't _really_ get the excitment about gutsy. I didn't notice anything significantly different until now...
[23:56	<quodlibetor>	almost, once
[23:56	<pyrak>	storm2, when it used to have the thing with the little icons and the bongoes playing
[23:56	<Stormx2>	pyrak: To be sure, do this: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --assume-yes dist-upgrade <--that will do any remaining upgrades
[23:57	<quodlibetor>	bulmer, but then it stopped
[23:57	<bulmer>	quodlibetor: then get the unencrypted version work first
[23:57	<Slart>	Tchaka: if you don't need it right away I would wait a week or two.. let other people deal with the new problems.. update faqs etc etc
[23:57	<pyrak>	storm2, ok i'll try, thanks
[23:57	<LjL>	Blama: yes
[23:57	<seamus7_>	lucita: so you've right clicked on the volume applet in the panel and chosen preferences ... palyed around with them .. the opened up volume control and made sure nothing was set to mute or turned down ... then tested other preferences ... ?

[23:57	<Stormx2>	lavender_dream: Who was that for?
[23:57	<Blama>	LjL, do you want all ten or so lines from the " mount | grep "on /" "?
[23:58	<myusrnm>	libmp3lame.so ?
[23:58	<myusrnm>	what is that?
[23:58	<quodlibetor>	bulmer: that makes so much sense i feel like i've tried it, i'll brb if it doesn't start working
[23:58	<Tchaka>	Slart, I think I will wait for one month, and then maybe I will update
[23:58	<codecaine>	anybody else suffering from slow internet connection on gusty?
[23:58	<Tigerman>	hello
[23:58	<Stormx2>	myusrnm: A file? ;D
[23:58	<Tigerman>	i have a problem
[23:58	<lavender_dream>	Stormx2: myself, sorry if I'm not following an obscure protocol with it...
[23:58	<pyrak>	storm2, hm, it says i'm fine...
[23:58	<LjL>	Blama: no. because i asked for the output of       mount | grep "on / "          . there is a space after the slash and before the quotation mark.
[23:58	<fant>	Anyone know how to make sure the nm-applet is starting with X ?
[23:58	<Cable86>	codecaine: nope, my internet is fine
[23:58	<pyrak>	storm2, how do you enable the neat cube thingey?
[23:58	<pyrak>	storm2, i still just have the "desktop effects" button
[23:58	<Stormx2>	lavender_dream: not really that obscure. This channel moves fast. Please use /msg ubotu if the message is only for yourself, thanks :)
[23:58	<lavender_dream>	Stormx2: thank you, will do that next time.
[23:59	<Tigerman>	i have lost my Restart and Shutdown buttons... how can i enable them?
[23:59	<r0b->	whats a program in Ubuntu to burn a bootable ISO
[23:59	<myusrnm>	my computer needs libmp3lame.so to run a program, what is this / where do i find it ?
[23:59	<seamus7_>	lucita: notice in Volume Control under File .. there is the option to change the device ..
[23:59	<Slart>	Tchaka: sounds like a good plan.. as you said, there seems to be some problems.. but I'm sure they'll be sorted out in due time
[23:59	<Blama>	LjL, this is hard because I have to boot out of windows and into Ubuntu, change the settings and then do it.. and I cant stay in it because I cant get internet on Ubuntu yet...
[23:59	<lucita>	<seamus>	i go to System>preference>sounds and then the tab called Devices is empty

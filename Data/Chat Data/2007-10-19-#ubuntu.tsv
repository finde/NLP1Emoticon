[none]	[00:03]	<Lamego>	I mean, installing the older version and performing the upgrade, will not resolve your hw support problem
[none]	[00:03]	<younan1>	bluefox83, you sure its just a bandwidth issue? I've tried it repeatedly on one computer and keep getting this problem, but on another computer connected to the same internet connetion, it worked the first time

[none]	[00:31]	<barnaby>	<sebastes>no just my video card- I'm a little leery about upgrading till they work out some bugs
[none]	[00:31]	<kitche>	flagel: launchpad
[none]	[00:31]	<fjleon>	pradeep:  64 bit is useless unless you have more than 4 gb of ram
[none]	[00:31]	<element>	how would i update to gusty
[positive]	[00:31]	<murkyMurk>	MTughan: 00:30 tomorrow here
[none]	[00:31]	<bmk789>	pradeep: then yes that is the right one to download for 64bit
[none]	[00:31]	<xerawx>	soundray: no actually i'm not
[positive]	[00:31]	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: that's already set how I want it
[none]	[00:31]	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, you know that in the beginning everyone wants to download
[none]	[00:31]	<sebastes>	barnaby: The open source ATI driver works fine for me
[none]	[00:32]	<LjL>	xerawx: that's partly due to people making irrelevant statement rather than just support questions and answers
[positive]	[00:32]	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: the sandy background appears only after login

[none]	[00:32]	<karnage42>	yeah, the restricted ati driver is working great for me in 6.10

[none]	[00:32]	<MTughan>	murkyMurk: West coast of Africa?
[none]	[00:32]	<fjleon>	pradeep: there isn't an advantage otherwise of going 64 bit, software will not work, use 32 bit
[none]	[00:32]	<Vista|G33Z3R>	element put live cd in  drive  browse the web  while you install
[none]	[00:32]	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, I know this, but it would be nice if you could select your download locations
[none]	[00:32]	<soundray>	fjleon: that's not true. 64bit is also faster for memory-intensive apps
[none]	[00:32]	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, I took about 2 hours to have Ubuntu upgraded
[none]	[00:32]	<nickrud>	xerawx: use xchat (not xchat gnome) and right click the channel tab to turn off join/part

[none]	[00:33]	<magic_ninja>	element: you got ur mic working in steam
[none]	[00:33]	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, when you upgrade I think it's not possible to do that
[none]	[00:33]	<sebastes>	barnaby: Yeah, I upgraded using the alternate cd to avoid hammering the servers more, just tell it to not update using the latest online sources
[none]	[00:33]	<element>	my mic works in vent
[none]	[00:33]	<|Flood|>	ooooooook then i'm a install it myself in a VPC VM and home for the best
[none]	[00:33]	<soundray>	fjleon: sorry, you've got it wrong.
[none]	[00:33]	<fjleon>	pradeep: forget the problems of 64 and just use 32 bit, all your software will work at the same speed
[none]	[00:33]	<Vista|G33Z3R>	element have you burned the live cd as an iso?
[positive]	[00:33]	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: yes, I'm perplexed as well

[none]	[00:33]	<bmk789>	sisseck: no
[none]	[00:33]	<Mark76>	TA Bmk
[none]	[00:33]	<soundray>	fjleon: memory throughput is faster with 64, even if you have less than 4GB
[none]	[00:33]	<kitche>	fjleon: 64bit is useless to a desktop user completely
[none]	[00:33]	<magic_ninja>	element: really hoping to get it working under cs
[positive]	[00:33]	<cousin_luigi>	nickrud: and it's not there if I skip gdm and do a startx from init 3
[none]	[00:33]	<nickrud>	cousin_luigi: I can't log out right now to check for myself, sorry
[none]	[00:33]	<barnaby>	sebastes: thanks. No problems yet?
[none]	[00:33]	<sebastes>	barnaby: The only issue I had was the lack of window borders, you just need to turn compiz off and install compizconfig-settings-manager
[none]	[00:33]	<|Flood|>	magic_ninja element has a mic problem too but that's all i know
[none]	[00:33]	<Abraxas_>	now this is odd.. NONE of the NVIDIA blocks in my Xorg.0.log show errors
[none]	[00:33]	<d2dchat>	southafrikanse, yea i was just saying it would be nice to be able to choose the medium for which you download the upgrades
[none]	[00:33]	<Abraxas_>	so I don't get it
[positive]	[00:33]	<cousin_luigi>	thanks anyway nickrud:)
[none]	[00:33]	<MTughan>	kitche: Unless you're running video editing or something.
[none]	[00:33]	<pradeep>	fjleon, I read someplace in the forums that the package difference between 64 and 32 bit is only 1-2%
[none]	[00:33]	<murkyMurk>	element: soz ventrillo in linux?
[none]	[00:33]	<pazsion>	HEY, gnome is trying to connect during install, there is no connection..how do i bypassthis?
[none]	[00:34]	<element>	soz?
[none]	[00:34]	<soundray>	kitche: there are desktop users who run video encoding, 3D processing and similar stuff
[none]	[00:34]	<sisseck>	bmk789 ok the problem is that i cant install any programs from the add/remove windows. they all say something like this: TuxMath cannot be installed on your computer type (i386)
[none]	[00:34]	<pradeep>	fjleon, will I be missing out on a lot of packages?
[none]	[00:34]	<southafrikanse>	d2dchat, oh ok
[none]	[00:34]	<element>	i got ventrilo in linux
[none]	[00:34]	<Abraxas_>	in fact, absolutely nothing in that log greps for (EE)
[none]	[00:34]	<barnaby>	sebastes: Yeah, I heard there were some compiz issues.
[none]	[00:34]	<soundray>	pradeep: it can vary *very* widely depending on what the app does.
[none]	[00:34]	<bmk789>	sisseck: what machine is this?
[none]	[00:34]	<fjleon>	soundray: i dont think so, it takes the same cpu cycles to address the first 32 bits of address space, if you would need to address more space then of course 64 bit is faster
[none]	[00:34]	<Vista|G33Z3R>	element burn the cd as an iso
[none]	[00:34]	<element>	and i got counter strike source and CoD working in linux
[none]	[00:34]	<Dan2552>	hey guys, new to ubuntu; got the new 7.10. Installed the ATI driver with the restricted driver manager - but I can't enable desktop effects, i get a composition error
[none]	[00:34]	<wizard__>	hello, is ubuntu safe to upgrade?
[none]	[00:34]	<kitche>	soundray: yes but those aren't desktop users but then again I know someoen that does all that and doesn't use a 64bit machine
[none]	[00:34]	<murkyMurk>	element: is it as an official package or do people still use my old howto?
[none]	[00:35]	<fjleon>	pradeep: well, java, flash and such don't play nice, some other too but i dont install much 3rd party
[none]	[00:35]	<pipegeek>	Well, this is interesting---with compiz enabled in gutsy, alt-shift-tab (reverse alt-tab) doesn't work.
[none]	[00:35]	<element>	i just used wine
[none]	[00:35]	<element>	lol
[none]	[00:35]	<sisseck>	bmk789 a Znote6214W laptop. intel dualcore
[none]	[00:35]	<Abraxas_>	hmm..ok...I'm using Xgl... is there a wya to undo that in Gutsy?
[none]	[00:35]	<element>	didnt need a howto
[none]	[00:35]	<soundray>	kitche: I'm a desktop user who does all that.
[none]	[00:35]	<jazz>	soo nobodies no
[none]	[00:35]	<jagsUT>	i am looking for a .torrent of ubuntu 7.10.....anyone have such a link in here
[none]	[00:35]	<jagsUT>	i can not find one
[none]	[00:35]	<bmk789>	sisseck: 64bit OS or 32?
[none]	[00:35]	<element>	i wish there was a way to make fonts normal in xfire
[none]	[00:35]	<murkyMurk>	element: lol...must've come on leaps and bounds in teh last 5 years lmao
[positive]	[00:35]	<pradeep>	soundray, fjleon thanks .. I'll just give it a try. I can always wipe it off and go for the 32 bit. Thanks :)
[none]	[00:35]	<MTughan>	jagsUT: You can find them on Ubuntu.com.
[none]	[00:35]	<Dan2552>	jagsUT: look around in the download section on the site, I found one in the end
[none]	[00:35]	<pazsion>	need to turn off gnome....
[none]	[00:35]	<sisseck>	bmk789: 32 bit
[none]	[00:35]	<jagsUT>	aight....
[none]	[00:36]	<soundray>	fjleon: it's not only about addressing, it's also about moving the data between RAM and CPU.
[none]	[00:36]	<Vista|G33Z3R>	demonoid has  ubuntu 7.10

[none]	[00:36]	<kitche>	soundray: true but that's not really a desktop user really a desktop user is one that just uses the internet and email pretty much
[none]	[00:36]	<karnage42>	releases.ubuntu.com/7.10 has some torrent links
[none]	[00:36]	<nickrud>	soundray: what do you recommend for copying non-encrypted video dvd's?
[none]	[00:36]	<southafrikanse>	I'm trying to put WIndows to run by default. Can someone tel me where do I get the default number so I can do so?
[none]	[00:36]	<murkyMurk>	pazsion: pretty much stuck waiting for it, Will be better tomorrow when teh demand is less
[none]	[00:36]	<fjleon>	soundray: how would a 64 bit  cpu help with speed? i can't believe you without a good article supporting your theory
[none]	[00:36]	<bmk789>	sisseck: just a sec
[none]	[00:36]	<tag>	How's the release?
[none]	[00:36]	<MTughan>	Dan2552: You should've seen #ubuntu-release-party last night...

[none]	[00:37]	<ubotwo>	bbyman: If you installed a Tribe/Beta/RC version of Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon) and have been keeping it up to date, then you are already running the latest version of Gutsy. To make sure, type « sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade » in a console.

[none]	[00:37]	<fjleon>	it's not like you have more bandwidth for the cpu-ram interconnection (of course if the cpu is just faster then it will)
[none]	[00:37]	<pazsion>	murkymurk: need to bypas this so i can install to HD
[none]	[00:37]	<zaphodmcmillan>	but dont want to use boot camp

[none]	[00:37]	<MTughan>	zaphodmcmillan: You need Boot Camp then.
[none]	[00:37]	<pradeep>	fjleon, soundray i read in a lot of places that 64 bit improves performance by 30% approx

[none]	[00:38]	<fjleon>	pradeep: that doesn't make any sense at all. 32 bit OS would be dead by now
[none]	[00:38]	<wizard__>	keep hearing java and other hiccups with gutsy, is that true?
[none]	[00:38]	<Draggin>	Hello hello. New problems...  Tonight, when I wanted to boot into Ubuntu, it went past the logo screen, but before it got to the login manager, the screen just went black and stayed black.  In the virtual console, I then saw that it was complaining about a USB device.  After manually switching them, I finally found that it was my little 56K modem.  Now this modem has been on my system since the day I installed Ubuntu and it's never complai

[none]	[00:38]	<apollo2011>	I am assuming I can't update my repos because the servers are getting hit pretty hard. How do I set up a mirror in my repository list?
[none]	[00:38]	<MTughan>	zaphodmcmillan: As I know, no Linux distro can natively boot from EFI, which is the boot system the Intel Macs use. They all use BIOS, which Boot Camp emulates.
[positive]	[00:38]	<soundray>	pradeep: like I said: it depends on the application, the amount of memory I/O it has to perform, and the extent to which it is optimized for 64 bit architectures.
[none]	[00:38]	<axjv>	capiira: If you want to know, the program's name was 'Pie3D'
[none]	[00:38]	<Dan2552>	no idea if anyone answered my question but there were loads of people talking ---- hey guys, new to ubuntu; got the new 7.10. Installed the ATI driver with the restricted driver manager - but I can't enable desktop effects, i get a composition error

[positive]	[00:39]	<pradeep>	soundray, isn't the 64 bit ubuntu build optimized for the 64-bit? :)
[positive]	[00:39]	<speeb>	I can't seem to add some items to my panels.  Specifically Search, User Switcher, and Weather.  They just don't show up on the panel when I add them. :-(
[none]	[00:39]	<ARJones>	Dan2552: Your instructions on what to do about that are there
[none]	[00:39]	<soundray>	Dan2552: I get that too on an Xpress 200M. It's just not compatible with desktop effects.
[none]	[00:39]	<bmk789>	sisseck: have you modified the sources.list or anything?
[none]	[00:39]	<jazz>	I will ask again.

[none]	[00:39]	<pazsion>	how do i tell ubuntu live cd not to look for a connection? so i can install to HD
[none]	[00:39]	<soundray>	pradeep: you're not listening properly.
[none]	[00:39]	<ARJones>	soundray: That is incorrect. I am running the 200M right now with compiz and 0 problems. You just have to follow the documentation

[none]	[00:40]	<nickrud>	Dan2552: you need to install xserver-xgl as well, log out, log in and then alt-f2 compiz --replace && emerald --replace . ATI doesn't support compiz without finagleing
[none]	[00:40]	<Jimb_>	Ati always has probs with composite...need to wait for better drivers
[negative]	[00:40]	<Dan2552>	doesn't work? It's a x1600 ;(

Here's my pastebin: http://pastebin.ca/741799 and the tutorial I followed: http://andy.hillhome.org/blog/2006/09/27/logitech-mx-revolution-in-linux/ - I don't think I'm using evdev correctly, as my keyboard is going crazy.

[none]	[00:53]	<soundray>	mikeo2: all you need on that one is some download manager that processes a list of files. Which is where ademan's advice might come in handy.
[none]	[00:53]	<boubbin>	!ccsm
[none]	[00:53]	<ubotwo>	To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Gutsy(7.10) install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' - A new option will appear in your appearance properties - see also !compiz

[none]	[00:56]	<nickrud>	flick2: try clt-alt-f8, you should be able to see a log of the install, maybe there's a clue there

[none]	[01:05]	<brandon>	not synaptic
[none]	[01:05]	<Flyzoola>	and getting frustrated haha
[none]	[01:05]	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan: kk, how do I proceed? I've downloaded a driver from NVidia's site btw...

[none]	[01:05]	<foug>	I am using Debian Etch currently, I plan on installing Ubuntu 7.10. During installation, to I have the option to important files/folders over?
[none]	[01:06]	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: you don't need to do that, install nvidia-glx-new
[positive]	[01:06]	<Cryoniq>	What to do when gutsy attacks with a banana? :)
[none]	[01:06]	<flick>	"cousin_luigi: i have rebooted, it's working fine except when i try to add XChat it says ""The list of applications is not available"""
[none]	[01:06]	<nrp>	After upgrading to feisty, I can no longer get into gnome.  it cycles back into console and back into gdm after i log in, and it gives an error that i'm missing libresmgr.so.0.9.8
[negative]	[01:06]	<hb>	no fakeraid support eh? :(
[none]	[01:06]	<danlock2>	okay, so i can't apt-get anything.
[none]	[01:06]	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: do what cousin_luigi said, i think that's a better bet
[none]	[01:06]	<boubbin>	so AIGLX is enabled if im on gutsy ?
[none]	[01:06]	<foug>	danlock2: are you root?

[none]	[01:06]	<ademan>	danlock2: i think the repositories are under incredible stress right now
[negative]	[01:06]	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: not sure then...real grub is usually installed on the drive, but not a partition. Windows bootloader is installed on the partition. is your bootable partition still there, and it the win partition in the same numerical location?
[none]	[01:06]	<cousin_luigi>	flick: then do a reload
[none]	[01:06]	<nrp>	err, i mean, upgrading from feisty
[none]	[01:06]	<flick>	ok
[none]	[01:06]	<danlock2>	ademan: i think so as well, they time out a lot.
[none]	[01:06]	<kitche>	boubbin: it was enabled in feisty also
[positive]	[01:06]	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	yeah the repos are like about to explode
[none]	[01:06]	<dave>	question, are the gutsy upgrade repo's real bogged down or is my computer being a @#$%@#$
[negative]	[01:06]	<Think_Differentl>	Weee. repos are terribly slow. can't even download the package info :/
[none]	[01:06]	<foug>	I am using Debian Etch currently, I plan on installing Ubuntu 7.10. During installation, to I have the option to important files/folders over?
[none]	[01:06]	<newbie1>	anyone know why IBM T61 Laptop sound breaks on upgrade? I was wondering if theres a program i can run to reconfigure my alsa sound?
[positive]	[01:06]	<kitche>	Think_Differentl: read the topic :)
[positive]	[01:07]	<hb>	PASthelod: Yes it does, but I can boot my system without a boot loader :/

[none]	[01:07]	<flick>	cousin_luigi: Software Sources doesn't have a reload button, has a Revert button which is disabled
[none]	[01:07]	<Flyzoola>	ok. So I've been trying to get software to broadcast to an internet radio. I installed gnump3d amongst many other apps, but nothing has worked. I installed GNUMP3d from Synaptic, but I don't know how to run it. Shouldn't there be like... a launcher icon or something for it? This is all so confusing
[none]	[01:07]	<dave>	2nd question, got a router that keeps dropping my cable connection, anyone think it might work better as a switch with dhcpd installed on one of the computers?
[none]	[01:07]	<newbie1>	K
[none]	[01:07]	<kitche>	soundray: ubotwo is gone
[none]	[01:07]	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu.
[none]	[01:07]	<danlock2>	cuz i was like UGH! i can't update, and was hoping that it was just the repos dying a bit.
[none]	[01:07]	<Intrepd>	ls
[none]	[01:07]	<cousin_luigi>	flick: sorry I meant after you selected them
[none]	[01:08]	<Cryoniq>	Does the compisite extension is not available mean that fglrx and ati9800pro isn't working for compiz?
[none]	[01:08]	<brandon>	there was supposedly a simpler install/remove programs application here somewhere, but i don't have it. i don't mean synaptic
[none]	[01:08]	<cousin_luigi>	flick: just do a sudo apt-get update from console then
[positive]	[01:08]	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, on my RAID array I HAVE (have faith.. have faith.. :)) just 2 NTFS partitions .. and neither of them are bootable .. etc .. an on one of them there is the virtual partition (just an NTFS file) .. and grub is in a separate file
[none]	[01:08]	<soundray>	kitche: can't keep up... thanks
[none]	[01:08]	<Nuked>	the repos still arent working... wow... must be a lot of people upgrading today
[none]	[01:08]	<hb>	does grub have to install on a IDE source even if SATA is selected as the primary boot source in the bios?

[positive]	[01:08]	<kitche>	Nuked: yes like it usually is that why some of us wait a few weeks :)
[none]	[01:08]	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	ademan and cousin_luigi: did it, should I reboot, restart X, what?
[none]	[01:08]	<PAStheLoD>	hb, you can build a kernel for yourself with dmraid and device-mapper support
[none]	[01:08]	<foug>	I am using Debian Etch currently, I plan on installing Ubuntu 7.10. During installation, to I have the option to important files/folders over?

[none]	[01:08]	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: sorry what was it about?
[none]	[01:08]	<Blama>	Hey all, is there any reason why I would not be able to use my USB keyboard with Ubuntu? It works fine Windows and in the BiOS menu.
[none]	[01:08]	<Nuked>	kitche: its also why some of us upgrade a few weeks early
[none]	[01:09]	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: installed nvidia-glx-new, what's next?
[none]	[01:09]	<danlock2>	foug: create a new partiton to store thos?e files on for the time being
[none]	[01:09]	<KeKoS>	hi how can i run compiz fusion in gutsy?

[none]	[01:09]	<danlock2>	?
[none]	[01:09]	<ademan>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: might as well reboot since it would hopefully load the new driver module
[none]	[01:09]	<soundray>	Blama: not really. Have you tried a plug cycle?
[negative]	[01:09]	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: so your win system partition is hdb or sda?
[none]	[01:09]	<Flyzoola>	is there anybody that I can PM about my problem, perhaps?
[none]	[01:09]	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: you have to activate it from the restricted drivers manager
[none]	[01:09]	<flick>	cousin_luigi: right thanks... i think sudo apt-get update did the trick, stopped at 50% though, probably the server is under stress
[none]	[01:09]	<foug>	danlock2: so there is no way to import them during installation?
[none]	[01:09]	<WorkingOnWise>	sdb i meant
[none]	[01:09]	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	compiz should run by default in gusty, unless you heve terribe video acceleration
[none]	[01:09]	<danlock2>	foug: i'm not sure.
[negative]	[01:10]	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: hdb or sdb
[none]	[01:10]	<soundray>	Flyzoola: please have a bit of patience, and repost your error description if you don't get a response at first.
[none]	[01:10]	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, hda ..
[none]	[01:10]	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: I only see one driver there, and I already activated it earlier
[none]	[01:10]	<WorkingOnWise>	and where it the fubar partition table?
[none]	[01:10]	<flick>	HOLOGRAPHICpizza: how do i confirm if compiz is running?
[none]	[01:10]	<r0b->	the mirrors are still slow lol
[none]	[01:10]	<codecaine>	I can't get my laptop on the network on a static ip I did nmap -sP to see if its on the router and I see it on there
[none]	[01:10]	<codecaine>	any sugesstions
[positive]	[01:10]	<hb>	PASthelod: I'm not using nvraid i's via and i'd prefer to use the ubuntu system.  I have several nodes I need to configure and I'd like the process to be as automated as possible (install cd).  I have the feeling that the alternate cd will do it, but that i'm doing something wrong.  I just dont know what
[none]	[01:10]	<HOLOGRAPHICpizza>	ummm... i dont really know lol
[none]	[01:10]	<cousin_luigi>	flick: it would be wise to do a mirror scan now, to find out the faster one
[positive]	[01:10]	<|Flood|>	50% :)
[none]	[01:10]	<Cryoniq>	Anyone know anything about this ---> The Composite extension is not available
[none]	[01:10]	<PAStheLoD>	WorkingOnWise, hda2 actually .. totally separate drive .. and I've a little 50 megs FAT partition on hda1 just for these purposes ..
[positive]	[01:10]	<|Flood|>	50% :) in the VM :)
[none]	[01:10]	<Flyzoola>	ok. So I've been trying to get software to broadcast to an internet radio. I installed gnump3d amongst many other apps, but nothing has worked.

[none]	[01:11]	<the_darkside_986>	the reason: i gotta reburn the gutsy iso that is located on my freebsd partition. i do not trust freebsd to burn stuff well
[none]	[01:11]	<JMilton>	hi. i tried apt-get installing some packages i already have, and they were set as manually installed. they were dependencies of a metapackage, and i want them to stay that way - how do i flag them as being automatically installed again?
[none]	[01:11]	<x_dimitri>	what's the alternative to chasing down dependencies (which in turn have dependencies) when trying to install a package?
[none]	[01:11]	<flick>	cousin_luigi: thanks
[none]	[01:11]	<soundray>	Blama: ah, that's usually flaky hardware or a dissonance between the device and the hub. Can you plug it into another socket?
[positive]	[01:11]	<PAStheLoD>	ZaphodBeeblebrox, I don't understand your problem completely. I've just replied to one of your messages but I haven't got the first part .. so if you tell me I can try :)
[none]	[01:11]	<cousin_luigi>	ZaphodBeeblebrox: either a reboot or a X11 restart with ctrl alt backspace
[none]	[01:12]	<kitche>	the_darkside_986: then you shouldn't trust linux to burn stuff either
[positive]	[01:12]	<PAStheLoD>	hb, well, good luck with VIA's .. more than I've got with nv's :]

[none]	[01:13]	<ademan>	danlock2: hope not, but i suppose that might be it
[positive]	[01:13]	<hb>	PASthelod: there has to be something obvious in the install process i'm missing.  guess I'll find it on my own
[none]	[01:13]	<caner>	<danlock2> bogged? what does that mean? are you also having problems?
[none]	[01:13]	<Blama>	soundray, I have tried all the USB ports on my computer but all of them gave the same error. I know it isn't a problem with the ports because my USB mouse works fine.
[none]	[01:13]	<ademan>	ergh, i guess i'll check the cd for errors first
[none]	[01:13]	<Flyzoola>	ok. So I've been trying to get software to broadcast to an internet radio. I installed gnump3d amongst many other apps, but nothing has worked. I installed GNUMP3d from Synaptic, but I don't know how to run it. Shouldn't there be like... a launcher icon or something for it?
[none]	[01:13]	<danlock2>	caner: they are extremely slow, i can't even apt-get update
[none]	[01:13]	<danlock2>	can other people at least apt-get update?
[negative]	[01:13]	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: hda2 would be partition 2 on physical drive 1....oh I see, you are calling physical drive 1 as hda1 and drive 2 as hda2, while I am calling drive 1 as hda and drive 2 as hdb, right?

[none]	[01:14]	<gravemind>	Hey everyone, I'm trying to figure out if I can use the live cd to upgrade from feisty to gutsy. Is that possible?
[none]	[01:14]	<soundray>	Flyzoola: you can get a list of installed programs with 'dpkg -L gnump3d'. Look for lines with 'bin' in the path. Also have a look at the docs in /usr/share/doc/gnump3d
[none]	[01:14]	<|box|>	apt-get install rtorrent?

[positive]	[01:17]	<WorkingOnWise>	PAStheLoD: it sounds like it will survive a reboot...but I'd hav a repair cd handy just incase. :)
[positive]	[01:17]	<soundray>	gravemind: you can also upgrade one, then copy the contents of /var/cache/apt/archives to the other machines.
[none]	[01:17]	<ZaphodBeeblebrox>	cousin_luigi: hold on

[none]	[01:47]	<vocx>	autumnx, GParted is easy to use. Just select delete or erase partition and create a new one in the unallocated space. You need to run from the Live CD or make sure your partitions are not mounted when attempting to to changes.

[none]	[02:10]	<eugo>	terminal
[none]	[02:11]	<crshman>	for example /dev/sda would become /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb would become /dev/sdc it's wierd
[none]	[02:11]	<ebirtaid>	eugo: does your terminal emulator support unicode?
[none]	[02:11]	<drama1981>	the extra packages dont get installoed. but if you choose to install something that is on the dvd it will pull it from the dvd instead of having to d/l it
[none]	[02:11]	<joshjosh>	bashveank, Awesome. I already have it installed, but i might grab the DVD iso just so i can install stuff if my connection goes down
[none]	[02:11]	<iobelisk>	is it possible to merge an existing partition to another existing partition while formatting?
[none]	[02:11]	<drama1981>	the dvd doesnt have the full repo on it though. but there are quite a few packages there
[negative]	[02:12]	<eugo>	on a windows box i run: scp -r user@bla:/mnt/whatever . and the folders in the windows dir are fucked
[none]	[02:12]	<|box|>	think ill download firestarter
[none]	[02:12]	<vocx>	iobelisk, no. You need to erase one partition and resize the other one to use the unallocated space left by the first one.
[none]	[02:12]	<eugo>	the char's are messed up
[none]	[02:12]	<bashveank>	iobelisk: you can delete one partition and make another one larger, providing they are next to eachother. For real mergin you would need to copy the data manualy
[none]	[02:12]	<ebirtaid>	so you're running windows?
[none]	[02:12]	<iobelisk>	would resizing result in data loss?
[none]	[02:12]	<eugo>	yea on this box
[none]	[02:12]	<monkey_instinct>	how can I do the upgrade with the cd?
[none]	[02:12]	<eugo>	the one that holds the files is a linux
[none]	[02:13]	<eugo>	but the files are on a windows partition
[none]	[02:13]	<bashveank>	iobelisk: Not if you're making it larger
[none]	[02:13]	<dngr>	hi.. does the xgl stuff work on the new livecd?
[none]	[02:13]	<vocx>	iobelisk, the risk is always there. But normally you should have no problem.
[none]	[02:13]	<tamgo>	I am going to ask the question of the day. I'm sure it's been ask tens, if not hundreds of times today, so I apologize in advance. How do I upgrade from the development branch to the stable version of gutsy?
[none]	[02:13]	<ebirtaid>	but you are running the commands from under linux or windows?
[negative]	[02:13]	<DShepherd>	monkey_instinct, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[none]	[02:13]	<techjim>	anyone understand why my toshiba laptop won't standby for the second time when I shut the lid?
[none]	[02:13]	<jarrod_>	anyone here beat gnuchess on easy?
[none]	[02:13]	<eugo>	windows
[none]	[02:13]	<drama1981>	if you already installed from the 700mb cd. then want to use the dvd as a temp repo you will need to to add it as a repo. sudo apt-cdrom (i believe)
[none]	[02:13]	<ebirtaid>	well then I dont know man ;p
[none]	[02:13]	<ebirtaid>	thats a windows problem
[none]	[02:13]	<vocx>	!bot
[none]	[02:13]	<monkey_instinct>	can I do the upgrade with an ISO file?
[none]	[02:13]	<demon_spork>	"where do I get the package ""emerald-themes"" from gutsy?"
[none]	[02:13]	<PurpZeY>	techjim: There should be a setting for that in System
[none]	[02:13]	<vocx>	monkey_instinct, no
[none]	[02:14]	<crshman>	any ideas?
[positive]	[02:14]	<kitche>	vocx: the bot is having a hard time tonight :P
[none]	[02:14]	<DShepherd>	drama1981, sudo apt-cdrom add
[none]	[02:14]	<iobelisk>	ok great! thank you! one last question please. is BIOS usually installed on the HDD or on the motherboard itself? reason i ask is i have a manufacturer partition on my drive and im not sure whether its a back up or the BIOS
[none]	[02:14]	<eugo>	"i did a ls /mnt/whatever and the filenames are like this: ""H\303\241k"", not ""Hák"""
[none]	[02:14]	<ebirtaid>	how are you even executing ls from windows
[none]	[02:14]	<dystopianray>	iobelisk: the mobo itself
[none]	[02:14]	<gnutron>	eugo: /etc/fstab sounds like it's mounting /mnt/Whatever without proper charset support.
[none]	[02:14]	<todkon>	monkey-instinct: run sudo update-manager
[none]	[02:14]	<vocx>	kitche, seems so. Do you know if it has been reported already?
[none]	[02:14]	<LjL>	iobelisk: it's in the motherboard.
[none]	[02:14]	<kitche>	eugo: its a UTF-8 encoding
[none]	[02:14]	<eugo>	and thats in the console, so i might start there
[none]	[02:14]	<flick>	what is the 'super' key?
[none]	[02:14]	<drama1981>	DShepherd yep thats it. thankx for correcting me. ive never had to use it but i knew it was something like that
[none]	[02:14]	<kitche>	vocx: LjL most likely knows it since he had his bot in here for a little bit
[none]	[02:14]	<dystopianray>	flick: the 'windows' or 'apple' key
[none]	[02:14]	<crshman>	the windows key @ flick
[none]	[02:14]	<tamgo>	"flick, that would be the ""windows"" key"
[none]	[02:14]	<eugo>	so how do i add my lang to the encoding?
[none]	[02:14]	<tamgo>	I am going to ask the question of the day. I'm sure it's been ask tens, if not hundreds of times today, so I apologize in advance. How do I upgrade from the development branch to the stable version of gutsy?
[none]	[02:14]	<eugo>	aaah
[none]	[02:15]	<DrUnKnMuNkY>	alright well my wireless is obviously sort of working.. it's now autoconnected to a network other than mine but i can't access any sort of wireless configuration screen
[none]	[02:15]	<LjL>	!test
[none]	[02:15]	<iobelisk>	cool! after a few months of dual booting now i can go say a permanent goodbye to windows!
[none]	[02:15]	<Jupp2>	monkey_instinct, you should be able to burn the iso and then update
[none]	[02:15]	<dystopianray>	tamgo: sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[02:15]	<dngr>	does the xgl stuff work on the new livecd? or does one have to install to hd?
[none]	[02:15]	<Creed>	Is there any plugin or program to have video as wallpaper on Ubuntu? Like DreamScene for Vista...
[none]	[02:15]	<kitche>	LjL: seems like it dies just like the repos tonight

[none]	[02:15]	<dystopianray>	dngr: I don't know about xgl, but the aiglx/compiz effects work right off the livecd
[none]	[02:15]	<kitche>	GamingX: this is it
[none]	[02:16]	<dngr>	dystopianray, how do you know if its working or not?
[none]	[02:16]	<flick>	"thanks... it says ""hold down <Control><Super> and move the mouse"" to create ripples, which doesn't seem to be working somehow"
[none]	[02:16]	<Cryoniq>	Weird.. installed the xorg-glx and restarted and it puked back at me to failsafe screen and driver config. So.. ATI9800Pro+fglrx+xorg glx = forget?

[none]	[02:18]	<KNY>	When I have compiz enabled, I can't resize my windows; do I need a plugin enabled/disabled?
[positive]	[02:18]	<vocx>	emeriste, this is a classic read-the-manual answer. You can't expect us to know. I'm not using it by the way, and I don't feel less secure.
[none]	[02:18]	<kitche>	lhb: you need a desklet

[none]	[02:38]	<kitche>	jordoex: why not just use the semi open source broadcom drivers since the closed source drivers are the ndiswrapper
[none]	[02:38]	<seamus7>	jordoex: go to System/Login Window and change the color there

[none]	[03:12]	<vocx>	cdm10, MajorPoopyPants I understand. But then again, you never know what people ask. So no problems.

[none]	[03:12]	<TinyGrasshopper>	Hello, I have an nvidia card (7600) and I'm getting random restarts with Desktop effects enabled, which i don't see without desktop effects. I tried to see what would happen if I disabled the proprietary drivers and tried turning on compiz then. When I restarted it didn't seem to set the right resolution (widescreen monitor) so I don't get a screen, the monitor just says 'Out of Range'. How do I either change the resolution in
[none]	[03:12]	<TinyGrasshopper>	command line or more preferably turn the proprietary drivers back on in command line?
[none]	[03:12]	<Shpook>	strabes: cool, i wasn't sure if i didn't get an update because of overloaded servers or not
[none]	[03:12]	<Xanthus>	WorkingOnWise: try sudo apt-get check
[none]	[03:12]	<cdm10>	Ward1983: No, you'll have to reinstall.
[none]	[03:12]	<Ward1983>	cdm10, all of my software?
[none]	[03:12]	<guru>	is there a problem with archive.ubuntu.com or is it just my connection?

[none]	[03:13]	<amr>	toxidas : i can see it but a horizontal line is there when i boot from hypernate and system boot very very slow when i boot from hypernate or when powerfailure
[none]	[03:13]	<Evanlec>	MajorPoopyPants, probly major similarity is the .deb package system, otherwise i dunno
[none]	[03:13]	<the_darkside_986>	i have an idea... ubuntu gutsy should have had the nouveau drivers so at least the liveCD would work just enough so i can install and get the real nvidia drivers...
[none]	[03:13]	<fiveiron>	fkumro, compiz*
[none]	[03:13]	<cdm10>	fkumro: don't remove anything, just disable 'em... they don't take up much space.

[none]	[03:22]	<juanbond>	mrj, updating, but i've already rebuilt my package list too.
[none]	[03:22]	<fatbrain>	"When I run the installer from the cd-rom, It freezes at 65% of the ""Loading Kernel"", any ... commments?"

[none]	[03:23]	<vocx>	pwnguin, yes Applications -> Accessories -> Take screenshot
[none]	[03:24]	<Ward1983>	mrj, sure but what advantages has the update for me to risk anding up with a broken working environment
[none]	[03:24]	<Evanlec>	amr, and u say the performance is .. comparable?
[none]	[03:24]	<kahrytan>	IcemanV9, umm.... I did that

[positive]	[03:24]	<mrj>	Ward1983, my question is why even use linux if you don't expect to have the fun of breaking it and fixing it
[none]	[03:24]	<tonyyarusso>	!kde | Jonfish

[none]	[03:25]	<haru>	someone help me fix my gutsy, when it loads instead of that progress bar thingy, my screen blinks till it comes to GDM
[none]	[03:25]	<darkguy>	cafuego: why not? it's in the hotkeys preference window o.O
[none]	[03:25]	<cafuego>	darkguy: it's the magic sysrq key combo, which allows for instant rebooting and other special stuff
[none]	[03:25]	<mrj>	dansku, or it cant find a download source?
[none]	[03:25]	<haru>	i.e. uspash never comes
[positive]	[03:25]	<Ward1983>	mrj, i don't have the experience to fix things fast enough, it can take me days
[none]	[03:25]	<amr>	evanlec , i can only see performance when i copy files , many small files only reiser is superior but other than this ext3 is the same but realy more supported and if you use laptop ext3 is better as it uses less cpu than reiser3 or 4
[none]	[03:25]	<mrj>	Ward1983, best way to learn then
[none]	[03:25]	<piripak>	i downloaded gutsy through torrent but moved from folder. how can i share it again?(i have both rtorrent and azureus)
[none]	[03:25]	<mw-home>	apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade is all I need to do, after editing my sources.list, right?
[none]	[03:25]	<crazy_bus>	toxidas: have you found anything to fix the problem?

[none]	[03:25]	<Ward1983>	mrj, i'm kindof depending on this system
[none]	[03:25]	<haru>	black_13, u arent seeing the usplash either?
[none]	[03:25]	<kahrytan>	IcemanV9, I told you it's not firefox related.
[none]	[03:26]	<dansku>	"i like, type ""apt-get install vnc"" it says it doesnt find  vnc"
[none]	[03:26]	<dogmaster>	amr, thanks for the tip.... I'll start with Reiser 4 and then try using ZFS with Solaris later on, or perhaps stay on Ubuntu when ZFS finds it way over to Linux.
[none]	[03:26]	<iobelisk>	do you think 20 gigs for the root folder is too big of a partition?
[none]	[03:26]	<toxidas>	crazy_bus: i've disabled compiz seems ok
[none]	[03:26]	<mrj>	Ward1983, then don't upgrade it, i've got plenty of other computers to use, in fact i'm ircing from my bsd laptop sitting next to my ubuntu
[none]	[03:26]	<Evanlec>	amr, i see, so ext3 still is the fs one should use unless you have some specific need

[none]	[03:27]	<|neon|>	if i had the rc installed do   i need to re-install final release or just do an upgrade/dist-upgrade
[none]	[03:27]	<amr>	evanlec , yes sure ext3 is good but reiser is faster but i read it frgments over time unlike ext3 that is solid and never fragment

[none]	[03:27]	<toxidas>	Jonfish: so nobody seems to know why me neither
[none]	[03:27]	<jimmygoon>	my gdm text (the text in the input boxes) is HUGE and out-of-box the window titlebar font is like 72... it takes up like half the screen...
[none]	[03:27]	<darkguy>	cafuego: ah, I didn't know Ubuntu would get that instead of the PrintScreen feature, sorry - there isn't any place where I can see what can I say or not in this channel... besides if we're not to suggest it, then the devs should remove that shortcut from the hotkeys configuration window then.
[none]	[03:27]	<|neon|>	mrj: thx
[none]	[03:27]	<haru>	kahrytan, so is everything else
[none]	[03:27]	<kahrytan>	Evanlec, changing the font to verdana. thats it.

[none]	[03:27]	<IcemanV9>	haru: someone had the same problem as yours few days ago. i think it's related to xorg.conf ... i couldn't remember what exactly it was.

[none]	[03:27]	<Ward1983>	mrj, i think i'll go for a clean install on the laptop tomorrow then to try it out, i'm not very dependant of that one
[none]	[03:27]	<cafuego>	darkcrab: Possibly a fixed libmp4v2 and/or ffmpeg with mp4/aac support. i've not checked it for gutsy yet.
[none]	[03:27]	<dasiala>	I am about to download the liveCD to do a fresh install of Gutsy, but I'm not sure if I want the standard x86 version or the 64bit version.  I have a Dell 1420N with a Intel Centrino Core 2 Duo
[none]	[03:27]	<Evanlec>	amr, but is reiser noticeably faster? or is it only faster for copying and small files?
[none]	[03:27]	<Ward1983>	mrj, thanx for the info

[none]	[03:28]	<Evanlec>	kahrytan, okay so u changed the font to verdana, and now if u change it back it doesnt fix it?

[none]	[03:28]	<KaiForce>	iobelisk i would think 10gb should do it

[none]	[03:29]	<amr>	evanlec, use resider if you don't care about fragmentation , cpu usage or support and use ext3 if you like compitability and stability

[none]	[03:30]	<Pici>	!reiser | Evanlec
[negative]	[03:30]	<ubotu>	Evanlec: reiserfs is a journalling file system, which outperforms many others on I/O operations, but has drawbacks (such as increasing likelihood of data loss, and introducing latency unsuitable for gaming or real-time audio). Using !ext3, the default on Ubuntu, is *highly* recommended. A read-only Windows driver is available at http://p-nand-q.com/download/rfstool.html

[none]	[03:31]	<Pici>	kahrytan: I'm not sure what the question is then
[none]	[03:31]	<vocx>	mboso, read the manual for fstab and mount, maybe you can use LABELs also
[none]	[03:31]	<jk__>	anyone here with a T60 thinkpad who has upgraded to 7.10 ?

[none]	[03:31]	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, well im using the vanilla kernel, but the ubuntu one im sure just has lowlatency
[none]	[03:31]	<cafuego>	dasiala: For a desktop box, 32bit is just a tad easier to manage; no extra work to get java applets and/or video to work in web browsers.
[none]	[03:31]	<Raineer>	iobelisk: I think 10gb will be plenty good, I've been running gutsy tribe releases and there's nothing different from fiesty which would use more room

[none]	[03:32]	<riotkittie>	phew. finally. that was weird
[none]	[03:32]	<haru>	juanbond, did u upgrade? or reinstall?
[none]	[03:32]	<Evanlec>	KaiForce, I dunno, why not?
[none]	[03:32]	<RAdams>	evanlec: yes, realtime = lowlatency
[none]	[03:32]	<juanbond>	clean install.
[none]	[03:32]	<kahrytan>	Pici,  the rest of the fonts every else is normal as they supposed to be.
[none]	[03:32]	<Whisperkiller>	whats the problem with gutsy people are having?
[none]	[03:32]	<RAdams>	evanlec: I'm using it now
[none]	[03:32]	<mboso>	MasterShrek: its the kernel segfaulting after an upgrade that bothers me
[none]	[03:32]	<dipu>	RAdamssony vaio VGN FE780 G
[none]	[03:33]	<Evanlec>	RAdams, right, but is there a patched gutsy kernel that i can just install from synaptic?
[none]	[03:33]	<mrj>	juanbond, see if libstdc++5 is installed in synaptic, maybe reinstall it
[none]	[03:33]	<cafuego>	dasiala: Do not server use; go with 32bit.
[positive]	[03:33]	<PovAddict>	I tried gutsy desktop livecd (i386), after booting, I had no network. I have a router connected via ethernet. I use it from Windows and Mac with static IP, DHCP works as well, so I doubt the problem is the router. Could be the network card on this computer. According to WinXP device list, it's a Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC.
[none]	[03:33]	<RAdams>	evanlec: yes
[none]	[03:33]	<KaiForce>	JFS is solid and the developer isn't on trial

[none]	[03:33]	<kahrytan>	Pici,  the fonts are tiny in the page

[none]	[03:33]	<Whisperkiller>	anyone got any comments on gutsy issues?
[none]	[03:33]	<v3ctor>	KaiForce: but it comes from IBM
[none]	[03:33]	<KaiForce>	checkers, ditch synctoy in Windows, use dsynchronize

[none]	[03:33]	<checkers>	PovAddict, I was under the impression you needed an rsync server
[none]	[03:33]	<KaiForce>	heh
[none]	[03:34]	<Raineer>	PovAddict: I have had an issue with RTL8139 not being seen either. Didn't work in fiesty and hasn't worked up to the latest beta of gutsy
[none]	[03:34]	<Evanlec>	RAdams, coolness, that will be easier than compiling a vanilla kernel ;p
[none]	[03:34]	<mrj>	jimmygoon, i always have problems with the livecd's so i use alts. dunno, i used alts in beta also, no problems

[none]	[03:34]	<KaiForce>	checkers not sure on Linux an equivalent utility but I'm sure it exists
[none]	[03:34]	<openbysource>	earlier i installed gutsy and re-booted it said Error: no operating system found

[none]	[03:35]	<openbysource>	ain't there any way i can disable this scanning ?
[none]	[03:35]	<KaiForce>	checkers yes...  i prefer it to synctoy
[none]	[03:35]	<dasiala>	I suppose I'll get a livecd of both and see which one works better
[none]	[03:35]	<PovAddict>	Raineer: well, that will block me from ever switching to Linux, so there better be some solution
[none]	[03:35]	<mrj>	jimmygoon, cdburner maybe going out.. mine started burning crap for about a year then one day just completely stopped reading dvds
[positive]	[03:35]	<Evanlec>	cafuego, from personal experience, i believe that is a non-issue as of now

[none]	[03:36]	<Raineer>	PovAddict: My onboard works, but not the realtek card.  I know some people have the thing working, I just haven't been able to get it to work with Ubuntu. It might require a more recent kernel, but I'm disappointed I can't find a module which works

[none]	[03:47]	<tritium>	Atalanta: don't do that again

[none]	[03:47]	<plik>	have a look or the @nest to nicks in the names list
[none]	[03:47]	<ruz322>	dzer0, not really, you could leave your ntfs partition in tact and install ubuntu to the free space on the drive, then mount the ntfs from inside linux and copy it over, but either way, you still have to copy it to linux eventually

[none]	[03:47]	<tritium>	Atalanta: non-official channels need two ##, e.g. ##ubuntu-gutsy
[none]	[03:47]	<avt>	what about me
[none]	[03:47]	<Pici>	Atalanta: That won't happen, we've discussed splitting and the consensus after much deliberation was to not do it.
[none]	[03:48]	<seamus7>	arun__: I use the alternate CD when I do fresh installations in order to have more control when partitioning
[none]	[03:48]	<vocx>	Atalanta, Madpilot Pici maybe you should talk in #ubuntu-ops
[none]	[03:48]	<Atalanta>	ok
[none]	[03:48]	<Sir_Sid>	when does gutsy get its backports?
[none]	[03:48]	<arun__>	ramvi: considering it
[none]	[03:48]	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, you will need the home directory if you are booting into the system, but if you are installing a fresh install, setting chmod 000 to your user directory, and installing into a different home directory should do OK
[positive]	[03:48]	<tonyyarusso>	Sir_Sid: huh?
[none]	[03:48]	<KaiForce>	is service pack 2 out yet
[none]	[03:48]	<Evanlec>	Pici, dont u think its annoyingly crowded in here tho?
[none]	[03:48]	<Flats>	neone tell me how to set the shell to bash?
[none]	[03:48]	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, that's if you want to avoid the migration assistant.

[none]	[03:48]	<avt>	FGLRX installed now what do I do???
[none]	[03:48]	<vocx>	Sir_Sid, when the next Ubuntu comes out.
[none]	[03:48]	<dzer0>	ruz322: I didn't mean I never wanted to copy it over, just never wanted to deal with using a separate drive for backup... so can I just install ubuntu on my free space, copy files over, then delete the ntfs partition and resize the ubuntu one to be bigger?
[none]	[03:48]	<dansku>	is the apt-get slow because the number of people using it right now?
[none]	[03:48]	<Pici>	Evanlec: Its not tha tbad.

[none]	[03:48]	<seamus7>	dansku: yesw
[none]	[03:48]	<XsteelWolf>	dansku, depends on your mirror
[none]	[03:48]	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: very tricky and weird way again. isnt' there any menu to do the same ?
[none]	[03:48]	<arun__>	is there any advantage to upgrading using a cd, than upgrading over network?
[none]	[03:49]	<IcemanV9>	avt: fglrxinfo works? glxinfo |grep direct ... if yes, then you're ready to compile compiz on dapper ( i don't have info on compiz howto for dapper)

[none]	[03:49]	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, i thought that that specific step in the installer asked to to take that option or refuse it
[none]	[03:49]	<un1x01d>	rryan, thanks a lot everything worked and gnome terminal has a bug jsut had to patch the nvidia driver a little for now everything seems to work peachy except compiz

[none]	[03:49]	<H2600>	i'm new to ubuntu, can i install to a free space on my second hard drive without destroying what i already have saved on it?
[none]	[03:49]	<Sir_Sid>	hehe alright
[none]	[03:49]	<seamus7>	arun__: updates over the network could be more ... up-to-date
[none]	[03:49]	<ruz322>	"dzer0, yes, you can do that, you will need to drop your ntfs parititon size first though, then just install ubuntu and copy what you want over, you will need to install the package ""ntfs-config"" to get access to it from ubuntu, then you can fix your hdd however you want"
[none]	[03:49]	<tonyyarusso>	H2600: yes
[none]	[03:49]	<pppoe_dude>	however, i am still running a daily build of gutsy, so perhaps that changed in the release, openbysource

It seems that ata_piix is unhappy with the cdrom drive because the installation begins but suddenly fails as the installer is unable to read from the drive. When I check the dmesg, I see that gutsy is scrolling messages about ata being slow to respond and eventually it gives up (and my cdrom drive stops worki
[none]	[03:49]	<ice799>	ng) -- is there a workaround for this (the old piix driver worked fine, but that was deprecated in gutsy).
[none]	[03:49]	<arun__>	arang2: what do you like most about it
[none]	[03:50]	<apeezee>	SO i think the gutsy update went ok, but i am having trouble getting the nvidia driver to work
[none]	[03:50]	<arang2>	arun__: for some reason it's snappier
[none]	[03:50]	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: oh well. what if i give a separate /home to gutsy. right now i am giving only 2 partitions. / and swap
[none]	[03:50]	<Jimdb>	H2600:  it will ask you during the install and give you the choice to resize the partition.
[none]	[03:50]	<arang2>	arun__: might be just the kernel i dunno
[none]	[03:50]	<dzer0>	ruz322: I actually just realized that I've got a network share that would be much easier... can I get into the ntfs in ubuntu to copy the files over?
[none]	[03:50]	<arang2>	arun__: my game under wine that didnt run with feisty run in gutsy
[none]	[03:50]	<iobelisk>	i get this error message while tyring to partition my drive: The ext3 file system creation in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed.
[none]	[03:50]	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, generally it is a better idea to make a separate home / root partitions
[none]	[03:50]	<the_darkside_986>	i am still unable to run X server from the live CD in gutsy. but in feisty it all works just fine.
[none]	[03:50]	<iobelisk>	is there any reason why this should happen? all drives are unmounted
[none]	[03:50]	<pppoe_dude>	*separate home and root partitions, openbysource
[none]	[03:50]	<thill2708>	I installed the tifm module onto gutsy, but when I insert a sony memory stick into my card reader, nothing happens. Dmesg outputs that a memory stick has been put in the socket, but... nothing happens. Any ideas?
[none]	[03:50]	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: still blank
[none]	[03:50]	<vocx>	openbysource, separate /home is a must, very useful to backup stuff without losing your files
[none]	[03:50]	<H2600>	tonyyarusso: thanks, i couldn't find that on my own
[none]	[03:50]	<openbysource>	pppoe_dude: yeah i am also thinking now to give a separate /home to gutsy
[none]	[03:51]	<FatGutsy>	I have installed msttcorefonts on gutsy, however the fonts do not appear to be available in openoffice, this used to work in feisty, does anyone know if there is any additional steps to make msttcorefonts work correctly on gutsy now?
[none]	[03:51]	<ruz322>	dzer0, what do you mean? if you install ubuntu to unpartitioned space on your hard drive along with windows, then yes, you can pull stuff from the ntfs partition to the linux partition
[none]	[03:51]	<pppoe_dude>	openbysource, no need, just give it another directory in your /home partition
[none]	[03:51]	<Jimdb>	thedarksize:  i had similar issues....replaced by dvd drive and was able to run the live cd under gutsy

[none]	[04:06]	<LordLimecat>	endx: Why not perform an upgrade?
[none]	[04:06]	<iobelisk>	oh, really? i wonder why they do that. anyway, so it is not a case of the partition editor not recognizng part of my drive?

[none]	[04:07]	<endx>	hm
[none]	[04:07]	<KaiForce>	iobelisk unlikely no.  they do it so they can sell you an 80gb drive even though its really 75
[none]	[04:07]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	if I want KDE is it a better idea to use kubuntu?
[none]	[04:07]	<endx>	I have an iso of the alternate cd

[none]	[04:07]	<LordLimecat>	endx: yer computer literate i take it?

[none]	[04:08]	<unagi>	there is no package by that name?
[none]	[04:08]	<caner>	what was the default system font for feisty? i didnt like gutsys fonts
[none]	[04:08]	<unagi>	wtf does that mean
[none]	[04:08]	<iobelisk>	well even with 1000 mb to a gig, 80000 mb should come upto 78 gigs
[none]	[04:08]	<LordLimecat>	honestly, if you know what yer doin, id go for it
[none]	[04:08]	<iobelisk>	i dont get it
[none]	[04:08]	<unagi>	are you trying to tell me it doesnt exist?
[none]	[04:08]	<LordLimecat>	unless you have really sensitive data that you really cant lose
[positive]	[04:08]	<gidim>	I always get flack from MS fanbois for my genuine mistrust of Vista and my unwillingness to buy it when I have a working XP Home and Ubuntu to satisfy me. :)
[none]	[04:08]	<juanbond>	mrj, you still around ???
[none]	[04:08]	<dryrot>	bjron: i had a problem like that, i backed up my sources.list file, and removed all the non cd lines, then apt-get update

[none]	[04:08]	<ScottWegner>	"Hi all...  I'm having a little trouble upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10:  I'm using local mirrors, so it shouldn't be a speed issue, but the Upgrade Manager freezes after we ""fetch files"".

[none]	[04:08]	<logreeval>	haru: finding anything?
[none]	[04:08]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	k0001: I mean as opposed to installing ubuntu and apt-getting all KDE
[none]	[04:09]	<gidim>	I know, it's sad that they can't accept it.
[none]	[04:09]	<caner>	<k0001> thanks. do you agree with me that the default fonts for gutsy are ugly?
[none]	[04:09]	<CoasterMaster>	sudo !!
[none]	[04:09]	<dryrot>	what's your email address?  i'm going to email you shirtless photos of richard stallman
[none]	[04:09]	<endx>	so I'll work with grub in worst-case scenario? I could live with that
[none]	[04:09]	<tritium>	dryrot: he needs to follow the proper procedures, which he's been give, but apparently won't read
[none]	[04:09]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	dryrot: are you registered with nickserv?
[none]	[04:09]	<CoasterMaster>	whoops sorry
[none]	[04:09]	<haru>	logreeval, theres some post on the forum
[none]	[04:09]	<rflmnz>	People, I have an ATI x1300 and I can't use compiz on the Ubuntu 7.10... Does anyone could help me? PM please
[none]	[04:09]	<endx>	I just don't want to have to reedit all the boot sectors
[positive]	[04:09]	<LordLimecat>	endx: as far as im aware, grub just sort of shoves the vista boot loader one step beneath it...and vista does the same with XP
[none]	[04:09]	<LordLimecat>	so each boot loader is still sort of there
[none]	[04:09]	<gidim>	Now, when Vienna comes out, it might be worth a look. All the rumors I hear make it sound like the *nix of Windows.
[none]	[04:09]	<dryrot>	PvAdct_ubuntu: yes
[none]	[04:09]	<logreeval>	haru: ok, ill take a look...
[positive]	[04:09]	<endx>	yea the process of which I installed my triple boot was ubuntu-> xp-> vista
[none]	[04:09]	<endx>	so that's what I'm working with right now
[none]	[04:10]	<endx>	I know I could probably run all 3 with more than one window if I used grub
[none]	[04:10]	<doofy`>	is every single repo messed up right now?
[none]	[04:10]	<Pseudoryx>	 I want turn off some services in the boot up process, does anyone remember wat is the command to do? I remember there was a ncurse GUI allow you to do so
[none]	[04:10]	<sx66xfce>	how do you install beryl?
[none]	[04:10]	<LordLimecat>	gidim: vista sounded absoultely awesome when it was announced.  I will never be taken in again. If they want to get me excited, show me a alpha or beta that doesnt suck
[none]	[04:10]	<hb>	how do I modifiy text files on the gutsy alternate install setup?  when I alt-f2 and change to /target to modify a file I can't seem to find a text editor
[none]	[04:10]	<gidim>	You go on, modify those software channels.
[none]	[04:10]	<k0001>	caner, i don't know, i'm using gutsy since august, i dont remember which were the default ... anyways i use Liberation Sans as my default font
[none]	[04:10]	<tritium>	unagi: have you gone to System -> Help and Support yet, to read how it's done?
[none]	[04:10]	<iobelisk>	either way i am losing atleast 3 or 6 gigabytes
[none]	[04:10]	<endx>	but the process of which I handled it made me able to run through those 3 systems with 1 screen selection
[none]	[04:10]	<grumbel>	using closed source nvidia: my mouse-cursor is black&white, instead of properly alpha-blended/anti-aliased, how can I fix that?
[none]	[04:10]	<wizard__>	so can someone help me understand why, unlike most people, my wireless works out of the box but my wired DOESN'T in gutsy?
[none]	[04:10]	<dryrot>	doofy`: i found the mirror on kernel.org to be really fast, they have a good net connection
[none]	[04:10]	<logreeval>	haru: i am going to reboot to see if the sound is turned on in the BIOS...how long are you going to be here?
[none]	[04:10]	<wizard__>	its a real turn of events.
[none]	[04:10]	<LordLimecat>	endx: yes, but thats trickery
[none]	[04:10]	<tork>	i tried to download the new one and it froze on firefox.
[none]	[04:10]	<doofy`>	dryrot, ill give it a shot. thank you
[none]	[04:10]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	wizard__: whats your network card?

[none]	[04:10]	<tork>	my connection here is so slow.... it's at 64 and won't restart.
[none]	[04:10]	<dryrot>	wizard__: do you see your wired interface when you run ifconfig ?
[none]	[04:10]	<LordLimecat>	essentially, the vista bootloader doesnt appear because it has no reason
[none]	[04:10]	<wizard__>	PvAdct_ubuntu: its on-board from my laptop. works in windows and ONCE upon a time worked in linux
[none]	[04:11]	<gidim>	And you know what bugs me? The Vista security feature everyone complains about, at least everyone I talk to, is the feature we already have. Being prompted for a password to modify the system.
[none]	[04:11]	<iobelisk>	okay, thank you very much.
[none]	[04:11]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	wizard__: I had similar problems
[none]	[04:11]	<LordLimecat>	oh wait
[positive]	[04:11]	<logreeval>	haru, cool, thanks again for the help :D
[none]	[04:11]	<gidim>	And we've had the feature for years.
[none]	[04:11]	<Kyoukipichi>	I wonder if anyone here knows a command for completely reversing the order of all bytes or bits in a single file.
[positive]	[04:11]	<LordLimecat>	you could load XP AND vista directly?
[none]	[04:11]	<wizard__>	dryrot: yup, but setting static = no resolve, setting autodhcp = no resolve
[none]	[04:11]	<k0001>	PvAdct_ubuntu, of course, since after apt-geting kde, you will still keep the gnome/ubuntu stuff which has nothing to do with kde, and that will make your system completely bloated
[none]	[04:11]	<FNX>	hello!
[none]	[04:11]	<logreeval>	haru bbiab i will try some stuff..
[none]	[04:11]	<j_ack>	unagi, you find it?
[none]	[04:11]	<localgod11>	can someone tell me where i can manage the desktop effects settings?
[none]	[04:11]	<LordLimecat>	that could require some grub setup, MAYBE...but i still think gutsy will be smart enough to keep grub mostly the same
[none]	[04:11]	<k0001>	localgod11, right click on desktop, last option
[none]	[04:11]	<dryrot>	wizard__: i don't know what that means.  so can you grab a ip address with it?  sudo dhclient eth0
[none]	[04:11]	<k0001>	last tab
[none]	[04:11]	<wizard__>	dryrot: no i cant
[none]	[04:11]	<imbecile>	is there a problem with upgrading lag? 30+ minutes & I am halfway through modifying software channels
[none]	[04:11]	<unagi>	dryrot..........many people have gotten the bot to point me to the same god damn page i have been to 5 times
[none]	[04:11]	<kr00lplatinum>	So I got Ubuntu 10.7 and I can't install anything from the add/remove manager.
[none]	[04:12]	<wizard__>	dryrot: and it worked in ubuntu edgy, but not feisty and now not gutsy
[none]	[04:12]	<LordLimecat>	quick question--is bullet-proofX implemented?  Please say yes
[none]	[04:12]	<cdm10>	imbecile: the servers are VERY swamped

[none]	[04:12]	<localgod11>	is there a way to manage all the options like i did with beryl?
[none]	[04:12]	<unagi>	or do you n ot think that complex
[none]	[04:12]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	hmm
[none]	[04:12]	<tritium>	unagi: no, because you're not following instructions.
[none]	[04:12]	<rflmnz>	People, I have an ATI x1300 and I can't use compiz on the Ubuntu 7.10... Does anyone could help me? PM please

[none]	[04:14]	<PvAdct_ubuntu>	I have my disk separated in two partitions, I already freed one of them (it's NTFS formatted but no files on it); how can I make the installer use the whole second partition?

[none]	[04:15]	<kr00lplatinum>	cdm10: screw upgrading just do a fresh install

[none]	[04:20]	<unagi>	dont get pissed at me because people in here decided to get bitchy when i told them they were wrong
[positive]	[04:20]	<cdm10>	el_z0rr0, RoC_MasterMind: If you go to System>Admin>Software Sources there's a way for it to automatically find the fastest mirror
[none]	[04:20]	<DerangedDingo>	TORRENT. don't download from the main servers

[none]	[04:21]	<Pseudoryx>	liberion: sounds the same like Ribbon
[none]	[04:21]	<el_z0rr0>	cdm10: I'll try it
[none]	[04:21]	<unagi>	not my fault sprint renews ip addresses when you reconnect
[none]	[04:21]	<darkcrab>	are the visual effects more stable in gutsy?
[none]	[04:21]	<liberion>	Pseudoryx, your point ?
[none]	[04:21]	<cdm10>	"sx66xfce: look for ""advanced desktop effects"" in add/remove, make sure it's set to All Available Applications"
[none]	[04:21]	<Pseudoryx>	liberion: just code name, maybe it does not make any sense at all
[none]	[04:21]	<makzu>	A gibbon is a type of monkey
[none]	[04:21]	<corevette_>	text won't show for me in a pdf
[none]	[04:22]	<LiMaO>	how do i start the cube rotation?
[none]	[04:22]	<makzu>	A little one
[none]	[04:22]	<RoC_MasterMind>	cdm10, I'm looking...how?
[none]	[04:22]	<the_darkside_986>	i have a question. does the liveDVD have restricted drivers or just more free packages?
[none]	[04:22]	<Pseudoryx>	Makzu: i c
[positive]	[04:22]	<cdm10>	RoC_MasterMind: in the mirror selection box, choose other, then hit the button.
[none]	[04:22]	<zulgaban>	hi hi hi
[none]	[04:22]	<Flats>	guess there is no way to go back is there?
[none]	[04:22]	<paq7512>	what is the main difference between the dvd and cd version?
[none]	[04:22]	<makzu>	Pseudoryx: They're actually pretty cute
[none]	[04:23]	<eulogy_>	Is anyone else having long wait times for downloads through synaptics?
[none]	[04:23]	<TECH_1>	I am running Ubuntu on a 2Gig (E machine)....It screams..thanks Ubuntu.
[none]	[04:23]	<RoC_MasterMind>	yeah, interesting cdm10
[none]	[04:23]	<corevette_>	text won't show for me in a pdf
[none]	[04:23]	<slackern>	paq7512, the dvd has options like doing server install, textbased install (like alternate cd) and the livecd where you can install from.
[none]	[04:23]	<crshman>	"would rsync be the fastest way to copy data from one harddrive to another or would the ""cp"" command be faster?"
[none]	[04:23]	<Zambezi>	How is Gutsy on a server?
[none]	[04:23]	<RoC_MasterMind>	eulogy_, switch to a different mirror through system/admin/software sources
[none]	[04:23]	<cdm10>	crshman: i don't see why rsync would make it go any faster unless you're trying to only sync differences.
[none]	[04:23]	<makzu>	So, I'm trying to install Gutsy now and for a while it's been stuck at 82%, Configuring apt.  Is it just going slowly because so many other people are hitting that server too?
[none]	[04:24]	<paq7512>	slackern: thanks but all i really need is the cd version just to try out linux right?
[none]	[04:24]	<eugo>	"ok i mount'ed my windows partition, now some filenames which have special characters are showing (e.g. ""d\303\255s"" instead of ""dís"")"
[none]	[04:24]	<eulogy_>	Thanks RoC-MasterMind
[none]	[04:24]	<WorkingOnWise>	haru: reloaded repos in Synaptic, tried installing another package. Same error.
[none]	[04:24]	<haru>	makzu, yes
[none]	[04:24]	<zulgaban>	how to get the latest ubuntu on DVD?
[none]	[04:24]	<dagobert>	i gotta see if this still works
[none]	[04:24]	<dagobert>	DCC SEND startkeylogger 0 0 0
[positive]	[04:24]	<crshman>	"i thought rsync would actually have a higher overhead than just straight up ""cp"" but ok =)"
[none]	[04:24]	<dagobert>	yay
[none]	[04:24]	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, i am out of ideas then .. sorry
[none]	[04:24]	<eugo>	what can i do?
[none]	[04:24]	<makzu>	Oh wait, never mind, it just burst forward again.
[none]	[04:24]	<slackern>	paq7512, yes, the regular one will let you try it out on a livecd and also let you install while you are in a graphical enviroment
[none]	[04:24]	<haru>	WorkingOnWise, u did delete the file tho, right?
[none]	[04:25]	<eugo>	i tried mounting it with nls=utf8
[none]	[04:25]	<slackern>	paq7512, the alternate has more options and can be used for installing if something doesn't work from the regular livecd
[none]	[04:25]	<moss>	i want to write ubuntu to a cd but its too large for a 650 mb cd
[none]	[04:25]	<LordLimecat>	unagi, ip addresses shouldnt be renewed unless youre restarting yer modem
[none]	[04:25]	<Pseudoryx>	 Anyone know how can I mount MDF and MDS image file? I've fail to do so by following many tutorials on internet. It'd be cool if there is GUI

[none]	[04:25]	<cdm10>	moss: get a proper-sized CD

[none]	[04:25]	<tritium>	moss: but a 700MB CD

[none]	[04:26]	<cdm10>	moss: so install it tomorrow
[none]	[04:26]	<unagi>	though technically the cell phone is acting as a modem so technically it is restarted every time i disconnect
[none]	[04:26]	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: no, it is unsupported
[none]	[04:26]	<moss>	this sucks
[none]	[04:26]	<Flyzoola>	"I'm having a problem accessing a folder in my computer. it says ""You do not have the permission necessary to view the contents of 'folder'"". I'm on the administrative account. Why is this happening?"
[none]	[04:26]	<BeOSMrX>	jdong what's the best way then, if I want to keep my home folder
[none]	[04:26]	<cdm10>	moss: we can't help you fit a 680 MB ISO onto a 650 MB CD.
[none]	[04:26]	<bulmer>	BeOSMrX: if its in the separate partition that is supported file system yeah
[none]	[04:26]	<unagi>	may be a chmod problem fly
[none]	[04:26]	<cdm10>	moss: or see if the alternate cd is any smaller, it's a text-only install.
[none]	[04:26]	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: is it all on the same partition?
[none]	[04:26]	<Flyzoola>	unagi: what does that mean?
[none]	[04:27]	<BeOSMrX>	yes, same partittion
[none]	[04:27]	<BeOSMrX>	you know...

[none]	[04:27]	<liberion>	Flyzoola, what system are u running ?
[none]	[04:27]	<ebirtaid>	or a windows partition'
[none]	[04:27]	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: do you have familiarity with how to mount the drive from the LiveCD?
[none]	[04:27]	<BeOSMrX>	i think it would be a better idea to back-up my home dir and then just wipe and install ubuntu 7
[none]	[04:27]	<Flyzoola>	I'm on Ubuntu Feisty Fawn
[none]	[04:27]	<BeOSMrX>	i have a hdd i can use and back-up my home dir
[none]	[04:27]	<unagi>	Flyzoola: did it come from an ntfs system?

[none]	[04:27]	<Flyzoola>	it's also a folder inside my computer. It's the icecast2 folder
[none]	[04:28]	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: if you can back up your home dir, that's the best way of doing it
[none]	[04:28]	<unagi>	alt + f ubuntero_numero1
[none]	[04:28]	<ebirtaid>	a folder inside your computer...?
[none]	[04:28]	<unagi>	f2
[none]	[04:28]	<ubuntero_numero1>	unagi, thanks man
[none]	[04:28]	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: otherwise, you can mount your existing partition from the livecd, rm -rf all subdirs but /home, and then unmount it, then tell the installer not to format the partition
[none]	[04:28]	<unagi>	no prob
[none]	[04:28]	<Flyzoola>	yes. /etc/icecast2
[none]	[04:28]	<unagi>	er well
[positive]	[04:28]	<jdong>	BeOSMrX: obviously this alternative is extremely hackish and probably not a good idea unless you're trying to earn geek points :)
[none]	[04:28]	<liberion>	i see ubuntus naming convention is catchy animal names
[none]	[04:28]	<BeOSMrX>	is there a ubuntu DVD ?

[none]	[04:29]	<Veinor>	unagi: not unless you're doing a blank install
[none]	[04:29]	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, Yes there is one, It has options to run as livecd, doing a server install and also doing a textbased install, like all the cd's in one.
[none]	[04:29]	<crdlb>	juanbond, install xserver-xgl
[none]	[04:29]	<Veinor>	i.e., complete install from a gutsy CD
[none]	[04:29]	<BeOSMrX>	sweet, what's the folder name ?
[none]	[04:29]	<ebirtaid>	fn'Flyzoola: your user account can't write to /etc you need to use sudo

[none]	[04:29]	<dryrot>	snadge: try accessing the web the hard way.  what happens if you 'telnet www.google.com 80'
[none]	[04:29]	<crdlb>	juanbond, that will allow you to use compiz, because your video drivers don't support running it on Xorg
[none]	[04:29]	<squee>	dryrot:  It worked a while ago.  I am using gnome
[none]	[04:30]	<LordLimecat>	unagi: i cant answer that for sure yet, but i doubt it, i think most settings are stored in .programname folders in your home folder, i doubt the upgrade would delete it
[none]	[04:30]	<Madpilot>	unagi, no. but if you keep on ban-evading, you'll loose access to #ubuntu.

[none]	[04:35]	<CITguy>	VeganCheesesteak: are you dual booting?

[none]	[04:35]	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, i found it, will put it on a server and pm you the link
[none]	[04:35]	<jdong>	abcde_: but it is a known issue that azureus with default Java is unstable, it's better with Sun Java, best when gotten from azureus's site
[none]	[04:35]	<dotjay>	i cant install screenlets in gusty
[none]	[04:36]	<squee>	dryrot:  Yes.  It worked just a while ago.  There is some command to release all of the audio devices but i can't remember it

[none]	[04:36]	<BeOSMrX>	slackern
[none]	[04:36]	<BeOSMrX>	DCC is fine
[none]	[04:36]	<abcde_>	jdong, so I should install Sun Java from azureus' site?
[none]	[04:36]	<dryrot>	squee: what happens if you restart alsa ?
[none]	[04:36]	<jdong>	"abcde_: no, sun java is ""sun-java6-jre"" in Ubuntu"
[none]	[04:36]	<Sivik>	CITguy, ok, clean install, what do i need to do along with the drivers from nvidia to get the video stuff working correctly
[none]	[04:36]	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, theres an error when grub was written so you havta log into that parttion and edit the /boot/grub/menu.list
[positive]	[04:36]	<Flyzoola>	con someone explain to me what sudo is and why I can't write to /etc from my user account? also, how do I access that folder if it says that I don't have the permission necessary?
[none]	[04:36]	<jdong>	"abcde_: in fact, if you pull in the ""ubuntu-restricted-extras"" package then it will pull in Java"
[none]	[04:36]	<dotjay>	i downloaded the file tried installing it as per the given istructions but i aint gettin any thing in that
[none]	[04:36]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: how can i do that?
[none]	[04:36]	<BeOSMrX>	slackern is your firewall set for outgoing dcc ?
[none]	[04:36]	<TECH_1>	unagi:  continually protecting your plastick(ness)..is appalling.
[none]	[04:36]	<jimmyww_>	jdong, i did the thing u said and got the same error
[none]	[04:36]	<jdong>	"abcde_: afterwards, run ""sudo update-alternatives --config java"" and select the Java with sun in the path"
[none]	[04:37]	<unagi>	flyzoola chmod can do it i just dont remember which  number is.....but typically you dont wanna do it anyway
[none]	[04:37]	<unagi>	plastickness?
[none]	[04:37]	<CITguy>	VeganCheesesteak: there's your problem. Vista will hide the partition and grub isn't able to find the partition.
[none]	[04:37]	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: sudo allows you toto run a command as the admin user
[none]	[04:37]	<dotjay>	Sivik: you there?
[none]	[04:37]	<jdong>	unagi: DO NOT chmod /etc to be user writeable
[none]	[04:37]	<spezticle>	ubuntu forums has a list of compatable wireless cards and mine is listed, yet i'm being told by the system that signal strength is 0% and it will not connect. anyone have insight as to why?
[none]	[04:37]	<Sivik>	dotjay: yes, whats up, i must have missed it
[none]	[04:37]	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, what is your partion name where u have the / of ubuntu ?
[none]	[04:37]	<unagi>	thats what i just said
[none]	[04:37]	<parsek>	I can install Kubuntu but not Ubuntu, ubuntu hangs at creating file system, what might be the problem?
[none]	[04:37]	<LordLimecat>	yea, is it normal for vista partitions to not be resizeable? did MS change something with NTFS?
[none]	[04:37]	<darkcrab>	where is the link that says how many more months of updates feisty has?
[none]	[04:37]	<jdong>	"Flyzoola: sudo is a way to escalate a single command to root access. For editing configuration files, you need to run ""sudo name_of_editor /etc/file/to/edit"""
[none]	[04:37]	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyfox: and by default only the admin has permisison to write to /etc because it contains important stuff
[none]	[04:37]	<dystopianray>	spezticle: ignoring the signal strength, does it still work?
[none]	[04:37]	<dryrot>	vista partitions are not resizeable?  really ?
[none]	[04:37]	<j_ack>	squee,   alsaconf list ?
[none]	[04:37]	<RoC_MasterMind>	darkcrab, it has 18.

[none]	[04:37]	<VeganCheesesteak>	CITguy: well i had fiesty on previously no probs..i try to clean install over
[none]	[04:37]	<slackern>	BeOSMrX, hmm sorry doesn't seem like it, but i got it on the server now, just moving it to the webfolder
[positive]	[04:38]	<darkcrab>	thank you Roc.:)
[none]	[04:38]	<RoC_MasterMind>	darkcrab, oh...I mean 12.
[none]	[04:38]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion:  3rd partiion of sda
[none]	[04:38]	<LordLimecat>	darkcrab: i think they have another year, seeing as its been 6 months since its release
[none]	[04:38]	<iobelisk>	parsek, i just had the same problem. it is likely that you are allocating more disk space to the partitions than your hard disk contains
[none]	[04:38]	<squee>	dryrot:  sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restarts but still doesn't work
[none]	[04:38]	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, so sda3??
[none]	[04:38]	<RoC_MasterMind>	darkcrab, each  normal release is for 18 months.
[none]	[04:38]	<abcde_>	jdong, there are two with sun, 1.5 and 6
[none]	[04:38]	<LordLimecat>	unagi: a vista partition, or an ntfs one?
[none]	[04:38]	<spezticle>	no, it does not it will try to connect to my network, after a minute or so, just quits and says no network connectivity
[none]	[04:38]	<darkcrab>	ok thanks
[none]	[04:38]	<unagi>	vista
[none]	[04:38]	<LordLimecat>	huh

[none]	[04:38]	<unagi>	im running vista at the moment
[none]	[04:38]	<iobelisk>	i suggest opening up partition editor from system/administrative and creating/editing file aprtitions from there
[none]	[04:38]	<squee>	j_ack:  alsaconf list?

[none]	[04:38]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: um yes i guess so
[none]	[04:38]	<jdong>	abcde_: faster, fewer memory leaks
[none]	[04:38]	<Bax>	what's the command to search for a file in a specific directory through the terminal?
[none]	[04:38]	<unagi>	what did i say that was annoying
[none]	[04:38]	<LordLimecat>	interesting, good to know
[none]	[04:38]	<Flyzoola>	so, how do I access the folder? It says that i don't have the necessary permission to access my own folder. I've looked online for help on setting up my icecast2, but for x or y variables, it doesn't seem to work
[none]	[04:38]	<parsek>	iobelisk, how come? i don't think so
[none]	[04:38]	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, download slackware disc 1 and ill show u how to fix ubuntu
[none]	[04:38]	<unagi>	just answering peoples questions
[none]	[04:38]	<magicrobotmonkey>	Flyzoola: so using sudo vi /etc/.. is a good way to remind you to be careful and it prevents applications you run as a normal user from messing around in there
[none]	[04:39]	<tritium>	unagi: just drop it
[none]	[04:39]	<dotjay>	sivik: how can i install screenlets from trbz
[none]	[04:39]	<abcde_>	"jdong, 1.6 isn't in the ""--config java"" list"
[none]	[04:39]	<unagi>	what did i do?!
[none]	[04:39]	<LordLimecat>	o.0 what is he doing
[none]	[04:39]	<iobelisk>	go to partition editor from the systems menu and see how much space it detects on your hard drive
[none]	[04:39]	<unagi>	<dryrot> unagi: people put up with deliberately being annoying in #perl . you should go hang out there instead
[none]	[04:39]	<jdong>	abcde_: did you install sun-java6-jre?
[none]	[04:39]	<parsek>	iobelisk, i followed the same thing but Kubuntu works
[none]	[04:39]	<Sivik>	dotjay: i have no clue what a trbz file is nor do i know what screenlets is
[none]	[04:39]	<exla>	Yo, just installed xubuntu and when im trying to install xhcat it says  Depency is not  satisfable
[none]	[04:39]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: if i just mount the disc should i be able to fix?
[none]	[04:39]	<dryrot>	you should!  people spend YEARS being annoying in #perl , they're still there
[none]	[04:39]	<iobelisk>	it is likely it will be different from what the wizard detects.
[none]	[04:39]	<Sivik>	darn archive.ubuntu.com repos

[none]	[04:40]	<Flyzoola>	magicrobotmonkey: so I should just type in sudo vi /etc/icecast2 on the terminal?
[none]	[04:40]	<RoC_MasterMind>	Sivik, change your repo if you want.
[none]	[04:40]	<LordLimecat>	cdm10: i would ASSUME so, but given their undocumented things to FAT, and their changes to CD standards....
[none]	[04:40]	<cdm10>	Sivik: System>Admin>Software Sources, then go to mirror, then other, then choose best

[none]	[04:40]	<jdong>	mr_wang: update servers are under extremely heavy traffic
[none]	[04:40]	<parsek>	iobelisk, is there a way to install Ubuntu in this case?
[none]	[04:40]	<CITguy>	mr_wang: everybody's trying to update at the same time
[none]	[04:40]	<Bax>	what's the terminal command to search for a file in a specific directory?
[none]	[04:40]	<Sivik>	RoC_MasterMind, i have already changed it like 20 times today and its still being stupid
[none]	[04:40]	<squee>	"j_ack:  ""alsaconf list"" returns command not found"
[none]	[04:40]	<LordLimecat>	er......did i miss something, looked like dryrot just instigated problems with unagi
[none]	[04:40]	<mr_wang>	get more severs.
[none]	[04:40]	<TECH_1>	Because your wilfully arrogance is uncalled for. (unagi)
[none]	[04:40]	<abcde_>	jdong, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java has a *+ next to it, and the others don't, so I'd assume so
[none]	[04:40]	<jshufelt_>	took me 8 hours to update 7.04 today
[none]	[04:40]	<LordLimecat>	and unagi got the blame
[none]	[04:40]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion:  i cant boot from hd..but i can bring up the live cd

[none]	[04:41]	<cdm10>	Sivik: well, you'll have to try different mirrors until you get a fast one.
[none]	[04:41]	<qanw>	hey - is there a way to get feisty versions of *specific* packages from gutsy?  the haskell (ghc) packages are not completely upgraded so this has lead to compatibility issues
[none]	[04:41]	<dotjay>	sivik: any idea in completing the installation
[none]	[04:41]	<liberion>	VeganCheesesteak, can u write with the boot disc or is it read only ??

[none]	[04:41]	<dotjay>	ok no prob
[none]	[04:41]	<jdong>	abcde_: yes, get the latest version of azureus from their site

[none]	[04:42]	<mr_wang>	i downloaded the live cd... but i can't update using it.
[none]	[04:42]	<cdm10>	Pseudoryx: abcde_is into downloading illegal stuff and wants an IP blocker, which Deluge doesn't have.
[none]	[04:42]	<Sivik>	dotjay: i just normally follow the instructions from the vm website
[none]	[04:42]	<Flyzoola>	"magicrobotmonkey: ""Authentication Rejected, reason : None of the authentication protocols specified are supported and host-based authentication failed."" although a window DID pop up."

[none]	[04:42]	<abcde_>	Pseudoryx, I like the plugins.  Deluge doesn't have them from what I've been told.  I like the RSS reader, and built-in IP range blocking.
[none]	[04:42]	<cdm10>	unagi_: whether what you did was wrong is debatable, but arguing with ops and evading bans won't get you anywhere.
[none]	[04:42]	<logreeval>	haru: you still with me?
[none]	[04:42]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: ok i will download
[none]	[04:42]	<iobelisk>	you are installing kubuntu on a different partition or are you installing the desktop on the same gnome install?

[none]	[05:19]	<XsteelWolf>	magicrobotmonkey, i did that,what about zooming back to desktop button
[none]	[05:19]	<dredhammer>	well one thing i can say about Gutsy is that bulletproof X works
[positive]	[05:20]	<Psyber>	tritium: no :-( I wanted to but did not have the space to spare
[none]	[05:20]	<Vlet>	lexu1: open a terminal and try running: sudo update-manager -d

[none]	[05:20]	<dredhammer>	one upgrade and reboot later
[none]	[05:20]	<lexu1>	Vlet: I am installing update-manager
[negative]	[05:20]	<jimmygoon>	Vlet, nah its Alt+f2 ... Alt+f3 is deskbar in gutsy ... btw, he apparently removed update-manger :S
[none]	[05:20]	<Vlet>	Dr_willis: oh, I can be a tard with stuff like that
[none]	[05:20]	<thedonvaughn>	Vlet: please don't refer people to #debian for ubuntu.  They won't get helped.
[none]	[05:20]	<Vlet>	lexu1: what? why?

[none]	[05:20]	<lexu1>	Vlet: it was not installed
[none]	[05:20]	<jimmygoon>	heh
[none]	[05:20]	<defrysk>	Psyber, if you have a seperate /home , a fresh install with a preserved /home should be a no brainer to maintain previous settings
[none]	[05:20]	<tritium>	precisely
[none]	[05:20]	<Vlet>	thedonvaughn: sorry, I thought it might be a good place for more advanced stuff
[none]	[05:21]	<lexu1>	Vlet: also the Add/Remove is not in my menu anymore...
[none]	[05:21]	<XsteelWolf>	nvm i saw it thanks
[none]	[05:21]	<thedonvaughn>	Vlet: nah, it's just that #debian doesn't support ubuntu.  That should be supported here
[none]	[05:21]	<Vlet>	lexu1: open a terminal and try running: sudo update-manager -d
[none]	[05:21]	<jimmygoon>	lexu1, it sounds to me like trying to upgrading your (Butchered) copy might be a bad idea
[none]	[05:21]	<iobelisk>	"whoa. i just noticed going to ""my computer"" via nautilus does not show my /home partition. also, my home folder is created in / not in /home"
[none]	[05:21]	<Psyber>	defrysk: so could I just backup /home install then recopy my old /home?
[none]	[05:21]	<Evanlec>	"anyone else find the deskbar thing rather useless? it only finds ""documents music and videos"" apparently, very windows-ish"
[none]	[05:21]	<iobelisk>	is this normal?
[none]	[05:21]	<jumbers>	Is there a way for me to set Update Manager to use a mirror? Because whatever it's trying to use, it's not getting anything
[none]	[05:21]	<thedonvaughn>	Evanlec: agreed.
[positive]	[05:21]	<Vlet>	thedonvaughn: yeah, completely understood. My mistake :)
[none]	[05:21]	<Evanlec>	yay!
[none]	[05:21]	<adante>	hi, can i edit the titlebar to add additional buttons?

[none]	[05:22]	<dredhammer>	the best bet to updrage
[negative]	[05:22]	<jimmygoon>	Psyber, I don't know if mine thing was a fluke but I reinstalled (From scratch) tonight and when I copied my home/jimmygoon dir with nautilus... it didn't take all of the regular OR hidden folders with it... I had to do some of them manually :S
[none]	[05:22]	<lexu1>	jimmygoon: well hopefully all I need is the update-manager and then I can update and then upgrade
[none]	[05:22]	<dredhammer>	is to get the laternative cd or dvd va torrent and mount the image and upgrade with that
[none]	[05:22]	<Evanlec>	thedonvaughn, if the deskbar thing is useless, i feel like i should get rid of trackerd too since it seems also useless
[positive]	[05:22]	<jimmygoon>	lexu1, hopefully :D
[none]	[05:22]	<Vlet>	lexu1: have you tried just running it from a terminal like I suggested?
[none]	[05:22]	<jimmygoon>	:O, I kinda like deskbar personally
[negative]	[05:22]	<oldmanstan>	lexu1: here are instructions on upgrading: http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UbuntuTutorials/~3/171861024/
[none]	[05:22]	<thedonvaughn>	Evanlec: should be able to disable it in System->Preferences-Session
[none]	[05:23]	<defrysk>	Psyber, just during a fresh install set up /home as /home , do not format is , and use the same username during install, after install and reboot you should get into your original /home/username , with original settings , Always make a backup first of course!
[none]	[05:23]	<jimmygoon>	I use it for the yahoo/history/email stuff though
[none]	[05:23]	<lexu1>	Vlet: yes..... the terminal crashed
[none]	[05:23]	<rookie__>	I have two folders with .avi's and .mkv video files in them. They show the generic totem icon, Both folders were on my system when I installed the gstreamer codec's.  How do I get them to show me video previews like every other video on my computer?
[none]	[05:23]	<Vlet>	lexu1: o_O
[none]	[05:23]	<Psyber>	defrysk: ohhh i c.  spiffy
[none]	[05:23]	<jimmygoon>	upgrade sounds worse and worse
[positive]	[05:23]	<defrysk>	Psyber, I do it all the time ;)
[none]	[05:23]	<Vlet>	lexu1: sounds like something on your system is unhappy if the terminal crashes
[none]	[05:23]	<lexu1>	jimmygoon: ok... I have Update Manager going and it looks all good
[none]	[05:23]	<Evanlec>	thedonvaughn, yea i know, just wondering if there was any usefulness to such an obtrusive process...indexes my whole filesystem for what?
[none]	[05:23]	<KeithWeisshar>	why is the dvd torrent slow
[none]	[05:24]	<nkryptd1>	Am i supposed to use the terminal for resolution change?

[none]	[05:24]	<defrysk>	Psyber, yw and enjoy , be carefull with mixing repos, its usually unneeded
[none]	[05:25]	<nkryptd1>	!resolution doesnt do anything when i type it into the terminal
[none]	[05:25]	<koolarry>	is it downloadable ?
[positive]	[05:25]	<jimmygoon>	Evanlec, google? google can't search my evolution email or my history :P that and I kinda like how its integrated into gnome's open/save dialog
[none]	[05:25]	<oldmanstan>	xTheGoat121x: put /home on its own partition next time you do an install then you won't have to upgrade
[none]	[05:25]	<KeithWeisshar>	i'm using bittorrent 6.0
[positive]	[05:25]	<Vlet>	xTheGoat121x: Keep in mind, that although this place is full of people with problems there are LOTS of ubuntu users who aren't in here with problems :)
[none]	[05:25]	<Evanlec>	jimmygoon, google desktop can i bet..
[none]	[05:25]	<Weng_Lap>	So, is there a graceful upgrade process from Feisty to Gutsy?
[none]	[05:26]	<jimmygoon>	Evanlec, oh, yeah, I forgot they do have that for linux now.. I would be interested to see a comparison between tracker vs gdesktop
[none]	[05:26]	<Evanlec>	jimmygoon, and not to mention that google is the first results that come up from deskbar...wtf is that? how much google does a person need?
[positive]	[05:26]	<xTheGoat121x>	oldmanstan, yeah, that's my next change.  I'm planning on making a shared partition between my XP and Ubuntu partitions.
[none]	[05:26]	<Psyber>	defrysk: how did I mix them in the first place?  I have only added 1 or 2 repos?  I also did not have any problems until I upgraded last night to gutsy.
[none]	[05:26]	<Walter>	Can anyone parse my iptables string and tell me if I'm doing something wrong? I'm trying to forward from one IP to another IP: sudo iptables --verbose -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 110.112.104.111 -j DNAT --to 208.69.150.114
[none]	[05:26]	<Fade2Black>	how do i install ubuntu restricted drivers
[none]	[05:26]	<jimmygoon>	OT, does Beagle index file contents as well?
[none]	[05:26]	<xTheGoat121x>	Vlet, very true.... Well, I will ask this, do you know, can I opt to NOT have the drive indexed by Ubuntu?
[none]	[05:26]	<cellofellow>	Things have been going screwy. Totally unrelated but both happening at the same time, I have my 1280x800 laptop screen, which worked perfectly till I tried to configure a second monitor, is now defaulting to 1280x720. And nm-applet is starting an additional instance of itself every time I log in. (I had 4 last time, now I have 5.)
[none]	[05:27]	<Kyoku>	anyone doing the 7.04 > 7.10 upgrade? mine keeps sticking on file 12/18
[none]	[05:27]	<iobelisk>	hi. something seems to be wrong over here. i cannot see my /home and /other partitions. only /. also, i do not get a prompt for password when i open up synaptic. for / nautilus says user unknown and i have only read access??
[none]	[05:27]	<cellofellow>	jimmygoon: yes
[none]	[05:27]	<defrysk>	psyber you could try aptitude dist-upgrade to resolve it, aptitude has more powers
[none]	[05:27]	<Weng_Lap>	Or do I need to start scheduling downtime to bring up systems by hand?
[negative]	[05:27]	<jimmygoon>	cellofellow, thanks, and I feel bad for your 5 instances of nm :(
[positive]	[05:27]	<VeganCheesesteak>	liberion: ok all set :)
[none]	[05:27]	<mboso>	would there be any issue with me ugprading directly from edgy to gutsy without going through fiesty?
[none]	[05:27]	<defrysk>	Psyber, also make sure you have multiverse and universe activated in your sources.list
[none]	[05:27]	<clay3482>	this is probably a silly question but - I after about a week of trying to get it - I give up.  Here is the question - How Can I change the theme of my ubuntu 7.10 install.  The appearance manager tells me that invalid file type for Any theme that I download from art.gnome - Please help
[none]	[05:27]	<cellofellow>	6 actually, miss-counted.
[none]	[05:28]	<koolarry>	THANK YOU!!
[positive]	[05:28]	<Vlet>	xTheGoat121x: I would assume so - unfortunately, I'm on a freebsd system at the moment, so I can't check :)
[none]	[05:28]	<cellofellow>	a simple killall nm-applet gets rid of them, but I get more the next time I log in
[none]	[05:28]	<xTheGoat121x>	mboso, actually, on the site it says to ONLY go from Feisty to Gutsy.
[none]	[05:28]	<IanLiu>	"Is it possible to change the ""Desktop"" folder?"
[none]	[05:28]	<Psyber>	defrysk: what does aptitude do?  BTW, my upgrade last night gave me funky errors about repos and not being able to install some stuff properlly
[none]	[05:28]	<Evanlec>	anyone found a FreeNX package for Gutsy??

[none]	[05:28]	<juanbond>	Gutsy is soo nice
[none]	[05:28]	<cellofellow>	Psyber: aptitude is a more powerful addition to the apt suite. It has more powerful dependancy resolving.
[none]	[05:28]	<juanbond>	I have to admit, installing on my laptop has been really nice.
[none]	[05:28]	<defrysk>	Psyber, aptitude does apt-get with more resolve options
[none]	[05:28]	<cellofellow>	Psyber: and a nice 'gui'.
[none]	[05:29]	<eulogy_>	Psyber: I that is the case, go into administration then software sources and make sure everything on the front tab is checked.
[none]	[05:29]	<ademan>	the livecd hardly works for me... lol, i'm hoping the installer will be better
[none]	[05:29]	<xTheGoat121x>	Vlet, ok, thanks.  I honestly have no need for my files to be indexed or any of that stuff
[positive]	[05:29]	<Evanlec>	defrysk, can u explain what u mean by resolve options?
[none]	[05:29]	<rawake>	anyone here use bongo? i just installed everything and started it up but i can't figure out how i'm supposed to log into the web interface and where i'm supposed to configure it... the docs on the site are pretty vague... can someone point me in the right direction of getting started with bongo?
[none]	[05:29]	<IanLiu>	"Is it possible to change the ""Desktop"" folder name?!"
[positive]	[05:29]	<Vlet>	IanLiu: perhaps you could remove your ~/Desktop and replace it with a symlink called Desktop that points to the location of your choice... not sure if that'll work, but worth a try :)
[none]	[05:29]	<eulogy_>	Psyber: Then run update manager and click check to download any respos. you're missing.
[none]	[05:29]	<IanLiu>	Hmm
[none]	[05:29]	<Pumpitup>	How do i know if compiz is running  and configure it under kde?
[none]	[05:29]	<Vlet>	xTheGoat121x: yeah, I'm just turning that off
[none]	[05:29]	<ademan>	Vlet: i'd think that'd work, but it's kinda a crappy solution
[none]	[05:29]	<iobelisk>	has anybody had the problem of not being able to access certain partitions? and not having write access to root?
[none]	[05:29]	<defrysk>	aptitude can resolve dependencies up to the point to uninstall a complete os to get the package installed
[none]	[05:29]	<cellofellow>	I guess I'll reboot instead of just relogin, and see what happens.
[none]	[05:29]	<ademan>	why not make a symlink somewhere else to ~/Desktop
[none]	[05:29]	<codeshah>	hey guys, is aptitude install very slow for everyone ??
[none]	[05:29]	<codeshah>	right now that is?
[none]	[05:30]	<iobelisk>	codeshah, change your software source serve
[none]	[05:30]	<clay3482>	"jimmy ""what correct tab"""
[none]	[05:30]	<ademan>	codeshah: the servers are under a lot of stress
[none]	[05:30]	<Psyber>	eulogy_: I just ran update manager  it seems to be working... but somethings just are not install properlly
[none]	[05:30]	<mboso>	xTheGoat121x: ok, thanks. will upgrade to fiesty first
[none]	[05:30]	<iobelisk>	server
[none]	[05:30]	<Gunner_Sr>	where can I get more information and talk about i8k?
[none]	[05:30]	<cellofellow>	aptitude installs just quickly, my inet is slow though, so download is slow. Apt of any stripe HOGS bandwidth though.
[none]	[05:30]	<IanLiu>	"It is because my Desktop is translated to Portuguese, which becomes ""Área de Trabalho"" and it is too hard to type.."
[none]	[05:30]	<Vlet>	ademan, IanLiu: yeah it is... then perhaps the path to the users desktop dir is located in the gnome configuration manager
[none]	[05:30]	<codeshah>	ademan, but what should I change them to?... I am using the us.archive... hmm
[none]	[05:30]	<troxor>	IanLiu: there's probably a gconf setting- one sec
[none]	[05:30]	<Evanlec>	defrysk, so aptitude is better in that sense as its more thorough?
[none]	[05:31]	<tuntun>	Is there a way to burn all of the updates as they are downloaded onto a cdrw so I can use them again after reinstalling; and can then it remove any intermediate updates that are superseded?
[none]	[05:31]	<Psyber>	eulogy_  odd software sources were disabled in the sources list
[none]	[05:31]	<Starcraftmazter>	heyai
[none]	[05:31]	<iobelisk>	has anybody had the problem of not being able to access certain partitions? and not having write access to root?
[none]	[05:31]	<musikgoat>	i had a cp crash about half through on a 30gb media files transfer from one disk to another in one machine.   do you think rync would be best to find the files that are not copied to finish the transfer?
[positive]	[05:31]	<ademan>	Vlet: well changing it there would shaft all non-gnome desktop environments, you may not care about this, but most DEs expect your desktop to be at ~/Desktop
[none]	[05:31]	<Starcraftmazter>	how do you upgrade from 7.10 beta to 7.10 ?
[none]	[05:31]	<defrysk>	Evanlec, if used with care it can be better
[none]	[05:31]	<iobelisk>	starcraftmazter: you just update through update manager.
[positive]	[05:31]	<ademan>	musikgoat: rsync can cure cancer, so sure :-p
[none]	[05:31]	<Toma->	!final > Starcraftmazter

[none]	[05:32]	<IanLiu>	Actually, my Ubuntu is in Portuguese, which translates Dektop to another thing. I wanted to turn it back to Desktop

[none]	[05:45]	<Evanlec>	J-_, u can become Linux+ certified from CompTIA thats all i know tho
[none]	[05:45]	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, you can also change the timer frequency of your processor, i bumped mine up to 1000hz which is apparently the best choice for systems requiring fast interactive responses to events
[none]	[05:45]	<troxor>	thebailey: you probably want the restricted driver
[none]	[05:45]	<defrysk>	altbinbpl, no automatix broke gutsy so do a fresh install and stay away from automatix or ask somewhere else
[none]	[05:46]	<musikgoat>	Pie-rate: there are some additions i've read,  I imagine you could update to it, but i don't know if you can get it from the main repo

[none]	[05:51]	<Journeyman>	why when I try to uninstall a dev package it also removes the package the dev package is for
[none]	[05:51]	<MasterShrek>	CapaH, cant you set it in your gnome configurations?
[none]	[05:51]	<christian383>	yes, but only for the cd
[negative]	[05:51]	<gameforge>	Well, I have a list of repo mirrors in Adept... I already tried a Canadian one, there aren't any Mexican ones listed - the page IcemanV9 posted has one, and it shows Gutsy, but I have no way to add it. :(

[none]	[05:51]	<jrib>	jflash: you should upgrade or do a fresh install of 7.10
[positive]	[05:51]	<troxor>	CapaH: if there's an option explicitly defining mouse acceleration in xorg.conf, comment it out
[none]	[05:51]	<MasterShrek>	Journeyman, because the dev packages depends on the original
[none]	[05:51]	<musikgoat>	christian383: i missed what sum you were looking for
[none]	[05:51]	<jflash>	jrib, it's a virtual account, i cant upgrade on my own
[none]	[05:51]	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, oh...but i dont see how processor optimization would really affect boot times...

[none]	[05:52]	<tuntun>	musikgoat: the gutsy dvd
[none]	[05:52]	<christian383>	dont know what you mean...
[none]	[05:52]	<gameforge>	It's OK, I'll just wait until the load lightens up - in the meantime, if anyone is so willing, the Kubuntu Gutsy DVD has about 6 seeders and hundreds of leechers, so if anyone has the ability to help out, it would be greatly appreciated - I've only d/l'd 100 or so megs in over 3 hours on a 7 mbit connection, and I have a 4+ share ratio...
[none]	[05:52]	<chalcedony>	does anyone know about installing Skype on edgy ? E: Couldn't find package skype
[none]	[05:52]	<christian383>	exactly... the ubuntu gutsy dvd
[none]	[05:52]	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, just download it via http then
[none]	[05:53]	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: There's no http download for the Kubuntu Gutsy DVD, just BitTorrent

[none]	[05:53]	<jrib>	jflash: well the only thing that is wrong is the fact it is breezy
[none]	[05:53]	<DanMulvey>	alright guys, i have a noobish question
[none]	[05:53]	<defrysk>	gameforge, why not get the cd ?
[none]	[05:53]	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, i was not aware, why do u want the dvd? cant u just use the cd and install other packages from the net?
[none]	[05:53]	<christian383>	i am already seeding the ubuntu dvd
[none]	[05:53]	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: although the link that uboto provied was helpful, i don't see how to apply the patch
[none]	[05:53]	<Journeyman>	i also keep getting /var/lib/scrollkeeper/lv/scrollkeeper_cl.xml:1: parser error : Document is empt

[positive]	[05:54]	<DanMulvey>	im installing gibbon on my xp laptop, and i want to dual boot, but im not getting an option to resize my partition...any thoughts?
[none]	[05:54]	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, yea....i dunno, it is enticing but it sounds like it could be headaches...not to mention taking a couple hours to compile..
[none]	[05:54]	<macd>	DanMulvey, choose the manual partition option.
[none]	[05:54]	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: 'man patch' is very readable, feel free to ask for details if it is not clear
[none]	[05:54]	<kingnothing>	After updating from 7.04 to 7.10, X is no longer working. I'm getting a fatal error: no screens found. any ideas?
[none]	[05:54]	<Journeyman>	YaY for having to reinstall
[none]	[05:54]	<gameforge>	"defrysk, MasterShrek: Well, I'm trying to upgrade - I don't want to wipe out, I've been upgrading since Dapper... I could do the whole upgrade from the net, but the mirrors are all busy and my ""Find Best Server"" button doesn't work - with the DVD, I could upgrade (mostly) locally."
[positive]	[05:54]	<DanMulvey>	macd: wont that overwrite the xp partition?
[none]	[05:54]	<ezzieyguywuf>	jrib: thanks
[none]	[05:54]	<Journeyman>	!torrent
[none]	[05:54]	<macd>	DanMulvey, no, it will let you resize and partition to install
[none]	[05:54]	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, it takes 45 minutes to an hour, but theres no real headaches if u follow the guide i used, youd have to recompile any extra drivers you had tho (nvidia, etc.)
[none]	[05:54]	<troxor>	DanMulvey: you can also use the gparted livecd if all else fails- it's a pretty neat little util
[none]	[05:55]	<dolphinheadedmar>	troxor,it worked !
[none]	[05:55]	<dolphinheadedmar>	thank you!
[none]	[05:55]	<DanMulvey>	thanks ill try that
[none]	[05:55]	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, you would have been upgraded by now if you wouldnt have decided to use the dvd

[none]	[05:56]	<booh>	on my laptop,  cpu and hdd are always busy... trackerd and mount.ntfs use ressources... like 81%... what is the purpose of trackerd ?
[none]	[05:56]	<gameforge>	MasterShrek: I'm also worried that if my mirror goes down in the middle of the upgrade, it will leave my system borked
[none]	[05:56]	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, got a link to that guide by chance?
[none]	[05:56]	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, no it wont, if it doesnt finish downloading all the packages, it shouldnt try to install any of them
[none]	[05:56]	<MasterShrek>	yea Evanlec one sec...
[none]	[05:56]	<Evanlec>	booh, trackerd is for search function, u can disable in system preferences > services

[none]	[06:00]	<nnonix>	Evanlec: I upgraded also and have the splash screens, but I'm told they are not there if you clean install the final release.
[none]	[06:00]	<MasterShrek>	gameforge, haha, good idea i suppose
[none]	[06:00]	<troxor>	Jordan_U_: it looks like an automatic updater
[none]	[06:00]	<Jordan_U_>	Derek_, Try the alternate install CD

[none]	[06:00]	<wastedfluid>	I don't have a splash on load off the final release.
[none]	[06:00]	<Jordan_U_>	troxor, Is it safe to kill it?
[positive]	[06:00]	<Dr_willis>	i always disable the splash stuff anyway. :)
[none]	[06:00]	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: yes, but you need to be in the right directory and use the appropriate -p for the patch
[none]	[06:00]	<Evanlec>	nnonix, i have not heard anything of the sort
[none]	[06:00]	<wastedfluid>	I don't think it was included in the final cd.
[none]	[06:00]	<MasterShrek>	TECH_1, not really, check the firewall's logs i suppose would be my guess
[none]	[06:00]	<Jordan_U_>	troxor, There is no dpkg lock
[none]	[06:00]	<Evanlec>	nnonix, nor would i be worried about it if it were true

[none]	[06:00]	<wastedfluid>	I'd prefere no splash, any how.  It always seems faster.
[none]	[06:01]	<DShepherd>	haru, you know when ubuntu is booting.. and the progress bar thingy...
[none]	[06:01]	<jrib>	ezzieyguywuf: anything
[positive]	[06:01]	<wastedfluid>	MasterShrek; well, I got screwed of a splash screen I didn't want. :-)

[none]	[06:01]	<haru>	DShepherd, or thats what i call it
[none]	[06:01]	<gameforge>	sanguisdex: about getting the images... the CD image is useless, I may as well use the net, I'm trying to upgrade - the DVD image can only be downloaded from BitTorrent for Kubuntu (and I'm trying on another machine, 5 seeders, hundreds of leechers)
[none]	[06:01]	<MasterShrek>	wastedfluid, well at least u didnt want it lol

[negative]	[06:05]	<[UPG]Pritchard>	I was hoping Ubuntu's new screen resolution configuration tool would allow me to edit the file, but apparently not D:
[none]	[06:05]	<alienseer23>	troxor: this is dolphinheaded on the afflicted ssystem, I typed in 'ps aux | grep dpkg' and got back '1000     17526  0.0  0.0   2976   748 pts/0    R+   01:00   0:00 grep dpkg'
[none]	[06:05]	<Cale>	Is there a convenient way to put together a restricted-modules package for a self-compiled kernel?
[none]	[06:05]	<kingnothing>	i can't get X to work after updating from 7.04 to 7.10. help, anyone?
[none]	[06:06]	<jrib>	!kernel > Cale (read the private message from ubotu)
[none]	[06:06]	<MasterShrek>	Evanlec, ic, i did that with the rc as well, then kept up-to-date until it stopped giving updates a few days ago
[none]	[06:06]	<tritium>	Cale: why are you bothering with your own kernel?
[none]	[06:06]	<[UPG]Pritchard>	@jordon:  It's worked for me before after manually editing the file.  ubuntu detects the proper card type and everything.
[none]	[06:06]	<Jordan_U_>	kingnothing, X won't start at all?
[none]	[06:06]	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U: no
[none]	[06:06]	<MasterShrek>	booh, that could possibly be a problem, is it a newer laptop?
[none]	[06:06]	<Cale>	Because I need reiser 4 support.
[none]	[06:06]	<troxor>	fnadeau: there is a switch, iirc, on the audigy (you can find it in alsamixer, among others) for optical out, which effectively disables analog output
[none]	[06:06]	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, it was givin me updates yesterday, but nothing today, i assumed because of all the traffic
[none]	[06:06]	<Fat_Ferret>	"Evening all, got a problem I installed 7.10 and it was working great I restarted and its telling me ""initramfs - failed to set xfermode"""
[none]	[06:06]	<booh>	MasterShrek, I have dual boot with Vista and it's at most same thing
[none]	[06:06]	<meta-paonia>	graphics card - I may be having the same problem
[none]	[06:06]	<drew_>	any clues on why my old thinkpad's extra keys don't work anymore (feisty -> gutsy)? hotkey-setup package?
[none]	[06:06]	<booh>	MasterShrek, Yes, less than 2 months ago
[none]	[06:06]	<troxor>	alienseer23: nothing that says dpkg <defunct> or anything like that?
[none]	[06:06]	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U: in the gdm log file, I get an error... fatal server error: no screens found
[positive]	[06:06]	<Jordan_U_>	kingnothing, Good, that would mean something was really broken if that happened in Gutsy :)
[none]	[06:06]	<Cale>	Unless you happen to know of a convenient package for a reiser 4 module.
[none]	[06:07]	<foxjazz>	does the xfi run on ubuntu yet?
[none]	[06:07]	<oldmanstan>	so much for bulletproof x
[none]	[06:07]	<tritium>	Cale: no, I avoid reiser even more than I do the plague
[none]	[06:07]	<alienseer23>	troxor:no, only what i put in my last comment
[none]	[06:07]	<_Codeman_>	Is anyone else having problems downloading packages?
[none]	[06:07]	<oldmanstan>	_Codeman_: yes everyone is
[none]	[06:07]	<troxor>	alienseer23: ok, that's good- did you give it some time?
[none]	[06:07]	<dystopianray>	foxjazz: maybe, you have to install and configure the drivers yourself though
[none]	[06:07]	<Jordan_U_>	oldmanstan, No, it did work for kingnothing , unless it isn't working for you
[none]	[06:07]	<tritium>	_Codeman_: many are, as the servers are being hammered right now
[none]	[06:07]	<fnadeau>	troxor: problem solved... who is the dude that made that option enable by default???
[none]	[06:07]	<oldmanstan>	_Codeman_: it's because new version just got released, everyone is installing
[none]	[06:07]	<kyled185>	_Codeman_: I've been having trouble all day, servers must be on fire or something
[none]	[06:07]	<alienseer23>	should I go to term and do 'sudo aptitude upgrade'?
[none]	[06:07]	<MasterShrek>	booh, interesting, im not really sure what the problem might be, u say u have the same problems with vista or no? other than just the crappy vista stuff
[none]	[06:07]	<_Codeman_>	K, thought so
[none]	[06:07]	<foxjazz>	dystopianray are there drivers?
[none]	[06:07]	<defrysk>	Cale, reiser4progs perhaps ?
[none]	[06:07]	<DShepherd>	_Codeman_, yeah.. try another server
[none]	[06:07]	<Cale>	So, uh, yeah, is there a convenient way to build myself a restricted-drivers package for my custom kernel, or do I just have to install that stuff separately?
[none]	[06:08]	<_Codeman_>	Good thing I upgraded yesterday
[none]	[06:08]	<oldmanstan>	Jordan_U_: oh mine works peachy, i was just editorializing
[none]	[06:08]	<alienseer23>	troxor: yes
[none]	[06:08]	<Cale>	defrysk: That's just user tools.
[none]	[06:08]	<alienseer23>	still froze
[none]	[06:08]	<dystopianray>	foxjazz: yes, creative released x-fi drivers for linux
[none]	[06:08]	<kingnothing>	Jordan_U: I updated from the alternate CD downloaded through a torrent. the update servers are hosed
[positive]	[06:08]	<troxor>	fnadeau: I don't think it was a default, but regardless, I'm not too sure how it gets enabled though :)
[none]	[06:08]	<MasterShrek>	Cale, i would just do it seperately
[none]	[06:08]	<SunmanXII>	quick question - is there a way to queue files to xmms in terminal
[none]	[06:08]	<defrysk>	Cale, libaal-dev perhaps ?
[positive]	[06:08]	<Evanlec>	MasterShrek, this article is a decent read: http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/10/16/64-bit_more_than_just_the_ram/1
[none]	[06:08]	<booh>	MasterShrek, Vista is slow too... but I though it was vista... and now, ubuntu is slow too but only when it needs access to hard drive.

[none]	[06:09]	<Jordan_U_>	kingnothing, The alternate CD does not contain the ATI / Nvidia drivers AFIK

[none]	[06:11]	<Pie-rate>	ok, the ubuntu installer *commented out* the security.ubuntu.com entries in sources.list, because it couldn't find security.ubuntu.com because i hadn't connected to my wifi ap. WHY? if it can't find them on install, it should assume that the user will get teh internets working later, not comment out the security repo.
[none]	[06:11]	<troxor>	alienseer23: did you try apt-get update/upgrade from command line, with the same results?

[none]	[06:16]	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: you don't have to do that.  You just tell the installer not to format the partition in gparted
[none]	[06:16]	<Evanlec>	defrysk, he can also just install to a new partition like i did, and just mount the old installation and transfer stuff over

[none]	[06:16]	<Pie-rate>	gutsy install on my laptop gave me a black screen. disappointing.

[none]	[06:16]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, nope
[none]	[06:16]	<pazsion>	so how do i kno if my vid cards are enabled?
[none]	[06:16]	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, not if he wants a fresh install
[none]	[06:16]	<dWho>	no dialog
[none]	[06:16]	<dWho>	no nohing
[none]	[06:17]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, upgrading to gutsy has been a pain

[none]	[06:17]	<dystopianray>	pazsion: do you see anything on the screen?
[none]	[06:17]	<defrysk>	Evanlec, that why i did the !backup which did not work :9

[none]	[06:17]	<pazsion>	i see everything i'm doing
[none]	[06:17]	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: i do it all the time, what do u mean?  You setup the partitions you setup your /home to be mounted, just not formated.  That way all the data in the /home partition is in tact.
[negative]	[06:17]	<haru>	how do i make the clock look like this http://www.novell.com/connectionmagazine/2007/q2/img/tt6_02.gif

[none]	[06:17]	<dystopianray>	pazsion: then your video cards are working
[none]	[06:17]	<Evanlec>	defrysk, what?
[none]	[06:17]	<pazsion>	lol
[none]	[06:17]	<Pie-rate>	oh, usplash being a buggy piece of crap as usual
[none]	[06:17]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, i had to revert to a clean install for two of them
[none]	[06:17]	<defrysk>	Evanlec, nm , I need a break
[none]	[06:17]	<defrysk>	;S

[none]	[06:18]	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : use alt+f2 then typed it in the box.. nothing happen
[none]	[06:18]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, know anything about usplash setting its resolutions?
[positive]	[06:18]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: bummer. At least only one belongs to me, but that's not saying much
[none]	[06:18]	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: unless i'm confused
[none]	[06:18]	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, forget it
[none]	[06:18]	<Jordan_U_>	dWho, Start it from a terminal

[none]	[06:18]	<CapaH>	I just upgraded to Gutsy from Feisty and I am having a ton of problems. Compiz settings do not work. My mouse somehow became super sensitive (and I cannot seem to find how to reduce the sensitivity) -- can anyone help me on this?
[none]	[06:18]	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, Works for me, I just don't like that it is half impossible to create a new theme for it
[none]	[06:18]	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, u mount the original root partition, and delete all the other dirs /bin /etc /sys ... and then unmount it and start the install without formatting
[none]	[06:19]	<dWho>	Jordan_U_ : yes... nothing happens then back to the prompt

[positive]	[06:19]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: disabling usplash? For me, it's an fglrx bug

[positive]	[06:19]	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: oh i see.  didn't realize /home wasn't on a seperate partition.  But yah in that case i'd go one more step and create another partition and copy /home to it then format over everything.. :)

[none]	[06:20]	<prince>	Jordan_U_: hmm
[none]	[06:20]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, am i missing a step?
[none]	[06:20]	<Jordan_U_>	Pie-rate, That sounds like a frame buffer problem rather than a usplash problem, but try splashy anyway
[none]	[06:20]	<MasterShrek>	thedonvaughn, yea, well i didnt know if his /home dir was on a different partition anyways, and i forgot who was asking too lol
[none]	[06:20]	<thedonvaughn>	MasterShrek: heh
[none]	[06:20]	<tronyx>	ahhhh why do random people keep saying my name, i think you mean troxor?

[none]	[06:20]	<Pie-rate>	X works, usplash doesn't.
[positive]	[06:20]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: possibly setting the vga= for the kernel line? That's just an uneducated guess, though

[none]	[06:21]	<tronyx>	lol no worries troxor, we're just 2 cool people
[none]	[06:21]	<Flannel>	Logicwax: Thats more than likely true, yes.  Automatix breaks things.

[positive]	[06:23]	<troxor>	haru: your best bet is to wait until it becomes available: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/gutsy/+source/intlclock   if you're impatient, you can check getdeb.net, to see if there's a package available sooner (but be aware these aren't official packages). if you're really impatient, you can scrounge up the source and compile it yourself  :)
[none]	[06:24]	<silent>	CapaH, I'd recommend a clean install... the amount of time the upgrade will take you could have everything up and running on clean
[negative]	[06:24]	<riotkittie>	i'm going to stick to calling it 8.04 or risk total embarassment. D:
[none]	[06:24]	<silent>	CapaH, really not kidding, just back up your /home and config files and clean
[none]	[06:24]	<meta-paonia>	IMHO - Ubuntu has gone waaaahhhhhh,,,,, information overload, to upgrade or not to upgrade, I would love to have the option to take modules from one kernel and port it into the new kernel, things get buggy- note for kernel team:ATI Radion 200 fails on some systems, esp. Celeron D - And it drops support for some processors - esp Geode 200/300mhz - what happened to a massive driver database??? I have lots of questions - I have been using

[none]	[06:24]	<Pie-rate>	Jordan_U_: damnit, the splash screen is the first thing a new user sees when they install ubuntu. it really pisses me off that they can't get it right. it's broken for me one way or another on at least 3 separate computers

[none]	[06:30]	<silent>	tuntun, you could backup your package files
[none]	[06:31]	<DIguana>	They need to make apt use P2P for downloads. That'd prevent things from slowing to a crawl on Upgrade Day.

[none]	[06:45]	<bluebanana>	But isn't there any advantage to doing a fresh install to 7.10, as opposed to upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10? Thank you.

[none]	[06:46]	<bluebanana>	Jordan_U, upgrade should be done in 20 hours, you reckon?
[none]	[06:46]	<nickrud>	bluebanana: upgrade keeps and upgrades all your current packages, you don't have to reselect & reinstall. For me, that's the defining line
[none]	[06:46]	<novanosis>	This is horrible how do you people not make flash work off the bat in your new release? It makes no sense.
[positive]	[06:46]	<Jordan_U_>	XsteelWolf, That will get you gcc, make and the like, it won't get you a DE ( but that's why you have vim ;)

[none]	[06:47]	<riotkittie>	Avariel: because the repositories are getting slammed
[none]	[06:47]	<tritium>	Avariel: overloaded servers

[none]	[06:47]	<bluebanana>	nickrud, is there a way to do an upgrade that mimics a fresh install?
[none]	[06:47]	<nickrud>	bluebanana: incomplete ones, many traceable to automatix & envy I believe.
[none]	[06:47]	<ia1>	novanosis: flash is proprietary, sometimes it's hard to make proprietary things work.  note that Microsoft didn't make it work in Windows, Adobe did...

[none]	[06:48]	<troxor>	zak, I'd say the best bet would be to rsync your homedir and anything of value, and wipe stuff- but this isn't the only option
[none]	[06:48]	<bluebanana>	"nickrud, ""mimes""?"
[none]	[06:48]	<Avariel>	damn....worst part is my attempt at upgrading failed miserably when it came to external output through dvi to monitor

[none]	[07:22]	<chowmeined>	dougb: might be able to hack it together with cd paranoia
[none]	[07:22]	<Flannel>	pengo: No, but I heard something about booting straight to ubiquity, try entering `only-ubiquity` for a boot option at the boot menu

[none]	[07:22]	<robert_>	automake is broken
[none]	[07:22]	<caner>	<inspired> it must be Bitsream Vera Sans but i am not sure
[none]	[07:22]	<DARKGuy>	dougb, mp3 isn't a free format, therefore the default is OGG because it's free and all that, but I think you can do it with some other programs and the needed codecs, provided you're allowed to get them legally o,o
[positive]	[07:22]	<dougb>	chowmeined: tell that to my ipod :-P
[none]	[07:22]	<chowmeined>	dougb: and it will play better under linux

[none]	[07:22]	<chowmeined>	dougb: ah...
[none]	[07:22]	<kdubois>	caner: hmm, thats unfortunate. Intel has great OSS drivers, aTi's are coming down the pipes, but nvidia's are still closed up...
[none]	[07:22]	<dougb>	i know OGG sounds better, and i'm all for using it

[none]	[07:23]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:wine or cedega?
[none]	[07:23]	<WaltzingAlong>	probably the audio is ripped to vorbis but in the ogg container. referring to them sholud be oggvorbis; other things can bet inside .ogg files like theora
[none]	[07:23]	<kdubois>	robert_ theres a lot of macros in dev packages you should look into getting if you want to get automake running smoothly
[none]	[07:23]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, haven't checked but it's always almost the same I get on win
[none]	[07:23]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, wine

[positive]	[07:24]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, lucky for you :P mine's a GF4 Ti 4200
[none]	[07:24]	<nickrud>	youser: yes, no data loss, but you'll still end up getting packages off the net (the ones you got from the net for feisty)
[none]	[07:24]	<robert_>	"kdubois, Can't locate object method ""good_version"" via package ""Autom4te::C4che"" at /usr/bin/autom4te line 984."
[none]	[07:24]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:on my desktop :|
[none]	[07:24]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, maybe it needs the drivers
[none]	[07:24]	<arooni>	folks: i have ubuntu 7.04 and 3 hard drives.  recently i have had to restart my computer via power button cuz it was freezing.  anyways, now: two hard drives don't show up in BIOS, *AND* when fsck runs on startup, it fails with exit status 8 (operational error) on the one hard drive the bios sitll sees.... which is the one that contains the root file system, home, swap .... any ideas on what i should do to fix?
[none]	[07:24]	<riotkittie>	JWay: hows about you tell us your problem, and we see if we can fix it
[none]	[07:24]	<Haruno>	theres a list of hardware not supported under gutsy right now (anymore)?
[none]	[07:24]	<jmworx>	WaltzingAlong: All the tools I know of put Speex in Ogg (.spx files are ogg files)
[none]	[07:24]	<youser>	hhmm
[none]	[07:24]	<caner>	<kdubois> but if all the nvidia users have such problems with gutsy, it will not be good because the bug is really annoying
[negative]	[07:24]	<DARKGuy>	tuntun, I dunno if Gutsy has an automatic way, Feisty didn't :/
[none]	[07:25]	<Flannel>	youser: If you have the desktop CD, you'dhave to reinstall (you could reinstall around your home partition, if you have a separate one), if you download the alternate CD, you can use that to upgrade from
[none]	[07:25]	<arooni>	oops
[none]	[07:25]	<kdubois>	robert, make sure autotools, libtool, etc are all installed properly. I was disappointed w/ what was installed by default
[none]	[07:25]	<Jordan_U_>	youser, If you download the DVD then you will have to grab from the repos for fewer packages
[none]	[07:25]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:hey how did you isntall re
[none]	[07:25]	<youser>	i upgraded to feisty from a a dapper cd
[none]	[07:25]	<WaltzingAlong>	jmworx: ok great thanks
[none]	[07:25]	<kdubois>	caner: its likely just the type of card you have, mine is working pretty well
[none]	[07:25]	<crayner>	help
[positive]	[07:25]	<Night_XX>	kdubois: we use to sleep in the night :)
[none]	[07:25]	<DARKGuy>	"neohaker, try opening a terminal and type "" glxinfo | grep 'render' "" ... if it says Direct Rendering: Yes, then you have 3D acceleration, else you've got to find the drivers"
[none]	[07:25]	<dougb>	yea idk if i want to invest in another mp3 player.  i just bought this nokia n800 and i can put up to 16 GB's of storage on it i think, which is a lot less than buying an MP3 player
[none]	[07:25]	<crayner>	my update manager crashes when updating to gutsy gibbon
[none]	[07:25]	<dougb>	i would have to think that the nokia N800 can play OGG since it's based of debian
[none]	[07:25]	<chowmeined>	dougb: ok
[none]	[07:25]	<youser>	i just want to keep my settings and home folder and windows boot
[none]	[07:26]	<kdubois>	Night_XX: yeah, but then we became hackers and replaced sleep with caffiene....
[none]	[07:26]	<ChrisGordon>	Ok, so I ran those 2 lines and I went back to try the update manger, and It still doesnt work...
[none]	[07:26]	<youser>	but update manager is poocheed
[none]	[07:26]	<JWay>	When I click on a workspace other than the primary, I get to see the background picture and no menu or nothing. Switching workspaces is not possible with ctrl + alt + left/right at all. I can run a terminal and use alt + f2 to run programs, but switching workspaces is completely impossible
[none]	[07:26]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, if it's nVIDIA or ATI usually you go to System -> Admin. -> Restricted Drivers Manager
[none]	[07:26]	<platinum123>	i have a gutsy dvd - is it possible to upgrade my existing feisty without using the update manager to fetch the files online?
[none]	[07:26]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:answer is yes
[none]	[07:26]	<robert_>	kdubois, I'm going to re-install automake, autoconf, and m4. anything else?
[none]	[07:26]	<sorsis>	dougb: N800 is based on debian??

[none]	[07:26]	<dougb>	yup yup
[none]	[07:26]	<Haruno>	crayner: maybe its not crashing, it can easily take *some* while...
[positive]	[07:26]	<Night_XX>	kdubois: :DDD
[none]	[07:26]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:mine is nvidai 6600gt

[none]	[07:27]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:nope bro
[none]	[07:27]	<WaltzingAlong>	jmworx: is there such a tool as vorbisgain for speex?
[none]	[07:27]	<neohaker>	i cheked all that
[none]	[07:27]	<kdubois>	robert_ reinstalling is probably not the problem here, you might be missing a development package for whatever you're compiling. what are you trying to compile?
[none]	[07:27]	<tuntun>	"DARKGuy/riotkittie: I have ""keep aligned"" selected, but I would like it the way it is in windows"

[negative]	[07:27]	<DARKGuy>	tuntun, ah, automatic ordering? I don't think they've added that to nautilus yet :(
[none]	[07:27]	<Flannel>	platinum123: `sudo apt-cdrom add` should add it (even though its a dvd)
[none]	[07:28]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:still i get bad fps he gets 100
[none]	[07:28]	<robert_>	kdubois, the version that apt installs segfaults
[none]	[07:28]	<ChrisGordon>	I tried doing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade and that didnt fix my manager
[none]	[07:28]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, hm, try changing the video stuff to D3D or OpenGL and see (in CS)
[none]	[07:28]	<kdubois>	caner, it doesnt do that w/ a geforce 8500. also make sure you have the right driver installed, you may need a legacy one...
[none]	[07:28]	<snadge>	how come i can telnet to port 80 of a website and GET / .. but firefox just stalls and times out.. sometimes when i telnet to a  host, it resolves as 1.0.0.0 .. then if i ping it the correct ip comes up.. gutsy 64bit.. any ideas?
[negative]	[07:28]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:mylaunghing options itslf has opengl :(
[positive]	[07:28]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, I would've said it's the drivers but you have 3D acceleration so it's not that and I'm running out of clues xD
[none]	[07:28]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i removed cs
[positive]	[07:28]	<mbt>	Anyone running Gutsy AMD64 having showstopper issues with OpenOffice.org?  I am experiencing very frequent and hard crashes when I do just about anything in it.
[none]	[07:28]	<chowmeined>	snadge: proxy?
[negative]	[07:29]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, you could try asking in #winehq, they're the wine gurus and might help you a bit more :$
[positive]	[07:29]	<snadge>	no proxy is required.. windows xp and ubuntu feisty works fine on the exact same machine
[none]	[07:29]	<caner>	<kdubois> i didnt select it. just installed using restricted drivers manager
[none]	[07:29]	<rayb0t>	"i'm installing gutsy right now, it's at the ""scanning the mirror"" part, and its taking forever. is this due to the load on the servers?"
[positive]	[07:29]	<neohaker>	DARKGuy:i:D
[none]	[07:29]	<chowmeined>	snadge: no for some reason do you have the proxy enabled
[none]	[07:29]	<robert_>	kdubois, the problem is that config.guess doesn't correctly identify my host/cpu type.
[none]	[07:29]	<youser>	so i can download gutsy from torrent and either run or install it? i cant download the upgrade managerr files? via torrent?
[none]	[07:29]	<snadge>	its set to direct connection.. does this on both livecd and after install
[none]	[07:29]	<mbt>	rayb0t: I would presume so.  Installing packages has been very slow for me tonight, too.

It worked with my wirless router before .  I have not changed anything besides the router . Oh and my lan port don't work either so I am . can I just install wirelles card  and then use programs to see the wirelless router and connects me to it or do I have to use iwconfig
[none]	[07:29]	<ubuntu_>	hai
[positive]	[07:29]	<rayb0t>	"mbt: yeah. i dont need any packages, i just need to finish the install. it should have a ""skip this part"" button :P"
[none]	[07:30]	<rayb0t>	or maybe it should time out faster
[none]	[07:30]	<rredd4>	ChrisGordon  you can go to Synaptic, remove update manager and reinstall it
[none]	[07:30]	<ubuntu_>	do want my ubantu freeeeee versions
[none]	[07:30]	<tuntun>	DARKGuy/riotkittie: automatic ordering. I don't think thats it, I would prefer it that desktop icons cant become slightly mis allingned
[none]	[07:30]	<robert_>	perfect
[none]	[07:30]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, 0.9.47, latest one
[none]	[07:30]	<kdubois>	robert_ you may also want to try other versions of automake. some sources only work w/ older versions, its why they're still in the repos...
[none]	[07:30]	<ubuntu_>	thanks
[none]	[07:30]	<mbt>	rayb0t: True.  I think that part of the setup is to create the cache of available packages from the servers.
[none]	[07:30]	<rayb0t>	probably
[none]	[07:30]	<youser>	right now feisty runs fine but my  video card isnot compaatible

[none]	[07:32]	<kdubois>	youser: white/black screens in 3d accelerated windows are likely due to a lack of texture rendering memory
[none]	[07:32]	<youser>	weak cuz i have tons of ram too
[none]	[07:32]	<mbt>	Yep... I have to have OOo for school, and really I need a lot of the functionality in Gutsy, too.  But I haven't been able to talk it into working right.

[positive]	[07:34]	<DARKGuy>	neohaker, naaah, it's just a small video/WINE issue, easy to fix for them :p
[none]	[07:34]	<chowmeined>	Jordan_U_: they are 1 1/2 pages (so uses 2 pages when printing) instead of 1

[none]	[08:06]	<Lunz>	riotkittie,i did install the driver and setting exactly the same from 7.04..but it doesnt work on gutsy..
[none]	[08:06]	<ace1>	hi everyone
[none]	[08:06]	<scguy318>	hallo
[none]	[08:06]	<Broma>	well i don't get the cube desktop feature and it doesn't appear anything realyl changes after running it
[none]	[08:06]	<wolfmanz>	anyone having issues with firefox displaying web pages properly?
[negative]	[08:06]	<riotkittie>	Lunz: :(
[none]	[08:06]	<lewis1711>	how do I get permission to copy and paste files?
[none]	[08:06]	<Lunz>	riotkittie,it cant detect the wireless signal but couldnt connect..
[none]	[08:06]	<lewis1711>	and delete them and move them and all that
[none]	[08:07]	<ace1>	i've been screwing around with kismet, just upgraded to 7.10 and it's dropping out after 2-3mins.. works fine then goes dead, can't get a power reading or anything. i've been checking the forums and such and wanted to try removing wpa_supplicant, does anyone know how to go about doing that?
[none]	[08:07]	<AMDfanboy>	"hey, i'm looking at the software sources in synaptic.  i see these two under 3rd party......  ""partner""  and ""partner (source code)"".  i don't recognize these?  what are they?  thanks!"
[none]	[08:07]	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, in your own user directory, you should already have those permissions. The system owns the root area, though.
[none]	[08:07]	<riotkittie>	Broma: have you enabled Cube? IIRC, Gutsy defaults to Desktop wall and you need to install compizconfig-settings-manager to disable that, and enable cube [assuming you are using 7.10]
[none]	[08:07]	<Lunz>	scguy318,it cant detect the wireless signal but couldnt connect..
[none]	[08:07]	<tritium>	riotkittie++

[none]	[08:08]	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, basically, yes
[none]	[08:08]	<Broma>	let me try that ( I am using 7.10)
[none]	[08:08]	<eikke>	"is it ""normal"" there are no module/.ko files in my generated initrd? -> causes my lvm2 system not to boot, I think"
[none]	[08:08]	<Lunz>	riotkittie,it just works fine with 7.04 and should be working on gutsy..
[none]	[08:08]	<eikke>	(ie since update to 7.10)
[none]	[08:08]	<lewis1711>	Madpilot, how do I then give myself permission to copy paste all files?
[none]	[08:08]	<scguy318>	Lunz: can you check what lsmod | grep ndiswrapper has?
[none]	[08:08]	<lewis1711>	and also it says I don't have permission to run .deb installation files

[none]	[08:09]	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, generally, you don't. for deb files, leave them on your desktop then just double-click them
[none]	[08:09]	<Ex-Cyber>	"I just upgraded from Feisty to Gutsy via the DVD, and now Update Manager wants to do a ""partial upgrade""; is this normal/safe, and how can I find details on what is causing it?"

[none]	[08:10]	<scguy318>	Avariel: np
[none]	[08:10]	<Madpilot>	lewis1711, odd. right-click on the .deb, choose Properties -what does that say about ownership?

[none]	[08:11]	<Broma>	root what do I need to do to enable cube after installing the compizconfig?
[none]	[08:11]	<Zambezi>	Gutsy can't find my 3Com-nic. That's really bad.
[none]	[08:11]	<riotkittie>	Lunz: i'm not sure if this is relevant but i have an rt2500usb. i blacklisted that, and then blacklisted the newer driver [rt2x00...]  as well. i'm not sure that i /had/ to, but i'm assuming that if i'd been able to connect without doing it, i'd not have bothered.
[none]	[08:11]	<lewis1711>	Madpilot: owner: (account I'm on now) access: read and write.
[none]	[08:11]	<bobader>	I want MD5SUM for 7.10 iso file ?
[none]	[08:12]	<riotkittie>	Lunz: so you may want to try blacklisting rt2x00pci or rt2x00usb or whatever is appropriate
[positive]	[08:12]	<ace1>	fanboy, if you have trouble with anything on those lists should be easy enough to uncheck em an remove em :o)

[none]	[11:03]	<Necrosan_>	building a kernel took me forever, by the way
[none]	[11:03]	<flick>	XarZen: you have to install Ubuntu in a different partition by choosing manual in the disc/partition selection instead of guided, etc
[positive]	[11:03]	<jotil>	XarZen: dual boot means you can either have XP or Linux running at one time.
[none]	[11:03]	<wildintellect>	Rabiddog, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade I think

[none]	[11:03]	<XarZen>	jotil: yeah, ok

[none]	[11:04]	<gordonjcp>	Sevk: ah
[none]	[11:04]	<cwill1>	IdleOne: apt-get dist-upgrade is just the smart upgrade (dependency tracking), I don't think it invokes the full distribution upgrade
[none]	[11:04]	<Ninjao>	im on it atm.. but its just the install
[none]	[11:04]	<XarZen>	wildintellect, instead of installing permanent you mean?

[none]	[12:02]	<whitedeth>	wanna pm me the details?
[none]	[12:02]	<flokuehn>	CroX: it maybe that you have to reconfigure your xorg file
[none]	[12:03]	<flokuehn>	CroX: you know how it works?
[none]	[12:03]	<whitedeth>	im not a pro with ubuntu. I'm not quite sure where im even supposed to be putting it in.
[none]	[12:03]	<jotil>	whitedeth: the servers seems to be overloaded. every time i apt something, it takes a while to start downloading and the speed is slow!
[none]	[12:03]	<choudesh>	whitedeth, first try mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu if that doesn't work - I will send you the stuff for thor.houdeshell.net
[none]	[12:03]	<CroX>	flokuehn: I fixed it. But when I fixed it, it complained about some error configuring XKB. But apparently it works now.
[none]	[12:04]	<flokuehn>	CroX: ok
[none]	[12:04]	<flokuehn>	nice
[none]	[12:04]	<Bo^Dick>	it looks like the installer actually downloads the package every time

[none]	[12:04]	<flokuehn>	CroX: maybe you can fix the xkb error by reconfiguring your xserver
[none]	[12:04]	<Tigerman>	hello again
[none]	[12:04]	<Tigerman>	i have a problem
[none]	[12:04]	<flokuehn>	CroX: but you have to google for it before doing so
[none]	[12:04]	<subwaydesign>	i couldn't find any solution for my grub problem on those sites
[none]	[12:04]	<Bo^Dick>	now lets see if the installer will complain about the checksum

[none]	[13:00]	<momal>	Brendanj: It seems to just return that it is gutsy... hmm maybe i should run the upgrade and see what it does
[none]	[13:00]	<IdleOne>	rjonesx: not sure what that means but you could try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop for gnome or kubuntu-desktop ( kde ) and re-install/install a GUI
[none]	[13:00]	<garu>	Maligan wireless problems?
[none]	[13:00]	<Maligen>	yes

[none]	[13:02]	<compengi>	jrib, Okay, thanks a lot
[none]	[13:02]	<ramvi>	jrib, but that hasnt happened. So now Im taking the matter in my own hands
[none]	[13:02]	<Innomen>	Whats a polite time to wait before repeating a request?
[none]	[13:02]	<mbone>	I can't upgrade to 7.10

[none]	[13:03]	<Helvasca>	mbone, what errors are you getting, are you doing an install from a live cd/alternate install or are you using the dist upgrade from feisty?
[positive]	[13:03]	<Maligen>	so I think the system detects it :P
[none]	[13:04]	<mbone>	Helvasca: I can't find the upgrade to 7.10 in Update Manager, and I already read a similiar problem in ubuntu forum too. Nothing helps so far

[none]	[15:19]	<jrib>	Fant: I have to go in a bit, but assume you have main, restricted, universe and multiverse pointing at gutsy.  Just apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade, if no errors, then you are on gutsy.  You can run apt-get install -f to try to resolve broken packages.  dpkg --configure -a to check for packages not configured
[none]	[15:19]	<seamus7>	rflmnz: my next suggestion would be to find someone more advanced than I am to help you ... perhaps try the #compiz channel

[none]	[15:26]	<Ryuho>	hubuntu does it get to the login screen?
[none]	[15:26]	<Fant>	mc44:  well either the gutsy nv driver or the nvidia one will boot into x, but only the background loads. you can tell that gnome-panel is attempting to load because it flashes at the bottom a few times and then you are stuck on the background picture.  you cant bring up anything at that point
[none]	[15:26]	<geefinator>	kuro:  you might be able to get it to work, but with my shitty ati vid card all i could get was clone.

[none]	[16:01]	<mrj>	"K3nt0, you want to ""boot the livecd"" from a ""usb harddrive or anything not including burning a CD""...... I'm missing your logic here"

[none]	[16:01]	<Shapeshifter->	I configured my lap top screen to turn off if I close the lid. The problem is that it turns on again if I accidentally move the mouse. Is there a way to fix this or cut off mouse input when the lid is closed? It would actually be ideal if the USB port where the mouse is connected would be disabled on closing the lid (so that the mouse is turned off completely)
[none]	[16:01]	<bruenig>	MrKeuner, redownloading the file is nonsense, the error is with a script inside the package

[negative]	[16:03]	<jotil>	i am not installing anything for the next few days. why won't people use torrents and get an alternate CD and upgrade from there? :'(
[positive]	[16:03]	<Vlet>	dystopianray: oh sorry, I thought you said it should :)
[none]	[16:03]	<copyofjohan>	fyrestrtr: I worked it out: gnome-desktop-environment is the metapackage

[none]	[16:26]	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, Gnome 2.2.. failsafe works but normal only gets through half way before kicking me back to login prompt
[none]	[16:27]	<danielbw>	master is a switch instead of a sliding scale
[none]	[16:27]	<shortnick>	genii then how can i upgrade ??? do i need to install ubuntu all over again ??  i was hoping to use apt-get install -y distro
[none]	[16:27]	<zamarax>	what is weird is its always the exact same sources
[none]	[16:27]	<Sp0tUb>	pike_ Its called sdb1, then i type sudo unmount /media/sdb1
[none]	[16:27]	<danielbw>	ubersoldat master is a switch instead of a sliding scale
[none]	[16:27]	<d2dchat>	MasterShrek, do u think it could be an incompatible start up process?
[none]	[16:27]	<tsukasa>	MickoD, if it can see it, then you might want to try reformatting the partition your going to use for linux (eg sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/xxx1)
[none]	[16:27]	<MasterShrek>	d2dchat, try creating a new user and see if they can log in, im pretty sure its some config files somewhere in your users directory
[none]	[16:27]	<Ubersoldat>	danielbw: switch? weird
[none]	[16:27]	<KL>	???
[none]	[16:27]	<xander21c>	hello
[none]	[16:27]	<maccam94>	TheRepacker, been there, done that
[none]	[16:27]	<tsukasa>	MickoD, assuming 1 is the right partition number, fdisk will tell you

[none]	[16:27]	<Ubersoldat>	danielbw: but you do have sound then
[none]	[16:27]	<xander21c>	anyone has the torrent for xubuntu gutsy
[none]	[16:27]	<danielbw>	Ubersoldat: maybe not a switch but I can only mute and unmute it.
[negative]	[16:27]	<genii>	shortnick: For upgrade instructions from 5.10->6.06->6.10->7.04->7.10   see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[none]	[16:27]	<maccam94>	TheRepacker, it's like xorg.conf is being ignored and it just goes straight to a failsafe
[none]	[16:27]	<MasterShrek>	!automatix | russ
[none]	[16:27]	<Vlet>	zamarax: I have a suspicion that your problem is also that you need to change your mirror in the 'software sources' control panel
[negative]	[16:27]	<Ubotwo>	russ: Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.

[none]	[16:27]	<danielbw>	Ubersoldat: I do have sound but it is very faint

[none]	[16:28]	<tsukasa>	MickoD, also after you run mkfs.ext3 to format the partition reboot into the livecd again, the installer has some issues sometimes
[none]	[16:28]	<danielbw>	ubersoldat i have heard this thing crank out a lot more noise using opensuse.

[none]	[16:40]	<abhibera>	MasterShrek: universe is enabled
[none]	[16:40]	<genii>	shortnick: I did a lookup on your IP, it seems in Portugal. Since you are going 5.10 -> 6.06 first step, all mirrors still contain 6.06. the portugeuese mirror seems currently overloaded however, due to 7.10 release. You may want to try an alternate, or wait a few days or so for things to quiet down.
[none]	[16:40]	<Jeriath>	ok, im rying to run firestarter at startup...problem is it has to be run as root user
[none]	[16:40]	<Jeriath>	anyoen knwo how to do this
[none]	[16:40]	<mcquaid>	Obviously you can't apply unix like permissions to the ntfs part, but what my buddy wants is for his ubuntu account to have read/write to the ntfs part, which in will by default, but for others to only have read to the ntfs part

[none]	[16:41]	<MasterShrek>	abhibera, type: echo $PATH     and give me the output, because if gcc is in /usr/bin you should be able to access it, its strange that its giving you an error...btw what are you trying to compile?

[none]	[17:02]	<computerex>	@Greencookie, it took me like 25 minutes to install it, and activate compiz fusion
[none]	[17:02]	<agentSG>	Question with 7.10: Have ATI card. Desktop effects were working before the upgrade from 7.04. Now, when I enable them, the windows lose their frames. I guess the window manager stops running or something.
[none]	[17:02]	<miir>	hehe green , then how do you know it sucks ^^
[none]	[17:02]	<Greencookie>	"all I see is big red letters that say ""OUT OF RANGE"""

[none]	[17:03]	<flagel>	I tried to install gobuntu but apparently the part of installing gobuntu-desktop was broken so then I installed the CLI-version and added gobuntu-desktop from there, however this changes the GRUB menu.lst to a quiet version which makes it impossible to type in the LUKS-password, I tried to change the menu.lst but it changes back after every update-grub, why?
[none]	[17:03]	<soctu>	I upgraded from fiesty and wow i'm really regretting it. i'm having the no borders problem and it takes an extra 20 seconds to load the os

[none]	[17:03]	<SNy>	Greencookie: Same here. The mga is bugged, apparently.

[none]	[17:03]	<miir>	noone here that knew anything about my partion question ? ^^
[none]	[17:03]	<Greencookie>	I guess GUTSY doesn't like my ATI card.

[none]	[17:04]	<sorsis>	ReL1K: great
[none]	[17:04]	<pike_>	Greencookie: that is monitor issue to fix 1) alt-ctrl-f2  2) sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  3) choose default for most stuff but under res only check what your monitor is capable of
[none]	[17:04]	<SNy>	genii: vga, haha. For 1680x1050?

[none]	[17:04]	<jxxt>	Greencookie, Linux does not like ati cards in general
[none]	[17:04]	<genii>	Greencookie: The install cd has that option on the menu before it starts to go to the default install
[none]	[17:04]	<stray77>	numus, id like to know that too!
[positive]	[17:04]	<gutsyAleExXxX>	beni_: I mean relative to everything else that is supposedly the same size font :)

[positive]	[17:06]	<jxxt>	gharz, This is a guess but I think that your graphics card is not up to the task.. Or Compiz thinks that at least :-9

[none]	[17:13]	<dn4>	msmitha, are you inside of a console?
[none]	[17:13]	<gharz>	jxxt, i noticed that it runs for at least 20 seconds and then goes back to it normal state
[none]	[17:13]	<TheRepacker>	gharz, check your xorg.conf, something is not enabled
[none]	[17:13]	<gordonjcp>	msmitha: if you know what you don't know, you know what to ask about
[positive]	[17:13]	<kdubois>	msmitha: welcome to the tribe then :-D
[positive]	[17:13]	<jxxt>	gharz, This is too clever for me I would search the card and see what results other than that i can be of no more help sorry:-((
[none]	[17:13]	<Black4lpha>	whats the terminal syntax to paste whatever i have copied into the folder im viewing(opt)
[none]	[17:13]	<gharz>	jxxt, ok thanks.

[none]	[17:13]	<joar>	Pirate_Hunter: sorry, you've gotta configure /etc/X11/xorg.conf by hand
[none]	[17:13]	<Geoffrey2>	if I need to post a kernel bug report, where in launchpad do I go?

[none]	[17:14]	<TheRepacker>	gharz,  what video card?
[none]	[17:14]	<Pici>	Black4lpha: Move or copy?
[none]	[17:14]	<Pirate_Hunter>	genii: will do so but i believed when you changed the resolution once you logged in it would affect the login screen as well which is what amazes me, why would it still be using default high resolution in the first place?
[none]	[17:14]	<gharz>	intel 82852/82855 GM/GME
[none]	[17:14]	<gharz>	something like that
[none]	[17:14]	<kl4m>	joar: What? isn't failsafe X the solution for this exact kind of problem?
[none]	[17:14]	<nrdb>	In what package is the man page for sprintf etc in ?

[none]	[17:15]	<nrdb>	Pici: I have that installed but I don't get the man pages coming up.
[none]	[17:15]	<joar>	kl4m: mabye I misunderstood, I thought he wanted to alter the resolution for he's login screen
[none]	[17:15]	<Pici>	Black4lpha: mv /path/to/file/old.txt /new/path/     (might need to prefix with sudo depending on the locations, also replace paths with the real paths)
[none]	[17:15]	<dn4>	what is the apt-get command to upgrade tehh system? sudo apt-get upgrade
[none]	[17:15]	<dn4>	?

[none]	[17:16]	<gharz>	TheRepacker, another question and i hope you can help me. our network has been modified for WPA-PSK TKIP... when the changed was implemented my machine became slow... when i open an apps, i normally get a 40 sec lag... apps don't open immediately.
[none]	[17:16]	<joar>	kl4m: gdm/kdm/xdm seem to default to the first resolution listed in xorg.conf (sometimes, not allways)
[none]	[17:16]	<Black4lpha>	ah got it, thx pici
[none]	[17:16]	<Pirate_Hunter>	joar: no you didnt i only need it for the login screen yeha i know wierd but thats the case
[none]	[17:16]	<kl4m>	joar: Oh. Then it's not broken. I don't know about that
[none]	[17:16]	<msmitha>	I am running 6.0 and would like to upgrade to 7.10 also I need to now the basics like installing new apps. burning CD ect...
[negative]	[17:16]	<genii>	Pirate_Hunter: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=209474   has an example of where it should go. As to why it does not draw it's resolution setting from window manager resolution setting, gdm and kdm have the equivelent of their own xinitrc files.
[none]	[17:16]	<jxxt>	dn4, go to update manager
[none]	[17:16]	<computerex>	Just use the update manager
[none]	[17:16]	<joar>	Pirate_Hunter: try 'sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf' scroll down to the line specifying modes for 24bit resolution, make sure the mode you want is listed first
[none]	[17:16]	<stepomaticc>	dn4: apt-get dist-upgrade

[none]	[17:19]	<Moduliz0r>	how do I tell apt-get that I dont have my CD ROM?
[none]	[17:19]	<computerex>	There is a gutsy torrent ...?

[none]	[17:20]	<arghh2d2>	drive worked fine a week ago numus
[none]	[17:20]	<JEFFmasterFlex>	Adylass: i think the new evolution depends on gnome 2.20 so you don't have much of a choice, i think. don't quote me on that one
[none]	[17:20]	<stefg>	Adylass, you can't just use the gutsy evolution in feisty, because it depends on gnome-libs. so you either upgradem wait for a backport (if it happens) or build it yourself
[none]	[17:20]	<msmitha>	Can any one please coach me on this OS cause even though I do really appriciate all the info. I am receving, its still Jibrish to me
[none]	[17:20]	<NotSure>	I would appreciate it if you could help me: right now as I type this message, the titlebars of programs opened in other workspaces flash on the taskbar of the current workspace. I would like to have this disabled. I use Gnome.

[none]	[17:21]	<numus>	kendrixski impossible to say.. since you have the repo ... you have torrents.. you have webdownloads from mirrors

[none]	[18:07]	<x938>	and have a dual boot linux system 7.10/7.04
[none]	[18:07]	<tovella>	Doitle: from what i recall, wireless is handled by network-manager, so if you have a wired connection active, a wireless one if tricky (and a security risk) to have connected, simultaineously.  there are ways to do it, but i don't recommend it for a new user.
[none]	[18:07]	<fr0nk>	WanderingKnight: none yet, just want to have the possibility since compiz isn't working in the most current version available (approx 10 fps) in my 7.04 install
[none]	[18:07]	<tovella>	Doitle: have you installed any firewall software, yet?
[none]	[18:07]	<fr0nk>	since 7.10 has compiz as default...

[none]	[18:09]	<PovAddict>	kiru: err
[none]	[18:09]	<kiru>	PovAddict: wich hammer is bigger than kill -9?
[none]	[18:09]	<PovAddict>	kiru: good question
[none]	[18:09]	<remix5x>	crap, i just changed a setting that disabled all the nifty window effects... when i enabled 3d cube it asked me to disable a plug in and when i said yes all the effects went away.... is there some sort of log that i can find to see what it was?
[positive]	[18:09]	<Dr_willis>	kiru,  that would be pulling the plug. :)
[none]	[18:09]	<nickrud>	kiru: killing the parent process
[none]	[18:10]	<PovAddict>	kiru: nitroglycerin?
[none]	[18:10]	<penguin42>	Does gutsy still use mpt drivers for LSI SCSI cards and if so does anyone know if they are on the x86 boot CDs ?
[none]	[18:10]	<navaburo>	So is it my connection or are the repos getting totally hammered?
[positive]	[18:10]	<kiru>	nickrud: already killed, next advice pls
[none]	[18:10]	<nickrud>	kiru: then el destructo, power
[positive]	[18:10]	<DARKGuy>	greedo, yeah, but in Gutsy they have included CompizFusion... you just install your video drivers and enable the desktop effects and it'll be working nice and dandy (hopefully... it did on my system anyways). There's fast user switching, better configuration dialogs/panels, a desktop search tool similar to google desktop search, but better and less bloated ;), and lots of other pretty stuff... a nice kernel too :)
[none]	[18:10]	<nickrud>	kiru: but try logging out first
[none]	[18:10]	<x938>	lavender dreams: you might also want to setup your default download options to save to a specific place auomatically without asking, then you can have autoplay and autodownload without asking

[none]	[19:30]	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : Well it should do it for you... and ask you before it does it. But yea, if you see the two screens in nvidia-settings then that means TwinView should be able to work if you turn it on

[none]	[19:31]	<PovAddict>	ubuntu: there is a limit of 4 partitions; making one of them extended lets you add 4 more, splitting one in four, let's say; if you dont plan on having more than 4 partitions, all as primary are fine

[none]	[19:31]	<rryan>	Sitting_Duck : And if the settings don't save, you probably need to hit the 'save to X configuration file', which will write it into your xorg.conf, but you need to have nvidia-settings running as root, so you need to run it by typing 'gksudo nvidia-settings'
[none]	[19:31]	<zerokill>	[chr0n0s]: ive got a 2 sata2 harddrive setup. hda had vista and hdb was supposed to be the ubuntu one. after i made the partitions in hdb i installed grub in the mbr of hda (hd0)

[none]	[20:05]	<mehdi2>	I've changed fonts hinting but didn't help much
[none]	[20:05]	<meta-paonia>	fjleon - resizing doesn't work in ntfs - you should backup the drive and reformat
[none]	[20:05]	<kd7swh>	fjleon: use partition magic in windows, or gparted in Ubuntu disk
[none]	[20:05]	<rryan>	fjleon : you can get it from the 'ntfsprogs' package

[none]	[20:06]	<rryan>	fjleon : you shoudl be able to. On the safety issue, I wouldn't do an ntfs resize on a partition I would die if I lost..  the software could have a problem with your specific setup, but I have done it and ti worked off a livecd

So that windows would start if I didn't have the disk in, but when I put it in and restarted it would give me a menu to select XP or linux.

[none]	[22:31]	<amt>	PriceChild, what client do you suggest, then?
[none]	[22:31]	<Stwange>	amt - you tried changing it in the settings?

[none]	[22:32]	<Stwange>	amt - it's only locked because you are connected to a server. If you disconnect from the server(s) (type /quit) it won't be greyed any more

[none]	[23:17]	<seamus7>	joanki: you ought to use a partition program and set up the partition for windows at the size you want ... the rest will be empty unpartitioned space awaiting your ubunut install ... when you install ubuntu you will use its partition guide to install into the empty space
[none]	[23:17]	<lomez>	Jordan_U yes, between two drives actually, im reformatting one of them

[none]	[23:18]	<Mr_Giraffe>	does anybody know how to set up an ftp server using proftpd?
[none]	[23:18]	<IpMoo>	Fiona:    what went wrong
[none]	[23:18]	<Mr_Giraffe>	i thought i had it working, but apparently pam is borked and hating me

[none]	[23:19]	<bobbo>	Mr_Giraffe: sudo apt-get install proftpd gproftpd, set it up using gproftpd in System menu
[none]	[23:19]	<Jordan_U>	msikma, Yes, but I just do a three finger tap
[none]	[23:19]	<lomez>	OiPenguin, have you looked at Ubuntu on Dell's?
[none]	[23:19]	<src>	Dumptruck, or if you have lots of stuff to do as root, do a sudo bash or sudo su -
[none]	[23:19]	<Dumptruck>	what is cp?
[none]	[23:19]	<Mr_Giraffe>	bobbo, i hate guis, but whatever
[none]	[23:19]	<Fiona>	Basically, I had issues with my monitor, but Gutsy managed to fix them, but then I found that the gamma settings were screwed, and xgamma didn't seem to do it right. So I installed the restricted driver for my ATi card. Then when I restarted, the keyboard setting reverted to QWERTY on login (I use Dvorak) and it wouldn't accept my usrename or password.
[none]	[23:19]	<lomez>	OiPenguin they are pretty decent prices, a bit cheaper than Windows, and theyre not bad
[none]	[23:19]	<Mr_Giraffe>	Dumptruck, cp = copy

[none]	[23:19]	<Dumptruck>	ah ha
[none]	[23:19]	<msikma>	Jordan_U: I'd personally prefer CTRL+Click since that's how I used to do that in Mac OS X
[none]	[23:19]	<Fiona>	I went to the recovery terminal and the user still exists
[none]	[23:19]	<Blama>	"Hey everybody, is there a reason why none of my settings in Ubuntu get saved? Nothing I do saves and I have to redo them when I reboot. I have an ATI x800 GT.

[none]	[23:20]	<bobbo>	Mr_Giraffe: what part are you needing help with?
[none]	[23:20]	<Mr_Giraffe>	i just don't know how do get it to work with pam
[none]	[23:20]	<src>	Dumptruck, get used to it.
[none]	[23:20]	<IpMoo>	Fiona:    thats sounds wierd.. was a clean install  of 7.10
[none]	[23:20]	<seamus7>	joanki: i don't think you understand ... windows will be in the ntfs files system while ubuntu will use the ext3 file system .... your hard drive will be partitioned (divided) into one area just for your windows operating system and all the files you have for it ... and the other partition/s will be just for your ubuntu operating system and all the files you use within it ...
[none]	[23:20]	<Jordan_U>	msikma, The problem is that ctrl click already means something in a lot of applications, usually to open something in a new tab ( like in Firefox )
[none]	[23:20]	<OiPenguin>	riotkittie: lomez: I'm in Norway. They don't sell version which comes with preinstalled Ubuntu in the us. May I assume that similar models will work?

[none]	[23:20]	<orb2>	yellow_chicken I had that problem and I left it for 15 minutes and it finished
[none]	[23:20]	<msikma>	I guess that could be used
[none]	[23:21]	<Jimdb>	joanki:  there are windows ext2/3 file system drivers and there are ntfs file system drivers for linux
[none]	[23:21]	<Fiona>	IpMoo: Yes, but I did a clean install anyway. I burned tho iso again, formatted the partition and reinstalled afresh

[none]	[23:21]	<msikma>	I love 7.10. Excellent software.
[none]	[23:21]	<joanki>	is that correct?
[none]	[23:21]	<flake>	does it take a long time for 7.10 amd64 bit to boot up, it stays on a black screen for a while, got impatient and turned it off
[none]	[23:21]	<Dumptruck>	in your example?
[none]	[23:21]	<Jordan_U>	msikma, That is the command key ( in mac terms ) / the super key ( in linux terms )
[none]	[23:21]	<K3nt>	msikma: I KNOW!
[none]	[23:21]	<joanki>	i would hate to do all the installations and find out i did it wrong

[none]	[23:21]	<src>	Dumptruck, not necessarily. for example cp /home/user/myfile.yxy /usr/local/bin will copy myfile.yxy to /usr/local/bin

[none]	[23:22]	<seamus7>	joanki: if you're starting from scratch then the first thing to do is create a partition of in your case 37GB into which you will install windows ... the rest of the hard drive is empty unpartitioned space until you install Ubuntu at which point you use its partitioning guide to use the unused space in which to install

[none]	[23:34]	<Flannel>	lavender_dream: They all deal with the same database, so they all work interchangably
[none]	[23:34]	<riotkittie>	lavender_dream: synaptic is merely a graphical front end for apt.

[none]	[23:36]	<lithium>	anyone know if there is a sure-fire way to check if a graphics card is dead, or just needs a bios flashed?
[none]	[23:36]	<Jordan_U>	unstable, You need to use the alternate CD for that
[none]	[23:36]	<kitche>	lavender_dream: I believe ubuntu disabled that feature since ubuntu uses a patched version of firefox their own version really
[none]	[23:36]	<Cable86>	Rob125: firefox 2.0.0.7 fixed a bug with quicktime, which Linux does not have...thus, updating it to 2.0.0.7 in linux would be pointless
[none]	[23:36]	<swedestralian>	i can not get my headphone jack to work,   can anybody help me?
[none]	[23:36]	<Flannel>	lavender_dream: Its because 2.0.0.6 is in the repositories.  Thats the version in ubuntu.  It'll get updated in a few days, if it hasnt been already.

[none]	[23:53]	<sulan>	this is under x86_64
[none]	[23:53]	<src>	Dumptruck, you can also change root (hd1,0) to rootnoverify hd(1,0)
[none]	[23:53]	<lucita>	but it was working under 7.04
[none]	[23:53]	<t|om>	Jordan_U: IK, I think the best way is reporting this to the Wiki author, thx
[none]	[23:53]	<Slart>	K3nt, Stormx2: I think ubuntu-effects has moved to #compiz-fusion.. there might be a redirect
[none]	[23:54]	<Dumptruck>	what what?
[none]	[23:54]	<Dumptruck>	I mean wait what
[none]	[23:54]	<fant>	jordan_u:  that just returns [1] 9616 in the shell but doesnt start it
[none]	[23:54]	<Dumptruck>	is that a needed change?  How do I write it?
[none]	[23:54]	<seamus7_>	lucita: maybe you need to enable certain option in order to adjust the volume .. sometimes they are turned down and must be manually increased
[none]	[23:54]	<src>	Dumptruck, try it like this and if it doesnt work we'll see... Just add the 2 lines I added
[none]	[23:55]	<quodlibetor>	anybody: my network manager is discovering my WPA network, asking me for a password, and then not logging in
[none]	[23:55]	<seamus7_>	lucita: sometimes a reboot works if it's just a one time fluke
[none]	[23:55]	<Dumptruck>	ok I'll be back in a moment
[none]	[23:55]	<pyrak>	is there a way i can do a restore install without losing my files?
[none]	[23:55]	<pyrak>	my edgy upgrade crashed 3/4 of the way through, and im afraid some things may not have installed right
[none]	[23:55]	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Make a backup of /home and reinstall.
[none]	[23:55]	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Ah, don't worry, that can be sorted out. Can you boot the system?
[none]	[23:55]	<Blama>	Ljl, Are you there?
[none]	[23:55]	<pyrak>	storm2, yeah, im on it now
[none]	[23:56]	<lucita>	<seamus7_> rebooted twice, the control volumen, the bars dont appear, looks like no card was recognised
[none]	[23:56]	<pyrak>	storm2, i meant gutsy upgrade, by the way
[positive]	[23:56]	<speaker219>	My 7.10 Gusty download is at 95% :p excited
[none]	[23:56]	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Well, you should be able to resume the upgrade.
[none]	[23:56]	<pyrak>	storm2, it says it's already upgraded
[none]	[23:56]	<pyrak>	storm2, and i seem to have most of the features
[positive]	[23:56]	<Stormx2>	pyrak: Well then, you'd better trust it :)
[none]	[23:56]	<Tchaka>	I am wondering if it's a good idea to update ubuntu 7.04 -> 7.10. Apparently there are still some bugs and several people have problems with this new version, no?
[none]	[23:56]	<bulmer>	quodlibetor: without the wpa, does it work?
[none]	[23:56]	<pyrak>	storm2, but when i boot up the screen is just brown
[none]	[23:56]	<fant>	Jordan_U: did you get that message ?
[none]	[23:56]	<quodlibetor>	bulmer. nope
[none]	[23:56]	<Shapeshifter>	I don't _really_ get the excitment about gutsy. I didn't notice anything significantly different until now...
[none]	[23:56]	<quodlibetor>	almost, once
[none]	[23:56]	<pyrak>	storm2, when it used to have the thing with the little icons and the bongoes playing
[none]	[23:56]	<Stormx2>	pyrak: To be sure, do this: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get --assume-yes dist-upgrade <--that will do any remaining upgrades
[none]	[23:57]	<quodlibetor>	bulmer, but then it stopped
[none]	[23:57]	<bulmer>	quodlibetor: then get the unencrypted version work first
[none]	[23:57]	<Slart>	Tchaka: if you don't need it right away I would wait a week or two.. let other people deal with the new problems.. update faqs etc etc
[none]	[23:57]	<pyrak>	storm2, ok i'll try, thanks
[none]	[23:57]	<LjL>	Blama: yes
[none]	[23:57]	<seamus7_>	lucita: so you've right clicked on the volume applet in the panel and chosen preferences ... palyed around with them .. the opened up volume control and made sure nothing was set to mute or turned down ... then tested other preferences ... ?

[none]	[23:58]	<quodlibetor>	bulmer: that makes so much sense i feel like i've tried it, i'll brb if it doesn't start working
[none]	[23:58]	<Tchaka>	Slart, I think I will wait for one month, and then maybe I will update
[none]	[23:58]	<codecaine>	anybody else suffering from slow internet connection on gusty?

[none]	[23:58]	<Tigerman>	i have a problem
[none]	[23:58]	<lavender_dream>	Stormx2: myself, sorry if I'm not following an obscure protocol with it...
[none]	[23:58]	<pyrak>	storm2, hm, it says i'm fine...
[none]	[23:58]	<LjL>	"Blama: no. because i asked for the output of       mount | grep ""on / ""          . there is a space after the slash and before the quotation mark."
[none]	[23:58]	<fant>	Anyone know how to make sure the nm-applet is starting with X ?
[none]	[23:58]	<Cable86>	codecaine: nope, my internet is fine
[none]	[23:58]	<pyrak>	storm2, how do you enable the neat cube thingey?
[none]	[23:58]	<pyrak>	"storm2, i still just have the ""desktop effects"" button"
[positive]	[23:58]	<Stormx2>	lavender_dream: not really that obscure. This channel moves fast. Please use /msg ubotu if the message is only for yourself, thanks :)
[none]	[23:58]	<lavender_dream>	Stormx2: thank you, will do that next time.
[none]	[23:59]	<Tigerman>	i have lost my Restart and Shutdown buttons... how can i enable them?

[none]	[23:59]	<myusrnm>	my computer needs libmp3lame.so to run a program, what is this / where do i find it ?
[none]	[23:59]	<seamus7_>	lucita: notice in Volume Control under File .. there is the option to change the device ..
[none]	[23:59]	<Slart>	Tchaka: sounds like a good plan.. as you said, there seems to be some problems.. but I'm sure they'll be sorted out in due time
[none]	[23:59]	<Blama>	LjL, this is hard because I have to boot out of windows and into Ubuntu, change the settings and then do it.. and I cant stay in it because I cant get internet on Ubuntu yet...
[none]	[23:59]	<lucita>	<seamus> i go to System>preference>sounds and then the tab called Devices is empty

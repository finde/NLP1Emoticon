12:01	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: its because a friend tryed your config with /home and it worked for him

12:01	<SnakePliske1>	tusk, ive never cared for the nvidia drivers
12:01	<dcomsa>	Ranbee: pm
12:01	<ross>	Hey, I just installed feisty.  The network manager app worked fine to start with, but I needed to check something with ifconfig.  After using ifconfig, the network manager doesn't work correctly( ie. no info on active connection )
12:01	<Tusk>	SnakePliske1, join the club...unfortunately what can I do?
12:01	<JoseStefan>	mwe, no just one 1.5gb (aprox)
12:01	<gabriela>	espaol
12:02	<ross>	are there any records of this before?
12:02	<SnakePliske1>	uninstall?
12:02	<Glos_WiFi>	hi, does anyone know how to load up the boot log? i saw a Bios Bug error message, but it then continued to load
12:02	<mwe>	JoseStefan: what makes you think it's activated twice?
12:02	<Tusk>	SnakePliske1, and do what? use no 3d?
12:02	<JoseStefan>	mwe, swapon -s
12:02	<gabriela>	what is the server in spanish
12:02	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, Sorry I was disconnected.
12:02	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: ok, i get a message saying "mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda4, missing codepage or other error", then "type control-D to continue"
12:02	<mwe>	JoseStefan: shows what, exactly?
12:02	<nexact>	hello all, is it possible to enable XDMCP via ssh ? thanks.
12:02	<SnakePliske1>	i dont use proprietary crap on linux....defeats the whole purpose
12:02	<cedricshock>	Glos_WiFi, bios messages you can't see, but everythin after linux starts can be viewed with the dmesg command.
12:02	<JoseStefan>	mwe, please hold...
12:02	<Fringe4>	My video is stuck in 800x600 mode, and I can't update the video driver. It keeps saying there is an apt based error and then stopping.
12:02	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, How did you say to connect using cmd?
12:03	<AATDark>	Blubloblu and what happens if you try CNRL D ?
12:03	<Tusk>	SnakePliske1, I understand that, but I want to have 3d support, so what options do I have beyond the Nvidia drivers?
12:03	<Glos_WiFi>	cedricshock: no its not a bios message, its a message that shows when linux starts, so il have a loog at dmesg then
12:03	<darwin>	Can someone recommend a good, affordable printing for basic black and white document printing?
12:03	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock net use * \\ip\music\
12:03	<Blubloblu>	it appears to load something, but screen goes black after
12:03	<dcomsa>	shakya: how are you trying to install java?
12:03	<SnakePliske1>	that is your option
12:03	<cedricshock>	Glos_WiFi: "dmesg | less" makes it a lot more readable.
12:03	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, Type it exactly like that?
12:03	<JoseStefan>	mwe, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16666/
12:03	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: it appears to load something, but screen goes black after
12:04	<Tusk>	SnakePliske1, lol, that's not a very good option...but ok
12:04	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock yeah * is to assing a free drive letter
12:04	<JoseStefan>	mwe, free and top report: "Swap:      2939872"
12:04	<exs>	I've heard feisty still does *not* have support for the bcm wifi cards... and nor does it have ndiswrapper included??.. BCM cards are the ones all macs have,  - that's a massive market.
12:04	<Glos_WiFi>	k thanks
12:04	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: is this your root device ? sd4 ?
12:04	<gabriela>	need help
12:04	<Blubloblu>	no
12:04	<ohgood>	does ubuntu not support ppc ?
12:04	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: sd2 is
12:04	<PriceChild>	!ppc | ohgood
12:04	<ubotu>	ohgood: PowerPC.  Formerly used by Apple for the Macintosh line of computers. Variants are now used in popular gaming consoles. PPC was a fully supported Ubuntu architecture up to and including edgy. It is now a community port, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ
12:04	<mwe>	JoseStefan: hmm. check /etc/fstab. It sounds odd
12:04	<AATDark>	Blubloblu and what is sd4 ?
12:04	<dcomsa>	gabriela: with what?
12:05	<Ranbee>	dcomsa: i found the checksum here - http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/7.04/ thanks
12:05	<JoseStefan>	mwe, my fstab is on the pastebin too
12:05	<tom_>	#ubuntu-effects
12:05	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: i've been having problems with sd4 though, i mounted my /home directory on it, then i took it off. It's now empty
12:05	<ohgood>	PriceChild, thanks, I appreciate that.
12:05	<dcomsa>	Ranbee: glad to hear :)

12:06	<gabriela>	i just can enter as  root mode

12:06	<costas>	tabs mainly
12:06	<zilly6_>	how do i stop sound juicer from popping up on disc entry?
12:06	<dcomsa>	gabriela: yes. why do you need to enter as root?
12:06	<costas>	eck: tabs mainly
12:06	<ohgood>	cool, I'm downloading the ppc iso now. thanks folks.
12:07	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: That log is odd - you can see it spitting the 1680 mode out but not explicitly the 1900
12:07	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: probalby a connection issue ?
12:07	<costas>	eck: but anything else would be a benefit over xterm which has nothing at all really
12:07	<gabriela>	4dcomsa: i can not see my desktop
12:07	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: However the fact that one gets spat out because of max dot clock is interesting
12:07	<eck>	costas: use gnome-terminal
12:07	<JoseStefan>	mwe, doing swapoff -a, followed by swapon -a, fixes the problem until reboot
12:07	<cedricshock>	costas? What do you mean by tabs? Tab completion?
12:07	<gabriela>	is there a problem with the x sever
12:07	<LsBlend>	can anybody help me with a problem i have on installing ubuntu 7.04?
12:07	<dcomsa>	costas: press crtl+shift+t for a new tab

12:07	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: prabply taking a boot cd an trying chkfs ?
12:07	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: or is it fschk ?
12:07	<costas>	eck: I am not able to use that due to a bug with NVIDIA drivers and the xinerama option
12:07	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv, AATDark: Do you have gnome on your ubuntu computer?
12:08	<Ranbee>	zilly6_: i don't use ubuntu i'm about to try it but it should be in gconf-editor
12:08	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, Yeah.

12:08	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock i have  but currently im unter windows

12:08	<eck>	costas: that is unfortunate. I believe eterm has tabs and also has 256 color support
12:08	<Tusk>	can someone at least tell me what usually causes the crazy lines to be displayed when I do "startx"?
12:08	<fiction>	what's the command line for metacity?
12:08	<costas>	cedricshock: yes tab completion, and all the other useful niceties that gnome-terminal brings -- but an alternative
12:08	<zilly6_>	tx ranbee
12:08	<gabriela>	i have  aproblem with the x server i can not see my desktop
12:08	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: try the command : telnet ip 445 on windows
12:08	<penguin42>	shakya: That's the last error - whats the error before that
12:08	<fiction>	is it just "metacity" ?
12:08	<costas>	eck: thanks thats great help
12:08	<eck>	costas: fiction yes
12:08	<gabriela>	i think that my video card is not being detected
12:08	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv, AATDark: Have you tried getting into the share from gnome?
12:08	<shakya>	hold on
12:08	<fiction>	eck: thanks
12:08	<lgc>	!pastebin
12:08	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
12:08	<eck>	sorry, that was to fiction
12:09	<Korgmatose>	what version of ipw3945 is feisty bundled with? can I check that?
12:09	<AATDark>	Blubloblu do you have a bootable linux cd?
12:09	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: insret it and try to check the filesystem on sd4
12:09	<Blubloblu>	yeah, i have the Desktop Feisty
12:09	<cedricshock>	costas: Tab completion comes from the shell (such as bash), not the terminal.
12:09	<eck>	costas: you can also use screen which is in some sense better than tabs, but also a bit more complicated to use
12:09	<Xy0n>	okay, where do i run the chroot command from?
12:09	<Xy0n>	grub?
12:09	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: it does say 1920 is not valid, but the too big part is maybe cuz this panel doesnt have that res in its list dunno
12:09	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: ok
12:09	<TashKavarish>	the clock part is something i noticed
12:09	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, "Connecting to ip... Could not open connection to host, on port 445: Connect failed"

12:10	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: ok this is the problem
12:10	<costas>	eck: I used screen but like u say a bit complex for now
12:10	<tom_>	LjL, how do I assoicate wmv with vlc instead of totem?
12:10	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: You could try explicitly adding a modeline
12:10	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: this must work if the samba server is up
12:10	<TashKavarish>	ddcprobe lists 1920 but not 1650 so the too big probably = not supported
12:10	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: i tried it no diff
12:10	<JoseStefan>	mwe, i think this is is related (reading)   bug 96715
12:10	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: a friend testet it and it worked
12:10	<gabriela>	what command do i need to run to install my ati 9250 video card
12:10	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: check your samba bind ip

12:10	<kourabies>	can anyone pleaas help with 7.04???
12:10	<costas>	bye for now
12:10	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv, AATDark: He doesn't have one, so it should be binding to all interfaces.
12:11	<Kamaria>	Hey guys, I got a problem. I installed, formatted, partitioned, and mounted a hard drive. How do I change the permissions of a mounted device? I can access it as root, but I want to be able to change it in my normal user account. When I try to change permissions in nautilus as root it keeps changing back on me. Is there a way to do this properly from the terminal?
12:11	<tom_>	GeekChick|, I can only click play and then it tries to open with totem
12:11	<dcomsa>	gabriela: how exactly works your system? can you boot in to it?
12:11	<tom_>	GeekChick|, there is no open with option :(

12:12	<Jordan_U>	The_Un-Named, Have you done a checksum?
12:12	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, Should I change the interface under the networking section of samba?
12:12	<costas>	kourabies: distantly related yes
12:12	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Ah interesting!
12:12	<gabriela>	4dcomsa: yes but only with the root mode, i mean no video just comands lines i think that my video card is not being detected
=== Solidus is now known as LiquidSnake
12:12	<cedricshock>	Kamaria: If it's a windows drive or drive without permissions in the filesystem, they are set at mount time. You can change them by changing /etc/fstab umask, uuid, or guid options.
12:12	<sanzky>	hi everyone, does anyone knows if feisty has problems with the bcm43xx driver?
12:12	<GeekChick|>	What is the apt-get command for installing java? i did "sudo apt-get install java" and it has nothing, so i typed the same and used tab complete on java and there are 15 different packages. which one do you install?
12:12	<yoni>	Hi all
12:12	<ataylor>	hi. roughly how much space is required for the upgrade to 7.04?
12:12	<Blubloblu>	The_Un-Named: does your disc just contain the .iso file or does it have all the filesystem folders?
12:12	<The_Un-Named>	yes, only one file didn't match, but I've tryed 3 differet iso's
12:12	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: In your log I think it is suggesting it is using single link DVI and the DVI is what is limiting the dot rate to 155MPixel
12:12	<dcomsa>	gabriela: which version did you installed?
12:12	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: try to enter on your samba maschine telnet 127.0.0.1 445

12:14	<dcomsa>	gabriela: oh ok, but what does it tell you? why can't it start the GUI?
12:14	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: By dual link I don't mean two connectors - just two digital links in the one DVI connector
12:14	<TashKavarish>	this one is a single link display probably why it uses 58hz instead of 60 since 60 means its too near the max 165 clock

12:28	<Jordan_U>	JR, Worked for me with the restricted driver manager
12:29	<cedricshock>	Kamaria: Not sure about a desktop icon for it. Someone else might know the right way, I usually just make symlinks to stuff like that.

12:31	<miranda82>	dcomsa, sure

12:33	<lmosher>	Jordan_U, Thanks, sorry I didn't see the link on ubuntu.com for that :/
12:33	<Pelo>	cblack0,  you don'T need to upgrade from beta to stable,  it will update automaticaly , if it hasn't already
12:33	<GeekChick|>	AATDark, fsck always complains about ext3 being "mounted too many times" without a check.
12:33	<Notchnick>	Jordan_U how do I do that

12:34	<sacater>	59
12:34	<patrick_>	miranda82, was your sound problem sorted out???
12:34	<robbie_crash>	Since upgrading to feisty, I am missing a harddrive.
12:34	<maccam94>	Vessquire, a lot can change in a year, so it's possible. dunno personallly though :-\
12:34	<AATDark>	GeekChick| what is th eproblem ?
12:34	<miranda82>	patrick_, nope :S
12:34	<AATDark>	GeekChick can you mount your drive ?
12:34	<GeekChick|>	AATDark, none, just saying.
12:34	<cedricshock>	Anyone have any idea how many days of "Setting up ..." I'm in for?
12:34	<maccam94>	fonz_, the ubuntu servers have been overloaded since the release of feisty, so that may be the issue you're having
12:34	<cotton>	Are there any financial benefits to mirroring Ubuntu?
12:34	<robbie_crash>	won't mount, and hardware info crashes on load
12:35	<dcomsa>	miranda82: realtek is the chip
12:35	<belux>	does anyone have Supergrub link that is working?????
12:35	<fonz_>	maccam94: i get an error with universe...but i can download packages.gz by hand fine

12:35	<cotton>	Considering that it takes up nearly an entire server
12:35	<belux>	does anyone have Supergrub link that is working?????
12:35	<dcomsa>	miranda82: i think there are some issues with that card
12:35	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: and did fsck return any error?
12:35	<Pelo>	cotton,  ubuntu is free, where do you expect the money to pay for mirror to come from ?
12:35	<Zues_62>	does anyone know much bout xorg.conf
12:35	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: so far the modeline from the 'list of common modelines' is identical to the one ive already tried
12:35	<dcomsa>	try googleing for "ubuntu no sound nVidia Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio"
12:35	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: no
12:36	<maccam94>	fonz_, it might be timing out for apt (there may be a set time apt waits which is different than wget/a browser)
12:36	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: want me to put xorg.conf in pastebin so maybe you could see whats wrong?
12:36	<tesuki>	why can't i boot any more!
12:36	<aoirthoir>	i need to read the gnome settings files to see which programs i had isntalled in the panels..anyone know how I do that?
12:36	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Yes go on
12:36	<maccam94>	dcomsa, who has the nvidia mcp51?
12:36	<cedricshock>	cotton: In a big organization it can make managing upgrades much faster, it can let you control which packages are available inside the organization, and add packages available organization wide easily. Not much benefit unless you get pretty big.
12:36	<dcomsa>	miranda82: and see what other people with your card are saying
12:36	<Zues_62>	does anybody know about XORG.Conf file YES OR NO???
12:36	<dcomsa>	maccam94: miranda82
12:36	<Enselic_>	Where's the place to configure allowing the X server to accept TCP connections?
12:36	<maccam94>	miranda82, i've got an nvidia 680i mobo that has that card i believe
12:36	<fonz_>	Zues_62: yes
12:36	<patrick_>	dcomsa, miranda82,  it seems any card with intel hd audio does not seem to work in feisty, strangely it works in Debian Etch
12:36	<Pelo>	Zues_62,  I know a bit about it ,  what do youwant to know ?
12:36	<Jordan_U>	!anybody | Zues_62
12:36	<ubotu>	Zues_62: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
12:37	<cotton>	Can I see the 7.04 changelog?
12:37	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i haven't found anything for feisty... only posts that say that it works under edgy perfectly, (solution: upgrade from dapper to edgy)
12:37	<maccam94>	patrick_, i'm using feisty/intel hda...
12:37	<fiction>	!beryl
12:37	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: was fsck realy checking your hdd or did it just complete imedietly

12:38	<dcomsa>	miranda82: what is exactly the error
12:38	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: that mount worked
12:38	<Jordan_U>	robbie_crash, Does it show up in sudo fdisk -l?
12:38	<backz>	do you prefer mongrel than fastcgi to deploy ?
12:38	<szenti>	hi
12:38	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: its about 10 gigs
12:38	<patrick_>	dcomsa, maccam94, must have been fixed for the final release.. Im currently downloading the amd64 feisty

12:40	<Jordan_U>	cac_, System ->	Administration ->	Printing
12:40	<maccam94>	cac_, usually you go into system ->	administration ->	printing ->	add new printer
12:40	<robbie_crash>	Jordan_U: Nope.
12:40	<spar-due>	 I'm not able to bridge my network connections with vmware or virtualbox...any reason why i can't with the latest kernel and feisty?
12:40	<AATDark>	Blubloblu :cu
12:40	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Didn't your monitor have a max of 155MHz though?  Thing is that line is only about 48Hz
12:40	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Sorry, I was muted.
12:40	<patrick_>	maccam94, well is that easily solved
12:40	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: gute NAcht
12:40	<tesuki>	Orfeous, yes i did
12:40	<cac_>	I know how to go to the printer

12:40	<dcomsa>	miranda82: can u run lsmod | grep snd
12:40	<AATDark>	LaszloKv: i'm levaing .. cedricshock will get it
12:40	<Orfeous>	tesuki, ok, i dont not got any answers
12:40	<jpsamara>	How do I set up pdnsd (or dnsmasq) under Feisty? I don't want to mess with network manager
12:40	<cac_>	the problem is that I can't find the printer driver for my lexmark x1185
12:41	<crazy_penguin>	how do i set up cupsd to add a printer. i can't pass the athentication part in the browser. i used lppasswd to make new passwords but nevertheless i can't authenticate myself to the cupsd daemon. how can i fix this?
12:41	<Orfeous>	tesuki, ops..
12:41	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Thanks AATDark.
12:41	<fonz_>	maccam94: i seem to fix the error by switching it from http ->	ftp
12:41	<Orfeous>	tesuki, wrong of me.. i did ;)
12:41	<ryanakca>	someone pinged?
12:41	<TashKavarish>	the xorg log says the nvidia card has max 155, not sure if its even related
12:41	<Orfeous>	sorry
12:41	<AATDark>	LaszloKv: my last word ..telnet 127.0.0.1 445 on linux or netstat -planto
12:41	<Jordan_U>	spar-due, Yes, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware
12:41	<miranda82>	dcomsa, no output, when i try: modprobe snd_hda_intel it says module not found
12:41	<Pelo>	robbie_crash,   in gparted the HDDs appear in the drop down list to the right of the tool bar,  don''T expect to see your hdd in the partition windows,  try that first,  also try unplugging the working hdd and booting the live cd , see if gparted in there see it, considere hardware damange, nicked cables or even broken hdd
12:41	<fonz_>	maccam94: is there any disadvantage to ftp?
12:41	<tesuki>	Orfeous, haha.
12:41	<Doctor_Nick>	torrent.ubuntu.com is down, is there anywhere else to get the torrents for the fiesty dvds?
12:41	<maccam94>	patrick_, try opening up a terminal, doing sudo -i, and doing modprobe snd-intel-hda. then check the end of dmesg to see if it says anything
12:41	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: You want to see the results of both?
12:41	<patrick_>	maccam94, oh and previously when running feisty beta about 1 week ago, when I choose Log Out it just hung the whole system until I powered it down by holding down the power button
12:41	<amphacid>	hi there
12:41	<maccam94>	fonz_, nope, just different (and occasionally it's a little slower)
12:41	<TashKavarish>	honestly its like the nvidia driver disables anything over 1600x1200
12:41	<maccam94>	patrick_, well there's a reason it's called beta ;-)
12:41	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv: sure
12:42	<dcomsa>	miranda82: use pastebin and put there the output of dmsg
12:42	<tesuki>	Orfeous, what kind of problem did you have? was it the same as me?
12:42	<Pelo>	Doctor_Nick,  I can dcc you the  feisty 386 dvd torrent if you want it
12:42	<patrick_>	maccam94, do you think it may have been fixed
12:42	<TashKavarish>	is there any tool i could use to see what edid info my monitor reports?
12:42	<spar-due>	Jordan_U thanks!! I'll look through that..i really appreciate your help!
12:42	<miranda82>	dcomsa, nothing about sound..
12:42	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, Ubuntu.com isn't down for me...
12:42	<Doctor_Nick>	Pelo: do you have the kubuntu dvd?
12:42	<Doctor_Nick>	jordon: just the torrent.ubuntu.com
12:42	<maccam94>	Pelo, what's on the feisty dvd? just packages? or does it do lvm, and other stuff?
12:42	<Pelo>	Doctor_Nick,  no sorry,  ubuntu , not kubu
12:42	<dcomsa>	miranda82: is your sound card enabled from bios? :)
12:42	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i'll make the whole dmesg
12:42	<fonz_>	maccam94: k, thx
12:42	<Skyhook>	does 7.04 have ntfs support?
12:42	<maccam94>	patrick_, probably
12:42	<miranda82>	dcomsa, yes it is
12:42	<maccam94>	fonz_, np
12:42	<jpsamara>	How do I set up pdnsd (or dnsmasq) under Feisty? I don't want to mess with network manager
12:42	<dcomsa>	miranda82: sorry, i had to ask
12:42	<maccam94>	Skyhook, yes, but you have to install it yourself
12:43	<Doctor_Nick>	Pelo: no thx
12:43	<eck>	does the live cd not do lvm?
12:43	<miranda82>	dcomsa, actually, i'v ejust noticed, that if i open a gnome-terminal, and press down key, it sounds
12:43	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Telnet connects to 127.0.0.1
12:43	<BarronVon>	how do you check your kernal version?
12:43	<Pelo>	maccam94,  no idea,  I just ran out of cds so I'm doing the dvd,  I know I will be able to add most of my packages from it tho, but my sys isnT' very fancy
12:43	<madman91>	I am having a problem with my mouse... after upgrade to feisty .. my mouse wheel started acting funky,, meaning it didnt work at all.. so after a few days of following failed guides on google and on ubuntuforums.org .. i decided to come here and beg for mercy from the mouse gods
12:43	<brenix>	uname
12:43	<BarronVon>	kernel I mean
12:43	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, http://bw.releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
12:43	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Do you want to see a pastebin of netstat?
12:43	<maccam94>	Skyhook, it's actually just hit digg today. i'll get you the link to the howto
12:43	<brenix>	Barronvon: uname
12:43	<maccam94>	Pelo, you can just burn the cd iso to a dvd you know ;-)
12:43	<dcomsa>	miranda82: try aplay <some_file>
12:43	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv: To the port AATdark was suggesting (400 something)?
12:43	<Skyhook>	oh cool
12:43	<robbie_crash>	Pelo, It was working until I rebooted after upgrading
12:43	<aoirthoir>	ok bbl
12:43	<Orfeous>	tesuki, my problem is that i cant mount my second SATA-disk with an ntfs partition, but i can mount my ATA-disk with an ntfs partition.
12:43	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, I don't think there is a torrents.ubuntu.com to be down :)
12:43	<patrick_>	maccam94, that can be done
12:44	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Yeah, to 445
12:44	<Orfeous>	tesuki, i can also mount both ntfs partition if i boot with live-dvd
12:44	<Pelo>	maccam94,  can I ?  wow,  I just like the dvd anyway,  saves me some bandwith later on
12:44	<miranda82>	dcomsa, lots of alsa error and final line: no such device

12:44	<Tex_Arcana_>	Is there any fixes or tests to see why certain programs freeze up Feisty? I did a update manager already or do I need to go through every progam and if it freezes reboot uninstall and reinstall?
12:44	<dcomsa>	miranda82: ok ... so there's nothing in dmesg regarding the sound?
12:45	<Pelo>	robbie_crash,  I'm stumped
12:45	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Nah I don't know clone stuff
12:45	<robbie_crash>	Is there a way to downgrade back to 6.1?

12:45	<belux>	how can I burn a cdrom from iso.gz file?
12:45	<LaszloKv>	cedricshock: Should pastebin the results on netstat -planto?
12:45	<dcomsa>	maccam94: do tou have snd_hda_intel on a laptop?
12:45	<dcomsa>	miranda82: ok
12:45	<jrib>	robbie_crash: only by reinstalling
12:45	<maccam94>	robbie_crash, it's very not recommended
12:45	<ChrisF->	greetings.  Installed 7.04 and now I'm having a weird firefox problem.  Every time I load it, I get the screen saying, "Firefox - Restore Previous Session"  If I choose start new session, close and restart, I get that same box every time.  If I say Restore, same thing.  I can't get rid of it!  Any suggestions?
12:45	<Shaddox>	Hi everyone. I need Java 1.5 for a game, where can I get it for Ubuntu feisty 20070414 Dailybuild? Feisty ubuntu dvd isn't being seeded, so I haven't been able to upgrade.
12:45	<robbie_crash>	I wouldn't know, I've got no ntfs drives
12:45	<Orfeous>	my stopped working when i upgraded some packages and kernel
12:45	<miranda82>	dcomsa, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16679/
12:45	<crazy_penguin>	how do i set up cupsd to add a printer. i can't pass the athentication part in the browser. i used lppasswd to make new passwords but nevertheless i can't authenticate myself to the cupsd daemon. how can i fix this? any ideea? anyone?
12:45	<TashKavarish>	guess only thing i havent tried is scrapping the entire xorg.conf and start fresh
12:45	<maccam94>	dcomsa, ah i might know your problem. i'm not on a laptop, but there's a special line to pass to make it use different modes
12:45	<Skyhook>	thanks, maccam94

12:46	<Skyhook>	thanks, maccam94
12:46	<robbie_crash>	bollocks, my keyboard doesn't work properly either, yay for progress :(
12:46	<belux>	!iso.gz
12:46	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about iso.gz - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
12:46	<eck>	Shaddox: you can get it with apt (and upgrade to the latest release without downloading a new cd)
12:46	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, http://bw.releases.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/7.04/
12:46	<Pelo>	belux,   I think you need to unpack from gz first and then burn the iso  ( who is the idiot who make a that )
12:46	<jrib>	Valstorm2379: what are you trying to do?
12:46	<ResPiDeR>	when I active "desktop effects" the titlebar on every window disappear and gnome-terminal goes blank... whats that? Its feisty fawn fresh installation
12:46	<eck>	!java >	Shaddox
12:46	<dcomsa>	maccam94: i don't really have a pb (i think)
12:46	<Valstorm2379>	I'm trying to get a bin file to extract onto a floppy disk
12:46	<patrick_>	belux, can you not just extract it?
12:46	<maccam94>	Skyhook, no prob
12:46	<Valstorm2379>	Through ubuntu!
12:46	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: btw would you happen to know how to fix 2 network cards that randomly swap their ip configs?
12:46	<cedricshock>	Is there any way to get overall apt-get progress, via kill or some such?
12:46	<dcomsa>	maccam94: it's just that in edgy and dapper the headphones didn't worked by default
12:46	<Doctor_Nick>	jordan_U: rather, the DVD kubuntu feisty
12:46	<Valstorm2379>	Normally this file would extract by using windows.
12:46	<maccam94>	dcomsa, oh whoops mixed you up with miranda82
12:47	<Orfeous>	have anyone here read my problem and migjt got an solution for that or should i wait a little bit more?
12:47	<Valstorm2379>	I'm trying to make a BOOTDISK that's the thing.
12:47	<miranda82>	maccam94, ?
12:47	<dcomsa>	maccam94: cool. do you have a solution?
12:47	<Orfeous>	might*
12:47	<maccam94>	dcomsa, bah, gotta go to supper >_<
12:47	<trevor_>	hello
12:47	<maccam94>	i'll be on in 30 min if you guys aren't set by then
12:47	<dcomsa>	maccam94: damn
12:47	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Are they both DHCPing? Do the two cards swap around which one is eth0 ?
12:47	<jrib>	Valstorm2379: I see, no idea what "extacting a bin" means
12:47	<soothsay>	Is there a way to more forcefully ask a system to shutdown than 'shutdown -h'?
12:47	<Pelo>	hello trevor_  welcome to the assilum
12:47	<belux>	patrick_: I never burn a cd in ubuntu, can u tell me? extract the file I know
12:47	<Ice_Wewe>	PC World is suggesting 7 things to do after you install 7.04. Now, I'm not running 7.04, nor do I plan to in the near future, but tip #3 is to install AutoMatix. I was under the impression that AutoMatix was not the best thing under the sun
12:47	<soothsay>	Or reboot
12:47	<Valstorm2379>	okay I'll phrase it again
12:47	<madman91>	belux: you want to burn a cd ?
12:47	<TashKavarish>	dont have a eth0 actually, have eth1 and eth2
12:47	<cedricshock>	soothsay: The power supply?
12:48	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors
12:48	<maccam94-food>	soothsay, alt+prntscrn+s, then alt+prntscrn+o
12:48	<TashKavarish>	both fixed ips
12:48	<soothsay>	cedricshock: A little nicer than that
12:48	<Sniper00X>	just updated to Fiesty and upon rebooting it gets stuck at loading "console and font map" and does not get any further
12:48	<soothsay>	maccam94-food: No keyboard
12:48	<patrick_>	belux, you just right click the file and "Write to CD"
12:48	<trevor_>	does anyone have experience with ubuntu as a lamp server?
12:48	<TashKavarish>	1 is nic2nic gigabit to my 2nd pc, the other is to my net router
12:48	<Sniper00X>	any idea why it would do that and how to fix it?
12:48	<jrib>	!anyone | trevor_
12:48	<ubotu>	trevor_: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
12:48	<eck>	Ice_Wewe: I would not use it, especially since the restricted drivers manager does a lot of the things that automatix does
12:48	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Is it that eth1 and eth2 keep swapping arounbd which card they are or is it that the IP each one gets is different?
12:48	<belux>	patrick_: a ISO file?
12:48	<miranda82>	dcomsa, checked it?
12:48	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Yeah, it can be wuite pleasant.
12:48	<patrick_>	belux,  yes
12:48	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Yeah, it can be quite pleasant.
12:48	<Pelo>	Ice_Wewe, automatix is not supported here, and not well liked,   beside you can insall what you get from it easily enough your self and learn smething in the process
12:48	<jdsbluedevl>	hi, I'm having a serious problem.  When trying to update initram-fs, I get this error message: "/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf defines no arrays."
12:48	<Ice_Wewe>	eck: ok, because I've heard opposition to it before in this room, and I was wondering if the situation had changed at all
12:48	<Wymark>	OK, Can someone help me with installing Ubuntu on my XP. I want Ubuntu on a seperate HD than my XP and to be able to switch between them at start-up, but I am somewhat close to clueless on how to do this. Any help would be vfery..very appreciated.
12:48	<ResPiDeR>	when I active "desktop effects" the titlebar on every window disappear and gnome-terminal goes blank... whats that? Its feisty fawn fresh installation
12:48	<belux>	patrick_: nice, I'll try
12:48	<dcomsa>	miranda82: i'm reading it now
12:49	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: Do you have a RAID?
12:49	<patrick_>	belux, no probs
12:49	<jdsbluedevl>	I don't know what that is
12:49	<Shaddox>	 Thanks. Also, to whoever said i could upgrade without CD: I want to do a format. I was really only testing Feisty, and want to do a clean install with the actual release, so I don't install stuff I won't have again.
12:49	<trevor_>	cedric , i want to set up a lamp server, but want the gnome desktop - is this easy/plausible?
12:49	<Doctor_Nick>	look
12:49	<Ice_Wewe>	Pelo: I know, I use apt-get, and yum (on Fedora Core machines) whenever I install something, although I use synaptic for package searching
12:49	<DiceyDays>	Hey everyone. I am about to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy because of some repository/python problems. Were the problems people were having was because they upgraded the 'unofficial' way as opposed to (sudo update-manager -c)?
12:49	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: nic1 and nic2 swap which is detected as which, sometimes nic1=eth1 and nic2=eth2 others its the opposite, when theyre opposite the ip configs remain same so things no longer work
12:49	<Doctor_Nick>	the reason #1 you shouldn't install Automatix is because it will probably mess up your next distro upgrade
12:49	<fiction>	Wymark: burn the ubuntu ISO, and load on your computer. restart your computer but boot from the CD rom drive, and select"install ubuntu"
12:49	<Ice_Wewe>	Pelo: I was just wondering anyway, the next system I'm running on this computer is FC7
12:49	<Jordan_U>	Wymark, That is very easy, just download burn and boot the Ubuntu CD, it will ask you what drive you want to install on
12:49	<Doctor_Nick>	that should be reason enough
12:49	<Ice_Wewe>	Pelo: (when it gets released)
12:49	<jdsbluedevl>	all I know is that afterwards, I get this message: "W: udev hook script requires at least kernel version 2.6.17 | W: not generating requested initramfs for kernel 2.6.15-20-386
12:49	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Yeah, both will suffer from being overloaded, but it's easy and plausible. What's the P in your LAMP?
12:49	<jdsbluedevl>	"
12:50	<neoncode>	Whenver I try to run KVM it core dumps and crashes. Can anyone help me?
12:50	<trevor_>	php
12:50	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Ah OK, that's easy to fix
=== maarten_ is now known as tedb
12:50	<SaveFerris>	How can I disable a sound driver (emu10k1) with grub? because xubuntu (feisty) hands on startup.
12:50	<kitche>	ResPiDeR: your window manager is not starting like it's suppose
12:50	<TashKavarish>	really? how please
12:50	<SaveFerris>	hangs*
12:50	<Ice_Wewe>	anyway, good day!
12:50	<Sniper00X>	just updated to Fiesty and upon rebooting it gets stuck at loading "console and font map" and does not get any further
12:50	<Sniper00X>	any idea why it would do that and how to fix it?
12:50	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Try   man iftab
12:50	<eck>	SaveFerris: add it to the modprobe blacklist
12:50	<ResPiDeR>	kitche what do you mean? gnome is ok... gdm too... I installed nvidia drivers and they are ok too
12:50	<trevor_>	is it possible to set up ubuntu desktop as a lamp server :s?
12:50	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Since you want gnome, the easiest thing to do is install the desktop first, and then toss on server packages.
12:51	<dcomsa>	miranda82: asus laptop?
12:51	<eck>	SaveFerris: i think the file is /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
12:51	<Wymark>	OK, Can someone help me with installing Ubuntu on my XP. I want Ubuntu on a seperate HD than my XP and to be able to switch between them at start-up, but I am somewhat close to clueless on how to do this. Any help would be very appreciated.
12:51	<miranda82>	dcomsa, nope, packard bell, but they use the same card
12:51	<globaldj>	I'm new to Linux how do i install xmms theme and where is it located?
12:51	<trevor_>	cedric, is this easy to do. . . sorry im new to linux really - attempted it on suse and failed miserably. . .and then decided suse sucked. . .
12:51	<TashKavarish>	iftab only lists eth0 interesting
12:51	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i saw it on google, that lots of asus have the same problem
12:51	<belux>	patrick_: thx, It's worked!
12:51	<jdsbluedevl>	penguin42: did you get my message?
12:51	<SaveFerris>	eck: what if i can't get to terminal? i'm stuck in grub because when i try to boot into recovery mode, it hangs indefinetely
12:51	<pleed>	can someone please help me i cant install libapache2-mod-security over apt-get. it says that there is an entry in the database but the file is not on the server... there s also no descriptopn to libapache2-mod-security. can anyone confirm that on feisty fawn?
12:51	<kitche>	ResPiDeR: the window manager hs to be started metacity gets replaaced with emerald or something else but it's not when the new window manager is started
12:51	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: No
12:51	<eck>	SaveFerris: use the recovery option
12:51	<patrick_>	belux, no probs nice one:)
12:51	<jdsbluedevl>	hmm, let me send it again
12:51	<eck>	SaveFerris: it will drop you into a root console
12:51	<Pelo>	Wymark,  just install ubuntu to your second hdd, and it will install grub at as aboot manager, that will give you a menu when you boot so you can select which os you want
12:52	<dcomsa>	miranda82: strange, i have an asus aca3 and it works
12:52	<SaveFerris>	eck: lol i'll try again
12:52	<cedricshock>	trevor_: The big packages for you toinstall later will be apache2, mysql-server, and php5-(something gotta look it up)
12:52	<Pelo>	Wymark,  you donT need to do anything special
12:52	<Wymark>	Oh, ok sorry. THANK YOU.
12:52	<compengi>	Wymark: you just need to make the ubuntu partition ext3 or ext2 then install it and you can choose on boot
12:52	<jdsbluedevl>	 all I know is that afterwards, I get this message: "W: udev hook script requires at least kernel version 2.6.17 | W: not generating requested initramfs for kernel 2.6.15-20-386"
12:52	<ResPiDeR>	kitche do you know how do I fix it?
12:52	<jdsbluedevl>	and no, I don't know what a RAID server is
12:52	<patrick_>	!wubi
12:52	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about wubi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
12:52	<trevor_>	cedric, thanks for you help - much appreciated :)
12:53	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Yeah it's pretty easy. You can do everything (except editing config files-need a text editor) with the guis in the desktop
12:53	<Fitzsimmons>	hey all, when I enable desktop effects, it appears to work but my windows don't have any decorations
12:53	<Fitzsimmons>	know how to fix this?
12:53	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: I think that not generating initramfs isn't a problem - it's just trying to update one of your ancient kernels that is there - as for the mdadm - if you don't have a raid, do you have an /etc/mdadm/mdadmconf ?
12:53	<belux>	Guys, problems with boot download Supergrub and be happy: http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot/Super-Grub-Disk-8071.shtml
12:53	<dcomsa>	miranda82: could you check if the driver isn't in your blacklist
12:53	<VR_>	hey guys, i have an old pv with a "DECchip" which is supposed to use the tulip driver, but i can't get it to work. is this a known issue?
12:53	<VR_>	pv = pc
12:53	<jdsbluedevl>	yes, I have that file
12:53	<SaveFerris>	eck: on recovery mode it's giving me emu10k1: unhandled interrupt: 0x43000000 indefinetely (in recovery mode)
12:53	<miranda82>	dcomsa, was it /etc/modules/blacklist?
12:53	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: Take a copy of it, and then delete it and see if it will work then - I don't think you should need it
12:53	<miranda82>	dcomsa, where was it?
12:53	<dcomsa>	miranda82:  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
12:53	<Pelo>	VR_,  try theforum
12:53	<TashKavarish>	penguin42:  so if i put eth1 mac xx:xx:... it should always map the mac's to those ethN ?
12:54	<miranda82>	dcomsa, oh, yes
12:54	<eck>	SaveFerris: ouch. I would try the live cd (or booting off another distro if you have one)
12:54	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Yes
12:54	<kitche>	ResPiDeR: as I said start the window decator(sp?) it might be called emerald or something different I haven't looked at feisty to know what is used in it for desktop effects
12:54	<chrisjs169>	is the ubuntu tracker down? (for torrents)

12:54	<SaveFerris>	and then find the modprobe blacklist and add emu10k1 to it? (with livecd)
12:54	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Probably
12:54	<retry>	it doesnt seem like a kernel modules issue
12:54	<miranda82>	dcomsa, it has: blacklist snd_intel8x0m
12:54	<miranda82>	
12:54	<SaveFerris>	eck: all i've got is the edgy live cd
12:54	<eck>	SaveFerris: yeah, just mount the install somewhere and edit the blacklist file
12:54	<billy>	thx belux.  I was looking for that link yesterday.
12:54	<Pelo>	TashKavarish,  restarting x should do it   ctrl alt backspace
12:54	<eck>	SaveFerris: that's fine
12:55	<gallag>	The bittorrent tracker does not seem to be responding -- any alternate torrents or am I alone?

12:55	<pleed>	hey can anybody help me? the upgrade on feisty fawn deleted my apache2-mod-security and i cant install it now...

12:55	<Orfeous>	so..

01:01	<retry>	then ls
01:01	<retry>	those are your services that startup at boot into the standard runlevel
01:01	<retry>	look for mdadm or evms or even lvms
01:01	<TashKavarish>	penguin42:  well so far so good but the swap doesnt always happen
01:01	<retry>	also try rcS.d
01:02	<TashKavarish>	now if only i could fix the video
01:02	<retry>	then mv the file from a capital S to a lowercase s
01:02	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: i would install the sysv-rc-conf which will manage the init scripts for you
01:02	<retry>	that effectively disables the service
01:02	<retry>	yeah or you can use a cheating GUI script :p
01:02	<retry>	hehe jk
01:02	<eck>	haha
01:02	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: I'm still betting your problem is a DVI link speed problem - either that or you need to get a 1920x1200 modeline with no extra fluff
01:02	<retry>	listen to eck though, he knows way more than I do
01:02	<retry>	eck, fix my sound card :(
01:03	<jdsbluedevl>	ok, and after that's installed, what do I do?
01:03	<eck>	retry: what is the problem with it?
01:03	<Josh__>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=415009  Looks like theres a 3 page forum thing for my problem.  Still no solution.
01:03	<retry>	feisty aint detecting it
01:03	<retry>	the hardware is detected
01:03	<miranda82>	dcomsa, any ideaS?
01:03	<dcomsa>	miranda82: have you used edgy before?
01:03	<retry>	its loadint the right drivers
01:03	<miranda82>	dcomsa, yes
01:03	<retry>	but I got no soundcard detected by alsa
01:03	<ruzz>	anyone know how to get feisty which installs php 5.2 by default back down to php 5.1.6 (which is what edgy uses)?
01:03	<dcomsa>	miranda82: did the sound worked?
01:03	<retry>	and no soundcard in /proc/
01:03	<miranda82>	dcomsa, yes, and under dapper also
01:03	<DiceyDays>	Can someone tell me the best way to upgrade to edgy from dapper. Either (sudo update-manager -c) or messing around with my repository?

01:04	<ubotu>	Vinitious: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
01:04	<jdsbluedevl>	eck, sysv-rc-conf is now installed.  what next?
01:04	<retry>	atiixp (my cards driver) codec acquire timeout
01:04	<retry>	and that goes on and on
01:04	<eck>	SaveFerris: i believe you put something like: blacklist em10k1
01:04	<retry>	what a mess
01:04	<Vinitious>	what's that, Flannel?
01:04	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: run that command in a terminal
01:04	<Xyon>	okay...
01:05	<eck>	(as root)
01:05	<Flannel>	Vinitious: read what ubotu said
01:05	<Xyon>	I got ubuntu up and running in recovery mode through the ati drivers
01:05	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: and uncheck all the boxes for the service you want to disable
01:05	<Xyon>	if i boot just plain ubuntu, though, i get nothing
01:05	<Azul>	i try to boot the install cd, and i get vertical green lines when the system tries to start the graphical interface.. how can i fix this?
01:05	<compengi_>	!samba
01:05	<ubotu>	samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
=== chrisjs169 is now known as chrisjs169|afk
01:05	<Flannel>	Azul: did you try the safe boot?
01:05	<jdsbluedevl>	so, disable all that say mdadm-raid
01:06	<Azul>	Flannel, yeah, that also didn't work
01:06	<eck>	yeah. when you hit q the changes will be saved and the app will exit
=== nico_ is now known as Nic|
01:06	<Azul>	it failed to start one process then dumped me in CLI
=== patrick_ is now known as Paddy_EIRE
01:06	<jdsbluedevl>	ok, now running sudo update-initramfs -u -k all again
01:07	<jdsbluedevl>	hmm, I guess I have to shut off mdadm as well as mdadm-raid
01:07	<greg_g>	I have a partition question for you:  I have 3 partitions on a 20 gig harddrive, a 7 gig /, 10 gig /home, and 1 gig swap.  I want to merge the / and /home partitions to be one single /, is there a way to do that without destroying / ??  I can destroy /home (backup on another harddrive)
01:07	<LeeJunFan>	hrm, I wonder why growisofs doesn't set realtime priority? I was getting buffer underruns with it until I set the RT prio with chrt (schedutils).
01:07	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: you don't need to regenerate the initramfs to save changes to the init scripts
01:07	<Azul>	why does ubuntu not have a CLI install
01:07	<Flannel>	Azul: they do.  get the Alternate CD.
01:07	<fishcake>	Azul, Alternate does
01:07	<greg_g>	alter... yeah
01:08	<diseaser>	does anyone here much about JACK?
01:08	<Azul>	if they insist on using GUI, they must have good graphic cards support
01:08	<Flannel>	greg_g: Are they setup like that?  / /home swap?
01:08	<TashKavarish>	penguin42:  i dont see how single/dual could matter, the display is singlelink (as are 99% of dvi things) and it worked before I swapped it for a 1440x900 monitor
01:08	<greg_g>	alternate worked for me
01:08	<Azul>	duh!!!
01:08	<jdsbluedevl>	oh, ok, wasn't sure if there was something wrong with the init scripts
01:08	<greg_g>	Flannel: yes
01:08	<erUSUL>	greg_g: i think gparted can do that just destroy home and resize / (if they are contiguous)
01:08	<TashKavarish>	when i swapped back 1920x1200 was gone, 1600x1200 was max
01:08	<jdsbluedevl>	there is nothing wrong with the init scripts, right?
01:08	<neuratix>	installing the nvidiadriver breaks my X in 7.04 :-/
01:08	<Vinitious>	Well, to jump to my question: I installed Ubuntu server 7, as a host on VMware, a LAMP configuration, now booting it I get the so much hated command prompt style login, does anyyone know how I can get a proper interface, the one with buttons???
01:08	<Flannel>	greg_g: then yeah, you can just delete /home and expand /.  You'll need a liveCD
01:08	<greg_g>	erUSUL: sweet
01:08	<SaveFerris>	eck: it's still doing it
01:08	<JN_Coward>	I am trying to install FreeImage, but the JPEG library seems to be broken, does someone know what packages I need or otherewise how to fix this?
01:08	<greg_g>	got about 5 liveCDs :)
01:08	<Azul>	neuratix, ubuntu doesn't seem to like nvidia cards
01:08	<kbrooks>	Vinitious, ubuntu server is not ubuntu desktop.
01:09	<Wiseguy>	hey guys, if i want a commandline program to execure on startup where would i add it?
01:09	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: OK, well in that case you need to find a 1920x1200 mode line that fits in 155MHz bandwidth
01:09	<eck>	SaveFerris: remove the splash and quiet lines from the kernel line in grub and see if you can figure out where it is trying to load the module
01:09	<Flannel>	Vinitious: If you want buttons, you'll need to install a GUI.  The server is CLI only by default.
01:09	<Amqui>	hello everyone, i got an gp2x mk2 with firmware 2.0, its like a usb storage device for the OS, but I'm able to get it recognize by ubuntu edgy, why shoul I do ? thanks you
01:09	<Azul>	where do i get the alternate cd install from?
01:09	<kbrooks>	Wiseguy, are you using gnome?
01:09	<Wiseguy>	kbrooks, yes
01:09	<Flannel>	Azul: releases.ubuntu.com
01:09	<Azul>	do i have to download another 600MB to get this thing working
01:09	<JN_Coward>	Vinitious: install gnome or kde?
01:09	<Azul>	?
01:09	<Vinitious>	kbrooks, there's no interface for the server edition, or do I have to install it??
01:09	<jrib>	!download >	Azul    (Azul, see the private message from ubotu)
01:09	<jdsbluedevl>	well either way, running update-initramfs does not remove the message
01:09	<greg_g>	thanks Flannel and erUSUL btw
01:09	<jrib>	Azul: get what thing working?
01:09	<LjL>	how do you change locale settings? (i.e. what's output by "locale")
01:09	<nuOpus>	does anyone know what I can use to take video of a session and save it as flash?
01:10	<xtknight>	Azul, http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
01:10	<kbrooks>	Vinitious, there's none but u can get a GUI
01:10	<holden>	Wiseguy: /etc/rc.local
01:10	<Azul>	jrib, get ubuntu install working
01:10	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: no such thing, lowest ive found is that 193 pixel clock one
01:10	<xtknight>	LjL, LC_* environment variables (type env for an example)
01:10	<Vinitious>	no option for that while installing JN_coward
01:10	<TashKavarish>	but the 155 doesnt add up
01:10	<LjL>	xtknight: right, but i mean permanently - where're they supposed to be set?
01:10	<JN_Coward>	Vinitious: sudo apt-get install gnome or something...
01:10	<TashKavarish>	its like the videocard side is messing it up or something, putting an artificial limit
01:10	<Azul>	my god! the alternate install is another 700MB
01:10	<disinterested>	nu0pus: recordmy desktop does the video of ur desktop but it uses alot of hd space
01:10	<Flannel>	nuOpus: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreenCasts
01:11	<soothsay>	Azul: Huh? You only need one of them
01:11	<greg_g>	oh, I guess one more question about the partition thing, after I delete /home and expand /, do I just copy /home to the / ??
01:11	<xtknight>	LjL, ah im not sure
01:11	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Well somewhere between your monitor and display card they've decided they have a limit of 155 on that DVI link - now I don't know if that is unreasonable or not - you might be able to turn it up somewhere
01:11	<Vinitious>	sudo apt-get install kde for kde?
01:11	<fishcake>	Vinitious, do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
01:11	<JN_Coward>	Vintious: google around if you MUST have a GUI, but seriously, if you are running a server, what do you want it for?
01:11	<Flannel>	greg_g: /home will be gone after you delete it.
01:11	<fishcake>	Vinitious, do sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
01:11	<TashKavarish>	theres a thought, how could i temporarely swap to a generic video driver, one that supports 1920x1200 as software rendering only
=== root__ is now known as Xyon
01:11	<Wiseguy>	holden, is there any sort of synatx for adding a command? or just type it in before the "exit 0"vline?
01:11	<Azul>	soothsay, but i already download the default install disc just to find out that i have to get the other one
01:11	<holden>	Wiseguy: just add it before "exit 0"
01:11	<greg_g>	so then while still in the liveCD I recreate the home folder?
01:12	<Xyon>	I've got Ubuntu up and running, but could only do so by booting into recovery mode and using startx.  How can I get my typical setup of Ubuntu to run fine from grub?
01:12	<jdsbluedevl>	eck, I'm still receiving the "defines no arrays" message in update-initramfs.  Should that still be cause for concern, or just disable mdadm?
01:12	<soothsay>	Azul: Look into jigdo
=== tesuki_ is now known as tesuki
01:12	<SaveFerris>	eck: i removed the quiet line, which one is splash? i've got root, kernel, initrd, and savedefault
01:12	<jean_>	No sketchup like software for linux.. :-)
01:12	<Flannel>	greg_g: eh?  Inside of the / partition, you'l need to copy your /home stuff
01:12	<Vinitious>	JN, to perform some things like setting up an FTP server, I have too setup a website
01:12	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: if you aren't running mdadm i don't think it will be a problem
01:12	<jrib>	LjL: I'm guessing gdm will set those if you change language when you login
01:12	<SaveFerris>	nvm
01:12	<SaveFerris>	i found it
01:12	<pse>	/where dippe2
01:12	<pse>	..
01:12	<pse>	sry
01:12	<latoo>	Vinitious: if you need a gui, you may as well install Ubuntu desktop and then install your service stuff on top
01:13	<Betzefer>	how can i hok up my laptop to my tv using my tv out
01:13	<Betzefer>	 ?
01:13	<jean_>	Bad... I need to design a House...
01:13	<greg_g>	Flannel: yeah, so I don't just boot LiveCD, delete /home, expand /, reboot.  Before I reboot, I copy the backup of /home to the now expanded / right?
01:13	<LjL>	jrib: he's on KDE, but you know, when you install the installer asks about location and language... i wonder what the package to reconfigure is, if it's a package to reconfigure. do you have a "LANGUAGE" variables in "locale", anyway?
01:13	<Xyon>	I've got Ubuntu up and running, but could only do so by booting into recovery mode and using startx.  How can I get my typical setup of Ubuntu to run fine from grub?
01:13	<jdsbluedevl>	eck, even after disabling mdadm, I still get the mdadm errors
01:13	<dcomsa>	need some help with lirc + tvtime. anyone with a good tutorial?
01:13	<Azul>	is it easy to install the nvidia drivers in the new ubuntu?
01:13	<antioch>	Can anyone tell me how I can enable the following on ubuntu: instead of spinning the scroll wheel to scroll through documents, hold down the scroll wheel and move the mouse up and down to scroll -- thanks!
01:13	<swinchen>	Hi there.  Does anyone have a WinPVR-150 up and working?  my friend has one and he is having a heck of a time with it.
01:13	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: this is when you are booting?
01:13	<Vinitious>	yes, but configuring LAMP takes a lot of time for me, latoo
01:13	<jrib>	LjL: locale doens't output LANGUAGE here
01:13	<latoo>	Azul: was easy for me
01:14	<jdsbluedevl>	no, this is the update-initramfs
01:14	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i fixed it
01:14	<Flannel>	greg_g: Wrong order.  You mount both, copy /homes partition contents into /s partition (in the folder /home) then delete /home and expand /.
01:14	<dcomsa>	miranda82: cool. how?
01:14	<latoo>	Vinitious: so what's your question...
01:14	<jdsbluedevl>	I haven't tried booting yet, b/c I'm concerned that I won't be able to boot again
01:14	<izm99>	hey all.  I get the following error when dist-upgrading from dapper to feisty: http://rafb.net/p/aliRnc69.html  any suggestions?
01:14	<miranda82>	dcomsa,
01:14	<Flannel>	greg_g: Once you've deleted /home (the partition), there won't be any data to copy
01:14	<Flannel>	izm99: you can't upgrade from dapper to feisty.  You need to go through edgy
01:14	<Azul>	latoo, did you do apt-get install nvidia-glx?
01:14	<miranda82>	dcomsa, compiling the driver
01:14	<miranda82>	dcomsa, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
01:15	<LjL>	jrib: i thought so, neither does it here... but it does for him, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16687/ , and might be related to the VLC errors he gets http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16686/
01:15	<izm99>	Flannel, oh.  darn.  :(
01:15	<jean_>	%C7Any google sketchup like program for linux???
01:15	<latoo>	Azul: no, used the "restricted manager" thing in the admin menu
01:15	<systemd0wn>	Question - fresh install of 7.04, internal Atheros wifi card worked fine.  After playing with kismet a bit (and working) i booted back to windows and while it shows the wifi card there it will not connect to a network, or scan.  Booted back to ubuntu same thing... ideas?
01:15	<greg_g>	yeah, right, I meant, backup /home now (to hdb1), boot LiveCD, delete /home, expand /, copy /home to now expanded /
01:15	<Vinitious>	how too het a GUI, latoo, I am gonna try: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop like someone metioned
01:15	<izm99>	Flannel, ok, thx.
01:15	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: i'm not sure how you would be able to tell if it was a problem without rebooting
01:15	<Vinitious>	how to get
01:15	<jdsbluedevl>	well, I guess I'll just try to reboot and see what happens
01:15	<SaveFerris>	eck: just by sheer luck, it loaded the whole thing (this happens like once in 10 tries) so i'll try and actually fix the alsa problem now, thanks alot though
01:15	<covOPprometheus>	I just dist-upgraded from edgy to feisty, but the wvdial package breaks at setup and therefore ubuntu-desktop is unable to install. how can I fix this (modem is not needed)
01:15	<dcomsa>	miranda82: :) beleive me or not, i was going to suggest that
01:15	<Flannel>	greg_g: ah, copy your backup, yeah.  Therell be a folder /home inside of that partition, put the stuff you backed up inside of there.  And you'll need to delete the /home line in your fstab too.
01:15	<miranda82>	dcomsa, lol, it worked
01:16	<jdsbluedevl>	hopefully I'll be back
01:16	<Azul>	latoo, thanks for telling me cuz i got enough problems with ubuntu already
01:16	<dcomsa>	miranda82: well good news
01:16	<latoo>	Vinitious: if you don't want to reinstall you can do that or apt-get gnome-desktop. X is a waste of ram for a server but if you need it you may as well install the desktop distro. It'd be easier
01:16	<robbie_crash>	Why would hardware info crash right off the bat, off a fresh upgrade to 7.04?
01:16	<greg_g>	Flannel: delete /home in fstab ??  lost me there
01:16	<miranda82>	dcomsa, thx for helping
01:16	<dcomsa>	miranda82: now, do you happen to have some experiences with tv tunners? :)
01:16	<tatter1>	I just got lircd working on my avermedia  studio infrared V chuffed :)
01:16	<jean_>	%C7Alguem sabe de um software igual ao %C4google sketchup para Linux???
01:16	<Flannel>	greg_g: in a file, /etc/fstab, it tells your computer what to mount where.  You'll need to remove the /home one, since you no longer have a home partition
01:16	<andre_pl>	so who's got wireless? :P
01:17	<Flannel>	!es | jean_
01:17	<ubotu>	jean_: Si busca ayuda en Espaol por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, all obtendr mas ayuda.
01:17	<Vinitious>	can I bother you for a second in PM, latoo, it goes way too fast here?
01:17	<greg_g>	Flannel: ahh, makes sense
01:17	<Rage__>	Ok, I am having serious problems with my laptop's crappy soundcard. Realtec ACL202 rev 0 / ATI IXP it will play for a while then start jumping and statiking any ideas?
01:17	<latoo>	Vinitious: sure
01:17	<antioch>	How can i configure linux so that when I hold down the middle button (mouse wheel) and I then move the mouse up or down it will make the current window scroll up or down?
01:17	<Enselic_>	Has anyone succeded in connecting to a remote Ubuntu X server? I am failing but I am not sure why...
01:17	<Flannel>	Enselic_: Are you using XDMCP? or what?
01:18	<latoo>	Enselic_: how are you trying? tried "ssh -X remote"?
01:18	<dcomsa>	jono: do you have a good link on how to configure lirc (given your post on the planet)?
01:18	<Enselic_>	Flannel, latto: I'm trying to set DISPLAY=ltop:0  where ltop is my laptop, and I try to connect from my desktop
01:18	<greg_g>	thanks a lot Flannel, I do this later tonight
01:19	<jrib>	LjL: tried reconfiguring locales?  is this in #kubuntu?
01:19	<Pelo>	antioch,  I remember seeing someting about that in the forum,  or something similar,   you need to modify xorg.conf to configure your mouse button,   check in the forum
01:19	<latoo>	Enselic_: I just use ssh when I want to run a single app. No idea about remoting x though
01:19	<antioch>	Pelo I did but couldnt get any relevant hits - any idea what the article you were reading was called?
01:20	<LjL>	jrib: it was in #kubuntu, it's in a private query now (you know, pastes and such, sigh). anyway, i'm realizing it's a complete mess. i thought he was on edgy, but apparently he's really on dapper with an edgy sources.list
01:20	<pleed>	can someone tell me how to downgrade to edgy eft if it s possible
01:20	<Pelo>	antioch,   I'm pretty sure it wasn't about that specificaly,  but search for mouse buttons
01:20	<kbrooks>	I have a problem. A  basic one that Ubuntu seems to be missing.
01:20	<pse>	HL
01:20	<eck>	pleed: it is not possible without reinstalling
01:21	<soothsay>	kbrooks: Okay
01:21	<dcomsa>	lirc expert wanted :)
01:21	<robbie_crash>	Is there a way to check to make sure that everything is installed properly?
01:21	<jrib>	LjL: I got these locale errors during edgy upgrade, was painful.  So that is probably related
01:21	<kbrooks>	I have a wireless windows computer on a network. *How* (with or without samba) do I share files between the two of them?
01:21	<xtknight>	oh LjL is it the perl errors
01:21	<xtknight>	i got those in a chroot
01:21	<jrib>	pleed: only by reinstalling
01:21	<LjL>	xtknight: among other things, yeah
01:21	<xtknight>	about invalid LC_ALL or w/e
01:21	<pleed>	well thanks jrib
01:21	<xtknight>	yeah it's easy to fix, too bad i dont remember what i did
01:22	<kbrooks>	I prefer without samba
01:22	<xtknight>	i had googled around fora while
01:22	<harttml>	anyone want to tak on gnome vs kde
01:22	<jrib>	harttml: #ubuntu-offtopic
01:22	<latoo>	kbrooks: Ubuntu can connect to windows shares out of the box
01:22	<pleed>	and whole reconfiguration should do "dpkg --configure -a" ?
01:22	<dcomsa>	c'mon ppl, i got to make my bloody remote to work. anyone with lirc experience?
01:22	<kbrooks>	latoo, I don't want to do a windows share for now. Must I?
01:22	<jrib>	pleed: that configures anything that isn't configured
01:22	<latoo>	kbrooks: no, there's alternatives but less easy
01:23	<TokenBad>	ok I got the new ubuntu and want to dualboot with windows 2000...is there a tutorial for this or can someone tell me how to safely do it?
01:23	<pleed>	jrib, and when i want to bring my ubuntu to default configuration?
01:23	<eck>	kbrooks: if you just want to grab things off the computer just do places >	network
01:23	<kbrooks>	latoo, well, the reason is that I'm on xubuntu, heh :-)
01:23	<pigeonflight>	anyone setup feisty on a macbook pro yet?
01:23	<latoo>	kbrooks: if you install cygwin on the windows machine you can use SSH, which is secure
01:23	<jrib>	pleed: what kind of settings are we talking about?
01:23	<tatter1>	all I can say about lirc   is using input device whatever instead gpoi eeetc and irrecord rmoteee instead of teemplaate
01:23	<hardman>	tokenbad: depending on what you want to do, I just installed the new ubuntu on my work laptop dual booting with XP. most painless linux experiecne ever
01:23	<qwerxy>	hi - does anyone have 2 mins to help me with my feisty install please? i'm trying to install it on a dell xps m2010, trying to boot into the live cd, the default install option just ends up with the computer shutting down, the vga options just fail to start the x server - i have an install of edgy on the machine already which has never caused any probs!any advice gratefully received :)
01:23	<hardman>	:_
01:23	<Enverex>	Does anyone know what script ubotu uses?
01:23	<kbrooks>	latoo, I can't install cygwin.
01:23	<pleed>	jrib well the whole system... i made great shit
01:24	<TokenBad>	hardman ok...I just don't want to lose windows
01:24	<soothsay>	qwerxy: Why don't you upgrade
01:24	<jrib>	pleed: but are these user level changes or?
01:24	<Skwid_>	ahhhh
01:24	<TokenBad>	I will try it and see
01:24	<Skwid_>	anybody know how to get dual screen working on a laptop ?
01:24	<Skwid_>	should i use xinerama ?
01:24	<qwerxy>	soothsay: i'm trying to upgrade!
01:24	<xilly>	Enselic : you can always try to use vnc to connect to your desktop
01:24	<pulse>	upgrade will take the rest of your life.
01:24	<latoo>	kbrooks: that limits your options then. There's an X server for windows...
01:24	<pulse>	grab a beer and relax
01:25	<latoo>	kbrooks: or ftp...
01:25	<covOPprometheus>	I just dist-upgraded from edgy to feisty, but the wvdial package breaks at setup and therefore ubuntu-desktop is unable to install. how can I fix this (modem is not needed)
01:25	<Hubris>	I need to revert back to an older version of a package than is offered under Feisty...as they broke it a couple versions ago.  I'm assuming I need to add an Edgy repository, and use Synaptic to try force the downgrade....correct?
01:25	<pleed>	jrib i did something wrong in aptitude so a lot of software deinstalled and now some programs say that they need resources, the upgrade crashed my apache2 .... and my mysql server has been deleted too
01:25	<darx>	hi folks
01:25	<Enselic_>	xilly: well yes I could indeed, but I'd like to test the network transparency of X
01:25	<xilly>	Enselic_ : you can always try to use vnc to connect to your desktop
01:25	<darx>	how can i restart samba in feisty
01:25	<darx>	?
01:25	<kbrooks>	latoo, I'll try FTP. Is there a way to install in a few clicks?
01:25	<darx>	i don't see smb in init.d
01:25	<barbarella_me>	darx:/etc/init.d/samba restart
01:25	<soothsay>	qwerxy: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
01:25	<jrib>	pleed: you can try pastebinning specific error messages
01:25	<latoo>	kbrooks: install on which?
01:26	<kbrooks>	latoo, with sane configuration
01:26	<pleed>	jrib, pastebinning? what s that i dont understand
01:26	<kbrooks>	latoo, install on which what
01:26	<xilly>	Enselic_ : oh ok , but with ssh I think that you can run only 1 aplication at the time
01:26	<jrib>	!pastebin | pleed
=== Gunrun is now known as Gunrun|Bed
01:26	<ubotu>	pleed: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
01:26	<NemesisD>	hi, i have totem and mplayer, both of which should be able to play FLV files at this point but whenever I open an FLV file each application opens for a second then closes, whats up with that?
01:26	<robbie_crash>	I am missing one hard drive from my fstab, it's listed, but apparently its uuid and dev/* have changed since upgrading so it will no longer mount. How can I determine what it is, when it doesn't show up in gparted, and I can't open hardware information  because it crashes as soon as I load it up. I have two questions: 1) how can I figure out what the drive is now, and 2) how can I fix the crashing with hardware information?
01:26	<jrib>	NemesisD: any output on a terminal?
01:26	<eck>	Hubris: if it is just one package, I think you are best off downloading the .deb, reinstalling it, and then pinning it with apt_preferences
01:26	<qwerxy>	soothsay: oh - i see what you mean - yes i could do that, but i'd also like to know why this isn't working...?
01:26	<latoo>	kbrooks: install ftp server or client on ubuntu or windows?
01:26	<pleed>	ah i see thanks jrib,ubotu
01:26	<Enselic_>	xilly: I'm not talking about using ssh, just setting DISPLAY=host:0
01:26	<NemesisD>	jrib, lemme try, do i just type mplayer filename.flv in terminal?
01:26	<Vinitious>	sas I understand, when running Ubuntu server, normally one configures everything trough the command prompt?
01:27	<jrib>	NemesisD: yep
01:27	<kbrooks>	latoo, the client is there already.
01:27	<NemesisD>	k
01:27	<kbrooks>	Vinitious, not everything, u can use gui
01:27	<jrib>	Vinitious: yes, unless you install X
01:27	<kronus_>	I lost all sound after updating to Feisty.  Is this common/are there any fixes?
01:27	<tatter1>	 /join #linuxx
01:27	<joshjosh_>	What's the best DVD Authoring software?
01:27	<kbrooks>	Vinitious, apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
01:27	<Hubris>	eck - It's the VNC4Server package....I know the revision under Edgy that 'worked'....the update in Edgy broke it..so I stayed with the old one.  Feisty doesn't offer that old version.
01:27	<pse>	Hi! This example tells me how to setup a CRT monitor.. but I'm using a LCD monitor.. should I write "--force-monitor=lcd1,notv" or something similar? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto#head-42bafbcee7a10ed50f2d9016555557b9874be252
01:27	<latoo>	look in synaptic for ftp server if you need on ubuntu. I don't know, I wouldn't install that on mine because ssh is more secure
01:27	<robbie_crash>	!best joshjosh
01:27	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about best joshjosh - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
01:27	<robbie_crash>	!best | joshjosh
01:27	<ubotu>	joshjosh: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
01:27	<NemesisD>	jrib, X11 error: BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)?,?% 0 0
01:27	<Vinitious>	yes, the server is busy on that, kbrooks
01:28	<joshjosh_>	robbie_crash, just give me a recommendation
01:28	<latoo>	honestly, even a windows share might be more secure than ftp :-)
01:28	<jrib>	NemesisD: totem gives the same?
01:28	<darx>	ok.. there is no samba file under init.d/
01:28	<eck>	Hubris: you can find the version you want by digging around here http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/
01:28	<pleed>	jrib, well i think i will reinstall... doesnt make any sense at all it ll be faster like that and i have a german version so i cant really translate the error messages... thanks a lot
01:28	<jasin>	The fawn was feisty, but I got the system upgraded.
01:28	<darx>	so how do i restart windows networking
01:28	<kbrooks>	latoo, i cant do one.
01:28	<latoo>	kbrooks: is this a temporary solution?
01:28	<NemesisD>	jrib, yep, same business about insufficient resources
01:28	<barbarella_me>	darx:is samba server installed?
01:28	<jrib>	pleed: ok, that is probably faster, just take it as a learning experience
01:28	<robbie_crash>	joshjosh, with an infinite number of choices, how can I give you a recommendation without knowing more about what you need to do?
01:29	<darx>	does nautilus depend on samba to browse shares?
01:29	<indecision>	so does anyone have experience with Feisty, the restricted ATI drivers, and running at a resolution above 1152x864?  'cause I can't get it to work.  at all.  tried custom modelines, the best I could do was 1280x960 (good) at 95hz (bad!)
01:29	<pleed>	yes i do jrib
01:29	<kbrooks>	latoo, no, and will never be, unless the owner sells me the laptop
01:29	<bayziders>	How do you install a gdm theme?
01:29	<jrib>	NemesisD: what video driver do you use?
01:29	<eavatar>	hey, I am kinda new here and I am facing a sound issue with my version (6.10)
01:29	<NemesisD>	i think i8l0 intel or something like that
01:29	<latoo>	kbrooks: um...email yourself the files in gmail.
01:29	<moDumass>	hey all, i have a 1gig thumb drive, but i cant put a 700mb file on it because it says available spave 625mb, now theres nothing else on there
01:29	<JDSBlueDevl>	good news, the kernel did boot
01:29	<yoni>	when i compile an RT61 wlan driver i'm getting errors 1+2 does those codes refer to a package that i'll might have missing?
01:29	<eck>	bayziders: system >	administration >	login window, then drag the .tar.gz into the box with the themes
01:29	<darx>	barbarella_me: i'm browsing share via nautilus.. i need to restart whatever service is allowing me access to the shares.. i don't know if samba is installed
01:29	<Vinitious>	so SSH is an alternative for the good old FTP
01:30	<kbrooks>	latoo, no, i;d rather ftp instead. thanks.
01:30	<latoo>	Vinitious: yes
01:30	<eck>	Vinitious: no, they are for different things
01:30	<jasin>	Anyone know what the alternate desktop cd is? I
01:30	<jasin>	Anyone know what the alternate desktop cd is?
01:30	<eck>	Vinitious: there are some things that ssh would not be suitable for that ftp would
01:30	<Vinitious>	eh, yes or no?
01:30	<JDSBlueDevl>	thx a bunch eck, although I have a feeling I'll have to live with that annoying mdadm array message
01:30	<Vinitious>	file transfer?
01:30	<jasin>	Sounds like its xubuntu, says its for systems with less then 256mbs.
01:30	<darx>	barbarella_me: i'm not running a samba server... just a client
01:30	<eck>	Vinitious: ssh is a waste if you don't need encryption and usually implies that you are going to give users login accounts
01:30	<magnetron>	Vinitious: yes, ssh has file transfer too
01:30	<jrib>	jasin: it's the tradition text-based install (no X needed to install) and lets you use the disk as a repository for ugprading as well
01:30	<barbarella_me>	darx:no you don't, cause you are using smbclient, not the server
01:31	<Vinitious>	ok
01:31	<cables>	I've installed libdvdcss2 from the Seveas repository, and DVDs play fine when I insert them. However, if I open totem and go to Movie>Play Disc, it doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas?
01:31	<darx>	babbarella_me: so how do i restart it?
01:31	<jasin>	jrib, I see, thanks.
01:31	<eck>	Vinitious: but ssh is very good if you need encryption or already have a login and don't want another service running
01:31	<eavatar>	for some reason I can't listen any sound, but when I do the sound test it is ok and generates a loud pitch
01:31	<latoo>	Vinitious: you can use gnome-vfs to connect to an ssh server (ie. places menu) to transfer files in nautilus
01:31	<bayziders>	eck: thanks.
01:31	<systemd0wn>	Question - fresh install of 7.04, internal Atheros wifi card worked fine.  After playing with kismet a bit (and working) i booted back to windows and while it shows the wifi card there it will not connect to a network, or scan.  Booted back to ubuntu same thing no networks... ideas?
01:31	<latoo>	Vinitious: or use scp
01:31	<jasin>	jrib, why not just use xubuntu instead though?
01:31	<barbarella_me>	darx:you can't
01:31	<elpargo>	hi does 7.04 was ship with a highly verbose python or is that a new feature of 2.5?
01:31	<magnetron>	Vinitious: don't use ftp, it is very insecure
01:31	<flugenhiber>	anybody got any ideas about grub error 17?
01:31	<covOPprometheus>	I just dist-upgraded from edgy to feisty, but the wvdial package breaks at setup and therefore ubuntu-desktop is unable to install. how can I fix this (modem is not needed)
01:31	<darx>	hmmm
01:32	<NemesisD>	jrib, i had to use an alternative version  of the i8l0 driver because it didnt' like my widescreen resolution
01:32	<jrib>	jasin: xubuntu is not the same
01:32	<robbie_crash>	I am missing one hard drive from my fstab, it's listed, but apparently its uuid and dev/* have changed since upgrading so it will no longer mount. How can I determine what it is, when it doesn't show up in gparted, and I can't open hardware information  because it crashes as soon as I load it up. I have two questions: 1) how can I figure out what the drive is now, and 2) how can I fix the crashing with hardware information?
01:32	<kitche>	jasin: the alternate cd is for people that don't like the livecd and it's debian like
01:32	<barbarella_me>	darx:a client is not a service
01:32	<xilly>	Enselic_ : hum , I never used it, I think that I can't help you because I always used ssh -X to connect to my pc, what I was thinking that your problem was how to connect to your pc from a remote place, but that is clearly not your problem . I'm Sory that I can't help you
01:32	<Vinitious>	it's for a local testing server for now, I'll check SSH one time, got enough acronyms for the day now ;-)
01:32	<jrib>	NemesisD: hmm, do you think taht may be related?  Try using vesa just to see if the problem goes away
01:32	<eck>	magnetron: it can be insecure to use ssh when you really want to be using ftp
01:32	<jasin>	jrib, I understand but it runs well on older systems also and it has a desktop.
01:32	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, uninstall the package?
01:32	<eck>	magnetron: e.g. if you want anonymous access
01:33	<jrib>	jasin: right, but for some people, they may not be able to get into X at all
01:33	<NemesisD>	jrib, i'm willing to try it, but how do i change it back and forth? i'm not too experienced with that
01:33	<Enselic_>	xilly: np
01:33	<magnetron>	eck: very true
01:33	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, I tried so, but the thing is I can't install ubuntu-desktop without it
01:33	<testytester>	anyone have problems with beryl on feisty?
01:33	<_doppelganger_>	argh, back
01:33	<jasin>	kitche, see the response I gave jrib
01:33	<jrib>	NemesisD: make a backup of /etc/X11/xorg.conf then run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and choose vesa.  After you are done restore the backup
01:33	<Hydrocodone>	woo, just installed and got mr res working, its been awhile :D
01:33	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, ahhh wonderfull "base install", how about trying to upgrade that package first?
01:33	<bitmess>	testytester: I have problems with Beryl on anything
01:33	<jasin>	jrib, 256mb wont get you into the desktop on xubuntu?
01:34	<indecision>	robbie_crash: you could try replacing the UUID in your fstab file with the drive's device name instead.  you'll need to figure out that that is, of course.
01:34	<samk>	does anyone know how to install icon themes?
01:34	<tommyv>	hiiiiiiii
01:34	<atiredmachine>	Hello, when I downloaded the latest updates to Feisty like a week ago I could no longer boot up using the newest kernel (2.6.20-15).. I've filed a bug report and nobody I've talked to has any ideas.. so my question is, is there a way I can just install that one so that GRUB will default to 2.6.20-14 instead on bootup so I don't have to sit make sure I select the right one?
01:34	<testytester>	I have a toshiba satellite, and it worked fine on edgy
01:34	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, did you dist-upgrade to latest 6.10 before trying to go to 7.4?
01:34	<atiredmachine>	*uninstall
01:34	<kitche>	jasin: what does that have to do with my response I don't like the livecd sicne I have tons of them anyways and the livecd needs more then 256 mb but gnoem can run on 256 megs of ram easily
01:34	<kitche>	gnome*
01:34	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, yes
01:34	<tommyv>	Hello, I messed up my XServer and now it won't load and I was wondering what I can do to restore it to default?
01:34	<eck>	atiredmachine: use the savedefault option in your menu.lst
01:34	<bayziders>	I have a .emerald theme file and when i try to import it it says "Eroor calling tar"
01:34	<testytester>	any know how to get beryl to work on toshiba sattelite on feisty.
01:34	<jrib>	jasin: there are other issues, some video cards just don't work with X.  The alternate cd is there as an option
01:34	<robbie_crash>	indecision, I can't figure that out without hardware information or fdisk, and it doesn't show up in either
01:34	<dcoms1>	samk: download them and drag them on theme manager
01:34	<NemesisD>	alright ill give it a try and let you know jrib, thanks!
01:35	<jasin>	kitche, then we are in agreement, I dont like live cd's much either
01:35	<jrib>	jasin: well, just don't work right away, is what I should have said
01:35	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, wvdial doesn't set up, I have read about the bug with wvstreams, but haven't found a solution that works for me
01:35	<robbie_crash>	well it might in hw info, but since that keeps crashing :(
01:35	<testytester>	I already tried the beryl channel
01:35	<latoo>	tommyv: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
01:35	<eck>	atiredmachine: it is called something like that -- it makes it so grub selects the last kernel you booted
01:35	<indecision>	robbie_crash: how's the drive physically connected?
01:35	<tommyv>	thanks latoo
01:35	<robbie_crash>	ide
01:35	<jasin>	jrib, ok
01:35	<tommyv>	quit
01:35	<samk>	I downloaded it and It gave me a thing called index.theme and when I drag it it says invalide file format
01:35	<eXcAliBuR>	when using ispconfig for hosting websites, when the website is configured for lets say ip 192.168.1.202 ... must it be registered in order to use it... if i put "192.168.1.202   hostname" in my windows host file... should i still get something?
01:35	<eXcAliBuR>	it justs tells me shared ip
01:35	<atiredmachine>	eck, thanks, I'll check it out.
01:35	<mtm8>	How do I chroot into a loopback mount?
01:35	<robbie_crash>	and it was working fine up until rebooting after upgrading to feisty
01:36	<eavatar>	hey, I am kinda new here and I am facing a sound issue with my version (6.10) for some reason I can't listen any sound, but when I do the sound test it is ok and generates a loud pitch
01:36	<soothsay>	eXcAliBuR: I don't understand your question but 192.168.1.202 is a local ip address
=== dcoms1 is now known as dcomsa
01:36	<eXcAliBuR>	soothsay : i'll try again
01:36	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, then I don't know I don't use that package.
01:36	<pleed>	jrib, do you know where i can find my cronfiles?
01:36	<mtm8>	Anyone know?
01:36	<magnetron>	i have got this strange issue: now and then when the computer starts up, it starts in 640x480 screen resolution. if I restart the X server with ctrl+alt+bkspace, it is normal (1280x1024@50Hz) again. How can make it start normal EVERY time?
01:36	<soothsay>	Does anyone know how long the "Installing kernel" portion of a server install should take?
01:37	<MrMakeveli>	anyone know any decent sound apps besides audacity?
01:37	<eck>	pleed: use the crontab command
01:37	<hyperspace>	anyone know if there is a log i can tail to check the status of a dist-upgrade(upgrade via gui - left notebook at work updating)
01:37	<indecision>	robbie_crash: how's the drive physically connected?  IDE?  SATA?  something else?
01:37	<robbie_crash>	indecision, ide
01:37	<soothsay>	soothsay: More than 10 minutes on a P2-300 MHz?
01:37	<testytester>	mrmkeveli: Whats your prob?
01:37	<testytester>	again?
01:37	<barbarella_me>	pleed:crontab -e
01:37	<indecision>	robbie_crash: is it on the primary or secondary channel, and is it the master or the slave drive?
01:37	<eXcAliBuR>	i have a webserver behind a firewall... 192.168.1.200 is it's eth connection ... i have eth0:2 as 192.168.1.202  dns (bind9) is setup to say hostname.com = 192.168.1.202
01:37	<robbie_crash>	it's actually on the fourth ide channel as master
01:38	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, can I install a package without it's dependencies? I mean I don't need wvdial anyways
01:38	<jasin>	jrib, system requirements for xubuntu are 128mb, http://www.xubuntu.org/get
01:38	<mtm8>	How do I chroot into a loopback mount?
01:38	<eXcAliBuR>	when i type hostname.com it tells me ip is shared to use hostname instead of ip
01:38	<infinityxi>	it would be nice if audacity used the current gtk+
01:38	<robbie_crash>	indecision, wait, no, third ide channel as master
01:38	<infinityxi>	but it's still fine
01:38	<pleed>	ok see ya all later^^
01:38	<eck>	hyperspace: /var/log/dpkg.log
01:38	<SaveFerris>	Live Cds, load ubuntu entirely from the cd right?
01:38	<cables>	SaveFerris, yep
01:39	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, nop that is one of the problems of debian's build system
01:39	<MrMakeveli>	infinityxi, i really wish it did, its just so ugly. it needs a paper bag to put over its face or something
01:39	<indecision>	robbie_crash: If I'm remembering how this works correctly, that drive *should* be /dev/hde ... try mounting it manually before messing with fstab
01:39	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, ok, thanks for the hint
01:39	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, did you try a reinstall of the offending package?
01:39	<eck>	mtm8: the same as a normal chroot?
01:39	<SaveFerris>	cables: then why is the "start or install ubuntu" with the live cd hanging at startup for the exact same reason (screwy sound driver) as when i load it from my hard drive?
01:39	<dcomsa>	MrMakeveli: xmms, amarok
01:39	<indecision>	remember to specify which partition, too... so /dev/hde1 or whichever
01:39	<infinityxi>	i think it has something to do with the cross platform widgets
01:39	<cables>	SaveFerris, i don't know.
01:39	<infinityxi>	wxwindows?
01:39	<xilly>	Enselic_ : I've just googled "DISPLAY=host:0" and found this site that talks about the the "Xauthorization" , you can be having a problem to connect to the server because of this I don't know, the site is  http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/info/X/Security
01:39	<robbie_crash>	indecision, no luk
01:39	<robbie_crash>	*luckj
01:39	<robbie_crash>	**LUCK
01:39	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, as in reinstall inside synaptics
01:40	<MrMakeveli>	dcomsa, isnt amarok a music player?
01:40	<mtm8>	eck: Well what are the steps for a normal chroot? I'm used to doing it the Gentoo way where I have a nifty little env-update script. Ubuntu doesn't seem to update my environment variables.
01:40	<Enselic_>	xilly: I have the xauth setup already, so I don't think that's the problem
01:40	<MrMakeveli>	dcomsa, im looking for sound editing
01:40	<indecision>	robbie_crash: no luckj?  damnj.  ;)
01:40	<gumjo>	testytester, you have a problem with beryl?
01:40	<elpargo>	MrMakeveli, a little more then that
01:40	<robbie_crash>	:P
01:40	<Enselic_>	xilly: thanks for googling for me anyway :)
01:40	<bayziders>	There's an app called macmenu-applet, can some one help me install it is a very strange package.
01:40	<dcomsa>	MrMakeveli: ohhh sorry
01:40	<ubd>	theres a 3d application that shows fps what is it?
01:40	<dcomsa>	MrMakeveli: jokosher?
01:40	<xilly>	Enselic_ : ok ;)
01:40	<ubd>	something glx etc?
01:40	<robbie_crash>	ubd, glxgears
01:40	<ledbettj>	ubd: glxgears
01:40	<elpargo>	bayziders, is there a package for it??
01:40	<jrib>	!glxgears | ubd
01:40	<ubotu>	ubd: To display the FPS in glxgears, run 'glxgears -printfps' in a terminal.
01:40	<ubd>	thanks!!
01:40	<xilly>	Enselic_ : np :)
01:40	<eck>	mtm8: i would just run the chroot shell as a login shell, i think that will reset them
01:40	<MrMakeveli>	dcomsa, have you used it for sound editing before?
01:40	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, that's the problem, it isn't installed and I can't install it because it breaks at Setting up wvdial (1.56-1.1ubuntu2) .
01:41	<indecision>	robbie_crash: well it's a bit more of a pain, but it's probably detected on boot.  you could look through dmesg
01:41	<g35>	hi has anyone ever used xtightvncviewer?
01:41	<infinityxi>	glxgears -info
01:41	<darx>	my harddrive shows up as sda and its not scsi.. i need to enable dma how do it fix it? can i run hdparm on sda?
01:41	<robbie_crash>	indecision, dmesg?
01:41	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, you do not have wvdial? try installing it alone
01:41	<eck>	mtm8: e.g. chroot /path/to/chroot /bin/bash -l
=== root__ is now known as Xyon
01:41	<bayziders>	elpargo: it is not in synaptic it is a folder with a .server, .c ,.h and a PKGBUILD file in the folder.I can not figure out how to install it.
01:41	<dcomsa>	MrMakeveli: it's a "multi-track studio"
01:41	<jasin>	7.04 feisty fawn runs beautifully on my laptop; however, the touch pad does not work.
01:41	<ajehuk>	g35 - yep and Im sure Im not the only one :)
01:41	<MrMakeveli>	dcomsa, prettier than audacity?
01:41	<testytester>	My dvd broke in feisty kaffeine
01:41	<mtm8>	eck: Do I have to mount proc or anything?
01:42	<testytester>	dvd player
01:42	<indecision>	robbie_crash: type it at a console.  it'll spit out every line of output that's hidden behind the "ubuntu" splash screen when you boot.  everything that happens during startup is logged by it.
01:42	<testytester>	ishoudsay
01:42	<dcomsa>	MrMakeveli: much prettier
01:42	<Xyon>	root@pbd1082:~# compiz --replace gconf
01:42	<Xyon>	/usr/bin/compiz.real: No composite extension
01:42	<Xyon>	Window manager warning: Screen 0 on display ":0.0" already has a window manager; try using the --replace option to replace the current window manager.
01:42	<MrMakeveli>	thank heavens
01:42	<dcomsa>	http://www.jokosher.org/
01:42	<MrMakeveli>	hahah
01:42	<latoo>	bayziders: sounds like a source package? did you try searching for it at getdeb?
01:42	<eck>	mtm8: it depend on what you are trying to do, i always forget when you need it. if you have problems with networking things mount it
01:42	<elpargo>	bayziders, that is not a deb package it seems like a slackware package, I suggest you find a deb or else you will have to a) make a manual build b) learn how to make a .deb
01:42	<indecision>	robbie_crash: you can type something like "dmesg >	~/dmesg.txt" and then open that file in gedit for easier reading/searching
01:42	<darx>	why is my hard drive showing up as sda? it is IDE and not SCSI
01:42	<magnetron>	MrMakeveli: it is in the repositorys
01:42	<disinterested>	i gave a friend of mine a dapper cd. but she has a dial up modem and cant get ubuntu to recognize the modem. so she cant get online to do any thing any solutions?
01:42	<MrMakeveli>	im checkin it out
01:42	<atiredmachine>	occasionally my system freezes up for a few seconds (music keeps playing and mouse still moves, but nothing responds or moves, not even alt-ctrl-d*..)  Any ideas?
01:42	<jrib>	!uuid >	darx    (darx, see the private message from ubotu)
01:42	<jasin>	I see ubuntu still hasn't fixed the synaptics touchpad problems
01:42	<g35>	ajehuk: how can you connect to a server running on a port other than 5900 i tried : but it doesnt work
01:42	<magnetron>	!info jokosher
01:42	<ubotu>	jokosher: simple and easy to use audio multi-tracker. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.2-0ubuntu5 (feisty), package size 432 kB, installed size 1692 kB
01:42	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, same problem, it won't set up, you see the installation isn't the problem, but it freezes at autoconfiguration
01:42	<elpargo>	g35, what problems? I have it running just fine
01:43	<bayziders>	Latoo: What is getdeb?
01:43	<Xyon>	why cant i start compiz?
01:43	<latoo>	bayziders: a deb website. google it
01:43	<ajehuk>	g35 - what ports (I'll recreate the scenarion here and tell you what happens.. )
01:43	<DarkX>	!uuid >	darkx
01:43	<magnetron>	Xyon, do you have proper graphic drivers installed?
01:43	<HYPOCRISY>	Hi
01:43	<elpargo>	Xyon, which compiz? be more specific please
01:43	<g35>	my server runs on port 443\
01:43	<hatredx`>	hi
01:43	<RypPn`>	hi
01:43	<MrMakeveli>	dcomsa, that looks a mlilion time better
01:43	<MrMakeveli>	i'll give it a try
01:43	<latoo>	bayziders: I mean, it's an Ubuntu specific site that hosts apps in deb format
01:43	<jasin>	I see ubuntu still hasn't fixed the synaptics touchpad problems
01:43	<mtm8>	eck: It isn't updating my environment variables
01:43	<eck>	atiredmachine: it is probably X locking up, which is probably a driver issue. I'm not sure there is much you can do
01:44	<Xyon>	compiz for gnome
01:44	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, could you try that with apt-get install and pastebin the error?
01:44	<variant>	jasin: works for me fine..
01:44	<g35>	i do host:443
01:44	<Xyon>	it wont replace my current x manager
01:44	<g35>	i get connection refused
01:44	<variant>	jasin: have you submitted a bug report?
01:44	<Xyon>	i believe i have the correct video drivers installed
01:44	<indecision>	jasin: the one where it hangs the pointer periodically?  I'm getting that on an old dell I put ubuntu on
01:44	<ubuntu>	When installing feisty off of the livecd, it fails at creating the ext3 filesystem with the message: "The ext3 file system creation in partition #2 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed."  any ideas as to what could have caused this, or how to fix it?  (I am using a Maxtor SATA drive).
01:44	<elpargo>	Xyon, is this the first time? which version of ubuntu?
01:44	<atiredmachine>	eck, thanks, I'm using nvidia.. is this likely to to be fixed at some point?
01:44	<HYPOCRISY>	I'll soon find out
01:44	<Xyon>	7.04
01:44	<hatredx`>	I'll think about it
01:44	<RypPn`>	no
01:44	<eck>	mtm8: there must be some bash option to clear them. do you need them to be cleared?
01:44	<elpargo>	Xyon, is that the "build in" one?
01:44	<Xyon>	this is the first time i've tried to start compiz and i'm on 7.04
01:44	<robbie_crash>	indecision, I think that told me where the drive is, cause it's on the second ide controller chip, on its second channel, and the other drive that's on that controller, on the other channel, is sda, and then my sata drive is sdc
01:44	<NemesisD>	jrib, is there a way just to set the driver rather than having to go through that whole reconfigure, i messed it up somewhere and broke X11, lol
01:45	<ajehuk>	I take it the host isnt running anything else on 443 (ie its the default https port...)
01:45	<elpargo>	Xyon, what video card you have?
01:45	<bayziders>	latoo: it is not there.
01:45	<jrib>	NemesisD: well you can try to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf directly
01:45	<eck>	atiredmachine: it would have to be fixed by nvidia. I suspect that if you ssh in after it locks up and look at the logs you will find some kernel messages about the nvidia driver misbehaving
01:45	<mtm8>	eck: Of course.
01:45	<Xyon>	ATI X700
01:45	<ajehuk>	g35 I take it the host isnt running anything else on 443 (ie its the default https port...)
01:45	<darx>	jrib: how can i check if dma is on?
01:45	<kitche>	elpargo: thbere is only one compiz right now since beryl hasn't switched over yet
01:45	<jasin>	variant, my touchpad works fine in windows, gparted live cd, partition magic boot disk, etc.. so its not my laptop its ubuntu.
01:45	<jrib>	!dma >	darx    (darx, see the private message from ubotu)
01:45	<mtm8>	eck: chroot'ing into something without updating environment variables is about as good as cd'ing to it.
01:45	<robbie_crash>	indecision, so I guess it must be sdb, but it's not loading, how can I figure out why not, or where to fix it?
01:45	<dcomsa>	Xyon: there's a little bit complicated with ati cards
01:45	<SaveFerris>	ok, so beryl gives my a big white useless screen on xubuntu feisty, so what session do i want to load? (failsafe gnome didn't work)
01:45	<jasin>	variant,  nice try blaming my system
01:45	<robbie_crash>	indecision, could it be a bunged up fs?
01:45	<Xyon>	i've gone through all the crap in the tuts
01:45	<latoo>	bayziders: not all apps get packaged for every distro. Check on the main website for the app, and ask around.
01:45	<gumjo>	I installed beryl on feisty with video card drivers, and while the effects work the title bar doesn't show....any help?
01:45	<Xyon>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingCompiz
01:46	<g35>	ajehuk: i can telnet fine into it and run it via my windows box
01:46	<elpargo>	kitche, that is not true. you could be running compiz that comes with 7.04 or the compiz deb packages that exist from before.
01:46	<Pupbuntoo>	hi, how do i install libdvdcss on feisty/64?
01:46	<indecision>	robbie_crash: you sure you're mounting the right partition on that disk?  and yes, it's entirely possible that the partition table or filesystem got messed up.
01:46	<Xyon>	gumjo: sounds like you need a window decorator
01:46	<NemesisD>	jrib, just change in the driver section the name vega?
01:46	<elpargo>	Xyon, and you have the ati propietary drivers?
01:46	<jrib>	NemesisD: you can /try/
01:46	<jasin>	indecision, yes, the mouse thats built in, the touchpad.
01:46	<magnetron>	Xyon: new info about ATI on feisty: http://www.mikesplanet.net/2007/04/installing-ubuntu-704-ati-x-cards/
01:46	<bayziders>	Latoo: well how do you install a scource package?
01:46	<ajehuk>	g35 - cool - OK i have a vnc server now running on port 443 and....
01:46	<elpargo>	Xyon, searhc for envy it's a script that will get you the correct drivers (not sure if it's updated for 7.04)
01:46	<SaveFerris>	is it possible to tell beryl to not load at startup from terminal?
01:46	<gumjo>	I have Emerald and Heliodor insstalled, both dont show up
01:46	<Xyon>	i dont know, i got my crap running by using sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
01:46	<Xyon>	correct?
01:46	<gumjo>	Envy is available for Feisty btw
01:46	<NemesisD>	jrib, ok and if it gets messed up, how does one restart x11 from bash?
01:46	<jrib>	SaveFerris: ~/.config/autostart/
01:47	<Madeye>	guys, I need to subscribe to comp.lang.python but I don't know any usenet client, any recommendation ?
01:47	<eck>	mtm8: look at the man page for env
01:47	<elpargo>	SaveFerris, beryl will never load at startup if you don't use that session
01:47	<jrib>	NemesisD: restore your backup and then 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start'
01:47	<latoo>	bayziders: look in the dir for an "INSTALL". That's where the instructions would be
01:47	<dcomsa>	Xyon: please join #ubuntu-effects. i think they are more experienced in this matter
01:47	<magnetron>	Xyon: new info about ATI on feisty: http://www.mikesplanet.net/2007/04/installing-ubuntu-704-ati-x-cards/ , the  ATI X... bug
01:47	<atiredmachine>	eck, what would I do to ssh in?  usually it only locks up for 5 seconds or so, but once it completely locked up.
01:47	<robbie_crash>	indecision, there's only one partition on the drive. Let me reboot again and see if I can figure anything out
01:47	<indecision>	robbie_crash: (un?)fortunately I haven't had to recover a damaged filesystem in linux yet, but there's lots of guides out there with advice on what to do
01:47	<samk>	anyone know how to get icon themes from gnome-look.com to work?
01:47	<Xyon>	thank you guys
01:47	<elpargo>	ahh good, thanks gumjo
01:47	<eck>	mtm8: i guess env -i bash as your shell
01:47	<bayziders>	Nope I listen the files there is a .c a .h a .server and a PKGBUILD file there are no text files all code.
01:47	<Ax4>	btw
01:47	<bayziders>	@latoo
01:47	<Ax4>	happy 420 people!
01:48	<magnetron>	i have got this strange issue: now and then when the computer starts up, it starts in 640x480 screen resolution. if I restart the X server with ctrl+alt+bkspace, it is normal (1280x1024@50Hz) again. How can make it start normal EVERY time?
01:48	<systemd0wn>	lol
01:48	<elpargo>	bayziders, dude you need a .deb file that is not a ubuntu package
01:48	<denicola>	Help needed, please! Feisty can't install grub properly because it identifies my hda as sdb (I also have a sata drive, identified as sda). Edgy had no problem with this: Grub was installed on hd0.
01:48	<eck>	atiredmachine: every once in a while the same thing happens on my computer (intel chip). If you are running sshd you can actually log in and usually you can shut down X and recover the machine
01:48	<Ax4>	university of florida wants to be a 'green' campus
01:48	<Ax4>	im like hellz yea!
01:48	<SaveFerris>	jrib: what do i do with ~/.config/autostart?
01:48	<indecision>	jasin: yeah, unfortunately I can't offer any advice on fixing it...bugs me too.  but hey, at least you're not alone :)
01:48	<jrib>	SaveFerris: look inside for a file that starts beryl
01:48	<bayziders>	elpargo it does not have to a ubuntu package to install it, you can install many types of packages in ubuntu.
01:48	<eck>	mtm8: and of course source a profile afterward
01:49	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, http://pastebin.ca/450624

01:49	<magnetron>	i have got this strange issue: now and then when the computer starts up, it starts in 640x480 screen resolution. if I restart the X server with ctrl+alt+bkspace, it is normal (1280x1024@50Hz) again. How can make it start normal EVERY time?
01:49	<g35>	ajehuk, ...howd it go?
01:49	<jasin>	indecision,  i just use an wireless mouse myself.
01:49	<indecision>	jasin: I wish I had one.  not worth buying on for this old thing, though... 500mhz and no wireless.  I just use it to tinker with.
01:49	<elpargo>	bayziders, that is not correct, you can only install deb files, you can run compiled code and you can even install manually but that may make your package manager unstable. Now if you do want to run that you will need to learn or search how to compile and run it.
01:49	<bacon_>	what/how do i blacklist drivers so feisty will use orinoco drivers for my ambit lan-express 802.11b card?
01:50	<barbarella_me>	denicola:can you pastebin your partition structure
01:50	<cedricshock>	Big, slightly off-topic question: If I interchange the two dimms in a computer, will that interchange the order of the memory addresses? Or does the bios just get to pick which one it wants to be first?
01:50	<SaveFerris>	jrib: cd ~/config./autostart so no such file or directory
01:50	<Vinitious>	now, gonna wait for the download, thnx for the help
01:50	<jrib>	SaveFerris: ~/.config/autostart/
01:50	<aimes>	why did the sudo aptitude update got stuck at 99%?
01:50	<Vinitious>	bye
01:50	<jasin>	indecision, I got mine for 10 bucks and its a laser mouse.
01:50	<g35>	ajehuk, sorry got booted, so what happened
01:50	<elpargo>	bayziders, I suggest you start by searching their website for instructions on how to build from source. if that is what you got
01:51	<samk>	anyone know how to get icon themes from gnome-look.com to work?
01:51	<eck>	bacon_: how is blacklisting them going to help you to use the card?
01:51	<variant>	jasin: what?
01:51	<ajehuk>	g35 hold on a moment...
01:51	<gumjo>	draq the archive to Theme Manager, Samk
01:51	<kitche>	cedricshock: the memory addresses are the same they just depend on the slot theya re in
01:51	<mtm8>	cedricshock: Good question, I'd be interested in an answer as well.
01:51	<eck>	samk: open up the theme manager and drag and drop the .tar.gz that you downloaded into it
01:51	<variant>	jasin: I sugested you open a bug report. I didn't blame anything
01:51	<latoo>	bayziders: if you read the instructions look for how to install in your /home dir so the app doesn't interfere with packaged apps
01:51	<bacon_>	is there a channel for wireless?
01:51	<benkong2>	bacon_: look in /etc/modules.d/
01:51	<samk>	theme prefernences?
01:51	<mtm8>	bacon_: #wireless
01:51	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, that seems like a packaging error, did you search launchpad for bugs on that package?
01:51	<eck>	samk: yeah
01:51	<samk>	preferences
01:52	<elpargo>	bacon_, yes it has 7
01:52	<magnetron>	i have got this strange issue: now and then when the computer starts up, it starts in 640x480 screen resolution. if I restart the X server with ctrl+alt+bkspace, it is normal (1280x1024@50Hz) again. How can make it start normal EVERY time?
01:52	<jasin>	variant, its not a bug its some sorta configuration problem, but anyways, I already did submit the problem to ubuntu.
01:52	<elpargo>	magnetron, repeating wont get you an answer noone here really knows we can only guesstimate
01:52	<variant>	jasin: that is what a bug is, why did you say i was "blaming your system"?
01:52	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, I have looked for the bug in wvdial, and found something about it frezzing in the autoconfig, but no solution at all
01:52	<arentoine>	Hello all, anyone know if the network icon next to the volume icon in festy is supposed to "blink"  to show some activity like the applet I'm used to have 6.10 ?
01:52	<tuesday>	is there anyway i can partition a section of my computer for ubuntu even though its got XP on it with he full hardrive taking that up
01:52	<cmcculloh>	magnetron, That happens to me when I don't have my screen turned on before I start the computer
01:53	<Haekke>	IS it easy to format ubuntu? I have additional disks in, can I just mount them again after a format?
01:53	<eck>	bayziders: usually something like: ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local will let you install into your homedir
01:53	<jasin>	variant, no its not.
01:53	<latoo>	tuesday: just boot from the live cd and use the partition editor
01:53	<_doppelganger_>	guys, lemme me know when you're not busy
01:53	<magnetron>	cmculloh: thank you! that is probably the issue.
01:53	<Newise>	Should Ubuntu 7.04 boot from SATA disks? Whatever I do, my computer boots to Windows and I do see any traces of Grub?
01:53	<elpargo>	tuesday, the program is call gparted is the same latoo is talking about
01:53	<variant>	_doppelganger_: what is your problem?
01:53	<indecision>	arentoine: this is just speculation on my part, but it might have to do with your particular network card.  it blinks on my laptop, but not on my deaktop.
01:53	<cmcculloh>	np ;)
01:53	<hyperspace>	can i kill a remote dist-upgrade (from gui)that gave up on fetching after max retries and restart with a dist-upgrade via console?
01:53	<jasin>	bugs are not configuration problems.
01:53	<NemesisD>	jrib, i think this computer doesn't like vega...
01:53	<tuesday>	ok what can i do if the live cd doesnt work?
01:53	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, how long ago was that?
01:53	<cedricshock>	kitche: So I have card A, with addresses 0-255, and card B with address 256-479, and I interchange the slots, then card B will have addresses 0-223, and A will have 224-479?

01:54	<tuesday>	ok i will give it a try
=== Jordan_U_ is now known as Jordan_U
01:54	<eck>	Newise: usus the grub-install command
01:54	<kitche>	cedricshock: yea since the slots determine the memory addresses
01:54	<jrib>	darx: I don't know
01:54	<_doppelganger_>	when i boot the ubuntu live cd, and go choose the erase full disk and install option

01:55	<variant>	_doppelganger_: with what error?
01:55	<Haekke>	IS it easy to format ubuntu? I have additional disks in, can I just mount them again after a format?
01:55	<cedricshock>	kitche: Excellent. Any idea why the system installed memory would be in the slot that ends up on top after adding another dimm?
01:55	<_doppelganger_>	every single time...  and i cannot understand why
01:55	<_doppelganger_>	i have tried to manually edit it and things, but to no avail
01:55	<_doppelganger_>	one sec, let me get the error

01:55	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, well then I guess you can only wait :) or try to fix the package.
01:55	<basim>	;lk;p
01:55	<kitche>	cedricshock: huh? usually the memory have to be in a certain slot for one stick
01:56	<tuesday>	ok wait one more thing should i continue to use the standard 32 bi edition or should i try 64 with my athlon 63 proccessor?
01:56	<jasin>	variant, i'm sorry but you just do not know what you are talking about, configuration files are not programs, software.
01:56	<tuesday>	*64
01:56	<Haekke>	Flannel: ok thanks sounds good. Think ill do that instead of a upgrade :D
01:56	<_doppelganger_>	variant: it's get to about 15%, then says it failed to format
01:56	<arentoine>	indecision : If this is true (wired doesn't show activity) it's too bad.  I'll have to put back the old applet then ...

01:57	<_doppelganger_>	that's a "off the top of my head" response, let me reboot and give it another shot
01:57	<ajehuk>	g35 - no that looks good
01:57	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, you know how I could fix it? I mean, how to modify a package?
01:57	<tuesday>	does the 64 work as well as the 32 on 7.04?
01:57	<jasin>	variant, Most bugs arise from mistakes and errors made by people in either a program's source code or its design, and a few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code.
01:57	<Whisperkiller>	finally got my hard drive to boot....silly me i had the jumper set wrong on it :P
01:57	<ajehuk>	g35 launched it in xterm as  xtightvncviewer 127.0.0.1::443

01:58	<arentoine>	Is anyone currently using Festy with a wired connection showing activity on their network icon (top right conner) ??
01:58	<_doppelganger_>	varient: will do
01:58	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, sadly is different for each one, maybe it's just a wrong URL it's trying to fetch and hangging there ....
01:58	<Whisperkiller>	variant i was in irc all day yesterday from the livecd because i was having an issue with my hard drive not booting
01:58	<darx>	libata sucks bigtime
01:58	<tuesday>	so i wont be able to use flash :-:
01:58	<NemesisD>	jrib, i was using the standard i8l0 but it didn't support the proper resolution for my monitor
01:58	<latoo>	arentoine: you mean network manager?
01:58	<darx>	i can't tweak my harddrive
01:58	<g35>	ajehuk, bueaty it was the :: i was using :
01:58	<variant>	Whisperkiller: good job
01:58	<g35>	thanks :-D
01:58	<jrib>	NemesisD: well try to see if the error happens with that one, just to trouble shoot
01:58	<eck>	darx: it could be the case that it does it by default now, how do you know it is doing 16 bit transfer?
01:58	<ajehuk>	g35 - no probs
01:59	<BeauGeste>	i have a problem getting kdm to start on boot with feisty
01:59	<barbarella_me>	_doppelganger_:what kind hd you have. ata, sata or scsi?
01:59	<arentoine>	latoo : I get so, it's currently in french
01:59	<samk>	whoever helped me it worked
01:59	<darx>	eck: thats what hdparm/sdparm says
01:59	<arentoine>	latoo : I gess so, it's currently in french
01:59	<gumjo>	when I try to run emerald in terminal it says: emerald: Could not acquire decoration manager selection on screen 0 display ":0.0"
01:59	<gumjo>	whats wrong?
01:59	<NemesisD>	jrib, okay and is it i8l0 (little L) or is it i810?
01:59	<latoo>	arentoine: the network manager is there by default, doesn't show activity. there's a separate monitor applet
01:59	<BeauGeste>	I reboot, it gets to command line, i have to reinstall the nvidia drivers and then retart kdm
01:59	<g35>	ajehuk, how do i do 256 colors?
02:00	<arentoine>	latoo : ok then ... this is somewhat misleading ...
02:00	<NemesisD>	nm i think i got it
02:00	<BeauGeste>	then it works until next reboot
02:00	<BeauGeste>	when i have to repeat the process
02:00	<darx>	eck: how can i revert to the normal ide drivers?
02:00	<Jordan_U>	BeauGeste, How did you install the nvidia driver?
02:00	<arentoine>	latoo : thanks for the info
02:00	<indecision>	so, does anyone know about Feisty (or heck, Edgy) and the ATI restricted drivers (Radeon 9700 Pro), and getting resolutions above 1152x864 to work?  I've had no luck.
02:00	<phealy>	So I've got the 7.04 livecd. I have a dell inspiron 6400, core 2 duo proc, ati radion x1300. when I boot the livecd, X segfaults. any suggestions?
02:00	<Alonea>	how do you blacklist a module?
02:00	<eck>	darx: i know there is a patch to make hdparm work with libata, i am not sure if it is applied in ubuntu
02:01	<AimeSiSolArt>	good night all
02:01	<AimeSiSolArt>	bye
02:01	<Jordan_U>	!blacklist | Alonea
02:01	<BeauGeste>	as in get to the command line and type sudo sh ./NVIDIA.......
02:01	<ubotu>	Alonea: To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add  blacklist <modulename>	 to the end of that list - To explicitly load modules in a specific order, list them in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and type  sudo update-initramfs -u 
02:01	<eck>	darx: nm, i think it was applied upstream already
02:01	<Alonea>	thanks Jordan_U, I could not remember where the file that I was supposed to edit was
02:02	<denicola>	<barbarella_me>	pastebin?
02:02	<hyperspace>	can i kill a remote dist-upgrade (from gui)that gave up on fetching after max retries and restart with a dist-upgrade via console?
02:02	<darx>	eck: hmm..thanks anyway.. i'll see if it helps..:)
02:02	<indecision>	phealy: I'd say it's either loading the wrong video driver, or you've got bad RAM.  if it's the driver, then installing ubuntu with the "alternate" CD might just work.  if it's the RAM, you'll want to replace it.
02:02	<variant>	BeauGeste: that is not the reccomended way to install the nvidia drivers
02:02	<variant>	!nvidia | BeauGeste
02:02	<ubotu>	BeauGeste: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
02:02	<Rkyraccoon55>	can somebody help me with desktop effects?
02:02	<phealy>	indecision: regular vesa driver, and the RAM's good according to memtest.
02:02	<Jordan_U>	BeauGeste, Did the drivers from the repositories not work? Did you blacklist the ones from the repositories?
02:02	<jasin>	indecision, have you tried the radeon drivers for linux? see: http://ati.amd.com/support/drivers/linux/linux-radeon.html
02:03	<variant>	BeauGeste: they should be installed with ubuntu package manager.. this will ensure they are set up correctly
02:03	<indecision>	jasin: I've only tried with the drivers offered by Feisty's restricted driver manager
02:03	<keithstabins>	exit
02:03	<darx>	eck: libata sucks nevertheless
02:03	<variant>	indecision: that is hte best way to install them

02:03	<ajehuk>	g35 I was going to say -depth but thet isnt doing anthing at this end....
02:03	<root__>	I can only get Ubuntu running by using grub to select recovery mode and then running startx, if I just let it boot normally, I get a black screen.   Any ideas?
02:03	<BeauGeste>	Jordan_U, no, its just i could not get the display manager up until i did this
02:04	<indecision>	variant: by the restricted manager, I assume you mean?
02:04	<BeauGeste>	variant, i will look at that
02:04	<variant>	indecision: you might have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf to add the extra resolutions
02:04	<bitmess>	What will convert DivX to DVD and burn it?
02:04	<variant>	indecision: yep
02:04	<g35>	ajehuk, hmmmm
02:04	<jasin>	indecision,  give them a try.
02:04	<eck>	darx: tell that to alan cox :-)
02:04	<Jordan_U>	BeauGeste, I mean, why did you install the drivers from Nvidia.com in the first place?
02:04	<variant>	BeauGeste: there is a dvd authoring program.. qtdvdauthor or something

02:05	<TokenBad>	no root system defined
02:05	<variant>	indecision: annoying. you can set the default resolution in xorg.conf and that should make the gui program irrelevent

02:06	<eck>	vustar: the author of libata and one of the kernel developers (he has a wikipedia article)

02:06	<jrib>	NemesisD: ah, that's kind of weird
02:06	<variant>	TokenBad: and that can't be ntfs/fat

02:06	<TokenBad>	variant, I have ext3 partition picked...
02:06	<Whisperkiller>	im selecting packages now but i wish there was a profile i could select under package installer
02:06	<Alonea>	Oh! Is the shutdown problems fixed in fiesty? The ones in relation to fglrx and ati video cards?
02:06	<vustar>	eck, ;)
02:06	<indecision>	variant: I'll give it a shot, I suppose.  I did try with a custom modeline, but it forced my monitor into 95hz, which it wasn't happy about.  Next time I feel like messing with it, I'll see if setting the default resolution works.
02:06	<ajehuk>	g35 - actually thats really wierd - the colour depth doesnt change regardless of what I set...
02:07	<_doppelganger_>	varient: would you rather me launch gparted and give you screenshots, or do the typical ubuntu install and show you the exact message? maybe gparted would shed some light on the situation
02:07	<NemesisD>	jrib, i know, that bums me out because i want to continue using beryl
02:07	<eck>	vustar: if you are interested https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks

02:07	<barbarella_me>	mtm8:yes you can automate commands, it depends from wich user you chroot
02:07	<latoo>	Haekke: there's a mini.iso (10MB) which installs over network

02:08	<NemesisD>	jesus why is totem even included with ubuntu, it can't play anything
02:08	<indecision>	ok, here's an easy Xchat question...can I get the join/part messages out of the channel window?
02:08	<variant>	_doppelganger_: run the installer (ubiquity) from a terminal with sudo and hopefully that will give some more output
02:08	<Pelo>	NemesisD,  you need the codecs
02:09	<Pelo>	!codecs >	NemesisD   check your pm window
02:09	<NemesisD>	Pelo, yeah i know, but its kinda silly that it can't play anything out of the box pretty much

02:09	<variant>	TokenBad: probably :)
02:09	<TokenBad>	like have something checked or unchecked
02:09	<indecision>	drew: which settings?
02:09	<Haekke>	Its not like its for a slow pc, I just see so many things that I dont need, games, office ect and maybe alot of other stuff (running servies for god knows what) which I dont need for running a file server
02:09	<Hubris>	<-- feeling dumb here....I've downloaded a .deb package that's older than what's installed....what's the syntax to force it to install?  The gui-based installer refuses...as it's older.
02:09	<BeauGeste>	how do you get to the restricted repositories from kubuntu?
02:09	<variant>	hyperspace: killall applicationname
02:09	<Pelo>	NemesisD,  it's not totem,s fault it's because of  canonical's policy toward proprietary software
02:09	<TokenBad>	variant, which is why said could do a sreenshot
02:09	<NemesisD>	oh
02:10	<NemesisD>	but blaming it on totem makes me feel like a big man

02:10	<variant>	hyperspace: now you know
02:10	<concept10>	ajehuk, what I primarily mean is Real Player and 32bit floating point .wav files
02:10	<NemesisD>	ok now this is bothering me, beryl seems to be preventing ANY video files from playing
02:10	<vustar>	why does https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyKnownIssues redirect to http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704 ?
02:11	<ajehuk>	NemesisD mpeg 2 is under patent so tht could be it...
02:11	<disinterested>	is there no way to get gnome-ppp package to get the modem configured on a new install?
02:11	<variant>	NemesisD: you need to set the default output plugin

02:11	<indecision>	drew: for the first one, if the setting in Edit->Preferences->Tabs doesn't do it for you, you might want to install an extension like Tabbrowser
02:11	<concept10>	If totem can't handle Real Player, my question is why the heck does it open them?
02:11	<Jordan_U>	!minimal | Haekke
02:11	<ubotu>	Haekke: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD

02:13	<lunar>	mp player cann't use
02:13	<NemesisD>	variant, ok i did that but it's still happening for some reason
02:13	<elpargo>	lunar, you will probably need the extra codecs  which player you have?
02:13	<kneeki>	variant, Ahh. Ok! Do I have to have an account already on that PC, or can I just type in whatever?

02:13	<knix_>	How does nxserver work?
02:13	<variant>	kneeki: you need a user account on the remote system
02:13	<eck>	retry: i don't know much about alsa, but maybe you could use alsactl to save the configuration in xubuntu and then try using it to reload that configuration in ubuntu?
02:14	<denicola>	Help needed, please! Feisty can't install grub properly because it identifies my hda as sdb (I also have a sata drive, identified as sda). Edgy had no problem with this: Grub was installed on hd0.
02:14	<Dante123>	what is the md5sum for the 7.04 i386 regular
02:14	<ajehuk>	concept10 - cant say Ive had that troube but that may have more to do with the websites I use :)
02:14	<Pelo>	lunar,  the default audio player in ubuntu is rhythmbox,  but you sill need to add the mp3 support
02:14	<kneeki>	variant, Ah, okay. Thanks for the info!
02:14	<retry>	eck, but the prob is before alsa
02:14	<retry>	the card is not getting detected by the system on boot

02:14	<lunar>	how to do this
02:14	<retry>	no such prob in xubuntu
02:14	<NemesisD>	variant, ok ill do that, sec
02:14	<ajehuk>	concept10 - cant say I have had any issue with mime-types either actually..
02:14	<variant>	NemesisD: it's nothing to do with beryl
02:14	<eck>	retry: doesn't xubuntu load the same kernel?
02:14	<Pelo>	BeauGeste,   have you tried asking in #kubuntu ,  they are more familiar with the kde ins and outs then we are here
02:14	<retry>	eck, that's what I assume

02:16	<ubuntu_noob>	hello, just a simple question.. how do I set mplayer as the default player ?
02:16	<eck>	retry: well i am mystified
02:16	<variant>	snowpunk98: ln -sf /usr/bin/vlc /usr/bin/totem (WILL COMPLETELY REPLACE TOTEM WITH VLC UNTILL YOU NEXT UPDATE THE SYSTEM)
02:16	<Pelo>	snowpunk98,  borked  dvd maybe ?   you can change the default player in  system >	prets >	removable media
02:16	<elpargo>	snowpunk98, ahh yes go to the file type in nautilus click properties then openwith
02:16	<elpargo>	variant, WTF! are you mad
02:16	<ajehuk>	variant - lol that will work but is that really the best way?
02:16	<denicola>	IDE drive mistaken for SCSI...
02:16	<eck>	variant: you've got to be kidding me
02:17	<retry>	eck, it makes me wonder if there is some bug in ubu feisty
02:17	<nowisn>	help installing ubuntu, I have a unallocated space of 51 gig but i'm not sure how to set it up, i'm in the prepare partions window of ubuntu now??
02:17	<variant>	elpargo: no, there is no system wide way to set the default player for all apps. it's a pita to do it one by one so that way works fine
02:17	<elpargo>	of course it will work but it's a stupid morronic thing to do
02:17	<variant>	elpargo: why?
02:17	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: don't listen to him
02:17	<nowisn>	can someone pm if possible for help
02:17	<variant>	elpargo: give me one good reason why that is a bad idea?
02:17	<eck>	retry: the fact that it doesn't work isn't too surprising, there are a number of bugs for feisty in LP, but the fact that it would work in xubuntu is beyond me
02:17	<Pelo>	retry,  we know there are bugs in fiesty,  the fun is figureing out where they are
02:17	<ajehuk>	nowisn - what would you like to know?
02:17	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, don't listen to whom ?
02:17	<elpargo>	variant, then that means ubuntu needs a widget to change that but making your system like that is not good.
02:18	<lunar>	what i need to do  to play the mp3files?
02:18	<variant>	elpargo: of course it's not ideal. it is certainly not moronic though. you just didn't think about it before saying that.
02:18	<elpargo>	variant, well lets start by breaking totem, second it's not permanent, and third is misleading
02:18	<Jordan_U>	variant, Because automated things will try to pass arguments to mplayer thinking it's totem
02:18	<moDumass>	!xorg.conf
02:18	<ubotu>	The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type  sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
02:18	<variant>	Jordan_U: name one
02:18	<elpargo>	variant, no that's stupid and you shouldn't give out that advice to people that don't know what their are doing
02:18	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: right-click on a media file and choose too always open the file with the player of your choice
02:19	<variant>	elpargo: idealy it would be better to have a /usr/bin/mediaplayer that was a symlink to your prefered player
02:19	<ajehuk>	elpargo - does what was asked though - someone with more of a GUI method should offer analternative tho
02:19	<variant>	elpargo: not at all
02:19	<nowisn>	its saying i need to allocate space for a swap and 2 gig for primary
02:19	<nowisn>	does this not create it on its own
02:19	<snowpunk98>	variant, Thank you that did it and VLC looks a lot better
02:19	<Jordan_U>	variant, The gnome whatever that plays removable media like DVD's when inserted
02:19	<variant>	elpargo: if you can offer an alternative that isin't laborious and annoying please do
02:19	<Jordan_U>	variant, It will pass "%M" to mplayer
02:19	<elpargo>	variant, no ideally they will add an entry to update-alternatives if that is what you mean
02:19	<magnetron>	snowpunk98: right-click on a media file and choose too always open the file with the player of your choice
02:19	<variant>	snowpunk98: good job, note the dislike for the idea from others though. remember you wil lhave to redo it next time you update
02:19	<eck>	nowisn: you cannot install ubuntu if you have not given it any space to install to
02:20	<underwatercow>	is there a better partitioner available other than gparted?
02:20	<underwatercow>	:-p
02:20	<eck>	nowisn: hence the request for 2 GB of space
02:20	<mike123>	how do i install ati drivers
02:20	<variant>	Jordan_U: mplayer is not even part of the quesiton or solution so what are you meaning?
02:20	<elpargo>	variant, change each file, it's a one time thing while your will break a lot
02:20	<variant>	ahh.. batter dead :/ finnish arg next time :)
02:20	<variant>	elpargo: it wont break ANYTHING
02:20	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, doesn't have that option ? isn't that the m$ feature= =?
02:20	<snowpunk98>	Eh so
02:20	<snowpunk98>	sok
02:20	<eck>	underwatercow: of course, it's called fdisk ;-)
02:20	<snowpunk98>	Ill just redo it when I update
02:20	<variant>	elpargo: except totem, which he doesn't want anyway
02:20	<snowpunk98>	no biggie
02:20	<elpargo>	variant, yes it will Jordan_U just told you
02:20	<underwatercow>	eck: lol, that's not funny

02:21	<Jordan_U>	variant, s/mplayer/totem/g
02:21	<Jestre>	Do I need to have special drivers to allow the Feisty CD to boot if I have an ATI video card?
02:21	<variant>	Jordan_U: ok
02:21	<jrib>	NemesisD: try mplayer -vo x11  and see if it still crashes
02:21	<Jordan_U>	variant, s/mplayer/vlc/g ;)
02:21	<elpargo>	variant, and you said it yourself it will break next time you update totem
02:21	<ajehuk>	nowisn : what eck said, althogh if you have 51G of free space that should be showing - are there any partitions listed of that size?
02:21	<kalifornia909>	can someone help me with a software raid install
02:21	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: you shouldn't...
02:21	<johnsonwe>	Can anybody recommend a channel for getting wireless setup on feisty fawn?
02:21	<elpargo>	variant, just don't mislead people ok
02:21	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: i use the swedish ubuntu, but is called somethin like "preferences"
02:21	<ajehuk>	johnsonwe - this one.
02:21	<Jordan_U>	johnsonwe, Right here :)
02:22	<eck>	underwatercow: i think gparted/qtparted are just graphical interfaces for fdisk/mkfs anyway, so i don't know how they would be made much better
02:22	<jrib>	NemesisD: (and try other -vo stuff if it does)
02:22	<Jordan_U>	johnsonwe, What card?
02:22	<ciscosurfer>	johnsonwe: have you checked Ubuntu Forums for some answers?
02:22	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Thanks...  X won't display when I boot and try to install
02:22	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: there is a tab called "open with"
02:22	<_lemsx1_>	can somebody tell me what nvidia_new is used for? (driver)

02:22	<underwatercow>	eck: isn't fdisk a dos program? lol
02:22	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, but it doesn't set as default tho...

02:22	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: can you get to a command line?
02:22	<nowisn>	okay so now i clicked on create new partion, do i create as primary and use ext3??
02:22	<cellojoe>	thanks jrib
02:22	<boricua>	after several years i still find the default theme ugly super ugly why has ubuntu  kept it for so many years like that.....  i mean the distro is great but this brown color looks like ups :-)
02:22	<ajehuk>	underwatercow - not in this case. no
02:22	<elpargo>	underwatercow, no fdisk was copied by dos
02:23	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: in that tab, you can MAKE IT default
02:23	<johnsonwe>	I'm running kubuntu on a Dell XPS M1210 laptop. Wireless works fine on home network, but not at work, where PEAP is in use.  that's what I need help with

02:23	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: No
02:23	<elpargo>	underwatercow, in fact windows fdisks blows compared to unix
02:23	<eck>	underwatercow: it is a unix command, i'd imagine that it predates the windows version as well
02:23	<_lemsx1_>	Jordan_U: thanks
02:23	<koala>	when apache is installed, where is the main web directory located (sorry if nub question)
02:23	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Laptop has Edgy on it now, and I could get to that one, but I want to do a clean install

02:23	<koala>	ty
02:23	<moDumass>	any ideas
02:23	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: what happens when you hit the key combo CTRL-ALT-F1 (or F1 thru F6....F7 will bring you back to default)
02:24	<underwatercow>	eck, elpargo: the one thing I like about Vista is it's partitioner... You can expand or shrink volumes easily
02:24	<eck>	elpargo: exactly, what more could you ask for?
02:24	<ajehuk>	johnsonwe - ah one of the easy wireless questions... :) - gve me a moment
02:24	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: not rightclick>open with , rightclick >	PREFERENCES >open with
02:24	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: That's what I tried, nothing happens
02:24	<koala>	is there a way to install it locally to a /home/users directory like, public_html folder?
02:24	<kalifornia909>	that raid link is for people with linux installed already
02:24	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: hmmm...
02:24	<latoo>	underwatercow: Ubuntu has gparted which does the same
02:24	<elpargo>	underwatercow, ehh I'm sorry to say this but UNIX had that YEARS ago.
02:24	<kalifornia909>	i want to install to a raid array
02:24	<Flannel>	koala: yeah.  Make ~/public_html and put stuff there
02:24	<eck>	underwatercow: i have not used it, how does it differ from the same functionality in gparted?
02:24	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: If I change the F4-VGA to something unusual, I'll eventually get an Xserver crashed message
02:24	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: have you tried an alternate install CD?
02:24	<Flannel>	koala: then browse to http://whatever/~username
02:24	<seven5_>	hi guys, i just threw fiesty on my asus pundit barebones with a geforce 6 card on board, and used automatix to install vlc, and i can't get it to play any videos, xvid or mkv. Is there anything known about this problem? is there a common workaround or anything, or am i a special case.....
02:24	<magnetron>	!vista
02:24	<ubotu>	vista is the new operating system by the evil overlords from Redmond. For more information, see http://www.badvista.org
02:24	<underwatercow>	I had issues with gparted complaining about everything being mounted
02:24	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, ah... right click open as ^^?
02:25	<xiven>	Hello
02:25	<jorge_>	is there like an official howto on getting vmware server running on feisty?
02:25	<xiven>	Has anyone tried using Gaim on Feisty?
02:25	<elpargo>	seven5_, yes automatix sucks
02:25	<ajehuk>	johnsonwe - how are you currently configuring your wireless?
02:25	<nowisn>	do i create my primary partion as filesyst ext3???
02:25	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: interesting...
02:25	<underwatercow>	I just set up vmware today
02:25	<Jack3>	hi guys
02:25	<elpargo>	xiven, runing here...
02:25	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: not rightclick>open as , rightclick >	PREFERENCES >open as
02:25	<eck>	underwatercow: of course, i doubt the vista installer lets you shrink a mounted FS
02:25	<sdfasdfawef>	xiven: works fine for me
02:25	<latoo>	underwatercow: you should not resize partitions while they're mounted :-) do it from the live cd
02:25	<jorge_>	underwatercow, server?
02:25	<xiven>	hmm
02:25	<ajehuk>	nowisn yep
02:25	<Flannel>	koala: Uh, the apache module that does that is enabled by default in dapper and edgy.  I'm unsure about feisty.  But it is most likely enabled
02:25	<_lemsx1_>	Jordan_U: nvidia_new is for anything newer than geforce4 ?
02:25	<seven5_>	elpargo: any suggestions ?
02:25	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Not yet... never had an issue, was wondering if something were different about these.. Kubuntu herd installed on my other one without issue
02:25	<xiven>	everytime i send a message on it, it crashes
02:25	<Jack3>	so its true ubuntu has NTFS read/write?
02:25	<boricua>	on the console where do i see all the pkgs installed
02:25	<underwatercow>	can you unmount a drive you are using though?
02:25	<tmbg37>	hi, I was wondering if anyone's been able to get a belkin 802.11g card or other rt61 device working on feisty
02:25	<jrib>	Jack3: yes, if you isntall ntfs-3g
02:25	<Flannel>	Jack3: in feisty, yes.  You just have to enable it
02:25	<johnsonwe>	ajehuk - I'll check back in - something came up here.  Later!
02:25	<elpargo>	seven5_, get rid of automatix and use the real package manager.
02:25	<Jack3>	thats pretty cool
02:25	<magnetron>	boricua: aptitude
02:25	<ajehuk>	Jack3 yeap, not sure how stable it is att
02:25	<eck>	underwatercow: no
02:25	<xiven>	It has a "core dump"..
02:25	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, wait... there's no open as in preference
02:25	<seven5_>	elpargo: ok i'll give it a go
02:26	<jorge_>	Flannel, enable it by installing ntfs-3g?
02:26	<eck>	underwatercow: you would use a live cd or run it from another partition
02:26	<underwatercow>	eck: so how would I resize my linux partition?
02:26	<Jack3>	hmm, its not that crap where you have to replace a blank file to write to it , is it?
02:26	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: if you click a media file it is
02:26	<underwatercow>	eck: ok, makes sense
02:26	<underwatercow>	eck: thanks
02:26	<ajehuk>	johnsonwe - kk
02:26	<koala>	and 1 last thing (i hope) :) -- what is the correct term \ command to install a media player software, for winam
02:26	<koala>	winamp* movie sort of buzz?
02:26	<eck>	underwatercow: the ubuntu install cd has gparted on it, so you can just use that one
02:26	<latoo>	underwatercow: just reboot with the live cd, partition manager is in the menu
02:26	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, lolz

02:26	<kalifornia909>	anyone install to blank raid array
02:26	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: so here's what I suggest then (if Kubuntu was able to install okay)...install Kubuntu Feisty from CD and then add the ubunt-desktop package (that will pull in Gnome, etc.)....see if that works for you
02:26	<xiven>	stuff like that is what it says when it crashes
02:26	<elpargo>	koala, winamp doesn't exists in unix,
02:27	<boricua>	magnetron: is there a way to just ls all the pkgs or another way without jusing an app
02:27	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - are you talking software raid or actual hardware?
02:27	<magnetron>	boricua: aptitude
02:27	<koala>	i know, i mean like a media player\music player like it, ii think the codecs maybe
02:27	<ciscosurfer>	jestre: meant ubuntu-desktop NOT ubunt-desktop
02:27	<underwatercow>	eck, latoo: if I use the live CD, gparted will see my drives automatically?
02:27	<_lemsx1_>	Jordan_U: disregard my question. i found the answer
02:27	<elpargo>	koala, google for audio players they are 100s
02:27	<Flannel>	jorge_: no... uh, some other package.  ntfs-config, I believe.
02:27	<latoo>	underwatercow: yes
02:27	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Okay...  otherwise I can do a normal upgrade via the upgrade-manager if I have to
02:27	<underwatercow>	latoo: awesome, thanks...
02:27	<jorge_>	Flannel, ok, cool.
02:27	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Just that this'll be the third upgrade like that on this machine, and I wanted to start fresh
02:27	<elpargo>	koala, xmms is old but it resembles winamp3 although currently they are much better alternatives
02:27	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Thanks for the ideas
02:27	<koala>	for example? :)
02:28	<eck>	xiven: if you are feeling ambitious you can try to strace it and see what is crashing it
02:28	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: if you do an upgrade, then read the documentation that ubuntu.com has provided...it explains the correct process you should follow to upgrade successfully
02:28	<underwatercow>	Has anyone else noticed that most of Vista's new features are from Linux and Mac, but implemented in a worse way?
02:28	<jorge_>	anyone have a nice howto on getting vmware server working under feisty?
=== koala is now known as koaL
02:28	<elpargo>	koala, google it :)
02:28	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: sure! any time!
02:28	<boricua>	magnetron: i dont like apititude is there another way i can look like thru a dir
02:28	<eck>	xiven: probably one of the libraries it is using is borked, since it works for me
02:28	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Yeah, about the same as the Dapper ->	Edgy upgrade I did on it
02:28	<underwatercow>	jorge_: it's not too hard, I can tell you how
02:28	<xiven>	HAH
02:28	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Thanks again
02:28	<xiven>	Figured it out
02:28	<xiven>	IT was "sounds"
02:28	<jorge_>	underwatercow: I'm listening
02:28	<elpargo>	koaL, no tons of articles comparing them on google.
02:28	<mastroDani>	hi there, i've upgraded Ubuntu to feisty yesterday: during the installation it tried to configure MD Array (RAID) on my laptop (???). at the end i rebooted and i found a black screen.. the nvidia proprietary driver didn't work anymore. no way to get them work.. i temporary switched to "nv" driver waiting a solution.. plus the system is became very slow: the load of the system it's always more then 2 and often go to
02:28	<mastroDani>	5..... (even if i only install something through apt-get).. plus my hard drive was in /dev/hda.. now it is in /dev/sda.. it's not a SCSI disk.. so why this happened? i didn't like this!
02:28	<latoo>	boricua: look through a dir?
02:28	<underwatercow>	jorge_: it's going to be a quick lesson though as I need to go
02:28	<magnetron>	boricua: aptitude is curses-based
02:28	<xiven>	Obviously its caling aplay to play the sounds was screwing up all kinds of stuff, causing a crash
02:29	<jorge_>	underwatercow, shot
02:29	<nibsa1242>	Hello, I need some help. My computer hardlocked during upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04. Upon reboot it says:
02:29	<koaL>	cheers guys, much appreciated
02:29	<jorge_>	*shoot
02:29	<underwatercow>	you want the server, right?
02:29	<boricua>	latoo: yeah like ls /var/something
02:29	<jorge_>	underwatercow, yup
02:29	<xiven>	I feel smart now hehe
02:29	<underwatercow>	jorge_: You have to download the server from the website
02:29	<ajehuk>	koaL - for audio amarok is nice for video gxine is quite nice (but now people will disagree with me..)
02:29	<xiven>	I figured it out in 5 minutes
02:29	<nibsa1242>	waiting for root file system... .... ALERT /dev/sda5 does not exist. Dropping to a shell!
02:29	<magnetron>	boricua: other alternative is "man apt-get"
02:29	<covOPprometheus>	has anyone solved problems with wvdial in feisty??
02:29	<underwatercow>	jorge_: extract it and run the script
02:29	<koaL>	time 2 restart, thanks aje ;)
02:29	<eck>	mastroDani: remove the splash and quiet option from the grub line, boot it up, and see what is taking it so long
02:29	<latoo>	boricua: not sure what you want but try "apt-get search foo"
02:29	<xiven>	Feisty has Officially came out, correct?
02:29	<Flannel>	xiven: correct
02:29	<eck>	xiven: yes
02:29	<nibsa1242>	and then BusyBox c.1.1.3 .... Duilt in shell (ash)
02:29	<xiven>	Good.
02:29	<magnetron>	!feisty >	xiven
02:30	<jorge_>	underwatercow: ....I know, but I want to use feisty's vmware server modules
02:30	<underwatercow>	jorge_: when you run the config script, it'll probably have an error
02:30	<xiven>	Would you IRc people stop with the bot commands
02:30	<kbrooks>	xiven, no.
02:30	<neilmorrow>	hi all
02:30	<mastroDani>	eck, it is not taking long on boot time.. it have an high load when i'm into the system
02:30	<xiven>	LOL
02:30	<jorge_>	underwatercow: ok, keep going..
02:30	<underwatercow>	jorge_: isn't that what I'm explaining?
02:30	<xiven>	I wrote a Chat Server in Python
02:30	<underwatercow>	jorge_: lol
02:30	<boricua>	k
02:30	<kbrooks>	xiven, we are addicted to bots.
02:30	<xiven>	Actually, ive written a chat server in C++,Java,Python,C#
02:30	<mastroDani>	eck, i think that something has gone horribly wrong during the update
02:31	<nowisn>	is the root partion the same as the primary???
02:31	<nibsa1242>	I just need some help... how do I fix my upgrade?
02:31	<underwatercow>	jorge_: if it has an error when you run the config, you'll probably have to download the vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
02:31	<neilmorrow>	anyone running 7.04 on apple hardware?
02:31	<eck>	mastroDani: check your log files, esp /var/log/messages
02:31	<xiven>	Im still not sure If i know enough of any of those to help in the Open Source world though
02:31	<mava>	Hola necesito ayuda.... alguien disponible?
02:31	<J-_>	Just install feisty, and man.. the sources list is already messed up. I cannot download any packages I want, just used source-o-matic to try and fix the problem and the PGP keys, I don't know how to add, it shows an example. But, it says the keys won't go in.
02:31	<Rug>	nowisn: no
02:31	<magnetron>	!doesn't work | nibsal242
02:31	<ubotu>	nibsal242: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
02:31	<underwatercow>	jorge_:It has a runme.pl script that will fix the errors and let it install correctly
02:31	<Jenn>	how do I edit my grub boot load manager in ubuntu?
02:31	<eck>	mastroDani: also, the renaming of the disk was the change to libata, see this for details https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks
02:31	<elpargo>	xiven, either that's bull or your really tristed...
02:31	<Gabz>	is there a vm image of 7.04 out yet ?
02:31	<radioaktivstorm>	evening, im having all sorts of fun errors on my machine. (1) how can i get kde to stop overriding my gnome settings? I dont like kde and would like to be able to change my theme as i please. (2)  does anyone know of any reason why i would no longer be able to add users to my system?
02:31	<ajehuk>	neilmorrow - nah It wont run on my powerbook
02:31	<magnetron>	!grub | Jenn
02:31	<ubotu>	Jenn: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
02:31	<elpargo>	mava, si pero en ingles :)
02:32	<jorge_>	underwatercow: ummm ok
02:32	<ajehuk>	neilmorrow - but then maybe I need something a bit more beefy than a 1400....
02:32	<elpargo>	Jenn, /boot if you know what your doing
02:32	<underwatercow>	jorge_: did that all make sense?
02:32	<jorge_>	yes
02:32	<Jenn>	magnetron, where do I type that?
02:32	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - where are you configuring your raid then?
02:32	<underwatercow>	jorge_: I used all defaults in the install and it worked fine
02:32	<J-_>	have any suggestions on my problem?
02:32	<jorge_>	underwatercow: I was reading a forum post with that info too
02:32	<elpargo>	radioaktivstorm, get rid of kde?
02:32	<exs_>	frostwire in the repos crashes for me after i enter the chat channel, why is this?
02:32	<mava>	mmm que nal... bueno gracias igualmente "elpargo"
02:32	<Rug>	nowisn: Primary partitions and Logical partitions are "physical" methods to dividing the space on a hard-drive
02:32	<nibsa1242>	Can any one help me. My update failed and my root partition can not be found (it says "does not exist") I'm at a command line with (initramfs)
02:32	<magnetron>	!grub  Jenn
02:32	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about grub  jenn - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
02:32	<magnetron>	!grub >	Jenn
02:33	<underwatercow>	mmmmmm grub....
02:33	<seven5_>	elpargo: ok so that didn't fix it, theres something wrong with the video card i think, cause mplayer is reporting that there is an error selecting the video_out device... vlc opens, and looks to play the video, but its all black. And when i move the video window the screen tears, like just gets all messed up from teh vlc window
02:33	<neilmorrow>	ajehuk - i have a g4 ibook that i'm deeply considering dual booting
02:33	<J-_>	!sources
02:33	<boricua_>	very strange i just closed evolution and it closed xchat, firefox as well
02:33	<ubotu>	The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
02:33	<Jenn>	I just want to delete some of the old kernel that is listed on my grub screen....
02:33	<sldkfj>	I've got a good question;  Why does Ubuntu include the most drab fonts?
02:33	<radioaktivstorm>	elpargo, does that get rid of the permanent theme issue? cool, ill do it
02:33	<elpargo>	mava, /join #ubuntu-es
02:33	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - so you are configuring a single raid device that uses bot hdisks as raid0 - correct?
02:33	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - so you are configuring a single raid device that uses bot hdisks as raid0 - correct?/msg
02:33	<sldkfj>	and there are so many of them............. sheesh
02:33	<Kamaria>	Good evening
02:33	<nowisn>	is the root partion the same as the primary???
=== Haekke is now known as Quads
02:33	<mava>	elpargo muchas gracias por el dato
02:33	<bitmess>	Anyone here hate Vista?
02:33	<nibsa1242>	Jenn: old kernels don't take up much space
02:33	<Kamaria>	I got a problem again. XD
02:34	<latoo>	sldkfj: so install the fonts you like
02:34	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, muhahaha found the solution here: /usr/share/applications/defaults.list :P
02:34	<sldkfj>	the same fonts it's either sans/serif/ or mono
02:34	<Pie-rate>	have there been any problems upgrading to feisty? will it break anything?
02:34	<gumjo>	oti
02:34	<Kamaria>	How do I generate a new menu.lst file?
02:34	<ajehuk>	nowisn - not sure what you mean by that...
02:34	<nibsa1242>	My feisty upgrade caused a hard lock
02:34	<sldkfj>	latoo, yeah, why should it be like windows
02:34	<boricua_>	i see a lot of users with suffix _ after there name meaning xchat crashed on them anyone knows why xchat is crashing
02:34	<elpargo>	seven5_, ummm normally when I get that the video is corrupted or I didn't finish downloading, happens a lot with torrent files that I preview
02:34	<sldkfj>	I gotcha
02:34	<eck>	Kamaria: what is wrong with the current one? usually you would just make changes to that
02:34	<sldkfj>	makes sense to me.........
02:34	<elpargo>	seven5_, mostly wmv
02:34	<nibsa1242>	now my root part doesn not exist after fiesty upgrade
02:34	<latoo>	if you like windows fonts "sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts"
02:34	<nibsa1242>	and no one is helping me
02:34	<seven5_>	elpargo: nah, thats not it , i now for sure these work
02:34	<ajehuk>	nowisn 0 if you mean primary / logical partition then that has nothing to do with your root (/) filesystem as such
02:34	<sooti>	hi I enabled desktop effects in feisty and titlebar dissapeared
02:34	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, thanks for the help... highly appreciated
02:34	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob, great now YOU have to hang around here answering the same question over and over again =)
02:35	<nowisn>	ubuntu is asking me to create a primary &swap and root partions
02:35	<eck>	nibsa1242: are you mounting by uuid?
02:35	<elpargo>	radioaktivstorm, hehe ok although I said that as a joke
02:35	<radioaktivstorm>	elpargo, lol i was gonna do it anyway
02:35	<elpargo>	seven5_, format?
02:35	<kalifornia909>	 does anyone have a nforce raid chipset
02:35	<seven5_>	elpargo: an xvid and an mkv
02:35	<kalifornia909>	!raid 0
02:35	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about raid 0 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
02:35	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - but you are seeing two drives in ubuntu?
02:35	<Kamaria>	eck: I know, but I don't want to mess up. I did a whole lot of messing around with partitions and I'd prefer something do it automatically.
02:35	<elpargo>	radioaktivstorm, great getting rid of that is good :) make sure to uninstall kubuntu-desktop package
02:35	<seven5_>	elpargo: no video player will play them, but whats wierd is the error from mplayer, and the screen tearing from vlc
02:35	<Jenn>	on my grub boot loader - they is kernel generic and kernel 386. What's the deal here?
02:35	<fiction>	!codec
02:36	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
02:36	<radioaktivstorm>	elpargo, excellent.
02:36	<boricua>	!java
02:36	<ubotu>	To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
02:36	<nowisn>	i created a primary ext3 and a 512 swap partion, this is all i should need
02:36	<ryanakca>	why can't I access my box after going 'sudo iptables -F'?
02:36	<elpargo>	seven5_, ummm maybe they have copy protection?
02:36	<elpargo>	seven5_, run the file utility on them
02:36	<seven5_>	elpargo: no, i have played them millions of times, these arent new files
02:36	<Jenn>	on my grub boot loader - there is kernel generic and kernel 386. What's the deal here? Only Kernel generic works for me.
02:36	<Kamaria>	Okay, here's a different question.
02:36	<magnetron>	!firewall >	ryanakca
02:36	<Pie-rate>	been thinking about trying devorak
02:36	<fiction>	Whenever i click a link in here, bluefish opens up. how do i make it so it opens up with firefox?
02:36	<Pie-rate>	dvorak*
02:36	<eck>	Kamaria: as long as you keep the old entries in it, you'll be fine
02:36	<cables>	Are there any disadvantages to using sun-java6-jre instead of sun-java5-jre?
02:37	<sooti>	anyone else have problems with compiz?
02:37	<elpargo>	seven5_, did they just stop working???
02:37	<boricua>	the bot topics have they been uptaded for 7.04 or still on edgy
02:37	<cables>	Pie-rate, I use dvorak, after a week or two it feels natural.
02:37	<Kamaria>	How do I move my MBR from one disc to the other?
02:37	<radioaktivstorm>	elpargo, would you happen to have any idea why i cannot add another desktop user to my computer? i just upgrated to fiesty this afternoon...there were a few errors
02:37	<eck>	Kamaria: because you would just be able to boot up with the old settings and fix any mistakes you made
02:37	<Kamaria>	Hard disc, that is.
02:37	<elpargo>	cables, most programs haven't been tested enough other then that no it's performance is great
02:37	<kalifornia909>	will gparted set a raid array ubuntu will recognize
02:37	<latoo>	sooti: everyone has problems with compiz, it's alpha
02:37	<Pie-rate>	i'd need to take my damn keyboard apart though =/
02:37	<cables>	Pie-rate, I didn't notice typing speed improvements, but i didn't have sore hands as often
02:37	<ryanakca>	magnetron: that doesn't help me.
02:37	<cables>	Pie-rate, no, just do it in software
02:37	<Jenn>	on my grub boot loader - there is kernel generic and kernel 386. What's the deal here? Only Kernel generic works for me. Should I remove kernel 386?
02:37	<elpargo>	radioaktivstorm, well errors happen :)
02:37	<eck>	Kamaria: you can't do that (well you _can_ but don't want to) because hte MBR stores the partition table
02:37	<Pie-rate>	then the key labels will be wrong
02:38	<cables>	Pie-rate, it's actually easier to learn if you're forced to not look at the keys...
02:38	<ryanakca>	magnetron: I don't have a monitor on my server, and I can't ssh into it. network on it is dead. how do I recover? pull the plug?
02:38	<Pie-rate>	orly?
02:38	<cables>	Pie-rate, but you're planning to learn to touch-type on Dvorak anyway, it shouldn't matter
02:38	<cables>	elpargo, thank you
02:38	<magnetron>	ryanakca: maybe you accidently made a rule to prohibit network traffic...
02:38	<seven5_>	elpargo: no, this is the first time i've actually even installed a gui onto this computer, it used to just be a server, its got an nforce chipset and a geforce 6 card on board. the video files have been played tons on other computers and my xbmc
02:38	<latoo>	ryanakca: serial cable? :-)
02:38	<boricua>	ryanakca: hit the monitor with a bat
02:38	<break_>	is there a place where i could download feisty at least a little faster than 100 KB/sec??
02:38	<cables>	break_, bittorrent
02:38	<ryanakca>	magnetron: sudo iptables -F         flushes all the iptables rules
02:38	<break_>	the tracker times out
02:39	<shoot^>	fellas, i have a Sony Erricson w810i, and under windows i tend to back up all my text messages etc to my pc. is there any software that lets you do stuff like that on linux?
02:39	<magnetron>	ryanakca: don't know if it will reset the filters on reboot
02:39	<elpargo>	ryanakca, well that is not a server :) and I suggest you attach a monitor cause that's the only way your getting into that box.
02:39	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - good thats the hardware doing the raid...
02:39	<cables>	break_, use uTorrent in Wine or Azureus and you don't need a tracker.
02:39	<Kamaria>	eck: Okay then, lol. What I'm trying to do right now is install Windows on the other hard disk, but I read on a forum that Windows tends not to like Linux's boot information and well...the install process crashes every time I try to boot from CD.
02:39	<elpargo>	break_, you are aware of how many people are trying to get that? 100kb is supper fast right now
02:39	<break_>	i'm on windows.
02:39	<cables>	Sun JRE is over 100 mb installed? Wow.
02:39	<Kamaria>	I'm thinking I might end up having to format Linux again.
02:39	<break_>	and if i didnt need a tracker, wouldnt it be downloading?
02:39	<NemesisD>	ok guys, for some reason when I use the Metacity window manager, i can play videos fine, but opening ANY video file whilst running Beryl causes the video to open then close abruptly
02:39	<eck>	Kamaria: it is fairly straightforward to reinstall grub after installing windows. Booting from a Cd is separate from grub
02:40	<break_>	ive had the torrent going for almost 20 minutes now
02:40	<xiven>	How well do I have to know C/C++/ect to write some code for the open source?
02:40	<sooti>	try it from different tracker, break. from the right source feisty has a lot of seeders
02:40	<magnetron>	elpargo: or maybe it is a very secure server? tight firewall... =)
02:40	<elpargo>	Kamaria, windows will probably kill your grub, stupid system...
02:40	<latoo>	break_: 100K isn't downloading?
02:40	<cables>	break_, you need to use a client that can work without a tracker. Like Azureus or uTorrent.
02:40	<boricua>	cables:agree huge
02:40	<xiven>	If I can write a chat server...do I know the language well enough?
02:40	<break_>	i'm using utorrent
02:40	<cables>	boricua, agree huge with what?
02:40	<cables>	break_, is DHT enabled?
02:40	<kbrooks>	xiven: no.
02:40	<Kamaria>	So I take it that it would be a good idea to install Windows on my first HD, and put Linux on the other
02:40	<elpargo>	+1 for latoo 100kb is very good speed
02:40	<cables>	break_, you might need to forward a port or something, because i can download fine without a tracker.
02:40	<kbrooks>	xiven, there is aa bigger test
02:40	<eck>	J-_: i'm not sure what it's called off the top of my head, but there's a standard debian tool to test the latency of all the apt mirrors and tell you which one is fastest
02:40	<boricua>	cables:sun java i am installlign it now
02:40	<tripsync>	anyone know how to get ubuntu to recognize my modeline in xorg.conf after I install the nvidia driver, or get opengl support with the nv one?
02:40	<elpargo>	Kamaria, yes indeed
02:40	<xiven>	What is that?
02:40	<J-_>	wth, im getting 404 not found!?
02:41	<cables>	boricua, yeah
02:41	<boricua>	cables:sucks
02:41	<Pelo>	break_,  be patient , it's worth the wait
02:41	<elpargo>	tripsync, install "envy" it will automatically do everything
02:41	<Vanuatoo_>	Ok, people. I've got AMD Athlon 3500+, ATI Radeon X850XT, Asus A8N-E. I had Windows XP Installed on my computer. I've installed Feisty in dual boot mode. When I run ubuntu it has random crashes, lockups and so on. I'm running with the kernel parameters -noapic -acpi=off. Does anyone experience the same?
02:41	<latoo>	tripsync: too little info
02:41	<boricua>	cables:does that put the plugin automaticly or i need to do the softlink
02:41	<elpargo>	Vanuatoo_, why acpi off??
02:41	<Kamaria>	elpargo: Lol, Ubuntu ate my Windows install somehow and I couldn't boot into it. Now that I finally have a second hard drive I'm just going to run them on seperate drives and hope that they don't try to kill each other.
02:41	<kalifornia909>	anyone ever use ubuntu on an a7n8x delux mobo
02:41	<tripsync>	elpargo: ty
02:41	<NemesisD>	beryl seems to be preventing video files from playing, anyone thing they can help me out with this?
02:41	<elpargo>	Kamaria, yes it has a big warning saying it's going to do that
02:42	<Vanuatoo_>	elpargo: because without it I was not able even to install it
02:42	<break_>	DHT is enabled, but it wont work
02:42	<nibsa1242>	Vanuatoo_: only time I've experienced random crashes etc was while attempting to install Feisty
02:42	<elpargo>	Vanuatoo_, that doesn't makes sense
02:42	<Vanuatoo_>	The install program crashed every time
02:42	<Pie-rate>	NemesisD: go to #beryl
02:42	<eck>	Kamaria: you will still need to use grub to dual boot, unless you want to swap the HDDs around

02:42	<magnetron>	Kamaria: you have to choose if it will eat Windows or share place
02:42	<cables>	boricua, install sun-java5/6-plugin, then run sudo update-alternatives --config java and choose the Sun one.
02:42	<J-_>	anyone know of a good area to download packages atm?
02:42	<elpargo>	eck, yea but windows will not kill the MBR on the first drive
02:42	<break_>	when i tried dual booting, windows always checked the other hard drive for errors
02:42	<latoo>	J-_: other than repos? google getdeb
02:42	<Pelo>	!ati >	Vanuatoo_   this might help you out, check the pm window
02:43	<Kamaria>	Eck: Can I make sure Grub installs on the OTHER hard drive so it doesn't eat the Windows bootloader?
02:43	<Angeluz>	Greetings.
02:43	<elpargo>	i'm confused wasn't 1.6 going to be default in 7.04?
02:43	<Kamaria>	And then just use the other hard drive as the boot device?
02:43	<break_>	unhook your windows drive when you install ubuntu
02:43	<cables>	elpargo, 1.6 what?
02:43	<kbrooks>	elpargo, 1.6 what?
02:43	<cables>	:)
02:43	<Jenn>	what is the difference between Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.20-15-386 and Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.20-15-generic?
02:43	<Kevin>	Kamaaria, you can always fix the windows bootloader
02:43	<elpargo>	:p java don't you follow the messages
02:43	<eck>	Kamaria: i'm not sure if it's possible in the graphical installer -- if you can skip the bootloader install step you can run the grub install command manually and make sure it goes to the right place
02:43	<nibsa1242>	just don't use windows its pointless anyway
02:43	<J-_>	latoo: no, I mean an area (part of the world) it seems the default canadian repos are not working?
02:43	<emet>	does grub-install come with ubuntu
02:44	<cables>	elpargo, both are available i believe
02:44	<latoo>	Kamaria: you don't need the windows bootloader. grub can load both
02:44	<mastroDani>	eck, if you written something else i loosed it... i was checking /var/log/messages as you told me.. i checked the last boot... the disk seems to be detected as SCSI, simply.. i'm sure it isn't... the graphic card is recognised as nVidia GeForce 420 Go (right), and than it say that it's supported by the "legacy" drivers.. on ubuntu 6.10 my card just work with NOT legacy driver..!!!
02:44	<darx>	where is the mount point for windows shares?
02:44	<Kevin>	Kamaria you can always fix the windows bootloader
02:44	<Angeluz>	How do I scan my tv-card for channels with TVtime?
02:44	<elpargo>	cables, I remember reading they will default to 1.6
02:44	<Pelo>	Jenn,  generic is a bogus package that checks and install the kernel you need
02:44	<Kamaria>	I'll figure it out.
02:44	<Oni-Dracula>	soooo upgraded to 7.04...and reinstalled my nvidia drivers from apt-get and now X is screwed...says module isn't loaded
02:44	<Kamaria>	Somehow.
02:44	<Kamaria>	:P
02:44	<robbie_crash>	After upgrading to Fiesty, my slave drive on IDE2 will not work, it's not the drive, it's the channel, it's also 99% not likely a hardware issue as it was working immediately prior to booting into fiesty for the first time

02:44	<Kevin>	Kamaria it gives you the option of where you want to install the bootloader on the summary screen if you click advanced
02:45	<Jenn>	Pelo: But to use my ubuntu, I go into generic and not 386 because my screen freezes at ubuntu logo screen. Is this fine?...
02:45	<TFMM>	does anyone know if it's possible to get WPA to work with the Netgear WG111?
02:45	<eck>	mastroDani: I'm not sure about the nvidia stuff, i've never had an nvidia card
02:45	<Jordan_U>	robbie_crash, Can you mount it manually? does it show up in a sudo fdisk -l ?
02:45	<magnetron>	!enter >	Kamaria
02:45	<Kevin>	Kamaria, im sorry, not bootloader....I meant grub
02:45	<Pelo>	Jenn,  yes it is fine
02:45	<elpargo>	Jenn, you should use generic anyway
02:45	<budmang1>	what is the fiesty channel?
02:45	<mastroDani>	eck, tnx.. i will try the legacy driver as it say :/ i'm a bit skeptical
02:45	<elpargo>	Kevin, grub = bootloader
02:45	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/2160/im000949ay5.jpg any ideas?
02:45	<darx>	where does nautilus mount network shares?

02:45	<magnetron>	TFMM, do you use ndiswrapper? then probably no

02:46	<Kamaria>	Okay then, Kevin. I'll have to boot into LiveCD again and hope I can finally fix this. Thanks
02:46	<Pelo>	imbecile,   saying you were having kernel panick on the live cd would have been simplet,   try the alternate install cd
02:46	<codeyman>	hi ppl.. is the upgrade process from edgy to feisty seamless.. or am i up for a rough ride like when i upgraded to fiesty?
02:46	<elpargo>	DarkX, /media

02:46	<moDumass>	hey all, im trying to enable dualview on my geforce fx5950ultra but when i restart x- failes to start so i go with the backed up xorg.conf file, how would i go about starting dualview?
02:46	<Kevin>	elpargo thanks for the information i already knew
02:46	<budmang1>	no sound plays but it sees everything.
02:46	<tripsync>	latoo: I installed Fiesty and added a modeline in xorg.conf to make my resolution 1440x900, but after I installed the nvidia driver, it stopped recognizing this modeline and my resolution went back to 1024x768...my dilemma is I want to retain my resolution while having the nvidia driver so I can use programs such as beryl
02:46	<elpargo>	codeyman, update-manager -d worked like a charm here
02:46	<Jordan_U>	robbie_crash, Does it show up in lspci /

02:46	<imbecile>	pelo, ive installed using this one several times.. also have already tried that with others
02:46	<Jenn>	elpargo and pelo: I have the old Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-386 and Generic. I want to remove them from my grub screen so it will look much cleaner. How would I go on about doing this?

=== help is now known as BeauJeste
02:47	<latoo>	tripsync: the nvidia installer probably wiped your modeline. did you re-add it?
02:47	<Jordan_U>	codeyman, If you are upgrading from Edgy and you don't have a bunch of obscure repositories it should be fine
02:47	<sdfasdfawef>	tripsync: what card do you have?

02:47	<TheIronChef>	any linux based p2p program ot dl music?

02:47	<knix_>	How does NX server work?  Is there server the computer you want to get to or?
02:47	<tripsync>	latoo: it's still there, I checked it again...it's just not loading it for some strange reason
02:47	<robbie_crash>	Jordan_U: the controller does, but not the actual drive
02:47	<elpargo>	codeyman, yes it did
02:47	<TFMM>	magnetron, I'm using the out of the box driver which says my hardware doesn't support wpa
02:47	<ajehuk>	eck - you should know this - do you still get the software raid options when configuring partitions on the newer ubuntu installers?

02:57	<asooo>	Tom, thank you,but when i just type that,it just give me a code name 2.6.17-11-generic,where is the i686?
02:57	<eck>	underwatercow: i suppose it could be done for something like VNC if someone sat down and wrote a PAM policy
02:57	<tom_>	Malachi: are there any error codes or anything
02:57	<Malachi>	The program 'oowriter' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:
02:57	<Malachi>	sudo apt-get install openoffice.org-writer
02:57	<Malachi>	bash: oowriter: command not found
02:57	<magnetron>	underwatercow: gtg
02:57	<tom_>	asooo: hmmm
02:57	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, do you have another OS to see if it detects it? are you sure the cable is good? is it plugin correctly?
02:57	<underwatercow>	magnetron: same, later
02:57	<nibsa1242>	Malachi: have you tried complete removal and then reinstall of open office?
02:57	<Malachi>	But openoffice.org-writer is installed, tom_
02:57	<underwatercow>	thanks eck for your help too
02:58	<ajehuk>	Malachi - odd -
02:58	<Malachi>	jibsa1242: No....I guess I'll try it...
02:58	<tom_>	asooo: when you boot, you need to go into grub and pick the i686 kernel
02:58	<DNA`>	is there a way to burn a cd iso on an empty dvd and install ubuntu 7.04 from it??
02:58	<Malachi>	nibsa1242: What should I uninstall?
02:58	<seph209>	Can someone help me troubleshoot my sound on ubuntu? It used to work, but now it does not work. Any suggestions on where to start troubleshooting?
02:58	<Flannel>	DNA`: yeah.  burning a CD image to a DVD works fine
02:58	<ajehuk>	Malachi - odd - and if you lanuch openoffice.org-writer?
02:58	<elpargo>	Malachi, can you try that with a different user? or do a reinstall of oo
02:58	<nibsa1242>	Malachi, all of it
02:58	<tom_>	seph209: there is a really good guide on the wiki i think
02:58	<vafada>	how do i disable Sound Juicer to automatically run when i insert an Audio CD?
02:58	<tom_>	seph209: it got my sound working when it borked
02:58	<Malachi>	ajehuk: command not found
02:58	<mastroDani>	eck, as i told you before.. the strange thing is this.. i have that applet "system monitor" i don't know the english name.. that one you can add to the panel and it gave you the "real time" graph of the CPU usage, RAM, disk, net.. and LOAD.. i have a big load.. but the processor is not very used i have half of the ram free and no net/disc activity... and the load is say "2.5" wich is more or less "half" the graph he
02:58	<mastroDani>	igh... if i start using apt-get to install something the load go up to 5 or more (max in the graph)
02:58	<tom_>	vafada: go to system >	preferences
02:59	<nibsa1242>	buring a CD image to a DVD should work fine... but I've had issues
02:59	<robbie_crash>	I'm positive it's not hardware, I've switched the hdd's around, plugged in one at a time, with either end of the ide cable, and they always show up. It's just when both are on at the same time that the second one doesn't show up.
02:59	<Malachi>	elpargo: I guess I could create a new user...
02:59	<nibsa1242>	I suggest using a rw material
02:59	<tom_>	vafada: then removable drives and media
02:59	<robbie_crash>	elpargo: that last one was for you
02:59	<Hubris>	Seph - another good guide on the forums, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
02:59	<Malachi>	elpargo: But I'll try a reinstall first.
02:59	<FernLujan>	hey, I Need help
02:59	<Malachi>	nibsa1242: And purge?
02:59	<eck>	mastroDani: load up top and see which processes are in the running state
02:59	<tom_>	vafada: there are preferences for when some cd gets put in your computer
02:59	<tom_>	FernLujan: whats the problem
02:59	<aimes>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2398659#post2398659
02:59	<robbie_crash>	elpargo: I'll post if you want
02:59	<vafada>	tom_ saw it thanks
02:59	<asooo>	tom_:no, it isn't on the list,i just install it in the synaptic,but i can't find it or make sure it work or not...sign
02:59	<robbie_crash>	*repost
02:59	<mastroDani>	eck... yup..
02:59	<ajehuk>	Malachi - I would go for a reinstall of the whole oo suite - looks like something is missing or misconfigured - I assume apt-get install openoffice.org / or using synaptic / aptitude would be the best next move
02:59	<elpargo>	Malachi, why??? for oo
03:00	<elpargo>	DAMMIT this is not windows
03:00	<tom_>	vafada: np
03:00	<elpargo>	you should not reinstall to make it work
03:00	<jojoman02>	hey how can i encrypt a folder with a password?
03:00	<FernLujan>	tom_: I just installed ubuntu 7.04, and everything is fine, except for the fact that I can't enable Desktop EFfects
03:00	<elpargo>	./rant
03:00	<eck>	mastroDani: I had a problem similar to this in edgy where there were a bunch of pdflush processes running and my load was hovering around 10
03:00	<tom_>	asooo: hmm ok how come you want that kernel, just for performance?
03:00	<ajehuk>	elpargo - no but if the component is not isntalled you need to install it
=== Bmms is now known as TomBug
03:00	<tom_>	FernLujan: what 3d card do you have
03:00	<elpargo>	Malachi, can you open a new shell and try there
03:00	<FernLujan>	tom_: ATI Radeon X550X
03:00	<Malachi>	elpargo: ?
03:00	<elpargo>	ajehuk, and he just said it shows as installed
03:00	<tom_>	FernLujan: have you installed the drivers for it
03:00	<seph209>	thanks, I'll start in those places.
03:00	<ataylor>	hi
03:00	<ataylor>	i just upgraded to 7.04 and my internet is very slow
03:00	<tom_>	seph209: np
03:00	<Malachi>	elpargo: Define new shell. Something besides bash?
03:01	<ajehuk>	elpargo - in apt?
03:01	<ataylor>	im on a speedtouch 330 modem
03:01	<Malachi>	elpargo: Or try it under sudo?
03:01	<FernLujan>	tom_: yes, in the restricted drivers manager, and everything was installed properl
03:01	<asooo>	Tom_:because my cpu is p4 so i think the i686 is suit my pc
03:01	<ataylor>	worked perfectly fine under 6.10
03:01	<eck>	mastroDani: the load is basically the average numbre of processes in the running state, so you might be able to find out what is driving the load up by looking for those processes
03:01	<tom_>	ataylor: what do you mean slow
03:01	<Malachi>	elpargo: Or what?
03:01	<mastroDani>	eck, what's pdflush?
03:01	<elpargo>	Malachi, bash just another instance
03:01	<tom_>	FernLujan: so are you sure you have 3d support
03:01	<ataylor>	takes up to 30 seconds for web pages to load
03:01	<elpargo>	 robbie_crash maybe there is a change in dbus that's causing your drive not to be found
03:01	<mjr>	FernLujan, actually, I think you shouldn't install the restricted drivers for that particular card (or none of the ATI cards <x1000)
03:01	<ataylor>	this irc chat is laggy
03:01	<fenris>	hi
03:01	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/2160/im000949ay5.jpg any ideas?
03:01	<verma>	doing a full upgrade on a beta system will upgrade to 7.04 release .. right?
03:01	<eck>	mastroDani: it's a process the kernel spawns to write data out to the hard disk. this was a bug in the 2.6.17 kernel
03:01	<Malachi>	elpargo: openoffice.org-writer still gives me nothing.
03:01	<mjr>	(except maybe mobility 200M)
03:01	<mastroDani>	eck, tnx for the explaination :) i watch now
03:01	<jrib>	!final >	verma    (verma, see the private message from ubotu)
03:01	<eck>	(it's been fixed now, i think)
03:01	<tom_>	asooo: hmm ok, well i'm not really sure mate, mb have a look on google
03:01	<robbie_crash>	elpargo: uninstall and reinstall dbus and all dependencies?
03:02	<FernLujan>	mjr: the desktop effects didn't work before I installed the driver either
03:02	<elpargo>	Malachi,  no no that should be oowriter
03:02	<Malachi>	But elpargo, and ajehuk, I do get (process:20997): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: gtype.c:2242: initialization assertion failed, use IA__g_type_init() prior to this function
03:02	<Malachi>	(process:20997): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_screen_get_font_options: assertion `GDK_IS_SCREEN (screen)' failed
03:02	<Malachi>	
03:02	<FernLujan>	tom_: Can you rephrase that?
03:02	<asooo>	Tom_:thank you
03:02	<mjr>	FernLujan, x500 should be supported by the free driver, you see, and fglrx doesn't work with AIGLX afaik
03:02	<Malachi>	wehn I try ooffice -writer
03:02	<mastroDani>	eck, can't be this problem is related with the libata?
03:02	<tom_>	ataylor: type "ping -c 5 google.com" in a terminal tell me what it says
03:02	<fenris>	hm, i just updated to feisty and activated those "desktop effects"... but now my window frames are gone?
03:02	<verma>	jrib, nice .. thanks
03:02	<tom_>	asooo: np, sorry i couldnt help
03:02	<Malachi>	elpargo: Still nothing
03:02	<tom_>	FernLujan: ok type this in a terminal
03:02	<FernLujan>	mjr: so I just disable the restricted drivers I recently installed?
03:02	<mjr>	FernLujan, might've been something else wrong with your xorg.conf then, but I don't know how effect-friendly Feisty configures it by default
03:02	<elpargo>	Malachi, open up synaptics and reinstall openoffice package (the whole thing)
03:02	<ddwagnz>	hi ho
03:03	<eck>	mastroDani: I suppose it could be
03:03	<bofh80>	fenris, that only happens to the open ones, close open a new app / window
03:03	<nibsa1242>	I have to use the restriced driver with my X800... but I think anything lower then X700 the free driver is as good or better
03:03	<FernLujan>	mjr: do you think it's possible for me to get beryl working on my desktop with this videocard?
03:03	<Malachi>	elpargo: Yeah, I'm about to do that.
03:03	<FernLujan>	tom_: I'm ready
03:03	<tom_>	FernLujan: probably
03:03	<mjr>	FernLujan, anyway, I tried, successfully, the effects on my radeon x850 and free drivers, after tinkering a bit with my (legacy) xorg.conf
03:03	<mastroDani>	eck, how can i move up-down the list on top?
03:03	<mjr>	FernLujan, yes
03:03	<fenris>	bofh80: doesnt help... i even logged out and in again
03:03	<mastroDani>	eck, with "top" i mean the program
03:03	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, how about searching their tracker for a bug report
03:03	<bofh80>	the 3d cube desktop is awesome :D
03:03	<latoo>	FernLujan: if it has 64MB of ram or more should be fine
03:03	<tom_>	FernLujan: sorry just checking the command :)
03:03	<mastroDani>	eck, in that case i have to install a non-ubuntu kernel?
03:04	<FernLujan>	mjr: How could I go about installing beryl?
03:04	<SciOly>	I'm using Edgy but I have not automagic "upgrade" button in upgrade-manager, anyone might know why?
03:04	<mjr>	FernLujan, but of course, it's still experimental and so on, so YMMV, and you might have to do something to advance it
03:04	<russiane39_>	Hi! Anyone can tell me, where Restricted Devices manager situated in Kubuntu 7.0.4 ?
03:04	<fiction>	!lamp
03:04	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
03:04	<Flannel>	SciOly: is your edgy completely up to date?
03:04	<bofh80>	fenris, agh, nasty, turn it off :F - what graphics card you got?
03:04	<elpargo>	SciOly, you need to pass -d to it
03:04	<SciOly>	Flannel, yes
03:04	<Flannel>	elpargo: no you dont
03:04	<SciOly>	elpargo, I tried -d, no success
03:04	<ddwagnz>	tell me..... with 6.06 is it possiable to create a new partition and install on that partition that you created?
03:04	<fenris>	bofh80: nvidia 7800gt
03:04	<Flannel>	SciOly: do you have edgy-updates repositories?
03:04	<snadge>	i've just updated to feisty, how do i enable desktop effects with ati radeon 9550 video/
03:04	<Arrick>	!ubuntu
03:04	<FernLujan>	mjr: I just got linux today, so I don't know how to install things and stuff
03:04	<ubotu>	Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuHowCome
03:04	<mjr>	FernLujan, first you should try to get the basic compiz working, so you have a working configuration. Then worry about beryl
03:04	<tom_>	FernLujan: ok type "glxinfo | grep rendering" in a console, and tell me what it says
03:04	<elpargo>	Flannel, for the dist-upgrade?? yes you do
03:04	<scuzzlebutt>	hello can i get help here with installing something, for fiesty fawn?
03:04	<teem0>	When  using the kboot and the livecd desktop version (PS3 Port) can I type something at the kboot prompt instead of just pressing enter to start the installer instead of loading the live session.
03:05	<Flannel>	elpargo: No.  -d is only for development versions.  Feisty is final.
03:05	<tom_>	FernLujan: don't woryy man, you'll get the hang of it
03:05	<mjr>	FernLujan, then you shouldn't be trying too hard to get up and running with this experimental stuff
03:05	<asooo>	is the ubuntu 7.04 have the 3d wm install on default?
03:05	<bofh80>	fenris, you git. ok....do you use synaptic? search for name nvidia - tell me which one you have installed?
03:05	<tom_>	scuzzlebutt: what you wanna install
03:05	<Malachi>	elpargo, ajehuk: Funny, says it can't be authenticated.
03:05	<SciOly>	Flannel, I have: edgy-updates main restricted
03:05	<russiane39_>	where Restricted Devices manager situated in Kubuntu 7.0.4 ?
03:05	<nibsa1242>	ddwagnz you could do that, but you'd probably need the alternative install cd to set up grub correctly
03:05	<latoo>	FernLujan: yes, "desktop effects" are still unstable
03:05	<LsBlend>	Help Needed!!!
03:05	<scuzzlebutt>	i want to install Hamachi
03:05	<FernLujan>	tom_: DIrect rendering: yes
03:05	<tom_>	LsBlend: whats the matter
03:05	<Flannel>	SciOly: hmm.  What version "update-manager" package do you have/
03:05	<tom_>	FernLujan: ok great, that means your 3d acceleration is on
03:05	<elpargo>	Flannel, ahhh yes sorry that's -c
03:05	<fenris>	bofh80: uhm, it seems that the gnome terminal is all white, and nothing happens if i write into it... grrr
03:05	<LsBlend>	I need to partition my HD
03:05	<LsBlend>	I only have one
03:05	<elpargo>	SciOly, update-manager -c
03:05	<LsBlend>	no partitions
03:05	<bofh80>	hahahah
03:05	<elpargo>	sorry L)
03:06	<scuzzlebutt>	i think i used the wrong site cuz when i tried to cennoct it it didn't work
03:06	<tom_>	scuzzlebutt: whats hamachi
03:06	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/2160/im000949ay5.jpg any ideas?
03:06	<Flannel>	elpargo: no.  SciOly, -c is only if you're on dapper. (Only to move away from LTS)
03:06	<FernLujan>	mjr: I know a bit how to use linux, but I'm not an advanced user
03:06	<Vanuatoo_>	When I start firefox it closes automatically in 5 seconds
03:06	<FernLujan>	mjr: I'm sure if someone helped me along the way I could install compiz
03:06	<LsBlend>	i have to keep windows installed
03:06	<jason10>	whats goin on everybody
03:06	<LsBlend>	for a dual boot
03:06	<bofh80>	fenris, System >	Administration >	Synaptic ..... you can use the menu still right?
03:06	<SciOly>	Flannel, 0.45.2
03:06	<mjr>	FernLujan, compiz is installed, it's the "desktop effects" thingy you can't get working :] 
03:06	<scuzzlebutt>	its a program where you can allow some1 to have control over ur pc to help you fix things
03:06	<LsBlend>	any help?
03:06	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on 7.04 for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?
03:06	<tom_>	FernLujan: when you open up the ddesktop effects thing what does it say
03:06	<elpargo>	Flannel, yes he asked for upgrade...
03:06	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - probably - how far have you gotten (oh and what is your card?)
03:06	<nny>	evening all.. so what about edgy made udev load my hard drive as hda, but after an upgrade it is now sda.? I have fixed, but i was unclear as to why the new kernel has labeled it differently
03:06	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/2160/im000949ay5.jpg any ideas?
03:06	<nibsa1242>	Does anyone have any tips for installing a fesh Fiesty install over a Failed fiesty upgrade?
03:07	<FernLujan>	the composite extension is not available
03:07	<bofh80>	ohh, is there a HOTKEY for Desktop Effects? On / Off hotkey? anyone?
03:07	<tom_>	LsBlend: as you can see its really busy in here, if you type everything in one post, its easier to read
03:07	<nny>	nibsa1242, what failed?
03:07	<elpargo>	Flannel, it will hop you to 6.10 and then 7.04 is there another way??
03:07	<mjr>	FernLujan, anyway, I do believe you should uninstall the proprietary driver first since I don't think it supports AIGLX, whereas the free driver should for your card, and if you have trouble with that, it should be configurable to work, unlike fglrx
03:07	<LsBlend>	nowisn
03:07	<Flannel>	elpargo: You don't need ANY flags to go from 6.10 to 7.04
03:07	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: ATI Radeon X550X, I haven't done anything except install the restricted ATI drivers yet.
03:07	<LsBlend>	i cant talk to you
03:07	<tom_>	imbecile: haha did you take that wit a digital camera ?
03:08	<fenris>	bofh80: nvidia-glx version is 1.0.9631
03:08	<LsBlend>	it wont let me
03:08	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - noooooooooooooo
03:08	<Flannel>	elpargo: -c is only for 6.06 to 6.10, -d is only if you wanted to upgrade while Feisty was still in beta
03:08	<SciOly>	Flannel, sorry... xchat just segfaulted
03:08	<jason10>	if anybody wouldnt mind, i have a question about mounting a hard drive in ubuntu?
03:08	<imbecile>	tom_ yuppers.. i couldnt get that box to boot
03:08	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: I'm disabling it though
03:08	<bofh80>	fenris, i do believe you want the one labeled nvidia-glx-new ?
03:08	<elpargo>	Flannel, well my friend you do at least that's the only way I got it to show up
03:08	<imbecile>	<------ creative
03:08	<nibsa1242>	nny, it hard locked about 65% in... after wating for 20+min and rebooting I get in a CLI with (initramfs) on the left and above that there is a message saying that my root partition can't be found
03:08	<nowisn>	lsblend i'm installing now so if you need a hand then pm me
03:08	<tom_>	imbecile: you have a load of shit drawn on your monitor hey
03:08	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - not an ATI card... I spent about 3 days playig with my 9550 and xorg - the end result was... pitiful
03:08	<fenris>	bofh80: do i?
03:08	<cpar2>	good evening all, I suppose we are talking Feisty tonight :)
03:08	<LsBlend>	i cant!!
03:08	<elpargo>	Flannel, even update-manager help says it
03:08	<bofh80>	fenris, oh yes with that card, oh yes.
=== Rug_ is now known as Rug
03:08	<Flannel>	SciOly: hmm.  Well, 0.45.2 is the required version.  Try reloading the package list... er, check for updates, or whatnot
03:08	<tom_>	imbecile: the kernel is panicing for some reason, that means some hardware isnt workng properly
03:08	<Flannel>	elpargo: no.  it doens't.
03:08	<ajehuk>	cpar2 - whats a feisty? :)
03:08	<FernLujan>	mjr: after I disable the ATI drivers, what can I do to enable desktop effects?
03:09	<mjr>	ajehuk, well I played 3 minutes with x800 and compiz worked.
03:09	<teem0>	When  using the kboot and the livecd desktop version (PS3 Port) can I type something at the kboot prompt instead of just pressing enter to start the installer instead of loading the live session.
03:09	<elpargo>	Flannel, fine in my machine it didn't unless I added -c
03:09	<bofh80>	fenris, you can use that to install it, it will remove the other one, no other changes should be needed . . . . . . just to restart X or the PC
03:09	<Vanuatoo_>	Why firefox closes after 5 seconds? Where can I see more details?
03:09	<tom_>	FernLujan: why would you disable the ati drivers
03:09	<imbecile>	tom_ I used to be a graffiti writer.. hehe is there anyway to troubleshoot what hardware is buggered?
03:09	<elpargo>	Vanuatoo_, run it from a shell
03:09	<ajehuk>	mjr - gonna need a new card - - oh and well volunteered to help FernLujan out with his install :)
03:09	<tom_>	Vanuatoo_: open firefox from the console
03:09	<nny>	nibsa1242, you can always to just run the cd again and tell it to install. It will ask you if you want to reformat or even repartition the hard drive during the install process
03:09	<scuzzlebutt>	i give up, l8trz
03:10	<tom_>	imbecile: ummm does it mention anywhere a piece of hardware?
03:10	<mjr>	tom_, because the fglrx drivers should really _only_ be used if the free drivers don't support your card
03:10	<SciOly>	Flannel, yeah... I've been checking, not sure if there is some crucial step I'm missing... every package is up to date on the machine
03:10	<fenris>	bofh80: does the -new version work with the old kernel module?
03:10	<FernLujan>	tom_: that's what someone told me to do to get desktop effects working?
03:10	<tom_>	FernLujan: no dont do that
03:10	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: I'm extremely confused
03:10	<bofh80>	fenris, err, why what are you doing? heheh.
03:10	<FernLujan>	tom_: okay
03:10	<nny>	so anyone know the name of the new and improved network manager? I lost the use of connection-manager and henceforth, my wireless after upgarde
03:10	<nibsa1242>	nny: I don't have a cd yet... I'm dowloading right now. I was trying to recommended upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 but that trashed my system
03:10	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - how so?
03:10	<Vanuatoo_>	Xchat also crashed
03:10	<nny>	nibsa1242, heh mine too
03:10	<imbecile>	tom_ not specifically.. at least i dont think so
03:10	<PurpZeY>	I am seriously consider an Ubuntu install, can someone answer a couple of quick ?s?
03:10	<bofh80>	fenris, your not booting with the latest availble kernel?
03:10	<mjr>	ajehuk, because tom is feeding him misinformation
03:10	<Flannel>	SciOly: that's very odd.  Uh, I dont know.  Alright, to humor him, go ahead and alt-f2 then in that paste `gksu "update-manager -c"`
03:10	<Vanuatoo_>	It says Segmentation fault. Core dumped
03:10	<ajehuk>	PurpZeY - go
03:10	<cpar2>	anyone out there using a Dell Latitude D600?
03:10	<fenris>	bofh80: sure i am
03:10	<nny>	nibsa1242, wait... what part does it stop at again?
03:10	<Ax4>	gogoogoggo
03:10	<jrib>	PurpZeY: just ask, if someone knows, they will try
03:10	<Ax4>	gogogo
03:10	<Vanuatoo_>	Next steps please? :)
03:10	<Ax4>	lol
03:11	<ajehuk>	mjr well that doesnt help...
03:11	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: had lots of people talking to me, now my head's everywhere and not only did I forget what I was having troubles with. I forgot everyone's advice!
03:11	<tom_>	mjr: why would he disable his 3d drivers to get compiz to work
03:11	<nny>	nibsa1242, heh i bet we both have the same issue, but i fixed min'
03:11	<Ax4>	we're all on the edge of our seats
03:11	<nibsa1242>	nny it stopped when it said there were 17min left
03:11	<Ax4>	:p
03:11	<bofh80>	fenris, lol, why you askin about the old kernel module then? :P
03:11	<nibsa1242>	nny and my computer was completely locked up
03:11	<elpargo>	nny, it should be loaded if not the util is call  network-admin
03:11	<seph209>	tom_ any ideas on what to google for to get to the audio fix sound guide? I don't know what wiki you are talking about...
03:11	<mjr>	tom_, he shouldn't. He should use the free ones that actually do support texture_from_pixmap
03:11	<nowisn>	oh crap what the hell, i got that error agian, says GRUB loading please wait..... error 17???
03:11	<PurpZeY>	Well, I've played with the live CD...and I think I am ready to "convert" but I was hoping to do a dual boot, any reason that's a bad idea?
03:11	<tom_>	imbecile: you could try passing the kernel some options
03:11	<nibsa1242>	nny I couldn't even ctrl-atl-backspace
03:11	<tom_>	seph209: i'll have a look
03:11	<nny>	nibsa1242, well, after an upgrade my hardd rive switch from hda to sda
03:11	<nny>	nibsa1242, try this first
03:11	<tom_>	mjr: ah k roger, my mistake (don't know much about ati drivers) :)
03:11	<fenris>	bofh80: "old" in the sense of "the one working with the old nvidia-glx"
03:11	<ajehuk>	mjr - you dealing with it tho? Ive been through the most of the variations if anyone gets stuck.  but then none of the drivers really are right for my card so - ah anyway who cares, I boutha third monitor so Im happy
03:11	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, no it's not a bad idea, plenty of people do it
03:11	<nny>	nibsa1242, when it load, what kernel is it trying to boot?
03:11	<tom_>	FernLujan: listen to mjr
03:12	<SciOly>	Flannel, just... "Your system is up-to-date" is all I see (and it reloads all the package info fine)
03:12	<nny>	nibsa1242,  2.6.20-15
03:12	<nny>	?
03:12	<PurpZeY>	Ax4: Can I create a partition on my main drive or do I need a second dedicated drive?
03:12	<FernLujan>	tom_: k, ty
03:12	<nibsa1242>	nny no it tried 2.6.11
03:12	<shadow->	anyone hear of an issue where you get a black screen with a cursor, but no way to get out?
03:12	<tom_>	seph209: ok found it
03:12	<FernLujan>	mjr: so, can you help me get my desktop effects working?
03:12	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, either or, you can setup a new partition on your current drive, or use a second physical drive
03:12	<bofh80>	fenris, oh i see yes, the nvidia-glx module is really up to gf3 and gf4 cards, everything above that is nvidia-glx-new i believe
03:12	<nny>	nibsa1242, you should be able to boot the old kernel or a new one
03:12	<teem0>	When  using the kboot and the livecd desktop version (PS3 Port) can I type something at the kboot prompt instead of just pressing enter to start the installer instead of loading the live session.
03:12	<mtm8>	Would anyone be able to help me figure out the d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe_file string /hd-media/recipe line that comes standard with the alternate CD installer for remastering purposes?
03:12	<mtm8>	1) Where is /hd-media 2) How can I make a partition scheme as follows?: /dev/sda1: 128 M for /boot (ext2) with no disk space allocated for the super user with noauto,noatime options for mounting, /dev/sda2: 40 G for / with 3 percent disk space allocated for the super user and defaults,errors=remount-ro options for mounting, /dev/sda3: 11 G extended partition, /dev/sda4: an NTFS partition that isn't mounted, /dev/sda5: 1 G swap, /dev/sda6: 10 G (ext3) partition with
03:12	<william>	How do I connect to a PAN using bluetooth?
03:12	<bofh80>	fenris, they are both esigned to work with the same kernel modules etc
03:12	<tom_>	seph209: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
03:12	<nny>	nibsa1242, even if it was 50% into an upgrade, it doesnt switch packages out till the end
03:13	<nibsa1242>	nny I also tried 2.6.10 -didn't even get to a command line; and 2.6.11-recovery got me to the (initramfs) line
03:13	<mjr>	FernLujan, first uninstall the proprietary driver, then wait a bit, I'll put up the basic things to check for in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:13	<tom_>	ok guys i'm rebooting my upgrade just finished
03:13	<PurpZeY>	Ax4: Understandbly there is SOME risk involved in creating the partition and all...Is there a serious risk of losing the data on the older partition in order to do that?
03:13	<Flannel>	SciOly: right.  Well, I don't know what it might be.  From what I understand, the repositories are all dying right now anyway.  So waiting might not be a bad thing.  It ought to work itself out.  But I don't know why it isn't working.
03:13	<seph209>	aw shoot, thats the same one that Hubris suggested.
03:13	<fenris>	bofh80: ok... so i just have to wait for the german mirror... seems to be *a bit* overloaded
03:13	<nibsa1242>	nny 2.6.10 and 2.6.11 are the only options in grub
03:13	<cohete>	Is there are way to upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 using the CD for packages, without having to do a full reinstallation?
03:13	<nny>	nibsa1242, is 2.6.20 in your grub list?
03:13	<nibsa1242>	nny negative
03:13	<seph209>	tom_: Ok, I'll really read this through carefully, but I might have more questions. Thanks!
03:13	<FernLujan>	ok
03:13	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, there is no risk if the drive is health and the re-partition is done correctly
03:14	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, healthy*
03:14	<bofh80>	fenris, LOL i'm not surprised. they haven't released any updates yet, cos they can't deal with the weight heheheh
03:14	<cpar2>	Dell Latitude D600 gets a white bar on the right 1/4 of the screen, and no toolbars after enabling the new graphics hotness - how do I undo it now?
03:14	<SciOly>	Flannel, hm...cause I tried last night too and I just figured it wasn't working because they were being hammered, but now I'm not sure... do you need anything special in the sources.list besides edgy-updates?
03:14	<tbuss>	I've got an apache password issue. I setup a username:/password for my site, atho works but the username:/password that works for autho is no the same as what is in /home/secure/apasswords
03:14	<nny>	nibsa1242, hrrm. have you tried booting it with quit mode and splash turned off to see exactly where it stops?
03:14	<rbil>	cohete: if you insert the alternate CD in your drive when running Edgy, you will be given the option to upgrade from that CD
03:14	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, wouldn't hurt to backup your data though if you can, just in case their's user error on your part :p
03:14	<FernLujan>	mjr: Unistalled drivers
03:14	<nny>	nibsa1242, you can do this by editing grub (hit e at boot) and remove those two worde from the kernel line
03:14	<cohete>	rbil, i have the desktop cd
03:14	<nibsa1242>	nny I have 2.6.17-11-generic and 2.6.17-10-generic

03:15	<tbuss>	ajehuk: hey whats up, still at it
03:15	<mjr>	FernLujan, yes, that's probably best to make sure there's no remains in your memory of the fglrx driver
03:15	<rbil>	cohete: get it with bittorrent, should take less than 1.5 hours
03:15	<FernLujan>	mjr: well, I'll be right back then

=== beto is now known as conserto_quasetu
03:16	<nibsa1242>	nny it didn't boot, it acted as if I soft reset

03:17	<nibsa1242>	nny ok... now its attempting to boot
03:17	<nny>	nibsa1242, cool
03:17	<SciOly>	Flannel, can I check to see what specific package should be downloaded from the repositories to signal an dist-upgrade is being received?
03:17	<nibsa1242>	nny it appears to be having problems at Mounting root file system
03:17	<william>	!bluetooth
03:17	<ubotu>	For instructions on how to set up bluetooth, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
03:17	<FernLujan>	mjr: back
03:17	<nibsa1242>	nny it says "Being: Waiting for root file system... ..." and its hanging there
03:18	<nny>	elpargo, isn't there supposed to be a new wireless network manager? I am looking for something to replace connection-manager
03:18	<Flannel>	SciOly: er, what?
03:18	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/installation-guide/i386/preparing.html
03:18	<thrice`>	is the torrent active for anyone ?
03:18	<nny>	nibsa1242, ok
03:18	<elpargo>	SciOly, Flannel I remember there is a command that tell you the active version of ubuntu can't recall it's name
03:18	<bofh80>	ok, i'm getting worried now, that's 2 people i've attemped to help, with quite simple problems, and they don't return, i'm not so sure i'm giving out sound advice now :S
03:18	<mjr>	FernLujan, ok, just a moment
03:18	<SciOly>	Flannel, well, update-manager must be signalled by some package that it can do a full dist-upgrade?
03:18	<elpargo>	nny, yes its call "network manager"
03:18	<mjr>	FernLujan, do run "glxinfo | grep -i direct" though
03:18	<SciOly>	elpargo, I think cat /etc/issue will tell you what you're running, but that's not what I meant
03:19	<nny>	elpargo, thank you
03:19	<nibsa1242>	nny still hanging at waiting for root file system
03:19	<Ax4>	bofh80, don't get discouraged ^_^ the community thanks you for your input
03:19	<elpargo>	nny, the command to run it is network-admin
03:19	<nny>	nibsa1242, yeah it will stay there
03:19	<ajehuk>	bofh80 - if they didnt come back - assume whatever you said worked.  that makes you a good person.. :)
03:19	<Flannel>	SciOly: Hmm.  Im not actually sure how that works.
03:19	<nny>	nibsa1242, i noticed that after i upgraded, i couldn't load a prior kernel
03:19	<bofh80>	hhehehheh :/
03:19	<Ax4>	bofh80, agree with ajehuk
03:19	<Ax4>	:p
03:19	<FernLujan>	mjr: so "glxinfo | grep -i direct" through console?
03:19	<elpargo>	SciOly, Flannel no there is a direct one Flannel may remember that way you will know if it already upgraded or not
03:19	<nny>	nibsa1242, my 2.6.10 doesnt work
03:19	<robbie_crash>	elpargo, no luck on the bug tracker, and reinstalling dbus didn't help

03:20	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on feisty for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?

03:20	<mjr>	FernLujan, just to check that you have acceleration with the free driver working
03:20	<tbuss>	ajehuk: okay, well I made the changes in the config file Directory <Directory /var/www/>
03:20	<FernLujan>	mjr: yeah, I did that. uhh, Failed request: BadALlox
03:20	<imbecile>	what is a crc error?
03:20	<nibsa1242>	nny well consdiering that I don't have anything other then 2.6.10 and 2.6.11 if I can't load a prior kernel I guess I'm kinda screwed then
03:20	<ajehuk>	tbuss - OK so far..
03:20	<Rictoo>	:S
03:20	<nny>	nibsa1242,  i am still ponder why
03:20	<bofh80>	i'll just pretend he's playing with his new 3d desktop instead
03:20	<Rictoo>	I just loaded up Feisty and everything seems (literally) 75% faster
03:20	<nny>	nibsa1242, yeah a live cd even if you dont do any install would help
03:20	<Rictoo>	is this normal?
03:20	<elpargo>	SciOly, python -v if it's 2.5 then you are already at 7.04
03:20	<FernLujan>	mjr: just like 5-6 lines of error, not sur eif I should paste them, don't want to spam
03:20	<cpar2>	can someone tell me the command to get the new graphics options to open up in Feisty?
03:20	<ajehuk>	tbuss - is this .htacces we are talking about or something more exotic?
03:20	<cpar2>	I have no toolbar...
03:20	<nny>	nibsa1242, you could mount your root partition and "Chroot" into it
03:20	<cpar2>	:)
03:21	<spaznick>	anyone know how i could get my mouse and keybord to work correctly with ubuntu 6.10 on panasonic labtop?

03:21	<ajehuk>	spaznick - what is going wrong?
03:21	<Whiz2>	Help! Someone advised yesterday that i should install exim for my mail server, but they didn't tell me how to access the server to send or receive mail (i login to the TTY service, and it tells me i have mail) I'm totally new at this
03:21	<SciOly>	nope
03:21	<nny>	nibsa1242, at that point you could do an apt-get upgrade and see what crappens
03:21	<m0se5>	spaznick: look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:21	<nny>	nibsa1242, well.. is it a real PIA to have to reinstall?
03:21	<SciOly>	elpargo, nope... lots of libs then 2.4.4c1
03:21	<ajehuk>	tbuss - hmmm OK letme just check that
03:21	<nibsa1242>	nny, now it says "ALERT! /dev/sda5 does not exist. Dropping to a shell!" and then "BusyBox v1.1.3 (Debian 1:1.1.3-2ubuntu3) Built-in shell (ash) and some other stuff

03:22	<elpargo>	SciOly, umm then your probably half way thru
03:22	<bofh80>	Whiz2, that's quite amusing :) musta been a real debian enthusiast :D
03:22	<nibsa1242>	nny its not too much of a PITA, just annoying to have to wait for the CD download
03:22	<nny>	nibsa1242, what does it say above that, for the other devices
03:22	<andytayloruk>	hi
03:22	<Ax4>	rolando, what kinda mouse is it?
03:22	<nny>	nibsa1242, it should say cd rom = /dev/foo etc
03:22	<quinn>	I was just trying to do an edgy->feisty upgrade, and i had some network trouble when it was apt-get updating, and now update-manager doesn't show the Feisty upgrade option anymore. Has anyone else heardof this happening?
03:22	<andytayloruk>	i just upgraded to ubuntu 7.04, and my internet connection is incredibly slow. I'm running a speedtouch 330 modem
03:22	<spaznick>	mousepad on my labtop?
03:22	<nibsa1242>	nny it doesn't say anything thing about cd rom = anything
03:22	<bofh80>	Whiz2, is the exim server on your network, on your own machine?
03:22	<elpargo>	SciOly, could you check /etc/apt/source.lst does it shows 7.04 repos?
03:22	<Whiz2>	bofh80: they were in #php and I was asking them about mail servers. I'm running a dapper release of kubuntu.
03:22	<fenris>	bofh80: ok, now i am running on the -new version... but frames and gnome-terminal-content are still missing

03:23	<ajehuk>	tbuss  OK I'm with you.
03:23	<Ax4>	andytayloruk, connectivity to ubuntu repos or just in general
03:23	<andytayloruk>	in general
03:23	<bofh80>	fenris, hmm, did you restart X or the PC ?
03:23	<cables>	fenris, are you running beryl?
03:23	<andytayloruk>	browsing is incredibly slow
03:23	<andytayloruk>	just hung for minutes last time
03:23	<tbuss>	ajehuk: ok....
03:23	<SciOly>	elpargo, no edgy repositories
03:23	<andytayloruk>	irc timed out
03:23	<cables>	fenris, sometimes the driver update doesn't fix it, but there's a beryl option that will.
03:23	<Ax4>	rolando, there's been reported kernel module problems for ps/2 mice under feisty 7.0.4

03:23	<Flannel>	SciOly: There doesn't seem to be any mention of Feisty not being offered as a bug report.
03:24	<SciOly>	elpargo, err... no 7.04, but edgy respositories
03:24	<neilthereildeil>	i need help with ubuntu
03:24	<rolando>	Ax4 ... ooooohhhh
03:24	<fenris>	bofh80: i had to restart the system, just restarting x didnt work. he complained about wrong module version
03:24	<elpargo>	SciOly, ahh so something is wrong there. update-manager -c did anything?
03:24	<neilthereildeil>	how can i enable root?
03:24	<mjr>	FernLujan, did you notice my message that you should send me the errors?
03:24	<cables>	!root | neilthereildeil
03:24	<ubotu>	neilthereildeil: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
03:24	<Flannel>	neilthereildeil: You don't need to
03:24	<elpargo>	SciOly, but the edgy ones are commented?
03:24	<SciOly>	elpargo, update-manager -c checked everything but gave no button
03:24	<neilthereildeil>	i need it
03:24	<rolando>	Ax4 ... thaaaaanksssss !!!!
03:24	<Ax4>	rolando, it's unconfirmed at this time, but if you can contribute to the bug report, the community thanks you :-)
03:24	<neilthereildeil>	i hate typing sudo all the time
03:24	<bofh80>	fenris, oh :) well ok. err i'm not sure :) but at least your using the correct driver now :)
03:24	<cables>	neilthereildeil, you don't have to
03:24	<SciOly>	elpargo, no... the edgy ones are present, it doesn't say in the directions to comment the edgy ones and add feisty ones...
03:24	<fenris>	cables: i just activated those "desktop effects" in the preferences menu, i suppose it is compiz
03:24	<neilthereildeil>	i do
03:24	<cables>	neilthereildeil, just run sudo -i and you'll get a root terminal
03:24	<neilthereildeil>	for network stuff etc
03:24	<nibsa1242>	nny it says something about my keyboard, the cpuindex, thermal zone and the ACPI fan
03:24	<Flannel>	neilthereildeil: If you're doing a bunch of stuff, use `sudo -i` to open a terminal
03:24	<cables>	neilthereildeil, look what i typed above
03:24	<tbuss>	ajehuk: the entry in /home/secure/apasswords is family:/mQstQkadCZ.o not what I declared earlier, however, I'm only able to access site with family:/encryptedpassword
03:24	<SciOly>	Flannel, yeah... I didn't it mentioned either or on ubuntuforums.com
03:24	<thrice`>	is the torrent for feisty working for anyone ?
03:24	<FernLujan>	mjr: k, sent you the errors
03:24	<cpar2>	can someone offer me some simple help in Feisty - what is the command to get to the new "Desktop Effects"?
03:24	<FernLujan>	mjr: JUST Noticed, sorry
03:25	<PurpZeY>	Persuant to the recent Digg article, is it difficult to access NTFS/Windows partitions from Ubuntu?
03:25	<cables>	fenris, it's easily fixable with beryl.
03:25	<cables>	PurpZeY, read the article, it's easy.
03:25	<elpargo>	SciOly, no update-manager should take care of that for you, I'll suggest you comment out the edgy ones and try again.
03:25	<rolando>	Ax4 ... ok thanks
03:25	<cpar2>	fenris - it is compiz, however they are going to be merging with beryl shortly
03:25	<moDumass>	hmm, i installed some nvidia packages and it seems that my nvidia drivers were uninstalled how would i go about reinstalling them?
03:25	<cpar2>	go Novell
03:25	<Ax4>	rolando, look around the ubuntu forums as well
03:25	<mjr>	FernLujan, others interested, anyway, my checklist for working Desktop Effects with the free radeon driver, hope it helps: http://mjr.iki.fi/tmp/xorg-checklist
03:25	<moDumass>	dont really know how i did this
03:25	<spaznick>	i cant even get the pointer back to the application section again to open terminal
03:25	<Ax4>	rolando, might find some workarounds from other users
03:25	<Flannel>	elpargo: SciOly: commenting edgy repositories won't help.
03:25	<andytayloruk>	any idea ax4?
03:25	<robbie_crash>	PurpZeY, no, it's only write support that's iffy
03:25	<bofh80>	Whiz2, i was not aware exim had a PHP interface, are you using SquirelMail or something similar?
03:25	<mjr>	FernLujan, you didn't
03:25	<fenris>	if switching from compiz to beryl is straightforward i would be happy with beryl
03:25	<mtm8>	Does anyone know how to setup a preseed file for a remastered alternate CD so that it partitions in the following manner?
03:25	<cables>	fenris, it's very straightforward
03:25	<Ax4>	andytayloruk, sorry im helping too many people at once heh
03:25	<mtm8>	/dev/sda1: 128 M (ext2) mounted as /boot with 0% reserved for superuser and noauto,noatime mount options; /dev/sda2: 40 G (ext3) mounted as / with 3% reserved for superuser and defaults,errors=remount-ro mount options; /dev/sda3: 11 G extended partition; /dev/sda4: NTFS partition, not mounted; /dev/sda5: 1 G for swap; /dev/sda6: 10 G (ext3) mounted as /home/DOMAIN with 0% reserved for superuser and defaults,grpquota mount options
03:25	<rolando>	Ax4 .... i am searching .....
03:25	<tbuss>	ajehuk: I would like to find out how I can locate the file that is storing family:/encryptedpassword as I have no idea if it is protected or not
03:25	<andytayloruk>	ok :)
03:25	<fenris>	cables: is there some howto somewhere?
03:26	<cables>	fenris, there's no need
03:26	<nibsa1242>	nny I could use an Edgy live cd... but I won't have a fiesty one for probably 6+ hours since I'm stuck dling both the live cd and the alternate install since my machine is a victim of bug 89853
03:26	<Flannel>	SciOly: suggest you file a bug report against update-manager, in launchpad.  Mention you do have 0.45.2 and edgy and edgy-updates.  They'll know how to workaround and/or fix it and stuff
03:26	<elpargo>	Flannel, aren't they stoping the 7.04 from loading?
03:26	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on feisty for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?
03:26	<fenris>	hm, just "apt-get install beryl" or what? :)
03:26	<cables>	fenris, just open a terminal and run "sudo aptitude install beryl-ubuntu"
03:26	<Flannel>	elpargo: no.
03:26	<fenris>	ok
03:26	<FernLujan>	mjr: did you close the window?
03:26	<hector>	i have a problem with compiz, when i switch to it it doesn't show the windows title
03:26	<nibsa1242>	wow all of a sudden I'm lagging
03:26	<cpar2>	Can someone offer me some simple help in Feisty - what is the command to get to the new "Desktop Effects"?
03:26	<elpargo>	Flannel, they should clover somehow...
03:26	<g35>	hello anyone here have a mobile intel 945g chipset?
03:26	<mjr>	FernLujan, no
03:26	<SciOly>	Flannel, elpargo, I found an old sources.list.distUpgrade file from when I did Dapper to Edgy, I'm renaming that guy and then running update-manager again
03:26	<FernLujan>	mjr: I pasted the things
03:26	<nny>	nibsa1242, need to log brb
03:26	<FernLujan>	should I paste again?
03:26	<cables>	fenris, actually hold on
03:26	<mjr>	FernLujan, yes
03:26	<nowisn>	help please grub bootdisk says error 18 selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by bios???
03:26	<elpargo>	SciOly, no
03:26	<cables>	fenris, type sudo aptitude install beryl-ubuntu emerald
03:27	<Flannel>	SciOly: I'd still file a bug, since you're not the only one who this has happened to
03:27	<bofh80>	hector, what video card do you have? :)
03:27	<shoot^>	guys, just fired up gnome phone manager. i have my phone connected to my comp via. usb. how do i find which port my phone is connected to?
03:27	<SciOly>	Flannel, okay, thanks, I'm trying now
03:27	<fenris>	cables: that was close... i was just hitting enter ;)
03:27	<SciOly>	elpargo, eh?
03:27	<moDumass>	is ok, i googled it
03:27	<Whiz2>	bofh80: the PHP mail is not part of exim. it's part of a forum I have on my server that has PHP pages. The forum includes a PHP mail interface.
03:27	<hector>	bofh80, nvidia
03:27	<cables>	fenris, it wouldn't matter, it would just take a little more time :)
03:27	<nrl>	ye
03:27	<bofh80>	hector, model?
03:27	<Kakurady>	I installed some packages from feisty-proposed. How can I undo it?
03:27	<elpargo>	SciOly, that file has the places to get packages from if you use a very old one you will be telling your system to go back to that state.
03:28	<nibsa1242>	nny thats fine I'm experiencing lag >10s right now ayway
03:28	<Ax4>	andytayloruk, sudo ethtool <network device>	&& ifconfig -a
03:28	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on feisty for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?
03:28	<Flannel>	Kakurady: just remove them with your package manager
03:28	<bofh80>	Whiz2, ah cool, so the interface has an admin side that wants maybe a pop3 address ?
03:28	<tbuss>	ajehuk: excellent point,
03:28	<FernLujan>	mjr: sent again
03:28	<andytayloruk>	Ax4: I'm not in linux at the moment. What does that command do?
03:28	<g35>	how can i download the updated video drivers for my intel 945gm chipset?
03:28	<SciOly>	elpargo, I just meant that I renamed it to some backup to see if it helped, but it actually didn't
03:28	<hector>	bofh80, GeForce Go 6150
03:28	<elpargo>	SciOly, Flannel is right it seems to be a more general thing
03:28	<Kakurady>	Flannel: But I need to know what are they first...
03:28	<cpar2>	What is the command to get to the new "Desktop Effects"?  They hosed my graphics and now I have no toolbar - Anyone
03:28	<Ax4>	andytayloruk, ethtool displays network card settings for the specified device, ifconfig reports errors and collisions associated with data transfer
03:28	<fenris>	cables: ok... and now? just restart x?
03:29	<spaznick>	hey i actually made it to the terminal is there anything i can do to fix this mouse problem? o and the keyboard?
03:29	<cables>	fenris, no need
03:29	<elpargo>	cpar2, it's under system preferences
03:29	<mjr>	FernLujan, oh right, messaging is disabled for non-registered users
03:29	<andytayloruk>	hm ok
03:29	<hector>	bofh80, I alreary configured the drivers for the graphic card
03:29	<cables>	fenris, hit alt-f2 and type beryl-manager
03:29	<elpargo>	cpar2, but it's not the full package :)
03:29	<Rictoo>	where is xorg.conf again? :S
03:29	<Ax4>	andytayloruk, ifconfig is also used for configuration
03:29	<cables>	Rictoo, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:29	<Flannel>	Kakurady: Ah.  Uh, hmm.  I agree.  Are they... newer vrsions? or different packages? or what?
03:29	<ajehuk>	tbuss - in either case there should be a .htaccess file (note its hidden hence the . ) that should point at what password file it is using... i.e. AuthUserFile /usr/local/somewhere/safe/.htpasswd
03:29	<Ax4>	Rictoo, /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:29	<Rictoo>	thanks <3
03:29	<cpar2>	elpargo - I have no Toolbar, so no System|Preferences
03:29	<Rictoo>	thanks <3
03:29	<elpargo>	Rictoo, find / -name xorg.conf
03:29	<Ax4>	lol
03:29	<cpar2>	can you find the actual tool name
03:29	<cables>	cpar2, I'll help you, hold on a sec
03:29	<Generation>	Hey guys how it going , I got a question, how do I reinstall ubuntu and not lose what I have in it,
03:29	<Ax4>	or 'whereis xorg.conf'
03:29	<Whiz2>	bofh80: it has the option to send mail using PHP, or SMTP. I'm currently set to use an external SMTP, but wanted to have it use the server as it's sender instead of my ISP. The interface doesn't have the capability to get mail from the server.. only to send using it.
03:29	<elpargo>	cpar2, run nautilus
03:29	<cables>	cpar2, doing that now
03:29	<fenris>	cables: ok, windows are wobbling.... but still without frames :/
03:30	<Generation>	I did something and cannot get things back the way it was
03:30	<hector>	bofh80, i tried beryl also but it doesn't show the windows title section either
03:30	<Flannel>	Generation: What do you mean?  Dont want to lose anything?  what do you mean by reinstall?
03:30	<Ax4>	actually that'll report /usr/lib so don't use whereis :p
03:30	<Kakurady>	Flannel: newer versions proposed to be updated later...
03:30	<cables>	fenris, do you see a crystal-like icon in your notification area?
03:30	<ajehuk>	tbuss - to test if that is the asswd file in use - you could try just deleting the users line (or better copying it somewhere) saving it and testing the authentication.
03:30	<mjr>	FernLujan, anyway, I gotta be going to bed soon, check the http://mjr.iki.fi/tmp/xorg-checklist , and after that it is simply an issue of getting the accelerated DRI driver to work at all; /var/log/Xorg.0.log should give you and/or any helpful party here some pointers
03:30	<FernLujan>	mjr: oh...
03:30	<elpargo>	fenris, yes that happens here too, their generic isn't that great :)
03:30	<cpar2>	thanks cables
03:30	<M4ri00sh>	cpar2: System -->	Preferences -->	Desktop Effects
03:30	<fenris>	cables: ack
03:30	<cpar2>	so simple, but no reference system
03:30	<cables>	fenris, did you run beryl-manager?
03:30	<cpar2>	:)
03:30	<robbie_crash>	After upgrading to Feisty one of my hard drives will not show up anywhere once ubuntu loads. It's not a hardware problem as I've got another drive on the same cable on the same controller plugged in and the other drive shows up, as does the first drive if I switch its position on the cable. It;s not just that end of the cable either, as if I only have on drive plugged in, it shows up on either end of the cable. It's only when t
03:30	<robbie_crash>	wo drives are on the same cable that one does not show up. Both are in fstab properly, and both worked perfectly before upgrading from edgy. I've reinstalled dbus, re-written them into my fstab, and remounted a bunch.
03:30	<FernLujan>	mjr: wait, how do I get to xorg.conf?
03:30	<elpargo>	cpar2, then get it ...
03:30	<FernLujan>	mjr: and how do I know where to write all those things?
03:30	<elpargo>	cpar2, I already told you how to get the toolbar back
03:30	<bofh80>	hector, cool, then you want maybe to look at cables posts, he suggests, trying beryl instead ""sudo aptitude install beryl-ubuntu"
03:31	<bofh80>	hector, oh
03:31	<bofh80>	:S
03:31	<ajehuk>	robbie_crash - ar the jumpers on the drives set correclty for maste & slave?
03:31	<fenris>	cables: yes, i did
03:31	<Generation>	Flannel, I mean that I screwed something up, so I want to install the disk again, but not lose all my info that i have downloaded
03:31	<elpargo>	cpar2, desktop-effects
03:31	<lordhelmet>	hey does anybody have any ideas to make the shutdown/restart options appear on the kde menu when using gdm? they worked for me in edgy, but after the upgrade to feisty they went away
03:31	<neilthereildeil>	what if i set the root password while suoed in with "sudo -i"
03:31	<Kakurady>	FernLujan: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.comf
03:31	<neilthereildeil>	?
03:31	<cables>	fenris, the icon isn't there? weird...
03:31	<FernLujan>	kakurady: ty
03:31	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on feisty for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?
03:31	<fenris>	cables: i meant, it IS there
03:31	<mjr>	FernLujan, sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:31	<nibsa1242>	robbie_crash some people had issues after upgrading with drives being changed from hdx to sdx
03:31	<cables>	cpar2, it looks like it's desktop effects
03:31	<ajehuk>	neilthereildeil - then your root account is active
03:31	<Flannel>	neilthereildeil: You don't need/want to set the root password.
03:31	<Kakurady>	Ha, too late!
03:31	<cables>	fenris, oh, ok :)
03:31	<rbil>	fenris: in xorg.conf do you have a line like this ... Option         "AddARGBGLXVisuals"          "true"
03:31	<robbie_crash>	ajehuk, yes. I've set them both ways
03:31	<neilthereildeil>	ok
03:31	<Flannel>	Kakurady: oh... fun.  Uh, I dont think there's a single command, you'll have to do some grepping and stuff.  You'll be using apt-cache stuff (apt-cache policy) and dpkg and stuff, I guess.
03:31	<FernLujan>	mjr: where do I write these things?
03:31	<bofh80>	fenris, hector i have some extra lines in my /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, will dig them up
03:31	<elpargo>	cpar2, cables  desktop-effects
03:32	<tbuss>	ajehuk: okay, I think you right on earlier :)
03:32	<cables>	fenris, right click, go to Advanced Options >	Rendering Platform >	AIGLX
03:32	<Kakurady>	Flannel, thanks.
03:32	<ajehuk>	robbie_crash - hmm best bet is to look at what nibsa1242 said..
03:32	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, it looks like they've been changed to sdx, but they're in fstab with uuid, not /dev/whatever
03:32	<cables>	fenris, it's something like that
03:32	<Flannel>	Kakurady: and then once youve got a list of packages, you'll pin them back to their feisty versions
03:32	<hector>	bofh80, ok
03:32	<Flannel>	!pinning | Kakurady
03:32	<ubotu>	Kakurady: pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
03:32	<nowisn>	help please grub bootdisk says error 18 selected cylinder exceeds maximum supported by bios???
03:32	<Whiz2>	bofh80: did you get my reply?
03:32	<mjr>	FernLujan, in the appropriately named sections; section Extensions might be missing, in which case just write it there
03:32	<cables>	hector, are you having problems with black/blank windows?
03:32	<neilthereildeil>	also, whenever i try to connect to a wireless network from the command line, it have to startx and go to the taskbar and tell it which network to connect to
03:32	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, and I've made sure the uuid's are the same each time I had one or the other drive load in
03:32	<SciOly>	elpargo, Flannel, I changed my apt server to the general US one from the official ubuntu one and 13 assorted updates came up in update-amanger, they're installing now and I'll try again after this for a dist upgrade button
03:32	<neilthereildeil>	how cani  avoid that?
03:32	<FernLujan>	mjr: and after I do this it should work?
03:32	<tbuss>	ajehuk: feel free to check the site out when you have time
03:32	<fenris>	cables: ok... but still no frames
03:32	<hector>	cables, no
03:32	<neilthereildeil>	i use iwconfig from cm line
03:33	<cables>	neilthereildeil, go to System>Administration>Networking and disable roaming mode for that adapter
03:33	<emet>	Will Duke Nukem Forever run on Ubuntu?
03:33	<Flannel>	SciOly: I can't imagine that'd be it.  But, we'll see I guess
03:33	<nibsa1242>	robbie_crash I've never used uuid's like that so I wouldn't know
03:33	<cables>	fenris, ok, right click on the icon, go to Select Window Decorator, and tell me what options you see.
03:33	<neilthereildeil>	and it wont work until i go to the program in thegnome toolbar and set the network name
03:33	<jrsims>	hey, anyone have a GOOD torrent link for feisty? I can't wait 15 hours to download.
03:33	<lordhelmet>	emet: totally....vaporware runs on everything
03:33	<rbil>	fenris: in xorg.conf do you have a line like this ... Option         "AddARGBGLXVisuals"          "true"
03:33	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on feisty for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?
03:33	<mjr>	FernLujan, as I said, you seem to have some issue with acceleration working at all. You need to resolve that. I somewhat suspect that you may still have traces of fglrx on your system, in which case "sudo apt-get remove .*fglrx.*" should do the trick, but there may be something else wrong too
03:33	<emet>	I heard they are using to use OpenGL 3.0 for the engine
03:33	<cables>	rbil, I was told to do the AIGLX thing, and it worked.
03:33	<SciOly>	Flannel, well at least it's pulling update-manager 0.45.3 (I had 0.45.2)
03:33	<emet>	that's cool
03:34	<Ax4>	!repeat | TomBug
03:34	<lordhelmet>	hey does anybody have any ideas to make the shutdown/restart options appear on the kde menu when using gdm? they worked for me in edgy, but after the upgrade to feisty they went away
03:34	<ubotu>	TomBug: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience

03:34	<Flannel>	fitawav: if you do those commands, and dont get any updates, youre on final.  If you do get updates, then once they install, you're on final ;)

03:35	<bofh80>	fenris, hector, run "sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" under Section "Screen" under DefaultDepth, i have the line "    Option         "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"      "   <ignore the first last quotes
03:35	<FernLujan>	mjr: okay, thank you. one last thing. in the section device, where you say "driver   "radeon", my file says "driver    "vesa". Should I change vesa to radeon, or leave vesa, and write "Driver    "radeon"" under it?
03:35	<fenris>	cables: i see three options: emerald, heliodor and GTK, emerald is selected
03:35	<cables>	noelferreira, there's a burning app built in, but I like Brasero.
03:35	<mjr>	FernLujan, oooh, yes, you should change it to radeon
03:35	<cables>	fenris, try selecting heliodor and seeing if that works better. It's not as fancy as Emerald, but it should work.
03:35	<noelferreira>	i use gnome cables
03:35	<neilthereildeil>	i dont see a check boc for roaming
03:35	<crdlb>	cables, don't you thing moving all the beryl help to #ubuntu-effects would be good ?
03:35	<neilthereildeil>	onlky for enable this devicde
03:36	<cables>	crdlb, it would be very good, let's start
03:36	<rbil>	cables: and giving the correct answers?
03:36	<cables>	noelferreira, brasero is for gnome
03:36	<fenris>	cables: doesnt help
03:36	<hector>	bofh80, i have that to but i use nividia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals to set it
03:36	<atlantia>	so.. kernel loads module for wireless card, but nothing shows up in iwconfig and i cant figure out how to "invoke" the new network manager
03:36	<cables>	rbil, what do you mean by that?
03:36	<jrsims>	hey, is anything different in XUBUNTU FEISTY?
03:36	<mjr>	FernLujan, the vesa driver is completely unaccelerated
03:36	<fenris>	cables: ill try this addargglxvisuals thing
03:36	<cables>	rbil, my answer IS correct, crdlb gave it to me in #beryl
03:37	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, even with everything as /dev/*dx it still doesn't show the one missing drive
03:37	<moDumass>	hmm, x crashed and this is the error output "failed to load module Nvidia (module does not exist, 0)
03:37	<cables>	fenris, it should already be there. If it's not, you won't even see wobbly windows.
03:37	<moDumass>	any ideas?
03:37	<rbil>	he doesn't have AddARGBGLXVisuals in his xorg.conf and that's required for windows borders
03:37	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, the one missing drive doesn't show up anywhere
03:37	<mjr>	FernLujan, so apparently your card wasn't recognized as a radeon during install; I do hope it works even so, and it was just a recognition problem
03:37	<nibsa1242>	robbie_crash I don't know what to tell you
03:37	<hector>	bofh80, everything seems to work fine except for the no-window-borders problem
03:37	<SciOly>	Flannel, nope...nothing
03:37	<FernLujan>	mjr: alright. Everything you told me is done
03:37	<Flannel>	SciOly: right.  I'd file a bug and see what they say.
03:37	<FernLujan>	mjr: do I Need a restart now or should it work?
03:38	<roler>	how do I turn on the gnome control center in feisty?
03:38	<cables>	rbil, I didn't hear him say that he didn't have that in his x.org. My answer solved part of his problems.

03:38	<linux_kid>	How do I initiate my modem to dial?
03:38	<Ax4>	moDumass, looks like you either did something wrong in /etc/X11/xorg.conf or you don't have drivers installed properly
03:38	<mjr>	FernLujan, restart X, eg. by killing it with ctrl-alt-backspace
03:38	<ajehuk>	tbuss - still here?
03:38	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, thanks anyhow!
03:38	<atlantia>	nibsa1242, heh working out wrinkles of my own
03:38	<lordhelmet>	no ideas for shutdown/restart options + kde + gdm?
03:38	<robbie_crash>	Anyone else have any ideas?

03:38	<h2o>	hello everyone, does anybody know when ubuntustudio is supposed to be released?
03:38	<fenris>	cables: it is not there...
03:38	<Ax4>	TomBug, 'lspci - v | grep Audio'
03:38	<noelferreira>	cables i use k3b. it is brasero better?
03:38	<TomBug>	ax4 only the front speaker works
03:38	<TomBug>	k
03:38	<HasratUSA>	Good evening!
03:38	<cables>	fenris, okay, so that should fix it. Add the line as rbil says, then save the file, then restart X with ctrl-alt-backspace
03:39	<Cassano>	whats the Gusty channel?
03:39	<tbuss>	ajehuk: yeah, did you not get the user and password?
03:39	<Flannel>	h2o: #ubuntu-studio, I believe
03:39	<FernLujan>	mjr: k, I'll brb
03:39	<Flannel>	Cassano: there is none currently
03:39	<ajehuk>	tbuss - eh no - how did you send it?
03:39	<cables>	noelferreira, if you use Gnome, then brasero is probably better. I don't know if it's as powerful, but the user interface is very nice.
03:39	<hector>	roler, gnome-control-center on terminal
03:39	<SciOly>	Flannel, launchpad.net/ubuntu?
03:39	<Ax4>	TomBug, sry to throw bot commands at you, but we're all trying to help as many people as possible, some of us 3 people at a time heh
03:39	<h2o>	I checked Flannel, nobody was in the channel
03:39	<Whiz2>	bofh80: the php mail interface is for sending mail only. It wants to either send from the local server (localhost) ot through an external SMTP server (ISP) The interface does not have the ability to retrieve mail from the server.
03:39	<pi-meson>	so a package I need, gtkglextmm-1.2, is missing in feisty. Someone else filed a bug on it, #104804. How do I "me too!" this bug, to encourage resolution?

03:39	<deepsa>	hey they are giving feisty cd's for free via launchpad
03:39	<TomBug>	Ax4 sure i understand
03:39	<Cassano>	Flannel why hasnt development started?
03:39	<nibsa1242>	noelferreira I use both k3b and brassero I like brassero because it doesn't complain when I burn a CD image to a DVD... I've yet to be able to figure out how to get k3b to do so (when cdrecord was the backend... maybe its different now)
03:40	<roler>	hector, but that doesn't make it appear in my menu...
03:40	<Flannel>	Cassano: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyReleaseSchedule
03:40	<Whiz2>	bofh80: would you recommend a different mail server, instead  of exim?
03:40	<noelferreira>	thanks
03:40	<noelferreira>	i'll try brasero now
03:40	<Ax4>	"Gutsy?"
03:40	<Ax4>	who comes up with these names
03:40	<ceil420>	!enlightenment
03:40	<ajehuk>	tbuss - hmm probably my client (I use bitchx and its been wierd latley) do you want to send me em again in a pm?
03:40	<ubotu>	Enlightenment (or "E") is a window manager for X, providing a useful, and good looking graphical shell in which to work. E17 is the current development version.
03:40	<hector>	roler, well you can do it manually
03:40	<tbuss>	ajehuk: sure
03:40	<fenris>	brb
03:40	<cedricshock>	This warning amused me: supported_versions: WARNING: Unknown Ubuntu release: 7.04
03:40	<ceil420>	Ax4, you should have seen some of the names the community can come up with :p
03:40	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, I'm trying to get a program compiling here and it did seems that dbus changed something cause it's not working :)
03:41	<bofh80>	Whiz2, hmm, i'm a bit lost, you want to send and recieve mail from this PHP site? yes? and you want Exim to what ? exactly for you
03:41	<HasratUSA>	deepsa guess what? I'm downloading Kubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04 and as soon as it finishes downloading I'm gonna burn it, make several copies and distribute 'em in my neighbourhood the day after tommorrow
03:41	<roler>	just got it thanks
03:41	<ceil420>	Gangrenous Gorilla was mentioned once, I think
03:41	<ceil420>	and Ganky something
03:41	<lufis>	What's Enlightenment got on Metacity?
03:41	<hector>	roler, you can go to System->Main Menu and add a new menu item
03:41	<cables>	ceil420, I'm sure that would be a great move for marketing :)
03:41	<ceil420>	:p
03:41	<Cassano>	flannel so dev starts on the 26th?
03:41	<rbil>	lufis: beauty :-)
03:41	<Ax4>	ceil420, how about 'Gullible Guppie'
03:41	<Ax4>	:p
03:41	<bofh80>	Whiz2, is the website stuff and exim on the same machine?
03:41	<elpargo>	HasratUSA, congrats
03:42	<Flannel>	Cassano: something like that
03:42	<robbie_crash>	elpargo, I guess that's a good sign? At least it means I didn't screw something up beyond repair myself
03:42	<sonictwin>	how can i edit the Applications - Places - System menu?
03:42	<hector>	roler, on the command section you write gnome-control-center
03:42	<ceil420>	i like Itchy Iguana for ubuntu+2 :p
03:42	<lufis>	rbil: oh yeah? I like clearlooks a lot
03:42	<rbil>	lufis: speed .... much much much faster

03:42	<cedricshock>	ceil420: +3 perhaps?
03:42	<hector>	roler, well the full path of that, it must be /usr/bin/gnome-control-center, let me check
03:42	<robbie_crash>	I guess O
03:42	<ajehuk>	Ax4 - blindingly quick and easy to use tho
03:42	<fenris>	ok, that did it... thx to all who helped!
03:42	<HasratUSA>	elpargo thanks
03:42	<ceil420>	Ax4, i looked it up cos that's wot Yellow Dog is using for their PS3 version

03:43	<ramin>	dang, that just looks good http://ubuntustudio.org/screenshot.png
03:43	<robbie_crash>	I guess I'm down to ripping an ide cable out of a different box and attaching one drive to ide3 and having the other stay on ide2
03:43	<g35>	hello, im having trouble changing my resolution pass 1024x768, i went into my xorg conf file and it shows i can support higher res modes...any ideas?
03:43	<fenris>	and now ill go and get rid of this window wobbling... ;)
03:43	<atlantia>	so.. how am i supposed to use the new network manager again? no cli command invokes it in gnome, and i dont have it in my menus
03:43	<nibsa1242>	you have >2 ide channels?
03:43	<Whiz2>	bofh80: I want only to send mail from the PHP site. not retrieve. The only reason I installed a mail server on my machine in the first place is so I could send mail using the PHP site without having to do so through my ISP's SMTP server. Theonly reason I want to retrieve any mail at all from the server is to keep it empty so it doesn't use up my disk space. I want to use exim (or a better server) for the sole purpose of sending mail fro

03:44	<Ax4>	ceil420, yellow dog? afraid i don't know what that is
03:44	<ramin>	<g35>, that happened with me too, I dont how to fix it, so I just reinstalled ubuntu
03:44	<intelikey>	crimsun you around ?
03:44	<SciOly>	Flannel, filed.
03:44	<ceil420>	Ax4, neither did i until someone posted a link about them developing a version for PS3
03:44	<Ax4>	ubuntustudio = vista
03:44	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, I've got 4
03:44	<Ax4>	lmao
03:44	<Ax4>	(in looks mind you)
03:44	<thornomad>	is anyone else using the .torrent for 7.04-desktop ? i started it last night and am now down to "zero" peers and have not finished downloading yet.  is that wierd on my end or just no one else out there ?
03:44	<atlantia>	cables, ok so nm-applet at cli does nada, how else can i invoke it??
03:44	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, and 4 sata
03:45	<cables>	thornomad, I'm going to start seeding now.
03:45	<cables>	atlantia, are you in gnome?
03:45	<cedricshock>	thornomad: I can seed it too.
03:45	<atlantia>	cables yes

03:45	<ramin>	I think it is on your side
03:45	<lufis>	thornomad: That sounds strange... i doubt the torrent went dead that fast
03:45	<cables>	atlantia, make sure you have a notification area on one of your panels
03:45	<Whiz2>	bofh80 if it makes this conversation easier, you can PM me on here.
03:45	<Ax4>	ceil420, got any screenies? :p
03:45	<intelikey>	general Question,  are there very many comming in here with "no sound after the upgrade" ?    and is there a known issue ?
03:45	<ramin>	there are about 60 seeds, last time I checked
03:45	<Ax4>	ceil420, ahh see ur link
03:46	<diego_>	hi, anyone knows why in the add/remove applications the flash player is disabled?? i has amd64
03:46	<thornomad>	cables and cedricshock ... thanks ... lufis ... i thought it was strange too.  and the other night, people on other irc channels were saying there were 100s of seeds.  i had a limited number.  i got it from the releases.ubuntu.com site
03:46	<pi-meson>	or can anyone recommend where I might find out why gtkglextmm was dropped from feisty ?
03:46	<Ax4>	intelikey, "lspci -v | grep Audio"
03:46	<cables>	diego_, there's your reason.
03:46	<HasratUSA>	ceil420 yes, someone has developed a linux OS for PS3, which is called YellowDog Linux and Sony has hired him to professionally develop the OS so that users and developers alike can further extend the capability of PS3
03:46	<lufis>	thornomad: check for connection issues? maybe try a different torrent client?
03:46	<atlantia>	cables, ok got it.. i added it.. hmm so now i have an issue where wireless is gone. but the kernel module looks good and it shows up in lspci..
03:46	<nibsa1242>	diego_ there is no recent flash for amd64
03:46	<ceil420>	tch neither of those "screenshots" links has any
03:46	<hector>	intelikey, i have the same problem, do you have a separate windows partition?
03:46	<dac>	how does one know if the box is 64 bit?
03:46	<intelikey>	Ax4 card is recognized but sound wont come out
03:46	<thornomad>	i tried two clients
03:46	<diego_>	cables:ok, i have a new ubuntu 7.04 system
03:46	<dominationlll>	Hello all, can I ahve some help please
03:46	<thornomad>	lufis, sorry, i tried two clients ...
03:46	<cables>	atlantia, i can't help you there.
03:46	<ceil420>	HasratUSA, and i think that's groovie :)
03:46	<intelikey>	hector no windows for me
03:46	<sonictwin>	how cani edit the applications - places - system menu?
03:46	<atlantia>	cables np ty
03:46	<Ax4>	intelikey, yea i wanna know ur soundcard lol
03:46	<cables>	diego_, flash doesn't work on amd64 systems
03:47	<sonictwin>	 under places - i want to remove two folders that were dragged there mistakenly
03:47	<lufis>	thornomad: are you using an unopened port or something?
03:47	<temujoe>	what's " >	/dev/null " mean?
03:47	<cypruser>	I'm having errors when upgrading.
03:47	<ramin>	Im bloat ware free!
03:47	<bofh80>	Whiz2, well if Exim is installed, then you can put it's name inplace of the ISP's in the PHP site?
03:47	<cables>	diego_, you need to use the i386 version
03:47	<Ax4>	intelikey, maybe it's hardware related, not software config related
03:47	<nibsa1242>	diego_ my current solution is to use a plugin for amd64 firefox that allows the use of 32bit plugins I'd tell you the name, but my 64bit box is currently half dead from upgrading to fiesty
03:47	<thornomad>	lufis ... um ... maybe ... can i change ports ?  i don't konw a thing about torrents ... was just trying it for ubuntu's sake
03:47	<dominationlll>	I have downloaded Ubuntu, and I have clicked the install program and it doesn't seem to work. It just sits there with a white window
03:47	<Jenn>	cypuser: what kind of error?
03:47	<lufis>	thornomad: are you downloading it on windows?
03:47	<robbie_crash>	even though elpargo is going to yell at me, I think I'm just going to have to reinstall totally, which isn't so bad because I've realized how badly I've butchered a lot of stuff since I first installed edgy. So starting fresh, and right might not be such a bad idea.
03:47	<hector>	intelikey, well my problem is when in windows i leave the sound in mute
03:47	<intelikey>	Ax4 can you come in kubuntu   there are three others in there with sound issues atm
03:47	<cedricshock>	thornomad: It'll take about 2 minuites for bittorrent to check that I'm not seeding you garbage.
03:47	<diego_>	cables: i have to use the npwraper ? i do this in debian
03:47	<cables>	dominationlll, it can take a while to start.
03:47	<FernLujan>	mjr: hey
03:47	<bofh80>	Whiz2, if exim is running, then it should have it's SMTP running . . . and hopefully set to do it's own lookups
03:47	<cables>	diego_, not sure... it's possible to get it working, but it's not straightforward.
03:48	<soothsay>	Is apt-cacher the best way to distribute packages to multiple machines on a network?
03:48	<diego_>	nibsa1242: ok, thanks, i goolgeit
03:48	<FernLujan>	mjr: you still here?
03:48	<cypruser>	Jenn: The updater does not download files 59 and 60.
03:48	<diego_>	cables: ok, thanks
03:48	<nowisn>	ah crap how do i put my password in the terminal
03:48	<Crema10>	whats the easiest way to update 6.10 to 7.04?
03:48	<thornomad>	lufis, no on the mac. tried transmission and the regular bittorrent (Standard) client
03:48	<dac>	where do you find out if your box is 64 bit?
03:48	<intelikey>	or any sound expert care to help in #kubuntu for a minute ?
03:48	<cables>	nowisn, it won't show up but don't worry, it's going in.
03:48	<thornomad>	lufis, transmission says ports are working
03:48	<Alonea>	ok, when I upgraded I guess the gaim upgraded too, (it looks different) but it does not work.
03:48	<Alonea>	It says "waiting for network connection" and its been that way for 20 minutes
03:48	<ramin>	is ubuntu planning to get more servers and bandwidth? their servers were so messed yesterday, nobody could upgrade, atleast, I couldn't
03:48	<reazn>	Crema10,  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
03:48	<bofh80>	Whiz2, if it's on the same machine, type localhost as the name, if it's running on the same network pop the IP or the name of the Server (assuming you have internal DNS running correctly)
03:48	<nibsa1242>	diego_ good luck to you... and so you know it didn't work right for some reason until I restated
03:48	<Whiz2>	bofh80 so how do I do that? for smtp it wants the entire server name (smtp.host.com) but it's local
03:48	<lufis>	thornomad: Strange... try manual announcing
03:48	<nowisn>	it says bad command
03:49	<bofh80>	Whiz2, try localhost
03:49	<Taime1>	have the repos changed?
03:49	<FernLujan>	mjr: :( you there man?
03:49	<Crema10>	reazn: awsome, thanks... but will I encounter any problems doing this update?
03:49	<Whiz2>	bofh80 just "localhost"?
03:49	<Taime1>	i am getting errors trying to check for updates in edgy

03:49	<hector>	no window border in compiz, i wonder why
03:49	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, just make sure you have /home on a diff partition so you don't have to do backups
03:49	<thornomad>	lufis ... hmm ... not sure how to do that
03:49	<dominationlll>	Cables: how long does it take to start?
03:49	<cables>	hector, go to #ubuntu-effects for help.
03:49	<ramin>	hector, get beryl
03:49	<madman91>	can someone help me setup my mouse ? After my upgrade to feisty my scrolly thing wont work... so after following many many many guides on google/ubuntuforums i got it to work a little.. help?

03:49	<nowisn>	actually its just live cd right now, what is the pass for root
03:49	<renato>	Hi There... I wonder if is there anyone who could give me a help on How to install ubuntu via ftp... (my cd burner is broken)...
03:50	<cables>	dominationlll, didn't take that long for me... how much ram do you have?
03:50	<lufis>	thornomad: It should be an option somewhere... alternatively try rebooting? I don't know really
03:50	<cables>	nowisn, there's no root password
03:50	<cypruser>	I get these errors when I try to upgrade Ubuntu. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16707/
03:50	<Whiz2>	bofh80 ok, but that doesn't solve the problem of how do i retrieve mail from the server to keep messages from filling up my small HDD?
03:50	<cables>	!root | nowisn
03:50	<pi-meson>	hmm, okay, it looks like the package was removed from debian
03:50	<ubotu>	nowisn: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
03:50	<dominationlll>	256mb
03:50	<hector>	ramin, no window borders in beryl either
03:50	<lufis>	thornomad: But the torrent is definitely still active
03:50	<FernLujan>	mjr: now my PC's messed
03:50	<Supaplex>	renato: what's the current os you're running?
03:50	<thornomad>	lufis ... okay ... well, i guess it is me somewhere.  glad to know it is still active.  i can try a reboot.  thanks.
03:50	<robbie_crash>	elpargo, that's one of the things I learned recently, I'm going to have one partition be / one be /var one be /home and then all the rest set as it is right now
03:50	<Crema10>	reazn: for example, will I encounter problems with Beryl which gave me so much problems to install in my laptop
03:50	<lufis>	thornomad: no prob :)
03:50	<Crema10>	doing that dist-upgrade
03:50	<cables>	dominationlll, I've run it on systems like that and it didn't take that long... does it seem to be working?
03:50	<ramin>	hector, hmm, are you using dapper?
03:50	<LordLimecat>	how does one install "GNU"....a INSTALL file tells me that make-ing it requires GNU....
03:50	<FernLujan>	can anyone help me please?
03:50	<nibsa1242>	nowisn there is no pass for root... you need to sudo xxxxx where xxx is the command to run as root... or you could sudo su (<--- not recommended)
03:50	<Taime1>	OMG im such an idiot.... i didnt type in my WEP key....HAHA
03:50	<renato>	Supaplex... I have ubuntu edgy, but I would like to make a fresh install
=== mojo__ is now known as mojo
03:51	<robbie_crash>	elpargo, I'll probably just keep my /home as it is now, unless there's a reason to not do that?
03:51	<Taime1>	nevermind on the repos
03:51	<bofh80>	Whiz2, does that work? 1 problem at a time lol
03:51	<lufis>	LordLimecat: just gnu?
03:51	<reazn>	Crema10, you have beryl on 6.10 and now you want to use 7.04 and simply upgrade?
03:51	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan what is your problem
03:51	<Whiz2>	bofh80 let me check... one moment...
03:51	<dominationlll>	Yes. It works but everything else but the installion takes awfully slow
03:51	<LordLimecat>	lufis: if yes
03:51	<LordLimecat>	thats all it says
03:51	<Crema10>	reazn: yes sir
03:51	<cedricshock>	thornomad: Problem connecting to tracker - timeout exceded. Eww.
03:51	<Samus_Aran>	anyone know how to fix this: "Searching for splash image ... none found, skipping ..."
03:51	<lufis>	LordLimecat: "You need GNU to make this app"?
03:51	<LordLimecat>	program is "fbida", if you dl the tar.gz, you can check for yer self :)
03:51	<Samus_Aran>	I have all the splash stuff installed that I could find
03:51	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, yes indeed just kill / and mount /home back
03:51	<LordLimecat>	ill paste the line into pastebin, one sec
03:51	<Crema10>	reazn: I want upgrade, but I dont want to break anything, especially my beryl
03:51	<soothsay>	Can someone tell give a quick comparison of apt-cacher versus apt-proxy (or others)?
03:51	<Supaplex>	renato: not sure on that one. got a usb stick handy?
03:52	<mojo>	I have a question...  Why is it that I can't seem to get digg.com to load in Firefox but when I try it in Konqueror it works fine?  It will eventually load in ff but only if I retry SEVERAL times.  Very annoying!
03:52	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: well, I followed one of MJR's "guides" that he posted a link to a bit earlier. if you scroll up and try to find one of MJR;s messages, he left a link on how to get the desktop effects working by modifying /etc/x11/xorg.conf
03:52	<LordLimecat>	lufis: i am possibly an idiot....it says "you need to use GNU make"
03:52	<mojo>	Or at least someone give me an idea on what I might check to see where the problem lies
03:52	<renato>	Supaplex: Yes I do... but my usb key just has 512mb
03:52	<wickedpuppy>	mojo, shouldn't you ask this to ff devs ?
03:52	<LordLimecat>	lufis: but when i use make, it throws a fit
03:52	<lufis>	LordLimecat: ah, do you have build-essential installed?
03:52	<Taime1>	mojo: ff2 has issues
03:52	<fiery_cleric>	mojo: proxy server?
03:52	<mojo>	wickedpuppy: maybe...
03:52	<reazn>	Crema10, 7.04 has desktop effects like beryl with it..
03:52	<robbie_crash>	elpargo,  thanks! Sorry I feel I have to reinstall. but I really have bunged a lot of stuff up due to ignorance
03:52	<HasratUSA>	ramin well when i started the upgrade, the 'time remaining' section of the upgrade tool's window was acting seriously crazy. Sometimes it was saying '4 hours 24 minutes remaining' and after a few seconds it said '34 hours and 44 minutes remaining'. What I did was that I simply stopped caring and went to sleep. at around 6 AM in the morning I somehow woke up and found out that everything was neatly done! the upgrade tool nicely cleaned
03:52	<nowisn>	holy frig is there an idiot ubuntu channel?
03:52	<HasratUSA>	up previous files, upgraded old packages, installed new ones and restarted
03:52	<LordLimecat>	lufius: just overwrote my old edgy, so, maybe not?
03:52	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: Well, I did everything he told me to do, and now my computer won't load graphically. it says that server x failed to initialize, so all I Have is my console.
03:53	<steb>	How do I install update the ubuntu kernel from a live CD?
03:53	<reazn>	Crema10, what i would do is disable the beryl lines you put in system >	preferences >	sessions
03:53	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan, sorry making eye candy work properly is not something I'm good at it always crashes too much on my computer... oh wait I have an idea
03:53	<LordLimecat>	lufius: i will now :)
03:53	<LordLimecat>	thank you
03:53	<reazn>	then dist-upgrade
03:53	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: now I'm using my ubuntu CD to be on gaim
03:53	<lufis>	:)
03:53	<mojo>	fiery_cleric: no proxy, unless my isp has a transparent one i don't know of... but then konq would be hit by that too.  actually, sometimes using TOR on will make digg.com load when having it off won't... though not today
03:53	<wickedpuppy>	nowisn, still having your password problem ?
03:53	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: what's the idea?
03:53	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, yup you have learn your lesson, resintalling is the last option :p
03:53	<Crema10>	reazn: 7.04 has effects like beryl!!??! wow! So we dont need Beryl anymore?
03:53	<Supaplex>	renato: I know debian has a way to install etch via usb key by placing the iso with the startup misc on it.  can you boot from usb?
03:53	<cedricshock>	steb: Upgrading an existing installation can be done with the upgrade manager (from the running system) or from the /alternate/ install cd.
03:53	<fiery_cleric>	mojo: TOR?
03:53	<cables>	dominationlll, lol
03:54	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan ok... look I imagine that part of what you did was to edit xorg.conf right?
03:54	<dominationlll>	cables is my cd messed up?
03:54	<ramin>	<HasratUSA>	that's great
03:54	<reazn>	Crema10, no, you don't need beryl :)
03:54	<cables>	@lart dominationlll
03:54	<robbie_crash>	back in an hour or so!
03:54	<atlantia>	scott@haruko:~$ sudo modprobe -r ipw3945
03:54	<atlantia>	sh: /sbin/ipw3945d-2.6.20-15-generic: not found
03:54	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: yep
03:54	<cables>	dominationlll, it could be, run the integrity test from the livecd boot screen.
03:54	<HasratUSA>	Crema?
03:54	<mojo>	fiery_cleric: eff.org  TOR (The Onion Router) anonymizing proxy net
03:54	<atlantia>	can anyone tell me why the module for this kernel for 3945 is missing from an upgrade?
03:54	<cedricshock>	!upgrade >	steb
03:54	<Crema10>	reazn: oh wow! thats awsome... ok one more question, I installed A LOT Of things via Automatix, will I encounter problems with that?
03:54	<temujoe>	what's "somecommand >	/dev/null " mean?
03:54	<anarchron>	hey guys
03:54	<DagonX>	are Ubuntu servers working?
03:54	<HasratUSA>	Crema what Feisty wants to call 'desktop effect' is Compiz
03:54	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan and I would assume that before you edited it you make a back up by doing something like cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.desktope.bak
03:54	<cables>	Crema10, quite possibly.
03:54	<cables>	!slow | DagonX
03:54	<ubotu>	DagonX: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
03:54	<anarchron>	how do I find the logs for network manager in feisty?
03:54	<lufis>	temujoe: it sends it to /dev/null
03:55	<mojo>	Taime1: ff2 "issues"?  where can i read up on that more?
03:55	<reazn>	Crema10, as long as you make sure your system is upto date, before you do the dist-upgrade - you should be fine.
03:55	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan all you need to do is to restore from the backup
03:55	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: no, he didn't tell me anything like that
03:55	<moDumasser>	hey all, whats the easiest way to make my TV out work on my Nvidia fx5950ultra? I know its quite an old card but it should still be able to handle the load
03:55	<cables>	DagonX, go to System>Administration>Software Sources and select another source server.
03:55	<temujoe>	lufis: and /dev/null = ?
03:55	<lufis>	temujoe: basically it's a way to dump something that isn't needed
03:55	<ramin>	i know, I thought there was a poll and beryl got more votes, so why did they put compiz in instead?
03:55	<Whiz2>	bofh80 according to the php interface, there were no errors. i won't know for sure whether i received it for a lil while.
03:55	<KalleDK>	!torrents
03:55	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about torrents - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
03:55	<cables>	ramin, more stable i guess
03:55	<temujoe>	lufis: aah, ok, thanks.
03:55	<KalleDK>	!torrents
03:55	<ubotu>	Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
03:55	<reazn>	Crema10, sudo apt-get update // sudo apt-get upgrade // then do a: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
03:55	<Whiz2>	bofh80 i'm assuming it worked
03:55	<fiery_cleric>	mojo: ok... um... maybe create a new profie ... dont know really
03:55	<ramin>	ah
03:55	<cedricshock>	DagonX: Frontier whatever has been fast for me, and seems to be up-to-date.
03:55	<renato>	Supaplex... Yes I can... I found another day a site with a few "image files" to make it, but I have to create with PCLinux OS (for ubuntu I need 1 gb at least)
03:55	<LordLimecat>	lufius: er...still throwin a fit
03:55	<LordLimecat>	lemme pastebin
03:55	<DagonX>	will do just wanted to make sure the problem wasn't at my end
03:55	<DagonX>	Thanks
03:55	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: so I guess I don't have a backup...
03:55	<LordLimecat>	!paste | LordLimecat
03:55	<lufis>	temujoe: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/null
03:55	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan... well that sucks then anytime I text edit an important file I always make a backup so that I can restore quickly
03:55	<wickedpuppy>	temujoe, /dev/null is a void ... it sux everything up .. for mroe info pls google on it.. basically nothing ever escapes from it
03:55	<conn>	hi, where do I make a request for a package to be updated via feisty-updates? Network-Manager 0.6.5 was released yesterday and it'd be good to included in Feisty
03:56	<mojo>	fiery_cleric: well that is worth a shot!
03:56	<Crema10>	reazn: ok thanks man, i appreciate it!
03:56	<nowisn>	okay tried tryping in grub in the terminal and it gives me error 27 unrecognized command?
03:56	<SubMOA>	Ohayo all!
03:56	<bofh80>	Whiz2, lol ok. now, what's this mailbox stuff, you have an email pop3 box on your ISP and you just want to empty it, you don't want to read the emails?
03:56	<Taime1>	mojo: for some reason, konqueror is doing a better job of emulating IE... i have found this to be the case on several websites... i guess im talking mostly from recent experisnce, but i have also found several others online that feel the same way
03:56	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: I don't know pretty much anything. so I was just doing what this guy told me to do
03:56	<nowisn>	okay tried tryping in grub in the terminal and it gives me error 27 unrecognized command?
03:56	<temujoe>	lufis: thx wickedpuppy: thx too
03:56	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan did you erase things in the xorg config file or just comment (###) them out?
03:56	<Taime1>	experienceS*
03:56	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: I remember something about editing some xorg.0. something file in /var/ or something like that... if it sounds familiar
03:56	<mojo>	Taime1: but digg.com is not something i would expect to be IE centric
03:56	<cypruser>	I having errors upgrading to Feisty. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16707/
03:56	<fiery_cleric>	error 27 thats helpfull....
03:56	<LordLimecat>	lufius:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16708/
03:56	<wickedpuppy>	temujoe, those technical terms can be usually be easily found on the net ... its sometimes frustrating to ask here unless its a technical problem ...
03:56	<Whiz2>	bofh80 the mailbox i want to empty is the one i have in exim. i somehow managed to get email since i installed it
03:56	<reazn>	Crema10, no worriessss
03:57	<LordLimecat>	am i possibly missing more?
03:57	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: just added new things, and changed the Driver variable from vesa to radeon
03:57	<infidel>	!upgrade
03:57	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
03:57	<Crema10>	reazn: let me do that now, please cross your fingers for me, here goes nothing  :)
03:57	<temujoe>	wickedpuppy: roger that, I'll be more self-sufficient :)
03:57	<Supaplex>	renato: try http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch02s02.html.en#id2530967 but with an ubuntu cd.  Is there a minicd1 for feisty?
03:57	<wickedpuppy>	temujoe, welcome to the geek-club :P
03:57	<temujoe>	hehe
03:57	<Flannel>	!minimal | Supaplex
03:57	<ubotu>	Supaplex: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
03:58	<Whiz2>	bofh80 but i want to access from a different computer on the network. (through my LAN as opposed to through the internet, or from the locahost)
03:58	<bofh80>	Whiz2, LOL, erm, exaclty how do you know you have recieved email?
03:58	<cpare>	Hello again all
03:58	<renato>	Supaplex: I dont know... let me check it out...
03:58	<lufis>	cpare: hello :)
03:58	<josh__>	is anyone having problems with grub not loading
03:58	<steb>	cedricshock: I updated my kernel to feisty and it will not boot.  None of my alternate kernels will boot.  I need upgrade from 2.6.20-15.x to 2.6.20-15.27. Thanks.
03:58	<fenris>	omg, beryl is cool 8)
03:58	<bofh80>	Whiz2, you want to access which part? the PHP site or pop3 ?
03:58	<Whiz2>	bofh80 i logged into my user from the console, and as soon as I did, i saw the message "You've got mail!"
03:58	<Supaplex>	renato: like ubotu says. minimal should fit.
03:58	<cpare>	thanks for the help earlier with the Desktop Effects
03:58	<FernLujan>	dibsa1242: does "/var/" ... "xorg.0"... sound familiar to you at all?
03:58	<cpare>	I am gonna stay away from it for a while
03:58	<HasratUSA>	I found the default 'desktop effect' thingy that came preinstalled with feisty fawn serioulsy lacking in standard and features. if i have to say a single reason to quickly describe why it sucks in my opinion, i would say that i still haven't found a GUI app preinstalled in Feisty to configure Compiz, or your 'desktop effects'. Yes I know what you're saying! "I can go to System menu, choose 'desktop effects' and enable/tick 'woobly
03:58	<HasratUSA>	windows' and '3d desktop workspaces'. but those are the only two you will get along with some minimizing and maximizing effects as well as some plugins. but again, you won't be able to configure it using a GUI app, whereas Beryl is just complete, neat and comes with one hell of a wonderful GUI configuration manager
03:58	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan, ok well if you can remember exactly what file that was you should be able to edit it and remove the new things (just put a # or mutiple ### in front of any line you added to comment it out (I think # is the comment character, not exactly sure maybe someone else can help)) OR there should be a command to reconfigure X but I can't remember it
03:58	<cpare>	next release will be better
03:58	<cpare>	:)
03:58	<Whiz2>	bofh80 my exim inbox (exim doesn't come with pop3)
03:58	<lufis>	fenris: yep... the selling point of vista for free :)
03:59	<Crema10>	reazn: actually one more question, will I see any performance decrease doing this upgrade, as opposed to doing it a clean 7.10 install?
03:59	<LordLimecat>	anyone have a second for a "make" problem?  trying to make "fbida" and its throwin errors: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16708/
03:59	<josh__>	why does it say error to load operating system where grub is suppose to pop up
03:59	<atlantia>	FYI if you upgrade, and your intel 3945 wireless card is gone, it is because you have to install the resticted modules package, even if yo
03:59	<bofh80>	Whiz2, ?! 1 sec lol
03:59	<Whiz2>	bofh80 ok
03:59	<Supaplex>	HasratUSA: patches welcome.
03:59	<reazn>	Crema10, i did an upgrade rather than a fresh install and it seems to be fine.
03:59	<infidel>	can you apt-get upgrade to 7.04?
03:59	<xtknight>	!upgrade | infidel
03:59	<ubotu>	infidel: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
03:59	<reazn>	infidel, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
03:59	<Crema10>	reazn: ok then, i'll give it a shot.. got nothint to lose, thanks man :)
03:59	<lufis>	LordLimecat: Have you got all the dependencies installed?
04:00	<reazn>	Crema10, have funnn
04:00	<FernLujan>	dibsa1242: I'll ask someone else then
04:00	<FernLujan>	ty
04:00	<mojo>	HasratUSA: Beryl is a fork of Compiz, and one of the things it has going for it is the config editor (though it is waaaay saturated with settings that should be on 'advanced' tabs).  Compiz and Beryl are re-merging thankfully so the future looks bright.
04:00	<cpare>	HasratUSA - doesn't matter as compiz and Beryl are merging
04:00	<infidel>	reazn, thanks
04:00	<cpare>	once again
04:00	<reazn>	nps
04:00	<cpare>	HasratUSA - check the compiz homepage
04:00	<fenris>	lufis: plus the stylish apple-cube :)
04:00	<lufis>	fenris: yup :)
04:00	<LordLimecat>	lufius: im not really sure, but it doesnt list any
04:00	<FernLujan>	Can anyone help me with a server X problem?
04:00	<cpare>	HasratUSA - seems compiz is more stable, but beryl is more bling
04:00	<lufis>	LordLimecat: what are you compiling again?
04:01	<cpare>	HasratUSA - so we get the best of both worlds
04:01	<LordLimecat>	lufis: im at that stage where im trying to get used to building programs myself, but still sort of confused
04:01	<LordLimecat>	fbida
04:01	<nowisn>	Ty but i'm givin up, bye
04:01	<LordLimecat>	http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/
04:01	<axiom>	anyone know when feisty+1 will be out? and what exactly feisty+1 means?
04:01	<NeoTheOne->	huammm
04:01	<steb>	anyone: I updated my kernel to feisty and it will not boot.  None of my alternate kernels will boot.  I need upgrade from 2.6.20-15.x to 2.6.20-15.27. Thanks.
04:01	<NeoTheOne->	hi all
04:01	<lufis>	LordLimecat: ah, thats ok... it's a simple process once you get the hang of it, especially with ubuntu's awesome repos
04:01	<Whiz2>	bofh80 confirmed! The email i just sent from the PHP interface was received at the email address i sent it to
04:01	<HasratUSA>	reazn i did the same as well. nothing has seriously gone haywire so far lol and i'm keeping my fingers crossed. previously I promised to myself that edgy was all I needed in my life and that I would never have to upgrade to Feisty. however i couldn't just resist it when people went crazy over Feisty and servers got massive hits lol. so i decided to take the risk and do the upgrade
04:01	<setuid>	What's the name of the app that shows me the volume up/down graphic when I use the volume buttons on my laptop?
04:01	<wickedpuppy>	axiom, that means the next version after feisty ???
04:01	<mojo>	cpare: my understanding is that compiz dev has been slower to adopt cutting edge stuff b/c they want to get the architecture done "right" from the beginning, and avoid the hackish code.
04:02	<Rolando>	Ax4  Could you paste again the http page for bugs in kernel, Im sorry i forgetit... tks ... please
04:02	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan I think I found the comman you need. It should be sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg do that from the command line and hopefully all will be well.
04:02	<bofh80>	Whiz2, cool, just flickin thru some Exim docs lol. Err what ubuntu are you running on that machine?
04:02	<josh__>	what is up with fiesty and grub
04:02	<reazn>	HasratUSA, i found there were still a few little bugs in edgy.. that seem to be fixed in feisty.. i'll always stick with the latest version
04:02	<Supaplex>	renato: http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch04s04.html.en looks more relavant. be sure to backup your memory stick someplace safe if you need the contents.
04:02	<josh__>	on a clean install
04:02	<cpare>	mojo - seems to be, I was reading the same - Novell was the force behind compiz
04:02	<Whiz2>	bofh80 kubuntu - dapper release
04:02	<setuid>	compiz, blech
04:02	<setuid>	Works on like 5% of machines
04:02	<cpare>	mojo - and then the open source community forked it to add bling
04:02	<axiom>	wickedpuppy, i'm just not sure if it means the next major release or something less major. as it is, my system will not update to feisty because i don't have 50MB of free space on my /boot partition (only 40MB)
04:03	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: can I do that from the terminal here while using the ubuntu CD?
04:03	<cpare>	mojo - it will be nice to see them come together
04:03	<lufis>	LordLimecat: Hm... have you looked in the readme for any?
04:03	<nibsa1242>	Both compiz and beryl crash on me way too much... but I blame it on XGL since I've an ATI card
04:03	<josh__>	anyone else have fiesty and grub problems
04:03	<lufis>	LordLimecat: generally the devs list them
04:03	<mojo>	cpare: well actually it seems that a dev employed by novell but he claims to take his own counsel, not 'directed' by novell
04:03	<slop>	is there a way to see a log of all the messages that pop up in tty1 during boot?
04:03	<LordLimecat>	lufis: ill check again....do i need gcc?
04:03	<cpare>	nibsa1242 - I have to agree
04:03	<wickedpuppy>	axiom, i don't remember ubuntu having a minor release between major releases .. whats the minor release between dapper and edgy ??
04:03	<lufis>	LordLimecat: yes, but it's included in the build-essential metapackage
04:03	<mojo>	cpare: agreed
04:03	<setuid>	nibsa1242, There's a HOWTO that explains how to get that working with AIGLX
04:03	<LordLimecat>	again, this is a fresh install...formatted old edgy where i did my early compiles

04:04	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan, no I think you'll need to boot into the system... or chroot

=== josh__ is now known as kalifonria909
04:04	<cpare>	nibsa1242 - I have had bad luck with beryl, and compiz blew me up just now on Feisty
04:04	<HasratUSA>	reazn yes, first of all it's got more faster than dapper and edgy and there is absolutely no doubt about that. secondly several issues, including the most serious one that severely frustrated wireless internet users, are gone now, most probably, and i'm saying 'most probably' because i don't have an wireless card and hence i can't test it but i bet i'm gonna buy one sooner or later now to see if wireless features are now working outta
04:04	<HasratUSA>	the box
04:04	<mojo>	nibsa1242: i use aiglx with the opensource radeon driver no problems.  i don't game so the slower fps doesn't bother me for now
04:04	<nibsa1242>	setuid, yeah, but then my X800 XL doesn't get to use all its nice features
04:04	<kalifonria909>	can anyone help me with fiesty
04:04	<NeoTheOne->	I am install fiesty today, but i have problem with wifi, i just got 46% signal streng :(
04:04	<setuid>	nibsa1242, Read the howto, yes it does.
04:04	<LordLimecat>	kalifonria909: whats the problem?
04:04	<kalifonria909>	i cant get fiesty to boot
04:04	<Malachi>	I'm trying to upgrade Feisty on someone's laptop, but the Update Manager isn't finding the update.
04:05	<corevette>	what packages attach apache with mysql/php?
04:05	<nibsa1242>	setuid anyhow, the os radeon driver and I have issues
04:05	<renato>	Supaplex: thank you very much for your help, but I couldn't find any minimun ubuntu 7.04 iso file to put in my usb key
04:05	<cpare>	Kalifornia909 - what you got
04:05	<setuid>	nibsa1242, Such as?
04:05	<nibsa1242>	setuid it doesn't work right so I'm stuck installing in alternate CD land
04:05	<Whiz2>	bofh80 brb there is an issue in my house... (afk)
04:05	<setuid>	nibsa1242, "doesn't work right" is too vague. Please point me to the bug reports you've filed, so I can read up on them.
04:06	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: Alright man, thanks a bunch. I'll ttyl
04:06	<scot524>	corvette, i think it is libapache2-mod-php
=== konami is now known as konami__
04:06	<nibsa1242>	setuid otherwise I get the dreaded gdm no screens found error... its a known bug the work around is to drop to a console and fix xorg.conf or install with alternate cd
04:06	<NeoTheOne->	I am install fiesty today, but i have problem wifi with chipset atheros,  i just got 46% signal streng,
04:06	<Azureday>	is anyone using BCM4318 wireless adapter here?
04:07	<Azureday>	It doesn't work in feisty
04:07	<lmosher>	Just updated my nvidia beta driver using alberomilone.net's "envy" program on fiesty. X crashes with this error: API mismatch: the NVIDIA kernel module has the version 1.0-9755, but this X module has the version 1.0-9631. Please make sure blah blah they're all the same"
04:07	<Azureday>	although it seems to be recognized
04:07	<lmosher>	Which package is it talking about? How do I update it? :)
04:07	<scot524>	corvette, or libapache3-mod-php5 (assuming u have apache2 and php5)

04:07	<HasratUSA>	Imosher did you know alberto hasn't released a version of envy compatible for Feisty yet because he is busy with studies?
04:07	<Toma->	Props to the "ubuntu-restricted-extras" package!!! Sweeeet!
04:08	<seven5_>	i'm trying to get digital out from vlc, and i'm just getting pops, like its not decoding it right, anyone ever seen that?

04:08	<eck>	lmosher: so the kernel module is too new fo ubuntu

04:08	<ubotu>	renato: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
04:08	<TashKavarish>	I have a problem getting 1920x1200 working, its specified in xorg.conf but for some reason the logs shows its not valid

04:08	<Kraeloc_>	it had to be said...
04:09	<kalifonria909>	does the default grub detect raid arrays
04:09	<TashKavarish>	even a regenarated xorg.conf hasnt changed anything, neither has adding a modeline
04:09	<lmosher>	HasratUSA, Hm.. someone made a mistake on the fiesty version of ubuntuguide.org then! Normally I install the stuff myself, but ubuntuguide told me that the directions below were fishy and I should use albert's
04:09	<Supaplex>	Kraeloc_: it's unix for unics
04:09	<Michael>	Hi everyone.
04:09	<nibsa1242>	setuid while not the same card its related to the problems I've seen with my X800... only with the X800 Edgy had that problem after install where gdm couldn't be found
04:09	<lufis>	hi michael :)
04:09	<cpare>	Kraeloc - I am not so sure,
04:09	<Jordan_U>	kalifonria909, If they are true hardware RAID, yes
04:09	<lmosher>	HasratUSA: Ok so anyway, how do I repair this?

04:12	<lmosher>	HasratUSA, I'm happy you know all about Albertomilone's life. Do you also know how I can fix my problem?
04:12	<eck>	lmosher: of course you can try to upgrade X, but that would be very nontrivial
04:12	<HasratUSA>	Hell i can't wait to buy and plant a wireless card in my desktop and reproduce some problems that some of you are having. what would be the most incompatible wireless card i should buy to challange myself?
04:12	<nu->	Is there a task-bar addon that shows mem/cpu usage?
04:12	<seamus7>	atlantia: have you enabled it in Networking or through the Network Manager
04:12	<lmosher>	eck: I'm sure I can reverse it, I've done more :/
04:13	<TashKavarish>	so can anyone help me get 1920x1200 working ?
04:13	<lmosher>	eck: though I shouldn't have used that automated program. I never like doing crap like that considering I don't know what it did exactly, it's hard to undo
04:13	<HasratUSA>	LMFAO Imosher well you can say I am a huge fan of Alberto. He has made life for nVIDIA and ATI owners so easy!
04:13	<pimpnasty>	Is there a memory adress editor like tsearch or money editor for linux
04:13	<mojo>	knix_: nx runs a 'x server' on the server and sends compressed update info to the client-end, and has a design that attempts to remove much of the latency inherent in the x protocol

04:14	<knix_>	mojo, I appreciate that.   Im just not really getting the jist of it.  I installed the server, but what about the clients?   Does a client connect to the server, then what?
04:14	<seamus7>	cypruser: I used the Alternate CD to upgrade
04:14	<atlantia>	seamus7, doesn't show up, even though the module is loaded, and a new set of processes have shown up in ps -A

04:15	<ep2011>	for partitioning, should I do 10 gb for / and 70 for /home? any ideas? i have 250 gb to share with windows and ubuntu
04:15	<HasratUSA>	Imosher I don't know but I'm trying to know. I recommend that you be patient while we delve deep into your problem :-D
04:15	<cypruser>	seamus7: Will it overwrite my current configurations?
04:15	<seamus7>	atlantia: hmmm i'm on ipw3945 and it worked by default on feisty
04:15	<mojo>	knix_: yeah, you need the nomachine nx client for linux to talk to the nxserver on the machine you want to connect to
04:15	<eck>	lmosher: it's really a problem with nvidia. upstream X.org makes changes to X11, and the changes require updated drivers. I guess nvidia hasn't released drivers that are new enough, and their beta drivers must track CVS or something like that
04:15	<mojo>	knix_: nomachine is the company behind nx
04:15	<seamus7>	cypruser: no
04:16	<knix_>	mojo, so the server just sits there and directs to the clients?  I know about nomachine, but no one is answering me on there
04:16	<Crema10>	reazn: i did what you said, apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and then apt-get dist-upgrade... but when i did the last part, it doesnt do anything...

04:16	<mig96>	I'm a total noob, so please don't laugh.  So I start Feisty, and then the mouse moves, but won't click or when I mouse over something nothing shows up.  Why?  (This is Ubuntu, so it's Gnome not Kubuntu)
04:17	<crdlb>	Terramel, use 915resolution
04:17	<HasratUSA>	by any chance is google.com down tonight?
04:17	<Crema10>	reazn: it reads packages, building dependecies, reads state ifnormation then calculates upgrade, but after that it does nothing

04:21	<ep2011>	vox754 what would be the point of  seperate /usr, /var and /boot

04:22	<TokenBad>	ok been trying to install this new ubuntu and after got the root stuff sorted it goes to mounting the swap part..and says it can't and fails..I have removed it...remade it...2 or 3 times and always get the same responce when I go to install...
04:22	<eck>	ep2011: if you want you can use LVM and grow out the space later on, but I only use ~6GB for all of / (not including/home) in total, so i'm not sure if it's worth it
04:22	<fucter>	slackware.com
04:22	<HasratUSA>	Son-Riab hell with torrents. get 'em all from FTP
04:22	<Jack3>	jordan_u, so i clicked manual, and it takes me to a list of partitoins called PrePare Partitions
04:22	<damian>	It doesn't do anything hasrat, after I installed feisty was working but now it's not
04:22	<Jack3>	so i dunno what to do from there
04:22	<ep2011>	eck LVM?
04:22	<TokenBad>	can anyone help me get this to install?
04:23	<Stoffer>	do you guys know of an app that preferrably closes another application at a scheduled time?  I'd settle for one that'll shut down my system.
04:23	<mojo>	damian: you mean with the traditional workspace switcher?  compiz/beryl use 'viewports' and the ws switcher sees them as one big wide workspace.  i have my cube with 4 viewports but ws switcher set to one wkspace
04:23	<vox754>	ep2011, /boot could hold all your kernels.    /usr is where most applications are installed, actually you may have a 2 GB / but a 15 /usr , /var could hold temporary data like mail and temporary files, also if you wish /tmp
04:23	<pimpnasty>	Is there a memory adress editor like tsearch or money editor for linux

04:23	<mojo>	damian: but the end result looks and operaties like a ws switcher with 4 wkspaces
04:23	<damian>	maybe I change something in the config?

04:25	<HasratUSA>	aburton i personally wouldn't care to boot windows after seeing what GNU/Linux has to offer and how it changes one's life. but anyways there is a how-to on how to fix grub after you knowingly mess it up by installing winblows after GNU/Linux
04:25	<Hess>	lol
04:25	<mojo>	BrandonG_: <grin>
04:25	<Hess>	thats funny brandon
04:25	<slyfox>	ZombiekE: you have to unmounit first with gparted before uou can do anything with it

04:26	<Khoix>	where's the list of current processes in gnome?
04:26	<BrandonG_>	So I take that as a no
04:26	<eck>	pimpnasty: you can edit it with whatever you want (if you are root)
04:26	<Azureday>	of course

04:26	<rbil>	Khoix: system monitor
04:26	<usser>	Khoix: command top
04:26	<Azureday>	and grub is at default being installed on MBR at installtion
04:26	<aburton>	HasratUSA:  everything worked fine until I installed feisty over my edgy install
04:26	<slyfox>	ZombiekE: then you have to either burn a gparted iso and have this disk for future and use it now and boot form it and resize your partition, or boot with the live cd and use gparted from there
04:26	<ep2011>	okay, im about to do it, i think ill just do / 10gb and /home 80gb, does that sound fine?

04:27	<vox754>	ep2011, yeah, but trust me, and create other partitions, like /media/DATA just as a backup, since you have a lot of space.
04:27	<damian>	Hasrat i must deleted something because before it worked
04:28	<TashKavarish>	Hess:  thanks for replying, at least i know someone seens this now :)

04:31	<swedekid>	seamus7: no, tried a couple, didnt work, ill try the other ones now
04:31	<LordLimecat>	TokenBad: just so you know, you CAN install stuff on a live CD (it gets  installed to ram).....gparted is good for diagnostic
04:31	<cypruser>	Ubuntu should be more like Windows.
04:31	<LordLimecat>	lol?

04:33	<vox754>	ep2011, well I don't think so, supposedly /boot maybe independent and even shared by different distros, because it only holds the kernel and the boot loader, which may work with any Linux

04:37	<crdlb>	hrp2171, what version of the nvidia drivers?
04:37	<eck>	Vessquire: what are you trying to do that makes you not want to user a router?
04:37	<vox754>	ep2011, remember you also need the swap one, a 1 GB will do
04:37	<root__>	soothsay: building a router? you mean a firewall? I'm not sure if its feasible with ubuntu. Check out smoothwall
04:37	<hrp2171>	crdlb, im using what the ubuntu repos gave me.  should i be using nvidia's direct download instead?
04:38	<ep2011>	vox754: Thanks, I already have a 1 GB swap from edgy. :)
04:38	<Malachi>	Pelo: I'm trying that.
04:38	<crdlb>	hrp2171, on feisty?
04:38	<eck>	Vessquire: at the very least your router will have more ethernet ports
04:38	<cypruser>	I am getting this error message whenever I try to upgrade. "Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)"
04:38	<Drenhead>	 I just installed Feisty and am having a problem with an external harddrive. it mounts it to /media/Backup but says I don't have access rights to it when I try to get into it.
04:38	<hrp2171>	dapper
04:38	<Malachi>	Pelo: But the Update Manager does nothing
04:38	<Azureday>	you're right
04:38	<witless>	hi.  when i turn on desktop effects my window manager disappears.  it's a system76 laptop with a nvidia GeForce Go 7600.  any recommendations?
04:38	<root__>	drenhead: what is it formatted as
04:38	<soothsay>	root__: Building a router with Ubuntu is definitely feasible. I just wanted to know if their is a guide
04:38	<Cactyii1>	I keep getting timeout exceeded when connecting to tracker when trying to download a torrent... anybody able to explain this?
04:38	<witless>	(i'm using feisty)
04:38	<seamus7>	swedekid: if you're on Feisty you can go to System/Preferences/Hardware Information
04:38	<crdlb>	hrp2171, you need at least version 9xxx to configure twinview with nvidia-settings
04:38	<wastrel>	my xchat has a weird font
04:38	<Pelo>	Malachi,  are you staring from  edgy or dapper ?  cause you can't upgrade to fiesty from dapper
04:38	<fiveiron>	hey, i've got a 3com ethernet card... its lighting up, and the 3com driver is being loaded at boot time, but the device isn't showing up in ifconfig, and i can't start it with /etc/networking
04:38	<Vessquire>	eck, the router I have is a wireless router... I prefer to use it as an access point though and not a router... that way I can monitor traffic with wireshark on the gateway
04:38	<Drenhead>	NTFS
04:38	<Malachi>	Edgy >	Feisty, Pelo
04:38	<kingcobra>	how do u install a device? i installed serialmonkey driver rt2570 for my usb adaptor but it still says rausb0:no such device
04:38	<root__>	soothsay: I don't know of a guide. thats a bit beyond me
04:39	<fiveiron>	any idea why that might be happening?
04:39	<crdlb>	hrp2171, what card?
04:39	<Pelo>	Malachi,   clean install then,  get the cd
04:39	<hrp2171>	crdlb, yeah i think the dapper repos only have the 87xx
04:39	<fiveiron>	or what i can do about it
04:39	<Malachi>	Pelo, uh, no.
04:39	<swedekid>	seamus7: yea i found it, its Intel Corporation 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 03), anyone know how to get it to work :/
04:39	<hrp2171>	geforece 7600gs
04:39	<hrp2171>	pci-x
04:39	<dtholden>	any way when i have my wireless networking, for ubuntu to stop asking for a keyring password on start up on 7.04?
04:39	<Malachi>	Pelo: 1) Not my PC, I need to _upgrade_
04:39	<scot524>	seamus7: thanks hwinfo is pretty cool, i've only had feisty for a few hours
04:39	<crdlb>	hrp2171, you can use the "latest driver" repository here: http://albertomilone.com/driver.html
04:39	<Drenhead>	root_:  before I upgraded, it would let me in with no problems.
04:39	<duckie>	is there a work around to feisty sda hda kernel problem where it fails to pick hard drives...?
04:39	<eck>	Vessquire: you can pass the traffic through another computer and still have the router doing the routing things
04:40	<Vessquire>	soothsay: you will want to use iptables... I remember doing this before... look here: http://linux.about.com/od/ubusrv_doc/a/ubusg18t03.htm
04:40	<fiveiron>	nevermind
04:40	<fiveiron>	lol
04:40	<Pelo>	Malachi,   I don'T have anyting to suggest behond what is in that guide,  execpt trying with the alterante install cd , you can upgrade from that
04:40] -fellacious:#ubuntu- You have new messages, type /s read 1 to view them
04:40	<eck>	Vessquire: although if you can you would just be best off getting a router that you can put linux on and writing an iptables policy that forwards interesting traffic to another computer for logging/analysis
04:40	<kingcobra>	eck do you know how to install a device? i installed serialmonkey driver rt2570 for my usb adaptor but it still says rausb0:no such device
04:40	<root__>	drenhead: You cannot write to NTFS without special software that might have gotten removed when you upgraded. If its ntfs you will need to reinstall the software
04:41	<Vessquire>	eck, why do you care how my network is set up? All I asked is if there was a guide for feisty and nat...
04:41	<Drenhead>	i don't want to write to the drive, just access data that is on it.
04:41	<soothsay>	Vessquire: Yeah thanks. I've done it before with another distro. I'm reinstalling and trying to update my software packages (dnsmasq?)
04:41	<swedekid>	whats it mean "You have new messages, type /s read 1 to view them"?
04:41	<root__>	drenhead: oh
=== Cactyii1 is now known as Cactii1
04:41	<Dasnipa`>	swedekid, its a spammer ignore them
04:41	<swedekid>	oh
04:41	<Vessquire>	soothsay, I think iptables is installed by default
04:41	<eck>	Vessquire: because I have done it before, and it is a major PITA. If you want to do it, just google for iptables NAT
04:41	<Dasnipa`>	fellacious needs to be banned
04:41	<shigutso>	my mouse is almost-working: scroll ok, but no mouse3 click... in ubuntu 6.06 it worked fine, but not here in 7.04... what's the problem??

04:42	<william>	root__: doesn't feisty have rw ntfs support ?
04:42	<TokenBad>	ok the error I get when trying to make the drive ext3 after making free space on a ext3 drive  is check file system on /dev/hda1 for errors and fix if possible...any help with this?
04:42	<Vessquire>	eck, I have done it before too... its not that big of a deal, and its easier for me to screw around with iptables or some other software rather than this stupid router interface
04:42	<Pelo>	swedekid,  dbl click the sound icon in the top bar,  make sure nothing is muted,   check under file >	change device, try the other one
04:42	<poningru>	finalburn: whatsup?
04:42	<finalburn>	ive just installed imbuntu 6.10 on a panasonic toughbook cf-18
04:42	<nalioth>	Dasnipa`: why is that?
04:43	<finalburn>	mousepad on labtop not working right
04:43	<Hess>	lol final
04:43	<rellik>	woah! I tried to run 'hwinfo' cause I saw it mentioned on the channel..  and instead of just saying 'command not found', it told me that it wasn't installed, and the apt-get command..  it even told me I had to have universe turned on.  wow that's cool.
04:43	<Pelo>	finalburn,  check the forum for your model  there  is problably a fix
04:43	<root__>	william: no idea, I'm still trying to recover my gui. Irssi FTW. You wouldn't happen to know what packages I need to grab off apt in order to get nvidia drivers working would you?
04:43	<Dasnipa`>	nalioth, he is /noticing people the following -fellacious/#ubuntu- You have new messages, type /s read 1 to view them
04:43	<ep2011>	yay, partitioning successful!!! :D
04:43	<slyfox>	eck: do you know if I can invite people to an event via evolution mail ?
04:43	<vox754>	nalioth, there was a guy fellacious who sent private messages, he left
04:43	<duckie>	how can i install a older kernel in feisty that not in the repos.....
04:43	<finalburn>	alright thanx
04:43	<kingcobra>	eck, any ideas
04:43	<vox754>	ep2011, party
04:44	<root__>	duckie: you can always download it off kernel.org and compile it yourself
04:44	<swedekid>	Pelo: in the preferences my sound cards selected
04:44	<william>	root__: ati 7500 here
04:44	<shigutso>	nobody? :/
04:44	<seamus7>	swedekid: also go through this trouble shooting guide: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
04:44	<eck>	slyfox: I believe so, I just got set up with an exchange account myself (not my choosing, but I digress)  so I have not looked into that yet
04:44	<root__>	william: lol
04:44	<overyonderthere>	Hey all; I'm trying to upgrade to feisty from edgy, download from update manager keeps freezing forever at "fetching file 50 of 55".
04:44	<TashKavarish>	not that i dont like ubuntu but is there such a thing as a distro thats easy to use but not as well, messy
04:44	<cypruser>	I have a serious problem. I cannot download the package information for the Feisty upgrade.
04:44	<fiveiron>	hey so if the update-manager is the preferred way to upgrade to feisty, what is the preferred way for the server edition?
04:44	<eck>	kingcobra: do you have the kernel module loaded?
04:44	<duckie>	that root_
04:44	<root__>	william: then would you know a good way to backup a ton of files to CD's using only the terminal so I can do a clean install
04:44	<TashKavarish>	im asking cuz id like to replace the hdd with an 8gb flash drive for a fanless pc
04:44	<overyonderthere>	problem with the server? been like this for 48 or so hours
04:44	<kingcobra>	eck, yes rt2570
04:45	<overyonderthere>	keeps failing
04:45	<eck>	kingcobra: if the module is loaded the device node should show up
04:45	<ScrAm>	I'm having a problem with installing Ubuntu Edgy; I'm at the prepare mount point part, and I've selected a root file system, /media/sda1, but it still says "No root file system."
04:45	<zeroday>	use the guided partining
04:45	<LordLimecat>	hey, im trying to get fbi (commandline image viewer) to work, and when i use fbi [image name]  it says "/dev/fb0 cannot be found"
04:45	<zeroday>	*partitioning
04:45	<Vaske_Car>	can anybody help me to install this skin? http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Kore+Player?content=56254
04:45	<kingcobra>	eck, not in networking or ifconfig
04:45	<scot524>	fiveiron: why not just change 'edgy' to 'feisty' in sources.list, apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade?
04:46	<overyonderthere>	updater current, tried a bunch of times
04:46	<verma>	is there a way to replace the ntfs driver with ntfs-3g
04:46	<vox754>	overyonderthere, what do you think... everybody is fetching 7.04
04:46	<william>	root__: lol.. no. I backup to a network share. did a feisty upgrade go bad for you?
04:46	<[NGGR] no-sweat>	when was 7.04 released
04:46	<overyonderthere>	problem with my connection?
04:46	<TheDebugger>	Yesterday
04:46	<Hess>	thats a nice skin
04:46	<root__>	william: yea, I was expecting it though
04:46	<[NGGR] no-sweat>	o srsly
04:47	<root__>	william: stupid non-free kernel modules
04:47	<Pelo>	overyonderthere,  severs are overloaded ,  wait a few days
04:47	<brenix>	Vaske: im trying to do the same. I got it working for beryl, but not the original themes
04:47	<[NGGR] no-sweat>	is it much different from 5.10
04:47	<eck>	kingcobra: what about iwconfig
04:47	<vox754>	ScrAm, the root partition must be simply /
04:47	<shigutso>	my mouse is almost-working: scroll ok, but no mouse3 click... in ubuntu 6.06 it worked fine, but not here in 7.04... what's the problem??
04:47	<rellik>	scot524, I did dist-upgrade without a problem on my server
04:47	<root__>	william: I'm using irssi right now because my X is FUBAR
04:47	<hrp2171>	crdlb, thanks.  but im concerned about something.  i had installed a 686 kernel image and that repo is having me redownload  386 image again.  hopefully i can remove the 386 image after installing the newer nvidia binary.
04:47	<Michael>	Hi, quick question: does 7.04 offer direct(er) support for broadcom wireless cards? that was the big factor that kept me from 6.
04:47	<Dasnipa`>	[NGGR] no-sweat, from 5.10? very... it is 3 versions older
04:47	<kingcobra>	eck ill go offline n check, ill be back
04:47	<paradon>	root__: I have an ATi myself, but there's a bunch of messages on the forums suggesting that if you have an nVidia 8800, you need to apt-get "nvidia-glx-new" instead of "nvidia-glx".
04:47	<rellik>	err that was for fiveiron
04:47	<mojo>	Where would I make a feature request like this:  when viewing a table in gnome apps the headers let you put the mouse on the divide and drag the column width.  in windows (yeah that os) there is a nice feature where you can double-click to auto-set the width to the widest element.  would i suggest that to gnome, gtk, or is there another place to make such a request?
04:48	<LordLimecat>	anyone know anything about framebuffers
04:48	<fiveiron>	rellik: thx
04:48	<Whiz2>	i still need help accessing my exim mailbox. (It doesn't come with POP or IMAP access. anyone able to help?
04:48	<crdlb>	hrp2171, I don't think that repo has restricted modules for 686
04:48	<atlantia>	hmm moving along moving along
04:48	<william>	root__: xubuntu feisty upgrade went ok for me.... then through the gnome/ubuntu desktop on there.
04:48	<Pelo>	mojo,  that is already in,  but it might not work in some apps,  the problem being the app not gnome
04:48	<atlantia>	seamus7, ha i had installed network-manager package. Removed, all is acting as intended now
04:48	<hrp2171>	crdlb, yikes!
04:48	<seamus7>	atlantia: great
04:48	<root__>	paradon: thanks for the tip. I have a 7600GO but i'll give it a shot anyway
04:48	<ethilien>	does anyone know if the bittorrent tracker is down?
04:48	<crdlb>	hrp2171, I'll check, I never use it for dapper
04:49	<ethilien>	I can't get a connection
04:49	<malik__>	what are the necessary codecs to be installed to play audio n video files?
04:49	<atlantia>	seamus7, ty for help, on to nvidia latest
04:49	<mojo>	Pelo: oh, so app must support... ugh.  thought it was a widget thing but i am not a coder :(
04:49	<zeroday>	malik: what version are u using
04:49	<atlantia>	!nvidia
04:49	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
04:49	<lmosher>	malik__: Yeah that definately depends on what type of audio/vido :)
04:49	<malik__>	im suing fiesty
04:49	<Pelo>	ethilien,   It's been unreachable to me for most of the day  try enabling dht if you have it
04:49	<zeroday>	atlantia: use envy by milone
04:49	<overyonderthere>	Okie doke
04:49	<root__>	william: I have a ubuntu install but have fallen in love with the speed of fluxbox. My origional plan was to back up everything and install Xubuntu because it is so stripped down lol. The alure of the upgrade now button was too strong though
04:49	<mojo>	malik__: is it a class action suit?
04:49	<ethilien>	ok
04:49	<eck>	mojo: you would file a bug report in gnome bugzilla for gtk
04:49	<paradon>	root__: If you can live without OpenGL, you can always "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and enable either "nv", or if that doesn't work, "vesa".
04:49	<atlantia>	malik__, lol
04:49	<malik__>	ooops sorry i am using fiesty
04:49	<finalburn>	whats funny is my mousepad on the labtop works fine at the login screen? (sorry just had to comment)
04:50	<crdlb>	hrp2171, it looks like it does
04:50	<vox754>	mojo, I think a right click on the border adjust things, try it please
04:50	<Pelo>	ethilien,   pm ?
04:50	<ethilien>	ty Pelo, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't me
04:50	<atlantia>	zeroday, envy doesn't like feisty apparently, i sued it with edgy, but now it says OS not supported
04:50	<root__>	paradon: oh...
04:50	<crdlb>	hrp2171, did it install some version of linux-restricted-modules-686 ?
04:50	<root__>	paradon: i may just do that lol
04:50	<eck>	mojo: although something similar to that is being worked on for google soc
04:50	<dtholden>	work around key ring on start up for wirless?
04:50	<atlantia>	zeroday, considering hacking the script and trying anyways
04:50	<rellik>	fiveiron, in the upgrade notes, there is actually another suggested way to do it.. don't recall the program though
04:50	<paradon>	root__: At least it'd let you use a web browser :-P
04:50	<brenix>	malik: the link you sent was for the xmms player..or are you trying to get the "theme" theme installed?
04:50	<lmosher>	atlantia: yeah envy is not good w/ fiesty for now. I just spend about 3 hours fixing what forcing envy to install on fiesty did to my poor, poor system :)
04:50	<rbrtoclto>	hi all, I have a laptop running feisty I'm booting using vga=794 without the splash screen or quiet options as I like to check the boot up messages, however in feisty the default console font (this is before it changes it to whatever you set in /etc/default/console-setup) is very hard to read
04:50	<zeroday>	atlantia: I think alberto just released a new version not sure tho
04:50	<rbrtoclto>	anyone know how to change it?
04:50	<hrp2171>	crdlb, nope the 386 version only.  though i already had the 686 version of those modules
04:51	<atlantia>	lmosher, lol thanks for the heads up
04:51	<madman91>	can someone help me setup my mouse ? After my upgrade to feisty my scrolly thing wont work... so after following many many many guides on google/ubuntuforums i got it to work a little.. help?
04:51	<seamus7>	dtholden: there used to be something called "Pam" which did that ... but it didn't work for me
04:51	<atlantia>	lmosher, sorry to hear your misfortune
04:51	<crdlb>	hrp2171, but you need the newer version, try a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
04:51	<william>	verma: isn't in feisty ?
04:51	<atlantia>	zeroday, was hoping for that, let me check his site
04:51	<dc>	my usb quit working after putting feisty on my laptop, waht gives?
04:51	<damian>	hey, how do you make the stupid cube appear?
04:51	<malik__>	so what codecs do i need to install to be able to play mp3/divx/avi/mpeg1,2,3,4 media types.? any suggestion is welcome
04:51	<mojo>	Pelo: okay... it is actually working in xchat chan list... cool.  it just doesn't seem to like to work on first try, takes a couple times before it reacts.  weird.
04:52	<damian>	It worked on m ebefore but it's not working now
04:52	<lmosher>	atlantia, If I'd been smarter from the beginning it woulda been easier. I was trying to do it from console, but couldn't remember the names of thigns. Finally I booted x with the 'nv' driver and removed/added the correct nvidia packages. It's basically just a version mismatch
04:52	<zeroday>	does automatix install nvidia drivers?
04:52	<Stoffer>	oops...someone responded to my question about an application that schedules the closing of another.  Could whoever answered please repeat it please?
04:52	<dtholden>	seamus7, its just getting annoying having to put int he key ring password everytime i start up on my wirless..
04:52	<seamus7>	damian: I held down the middle mouse button (the wheel) on mind and the cube activated for me
04:52	<verma>	william, is it/
04:52	<eck>	mojo: this is the project someone isworking on: http://live.gnome.org/MathiasHasselmann/NewLayoutManager
04:52	<damian>	yes zero, but ubuntu does it now
04:52	<dc>	!automatix | zeroday
04:52	<ubotu>	zeroday: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
04:52	<Toma->	zeroday: synaptic installs nvidia drivers just fine
04:52	<atlantia>	lmosher, ah ok.. dealt with that.. cool i am gonna try his latest installer and see what crappens
04:52	<mojo>	eck: thanks for that link!
04:52	<hrp2171>	crdlb, the orange updater icon was already lit, opened it and the option to update the 686 modules was there.  downloading as we chat.
04:52	<_Codeman_>	I'm having a problem with grub: error 21
04:52	<verma>	william, well I did not try doing anything with that driver, just assumed that its the same .. may be I should test
04:53	<lmosher>	atlantia: Did he approve one for fiestly like literally while I was dealing with it? b/c afaik that's the one I just installed
04:53	<malik__>	!codecs
04:53	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
04:53	<seamus7>	dtholden: yes i agree .... if you manually configure your /etc/network/interfaces file you can have it log in automatically but you won't have roaming
04:53	<atlantia>	lmosher, there is a .deb on his site
04:53	<kingcobra>	is there any way to see which module is running which device
04:53	<atlantia>	lmosher, that says "package for feisty"
04:53	<Pelo>	_Codeman_,   #grub
04:53	<_Codeman_>	thanks :D
04:53	<ixian_>	for some reason 3D effects don't work in feisty. they were working right when i installed it but i must've messed something up and now they aren't. i have tried enabling/disabling the 'ATI accelerated graphics driver' and it doesnt make a difference, i still get a 'composite extension not available' error. i have a x850 xtpe. anyone have an idea?
04:53	<damian>	It doesn't work for me th emiddle button to activate the cube :(
04:53	<root__>	william: I haven't the slightest what I did but I think I fixed it lol
04:53	<hrp2171>	crdlb, gonna restart.  thanks for your assistance.
04:53	<damian>	may be i fucked up the xorg?
04:53	<atlantia>	lmosher, running now, i'll guinea pig it for ya at least :)
04:54	<dtholden>	seamus7, yes i have tried configuring it so it won't raom, put in the right wireless details, and yet it doesn't work, it worked fine in edgy, but now this network manager thing is annoying
04:54	<root__>	paradon: sshhhhh lynx is a browser. You'll hurt its text-based feelings
04:54	<vox754>	!language >	damian
04:54	<lmosher>	atlantia: yeah that's what I installed.
04:54	<mojo>	eck: that is cool... though i was really thinking of things like the channel list in xchat, columnar tables with column headers.  but clicking away i found that it does work in xchat, though iirc there are several apps where it doesn't
04:54	<damian>	oops sorry
04:54	<william>	verma: I had it manually installed in Edgy and it is still there now.... do you have the ntfs configuration tool in App >>	Sys Tools ?
04:55	<sizzam>	Feisty doesn't seem to have come with /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.    Can I just create those?
04:55	<ks1>	sizzam: yes
04:55	<Leftmost>	If I'm using Feisty beta, will simply running software update bring me up-to-date with Feisty release?
04:55	<kingcobra>	anybody know is there any way to see which module is running which device
04:55	<seamus7>	dtholden: yeah i tried creating two profiles in Networking (manual configuration) .. one for roaming and one for a static ip ... but it doesn't work as expected ... Network Manager seems to work best only with roaming and then of course you get that password prompty :(
04:55	<ks1>	Leftmost: yes
04:55	<Leftmost>	Excellent, thanks.
04:56	<lmosher>	atlantia: Maybe I did something wrong...dunno. Anyway, for me it threw a version error from 9755 to 963? or something. I had to change to 'nv' driver, use synaptic and installed nvidia-glx-new, REMOVE nvidia-kernel-2.6.20.15... I think that about does it.
04:56	<sizzam>	ks1: do you know the proper file permissions for those files
04:56	<LordLimecat>	Leftmost: enjoy your 354 updates :)
04:56	<dtholden>	seamus7, i just wish it was soo easy like in edgy, where i put in the details, and there it goes, no password needed each time
04:56	<shigutso>	my mouse is almost-working: scroll ok, but no mouse3 click... in ubuntu 6.06 it worked fine, but not here in 7.04... what's the problem??
04:56	<seamus7>	dtholden: have you tried disabling the nm-applet in sessions and then configuring the interfaces file?
04:57	<william>	LordLimecat: It was 970 from Edgy (Xubuntu)
04:57	<dtholden>	seamus7, nope not yet, ill try later, thanks :)

05:01	<witless>	hi.  when i turn on desktop effects my window manager disappears.  it's a system76 laptop with a nvidia GeForce Go 7600.  any recommendations?
05:01	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: this weekend I'm gonna try to plug it into an actual ethernet port though and fix it like that
05:01	<LordLimecat>	stoffer: yes, trolls, hes just spamming because he KNOWS people will respond
05:01	<HasratUSA>	Hell Konversation has ignore features too lol
05:01	<Leftmost>	Lots of press for Ubuntu.
05:01	<tom_>	witless: do you mean your window borders dissapear
05:02	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, isn't it wireless?
05:02	<witless>	tom_ yes
05:02	<Pelo>	Leftmost,  paper press or just the digg stuff ?
05:02	<LordLimecat>	its classic bully behavior...stop payin attention, and they stop bullying....worst case, at least youve stopped caring :)
05:02	<flubber>	does anybody know any good mp3 editors where like you delete part of the song to like 30 seconds?
05:02	<atlantia>	was talking to a guy about envy, cant remember his nick.. "hey guy, it works"
05:02	<Stoffer>	LordLimecat, ah, attention whore, gotcha.  I was just playin' with him anyway
05:02	<Leftmost>	Pelo, probably mostly the latter.
05:02	<tom_>	witless: i had that problem before, i'll link you up the fix
05:02	<Toma->	flubber: audacity
05:02	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: yes, but when I'm online (with an ethernet cable) my friend's gonna try to fix it via vnc :)
05:02	<prcrash>	Audacity
05:02	<artabrahao>	what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386?
05:02	<flubber>	thanks

05:03	<prcrash>	wohoo!
05:03	<prekitt_>	does anyone know how to do a local network install feisty
05:03	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: either that or we'll just make a fing password for it, it'll probably work with just a password hehe, but I'll find out this weekend, thanks for the help too :)
05:03	<prekitt_>	?
05:03	<tom_>	witless: just follow the instructions on this site: http://nlindblad.org/2007/01/28/no-window-borders-with-beryl-and-nvidia-aiglx/

05:03	<pppoe_dude>	s
05:03	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, did you try wifi-radar?
05:03	<jack|ass>	so "Authentication error" when trying to upgrade using upgrade manager is just because of the heavy load, right?

05:03	<Leftmost>	By the by, I'm trying to install uswsusp. It fails on configure, saying it can't find a swap partition. I don't have a swap partition, but I do have a swap file which shows up in /proc and is in /etc/fstab. Why might this happen?
05:03	<kingcobra>	anybody know is there any way to see which module is running which device
05:03	<LordLimecat>	know what would be killer?  if next time a windows spamming griefer entered, we just nmapped him into oblivion o.0
05:03	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: no, haven't heard of it yet..?
05:03	<tom_>	witless: np :)
05:04	<PanzerMKZ>	is screen the only way to do that?
05:04	<pppoe_dude>	!info wifi-radar | Abom

05:04	<Vessquire>	I think I got the guided partitioner to goof on the feisty install by saying I wanted one disk to be guided w/ LVM and then going back and saying I wanted the other disk guided w/ LVM... it got to 60% and just froze
05:04	<ks1>	!info screen

05:04	<pppoe_dude>	try it out, Abom
05:04	<Rug>	PanzerMKZ: there are other ways, but screen is the easiest.  you could also look into rsh
05:04	<Stoffer>	if Archive Manager is telling me that a rar is unsupported, it's an issue with the rar right?
05:04	<prcrash>	I just wish there was a worthwhile driver for laptop ati cards... it's the only thing missing for me right now
05:04	<ks1>	!info fortune
05:04	<ubotu>	Package fortune does not exist in feisty
05:04	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: do I need the internet to install it or can I download it on the ubuntu site?
05:04	<eck>	Stoffer: you need to install the unrar package
05:04	<rttm>	anyone getting the cpu throttle to work on p5b deluxe mb
05:04	<Pelo>	shigutso, ,   you might need to do a little editing of xorg.conf, check the forum for your specific problem you'll probably find a fix
05:04	<tom_>	Stoffer: rar isn't supported i dont think, its a prop. format
05:05	<JacktheHomeless>	I cannot get my nvidia video card drivers working in Feisty. Anyone know how I can get it working?
05:05	<Toma->	Bout time.
05:05	<PanzerMKZ>	there has to be a away to run a process in the background without seeing the info on said process
05:05	<pppoe_dude>	Abom, you can download it from packages.ubuntu.com, then sudo dpkg -i <package name>
05:05	<stellaras>	hi there
05:05	<Pelo>	Hobbsee,  better late then never

05:05	<Stoffer>	eck, tom_ ok thanks
05:05	<PanzerMKZ>	screen can't be the only thing out there

05:05	<Dr_willis>	JacktheHomeless,  depends on how you are trying and what the problem is. mine worked fine.
05:05	<LordLimecat>	how do i get the up-to-date one from repos?
05:05	<shigutso>	Pelo, what do you think i have to change in xorg.conf ? any guess?
05:05	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: awesome thanks a bunch, I'll try it now ;)
05:05	<stellaras>	is there anyway to run 7.04 from a usb ?

05:05	<Hobbsee>	Pelo: true.  i was afk
05:05	<stellaras>	is there anyway to run 7.04 from a usb pen drive 1gb ?
05:05	<Pelo>	shigutso,  not realy,  check the forum
05:05	<shigutso>	Pelo, ok.. thx :/
05:06	<PanzerMKZ>	Rug: I am running folding at home. It updates every hour or so with some text
05:06	<scot524>	prekitt: There is an example here (http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_pxe_install_server). it's for edgy, but should be able to adapt to feisty fairly easily
05:06	<Toma->	stellaras: you could dd the iso to a pen drive...i think
05:06	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: looks like it's only for edgy: edgy (net): graphical utility for managing Wi-Fi profiles [universe] 
05:06	<Abom>	1.9.7-0ubuntu2: all
05:06	<eck>	stellaras: no need to dd, just install grub and copy the files over
05:06	<PanzerMKZ>	Rug: I just want to start the folding and let it run without showing anything
05:06	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: will that work fine with feisty?
05:06	<Rug>	PanzerMKZ: are you trying to do this on a dedicated host that doesn't allow persistant processes?
05:06	<Cactii>	stellarus: If your bios supports booting from USB just copy the iso filesystem to the USB drive.
05:06	<artabrahao>	what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386? To a server whatis better and more stable, 6.06 ot 7.04?
05:06	<JacktheHomeless>	Dr_willis: I tried just reconfiguring the xorg using sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and any time i choose the nvidia setting the xserver wont start. right now im running using vesa
05:06	<Rug>	PanzerMKZ: I see

05:07	<stellaras>	<eck>	sorry if what i ask is stupid but....grub ?
05:07	<Toma->	eck: standard install = 2gb :<
05:07	<PanzerMKZ>	Rug: no I don't think so. it is dapper
05:07	<kingcobra>	hello
05:07	<ethilien>	artabraha, 6.06 has long term support
05:07	<rttm>	"CPU frequency scaling unsupported" p5b deluxe ?
05:07	<eck>	stellaras: then you would configure grub to run the live cd kernel/initrd
05:07	<ethilien>	7.04 is the latest release
05:07	<Vessquire>	Does the guided partitioning hang for anyone else on install?
05:07	<Vessquire>	I can't get past it
05:07	<ethilien>	it will be replaced eventually
05:07	<eck>	Toma-: no, this would be copying the contents of the iso, not installing it
05:07	<Vessquire>	always hangs at 60%
05:07	<stellaras>	eck: what is grub ? sorry i'm new to linux
05:07	<Toma->	eck: ahhh good call.
05:07	<eck>	stellaras: it is the bootloader ubuntu uses
05:07	<artabrahao>	what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386?
05:07	<Dr_willis>	JacktheHomeless,  all i did. was install the nvidia-glx package. and change 'nv' to 'nvidia' in the xorg.conf and restarted X. i diddien use that dpkg-reconfogure command.
05:07	<rttm>	Vessquire not so much as hanging just very slow
05:07	<artabrahao>	<ethilien>	what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386?
05:07	<eric>	Hi. any laptop owner's around?  Cause, I'm trying to figure out how to control the brightness. The Fn button on my samsung isnt responding :/
05:08	<ethilien>	artabraho, it was replaced by 7.04
05:08	<aburton>	wonderful- we're on the topic of grub
05:08	<Vessquire>	rttm, how slow?
05:08	<ethilien>	those are the current releases
05:08	<kingcobra>	eck, rausb0 is not in either ifconfig or iwconfig
05:08	<Pelo>	Vessquire,  try partitionnying manualy before starting the install,   you can run gparted from the system >	admin menu in the live cd desktop
05:08	<JacktheHomeless>	Dr_willis:  i didnt grab the nvidia-glx package. I did an upgrade from a copy of edgy that had the drivers already installed correctly.
05:08	<rttm>	about 2 to 3 min somethimes Vessquire
05:08	<eck>	kingcobra: check dmesg to see if the kernel is telling you anything useful
05:08	<Vessquire>	Pelo, I'm installing the server version... not livecd
05:08	<dood_>	is there a way to disable the screensaver from terminal?
05:08	<Flannel>	PanzerMKZ: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FoldingAtHome  that explains how to set it up as a daemon
05:08	<artabrahao>	<ethilien>	what means the long term support?
05:08	<Dr_willis>	JacktheHomeless,  ive not done a 'upgrade' so no idea what over probpems may be causing that.
05:08	<stellaras>	eck: is there any web site that explain how to do this?
05:08	<aburton>	grub hangs on "starting up..." whenever I try to load into windows xp. My menu.lst can be found here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16711/
05:09	<Vessquire>	rttm, mine must not be just slow then.... its been sitting unmoved with no disk activity for 5 mins
05:09	<LordBrain>	Is there a way to get a separate user x-session going without closing the current one?
05:09	<LordBrain>	i'm using xubuntu
05:09	<Pelo>	Vessquire,   I don't know how to help with that then   except that you can probably launch "parted" before the install and try that way
05:09	<JacktheHomeless>	Dr_willis:  no sweat man, however, i am gonna try getting that package. worst comes to worst, ill just do a clean install of feisty and start fresh
05:09	<ethilien>	artabrahao: its supported for 10 years or so
05:09	<LordBrain>	and I would rather not install gnome
05:09	<ethilien>	let me check
05:09	<eck>	stellaras: I wrote one a while ago, not sure if this is 100% up to date but it should be pretty close: http://eklitzke.org/howto/livehdd.xhtml
05:09	<ceil420>	where can i get Gibbon?
05:09	<ceil420>	!gutsy
05:09	<ubotu>	Gutsy Gibbon is the code name for the next release of Ubuntu (7.10). See https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2007-April/000276.html and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyReleaseSchedule
05:09	<Flannel>	ceil420: nowhere yet
05:09	<stellaras>	thnx
05:09	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  the 'start' menu may have a login-new user - thing. kde has it. gnome has it.. not sure about xfces stuff
05:09	<PanzerMKZ>	thanks
05:09	<bitmess>	 When I run beryl-manager it says this    Checking for XComposite extension               : failed
05:09	<rttm>	i think its a bug because for me p5b deluxe mb i thought it was hanging but it work after
05:09	<ethilien>	artabrahao: excuse me, 3 years for desktop and 5 years for server
05:09	<Flannel>	aburton: change "root" to "rootnoverify" (line 154 in that paste)
05:10	<artabrahao>	<ethilien>	who will give that support? Is the 6.04 the same as 6.10?
05:10	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  or you could spawn one with the proper 'sudo startx -- SOMTHING' command
05:10	<Stoffer>	eck, are you familiar with using unrar?  Do I just have to "unrar" the file that ends in .rar or do the entire series (r00, r01, etc)?  So far I did just the one and it only gave me a new folder...
05:10	<LordLimecat>	i have a few graphics driver/framebuffer questions, anyone have a moment?
05:10	<Hubris>	Having a problem with login through VNC....can anyone offer some suggestions?
05:10	<stellaras>	eck: i tried http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/01/25/usb-x-ubuntu-610 but when i was at the final step to move the files to the usb the files size was to large
=== funfun is now known as funfun_
05:10	<aburton>	Flannel: Thanks!
05:10	<ethilien>	artabrahao: no, 6.10 is more up to date
05:10	<eck>	Stoffer: iirc you do something like: unrar e foo.rar
=== acorn22 is now known as acorn22`sleep
05:10	<rttm>	Stupid question i'm running gaim is there a better app for irc
05:10	<LordLimecat>	rttm: i hear xchat is better
05:10	<HasratUSA>	rttm Konversation
05:10	<dood_>	let me be a bit more clear. Is there a way to disable the Gnome screensaver from terminal?
05:10	<Flannel>	rttm: xchat-gnome is in main, xchat is in universe
05:11	<rttm>	thanks guys
05:11	<kingcobra>	hello
05:11	<mojojojo_>	hello
05:11	<Vessquire>	I use colloquy on mac... not sure if its available on linux, but I love it
05:11	<eck>	stellaras: how large did you make the partition?
05:11	<kingcobra>	eck, dont think so
05:11	<artabrahao>	<ethilien>	to a webserver what is the recommendation, 6.04 or 7.04? What means no support for 7.04?
05:11	<Stoffer>	eck, yeah, I think in unrar-free the flag is -x though?  It says everything extracted fine, but I get nothing out of it
05:11	<ferret_0568>	Does anybody know if, with the NVIDIA module, a Dell 2005FPW will work just fine?
05:11	<_Codeman_>	No one is answering me on #grub :(
05:11	<LordBrain>	Dr_willis: I do not know if this is it, but there is System ->	Login Window, but it seems to require me to know the current users password.
05:11	<eck>	stellaras: also, i would recommend grub over syslinux, grub can boot fat filesystems (like syslinux) but is more standard and imho easier to use
05:11	<ferret_0568>	My laptop seems to always think a VGA monitor is connected
05:11	<HasratUSA>	Vessquire do you think it's possible to use MAC OS X's default internet browser in Ubuntu?
05:11	<Hubris>	ferret - it works fine on my 2405fwp
05:12	<stellaras>	eck:i followed the tutorial step by step so i did the partition +700MB
05:12	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  not using xfce, so i dont know its layout/menus. it may be wanting the sudo password to spawn the new x session
05:12	<stellaras>	eck: ate least i thnk so :)
05:12	<Vessquire>	HasratUSA, you mean safari?
05:12	<HasratUSA>	Vessquire: yes!
05:12	<Vessquire>	I have no clue
05:12	<unixforge>	hi, i have a problem. I downloaded the ubuntu 7.04 iso ( not alter. ). And after ai boot the live cd. Is asking me for an user/pass. So the Q: What is the user and the pass?
05:12	<HasratUSA>	sheet
05:12	<ethilien>	artabrahao: go to pm
05:13	<dood_>	the problem is that every time the screensaver kicks in, X restarts. Annoying considering I am in the middle of a feisty upgrade
05:13	<LordBrain>	Dr_willis: you know a commandline way to do it?
05:13	<kingcobra_>	eck, dont think so
05:13	<eck>	stellaras: maybe you need to make it a little bit bigger? you can't be off by much
05:13	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  or you could spawn one with the proper 'sudo startx -- SOMTHING' command
05:13	<artabrahao>	<ethilien>	pm?
05:13	<HasratUSA>	unixforge: that's NEVER supposed to happen
05:13	<ferret_0568>	If I don't use the 'Option          "UseDisplayDevice" "DFP-0"' in my xorg.conf, I don't get anything on my laptop's internal LCD
05:13	<eck>	kingcobra_: the kernel should at least have a line saying it loaded up the module right?
05:13	<ethilien>	artabrahao: a private chat
05:13	<eck>	Stoffer: it is e or x (i think no -)
05:14	<eck>	Stoffer: the difference is where it extracts the files to
05:14	<aburton>	Flannel: That didn't work
05:14	<ethilien>	artabrahao: you should see it in your irc client somewhere
05:14	<unixforge>	HasratUSA: in vmware works fine. But when i try to do a normal install... Is asking me for user pass// very odd
05:14	<ferret_0568>	After that, the NVIDIA control panel always says that "CRT-0" is disabled
05:14	<ethilien>	artabrahao: it depends on what client you're using
05:14	<stellaras>	eck: so what i have to try is when the tutorials says +700MB i will write something like +800MB  ?
05:14	<Flannel>	unixforge: ubuntu is the user, there is no password.  But, that shouldn't happen.  Is this ubuntu? or fluxbuntu? or what?
05:14	<eck>	stellaras: correct
05:14	<Stoffer>	eck, well I tried e and it gave me the same thing.  I'm not putting in an extract-to path, but it should just default to the current directory, no?
05:14	<Linux_>	question. I have vnc server installed on my ubuntu machine. I can't remeber the password for it. Does vnc store the password somewhere or can I reset the password?
05:14	<ferret_0568>	You could set a user account with no password
05:14	<carutsu>	is the channel ubuntu+1 gone?!
05:14	<ferret_0568>	Yes
05:14	<stellaras>	eck: thank you i will try again :)
05:15	<stellaras>	c u soon
05:15	<ferret_0568>	Feisty got released
05:15	<stellaras>	7.04 ROCKS
05:15	<Flannel>	carutsu: feisty was released.  this is feisty support
05:15	<ferret_0568>	It was stable for a long time
05:15	<unixforge>	Flannel: I tried ubuntu/ubuntu, ubuntu/ , root/root . Nothing works... :(
05:15	<Hubris>	Linux_ - you can reset the password
05:15	<carutsu>	Flannel thx
05:15	<ferret_0568>	You could set a user account with no password
05:15	<eck>	Stoffer: what about: unrar l foo.rar
05:15	<ferret_0568>	read "man passwd"
05:15	<kingcobra_>	eck, cant find it
05:15	<Linux_>	how could you reset the password?
05:15	<eck>	Stoffer: can you see the files in the rar?
05:15	<break_>	AHH
05:15	<kingcobra_>	eck its there in lsmod
05:15	<Flannel>	unixforge: what flavor of ubunu is it?
05:15	<ethilien>	artabrahao: are you still there?
05:15	<_Codeman_>	I keep getting grub: error 21 and I can't figure out how to fix it
05:15	<Linux_>	Hubris, how would I reset the password
05:15	<artabrahao>	<ethilien>	im pm too
05:16	<eck>	kingcobra_: i am not sure what the problem could be, I don't have a ralink chipset. Have you tried the forums?
05:16	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  'startx -- :1 '  should do it. if you login as the user under the console first. i think
05:16	<unixforge>	Flannel: ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
05:16	<ferret_0568>	artabrahao: login to the affected user, and type "passwd"
05:16	<Stoffer>	eck, yes
05:16	<kingcobra_>	eck, no ill try that thanks
05:16	<PMantis>	is the ubuntu torrent tracker down?
05:17	<eck>	PMantis: it was earlier today
05:17	<ferret_0568>	How do I set up dual monitors in Ubuntu?
05:17	<PMantis>	eck, I can't connect to it right now. Can you or anyone else verify (could by my firewall)
05:17	<unixforge>	Flannel: i used this mirror http://ftp.iasi.roedu.net/mirrors/ubuntulinux.org/releases/feisty/ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
05:17	<artabrahao>	<ferret_0568>	I think I did it
05:17	<p47>	how can I know hich version of ubuntu is running in my pc ?
05:18	<Stoffer>	eck, I think for some reason it keeps giving me a directory instead of the file itself...
05:18	<Flannel>	p47: lsb_release -a
05:18	<rever>	Hi does anyone know is there is a binary for the latest Democracy player in Feisty?
=== william is now known as wil_syd
05:18	<ethilien>	PMantis: I can't connect to the tracker either
05:18	<PMantis>	ugh
05:18	<aburton>	Does anyone have a clue as to why grub isn't letting me boot into XP? It hangs on "starting up..." Here's my menu.lst http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16712/
05:18	<p47>	Flannel: ok thank's
=== Hubris is now known as Hubris2
05:18	<ferret_0568>	Can I hotplug displays on my laptop?
05:18	<dtholden>	open xorg command?
05:19	<jason_>	just updated to the 7.04 and now my screen resolution is stuck on 800x600
05:19	<ferret_0568>	I want to know if it's safe, since the NVIDIA control panel has a button for detecting hot-plugged displays
05:19	<PMantis>	ethilien, thanks for checking
05:19	<Stoffer>	eck, so now I have 2 directories names just like the file, one within the other, but not the actual file...
05:19	<ethilien>	PMantis: np
05:19	<Pelo>	dtholden,  do you mean   gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
05:19	<ferret_0568>	The monitor is VGA, the laptop has a VGA connector, no adaptor
05:19	<ferret_0568>	Is it safe?
=== wil_syd is now known as will_syd
05:19	<_Codeman_>	I keep getting grub: error 21 and I can't figure out how to fix it
05:20	<Hubris2>	jason - you can reconfigure your Xserver, it will detect the hardware, and let you select the resolutions you want
05:20	<jason_>	how i do that
05:20	<sdfasdfawef>	ferret: works for me
05:20	<artabrahao>	ethilien where are you?
05:20	<kalifonria909>	-if you have too many bootable partitions will that cause ubuntu not to boot
05:20	<SeveredCross>	Anyone know if it's possible to link channels in alsamixer?
05:20	<Stoffer>	eck, you don't suppose that the non-free version would be any better than unrar-free do you?
05:20	<eck>	Stoffer: and nothing within the directories?
05:20	<Stoffer>	eck, nothing
05:20	<ethilien>	artabrahao: I'm still here
05:20	<TashKavarish>	I'm using a 1920x1200 lcd via dvi, it used to work, I had to send it in for repairs, I put a 1440x900 replacement which worked fine, when I got the 1920 back it works but max res dropped to 1600x1200 what gives? and how do i get 1920 back
05:20	<ethilien>	artabrahao: I was waiting for you in the private chat
05:20	<ferret_0568>	yes, kalifonria909
05:20	<eck>	Stoffer: I just have the non-free one, and I haven't had any problems with it
05:20	<Pelo>	aburton,   is your windows installed on the same hdd as ubuntu ?
05:20	<SeveredCross>	I'd like to link my LFE with master volume so that when I push the media buttons to lower the master volume, the LFE lowers too.
05:20	<Hubris2>	jason - sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
05:20	<ethilien>	artabrahao: but I'll just say it here
05:21	<p47>	does festy has a problem with beryl ?
05:21	<larson9999>	i don't know how you guys can see at those resolutions.  i must be getting old
05:21	<ethilien>	artabrahao: the only real difference is how long you intend to operate the server and how much you would mind upgrading between major releases
05:21	<larson9999>	big monitors?
05:21	<ethilien>	artabrahao: if you want the least hassle, go with 6.06
05:21	<Pelo>	larson9999,  glasses
05:21	<eck>	larson9999: turning on subpixel rendering (if you have an lcd)helps
05:21	<Meshezabeel>	p47, beryl has problems right now period, it is still only in testing stage
=== will_syd is now known as wil_syd
05:21	<ethilien>	artabrahao: but if you want more recent software, go with 7.04
05:21	<larson9999>	Pelo, got glasse.
05:21	<p47>	Meshezabeel: so, what should I do ?
05:22	<Pelo>	larson9999,  try bi-focals
05:22	<Hubris2>	TashKavarish: you can either manually edit the Xorg.conf file with  your resolutions....or reconfigure your Xserver, after which it will let you select resolutions
05:22	<Meshezabeel>	p47, about what, missed what you wanted to do
05:22	<rever>	p47, I am running beryl on feisty without issue
05:22	<aburton>	Pelo: Yeah
05:22	<amicrawler>	my auto paste  stop working any body know why ?
05:22	<Stoffer>	eck, well I just installed the non-free, and it displayed all of the r's (r00, r01) as being extracted, and it asked to overwrite what I had, but it just gave me another directory....
05:23	<rever>	p47, I use trevinos git script and compile the git version
05:23	<Pelo>	aburton,  then I donT' rightly know,  try asking in #grub
05:23	<HasratUSA>	p47 what's your problem with beryl?
05:23	<TashKavarish>	Hubris2: ive tried both, the res is in xorg.conf but it wont use it
05:23	<eck>	Stoffer: the file isn't hidden, is it?
05:23	<Stoffer>	eck, the file should be an avi, btw
05:23	<p47>	Meshezabeel: I updated to festy but now I have problems with beryl, beryl shows me the windows in color white !
05:23	<rever>	p47, however, Beryl and Compiz is merging so not much new going on lately
05:23	<Stoffer>	eck, ls -A?
05:23	<Meshezabeel>	artabrahao: I disagree, I'd go with 7.04
05:23	<eck>	ls -a
05:23	<eck>	err, i guess -A is fine too
05:23	<unixforge>	can someone explain why the ubuntu live cd is not working ? is it a bug? or what? Is it posible to bypass  the live cd login ?
05:24	<chipbuddy>	sorry if this is a often repeated question. i'm trying to get avi files to play. can i just go through snyaptic? or is it more involved than that
05:24	<epotash>	has feisty changed the way it handles ipods, mine doesnt auto mount with an ipod icon when i plug it in anymore?
05:24	<squitijax>	I just downloaded the x86-desktop torrent, and it gives me a GNOME settings daemon error on boot
05:24	<artabrahao>	ethilien nice, and I still trying go to pm
05:24	<TashKavarish>	right now its like the nvidia driver is blocking the use of anything higher then 1600x1200
05:24	<Meshezabeel>	p47, not sure why, can you change it in the Theme Manager?
05:24	<eck>	unixforge: what is the issue you are having?
05:24	<Stoffer>	eck, no, they must have been empty because I removed both with no issues
05:24	<p47>	Meshezabeel: I had beryl running in my last version but when I did a update I got the windows color white !
05:24	<dj-fu>	p47: the white window issue is due to insufficient graphics memory on nvidia cards
05:24	<TashKavarish>	but only on dvi, svga is fine
05:24	<Pelo>	unixforge,  username ubuntu  pswd blanck I think
05:24	<unixforge>	I downloaded the ubuntu 7.04 iso ( not alter. ). And after ai boot the live cd. Is asking me for an user/pass. So the Q: What is the user and the pass?
05:24	<ethilien>	artabrahao: can you not find the tab?
05:24	<larson9999>	i'll give that subpixel thing a try although i really think it's my eyes :)

05:25	<lomez>	juan, thank you
05:25	<dj-fu>	the white window issue IS caused by insufficient graphics memory in the tfp gl extension on nvidia cards/drivers.
05:25	<jlowell>	anyone running 7.04 on an hp laptop?
05:25	<Juan>	what's a *nix equivalent to razorlame?
05:25	<jlowell>	or a laptop with broadcom wireless?
05:25	<dj-fu>	It doesn't know what to do when you run out of graphics memory so just textures white
05:25	<Flannel>	Juan: what does razorlame do?
05:25	<bkuebler>	/exit
05:25	<Jordan_U>	sinisterguy, System ->	Preferences ->	Keyboard shortcuts
05:25	<Pelo>	Juan,  try this  http://www.linuxrsp.ru/win-lin-soft/table-eng.html
05:25	<p47>	rever: yes I have nvidia, but the cube is very slow and I can't see the up bars of the windows I mean the title bars
05:25	<eck>	Stoffer: have you tried to see if the archive manager can open rars now?
05:26	<Antioch>	How can I make it so that when I hold down the mouse-wheel and move the mouse up or down the page scrolls up or down?
05:26	<HasratUSA>	Due to curiosity I just launched Beryl in my feisty. now let me see if it acts weird. for strange reasons i have always been able to fix composite relatead issues
05:26	<rbrtoclto>	is there any way to get the notification tooltips for network settings, updates, etc. to automatically close after a while?
05:26	<Hubris2>	jlowell - having troubles getting Broadcom wireless to work?
05:26	<eck>	(i'm not sure, i've only used cli unrar)
05:26	<Juan>	Flannel, it's a gui to lame
05:26	<rever>	you copy instead of copy-to-pixmap
05:26	<unixforge>	Pelo: so the pass is blank OR blanck?
05:26	<eck>	unixforge: what if you switch to VT1?
05:26	<jlowell>	Hubris2: indeed

05:26	<Stoffer>	eck, i think it's working now that I deleted those two directories... it's taking much longer to extract
05:26	<bonee>	where can i get w32codecs
05:26	<eck>	unixforge: iirc there is a root shell there
05:26	<Stoffer>	eck, yeah, it worked :) thanks
05:26	<Pelo>	unixforge,   I mean no password
05:26	<Jimbo99>	does anyone recall where the icon for the ubuntu menu is located in feisty fawn amd64?
05:26	<sinisterguy>	Jordan_U: it complains about it being unuseable to typ with that key or something, which is wierd, because it worked fine in edgy
05:26	<rever>	p47, nvidia has a bug in there driver
05:26	<squitijax>	I just downloaded the x86-desktop torrent, and it gives me a GNOME settings daemon error on boot
05:26	<ethilien>	bonee: try the universe repository
05:26	<jason_>	i dont know what oam doing in the xserver
05:26	<eck>	Stoffer: weird. well, i'm glad it works :-)
05:26	<Jordan_U>	Juan, all media apps on Linux use LAME for encoding mp3 AFIK
05:27	<HasratUSA>	sinisterguy there could have been nicer, easier ways of doing so if and only if your desktop effects AKA compiz had GUI configuration managers such as that of Beryl
05:27	<unixforge>	Pelo: I tried with no pass. Not working :(
05:27	<p47>	rever: so what sould I do ?
05:27	<artabrahao>	ethilien the tab that is appearing is the on that I clicked in you nick and the one that I start a chat
05:27	<Juan>	i know, but say i wanna batch downsample some mp3 files
05:27	<ethilien>	artabrahao: oh well
05:27	<wil_syd>	!w32codecs

05:28	<_Codeman_>	I keep getting grub: error 21 and I can't figure out how to fix it, can anyone assist?
05:28	<lomez>	and it wont let me change it back for some reason
05:28	<Pelo>	Za----,  welcome to the madhouse
05:28	<lomez>	any idea?
05:28	<rever>	p47, you will have to play with the Beryl Advance options. Force Aiglx and try copy instead of texture from cvopy
05:28	<klicker>	Will the normal desktop run properly on a 500 Mhz PC with 512MB of memory?
05:28	<Jordan_U>	lomez, In what way won't it let you? Does it give an error?
05:28	<Pelo>	unixforge,  it might be different in this version but I've never needed a password to boot the live cd
05:28	<ethilien>	klicker: most probably
05:28	<rever>	p47, YOu may have some performance hit however. What type of card and how much memory
05:28	<lomez>	No, when I double click it just reverts back to trying to open it with terminal
05:28	<LordLimecat>	hey, if i want nvidia drivers, is it "better" to just install them with the restricted driver manager, or using nvidias script (version 9755)
05:29	<LordLimecat>	which is newer?
05:29	<jason_>	i cant get me screen back to right size
05:29	<Jordan_U>	LordLimecat, Restricted manager, no doubt
05:29	<HasratUSA>	p47 you got a nvidia card?
05:29	<Jimbo99>	the restricted versions aren't as up to date as the nvidia versions.
05:29	<p47>	 mg and 1g od memory ram !
05:29	<delire>	LordLimecat: try the click and go restricted driver manager first.
05:29	<p47>	ha no no no
05:29	<Jordan_U>	LordLimecat, The script may give you something "newer" but I would argue likely not "better"
05:29	<eck>	LordLimecat: it's not an issue of which one is newer, it's an issue of which one is compatible with X11
05:29	<artabrahao>	ethilien yes, but I Think the 7. is better, but the 6 is more secure, but I think I'll use this version for an year, is the 6 the better choice? How connect to a pm?
05:30	<p47>	HasratUSA: rever I have 1g of ram and 256mg of nvidia
05:30	<kalifonria909>	anyone ever install ubuntu under a raid setup
05:30	<preaction_>	i've got a problem with the installer/live CD: it seems to hang when i double-click the "Install" icon, access the CD for a few minutes, and then stop (do nothing)
05:30	<jlowell>	Jimbo99: is there something about broadcom in that article?
05:30	<eck>	LordLimecat: there isn't really any guarantee that the latest drivers that nvidia ship will be compatible with the version of X shipped in ubuntu
05:30	<HasratUSA>	p47 choose 'Force nVIDIA'
05:30	<ethilien>	artabrahao: if you only want it for a year, 7.04 will be around long enough
05:30	<delire>	preaction_: low RAM? try the Alternate CD
05:30	<rever>	p47, look through this site. Great resource for nvidia and Linux .... http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/forumdisplay.php?s=4115ef45d87ddbb282ab7c66456e83ff&f=14
05:30	<Jimbo99>	about unsupported wireless chipsets
05:30	<klicker>	ethilien:  Better to use the version with the lite desktop (not Gnome)
05:31	<Jordan_U>	preaction_, What happens if you run "sudo ubiquity" from a terminal ?
05:31	<HasratUSA>	p47 advanced beryl options >	rendering platform >	force nVIDIA
05:31	<squitijax>	preaction_: did you use bittorrent to download?
05:31	<Vessquire>	does anyone know if you partition swap space still when you use lvm?
05:31	<TokenBad>	ok the error I get when trying to make the drive ext3 after making free space on a ext3 drive  is check file system on /dev/hda1 for errors and fix if possible...any help with this?
05:31	<ethilien>	klicker: it might load faster
05:31	<preaction_>	delire: 1gb ram, i think my burn might be bad so i'm probably going to try the alternate cd anyway
05:31	<preaction_>	squitijax: yes
05:31	<`davo>	anyone got a list of supported video drivers for 7.04?
05:31	<ethilien>	klicker: do you mean the xfce version?
05:31	<preaction_>	Jordan_U: i can't get a terminal, it does the same thing. even opening menus takes a minute or two
05:31	<ethilien>	klicker: but in general it will work fine
05:31	<klicker>	ethilien:  yes
05:31	<eck>	TokenBad: that is not an error, that is just a status message
05:31	<ethilien>	it only requires 256 mb ram
05:32	<TokenBad>	eck that is what it stops with
05:32	<redsmurf>	a question...has anyone tried to upgrade from edgy to fiesty w/ many 3rd party repos in your sources.list (and packages installed from them)?
05:32	<artabrahao>	ethilien what is the real difference  betwee this 2 versions?
05:32	<ethilien>	klicker: the gnome version I mean
05:32	<Jordan_U>	`davo, Do you mean supported cards?
05:32	<bird603568>	ZOMG HOWE DO I RUN TEH LOONIX?????????
05:32	<klicker>	ethilien:  okay.  Thanks much.  Trying to interest a very intelligent 11 year old who loves to dig into things and learn.
05:32	<HasratUSA>	davo nvidia driver version 1.0.9755 works great so far
05:32	<`davo>	yes
05:32	<eck>	TokenBad: maybe it completed successfully?
05:32	<`davo>	sure
05:32	<Hubris2>	I have vnc4server configured.  When I do a test and connect to :1, I get a gnome login prompt....but when I enter ID/pass, it just returns to the login.  Before I upgraded to Feisty it would login normally.  Ideas?
05:32	<squitijax>	I keep getting a 'couldn't start GNOME Settings Daemon' error
05:32	<bird603568>	i cant run slackware so i was told to run ubuntnut
05:32	<ethilien>	klicker: your welcome
05:32	<TokenBad>	eck, no...it has a red minus thing next to it..saying it didn't complete
05:32	<eck>	TokenBad: run e2fsck from a terminal
05:32	<bird603568>	i run  the renamed firefox because im l44t
05:33	<eck>	!ops

05:33	<kurtti>	There were some posts on slashdot that feisty should not be installed on a laptop yet, what do you think?
05:33	<HasratUSA>	kurtti you got the link?
05:33	<Hobbsee>	eck: ?
05:33	<Jimbo99>	jlowell:  If you're running Ubuntu on a laptop and your Wi-Fi card is not detected or supported, try installing the Ndisgtk package (listed as such in Synaptic, but as 'Wireless Windows Drivers' in Add/Remove Applications). Then select the new System, Administration, Windows Wireless Drivers entry in Ubuntu's menu bar. The ensuing dialog box asks for the location of an INF file that represents the Windows driver for your wireless adapt
05:33	<Hobbsee>	moron
05:33	<Valinski>	Can anyone tell me how to find out what kernel in on so i can match the header package for the Nvidia driver?
05:33	<TokenBad>	eck is there some recomended options I should use?
05:33	<bird603568>	LAWLZ
05:34	<TashKavarish>	speaking of laptops, if i want to get one for installing ubuntu on, how do i pick one with parts thatll work
05:34	<nibsa1242_>	Valinski type uname -r in a terminal

05:34	<Valinski>	Thanks nibsa
05:34	<Antioch>	Basically all centrino based laptops work
05:34	<Hobbsee>	hehe
05:34	<nibsa1242_>	np
05:34	<squitijax>	how do I prevent the install/liveCD from going into X?
05:34	<TashKavarish>	core2 ones too ?
05:34	<yell0w>	TashKavarish, no broadcom
05:34	<Jordan_U>	Valinski, I would suggest trying the official Ubuntu drivers first though
05:34	<redsmurf>	ANYONE: have you tried to upgrade from edgy to fiesty w/ many 3rd party repos in your sources.list (and packages installed from them)?
05:35	<Antioch>	I have core2duo in this laptop, IBM T60 -- its working ;)
05:35	<eck>	TokenBad: I think -y to fix them, but if you run it without options it will at least report errors
05:35	<Jordan_U>	yell0w, Trying to get a broadcom card working?
05:35	<TashKavarish>	broadcom? thats the nic right ?
05:35	<Pelo>	squitijax, not sure you can,  but there is an alternate install cd,  it is text based
05:35	<nibsa1242_>	which broadcom card?
05:35	<TokenBad>	eck it just comes up asking for options if I don't give it any
05:35	<yell0w>	Jordan_U, already did, took a while though, hassels
05:35	<Cisyouc>	I disagree.
05:35	<Za---->	Q: if I update my Ubuntu Distribution from 6.10 to 7.4 will I lose any data?
05:35	<Cisyouc>	I have a BCM4306 and I've never had any troubles in Linux.
05:35	<eck>	TokenBad: try -y then
05:35	<Adross>	i accidently deleted /usr/share/pixmaps, how can i restore it?
05:35	<Valinski>	Ive tried everything! Im getting desperate. My Xorg files seem to be different when i look them up in terminal to when i look on the preview in the nvidia software
05:35	<HasratUSA>	hey pelo what's up
05:35	<DShepherd>	squitijax, press f6 remove splash and quiet. Then and single.. got that?
05:36	<Cisyouc>	Either bcm43xx or ndiswrapper have been very easy and smooth setups.
05:36	<eck>	TokenBad: (of course you also need to specify a device)
05:36	<Dr_willis>	I think the live cd may have some 'cheatcodes' you can give it at the boot/grub prompt to make it not start X. but not sure what you COULD do with it from just the console.
05:36	<squitijax>	DShepherd: thanks
05:36	<Pelo>	Za----,  no,  but back it up anyway in case something goes wrong,  and wait a few days for the upgrade the servers are overwhelemed
05:36	<Pelo>	hello HasratUSA
05:36	<DShepherd>	squitijax, np
05:36	<nibsa1242_>	I have two computers with BCM4318 rev 2, its been a hassle but its possible
05:36	<Za---->	Pelo Ok thank you I'm still new to Linux

05:36	<Adross>	anyone?
05:36	<yell0w>	nibsa1242_, compaq ?
05:36	<yell0w>	hehe
05:37	<Za---->	Pelo but the longer I have it the more I love it
05:37	<Cisyouc>	It really depends on the BCM card, I guess.
05:37	<Pelo>	Za----,  so are a log ot ppl
05:37	<Jordan_U>	nibsa1242_, In Feisty it should be much better using bcm43xx
05:37	<Pelo>	a lot of ppl
05:37	<HasratUSA>	Pelo so i hope that you finally finished downloading the required packages and upgrading to Feisty Fawn last night, right?
05:37	<Za---->	=^_^=
05:37	<Cisyouc>	I've been using Linux on this machine for a few years now, and I've never had a problem.
05:37	<TokenBad>	whats the pastebin url?
05:37	<rellik>	since the upgrade, my sound has been acting weird..  I have a playlist in amarok, and when it goes to the next song, it will play it (those dancing bars that show levels work), but there may or may not be any sound.  if a song starts, and is silent, the next song may or may not play.  or, if I restart the current song, it may or may not play..  any ideas what's going on here?
05:37	<Jordan_U>	!pate >	TokenBad
05:37	<nibsa1242_>	yellow, no a Gateway and an Acer... the Acer is the serious problem the Gateway wasn't too bad until I had a hd crash and kinda forgot how to use the wireless

05:38	<TokenBad>	thanks Jordan_U
05:38	<squitijax>	As I'm using the torrent and vmware, what could be the possible sources of problems?
05:38	<Jordan_U>	!raid >	kalifonria909
05:38	<nibsa1242_>	Jordan_U thanks, its good to know it'll be easier my major problem always seemed to be where to put the firmware

05:39	<TokenBad>	eck, got that when ran command
05:39	<Jordan_U>	nibsa1242_, In Feisty just install bcm43xxfwcutter and it will automatically download and extract it to /lib/firmware for you :)
05:39	<linuxfool>	night? now is day
05:39	<kalifonria909>	jordan thanks but thats for someone who has an os installed

05:39	<eck>	err /dev/hda1
05:39	<nibsa1242_>	Anyhow I'll find out how it goes after I finish updating my desktop to Fiesty, but since that crashed in the middle I need to finish dling the live cd so I can chroot and fix it.
05:39	<vimalg2>	Is there anyone here who has experience in setting up EPIA motherboards+VIA processors on Ubuntu?
05:39	<Jordan_U>	!install >	kalifonria909
05:39	<nibsa1242_>	Thanks so much for the info Jordan_U
05:40	<HasratUSA>	uh oh okay pelo. just letting you know i stopped caring about the damn slow speed and went to bed and at around 6 am in the morning discovered that the upgrader cleaned up all previous junks and restarted the system to present before me a nice bug-free feisty fawn 7.04 with an useless compiz but more stable beryl, updated versions of several applications and faster responsiveness. i haven't tried feisty's other features yet :-D
05:40	<[_miT_] >	Happy 420 ubuntu ppl
05:40	<nixternal>	lol
05:40	<jshreffl>	Is there a way to automatically select the best package mirrors in Ubuntu?
05:41	<nibsa1242_>	hahaha

05:41	<TokenBad>	eck, /dev/hda1: clean, 11/746304 files, 59150/1492029 blocks
05:41	<[_miT_] >	Is it true that there is no 64bit support for flash in ubuntu?
05:41	<[_miT_] >	tokenbad!
05:41	<redsmurf>	maybe i should go the forums, one last time...to anyone: have you tried to upgrade from edgy to fiesty w/ many 3rd party repos in your sources.list (and packages installed from them)?  How did it go?

05:41	<eck>	TokenBad: then you are good
05:41	<TokenBad>	then why will it error out?
05:41	<Pelo>	HasratUSA,   there realy isn't any reason to wait around on the servers or for the upgrades to finish downloading anyway,  you just strt it and go take a walk or smthing
05:41	<eck>	jshreffl: it is netselect or apt-select or something like that

05:41	<Jordan_U>	[_miT_] , There is no 64 bit flash support for any OS, you can get it to work though without too much hastle
05:41	<HasratUSA>	kurrti and you're saying laptops users can't disable hald-addon-storage to make 7.04 usable in their laptops?
05:41	<LordLimecat>	hey, if i want nvidia drivers, is it "better" to just install them with the restricted driver manager, or using nvidias script (version 9755)
05:42	<Angel-SL>	*cry*
05:42	<LordLimecat>	which is newer?
05:42	<Admiral_Chicago>	LordLimecat: I'd use restricted-manager
05:42	<eck>	jshreffl: i guess netselect-apt
05:42	<HasratUSA>	yeah pelo the less you care and worry the merrier :P
05:42	<redsmurf>	hobbsee: thanks, was more hoping for experience reports as I know its somewhat of a crapshoot
05:42	<LordLimecat>	Admiral_Chicago, any specific reason?
05:43	<HasratUSA>	and kurtii the bug is unconfirmed also
05:43	<nixternal>	Admiral_Chicago: restricted manager?
05:43	<Cisyouc>	I have a question..
05:43	<Admiral_Chicago>	LordLimecat: I trust our methods more
05:43	<vimalg2>	Is there anyone here who has experience in setting up EPIA motherboards+VIA processors on Ubuntu?
05:43	<Jordan_U>	LordLimecat, More likely to work, more supported, won't break when you upgrade...
05:43	<Pelo>	HasratUSA,  yesterday I was mostly here just to have a good laugh at the mayhem
05:43	<kurtti>	ok, so no need to worry..?
05:43	<Admiral_Chicago>	nixternal: sure
05:43	<HasratUSA>	and kurtii here is the work-around go read https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/84603
05:43	<HasratUSA>	damn yesterday was crazy
05:43	<LordLimecat>	Jordan_U, does that mean when kernel upgrade happens, i wont need to reinstall nvidia?
05:43	<[_miT_] >	Hobbsee: sudo aptitude install gnash ?
05:43	<Jordan_U>	LordLimecat, Yup
05:44	<Admiral_Chicago>	nixternal: i mean... I think thats what the command is to launch it
05:44	<Hobbsee>	redsmurf: that depends what exactly youv'e installed.
05:44	<Hobbsee>	[_miT_] : whatever that page says.   most likely
05:44	<LordLimecat>	Jordan_U, alright....thanks, Jordan_U & Admiral_Chicago
05:44	<Cisyouc>	I'm currently using 7.04 running Gnome + compiz, but I can't get the "move to viewport" buttons to come up in the right click menu from the title bar of windows. Any idea?
05:44	<Jimbo99>	hey, i have an unusual question.  After installing feisty on an old  laptop I was able to boot into the desktop and use it without much problem.  So, I then decided to load the restricted drivers for the nvidia video chipset that's built into that notebook.  After installing it and rebooting when the computer starts up the built in lcd of the laptop goes black.  If i plug in an external monitor, then reboot i can get to the desktop and
05:44	<artabrahao>	thanks

05:46	<Pelo>	Jimbo99,  I can't help but I think Ive heard this before,  I am sure there is someting in the forum ,  you card not detect the external screen but not the built in one or something
05:46	<Em3raldMcSquizzy>	Hobbsee: hehe, well that's kinda what I expected ... nice to see it all calm.
05:46	<cotton>	I get this when trying to upgrade: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16720/

05:49	<TokenBad>	what is up with this crap...it will not install to the drive...even with the thing saying its ext3
05:49	<Jordan_U>	binMonkey, Yup, and so did dapper and Edgy :)
05:50	<[_miT_] >	Jordan_U: how do i get it to work?
05:50	<Jordan_U>	binMonkey, On Feisty they are much improved though, and easier to use
05:50	<binMonkey>	i couldn't get it working in edgy.
05:50	<Jordan_U>	[_miT_] , sudo apt-get install bcm43xxfwcutter
05:50	<binMonkey>	had to use ndiswrapper.
05:50	<binMonkey>	aaagghhkkkkk!!
05:50	<Angel-SL>	hey, how come ubuntu-server doesn't come with make and gcc?
05:50	<rellik>	since the upgrade, my sound has been acting weird..  I have a playlist in amarok, and when it goes to the next song, it will play it (those dancing bars that show levels work), but there may or may not be any sound.  if a song starts, and is silent, the next song may or may not play.  or, if I restart the current song, it may or may not play..  any ideas what's going on here?
05:50	<Jimbo99>	Pelo:  the thing is that prior to installing the nvidia drivers the built in screen IS detected.
05:51	<KalleDK>	Hey is there a way to make a custom login text when i login via ssh ??? (server)
05:51	<questioning>	mplayer-plugin in firefox was not working as a "normal" user. I tried to run it as root and it works in that situation.. anyone know why that would be ?
05:51	<binMonkey>	fwcutter killed me!
05:51	<Jordan_U>	binMonkey, sudo apt-get install bcm43xxfwcutter
05:51	<eck>	Angel-SL: that is sometimes considered a security risk
05:51	<KalleDK>	using openssh
05:51	<TokenBad>	this is starting to make me mad...I am about try the dapper cd just to see if can fix the drives
05:51	<jared_>	Feisty Fawn is out right?

05:51	<Pelo>	Jimbo99,   solution seems obvious, remove nvidia

Im trying to use gparted to create some new partitons, but it says i need to create a diskable.  i say yes and leave it at default (msdos) and when its done, it doesnt seem to do anything. if i try to create new partitions after it asks me again to make a new disk label. any help?

05:53	<jared_>	err that release didn't help. Feisty Fawn is 7.04 right? (just making sure)

05:53	<jeffwheeler>	What is the best way to disable the _expand() function in /etc/bash_completion, which expands ~/ to /home/username in bash?
05:53	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   then you proceed and add the new partitons
05:53	<redsmurf>	hobbsee: here are the extra repos I have installed software from http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16722/ have any guess what my mileage w/ upgrading may be?
05:54	<eck>	jeffwheeler: iirc it is actually a readline setting
05:54	<Jimbo99>	Pelo, it isn't my main box.  I am just using it to become more familiar with ubuntu on laptops with wireless (which works now)...  I have a nice desktop set up with feisty amd64
05:54	<Cisyouc>	SanoRJ: If you run "glxinfo | grep direct", what do you see?
05:54	<edrews>	Ever seen a dmesg error like this?... hub 1-0:1.0: Cannot enable port 2.  Maybe the USB cable is bad?
05:54	<megafauna>	Hi VLC can't ff or rw my .flv files. can someone recommend an alternitive?
05:54	<Polygon89>	Pelo, that is the problem. When i try to right click >	new, it says i need to create the disk label again. even though i just told it to create it.
05:54	<binMonkey>	this is my first time on irc.  it's pretty cool.  is there a command line app for irc?
05:54	<Hobbsee>	redsmurf: *snort* - you've got two releases there.  try it, anyway
05:54	<Hobbsee>	binMonkey: irssi
05:54	<Jordan_U>	[_miT_] , sudo modprobe bcm43xx ( or just restart )
05:54	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   leave gparted, go back in , try again
05:54	<jeffwheeler>	eck: line 273 in the mentioned file
05:54	<SanoRJ>	Cisyouc:  direct rendering yes
05:54	<eck>	jeffwheeler: yeah it is, the option is expand-tilde
05:54	<Cisyouc>	SanoRJ: Are you running  KDE or Gnome?
05:54	<SanoRJ>	Cisyouc:  gnome
05:55	<edrews>	do most people here run xchat?

05:55	<boyko>	Dammit, I'm frustrated with Feisty.  Feisty is too good.  Too easy.  I don't get any challenge or sense of accomplishment from it.  I haven't had to go to the command line once! 90 minutes and everything works.  What kind of deal is that?  I didn't even need Automatix.  :(
05:55	<binMonkey>	i'm using chatzilla.
05:55	<jeffwheeler>	eck: k, let me look
05:55	<Cisyouc>	I'm using X-Chat, yeah.
05:55	<wehttamb>	can i open Microsoft office 2007 files in openoffice
05:55	<kurtti>	chatzilla.
05:55	<redsmurf>	hobbsee: thx, i know that I have a few dapper repos in there, but i guess ill give it a go
05:56	<Jordan_U>	wehttamb, I believe so
05:56	<Leftmost>	When compiling a custom kernel, how do I create the initrd?
05:56	<DShepherd>	boyko, maybe slackware is what you want to get your hands into then..
05:56	<kurtti>	wehttamb, you can. but not the other way i think.
05:56	<Polygon89>	pelo, that did not work. I tried running it from the terminal and seeing what it says, and every time i try to make gparted create a disklable, it says in the terminal "Unable to open /dev/sda - unrecognised disk label."
05:56	<wil_syd>	!automatrix >	wil_syd
05:57	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   this is a usb hdd ?
05:57	<eck>	Leftmost: if you are doing a custom kernel you might just want to compile everything in
05:57	<Polygon89>	pelo: yes. the partition table got completely wiped out (dont ask me how) and im trying to recreate the partitons
05:57	<eck>	Leftmost: but the command is update-initramfs
05:57	<wehttamb>	so i can open but not save?
05:57	<cotton>	Is anyone going to help me
05:57	<cotton>	I get this when trying to upgrade: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16720/
05:57	<Pelo>	Polygon89,  got a cd with the harware,  see if you have a recovery prog on it
05:57	<Linux_>	whats the command to reinstall via apt-get in ubuntu?
05:58	<kurtti>	no, you can open and save. but you can not open the openoffice documents in ms office
05:58	<Jordan_U>	Polygon89, You may be able to recover them rather than just re-create them
05:58	<Dr_willis>	cotton,  may want to summarize the error a bit.
05:58	<cables>	Linux_, aptitude reinstall?
05:58	<wehttamb>	ok thats all i need
05:58	<eck>	cotton: it means the apt mirror that you are using, which is not an official ubuntu mirror, is borked
05:58	<Jordan_U>	Linux_, sudo apt-get install <packagename>
05:58	<Linux_>	cables I want to do it via apt-get reinstall
05:58	<cotton>	eck: How can I fix it
05:58	<Polygon89>	Jordan_U, it is a 500 gb backup drive. i dont have another drive with nearly as much space as that one, and why should i recover backups if all of the drives that the backups came from are still fine?
05:58	<cables>	Linux_, apt-get and aptitude are pretty much the same
05:58	<edrews>	what is the difference between apt-get and aptitude?
05:58	<eck>	cotton: there's nothing you can do short of notifying the admin of the mirror
05:59	<Polygon89>	Pelo, are you saying that i should see if i have a recovery cd that came with my usb hdd?
05:59	<cables>	edrews, Aptitude handles dependencies a bit better
05:59	<kurtti>	aptitude works better
05:59	<kalifonria909>	why does raid such a pain
05:59	<[_miT_] >	Jordan_U: still doesnt work after reboot
05:59	<edrews>	so why do people still use apt-get??
05:59	<mefistofeles1>	can somebody help me to look for a RPG compiler on linux?
05:59	<jared_>	can anyone tell me what the main differences between Feisty and Dapper is?
05:59	<sartan>	does the ubuntu live cd include a mechanism for wpa & wireless on an intel ipw2200 chipset on the latest version of ubuntu yet?  If I can't find out on IRC, what resources are available to be online to find it it does?
05:59	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   more or less,   recovery format  maintenence,  stuff in general
05:59	<madman91>	can someone help me setup my mouse ? After my upgrade to feisty my scrolly thing wont work... so after following many many many guides on google/ubuntuforums i got it to work a little.. help?
05:59	<megafauna>	where can i get a torrent for feisty pls?
05:59	<Jordan_U>	Polygon89, If it is fine it is fine, I just wanted to tell you that your partitions are likely recoverable before you wrote over them.
05:59	<mefistofeles1>	can somebody help me to look for a RPG compiler on linux?
05:59	<kurtti>	edrews, spread the word ;)
05:59	<cables>	jared_, Feisty automatically installs drivers and codecs, as well as having newer versions of software.
05:59	<edrews>	Dapper is a year older than Feisty...

06:00	<jared_>	Thanks :) I just ordered me some feisty CDs to try it out
06:00	<eck>	megafauna: it is supposed to be torrent.ubuntu.com, but i think it is down right now
06:00	<cables>	jared_, Feisty also has cool graphical effects that Dapper doesn't have. The installer can also import settings from existing Windows installs, but if you're already using Dapper, i guess you won't need that.
06:00	<Polygon89>	Jordan_U, yeah i know they were recoverable (using a program called PhotoRec (i think)), problem is it took forver (eta was 300 hours) so i just said "screw it... its just backups anyway. not anything important".
06:00	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   basicaly if this were 10 years ago with an internal hdd I would tell you to low format it , but that 's not an option anymore so I don't know what to tell you
06:00	<Meshezabeel>	tried upgrading from CD, but gave problems when running internet updates, such as: "Failed to fetch http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/Release.gpg Could not connect to ca.archive.ubuntu.com:80 (206.167.141.10). - connect (111 Connection refused)" do I need to change all edgy to feisty in sources.list before I upgrade from CD?
06:01	<mefistofeles1>	i came here because in google I din't find anything
06:01	<sartan>	Wow ~ Very chatty channel =)
06:01	<rttm_>	ok how do i get rid of the "has left/has joined" i tried /SET irc_conf_mode 1 but i doesn't work dah?
06:01	<koaL>	Hi guys, whats the bash command to restart the entire pc?
06:01	<megafauna>	eck: yes, that is my prob. i'll just wait to upgrade then:(((
06:01	<sartan>	Jordan_U: 'restart'
06:01	<edrews>	koaL: sudo reboot
06:01	<eck>	rttm_: what client?
06:01	<cables>	rttm_, in xchat you can do it by right-clicking on the tab, but you use xchat-gnome
06:01	<rttm_>	xchat
06:01	<koaL>	ok ty, i was upgrading from 6.10 ->	7.4? and my bars went blank
06:01	<binMonkey>	leave

06:02	<Jordan_U>	sartan, Was that really to me?
06:02	<Polygon89>	Pelo, i am going to see if my dads mac can format this drive for fat32, see if it that can re-create the disk label.
06:02	<sartan>	no. I completely messed up. =) Sorry pal
06:02	<rttm_>	sorry xchat-gnome
06:02	<Ringo>	what protocol for asking a upgrade question ?

06:02	<KalleDK>	Is there a way to make a custom logintext when you connect via ssh (would like a console logo when I connect to my server)
06:02	<Pelo>	mefistofeles1,   the servers are a bit overwhelmed at the moment , everyone and their goldfish is upgrading to fiesty, that might cause some problems
06:02	<cables>	wehttamb, i don't know, but you shouldn't use gaim for IRC, it's really horrible.
06:02	<sartan>	KalleDK: how about  /etc/motd
06:03	<koaL>	what ports need to be routed to ensure apache to work, 80 & 8080 ?

06:03	<Pelo>	Polygon89,  best of luck
06:03	<cables>	rttm_, I'm on Xchat at the moment, but I'm installing xchat-gnome to see how to do it
06:03	<wehttamb>	what should i be using?
06:03	<sartan>	good luck =) It's just a standard text file, it might not exist or it might be blank
06:03	<variant>	KalleDK: 80
06:03	<nibsa1242_>	anyone know where the md5sums are for Fiesty?
06:03	<koaL>	just 80, ok thank :)
06:03	<variant>	KalleDK: any  other and clients will have to speciy the port
06:03	<cables>	wehttamb, xchat is probably the best... I'll look at how to do it in Gaim though, if you want
06:03	<Polygon89>	pelo, do you know off hand if there is a way to run gparted in debugging mode? i want to report this as a bug

06:08	<Yggdrasil>	i have to turn off acpd or else, when i close the lid on my laptop and open it again x crashes
06:09	<sartan>	Linux_: depending on the vnc package installed for ubuntu, the vnc password will be in ~/.vnc/passwd as a hash and will not be the same password as a user password
06:09	<eck>	cotton: no, the mirror is broken, there is nothing you can do
06:09	<nibsa1242_>	cables I'll just let the cd check itself I guess
06:09	<acidtabs>	Hi im just wondering how to install sauerbraten i unziped the folder and i see the file sauerbraten_unix but how do u set it up? its on my desktop
06:09	<Pelo>	TOMM_,  probably
06:09	<cables>	nibsa1242_, yeah, if you trust your source.
06:09	<Illnor>	What is the easiest way to transfer a folder or file (80mb) from ubuntu to xp (dual boot environment) ? I have the partitions mounted I want to put them on, but I don't have permission to write

06:09	<eck>	Illnor: if the windows computer has the file sharing option turned on you can access it in gnome by going to places >	network
06:10	<eck>	Illnor: it would only be ubuntu ->	windows though
06:10	<sartan>	Illnor: ~ I heard there's safe NTFS write in fiesty fawn - are you running that or the one before?
06:10	<Tommy>	Maybe i should be a little more specific, the tty job control error.

06:11	<paradon>	cotton: Of course, if you have any particularly wierd stuff installed from them, then potentially something could break on upgrade.
06:11	<sartan>	koaL: in your httpd.conf you need to uncomment out or allow the relevant entries
06:11	<jrjazzman>	bzaks: are you running beryl or compiz?  I think you have to set your keys in them if you use them.
06:11	<sartan>	or enable mod_userdir
06:11	<bzaks>	neither
06:11	<cotton>	ok, what is the comment key? is it #?

06:13	<GluE>	how would i go about learning more about remote controlling my ubuntu box from my windows box
06:13	<beef>	acidtabs, you will need to compile from source by sounds of it
06:13	<bzaks>	GluE: look into SSH or VNC
06:13	<bzaks>	I like VNC: it's like windows remote desktop
06:13	<beef>	apt-get install gcc and read the documentation in the folder you have
06:13	<acidtabs>	im not sure how to do it if i have to do it
06:13	<cotton>	How do I edit /etc/apt/sources.list with the save permission? gedit /etc/apt/sources.list?
06:13	<neilthereildeil>	beef: does it have anything to do with the fact that whenver i wanna connect to a wireless network, i need to startx and use the utility  in the gnome taskbar and enter the network name?
06:13	<ep2011>	I need some help with wireless. It is a Rt61 chipset, which is supported, but I can only get it to work using the command line, not any program... Ive tried wifi-radar, wicd and network-manager. Any help please?

06:14	<cotton>	thanks
06:14	<acidtabs>	it has other files in it as well
06:14	<Tom47>	cotton you have to prepend sudo to the command

06:17	<TECH_1>	Ubuntu Rocks
06:17	<levander>	I just read the Ars Technica story about Feisty being released, and Compbiz being in there by default.  I thought they left Compbiz outta Feisty because of stability issues?

06:18	<nu->	Jordan_U: any ideas?
06:18	<edrews>	it really mac-ifies your desktop
06:18	<lazaruslupine>	madwifi is under restriced drivers
06:18	<lazaruslupine>	so yes i think
06:18	<chowmeined>	bonee: also.. unreal tournament runs on linux, doom3, quake4,
06:18	<Jordan_U>	radioaktivstorm, nu-, maybe #kubuntu
06:18	<cables>	BarronVon, they do, but 6.10 is now outdated
06:18	<maccam94>	levander: they did leave it out, but in the system->preferences->desktop effects you can enable it

06:18	<Gat0rvean>	When I boot from my Ubuntu CD, and choose the 1st option (live cd / install) It goes through, loads the modules, and when what I can only assume is the login or Desktop environment loading screen comes up, it freezes, playes a musical piece/weird noise, and freezes, like a choppy Window with a Ubuntu logo in the top right, and stays
06:18	<radioaktivstorm>	alright
06:18	<jrjazzman>	which laptops work best with ubuntu (besides system76)?
06:18	<levander>	Jordan_U: "Ubuntu 7.04 also includes built-in support for compositing and 3D desktop effects via Compiz in the default installation." from http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070420-ubuntu-7-04-feisty-officially-released.html

06:19	<levander>	maccam94: is it unstable still?

06:19	<Moosejaw>	hey all...so is the solution to get wpa to work installing wicd???
06:19	<cotton>	Whats the default mirror for upgrading?
06:19	<deebus>	anyone know how I can get picassa to work?
06:19	<levander>	deebus: Did you try the GNOME app f-spot and not like it?
06:19	<bonee>	chowmeined: i want games like final fansty

06:19	<deebus>	yeah

06:19	<MrMakeveli>	Jordan_U, thanks i'll check it out
06:20	<cotton>	Should I comment out all the lines in my resp that isn't defualt
06:20	<levander>	deebus: I've never tried installing Picasa, good luck.
06:20	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, are you on Feisty?
06:20	<cotton>	paradon: USA
06:20	<Tommy>	Little help:         /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off
06:20	<maccam94>	levander: it is, which is why it's not enabled by default. it is now an option in the GUI now, however, so people who want it can easily get it. it's not unusably unstable, but it isn't stable either
06:20	<Stoffer>	In scheduling a task to kill Azureus w/ the gnome-scheduler, what would the command be?  Kill azurues wouldn't work, would it?

06:20	<Stoffer>	oh right
06:20	<jason_>	how do i get into xserver
06:20	<deebus>	levander:  any ideas?

06:20	<paradon>	cotton: although anything with "archive.ubuntu.com" could be considered "default".
06:20	<levander>	maccam94: One more question.  Compiz is a window manager right?  It sounds like from the UI, they're calling it just effects...  Is it a window manager?
06:21	<jason_>	how i do that
06:21	<cotton>	paradon: Should I comment out the automatix resp?
06:21	<Stoffer>	and any idea why gnome-scheduler keeps saying that I don't have a crontab (besides that I probably don't have a crontab), and/or how to fix it?
06:21	<mojo>	maccam94: it replaces the metacity window manager component between gnome desktop and x.org server
06:21	<neilthereildeil>	can someone please help me with wireless?
06:21	<levander>	Stoffer: 'pidof azureus' or 'pgrep azureus' would give the pid
06:21	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: what card?
06:21	<maccam94>	levander: it's a window manager, but it integrates closely with the gnome gconf
06:21	<yagami>	maccam94: so what about the session- what i am specifically looking for is an ini file that i can delete- or do i have to save the present session as an empty session?
06:21	<paradon>	cotton: I would get rid of automatix, yes.
06:21	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, It is much easier in Festy and the ops aren't accepting my update to ubotu ( the message is outdated ) just install ntfs-config
06:21	<crossed>	SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEX?????????????????????????????????????????????????????''''
06:21	<levander>	maccam94: it doesn't sound wierd to you they are calling it effects in the UI?
06:21	<cotton>	paradon: get rid of it, or just comment out the resp
06:21	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: linksys wpc54g
06:22	<edrews>	Compiz is just a desktop, not a window manager, right?
06:22	<Stoffer>	levander, yeah, but it changes each time I start it right?  Not useful for a recurring task
06:22	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: i have everything working
06:22	<paradon>	cotton: Just comment it out, same effect.
06:22	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: What's the issue?
06:22	<cotton>	ok, thanks alot
06:22	<neilthereildeil>	im speaking from my laptop

06:22	<darwin>	how can I change the default keyboard layout?
06:22	<levander>	Stoffer: so, make this your command to kill it: kill `pgrep azureus`
06:22	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: do you know the ESSID of the network?
06:22	<Doctor_Nick>	Jordon_U: does libntfs9 conflict with libntfs-3cg?
06:22	<edrews>	mojo, what does Compiz replace in Gnome?
06:22	<mojo>	edrews: metacity
06:22	<levander>	Stoffer: check "pgrep azureus" on the command line to make sure it works
06:22	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, Nope
06:22	<Gat0rvean>	Anyone? help?
06:22	<lazaruslupine>	you could try ifconfig <interface>	up

06:23	<yagami>	*i've*
06:23	<maccam94>	levander: they're calling it effects because to most people that's all it'll look like. it uses the same themes as metacity, etc

06:23	<maccam94>	yagami: ah, kk
06:23	<neilthereildeil>	but the problem is that sometmes the network i need to connect to is the college one and other times it the home one
06:23	<Tom47>	deebus have you followed the instructons at http://picasa.google.com/linux/thanks-deb.html
06:23	<BarronVon>	generally when you install a new cardbus wifi card (trendnet atheros based) on 6.10 do you need to do anything like compile a driver or anything?

06:25	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: Is it encrypted?
06:25	<levander>	Stoffer: I'm not sure of the differences between running your killall and the command I suggested, generally they both do the same thing.  Just play on the command line and check a few man pages...
06:25	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: but i also have to startx and tell the program in the taskbar the name of the wireless network
06:25	<cotton>	Does ubuntu get viruses, if so does it come with a scanner? Also, can I see whats'
06:25	<neilthereildeil>	yea
06:25	<maccam94>	Gat0rvean: i had a similar issue in 6.10 with my 8800
06:25	<cotton>	new in 7.04
06:25	<r0bby_>	any of you have any idea?
06:25	<neilthereildeil>	i can connect
06:25	<Stoffer>	levander, it must be named something else
06:25	<ober0ne>	I've been trying to find out how to upgrade my 6.06 release of kubuntu (nobody in that channel makes sense!) to 6.10
06:25	<maccam94>	cotton: no it doesn't get viruses
06:25	<neilthereildeil>	i have the key and the correct parameters
06:25	<ober0ne>	the commands on the site don't seem to work
06:25	<wil_syd>	Illnor: sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
06:25	<levander>	Stoffer: what's named something else?
06:25	<maccam94>	cotton: if you want i can explain in a PM
06:25	<mojo>	r0bby_: i have ideas from time to time but they usually get me in trouble
06:25	<Gat0rvean>	Maccam, and booting up in safe mode worked?
06:25	<DShepherd>	cotton, as far as i know ... no
06:25	<Jordan_U>	!viruses | cotton
06:25	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about viruses - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
06:25	<jbroome>	cotton: no, there are some in the repos if you need to scan stuff ofr your windows firends
06:25	<BarronVon>	can anyone help me get my atheros based cardbus adapter to work under 6.10?
06:25	<edrews>	mojo: Well, I know Compiz is much cooler to play around with than Metacity. I hope it replaces it soon.
06:25	<Hobbsee>	!upgrade | ober0ne
06:25	<mojo>	robert_: j/k ... actually i missed your question

06:25	<KalleDK>	Thx sartan motd was just what I was looking for :)
06:25	<main>	i had major problem with my p5b deluxe until last 7.04 release
06:25	<cotton>	maccam94: I can't pm
06:25	<ober0ne>	*sigh* I've been there
06:26	<Gat0rvean>	I've tried the newly downloaded 7.04 CD I have, and the 6.10 CD i used on my test box, both CD's are good to go
06:26	<ober0ne>	the commands aren't working
06:26	<maccam94>	cotton: eh, i'll just make a channel
06:26	<Jordan_U>	cotton, No, it does not, you can get scanners for windows viruses though so you don't spread them to friends
06:26	<levander>	Stoffer: you're sure it's running?
06:26	<r0bby_>	'm not talking about those ideas, i'm talking about trying to get webcams to work
06:26	<lazaruslupine>	i think to kill azureus you just kill java
06:26	<maccam94>	cotton: join #maccamcotton
06:26	<r0bby_>	I'm using feisty
06:26	<lazaruslupine>	look at the output of top
06:26	<Stoffer>	levander, yeah...I'm looking right at it
06:26	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: I'm not sure I understand the problem, I guess.
06:26	<ober0ne>	I don't believe I have an update managaer
06:26	<lazaruslupine>	see any process named java or anything?
06:26	<Moosejaw>	anyone know a working site that has wicd on it?
06:26	<Stoffer>	levander, though it's not doing anything...
06:26	<lazaruslupine>	if you're running azureus
06:26	<Stoffer>	levander, it's been giving me problems all night
06:27	<madman91>	WHERe do i set dma to on .. what file ?
06:27	<main>	could not  get ubuntu to do anything.. so i try pclinuxos and it work..  something about the jbmicro chip set
06:27	<mojo>	edrews: you can replace it yourself right now if you want :)  originally there was a project, luminosity, i think, that was a modified metacity to support composite.  but then dave (methinks) started from scratch on compiz and iirc it uses glitz libraries for the gl stuff, tho i am not authoritive on this stuff
06:27	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: everytime i wanna connect to a network, i use iwconfig and connect. but then, i have to startx and go to the taskbar and rightclick on the wireless network icon and tell it the name of the network im connected to

06:28	<mojo>	grego22: hmm... list out the first 5 and we'll take it from there?  lol
06:28	<grego22>	and gnome-settings-daemon its fucked =;

06:28	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: If you don't connect using iwconfig and let the taskbar applet connect, does that work?
06:28	<grego22>	sorry Hobbsee
06:28	<dimas__>	is someone able to tell me whats new on ubuntu 7.03?
06:28	<grego22>	and i cannot open gnome-terminal
06:29	<grego22>	i cannot open synaptic (im using all manually)
06:29	<Jordan_U>	harry, They should be if you used the official beryl-project repos
06:29	<grego22>	the update-manager cant update itself
06:29	<grego22>	ive upgrade it using... apt-get update
06:29	<Tom47>	grego did you check the cd for errors?
06:29	<mojo>	dimas__: it has a spiffy new version number, a clever name, um...  actually there's a page on it i think...
06:29	<grego22>	but the gnome-settings-daemon its BROKEN
06:29	<Hobbsee>	Jordan_U: they're not official, tehy're third party
06:29	<ober0ne>	how does one get an update manager?
06:29	<grego22>	Tom47,  ive checked

06:29	<kbidd>	I appoligize in advance, since this is problaby considered "offtopic", but i was wondering if anyone knew of any good music authoring tool for ubuntu capable of writing sheet music as well as midi playback.
06:30	<grego22>	im considering to reinstall 6.10
06:30	<main>	grego22 it worked with other version right
06:30	<lazaruslupine>	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
06:30	<Jordan_U>	grego22, That is likely to break things ( going to Feisty by changing Edgy to Fiesty in sorces.list is *not* supported )
06:30	<Hobbsee>	kbidd: maybe try #ubuntu-offtopic, if you dotn get an answer here
06:30	<grego22>	the only advantage i have seen is the fast boot
06:30	<dimas__>	i did updated but looks the same to me
06:30	<Professa91>	does anyone know where i can get a webcam driver for my dell xps m1210
06:30	<grego22>	Jordan_U,  ive burned an cd
06:30	<grego22>	and installed over it
06:30	<Professa91>	for ubuntu
06:30	<grego22>	formatting 6,10 partition
06:30	<mojo>	kbidd: on the tip of my brain is rosegarden, but i'd have to google it to be sure it's even close to right for you
06:30	<ep2011>	I need help setting up my wireless in the command line at startup
06:30	<lazaruslupine>	its not about looks the differences are mainly internal
06:30	<Hobbsee>	Jordan_U uh?  it is, but it wont actually fix any broken deps
06:30	<kurtti>	you should not use apt-get
06:31	<kurtti>	use aptitude instead
06:31	<grego22>	can anybody help me to fix my gnome-settings-daemon
06:31	<lazaruslupine>	for upgrading yeah
06:31	<grego22>	i cannot change theme
06:31	<mojo>	Jordan_U: apt-get dist-upgrade?
06:31	<Hobbsee>	kurtti: either work, apt-get is clearer
06:31	<kbidd>	mojo, i'll check it out... dont worry about googling it... thanks :P
06:31	<grego22>	i cannot change keyboard template
06:31	<Stoffer>	levander, azureus runs under the process name gij-4.1 ... go figure...
06:31	<grego22>	i cannot open gnome-terminal
06:31	<Flannel>	kbidd: lilypad
06:31	<Moosejaw>	anyone know where i can download wicd?  the homepage doesnt seem to be working.
06:31	<lazaruslupine>	supposedly aptitude handles dependancies a bit better when upgrading
06:31	<mojo>	kbidd: g/l.... also, look at the apps that the distro "dynebolic" has... there are lots of media apps you can look into
06:31	<ep2011>	I need help setting up my wireless in the command line at startup - is anyone familiar with this?
06:31	<grego22>	can anybody help me to fix my gnome-settings-daemon
06:32	<kbidd>	flannel, ive used lilypad... i dont remember it having a midi playback feature -- correct me if im wrong though, since its been a long while :P
06:32	<Jordan_U>	Hobbsee, upgrading through dist-upgrade is expressly not recommended
06:32	<grego22>	ep2011,  etc init.d interfaces
06:32	<Flannel>	kbidd: well, lilypad is the main thing.  There are an assortment of editors.  Technically it, like latex, is just a markup language.
06:32	<main>	i thought aptitude gave a cleaner upgrade
06:32	<lazaruslupine>	maybe define your card in /etc/network/interfaces ?
06:32	<harry>	As I understand it, all the settings are stored in my home folder. So if I back up home/harry to a DVD, and then was upgrading to feisty but then for some reason something screwed up & I had to do  a clean install, I would be all good, right?
06:32	<Flannel>	kbidd: Lilypad has stuff that'll play midi, yes
06:32	<grego22>	ep2011,  my kb is broken (thanks festy)
06:32	<mojo>	Jordan_U: what is the *right* way to upgrade edgy to fiesty then, as I am planning to do just that this weekend
06:32	<grego22>	well... it seems that... festy was a huge mistake...
06:32	<Flannel>	kbidd: Maybe not 'lilypad' proper, but something.  Just search the repos for lilypad stuff.
06:32	<kbidd>	ok, thanks guys... i'll look at the projects you suggested.
06:32	<grego22>	6.10 was working pretty good
06:32	<ep2011>	grego22, explain on that? "etc init.d interfaces"?
06:33	<Jordan_U>	mojo, Use update-manager
06:33	<Hobbsee>	Jordan_U: it's supported, but the upgrade tool is better, yes.
06:33	<Professa91>	anyone know where i can get a webcam driver for festy for  my dell xps m1210
06:33	<grego22>	ep2011,  my kb cant type the bars
06:33	<Tom47>	Professa91: have you looked at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam

06:34	<Professa91>	thanks
06:34	<neilthereildeil>	because i dont alway startx whenever i boot
06:34	<ep2011>	grego22, what do I type in there, and does it execute that at startup
06:34	<grego22>	ep2011,   yep
06:34	<lazaruslupine>	no /etc/network/interfaces
06:34	<mojo>	Jordan_U: thanks
06:34	<ep2011>	lazaruslupine, ?
06:35	<grego22>	can anyone help me with gnome-settings-daemon crashed =(
06:35	<J-Red>	Anyone know approximately how long it takes for a CD to get from shipit.ubuntu.com to somewhere in Canada, close to the border?
06:35	<neilthereildeil>	Jordan_U, Cisyouc: i dont wanna have to startx the connect
06:35	<lazaruslupine>	/etc/network/interfaces defines you network interfaces
06:35	<th3man>	damn this channel is packed.
06:35	<neilthereildeil>	Jordan_U, Cisyouc: i wanna be able to connect from JUST the comand line
06:35	<lazaruslupine>	yes exactly
06:35	<ep2011>	lazaruslupine, so if I need to type in a SSID and passkey, id type it there? and how?
06:36	<koaL>	i seem to be lost, where is the httpd.conf located :(
06:36	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  why don't you configure your wireless card in /etc/network/interfaces
06:36	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: I'm not sure if there's a way to connect from the command line and have the applet automatically recognise it if it doesn't already
06:36	<grego22>	and the worst thing its i cant find any help... festy its so young =(
06:36	<neilthereildeil>	wastrel: what should i do there?
06:36	<Flannel>	koaL: httpd.conf isn't used.  apache2.conf, in conjunction with stuff in /mods-available and /sites-available is.  And those are all in /etc/apache2
06:36	<Tom47>	J-Red in he past delivery times have been quite variable .... i ended p simply be ing grateful it came for free
06:36	<mdib>	I was in the middle of the upgrade this pm when the power went out for the entire neighbourhood, now I get failed upgrade when I use the upgrade manager. Is it simply that the server is busy or is something messed up?
06:36	<ep2011>	wastrel, I have that problem too, can you tell me how to do so? I have WEP
06:36	<grego22>	everytime my xserver starts... it says that it cannot open the gnome-settings-daemon
06:36	<lazaruslupine>	you can define that in the interfaces file
06:36	<grego22>	and it cannot open the gnome applet window list
06:37	<grego22>	and it cannot open gnome-terminal
06:37	<grego22>	cannot open synaptic

06:38	<neilthereildeil>	but i conect to different networks, so i want it to be able to connect to different networks-i dont want the cfg file to hav permenent configuration data about the network
06:38	<neilthereildeil>	ep2011: waddu mean?

06:38	<rellik>	there's something wrong with my sound since the update..  in my amarok playlist, every other song is silent.  The equalizer bars dance around, as if it were playing, but thereis no sound..  makes it seem like ubuntu isn't correctly handling sound-card sharing, so when the old song is playing, the new one can't fade in
06:39	<whta>	just upgraded. my main problem is that my login screen is in a bad resolution, causing the screen to flicker and my monitor to display a nice big blue box saying "out of range!" blocking some things that i might need to see. once i actually log in the resolution is fine.
06:39	<ep2011>	lazaruslupine, should I ptu it on the bottom? and like what would I type for a wep code
06:39	<neilthereildeil>	how can i fix this?
06:39	<Unspeaking>	Hi there, awhile back I ordered Ubuntu discs ( version 6.06 ). I got them and was very excited to try them out. I quickly had one in my PC ready to go, but when my pc booted up to the Ubuntu installer, I clicked on "start/install Ubuntu" and it loaded the Kernel and then my pc restarts. I kept trying all the other options the disc had ( check disc for errors, etc. ) and it kept restarting my PC. The only ones that work are boot from harddrive ( boots 
06:39	<Unspeaking>	I decided not to worry and just go about with my XP experience, which I dislike, and now I am back to use Ubuntu. I download Version 7.04 with high hopes of not experiencing the same problems i had with 6.04, however I do run into the same exact problems I had with 6.06 and now I would like help.
06:39	<Unspeaking>	I decided to go to the irc channel and get quick help. I did:
06:39	<Unspeaking>	One of the users told me:
06:39	<Unspeaking>	Press f6 and type "add acpi=off noapic nolapic" to the boot options, I do this and then it loads and I'm happy my pc hasn't restarted yet. However I quickly get this message:
06:39	<Unspeaking>	Please append a correct "root" or boot option - root device "<null>"
06:39	<Unspeaking>	VFS: Cannot open kernal panic - not syncing: VFS unable to mount root FS on unknown - block (8,3)
06:39	<Unspeaking>	------
06:39	<Unspeaking>	I don't understand this, as you can see I'm pretty Linux illiterate. The only Linux experience I had was with Mandriva, and that was very briefly.
06:39	<Unspeaking>	------
06:39	<lazaruslupine>	umm your wep would be the hex key i don't think it takes paraphrasing
06:39	<Unspeaking>	Thanks in advance.
06:39	<Unspeaking>	As that didn't work well.
06:39	<Unspeaking>	Let me personally explain.

06:41	<Jimbo99>	you using amarok?
06:41	<Unspeaking>	Here's my problem: I got 7.04 and I deicded to install it, well when I click on the install option it loads the kernel, it says booting up Linux, etc. And then my screen goes black, my PC restarts, and I'm back on the Ubuntu options screen again.

06:42	<PurpZeY>	Can someone just cut me, straight-up, if there is a serious risk in trying to partition my existing NTFS drive and installing a dual boot...b/c I've spent several hours trying to back up stuff, but, I have over 75 gigs of multimedia stuff and I keep getting write failures...So I am tempted to forego backing up, but, I am really concerned about losing the material on my current partition....
06:42	<whta>	just upgraded. my main problem is that my login screen is in a bad resolution, causing the screen to flicker and my monitor to display a nice big blue box saying "out of range!" blocking some things that i might need to see. once i actually log in the resolution is fine.
06:42	<neilthereildeil>	what is '!'?
06:42	<Moosejaw>	k...never done that before...
06:42	<mojo>	neilthereildeil: the explamation point gets the channel bot "ubotu"'s attention so it can respond to the keyword with info
06:42	<Moosejaw>	i was hoping to use wicd instead...
06:42	<Unspeaking>	Wow this chat is loaded.
06:42	<ep2011>	lazaruslupine, thats perfect, thanks
06:42	<octoberdan>	Can I use http://lalists.stanford.edu/lad/2005/01/att-0245/linux-2.6.10_741-novation.patch to patch a 2.6.20 kernel if I just replace all instances of 2.6.10 with 2.6.20?
06:42	<Jimbo99>	NEIL the reason it doesn't play be default is that the .mp3 format isn't an open free format.  it is proprietary.  normally it costs you money to license the codec.  you simply need to find a codec for ubuntu that allows you to play it.
06:42	<rulus>	whta: you must change your /etc/X11/Xorg.conf
06:42	<mojo>	^exclamation
06:42	<wastrel>	rod:  have you looked at   system >	preferences >	keyboard  ?
06:42	<lazaruslupine>	great glad i could help ep2011
06:42	<Moosejaw>	nomasreryoda can u point me in the right direction of the firmware and fwcutter?
06:42	<lazaruslupine>	suprised i knew the answer lol
06:42	<Jordan_U>	Moosejaw, If you want the firmware on Feisty just install bcm43xx-fwcutter and it will get it for you automatically

06:44	<Unspeaking>	I actually got it to boot up in Live mode last night, I had to go to text mode and type in Live acpi=off
06:44	<whta>	rulus: i didn't see that. is it on the forums?

06:46	<Bsims>	logical volume management
06:46	<kalifonria909>	hmm
06:46	<whta>	rulus: i've already checked xorg.conf

06:46	<PurpZeY>	main: any particular reason that is safer than parting using the CD.
06:46	<kalifonria909>	is that for hardware raid
06:46	<lazaruslupine>	for vnc just open a terminal and type sudo ifconfig
06:46	<neilthereildeil>	mojo: why do we need it?
06:46	<rulus>	whta: and the correct resolution is at the beginning of the line?
06:46	<Bsims>	This doesn't make sense to me
06:46	<lazaruslupine>	to get your ip
06:46	<PurpZeY>	Tom47: It seems that backing up is going to be an impossible task save for a  new harddrive.
06:46	<stellaras>	eck: thank you, i'm now writing you through gaim using my pendrive's ubuntu 7.04
06:46	<mojo>	GluE_: ifconfig at cmd prompt will list your interfaces, such as eth0, vmnet1, vmnet8, etc and their ip addy's
06:47	<neilthereildeil>	why can we have it like windowsmediaplayer or winamp where each proigrams plays media?
06:47	<whta>	rulus: yes, 1680x1050 on all
06:47	<main>	I agree with Tom47 but it work for me this way
06:47	<GluE_>	found it, ty mojo!
06:47	<Tom47>	PurpZeY: ok but that does not change the message
06:47	<Jordan_U>	PurpZeY, Ubuntu uses Gparted also so there isn't much difference
06:47	<kalifonria909>	i need to take u3 off my flash drive and try to use ubuntu on it
06:47	<main>	I've done it a number of times
06:47	<rulus>	whta: if you changed that right now, you should restart X with ctrl+alt+backspace
06:47	<IntruderZ>	kalifornia909 it's for having filesystems that can vary in size, ie you can shrink and enlarge partitons
06:47	<Jimbo99>	NEIL:  after you download amarok and you can verify that it is installed, go into the /usr/lib/amarok and run the "install-mp3" script.
06:47	<kalifonria909>	thank you intruderz
06:47	<lazaruslupine>	get it to work ep2011?
06:47	<whta>	rulus: i didn't change anything. it was already correct.
06:47	<bradenbraden>	linux is good
06:47	<kalifonria909>	i love linux
06:47	<mojo>	neilthereildeil: you only need it for programs that use that framework, like totem-gstreamer.  other programs like mplayer or vlc don't use gstreamer.  it depends on which apps you choose.  also, totem has a xine-back-end version
06:47	<kalifonria909>	it doesnt love me
06:48	<rulus>	whta: strange, it should use that resolution for the login screen..
06:48	<IntruderZ>	I love garlik and linux
06:48	<ep2011>	lazaruslupine, YES! Thank you! one more question you may know, how do I make ubuntu stop mounting on boot my windows partitios
06:48	<ep2011>	partitions*
06:48	<mojo>	kalifonria909: it's just tough love is all
06:48	<whta>	rulus: i don't know why it doesn't :(
06:48	<neilthereildeil>	mojo: why do programs rel on gstreamer?
06:48	<Jordan_U>	whta, Do you have the correct drivers for your card?
06:48	<Bsims>	This doesn't make sense to me, Gnome is normal kde. and windowmaker are tiny
06:48	<rulus>	whta: can you paste your xorg.conf?
06:48	<mojo>	neilthereildeil: because reinventing the wheel sux
06:48	<lazaruslupine>	umm to stop mounting maybe edit them out of your /etc/fstab
06:48	<neilthereildeil>	ohh ok :)
06:48	<main>	Purp it really important you do chkdsk -f on ntfs partion first..
06:48	<Tom47>	PurpZeY: if ts any comfort this is the preceise reason i went out and got an external usb drive for backups
06:48	<rulus>	!paste | whta

06:48	<SeveredCross>	How do I set the image that will appear for me in the face browser?
06:48	<Jimbo99>	neil, amarok doesn't rely on it
06:48	<lazaruslupine>	comment out the line with a # i think
06:48	<notnotvv>	Hello, I'm trying to play with new upstart on fiesty. and a simple exec rxvt with start on startup is not working.
06:48	<catxk>	how large is the download of feisty if I download throuh the update manager?
06:48	<whta>	jordan: when i upgraded, it gave me a new message about restricted drivers for an ATI card which i promptly enabled. the issue was there before and after enabling these drivers.
06:49	<caneri>	kalifonria909..there is a prog to remove U3
06:49	<Bsims>	catxk: depends on how many packages ya have
06:49	<Flannel>	catxk: that depends on how many packages you have installed.
06:49	<rellik>	there's something wrong with my sound since the update..  in my amarok playlist, every other song is silent.  The equalizer bars dance around, as if it were playing, but thereis no sound..  makes it seem like ubuntu isn't correctly handling sound-card sharing, so when the old song is playing, the new one can't fade in
06:49	<Gat0rvean>	Ok, I can boot into the LiveCD fine in safe mode, but not normal, so does that mean when I do an install, I won't be able to use my Graphics Card? Or how will I go about getting drivers that DO work?
06:49	<whta>	rulus: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16724/
06:49	<main>	Purp you don't want any hidden errors on ntfs partion before you start
06:49	<neilthereildeil>	how can i search for packages to install from the command line?
06:49	<PurpZeY>	Actually, a thought occured to me, I have to HDs...If I could clear one off, could I then install Ubuntu to that drive and still have a dual boot setup, then not having to worry about not messing up my other partition?
06:49	<PurpZeY>	two*
06:49	<Jimbo99>	can anyone define what the noapic option does?
06:49	<GluE>	i get a "failed to connect: connection refused (10061)" error when i try to connect to the vncserver from my windows box
06:49	<Flannel>	Gat0rvean: no.  It just means that the diminutive configuration on the liveCD can't
06:49	<catxk>	Bsims, Flannel: not many so many, pretty basic install... an estimate? :)
06:49	<koaL>	do you need to create your own .htaccess file ??
06:49	<Jordan_U>	neilthereildeil, apt-cache search <keywords>
06:49	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: apt-cache search blah
06:50	<main>	yes that would be best Purp
06:50	<Bsims>	maybe 700 megs
06:50	<Tom47>	PurpZeY: your idea works for me
06:50	<rulus>	whta: that does look good to me.
06:50	<maccam94>	Gat0rvean: no, it'll probably use the same driver it's using now. worst case scenario, you get dumped to the command line and you have to install the nvidia binary driver
06:50	<Flannel>	catxk: less than 700, but somewhere around there
06:50	<IntruderZ>	jimbo99 noapic turns off a method of interrupt vector discovery

06:50	<Gat0rvean>	Flannel, so when I do install, it will be able to find a driver that's copecetic to run the Gnome desktop?
06:50	<kalifornia909>	wrong irc command
06:50	<PurpZeY>	So, when I go to do the install, Ubuntu will ask me where I want it do install, and also will re-format or partition?

06:51	<Flannel>	catxk: Well, the alternate CD has 700mb of stuff.  And it contains a bunch of extra stuff.  So, it'll be less than 700.  But I dont have specifics

06:53	<IntruderZ>	Jimbo99, noapic helps with certain types of hardware, when probing for hardware sometimes apic can hang or reboot the system, hence the need for noapic. I have found that sometimes when a kernel is updated I need to turn it on for some of my systems.

06:55	<hector>	if a switch to console mode i can see the error messages
06:55	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: you can, but only do it if you know you need stuff from those repos
06:56	<Jordan_U>	Unspeaking, You shouldn't need to type anything, but if you do it would be the same
06:56	<Jimbo99>	IntruderZ:  I'll keep an eye out for it.  i guess I need to put it in some config file to make it permanent.
06:56	<hector>	how can i stop it from continually execute
06:56	<bthornton>	how do I disable NetworkManager from running automatically at boot on Feisty?
06:56	<neilthereildeil>	isnt it better to enable everything so i can have a large selection of software?
06:56	<Jimbo99>	IntruderZ: keep an eye out for problems, that is.

06:56	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about scsi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
06:56	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: some repos are unsupported others are testing
06:56	<bradenbraden>	hello?
06:56	<bthornton>	tom_: there's no system-wide daemon for that?
06:56	<bthornton>	networkmanager, that is...

06:57	<tom_>	bthornton: umm
06:57	<artabrahao>	Hi, I'm trying to install gnome in a fresh ubuntu 6.4 installatin. I'm using apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, but cant locate the package, any sugestion?
06:57	<kalifornia909>	bthornton try you sessions
06:57	<Jordan_U>	bthornton, Do want to remove it completely ( yes, I believe there is a seperate daemon for network-manager and nm-applet )
06:57	<|ringo|>	artabrahao: run apt-get update first
06:57	<Unspeaking>	Jordan_U: You're right, I completely forgot that when you press ENTER it boots you up, however for me it restarts my PC after it attempts to load Linux. I was wondering if there was a boot code that strictly runs the installer
06:57	<ktulu->	wastrel, the colors look fine, they're just not showing up
06:57	<bthornton>	well I don't care if it's on the hard drive--but this is a hardwired machine, so it doesn't need to be running ever
06:58	<|ringo|>	Unspeaking: i dont know the answer to your question, and if no one else does, just download the alternate cd, which boots in console mode
06:58	<bthornton>	if I simply disabled it from running per user session, wouldn't that still leave a system daemon up?
06:58	<atomiku>	So guys, at the moment my stuff is in a mess, I want grub on one partition, ubuntu on another, then have the computer boot the grub partition. How can I do this?
06:58	<whta>	ok, this update has given me several huge problems that will make me have to go back to windows if i can't resolve them
06:58	<r0bby_>	:(
06:58	<Jordan_U>	Unspeaking, There is a seperate CD for "just the installer"
06:58	<hector>	does anyone have Joost invitations?
06:58	<makuseru>	when i upgraded from Edgy lastnight i got 5 packages saying they didnt install correctly, i have been googling all day, and have tried various things with adept and dpkg and cant get them to install correctly, can someone please help me (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16726/ error report)
06:59	<Unspeaking>	Jordan_U: Do you have a URL to it? If not, I can go look now, though I don't recall seeing it when I downloaded Ubuntu 7.04
06:59	<whta>	aside from my login screen issue, sound has stopped working completely.
06:59	<Unspeaking>	Jordan_U: Infact http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download I don't see one.
06:59	<wastrel>	ktulu-:  dunno.  could try (re)moving your ~/.xchat2  maybe some old setting is messing up the new version...
06:59	<neilthereildeil>	i uncommented multiverse, and apt-cache search mplayer still doesnt return mplayer
07:00	<neilthereildeil>	what now>
07:00	<neilthereildeil>	?
07:00	<Jordan_U>	Unspeaking, It's not easy to find, it's in other options or something like that
07:00	<Dr_willis>	neilthereildeil,  you DID do a sudo apt-get update  ?
07:00	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  you need to download the package lists.  sudo apt-get update
07:00	<ktulu->	yeah, i removed .xchat2 before reinstalling
07:00	<|ringo|>	Unspeaking: notice the "Check here if you need the alternate desktop cd suited for computers with less than 256MB of RAM"
07:00	<lazaruslupine>	you have to sudo apt-get update to get mplayer
07:00	<|ringo|>	Unspeaking: on the link you just gave
07:01	<Unspeaking>	Ohhh I see it.
07:01	<nomasteryoda|w>	Unspeaking, are you looking for the Alternate installer?
07:01	<bthornton>	theoretical/possibly-controversial question: for a desktop machine, which root FS will "feel" faster: ext3 or reiserfs?  Or, if anybody has bothered to compare, is there any noticable difference at all?
07:01	<Jimbo99>	neil:  apt-get update downloads the list of files in that pile of files in that repository.
07:01	<Unspeaking>	Thank you, and yes I was. I have it now
07:01	<Jordan_U>	Unspeaking, http://ubuntu.gds.tuwien.ac.at/cdimage/releases/feisty/ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso
07:01	<nomasteryoda|w>	nvm
07:01	<KalleDK>	IntruderZ: I mount a drive with "mount /dev/sdc1 ~/Disk2" how should that be in the fstab ??? there been some changes since I used dapper :P
07:01	<nomasteryoda|w>	http://ftp.oregonstate.edu/pub/ubuntu-releases/7.04/
07:01	<Unspeaking>	One more question: Does the Ubuntu installer make it's own partition?
07:01	<stellaras>	Jordan_U: can you give me the url you gave me before for the pendrive installation ? because mine is not working..i mean the background is chnaged to default everytime i restart and i cannot find any saved files
07:02	<artabrahao>	|ringo| why apt-get update before the rest?
07:02	<Jordan_U>	Unspeaking, Yes, it will let you resize and create partitions
07:02	<Unspeaking>	I would like to dual boot.
07:02	<Unspeaking>	Okay, thank you.
07:02	<Unspeaking>	Have a good day.
07:02	<lazaruslupine>	to update your repository.... mplayer won't be listed if u just uncomment the line
07:02	<neilthereildeil>	i STIL dont see mplayer in the search results after updating the packaelist
07:02	<atomiku>	So guys, at the moment my stuff is in a mess, I want grub on one partition, ubuntu on another, then have the computer boot the grub partition. How can I do this?
07:02	<Jordan_U>	stellaras, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
07:02	<|ringo|>	artabrahao: apt-get update will read your sources.list file and download the packages that the repos have.  otherwise it doesnt know what repo has ubuntu-desktop
07:02	<stellaras>	thanks again :_)
07:02	<Jack313>	can anyone help me with NTFSResize
07:02	<sam__>	hey
07:02	<sam__>	anyone here
07:02	<sam__>	i need some help setting up webmin
07:02	<|ringo|>	artabrahao: "download the package NAMES" i meant
07:03	<sam__>	i just installed ubuntu
07:03	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK:  what is on the device at sdc1?
07:03	<sam__>	and i got the ssh working
07:03	<sam__>	but how do i install webmin
07:03	<KalleDK>	A harddrive Jimbo99
07:03	<wastrel>	!enter | sam__
07:03	<ubotu>	sam__: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
07:03	<wastrel>	!webmin | sam__
07:03	<ubotu>	sam__: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. Please avoid using it.
07:03	<neilthereildeil>	why is mplayer still not showing up in the search results?
07:03	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK:  lol, i know...what file system?
07:03	<sam__>	ok what should i use
07:03	<sam__>	instead of webmin??
07:03	<KalleDK>	ext3
07:03	<makuseru>	when i upgraded from Edgy lastnight i got 5 packages saying they didnt install correctly, i have been googling all day, and have tried various things with adept and dpkg and cant get them to install correctly, can someone please help me (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16726/ error report)
07:03	<KalleDK>	Jimbo
07:03	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  i'm guessing you didn't enable multiverse properly ?
07:03	<hector>	does the network manager automatically runs a program called bcm43xx?
07:04	<KalleDK>	Jimbo well what dapper used as standard (as i remember that is ext3)
07:04	<Tom47>	makuseru: have you checked out why gub-install did not run?
07:04	<wastrel>	sam__:  i dunno, what were you using webmin for?
07:04	<sam__>	ok if i dont use webmin, i need a program to organize everything, im using an ssh, thingy to control my server, but what should i use instead of webmin?
07:04	<|ringo|>	hector: I believe (someone correct me if i am wrong) but bcm43xx is the broadcom driver for your nic?
07:04	<artabrahao>	|ringo|te will read your sources.list file and download the packages that the repos have.  otherwise it doesnt know what repo has ubuntu-desktop
07:04	<Jordan_U>	hector, bcm43xx is a driver, and yes ( but you need the firmware for your card for it to work )
07:04	<makuseru>	Tom47: what is gub-install?
07:04	<neilthereildeil>	wastrel: i just enabled everything in that file(except the descriuptions of what things do)
07:04	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK:  someting like this:                              /dev/sdc1 	/media/storage ext2 defaults 0 0
07:04	<dcubuntu>	Hello everyone, I am having a problem... I just installed 7.04 and ubuntu will not boot unless the cd is in the tray, it hangs at the splash if the cd is not present in the tray.
07:04	<K>	neilthereildeil: Yeah... enable muntiverse... It shows up just fine here :)
07:04	<neilthereildeil>	i nabled all the sources
07:04	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  do you see "multiverse" anywhere in that file
07:04	<Tom47>	makuseru: **grub-install
07:04	<wastrel>	?
07:05	<omegabeta>	Question: I chose to upgrade Kubuntu to fesity from efty but it got to around an hour left and told me it needed te restart services or some such from a list? and that i should reboot or something.. i was not quite sure, So I rebooted but now kubuntu is broken and when i log in it just reatarts x back to the login, if i simply put the fiesty (ubuntu)disk in will that let me install and keep all files?
07:05	<tom_>	haha feisty is sweet, i cant beleive how many plugins there are for beryl
07:05	<neilthereildeil>	yea
07:05	<whta>	i'm getting absolutely no sound at all. i checked in my sound options in the preferences dialog and selected my sound card for output, but i'm getting nothing. volume is up, everything plugged in/on.
07:05	<sam__>	well what should i do instead of webmin, i mean, i do not know enough linux to just command prompt it, and i dont want to install desktio edition
07:05	<Telarian02>	hello all, I did a clean install of feisty and did a cp /backup/fonts /usr/share/fonts and jimmied something the the fonts up....is there an easy way to restore?
07:05	<artabrahao>	|ringo| nice! How can I ping an internet addreess?
07:05	<dcubuntu>	Question: Hello everyone, I am having a problem... I just installed 7.04 and ubuntu will not boot unless the cd is in the tray, it hangs at the splash if the cd is not present in the tray.
07:05	<tom_>	omegabeta: can you get to a prompt?
07:05	<hector>	Jordan_U, I know that, but how does that program work?
07:05	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  it's probably on a security or src line then, it's not the normal package repo
07:05	<|ringo|>	artabrahao: in a terminal window type ping <ipaddress>
07:05	<lazaruslupine>	ping <address>
07:05	<KalleDK>	Jimbo99... in the new fstab they use UUID ????
07:05	<sam__>	wht would someone suggest instead of webmi??
07:05	<omegabeta>	tom - if i just alt-f1 out of the login screen i can yes
07:05	<sam__>	webmin
07:05	<lazaruslupine>	type man ping to know more
07:05	<sam__>	is phphmyadmin still useable??
07:06	<bucko>	dcubuntu: are you sure ubuntu was installed correctly?
07:06	<hector>	where can i find the firmaware of my wireless card?
07:06	<tom_>	omegabeta: ok then you need to type "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
07:06	<neilthereildeil>	godamn
07:06	<neilthereildeil>	it still doesnt work
07:06	<Jordan_U>	hector, To get your card to work run: sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
07:06	<Tom47>	makuseru: the first error you have is somehing to do with grub-install notrunning and its my guess that because it did not run it would not allow the rest of the kernel configurations to be cahnged either
07:06	<neilthereildeil>	wastrel: i enabled all the security lines to
07:06	<sam__>	anyone know my problem, can anyone give suggestions what to use isntead of webmin?
07:06	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK:  I haven't tried to mount my extra ext3 drives yet under 7.04 amd64 yet.  I don't know about the changes to this new release.
07:06	<sam__>	im not too linux savy lolZ!
07:07	<neilthereildeil>	wastrel: what shul i do?
07:07	<omegabeta>	tom: ok ill try.. thanks
07:07	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK: changes to that.
07:07	<tom_>	omegabeta: that should get the upgrade process going again
07:07	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  you need to have multiverse on the correct line.
07:07	<makuseru>	Tom47: no, its nothing to do with grub
07:07	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  use easysource
07:07	<artabrahao>	|ringo| thanks
07:07	<wastrel>	!easysource | neilthereildeil
07:07	<ubotu>	neilthereildeil: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
07:07	<K>	neilthereildeil: have you just tried "sudo apt-get install mplayer ?
07:07	<rellik>	there's something wrong with my sound since the update..  in my amarok playlist, every other song is silent.  The equalizer bars dance around, as if it were playing, but thereis no sound..  makes it seem like ubuntu isn't correctly handling sound-card sharing, so when the old song is playing, the new one can't fade in
07:07	<K>	maybe for some reason... something funny is happening??? But that would be very odd
07:07	<sam__>	arrg any other programs ubnutu approves instead of webmin>>>
07:08	<|ringo|>	sam__: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2203269
07:08	<Tom47>	makuseru: ok ... what does line 13 tell you??
07:08	<Jimbo99>	NEIL wants to simply play .mp3 files.  I recommended amarok but he wants to use mplayer
07:08	<Jordan_U>	rellik, Are you using ALSA?
07:08	<K>	Amarok all the way :p
07:08	<tom_>	go muine :)
07:08	<KalleDK>	Ok Jimbo99 Well just have to try then :OP
07:08	<makuseru>	Tom47: its not in my grub
07:09	<dcubuntu>	bucko: Yes I am sure it is installed correctly.
07:09	<whta>	i'm getting absolutely no sound at all. i checked in my sound options in the preferences dialog and selected my sound card for output, but i'm getting nothing. volume is up, everything plugged in/on.
07:09	<bucko>	If it only loads with the CD in, then its just the livecd booting
07:09	<|ringo|>	whta: are you sure that PCM is cranked up?
07:09	<crimsun>	whta: what's the output from ``tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat''?
07:09	<Jimbo99>	whta:  the mixer is launched so you can see the controls?
07:09	<whta>	ringo: yes
07:09	<dcubuntu>	bucko:  Ubuntu is installed, grub in installed as well, its not a live cd its the alternate install cd.
07:10	<sam__>	how do i get to directory cd
07:10	<squee_>	Does anyone in here have an encrypted filesystem with feisty?
07:10	<d0lph1nK1ng>	yay for feisty
07:10	<sam__>	i have that
07:10	<bucko>	I don't know about the alternate cd, sorry
=== ubuntu is now known as Cole_
07:10	<sam__>	i have this /opt/webmin
07:10	<whta>	crimsun: 0: Realtek ALC888 1: SigmaTel STAC9750,51
07:10	<sam__>	wht is the cd thiny
07:10	<d0lph1nK1ng>	does feisty come with ndiswrapper?
07:10	<neilthereildeil>	which sources should i include on that website?
07:10	<whta>	jimbo: yes. i believe so..
07:10	<Telarian02>	so edgy and feisty's /usr/share/font directories are not entirely the same and I jacked mine up anyone know where I could get a clean fonts dir?
07:10	<Cryoniq>	Uhm.. Anyone else upgraded from edgy to feisty noticed your system going into hibernate during the night?
07:10	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  community supported
07:10	<crimsun>	whta: please read http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=support and tell me the URL of the paste generated by the script linked from that page.
07:10	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  also the standard one
07:11	<masked_marsoe>	i've had the beta for a week... but i haven't seen any updates... are they delayed?
07:11	<neilthereildeil>	which one has mplayer?
07:11	<MrMakeveli>	does anyone know the command to open a port using iptables command?
07:11	<artabrahao>	ringo in console how can I chance ip, netmask, gatway and dns?
07:11	<d0lph1nK1ng>	does feisty come with ndiswrapper?
07:11	<Jordan_U>	d0lph1nK1ng, It can be installed ( although if you have a broadcom card I would recommend using the native drivers )
07:11	<Jimbo99>	whta:  double click on the sound icon in your panel and it will launch the mixer so you know for sure.
07:11	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  you need both
07:11	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: mplayer is avail by default
07:11	<Cryoniq>	I just woke up and computer was off.. I$B$"(B1000% sure it was up and running when I left it.. 0o
07:11	<neilthereildeil>	|ringo|: it def is not
07:11	<whta>	jimbo: pcm is up. i'm not getting the normal drum beat when the login screen shows up
07:11	<d0lph1nK1ng>	Jordan_U, ndis did the trick n edgy, just couldn't find ndis on the cd like i could for edgy
07:11	<wastrel>	|ringo|:  it's in multiverse so no it's not
07:11	<GluE>	im having troubles connecting to my vnc server on my ubuntu box from this windows box, how would i go about troubleshooting it
07:12	<Cole_>	i have a question, i have just installed 7.04 and when i restart, i get a grub error (21) and cannot boot into windoze or ubuntu. i think i need to mount the drive i just installed ubuntu on and reinstall grub, but i need a little help doing that (if that is what i need to do)
07:12	<whta>	crimsun: i need to download alsa-info?
07:12	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: well if you have a backup of your orig. sources.list, it surely is
07:12	<orbin>	Jordan_U: so they've improved support in feisty?
07:12	<crimsun>	whta: yes.
07:12	<KalleDK>	Jimbo think i got it :) UUID=theid   /mount/point ext3 defaults 0 0
07:12	<Jordan_U>	orbin, Yes
07:12	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: what error messags are you getting with apt-get?
07:12	<Jimbo99>	cole:  you have sata and switch the drive around after you installed ubuntu?
07:12	<smt6k>	Hi, I just upgraded to feisty and now my suspend doesn't work.  Is that common?
07:12	<neilthereildeil>	do i need backpots?
07:12	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: it could just be that the servers are slow becaues everyone is using them at the moment
07:13	<Dial_tone>	can you use a fat32 formatted ipod on a mac at all?
07:13	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  no
07:13	<Jordan_U>	d0lph1nK1ng, I would still recommend at least trying fwcutter before NDIS ( Native Drivers are always better )
07:13	<DigitallyStoned>	hello
07:13	<DigitallyStoned>	what repo is wine in now?
07:13	<Jimbo99>	the servers were refusing to allow me to download packages earlier so that's why i'm here chatting with you all...so expect to have problems downloading.
07:13	<Jordan_U>	Dial_tone, Yes
07:13	<Cole_>	Jimbo99: no, i have a weird setup right now. i use a sata drive primarily for windoze and then have an ide drive with ubuntu on it
07:13	<fak3r>	ok, best kernel to use for desktop?
07:13	<Flannel>	DigitallyStoned: universe
07:13	<Jordan_U>	fak3r, Generic :)
07:14	<K>	neilthereildeil: are you getting errors when updating your lists?
07:14	<whta>	crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/450963
07:14	<DigitallyStoned>	Flannel: so sudo apt-get install wine
07:14	<DigitallyStoned>	should work right?
07:14	<Jimbo99>	cole:  but did you switch them on the headers on the motherboard after you installed?  or did you not have your windoze drive connected when you installed ubuntu?
07:14	<Flannel>	DigitallyStoned: if you've enabled universe and updated your package list, yes
07:14	<Tom47>	makuseru: there doesn't need for anything to be wrong with r grub but it does seem that for a some reason grub-install is not running and for that reason the install script does not finish corectly
07:14	<fak3r>	Jordan_U: so what does -386 or -lowlatency get you?
07:14	<Cryoniq>	hmm.. my menus etc just disapeared in gnome (7.04) lol.. hmm..
07:14	<DigitallyStoned>	Flannel: et me see if he did
07:15	<Ringo>	I tried to upgrade to v7.04 using the package manager and it tells me I dont have enought room in my /boot partition .. any way to expand it ?
07:15	<wastrel>	Cryoniq:  killall gnome-panel
07:15	<Cole_>	Jimbo99: i didnt switch anything, simply plugged that ide drive in, loaded ubuntu and installed it on it (cleaning out my ubuntu 6.04 that was on that drive)
07:15	<Jordan_U>	fak3r, -386 is what you get with Generic and lowlatency helps with serious audio editing.
07:15	<sam__>	-shoot
07:15	<fak3r>	Ringo: remove some old kernels...
07:15	<Cryoniq>	wastrel, thank :)
07:15	<sam__>	i cant donwload webmin anymore
07:15	<Cryoniq>	s
07:15	<sam__>	wht should i do then>>??
07:15	<Ringo>	did that
07:15	<Jimbo99>	cole:  but was the windoze driver attached when you installed ubuntu on the other drive?
07:15	<Ringo>	only one kernel left
07:15	<|ringo|>	Ringo: before trying to resize you could delete older version numbered kernels
07:15	<meng>	for some reason i cannot make beryl-manager start with my XGL session
07:15	<Jimbo99>	cole:  err windows DRIVE*

07:23	<micahcowan>	Jordan_U, yeah, I was just thinking that. Unless -d was meant /only for downloading source?
07:23	<hector>	crimsun, do you mean i paste that data somewhere on the internet and tell you the address?
07:23	<maccam94>	sam__: try ping www.google.com. if that doesn't work, your networking isn't working. if it does (or if you're trying this while in the channel) then the server is just down (sourceforge goes down pretty often). just wait and try again later
07:23	<crimsun>	hector: yes.
07:23	<fak3r>	sam__: do you have sudo access?
07:23	<sam__>	ok i have webmin.tar.gz downloaded on my windows desktop, im using ssh client right now obviosuly, is tehre a way i can transfter, and install the webmin files from my desktop here into my server
07:23	<FernLujan>	|ringo|: HOw can I go about installing common codecs like DIvX, along with Flash, QUIcktime, among other things for firefox

07:23	<Jack313>	Does anyone know anything about NTFSRESIZE
07:24	<makuseru>	Tom47: dunno, you tell me
07:24	<fak3r>	sam__: that's going to be harder...installing the .deb package is going to be what you want

07:24	<ubotu>	Jack313: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
07:24	<sam__>	if i download the debpackage to my desktop
07:24	<sam__>	will that make it easier
07:24	<|ringo|>	FernLujan: everyone in this chat will yell at me for linking you to this but it works so:  www.ubuntuguide.org  Read the instructions on codecs/flash/etc for ubuntu 6.10 (yes i know you have 7.04)
07:24	<fak3r>	sam__: so get sudo, do this `sudo su -` and enter your password
07:24	<sam__>	kk
07:24	<sam__>	did that
07:24	<Tom47>	makuseru: well we will need to think for a bit
07:24	<artabrahao>	ringo in console how can I chance ip, netmask, gatway and dns?
07:25	<hector>	crimsun, ok wait a sec
07:25	<|ringo|>	FernLujan: the instructions on that site for codecs and such are easy to understand and work.  but dont use automatrix for anything whenever that guide says to
07:25	<fak3r>	ubotu: that, and when folks say 'can I ask a question about foo?
07:25	<Jack313>	well, i try to use Gparted to resize my windows hdd, and it just gives this error to check for filesystem problems, and i ran ChkDSk and defrag, and it still wont work, so I am hoping someone can tell me how to use ntfsresize
07:25	<makuseru>	Tom47: how do you know thats the problem?

07:26	<wastrel>	there are no tbird2 debs for ubuntu yet

I disabled encryption on my local wireless network and now it appears with the correct s
07:29	<Heskethj>	trength in network manager. But upon connecting it does the same thing as connecting to it when it was on WAP, that is that is does nothing. A log from iwevent shows:

07:36	<whta>	crimsun: http://pastebin.ca/450985
07:36	<hector>	crimsun, nothing happens
07:36	<nicole>	lol okay
07:36	<mattman>	hey friends, i just did a fresh install of the new feisty, and everytime i boot i get apt-get errors, what do i do?
07:36	<Jordan_U>	ceil420, Be careful, if Gutsy had a candidate you would have just upgraded him to it :)
07:36	<nicole>	basically, I'm trying to use the open source driver
07:36	<eylisian>	Heskethj, interesting.
07:36	<hole_>	hello,i'm having trouble burning audio cds with mp3's
07:36	<nicole>	I have a radeon 9600
07:36	<hector>	crimsun, i'm using the alsa mixer, does that matters?
07:36	<nicole>	and I'm getting (EE) RADEON(0): [agp]  Could not bind
07:36	<imbecile>	how can i install ubuntu? gparted keeps freezing on me.. i have a new box so it shouldnt be that
07:36	<ceil420>	Jordan_U, oh? so how else does he do it?
07:36	<nicole>	I'm getting (EE) RADEON(0): [agp]  AGP failed to initialize. Disabling the DRI.
07:36	<Zal91>	DCC SEND STARTKEYLOGGER 0 0 0
07:36	<Cryoniq>	Anyone else noticed your Feisty fawn gone into hibernate while you been asleep? (I got ghosts here in this place otherwise)
07:36	<jessid>	!wireless
07:36	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
07:37	<sdfasdfawef>	cryoniq: not me
07:37	<imbecile>	how can i install ubuntu? gparted keeps freezing on me.. i have a new box so it shouldnt be that
07:37	<orbin>	mattman: pastebin the errors here if possible: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
07:37	<Jordan_U>	ceil420, If on Edgy then just update-manager with no extra arguments
07:37	<eylisian>	imbecile, sata?
07:37	<crimsun>	hector: keep doing so. Be persistent.
07:37	<ceil420>	Jordan_U, oh, ok
07:37	<Heskethj>	eylisian, yes I have been very confused about it. I haven't bothered with ndiswrapper or anything since the drivers *seem* to be detecting the card. Perhaps it would be worth a try or will that cause extra issues down the road with compatibility. I have read the ubuntu documents and I have not found anything of use.
07:38	<Tom47>	imbecile have you checked/validated the cd?
07:38	<nateman1352>	hi, I just installed feisty and tried using the "desktop effects" (aka compiz) and it was great for a while, but then the cube stopped working has this happened to anyone else, and did you manage to fix it?
07:38	<imbecile>	eylisian:  why is there issues with sata?
07:38	<hector>	crimsun, both Master and PCM need to have the same value?
07:38	<imbecile>	tom yes
07:38	<ceil420>	i updated before the 19th, so -c -d worked :X
07:38	<Jordan_U>	ceil420, One of those ( can't remember if it's -c or -d ) tells update-manager to also look for developement versions
07:38	<crimsun>	whta: err, you created your own asoundrc? No wonder.
07:38	<mattman>	orbin, i can't. i have ti restart, and i lose the copy and paste feature, but i can tell you what it said...
07:38	<eylisian>	Heskethj, seems like encryption might be the issue.
07:38	<ceil420>	prolly -d :o
07:38	<eylisian>	imbecile, sata and certain mainboards.
07:38	<whta>	crimsun: i didn't on purpose :o
07:38	<crimsun>	whta: rm ~/.asoundrc* && asoundconf set-default-card Audigy2
07:38	<crimsun>	whta: then log out and back in
07:38	<sdfasdfawef>	nateman1352: do you still have 4 desktops?
07:39	<nicole>	hey guys, I'm getting issues with my radeon 9600, in my Xorg.0.Log I see this (EE) RADEON(0): [agp]  AGP failed to initialize. Disabling the DRI.
07:39	<Heskethj>	eylisian, yes it would seem that way, but I disabled my encryption on my network and I still fail to connect
07:39	<ceil420>	-c, --check-dist-upgrades                        Check if a new distribution release is available
07:39	<ceil420>	  -d, --devel-release   Check if upgrading to the latest devel release is possible
07:39	<nicole>	I'm using the open source driver
07:39	<makuseru>	Tom47: that fixed it for me
07:39	<mattman>	orbin, it said that apt-get was not currently installed and that i should use the command apt-get install apt to get it back.  it then tells me that a shell script is starting, and to press crtl-d to continue booting
07:39	<Tom47>	makuseru: very good
07:39	<eylisian>	Heskethj, ok. How about pasting the output of iwconfig in the pastebin.
07:39	<eylisian>	and also lspci
07:40	<makuseru>	thanks
07:40	<bucko>	I can't get kxdocker to load...
07:40	<nicole>	hey guys, I'm getting issues with my radeon 9600, in my Xorg.0.Log I see this (EE) RADEON(0): [agp]  AGP failed to initialize. Disabling the DRI.
07:40	<imbecile>	eylisian:  I've installed edgy on this box before but i remembered i had to do something first.. i think i had to make the partition in winders
07:40	<nicole>	anybody know anything about that?
07:40	<paradon>	nicole: I found the open source driver very, very slow after upgrading to Feisty.  Didn't think to check the logs, just upgraded to the binary which is fine.
07:40	<whta>	ok, crimsun. i have no idea what we just did or why we did it, but it worked, and i thank you so much for working with me like that.
07:40	<nateman1352>	sdfasdfawef, it appears I don't... wonder how that happened, anyway do you remember where that preference is (use KDE most of the time)
07:40	<artabrahao>	in console how can I chance ip, netmask, gatway and dns?
07:40	<Heskethj>	eylisian, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16739/
07:41	<nicole>	paradon, I can't get the fglrx driver to work either
07:41	<nicole>	It gives me AGP errors as well
07:41	<sdfasdfawef>	nateman1352... ehh.. im in gnome
07:41	<sdfasdfawef>	but let me see...
07:41	<orbin>	mattman: that doesn't sound too healthy =/
07:41	<nateman1352>	I'm in gnome right now
07:41	<crimsun>	hector: no
07:41	<eylisian>	imbecile, partitioning is good! =)
07:41	<nateman1352>	hence why I don't know where it is
07:41	<Jordan_U>	nateman1352, #kubuntu might know
07:41	<orbin>	mattman: fresh install off cd or an upgrade?
07:41	<hector>	crimsun, i tried every posible value and nothing
07:41	<Heskethj>	eylisian: I don't know why it is listing ra1's ESSID since the wireless *isn't* connected. I am on my laptop now with a wired connection through network manager
07:41	<nicole>	the only way I can get the open source driver to work is to use BusType "PCI"
07:41	<nicole>	which runs really slow
07:42	<imbecile>	ill brb guys
07:42	<whta>	now back to my OTHER problem!
07:42	<hector>	crimsun, it was working a while ago, then i restarted the computer and no sound
07:42	<sickofwireless>	hi, does anyone know how to get Fiesty to scan for wireless networks?
07:42	<kalifornia909>	!supergrub
07:42	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about supergrub - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
07:42	<eylisian>	Heskethj, sudo ifdown ra1 (unless you are using Network Manager)
07:42	<mattman>	orbin, i agree, but the system is fine, after boot.  I did a fresh install from cd.  i just used apt-get to get this irc client... weird
07:42	<volvoguy>	hey all. i'd like to upgrade my breezy server to feisty (or at least edgy) and the documention is obviously for desktop - as it highly recommeds using update-manager and highly discourages using apt-get. is there a safe way to use apt-get?
07:42	<crimsun>	hector: cat /proc/asound/cards    (to pastebin)
07:42	<Jordan_U>	sickofwireless, Top right corner, network-manager
07:42	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, sudo iwlist eth1 scan
07:42	<Cryoniq>	hmm logs tell that system tried to go into suspend because system was idle.. but then it failed.. odd..
07:42	<paradon>	nicole: hrm... iirc the fglrx driver has a bunch of AGP related options...  I played with them some way back under Dapper when it wasn't working... haven't touched them since tho.
07:43	<eylisian>	Heskethj, if using network manager, select disable wireless to squash it.
07:43	<sickofwireless>	!pastebin
07:43	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
07:43	<Jordan_U>	sickofwireless, If that does not work, what kind of card do you have ?
07:43	<whta>	my login screen shows up at a bad resolution; the screen flickers and the text is fuzzy. it looks like it's working at some arbitrary resolution that's somewhere around 800x600 but not quite as my monitor says "out of range." xorg.conf shows 1680x1050 on all lines for resolution.
07:43	<vm>	i just installed fiesty (first time linux'er) w00000
07:43	<sdfasdfawef>	nateman1352, yeah, i forget.  but wherever the compiz settings are stored.. you have to change the desktops to 4

07:44	<RiverRat>	Quick question: does you CD still work as a live CD?
07:44	<crimsun>	hector: next time, please use pastebin.
07:44	<Jordan_U>	sickofwireless, Do you not see network manager or does it not see your card
07:44	<bucko>	riverrat: yes
07:44	<RiverRat>	thanks

07:44	<orbin>	mattman: what happens if you do the recommended thing and apt-get install apt?
07:44	<sickofwireless>	crazytom: ?
07:45	<eylisian>	Heskethj, then bring the interface back up (enable wireless or ifup ra1) then paste the output of dmesg |tail to the pastebin please.
07:45	<sickofwireless>	jordan_u: uh it sees my card, I just can't see (connect) to my network

07:45	<crimsun>	hector: /don't/ paste here
07:45	<yoz>	can someone tell me why when I use VI and i use the arrow keys to navigate..it writes letters like C and B, etc
07:45	<EnsignRedshirt>	I just downloaded the feisty iso, starting from http://www.ubuntulinux.org/getubuntu, but I don't see a copy of the md5sum anywhere.
07:45	<koaL>	is there acommand to kill \ reload a ftp progress in 1 line
07:46	<smt6k>	Can anyone tell me how to track down why suspend to ram and disk are now broken in Feisty Whatever?
07:46	<Jordan_U>	yoz, Because vi is like that :) use nano, it is much more intuitive.
07:46	<Cryoniq>	Question: It seems my computer went into suspend during night and shut itself off. Log files tell it wasn't allowed to do that however. Under power management I noticed that "turn computer to sleep" was set to 30 minutes. what does sleep mean? Does it mean to have it enter hibernate mode? And if that is the case, why did log files say it wasn't allowed to do it? =)
07:46	<mattman>	orbin, well it tells me that apt-get isn't installed... lol so when i try to use apt-get to install itself, we run into errors that mimmick the ones in the beginning (apt-get is not installed)
07:46	<sickofwireless>	crazytom: I click on network config, it does not display the wireless network
07:46	<mattman>	orbin, crazy huh?
07:46	<Keddanonymous>	hello everyone I'm new and I want to try ubuntu
07:46	<DShepherd>	Keddanonymous, well download it
07:46	<orbin>	mattman: indeed.  ... never seen it brought up before.  sorry - not sure.
07:46	<Heskethj>	eylisian, interesting. ifup says the interface ra1 doesn't exist. ifconfig also doesn't list it
07:46	<sdfasdfawef>	Keddanonymous: cool
07:47	<john_>	argh, im having a problem editing my xorg.conf resolution list....i added my resolutions (1600x1200, 1280x1024) and it shows them, but when i pick them i cant change my resolution to the proper 60 or 70 hz
07:47	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, just do sudo iwconfig eth1 essid laptops
07:47	<sickofwireless>	yup
07:47	<eylisian>	Heskethj, oooooooooooh. could you paste the output of lspci -vv to the pastebin please?
07:47	<caveman>	does ubuntu come with wine installed

07:47	<john_>	caveman, not by default
07:47	<mattman>	orbin, it's all good, i'm gonna go search frantically through the ubuntu forums... maybe i'll find some answers
07:47	<Jordan_U>	Keddanonymous, A new version was just released a few days ago, perfect timing :)
07:47	<caveman>	ok thanks
07:47	<Xenguy>	caveman: no
07:47	<sickofwireless>	crazytom: is something supposed to happen?
07:47	<orbin>	mattman: good luck
07:47	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, nope
07:48	<Keddanonymous>	I already have it but when I was installing the live cd I didn't know what to install it on
07:48	<mattman>	orbin, thanks
07:48	<smt6k>	Anyone have any ideas at all for how to track down why suspend to disk and ram both don't work after upgrading to 7.04?
07:48	<sickofwireless>	crazytom: okay. Done that
07:48	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, do sudo iwconfig eth1 key yourkeyhere
07:48	<caveman>	thanks guys
07:48	<legos>	Hello, What is the best CD/DVD burning software for ubuntu, Serpentine isn't working good for me... so anything but that
07:48	<bucko>	legos, try Brasero
07:48	<Jordan_U>	legos, For just data or media?
07:48	<sickofwireless>	does WPA work?
07:49	<DShepherd>	legos, gnome-baker works for me
07:49	<acidtabs>	how do i download beryl themes?
07:49	<TehUni>	legos: k3b, hands down
07:49	<legos>	CD/DVD  >	dvd, audio, data everything
07:49	<DShepherd>	legos, gnomebaker*
07:49	<bucko>	acidtabs, gnome-look.org has a beryl section with lots of themes
07:49	<rickfdez>	hey folks - I d/l'ed the iso for PPC and can't figure out how to get it to boot into live desktop - it always wants to install instead of run desktop
07:49	<Jordan_U>	legos, Gnome's built in tool is fine, Place ->	CD/DVD creator
07:49	<EnsignRedshirt>	So, where can I find the correct md5sum for the feisty desktop iso image?  It is strange that it is not provided somewhere in the download page at www.ubunutulinux.org (or am I blind?)
07:49	<acidtabs>	ty
07:49	<rickfdez>	appreciate any help on how to do this
07:50	<kbidd>	I know this is more appropriate in #medibuntu, but there was no response there -- what codec do i need to get radio working in banshee?
07:50	<Heskethj>	eylisian: hmm, lcpci was rather interesting: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16741/
07:50	<rickfdez>	i'm on a mac and have no problem booting from cd - just can't get live desktop as an option
07:50	<acidtabs>	oh also emerald-themes,beryl-plugins
07:50	<Jordan_U>	rickfdez, When it says "install or run Ubuntu" the OR is important :)
07:50	<TehUni>	rickfdez: sure you didnt get the alternate cd on accident?
07:51	<overshard>	So, quick question, how does one disable the splash screen in 7.04... it isn't under sessions anymore that I could see
07:51	<rickfdez>	i don't get an option asking for install or run - after I press Enter, it just starts the install process
07:51	<DShepherd>	EnsignRedshirt, http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/MD5SUMS
07:51	<Jordan_U>	rickfdez, Unless you downloaded the alternate CD then the default should boot into a working Demo of Ubuntu
07:51	<bucko>	Emerald themes are available on gnome-look.org, beryl-plugins are available thru Feisty repos
07:51	<rickfdez>	(i exit when i get to partition options)
07:51	<rickfdez>	maybe i did get the wrong cd, i'll have to check - what should i look for?
07:51	<kbidd>	overshard, install gnome-splashscreen-manager
07:51	<omegabeta>	Question: If i boot in to the fiesty live cd and chose to make my existing edgy install (sda1) the root (/) and install it that way, will that erase everything or keep everything intact and simply upgrade the dist? I'm having huge issues upgrading and ive pretty much broken everything so i just want to install ubuntu fiesty clean from the cd but keep everything i already have on my existing efty install..
07:51	<Heskethj>	eylisian: sorry, I didn't do it as root. Try this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16743/
07:51	<overshard>	kbidd, thanks
07:52	<rickfdez>	you know what? I did get the alternate CD - i just saw that in the name of the ISO i d'led
07:52	<kbidd>	overshard, np... i spent about an hour today trying to figure that one out myself :P
07:52	<EnsignRedshirt>	DShepherd: Thanks.
07:52	<rickfdez>	what cd do I need to get?
07:52	<Flannel>	omegabeta: What do you mean "everything"?
07:52	<hector>	crimsun, http://pastebin.ca/451003
07:52	<DShepherd>	EnsignRedshirt, no prob
07:52	<Jordan_U>	omegabeta, No, unless your /home is on another partition
07:52	<Flannel>	rickfdez: alt CD is a good choice.  and it'll work.  Unless you need a live environment
07:52	<overshard>	kbidd, hehe you don't like the splash screen either? I've redone absolutely everything but that and feel no need in having a splash screen anyways it just flashes my comp loads so fast
07:52	<omegabeta>	actually, i think /home "is" on another paty.. i just cant bloody remember :(
07:52	<kbidd>	overshard, after you install it, its under System >	Preferances >	Splash Screen
07:53	<Heskethj>	omegabeta, As far as I know the partition will be formatted upon installation, you should back up your /home folders if they aren't on another partition already
07:53	<overshard>	kbidd, kk thanks
07:53	<rickfdez>	flannel: what do u mean - can i boot to live desktop from alternate cd too?
07:53	<acidtabs>	Thanks again Bucko
07:53	<kbidd>	overshard, in the past its nice, but feisty just loads so fast i dont see the point
07:53	<Jordan_U>	omegabeta, You can check with the LiveCD
07:53	<omegabeta>	Flanel: As in, all my files... my music, everything on the desktop etc
07:53	<kosnick>	is there any channel for ubuntu-upgrade?
07:53	<bucko>	np
07:53	<karthik>	Guys i need help!!! when i try to ./configure ALSA its throwing me errors like this...checking for gcc... gcc
07:53	<feistyman>	Anyone, I can't seem to play real video. What do i need for it to work?
07:53	<karthik>	checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
07:53	<karthik>	See `config.log' for more details.
07:53	<eylisian>	Heskethj, looks fine and well there. How about ... it's ok, as a normal user, root shows the capabilities of the device is all. Anyway how about the contents of /etc/network/interfaces?  output of; cat /etc/network/interfaces in the astebin would be cool. it looks like the machine is recognizing it.
07:53	<vm>	can someone help me installing ati drivers?
07:53	<kbidd>	kosnick, no, but to upgrade you need to download the "alternative cd"
07:54	<eylisian>	s/astebin/pastebin
07:54	<willwill>	GDM can't detect my monitor after upgrade to feisty
07:54	<rickfdez>	that's my original question - how do i boot into a live desktop off the cd i f it's the alt CD
07:54	<kbidd>	vm, whats your problem?  I just installed mobility radion 9000 drivers on my laptop.
07:54	<overshard>	kbidd, actually the only problem i'm having in feisty is dvd play back and usplash customization... everything else is fine got byrel and avant up looks nice
07:54	<groboto>	anyone got an opinion about linuxmce?  and/or geforce 6150, hd out of linux mce?
07:54	<pdaX>	I'm trying to install Feisty server on Parallels Desktop on Mac, mapping the virtual CD drive to the ubuntu server ISO, but the installer can't detect any CD-ROM drive... have anybody else been reporting this problem?
07:54	<crimsun>	hector: pavilion dv2000z ?
07:54	<EnsignRedshirt>	kosnick: I don't think so, but it would be a good idea :)  (That, and, say #ubuntu-wireless, #ubuntu-ati, etc.)
07:54	<pdaX>	s/have/has
07:54	<karthik>	Guys i need help!!! when i try to ./configure ALSA its throwing me errors like this...checking for gcc... gcc   checking for gcc... gcc
07:54	<DShepherd>	karthik, do you have gcc installed?
07:54	<karthik>	checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
07:54	<karthik>	See `config.log' for more details.
07:54	<kosnick>	kbidd : what about the net directly? cause i faced some problem with it
07:54	<mjbrooks>	omegabeta, you can't remember if your /home is on another partition?
07:54	<omegabeta>	the live cd option is to etiehr resize etc (which i dont want) or the manual, so i go to manual and it displays a all the parts.. So if i turn my existing borknen edy install from sda1 to / it will just install over it but keep everything.. if you get me?
07:54	<eylisian>	willwill, I would try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
07:54	<karthik>	yes Dshepard
07:54	<maccam94>	karthik: apt-get install build-essential
07:54	<kbidd>	overshard -- oh... i thought you sere talking about the gnome splash (thats the package i gave you -- usplash is different)
07:54	<vm>	kbidd: Well, i have radeon x1600, and i get lost when it tells me to edit conf files and stuff
07:54	<hector>	crimsun, yeah, pavilon dv2221
07:55	<DShepherd>	karthik, try what maccam94 said
07:55	<willwill>	thanks, eylisian. i will try that.
07:55	<Heskethj>	eylisian: cheers, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16744/
07:55	<crimsun>	hector: try: kill $(lsof -t /dev/dsp* /dev/audio* /dev/mixer* /dev/snd/*) && sudo modprobe -r snd_hda_intel && sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel model=laptop-hp
07:55	<overshard>	kbidd, oh no no i wantehd the gnome splash too :D
07:55	<sickofwireless>	crazytom:Error for wireless request "Set Encode" (8B2A) : invalid argument "my key here"
07:55	<overshard>	kbidd, usplash ws just another problem XD
07:55	<vm>	and i sorta stumbled through, then when i rebooted, input not supported flashed over my screen
07:55	<omegabeta>	actually, considering there is only 1 ext4 part and a ntfs and a few reifers, im assuming /home is on the same partition so yes
07:55	<eylisian>	willwill, but know your monitor and video card valuses or stick to the low debconf priority.
07:55	<karthik>	ok Dshepard
07:55	<omegabeta>	ext3*
07:55	<kbidd>	overshard, you can replace usplash with splashy if you want :P
07:56	<willwill>	eylisian, i don't understand your answer. please use simple english.
07:56	<eylisian>	Heskethj, ok. the wireles iface is wlan0
07:56	<rickfdez>	anyone know where to d/l the live cd of 7.04? i'm trying the various servers and all are giving 404 or not found errors - for the power pc version
07:56	<Jordan_U_>	overshard, What is splashy?
07:56	<overshard>	kbidd, i'll give it a shot installing it now... wait installed* it now
07:56	<kbidd>	kosnick, im not sure but if you set the repositories to the feisty ones it should work
07:56	<hector>	crimsun, nop, nothing
07:56	<Moosejaw>	how do i disable keyring manager from asking me for a password when logging into my wpa network?
07:56	<mjbrooks>	omegabeta, if /home is on the same partition as / you need to back it up first
07:56	<NickGarvey>	willwill: don't over estimate how good your hardware is, pick lower settings if you are unsure
07:56	<overshard>	Jordan_U_, a usplash replacement i guess
07:56	<Flannel>	rickfdez: oh.  If that's your question, then no.  Alt CD is just an installer
07:56	<kosnick>	kbidd : i think it sets the repositories itself , doesn't it?
07:56	<eylisian>	willwill, you will possible need to know horiz. sync and vert refresh for the monitor. possible the amount of memory your video card has as well in KB.
07:56	<Jordan_U_>	overshard, What is the difference?
07:56	<kbidd>	Moosejaw, run the keyring manager, and set the manager to allways allow the application
07:56	<crimsun>	hector: replace "laptop-hp" with "laptop"
07:57	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, you have got to be kidding right?  use your wep key. it's probably a number.
07:57	<kbidd>	kosnick, not sure
07:57	<rickfdez>	flannel - yeah, tht's the problem, since I don't want to install
07:57	<netdaemon>	how do i resolve a gzip error code when doing sudo apt-get update?
07:57	<Heskethj>	eylisian: running ifup wlan0 returns an "no such device" error
07:57	<rickfdez>	i want to run live desktop so it doesn't affect my OS X
07:57	<NickGarvey>	eylisian: naw, not if he picks "simple", then it just asks for the size (17 inch 19inch etc)
07:57	<overshard>	Jordan_U_, No clue... i'm just wanting to replace the default ubuntu splash
07:57	<karthik>	Guys another help!! i installed VMware...how to use it...
07:57	<sickofwireless>	my network is set on a WPA key
07:57	<NickGarvey>	!vmware | karthik
07:57	<ubotu>	karthik: VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player"), and http://www.easyvmx.com/easyvmx.shtml can create VMs for it. For VMWare Server, instructions can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware - See also !virtualizers
07:57	<eylisian>	NickGarvey, sweet.
07:57	<Flannel>	rickfdez: Then yeah, you'll need to download the desktop CD
07:57	<sickofwireless>	ok, i'll change it
07:57	<eylisian>	willwill, listen to NickGarvey. =)
07:57	<omegabeta>	gah, because i type in dist-upgrade and that wont work unless i give the -f command which also then braks and i get flooded with dependcy issues
07:57	<pdaX>	Has anybody been having trouble with CD-ROM detection while installing Feisty as a Parallels Desktop virtual machine?
07:57	<FreeNet>	Hi is there any wireless network profiler on ubuntu?
07:57	<eylisian>	Heskethj, hmmm.
07:57	<hector>	crimsun, it tells me to reload the volume control
07:58	<rickfdez>	flannel: thanks - now it's just a question of finding a desktop version for OSX
07:58	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, then you're going to have to install wpasupplicant if it's not already installed
07:58	<eylisian>	Heskethj, pastebin again.
07:58	<Jordan_U_>	overshard, I like the Feisty boot splash for once :)
07:58	<NickGarvey>	FreeNet: "NetworkManager"
07:58	<rickfdez>	so far no luck!
07:58	<Crazytom>	i don't know anything about wpa
07:58	<DShepherd>	how can i duplicate a tab in epiphany?
07:58	<kbidd>	overshard, I have a nice usplash theme i installed today (its a blue theme -- im not a big fan of the orange)... dont remember what its called though
07:58	<Flannel>	rickfdez: Eh?  No.  not for OSX.  PPC or 386?
07:58	<willwill>	eylisian, is it preconfigured? i am upgrading from 6.10
07:58	<NickGarvey>	FreeNet: comes by default in feisty I believe
07:58	<Heskethj>	eylisian, paste what?
07:58	<overshard>	Jordan_U_, I don't like anything that Ubuntu does in the way of GUI interfaces personally
07:58	<crimsun>	hector: do so if you feel inclined.
07:58	<smt6k>	Anyone have any idea how to track down errors in suspend?  It worked in 6.10 but after upgrading, it's all broken.
07:58	<overshard>	kbidd, I got one I want the only problem is installing it :D
07:58	<eylisian>	Heskethj, we need to find out what driver your card uses... lsmod, you can dump the entire contents.
07:59	<Jordan_U_>	smt6k, Do you have an ATi card?
07:59	<overshard>	kbidd, it is built for usplash but for edgy so i'm trying to tweak it
07:59	<FreeNet>	NickGarvey: I cannot find any option to save my network keypass for various locations
07:59	<smt6k>	Jordan_U_, nope
07:59	<eylisian>	willwill, I honestly do not know. I moved from Dapper to Etch =)
07:59	<hector>	crimsun, no sound yet
07:59	<smt6k>	Jordan_U_, I use the i810 thingy
07:59	<Krustayshun>	Good Morning
07:59	<rickfdez>	flannel - for PPC, i'm running a Mac G5
07:59	<eylisian>	willwill, I do still use Ubuntu.
07:59	<Heskethj>	eylisian: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16745/
07:59	<kbidd>	:P
07:59	<LordLimecat>	heyste_, Im having an issue with resolutions/refreshrate in feisty....
08:00	<jacksprat>	is the Ubuntu torrent tracker down?
08:00	<LordLimecat>	hey, Im having an issue with resolutions/refreshrate in feisty....
08:00	<crimsun>	hector: ok, now use "laptop-eapd"
08:00	<NickGarvey>	FreeNet: it should save automatically
08:00	<LordLimecat>	its not letting me choose my refreshrate whenever i change my resolution
08:00	<JamzZz>	hi, has anyone here been able to successfully add the OnTV applet to the panel in Feisty?
08:00	<kbidd>	jacksprat, dont think so
=== sankarshan is now known as sm|test-box
08:01	<LordLimecat>	my xorg has been edited (i believe correctly) to allow higher refreshes, but it doesnt let me pick one
08:01	<jacksprat>	kbidd, i can't connect to it even by proxy
08:01	<NickGarvey>	LordLimecat: try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg", follow the menus and ask questions again if you need help
08:01	<LordLimecat>	NickGarvey, already did that, it still doesnt work
08:01	<FreeNet>	NickGarvey: erm nope i don't think it's saving. it's prompting me everytime i reboot
08:01	<LordLimecat>	and i just restored my xorg
08:01	<hector>	crimsun, what does that do exactly?
08:01	<crimsun>	hector: chooses different models. Apparently the source code (driver) is wrong.
08:01	<rickfdez>	anyone know a working source for the PPC DESKTOP version of 7.04? all the ones I'm trying are not responsive
08:01	<NickGarvey>	FreeNet: its prompting you for the password to use the key you saved.. but not the actually wireless key
08:02	<LordLimecat>	NickGarvey, would it help for me to pastebin my xorg?
08:02	<LordLimecat>	!paste | LordLimecat
08:02	<eylisian>	Heskethj, it looks like it uses an Atheros chipset and I don't see the module loaded. i am lookinig some more into the hardware to make sure it is supposed to be Atheros.
08:02	<mjbrooks>	!resolution | LordLimecat
08:02	<hector>	crimsun, but why it worked later?
08:02	<ubotu>	LordLimecat: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type  sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto

08:03	<yoz>	?
08:03	<overshard>	Farewell, I'm off again
08:03	<hector>	crimsun, yeah
08:03	<crimsun>	hector: does it work from a cold (powerdown and powerup) boot?
08:03	<astronouth7303>	what exactly does the feisty upgrade do in the "clean up" stage?
08:03	<FreeNet>	NickGarvey: yup... i think i got it...
08:03	<vm>	Can someone come into private chat and help me install ati drivers please?
08:03	<hector>	crimsun, wait i think what it is
08:03	<groboto>	vm, want to cyber?
08:03	<kruepke>	yoz: your terminal type might be wrong.
08:03	<Heskethj>	eylisian, I believe it is an atheros chipset, but I assumed the driver loaded correctly since it lists my wireless networks. If you look at: http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/D-LinkWireless mine is the dwl-G630
08:03	<Heskethj>	perhaps I should try the madwifi driver?
08:03	<LordLimecat>	jbrooks, ive done everything in there except sudo ddcprobe | grep monitorrange
08:04	<eylisian>	Heskethj, thx.
08:04	<yoz>	kruepke, how does that get fixed
08:04	<crimsun>	hector: I've been assuming that you've used either headphones or internal speakers, and are unplugging headphones before you modprobe
08:04	<hector>	crimsun, when i installed the nvidia drivers i get an error when i boot my computer so i disable the nv module

08:05	<hector>	crimsun, could it be the nv module?
08:05	<crimsun>	hector: or nvidia, rather?
08:05	<yoz>	kruepke, xterm
08:05	<wastrel>	yoz:  how about    echo $LANG
08:05	<omegabeta>	Here is an example of my issue - http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b143/blindraven/fesity.jpg
08:05	<kruepke>	are you using xterm or konsole or gnome-terminal (if you know)?
08:05	<trey>	anybody know why the upgrade to feisty would lock up at file no 98 of 104 evry fuckin time
08:05	<groboto>	anyone here using linuxmce?
08:06	<trey>	?
08:06	<kruepke>	for me, xterm works right...
08:06	<NickGarvey>	omegabeta: I would highly suggest coping over /home to a new partition, and reinstalling over /
08:06	<NickGarvey>	omegabeta: that is what I did actually
08:06	<rickfdez>	Yeah, found it - it's on bittorrent monster (the desktop PPC version)
08:06	<Heskethj>	eylisian, hmm, the dwl-g630 is listed twice. Once under Antheros and once under Ralink... interesting. I think it might be using the ralink driver, I believe I saw that somewhere before
08:06	<rickfdez>	g'nite all
08:06	<karthik>	Dshepard.thanks...it workd
08:06	<unimatrix9>	hello all
08:06	<omegabeta>	How would i copy it over to another directory from within that screen though?
08:06	<trey>	using the update manager
08:06	<NickGarvey>	omegabeta: the feisty install must reformat the partition to install (I am 90% sure of that statement)
08:07	<mjbrooks>	omegabeta, is /home on sda1??
08:07	<eylisian>	Heskethj, it was in the output of lspci.
08:07	<unimatrix9>	where can i find the artwork for feisty cd cover?
08:07	<kruepke>	yoz: if you try 'vim' instead of 'vi' as your edit command, do you get the same problem?
08:07	<vm>	I have an ATI radeon x1600 can anyone help me?
08:07	<malik__>	how do i make kopete open my mails in Firefox instead of Konqueror?
08:07	<noob_>	hey everyone i have installed Itunes on feisty fawn where would it be located with default settings thru the whole way c:/program files it installed to but that doesn't exist on ubuntu
08:07	<omegabeta>	yes home would be there
08:07	<sickofwireless>	crazytom: sorry my internet collapsed... did I miss anything?
08:07	<noob_>	its a windows distro installed with wine
08:07	<gbutler>	hey can somebody give me a hand getting X running on my laptop w/ ati
08:07	<unimatrix9>	where can i find the artwork for feisty cd cover?
08:07	<Heskethj>	eylisian, yeah. Last time I buy d-link! they even violated the GPL multiple times! :S Perhaps I should try the atheros driver?
08:07	<NickGarvey>	omegabeta: use a boot cd to resize and create the new partition, "mv /media/edgy/home/* /sda/partition/", then reinstall over ext3
08:07	<trey>	so what i needa just sit there and wait when it hangs up
08:08	<trey>	im really really linux dumb here
08:08	<gbutler>	im getting wierd errors with the fglrx and the plain ati driver
08:08	<yoz>	kruepke, no..thanks
08:08	<NickGarvey>	omegabeta: mind you, the command I gave you should be modified.. don't just copy and paste
08:08	<gbutler>	and when i do get xdm/gdm loaded, it stalls after login, no wallpaper ever appears
08:08	<Jack313>	guys, how do i mount my windows partitioon in ubuntu
08:08	<vm>	can someone please help me with ati drivers as well? join #atihelp so its not so damn crowded
08:08	<Jack313>	it says that /dev/hda1 does not exist
08:08	<Jack313>	even though it should be there
08:08	<eylisian>	Heskethj, the drier as near as I can tell a couple of Ubuntu versions ago the drivers are rt2400, rt 2500 and rt2570. You could try the Atheros but lspci is saying it's Ralink hw.
08:09	<trey>	help me im swimmin in ubuntu doo doo
08:09	<NickGarvey>	!ntfs | Jack313
08:09	<ubotu>	Jack313: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions . For write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
08:09	<Heskethj>	noob_, if you view hidden files in your home folder you will fine a directory called .wine, in there your c drive and other files exist. However there are many great media players like itunes and even better to save the difficulty of wine. Have a look at rythmbox or banshee
08:09	<mjbrooks>	noob_, ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files\
08:09	<LordLimecat>	jbrooks, where in the "screen" section does it go? under a subsection "display"?
08:09	<eylisian>	Heskethj, s/drier/diver
08:09	<coldsteal>	vm: whats the problem
08:09	<noob_>	thanks i type that in terminal?
08:09	<gbutler>	does anyone know what it means when X wont start, but the only error in the log is "No device detected"
08:09	<omegabeta>	theres a file on the desktop of the borken edgy install which contains about 200gig of stuff, so ill need that aswell.. tbh, theres stuff all over the place on the broken edgy install, I wish i could just fix it but dist upgrade wont work due to flooding dependency issues
08:09	<eylisian>	Heskethj, s/diver/driver =)
08:09	<NickGarvey>	vm: ask in here so all people benefit from the question/answer please
08:09	<kruepke>	yoz: you should be able to get vim to run automatically when using the vi command. you can set that as an alternative, although i don't recall how at the moment.
08:09	<trey>	i get hung on the upgrade to feisty from edgy
08:09	<PurpZeY>	Do I have to set some specifically "dual boot" option, when I am installing, if I am installing to a completely different HD?
08:09	<yoz>	vim works for me
08:09	<trey>	stops at file 92 of 104
08:09	<vm>	coldsteal: #atihelp so we can talk without the crowded text lol
08:09	<yoz>	thanks again
08:09	<NickGarvey>	yoz: it is very unlikely you have vi installed and not vim

08:10	<trey>	93 excuse me
08:10	<sickofwireless>	hi: can someone help with getting wireless to display, so I can connect to my wireless network?
08:10	<kruepke>	np
08:10	<Heskethj>	eylisian, (gotta love regex). So you think the atheros driver won't make a difference?
08:10	<trey>	go to system
08:10	<noob_>	heskethj i need something that plays streaming media and this one offers radio stations
08:10	<trey>	then administration then networking
08:10	<jasin>	gedit and emacs is better then vi, imo.
08:10	<willwill>	i have tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure and it display thai character that my machine can't display(i use thai locale)
08:10	<SeveredCross>	Can someone help me out with some bash script?
08:11	<NickGarvey>	yoz: "/usr/bin/vi ->	/etc/alternatives/vi ->	/usr/bin/vim.tiny" for me
08:11	<sickofwireless>	it doesn't appear after i updated
08:11	<Jack313>	NickGarvey, can partitions be mounted under LIveCD
08:11	<Jack313>	?
08:11	<SeveredCross>	Let's say I want to execute the same command on a directory full of files.
08:11	<eylisian>	Heskethj, I see a rt61 in lsmod but with no refrence to what it drives. No I don't think it will.
08:11	<mjbrooks>	noob_, amarok works for me
08:11	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: yes
08:11	<SeveredCross>	I know it can be done, but I don't remember the syntax.
08:11	<bradenbraden>	is it fun using ubuntu?
08:11	<jasin>	Vi is not the best just the most popular.
08:11	<SeveredCross>	Is it something like for i in *; something; do;
08:11	<trey>	only if you like dicking with it constantly
08:11	<Heskethj>	noob_ : rythmbox has radio stations in it as well. For an absolutely great streaming program look at VLC: www.videolan.org
08:11	<NickGarvey>	bradenbraden: I think so, ask in #ubuntu-offtopic
08:11	<sickofwireless>	bradenbraden: not if you're trying to get your wireless to work...
08:11	<PurpZeY>	I am getting ready to install, I have the disc, and I want to install to a second harddrive in my machine...Do I have to set some specific option in the setup so that Ubuntu knows it's a dual-boot?
08:11	<sickofwireless>	hence the name

08:12	<trey>	you cant say dic*ing
08:12	<kruepke>	artabrahao: you use 'ifconfig' command to set ip/mask, 'route' command for gateway, and edit /etc/resolv.conf for dns
08:12	<SeveredCross>	Anyone?
08:12	<FreeNet>	is OpenOffice able to open MS Office file for editing and save back to MS Office file?

08:12	<Ernz>	Hi, I have just upgraded to feisty and I notice there is now no option for "toggle desktop view" in the keyboard shortcuts. Does anyone know another way of setting up a shortcut for this?
08:12	<trey>	 i dunno mine just kinda worked
08:12	<NickGarvey>	SeveredCross: hmm.. give me a second..
08:12	<noiesmo>	PurpZeY, no just pick the right drive to install on and when ubuntu adds boot loader grub just install to mbr and it will add you m$ install to boot options
08:12	<NickGarvey>	SeveredCross: tell me what you mean
08:13	<Heskethj>	FreeNet: Yes, when you save the files be sure to select the "Microsoft Word (.doc)" format ;)
08:13	<SeveredCross>	Well.
08:13	<NickGarvey>	SeveredCross: what command?
08:13	<john>	jbrooks, it still shows "50 hz" when i use 1280x1024...is it possible that it IS running at the right resolution?
08:13	<SeveredCross>	Preferably mppdec
08:13	<john>	er, refresh?
08:13	<trey>	feisty upgrade help needed!!!

08:13	<SeveredCross>	Decodes a Musepack file. :)
08:13	<shirish>	john: you can use xrandr and see what resolutions are supported
08:13	<NickGarvey>	SeveredCross: in the repos?
08:13	<eylisian>	Heskethj, I hope this is new to you; http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=132980

08:14	<SeveredCross>	I already have the damn program.
08:14	<SeveredCross>	This has nothing to do with the repos.
08:14	<kruepke>	SeveredCross: you would do something like 'for FILE in * ; do echo $FILE ; done' if I understand correctly
08:14	<trey>	but ill read again
08:14	<SeveredCross>	Thank you kruepke .
08:14	<kruepke>	(replace the echo of course :-)

08:14	<jasin>	You are taking chances on wether you hardware will work if its not listed in the hcl and that goes for all operating systems not just ubuntu linux.
08:14	<noiesmo>	PurpZeY,yep it will auto detect ur xp install and it will be the last option on the boot loader when install completes and u reboot
08:14	<kruepke>	artabrao: np. man pages should help with syntax hopefully :-)
08:14	<NickGarvey>	SeveredCross: I don't think saying "this has nothing to do with the damn repos" is the best way to get people to help you
08:14	<sickofwireless>	can anyone help, anyone at all
08:15	<eylisian>	Heskethj, the rt61 is loaded, so it's just a matter of double checking things against that howto as much as possible. I hope it helps.

08:15	<Heskethj>	I ahve to go now, so I'll look at it later

08:16	<eylisian>	Heskethj, right. Some wireless cards are a drag. I bought a Senao card and am really happy with it.
08:16	<Ernz>	NickGarvey: You got one of those howto's for shortcuts? U can't toggle desktop view anymore because the option is no longer there in Feisty keyboard shortcuts.
08:16	<noob_>	where do i get that media player from? just add/remove?
08:16	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: don't use the command line if you can avoid it, try gparted
08:16	<PurpZeY>	Is there an FAQ/Guide for setting up dual boots with two harddrives, as opposed to partition?
08:16	<SeveredCross>	Woohoo, figured it out.
08:16	<SeveredCross>	PurpZeY: It works the same way.
08:16	<pirujo>	wazz up
08:16	<SeveredCross>	Just let Grub install itself onto the MBR.
08:16	<jasin>	ndiswraper is a messy way to get a wifi nic going.
08:16	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: what do you mean "desktop view"
08:16	<mjbrooks>	noob_, I believe it's in that list,  yes
08:16	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: the gparted gives me errors
08:16	<noob_>	whats the name again mjbrooks?
08:17	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: it says to check for errors, so i tried chkdsk /f and defrag

08:17	<Flannel>	xange: You don't need to use console.  at GDM (thats the login), for session, choose "safe gnome"
08:17	<MWS_>	does anyone think I'm stupid running ubuntu within windows so that I can decrease the amount of security holes on my system when I use the internet?.. You see, I like to use my desktop machine (which is windows ( and windows because ableton live isn't on linux yet ) ) so I like to use the internet securely, now, would accessing the internet only through ubuntu under vmware be a practical...
08:17	<Ernz>	NickGarvey - Like when you hit the button in the bottom left of the screen, you can toggle between what you are working on and the Desktop. There isn't an option any more for that is the Keyboard Shortcuts - is there another way I can do it?
08:17	<MWS_>	...way? Thanks
08:17	<xange>	Flannel: thanks
08:17	<SeveredCross>	PurpZeY: Even if you end up hosing your MBR, just pop in your XP disc, start setup, hit R when it gives you a chance to get to a recovery console and type fixmbr
08:17	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: try ctrl alt left arrow
08:17	<SeveredCross>	That will fix your MBR so Windows can boot again.
08:17	<SeveredCross>	Though Grub is almost flawless. I've never seen it screw up an install.

08:22	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: yes, could you pastebin the output of "sudo umount /dev/sda1"
08:22	<cotton>	Ernz: when I type the command you gave me, it comes up with a menu that you would get if you right clicked
08:22	<Ernz>	Cotton: If it's not working, you will have to install it. Just install the entire beryl package and it will select all the dependencies like that ;)
08:22	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, ok just check you have a couple of directories for me.  when i installed codec i made a couple symlinks to help mplayer etc
08:22	<xange>	Flannel: that didn't seem to help
08:22	<Doctor_Nick>	noiesmo: what?
08:23	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: there is no output of that command
08:23	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, sudo ln -s /usr/lib/codecs /usr/lib/win32 && sudo ln -s /usr/lib/codecs /usr/local/lib/codecs
08:23	<Flannel>	xange: eh?  It shouldve booted you without any startup things (without beryl/whatever) so you could change them
08:23	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: then it worked
08:23	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: try gparted again
08:23	<Jack313>	alright

I uncommented the line in /etc/vim/vimrc 'syntax on' but now vi complains that the syntax command is not available in this version. Any ideas?
08:23	<kruepke>	malik__: I think changing your default browser in KDE might do that...(not sure)

08:24	<diabolix>	are the screensavers available as binaries somewhere in the system?

08:24	<jasin>	You are asking for trouble ussing those things
08:24	<Pawba>	cafuego: Work in MS VPC?  Yea, but you have to change the bitplane setting in X.

08:24	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: you... sure?.. its there..
08:24	<malik__>	kruepke: how do i do that?
08:24	<Pawba>	cafuego: Awesome answer, but I was wondering if it worked "out of the box" this time.
08:24	<Doctor_Nick>	a .avi, divx
08:24	<Ernz>	Cotton: Now ur getting me confused! lol >>>>>>>>>>>>>>	beryl-settings !!! <<<<<<< hehe
08:25	<jasin>	vlc will play anything you throw at it
08:25	<Doctor_Nick>	i have ffmpeg installed and such
08:25	<mjbrooks>	Doctor_Nick, install VLC
08:25	<jasin>	http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ubuntu.html
08:25	<Doctor_Nick>	VLC works fine
08:25	<zbus>	cafuego: ok .. so vim-tiny is not what I want. Thanks I'll install vim
08:25	<cotton>	Ernz: :P That comes up with a menu that you would normally get if you right clicked something
08:25	<Doctor_Nick>	but im talking about other players
08:26	<Ernz>	Cotton. What, a context menu?
08:26	<cotton>	yea
08:26	<xange>	Flannel: I selected 'failsafe GNMOE' (I'm on fawn)
08:26	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, i thinks u need some xine codecs as kaffine uses xine engine
08:26	<Doctor_Nick>	k
08:26	<Ernz>	Cotton: ....wtf? Try reinstalling the entire beryl package, remember to delete the settings folder that relate to it in Home
08:26	<Flannel>	xange: right.  That's the one.  Starts up without any of the gnome startup stuff.  I suppose it depends on how beryl does it.
08:27	<Ernz>	NickGalvary: Can I send you a screenshot somehow of what I have?
08:27	<xange>	Flannel: I acctually ended up removing beryl and beryl-manager so I don't know what is going on now...
08:27	<kruepke>	malik__: use the System Settings app
08:27	<cotton>	Ernz: What settings folder? I just upgraded to 7.10
08:27	<foxiness>	hi, i want to know if there something similar to apt-get autoremove on aptitude coz am aptitude user "and more clean to use aptitude imo"
08:27	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, sudo apt-get install libxine-extracodecs libmad0 try these two
08:27	<cotton>	And, is there a simple command I can use to repair beryl
08:27	<kruepke>	malik__: are you using KDE as your desktop?
08:27	<jasin>	Only thing vlc for linux wont do is real stuff, amr, and captioning.
08:28	<Ernz>	Cotton: I would delete .beryl and .emerald, and then reinstall the lot
08:28	<mjbrooks>	cotton, 7.10?!!  you time traveller you!  How is Gutsy Gibbon running for you?
08:28	<cotton>	lol
08:28	<cotton>	7.04
08:28	<foxiness>	heh
08:28	<jasin>	http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html
08:28	<Doctor_Nick>	more like gusty gibbon
08:28	<Cosmo_>	when I run nvidia-settings and enable my second monitor in the server display configuration I click on the "save to X configuration file" and have it save it but when I restart it is back to the single display, how do I fix it to keep the settings?
08:28	<malik__>	kruepke: yes i am using kubuntu fiesty
08:29	<kruepke>	malik__: ok, then System Setting and click KDE Components
08:29	<Doctor_Nick>	woop
08:29	<Doctor_Nick>	that did it
08:29	<Doctor_Nick>	thanks noiesmo
08:29	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, np :)
08:29	<kruepke>	You should be able to change Web Browser in there.
08:29	<Ernz>	Cotton: just go to synaptic package manager and mark for complete removal of the 'beryl' package and the 'emerald' package. Then delete the folders, then reinstall both of those packages. Restart X and fire up beryl-settings. See what happens
08:29	<kruepke>	If that does not help, I'm stumped.
08:29	<Pawba>	hm
08:29	<jasin>	The helix player and RealPlayer is better at playing real media stuff.
08:29	<hector>	how do i execute bittorrent in the terminal?
08:29	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: nope, same error on gparted
08:29	<Flannel>	hector: btdownloadcurses [torrent] 
08:30	<Jack313>	im going insane
08:30	<Ernz>	NickGarvey: Can I send you a file?
08:30	<mjbrooks>	malik__, kopete has a setting in it's configuration for that I believe
08:30	<Flannel>	hector: bt[tab] [tab]  will give you a list of all the stuff
08:30	<h-chew>	hector, check out rtorrent
08:30	<Flannel>	hector: there's a few options,d epending on what you want your UI to be, and how many you need to download at the same time
08:30	<jasin>	Is opera for linux faster then firefox?
08:30	<xange>	Flannel: my, bad I didn't mean to close irrsi, did you say anything while I was reconnecting?
08:30	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: what errors?
08:30	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: what file?
08:30	<foxiness>	apt-get autoremove == aptitude ??????
08:30	<Flannel>	xange: nope
08:30	<Ernz>	NickGarvey: PNG of my Shortcuts view
08:31	<noiesmo>	jasin, there is swiftfox a cutdown of firefox much faster than firefox
08:31	<squitijax>	foxiness: no
08:31	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: alright
08:31	<xange>	Flannel: k, I'll keep playing around see if I can find anything...thanks
08:31	<Tex_Arcana>	My Feisty up grade almost went smoothly. Xorg is okay and I have the video drivers and it boots up but there is a problem.
08:31	<Pawba>	7.04 seems to be taking a very long time at the "Loading, please wait..." and I'm not seeing the splash screen that was in 6.10...
08:31	<pwabbie>	hi guys, sorry to but in like this: Can anyone of you recommend an in-memory caching easy-to-setup dns server that I can use on my gateway xubuntu machine? I am doing to web-dev work from another pc on the network, and I would like to make a custom dns-ip entry that will be visible to all the pc's on the network?
08:31	<jasin>	noiesmo, yes, that's right.
08:31	<squitijax>	Is there a text-based installer in the x86-desktop cd?
08:31	<cotton>	Ernz: When I mark beryl for remove, it only marks a few other folders, should I delet everything with beryl?
08:31	<Flannel>	squitijax: no.  You'll need the alternate CD
08:31	<noiesmo>	jasin, ;)
08:31	<malik__>	mjbrooks: i cudnt find it if u can tell me where abts or which tab i ll be grateful
08:31	<Tex_Arcana>	I can only use a very few programs. A lot of the apps I use like Bluefish, GIMP, the Theme Manager, even going too deeply in my own home files causes the whole system to freeze.
08:32	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16748/
=== knoppix__ is now known as flight
08:32	<jasin>	noiesmo, isn't swiftfox  just firefox compiled specifically for the type of cpu you have though?
08:32	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: those are the ntfsresize errors, let me find the gparted errors, one sec
08:32	<Ernz>	Cotton: Yes, they are all associated with beryl, to make it work. One of those might be broken or corrupted so yes, just remove whatever it selects too.
08:32	<noiesmo>	jasin, u could be right still faster though :0
08:32	<squitijax>	Flannel: the problem I'm having is related to 'GNOME Session Manager"
08:32	<flight>	Can anone help me with using chroot.. it keeps giving me permisison errors
08:33	<Ernz>	NickGarvey: File transfer box says its waiting for you to accept
08:33	<dave132>	feisty upgrade actually fixed things I thought were working but were broke
08:33	<mjbrooks>	malik__, I can't open mine because I'm still in the development release and it SIGSEGV's on me, but look in the menus on the main window for "settins" or "Preferences"
08:33	<foxiness>	squitijax: k , what the option i have now ? any recommand ? did autoremove will make aptitude unstable ?
08:33	<squitijax>	Flannel: if it can be resolved by not having me download another iso, I'ld be grateful
08:33	<siimo>	hi has Breezy Badger support officially ended?
08:33	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: strange, I got no notice, could you use imageshack.us or something?
08:33	<jasin>	if you have 128 - 256 mb you don't need the alternate cd you can use xubuntu, so being your video card is supported.
08:33	<flight>	I'm really about at my wits end here
08:33	<jasin>	xubuntu is way better then the alternate cd
08:34	<squitijax>	foxiness: what are you trying to do?
08:34	<hector>	I disable the nv module to get the graphics card to work but now i get no sound, what can I do?
08:34	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: here is the gparted error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16749/

08:34	<PurpZeY>	Hey all, I am in the midst of an install. It will be dual boot with two harddrives. I know I am selecting the right harddrive in the "partition manager"/Prepare disk space...but then the install asks me if I want to migrate any users, is this just so I can access my windows files in Ubuntu? I just want to make sure I don't format/partition my other harddrive
08:34	<foxiness>	squitijax: nothing then apt-get informd me about the package not used any more
08:34	<flight>	I'm trying to mount my edgy installation to backout a couple patches... but when I try ot chroot I get ... /bin/bash permission denied
08:35	<Pir8>	Has anyone installed JBoss on their ubuntu install ?
08:35	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: ERROR: Device '/dev/sda1' is mounted. You must 'umount' it first.
08:35	<NickGarvey>	!anyone | Pir8
08:35	<ubotu>	Pir8: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
08:35	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: one second
08:35	<Pir8>	Does anyone have any experience installing and deploying JBoss on Ubuntu?
08:35	<PurpZeY>	Hehe
08:35	<Pir8>	:)
08:35	<BHSPitMonkey>	I just double-clicked a .swf, and Totem promptly invoked a kernel panic.  Brought me down hard.
08:35	<Ernz>	PurpZey: I haven't had any experience with this, but from what I understand this should import your windows settings provided you enter the account details for that windows login (password etc..)
08:36	<mjbrooks>	!anyone >	Pir8
08:36	<BHSPitMonkey>	swfdec bug perhaps?
08:36	<ale1>	My gs sucks when I upgrade to 7.04, any clues?
08:36	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: didnt i do so already?
08:36	<PurpZeY>	Ernz: That's what I thought, but since I am messing with partitions I just wanted to make VERY sure I wasn't doing something else.
08:36	<siimo>	no one cares :(
08:36	<Jack313>	NickGarvey:  besides, i downloaded the script that automounts the drive at /media/sda1
08:36	<Ernz>	PurpZey: Even if you do delete it all by accident it will be really exciting eh?
08:36	<jasin>	Who wants to be stuck at the command line, especially if you are migrating from windows.
08:37	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: um.. what.. script..
08:37	<PurpZeY>	Ernz: That is one word to describe it.
08:37	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: that would be your error
08:37	<jasin>	whats gs?
08:37	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: it is from the link you sent me, about mounting NTFS
08:37	<mau>	ale1: Same for me too.  My FPS have dropped a lot.  (7600GT).  It's probably a driver problem.
08:37	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: oh.. well stop it
08:37	<Jack313>	how?
08:37	<Ernz>	PurpZey, I used Edgy to install on another physical hard disk after I installed windows and Dual boot worked just fine, you should be OK.
08:37	<underwatercow>	Does anyone know how to get the button on the side of my mouse to function as a back button?
08:37	<flight>	it chroot totally broken or what?
08:38	<PurpZeY>	=)

08:38	<sickofwireless>	my wireless card is found, but I can't seem to 'connect' to my wireless network... Read a LOT of documentations but they were no help... iwconfig can see my network, but the network manager cannot... anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?
08:38	<Tex_Arcana>	Does anyone have a solution to why a lot of the programs on my new Feisty upgrade are freezing my system?
08:38	<BHSPitMonkey>	underwatercow, actually, listen to ubotu.
08:38	<SlickMcRunfast>	How well does Photoshop run in Wine or Crossover?
08:38	<squitijax>	foxiness: apt-get doesn't start up all by itself
08:38	<underwatercow>	lol, awesome
08:38	<underwatercow>	thanks
08:38	<Jack313>	NickGarvey:how might i stop it?
08:39	<underwatercow>	I tried doing a search, but I didn't know what to look for exactly
08:39	<squitijax>	foxiness: what was the last command beginning with 'apt-get' you typed in?
08:39	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: I don't know what "it" is actually.. how did you start it?
08:39	<jasin>	gimp can do most anything photoshop can.
08:39	<moDumass>	BHSPitMonkey it seems keyboard shortcuts dont really remember the keyboard shortcuts anyway
08:39	<Ernz>	SlickMcRunfast: Crossover is a rip off! - Everything you can do in that you can do as well in a virtual machine running windows
08:39	<mjbrooks>	!anyone >	Tex_Arcana
08:39	<cotton>	Ernz: How do I re-install everything?
08:39	<sickofwireless>	anyone?
08:39	<jasin>	gimp is a very nice photoshop alternative.
08:39	<SlickMcRunfast>	I working on converting some friends and they want photoshops
08:39	<savvas>	i have a problem with ubuntu 386 alternate jigdo: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16750/
08:39	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: you can use gconf-editor to do this.. although you shouldn't need too..
08:39	<foxiness>	squitijax: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid  "by mistake am usually use aptitude"
08:39	<moDumass>	jasin, if your used to a well designed user interface then gimp has nothing on photoshop
08:39	<Ernz>	Cotton: Easy, Have you already deleted those to folders in your Home?
08:39	<BHSPitMonkey>	SlickMcRunfast, good to check wine's AppDB (google it) for wine compatibility; also see #winehq
08:39	<underwatercow>	gimp is nice... thought the interface is a little... clunky at times
08:39	<underwatercow>	though*
08:40	<Jack313>	i wget'd it and started it
08:40	<mjbrooks>	!patience >	sickofwireless
08:40	<cotton>	Ernz: Wait, what folders?
08:40	<squitijax>	foxiness: okay. what error did this give you?
08:40	<SlickMcRunfast>	does the DB contain the tested system specs
08:40	<trey>	ok still get stuck in the feisty upgrade
08:40	<hector>	there's a command to enable linux restricted modules?
08:40	<BHSPitMonkey>	gimp is awesome, but it doesn't replace photoshop, unfortunately.
08:40	<Jack313>	!ntfs

08:47	<NickGarvey>	Jack313: no, if it is unmounted... then that command won't do anything
08:47	<underwatercow>	Tarkus: They are pretty similar

08:48	<underwatercow>	NickGarvey: I knew what you meant, lol
08:48	<moDumass>	?
08:48	<Geoffrey2>	mjbrooks, interesting how that changed...in Dapper and Edgey, it was included...oh well, times change....
08:48	<Laizerox>	I NEED HELP WITH THIS: /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off <- IT COMES ON BOOT
08:48	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, here's a tip
08:48	<Ernz>	NickGarvey: Sorry pal, I am lost here. I searched "keybindings" which search should I be looking at?
08:49	<CVirus>	Shouldn't apt-get autoclean remove all the packages inside /var/cache/apt/archives ?
08:49	<h-chew>	is medibuntu an official apt repository?... i like to keep my apt sources 'clean' to make upgrading smoother...
08:49	<savvas>	gasper: which graphics card do you have?
08:49	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: oh I'm sorry, get rid of the old search and do "show_desktop" for your search query
08:49	<gasper>	nvidia 6600 gt
08:49	<savvas>	!nvidia | gasper
08:49	<ubotu>	gasper: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
08:49	<gasper>	have drivers from page alreadz
08:49	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, do a "sudo tail -f /var/log/messages"  and you can watch the file in real time
08:49	<Ernz>	NickGarvey: Ahh, by bad. Will search now
08:49	<secion8>	does feisty fawn support bcm43xx rev 2 cards?
08:49	<Shaezsche>	how can i change the defualt governors for cpu scaling
08:49	<savvas>	gasper: read the help document, it's pretty easy :)
08:50	<jasin>	jbrooks,  he wont go near paintshop.
08:50	<mjbrooks>	Geoffrey2, they're trying to consolidate it where they can
08:50	<NickGarvey>	secion8: yeah, you need the package linux-wlan-ng or something I think
08:50	<NickGarvey>	secion8: _I think_
08:50	<sickofwireless>	is there a channel for network specific helps?
08:50	<Shaezsche>	hey most of these packages that medibuntu lists are already in the ubuntu repos....
08:50	<moDumass>	gasper i found this site which really helped when i was installing drivers.. http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Troubleshooting_nVidia#An_automatic_easy_solution_for_.28almost.29_all_problems
08:50	<Tex_Arcana>	It's working att it. No freezing yet. I'm starting to wonder if I need to look at glx. Terminal will freeze, opera and firefox are fine but X-chat will freeze.
08:50	<secion8>	ok Thanx
08:51	<CVirus>	Shouldn't apt-get autoclean remove all the packages inside /var/cache/apt/archives ?

08:51	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, definately weird

08:51	<Tex_Arcana>	That's why it drives me nuts. lol
08:52	<NickGarvey>	Ernz: hm, I would think... <super>d

09:12	<Lukemob>	Hello there. Anyone know, what does it mean? "Unable to locate RSDP"
09:12	<PurpZeY>	How can I find out the address for a particular repository?
09:12	<Jordan_U>	Azureday, The open source bcm43xx driver in Feisty is much improved
09:12	<Tex_Arcana>	Okay still having problems with some (most) programs freezing up in my Feisty upgrade from Edgy. Even changing my screen background is impossible.
09:12	<beernutz>	just did the upgrade on my big box, and it APPEARS that the 3ware sata raid drivers did not get included in the initramfs of the new kernel because it dont see ANY drives (the /drives directory does not even exist under /dev/) can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this please?
09:13	<Jordan_U>	Azureday, Sorry, ignore that last comment :)
09:13	<Azureday>	to Jordan:how can I install it?
09:13	<Azureday>	....
09:13	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, really   ?  hmm
09:13	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, did you do an upgrade or a fresh install??
09:13	<Azureday>	I tried NDISwrapper in Edgy
09:13	<Jordan_U>	Azureday, Or not, I am tired... Anyways sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
09:13	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, doh!  you sad that already  lol
09:13	<cafuego>	Or use my prepackaged firmware for fun and profit.
09:14	<Azureday>	o,thanks a lot
09:14	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, how hard would it be to do a fresh install?
09:14	<Lukemob>	Any idea?
09:14	<Tex_Arcana>	Mjbrooks it was an upgrade. I even followed the instructions on the upgrade page.
09:14	<PurpZeY>	I actually see a line in my sources.list that includes feisty-security universe, that mean it is already enabled?
09:14	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, yeah,  but they have been know to not work too well for some systems
09:14	<Azureday>	I will try it now
09:15	<Jordan_U>	Azureday, You may have blacklisted the driver when you installed NDIS wrapper though so you may have to undo that for bcm43xx to load automatically at boot
09:15	<Helmi>	good morning guys
09:15	<Azureday>	I know that
09:15	<Azureday>	but I have reinstalled ubuntu
09:15	<Helmi>	can anyone tell me how to mount LVM volumes from the live-cd? i gotta backup some  data due to a failed upgrade to feisty
09:15	<hamp_>	I just installed Democracy through automatix and its not in the applications list
09:15	<hamp_>	how can i open it?
09:15	<Azureday>	so there is no problem
09:15	<Lukemob>	Anyone know, what does it mean? "Unable to locate RSDP".
09:16	<Tex_Arcana>	Ummm a fresh install would probably delete a lot of hard work saved to disk. Hoping to fix the upgrade before resorting to final solution
09:16	<krezel>	I'm trying to run 7.04 on Parallels and it seems to hang on a blank screen after it finishes the text mode portion of the boot
09:16	<hamp_>	I just installed Democracy through automatix and its not in the applications list
09:16	<hamp_>	I just installed Democracy through automatix and its not in the applications list

09:16	<Lukemob>	...
09:17	<beernutz>	Hey all, Just did the upgrade from edgy to feisty via the instructions on the Ubuntu page (-server is the flavor i use) for my big box. It APPEARS that the 3ware sata raid drivers did not get included in the initramfs of the new kernel because it does not see ANY drives (the /drives directory does not even exist under /dev/) can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this please?
09:18	<hamp_>	Jordan_u i have to type that in terminal every time to run it or what?
09:18	<jasin>	I'm having an issue with a synaptic touchpad, its seems installing feisty fawn didn't fix anything as far as my touchpad is concerned.
09:19	<Jordan_U>	hamp_, You can create a menu item for it with alacarte
09:19	<jasin>	beernutz, use the instructions they provide, step by step.
09:19	<wolke>	hi! does any of you run metisse?
09:19	<beernutz>	jasin: what instructions do you mean?
09:20	<gasper>	before i was asking 4 help installing graphic card, and someone gave me an internet address... could u do it again please, i forgot to bookmark :S
09:20	<Lukemob>	I have really no idea where to get help.
09:20	<jasin>	beernutz, the one's listed on the ubuntu website, see: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
09:20	<Jordan_U>	Lukemob, Where are you getting that error
09:20	<Jordan_U>	?
09:21	<Lukemob>	Jordan_U, when starting.
09:21	<beernutz>	jasin: right, those are the ones i used specifically.  The upgrade seemed to go properly, but the reboot is where i have a problem when trying to use the new kernel..  2.6.20-15 i think it is
09:21	<jasin>	beernutz,  you on a laptop?
09:21	<Lukemob>	Jordan_U, Booting kernel ... Ok - ACPI: Unable to locate RSDP.
09:22	<beernutz>	jasin: no sir.  big stinking server
09:22	<Jordan_U>	Lukemob, Try booting with noacpi
09:22	<gasper>	ok, I need to install graphic drivers 4 nvidia 6600, could someone help me, by giving me link with help/directions
09:22	<Lukemob>	How to? I'm too new in Ubuntu.
09:22	<Jack313>	hey
09:22	<Jordan_U>	gasper, Are you on Feisty?
09:22	<jasin>	beernutz, press esc at startup to select the kernel you'd like to use
09:22	<Lukemob>	Jordan_U, How to? I'm too new in Ubuntu.
09:22	<Jack313>	I FINALLY got my hdd resized
09:22	<Braden>	i'm not
09:22	<gasper>	idon't know :S
09:23	<h1l4nd0r>	hi, i can't login into my default session :( it says can't open /etc/profile but it exists
09:23	<gasper>	just installed ubuntu from web

09:23	<Jack313>	i now have 13gb free space, what should i partition it as?
09:23	<Jack313>	what fs?
09:23	<beernutz>	jasin: yes, that is how i am able to xchat with you now.  i am using the previous kernel.
09:23	<Helmi>	anayone ideas how to mount lvm volumes from the live cd?
09:24	<john>	just an FYI for anyone in here who cares.....dont use the built in nvidia restricted drivers for gaming
09:24	<Jerichau>	jack313: ext3 probably
09:24	<enry_>	how can install math for Open Office?????
09:24	<john>	WoW totally lags to hell if you dont use official nvidia 9755 drivers -_-
09:24	<jasin>	Jack, you only need two partitions, / and swap
09:24	<Jordan_U>	Lukemob, When you boot press escape to see the grub menu ( if you don't see it by default ) then hit "e" if its your  booted system or F6 if it's the liveCD and add "noacpi" to the list of kernel parameters
09:24	<beernutz>	jasin: i would like to know how to fix the problem with the sata raid card drivers.  ( i think that is the problem anyway.)
09:24	<enry_>	how can install math for Open Office?????
09:24	<Jack313>	jasin: 2 partitions?
09:24	<Jordan_U>	enry_, It should be installed by default
09:25	<enry_>	no
09:25	<ompaul>	Jack313, default ext3 and leave a little 2x your ram for swap up to a max of a gig - (if you ever need more than a gig swap you are in deep trouble on a desktop)
09:25	<gasper>	ok, i guess i'll search more :S
09:25	<Lukemob>	Ah, thanks Jordan_U. I'm going to try it now. Be right back.
09:25	<jasin>	Jack313,  yep, thats all ubuntu needs, a / partition and a swap partition
09:25	<enry_>	Jordan_U,  in my feisty no
09:25	<h1l4nd0r>	please help, Can't open /etc/profile error
09:25	<Jack313>	oh
09:25	<drumline_>	Anyone truge through Beryl in VMWare?  >;-)

09:26	<h1l4nd0r>	please help, Can't open /etc/profile error
09:26	<ompaul>	Jack313, go to type where is says ext3 and change that to "swap" it is its own format
09:26	<Jerichau>	h1l4nd0r, you trying to do that as root or as an unprivilaged user?
09:26	<Jordan_U>	enry_, Install openoffice.org-math
09:26	<cellojoe>	how can I upgrade to feisty with the Desktop CD?
09:26	<mjbrooks>	h1l4nd0r, what are you trying to do?
09:26	<Jordan_U>	cellojoe, You can't :(
09:26	<jasin>	beernutz, I dont know how you are going to fix this, but if it were my system i'd compile my own kernel and have modules for that loaded in it.
09:26	<ompaul>	Jack313, and lastly make the / part "bootable"
09:26	<BHSPitMonkey>	Hmm.   Someone know of an app to batch-convert lots of images?
09:27	<cellojoe>	Jordan_U: darn. can i upgrade using any of the disks?
09:27	<Jordan_U>	cellojoe, Only the alternate install CD
09:27	<Yodude>	hello, i am having a serious problem in Feisty, i ahev a LAN internet connection
09:27	<cellojoe>	gotcha
09:27	<Jack313>	umm slight problem
09:27	<Jerichau>	upgrading from a previous version of ubuntu still considered risky? :)
09:27	<Jack313>	i just partitioned for 12gb ext3, and it says the 1gb is unusable?
09:27	<Jack313>	WTF?
09:28	<Yodude>	and i set it up but it's not working although i'm sure the IP number is right
09:28	<jasin>	Jack313, your / partition is an ext3 partition.
09:28	<sickofwireles1>	what was the command for changing brightness? gamma or something?
09:28	<junmin>	how to install radeon driver?
09:28	<beernutz>	jasin: well the 3ware sata drivers are in the linux tree so they SHOULD be there and loading already.  I wonder if there would be any problem in waiting for the next kernel release to hit the update manager?
09:28	<jasin>	Jack313, thats the root partition, where everything builds off of.
09:28	<shazzr_>	i tried to do a "apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment", but ended up with GDM crashing on boot. :S

09:29	<aarmenaa>	Hi.  I just upgraded to Ubuntu 7.04 from 6.10.  In 6.10 I had the wireless driver for my card blacklist using the line "blacklist rt73usb"  I then used ndiswrapper to provide a driver for the card instead.  In 7.04, it would seem that I need to do something different to get rt73usb to not load, as ndiswrapper claims that it is still loaded (says alternate driver: rt73usb).  Is there something new about blacklisting that would prevent me from blacklisting
09:29	<fantasia>	jordan,I installed that bcm43xx package ,it seems work

09:41	<aarmenaa>	If you're still having trouble after unplugging stuff, try passing acpi=off in the boot loader to the kernel.  ACPI locks up cranky systems too. :)

09:48	<aarmenaa>	ok 2 things then: Ubuntu has Compiz and AIGLIX installed.  Basically, Compiz does what Beryl does and AIGLIX does what XGL does.  You're probably going to have conflicts trying to install Beryl.

09:49	<ExpositionOFEvil>	mjbrooks how?
09:49	<aarmenaa>	Second thing, GPG errors means there's something wrong with the security keys used on the repository.

09:50	<Fujitsu>	Muiske: Oh dear, does it die too? Please file a bug, and downgrade to the old version.
09:50	<Libere>	Muiske: I uninstalled and reinstalled and it works.
09:50	<aarmenaa>	I see.  Your GPG error might be related to the servers being very overloaded, since 7.04 was just released.  If that's the case, then have to wait, unfortunately.  Otherwise, I don't know.
09:51	<Muiske>	Fujitsu: Yep, it dies... what else does? I... really wouldn't downgrade since I don't know what dependencies that would brake.

09:52	<Libere>	Anyone have any idea why I can't get an internet connection with fiesty?
09:52	<Jack313>	even though i highlighted my ext3 partiion
09:52	<Fujitsu>	Jack313: Ensure that you have a partition assigned to /.
09:52	<Fujitsu>	Libere: Did it work in a previous version?
09:52	<Jack313>	how do you assign it to /
09:52	<Flannel>	Jack313: did you format the ext3 partition this install session?
09:52	<Jack313>	no
09:52	<Fujitsu>	Libere: What type of connection is it?
09:53	<sohum>	pwuertz: seems to work ;)
09:53	<Libere>	Cable via netgear router.   Edgy worked, the Live CD i'm using right now works.
09:53	<Flannel>	Jack313: Do that.  Go back a step, delete that partition, and reformat it.  Then mounting it as / should work
09:53	<Libere>	The installed version of Fiesty does not.
09:53	<Fujitsu>	Libere: Using DHCP?
09:53	<Woody_>	people. is there need for a swap partition if i have a 512Mb ram?
09:53	<j00sh>	Hello. I just want to figure out why I couldn't boot up to the Fiesty disk. When I tried to boot up, I got this error message: failed to set xfer mode (err_mask = 0x4)
09:53	<Libere>	Yes, DHCP.  And I can ping localhost.
09:53	<j00sh>	It just kept repeating that.
09:53	<Moofius>	what linux-kernel does ubuntu 7.04 use?
09:53	<aarmenaa>	Woody, yes, you should have a swap partition with 512MB RAM.
09:53	<Moofius>	2,6?
09:53	<Moofius>	2,4?
09:54	<Woody_>	aarmenaa: but i am barely using 40% of that 512
09:54	<Fujitsu>	Moofius: Ubuntu has always used 2.6.
09:54	<Moofius>	ok
09:54	<Fujitsu>	Moofius: Feisty has 2.6.20
09:54	<orbin>	anyone using a broadcom wireless card?
09:54	<Tom47>	Woody_ would you really benefit from not having a swap partition of 750mb???
09:54	<Wymark>	Ok, I try to install Ubuntu and it comes up with this error: Failed to start the X Server. (your graphical interface) It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?
09:54	<aarmenaa>	At the moment, maybe.  It fluxuates a lot.  If you open a lot of tabs in Firefox for example you can easily fill 512MB.
09:55	<Jordan_U>	!anyone | orbin
09:55	<ubotu>	orbin: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
09:55	<Woody_>	ah i see aarmenaa
09:55	<BlackDalek>	I got no sound in YouTube.. someone must know how to fix this? All I get from ubuntuforums.org search is the "FIREFOX_DSP="aoss" fix (which doesn't work now) or 1000+ posts telling me to search the forums or links to threads with the "FIREFOX_DSP="aoss" fix - which doesn't work!!! Did I mention the fix which comes up on the forums search which doesn't work?

09:56	<Wymark>	Ok, I try to install Ubuntu and it comes up with this error: Failed to start the X Server. (your graphical interface) It is likely that it is not set up correctly. Would you like to view the X server output to diagnose the problem?  What can I do to fix this?
09:56	<Fujitsu>	Woody_: No, but Gaim can connect.
09:56	<Libere>	Fujitsu:  Nope, router doesn't see me, and I have no IP address.
09:56	<aarmenaa>	Woody: Gaim can connect to Google talk.
09:56	<MoxJet>	wow top is one nice program =)
09:56	<Woody_>	ah thanks Fujitsu
09:56	<Woody_>	thanks aarmenaa
09:56	<Flannel>	Woody_: google talk is just jabber, so you can use any jabber client
09:56	<Fujitsu>	Libere: In a terminal, run `sudo dhclient eth0', and see if you get an IP address.
09:56	<coldsteal>	Fujitsu: why?
09:56	<Jordan_U>	orbin, If you are using Feisty just sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter to get broadcom cards to work
09:56	<aarmenaa>	I don't know exact instructions, but you use the jabber option.  I think Google had info on their website about it.
09:56	<MoxJet>	and htop has colours! wee =) thanks all
09:56	<Fujitsu>	coldsteal: It has a nice reputation for breaking things.
09:57	<mjbrooks>	coldsteal, it breaks things
09:57	<Fujitsu>	Wymark: What kind of graphics card do you have?
09:57	<Skiptest>	hamp_ : do you have a partition or HD with enough space?
09:57	<aarmenaa>	Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says "(alternate driver: rt73usb)" even though rt73usb is blacklisted.
09:57	<Tom47>	!X11
09:57	<ubotu>	The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type  sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
09:57	<mjbrooks>	coldsteal, you may not know it's broken until you try to upgrade, but it breaks them just the same
09:57	<hamp_>	i had a HD im not shure if i patrtioned it
09:57	<orbin>	Jordan_U: yes it wasn't working OOTB.  is that it?  i followed a lengthy ndiswrapper howto for edgy.
09:57	<Libere>	Fujitsu:  I'll try it, thanks.
09:57	<guiro>	I just upgraded to feisty and cryptsetup stopped working on a LUKS parittion. Is this a known problem?
09:57	<Tom47>	!X11 >	Wymark:
09:57	<Wymark>	Fujitsu: Err, I'm not 100 percent sure, I'm running a fairly old PC. 2002? Let me check real quick..
09:58	<Libere>	What's the *usual* filepath to the networking config file in fiesty?
09:58	<Woody_>	#ubuntu-ar
09:58	<aarmenaa>	Libere: /etc/networking/interfaces
09:58	<Fujitsu>	Libere: /etc/network/interfaces, but Network Manager should handle it automagically.
09:58	<BlackDalek>	yannick: if flash uses alsa... do I need to change FIREFOX_DSP= again.. and to what?
09:59	<aarmenaa>	Yes, changing that file with Network-Manger installed will probably cause unpredictable results.

10:00	<Jordan_U>	orbin, You may have blacklisted the driver when you installed NDIS wrapper so you may have to undo that for bcm43xx to load automatically at boot
10:00	<Skiptest>	hamp_: You're running ubuntu now, do you know enough to check the partititions without destroying them?

10:01	<evader>	Flannel: could you elaborate a bit more
10:01	<MoxJet>	What is the path for the "apache2-default"-folder in the server install?

10:01	<aarmenaa>	Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says "(alternate driver: rt73usb)" even though rt73usb is blacklisted.
10:01	<Tom47>	Woody_: try /j #ubuntu-sa
10:01	<Fujitsu>	MoxJet: Probably in /var/www/
10:01	<MoxJet>	"public html"-root that is
10:02	<MoxJet>	Yes thanks Fujitsu :)
10:02	<Woody_>	lol i know that Tom47, mjbrooks it was just a typo :P
10:02	<evader>	Flannel: so you're saying, to set up an LVM-desktop box, the best bet is alternate install cd?
10:02	<Flannel>	evader: you want the server CD if you want the preinstalled LAMP stack.  Alternate can install a Desktop system, OEM, or CLI-only, but not with LAMP preconfigured
10:02	<stockfisch>	hi folks! is it possible to have two partitions on a usb-hd and to mount them?
10:02	<mjbrooks>	Woody_, you be surprised how many people don't   no offense
10:02	<evader>	Flannel: thanks
10:02	<Flannel>	evader: LVM with GUI is alternate, LAMP preinstall is server

10:03	<Woody_>	guys, what is the best MSN messenger for ubuntu? i want to sort my contact lists to be viewed by their emails, not by their nicknames. how can i do that?
10:03	<orbin>	Jordan_U: i also saw "bcm43xx: Error: Microcode "bcm43xx_microcode5.fw" not available or load failed" at boot ... do i need to worry about this?
10:03	<MoxJet>	Flannel: where should I put my cgi-bin?
10:03	<wickedpuppy>	Woody_, gaim or kopete ... either one
10:03	<PurpZeY>	Can someone tell me how I can change my cursors...The readme indicates to copy the files into /usr/share/icons/ but I am unable to do that
10:03	<Woody_>	wickedpuppy: can i sort them by email?
10:03	<Wymark>	aarmenaa, I'm using an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200.
10:04	<guiro>	I just upgraded to feisty and can't mount an encrypted LUKS partition. cryptsetup succeeds, but mount "wrong fs type". This used to work in edgy. Any idea why this is broken in feisty?
10:04	<aarmenaa>	This is on the computer you set it up on?  Because usually the only time I see this is when I install Ubuntu on a hard disk and then move it to another system.
10:04	<Keyseir>	I start wow up with wine, black at the top and bottom whtie in the center, sound works, any ideas?
10:04	<yannick>	BlackDalek: I don't know, i used automatix to get flash with swftfow in 32bits (i'm using amd64 version)
10:04	<Fujitsu>	Woody_: You can probably turn off the screennames, but not sure how.
10:04	<Flannel>	MoxJet: /usr/lib/cgi-bin by default
10:04	<Jordan_U>	orbin, No, basically that was the driver telling you you didin't have the firmware it needed, now you do :)
10:04	<Fujitsu>	guiro: Which filesystem is it?
10:04	<Woody_>	mmm ok
10:04	<wickedpuppy>	Woody_, don't think so ... can msn do that ?
10:04	<guiro>	ext3
10:04	<Fujitsu>	guiro: I'm using it fine here.
10:04	<Wymark>	Yes, this the computer I'm setting it up on.
10:04	<MoxJet>	wickedpuppy: thanks, nice command!
10:04	<orbin>	Jordan_U: ok, thanks.  attempting to switch to wireless now.
10:04	<PurpZeY>	Where is the /.icons folder located?
10:04	<Woody_>	yes, msn can
10:04	<aarmenaa>	Ok, gimme a sec to figure out the exact command line you need.
10:04	<syberdave>	ugh, why doesn't the fiesty install CD come with ndiswrapper in the cdrom respitory?
10:04	<wickedpuppy>	MoxJet, you got to learn find and grep
10:05	<Woody_>	wickedpuppy: yes msn can
10:05	<MoxJet>	I do use grep :$
10:05	<stockfisch>	can anyone tell me how to partition a hdd which is going to be used under win and linux?
10:05	<guiro>	it definitely doesn't work for me. Should dmsetup status show "crypt" as the target for the encrypted device?
10:05	<Tom47>	Wymark did you check out the X11 reference before?
10:05	<guiro>	it shows "linear" for me
10:05	<Flannel>	syberdave: it does... err, it should.  Desktop CD? or alternate?
10:05	<Wymark>	What is that?
10:05	<PurpZeY>	stockfisch: you can do it using the Ubuntu install...Try to back up if you can
10:05	<stockfisch>	id like two partitions fat32 and ext3
10:05	<Fujitsu>	guiro: I'm just using cryptseutp manually, so I'm not sure.
10:05	<Mena>	!w32codecs
10:05	<ubotu>	Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages, including the win32 codecs: see http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - See also !Codecs
10:05	<wickedpuppy>	Woody_, ah ... my kopete doesn't have this option though ... or i missed it perhaps
10:05	<stockfisch>	for win and a secure container for linux only
10:05	<aarmenaa>	Wymark, run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
10:06	<Wymark>	That will fix it?
10:06	<syberdave>	Flannel: desktop CD. you see, the kernel's driver for my wireless card is broken and i need ndiswrapper. but i can't tell ubuntu to use ndiswrapper instead
10:06	<slackern>	PurpZeY: ~/.icons
10:06	<Fujitsu>	guiro: It is meant to show crypt, as it does here.
10:06	<guiro>	Fujitsu but after cryptsetup you mount the device under /dev/mapper, right?
10:06	<aarmenaa>	It will let you reconfigure the xserver to work with your hardware.  You do need to know a bit about your computer.
10:06	<Woody_>	wickedpuppy: and neither does GAIM :(
10:06	<aarmenaa>	LIke what resolutions, what driver, etc.
10:06	<Wymark>	Ah shite..
10:06	<Fujitsu>	guiro: Yep, what command are you using to open the crypted device?
10:06	<ExpositionOFEvil>	How to upgrade ubuntu?

10:06	<Wymark>	Hmm, ok, so I'll just be doing some research tonight.

10:07	<Fujitsu>	guiro: Try something other than sda6 as the second parameter, it may be a little confused.
10:07	<Bouboule>	Hi, is this the good place to chat about the Fesity upgrade
10:07	<Flannel>	syberdave: hmm.  You're right. It's not there anymore.  Odd.  I imagine it's because some stuff shifted in feisty, and its part of a default package now... or something.
10:07	<arn>	wickedpuppy, nope, i have 1 GB RAM
10:07	<Fujitsu>	Bouboule: Yep.
10:07	<Bouboule>	okay
10:07	<PurpZeY>	slackern: That mean I have to copy the folders manually? b/c I can't find that folder....i am such a noob with this
10:07	<aarmenaa>	It asks for your video driver(which you know - Nvidia), resolutions, refresh rates of your monitor
10:07	<Moofius>	how to do this (live-cd 7.04) "using the "acpi=off" boot option should solve that."
10:07	<slackern>	PurpZeY: But i'm not sure if that folder exists from the start though, mine was created by the art manager software which i use to download icons and such
10:07	<HYPOCRISY>	you tell me ;)
10:07	<Skiptest>	stockfisch: Do you plan to have a swap partition as well?
10:07	<Moofius>	how to set acpi=off ?
10:07	<wickedpuppy>	arn, my 512 mb takes about 1 min to boots
10:07	<aarmenaa>	Go ahead and try and you can always ask in here if you get stuck.
10:07	<syberdave>	Flannel: yeah. i have a quirky HP pavilion laptop :/ i'll just wait until tomorrow when i can get the packages over ethernet
10:08	<PurpZeY>	slackern: is it just in the main file system?
10:08	<Bouboule>	I just upgrade to Feisty Fawn and ...
10:08	<Wymark>	aarmenaa, Which driver will I need to know about? Video card driver?
10:08	<aarmenaa>	Yeah, just the video driver.

10:08	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: no, i only want a 90gb part for win (fat32) and a 30gb part for linux (ext3) but i dont know whether this would work
10:08	<guiro>	Fujitsu that did it!
10:08	<slackern>	PurpZeY: so it would be /home/purpzey/.icons
10:08	<guiro>	thanks :-)

10:09	<guiro>	ok, will do
10:09	<dxdemetriou>	on feisty when I try to unmount an external ext3 disk don't do it, and says that have to write on it. this happens even after reboots
10:09	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: this is going to be a disk for data only, not OS relevant
10:09	<Bouboule>	same as Blubloblu
10:09	<Wymark>	THANK YOU MUCHO. I'll be reconfiguring now.
10:09	<Wymark>	=] 
10:09	<Skiptest>	stockfisch: you can assign a file for swap, but it's a little slower than a partition
10:09	<aarmenaa>	Good luck!
10:09	<Wymark>	I'll be back (possibly)
10:09	<PurpZeY>	slackern: I found it It was a hidden folder
10:09	<slackern>	PurpZeY: Yes the . shows that it's hidden
10:09	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: The . at the start implies that it is hiddefn.
10:09	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: why should i use the swap filesystem instead of ext3?

10:12	<Fujitsu>	malik__: kdesu konqueror
10:12	<Bouboule>	Do I have to edit /etc/rc.local ?
10:12	<Skiptest>	stockfisch: haven't tried it, but I don't see why not
10:12	<dorto>	last time I went through the documentation, all they said about chipsets, thought I got it right and bought two USB wireless net cards and none of them are working :(
10:13	<Beta_M>	it tells me that i don't have MAC HFS during the install
10:13	<Beta_M>	even though i've created that partition
10:13	<malik__>	thanx mate
10:13	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: I think rc.local is a place for you to put startup scripts, but by default it doesnt do anything but exit
10:13	<Bouboule>	I check that now ! wait plz...
10:13	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: no, it is not an installation. Ubuntu is already installed, but i want to kick out my small data disk and put it into an usb frame. thats why
10:13	<eck>	dorto: is there no way you can get something like a mini pci card?
10:13	<Skiptest>	stockfisch: NTFS RW is still experimental
10:13	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: Not any more.
10:13	<aarmenaa>	Exposition, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading has instructions for a bunch of different ways of upgrading.  One of them is for CD upgrades.
10:13	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: ntfs-3g is widely regarded as perfectly stable.
10:13	<dorto>	eck, PCI cards are cumbersome to maintain. I wanted to buy a USB card
10:13	<aarmenaa>	I did once computer using that way, worked great.
10:14	<Skiptest>	Fujitsu: cool
10:14	<Skiptest>	Fujitsu: is it in the kernel, or module-only?
10:14	<dorto>	isn't there a name of a popular USB wireless card for ubuntu, like "get ASUS 167g from amazon and it will give no problems with edgy/fiesty"
10:14	<aarmenaa>	Just make sure you download the ALTERNATE cd.  NOT DESKTOP CD.
10:14	<Bouboule>	Blubloblu I've just checked that and in fact as you said there's nothing than "exit 0", what can I do ???
10:14	<mjbrooks>	mmmm ntfs-3g   now if only no one ever needed it  ;)
10:14	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: I know about that. thats why i want to use fat32(data) and ext3(containing a secure container for private data)
10:14	<Jordan_U>	dorto  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
10:14	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: It isn't in the kernel, as it runs in userspace.
10:15	<eck>	dorto: i'm not sure about usb wireless, but there are a number of good pcmcia wireless cards
10:15	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: I 'm having the same problem buddy!
10:15	<Bouboule>	:~-|
10:15	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, ext3 is not " secure"   you need encryption for that
10:15	<PurpZeY>	Where would I find the XF86Config file?
10:15	<mlissner>	I did the CD download install technique and it didn't work.
10:15	<Skiptest>	Fujitsu: I haven't seen NTFS, except as modules
10:15	<mlissner>	Just FYI.
10:15	<dorto>	eck, pcmcia works only with laptops having pcmcia slots, right?
10:15	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
10:15	<aarmenaa>	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
10:15	<jijutm>	guys any one there. I am on Fiesty beta.. and need to change my display resolution to 1024x768 from 1280x1024.. when I change in the preferences, and apply, the screen goes blank and I cant even shutdown the system.. any leads ?
10:15	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: It uses FUSE, and isn't a kernel module.
10:15	<ExpositionOFEvil>	whats program that edits the repositories?
10:15	<Bouboule>	maybe trying to comment the "exit 0" ??
10:15	<PurpZeY>	Fujitsu: Is there some search function, so I wouldn't have to bother everyone?
10:16	<eck>	dorto: that is correct
10:16	<aarmenaa>	Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says "(alternate driver: rt73usb)" even though rt73usb is blacklisted.
10:16	<ExpositionOFEvil>	or where is the repository source file located?
10:16	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: Just keep bothering us, it's no problem.
10:16	<PurpZeY>	Thanks man
10:16	<stockfisch>	@mjbrooks: right, i want to place an encrypted file in there. since fat32 does not handle large files i am going to use ext3 for it
10:16	<eck>	dorto: there is more than one type though
10:16	<Fujitsu>	ExpositionOFEvil: /etc/apt/sources.list, but you should be able to deal with it in System->Administration->Software Sources.
10:16	<aarmenaa>	I'm not sure how repository editing works, I know there's a text file for it somewhere.
10:16	<Jordan_U>	ExpositionOFEvil, /etc/apt/sources.list
10:16	<ExpositionOFEvil>	nah im in root =P
10:16	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, and this is a usb thumb drive?
10:16	<eck>	dorto: basically all laptops have them -- my laptop doesn't even have a cd drive, but it has a pcmcia slot
10:17	<dorto>	eck: I want the card for a PC not a laptop
10:17	<Fujitsu>	eck: Not many do these days... ExpressCard slots are much more common.
10:17	<ExpositionOFEvil>	thanks
10:17	<stockfisch>	mjbrooks: no, not a thumb drive, a 3.5" usb hdd drive
10:17	<aarmenaa>	Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says "(alternate driver: rt73usb)" even though rt73usb is blacklisted.
10:17	<jijutm>	guys any one there. I am on Fiesty beta.. and need to change my display resolution to 1024x768 from 1280x1024.. when I change in the preferences, and apply, the screen goes blank and I cant even shutdown the system.. any leads ?
10:17	<Jordan_U>	dorto, Then go PCI
10:17	<Fujitsu>	dorto: PCI cards are better.
10:17	<dorto>	anyone knows if ASUS WL 167G is well supported by ubuntu?
10:17	<Tom47>	jijutm usually you can sot it out following the material in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
10:17	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, just Truecrypt the whole thing
10:17	<gb__>	hi guys
10:17	<Fujitsu>	stockfisch: You should probably use LUKS encryption, with ext3 over the top. That's what I do with my /home.
10:17	<PurpZeY>	Fujitsu: It won't allow me to save changes to that file. . .
10:17	<[miles] >	El_Burro: hola
10:17	<jijutm>	tom47: thanks will see to that now
10:17	<dorto>	Jordan_U, USB network cards are so easy to maintain, I am using them on windows, but they don't work on gnu/linux
10:17	<[miles] >	El_Burro: nice nick :-)
10:17	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: Stick sudo in front of the command you're using to edit it.
10:18	<Jordan_U>	!sudo | PurpZeY
10:18	<ubotu>	PurpZeY: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for all information.
10:18	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: thumb drives don't always report the correct filesystem type
10:18	<Fujitsu>	dorto: That's actually a circumstance where the GNU/ is inappropriate :P
10:18	<El_Burro>	[miles] :cheers
10:18	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: Er, why not?
10:18	<[miles] >	the donkey eh
10:18	<[miles] >	:)
10:18	<aarmenaa>	Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says "(alternate driver: rt73usb)" even though rt73usb is blacklisted.
10:18	<stockfisch>	mjbrooks: i need this drive to have it to friends computers. i need the compatibility with windows. will it achieve that?
10:18	<Jordan_U>	dorto, They take more power, take CPU, usually have less functions and aren't as well supported in Linux
10:18	<mjbrooks>	Skiptest, with Truecypt it won't be any filesystem type,  just random data
10:18	<Fujitsu>	aarmenaa: Please wait a little longer between each question.
10:19	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: i've tried commenting  exit 0, booting now
10:19	<aarmenaa>	Sorry
10:19	<[miles] >	El_Burro: you spanish?
10:19	<El_Burro>	nope
10:19	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, Truecrypt is has a nice GUI for windows   a linux gui is on the way
10:19	<freakabcd>	hi all
10:19	<eck>	Fujitsu: and i thought i had a pcmcia slot this whole time...
10:19	<BeBraw>	what could be the reason that feisty install cd gives blank screen (does not respond) after loading a while when i try to install it?
10:20	<[miles] >	El_Burro: im sat here in barcelona lol ... thought with your spanish nick, well, u'd be spanish
10:20	<Bouboule>	Blubloblu... I restart the computer after changing the line ... (suspens)
10:20	<Fujitsu>	eck: It might be PCMCIA, but anything within the last year or two should be ExpressCard.
10:20	<tdn>	What does this error mean: FATAL: fglX11FreeBuffer: firegl_FreeBuffer() failed! I only get 187 hits on Google. Nothing says much.
10:20	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: doesnt help
10:20	<stockfisch>	ill have a look at it
10:20	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: depends, if it's the entire disk or not, a file on a filesystem
10:20	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: same problem
10:20	<ExpositionOFEvil>	yay
10:20	<Bouboule>	mmh
10:20	<freakabcd>	if I upgrade from edgy ->	feisty using the update-manager thingy from the menu, it will still save the packages in /var/cache/apt/... right?
10:20	<stockfisch>	THX@all
10:20	<eck>	Fujitsu: no, i just looked it up and it is definitely expresscard based on the form factor
10:20	<Fujitsu>	ExpositionOFEvil: Does it work?
10:20	<ExpositionOFEvil>	after using 3 cds and 30 hours I finally got a chance to install ubuntu!
10:20	<[miles] >	does anyone know enterprise bookmarks server?
10:20	<Fujitsu>	eck: Yep, it's pretty obvious once you look at it.
10:20	<ExpositionOFEvil>	wohoooo
10:20	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: That's correct.
10:20	<freakabcd>	cos i am going to upgrade my laptop and then use the packages to upgrade my other machine as well
10:20	<mjbrooks>	Skiptest, I've done both a file and a filesystem and accessed them from both windows and linux
10:21	<El_Burro>	[miles] : Barcelona is a great city
10:21	<freakabcd>	And is there any limit on the size of /var/cache/apt/... ?
10:21	<Blubloblu>	Can anybody help with Me & Bouboules problems with a feisty boot haning after Running local booot scripts?
10:21	<Bouboule>	I'v checked the forum http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2386228
10:21	<ardchoille>	I am getting this returned from chkrootkit: Searching for OBSD rk v1... /usr/lib/security  /usr/lib/security/classpath.security
10:21	<ardchoille>	Anyone getting that?
10:21	<Jordan_U>	freakabcd, Yes, but that doesn't mean you will be able to revert to the previous packages
10:21	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: haven't tried TC in Linux
10:21	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: you could download the 7.04 alternate CD, and use that. That's more reliable.
10:21	<[miles] >	El_Burro: aye.. I prefer Valencia my self...
10:21	<freakabcd>	cos i don;t want it to delete packages cos it went over some quota or something
10:21	<[miles] >	El_Burro: but it beats the UK ;)
10:21	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: Not unless you run out of disk space.
10:21	<freakabcd>	Jordan_U, previous packages?
10:21	<PurpZeY>	How do I save and edit from sudo edit ?
10:21	<freakabcd>	who cares about them
10:21	<ExpositionOFEvil>	bye
10:21	<mjbrooks>	Skiptest, it works,   no friendly gui, but it works
10:21	<ExpositionOFEvil>	=)
10:21	<dorto>	fujitsu, i was talking about distributions - windows and gnu/linux as I see them. can't care less if actually the underlying windows kernel and linux have to support the cards :)
10:21	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: It won't delete stuff unless you tell it to.
10:21	<freakabcd>	i'm going edgy ->	feisty
10:21	<PurpZeY>	rather...save and quit
10:21	<Bouboule>	yes, it does nothing !
10:21	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: prefer GNU CFSD
10:22	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: what was the command you ran?
10:22	<Bouboule>	freakabcd : NOOOOOOO !!!!
10:22	<slackern>	oops 160gb seeded since last night, wonder how isp's bandwidth looks after this ubuntu release :)
10:22	<El_Burro>	[miles]  almost anywhere beats the UK at the mo
10:22	<[miles] >	aye
10:22	<freakabcd>	Bouboule, ??
10:22	<Jordan_U>	freakabcd, I just wanted to be sure that you didn't thik that because the packages were there that you could go back to Edgy after the upgrade :)
10:22	<freakabcd>	what
10:22	<freakabcd>	no way.
10:22	<PurpZeY>	Fujistu: sudoedit ...xorg.conf added one line and now I want to save and quit
10:22	<PurpZeY>	or save and close it
10:22	<freakabcd>	i'm going to become feisty :p
10:22	<Bouboule>	freakabcd : I done that and no restart of my pc
10:22	<aarmenaa>	Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says "(alternate driver: rt73usb)" even though rt73usb is blacklisted.
10:22	<Helmi>	anyone here knows how to fix the raid issue on upgrading?
10:22	<orbin>	Jordan_U: no luck.  nm-applet just keeps spinning.  i turned off wpa just incase i got the passphrase wrong
10:22	<freakabcd>	Bouboule, really?
10:22	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: Try pressing Ctrl+X
10:22	<[miles] >	so I see from the TV... El_Burro I left years ago ... but the other week I thought I'd put Sky TV in... urrghh, I think I'll move the dish to another satalite :-)
10:23	<freakabcd>	Bouboule, and how did you fix it?
10:23	<Bouboule>	freakabcd : lucky guy !
10:23	<Fujitsu>	Helmi: `the raid issue'?
10:23	<freakabcd>	lol
10:23	<PurpZeY>	Fujitsu: I just didn't know if it would save my changes. . .
10:23	<PurpZeY>	Ok.
10:23	<orbin>	Jordan_U: iwlist scan shows the network.  i just can't seem to connect to it.
10:23	<Bouboule>	no fix, just embarrassing now :(
10:23	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: It will ask you.
10:23	<freakabcd>	Bouboule, please tell me yours wasn;t a dell 710m laptop
10:23	<Helmi>	sorry, like described here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=415401

10:28	<PurpZeY>	Anyone know why a particular them would load, show up on the login and then bring me to human once I am logged in?
10:28	<Fujitsu>	underwatercow: Run smbpasswd in a terminal, and use the password you set there.
10:28	<p-Lukemob>	Please copy/paste. I got disconnected. :(
10:28	<PurpZeY>	theme*
10:29	<frandavid100>	but it looks like a hardware problem, since it stopped working after I plugged a video card last night
10:29	<underwatercow>	Fujitsu: is there no way to disable the password altogether?

10:39	<underwatercow>	why would you format a flash drive as ntfs?

10:39	<Niek>	ringo: it is always good to have it, when there's some kind of bug, your computer will crash 'cause it hasn't enough memory
10:39	<ceil420>	is it possible to use ./configure switches with apt-get? i.e. "sudo apt-get install conky --enable=audacious"
10:39	<underwatercow>	lol
10:39	<arooni>	is it better to wait on upgrading to fesity?

10:39	<rototo>	Hello there
10:39	<ringo>	Niek: i know, but the question was -need- and no you dont always need.  for instance if you have 1gig of ram and a 1gig swap, thast the same as having 2 gig of ram
10:39	<underwatercow>	ringo: not quite

10:40	<crdlb>	ceil420, no that wouldn't work because you're installing a version that has already been compiled when you use apt-get

10:40	<underwatercow>	SKiptest: i know that there are ways, but none were convenient or built in
10:41	<Niek>	AnObfuscator: mv ?
10:41	<PurpZeY>	Is there something I have to do to get a theme to load? I can see the theme at the login screen, but once I actually get into Gnome, I get the standard Gnome theme.
10:41	<darkos>	HOla
10:41	<underwatercow>	Skiptest: what kernel?
10:41	<blocky>	hey guys does anyone know what it means when I get a message about restricted drivers for the HAL as soon as i login to gdm
10:41	<Blubloblu>	freakabcd :ok, i see stuff i think is my hardware being recognized
10:41	<blocky>	and then the desktop never loads
10:41	<blocky>	i just reinstalled fiesty
10:41	<eck>	ceil420: it is simple to just compile an application and prefix it to your home directory though
10:41	<AnObfuscator>	Niek: I don't need to move the folder, I need gdm to see folder /media/sda4/home as home, not /meda/sda4/home as home (which doesn't exist) :P
10:41	<noob_>	oh also i am using fiesty
10:41	<underwatercow>	blocky: it means you are using restricted drivers, namely ones that are probably close source
10:42	<Skiptest>	underwatercow: I doubt a kernel would boot on top of an NTFS  filesystem, like the old umsdos days of yore...
10:42	<rambo3>	PurpZeY, what theme
10:42	<calculator>	underwatercow: i have gotten magiciso
10:42	<calculator>	underwatercow: have you used it?
10:42	<ceil420>	eck, i'm getting an error when i try ./configure
10:42	<underwatercow>	calculator: I have, but it's been a while
10:42	<Niek>	Ahh, erm. and it have to be in a Terminal?
10:42	<blocky>	underwatercow, why doesn't the desktop load...
10:42	<PurpZeY>	rambo: Blue Swirl
10:42	<AnObfuscator>	Niek: because GDM won't load, even in failsafe
10:42	<eck>	ceil420: wht package are you trying to build?
10:42	<noob_>	or does anybody know of a program that has radio streams
10:42	<underwatercow>	blocky: I'm sorry?
10:42	<Niek>	Ubuntu: System ->	Administration ->	Users and Groups ;)
10:42	<blocky>	well i know what restricted, non free drivers are
10:42	<AnObfuscator>	Niek: and I haven't had time to enable root. haha, yeah, thanks. ;)
10:42	<rambo3>	PurpZeY, mo i mean gl2.0 gdm or usplash
10:42	<ceil420>	eck, conky, with audacious support
10:42	<calculator>	i don't know whether I should make it a bootable image file (http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-makeiso.htm), or create an ISO image file (http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-create-iso-image-file.htm). which, please?
10:42	<underwatercow>	blocky: your desktop doesn't load?
10:43	<blocky>	i was wondering if that was relevant, as its the last thing i see before the desktop doesn't load...
10:43	<Bouboule>	Blubloblu : got something ???
10:43	<dani>	i wan to learn hardcore programming in c/c++, python, java . don't know of any tools in linux os's beside kdevelop in kubuntu any recommendations
10:43	<blocky>	nope
10:43	<eck>	ceil420: sudo apt-get build-dep conky
10:43	<Blubloblu>	bouboule: no, you?
10:43	<ceil420>	eck, but even just ./configure without anything gives me an error
10:43	<eck>	ceil420: and grab the audacious-dev package as well
10:43	<PurpZeY>	rambo3: I got it from gnome-look it was under GDM
10:43	<eck>	ceil420: then you will be able to configure it fine
10:43	<ceil420>	eck, build-dep? what's that do?
10:43	<Bouboule>	not yet, it arrives I smell that !!!
10:43	<blocky>	the gnome load screen shows
10:43	<Bouboule>	lol
10:43	<underwatercow>	calculator: doesn't it let you burn from a preexisting iso?
10:43	<rellik>	there's something wrong with my sound since the update..  in my amarok playlist, every other song is silent.  The equalizer bars dance around, as if it were playing, but thereis no sound..  makes it seem like ubuntu isn't correctly handling sound-card sharing, so when the old song is playing, the new one can't fade in
10:43	<blocky>	but the desktop never shows
10:43	<eck>	ceil420: it grabs the build dependencies :-)
10:43	<blocky>	no right click, no task bar
10:43	<noob_>	does audacious have radio streams on it?????
10:43	<blocky>	no icons etc
10:43	<PurpZeY>	rambo3: I installed it using gdsetup...That's what the read, me said.
10:43	<calculator>	underwatercow: i don't understand your quesntion
10:43	<ringo>	dani:  use a simple text editor like xemacs. you dont need the bells and whistles of Kdevelop untli you know what you are doing
10:44	<PurpZeY>	readme*

10:44	<dani>	ringo k thx
10:44	<ceil420>	eck, how will that let me do the equivalent of "./configure --enable=audacious"?
10:44	<blocky>	any ideas?
10:44	<underwatercow>	calculator: you have already downloaded the ISO for ubuntu, right?
10:44	<rambo3>	PurpZeY, try changing it again in gdmsetup
10:44	<eck>	ceil420: you still need to compile it yourself, but this way you will have all the dev headers so the configure script won't fail
10:44	<calculator>	underwatercow: yes, i have
10:44	<PurpZeY>	rambo3: am I downloading the wrong type of themes?
10:44	<dani>	ringo u know any simple open source application that i can read the code tinker around with
10:44	<ceil420>	E: You must put some 'source' URIs in your sources.list
10:44	<ringo>	dani: and stay away from "teach yourself X in Y amount of days" books.
10:44	<ceil420>	:x
10:44	<underwatercow>	calculator: look for an option in magicISO to burn an image to disc
10:45	<ringo>	dani: there is no quick path to programming
10:45	<calculator>	and i want to put the iso onto a CD-R disc, so that when I put that disc into another computer, it will work.
10:45	<eck>	ceil420: you need deb-src lines in your sources.list
10:45	<rambo3>	PurpZeY, no if you only want login theme yo download gdm theme. if you want gnome theme you download gtk2.0 theme
10:45	<underwatercow>	calculator: I don't remember if there are size restrictions on burning or not though
10:45	<calculator>	"burn CD/DVD with ISO"? is that it?
10:45	<PurpZeY>	Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
10:45	<PurpZeY>	That explains it.
10:45	<PurpZeY>	I am just an idiot.

10:50	<SubMOA>	is says "proper configuration not found"

10:50	<blocky>	okay im pretty sure ath_hal is a wifi driver
10:50	<underwatercow>	Skiptest: what?
10:51	<blocky>	could the prevention of its loading somehow prevent gnome from starting properly
10:51	<SubMOA>	how do i fix firestarter?
10:51	<underwatercow>	calculator: just click the option to burn from iso. I think that should work fine.
10:51	<eternaljoy>	is there any way of converting dvr-ms files to mpeg?
10:51	<ceil420>	oh snap, i think it worked
10:51	<ceil420>	:D
10:52	<Toma->	eternaljoy: id say ffmpeg could do it, but dont hold your breath
10:52	<dystopianray>	eternaljoy: ffmpeg should be able to do it
10:52	<eternaljoy>	Toma-: it cant
10:52	<eternaljoy>	ffmpeg dolesnt understand dvr-ms
10:52	<SubMOA>	I'm trying to upgrade stuff through synaptic but it keeps saying it fails do to firestarter not working.  Should I just restart?  What could cause it to "break"?
10:52	<freakabcd>	eternaljoy, can you play the file with mplayer?
10:52	<Skiptest>	underwatercow: maybe if the livecd iso were on the HD, it might be possible to change root to it, then eject the livecd... (it's read-only)
10:53	<Toma->	eternaljoy: ok. have you checked with the ffmpeg site? the ubuntu version o0f ffmpeg is terrible
10:53	<eternaljoy>	freakabcd: of course
10:53	<blocky>	lol
10:53	<ceil420>	eck, thanks much ^^
10:53	<blocky>	okay
10:53	<freakabcd>	if you can do that, sure as hell mencoder can re-encode it to something else
10:53	<eternaljoy>	Toma-: where is websote?
10:53	<blocky>	we discovered the issue was related to turning on the WIFI
10:53	<calculator>	underwatercow: there is a button that says "burn cd/dvid with ISO", but no button that says "burn cd/dvd from ISO".
10:53	<blocky>	lol
10:53	<Toma->	eternaljoy: use mencoder
10:53	<blocky>	cheers guys
10:53	<underwatercow>	calculator: try that one
10:53	<eternaljoy>	Toma-: mencodeer supports dvr-ms????????
10:54	<SubMOA>	how do I fix firestarter?
10:54	<freakabcd>	eternaljoy, is that a serious question?
10:54	<mjbrooks>	calculator, sounds to me like it's the same thing
10:54	<Toma->	eternaljoy: if mplayer can play dvr-ms, then mencoder can convert it.
10:54	<underwatercow>	Skiptest: He's trying to burn from XP so he CAN live boot
10:54	<freakabcd>	eternaljoy, if mplayer can play it, mencoder can re-encode it!
10:54	<Toma->	:>

10:56	<SubMOA>	underwatercow, you (and the other people I typed) told me "no, xp can't burn iso" so I said  "oOo"
10:56	<Libere>	Upgraded from Edgy to Fiesty.  Fiesty has no net connection, can ping the local host but can't get anything else, grub lists 2.6.20-15 and 2.6.17-11.... if I try to boot into 2.6.17-11 the OS never loads, but the router sees me as connected.  Tried changing the networking config to match what the Live Cd's said when connected, but everytime I open network it re-screws it up.  Any ideas?
10:56	<spankstar-ubuntu>	im running live rightr now
10:56	<underwatercow>	SubMOA: gotcha... lol

10:59	<Fujitsu>	Hm, how useless...
10:59	<Bouboule>	Libere : that's right that !!!!!! (nope for me) :~-(

11:00	<SubMOA>	calculator, I haven't used it... but it seems to be popular, and it's free.  I imagine some kind of interface comes up and you can drag and drop or select the file somehow and wam-bam you got a perfect copy :O)
11:00	<CheshireViking>	hi, anybody able to help me get nvidia-legacy working at decent resolution after fiesty upgrade? before upgrade I had 1600x1200, after upgrade, i can only get 800x600, i've tried uninstalling nvidia, reinstalling through repo's, I've used Envy, to remove & install
11:00	<_filippo_>	Fujitsu: i'll go to -motu then..

11:02	<ringo>	DapperDave: Only 6.10 can upgrade to 7.04
11:02	<Libere>	Anyone have any idea why fiesty refuses to give me an internet connection?
11:02	<sanityx>	wow
11:02	<mjbrooks>	DapperDave, you have to go through 6.10
11:03	<underwatercow>	Libere: doesn't like you?

11:05	<matason>	Any ideas where the kernel source is located on Ubuntu 6.06 please?
11:05	<mjbrooks>	redux_, try removing nvidia-glx and reinstalling it
11:05	<underwatercow>	Libere: you can always ping the local host

11:06	<sanityx>	dystopianray, good point
11:06	<_4strO>	Horscht: in kamix the green led active/desactive the sound
11:06	<underwatercow>	is there a linux utility to convert real media files to a normal extension? lol
11:06	<sanityx>	Has anything been moved to upstart or is it still just executing the init scripts?

11:07	<Libere>	No I cannot ping the router.  The router does not see me at all, and vice versa.  And I have no idea if the network card has the proper driver.
11:07	<calculator>	SubMOA: i did the burning, but i don't see anything in the cd via file explorer

11:07	<fungostar>	anyone can help me with the installation on a PlayStation3 ???
11:07	<SubMOA>	perhaps they are hidden, calculator   Did it sound like it was burning?

11:07	<cherva_>	anyone solved the api mishmash after installing the nvidia drivers on 7.04 ?

11:08	<SubMOA>	calculator, check your ISO... did you do an MD5 check?
11:08	<dthacker>	Libere: open a terminal.  sudo ifconfig.  What does the line starting with inet addr say ?
11:08	<fungostar>	sanityx not really... the installer hangs at 15%
11:08	<underwatercow>	Libere: lol... rephrase... you SHOULD always be able to
11:08	<calculator>	SubMOA: yes, hashes match
11:08	<mjbrooks>	fungostar, that sounds fairly specialist to find support for here
11:08	<yellow_chicken>	anyone know a quick way to fix sound on 7.04?
11:08	<Libere>	dthacker: get back to you on that in 5.

11:09	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: I think I have a solution
11:09	<underwatercow>	I want a flux capicator
11:09	<sanityx>	thats funny brooks
11:09	<calculator>	SubMOA: it took only 7 secondes
11:09	<fungostar>	foxiness thanks, that is related to the previous version
11:09	<matason>	How do I find my kernel-source?
11:09	<tankcat>	sanityx, uhh.... how are celerons recently? (I haven't owned a celeron in years)
11:09	<exs>	hi guys, is there any easy-to-use linux app that allows me to completely clone my laptops hard drive, so that - if it goes wrong, I am able to put it all back, *exactly* how it was before? .. I have a couple of USB hard drive and I'm hoping to be able to do this (I'm going to upgrade to feisty)
11:09	<_4strO>	Horscht: Kmiw sorry :p
11:09	<calculator>	it should have taken several dozen minutes
11:09	<_4strO>	Kmox
11:09	<mjbrooks>	fungostar, there must be a linux-ports channel or something
11:09	<SubMOA>	calculator, yea... that can't be right.
11:09	<_4strO>	Kmix
11:10	<_4strO>	...
11:10	<sanityx>	tankcat, theyre budget cpus
11:10	<sanityx>	not bad, not great
11:10	<ringo>	exs: yes its called dd
11:10	<sanityx>	very little cache
11:10	<dystopianray>	exs: dd
11:10	<Horscht>	_4strO: bash: kmiw: command not found
11:10	<tankcat>	hmmm...
11:10	<sanityx>	So, strangely enough I had to downgrade my bios to install feisty
11:10	<exs>	ringo:  dystopianray and where do I find the homepage for DD?
11:10	<ringo>	exs:  dd if=/dev/sourcedevice of=/dev/destdevice  DO NOT SWITCH THESE. make sure you got input and output setup right
11:10	<_4strO>	Horscht: kmix :p
11:10	<cherva_>	how to install the kernel source in console mode ?
11:10	<fungostar>	mjbrooks looking on the ubuntu IRC channel list, this is the most appropriate :(
11:11	<dystopianray>	exs: it's already installed, it's a standard tool, $ man dd
11:11	<josephus_>	hi.  what does it mean when an onboard NIC doesn't show up with lshw?
11:11	<ringo>	exs: uh maybe man dd will tell you
11:11	<Horscht>	gotta install it first
11:11	<SubMOA>	calculator, well... if you just want to burn one real quick... nero has a free trial.  Not sure if ISO burn is supported on their trial, but I would think it would be.  URL: http://www.nero.com/nero7/eng/nero7-demo.php
11:11	<exs>	dystopianray:  ringo hmm, I think you're over judging my intelligence... I don't like command line stuff. The more I can avoid it the better.
11:11	<sluimers>	how do I set java home? and would "echo $JAVA_HOME" prove that it's working?
11:11	<SubMOA>	calculator, see? Window's sucks, huh?
11:11	<mjbrooks>	fungostar, yeah, for computers.... thats more like an embedded device
11:11	<SubMOA>	;O)
11:11	<dystopianray>	exs: you're not going to find anything simpler than dd
11:12	<calculator>	SubMOA: or maybe just the program that i used
11:12	<earth2>	What is a good email program that will allow me to send and receive email strictly from the terminal?
11:12	<dthacker>	earth2: mutt
11:12	<dystopianray>	exs: if you can't work out dd then I doubt you can work out an equivalent gui, if such a thing exists
11:12	<calculator>	SubMOA: it's 178 MB
11:12	<dxdemetriou>	I have exactly this problem for unmounting external disks: http://www.mail-archive.com/ubuntu-bugs@lists.ubuntu.com/msg286678.html
11:12	<exs>	dystopianray:  uhm, so you're saying linux has no GUI based partition backup tool?
11:12	<earth2>	thanks
11:12	<fungostar>	mjbrooks, right.. but for ubuntu specific help, there is nothing else :)
11:12	<ringo>	exs: yeah either dd or spend some cash for partition magic
11:12	<mjbrooks>	fungostar, maybe something like #ps3linux
11:12	<redux_>	mjbrooks: ok, uninstalled glx and installed new glx
11:12	<dystopianray>	exs: there likely is, but i've never looked for one
11:12	<exs>	ringo:  I have partition magic, it's not for linux
11:12	<dystopianray>	exs: $ sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=backup
11:12	<tankcat>	would XFCE run on a celeron?
11:12	<ringo>	exs: wow thats lame.  i dunno then
11:13	<mjbrooks>	redux_, and?
11:13	<SubMOA>	calculator, ohh.. well... maybe you could start downloading it and look for an alternative... that way, if 20-30 minutes later you don't have a good solution, you have that one on standby... btw, it appears it includes ISO capabilitty
11:13	<Liber>	Was it inet addr or inet6 addr that you wanted?
11:13	<redux_>	works great, but if i install beryl, is it going to mess things up again?
11:13	<exs>	dystopianray:  ok ok... so, if I do successfully backup my linux whole HD to my USB HD, how do i put it back if it goes wrong? (as in, command etc)
11:13	<ringo>	tankcat: I got XFce running fast on a p3 500Mhz w/ 128MB of ram
11:13	<ringo>	tankcat: So yes
11:13	<mjbrooks>	redux_, it shouldn't
11:13	<SubMOA>	I sure would like to know why that ISO Recorder didn't work. calculator
11:13	<Xenguy>	tankcat: I expect so; I'm interested in trying fluxbox also
11:14	<dystopianray>	exs: $ sudo if=backup of=/dev/sda
11:14	<dthacker>	Liber: if you are talking to me, put my name at the start of your response, please
11:14	<mjbrooks>	redux_, but in the off chance it does... you now know what to do  ;)
11:14	<exs>	dystopianray:  does DD have documentation?
11:14	<dystopianray>	exs: man dd
11:14	<Liber>	dthacker: sorry, I forgot it :-p
11:14	<redux_>	mjbrooks: thanks a bunch!
11:14	<dthacker>	Liber: inet addr
11:14	<mjbrooks>	redux_, have fun
11:14	<ringo>	exs: with a normal setup your dd command will actually be this    sudo if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb       That is if your HDD is SATA and your USB is the only usb device plugged into your computer at the time
11:14	<calculator>	SubMOA: i tried burning again, and it gave me an error message/number
11:14	<dystopianray>	exs: you can combine it with gzip to compress the images too
11:14	<HyperJoshBeat>	Hi everyone..
11:14	<Liber>	dthacker: 127.0.0.1
11:14	<HyperJoshBeat>	is good to be back from the grave
11:14	<SubMOA>	calculator, hmm...
11:15	<ringo>	exs: if your HDD is PATA, then replace /dev/sda with /dev/hda
11:15	<HyperJoshBeat>	LTS is a freeworld.
11:15	<exs>	ringo:  I have a normal laptop harddrive, I think it's under HDA1. not sda
11:15	<sanityx>	is it possible to grow an ext3 volume?
11:15	<dystopianray>	ringo: I think he wants to make a backup image, not completely mirror a drive
11:15	<ringo>	exs: ok well to copy everything including boot sector do hda and not hda1
11:15	<dthacker>	Liber: that's for l0, right
11:15	<calamari>	what's the difference between nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-new?
11:15	<Liber>	dthacker: correct
11:15	<ringo>	exs: if you dont want to mirror then just ignore me
11:16	<exs>	ringo:  ok
11:16	<SubMOA>	MUAHA!: http://www.cdburnerxp.se/features.php give that a go!
11:16	<HyperJoshBeat>	any1 tried workin on a webcam on Ubuntu
11:16	<calculator>	SubMOA: i'm getting nero now. under 5 minutes
11:16	<HyperJoshBeat>	Please help
11:16	<mjbrooks>	calamari, nvidia-glx-new is  er..  new?
11:16	<dthacker>	Liber: do you have anything showing for eth0 or eth1?
11:16	<calamari>	mjbrooks: yeah.. hehe it doesn't help much does it? :)
11:16	<exs>	ringo:  wait... is this going to put *1* nice file on my USB harddrive?..
11:17	<ringo>	exs: dd will make your USB drive look exactly the same as your internal
11:17	<Liber>	dthacker:  I check that with... sudo eth0 and eth1 in terminal?  (sorry, I'm still sorta nooby.)
11:17	<Skiptest>	calculator: maybe turn off anti-virus, search, etc...
11:17	<mjbrooks>	calamari, if I had to guess it's for the latest greatest, boil your coffee from the heat cards
11:17	<SubMOA>	calculator, that's good... if you still plan to use XP after 15 days, that last link might be beneficial
11:17	<MrWhammy>	hello all, could someone tell me if there is an installation guide for a newbie to Feisty Fawn (especially the partition thing, I don't want to loose my ntfs data partition)
11:17	<exs>	ringo:  ok, so I have to have formatted the USB external hd then first
11:17	<ringo>	exs: so you will see the directory structure and what not
11:17	<dystopianray>	exs: do you want to backup the whole drive or just one partition?
11:17	<exs>	dystopianray:  I don't really mind... I have a blank hard drive.
11:17	<ringo>	exs: not with dd.  dd will copy the partition structure of your interna drive. its a bit for bit cocpy
11:18	<dystopianray>	exs: what exactly do you want to backup?
11:18	<SubMOA>	soooo... does anybody know how to fix firestarter with an error like this: "A proper configuration for Firestarter was not found..."
11:18	<dthacker>	Liber: we were all new once :)  no you should see a set of info for eth0 and another for l0
11:18	<Cosmo_>	since installing 7.04 I now have no sound, it was working fine with my creative labs audigy in 6.10

11:18	<Liber>	dthacker:  From the sudo ifconfig?  Nope.  Nothing there.

11:19	<ringo>	exs:  my 80 gig took a couple hours at least

11:19	<iMilad>	Hello everybody, I installed my old hard drive and all of it's partitions have been detected and mounted by Ubuntu. But does anybody know how can i become partitions owner? and have full access over them?
11:19	<ringo>	exs: dd shows no progress output by default, so it may look stalled but your HDD lights will be blinking
11:19	<exs>	ringo:  it's ok, i have about 5 hours to spare
11:19	<dystopianray>	exs: mount the new drive, cd into it, $ sudo if=/dev/hda of=hdabackup bs=1M
11:19	<MrWhammy>	ubotu:thanks
11:19	<ubotu>	You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
11:19	<lnxmomo>	hi, can anyone tell me how i can block the rt2500usb kernal module so i can use ndiswrapper instead?

11:21	<xreye>	How do I get wpa to work with feisty? It won't show up on my network settings window
11:21	<Horscht>	well, sound worked fine in Kubuntu 7.04 _4strO. But I found KDE confusing, plus it wouldn' recognize my external HD
11:21	<iMilad>	calamari: and one of the partitions is not even readable
11:21	<dthacker>	what's the gnome path to configure networks cards?
11:21	<calamari>	iMilad: ahh, I see.. I'm assuming you can write files as root
11:21	<Liber>	dthacker:  I don't suppose there's a way to rollback to the previous version of ubuntu?
11:21	<calamari>	iMilad: is that correct?

11:22	<PirateHead>	crimsun: did you work anything out yesterday? I'm not trying to be pushy, just saying hi really.
11:22	<[Jonne] >	hi have a question about Opera: update-manager says there's a new version of Opera, but i can't check the box to install it. Why is that?
11:22	<mjbrooks>	!nvidia >	ahmed
11:22	<ahmed>	yes
11:22	<SubMOA>	firerstarter: "A proper configuration file not found..." what to do? I don't think synaptic works with that broken so I can't reload it!
11:22	<dthacker>	Liber: don't panic.  can you get to the hardware config menu on gnome?
11:22	<_4strO>	Horscht: for your external HD, is it better with Gnome ?
11:22	<ahmed>	nvidia legacy driver
11:22	<calculator>	SubMOA:  i just realized. the iso somehow became 50kbs
11:23	<PirateHead>	[Jonne] : that happened to me with Wine a few weeks ago, and the problem just went away after a few days.
11:23	<mjbrooks>	hypnox, that card may have been moved to the legacy package
11:23	<SubMOA>	calculator, oOo.
11:23	<[Jonne] >	ok
11:23	<Ayabara>	Has anyone made the Cisco vpn client work in feisty?

11:23	<[Jonne] >	i'll upgrade to feisty anyway, this afternoon, so it might be fixed by then anyway
11:23	<_4strO>	han !
11:23	<SubMOA>	calculator, is it stillw here you originally had it?  Or did you move the file?
11:23	<ahmed>	hey
11:24	<dthacker>	Liber: sorry, I don't use gnome much.  Look for system settings and a way to configure the network
11:24	<calamari>	iMilad: sudo -i
11:24	<mjbrooks>	ahmed, hey if for horses who can't spell
11:24	<seravitae>	ok, so edgy is asking me to update to feisty. what's involved in the update? i have a custom kernel and i *cannot* have it touched by the upgrade.
11:24	<Huffalump>	I need help getting the nvidia driver to work under Feisty, please.  It is my 3rd day working on this problem and, so far, nothing has worked.  Previously it was a wfb problem, but I believe that is solved.  Currently, the problem seems to be with an API mismatch.
11:24	<calculator>	SubMOA: i think when i was playing around with iso burning programs (i.e. magicISO), it changed the iso file
11:24	<ahmed>	????????
11:24	<calamari>	iMilad: if that works okay, then it can be set up to allow the normal user to have access as well (this is done in /etc/fstab)
11:24	<PirateHead>	*is* there a way to rollback to the previous version of Ubuntu? I would really like to at this point.
11:25	<yannick>	Huffalump: use nv diver instead
11:25	<seravitae>	PirateHead: from feisty to edge?
11:25	<iMilad>	calamari: tx, it works
11:25	<seravitae>	edgy*
11:25	<PirateHead>	seravitae: Right.
11:25	<Huffalump>	yannick, that is my current work around.  However, I want to use nvidia.
11:25	<seravitae>	well, ive been here for about 1 minute and so far 3 people have feisty problems. i'm not updating.
11:25	<yannick>	Huffalump: what is the card name?
11:26	<Huffalump>	seravitae, if your current install works, just wait.
11:26	<mjbrooks>	Huffalump, for API mismatch remove the nvidia-glx package then reinstall it
11:26	<Liber>	dthacker: Yeah, network doesn't work.  I tried changing the config file to match the network config file that displays when the LiveCD is running, since the Live Cd works... but everytime I open network it rewrites it again.  The wierd thing is that GRUB lists the previous version, but doesn't load it when selected.  However, as soon as it IS selected, the PC connects to the router.  So I'm making the Logical (to me) assumption that it's a conflict
11:26	<Liber>	somewhere in the configuration.
11:26	<seravitae>	my current install is great, so im not touching it.
11:26	<SmSpillaz>	Is the 7.04 Desktop DVD a live DVD?
11:26	<iMilad>	calamari: one more question, I want to delete all of partitions in this old hard drive and create new ones, which file system do u suggest?
11:26	<Huffalump>	jbrooks, I've done that 3 or 4 times, but I am not opposed to trying it yet again.
11:26	<Liber>	dthacker:  I mean, network opens, but it doesn't configure a connection succesfully.
11:26	<Huffalump>	yannick, GeForce FX 5600 (tried with both nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-new which should work)
11:26	<mev>	hello?
11:27	<calamari>	iMilad: well, it really depends on what you plan to use the drive for
11:27	<Horscht>	does someone have a (compiled) driver for a Realtek AC97 sound card
11:27	<SmSpillaz>	Is the 7.04 Desktop DVD a live DVD?
11:27	<mev>	why dont i see the users in the channel? using xchat
11:27	<mjbrooks>	why is everyone referring to me a jbrooks today??
11:27	<mjbrooks>	as*
11:27	<cherva_>	how to install the 2.6.20 kernel source trought apt-get ? I tryed apt-get install linux-source-2.6.20 but the nvidia driver still doesn't like it and says that no kernel source is found .
11:27	<Huffalump>	mjbookrs because it was an illegal character when highlighted for some reason
11:27	<mjbrooks>	hmm
11:27	<Huffalump>	mjbrooks, but when you dont mention my name, THEN i see the m
11:28	<dthacker>	Liber: so you update the nic settings, then apply, and they don't save?
11:28	<xreye>	Why don't I see any option for wpa when I go to System-->Administration-->Network?
11:28	<xreye>	(on feisty)
11:28	<mjbrooks>	Huffalump, interesting   because it's been happening all day today   but it has never happened before
11:28	<calamari>	cherva_: usually you don't need to install the nvidia driver manually.
11:28	<Huffalump>	mjbrooks, when highlighted on XChat, your m becomes a square
11:29	<sanityx>	God I hate ATI.
11:29	<rushdy>	hi, im having problems setting my scaling governor on boot with feisty. editing rc.local or the powernowd init script dont seem to do anything on boot, but work if i run them afterward?
11:29	<Huffalump>	If I copy/paste, then it's m.  If you're not highlighted, it's m.  Weird!
11:29	<sanityx>	I can't enable desktop effects because ati drivers dont support composite extensions.
11:29	<mjbrooks>	Huffalump, no biggie, I just keep missing things people say to me  ;)
11:29	<dxdemetriou>	if I modify the file 10-storage-policy.fdi as reported in forun from true to false is safe?
11:30	<Liber>	dthacker:  it's set for auto dhcp.. it will say changing interface configuration, but then nothing happens .

11:31	<tankcat>	can anyone recommend linux-friendly hardware vendors? cheap desktops in particular
11:31	<cherva_>	ok i wont get help here thats for sure :( all day i'm trying to fix my updated 7.04 machine. all day i'm posting here for help an nothing  I cant install nvidia drivers on 7.04 pls help
11:31	<ugresia>	luubuntu?
11:31	<Huffalump>	How can I solve an API mismatch?  I had understood previously that I would need to remove all linux-restricted-* modules (and related bits) as well as all nvidia-* modules.  Make sure xorg.conf was set to nv.  Reboot.  Install nvidia-glx and linux-restricted*, change xorg.conf to nvidia, reboot.  But it gives an API mismatch after several different attempts at this.
11:31	<ugresia>	google

11:33	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

11:33	<foug>	ringo: they are the only ones that lag, no other video i have does it
11:33	<Liber>	dthacker: is there a way to rollback?  I think it's just that the update got botched.
11:33	<Huffalump>	cherva_ what problem are you having?
11:34	<matason>	How do I get the kernel-source files?
11:34	<ringo>	foug: well avi is just a wrapper. any codec can be inside it.  do you by chance know what the encoding really is?
11:34	<Vinitious>	hello, I have a question, plain and simple, what is the default root password for Ubuntu Feisty server?
11:34	<Huffalump>	matason, you can download that through Synaptic
11:34	<dthacker>	Liber: try this at comand line.  sudo ifup eth0
11:34	<Frezeeer>	hi does anyboy know what is the proper name for the faces in planet ubuntu?
11:35	<dthacker>	Vinitious: you set it during install
11:35	<foug>	ringo: under properties >	Audo/Video it says the codex is AC-3 audio
11:35	<mjbrooks>	Vinitious, you use sudo and your password
11:35	<matason>	Huffalump: Ah thanks!
11:35	<Liber>	dthacker: interface eht0 already configured.
11:35	<dthacker>	Vinitious: what mjbrooks said....
11:35	<Vinitious>	i didnt, dthacker, I was only site up a user account
11:35	<Chunkie>	lo
11:35	<foug>	ringo: in a file that doesn't lag the codex is mp1 layer 3
11:35	<Vinitious>	set up, I mean
11:35	<Liber>	dthacker:  I think that's the whole problem.  It's configured wrong.  It keeps going back to a wierd config that doesn't match the live cd.
11:36	<dthacker>	Vinitious: sorry I was wrong. use sudo and your password
11:36	<ringo>	foug: let me summon all my intelect and ponder this one for a few moments
11:36	<Huffalump>	mjbrooks, it's not just you.  any m when highlight squishes together into a square blob.   I never noticed such a behavior before.

11:36	<mjbrooks>	Huffalump, it's been driving me nuts all day, maybe it's a Feisty bug?
11:36	<Huffalump>	mjbrooks, 10 bucks/euros says it's a Feisty thing
11:36	<_trine>	anyone on here know why I cant move open windows around with my mouse unless I press the alt key,, I'm running ubuntu

11:37	<Supaplex>	meh nm. I'll just go to bed.

11:39	<christine_>	mythtv automatically run before the login screen. how do i remove that?
11:39	<Vinitious>	isnt it root on UbuntU?
11:39	<EmxBA>	Vinitious: you need to use your password and username as you've typed in in installation
11:39	<underwatercow>	in samba, I got it so it accepts my username and password, but how to I make it accept someone else's?
11:39	<Liber>	dthacker: /etc/network/configure

11:39	<peteremcc>	hey guys, can anyone help me with resizing my vista partition to make room for ubuntu?
11:39	<foug>	ringo: funny you ask because when i had 6.10 my video lagged when i went to full screen. problem fixed in feisty though, this is only my second week using ubuntu though
11:40	<Agrajag>	dthacker: sudo -i, not sudo sh
11:40	<lisapc>	has anyone been able to convert dvr-ms files to mpeg or divx?
11:40	<underwatercow>	peteremcc: you know vista has a partition editor built in, right?
11:40	<Vinitious>	I have to have root priveleges to install vmware tools, EmxBA
11:40	<mrcreativity>	hello everyone
11:40	<peteremcc>	yes but im having trouble with it... it allows me to shrink my C: by a massive 16MB :D
11:40	<Huffalump>	peteremcc, If you want to make room for Ubuntu before you put Ubuntu on... then you'll need to a) clear some space and then b) use a partition tool in Windows  (in the past I used Partition Magic )
11:40	<_trine>	is there anyway to restore to a previous point like you can in MS windows
11:41	<ringo>	foug: yeah i asked because in feisty w/ XGL my AV doesnt sync at full screen
11:41	<lisapc>	anyone know how to run MythTV?
11:41	<_trine>	I've messed up my display
11:41	<mrcreativity>	alright...im new to ubuntu but have used suse with KDE before, i need a little help
11:41	<peteremcc>	partition magic doesn't seem to support vista yet -and id prefer a free tool if possible
11:41	<underwatercow>	peteremcc: live boot and use gparted?
11:41	<dthacker>	Liber: argh, I don't have that file on me server install.  I think you need another helper.....
11:41	<Liber>	petermcc:  Why not use the gnome partitioner on the live cd
11:41	<mrcreativity>	first, i cant figure out how to edit the bootmanager....
11:41	<underwatercow>	in samba, I got it so it accepts my username and password, but how to I make it accept someone else's?
11:41	<Liber>	dthacker:  Thanks for the help!
11:41	<foug>	ringo: damn ubuntu ;\
11:41	<Huffalump>	peteremcc, gotcha.  Frankly, I didn't know Vista had a tool because I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole.  I agree with use the LiveCD and Ubuntu's gparted (partition editor)
11:41	<peteremcc>	gparted/gnome partitioner? havent heard of these...

11:55	<aatdark>	Agrajag: is there any chanceh that there will be one ?
11:55	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, then it's all standard.  heck, just close the window and if it's not saved it will ask you
11:55	<Agrajag>	aatdark: I doubt it.
11:55	<Liber>	Oooh, hey... could it have anything to do with using IPv6?
11:56	<aatdark>	Agrajag: is there a tecnical problem ?
11:56	<Huffalump>	Liber, heh
11:56	<Agrajag>	aatdark: I don't know.

11:56	<aatdark>	Agrajag: i think im going to write these heliox guys
11:56	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, then it's probably already saved.  close the window.  if prompted, save.  if not, you're good.
11:56	<Agrajag>	aatdark: Since the plugin is closed-source, there's nothing much that can be done besdies writing to Adobe and asking for an AMD64 port
11:56	<mrcreativity>	nope...
11:57	<mrcreativity>	it says i dont have sufficeitn privelages
11:57	<Agrajag>	aatdark: you can, however, run a 32-bit browser, and thus 32-bit plugins, in a 64-bit OS

11:58	<fortitUs>	hey
11:58	<Agrajag>	aatdark: there's a couple different ways. Back when I tried using a 64-bit OS I used a chroot and loaded a 32-bit userland there, the entire OS. I'd suggest looking on the forums for HOWTOs on this stuff
11:58	<mrcreativity>	done...let me try it
11:58	<fortitUs>	I need help again =( how do u join a chat room from GAIM >_>

11:59	<dmhouse>	bgrupe, Huffalump: sure, but Edgy was 4 months after Dapper.
11:59	<aatdark>	Agrajag: i will try

12:02	<mrcreativity>	it works....thanks guys

12:02	<Horscht>	Huffalump, i get no sound
12:02	<mrcreativity>	i have a few more questions
12:03	<mrcreativity>	first, is there anyway to auto logon?

12:03	<Horscht>	that's my problem. I have a Realtek AC97

12:03	<Huffalump>	Horscht, in your Volume Control, which device is chosen?
12:03	<fortitUs>	i was thinking of Itunes
12:03	<fortitUs>	iTunes*
12:03	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, and defeat the whole purpose of security?!
12:03	<Liber>	how do you check the filesystem for errors?  Is there a ubuntu equivilent for window's scandisk?
12:03	<mrcreativity>	well, i use it at home
12:03	<xq>	All have built in mp3 support (and a lot more) basically, you just need the right codecs which most packages (specially in the upgrade tool/packaging tool provided) will auto download upon the installation of your first mp3 app.
12:04	<xq>	iTunes support?
12:04	<fortitUs>	no idea o_o?
12:04	<namelessname>	fortitUs: I don't know if iTunes is available for Linux, but I do know that XMMS or Audacious are great players. If you require MP3 support, you should ask Google, there's allot available :)

12:09	<xq>	askar: I would try to run FireFox, change your settings to how you want it (plugins/themes etc.) and shut down that single session. Open a terminal and run the ps -a command and ensure FireFox is not running. Then try opening it and see if it saved your settings.

It's not an official solution, but I have seen some laptop issues with sound.  Some people claim it works.  http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=scripts
12:11	<chemaja1>	Zues_62, also, you could rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf && dpkg-reconfigure x-server-xorg or whatever it's called

12:13	<Afief>	Argajag: 512 MB
12:14	<chemaja1>	Zues_62, you need to spend some time on http://wiki.ubuntu.com and possibly http://tldp.org and maybe even http://google.com/linux
12:14	<fortitUs>	does GAIM show any popup when a buddy login for Msn?
12:14	<bgrupe>	Vinitious: sudo is a tool, not a user
12:14	<moDumass>	namelessman, samba I did install, but use I know nott
12:14	<chemaja1>	Zues_62, the xorg.conf?
12:14	<chemaja1>	Zues_62, bad idea unless you really understand what it's doing

12:14	<Zues_62>	ok
12:14	<moDumass>	by namelessman I meant namelessname
12:14	<Agrajag>	Afief: OK, first off: create the file. run "sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=512"
12:14	<Zues_62>	chem so did i use the wrong one
12:14	<xq>	Sorry, Pat I mean
12:14	<chemaja1>	Zues_62, no idea
12:14	<askar>	xq: hrm no it seems to last between setttings.. except for one thing.. I choosed to hide the bookmarktoolbar but it came back
12:15	<Horscht>	peter77, i get no sound at all
12:15	<chemaja1>	Zues_62, check out xorg on wiki.ubuntu
12:15	<Huffalump>	Horscht, sorry... did you check the alsamixer?  I'm forgetting that's generally Step #1... to check each and every setting in there.
12:15	<aatdark>	fortitUs: no i dont think so
12:15	<Agrajag>	Afief: that will create an empty file 512 megs in size
12:15	<massiC>	Vinitious: sudo is a command for getting root privileges from a normal user
12:15	<Afief>	Argajag: one sec, I'll have to copy this stuff to the other PC(without swap it keeps crashing
12:15	<Horscht>	yes, checked alsamixer, Huffalump

12:15	<Paul_UK>	hey, can anyone offer an alternative to winamp or foobar player?

12:15	<moDumass>	namelessname, onto it
12:15	<massiC>	Vinitious: you can find some discussion about the alternatives sudo/root on the Ubuntu website
12:15	<Pat__>	yes xq that is correct
12:15	<xq>	Hide bookmark? Is this a plugin or an option?
12:15	<bgrupe>	Vinitious: just type "sudo <command>" where <command>	is what you would normally do

12:23	<xq>	No need then, askar
12:23	<Agrajag>	Afief: OK. If you want to check that it works, you can reboot, and once rebooted, running the command "free" should show you 512 megs of swap space.
12:23	<Huffalump>	Horscht, as ridiculous as it seems I did read someone saying to disable sound in the BIOS - boot into Ubuntu which will detect no card, then reboot, enable sound in BIOS again... and it apparently worked for them.  Personally, I don't see the harm in trying it, but make your own call.  My last parting shot would be to refer you to this page  http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Comprehensive_Sound_Problems_Solutions_Guide   and encourage you to keep trying
12:23	<Huffalump>	here (Americans wake up in a few hours)
12:23	<Agrajag>	Afief: if it doesn't show up, your fstab line may be wrong

12:25	<Agrajag>	mrcreativity: you should probably mention what sound card it is, or at least the model of your laptop
12:25	<askar>	xq: that command tells me if I have 3dsupport tells me no... grep something
12:27	<Afief>	Argajag: yup works perfectly:D that should compensate for the 256MB ram stick that went bad the other day

I've tried installing Ubuntu like this five times, at first I got "error loading operating system" at boot but after the second install it just boots directly into windows. When I force it to boot of the "/" partition I always get "error loading operating system"
12:30	<lisapc>	!ntfs-3g
12:30	<ubotu>	ntfs-3g is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. Installation instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions

12:32	<Heth>	does anyone know how to change the loading screen? the one with the progress bar. I've installed ubuntu and kubuntu, and the screen changed to kubuntu. how to turn it back to ubuntu?
12:32	<spikeb>	Paul_UK, a couple different ways you can do that. one is by clicking the close button on an app...if it's not responding, a window will pop up asking if you want to kill it.
12:32	<mneptok>	Paul_UK: sudo apt-get install htop
12:32	<ExpositionOfEvil>	hey
12:32	<xq>	Paul_UK, In GNOME -->	System / Admin / System Monitor, Paul_UK

12:33	<ExpositionOfEvil>	I found something out
12:33	<Paul_UK>	thanks xq like the first way better
12:33	<Afief>	jedi__ don't know then... if you have a seperate home partition check it's space, that's the only thing that ever made gnome log out on me
12:33	<xq>	Kind of like Window's task manager from that System Manager
12:33	<ExpositionOfEvil>	you need to burn the iso to a cd that is more than 4x speed
12:33	<xq>	It will have a tab
12:33	<ExpositionOfEvil>	cant be 4x
12:34	<jedi__>	Afief_ thanks
12:34	<mneptok>	Paul_UK: htop will be of assistance even if you don't have a GUI
12:34	<aldin>	Heth: just sec ok i have it writen in my howtos
12:34	<Livia>	Any idea why I can't unmount my windows partitions?  It says it doesn't agree with fstab?

12:37	<shiv_j>	lisapc: just type ntfs-3g in terminal
12:37	<mrcreativity>	i have been trying to download the package files for kopete for hours
12:38	<Agrajag>	Shauny: with a decompiler and lots of patience
12:38	<shiv_j>	lisapc: just type ntfs-config
12:38	<Huffalump>	foxiness, no
12:38	<shellex>	Yeah. ntfs-g
12:38	<Huffalump>	Vinitious, I think you are asking if you VMWare works on Feisty; yes it does.
12:38	<kombu>	Do you have any ideas why I always get "error loading operating system" on bootup? I've aldready tried installing five times
12:38	<anarchris>	has anyone here had issue with vlc not playing encrypted dvd on 64 bit feisty?
12:38	<Agrajag>	Shauny: a .so is the unix-world equivalent of a DLL, it's not something you can just edit.
12:38	<Shauny>	agrajag what compiler can i use? im new to Ubuntu and open source
12:38	<Paul_UK>	foxiness im about to install vmware workstation on fiesty
12:38	<mrcreativity>	any one have any s
12:38	<Agrajag>	Shauny: I said a decompiler
12:38	<mrcreativity>	suggestions?
12:38	<Huffalump>	ntfs-3g is the bomb!
12:39	<tripppy>	xq, i can see my PC's USB bluetooth adapter when the PC is off.
12:39	<shellex>	why?
12:39	<Agrajag>	Shauny: in other words, not worth your time. What exactly are you trying to do?
12:39	<Shauny>	but i thought the term "open source" meant that you can just edit any file
12:39	<Agrajag>	Shauny: it's a binary file, it's already been compiled
12:39	<xq>	then it's awake
12:39	<Huffalump>	anarchris, you have the drivers installed?
12:39	<xq>	as far as it waking the PC up is depending on the PC's configuration
12:39	<dZen|n|>	hello, I Just installed ubuntu 7.04, do some of you know a good guide on how to install newest nvidia driver ?
12:39	<shellex>	well. In fact
12:39	<Shauny>	i have found a bug in libpam_mysql and after reporting it i have had no response
12:39	<foxiness>	Paul_UK: then ?
12:39	<Agrajag>	Shauny: if you want to change how a given library works, you'll have to get its source code and change it, and recompile.
12:39	<tripppy>	xq, how do i send it a wakeup packet from my phone?
12:39	<anarchris>	huffalump, which drivers?
12:39	<shellex>	I never do write on ntfs
12:40	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, if you're in a rush, use apt-get.   open up a terminal, sudo install apt-get <packagename>
12:40	<magnetron>	!nvidia | dZen|n|
12:40	<ubotu>	dZen|n|: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto

12:40	<Huffalump>	anarchris, libdvdcss and all that business?  Did you migrate from Edgy or is this a fresh Feisty and you don't know what I'm talking about?

12:40	<lisapc>	shiv_j, I typed that and told it to write to NTFS. but when I try to do that, i get this: You do not have permissions to write to this folder.
12:40	<mrcreativity>	Huffalump: ...thanks. this is the first time im using ubuntu, i just need to get used to its features. ive used suse with kde before, this thing is just too alien. but im willing to learn
12:40	<foxiness>	Paul_UK: k
12:41	<Agrajag>	well, just finished my dist-upgrade
12:41	<kpel>	hello. is anyone else having problems install the ca-certificates package? the postinst script fails.

12:41	<atomiku>	Hey hey
12:41	<anarchris>	fresh feisty, can't obtain libdvdcss on repo for 64
12:41	<mneptok>	mrcreativity: why not use Kubuntu if you're familiar with KDE?
12:41	<papatwilight>	how do i zoom in and out the desktop cube in 7.04
12:41	<Heroin>	mrcreativity ubuntu uses GNOME, there is also a KDE release of ubuntu called Kubuntu
12:41	<mrcreativity>	i wanted try something new
12:41	<shiv_j>	lisapc: reboot and see if it works, not sure how your fstab looks
12:41	<mrcreativity>	i know
12:41	<mneptok>	mrcreativity: ach so.
12:42	<Ravenheart>	hey, i'm new to linux, can i ask you some questions
12:42	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, add/remove programs & Synaptic are basically happy smiley interfaces for apt-get.  I'm a GUI person myself, but I've learned that knowing apt-get can be really helpful.
12:42	<mneptok>	mrcreativity: is Xubuntu next? :)
12:42	<Vinitious>	Huffalump: yes your right, but is asked the wrong question, vmware can work on Feisty, but the vmware tools have a problem (which is a pain because it's much to slow and the mouse does not function properly without it)
12:42	<anarchris>	do you know where I can get a 64 bit libdvdcs .deb?
12:42	<shiv_j>	lisapc: I have not used 7.04 yet
12:42	<vm>	is there a program to unrar files in linux?
12:42	<mrcreativity>	mneptok: ...not likely m8
12:42	<Horscht>	Huffalump?
12:42	<spikeb>	i thought libdvdcss was noarch
12:42	<peteremc1>	im back, if anyone remembers me
12:42	<spikeb>	hmm
12:42	<dave132356>	vm its called unrar
12:42	<Horscht>	got it solved
12:42	<peteremc1>	im in gaim on the live cd
12:42	<Huffalump>	anarchris, just a moment.  there's a solution
12:42	<atomiku>	Just installed ubuntu 7.04 and then xfce, any idea why some of the icons are missing in XFCE4?
12:42	<Hug1>	Hi, I am using Edgy and have a computer with a ethernet motherboard nvidia adaptor. When I use edgy (or feisty) booting from the hard drive it works fine, but when I try to boot this computer from the net, from another computer using edgy it starts to load allright but then it doesnt load the ethernet card and the process ends

12:43	<atomiku>	dreamlinux?
12:43	<Horscht>	yes, it works now
12:43	<shiv_j>	atomiku: hold on sorry
12:43	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, a mac is the least fun of all, then
12:43	<magnetron>	vm: install unrar-free in synaptic
12:43	<dave132356>	vm, or unrar-free
12:43	<mrcreativity>	lol.
12:43	<Huffalump>	Horscht, the BIOS reset?
12:43	<mrcreativity>	Huffalump: ...how come?
12:43	<Horscht>	well, not directyl
12:43	<shiv_j>	atomiku: its samlinux
12:43	<atomiku>	?
12:43	<atomiku>	what is it

01:01	<chowmeined>	Stig: that is just a signature for the real package
01:01	<xq>	vm, Just go to Synaptic Package Manager and do a search for "wine" you will see those three, mark them for installation and hit apply.
01:01	<xq>	Then open it up, it's pretty self explanatory with file paths as long as the drive WC is on is mountable

01:06	<dave132356>	foxiness, sorry it took awhile but it told me i could autoremove some packages so i did that first, then the pastebin accused me of spamming it, here is the result of typing apt-get install http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16776/

01:08	<kasio>	anybody have help? i have  a grub error 18 after a feisty install alongside xp. I think it is because i am using an old bios

01:09	<noob_>	scapor, where should it create it?
01:09	<yagami>	how do I reduce the text size in text terminals?
01:09	<scapor>	in the applications menuor on your desktop
01:09	<vm>	xq: what now?
01:09	<yagami>	i am trying to do that cause i can't fully see the details in rtorrent based on ncurses.
01:09	<scapor>	noob_: if it doesn't it should be in .wine/c_drive or something like that
01:09	<christine_>	LjL : anythere idea? :(
01:09	<Heroin>	yagami in a shell or in cli?
01:09	<Ravenheart>	using Gparted, if i re-size my bigger drive it would totally erase everything in it right?
01:09	<xq>	configure it and point it to the executable for WC
01:09	<Horscht>	oh, how awesome :/
01:09	<scapor>	noob_: then open "Program Files" etc ..you know?
01:09	<dave132356>	yagami, settings>font>shrink
01:10	<Heroin>	Ravenheart no i dont believe it removes
01:10	<rambo3>	Stig, #ubuntu-effects
01:10	<vm>	but how do i install WC?
01:10	<Heroin>	Ravenheart i rember it moved the empty space from one part. to another part.
01:10	<yagami>	Heroin: am not sure how to answer that- what do you get when you press Ctrl+Alt+F1...a tty?
01:10	<Horscht>	i got to decide between two different options: have desktop effects, or be able to watch Videos
01:10	<LjL>	cherva: what is the output of  apt-cache policy nvidia-glx ? and while you're at it, could could just paste your entire /etc/apt/sources.list
01:10	<LjL>	mouse batteries have run out, hold on a second
01:10	<noob_>	scapor, it is located in that yes
01:10	<Ravenheart>	are you sure Geroin?
01:10	<xq>	it should already be installed on your windows partition/drive for WC to run it
01:10	<Stig>	thanka
01:10	<Ravenheart>	Heroin*
01:10	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  how is it coming with Vista and Gparted?  You saw an unallocated space that concerned you?  What is that space supposed to be?  And does your Vista report it the same way gparted does?
01:10	<scapor>	noob_: open that folder and click the exe file
01:10	<peteremc1>	hey thanks Huffalump
01:11	<peteremc1>	im on the live cd
01:11	<Heroin>	yagami ctrl-alf-f1 is command line interface, dont know how to edit the size of that, but if ur running a shell from a gui u can edit the fonts and stuff
01:11	<kerik>	anybody had experience on updating from Edgy to Feisty?
01:11	<peteremc1>	and the link on the desktop allows me to browse my vista install (C:)
01:11	<cherva>	LjL : apt-cache - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16778/
01:11	<Heroin>	Ravenheart iam pretty sure.. u could check the website of gparted..
01:11	<rambo3>	kerik, that not a real question
01:11	<scapor>	noob_: you can create a "Starter" or menu item to it with as command "wine /path/to/itunes.exe" or I think "gnome-open /path/to/itunes.exe" would work too
01:11	<foug>	i just installed a program with wine and now it won't open. help eh?
01:11	<peteremc1>	but when i go to gparted, it says the whole C: is unallocated
01:11	<Blubloblu>	kerik: yes, a bad experience
01:11	<yagami>	Heroin: heh. i am tempted to say 'duh', but will resist :)
01:11	<kerik>	rambo3: true... :)
01:11	<LjL>	christine_: you need to know what is starting the frontend... if you type  ps aux | grep myth , what shows up?
01:11	<peteremc1>	and only allows me to choose "New" (which would wipe everything)
01:11	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  so your Vista partition is 93G which Gparted is reporting as unallocated?
01:11	<kpel>	kerik: just make sure to back up your /etc and your /home . some packages don't seem to work in feisty
01:11	<kerik>	Blubloblu: ok...what happened?
01:11	<peteremc1>	yup
01:12	<yagami>	anywhos, thanks.
01:12	<Heroin>	yagami ^^ duh might be what u think, but for a lot of people there is no sense of what is what with linux
01:12	<cherva>	LjL : sources - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16779/
01:12	<kerik>	kpel: ok...ok...sounds like a good idea
01:12	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  okay.  I don't know the initial answer as I've not seen that, but I'll help you find it.
01:12	<Heroin>	yagami there are a lot of new linux user since 7.04
01:12	<Blubloblu>	kerik, well first i had to rename device names, remount and stuff. Now the nvidea graphics driver doesnt work and if i use vesa, the resolution is too small
01:12	<Ravenheart>	what system should i use for a linix drive
01:12	<foxiness>	dave132356: k
01:12	<Ravenheart>	NTFS?

01:13	<alprr>	hey guys can anyone tell me how to import a file.reg ????
01:13	<yagami>	Heroin: Yes, i can see that from the activity- this place is literally a tower of tux babel.

01:13	<cherva>	LjL : i've just enabled it
01:13	<LjL>	cherva: i'd remove the Milone repository, it's for Edgy anyway not really for Feisty (though perhaps he's got a Feisty one now, not sure - but try with the plain repositories first)
01:13	<Blubloblu>	kerik: very annoying, i'm a bit lost too. I dont see how I can fix it
01:13	<Ravenheart>	first time i use it, its normal for me to be a newb :)

01:15	<dave132356>	Wicks scroll to the bit which is probably titled synaptics touchpad and its one of the options
01:15	<jrib>	noob_: yes
01:15	<Afief>	paul_uk: what do you mean no app can see them? for all the apps are concerned the drives are normal folders now
01:15	<noob_>	ok ill try installing that thanks

01:15	<kerik>	Blubloblu: guess there is no need to ask you if you have tried updating your nvidia drivers?
01:15	<jrib>	noob_: rhythmbox is installed by default
01:15	<nielsm>	wow, on my newly installed amd64 system (i have a number of ata and sata disks, winxp on hda1, installed feisty on hdc1) grub fails to boot. running grub from the livecd is useless, it doesn't seem to be able to do anything (find fails immediately, root fails for any parameters). i tried chroot'ing to my install and setting up lilo, which also fails to install itself
01:15	<Wicks>	davel132356 - I shall try it now, cheers buddy
01:15	<Blubloblu>	kerik: the problem is, i cant acces internet on it
01:16	<kerik>	Blubloblu: actually think I have heard quite a few complaints on the nvidia support in feisty...
01:16	<LjL>	!grub >	nielsm    (nielsm, see the private message from Ubotu)
01:16	<jrib>	Paul_UK: ok, I have no idea how that works.  Nothing shows up in nautilus at all?
01:16	<mesiah>	Hello there!
01:16	<kerik>	Blubloblu: gee...that doesn't exactly make it any easier!
01:16	<Lukemob>	Guys, how to solve it? Read-only filesystem
01:16	<Paul_UK>	jrib: only desktop and home folders
01:16	<jrib>	Lukemob: what filesystem?
01:16	<LjL>	nielsm: grub shouldn't fail installing, if used from the live CD - however, you'll need to mount your (real) root partition somewhere, and then call grub-install with the approrpiate parameters
01:16	<Blubloblu>	kerik: so even if theres a driver, I cant install it
01:16	<peteremc1>	Huffalump, do you mind if i PM you?
01:16	<christine_>	LjL: yes its not running.
01:16	<illJazz>	err
01:16	<kpel>	kerik: also, if you need openoffice or curl it's better to stick with edgy
01:16	<cherva>	LjL: 10x MAN shoud i install also  nvidia-kernel-source it is on suggested packages
01:16	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  yeah, I see much of the same.  While I'm poking around for something reliable, as a pragmatic issue... why were we not using the Vista Disk Manager? Just because?  I don't care really, but I was curious.
01:16	<nielsm>	LjL: that's not the problem, grub fails with error 17 or 18 (can't remember right now)
01:16	<LjL>	cherva: shouldn't be needed
01:16	<Blubloblu>	kerik: right now I'd be happy if I got vesa working in 1600x1200
01:17	<jrib>	Paul_UK: don't know then, maybe someone else can help, but be sure you mention it's a windows share when you repeat your question in a bit :)
01:17	<kpel>	those packages depend on ca-certificates and that package is somewhat broken for now
01:17	<cherva>	LjL: k thx
01:17	<kerik>	Blubloblu: is that due to a bad driver for your lan or?
01:17	<illJazz>	I downloaded VLC, tried Kaffeiene as well as the built-in movie player that comes with Feisty Fawn.. but nothing will play sound on my AVI video files :/
01:17	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  you can do that, but we're more likely to pick up help from others if we keep the chatter here.
01:17	<Pakalaka>	lukemob: your system boots up in read only mode?
01:17	<foug>	!wine
01:17	<ubotu>	wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
01:17	<fiery_cleric>	nielsm what happens when u chroot ? ...
01:17	<wickedpuppy>	shoudl i get i386 version or 64bit version if i am using intel core 2 duo ?
01:17	<illJazz>	what good is Feisty to me if I can't even look at my porn with it?
01:17	<LjL>	nielsm: well, i don't know about that, but you've been trying to reinstall it using the Live CD and failing, or did i not understand?
01:17	<illJazz>	:)
01:17	<mesiah>	Is it possible to update a present Ubuntu 6.10 to 7.04 via apt-get update ? Thank you!
01:17	<kerik>	kpel: oo.org doesn't work on feisty?
01:17	<Blubloblu>	kerik: I have a usb adaptor "Belkin wireless G", it worked in edgy
01:17	<jrib>	!upgrade >	mesiah    (mesiah, see the private message from ubotu)
01:17	<Wicks>	davel132356 - what option should I be looking for?
01:17	<Paul_UK>	jrib: shouldnt really matter, if i have a mounted share on my desktop, i expect every app to see it
01:17	<kpel>	kerik: not after i upgraded :(
01:17	<kerik>	Blubloblu: darn...
01:17	<peteremc1>	ok, no prob... i was having problems with the vista partitioner so it was suggested in here i use the one on the livecd :D
01:17	<Lukemob>	jrib: When I tried upgrade the packages, ... I got this error. ext3_reserve_inode_write: Readonly filesystem.
01:18	<KenC>	Can anyone help with restoring Xserver after upgrade to 7.04?
01:18	<kpel>	kerik: it won't even install. the installer throws an error
01:18	<jrib>	Paul_UK: if you type 'mount', does it show up?
01:18	<kerik>	kpel: that's just a beach
01:18	<peteremc1>	in vista, it was only letting me shrink the partition by 16MB...
01:18	<nielsm>	when i run grub from the livecd it seems to work, but there is no readline support, running "root" on any device fails, "find" fails immediately without even seeming to try
01:18	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  I am hoping we might get you some help on Gparted and Vista from folks like LjL or jrib who have much more knowledge than I do.
01:18	<peteremc1>	i decided that wasn't enough for my new ubuntu installation :P
01:18	<scot524>	mesiah: change 'edgy' to 'feisty' in sources.list, apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade
01:18	<LjL>	christine_: i can't really install mythtv now to check, since it's huge... but do you know what the frontend filename is? (mythtv-frontend, mythfrontend, whatever)... it'd try a  grep myth /etc/init.d/*  to find out what is starting it
01:18	<dave132356>	Wicks i'm not sure google it
01:18	<Ianman>	hi everyone
01:18	<Blubloblu>	kerik: Do you think installing feisty from the cd and wiping my disk would be a good idea?
01:18	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  16 megs would be a little short. heh.
01:18	<Lukemob>	jrib, any idea?
01:19	<kerik>	Blubloblu: I must admit that I have had the same idea....
01:19	<Paul_UK>	jrib: doesnt show my share to windows
01:19	<kpel>	kerik: tell me about it :) i found where the postinstall script exits but i don't know what's wrong: for some reason the script cannot execute successfuly the "db_version 2.0" line
01:19	<webben>	Hi I'm upgrading from Edgy to Feisty and the Distribution Upgrade window has gone blank gray
01:19	<Blubloblu>	kerik: but if it's a friver issue, im not sure if its worth it
01:19	<webben>	Does anyone know what that means?
01:19	<Blubloblu>	kerik: *driver
01:19	<kerik>	Blubloblu: I'm not at all an expert on linux, but in my logic that would clean out all old/bad drivers...
01:19	<nielsm>	fiery_cleric: i remount the install partition with exec, suid, dev permissions, chroot to it, install lilo with aptitude, sets up a standard /etc/lilo.conf, runs lilo, error: Fatal: raid_setup: stat("/dev/hda")
01:19	<fiery_cleric>	nielsm: but can get a working shell when chroot to the installed filesystem?
01:19	<Ianman>	webben: never seen that before :(
01:19	<kerik>	Blubloblu: true
01:20	<jinzo>	i know there's a lot of buzz right now, but is there any other commands for fixing a broken system than apt-get -f install and dpkg --configure -a ?
01:20	<LjL>	nielsm: i'm afraid i'm not familiar enough with grub, but if lilo fails like that too, to my untrained nose it smells like a HD controller driving problem... no?
01:20	<Blubloblu>	kerik: do you know anything on getting usb wifi adaptors to work?
01:20	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  the filesystem is NTFS, correct?
01:20	<jrib>	Paul_UK: k, does it show up when you visit "computer:///" in nautilus?
01:20	<Lukemob>	Pakalaka: I think so. I'm new in Linux.
01:20	<LjL>	jinzo, depends how it's broken
01:20	<Ianman>	I am having trouble getting my screenreoslution higher than 1024x768
01:20	<kerik>	Blubloblu: not very much...sorry...but do you know what chip is used?
01:20	<fiery_cleric>	nielsm: what happens when u run grub-install after chrooting?
01:20	<Paul_UK>	jrib: the windows share works fine, its just that when i am in an application, i cant seem to see the mounted share to be able to then access the files in it
01:20	<Lukemob>	Or can you just tell me, where could I find help?
01:20	<mwe>	!fixres | lanman
01:20	<nielsm>	hmm i'd be surprised if the controller is dying, the mobo is only a few months old, a dual socket 940 (opteron)
01:20	<ubotu>	lanman: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type  sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart  in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
01:20	<jinzo>	LjL, some packages, dependencies problem :S
01:20	<LjL>	cherva: any luck?
01:21	<Blubloblu>	kerik: i thinks its something like FD7050
01:21	<cherva>	LjL: restarting X in a sec
01:21	<peteremc1>	yep NTFS
01:21	<jrib>	Paul_UK: does the application use the gtk file chooser?
01:21	<Paul_UK>	jrib: im using banshee
01:21	<LjL>	jinzo: well, let me see the dependency problems (i.e. all the apt-get output that you find relevant). pastebin the stuff
01:21	<nielsm>	hmm oh... maybe /dev/hda doesn't exist... i should create that first....
01:21	<Ianman>	thanks guys, I will look into it!
01:21	<jinzo>	LjL, and neither of those two commands can't handle it :S
01:21	<scot524>	Blobula: Is the FD5070 usb or PCMCIA?
01:22	<scot524>	Blobula: it's a belkin correct?
01:22	<jinzo>	LjL, ok, but it's ugly :P
01:22	<jrib>	Lukemob: if you google "ext3_reserve_inode_write: Readonly filesystem" there is a lot of discussion, but I don't know anything about it
01:22	<mesiah>	How do I know which version I have? Thank you?
01:22	<jrib>	!version >	mesiah    (mesiah, see the private message from ubotu)

01:22	<tarelerulz>	What is the best search program for gnome or kde ? on par with the search in windows?
01:22	<omaaaar>	mesiah: about ubuntu
01:22	<pjesi>	I have a package that is only in .rpm, .src.rpm, and .src formats, I have tried make on the src package with no luck, what is the recommended method to install this stuff on ubuntu?
01:22	<mwe>	mesiah: type lsb_release -a in a terminal
01:22	<Paul_UK>	jrib: actually never mind, i'll just cross this facility off the list.  i'll listen to my music with foobar player from my vmware machine.
01:22	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, find ...
01:23	<LjL>	pjesi: what program is it?
01:23	<jinzo>	hmmz LjL i did apt-get clean, so cleaned the apt chace and now it is correcting them, will see if it would help
01:23	<jrib>	Paul_UK: rhythmbox should work
01:23	<rambo3>	Lukemob, your ext3 is fried
01:23	<pjesi>	LjL: it is Coral, http://crestwiki.abo.fi/confluence/display/CRL/Coral+0.9.3
01:23	<light-kun>	LjL: samba service keeps stopping whenever its idle for a while, how can i make it persistant even after long idle times?
01:23	<claudiu>	hello there
01:23	<light-kun>	is it configurable in smb.conf?
01:23	<Paul_UK>	jrib: i want something that interacts with my ipod as well, im not interested in getting a bunch of applications to do seperate things, i'd rather use windows and have 1 app do all
01:23	<tarelerulz>	find is good ,but I want something that is bit smart so if I don't spell it just right it can find it.
01:23	<jinzo>	light-kun, probably
01:23	<mesiah>	Thank you. I see have 6.06. So can't ugrade to 7.04:-(
01:23	<tarelerulz>	like windows I just had to know the basic name and I could find stuff
01:24	<jrib>	Paul_UK: you know, I am guessing it is possible to mount smb shares using the mount command right?
01:24	<nielsm>	ok, maybe i managed to install grub again now, i'll be booting (yay for remote irssi+screen)
01:24	<claudiu>	how can I enable  desktop sharing of feisty installation by using command line ?
01:24	<LjL>	light-kun: uhm, never happened to me
01:24	<jinzo>	mesiah, you can upgrade to 6.10 then 7.04 ( that's what i'm doing on my wannabe-server now :P )
01:24	<Paul_UK>	jrib: im staying as far away from the terminal as possible im not interested in learning CLI as that was 10 years ago
01:24	<fiery_cleric>	light-kun: your pc isnt going to sleep is it?
01:24	<tarelerulz>	The find program in gnome and on Konqueror don't seem to find anything
01:24	<LjL>	pjesi: can't find an Ubuntu package at first glance. get the .tar.gz, not the rpm/src files
01:24	<jrib>	Paul_UK: it would be a one time thing
01:24	<mesiah>	Oh thank you jinzo:-)
01:24	<Paul_UK>	jrib: should be 0 time thing to be honest
01:25	<LjL>	pjesi: then try compiling it. i'll give you a guide that should help you getting the basic dependencies right, then if it keeps failing to compile, ask
01:25	<LjL>	!compile >	pjesi    (pjesi, see the private message from Ubotu)
01:25	<pjesi>	LjL: I got the tar.gz, but I cannot compile it so I thought perhaps I should give the rpm a try
01:25	<mbudde>	tarelerulz, have you checked out Beagle?
01:25	<claudiu>	how can I enable  desktop sharing in feisty without clicking on menus ?
01:25	<LjL>	pjesi: better not. rather, pastebin the errors that you get when compiling
01:25	<pjesi>	LjL: ok thanks
01:25	<mesiah>	and how will I do upgrade to 6.10 via shell command? Thank you!
01:25	<sivaji>	edgy to feisty upgrade error ple help me http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16781/ email add sivaji_2009@yahoo.com
01:25	<LjL>	pjesi: (that is, pastebin the whole output from compiling)
01:25	<Huffalump>	Is there a gparted expert here?  Strangeness with a Vista partition being claimed as "unallocated"
01:25	<jrib>	Paul_UK: correct, banshee should be fixed.  I'm just suggesting this if you want it to work in the meantime
01:25	<tarelerulz>	Thanks mbudde

01:27	<claudiu>	does anyone know how can I enable "desktop sharing" without the mouse ?
01:27	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, ssh server or client ?
01:27	<jinzo>	tarelerulz, you would like a ssh-d or only client ?
01:27	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, it replaced nearly all of my XP installs.  Everything from Photoshop to Warcraft.

01:27	<atomiku>	Hey Huffalump
01:27	<tarelerulz>	I would like both a client and sever ,but I would just like something
01:27	<wickedpuppy>	Paul_UK, openoffice ?
01:27	<atomiku>	Huffalump: Did you fix your problem?

01:28	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, I ditched MS Office 2003 for OpenOffice which is far better, for my needs.
01:28	<Erebus>	I did ask my question twice....

01:28	<Huffalump>	atomiku, no!  Made some progress but nvidia drivers still have an API mismatch
01:28	<tarelerulz>	I see ssh-agen on my computer when I look up the procese running

01:29	<LjL>	jinzo: you can see there's a few suggested workarounds - not sure how it's best to proceed. first thing anyway, make very sure you have the edgy-update and edgy-security repositories enabled for all components
01:29	<rambo3>	claudiu, you have rcp porgram in add/install internet section
01:29	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, I use OpenOffice instead of Visio, OpenOffice instead of Office, and I use anything other than Outlook.  Granted, you've got me on Project, but I bet there's a compatible alternative... I just dont use it.
01:29	<tarelerulz>	I am so lost right now I don't really know anything other then what I told you
01:29	<eztk>	Jonah - did you get: "waiting for root file system..." issue after upgrading to Feisty?
01:29	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, pls do this sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start <--- thats to start the ssh server
01:30	<brandon^>	i have a question
01:30	<jinzo>	LjL, i think i have, will double check
01:30	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump, im sure there are certain things you cant do with openoffice, at work we tried to switch over to it, just couldnt do it.
01:30	<Paul_UK>	too many issues

01:30	<brandon^>	i have a question, reguarding dual booting linux/windows, pm me if you can help
01:30	<atomiku>	Huffalump: I completely reinstalled Ubuntu (since everything was f'd anyway)

01:30	<Huffalump>	atomiku, you like!
01:30	<jonah>	eztk: no, its a fresh install, GRUB was just very confused about which drive was which.. and im a n00b, so it took almost a day to figure it out..
01:30	<Huffalump>	atomiku, you lie!
01:30	<rambo3>	claudiu, gnome-rdp
01:30	<LjL>	jinzo: well then try  sudo dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -P courier-authdaemon , that seems to be the #1 proposed solution, though it's not reported to always work either
01:30	<Ianman>	noob_: yeah I have
01:31	<eztk>	jonah: ok
01:31	<Huffalump>	atomiku, ah... a reinstall.  Well, I'm still hoping to avoid that. :{
01:31	<tarelerulz>	it would seem I don't have that command is says
01:31	<Paul_UK>	eztk: you got office 2003 running with crosslinux?

01:31	<Erebus>	Also, can someone recommend a decent mirc-like IRC client for ubuntu?
01:31	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, then you do not have ssh server installed ...

01:31	<jrib>	Erebus: xchat
01:31	<Ianman>	Er
01:31	<chowmeined>	I am trying to but I can't seem to make them have the same amount of sectors exactly
01:31	<Huffalump>	eztk, you mean CrossLinux like a Wine-ish thing?
01:31	<atomiku>	jrib: High five! o/
01:31	<Ianman>	Erebus: Gaim...
01:31	<jinzo>	LjL, i'll go with removing it from status
01:31	<Itchy>	Paul_UK: OO.o is not as good as MS office, but the biggest issue honestly is the fact the MS office doesnt support open document format, and that .doc is not supported very very well by Open Office, since .doc is prprietary.
01:31	<atomiku>	Eww
01:31	<claudiu>	rambo3: desktop sharing is not enabled , how can i activate it by CLI ?
01:31	<atomiku>	Ianman: gaim is horrible for IRC
01:31	<eztk>	Paul_UK: I haven't tried, but I believe it will work. I might get Office 2007 as its only 20 quid, and see if I can get it to work with CrossLinux
01:31	<Erebus>	Thanks - and wine/WoW through a proxy
01:31	<Ianman>	using it right now...no worries
01:31	<atomiku>	Ianman: ugh
01:32	<tarelerulz>	could it be the ex is named something else ?
01:32	<eztk>	huffalump: I believe its like Wine, but far more user friendly apparently
01:32	<atomiku>	Im using XFCE on ubuntu 7.04 but some of the icons are messed up, how can i fix this?
01:32	<Ianman>	oh
01:32	<Ianman>	mkay
01:32	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, whats ex ?
01:32	<alvaro>	anyone knows if i can installl shockwave pulg-in for firefox in ubuntu ?
01:32	<LjL>	jinzo: then i'd try the solution by Fedearne next
01:32	<chowmeined>	OO.o is very slow too
01:32	<Huffalump>	eztk, I've heard distant rumblings about it, I think. Cedega and something (CrossLinux).
01:32	<claudiu>	desktop sharing is not enabled , how can i activate it by CLI ?
01:32	<Paul_UK>	eztk: ok, well i couldnt get it to work and apparently crossover 6.0.1  only rated to office 2000 LOL!!!!!
01:32	<wolfspirit>	question for the room.. is it sage to hit the upgrade button or am I going to have some issues upgrading to fiesty that way?  I've read stories about previous upgrades failing.
01:32	<tarelerulz>	exaqcutble or  how ever you spell it
01:32	<kerik>	POVaddct: hey
01:32	<eztk>	there must be someone here who knows how to fix the buggered up kernal problem which leads to feisty leaving my machine unbootable?? "waiting for root file system" -- hangs then drops to busy box :(
01:32	<pjesi>	LjL: there is no ./configure, is this a problem?
01:32	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: Well, my upgrade f'd everything up
01:32	<omaaaar>	who has a sagem f@st 800 modem?
01:32	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, what's different between Office 2K and 2K3 that you need?  "need!"
01:33	<eztk>	paul_UK: interesting
01:33	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: So... If you wanna risk it, hit the upgrade button
01:33	<Itchy>	Paul_UK dont use crossover. use wine directly; The wine documentation is good enough.
01:33	<LjL>	jinzo: uhm, i'm not particularly fond of the idea of removing it from status... but then i don't really know anything to say for sure
01:33	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump: Simple, I have a licence for 2003
01:33	<Azureday>	alvaro:It can be installed automaticly when you browsing a page with flash.
01:33	<wolfspirit>	atomiku: great.. so did you have to do a fresh install after that I suppose?
01:33	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: yup
01:33	<jinzo>	LjL, then i'll first try the Fedearne, then we will see
01:33	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, I found that WINE worked pretty good for things I needed.  It was not *easy* in every case, but it did work.
01:33	<LjL>	pjesi: yes and no... there doesn't *have* to be a configure, but most programs do have one. read the INSTALL file (there is one, right?), if it just tells you to type "make" straight away, try that
01:33	<eztk>	wolfspirit: the lovely upgrade button has killed my system. that's why im here :(
01:33	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: I spent a whole day trying to fix everything that had broken, until I finaly realized it was time to start again
01:33	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump:  plus its just better, more stable, more functions, etc, etc.....
01:33	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, have you installed this package 'ssh' ?? btw pls search in synaptic for ssh server
01:33	<eztk>	wolfspirit: the damn kernel cant even mount my root file system
01:34	<atomiku>	eztk: yeah, it couldnt mount mine either
01:34	<eztk>	atomiku: how did you fix it?
01:34	<atomiku>	eztk: did ubuntu stop booting?
01:34	<atomiku>	I ment
01:34	<atomiku>	did it freeze at about 1%?
01:34	<tarelerulz>	ok wickedpuppy
01:34	<xq>	SSH Server will be OpenSSH
01:34	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, and pls put my nick in front if you are talking to me :P it get confusing
01:34	<eztk>	atomiku: yeah!
01:34	<eztk>	atomiku: eventually throws me into busybox
01:34	<alvaro>	Azureday, i already have flash installed but i need shockwave and did not find it :(
01:34	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, true ... openssh-server is the package name
01:34	<eztk>	atomiku: apparently its a duff kernel ?!
01:34	<atomiku>	eztk: I had the same problem. All I can suggest is that you get 7.04 on acd, and start again
01:34	<LjL>	pjesi: oh, fine, no install instructions.
01:34	<eztk>	atomiku: or bad mapping ?
01:34	<pjesi>	LjL: yes I know
01:34	<atomiku>	eztk: I spent a whole day trying to fix it, with no luck
01:34	<jinzo>	LjL, tried, but can't install courier-authlib because of dependencies problems :S
01:34	<eztk>	atomiku: reinstall ???
01:34	<brandon^>	 Can i install ubuntu on a different hard drive rather than a different partition on the same hard drive i run windows on.
01:34	<nielsm>	hah! i managed to install lilo, now to see if it'll boot :D
01:35	<tarelerulz>	<wickedpuppy>	,  well I will try to do that
01:35	<atomiku>	eztk: Yup, reinstall.
01:35	<xq>	Yes, brandon
01:35	<Ianman>	atomiku: yeah I guess xchat is better ;)
01:35	<Itchy>	Paul_UK: you wont get "more" anything by running things in any "emulator". and damn if wine is not an emulator i dunno.
01:35	<atomiku>	Ianman: :)
01:35	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, well I think this thread started when you made the assertion that Ubuntu was ready to replace XP and I asserted that it was ;)  It may not be ready for primetime running of Microsoft's "We only work on Windows" Office which is purposefully designed to be OS-specific.  But you can hardly blame ubuntu for that.  Anyway, I say it is ready for primetime and there are many compatible solutions for many people's needs.  Apparently, your needs may
01:35	<Huffalump>	not be met at this time and I can totally empathize with that.
01:35	<xq>	Then just modify your MBR using the utility included to dual boot
01:35	<eztk>	atomiku: ohh no.. NOT again :((((( i had to do similar when I did dapper >	edgy
01:35	<Blubloblu>	kerik: dont you find it ironic, that to get a driver for a internet device, you need to download it off the internet?
01:35	<xq>	lol
01:35	<wolfspirit>	question for the whole room:  Has anyone successfully upgraded to fiesty and I'm not talking about a fresh install.  If so, do you have a link to the instructions you followed?
01:35	<nielsm>	i installed ubuntu on a different drive and now i'm having these huge problems making anything boot at all :( (i don't know if it's a general problem though)
01:35	<Ianman>	lol
01:35	<LjL>	jinzo: give me the output of it all
01:35	<eztk>	atomiku: good job i moved /home to a separate partition... given what happened last time
01:36	<jinzo>	LjL, it's borked, how do i change the msgs it outputs to english ?
01:36	<Itchy>	Huffalump: i thought the Mac people had Office as well ?!
01:36	<compwiz18>	I'm having trouble with fglrx on Feisty... can someone give me a hand?
01:36	<eztk>	atomiku: why cant they make this damn upgrade work properly??? they might as well rename the button [REINSTALL] 
01:36	<rambo3>	nielsm, make /boot/ on first disk and / on second drive
01:36	<nielsm>	and now to boot again.... (and i just got rhythbox working again! damn)
01:36	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump, i disagree with your statement that its ready to replace windows..  where is the replacement for winamp or foobar player, for starters.
01:36	<mwe>	nielsm: I don't think it's related to the fact that's it's installed on a different hdd
01:36	<jinzo>	LjL, i think i got it fixed
01:36	<tarelerulz>	 Well, wackedpuppy I am going to install open-ssh-sever
01:36	<LjL>	pjesi: did you already do  sudo apt-get install swig ? that's the first thing it complains about here
01:36	<pmMike>	hi, my login screen is showing up at a stupidly high resolution (but zoomed on one corner) and i can just about log into my account where te resolution goes back down to normal. I've had a look in the xorg.conf file and it's only got my native resolutions in there. What should I do to fix this?
01:36	<jinzo>	executed dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -P courier-authdaemon
01:36	<brandon^>	does ubuntu support 2560x1600 resolution?
01:36	<mwe>	nielsm: do you know the linux names of the drives?
01:36	<Itchy>	Paul_UK: there are more replacements for winamp than you know !
01:36	<Itchy>	and winamp sucks !
01:36	<omaaaar>	nobody tried speedtouch with feisty?
01:36	<eztk>	atomiku: is it not possible to upgrade the install through live CD?
01:36	<xq>	Paul_UK: There are better replacements for audio products (on the gui) in Linux. But, when it comes down to it, it's up to taste.
01:37	<Huffalump>	Itchy - Microsoft dropped Mac support like a hot potato.  They abandoned both IE and Office and some other cruft.  Windows Media Player, if memory serves.  They only launch Mac stuff for a very short while and then leave everyone hanging on purpose to push changeover to Windows.  Think like a drug dealer; the first hit is free.
01:37	<Paul_UK>	Itchy. hence why i said foobar player lol
01:37	<LjL>	jinzo: good (anyway what's the language, if it's not too weird i should be able to guess the messages)
01:37	<eztk>	does everyone agree that I need to reinstall?!?
01:37	<mwe>	nielsm: if it's ide they're probably hda and hdb or something like that
01:37	<atomiku>	eztk: Yup
01:37	<wolfspirit>	brandon^: as long as your hardware supports it
01:37	<xq>	Paul_UK: There are a -ton- of WinAMP-like (+better functioning) in Linux.
01:37	<eztk>	atomiku: and do you know what caused this problem?
01:37	<pjesi>	LjL: yeah I got pretty far
01:37	<noob_>	<noob>
01:37	<benhetfield>	salut tout le monde
01:37	<brandon^>	 it does :D
01:37	<jinzo>	LjL, so with a combination of Fedearne "fix" and udo dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -P courier-authdaemon
01:37	<eztk>	paul_uk: xmms
01:37	<kerik>	Blubloblu: I have had the very same thought a lot of times :)
01:37	<joeri>	i just updated my update-manager on edgy, and now i doesnt propose me anymore the update to feisty... any hints?
01:37	<atomiku>	eztk: Yup, the kernel is completely screwed
01:37	<xq>	Paul_UK: I favor XMMS though.
01:37	<jinzo>	LjL, nah msgs get cluttered, so i suspect it's because of the lang :S
01:37	<pmMike>	hi, my login screen is showing up at a stupidly high resolution (but zoomed on one corner) and i can just about log into my account where te resolution goes back down to normal. I've had a look in the xorg.conf file and it's only got my native resolutions in there. What should I do to fix this?
01:37	<Paul_UK>	eztk: so does that allow me to sync up my ipod tho?
01:37	<atomiku>	brb guys
01:37	<LjL>	pjesi: then please give me the output of how far you've got, so i can try to see what's next
01:37	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, I love VLC over any other media player.  However, most others like Rhythmbox and other iTunes-like stuff.
01:37	<eztk>	atomiku: is there no way of upgrading the kernel?
01:37	<atomiku>	eztk: good luck with the reinstall ;)
01:38	<Paul_UK>	I use VLC player, for both wxp and linux
01:38	<eztk>	paul_uk: i dont have one, so i cant comment
01:38	<brandon^>	 does anyone like my pink?
01:38	<nielsm>	IT'S BOOTING yay :D lilo worked :)
01:38	<cherva>	LjL: no luck  problem with   "glx" i deleted it and still cant boot with nvidia driver
01:38	<pjesi>	LjL: yes I am compiling atm
01:38	<claudiu>	Paul_UK: I want to connect by remote login to a feisty machine but the screen is black
01:38	<Paul_UK>	eztk: i've read that it doesnt
01:38	<xq>	VLC is also up there with a nice piece of multimedia software
01:38	<Blubloblu>	kerik: man, feisty is a pain in the ass!
01:38	<Itchy>	Huffalump:yep, but if Mac people can run Windows on their Mac, then they gain something i beleive. Especially since apple is a more evil corp. than MS
01:38	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, yeah I use VLC on linux, Mac, and XP

01:40	<Erebus>	Although gnome xchat blows

01:43	<Afief>	brandon^: if you're willing to get your hands a bit dirty, Feisty Fawn, if you want something proven to work, Dapper Drake
01:43	<atomiku>	hmm
01:43	<Erebus>	wolfspirit, thanks will give it a bash!
01:43	<atomiku>	OpenBox seems alright

01:43	<Caramba>	Hiya folks. How do a force an external usb-drive to lways be associated with a certain device file? I have an external drive that is associated with sdb, but I'd like it to be sda. Thx in advance!
01:43	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, localhost is your own computer... nvm 'ssh 127.0.0.1' <--- this command
01:43	<mikeconcepts>	I have to ask this question, since it seem odd, there have been no updates for 4 days, I'm on Feisty beta for paste few months and assumed nothing was needed after release
01:43	<eztk>	atomiku: will I lose settings by installing? what i mean is, will my /home in the other partition help??
01:44	<brandon^>	I just downloaded the 7.04 x64 version, any negatives by going with 64 bit?
01:44	<Hor|zon>	wickedpuppy: it's ridiculously easy after the first time I could remember the commands off of the top of my head
01:44	<eztk>	im not going to feel so bad about reinstalling if my /home settings are useful and picked up
01:44	<eztk>	like firefox for example
01:44	<eztk>	with all the bookmarks and settings
01:44	<LjL>	pjesi: that looks like a nice tell-nothing error, granted :) let me fiddle
01:44	<jrib>	brandon^: yes, you will have headaches gettings multimedia stuff like flash and java plugin to work
01:44	<xq>	mike00: maybe an unofficial weekend for developers? ;)
01:44	<Huffalump>	eztk, come back and let us know how it went?  I may have to follow in your footsteps at this point

01:44	<brandon^>	So sack up and use 32 huh?
01:44	<cherva>	LjL: i thing there is a problem with nvidia's version of the driver and the xorg's version maybe expecting something other i don't know what am I talking about
01:44	<xq>	not for what I have installed at least, mikeconcepts
01:44	<Huffalump>	brandon^, I run AMD64 and there are small annoyances as mentioned, but I do not find it a major problem.
01:45	<dor>	I created a new user, with the name "guest". Somehow I'm able to access my home folder (/home/dor) from within the "guest" user. How can I create a user with virtually no privileges at all?

01:45	<chowmeined>	the feisty alternate cd is broken
01:45	<jinzo>	dor, you need to chroot it afaik
01:45	<zzz_>	Hello, what does feisty fawn mean? I know that it is the code name for 7.04 but would like to learn what it means for a native English speaker.
01:45	<sivaji>	jrib:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16781/
01:45	<eztk>	i hope im not contributing to the destruction of peoples boxes
01:45	<jrib>	brandon^: if you use your computer to view alot of media and you are relatively new, 32bit is better.  64bit isn't worth it in that case
01:45	<BlackDesign>	chowmeined: download it again :=p
01:45	<chowmeined>	i cant make logical volumes on lvm
01:45	<Paul_UK>	isnt a fawn a under deer?
01:46	<xq>	A deer that is energetic ;p
01:46	<chowmeined>	no it has the correct md5.. and the cd verified itself
01:46	<jinzo>	dor, so you completly cut him off
01:46	<Huffalump>	brandon^ basically, what happens for Flash & Java... is you end up installing FireFox twice  (default install is Fx64 and that's already there.... you add the second Fx32 which you can then use Flash and Java with).  Follow me?  Small annoyance but easily worked around.
01:46	<Paul_UK>	*young not under lol
01:46	<eztk>	hmmm, so it looks as though no ones managed to fix it without reinstalling it... as you can see, im trying to delay this.. lol
01:46	<chowmeined>	the installer freaked out
01:46	<zzz_>	xq and Paul_UK: thanks
01:46	<xq>	Young deer that is energetic? lol
01:46	<xq>	:) no problemo
01:46	<brandon^>	Im simply testing it out. So go with x64.
01:46	<dor>	jinzo, ah?
01:46	<Paul_UK>	personally, its still born LOL
01:46	<tarelerulz>	I did ssh my ip and I got in I think

01:46	<pjesi>	LjL: yeah that is why I considered the RPM package
01:46	<dor>	jinzo, I didn't understand you answer

01:46	<xq>	yes, eztk, through the upgrade
01:47	<brandon^>	Any good games for Linux?
01:47	<chowmeined>	thats what it is

01:47	<eztk>	xq: unfortunately the upgrade killed the ability to boot :(
01:47	<xq>	eztk: using the upgrade manager
01:47	<chowmeined>	the installer just segfaulted

01:47	<christine_>	please help me. :)i want to remove the upper and lower panel of my gnome? what is the command?
01:47	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, don't have what ?
01:47	<Huffalump>	brandon^ I don't disagree with jrib.  It is correct that if you want the easiest environment, go with 32 because you won't have the few extra hassles.  But if you've got any interest in getting your fingers dirty then 64 isn't too tough.
01:47	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, which command ?
01:47	<tarelerulz>	 nvm 'ssh 127.0.0.1 I don't have this
01:47	<xq>	It might be able to keep most of your files in tact, perhaps not the programs exactly.
01:47	<Lorvija>	Hey.. is there a way to ban a ip address for x mins after he has x failed login attempts in  ssh/ftp... noticing some ppl trying to brute force my machine.. :/
01:47	<eztk>	xq: hangs on "waitinf for root file system" or something
01:47	<break_>	fbi?
01:48	<brandon^>	Huffalump: Im a CS major, just never dealt with linux, i can probably figure it out?
01:48	<dor>	Ubuntu needs to have a parental control feature if it wants to control the low-end family market
01:48	<Huffalump>	brandon^ like Savage?  or Warcraft?  Thos work... what other games?  There's a bunch of old-school games, too, if you're down with that.
01:48	<jinzo>	dor, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot , there is something simmilar you can do with an user
01:48	<jrib>	sivaji: what is the context here?  What version of ubuntu?  Is this botched upgrade?

01:49	<pjesi>	LjL: ok thank you
01:49	<Huffalump>	brandon^ Ah, then you'll probably like the 64 bit.  Look, it works great!  There's just a few annoyances (Flash player, Java) that have known and well-working work arounds.   I say: get into it!
01:49	<LjL>	cherva: that's often not a good idea, especially when you start getting kernel updates

01:52	<Huffalump>	brandon^ I believe that depends on the driver you install for your video, but there *is* some support for Quad SLI.  I am not an expert, but it does exist.
01:52	<chowmeined>	The feisty alternate cd's installer just segfaulted while I was trying to make lvm volumes...
01:52	<dor>	wickedpuppy, of course, but you can't go to your friend's house 24/7

01:52	<slimaq>	anybody can help me?
01:52	<PirateHead>	brandon^: Ubuntu does not support Quad SLI because the drivers for such a setup have not been worked out. You could set up a Quad SLI, but it would not give you the same performance boost. Huffalump says that there might be some support, and that's nice... I just haven't heard of it before.

01:58	<fiery_cleric>	PirateHead: ok yeah thats probably something to do with it i am not sure how to fix tho :(

01:58	<Blubloblu>	How do i install a driver for a wireless networking adapter, if im not connected to internet?
01:58	<jrib>	th3e: right click>	properties >	open with
01:58	<Erebus>	Still no luck  - WoW doesn't see the proxy
01:59	<fiery_cleric>	Blubloblu: no wired connection? ... laptop?
01:59	<Erebus>	I imagine wine isn't seeting the gnome proxy settings
01:59	<pjesi>	LjL: you are right, now it is down to a syntax error :)
01:59	<cypher1>	reiki, is your partitions are labeled data, data-1 etc ?
01:59	<ulti2001>	cypherl, i found out it was for azureus it name is gij-4.1
01:59	<Erebus>	But I can't find proxy settings for wine...
01:59	<Horscht>	the problem is: i have an old ATI gaphics card, which isn't supported by the official driver
01:59	<th3e>	jrib: yes how do i add extra applications from which to choose from?
01:59	<Blubloblu>	fiery_cleric: of course, how stupid of me!
01:59	<UbuntuN00B_HBG>	Hi all! After upgrading to Feisty no mpg / avi videos will play correctly.... i can hear the sound but theres no video...
01:59	<jrib>	th3e: on the bottom, there should be a button to add a custom command
01:59	<reiki>	cypher: I did not label the partitions. And e2label and tune2fs don't seem to work in Feisty
01:59	<Erebus>	Anyone got any ideas?
01:59	<LjL>	cherva: you seem to have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10-generic installed, and that's not normal, it's edgy stuff... try removing it. remove also linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-386 and install inux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic instead
01:59	<ulti2001>	cypherl, it takes up 54 percent of my cpu
02:00	<jrib>	th3e: "add"
02:00	<LjL>	cherva: pastebin what apt-get says *before* hitting Yes, in each case
02:00	<henk1>	the live cd fails when starting X, with in /var/log/xorg.0.log  as final error "could not open default font fixed"
02:00	<cherva>	LjL: my os is upgraded from egy
02:00	<pjesi>	LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16791/
02:00	<LjL>	pjesi: a syntax error with traceback, that repeats like 10 times?
02:00	<eztk>	huffalump: not sure how that would help. i think i'd need to somehow boot from liveCD and fix the kernel from there
02:00	<beerockxs>	I just updated to Feisty, and now my screen in gdm is wrong, large parts of the screen are not visible, and the username/password prompt is not in the physical center of the screen
02:00	<cypher1>	reiki, is those windows partitions ?
02:00	<henk1>	anyone got any ideas?
02:01	<beerockxs>	I use the fglrx BigDesktop option
02:01	<beerockxs>	any idea how to fix that?
02:01	<th3e>	jrib: i want the icon application to appear too. just adding doesn't do that.
02:01	<cherva>	LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16792/
02:01	<LjL>	cherva: i imagined, but still i don't think you should have especially the latter package installed (and have -generic instead). what does "uname -r" give you btw?
02:01	<pjesi>	LjL: yes it is very strange
02:01	<reiki>	cypher1, no, they are ext3. If I boot to Edgy I can label them using e2label but I can not seem to change labels in Feisty
02:01	<christine_>	how do i remove gnome-panel.? when i tried to killall gnome-panel. it will go back.
02:01	<jrib>	th3e: what application?  what extension?
02:02	<cherva>	LjL: 2.6.20-15-386
02:02	<LjL>	pjesi: uhm actually, it's slightly different from the errors i get, though they still involve kernel.py
02:02	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: I'm googling the error now, see if you can find out what program it is trying to call with that wrong option
02:02	<Spee_Der>	Good morning everyone.
02:02	<fiery_cleric>	christine_: look at system->preferences->session ....
02:02	<Notchnick>	Good afternoon Spee_Der
02:02	<tarelerulz>	I have to say in the last week or so I have been have great fun getting Ubuntu up and running
02:02	<LjL>	cherva: uhm, ok hit Yes, and install also "linux-generic"
02:03	<sivaji_2009>	jrib: i cant get u
02:03	<th3e>	jrib: for eg if I add azureus to torrent(which i did not install from repo) just the word "azureus" appears in open with option and not "Azureus".
02:03	<tarelerulz>	So any of you  use hurd and if so what do you think of it as a kernel ?
02:03	<LjL>	cherva: using the 386 kernel is generally not a good idea, and that's what you're using. i can't be sure, but i quite think it's related to the nvidia problem.
02:03	<cherva>	LJL: removeing linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-386
02:03	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: you are "sivaji" right?
02:03	<HYPOCRISY>	hello
02:03	<pjesi>	LjL: must be some some package mismatch on our systems
02:03	<Huffalump>	Anyone able to help with Gparted?  Trying to resize an existing Vista partition, but gparted is reporting it as "unallocated" space.
02:03	<LjL>	pjesi: you on feisty?
02:04	<sivaji_2009>	yes
02:04	<LjL>	cherva: that is when doing what?
02:04	<pjesi>	LjL: no, edgy
02:04	<cherva>	LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16793/
02:04	<jrib>	th3e: because you're azureus doesn't have a proper .desktop file installed, why not use the repo version?
02:04	<sivaji_2009>	jrib yes
02:04	<fiery_cleric>	Huffalump: what does sudo fdisk -l /dev/hda give u?
02:04	<HYPOCRISY>	tell me
02:04	<compwiz18>	Anyone able to help with fglrx on Feisty?
02:04	<cherva>	LjL: in grub there also is the generic kernel should i use it instead of 386 ?
02:04	<Erebus>	Anyone know how I can set wine up to use a proxy?

02:05	<christine_>	i want to do is i want to hide the gnome-panel every time i run mythtv frontend. can somebody give me an idea how to this?
02:05	<th3e>	jrib: it crashes all the time and also there is no updating possible.
02:05	<LjL>	cherva: correct
02:05	<tarelerulz>	The repo version my not be the newest version of azureus . That is why I don't all ways go with the repo myself
02:05	<jrib>	th3e: did you file bugs?
02:05	<henk1>	Hi, does anyone ecountered a strange problem with the desktop cd not starting X with the error "could not open default font fixed"
02:05	<LjL>	cherva: don't remove the other kernel yet though - you never know
02:05	<Horscht>	brb, gotta make me something to eat
02:05	<cypher1>	reiki, what does your fstab says
02:05	<LjL>	pjesi: well i'm on feisty, maybe some python differences
02:05	<pjesi>	perhaps
02:05	<ajehuk>	henk1 - yes but only ever with an installed X server not with a live CD
02:05	<Huffalump>	fiery_cleric just a moment!
02:05	<cherva>	LjL: ok before i reboot showld i install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic
02:06	<Erebus>	Anyone know how I can set wine up to use a proxy?
02:06	<th3e>	th3e: no but there are a lot of similar complains in the forums
02:06	<Boffin>	Hello. I cannot connect to the internet from kubuntu pc through windows machine :( Can anybody help please!
02:06	<ch1ll4>	.xs4all.nl
02:06	<LjL>	cherva: it didn't get installed by default when installing linux-generic? yes, install it
02:06	<ajehuk>	Erebus - for all tcp traffic?
02:06	<LjL>	cherva: do also a  dpkg --get-selections | grep linux  and paste it before rebooting
02:06	<jrib>	th3e: the easiest way is for you to either grab .desktop from the repo version or create your own .desktop file
02:06	<Huffalump>	petermc1
02:06	<Huffalump>	peteremc1
02:06	<th3e>	jrib: ok will try that.
02:07	<th3e>	jrib: thnaks. see you later.
02:07	<Erebus>	ajehuk, yes - but specifically, i am running World of Warcraft ... on windows I used sockscap
02:07	<delire>	beerockxs: i read of another person having the same problem but can't find the article, or how he/she fixed it.
02:07	<cherva>	LjL: ok installing linux-generic now paste bin will come in a sec
02:07	<beerockxs>	delire: hmm.
02:07	<beerockxs>	google to the rescue, I guess

02:07	<ytsestef>	hello! i have troubles getting amarok to work in ubuntu feisty (x86), flac is not supported while, when i load an mp3 file it just hangs
02:07	<rellik>	my sound is somewhat broken since the update. I have a playlist in amarok, but (literally) every other file fails to play.  the equalizer bars dance around, as if the song were playing, but there is no sound
02:08	<chowmeined>	aha i figured out
02:08	<cherva>	LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16795/
02:08	<henk1>	ajehuk: Well I don't get it shouldn't be happening
02:08	<cherva>	LjL: reboot now ?
02:08	<sivaji_2009>	jrib ple help me
02:08	<LjL>	pjesi: yikes btw hold on a second... not that this will likely solve anything, but i didn't pay attention to the fact that there's a "debian" directory in there. that means it's ready (or being made ready) to be packaged
02:08	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: I am searching, patience :)
02:08	<Erebus>	Anyone know how I can set wine up to use a proxy?
02:08	<chowmeined>	has anybody else experienced this problem? On the ubuntu 7.04 alternate cd when making lvm logical volumes the installer hangs for about 2 minutes for each volume being created?
02:09	<sivaji_2009>	jrib ok
02:09	<chowmeined>	its a really serious problem
02:09	<ytsestef>	chowmeined, this is a known issue you're talking about. see the release notes
02:09	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: ah, thank you
=== docMuerto is now known as doc|

02:09	<ubunt1>	hi
02:09	<ubunt1>	i have ubuntu 7
02:10	<RandomizeR>	my nvidia card is acting weird, xorg.0.log says something about "too many errors, falling back to legacy driver" and anything with hardware acceleration closes right after opening :-/
02:10	<Lukemob>	Do I need to do something, if I want to add HDD?
02:10	<RandomizeR>	nvidia 5200, using feisty but had the problem since edgy
02:10	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR what model is your video card
02:10	<pjesi>	LjL: it doesn't look like much in that directory
02:10	<roberto-7>	hi all
02:10	<RandomizeR>	at first i thought it was a problem with my system, but i just did a clean install and it's still there
02:10	<Stormx2>	Is there a gtk based database management system? Like Microsoft Access of Kexi?
02:10	<trol0s>	anyone know how to change the port used by the integrated BitTorrent client?
02:11	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: hmmm,did you install it correct.
02:11	<rellik>	my sound is somewhat broken since the update. I have a playlist in amarok, but (literally) every other file fails to play.  the equalizer bars dance around, as if the song were playing, but there is no sound
02:11	<ajehuk>	Erebus - I'm not all that familiar with how wine handles its networking, but I assume it simply passes everything off to the host, in which case I would look at configuring it within linux using an application-level proxy - thats about as much as I can suggest though - I have no other ideas...
02:11	<RandomizeR>	followed the guide
02:11	<ytsestef>	ello! i have troubles getting amarok to work in ubuntu feisty (x86), flac is not supported while, when i load an mp3 file it just hangs
02:11	<ubunt1>	rellik did you try vlc
02:11	<yannick_>	nick nikkie13
02:11	<delire>	beerockxs: yes, i'm afraid that will be the case.
02:11	<trol0s>	lot's of ppl repeating themselves here :P
02:11	<roberto-7>	i have a number of problems on desktop- effects on ubuntu7.4. is this the right place to ask questions?
02:11	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: do you understand bash?
02:11	<delire>	beerockxs: is this a laptop?
02:12	<ytsestef>	in short: i can't play back any mp3 or flac or wav file in amarok!
02:12	<Huffalump>	trol0s, just go to the advance settings of your BitTornado
02:12	<ubunt1>	roberto-7: what happend
02:12	<delire>	ytsestef: can you play them in other applications?
02:12	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: i followed the guide from the "!nvidia" link, so yeah i suppose it was installed correctly
02:13	<yagami>	Hi, folks. I have shared a directory on my smb server and i want users on another computer running Windows to login with user and password set on the smb server
02:13	<ubunt1>	roberto-7: i too have problems with effect in ubuntu 7,and i disable it,do you know that they are in beta.
02:13	<leejohn>	good day guys, i have a acer aspire 5570 with Intel ALC883 audio, i have a problem with sound anyone care to assist me, thanks a lot
02:13	<roberto-7>	i enable them.. sometine the desktop freezes completely!! no chanche to enter in any console on ctrl-alt bksp
02:13	<yagami>	but when i double click the link, it gives the permission denied error
02:13	<reiki>	anyone know how to change the label on a volume in Feisty?
02:13	<trol0s>	Huffalump: but I don't use that.. but the simple integrated one.. don't know if I have BitTornado
02:13	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: hmmm,sometime the guide from nvidia are incorrect
02:13	<ytsestef>	delire: yes! amarok says there are no flac codecs. as for mp3, it pops up a message which asks me to install mp3 codecs and before i am able to click "yes" the application hangs
02:13	<RandomizeR>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16796/
02:13	<Erebus>	ajehuk: Thanks
02:14	<Huffalump>	trol0s, ubuntu default is BitTornado.  it pops up a window per torrent, right?
02:14	<RandomizeR>	that's the xorg.0.log file
02:14	<beerockxs>	delire: no, not a laptop. a desktop with a CRT and an LCD connected at the same time
02:14	<beatrice>	I have an AVI that VLC stops playing a few minutes in, even though I downloaded the whole thing. Is there a program to fix "broken" AVIs?
02:14	<delire>	ytsestef: right, that isn't good. is your system updated?
02:14	<cherva>	LjL: back online with gui
02:14	<LjL>	cherva: and nvidia-glx based gui?
02:14	<ubunt1>	beatrice: hmm i know to repair for windows
02:14	<delire>	beerockxs: ahah.. that's different. is it an ati card?
02:14	<Huffalump>	trol0s along the top of that small window is some blue, underlined links (I think 4).  One them is Settings/Preferences and it's in there you can set the ports (I stopped using it because I liked another one better)
02:14	<cherva>	LjL: i'll try in a sec
02:14	<trol0s>	Huffalump: yeah.. guess I'll look for BitTornado then =)
02:14	<ytsestef>	i have just installed ubuntu 7.04 (clean install) it is upadated, i mean it was released 2 days ago!!
02:14	<ubunt1>	beatrice: but i don't remember the program.
02:15	<beerockxs>	delire: yes, using the fglrx driver and the bigdesktop option
02:15	<ubunt1>	ytsestef: yes,and is it work,or not work.
02:15	<jonah>	hi guys having a bit of trouble, i deleted my default user to make a new one but now sudo and any admininstrative stuff not working
02:15	<jonah>	messed up somewhere
02:15	<cherva>	LjL: u got skype ?
02:15	<jonah>	the new user i made can't takeover as the main one it seems
02:15	<LjL>	cherva: no - and honestly i refuse to install that evil proprietary stuff :)
02:15	<SoftIce>	hi, anyone know of a vserver kernel for ubuntu feisty ? or should I still continue to use the edgy vserver kernel ?
02:15	<ytsestef>	ubunt1: what do you mean?
02:15	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: right now, the login screen starts with white rectangles all over, and as i said, hardware acceleration doesn't work
02:16	<Huffalump>	trol0s, in case I wasn't clear.  You must have a torrent open at the time you want to modify the ports.  Counterintuitive for me, but that's how it works.
02:16	<cherva>	LjL : :)
02:16	<delire>	beerockxs: you'll need to look at support for TV out. can you paste you /etc/X11/xorg.conf in a pastebin?
02:16	<cherva>	LjL: restarting now
02:16	<trol0s>	Huffalump: yeah on the BitTornado client I guess? Cause this small simplistic client doesn't have any settings option
02:16	<ubunt1>	ytsestef: some  times after update is not working.
02:16	<Huffalump>	trol0s just a moment and I'll verify
02:16	<trol0s>	thanks mate
02:16	<beerockxs>	delire: uh, why tv out? In gnome, everything works fine, it's just gdm that's messed up. But yeah, I can pastebin it, give me second
02:16	<delire>	ytsestef: i don't know what to suggest here other than trying to install support for these codecs manually. look at the RestrictedFormats section of the help wiki
02:16	<sivaji_2009>	jrib yes
02:16	<LjL>	pjesi: i've been able to build a Debian source package
02:16	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: did you try to see is there are disabled the options
02:16	<xukun_>	hi all
02:16	<LjL>	pjesi: probably won't compile just like it didn't compile manually, but
02:16	<delire>	beerockxs: how are you getting signal to the second monitor?
02:17	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR:  try nvidia-settings
02:17	<pjesi>	LjL: well it is a start
02:17	<pjesi>	LjL:  can you give my the command you used?
02:17	<Huffalump>	trol0s, the link says Prefs.  click it and it's in there.
02:17	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: are there any workarounds for it?
02:17	<ytsestef>	delire: i have the restricted package installed :(
02:17	<ubunt1>	nvidia for UBuntu or Linux they make it like windows,now you can see the temp of the video,agp how you can put and something more.;
02:17	<velko>	jonah, start from a live cd, edit /etc/passwd and change the user id and the group id for your new user to 1000 (default for your first user)
02:17	<delire>	beerockxs: does it have two VGA outs?
02:17	<beerockxs>	delire: I'm using the Mode2, HSync2, VSync2 and Pairmodes options of fglrx
02:18	<delire>	ytsestef: right
02:18	<xukun_>	when I boot from de feisty cd so I can install I get green/yellow screen en then it freezes, any suggestions please?
02:18	<ataylor>	hi. I just upgraded to 7.04, and my hard drives are a bit messed up... my ntfs partition (hda1) can no longer be mounted using "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/hda1" and I keep on getting the error "[mntent] : warning: no final newline at the end of /etc/fstab"
02:18	<LjL>	pjesi: i went into debian/, edited changelog.in, and put 0.9.3 instead of @versionwhatever@, and saved it as changelog. (without the .in). then did the same with files.in.  then, *out* of the coral directory (i.e. in the parent), i did "dpkg-source -b coral-0.9.3"
02:18	<beerockxs>	it's dual dvi, and the CRT is connected via a dvi-vga adapter
02:18	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: what am i looking for in nvidia-settings? nothing looks out of the ordinary
02:18	<RandomizeR>	everything looks like it's supposed to work, but it doesn't
02:18	<LjL>	pjesi: i somehow suspect that editing those files manually wasn't what they had in mind, but i don't know what tool is supposed to be used :)
02:18	<trol0s>	Huffalump: I don't think we're looking at the same client.. this small one only has three tabs, Download, Upload and Events
02:18	<delire>	beerockxs: ahah, i've experienced problems with this on a projector once.
02:18	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: open terminal and write nvidia-settings
02:18	<delire>	beerockxs: paste your xorg.conf
02:18	<ytsestef>	chowmeined: workarounds for what?
02:18	<Dave123>	our install fest will be fun today....  we burned 30 copies of ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04 was just released and the servers are getting hit hard
02:18	<SoftIce>	hello? nobody use vservers, what is the story with vserver + ubuntu feisty?
02:18	<Saelynh>	bonjour
02:19	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: not having to wait 3 minutes for every lvm partition i make
02:19	<ubunt1>	chowmeined: try gparted
02:19	<RandomizeR>	yeah, that works, and i get the nvidia settings dialog, and i checked all the options, nothing out of the ordinary
02:19	<ytsestef>	chowmeined: the release notes suggest that you just wait and everthing will be alright ;)
02:19	<beerockxs>	delire: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16797/
02:19	<Huffalump>	trol0s, sorry, I see that now. Must be new in Feisty, I never saw it in Edgy.  Yeah, I don't see any config options there... probably a line command thing.
02:19	<ajehuk>	ataylor - the error about the final newline is fairly self explanitory - just add a new line to the bottom of /etc/fstab.  your first issue we can resolve too - if you could post the output of 'sudo fstab -l'  and thecontents of /etc/fstab into a pastebin
02:19	<delire>	ytsestef: i don't know what to suggest. can you try to play an mp3 on the commandline with 'play file.mp3'?
02:19	<chowmeined>	ubunt1: there is no gparted in text mode installer
02:19	<jonah>	velko, am i ok doing that from DSL?
02:19	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: yes but.. im impatient...
02:19	<ubunt1>	chowmeined try gui mode
02:20	<beerockxs>	delire: the 2nd head device is just there to get rid of a warning, it doesn't actually do anything
02:20	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: and i generally make 8-10 partitions
02:20	<barravince>	hi how i can upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04?
02:20	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: oh well..
02:20	<[Jonne] >	i want to upgrade to feisty, but the button to upgrade to feisty is gone in upgrade-manager. How do i get it back?
02:20	<pjesi>	LjL: ok I will try
02:20	<chowmeined>	ubunt1: gui mode doesnt support lvm
02:20	<trol0s>	Huffalump: hehe yeah that's what I was thinking as well.. thanks anyways tho ; )
02:20	<velko>	jonah, yes. every live cd will do it. the point is to get write access to /etc/passwd
02:20	<cherva>	LjL: no luck
02:20	<Huffalump>	trol0s, so I'd have to recommend using a new client.  There's qTorrent (which I don't use), BitTornado (which was the Edgy default) and kTorrent (which I use even though It requires using the KDE libraries).
02:20	<ytsestef>	chowmeined: heh, guess you have to be patient for once!
02:20	<JoeUK>	I'm having problems getting desktop effects working. I'm using Feisty and an ATI graphics card. Desktop fx hasnt worked since i enabled restricted drivers.
02:20	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: guess so
02:20	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: in what version of UBuntu are you
02:20	<jonah>	velko, thanks i'll give it a go
02:20	<RandomizeR>	feisty, clean install
02:20	<trol0s>	Huffalump: someone should port over uTorrent : )
02:21	<ubunt1>	chowmeined: then that is bad.
02:21	<thirdalbum>	I have a question: There's a script that I want to add to my startup sequence on Edgy, so it will run before Xorg attempts to start. How might I do this? Thanks in advance if anyone knows :-)
02:21	<Huffalump>	trol0s, yes they should.  ktorrent is the closest, which is why I use it.
02:21	<chowmeined>	ubunt1: what is bad?
02:21	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: it worked out of the box, but when i tried installing the nvidia drivers to get hardware acceleration, this happened
02:21	<Kohlgarten>	hello everybody. Is is possible to use network-manager with feisty and a RaLink 2500 wireless card?
02:21	<ytsestef>	delire: this is unfortunately an amarok related problem, mp3 and flac are playing without a hitch in any other app
02:21	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: and the same problem was there on edgy, but i thought it was messed up that's why i did a clean install
02:21	<cherva>	LjL: same GLX error
02:21	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: hmmm,go to systems then administration and restricted drivers manager
02:21	<scanf>	so, can I use a 'unitialized' symbol from another module to resolve the driDispatchRemapTable symbol in /usr/X11R6/lib/libOSMesa.so.4?
02:21	<trol0s>	Huffalump: I saw it was meant for the KDE desktop.. is it much work installing those libraries? worth it for just kTorrent?
02:22	<LjL>	cherva: what was the error there precisely?
02:22	<ubunt1>	chowmeined: that it don't supprt gui
02:22	<delire>	beerockxs: are you sure that the second monitor does 1152x864? also you might want to look into the Dont Zoom option.
02:22	<JoeUK>	RandomizeR: what problem are you having?
02:22	<delire>	ytsestef: right. perhaps there's an amarok channel?
02:22	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: it has one entry, NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver
02:22	<cherva>	LjL not shure whait i'll make it again :)
02:22	<beerockxs>	delire: as I said, the setup is working fine at the correct resolutions in gnome, only in gdm is it messed up
02:22	<ytsestef>	yep, there is. a channel that no-one answers , hahaah

02:23	<ytsestef>	delire: that's a pity because i tried kubuntu and amarok is working great. the thing is i dont like kubuntu (or KDE in general)
02:23	<LjL>	pjesi, i hate to do this but
02:23	<RandomizeR>	JoeUK: nvidia driver doesn't work.. GeForece 5200, feisty; http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16796/ <- xorg.0.log

02:23	<JoeUK>	its not letting me do desktop effects
02:24	<Patric2>	hey guys I have fresh installed feisty last night and I now have a few issues I would like to fix, when I log out my screen hangs? it just stays blank I then have to hold down the power button to turn the laptop off?? I hate that
02:24	<InFlux>	Hi guys, I need a bit of help, I install Windows Vista first, and then 7.04. Grub did not install correctly. I have edited the menu.lst and got Windows to load OK. However, when I try to load Linux it gives error 22. The question is how to I know which drive and partition 7.04 installed itself on?
02:24	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: and glxinfo says direct rendering is enabled too
02:24	<pjesi>	LjL: I tried alien before I joined the channel
02:24	<xukun_>	I cant seem to install feisty, I get green/yellow screen at the last stage when it should start X. I have nvidia 5200 card with dual video and all this while using the boot cd
02:24	<ytsestef>	JoeUK: do you have the opensource drivers installed or the proprietary ones?
02:24	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: and restricted driver is enabled and status "in use"
02:24	<JoeUK>	proprietary i belive
02:24	<JoeUK>	the ones from restricted drivers
02:24	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: ok, it seems that one of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.*inst is calling update-fonts-dir incorrectly right?  I can't find the line that tries to use it incorrectly
02:25	<ytsestef>	JoeUK: these drivers do not work with AIGLX, you have to either install XGL, or the opensource drivers
02:25	<InFlux>	Vista is installed on (hd0,0)
02:25	<JoeUK>	how do i install the opensource drivers?
02:25	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: if u look at the end of the xorg log file (http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16796/), u'll see the line saying that it encountered too many errors
02:25	<delire>	beerockxs: ahah yikes, i didn't read that distinction. i have no idea why gdm is doing this. are there some gdm session files that contain screen geometry state that could be cleaned out.

02:26	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: i see it
02:26	<velko>	InFlux, instead of guessing look this information up using something like partition magic or the ubuntu partitioning tool
02:26	<ytsestef>	joeUK: they're copied when you install ubuntu, which means you just have to switch to them, by tweaking /etc/X11/xorg.conf
02:26	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: but it encouter 8 agp
02:26	<kbrooks>	velko, there is a good alt to part magic
02:26	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: moment.
02:26	<mwe>	RandomizeR: paste xorg.conf
02:26	<delire>	ytsestef: i don't use amarok so can't help there sorry. good luck. it sounds to me like amarok expects a kde related sound service to exist that doesn't, or is being overridden by another..
02:26	<RandomizeR>	mwe: ok
02:26	<sivaji_2009>	jrib : u r correct it is /var/lib/dpkg/info/xfonts-scalable.postinst just now i removed this corrupted file now  dpkg is alright thank you
02:27	<Patric2>	hey guys I have fresh installed feisty last night and I now have a few issues I would like to fix, when I log out my screen hangs? it just stays blank I then have to hold down the power button to turn the laptop off?? I hate that...
02:27	<Huffalump>	trol0s, unless your system is ancient, yes its worth it (I end up using a few other K-apps too, but ktorrent was the first and well worth it)
02:27	<kbrooks>	velko, gnome partition editor - aka gparted
02:27	<kbrooks>	!gparted
02:27	<JoeUK>	ytsestef: could you guide me through it? pvt so not to flood?
02:27	<ubotu>	GParted is is a !GUI partitioning program. Type  sudo apt-get install gparted  in a console to install it - A GParted "live" CD is available at http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
02:27	<cherva>	LjL: there is the xorg.0.log
02:27	<ajehuk>	InFlux - when you edited your menu.lst to get windows working I assume you did it with a live CD, if so can you use the live CD again, grab the output of fdisk -l and the content of menu.list and paste bin them? - also it would bee good if you could mount your / or /boot filesystems and add the output of /s (of /boot) to that pastebin...
02:27	<ytsestef>	delire: thanks for the try!

02:27	<velko>	kbrooks, thank you. could you point InFlux in this direction please?
02:27	<pjesi>	LjL: did it build a .deb in your case? I just have a .dsc and an tar.gz archive

02:27	<kbrooks>	InFlux, see message from ubotu
02:27	<RandomizeR>	oops, sry
02:27	<LjL>	pjesi: no, it did the same. building a .deb involves more steps, i'm trying, but honestly i'm mostly going by trial and failure (and half-following !packaging)
02:28	<InFlux>	velko, will gparted tell me what partition 7.04 is on? I can mount the the partition off the live CD, but I looked everywhere and I can find the parition info. like ie: hd2,4
02:28	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: wait, but that file probably needs to do something to correctly configure the package
02:28	<Huffalump>	trol0s - after ktorrent, the psychological barrier was broken.  frankly the KDE libs aren't resource heavy, so.... I ended up with some little games and other misc. rift raft.
02:28	<bderwent>	mwe: nope, I had to boot from the livecd

02:29	<mwe>	bderwent: good

02:29	<Hess>	Morning All.
02:29	<SFA_AOK>	hey, I have an Edgy install, with /home on its own partition. I want to install Feisty from the CD but am nervous that when the installer asks for a user's details and passwords, if i enter the username i have on my edgy system that it'll overwrite my home directory - can anyone advise me if this will/won't happen?
02:29	<cherva>	LjL: I tryed even without it no luck
02:29	<mwe>	bderwent: is the ubuntu partition mounted and mounted read/write?
02:29	<McScruff>	i want to try mandriva with mettise on kde, do i need the full 4gb dvd or can i just get the kde cdrom?
02:29	<Steil>	my cpu isn't really under any load....but its stuck at its highest clock speed (I have an AMD Athlon XP-M) under edgy it would only goto the highest clock speed under load and otherwise it'd be at half speed
02:29	<Steil>	any ideas?
02:30	<Huffalump>	trol0s, yuck.  I've had that on Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows.  uTorrent taught me to avoid Azureus whenever possible.
02:30	<linoleum>	I would like to know : is there a fixed package of nvidia-glx-new to work withe the 8800GTX now, or do we still need to do the wfb.so symlink workaround ?
02:30	<rnd_>	SAF_AOK: I have similar concern
02:30	<bderwent>	mwe: yes, the partition is mounted
02:30	<rampmike>	Hey guys. installed feisty yesterday. was fine. booted this morning and my window manager is not working. all apps have no frame around them....
02:30	<cherva>	LjL: i have to go out when i come back i'll see if you are here to continue thank for the help man
02:30	<BeBraw>	i managed to install feisty (amd64 version) but when i boot, it gives just blank screen. what could be the reason?
02:30	<mwe>	bderwent: I have to go for a few minutes but chroot is the keyword. I'll help you when I get back ...
02:30	<LjL>	cherva: anyway the key there is dlopen: /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1: undefined symbol: _nv000043gl
02:30	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: at least keep an eye on bug 107687 for a proper fix
02:30	<delire>	McScruff: see #mandriva
02:30	<LjL>	cherva: find out what package is offending, and try reinstalling it
02:30	<bderwent>	mwe: alright I'll see what I can figure out
02:30	<InFlux>	velko, good info! I'll boot of gparted and see if it helps. Thanks :)
02:30	<yachi>	hello
02:31	<cherva>	LjL: how apt-get install libGLcore ?
02:31	<ytsestef>	JoeUK: unfortunately I am no linux expert... sorry. the only thing i can tell you is open the xorg.conf file as root (sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf) and go to the device section and change the line "driver" from "fglrx" to "ati", then save the file and restart X by pressing control+alt+backspace. when you login again you have the opensource drivers running, which should enable you to use aiglx
02:31	<LjL>	cherva: no - well unsurprisingly, the package containing that file is nvidia-glx
02:31	<trol0s>	Huffalump: hehe I know, I don't really like it.. but at least it's familiar and don't require major operations :)
02:31	<Hess>	Anyone know off the top of there heads how to get sound to come out on the usb headset instead of the speakers?
02:31	<broyles>	i know this going to sound like a stupid question, but how do i get firefox to use the backspace key to go back a page..., it usually does that but in ubuntu it seems to just go up the page?
02:31	<JoeUK>	ok ty
02:31	<sivaji_2009>	jrib may i know what is the need of that file
02:31	<cherva>	LjL: WTF
02:31	<mwe>	bderwent: where is your ubuntu hdd partition mounted?
02:31	<Huffalump>	trol0s - bet you a nickel that Azureus takes at least twice or more resource than ktorrent.  Probably 5 x.
02:31	<sivaji_2009>	jrib may i know what is the use of that file
02:31	<LjL>	cherva: remember the URL to your sources.list paste?
02:31	<zbrown>	broyles: i know what you're talking about, I'm not sure how to do it either
02:31	<yachi>	i am using ubuntu 7.04 beta. is there anything to do to "upgrade" to the final ?
02:31	<ytsestef>	delire: thanks for the link. I am investigating... :)
02:31	<cherva>	LjL: at some point i'll move my /home and forrmat that b***h
02:32	<clever>	Huffalump: i perfer utorrent or btdownloadcurses
02:32	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: the file is used by the package maintainer to run commands after the install so that the package cna work correctly
02:32	<Huffalump>	trol0s - ktorrent looks remarkably like utorrent
02:32	<broyles>	zbrown, its annoying me lol
02:32	<SFA_AOK>	broyles - there's an option you can set in about:config, can't remember which one but googling for "firefox backspace about:config" should bring something up
02:32	<askar>	How can I reinstall ubuntu without having a seperate /home partition?
02:32	<Huffalump>	clever, utorrent on ubuntu?  do tell!
02:32	<broyles>	SFA_AOK, thanks :)
02:32	<bderwent>	mwe: /media/disk
02:32	<mwe>	bderwent: open a terminal and get root access (sudo -i)
02:32	<delire>	clever: btdownloadcurses is preferred here also
02:32	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: nothing very useful in that link, they all say it works fine for them, so what's the problem with my setting? :-(

02:33	<Healot>	no, was referring to beryl info
02:33	<rellik>	ubunt1, yeah.  in VLC they play fine..  I am thinking maybe it's because there is a problem when two programs try to play sound at the same time (and vlc releases the sound card between songs, but amarok doesn't I guess)
02:33	<Huffalump>	clever, I found ktorrent is very utorrent-like.  Low resource and very familiar.  The only thing was to get over the psychological barrier of "oh noez!! kde libs!"
02:33	<JoeUK>	ive just done that. it hasnt made a difference. the composite extension is still unavailable
02:34	<clever>	lol
02:34	<broyles>	clever, thank SFA_AOK he/she pointed me to that
02:34	<mwe>	bderwent: good type 'mount -o bind /proc /media/disk/proc' tell me if it complains. if not it succeeded
02:34	<ubunt1>	rellik then use vlc
02:34	<chowmeined>	askar: im not sure why you want to merge it though, generally it seems to be more flexible to have these on different partitions
02:34	<SFA_AOK>	i hear that utorrent works pretty well through wine
02:34	<clever>	i switched my desktop to kde
02:34	<Woody_>	how can i re-install the Arabic language on my Firefox? the text im getting is somehow distorted and hard to read.

02:34	<Huffalump>	clever, I've thought about it, but in the end I prefer Gnome
02:34	<ubunt1>	rellik ?
02:34	<ubunt1>	reliik ok
02:34	<kbrooks>	i'm bored, so is there a GRUB manager, so to speak, that will edit the menu.lst for me?
02:34	<chowmeined>	askar: if you are using lvm you can grow the ext3 root partition if you want
02:34	<clever>	most of the progs on my desktop where kde based
02:34	<clever>	so i just switched the whole thing over
02:34	<ubunt1>	rellik,waht can i say you,now vlc is more fast.\
02:34	<penns>	Can anyone help with mdadm in Feisty? I am in the middle of an upgrade via apt (update tool wouldn't work) and it is prompting for the array needed to start the root filesystem. I have three arrays, md0 (swap), md1 (/boot), and md2 (/). But it won't accept md2 as an answer.
02:35	<bderwent>	mwe: it's saying no such file or directory
02:35	<Huffalump>	clever, well that's a reason I can understand.  Right now, I have a few apps but not many.  Perhaps if that continues.... but so far, it doesn't seem to be.
02:35	<rnd_>	Trying again: how do I install feisty into another partition? I have tried but installation process exited (I have no idea if did the job or not) and ubuntu doesnt boot (old FC4 booted ok)
02:35	<Tex_Arcana>	I need to access xorg.conf from the command line (GDM not working)
02:35	<rellik>	ubunt1, "vlc is more fast"???  it's not a speed issue at all..
02:35	<mwe>	bderwent: huh
02:35	<clever>	ahh
02:35	<cherva>	LjL: no luck ok bye bye for now see you later man
02:35	<clever>	ive also recently found a bug in my laptop kernel
02:35	<ubunt1>	rellik but it is configured to work for some format.
02:35	<cherva>	LjL: thanks anyway
02:35	<mwe>	ls /media/disk. do you see somthing that may look like your ubunut intall?
02:35	<clever>	if i used too much bandwidth on my rtl network catc
02:35	<clever>	the system would lockup solid
02:35	<bderwent>	mwe: yeah I'm pretty much stumped too
02:35	<clever>	not even sysrq would respond
02:35	<ytsestef>	delire: it was way too simple. it worked! woohoo mp3 AND flac!
02:36	<trol0s>	Huffalump: yeah but how much memory goes to the KDE libraries? :P how does it work anyways.. are they just dormant in the background or is it 40 processes running? :P
02:36	<LjL>	cherva: later, hope you get it fixed
02:36	<ytsestef>	delire: thanks a lot for the link.
02:36	<mwe>	 bderwent *ubuntu* install even
02:36	<cherva>	LJL: THE FORMAT POWER FIX'S ALL
02:36	<Tom47>	Tex_Arcana: sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
02:36	<Wespe>	hi, can someone help me to get the sound to work with feisty? it's onboard sound, asu m2n-e sli. I already tried the NFORCE driver, but it would not compile a new kernel. please help
02:36	<LjL>	cherva: ...
02:36	<rellik>	ubunt1, ummm, ok..
02:36	<cherva>	LjL : :)
02:36	<Huffalump>	trol0s, meh.  it's nothing.  featherweight.  I think there's a stigma left from back when people used sub-Ghz processors with 16 mb of RAM... shared between a video card.  If you follow me...
02:36	<cherva>	LjL: bye
02:37	<delire>	ytsestef:  :)
02:37	<ubunt1>	rellik how you want.
02:37	<Hor|zon>	heh lots of people I know mistake processes beginning with k as kde processes
02:37	<Hor|zon>	when the k stands for kernel
02:37	<Hor|zon>	>.>
02:37	<ubunt1>	hmm kde is not working on UBUntu 7
02:37	<Huffalump>	trol0s - ktorrent is using 0.2% of memory... the rest don't even show up on the radar
02:37	<bderwent>	mwe: /media/disk is my normal root directory
02:38	<trol0s>	Huffalump: hehe I'm new to linux so I don't know what sizes we're talking here =)
02:38	<rellik>	ubunt1, just use gnome..  it is faster
02:38	<mwe>	bderwent: bot /media/disk/proc is not present? only usr bin and so on?
02:38	<psycop>	Hello
02:38	<trol0s>	Huffalump: ah hehe okey.. sounds tempting then!
02:38	<ubunt1>	rellik i want to try kde,they say that make all service auto.
02:38	<babo>	congratulations guys, feisty is already looking great. And it's a big improvement on edgy ( from where I'm sitting anyway ) ... :-)
02:38	<Huffalump>	trol0s - I'm loading a new torrent, so it jumped as high as 2.4% maximum.... on a 1 gig of memory.  And it'll fall back down again once it's done scanning and all.
02:38	<Tex_Arcana>	Tom47 I have that bit but I'm a bit punchy after being up all night and can't remember ahh I am punchy just remembered.
02:39	<Huffalump>	trol0s - 2 gigs of memory, pardon me
02:39	<rellik>	ubunt1, kde is not configured for ubuntu just use gnome
02:39	<jonah>	velko, hi it didnt work, first it said my drmc file would be ignored then i got an error saying "Your session lasted less than 10 seconds. If you have not logged out yourself this could mean installation problem or out of diskspace" then i get a login screen again
02:39	<ubunt1>	rellik,but it can be configured.
02:39	<rnd_>	can anybody who recently installed Feisty tell what should be after package installations? thanks!
02:39	<Tom47>	!hello | psycop
02:39	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about hello - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
02:39	<rellik>	ubunt1, nevermind..  I was making a point about your comments
02:39	<Huffalump>	ubunt1 - what do you want to do with KDE that you think Gnome is inferior at?  You may be right, but what specifically are you after?
02:39	<jrib>	rnd_: enjoy your new OS
02:39	<penns>	Can anyone help with mdadm in Feisty? I am in the middle of an upgrade via apt (update tool wouldn't work) and it is prompting for the array needed to start the root filesystem. I have three arrays, md0 (swap), md1 (/boot), and md2 (/). But it won't accept md2 as an answer. It will accept /dev/.static/dev/md2 but then warns this array isn't listed in mdadm.conf (which has /dev/md2).
02:39	<Daboone72>	Is there a version of Ubuntu in which the RAID1/LVM combination installs successfully?
02:39	<trol0s>	Huffalump: so that'll be 40+MB then eh? hehe.. 2% of 2 gig ; )
02:39	<mwe>	bderwent: ?
02:40	<bderwent>	mwe: yeah, it's there
02:40	<psycop>	I have a problem installing ubuntu 64bit, dont know if anyone else had some problems(keep in mind im totally new to this)- When i boot the ubuntu cd and select install ubuntu it says "kernel alive" and then goes into black screen
02:40	<psycop>	anyone know a solution to that?
02:40	<rnd_>	jrib: how? the install process just ended.
02:40	<mwe>	bderwent: ls /proc. it's there as well?
02:40	<Huffalump>	ubunt1 - You can just install KDE and XFCE via Synaptic.  Then, when you login you can specify which X windows you want during that session.  This way, you can try them all, if you want to just experiment.
02:40	<rnd_>	jrib: and Feisty doesnt boot
02:40	<velko>	jonah, my fault. you changed the uid for the user and the files in your /home directory belong to a different user (maybe with uid 1001)
02:40	<nielsm>	ok, quick one, what packages do i need to get gcc working on a fresh feisty install? (gcc is there, it just fails to link things, even the most basic "return 0" program, complainint about missing crtl.o)
02:40	<jonah>	velko, then when i view details the error seems to be this " xfce4-session: unable to access file /home/billy/.ICEauthority: Permission denied
02:40	<Huffalump>	trol0s - what is your Azureus eating up? ;)
02:40	<spikeb>	niekko, try build-essential
02:40	<jrib>	rnd_: did the install complete?
02:41	<jonah>	velko, should i boot damn small back up again? how can i fix this?
02:41	<idefixx>	anyone know the reason why compiz depends on the ubuntu-desktop? that kind of sucks i wanna get rid of it and feisty forces me to keep it :(
02:41	<BeBraw>	psycop: i have the same problem here
02:41	<bderwent>	mwe: figured it out, whatever 'mount -o bind /proc /media/disk/proc' was I just did it
02:41	<ubunt1>	Huffalump: in version 6.10 it work,but thanks i will see what is the problem.
02:41	<rnd_>	I do not know - it installed packages and then nothing =- just that test desktop
02:41	<velko>	jonah, you have to change the ownership of all the files and directories in your /home directory so they belong to the user with uid 1000
02:41	<Jestre>	psycop: SATA drive?
02:41	<ubunt1>	rellik: no problem.
02:41	<velko>	jonah, yes
02:41	<mwe>	bderwent: so it mounted?
02:41	<trol0s>	Huffalump: hehe it'll probably use a lot more.. don't have it installed tho :P
02:41	<rnd_>	jrib:  I do not know - it installed packages and then nothing =- just that test desktop
02:41	<psycop>	SATAII-300 yes
02:41	<nielsm>	spikeb: thanks, seems to be right
02:41	<bderwent>	mwe: yes, it is mounted
02:41	<jrib>	idefixx: compiz doesn't depend on ubuntu-desktop, do you mean the other direction?
02:41	<Jestre>	psycop: I'm having the same issue, and seems to be related to the SATA drives
02:41	<Huffalump>	trol0s - when I see your timeout from irc, then I'll know you've installed it
02:41	<spikeb>	niekko, you're most welcome :)
02:41	<velko>	jonah, let me explain it so that you know what happened and how to deal with the problem
02:42	<mwe>	bderwent: chroot /media/disk /bin/bash. then source /etc/profile
02:42	<jonah>	velko, thanks
02:42	<rnd_>	jrib: that is why I am asking what should happen after step 7
02:42	<idefixx>	jrib: yes sry.
02:42	<mwe>	bderwent: tell me if it works without complaints
02:42	<jrib>	!ubuntu-desktop >	idefixx    (idefixx, see the private message from ubotu)
02:42	<psycop>	Jestre i also have 8800 GTS graphics card, can it be that? heard it had some compatibility issues
02:42	<trol0s>	Huffalump: lol :D
02:42	<velko>	jonah, the file system recognizes the objects (files, directories) by numbers, which are mapped to user names
02:42	<ytsestef>	had anyone any luck with getting video handled by aiglx? (that involves wobbling and opacity effects in the video window and being viewable in the cube). It has something to do with opengl output plugins. but when i enable the opengl output plugin. the player application terminates.
02:43	<jonah>	velko, ok
02:43	<idefixx>	jrib: well if you say its safe - thx
02:43	<jrib>	rnd_: I see
02:43	<Jestre>	psycop: It's possible, not sureon that.  But I've seen a bunch of folks, myself included, where the screen goes black and dies
02:43	<velko>	jonah, the first user in ubuntu has user id 1000. the second 1001 etc
02:43	<KnightGeek>	Hi, I'm having a problem booting from the Ubuntu live CD
02:43	<jonah>	velko, so i need to somehow alter all the files and directories to 1000?
02:43	<Jestre>	psycop: turn off quiet and splash options and see if it dies at the ata stuff
02:43	<isidoro>	hi
02:43	<velko>	jonah, yes
02:44	<bderwent>	mwe: it's not letting me, even as root
02:44	<KnightGeek>	yah, it hangs at the splash
02:44	<jonah>	velko, but how will i ever change everything from DSL?
02:44	<KnightGeek>	when I boot
02:44	<psycop>	where do i do that jestre?
02:44	<mwe>	bderwent: not letting you? what's the error?
02:44	<velko>	jonah, i'll check if the "chown" command can use uids instead of names. sec please
02:44	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: how much time do you wait, before you consider it hanged?
02:44	<miranda82>	hello guys
02:44	<Jestre>	KnightGeek: SATA drives?
02:44	<jonah>	velko, i've got a shell up in DSL, thanks a lot for your help
02:44	<FreeNet>	hi all the, 7.04's desktop effect is COOL, but only these 2 effect?
02:44	<hansen>	Hey guys, trying to get a hold of someone that uses USB2.0 disc for storing...
02:45	<FreeNet>	hi all the, 7.04's desktop effect is COOL, woopy and cube?
02:45	<miranda82>	is playground-xmms broken in feisty? it does not seem to work here...
02:45	<xukun_>	I cant seem to install feisty, I get green/yellow screen at the last stage when it should start X. I have nvidia 5200 card with dual video and all this while using the boot cd
02:45	<xukun_>	is there is no one here who can help with this probleem,
02:45	<Jestre>	psycop: Hit F6 on the screen, and remove those two words from the startup line
02:45	<Dmitri_P>	hi, since updating ubuntu to 7.04 my TV-Card isn't recognized; the driver is loaded, but kaffeine says that i haven't got a tv card :(
02:45	<hansen>	when importing into amarok it takes Several hours... tips?
02:45	<RARCA>	Howdy
02:45	<isidoro>	why feisty set my ata disk as /dev/sda?? it is not a scasii
02:45	<psycop>	ok
02:45	<BeBraw>	psycop: do you have some wlan dongle?
02:45	<KnightGeek>	who knows how to fix boot hangups?
02:45	<mwe>	bderwent: ?
02:45	<bderwent>	mwe: "chroot: cannot change root directory to /media/disk: Operation not permitted"
02:45	<Huffalump>	patience, xukun_ :)
02:45	<jrib>	!uuid >	isidoro    (isidoro, see the private message from ubotu)
02:45	<redguy>	hansen: set up a real database (mysql, postgres) to hold track info perhaps ?
02:45	<velko>	jonah, yes it works. you can change the owner with this command "chown -R 1000:1000 /home/jonah"
02:46	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: i ask you about the time cause it is more likely some devices won't respond when being probed, and the system has to wait for it to timeout before moving onto the next one.
02:46	<jonah>	velko, imy hardrive with xubuntu on is mounted as hda1
02:46	<mwe>	bderwent: type mount. is /media/disk mounted rw?
02:46	<hansen>	redguy, Is that alot faster? i mean, will it take several hours there to?
02:46	<psycop>	Jestre i get Buffer I/O errlr k
02:46	<RARCA>	Some help please....  having problems accessing the web, but can access chat (Gaim).  How do I reinstall Firefox to make sure that is not the problem?
02:46	<ytsestef>	ok, whatever...
02:46	<xukun_>	Huffalump, I know but I,m waiting for a while, about 30m, but I can wait longer maybe
02:46	<psycop>	buffer I/O error on device sr0*
02:46	<jonah>	velko, so do i need to put hda1/home/jonah?
02:46	<redguy>	hansen: should be considerably faster
02:46	<hansen>	And, will mysql take alot of CPU-time? :)
02:46	<mrmonday>	how much HDD space does a typical feisty install take up?
02:46	<jrib>	!ipv6 >	RARCA    (RARCA, see the private message from ubotu)
02:46	<hansen>	redguy, ok, will try that, universe i guess(?)
02:46	<ytsestef>	mrmonday: mine took up 2gb
02:47	<bobo>	is there a way to mount drives with out going to the command line yet?
02:47	<Huffalump>	xukun_ Sorry, I hadn't seen you before, my bad.  So, you have already installed?  Or you are just trying to get the Live CD to work?
02:47	<mwe>	hansen: not if it's just sitting there
02:47	<velko>	jonah, you have to use the correct path to your home directory. maybe /hda1/home/jonah yes
02:47	<redguy>	hansen: sqlite sucks when there's lot of data...
02:47	<hansen>	mwe, It will hold trackinfo of about 40.000 songs
02:47	<mwe>	hansen: if it's not busy it wont take any CPU time. only som RAM
02:47	<hansen>	redguy, Sound great =)
02:47	<mrmonday>	ytsestef, do you think I could get away with a 3Gig HDD then?
02:47	<mwe>	hansen: still
02:47	<hansen>	mwe, Aight
02:47	<Tom47>	!ipv6 >	Tom47
02:47	<redguy>	hansen: not sure, but both should be in the main repos I suppose
02:47	<rnd_>	jrib: thanks for trying. Perhaps I will find some way. bye
02:48	<velko>	jonah, and verify that it worked with "ls -l /hda1/home/jonah"
02:48	<ytsestef>	mrmonday: technically yes. using 2GB for the system, 512MB for the swap file and leaving you with 512 MB of space for your documents
02:48	<hansen>	redguy, Thanks mate =) will trying as-we-speak
02:48	<KnightGeek>	My computer hangs while booting Ubuntu from the CD. Can you help?
02:48	<jrib>	rnd_: gl, I don't know what the live cd does to install.  If you think it finished successfully, just describe the problem you have now
02:48	<bderwent>	mwe: yes it's mounted with read/write
02:48	<xukun_>	Huffalump, No not installed yet, I,m trying that when I boot the cd I get that problem
02:48	<mwe>	bderwent: and you can't chroot /media/disk /bin/bash? really odd
02:48	<hansen>	mysql-server, admin, should be the things i need, right?
02:49	<KnightGeek>	It hangs ath the splash screen
02:49	<rnd_>	jrib: I do not know - there were no problems - the window closed and I was left in the same test desktop
02:49	<Jestre>	KnightGeek: Join the club
02:49	<hansen>	played with it before, but not in ubuntu, only w32
02:49	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: How much time do you wait before considering the system hanged??
02:49	<mwe>	bderwent: maybe it's too badly screwed
02:49	<sickofwireles1>	hi, could someone please tell me - how do I switch between language inputs?
02:49	<mrmonday>	ytsestef, thanks
02:49	<penns>	Can anyone help with mdadm in Feisty? I am in the middle of an upgrade via apt (update tool wouldn't work) and it is prompting for the array needed to start the root filesystem. I have three arrays, md0 (swap), md1 (/boot), and md2 (/). But it won't accept md2 as an answer. It will accept /dev/.static/dev/md2 but then warns this array isn't listed in mdadm.conf (which has /dev/md2).
02:49	<Huffalump>	xukun_ I may or may not be able to help.  Normally, when you get a video card problem, there will be an error message.  Xorg failed blah blah.  What did that say?
02:49	<velko>	jonah, if dsl have user with uid 1000 named "dsl" you will see the files owned by the user "dsl". this is ok
02:49	<ytsestef>	mrmonday: :)
02:49	<rnd_>	jrib: but bootloader has not been installed apparently

02:49	<mwe>	bderwent: Is it a somewhat fresh install?
02:49	<miranda82>	is playground-xmms broken in feisty? it does not seem to work here...
02:49	<bderwent>	mwe: I've gotten really screwy errors, can I install from the cd and still save the files?
02:49	<KnightGeek>	It just stuck at the splash
02:49	<Lopi>	hmmm  how can i show you screen from desktop with my probem?
02:49	<os2mac>	Daverocks: sorry :(

02:51	<kael_>	hello
02:51	<Huffalump>	os2mac, they can tell you in #openoffice.org
02:51	<mwe>	bderwent: do you have a lot of files there? if not just reinstall I guess. otherwise rename /media/disk/home to preserve it. wipe everything else and reinstall
02:51	<isidoro>	ok
02:51	<kael_>	oups, wrong chaanel :p

02:51	<rnd_>	jrib: in fact I need my old FC4 to boot too... and it seems /boot on Feisty side is missing quite a lot of things
02:51	<bderwent>	mwe: I'll figure things out eventually. I think I'm going to try a fresh install
02:52	<KnightGeek>	I have an Athlon X2 should I try 64 bit Ubuntu?
02:52	<rnd_>	jrib: do you know how many files should be in /boot ?
02:52	<jonah>	velko, sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/hda1/home/billy  is giving the error: No such file or directory....
02:52	<jrib>	rnd_: hmm, then my suggestion would be to either try to reinstall (but run the installer from a terminal so you can get some output) or try the alternate cd
02:52	<koaL``>	can someone help me install php please :)?
02:52	<Daboone72>	rnd_ me too it booted using my 2.617 kernel and so was missing drivers which means I can't get networking going to fix it

02:53	<KnightGeek>	what is the group's attitude toward 64 bit?
02:53	<isidoro>	I am not understanding why my /dev/hda1 is now in feisty /dev/sda1???
02:53	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: you can try it, if you can cope with the lack o flash support in firefox 64bit ;)
02:53	<velko>	jonah, and what gives "ls -l /mnt/hda1/home/billy" ?
02:53	<blackest>	any idea where i would find a driver installed by a make install?
02:53	<KnightGeek>	oh
02:53	<xukun_>	Huffalump, I,m in console now, how can I find out what the problem of that green/yellow screen is?
02:53	<KnightGeek>	that sucks
02:53	<Huffalump>	Palantor, that's happened before on occassion.  You'll have to redownload.  Why so slow?
02:53	<Daboone72>	I don't think Feisty is final when it comes to RAID/LVM installs on alternate and since that is what alternate is mostly for it's not finished really
02:53	<KnightGeek>	I like my youtube
02:53	<Tom47>	os2mac maybe you could try EFnet #OpenOffice
02:53	<redguy>	isidoro: indeed, the new kernel has some device name changes because of reworked disk layer AFAIK
02:53	<psycop>	I keep getting "Buffer I/O error on device sr0, logical block #####"
02:53	<rnd_>	jrib: thanks. my installation misses grub
02:53	<psycop>	why is that?
02:53	<KnightGeek>	does it make it faster
02:54	<askar>	With command do I use to check if I have direct 3d support?
02:54	<KnightGeek>	to have 64 bit
02:54	<rnd_>	jrib: I will try to reinstall. Thanks!
02:54	<KnightGeek>	or more stabel
02:54	<Huffalump>	xukun_ so you are at the terminal prompt as root or ?
02:54	<isidoro>	redguy: but it is normal??
02:54	<Daverocks>	os2mac: it's slightly different to excel
02:54	<Saturisation>	hello
02:54	<xukun_>	Huffalump, yes
02:54	<jonah>	velko, that gives me drwx------ 2 1000   10000   4096 Apr 21 08:06 Desktop
02:54	<ferret>	askar: glxinfo | grep -i direct
02:54	<Palantor>	site i was able to get to from the Ubuntu screen gave around 15-22Kbs the whole time
02:54	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek, i know. i had 64bit ubuntu and switched to 32bit just because i missed my youtube. I noticed NO difference in terms of speed when i downgraded to 32bit. it only made it more compatible and stable
02:54	<Daverocks>	os2mac: "=SheetName.A1"
02:54	<jrib>	KnightGeek: you won't notice any speed difference with normal tasks
02:54	<KnightGeek>	ok
02:54	<miranda82>	is playground-xmms broken in feisty? it does not seem to work here...
02:54	<Daverocks>	os2mac: note the "." instead of the usual "!" in excel
02:55	<Huffalump>	xukun_ ok, nano /var/log/Xorg.0.log
02:55	<mrmonday>	os2mac, I might be able to
02:55	<Saturisation>	distribution upgrade fails at some package, can i just quit the app and run it again?
02:55	<KnightGeek>	well, that brings me back to my boot problem
02:55	<mrmonday>	* too late..
02:55	<velko>	jonah, strange. it seem as if it worked. your group id is very strange. i don't understand why you get the error message
02:55	<Huffalump>	xukun_ that is the log dump from the X windows trying to start.  Therein should be plenty of information which can help diagnose the problem.
02:55	<askar>	ferret: after i made something stupid with restricted manager I no longer have direct rendering..can you help me?
02:55	<psycop>	I keep getting "Buffer I/O error on device sr0, logical block #####" Anyone know why?
02:56	<xukun_>	Huffalump, ok I will take a look
02:56	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: i guess so. other distros using the same kernel do that boot hang? or is it an ubuntu exclusive feature?
02:56	<Huffalump>	xukun_ ideally, you would post that to a pastebin somewhere and then get help to solve whatever is the problem in your specific case.  However, I realize that may be difficult to do from the prompt ;)
02:56	<ferret>	askar: Uhh, probably not.  But if you upload your X log and configuration to a pastebin someone should be able to help
02:56	<redguy>	isidoro: http://www.beranger.org/index.php?article=2696
02:56	<KnightGeek>	I don't know I just built this rig
02:56	<velko>	jonah, are you sure it's 10000 and not 1000?
02:56	<ubunt1>	http://www.sexualityandu.ca/teens/what.aspx
02:56	<Hor|zon>	ytsestef: is there a reason you couldn't just run 32-bit firefox in 64-bit ubuntu and watch youtube that way?
02:56	<Huffalump>	xukun_ so, instead, see if you can find toward the end... where the problem was and what it was
02:56	<KnightGeek>	I could try knoppix
=== doc| is now known as docMuerto
02:56	<Huffalump>	ubuntu1 do not spam with porn!
02:56	<ubunt1>	KnightGeek: why knoppix
02:57	<jonah>	velko, it's 1000
02:57	<ubunt1>	Huffalump: that is not spam
02:57	<KnightGeek>	I have a CD lying around
02:57	<ubunt1>	Huffalump: this page tell what is sex
02:57	<velko>	jonah, ok. and what gives "ls -ld /mnt/hda1/home/billy" ?
02:57	<xukun_>	Huffalump, indeed
02:57	<ytsestef>	Hor|zon, i guess you can do that. but i switched to 32bit because i had other problems too
02:57	<MrWhammy>	hello, I am new to Linux, I've just installed Ubuntu 7.04 and I'm now trying to play M4A files using Rhytmbox. I have installed several gstreamer plugins, but I can't seem to find the right one... any help very much appreciated
02:57	<KnightGeek>	or would a distro like Fedora Core be better to test that
02:57	<ytsestef>	Hor|zon: i mean i never tried installing 32bit ffox
02:58	<jrib>	MrWhammy: tried double clicking on the m4a?
02:58	<askar>	Can someone help me getting direct rendering again???
02:58	<jonah>	velko, that gives me drwxr-xr-x  8  1000  1000
02:58	<MrWhammy>	jrib: not yet, no, will do so now :)
02:58	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: you can try switching to verbose mode during boot and see what makes it hang (i dont know the shortcut or the commandline option though)
02:58	<Hor|zon>	ytsestef: lol it's easy...there's even scripts to do it for you on the forums...and install flash 9 and java for it
02:58	<LjL>	pjesi: alright, i've somehow (how? no idea) managed to convince dpkg-buildpackage to actually try compiling the thing, but the errors are the same.
02:58	<psycop>	I keep getting "Buffer I/O error on device sr0, logical block #####" Anyone know why?
02:58	<KnightGeek>	ok
02:58	<Nickste>	When I boot live cd, my mouse and keyboard freeze. How do I fix this? (7.04)
02:58	<sirkism>	anyone body else use vlc to view vidoes on fawn?
02:58	<KnightGeek>	thanks
02:58	<velko>	jonah, cool. now you can reboot in ubuntu and it should work again
02:58	<Hor|zon>	ytsestef: personally the speed difference is huge for me so I'd never switch away from 64-bit
02:59	<askar>	I made something stupid with restricted manager and now I do not have direct rendering..
02:59	<askar>	here is my xorg.conf
02:59	<askar>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16808/
02:59	<askar>	Please help someone!
02:59	<pjesi>	LjL: I see
02:59	<KnightGeek>	thanks, I'll search forums for command and give it a try
02:59	<pjesi>	I guess it is a lost case
02:59	<dacoopsta>	/exit
02:59	<MulixX>	can anyone help me? why can't I watch movies from network ? it say's could not reach destination file
02:59	<compwiz18>	askar: ati or nvidia?
03:00	<Huffalump>	MulixX maybe the server is down?
03:00	<ytsestef>	Hor|zon: hahah, i asked for help here and no-one answered when I had that problem. the thing is i don't mind, because it made my desktop acceleration more stable and I really can notice no difference in terms of speed
03:00	<MulixX>	would someone like to connect to my desktop and solve the problem ?
03:00	<LjL>	pjesi: though, i see in the debian Depends: line for coral that it depends on Python "greater or equal to" version 2.3. i have 2.5 installed, what's your "apt-cache policy python"? it's quite likely that it does require 2.3, not "greater than"
03:00	<askar>	 compwiz18: intel
03:00	<MulixX>	no it's not down because i can see the movie list... song's etc
03:00	<Woody_>	how can i re-install the Arabic language on my Firefox? the text im getting is somehow distorted and hard to read?
03:00	<Huffalump>	MulixX maybe the file name is wrong?
03:00	<jonah>	velko, are you sure cos i didnt actually do anything... ok i'll try it
03:00	<compwiz18>	askar: so you shouldn't need restricted drivers... I think?
03:00	<MulixX>	no i's not .. if i copy it on my computer it works
=== K is now known as Clampdown
03:00	<Huffalump>	ok, good to know, MulixX
03:00	<chenrano2002>	who has the LAN installation OS using Ubuntu Server as boot and instllation Server?? I mean PXE netboot
03:00	<os2mac>	MrMonday: thanks I figured it out... it was actually pretty easy.
03:00	<MulixX>	but i want to watch movies directly from the server
03:00	<pjesi>	LjL: 2.4.3
03:01	<isidoro>	how I install 3d driver for my nividia... i have feisty
03:01	<velko>	jonah, it's strange that you get the error message. but the permissions are ok. if your new user have id 1000 it should work
03:01	<Huffalump>	MulixX what client are you using?
03:01	<MulixX>	ubuntu
03:01	<Stormx2>	Hmm...
03:01	<MulixX>	6.10
03:01	<LjL>	pjesi: that will explain why we get slightly different errors... see if you can install "python2.3", here on feisty it's not available at all
03:01	<Huffalump>	MulixX what video player?
03:01	<askar>	 compwiz18: no....but ati showed up in there and I clicked it..and then I could not get into X.. so i restored an old backup in panic and now no direct rendering

03:01	<MulixX>	Movie player from ubuntu
03:01	<delf0s>	Can anyone help... my fonts are way too big.. anyone know how to get them exactly like windows xp?
03:01	<MulixX>	Totem movie player
03:01	<MrWhammy>	jrib: that seems to have worked. live can be easy sometimes :)
03:01	<delf0s>	same font and everything
03:01	<LjL>	pjesi: (probably not, the bot says it isn't there)
03:01	<LjL>	!paste >	Stormx2    (Stormx2, see the private message from Ubotu)
03:01	<MulixX>	but the same happens with xmms
03:01	<velko>	jonah, you still there?
03:02	<stp2007>	Hi, where can I download a 32 bit distribution of Ubuntu?
03:02	<jonah>	velko, yup
03:02	<MulixX>	wanna connect to my desktop and see ?
03:02	<compwiz18>	askar: that might be a problem for you...hold on, let me look at your xorg.  could you give the URL again?
03:02	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, go to the preferences menu in the gnome menu bar applet and select fonts
03:02	<jonah>	velko, just rebooting other box into xubuntu to try it now
03:02	<velko>	jonah, delete everything in /tmp (/mnt/hda1/tmp)
03:02	<jrib>	stp2007: www.ubuntu.com  click download, dowload the i386 cd
03:02	<Huffalump>	MulixX, okay.  I do not use that player myself, so someone else will have to help you.  If there is a specific error message, you may want to reference it.  (Finally, if you cannot get a solution and you're willing to try something different, you may consider testing the same remote movie in VLC.)
03:02	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, you either want to change the font sizes liek that or change the dpi
03:02	<pjesi>	LjL: I am setting up vmware to try it on the "ideal" platform
03:02	<askar>	compwiz18: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16808/
03:02	<Hor|zon>	on that same dialog
03:02	<eztk>	huffalump: by the way, im trying this solution: http://www.ralree.info/2007/3/22/huge-mistake-in-ubuntu-feisty-fawn-herd-5
03:03	<Tex_Arcana>	My nvidia kernal modules don't match. I had a look at xorg.conf but found no place to reconfigure the kernal versions.
03:03	<delf0s>	Horizon: the dpi in linux is waaaay different than that of winxp
03:03	<Huffalump>	eztk, the title raises the hair on my neck
03:03	<eztk>	huffalump: ill let you know how im getting on. a nice chap over at #ubuntu-uk is helping out
03:03	<jonah>	velko, how come?
03:03	<flap>	pappappero
03:03	<jcath>	anyone successfully compile unh-scsi module on ubuntu 6.10?
03:03	<stp2007>	jrib, tried that. Tried the 'Standard personal computer (x86 architecture, PentiumTM, CeleronTM, AthlonTM, SempronTM)' option which doesn't seem to be correct. The other three options don't seem correct either.\
03:03	<LjL>	pjesi: if you type "python2.3", is it a command not found? on feisty, i do have python2.4, even though the package is 2.5
03:03	<MK_Mike>	Before i upgraded i had this really cool shell that drops down and is really usfull does anyone know the name of it?
03:03	<hansen>	hmm, redguy, I did not use the guide, but i did it the win32 way that i know and it works, but... it still freakishly slow
03:03	<Hor|zon>	delf0s: well you can change that...as for microsoft fonts...there's an mstruetype fonts package
03:03	<jcath>	I got lots of errors :(
03:04	<LjL>	pjesi: nevermind, there's actually a python2.4 package installed too
03:04	<pjesi>	LjL: I have python2.4 only as well
03:04	<velko>	jonah, debian deletes it on every reboot so it should be done by ubuntu too. but in order not to have dangling links with wrong permissions it is better to do it manually. i hope ubuntu will delete these files too
03:04	<Huffalump>	eztk, leave it to the brits - ha! ;)
03:04	<delf0s>	Where can I find that package?
03:04	<stp2007>	jrib, clarification. i downloaded ver 7.04, should I try 6.06LTS?
03:04	<redguy>	hansen: hmm, no other ideas then, sorry
03:04	<Stormx2>	Okay. Synaptic gave a seg fault while installing gnome-office componants. please look at this, it looks bad: http://pastebin.ca/451352 <-- the install process has frozen too...
03:04	<velko>	jonah, lets see :-)
03:04	<umop>	I have some kind of issue, I think, with samba.  Sometimes I cant mount directorys and it give the directories "?---------  ? ?      ?          ?    ?' permission.  What can i do?
03:04	<jonah>	velko, ah we're in this time
03:05	<hansen>	redguy, aight
03:05	<askar>	compwiz18: do you find anything? Thanks for trying to help out!
03:05	<hansen>	thinking if there are any way to stop amarok from reading ID3 tags on import
03:05	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, it's called mstruetype
03:05	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, it's in the repos
03:05	<compwiz18>	askar: try running sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
03:05	<delf0s>	mmkay
03:05	<delf0s>	thanks
03:05	<xukun_>	Huffalump, there is a lot of info in there how can I only grep the errors in that file?
03:05	<compwiz18>	askar" It should in theory set it up to what it was when you installed Ubuntu
03:05	<delf0s>	Horizons: what do you have your dpi set to?
03:06	<jrib>	stp2007: 7.04 is a lot more recent.  The only reason to use 6.06 is if you don't want to upgrade versions for a long time.  releases.ubuntu.com may have a more direct link to what you want
03:06	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, hmmm 90?
03:06	<askar>	compwiz18: what driver should I choose?
03:06	<jonah>	velko, ok when i click on users and groups i get "Failed to run users-admin  The underlying authorization mechanism (sudo) does not allow you to run this program"
03:06	<delf0s>	Is everything all big?
03:06	<Hor|zon>	no
03:06	<Tex_Arcana>	I did sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg it didn't work for my problem thouugh
03:06	<compwiz18>	askar: do you see something like intel or i810 or something?
03:06	<askar>	compwiz18: yep
03:07	<ytsestef>	blur doesn't work properly in aiglx while in xgl it works without a hitch. any ideas?
03:07	<Hor|zon>	depends on your monitor size
03:07	<velko>	jonah, you are logged now in ubuntu as billy, yes?
03:07	<delf0s>	I'm running a lappy
03:07	<jonah>	velko, yes
03:07	<stp2007>	jrib, I'm just trying to find a 32bit distribution and the 7.04 version 'Standard personal computer (x86 architecture, PentiumTM, CeleronTM, AthlonTM, SempronTM)' seems to be a 64 bit distribution and the other three download options available at ubuntu.com don't seem appropriate either. Any suggestions on where to find a 32 bit distribution?
03:07	<velko>	jonah, what says "id" executed in terminal ?
03:07	<stp2007>	jrib, Ill look at releases.ubuntu.com
03:07	<ctothej>	anyone know how to change the size of text in the gaim chat window?
03:07	<Huffalump>	xukun_ grep 'Error' /var/log/Xorg.0.log
03:07	<compwiz18>	askar: I would suggest you use i810 I think
03:07	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, my laptop has 96
03:08	<askar>	compwiz18: xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration

03:08	<askar>	:S
03:08	<compwiz18>	askar: yeah
03:08	<jonah>	velko, it says uid=1000(billy) gid=1000 groups=1000
03:08	<askar>	compwiz18: is that good?
03:08	<compwiz18>	askar: just backing up the borked file in case you need it again :D
03:08	<Stormx2>	Joy. Apt is broken.
03:08	<velko>	jonah, this is good. can you execute "sudo ls" in terminal?
03:08	<Palantor>	is there a bittorant feed for 7.04 yet? Can't find it on the download page
03:08	<askar>	compwiz18: ok Ill try to restart X now or reboot?
03:08	<delf0s>	damn... its to big
03:08	<compwiz18>	askar: restart X?  if that doesn't work, reboot
03:08	<compwiz18>	askar: tell me if it works
03:09	<umop>	I have some kind of issue, I think, with samba.  Sometimes I cant mount directorys and it give the directories "?---------  ? ?      ?          ?    ?' permission.  What can i do?
03:09	<askar>	compwiz18: ok brb!
03:09	<jonah>	velko, yeah did that but it didnt do anything, is that right?
03:09	<samtb>	hi there
03:09	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, change the dpi like I said, all my fonts are set to size 9
03:09	<samtb>	is it normal to have to put manual entries in /etc/modules or modprobe.d to get isa pnp sound card working
03:09	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, then just play with the dpi
03:09	<petriborg>	hello all - "bug-buddy" is causing my gnome-panel to hang and thus relaunching bug-buddy can someone help me break this loop?
03:10	<sickofwireles1>	hi - how do I switch between languages in SCIM?
03:10	<Stormx2>	Please can someone help? I really dont know what to do here.... dia-gnome won't "set up" and I can't seem to remove it.
03:10	<velko>	you are supposed to see the same as issuing just "ls". the output should not differ. for a better test you may try "sudo apitude"
03:10	<jonah>	velko, aptitude?
03:10	<Hor|zon>	delf0s, be careful though some fonts look bad at certain size setting at look great in other...fint the most smooth looking font size and then play with dpi
03:10	<velko>	jonah, no aptitude is no better. it may be executed by normal user too
03:10	<delf0s>	damnit.. cant find the mstruetype package
03:10	<jonah>	velko, sudo aptitude  just gives me a prompt
03:10	<Hor|zon>	and look great in others*
03:11	<asif>	Hi all
03:11	<nbjayme>	hello people. i was trying out a game called glest on ubuntu dapper.  it needs opengl 1.3, (i've googled on how to upgrade and having a hard time) can anyone show me how or where to get package file? thanks.
03:11	<Pelo>	petriborg,  you can disable bug-buddy in menu >	system >	admin >	services
03:11	<Stormx2>	Please?
03:11	<stp2007>	jrib, thx for the help. i know what is going on now. I tried to download it last night from the links above but it was very slow so bailed in lue of trying a torrent downoad. The torrent (when I examine it now) is the 64 bit version. My bad and time for a coffe.
03:11	<Stormx2>	>_<
03:11	<omaaaar>	using Feisty, wanna install a driver, but it is for 2.6.17, is it going to work?
03:11	<velko>	jonah, aptitude is bad example. it can be executed by ordinary user too. wait a sec please
03:11	<askar>	compwiz18: still doesnt work :(
03:11	<petriborg>	pelo - i can't use the menu because gnome-panel keeps crashing
03:11	<petriborg>	soon as it launchs it dies
03:11	<jonah>	velko, everything is just giving another prompt but not doing anything....
03:11	<Huffalump>	Stormx2, just ask your question and wait a few minutes.  No one likes the begging and emoticons ;)
03:11	<ctothej>	omaaaar: youll probably have to compile it for the new kernel
03:11	<asif>	I have a problem with the 3D effects in FF, There is a small line left on the screen when the menu appears, is there any fix for this?
03:12	<Pelo>	petriborg,  Ic, hold on I think I have a solution
03:12	<jonah>	velko, if i run aptitude without sudo it works, with sudo i just get a prompt again
03:12	<Pelo>	well part of one
03:12	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, alt+f1 will get you the menu if you'd like to know
03:12	<Daboone72>	Does anyone know if ubuntu-server can setup with RAID1 with LVM or not? I mean i would hope so
03:12	<Stormx2>	Huffalump: That is what I did... twice.
03:12	<velko>	jonah, try "sudo lsmod" this will list the modules loaded by the kernel. and can't be issued by normal user
03:12	<compwiz18>	askar: you rebooted too?
03:12	<Huffalump>	Stormx2, sometimes when there is no answer, it is because no one knows your solution and they don't waste time saying so.
03:12	<Stormx2>	Huffalump: So I figure.
03:12	<petriborg>	hor|zon - that doesn't seem to work maybe it doesn't because gnome-panel is dead?

03:13	<Huffalump>	Stormx2, just hang in there a bit and try again in 5 or 10 minutes.
03:13	<compwiz18>	askar: can you post your new xorg.conf file at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16808/
03:13	<velko>	jonah, very strange indeed
03:13	<omaaaar>	ctothej: that's what i do everytime, i wanna give the driver for some friends because the installation process isn't easy
03:13	<jonah>	velko, looks like my system is seriously busted up
03:13	<Kamaria>	Well, I've gone through hell and high water to get Windows XP to install on my machine ever since the first incident with Linux, and it stil lwon't work

03:13	<jonah>	velko, thanks i appreciate your help
03:13	<Stormx2>	Huffalump: i might as well go ask in #debian or something. No one seems to know now...
03:13	<Kamaria>	No matter what I do it just freezes on Setup is loading files...
03:13	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, you could always find the bug-buddy executable and rename it...although that doesn't fix the problem...just hides it
03:13	<velko>	jonah, np
03:13	<ctothej>	omaaaar: they have feisty and you have edgy?
03:14	<Huffalump>	Stormx2, that or try ubuntuforums.org

03:14	<ctothej>	omaaaar: which driver?
03:14	<petriborg>	hor|zon well it might get me out of the loop of gnome-panel crashing and bug-buddy launching and the gnome-panel auto-relaunching and crashing
03:14	<eternalswd>	anyone able to get the program tilda to work in feisty?  I keep getting either a "gtk_main_quit: assertion `main_loops != NULL' failed" if running with tilda -C or "gtk_window_resize: assertion `height >	0' failed" if run with just tilda
03:15	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, try sudo gnome-search-tool in the terminal and set / as the search path and search for it
03:15	<linoleum>	erUSUL: tkx ;)
03:15	<omaaaar>	for an adsl usb modem
03:15	<erUSUL>	linoleum: no problem :)

03:15	<velko>	jonah, what gives "cat /etc/aliases" ?
03:15	<omaaaar>	ctothej: for an adsl usb modem
03:15	<ctothej>	omaaaar: oh.. hmm. maybe as if someone else has it?
03:15	<ctothej>	ask*
03:15	<asif>	I have a problem with the 3D effects in FF, There is a small line left on the screen when the menu appears, is there any fix for this?
03:15	<Hor|zon>	lol

03:16	<petriborg>	OK all - new problem, gnome-panel is apparently crashing and then auto-relaunching and crashing again
03:16	<velko>	jonah, and now you are logged as billy. change it via dsl

03:16	<RARCA>	greetings all
03:16	<hellmitre>	hello
03:16	<imon9>	NOw my question is..why is it that the frontend not working but the backed is? (i am using xubuntu 7.04 with xfce 4.4.1
03:17	<ctothej>	omaaaar: the driver for the new kernel. or someone else can compile it for you for the certain architecture.
03:17	<petriborg>	so apparently gnome-panel has gotten something stuck in its craw >.<
03:17	<jonah>	velko, i want billy to be new user cos giving computer someone else
03:17	<jean>	Merci j'y vais
03:17	<jonah>	velko, then wanna completely remove jonah user
03:17	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, try launching it from the terminal and see if you can get an error message?
03:17	<velko>	jonah, just boot in dsl and change jonah to billy
03:17	<jonah>	velko, so i should boot DSL again?
03:17	<Huffalump>	xukun_ sounds like it's having trouble with an on-board ATI card.  this isn't a laptop?  I may remember wrong, but I thought you had mentioned nvidia
03:17	<jonah>	velko, ok
03:17	<velko>	jonah, yes. this is the only way to get write access now
03:17	<Tex_Arcana>	okay sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg got me in but I had to choose nv now I got to figure out how to get the right driver. The resricted driver manager got me into this mess
03:18	<RARCA>	I blacklisted ipv6 and still my firefox does not connect to the web.  Any more suggestions?
03:18	<omaaaar>	ctothej: can I suggest that this package to be included with
03:18	<petriborg>	Gtk-ERROR **: file gtkrecentmanager.c: line 2248 (get_uri_shortname_for_display): assertion failed: (name != NULL)
03:18	<petriborg>	aborting...
03:18	<omaaaar>	ctothej: ... to the next releases of ubuntu
03:18	<sinisterguy>	hey, i was wondering what the name of the app is that everyone keeps talking about that requires beryl/compiz/a compositer to work
03:18	<imon9>	hello everyone...i need some help on a funny issue: i upgraded to fiesty from edgy and scanning won't work anymore. Xsane is able to detect my scanner correctly but it wont move when i click preview/scan.. i uninstalled xsane and install sane & sane-utils then tried using the "scanimage commnad" and the scanner works... NOw my question is..why is it that the frontend not working but the backed is? (i am using xubuntu 7.04 with xfce 4.4.1
03:18	<ctothej>	omaaaar: yeah, its worth a shot.
03:18	<xukun_>	Huffalump, no is it not a laptop, I dont have onboard video card. its nvidia 5200 video card
03:18	<grirgz>	bye
03:19	<omaaaar>	ctothej: where?
03:19	<riccardo>	hello... i can't install feisty due to a bug in the installer: when i have to partition my disk, it doesn't recognize my existing partitions so i'd have to wipe out all my data to install ubuntu... edgy cd could see them... feisty doesn't :-(
03:19	<petriborg>	hor|zon did you see the error message?
03:19	<Stormx2>	Hey folks. I posted a full explaination of my apt woes. If anyone could help out I'd really appreciate it! Basically the install process seg faulted and now I can do nothing! My forum thread is here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2499455

03:19	<Pelo>	imon9,  serch around for a more recent version of the front end or  remove the frontend hidden folder from your /home folder and try again
03:19	<riccardo>	does anybody have the same problem?
03:19	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, did you upgrade or something?
03:19	<askar>	compwiz18: its installed..but a package named xserver-xorg-video-intel is not.. should I install it?

03:20	<xourge>	when i try to install ubuntu 7.04 it freezes on network-manager
03:20	<compwiz18>	askar: sure

03:20	<imon9>	funny thig is..all frot-end is ot working
03:20	<petriborg>	in fact i had just downloaded the ISO to upgrade and was going to burn the CD to try it out before i upgrade
03:20	<jonah>	velko, just booting up DSL, so what will i need to do?
03:20	<omaaaar>	ctothej: ok
03:20	<Tex_Arcana>	I think next time I'll wait a month after the new upgrade comes out before I upgrade.
03:20	<imon9>	pelo: does this have to do with xfce that i ewly installed? or is it fiesty ad its ew kernel?

03:21	<Pelo>	Tex_Arcana,  a week should do
03:21	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, basically gtkrecentmanager is to do with the recent files and tracking launches and stuff, I think it replaced egg-recent
03:21	<petriborg>	hor|zon the problem started when i accidently did "extract here" on the ISO for 7.04 which i was going to burn
03:21	<velko>	jonah, open /etc/aliases and change the word "jonah" to "billy" (with the correct user names, ignoring my possible typos)
03:21	<Pelo>	imon9,  I have no idea,  I was just suggesting a basic fix
03:21	<Huffalump>	xukun_ Okay, I believe you.  No problem.  Can you tell me the output of this command?   lspci | grep VGA
03:21	<Hor|zon>	petriborg, wild stab but try deleting the .recent files in your home directory?
03:21	<imon9>	pelo: do u know what part of ubuntu architecture is responsible to connection btw fronted ad backed of a applicatio?

03:22	<babo>	hmm, so I was writing an email to a client and I wanted to turn off my touchpad tapping. Instead I managed to turn off my touchpad. Then I couldn't get focus on the screen, so I started pressing random buttons to get X focus to open a terminal. The random button pressing brought down my wireless connection. Needless to say, I lost the email I was writing ...
03:22	<babo>	:-(
03:22	<Kamaria>	Hey guys, anyone got any advice for me? I'm pretty much stuck in Linux forever unless I can get XP to install without hanging...
03:22	<Huffalump>	xukun_ From there, I may not solve your problem by Preferred Method A, but I think we can probably get Workaround B to run in the meantime.
03:22	<Kamaria>	Not that it's a totally BAD thing, but...
03:22	<petriborg>	NICE WORK hor|zon!
03:22	<_Neil>	Kamaria: what happens?

03:29	<ctothej>	st9: boot up in an edgy live cd and test it out. even boot up to a command prompt and test it out there. you have to narrow down if it is the new installation or not.
03:29	<LjL>	Huffalump: it was ok like that, but since there were two guys spamming, and i saw only Tahir_H mentioned, i wasn't sure what to do. Tahir_H, anyway, i concur with the "don't spam"

03:30	<elkbuntu>	Huffalump, although, if you do "!ops | person" it helps alot
03:30	<Huffalump>	ok, thanks, gnomefreak and LjL. I was concerned about the several spanish flooders who were obviously together creating mischief.
03:30	<Huffalump>	ok, elkbuntu
03:30	<ctothej>	st9: maybe a background process it running and taking up the cpu and causing intermittent typing, could be a bunch of things.
03:30	<omaaaar>	is this a bug or something? this isn't the first time I install linux, I'm sure I didn't ask the partition to create a new partition
03:30	<compwiz18>	Buggie: you can use nspluginwrapper (I think that is the name)
03:30	<Pao>	ciao
03:30	<compwiz18>	duelboot: use precut firmware :)
03:30	<Lorvija>	heyy.. on the commandline if i use top how can i view the tasks which cant fit to the window because there's so many..?
03:30	<LjL>	Huffalump: that happens even too often, and definitely deserves a call to ops, i just didn't see it right away
03:30	<compwiz18>	duelboot: i can give you a link if you like

03:31	<ctothej>	!ask | davidosa
03:31	<ubotu>	davidosa: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
03:31	<Buggie>	compwiz18: I noticed that on debian forums, does the same method apply to ubuntu or do I have to set it up differently?
03:31	<will>	wow

03:31	<flubber>	thanks
03:31	<davidosa>	i downloaded RealPlayer 10.5 bin file
03:31	<st9>	ctothej: it does seem like that. If I type random letters here, terminal or anwhere in Gnome, at  periodic interval certain letters are missed. cpu usage is very low.. I'll try killing processes and also boot edgy, thanks
03:32	<Hor|zon>	lol is audacity gtk2 yet?
03:32	<davidosa>	how do i install it?
03:32	<compwiz18>	Buggie: I'll give you the link to the method I use, it seems to work fairly weel
03:32	<LjL>	Huffalump: they were all from the same address anyway, so they're all banned now
03:32	<velko>	jonah, ok my last idea: in the files /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow the user "jonah" is still in the administrator group and not the user "billy". you have to ...sigh... boot in dsl again, and change every ocurrance of "jonah" with "billy" in these files
03:32	<telexicon>	oh see this is freenode
03:32	<vsss>	a noob question: There is any tool for config apache2 in graphical mode?. Maybe with webbrowser?

03:32	<davidosa>	anyone?
03:32	<neuratix>	davidosa: i think realplayer is in the repositories, you can install it trhough add and remove programs
03:32	<velko>	jonah, :-)
03:32	<davidosa>	oh, i'll check then
03:32	<Buggie>	thanks compwiz18! much appreciated!

03:33	<Bundaluk>	I used update manager to upgrade to Feisty but internet connection dropped half way through. Now Update Manager doesn't recognise that the Feisty update is available. So I can't resume and cant find any fix on the wiki. Any help?

03:33	<Buggie>	costi, have you tried vlc player? it has all codecs included
03:33	<Huffalump>	xukun_ Ah, I understand.  You've stumped me, then.  I'm afraid I don't know that.  Shall we move on with trying the workaround I mentioned?  You'll be back at the root prompt in a terminal and we'll edit a file.
03:33	<flubber>	in audacity says you need libmp3lame.so

03:34	<compwiz18>	duelboot: I have a 4318, works for me

03:34	<davidosa>	Only thing i could find is an app called "Helix", is it the same thing as RealPlayer?
03:35	<xukun_>	ok
03:35	<Hor|zon>	RealPlayer uses Helix doesn't it?
03:35	<xtknight>	helix is a codec or infrastructure , yeah
03:35	<Lorvija>	heyy.. on the commandline if i use top how can i view the tasks which cant fit to the window as there's so many..?
03:35	<Tom47>	davidosa you have to make that file you downloaded executable ... are there not instructions on te site??? i forget
03:35	<davidosa>	I think so..i've seen it described on their page
03:35	<flubber>	does anybody know where i can get the file libmp3lame?
03:35	<Huffalump>	xukun_ at the prompt, nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
03:35	<ceil420>	what's the opposite of "su"?
03:35	<compwiz18>	askar: reminds me of my graphics card...did you install anything with the restricted drivers manager, just the ATI drivers right?
03:36	<davidosa>	I followed the instructions..launched Terminal and so forth, no luck

03:36	<ceil420>	heh
03:36	<ceil420>	no way to just go back to normal user?
03:36	<Huffalump>	xukun_ There it will list all the items X is looking for, by hardware.   We'll want to find your video card (it has a 2 line config) which is nested just above your monitor config details.
03:36	<compwiz18>	ceil420: exit
03:36	<xtknight>	flubber, you might be looking for this
03:36	<velko>	jonah, the files you want to edit are (all in /etc): group, group-, gshadow, gshadow-, passwd, passwd-, shadow and shadow- (to be hones i don't know anything about the files with a dash at the end, but do edit them anyway)

03:37	<pjesi>	LjL: ok compiling
03:37	<davidosa>	Tom47..here is the link

03:38	<xtknight>	Bloe, it is in gnome-games to my knowledge?
03:38	<velko>	jonah, /etc is the central configuration directory in linux. i just did a search for my name in this directory and these are the files which are the best candidates for the job. i don't think anything outside of /etc is relevant. edit them and hold your breath :-)
03:38	<xtknight>	Bloe, if that's not the one youre looking for, can you link me to what you are compiling (tarball)?

03:39	<xtknight>	hacked_kernel, it should be able to scan.  try 'iwlist eth0 scan'

03:40	<velko>	jonah, you may search for all ocurrances of the string "jonah" in this directory with the command "rgrep jonah /mnt/hda1/etc"

03:41	<chrissi>	Bundaluk: same problem here
03:41	<Rprp`>	Hi, Are there any Broadcasters for Linux? Something like SAM BROADCASTER?
03:41	<jonah>	velko, gshadow just says billy:!::    is that right?
03:41	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, youd be better off being a lot more specific
03:41	<asif>	I have a problem with the 3D effects in FF, There is a small line left on the screen when the menu appears, is there any fix for this?
03:41	<Wesselaar>	does anyone knows why my soundcards have a different number at every boot? , my usb mic was hw2,0 , and now after a reboot it is hw0,0 , maybe at next boot it will be 1,0 :-) , im using dapper 6.06.1 , and i have a via8235 soundcard
03:41	<LjL>	pjesi: i'm still waiting for the compile (it's not *that* slow, but i made a mistake first time). however i'm afraid i've forgot about something i had messed with, earlier (i've been tweaking files like mad)
03:41	<chrissi>	I updated my edgy with usual updates (like it's recommend)
03:41	<Bundaluk>	chrissi: did you find a fix for it somewhere?
03:41	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, what troubles exactly are you having with your upgrade?
03:41	<unimatrix9>	Rprp : whats sam?
03:41	<compwiz18>	askar: HAL..?  What is it doing?
03:41	<hacked_kernel>	Are there free conexant drivers other than the free version of linuxant?
03:41	<xtknight>	Bloe, you'll have to highlight your messages with my name or i'll miss them easily
03:42	<chrissi>	no, there is only this thread in the forum for it: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=416558&highlight=upgrade+button
03:42	<Huffalump>	Bundaluk, not many people will get into the flame war on people who give up and surrender themselves to Vista slavery.  However, you may consider upgrading from a CD if you have download problems during an upgrade.
03:42	<xtknight>	Bloe, i got the link though, give me a moment
03:42	<Bundaluk>	xtknight: I used update manager to upgrade to feisty...
03:42	<velko>	jonah, this is what we want to accomplish. "billy" everywhere instead of "jonah"
03:42	<Bloe>	xtknight: Ok, I'm sorry.
03:42	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: don't expect people here to be familiar with windows apps. not everyone has used windows berfore using linux.
03:42	<Bundaluk>	Then half way through the process my internet connection dropped out...
03:42	<kisho1>	Hey thanks let me try though I tried earlier with xorg tweaking .. albeit all failure
03:42	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - did you plug it in different places or just reboot?
03:42	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: have you tried booting the older kernel from the grub menu yet?
03:43	<askar>	compwiz18: atheros hardware access layer
03:43	<Rprp`>	POVaddct: Hmm, oke... but is there any 'Linux Broadcaster'?
03:43	<Bundaluk>	And the manager reverted all of the feisty files back to edgy...
03:43	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg i just did a reboot

03:43	<ceil420>	how can i make that a good substitution? :x
03:43	<xtknight>	ceil420, are you using the right shell (bash vs sh)?
03:43	<chrissi>	Huffalump: Oh I don't have any connection-problems - the upgrade manager doesn't show any upgrade button (which was shown before I updated edgy with security fixes)
03:43	<unimatrix9>	Rprp , icecast?
=== yeti_ is now known as yetiman
03:43	<Bundaluk>	Now when I try to use Update Manager it doesn't give an option to upgrade to Feisty.
03:43	<ceil420>	i dno :o
03:43	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: i don't know what you mean by broadcaster? something like icecast maybe?
03:43	<unimatrix9>	Rprp : or maybe VLC

03:43	<petriborg>	Wesselaar, how odd, i have a USB headset and mine doesn't do that, any custom drivers or anything?
03:43	<xtknight>	aricz_, ubuntu has all ports open by default
03:43	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: did you see my post?
03:43	<b_e_n_z>	i tried getting netbeans 5.5 and in the middle of the apt-get, it says i have to download *.tgz from sun.com... what's going on?  i thought java se 6 + glassfish app server + netbeans should be available in the repository
03:44	<Huffalump>	Bundaluk, again, have you considered upgrading from CD?  Or what ctothej recommended?
03:44	<askar>	compwiz18: yes.. there was a command I could check that but dont remember?
03:44	<ceil420>	if it works, thanks (cos i'll be in a game); if not, i'll ask again but thanks for trying :p

03:45	<xtknight>	!pastebin | Bloe
03:45	<compwiz18>	duelboot: ok

03:45	<sarah>	 irc.gamesurge.net
03:45	<pspawn>	Huffalump: yes, i've chekced
03:46	<vox754>	aricz_, you usually open them in the router, not in the Operating system itself
03:46	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg , it has been 0,0 1,0 and 2,0 today here
03:46	<Huffalump>	xukun_ Were you able to verify that driver setting?  Or where are we now?
03:46	<browns>	how do i make microsoft XP my deafult boot?
03:46	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, sorry.  you'll have to highlight your messages with my name in front or i'll miss them easily
03:46	<vega__>	can i use ubuntu as nas server
03:46	<Huffalump>	browns, edit your grub menu list and put windows on top of the list
03:46	<pspawn>	Huffalump: There's a sound coming, but i sounds like static and nothing more.
03:46	<compwiz18>	askar: try opening a terminal and modprobe i810, then restart x
03:46	<aricz_>	vox754, strange, I had no problems with it in winxp
03:46	<Bundaluk>	ctclothej: How do I upgrade using the CD rather than doing a fresh install.. I dont want to need to back up all the data on my hard drive and then reinstall it.
03:46	<Wesselaar>	never had that with opensuse , but i dont like suse
03:46	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, what happened after your network dropped?
03:46	<compwiz18>	askar: use << sudo modprobe i810 >>
03:46	<unimatrix9>	vega : freenas is very easy to setup , google for it...
03:46	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, are you on edgy now?  feisty?  frankenstein?
03:46	<nraic>	xtknight, I installed cpuburn in from package manager, I cant find it in the application, who do I run the program?
03:46	<compwiz18>	askar: use sudo modprobe i810
03:46	<vega__>	thanks
03:46	<xukun_>	Huffalump, sorry I lost the connection so I missed everything you said before. yes I pasted the whole thing at: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16817/ please take a look
03:46	<mtron_x86>	anyone experienced with kaffeine here?
03:46	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: the upgrade cd should detect your installation and keep the data.
03:46	<xtknight>	nraic, type "dpkg -L cpuburn", that may give you a cule
03:47	<xtknight>	clue*
03:47	<petriborg>	Wesselaar do you have a custom .asoundrc file?
03:47	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: you shouldnt have to reformat at all
03:47	<askar>	compwiz18: ok ill try.. should I choose to use i180 in the xorg file again?
03:47	<compwiz18>	yeah
03:47	<compwiz18>	askar: yeah
03:47	<Bundaluk>	xtknight: when the line dropped out it very cleverly and automatically reverted all files back to edgy
03:47	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, ok what happens if you run update-manager again?
03:47	<nraic>	xtknight, yeh give me lots of dir, which one would be the binary i need to run?
03:47	<davidosa>	How do i install the RealPlayer .bin file
03:47	<browns>	Huffalump, whats the grub menu and how do i get into it?
03:48	<xtknight>	nraic, look for files that have no extension.  these are usually binaries
03:48	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, no i havent , would that solve the problem ?
03:48	<askar>	compwiz18: should I install xserver-xorg-video-i810 again too? :o
03:48	<compwiz18>	askar: yes
03:48	<Huffalump>	xukun_ I see it on line 86, where it says "nv" and that would have been my workaround.  So, I wont be able to help you further, unfortunately.  Sorry to disappoint.
03:48	<xtknight>	nraic, ok see where it says /usr/bin/*
03:48	<vox754>	!grub >	browns
03:48	<velko>	jonah, are you still fighting?
03:48	<ytsestef>	how do I change my monitors refresh rate from 60 Hz to 75? I edited my xorg.conf but still only 60Hz is available..
03:48	<Bundaluk>	xtknight: it doesn't give the "upgrade to feisty" button up the top. No matter how often I refresh.
03:49	<xtknight>	nraic, everything under /usr/bin/ is a binary.  it installed six programs.  it looks like each one is optimized for a specific architecture
03:49	<xukun_>	Huffalump, I understand thanks for trying anyways
03:49	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - i don't know for sure or anything, mine didn't work at all until i wrote a custom rc file, that might be a 6.10 issue though
03:49	<nraic>	xtknight, ok il try run one of them
03:49	<petriborg>	ytsestef - did you use a custom mode line to do it?
03:49	<Huffalump>	xukun_ one last thing, what happens if you run startx at this point?
03:49	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, interesting.  dont you have to throw parameters to update-manager, though  like -c or -d?
03:49	<duelboot>	compwiz18, no joy...I get the icon indicating connection, but no bars and my network is unreachable...any ideas?
03:50	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, the custom asoundrc links a programm to the correct hw number , but the hw number changes everytime here :-)
03:50	<duelboot>	compwiz18, no joy...I get the icon indicating connection, but no bars and my network is unreachable...any ideas?
03:50	<ytsestef>	petriborg: what do you mean? i edited the file in nano
03:50	<compwiz18>	duelboot: what program are you using the manage the connection?
03:50	<chrissi>	Bundaluk: did you try to update to feisty before?
03:50	<Woody_>	/server #undernet
03:50	<ytsestef>	petriborg: although i think you are not talking about this... hehe
03:50	<xukun_>	Huffalump, I try that
03:50	<browns>	vox754,	!grub >	browns huh, little more info?
03:50	<atomiku>	I'm currently using openbox, What panel should I use?
03:50	<Bundaluk>	xtknight I'll give ait a quick try
03:50	<Huffalump>	xukun_ What kind of ugliness?
03:51	<atomiku>	Tried xfce4-panel and gnome-panel, they both sorta suck
03:51	<jonah>	velko, yeah just booting up xubuntu again to try it - man this sucks, all i did was add another user in...
03:51	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, like "gksu update-manager -c -d"
03:51	<petriborg>	ytsestef - i did ModeLine    "1600x1200_59.92_rb" 130.25 1600 1648 1680 1760 1200 1203 12    07 1235 +hsync -vsync
03:51	<duelboot>	the default...and I've tried the command line as well
03:51	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: no -d
03:51	<chrissi>	I only installed security fixes to edgy and NO update option
03:51	<xtknight>	gnomefreak, no?  i've seen it before
03:51	<vox754>	!grub | browns you probably missed it
03:51	<ubotu>	browns you probably missed it: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
03:51	<Huffalump>	browns, sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
03:51	<xtknight>	gnomefreak, ah it's for devel releases
03:51	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: -d == development release
03:51	<odium>	I want to tackle my sound trouble today, where should I begin? I have a ensonic audio pci sound card?!
03:51	<velko>	jonah, yeah in ubuntu only the first user you create have the admin privileges ;-)
03:51	<petriborg>	ytsestef - that changed mine from like 76 to 74.99 or something
03:51	<Huffalump>	browns, use cut/paste to move windows to the top of the list
03:51	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, just "gksu update-manager -c" actually but -d wouldnt have done anything
03:52	<kel>	Hi.
03:52	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - its really odd i'm not sure what to do sorry :(
03:52	<xtknight>	do they have any repositories setup for gutsy yet?
03:52	<ytsestef>	petriborg: i don't how to use ModeLine parameters. i edited the  monitor properties instead
03:52	<pjesi>	LjL: I perhaps should have mentioned that I use Kubuntu
03:52	<xtknight>	or any "infrastructure" if you will
03:52	<Bundaluk>	chrissi I've successfully updated on my desktop... Internet connection kept it together long enough :) Just Laptop with the problem!
03:52	<xukun_>	Huffalump, but i have to kill it first because X is already running but with that green/yellow screen
03:52	<Buggie>	yay, flash player is working, thanks compwiz18!
03:52	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: toolchain might be ill be checking later
03:52	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, no problem , tnx for reacting anyway
03:52	<Zeka-Rodzer>	hi 2 all
03:52	<xtknight>	gnomefreak, ah what is toolchain?
03:52	<odium>	What steps should I take to trouble shoot my audio troubles?!
03:52	<Huffalump>	xukun_ but its not running under root is it?
03:52	<Bundaluk>	xtknight: I'll try it out in a minute and let you know how I go..
03:52	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, okay
03:52	<duelboot>	compwiz18, the default network manager
03:52	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - i assume you checked google
03:53	<ytsestef>	petriborg: can you give me a link or sth on how to use ModeLine?
03:53	<odium>	I'm using an old compy with a Audio PCI card from Ensonic.
03:53	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: gcc and freinds
03:53	<duelboot>	compwiz18, but the problem appears to be with my card...
03:53	<chrissi>	Bundaluk: That's interesting. Same problem here, but I didn't even tried to update to feisty
03:53	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: the base so you can build packages
03:53	<compwiz18>	duelboot: good luck with it, it doesn't like bcm43xx all the time
03:53	<compwiz18>	duelboot: what does iwlist scan give you?
03:53	<xukun_>	Huffalump, no it just started with the live cd
03:53	<duelboot>	compwiz18, the list of WAPs
03:53	<LjL>	pjesi: i use kubuntu too... it's frustrating, i had got it to a point where it didn't give the python errors anymore - just complained that Python.h was missing in a c++ file, solved by exporting an appropriate INCLUDE variable... - but then it complained that "swig" should have been used in "classic" mode. in order to do that, i had to remake the whole thing, and i deleted the directory
03:53	<Bloe>	xtknight: I saw one error of the XML Parser:http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16818/
03:53	<petriborg>	ytsestef - i used a webpage i found to generate the number
03:53	<xukun_>	Huffalump, and from there I when to console
03:53	<odium>	someone give me a nudge in the right direction, please.
03:53	<LjL>	pjesi: now i don't remember how the heck i get past those python errors, and my shell history doesn't help at all
03:54	<compwiz18>	duelboot: are you trying to connect to an encrypted or not encrypted network?
03:54	<ytsestef>	petriborg, oh, i see.. thanks!
03:54	<pspawn>	anyone else had mic problems with feisty?
03:54	<duelboot>	compwiz18, I can scan and "connect" but get no signal after...it's unencrypted
03:54	<odium>	Audio PCI from ensonic, I've tried numerously with no avail.
03:54	<Huffalump>	xukun_ from the frozen X, try CTRL+ALT+Backspace
03:54	<chrissi>	xtknight: c-Option helped
03:54	<Tom47>	davidosa what happens when you enter each of those instructions?
03:54	<compwiz18>	do you know how to use iwconfig, ifconfig, route, dhclient, etc?
=== felixhummel__ is now known as felixhummel
03:54	<pjesi>	LjL: but you got past them without actually modifying any code right?
03:55	<compwiz18>	duelboot: do you know how to use iwconfig, ifconfig, route, dhclient, etc?
03:55	<LjL>	pjesi: err, no, not exactly
03:55	<pfk>	anyone having trouble with KVM?  I get a core dump when the vm starts.  It looks like it is related to real mode support of the intel VT extensions.
03:55	<xukun_>	Huffalump, did that but it comes back the same problem
03:55	<duelboot>	compwiz18, or anyone...what chipset should I get in my wireless card (yes, I know I will have to buy another)...yes I've tried all of that compwiz18
03:55	<petriborg>	ytsestef - http://www.sh.nu/nvidia/gtf.php
03:55	<petriborg>	ytsestef - i'm not sure if that is the right one but it looked sort of like that
03:55	<davidosa>	When i do, Terminal says no such directory exists
03:56	<askar>	compwiz18: nope :(
03:56	<Rprp`>	POVaddct: Yea, Something like ICecast, I did install shoutcast, But i want to manage the songs etc,..
03:56	<Huffalump>	xukun_ that should kill X and dump you to a prompt
03:56	<duelboot>	compwiz18, sad part is it worked immediately with my Vaio...it's the gateway giving me problems
03:56	<petriborg>	ytsestef - googling for x11 modeline generator will probably find what you want
03:56	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: sorry, i dont use such tools
03:56	<ytsestef>	petriborg: thanks, i googled modeline and i found another
03:56	<compwiz18>	askar: ok...yeah, my friend has a Vaio, it works beautifully for him

03:56	<petriborg>	ytsestef - cool :-)
03:56	<xukun_>	Huffalump, no it does not, I just restarts it
03:56	<xtknight>	chrissi, ?
03:56	<ytsestef>	petriborg: if it doesn't work, i will use the one u gave me
03:56	<ytsestef>	petriborg: thanks a lot
03:56	<pjesi>	ok
03:57	<fuzzy_logic>	hello people
03:57	<Huffalump>	xukun_ ok, then CTRL+ALT+F1   and at the prompt type: killall gdm
03:57	<brent>	hi, does anyone know why GTK+ has the 'plus' on the end?  Is there some historical difference between GTK and GTK+?
03:57	<askar>	compwiz18: ok :( I dont know what I have done
03:57	<spikeb>	i would love to know that.
03:57	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: my only mp3 usage is running xmms, a player with a interface that reportedly looks like winamp
03:57	<chrissi>	xtknight: gksu "update-manager -c" works - the option appeared again
03:57	<xtknight>	Bloe, ah ok you need a package hold on
03:57	<Rprp`>	POVaddct: Hmm, oke :<
03:57	<xtknight>	chrissi, ah was i helping you? different nickname?
03:57	<compwiz18>	askar: I have to go, sorry.  but good luck with it :) if it makes you feel any better, my card is dead too.  restricted-manager denies the existance of my ATI card and I've spend quite a while playing with it...
03:57	<Bloe>	xtknight: Ok, thanks. :)
03:57	<spikeb>	brent: that's a good question
03:57	<duelboot>	compwiz18, thanks for trying...now I get [ 2749.882658]  bcm43xx: FATAL ERROR: BCM43xx_IRQ_XMIT_ERROR
03:57	<brent>	i thought so :)
03:57	<Buggie>	right, thanks for the help, bye!
03:57	<fuzzy_logic>	i once tried to install the kernel that uses dual core.. and since then i have Ubuntu, memtest86+ in my boot list.. do i need this and what is it?
03:57	<askar>	compwiz18: ok thanks for trying
03:58	<chrissi>	xtknight: no my problem is very similiar to Bundaluk's
03:58	<velko>	brent, it does have the plus at the end. this is the official name
03:58	<compwiz18>	askar: good luck, sorry we couldn't fix it
03:58	<duelboot>	compwiz18, maybe I need to change the interrupt?
03:58	<xtknight>	chrissi, oh i see.  yeah that is by design.  it wont show unless you do -c
03:58	<brent>	velko, yeah I know that, but why is it there?
03:58	<CarlFK>	i have 2 nic's - how do I define which gets assigned eth0?
03:58	<linoleum>	hello , I have a question about the behaviour of synaptic and the add/remove . For exemple, if I search for "epiphany" and add/remove, it will show me only the browser... but If I do the same search in synaptic, it will show me the browser AND the epiphany-extentions ... same for nvidia : add/remove show me only nvidia-glx and nvidia-legacy, but synaptic shows me also nvidia-glx-new ... but I have choosen to show "all available applica
03:58	<linoleum>	tion" in add/remove ... can someone explain to me why I can't see everything and add/remove ?
03:58	<jman_>	I got samba working as a PDC!! :-D
03:58	<xtknight>	chrissi, im not sure how you guys got it originally, you must have used -c?
03:58	<jman_>	No more Windoze Server 2000
03:58	<compwiz18>	duelboot: go ahead (/me has no idea what an interrupt is :P)
03:58	<aeonix>	does ant one have7.04 yet and can thay tell me how it is?
03:58	<hordur>	hi all
03:58	<spikeb>	hmm
03:59	<spikeb>	brent: well i checked wikipedia and they say it's always been called gtk+
03:59	<Huffalump>	xtknight or do you mean -d?  That's what started my trouble.
03:59	<CarlFK>	aeonix: it rocks.
03:59	<brent>	i guess i'll go ask #linux and see if anyone knows there
03:59	<xtknight>	Bloe, libxml-parser-perl - Perl module for parsing XML files
03:59	<chrissi>	xtknight: No the option was there until I installed edgy security fixes (like it's recommend before upgrading)
03:59	<hordur>	i upgraded to v6.10 and lost my internet connection (dhcp ethernet), can anyone plz help?
03:59	<xtknight>	Huffalump, -d is to upgrade to a development release.  i wouldnt use it
03:59	<duelboot>	Can anyone tell me a wireless card or chipset I should use for success?
03:59	<Bloe>	xtknight: Thank you very much. :)
03:59	<brent>	spikeb, yeah i checked wikipedia too, nothing there
03:59	<lillrazor>	anyone who knows how to start the computer without xserver? just get the terminal at startup?
03:59	<Huffalump>	xtknight, I won't ever again... I can tell ya that!
03:59	<spikeb>	duelboot: ralink
03:59	<vox754>	duelboot, actually broadcom seems well supported...but maybe an intel ipw http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=361041 or ralink
03:59	<fuzzy_logic>	aeonix: i recommend you not to upgrade just yet.. i still have probs with upgrading.. it has nice features but not everything works well.. i think it needs some time so that people can write howto's etc. for it..
03:59	<benpicco>	i think it\'s quiet a stupid question, but: how do I start a dial up connection with my 56k Modem? (serial, it is dedected and configured, i just can\'t find something like a \'connect\' button)
03:59	<Flannel>	linoleum: add/remove has a simplified subset of packages in the repositories, and they all have more user-friendly names ("Web browser" or whatever instead of the actual name)
04:00	<duelboot>	spikeb vox754 thanks
04:00	<xtknight>	all, wont the upgrade notice only appear if you initiate update-manager with -c from the command line??
04:00	<aeonix>	<CarlFK>	what makes it difrent that 6.06 and 6.10?
04:00	<CarlFK>	duelboot: pci, pccard or minipci ?
04:00	<CarlFK>	aeonix: better wifi support
04:00	<epod>	xtknight, update-manager -c -d
04:00	<Flannel>	xtknight: no.  -c is only required when upgrading from an LTS to a non
04:00	<aricz_>	Uhm, does Ubuntu run somekind of firewall without me knowing? :)
04:00	<duelboot>	CarlFK, pcmcia
04:00	<linoleum>	Flannel: is it possible to change the behaviour of add/remove, so it can shows me as many package as synaptic?
04:00	<Flannel>	!firewall | aricz_
04:00	<xukun_>	Huffalump, no no luck it comes back with the same problem
04:00	<ubotu>	aricz_: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
04:00	<chrissi>	xtknight: Now the problem appeared again... I closed update-manger, started it again (with c-Switch) and no update-button
04:00	<czedlitz>	i have a folder on a HD in my user and group, but i need to change the group to users so that some of the other users on my system can access that folder, what is the command line i need to change that folders group to users but to keep me as owner of the files?
04:00	<xtknight>	Flannel, ah?  the dist-upgrade appears in a normal periodic update-manager for edgy->Feisty?
04:00	<aricz_>	Flannel : thanks
04:00	<fiery_cleric>	benpicco: not in system->admin->networking?
04:01	<raw>	% dpkg
04:01	<raw>	sudo: dpgk: command not found
04:01	<Flannel>	linoleum: don't believe so.  Why?  You should be using synaptic if you want the full list
04:01	<Huffalump>	xukun_ so you killed the gdm, right?  and then what?  startx?  before you did the startx again, I wanted to verify the config for that particular user
04:01	<xtknight>	raw: dpkg
04:01	<raw>	someone typoed there
04:01	<aeonix>	fuzzy_logic ok thanks then i will prolly wait a few months
04:01	<Huffalump>	xukun_ unless you're telling me that everything is running as root, which then I could understand... but not how you got there ;)
04:01	<xtknight>	chrissi, weird.  did you close it before pressing update the first time?
04:01	<raw>	xtknight: no
04:01	<hordur>	i upgraded from 6.06 with working internet connection to v 6.10 and my network refuses to work. ive checked all the settings that i can find, and for some reason it seems to default to IPV6 network. can anyone help a linux noob?
04:01	<laklak>	#ubuntu-forum
04:01	<CarlFK>	duelboot: "chipsets from Atheros"  http://madwifi.org/
04:01	<fuzzy_logic>	aeonix: np :)
04:01	<linoleum>	Flannel: because I find add/remove much more intuitive and fast to use. It is much more in the spirit of the HIG of gnome
04:01	<xtknight>	raw, no?
04:01	<Flannel>	xtknight: yeah.  The flag is only required because it'd be real annoying for 6.06 people to keep seeing edgy upgrade notices for two years
04:01	<raw>	xtknight: if I type 'dpkg' the output is 'dpgk: command not found'
04:02	<synthesetic>	Hello
04:02	<xtknight>	raw you're typing it wrong
04:02	<duelboot>	CarlFK, am looking now...thanks
04:02	<raw>	xtknight: no, dpkg is not wrong
04:02	<xtknight>	raw, but dpgk is
04:02	<xtknight>	raw, look at the error
04:02	<duelboot>	CarlFK, presume it works natively (without ndiswrapper)?

04:02	<raw>	xtknight: yeah, but I'm not typing dpkg

04:03	<xukun_>	Huffalump, thanks a lot for everything
04:03	<xtknight>	raw, type dpkg man... d p k g ;)
04:03	<delire>	raw: 'whereis dpkg'
04:03	<chrissi>	xtknight: do you mean upgrade? I only installed security fixes for edgy (the upgrade-button was visible then) rebooted, started update-manager again and there was no Upgrade button anymore... I NEVER tried to upgrade to feisty
04:03	<fiery_cleric>	anyone use a toshiba tecra 9100 or close to it?
04:03	<jonah>	velko, same error message
04:03	<TheSilentW>	what is the path to grub config??

04:03	<fuzzy_logic>	aeonix: well.. i have problems getting it to work myself.. i didn't spend much time figuring that out cause i don't use them a lot.. but i still haven't got it to work..
04:03	<xtknight>	raw, there is no command similar to dpkg.  if he said dkpg he meant dpkg, rest assured
04:03	<askar>	Can someone here help me get working direct rendering?

04:03	<TheSilentW>	idefixx, thx
04:03	<Huffalump>	xukun_ ok, killall gdm as the user, then check the xorg.conf to make sure it is nv (not nvidia or vesa!) or modify it as necessary.  then startx and all should be well.  nv is the most basic and stable for your card.
04:03	<delire>	synthesetic: are you on Feisty? if so see system->administration->restricted driver manager
04:03	<synthesetic>	No Delire, Edgy
04:03	<epod>	askar, what is the problem? it ought to just work

04:04	<synthesetic>	I get
04:04	<fuzzy_logic>	i once tried to install the kernel that uses dual core.. and since then i have Ubuntu, memtest86+ in my boot list.. do i need this and what is it?

04:04	<askar>	epod: yeah I know.. It did.. but one day I clicked ATI thing in restricted manager..I couldnt get into X after that so I restored an old xorg.conf backup.. and now no direct rendering
04:04	<mtron_x86>	fuzzy: a small app to test your RAM
04:04	<epod>	fuzzy_logic, uhh... memtest... tests memory.
04:05	<delire>	synthesetic: you are using synaptic or apt elsewhere. that's why you get that error
04:05	<CarlFK>	duelboot: no clue.  whatever is cheapest?
04:05	<fuzzy_logic>	epod: ok tnx
04:05	<Stormx2>	Hey folks. I posted a full explaination of my apt woes. If anyone could help out I'd really appreciate it! Basically the install process seg faulted and now I can do nothing! My forum thread is here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2499455
04:05	<laktek>	is it alright if i run programs while it upgrades to Fetisy
04:05	<delire>	synthesetic: ps ax | grep apt'
04:05	<epod>	askar, check which driver you're using in your xorg.conf, is it i810 ?
04:05	<duelboot>	CarlFK, okay thanks
04:05	<synthesetic>	Ah crap OK :P
04:05	<benpicco>	fiery_cleric: Well, but there I just can configure it, can\'t I?
04:05	<delire>	synthesetic: ;)
04:05	<velko>	jonah, last thing i can suggest is: reset the root password, log in as root and set new passoword. after that billy will be able to use "su" but not "sudo" for administrative tasks
04:05	<chrissi>	will try if a reboot changes something
04:05	<synthesetic>	lol

04:05	<synthesetic>	Its working now :P
04:06	<synthesetic>	I'm pretty much a linux newb
04:06	<delire>	synthesetic: apt needs to lock the process so the package information can be sequentially and correctly recorded. two apt-get install's at the same would lead to disaster.
04:06	<mtron_x86>	fuzzy: you can delete it from menu.lst if you don't use it
04:06	<delire>	synthesetic: we all were once!
04:06	<jonah>	velko, maybe i should just reinstall fresh xubuntu for him, i don't want anything wrong in background that shouldnt be sort of thing. thanks man

04:06	<epod>	Huffalump, what the heck?] 
04:06	<vox754>	aricz_, I tell you, it is the router. I had a similar situation. In Windows it worked okay so I didn't do anything special, then it became slow, I opened the ports and everything went smooth.Don't worry about it.
04:06	<Huffalump>	haha
04:06	<Huffalump>	sorry epod

04:07	<oldude67>	feisty

04:07	<SnakePlisken>	dont think so....upgrading is for the birds
04:08	<JC_Denton_>	is there a mplayer plugin for opera?
04:08	<synthesetic>	Really Delire?
04:08	<xtknight>	oldude67, for JAVA JRE 1.5, "sudo apt-get install sun-java5-plugiin"
04:08	<synthesetic>	I didn't upgrade yet because I was afraid of the ATI support not working
04:08	<Huffalump>	All, I need a big, hairy axe-swinging Ubuntu guru to succeed where others have failed before in solving an API mismatch in X.
04:08	<xtknight>	oldude67, plugin*  although 1.6 is recommended, so java6 for that
04:08	<synthesetic>	But, I'll be back.. time to reboot to complete these configs.

04:08	<delire>	synthesetic: yes, there is a noticeable speedup that's for sure. also driver installation for troublesome cards is better as is wifi support in general.
04:09	<fiery_cleric>	velko: probably coz it is superset of the functions needed for gimp
04:09	<LjL>	pjesi: sorry but i really am giving up
04:09	<JC_Denton_>	is there a mplayer plugin for opera?
04:09	<xtknight>	pjesi, LjL what's the problem?

04:09	<brent>	velko, ok :)
04:09	<xtknight>	oh py stuff :\
04:10	<delire>	jisatsu: what card is it? perhaps network-manager is getting in the way.

04:10	<epod>	askar, try adding Load    "i2c" to your Modules section
04:10	<Hidan>	... ... this sucks. somehow, clicking on "Applications" from the Taskbar can't bring up the "Applications menu" .
04:10	<LjL>	xtknight: he's on edgy, i'm on feisty, we get slightly different errors, but anyway i suspect it has to do with that program really warning python 2.3 rather than 2.4 (edgy) or 2.5 (feisty). at any rate, it won't compile
04:11	<jisatsu>	delire: realtek chipset, yeah
04:11	<gecko>	hey where can i get some help installing a dock in XGL on 7.04?
04:11	<delire>	jisatsu: right, this is a known problem..
04:11	<xtknight>	LjL, ah right from the start it's kinda intimidating..no configure in the root dir
04:11	<askar>	epod:  hrm ok.. ill try
04:11	<delire>	Horscht: unless they're using Feisty of course..

04:11	<laktek>	how to cancel a upgrade ?
04:11	<sixth>	unimatrix9: no
04:11	<epod>	askar, also, are you getting an out of video memory error?
04:11	<sixth>	magnetron: yes i did
04:11	<Horscht>	delire: sorry?
04:11	<delire>	jisatsu: try this: sudo apt-get remove network-manager --purge
04:11	<LjL>	xtknight: yeah, quite intimidating, try make though, it'll complain about swig, if you install swig, it'll compile quite a few things, and then give python errors
04:11	<sixth>	i own an ATI radeon card
04:11	<BeBraw>	sixth: it does not work with ati
04:12	<spikeb>	sixth: im sorry
04:12	<jisatsu>	delire: ok, one sec
04:12	<delire>	jisatsu: then just use the normal Gnome network-admin tool.
04:12	<xtknight>	LjL, do you know the homepage of that package?
04:12	<xtknight>	the .tar.*
04:12	<sixth>	BeBraw: what does then?
04:12	<JC_Denton_>	hello all, is there a mplayer plugin for opera?

04:12	<delire>	Horscht: reccommending people on Feisty to use the binary driver howto is not necessary if they can just system->administration->restricted driver manager
04:12	<kbrooks>	brent, what?
04:13	<epod>	askar, k.
04:13	<tarelerulz>	I think I have read of an plugin for mplayer for Opera
04:13	<Horscht>	delire, i wanted info on the drivers :D

04:13	<delire>	Horscht: ahah ;)
04:13	<BeBraw>	sixth: there are open source drivers that work with certain ati cards well (google for ati and aiglx)
04:13	<pjesi>	LjL: you have done more than enough! many thanks
04:13	<epod>	askar, try restarting X, then run glxinfo | grep rendering when it's back up and let me know what it says

04:14	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb, all i get is a great grey square
04:14	<sixth>	BeBraw: so you're pretty much saying my gfxcard driver isnt installed? by "restricted drivers manager" it says it is installed

04:17	<askar>	epod: direct rendering: No
04:17	<askar>	:(
04:17	<magnetron>	sixth: you have the driver, but with ATI that is not enough. see link
04:17	<delire>	Horscht: it was my mistake (damn tab completion) ;)
04:17	<mrcreativity>	anyone? its intel hda
04:17	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb, no.. apt commands?
04:17	<tarelerulz>	other wise it was at something 800X600 which is lame
04:17	<HYPOCRISY>	Hello
04:17	<epod>	askar, odd.  Your conf looks fine. Hm.
04:17	<elsni>	tarelerulz: sorry my english is not the best, I dont't understand what you mean.
04:17	<delire>	mrcreativity: can you 'lsmod | snd-hda-intel'
04:17	<spikeb>	JC_Denton_: totem-mozilla is the totem plugin
04:17	<askar>	epod: hrm ok.. :(
04:17	<epod>	askar, waiiit... how did you remove this ATI driver?
04:17	<spikeb>	JC_Denton_: dunno what the vlc package is called
04:17	<smt6k>	Suspend to RAM is now broken in feisty, can anyone tell me how to debug it?
04:17	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb, ty will try now
04:17	<spikeb>	JC_Denton_: yw
04:17	<hordur>	does anyone have any further troubleshooting steps for me?
04:17	<ryeth25>	anybody know how to change background color in my bash terminal?
04:18	<epod>	askar, was it fglrx you installed?
04:18	<tarelerulz>	I am sure you can get someone that know more then I know for sure  ELsni
04:18	<delire>	hordur: i don't know. can you paste your ifconfig output?
04:18	<kakaboy>	Hi guys. I just downloaded 7.04 and I'm trying to detach myself from winxp. I have never worked with linux. My main issue now is connecting to the net. With windows I have cable modem connected through VPN PPTP VPN. How can I get it to work with ubuntu?
04:18	<sixth>	magnetron: CompositeManager/Beryl - this is what i need to add?
04:18	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb, will it override my firefox mplayer plugin in ff?
04:18	<askar>	epod: fglrx?
04:18	<xtknight>	LjL, pjesi it said something about "-classic" i think i saw you guys talking about it earlier.  as we speak stuff is g++ing successfully so far
04:18	<spikeb>	hmm
04:18	<mrcreativity>	delire:
04:18	<epod>	askar, you said you installed an ati driver.  Which one?
04:18	<LjL>	xtknight: yeah, g++ runs for a while
04:18	<spikeb>	JC_Denton_: honestly, im not sure. if it doesn't you can remove the mplayer plugin to test.
04:18	<xtknight>	yeah it failed
04:18	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: how do u connect to the internet?
04:18	<hordur>	delire, i can get you specific info, but i cannot paste anything since the computer is not reachable over network.
04:18	<HYPOCRISY>	dunno
04:18	<epod>	askar, the proprietary one?
04:18	<hajhouse>	i have a problem with aptitude: it hangs at 'Building dependency tree... 50%'
04:18	<delire>	hordur: i understand.. one moment
04:19	<askar>	epod: dont know.. the one that was in restricted drivers manager
04:19	<LjL>	xtknight: right now i'm not very sure anymore whether that -classic thing has any relevancy...
04:19	<sree>	hi.. i am not able to upgrade edgy to feisty
04:19	<elsni>	tarelerulz: i see. Thank you!
04:19	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: via direct ethernet cable directly to the wall socket. ipv4, dhcp
04:19	<pjesi>	xtknight: yes in coral/makefile.swig, SWIGBIN = swig -classic
04:19	<epod>	askar, yeah that'd be the one.  It broke your mesagl probably.
04:19	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb.. k will do.. I hope it works for opera anyhow
04:19	<xtknight>	pjesi, ahh
04:19	<askar>	epod: oh ok
04:19	<mrcreativity>	delire: please help me, i dont understand, obviously im a noob
04:19	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: does the machine have more than one network device ? ...
04:19	<askar>	epod: can I repair it?
04:19	<Huffalump>	Is it possible to launch the Restricted Devices Manager from command line?
04:19	<chrissi>	xtknight: here again: Found Solution
04:20	<sree>	Help with upgrading EDGY to FEISTY please
04:20	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: no, not currently only ethernet
04:20	<magnetron>	sixth: you need Xgl
04:20	<Daverocks>	!upgrade | sree
04:20	<ubotu>	sree: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
04:20	<XiXaQ>	There used to be problems with running more than 3 Xen guests in ubuntu. Has that been fixed?
04:20	<elsni>	please: how can I get a higher screen resolution than 1600xsomething (i.e. 1920x1200) with closed source ATI driver?
04:20	<chrissi>	xtknight: The update-manager notices that there is a new release
04:20	<sree>	ubontu - yeah I followed that
04:20	<xtknight>	chrissi, yeah?
04:20	<sree>	but i stopped on some 3rd party repos
04:20	<sixth>	magnetron: Xgl? are you sure? last time i used ubuntu (dapper) i used aiglx
04:20	<chrissi>	xtnight: and writes that in the file ~/.update-manager/meta-release
04:20	<abdelrahman>	hi, i been looking for codecs to run my video files , i need MKV, AVI , OGG, any thing and every thing
04:20	<nexact>	I think I found a bug, XDMCP by default listen on udp6 and not udp.. netstat -l | grep xdmcp -->	udp6       0      0 *:xdmcp                 *:*.. is There a way to make sure that XDMCP is listening on UDPv4 and not UDPv6 ?
04:20	<sree>	then i removed them from repo list
04:21	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: ok ... it might be that the network card has been assigned i different device (happend to me) ... but i have wireless and wired network cards (laptop)
04:21	<MistaED>	is there a problem with the current 96xx driver in ubuntu not working with geforce3's? my dad upgraded from edgy to feisty and now 3D acceleration doesn't work, however the driver starts up fine and the xorg log doesn't say anything wrong other than some fatal error and reverting to PCI mode
04:21	<chrissi>	xtknight: If there is an entry for feisty already it thinks the update occured
04:21	<psycop>	guys
04:21	<abdelrahman>	a good player would be helpful too
04:21	<MistaED>	however it works fine for everything else except for 3D acceleration
04:21	<psycop>	how do i install 8800gts drivers?
04:21	<xtknight>	chrissi, weird.  maybe you should submit a bug
04:21	<ceil420>	/usr/local/bin/ut: 29: Syntax error: Bad substitution    <=- how do i make that a *good* substitution? :x
04:21	<magnetron>	sixth: you did? AIGLX doesn't work with the proprietary ATI driver
04:21	<chrissi>	xtknight: just remove .update-manager from home
04:21	<askar>	epod:can I repair  mesagl?
04:21	<Tom47>	Huffalump: sudo restricted-manager
04:21	<bliz0r>	:o didnt even see I had IRC running :D
04:21	<magnetron>	psycop: system->administration->restricted driver manager
04:21	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: it was working earlier today, the only difference is that i upgraded to 6.10. nothing else got installed/added/modified
04:22	<delire>	mrcreativity: do you know where to find a terminal?
04:22	<sixth>	magnetron: i remember using it with beryl, worked great for me
04:22	<psycop>	magnetron they screwed up my system
04:22	<benpicco>	fiery_cleric: strange, whatever I do, the blinkenlights on the modem say, thet it\'s doing nothing, no matter what port i choose, is there a terminal command that does the same as the button I\'m searching for?
04:22	<psycop>	had to remove them
04:22	<delire>	mrcreativity: we'll type in a couple of commands to get output quickly.
04:22	<mrcreativity>	delire: yes i do
04:22	<xtknight>	LjL, pjesi have you manually compiled swig yet?
04:22	<Huffalump>	Tom47, thanks!
04:22	<xtknight>	im just using multiverse swig
04:22	<magnetron>	!doesn't work >	psycop
04:22	<chrissi>	xtknight: that explains the weird behaviour for root mode: the first time i run it for root it creates the .update-manager directory there
04:22	<mrcreativity>	delire: yes sir
04:22	<MistaED>	psycop: got feisty? get the nvidia-glx-new package instead, they work for the geforce 8 series
04:22	<Whtiger>	My nice box just restarted for no reason. Logs don't say anything. There wasn't a power outage.
04:22	<chowmeined>	Whenever I change a partition in feisty it is automatically mounted, this is really annoying how do I turn this off?
04:22	<pjesi>	xtknight: I also use that
04:22	<Huffalump>	Tom47, sudo: restricted-manager: command not found
04:22	<delire>	mrcreativity: start up a terminal and type in it 'lsmod | grep snd-hda-intel' and give me the output (should just be one line)
04:22	<fiery_cleric>	benpicco: thats beyond my ubuntu/debian knowledge sorry ... maybe ubotu knows
04:22	<fiery_cleric>	!ppp
04:22	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ppp - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
04:22	<xtknight>	chrissi, ohh?
04:22	<psycop>	MistaED where from?
04:23	<bliz0r>	I got this panel, any way to remove the bars in the end of it?
04:23	<fiery_cleric>	!pppd
04:23	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about pppd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
04:23	<fiery_cleric>	!modem
04:23	<ubotu>	You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto
04:23	<Tom47>	Huffalump werx here
04:23	<mrcreativity>	delire: i get usage lsmod
04:23	<MistaED>	psycop: where the regular nvidia-glx don't for the 8 series, system >	administration >	synaptic package manager
04:23	<Whtiger>	My logs have normal stuff, and then wham-- A reboot.
04:23	<Huffalump>	Tom47, I am plagued for days with this.  Thanks though :)
04:23	<hordur>	is there any way to force recheck dhcp server?
04:23	<fiery_cleric>	!modem | benpicco
04:23	<ubotu>	benpicco: please see above
04:23	<xtknight>	hordur, sudo dhclient IFname
04:23	<qebab>	does anyone know a software for cutting audio files?
04:23	<Whtiger>	Did my computer gain AI and decide to kill iteself?
04:23	<qebab>	Whtiger: devolution :)
04:23	<Horscht>	because you shouldn't have raped it :D
04:23	<balor>	qebab: Jokosher
04:23	<masked_marsoe>	qebab: audacity
04:23	<delire>	mrcreativity: don't type in the apostrophes
04:23	<qebab>	okay, thanks
04:24	<jack>	qebab: audacity?
04:24	<tarelerulz>	Do any of you know how to make mplayer play more then one music file from command line?
04:24	<taneli>	i
04:24	<mrcreativity>	i havent
04:24	<chrissi>	xtknight: when it's run for the second time in root mode there is the feisty entry in meta-release already and nothing is displayed
04:24	<Marcopolo1974ch>	hi there .... is there anyone out there who has expierence how to set up a wirless internet in ubuntu .... (I am a Linux Rookie)
04:24	<xtknight>	tarelerulz, surely a playlist or somethin
04:24	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: what does ifconfig -a give u?
04:24	<magnetron>	sixth either use FOSS ati driver+ aiglx OR proprietary driver+xgl
04:24	<balor>	tarelerulz: try mpg123
04:24	<chrissi>	xtknight: definitly a bug
04:24	<delire>	mrcreativity: so, there's no output from that command at all? try to 'sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel'
04:24	<mrcreativity>	and when i cut and paste what u said, nothing happens.
04:24	<xtknight>	chrissi, well put it on launchapd ;)
04:24	<smt6k>	Is there someway I can go back to 6.10?  Or at least make the power management go back so that suspend works again?
04:24	<xtknight>	launchpad*
04:24	<balor>	tarelerulz: try or music123
04:24	<Horscht>	anyways. How can I have Videos shown when using the open source ati driver?
04:24	<Itchy>	hi do you guys know what is the technology used in linux for access conrol ? i know its not the posix acl standard thingy...
04:24	<abdelrahman>	anyone? i been looking for codecs to run my video files , i need MKV, AVI , OGG, any thing and every thing
04:24	<chrissi>	no account there
04:24	<xtknight>	abdelrahman, VLC cant do it?
04:24	<mrcreativity>	nope, nothing
04:24	<Whtiger>	well.. guess I can update the kernal now..
04:24	<Horscht>	when i use the open source driver i get only a black rectangle where the video should be
04:24	<delire>	mrcreativity: there should be no output from that last command.
04:24	<balor>	abdelrahman: OGG is there by default in Totem
04:24	<ceil420>	abdelrahman, VLC?
04:24	<Tom47>	Huffalump is the package installed there? if it is then sydnaptic will tell you were it is and you should then be able to sudo it
04:24	<smt6k>	tarelerulz, you can do "mplayer file file2 file3" etc.
04:24	<abdelrahman>	it can but low quality =/
04:24	<joshjosh>	update manager says my system is up to date...but i haven't updated in over a week. I want to update to feisty final...
04:25	<delire>	mrcreativity: good. now use the up arrow and find the earlier command. try it now.
04:25	<mrcreativity>	delire: ur right....no ouput
04:25	<balor>	abdelrahman: you need to install gstreamer-plugins-bad and gstreamer-plugins-ugly
04:25	<joshjosh>	and yes, dist-upgrade tells me 0 upgraded packages
04:25	<ceil420>	heh
04:25	<masked_marsoe>	joshjosh: you have it already
04:25	<delire>	mrcreativity: the lsmod  | grep snd-hda-intel
04:25	<xtknight>	abdelrahman, low quality? hmm like what?  no deblocking?
04:25	<magnetron>	!final >	joshjosh
04:25	<tarelerulz>	<smt6k>	I thought that ,but I was not sure. I just read on how to make mplayer mplay one song for every
04:25	<mrcreativity>	nothing again
04:25	<joshjosh>	masked_marsoe, hmm...but i haven't updated in 4-5 days.
04:25	<joshjosh>	Minus an update manager update. that's it
04:25	<VividHazE>	this might sound like a stupid question, but how do I stop the X Server so I can install nvidia Drivers?
04:25	<delire>	mrcreativity: hmm.. odd. how about 'lsmod | grep hda'
04:25	<abdelrahman>	no my files are all HQ and were clear on windows , here it is kinda blurry
04:26	<tarelerulz>	I just want to see if anyone else might know for sure
04:26	<joshjosh>	VividHazE, why would you need to stop it?
04:26	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: ifconfig -a gives me some info, no collisions or nothing. gets hardware address.. is there anything in particular there that would intrest you?
04:26	<VividHazE>	it says I need to kill the Xserver before I can install the drivers
04:26	<masked_marsoe>	joshjosh, yeah... i asked the same question earlier, there was no changes between the beta and the final
04:26	<sree>	Anyone out there who can help me Upgrade Edgy to Feisty ?
04:26	<kbrooks>	any decent browser that does not take up too much memory?
04:26	<joshjosh>	thanks masked_marsoe
04:26	<joshjosh>	seriously no changed?
04:26	<mrcreativity>	wait...i see something
04:26	<kbrooks>	<masked_marsoe>	joshjosh, yeah... i asked the same question earlier, there was no changes between the beta and the final # no
04:26	<ceil420>	/usr/local/bin/ut: 29: Syntax error: Bad substitution    <=- how do i make that a *good* substitution? :x
04:26	<Horscht>	Opera, kbrooks
04:26	<kbrooks>	joshjosh, wrong
04:26	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: so you have an eth0 with an ip address?
04:26	<delire>	mrcreativity: paste the one line output here.
04:27	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: no ip. (at least not that i can find)
04:27	<VividHazE>	I clicked CTRL+ALT+F4, but I need to know the command to kill the xserver, anyone help me?
04:27	<mrcreativity>	delire: there are quite a few lines actually
04:27	<sree>	Anyone out there who can help me Upgrade Edgy to Feisty ?
04:27	<jisatsu>	still no improvement. there's two connections, wmaster0 and wlan0, I tried setting up the details on both but it still doesn't seem to connect or anything
04:27	<joshjosh>	sree,  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
04:27	<masked_marsoe>	kbrooks, what do you mean??
04:27	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: ok ... so its detected but not started
04:27	<delire>	mrcreativity: do you see one _like_ snd_hda_intel ?
04:27	<delire>	mrcreativity: any that begin with 'snd'..
04:27	<kbrooks>	masked_marsoe, u really mean the _rc_
04:27	<askar>	Is it possible to repair mesagl???
04:27	<mrcreativity>	snd_hda_intel          21912  1
04:27	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: u could try sudo ifup eth0
04:27	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: dont know. it doesnt behave like mac (my main OS) so im drawing blanks...
04:27	<delire>	mrcreativity: cool... so, try to play some music now..
04:28	<mrcreativity>	will stuff from my windows partition work?
04:28	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: gets eth0 already configured
04:28	<sree>	joshjosh, doesn't work
04:28	<delire>	mrcreativity: probably, though try a wave file for now.
04:28	<VividHazE>	HOW DID I KILL THE XSERVER, is there a command?
04:28	<delire>	VividHazE: CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
04:28	<VividHazE>	doesn't that restart it?  I want it to stay off, so i'm in text mode
04:28	<Linuturk>	hey guys, my menus aren't sorting entries alphabetically anymore. When I add an application, it doesn't got in ABC order
04:28	<benpicco>	fiery_cleric: thx, I\'ll read this
04:28	<kbrooks>	VividHazE, CUT THE CAPS
04:29	<Daverocks>	VividHazE: if you don't have a display manager running, it's killed
04:29	<ompaul>	VividHazE, NO CAPS please, so /etc/init.d gdm stop
04:29	<xtknight>	pjesi, LjL did you come across "no pyuic found" ?
04:29	<delire>	VividHazE: just go to a console CTRL-ALT-F1 [F2, F3, F4 etc] 
04:29	<VividHazE>	thanks
04:29	<sree>	joshjosh, I saw feisty upgrade on  update-manager then did that. it hung on 3rd party repo with error
04:29	<Daverocks>	VividHazE: but you likely have gdm or something similar running, in which gdm will restart X. what ompaul said ;)
04:29	<nlap>	
04:29	<joshjosh>	sree, hmm.
04:29	<delire>	VividHazE: get back to X with CTRL-ALT-F7
04:29	<sree>	joshjosh, then I removed the 3rd party repos
04:29	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: have u looked in system->admin->networking ... check the settings ... then deactivate, activate
04:29	<sree>	joshjosh, after that I don't see the option to upgrade
04:30	<pjesi>	xtknight: no I havent seen that before, can you paste the output from make?
04:30	<ompaul>	@now sydney

04:30	<joshjosh>	what's it say when you  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
04:30	<Huffalump>	Tom47, you're a genius!  Thank you very very much!
04:30	<mrcreativity>	delire: it asks me to install some codec
04:30	<ceil420>	/usr/local/bin/ut: 29: Syntax error: Bad substitution    <=- how do i make that a *good* substitution? :x
04:30	<magnetron>	Linuturk: how do you add programs? Are you using Synaptic or add/remove programs?
04:30	<delire>	mrcreativity: do it..
04:30	<jisatsu>	is there a log or anything which lists issues with networking? it could be the wrong type of key or whatever, but it's not telling me
04:30	<mrcreativity>	doing it
04:30	<xtknight>	pjesi, it's an error when i ran where the make script was failling (pyuic_wrapper)_ now i run pyuic_wrapper and i get a valid file, no error
04:30	<Digichrome>	Could someone recommend a linux utility to completely, securely and utterly wipe everything on a hard drive? I've Googled but found nothing useful.
04:30	<xtknight>	pjesi, compiling as we speak
04:30	<Daverocks>	Digichrome: darik's boot and nuke
04:30	<delire>	Digichrome: dd
04:30	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: have checked Networking, how do i deactivate?
04:30	<xtknight>	pjesi, i installed 3 packages that came up on apt-cache search pyuic
04:30	<cb_>	i'm trying to use azureus with ubuntu but the download speed keeps turning to orange and going to 0B/s.  Does anyone know what I need to do?
04:30	<Daverocks>	Digichrome: http://dban.sourceforge.net/
04:30	<Linuturk>	magnetron, both ways. I'm thinking it might be some old .config file in my ~ from the upgrade
04:30	<magnetron>	Digichrome: shred
04:31	<Digichrome>	daverocks: Is that in Ubuntu....oh....nm, thank you
04:31	<xtknight>	pjesi, but i get a different error now :\
04:31	<delire>	Digichrome: dd a disk with 0's. this is reliable, but perhaps there are gui frontends these days.
04:31	<delire>	magnetron: forgot about shred..
04:31	<askar>	Can someone help me make direct rendering work?
04:31	<askar>	It did work before but I did something stupid....
04:31	<askar>	Display controller: Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)

04:31	<Daverocks>	Digichrome: it's not a linux utility, you boot into it, it totally erases every bit on the hard drive

04:31	<Cosmo_>	well that was interesting, finally got my dual monitors working right and the problem ended up being a small flaw in NVIDIA's drivers not linux's fault, the silly software from nvidia wasn't saving the file to the xorg.conf like I was telling it to do
04:31	<xtknight>	pjesi, type this to get farther.  "sudo apt-get install pyqt-tools python-kde3-dev pyqt4-dev-tools"
04:31	<xtknight>	pjesi, then type "make clean" and "make"
04:31	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: i use dapper ... so dont know if its the same on your machine but u should be able activate / deactivate network connections
04:31	<Daverocks>	Digichrome: no problem
04:31	<patrick__>	can anyone help me Im trying to fix a few things after a fresh install of feisty.  When I log out the screen hangs? it just stays blank until I have to hold down the power button on this laptop which I hate doing! Im just after restarting after doing the "acpi=force" entry on the kernel line of "menu.lst" then I did "dmesg | less" and pasted the output here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16805/
04:31	<Digichrome>	daverocks, delire, thank you...that'll get me there.
04:32	<delire>	tmccrar1: it's not? why so?
04:32	<matason>	Hi I'm getting an error when running "sudo make" ->	"error: stdio.h: No such file or directory", this is when I'm try to install madwifi - any ideas?
04:32	<sky__shark>	so  the firefox that came with ubuntu 7.04, is that firefox 2 because I've noticed that there's no option to acess the menu that adjusts the home page, saved password manager etc.  like on the windows version of firefox
04:32	<magnetron>	!upgrade>	sree
04:32	<pjesi>	xtknight: compiling
04:32	<tmccrar1>	delire: If you do that, your data is still recoverable. You need to make sure there's no trace of the old bits on the platters
04:32	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: i found it :) sorry for noob-questions... :)
04:32	<askar>	Can someone help me make direct rendering work?
04:32	<askar>	It did work before but I did something stupid....
04:32	<askar>	Display controller: Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)
04:32	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: no problem... does it work
04:32	<mrcreativity>	delire: it works! thank you thank you thank you
04:32	<tmccrar1>	delire: you need to essentially "wash" the disk with garbage data so there is no trace
04:32	<hajhouse>	matason: you might need to install libc6-dev
04:33	<matason>	hajhouse: Oke thanks, I'll try that
04:33	<magnetron>	sky__shark: it is there, check the edit menu?
04:33	<erUSUL>	magnetron: install build-essential
04:33	<ryeth25>	anybody familiar with bash termimal and changing background colors??
04:33	<ryeth25>	it's set at a basic white
04:33	<sky__shark>	oh okay thanks
04:33	<magnetron>	erUSUL: not mee
04:33	<masked_marsoe>	is there a way to rollback to 6.10?
04:33	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: you just need to write /dev/urandom over it
04:33	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: you can change than in the terminal program (not bash)
04:33	<erUSUL>	magnetron: ups, sorry ;)
04:34	<sky__shark>	its my first day on ubuntu
04:34	<britta_>	Good afternoon
04:34	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: once would do, twice would be better
04:34	<tmccrar1>	gordonjcp: What do you think urandom outputs? ;)
04:34	<Ansgri>	Hi! Can anybody help me? In what file does gnome-power-manager load in Ubuntu?
04:34	<erUSUL>	matason: install build-essential
04:34	<magnetron>	sky__shark: found it?
04:34	<britta_>	I have a question
04:34	<sky__shark>	yeah
04:34	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: randomish crap
04:34	<sky__shark>	i did
04:34	<delire>	tmccrar1: can't you just dd if=/dev/zero bs=2048 of=/mnt/disk/somefile  and then use something like wipe afterwards?
04:34	<britta_>	Is static IP WPA possible on Feisty?
04:34	<ryeth25>	hajhouse:  i thought the terminal was bash
04:34	<tmccrar1>	gordonjcp: Exactly garbage data
04:34	<Cosmo_>	moving on to the next problem, since installing Feisty I now have no sound
04:34	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: bash is the shell
04:34	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: actually if you *really* wanted it to be pretty random, you'd dd /dev/audio over it and feed in white noise
04:34	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: bash runs in the terminal
04:34	<britta_>	Cosmo_ the same happens to me!!!
04:34	<matason>	erUSUL: Ok thanks, libc6-dev aswell?
04:34	<britta_>	No sound
04:34	<jisatsu>	delire: http://pastebin.ca/451421 when I try to enable wlan0
04:35	<ryeth25>	ahh
04:35	<delire>	hordur: what was the fix?
04:35	<sutabi>	Anyone have exp with ATI and feisty? :\ I've tried everything in the guides but nothing is working and my Rad 9600 with has no acceration.
04:35	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: but forget having to do 2000 passes or whatever people say you need
04:35	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: tryed both enable/disable aswell as using manual ip and then change back to dhcp. still no go..
04:35	<tmccrar1>	gordonjcp: Just once wouldn't do the trick, you'd do that mulitple times
04:35	<erUSUL>	matason: build-essential installs libc6-dev iirc
04:35	<hordur>	delire: still no internet.. :(
04:35	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: once the data is overwritten once, the old data is gone forever
04:35	<Cosmo_>	britta_: find a solution yet?
04:35	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: unless you're using a very old drive
04:35	<tmccrar1>	gordonjcp: Not always
04:35	<matason>	erUSUL: Oke thanks very much
04:35	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: you are probably using gnome-terminal; try 'Edit ->	Current profile' from the menubar
04:35	<britta_>	Cosmo_ no, not yet....
04:35	<erUSUL>	matason: no problem
04:35	<pjesi>	xtknight: it leaves me with the python errors
04:35	<sutabi>	I cant bearly run Gaim, and my computer is laggy graphically
04:35	<britta_>	that's what I'm here
04:36	<xtknight>	pjesi, same here
04:36	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: well no, but then if you're trying to destroy confidential data on an MFM or RLL drive you've got a whole 'nother set of problems... ;-)
04:36	<delire>	jisatsu: are you using network manager?
04:36	<sree>	magnetron, I have issues with upgrade after following the notes
04:36	<delire>	hordur: odd. was it working previously?
04:36	<sree>	Anyone out there who can help me Upgrade Edgy to Feisty ?
04:36	<sree>	Anyone out there who can help me Upgrade Edgy to Feisty ?
04:36	<sky__shark>	i've noticed while audio playback of flash files, music, mpeg etc... sounds weird/diffrent from windows maybe its just me but its weird
04:36	<qebab>	okay, so I installed Audacity, and it says I need libmp3lame.so but I can't actually find that lib. I've tried sudo apt-get install, but it says I have it already, I just can't find it on my hdd. Does anyone know where it would land?

04:36	<^Lestat>	im sooo lost
04:36	<hordur>	delire: ya, without a hitch in 6.06
04:37	<jisatsu>	delire: I uninstalled network-manager from apt, that was when I used System, Admin, Network
04:37	<Daverocks>	erUSUL: he/she's been give !upgrade about 3 or 4 times onw lol
04:37	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: pretty much any drive that anyone in here is likely to have will have the data flattened beyond any chance of recovery with just a couple of passes

04:38	<askar>	It did work before but I did something stupid....

04:39	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: what have u got as default gateway device?
04:39	<delire>	jisatsu: realtek seems to be a real problem card in this release..

04:40	<pjesi>	xtknight: everything should be in that archive
04:40	<qebab>	stupid me, ubuntuforums had the answer
04:40	<jack>	qebab: go to /usr/lib and search if you have that library
04:40	<jisatsu>	delire: just nVidia. the drivers themselves are open source
04:40	<xtknight>	pjesi, yeah the script seems to be installing libcoral improperly, though
04:40	<qebab>	jack: found it, thanks
04:40	<jack>	qebab: ok...
04:40	<pjesi>	perhaps
04:41	<icy>	hello, I have installed feisty on my macbook but I can't get the wireless lan working. I followed the wiki and installed the windows drivers with ndiswrapper but there is no "wlan0" when doing ifconfig. Any ideas?
04:41	<delire>	jisatsu: i'm sorry but i can't help further. all i can suggest is that you look in the forums for now.
04:41	<KevinU>	Ive just installed Ubuntu 7.04 Desktop, and i wounder if someone have a guide for LAMP?
04:41	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: it should be in networking window.... basically u should have device called eth0 ... and that should be the device that is the default gateway device
04:41	<MistaED>	psycop: ok you may need to edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add that resolution in manually, i think there's a cool wiki on how to do this exactly on wiki.ubuntu.com
04:41	<xtknight>	!lamp | KevinU
04:41	<ubotu>	KevinU: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
04:41	<KevinU>	Ive got one before but dont have it left
04:41	<delire>	jisatsu: if it's a popular chipset there will be a fix very soon.
04:41	<finn>	are nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-common all I need in order to get the nvidia driver running?

04:41	<sky__shark>	i have a question about virus shields, how do i get one for ubuntu?
04:41	<jisatsu>	delire: ok, np :) will I be able to install the drivers I had with Edgy in Feisty? might work for the time being
04:41	<ffm>	I created the QEmu project in launchpad, but I have no affiliation with it. How can I give the rights of the project on Launchpad over to the rightful (c) owner, Fabrice Bellard?

04:42	<delire>	jisatsu: unfortunately i'd doubt it..
04:42	<xtknight>	Dralid, probably you will be fine.  i'd install tomboy first on the other PC, THEN copy over ~/.tomboy
04:42	<jisatsu>	delire: ok
04:42	<erUSUL>	sky__shark: you do not need one unless you want it to protect windows computers

04:42	<delire>	jisatsu: i'll have a quick look..
04:42	<finn>	delire, I installed a command-line system.    so    apt-get install   those, then run nvidia-xconfig  and I'm done?
04:42	<jisatsu>	how do I use that command?
04:43	<psycop>	what site?

04:43	<hak5fan>	Hi is there something like a minimal ubuntu installation cd?
04:43	<Samus_Aran>	does anyone know how to get the nVIDIA legacy kernel module installed on Feisty Fawn ?  it no longer has an installable package as near as I can tell, yet it has the Xorg driver package
04:43	<sky__shark>	so linux doesn't need a virus shield, that's gonna take some getting used to.  I used to be windows only so I guess I'm still used to needing it.
04:43	<delire>	finn: i beleive so, but the restricted driver manager may be more reliable.
04:43	<meanfish>	hak5fan:  how minimal are you looking for?
04:43	<sree>	Guys why isn't anyone responding about the upgrade  - ain't you getting my messages ?
04:43	<delire>	finn: no hard trying..

04:44	<delire>	jisatsu: that's paste the full name of the card again?
04:44	<hordur>	delire: UG is listed on the second line, eth0 but it looks very much the same as the first line where it only says U. what info do you want?

04:47	<hak5fan>	meanfish: I've used something like it before.. and I don't really mind working from the shell
04:47	<magnetron>	!codecs >	qaldune
04:47	<delire>	icy: do you see a device with wireless extensions there?
04:47	<Shironeko2>	any reason why sound could have stopped working?
04:47	<zelrikriando>	I almost got my sound card working....almost
04:47	<hordur>	delire: my isp appearantly has a bunch so its always changing.. will try ping now :)
04:47	<icy>	lo        no wireless extensions. and eth0      no wireless extensions.
04:47	<fiery_cleric>	!sound
04:47	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
04:47	<synthesetic>	isconnected
04:47	<idefixx>	is there a gui to configure compiz?
04:47	<qaldune>	it's not a matter of codecs
04:47	<Samus_Aran>	ceil420: it means that your X server (graphics display) does not have support for accellerated OpenGL (2D and 3D graphics)
04:48	<qaldune>	it's a matter of swiftfox
04:48	<hordur>	delire: yes, ping does respond :D
04:48	<delire>	icy: sorry, no idea. does the card require firmware or something?
04:48	<hak5fan>	meanfish: but I'm planning to make it a desktop system so I'm not sure whether a server install is a good idea or not
04:48	<firefoxman>	Is there a way to have someone verify my PGP key without having to meet them in person?
04:48	<Hasrat_USA>	idefixx nope but you can configure it using terminal
04:48	<zelrikriando>	cannot open volume control lol
04:48	<Samus_Aran>	ceil420: normally this is because you're using a basic driver for your graphics card
04:48	<delire>	hordur: wow.. odd. so you do have an IP on that device?
04:48	<zelrikriando>	I broke it
04:48	<Kyral>	firefoxman: Thats NOT smart
04:48	<icy>	delire: it's exactly the same card as in the wiki article :(
04:48	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: appearantly i have a working gatway at least, even tho i cant find exactly what you ask of me
04:48	<ceil420>	Samus_Aran, again with the nvidia drivers, then? ><
04:48	<Hasrat_USA>	idefixx: beryl has full blown gui though
04:48	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: yep i know, thx just wanted to know if i was to blind to find it
04:48	<cow_2001>	while updating to 7.04, i chose "all" in the mdadm configuration dialogue. now the system doesn't load.
04:48	<meanfish>	hak5fan:  hm...xubuntu might be an option.  not sure how big it is in terms of hd space though.
04:48	<Samus_Aran>	ceil420: if they aren't installed/set up properly, then you would get that, yes
04:48	<cow_2001>	i guess i should have chose "none" instead
04:48	<Hasrat_USA>	dont waste time on compiz get beryl
04:49	<delire>	icy: oh.. i think you're best to make a forum post, or at leat look in the forums.

04:49	<KnightGeek>	When I boot off of the Install CD, Ubuntu hangs at the USB drivers. Can I get some help?
04:49	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: was looking for that in compiz... and u got to admit its kind of strange a tool like this does not have a config gui ;)
04:49	<zelrikriando>	do you know how to fix the volume control?
04:49	<ceil420>	Samus_Aran, how do i install/set it up properly? i've gone back and forth too many times to remember which one's right ;x
04:49	<magnetron>	firefoxman: yes, you can let SOMEONE YOU KNOW sign it with their PGP/GPG key
04:49	<icy>	delire: ok, thanks anyway
04:49	<meanfish>	askar:  that doesn't look like an ati driver at all...are you using an ati card?
04:49	<hak5fan>	meanfish: I don't want to end up with an installation less than 256 megs I just need the installation utility to fit on my 256 megs flash drive
04:49	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: what do get when u just type ifconfig ... what devices (on left)
04:49	<delire>	icy: perhaps ask if anyone here runs Feisty on a macbook.

04:51	<Batty|Laptop>	i've setup a network between Ubuntu on a laptop and vista home premium on 3 different systems all systems see each other fine, ubuntu can see and connect to all vista systems but non of the vista system can connect to the ubuntu system even thou they see it, logon/pw are correct, (1st problem) 2nd problem is ubuntu system can access vista systems and see files in shared folders but its unable to take the files from the vista

04:51	<delire>	hordur: no idea. i think your router is having a fit..
04:51	<hordur>	beutiful :D
04:51	<delire>	hordur: cool ;)
04:51	<Hasrat_USA>	idefixx: yeah i agree. i have been using Beryl ever since its inception and for some reasons never wanted to use compiz. but after i upgraded to feisty fawn compiz came preinstalled in it and out of curiosity i turned it on only to see some minimizing and maximizing effects and a crappy 3d desktop cube and poor default refresh rate. anyways i believe the version of compiz that came with feisty is simple and easy to configure even for
04:51	<Hasrat_USA>	a noob whereas Beryl's GUI and its myriads of options and a lack of documentation might scare a newbie at the beginning
04:51	<GoDawgs>	hey everyone... I'm curious... has anyone gotten a laptop to work with an external monitor with ubuntu?

04:52	<Hasrat_USA>	idefixx: by the way for your info, beryl and compiz are merging and something awesome is coming up and that's all i can tell ya
04:52	<meanfish>	askar:  in console try this:  lsmod | grep fglrx
04:52	<bulmer>	icy: that gives you a clue that wlan0 is not there yet if not on that dir i pasted
04:52	<hak5fan>	meanfish: U see, I need to reinstall, unless someone has a good answer to why my mic volume is very low even though mic volume is set to max on the mixer. The mic workes great in Windblows, but don't want to go back to it. Well and since I upgraded from edgy to feisty I don't have a feisty install cd, and becaus my room is flodding with install discs I don't want to burn an other cd

04:52	<delire>	hordur:  a pleasure.
04:52	<Hasrat_USA>	ceil420: which distro?
04:53	<mphill>	ceil420, any version of the proprietary driver will do
04:53	<askar>	meanfish: no output
04:53	<icy>	bulmer: yes, ifconfig isn't showing it too
04:53	<GoDawgs>	vega__: Did you use a gui to set it up?  I have an ATI 200M (mobility) card... and I can't find any tools to do it
04:53	<ceil420>	Hasrat_USA, Xubuntu Feisty
04:53	<icy>	bulmer: any clue how to get it there?
04:53	<Batty|Laptop>	its setup on all vista system yes, had to do that manually as it was not installed automatically but i can recheck
04:53	<cow_2001>	I don't have raid. while updating mdadm I chose, without understanding, "all" instead of "none" in the mdadm dialogue. now the system doesn't loads. What should I do to get it working again?
04:53	<faceface>	wow... buisy today
04:53	<delire>	faceface: too busy..
04:53	<KnightGeek>	help me with USB issue please
04:53	<firefoxman>	magnetron: So, how do I know if anyone I know has a PGP key?
04:53	<meanfish>	askar:  hm.  ok.  probably a dumb question, but if you run the following what do you get:  glxinfo | grep direct
04:53	<magnetron>	firefoxman: there is keyservers, the default GPG setup has the most common enabled by default. don't know how to search it though, there is a GPG gui for ubuntu
04:53	<vega__>	GoDawgs: with 6.10 it will start automaticly
04:53	<faceface>	delire, yup... what is your question
04:53	<bulmer>	icy: what is the result of your loading of ndiswrapper?
04:53	<Hasrat_USA>	ceil420: i thought the upgrader notified you saying that a newer version of your nvidia driver files were available?
04:53	<firefoxman>	magnetron: Thanks
04:53	<askar>	meanfish: direct rendering: No
04:53	<delire>	faceface: i have none. helping here.
04:54	<icy>	bulmer: no errors if you mean that
04:54	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: thx i was reading up on that at the beryl forum a few days ago. never used compiz just beryl and wanted to try it out, cauz its allready on it right now
04:54	<GoDawgs>	vega__: Nope... I'm using the feisty release and can't modify the second monitor's resolution
04:54	<bulmer>	icy which chip does your wifi uses?
04:54	<ceil420>	Hasrat_USA, i've changed the nvidia drivers back and forth a couple of times now ;x
04:54	<faceface>	delire, great! I want to get this 'media keyboard' functional under ubuntu... namely the voume knob
04:54	<fiery_cleric>	Batty|Laptop: about problem 2 ... are they public shares?
04:54	<firefoxman>	magnetron: What are the best keyservers?
04:54	<KnightGeek>	somebody help me with booting off of the CD
04:54	<vega__>	its in xorg.conf
04:54	<Tom47>	nexact ssh based solutions can be fun ... eg http://www.vanemery.com/Linux/XoverSSH/X-over-SSH2.html
04:54	<KnightGeek>	it hangs at USB driver
04:54	<faceface>	KnightGeek, what is the problem
04:54	<faceface>	oh
04:54	<icy>	bulmer: atheros wifi
04:55	<GoDawgs>	vega__: maybe so, but i've been really good at making black screens! :)  do you know of a gui to do it?
04:55	<KnightGeek>	how do I fix?
04:55	<faceface>	KnightGeek, have you a ps2 kbd + mouse?
04:55	<magnetron>	firefoxman: most of them sync with eachother, use any of them
04:55	<sky__shark>	So one final question from me for a while, does linux have anti spyware/ anti adware programs or is that a non issue as well?
04:55	<hak5fan>	KnightGeek: try unplugging all unneeded usb devices
04:55	<tue>	Hello. I have some serious network issues. I installed kubuntu feisty fawn on this computer 3 weeks ago, and after the official version was released i tried running adept to update the system. However, one package (dont know which) failed, and after this eth0 has failed. The only non-standard thing about the setup is that i has (by accident) run sudo chown (myusername) /etc -R. I has tried to correct this by running sudo chown root /etc -R.
04:55	<tue>	Basically the problem is that when i run sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart i get a lot of problems like SIOCSIFFLAGS: Permission Denied, and eth0 does not get an ip (i cannot even ping the router)
04:55	<icy>	02:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications, Inc. Unknown device 0024 (rev 01)
04:55	<firefoxman>	magnetron: Thanks.
04:55	<askar>	meanfish: someone else tought that my mesagl is something wrong with.. can that be the case?
04:55	<KnightGeek>	yes, but I use USB desktop set
04:55	<vega__>	GoDawgs: sorry no i dont
04:55	<jack>	sky_shark: the last one I think...
04:55	<bulmer>	icy those are supported..check what you have in /lib/firmware/`uname -r`   btw you proly dont need ndiswrapper for atheros
04:55	<delire>	faceface: try running 'xev' and pressing that button/dial
04:55	<GoDawgs>	vega__: Thanks. :)
04:56	<GoDawgs>	Does anyone know a gui to change the resolution of a 2nd monitor used in Feisty?
04:56	<delire>	faceface: if you get no output, it can never be used in Ubuntu. it's locked up in proprietary land.
04:56	<hak5fan>	KnightGeek: Which cd are you using?
04:56	<faceface>	delire, I see
04:56	<KnightGeek>	Fiesty i386
04:56	<icy>	bulmer: I'm not sure what there should be in /lib/firmware/....
04:56	<meanfish>	askar:  I mean, it could.  Mesa is what it falls back to though so I doubt that it would be broken.
04:56	<bulmer>	icy sorry i forgot, which drivers belongs to atheros?
04:56	<Skrotffs>	Duckers_: http://dmy999.com/article/17/linux-raid-lessons-learned

04:58	<faceface>	KnightGeek, not really... you may need a driver disk, but that may be a fedora thing
04:58	<delire>	jisatsu_: wow, great.. i didn't think that'd work across kernel versions!
04:58	<KnightGeek>	ok thanks
04:58	<icy>	bulmer: I'm not sure what you mean.. the file is "net5416.inf"

04:59	<meanfish>	askar:  I cant think of anything else at the moment :/  I'd have to work more with the intel drivers to know the ins and outs.
04:59	<bulmer>	icy: take a look inside it, and attempt to recognize the name of the driver
04:59	<jisatsu_>	delire: I had to recompile it myself :) but it works. how do I submit bugs?
04:59	<crossed>	it does not return to challenge to me with that e
04:59	<bulmer>	icy inf files in windows are text i believe

05:01	<Samus_Aran>	ceil420: you need the linux-restricted-modules one, and the xorg driver one (nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new).  then you need to set your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to use the "nvidia" driver rather than "nv"
05:01	<askar>	meanfish: modprobe i810 what does that do?
05:01	<erUSUL>	sree: do 'rm .update-manager/meta-release' and launch again the update-manager
05:02	<meanfish>	askar:  that loads your intel graphics driver as a kernel module.  that should be done automatically on load.
05:02	<jimbob79>	where is libx11 located?  i have a source code patch i need to apply to get VICE emulator working
05:02	<bulmer>	icy check what you have in /lib/firmware/`uname -r`   if any are ar*
05:02	<Stormx2>	Hey folks. I posted a full explaination of my apt woes. If anyone could help out I'd really appreciate it! Basically the install process seg faulted and now I can do nothing! My forum thread is here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2499455
05:02	<ceil420>	Samus_Aran, it's already set to "nvidia"
05:02	<meanfish>	askar:  meaning, if you did lsmod | grep i810 it would show you a result.
05:02	<icy>	bulmer: nope, no ar*
05:02	<delire>	jimbob79: dpkg -L packagename
05:02	<OuZo>	PriceChild: thanks, ill wait a few weeks then
05:02	<ceil420>	Samus_Aran, and nvidia-glx is already installed
05:03	<sree>	ok
05:03	<PriceChild>	OuZo, you misunderstand me
05:03	<cow_2001>	I don't have raid. while updating mdadm I chose, without understanding, "all" instead of "none" in the mdadm dialogue. now the system doesn't loads. What should I do to get it working again?
05:03	<PriceChild>	OuZo, feisty is released and stable.
05:03	<PriceChild>	OuZo, however why do you want to upgrade if whatever you have now is working fine.
05:03	<demo_>	hello i just installed beryl on feisty, but it doesnt work and doesnt allow beryl being the "window manager", how come?
05:03	<jimbob79>	would libx11.so.6 be the source code file
05:03	<askar>	meanfish: now it works :D
05:03	<bulmer>	icy: i guess you will have to use ndiswrapper then
05:03	<bliz0r>	How to keep my partition disk always mounted? Right now I have to go onto my other disk and type root password to mount it?
05:03	<delire>	jimbob79: no, that's a binary module.
05:03	<sree>	no success
05:03	<icy>	bulmer: yea but that doesn't seem to work either
05:03	<meanfish>	askar:  rock on! :)
05:04	<delire>	jimbob79: you need to grab the source-code and patch that and build it.
05:04	<askar>	meanfish: I get this but it isnt anything bad maybe?
05:04	<askar>	do_wait: drmWaitVBlank returned -1, IRQs don't seem to be working correctly.
05:04	<askar>	Try running with LIBGL_THROTTLE_REFRESH and LIBL_SYNC_REFRESH unset.

05:04	<ubotu>	The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
05:04	<magnetron>	!enter >	askar
05:04	<icy>	ndiswrapper -l says "net5416 : driver installed", so the driver seems to have been loaded fine
05:04	<PriceChild>	jimbob79, i may be being silly, but you may need libX11-dev or some such package for the source
05:04	<bulmer>	icy: maybe madwifi ?
05:04	<nine>	Hi. I've just installed compiz on my fiesty-installation with xfce. How do i get it to work when i'm logging in?
05:04	<jimbob79>	ok
05:04	<OuZo>	PriceChild: just to be using the latest version... i cant up grade now because i am doing some projects... that's why i will wait a week or so. thanks
05:04	<PriceChild>	OuZo, don't risk upgrades. "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
05:04	<icy>	although ndisgtk doesn't list it
05:04	<PriceChild>	OuZo, just because it has a higer versio nnumber doesn't make it better
05:05	<delire>	jimbob79: however that's a serious file to patch.
05:05	<delire>	s/file/library
05:05	<OuZo>	PriceChild: that's a good philosophy
05:05	<bulmer>	icy:  lsmod |grep ath   or maybe lsmod | grep net
05:05	<jimbob79>	well i have a chunk of source code to apply to it, so i'll give it a try
05:05	<zelrikriando>	what s the difference between High Definition Audio Controller and Multimedia audio controller?

05:25	<larson9999>	what's the deal with the 'start button'?  if you use the smaller one, 'main menu' instead of the default one, there is considerable lag before it works.  not sure how the default one behaves as it takes up too much realestate
05:25	<lzap>	hi there
05:25	<zelrikriando>	Help me please

I re-installed Grub using a guide I found on Ubuntu forums, and it now boots into Grub and tries to boot into Ubuntu, but gets hung up shortly after the splash screen. Can anyone help?
05:27	<livecdquickq>	hi. ubuntu as live cd..could i install abiword during this session?

05:27	<tsmithe>	RJ-4945, it rather depends on the chipset inside the card. could you pastebin the output of `lsmod` and `lspci -vvn` please?
05:27	<ceil420>	livecdquickq, i'm pretty sure you have to restart after installing...
05:27	<Stinge1>	simonn - none, just the splash screen goes away and turns into a blinking cursor.
05:27	<ceil420>	livecdquickq, in fact, i seem to remember Edgy's installer telling me that specifically
05:27	<Tom47>	GoDawgs: not keen to play :(
05:27	<abdelrahman>	thanks fixed :)
05:28	<GoDawgs>	Tom47: Yeah, that's what I thought... I'm going to install easyubuntu to see if that resolves the problem

05:31	<Stinge1>	simonn - what IRC client are you using?
05:31	<IndyGunFreak>	!automatix
05:31	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a CLOSED SOURCE script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

05:37	<simonn>	You need to have your home directory on a different partition
05:37	<zelrikriando>	PriceChild , could you help me?
05:37	<Afief>	goose: for that purpose you'd put your home directory on a seperate partition
05:37	<nibsa1242_>	Stingel you probably have to parition yourself, and /home should be its own partition
05:37	<Stinge1>	zbrown... it's not
05:37	<PriceChild>	zelrikriando, what's the question?

05:37	<zbrown>	Stinge1: then you'll need to backup the home drive to a cd or dvd or 2nd hdd, and install
05:37	<nibsa1242_>	Stingel you should back up your /home then
05:38	<zelrikriando>	PriceChild , how do I use the command : echo options [module-name]  [module-options]  | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/[module-name]

05:38	<Tenki>	I need help installing Ubuntu.
05:38	<fabbos>	I just installed upgraded to feisty but now I try to boot and I get a screen and the last thing it does is check filesystems then itis stuck
05:38	<goose>	Afief: goose: for that purpose you'd put your home directory on a seperate partition  < -- i didn't do t hat :| and i have a ton of data in my home partition
05:38	<nibsa1242_>	auridius did you do a CD check?
05:38	<Tenki>	I'm getting this error: http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d66/chickenfingers43/Error.jpg
05:38	<goose>	erm.. root partition
05:38	<Stinge1>	how can i back it up to a cd if my cd drive is being used to boot ubuntu
05:38	<auridius>	nibsal242: nope
05:38	<zelrikriando>	T_T
05:38	<matkix0s>	Can someone remind me what the command is to install a c compiler?
05:39	<crouton>	tenki - can you run a memtest?
05:39	<crouton>	matkix0s: sudo apt-get install gcc ?
05:39	<nibsa1242_>	auridius try that, I suspect bad dl or bad disk
05:39	<Tenki>	If you tell me what that is.
05:39	<PriceChild>	matkix0s, sudo apt-get install build-essential
05:39	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: you're getting that during the install?
05:39	<crouton>	or that
05:39	<zelrikriando>	crouton ?
05:39	<zbrown>	Tenki: that makes no sense, thats a .exe file...
05:39	<Tenki>	Yea, when I run the CD that pops up.
05:39	<bliz0r>	How to access folders with space in the name, with terminal?
05:39	<matkix0s>	Thanks Guys!
05:39	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: i'd recommend the alternate install CD>
05:39	<auridius>	nibsal242: Yeah, i just did that, now it hangs at 46%, i think i'm gone burn a new ISO
05:39	<Afief>	goose: if you have as much free space left as you have data in your home partition you can still do it
05:40	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: Where would I get that?
05:40	<paulo>	hey guys, i have two sound cards, creative live and nvidia (on board). How do i set manually creative as primary card on alsa? im using gnome, when i try to do it iinside the grafical interface it wont work, i see creative as primary card but nvidia still are =/
05:40	<Kube>	btw, if anyone else was trying to figure out how to get swiftfox as default browser I have a pretty easy way of doing it now ;)
05:40	<nibsa1242_>	auridius before you try that did you do an md5sum on your dl
05:40	<paulo>	btw im using feisty
05:40	<Frog29>	hmmm since the ubuntu servers are now lagged due to feisty is there any way to get packages faster than 23 kb/s for ubuntu?
05:40	<Kube>	and thanks for your help
05:40	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: same place you got the regular live CD...
05:40	<francois>	hi, wine says i have a GLX extension missing for my display, but i have it in my xorg under modules, any ideas for the error ?
05:40	<bliz0r>	How to access folders with space in the name, with terminal?
05:40	<IndyGunFreak>	!alternate | Tenki
05:40	<ubotu>	Tenki: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
05:40	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: I downloaded the .iso file.
05:40	<auridius>	nibsal242_: How do i check that?
05:40	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: i know.. you need to download the alternate install iso file.
05:40	<nibsa1242_>	paulo, the easiest way I know of do that is to use jumpers or the BIOS to disable one
05:40	<xtknight>	bliz0r, `cd folder\ with\ space`, or `cd fold[tabcomplete] `, or `cd "folder with space"`
05:40	<Tenki>	Og ok.
05:41	<Cosmo_>	yay another issue fixed, my sound wasn't working because I just figured out the digital output was enabled
05:41	<nibsa1242_>	!md5sum >	auridius
05:41	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: the alternate install CD, is a text based install(don't let it scare you, its still easy)
05:41	<paulo>	nibsa1242: i cant, i need both
05:41	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: Ok, cool. I'll look around for that.
05:41	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: it should be on the same page you downloaded the live cd.
05:41	<Tenki>	Ok.
05:41	<IndyGunFreak>	if you can't find it, let me know.
05:41	<matkix0s>	One other question, I have an Ipod, where can I install the codecs so Rbox can play and update my music from the ipod format?
05:41	<nibsa1242_>	auridius hope that link helps, it hadn't been updated yesterday I don't know it it is today with the Fiesty md5sums
05:41	<Stinge1>	I tried to install a SLAX distribution on top of my Ubuntu one, and it didn't bother to partition, so I was left with Lilo in the MBR. I re-installed Grub using a guide I found on Ubuntu forums, and it now boots into Grub and tries to boot into Ubuntu, but gets hung up shortly after the splash screen. Can anyone help?
05:41	<simonn>	paulo - see http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=2459417&postcount=2
05:41	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: one more thing.. are you using the i386 version
05:41	<xtknight>	isnt ipod mp4 with a special magic/header?
05:42	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: I'm using the Intel version.
05:42	<countjocular>	I just tried to upgrade my edgy installation to feisty. It now hangs on boot up (see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16831/). Anybody know what's going on? I'm out of my bug-fixing depth here.
05:42	<zelrikriando>	can somebody tell me how to use echo options [module-name]  [module-options]  | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/[module-name]  ?
05:42	<frank_b>	my screen display has some sort of ghost lines on the right of the windows. does anyone know the right word for this for me to look for more information about it?
05:42	<nibsa1242_>	Stingel turn off splash you you can see what heppens
05:42	<matkix0s>	something like that, but where can I get the codecs?
05:42	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: not 64bit, right?..
05:42	<paulo>	so?
05:42	<simonn>	Stinge1 - I tried IMing you on this
05:42	<IndyGunFreak>	should say i386 in the filename
05:42	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak:  64bit AMD and Intel computers
05:42	<Tenki>	That one.
05:42	<auridius>	nibsal242_: Okay, thanks for the help. ;-)
05:42	<CarlFK>	sudo modprobe 3c509 brings up my ol 3com isa nic - where should I put that so it happens on boot?
05:42	<nibsa1242_>	auridius np
05:42	<Stinge1>	simonn - I have a PM window open right now, you haven't responded
05:43	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: ok..  just a word of advice.
05:43	<xtknight>	CarlFK, '3c509' in /etc/modules
05:43	<CarlFK>	xtknight: thanks
05:43	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: you might end up having an easier time with the 32bit install....
05:43	<Stinge1>	simonn - find my nick in the list on the right, and double-click it
05:43	<kalifornia909>	anyone install ubuntu to a raid array here
05:43	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: 64bit distros, require some tinkering to get simple things like web browsers, flash, etc, to work.
05:43	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: I'm downloading that right now.
05:43	<KevinSJ>	I have just done like they say on help.ubuntu.com but i still get this msg when i try to launch "mysql -u root" Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
05:43	<Tenki>	It's going really slow though : |
05:43	<simonn>	Stinge1 - have just IMed you(?).
05:43	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: which one are you downloading?
05:43	<jonah>	does anyone know what's going on with gdesklets on amd64 these days? it won't even start with feisty
05:44	<Stinge1>	simonn - it doesn't appear so
05:44	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: Standard personal computer (x86 architecture, PentiumTM, CeleronTM, AthlonTM, SempronTM
05:44	<nibsa1242_>	simonn I believe that PMs only work for registered users
05:44	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: ok..
05:44	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : rebooted - I'm getting MUCH further now...
05:44	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: and thats the alternate install, right?
05:44	<zelrikriando>	can somebody tell me how to use echo options [module-name]  [module-options]  | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/[module-name]  ?
05:44	<simonn>	How does one become registered?
05:44	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: No.

05:45	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : did you completely sort yours out ?
05:45	<IndyGunFreak>	Tenki: ok.. well if you don't mind trying the 32bit live version first, thats fine, but if that doesn't work, you'll probably need to go with the alternate install version.

05:46	<IndyGunFreak>	man, servers are getting pounded, you might be better served by getting it via bittorrent
05:46	<demo_>	PriceChild: what can i do with the 'The Composite extension is not available' error on desktop effects with ATI radeon 9550? (flgrx installed only)
05:46	<hak5fan>	Is the text based installer for ubuntu available on the standard live cd
05:46	<PriceChild>	demo_, you need xgl
05:46	<Tenki>	IndyGunFreak: Ok, thanks!
05:46	<demo_>	PriceChild: mind if i pm you?
05:46	<Stinge1>	simonn - does it work now?
05:46	<dauoalagio2>	hello i just tried installing feisty but came up with an error, so i rebooted and now my computer gets past grub and shows KUBUNTU in big letters with a progress bar but the progress bar doesn't move and after a little while it opens busybox or something.  some command line - don't remember the name.  any ideas?
05:46	<IndyGunFreak>	hak5fan: i don't think so.
05:46	<PriceChild>	demo_, stay in channel please :)
05:46	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : yeah mine rebooted without warning too.. i wasnt even sure if i wanted to keep some of the config files or accept the upgraded ones. i just kept the firefox ones.. dont think the others were customised... anyway, after the reboot (which I wasnt warned about), i went through the same process, and finished it.
05:46	<Rictoo>	Where is my sources.list again? =p

05:47	<matkix0s>	*** Again.... I'm wondering if anyone here can recall the program you can use to allow you to get the kernal source files without downloading them all. I'm attempting to install vmware and there is some thing you can install to give vmware the source info. I can't recall the program, can any of you?
05:47	<blackest>	demo_ it works with radeon driver see ubuntu community docs

05:47	<nibsa1242_>	eztk I generally look at the diffs and keep the new files unless its smething I know I had to change by hand to make something work

05:48	<demo_>	PriceChild: what about aiglx? would it work with desktop effects?
05:48	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : i tried looking at diffs.. didnt mean anything to me at all.. heh
05:48	<hak5fan>	IndyGunFreak: I didn't think so either
05:48	<nibsa1242_>	eztk anyhow I keep getting a Segmentation fault and core dump when it generates locale en_BW.UTF-8
05:48	<IndyGunFreak>	hak5fan: i'm pretty sure you have to download the alternate install CD.. thats what I did for my PC..

05:48	<Krishn1>	Hi all. i'm new to Ubuntu, I was trying to install the feisty on to my system. but i'm not getting the desired resolution. so i'm not able to even install it. I'm not able to move it properly as well..
05:49	<PriceChild>	demo_, not with your fglrx driver
05:49	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : i was gonna suggest what he said.. maybe the CD is corrupt. i had problems like that before
05:49	<sorcerer>	 hey guys .. i have a question about quake 4 .. iam trying to see if there is an alternative way to install quake4 without the dvd coz i downloaded a 2.8 gig version of quake which i think really is the whole game and i wanna try to install it ..? is there a way ofmounting the file and runnig an installer ?
05:49	<nibsa1242_>	eztk I have to goto work now... I hope that fixed it for you It looks like I'm simply in reinstall land
05:49	<Dheeraj_k>	whats new in feisy?
05:49	<demo_>	PriceChild: ive been told xgl is outdated and laggy, is it true?
05:49	<PriceChild>	demo_, I think so, matter of opinion
05:49	<phixnay>	krishn1: it sounds like x is detecting your resolution wrong
05:49	<nibsa1242_>	auridius yeah burn it again if the md5sum is correct
05:49	<Agrajag>	sorcerer: I don't think anyone is going to help you with something you "downloaded"
05:49	<Razor44>	hey,i want to gain some hdd space by removing apt cache files.problem is that when i "sudo rm -f /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb" i get a message back: "unable to execute argument list too long".Any solutions?
05:49	<demo_>	PriceChild: so isnt there any way to work out aiglx?
05:49	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : fsck has hung on 5% for the /home partition... or at least its having a think about something :|
05:50	<bengl>	so, i just upgraded to feisty, it looks like it installed compiz, which appears to be working, but beryl is not, any ideas? (dell inspiron 6400)
05:50	<Stinge1>	Hey, I think I found the problem! My /boot/grub/menu.lst file is blank! what's supposed to be in there?
05:50	<PriceChild>	demo_, aiglx is _impossible_ on fglrx. ATI don't make very good linux drivers
05:50	<nibsa1242_>	eztk I'll try that after work... hopefully this stupid house sells today
05:50	<billy>	Can firewall scripts produced by Firestarter be used in my iptables rules?
05:50	<sorcerer>	Agrajag:  well ok .. ..  thnx

05:50	<banangroda>	Hi. My CDs won't mount in 7.04 32-bit (worked fine in 64-bit).
05:50	<sc0tch>	If I use apt-get to install some software, does aptitude stay in sync with what is installed, can i sync it manually if not?
05:50	<KevinSJ>	I have just done like they say on help.ubuntu.com but i still get this msg when i try to launch "mysql -u root" Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2
05:50	<GoDawgs>	IndyGunFreak: yeah... that's not so good for me... I went ahead and installed automatix2... but thanks for the recommendation! ;)
05:50	<Stinge1>	snaunton: i did not
05:50	<BrMiHi08>	hello
05:50	<funalien>	how can I create a pppoe adsl connection in the kubuntu?
05:51	<billy>	magnetron_, that doesn't answer my question.l
05:51	<nibsa1242_>	eztk should the cd even matter after a chroot anyway? am i not only using what is on my hd after the chroot?
05:51	<bengl>	it was working before i upgraded
05:51	<phixnay>	Krishn1: try pressing ctrl-alt-F1, and then doing sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. You can leave the default options for most things, but pay special attention to the monitor part, and choose the vesa driver
05:51	<PriceChild>	sc0tch, "should",  howeve rbest to just use one or the other
05:51	<Stinge1>	bengl: make sure you have beryl-manager installed as well
05:51	<demo_>	PriceChild: ive been told theres and alternative fglrx that works with aiglx, is it true?
05:51	<IndyGunFreak>	GoDawgs: ok, good luck

05:51	<GoDawgs>	IndyGunFreak: thanks :)
05:51	<BrMiHi08>	I am guessing I am not in the right chat for 7.04 am I?
05:51	<Stinge1>	bengl: as well as beryl-settings-manager
05:51	<LjL>	sc0tch: i don't think it will. however, now apt-get (the whole APT, actually) has the same feature of aptitude where you can auto-remove unused dependencies
05:51	<nibsa1242_>	eztk sorry in the US
05:51	<PriceChild>	demo_, the original drivers installed on your box would hav eworked. However uninstalling fglrx is NOT easy
05:51	<bengl>	yeah they're all installed
05:51	<LjL>	sc0tch: but i'm afraid the list is not synced with aptitude's
05:51	<phixnay>	BrMiHi08: this is the feisty chat
05:51	<fabbos>	I just upgraded to feisty -  and its broken, i can tboot to a normal console, how can i boot to a console where i can use apt-get
05:51	<vfl>	Razor44:  apt-get clean  or apt-get autoclean
05:51	<BrMiHi08>	thanks phixnay
05:51	<Tuple>	PriceChild ATI fglrx on Xgl working here
05:51	<eztk>	nibsa1242_ : property so much cheaper in the US. I'm jealous. as for the CD, you're probably right. perhaps it downloads from the internet? is it worth doing a memtest86+ ?
05:51	<sc0tch>	Thanks PriceChild / LjL
05:52	<magnetron_>	billy: the point is that the firestarter rules ARE iptables rules
05:52	<Stinge1>	bengl: tried removing compiz and then re-installing beryl?

05:52	<dinoerata>	my fiesty works absolutely so great, but i got a problem. I used SUSE 10 to backup a lot of info on DVDs now i cannot read them, HELP !!!

05:52	<Stinge1>	snaunton - did you register your new nick?
05:52	<eztk>	krishn1: only advise ill give you is do not upgrade from edgy to feisty. its buggy and broken and quite frankly not worth it. but hey, you said install and not upgrade :p
05:53	<demo_>	PriceChild: is there any way to do it then?
05:53	<nibsa1242_>	eztk its been a long night/day of trying to get my desktop box fixed... I'm quite annoyed at this upgrading process the one reason I moved from Fedora Core to Ubuntu was because I hated the way FC upgraded... I could do a memtest86+ I'm 95% sure it'll come out fine unless my computer decided to goto shit I've memtested these modules b4 and they were fine
05:53	<snaunton>	Stinge1 - I think so.
05:53	<KevinSJ>	I cant get my MySQL to work, i try this in terminal "mysql -u root" and get the error "ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)

05:53	<Stinge1>	snaunton, it worked!! come back!
05:54	<demo_>	PriceChild: i perfer something less laggy and not outdated, do you know any manual to install the "better" flgrx drivers?
05:54	<Shafto>	ozymandias, Because it has soo many mirrors located all over the place that are better than torrents
05:54	<KevinSJ>	Can someone please help me?

05:55	<esperegu>	how can I make sure that I get the right access permissions to certain entries in /dev at boot time???
05:55	<PriceChild>	demo_, Okay for the last time. fglrx WILL NOT work with aiglx, only xgl. the ati/radeon drivers work very well with aiglx.

05:56	<ozymandias>	ah, i found the .torrent file on the "this server is too busy to give you the file" page
05:56	<nibsa1242_>	eztk I think it mainly has to do with when my computer crashed during the upgrade, maybe something got hosed and can't be fixed lucky for me I didn't try to upgrade all my computers at the same time
05:56	<magnetron_>	!offtopic
05:56	<ubotu>	#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
05:56	<snaunton>	Stinge1 - no. I think I am registerd though.
05:56	<Krishn1>	phixnay: i couldn't see any.. sorry in case i have missed it..
05:56	<phixnay>	Krishn1: try pressing ctrl-alt-F1, and then doing sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. You can leave the default options for most things, but pay special attention to the monitor part, and choose the vesa driver
05:56	<PriceChild>	demo_, then be patient or search for a guide yourself
05:56	<countjocular>	I just tried to upgrade my edgy installation to feisty. It now hangs on boot up (see http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16831/). Anybody got any sugestions? I don't really know how to bugfix this if I can't even get to a prompt.
05:56	<Shafto>	fabbos, Id have to agree, mine broke too
05:56	<phixnay>	try that
05:56	<eztk>	fabbos: i dont have time to fix any mess.. thats why i left windows.. i want to USE my machine, not MAINTAIN or FIX it
05:56	<magnetron_>	!patience >	demo
05:56	<fabbos>	eztk, imo it is not ready to be used.
05:56	<eztk>	countjocular: we're all having the same issue.. well some of us anyway
05:56	<goose>	countjocular: apparently they changed a lot of stuff and it breaks a lot of machines :\
05:56	<eztk>	fabbos: its a rushed botched up hulk of a mess.. its junk
05:56	<phixnay>	phixnay: you might have to go on the internet and look up your monitor's specs

05:57	<t0mu>	snaunton, this is former stinge1, can you hear me?
05:57	<Derek_Russo>	does anyone know the X directory as it is by default?
05:57	<phixnay>	Krishn1:  you might have to go on the internet and look up your monitor's specs
05:57	<nibsa1242_>	eztk I hope your touble shooting goes better then mine, I'm off to work now and I'll run memtest while I'm there to see how these OCZ modules are holding up... if they fail at lest they are under lifetime warranty

05:58	<IndyGunFreak>	dinoerata: that could be an issue.
05:58	<Nigromante>	hello
05:58	<jinzo>	dinoerata, you'll probably need some reiserfs-tools .deb or something like that
05:58	<nibsa1242_>	eztk I'll be back probably in 3 and a half to four hours
05:58	<dinoerata>	jinzo, where would i find those tools and what am i looking to do

06:00	<jinzo>	dinoerata, ok
06:00	<LjL>	eztk: tried rebooting? how did you install the driver? are you on feisty?
06:00	<eternalswd>	I'm having problems with feisty and my ati x300 card.  Initially it didn't load, so I set the driver to vesa and it loaded up.  I then tried setting it back to radeon which is what I had it as for edgy and restarted X and it restarted fine.  In the middle of watching a video, X died and I had to hard reboot.  Now it won't load even with vesa as a driver.  I booted up using edgy's kernel, and it worked, though X dies after a time on it now,
06:00	<eternalswd>	though it loads fine on startup.  I'm at a loss.

06:01	<LjL>	jovans: but yeah, i suppose with SCSI hdparm doesn't work that well (and sda means SCSI, even though it's really just ATA after all)

06:08	<AlienX>	fabbos, yeah, it was from dapper to edgy too.
06:08	<SRed13>	Would anyone be able to offer me some advice on setting up my first server?
06:08	<Derek_Russo>	magnetron_: how do I do that?  I'm very new to linux
06:08	<Agiofws>	anyone want to check if i have set up ubuntu server right to bring up its net interface which it is not doing ?
06:08	<magnetron_>	xtknight: no
06:08	<xtknight>	billy, ah well i'm talking 20 gigs files like virtual machines. but xfs is still better for gigabyte files
06:08	<Vessquire>	ubuntuguide does not have anything on firewall
06:08	<LjL>	eztk: and that should be 2.6.20.5-15.20 - if it isn't, pastebin the entire output of that apt-cache policy command (have you used third party repositories for installing the nvidia drivers?)
06:08	<AlienX>	SRed13, just ask a specific question and someone may be able to help you
06:08	<Clampdown>	crouton: matkix0s
06:08	<esperegu>	how to set persistant rights to /dev/ entries????
06:08	<crouton>	matkix0s: what was the question?
06:08	<Lenn>	is the livecd persistence working in feisty?
06:08	<xtknight>	billy, type "sudo filefrag fileInQuestion" and see how many frags it's in.  my VM was in 1000 fragments on ext3 (AKA 'CRAP')
06:08	<SRed13>	Ok.  I have managed existing servers on a windows 2000 platform before, as part of a computer programing class
06:08	<fabbos>	AlienX, yep.  Very annoying, completley pathetic imo.
06:08	<canaman>	helo im a heavy user of linux and ubuntu. I tried to install 7.04, but on first boot the system hangup with an error or modprobe "/sbin/modprobe abnormal exit". Has someone the same problem?
06:08	<Frog29>	My mouse cursor is disspaearing - can anyone help me?
06:08	<magnetron_>	Derek_Russo: in proprietary drivers manager, disable flglrx
06:08	<eztk>	LjL: installed (none)  - ill install it thru apt-get then?
06:08	<billy>	xtknight, 1000 frags?  !
06:09	<Derek_Russo>	magnetron_: Ok, I have done that
06:09	<SRed13>	I have a old desktop, I'm not using it, I would like to make a linux based file server and access it from my mostly windows PC's
06:09	<Derek_Russo>	magnetron_: well it was "ATI accelerated graphics driver" but I think it's the same
06:09	<xtknight>	billy, yeah and it froze the whole PC when i tried to start it.  i had no choice but to move it to XFS (which BTW has a defrag tool unlike ext3)
06:09	<Agiofws>	use ubuntu server
06:09	<eztk>	LjL : installing now
06:09	<SRed13>	Heres the thing.  Linux seems confusing to me, kind of backwards from what I'd expect
06:09	<kalifornia909>	would i have to use fiesty fawn server edition to install to r
06:09	<LjL>	eztk: uhm, no wait, give me the output (on pastebin) of  dpkg --get-selections | grep linux . want to understand why they aren't installed
06:09	<amicrawler>	what happedn to auto paste in fisty phon ?
06:09	<larson9999>	errr, i thought i heard someone say, "mostly windows"
06:09	<SRed13>	How would you go about mapping the drives on the windows pc?
06:09	<magnetron_>	Derek_Russo: it is. after restart, check the Desktop Effects preferences
06:09	<kalifornia909>	would i have to use fiesty fawn server edition to install to raid
06:09	<SRed13>	....sorry, that was me
06:09	<crouton>	SRed13: samba
06:09	<Derek_Russo>	magnetron_: ok, let me try
06:09	<billy>	xtknight, ext3 is still superior to ntfs or fat32, though, right?
06:09	<xtknight>	kalifornia909, feisty desktop alternate can use LVM/RAID, to my knowledge.
06:09	<Derek_Russo>	magnetron_: I'll be back in a minute
06:10	<xtknight>	!alternate
06:10	<ubotu>	The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
06:10	<SRed13>	So, is Samba a windows app?
06:10	<crouton>	no
06:10	<Daviey>	Anybody got the button on a brother network scanner to work?
06:10	<SRed13>	actually, googke
06:10	<crouton>	!samba
06:10	<ubotu>	samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
06:10	<BrMiHi08>	my ubuntu 7.04 is only downloading at .89 mb/s
06:10	<xtknight>	billy, ntfs and ext3 are superior to FAT32.  ext3 is in some cases, ntfs has unicode support while AFAIK ext3 does not
06:10	<SRed13>	Ok, dumbass question
06:10	<SRed13>	Sorry, I found the answer in two seconds
06:10	<crouton>	:)
06:10	<SRed13>	ok, I'm not a retard
06:10	<xtknight>	dont degrade yourself just ask

06:10	<kalifornia909>	is anyone else having grub problems
06:10	<xtknight>	i never understood why people swore at themselves
06:10	<SRed13>	I guess, is this actually not too hard?
06:10	<Nigromante>	NTFS write mode not stable
06:11	<crouton>	SRed13: if you're willing to spend some time learning, it's not hard.
06:11	<amicrawler>	auto past acation has gone missing
06:11	<SRed13>	I just want to plug this server pc into the router, and bam, have a new drive
06:11	<BrMiHi08>	magnetron_ - I should be using a torrent, but I am bot
06:11	<SRed13>	Well,I love DOS and linux just seems like DOS * 100, so yeah, I could learn.
06:11	<Frog29>	My mouse cursor is disspaearing - can anyone help me?
06:11	<crouton>	SRed13: it will take slightly more than 'bam' but you'll know more in the end.
06:11	<Whtiger>	how do I run something at shutdown?
06:11	<billy>	xtknight, self-effacement is a mild form of flattering others.
06:11	<SRed13>	With all the terminal commands.
06:11	<eztk>	LjL: ill need to SSH into the box, but it wont let me :|
06:11	<magnetron_>	BrMiHi08: what?
06:11	<ircusr>	frog, have you installed drives correctly?
06:11	<eztk>	LjL: to make it easier to pastebin
06:11	<SRed13>	Okay, I'll dl server edition.  Then I'll see what happens
06:12	<Clampdown>	Frog29: what type of mouse?
06:12	<Nigromante>	Frog29, check it is connected
06:12	<LjL>	eztk: ok, just tell me if there's anything "restricted" listed there
06:12	<xtknight>	billy, eh....i recommend ext3 or reiserFS/reiser4 for root, ext3 for /home, xfs for any files greater than a gig that are often-accessed
06:12	<crouton>	Whoever was asking about VMWare - I assume it was about Feisty: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=338305&page=2
06:12	<Frog29>	ircusr : yes..... it happens only in 7.04 and it seems like only when my screen gets blanked by power management
06:12	<ircusr>	disable power management
06:12	<xtknight>	billy, reiserFS and reiser4 are great at small files, though r4 isn't as stable as it could be.
06:12	<Frog29>	It is the cursor not mouse
06:12	<yoshx_away>	hello

06:13	<magnetron_>	fabbos: yes
06:13	<xtknight>	ahave, synaptic (gNOME) or Adept (KDE)
06:13	<billy>	xtknight, ok.  I'll have to remember that when stubuntu comes out.
06:13	<SRed13>	One last question, Samba seems insanely confusing.  Is it as bad as it seems?
06:13	<Nigromante>	try removing and reloading mouse kernel module
06:13	<xtknight>	billy, lol stubuntu?  whats that
06:13	<slackern>	fabbos, just choose to not format /home and give it the correct mountpoint when installing

06:13	<eztk>	LjL: unfortunately theres no audit trail.. its going to say installed because i hit the apt-get install before i saw your thing about not doing it.. sorry :(
06:13	<magnetron_>	SRed13: you can use System >	Admin >Shared folder for basic setup of Samba
06:13	<Nigromante>	Frog29, usb mouse?
06:14	<billy>	fabbos, just be sure to tell the installer to mount that partition on /home.  It won't, by default.
06:14	<xtknight>	billy, oh yeah?  well i have ubuntustudio pkgs installed already
06:14	<SRed13>	Wait.  So Samba installs on the LINUX pc.
06:14	<crouton>	yes.
06:14	<xtknight>	billy, on a regular ubuntu.  not sure the difference
06:14	<slackern>	fabbos, yes if you choose to do a format they will be gone
06:14	<RandomizeR>	i tried everything on the guide page, still no luck
06:14	<SRed13>	And makes it look like a NTFS to windows
06:14	<magnetron_>	SRed13: yes
06:14	<Clampdown>	Frog29: thats different... so your cursor vanishes, but you can still blindly use it?
06:14	<Frog29>	Nigromante - touchpad and usb..... i can move the mouse and everyonething i just can't see where it goes.... i also have cnrtl set up so i press it to see the location
06:14	<SRed13>	Ohhhhhhh
06:14	<crouton>	SRed13: it does not look like ntfs to windows
06:14	<xtknight>	billy, i use a lowlatency kernel though (actually selfcompiled with con kolivas interactivity patches).  great for everything
06:14	<kalifornia909>	anyone know why grub wont install to a raid array
06:14	<Frog29>	Clampdown yes
06:14	<twasbrillg>	if I burn a feisty .iso, can I upgrade using that without loosing all of my data?
06:14	<billy>	xtknight, beyond me, my homey.
06:14	<crouton>	SRed13: it looks like a 'windows share' to other windows machines.
06:14	<ivx>	hey does anyone know why when i use ispconfig to create an ftp user that user can log on but he can't upload anything, it says permission denied?
06:14	<PriceChild>	twasbrillg, the alternate cd, not desktop
06:15	<LjL>	eztk: well, if it's installed correctly, i'd just try rebooting
06:15	<SRed13>	Oh, well thats Easy!
06:15	<SRed13>	What about log ons?
06:15	<eztk>	LjL: ok
06:15	<Nigromante>	Frog29, can you see your mouse in console mode? do you have installed gpm?

06:15	<davidwinter>	hi all. I'd like to run Ubuntu for an arcade machine/pc thing. It's got an ArcadeVGA graphics card (based on ATI chipset...) just wondering what drivers I should us?
06:15	<davidwinter>	use*
06:15	<yeti>	is there a difference between the kernel packages that ubuntu and debian ship or can i use a debian kernel package with ubuntu?
06:15	<crouton>	SRed13: it can act like a NT4.0 PDC, if you're familiar with that.
06:15	<IceGuest_7>	kismet wont "make" anybody got any ideas for a newbie
06:15	<Nigromante>	Frog29, do CTRL+ALT+F1
06:15	<SRed13>	Ok, cool.
06:15	<xtknight>	yeti, you can not use debian kernels with ubuntu if you want your system to work reliably

06:16	<Derek__>	magnetron_: I'm in windows right now because all I get is text when I boot to linux.  I'm not sure how to fix that

For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

06:20	<Derek__>	xtknight: ok, sorry.  I just forgot because I am on windwows and it doesn't do the nice red outlining thing like in linux, heh
06:20	<xtknight>	dinoerata, yes absoutely
06:20	<xtknight>	Derek__, ohh
06:20	<Derek__>	xtknight: let me reset and try that, I'll let you know how it goes
06:20	<Daniel4711>	Anyone know how to get the update manager to do a Feisty Fawn upgrade from Edgy?
06:20	<dinoerata>	please tell me xtknight
06:20	<alienseer23>	after upgrading to feisty, I cannot get flash to work in firefox...help please??
06:20	<xtknight>	dinoerata, you should be able to flawlessly mount the dvd with no errors.
06:21	<xtknight>	dinoerata, just stick it in?
06:21	<jrib>	alienseer23: is flashplugin-nonfree installed?
06:21	<xtknight>	Derek__, um well hold on
06:21	<xtknight>	Derek__, why not just use vesa then go into restricted drivers manager?
06:21	<Wymark>	Ok, I'm on an XP and while this isn't a very ubuntu-oriented question, I still need to know it to set up ubuntu. How do I find out what driver my computer uses?
06:21	<magnetron_>	Daniel4711: no, but the servers is hammered by eager users
06:21	<xtknight>	blah!
06:21	<Nigromante>	Frog29, do you have configured a special graphics card for X ?
06:21	<billy>	Daniel4711, read this link from ubotu.
06:21	<Kim^J>	X and Firefox got HUGE HUGE HUGE memleaks!
06:21	<billy>	!upgrade >	Daniel4711
06:21	<dinoerata>	i did, but it does not even mount , while other dvds with movies songs mount just fine
06:21	<xtknight>	Kim^J, memory leak!=memory usage ;)
06:21	<alienseer23>	jrib: I am not certain, it worked fine before the upgragew
06:21	<Frog29>	Nigromante : sorta - i have the open source nvidia drivers
06:21	<Luser>	X doesn't have memleaks !!
06:21	<shawn34>	Wymark, just run the live-cd, it will auto install the right drivers
06:22	<fabbos>	how do iregister my nick
06:22	<jrib>	alienseer23: apt-cache policy flashplugin-nonfree   should tell you

06:22	<dinoerata>	but the dvd i backed up in SUSE before i installed ubuntu, these are the data dvds that will not mount
06:22	<d0lph1nK1ng>	xtknight, thanks the gaim-dev libs did it
06:22	<Daniel4711>	billy- That link contains no working instructions.
06:22	<Kim^J>	xtknight: Where are talking memleaks here... Plx, X cannot use 878 virt, 538 res 49-55% CPU. Constantly
06:22	<xtknight>	if flash 9 in the repos yet??
06:22	<billy>	Daniel4711, one moment.
06:22	<jrib>	xtknight: yes

06:22	<billy>	!upgrade >	billy
06:22	<Wymark>	I'm having a problem, and I have already discussed it with someone, and to fix this I need to know what driver I'm using
06:22	<Nigromante>	check you can move your mouse in console once gpm is installed
06:22	<Kim^J>	xtknight: Ehhh...
06:22	<Daniel4711>	Neither does http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
06:22	<xtknight>	Kim^J, sounds like another problem if it's using CPU?
06:22	<Luser>	hello
06:22	<Kim^J>	On Fedora, My X didn't went over 100MB at anytime.
06:23	<Luser>	ubuntu ubuntu they drink it in the congo ?

06:23	<alienseer23>	I suppose I need more coffee
06:23	<aleksanteri>	thx ubotu :)

06:23	<magnetron_>	!ask >	amicrawler
06:23	<shawn34>	when im running an upgrade, the terminal output has allot of tar errors, like: 'tar:/ timestamp blabla s in the future... whats that mean?
06:23	<antidrugue>	frog29: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors
06:24	<xtknight>	Kim^J, why is X using so much cpu?
06:24	<IDE1234>	I cant install Fiesty Fawn on VirtualBox ,anyone tried that?
06:24	<Nigromante>	I use UK (in Spain I am)
06:24	<xtknight>	Kim^J, just sitting at the desktop even?
06:24	<Shaffox>	IDE1234, should work
06:24	<Daniel4711>	I guess I'll wait then.
06:24	<alienseer23>	again, thank you for the help and attention
06:24	<dinoerata>	xtknight , i will just pretend i did not hear that, "just stick it in"
06:24	<warriorforgod>	I am trying to boot up Feisty, and when I try and boot I get "Error reading boot CD.  Disk error 80, AX =4200, drive 9F.  I have the same error with 2 different cd's. Any suggestions?
06:24	<Frog29>	antidrugue - i'm just getting programs... not ubuntu :)
06:24	<xtknight>	dinoerata, lol

06:24	<ch40s>	hey guys
06:24	<xukun_>	how can I install java runtime enviroment?
06:24	<Nigromante>	it is just for checking
06:24	<antidrugue>	Frog29: most of those should work with apt-get/synaptic
06:24	<xtknight>	dinoerata, lol, :P and she (ubuntu) didnt like it?
06:25	<Kim^J>	xukun_: sudo apt-get install java ?
06:25	<Daniel4711>	<magnetron_>	Might be good to update the upgrade instructions to say that, avoid some confusion. I.e. "If the Upgrade button does not appear, the servers may be overloaded, try again later".
06:25	<ivx>	how do you do a chmod to a dir from terminal? coudl someone give me an example
06:25	<idefixx>	I start linux out of the ntldr (stage1 in a file etc.) after updating to feisty when i start select the linux entry it loads stage 1.5 (reiserfs) then gets to stage 2 and just reboots ???

06:28	<ch40s>	any body have any ideas?
06:28	<Frog29>	are all repositories updated? or would some be out of date?
06:28	<shawn34>	restart gdm
06:28	<antidrugue>	Frog29: all should work fine
06:28	<xtknight>	Frog29, sudo apt-get update
06:28	<xtknight>	to make sure
06:28	<ceil420>	wot's that mean "fake root environment"? would that let me edit / files?
06:28	<Frog29>	k
06:28	<fabbos>	ch40s, thats how its mean to be, go ctrl-alt-f7

06:29	<xtknight>	ceil420, i'd like to know exactly also but i dont think it lets you edit root files.  one thing it does let you do is compile debian pkgs

06:29	<PetePhilly>	I've plugged in a USB gps device here to my 7.04. It uses a usb to serial converter. Lsusb shows that converter. How can I find out if the device is actually working and to what /dev/ it's connected?
06:29	<xtknight>	Frog29, oh
06:29	<Frog29>	antidrugue - so is it a bad idea to use the GUI best server selecter?
06:29	<xtknight>	Frog29, not sure
06:29	<Frog29>	k
06:29	<rabid>	i am missing /etc/apache2/apache2.conf anyway to regenerate the default conf file?
06:29	<xtknight>	Frog29, very likely that they are all RSYNC'd

06:29	<xtknight>	Frog29, but rsync update lag can be 10 hours or longer sometimes
06:29	<shawn34>	PetePhilly, it will show in the logs when you plug it in

06:31	<antidrugue>	Frog29: something like whois.ws should tell you
06:32	<shawn34>	PetePhilly, check in Admin and Prefs, its in one of those menus
06:32	<Clampdown>	but that was for the update manger itsself :p
06:32	<xtknight>	Frog29, antidrugue type "whois ip" in the terminal
06:32	<idefixx>	I boot linux out of the ntldr (stage1 in a file etc.) after updating to feisty when I select the linux entry it loads stage 1.5 (reiserfs) then gets to stage 2 and just reboots ??? the strangest thing is when I manually load the my menu.lst from a boot disk it works. Any ideas?
06:32	<antidrugue>	xtknight: oh, right
06:32	<Frog29>	xtknight but there are so many in america :)
06:32	<PetePhilly>	shawn34, it doesn't show any /dev/* !
06:32	<PetePhilly>	in that viewer
06:32	<xtknight>	Frog29, eh where is this mirror list?
06:32	<PetePhilly>	any other way to determine where a /dev/ got connected?
06:32	<shawn34>	PetePhilly, there are multiple logs to view in the logviewer you need to find the right one,
06:32	<xtknight>	PetePhilly, what exactly do you mean?
06:32	<antidrugue>	xtknight: wow, i didn't knew that, thanks

06:34	<sethp>	xtknight: It didn't work for me before, though (when I installed Xubuntu). I tried doing root(hd1,0) / makeactive / chainloader +1 and GRUB told me it didn't know how to boot like that
06:34	<PetePhilly>	Xteven, shawn34 dmesg only says "new full speed usb device using pxa27xx-ohci and address 2"
06:34	<wiglaf>	thanks billy
06:34	<xtknight>	Frog29, all the mirrors are chained together and update each other as soon as bandwidth is available
06:34	<billy>	wiglaf, ur welcome. :)
06:34	<magnetron_>	!easysources >	wiglaf
06:34	<Frog29>	k
06:34	<xtknight>	sethp, install grub to the mbr not the boot loader
06:34	<xtknight>	sethp, e.g. (hd0)
06:34	<PetePhilly>	Xteven, shawn34 ...after I plugin the usb gps receiver using usb to serial cable
06:35	<Bnirkow>	i`m trying to run vncserver and when i`m connecting i see error "vncviewer: ConnectToTcpAddr: connect: Connection refused; Unable to connect to VNC server"
06:35	<wiglaf>	thanks guys......later!
06:35	<proog>	anyone know about philips spc200nc webcam?
06:35	<huangdi1688>	hello, anyone knows how to get around the "cannot access tty" issue with the LiveCD?
06:35	<theband1968>	thanks wiglaf
06:35	<xtknight>	sethp, you actually dont need any code at all on any specific partition if you have grub on the mbr.  one instance of grub can mount many ext3 linux roots and read the kernel from them
06:35	<idefixx>	zonum: I already reinstalled it to the bootsector of hda1 if that is what you mean.. witch is pretty pointless because stage 1,5 is anyway written after that in a reiserfs.
06:35	<PetePhilly>	proog, sounds like you are looking for the spcxx cam driver. see the wiki...
06:35	<billy>	bye folks!
06:35	<RandomizeR>	guys, i have a nvidia FX 5200 that's giving me hell trying to use with acceleration on either edgy or feisty.. is there any possible fix under the sun or should i just give up and exchange it for an ATI?
06:36	<linoleum>	do you know guys, why nvidia-settings is not shown in the application menu? I have to launch it with the cli
06:36	<PetePhilly>	Xteven, can you get anything from that dmesg output I copied?
06:36	<rabid>	anyone know how to regenerate the default /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
06:36	<proog>	PetePhilly, ok ill look there
06:36	<KevinSJ>	How to register nick
06:36	<RandomizeR>	cuz i really like that card, it's got twice the amount of memory as the other ATI card i have lying around
06:36	<compengi>	hi gnomefreak
06:36	<xtknight>	rabid, like restore default?
06:36	<ceil420>	!register | KevinS1
06:36	<ubotu>	KevinS1: Information about registering your Freenode nick is at http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
06:36	<KevinSJ>	i have done it but how to log i
06:36	<idefixx>	zonum: and it gets to stage 2 in any case so it has loaded the 1,5 reiser and is allready on the right partition
06:36	<ceil420>	:o
06:36	<fabbos>	What's the forum to post upgrade errors?
06:36	<xtknight>	rabid, there might be a default or backup file in /etc/apache2.  not sure.  you could consider reinstalling the package but you may risk losing other stuff
06:36	<compengi>	gnomefreak, have you made a new source list for feisty?
06:36	<KevinSJ>	Whats the command for log in with my nick
06:36	<rabid>	xtknight: i just need the one that was there right after my apt-get install of apache2
06:36	<Shafto>	KevinSJ, /msg NickServ IDENTIFY <password>
06:36	<ceil420>	KevinS1,  /ns help identify
06:37	<ceil420>	or that
06:37	<zonum>	idefixx: I had the same issue - I would see "... Stage 2.."  then reboot...
06:37	<Gunrun>	How on earth do I use my second monitor :(
06:37	<HYPOCRISY>	I'll find out
06:37	<rabid>	xtknight: i must not have the right package for that specific conf file as reinstalling apache2 package doesnt do it
06:37	<sethp>	xtknight: ok, I'll try that, thanks
06:37	<bootbat>	mplayer does not work in feisty
06:37	<xtknight>	rabid, eh did you purge the pkg
06:37	<ceil420>	cool, /id <pass>	works too
06:37	<bootbat>	any thoughts?
06:37	<idefixx>	zonum: well allright ill install it manually
06:37	<xtknight>	rabid, sudo dpkg --purge apache2pkg && sudo apt-get install apache2pkg
06:37	<idefixx>	zonum: thx for the tip
06:37	<xtknight>	rabid, completely remove, or purge in dpkg speak, removes config files.  remove, or -r does not
06:37	<rabid>	xtknight: didnt have the dpkg command
06:37	<shawn34>	how do i perform a distro upgrade from the command line?
06:37	<xtknight>	rabid, 'completely remove' in synaptic
06:38	<xtknight>	!upgrade | shawn34
06:38	<ubotu>	shawn34: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
06:38	<bootbat>	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
06:38	<xtknight>	update sources.list and dist-upgrade
06:38	<zonum>	idefixx: Yes, I booted from a Live CD and did this work "manually"...  What was key was using "setup (hd1,0)" NOT "setup (hd1)
06:38	<warriorforgod>	I am trying to boot up Feisty, and when I try and boot I get "Error reading boot CD.  Disk error 80, AX =4200, drive 9F.  I have the same error with 2 different cd's. Any suggestions?
06:38	<morrolan>	Hi all - how do I "turn off" my root account after accidentally enabling it?  I prefer just to use sudo and not have a root account per se
06:38	<bootbat>	Did you check the CD for errors?
06:38	<kalifornia909>	anyone sucessfully install ubuntu to a raid array please let me know
06:38	<ephemeralDream>	hello, today after i upgrade to 7.04, everytime i use Ctrl+ALt+BackSpace to restart X, it brings me to terminal not the login screen
06:38	<Clampdown>	bootbat: A few people have complained about this. I reckon totem-xine is good... as you can use the W32Codecs, like mplayer? If thats any help?
06:38	<KevinS2>	hh
=== KevinS2 is now known as kevinS2
06:39	<kevinS2>	n
06:39	<ceil420>	weird :o
06:39	<zonum>	idefixx: One other thing I did prior to fixing it manually, was to mount the drive, then did a "chroot <mount location>", then I ran grub and did what I just told you about root/setup,...
06:39	<kevinS2>	How do i change nick?
06:39	<ceil420>	it always brings me to login screen
06:39	<Shafto>	warriorforgod, You didnt burn by nero did you?
06:39	<ceil420>	kevinS2, /nick <newnick>
06:39	<rabid>	xtknight: trying it out, have to fight with dpkg a bit
06:39	<zonum>	idefixx: Once this was done, I was able to boot w/o issues...
06:39	<Gunrun>	type /nick and then what you want, KevinS2
06:39	<rabid>	i guess i just didnt know how to really do a purge
06:39	<zonum>	idefixx: Anyway, good luck...
06:39	<idefixx>	zonum: of course - tip use supergrub or make a boot disk that is able to walk trough partitions and chainload bootsectors saves a lot of time, not starting the damn cd everytime
06:39	<bootbat>	Clampdown: Thanks..Xine works fine, even VLC works properly without the desktop effects enabled.
06:40	<xtknight>	rabid, well now you know ;)
06:40	<kevinS2>	well iam registered with kevinS1
06:40	<rabid>	exactly
06:40	<zonum>	idefixx: Ok, thanks for that tip...
06:40	<Clampdown>	:)
06:40	<fabbos>	shawn34, Don't do a dist upgrade it will probably break.
06:40	<ceil420>	kevinS2, if you're KevinS1 and trying to use that nick, you'll have to kill that connection or wait until it pings out
06:40	<kevinS2>	but i cant change to it
06:40	<ceil420>	kevinS2, "KevinS1" is still connected
06:40	<shawn34>	fabbos, whys that?
06:40	<xtknight>	ceil420, KevinS2 just GHOST kevins1
06:40	<kevinS2>	How do i kill it?
06:40	<bootbat>	Fiesty Rocks for me
06:40	<linoleum>	does someone here has an nvidia 8800 and run compiz/beryl ? I can do it but it s slow and crappy
06:40	<xtknight>	kevinS2, /msg nickserv help ghost
06:41	<bootbat>	One of the best distros....Guessing why people still would buy Windows
06:41	<ceil420>	is "Ex-Chat" the default quit message in xchat-gnome or something?
06:41	<ceil420>	i see it a lot :o
06:41	<Shafto>	ceil420, I think so yeah
06:42	<ceil420>	:p
06:42	<fabbos>	shawn34, many people have had their system break, thats all
06:42	<KevinS2>	well he must lag out some time
06:42	<chemaja1>	ceil420, my default is "Leaving" for XChat 2.6.6 on FC6
06:42	<skrea>	hi, I've just installed feisty and whenever I want to apt-get something it just grabs it from the install cd. Is there a way of forcing it to use the online sources?
06:42	<ceil420>	KevinS2, he just did
=== KevinS2 is now known as kevinS1
06:42	<bootbat>	Fabbos, I recomend the official method
06:42	<morrolan>	Hi all - how do I "turn off" my root account after accidentally enabling it?  I prefer just to use sudo and not have a root account per se
06:42	<shawn34>	fabbos, well im not talking about feisty, old laptop still on dapper
06:42	<ceil420>	chemaja1, my default in xchat 2.8 is "Leaving", too
06:42	<chemaja1>	ceil420, what version of XChat does Help ->	About say for you?
06:43	<magnetron_>	!offtopic
06:43	<ubotu>	#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
06:43	<bootbat>	I did it this morning and it worked fine
06:43	<ceil420>	chemaja1, but xchat-gnome isn't xchat
06:43	<ScottSatkin>	skrea, what is the output of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"
06:43	<rodness>	hi all, i have what is hopefully a simple question...  new to ubuntu, just installed 7.04, lots of previous experience with suse and rh....  my question:  is there a control panel for apps?  e.g. suse had graphical configurations for postfix, bind, etc...  if it's here i can't find it.
06:43	<chemaja1>	no i'm not using that
06:43	<chemaja1>	xchat-gnome is balls
06:43	<ceil420>	lol
06:43	<ceil420>	i've never seen it
06:43	<ceil420>	i've no interest in it
06:43	<ceil420>	(partially because i'm running Xfce)
06:43	<kevinS1>	m
06:44	<ceil420>	:p
06:44	<chemaja1>	ceil420, it was a fork of xchat which reportedly died in the arse

06:44	<Hoxzer>	Ok, Guys ... how can I get my system back into business if game crashes. I have tried changing to virtual console. ctrl+alt+backspace
06:44	<Horscht>	!wifi
06:44	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
06:44	<ceil420>	kevinS1, that was fast :x did you set an email address?
06:44	<kevinS1>	yes ofcourse
06:45	<magnetron_>	chemajal: it is not support related
06:45	<lmosher>	I -just- updated to 7.04 from 6.10 and I was checking out the new chess game... when I go to 3D it says I need to install some python bindings, but doesn't say which packages... Which packages do I need? My 3D setup is OK, I have beryl running and such.

06:45	<chemaja1>	magnetron_, actually it spawned from an application-default-config support query
06:45	<burnin>	is there an explenation somewhere of the ubuntu mirror directory structure?
06:45	<skrea>	ScottSatkin: which bits in particular?
06:45	<kevinS1>	Yes i set an email adress
06:45	<ScottSatkin>	SKREA: what is the output of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list"?
06:45	<ceil420>	kevinS1, then your pass is probably recoverable, but i don't know the process. you may try asking in #freenode
06:45	<magnetron_>	chemajal: yes, and got offtopic
06:45	<joshjosh>	RobbieCrash, add blacklist bcm43xx to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist

06:48	<coopster>	i'm having a problem with getting X to work at all.  i just did an upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10 on this server that i am setting up, and now when I try to start X, xauth says creating new auth file, hangs for a while says 'giving up.', then xinit says connection refused and server error
06:48	<joshjosh>	Frog29, yes. just apt-get install it and it will download the KDE lib files you need
06:48	<rodness>	anyone?  is there an app configuration (postfix, bind, etc) utility in ubuntu somewhere that i don't know about?   (really hoping to avoid hand editing config files... i think my mac spoiled me.)
06:48	<ceil420>	Frog29, i'm 80% sure you can install the KDE libraries in GNOME and use KDE apps, yeah
06:48	<Frog29>	joshhoh ok
06:48	<kevinS1>	Does someone know how to recover a password

06:51	<ScottSatkin>	sky shark, what is your question?
06:51	<sky_shark>	i'm attempting to install java on feisty and
06:51	<sky_shark>	it says to su

06:51	<morrolan>	Hi, I've tried to install an icon theme by dragging it into the theme selector window and it has crashed GNOME nbecuase it doesn't known what theme to use! How can I edit the gconf editor from the CLI?
06:51	<sky_shark>	it never lets me type anything in on that line
06:52	<fabbos>	warriorforgod, well its possible that the image you dowloaded has an error, but its soounds like its either the CD or the drive.
06:52	<ScottSatkin>	the password is not printed as you type it, just press enter after typing it, and it should work
06:52	<vafada>	sky_shark, try sudo and just type in, yo wont see the input
06:52	<sky_shark>	so i can't enter my password so i can't continue with the java install even though I am the root user for Ubuntu
06:52	<kevinS1>	Does someone know how to recover a password from a registred nick on IRC, i have set an email
06:52	<sky_shark>	okay
06:52	<fabbos>	whats the best forum to post uprade errors in?
06:52	<vafada>	sky_shark, that's for security, i guess
06:52	<warriorforgod>	fabbos well, I will try a different drive.  I would lean towards download though i guess.
06:52	<coopster>	steharg79_, any section in particular, or are you suggesting I should read the whole thing?

06:53	<Clampdown>	:p
06:53	<compengi>	what do you prefer to update to feisty or to get a clean install?
06:53	<ceil420>	rttm, there's a #beryl where they may know more
06:53	<Clampdown>	apokk: theres 1370 is us who will try to help you :p
06:53	<ScottSatkin>	rttm: do you have the "desktop cube" turned on?
06:53	<rodness>	guys, hate to beg but would really appreciate an answer... is there a graphical configuration for network services (postfix, bind, ssh, dovecot) that i maybe haven't installed or don't know about?  something equivalent to the suse control panel maybe?
06:53	<fabbos>	warriorforgod, yeah, you could do a media check to make certain i suppose..but the error you posted looks like cd/drive ;)
06:53	<steharg79_>	coopster - depends what you need help with - almost everything is covered there though

06:53	<rttm>	will try that thanks ceil
06:54	<compengi>	Shafto, but is it risky to update?
06:54	<fabbos>	rodness, for some reason ubuntu didnt include it, change to RH or suse

07:10	<bluefox83>	cox377,  ok, this is an easy fix actually...first to make sure everthing is working correctly, we're gonna have the system detect your hardware setup and create a new xorg.conf
07:10	<cox377>	bluefox83: ok mate, cook
07:10	<ompaul>	to1, apt-cache search lib | less << might help and see what that
07:10	<bluefox83>	cox377, do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
07:11	<ceil420>	i'm not sure, but that looks more like portuguese  than spanish to me...
07:11	<darwin>	I recently switched to dvorak but the gnome login is still using the qwerty layout
07:11	<bluefox83>	cox377, it's all pretty simple from there, once that's done i want you to let me know

07:11	<ompaul>	to1, if you want to install the normal (a wide set of materials it is too) sudo apt-get install build-essential << that is useful
07:11	<Pinkfrog>	with the amd64 version on boot are the messages kernel alive then kernel direct mapping and a number anything to worry about?
07:11	<soundray>	darwin: you'd have to run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' to have dvorak in gdm, too.
07:11	<ScottSatkin>	bamzin: chmod a+rwx <folder name>
07:11	<bluefox83>	cox377, huh? process?
07:12	<ceil420>	yeah that
07:12	<jinzo>	bamzin, chmod it , to 777

07:15	<ompaul>	to1, in gnome menu - System ->	Administration ->	Synaptic Package Manager
07:15	<cox377>	bluefox83: could not open default font 'fixed' is the msg i get
07:15	<Frog29>	i like the new ubuntu... better wireless and easy nvidia driver installs!
07:15	<bluefox83>	people are asking some crazy questions in here today :o
07:15	<colbert>	hehe
07:15	<shane634>	new releases do that lol
07:16	<Kix>	:p
07:16	<Frog29>	:)
07:16	<antidrugue>	Frog29: yes, a very solid release indeed, pretty stable too
07:16	<bluefox83>	cox377, ah..ok lets just make this super easy... sudo apt-get install ubuntu desktop
07:16	<z>	hey all, for some reason metacity doesnt start with my session now, i always have to type metacity in the terminal to bring up everything
07:16	<Stig>	Yeah, I was really impressed that Feisty recognised my wireless card straight away...
07:16	<soundray>	kkerwin: you should install those packages with sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite
07:16	<Frog29>	let me add my crazy question - somehow at some point i think i told ubuntu not to isntall certain updates....... now i can't figure out how to install those up[dates
07:16	<bluefox83>	cox377, actually tht might be ubuntu-desktop
07:16	<vox754>	Stig, which one?
07:16	<kkerwin>	soundray: Thank you. Lemme give that a try.
07:17	<soundray>	kkerwin: hold on...
07:17	<Frog29>	antidrugue - i think it still need better pwoer managment for laptops..... i beleive i get better perfermanec of battery life in windows
07:17	<kkerwin>	soundray: K
07:17	<Stig>	I think it's a broadcom something... came with my Dell 9400. It worked as soon as I installed Feisty.
07:17	<antidrugue>	Frog29: if you go in update manager, you can install any update available
07:17	<fadumpt>	shane634: you wanted me to msg you?
07:17	<cox377>	bluefox83: yeh i'm gonna hgave a play about.. cheers anyway
07:17	<soundray>	kkerwin: only the kdelibs one. The powernowd thing is different.
07:17	<shane634>	fadumpt, yeah i have some car knowledge
07:17	<to1>	ah....   ompaul  thx man...  don#t know why i didn#t see that one :)
07:17	<antidrugue>	Frog29: i have better power management performance in Debian than in Ubuntu
07:17	<kkerwin>	Stig: Sounds like an issue for ndiswrapper
07:17	<fadumpt>	okay, I sent you a pm
07:17	<kkerwin>	!ndiswrapper | Stig
07:17	<ubotu>	Stig: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
07:18	<kkerwin>	soundray: K
07:18	<Frog29>	antidruge - i isntalled all available updates from the ubdate menu or whatever... but i saw one saying something about desktop backgrounds originalyl ythen when u ran it the second time it didn't have that bacground thing
07:18	<soundray>	kkerwin: cd to /var/cache/apt/archives and use the full name of the deb file.
07:18	<bluefox83>	cox377, installing the ubuntu-desktop package will install gnome and xorg, and if i'm not mistaken, will also configure it for you...that should make life easier
07:18	<antidrugue>	Frog29: a few hints there: http://technowizah.com/2007/01/debian-how-to-power-management.html
07:18	<Frog29>	antidrugue - thanks
07:18	<cox377>	bluefox83: cheers mate
07:18	<z>	hey all, for some reason metacity doesnt start with my session now, i always have to type metacity in the terminal to bring up everything
07:18	<antidrugue>	Frog29: plus make sure you don't have too much uneeded services running
07:18	<vox754>	kkerwin, he said the card works, hence no need for ndiswrapper
07:18	<shane634>	fadumpt, i didn't get it.. you have another messenger?
07:18	<TokenBad>	ok I am trying to install the nvidia drivers for the new ubuntu....is there a how to for this yet?
07:18	<Stig>	lol, I was gonna say
07:18	<Stig>	think he misread
07:19	<ch40s>	!nvidia
07:19	<kkerwin>	vox754, and Stig: Ya. Misread
07:19	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
07:19	<auridius>	Maybe a usefull tip ; a quick search on isohunt.com "ubuntu bible" gives a torrent link to the 2007 ubuntu bible...
07:19	<bluefox83>	cox377, i hope it works for you
07:19	<Frog29>	antidrugue - is there any way to tell esily what services i don't needd? (i'm still new to ubuntu :) )
07:19	<bluefox83>	wtf is the ubuntu bible?
07:20	<wastrel>	hi
07:20	<antidrugue>	Frog29: i think there is a service management utility in System->	Administration

07:20	<BlueEagle>	askar: beryl?
07:20	<ch40s>	I can't get the live cd to boot to a GUI, i tried reconfiguring the xserver, but no luck, still won't give me the GUI, any ideas?
07:20	<z>	why isnt metacitry starting with my session anymore since i updated to fiesty
07:20	<BlueEagle>	!beryl
07:20	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
07:20	<auridius>	bluefox83: It's a ebook, with everything covered in it, from desktop use to server
07:20	<z>	i can only see the windows and stuff after typing metacity in the console
07:20	<antidrugue>	Frog29: be prudent though
07:20	<cotton>	Hey, How can I make gaim load up channels automatically on startup?

07:21	<askar>	BlueEagle: nope..comes when Im starting a 3dgame
07:21	<auridius>	bluefox83: I just wanted to help, whatever your opignion is.
07:21	<z>	Anyone
07:21	<qebab>	I feel really silly right now, so please go easy but: http://img399.imageshack.us/img399/4521/skjermdumppl0.png this seems to have locked there. What do I do to progress?
07:21	<BlueEagle>	askar: I see. Which windowmanager, gfx card, driver et al. are you running?
07:21	<compengi>	bluefox83, ask in #pidgin
07:21	<z>	why does metacity start only when i type "metacity" in the terminal
07:21	<bluefox83>	auridius, well, it's the thought that counts i guess :)
07:22	<TokenBad>	do I follow those instructions for edgy or what?
07:22	<fadumpt>	actually I can't remember my yahoo, shane
07:22	<askar>	 BlueEagle:  im running metacity at the moment.. with an intelcard with i810 driver
07:22	<qebab>	I've tried the obvious things like 'y'+return, return, 'Ok'+return and so on
07:22	<sky_shark>	well i ran the whole sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre but firefox still acts like java isn't installed
07:22	<ScottSatkin>	qebab try typing <tab>	<enter>

07:23	<fadumpt>	actually I maybe online now :-/ I almost never use yahoo
07:23	<vox754>	qebab, I thought you were looking for a lawyer!
07:23	<BlueEagle>	askar: Yeah, according to google there appears to be a problem with intel cards and 2.6.odd kernels. Unfortunately I haven't got such a card so I can't be of much help to you. :(
07:23	<fadumpt>	try to msg me...
07:23	<sky_shark>	and then during the install i ogta warning /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 does not exist or is not a directory
07:23	<magnetron_>	qebab: select the ok button with arrow keys, then hit space
07:23	<ch40s>	I am having problems with x, i reconfigured it, and restarted the GDM (a couple times) and still no graphic when i ctrl+alt+f7
07:23	<TokenBad>	on the wiki page for installing the nvidia drivers should I follow for edgy or what...since I have the new ubuntu released just the other day
07:23	<sky_shark>	does that mean java wasn't installed properly?
07:23	<askar>	BlueEagle: :S ok. think it will be solved?
07:23	<adaptr>	hi all, I connect a usb camera and nothing happens; next I modprobe usbvision and it loads all the dependencies, but still no video device... what's the next step ?
07:23	<Shafto>	You guys should be proud, the CEO of Dell has Feisty on his laptop :D
07:23	<qebab>	vox754: the only lawyer I'd ever need is one to convince people that I'm smart enough to be permitted to live :)
07:23	<shane634>	fadumpt, i just sent a message
07:23	<vox754>	TokenBad, take a guess!
07:24	<z>	HOW come metacity doesnt load up anymore
07:24	<z>	whats wrong
07:24	<fadumpt>	not sure I got it
07:24	<EmxBA>	who might I contact related to mirror list at kubuntu.org? I've sent mail to mirrors@ubuntu.com one day ago and got no reply.

07:24	<seth>	how do I force grub to install to a specific hard drive (without physically unplugging my primary drive)
07:24	<shane634>	fadumpt, it is not showing you online
07:24	<TokenBad>	vox754, taking a guess can be bad...since it can mess stuff up...I was told to go to that page...but since its for edgy...and not for the new one...
07:24	<z>	metacity is enabled in the sessions settings but it never shows up when i start ubuntu, i always have to enable it through console
07:24	<auridius>	TokenBad: Follow the instructions on the nvidia site. Make sure to install the sources on your box.

07:25	<BlueEagle>	askar: I really don't know. I've never used intels graphics chips so I've got no experience with the graphics drivers. If they are supported by Intel try looking at their home page. There's even an odd chance that you'll be able to find info in some kernel forums.

07:27	<Stig>	magnetron_, thank you very much!
07:27	<BlueEagle>	kevins3: Feisty was released three days ago. The servers are probably overwhemled by people downloading. There ought to be torrents up by now and you will probably get better speeds off them. To play windows files with vlc you'll need the codecs for the files.

07:51	<depinko>	Anyony know what to do when I want upgrade Edgy to Feisty but I have no option to that step in Update manager, what do do then? It says that System is up to date
07:51	<Xsylotte>	magnetron_, i have downloaded iso img, and burned it to cd
07:51	<Frog29>	magnetron_ : are there any CD's that have a lot of commonly used extra programs?
07:51	<Xsylotte>	can i upgrade ?
07:51	<duelboot>	vox754, correct...jrib helped me the other day with the perl syntax, but I "upgraded" to Fiesty from scratch so I lost my history with Edgy
07:51	<syn_jet>	Liv, I havent enabled root login from gdm.. ok.. I shall try that.. thanks!
07:51	<imacpr0n>	I've used ntfs-3g in Puppy, which includes it by default. Worked good
07:51	<magnetron_>	Frog29: don't know
07:51	<imacpr0n>	Lets you write files in NTFS
07:51	<CheshireViking>	has anybody used Seveas's meta packages to install games & multimedia-gnome for Fiesty? I know they're designed for Edgy & it says they may or not work on different versions, so wondered if anybody had tried yet
07:51	<vox754>	duelboot, "jrib" is an op, so he is not always available
07:51	<GeekChick|>	imacpr0n, did you ever have corruption or badly written files or chkdsk complaints?
07:52	<henry_>	can someone take me through installing beryl... ive tried using the instructions on the website but it just doesnt work...

07:52	<seth>	I can't seem to get GRUB to install on my secondary hard drive. I typed the following from my live CD: sudo grub / root (hd1,0) [hd1 is the hard drive I'm trying to install grub on]  / setup(hd1). Upon reboot, I tried to boot with root (hd1) / makeactive / chainloader +1 and it tells me "Invalid device requested"

07:52	<oblib>	Anyone here use phpmyadmin? I just installed feisty, and I my browser wants to download a file rather than open phpmyadmin. All I've done is install packages, I haven't manually changed any config files
07:52	<zPacKRat>	Feisty will be LTS correct?
07:52	<Liv>	henry_: What happens when you try to install?
07:52	<imbecile>	!henry_ | xgl
07:52	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about henry_ - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
07:52	<imacpr0n>	Not that I noticed. Didn't do chkdsk much, if at all, but no sign of corruption. Didn't write much, though, mostly kept my writes to file systems mapped to single NTFS files, where no new blocks need to be allocated
07:52	<LjL>	zPacKRat: no. not LTS, and not "will", since it's released
07:52	<seth>	zPacKRat: no, Fiesty is not LTS
07:52	<Liv>	zpackratL Nope.
07:52	<assasukasse>	zPacKRat: no

07:53	<shane634>	psycop, search the forums.. a lot of people have that card working
07:54	<magnetron_>	Xsylotte: you can only do reinstalls with the "desktop" cd, for upgrading download the "alternate"
07:54	<jijutm>	but if you are so particular about the critical system, then dont play with it..
07:54	<seth>	zPacKRat: you're welcome
07:54	<soothsay>	ompaul: Hey, thanks
07:54	<depinko>	jijutm: last when I used this method I must completely reinstall Ubuntu, it crashed down
07:54	<psycop>	shane634: i tried, for several hours now, tried everything, just cant get it to work
07:54	<Frog29>	is there any program that automatically finds the fastest repository?
07:54	<oblib>	imbecile, Do manual mode, and select the partition you want to install it to. Right click on it and reconfigure (or something like that) and assign it a mount point of /
07:54	<Yoi>	what does (0,0) means when i select advanced option in the installation process of the grub? I would like to install it in the same partition the OS is installed, because i want to have 2 different ubuntu versions installed...thanks!

07:56	<imacpr0n>	Ge0Ks, grab the little grey bar near the right side of the screen and drag it to the left
07:56	<teethdood>	Ge0Ks, move your mouse over to the right hand side, resize the window
07:56	<jijutm>	depinko: I do admit.. that is a real pain in the user.. when you think of ubuntu.. ie; the default install does not suggest a separate partition for /home.. but if you were wise enough to do that.. a reinstallation would not be a night mare.. if you prepare it..
07:56	<deserteagle>	does anyone know how i can change the refresh rate of my screen?
07:56	<Ge0Ks>	teethdood I don't have it

08:01	<Hasrat_USA>	qebab I can give you one idea. after upgrading to the latest feisty fawn, i thought 'okay let's uninstall sun java 5 and replace it with sun-java 6 which was already in the repository'. so i did and after that went to terminal and typed java and it said java isn't installed. and then i downloaded sun's JRE web browser plugin and java applets worked. but still i didn't see anything when i typed java in terminal, which is why i just
08:01	<Hasrat_USA>	got fed up, impatient, uninstalled everything and went bac to sun java 1.5. i know i should have been patient and tried to set paths or something like that but i didn't. by the way if you're a frostwire fan then bad news. sun java 6 aint gonna work with it, but 5 will so be careful!

08:05	<slyfox>	deserteagle: ok, that worked. What is the file format that linux uses for txt files? the ending is not .txt   .. what is it ?

08:05	<vox754>	slyfox, Unix doesn't need extensions, name it whatever you want
08:05	<variant>	slyfox: there is no extension.. it can be anything
08:06	<magnetron_>	slyfox: it standard UTF-8 . the name of the file doesn't matter
08:06	<variant>	slyfox: unix decides what a file is by content, not extension
08:06	<Hasrat_USA>	qebab you're welcome. unless and until you would die for not using Java 6, (and im sure you won't) simply don't choose to upgrade. and the more you upgrade a particular software the more hogged your resources get.
08:06	<psycop>	deserteagle: it says "No precompiled kernel interface was found to match you kernel"
08:06	<deserteagle>	slyfox: linux does not need extensions, they are only there for reference's sake, linux loads the header from each file and determines which program is needed to open the file
08:06	<Alon_005>	I need someone to take me step by step on making my partitions. I really don't wanna screw anything up.
08:06	<slyfox>	vox754: variant: so how would I delete all the txt files in a folder if they have no extension ?

08:07	<Hausberg>	ompaul nope
08:07	<phog>	kane77, I'll try that (with dpkg-reconfigure right?), but isn't the NVIDIA config file independent of X.. or something?
08:07	<vox754>	variant, slyfox you can use also "file <filename>"  or "file *"

08:31	<jrib>	cow_2001: because new software is released
08:31	<deserteagle>	the refresh rate in xorg.conf?
08:31	<deserteagle>	how?
08:31	<velko>	Alon_005,  too little. you need to resize your big partition

08:32	<ch40s>	hey guys i'm having some troubles with the live cd
08:32	<cow_2001>	jrib, and sometimes stuff break
08:32	<velko>	Alon_005, do you backed up your data?
08:32	<jenda>	theCore: corrected myself
08:32	<ompaul>	acidfunk, why not look here, as these guys are the: http://www.adobe.com/downloads/   -- you can generate but not edit with OOo and you can read with evince but not OOo that is all
08:32	<gnomefreak>	acidfunk: open synaptic and search there are about 25+ packages you will have to look through
08:32	<ra21vi>	soothsay: actualy i think there is some server overload... cuz from other sites, i get around 15kbps
08:32	<theCore>	jenda, better :)
08:32	<Ichijin0>	can some wifi experts pm me?
08:32	<jenda>	theCore: Daylight saving time freaks me out.
08:32	<cow_2001>	jrib, he wants to know why i do this
08:32	<Alon_005>	velko:  I don't know how to do that.
08:32	<soothsay>	ra21vi: Forget it then. The procedure in http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading doesn't say that you need to update
08:32	<Alon_005>	velko: I'm computer illiterate...
08:32	<iankesterhaney>	hello, how can I edit files that are streams?

08:33	<jrib>	cow_2001: well that's not intended of course.  Why you do what?  upgrade?  To get new features that come with new programs.  You don't *have* to upgrade of course, you can keep using what worked for you before

08:33	<kalam2007>	i did
08:33	<ra21vi>	soothsay: ok,.. actaully i downloaded Feisty, uploaded around 800MB thru torrent,, but when it came to burn, the cdwriter is not working at all.. i did punch it some days ago.. then i downloaded the alternate CD for upgrade
08:33	<Alon_005>	velko:  Oh. Don't worry about that. I don't have anything important to lose.
08:33	<frolle>	Can i use gparted when i am using my hda1, which is my only partition. Do i have to use the live cd?
08:33	<Kraeloc>	i can't watch movies over smb in feisty either
08:33	<Impaque>	ra21vi: ;)
08:33	<acidfunk>	ompaul: gnomefreak: thanks so far, even if you knew that already. its a shame that adobe isnt offering a .deb tho
08:33	<jrib>	frolle: yes, that is best
08:33	<Kraeloc>	sarikan, we are in the same boat
08:34	<kalam2007>	sorry i really need this thing workin because i need to read tha news
08:34	<velko>	Alon_005, ok. did you booted the live cd?
08:34	<sarikan>	Kraeloc: seems like a common thing
08:34	<Huffalump>	jrib, thank you. I am now in the editor and found the permissions section for Nautilus.  "start with location bar" is already checked.  Is that the wrong item?  Because it does not work.
08:34	<cow_2001>	jrib, would ubuntu say when i should upgrade? when the current version goes out of support?
08:34	<Alon_005>	velko:  Yes. I'm using the live CD at the moment.
08:34	<frolle>	jrib, i am just very afraid of breaking my OS
08:34	<sarikan>	Kraeloc: but no solution from gogole search :(
08:34	<mindframe->	what does this version number mean for the fluxbox package? 0.9.15.1+1.0rc2-1
08:34	<cow_2001>	jrib: i mean, would my system say when this happens?
08:34	<val_>	in feisty i activated the nvdia driver and i can only get the equivalent of vga resolution
08:34	<velko>	Alon_005, do you know how to start the installation?
08:34	<ra21vi>	kalam2007: did you get the solution?
08:34	<Kraeloc>	sarikan: what video player are you using?
08:34	<kalam2007>	no sir
08:34	<Alon_005>	I'm already at the "Prepare partitions" Step
08:34	<JimTB>	Can somebody help me out with the fglrx drivers? I tried both methods mentioned in the unofficial wiki, with the first I don't have direct rendering(dri missing) and using the second the only thing I get is a black screen of death...
08:34	<sarikan>	Kraeloc: Totem and mplayer
08:35	<sarikan>	Kraeloc:both fail over the network
08:35	<jrib>	cow_2001: hmm, it will tell you when a new version is available, I'm not sure if it tells you when it stops being supported.  LTS releases are 3 years on the desktop and non-LTS are 18 months
08:35	<Alon_005>	velko:  I'm already at the "Prepare partitions"
08:35	<cow_2001>	jrib: it told me i should upgrade to the new 7.04
08:35	<jrib>	frolle: what are you trying to do?
08:35	<ScottSatkin>	kalam2007: "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get install ttf-indic-fonts"
08:35	<velko>	Alon_005, ok. you can identify the partition you want to resize?
08:35	<Kraeloc>	sarikan: if you stream with vlc on the server machine, it should work fine
08:35	<meisam>	can anybody help me over my problem? i have installed ibm db2 express c V9.1 but i can not run it, how can i run the application?
08:35	<LiquidFiend>	are servers down?
08:35	<TokenBad>	is beryl and all that supported with the new ubuntu?
08:35	<Kraeloc>	sarikan: but it's kind of an awkward solution
08:35	<ra21vi>	kalam2007: first thing, when you write something for a person, just start with his id/name, u can press tab for auto completion and then write the msg.. thuis way it highlights and the person get attention..
08:35	<cow_2001>	jrib: okay, thank you very much.
08:35	<Huffalump>	TokenBad, you can run Beryl if you want.  Ask in #ubuntu-effects
08:35	<sarikan>	Kraeloc:yep, it's just a windows machine with movies on it
08:35	<frolle>	jrib: i want to encrypt my hdd, but i need to spilt it before..
08:36	<sarikan>	Kraeloc:and I want to watch them over network
08:36	<sarikan>	Kraeloc:a normal requirement?
08:36	<Alon_005>	velko: Partition: /dev/hda1/  Filesystem: ntfs  Size: 37.30GB  Used: 24.02 GB Unused: 13.28 GB
08:36	<TokenBad>	Huffalump, beryl is the latest right?
08:36	<Kraeloc>	sarikan: i think there is a way to fully mount a network share as a drive
08:36	<cow_2001>	jrib: Sleak design, sturdy construction, atractive housing. All-in-all, a fine distro.

08:36	<velko>	Alon_005, good. can you figure out how to make it smaller?
08:36	<Huffalump>	TokenBad, I'm not sure if I understand your question.  You can run the latest Beryl.  Ask in #ubuntu-effects which is where they talk about these issues.
08:37	<niriven>	Anyone know why desktop effects stops working (the cube, anyway) unless i reset my gnome settings?
08:37	<Impaque>	is anyone using AMD64 version of ubuntu-server on core2duo and/or any Intel 64-bit machine without any glitches?

08:42	<Huffalump>	niriven, mine has been very stable (until the past couple days, to be honest, but that's not a 64 problem).  you'll have to have two instances of Fx, one 64 that comes by default... and then install a Firefox32 so you can have Flash/Java.  Other than that, no problem.
08:42	<jrib>	niriven: btw, please don't recommend that way
08:42	<velko>	Alon_005, yes
08:42	<xtknight>	anyone have any suggestions as to how to make my root partition on Feisty a reiser4?
08:42	<RasQulec>	oly: xrandr is what you need to research. I havnt looked into it more then the name of the app
08:42	<demo_>	Agrajag: i cant get it to "on"
08:42	<Alon_005>	velko:  24.02 GB
08:42	<Agrajag>	demo_: oh, use the "m" key to toggle it
08:42	<xtknight>	maybe put /boot on an ext2 but rest of / on reiser? or something?
08:42	<kalam2007>	ra21vi no
08:42	<imbecile>	why is everyone doing fresh fiesty installs? is there no way to upgrade?

08:42	<jrib>	!upgrade >	imbecile    (imbecile, see the private message from ubotu)

08:42	<niriven>	jrib: Why? how else are you going to upgrade in the console?
08:42	<RasQulec>	imbecile: you can if you run the update manager but its hard and sometimes messes up
08:42	<trager>	will I get booted for saying go to my website to try my pong clone?
08:42	<BitEater>	where can i get the logo with 800px*800px?
08:42	<velko>	Alon_005, how comes? your partition is 6GB but you used 24GB?
08:42	<Huffalump>	imbecile, "everyone" is doing things differently.  most upgrade from Edgy.  some have problems and reinstall from scratch.
08:42	<jrib>	!upgrade >	niriven    (niriven, see the private message from ubotu)
08:42	<ompaul>	rcohi, 1 would be enough
08:42	<kalam2007>	i need it on bengali it doesnt come in english either
08:43	<Agrajag>	demo_: it will take effect immediately, so you can listen to music and turn it on and see if it changes
08:43	<Alonea>	!upgrade
08:43	<Hug1>	jrib I am guessing thats console, is there any graphic way?

08:54	<aatdark>	echnaton: and which OS works with suspend ..
08:54	<xtknight>	Hausberg, gparted can resize most
08:54	<Hausberg>	ext2

08:54	<jrib>	kanpachi: when you dpkg-reconfigure, there should be a screen with a bunch of refresh rates to choose from.  Did you see that?
08:54	<SR71-Blackbird>	my download of feisty dvd is stuck at 50%..
08:54	<alexises>	can i have some help to creat a usplash
08:54	<kanpachi>	yes
08:54	<Hausberg>	gparted does not play ball somehow
08:54	<SR71-Blackbird>	from ubuntulinux.org
08:54	<echnaton>	aatdark: ms-w-xp
08:54	<kanpachi>	i know that command
08:54	<echnaton>	;)

08:54	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	I don't get it
08:54	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	it was working fine
08:54	<Lord_Maynoth_42>	in feisty
08:54	<aatdark>	echnaton: acpi is kind of proprietr. on my windows it is working too
08:54	<SR71-Blackbird>	cd download is rocking tho..
08:54	<hobbesmaster>	I'm trying to update to feisty from edgy - but update-manager doesn't show an option for "upgrade to latest distro" or whatever at the top
08:55	<xtknight>	Hausberg, hmm?
08:55	<SR71-Blackbird>	any error?
08:55	<Hausberg>	xtknight I have ext3 I could reduce and ext2 I'd like to increase but somehow gparted don't want to do it=
08:55	<xtknight>	Hausberg, do you have the ext2 tools?
08:55	<aatdark>	echnaton: its all because the device vendors lack drivers..
08:55	<alexises>	jrib i have see the documentation
08:55	<Hausberg>	xtknight like?
08:55	<xtknight>	Hausberg, the partition on which you want to perform operations can not be mounted.
08:55	<etuardu>	Agrajag: no, user group
08:55	<xtknight>	yell0w, sorry forgot about your question.
08:55	<Agrajag>	etuardu: a user needs to be in the admin group to use sudo.
08:55	<imbecile>	i think ubuntu is going to make linux more mainstream because of its ease of use
08:56	<xtknight>	yell0w, it's something in the adduser command.  "man adduser"
08:56	<xtknight>	for adding a user to a group
08:56	<AnAnt>	are Feisty DVDs available yet ?
08:56	<Agrajag>	etuardu: if you deleted the user "oem", how did you manage to log in as that user?
08:56	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: try it from textmode (init 1)
08:56	<xtknight>	yell0w,  i think, like "sudo adduser USERNAME GROUPNAME"
08:56	<jrib>	AnAnt: cdimages.ubuntu.com should have them
08:56	<alexises>	the documentation don't speak to creat
08:56	<alexises>	es
08:56	<Hausberg>	xtknight I can't unmount the partitions? sudo umount says they are "busy" WTF
08:56	<vox754>	Hausberg, I feel the QTParted included in the Knoppix CD works better, you could try it.
08:56	<xtknight>	Hausberg, eh well which partitions are they, your root / or /home/?
08:57	<sebrock>	ehm, 7.04 didnt install grub for me? is that the way it should be?
08:57	<jrib>	alexises: it does, I see some gcc commands
08:57	<sorcerer>	hey guys .. i installed .. quake 4 linux .. but why is my whole game in spanish ? how do i change it .. ? i know its not ubuntu .. but iam new to linux
08:57	<xtknight>	sebrock, it should install grub..
08:57	<sebrock>	it boots straight into Windows
08:57	<etuardu>	Agrajag: I deleted the user oem but anyway now I'm logged in as oem (I don't know how), when I type "sudo command" it don't accept my password
08:57	<sebrock>	xtknight, well I saw the installation detected windows
08:57	<Hausberg>	xtknight I have /boot as ext2 I'd like to increase it and / and /home as ext3 I could reduce them
08:57	<ra21vi>	sorcerer: try googling it and go to its site for the matter
08:57	<xtknight>	why am i getting urlopen() problems on the ubuntu torrents?  any ideas?
08:57	<LiquidFiend>	Can anyone tell me how to change my resolution?  I'm using 7.04 and AIGLX
08:57	<xtknight>	i've downloaded two already without issue
08:57	<sebrock>	xtknight, but it still boots into win :/
08:57	<Agrajag>	etuardu: if you run "groups" is admin in the list that is returned?
08:58	<Alonea>	Ok, the Wireless Assistant is no longer automatically connecting to the internet any more. It started after upgrade.
08:58	<xtknight>	sebrock, ah well it's some type of problem.  unexpected behavior, certainly
08:58	<aatdark>	echnaton: you can try the kernel mailling list
08:58	<etuardu>	Agrajag: : yes
08:58	<alexises>	jrib sorry
08:58	<xtknight>	Hausberg, i recommend using the gparted livecd, you wont have problems with mountd partitions that way
08:58	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i'm not really sure what that means...
08:58	<Agrajag>	etuardu: and sudo doesn't accept oem's password when oem runs sudo?
08:58	<alexises>	jrib i have see at the french documention the howto to install
08:58	<Kraeloc>	impaque: and i just finished doing it
08:58	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: are you in Gnome now? (or KDE)
08:58	<Kraeloc>	impaque: gnome
08:58	<sgtmattbaker>	can you use an md5 hash to verify any file?
08:58	<alexises>	jrib i ggo to see
08:58	<echnaton>	aatdark: hm. thought there are  already some hints for that
08:59	<LedHendrix>	sorry. got d/ced so - azureus from the terminal output http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16866
08:59	<sebrock>	xtknight, yeah I guess, gonna reinstall it using system rescue cd..., by the way, looks like it didnt detect my wifi either, 6.10 did...
08:59	<Hausberg>	xtknight you mean boot on livecd and then do the deed
08:59	<jrib>	alexises: actually the gcc stuff is for dapper only.  But if you read the edgy description, it does explain where to find the Makefile you need
08:59	<xtknight>	urlopen() fixed iteslf.  i just restarted the torrent
08:59	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: you must restart xorg hardware detection from pure textmode, without graphical environment, i believe..
08:59	<etuardu>	Agrajag: no, it don't
08:59	<kanpachi>	can anyone help please, i can only get a refresh rate of 50 hz, and i used to get 85 hz on this res in dapper, and yes i've done "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and no luck :(
08:59	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: to achieve that, you must go to runlevel 1
08:59	<xtknight>	Hausberg, gparted has its own livecd with only gparted on it.  or you could use an ubuntu livecd and run gparted yea that certianly works
08:59	<aatdark>	echnaton: for what some hints ?
08:59	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: telinit 1
08:59	<xtknight>	sebrock, ahh ok.  i cant guarantee it will reinstall properly either.  it's probably a boot order thing.
09:00	<xtknight>	sebrock, grub got installed it's just a matter of which MBR
09:00	<crow>	Hi all, is there anyone hier that menaged to setup Wirelles with WPA(PSK) and new ubuntu network menager?
09:00	<echnaton>	how to fix that problem. i thought its a xorg problem
09:00	<xtknight>	sebrock, if you have multiple HDs try setting default to the other HDs,  do that until it boots properly.  and just use the HD that works since grub will boot windows also
=== foolsZzz is now known as foolswed
09:00	<sebrock>	xtknight, well both win and ubuntu is on the same disc
09:00	<oo_seven>	i have a couple of questions conserning the configuration of the gnome window manager that ships with ubuntu. i hope thats rightt channl for this purpose
09:00	<Agrajag>	etuardu: you're probably going to have to boot a livecd and chek that your /etc/sudoers file and /etc/group file are correct
09:00	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ctrl+alt+F1, log in as user and do sudo telinit 1
09:00	<LiquidFiend>	Can anyone tell me how to change my resolution?  I'm using 7.04 and AIGLX
09:00	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, but i just finished doing the xorg reconfigure thing in a console window while gnome was running, allow me to restart and see if that worked first
09:00	<oo_seven>	1. can i modify the size of the desktop icons?
09:00	<xtknight>	oo_seven, right click on them and click stretch
09:00	<Shauny>	why do i get the error make: aclocal: Command not found
09:00	<Shauny>	 using kdevelop?
09:00	<Shauny>	after running whereis aclocal i got a response of /usr/share/aclocal so im assuming its installed?
09:00	<kanpachi>	can anyone help please, i can only get a refresh rate of 50 hz, and i used to get 85 hz on this res in dapper, and yes i've done "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and no luck :(
09:01	<aatdark>	echnaton: is there any output on screen after you exit supendmode ?
09:01	<sebrock>	xtknight, gonna check with sys cd, see whats in /boot/grub
09:01	<Agrajag>	oo_seven: right-click >	stretch icon
09:01	<xtknight>	Shauny, sudo apt-get instlal autoconf
09:01	<Shauny>	woops sorry about lines
09:01	<kanpachi>	?
09:01	<xtknight>	install*
09:01	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: i'm not sure that that will work, because of all the hardware probing
09:01	<randomwalker>	i just created this page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromLinux -- to install from an existing linux without external media
09:01	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: do it from pure textmode, without gnome running
09:01	<echnaton>	no  this system is running but the screen is off
09:01	<xtknight>	sebrock, well it's probably an MBR problem
09:01	<jrib>	Shauny: install automake
=== LedHendrix is now known as Skiguy
09:01	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, fine
09:01	<g35>	is there anyway to make GRUB look nicer, i mean in terms of a GUI?  So like can you assign images for the different menu options or somethign of the like?
09:01	<etuardu>	Agrajag: damn... ok thank you!
09:01	<verb3k>	Guys can I install ubuntu 7.4 Feisty Fawn in text mode ?
09:01	<forteshadow>	I am trying to install 7.04 and it gives me an Authiantac Error after it tries to get the Installer.
09:01	<xtknight>	!alternate | verb3k
09:01	<ubotu>	verb3k: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
09:02	<sebrock>	xtknight, maybe
09:02	<raboof>	what command is ran when I click 'system->quit->hibernate'? it seems to be broken and i'd like to debug it.
09:02	<xtknight>	is there anyway to stop the gnome hal mounter from mounting my NTFS partition perpetually while using gparted?  it's driving me batty.
09:02	<forteshadow>	>	I am trying to install 7.04 and it gives me an Authiantac Error after it tries to get the Installer.
09:02	<oo_seven>	ok, stretching the icons works fine, thought i can maybe set them all to one size as well as default size for new icons
09:02	<Impaque>	verb3k: alternate is the way to go. i used it because the default LiveCD didn't offer xfs fs
09:02	<verb3k>	xtknight: Thanks for the fast redirection :)
09:02	<xtknight>	oo_seven, maybe in gconf-editor or something
09:02	<xtknight>	;)
09:02	<z0man>	How come the screen refresh rate keeps changing back to it's default?
09:02	<oo_seven>	ok, ill have a look at this.
09:02	<jrib>	xtknight: erm yeah, that happened to me, I had to just keep unmounting for like 5 seconds straight to get gparted to not complain
09:02	<verb3k>	xtknight: T
09:02	<Zorlin>	Wait..
09:02	<Zorlin>	how'd i end up in here? :S
09:03	<Impaque>	Zorlin: o_O
09:03	<Zorlin>	Must have opened irc by accident. Hi guys.
09:03	<z0man>	heh
09:03	<Impaque>	Zorlin: lmao hi ;)
09:03	<xtknight>	jrib, well it actually shows me a GKSU dialog every time it tries to mount, my only hope is to cancel that
09:03	<Zorlin>	Anyone need help with anything?
09:03	<z0man>	yes
09:03	<z0man>	me
09:03	<z0man>	:P
09:03	<xtknight>	jrib, it's crazy.  it REALLY wants to mount that thing :P
09:03	<Zorlin>	Impaque: I'm here against my will! My computer forced me here! *looks around nervously*
09:03	<oo_seven>	2. as far as i remember, it was possible to activate, some macintosh like behaviour for the shortcuts in the top bar, so they popup when i move my mouse around. is this possible ?
09:03	<Zorlin>	Z0man, what do you need help with?
09:03	<verb3k>	Impaque: Thanks ...I will try that.....but is it the same as debian's text mode installation ? because I am familiar with that
09:03	<jrib>	xtknight: oh, I was on the live cd so I didn't even get that prompt
09:03	<z0man>	How come my screen rrerefresh rate defaults back 50hz even though i need it at 54
09:03	<xtknight>	verb3k, yes it's the exact same as deb's text style
09:04	<xtknight>	almost verbatim
09:04	<makkk>	hi all. i did an upgrade to Feisty. For some reason, I dont think My network manager looks quite like it should according to the screenshots i've seen. How can I get that list of networks with associated strengths, WPA, etc?
09:04	<echnaton>	bye
09:04	<alexises>	i have read the documentation and ia dont see the information to modify and compil the source code in the exemple
09:04	<Impaque>	verb3k: yup, and it's really straightforward ;)
09:04	<Zorlin>	Z0man, have you set up Xorg correctly?
09:04	<sgtmattbaker>	if I burn a file to a DVD can I make an md5 hash of it to verify it copied correctly?
09:04	<z0man>	Now all the refresh rates have disappeared on me now..  Only 50hz
09:04	<Zorlin>	If that refresh rate isnt enabled it wont allow it
09:04	<Zorlin>	Oh okay, Type this command:
09:04	<Zorlin>	sudo reconfigure xserver-xorg
09:04	<verb3k>	Thanks for you all :) I really appreciate it
09:04	<z0man>	thx
09:04	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, i hit ctrl-alt-f1, and repeated that process, then got back into gnome by hit ctrl-alt-f7... now what?
09:04	<seth>	is there a way I can force gparted to NOT automount drives when I'm running from the live cd?
09:04	<Impaque>	z0man: (from runlevel 1)
09:04	<Zorlin>	reconfigure your x server and then MAKE SURE with the monitor set up
09:05	<blind_>	I have automake1.4 and automake1.9, and 1.4 is the default. will just removing 1.4 make 1.9 the default or no?
09:05	<Zorlin>	that you select the correct refresh rates
09:05	<Zorlin>	otherwise they wont be enabled.
09:05	<raboof>	does ubuntu use suspend2 or swsusp?
09:05	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: did you go to runlevel 1 beforehand? if you did, you couldn't go back to alt+f7
09:05	<predaeus>	ah it depends on the xmms-dev package in Xubuntu. now it works .... wheeee :-)
09:05	<Zorlin>	Wow, 1380 users? There was 1500 here at the launch. I was expecting it to quiet down.
09:05	<aatdark>	<sgtmattbaker>	should work
09:05	<meisam_>	makkk sorry friend i need to upgrade to feisty i went through the onlint tutorial but the uodate manager did not bring any upgade button, waht should ido ?
09:05	<z0man>	runlevel 1 meanning "type "init 1"?
09:05	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ... bugger
09:05	<Kraeloc>	impaque: no
09:05	<Zorlin>	z0man, you need to use sudo.
09:05	<Zorlin>	i think thats what he means
09:05	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: whole process, again: sudo telinit 1; sudo dpkg reconfigure.. .. . ; sudo telinit 2
09:05	<glaeven>	can someone tell me if a wireless card works?
09:05	<z0man>	oh ok
09:06	<makkk>	meisam, i did it by downloading the 'alternate' cd, then upgrading from there.
09:06	<sgtmattbaker>	aatdark: is there a minimum size for a md5 hash to be effective?? I hear that crc is better for smaller stuff
09:06	<z0man>	I guess my X will dissappear for a while

09:07	<Zorlin>	Yes evil?
09:07	<evil>	why not?
09:07	<radar1976>	quick question... I have 6.10 that didn't finish it's upgrade... can i use the alternate cd to finish the upgrade?
09:07	<Zorlin>	Because x64 architechture isnt that great right now...
09:07	<xange_>	when I ssh into my box from my mac I can't backspace...anybody have any suggestions?
09:07	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, thanks, will try that now
09:07	<z0man>	reconfigure what now? (sorry)
09:07	<Zorlin>	x86 apps must be ported to x64 to run it on 64 bit
09:07	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ok
09:07	<Moniker42>	radar1976, i think you'll have to do a fresh install - but verify that with someone else first :)
09:07	<z0man>	reconfigure[something]  dont exist when I press TAB
09:08	<Zorlin>	or run through a compatibility layer or hypervisor or something.
09:08	<evil>	well not so bad,for now i am at the beginning with linux and i keep as second choice in dual boot
09:08	<grok_linux>	when i increase resolution the screen resizes but doesn't "fit" to the screen. i end up having to scroll to the sides. also, resolution will only go to 1024x768 while in win i can take it to 1600x1200.
09:08	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: in translation, it means "go to text mode, reconfigure xorg again, go back to gfx mode"
09:08	<Zorlin>	zoman, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
09:08	<z0man>	aha
09:08	<radar1976>	anyone verify that answer?
09:08	<z0man>	sorry

09:08	<glaeven>	does anyone know for sure if a netgear wireless card (wg311) works?
09:08	<Zorlin>	Immolo: I mean that some things like wine and flash dont like 64 bit
09:08	<MetaMorfoziS>	Automatical means, when other machone conencts on eth2.
09:08	<Zorlin>	you have to force them to work which isnt as easy as it sounds
09:09	<Impaque>	immolo: there are some driver and h/w issues
09:09	<Zorlin>	and its daunting for new users.
09:09	<immolo>	Zorlin-  wine is fine :P but flash you have issues
09:09	<evil>	anyway,could someone come in pvt to help me plz? with all these ppl i going crazy :)
09:09	<Zorlin>	Yes immolo: Wine is alright because the developers kick ass...
09:09	<Prognatus>	Hello, I have a problem: if I boot with the screen cable out, Ubuntu defaults to 640x480. I've tried to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf but it didn't work. How do I tell Ubuntu to always boot 1280x1024 in 24-bit colors?
09:09	<ccannon>	   if I have an apt-get update running in a term win in xwindows, and I restart xwin, will the apt-get update stop?
09:09	<Zorlin>	and they actually PORTED it to 64 bit, which is nice of them
09:09	<Jack3>	is it possible for firefox to see windows media player in webpage streams?
09:09	<Jack3>	it says i need a plugin
09:09	<bullgard4>	What is a 'RAD tool'? See for example http://www.roebling.de/
09:09	<jasin>	if you want to know if your hardware will work check the hcl
09:10	<Zorlin>	Prognatus: Do you need the other resolutions?
09:10	<jasin>	for wireless see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
09:10	<Zorlin>	If not I suggest you use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, to disable all resolutions except 1280x1024.
09:10	<Impaque>	Prognatus: 640x480 should be enough for anybody (tm)
09:10	<xtknight>	oftentimes my Trash doesnt appear full when it should be.  anyone else have this trouble?
09:10	<Prognatus>	Zorlin, No. I only need 1280x1024.
09:10	<crow>	makkk i have same question cant connect my wirelles to wireless router WPA(PSK)
09:10	<immolo>	Zorlin-  and as long as you don't have some old binary driver everything just works for hardware
09:10	<Prognatus>	Impaque: hehe
09:10	<tushar>	gnomefreak:  how do i enable my nvidia card beryl compatible

09:12	<grok_linux>	when i increase resolution the screen resizes but doesn't "fit" to the screen. i end up having to scroll to the sides. also, resolution will only go to 1024x768 while in win i can take it to 1600x1200.
09:12	<Zorlin>	z0man, you dont have xserver-xorg?
09:12	<bullgard4>	vox754: I will think about your answer. Thank you.
09:12	<Huffalump>	How can I set which soundcard is activated on boot?  I have an Audigy card as well as on-board nForce3.  Each boot, Ubuntu chooses a different one and I have to move the speaker cable.  I'd like to set one and move on.  How?
09:12	<crow>	jasin well it isnt good as i cant connect to wirelles...
09:12	<makkk>	crow. one sec

09:13	<z0man>	Cuz I installed that xserver-xgl I believe
09:13	<Huffalump>	adrian_  There is no need to be dramatic.  What you you mean by "GG"?  And if you prefer polski, you can join #ubuntu-pl
09:13	<mass>	when I try to turn on GL desktop my window titlebars disappear
09:13	<PriceChild>	Juanca, try a slower speed
09:13	<Zorlin>	Z0man, did you type it EXACTLY correct?
09:13	<Zorlin>	xserver-xorg is the name.
09:13	<z0man>	yup
09:13	<Zorlin>	no capitals/
09:13	<makkk>	crow: here, under networking improvements http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704tour
09:14	<Impaque>	Juanca: is the md5sum of your .iso file on your harddrive ok?
09:14	<PriceChild>	evil, can I help you?
09:14	<z0man>	yup on the no capitals
09:14	<z0man>	i try brb
09:14	<Impaque>	Juanca: maybe it's not because of the faulty medium (CDs)
09:14	<demo_>	where do i put xmms skins?
09:14	<Huffalump>	PriceChild, I think they meant "oops"
09:14	<randomwalker>	does anyone know how to make the computer wake up from suspend at a fixed time?
09:14	<PriceChild>	Huffalump, ahhh :)
09:14	<Juanca>	PriceChild: I've tried with the slower speed available (8x)
09:14	<Ashex>	anyone have suggestions on what command to use for backups?
09:14	<apokryphos>	demo_: have you considered not using xmms?
09:14	<Zorlin>	PriceChild: Hi!
09:14	<Ashex>	I can't for the life of me remember what command I was using before
09:14	<Juanca>	Impaque: I'ce checked the checksum
09:14	<PriceChild>	Juanca, did you check the md5sum of the iso?
09:14	<Ashex>	I had it setup as a cronjob
09:14	<notclive>	I'm getting this error when I run metacity "Window manager warning: "" found in configuration database is not a valid value for keybinding "toggle_shaded"" any ideas?
09:14	<Juanca>	Impaque: The iso is right
09:14	<makkk>	Ashex, rsync?
09:14	<jasin>	crow, this is the offical wireless troubleshooting guide, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessTroubleShootingGuide
09:15	<jasin>	crow, see that
09:15	<demo_>	apokryphos: no
09:15	<Impaque>	Juanca: hm... maybe at slower speed? data-at-once?
09:15	<crow>	jasin thnx will check
09:15	<jano_>	hi will the gimp 2.3 appear in repositories??
09:15	<Ashex>	makkk, ah, I think that's what I was using. had it doing local backuos :)
09:15	<AaronMT>	Just to let anyone know who is running Ubuntu on a Dell Inspiron 1501, this is your new favourite site/blog http://ubuntu1501.blogspot.com/
09:15	<crow>	makkk you could also check the link that jasin gave us
09:15	<crow>	:)
09:15	<sanityx>	AaronMT, Yeah I love that site
09:15	<apokryphos>	demo_: there are other more mature and featureful players; it's worth trying them out.
09:15	<Juanca>	Impaque: I burned it at 8x in two different machines
09:15	<sanityx>	AaronMT, Btw, don't upgrade your bios.
09:15	<mass>	has anyone seen the problem where when you turn on GL desktop the window titlebars disappear?
09:15	<imbecile>	!upgrade
09:15	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
09:15	<apokryphos>	AaronMT: no spam please
09:16	<makkk>	crow: looking at it

09:16	<AaronMT>	sanityx im running 2.1 I think
09:16	<sanityx>	apokryphos, Its not spam. that site is awesome
09:16	<Zorlin>	Apok! Hi :P
09:16	<sanityx>	AaronMT, 2.4 wont boot feisty
09:16	<rmd_>	are there any apps in the repos that will backup a directory to an ftp server on a regular basis?
09:16	<sanityx>	AaronMT, do you have 2.1 with fiesty?
09:16	<crow>	makkk and the network mennager isnt like that in any conntent :(((((
09:16	<demo_>	apokryphos: i am not looking for something mature and featureful, thanks.
09:16	<demo_>	where do i put xmms skins?
09:16	<AaronMT>	sanityx, yeah I never flashed my bios, its the one that came with this
09:16	<sanityx>	AaronMT, yeah well, dont.

09:17	<askar>	when will feistys repositories be "unfreezed"?
09:17	<demo_>	thanks deserteagle
09:17	<sanityx>	shawn34, you cant unless it has ssh or vnc or or FreeNX or something like that
09:17	<Agrajag>	askar: what do you mean "unfreezed"?
09:17	<jrib>	askar: never
09:17	<Agrajag>	mass: you can get help with that stuff in #ubuntu-effects I think
09:17	<shawn34>	sanityx, ubuntu has remote desktop vncviewer on it
09:17	<randomwalker>	kalarm sounds interesting. i wish gnome would have something like it
09:17	<deserteagle>	huh?
09:18	<grok_linux>	np
09:18	<grok_linux>	when i increase resolution the screen resizes but doesn't "fit" to the screen. i end up having to scroll to the sides. also, resolution will only go to 1024x768 while in win i can take it to 1600x1200.
09:18	<sanityx>	only viewer?
09:18	<con-man>	Can I upgrade to fiesty without issues?
09:18	<sanityx>	wait are you trying to view a remote laptop that is RUNNING ubuntu, or just from ubuntu
09:18	<gustavold>	I'd like to know what is the better kernel, "linux-image-<version>-386" or "linux-image-<version>-generic" ?
09:18	<gustavold>	my settings: model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3500+
09:18	<con-man>	do I have format and reinstall
09:18	<dwt>	con-man: my girlfriend did that
09:18	<RasQulec>	con-man: its possible
09:18	<PriceChild>	!upgrade >	con-man
09:18	<dwt>	and the only issue she got was that sound stopped working
09:18	<skalca>	any slovenijan there
09:18	<dwt>	which was fixed by starting alsa-mixer
09:18	<con-man>	There is an upgrade button  on my update manager
09:18	<dwt>	and fiddling a bit with it. :)
09:19	<iNfliCtEd_PAiN>	skalca: kinda :>
09:19	<sanityx>	con-man, may as well try it before doing a full reinstall.
09:19	<evil>	PriceChild: you could help me but in pvt, can't really understand anything with all these ppl here
09:19	<mrenner>	help
09:19	<PriceChild>	evil, I don't know whether I could help you out... what's the problem?
09:19	<z0man>	sodit tbh I installed ubuntu to get rid of that complicated life of linux i used to have there installing machines
09:19	<z0man>	thx anyways
09:19	<con-man>	trying it now
09:19	<Huffalump>	My Audigy card was working just fine during a previous Edgy ->	Feisty.  I had cause to do a fresh install, however, and now my Audigy is mostly static with very little real sound (although you can recognize it through the distortion).  Where do I begin to fix this?
09:19	<randomwalker>	skiguy: thanks
09:19	<con-man>	I hope it doesnt bork it
09:20	<peeps>	if I get an SATA/RAID controller card that does not support RAID 5, can I still do it in software on Linux?
09:20	<evil>	wireless, i have no DHCP and WPA2, so i choose WPA2 from the bar but not IP, or viceversa :(
09:20	<z0man>	I just may reinstall ubuntu and let it correct it self.
09:20	<Impaque>	peeps: if the drives are detected without probs, yes
09:20	<jano_>	what packages do I need to run the chess that came with feisty in 3d?
09:20	<rmd_>	hmm
09:20	<rmd_>	my "cube" option has stopped working, even tho it is selected
09:20	<Huffalump>	jano_ If you install via Synaptic, it should grab all the packages you need.
09:21	<con-man>	does fiesty use the newest kernel
09:21	<z0man>	I'm hoping that Nvidia accepts the idea of ubuntu's driver set up
09:21	<jano_>	Huffalump, it came preinstalled, but not wiht 3d
=== iNfliCtEd_PAiN is now known as omgitsbc
09:21	<Huffalump>	con-man 2.6.20

09:21	<Impaque>	peeps: yes
09:21	<con-man>	Huffalump: what is the newest stable kernel
09:21	<ompaul>	!raid
09:21	<ubotu>	Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
09:21	<z0man>	overwise I may as well just download the Nvidia driver :P
09:21	<ompaul>	ohh dear
09:22	<Huffalump>	con-man http://www.kernel.org/
09:22	<peeps>	Impaque, do you know roughly how much CPU impact there is for software RAID 5?
09:22	<jano_>	Huffalump, it said it needs: OpenGL Python bindings and the GtkGLExt Python bindings., I installed both but still cant run 3d
09:22	<tuxplorer>	any issues with dist upgrading from edgy to feisty?
09:22	<PriceChild>	ompaul, ?
09:22	<Huffalump>	jano_ I see.  I'll have to let someone else help you.  Keep trying.
09:22	<Prognatus>	Zorlin, "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org" yields an error message saying it can't find the file. Tried also with xserver.org...
09:22	<jasin>	I get an error at startup.
09:22	<Zorlin>	Prognatus
09:22	<Nessieliberation>	i have a problem with feisty resolution: via unichrome pro chipset, but i can load a blank x server, or a flux WM at correct resolution
09:22	<ompaul>	PriceChild, that raid is so sad it needs one more url
09:22	<Huffalump>	tuxplorer, many people no, some people yes
09:22	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, you should let synaptic do it for you...
09:22	<PriceChild>	:)
09:22	<Zorlin>	Prognatus: Its called xserver-*XORG*
09:22	<Zorlin>	not org, xorg.
09:23	<andruu>	hello, i am on a macbook pro and for the life of me can't get a right click to work
09:23	<evil>	PriceChild:  wireless, i have no DHCP and WPA2, so i choose WPA2 from the bar but not IP, or viceversa :(
09:23	<andruu>	any suggestions?
09:23	<Impaque>	peeps: not sure, but for any decent CPU it's neglible, imho
09:23	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, i am a little scared now
09:23	<eidauk>	how do I tell Feisty what monitor I have?
09:23	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, otherwise you might end up with some serious issues >.>
09:23	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: haha why
09:23	<PriceChild>	evil, i'm not good with wireless sorry
09:23	<Kraeloc>	impaque: item one: my left click does not work anymore
09:23	<jasin>	wpa2 is supported?
09:23	<Zorlin>	prognatus: xserver-xorg, not xserver-org
09:23	<Prognatus>	Zorlin, ok! :)
09:23	<PriceChild>	eidauk, you shouldn't have to
09:23	<evil>	jasin: yes
09:23	<PriceChild>	eidauk, what is your real aim?
09:23	<bluefox83>	andruu, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver
09:23	<Zorlin>	Have fun prognatus, hope that solves your problem.
09:23	<evil>	jasin: but is a mess if you also need to set a static IP
09:23	<Zorlin>	bluefox83, its xserver-xorg, not xorg-xserver.
09:23	<jano_>	what is the package for the chess in fesity called?
09:23	<bluefox83>	right!
09:24	<Kraeloc>	impaque: item two: when i do telinit 1 and the sudo dpkg etc..., it gives an error about needing an action item or soemthing
09:24	<bluefox83>	i got it backwards again :X
09:24	<makkk>	crow: what do you mean 'and the network manager isnt like that in any content'?
09:24	<peeps>	Impaque, do you know if it is possible to expand a software RAID 5 by another drive without reformatting the array
09:24	<jasin>	evil, I would nver use a static ip over wireless
09:24	<bluefox83>	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
09:24	<eidauk>	wrong resolution. I had the same prob in kubuntu but once i told it what monitor i had, it fixed the prob
09:24	<stefg>	peeps: man mdadm
09:24	<Kraeloc>	item three: ctrl-alt-f1 no longer does anything either
09:24	<tuxplorer>	bluefox83: I need to first upgrade my apt right? can you point me to some place where I can get the new apt source list? or would synaptic do that too for me?
09:24	<Prognatus>	Zorlin, Thanks again. This channel scrolls so fast by when I'm in 640x480 mode, that I wrote down the command too fast... and got it wrong. Will try again! :)
09:24	<z0man>	Zorlin I just found the refresh rates are back.   But i think I'll reinstall
09:24	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, synaptic will do it for you
09:24	<rmd_>	whenever i select the "cube" desktop effect, the system is reduced to 1 workspace.  when i add more workspaces and switch between them, they do not use the "cube" option.  can i fix this?
09:24	<peeps>	ok thx stefg
09:24	<Kraeloc>	impaque: oh, and my trackpad still doesn't work
09:25	<Juanca>	Is ot reeeally important for the CD to pass it's own checking for defects?
09:25	<Huffalump>	Help with sound.  On the Audigy card, sound is mostly static with very little real sound (although you can recognize it through the distortion).  Where do I begin to fix this?
09:25	<Impaque>	peeps: having the design of raid5 in mind, i guess not.
09:25	<z0man>	thx for your help :)
09:25	<Impaque>	peeps: but do google it up
09:25	<jasin>	no encryption is secure, wep, wpa, wpa2 have all been cracked.

09:25	<evil>	jasin: how would you use it?
09:25	<rmd_>	bluefox83, 2
09:25	<tuxplorer>	bluefox83: I've never used the synaptic GUI till date.. am unable to find an option called dist upgrade.., where is it?

09:25	<rwissner>	My mouse froze after Wormux crashed - do you have any suggestions how I could restore it without restarting X?
09:25	<vustar>	http://pingpong.serveblog.net
09:25	<ompaul>	peeps, that first one is nice the rest are I have a system and now I want to add raid (yuk)
09:26	<ApesMa>	The Edgy->Feisty upgrade seems to have left diversions lying around that keep me from installing nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new. I want to try to use dpkg-divert to manually get rid of the diversions, but can't figure out which pathname goes first in the command line. The diversions file that lists diversions lists things in sets of three lines: path1, path2, package. Which of the two paths should go first in the dpkg-divert command line?
09:26	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: hmm, the reconfigure should've reconfigured it as it was from the time you installed it the first time.. are you sure you were in pure textmode?
09:26	<jasin>	evil, it was setup by default on my system all I had to do is enter the keyring pass.
09:26	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: (when you did the reconfigure, that is)
09:26	<rmd_>	bluefox83, but setting it to have more doesn't help
09:26	<Zorlin>	z0man: You're welcome
09:26	<crow>	makkk the image in 7.04 tour and my network menager that i mean
09:26	<jasin>	evil, i didn't do anything the ubuntu install did it all for me.
09:26	<Zorlin>	Prognatus: Have fun buddy
09:26	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, you don't use dist-upgrade with it...you tell it to "reload" and it'll find out that there's a new release
09:26	<g35>	anyone here ever used gfxboot?
09:26	<Zorlin>	Anyone else need help?
=== finalbeta_ is now known as finalbeta
09:26	<stefg>	ompaul: but the mdadm manual page is one of the few which are indeed useful :-), too
09:26	<darnell>	i need help, a lot of the packages are being kept back.. and it doesnt tell me why
09:26	<makkk>	crow, you meant you're not getting that functionality either
09:26	<tuxplorer>	bluefox83: Thanks
09:26	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i did what you told me too: ctrl-alt-f1, then sudo telinit 1, then dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg
09:27	<knt>	hi!
09:27	<bluefox83>	rmd_, i don't know...i've never really used the cube before..i used it a few times in edgy to play with it..but not since upgrading to feisty
09:27	<ardchoille>	Seveas: I am reading https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages but I don't see a section for Fesity. Does your repo support feisty yet?
09:27	<knt>	got a n00b question
09:27	<rmd_>	i've also noticed that any changes i make to the "cube" option reduce my workspace number.  if i turn it off or on, i lose all but one workspace
09:27	<Huffalump>	!ask | knt
09:27	<ubotu>	knt: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
09:27	<knt>	does feisty fawn work with ".ko" modules?
09:27	<rmd_>	oh
09:27	<Huffalump>	knt yes
09:27	<ompaul>	stefg, yeap, but read that web page - fools guide to raid - it makes it too easy there is no real hard sys admin in it

09:27	<Prognatus>	Zorlin. Thanks. It found the file now. ...but should I select Autodectect hardware or Manual config in the first step?
09:27	<peeps>	does feisty require the alternate CD for RAID support?
09:27	<g35>	Zorlin, hi
09:27	<Kraeloc>	impaque: perhaps, though, it was the dpkg reconfig that i did before i followed your directions that fucked it up
09:27	<knt>	I updated from 6.10 to FF and it detected my ".ko" modules as not permitted format
09:27	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, when you tell it to reload, it'll update all your sources, and say there's a new version available..click on the upgrade button because doing it any other way would be a serious migrane
09:27	<evil>	jasin: ok, but i decided to turn off DHCP on router and use WPA2
09:27	<ApesMa>	knt: I believe the switch to .ko happened w/2.6 kernel, so yes.
09:27	<ompaul>	peeps, they all do
09:27	<pleasebenice>	what app can i use on ubuntu to simply rip a dvd possibly with drm even if it may have some read errors

09:28	<rmd_>	next question: i need an automated backup program that will upload the contents of a directory to an ftp site in the background.  any thoughts, given what is in the repos?
09:28	<Prognatus>	Zorlin, Ok. :)
09:28	<Zorlin>	All that matters is the resolution selection area but make sure not to screw with the settings too much

09:28	<stefg>	!backup
09:28	<Zorlin>	Just hit enter throughout it if your not sure.
09:28	<ubotu>	There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !sbackup and !cloning
09:28	<rmd_>	wow
09:28	<rmd_>	thanks
09:28	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, did you get a little notification down on your taskbar saying there are updates available?
09:28	<jasin>	evil, you don't need to turn off dhcp to use wpa2, at least not protocol wise.
09:28	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: you entered that "wizard" and you followed instructions?
09:29	<kahrytan>	!cloning
09:29	<ubotu>	To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type "dpkg --get-selections >	~/my-packages", move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type "sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade" - See also !automate
09:29	<knt>	well, when does edgy distro support finish?
09:29	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i did, but that was before i knew i need text-only mode
09:29	<tuxplorer>	bluefox83: It says some 20k packages to upgrade.. but doesn't say that a new release has come
09:29	<raboof>	how does ubuntu determine to which partition to suspend? CONFIG_PM_STD_PARTITION does not seem to be set, and n'either is a 'resume='-parameter passed to the kernel (at least, not in /boot/grub/menu.lst)

09:30	<barteks>	hi

09:33	<jasin>	evil, so? you still have ports open every system does and clossing ports off does not secure it just tells someone which ports are still open.
09:33	<Dial_tone>	why isn't this woring - "for i in *.jpg; do convert $i `basename $i gif`; done"
09:33	<Dial_tone>	it seems to run; it just doesn't convert anything

09:41	<Impaque>	no, from first terminal (ctrl+alt+f1)
09:42	<aoirthoir>	gireesh, yes we got that..is there a site that lists all or many available perhaps?
09:42	<aoirthoir>	gireesh, thanks for the tip btw
09:42	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i mean, i have to do the sudo telinit 2 in a console window first?
09:42	<Kraeloc>	since i can't get anything through ctrl-alt-f1
09:42	<Kraeloc>	impaque: since i can't get anything through ctrl-alt-f1
09:43	<Och4>	whats the channel for beryl
09:43	<Och4>	help
09:43	<aoirthoir>	#beryl
09:43	<PriceChild>	Och4, #ubuntu-effects
09:43	<xtknight>	why is my swap being used when my physical ram is only half full/
09:43	<xtknight>	e.g. 512mb swap used, 900/2 gigs phys used
09:43	<aoirthoir>	thanks for the tips:)
09:43	<aoirthoir>	brb
09:43	<Nessieliberation>	xtknight, because its more efficient that way
09:43	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: maybe you should just reboot to first runlevel by adding "1" (without quotes) to the boot line, and then do the abovementioned (ctrl+alt+f1 and then sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop etc etc)
09:44	<zPacKRat_>	does anyone know how to blacklist an SSID in network manager?
09:44	<kludge>	hi i just installed feisty (ez + smooth) and the same thing happens as when i tried to use beryl before: my desktop background gets cutoff on my second monitor and there is residue of any window i put there over a white background..
09:44	<PriceChild>	xtknight, to leave enough ram incase something suddenly needs to use it
09:44	<Agrajag>	xtknight: stuff that isn't being used will be swapped out to leave physical ram free in case it's needed in a hurry
09:44	<xtknight>	Nessieliberation, more efficient to use spam than ram/
09:44	<thepumpkin1979_>	i'm trying to compile vmware 5 and it doest not support feisty kernel headers. somebody knows about it?
09:44	<xtknight>	but why wouldnt it put whats in the swap now and mark it 'immediately remove when needed'.  or is that what it's doing
09:44	<Kraeloc>	impaque: please spare me...
09:44	<xtknight>	spam rofl
09:45	<xtknight>	i mean swap8
09:45	<Nessieliberation>	xtknight, i would guess swap is being used for inactive caching
09:45	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: dude, then just revert to pre-dpkg-reconfigure config and you spare ME..
09:45	<Nessieliberation>	which wouldnt get a big performance increase from being in ram
09:45	<stefg>	thepumpkin1979: known problem, you need the any-any patch.. /j #vmware
09:45	<RobbieCrash>	On boot I get the following error: firmware_helper[4457] : main: error loading '/lib/firmware/bcm43xx_microcode.fw' for decice '/class/firmware/0000:02:08.0' with driver '(unknown)' and then another error saying that .fw file is not available or failed to load
09:45	<danboland>	hey guys, quick question; i decided to renistall ubuntu(ussing 7.04) after having uses another distro, problem is every time the cd tries to boot x.org it crashes.  i didn't have this problem with previous versions of ubuntu.  its a ati x1400 card.  is it posible to un the nsstallation trhough the command line? like clasic debian
09:45	<Nessieliberation>	but keeps the ram free for stuff which would need it
09:45	<RobbieCrash>	The message seems to repeat every few minutes
09:45	<xtknight>	Nessieliberation, ahh hmm.  let me rephrase it.  what's in swap now is also in ram, probably / hmm my shift key is rboken
09:45	<RobbieCrash>	This is on a fresh feisty install.
09:46	<llj>	zPacKRat_: start gconf-editor and remove them from /system/networking/wireless
09:46	<RasQulec>	xtnight how much swap is used? is it morethen you have free ram?
09:46	<Bibagi>	Hi help plz my Giam closing automatically :S why ?  :S
09:46	<Agrajag>	danboland: yes, with the alternate install cd
09:46	<Nessieliberation>	xtknight, i also heard rumours that many system monitors dont show cahing of the kernel etc on the ram side
09:46	<xtknight>	RasQulec, well 500 swap out of 7 gigs used.  1000 megs physical out of 2000 used
09:46	<xtknight>	ahh
09:46	<xtknight>	gnome-system-monitor maybe it's misinterpreting
09:46	<Kraeloc>	impaque: that is what i am trying to do
09:46	<Bibagi>	also crashing if some one tries to send me file
09:46	<polo>	I have problem with grub, I have installed it in (hd0,0) o now I cannot load windows, how can I restore windows MBR without windows?
09:46	<carlhempel>	Bibagi, did you run an Update by chance? maybe there is a fix ...
09:46	<stefg>	!grub
09:46	<ubotu>	grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
09:46	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i'm sorry, i don't mean to be impolite or anything
09:46	<RasQulec>	xtnight sometimes when it does hit swap it doesnt take it out of swap until you need it even if you have free ram now
09:46	<Kraeloc>	impaque: this is just a bit stressful
09:46	<Horscht>	is there something like ICS on Linux/ubuntu?
09:47	<xtknight>	i do understand the concept of 'get rid of ram when a new app needs it'  but there's more physical left than swap used
09:47	<danboland>	aww, so i go to waste another cd.... i guess i can use this cd for another comp.  thanks, i'll go download it.  any idea what changed between versions that would cause it to fail now?
09:47	<xtknight>	500m of it ;o
09:47	<kludge>	why does beryl make part of my desktop go white and with tracers of windows?? its about 400px on the right of my 2560x1024 display...
09:47	<kritzstapf>	which packet contains "xv"?
09:47	<Nessieliberation>	xtknight, do you have the Ksystem monitor installed? that showed me different things from the gnome one once
09:47	<Pelo>	polo,  is your windows install on the same hdd ?
09:47	<stefg>	!firestarter | Horscht
09:47	<ubotu>	Horscht: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
09:47	<kitsuneofdoom>	hey, I'm using xubuntu 7.04. I have the sound going to a speaker/amp, which is monaural input. I'm only getting one channel coming through. Any way to merge both channels before sending them out
09:47	<xtknight>	Nessieliberation, hm nope ksysguard/ let me give it a shot
09:47	<Agrajag>	xtknight: what does "free -m" tell you?
09:47	<Bibagi>	carlhempel : how to do that ? i just want to find update for Gaim only is that possible ?
09:47	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: are you in gnome at the moment?
09:47	<zPacKRat_>	llj: awsome!
09:47	<Kraeloc>	impaque: yes
=== lan3y is now known as Laney
09:47	<Agrajag>	xtknight: I have 2 GB and almost all of it is in use, as it should be
09:47	<RasQulec>	kitsuneofdoom: alsa may have soem settings somewhere to use mono sound
09:47	<xtknight>	Agrajag, ah it tells me 1968 used physical though that's probably allocated not 'used'
09:48	<Agrajag>	xtknight: right now 1.5 gigs of my ram is being used for buffers
09:48	<Nessieliberation>	xtknight, that's the one i meant
09:48	<kitsuneofdoom>	RasQulec: k
09:48	<xtknight>	ah
09:48	<aimes>	:D
09:48	<Agrajag>	xtknight: it is used, linux will use as much physical ram as possible for disk caching
09:48	<RasQulec>	kitsuneofdoom: look for some alsa configuration pages online
09:48	<Huffalump>	My sound card is mostly static with very little sound.  How can I fix this?  Yes, I've checked the alsamixer which gives me sound with lots of static.  Feisty, fresh install, Audigy SoundBlaster.
09:48	<Agrajag>	xtknight: among other things
09:48	<Alon_005>	Thank you very much for your help. Velko.
09:48	<Nessieliberation>	and that doesnt always show
09:48	<Alon_005>	I'll be on my way.
09:48	<xtknight>	Agrajag, ah i see.  so maybe my 500m of used swap is in that 1900megs of phys ram also
09:48	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ok, ctrl+alt+F1 will get you to the first terminal. from there, after you login as user, you can issue /etc/init.d/?dm stop .. to stop xorg/gnome.. then you do the sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg .. and restart gnome: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm start
09:48	<xtknight>	thats my guess
09:48	<RasQulec>	Huffalump: did you fix the digital output switch in alsamixer?
09:49	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: write it down this time please ;)
09:49	<Huffalump>	RasQulec, I'll google that and try it.  Thanks
09:49	<RasQulec>	xtknight: yes that could be true
09:49	<ikkebr>	anyone running opera in feisty?
09:49	<Agrajag>	xtknight: no, that would kind of defeat the purpose of swap space
09:49	<forQed>	I just got Opera working with an update today
09:49	<xtknight>	Agrajag, why...when a new app needed the phys ram it oculd just get rid of the physical ram and itd be also in the swap, synchronized.
09:49	<petriborg>	is there an official howto somewhere on turning on beryl for feisty?
09:49	<Agrajag>	xtknight: there's definitely something in your swap space, it's just stuff you don't need now and haven't used in a long time
09:49	<RasQulec>	Agrajag: that would make it so if it needed the ram it wouldnt have to copy to swap since its already in swap.
09:49	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i have been writing all of this down, but due to SOMETHING i did earlier, ctrl-alt-f1 doesn't do anything anymore
09:49	<forQed>	Until todays update Opera would not owrk
09:49	<xtknight>	yea
09:49	<Juanca>	anyone could help me with this problem (http://pastebin.ca/451721) with the 7.04 installation CD??
09:49	<RobbieCrash>	On boot I get the following error: firmware_helper[4457] : main: error loading '/lib/firmware/bcm43xx_microcode.fw' for decice '/class/firmware/0000:02:08.0' with driver '(unknown)' and then another error saying that .fw file is not available or failed to load. the message repeats every few minutes. This is on a fresh feisty install.
09:50	<Agrajag>	RasQulec: why would you put your swap space in ram, that makes no sense
09:50	<Nessieliberation>	forQed, which update?
09:50	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: hm, try to restart then?
09:50	<Agrajag>	or even cache it to ram
09:50	<POVaddct>	RobbieCrash: got the firmware for bcm43xx installed?
09:50	<Horscht>	stefg, ICS as in "internet connection sharing"
09:50	<RasQulec>	Kraeloc: I have the same problem, I can no longer use ctrl-alt-f1 unless I am logged out
09:50	<forQed>	an update for Opera was brought up in my automatic updates
09:50	<xtknight>	Agrajag, because it's slower to read from swap.  when there's free ram you'd want to use it somehow/
09:50	<RobbieCrash>	I have no idea what bcm43xx is
09:50	<Horscht>	let a deivce connected to NIC2 use the internet connection in NIC1
09:50	<washbear>	i need a gui for maping/binding multimedia keys - tried many, can't to work :(
09:50	<Kraeloc>	rasqulec: mine doesn't even work then :(
09:50	<Nessieliberation>	oki, so not the kernel update i thought i might have seen
09:50	<RasQulec>	Agrajag: no, you have it stored in both places so you dont have to wait for it to copy to the hd when you need that ram area, you just clear the ram area out and use it
09:50	<Agrajag>	xtknight: right, and the prupose of swap is to store things you don't need in a slower store
09:50	<Huffalump>	RasQulec, can you point me in the right direction?  I don't see where to change that.
09:51	<forQed>	I installed Opera with Automatix
09:51	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i will try restarting
09:51	<Agrajag>	RasQulec: that would work
09:51	<xtknight>	Agrajag, ah so swap is what i dont need/
09:51	<Nessieliberation>	automatix is EVIL!
09:51	<xtknight>	sorry my shift key is broken ;\
09:51	<RobbieCrash>	oh, it's for my wireless car which I don't even use.
09:51	<Agrajag>	xtknight: 7 gigs of swap is a little excessive.
09:51	<POVaddct>	RobbieCrash: a wireless lan card from broadcom. looks like you have one in your computer.
09:51	<PriceChild>	!automatix >	forQed
09:51	<Agrajag>	I have 2GB of ram, and 1 of swap
09:51	<forQed>	It may be evil... but I am willing to go to evil for things to work
09:51	<vera>	Could anybody help me with a wlan problem?
09:51	<Nessieliberation>	forQed, but there are other easy ways to get what it offers
09:51	<RobbieCrash>	POVaddct Yeah, but it's not in use, how can I get rid of these warning messages?
09:51	<xtknight>	Agrajag, for virtual machines/etc and just for worst-case.  i have plenty of hd to use
09:51	<ScottSatkin>	!helpme | vera
09:51	<ubotu>	vera: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
09:51	<RasQulec>	Huffalump: on my comptuer go to the volume control and then edit-
09:52	<Nessieliberation>	especially in feisty
09:52	<POVaddct>	RobbieCrash: you could blacklist the bcm43xx module so it won't be loaded anymore
09:52	<RasQulec>	Huffalump: on my comptuer go to the volume control and then edit->	preferences and enable all the stuff in there, and then goto the switches tab on the main window and play with the digital out checkbox
09:52	<washbear>	!multimediakeys >	washbear
09:52	<scarter>	Nessieliberation: why is automatix evil? i was just about to install when i saw your comment.
09:52	<xtknight>	thanks Agrajag, Nessieliberation , RasQulec  for the info
09:52	<RobbieCrash>	POVaddct how would I do that?
09:52	<RasQulec>	Huffalump: on my computer I* is what I meant
09:52	<POVaddct>	!blacklist
09:52	<ubotu>	To blacklist a module, edit /etc/modprobe.d/my_blacklist and add  blacklist <modulename>	 to the end of that list - To explicitly load modules in a specific order, list them in /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and type  sudo update-initramfs -u 
09:52	<Nessieliberation>	scarter, it screws up the update manager
09:52	<Horscht>	!automatix
09:52	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a proprietary script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
09:52	<Nessieliberation>	!automatix
09:53	<RasQulec>	xtknight: you are welcome
09:53	<vera>	ScottSatkin: :) Thanks for the hint, here I go.
09:53	<POVaddct>	RobbieCrash: look what ubotu said
09:53	<vera>	Hi there! Could somebody help me with a wlan usb stick problem? I just baught a "msi us54se", because the linux support was said to be good. It works great too, if I only use unencrypted networks that is. It doesn't seem to work with my 128bit wep-encrypted network though. Any Ideas?
09:53	<NemesisD>	does smbmount not work on ubuntu or something?
09:53	<ruggy>	is there a place i could go to read about how well ubuntu will work on my latop?
09:53	<RobbieCrash>	POVaddct thanks
09:53	<Huffalump>	RasQulec, I'm sorry you are busy, I know.... My Computer?  Isn't that a Windows thing?  I have the volume control open, you are suggesting I check all the boxes?
09:53	<scarter>	Nessieliberation: is there a better option? doesn't necessarily need to be so noob-ish.
09:53	<LjL>	!laptop >	ruggy    (ruggy, see the private message from Ubotu)
09:53	<Nessieliberation>	ruggy, liveCD
09:53	<washbear>	ruggy - just download the install CD and see for yourself!
09:53	<ikkebr>	!worksforme
09:53	<ubotu>	Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
09:53	<Nessieliberation>	scarter, what from it do you want particularly
09:53	<ch0pst1x-ubuntu>	gah now to find out how to get to quakenet >_>
09:53	<xtknight>	any idea why my shift key and capslock would just malfunction/
09:53	<forQed>	Automatix has never caused problems for me, but used to be pretty bad for many systems
09:53	<xtknight>	it's so odd
09:54	<NemesisD>	or let me rephrase, how do i mount a shared computer via SMB

09:55	<xtknight>	doomster, you probably need to grab firmware with fwcutter and place it in /lib/firmware/
09:55	<Bibagi>	Nessieliberation teitunge thanks ... is there any other messenger... which is more stable them gaim. cause gaim is crashing like hell :S:S:S

09:59	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: yep, after /etc/init.d/?dm stop you should end up in textmode
09:59	<Huffalump>	RasQulec, thanks!  That worked just fine!  Uncheck the digital audio switch and modify the advanced Output settings in VLC.  Works brilliant.  Much appreciated.
09:59	<jenda>	PriceChild: 3 messages a week isn't too bad, is it? :)
09:59	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok
09:59	<spyke_>	anyone have time and patience with a recent upgrader? ATI graphics card, "composite exteension is not available"... and my desktop fonts look like poop
09:59	<RasQulec>	Huffalump: good to hear :D

10:00	<jmelloy>	so anyway

10:00	<scarter>	Nessieliberation: sorry, missed the last... on AMD64 - adobe flash, dvd codecs (restricted), realplayer, crossover.
10:00	<Prognatus>	Zorlin: That helped somewhat to reconfigure xserver, now it boots with 1024x768 instead of 640x480. I deselected every resolution other than 1280x1024 in the config. Why does it boot then in 1024x768?
10:01	<haru>	why cant i see the users on the channel :S

10:02	<johnm_>	I think I have a similar problem as Prognatus
10:02	<Agrajag>	n2diy: you installed a new version of the kernel. You cannot replace a running kernel. you have to reboot.

10:06	<xtknight>	RasQulec, for example, when copying a 20 gig file from one disk to the other it slows down my usage, why is that?

10:14	<CPrgmSwR2>	Its not AMD thats the problem... Windows Vista requires all hardware connect to it to have DRM incorperated into it in order to view the extremely high video resolution.. What this translates too is that all hardware produced in the future could have DRM in it. The very nature of GPL forbids DRM which will doom linux because it will hardware will be impossible to find
10:14	<xtknight>	CPrgmSwR2, let's go to #ubuntu-offtopic
10:14	<Buckminster>	anybody locked out of gnome after upgrading to feisty?
10:14	<DaMi3n>	teitunge, now while totem or vlc give me audio output mplayer stays mime
10:14	<teitunge>	ah, I see
10:14	<Journeyman>	oh wait I looked at the wrong error file
10:14	<DaMi3n>	Huffalump, thanks a loads
10:14	<kevinS2>	!LAMP >	kevins2
10:15	<Journeyman>	looks like it has issues with the sound and video drivers
10:15	<Journeyman>	but gdm loads fine
10:15	<Journeyman>	and I hear sound when it starts
10:15	<eck>	Buckminster: have you looked at ~/.xsession-errors?
10:15	<stpg>	how do i use special launcher? i cannot even install system.
10:15	<BIERCOFF>	icant update to 7.10 from my edgy
10:15	<BIERCOFF>	i think there is a problem with my sources.list
10:15	<teitunge>	BIERCOFF: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
10:15	<Journeyman>	Buckminster: I am having the same issue
10:15	<Buckminster>	eck: I/O error. seen a few posts on the forums and no solutions
10:15	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, who are you talking to and what is your problem?  Be descriptive on one line, not extra Enter keystrokes
10:15	<kevinS2>	what does this mean "httpd (no pid file) not running
10:15	<kevinS2>	"
10:15	<HYPOCRISY>	I'll think about it
10:15	<smo>	ahah keep edgy
10:15	<Huffalump>	+do
10:15	<BIERCOFF>	;)
10:16	<Huffalump>	:o
10:16	<teitunge>	I would also advice to keep edgy for a while - just untill the bugs are fixed.
10:16	<scarter>	doomster: after your next reboot, the bcm43xx module won't load, to unload it now, use --->	sudo rmmod bcm43xx  <--- in a terminal.
10:16	<eck>	Buckminster: i haven't heard of that one before
10:16	<BIERCOFF>	ok
10:16	<xtknight>	scarter, doomster: sudo modprobe -r bcm43xx
10:16	<xtknight>	is more reliable i think
10:16	<smo>	i ll go on feisty in 1 month or 2 not before
10:16	<Journeyman>	I get a displayconfig-restore: not found in .xsession-error
10:16	<eck>	kevinS2: it means you tried to stop httpd but ubuntu thinks it isn't running
10:16	<Buckminster>	eck: I'm gonna try a clean install, upgrading via synaptic usually buggers up something
10:16	<Huffalump>	BIERCOFF, for what it's worth, I also recommend waiting.
10:16	<scarter>	xtknight: correct, sorry doomster...
10:16	<aftermath>	How do I make a file writeable?
10:16	<teitunge>	totally agree smo, but I might install it on a laptop, just to help bug-testing
10:17	<BIERCOFF>	ok then
10:17	<BIERCOFF>	i'll wait
10:17	<teitunge>	if noone were bugtesting, evolution would stop :)
10:17	<billfur>	ubuntu is not detecting my drives.. any idea how to fix this?
10:17	<StoneNote>	BIERCOFF, fyi. 7.10 is Gusty and is not out yet. 7.04 is Feisty
10:17	<teitunge>	billfur: which drivers?
10:17	<Huffalump>	lol teitunge
10:17	<Elendir>	neither can i, says failed to fetch file:/usr/pluto/deb-cahce/./packages.gz file not found, is the server overloaded or something?
10:17	<smo>	thats what i made tietunge
10:17	<stpg>	is says something like faied to find valid screen mode. and in xorg.0.log was something like vesa mode not found. should i try older versions of ubuntu?

10:18	<aftermath>	hnn
10:18	<teitunge>	tyan s2696? sounds like asian plastic? is it an old one?
10:18	<Huffalump>	stpg, can you rephrase?  what video card do you have?  I've seen a number of problems (including one for myself)
10:18	<Horscht>	carlhempel, thanks again. firestarter did the trick :)
10:18	<billfur>	teitunge: the newer dual xeon motherboard.
10:18	<DaMi3n>	Huffalump, btw ... since i configured my sound preferences to use my USB audio card, while totem/vlc give me sound output, mplayer stays mime.. do you know any way to configure mplayer to use a different soundcard?
10:18	<kevinS2>	(98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 no listening sockets available, shutting down Unable to open logs , what is wrong?
10:18	<POVaddct>	kevinS2: and _how_ do you start apache?
10:18	<Huffalump>	Horscht, how you coming along? :)
10:18	<Journeyman>	man I don't see any errors
10:18	<Kraeloc>	impaque: still nothing
10:18	<Huffalump>	DaMi3n, sorry I do not.  I love my VLC.

10:18	<stpg>	i have ati radeon mobility x1600 on laptop asus A6Ja
10:18	<teitunge>	billfur: still sounds like asian plastic :P
10:18	<smo>	ps -aux | grep apache  then killl all apache id
10:18	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: you got to that wizard?
10:18	<kevinS2>	I write this in terminal: sudo /usr/sbin/apache2ctl start
10:18	<Kraeloc>	impaque: yeah
10:18	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: answered a bunch of questions? hm..
10:18	<billfur>	teitunge: if I boot normally with the install disk it gives a bios error 81 and a bunch of ata errors and dumps me at a terminal
10:19	<Huffalump>	stpg, okay, I'm not well versed in ATI, so someone else will have to help you.
10:19	<Kraeloc>	impaque: yep
10:19	<Elendir>	anyone get the error failed to fetch file:/usr/pluto/deb-cahce/./packages.gz file not found, when updating to 7.04?
10:19	<lino16>	i did a upgrade to feisty. but this error message show me: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/metacity-common_1%3a2.18.2-0ubuntu1_all.deb
10:19	<scarter>	xtknight: what's the diff between 'rmmod ...' and 'modprobe -r ....' ?
10:19	<teitunge>	billfur: auch, I really have no clue here :-/
10:19	<smo>	call me in pv stpg
10:19	<teitunge>	Good luck though!
10:19	<Horscht>	I am pretty happy now, Huffalump. Apart from the Ati Drivers problem, everything is running again.
10:19	<kevinS2>	I write this line in the terminal ' sudo /usr/sbin/apache2ctl start '
10:19	<billfur>	teitunge: definately going to need it =0
10:19	<xtknight>	scarter, not sure.  type "man rmmod"
10:19	<Horscht>	thanks to the helpful people in here
10:19	<teitunge>	I could try to help you :)
10:19	<POVaddct>	kevinS2: then some other process already uses tcp port 80. try to find it: sudo netstat --inet -nap | grep -w 80
10:19	<eck>	kevinS2: use the /etc/init.d script
10:19	<Huffalump>	Horscht, so you're just Beryl-disabled, but otherwise fine? :D
10:19	<soundray>	lino16: please run 'sudo apt-get -f install' and put the output on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
10:19	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: and what's the status now? your touchpad is still now working or it's even worse
10:19	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ?

10:19	<Horscht>	yes, Huffalump
10:20	<Elendir>	anyone get the error failed to fetch file:/usr/pluto/deb-cahce/./packages.gz file not found, when updating to 7.04?
10:20	<Journeyman>	grr
10:20	<billfur>	teitunge: but its just running rediculously slow of a bootup.. but it hasn't died yet =0
10:20	<OZStriker>	Hey!
10:20	<Kraeloc>	impaque: exactly the same as before
10:20	<Horscht>	either Beryl disabled or Movie disabled
10:20	<Kraeloc>	impaque: no left click, no trackpad
10:20	<Journeyman>	did anyone update feisty without problems?
10:20	<Huffalump>	Horscht, any luck in #ubuntu-effects ?  I know it's slower, but the help is often far far far better.
10:20	<teitunge>	argh
10:20	<teitunge>	hehe
10:20	<soundray>	Journeyman: yes
10:20	<OZStriker>	Is there any network Gurus?
10:20	<teitunge>	noacpi might be a good idea, yes!
10:20	<michael>	what do i name a script to make it executable?
10:20	<teitunge>	OZStriker: post your question, and we'll see
10:20	<smo>	Can help u Horscht
10:20	<Horscht>	does #ubuntu-effects help with driver issues?
10:20	<smo>	know beryl fine
10:20	<DaMi3n>	Horscht, do u also get the black video output.. with ATI on beryl?
10:20	<Horscht>	yes, DaMi3n
10:20	<eck>	michael: it doesn't matter what the name is, you just need to chmod it
10:20	<Horscht>	that's exactly my problem
10:20	<teitunge>	michael: the name doesnt matter: just chmod it
10:21	<teitunge>	don
10:21	<pavon>	michael - the name isn't important - you need to change the permisions with chmod
10:21	<DaMi3n>	Horscht, try using mplayer
10:21	<kevinS2>	Okey, ive done that i got this: tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     5362/apache

10:21	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: strange.. the only thing that comes to mind is have you put that laptop on standby? i'm asking that because my thinkpad sometimes goes numb when goes out of standby.. the track-"nipple" stops working
10:21	<lino16>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16894/ - apt-get -f install
10:21	<deebus>	anyone have any difficulties with beryl and fiesty?
10:21	<DaMi3n>	Horscht, it works for me except it doesnt use my working soundcard
10:21	<OZStriker>	I have two network cards. First is looking on local network, second - for ADSL. Why they can't work together?
10:21	<Journeyman>	anyone know what /dev/wacom is?
10:21	<Horscht>	mplayer tells me it couldn't open/initialize the Video_out device, DaMi3n
10:21	<pavon>	michael: you might want to but a #! line on top as well
10:21	<POVaddct>	kevinS2: there is already an apache process listening on port 80

10:22	<smo>	edit the /etc/network/interfaces <OZStriker>
10:22	<kevinS2>	Okej, but i try to run my .php files and it just download them not show them

10:22	<lino16>	soundray: ok
10:22	<smo>	or show it
10:22	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: and you're saying that it was working without any probs until you manually edited it?
10:22	<Kraeloc>	impaque: yeah
10:22	<deebus>	I installed beryl, but when I use it, my desktop goes black.  all except for the menu bar at the top, and maybe a window frame or two

10:22	<Huffalump>	deebus, for Beryl stuff, please join #ubuntu-effects
10:22	<jonah>	anyone knows why i can't turn my volume down?
10:22	<Kraeloc>	impaque: is this worth the effort of fixing, or should i just reinstall?
10:22	<Impaque>	Impaque: strange.. because dpkg-reconfigure does exactly that: it restores xorg.conf to the state it was in before you changed anything manually..
10:22	<deebus>	oh
10:22	<POVaddct>	kevinS2: thats another questtion. i cannot help you with that, i dont do web programming.
10:22	<deebus>	sorry dude
10:22	<deebus>	thx
10:22	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: (talking to myself..)
10:23	<Kraeloc>	impaque: yeah, i know
10:23	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ;)
10:23	<soundray>	lino16: you can probably fix this with 'sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/metacity-common_1%3a2.18.2-0ubuntu1_all.deb'. Run apt-get -f install again afterwards to see if it fixed it.
10:23	<smo>	kevinS2          sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
10:23	<Horscht>	DaMi3n, selecting a different video out driver gives choppy full-screen video playback
10:23	<smo>	or 4
10:23	<pavon>	in the "Software Sources" App what does a dash mean (as opposed to a check)?
10:23	<billy>	has the pressure on the servers dropped any?
10:23	<OZStriker>	eck: I mean that only one interface can be active. If I turn on another - first will go down
10:23	<cox377>	i'm having this issue when i'm trying to install the new ubuntu from cd, i select insta,, then when i select the drive i go /manual/drive i delete the current ntfs partition and  then select the new one, however when i go make the changes it says i havent selected a root, but i dont see any root optiomns
10:23	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: well, you can try moving xorg.conf to, say, xorg.conf.backup-again before you start dpkg-reconfigure (maybe it reads it)
10:23	<eck>	OZStriker: are you starting them with ifconfig?
10:23	<robdeman>	hey folks... is there any good reason to upgrade to Ubuntu 7 when running Server Edition with LAMP only?
10:23	<Kraeloc>	impaque: hmm
10:23	<Kraeloc>	i will try that
10:24	<robdeman>	Im now runnung 6.10 Server/LAMP
10:24	<OZStriker>	smo: What you mean - edit? There is everything fine there
10:24	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: to start clean, config-less, so to speak, but apart from that i have no other ideas :((
10:24	<billfur>	teitunge: apperently noacpi does not play well with smp
10:24	<smo>	what s your card Kraeloc?
10:24	<robdeman>	not sure why I would want to upgrade to 7
10:24	<jrsims>	hey, what's the name of the MS TrueType font package?
10:24	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, well thanks for trying
10:24	<Nergar>	hello fiestyseans!!
10:24	<Huffalump>	robdeman, I recommend you wait if you are running anything important at all
10:24	<smo>	what s the xact problem so OZstriker?
10:24	<soundray>	cox377: it means that you have to assign '/' as the mount point to one of your partitions.
10:24	<Kraeloc>	smo: radeon 9000, but video is not the problem
10:24	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: np :(
10:24	<eck>	OZStriker: check that one of them actually goes down with ifconfig, if not I think it is a routing problem and you can investigate with route
10:24	<cox377>	soundray: how do i go about douing that?
10:24	<Journeyman>	how can you get ubuntu to reconfigure xorg?
10:24	<lino16>	soundray: now this error message: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16896/
10:24	<Nergar>	anyone using a bcm43xx wifi card in feisty???
10:25	<soundray>	cox377: see for yourself -- just hit the slash (/) key where you are asked to enter the mount point.
10:25	<Huffalump>	lino16, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
10:25	<OZStriker>	eck: It's not going down with ifconfig. It's DNS problem I think
10:25	<eck>	OZStriker: you need to be careful with two ports because if your routes aren't set up right all the traffic will go overone card and not hte other
10:25	<Impaque>	bye peeps
10:25	<karim>	what is the runlevel of the singleuser mode ?
10:25	<soundray>	lino16: running sudo apt-get -f install once or twice will fix this
10:26	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
10:26	<Huffalump>	sorry lino16
10:26	<OZStriker>	eck: I can't make two default routes - but I need them
10:26	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: for DNS check the contents of /etc/resolv.conf
10:26	<eck>	OZStriker: you can change the metric with route if you need to
10:27	<zeer>	i play counter strike on wine
10:27	<eck>	OZStriker: so the LAN stuff has a lower metric than everything else, so that route will be used
10:27	<zeer>	but it is much slower than on edgy!
10:27	<Resister>	hi, I would like to watch online streaming video's in opera browser.. what do i have to install? i run ubuntu feisty fawn, opera 9.20
10:27	<zeer>	anyone knows why?...
10:27	<billy>	are desktop.iso seeders still in fairly high demand?
10:27	<zeer>	i'm using the default ubuntu fglrx driver
10:27	<Journeyman>	Huffalump: it says xserver-xorg is not installed
10:27	<kevinS1>	I get this error messange: httpd (no pid file) not running
10:27	<OZStriker>	POVaddct: I understand that? but once ADSL is connecting - it's rewriting resolv.conf file and killing DNS's of local-net iface
10:27	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, you have no X installed?
10:28	<Journeyman>	Huffalump: i do
10:28	<Journeyman>	i just upgraded to feisty
10:28	<OZStriker>	eck: I've tried that already and nothing was happened
10:28	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, then you have stumped me, because that is the command to reconfigure X
10:28	<Journeyman>	and I am locked out of gnome, I am pretty sure its an xorg.conf problem
10:28	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: look at the usepeerdns setting in your ppp/pppoe config and disable it
10:28	<jughead>	I just installed the Kubuntu 7.04 DVD and I have internet access through wireless but I cannot access my router (192.168.1.1) or even ping it.  How might I address this issue?
10:28	<Huffalump>	Journemany, if you like, you can:  (sudo) nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
10:28	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: so pppd will never change the resolv.conf file
10:28	<sc0tch>	Is there a FAQ/Howto on compiling a custom kernel on Feisty?

10:29	<OZStriker>	POVaddct: Ok. But the routing problem is still on
10:29	<lino16>	soundray: it runs correcty now. thanks. why must i three times apt-get -f install?

10:31	<piglit>	Fylk: when i name a logical volume / then it tel's me i cant use a / but only aphanumeric chars ect.
10:31	<Lobosque>	Fylk and how do i do it
10:31	<Huffalump>	eifzon, then keep asking and sorry I couldn't help
10:31	<dek>	I wanted to upgrade to Feisty, but my internet is going painfully slow (few kb/s), any ideas?
10:31	<Huffalump>	eifzon, Google?  good luck.
10:31	<OZStriker>	POVaddct: I've found nothing interesting there
10:31	<kevinS1>	Please can someone help me, i get this error message when i try to restart apache2, httpd (no pid file) not running
10:32	<eifzon>	np Huffalump :>
10:32	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: "nothing interesting" is a bit vague...
10:32	<Fylk>	piglit: once you've created the drive, there should be a drop down that lets you do that. I think they call it he mount point or some such.
10:32	<eck>	OZStriker: I still think that it is a routing issue (not DNS), you probably need to check the kernel routing table more closely
10:32	<smo>	just start it not restart kevinS1
10:32	<Fylk>	Lobosque: Click on places, my computer.
10:32	<Fylk>	Sorry, computer.
10:32	<piglit>	Fylk: thanx i'll take another look at it
10:33	<OZStriker>	eck: Both - routing and DNS problems actual here
10:33	<lino16>	ubuntu should integrate an paket-order for an better upgrade
10:33	<Lobosque>	Fylk it says that its unable to mount the selected drive
10:33	<kevinS1>	Okey no thats gone but know i get this, (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could notbind to address 0.0.0.0:80 no listening sockets available, shutting down Unable to open logs
10:33	<Fylk>	Lobosque: What are the mechines specs?
10:33	<scarter>	i've got a bcm4306 rev3 that i cannot get working under ndiswrapper. i used fwcutter to extract the files from a 3.100.64 dell version of the driver (i've got an hp r4000). although this works with bcm43xx (obviously, since i'm here), but not under ndiswrapper with the windows driver (64-bit driver on amd64). any ideas or thoughts?
10:33	<eck>	OZStriker: gross
10:33	<slicky>	is it possible to make my server use my printer here at home?  my server isn t in my local network..
10:34	<fade_>	is it possible to have both nvidia-glx and fglrx installed at once?
10:34	<Lobosque>	Fylk i`m in a athlon xp 1.5 512mb run Ubuntu 5.6 lts Live CD and a 80GB HD
10:34	<OZStriker>	eck: What you mean???
10:34	<eck>	OZStriker: you can't just connect through a router?
10:34	<kitche>	scarter: ndiswrapre doesn't support x86_64 drivers yet
10:34	<kitche>	ndiswrapper*
10:34	<Fylk>	Lobosque: Why in the gods names are you still using 5.6?
10:35	<Fylk>	And XP is your OS, ie not part of he machine.
10:35	<eck>	OZStriker: doesn't sound like my idea of fun ;-)
10:35	<Lobosque>	Fylk i mean 6.06
10:35	<OZStriker>	eck: :)
10:35	<Lobosque>	its the CD i have
10:35	<scarter>	kitche: thanks... does it do 32-bit drivers on amd64?
10:35	<kitche>	scarter: not sure
10:35	<OZStriker>	eck: Do you know how to make KNetworkManager work with two interfaces at the same time? Cuz it's working only with one interface.........
10:35	<Lobosque>	Fylk i remember that i must type something to mount the fat32 drive
10:35	<fuoco>	is there some kind of file sharing with zeroconf solution ?
10:35	<Lobosque>	i made it some years ago
10:36	<AaronMT>	hmm flash still locks up firefox sometimes (youtube)
10:36	<fade_>	scarter: it's easier to install the packages from here http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/ than to mess with fwcutter
10:36	<Fylk>	Lobosque: Ok, that's a little better. So, when you go to the computer, it gives you the error.....shouldn't have too. fat32 is universally supported.
10:36	<kevinS3>	Ive got this messange when i start apache, (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 no listening sockets available, shutting down Unable to open logs
10:36	<dek>	I wanted to upgrade to Feisty, but my internet is going painfully slow (few kb/s). In Windows it works just fine, any ideas?
10:36	<sebus07>	jest tu kto z polski ??
10:36	<fade_>	kevinS3: something is already listening on port 80
10:37	<kevinS3>	How do i kill it on port 80, and can i look what it is
10:37	<eck>	OZStriker: I am a gnome user, so I'm not really sure, but I have used NM with two cards at once in the past
10:37	<fade_>	kevinS3: "netstat -nap" will give you a list of all open ports and the PIDs
10:37	<smo>	how can i list all available users from terminal?
10:38	<soundray>	smo: cat /etc/passwd
10:38	<fade_>	users are listed in /etc/passwd
10:38	<POVaddct>	smo: cat /etc&passwd
10:38	<POVaddct>	smo: cat /etc/passwd
10:38	<kevinS3>	Is it possible to just look whats on port 80?
10:38	<surviver>	smo, type users
10:38	<fade_>	regluar users have UIDs starting from 1000 on a Deb/Ubuntu system
10:38	<OZStriker>	eck: At 6.10 - everything was fine and both interfaces was woring at the same time. But after upgrading to 7.04......something was happened
10:38	<Stig>	Hi. I am new to Ubuntu and I am trying to add a folder to my usr folder, but it is saying "You do not have permissions to write to this folder." Does this mean I need to be logged in as root? If so, how do I login as root to do this?!
10:38	<smo>	yeah strange thing with users
10:38	<fade_>	kevinS3:  pipe it through grep then
10:38	<smo>	i have my username 6/7 times...
10:38	<POVaddct>	kevinS3: i already told you how to do this, you didnt listen
10:38	<OZStriker>	eck: And it's not more working and I don't like that
10:38	<smo>	smo smo smos smo smo smo smo
10:38	<kevinS3>	im kind of new so
10:38	<smo>	....
10:38	<Fylk>	Wait a tik.....Why in hells bells would some one format a drive to fat32?
10:38	<smo>	strange
10:39	<surviver>	smo, lol bug?
10:39	<kevinS3>	Yes PO but i didnt helP?
10:39	<eck>	kevinS3: lsof -i | grep LISTEN
10:39	<ffm>	kevinS3: in your webbrowser type localhost:80
10:39	<smo>	maye running from usb key with persistent mode
10:39	<soundray>	Stig: please don't create a folder in /usr/ as user. You should only write to your $HOME directory
10:39	<smo>	think it s linked...
10:39	<ffm>	Hi, how can I get my FTP to work? It dosnt seem to be working righ now.
10:39	<surviver>	ffm, type in console ftp
10:39	<cotton>	Whats xclient and why is it in my sessions menu?
10:39	<fade_>	Stig: sudo bash
10:39	<soundray>	Stig: if for some reason you need to install some program in /usr, put it in /usr/local
10:39	<fade_>	Stig: although I can't see *why* you need to create a new folder in /usr
10:39	<surviver>	ffm, e.g    ftp ftp.xxx.xx
10:40	<POVaddct>	kevinS3: netstat printed out a process id. so you got the information you wanted.
10:40	<kitche>	cotton: it's part of X there is xserver and xclient
10:40	<raboof>	kevinS3: "netstat -pan | grep 80" as root, last column shows pid and program name
10:40	<Stig>	it's actually in usr >	share >	cairo-clock, I just want to add a theme for it...
10:40	<soundray>	fade_: please don't recommend sudo bash, as you end up with mixed environment variable sets.
10:40	<eck>	OZStriker: if you figure out what changed, make sure to file a bug report
10:40	<POVaddct>	kevinS3: if you cannot make sense of the output of netstat, maybe you shouldn't run a server.
10:40	<fade_>	I wouldn't recommend creating folders in /usr either :-)
10:40	<scarter>	fade_: i did try those, but they didn't work... did some searching and found users that had luck with the a dell package and i used that with fwcutter and bcm43xx with success. just would like full 54g support instead of 11mb.
10:40	<cotton>	kitche: Whats happends when I load it?
10:40	<kitche>	cotton: no idea
10:40	<soundray>	Stig: if you use 'sudo mkdir /usr/newdirectory', it will work, but like I say, it's not recommended
10:40	<tim167>	hi, is there a way to dial phone numbers from my address book using a dialup modem? how ? thanks!
10:41	<OZStriker>	eck: Good words : ".....if I'll figure out...."..... :(
10:41	<Skiguy>	is there any program in feisty that might be listening to 6880 other than azureus that might be preventing it from starting up?
10:41	<Stig>	Im not trying to create a new folder. I am trying to move a folder containing themes for cairo-clock into the cairo-clock folder.
10:41	<fade_>	scarter: have you tried altering the rate using iwconfig?
10:41	<Lobosque>	Fylk is something like mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /media/A
10:41	<mau>	Typically, I want "direct rendering" on my video card, right?
10:41	<surviver>	stig, use mv command?
10:41	<Nergar>	i need help with my Broadcom Corporation BCM4318. it turns off after a while. installed a deb package to make it work after fresh feisty install
10:41	<raboof>	Skiguy: 'netstat -pan | grep 6880' as root ;)
10:41	<OZStriker>	eck: I'm really confused after that few days of fighting with that problem
10:41	<muxx>	Stig: you can install themes in your home directory, in .cairo-clock/themes
10:41	<soundray>	Stig: 'sudo mv /source/dir /target/dir'
10:42	<fade_>	Skiguy: sudo netstat -nap | fgrep 6880
10:42	<Fylk>	Maybe. I don't OWN anything that
10:42	<soundray>	Stig: but listen to muxx
10:42	<livingdaylight>	!cnr
10:42	<scarter>	fade_: i googling and found mention of using ndiswrapper v1.1 instead of 1.2 and >.  any thoughts?
10:42	<ffm>	surviver: Oooh. Thanks
10:42	<Fylk>	fat32 any more.
10:42	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about cnr - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
10:42	<FernLujan>	hey guys
10:42	<surviver>	ffm, yw
10:42	<FernLujan>	is there a task manager in ubuntu?
10:42	<sanityx>	Anybody know what the low latency kernel does?
10:42	<OZStriker>	eck: I have no such type of problems in Gentoo........
10:42	<Stig>	ok thanks
10:42	<Fylk>	Yes fern.
10:42	<livingdaylight>	anyone know about CNR?
10:42	<livingdaylight>	!CNR
10:42	<scarter>	fade_: i've read that the bcm43xx is limited to 11mb... is that untrue?
10:42	<FernLujan>	FYlk: how do I access it?
10:42	<fade_>	never bothered with ndiswrapper - not interested in running the Windows driver
10:42	<soundray>	sanityx: it lowers the latency of course
10:42	<cotton>	Were do I download liquidweather?
10:42	<sanityx>	soundray, ok what does that mean
10:42	<ardchoille>	FernLujan: gnome-system-monitor
10:42	<eck>	OZStriker: can you not just copying the routing/dns settings from gentoo and use them in ubuntu?
10:42	<sanityx>	latency of what?
10:42	<kitche>	livingdaylight: what do you want to know?
10:42	<fade_>	scarter: maybe 12 months ago
10:43	<FernLujan>	ardchoille: thanks
10:43	<ffm>	cotton: in a terminal type sudo apt-get install liquidweather
10:43	<n2diy>	livingdaylight: that is a Lindows/Freespire thing
10:43	<livingdaylight>	kitche, where it is?
10:43	<Fylk>	Fern: System->Adiminstration->	System Monitor.
10:43	<tim167>	can i dial phonenumbers with my dialup modem from ubuntu ?
10:43	<soundray>	sanityx: it means that it will respond within a shorter time, which can be important for signal processing.
10:43	<OZStriker>	eck: No.....Cuz Ubuntu file structure is diiferent from Gentoo......Too different.......
10:43	<cotton>	thanks ffm, does it work in gnome?
10:43	<sanityx>	soundray, why would you ever NOT want a low latency kernel?
10:43	<Stig>	I dont see the cairo-clock folder in my home folder :(
10:43	<ardchoille>	FernLujan: I believe it's in the menu: System ->	Administration ->	Gnome System Monitor ?
10:43	<kitche>	livingdaylight: hmm not sure check System might be clink n run in the menu
10:43	<scarter>	fade_: like i said, the bcm43xx is working... didn't really want windows drivers either. maybe i'll live with it, it supports wep, wpa, wpa2... so anyway, thanks.
10:43	<randomwalker>	how do i make sudo remember my password for a longer period of time?
10:43	<randomwalker>	it seems to forget it every 5 minutes or so
10:43	<soundray>	sanityx: there are some penalties associated
10:43	<madp3ngu1n>	sup guys
10:43	<livingdaylight>	kitche, i was actually looking for webilder and it isn't in synaptic so i wondered if it might be in the famous new Ubuntu acquisition CNR
10:43	<DanRaider>	what is the default su password, i didnt get a chance so set it when i intsalled 7,04
10:43	<surviver>	randomwalker, u can try to set up a script...
10:43	<sanityx>	sanityx, such as? or is there a place I can learn more?
10:44	<ffm>	cotton: Yes. Also, you can go to Applications>Add/Remove and then type the name in the search box
10:44	<madp3ngu1n>	can anyone help me with this?
10:44	<Cosmo_>	I got the drivers for my printer installed and it shows up, but whenever I try to print anything my printer shows reciving data but nothing ever prints (the printer is a brother 1840C and I am running 7.04) anyone know how to fix this?
10:44	<fuoco>	is there some kind of file sharing with zeroconf solution ?
10:44	<soundray>	sanityx: but I'm not enough of an expert to give you a precise answer.
10:44	<madp3ngu1n>	 Application x-mplayer2
10:44	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: let's say gentoo's file structure is very different from other linux distros..
10:44	<eck>	OZStriker: but it is just resolv.conf and the stuff in route that you need to fix, right?
10:44	<sanityx>	soundray, ah ok. Well thanks for sharing what you know :-D
10:44	<Huffalump>	!ask | madp3ngu1n
10:44	<eck>	13:41:22 <       eck>	OZStriker: but it is just resolv.conf and the stuff in route that you need to fix, right?
10:44	<ubotu>	madp3ngu1n: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
10:44	<randomwalker>	surviver: i can write scripts. what would the script do?
10:44	<eck>	sorry
10:44	<fade_>	scarter: just try: iwconfig <device>	rate 54M
10:44	<madp3ngu1n>	i just did
10:44	<bXi>	POVaddct: how so?
10:44	<scottder_>	Hey all....are there any repsoitories out there with newer versions of snort for ubuntu
10:44	<maxter>	ubuntu en Espaol donode?
10:44	<Tarkus>	hey, im a windows user, and my vista OS crashed, so i tried installing linux a few days ago, and i love it, so far i find no reason to switch back besides the fact that the software i use (3DStudio Max, Sonar, Adobe Products) doesnt support linux. i know blender is a very good open-source 3d modeling/rendering package, but as far as adobe stuff, is there a dreamweaver alternative? and illustrator/photoshop?
10:44	<cotton>	ffm: E: Couldn't find package liquidweather
10:44	<maxter>	ubuntu en Espaol donode?
10:44	<scottder_>	the on offered in universe is OLD
10:44	<jintxo>	maxter, /join #ubuntu-es ?
10:44	<POVaddct>	bXi: the boot scripts of gentoo for example
10:44	<ffm>	cotton:  Then use synaptic.
10:44	<OZStriker>	eck: Also that have no sens, cuz the resolv.conf and other settings is a copy with Gentoo
10:44	<madp3ngu1n>	whats with this error  Application x-mplayer2
10:44	<Huffalump>	madp3ngu1n, that wasn't really a question.  What problem are you having?
10:44	<maxter>	gracias
10:45	<jintxo>	de nada
10:45	<Horscht>	how can I set the default application for Videos to mplayer?
10:45	<livingdaylight>	kitche, you see 'click n run' in your System soemwhere?
10:45	<surviver>	randomwalker, try to fix eg when u press f12 he loads ur password, or set it up when he ask password the answer is 'ur password'
10:45	<sanityx>	Tarkus, There's Nvu, also Eclipse might have a web development pluigin
10:45	<bXi>	POVaddct: ubuntu has the init.d scripts
10:45	<mau>	Tarkus: Check out Gimp, Nvu, Inkscape.
10:45	<sanityx>	plugin*
10:45	<ardchoille>	!default
10:45	<ubotu>	To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties ->	Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror ->	Settings ->	Configure and then hit "File Associations"
10:45	<kitche>	livingdaylight: don't use ubuntu
10:45	<sanityx>	Nvu is no dreamweaver though
10:45	<bXi>	it lacks rc-status/rc-update tho
10:45	<jonah>	Compiz or Beryl?
10:45	<POVaddct>	bXi: yes, that is more standard that gentoo
10:45	<soundray>	sanityx: there's one thing that I can say for sure: the low-latency kernels scheduler is more complex and less well-tested than the scheduler that the regular kernel uses.
10:45	<livingdaylight>	kitche, :o
10:45	<OZStriker>	eck: Hmmmm.....As I see (K)Ubuntu is pretty simple system, but maybe not for me............
10:45	<fade_>	scarter:if it does work, then you can add it to /etc/network/interfaces to make it default
10:45	<Tarkus>	mau, sanityx: k, thanks guys.
10:45	<abom>	anyone here tha can help me get my wireless internet to work in ubuntu?
10:45	<surviver>	randomwalker, i know it is possible but dont ask me how iam not really into scripts :p
10:45	<tim167>	how can i use an old dialup modem in ubuntu ?
10:45	<kevinS2>	!LAMP >	kevin2
10:45	<abom>	I'm on ubuntu with a wired connection, but my wireless won't work
10:46	<ffm>	cotton: Uhh, to use liquidweather, you need to be using  superkaramba and KDE.
10:46	<livingdaylight>	kitche, pray, what are you doing in #ubuntu?
10:46	<POVaddct>	bXi: /etc/init.d and /etc/rc<N>.d is system V like
=== abom is now known as Abom
10:46	<Huffalump>	Tarkus, for Adobe, do you mean Photoshop?  Not much can replace that, but you can --with some effort-- get that to work under WINE
10:46	<livingdaylight>	kitche, kubuntu?
10:46	<fade_>	tim167: depends if it's a proper modem, of a software/winmodem
10:46	<jintxo>	guys, I'm having a small fight with update-grub script. I add lines like "#kopt_2_6=root=/dev/hda1 ro" in the correct line in menu.lst; then I run update-grub and it deletes the #kopt line I put in and just re-creates boot entries with whatever defaults it gets from i-don't-know-where. is that the way it's suposed to work?
10:46	<bXi>	the init.d scripts are symlinks to the rc.* scripts tho
10:46	<kevinS2>	!LAMP >	kevins2
10:46	<bXi>	from what i remember
10:46	<asc>	Could somebody suggest a good video converter?
10:46	<tim167>	fade_: it's a winows modem
10:46	<soundray>	tim167: configure it via System-Preferences-Network - there should be a "Modem connection" item
10:46	<OZStriker>	Ok. Thank you, Guys! Sorry that I've wasted your time :(
10:46	<bXi>	havent played with ubuntu in a while
10:47	<kitche>	livingdaylight: in the process of either going fBSD or making my own linux system
10:47	<dunstabulos>	asc: vlc?
10:47	<POVaddct>	bXi: no, the other way round. entries in /etc/rc.*/ are symlink to scripts in /etc/init.d
10:47	<livingdaylight>	Since joining forces with Linspire, Ubuntu is supposed to have CNR now. Anyone help me with that?
10:47	<SoR>	Abom: what wireless card do you have?
10:47	<bXi>	ah
10:47	<fade_>	tim167: all the functionality is in the software then, which means you'll need to find a driver - I can't help you beyond that, I've always made sure I bought proper modems
10:47	<jintxo>	I've read the script and I have to be missing something because it's not doing that I think it should be doing by reading it...
10:47	<ffm>	!cnr
10:47	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about cnr - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
10:47	<soundray>	tim167: listen to fade_ though -- external serial modems are easy, but winmodems are jinxed
10:47	<Abom>	I have a belkin f5d7000 I think it's called
10:47	<bXi>	all my current ubuntu box do is load nxclient which connects to a faster gentoo box :P
10:48	<livingdaylight>	kitche, reinventing the wheel? or just so fun you can't help yourself? either way good luck - Enjoy
10:48	<asc>	dunstabulos: Never gotten it to work, but I suppose it's worth another try.
10:48	<POVaddct>	bXi: hehe
10:48	<livingdaylight>	ffm, i tried that already
10:48	<PriceChild>	livingdaylight, You mis understand. They are making CNR for use ubuntu. we're not working with them afaik. Go ask them :)
10:48	<Abom>	sor: my wireless card is working but I can't connect to my router
10:48	<bXi>	a 700mhz laptop with 64mb ram vs a dual xeon 3ghz with 4gb of ram
10:48	<bXi>	easy choice :p
10:48	<soundray>	Abom: Belkin used three different chipsets under that model name over the years
10:48	<zaggynl>	Isn't k9copy in feisty anymore? I enabled every repo in synaptic, but it won't show up :*
10:48	<fade_>	to,167: possibly more info here: http://www.linmodems.org/
10:48	<redondos>	Good afternoon. While trying to dist-upgrade to feisty, I get an error I can't understand: "package uses Breaks; not supported in this dpkg". What might this be about? Complete log in http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16912/
10:49	<zaggynl>	!k9copy
10:49	<ubotu>	For playing DVD, see http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/video.html - "libdvdcss2" can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages - Try k9copy (available in !Universe) for backing up DVDs

10:49	<Abom>	sor: no encryptions

10:50	<redondos>	fade_: What's update-manager? :)
10:50	<ardchoille>	zaggynl: Did you do click the update button in Synaptic after enabling more repos?
10:50	<livingdaylight>	PriceChild, what users? :s
10:50	<_kaidaikonquerer>	I got banned from a channel on here Kubuntu, It had something to do w/ my nick name, how can I get back in
10:50	<zaggynl>	ardchoille, yep

10:50	<cotton>	It's ok
10:50	<fade_uk>	redondos: running gnome?

10:50	<_kaidaikonquerer>	ffm: I did, it say Im banned its been like a few days
10:51	<ardchoille>	zaggynl: That could be the reason
10:51	<redondos>	fade_uk: Yeah, I will try with update-manager, thank you.

10:51	<cotton>	Were can I control LAMP in ubuntu 7.04?
10:51	<ffm>	WHAT PORT do I need to open for people to be able to send mail to my computer's mailserver??????????
10:51	<fade_uk>	redondos: then system->administration->update manager
10:51	<livingdaylight>	kitche, i thought i heard that it was gonna be done for ubuntu and ubuntu was gonna do something for linspire

10:51	<Jimbo99>	hey guys, i have had an issue with how smb works for some time now.  What I want to do with smb is to browse to a network computer using nautilus.  then find a share and folder, then open that and have it mount as if it is a folder on my system--similar to the way you mount another local drive--it becomes a folder in the file system.  I absolutely detest the way smb seems to work where it doesn't actually mount but creates a stream to 
10:51	<erUSUL>	ffm: 25
10:51	<redondos>	fade_uk: It should work with apt-get/aptitude but I won't rely on it.
10:51	<Cafe_>	how can i generate an ISO image of an cd/dvd?
10:51	<ffm>	thank,s erUSUL, fade_uk
10:51	<Abom>	sor: I'm online with an ethernet cable right now though, so I am in ubuntu (7.04 btw)
10:51	<ardchoille>	Cafe_: mkisofs
10:52	<fade_uk>	to be fair I did it during pre-release with aptitude and it took me a while to get everything sorted
10:52	<cotton>	Were us LAMP in 7.04?
10:52	<khvn>	hey
10:52	<_kaidaikonquerer>	is there anything I can do? How do I register my nick?
10:52	<Abom>	sor: I also couldn't get the wirless to work in 6... and I tried wi-fi radar also, got the same thing, said I was connected but nothing
10:52	<tbuss>	Jimbo99: don't know if this helps but I started using ssh instead of smb
10:52	<Huffalump>	cotton, can you rephrase that question?
10:52	<soundray>	Abom: no, they are part of the kernel, but get loaded dynamically. Check if you have a module called rt2570 by running 'lsmod | grep rt2570'

10:52	<ardchoille>	!lamp | cotton
10:52	<ubotu>	cotton: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
10:52	<fade_uk>	from memory the release notes said something about using update-manager for problem-free upgrading
10:52	<Jimbo99>	tbuss:  thanks but no ssh plz
10:52	<latoo>	Any suggestions why Rhythmbox wouldn't see a DAAP share if avahi is running and the service is visible with discovery?
10:52	<cotton>	I know what it is, but were can I control LAMP
10:52	<khvn>	need help
10:52	<Abom>	soundray:  thanks
10:52	<soundray>	Abom: if there is output from that, it means that it's loaded.
10:53	<khvn>	just upgraded from xubuntu edgy to feisty
10:53	<SoR>	Abom: and under some different system you can connect?
10:53	<Huffalump>	cotton, follow the link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
10:53	<khvn>	it also updated linux kernel
10:53	<ardchoille>	cotton: That page has some suggestions for gui's
10:53	<AaronMT>	!emerald
10:53	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about emerald - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
10:53	<fade_uk>	so again, anybody know if it's possible to install the binary drivers for both ATI and Nvidia at the same time? the pacakge conflict with each other
10:53	<khvn>	the -386 one doesn't work
10:53	<khvn>	the -generic one works
10:53	<ffm>	!botabuse >	AaronMT
10:53	<Jimbo99>	doing it the way they seem to do it is almost ludicrous.  i simply want to mount the shares.
10:53	<khvn>	it also trashed my nvidia drivers which I installed with envy
10:53	<Cafe_>	i tried point mkisofs to the mount point of my cd. it created an image. but is that image an copy of the files? or is it identical as the cd? (bootable)
10:53	<ardchoille>	fade_uk: Of course they conflict. Why would one need both?
10:53	<Journeyman>	how do you down grade back to edgy?
10:53	<fade_uk>	cos I've got two graphics cards
10:54	<tbuss>	fiesty upgrade is stuck at 77% "Gathering information for installation report.." Should I reboot and try again.
10:54	<khvn>	i had to change xorg.conf from 'nvidia' to 'nv'
10:54	<fade_uk>	one is Ati and the other is Nvidia
10:54	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, good luck
10:54	<artee>	Cafe_, dd if=/dev/cdrom of=cd.iso?
10:54	<khvn>	i want my nvidia drivers back!
10:54	<mandarkeX>	is there a command that will show you your KERNELPATH?
10:54	<Journeyman>	oh good
10:54	<Journeyman>	well
10:54	<Abom>	SoR: I can connect fine in windows with its automatic wirless thingy
10:54	<khvn>	envy doesn't work because it can't install linux headers
10:54	<jintxo>	Cafe_, if you want to make an identical copy of a cd (an image) and not just an image of the files it contains, it's probably best to use something like "dd"
10:54	<Cafe_>	artee, i think so!!
10:54	<Abom>	soundray: I typed what you said and nothing came back, so that means I don't have it right? how do i install it with the synaptic pack manager?
10:54	<artee>	Cafe_, ok :-)
10:54	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - I havent tried to do what you are doing but I see no reason why they should conflict...
10:54	<latoo>	Anyone know what Rhythmbox requires to see a DAAP share?
10:55	<z3r0ph3wl>	hello room ;)
10:55	<Cafe_>	cheers guys
10:55	<Huffalump>	z3r0ph3wl, just ask away, no need for formalities
10:55	<erUSUL>	latoo: maybe you need to configure/install some plug in...
10:55	<soundray>	Abom: it means that you don't have it, but it also means that your card is probably supported by another module. How is your card connected - PCI or USB?
10:55	<Abom>	soundray: PCI
10:55	<latoo>	erUSUL: Rhythmbox supports DAAP natively since Edgy at least
10:55	<gonzzor>	Does anyone know what this means "Error: state recovery failed on NFSv4 server 192.168.0.1 with error 121" My kernel logs are flodded with this when I try to read from a file on a nfsv4 mount fs?
10:56	<[1] ircusr>	hi all
10:56	<fade_uk>	ajehuk: that's what I thought
10:56	<soundray>	Abom: can you put the output of lspci on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and give me the link please
10:56	<jintxo>	is update-grub script supposed to overwrite manually introduced #kopt_2_6=foo entries in  menu.lst?
10:56	<fade_uk>	I might just try force-installing with dpkg
10:56	<Huffalump>	[1] ircusr, just ask away, no need for formalities
10:56	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - have you come accross a problem? Oh and you are presumably going to need to use xinerama for your multi-monitor support so I think that will reduce the utility of using the binary drivers...
10:56	<Abom>	soundray: the output?
10:56	<cotton>	On my computer, there is really no valuble file, but on other computer on my network there are extramly valuble files. Is there a chance of comeone hacking in and getting these files?
10:56	<PyroMithrandir>	anybody here know how to add a border around TTY1-6 consoles with .bash_profile?
10:56	<cotton>	*valuable

10:57	<[1] ircusr>	does sound work on feisty?
10:57	<fade_uk>	ajehuk: well I've got a tri-head setup at the moment, single port Ati AGP card, dual port nvidia PCI card
10:57	<soundray>	Abom: open a terminal window, run lspci, copy the output (text that the command produces) and paste it on that site
10:57	<surviver>	jrib, hy u there?
10:57	<[1] ircusr>	i tried feisty beta
10:57	<[1] ircusr>	and sound wasnt working
10:57	<Huffalump>	cotton, that's a tough question to answer.  It's harder on Ubuntu than on Windows, if that's what you mean.
10:57	<jrib>	surviver: yes
10:57	<jrsims>	help! I installed beryl in xubuntu, and now when beryl is turned off, I have no window borders! WTF?
10:57	<ffm>	[1] ircusr: Of cource.
10:57	<danlock2>	[1] ircusr it work here
10:57	<[1] ircusr>	ok
10:57	<fade_uk>	ajehuk: performance is pretty lousy though with X using up 100% of one of the CPUs most of the time
10:57	<ffm>	jrsims: Try #xubuntu or #ubuntu-effects.
10:57	<khvn>	just upgraded from xubuntu edgy to feisty, it also updated linux kernel. the -386 one doesn't work, the -generic one works. it also trashed my nvidia drivers which I installed with envy. i had to change xorg.conf from 'nvidia' to 'nv'. i want my nvidia drivers back!  envy doesn't work because it can't install linux headers. apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy (i have a geforce2) doesn't work too - it can't remove old nvidia-glx for some reason.
10:57	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - Im tri-head here too,
10:57	<Huffalump>	[1] ircusr, be specific.  It works for most, but not for some.  You have to share details
10:57	<jrsims>	ffm: k
10:57	<ajehuk>	fade_uk no binary drivers and minimal CPU usage
10:57	<[1] ircusr>	can i run the latest rts games on feisty?
10:57	<surviver>	jrib, if u remember me :) i had some probs yesterday but now its back fine, got little question is there a command or sonthing to recover ubuntu or an os
10:57	<[1] ircusr>	i mean, cnc3, supcom
10:58	<muxx>	latoo, did you upgrade from edgy or earlier?
10:58	<PyroMithrandir>	!wine
10:58	<ubotu>	wine is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information.
10:58	<latoo>	[1] ircusr: it varies
10:58	<Huffalump>	[1] ircusr, that depends on the game
10:58	<latoo>	muxx: no, fresh feisty install
10:58	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - thats with a Ati radeon 9950 and a 8 year old matrox card with 4mb memory
10:58	<cotton>	Huffalump: Have you ever herd on this happening and valuable files being hacked
10:58	<Huffalump>	[1] ircusr, I read that CNC3 works, but I have no first hand experience
10:58	<fade_uk>	ajehuk: I've got to use the nvidia binary driver to get the second port working
10:58	<[1] ircusr>	ah
10:58	<Huffalump>	cotton, no
10:58	<patrick_>	i just installed the nvidia drivers using envy, but it messed up and now it says no monitor found when it tried to load gdm
10:58	<_kaidaikonquerer>	is there any way to get back to a channel you been banned from
10:58	<Gunrun>	guys I really need help. I am at step 7 of the install process, and it has asked me nothing about dual booting
10:58	<redondos>	Can you please tell me what this error mean? "package uses Breaks; not supported in this dpkg": http://www.pastebin.ca/451805
10:58	<atlantia>	so my laptop: upgrade went well. GF's laptop, nvidia drivers are barfing on xorg loading. They keep flashing the logo and then it locks. I have to reboot in recover to change xorg back to nv. I am going to try manually installing them from nvidia, as envy is failing me, any advice?
10:58	<Gunrun>	:(
10:58	<jrib>	surviver: recover from what?
10:58	<surviver>	jrib, like when it crashes can i fix it by typing sonthing like : fix -d ... or sonthing like that so it restores himself or sonthing
10:58	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - are you sure? Idont on the ati side...
10:58	<latoo>	muxx: avahi-daemon is running and I can browse the itunes share with the service discovery but Rhythmbox just won't see it
10:59	<redondos>	fade_uk: By the way, update-manager wants me to fix broken packages first. And they can't be fixed due to this error.
10:59	<jrib>	surviver: there's no command that covers everything.  What is wrong?
10:59	<NemesisD>	alright there we go
10:59	<Abom>	soundray: here we go: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16915/
10:59	<danlock2>	Gunrun... did you set it up to install in another partiton
10:59	<fade_uk>	ajehuk: I wasn't able to get the nv card to detect the second port, it doesn't appear in lspci either
10:59	<NemesisD>	i installed realplay and I'm trying to play an RMVB file but it's playing all herky-jerky, could anyone help me fix this?
10:59	<surviver>	jrib, i accidently deleted some importend files so i needed them to recover due to this live cd i could fix it but i didnt knwo a command

11:03	<ffm>	What would be the best PCI wireless card if I plan  to use the card as a USB hotspot (I want my computer to act as a wireless router)?
11:03	<fade_uk>	I'm not really after the effects, just suspect that the compositing may improve performance
11:03	<Stonekeeper>	should i use ndis for bcm43xx?
11:03	<Abom>	soundray: can you tell for sure that it's my wireless card not working? I mean, it says it's working doesn't it?  I thought it might be a setting on my router that was only allowing windows systems in or something, I dunno
11:03	<matkix0s>	What do i need to do to play AVI's?
11:03	<fade_uk>	less window redraws and all that
11:03	<matkix0s>	And Dvix?
11:03	<Gunrun>	 I am trying to install ubuntu, and I am at step 7, and nothing has come up about dual booting yet, can anyone help?
11:03	<eztk>	dang
11:03	<eztk>	missed huffalump again :|
11:03	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: I don't believe it is
11:03	<patrick_>	i just installed the nvidia drivers using envy, but it messed up and now it says no monitor found when it tried to load gdm, what do i do im stuck in termianl
11:03	<Gunrun>	(step 7 is the final step)
11:04	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - just one thing - the CPU usage you are seeing is a bit strange - what process is making use of it?
11:04	<muxx>	latoo: it could be related. I don't really know about this as I don't need daap functionality
11:04	<Stonekeeper>	matkix0s: try opening it (feisty) and it should install codecs, Or install vlc
11:04	<Abom>	soundray: I'm online, so I can vnc, but I'm waiting for my friend to get on so he can tak control of my comp and assess it like that :)
11:04	<clement_>	g
11:04	<dandaman32>	Gunrun: choose "go back" button before GRUB installation, then select install GRUB from menu and tell it not to install to MBR
11:04	<Stonekeeper>	fade_uk: you dont believe it's limited? it's because I'm using G only on my router but speed is capped to 11mbs. I'm sat next to it
11:04	<|thunder>	so, i cant seem to find the feisty wiki. Im having trouble upgrading to latest nvidia driver.
11:04	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: I'm using the bcm43xx driver with firmware from cafuego, and I think I've got a 54M connection
11:04	<deserteagle>	could someone please explain to me why if i use the stock "nv" driver 1920x1200@60Hz looks normal, but trying to use "nvidia" drivers causes the monitor to look like crap?
11:04	<latoo>	muxx: do you use avahi though?
11:04	<ardchoille>	I like how Feisty gives you a message in the terminal when you try to launch an app you don't have installed
11:05	<muxx>	latoo: actually, as I just checked, avahi-daemon fails to start on my box, with msg "avahi-daemon disabled because there is a unicast .local domain"
11:05	<Gunrun>	I didn't see anything about grub dandaman32
11:05	<muxx>	oh well
11:05	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: tried using iwconfig to alter the setting?
11:05	<soundray>	Abom: routers can't distinguish Linux from Windows systems while they try to connect. Your problem is most likely firmware.
11:05	<fade_uk>	ajehuk: Xorg
11:05	<latoo>	muxx: hrm, where you do see that? "avahi-daemon start"?
11:05	<|thunder>	deserteagle; because feisty uses an ancient nvidia driver
11:05	<xMorgawr>	guys, if anybody uses or programs with gtk 2.0, what's the difference with "gtk_button_new_with_label" and "gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic"?
11:05	<muxx>	latoo: yes
11:05	<Abom>	soundray: o ok, damn hehe
11:06	<vincent>	hi
11:06	<ajehuk>	fade_uk hmm - strange, - but without access to the same config I wont comment :)
11:06	<Stonekeeper>	fade_uk: oh no, how do i do that?
11:06	<deserteagle>	so if its ancient, why does it work better than the "newer"nvidia drivers?
11:06	<NemesisD>	nm fixd!
11:06	<soundray>	Abom: I know precisely this kind of trouble, my wife has it with her laptop -- it has a rt61-supported PCI card, too
11:06	<surviver>	jrib, well u helped me a lot last days :p :) thx for that :)
11:06	<livingdaylight>	is python 2.5.1 the latest?
11:06	<dandaman32>	Gunrun: oops i was thinking textmode installer
11:06	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: to be honest I've never tested it properly, but I can set it to 54M, and I'm pretty sure that I've read that it's supported in the changelog
11:06	<Stonekeeper>	also the dhcp is flaky but im assuming thats my cheapo router
11:06	<jrib>	surviver: k, installing wine is easy though right?
11:06	<deserteagle>	i can't get the nvidia drivers to work at all
11:06	<Abom>	soundray: ok, I'm gonna try to find that rt61 pack, where do I look?
11:06	<dandaman32>	in graphical installer, set grub partition to (hd#,#) instead of (hd#)
11:06	<Journeyman>	when I try to reconfigure Xorg I get dpkg-query: parse error, in file `/var/lib/dpkg/available' near line 1:
11:06	<Journeyman>	field name `' must be followed by colon
11:06	<Journeyman>	/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: xserver-xorg is not installed

11:07	<soundray>	Abom: sec
11:07	<deserteagle>	it messes up something or other
11:07	<Stonekeeper>	fade_uk: thanks for your time pal
11:07	<TomasDeAquino>	how do i install divx player
11:07	<xMorgawr>	guys, if anybody uses or programs with gtk 2.0, what's the difference with "gtk_button_new_with_label" and "gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic"?
11:07	<Stonekeeper>	is that persistent?
11:07	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: wireless-rate 54M
11:07	<vincent>	Does anyone know how to get a higher res than 1024*768?
11:07	<|thunder>	no it is not persistant
11:07	<livingdaylight>	Q: if something says it needs python 2.4 then would 2.51 cover it?
11:07	<deserteagle>	vincent: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
11:07	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: in /etc/network/interfaces to make it aplpy on startup
11:07	<soundray>	Abom: http://www.ralinktech.com.tw/data/RT61_Firmware_V1.2.zip
11:07	<ardchoille>	xMorgawr: If no one here answers that, you might try asking in ##gnome
11:07	<|thunder>	vincent; edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
11:07	<xMorgawr>	thanks ardchoille
11:08	<jupdike>	All I can get with my present configuration is VGA 800x600.  How do you tell Ubuntu what monitor you have?
11:08	<ajehuk>	livingdaylight - usually - but you mey be able to install both if not
11:08	<surviver>	jrib, well it depends iam using 64 bit system and it only works for 32 bit system but there are fixes ;) so np :)

11:08	<piglit>	hhmmm stil cant find where to tell the ubuntu partitioner where the / is i can make a logical volume but i cant name it / and if i call it root (dont know what to do else) it tell's me there is no root partition
11:08	<surviver>	jrib, is it true there is no spyware in linux?
11:08	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: not sure, I've had it in there pre-nm-applet

11:08	<jrib>	surviver: I've never heard of any
11:08	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: but I'm unaware of any other way of configuring it

11:09	<ajehuk>	surviver - you can get some if you are stupid enough but not by default
11:09	<Stonekeeper>	iwconfig is reporting 54Mps! How do i know it's true?

11:09	<radar1976>	ok I gots a wierd one...
11:09	<jrib>	surviver: yeah, you don't need to worry about stuff like viruses or spyware as long as you don't go off executing random binaries from the internet
11:09	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: try transferring something and see if it's any faster?

11:09	<soundray>	Abom: are you new to Ubuntu?
11:09	<ajehuk>	livingdaylight - it can get a bit interesting, usually you would install multple binaries / libraries with lsightly different names and then tell the application tat need them where they are - try with the later version first though.
11:10	<Cafe_>	guys, i need to run an mysql server at the best performance possible, but i still need to use X on this PC: will i get better performance installing ubuntu-server? or can i install ubuntu-desktop??
11:10	<radar1976>	I just installed LAMP + DNS for 7.04 and that went fine, however reboot and I'm at the command prompt... whats the root password
11:10	<radar1976>	I was never prompted for that info
11:10	<Stonekeeper>	yeah, thing is, i was only setting it because i felt second-class with 11mbps. i dont actually have any other wireless devices ;)

11:10	<ajehuk>	surviver - or installing from unknown / untrusted sources -

11:11	<Stonekeeper>	thats interesting, it's wlan0 in my /etc/network/interfaces, but eth1 through ifconfig
11:11	<ardchoille>	!default | Horscht
11:11	<ubotu>	Horscht: To change the default application for a filetype in Nautilus, right-click on a file, select Properties ->	Open With, and then change the setting. In Kubuntu, Konqueror ->	Settings ->	Configure and then hit "File Associations"
11:11	<fade_uk>	Stonekeeper: odd it's eth1 everywhere for me
11:11	<Stonekeeper>	and i got ath0 and eth2 on top
11:11	<Horscht>	k, thanks
11:11	<fade_uk>	eth0 = wored NIC
11:11	<ajehuk>	surviver - i.e. an incomming odf file in email wont take over your PC but recieving a source package, and then randomly installing it as root would be a bad idea.  Linux is just as potentially vulnerable as windows - its just that the automatic spreading is damn near impossible and privillage escalation is harder as you probably dont use root.
11:12	<Stonekeeper>	whored nic lol
11:12	<Stonekeeper>	oh no, my bad o.O
11:12	<Lobosque>	how much time is secure run Ubuntu from Live CD? (i'm talking about the physical part)

11:40	<PriceChild>	!xconfig | zoexii
11:41	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about xconfix - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
11:41	<ubotu>	zoexii: To reconfigure your X server, open a console and type  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  - To configure only the driver and resolution, type  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh  - See also !FixRes

11:41	<zoexii>	PriceChild, cool thanks, will try!
11:41	<ardchoille>	cotton: If /home/jordan/Desktop/Vanilla-1.1.2 is a directory, you need to use: sudo cp -r
11:41	<chn>	Enselic__ I am opening with bootable cd to install but when desktop comes I cant understand anything
11:41	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, apt-get install gparted
11:41	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, i can apt-get it though
11:41	<cotton>	ah thanks
11:41	<Enselic__>	Hasrat_USA: just backup the current one, then rename .backup
11:41	<Moniker42>	hey, i have a thin green line along the bottom of VLC when i play some avi files

11:41	<Moniker42>	any idea what could be causing it?
11:42	<Enselic__>	chn: the install CD desktop or the installed system desktop?
11:42	<soundray>	ae|: can you ssh to the machine that you want to scp to?
11:42	<ae|>	soundray: i get the password prompt but even though i put the root password it doesnt let me in
11:42	<Hasrat_USA>	Enselic__: um what do you mean? rename xorg.conf.backup to what?
11:42	<h3h_timo>	is there any reason the repositories would be down??
11:42	<latoo>	OOnull00: usually a driver issue
11:42	<ardchoille>	cotton: Why are you copying stuff to /var/www/apache2-default ?
11:42	<ae|>	soundray: let me that
11:42	<andy_>	hi guys im running 7.04 and get unable to set xfer on ata2 on startup ne ideas?
11:42	<livingdaylight>	HI
11:42	<Enselic__>	Hasrat_USA: first backup xorg.conf with sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup.20070421
11:42	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, cool its installing,.... thanks for the direction... i'm learning this stuff slowly but surely
11:42	<Narada>	soundray: is there a bot command for searching for packages in festiry
11:42	<livingdaylight>	Q: can someone help me with Mediubuntu?
11:43	<chn>	Enselic__ I have a ubuntu 6.10 CD DEsktop cd
11:43	<soundray>	ae|: it doesn't allow root access probably. Try scp to your user account and use sudo cp to put it in the final location
11:43	<Enselic__>	Hasrat_USA: then sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
11:43	<livingdaylight>	the first thing it says in medibuntu is to adda gpg key
11:43	<Hasrat_USA>	oh i see what you mean now. thanks enselic gonna try now
11:43	<PriceChild>	Narada, packages.ubuntu.com
11:43	<Enselic__>	chn: is the motherboard quite new?
11:43	<livingdaylight>	but i get an error back
11:43	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: 'sudo rename /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup.old' after that 'sudo rename /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/x11/xorg.conf'
11:43	<cotton>	ardchoille: Because I want my personal files there instead of the "It works
11:43	<cotton>	file
11:43	<ae|>	soundray: thats it
11:43	<soundray>	Narada: you mean as in apt-cache search? I don't think so
11:43	<ae|>	soundray: thanks
11:43	<chn>	Enselic__ yes but maybe the problem with my ATI CARD
11:43	<Hor|zon>	KurtKraut,  you can use the scripts/program that comes with bittornado
11:43	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, its the /dev/sdb correct?............. also is it bad to put a drive in my hotswap bay while the system is on?
11:43	<cotton>	and ardchoille,that command doesn't work
11:43	<argesarg>	Hello
11:43	<Enselic__>	chn: if you can, try 7.04, it has better support for new motherboards
11:43	<ardchoille>	cotton: I believe you just need to copy stuff to /var/www to be able to view index.html in a browser
11:44	<cotton>	ahh
11:44	<Hasrat_USA>	idefixx: but i'm sure i dont have to back up the current one. i just want to replace the current one (it's screwed) with xorg.config.backup
11:44	<h3h_timo>	hey all, could someone explain to my why i cant install amarok???
11:44	<chn>	7.04 ups :D when did it released
11:44	<Enselic__>	chn: when you boot, you can switch resolution (F4) iirc, try to set different resolutions if you can't see the desktop
11:44	<Narada>	soundray: yeah that would be too much bandwidth going back and forth :)
11:44	<agnivesh>	Is there any visual website (template) designer for Ubuntu ? Please, suggest.
11:44	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: ups sry... forget the last command I said that has to be 'sudo cp /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup.old /etc/x11/xorg.conf'
11:44	<Enselic__>	chn: 19th :)
11:44	<Hasrat_USA>	uh okay i get it :P
11:44	<argesarg>	After installing the ATI drivers the Desktop effects no longer work. I just get a message that says "The Composite extension is not Available"
11:44	<chn>	hmm new:D
11:44	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, I wouldn't do it
11:45	<soundray>	Narada: use packages.ubuntu.com instead
11:45	<chn>	so www.ubuntu.com :)
11:45	<estebandid0>	hi there i got this message when i try to upgrade to 7.04 failed to fecth http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-proposed/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2: MD5Sum mismatch any help??
11:45	<spikeb>	argesarg: ati's drivers dont support composite.
11:45	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, k.... do i want an msdos disk label?
11:45	<Narada>	soundray: good one
11:45	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA:If you dont have to backup it just issue 'sudo rename /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/x11/xorg.conf'
11:45	<Enselic__>	chn: releases.ubuntu.com/7.04
11:45	<Madpilot>	agnivesh, try Nvu
11:45	<chn>	thanks Enselic__ I will come again if I have problems
11:45	<Hor|zon>	technically it shouldn't do any harm...but I don't know how those work with the motherboard...
11:45	<cotton>	ardchoille: I don't have perms to use the /www/ dir, so I need to use the sudo command anyway, right?
11:45	<lino16>	i try upgrade my notebook to feisty. i did this message:   xserver-xorg-driver-all: Hngt ab: xserver-xorg-driver-i810 soll aber nicht installiert werden
11:45	<argesarg>	Will there be a time when it does?
11:45	<Hasrat_USA>	yeah!
11:45	<ardchoille>	cotton: You usually need to use sudo for anything outside your $HOME
11:46	<Enselic__>	chn: I might be asleep then :)
11:46	<Madpilot>	Someone remind me how to go about mounting the alternate CD as a repository?
11:46	<dave177>	I'm trying to set up MythTV and a PVR-250 card on Fiesty. I'm not having too much luck finding a guide out there written for Fiesty. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
11:46	<Enselic__>	chn: I'm sure someoneelse will be around to assist though
11:46	<chn>	Enselic__ I cant see 64Bit CD for intel
11:46	<soundray>	!apt-file >	Narada, in case you didn't know this one
11:46	<chn>	?
11:46	<agnivesh>	madpilot: how to install it through synaptic ? I don't see it in synaptic.
11:46	<cotton>	ardchoille: oh, well, even so, the command you gave me doesn't work: sudo cp -r /home/jordan/Desktop/Vanilla-1.1.2 /var/www/
11:46	<Enselic__>	chn: for 64 bit intel you use AMD64 too
11:46	<Madpilot>	ubotu, info nvu
11:46	<ubotu>	Package nvu does not exist in feisty
11:46	<argesarg>	Is there a disadvantage of not using the ATI driver and leaving the Desktop effects on??
11:46	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, actually you can do that with hot swap bays
11:47	<ardchoille>	cotton: is /home/jordan/Desktop/Vanilla-1.1.2 a directory?
11:47	<Madpilot>	hmm. it's either changed name, or it's defunt, agnivesh
11:47	<Enselic__>	chn: however, it will reqire more work to ge AMD64 wokring good
11:47	<cotton>	yes ardchoille
11:47	<Narada>	soundray: hmm very innnnnteresting; it is like eix or esearch on gentoo
11:47	<chn>	hmm
11:47	<jester626>	I have an Ubuntu desktop machine as well as an Ubuntu Server set up on a small network. I have Samba working properly. The only problem I am having is that a lot of desktop top applications do not show network shares in the "Save As" portion of the application.  Is there a work-arouond for this minir issue?
11:47	<Enselic__>	chn: if this is your first time, I recomend you to start with i386
11:47	<mystamax>	hello, my broadcom 4300 wireless card shouldn't work of a fresh install of 7.04 should it? I still need to install drivers?
11:47	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, that's their purpose...I've hardly ever used em before so I wasn't sure
11:47	<joan>	ola
11:47	<killermuhkuh>	@ argesarg, maybe :) it could lag.. if not, dont take care of it :)

11:47	<Goshawk>	hi, using dekstop installation cd, can i set up a rdp server (using command line because the pc doesn't have a screen) to start up a RDP/VNC server and then install the system logging from a remote machine?
11:47	<cotton>	It
11:48	<agnivesh>	then how can I install it on feisty , any idea
11:48	<argesarg>	Is the Desktop Effects going to be supported by the ATI drivers any time soon?
11:48	<cotton>	ardchoille: ??
11:48	<Hasrat_USA>	idefixx:

11:48	<Madpilot>	agnivesh, not sure. I'd recommend using Screem or Bluefish & handcoding, anyway - you get far better HTML that way.
11:48	<PurpZeY>	Will I have difficulty configuring a wirelss card that is mounted on my laptops motherboard?
11:48	<Madpilot>	argesarg, ask ATI.
11:49	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: sry im to tiered to give advice my fault give me a sec
11:49	<argesarg>	I think that millions of people have done that
11:49	<cotton>	ardchoille: /home/jordan/Desktop/Vanilla-1.1.2: directory
11:49	<argesarg>	XD
11:49	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, understood
11:49	<Hasrat_USA>	lol okay :P
11:49	<ardchoille>	cotton: And sudo cp -r isn't working at all?
11:49	<Hasrat_USA>	thanks man
11:49	<latoo>	agnivesh: look in add/remove programs in programming. Nvu is in there
11:49	<cotton>	correct ardchoille
11:49	<b52laptop>	hi
11:49	<b52laptop>	any one using tora?
11:49	<ardchoille>	cotton: Never seen that before.
11:49	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, quick question.... do I want an msdos disk label? Also, what filesystem do i wan?
11:49	<argesarg>	Would this work better with an Nfoce card?
11:49	<KurtKraut>	Hor|zon, thx
11:49	<agnivesh>	latoo: I'm going to look there
11:49	<mystamax>	anyone?
11:50	<spikeb>	argesarg: yes, much better with nvidia stuff.
11:50	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: 'sudo mv /etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/x11/xorg.conf'
11:50	<latoo>	agnivesh: search in that category for web, there's a lot
11:50	<frank_>	salut
11:50	<LegoLinux>	Hi
11:50	<deserteagle>	can someone help me with some nasty nvidia drivers issues?
11:50	<kernel06>	is there a way i can use msfonts in system wise in ubuntu. my fonts doesn't look good in my ibm laptop. just finished loading 7.04.
11:50	<frank_>	iam an new ubuntu user and have massive problems with the flash plugin for firefox
11:50	<LegoLinux>	I have a problem with the nVidia driver for Ubuntu
11:51	<argesarg>	What is stopping good ATI drivers from being maid copyright laws?
11:51	<cotton>	ardchoille: :( Would it be damaging if I just change the permission of /var/www temporarily
11:51	<frank_>	LegoLinux:  me not, installed very fine
11:51	<cotton>	so I can move the files
11:51	<argesarg>	And ATI being a bitch
11:51	<ajehuk>	argesarg - probably ATI
11:51	<Hasrat_USA>	okay thanks let's try that idefix
11:51	<ardchoille>	cotton: That's not a wise practice, you would be better off trying to find out why sudo cp -r isn't working when it should.
11:51	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, if you want to use it in windows
11:51	<deserteagle>	LegoLinux: maybe i can help, im having issues with nvidia drivers too
11:51	<spikeb>	ATI can't write windows drivers either, so i think they have nobody to blame but themselves.
11:51	<bkiller>	hi gus
11:51	<LegoLinux>	My X server has crashed and it can't get up
11:51	<bkiller>	hi guys
11:51	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: that'll work rename was the completely wrong command ;)
11:52	<argesarg>	Well what advantage is it to leave the drivers in and not use the effects?
11:52	<frank_>	LegoLinux: make sure you change the driver loine from nv to nvdia
11:52	<deserteagle>	LegoLinux: what does it say at the end?
11:52	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, i want to keep all my downloaded files on it and my /home directories
11:52	<LegoLinux>	done that
11:52	<LegoLinux>	still crashed
11:52	<deserteagle>	does it say NVIDIA module not found?
11:52	<necr0mancer>	Can somebody help me with my sound?
11:52	<spikeb>	if the open source driver supports your card, there is no advantage to using ati's drivers other than games.
11:52	<LegoLinux>	Nope
11:52	<Journeyman>	LegoLinux if you just upgraded to feisty good luck!
11:52	<randomwalker>	you can make sudo not foget passwords using timestamp_timeout=-1 :) i've been trying to figure out how to do that for ever
11:52	<jez>	Hi everyone
11:52	<agnivesh>	latoo: please tell me exactly where should I look ? is it in synaptic ?
11:52	<Journeyman>	feist is broken
11:52	<deserteagle>	Journeyman: why do you say that? :(
11:53	<deserteagle>	really?? O_o
11:53	<Hasrat_USA>	mv: cannot stat `/etc/x11/xorg.conf.backup': No such file or directory
11:53	<spikeb>	works great for me.
11:53	<deserteagle>	so im not the only one having crappy colors?
11:53	<kernel06>	i just finished loading 7.04 and i deleted empty panel now i couldn't find any applications after i minimize. any idea. thanks
11:53	<Hasrat_USA>	wtf is going on in here idefixx? :(
11:53	<LegoLinux>	Says somethin like: no suitible device found, check the config and try again
11:53	<jez>	Has anyone upgraded to Feisty Fawn yet?
11:53	<deserteagle>	me
11:53	<necr0mancer>	Anyone having trouble with sound on feisty?
11:53	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, well grub only understands msdos disk labels so if you're using the stock ubuntu bootloader and you possibly wan to bott off of it in the future then you need the msdos disk label
11:53	<spikeb>	jez: i did a fresh install.
11:53	<Hasrat_USA>	necro not here
11:53	<deserteagle>	ditto spikeb
11:53	<kitche>	kernel06: you got rid of the taskbar of gnome
11:53	<Hor|zon>	want to boot*
11:53	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: well that menas you dont have a backup file or at least its not the name you said
11:53	<ardchoille>	jez: I did a fresh install of Feisty
11:53	<kernel06>	kitche:yes
11:53	<cotton>	ardchoille: Someone said "Why would you need a recursive option for changing directories?"

11:54	<Tim02>	but that doesnt work
11:54	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, if not, is there a better choice or does it matter?
11:54	<jez>	Did anybody manage to either do an over-install or an upgrade, rather than a full blown install?
11:54	<Shauny>	im getting the error libapache2-mod-php4: Depends: apache2-mpm-prefork  blah blah when i try to install libapache2-mod-php4
11:54	<sacater>	is there a channel for PDA's in ubuntu
11:54	<kitche>	kernel06: you will have to readd it you can rightclick on the panel and see if there is Add Panel option
11:54	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: Do a 'ls -l /etc/X11'
11:54	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, not really
11:54	<deserteagle>	Journeyman: so feisty itself is having issues with nvidia drivers?
11:54	<Tim02>	does anybody know what command i should try?
11:54	<ardchoille>	cotton: cp copies a file/dir, cd changes a directory. Which did you use?
11:54	<soundray>	jez: yes
11:54	<SlickMcRunfast>	Is there an easy way for a windows computer to access files on my ubuntu machine?

11:57	<dodgyville>	I have a laptop without a floppy, CD-rom or network connection. In fact, all it has is a usb port. It is running Ubuntu 6.10 and I want to upgrade it to Fawn. Is it possible to copy all the ,debs to a 1gb USB flash drive and somehow tell upgrade-manager to use that as a repository?
11:57	<obsethryl>	i would appreciate it very much
11:57	<Hor|zon>	SlickMcRunfast, I had this problem...you need to set up guest access properly

11:57	<Tim02>	and do you know how to do it in terminal
11:57	<Hasrat_USA>	okay i'm gonna reboot
11:57	<foug>	randomwalker: darn
11:57	<variant>	dodgyville: copy the alternative iso to the flash drive and you can upgrade with that

11:57	<necr0mancer>	Can somebody help me get my sound working on feisty?
11:57	<Tim02>	how to disable it that is
11:58	<obsethryl>	of note i am not asking for help i just want to ask a couple of questions to somebody who is considered regular staff in here
11:58	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, is there a way to create a directory that is ouside of /home on my secondary drive that all users can access like /music /movies etc
11:58	<jez>	Is it worth upgrading to Feisty? Edgy works really well for me right now?
11:58	<Shauny>	why do i get the error libapache2-mod-php4: Depends: apache2-mpm-prefork  when i try to install libapache2-mod-php4?
11:58	<ajehuk>	obsethryl - there is probably a list of staff + irc nicks somewhere....
11:58	<variant>	Tim02: you want no networking or just no wireless?
11:58	<deserteagle>	necr0mancer: try alsamixer, make sure the PCM channel isnt muted
11:58	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, is that as simple as creating the folder and setting permissions?
11:58	<master_>	i keep getting Failed to lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
11:58	<sid>	How can I tar/bzip2 a directory to maximum compression?
11:58	<necr0mancer>	Okay, thanks, I'll try.
11:58	<obsethryl>	ajehuk: do you see any ops around?
11:58	<randomwalker>	foug, try googling for linux clear file cache or something like that
11:58	<variant>	obsethryl: #ubuntu-opps
11:58	<variant>	obsethryl: #ubuntu-ops
11:59	<avb>	Shauny: apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork
=== Vaxu_ is now known as Vaxu
11:59	<avb>	Shauny: have u tried?
11:59	<obsethryl>	variant: thnx
11:59	<foug>	randomwalker: is it bad that all my memory is cached? all the time
11:59	<d4rky-pl>	bry
11:59	<Kyral>	foug: Nope
11:59	<ompaul>	b52laptop, it would not be usual to find oracle users here at the weekend
11:59	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, well what you want to do is create a folder, set the permissions and then set in mount point in fstab
11:59	<cotton>	lolol ardchoille, it was -R not -r!
11:59	<Kyral>	its how Linux does things
11:59	<Lordveda>	Can I after installing ubuntu desktop edition install servers via network after adding apt-repositories? My humble thinking tells that the answer is yes is my thinking right?
11:59	<foug>	Kyral: hmm
11:59	<Kyral>	It puts stuff into memory in case you need it again soon
11:59	<randomwalker>	foug, no, if you needed memory for programs it would automatically clear the cache
11:59	<variant>	foug: to see real memory useage use the vmstat command
11:59	<b52laptop>	ompaul,  :)
11:59	<dodgyville>	variant: Thanks!
11:59	<Shauny>	tryavb, it says i a;lready have the latest version
11:59	<ardchoille>	cotton: man cp shows: -R, -r, --recursive
11:59	<Tim02>	<variant>	when i run iwconfig
11:59	<Kyral>	because grabbing stuff from Memory is faster than grabbing it from HD
11:59	<ardchoille>	;)
11:59	<Tim02>	it shows a connection
11:59	<seb_>	hello :) I'm having some trouble setting up my mouse... I'm following a guide, but things are way different :P Anyone cares to help?

12:00	<master_>	is there an upgrade help subchannel?
12:00	<Lordveda>	soundray: my thinking is right?
12:00	<variant>	foug: check vmstat?
12:00	<Kyral>	(We are talking nanoseconds vs. milliseconds here)
12:00	<Kyral>	or just "free"

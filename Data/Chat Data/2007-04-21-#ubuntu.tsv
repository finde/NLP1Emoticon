[negative]	[12:01]	<ross>	Hey, I just installed feisty.  The network manager app worked fine to start with, but I needed to check something with ifconfig.  After using ifconfig, the network manager doesn't work correctly( ie. no info on active connection )
[neutral]	[12:01]	<Tusk>	SnakePliske1, join the club...unfortunately what can I do?

[neutral]	[12:02]	<cedricshock>	Glos_WiFi, bios messages you can't see, but everythin after linux starts can be viewed with the dmesg command.
[neutral]	[12:02]	<JoseStefan>	mwe, please hold...
[negative]	[12:02]	<Fringe4>	My video is stuck in 800x600 mode, and I can't update the video driver. It keeps saying there is an apt based error and then stopping.
[negative]	[12:02]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock, How did you say to connect using cmd?
[negative]	[12:03]	<AATDark>	Blubloblu and what happens if you try CNRL D ?
[negative]	[12:03]	<Tusk>	SnakePliske1, I understand that, but I want to have 3d support, so what options do I have beyond the Nvidia drivers?
[neutral]	[12:03]	<Glos_WiFi>	cedricshock: no its not a bios message, its a message that shows when linux starts, so il have a loog at dmesg then

[positive]	[12:04]	<ubotu>	ohgood: PowerPC.  Formerly used by Apple for the Macintosh line of computers. Variants are now used in popular gaming consoles. PPC was a fully supported Ubuntu architecture up to and including edgy. It is now a community port, see @HLINK
[negative]	[12:04]	<mwe>	JoseStefan: hmm. check /etc/fstab. It sounds odd
[neutral]	[12:04]	<AATDark>	Blubloblu and what is sd4 ?

[neutral]	[12:07]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: That log is odd - you can see it spitting the 1680 mode out but not explicitly the 1900
[neutral]	[12:07]	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: probalby a connection issue ?
[negative]	[12:07]	<costas>	eck: but anything else would be a benefit over xterm which has nothing at all really
[negative]	[12:07]	<gabriela>	4dcomsa: i can not see my desktop
[neutral]	[12:07]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: However the fact that one gets spat out because of max dot clock is interesting
[neutral]	[12:07]	<eck>	costas: use gnome-terminal
[negative]	[12:07]	<JoseStefan>	mwe, doing swapoff -a, followed by swapon -a, fixes the problem until reboot

[negative]	[12:09]	<AATDark>	Blubloblu: insret it and try to check the filesystem on sd4
[negative]	[12:09]	<Blubloblu>	yeah, i have the Desktop Feisty
[positive]	[12:09]	<cedricshock>	costas: Tab completion comes from the shell (such as bash), not the terminal.
[positive]	[12:09]	<eck>	costas: you can also use screen which is in some sense better than tabs, but also a bit more complicated to use
[negative]	[12:09]	<Xy0n>	okay, where do i run the chroot command from?
[neutral]	[12:09]	<Xy0n>	grub?
[negative]	[12:09]	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: it does say 1920 is not valid, but the too big part is maybe cuz this panel doesnt have that res in its list dunno

[negative]	[12:10]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: You could try explicitly adding a modeline
[negative]	[12:10]	<AATDark>	LaszloKv, cedricshock: this must work if the samba server is up
[positive]	[12:10]	<TashKavarish>	ddcprobe lists 1920 but not 1650 so the too big probably = not supported

I can access it as root, but I want to be able to change it in my normal user account. When I try to change permissions in nautilus as root it keeps changing back on me.

[negative]	[12:40]	<Orfeous>	tesuki, did you get my messages in private?
[neutral]	[12:40]	<Jordan_U>	cac_, System -> Administration -> Printing
[positive]	[12:40]	<maccam94>	cac_, usually you go into system -> administration -> printing -> add new printer
[negative]	[12:40]	<robbie_crash>	Jordan_U: Nope.
[negative]	[12:40]	<spar-due>	 I'm not able to bridge my network connections with vmware or virtualbox...any reason why i can't with the latest kernel and feisty?

[negative]	[12:40]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Didn't your monitor have a max of 155MHz though?  Thing is that line is only about 48Hz
[negative]	[12:40]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Sorry, I was muted.
[neutral]	[12:40]	<patrick_>	maccam94, well is that easily solved
[neutral]	[12:40]	<Blubloblu>	AATDark: gute NAcht
[negative]	[12:40]	<tesuki>	Orfeous, yes i did
[negative]	[12:40]	<cac_>	I know how to go to the printer
[neutral]	[12:40]	<cac_>	menu

[neutral]	[12:40]	<AATDark>	LaszloKv: i'm levaing .. cedricshock will get it
[negative]	[12:40]	<Orfeous>	tesuki, ok, i dont not got any answers
[negative]	[12:40]	<jpsamara>	How do I set up pdnsd (or dnsmasq) under Feisty? I don't want to mess with network manager
[negative]	[12:40]	<cac_>	the problem is that I can't find the printer driver for my lexmark x1185
[negative]	[12:41]	<crazy_penguin>	how do i set up cupsd to add a printer. i can't pass the athentication part in the browser. i used lppasswd to make new passwords but nevertheless i can't authenticate myself to the cupsd daemon. how can i fix this?
[neutral]	[12:41]	<Orfeous>	tesuki, ops..
[positive]	[12:41]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Thanks AATDark.
[neutral]	[12:41]	<fonz_>	maccam94: i seem to fix the error by switching it from http -> ftp
[positive]	[12:41]	<Orfeous>	tesuki, wrong of me.. i did ;)
[negative]	[12:41]	<ryanakca>	someone pinged?
[neutral]	[12:41]	<TashKavarish>	the xorg log says the nvidia card has max 155, not sure if its even related
[negative]	[12:41]	<Orfeous>	sorry
[neutral]	[12:41]	<AATDark>	LaszloKv: my last word ..telnet 127.0.0.1 445 on linux or netstat -planto
[neutral]	[12:41]	<Jordan_U>	spar-due, Yes, @HLINK
[negative]	[12:41]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, no output, when i try: modprobe snd_hda_intel it says module not found
[positive]	[12:41]	<Pelo>	robbie_crash,   in gparted the HDDs appear in the drop down list to the right of the tool bar,  don''T expect to see your hdd in the partition windows,  try that first,  also try unplugging the working hdd and booting the live cd , see if gparted in there see it, considere hardware damange, nicked cables or even broken hdd
[negative]	[12:41]	<fonz_>	maccam94: is there any disadvantage to ftp?
[neutral]	[12:41]	<tesuki>	Orfeous, haha.
[negative]	[12:41]	<Doctor_Nick>	torrent.ubuntu.com is down, is there anywhere else to get the torrents for the fiesty dvds?
[negative]	[12:41]	<maccam94>	patrick_, try opening up a terminal, doing sudo -i, and doing modprobe snd-intel-hda. then check the end of dmesg to see if it says anything
[negative]	[12:41]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: You want to see the results of both?
[negative]	[12:41]	<patrick_>	maccam94, oh and previously when running feisty beta about 1 week ago, when I choose Log Out it just hung the whole system until I powered it down by holding down the power button
[neutral]	[12:41]	<amphacid>	hi there
[neutral]	[12:41]	<maccam94>	fonz_, nope, just different (and occasionally it's a little slower)
[negative]	[12:41]	<TashKavarish>	honestly its like the nvidia driver disables anything over 1600x1200
[positive]	[12:41]	<maccam94>	patrick_, well there's a reason it's called beta ;-)
[neutral]	[12:41]	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv: sure
[neutral]	[12:42]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: use pastebin and put there the output of dmsg
[negative]	[12:42]	<tesuki>	Orfeous, what kind of problem did you have? was it the same as me?
[negative]	[12:42]	<Pelo>	Doctor_Nick,  I can dcc you the  feisty 386 dvd torrent if you want it
[neutral]	[12:42]	<patrick_>	maccam94, do you think it may have been fixed
[negative]	[12:42]	<TashKavarish>	is there any tool i could use to see what edid info my monitor reports?
[positive]	[12:42]	<spar-due>	Jordan_U thanks!! I'll look through that..i really appreciate your help!
[negative]	[12:42]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, nothing about sound..
[negative]	[12:42]	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, Ubuntu.com isn't down for me...

[neutral]	[12:42]	<Doctor_Nick>	jordon: just the torrent.ubuntu.com
[negative]	[12:42]	<maccam94>	Pelo, what's on the feisty dvd? just packages? or does it do lvm, and other stuff?
[neutral]	[12:42]	<Pelo>	Doctor_Nick,  no sorry,  ubuntu , not kubu
[positive]	[12:42]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: is your sound card enabled from bios? :)
[negative]	[12:42]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i'll make the whole dmesg
[neutral]	[12:42]	<fonz_>	maccam94: k, thx
[neutral]	[12:42]	<Skyhook>	does 7.04 have ntfs support?

[neutral]	[12:42]	<maccam94>	fonz_, np
[negative]	[12:42]	<jpsamara>	How do I set up pdnsd (or dnsmasq) under Feisty? I don't want to mess with network manager
[negative]	[12:42]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: sorry, i had to ask
[negative]	[12:42]	<maccam94>	Skyhook, yes, but you have to install it yourself
[neutral]	[12:43]	<Doctor_Nick>	Pelo: no thx
[neutral]	[12:43]	<eck>	does the live cd not do lvm?
[negative]	[12:43]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, actually, i'v ejust noticed, that if i open a gnome-terminal, and press down key, it sounds
[positive]	[12:43]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Telnet connects to 127.0.0.1
[negative]	[12:43]	<BarronVon>	how do you check your kernal version?
[negative]	[12:43]	<Pelo>	maccam94,  no idea,  I just ran out of cds so I'm doing the dvd,  I know I will be able to add most of my packages from it tho, but my sys isnT' very fancy
[negative]	[12:43]	<madman91>	I am having a problem with my mouse... after upgrade to feisty .. my mouse wheel started acting funky,, meaning it didnt work at all.. so after a few days of following failed guides on google and on ubuntuforums.org .. i decided to come here and beg for mercy from the mouse gods

[neutral]	[12:43]	<maccam94>	Skyhook, it's actually just hit digg today. i'll get you the link to the howto
[neutral]	[12:43]	<brenix>	Barronvon: uname
[positive]	[12:43]	<maccam94>	Pelo, you can just burn the cd iso to a dvd you know ;-)
[neutral]	[12:43]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: try aplay <some_file>
[negative]	[12:43]	<cedricshock>	LaszloKv: To the port AATdark was suggesting (400 something)?
[negative]	[12:43]	<Skyhook>	oh cool
[neutral]	[12:43]	<robbie_crash>	Pelo, It was working until I rebooted after upgrading
[negative]	[12:43]	<aoirthoir>	ok bbl
[negative]	[12:43]	<Orfeous>	tesuki, my problem is that i cant mount my second SATA-disk with an ntfs partition, but i can mount my ATA-disk with an ntfs partition.
[positive]	[12:43]	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, I don't think there is a torrents.ubuntu.com to be down :)
[positive]	[12:43]	<patrick_>	maccam94, that can be done
[negative]	[12:44]	<LaszloKv>	AATDark, cedricshock: Yeah, to 445
[neutral]	[12:44]	<Orfeous>	tesuki, i can also mount both ntfs partition if i boot with live-dvd
[negative]	[12:44]	<Pelo>	maccam94,  can I ?  wow,  I just like the dvd anyway,  saves me some bandwith later on
[neutral]	[12:44]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, lots of alsa error and final line: no such device
[neutral]	[12:44]	<robbie_crash>	It's not listed anywhere

[neutral]	[12:44]	<Doctor_Nick>	Jordan_U: torrent.ubuntu.com
[negative]	[12:44]	<Tex_Arcana_>	Is there any fixes or tests to see why certain programs freeze up Feisty? I did a update manager already or do I need to go through every progam and if it freezes reboot uninstall and reinstall?
[negative]	[12:44]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: ok ... so there's nothing in dmesg regarding the sound?
[neutral]	[12:45]	<Pelo>	robbie_crash,  I'm stumped
[negative]	[12:45]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Nah I don't know clone stuff

[negative]	[12:45]	<belux>	how can I burn a cdrom from iso.gz file?
[neutral]	[12:45]	<LaszloKv>	cedricshock: Should pastebin the results on netstat -planto?

[negative]	[12:45]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: ok
[neutral]	[12:45]	<jrib>	robbie_crash: only by reinstalling

[negative]	[12:45]	<TashKavarish>	guess only thing i havent tried is scrapping the entire xorg.conf and start fresh
[negative]	[12:45]	<maccam94>	dcomsa, ah i might know your problem. i'm not on a laptop, but there's a special line to pass to make it use different modes

[neutral]	[12:46]	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, @HLINK
[negative]	[12:46]	<Pelo>	belux,   I think you need to unpack from gz first and then burn the iso  ( who is the idiot who make a that )

[neutral]	[12:46]	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: btw would you happen to know how to fix 2 network cards that randomly swap their ip configs?
[negative]	[12:46]	<cedricshock>	Is there any way to get overall apt-get progress, via kill or some such?
[negative]	[12:46]	<dcomsa>	maccam94: it's just that in edgy and dapper the headphones didn't worked by default
[neutral]	[12:46]	<Doctor_Nick>	jordan_U: rather, the DVD kubuntu feisty
[negative]	[12:46]	<Valstorm2379>	Normally this file would extract by using windows.

[neutral]	[12:47]	<soothsay>	Or reboot
[neutral]	[12:47]	<Valstorm2379>	okay I'll phrase it again

[positive]	[12:48]	<eck>	Ice_Wewe: I would not use it, especially since the restricted drivers manager does a lot of the things that automatix does
[neutral]	[12:48]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Is it that eth1 and eth2 keep swapping arounbd which card they are or is it that the IP each one gets is different?
[neutral]	[12:48]	<belux>	patrick_: a ISO file?
[neutral]	[12:48]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, checked it?

[negative]	[12:49]	<DiceyDays>	Hey everyone. I am about to upgrade from Dapper to Edgy because of some repository/python problems. Were the problems people were having was because they upgraded the 'unofficial' way as opposed to (sudo update-manager -c)?
[positive]	[12:49]	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: nic1 and nic2 swap which is detected as which, sometimes nic1=eth1 and nic2=eth2 others its the opposite, when theyre opposite the ip configs remain same so things no longer work
[positive]	[12:49]	<Doctor_Nick>	the reason #1 you shouldn't install Automatix is because it will probably mess up your next distro upgrade

[neutral]	[12:50]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Try   man iftab
[neutral]	[12:50]	<eck>	SaveFerris: add it to the modprobe blacklist
[negative]	[12:50]	<ResPiDeR>	kitche what do you mean? gnome is ok... gdm too... I installed nvidia drivers and they are ok too
[negative]	[12:50]	<trevor_>	is it possible to set up ubuntu desktop as a lamp server :s?
[negative]	[12:50]	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Since you want gnome, the easiest thing to do is install the desktop first, and then toss on server packages.
[neutral]	[12:51]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: asus laptop?
[neutral]	[12:51]	<eck>	SaveFerris: i think the file is /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[positive]	[12:51]	<Wymark>	OK, Can someone help me with installing Ubuntu on my XP. I want Ubuntu on a seperate HD than my XP and to be able to switch between them at start-up, but I am somewhat close to clueless on how to do this. Any help would be very appreciated.
[negative]	[12:51]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, nope, packard bell, but they use the same card
[negative]	[12:51]	<globaldj>	I'm new to Linux how do i install xmms theme and where is it located?
[negative]	[12:51]	<trevor_>	cedric, is this easy to do. . . sorry im new to linux really - attempted it on suse and failed miserably. . .and then decided suse sucked. . .
[neutral]	[12:51]	<TashKavarish>	iftab only lists eth0 interesting
[neutral]	[12:51]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i saw it on google, that lots of asus have the same problem
[neutral]	[12:51]	<belux>	patrick_: thx, It's worked!

[negative]	[12:51]	<SaveFerris>	eck: what if i can't get to terminal? i'm stuck in grub because when i try to boot into recovery mode, it hangs indefinetely
[negative]	[12:51]	<pleed>	can someone please help me i cant install libapache2-mod-security over apt-get. it says that there is an entry in the database but the file is not on the server... there s also no descriptopn to libapache2-mod-security. can anyone confirm that on feisty fawn?
[negative]	[12:51]	<kitche>	ResPiDeR: the window manager hs to be started metacity gets replaaced with emerald or something else but it's not when the new window manager is started
[neutral]	[12:51]	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: No
[negative]	[12:51]	<eck>	SaveFerris: use the recovery option
[positive]	[12:51]	<patrick_>	belux, no probs nice one:)
[negative]	[12:51]	<jdsbluedevl>	hmm, let me send it again
[positive]	[12:51]	<eck>	SaveFerris: it will drop you into a root console
[negative]	[12:51]	<Pelo>	Wymark,  just install ubuntu to your second hdd, and it will install grub at as aboot manager, that will give you a menu when you boot so you can select which os you want
[positive]	[12:52]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: strange, i have an asus aca3 and it works
[negative]	[12:52]	<SaveFerris>	eck: lol i'll try again
[positive]	[12:52]	<cedricshock>	trevor_: The big packages for you toinstall later will be apache2, mysql-server, and php5-(something gotta look it up)
[negative]	[12:52]	<Pelo>	Wymark,  you donT need to do anything special
[negative]	[12:52]	<Wymark>	Oh, ok sorry. THANK YOU.
[negative]	[12:52]	<compengi>	Wymark: you just need to make the ubuntu partition ext3 or ext2 then install it and you can choose on boot
[negative]	[12:52]	<jdsbluedevl>	" all I know is that afterwards, I get this message: ""W: udev hook script requires at least kernel version 2.6.17 | W: not generating requested initramfs for kernel 2.6.15-20-386"""

[positive]	[12:52]	<trevor_>	cedric, thanks for you help - much appreciated :)
[negative]	[12:53]	<cedricshock>	trevor_: Yeah it's pretty easy. You can do everything (except editing config files-need a text editor) with the guis in the desktop
[negative]	[12:53]	<Fitzsimmons>	hey all, when I enable desktop effects, it appears to work but my windows don't have any decorations
[neutral]	[12:53]	<Fitzsimmons>	know how to fix this?
[negative]	[12:53]	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: I think that not generating initramfs isn't a problem - it's just trying to update one of your ancient kernels that is there - as for the mdadm - if you don't have a raid, do you have an /etc/mdadm/mdadmconf ?
[negative]	[12:53]	<belux>	Guys, problems with boot download Supergrub and be happy: @HLINK

[negative]	[12:53]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, was it /etc/modules/blacklist?
[positive]	[12:53]	<penguin42>	jdsbluedevl: Take a copy of it, and then delete it and see if it will work then - I don't think you should need it
[negative]	[12:53]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, where was it?
[neutral]	[12:53]	<dcomsa>	miranda82:  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[neutral]	[12:53]	<Pelo>	VR_,  try theforum
[negative]	[12:53]	<TashKavarish>	penguin42:  so if i put eth1 mac xx:xx:... it should always map the mac's to those ethN ?
[negative]	[12:54]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, oh, yes
[negative]	[12:54]	<eck>	SaveFerris: ouch. I would try the live cd (or booting off another distro if you have one)
[neutral]	[12:54]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Yes
[negative]	[12:54]	<kitche>	ResPiDeR: as I said start the window decator(sp?) it might be called emerald or something different I haven't looked at feisty to know what is used in it for desktop effects

[negative]	[12:54]	<TashKavarish>	do i need to restart for it to take effect?
[neutral]	[12:54]	<SaveFerris>	and then find the modprobe blacklist and add emu10k1 to it? (with livecd)
[neutral]	[12:54]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Probably
[negative]	[12:54]	<retry>	it doesnt seem like a kernel modules issue
[neutral]	[12:54]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, it has: blacklist snd_intel8x0m
[neutral]	[12:54]	<miranda82>	
[neutral]	[12:54]	<SaveFerris>	eck: all i've got is the edgy live cd

[negative]	[12:54]	<billy>	thx belux.  I was looking for that link yesterday.
[negative]	[12:54]	<Pelo>	TashKavarish,  restarting x should do it   ctrl alt backspace

[negative]	[12:55]	<gallag>	The bittorrent tracker does not seem to be responding -- any alternate torrents or am I alone?

[negative]	[12:55]	<Pelo>	gallag,  it seems down for me too but I already have a load of peers so I'm ok
[negative]	[12:55]	<pleed>	hey can anybody help me? the upgrade on feisty fawn deleted my apache2-mod-security and i cant install it now...

[negative]	[01:07]	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: you don't need to regenerate the initramfs to save changes to the init scripts
[negative]	[01:07]	<Azul>	why does ubuntu not have a CLI install
[negative]	[01:07]	<Flannel>	Azul: they do.  get the Alternate CD.
[neutral]	[01:07]	<fishcake>	Azul, Alternate does

[neutral]	[01:08]	<TashKavarish>	penguin42:  i dont see how single/dual could matter, the display is singlelink (as are 99% of dvi things) and it worked before I swapped it for a 1440x900 monitor

[neutral]	[01:08]	<Azul>	duh!!!
[negative]	[01:08]	<jdsbluedevl>	oh, ok, wasn't sure if there was something wrong with the init scripts
[neutral]	[01:08]	<greg_g>	Flannel: yes

[negative]	[01:08]	<Flannel>	greg_g: then yeah, you can just delete /home and expand /.  You'll need a liveCD

[neutral]	[01:09]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: OK, well in that case you need to find a 1920x1200 mode line that fits in 155MHz bandwidth
[negative]	[01:09]	<eck>	SaveFerris: remove the splash and quiet lines from the kernel line in grub and see if you can figure out where it is trying to load the module
[negative]	[01:09]	<Flannel>	Vinitious: If you want buttons, you'll need to install a GUI.  The server is CLI only by default.

[negative]	[01:09]	<Vinitious>	kbrooks, there's no interface for the server edition, or do I have to install it??
[neutral]	[01:09]	<jrib>	!download > Azul    (Azul, see the private message from ubotu)
[negative]	[01:09]	<jdsbluedevl>	well either way, running update-initramfs does not remove the message
[neutral]	[01:09]	<greg_g>	thanks Flannel and erUSUL btw
[neutral]	[01:09]	<jrib>	Azul: get what thing working?
[negative]	[01:09]	<LjL>	"how do you change locale settings? (i.e. what's output by ""locale"")"
[neutral]	[01:09]	<nuOpus>	does anyone know what I can use to take video of a session and save it as flash?
[neutral]	[01:10]	<xtknight>	Azul, @HLINK
[negative]	[01:10]	<kbrooks>	Vinitious, there's none but u can get a GUI
[neutral]	[01:10]	<holden>	Wiseguy: /etc/rc.local
[neutral]	[01:10]	<Azul>	jrib, get ubuntu install working
[negative]	[01:10]	<TashKavarish>	penguin42: no such thing, lowest ive found is that 193 pixel clock one
[positive]	[01:10]	<xtknight>	LjL, LC_* environment variables (type env for an example)
[negative]	[01:10]	<Vinitious>	no option for that while installing JN_coward
[neutral]	[01:10]	<TashKavarish>	but the 155 doesnt add up
[negative]	[01:10]	<LjL>	xtknight: right, but i mean permanently - where're they supposed to be set?
[neutral]	[01:10]	<JN_Coward>	Vinitious: sudo apt-get install gnome or something...
[negative]	[01:10]	<TashKavarish>	its like the videocard side is messing it up or something, putting an artificial limit
[negative]	[01:10]	<Azul>	my god! the alternate install is another 700MB
[negative]	[01:10]	<disinterested>	nu0pus: recordmy desktop does the video of ur desktop but it uses alot of hd space
[neutral]	[01:10]	<Flannel>	nuOpus: @HLINK
[negative]	[01:11]	<soothsay>	Azul: Huh? You only need one of them
[negative]	[01:11]	<greg_g>	oh, I guess one more question about the partition thing, after I delete /home and expand /, do I just copy /home to the / ??
[negative]	[01:11]	<xtknight>	LjL, ah im not sure
[negative]	[01:11]	<penguin42>	TashKavarish: Well somewhere between your monitor and display card they've decided they have a limit of 155 on that DVI link - now I don't know if that is unreasonable or not - you might be able to turn it up somewhere
[neutral]	[01:11]	<Vinitious>	sudo apt-get install kde for kde?
[neutral]	[01:11]	<fishcake>	Vinitious, do sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[negative]	[01:11]	<JN_Coward>	Vintious: google around if you MUST have a GUI, but seriously, if you are running a server, what do you want it for?
[neutral]	[01:11]	<Flannel>	greg_g: /home will be gone after you delete it.
[neutral]	[01:11]	<fishcake>	Vinitious, do sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[negative]	[01:11]	<TashKavarish>	theres a thought, how could i temporarely swap to a generic video driver, one that supports 1920x1200 as software rendering only
[negative]	[01:11]	<Wiseguy>	"holden, is there any sort of synatx for adding a command? or just type it in before the ""exit 0""vline?"
[negative]	[01:11]	<Azul>	soothsay, but i already download the default install disc just to find out that i have to get the other one
[neutral]	[01:11]	<holden>	"Wiseguy: just add it before ""exit 0"""
[positive]	[01:11]	<greg_g>	so then while still in the liveCD I recreate the home folder?
[negative]	[01:12]	<Xyon>	I've got Ubuntu up and running, but could only do so by booting into recovery mode and using startx.  How can I get my typical setup of Ubuntu to run fine from grub?
[negative]	[01:12]	<jdsbluedevl>	"eck, I'm still receiving the ""defines no arrays"" message in update-initramfs.  Should that still be cause for concern, or just disable mdadm?"
[positive]	[01:12]	<soothsay>	Azul: Look into jigdo
[neutral]	[01:12]	<SaveFerris>	eck: i removed the quiet line, which one is splash? i've got root, kernel, initrd, and savedefault
[positive]	[01:12]	<jean_>	No sketchup like software for linux.. :-)
[negative]	[01:12]	<Flannel>	greg_g: eh?  Inside of the / partition, you'l need to copy your /home stuff
[neutral]	[01:12]	<Vinitious>	JN, to perform some things like setting up an FTP server, I have too setup a website
[positive]	[01:12]	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: if you aren't running mdadm i don't think it will be a problem
[positive]	[01:12]	<jrib>	LjL: I'm guessing gdm will set those if you change language when you login
[neutral]	[01:12]	<SaveFerris>	nvm
[neutral]	[01:12]	<SaveFerris>	i found it
[neutral]	[01:12]	<pse>	/where dippe2
[neutral]	[01:12]	<pse>	..
[neutral]	[01:12]	<pse>	sry
[negative]	[01:12]	<latoo>	Vinitious: if you need a gui, you may as well install Ubuntu desktop and then install your service stuff on top
[neutral]	[01:13]	<Betzefer>	how can i hok up my laptop to my tv using my tv out
[neutral]	[01:13]	<Betzefer>	 ?
[negative]	[01:13]	<jean_>	Bad... I need to design a House...
[negative]	[01:13]	<greg_g>	Flannel: yeah, so I don't just boot LiveCD, delete /home, expand /, reboot.  Before I reboot, I copy the backup of /home to the now expanded / right?
[negative]	[01:13]	<LjL>	"jrib: he's on KDE, but you know, when you install the installer asks about location and language... i wonder what the package to reconfigure is, if it's a package to reconfigure. do you have a ""LANGUAGE"" variables in ""locale"", anyway?"
[negative]	[01:13]	<Xyon>	I've got Ubuntu up and running, but could only do so by booting into recovery mode and using startx.  How can I get my typical setup of Ubuntu to run fine from grub?
[negative]	[01:13]	<jdsbluedevl>	eck, even after disabling mdadm, I still get the mdadm errors
[neutral]	[01:13]	<dcomsa>	need some help with lirc + tvtime. anyone with a good tutorial?
[positive]	[01:13]	<Azul>	is it easy to install the nvidia drivers in the new ubuntu?
[neutral]	[01:13]	<antioch>	Can anyone tell me how I can enable the following on ubuntu: instead of spinning the scroll wheel to scroll through documents, hold down the scroll wheel and move the mouse up and down to scroll -- thanks!
[positive]	[01:13]	<swinchen>	Hi there.  Does anyone have a WinPVR-150 up and working?  my friend has one and he is having a heck of a time with it.
[positive]	[01:13]	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: this is when you are booting?
[neutral]	[01:13]	<Vinitious>	yes, but configuring LAMP takes a lot of time for me, latoo
[neutral]	[01:13]	<jrib>	LjL: locale doens't output LANGUAGE here
[positive]	[01:13]	<latoo>	Azul: was easy for me
[neutral]	[01:14]	<jdsbluedevl>	no, this is the update-initramfs
[neutral]	[01:14]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, i fixed it
[neutral]	[01:14]	<Flannel>	greg_g: Wrong order.  You mount both, copy /homes partition contents into /s partition (in the folder /home) then delete /home and expand /.
[neutral]	[01:14]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: cool. how?
[negative]	[01:14]	<latoo>	Vinitious: so what's your question...
[negative]	[01:14]	<jdsbluedevl>	I haven't tried booting yet, b/c I'm concerned that I won't be able to boot again
[negative]	[01:14]	<izm99>	hey all.  I get the following error when dist-upgrading from dapper to feisty: @HLINK  any suggestions?
[neutral]	[01:14]	<miranda82>	dcomsa,
[neutral]	[01:14]	<Flannel>	greg_g: Once you've deleted /home (the partition), there won't be any data to copy
[negative]	[01:14]	<Flannel>	izm99: you can't upgrade from dapper to feisty.  You need to go through edgy
[negative]	[01:14]	<Azul>	latoo, did you do apt-get install nvidia-glx?
[neutral]	[01:14]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, compiling the driver
[neutral]	[01:14]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, @HLINK
[negative]	[01:15]	<LjL>	jrib: i thought so, neither does it here... but it does for him, @HLINK , and might be related to the VLC errors he gets @HLINK
[negative]	[01:15]	<izm99>	Flannel, oh.  darn.  :(
[neutral]	[01:15]	<jean_>	%C7Any google sketchup like program for linux???
[negative]	[01:15]	<latoo>	"Azul: no, used the ""restricted manager"" thing in the admin menu"
[positive]	[01:15]	<systemd0wn>	Question - fresh install of 7.04, internal Atheros wifi card worked fine.  After playing with kismet a bit (and working) i booted back to windows and while it shows the wifi card there it will not connect to a network, or scan.  Booted back to ubuntu same thing... ideas?
[negative]	[01:15]	<greg_g>	yeah, right, I meant, backup /home now (to hdb1), boot LiveCD, delete /home, expand /, copy /home to now expanded /
[negative]	[01:15]	<Vinitious>	how too het a GUI, latoo, I am gonna try: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop like someone metioned
[negative]	[01:15]	<izm99>	Flannel, ok, thx.
[negative]	[01:15]	<eck>	jdsbluedevl: i'm not sure how you would be able to tell if it was a problem without rebooting
[neutral]	[01:15]	<Vinitious>	how to get
[negative]	[01:15]	<jdsbluedevl>	well, I guess I'll just try to reboot and see what happens
[negative]	[01:15]	<SaveFerris>	eck: just by sheer luck, it loaded the whole thing (this happens like once in 10 tries) so i'll try and actually fix the alsa problem now, thanks alot though
[negative]	[01:15]	<covOPprometheus>	I just dist-upgraded from edgy to feisty, but the wvdial package breaks at setup and therefore ubuntu-desktop is unable to install. how can I fix this (modem is not needed)
[positive]	[01:15]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: :) beleive me or not, i was going to suggest that
[negative]	[01:15]	<Flannel>	greg_g: ah, copy your backup, yeah.  Therell be a folder /home inside of that partition, put the stuff you backed up inside of there.  And you'll need to delete the /home line in your fstab too.
[neutral]	[01:15]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, lol, it worked
[negative]	[01:16]	<jdsbluedevl>	hopefully I'll be back
[neutral]	[01:16]	<Azul>	latoo, thanks for telling me cuz i got enough problems with ubuntu already
[neutral]	[01:16]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: well good news
[negative]	[01:16]	<latoo>	Vinitious: if you don't want to reinstall you can do that or apt-get gnome-desktop. X is a waste of ram for a server but if you need it you may as well install the desktop distro. It'd be easier
[negative]	[01:16]	<robbie_crash>	Why would hardware info crash right off the bat, off a fresh upgrade to 7.04?
[negative]	[01:16]	<greg_g>	Flannel: delete /home in fstab ??  lost me there
[positive]	[01:16]	<miranda82>	dcomsa, thx for helping
[positive]	[01:16]	<dcomsa>	miranda82: now, do you happen to have some experiences with tv tunners? :)
[positive]	[01:16]	<tatter1>	I just got lircd working on my avermedia  studio infrared V chuffed :)
[neutral]	[01:16]	<jean_>	%C7Alguem sabe de um software igual ao %C4google sketchup para Linux???
[negative]	[01:16]	<Flannel>	greg_g: in a file, /etc/fstab, it tells your computer what to mount where.  You'll need to remove the /home one, since you no longer have a home partition
[positive]	[01:16]	<andre_pl>	so who's got wireless? :P
[neutral]	[01:17]	<Flannel>	!es | jean_

[negative]	[01:17]	<Vinitious>	can I bother you for a second in PM, latoo, it goes way too fast here?
[neutral]	[01:17]	<greg_g>	Flannel: ahh, makes sense
[negative]	[01:17]	<Rage__>	Ok, I am having serious problems with my laptop's crappy soundcard. Realtec ACL202 rev 0 / ATI IXP it will play for a while then start jumping and statiking any ideas?
[neutral]	[01:17]	<latoo>	Vinitious: sure
[positive]	[01:17]	<antioch>	How can i configure linux so that when I hold down the middle button (mouse wheel) and I then move the mouse up or down it will make the current window scroll up or down?
[negative]	[01:17]	<Enselic_>	Has anyone succeded in connecting to a remote Ubuntu X server? I am failing but I am not sure why...
[positive]	[01:17]	<Flannel>	Enselic_: Are you using XDMCP? or what?
[negative]	[01:18]	<latoo>	"Enselic_: how are you trying? tried ""ssh -X remote""?"
[negative]	[01:18]	<dcomsa>	jono: do you have a good link on how to configure lirc (given your post on the planet)?
[negative]	[01:18]	<Enselic_>	Flannel, latto: I'm trying to set DISPLAY=ltop:0  where ltop is my laptop, and I try to connect from my desktop
[neutral]	[01:18]	<greg_g>	thanks a lot Flannel, I do this later tonight
[negative]	[01:19]	<jrib>	LjL: tried reconfiguring locales?  is this in #kubuntu?
[positive]	[01:19]	<Pelo>	antioch,  I remember seeing someting about that in the forum,  or something similar,   you need to modify xorg.conf to configure your mouse button,   check in the forum
[negative]	[01:19]	<latoo>	Enselic_: I just use ssh when I want to run a single app. No idea about remoting x though
[negative]	[01:19]	<antioch>	Pelo I did but couldnt get any relevant hits - any idea what the article you were reading was called?
[negative]	[01:20]	<LjL>	jrib: it was in #kubuntu, it's in a private query now (you know, pastes and such, sigh). anyway, i'm realizing it's a complete mess. i thought he was on edgy, but apparently he's really on dapper with an edgy sources.list
[negative]	[01:20]	<pleed>	can someone tell me how to downgrade to edgy eft if it s possible
[negative]	[01:20]	<Pelo>	antioch,   I'm pretty sure it wasn't about that specificaly,  but search for mouse buttons
[negative]	[01:20]	<kbrooks>	I have a problem. A  basic one that Ubuntu seems to be missing.
[neutral]	[01:20]	<pse>	HL
[neutral]	[01:20]	<eck>	pleed: it is not possible without reinstalling
[negative]	[01:21]	<soothsay>	kbrooks: Okay
[positive]	[01:21]	<dcomsa>	lirc expert wanted :)
[negative]	[01:21]	<robbie_crash>	Is there a way to check to make sure that everything is installed properly?
[negative]	[01:21]	<jrib>	LjL: I got these locale errors during edgy upgrade, was painful.  So that is probably related
[positive]	[01:21]	<kbrooks>	I have a wireless windows computer on a network. *How* (with or without samba) do I share files between the two of them?
[negative]	[01:21]	<xtknight>	oh LjL is it the perl errors
[neutral]	[01:21]	<xtknight>	i got those in a chroot
[neutral]	[01:21]	<jrib>	pleed: only by reinstalling
[neutral]	[01:21]	<LjL>	xtknight: among other things, yeah
[neutral]	[01:21]	<xtknight>	about invalid LC_ALL or w/e
[positive]	[01:21]	<pleed>	well thanks jrib
[negative]	[01:21]	<xtknight>	yeah it's easy to fix, too bad i dont remember what i did
[neutral]	[01:22]	<kbrooks>	I prefer without samba
[neutral]	[01:22]	<xtknight>	i had googled around fora while

[neutral]	[01:22]	<latoo>	kbrooks: Ubuntu can connect to windows shares out of the box

[neutral]	[01:22]	<dcomsa>	c'mon ppl, i got to make my bloody remote to work. anyone with lirc experience?
[negative]	[01:22]	<kbrooks>	latoo, I don't want to do a windows share for now. Must I?
[negative]	[01:22]	<jrib>	pleed: that configures anything that isn't configured
[neutral]	[01:22]	<latoo>	kbrooks: no, there's alternatives but less easy
[negative]	[01:23]	<TokenBad>	ok I got the new ubuntu and want to dualboot with windows 2000...is there a tutorial for this or can someone tell me how to safely do it?
[negative]	[01:23]	<pleed>	jrib, and when i want to bring my ubuntu to default configuration?
[negative]	[01:23]	<eck>	kbrooks: if you just want to grab things off the computer just do places > network
[positive]	[01:23]	<kbrooks>	latoo, well, the reason is that I'm on xubuntu, heh :-)
[neutral]	[01:23]	<pigeonflight>	anyone setup feisty on a macbook pro yet?
[neutral]	[01:23]	<latoo>	kbrooks: if you install cygwin on the windows machine you can use SSH, which is secure
[negative]	[01:23]	<jrib>	pleed: what kind of settings are we talking about?
[negative]	[01:23]	<tatter1>	all I can say about lirc   is using input device whatever instead gpoi eeetc and irrecord rmoteee instead of teemplaate

[negative]	[01:24]	<Skwid_>	should i use xinerama ?
[negative]	[01:24]	<qwerxy>	soothsay: i'm trying to upgrade!
[neutral]	[01:24]	<xilly>	Enselic : you can always try to use vnc to connect to your desktop
[negative]	[01:24]	<pulse>	upgrade will take the rest of your life.
[negative]	[01:24]	<latoo>	kbrooks: that limits your options then. There's an X server for windows...
[positive]	[01:24]	<pulse>	grab a beer and relax
[neutral]	[01:25]	<latoo>	kbrooks: or ftp...
[negative]	[01:25]	<covOPprometheus>	I just dist-upgraded from edgy to feisty, but the wvdial package breaks at setup and therefore ubuntu-desktop is unable to install. how can I fix this (modem is not needed)
[positive]	[01:25]	<Hubris>	I need to revert back to an older version of a package than is offered under Feisty...as they broke it a couple versions ago.  I'm assuming I need to add an Edgy repository, and use Synaptic to try force the downgrade....correct?
[negative]	[01:25]	<pleed>	jrib i did something wrong in aptitude so a lot of software deinstalled and now some programs say that they need resources, the upgrade crashed my apache2 .... and my mysql server has been deleted too
[neutral]	[01:25]	<darx>	hi folks

[neutral]	[01:26]	<pleed>	jrib, pastebinning? what s that i dont understand
[neutral]	[01:26]	<kbrooks>	latoo, install on which what
[negative]	[01:26]	<xilly>	Enselic_ : oh ok , but with ssh I think that you can run only 1 aplication at the time
[neutral]	[01:26]	<jrib>	!pastebin | pleed
[neutral]	[01:26]	<ubotu>	pleed: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[negative]	[01:26]	<NemesisD>	hi, i have totem and mplayer, both of which should be able to play FLV files at this point but whenever I open an FLV file each application opens for a second then closes, whats up with that?
[negative]	[01:26]	<robbie_crash>	I am missing one hard drive from my fstab, it's listed, but apparently its uuid and dev/* have changed since upgrading so it will no longer mount. How can I determine what it is, when it doesn't show up in gparted, and I can't open hardware information  because it crashes as soon as I load it up. I have two questions: 1) how can I figure out what the drive is now, and 2) how can I fix the crashing with hardware information?
[neutral]	[01:26]	<jrib>	NemesisD: any output on a terminal?
[negative]	[01:26]	<eck>	Hubris: if it is just one package, I think you are best off downloading the .deb, reinstalling it, and then pinning it with apt_preferences
[negative]	[01:26]	<qwerxy>	soothsay: oh - i see what you mean - yes i could do that, but i'd also like to know why this isn't working...?
[neutral]	[01:26]	<latoo>	kbrooks: install ftp server or client on ubuntu or windows?
[neutral]	[01:26]	<pleed>	ah i see thanks jrib,ubotu
[negative]	[01:26]	<Enselic_>	xilly: I'm not talking about using ssh, just setting DISPLAY=host:0

[negative]	[01:26]	<Vinitious>	sas I understand, when running Ubuntu server, normally one configures everything trough the command prompt?

[neutral]	[01:27]	<Hubris>	eck - It's the VNC4Server package....I know the revision under Edgy that 'worked'....the update in Edgy broke it..so I stayed with the old one.  Feisty doesn't offer that old version.

[negative]	[01:28]	<joshjosh_>	robbie_crash, just give me a recommendation
[positive]	[01:28]	<latoo>	honestly, even a windows share might be more secure than ftp :-)
[positive]	[01:28]	<jrib>	NemesisD: totem gives the same?
[negative]	[01:28]	<darx>	ok.. there is no samba file under init.d/

[neutral]	[01:28]	<jasin>	The fawn was feisty, but I got the system upgraded.

[positive]	[01:29]	<darx>	does nautilus depend on samba to browse shares?

[neutral]	[01:29]	<kbrooks>	latoo, no, and will never be, unless the owner sells me the laptop

[negative]	[01:30]	<eck>	Vinitious: no, they are for different things
[negative]	[01:30]	<jasin>	Anyone know what the alternate desktop cd is? I
[negative]	[01:30]	<jasin>	Anyone know what the alternate desktop cd is?
[neutral]	[01:30]	<eck>	Vinitious: there are some things that ssh would not be suitable for that ftp would
[negative]	[01:30]	<Vinitious>	eh, yes or no?
[negative]	[01:30]	<JDSBlueDevl>	thx a bunch eck, although I have a feeling I'll have to live with that annoying mdadm array message
[neutral]	[01:30]	<Vinitious>	file transfer?
[negative]	[01:30]	<jasin>	Sounds like its xubuntu, says its for systems with less then 256mbs.
[negative]	[01:30]	<darx>	barbarella_me: i'm not running a samba server... just a client
[negative]	[01:30]	<eck>	Vinitious: ssh is a waste if you don't need encryption and usually implies that you are going to give users login accounts
[neutral]	[01:30]	<magnetron>	Vinitious: yes, ssh has file transfer too
[negative]	[01:30]	<jrib>	jasin: it's the tradition text-based install (no X needed to install) and lets you use the disk as a repository for ugprading as well
[neutral]	[01:30]	<barbarella_me>	darx:no you don't, cause you are using smbclient, not the server
[negative]	[01:31]	<Vinitious>	ok
[negative]	[01:31]	<cables>	I've installed libdvdcss2 from the Seveas repository, and DVDs play fine when I insert them. However, if I open totem and go to Movie>Play Disc, it doesn't work. Does anyone have any ideas?
[negative]	[01:31]	<darx>	babbarella_me: so how do i restart it?
[positive]	[01:31]	<jasin>	jrib, I see, thanks.
[positive]	[01:31]	<eck>	Vinitious: but ssh is very good if you need encryption or already have a login and don't want another service running
[negative]	[01:31]	<eavatar>	for some reason I can't listen any sound, but when I do the sound test it is ok and generates a loud pitch
[neutral]	[01:31]	<latoo>	Vinitious: you can use gnome-vfs to connect to an ssh server (ie. places menu) to transfer files in nautilus
[positive]	[01:31]	<bayziders>	eck: thanks.
[positive]	[01:31]	<systemd0wn>	Question - fresh install of 7.04, internal Atheros wifi card worked fine.  After playing with kismet a bit (and working) i booted back to windows and while it shows the wifi card there it will not connect to a network, or scan.  Booted back to ubuntu same thing no networks... ideas?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<latoo>	Vinitious: or use scp
[negative]	[01:31]	<jasin>	jrib, why not just use xubuntu instead though?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<barbarella_me>	darx:you can't
[neutral]	[01:31]	<elpargo>	hi does 7.04 was ship with a highly verbose python or is that a new feature of 2.5?
[positive]	[01:31]	<magnetron>	Vinitious: don't use ftp, it is very insecure
[negative]	[01:31]	<flugenhiber>	anybody got any ideas about grub error 17?
[negative]	[01:31]	<covOPprometheus>	I just dist-upgraded from edgy to feisty, but the wvdial package breaks at setup and therefore ubuntu-desktop is unable to install. how can I fix this (modem is not needed)
[neutral]	[01:31]	<darx>	hmmm
[negative]	[01:32]	<NemesisD>	jrib, i had to use an alternative version  of the i8l0 driver because it didnt' like my widescreen resolution
[neutral]	[01:32]	<jrib>	jasin: xubuntu is not the same
[negative]	[01:32]	<robbie_crash>	I am missing one hard drive from my fstab, it's listed, but apparently its uuid and dev/* have changed since upgrading so it will no longer mount. How can I determine what it is, when it doesn't show up in gparted, and I can't open hardware information  because it crashes as soon as I load it up. I have two questions: 1) how can I figure out what the drive is now, and 2) how can I fix the crashing with hardware information?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<kitche>	jasin: the alternate cd is for people that don't like the livecd and it's debian like
[neutral]	[01:32]	<barbarella_me>	darx:a client is not a service
[negative]	[01:32]	<xilly>	Enselic_ : hum , I never used it, I think that I can't help you because I always used ssh -X to connect to my pc, what I was thinking that your problem was how to connect to your pc from a remote place, but that is clearly not your problem . I'm Sory that I can't help you
[positive]	[01:32]	<Vinitious>	it's for a local testing server for now, I'll check SSH one time, got enough acronyms for the day now ;-)
[negative]	[01:32]	<jrib>	NemesisD: hmm, do you think taht may be related?  Try using vesa just to see if the problem goes away
[negative]	[01:32]	<eck>	magnetron: it can be insecure to use ssh when you really want to be using ftp
[positive]	[01:32]	<jasin>	jrib, I understand but it runs well on older systems also and it has a desktop.
[neutral]	[01:32]	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, uninstall the package?
[negative]	[01:32]	<eck>	magnetron: e.g. if you want anonymous access
[negative]	[01:33]	<jrib>	jasin: right, but for some people, they may not be able to get into X at all
[negative]	[01:33]	<NemesisD>	jrib, i'm willing to try it, but how do i change it back and forth? i'm not too experienced with that
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Enselic_>	xilly: np
[positive]	[01:33]	<magnetron>	eck: very true
[negative]	[01:33]	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, I tried so, but the thing is I can't install ubuntu-desktop without it
[negative]	[01:33]	<testytester>	anyone have problems with beryl on feisty?
[neutral]	[01:33]	<_doppelganger_>	argh, back
[neutral]	[01:33]	<jasin>	kitche, see the response I gave jrib
[negative]	[01:33]	<jrib>	NemesisD: make a backup of /etc/X11/xorg.conf then run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and choose vesa.  After you are done restore the backup
[positive]	[01:33]	<Hydrocodone>	woo, just installed and got mr res working, its been awhile :D
[negative]	[01:33]	<elpargo>	"covOPprometheus, ahhh wonderfull ""base install"", how about trying to upgrade that package first?"
[negative]	[01:33]	<bitmess>	testytester: I have problems with Beryl on anything
[positive]	[01:33]	<jasin>	jrib, 256mb wont get you into the desktop on xubuntu?
[negative]	[01:34]	<indecision>	robbie_crash: you could try replacing the UUID in your fstab file with the drive's device name instead.  you'll need to figure out that that is, of course.
[negative]	[01:34]	<samk>	does anyone know how to install icon themes?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<tommyv>	hiiiiiiii
[negative]	[01:34]	<atiredmachine>	Hello, when I downloaded the latest updates to Feisty like a week ago I could no longer boot up using the newest kernel (2.6.20-15).. I've filed a bug report and nobody I've talked to has any ideas.. so my question is, is there a way I can just install that one so that GRUB will default to 2.6.20-14 instead on bootup so I don't have to sit make sure I select the right one?
[positive]	[01:34]	<testytester>	I have a toshiba satellite, and it worked fine on edgy
[negative]	[01:34]	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, did you dist-upgrade to latest 6.10 before trying to go to 7.4?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<atiredmachine>	*uninstall
[negative]	[01:34]	<kitche>	jasin: what does that have to do with my response I don't like the livecd sicne I have tons of them anyways and the livecd needs more then 256 mb but gnoem can run on 256 megs of ram easily

[neutral]	[01:34]	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, yes

[negative]	[01:34]	<robbie_crash>	indecision, I can't figure that out without hardware information or fdisk, and it doesn't show up in either

[negative]	[01:34]	<NemesisD>	alright ill give it a try and let you know jrib, thanks!
[negative]	[01:35]	<jasin>	kitche, then we are in agreement, I dont like live cd's much either
[negative]	[01:35]	<jrib>	jasin: well, just don't work right away, is what I should have said
[negative]	[01:35]	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, wvdial doesn't set up, I have read about the bug with wvstreams, but haven't found a solution that works for me
[negative]	[01:35]	<robbie_crash>	well it might in hw info, but since that keeps crashing :(
[negative]	[01:35]	<testytester>	I already tried the beryl channel
[neutral]	[01:35]	<latoo>	tommyv: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[positive]	[01:35]	<eck>	atiredmachine: it is called something like that -- it makes it so grub selects the last kernel you booted

[negative]	[01:39]	<indecision>	remember to specify which partition, too... so /dev/hde1 or whichever

[negative]	[01:42]	<latoo>	bayziders: sounds like a source package? did you try searching for it at getdeb?
[negative]	[01:42]	<eck>	mtm8: it depend on what you are trying to do, i always forget when you need it. if you have problems with networking things mount it
[negative]	[01:42]	<elpargo>	bayziders, that is not a deb package it seems like a slackware package, I suggest you find a deb or else you will have to a) make a manual build b) learn how to make a .deb

[negative]	[01:42]	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, same problem, it won't set up, you see the installation isn't the problem, but it freezes at autoconfiguration
[neutral]	[01:42]	<elpargo>	g35, what problems? I have it running just fine
[neutral]	[01:43]	<bayziders>	Latoo: What is getdeb?
[negative]	[01:43]	<Xyon>	why cant i start compiz?
[neutral]	[01:43]	<latoo>	bayziders: a deb website. google it

[neutral]	[01:43]	<HYPOCRISY>	Hi
[negative]	[01:43]	<elpargo>	Xyon, which compiz? be more specific please
[neutral]	[01:43]	<g35>	my server runs on port 443\
[neutral]	[01:43]	<hatredx`>	hi
[neutral]	[01:43]	<RypPn`>	hi
[negative]	[01:43]	<MrMakeveli>	dcomsa, that looks a mlilion time better
[negative]	[01:43]	<MrMakeveli>	i'll give it a try
[negative]	[01:43]	<latoo>	bayziders: I mean, it's an Ubuntu specific site that hosts apps in deb format
[neutral]	[01:43]	<jasin>	I see ubuntu still hasn't fixed the synaptics touchpad problems
[negative]	[01:43]	<mtm8>	eck: It isn't updating my environment variables
[neutral]	[01:43]	<eck>	atiredmachine: it is probably X locking up, which is probably a driver issue. I'm not sure there is much you can do
[neutral]	[01:44]	<Xyon>	compiz for gnome
[negative]	[01:44]	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, could you try that with apt-get install and pastebin the error?
[positive]	[01:44]	<variant>	jasin: works for me fine..
[neutral]	[01:44]	<g35>	i do host:443
[positive]	[01:44]	<Xyon>	it wont replace my current x manager
[neutral]	[01:44]	<g35>	i get connection refused
[neutral]	[01:44]	<variant>	jasin: have you submitted a bug report?
[neutral]	[01:44]	<Xyon>	i believe i have the correct video drivers installed
[negative]	[01:44]	<indecision>	jasin: the one where it hangs the pointer periodically?  I'm getting that on an old dell I put ubuntu on
[negative]	[01:44]	<ubuntu>	"When installing feisty off of the livecd, it fails at creating the ext3 filesystem with the message: ""The ext3 file system creation in partition #2 of SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) failed.""  any ideas as to what could have caused this, or how to fix it?  (I am using a Maxtor SATA drive)."
[positive]	[01:44]	<elpargo>	Xyon, is this the first time? which version of ubuntu?
[negative]	[01:44]	<atiredmachine>	eck, thanks, I'm using nvidia.. is this likely to to be fixed at some point?
[neutral]	[01:44]	<HYPOCRISY>	I'll soon find out
[neutral]	[01:44]	<Xyon>	7.04
[neutral]	[01:44]	<hatredx`>	I'll think about it
[neutral]	[01:44]	<RypPn`>	no
[negative]	[01:44]	<eck>	mtm8: there must be some bash option to clear them. do you need them to be cleared?
[negative]	[01:44]	<elpargo>	"Xyon, is that the ""build in"" one?"
[negative]	[01:44]	<Xyon>	this is the first time i've tried to start compiz and i'm on 7.04
[negative]	[01:44]	<robbie_crash>	indecision, I think that told me where the drive is, cause it's on the second ide controller chip, on its second channel, and the other drive that's on that controller, on the other channel, is sda, and then my sata drive is sdc
[negative]	[01:44]	<NemesisD>	jrib, is there a way just to set the driver rather than having to go through that whole reconfigure, i messed it up somewhere and broke X11, lol
[negative]	[01:45]	<ajehuk>	I take it the host isnt running anything else on 443 (ie its the default https port...)
[negative]	[01:45]	<elpargo>	Xyon, what video card you have?
[negative]	[01:45]	<bayziders>	latoo: it is not there.
[neutral]	[01:45]	<jrib>	NemesisD: well you can try to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf directly
[neutral]	[01:45]	<eck>	atiredmachine: it would have to be fixed by nvidia. I suspect that if you ssh in after it locks up and look at the logs you will find some kernel messages about the nvidia driver misbehaving
[neutral]	[01:45]	<mtm8>	eck: Of course.
[neutral]	[01:45]	<Xyon>	ATI X700
[negative]	[01:45]	<ajehuk>	g35 I take it the host isnt running anything else on 443 (ie its the default https port...)
[neutral]	[01:45]	<darx>	jrib: how can i check if dma is on?
[negative]	[01:45]	<kitche>	elpargo: thbere is only one compiz right now since beryl hasn't switched over yet
[positive]	[01:45]	<jasin>	variant, my touchpad works fine in windows, gparted live cd, partition magic boot disk, etc.. so its not my laptop its ubuntu.
[neutral]	[01:45]	<jrib>	!dma > darx    (darx, see the private message from ubotu)
[positive]	[01:45]	<mtm8>	eck: chroot'ing into something without updating environment variables is about as good as cd'ing to it.
[negative]	[01:45]	<robbie_crash>	indecision, so I guess it must be sdb, but it's not loading, how can I figure out why not, or where to fix it?
[positive]	[01:45]	<dcomsa>	Xyon: there's a little bit complicated with ati cards
[negative]	[01:45]	<SaveFerris>	ok, so beryl gives my a big white useless screen on xubuntu feisty, so what session do i want to load? (failsafe gnome didn't work)
[negative]	[01:45]	<jasin>	variant,  nice try blaming my system
[negative]	[01:45]	<robbie_crash>	indecision, could it be a bunged up fs?
[negative]	[01:45]	<Xyon>	i've gone through all the crap in the tuts
[neutral]	[01:45]	<latoo>	bayziders: not all apps get packaged for every distro. Check on the main website for the app, and ask around.
[neutral]	[01:45]	<gumjo>	I installed beryl on feisty with video card drivers, and while the effects work the title bar doesn't show....any help?
[neutral]	[01:45]	<Xyon>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[01:46]	<g35>	ajehuk: i can telnet fine into it and run it via my windows box
[negative]	[01:46]	<elpargo>	kitche, that is not true. you could be running compiz that comes with 7.04 or the compiz deb packages that exist from before.
[negative]	[01:46]	<Pupbuntoo>	hi, how do i install libdvdcss on feisty/64?
[negative]	[01:46]	<indecision>	robbie_crash: you sure you're mounting the right partition on that disk?  and yes, it's entirely possible that the partition table or filesystem got messed up.
[negative]	[01:46]	<Xyon>	gumjo: sounds like you need a window decorator
[positive]	[01:46]	<NemesisD>	jrib, just change in the driver section the name vega?
[neutral]	[01:46]	<elpargo>	Xyon, and you have the ati propietary drivers?
[neutral]	[01:46]	<jrib>	NemesisD: you can /try/
[positive]	[01:46]	<jasin>	indecision, yes, the mouse thats built in, the touchpad.
[neutral]	[01:46]	<magnetron>	Xyon: new info about ATI on feisty: @HLINK
[negative]	[01:46]	<bayziders>	Latoo: well how do you install a scource package?
[negative]	[01:46]	<ajehuk>	g35 - cool - OK i have a vnc server now running on port 443 and....
[negative]	[01:46]	<elpargo>	Xyon, searhc for envy it's a script that will get you the correct drivers (not sure if it's updated for 7.04)
[negative]	[01:46]	<SaveFerris>	is it possible to tell beryl to not load at startup from terminal?
[neutral]	[01:46]	<gumjo>	I have Emerald and Heliodor insstalled, both dont show up
[negative]	[01:46]	<Xyon>	i dont know, i got my crap running by using sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx
[neutral]	[01:46]	<Xyon>	correct?
[neutral]	[01:46]	<gumjo>	Envy is available for Feisty btw
[negative]	[01:46]	<NemesisD>	jrib, ok and if it gets messed up, how does one restart x11 from bash?
[neutral]	[01:46]	<jrib>	SaveFerris: ~/.config/autostart/
[negative]	[01:47]	<Madeye>	guys, I need to subscribe to comp.lang.python but I don't know any usenet client, any recommendation ?
[positive]	[01:47]	<eck>	mtm8: look at the man page for env
[neutral]	[01:47]	<elpargo>	SaveFerris, beryl will never load at startup if you don't use that session
[negative]	[01:47]	<jrib>	NemesisD: restore your backup and then 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start'
[negative]	[01:47]	<latoo>	"bayziders: look in the dir for an ""INSTALL"". That's where the instructions would be"
[negative]	[01:47]	<dcomsa>	Xyon: please join #ubuntu-effects. i think they are more experienced in this matter
[neutral]	[01:47]	<magnetron>	Xyon: new info about ATI on feisty: @HLINK , the  ATI X... bug
[negative]	[01:47]	<atiredmachine>	eck, what would I do to ssh in?  usually it only locks up for 5 seconds or so, but once it completely locked up.
[negative]	[01:47]	<robbie_crash>	indecision, there's only one partition on the drive. Let me reboot again and see if I can figure anything out
[negative]	[01:47]	<indecision>	robbie_crash: (un?)fortunately I haven't had to recover a damaged filesystem in linux yet, but there's lots of guides out there with advice on what to do
[positive]	[01:47]	<samk>	anyone know how to get icon themes from gnome-look.com to work?
[neutral]	[01:47]	<Xyon>	thank you guys
[positive]	[01:47]	<elpargo>	ahh good, thanks gumjo
[negative]	[01:47]	<eck>	mtm8: i guess env -i bash as your shell
[negative]	[01:47]	<bayziders>	Nope I listen the files there is a .c a .h a .server and a PKGBUILD file there are no text files all code.
[negative]	[01:47]	<Ax4>	btw

[neutral]	[01:47]	<Ax4>	happy 420 people!
[negative]	[01:48]	<magnetron>	i have got this strange issue: now and then when the computer starts up, it starts in 640x480 screen resolution. if I restart the X server with ctrl+alt+bkspace, it is normal (1280x1024@50Hz) again. How can make it start normal EVERY time?
[neutral]	[01:48]	<systemd0wn>	lol
[negative]	[01:48]	<elpargo>	bayziders, dude you need a .deb file that is not a ubuntu package
[negative]	[01:48]	<denicola>	Help needed, please! Feisty can't install grub properly because it identifies my hda as sdb (I also have a sata drive, identified as sda). Edgy had no problem with this: Grub was installed on hd0.
[negative]	[01:48]	<eck>	atiredmachine: every once in a while the same thing happens on my computer (intel chip). If you are running sshd you can actually log in and usually you can shut down X and recover the machine
[negative]	[01:48]	<Ax4>	university of florida wants to be a 'green' campus
[neutral]	[01:48]	<Ax4>	im like hellz yea!
[negative]	[01:48]	<SaveFerris>	jrib: what do i do with ~/.config/autostart?
[positive]	[01:48]	<indecision>	jasin: yeah, unfortunately I can't offer any advice on fixing it...bugs me too.  but hey, at least you're not alone :)
[neutral]	[01:48]	<jrib>	SaveFerris: look inside for a file that starts beryl
[neutral]	[01:48]	<bayziders>	elpargo it does not have to a ubuntu package to install it, you can install many types of packages in ubuntu.
[positive]	[01:48]	<eck>	mtm8: and of course source a profile afterward
[neutral]	[01:49]	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, @HLINK
[negative]	[01:49]	<magnetron>	i have got this strange issue: now and then when the computer starts up, it starts in 640x480 screen resolution. if I restart the X server with ctrl+alt+bkspace, it is normal (1280x1024@50Hz) again. How can make it start normal EVERY time?
[neutral]	[01:49]	<g35>	ajehuk, ...howd it go?
[neutral]	[01:49]	<jasin>	indecision,  i just use an wireless mouse myself.
[negative]	[01:49]	<indecision>	jasin: I wish I had one.  not worth buying on for this old thing, though... 500mhz and no wireless.  I just use it to tinker with.
[negative]	[01:49]	<elpargo>	bayziders, that is not correct, you can only install deb files, you can run compiled code and you can even install manually but that may make your package manager unstable. Now if you do want to run that you will need to learn or search how to compile and run it.
[negative]	[01:49]	<bacon_>	what/how do i blacklist drivers so feisty will use orinoco drivers for my ambit lan-express 802.11b card?
[negative]	[01:50]	<barbarella_me>	denicola:can you pastebin your partition structure
[negative]	[01:50]	<cedricshock>	Big, slightly off-topic question: If I interchange the two dimms in a computer, will that interchange the order of the memory addresses? Or does the bios just get to pick which one it wants to be first?
[negative]	[01:50]	<SaveFerris>	jrib: cd ~/config./autostart so no such file or directory
[neutral]	[01:50]	<Vinitious>	now, gonna wait for the download, thnx for the help
[neutral]	[01:50]	<jrib>	SaveFerris: ~/.config/autostart/
[negative]	[01:50]	<aimes>	why did the sudo aptitude update got stuck at 99%?
[neutral]	[01:50]	<Vinitious>	bye
[positive]	[01:50]	<jasin>	indecision, I got mine for 10 bucks and its a laser mouse.
[negative]	[01:50]	<g35>	ajehuk, sorry got booted, so what happened
[negative]	[01:50]	<elpargo>	bayziders, I suggest you start by searching their website for instructions on how to build from source. if that is what you got
[positive]	[01:51]	<samk>	anyone know how to get icon themes from gnome-look.com to work?
[negative]	[01:51]	<eck>	bacon_: how is blacklisting them going to help you to use the card?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<variant>	jasin: what?
[positive]	[01:51]	<ajehuk>	g35 hold on a moment...
[positive]	[01:51]	<gumjo>	draq the archive to Theme Manager, Samk
[neutral]	[01:51]	<kitche>	cedricshock: the memory addresses are the same they just depend on the slot theya re in
[positive]	[01:51]	<mtm8>	cedricshock: Good question, I'd be interested in an answer as well.
[positive]	[01:51]	<eck>	samk: open up the theme manager and drag and drop the .tar.gz that you downloaded into it
[negative]	[01:51]	<variant>	jasin: I sugested you open a bug report. I didn't blame anything
[negative]	[01:51]	<latoo>	bayziders: if you read the instructions look for how to install in your /home dir so the app doesn't interfere with packaged apps
[negative]	[01:51]	<bacon_>	is there a channel for wireless?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<benkong2>	bacon_: look in /etc/modules.d/
[neutral]	[01:51]	<samk>	theme prefernences?
[neutral]	[01:51]	<mtm8>	bacon_: #wireless
[negative]	[01:51]	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, that seems like a packaging error, did you search launchpad for bugs on that package?
[negative]	[01:51]	<eck>	samk: yeah
[neutral]	[01:51]	<samk>	preferences
[positive]	[01:52]	<elpargo>	bacon_, yes it has 7

[negative]	[01:52]	<jasin>	variant, its not a bug its some sorta configuration problem, but anyways, I already did submit the problem to ubuntu.
[neutral]	[01:52]	<elpargo>	magnetron, repeating wont get you an answer noone here really knows we can only guesstimate
[negative]	[01:52]	<variant>	"jasin: that is what a bug is, why did you say i was ""blaming your system""?"
[negative]	[01:52]	<covOPprometheus>	elpargo, I have looked for the bug in wvdial, and found something about it frezzing in the autoconfig, but no solution at all
[negative]	[01:52]	<arentoine>	"Hello all, anyone know if the network icon next to the volume icon in festy is supposed to ""blink""  to show some activity like the applet I'm used to have 6.10 ?"
[positive]	[01:52]	<tuesday>	is there anyway i can partition a section of my computer for ubuntu even though its got XP on it with he full hardrive taking that up
[negative]	[01:52]	<cmcculloh>	magnetron, That happens to me when I don't have my screen turned on before I start the computer
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Haekke>	IS it easy to format ubuntu? I have additional disks in, can I just mount them again after a format?
[negative]	[01:53]	<eck>	bayziders: usually something like: ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local will let you install into your homedir
[negative]	[01:53]	<jasin>	variant, no its not.
[neutral]	[01:53]	<latoo>	tuesday: just boot from the live cd and use the partition editor
[neutral]	[01:53]	<_doppelganger_>	guys, lemme me know when you're not busy
[positive]	[01:53]	<magnetron>	cmculloh: thank you! that is probably the issue.
[negative]	[01:53]	<Newise>	Should Ubuntu 7.04 boot from SATA disks? Whatever I do, my computer boots to Windows and I do see any traces of Grub?
[negative]	[01:53]	<elpargo>	tuesday, the program is call gparted is the same latoo is talking about
[negative]	[01:53]	<variant>	_doppelganger_: what is your problem?
[negative]	[01:53]	<indecision>	arentoine: this is just speculation on my part, but it might have to do with your particular network card.  it blinks on my laptop, but not on my deaktop.
[positive]	[01:53]	<cmcculloh>	np ;)
[negative]	[01:53]	<hyperspace>	can i kill a remote dist-upgrade (from gui)that gave up on fetching after max retries and restart with a dist-upgrade via console?
[neutral]	[01:53]	<jasin>	bugs are not configuration problems.
[negative]	[01:53]	<NemesisD>	jrib, i think this computer doesn't like vega...
[negative]	[01:53]	<tuesday>	ok what can i do if the live cd doesnt work?
[positive]	[01:53]	<elpargo>	covOPprometheus, how long ago was that?
[negative]	[01:53]	<cedricshock>	kitche: So I have card A, with addresses 0-255, and card B with address 256-479, and I interchange the slots, then card B will have addresses 0-223, and A will have 224-479?
[negative]	[01:53]	<Flannel>	Newise: You haven't installed grub in the correct place, it sounds like
[neutral]	[01:53]	<jrib>	NemesisD: vesa?
[negative]	[01:53]	<NemesisD>	oh god
[negative]	[01:54]	<variant>	jasin: ok, tell somone else
[negative]	[01:54]	<_doppelganger_>	varient- it seems to be very strange, although i am halfway new
[neutral]	[01:54]	<indecision>	Newise: do you have more than one hard disk, and are they both sata?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<variant>	_doppelganger_: just ask your question
[neutral]	[01:54]	<Newise>	How I can choose where Grub is installed?
[positive]	[01:54]	<arentoine>	indecision : Really ? This is a desktop (wired connection)...

[negative]	[02:17]	<retry>	eck, it makes me wonder if there is some bug in ubu feisty
[negative]	[02:17]	<nowisn>	help installing ubuntu, I have a unallocated space of 51 gig but i'm not sure how to set it up, i'm in the prepare partions window of ubuntu now??
[negative]	[02:17]	<variant>	elpargo: no, there is no system wide way to set the default player for all apps. it's a pita to do it one by one so that way works fine
[negative]	[02:17]	<elpargo>	of course it will work but it's a stupid morronic thing to do
[neutral]	[02:17]	<variant>	elpargo: why?
[positive]	[02:17]	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: don't listen to him
[negative]	[02:17]	<nowisn>	can someone pm if possible for help
[negative]	[02:17]	<variant>	elpargo: give me one good reason why that is a bad idea?
[negative]	[02:17]	<eck>	retry: the fact that it doesn't work isn't too surprising, there are a number of bugs for feisty in LP, but the fact that it would work in xubuntu is beyond me
[neutral]	[02:17]	<Pelo>	retry,  we know there are bugs in fiesty,  the fun is figureing out where they are
[neutral]	[02:17]	<ajehuk>	nowisn - what would you like to know?
[positive]	[02:17]	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, don't listen to whom ?
[negative]	[02:17]	<elpargo>	variant, then that means ubuntu needs a widget to change that but making your system like that is not good.
[neutral]	[02:18]	<lunar>	what i need to do  to play the mp3files?
[neutral]	[02:18]	<variant>	elpargo: of course it's not ideal. it is certainly not moronic though. you just didn't think about it before saying that.
[negative]	[02:18]	<elpargo>	variant, well lets start by breaking totem, second it's not permanent, and third is misleading
[negative]	[02:18]	<Jordan_U>	variant, Because automated things will try to pass arguments to mplayer thinking it's totem

[negative]	[02:19]	<ajehuk>	elpargo - does what was asked though - someone with more of a GUI method should offer analternative tho
[negative]	[02:19]	<variant>	elpargo: not at all
[negative]	[02:19]	<nowisn>	its saying i need to allocate space for a swap and 2 gig for primary
[negative]	[02:19]	<nowisn>	does this not create it on its own
[neutral]	[02:19]	<snowpunk98>	variant, Thank you that did it and VLC looks a lot better
[neutral]	[02:19]	<Jordan_U>	variant, The gnome whatever that plays removable media like DVD's when inserted
[negative]	[02:19]	<variant>	elpargo: if you can offer an alternative that isin't laborious and annoying please do
[neutral]	[02:19]	<Jordan_U>	"variant, It will pass ""%M"" to mplayer"

[negative]	[02:20]	<variant>	Jordan_U: mplayer is not even part of the quesiton or solution so what are you meaning?
[positive]	[02:20]	<elpargo>	variant, change each file, it's a one time thing while your will break a lot
[positive]	[02:20]	<variant>	ahh.. batter dead :/ finnish arg next time :)

[positive]	[02:25]	<ajehuk>	nowisn yep
[negative]	[02:25]	<Flannel>	koala: Uh, the apache module that does that is enabled by default in dapper and edgy.  I'm unsure about feisty.  But it is most likely enabled
[neutral]	[02:25]	<_lemsx1_>	Jordan_U: nvidia_new is for anything newer than geforce4 ?
[neutral]	[02:25]	<seven5_>	elpargo: any suggestions ?
[negative]	[02:25]	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Not yet... never had an issue, was wondering if something were different about these.. Kubuntu herd installed on my other one without issue
[negative]	[02:25]	<xiven>	everytime i send a message on it, it crashes
[positive]	[02:25]	<Jack3>	so its true ubuntu has NTFS read/write?
[negative]	[02:25]	<boricua>	on the console where do i see all the pkgs installed
[neutral]	[02:25]	<underwatercow>	can you unmount a drive you are using though?
[neutral]	[02:25]	<tmbg37>	hi, I was wondering if anyone's been able to get a belkin 802.11g card or other rt61 device working on feisty
[neutral]	[02:25]	<jrib>	Jack3: yes, if you isntall ntfs-3g
[neutral]	[02:25]	<Flannel>	Jack3: in feisty, yes.  You just have to enable it
[negative]	[02:25]	<johnsonwe>	ajehuk - I'll check back in - something came up here.  Later!
[neutral]	[02:25]	<elpargo>	seven5_, get rid of automatix and use the real package manager.
[negative]	[02:25]	<Jack3>	thats pretty cool
[neutral]	[02:25]	<magnetron>	boricua: aptitude
[neutral]	[02:25]	<ajehuk>	Jack3 yeap, not sure how stable it is att
[neutral]	[02:25]	<eck>	underwatercow: no
[positive]	[02:25]	<xiven>	"It has a ""core dump"".."
[negative]	[02:25]	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, wait... there's no open as in preference
[negative]	[02:25]	<seven5_>	elpargo: ok i'll give it a go
[neutral]	[02:26]	<jorge_>	Flannel, enable it by installing ntfs-3g?
[neutral]	[02:26]	<eck>	underwatercow: you would use a live cd or run it from another partition
[negative]	[02:26]	<underwatercow>	eck: so how would I resize my linux partition?
[negative]	[02:26]	<Jack3>	hmm, its not that crap where you have to replace a blank file to write to it , is it?
[neutral]	[02:26]	<magnetron>	ubuntu_noob: if you click a media file it is
[negative]	[02:26]	<underwatercow>	eck: ok, makes sense
[positive]	[02:26]	<underwatercow>	eck: thanks
[neutral]	[02:26]	<ajehuk>	johnsonwe - kk
[positive]	[02:26]	<koala>	and 1 last thing (i hope) :) -- what is the correct term \ command to install a media player software, for winam
[negative]	[02:26]	<koala>	winamp* movie sort of buzz?
[negative]	[02:26]	<eck>	underwatercow: the ubuntu install cd has gparted on it, so you can just use that one
[positive]	[02:26]	<latoo>	underwatercow: just reboot with the live cd, partition manager is in the menu
[neutral]	[02:26]	<ubuntu_noob>	magnetron, lolz

[negative]	[02:26]	<kalifornia909>	anyone install to blank raid array
[negative]	[02:26]	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: so here's what I suggest then (if Kubuntu was able to install okay)...install Kubuntu Feisty from CD and then add the ubunt-desktop package (that will pull in Gnome, etc.)....see if that works for you
[positive]	[02:26]	<xiven>	stuff like that is what it says when it crashes
[neutral]	[02:26]	<elpargo>	koala, winamp doesn't exists in unix,
[neutral]	[02:27]	<boricua>	magnetron: is there a way to just ls all the pkgs or another way without jusing an app
[negative]	[02:27]	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - are you talking software raid or actual hardware?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<magnetron>	boricua: aptitude
[negative]	[02:27]	<koala>	i know, i mean like a media player\music player like it, ii think the codecs maybe
[neutral]	[02:27]	<ciscosurfer>	jestre: meant ubuntu-desktop NOT ubunt-desktop
[negative]	[02:27]	<underwatercow>	eck, latoo: if I use the live CD, gparted will see my drives automatically?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<_lemsx1_>	Jordan_U: disregard my question. i found the answer
[neutral]	[02:27]	<elpargo>	koala, google for audio players they are 100s
[negative]	[02:27]	<Flannel>	jorge_: no... uh, some other package.  ntfs-config, I believe.
[neutral]	[02:27]	<latoo>	underwatercow: yes
[negative]	[02:27]	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Okay...  otherwise I can do a normal upgrade via the upgrade-manager if I have to
[positive]	[02:27]	<underwatercow>	latoo: awesome, thanks...
[negative]	[02:27]	<jorge_>	Flannel, ok, cool.
[negative]	[02:27]	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Just that this'll be the third upgrade like that on this machine, and I wanted to start fresh
[negative]	[02:27]	<elpargo>	koala, xmms is old but it resembles winamp3 although currently they are much better alternatives
[neutral]	[02:27]	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Thanks for the ideas
[positive]	[02:27]	<koala>	for example? :)
[negative]	[02:28]	<eck>	xiven: if you are feeling ambitious you can try to strace it and see what is crashing it
[negative]	[02:28]	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: if you do an upgrade, then read the documentation that ubuntu.com has provided...it explains the correct process you should follow to upgrade successfully
[negative]	[02:28]	<underwatercow>	Has anyone else noticed that most of Vista's new features are from Linux and Mac, but implemented in a worse way?
[positive]	[02:28]	<jorge_>	anyone have a nice howto on getting vmware server working under feisty?
[positive]	[02:28]	<elpargo>	koala, google it :)
[neutral]	[02:28]	<ciscosurfer>	Jestre: sure! any time!
[negative]	[02:28]	<boricua>	magnetron: i dont like apititude is there another way i can look like thru a dir
[positive]	[02:28]	<eck>	xiven: probably one of the libraries it is using is borked, since it works for me
[negative]	[02:28]	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Yeah, about the same as the Dapper -> Edgy upgrade I did on it
[negative]	[02:28]	<underwatercow>	jorge_: it's not too hard, I can tell you how
[neutral]	[02:28]	<xiven>	HAH
[positive]	[02:28]	<Jestre>	ciscosurfer: Thanks again
[negative]	[02:28]	<xiven>	Figured it out
[neutral]	[02:28]	<xiven>	"IT was ""sounds"""
[neutral]	[02:28]	<jorge_>	underwatercow: I'm listening
[negative]	[02:28]	<elpargo>	koaL, no tons of articles comparing them on google.
[negative]	[02:28]	<mastroDani>	"hi there, i've upgraded Ubuntu to feisty yesterday: during the installation it tried to configure MD Array (RAID) on my laptop (???). at the end i rebooted and i found a black screen.. the nvidia proprietary driver didn't work anymore. no way to get them work.. i temporary switched to ""nv"" driver waiting a solution.. plus the system is became very slow: the load of the system it's always more then 2 and often go to"
[negative]	[02:28]	<mastroDani>	5..... (even if i only install something through apt-get).. plus my hard drive was in /dev/hda.. now it is in /dev/sda.. it's not a SCSI disk.. so why this happened? i didn't like this!
[neutral]	[02:28]	<latoo>	boricua: look through a dir?
[negative]	[02:28]	<underwatercow>	jorge_: it's going to be a quick lesson though as I need to go
[neutral]	[02:28]	<magnetron>	boricua: aptitude is curses-based
[positive]	[02:28]	<xiven>	Obviously its caling aplay to play the sounds was screwing up all kinds of stuff, causing a crash
[neutral]	[02:29]	<jorge_>	underwatercow, shot
[neutral]	[02:29]	<nibsa1242>	Hello, I need some help. My computer hardlocked during upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04. Upon reboot it says:

[neutral]	[02:29]	<jorge_>	*shoot
[negative]	[02:29]	<underwatercow>	you want the server, right?

[neutral]	[02:29]	<jorge_>	underwatercow, yup
[neutral]	[02:29]	<xiven>	I feel smart now hehe
[neutral]	[02:29]	<underwatercow>	jorge_: You have to download the server from the website
[neutral]	[02:29]	<ajehuk>	koaL - for audio amarok is nice for video gxine is quite nice (but now people will disagree with me..)
[negative]	[02:29]	<xiven>	I figured it out in 5 minutes

[positive]	[02:29]	<koaL>	time 2 restart, thanks aje ;)
[neutral]	[02:29]	<eck>	mastroDani: remove the splash and quiet option from the grub line, boot it up, and see what is taking it so long

[neutral]	[02:30]	<neilmorrow>	hi all

[negative]	[02:31]	<nibsa1242>	I just need some help... how do I fix my upgrade?
[positive]	[02:31]	<underwatercow>	jorge_: if it has an error when you run the config, you'll probably have to download the vmware-any-any-update109.tar.gz
[neutral]	[02:31]	<neilmorrow>	anyone running 7.04 on apple hardware?
[neutral]	[02:31]	<eck>	mastroDani: check your log files, esp /var/log/messages

[neutral]	[02:31]	<mava>	Hola necesito ayuda.... alguien disponible?
[negative]	[02:31]	<J-_>	Just install feisty, and man.. the sources list is already messed up. I cannot download any packages I want, just used source-o-matic to try and fix the problem and the PGP keys, I don't know how to add, it shows an example. But, it says the keys won't go in.

[negative]	[02:31]	<underwatercow>	jorge_:It has a runme.pl script that will fix the errors and let it install correctly
[negative]	[02:31]	<Jenn>	how do I edit my grub boot load manager in ubuntu?
[positive]	[02:31]	<eck>	mastroDani: also, the renaming of the disk was the change to libata, see this for details @HLINK

[negative]	[02:37]	<Kamaria>	How do I move my MBR from one disc to the other?
[negative]	[02:37]	<radioaktivstorm>	elpargo, would you happen to have any idea why i cannot add another desktop user to my computer? i just upgrated to fiesty this afternoon...there were a few errors
[neutral]	[02:37]	<eck>	Kamaria: because you would just be able to boot up with the old settings and fix any mistakes you made
[neutral]	[02:37]	<Kamaria>	Hard disc, that is.
[negative]	[02:37]	<elpargo>	cables, most programs haven't been tested enough other then that no it's performance is great
[positive]	[02:37]	<kalifornia909>	will gparted set a raid array ubuntu will recognize
[negative]	[02:37]	<latoo>	sooti: everyone has problems with compiz, it's alpha
[negative]	[02:37]	<Pie-rate>	i'd need to take my damn keyboard apart though =/
[negative]	[02:37]	<cables>	Pie-rate, I didn't notice typing speed improvements, but i didn't have sore hands as often
[negative]	[02:37]	<ryanakca>	magnetron: that doesn't help me.
[negative]	[02:37]	<cables>	Pie-rate, no, just do it in software
[negative]	[02:37]	<Jenn>	on my grub boot loader - there is kernel generic and kernel 386. What's the deal here? Only Kernel generic works for me. Should I remove kernel 386?
[positive]	[02:37]	<elpargo>	radioaktivstorm, well errors happen :)
[negative]	[02:37]	<eck>	Kamaria: you can't do that (well you _can_ but don't want to) because hte MBR stores the partition table
[neutral]	[02:37]	<Pie-rate>	then the key labels will be wrong
[negative]	[02:38]	<cables>	Pie-rate, it's actually easier to learn if you're forced to not look at the keys...
[negative]	[02:38]	<ryanakca>	magnetron: I don't have a monitor on my server, and I can't ssh into it. network on it is dead. how do I recover? pull the plug?
[neutral]	[02:38]	<Pie-rate>	orly?
[neutral]	[02:38]	<cables>	Pie-rate, but you're planning to learn to touch-type on Dvorak anyway, it shouldn't matter
[positive]	[02:38]	<cables>	elpargo, thank you
[negative]	[02:38]	<magnetron>	ryanakca: maybe you accidently made a rule to prohibit network traffic...
[negative]	[02:38]	<seven5_>	elpargo: no, this is the first time i've actually even installed a gui onto this computer, it used to just be a server, its got an nforce chipset and a geforce 6 card on board. the video files have been played tons on other computers and my xbmc
[positive]	[02:38]	<latoo>	ryanakca: serial cable? :-)
[negative]	[02:38]	<boricua>	ryanakca: hit the monitor with a bat
[negative]	[02:38]	<break_>	is there a place where i could download feisty at least a little faster than 100 KB/sec??
[neutral]	[02:38]	<cables>	break_, bittorrent
[positive]	[02:38]	<ryanakca>	magnetron: sudo iptables -F         flushes all the iptables rules
[neutral]	[02:38]	<break_>	the tracker times out
[negative]	[02:39]	<shoot^>	fellas, i have a Sony Erricson w810i, and under windows i tend to back up all my text messages etc to my pc. is there any software that lets you do stuff like that on linux?
[negative]	[02:39]	<magnetron>	ryanakca: don't know if it will reset the filters on reboot
[positive]	[02:39]	<elpargo>	ryanakca, well that is not a server :) and I suggest you attach a monitor cause that's the only way your getting into that box.
[negative]	[02:39]	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - good thats the hardware doing the raid...
[negative]	[02:39]	<cables>	break_, use uTorrent in Wine or Azureus and you don't need a tracker.
[negative]	[02:39]	<Kamaria>	eck: Okay then, lol. What I'm trying to do right now is install Windows on the other hard disk, but I read on a forum that Windows tends not to like Linux's boot information and well...the install process crashes every time I try to boot from CD.
[negative]	[02:39]	<elpargo>	break_, you are aware of how many people are trying to get that? 100kb is supper fast right now
[neutral]	[02:39]	<break_>	i'm on windows.
[neutral]	[02:39]	<cables>	Sun JRE is over 100 mb installed? Wow.
[negative]	[02:39]	<Kamaria>	I'm thinking I might end up having to format Linux again.
[negative]	[02:39]	<break_>	and if i didnt need a tracker, wouldnt it be downloading?
[negative]	[02:39]	<NemesisD>	ok guys, for some reason when I use the Metacity window manager, i can play videos fine, but opening ANY video file whilst running Beryl causes the video to open then close abruptly
[positive]	[02:39]	<eck>	Kamaria: it is fairly straightforward to reinstall grub after installing windows. Booting from a Cd is separate from grub
[negative]	[02:40]	<break_>	ive had the torrent going for almost 20 minutes now
[negative]	[02:40]	<xiven>	How well do I have to know C/C++/ect to write some code for the open source?
[positive]	[02:40]	<sooti>	try it from different tracker, break. from the right source feisty has a lot of seeders
[positive]	[02:40]	<magnetron>	elpargo: or maybe it is a very secure server? tight firewall... =)
[negative]	[02:40]	<elpargo>	Kamaria, windows will probably kill your grub, stupid system...
[neutral]	[02:40]	<latoo>	break_: 100K isn't downloading?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<cables>	break_, you need to use a client that can work without a tracker. Like Azureus or uTorrent.
[neutral]	[02:40]	<boricua>	cables:agree huge
[negative]	[02:40]	<xiven>	If I can write a chat server...do I know the language well enough?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<break_>	i'm using utorrent
[neutral]	[02:40]	<cables>	boricua, agree huge with what?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<cables>	break_, is DHT enabled?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<kbrooks>	xiven: no.
[negative]	[02:40]	<Kamaria>	So I take it that it would be a good idea to install Windows on my first HD, and put Linux on the other
[positive]	[02:40]	<elpargo>	+1 for latoo 100kb is very good speed
[negative]	[02:40]	<cables>	break_, you might need to forward a port or something, because i can download fine without a tracker.
[neutral]	[02:40]	<kbrooks>	xiven, there is aa bigger test
[negative]	[02:40]	<eck>	J-_: i'm not sure what it's called off the top of my head, but there's a standard debian tool to test the latency of all the apt mirrors and tell you which one is fastest
[neutral]	[02:40]	<boricua>	cables:sun java i am installlign it now
[positive]	[02:40]	<tripsync>	anyone know how to get ubuntu to recognize my modeline in xorg.conf after I install the nvidia driver, or get opengl support with the nv one?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<elpargo>	Kamaria, yes indeed
[neutral]	[02:40]	<xiven>	What is that?
[neutral]	[02:40]	<J-_>	wth, im getting 404 not found!?
[negative]	[02:41]	<cables>	boricua, yeah
[neutral]	[02:41]	<boricua>	cables:sucks
[positive]	[02:41]	<Pelo>	break_,  be patient , it's worth the wait
[neutral]	[02:41]	<elpargo>	"tripsync, install ""envy"" it will automatically do everything"
[positive]	[02:41]	<Vanuatoo_>	Ok, people. I've got AMD Athlon 3500+, ATI Radeon X850XT, Asus A8N-E. I had Windows XP Installed on my computer. I've installed Feisty in dual boot mode. When I run ubuntu it has random crashes, lockups and so on. I'm running with the kernel parameters -noapic -acpi=off. Does anyone experience the same?
[negative]	[02:41]	<latoo>	tripsync: too little info
[negative]	[02:41]	<boricua>	cables:does that put the plugin automaticly or i need to do the softlink
[negative]	[02:41]	<elpargo>	Vanuatoo_, why acpi off??
[negative]	[02:41]	<Kamaria>	elpargo: Lol, Ubuntu ate my Windows install somehow and I couldn't boot into it. Now that I finally have a second hard drive I'm just going to run them on seperate drives and hope that they don't try to kill each other.
[neutral]	[02:41]	<kalifornia909>	anyone ever use ubuntu on an a7n8x delux mobo
[neutral]	[02:41]	<tripsync>	elpargo: ty
[negative]	[02:41]	<NemesisD>	beryl seems to be preventing video files from playing, anyone thing they can help me out with this?
[negative]	[02:41]	<elpargo>	Kamaria, yes it has a big warning saying it's going to do that
[negative]	[02:42]	<Vanuatoo_>	elpargo: because without it I was not able even to install it
[neutral]	[02:42]	<break_>	DHT is enabled, but it wont work
[negative]	[02:42]	<nibsa1242>	Vanuatoo_: only time I've experienced random crashes etc was while attempting to install Feisty
[negative]	[02:42]	<elpargo>	Vanuatoo_, that doesn't makes sense
[neutral]	[02:42]	<Vanuatoo_>	The install program crashed every time
[neutral]	[02:42]	<Pie-rate>	NemesisD: go to #beryl
[negative]	[02:42]	<eck>	Kamaria: you will still need to use grub to dual boot, unless you want to swap the HDDs around
[neutral]	[02:42]	<NemesisD>	k
[neutral]	[02:42]	<magnetron>	Kamaria: you have to choose if it will eat Windows or share place
[neutral]	[02:42]	<cables>	boricua, install sun-java5/6-plugin, then run sudo update-alternatives --config java and choose the Sun one.
[negative]	[02:42]	<J-_>	anyone know of a good area to download packages atm?
[neutral]	[02:42]	<elpargo>	eck, yea but windows will not kill the MBR on the first drive
[negative]	[02:42]	<break_>	when i tried dual booting, windows always checked the other hard drive for errors
[negative]	[02:42]	<latoo>	J-_: other than repos? google getdeb
[neutral]	[02:42]	<Pelo>	!ati > Vanuatoo_   this might help you out, check the pm window
[negative]	[02:43]	<Kamaria>	Eck: Can I make sure Grub installs on the OTHER hard drive so it doesn't eat the Windows bootloader?
[neutral]	[02:43]	<Angeluz>	Greetings.
[negative]	[02:43]	<elpargo>	i'm confused wasn't 1.6 going to be default in 7.04?
[negative]	[02:43]	<Kamaria>	And then just use the other hard drive as the boot device?
[neutral]	[02:43]	<break_>	unhook your windows drive when you install ubuntu
[neutral]	[02:43]	<cables>	elpargo, 1.6 what?
[neutral]	[02:43]	<kbrooks>	elpargo, 1.6 what?
[positive]	[02:43]	<cables>	:)
[neutral]	[02:43]	<Jenn>	what is the difference between Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.20-15-386 and Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.20-15-generic?
[positive]	[02:43]	<Kevin>	Kamaaria, you can always fix the windows bootloader
[positive]	[02:43]	<elpargo>	:p java don't you follow the messages
[negative]	[02:43]	<eck>	Kamaria: i'm not sure if it's possible in the graphical installer -- if you can skip the bootloader install step you can run the grub install command manually and make sure it goes to the right place
[neutral]	[02:43]	<nibsa1242>	just don't use windows its pointless anyway
[negative]	[02:43]	<J-_>	latoo: no, I mean an area (part of the world) it seems the default canadian repos are not working?
[neutral]	[02:43]	<emet>	does grub-install come with ubuntu
[positive]	[02:44]	<cables>	elpargo, both are available i believe
[neutral]	[02:44]	<latoo>	Kamaria: you don't need the windows bootloader. grub can load both
[negative]	[02:44]	<mastroDani>	"eck, if you written something else i loosed it... i was checking /var/log/messages as you told me.. i checked the last boot... the disk seems to be detected as SCSI, simply.. i'm sure it isn't... the graphic card is recognised as nVidia GeForce 420 Go (right), and than it say that it's supported by the ""legacy"" drivers.. on ubuntu 6.10 my card just work with NOT legacy driver..!!!"
[negative]	[02:44]	<darx>	where is the mount point for windows shares?
[positive]	[02:44]	<Kevin>	Kamaria you can always fix the windows bootloader
[negative]	[02:44]	<Angeluz>	How do I scan my tv-card for channels with TVtime?
[positive]	[02:44]	<elpargo>	cables, I remember reading they will default to 1.6
[negative]	[02:44]	<Pelo>	Jenn,  generic is a bogus package that checks and install the kernel you need
[negative]	[02:44]	<Kamaria>	I'll figure it out.
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Oni-Dracula>	soooo upgraded to 7.04...and reinstalled my nvidia drivers from apt-get and now X is screwed...says module isn't loaded
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Kamaria>	Somehow.
[positive]	[02:44]	<Kamaria>	:P
[neutral]	[02:44]	<robbie_crash>	After upgrading to Fiesty, my slave drive on IDE2 will not work, it's not the drive, it's the channel, it's also 99% not likely a hardware issue as it was working immediately prior to booting into fiesty for the first time
[negative]	[02:44]	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. @HLINK any ideas?
[negative]	[02:44]	<darx>	i can access shares via nautilus but i don't know where it is mounted under filesystem
[neutral]	[02:44]	<eck>	mastroDani: here is the information about the scsi stuff @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:44]	<magnetron>	!enter > Kamaria
[neutral]	[02:44]	<darx>	can someone help me
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Kamaria>	!enter
[negative]	[02:44]	<ubotu>	"Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the ""Enter"" key as punctuation!"
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Kevin>	Kamaria it gives you the option of where you want to install the bootloader on the summary screen if you click advanced
[negative]	[02:45]	<Jenn>	Pelo: But to use my ubuntu, I go into generic and not 386 because my screen freezes at ubuntu logo screen. Is this fine?...
[negative]	[02:45]	<TFMM>	does anyone know if it's possible to get WPA to work with the Netgear WG111?
[negative]	[02:45]	<eck>	mastroDani: I'm not sure about the nvidia stuff, i've never had an nvidia card
[neutral]	[02:45]	<Jordan_U>	robbie_crash, Can you mount it manually? does it show up in a sudo fdisk -l ?
[neutral]	[02:45]	<magnetron>	!enter > Kamaria
[negative]	[02:45]	<Kevin>	Kamaria, im sorry, not bootloader....I meant grub
[positive]	[02:45]	<Pelo>	Jenn,  yes it is fine
[negative]	[02:45]	<elpargo>	Jenn, you should use generic anyway
[neutral]	[02:45]	<budmang1>	what is the fiesty channel?
[negative]	[02:45]	<mastroDani>	eck, tnx.. i will try the legacy driver as it say :/ i'm a bit skeptical
[negative]	[02:45]	<elpargo>	Kevin, grub = bootloader
[negative]	[02:45]	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. @HLINK any ideas?
[positive]	[02:45]	<darx>	where does nautilus mount network shares?
[positive]	[02:45]	<Jordan_U>	budmang1, Your in it :)
[negative]	[02:45]	<magnetron>	TFMM, do you use ndiswrapper? then probably no
[neutral]	[02:45]	<robbie_crash>	Jordan_U: I can't mount whichever drive is on that channel, it doesn;t show up anywhere aside from in the posting prior to ubuntu loading
[neutral]	[02:46]	<Kamaria>	Okay then, Kevin. I'll have to boot into LiveCD again and hope I can finally fix this. Thanks
[negative]	[02:46]	<Pelo>	imbecile,   saying you were having kernel panick on the live cd would have been simplet,   try the alternate install cd
[positive]	[02:46]	<codeyman>	hi ppl.. is the upgrade process from edgy to feisty seamless.. or am i up for a rough ride like when i upgraded to fiesty?
[neutral]	[02:46]	<elpargo>	DarkX, /media
[neutral]	[02:46]	<budmang1>	Ive updated my new laptop and only haveing some minor sound problems.
[neutral]	[02:46]	<budmang1>	everything else works.
[negative]	[02:46]	<moDumass>	hey all, im trying to enable dualview on my geforce fx5950ultra but when i restart x- failes to start so i go with the backed up xorg.conf file, how would i go about starting dualview?
[positive]	[02:46]	<Kevin>	elpargo thanks for the information i already knew
[negative]	[02:46]	<budmang1>	no sound plays but it sees everything.
[neutral]	[02:46]	<tripsync>	latoo: I installed Fiesty and added a modeline in xorg.conf to make my resolution 1440x900, but after I installed the nvidia driver, it stopped recognizing this modeline and my resolution went back to 1024x768...my dilemma is I want to retain my resolution while having the nvidia driver so I can use programs such as beryl
[neutral]	[02:46]	<elpargo>	codeyman, update-manager -d worked like a charm here
[neutral]	[02:46]	<Jordan_U>	robbie_crash, Does it show up in lspci /
[neutral]	[02:46]	<Jordan_U>	?
[positive]	[02:46]	<imbecile>	pelo, ive installed using this one several times.. also have already tried that with others
[negative]	[02:46]	<Jenn>	elpargo and pelo: I have the old Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-386 and Generic. I want to remove them from my grub screen so it will look much cleaner. How would I go on about doing this?
[neutral]	[02:46]	<boricua>	cables: ty
[negative]	[02:46]	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - you said you could see two drives when partitioning ubuntu (didnt you?) - the software raid configuration happens there
[neutral]	[02:47]	<moDumass>	tripsync read it
[negative]	[02:47]	<moDumass>	sorry
[negative]	[02:47]	<elpargo>	"Kevin, then why this line """" not bootloader....I meant grub"""""
[negative]	[02:47]	<nibsa1242>	Is there any simple way to fix a failed Fiesty upgrade?
[neutral]	[02:47]	<latoo>	tripsync: the nvidia installer probably wiped your modeline. did you re-add it?
[negative]	[02:47]	<Jordan_U>	codeyman, If you are upgrading from Edgy and you don't have a bunch of obscure repositories it should be fine
[neutral]	[02:47]	<sdfasdfawef>	tripsync: what card do you have?
[neutral]	[02:47]	<Pelo>	Jenn,   gksu  gedit /boot/grub/menu.list  comment out what you donT' need
[positive]	[02:47]	<elpargo>	Jenn, open synaptics you will see the packages there
[neutral]	[02:47]	<TheIronChef>	any linux based p2p program ot dl music?
[positive]	[02:47]	<codeyman>	elpargo: well am a bit paranoid... it was a charm during the earlier upgrade too.. but it broke lots of stuff..
[negative]	[02:47]	<knix_>	How does NX server work?  Is there server the computer you want to get to or?
[neutral]	[02:47]	<tripsync>	latoo: it's still there, I checked it again...it's just not loading it for some strange reason
[neutral]	[02:47]	<robbie_crash>	Jordan_U: the controller does, but not the actual drive
[neutral]	[02:47]	<elpargo>	codeyman, yes it did
[negative]	[02:47]	<TFMM>	magnetron, I'm using the out of the box driver which says my hardware doesn't support wpa
[negative]	[02:47]	<ajehuk>	eck - you should know this - do you still get the software raid options when configuring partitions on the newer ubuntu installers?
[negative]	[02:47]	<codeyman>	Jordan_U: I do have bunch of obscure repos :(
[neutral]	[02:47]	<tripsync>	sdfasdfawef: GeForce 5700 Ultra
[neutral]	[02:48]	<duelboot>	SWEET...FIESTY IS ALL MINE
[positive]	[02:48]	<robbie_crash>	Jordan_U: it shows up (I think) as 02:0c.0 RAID bus controller: <pci_lookup_name: buffer too small> (rev 11)
[neutral]	[02:48]	<elpargo>	TFMM, does it?
[neutral]	[02:48]	<ajehuk>	kalifornia909 - if you have alittle time I'll grab a box and run through it with you...
[negative]	[02:48]	<latoo>	"I have probs with nvidia driver atm too. I think there's some ""NoCheck..."" settings changes but not sure"

[negative]	[02:48]	<duelboot>	running fiesty on this box and currently installing on another...life is good
[negative]	[02:48]	<codeyman>	elpargo: So nothing this time right...?
[negative]	[02:48]	<eck>	ajehuk: i don't know, i don't use software raid
[neutral]	[02:48]	<nibsa1242>	deulboot you are lucky
[negative]	[02:48]	<duelboot>	elpargo, I know that, but you missed the point...sorry

[negative]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	budmang1,  double click the sound icon and make sure nothing is muted
[negative]	[02:49]	<latoo>	tripsync: I have some vertsync issue with mine too. I think there's some extra settings to disable with the nvidia driver but not sure
[negative]	[02:49]	<boricua>	nibsa1242: my advice reinstall

[neutral]	[02:56]	<Hubris>	I've managed to downgrade my VNC server so it now accepts incoming sessions....when it comes to a login prompt, it doesn't accept my ID/pass - is there somewhere I need to approve users to use VNC?

[neutral]	[02:56]	<nibsa1242>	Malachi: the ones specific to open office
[negative]	[02:56]	<robbie_crash>	elpargo: it worked fine under edgy, then after the upgrade to feisty it stopped. The master on that channel works, with either disk that I put on it, so I know it's not the disk. It doesn't show up under sudo fdisk -l, doesn't show up in hardware information, doesn't show up under gparted, it seems that as soon as ubuntu loads, the slave channel just stops
[negative]	[02:56]	<eck>	underwatercow: as long as sshd is running

[negative]	[02:57]	<robbie_crash>	elpargo: there's no error, the disk just doesn't exist
[positive]	[02:57]	<ajehuk>	Malachi - fyi the command to lauch open office wirter is oowriter
[negative]	[02:57]	<magnetron>	underwatercow: the COMPUTER isn't logged out, the user is

[neutral]	[02:57]	<Malachi>	ajehuk: oowriter isn't installed, it says.
[negative]	[02:57]	<tom_>	Malachi: what does it actually say in the terminal
[negative]	[02:57]	<asooo>	Tom, thank you,but when i just type that,it just give me a code name 2.6.17-11-generic,where is the i686?
[negative]	[02:57]	<eck>	underwatercow: i suppose it could be done for something like VNC if someone sat down and wrote a PAM policy
[negative]	[02:57]	<tom_>	Malachi: are there any error codes or anything
[neutral]	[02:57]	<Malachi>	The program 'oowriter' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing:

[negative]	[03:00]	<tom_>	asooo: hmm ok how come you want that kernel, just for performance?
[negative]	[03:00]	<ajehuk>	elpargo - no but if the component is not isntalled you need to install it
[neutral]	[03:00]	<tom_>	FernLujan: what 3d card do you have
[neutral]	[03:00]	<elpargo>	Malachi, can you open a new shell and try there

[neutral]	[03:01]	<Malachi>	elpargo: Or try it under sudo?
[neutral]	[03:01]	<FernLujan>	tom_: yes, in the restricted drivers manager, and everything was installed properl

[positive]	[03:01]	<ataylor>	worked perfectly fine under 6.10
[negative]	[03:01]	<eck>	mastroDani: the load is basically the average numbre of processes in the running state, so you might be able to find out what is driving the load up by looking for those processes
[negative]	[03:01]	<tom_>	ataylor: what do you mean slow
[neutral]	[03:01]	<Malachi>	elpargo: Or what?
[negative]	[03:01]	<mastroDani>	eck, what's pdflush?
[negative]	[03:01]	<elpargo>	Malachi, bash just another instance
[neutral]	[03:01]	<tom_>	FernLujan: so are you sure you have 3d support
[negative]	[03:01]	<ataylor>	takes up to 30 seconds for web pages to load
[neutral]	[03:01]	<elpargo>	 robbie_crash maybe there is a change in dbus that's causing your drive not to be found
[positive]	[03:01]	<mjr>	FernLujan, actually, I think you shouldn't install the restricted drivers for that particular card (or none of the ATI cards <x1000)

[positive]	[03:01]	<verma>	doing a full upgrade on a beta system will upgrade to 7.04 release .. right?
[negative]	[03:01]	<eck>	mastroDani: it's a process the kernel spawns to write data out to the hard disk. this was a bug in the 2.6.17 kernel

[neutral]	[03:02]	<Malachi>	elpargo: Still nothing
[negative]	[03:02]	<tom_>	FernLujan: ok type this in a terminal
[neutral]	[03:02]	<FernLujan>	mjr: so I just disable the restricted drivers I recently installed?
[negative]	[03:02]	<mjr>	FernLujan, might've been something else wrong with your xorg.conf then, but I don't know how effect-friendly Feisty configures it by default
[neutral]	[03:02]	<elpargo>	Malachi, open up synaptics and reinstall openoffice package (the whole thing)
[neutral]	[03:02]	<ddwagnz>	hi ho
[negative]	[03:03]	<eck>	mastroDani: I suppose it could be
[positive]	[03:03]	<bofh80>	fenris, that only happens to the open ones, close open a new app / window
[negative]	[03:03]	<nibsa1242>	I have to use the restriced driver with my X800... but I think anything lower then X700 the free driver is as good or better
[neutral]	[03:03]	<FernLujan>	mjr: do you think it's possible for me to get beryl working on my desktop with this videocard?
[negative]	[03:03]	<Malachi>	elpargo: Yeah, I'm about to do that.
[neutral]	[03:03]	<FernLujan>	tom_: I'm ready
[neutral]	[03:03]	<tom_>	FernLujan: probably
[negative]	[03:03]	<mjr>	FernLujan, anyway, I tried, successfully, the effects on my radeon x850 and free drivers, after tinkering a bit with my (legacy) xorg.conf
[negative]	[03:03]	<mastroDani>	eck, how can i move up-down the list on top?
[neutral]	[03:03]	<mjr>	FernLujan, yes
[positive]	[03:03]	<fenris>	bofh80: doesnt help... i even logged out and in again
[negative]	[03:03]	<mastroDani>	"eck, with ""top"" i mean the program"
[negative]	[03:03]	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, how about searching their tracker for a bug report
[positive]	[03:03]	<bofh80>	the 3d cube desktop is awesome :D
[negative]	[03:03]	<latoo>	FernLujan: if it has 64MB of ram or more should be fine
[positive]	[03:03]	<tom_>	FernLujan: sorry just checking the command :)
[neutral]	[03:03]	<mastroDani>	eck, in that case i have to install a non-ubuntu kernel?
[negative]	[03:04]	<FernLujan>	mjr: How could I go about installing beryl?
[neutral]	[03:04]	<SciOly>	"I'm using Edgy but I have not automagic ""upgrade"" button in upgrade-manager, anyone might know why?"
[negative]	[03:04]	<mjr>	FernLujan, but of course, it's still experimental and so on, so YMMV, and you might have to do something to advance it
[neutral]	[03:04]	<russiane39_>	Hi! Anyone can tell me, where Restricted Devices manager situated in Kubuntu 7.0.4 ?
[neutral]	[03:04]	<fiction>	!lamp
[positive]	[03:04]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[neutral]	[03:04]	<Flannel>	SciOly: is your edgy completely up to date?
[negative]	[03:04]	<bofh80>	fenris, agh, nasty, turn it off :F - what graphics card you got?
[negative]	[03:04]	<elpargo>	SciOly, you need to pass -d to it
[neutral]	[03:04]	<SciOly>	Flannel, yes
[neutral]	[03:04]	<Flannel>	elpargo: no you dont
[negative]	[03:04]	<SciOly>	elpargo, I tried -d, no success
[neutral]	[03:04]	<ddwagnz>	tell me..... with 6.06 is it possiable to create a new partition and install on that partition that you created?
[neutral]	[03:04]	<fenris>	bofh80: nvidia 7800gt
[neutral]	[03:04]	<Flannel>	SciOly: do you have edgy-updates repositories?
[negative]	[03:04]	<snadge>	i've just updated to feisty, how do i enable desktop effects with ati radeon 9550 video/
[neutral]	[03:04]	<Arrick>	!ubuntu
[negative]	[03:04]	<FernLujan>	mjr: I just got linux today, so I don't know how to install things and stuff
[positive]	[03:04]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see @HLINK and @HLINK
[negative]	[03:04]	<mjr>	FernLujan, first you should try to get the basic compiz working, so you have a working configuration. Then worry about beryl
[negative]	[03:04]	<tom_>	"FernLujan: ok type ""glxinfo | grep rendering"" in a console, and tell me what it says"
[negative]	[03:04]	<elpargo>	Flannel, for the dist-upgrade?? yes you do
[neutral]	[03:04]	<scuzzlebutt>	hello can i get help here with installing something, for fiesty fawn?
[negative]	[03:04]	<teem0>	When  using the kboot and the livecd desktop version (PS3 Port) can I type something at the kboot prompt instead of just pressing enter to start the installer instead of loading the live session.
[negative]	[03:05]	<Flannel>	elpargo: No.  -d is only for development versions.  Feisty is final.
[negative]	[03:05]	<tom_>	FernLujan: don't woryy man, you'll get the hang of it
[negative]	[03:05]	<mjr>	FernLujan, then you shouldn't be trying too hard to get up and running with this experimental stuff
[neutral]	[03:05]	<asooo>	is the ubuntu 7.04 have the 3d wm install on default?
[negative]	[03:05]	<bofh80>	fenris, you git. ok....do you use synaptic? search for name nvidia - tell me which one you have installed?
[negative]	[03:05]	<tom_>	scuzzlebutt: what you wanna install
[neutral]	[03:05]	<Malachi>	elpargo, ajehuk: Funny, says it can't be authenticated.

[positive]	[03:05]	<russiane39_>	where Restricted Devices manager situated in Kubuntu 7.0.4 ?
[negative]	[03:05]	<nibsa1242>	ddwagnz you could do that, but you'd probably need the alternative install cd to set up grub correctly
[negative]	[03:05]	<latoo>	"FernLujan: yes, ""desktop effects"" are still unstable"
[neutral]	[03:05]	<LsBlend>	Help Needed!!!

[negative]	[03:05]	<Flannel>	"SciOly: hmm.  What version ""update-manager"" package do you have/"
[neutral]	[03:05]	<tom_>	FernLujan: ok great, that means your 3d acceleration is on
[negative]	[03:05]	<elpargo>	Flannel, ahhh yes sorry that's -c

[negative]	[03:06]	<tom_>	scuzzlebutt: whats hamachi
[negative]	[03:06]	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. @HLINK any ideas?
[negative]	[03:06]	<Flannel>	elpargo: no.  SciOly, -c is only if you're on dapper. (Only to move away from LTS)
[negative]	[03:06]	<FernLujan>	mjr: I know a bit how to use linux, but I'm not an advanced user
[negative]	[03:06]	<Vanuatoo_>	When I start firefox it closes automatically in 5 seconds

[positive]	[03:06]	<mjr>	"FernLujan, compiz is installed, it's the ""desktop effects"" thingy you can't get working :] "
[positive]	[03:06]	<scuzzlebutt>	its a program where you can allow some1 to have control over ur pc to help you fix things
[neutral]	[03:06]	<LsBlend>	any help?
[positive]	[03:06]	<TomBug>	anyone know how i can set up my sound on 7.04 for 5.1, i have sb live! 24bit?
[negative]	[03:06]	<tom_>	FernLujan: when you open up the ddesktop effects thing what does it say
[neutral]	[03:06]	<elpargo>	Flannel, yes he asked for upgrade...
[negative]	[03:06]	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - probably - how far have you gotten (oh and what is your card?)
[negative]	[03:06]	<nny>	evening all.. so what about edgy made udev load my hard drive as hda, but after an upgrade it is now sda.? I have fixed, but i was unclear as to why the new kernel has labeled it differently
[negative]	[03:06]	<imbecile>	hi guys, everytime i try to boot up live disk i get this error.. @HLINK any ideas?
[negative]	[03:06]	<nibsa1242>	Does anyone have any tips for installing a fesh Fiesty install over a Failed fiesty upgrade?
[positive]	[03:07]	<FernLujan>	the composite extension is not available
[negative]	[03:07]	<bofh80>	ohh, is there a HOTKEY for Desktop Effects? On / Off hotkey? anyone?
[negative]	[03:07]	<tom_>	LsBlend: as you can see its really busy in here, if you type everything in one post, its easier to read
[negative]	[03:07]	<nny>	nibsa1242, what failed?
[neutral]	[03:07]	<elpargo>	Flannel, it will hop you to 6.10 and then 7.04 is there another way??
[negative]	[03:07]	<mjr>	FernLujan, anyway, I do believe you should uninstall the proprietary driver first since I don't think it supports AIGLX, whereas the free driver should for your card, and if you have trouble with that, it should be configurable to work, unlike fglrx
[neutral]	[03:07]	<LsBlend>	nowisn
[neutral]	[03:07]	<Flannel>	elpargo: You don't need ANY flags to go from 6.10 to 7.04
[neutral]	[03:07]	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: ATI Radeon X550X, I haven't done anything except install the restricted ATI drivers yet.
[negative]	[03:07]	<LsBlend>	i cant talk to you
[negative]	[03:07]	<tom_>	imbecile: haha did you take that wit a digital camera ?
[neutral]	[03:08]	<fenris>	bofh80: nvidia-glx version is 1.0.9631
[negative]	[03:08]	<LsBlend>	it wont let me
[neutral]	[03:08]	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - noooooooooooooo
[negative]	[03:08]	<Flannel>	elpargo: -c is only for 6.06 to 6.10, -d is only if you wanted to upgrade while Feisty was still in beta
[negative]	[03:08]	<SciOly>	Flannel, sorry... xchat just segfaulted
[positive]	[03:08]	<jason10>	if anybody wouldnt mind, i have a question about mounting a hard drive in ubuntu?
[negative]	[03:08]	<imbecile>	tom_ yuppers.. i couldnt get that box to boot
[neutral]	[03:08]	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: I'm disabling it though
[negative]	[03:08]	<bofh80>	fenris, i do believe you want the one labeled nvidia-glx-new ?
[negative]	[03:08]	<elpargo>	Flannel, well my friend you do at least that's the only way I got it to show up
[neutral]	[03:08]	<imbecile>	<------ creative
[negative]	[03:08]	<nibsa1242>	nny, it hard locked about 65% in... after wating for 20+min and rebooting I get in a CLI with (initramfs) on the left and above that there is a message saying that my root partition can't be found
[negative]	[03:08]	<nowisn>	lsblend i'm installing now so if you need a hand then pm me
[negative]	[03:08]	<tom_>	imbecile: you have a load of shit drawn on your monitor hey
[negative]	[03:08]	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - not an ATI card... I spent about 3 days playig with my 9550 and xorg - the end result was... pitiful
[negative]	[03:08]	<fenris>	bofh80: do i?
[positive]	[03:08]	<cpar2>	good evening all, I suppose we are talking Feisty tonight :)
[negative]	[03:08]	<LsBlend>	i cant!!
[neutral]	[03:08]	<elpargo>	Flannel, even update-manager help says it
[negative]	[03:08]	<bofh80>	fenris, oh yes with that card, oh yes.
[negative]	[03:08]	<Flannel>	SciOly: hmm.  Well, 0.45.2 is the required version.  Try reloading the package list... er, check for updates, or whatnot
[negative]	[03:08]	<tom_>	imbecile: the kernel is panicing for some reason, that means some hardware isnt workng properly
[neutral]	[03:08]	<Flannel>	elpargo: no.  it doens't.
[positive]	[03:08]	<ajehuk>	cpar2 - whats a feisty? :)
[negative]	[03:08]	<FernLujan>	mjr: after I disable the ATI drivers, what can I do to enable desktop effects?
[negative]	[03:09]	<mjr>	ajehuk, well I played 3 minutes with x800 and compiz worked.
[negative]	[03:09]	<teem0>	When  using the kboot and the livecd desktop version (PS3 Port) can I type something at the kboot prompt instead of just pressing enter to start the installer instead of loading the live session.
[positive]	[03:09]	<elpargo>	Flannel, fine in my machine it didn't unless I added -c
[negative]	[03:09]	<bofh80>	fenris, you can use that to install it, it will remove the other one, no other changes should be needed . . . . . . just to restart X or the PC
[neutral]	[03:09]	<Vanuatoo_>	Why firefox closes after 5 seconds? Where can I see more details?
[negative]	[03:09]	<tom_>	FernLujan: why would you disable the ati drivers
[negative]	[03:09]	<imbecile>	tom_ I used to be a graffiti writer.. hehe is there anyway to troubleshoot what hardware is buggered?
[neutral]	[03:09]	<elpargo>	Vanuatoo_, run it from a shell
[positive]	[03:09]	<ajehuk>	mjr - gonna need a new card - - oh and well volunteered to help FernLujan out with his install :)
[neutral]	[03:09]	<tom_>	Vanuatoo_: open firefox from the console
[negative]	[03:09]	<nny>	nibsa1242, you can always to just run the cd again and tell it to install. It will ask you if you want to reformat or even repartition the hard drive during the install process
[neutral]	[03:09]	<scuzzlebutt>	i give up, l8trz
[negative]	[03:10]	<tom_>	imbecile: ummm does it mention anywhere a piece of hardware?
[negative]	[03:10]	<mjr>	tom_, because the fglrx drivers should really _only_ be used if the free drivers don't support your card
[negative]	[03:10]	<SciOly>	Flannel, yeah... I've been checking, not sure if there is some crucial step I'm missing... every package is up to date on the machine
[neutral]	[03:10]	<fenris>	bofh80: does the -new version work with the old kernel module?
[negative]	[03:10]	<FernLujan>	tom_: that's what someone told me to do to get desktop effects working?
[neutral]	[03:10]	<tom_>	FernLujan: no dont do that
[neutral]	[03:10]	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: I'm extremely confused
[negative]	[03:10]	<bofh80>	fenris, err, why what are you doing? heheh.
[negative]	[03:10]	<FernLujan>	tom_: okay
[negative]	[03:10]	<nny>	so anyone know the name of the new and improved network manager? I lost the use of connection-manager and henceforth, my wireless after upgarde
[negative]	[03:10]	<nibsa1242>	nny: I don't have a cd yet... I'm dowloading right now. I was trying to recommended upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 but that trashed my system
[neutral]	[03:10]	<ajehuk>	FernLujan - how so?
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Vanuatoo_>	Xchat also crashed
[neutral]	[03:10]	<nny>	nibsa1242, heh mine too
[negative]	[03:10]	<imbecile>	tom_ not specifically.. at least i dont think so
[negative]	[03:10]	<PurpZeY>	I am seriously consider an Ubuntu install, can someone answer a couple of quick ?s?
[negative]	[03:10]	<bofh80>	fenris, your not booting with the latest availble kernel?
[neutral]	[03:10]	<mjr>	ajehuk, because tom is feeding him misinformation
[negative]	[03:10]	<Flannel>	"SciOly: that's very odd.  Uh, I dont know.  Alright, to humor him, go ahead and alt-f2 then in that paste `gksu ""update-manager -c""`"
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Vanuatoo_>	It says Segmentation fault. Core dumped
[neutral]	[03:10]	<ajehuk>	PurpZeY - go

[neutral]	[03:10]	<fenris>	bofh80: sure i am

[neutral]	[03:10]	<Ax4>	gogoogoggo
[negative]	[03:10]	<jrib>	PurpZeY: just ask, if someone knows, they will try
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Ax4>	gogogo
[positive]	[03:10]	<Vanuatoo_>	Next steps please? :)
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Ax4>	lol
[positive]	[03:11]	<ajehuk>	mjr well that doesnt help...
[negative]	[03:11]	<FernLujan>	ajehuk: had lots of people talking to me, now my head's everywhere and not only did I forget what I was having troubles with. I forgot everyone's advice!
[negative]	[03:11]	<tom_>	mjr: why would he disable his 3d drivers to get compiz to work
[negative]	[03:11]	<nny>	nibsa1242, heh i bet we both have the same issue, but i fixed min'
[positive]	[03:11]	<Ax4>	we're all on the edge of our seats
[negative]	[03:11]	<nibsa1242>	nny it stopped when it said there were 17min left
[positive]	[03:11]	<Ax4>	:p
[positive]	[03:11]	<bofh80>	fenris, lol, why you askin about the old kernel module then? :P
[negative]	[03:11]	<nibsa1242>	nny and my computer was completely locked up
[neutral]	[03:11]	<elpargo>	nny, it should be loaded if not the util is call  network-admin
[negative]	[03:11]	<seph209>	tom_ any ideas on what to google for to get to the audio fix sound guide? I don't know what wiki you are talking about...
[negative]	[03:11]	<mjr>	tom_, he shouldn't. He should use the free ones that actually do support texture_from_pixmap
[negative]	[03:11]	<nowisn>	oh crap what the hell, i got that error agian, says GRUB loading please wait..... error 17???
[negative]	[03:11]	<PurpZeY>	"Well, I've played with the live CD...and I think I am ready to ""convert"" but I was hoping to do a dual boot, any reason that's a bad idea?"
[negative]	[03:11]	<tom_>	imbecile: you could try passing the kernel some options
[negative]	[03:11]	<nibsa1242>	nny I couldn't even ctrl-atl-backspace

[positive]	[03:11]	<fenris>	"bofh80: ""old"" in the sense of ""the one working with the old nvidia-glx"""
[neutral]	[03:11]	<ajehuk>	mjr - you dealing with it tho? Ive been through the most of the variations if anyone gets stuck.  but then none of the drivers really are right for my card so - ah anyway who cares, I boutha third monitor so Im happy
[negative]	[03:11]	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, no it's not a bad idea, plenty of people do it
[negative]	[03:11]	<nny>	nibsa1242, when it load, what kernel is it trying to boot?
[neutral]	[03:11]	<tom_>	FernLujan: listen to mjr

[negative]	[03:12]	<FernLujan>	mjr: so, can you help me get my desktop effects working?
[positive]	[03:12]	<Ax4>	PurpZeY, either or, you can setup a new partition on your current drive, or use a second physical drive
[negative]	[03:12]	<bofh80>	fenris, oh i see yes, the nvidia-glx module is really up to gf3 and gf4 cards, everything above that is nvidia-glx-new i believe
[positive]	[03:12]	<nny>	nibsa1242, you should be able to boot the old kernel or a new one
[negative]	[03:12]	<teem0>	When  using the kboot and the livecd desktop version (PS3 Port) can I type something at the kboot prompt instead of just pressing enter to start the installer instead of loading the live session.

[neutral]	[03:35]	<fenris>	cables: i see three options: emerald, heliodor and GTK, emerald is selected
[negative]	[03:35]	<cables>	noelferreira, there's a burning app built in, but I like Brasero.
[neutral]	[03:35]	<mjr>	FernLujan, oooh, yes, you should change it to radeon
[negative]	[03:35]	<cables>	fenris, try selecting heliodor and seeing if that works better. It's not as fancy as Emerald, but it should work.
[negative]	[03:35]	<noelferreira>	i use gnome cables

[negative]	[03:36]	<cables>	crdlb, it would be very good, let's start
[positive]	[03:36]	<rbil>	cables: and giving the correct answers?
[neutral]	[03:36]	<cables>	noelferreira, brasero is for gnome
[neutral]	[03:36]	<fenris>	cables: doesnt help
[negative]	[03:36]	<hector>	bofh80, i have that to but i use nividia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals to set it
[negative]	[03:36]	<atlantia>	"so.. kernel loads module for wireless card, but nothing shows up in iwconfig and i cant figure out how to ""invoke"" the new network manager"
[negative]	[03:36]	<cables>	rbil, what do you mean by that?
[positive]	[03:36]	<jrsims>	hey, is anything different in XUBUNTU FEISTY?
[negative]	[03:36]	<mjr>	FernLujan, the vesa driver is completely unaccelerated
[negative]	[03:36]	<fenris>	cables: ill try this addargglxvisuals thing
[neutral]	[03:36]	<cables>	rbil, my answer IS correct, crdlb gave it to me in #beryl
[neutral]	[03:37]	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, even with everything as /dev/*dx it still doesn't show the one missing drive

[negative]	[03:37]	<cables>	fenris, it should already be there. If it's not, you won't even see wobbly windows.
[negative]	[03:37]	<moDumass>	any ideas?
[negative]	[03:37]	<rbil>	he doesn't have AddARGBGLXVisuals in his xorg.conf and that's required for windows borders
[neutral]	[03:37]	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, the one missing drive doesn't show up anywhere
[negative]	[03:37]	<mjr>	FernLujan, so apparently your card wasn't recognized as a radeon during install; I do hope it works even so, and it was just a recognition problem
[negative]	[03:37]	<nibsa1242>	robbie_crash I don't know what to tell you
[neutral]	[03:37]	<hector>	bofh80, everything seems to work fine except for the no-window-borders problem

[negative]	[03:37]	<FernLujan>	mjr: alright. Everything you told me is done
[negative]	[03:37]	<Flannel>	SciOly: right.  I'd file a bug and see what they say.
[negative]	[03:37]	<FernLujan>	mjr: do I Need a restart now or should it work?
[negative]	[03:38]	<roler>	how do I turn on the gnome control center in feisty?
[neutral]	[03:38]	<cables>	rbil, I didn't hear him say that he didn't have that in his x.org. My answer solved part of his problems.
[negative]	[03:38]	<linux_kid>	How do I initiate my modem to dial?
[negative]	[03:38]	<Ax4>	moDumass, looks like you either did something wrong in /etc/X11/xorg.conf or you don't have drivers installed properly
[neutral]	[03:38]	<mjr>	FernLujan, restart X, eg. by killing it with ctrl-alt-backspace
[neutral]	[03:38]	<ajehuk>	tbuss - still here?
[positive]	[03:38]	<robbie_crash>	nibsa1242, thanks anyhow!

[positive]	[03:38]	<HasratUSA>	Good evening!
[negative]	[03:38]	<cables>	fenris, okay, so that should fix it. Add the line as rbil says, then save the file, then restart X with ctrl-alt-backspace
[negative]	[03:39]	<Cassano>	whats the Gusty channel?
[negative]	[03:39]	<tbuss>	ajehuk: yeah, did you not get the user and password?

[negative]	[03:39]	<ajehuk>	tbuss - eh no - how did you send it?
[positive]	[03:39]	<cables>	noelferreira, if you use Gnome, then brasero is probably better. I don't know if it's as powerful, but the user interface is very nice.

[neutral]	[03:39]	<h2o>	I checked Flannel, nobody was in the channel
[negative]	[03:39]	<Whiz2>	bofh80: the php mail interface is for sending mail only. It wants to either send from the local server (localhost) ot through an external SMTP server (ISP) The interface does not have the ability to retrieve mail from the server.

[positive]	[03:39]	<nibsa1242>	noelferreira I use both k3b and brassero I like brassero because it doesn't complain when I burn a CD image to a DVD... I've yet to be able to figure out how to get k3b to do so (when cdrecord was the backend... maybe its different now)

[negative]	[03:41]	<bofh80>	Whiz2, hmm, i'm a bit lost, you want to send and recieve mail from this PHP site? yes? and you want Exim to what ? exactly for you
[negative]	[03:41]	<HasratUSA>	deepsa guess what? I'm downloading Kubuntu Feisty Fawn 7.04 and as soon as it finishes downloading I'm gonna burn it, make several copies and distribute 'em in my neighbourhood the day after tommorrow

[negative]	[03:43]	<Whiz2>	bofh80: I want only to send mail from the PHP site. not retrieve. The only reason I installed a mail server on my machine in the first place is so I could send mail using the PHP site without having to do so through my ISP's SMTP server. Theonly reason I want to retrieve any mail at all from the server is to keep it empty so it doesn't use up my disk space.

[negative]	[03:47]	<cables>	diego_, you need to use the i386 version
[negative]	[03:47]	<Ax4>	intelikey, maybe it's hardware related, not software config related
[positive]	[03:47]	<nibsa1242>	diego_ my current solution is to use a plugin for amd64 firefox that allows the use of 32bit plugins I'd tell you the name, but my 64bit box is currently half dead from upgrading to fiesty
[negative]	[03:47]	<thornomad>	lufis ... um ... maybe ... can i change ports ?  i don't konw a thing about torrents ... was just trying it for ubuntu's sake
[negative]	[03:47]	<dominationlll>	I have downloaded Ubuntu, and I have clicked the install program and it doesn't seem to work. It just sits there with a white window
[negative]	[03:47]	<Jenn>	cypuser: what kind of error?
[negative]	[03:47]	<lufis>	thornomad: are you downloading it on windows?
[positive]	[03:47]	<robbie_crash>	even though elpargo is going to yell at me, I think I'm just going to have to reinstall totally, which isn't so bad because I've realized how badly I've butchered a lot of stuff since I first installed edgy. So starting fresh, and right might not be such a bad idea.

[positive]	[03:47]	<intelikey>	Ax4 can you come in kubuntu   there are three others in there with sound issues atm
[negative]	[03:47]	<cedricshock>	thornomad: It'll take about 2 minuites for bittorrent to check that I'm not seeding you garbage.

[neutral]	[03:47]	<FernLujan>	mjr: hey

[negative]	[03:48]	<thornomad>	lufis, no on the mac. tried transmission and the regular bittorrent (Standard) client
[negative]	[03:48]	<dac>	where do you find out if your box is 64 bit?
[negative]	[03:48]	<intelikey>	or any sound expert care to help in #kubuntu for a minute ?
[neutral]	[03:48]	<cables>	nowisn, it won't show up but don't worry, it's going in.
[neutral]	[03:48]	<thornomad>	lufis, transmission says ports are working
[negative]	[03:48]	<Alonea>	ok, when I upgraded I guess the gaim upgraded too, (it looks different) but it does not work.
[negative]	[03:48]	<Alonea>	"It says ""waiting for network connection"" and its been that way for 20 minutes"
[negative]	[03:48]	<ramin>	is ubuntu planning to get more servers and bandwidth? their servers were so messed yesterday, nobody could upgrade, atleast, I couldn't
[neutral]	[03:48]	<reazn>	Crema10,  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[negative]	[03:48]	<bofh80>	Whiz2, if it's on the same machine, type localhost as the name, if it's running on the same network pop the IP or the name of the Server (assuming you have internal DNS running correctly)
[neutral]	[03:48]	<nibsa1242>	diego_ good luck to you... and so you know it didn't work right for some reason until I restated
[negative]	[03:48]	<Whiz2>	bofh80 so how do I do that? for smtp it wants the entire server name (smtp.host.com) but it's local
[neutral]	[03:48]	<lufis>	thornomad: Strange... try manual announcing
[negative]	[03:48]	<nowisn>	it says bad command
[neutral]	[03:49]	<bofh80>	Whiz2, try localhost

[neutral]	[03:49]	<bofh80>	Whiz2, yup if it's on the same machine
[neutral]	[03:49]	<cables>	Taime1, they're slow from all the traffic.
[negative]	[03:49]	<hector>	no window border in compiz, i wonder why
[negative]	[03:49]	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, just make sure you have /home on a diff partition so you don't have to do backups
[negative]	[03:49]	<thornomad>	lufis ... hmm ... not sure how to do that
[negative]	[03:49]	<dominationlll>	Cables: how long does it take to start?
[neutral]	[03:49]	<cables>	hector, go to #ubuntu-effects for help.
[neutral]	[03:49]	<ramin>	hector, get beryl
[neutral]	[03:49]	<madman91>	can someone help me setup my mouse ? After my upgrade to feisty my scrolly thing wont work... so after following many many many guides on google/ubuntuforums i got it to work a little.. help?
[negative]	[03:49]	<Taime1>	so its basically just unreachable because they are getting pounded?
[negative]	[03:49]	<nowisn>	actually its just live cd right now, what is the pass for root
[negative]	[03:49]	<renato>	Hi There... I wonder if is there anyone who could give me a help on How to install ubuntu via ftp... (my cd burner is broken)...
[negative]	[03:50]	<cables>	dominationlll, didn't take that long for me... how much ram do you have?
[negative]	[03:50]	<lufis>	thornomad: It should be an option somewhere... alternatively try rebooting? I don't know really
[negative]	[03:50]	<cables>	nowisn, there's no root password
[negative]	[03:50]	<cypruser>	I get these errors when I try to upgrade Ubuntu. @HLINK
[negative]	[03:50]	<Whiz2>	bofh80 ok, but that doesn't solve the problem of how do i retrieve mail from the server to keep messages from filling up my small HDD?
[negative]	[03:50]	<cables>	!root | nowisn
[negative]	[03:50]	<pi-meson>	hmm, okay, it looks like the package was removed from debian

[negative]	[03:50]	<Supaplex>	renato: what's the current os you're running?
[negative]	[03:50]	<thornomad>	lufis ... okay ... well, i guess it is me somewhere.  glad to know it is still active.  i can try a reboot.  thanks.
[neutral]	[03:50]	<robbie_crash>	elpargo, that's one of the things I learned recently, I'm going to have one partition be / one be /var one be /home and then all the rest set as it is right now
[negative]	[03:50]	<Crema10>	reazn: for example, will I encounter problems with Beryl which gave me so much problems to install in my laptop
[positive]	[03:50]	<lufis>	thornomad: no prob :)
[neutral]	[03:50]	<Crema10>	doing that dist-upgrade
[negative]	[03:50]	<cables>	dominationlll, I've run it on systems like that and it didn't take that long... does it seem to be working?

[neutral]	[03:50]	<LordLimecat>	"how does one install ""GNU""....a INSTALL file tells me that make-ing it requires GNU...."
[neutral]	[03:50]	<FernLujan>	can anyone help me please?
[negative]	[03:50]	<nibsa1242>	nowisn there is no pass for root... you need to sudo xxxxx where xxx is the command to run as root... or you could sudo su (<--- not recommended)
[negative]	[03:50]	<Taime1>	OMG im such an idiot.... i didnt type in my WEP key....HAHA
[negative]	[03:50]	<renato>	Supaplex... I have ubuntu edgy, but I would like to make a fresh install
[negative]	[03:51]	<robbie_crash>	elpargo, I'll probably just keep my /home as it is now, unless there's a reason to not do that?
[neutral]	[03:51]	<Taime1>	nevermind on the repos
[negative]	[03:51]	<bofh80>	Whiz2, does that work? 1 problem at a time lol
[neutral]	[03:51]	<lufis>	LordLimecat: just gnu?
[negative]	[03:51]	<reazn>	Crema10, you have beryl on 6.10 and now you want to use 7.04 and simply upgrade?
[negative]	[03:51]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan what is your problem
[negative]	[03:51]	<Whiz2>	bofh80 let me check... one moment...
[negative]	[03:51]	<dominationlll>	Yes. It works but everything else but the installion takes awfully slow
[neutral]	[03:51]	<LordLimecat>	lufis: if yes
[negative]	[03:51]	<LordLimecat>	thats all it says
[positive]	[03:51]	<Crema10>	reazn: yes sir

[negative]	[03:51]	<Crema10>	reazn: I want upgrade, but I dont want to break anything, especially my beryl
[negative]	[03:51]	<soothsay>	Can someone tell give a quick comparison of apt-cacher versus apt-proxy (or others)?
[negative]	[03:51]	<Supaplex>	renato: not sure on that one. got a usb stick handy?
[negative]	[03:52]	<mojo>	I have a question...  Why is it that I can't seem to get digg.com to load in Firefox but when I try it in Konqueror it works fine?  It will eventually load in ff but only if I retry SEVERAL times.  Very annoying!
[positive]	[03:52]	<FernLujan>	"nibsa1242: well, I followed one of MJR's ""guides"" that he posted a link to a bit earlier. if you scroll up and try to find one of MJR;s messages, he left a link on how to get the desktop effects working by modifying /etc/x11/xorg.conf"
[negative]	[03:52]	<LordLimecat>	"lufis: i am possibly an idiot....it says ""you need to use GNU make"""
[negative]	[03:52]	<mojo>	Or at least someone give me an idea on what I might check to see where the problem lies
[neutral]	[03:52]	<renato>	Supaplex: Yes I do... but my usb key just has 512mb
[neutral]	[03:52]	<wickedpuppy>	mojo, shouldn't you ask this to ff devs ?
[negative]	[03:52]	<LordLimecat>	lufis: but when i use make, it throws a fit
[negative]	[03:52]	<lufis>	LordLimecat: ah, do you have build-essential installed?
[neutral]	[03:52]	<Taime1>	mojo: ff2 has issues
[neutral]	[03:52]	<fiery_cleric>	mojo: proxy server?
[neutral]	[03:52]	<mojo>	wickedpuppy: maybe...
[neutral]	[03:52]	<reazn>	Crema10, 7.04 has desktop effects like beryl with it..
[negative]	[03:52]	<robbie_crash>	elpargo,  thanks! Sorry I feel I have to reinstall. but I really have bunged a lot of stuff up due to ignorance
[negative]	[03:52]	<HasratUSA>	ramin well when i started the upgrade, the 'time remaining' section of the upgrade tool's window was acting seriously crazy. Sometimes it was saying '4 hours 24 minutes remaining' and after a few seconds it said '34 hours and 44 minutes remaining'. What I did was that I simply stopped caring and went to sleep. at around 6 AM in the morning I somehow woke up and found out that everything was neatly done! the upgrade tool nicely cleaned
[negative]	[03:52]	<nowisn>	holy frig is there an idiot ubuntu channel?
[neutral]	[03:52]	<HasratUSA>	up previous files, upgraded old packages, installed new ones and restarted
[negative]	[03:52]	<LordLimecat>	lufius: just overwrote my old edgy, so, maybe not?
[negative]	[03:52]	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: Well, I did everything he told me to do, and now my computer won't load graphically. it says that server x failed to initialize, so all I Have is my console.
[negative]	[03:53]	<steb>	How do I install update the ubuntu kernel from a live CD?
[negative]	[03:53]	<reazn>	Crema10, what i would do is disable the beryl lines you put in system > preferences > sessions
[negative]	[03:53]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan, sorry making eye candy work properly is not something I'm good at it always crashes too much on my computer... oh wait I have an idea
[positive]	[03:53]	<LordLimecat>	lufius: i will now :)
[positive]	[03:53]	<LordLimecat>	thank you
[neutral]	[03:53]	<reazn>	then dist-upgrade
[neutral]	[03:53]	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: now I'm using my ubuntu CD to be on gaim
[positive]	[03:53]	<lufis>	:)
[negative]	[03:53]	<mojo>	fiery_cleric: no proxy, unless my isp has a transparent one i don't know of... but then konq would be hit by that too.  actually, sometimes using TOR on will make digg.com load when having it off won't... though not today
[neutral]	[03:53]	<wickedpuppy>	nowisn, still having your password problem ?
[negative]	[03:53]	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: what's the idea?
[positive]	[03:53]	<elpargo>	robbie_crash, yup you have learn your lesson, resintalling is the last option :p
[negative]	[03:53]	<Crema10>	reazn: 7.04 has effects like beryl!!??! wow! So we dont need Beryl anymore?
[negative]	[03:53]	<Supaplex>	renato: I know debian has a way to install etch via usb key by placing the iso with the startup misc on it.  can you boot from usb?
[positive]	[03:53]	<cedricshock>	steb: Upgrading an existing installation can be done with the upgrade manager (from the running system) or from the /alternate/ install cd.
[neutral]	[03:53]	<fiery_cleric>	mojo: TOR?
[neutral]	[03:53]	<cables>	dominationlll, lol
[positive]	[03:54]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan ok... look I imagine that part of what you did was to edit xorg.conf right?
[negative]	[03:54]	<dominationlll>	cables is my cd messed up?
[neutral]	[03:54]	<ramin>	<HasratUSA> that's great

[negative]	[03:54]	<anarchron>	hey guys
[neutral]	[03:54]	<DagonX>	are Ubuntu servers working?
[negative]	[03:54]	<HasratUSA>	Crema what Feisty wants to call 'desktop effect' is Compiz
[negative]	[03:54]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan and I would assume that before you edited it you make a back up by doing something like cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.desktope.bak
[negative]	[03:54]	<cables>	Crema10, quite possibly.
[neutral]	[03:54]	<cables>	!slow | DagonX

[neutral]	[03:54]	<anarchron>	how do I find the logs for network manager in feisty?
[neutral]	[03:54]	<lufis>	temujoe: it sends it to /dev/null
[positive]	[03:55]	<mojo>	"Taime1: ff2 ""issues""?  where can i read up on that more?"
[negative]	[03:55]	<reazn>	Crema10, as long as you make sure your system is upto date, before you do the dist-upgrade - you should be fine.
[negative]	[03:55]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan all you need to do is to restore from the backup
[negative]	[03:55]	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: no, he didn't tell me anything like that
[negative]	[03:55]	<moDumasser>	hey all, whats the easiest way to make my TV out work on my Nvidia fx5950ultra? I know its quite an old card but it should still be able to handle the load
[neutral]	[03:55]	<cables>	DagonX, go to System>Administration>Software Sources and select another source server.
[negative]	[03:55]	<temujoe>	lufis: and /dev/null = ?
[neutral]	[03:55]	<lufis>	temujoe: basically it's a way to dump something that isn't needed
[negative]	[03:55]	<ramin>	i know, I thought there was a poll and beryl got more votes, so why did they put compiz in instead?
[neutral]	[03:55]	<Whiz2>	bofh80 according to the php interface, there were no errors. i won't know for sure whether i received it for a lil while.
[neutral]	[03:55]	<KalleDK>	!torrents

[negative]	[03:55]	<fiery_cleric>	mojo: ok... um... maybe create a new profie ... dont know really
[negative]	[03:55]	<ramin>	ah

[negative]	[03:55]	<wickedpuppy>	temujoe, /dev/null is a void ... it sux everything up .. for mroe info pls google on it.. basically nothing ever escapes from it
[negative]	[03:55]	<conn>	hi, where do I make a request for a package to be updated via feisty-updates? Network-Manager 0.6.5 was released yesterday and it'd be good to included in Feisty

Yes I know what you're saying! ""I can go to System menu, choose 'desktop effects' and enable/tick 'woobly"
[positive]	[03:58]	<HasratUSA>	windows' and '3d desktop workspaces'. but those are the only two you will get along with some minimizing and maximizing effects as well as some plugins. but again, you won't be able to configure it using a GUI app, whereas Beryl is just complete, neat and comes with one hell of a wonderful GUI configuration manager
[neutral]	[03:58]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan, ok well if you can remember exactly what file that was you should be able to edit it and remove the new things (just put a # or mutiple ### in front of any line you added to comment it out (I think # is the comment character, not exactly sure maybe someone else can help)) OR there should be a command to reconfigure X but I can't remember it

[negative]	[03:59]	<Crema10>	reazn: actually one more question, will I see any performance decrease doing this upgrade, as opposed to doing it a clean 7.10 install?

[negative]	[03:59]	<josh__>	why does it say error to load operating system where grub is suppose to pop up
[negative]	[03:59]	<atlantia>	FYI if you upgrade, and your intel 3945 wireless card is gone, it is because you have to install the resticted modules package, even if yo

[negative]	[03:59]	<Whiz2>	bofh80 ok
[positive]	[03:59]	<Supaplex>	HasratUSA: patches welcome.
[neutral]	[03:59]	<reazn>	Crema10, i did an upgrade rather than a fresh install and it seems to be fine.

[neutral]	[04:00]	<mojo>	HasratUSA: Beryl is a fork of Compiz, and one of the things it has going for it is the config editor (though it is waaaay saturated with settings that should be on 'advanced' tabs).  Compiz and Beryl are re-merging thankfully so the future looks bright.
[neutral]	[04:00]	<cpare>	HasratUSA - doesn't matter as compiz and Beryl are merging
[positive]	[04:00]	<infidel>	reazn, thanks

[positive]	[04:01]	<cpare>	HasratUSA - so we get the best of both worlds

[neutral]	[04:01]	<steb>	anyone: I updated my kernel to feisty and it will not boot.  None of my alternate kernels will boot.  I need upgrade from 2.6.20-15.x to 2.6.20-15.27. Thanks.
[neutral]	[04:01]	<NeoTheOne->	hi all
[positive]	[04:01]	<lufis>	LordLimecat: ah, thats ok... it's a simple process once you get the hang of it, especially with ubuntu's awesome repos
[positive]	[04:01]	<Whiz2>	bofh80 confirmed! The email i just sent from the PHP interface was received at the email address i sent it to
[negative]	[04:01]	<HasratUSA>	reazn i did the same as well. nothing has seriously gone haywire so far lol and i'm keeping my fingers crossed. previously I promised to myself that edgy was all I needed in my life and that I would never have to upgrade to Feisty. however i couldn't just resist it when people went crazy over Feisty and servers got massive hits lol. so i decided to take the risk and do the upgrade
[negative]	[04:01]	<setuid>	What's the name of the app that shows me the volume up/down graphic when I use the volume buttons on my laptop?
[neutral]	[04:01]	<wickedpuppy>	axiom, that means the next version after feisty ???
[negative]	[04:01]	<mojo>	"cpare: my understanding is that compiz dev has been slower to adopt cutting edge stuff b/c they want to get the architecture done ""right"" from the beginning, and avoid the hackish code."
[negative]	[04:02]	<Rolando>	Ax4  Could you paste again the http page for bugs in kernel, Im sorry i forgetit... tks ... please
[neutral]	[04:02]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan I think I found the comman you need. It should be sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg do that from the command line and hopefully all will be well.
[negative]	[04:02]	<bofh80>	Whiz2, cool, just flickin thru some Exim docs lol. Err what ubuntu are you running on that machine?
[negative]	[04:02]	<josh__>	what is up with fiesty and grub
[negative]	[04:02]	<reazn>	HasratUSA, i found there were still a few little bugs in edgy.. that seem to be fixed in feisty.. i'll always stick with the latest version
[negative]	[04:02]	<Supaplex>	renato: @HLINK looks more relavant. be sure to backup your memory stick someplace safe if you need the contents.
[positive]	[04:02]	<josh__>	on a clean install
[negative]	[04:02]	<cpare>	mojo - seems to be, I was reading the same - Novell was the force behind compiz

[neutral]	[04:02]	<setuid>	compiz, blech
[positive]	[04:02]	<setuid>	Works on like 5% of machines
[negative]	[04:02]	<cpare>	mojo - and then the open source community forked it to add bling
[neutral]	[04:02]	<axiom>	wickedpuppy, i'm just not sure if it means the next major release or something less major. as it is, my system will not update to feisty because i don't have 50MB of free space on my /boot partition (only 40MB)
[neutral]	[04:03]	<FernLujan>	nibsa1242: can I do that from the terminal here while using the ubuntu CD?
[positive]	[04:03]	<cpare>	mojo - it will be nice to see them come together
[negative]	[04:03]	<lufis>	LordLimecat: Hm... have you looked in the readme for any?
[negative]	[04:03]	<nibsa1242>	Both compiz and beryl crash on me way too much... but I blame it on XGL since I've an ATI card
[negative]	[04:03]	<josh__>	anyone else have fiesty and grub problems
[neutral]	[04:03]	<lufis>	LordLimecat: generally the devs list them
[negative]	[04:03]	<mojo>	cpare: well actually it seems that a dev employed by novell but he claims to take his own counsel, not 'directed' by novell
[neutral]	[04:03]	<slop>	is there a way to see a log of all the messages that pop up in tty1 during boot?
[neutral]	[04:03]	<LordLimecat>	lufis: ill check again....do i need gcc?
[neutral]	[04:03]	<cpare>	nibsa1242 - I have to agree
[negative]	[04:03]	<wickedpuppy>	axiom, i don't remember ubuntu having a minor release between major releases .. whats the minor release between dapper and edgy ??
[neutral]	[04:03]	<lufis>	LordLimecat: yes, but it's included in the build-essential metapackage
[negative]	[04:03]	<mojo>	cpare: agreed
[negative]	[04:03]	<setuid>	nibsa1242, There's a HOWTO that explains how to get that working with AIGLX
[positive]	[04:03]	<LordLimecat>	again, this is a fresh install...formatted old edgy where i did my early compiles
[negative]	[04:04]	<nibsa1242>	FernLujan, no I think you'll need to boot into the system... or chroot
[neutral]	[04:04]	<setuid>	nibsa1242, @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:04]	<cpare>	nibsa1242 - I have had bad luck with beryl, and compiz blew me up just now on Feisty
[negative]	[04:04]	<HasratUSA>	reazn yes, first of all it's got more faster than dapper and edgy and there is absolutely no doubt about that. secondly several issues, including the most serious one that severely frustrated wireless internet users, are gone now, most probably, and i'm saying 'most probably' because i don't have an wireless card and hence i can't test it but i bet i'm gonna buy one sooner or later now to see if wireless features are now working outta
[negative]	[04:04]	<HasratUSA>	the box
[negative]	[04:04]	<mojo>	nibsa1242: i use aiglx with the opensource radeon driver no problems.  i don't game so the slower fps doesn't bother me for now

[neutral]	[04:14]	<seamus7>	cypruser: I used the Alternate CD to upgrade

[negative]	[04:15]	<mojo>	knix_: yeah, you need the nomachine nx client for linux to talk to the nxserver on the machine you want to connect to
[negative]	[04:15]	<eck>	lmosher: it's really a problem with nvidia. upstream X.org makes changes to X11, and the changes require updated drivers. I guess nvidia hasn't released drivers that are new enough, and their beta drivers must track CVS or something like that
[neutral]	[04:15]	<mojo>	knix_: nomachine is the company behind nx
[neutral]	[04:15]	<seamus7>	cypruser: no
[negative]	[04:16]	<knix_>	mojo, so the server just sits there and directs to the clients?  I know about nomachine, but no one is answering me on there

[neutral]	[04:21]	<Terramel>	TashKavarish : Yes
[negative]	[04:21]	<ep2011>	vox754 what would be the point of  seperate /usr, /var and /boot
[negative]	[04:21]	<HasratUSA>	damian may be you would have to add some more workspaces? i'm taking a guess

[negative]	[04:22]	<TokenBad>	ok been trying to install this new ubuntu and after got the root stuff sorted it goes to mounting the swap part..and says it can't and fails..I have removed it...remade it...2 or 3 times and always get the same responce when I go to install...
[negative]	[04:22]	<eck>	ep2011: if you want you can use LVM and grow out the space later on, but I only use ~6GB for all of / (not including/home) in total, so i'm not sure if it's worth it
[neutral]	[04:22]	<fucter>	slackware.com
[negative]	[04:22]	<HasratUSA>	Son-Riab hell with torrents. get 'em all from FTP
[neutral]	[04:22]	<Jack3>	jordan_u, so i clicked manual, and it takes me to a list of partitoins called PrePare Partitions
[negative]	[04:22]	<damian>	It doesn't do anything hasrat, after I installed feisty was working but now it's not
[negative]	[04:22]	<Jack3>	so i dunno what to do from there
[neutral]	[04:22]	<ep2011>	eck LVM?
[neutral]	[04:22]	<TokenBad>	can anyone help me get this to install?
[negative]	[04:23]	<Stoffer>	do you guys know of an app that preferrably closes another application at a scheduled time?  I'd settle for one that'll shut down my system.
[positive]	[04:23]	<mojo>	damian: you mean with the traditional workspace switcher?  compiz/beryl use 'viewports' and the ws switcher sees them as one big wide workspace.  i have my cube with 4 viewports but ws switcher set to one wkspace
[negative]	[04:23]	<vox754>	ep2011, /boot could hold all your kernels.    /usr is where most applications are installed, actually you may have a 2 GB / but a 15 /usr , /var could hold temporary data like mail and temporary files, also if you wish /tmp
[negative]	[04:23]	<pimpnasty>	Is there a memory adress editor like tsearch or money editor for linux
[negative]	[04:23]	<Hess>	token can you run the live cd ok?
[positive]	[04:23]	<seamus7>	ep2011: i'm on a laptop with 160GB.. I give / 8GB, /home 100GB and Vista 40GB. Works well for me. A new Feisty install with a couple of programs added takes up a total of 2.5GB in /.
[negative]	[04:23]	<mojo>	damian: but the end result looks and operaties like a ws switcher with 4 wkspaces
[negative]	[04:23]	<damian>	maybe I change something in the config?

[negative]	[04:25]	<HasratUSA>	aburton i personally wouldn't care to boot windows after seeing what GNU/Linux has to offer and how it changes one's life. but anyways there is a how-to on how to fix grub after you knowingly mess it up by installing winblows after GNU/Linux

[negative]	[04:25]	<Hess>	thats funny brandon

[negative]	[04:25]	<aburton>	HasratUSA:  I didn't install it after linux
[neutral]	[04:26]	<aburton>	HasratUSA: I installed windows first

[neutral]	[04:26]	<aburton>	HasratUSA:  everything worked fine until I installed feisty over my edgy install
[negative]	[04:26]	<slyfox>	ZombiekE: then you have to either burn a gparted iso and have this disk for future and use it now and boot form it and resize your partition, or boot with the live cd and use gparted from there
[negative]	[04:26]	<ep2011>	okay, im about to do it, i think ill just do / 10gb and /home 80gb, does that sound fine?
[positive]	[04:26]	<mojo>	BrandonG_: there are ubuntu channels for some specific topics, like #ubuntu-effects for compiz/beryl stuff... do a search on the chan list for ubuntu and you'll likely get several hits.  you use xchat?

[negative]	[04:30]	<atlantia>	seamus7, ok so updat: got it working, but it is STRANGE: when i hit f2 it actuvates radio (no light) dmesg complains, saying it should be turned off to work, but than i used iwconfig to set essid, and than turned it off and it worked
[positive]	[04:30]	<TokenBad>	is there a way to scan and repair drives from live cd?
[negative]	[04:30]	<atlantia>	seamus7, i guess my question is, how do i make this p[aractical, i used connectoin-manager in edgy

[negative]	[04:31]	<LordLimecat>	TokenBad: just so you know, you CAN install stuff on a live CD (it gets  installed to ram).....gparted is good for diagnostic
[negative]	[04:31]	<cypruser>	Ubuntu should be more like Windows.
[neutral]	[04:31]	<LordLimecat>	lol?
[negative]	[04:31]	<eck>	Rictoo: i am not even sure that google earth is distributed under a license that would allow it to be put in repositories
[negative]	[04:31]	<HasratUSA>	TokenBad no you got it all wrong. He is just too sad because he bought a desktop with Vista preinstalled in it and now finds out that he would need to shed some more 200-400 dollars on hardware upgrades to even dream of running vista

[neutral]	[04:33]	<Pelo>	!nvidia > keldor if not , check your pm for some instructions
[negative]	[04:33]	<vox754>	ep2011, well I don't think so, supposedly /boot maybe independent and even shared by different distros, because it only holds the kernel and the boot loader, which may work with any Linux
[neutral]	[04:33]	<cypruser>	Compatible with more applications.

[negative]	[04:34]	<cables>	I can't get above 20 kB/s!
[negative]	[04:34]	<TokenBad>	I guess what I mean by scan and repair is like windows scandisk that can scan and repair...even though the disk are formated...it still errors out...and thats all I can think of left to get this to work
[negative]	[04:34]	<rbil>	cypruser: why would one want to run windows apps under Linux?
[neutral]	[04:34]	<atlantia>	seamus7, nm it is there now

[positive]	[04:35]	<vox754>	ep2011, I'm not that a hacker, but I think you should consider /boot also, ext2 100MB, each kernel is 16 MB so you have room for like 6 kernels, it's cool. But the simple answer is you are not wrong, whatever choice you make is the right one.

[negative]	[04:37]	<vox754>	ep2011, remember you also need the swap one, a 1 GB will do
[negative]	[04:37]	<root__>	soothsay: building a router? you mean a firewall? I'm not sure if its feasible with ubuntu. Check out smoothwall
[negative]	[04:37]	<hrp2171>	crdlb, im using what the ubuntu repos gave me.  should i be using nvidia's direct download instead?

[negative]	[04:40]	<Pelo>	Malachi,   I don'T have anyting to suggest behond what is in that guide,  execpt trying with the alterante install cd , you can upgrade from that
[negative]	[04:40]	<eck>	Vessquire: although if you can you would just be best off getting a router that you can put linux on and writing an iptables policy that forwards interesting traffic to another computer for logging/analysis
[negative]	[04:40]	<kingcobra>	eck do you know how to install a device? i installed serialmonkey driver rt2570 for my usb adaptor but it still says rausb0:no such device

[negative]	[04:47]	<mojo>	Where would I make a feature request like this:  when viewing a table in gnome apps the headers let you put the mouse on the divide and drag the column width.  in windows (yeah that os) there is a nice feature where you can double-click to auto-set the width to the widest element.  would i suggest that to gnome, gtk, or is there another place to make such a request?

[neutral]	[04:49]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK

[negative]	[04:49]	<ethilien>	ok

[negative]	[04:50]	<ethilien>	ty Pelo, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't me
[positive]	[04:50]	<atlantia>	zeroday, envy doesn't like feisty apparently, i sued it with edgy, but now it says OS not supported
[negative]	[04:50]	<root__>	paradon: oh...
[neutral]	[04:50]	<crdlb>	hrp2171, did it install some version of linux-restricted-modules-686 ?
[neutral]	[04:50]	<root__>	paradon: i may just do that lol
[positive]	[04:50]	<eck>	mojo: although something similar to that is being worked on for google soc
[neutral]	[04:50]	<dtholden>	work around key ring on start up for wirless?
[negative]	[04:50]	<atlantia>	zeroday, considering hacking the script and trying anyways
[negative]	[04:50]	<rellik>	fiveiron, in the upgrade notes, there is actually another suggested way to do it.. don't recall the program though
[positive]	[04:50]	<paradon>	root__: At least it'd let you use a web browser :-P
[negative]	[04:50]	<brenix>	"malik: the link you sent was for the xmms player..or are you trying to get the ""theme"" theme installed?"
[positive]	[04:50]	<lmosher>	atlantia: yeah envy is not good w/ fiesty for now. I just spend about 3 hours fixing what forcing envy to install on fiesty did to my poor, poor system :)
[negative]	[04:50]	<rbrtoclto>	hi all, I have a laptop running feisty I'm booting using vga=794 without the splash screen or quiet options as I like to check the boot up messages, however in feisty the default console font (this is before it changes it to whatever you set in /etc/default/console-setup) is very hard to read
[neutral]	[04:50]	<zeroday>	atlantia: I think alberto just released a new version not sure tho
[neutral]	[04:50]	<rbrtoclto>	anyone know how to change it?
[negative]	[04:50]	<hrp2171>	crdlb, nope the 386 version only.  though i already had the 686 version of those modules
[neutral]	[04:51]	<atlantia>	lmosher, lol thanks for the heads up
[neutral]	[04:51]	<madman91>	can someone help me setup my mouse ? After my upgrade to feisty my scrolly thing wont work... so after following many many many guides on google/ubuntuforums i got it to work a little.. help?
[negative]	[04:51]	<seamus7>	"dtholden: there used to be something called ""Pam"" which did that ... but it didn't work for me"
[negative]	[04:51]	<atlantia>	lmosher, sorry to hear your misfortune
[positive]	[04:51]	<crdlb>	hrp2171, but you need the newer version, try a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[neutral]	[04:51]	<william>	verma: isn't in feisty ?
[negative]	[04:51]	<atlantia>	zeroday, was hoping for that, let me check his site
[positive]	[04:51]	<dc>	my usb quit working after putting feisty on my laptop, waht gives?
[negative]	[04:51]	<damian>	hey, how do you make the stupid cube appear?
[positive]	[04:51]	<malik__>	so what codecs do i need to install to be able to play mp3/divx/avi/mpeg1,2,3,4 media types.? any suggestion is welcome
[negative]	[04:51]	<mojo>	Pelo: okay... it is actually working in xchat chan list... cool.  it just doesn't seem to like to work on first try, takes a couple times before it reacts.  weird.
[neutral]	[04:52]	<damian>	It worked on m ebefore but it's not working now
[negative]	[04:52]	<lmosher>	atlantia, If I'd been smarter from the beginning it woulda been easier. I was trying to do it from console, but couldn't remember the names of thigns. Finally I booted x with the 'nv' driver and removed/added the correct nvidia packages. It's basically just a version mismatch
[neutral]	[04:52]	<zeroday>	does automatix install nvidia drivers?
[negative]	[04:52]	<Stoffer>	oops...someone responded to my question about an application that schedules the closing of another.  Could whoever answered please repeat it please?
[negative]	[04:52]	<dtholden>	seamus7, its just getting annoying having to put int he key ring password everytime i start up on my wirless..
[negative]	[04:52]	<seamus7>	damian: I held down the middle mouse button (the wheel) on mind and the cube activated for me
[positive]	[04:52]	<verma>	william, is it/
[negative]	[04:52]	<eck>	mojo: this is the project someone isworking on: @HLINK
[negative]	[04:52]	<damian>	yes zero, but ubuntu does it now
[neutral]	[04:52]	<dc>	!automatix | zeroday
[negative]	[04:52]	<ubotu>	zeroday: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[neutral]	[04:52]	<Toma->	zeroday: synaptic installs nvidia drivers just fine
[negative]	[04:52]	<atlantia>	lmosher, ah ok.. dealt with that.. cool i am gonna try his latest installer and see what crappens
[positive]	[04:52]	<mojo>	eck: thanks for that link!
[positive]	[04:52]	<hrp2171>	crdlb, the orange updater icon was already lit, opened it and the option to update the 686 modules was there.  downloading as we chat.
[negative]	[04:52]	<_Codeman_>	I'm having a problem with grub: error 21
[negative]	[04:52]	<verma>	william, well I did not try doing anything with that driver, just assumed that its the same .. may be I should test
[negative]	[04:53]	<lmosher>	atlantia: Did he approve one for fiestly like literally while I was dealing with it? b/c afaik that's the one I just installed
[neutral]	[04:53]	<malik__>	!codecs
[positive]	[04:53]	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: @HLINK - See also @HLINK - But please use free formats if you can: @HLINK
[negative]	[04:53]	<seamus7>	dtholden: yes i agree .... if you manually configure your /etc/network/interfaces file you can have it log in automatically but you won't have roaming
[neutral]	[04:53]	<atlantia>	lmosher, there is a .deb on his site
[negative]	[04:53]	<kingcobra>	is there any way to see which module is running which device

[negative]	[04:53]	<ixian_>	for some reason 3D effects don't work in feisty. they were working right when i installed it but i must've messed something up and now they aren't. i have tried enabling/disabling the 'ATI accelerated graphics driver' and it doesnt make a difference, i still get a 'composite extension not available' error. i have a x850 xtpe. anyone have an idea?
[negative]	[04:53]	<damian>	It doesn't work for me th emiddle button to activate the cube :(
[negative]	[04:53]	<root__>	william: I haven't the slightest what I did but I think I fixed it lol
[neutral]	[04:53]	<hrp2171>	crdlb, gonna restart.  thanks for your assistance.
[neutral]	[04:53]	<damian>	may be i fucked up the xorg?
[positive]	[04:53]	<atlantia>	lmosher, running now, i'll guinea pig it for ya at least :)
[negative]	[04:54]	<dtholden>	seamus7, yes i have tried configuring it so it won't raom, put in the right wireless details, and yet it doesn't work, it worked fine in edgy, but now this network manager thing is annoying
[positive]	[04:54]	<root__>	paradon: sshhhhh lynx is a browser. You'll hurt its text-based feelings
[neutral]	[04:54]	<vox754>	!language > damian
[negative]	[04:54]	<lmosher>	atlantia: yeah that's what I installed.
[negative]	[04:54]	<mojo>	eck: that is cool... though i was really thinking of things like the channel list in xchat, columnar tables with column headers.  but clicking away i found that it does work in xchat, though iirc there are several apps where it doesn't
[negative]	[04:54]	<damian>	oops sorry
[positive]	[04:54]	<william>	verma: I had it manually installed in Edgy and it is still there now.... do you have the ntfs configuration tool in App >> Sys Tools ?
[negative]	[04:55]	<sizzam>	Feisty doesn't seem to have come with /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.    Can I just create those?
[neutral]	[04:55]	<ks1>	sizzam: yes
[neutral]	[04:55]	<Leftmost>	If I'm using Feisty beta, will simply running software update bring me up-to-date with Feisty release?
[negative]	[04:55]	<kingcobra>	anybody know is there any way to see which module is running which device
[negative]	[04:55]	<seamus7>	dtholden: yeah i tried creating two profiles in Networking (manual configuration) .. one for roaming and one for a static ip ... but it doesn't work as expected ... Network Manager seems to work best only with roaming and then of course you get that password prompty :(
[neutral]	[04:55]	<ks1>	Leftmost: yes
[positive]	[04:55]	<Leftmost>	Excellent, thanks.
[negative]	[04:56]	<lmosher>	atlantia: Maybe I did something wrong...dunno. Anyway, for me it threw a version error from 9755 to 963? or something. I had to change to 'nv' driver, use synaptic and installed nvidia-glx-new, REMOVE nvidia-kernel-2.6.20.15... I think that about does it.
[negative]	[04:56]	<sizzam>	ks1: do you know the proper file permissions for those files
[positive]	[04:56]	<LordLimecat>	Leftmost: enjoy your 354 updates :)
[positive]	[04:56]	<dtholden>	seamus7, i just wish it was soo easy like in edgy, where i put in the details, and there it goes, no password needed each time
[negative]	[04:56]	<shigutso>	my mouse is almost-working: scroll ok, but no mouse3 click... in ubuntu 6.06 it worked fine, but not here in 7.04... what's the problem??
[negative]	[04:56]	<seamus7>	dtholden: have you tried disabling the nm-applet in sessions and then configuring the interfaces file?

[neutral]	[05:06]	<Abom>	1.9.7-0ubuntu2: all
[negative]	[05:06]	<eck>	stellaras: no need to dd, just install grub and copy the files over

[positive]	[05:06]	<Abom>	pppoe_dude: will that work fine with feisty?
[negative]	[05:06]	<Rug>	PanzerMKZ: are you trying to do this on a dedicated host that doesn't allow persistant processes?
[negative]	[05:06]	<Cactii>	stellarus: If your bios supports booting from USB just copy the iso filesystem to the USB drive.
[neutral]	[05:06]	<artabrahao>	what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386? To a server whatis better and more stable, 6.06 ot 7.04?
[negative]	[05:06]	<JacktheHomeless>	Dr_willis: I tried just reconfiguring the xorg using sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and any time i choose the nvidia setting the xserver wont start. right now im running using vesa

[neutral]	[05:07]	<rttm>	"""CPU frequency scaling unsupported"" p5b deluxe ?"
[neutral]	[05:07]	<eck>	stellaras: then you would configure grub to run the live cd kernel/initrd

[neutral]	[05:07]	<Vessquire>	Does the guided partitioning hang for anyone else on install?
[negative]	[05:07]	<Vessquire>	I can't get past it
[positive]	[05:07]	<ethilien>	it will be replaced eventually
[negative]	[05:07]	<eck>	Toma-: no, this would be copying the contents of the iso, not installing it
[positive]	[05:07]	<Vessquire>	always hangs at 60%
[negative]	[05:07]	<stellaras>	eck: what is grub ? sorry i'm new to linux
[neutral]	[05:07]	<Toma->	eck: ahhh good call.
[positive]	[05:07]	<eck>	stellaras: it is the bootloader ubuntu uses
[neutral]	[05:07]	<artabrahao>	what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386?
[neutral]	[05:07]	<Dr_willis>	JacktheHomeless,  all i did. was install the nvidia-glx package. and change 'nv' to 'nvidia' in the xorg.conf and restarted X. i diddien use that dpkg-reconfogure command.
[positive]	[05:07]	<rttm>	Vessquire not so much as hanging just very slow
[neutral]	[05:07]	<artabrahao>	<ethilien> what happened with ubuntu-6.10-server-i386?

[neutral]	[05:08]	<aburton>	wonderful- we're on the topic of grub
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Vessquire>	rttm, how slow?
[positive]	[05:08]	<ethilien>	those are the current releases
[negative]	[05:08]	<kingcobra>	eck, rausb0 is not in either ifconfig or iwconfig
[positive]	[05:08]	<Pelo>	Vessquire,  try partitionnying manualy before starting the install,   you can run gparted from the system > admin menu in the live cd desktop
[neutral]	[05:08]	<JacktheHomeless>	Dr_willis:  i didnt grab the nvidia-glx package. I did an upgrade from a copy of edgy that had the drivers already installed correctly.
[negative]	[05:08]	<rttm>	about 2 to 3 min somethimes Vessquire
[negative]	[05:08]	<eck>	kingcobra: check dmesg to see if the kernel is telling you anything useful
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Vessquire>	Pelo, I'm installing the server version... not livecd
[neutral]	[05:08]	<dood_>	is there a way to disable the screensaver from terminal?
[negative]	[05:08]	<Flannel>	PanzerMKZ: @HLINK  that explains how to set it up as a daemon
[positive]	[05:08]	<artabrahao>	<ethilien> what means the long term support?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Dr_willis>	JacktheHomeless,  ive not done a 'upgrade' so no idea what over probpems may be causing that.
[negative]	[05:08]	<stellaras>	eck: is there any web site that explain how to do this?

[neutral]	[05:09]	<LordBrain>	i'm using xubuntu
[negative]	[05:09]	<Pelo>	"Vessquire,   I don't know how to help with that then   except that you can probably launch ""parted"" before the install and try that way"
[negative]	[05:09]	<JacktheHomeless>	Dr_willis:  no sweat man, however, i am gonna try getting that package. worst comes to worst, ill just do a clean install of feisty and start fresh
[positive]	[05:09]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: its supported for 10 years or so
[negative]	[05:09]	<LordBrain>	and I would rather not install gnome
[negative]	[05:09]	<ethilien>	let me check
[neutral]	[05:09]	<eck>	stellaras: I wrote one a while ago, not sure if this is 100% up to date but it should be pretty close: @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:09]	<ceil420>	where can i get Gibbon?

[neutral]	[05:09]	<rttm>	i think its a bug because for me p5b deluxe mb i thought it was hanging but it work after
[negative]	[05:09]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: excuse me, 3 years for desktop and 5 years for server
[neutral]	[05:09]	<Flannel>	"aburton: change ""root"" to ""rootnoverify"" (line 154 in that paste)"
[positive]	[05:10]	<artabrahao>	<ethilien> who will give that support? Is the 6.04 the same as 6.10?
[neutral]	[05:10]	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  or you could spawn one with the proper 'sudo startx -- SOMTHING' command
[negative]	[05:10]	<Stoffer>	"eck, are you familiar with using unrar?  Do I just have to ""unrar"" the file that ends in .rar or do the entire series (r00, r01, etc)?  So far I did just the one and it only gave me a new folder..."

[negative]	[05:10]	<Hubris>	Having a problem with login through VNC....can anyone offer some suggestions?
[neutral]	[05:10]	<stellaras>	eck: i tried @HLINK but when i was at the final step to move the files to the usb the files size was to large
[positive]	[05:10]	<aburton>	Flannel: Thanks!
[neutral]	[05:10]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: no, 6.10 is more up to date
[negative]	[05:10]	<eck>	Stoffer: iirc you do something like: unrar e foo.rar
[negative]	[05:10]	<rttm>	Stupid question i'm running gaim is there a better app for irc

[positive]	[05:11]	<Vessquire>	I use colloquy on mac... not sure if its available on linux, but I love it
[negative]	[05:11]	<eck>	stellaras: how large did you make the partition?
[neutral]	[05:11]	<kingcobra>	eck, dont think so
[negative]	[05:11]	<artabrahao>	<ethilien> to a webserver what is the recommendation, 6.04 or 7.04? What means no support for 7.04?
[negative]	[05:11]	<Stoffer>	eck, yeah, I think in unrar-free the flag is -x though?  It says everything extracted fine, but I get nothing out of it
[positive]	[05:11]	<ferret_0568>	Does anybody know if, with the NVIDIA module, a Dell 2005FPW will work just fine?
[negative]	[05:11]	<_Codeman_>	No one is answering me on #grub :(
[negative]	[05:11]	<LordBrain>	Dr_willis: I do not know if this is it, but there is System -> Login Window, but it seems to require me to know the current users password.
[positive]	[05:11]	<eck>	stellaras: also, i would recommend grub over syslinux, grub can boot fat filesystems (like syslinux) but is more standard and imho easier to use
[neutral]	[05:11]	<ferret_0568>	My laptop seems to always think a VGA monitor is connected
[neutral]	[05:11]	<HasratUSA>	Vessquire do you think it's possible to use MAC OS X's default internet browser in Ubuntu?
[positive]	[05:11]	<Hubris>	ferret - it works fine on my 2405fwp
[negative]	[05:12]	<stellaras>	eck:i followed the tutorial step by step so i did the partition +700MB
[positive]	[05:12]	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  not using xfce, so i dont know its layout/menus. it may be wanting the sudo password to spawn the new x session
[positive]	[05:12]	<stellaras>	eck: ate least i thnk so :)
[negative]	[05:12]	<Vessquire>	HasratUSA, you mean safari?
[neutral]	[05:12]	<HasratUSA>	Vessquire: yes!
[negative]	[05:12]	<Vessquire>	I have no clue
[negative]	[05:12]	<unixforge>	hi, i have a problem. I downloaded the ubuntu 7.04 iso ( not alter. ). And after ai boot the live cd. Is asking me for an user/pass. So the Q: What is the user and the pass?
[neutral]	[05:12]	<HasratUSA>	sheet
[neutral]	[05:12]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: go to pm
[negative]	[05:13]	<dood_>	the problem is that every time the screensaver kicks in, X restarts. Annoying considering I am in the middle of a feisty upgrade
[negative]	[05:13]	<LordBrain>	Dr_willis: you know a commandline way to do it?
[neutral]	[05:13]	<kingcobra_>	eck, dont think so
[negative]	[05:13]	<eck>	stellaras: maybe you need to make it a little bit bigger? you can't be off by much
[neutral]	[05:13]	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  or you could spawn one with the proper 'sudo startx -- SOMTHING' command
[neutral]	[05:13]	<artabrahao>	<ethilien> pm?
[negative]	[05:13]	<HasratUSA>	unixforge: that's NEVER supposed to happen
[negative]	[05:13]	<ferret_0568>	"If I don't use the 'Option          ""UseDisplayDevice"" ""DFP-0""' in my xorg.conf, I don't get anything on my laptop's internal LCD"
[negative]	[05:13]	<eck>	kingcobra_: the kernel should at least have a line saying it loaded up the module right?
[neutral]	[05:13]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: a private chat
[negative]	[05:13]	<eck>	Stoffer: it is e or x (i think no -)
[neutral]	[05:14]	<eck>	Stoffer: the difference is where it extracts the files to
[negative]	[05:14]	<aburton>	Flannel: That didn't work
[positive]	[05:14]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: you should see it in your irc client somewhere
[negative]	[05:14]	<unixforge>	HasratUSA: in vmware works fine. But when i try to do a normal install... Is asking me for user pass// very odd
[neutral]	[05:14]	<ferret_0568>	"After that, the NVIDIA control panel always says that ""CRT-0"" is disabled"
[neutral]	[05:14]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: it depends on what client you're using
[negative]	[05:14]	<stellaras>	eck: so what i have to try is when the tutorials says +700MB i will write something like +800MB  ?
[negative]	[05:14]	<Flannel>	unixforge: ubuntu is the user, there is no password.  But, that shouldn't happen.  Is this ubuntu? or fluxbuntu? or what?
[neutral]	[05:14]	<eck>	stellaras: correct
[negative]	[05:14]	<Stoffer>	eck, well I tried e and it gave me the same thing.  I'm not putting in an extract-to path, but it should just default to the current directory, no?
[negative]	[05:14]	<Linux_>	question. I have vnc server installed on my ubuntu machine. I can't remeber the password for it. Does vnc store the password somewhere or can I reset the password?
[negative]	[05:14]	<ferret_0568>	You could set a user account with no password
[neutral]	[05:14]	<carutsu>	is the channel ubuntu+1 gone?!
[neutral]	[05:14]	<ferret_0568>	Yes
[positive]	[05:14]	<stellaras>	eck: thank you i will try again :)
[neutral]	[05:15]	<stellaras>	c u soon
[neutral]	[05:15]	<ferret_0568>	Feisty got released
[neutral]	[05:15]	<stellaras>	7.04 ROCKS
[positive]	[05:15]	<Flannel>	carutsu: feisty was released.  this is feisty support
[neutral]	[05:15]	<ferret_0568>	It was stable for a long time
[negative]	[05:15]	<unixforge>	Flannel: I tried ubuntu/ubuntu, ubuntu/ , root/root . Nothing works... :(
[neutral]	[05:15]	<Hubris>	Linux_ - you can reset the password
[neutral]	[05:15]	<carutsu>	Flannel thx
[negative]	[05:15]	<ferret_0568>	You could set a user account with no password
[negative]	[05:15]	<eck>	Stoffer: what about: unrar l foo.rar
[neutral]	[05:15]	<ferret_0568>	"read ""man passwd"""
[neutral]	[05:15]	<kingcobra_>	eck, cant find it
[negative]	[05:15]	<Linux_>	how could you reset the password?
[neutral]	[05:15]	<eck>	Stoffer: can you see the files in the rar?
[neutral]	[05:15]	<break_>	AHH
[neutral]	[05:15]	<kingcobra_>	eck its there in lsmod
[negative]	[05:15]	<Flannel>	unixforge: what flavor of ubunu is it?
[positive]	[05:15]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: are you still there?
[negative]	[05:15]	<_Codeman_>	I keep getting grub: error 21 and I can't figure out how to fix it
[neutral]	[05:15]	<Linux_>	Hubris, how would I reset the password
[neutral]	[05:15]	<artabrahao>	<ethilien> im pm too
[negative]	[05:16]	<eck>	kingcobra_: i am not sure what the problem could be, I don't have a ralink chipset. Have you tried the forums?
[negative]	[05:16]	<Dr_willis>	LordBrain,  'startx -- :1 '  should do it. if you login as the user under the console first. i think
[neutral]	[05:16]	<unixforge>	Flannel: ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
[neutral]	[05:16]	<ferret_0568>	"artabrahao: login to the affected user, and type ""passwd"""
[neutral]	[05:16]	<Stoffer>	eck, yes
[negative]	[05:16]	<kingcobra_>	eck, no ill try that thanks
[neutral]	[05:16]	<PMantis>	is the ubuntu torrent tracker down?
[positive]	[05:17]	<eck>	PMantis: it was earlier today
[negative]	[05:17]	<ferret_0568>	How do I set up dual monitors in Ubuntu?
[negative]	[05:17]	<PMantis>	eck, I can't connect to it right now. Can you or anyone else verify (could by my firewall)
[neutral]	[05:17]	<unixforge>	Flannel: i used this mirror @HLINK
[negative]	[05:17]	<artabrahao>	<ferret_0568> I think I did it
[negative]	[05:17]	<p47>	how can I know hich version of ubuntu is running in my pc ?
[negative]	[05:18]	<Stoffer>	eck, I think for some reason it keeps giving me a directory instead of the file itself...
[neutral]	[05:18]	<Flannel>	p47: lsb_release -a
[neutral]	[05:18]	<rever>	Hi does anyone know is there is a binary for the latest Democracy player in Feisty?
[negative]	[05:18]	<ethilien>	PMantis: I can't connect to the tracker either
[negative]	[05:18]	<PMantis>	ugh
[positive]	[05:18]	<aburton>	"Does anyone have a clue as to why grub isn't letting me boot into XP? It hangs on ""starting up..."" Here's my menu.lst @HLINK"
[negative]	[05:18]	<p47>	Flannel: ok thank's
[neutral]	[05:18]	<ferret_0568>	Can I hotplug displays on my laptop?
[positive]	[05:18]	<dtholden>	open xorg command?
[neutral]	[05:19]	<jason_>	just updated to the 7.04 and now my screen resolution is stuck on 800x600
[negative]	[05:19]	<ferret_0568>	I want to know if it's safe, since the NVIDIA control panel has a button for detecting hot-plugged displays
[positive]	[05:19]	<PMantis>	ethilien, thanks for checking
[positive]	[05:19]	<Stoffer>	eck, so now I have 2 directories names just like the file, one within the other, but not the actual file...
[neutral]	[05:19]	<ethilien>	PMantis: np
[negative]	[05:19]	<Pelo>	dtholden,  do you mean   gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
[neutral]	[05:19]	<ferret_0568>	The monitor is VGA, the laptop has a VGA connector, no adaptor
[negative]	[05:19]	<ferret_0568>	Is it safe?
[negative]	[05:19]	<_Codeman_>	I keep getting grub: error 21 and I can't figure out how to fix it
[negative]	[05:20]	<Hubris2>	jason - you can reconfigure your Xserver, it will detect the hardware, and let you select the resolutions you want
[neutral]	[05:20]	<jason_>	how i do that
[positive]	[05:20]	<sdfasdfawef>	ferret: works for me
[negative]	[05:20]	<artabrahao>	ethilien where are you?
[negative]	[05:20]	<kalifonria909>	-if you have too many bootable partitions will that cause ubuntu not to boot
[neutral]	[05:20]	<SeveredCross>	Anyone know if it's possible to link channels in alsamixer?
[negative]	[05:20]	<Stoffer>	eck, you don't suppose that the non-free version would be any better than unrar-free do you?
[negative]	[05:20]	<eck>	Stoffer: and nothing within the directories?
[negative]	[05:20]	<Stoffer>	eck, nothing
[negative]	[05:20]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: I'm still here
[positive]	[05:20]	<TashKavarish>	I'm using a 1920x1200 lcd via dvi, it used to work, I had to send it in for repairs, I put a 1440x900 replacement which worked fine, when I got the 1920 back it works but max res dropped to 1600x1200 what gives? and how do i get 1920 back
[negative]	[05:20]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: I was waiting for you in the private chat
[neutral]	[05:20]	<ferret_0568>	yes, kalifonria909
[negative]	[05:20]	<eck>	Stoffer: I just have the non-free one, and I haven't had any problems with it
[neutral]	[05:20]	<Pelo>	aburton,   is your windows installed on the same hdd as ubuntu ?
[positive]	[05:20]	<SeveredCross>	I'd like to link my LFE with master volume so that when I push the media buttons to lower the master volume, the LFE lowers too.
[neutral]	[05:20]	<Hubris2>	jason - sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[negative]	[05:20]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: but I'll just say it here
[negative]	[05:21]	<p47>	does festy has a problem with beryl ?
[negative]	[05:21]	<larson9999>	i don't know how you guys can see at those resolutions.  i must be getting old
[negative]	[05:21]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: the only real difference is how long you intend to operate the server and how much you would mind upgrading between major releases
[neutral]	[05:21]	<larson9999>	big monitors?
[negative]	[05:21]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: if you want the least hassle, go with 6.06
[neutral]	[05:21]	<Pelo>	larson9999,  glasses
[negative]	[05:21]	<eck>	larson9999: turning on subpixel rendering (if you have an lcd)helps
[positive]	[05:21]	<Meshezabeel>	p47, beryl has problems right now period, it is still only in testing stage
[negative]	[05:21]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: but if you want more recent software, go with 7.04
[neutral]	[05:21]	<larson9999>	Pelo, got glasse.
[negative]	[05:21]	<p47>	Meshezabeel: so, what should I do ?
[neutral]	[05:22]	<Pelo>	larson9999,  try bi-focals
[neutral]	[05:22]	<Hubris2>	TashKavarish: you can either manually edit the Xorg.conf file with  your resolutions....or reconfigure your Xserver, after which it will let you select resolutions
[negative]	[05:22]	<Meshezabeel>	p47, about what, missed what you wanted to do
[negative]	[05:22]	<rever>	p47, I am running beryl on feisty without issue
[negative]	[05:22]	<aburton>	Pelo: Yeah
[negative]	[05:22]	<amicrawler>	my auto paste  stop working any body know why ?
[negative]	[05:22]	<Stoffer>	eck, well I just installed the non-free, and it displayed all of the r's (r00, r01) as being extracted, and it asked to overwrite what I had, but it just gave me another directory....
[negative]	[05:23]	<rever>	p47, I use trevinos git script and compile the git version
[negative]	[05:23]	<Pelo>	aburton,  then I donT' rightly know,  try asking in #grub
[negative]	[05:23]	<HasratUSA>	p47 what's your problem with beryl?
[positive]	[05:23]	<TashKavarish>	Hubris2: ive tried both, the res is in xorg.conf but it wont use it
[negative]	[05:23]	<eck>	Stoffer: the file isn't hidden, is it?
[negative]	[05:23]	<Stoffer>	eck, the file should be an avi, btw
[positive]	[05:23]	<p47>	Meshezabeel: I updated to festy but now I have problems with beryl, beryl shows me the windows in color white !
[negative]	[05:23]	<rever>	p47, however, Beryl and Compiz is merging so not much new going on lately
[neutral]	[05:23]	<Stoffer>	eck, ls -A?
[positive]	[05:23]	<Meshezabeel>	artabrahao: I disagree, I'd go with 7.04
[neutral]	[05:23]	<eck>	ls -a
[negative]	[05:23]	<eck>	err, i guess -A is fine too
[negative]	[05:23]	<unixforge>	can someone explain why the ubuntu live cd is not working ? is it a bug? or what? Is it posible to bypass  the live cd login ?
[negative]	[05:24]	<chipbuddy>	sorry if this is a often repeated question. i'm trying to get avi files to play. can i just go through snyaptic? or is it more involved than that
[positive]	[05:24]	<epotash>	has feisty changed the way it handles ipods, mine doesnt auto mount with an ipod icon when i plug it in anymore?
[positive]	[05:24]	<squitijax>	I just downloaded the x86-desktop torrent, and it gives me a GNOME settings daemon error on boot
[neutral]	[05:24]	<artabrahao>	ethilien nice, and I still trying go to pm
[neutral]	[05:24]	<TashKavarish>	right now its like the nvidia driver is blocking the use of anything higher then 1600x1200
[positive]	[05:24]	<Meshezabeel>	p47, not sure why, can you change it in the Theme Manager?
[neutral]	[05:24]	<eck>	unixforge: what is the issue you are having?
[negative]	[05:24]	<Stoffer>	eck, no, they must have been empty because I removed both with no issues
[positive]	[05:24]	<p47>	Meshezabeel: I had beryl running in my last version but when I did a update I got the windows color white !
[neutral]	[05:24]	<dj-fu>	p47: the white window issue is due to insufficient graphics memory on nvidia cards
[neutral]	[05:24]	<TashKavarish>	but only on dvi, svga is fine
[neutral]	[05:24]	<Pelo>	unixforge,  username ubuntu  pswd blanck I think
[negative]	[05:24]	<unixforge>	I downloaded the ubuntu 7.04 iso ( not alter. ). And after ai boot the live cd. Is asking me for an user/pass. So the Q: What is the user and the pass?
[neutral]	[05:24]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: can you not find the tab?
[positive]	[05:24]	<larson9999>	i'll give that subpixel thing a try although i really think it's my eyes :)

[neutral]	[05:24]	<dj-fu>	p47: what?
[neutral]	[05:24]	<rever>	p47,  you running nvidia?

[neutral]	[05:25]	<Juan>	lomez, #winehq
[negative]	[05:25]	<sinisterguy>	is there any way to map the deskbar shortcut to control-space in feisty?
[negative]	[05:25]	<Vessquire>	how would I partition if I have 2 drives and I want to use LVM?
[positive]	[05:25]	<lomez>	juan, thank you
[neutral]	[05:25]	<dj-fu>	the white window issue IS caused by insufficient graphics memory in the tfp gl extension on nvidia cards/drivers.
[neutral]	[05:25]	<jlowell>	anyone running 7.04 on an hp laptop?
[negative]	[05:25]	<Juan>	what's a *nix equivalent to razorlame?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<jlowell>	or a laptop with broadcom wireless?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<dj-fu>	It doesn't know what to do when you run out of graphics memory so just textures white
[negative]	[05:25]	<Flannel>	Juan: what does razorlame do?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<bkuebler>	/exit
[neutral]	[05:25]	<Jordan_U>	sinisterguy, System -> Preferences -> Keyboard shortcuts
[neutral]	[05:25]	<Pelo>	Juan,  try this  @HLINK
[negative]	[05:25]	<p47>	rever: yes I have nvidia, but the cube is very slow and I can't see the up bars of the windows I mean the title bars
[negative]	[05:25]	<eck>	Stoffer: have you tried to see if the archive manager can open rars now?
[positive]	[05:26]	<Antioch>	How can I make it so that when I hold down the mouse-wheel and move the mouse up or down the page scrolls up or down?
[positive]	[05:26]	<HasratUSA>	Due to curiosity I just launched Beryl in my feisty. now let me see if it acts weird. for strange reasons i have always been able to fix composite relatead issues
[negative]	[05:26]	<rbrtoclto>	is there any way to get the notification tooltips for network settings, updates, etc. to automatically close after a while?
[positive]	[05:26]	<Hubris2>	jlowell - having troubles getting Broadcom wireless to work?
[negative]	[05:26]	<eck>	(i'm not sure, i've only used cli unrar)
[negative]	[05:26]	<Juan>	Flannel, it's a gui to lame
[negative]	[05:26]	<rever>	you copy instead of copy-to-pixmap
[negative]	[05:26]	<unixforge>	Pelo: so the pass is blank OR blanck?
[neutral]	[05:26]	<eck>	unixforge: what if you switch to VT1?
[neutral]	[05:26]	<jlowell>	Hubris2: indeed
[neutral]	[05:26]	<Jimbo99>	jlowell:  @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:26]	<Stoffer>	eck, i think it's working now that I deleted those two directories... it's taking much longer to extract
[neutral]	[05:26]	<bonee>	where can i get w32codecs
[negative]	[05:26]	<eck>	unixforge: iirc there is a root shell there
[positive]	[05:26]	<Stoffer>	eck, yeah, it worked :) thanks
[negative]	[05:26]	<Pelo>	unixforge,   I mean no password
[positive]	[05:26]	<Jimbo99>	does anyone recall where the icon for the ubuntu menu is located in feisty fawn amd64?
[negative]	[05:26]	<sinisterguy>	Jordan_U: it complains about it being unuseable to typ with that key or something, which is wierd, because it worked fine in edgy
[neutral]	[05:26]	<rever>	p47, nvidia has a bug in there driver
[positive]	[05:26]	<squitijax>	I just downloaded the x86-desktop torrent, and it gives me a GNOME settings daemon error on boot
[neutral]	[05:26]	<ethilien>	bonee: try the universe repository
[neutral]	[05:26]	<jason_>	i dont know what oam doing in the xserver
[positive]	[05:26]	<eck>	Stoffer: weird. well, i'm glad it works :-)
[negative]	[05:26]	<Jordan_U>	Juan, all media apps on Linux use LAME for encoding mp3 AFIK
[negative]	[05:27]	<HasratUSA>	sinisterguy there could have been nicer, easier ways of doing so if and only if your desktop effects AKA compiz had GUI configuration managers such as that of Beryl
[negative]	[05:27]	<unixforge>	Pelo: I tried with no pass. Not working :(
[negative]	[05:27]	<p47>	rever: so what sould I do ?
[neutral]	[05:27]	<artabrahao>	ethilien the tab that is appearing is the on that I clicked in you nick and the one that I start a chat
[negative]	[05:27]	<Juan>	i know, but say i wanna batch downsample some mp3 files
[negative]	[05:27]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: oh well
[neutral]	[05:27]	<wil_syd>	!w32codecs
[positive]	[05:27]	<ubotu>	Seveas has a popular 3rd party repository for several packages, including the win32 codecs: see @HLINK - See also !Codecs
[negative]	[05:27]	<Pelo>	unixforge,  maybe someone else knows,  or you can try checking the forum
[negative]	[05:27]	<ethilien>	artabrahao: did I answer your question?
[positive]	[05:27]	<Za---->	Well Met fellow Linux users
[neutral]	[05:28]	<lomez>	question, i accidentally change the default double-click on .exe to Terminal rather than Wine
[positive]	[05:28]	<unixforge>	Pelo: k, i hope to fing a solution
[negative]	[05:28]	<_Codeman_>	I keep getting grub: error 21 and I can't figure out how to fix it, can anyone assist?
[negative]	[05:28]	<lomez>	and it wont let me change it back for some reason
[positive]	[05:28]	<Pelo>	Za----,  welcome to the madhouse
[negative]	[05:28]	<lomez>	any idea?
[negative]	[05:28]	<rever>	p47, you will have to play with the Beryl Advance options. Force Aiglx and try copy instead of texture from cvopy
[positive]	[05:28]	<klicker>	Will the normal desktop run properly on a 500 Mhz PC with 512MB of memory?
[positive]	[05:28]	<Jordan_U>	lomez, In what way won't it let you? Does it give an error?
[positive]	[05:28]	<Pelo>	unixforge,  it might be different in this version but I've never needed a password to boot the live cd
[neutral]	[05:28]	<ethilien>	klicker: most probably
[positive]	[05:28]	<rever>	p47, YOu may have some performance hit however. What type of card and how much memory
[negative]	[05:28]	<lomez>	No, when I double click it just reverts back to trying to open it with terminal
[negative]	[05:28]	<LordLimecat>	"hey, if i want nvidia drivers, is it ""better"" to just install them with the restricted driver manager, or using nvidias script (version 9755)"
[positive]	[05:29]	<LordLimecat>	which is newer?
[negative]	[05:29]	<jason_>	i cant get me screen back to right size
[neutral]	[05:29]	<Jordan_U>	LordLimecat, Restricted manager, no doubt
[neutral]	[05:29]	<HasratUSA>	p47 you got a nvidia card?
[neutral]	[05:29]	<Jimbo99>	the restricted versions aren't as up to date as the nvidia versions.
[negative]	[05:29]	<p47>	 mg and 1g od memory ram !
[neutral]	[05:29]	<delire>	LordLimecat: try the click and go restricted driver manager first.
[neutral]	[05:29]	<p47>	ha no no no

[positive]	[05:35]	<DShepherd>	squitijax, press f6 remove splash and quiet. Then and single.. got that?
[positive]	[05:36]	<Cisyouc>	Either bcm43xx or ndiswrapper have been very easy and smooth setups.
[positive]	[05:36]	<eck>	TokenBad: (of course you also need to specify a device)
[negative]	[05:36]	<Dr_willis>	I think the live cd may have some 'cheatcodes' you can give it at the boot/grub prompt to make it not start X. but not sure what you COULD do with it from just the console.
[positive]	[05:36]	<squitijax>	DShepherd: thanks
[negative]	[05:36]	<Pelo>	Za----,  no,  but back it up anyway in case something goes wrong,  and wait a few days for the upgrade the servers are overwhelemed

[negative]	[05:49]	<randomwalker>	am i missing something
[negative]	[05:49]	<TokenBad>	what is up with this crap...it will not install to the drive...even with the thing saying its ext3
[positive]	[05:49]	<Jordan_U>	binMonkey, Yup, and so did dapper and Edgy :)
[negative]	[05:50]	<[_miT_] >	Jordan_U: how do i get it to work?
[neutral]	[05:50]	<Jordan_U>	binMonkey, On Feisty they are much improved though, and easier to use

[negative]	[05:50]	<Angel-SL>	hey, how come ubuntu-server doesn't come with make and gcc?
[positive]	[05:50]	<rellik>	since the upgrade, my sound has been acting weird..  I have a playlist in amarok, and when it goes to the next song, it will play it (those dancing bars that show levels work), but there may or may not be any sound.  if a song starts, and is silent, the next song may or may not play.  or, if I restart the current song, it may or may not play..  any ideas what's going on here?
[negative]	[05:50]	<Jimbo99>	Pelo:  the thing is that prior to installing the nvidia drivers the built in screen IS detected.

[positive]	[05:53]	<jeffwheeler>	What is the best way to disable the _expand() function in /etc/bash_completion, which expands ~/ to /home/username in bash?
[neutral]	[05:53]	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   then you proceed and add the new partitons
[negative]	[05:53]	<redsmurf>	hobbsee: here are the extra repos I have installed software from @HLINK have any guess what my mileage w/ upgrading may be?
[neutral]	[05:54]	<eck>	jeffwheeler: iirc it is actually a readline setting
[positive]	[05:54]	<Jimbo99>	Pelo, it isn't my main box.  I am just using it to become more familiar with ubuntu on laptops with wireless (which works now)...  I have a nice desktop set up with feisty amd64

[neutral]	[05:56]	<Jordan_U>	wehttamb, I believe so
[negative]	[05:56]	<Leftmost>	When compiling a custom kernel, how do I create the initrd?
[negative]	[05:56]	<DShepherd>	boyko, maybe slackware is what you want to get your hands into then..
[negative]	[05:56]	<kurtti>	wehttamb, you can. but not the other way i think.
[negative]	[05:56]	<Polygon89>	"pelo, that did not work. I tried running it from the terminal and seeing what it says, and every time i try to make gparted create a disklable, it says in the terminal ""Unable to open /dev/sda - unrecognised disk label."""

[neutral]	[05:57]	<eck>	Leftmost: but the command is update-initramfs

[negative]	[05:57]	<cotton>	I get this when trying to upgrade: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:57]	<Pelo>	Polygon89,  got a cd with the harware,  see if you have a recovery prog on it
[neutral]	[05:57]	<Linux_>	whats the command to reinstall via apt-get in ubuntu?
[negative]	[05:58]	<kurtti>	no, you can open and save. but you can not open the openoffice documents in ms office
[positive]	[05:58]	<Jordan_U>	Polygon89, You may be able to recover them rather than just re-create them
[neutral]	[05:58]	<Dr_willis>	cotton,  may want to summarize the error a bit.
[neutral]	[05:58]	<cables>	Linux_, aptitude reinstall?
[negative]	[05:58]	<wehttamb>	ok thats all i need
[negative]	[05:58]	<eck>	cotton: it means the apt mirror that you are using, which is not an official ubuntu mirror, is borked
[neutral]	[05:58]	<Jordan_U>	Linux_, sudo apt-get install <packagename>
[negative]	[05:58]	<Linux_>	cables I want to do it via apt-get reinstall
[negative]	[05:58]	<cotton>	eck: How can I fix it
[negative]	[05:58]	<Polygon89>	Jordan_U, it is a 500 gb backup drive. i dont have another drive with nearly as much space as that one, and why should i recover backups if all of the drives that the backups came from are still fine?
[negative]	[05:58]	<cables>	Linux_, apt-get and aptitude are pretty much the same
[neutral]	[05:58]	<edrews>	what is the difference between apt-get and aptitude?
[negative]	[05:58]	<eck>	cotton: there's nothing you can do short of notifying the admin of the mirror
[negative]	[05:59]	<Polygon89>	Pelo, are you saying that i should see if i have a recovery cd that came with my usb hdd?
[neutral]	[05:59]	<cables>	edrews, Aptitude handles dependencies a bit better
[neutral]	[05:59]	<kurtti>	aptitude works better
[negative]	[05:59]	<kalifonria909>	why does raid such a pain
[positive]	[05:59]	<[_miT_] >	Jordan_U: still doesnt work after reboot
[negative]	[05:59]	<edrews>	so why do people still use apt-get??
[negative]	[05:59]	<mefistofeles1>	can somebody help me to look for a RPG compiler on linux?
[negative]	[05:59]	<jared_>	can anyone tell me what the main differences between Feisty and Dapper is?
[positive]	[05:59]	<sartan>	does the ubuntu live cd include a mechanism for wpa & wireless on an intel ipw2200 chipset on the latest version of ubuntu yet?  If I can't find out on IRC, what resources are available to be online to find it it does?
[neutral]	[05:59]	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   more or less,   recovery format  maintenence,  stuff in general
[neutral]	[05:59]	<madman91>	can someone help me setup my mouse ? After my upgrade to feisty my scrolly thing wont work... so after following many many many guides on google/ubuntuforums i got it to work a little.. help?
[neutral]	[05:59]	<megafauna>	where can i get a torrent for feisty pls?
[negative]	[05:59]	<Jordan_U>	Polygon89, If it is fine it is fine, I just wanted to tell you that your partitions are likely recoverable before you wrote over them.
[negative]	[05:59]	<mefistofeles1>	can somebody help me to look for a RPG compiler on linux?
[positive]	[05:59]	<kurtti>	edrews, spread the word ;)
[positive]	[05:59]	<cables>	jared_, Feisty automatically installs drivers and codecs, as well as having newer versions of software.
[positive]	[05:59]	<edrews>	Dapper is a year older than Feisty...

[positive]	[06:00]	<jared_>	Thanks :) I just ordered me some feisty CDs to try it out
[negative]	[06:00]	<eck>	megafauna: it is supposed to be torrent.ubuntu.com, but i think it is down right now
[negative]	[06:00]	<cables>	jared_, Feisty also has cool graphical effects that Dapper doesn't have. The installer can also import settings from existing Windows installs, but if you're already using Dapper, i guess you won't need that.
[negative]	[06:00]	<Polygon89>	"Jordan_U, yeah i know they were recoverable (using a program called PhotoRec (i think)), problem is it took forver (eta was 300 hours) so i just said ""screw it... its just backups anyway. not anything important""."
[negative]	[06:00]	<Pelo>	Polygon89,   basicaly if this were 10 years ago with an internal hdd I would tell you to low format it , but that 's not an option anymore so I don't know what to tell you

[positive]	[06:02]	<Pelo>	mefistofeles1,   the servers are a bit overwhelmed at the moment , everyone and their goldfish is upgrading to fiesty, that might cause some problems
[negative]	[06:02]	<cables>	wehttamb, i don't know, but you shouldn't use gaim for IRC, it's really horrible.

[neutral]	[06:03]	<variant>	KalleDK: any  other and clients will have to speciy the port

[positive]	[06:09]	<sartan>	Linux_: depending on the vnc package installed for ubuntu, the vnc password will be in ~/.vnc/passwd as a hash and will not be the same password as a user password
[negative]	[06:09]	<eck>	cotton: no, the mirror is broken, there is nothing you can do
[negative]	[06:09]	<nibsa1242_>	cables I'll just let the cd check itself I guess

[negative]	[06:09]	<eck>	Illnor: if the windows computer has the file sharing option turned on you can access it in gnome by going to places > network
[negative]	[06:10]	<eck>	Illnor: it would only be ubuntu -> windows though
[negative]	[06:10]	<sartan>	Illnor: ~ I heard there's safe NTFS write in fiesty fawn - are you running that or the one before?
[negative]	[06:10]	<Tommy>	Maybe i should be a little more specific, the tty job control error.
[positive]	[06:10]	<bonee>	what is a good site for linux games

[negative]	[06:11]	<paradon>	cotton: Of course, if you have any particularly wierd stuff installed from them, then potentially something could break on upgrade.
[neutral]	[06:11]	<sartan>	koaL: in your httpd.conf you need to uncomment out or allow the relevant entries
[negative]	[06:11]	<jrjazzman>	bzaks: are you running beryl or compiz?  I think you have to set your keys in them if you use them.
[neutral]	[06:11]	<sartan>	or enable mod_userdir
[negative]	[06:11]	<bzaks>	neither
[negative]	[06:11]	<cotton>	ok, what is the comment key? is it #?

[neutral]	[06:13]	<GluE>	how would i go about learning more about remote controlling my ubuntu box from my windows box
[neutral]	[06:13]	<beef>	acidtabs, you will need to compile from source by sounds of it
[positive]	[06:13]	<bzaks>	GluE: look into SSH or VNC
[negative]	[06:13]	<bzaks>	I like VNC: it's like windows remote desktop
[negative]	[06:13]	<beef>	apt-get install gcc and read the documentation in the folder you have
[negative]	[06:13]	<acidtabs>	im not sure how to do it if i have to do it
[negative]	[06:13]	<cotton>	How do I edit /etc/apt/sources.list with the save permission? gedit /etc/apt/sources.list?
[negative]	[06:13]	<neilthereildeil>	beef: does it have anything to do with the fact that whenver i wanna connect to a wireless network, i need to startx and use the utility  in the gnome taskbar and enter the network name?
[neutral]	[06:13]	<ep2011>	I need some help with wireless. It is a Rt61 chipset, which is supported, but I can only get it to work using the command line, not any program... Ive tried wifi-radar, wicd and network-manager. Any help please?

[positive]	[06:14]	<acidtabs>	it has other files in it as well
[positive]	[06:14]	<Tom47>	cotton you have to prepend sudo to the command
[negative]	[06:14]	<beef>	neilthereildeil, i dunno i stick to wired, its just a guess
[negative]	[06:14]	<main>	in root gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

[negative]	[06:17]	<levander>	I just read the Ars Technica story about Feisty being released, and Compbiz being in there by default.  I thought they left Compbiz outta Feisty because of stability issues?

[negative]	[06:18]	<yagami>	Hi- can anyone tell me how to get rid of saved gnome sessions?
[negative]	[06:18]	<Gat0rvean>	When I boot from my Ubuntu CD, and choose the 1st option (live cd / install) It goes through, loads the modules, and when what I can only assume is the login or Desktop environment loading screen comes up, it freezes, playes a musical piece/weird noise, and freezes, like a choppy Window with a Ubuntu logo in the top right, and stays

[negative]	[06:20]	<maccam94>	levander: it is, which is why it's not enabled by default. it is now an option in the GUI now, however, so people who want it can easily get it. it's not unusably unstable, but it isn't stable either
[negative]	[06:20]	<Stoffer>	In scheduling a task to kill Azureus w/ the gnome-scheduler, what would the command be?  Kill azurues wouldn't work, would it?

[positive]	[06:21]	<mojo>	maccam94: it replaces the metacity window manager component between gnome desktop and x.org server
[negative]	[06:21]	<neilthereildeil>	can someone please help me with wireless?
[negative]	[06:21]	<levander>	Stoffer: 'pidof azureus' or 'pgrep azureus' would give the pid
[neutral]	[06:21]	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: what card?
[positive]	[06:21]	<maccam94>	levander: it's a window manager, but it integrates closely with the gnome gconf
[negative]	[06:21]	<yagami>	maccam94: so what about the session- what i am specifically looking for is an ini file that i can delete- or do i have to save the present session as an empty session?
[negative]	[06:21]	<paradon>	cotton: I would get rid of automatix, yes.
[neutral]	[06:21]	<Jordan_U>	Doctor_Nick, It is much easier in Festy and the ops aren't accepting my update to ubotu ( the message is outdated ) just install ntfs-config

[neutral]	[06:21]	<levander>	maccam94: it doesn't sound wierd to you they are calling it effects in the UI?

[neutral]	[06:21]	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: linksys wpc54g
[negative]	[06:22]	<edrews>	Compiz is just a desktop, not a window manager, right?
[positive]	[06:22]	<Stoffer>	levander, yeah, but it changes each time I start it right?  Not useful for a recurring task
[neutral]	[06:22]	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: i have everything working
[neutral]	[06:22]	<paradon>	cotton: Just comment it out, same effect.
[negative]	[06:22]	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: What's the issue?

[negative]	[06:22]	<levander>	Stoffer: so, make this your command to kill it: kill `pgrep azureus`
[negative]	[06:22]	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: do you know the ESSID of the network?
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Doctor_Nick>	Jordon_U: does libntfs9 conflict with libntfs-3cg?
[negative]	[06:22]	<edrews>	mojo, what does Compiz replace in Gnome?
[neutral]	[06:22]	<mojo>	edrews: metacity

[negative]	[06:23]	<Gat0rvean>	[00:18]  <Gat0rvean> When I boot from my Ubuntu CD, and choose the 1st option (live cd / install) It goes through, loads the modules, and when what I can only assume is the login or Desktop environment loading screen comes up, it freezes, playes a musical piece/weird noise, and freezes, like a choppy Window with a Ubuntu logo in the top right, and stays
[neutral]	[06:23]	<darwin>	how can I change the default keyboard layout?
[neutral]	[06:23]	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: yea
[negative]	[06:23]	<yagami>	maccam94: no probs. u've already saved it
[negative]	[06:23]	<r0bby_>	anyways, my problem from last night: I'm compiling the spca5xx kernel module and it's looking for the kernel's config.h file which doesn't exist
[neutral]	[06:23]	<DShepherd>	wow... Hobbsee your working hard tonight
[neutral]	[06:23]	<yagami>	*i've*
[negative]	[06:23]	<maccam94>	levander: they're calling it effects because to most people that's all it'll look like. it uses the same themes as metacity, etc
[negative]	[06:23]	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: Basically, you run
[negative]	[06:23]	<maccam94>	yagami: ah, kk
[negative]	[06:23]	<neilthereildeil>	but the problem is that sometmes the network i need to connect to is the college one and other times it the home one
[neutral]	[06:23]	<Tom47>	deebus have you followed the instructons at @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:23]	<BarronVon>	generally when you install a new cardbus wifi card (trendnet atheros based) on 6.10 do you need to do anything like compile a driver or anything?
[neutral]	[06:23]	<Jordan_U>	Gat0rvean, Do you have an ATi card?
[negative]	[06:23]	<maccam94>	Gat0rvean: what's the problem?
[negative]	[06:23]	<mojo>	edrews: gnome is a desktop environment that uses metacity as it's default window manager.

[neutral]	[06:24]	<ober0ne>	hi... question
[negative]	[06:24]	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: For instance, if my wireless card was on 'eth1' and I wanted to connect to the network called 'foobar', I would run: sudo iwconfig eth1 essid foobar ; dhclient eth1
[neutral]	[06:24]	<maccam94>	ober0ne: ask away
[negative]	[06:24]	<Gat0rvean>	I can't even boot up to the CD, it freezes when it tries to load the desktop
[neutral]	[06:24]	<neilthereildeil>	yea
[negative]	[06:24]	<mojo>	edrews: gnome is more of an ecosystem of parts that make up the 'environment' gnome apps can expect, including things like gconf, gnome-vfs, gtk, such and so

[negative]	[06:25]	<Cisyouc>	neilthereildeil: Is it encrypted?
[negative]	[06:25]	<levander>	Stoffer: I'm not sure of the differences between running your killall and the command I suggested, generally they both do the same thing.  Just play on the command line and check a few man pages...
[neutral]	[06:25]	<neilthereildeil>	Cisyouc: but i also have to startx and tell the program in the taskbar the name of the wireless network
[negative]	[06:25]	<cotton>	Does ubuntu get viruses, if so does it come with a scanner? Also, can I see whats'
[neutral]	[06:25]	<neilthereildeil>	yea

[neutral]	[06:25]	<ober0ne>	I've been trying to find out how to upgrade my 6.06 release of kubuntu (nobody in that channel makes sense!) to 6.10
[neutral]	[06:25]	<maccam94>	cotton: no it doesn't get viruses

[negative]	[06:26]	<maccam94>	cotton: eh, i'll just make a channel
[negative]	[06:26]	<Jordan_U>	cotton, No, it does not, you can get scanners for windows viruses though so you don't spread them to friends
[negative]	[06:26]	<levander>	Stoffer: you're sure it's running?
[negative]	[06:26]	<r0bby_>	'm not talking about those ideas, i'm talking about trying to get webcams to work

[negative]	[06:32]	<Flannel>	kbidd: well, lilypad is the main thing.  There are an assortment of editors.  Technically it, like latex, is just a markup language.

[neutral]	[06:47]	<mojo>	neilthereildeil: you only need it for programs that use that framework, like totem-gstreamer.  other programs like mplayer or vlc don't use gstreamer.  it depends on which apps you choose.  also, totem has a xine-back-end version
[positive]	[06:47]	<kalifonria909>	it doesnt love me

[negative]	[06:48]	<Bsims>	This doesn't make sense to me, Gnome is normal kde. and windowmaker are tiny
[negative]	[06:48]	<rulus>	whta: can you paste your xorg.conf?
[neutral]	[06:48]	<mojo>	neilthereildeil: because reinventing the wheel sux
[negative]	[06:48]	<lazaruslupine>	umm to stop mounting maybe edit them out of your /etc/fstab
[positive]	[06:48]	<neilthereildeil>	ohh ok :)

[neutral]	[06:48]	<catxk>	how large is the download of feisty if I download throuh the update manager?
[neutral]	[06:48]	<whta>	jordan: when i upgraded, it gave me a new message about restricted drivers for an ATI card which i promptly enabled. the issue was there before and after enabling these drivers.
[neutral]	[06:49]	<caneri>	kalifonria909..there is a prog to remove U3
[neutral]	[06:49]	<Bsims>	catxk: depends on how many packages ya have
[neutral]	[06:49]	<Flannel>	catxk: that depends on how many packages you have installed.
[negative]	[06:49]	<rellik>	there's something wrong with my sound since the update..  in my amarok playlist, every other song is silent.  The equalizer bars dance around, as if it were playing, but thereis no sound..  makes it seem like ubuntu isn't correctly handling sound-card sharing, so when the old song is playing, the new one can't fade in
[negative]	[06:49]	<Gat0rvean>	Ok, I can boot into the LiveCD fine in safe mode, but not normal, so does that mean when I do an install, I won't be able to use my Graphics Card? Or how will I go about getting drivers that DO work?
[neutral]	[06:49]	<whta>	rulus: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:49]	<main>	Purp you don't want any hidden errors on ntfs partion before you start

[negative]	[06:49]	<PurpZeY>	Actually, a thought occured to me, I have to HDs...If I could clear one off, could I then install Ubuntu to that drive and still have a dual boot setup, then not having to worry about not messing up my other partition?
[neutral]	[06:49]	<PurpZeY>	two*
[neutral]	[06:49]	<Jimbo99>	can anyone define what the noapic option does?

[negative]	[06:49]	<Flannel>	Gat0rvean: no.  It just means that the diminutive configuration on the liveCD can't
[positive]	[06:49]	<catxk>	Bsims, Flannel: not many so many, pretty basic install... an estimate? :)
[neutral]	[06:49]	<koaL>	do you need to create your own .htaccess file ??
[neutral]	[06:49]	<Jordan_U>	neilthereildeil, apt-cache search <keywords>

[negative]	[06:50]	<main>	yes that would be best Purp
[neutral]	[06:50]	<Bsims>	maybe 700 megs
[neutral]	[06:50]	<Tom47>	PurpZeY: your idea works for me
[negative]	[06:50]	<rulus>	whta: that does look good to me.
[negative]	[06:50]	<maccam94>	Gat0rvean: no, it'll probably use the same driver it's using now. worst case scenario, you get dumped to the command line and you have to install the nvidia binary driver
[negative]	[06:50]	<Flannel>	catxk: less than 700, but somewhere around there
[neutral]	[06:50]	<IntruderZ>	jimbo99 noapic turns off a method of interrupt vector discovery

[neutral]	[06:50]	<ep2011>	okay ill test it, thanks brb again
[positive]	[06:50]	<Gat0rvean>	Flannel, so when I do install, it will be able to find a driver that's copecetic to run the Gnome desktop?
[neutral]	[06:50]	<kalifornia909>	wrong irc command
[negative]	[06:50]	<PurpZeY>	So, when I go to do the install, Ubuntu will ask me where I want it do install, and also will re-format or partition?
[neutral]	[06:50]	<ep2011>	well ill see in the morning
[negative]	[06:50]	<rulus>	whta: I'm sorry, I really don't know then
[negative]	[06:50]	<whta>	brb, i'm gonna restart again and see if it magically fixes.
[negative]	[06:50]	<atomiku>	So guys, at the moment my stuff is in a mess, I want grub on one partition, ubuntu on another, then have the computer boot the grub partition. How can I do this?
[negative]	[06:50]	<catxk>	Flannel: oh... that's more than I expected, thanks
[negative]	[06:50]	<kalifornia909>	i guess server -n doesnt work with xchat
[neutral]	[06:50]	<Jordan_U>	stellaras, Depends how you set it up.
[negative]	[06:50]	<KalleDK>	whats the file called where the mounts are keept (the mount-on-boot server)
[negative]	[06:51]	<stellaras>	can you explain please?

[negative]	[06:51]	<Flannel>	catxk: Well, the alternate CD has 700mb of stuff.  And it contains a bunch of extra stuff.  So, it'll be less than 700.  But I dont have specifics
[neutral]	[06:51]	<KalleDK>	Thx IntruderZ and Dr_willis
[negative]	[06:51]	<neilthereildeil>	why can i not see mplayer under apt-cache search mplayer?
[neutral]	[06:51]	<lazaruslupine>	no problem ep2011
[positive]	[06:51]	<Jimbo99>	intruderz:  thanks.  the first time I launched feisty fawn it crashed and indicated I should try the noapic option.  I tried it and it worked.  so I used it every time I booted.  but today i tried it again without the noapic and even though there's an odd message at boot, it still goes into ubuntu.
[neutral]	[06:51]	<Flannel>	neilthereildeil: because you need to enable multiverse

We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[negative]	[06:53]	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: remove the # from multiverse lines in /etc/apt/sources.list
[negative]	[06:53]	<IntruderZ>	Jimbo99, noapic helps with certain types of hardware, when probing for hardware sometimes apic can hang or reboot the system, hence the need for noapic. I have found that sometimes when a kernel is updated I need to turn it on for some of my systems.

[negative]	[06:56]	<Jimbo99>	IntruderZ:  I'll keep an eye out for it.  i guess I need to put it in some config file to make it permanent.

[neutral]	[06:57]	<|ringo|>	artabrahao: run apt-get update first
[negative]	[06:57]	<Unspeaking>	Jordan_U: You're right, I completely forgot that when you press ENTER it boots you up, however for me it restarts my PC after it attempts to load Linux. I was wondering if there was a boot code that strictly runs the installer
[negative]	[06:57]	<ktulu->	wastrel, the colors look fine, they're just not showing up
[negative]	[06:57]	<bthornton>	well I don't care if it's on the hard drive--but this is a hardwired machine, so it doesn't need to be running ever
[negative]	[06:58]	<|ringo|>	Unspeaking: i dont know the answer to your question, and if no one else does, just download the alternate cd, which boots in console mode

[negative]	[07:04]	<artabrahao>	|ringo|te will read your sources.list file and download the packages that the repos have.  otherwise it doesnt know what repo has ubuntu-desktop
[neutral]	[07:04]	<Jordan_U>	hector, bcm43xx is a driver, and yes ( but you need the firmware for your card for it to work )
[neutral]	[07:04]	<makuseru>	Tom47: what is gub-install?
[neutral]	[07:04]	<neilthereildeil>	wastrel: i just enabled everything in that file(except the descriuptions of what things do)

[neutral]	[07:05]	<tom_>	omegabeta: can you get to a prompt?
[negative]	[07:05]	<hector>	Jordan_U, I know that, but how does that program work?
[negative]	[07:05]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  it's probably on a security or src line then, it's not the normal package repo
[neutral]	[07:05]	<|ringo|>	artabrahao: in a terminal window type ping <ipaddress>
[neutral]	[07:05]	<lazaruslupine>	ping <address>

[positive]	[07:06]	<neilthereildeil>	it still doesnt work
[neutral]	[07:06]	<Jordan_U>	hector, To get your card to work run: sudo apt-get install bcm43xx-fwcutter
[negative]	[07:06]	<Tom47>	makuseru: the first error you have is somehing to do with grub-install notrunning and its my guess that because it did not run it would not allow the rest of the kernel configurations to be cahnged either
[negative]	[07:06]	<neilthereildeil>	wastrel: i enabled all the security lines to
[positive]	[07:06]	<sam__>	anyone know my problem, can anyone give suggestions what to use isntead of webmin?
[positive]	[07:06]	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK:  I haven't tried to mount my extra ext3 drives yet under 7.04 amd64 yet.  I don't know about the changes to this new release.

[neutral]	[07:07]	<Jimbo99>	KalleDK: changes to that.
[neutral]	[07:07]	<tom_>	omegabeta: that should get the upgrade process going again
[neutral]	[07:07]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  you need to have multiverse on the correct line.
[negative]	[07:07]	<makuseru>	Tom47: no, its nothing to do with grub
[neutral]	[07:07]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  use easysource

[neutral]	[07:07]	<wastrel>	!easysource | neilthereildeil
[neutral]	[07:07]	<ubotu>	neilthereildeil: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - @HLINK
[negative]	[07:07]	<K>	"neilthereildeil: have you just tried ""sudo apt-get install mplayer ?"
[negative]	[07:07]	<rellik>	there's something wrong with my sound since the update..  in my amarok playlist, every other song is silent.  The equalizer bars dance around, as if it were playing, but thereis no sound..  makes it seem like ubuntu isn't correctly handling sound-card sharing, so when the old song is playing, the new one can't fade in
[negative]	[07:07]	<K>	maybe for some reason... something funny is happening??? But that would be very odd
[negative]	[07:07]	<sam__>	arrg any other programs ubnutu approves instead of webmin>>>
[neutral]	[07:08]	<|ringo|>	sam__: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:08]	<Tom47>	makuseru: ok ... what does line 13 tell you??
[positive]	[07:08]	<Jimbo99>	NEIL wants to simply play .mp3 files.  I recommended amarok but he wants to use mplayer
[negative]	[07:08]	<Jordan_U>	rellik, Are you using ALSA?
[positive]	[07:08]	<K>	Amarok all the way :p
[positive]	[07:08]	<tom_>	go muine :)
[negative]	[07:08]	<KalleDK>	Ok Jimbo99 Well just have to try then :OP
[neutral]	[07:08]	<makuseru>	Tom47: its not in my grub
[neutral]	[07:09]	<dcubuntu>	bucko: Yes I am sure it is installed correctly.
[negative]	[07:09]	<whta>	i'm getting absolutely no sound at all. i checked in my sound options in the preferences dialog and selected my sound card for output, but i'm getting nothing. volume is up, everything plugged in/on.
[negative]	[07:09]	<bucko>	If it only loads with the CD in, then its just the livecd booting
[negative]	[07:09]	<|ringo|>	whta: are you sure that PCM is cranked up?
[negative]	[07:09]	<crimsun>	whta: what's the output from ``tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat''?
[negative]	[07:09]	<Jimbo99>	whta:  the mixer is launched so you can see the controls?
[positive]	[07:09]	<whta>	ringo: yes
[neutral]	[07:09]	<dcubuntu>	bucko:  Ubuntu is installed, grub in installed as well, its not a live cd its the alternate install cd.

[negative]	[07:10]	<neilthereildeil>	which sources should i include on that website?
[neutral]	[07:10]	<whta>	jimbo: yes. i believe so..
[negative]	[07:10]	<Telarian02>	so edgy and feisty's /usr/share/font directories are not entirely the same and I jacked mine up anyone know where I could get a clean fonts dir?
[negative]	[07:10]	<Cryoniq>	Uhm.. Anyone else upgraded from edgy to feisty noticed your system going into hibernate during the night?
[positive]	[07:10]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  community supported
[negative]	[07:10]	<crimsun>	whta: please read @HLINK and tell me the URL of the paste generated by the script linked from that page.
[neutral]	[07:10]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  also the standard one

[positive]	[07:11]	<artabrahao>	ringo in console how can I chance ip, netmask, gatway and dns?
[neutral]	[07:11]	<d0lph1nK1ng>	does feisty come with ndiswrapper?
[positive]	[07:11]	<Jordan_U>	d0lph1nK1ng, It can be installed ( although if you have a broadcom card I would recommend using the native drivers )
[neutral]	[07:11]	<Jimbo99>	whta:  double click on the sound icon in your panel and it will launch the mixer so you know for sure.
[positive]	[07:11]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  you need both
[neutral]	[07:11]	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: mplayer is avail by default
[negative]	[07:11]	<Cryoniq>	"I just woke up and computer was off.. I$B$""(B1000% sure it was up and running when I left it.. 0o"
[neutral]	[07:11]	<neilthereildeil>	|ringo|: it def is not
[neutral]	[07:11]	<whta>	jimbo: pcm is up. i'm not getting the normal drum beat when the login screen shows up
[negative]	[07:11]	<d0lph1nK1ng>	Jordan_U, ndis did the trick n edgy, just couldn't find ndis on the cd like i could for edgy
[negative]	[07:11]	<wastrel>	|ringo|:  it's in multiverse so no it's not
[neutral]	[07:11]	<GluE>	im having troubles connecting to my vnc server on my ubuntu box from this windows box, how would i go about troubleshooting it
[negative]	[07:12]	<Cole_>	i have a question, i have just installed 7.04 and when i restart, i get a grub error (21) and cannot boot into windoze or ubuntu. i think i need to mount the drive i just installed ubuntu on and reinstall grub, but i need a little help doing that (if that is what i need to do)
[neutral]	[07:12]	<whta>	crimsun: i need to download alsa-info?
[neutral]	[07:12]	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: well if you have a backup of your orig. sources.list, it surely is
[neutral]	[07:12]	<orbin>	Jordan_U: so they've improved support in feisty?
[neutral]	[07:12]	<crimsun>	whta: yes.
[positive]	[07:12]	<KalleDK>	Jimbo think i got it :) UUID=theid   /mount/point ext3 defaults 0 0
[neutral]	[07:12]	<Jordan_U>	orbin, Yes
[negative]	[07:12]	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: what error messags are you getting with apt-get?
[positive]	[07:12]	<Jimbo99>	cole:  you have sata and switch the drive around after you installed ubuntu?
[negative]	[07:12]	<smt6k>	Hi, I just upgraded to feisty and now my suspend doesn't work.  Is that common?
[negative]	[07:12]	<neilthereildeil>	do i need backpots?
[negative]	[07:12]	<|ringo|>	neilthereildeil: it could just be that the servers are slow becaues everyone is using them at the moment
[negative]	[07:13]	<Dial_tone>	can you use a fat32 formatted ipod on a mac at all?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<wastrel>	neilthereildeil:  no
[neutral]	[07:13]	<Jordan_U>	d0lph1nK1ng, I would still recommend at least trying fwcutter before NDIS ( Native Drivers are always better )
[neutral]	[07:13]	<DigitallyStoned>	hello
[neutral]	[07:13]	<DigitallyStoned>	what repo is wine in now?
[negative]	[07:13]	<Jimbo99>	the servers were refusing to allow me to download packages earlier so that's why i'm here chatting with you all...so expect to have problems downloading.
[neutral]	[07:13]	<Jordan_U>	Dial_tone, Yes
[negative]	[07:13]	<Cole_>	Jimbo99: no, i have a weird setup right now. i use a sata drive primarily for windoze and then have an ide drive with ubuntu on it
[neutral]	[07:13]	<fak3r>	ok, best kernel to use for desktop?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<Flannel>	DigitallyStoned: universe
[positive]	[07:13]	<Jordan_U>	fak3r, Generic :)
[negative]	[07:14]	<K>	neilthereildeil: are you getting errors when updating your lists?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<whta>	crimsun: @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:14]	<DigitallyStoned>	Flannel: so sudo apt-get install wine
[neutral]	[07:14]	<DigitallyStoned>	should work right?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<Jimbo99>	cole:  but did you switch them on the headers on the motherboard after you installed?  or did you not have your windoze drive connected when you installed ubuntu?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<Flannel>	DigitallyStoned: if you've enabled universe and updated your package list, yes
[negative]	[07:14]	<Tom47>	makuseru: there doesn't need for anything to be wrong with r grub but it does seem that for a some reason grub-install is not running and for that reason the install script does not finish corectly
[negative]	[07:14]	<fak3r>	Jordan_U: so what does -386 or -lowlatency get you?
[negative]	[07:14]	<Cryoniq>	hmm.. my menus etc just disapeared in gnome (7.04) lol.. hmm..
[neutral]	[07:14]	<DigitallyStoned>	Flannel: et me see if he did
[negative]	[07:15]	<Ringo>	I tried to upgrade to v7.04 using the package manager and it tells me I dont have enought room in my /boot partition .. any way to expand it ?
[neutral]	[07:15]	<wastrel>	Cryoniq:  killall gnome-panel
[negative]	[07:15]	<Cole_>	Jimbo99: i didnt switch anything, simply plugged that ide drive in, loaded ubuntu and installed it on it (cleaning out my ubuntu 6.04 that was on that drive)
[negative]	[07:15]	<Jordan_U>	fak3r, -386 is what you get with Generic and lowlatency helps with serious audio editing.
[neutral]	[07:15]	<sam__>	-shoot
[positive]	[07:15]	<fak3r>	Ringo: remove some old kernels...
[positive]	[07:15]	<Cryoniq>	wastrel, thank :)

[neutral]	[07:15]	<Ringo>	did that
[positive]	[07:15]	<Jimbo99>	cole:  but was the windoze driver attached when you installed ubuntu on the other drive?
[negative]	[07:15]	<Ringo>	only one kernel left
[positive]	[07:15]	<|ringo|>	Ringo: before trying to resize you could delete older version numbered kernels
[negative]	[07:15]	<meng>	for some reason i cannot make beryl-manager start with my XGL session
[positive]	[07:15]	<Jimbo99>	cole:  err windows DRIVE*

[negative]	[07:16]	<sam__>	command is not working and for somereason its just not downloading basically at all
[negative]	[07:16]	<Jordan_U>	meng, You might have to ad a 10 second delay to let XGL load completely before beryl starts
[negative]	[07:16]	<Meshezabeel>	upgrade to feisty deleted beryl-manager off my computer, is this normal???
[positive]	[07:16]	<Cryoniq>	wastrel, hmm how do I do that? :P It seems I cannot open a terminal.. hmm
[neutral]	[07:16]	<crimsun>	whta: asoundconf set-default-card Audigy2

[neutral]	[07:37]	<eylisian>	imbecile, sata?
[positive]	[07:37]	<crimsun>	hector: keep doing so. Be persistent.
[negative]	[07:37]	<ceil420>	Jordan_U, oh, ok
[negative]	[07:37]	<Heskethj>	eylisian, yes I have been very confused about it. I haven't bothered with ndiswrapper or anything since the drivers *seem* to be detecting the card. Perhaps it would be worth a try or will that cause extra issues down the road with compatibility. I have read the ubuntu documents and I have not found anything of use.
[neutral]	[07:38]	<Tom47>	imbecile have you checked/validated the cd?
[negative]	[07:38]	<nateman1352>	"hi, I just installed feisty and tried using the ""desktop effects"" (aka compiz) and it was great for a while, but then the cube stopped working has this happened to anyone else, and did you manage to fix it?"
[negative]	[07:38]	<imbecile>	eylisian:  why is there issues with sata?
[positive]	[07:38]	<hector>	crimsun, both Master and PCM need to have the same value?
[neutral]	[07:38]	<imbecile>	tom yes
[neutral]	[07:38]	<ceil420>	i updated before the 19th, so -c -d worked :X
[negative]	[07:38]	<Jordan_U>	ceil420, One of those ( can't remember if it's -c or -d ) tells update-manager to also look for developement versions
[negative]	[07:38]	<crimsun>	whta: err, you created your own asoundrc? No wonder.
[negative]	[07:38]	<mattman>	orbin, i can't. i have ti restart, and i lose the copy and paste feature, but i can tell you what it said...
[negative]	[07:38]	<eylisian>	Heskethj, seems like encryption might be the issue.

[neutral]	[07:39]	<makuseru>	Tom47: that fixed it for me
[negative]	[07:39]	<mattman>	orbin, it said that apt-get was not currently installed and that i should use the command apt-get install apt to get it back.  it then tells me that a shell script is starting, and to press crtl-d to continue booting
[positive]	[07:39]	<Tom47>	makuseru: very good
[negative]	[07:39]	<eylisian>	Heskethj, ok. How about pasting the output of iwconfig in the pastebin.

[negative]	[07:40]	<nicole>	anybody know anything about that?
[neutral]	[07:40]	<paradon>	nicole: I found the open source driver very, very slow after upgrading to Feisty.  Didn't think to check the logs, just upgraded to the binary which is fine.
[negative]	[07:40]	<whta>	ok, crimsun. i have no idea what we just did or why we did it, but it worked, and i thank you so much for working with me like that.
[negative]	[07:40]	<nateman1352>	sdfasdfawef, it appears I don't... wonder how that happened, anyway do you remember where that preference is (use KDE most of the time)
[neutral]	[07:40]	<artabrahao>	in console how can I chance ip, netmask, gatway and dns?

[negative]	[07:41]	<Heskethj>	eylisian: I don't know why it is listing ra1's ESSID since the wireless *isn't* connected. I am on my laptop now with a wired connection through network manager

[positive]	[07:42]	<mattman>	orbin, i agree, but the system is fine, after boot.  I did a fresh install from cd.  i just used apt-get to get this irc client... weird
[positive]	[07:42]	<volvoguy>	hey all. i'd like to upgrade my breezy server to feisty (or at least edgy) and the documention is obviously for desktop - as it highly recommeds using update-manager and highly discourages using apt-get. is there a safe way to use apt-get?
[neutral]	[07:42]	<crimsun>	hector: cat /proc/asound/cards    (to pastebin)
[neutral]	[07:42]	<Jordan_U>	sickofwireless, Top right corner, network-manager
[neutral]	[07:42]	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, sudo iwlist eth1 scan
[negative]	[07:42]	<Cryoniq>	hmm logs tell that system tried to go into suspend because system was idle.. but then it failed.. odd..
[negative]	[07:42]	<paradon>	nicole: hrm... iirc the fglrx driver has a bunch of AGP related options...  I played with them some way back under Dapper when it wasn't working... haven't touched them since tho.

[negative]	[07:49]	<DShepherd>	legos, gnome-baker works for me

[neutral]	[07:49]	<DShepherd>	legos, gnomebaker*
[positive]	[07:49]	<bucko>	acidtabs, gnome-look.org has a beryl section with lots of themes
[negative]	[07:49]	<rickfdez>	hey folks - I d/l'ed the iso for PPC and can't figure out how to get it to boot into live desktop - it always wants to install instead of run desktop
[neutral]	[07:49]	<Jordan_U>	legos, Gnome's built in tool is fine, Place -> CD/DVD creator
[neutral]	[07:49]	<EnsignRedshirt>	So, where can I find the correct md5sum for the feisty desktop iso image?  It is strange that it is not provided somewhere in the download page at www.ubunutulinux.org (or am I blind?)
[neutral]	[07:49]	<acidtabs>	ty
[neutral]	[07:49]	<rickfdez>	appreciate any help on how to do this
[negative]	[07:50]	<kbidd>	I know this is more appropriate in #medibuntu, but there was no response there -- what codec do i need to get radio working in banshee?
[negative]	[07:50]	<Heskethj>	eylisian: hmm, lcpci was rather interesting: @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:50]	<rickfdez>	i'm on a mac and have no problem booting from cd - just can't get live desktop as an option
[negative]	[07:50]	<acidtabs>	oh also emerald-themes,beryl-plugins
[positive]	[07:50]	<Jordan_U>	"rickfdez, When it says ""install or run Ubuntu"" the OR is important :)"
[neutral]	[07:50]	<TehUni>	rickfdez: sure you didnt get the alternate cd on accident?
[negative]	[07:51]	<overshard>	So, quick question, how does one disable the splash screen in 7.04... it isn't under sessions anymore that I could see
[negative]	[07:51]	<rickfdez>	i don't get an option asking for install or run - after I press Enter, it just starts the install process
[neutral]	[07:51]	<DShepherd>	EnsignRedshirt, @HLINK
[negative]	[07:51]	<Jordan_U>	rickfdez, Unless you downloaded the alternate CD then the default should boot into a working Demo of Ubuntu
[positive]	[07:51]	<bucko>	Emerald themes are available on gnome-look.org, beryl-plugins are available thru Feisty repos
[neutral]	[07:51]	<rickfdez>	(i exit when i get to partition options)
[negative]	[07:51]	<rickfdez>	maybe i did get the wrong cd, i'll have to check - what should i look for?
[neutral]	[07:51]	<kbidd>	overshard, install gnome-splashscreen-manager
[negative]	[07:51]	<omegabeta>	Question: If i boot in to the fiesty live cd and chose to make my existing edgy install (sda1) the root (/) and install it that way, will that erase everything or keep everything intact and simply upgrade the dist? I'm having huge issues upgrading and ive pretty much broken everything so i just want to install ubuntu fiesty clean from the cd but keep everything i already have on my existing efty install..
[negative]	[07:51]	<Heskethj>	eylisian: sorry, I didn't do it as root. Try this: @HLINK
[positive]	[07:51]	<overshard>	kbidd, thanks
[negative]	[07:52]	<rickfdez>	you know what? I did get the alternate CD - i just saw that in the name of the ISO i d'led
[positive]	[07:52]	<kbidd>	overshard, np... i spent about an hour today trying to figure that one out myself :P
[positive]	[07:52]	<EnsignRedshirt>	DShepherd: Thanks.
[negative]	[07:52]	<rickfdez>	what cd do I need to get?

[neutral]	[07:52]	<hector>	crimsun, @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:52]	<DShepherd>	EnsignRedshirt, no prob
[negative]	[07:52]	<Jordan_U>	omegabeta, No, unless your /home is on another partition
[positive]	[07:52]	<Flannel>	rickfdez: alt CD is a good choice.  and it'll work.  Unless you need a live environment
[neutral]	[07:52]	<overshard>	kbidd, hehe you don't like the splash screen either? I've redone absolutely everything but that and feel no need in having a splash screen anyways it just flashes my comp loads so fast
[negative]	[07:52]	<omegabeta>	"actually, i think /home ""is"" on another paty.. i just cant bloody remember :("
[positive]	[07:52]	<kbidd>	overshard, after you install it, its under System > Preferances > Splash Screen
[negative]	[07:53]	<Heskethj>	omegabeta, As far as I know the partition will be formatted upon installation, you should back up your /home folders if they aren't on another partition already
[positive]	[07:53]	<overshard>	kbidd, kk thanks
[neutral]	[07:53]	<rickfdez>	flannel: what do u mean - can i boot to live desktop from alternate cd too?
[positive]	[07:53]	<acidtabs>	Thanks again Bucko
[neutral]	[07:53]	<kbidd>	overshard, in the past its nice, but feisty just loads so fast i dont see the point
[neutral]	[07:53]	<Jordan_U>	omegabeta, You can check with the LiveCD

[negative]	[07:53]	<eylisian>	Heskethj, looks fine and well there. How about ... it's ok, as a normal user, root shows the capabilities of the device is all. Anyway how about the contents of /etc/network/interfaces?  output of; cat /etc/network/interfaces in the astebin would be cool. it looks like the machine is recognizing it.
[neutral]	[07:53]	<vm>	can someone help me installing ati drivers?

[negative]	[07:54]	<kbidd>	vm, whats your problem?  I just installed mobility radion 9000 drivers on my laptop.
[negative]	[07:54]	<overshard>	kbidd, actually the only problem i'm having in feisty is dvd play back and usplash customization... everything else is fine got byrel and avant up looks nice

[negative]	[07:54]	<kosnick>	kbidd : what about the net directly? cause i faced some problem with it
[negative]	[07:54]	<mjbrooks>	omegabeta, you can't remember if your /home is on another partition?
[negative]	[07:54]	<omegabeta>	the live cd option is to etiehr resize etc (which i dont want) or the manual, so i go to manual and it displays a all the parts.. So if i turn my existing borknen edy install from sda1 to / it will just install over it but keep everything.. if you get me?
[negative]	[07:54]	<eylisian>	willwill, I would try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[negative]	[07:55]	<vm>	and i sorta stumbled through, then when i rebooted, input not supported flashed over my screen
[negative]	[07:55]	<omegabeta>	actually, considering there is only 1 ext4 part and a ntfs and a few reifers, im assuming /home is on the same partition so yes
[positive]	[07:55]	<eylisian>	willwill, but know your monitor and video card valuses or stick to the low debconf priority.
[negative]	[07:55]	<karthik>	ok Dshepard
[neutral]	[07:55]	<omegabeta>	ext3*
[positive]	[07:55]	<kbidd>	overshard, you can replace usplash with splashy if you want :P
[negative]	[07:56]	<willwill>	eylisian, i don't understand your answer. please use simple english.
[negative]	[07:56]	<eylisian>	Heskethj, ok. the wireles iface is wlan0

[negative]	[07:56]	<overshard>	kbidd, i'll give it a shot installing it now... wait installed* it now
[negative]	[07:56]	<kbidd>	kosnick, im not sure but if you set the repositories to the feisty ones it should work
[negative]	[07:56]	<hector>	crimsun, nop, nothing
[negative]	[07:56]	<Moosejaw>	how do i disable keyring manager from asking me for a password when logging into my wpa network?
[neutral]	[07:56]	<mjbrooks>	omegabeta, if /home is on the same partition as / you need to back it up first
[negative]	[07:56]	<NickGarvey>	willwill: don't over estimate how good your hardware is, pick lower settings if you are unsure
[negative]	[07:56]	<overshard>	Jordan_U_, a usplash replacement i guess
[negative]	[07:56]	<Flannel>	rickfdez: oh.  If that's your question, then no.  Alt CD is just an installer
[positive]	[07:56]	<kosnick>	kbidd : i think it sets the repositories itself , doesn't it?
[positive]	[07:56]	<eylisian>	willwill, you will possible need to know horiz. sync and vert refresh for the monitor. possible the amount of memory your video card has as well in KB.
[neutral]	[07:56]	<Jordan_U_>	overshard, What is the difference?
[positive]	[07:56]	<kbidd>	Moosejaw, run the keyring manager, and set the manager to allways allow the application
[neutral]	[07:56]	<crimsun>	"hector: replace ""laptop-hp"" with ""laptop"""

[neutral]	[07:57]	<kbidd>	kosnick, not sure
[negative]	[07:57]	<rickfdez>	flannel - yeah, tht's the problem, since I don't want to install

[negative]	[07:57]	<FreeNet>	Hi is there any wireless network profiler on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[07:57]	<eylisian>	Heskethj, hmmm.
[positive]	[07:57]	<hector>	crimsun, it tells me to reload the volume control
[neutral]	[07:58]	<rickfdez>	flannel: thanks - now it's just a question of finding a desktop version for OSX
[negative]	[07:58]	<Crazytom>	sickofwireless, then you're going to have to install wpasupplicant if it's not already installed

[positive]	[07:58]	<NickGarvey>	FreeNet: comes by default in feisty I believe
[negative]	[07:58]	<Heskethj>	eylisian, paste what?
[negative]	[07:58]	<overshard>	Jordan_U_, I don't like anything that Ubuntu does in the way of GUI interfaces personally
[neutral]	[07:58]	<crimsun>	hector: do so if you feel inclined.
[negative]	[07:58]	<smt6k>	Anyone have any idea how to track down errors in suspend?  It worked in 6.10 but after upgrading, it's all broken.
[positive]	[07:58]	<overshard>	kbidd, I got one I want the only problem is installing it :D
[neutral]	[07:58]	<eylisian>	Heskethj, we need to find out what driver your card uses... lsmod, you can dump the entire contents.
[neutral]	[07:59]	<Jordan_U_>	smt6k, Do you have an ATi card?
[negative]	[07:59]	<overshard>	kbidd, it is built for usplash but for edgy so i'm trying to tweak it

I uncommented the line in /etc/vim/vimrc 'syntax on' but now vi complains that the syntax command is not available in this version. Any ideas?
[negative]	[08:23]	<kruepke>	malik__: I think changing your default browser in KDE might do that...(not sure)
[positive]	[08:23]	<Ernz>	Cotton: Rain is on that setting manager (beryl-manager) under Extras>Water Effects>Rain :)
[negative]	[08:23]	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, thats the 4 poss locations video players look for codecs
[neutral]	[08:23]	<jasin>	dont use medibuntu, easyubuntu, or anything similar, apt-get anything you need.
[positive]	[08:23]	<Pawba>	Does 7.04 work in MS VPC?
[neutral]	[08:23]	<Doctor_Nick>	noiesmo: still no go

[neutral]	[08:26]	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, i thinks u need some xine codecs as kaffine uses xine engine
[neutral]	[08:26]	<Doctor_Nick>	k
[neutral]	[08:26]	<Ernz>	Cotton: ....wtf? Try reinstalling the entire beryl package, remember to delete the settings folder that relate to it in Home
[negative]	[08:26]	<Flannel>	xange: right.  That's the one.  Starts up without any of the gnome startup stuff.  I suppose it depends on how beryl does it.
[neutral]	[08:27]	<Ernz>	NickGalvary: Can I send you a screenshot somehow of what I have?
[negative]	[08:27]	<xange>	Flannel: I acctually ended up removing beryl and beryl-manager so I don't know what is going on now...
[neutral]	[08:27]	<kruepke>	malik__: use the System Settings app
[neutral]	[08:27]	<cotton>	Ernz: What settings folder? I just upgraded to 7.10
[negative]	[08:27]	<foxiness>	"hi, i want to know if there something similar to apt-get autoremove on aptitude coz am aptitude user ""and more clean to use aptitude imo"""
[neutral]	[08:27]	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, sudo apt-get install libxine-extracodecs libmad0 try these two
[positive]	[08:27]	<cotton>	And, is there a simple command I can use to repair beryl
[negative]	[08:27]	<kruepke>	malik__: are you using KDE as your desktop?
[negative]	[08:27]	<jasin>	Only thing vlc for linux wont do is real stuff, amr, and captioning.
[negative]	[08:28]	<Ernz>	Cotton: I would delete .beryl and .emerald, and then reinstall the lot
[negative]	[08:28]	<mjbrooks>	cotton, 7.10?!!  you time traveller you!  How is Gutsy Gibbon running for you?
[neutral]	[08:28]	<cotton>	lol

[neutral]	[08:29]	<kruepke>	malik__: ok, then System Setting and click KDE Components

[positive]	[08:29]	<Doctor_Nick>	thanks noiesmo
[positive]	[08:29]	<noiesmo>	Doctor_Nick, np :)
[positive]	[08:29]	<kruepke>	You should be able to change Web Browser in there.
[positive]	[08:29]	<Ernz>	Cotton: just go to synaptic package manager and mark for complete removal of the 'beryl' package and the 'emerald' package. Then delete the folders, then reinstall both of those packages. Restart X and fire up beryl-settings. See what happens
[negative]	[08:29]	<kruepke>	If that does not help, I'm stumped.
[neutral]	[08:29]	<Pawba>	hm

[negative]	[08:31]	<jasin>	noiesmo, yes, that's right.
[neutral]	[08:31]	<squitijax>	Is there a text-based installer in the x86-desktop cd?
[negative]	[08:31]	<cotton>	Ernz: When I mark beryl for remove, it only marks a few other folders, should I delet everything with beryl?

[neutral]	[08:32]	<jasin>	noiesmo, isn't swiftfox  just firefox compiled specifically for the type of cpu you have though?
[negative]	[08:32]	<Jack313>	NickGarvey: those are the ntfsresize errors, let me find the gparted errors, one sec
[negative]	[08:32]	<Ernz>	Cotton: Yes, they are all associated with beryl, to make it work. One of those might be broken or corrupted so yes, just remove whatever it selects too.

[negative]	[09:12]	<beernutz>	just did the upgrade on my big box, and it APPEARS that the 3ware sata raid drivers did not get included in the initramfs of the new kernel because it dont see ANY drives (the /drives directory does not even exist under /dev/) can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this please?

[negative]	[09:14]	<Lukemob>	Any idea?
[neutral]	[09:14]	<Tex_Arcana>	Mjbrooks it was an upgrade. I even followed the instructions on the upgrade page.
[neutral]	[09:14]	<PurpZeY>	I actually see a line in my sources.list that includes feisty-security universe, that mean it is already enabled?
[negative]	[09:14]	<mjbrooks>	Tex_Arcana, yeah,  but they have been know to not work too well for some systems
[neutral]	[09:14]	<Azureday>	I will try it now
[negative]	[09:15]	<Jordan_U>	Azureday, You may have blacklisted the driver when you installed NDIS wrapper though so you may have to undo that for bcm43xx to load automatically at boot
[neutral]	[09:15]	<Helmi>	good morning guys
[negative]	[09:15]	<Azureday>	I know that

It APPEARS that the 3ware sata raid drivers did not get included in the initramfs of the new kernel because it does not see ANY drives (the /drives directory does not even exist under /dev/) can anyone point me in the right direction to fix this please?
[neutral]	[09:18]	<hamp_>	Jordan_u i have to type that in terminal every time to run it or what?
[negative]	[09:18]	<jasin>	I'm having an issue with a synaptic touchpad, its seems installing feisty fawn didn't fix anything as far as my touchpad is concerned.

[positive]	[09:50]	<Libere>	Muiske: I uninstalled and reinstalled and it works.
[negative]	[09:50]	<aarmenaa>	I see.  Your GPG error might be related to the servers being very overloaded, since 7.04 was just released.  If that's the case, then have to wait, unfortunately.  Otherwise, I don't know.
[negative]	[09:51]	<Muiske>	Fujitsu: Yep, it dies... what else does? I... really wouldn't downgrade since I don't know what dependencies that would brake.

[negative]	[09:53]	<Flannel>	Jack313: Do that.  Go back a step, delete that partition, and reformat it.  Then mounting it as / should work

[neutral]	[10:13]	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: I think rc.local is a place for you to put startup scripts, but by default it doesnt do anything but exit
[negative]	[10:13]	<Bouboule>	I check that now ! wait plz...
[negative]	[10:13]	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: no, it is not an installation. Ubuntu is already installed, but i want to kick out my small data disk and put it into an usb frame. thats why
[negative]	[10:13]	<eck>	dorto: is there no way you can get something like a mini pci card?
[positive]	[10:13]	<Skiptest>	stockfisch: NTFS RW is still experimental
[negative]	[10:13]	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: Not any more.
[negative]	[10:13]	<aarmenaa>	Exposition, @HLINK has instructions for a bunch of different ways of upgrading.  One of them is for CD upgrades.
[positive]	[10:13]	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: ntfs-3g is widely regarded as perfectly stable.
[negative]	[10:13]	<dorto>	eck, PCI cards are cumbersome to maintain. I wanted to buy a USB card
[neutral]	[10:13]	<aarmenaa>	I did once computer using that way, worked great.
[neutral]	[10:14]	<Skiptest>	Fujitsu: cool
[negative]	[10:14]	<Skiptest>	Fujitsu: is it in the kernel, or module-only?
[neutral]	[10:14]	<dorto>	"isn't there a name of a popular USB wireless card for ubuntu, like ""get ASUS 167g from amazon and it will give no problems with edgy/fiesty"""
[negative]	[10:14]	<aarmenaa>	Just make sure you download the ALTERNATE cd.  NOT DESKTOP CD.
[negative]	[10:14]	<Bouboule>	"Blubloblu I've just checked that and in fact as you said there's nothing than ""exit 0"", what can I do ???"
[positive]	[10:14]	<mjbrooks>	mmmm ntfs-3g   now if only no one ever needed it  ;)
[negative]	[10:14]	<stockfisch>	Skiptest: I know about that. thats why i want to use fat32(data) and ext3(containing a secure container for private data)
[neutral]	[10:14]	<Jordan_U>	dorto  @HLINK
[neutral]	[10:14]	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: It isn't in the kernel, as it runs in userspace.
[negative]	[10:15]	<eck>	dorto: i'm not sure about usb wireless, but there are a number of good pcmcia wireless cards
[negative]	[10:15]	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: I 'm having the same problem buddy!
[neutral]	[10:15]	<Bouboule>	:~-|
[neutral]	[10:15]	<mjbrooks>	"stockfisch, ext3 is not "" secure""   you need encryption for that"
[neutral]	[10:15]	<PurpZeY>	Where would I find the XF86Config file?
[negative]	[10:15]	<mlissner>	I did the CD download install technique and it didn't work.
[neutral]	[10:15]	<Skiptest>	Fujitsu: I haven't seen NTFS, except as modules
[neutral]	[10:15]	<mlissner>	Just FYI.
[neutral]	[10:15]	<dorto>	eck, pcmcia works only with laptops having pcmcia slots, right?
[neutral]	[10:15]	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[neutral]	[10:15]	<aarmenaa>	@HLINK
[positive]	[10:15]	<jijutm>	guys any one there. I am on Fiesty beta.. and need to change my display resolution to 1024x768 from 1280x1024.. when I change in the preferences, and apply, the screen goes blank and I cant even shutdown the system.. any leads ?
[neutral]	[10:15]	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: It uses FUSE, and isn't a kernel module.
[negative]	[10:15]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	whats program that edits the repositories?
[negative]	[10:15]	<Bouboule>	"maybe trying to comment the ""exit 0"" ??"
[negative]	[10:15]	<PurpZeY>	Fujitsu: Is there some search function, so I wouldn't have to bother everyone?
[neutral]	[10:16]	<eck>	dorto: that is correct
[neutral]	[10:16]	<aarmenaa>	"Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says ""(alternate driver: rt73usb)"" even though rt73usb is blacklisted."
[negative]	[10:16]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	or where is the repository source file located?
[negative]	[10:16]	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: Just keep bothering us, it's no problem.
[positive]	[10:16]	<PurpZeY>	Thanks man
[negative]	[10:16]	<stockfisch>	@mjbrooks: right, i want to place an encrypted file in there. since fat32 does not handle large files i am going to use ext3 for it
[positive]	[10:16]	<eck>	dorto: there is more than one type though
[positive]	[10:16]	<Fujitsu>	ExpositionOFEvil: /etc/apt/sources.list, but you should be able to deal with it in System->Administration->Software Sources.
[negative]	[10:16]	<aarmenaa>	I'm not sure how repository editing works, I know there's a text file for it somewhere.
[neutral]	[10:16]	<Jordan_U>	ExpositionOFEvil, /etc/apt/sources.list
[negative]	[10:16]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	nah im in root =P
[positive]	[10:16]	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, and this is a usb thumb drive?
[negative]	[10:16]	<eck>	dorto: basically all laptops have them -- my laptop doesn't even have a cd drive, but it has a pcmcia slot
[negative]	[10:17]	<dorto>	eck: I want the card for a PC not a laptop
[positive]	[10:17]	<Fujitsu>	eck: Not many do these days... ExpressCard slots are much more common.
[positive]	[10:17]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	thanks
[positive]	[10:17]	<stockfisch>	"mjbrooks: no, not a thumb drive, a 3.5"" usb hdd drive"
[neutral]	[10:17]	<aarmenaa>	"Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says ""(alternate driver: rt73usb)"" even though rt73usb is blacklisted."

[neutral]	[10:17]	<Jordan_U>	dorto, Then go PCI
[negative]	[10:17]	<Fujitsu>	dorto: PCI cards are better.
[negative]	[10:17]	<dorto>	anyone knows if ASUS WL 167G is well supported by ubuntu?
[neutral]	[10:17]	<Tom47>	jijutm usually you can sot it out following the material in @HLINK
[negative]	[10:17]	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, just Truecrypt the whole thing
[neutral]	[10:17]	<gb__>	hi guys
[negative]	[10:17]	<Fujitsu>	stockfisch: You should probably use LUKS encryption, with ext3 over the top. That's what I do with my /home.
[negative]	[10:17]	<PurpZeY>	Fujitsu: It won't allow me to save changes to that file. . .
[neutral]	[10:17]	<[miles] >	El_Burro: hola
[positive]	[10:17]	<jijutm>	tom47: thanks will see to that now
[negative]	[10:17]	<dorto>	Jordan_U, USB network cards are so easy to maintain, I am using them on windows, but they don't work on gnu/linux
[positive]	[10:17]	<[miles] >	El_Burro: nice nick :-)
[neutral]	[10:17]	<Fujitsu>	PurpZeY: Stick sudo in front of the command you're using to edit it.
[neutral]	[10:18]	<Jordan_U>	!sudo | PurpZeY
[positive]	[10:18]	<ubotu>	"PurpZeY: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges (""root""). Look at @HLINK for all information."
[negative]	[10:18]	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: thumb drives don't always report the correct filesystem type
[positive]	[10:18]	<Fujitsu>	dorto: That's actually a circumstance where the GNU/ is inappropriate :P
[negative]	[10:18]	<El_Burro>	[miles] :cheers
[negative]	[10:18]	<Fujitsu>	Skiptest: Er, why not?
[negative]	[10:18]	<[miles] >	the donkey eh

[neutral]	[10:18]	<aarmenaa>	"Need help with modprobe and Ndiswrapper: Ndiswrapper says ""(alternate driver: rt73usb)"" even though rt73usb is blacklisted."
[neutral]	[10:18]	<stockfisch>	mjbrooks: i need this drive to have it to friends computers. i need the compatibility with windows. will it achieve that?
[negative]	[10:18]	<Jordan_U>	dorto, They take more power, take CPU, usually have less functions and aren't as well supported in Linux
[negative]	[10:18]	<mjbrooks>	Skiptest, with Truecypt it won't be any filesystem type,  just random data
[neutral]	[10:18]	<Fujitsu>	aarmenaa: Please wait a little longer between each question.
[negative]	[10:19]	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: i've tried commenting  exit 0, booting now
[negative]	[10:19]	<aarmenaa>	Sorry
[neutral]	[10:19]	<[miles] >	El_Burro: you spanish?
[negative]	[10:19]	<El_Burro>	nope
[positive]	[10:19]	<mjbrooks>	stockfisch, Truecrypt is has a nice GUI for windows   a linux gui is on the way
[neutral]	[10:19]	<freakabcd>	hi all
[negative]	[10:19]	<eck>	Fujitsu: and i thought i had a pcmcia slot this whole time...
[negative]	[10:19]	<BeBraw>	what could be the reason that feisty install cd gives blank screen (does not respond) after loading a while when i try to install it?
[negative]	[10:20]	<[miles] >	El_Burro: im sat here in barcelona lol ... thought with your spanish nick, well, u'd be spanish
[negative]	[10:20]	<Bouboule>	Blubloblu... I restart the computer after changing the line ... (suspens)
[negative]	[10:20]	<Fujitsu>	eck: It might be PCMCIA, but anything within the last year or two should be ExpressCard.
[negative]	[10:20]	<tdn>	What does this error mean: FATAL: fglX11FreeBuffer: firegl_FreeBuffer() failed! I only get 187 hits on Google. Nothing says much.
[neutral]	[10:20]	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: doesnt help
[neutral]	[10:20]	<stockfisch>	ill have a look at it
[negative]	[10:20]	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: depends, if it's the entire disk or not, a file on a filesystem
[negative]	[10:20]	<Blubloblu>	Bouboule: same problem
[neutral]	[10:20]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	yay
[neutral]	[10:20]	<Bouboule>	mmh
[negative]	[10:20]	<freakabcd>	if I upgrade from edgy -> feisty using the update-manager thingy from the menu, it will still save the packages in /var/cache/apt/... right?
[neutral]	[10:20]	<stockfisch>	THX@all
[positive]	[10:20]	<eck>	Fujitsu: no, i just looked it up and it is definitely expresscard based on the form factor
[neutral]	[10:20]	<Fujitsu>	ExpositionOFEvil: Does it work?
[neutral]	[10:20]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	after using 3 cds and 30 hours I finally got a chance to install ubuntu!
[neutral]	[10:20]	<[miles] >	does anyone know enterprise bookmarks server?
[negative]	[10:20]	<Fujitsu>	eck: Yep, it's pretty obvious once you look at it.
[neutral]	[10:20]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	wohoooo
[neutral]	[10:20]	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: That's correct.
[negative]	[10:20]	<freakabcd>	cos i am going to upgrade my laptop and then use the packages to upgrade my other machine as well
[positive]	[10:20]	<mjbrooks>	Skiptest, I've done both a file and a filesystem and accessed them from both windows and linux
[positive]	[10:21]	<El_Burro>	[miles] : Barcelona is a great city
[neutral]	[10:21]	<freakabcd>	And is there any limit on the size of /var/cache/apt/... ?

[neutral]	[10:21]	<ardchoille>	Anyone getting that?
[negative]	[10:21]	<Jordan_U>	freakabcd, Yes, but that doesn't mean you will be able to revert to the previous packages
[positive]	[10:21]	<Skiptest>	mjbrooks: haven't tried TC in Linux
[negative]	[10:21]	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: you could download the 7.04 alternate CD, and use that. That's more reliable.
[neutral]	[10:21]	<[miles] >	El_Burro: aye.. I prefer Valencia my self...
[negative]	[10:21]	<freakabcd>	cos i don;t want it to delete packages cos it went over some quota or something
[positive]	[10:21]	<[miles] >	El_Burro: but it beats the UK ;)
[negative]	[10:21]	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: Not unless you run out of disk space.
[neutral]	[10:21]	<freakabcd>	Jordan_U, previous packages?

[positive]	[10:21]	<mjbrooks>	Skiptest, it works,   no friendly gui, but it works
[positive]	[10:21]	<ExpositionOFEvil>	=)
[positive]	[10:21]	<dorto>	fujitsu, i was talking about distributions - windows and gnu/linux as I see them. can't care less if actually the underlying windows kernel and linux have to support the cards :)
[negative]	[10:21]	<Fujitsu>	freakabcd: It won't delete stuff unless you tell it to.

[negative]	[10:22]	<PurpZeY>	Fujistu: sudoedit ...xorg.conf added one line and now I want to save and quit

[negative]	[10:28]	<underwatercow>	I am trying to access files on a linux machine from a windows machine. I have a golder shared, but when I try and connect from windows it asks for a password. How do I fix this?

[neutral]	[10:28]	<PurpZeY>	Anyone know why a particular them would load, show up on the login and then bring me to human once I am logged in?
[negative]	[10:28]	<Fujitsu>	underwatercow: Run smbpasswd in a terminal, and use the password you set there.

[negative]	[10:29]	<underwatercow>	Fujitsu: is there no way to disable the password altogether?
[negative]	[10:29]	<Fujitsu>	frandavid100: It's unlikely that that would cause it.

[negative]	[10:41]	<noob_>	oh also i am using fiesty
[neutral]	[10:41]	<underwatercow>	blocky: it means you are using restricted drivers, namely ones that are probably close source
[negative]	[10:42]	<Skiptest>	underwatercow: I doubt a kernel would boot on top of an NTFS  filesystem, like the old umsdos days of yore...

[neutral]	[10:44]	<eck>	ceil420: you still need to compile it yourself, but this way you will have all the dev headers so the configure script won't fail

[negative]	[11:24]	<Huffalump>	I need help getting the nvidia driver to work under Feisty, please.  It is my 3rd day working on this problem and, so far, nothing has worked.  Previously it was a wfb problem, but I believe that is solved.  Currently, the problem seems to be with an API mismatch.
[neutral]	[11:24]	<calculator>	SubMOA: i think when i was playing around with iso burning programs (i.e. magicISO), it changed the iso file
[neutral]	[11:24]	<ahmed>	????????
[negative]	[11:24]	<calamari>	iMilad: if that works okay, then it can be set up to allow the normal user to have access as well (this is done in /etc/fstab)
[positive]	[11:24]	<PirateHead>	*is* there a way to rollback to the previous version of Ubuntu? I would really like to at this point.

[neutral]	[11:25]	<PirateHead>	seravitae: Right.
[neutral]	[11:25]	<Huffalump>	yannick, that is my current work around.  However, I want to use nvidia.
[negative]	[11:25]	<seravitae>	well, ive been here for about 1 minute and so far 3 people have feisty problems. i'm not updating.
[neutral]	[11:25]	<yannick>	Huffalump: what is the card name?
[negative]	[11:26]	<Huffalump>	seravitae, if your current install works, just wait.
[negative]	[11:26]	<mjbrooks>	Huffalump, for API mismatch remove the nvidia-glx package then reinstall it
[negative]	[11:26]	<Liber>	dthacker: Yeah, network doesn't work.  I tried changing the config file to match the network config file that displays when the LiveCD is running, since the Live Cd works... but everytime I open network it rewrites it again.  The wierd thing is that GRUB lists the previous version, but doesn't load it when selected.  However, as soon as it IS selected, the PC connects to the router.  So I'm making the Logical (to me) assumption that it's a conflict
[negative]	[11:26]	<Liber>	somewhere in the configuration.
[positive]	[11:26]	<seravitae>	my current install is great, so im not touching it.

[negative]	[11:26]	<Huffalump>	jbrooks, I've done that 3 or 4 times, but I am not opposed to trying it yet again.
[negative]	[11:26]	<Liber>	dthacker:  I mean, network opens, but it doesn't configure a connection succesfully.
[positive]	[11:26]	<Huffalump>	yannick, GeForce FX 5600 (tried with both nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-new which should work)

[positive]	[11:28]	<mjbrooks>	Huffalump, interesting   because it's been happening all day today   but it has never happened before
[negative]	[11:28]	<calamari>	cherva_: usually you don't need to install the nvidia driver manually.
[positive]	[11:28]	<Huffalump>	mjbrooks, when highlighted on XChat, your m becomes a square
[negative]	[11:29]	<sanityx>	God I hate ATI.

[positive]	[11:31]	<Huffalump>	How can I solve an API mismatch?  I had understood previously that I would need to remove all linux-restricted-* modules (and related bits) as well as all nvidia-* modules.  Make sure xorg.conf was set to nv.  Reboot.  Install nvidia-glx and linux-restricted*, change xorg.conf to nvidia, reboot.  But it gives an API mismatch after several different attempts at this.

[negative]	[11:55]	<Liber>	Huffalump:  I restarted.  It was my tragic mistake.  The upgrade didn;t work, then it did, and everything was upgraded, and everything still worked.  And then I restarted.  And now it's broken.
[negative]	[11:55]	<yagami>	thanks guys. am apt-getting rtorrent now. i've tried with btdownloadcurses. not good enough- or atleast not with my connection.

[positive]	[11:55]	<aatdark>	Agrajag: is there any chanceh that there will be one ?
[negative]	[11:55]	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, then it's all standard.  heck, just close the window and if it's not saved it will ask you
[negative]	[11:55]	<Agrajag>	aatdark: I doubt it.

[negative]	[11:56]	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, then it's probably already saved.  close the window.  if prompted, save.  if not, you're good.
[negative]	[11:56]	<Agrajag>	aatdark: Since the plugin is closed-source, there's nothing much that can be done besdies writing to Adobe and asking for an AMD64 port

[neutral]	[11:57]	<aatdark>	Agrajag: but isn't there an opensource port from the suse guys ?

[negative]	[11:57]	<aatdark>	Agrajag: that a good idee ,but how can i install an x86 browser with apt ?

[neutral]	[11:58]	<dmhouse>	Hey there. I'm upgrading to 7.04. I had assumed I was on the latest-but-one version, but it turned out that Dapper (which I currently have) was succeeded by Edgy. I missed that entire release cycle. In the future, where can I find out about Ubuntu releases? Is there a mailing list?
[neutral]	[11:58]	<_trine>	anyone on here know why I cant move open windows around with my mouse unless I press the alt key,,
[neutral]	[11:58]	<fortitUs>	hey
[negative]	[11:58]	<Agrajag>	aatdark: there's a couple different ways. Back when I tried using a 64-bit OS I used a chroot and loaded a 32-bit userland there, the entire OS. I'd suggest looking on the forums for HOWTOs on this stuff
[neutral]	[11:58]	<mrcreativity>	done...let me try it

[negative]	[12:01]	<peter77>	why is everyone switching to opera, is firefox on linux really that bad?
[positive]	[12:01]	<fortitUs>	namelessname: i am used to Opera already :P use it like mad on Windows
[neutral]	[12:02]	<Pat__>	Is there a specific channel for help with upgrade?
[positive]	[12:02]	<dmhouse>	Huffalump, bgrupe: thanks though, I'll check back in October. :)
[neutral]	[12:02]	<Horscht>	!sound
[negative]	[12:02]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[neutral]	[12:02]	<Liber>	peter77: Opera is faster, imo.
[positive]	[12:02]	<namelessname>	fortitUs: fine by me :)
[positive]	[12:02]	<peter77>	Liber, I know, it's also a lot more stable :-)
[neutral]	[12:02]	<mrcreativity>	it works....thanks guys
[positive]	[12:02]	<Huffalump>	Horscht, what in particular is your problem?  I may not be able to help you, but with sufficient details, someone may pick up on it.
[negative]	[12:02]	<xq>	Pat__: Now that it's officially the release, this would be it. Ask away.
[negative]	[12:02]	<fortitUs>	1 more thing... is there a good music player for Linux that has inbuilt mp3  support?
[neutral]	[12:02]	<Huffalump>	cool, mrcreativity!
[negative]	[12:02]	<Horscht>	Huffalump, i get no sound
[neutral]	[12:02]	<mrcreativity>	i have a few more questions
[neutral]	[12:03]	<mrcreativity>	first, is there anyway to auto logon?
[positive]	[12:03]	<Liber>	fortitus:  VLC media player is wonderful
[negative]	[12:03]	<Horscht>	that's my problem. I have a Realtek AC97
[negative]	[12:03]	<namelessname>	fortitUs: yeah, allot
[negative]	[12:03]	<Pat__>	xq, I keep getting this error: Failed to fetch @HLINK Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
[neutral]	[12:03]	<Huffalump>	Horscht, in your Volume Control, which device is chosen?
[negative]	[12:03]	<fortitUs>	i was thinking of Itunes
[neutral]	[12:03]	<fortitUs>	iTunes*
[negative]	[12:03]	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, and defeat the whole purpose of security?!
[negative]	[12:03]	<Liber>	how do you check the filesystem for errors?  Is there a ubuntu equivilent for window's scandisk?
[negative]	[12:03]	<mrcreativity>	well, i use it at home
[neutral]	[12:03]	<xq>	All have built in mp3 support (and a lot more) basically, you just need the right codecs which most packages (specially in the upgrade tool/packaging tool provided) will auto download upon the installation of your first mp3 app.
[positive]	[12:04]	<xq>	iTunes support?
[negative]	[12:04]	<fortitUs>	no idea o_o?
[positive]	[12:04]	<namelessname>	fortitUs: I don't know if iTunes is available for Linux, but I do know that XMMS or Audacious are great players. If you require MP3 support, you should ask Google, there's allot available :)
[neutral]	[12:04]	<askar>	firefox doesnt save my settings in feisty..why?
[neutral]	[12:04]	<Horscht>	Intel 82801DB-ICH4 (alsa Mixer) Huffalump

[negative]	[12:05]	<xq>	blu2: It depends if it supports it. Do you know if your display/monitor support what you are trying to use?
[neutral]	[12:05]	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, will this machine be on the internet?
[negative]	[12:05]	<xq>	Pat__: That doesn't look like a correct path
[neutral]	[12:06]	<xq>	Pat__: And definitely you don't need a text file. Want a link for a good mirror? United States?

[neutral]	[12:38]	<Agrajag>	Shauny: a .so is the unix-world equivalent of a DLL, it's not something you can just edit.

[neutral]	[12:41]	<mneptok>	mrcreativity: ach so.
[negative]	[12:42]	<Ravenheart>	hey, i'm new to linux, can i ask you some questions
[neutral]	[12:42]	<Huffalump>	mrcreativity, add/remove programs & Synaptic are basically happy smiley interfaces for apt-get.  I'm a GUI person myself, but I've learned that knowing apt-get can be really helpful.
[positive]	[12:42]	<mneptok>	mrcreativity: is Xubuntu next? :)
[neutral]	[12:42]	<Vinitious>	Huffalump: yes your right, but is asked the wrong question, vmware can work on Feisty, but the vmware tools have a problem (which is a pain because it's much to slow and the mouse does not function properly without it)
[negative]	[12:42]	<anarchris>	do you know where I can get a 64 bit libdvdcs .deb?
[neutral]	[12:42]	<shiv_j>	lisapc: I have not used 7.04 yet
[neutral]	[12:42]	<vm>	is there a program to unrar files in linux?

[negative]	[01:10]	<LjL>	cherva: what is the output of  apt-cache policy nvidia-glx ? and while you're at it, could could just paste your entire /etc/apt/sources.list

[negative]	[01:10]	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  how is it coming with Vista and Gparted?  You saw an unallocated space that concerned you?  What is that space supposed to be?  And does your Vista report it the same way gparted does?
[neutral]	[01:10]	<scapor>	noob_: open that folder and click the exe file
[neutral]	[01:10]	<peteremc1>	hey thanks Huffalump
[neutral]	[01:11]	<peteremc1>	im on the live cd

[negative]	[01:11]	<Heroin>	Ravenheart iam pretty sure.. u could check the website of gparted..
[negative]	[01:11]	<rambo3>	kerik, that not a real question
[positive]	[01:11]	<scapor>	"noob_: you can create a ""Starter"" or menu item to it with as command ""wine /path/to/itunes.exe"" or I think ""gnome-open /path/to/itunes.exe"" would work too"
[negative]	[01:11]	<foug>	i just installed a program with wine and now it won't open. help eh?
[negative]	[01:11]	<peteremc1>	but when i go to gparted, it says the whole C: is unallocated
[negative]	[01:11]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: yes, a bad experience
[positive]	[01:11]	<yagami>	Heroin: heh. i am tempted to say 'duh', but will resist :)
[positive]	[01:11]	<kerik>	rambo3: true... :)
[neutral]	[01:11]	<LjL>	christine_: you need to know what is starting the frontend... if you type  ps aux | grep myth , what shows up?
[neutral]	[01:11]	<peteremc1>	"and only allows me to choose ""New"" (which would wipe everything)"
[neutral]	[01:11]	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  so your Vista partition is 93G which Gparted is reporting as unallocated?
[negative]	[01:11]	<kpel>	kerik: just make sure to back up your /etc and your /home . some packages don't seem to work in feisty
[neutral]	[01:11]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: ok...what happened?

[negative]	[01:13]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: very annoying, i'm a bit lost too. I dont see how I can fix it

[positive]	[01:15]	<scapor>	When installing Feisty, on the live CD all worked fine, but once in my installed system, both my mouse and keyboard (both USB) are very slow, both in X as on the terminals ... is there afix for this problem known ? Someone ?

[neutral]	[01:15]	<jrib>	noob_: rhythmbox is installed by default
[negative]	[01:15]	<nielsm>	wow, on my newly installed amd64 system (i have a number of ata and sata disks, winxp on hda1, installed feisty on hdc1) grub fails to boot. running grub from the livecd is useless, it doesn't seem to be able to do anything (find fails immediately, root fails for any parameters). i tried chroot'ing to my install and setting up lilo, which also fails to install itself

[neutral]	[01:16]	<mesiah>	Hello there!
[negative]	[01:16]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: gee...that doesn't exactly make it any easier!
[neutral]	[01:16]	<Lukemob>	Guys, how to solve it? Read-only filesystem
[neutral]	[01:16]	<Paul_UK>	jrib: only desktop and home folders
[neutral]	[01:16]	<jrib>	Lukemob: what filesystem?
[negative]	[01:16]	<LjL>	nielsm: grub shouldn't fail installing, if used from the live CD - however, you'll need to mount your (real) root partition somewhere, and then call grub-install with the approrpiate parameters
[negative]	[01:16]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: so even if theres a driver, I cant install it

[negative]	[01:16]	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  yeah, I see much of the same.  While I'm poking around for something reliable, as a pragmatic issue... why were we not using the Vista Disk Manager? Just because?  I don't care really, but I was curious.
[negative]	[01:16]	<nielsm>	LjL: that's not the problem, grub fails with error 17 or 18 (can't remember right now)
[neutral]	[01:16]	<LjL>	cherva: shouldn't be needed
[negative]	[01:16]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: right now I'd be happy if I got vesa working in 1600x1200
[positive]	[01:17]	<jrib>	Paul_UK: don't know then, maybe someone else can help, but be sure you mention it's a windows share when you repeat your question in a bit :)
[positive]	[01:17]	<kpel>	those packages depend on ca-certificates and that package is somewhat broken for now
[neutral]	[01:17]	<cherva>	LjL: k thx
[negative]	[01:17]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: is that due to a bad driver for your lan or?
[negative]	[01:17]	<illJazz>	I downloaded VLC, tried Kaffeiene as well as the built-in movie player that comes with Feisty Fawn.. but nothing will play sound on my AVI video files :/
[positive]	[01:17]	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  you can do that, but we're more likely to pick up help from others if we keep the chatter here.

[neutral]	[01:17]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: darn...
[positive]	[01:17]	<peteremc1>	ok, no prob... i was having problems with the vista partitioner so it was suggested in here i use the one on the livecd :D

[negative]	[01:18]	<kerik>	kpel: that's just a beach
[negative]	[01:18]	<peteremc1>	in vista, it was only letting me shrink the partition by 16MB...
[negative]	[01:18]	<nielsm>	"when i run grub from the livecd it seems to work, but there is no readline support, running ""root"" on any device fails, ""find"" fails immediately without even seeming to try"
[positive]	[01:18]	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  I am hoping we might get you some help on Gparted and Vista from folks like LjL or jrib who have much more knowledge than I do.
[positive]	[01:18]	<peteremc1>	i decided that wasn't enough for my new ubuntu installation :P

[neutral]	[01:18]	<Ianman>	hi everyone
[negative]	[01:18]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: Do you think installing feisty from the cd and wiping my disk would be a good idea?
[negative]	[01:18]	<Huffalump>	peteremc1,  16 megs would be a little short. heh.
[negative]	[01:18]	<Lukemob>	jrib, any idea?
[negative]	[01:19]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: I must admit that I have had the same idea....

[negative]	[01:19]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: I'm not at all an expert on linux, but in my logic that would clean out all old/bad drivers...

[neutral]	[01:30]	<brandon^>	i have a question, reguarding dual booting linux/windows, pm me if you can help
[neutral]	[01:30]	<Huffalump>	atomiku, you like!
[positive]	[01:30]	<jonah>	eztk: no, its a fresh install, GRUB was just very confused about which drive was which.. and im a n00b, so it took almost a day to figure it out..
[neutral]	[01:30]	<Huffalump>	atomiku, you lie!
[neutral]	[01:30]	<rambo3>	claudiu, gnome-rdp
[negative]	[01:30]	<LjL>	jinzo: well then try  sudo dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -P courier-authdaemon , that seems to be the #1 proposed solution, though it's not reported to always work either
[negative]	[01:30]	<Ianman>	noob_: yeah I have
[negative]	[01:31]	<eztk>	jonah: ok
[negative]	[01:31]	<Huffalump>	atomiku, ah... a reinstall.  Well, I'm still hoping to avoid that. :{
[negative]	[01:31]	<tarelerulz>	it would seem I don't have that command is says
[negative]	[01:31]	<Paul_UK>	eztk: you got office 2003 running with crosslinux?
[positive]	[01:31]	<kippi>	with cairo-dock I am getting a big black boder round it, does anyone know how to get rid off this?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<jrib>	Erebus: try #winehq
[neutral]	[01:31]	<LjL>	!pm > brandon^    (brandon^, see the private message from Ubotu)
[negative]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	Huffalump: Hard to avoid I guess
[negative]	[01:31]	<jinzo>	LjL, did it, didn't work
[positive]	[01:31]	<noob_>	lanman i find it often stops responding
[negative]	[01:31]	<Erebus>	Hi all - I have a question - how do I point Wine'd apps to a proxy? (Specifically WoW)
[negative]	[01:31]	<chowmeined>	If I want to raid 1 two partitions do they have to be exactly the same size?
[positive]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	Huffalump: Unless you want to spend hours trying to fix it: :P
[negative]	[01:31]	<Erebus>	Also, can someone recommend a decent mirc-like IRC client for ubuntu?
[negative]	[01:31]	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, then you do not have ssh server installed ...
[neutral]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	Erebus: xchat.
[neutral]	[01:31]	<jrib>	Erebus: xchat
[neutral]	[01:31]	<Ianman>	Er
[negative]	[01:31]	<chowmeined>	I am trying to but I can't seem to make them have the same amount of sectors exactly
[negative]	[01:31]	<Huffalump>	eztk, you mean CrossLinux like a Wine-ish thing?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	jrib: High five! o/
[neutral]	[01:31]	<Ianman>	Erebus: Gaim...
[neutral]	[01:31]	<jinzo>	LjL, i'll go with removing it from status
[neutral]	[01:31]	<Itchy>	Paul_UK: OO.o is not as good as MS office, but the biggest issue honestly is the fact the MS office doesnt support open document format, and that .doc is not supported very very well by Open Office, since .doc is prprietary.
[neutral]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	Eww
[negative]	[01:31]	<claudiu>	rambo3: desktop sharing is not enabled , how can i activate it by CLI ?
[negative]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	Ianman: gaim is horrible for IRC
[negative]	[01:31]	<eztk>	Paul_UK: I haven't tried, but I believe it will work. I might get Office 2007 as its only 20 quid, and see if I can get it to work with CrossLinux
[positive]	[01:31]	<Erebus>	Thanks - and wine/WoW through a proxy
[neutral]	[01:31]	<Ianman>	using it right now...no worries
[negative]	[01:31]	<atomiku>	Ianman: ugh
[negative]	[01:32]	<tarelerulz>	could it be the ex is named something else ?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<eztk>	huffalump: I believe its like Wine, but far more user friendly apparently
[negative]	[01:32]	<atomiku>	Im using XFCE on ubuntu 7.04 but some of the icons are messed up, how can i fix this?
[negative]	[01:32]	<Ianman>	oh
[neutral]	[01:32]	<Ianman>	mkay
[negative]	[01:32]	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, whats ex ?
[negative]	[01:32]	<alvaro>	anyone knows if i can installl shockwave pulg-in for firefox in ubuntu ?
[negative]	[01:32]	<LjL>	jinzo: then i'd try the solution by Fedearne next
[neutral]	[01:32]	<chowmeined>	OO.o is very slow too
[neutral]	[01:32]	<Huffalump>	eztk, I've heard distant rumblings about it, I think. Cedega and something (CrossLinux).
[negative]	[01:32]	<claudiu>	desktop sharing is not enabled , how can i activate it by CLI ?
[negative]	[01:32]	<Paul_UK>	eztk: ok, well i couldnt get it to work and apparently crossover 6.0.1  only rated to office 2000 LOL!!!!!
[negative]	[01:32]	<wolfspirit>	question for the room.. is it sage to hit the upgrade button or am I going to have some issues upgrading to fiesty that way?  I've read stories about previous upgrades failing.
[neutral]	[01:32]	<tarelerulz>	exaqcutble or  how ever you spell it
[neutral]	[01:32]	<kerik>	POVaddct: hey
[negative]	[01:32]	<eztk>	"there must be someone here who knows how to fix the buggered up kernal problem which leads to feisty leaving my machine unbootable?? ""waiting for root file system"" -- hangs then drops to busy box :("
[negative]	[01:32]	<pjesi>	LjL: there is no ./configure, is this a problem?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: Well, my upgrade f'd everything up
[positive]	[01:32]	<omaaaar>	who has a sagem f@st 800 modem?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<Huffalump>	"Paul_UK, what's different between Office 2K and 2K3 that you need?  ""need!"""
[neutral]	[01:33]	<eztk>	paul_UK: interesting
[negative]	[01:33]	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: So... If you wanna risk it, hit the upgrade button
[neutral]	[01:33]	<Itchy>	Paul_UK dont use crossover. use wine directly; The wine documentation is good enough.
[negative]	[01:33]	<LjL>	jinzo: uhm, i'm not particularly fond of the idea of removing it from status... but then i don't really know anything to say for sure
[positive]	[01:33]	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump: Simple, I have a licence for 2003
[negative]	[01:33]	<Azureday>	alvaro:It can be installed automaticly when you browsing a page with flash.
[neutral]	[01:33]	<wolfspirit>	atomiku: great.. so did you have to do a fresh install after that I suppose?
[neutral]	[01:33]	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: yup
[negative]	[01:33]	<jinzo>	LjL, then i'll first try the Fedearne, then we will see
[negative]	[01:33]	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, I found that WINE worked pretty good for things I needed.  It was not *easy* in every case, but it did work.
[negative]	[01:33]	<LjL>	"pjesi: yes and no... there doesn't *have* to be a configure, but most programs do have one. read the INSTALL file (there is one, right?), if it just tells you to type ""make"" straight away, try that"
[negative]	[01:33]	<eztk>	wolfspirit: the lovely upgrade button has killed my system. that's why im here :(
[negative]	[01:33]	<atomiku>	wolfspirit: I spent a whole day trying to fix everything that had broken, until I finaly realized it was time to start again
[negative]	[01:33]	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump:  plus its just better, more stable, more functions, etc, etc.....
[negative]	[01:33]	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, have you installed this package 'ssh' ?? btw pls search in synaptic for ssh server
[negative]	[01:33]	<eztk>	wolfspirit: the damn kernel cant even mount my root file system
[negative]	[01:34]	<atomiku>	eztk: yeah, it couldnt mount mine either
[negative]	[01:34]	<eztk>	atomiku: how did you fix it?
[negative]	[01:34]	<atomiku>	eztk: did ubuntu stop booting?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<atomiku>	I ment
[neutral]	[01:34]	<atomiku>	did it freeze at about 1%?
[negative]	[01:34]	<tarelerulz>	ok wickedpuppy
[neutral]	[01:34]	<xq>	SSH Server will be OpenSSH
[positive]	[01:34]	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, and pls put my nick in front if you are talking to me :P it get confusing
[negative]	[01:34]	<eztk>	atomiku: yeah!
[neutral]	[01:34]	<eztk>	atomiku: eventually throws me into busybox
[negative]	[01:34]	<alvaro>	Azureday, i already have flash installed but i need shockwave and did not find it :(
[positive]	[01:34]	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, true ... openssh-server is the package name
[neutral]	[01:34]	<eztk>	atomiku: apparently its a duff kernel ?!
[negative]	[01:34]	<atomiku>	eztk: I had the same problem. All I can suggest is that you get 7.04 on acd, and start again
[negative]	[01:34]	<LjL>	pjesi: oh, fine, no install instructions.
[negative]	[01:34]	<eztk>	atomiku: or bad mapping ?
[neutral]	[01:34]	<pjesi>	LjL: yes I know
[negative]	[01:34]	<atomiku>	eztk: I spent a whole day trying to fix it, with no luck
[negative]	[01:34]	<jinzo>	LjL, tried, but can't install courier-authlib because of dependencies problems :S
[neutral]	[01:34]	<eztk>	atomiku: reinstall ???
[positive]	[01:34]	<brandon^>	 Can i install ubuntu on a different hard drive rather than a different partition on the same hard drive i run windows on.
[positive]	[01:34]	<nielsm>	hah! i managed to install lilo, now to see if it'll boot :D
[neutral]	[01:35]	<tarelerulz>	<wickedpuppy> ,  well I will try to do that
[neutral]	[01:35]	<atomiku>	eztk: Yup, reinstall.
[neutral]	[01:35]	<xq>	Yes, brandon
[positive]	[01:35]	<Ianman>	atomiku: yeah I guess xchat is better ;)
[negative]	[01:35]	<Itchy>	"Paul_UK: you wont get ""more"" anything by running things in any ""emulator"". and damn if wine is not an emulator i dunno."
[positive]	[01:35]	<atomiku>	Ianman: :)
[positive]	[01:35]	<Huffalump>	"Paul_UK, well I think this thread started when you made the assertion that Ubuntu was ready to replace XP and I asserted that it was ;)  It may not be ready for primetime running of Microsoft's ""We only work on Windows"" Office which is purposefully designed to be OS-specific.  But you can hardly blame ubuntu for that.  Anyway, I say it is ready for primetime and there are many compatible solutions for many people's needs.  Apparently, your needs may"
[negative]	[01:35]	<Huffalump>	not be met at this time and I can totally empathize with that.
[negative]	[01:35]	<xq>	Then just modify your MBR using the utility included to dual boot
[negative]	[01:35]	<eztk>	atomiku: ohh no.. NOT again :((((( i had to do similar when I did dapper > edgy
[negative]	[01:35]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: dont you find it ironic, that to get a driver for a internet device, you need to download it off the internet?
[neutral]	[01:35]	<xq>	lol
[negative]	[01:35]	<wolfspirit>	question for the whole room:  Has anyone successfully upgraded to fiesty and I'm not talking about a fresh install.  If so, do you have a link to the instructions you followed?
[negative]	[01:35]	<nielsm>	i installed ubuntu on a different drive and now i'm having these huge problems making anything boot at all :( (i don't know if it's a general problem though)
[neutral]	[01:35]	<Ianman>	lol
[negative]	[01:35]	<LjL>	jinzo: give me the output of it all
[positive]	[01:35]	<eztk>	atomiku: good job i moved /home to a separate partition... given what happened last time
[negative]	[01:36]	<jinzo>	LjL, it's borked, how do i change the msgs it outputs to english ?
[positive]	[01:36]	<Itchy>	Huffalump: i thought the Mac people had Office as well ?!
[negative]	[01:36]	<compwiz18>	I'm having trouble with fglrx on Feisty... can someone give me a hand?
[negative]	[01:36]	<eztk>	atomiku: why cant they make this damn upgrade work properly??? they might as well rename the button [REINSTALL] 
[neutral]	[01:36]	<rambo3>	nielsm, make /boot/ on first disk and / on second drive
[negative]	[01:36]	<nielsm>	and now to boot again.... (and i just got rhythbox working again! damn)
[positive]	[01:36]	<Paul_UK>	Huffalump, i disagree with your statement that its ready to replace windows..  where is the replacement for winamp or foobar player, for starters.
[negative]	[01:36]	<mwe>	nielsm: I don't think it's related to the fact that's it's installed on a different hdd
[negative]	[01:36]	<jinzo>	LjL, i think i got it fixed
[negative]	[01:36]	<tarelerulz>	 Well, wackedpuppy I am going to install open-ssh-sever
[negative]	[01:36]	<LjL>	pjesi: did you already do  sudo apt-get install swig ? that's the first thing it complains about here
[negative]	[01:36]	<pmMike>	hi, my login screen is showing up at a stupidly high resolution (but zoomed on one corner) and i can just about log into my account where te resolution goes back down to normal. I've had a look in the xorg.conf file and it's only got my native resolutions in there. What should I do to fix this?
[neutral]	[01:36]	<jinzo>	executed dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -P courier-authdaemon
[positive]	[01:36]	<brandon^>	does ubuntu support 2560x1600 resolution?
[negative]	[01:36]	<mwe>	nielsm: do you know the linux names of the drives?
[negative]	[01:36]	<Itchy>	Paul_UK: there are more replacements for winamp than you know !
[negative]	[01:36]	<Itchy>	and winamp sucks !
[neutral]	[01:36]	<omaaaar>	nobody tried speedtouch with feisty?
[negative]	[01:36]	<eztk>	atomiku: is it not possible to upgrade the install through live CD?
[negative]	[01:36]	<xq>	Paul_UK: There are better replacements for audio products (on the gui) in Linux. But, when it comes down to it, it's up to taste.
[positive]	[01:37]	<Huffalump>	Itchy - Microsoft dropped Mac support like a hot potato.  They abandoned both IE and Office and some other cruft.  Windows Media Player, if memory serves.  They only launch Mac stuff for a very short while and then leave everyone hanging on purpose to push changeover to Windows.  Think like a drug dealer; the first hit is free.
[negative]	[01:37]	<Paul_UK>	Itchy. hence why i said foobar player lol
[negative]	[01:37]	<LjL>	jinzo: good (anyway what's the language, if it's not too weird i should be able to guess the messages)
[neutral]	[01:37]	<eztk>	does everyone agree that I need to reinstall?!?
[negative]	[01:37]	<mwe>	nielsm: if it's ide they're probably hda and hdb or something like that
[neutral]	[01:37]	<atomiku>	eztk: Yup
[negative]	[01:37]	<wolfspirit>	brandon^: as long as your hardware supports it
[neutral]	[01:37]	<xq>	Paul_UK: There are a -ton- of WinAMP-like (+better functioning) in Linux.
[negative]	[01:37]	<eztk>	atomiku: and do you know what caused this problem?
[negative]	[01:37]	<pjesi>	LjL: yeah I got pretty far
[neutral]	[01:37]	<noob_>	<noob>
[neutral]	[01:37]	<benhetfield>	salut tout le monde
[positive]	[01:37]	<brandon^>	 it does :D
[positive]	[01:37]	<jinzo>	"LjL, so with a combination of Fedearne ""fix"" and udo dpkg --force-remove-reinstreq -P courier-authdaemon"
[neutral]	[01:37]	<eztk>	paul_uk: xmms
[positive]	[01:37]	<kerik>	Blubloblu: I have had the very same thought a lot of times :)
[negative]	[01:37]	<joeri>	i just updated my update-manager on edgy, and now i doesnt propose me anymore the update to feisty... any hints?
[negative]	[01:37]	<atomiku>	eztk: Yup, the kernel is completely screwed
[negative]	[01:37]	<xq>	Paul_UK: I favor XMMS though.
[negative]	[01:37]	<jinzo>	LjL, nah msgs get cluttered, so i suspect it's because of the lang :S
[negative]	[01:37]	<pmMike>	hi, my login screen is showing up at a stupidly high resolution (but zoomed on one corner) and i can just about log into my account where te resolution goes back down to normal. I've had a look in the xorg.conf file and it's only got my native resolutions in there. What should I do to fix this?
[negative]	[01:37]	<Paul_UK>	eztk: so does that allow me to sync up my ipod tho?
[neutral]	[01:37]	<atomiku>	brb guys
[negative]	[01:37]	<LjL>	pjesi: then please give me the output of how far you've got, so i can try to see what's next
[positive]	[01:37]	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, I love VLC over any other media player.  However, most others like Rhythmbox and other iTunes-like stuff.
[negative]	[01:37]	<eztk>	atomiku: is there no way of upgrading the kernel?
[positive]	[01:37]	<atomiku>	eztk: good luck with the reinstall ;)
[neutral]	[01:38]	<Paul_UK>	I use VLC player, for both wxp and linux
[negative]	[01:38]	<eztk>	paul_uk: i dont have one, so i cant comment
[neutral]	[01:38]	<brandon^>	 does anyone like my pink?
[positive]	[01:38]	<nielsm>	IT'S BOOTING yay :D lilo worked :)

[neutral]	[01:38]	<pjesi>	LjL: yes I am compiling atm
[negative]	[01:38]	<claudiu>	Paul_UK: I want to connect by remote login to a feisty machine but the screen is black
[neutral]	[01:38]	<Paul_UK>	eztk: i've read that it doesnt
[positive]	[01:38]	<xq>	VLC is also up there with a nice piece of multimedia software
[positive]	[01:38]	<Blubloblu>	kerik: man, feisty is a pain in the ass!
[negative]	[01:38]	<Itchy>	Huffalump:yep, but if Mac people can run Windows on their Mac, then they gain something i beleive. Especially since apple is a more evil corp. than MS
[positive]	[01:38]	<Huffalump>	Paul_UK, yeah I use VLC on linux, Mac, and XP

[negative]	[01:46]	<Huffalump>	brandon^ basically, what happens for Flash & Java... is you end up installing FireFox twice  (default install is Fx64 and that's already there.... you add the second Fx32 which you can then use Flash and Java with).

[negative]	[01:47]	<Huffalump>	brandon^ I don't disagree with jrib.  It is correct that if you want the easiest environment, go with 32 because you won't have the few extra hassles.  But if you've got any interest in getting your fingers dirty then 64 isn't too tough.
[positive]	[01:47]	<wickedpuppy>	tarelerulz, which command ?

[negative]	[01:52]	<Huffalump>	brandon^ I believe that depends on the driver you install for your video, but there *is* some support for Quad SLI.  I am not an expert, but it does exist.
[negative]	[01:52]	<chowmeined>	The feisty alternate cd's installer just segfaulted while I was trying to make lvm volumes...

[neutral]	[01:52]	<tarelerulz>	<fiery_cleric> I seem to get in
[positive]	[01:52]	<fiery_cleric>	tarelerulz: so it works :) whats the problem
[neutral]	[01:52]	<slimaq>	anybody can help me?
[negative]	[01:52]	<PirateHead>	brandon^: Ubuntu does not support Quad SLI because the drivers for such a setup have not been worked out. You could set up a Quad SLI, but it would not give you the same performance boost. Huffalump says that there might be some support, and that's nice... I just haven't heard of it before.
[positive]	[01:52]	<ompaul>	Lorvija, ssh -X user@box /usr/bin/programname works

[negative]	[01:53]	<compwiz18>	anyone got any ideas on why Feisty hates me and my fglrx?  restricted-manager thinks I don't need to use any restricted drivers (the little sticker on the front of my lappy tells me otherwise, however) and it used to let me easily install fglrx...  my attempts to compile fglrx like I used to do in Edgy have failed miserably as well.  It refuses to use fglrx in favor of Mesa.

[positive]	[02:09]	<ubunt1>	i have ubuntu 7
[positive]	[02:10]	<RandomizeR>	"my nvidia card is acting weird, xorg.0.log says something about ""too many errors, falling back to legacy driver"" and anything with hardware acceleration closes right after opening :-/"
[negative]	[02:10]	<Lukemob>	Do I need to do something, if I want to add HDD?
[negative]	[02:10]	<RandomizeR>	nvidia 5200, using feisty but had the problem since edgy
[negative]	[02:10]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR what model is your video card
[negative]	[02:10]	<pjesi>	LjL: it doesn't look like much in that directory
[neutral]	[02:10]	<roberto-7>	hi all
[positive]	[02:10]	<RandomizeR>	at first i thought it was a problem with my system, but i just did a clean install and it's still there
[neutral]	[02:10]	<Stormx2>	Is there a gtk based database management system? Like Microsoft Access of Kexi?
[negative]	[02:10]	<trol0s>	anyone know how to change the port used by the integrated BitTorrent client?
[neutral]	[02:11]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: hmmm,did you install it correct.
[negative]	[02:11]	<rellik>	my sound is somewhat broken since the update. I have a playlist in amarok, but (literally) every other file fails to play.  the equalizer bars dance around, as if the song were playing, but there is no sound
[negative]	[02:11]	<ajehuk>	Erebus - I'm not all that familiar with how wine handles its networking, but I assume it simply passes everything off to the host, in which case I would look at configuring it within linux using an application-level proxy - thats about as much as I can suggest though - I have no other ideas...
[neutral]	[02:11]	<RandomizeR>	followed the guide
[neutral]	[02:11]	<ytsestef>	ello! i have troubles getting amarok to work in ubuntu feisty (x86), flac is not supported while, when i load an mp3 file it just hangs
[negative]	[02:11]	<ubunt1>	rellik did you try vlc
[neutral]	[02:11]	<yannick_>	nick nikkie13
[negative]	[02:11]	<delire>	beerockxs: yes, i'm afraid that will be the case.
[positive]	[02:11]	<trol0s>	lot's of ppl repeating themselves here :P
[negative]	[02:11]	<roberto-7>	i have a number of problems on desktop- effects on ubuntu7.4. is this the right place to ask questions?
[neutral]	[02:11]	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: do you understand bash?
[neutral]	[02:11]	<delire>	beerockxs: is this a laptop?
[negative]	[02:12]	<ytsestef>	in short: i can't play back any mp3 or flac or wav file in amarok!
[neutral]	[02:12]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, just go to the advance settings of your BitTornado
[neutral]	[02:12]	<ubunt1>	roberto-7: what happend
[neutral]	[02:12]	<delire>	ytsestef: can you play them in other applications?
[negative]	[02:12]	<RandomizeR>	"ubunt1: i followed the guide from the ""!nvidia"" link, so yeah i suppose it was installed correctly"
[neutral]	[02:13]	<yagami>	Hi, folks. I have shared a directory on my smb server and i want users on another computer running Windows to login with user and password set on the smb server
[negative]	[02:13]	<ubunt1>	roberto-7: i too have problems with effect in ubuntu 7,and i disable it,do you know that they are in beta.
[negative]	[02:13]	<leejohn>	good day guys, i have a acer aspire 5570 with Intel ALC883 audio, i have a problem with sound anyone care to assist me, thanks a lot
[negative]	[02:13]	<roberto-7>	i enable them.. sometine the desktop freezes completely!! no chanche to enter in any console on ctrl-alt bksp
[positive]	[02:13]	<yagami>	but when i double click the link, it gives the permission denied error
[negative]	[02:13]	<reiki>	anyone know how to change the label on a volume in Feisty?
[positive]	[02:13]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: but I don't use that.. but the simple integrated one.. don't know if I have BitTornado
[neutral]	[02:13]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: hmmm,sometime the guide from nvidia are incorrect
[neutral]	[02:13]	<ytsestef>	"delire: yes! amarok says there are no flac codecs. as for mp3, it pops up a message which asks me to install mp3 codecs and before i am able to click ""yes"" the application hangs"
[neutral]	[02:13]	<RandomizeR>	@HLINK
[positive]	[02:13]	<Erebus>	ajehuk: Thanks
[neutral]	[02:14]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, ubuntu default is BitTornado.  it pops up a window per torrent, right?
[negative]	[02:14]	<RandomizeR>	that's the xorg.0.log file
[positive]	[02:14]	<beerockxs>	delire: no, not a laptop. a desktop with a CRT and an LCD connected at the same time
[negative]	[02:14]	<beatrice>	"I have an AVI that VLC stops playing a few minutes in, even though I downloaded the whole thing. Is there a program to fix ""broken"" AVIs?"
[neutral]	[02:14]	<delire>	ytsestef: right, that isn't good. is your system updated?
[neutral]	[02:14]	<cherva>	LjL: back online with gui
[neutral]	[02:14]	<LjL>	cherva: and nvidia-glx based gui?
[negative]	[02:14]	<ubunt1>	beatrice: hmm i know to repair for windows
[neutral]	[02:14]	<delire>	beerockxs: ahah.. that's different. is it an ati card?
[neutral]	[02:14]	<Huffalump>	trol0s along the top of that small window is some blue, underlined links (I think 4).  One them is Settings/Preferences and it's in there you can set the ports (I stopped using it because I liked another one better)
[negative]	[02:14]	<cherva>	LjL: i'll try in a sec
[positive]	[02:14]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: yeah.. guess I'll look for BitTornado then =)
[negative]	[02:14]	<ytsestef>	i have just installed ubuntu 7.04 (clean install) it is upadated, i mean it was released 2 days ago!!
[negative]	[02:14]	<ubunt1>	beatrice: but i don't remember the program.
[positive]	[02:15]	<beerockxs>	delire: yes, using the fglrx driver and the bigdesktop option
[negative]	[02:15]	<ubunt1>	ytsestef: yes,and is it work,or not work.
[neutral]	[02:15]	<jonah>	hi guys having a bit of trouble, i deleted my default user to make a new one but now sudo and any admininstrative stuff not working
[negative]	[02:15]	<jonah>	messed up somewhere
[neutral]	[02:15]	<cherva>	LjL: u got skype ?
[neutral]	[02:15]	<jonah>	the new user i made can't takeover as the main one it seems
[positive]	[02:15]	<LjL>	cherva: no - and honestly i refuse to install that evil proprietary stuff :)
[negative]	[02:15]	<SoftIce>	hi, anyone know of a vserver kernel for ubuntu feisty ? or should I still continue to use the edgy vserver kernel ?
[negative]	[02:15]	<ytsestef>	ubunt1: what do you mean?
[negative]	[02:15]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: right now, the login screen starts with white rectangles all over, and as i said, hardware acceleration doesn't work
[negative]	[02:16]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, in case I wasn't clear.  You must have a torrent open at the time you want to modify the ports.  Counterintuitive for me, but that's how it works.
[positive]	[02:16]	<cherva>	LjL : :)
[negative]	[02:16]	<delire>	beerockxs: you'll need to look at support for TV out. can you paste you /etc/X11/xorg.conf in a pastebin?
[neutral]	[02:16]	<cherva>	LjL: restarting now
[negative]	[02:16]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: yeah on the BitTornado client I guess? Cause this small simplistic client doesn't have any settings option
[neutral]	[02:16]	<ubunt1>	ytsestef: some  times after update is not working.
[negative]	[02:16]	<Huffalump>	trol0s just a moment and I'll verify
[positive]	[02:16]	<trol0s>	thanks mate
[negative]	[02:16]	<beerockxs>	delire: uh, why tv out? In gnome, everything works fine, it's just gdm that's messed up. But yeah, I can pastebin it, give me second
[neutral]	[02:16]	<delire>	ytsestef: i don't know what to suggest here other than trying to install support for these codecs manually. look at the RestrictedFormats section of the help wiki
[neutral]	[02:16]	<sivaji_2009>	jrib yes
[positive]	[02:16]	<LjL>	pjesi: i've been able to build a Debian source package
[negative]	[02:16]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: did you try to see is there are disabled the options
[neutral]	[02:16]	<xukun_>	hi all
[positive]	[02:16]	<LjL>	pjesi: probably won't compile just like it didn't compile manually, but
[negative]	[02:16]	<delire>	beerockxs: how are you getting signal to the second monitor?
[neutral]	[02:17]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR:  try nvidia-settings
[neutral]	[02:17]	<pjesi>	LjL: well it is a start
[positive]	[02:17]	<pjesi>	LjL:  can you give my the command you used?
[neutral]	[02:17]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, the link says Prefs.  click it and it's in there.
[negative]	[02:17]	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: are there any workarounds for it?
[negative]	[02:17]	<ytsestef>	delire: i have the restricted package installed :(
[negative]	[02:17]	<ubunt1>	nvidia for UBuntu or Linux they make it like windows,now you can see the temp of the video,agp how you can put and something more.;
[positive]	[02:17]	<velko>	jonah, start from a live cd, edit /etc/passwd and change the user id and the group id for your new user to 1000 (default for your first user)
[neutral]	[02:17]	<delire>	beerockxs: does it have two VGA outs?
[neutral]	[02:17]	<beerockxs>	delire: I'm using the Mode2, HSync2, VSync2 and Pairmodes options of fglrx
[neutral]	[02:18]	<delire>	ytsestef: right
[negative]	[02:18]	<xukun_>	when I boot from de feisty cd so I can install I get green/yellow screen en then it freezes, any suggestions please?
[negative]	[02:18]	<ataylor>	"hi. I just upgraded to 7.04, and my hard drives are a bit messed up... my ntfs partition (hda1) can no longer be mounted using ""sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/hda1"" and I keep on getting the error ""[mntent] : warning: no final newline at the end of /etc/fstab"""
[negative]	[02:18]	<LjL>	"pjesi: i went into debian/, edited changelog.in, and put 0.9.3 instead of @versionwhatever@, and saved it as changelog. (without the .in). then did the same with files.in.  then, *out* of the coral directory (i.e. in the parent), i did ""dpkg-source -b coral-0.9.3"""
[neutral]	[02:18]	<beerockxs>	it's dual dvi, and the CRT is connected via a dvi-vga adapter
[negative]	[02:18]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: what am i looking for in nvidia-settings? nothing looks out of the ordinary
[negative]	[02:18]	<RandomizeR>	everything looks like it's supposed to work, but it doesn't
[positive]	[02:18]	<LjL>	pjesi: i somehow suspect that editing those files manually wasn't what they had in mind, but i don't know what tool is supposed to be used :)
[positive]	[02:18]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: I don't think we're looking at the same client.. this small one only has three tabs, Download, Upload and Events
[negative]	[02:18]	<delire>	beerockxs: ahah, i've experienced problems with this on a projector once.
[negative]	[02:18]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: open terminal and write nvidia-settings
[negative]	[02:18]	<delire>	beerockxs: paste your xorg.conf
[neutral]	[02:18]	<ytsestef>	chowmeined: workarounds for what?
[negative]	[02:18]	<Dave123>	our install fest will be fun today....  we burned 30 copies of ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04 was just released and the servers are getting hit hard
[positive]	[02:18]	<SoftIce>	hello? nobody use vservers, what is the story with vserver + ubuntu feisty?
[neutral]	[02:18]	<Saelynh>	bonjour
[positive]	[02:19]	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: not having to wait 3 minutes for every lvm partition i make
[neutral]	[02:19]	<ubunt1>	chowmeined: try gparted
[negative]	[02:19]	<RandomizeR>	yeah, that works, and i get the nvidia settings dialog, and i checked all the options, nothing out of the ordinary
[positive]	[02:19]	<ytsestef>	chowmeined: the release notes suggest that you just wait and everthing will be alright ;)
[neutral]	[02:19]	<beerockxs>	delire: @HLINK
[negative]	[02:19]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, sorry, I see that now. Must be new in Feisty, I never saw it in Edgy.  Yeah, I don't see any config options there... probably a line command thing.
[negative]	[02:19]	<ajehuk>	ataylor - the error about the final newline is fairly self explanitory - just add a new line to the bottom of /etc/fstab.  your first issue we can resolve too - if you could post the output of 'sudo fstab -l'  and thecontents of /etc/fstab into a pastebin
[neutral]	[02:19]	<delire>	ytsestef: i don't know what to suggest. can you try to play an mp3 on the commandline with 'play file.mp3'?
[negative]	[02:19]	<chowmeined>	ubunt1: there is no gparted in text mode installer
[negative]	[02:19]	<jonah>	velko, am i ok doing that from DSL?
[neutral]	[02:19]	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: yes but.. im impatient...
[neutral]	[02:19]	<ubunt1>	chowmeined try gui mode
[negative]	[02:20]	<beerockxs>	delire: the 2nd head device is just there to get rid of a warning, it doesn't actually do anything
[neutral]	[02:20]	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: and i generally make 8-10 partitions
[neutral]	[02:20]	<barravince>	hi how i can upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04?
[negative]	[02:20]	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: oh well..
[negative]	[02:20]	<[Jonne] >	i want to upgrade to feisty, but the button to upgrade to feisty is gone in upgrade-manager. How do i get it back?
[negative]	[02:20]	<pjesi>	LjL: ok I will try
[positive]	[02:20]	<chowmeined>	ubunt1: gui mode doesnt support lvm
[negative]	[02:20]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: hehe yeah that's what I was thinking as well.. thanks anyways tho ; )
[negative]	[02:20]	<velko>	jonah, yes. every live cd will do it. the point is to get write access to /etc/passwd
[neutral]	[02:20]	<cherva>	LjL: no luck
[negative]	[02:20]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, so I'd have to recommend using a new client.  There's qTorrent (which I don't use), BitTornado (which was the Edgy default) and kTorrent (which I use even though It requires using the KDE libraries).
[neutral]	[02:20]	<ytsestef>	chowmeined: heh, guess you have to be patient for once!
[negative]	[02:20]	<JoeUK>	I'm having problems getting desktop effects working. I'm using Feisty and an ATI graphics card. Desktop fx hasnt worked since i enabled restricted drivers.
[negative]	[02:20]	<chowmeined>	ytsestef: guess so
[negative]	[02:20]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: in what version of UBuntu are you
[negative]	[02:20]	<jonah>	velko, thanks i'll give it a go
[positive]	[02:20]	<RandomizeR>	feisty, clean install
[negative]	[02:20]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: someone should port over uTorrent : )
[negative]	[02:21]	<ubunt1>	chowmeined: then that is bad.
[positive]	[02:21]	<thirdalbum>	I have a question: There's a script that I want to add to my startup sequence on Edgy, so it will run before Xorg attempts to start. How might I do this? Thanks in advance if anyone knows :-)
[negative]	[02:21]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, yes they should.  ktorrent is the closest, which is why I use it.
[negative]	[02:21]	<chowmeined>	ubunt1: what is bad?
[negative]	[02:21]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: it worked out of the box, but when i tried installing the nvidia drivers to get hardware acceleration, this happened
[neutral]	[02:21]	<Kohlgarten>	hello everybody. Is is possible to use network-manager with feisty and a RaLink 2500 wireless card?
[negative]	[02:21]	<ytsestef>	delire: this is unfortunately an amarok related problem, mp3 and flac are playing without a hitch in any other app
[negative]	[02:21]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: and the same problem was there on edgy, but i thought it was messed up that's why i did a clean install
[neutral]	[02:21]	<cherva>	LjL: same GLX error
[neutral]	[02:21]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: hmmm,go to systems then administration and restricted drivers manager
[negative]	[02:21]	<scanf>	so, can I use a 'unitialized' symbol from another module to resolve the driDispatchRemapTable symbol in /usr/X11R6/lib/libOSMesa.so.4?
[positive]	[02:21]	<trol0s>	Huffalump: I saw it was meant for the KDE desktop.. is it much work installing those libraries? worth it for just kTorrent?
[negative]	[02:22]	<LjL>	cherva: what was the error there precisely?
[negative]	[02:22]	<ubunt1>	chowmeined: that it don't supprt gui
[neutral]	[02:22]	<delire>	beerockxs: are you sure that the second monitor does 1152x864? also you might want to look into the Dont Zoom option.
[negative]	[02:22]	<JoeUK>	RandomizeR: what problem are you having?
[negative]	[02:22]	<delire>	ytsestef: right. perhaps there's an amarok channel?
[neutral]	[02:22]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: it has one entry, NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver
[positive]	[02:22]	<cherva>	LjL not shure whait i'll make it again :)
[negative]	[02:22]	<beerockxs>	delire: as I said, the setup is working fine at the correct resolutions in gnome, only in gdm is it messed up
[negative]	[02:22]	<ytsestef>	yep, there is. a channel that no-one answers , hahaah
[neutral]	[02:23]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: and is it enabled
[negative]	[02:23]	<ytsestef>	delire: that's a pity because i tried kubuntu and amarok is working great. the thing is i dont like kubuntu (or KDE in general)
[negative]	[02:23]	<LjL>	pjesi, i hate to do this but
[negative]	[02:23]	<RandomizeR>	JoeUK: nvidia driver doesn't work.. GeForece 5200, feisty; @HLINK <- xorg.0.log
[neutral]	[02:23]	<LjL>	!alien > pjesi    (pjesi, see the private message from Ubotu)
[negative]	[02:23]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: yep, enabled
[negative]	[02:23]	<JoeUK>	ah. im having problems with ATI drivers
[positive]	[02:23]	<JoeUK>	its not letting me do desktop effects
[negative]	[02:24]	<Patric2>	hey guys I have fresh installed feisty last night and I now have a few issues I would like to fix, when I log out my screen hangs? it just stays blank I then have to hold down the power button to turn the laptop off?? I hate that
[negative]	[02:24]	<InFlux>	Hi guys, I need a bit of help, I install Windows Vista first, and then 7.04. Grub did not install correctly. I have edited the menu.lst and got Windows to load OK. However, when I try to load Linux it gives error 22. The question is how to I know which drive and partition 7.04 installed itself on?
[neutral]	[02:24]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: and glxinfo says direct rendering is enabled too
[negative]	[02:24]	<pjesi>	LjL: I tried alien before I joined the channel
[negative]	[02:24]	<xukun_>	I cant seem to install feisty, I get green/yellow screen at the last stage when it should start X. I have nvidia 5200 card with dual video and all this while using the boot cd
[negative]	[02:24]	<ytsestef>	JoeUK: do you have the opensource drivers installed or the proprietary ones?
[neutral]	[02:24]	<RandomizeR>	"ubunt1: and restricted driver is enabled and status ""in use"""
[neutral]	[02:24]	<JoeUK>	proprietary i belive
[neutral]	[02:24]	<JoeUK>	the ones from restricted drivers
[negative]	[02:24]	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: ok, it seems that one of /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.*inst is calling update-fonts-dir incorrectly right?  I can't find the line that tries to use it incorrectly
[negative]	[02:25]	<ytsestef>	JoeUK: these drivers do not work with AIGLX, you have to either install XGL, or the opensource drivers
[neutral]	[02:25]	<InFlux>	Vista is installed on (hd0,0)
[negative]	[02:25]	<JoeUK>	how do i install the opensource drivers?
[negative]	[02:25]	<RandomizeR>	ubunt1: if u look at the end of the xorg log file (@HLINK u'll see the line saying that it encountered too many errors
[negative]	[02:25]	<delire>	beerockxs: ahah yikes, i didn't read that distinction. i have no idea why gdm is doing this. are there some gdm session files that contain screen geometry state that could be cleaned out.
[negative]	[02:25]	<RandomizeR>	(WW) NVIDIA(0): The NVIDIA X driver has encountered too many errors.  Falling
[neutral]	[02:26]	<RandomizeR>	(WW) NVIDIA(0):     back to legacy PCI mode.
[positive]	[02:26]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: i see it
[negative]	[02:26]	<velko>	InFlux, instead of guessing look this information up using something like partition magic or the ubuntu partitioning tool
[negative]	[02:26]	<ytsestef>	joeUK: they're copied when you install ubuntu, which means you just have to switch to them, by tweaking /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[positive]	[02:26]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: but it encouter 8 agp
[positive]	[02:26]	<kbrooks>	velko, there is a good alt to part magic
[neutral]	[02:26]	<ubunt1>	RandomizeR: moment.
[negative]	[02:26]	<mwe>	RandomizeR: paste xorg.conf
[negative]	[02:26]	<delire>	ytsestef: i don't use amarok so can't help there sorry. good luck. it sounds to me like amarok expects a kde related sound service to exist that doesn't, or is being overridden by another..
[negative]	[02:26]	<RandomizeR>	mwe: ok
[negative]	[02:26]	<sivaji_2009>	jrib : u r correct it is /var/lib/dpkg/info/xfonts-scalable.postinst just now i removed this corrupted file now  dpkg is alright thank you
[negative]	[02:27]	<Patric2>	hey guys I have fresh installed feisty last night and I now have a few issues I would like to fix, when I log out my screen hangs? it just stays blank I then have to hold down the power button to turn the laptop off?? I hate that...
[positive]	[02:27]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, unless your system is ancient, yes its worth it (I end up using a few other K-apps too, but ktorrent was the first and well worth it)
[neutral]	[02:27]	<kbrooks>	velko, gnome partition editor - aka gparted
[neutral]	[02:27]	<kbrooks>	!gparted
[negative]	[02:27]	<JoeUK>	ytsestef: could you guide me through it? pvt so not to flood?
[positive]	[02:27]	<ubotu>	"GParted is is a !GUI partitioning program. Type  sudo apt-get install gparted  in a console to install it - A GParted ""live"" CD is available at @HLINK"

[negative]	[02:27]	<ajehuk>	InFlux - when you edited your menu.lst to get windows working I assume you did it with a live CD, if so can you use the live CD again, grab the output of fdisk -l and the content of menu.list and paste bin them? - also it would bee good if you could mount your / or /boot filesystems and add the output of /s (of /boot) to that pastebin...

[neutral]	[02:27]	<velko>	kbrooks, thank you. could you point InFlux in this direction please?
[negative]	[02:27]	<pjesi>	LjL: did it build a .deb in your case? I just have a .dsc and an tar.gz archive

[neutral]	[02:27]	<RandomizeR>	oops, sry
[negative]	[02:27]	<LjL>	pjesi: no, it did the same. building a .deb involves more steps, i'm trying, but honestly i'm mostly going by trial and failure (and half-following !packaging)
[negative]	[02:28]	<InFlux>	velko, will gparted tell me what partition 7.04 is on? I can mount the the partition off the live CD, but I looked everywhere and I can find the parition info. like ie: hd2,4
[negative]	[02:28]	<jrib>	sivaji_2009: wait, but that file probably needs to do something to correctly configure the package
[negative]	[02:28]	<Huffalump>	trol0s - after ktorrent, the psychological barrier was broken.  frankly the KDE libs aren't resource heavy, so.... I ended up with some little games and other misc. rift raft.

I want to install Feisty from the CD but am nervous that when the installer asks for a user's details and passwords, if i enter the username i have on my edgy system that it'll overwrite my home directory - can anyone advise me if this will/won't happen?
[negative]	[02:29]	<cherva>	LjL: I tryed even without it no luck
[neutral]	[02:29]	<mwe>	bderwent: is the ubuntu partition mounted and mounted read/write?
[negative]	[02:29]	<McScruff>	i want to try mandriva with mettise on kde, do i need the full 4gb dvd or can i just get the kde cdrom?
[positive]	[02:29]	<Steil>	my cpu isn't really under any load....but its stuck at its highest clock speed (I have an AMD Athlon XP-M) under edgy it would only goto the highest clock speed under load and otherwise it'd be at half speed
[negative]	[02:29]	<Steil>	any ideas?
[negative]	[02:30]	<Huffalump>	trol0s, yuck.  I've had that on Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows.  uTorrent taught me to avoid Azureus whenever possible.
[negative]	[02:30]	<linoleum>	I would like to know : is there a fixed package of nvidia-glx-new to work withe the 8800GTX now, or do we still need to do the wfb.so symlink workaround ?

[negative]	[02:30]	<mwe>	bderwent: I have to go for a few minutes but chroot is the keyword. I'll help you when I get back ...
[neutral]	[02:30]	<LjL>	cherva: anyway the key there is dlopen: /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1: undefined symbol: _nv000043gl

[negative]	[02:31]	<ytsestef>	"JoeUK: unfortunately I am no linux expert... sorry. the only thing i can tell you is open the xorg.conf file as root (sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf) and go to the device section and change the line ""driver"" from ""fglrx"" to ""ati"", then save the file and restart X by pressing control+alt+backspace. when you login again you have the opensource drivers running, which should enable you to use aiglx"
[negative]	[02:31]	<LjL>	cherva: no - well unsurprisingly, the package containing that file is nvidia-glx

[negative]	[02:31]	<broyles>	i know this going to sound like a stupid question, but how do i get firefox to use the backspace key to go back a page..., it usually does that but in ubuntu it seems to just go up the page?
[negative]	[02:31]	<JoeUK>	ok ty
[negative]	[02:31]	<sivaji_2009>	jrib may i know what is the need of that file

[negative]	[02:31]	<mwe>	bderwent: where is your ubuntu hdd partition mounted?
[negative]	[02:31]	<Huffalump>	trol0s - bet you a nickel that Azureus takes at least twice or more resource than ktorrent.  Probably 5 x.

[negative]	[02:33]	<rellik>	ubunt1, yeah.  in VLC they play fine..  I am thinking maybe it's because there is a problem when two programs try to play sound at the same time (and vlc releases the sound card between songs, but amarok doesn't I guess)
[negative]	[02:33]	<Huffalump>	"clever, I found ktorrent is very utorrent-like.  Low resource and very familiar.  The only thing was to get over the psychological barrier of ""oh noez!! kde libs!"""

[negative]	[02:41]	<BeBraw>	psycop: i have the same problem here
[negative]	[02:41]	<bderwent>	mwe: figured it out, whatever 'mount -o bind /proc /media/disk/proc' was I just did it
[negative]	[02:41]	<ubunt1>	Huffalump: in version 6.10 it work,but thanks i will see what is the problem.
[negative]	[02:41]	<rnd_>	I do not know - it installed packages and then nothing =- just that test desktop
[negative]	[02:41]	<velko>	jonah, you have to change the ownership of all the files and directories in your /home directory so they belong to the user with uid 1000
[neutral]	[02:41]	<Jestre>	psycop: SATA drive?
[neutral]	[02:41]	<ubunt1>	rellik: no problem.

[positive]	[02:41]	<spikeb>	niekko, you're most welcome :)
[negative]	[02:41]	<velko>	jonah, let me explain it so that you know what happened and how to deal with the problem
[neutral]	[02:42]	<mwe>	bderwent: chroot /media/disk /bin/bash. then source /etc/profile
[positive]	[02:42]	<jonah>	velko, thanks

[negative]	[02:42]	<velko>	jonah, the file system recognizes the objects (files, directories) by numbers, which are mapped to user names
[negative]	[02:42]	<ytsestef>	had anyone any luck with getting video handled by aiglx? (that involves wobbling and opacity effects in the video window and being viewable in the cube). It has something to do with opengl output plugins. but when i enable the opengl output plugin. the player application terminates.

[positive]	[02:47]	<mwe>	hansen: not if it's just sitting there

[negative]	[02:55]	<askar>	ferret: after i made something stupid with restricted manager I no longer have direct rendering..can you help me?
[neutral]	[02:55]	<psycop>	"I keep getting ""Buffer I/O error on device sr0, logical block #####"" Anyone know why?"
[negative]	[02:56]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, ok I will take a look
[negative]	[02:56]	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: i guess so. other distros using the same kernel do that boot hang? or is it an ubuntu exclusive feature?
[positive]	[02:56]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ ideally, you would post that to a pastebin somewhere and then get help to solve whatever is the problem in your specific case.  However, I realize that may be difficult to do from the prompt ;)
[neutral]	[02:56]	<ferret>	askar: Uhh, probably not.  But if you upload your X log and configuration to a pastebin someone should be able to help

[negative]	[02:56]	<Hor|zon>	ytsestef: is there a reason you couldn't just run 32-bit firefox in 64-bit ubuntu and watch youtube that way?
[negative]	[02:56]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ so, instead, see if you can find toward the end... where the problem was and what it was
[negative]	[02:56]	<KnightGeek>	I could try knoppix

[positive]	[02:58]	<jonah>	velko, that gives me drwxr-xr-x  8  1000  1000
[positive]	[02:58]	<MrWhammy>	jrib: not yet, no, will do so now :)
[positive]	[02:58]	<ytsestef>	KnightGeek: you can try switching to verbose mode during boot and see what makes it hang (i dont know the shortcut or the commandline option though)
[neutral]	[02:58]	<Hor|zon>	ytsestef: lol it's easy...there's even scripts to do it for you on the forums...and install flash 9 and java for it
[negative]	[02:58]	<LjL>	pjesi: alright, i've somehow (how? no idea) managed to convince dpkg-buildpackage to actually try compiling the thing, but the errors are the same.

[negative]	[03:42]	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: don't expect people here to be familiar with windows apps. not everyone has used windows berfore using linux.
[negative]	[03:42]	<Bundaluk>	Then half way through the process my internet connection dropped out...
[negative]	[03:42]	<kisho1>	Hey thanks let me try though I tried earlier with xorg tweaking .. albeit all failure
[neutral]	[03:42]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - did you plug it in different places or just reboot?
[positive]	[03:42]	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: have you tried booting the older kernel from the grub menu yet?
[neutral]	[03:43]	<askar>	compwiz18: atheros hardware access layer
[negative]	[03:43]	<Rprp`>	POVaddct: Hmm, oke... but is there any 'Linux Broadcaster'?
[positive]	[03:43]	<Bundaluk>	And the manager reverted all of the feisty files back to edgy...
[neutral]	[03:43]	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg i just did a reboot
[negative]	[03:43]	<ceil420>	/usr/local/bin/ut: 29: Syntax error: Bad substitution
[neutral]	[03:43]	<Wesselaar>	it chnages at every boot
[neutral]	[03:43]	<kisho1>	rgrep uboto
[negative]	[03:43]	<ceil420>	how can i make that a good substitution? :x
[neutral]	[03:43]	<xtknight>	ceil420, are you using the right shell (bash vs sh)?
[negative]	[03:43]	<chrissi>	Huffalump: Oh I don't have any connection-problems - the upgrade manager doesn't show any upgrade button (which was shown before I updated edgy with security fixes)
[neutral]	[03:43]	<unimatrix9>	Rprp , icecast?
[neutral]	[03:43]	<Bundaluk>	Now when I try to use Update Manager it doesn't give an option to upgrade to Feisty.
[neutral]	[03:43]	<ceil420>	i dno :o
[negative]	[03:43]	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: i don't know what you mean by broadcaster? something like icecast maybe?
[negative]	[03:43]	<unimatrix9>	Rprp : or maybe VLC
[neutral]	[03:43]	<xtknight>	ceil420, try sh /usr/local/bin/ut
[negative]	[03:43]	<compwiz18>	askar: I'm starting to get lost...you have an Intel card right?
[neutral]	[03:43]	<ceil420>	i'm using alt+f2 > enter
[negative]	[03:43]	<aricz_>	How do I open ports in Ubuntu?
[positive]	[03:43]	<Bundaluk>	It worked beautifully on my desktop computer
[positive]	[03:43]	<davidosa>	Anyone familiar with installing RealPlayer 10.5?
[negative]	[03:43]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar, how odd, i have a USB headset and mine doesn't do that, any custom drivers or anything?
[neutral]	[03:43]	<xtknight>	aricz_, ubuntu has all ports open by default
[neutral]	[03:43]	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: did you see my post?
[negative]	[03:43]	<b_e_n_z>	i tried getting netbeans 5.5 and in the middle of the apt-get, it says i have to download *.tgz from sun.com... what's going on?  i thought java se 6 + glassfish app server + netbeans should be available in the repository
[positive]	[03:44]	<Huffalump>	Bundaluk, again, have you considered upgrading from CD?  Or what ctothej recommended?
[negative]	[03:44]	<askar>	compwiz18: yes.. there was a command I could check that but dont remember?
[positive]	[03:44]	<ceil420>	if it works, thanks (cos i'll be in a game); if not, i'll ask again but thanks for trying :p
[negative]	[03:44]	<xtknight>	Bloe, their documentation is poor

[negative]	[03:44]	<duelboot>	"compwiz18, see the link here...I can now ""see"" and apparently connect, but nothing more... any help?  @HLINK"
[negative]	[03:44]	<Bundaluk>	ctothej: no other options on grub at startup
[neutral]	[03:44]	<aricz_>	Deluge Bittorent tells me I may be behind a firewall, no open ports..
[negative]	[03:44]	<xtknight>	Bloe, i think they want you to use the install.sh but im not sure.  let's see
[positive]	[03:44]	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, i use the normal ubuntu drivers, they work but i need to change the soundsystem all the time, my default soundcard is my usb mic now :-)
[negative]	[03:44]	<Bloe>	xtkngiht: Ok, so you don't know the answer either?
[negative]	[03:44]	<ctothej>	hmm
[positive]	[03:44]	<xtknight>	Bloe, no im not giving up that easily ;)

[negative]	[03:45]	<xtknight>	Bloe, i just did ./configure, then Makefile appeared
[neutral]	[03:45]	<pspawn>	Hi, guys. My mic stopped working when I updated to Feisty yesterday. Can anyone help me?
[negative]	[03:45]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - yeah i do the same thing i have a logitech USB-based headset/mic
[neutral]	[03:45]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, hold one...my default route is set for eth0...give me a sec
[neutral]	[03:45]	<Huffalump>	pspawn, have you checked your alsamixer ?
[negative]	[03:45]	<xtknight>	Bloe, i guess i was confusing install.sh and autogen.sh so revoke my comment about poor docs..it works fine here
[positive]	[03:45]	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: go with the feisty live cd.
[positive]	[03:45]	<petriborg>	but mine always shows up as hw1,0
[negative]	[03:45]	<Bloe>	xtknight: Strange, it didn't appeared on my PC.
[neutral]	[03:45]	<xtknight>	"Bloe, pastebin the log of ""./configure"""

[negative]	[03:46]	<vox754>	aricz_, you usually open them in the router, not in the Operating system itself
[positive]	[03:46]	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg , it has been 0,0 1,0 and 2,0 today here
[negative]	[03:46]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ Were you able to verify that driver setting?  Or where are we now?
[positive]	[03:46]	<browns>	how do i make microsoft XP my deafult boot?
[negative]	[03:46]	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, sorry.  you'll have to highlight your messages with my name in front or i'll miss them easily
[negative]	[03:46]	<vega__>	can i use ubuntu as nas server
[negative]	[03:46]	<Huffalump>	browns, edit your grub menu list and put windows on top of the list
[negative]	[03:46]	<pspawn>	Huffalump: There's a sound coming, but i sounds like static and nothing more.
[negative]	[03:46]	<compwiz18>	askar: try opening a terminal and modprobe i810, then restart x
[negative]	[03:46]	<aricz_>	vox754, strange, I had no problems with it in winxp
[negative]	[03:46]	<Bundaluk>	ctclothej: How do I upgrade using the CD rather than doing a fresh install.. I dont want to need to back up all the data on my hard drive and then reinstall it.
[neutral]	[03:46]	<Wesselaar>	never had that with opensuse , but i dont like suse
[neutral]	[03:46]	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, what happened after your network dropped?
[neutral]	[03:46]	<compwiz18>	askar: use << sudo modprobe i810 >>
[positive]	[03:46]	<unimatrix9>	vega : freenas is very easy to setup , google for it...
[neutral]	[03:46]	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, are you on edgy now?  feisty?  frankenstein?
[neutral]	[03:46]	<nraic>	xtknight, I installed cpuburn in from package manager, I cant find it in the application, who do I run the program?
[neutral]	[03:46]	<compwiz18>	askar: use sudo modprobe i810
[positive]	[03:46]	<vega__>	thanks
[negative]	[03:46]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, sorry I lost the connection so I missed everything you said before. yes I pasted the whole thing at: @HLINK please take a look
[neutral]	[03:46]	<mtron_x86>	anyone experienced with kaffeine here?
[neutral]	[03:46]	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: the upgrade cd should detect your installation and keep the data.
[neutral]	[03:46]	<xtknight>	"nraic, type ""dpkg -L cpuburn"", that may give you a cule"
[neutral]	[03:47]	<xtknight>	clue*
[neutral]	[03:47]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar do you have a custom .asoundrc file?
[negative]	[03:47]	<ctothej>	Bundaluk: you shouldnt have to reformat at all
[negative]	[03:47]	<askar>	compwiz18: ok ill try.. should I choose to use i180 in the xorg file again?
[negative]	[03:47]	<compwiz18>	yeah
[negative]	[03:47]	<compwiz18>	askar: yeah
[positive]	[03:47]	<Bundaluk>	xtknight: when the line dropped out it very cleverly and automatically reverted all files back to edgy
[negative]	[03:47]	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, ok what happens if you run update-manager again?
[negative]	[03:47]	<nraic>	xtknight, yeh give me lots of dir, which one would be the binary i need to run?
[negative]	[03:47]	<davidosa>	How do i install the RealPlayer .bin file
[negative]	[03:47]	<browns>	Huffalump, whats the grub menu and how do i get into it?
[negative]	[03:48]	<xtknight>	nraic, look for files that have no extension.  these are usually binaries
[negative]	[03:48]	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, no i havent , would that solve the problem ?
[negative]	[03:48]	<askar>	compwiz18: should I install xserver-xorg-video-i810 again too? :o
[neutral]	[03:48]	<compwiz18>	askar: yes
[negative]	[03:48]	<Huffalump>	"xukun_ I see it on line 86, where it says ""nv"" and that would have been my workaround.  So, I wont be able to help you further, unfortunately.  Sorry to disappoint."
[negative]	[03:48]	<xtknight>	nraic, ok see where it says /usr/bin/*
[neutral]	[03:48]	<vox754>	!grub > browns
[neutral]	[03:48]	<velko>	jonah, are you still fighting?
[neutral]	[03:48]	<ytsestef>	how do I change my monitors refresh rate from 60 Hz to 75? I edited my xorg.conf but still only 60Hz is available..
[neutral]	[03:48]	<Bundaluk>	"xtknight: it doesn't give the ""upgrade to feisty"" button up the top. No matter how often I refresh."
[negative]	[03:49]	<xtknight>	nraic, everything under /usr/bin/ is a binary.  it installed six programs.  it looks like each one is optimized for a specific architecture
[negative]	[03:49]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, I understand thanks for trying anyways
[negative]	[03:49]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - i don't know for sure or anything, mine didn't work at all until i wrote a custom rc file, that might be a 6.10 issue though
[negative]	[03:49]	<nraic>	xtknight, ok il try run one of them
[negative]	[03:49]	<petriborg>	ytsestef - did you use a custom mode line to do it?
[negative]	[03:49]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ one last thing, what happens if you run startx at this point?
[negative]	[03:49]	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, interesting.  dont you have to throw parameters to update-manager, though  like -c or -d?
[negative]	[03:49]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, no joy...I get the icon indicating connection, but no bars and my network is unreachable...any ideas?
[positive]	[03:50]	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, the custom asoundrc links a programm to the correct hw number , but the hw number changes everytime here :-)
[negative]	[03:50]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, no joy...I get the icon indicating connection, but no bars and my network is unreachable...any ideas?
[negative]	[03:50]	<ytsestef>	petriborg: what do you mean? i edited the file in nano
[negative]	[03:50]	<compwiz18>	duelboot: what program are you using the manage the connection?
[negative]	[03:50]	<chrissi>	Bundaluk: did you try to update to feisty before?
[neutral]	[03:50]	<Woody_>	/server #undernet
[neutral]	[03:50]	<ytsestef>	petriborg: although i think you are not talking about this... hehe
[neutral]	[03:50]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, I try that
[negative]	[03:50]	<browns>	"vox754,	!grub > browns huh, little more info?"
[negative]	[03:50]	<atomiku>	I'm currently using openbox, What panel should I use?
[negative]	[03:50]	<Bundaluk>	xtknight I'll give ait a quick try
[negative]	[03:50]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ What kind of ugliness?
[negative]	[03:51]	<atomiku>	Tried xfce4-panel and gnome-panel, they both sorta suck
[negative]	[03:51]	<jonah>	velko, yeah just booting up xubuntu again to try it - man this sucks, all i did was add another user in...
[neutral]	[03:51]	<xtknight>	"Bundaluk, like ""gksu update-manager -c -d"""
[negative]	[03:51]	<petriborg>	"ytsestef - i did ModeLine    ""1600x1200_59.92_rb"" 130.25 1600 1648 1680 1760 1200 1203 12    07 1235 +hsync -vsync"
[negative]	[03:51]	<duelboot>	the default...and I've tried the command line as well
[neutral]	[03:51]	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: no -d
[negative]	[03:51]	<chrissi>	I only installed security fixes to edgy and NO update option
[neutral]	[03:51]	<xtknight>	gnomefreak, no?  i've seen it before
[neutral]	[03:51]	<vox754>	!grub | browns you probably missed it
[positive]	[03:51]	<ubotu>	browns you probably missed it: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: @HLINK - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:51]	<Huffalump>	browns, sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[negative]	[03:51]	<xtknight>	gnomefreak, ah it's for devel releases
[neutral]	[03:51]	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: -d == development release
[negative]	[03:51]	<odium>	I want to tackle my sound trouble today, where should I begin? I have a ensonic audio pci sound card?!
[positive]	[03:51]	<velko>	jonah, yeah in ubuntu only the first user you create have the admin privileges ;-)
[negative]	[03:51]	<petriborg>	ytsestef - that changed mine from like 76 to 74.99 or something
[positive]	[03:51]	<Huffalump>	browns, use cut/paste to move windows to the top of the list
[negative]	[03:51]	<xtknight>	"Bundaluk, just ""gksu update-manager -c"" actually but -d wouldnt have done anything"
[neutral]	[03:52]	<kel>	Hi.
[negative]	[03:52]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - its really odd i'm not sure what to do sorry :(
[negative]	[03:52]	<xtknight>	do they have any repositories setup for gutsy yet?
[negative]	[03:52]	<ytsestef>	petriborg: i don't how to use ModeLine parameters. i edited the  monitor properties instead
[negative]	[03:52]	<pjesi>	LjL: I perhaps should have mentioned that I use Kubuntu
[neutral]	[03:52]	<xtknight>	"or any ""infrastructure"" if you will"
[positive]	[03:52]	<Bundaluk>	chrissi I've successfully updated on my desktop... Internet connection kept it together long enough :) Just Laptop with the problem!
[negative]	[03:52]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, but i have to kill it first because X is already running but with that green/yellow screen
[neutral]	[03:52]	<Buggie>	yay, flash player is working, thanks compwiz18!
[neutral]	[03:52]	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: toolchain might be ill be checking later
[neutral]	[03:52]	<Wesselaar>	Petriborg, no problem , tnx for reacting anyway
[negative]	[03:52]	<Zeka-Rodzer>	hi 2 all
[negative]	[03:52]	<xtknight>	gnomefreak, ah what is toolchain?
[negative]	[03:52]	<odium>	What steps should I take to trouble shoot my audio troubles?!
[neutral]	[03:52]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ but its not running under root is it?
[negative]	[03:52]	<Bundaluk>	xtknight: I'll try it out in a minute and let you know how I go..
[negative]	[03:52]	<xtknight>	Bundaluk, okay
[positive]	[03:52]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, the default network manager
[negative]	[03:52]	<petriborg>	Wesselaar - i assume you checked google
[negative]	[03:53]	<ytsestef>	petriborg: can you give me a link or sth on how to use ModeLine?
[neutral]	[03:53]	<odium>	I'm using an old compy with a Audio PCI card from Ensonic.
[neutral]	[03:53]	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: gcc and freinds
[negative]	[03:53]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, but the problem appears to be with my card...
[negative]	[03:53]	<chrissi>	Bundaluk: That's interesting. Same problem here, but I didn't even tried to update to feisty
[negative]	[03:53]	<gnomefreak>	xtknight: the base so you can build packages
[negative]	[03:53]	<compwiz18>	duelboot: good luck with it, it doesn't like bcm43xx all the time
[negative]	[03:53]	<compwiz18>	duelboot: what does iwlist scan give you?
[negative]	[03:53]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, no it just started with the live cd
[neutral]	[03:53]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, the list of WAPs
[negative]	[03:53]	<LjL>	"pjesi: i use kubuntu too... it's frustrating, i had got it to a point where it didn't give the python errors anymore - just complained that Python.h was missing in a c++ file, solved by exporting an appropriate INCLUDE variable... - but then it complained that ""swig"" should have been used in ""classic"" mode. in order to do that, i had to remake the whole thing, and i deleted the directory"
[neutral]	[03:53]	<Bloe>	xtknight: I saw one error of the XML Parser:@HLINK
[neutral]	[03:53]	<petriborg>	ytsestef - i used a webpage i found to generate the number
[negative]	[03:53]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, and from there I when to console
[negative]	[03:53]	<odium>	someone give me a nudge in the right direction, please.
[negative]	[03:53]	<LjL>	pjesi: now i don't remember how the heck i get past those python errors, and my shell history doesn't help at all
[negative]	[03:54]	<compwiz18>	duelboot: are you trying to connect to an encrypted or not encrypted network?
[negative]	[03:54]	<ytsestef>	petriborg, oh, i see.. thanks!
[negative]	[03:54]	<pspawn>	anyone else had mic problems with feisty?
[negative]	[03:54]	<duelboot>	"compwiz18, I can scan and ""connect"" but get no signal after...it's unencrypted"
[negative]	[03:54]	<odium>	Audio PCI from ensonic, I've tried numerously with no avail.
[neutral]	[03:54]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ from the frozen X, try CTRL+ALT+Backspace
[positive]	[03:54]	<chrissi>	xtknight: c-Option helped
[positive]	[03:54]	<Tom47>	davidosa what happens when you enter each of those instructions?
[negative]	[03:54]	<compwiz18>	do you know how to use iwconfig, ifconfig, route, dhclient, etc?
[negative]	[03:54]	<pjesi>	LjL: but you got past them without actually modifying any code right?
[negative]	[03:55]	<compwiz18>	duelboot: do you know how to use iwconfig, ifconfig, route, dhclient, etc?
[negative]	[03:55]	<LjL>	pjesi: err, no, not exactly
[negative]	[03:55]	<pfk>	anyone having trouble with KVM?  I get a core dump when the vm starts.  It looks like it is related to real mode support of the intel VT extensions.
[negative]	[03:55]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, did that but it comes back the same problem
[negative]	[03:55]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, or anyone...what chipset should I get in my wireless card (yes, I know I will have to buy another)...yes I've tried all of that compwiz18
[neutral]	[03:55]	<petriborg>	ytsestef - @HLINK
[negative]	[03:55]	<petriborg>	ytsestef - i'm not sure if that is the right one but it looked sort of like that
[neutral]	[03:55]	<davidosa>	When i do, Terminal says no such directory exists
[negative]	[03:56]	<askar>	compwiz18: nope :(
[negative]	[03:56]	<Rprp`>	POVaddct: Yea, Something like ICecast, I did install shoutcast, But i want to manage the songs etc,..
[negative]	[03:56]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ that should kill X and dump you to a prompt
[negative]	[03:56]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, sad part is it worked immediately with my Vaio...it's the gateway giving me problems
[negative]	[03:56]	<petriborg>	ytsestef - googling for x11 modeline generator will probably find what you want
[negative]	[03:56]	<POVaddct>	Rprp`: sorry, i dont use such tools
[neutral]	[03:56]	<ytsestef>	petriborg: thanks, i googled modeline and i found another

[negative]	[03:58]	<compwiz18>	askar: good luck, sorry we couldn't fix it
[negative]	[03:58]	<duelboot>	compwiz18, maybe I need to change the interrupt?
[negative]	[03:58]	<xtknight>	chrissi, oh i see.  yeah that is by design.  it wont show unless you do -c

[neutral]	[03:59]	<CarlFK>	aeonix: it rocks.

[neutral]	[03:59]	<xtknight>	Bloe, libxml-parser-perl - Perl module for parsing XML files
[negative]	[03:59]	<chrissi>	xtknight: No the option was there until I installed edgy security fixes (like it's recommend before upgrading)
[neutral]	[03:59]	<hordur>	i upgraded to v6.10 and lost my internet connection (dhcp ethernet), can anyone plz help?
[neutral]	[03:59]	<xtknight>	Huffalump, -d is to upgrade to a development release.  i wouldnt use it
[negative]	[03:59]	<duelboot>	Can anyone tell me a wireless card or chipset I should use for success?

[positive]	[03:59]	<fuzzy_logic>	aeonix: i recommend you not to upgrade just yet.. i still have probs with upgrading.. it has nice features but not everything works well.. i think it needs some time so that people can write howto's etc. for it..

[neutral]	[04:00]	<xtknight>	all, wont the upgrade notice only appear if you initiate update-manager with -c from the command line??

[neutral]	[04:00]	<duelboot>	CarlFK, pcmcia
[negative]	[04:00]	<linoleum>	Flannel: is it possible to change the behaviour of add/remove, so it can shows me as many package as synaptic?
[neutral]	[04:00]	<Flannel>	!firewall | aricz_
[negative]	[04:00]	<xukun_>	Huffalump, no no luck it comes back with the same problem
[positive]	[04:00]	<ubotu>	aricz_: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see @HLINK or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[negative]	[04:00]	<chrissi>	xtknight: Now the problem appeared again... I closed update-manger, started it again (with c-Switch) and no update-button
[positive]	[04:00]	<czedlitz>	i have a folder on a HD in my user and group, but i need to change the group to users so that some of the other users on my system can access that folder, what is the command line i need to change that folders group to users but to keep me as owner of the files?
[negative]	[04:00]	<xtknight>	Flannel, ah?  the dist-upgrade appears in a normal periodic update-manager for edgy->Feisty?

[negative]	[04:01]	<Huffalump>	xukun_ so you killed the gdm, right?  and then what?  startx?  before you did the startx again, I wanted to verify the config for that particular user

[positive]	[04:01]	<xtknight>	chrissi, weird.  did you close it before pressing update the first time?
[neutral]	[04:01]	<raw>	xtknight: no

[negative]	[04:09]	<LjL>	pjesi: #swig is populated, and so i guess is #python, i'd venture to say they're the best bets if there's no coral channel
[positive]	[04:09]	<brent>	velko, ok :)
[negative]	[04:09]	<xtknight>	oh py stuff :\
[negative]	[04:10]	<delire>	jisatsu: what card is it? perhaps network-manager is getting in the way.
[negative]	[04:10]	<LjL>	xtknight: trying to compile @HLINK

[positive]	[04:10]	<oldude67>	ok it tells me it couldnt find the file and its on my desk top
[negative]	[04:10]	<tarelerulz>	Do any of you  get you yahoo or other online mail forward to you local program like thunderbird ?
[positive]	[04:10]	<brent>	velko, I have that book btw, you can just give me the page number (unless you want everyone else to know) :)

[negative]	[04:10]	<delire>	jisatsu: are you using a Realtek card?
[neutral]	[04:10]	<ubotu>	To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see @HLINK
[negative]	[04:10]	<sixth>	"hey, why do i get a """"The Composite extension is not available"" when i open Desktop Effects?"

[negative]	[04:10]	<LjL>	xtknight: he's on edgy, i'm on feisty, we get slightly different errors, but anyway i suspect it has to do with that program really warning python 2.3 rather than 2.4 (edgy) or 2.5 (feisty). at any rate, it won't compile
[negative]	[04:11]	<jisatsu>	delire: realtek chipset, yeah
[negative]	[04:11]	<gecko>	hey where can i get some help installing a dock in XGL on 7.04?
[positive]	[04:11]	<delire>	jisatsu: right, this is a known problem..
[negative]	[04:11]	<xtknight>	LjL, ah right from the start it's kinda intimidating..no configure in the root dir
[negative]	[04:11]	<askar>	epod:  hrm ok.. ill try
[negative]	[04:11]	<delire>	Horscht: unless they're using Feisty of course..
[neutral]	[04:11]	<velko>	brent, page 111 (3.1 What is GTK+?)
[neutral]	[04:11]	<magnetron>	sixth: Do you have the proper graphics drivers installed?
[neutral]	[04:11]	<unimatrix9>	sixth : becuase you have an nvidia card and the drivers are not installed?
[positive]	[04:11]	<brent>	velko, ahh thanks!
[neutral]	[04:11]	<laktek>	how to cancel a upgrade ?
[neutral]	[04:11]	<sixth>	unimatrix9: no
[negative]	[04:11]	<epod>	askar, also, are you getting an out of video memory error?
[negative]	[04:11]	<sixth>	magnetron: yes i did
[negative]	[04:11]	<Horscht>	delire: sorry?
[negative]	[04:11]	<delire>	jisatsu: try this: sudo apt-get remove network-manager --purge
[negative]	[04:11]	<LjL>	xtknight: yeah, quite intimidating, try make though, it'll complain about swig, if you install swig, it'll compile quite a few things, and then give python errors
[neutral]	[04:11]	<sixth>	i own an ATI radeon card
[negative]	[04:11]	<BeBraw>	sixth: it does not work with ati
[negative]	[04:12]	<spikeb>	sixth: im sorry
[negative]	[04:12]	<jisatsu>	delire: ok, one sec
[neutral]	[04:12]	<delire>	jisatsu: then just use the normal Gnome network-admin tool.
[negative]	[04:12]	<xtknight>	LjL, do you know the homepage of that package?
[neutral]	[04:12]	<xtknight>	the .tar.*
[negative]	[04:12]	<sixth>	BeBraw: what does then?
[neutral]	[04:12]	<JC_Denton_>	hello all, is there a mplayer plugin for opera?
[negative]	[04:12]	<delire>	jisatsu: you might want to restart..

[neutral]	[04:12]	<spikeb>	JC_Denton_: opera should be able to use the firefox plugin
[positive]	[04:12]	<LjL>	xtknight: there is a skeleton Debian directory, and if you grep, you'll find the Depends include python >= 2.3 -- greater than or equal, so it says, but
[neutral]	[04:12]	<LjL>	xtknight: @HLINK
[neutral]	[04:12]	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb, it doesnt...
[negative]	[04:12]	<brent>	so to sum it up for anyone interested, GTK got the 'plus' added on when it became object-oriented
[neutral]	[04:12]	<askar>	epod: noo... dont think so
[negative]	[04:12]	<delire>	Horscht: reccommending people on Feisty to use the binary driver howto is not necessary if they can just system->administration->restricted driver manager
[neutral]	[04:12]	<kbrooks>	brent, what?
[neutral]	[04:13]	<epod>	askar, k.
[negative]	[04:13]	<tarelerulz>	I think I have read of an plugin for mplayer for Opera
[positive]	[04:13]	<Horscht>	delire, i wanted info on the drivers :D
[negative]	[04:13]	<askar>	epod: should I now restart X or should I do something else first?
[positive]	[04:13]	<delire>	Horscht: ahah ;)
[positive]	[04:13]	<BeBraw>	sixth: there are open source drivers that work with certain ati cards well (google for ati and aiglx)
[positive]	[04:13]	<pjesi>	LjL: you have done more than enough! many thanks
[negative]	[04:13]	<epod>	askar, try restarting X, then run glxinfo | grep rendering when it's back up and let me know what it says

[negative]	[04:14]	<sixth>	"BeBraw: so you're pretty much saying my gfxcard driver isnt installed? by ""restricted drivers manager"" it says it is installed"

[neutral]	[04:18]	<epod>	askar, you said you installed an ati driver.  Which one?
[negative]	[04:18]	<LjL>	xtknight: yeah, g++ runs for a while
[negative]	[04:18]	<spikeb>	JC_Denton_: honestly, im not sure. if it doesn't you can remove the mplayer plugin to test.
[negative]	[04:18]	<xtknight>	yeah it failed
[negative]	[04:18]	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: how do u connect to the internet?

[neutral]	[04:19]	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: via direct ethernet cable directly to the wall socket. ipv4, dhcp
[negative]	[04:19]	<pjesi>	xtknight: yes in coral/makefile.swig, SWIGBIN = swig -classic
[negative]	[04:19]	<epod>	askar, yeah that'd be the one.  It broke your mesagl probably.
[positive]	[04:19]	<JC_Denton_>	spikeb.. k will do.. I hope it works for opera anyhow
[neutral]	[04:19]	<xtknight>	pjesi, ahh
[negative]	[04:19]	<askar>	epod: oh ok
[negative]	[04:19]	<mrcreativity>	delire: please help me, i dont understand, obviously im a noob

[neutral]	[04:20]	<ubotu>	sree: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[negative]	[04:20]	<XiXaQ>	There used to be problems with running more than 3 Xen guests in ubuntu. Has that been fixed?
[negative]	[04:20]	<elsni>	please: how can I get a higher screen resolution than 1600xsomething (i.e. 1920x1200) with closed source ATI driver?
[neutral]	[04:20]	<chrissi>	xtknight: The update-manager notices that there is a new release
[negative]	[04:20]	<sree>	ubontu - yeah I followed that
[negative]	[04:20]	<xtknight>	chrissi, yeah?
[negative]	[04:20]	<sree>	but i stopped on some 3rd party repos
[neutral]	[04:20]	<sixth>	magnetron: Xgl? are you sure? last time i used ubuntu (dapper) i used aiglx
[neutral]	[04:20]	<chrissi>	xtnight: and writes that in the file ~/.update-manager/meta-release
[negative]	[04:20]	<abdelrahman>	hi, i been looking for codecs to run my video files , i need MKV, AVI , OGG, any thing and every thing
[positive]	[04:20]	<nexact>	I think I found a bug, XDMCP by default listen on udp6 and not udp.. netstat -l | grep xdmcp --> udp6       0      0 *:xdmcp                 *:*.. is There a way to make sure that XDMCP is listening on UDPv4 and not UDPv6 ?
[neutral]	[04:20]	<sree>	then i removed them from repo list
[negative]	[04:21]	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: ok ... it might be that the network card has been assigned i different device (happend to me) ... but i have wireless and wired network cards (laptop)
[neutral]	[04:21]	<MistaED>	is there a problem with the current 96xx driver in ubuntu not working with geforce3's? my dad upgraded from edgy to feisty and now 3D acceleration doesn't work, however the driver starts up fine and the xorg log doesn't say anything wrong other than some fatal error and reverting to PCI mode
[negative]	[04:21]	<chrissi>	xtknight: If there is an entry for feisty already it thinks the update occured
[neutral]	[04:21]	<psycop>	guys
[negative]	[04:21]	<abdelrahman>	a good player would be helpful too
[neutral]	[04:21]	<MistaED>	however it works fine for everything else except for 3D acceleration
[negative]	[04:21]	<psycop>	how do i install 8800gts drivers?
[negative]	[04:21]	<xtknight>	chrissi, weird.  maybe you should submit a bug
[negative]	[04:21]	<ceil420>	/usr/local/bin/ut: 29: Syntax error: Bad substitution    <=- how do i make that a *good* substitution? :x
[negative]	[04:21]	<magnetron>	sixth: you did? AIGLX doesn't work with the proprietary ATI driver
[negative]	[04:21]	<chrissi>	xtknight: just remove .update-manager from home
[negative]	[04:21]	<askar>	epod:can I repair  mesagl?
[neutral]	[04:21]	<Tom47>	Huffalump: sudo restricted-manager

[neutral]	[04:21]	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: it was working earlier today, the only difference is that i upgraded to 6.10. nothing else got installed/added/modified
[negative]	[04:22]	<delire>	mrcreativity: do you know where to find a terminal?
[positive]	[04:22]	<sixth>	magnetron: i remember using it with beryl, worked great for me
[neutral]	[04:22]	<psycop>	magnetron they screwed up my system
[negative]	[04:22]	<benpicco>	fiery_cleric: strange, whatever I do, the blinkenlights on the modem say, thet it\'s doing nothing, no matter what port i choose, is there a terminal command that does the same as the button I\'m searching for?
[negative]	[04:22]	<psycop>	had to remove them
[neutral]	[04:22]	<delire>	mrcreativity: we'll type in a couple of commands to get output quickly.
[neutral]	[04:22]	<mrcreativity>	delire: yes i do
[neutral]	[04:22]	<xtknight>	LjL, pjesi have you manually compiled swig yet?
[positive]	[04:22]	<Huffalump>	Tom47, thanks!
[neutral]	[04:22]	<xtknight>	im just using multiverse swig
[neutral]	[04:22]	<magnetron>	!doesn't work > psycop
[positive]	[04:22]	<chrissi>	xtknight: that explains the weird behaviour for root mode: the first time i run it for root it creates the .update-manager directory there
[positive]	[04:22]	<mrcreativity>	delire: yes sir
[neutral]	[04:22]	<MistaED>	psycop: got feisty? get the nvidia-glx-new package instead, they work for the geforce 8 series
[negative]	[04:22]	<Whtiger>	My nice box just restarted for no reason. Logs don't say anything. There wasn't a power outage.
[neutral]	[04:22]	<chowmeined>	Whenever I change a partition in feisty it is automatically mounted, this is really annoying how do I turn this off?

[negative]	[04:26]	<tarelerulz>	I just want to see if anyone else might know for sure
[negative]	[04:26]	<joshjosh>	VividHazE, why would you need to stop it?
[neutral]	[04:26]	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: ifconfig -a gives me some info, no collisions or nothing. gets hardware address.. is there anything in particular there that would intrest you?
[negative]	[04:26]	<VividHazE>	it says I need to kill the Xserver before I can install the drivers

[negative]	[04:27]	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: u could try sudo ifup eth0
[negative]	[04:27]	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: dont know. it doesnt behave like mac (my main OS) so im drawing blanks...
[neutral]	[04:27]	<delire>	mrcreativity: cool... so, try to play some music now..

[negative]	[04:28]	<sree>	joshjosh, doesn't work
[neutral]	[04:28]	<delire>	mrcreativity: probably, though try a wave file for now.
[negative]	[04:28]	<VividHazE>	HOW DID I KILL THE XSERVER, is there a command?
[neutral]	[04:28]	<delire>	VividHazE: CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE
[negative]	[04:28]	<VividHazE>	doesn't that restart it?  I want it to stay off, so i'm in text mode
[negative]	[04:28]	<Linuturk>	hey guys, my menus aren't sorting entries alphabetically anymore. When I add an application, it doesn't got in ABC order
[neutral]	[04:28]	<benpicco>	fiery_cleric: thx, I\'ll read this
[negative]	[04:28]	<kbrooks>	VividHazE, CUT THE CAPS
[negative]	[04:29]	<Daverocks>	VividHazE: if you don't have a display manager running, it's killed
[negative]	[04:29]	<ompaul>	VividHazE, NO CAPS please, so /etc/init.d gdm stop
[neutral]	[04:29]	<xtknight>	"pjesi, LjL did you come across ""no pyuic found"" ?"

[positive]	[04:29]	<VividHazE>	thanks
[negative]	[04:29]	<sree>	joshjosh, I saw feisty upgrade on  update-manager then did that. it hung on 3rd party repo with error
[positive]	[04:29]	<Daverocks>	VividHazE: but you likely have gdm or something similar running, in which gdm will restart X. what ompaul said ;)
[neutral]	[04:29]	<nlap>	
[negative]	[04:29]	<joshjosh>	sree, hmm.
[neutral]	[04:29]	<delire>	VividHazE: get back to X with CTRL-ALT-F7
[neutral]	[04:29]	<sree>	joshjosh, then I removed the 3rd party repos
[negative]	[04:29]	<fiery_cleric>	hordur: have u looked in system->admin->networking ... check the settings ... then deactivate, activate

[neutral]	[04:30]	<Daverocks>	Digichrome: @HLINK
[negative]	[04:30]	<Linuturk>	magnetron, both ways. I'm thinking it might be some old .config file in my ~ from the upgrade
[negative]	[04:30]	<magnetron>	Digichrome: shred

[neutral]	[04:31]	<sree>	Anyone out there who can help me Upgrade Edgy to Feisty ?
[negative]	[04:31]	<Cosmo_>	well that was interesting, finally got my dual monitors working right and the problem ended up being a small flaw in NVIDIA's drivers not linux's fault, the silly software from nvidia wasn't saving the file to the xorg.conf like I was telling it to do

[neutral]	[04:33]	<masked_marsoe>	is there a way to rollback to 6.10?
[negative]	[04:33]	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: you just need to write /dev/urandom over it
[neutral]	[04:33]	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: you can change than in the terminal program (not bash)
[positive]	[04:33]	<erUSUL>	magnetron: ups, sorry ;)

[negative]	[04:34]	<sky__shark>	yeah
[negative]	[04:34]	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: randomish crap
[negative]	[04:34]	<sky__shark>	i did
[negative]	[04:34]	<delire>	tmccrar1: can't you just dd if=/dev/zero bs=2048 of=/mnt/disk/somefile  and then use something like wipe afterwards?
[neutral]	[04:34]	<britta_>	Is static IP WPA possible on Feisty?
[neutral]	[04:34]	<ryeth25>	hajhouse:  i thought the terminal was bash

[positive]	[04:34]	<Cosmo_>	moving on to the next problem, since installing Feisty I now have no sound
[neutral]	[04:34]	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: bash is the shell
[negative]	[04:34]	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: actually if you *really* wanted it to be pretty random, you'd dd /dev/audio over it and feed in white noise
[neutral]	[04:34]	<hajhouse>	ryeth25: bash runs in the terminal
[neutral]	[04:34]	<britta_>	Cosmo_ the same happens to me!!!

[negative]	[04:35]	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: but forget having to do 2000 passes or whatever people say you need
[positive]	[04:35]	<hordur>	fiery_cleric: tryed both enable/disable aswell as using manual ip and then change back to dhcp. still no go..
[negative]	[04:35]	<tmccrar1>	gordonjcp: Just once wouldn't do the trick, you'd do that mulitple times
[neutral]	[04:35]	<erUSUL>	matason: build-essential installs libc6-dev iirc
[negative]	[04:35]	<hordur>	delire: still no internet.. :(
[neutral]	[04:35]	<gordonjcp>	tmccrar1: once the data is overwritten once, the old data is gone forever

[negative]	[04:55]	<tue>	Hello. I have some serious network issues. I installed kubuntu feisty fawn on this computer 3 weeks ago, and after the official version was released i tried running adept to update the system. However, one package (dont know which) failed, and after this eth0 has failed. The only non-standard thing about the setup is that i has (by accident) run sudo chown (myusername) /etc -R. I has tried to correct this by running sudo chown root /etc -R.
[negative]	[04:55]	<tue>	Basically the problem is that when i run sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart i get a lot of problems like SIOCSIFFLAGS: Permission Denied, and eth0 does not get an ip (i cannot even ping the router)

[negative]	[05:27]	<tsmithe>	RJ-4945, it rather depends on the chipset inside the card. could you pastebin the output of `lsmod` and `lspci -vvn` please?
[negative]	[05:27]	<ceil420>	livecdquickq, i'm pretty sure you have to restart after installing...
[positive]	[05:27]	<Stinge1>	simonn - none, just the splash screen goes away and turns into a blinking cursor.

[neutral]	[05:31]	<IndyGunFreak>	!automatix
[negative]	[05:31]	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a CLOSED SOURCE script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[negative]	[05:51]	<phixnay>	Krishn1: try pressing ctrl-alt-F1, and then doing sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. You can leave the default options for most things, but pay special attention to the monitor part, and choose the vesa driver

[negative]	[05:53]	<nibsa1242_>	eztk its been a long night/day of trying to get my desktop box fixed... I'm quite annoyed at this upgrading process the one reason I moved from Fedora Core to Ubuntu was because I hated the way FC upgraded... I could do a memtest86+ I'm 95% sure it'll come out fine unless my computer decided to goto shit I've memtested these modules b4 and they were fine

[negative]	[06:00]	<LjL>	eztk: tried rebooting? how did you install the driver? are you on feisty?
[negative]	[06:00]	<eternalswd>	I'm having problems with feisty and my ati x300 card.  Initially it didn't load, so I set the driver to vesa and it loaded up.  I then tried setting it back to radeon which is what I had it as for edgy and restarted X and it restarted fine.  In the middle of watching a video, X died and I had to hard reboot.  Now it won't load even with vesa as a driver.  I booted up using edgy's kernel, and it worked, though X dies after a time on it now,
[neutral]	[06:00]	<eternalswd>	though it loads fine on startup.  I'm at a loss.

[neutral]	[06:14]	<xtknight>	billy, on a regular ubuntu.  not sure the difference
[neutral]	[06:14]	<slackern>	fabbos, yes if you choose to do a format they will be gone
[negative]	[06:14]	<RandomizeR>	i tried everything on the guide page, still no luck
[negative]	[06:14]	<SRed13>	And makes it look like a NTFS to windows
[neutral]	[06:14]	<magnetron_>	SRed13: yes
[neutral]	[06:14]	<Clampdown>	Frog29: thats different... so your cursor vanishes, but you can still blindly use it?
[negative]	[06:14]	<Frog29>	Nigromante - touchpad and usb..... i can move the mouse and everyonething i just can't see where it goes.... i also have cnrtl set up so i press it to see the location
[neutral]	[06:14]	<SRed13>	Ohhhhhhh
[negative]	[06:14]	<crouton>	SRed13: it does not look like ntfs to windows
[positive]	[06:14]	<xtknight>	billy, i use a lowlatency kernel though (actually selfcompiled with con kolivas interactivity patches).  great for everything
[neutral]	[06:14]	<kalifornia909>	anyone know why grub wont install to a raid array
[neutral]	[06:14]	<Frog29>	Clampdown yes
[negative]	[06:14]	<twasbrillg>	if I burn a feisty .iso, can I upgrade using that without loosing all of my data?
[negative]	[06:14]	<billy>	xtknight, beyond me, my homey.
[negative]	[06:14]	<crouton>	SRed13: it looks like a 'windows share' to other windows machines.
[neutral]	[06:14]	<ivx>	hey does anyone know why when i use ispconfig to create an ftp user that user can log on but he can't upload anything, it says permission denied?
[neutral]	[06:14]	<PriceChild>	twasbrillg, the alternate cd, not desktop
[negative]	[06:15]	<LjL>	eztk: well, if it's installed correctly, i'd just try rebooting
[negative]	[06:15]	<SRed13>	Oh, well thats Easy!

[negative]	[06:15]	<eztk>	LjL: ok
[neutral]	[06:15]	<Nigromante>	Frog29, can you see your mouse in console mode? do you have installed gpm?
[positive]	[06:15]	<xtknight>	billy, lol well i'd distribute debs of it on the forums.. i love this kernel
[negative]	[06:15]	<davidwinter>	hi all. I'd like to run Ubuntu for an arcade machine/pc thing. It's got an ArcadeVGA graphics card (based on ATI chipset...) just wondering what drivers I should us?
[neutral]	[06:15]	<davidwinter>	use*
[negative]	[06:15]	<yeti>	is there a difference between the kernel packages that ubuntu and debian ship or can i use a debian kernel package with ubuntu?
[negative]	[06:15]	<crouton>	SRed13: it can act like a NT4.0 PDC, if you're familiar with that.
[negative]	[06:15]	<IceGuest_7>	"kismet wont ""make"" anybody got any ideas for a newbie"
[neutral]	[06:15]	<Nigromante>	Frog29, do CTRL+ALT+F1
[negative]	[06:15]	<SRed13>	Ok, cool.
[negative]	[06:15]	<xtknight>	yeti, you can not use debian kernels with ubuntu if you want your system to work reliably
[neutral]	[06:15]	<SRed13>	You guys are smart.
[positive]	[06:15]	<PriceChild>	yeti, debian is not ubuntu. Do not use debian packages on ubuntu :)
[negative]	[06:15]	<Frog29>	Nigromante : ok
[positive]	[06:15]	<xtknight>	yeti, debian and ubuntu use different .config files
[negative]	[06:15]	<fabbos>	slackern, well idont want to format, but my upgrade failed, so what are my options.

[negative]	[06:16]	<blubloblu>	Anyone got ideas for me? Nvidia restricted driver doesnt work. All I have is vesa, which doesnt do 1600x1200 for some reason
[positive]	[06:16]	<ubotu>	Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See @HLINK - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[neutral]	[06:16]	<jukka>	Anybody know if NVU missing in Feisty 64-bit is a bug or has it been abandoned for some reason?
[negative]	[06:16]	<Frog29>	nigromante - not sure if i told you or someone else but it seems to happen after the monitor blanks
[negative]	[06:16]	<[1] ircusr>	why not
[negative]	[06:16]	<Derek__>	magnetron_: ok, so I disabeled the driver and reset, and now xorg doesn't have drivers to load with
[neutral]	[06:16]	<xtknight>	!nvu | jukka
[positive]	[06:16]	<ubotu>	jukka: nvu is a WYSIWYG and code dual-function HTML editor for easily creating web pages.  The original developer is working on a full rewrite; meanwhile, another is doing bugfixes.  It is not in the Ubuntu repos for Feisty Fawn, but ping tonyyarusso to inquire about packages.  See also !html.
[negative]	[06:16]	<kirkunit>	i think someone was in here the other week who had tried it
[negative]	[06:16]	<slackern>	fabbos, hmm not quite sure to be honest, a clean install but keep /home intact and maybe a backup of all the other stuff if there is something important you need to keep i guess
[negative]	[06:16]	<Derek__>	magnetron_: I'm in windows right now because all I get is text when I boot to linux.  I'm not sure how to fix that
[neutral]	[06:17]	<Frog29>	Nigromante : i'm in the console
[neutral]	[06:17]	<Hasrat_USA>	!html
[positive]	[06:17]	<ubotu>	html is HyperText Markup Language, used to build webpages. Editors in Ubuntu: Bluefish, Quanta+, Screem, and Nvu. For howto on HTML coding, see: @HLINK
[negative]	[06:17]	<yeti>	another question: if i want to compile my own kernel, is there any script that deactivates the modules in .config that i don't need (judging by lsmod for example)? i simply don't want to compile everything
[neutral]	[06:17]	<xtknight>	linux is user friendly.  it's just picky about who its friends are
[negative]	[06:17]	<Nigromante>	did your computer enter Suspension or Hibernation ?
[negative]	[06:17]	<slackern>	fabbos, i guess what you want is some kind of list of the software installed on the old system so you could get it back as soon as possible
[negative]	[06:17]	<eztk>	LjL: looks like X is working fine now. But font smoothing all gone now :( ill have to find a way to get that back

[negative]	[06:17]	<slackern>	fabbos, maybe having a backup of /var/log/dpkg.log so you can check which packages you have installed on the old system
[negative]	[06:17]	<fabbos>	slackern, k.  do you know of a good guide for that? Im sick of using guides written by noobs, i cant waste much moremtime getting my computer running.

[negative]	[06:18]	<aleksanteri>	ok
[neutral]	[06:18]	<xtknight>	Derek__, such as nvidia or ati?

[neutral]	[06:18]	<xtknight>	"Derek__, well grab the restricted drivers pkg then ""sudo modprobe DRIVERNAME"""

[positive]	[06:20]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.

[negative]	[07:10]	<bluefox83>	cox377,  ok, this is an easy fix actually...first to make sure everthing is working correctly, we're gonna have the system detect your hardware setup and create a new xorg.conf
[negative]	[07:10]	<cox377>	bluefox83: ok mate, cook
[neutral]	[07:10]	<ompaul>	to1, apt-cache search lib | less << might help and see what that
[neutral]	[07:10]	<bluefox83>	cox377, do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

[positive]	[07:16]	<antidrugue>	Frog29: yes, a very solid release indeed, pretty stable too
[neutral]	[07:16]	<bluefox83>	cox377, ah..ok lets just make this super easy... sudo apt-get install ubuntu desktop
[negative]	[07:16]	<z>	hey all, for some reason metacity doesnt start with my session now, i always have to type metacity in the terminal to bring up everything
[positive]	[07:16]	<Stig>	Yeah, I was really impressed that Feisty recognised my wireless card straight away...
[neutral]	[07:16]	<soundray>	kkerwin: you should install those packages with sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite
[negative]	[07:16]	<Frog29>	let me add my crazy question - somehow at some point i think i told ubuntu not to isntall certain updates....... now i can't figure out how to install those up[dates
[negative]	[07:16]	<bluefox83>	cox377, actually tht might be ubuntu-desktop
[neutral]	[07:16]	<vox754>	Stig, which one?
[neutral]	[07:16]	<kkerwin>	soundray: Thank you. Lemme give that a try.
[neutral]	[07:17]	<soundray>	kkerwin: hold on...
[positive]	[07:17]	<Frog29>	antidrugue - i think it still need better pwoer managment for laptops..... i beleive i get better perfermanec of battery life in windows

[positive]	[07:17]	<antidrugue>	Frog29: if you go in update manager, you can install any update available

[negative]	[07:18]	<soundray>	kkerwin: cd to /var/cache/apt/archives and use the full name of the deb file.
[neutral]	[07:18]	<bluefox83>	cox377, installing the ubuntu-desktop package will install gnome and xorg, and if i'm not mistaken, will also configure it for you...that should make life easier
[neutral]	[07:18]	<antidrugue>	Frog29: a few hints there: @HLINK

[neutral]	[07:18]	<vox754>	kkerwin, he said the card works, hence no need for ndiswrapper

[neutral]	[07:20]	<auridius>	bluefox83: It's a ebook, with everything covered in it, from desktop use to server

[negative]	[07:23]	<sky_shark>	does that mean java wasn't installed properly?

[negative]	[08:58]	<alexises>	jrib sorry
[positive]	[08:58]	<xtknight>	Hausberg, i recommend using the gparted livecd, you wont have problems with mountd partitions that way

[negative]	[08:59]	<sebrock>	xtknight, yeah I guess, gonna reinstall it using system rescue cd..., by the way, looks like it didnt detect my wifi either, 6.10 did...
[neutral]	[08:59]	<Hausberg>	xtknight you mean boot on livecd and then do the deed
[negative]	[08:59]	<jrib>	alexises: actually the gcc stuff is for dapper only.  But if you read the edgy description, it does explain where to find the Makefile you need
[negative]	[08:59]	<xtknight>	urlopen() fixed iteslf.  i just restarted the torrent
[positive]	[08:59]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: you must restart xorg hardware detection from pure textmode, without graphical environment, i believe..
[negative]	[08:59]	<etuardu>	Agrajag: no, it don't
[negative]	[08:59]	<kanpachi>	"can anyone help please, i can only get a refresh rate of 50 hz, and i used to get 85 hz on this res in dapper, and yes i've done ""sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"" and no luck :("
[negative]	[08:59]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: to achieve that, you must go to runlevel 1
[positive]	[08:59]	<xtknight>	Hausberg, gparted has its own livecd with only gparted on it.  or you could use an ubuntu livecd and run gparted yea that certianly works

[negative]	[08:59]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: telinit 1
[negative]	[08:59]	<xtknight>	sebrock, ahh ok.  i cant guarantee it will reinstall properly either.  it's probably a boot order thing.
[negative]	[09:00]	<xtknight>	sebrock, grub got installed it's just a matter of which MBR
[positive]	[09:00]	<crow>	Hi all, is there anyone hier that menaged to setup Wirelles with WPA(PSK) and new ubuntu network menager?
[neutral]	[09:00]	<echnaton>	how to fix that problem. i thought its a xorg problem
[neutral]	[09:00]	<xtknight>	sebrock, if you have multiple HDs try setting default to the other HDs,  do that until it boots properly.  and just use the HD that works since grub will boot windows also
[positive]	[09:00]	<sebrock>	xtknight, well both win and ubuntu is on the same disc
[negative]	[09:00]	<oo_seven>	i have a couple of questions conserning the configuration of the gnome window manager that ships with ubuntu. i hope thats rightt channl for this purpose
[negative]	[09:00]	<Agrajag>	etuardu: you're probably going to have to boot a livecd and chek that your /etc/sudoers file and /etc/group file are correct
[negative]	[09:00]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ctrl+alt+F1, log in as user and do sudo telinit 1

[negative]	[09:01]	<g35>	is there anyway to make GRUB look nicer, i mean in terms of a GUI?  So like can you assign images for the different menu options or somethign of the like?

[positive]	[09:02]	<oo_seven>	ok, stretching the icons works fine, thought i can maybe set them all to one size as well as default size for new icons
[neutral]	[09:02]	<Impaque>	verb3k: alternate is the way to go. i used it because the default LiveCD didn't offer xfs fs

[neutral]	[09:03]	<verb3k>	Impaque: Thanks ...I will try that.....but is it the same as debian's text mode installation ? because I am familiar with that

[negative]	[09:03]	<z0man>	How come my screen rrerefresh rate defaults back 50hz even though i need it at 54
[negative]	[09:03]	<xtknight>	verb3k, yes it's the exact same as deb's text style

[negative]	[09:04]	<makkk>	hi all. i did an upgrade to Feisty. For some reason, I dont think My network manager looks quite like it should according to the screenshots i've seen. How can I get that list of networks with associated strengths, WPA, etc?

[neutral]	[09:05]	<Zorlin>	that you select the correct refresh rates
[negative]	[09:05]	<Zorlin>	otherwise they wont be enabled.
[neutral]	[09:05]	<raboof>	does ubuntu use suspend2 or swsusp?
[negative]	[09:05]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: did you go to runlevel 1 beforehand? if you did, you couldn't go back to alt+f7
[positive]	[09:05]	<predaeus>	ah it depends on the xmms-dev package in Xubuntu. now it works .... wheeee :-)

[negative]	[09:09]	<Prognatus>	Hello, I have a problem: if I boot with the screen cable out, Ubuntu defaults to 640x480. I've tried to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf but it didn't work. How do I tell Ubuntu to always boot 1280x1024 in 24-bit colors?
[negative]	[09:09]	<ccannon>	   if I have an apt-get update running in a term win in xwindows, and I restart xwin, will the apt-get update stop?

[neutral]	[09:10]	<Zorlin>	If not I suggest you use sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, to disable all resolutions except 1280x1024.
[negative]	[09:10]	<Impaque>	Prognatus: 640x480 should be enough for anybody (tm)
[negative]	[09:10]	<xtknight>	oftentimes my Trash doesnt appear full when it should be.  anyone else have this trouble?

[negative]	[09:26]	<ApesMa>	The Edgy->Feisty upgrade seems to have left diversions lying around that keep me from installing nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new. I want to try to use dpkg-divert to manually get rid of the diversions, but can't figure out which pathname goes first in the command line. The diversions file that lists diversions lists things in sets of three lines: path1, path2, package. Which of the two paths should go first in the dpkg-divert command line?
[neutral]	[09:26]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: hmm, the reconfigure should've reconfigured it as it was from the time you installed it the first time.. are you sure you were in pure textmode?
[negative]	[09:26]	<jasin>	evil, it was setup by default on my system all I had to do is enter the keyring pass.
[negative]	[09:26]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: (when you did the reconfigure, that is)

[neutral]	[09:27]	<g35>	Zorlin, hi
[negative]	[09:27]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: perhaps, though, it was the dpkg reconfig that i did before i followed your directions that fucked it up
[neutral]	[09:27]	<knt>	"I updated from 6.10 to FF and it detected my "".ko"" modules as not permitted format"
[negative]	[09:27]	<bluefox83>	tuxplorer, when you tell it to reload, it'll update all your sources, and say there's a new version available..click on the upgrade button because doing it any other way would be a serious migrane
[negative]	[09:27]	<evil>	jasin: ok, but i decided to turn off DHCP on router and use WPA2
[neutral]	[09:27]	<ApesMa>	knt: I believe the switch to .ko happened w/2.6 kernel, so yes.

[positive]	[09:44]	<PriceChild>	xtknight, to leave enough ram incase something suddenly needs to use it
[neutral]	[09:44]	<Agrajag>	xtknight: stuff that isn't being used will be swapped out to leave physical ram free in case it's needed in a hurry

[negative]	[09:46]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: this is just a bit stressful
[negative]	[09:46]	<Horscht>	is there something like ICS on Linux/ubuntu?
[negative]	[09:47]	<xtknight>	i do understand the concept of 'get rid of ram when a new app needs it'  but there's more physical left than swap used
[negative]	[09:47]	<danboland>	aww, so i go to waste another cd.... i guess i can use this cd for another comp.  thanks, i'll go download it.  any idea what changed between versions that would cause it to fail now?

[neutral]	[09:47]	<stefg>	!firestarter | Horscht
[positive]	[09:47]	<ubotu>	Horscht: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see @HLINK or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

[neutral]	[09:47]	<xtknight>	Agrajag, ah it tells me 1968 used physical though that's probably allocated not 'used'
[negative]	[09:48]	<Agrajag>	xtknight: right now 1.5 gigs of my ram is being used for buffers
[negative]	[09:48]	<Nessieliberation>	xtknight, that's the one i meant

[negative]	[09:48]	<xtknight>	ah
[positive]	[09:48]	<aimes>	:D
[neutral]	[09:48]	<Agrajag>	xtknight: it is used, linux will use as much physical ram as possible for disk caching
[neutral]	[09:48]	<RasQulec>	kitsuneofdoom: look for some alsa configuration pages online
[neutral]	[09:48]	<Huffalump>	My sound card is mostly static with very little sound.  How can I fix this?  Yes, I've checked the alsamixer which gives me sound with lots of static.  Feisty, fresh install, Audigy SoundBlaster.

[negative]	[09:48]	<Alon_005>	I'll be on my way.
[negative]	[09:48]	<xtknight>	Agrajag, ah i see.  so maybe my 500m of used swap is in that 1900megs of phys ram also
[negative]	[09:48]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ok, ctrl+alt+F1 will get you to the first terminal. from there, after you login as user, you can issue /etc/init.d/?dm stop .. to stop xorg/gnome.. then you do the sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg .. and restart gnome: sudo /etc/init.d/?dm start
[negative]	[09:48]	<xtknight>	thats my guess
[neutral]	[09:48]	<RasQulec>	Huffalump: did you fix the digital output switch in alsamixer?
[positive]	[09:49]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: write it down this time please ;)

[neutral]	[09:49]	<ikkebr>	anyone running opera in feisty?
[negative]	[09:49]	<Agrajag>	xtknight: no, that would kind of defeat the purpose of swap space
[neutral]	[09:49]	<forQed>	I just got Opera working with an update today
[neutral]	[09:49]	<xtknight>	Agrajag, why...when a new app needed the phys ram it oculd just get rid of the physical ram and itd be also in the swap, synchronized.
[negative]	[09:49]	<petriborg>	is there an official howto somewhere on turning on beryl for feisty?
[negative]	[09:49]	<Agrajag>	xtknight: there's definitely something in your swap space, it's just stuff you don't need now and haven't used in a long time
[negative]	[09:49]	<RasQulec>	Agrajag: that would make it so if it needed the ram it wouldnt have to copy to swap since its already in swap.
[negative]	[09:49]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i have been writing all of this down, but due to SOMETHING i did earlier, ctrl-alt-f1 doesn't do anything anymore
[negative]	[09:49]	<forQed>	Until todays update Opera would not owrk
[neutral]	[09:49]	<xtknight>	yea
[negative]	[09:49]	<Juanca>	anyone could help me with this problem (@HLINK with the 7.04 installation CD??

[negative]	[09:50]	<Agrajag>	RasQulec: why would you put your swap space in ram, that makes no sense
[neutral]	[09:50]	<Nessieliberation>	forQed, which update?
[negative]	[09:50]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: hm, try to restart then?
[negative]	[09:50]	<Agrajag>	or even cache it to ram
[neutral]	[09:50]	<POVaddct>	RobbieCrash: got the firmware for bcm43xx installed?

[neutral]	[09:50]	<forQed>	an update for Opera was brought up in my automatic updates
[negative]	[09:50]	<xtknight>	Agrajag, because it's slower to read from swap.  when there's free ram you'd want to use it somehow/

[negative]	[09:50]	<Nessieliberation>	oki, so not the kernel update i thought i might have seen
[negative]	[09:50]	<RasQulec>	Agrajag: no, you have it stored in both places so you dont have to wait for it to copy to the hd when you need that ram area, you just clear the ram area out and use it
[neutral]	[09:50]	<Agrajag>	xtknight: right, and the prupose of swap is to store things you don't need in a slower store
[negative]	[09:50]	<Huffalump>	RasQulec, can you point me in the right direction?  I don't see where to change that.
[neutral]	[09:51]	<forQed>	I installed Opera with Automatix
[neutral]	[09:51]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: i will try restarting
[neutral]	[09:51]	<Agrajag>	RasQulec: that would work

Windows Vista requires all hardware connect to it to have DRM incorperated into it in order to view the extremely high video resolution.. What this translates too is that all hardware produced in the future could have DRM in it. The very nature of GPL forbids DRM which will doom linux because it will hardware will be impossible to find

[neutral]	[10:20]	<Horscht>	yes, DaMi3n
[negative]	[10:20]	<eck>	michael: it doesn't matter what the name is, you just need to chmod it
[negative]	[10:20]	<Horscht>	that's exactly my problem
[neutral]	[10:20]	<teitunge>	michael: the name doesnt matter: just chmod it
[neutral]	[10:21]	<teitunge>	don
[negative]	[10:21]	<pavon>	michael - the name isn't important - you need to change the permisions with chmod

[negative]	[10:22]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: is this worth the effort of fixing, or should i just reinstall?
[negative]	[10:22]	<Impaque>	Impaque: strange.. because dpkg-reconfigure does exactly that: it restores xorg.conf to the state it was in before you changed anything manually..
[negative]	[10:22]	<deebus>	oh
[negative]	[10:22]	<POVaddct>	kevinS2: thats another questtion. i cannot help you with that, i dont do web programming.

[negative]	[10:23]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: yeah, i know
[positive]	[10:23]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: ;)
[neutral]	[10:23]	<soundray>	lino16: you can probably fix this with 'sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/metacity-common_1%3a2.18.2-0ubuntu1_all.deb'. Run apt-get -f install again afterwards to see if it fixed it.
[neutral]	[10:23]	<smo>	kevinS2          sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

[neutral]	[10:23]	<pavon>	"in the ""Software Sources"" App what does a dash mean (as opposed to a check)?"
[neutral]	[10:23]	<billy>	has the pressure on the servers dropped any?
[negative]	[10:23]	<OZStriker>	eck: I mean that only one interface can be active. If I turn on another - first will go down
[negative]	[10:23]	<cox377>	i'm having this issue when i'm trying to install the new ubuntu from cd, i select insta,, then when i select the drive i go /manual/drive i delete the current ntfs partition and  then select the new one, however when i go make the changes it says i havent selected a root, but i dont see any root optiomns
[positive]	[10:23]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: well, you can try moving xorg.conf to, say, xorg.conf.backup-again before you start dpkg-reconfigure (maybe it reads it)
[negative]	[10:23]	<eck>	OZStriker: are you starting them with ifconfig?
[negative]	[10:23]	<robdeman>	hey folks... is there any good reason to upgrade to Ubuntu 7 when running Server Edition with LAMP only?
[negative]	[10:23]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: hmm
[neutral]	[10:23]	<Kraeloc>	i will try that
[neutral]	[10:24]	<robdeman>	Im now runnung 6.10 Server/LAMP
[negative]	[10:24]	<OZStriker>	smo: What you mean - edit? There is everything fine there
[negative]	[10:24]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: to start clean, config-less, so to speak, but apart from that i have no other ideas :((
[positive]	[10:24]	<billfur>	teitunge: apperently noacpi does not play well with smp
[neutral]	[10:24]	<smo>	what s your card Kraeloc?
[negative]	[10:24]	<robdeman>	not sure why I would want to upgrade to 7
[negative]	[10:24]	<jrsims>	hey, what's the name of the MS TrueType font package?
[negative]	[10:24]	<Kraeloc>	impaque: ok, well thanks for trying
[neutral]	[10:24]	<Nergar>	hello fiestyseans!!
[neutral]	[10:24]	<Huffalump>	robdeman, I recommend you wait if you are running anything important at all
[negative]	[10:24]	<smo>	what s the xact problem so OZstriker?
[neutral]	[10:24]	<soundray>	cox377: it means that you have to assign '/' as the mount point to one of your partitions.
[negative]	[10:24]	<Kraeloc>	smo: radeon 9000, but video is not the problem
[negative]	[10:24]	<Impaque>	Kraeloc: np :(
[positive]	[10:24]	<eck>	OZStriker: check that one of them actually goes down with ifconfig, if not I think it is a routing problem and you can investigate with route
[negative]	[10:24]	<cox377>	soundray: how do i go about douing that?
[negative]	[10:24]	<Journeyman>	how can you get ubuntu to reconfigure xorg?
[neutral]	[10:24]	<lino16>	soundray: now this error message: @HLINK
[neutral]	[10:24]	<Nergar>	anyone using a bcm43xx wifi card in feisty???
[positive]	[10:25]	<soundray>	cox377: see for yourself -- just hit the slash (/) key where you are asked to enter the mount point.
[neutral]	[10:25]	<Huffalump>	lino16, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[negative]	[10:25]	<OZStriker>	eck: It's not going down with ifconfig. It's DNS problem I think
[negative]	[10:25]	<eck>	OZStriker: you need to be careful with two ports because if your routes aren't set up right all the traffic will go overone card and not hte other
[neutral]	[10:25]	<Impaque>	bye peeps
[neutral]	[10:25]	<karim>	what is the runlevel of the singleuser mode ?
[neutral]	[10:25]	<soundray>	lino16: running sudo apt-get -f install once or twice will fix this
[neutral]	[10:26]	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[negative]	[10:26]	<Huffalump>	sorry lino16
[negative]	[10:26]	<OZStriker>	eck: I can't make two default routes - but I need them
[neutral]	[10:26]	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: for DNS check the contents of /etc/resolv.conf
[neutral]	[10:26]	<eck>	OZStriker: you can change the metric with route if you need to
[neutral]	[10:27]	<zeer>	i play counter strike on wine
[negative]	[10:27]	<eck>	OZStriker: so the LAN stuff has a lower metric than everything else, so that route will be used
[positive]	[10:27]	<zeer>	but it is much slower than on edgy!
[negative]	[10:27]	<Resister>	hi, I would like to watch online streaming video's in opera browser.. what do i have to install? i run ubuntu feisty fawn, opera 9.20
[negative]	[10:27]	<zeer>	anyone knows why?...
[neutral]	[10:27]	<billy>	are desktop.iso seeders still in fairly high demand?
[neutral]	[10:27]	<zeer>	i'm using the default ubuntu fglrx driver
[neutral]	[10:27]	<Journeyman>	Huffalump: it says xserver-xorg is not installed
[negative]	[10:27]	<kevinS1>	I get this error messange: httpd (no pid file) not running
[negative]	[10:27]	<OZStriker>	POVaddct: I understand that? but once ADSL is connecting - it's rewriting resolv.conf file and killing DNS's of local-net iface
[negative]	[10:27]	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, you have no X installed?
[neutral]	[10:28]	<Journeyman>	Huffalump: i do
[negative]	[10:28]	<Journeyman>	i just upgraded to feisty
[negative]	[10:28]	<OZStriker>	eck: I've tried that already and nothing was happened
[neutral]	[10:28]	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, then you have stumped me, because that is the command to reconfigure X
[negative]	[10:28]	<Journeyman>	and I am locked out of gnome, I am pretty sure its an xorg.conf problem
[neutral]	[10:28]	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: look at the usepeerdns setting in your ppp/pppoe config and disable it
[negative]	[10:28]	<jughead>	I just installed the Kubuntu 7.04 DVD and I have internet access through wireless but I cannot access my router (192.168.1.1) or even ping it.  How might I address this issue?
[neutral]	[10:28]	<Huffalump>	Journemany, if you like, you can:  (sudo) nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[neutral]	[10:28]	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: so pppd will never change the resolv.conf file
[neutral]	[10:28]	<sc0tch>	Is there a FAQ/Howto on compiling a custom kernel on Feisty?
[neutral]	[10:29]	<Huffalump>	Journeyman
[negative]	[10:29]	<Huffalump>	Journeyman, where sudo is needed if you are not in recovery mode
[negative]	[10:29]	<piglit>	when partitionning with 7.04 i need to make a root partition in a logical volume (LVM) but when i try to name it / it tell's me: logical volume or volume group names mau only contain alphanumeric characters, hyephen,plus, period and underscore and bla bla bla but the question is how do i tell Ubuntu what the logical volume root partition is??
[negative]	[10:29]	<OZStriker>	POVaddct: Ok. But the routing problem is still on
[neutral]	[10:29]	<lino16>	soundray: it runs correcty now. thanks. why must i three times apt-get -f install?
[neutral]	[10:29]	<soundray>	sc0tch: the old tutorials apply. Look at ubotu's private message please

[positive]	[10:30]	<sc0tch>	Thanks for the links soundray.
[positive]	[10:30]	<POVaddct>	OZStriker: there is also a setting for that
[negative]	[10:30]	<soundray>	lino16: it's like a cascade, one thing depends on another, and you can't configure it unless that other thing is configured already.
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Fylk>	......Can't help you then.
[neutral]	[10:30]	<maxime>	hi

[neutral]	[10:32]	<POVaddct>	"OZStriker: ""nothing interesting"" is a bit vague..."
[negative]	[10:32]	<Fylk>	piglit: once you've created the drive, there should be a drop down that lets you do that. I think they call it he mount point or some such.
[positive]	[10:32]	<eck>	OZStriker: I still think that it is a routing issue (not DNS), you probably need to check the kernel routing table more closely
[negative]	[10:32]	<smo>	just start it not restart kevinS1

[neutral]	[10:35]	<Lobosque>	Fylk i remember that i must type something to mount the fat32 drive
[negative]	[10:35]	<fuoco>	is there some kind of file sharing with zeroconf solution ?
[positive]	[10:35]	<Lobosque>	i made it some years ago
[negative]	[10:36]	<AaronMT>	hmm flash still locks up firefox sometimes (youtube)
[negative]	[10:36]	<fade_>	scarter: it's easier to install the packages from here @HLINK than to mess with fwcutter
[positive]	[10:36]	<Fylk>	Lobosque: Ok, that's a little better. So, when you go to the computer, it gives you the error.....shouldn't have too. fat32 is universally supported.

[positive]	[10:43]	<cotton>	thanks ffm, does it work in gnome?

[neutral]	[10:43]	<scarter>	fade_: like i said, the bcm43xx is working... didn't really want windows drivers either. maybe i'll live with it, it supports wep, wpa, wpa2... so anyway, thanks.

[negative]	[10:51]	<Jimbo99>	hey guys, i have had an issue with how smb works for some time now.  What I want to do with smb is to browse to a network computer using nautilus.  then find a share and folder, then open that and have it mount as if it is a folder on my system--similar to the way you mount another local drive--it becomes a folder in the file system.  I absolutely detest the way smb seems to work where it doesn't actually mount but creates a stream to 
[neutral]	[10:51]	<erUSUL>	ffm: 25
[neutral]	[10:51]	<redondos>	fade_uk: It should work with apt-get/aptitude but I won't rely on it.
[negative]	[10:51]	<Cafe_>	how can i generate an ISO image of an cd/dvd?
[neutral]	[10:51]	<ffm>	thank,s erUSUL, fade_uk
[negative]	[10:51]	<Abom>	sor: I'm online with an ethernet cable right now though, so I am in ubuntu (7.04 btw)
[neutral]	[10:51]	<ardchoille>	Cafe_: mkisofs
[negative]	[10:52]	<fade_uk>	to be fair I did it during pre-release with aptitude and it took me a while to get everything sorted
[neutral]	[10:52]	<cotton>	Were us LAMP in 7.04?
[neutral]	[10:52]	<khvn>	hey
[negative]	[10:52]	<_kaidaikonquerer>	is there anything I can do? How do I register my nick?
[negative]	[10:52]	<Abom>	sor: I also couldn't get the wirless to work in 6... and I tried wi-fi radar also, got the same thing, said I was connected but nothing
[negative]	[10:52]	<tbuss>	Jimbo99: don't know if this helps but I started using ssh instead of smb
[neutral]	[10:52]	<Huffalump>	cotton, can you rephrase that question?
[negative]	[10:52]	<soundray>	Abom: no, they are part of the kernel, but get loaded dynamically. Check if you have a module called rt2570 by running 'lsmod | grep rt2570'

[positive]	[10:52]	<ubotu>	cotton: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[positive]	[10:52]	<fade_uk>	from memory the release notes said something about using update-manager for problem-free upgrading

[positive]	[10:53]	<fade_uk>	so again, anybody know if it's possible to install the binary drivers for both ATI and Nvidia at the same time? the pacakge conflict with each other
[negative]	[10:53]	<khvn>	the -386 one doesn't work
[positive]	[10:53]	<khvn>	the -generic one works
[neutral]	[10:53]	<ffm>	!botabuse > AaronMT
[negative]	[10:53]	<Jimbo99>	doing it the way they seem to do it is almost ludicrous.  i simply want to mount the shares.
[positive]	[10:53]	<khvn>	it also trashed my nvidia drivers which I installed with envy
[negative]	[10:53]	<Cafe_>	i tried point mkisofs to the mount point of my cd. it created an image. but is that image an copy of the files? or is it identical as the cd? (bootable)
[negative]	[10:53]	<ardchoille>	fade_uk: Of course they conflict. Why would one need both?
[negative]	[10:53]	<Journeyman>	how do you down grade back to edgy?

[negative]	[10:54]	<tbuss>	"fiesty upgrade is stuck at 77% ""Gathering information for installation report.."" Should I reboot and try again."
[negative]	[10:54]	<khvn>	i had to change xorg.conf from 'nvidia' to 'nv'

[negative]	[10:54]	<Abom>	SoR: I can connect fine in windows with its automatic wirless thingy
[negative]	[10:54]	<khvn>	envy doesn't work because it can't install linux headers

[neutral]	[10:54]	<Cafe_>	artee, i think so!!
[negative]	[10:54]	<Abom>	soundray: I typed what you said and nothing came back, so that means I don't have it right? how do i install it with the synaptic pack manager?

[negative]	[10:55]	<Huffalump>	z3r0ph3wl, just ask away, no need for formalities
[negative]	[10:55]	<erUSUL>	latoo: maybe you need to configure/install some plug in...
[positive]	[10:55]	<soundray>	Abom: it means that you don't have it, but it also means that your card is probably supported by another module. How is your card connected - PCI or USB?
[neutral]	[10:55]	<Abom>	soundray: PCI

[negative]	[10:56]	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - have you come accross a problem? Oh and you are presumably going to need to use xinerama for your multi-monitor support so I think that will reduce the utility of using the binary drivers...

[negative]	[10:57]	<khvn>	just upgraded from xubuntu edgy to feisty, it also updated linux kernel. the -386 one doesn't work, the -generic one works. it also trashed my nvidia drivers which I installed with envy. i had to change xorg.conf from 'nvidia' to 'nv'. i want my nvidia drivers back!  envy doesn't work because it can't install linux headers. apt-get install nvidia-glx-legacy (i have a geforce2) doesn't work too - it can't remove old nvidia-glx for some reason.
[neutral]	[10:57]	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - Im tri-head here too,
[positive]	[10:57]	<Huffalump>	[1] ircusr, be specific.  It works for most, but not for some.  You have to share details

[negative]	[11:00]	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - hmm must be an nvidia thing then, both my ports are listed, although only one of them identified as what it is... in my xorg.conf I use the same bus ID for the two (ports) devices (which are then listed in 2x screens)

[positive]	[11:03]	<Gunrun>	(step 7 is the final step)
[positive]	[11:04]	<ajehuk>	fade_uk - just one thing - the CPU usage you are seeing is a bit strange - what process is making use of it?
[negative]	[11:04]	<muxx>	latoo: it could be related. I don't really know about this as I don't need daap functionality

[negative]	[11:11]	<ajehuk>	surviver - i.e. an incomming odf file in email wont take over your PC but recieving a source package, and then randomly installing it as root would be a bad idea.  Linux is just as potentially vulnerable as windows - its just that the automatic spreading is damn near impossible and privillage escalation is harder as you probably dont use root.

[neutral]	[11:17]	<variant>	shawn34: from dapper

[positive]	[11:18]	<Yadra>	bruenig, you're probably right, it's frustrating that netppm isn't more user-friendly and popular, it's so powerful

[neutral]	[11:50]	<frank_>	salut
[neutral]	[11:50]	<LegoLinux>	Hi
[neutral]	[11:50]	<deserteagle>	can someone help me with some nasty nvidia drivers issues?
[neutral]	[11:50]	<kernel06>	is there a way i can use msfonts in system wise in ubuntu. my fonts doesn't look good in my ibm laptop. just finished loading 7.04.
[negative]	[11:50]	<frank_>	iam an new ubuntu user and have massive problems with the flash plugin for firefox
[negative]	[11:50]	<LegoLinux>	I have a problem with the nVidia driver for Ubuntu
[neutral]	[11:51]	<argesarg>	What is stopping good ATI drivers from being maid copyright laws?
[negative]	[11:51]	<cotton>	ardchoille: :( Would it be damaging if I just change the permission of /var/www temporarily
[positive]	[11:51]	<frank_>	LegoLinux:  me not, installed very fine
[positive]	[11:51]	<cotton>	so I can move the files
[neutral]	[11:51]	<argesarg>	And ATI being a bitch
[neutral]	[11:51]	<ajehuk>	argesarg - probably ATI
[negative]	[11:51]	<Hasrat_USA>	okay thanks let's try that idefix
[negative]	[11:51]	<ardchoille>	cotton: That's not a wise practice, you would be better off trying to find out why sudo cp -r isn't working when it should.
[negative]	[11:51]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, if you want to use it in windows
[negative]	[11:51]	<deserteagle>	LegoLinux: maybe i can help, im having issues with nvidia drivers too
[negative]	[11:51]	<spikeb>	ATI can't write windows drivers either, so i think they have nobody to blame but themselves.
[neutral]	[11:51]	<bkiller>	hi gus
[neutral]	[11:51]	<LegoLinux>	My X server has crashed and it can't get up
[neutral]	[11:51]	<bkiller>	hi guys
[positive]	[11:51]	<idefixx>	Hasrat_USA: that'll work rename was the completely wrong command ;)
[negative]	[11:52]	<argesarg>	Well what advantage is it to leave the drivers in and not use the effects?
[neutral]	[11:52]	<frank_>	LegoLinux: make sure you change the driver loine from nv to nvdia
[negative]	[11:52]	<deserteagle>	LegoLinux: what does it say at the end?
[negative]	[11:52]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, i want to keep all my downloaded files on it and my /home directories
[neutral]	[11:52]	<LegoLinux>	done that
[neutral]	[11:52]	<LegoLinux>	still crashed
[neutral]	[11:52]	<deserteagle>	does it say NVIDIA module not found?
[negative]	[11:52]	<necr0mancer>	Can somebody help me with my sound?
[negative]	[11:52]	<spikeb>	if the open source driver supports your card, there is no advantage to using ati's drivers other than games.
[negative]	[11:52]	<LegoLinux>	Nope
[neutral]	[11:52]	<Journeyman>	LegoLinux if you just upgraded to feisty good luck!
[positive]	[11:52]	<randomwalker>	you can make sudo not foget passwords using timestamp_timeout=-1 :) i've been trying to figure out how to do that for ever

[neutral]	[11:53]	<necr0mancer>	Anyone having trouble with sound on feisty?
[neutral]	[11:53]	<Hor|zon>	IncredibleHink, well grub only understands msdos disk labels so if you're using the stock ubuntu bootloader and you possibly wan to bott off of it in the future then you need the msdos disk label
[positive]	[11:53]	<spikeb>	jez: i did a fresh install.

[neutral]	[11:54]	<Tim02>	but that doesnt work
[negative]	[11:54]	<IncredibleHink>	Hor|zon, if not, is there a better choice or does it matter?
[negative]	[11:54]	<jez>	Did anybody manage to either do an over-install or an upgrade, rather than a full blown install?

[negative]	[11:54]	<Tim02>	does anybody know what command i should try?

00:00	<ubuntuROX>	its waiting on you t accept it.
00:00	<f0rmat>	may i ask exactly who are the coders of ubuntu are they just everyone or anyone?
00:00	<cygoku>	goat|work ... Windows is not there at all anymore, I installed over it
00:00	<barslow>	x1250: wasnt able to actually get into ubuntu and I dont know enough terminal to diagnose
00:00	<oddalot>	ubuntoROX it won't let me send private msgs on this server, don't know if that will affect sending files as well
00:00	<RyanPrior>	matt____: If the LiveCD doesn't work, it's likely to be a graphics card driver problem.
00:00	<goat|work>	cygoku: oh
00:00	<Saladin>	Oh wow!
00:00	<ubuntuROX>	have an email address?
00:00	<Saladin>	Auto 3D windows
00:00	<PePa>	will I need to boot from the alt.CD, or can I just ...
00:00	<oddalot>	oddalot@yahoo.com
00:00	<maco>	PePa: no just have to mount it and add it as a repository
00:00	<goat|work>	cygoku: yes, then if you have,  sure
00:00	<tanath>	f0rmat, you can find more info about that on launchpad.net
00:00	<dragao-azul>	how can graphics card problems be solved in the live cd?
00:01	<Fishscene>	Who had the pink window problem in this screenshot? http://www.multigesture.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/screenshot.png
00:01	<f0rmat>	tanath, thankyou
00:01	<barslow>	RyanPrior: One last question, I have compiz and all my themes setup just the way I like them, will they stay the same after the uprgrade (I'm using AWN with modified Mac4lin and Compiz is all set perfect)
00:01	<matt____>	RyanPrior: perhaps...but 7.10 is working fine. how could i check/fix though? the live cd takes me to a "busybox", not a normal terminal.
00:01	<x1250>	barslow: /var/log/Xorg.0.log is the place to look, or ~/.xsession-errors
00:01	<goat|work>	cygoku: i wont be able to watch the channel, so if you have more q's message me
00:01	<arbrandes>	dragao-azul, use "safe graphics mode"
00:01	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, any advice?
00:01	<tanath>	barslow, should be no change
00:01	<cygoku>	goat|work ... Thank you, and sorry for my rudeness earlier
00:01	<barslow>	hmm
00:01	<PePa>	OK
00:01	<RyanPrior>	barslow: I'd just about bet that something will break and you'll spend hours reconfiguring things. Upgrades tend to mess with your stuff.
00:01	<dragao-azul>	abrandes, then how can i solve the problems? make my ati card work fine?
00:01	<PePa>	thanks Maco
00:01	<maco>	Fishscene: nvidia driver quality
00:01	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, did you answer my  last question?
00:01	<kilrae>	can you mount an encrypted lvm in Vista?
00:01	<tanath>	barslow, actually..
00:01	<oddalot>	i wonder how nerdy it would be if all these 1500 people where in a room at one time
00:01	<sileni>	he i installed build essential and tried to "make" but i get this error http://pastebin.com/m6dda8b39
00:02	<ubuntuROX>	there you go,, thats the one thats set for resolution auto,  it should work for you.
00:02	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, are you able to get a DHCP IP from the router?
00:02	<barslow>	ryanprior: im just gunna stick with gutsy then
00:02	<maco>	barslow: should stay, yes
00:02	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, no - i get "No DHCPOFFERS received"
00:02	<oddalot>	ok thanks, let me try it
00:02	<ubuntuROX>	modes anyhow
00:02	<barslow>	wow conflicting opinions
00:02	<tanath>	barslow, it may switch to the new default theme, but you can save your current theme/settings, and switch back after upgrade
00:02	<Jimdb>	matt___try a different CD reader...try adding ide=nodma on command line when you boot into the installer.
00:02	<RyanPrior>	oddalot: That's the Ubuntu Live conference. :-)
00:02	<laeg>	barslow: stick with gutsy forever?
00:02	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, do you know your routers ip address? 192.168.1.1?
00:02	<matt____>	RyanPrior: perhaps...but 7.10 is working fine. how could i check/fix though? the live cd takes me to a "busybox", not a normal terminal.
00:02	<sileni>	i dont understand how to change the flags
00:02	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, 192.168.0.1
00:02	<tanath>	barslow, i didn't have that problem though
00:02	<sileni>	like that error states
00:02	<barslow>	laeg: i dont want to but i dont wanna risk having to reformat my HD again
00:02	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, are you using KDE or Gnome?
00:02	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, gnome
00:02	<Fishscene>	Maco: it looked like the "mirror" or "shadow" (I forgot which) option in Compiz could fix that issue (Disabling the mirror or shadow effects)
00:03	<oddalot>	RyanPriot: Where is this ubuntu live conference?
00:03	<mohbana>	can i install ubuntu from a ntfs? without the wubi thing? i don't have a dvd to burn it on
00:03	<oddalot>	err when too
00:03	<maco>	barslow: your compiz settings will be saved.  there are more features in the new compiz though, so you might want to explore them after you upgrade
00:03	<basso>	I Love You All!
00:03	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, have you tried setting your IP to 192.168.0.100, your netmask to 255.255.255.0, and your gateway to 192.168.0.1?
00:03	<tanath>	barslow, there's always a risk when upgrading. personally, it fixed a lot of stuff for me, and i had minimal issues
00:03	<matt____>	RyanPrior: well, what would i search google for to fix this graphics card setting?
00:03	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, I have (with 192.168.0.200) as .100 is already taken
00:03	<tanath>	barslow, and none of my settings in anything changed
00:03	<ubuntuROX>	I think its faster than gutsy was.
00:03	<RyanPrior>	barslow: It's certainly possible that you could upgrade and have everything work perfectly - the Ubuntu developers certainly try hard to make that happen. You can't bet on it, though.
00:03	<Flannel>	mohbana: there are ways to install without burning, check it out: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
00:03	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, is 192.168.0.101 taken?
00:03	<oddalot>	brb
00:04	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, yes
00:04	<Saladin>	Hm.
00:04	<LOVElinux>	salve a tutti!
00:04	<RyanPrior>	matt____: Google and the Ubuntu Forums are good places to search.
00:04	<DBautell>	heh, "select best server" "no suitable server was found"
00:04	<tanath>	yeah, it's faster :D
00:04	<barslow>	tanath: i am correct in assuming if I run the live-cd and have no issues that the upgrade will work?
00:04	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, do that now...
00:04	<maco>	RyanPrior: given my hardware, id take that bet
00:04	<Saladin>	I am unable, for some reason, to install any extensions.
00:04	<tcpdumpgod>	set your ip to 192.168.0.101
00:04	<barslow>	RyanPrior: same question
00:04	<RyanPrior>	matt____: If you can get a hold of Amaranth, he/she tends to know a lot about graphics card issues as well.
00:04	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, i have tried a manual set up through gnomes network manager and through /etc/network/interfaces and it still doesnt work
00:04	<tcpdumpgod>	netmask: 255.255.255.0
00:04	<Saladin>	Sorry for being a pain - first upgrade.
00:04	<tanath>	barslow, that should be the case, though i've seen the livecd not work, and the install work...
00:04	<Cpudan80>	Anyone know why I can't play 2 sounds at the same time?
00:04	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, check your PMs
00:04	<maco>	barslow: im using my compiz settings from feisty
00:04	<Saladin>	And I mean, extensions in Firefox.
00:04	<ubuntuROX>	make sure that FF3 is completely shut down before starting ff2
00:04	<maco>	barslow: it works fine
00:04	<matt____>	RyanPrior: ok, thanks
00:04	<barslow>	tanath: interesting
00:04	<ng01>	saladin.  ur such a pain... :)
00:04	<romulo>	hi, i installed the fglrx driver on ati but fgl_glxgears is not working and 3d apps are generally slow (like q3 in this super machine), can anyone hlelp me?
00:04	<dragao-azul>	if i install ubuntu is there any "easy" way to get my ATI HD2900Pro card working with all the graphics effects?
00:05	<x1250>	Cpudan80: upgrading from gutsy?
00:05	<Cpudan80>	like ehh if I am using rhythmbox and xchat at the same time - and I get pinged in xchat, I wont hear the ping
00:05	<Cpudan80>	x1250: Yeah - just did
00:05	<ubuntuROX>	Saladin,, make sure FF3 is completely shut down before starting FF2
00:05	<ben-g>	i enabled my wireless in restricted drivers. Why won't it work?
00:05	<tanath>	barslow, there can be issues running of a disc. it's slower for one
00:05	<RyanPrior>	barslow: No, the LiveCD is not proof positive that the upgrade will work. The upgrade is affected by all the changes and customizations you make, so some of those may be messed with and you'll have to reconfigure things the way you want them.
00:05	<matt____>	Amaranth: hey buddy...after trying the 8.04 live cd (kubuntu and ubuntu), neither boots, both take me to a busybox, could this be a graphics issue?
00:05	<igormorgado>	is there any kernel difference between server/desktop  editions?
00:05	<x1250>	Cpudan80: try installing pulseaudio
00:05	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, check your private messages
00:05	<mad_max02>	Would it be smart to go for update to hardy or is a clean install better choice ???
00:05	<maco>	romulo: are you using fglrx on a card that is so old its not supported with taght driver? thats the symptoms i saw when opensuse tried to use that driver on a radeon 9250
00:05	<barslow>	I'm real nervous about upgrading
00:05	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, I cant reply as im not registered - let me register
00:05	<ubuntuROX>	otherwise you are still actually running FF3,, same thing happens the other way.
00:05	<tanath>	dragao-azul, run 'gksu displayconfig-gtk'
00:05	<igormorgado>	omg.. the chanel is very busy today, more than usual =D
00:05	<matt____>	mad_max02: i alwaws clean install. the only time i tried updating, it didn't work right :(*
00:05	<x1250>	Cpudan80: then configure pulseaudio to be used in system->prefs->sound
00:05	<romulo>	maco, my card is supported, its an x600 mobility
00:05	<barslow>	i finally have ubuntu exactly how i like it
00:05	<tcpdumpgod>	okay glaxo
00:06	<Cpudan80>	x1250: I'll give it a shot - thanks
00:06	<dragao-azul>	tanath, after that will it work fine? i don't have to do anything else?
00:06	<Fishscene>	Conventional wisdom dictates that clean installs are always better (and cleaner) than upgrades
00:06	<ubuntuROX>	my ubuntu is so how I like it its booring now :)
00:06	<RyanPrior>	barslow: If you have it exactly how you want it, no pressure to upgrade! It's still supported for many months.
00:06	<gnuskoo1>	barslow: go on, it'll be alright, or fun sorting it out
00:06	<igormorgado>	is there any kernel difference between server/desktop  editions?
00:06	<tanath>	dragao-azul, to configure X right. then run 'glxinfo | grep -i direct' to check for direct rendering
00:06	<mad_max02>	matt____, thanks dude. I'll dl the 64 bit ver and install it tomorrow.
00:06	<iDano84>	ok, I got Ubuntu discs in the mail today. I'm the first to admit, I know little to know little to nothing about linux. When I pop in the disc (v 7.10 x64) I select install Ubuntu, and then loss of video input. I Have no idea where to start?
00:06	<RyanPrior>	barslow: If it's perfect right now, then it's only downhill from here, right?
00:06	<RyanPrior>	igormorgado: Nope, same kernel.
00:06	<teo->	i need some help.. when i try to start ubuntu it doesn't start.. some busybox shell is started please help ?:S
=== glaxo is now known as glaxo1
00:06	<igormorgado>	RyanPrior: thank you
00:06	<tanath>	dragao-azul, there's a 'test' button to make sure you have it configured right, but after that, it should be good
00:06	<RyanPrior>	igormorgado: Same kernel, same packages, same tool chain, etc.
00:06	<pale-yafa>	guys, I have no firebug any more, cant work like that, why this is not mentioned?
00:07	<Saladin>	Yeah, I made sure FF3 was shut down, but still no success in installing extensions
00:07	<RyanPrior>	pale-yafa: Firebug works.
00:07	<gnuskoo1>	igormorgado: no, server has no desktop only
00:07	<dragao-azul>	tanath, ok, thz i'm going to try that
00:07	<tanath>	Saladin, still having trouble with extensions? did you try that extension i mentioned?
00:07	<ubuntuROX>	wierd,, you went to terminal and ran ps ax|grep firefox
00:07	<maco>	pale-yafa: firebug 1.2
00:07	<barslow>	RyanPrior: agreed
00:07	<pretender>	koverartist I cant select case in ubntu.  Any Ideas
00:07	<pale-yafa>	RyanPrior: its not, I upgraded to 8.4 and its telling me  its not compitable
00:07	<Saladin>	Sorry tanath, I missed what you said.
00:07	<james_>	how long would the online update to 8.04 take?
00:07	<maco>	pale-yafa: firebug 1.2
00:07	<Dason>	So..... what do I do if I can't download and install 8.04 if it won't work through the 'recommended' way?
00:08	<tanath>	Saladin, no you didn't
00:08	<joh6nn>	i'm not quite sure how to explain this properly, but whenever i use screen, apps like vim, that do their own paging, don't clear the screen properly.  i'm fairly certain that i just need to tell screen to pretend it's a different terminal, but i don't know which terminal to tell it to be.  anyone have ideas?
00:08	<barslow>	i think i'll wait untill there are a couple updates to 8.04 b4 taking the plunge
00:08	<maco>	pale-yafa: you need to update your firebug
00:08	<ubuntuROX>	just to make absolutely sure it was shut down?
00:08	<tanath>	Saladin, was a while ago. you acknowledged it
00:08	<dee_cz>	hi, im running the memtest from ubuntu cd, how long should it take?
00:08	<igormorgado>	gnuskoo1: thank you too =D
00:08	<cygoku>	Using Hardy Heron RC here ... Are the repos down ??
00:08	<maco>	cygoku: of course
00:08	<tanath>	Saladin, nightly tester tools extension
00:08	<ubuntuROX>	yes,, but cygoku did you update recently?
00:08	<gnuskoo1>	i got thinkpad r51 and gnome is really sluggish on xfce, any hints? intel 82528 graphics card
00:08	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: It will take forever, literally. It keeps running until you tell it to stop.
00:08	<cygoku>	Maco : "of course" ??
00:08	<barslow>	ryanprior: can you choose to install8.04 without Firefox beta3
00:08	<maco>	cygoku: its release day for a very popular distro.  what makes you think they could survive that?
00:08	<Fishscene>	All Servers for Hardy Heron are bogged down at the moment and likely will be for at least another day.
00:08	<Dason>	what do I do if I can't download and install 8.04 if it won't work through the 'recommended' way?
00:08	<teo->	i need some help.. when i try to start ubuntu it doesn't start.. some busybox shell is started please help ?:S
00:08	<Flannel>	igormorgado, RyanPrior: There are kernel differences.  They have different hardware support (non-server is more likely to support 'regular' obscure hardware), and server has PREEMPT turned off, among other changes.  Of course, you can run a server kernel on the desktop, or a generic kernel on a server.
00:08	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: The longer it runs without errors, the more sure you are that you don't have faulty memory. :-)
00:08	<tanath>	Saladin, makes firefox think your extensions are compatible. but i recommend enabling them one at a time
00:09	<matt____>	Amaranth: hey buddy...after trying the 8.04 live cd (kubuntu and ubuntu), neither boots, both take me to a busybox, could this be a graphics issue?
00:09	<maco>	cygoku: this happened last time too.
00:09	<dee_cz>	RyanPrior: do you know what is the 'safe' margin? how long should it run so that i can say it probably isnt the memory?
00:09	<RyanPrior>	barslow: Nope, distro upgrades are all-or-nothing affairs pretty much.
00:09	<tanath>	Saladin, 'cause some will work, and some won't, and some may prevent it from running
00:09	<ubuntuROX>	michael If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo grub-update to fix that.
=== Dana1 is now known as DanaG
00:09	<cygoku>	I think they can survive that because nothing should affect the linux image
00:09	<Dason>	what are other methods of installing 8.04?
00:09	<ubuntuROX>	cygoku If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo grub-update to fix that.
00:09	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: If you're seriously suspicious about your memory, I'd run it for a few hours to get your memory really hot and loaded.
00:09	<igormorgado>	Flannel: I wish to know if desktop one has virtualization support.
00:09	<maco>	cygoku: last time the entire ubuntu.com was taken down and replaced with a plain white background, black text "welcome to ubuntu.com here's a list of download links:" page
00:09	<gnuskoo1>	teo-: what messages you getting?
00:09	<cwillu>	pale-yafa, this is kinda scary:  you need to use firebug, but you can't be bothered to check getfirebug.com, where it lists a version of firebug that works with ff3? ;p
00:09	<DBautell>	dason, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. To mount the ISO you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
00:09	<tmccrary>	So.... Hardy breaks eclipse
00:09	<tanath>	Saladin, if you end up enabling a bad one that prevents it from running, then run an older firefox to fix it
00:09	<tmccrary>	Fantastic
00:10	<tanath>	Saladin, (ie., disable that extension)
00:10	<DBautell>	Dason, or did you mean a fresh install?
00:10	<maco>	Dason: whats the recommended way that you cant do?
00:10	<dee_cz>	RyanPrior: its that xp is turning sound from the card into a squeal and gives a bsod every other day, with no specific error... but the 8.04 runs fine :/
00:10	<Saladin>	Well, strangely enough, tanath, that extension installed okay.
00:10	<RyanPrior>	tmccrary: Eclipse is not well supported on Ubuntu. However, I downloaded the latest Eclipse and run it from my /home folder, and it runs fine.
00:10	<Dason>	the update manager
00:10	<Saladin>	Whereas all others aren't.
00:10	<tanath>	Saladin, the nightly tester tools? of course ;)
00:10	<jrabbit>	ok
00:10	<tmccrary>	RyanPrior: Thanks for the tip. It ran great with Gutsy....
00:10	<Fishscene>	My hats off to Hardy Heron! Built in VMware support? How cool is that?
00:10	<Dason>	I don't want a fresh install
00:10	<jrabbit>	It errored for the third time
00:10	<teo->	gnuskoo1 i don't get anything i am just putted in the busybox shell
00:11	<pale-yafa>	cwillu: how would I know thats its there? I just got a message that firefox beta does not support firebug, maybe it should say THIS VIRSION of firebug
00:11	<rich_freecomm>	heh, never download the desktop iso and the aleternate iso then try to update manager the new release.....it's gonna take me awhile :)
00:11	<DirkGently>	hey Fujitsu: tested Kubuntu on my laptop... the bcm43xx works fine... the PC even picks up my wireless router now without manual config... it was worth waiting a day :)
00:11	<maco>	Dason: whats the way that you cant install? we cant recommend alternatives without knowing what it was
00:11	<jrabbit>	[477.497091] Buffer I/O error on device sr0 Logic lock 169346
00:11	<dryrot>	does xen actually work in hardy ?
00:11	<Dason>	When I use apt-get and the default method of upgrading, it tells me that it can't connect to the server and to check my connection even though it's fine
00:11	<jrabbit>	Repeats
00:11	<RyanPrior>	pale-yafa: That's true. A better error message would be helpful.
00:11	<jrabbit>	then a SQUASHFS error
00:11	<pale-yafa>	anyway, if any body interested: Samba broke while upgrading
00:11	<maco>	Dason: oh...wait 2 days
00:11	<Killeroid>	Dason: too many people upgrading right now, servers hammered
00:11	<ubuntuROX>	Dason,, all the servers are bogged down with users
00:12	<Dason>	Oh that's sensible
00:12	<Dason>	No alternate repo's?
00:12	<RyanPrior>	Dason: Or, download the alternate CD via BitTorrent, burn it and put it in, and upgrade off of there.
00:12	<gnuskoo1>	do they release server download stats?
00:12	<maco>	Dason: theyre all pounded too :P
00:12	<Some_Person>	Why are there no updates available for my hardy-rc?
00:12	<Dason>	I have the cd
00:12	<tanath>	Saladin, a 'nightly' is a cutting edge build, released every day. it's an extension designed to enable extensions for testing on versions of firefox they aren't designed for
00:12	<oddalot>	hi can someone help me setting up my monitor with xorg.conf i can only get 640x480 and i had it working fine in 7.10
00:12	<maco>	Dason: you can upgrade from an alternate cd
00:12	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo update-grub to fix that.
00:12	<CyberCod>	can someone tell me the md5sum for Hardy Desktop iso?  just burnt a fresh copy and it is bunk
00:12	<maco>	Dason: and there actually is a way to make it search for faster/working repos
00:13	<tanath>	Dason,  go to System >	Admin >	Software Sources >	Download from other... >	Select best server
00:13	<c0mp13371331337_>	Help!  I started my dist-upgrade from work via SSH and miscalculated how long it would take!  I now have to leave work (and close the SSH connection).  If I send the apt-get process to the background, can I bring it to the foreground in a terminal window at home?
00:13	<cwillu>	Some_Person, the rc became the r
00:13	<thebigham>	What program can i use for ubuntu to display cpu temperture?
00:13	<maco>	Dason: but um...ask someone who uses a GUI how to do it, not me
00:13	<Dason>	Bittorrent was killer fast. so.. what's the command to use while in the cd?
00:13	<pale-yafa>	also: image with transparent backgrounds are having frames, which was not the case with Gutsy
00:13	<maco>	Dason: what tanath said
00:13	<Some_Person>	cwillu: with no changes?
00:13	<Mike>	Live CD only running at 800x600 on NV5700 card - any ideas...?
00:13	<marx2k>	So upgrading from ISO can only be done from the alternate install CD?
00:13	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo update-grub to fix that.
00:13	<RyanPrior>	Some_Person: the RC and the final release are the same thing, unless the RC has major errors that get fixed.
00:13	<jrabbit>	tanath: Buffer I/O error on device sr0
00:13	<[T]-Rex>	anyone from sydney?
00:13	<cwillu>	c0mp13371331337_, you're not in the best state
=== SamSamSam is now known as JPSmon
00:13	<twinkie_addict>	i'm looking forward to trying hardy . i'm installing via wubi
00:13	<jjt001>	how do i block a webpage in ubuntu?
00:13	<maco>	marx2k: yes
00:13	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person did you see that?
00:13	<JPSmon>	this is madeness!!
00:13	<Flannel>	marx2k: That's correct (or the DVD)), the desktop CD doesn't support upgrades (except for reinstall)
00:13	<cwillu>	c0mp13371331337_, ideally, having started it in a screen session, you'd be fine
00:13	<maco>	jjt001: parental-control-style?
00:13	<marx2k>	oh well
00:13	<Some_Person>	ubuntuROX: yes, XChat highlighted it red
00:13	<jjt001>	maco: yeah
00:13	<robeph>	anyone familiar with automount/autofs?
00:13	<cwillu>	c0mp13371331337_, is it still downloading, or actually installing now?
00:13	<maco>	dansguardian
00:13	<tanath>	jrabbit, o.O
00:14	<Some_Person>	ubuntuROX: what does update-grub do?
00:14	<Dason>	That's what I was looking for, thanks tanath
00:14	<jrabbit>	I serached on fourms
00:14	<jrabbit>	no dice
00:14	<c0mp13371331337_>	cwillu-  It's still downloading.
00:14	<tanath>	Dason, np
00:14	<maco>	Some_Person: rewrite your menu.lst based on the options set at the top of it
00:14	<mad_max02>	Where can I find full DVD of hardy for amd64 ???
00:14	<ubuntuROX>	it changes the label in your boot manager,, they forgot to do that
00:14	<tmccrary>	Man it would be so great to have an operating system that doesn't cause your apps to crash at random intervals
00:14	<c0mp13371331337_>	X-)
00:14	<tmccrary>	think of the possibilities
00:14	<mad_max02>	torrent would be nice
00:14	<Some_Person>	ubuntuROX: and i want that why?
00:14	<DBautell>	!torrents | mad_max02
00:14	<ubotu>	mad_max02: Hardy can be torrented from http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent or http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-server-amd64.iso.torrent depending on your architecture.

00:14	<cwillu>	c0mp13371331337_, I think you'll be okay then;  you'll have to revert the changes to sources.list, but then you should be able to restart it (it'll reuse the packages it downloaded)
00:14	<jjt001>	maco: do you know how to block sites?
00:15	<robeph>	can't i just update my beta hardy to release ;) heh
00:15	<jrabbit>	can any one help me?
00:15	<tmccrary>	!offtopic | flyingspaghettimonster
00:15	<CyberCod>	anyone?  can anyone tell me the md5sum of the 8.04 desktop cd?   I need to know if it is my hardware that is malfunctioning or a bad disc
00:15	<ubuntuROX>	because you are already on the stable version, they just forgot to update the label where it says development version.
00:15	<ubotu>	flyingspaghettimonster: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
00:15	<mad_max02>	maco, thanks dude
00:15	<jrabbit>	I'm serriously never using ubuntu again after all this install bullshit
00:15	<c0mp13371331337_>	cwillu - So I'm okay to just flat out stop the process?
00:15	<cwillu>	robeph, where you up to date leading up to the release?

00:15	<IndyGunFreak>	jrabbit: whats the problem?
00:15	<redstelwerk>	hello folks, could anyone post the /etc/apt/sources.lst from hardy to a pastebin, mine turned into a mess and I want to clear it out. thanks!

00:15	<cwillu>	robeph, you're probably running the release then
00:15	<jjt001>	maco: thanks
00:15	<c0mp13371331337_>	cwillu - Thanks a ton, you're a lifesaver!
00:15	<Saladin>	Although, tanath, it is now showing all my extensions on this FF2, but none of them work, and I can't click on enable or anything for them. However, before I did the Hardy upgrade, they all worked fine.
00:15	<robeph>	cwillu: ah ok
00:15	<sileni>	guys i get CFLAG error when i try to "make" anyone know solution?
00:15	<IndyGunFreak>	lol
00:16	<mad_max02>	DBautell, what do you mean by that ???
00:16	<scizzo->	I have been seeding since the official announcement came out..... :S and its well hammering my network at the moment
00:16	<jrabbit>	IndyGunFreak: I can't get into any install enviorment avilible on the desktop CD
00:16	<maco>	sileni: dont use that CFLAG?
00:16	<cygoku>	I cannot believe repos are down ... Ppl would go mad insane and crazy if Microsoft Update would go down for even a second.
00:16	<sileni>	no
00:16	<DBautell>	mad_max02, 20-40k :(
00:16	<oddalot>	hi, my computer is gay, k thanks
00:16	<robeph>	so anyone familiar with autofs?
00:16	<ubuntuROX>	are you sure you are launching the FF2 version?
00:16	<maco>	jrabbit: bad burn?
00:16	<IndyGunFreak>	jrabbit: the live CD's don't work?
00:16	<jrabbit>	Not sure
00:16	<sileni>	maco, i try to make and it says that i do not know how to get past this
00:16	<nous>	hi, big problem : I just uprgaded to hardy and my graphic card is not recognised anymore (an Intel 945). What can I do ?
00:16	<arbrandes>	oddalot, rofl
00:16	<Saladin>	Yes, ubuntuROX
00:16	<sebastian>	Hi, I'm having some issues with "Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI". I tried using some guides for 7.10 that are supposed to work for 8.04, but it isn't found in iwconfig.
00:16	<jrabbit>	maco: I can't verify the disk.
00:16	<spork969>	what are some dreamweaver-esque programs out there? i need a full functioning website and i don't have the time to brush up on my HTML
00:16	<Dason>	System >	admin >	softy srces >	select best
00:16	<mad_max02>	DBautell, ah its ok. I got time :D I wasnt gonna install it until tomorrow anyways :D
00:16	<oddalot>	stupid monitor won't display right
00:16	<ubuntuROX>	hmm,, IM not sure then,, mine worked fine..
00:16	<maco>	oddalot: your computer fancies other computers of the same sex?
00:17	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Microsoft doesn't have everybody clamoring for upgrades to Vista. If they made something people wanted, maybe they would have a harder time keeping up with demand. :-)
00:17	<linkmaster03>	When will the repos be back up grr
00:17	<maco>	jrabbit: why not?
00:17	<nous>	hi, big problem : I just uprgaded to hardy and my graphic card is not recognised anymore (an Intel 945). What can I do ?
00:17	<ubuntuROX>	oddalot that wouldnt do it for you?
00:17	<tanath>	Saladin, i had a weird issue like that the first time i tried to use the nightly exension. try restarting it, and make sure you select an extension, then right click and 'make compatible'
00:17	<oddalot>	nah
00:17	<jrabbit>	maco: It causes errors on disk
00:17	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Besides, torrents are super super fast right now, and you can get all the packages via torrent.
00:17	<DBautell>	You're all set, then, mad_max02
00:17	<maco>	spork969: Nvu Kompozer
00:17	<kasper>	hey.. anyone care to help with some nvidia problems on hardy? - ive installed driver and it worked just afterwards. Its not working after a reboot.
00:17	<jrabbit>	I'll reburn and verify
00:17	<maco>	jrabbit: guess what that means?
00:17	<Dason>	Wish XP wasn't getting dropped in June.
00:17	<oddalot>	i had to go back to default, it's this stupid old monitor
00:17	<jrabbit>	maco: ?
00:17	<ubuntuROX>	could always try what I did, with the manual install as root
00:17	<cygoku>	Oh I can get packaged trough torrent ?
00:17	<the_darkside_986>	i'm having trouble since Hardy clean upgrade. Everything is extremely laggy and even mouse movement stutters and the startup time is unbelievably slow. Is there a command to fix that?
00:17	<cygoku>	Link ?
00:17	<DooMRunneR>	damn wlan issues i have enough for today
00:17	<DooMRunneR>	good night :)
00:17	<maco>	jrabbit: if it cant verify because of errors, that confirms that its a bad burn
00:17	<sean_>	Dason: Why? Now you have a reason to go to ubuntu exclusively
00:17	<jrabbit>	It mounts fine in OSX
00:17	<Dason>	thepriratebay.org
00:17	<SeaPhor>	Has anyone discovered if RTL8185 wlan chipset works in 8.04? please?
00:17	<Ian1>	would anyone here be willing to help me (noob) fix grub for my new ubuntu install?
00:17	<mad_max02>	DBautell, yeah. I thought of upgrading my gutsy but I'll go with clean install. I wanna resize / partition to 50gb. I made a mistake and made it 100gb first place :D
00:17	<oddalot>	anyone here running a crt?
00:17	<tanath>	Saladin, um, i thought you were trying to enable FF2 extensions for FF3?
00:18	<ariqs>	Same here, dason. XP is a good OS despite what all the haters say ;)
00:18	<cwillu>	cygoku, this is typical stuff (look at any other app that has massive demand on very particular days, (which means I'm not talking about automatically downloaded windows updates, which are throttled precisely to avoid those problems :p))
00:18	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Read the topic. Download the torrent for the Alternate CD.
00:18	<maco>	jrabbit: doesnt mean the data's not corrupt
00:18	<jrabbit>	iguess
00:18	<Killeroid>	redstelwerk: http://pastebin.ca/996448
00:18	<linkmaster03>	When will the repos be back up?
00:18	<nibsa1242b>	Quick question, is there a reason why a network upgrade is preferred to using the alternate disk?
00:18	<redstelwerk>	thanks Killeroid!
00:18	<maco>	linkmaster03: when people stop killing them
00:18	<sean_>	If I had hardy beta, do the regular updates just make it into the final version? or do I have to dist-upgrade?
00:18	<CyberCod>	OMFG  this is a mad house
00:18	<Flannel>	nibsa1242b: It's not really.
00:18	<Flare183>	Wheeler: See?
00:18	<jroes>	I don't think it's that the repos are down moreso than that people are rampaging them
00:18	<maco>	sean_: youre done
00:18	<Saladin>	No, tanath, I reverted back to FF2
00:18	<Flannel>	sean_: yeah, just regular daily updates
00:18	<Fishscene>	linkmaster03, probably in a day or 2 when things settle down
00:18	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Probably in a few days. In the meanwhile, I suggest downloading via BitTorrent. There are thousands of seeds, it's super fast!
00:18	<ubuntuROX>	cygoku why do you need to download it? if you were running RC and its updated, all you have to do is update your grub.
00:18	<cwillu>	nibsa1242b, network will update all the packages you have (aka, won't break things that depend on older versions)
00:19	<sean_>	maco, Flannel: Thanks. I wished it'd be more exciting but that works. :-)
00:19	<x1250>	linkmaster03: just use some mirror repos
00:19	<Ian1>	Anyone interested in helping me set up grub?
00:19	<Dason>	UNIX
00:19	<Dason>	sean yea I know. I'll eventually be with UBUNTU fully because Linux is what IT companies want to see expertise in
00:19	<linkmaster03>	Ryan, i'm just trying to get some synaptic packages =S
00:19	<DBautell>	mad_max02, you might split that one down the middle, and have two distros installed... Sort of what I'm doing, so I can try different things out
00:19	<Saladin>	But, now I have done that, because of no extensions working, all of them fail on FF2 now as well. I used apt-get to install 2.
00:19	<ubuntuROX>	really? linux is hot right now eh?
00:19	<Dason>	no waii man
00:19	<tanath>	Ian1, it should take care of itself..
00:19	<nibsa1242b>	cwillu: ok, so if I have lots of extra packages installed I should wait until the repos are back up and then upgrade?
00:19	<Ertyle>	!offtopic
00:19	<ubotu>	#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
00:19	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Yup, it'll be awhile until the repos aren't super-swamped.
00:19	<gnuskoo1>	Ian1: whats the prob
00:19	<ubuntuROX>	did you restart the pc Saladin ?
00:19	<mad_max02>	DBautell, I'm ok with ubuntu. I just need hdd space. I got over 2TB and its never enough.
00:19	<cwillu>	nibsa1242b, probably your best bet, yes
00:19	<linkmaster03>	jesus :(
00:19	<sean_>	I've been running Ubuntu exclusively for ~6 months today. :-)
00:19	<dredhammer>	hello i was using the beta version of hardy the last bit of upgrades to LTS came through and now i don't have nor can i enable the restricted nvidia drivers
00:19	<maco>	ubuntuROX: heck yeah!
00:20	<DBautell>	:D
00:20	<tanath>	nibsa1242b,  go to System >	Admin >	Software Sources >	Download from other... >	Select best server
00:20	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: You shouldn't rely on public repos if you need 100% uptime - you should set up your own mirror at some point.
00:20	<MachinTrucChose>	hi
00:20	<Dason>	way to go sean
00:20	<kasper>	hey.. anyone care to help with some nvidia problems on hardy? - ive installed driver and it worked just afterwards. Its not working after a reboot.
00:20	<maco>	ubuntuROX: best-paying sysadmin jobs are *always* for *nix and never for window
00:20	<spork969>	maco, whats the difference between nvu and kompozer?
00:20	<Saladin>	After the upgrade, or after installing FF2? Upgrade = yes. FF2 = no, ubuntuROX
00:20	<sp219-away>	Does anyone know why clipboard charing from windows to ubuntu does not work properly?
00:20	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: I've done that quite a few times, it gets stuck somewhere around 175/187
00:20	<eduardo>	how do i upgrade ubuntu from terminal?
00:20	<MachinTrucChose>	can someone tell me how to add a context menu (right-click menu) option in Nautilus so I can "open as root" or "run as root" ?
00:20	<maco>	spork969: one's the first word of the name and the other's the second?
00:20	<Dason>	has anyone tried Ubuntu Studio? is it any good yet?
00:20	<ubuntuROX>	it might be worth a try, mine just worked
00:20	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Technically the servers aren't down right now - it's just that they're serving tens of thousands of requests.
00:20	<jrabbit>	Donno its huuuuge dashua`_
00:20	<jrabbit>	** Dason
00:20	<linkmaster03>	ok
00:20	<Saladin>	And I have been using Ubuntu for six months as well
00:20	<spork969>	maco, looks to me theyre two programs
00:21	<Ian1>	gnuskoo1: Well I tried (and failed I suppose) to add an XP line to my list file for grub, and when I tried to boot to it, XP's loader seems to have supplanted grub so now it just goes to that failed boot when i start my computer
00:21	<dubby>	hey anyone, I need a very stable java jre and anycase i installed sun-java6 and I need the firefox plugin
00:21	<tanath>	Saladin, nightly tester tools alters the extensions compatibility. ff2 thinks they don't work anymore. you'll prolly have to reinstall them if you want to go back..
00:21	<ubuntuROX>	I have been using it for almost a year now
00:21	<maco>	spork969: its called Nvu Kompozer
00:21	<sp219-away>	Does anyone know why clipboard charing from windows to ubuntu does not work properly?
00:21	<Fishscene>	The servers are undergoing the equivelant of DDoS attack- except it's ALL legitimate traffic. :)
00:21	<tanath>	Saladin, you shouldn't lose settings though\
00:21	<Flannel>	MachinTrucChose: install the nautilus-gksu package
00:21	<spork969>	maco, k
00:21	<gnuskoo1>	MachinTrucChose: google nautilus scripts
00:21	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, weird. WFM
00:21	<Ian1>	i know how to reinstall grub in the terminal, but i'm not sure how to tell which drive to install it to
00:21	<MachinTrucChose>	thanks flan
00:21	<ubuntuROX>	ahh,, see theres your problem
00:21	<eduardo>	Question: How do i upgrade ubuntu from the terminal?
00:21	<cwillu>	sp219-away, please give it more than 30 seconds between repeats
00:21	<Saladin>	Although... It only took me three days to know I wasn't going back to Windows
00:21	<maco>	spork969: kompozer is the latest release of nvu
00:21	<Dason>	apt-get upgrade (sud)
00:21	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, you tried letting it go for a few mins?
00:21	<Dason>	sudo apt-get upgrade
00:21	<ubuntuROX>	at least I bet its your problem,, uninstall that nightly tools extention
00:21	<RyanPrior>	Eduardo, I don't suggest doing it today.
00:21	<ubutom>	Hi guys, I have a problem with my xserver, or with the "unbreakable" xserver, I think, can someone help me?
00:22	<Saladin>	tanath, however... Nightly isn't showing up on the extensions list.
00:22	<RyanPrior>	eduardo: The servers are totally swamped.
00:22	<spork969>	maco, gotcha
00:22	<eduardo>	RyanPrior: why is that?
00:22	<maco>	!ask | ubutom
00:22	<ubotu>	ubutom: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
00:22	<cygoku>	I thought the repos would be mirrored or something.
00:22	<eduardo>	RyanPrior: ohhh
00:22	<ubuntuROX>	go to FF3 it should be there
00:22	<maco>	eduardo: /me points at calendar
00:22	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: it just worked... doesn't seem to be a good server though... yeah earlier I let it go for about 10min the window just went blank
00:22	<tanath>	Saladin, huh... well i've never downgraded like that, so...
00:22	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: The repos are mirrored, all over the world. They are all swamped.
00:22	<ubuntuROX>	then un-install it
00:22	<SeaPhor>	Has anyone discovered if RTL8185 wlan chipset works in 8.04? please?
00:22	<cygoku>	wow
00:22	<Dason>	System >	Admin >	Softy Sources choose best
00:22	<ibleed>	i only have swap / and /home partitions.  what other possible partitions might i want and what might their sizes be ?
00:22	<maco>	cygoku: they are. there are hundreds of mirrors.  theyre pretty much all swamped.
00:22	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, hrm, i guess they're getting hammered worse than i thought
00:22	<Flannel>	eduardo: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades has instructions
00:22	<alienbrain>	I just tried Hardy Heron Installation LiveCD feature, my network is not working. I don't see my module. Should I hope for better after installation or this aspect won't change?
00:22	<cygoku>	That's crazy you know.
00:23	<maco>	alienbrain: wired or wireless?
00:23	<ere4si>	ibleed: a partition for / is handy
00:23	<alienbrain>	maco, wireless
00:23	<sean_>	I had compiz working fine in beta, but now I upgraded and whenever I go to "normal" or "extra" I lose all window decorations. Any ideas?
00:23	<maco>	alienbrain: do you have any wired connection available?
00:23	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Millions of Ubuntu users try to upgrade all at once; thus, we have craziness aplenty. :-)
00:23	<alienbrain>	maco, ipw3945 module
00:23	<Ertyle>	alienbrain: if it doesn't work on the live CD, then it doesn't work in the installation. out of the box, that is - it's entirely possible that you *can* get it to work!
00:23	<alienbrain>	maco, yep sure
00:23	<ibleed>	ere4si, yes i have swap, /, and /home.  i'm wondering what others are useful
00:23	<x1250>	alienbrain: it will probably won't work
00:23	<cygoku>	" millions " ????
00:23	<cwillu>	alienbrain, what chipset?
00:23	<Dason>	Now to get copywritten DVD's to work right.....
00:23	<ubutom>	Well, maco, everytime I start up ubuntu now it doesnt work, the xserver simply doesnt come up. i tried dpgk-reconfigure, I erased and replaced the xorg.conf, but no joy...
00:23	<alienbrain>	Ertyle, I see, it was working on Gutsy though, out of the box
00:23	<maco>	alienbrain: oh you have a 3945? the module is now called iwl3945. it works great for me
00:23	<MachinTrucChose>	first thing to do in every ubuntu install: disable the *!!@#$ motherboard beep
00:23	<ere4si>	ibleed: that is all really - unless it is a server
00:23	<nibsa1242b>	ibleed: /var ~4GB (or less) good for log files... you don't want to have some faulty device fill up your log files and make your system unbootable... and /boot ~500MB (should hopefully be enough)
00:23	<x1250>	alienbrain: but that doesn't mean you can't make it work...
00:23	<sandfisch>	is it possible to update the beta to full?
00:24	<alienbrain>	cwillu, Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG
00:24	<tanath>	sean_, try running 'compiz --replace' from a terminal, and see the output
00:24	<Flannel>	sandfisch: yes, just regular daily updates
00:24	<Dason>	Machin! Tell me now! I hate it!
00:24	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Yup, supposedly Ubuntu has about 10 million users, so if more than 10% try to upgrade, that's millions.
00:24	<Ertyle>	alienbrain: then file a bug
00:24	<sean_>	sandfisch: Just do regular updates and you're all set!
00:24	<Baughn>	MachinTrucChose: I've found that an axe does that very well
00:24	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: I think I'll just wait a few days to upgrade... no rush
00:24	<MachinTrucChose>	dason: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_disable_the_pc_speaker_(beep!)
00:24	<the_darkside_986>	Everything operation in hardy is laggy and slow, and the CPU fan keeps spinning. What do I type to fix this?
00:24	<tanath>	sean_, er, make that 'compiz --replace &'
00:24	<ibleed>	nibsa1242b, what about /opt ?  is that useful ?
00:24	<Mimi>	alienbrain:  you have a problem w/ 3945? It's been fixed...
00:24	<Ertyle>	sandfisch: just let it run its normal updates, and you'll have final
00:24	<cygoku>	Well I am impressed.
00:24	<gaucho>	My audio isn't working.. It was perfectly working about 5 minutes ago on gutsy. I have an Asus p5b motherboard. What can I do?
00:24]  * x1250 wants #ubuntu+1 back
00:24	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, thought you said it just worked?
00:24	<alienbrain>	x1250, I understand, but I'm trying to assess how much time I need to spend after upgrading :)
00:24	<maco>	RyanPrior: you only hit multiple millions when 20% try to upgrade
00:24	<ubutom>	atm i can only access the root repair console
00:24	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, meh
00:25	<x1250>	alienbrain: did it work on gutsy?
00:25	<phiqtion>	how can i install XMMS in HARDY? thx
00:25	<cwillu>	maco, as if 50% of the installed base isn't trying to upgrade though :p
00:25	<RyanPrior>	maco: I call 1.1 more than one million, thus millions. One and one tenth millions.
00:25	<maco>	crimsun: ping
00:25	<ubutom>	every attempt to start gdm fails, failsafe graphics seems to be broken
00:25	<maco>	cwillu: yeah...
00:25	<sean_>	tanath: I think I need to re-enable nvidia drivers, does that make sense?
00:25	<alienbrain>	Mimi, in Gutsy, I would see that ipw3945 module is automatically loaded. Now in Hardy, I don't see it. Even when I try to modprobe. It's not there
=== Mike is now known as Mike_T
00:25	<nibsa1242b>	ibleed: I don't know, never needed an /opt before but I'm just running it on a few computers for personal use
00:25	<cygoku>	Danson ??
00:25	<DBautell>	even ,75 is a multiple
00:25	<ubutom>	so, what should I do? Does someone have an idea?
00:25	<maco>	alienbrain: its not called that
00:25	<tanath>	sean_, ah. in that case displayconfig-gtk may help
00:25	<yeknom_traf>	which version of ubuntu would i want to install on an iMac with duocore processor?
00:25	<maco>	alienbrain: its called iwl3945
00:25	<cygoku>	I mean Dason ??
00:25	<maco>	alienbrain: theres a new driver
00:25	<alienbrain>	maco, aha, let me check please
00:25	<Baughn>	sean_: You need to reinstall the nvidia drivers every time you upgrade your kernel. Which a distribution upgrade does. Granted, it might be automatic normally, but apparently not now..
00:25	<Joelito>	Hi, I can't use livCD of ubuntu 8.04
00:25	<phiqtion>	how can i enable UNIVERSE and MULTIVERSE in HARDY?
00:25	<nibsa1242b>	alienbrain: check restricted drivers manager to see if you have to enable it in there
00:25	<Saladin>	Now, when I click on the launcher for FF3, it is FF2 that pops up. I am totally confused.
00:26	<Joelito>	and the md5sum is correct
00:26	<x1250>	alienbrain: you can always uninstall kernel metapackages (linux-image, linux-image-generic, linux-headers-generic, etc) and use them in hardy
00:26	<Mimi>	alienbrain:  (sorry if you've already said that, but I just joined the channel) .. and this is the realease, not the release candidate or beta? I have the same card as yours, and I installed hardy from livecd.. wireless worked there, and after install it worked too :/ sorry not sure how to help, thought it was fixed for all of us
00:26	<tanath>	phiqtion, System >	Admin >	Software Sources
00:26	<sean_>	Baughn: Jest because it's newly released?
00:26	<fdsjkalf>	is archive.ubuntu.com down?
00:26	<RyanPrior>	yeknom_traf: Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy Heron" is the hot item now. It's available via BitTorrent, but today is release day so non-BitTorrent servers are very slow and swamped.
00:26	<maco>	Joelito: do a cd check and be more specific, please
00:26	<Jorophose>	Hi, important advisor, I'm an idiot who tries too hard. If I upgrade from 6.06 to 8.04: How long will it take me to do that (do I have to download a full 700MB?), is there any chance of it bjorking my system? and can I do it at any time or only today before there's newer nightly builds?
00:26	<jjt001>	where is cgi-bin located in ubuntu?
00:26	<Mimi>	﻿/me asks :  is it possible to increase the DPI on gnome? ... I have 1200x800 but it seems like a simple window takes most of the screen :P
00:26	<alienbrain>	maco, I can see the driver is there
00:26	<Mike_T>	nv
00:26	<maco>	fdsjkalf: its a release day. how could it possibly stay up?
00:26	<x1250>	alienbrain: I meant: uninstall kernel metapackages, and upgrade to hardy. Then, as metapackages are not installed, then your kernel version will be preserved.
00:27	<nibsa1242b>	sean_: Baughn I think sometimes the necessary drivers take a few days after the dist upgrade to become available for the kernel version
00:27	<Baughn>	sean_: I don't actually know if it normally does, but if it does, then the reason it doesn't /now/ would be because it's a separate upgrade system that doesn't know about that detail
00:27	<alienbrain>	Mimi, sure, that gives me higher hopes! :)
00:27	<phiqtion>	tanath: they are selected already but i can't find XMMS in the sources?
00:27	<sean_>	tanath, oh, nevermind. I forgot that was on my laptop! It uses intel drivers which is correct. Do I need to install xgl?
00:27	<jjt001>	maco: is cgi-bin located in var/www?
00:27	<ubutom>	xserver dead, failsafe doesnt work, dpkg-reconfigure no joy, erasing xor.conf and replacing with old version no joy, any ideas?
00:27	<cwillu>	Mimi, prefrerences | appearance| fonts
00:27	<RyanPrior>	Mimi: System ->	Preferences ->	Screen Resolution
00:27	<nous>	how do I start the graphic card config wizard ?
00:27	<Baughn>	nibsa1242b: That's why there's a compile-from-source option
00:27	<maco>	jjt001: *shrug* i never figured out how to make apache go on my laptop
00:27	<nibsa1242b>	Baughn: mmm fun
00:27	<Joelito>	maco: Hi, When I put the CD in the cd-rom, the cd-rom stops reading during the ubuntu banner with progressbar, but only the cd-rom light keeps on.
00:27	<fdsjkalf>	maco, you assume i know its release day. anywho, cool. new releases are great
00:27	<alienbrain>	x1250, I see, but I can only install from the CD at the moment, not very good bandwidth :)
00:27	<Baughn>	nibsa1242b: "Trivial", you mean. Normally it takes no effort at all.
00:27	<sandfisch>	is it possible to update the beta to full?
00:27	<maco>	Joelito: does it get to the menu part?
00:27	<tanath>	phiqtion, odd. they're in mine. you might try xmms2 though.
00:27	<alienbrain>	So guys, thank you a lot. I will give it a chance! :)
00:27	<cwillu>	alienbrain, then wait for a day or two :p
00:27	<sean_>	sandfisch: Just do regular updates and you're all set!
00:28	<jjt001>	maco: i'm trying to install dansguardian, and i need the cgi-bin directory?
00:28	<tanath>	sean_, no, shouldn't need xgl. i don't anyway
00:28	<Joelito>	maco: yes
00:28	<RyanPrior>	sandfisch: It is certainly possible. Regular updates will do the trick 100%.
00:28	<Joelito>	maco: I choose language and keyboard language
00:28	<alienbrain>	cwillu, nah, I will just go ahead now, can't wait :D
00:28	<nibsa1242b>	sandfisch: in the past the beta/ RCs updated automatically with the regular updates
00:28	<maco>	fdsjkalf: see the topic? and the front page of ubuntu.com (if it's up?)? and the announcement on the forum? and the mailing lists? and every ubuntu blog on the planet?
00:28	<Dason>	joelito i had that same problem
00:28	<tanath>	nous, 'gksu displayconfig-gtk'
00:28	<bingofuel>	can anyone can help me installing ubuntu with a sata disc_
00:28	<x1250>	alienbrain: I think you can upgrade using just the cd... do you have gutsy installed?
00:28	<Dason>	burn another disk at a slower speed
00:28	<sandfisch>	thanks all
00:28	<alienbrain>	x1250, yep
00:28	<Joelito>	Dason: How do you fixed it?
00:28	<Mimi>	cwillu:  Oh, I missed the "Details" button, thanks! ... Mmm.. it shows me changes on demand... yay!
00:28	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: what is your problem?
00:28	<phiqtion>	tanath: servers are being hammered right?
00:28	<alienbrain>	maco, any idea how can I precisely tell what the problem is coming from?
00:28	<maco>	jjt001: oh.  i dont know.  itd involve apache webserver...id say ask the ubuntu christian edition people. they install it by default
00:28	<sean_>	tanath: I have a thinkpad T61 with integrated graphics. the i810 driver wasn't any better
00:29	<IntangibleLiquid>	hi, can anyone see me talking?
00:29	<Dason>	joelito -burn another disk at slower speed
00:29	<metanil>	hello
00:29	<maco>	Joelito: do a cd test
00:29	<cwillu>	x1250, alienbrain, you can update from cd, but any packages that are missing won't be updated, and may break in spectacular explosions with shock wave effect
00:29	<Starnestommy>	IntangibleLiquid: possibly
00:29	<Ertyle>	IntangibleLiquid: yes
00:29	<fdsjkalf>	maco, whether or not your assumption seems reasonable, it wasnt accurate
00:29	<plik>	IntangibleLiquid: no  ;)
00:29	<maco>	alienbrain: sudo iwlist scan
00:29	<metanil>	which is the default Them in Ubuntu 8.04???
00:29	<maco>	alienbrain: anything listed?
00:29	<jforman>	i just upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 on my i386 desktop, and now when i try to move a window by alt+drag, ubuntu thinks i want to resize the window. any ideas whats causing this?
00:29	<metanil>	which is the default Theme in Ubuntu 8.04???
00:29	<tanath>	phiqtion, yes...
00:29	<Sivik>	has anyone gotten the 3d drivers to work for the ati hd 2600 for ubuntu?
00:29	<tanath>	phiqtion, but you can use a mirror
00:29	<x1250>	cwillu: hah, it might, but not the base system
00:29	<Joelito>	maco: ok
00:29	<phiqtion>	tanath: which one
00:29	<Joelito>	Dason Slower speed?
00:29	<maco>	jforman: check keybindings in compiz?
00:29	<Dason>	ewww ati Nvidia works better but I bet someone has
00:29	<eternalis1>	okay i tried upgrading to 8.04 and then it told me i iddnt have enough space, now i do but i cant seem to get the upgrade to appear again
00:29	<bingofuel>	nibsa124b.  i-ve installed ubuntu but when start to boot grub tell me the 21 error :S
00:29	<SeaPhor>	Has anyone tested or tried the RTL8185 wlan chipset to work in 8.04?
00:29	<eternalis1>	is there a command i can enter?
00:30	<maco>	jforman: resize might be mapped to alt
00:30	<alienbrain>	cwillu, lol

00:30	<Dason>	joelito: when you burn the disk, pick instead of maximum, 18.2 or something for write speed
00:30	<jforman>	maco: happen to know which setting thats under? i definitely remember not having this key combo set in 7.10
00:30	<phiqtion>	tanath: thank you

00:31	<Dason>	Solved my problem in about 5 minutes
00:31	<Joelito>	Dason: Ok, lucky I have a few cd-r to spare :p
00:31	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b  i-ve installed ubuntu but when start to boot. grub tell me the 21 error :S

00:31	<ZarathustraDK>	Are the repositories bogged down or something? It takes like 3 minutes wait before I connect when applying changes in synaptic
00:31	<Dason>	Good
00:31	<Jack_Sparrow>	fyreofchaos13, servers are overwhelmed.. try again later
00:31	<Sivik>	ZarathustraDK: yes
00:31	<Starnestommy>	ZarathustraDK: yes
00:31	<maco>	ZarathustraDK: release day. yes. very very nearly dead
00:31	<joh6nn>	does anyone know how to make screen behave more like xterm, with regards to termcap/terminfo stuff?  when i use vim inside of screen, i occasionally get some weird behaviour
00:31	<tanath>	fyreofchaos13, at what point?
00:31	<Fishscene>	ZarathustraDK, please see the channel topic
00:31	<Baughn>	ZarathustraDK: Mm. Yes. There are about a million people trying the same.
00:31	<plik>	eternalis1: tried: sudo aptitude dist-upgrade  ?
00:31	<Baughn>	ZarathustraDK: Literally, so..
00:31	<JPSmon>	how can I loop my terminal to constantly output iwconfig ?
00:31	<alienbrain>	maco, literally? so maybe I could try to restart?
00:31	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b fresh install, and it-s windows over sda1, the first partition
00:31	<ZarathustraDK>	haha, and here I thought it was hardy's fault :)

00:31	<fyreofchaos13>	Hrm, alright, Jack.
00:31	<maco>	alienbrain: thats a freaky error.  google it?
00:31	<tanath>	fyreofchaos13, the servers are being hammered. you might try a mirror...
00:31	<eternalis1>	plik: didnt work
00:31	<cwillu>	ZarathustraDK, well, it is, in a sense
00:32	<alienbrain>	maco, sudo lshw is taking forever to come up with anything.
00:32	<alienbrain>	maco, ah, good idea :P
00:32	<anonusr>	if I update to 8.04 using the alternate cd, and my system can't access the servers because they are overloaded, does that mean that all my packages that were in universe or multiverse will stop working until the server becomes available again?

00:32	<JPSmon>	Starnestommy: as often as possible without bogging my system up

00:32	<maco>	anonusr: ones that dont need to update will be fine...others will probably still work and lack new features
00:32	<sean_>	Ubuntu should work on automatic update file sharing or something. Like automatic torrents or something
00:32	<JPSmon>	Starnestommy: say 10 times a second
00:32	<nomopofomo>	How can I delete saved passwords that keyring saves?

00:32	<Starnestommy>	JPSmon: while true; do iwconfig; done
00:32	<Baughn>	sean_: No real need, for something that happens twice a year
00:33	<IntangibleLiquid>	anyone helps me with partitioning?
00:33	<cwillu>	sean_, apt-torrent is in the universe, I think they're working on integrating it
00:33	<tanath>	sean_, security is an issue though
00:33	<x1250>	simonft2: nope.

00:33	<simonft2>	3 different answers
00:33	<maco>	goat|work: disable the internet repos
00:33	<simonft2>	im tring to make a program come up on start up
00:33	<cwillu>	tanath, security, not so much, more that bit-torrent doesn't have a good way to update parts of torrents
00:33	<goat|work>	maco, in gutsy's software sources?
00:33	<Roxer>	i have to say i freaking love Ubuntu, im totaly new to ubuntu. Tho i have used gentoo for 8 years
00:33	<sean_>	True on all accounts. It'd be a great feature if they figured out how to do it securely.

00:34	<maco>	eternalis1: still cant type
00:34	<cwillu>	!motd
00:34	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about motd - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
00:34	<hmuller>	Roxer: There are a few ex-gentoo users about
00:34	<Sivik>	Someone needs to put that all repositores are slow
00:34	<RyanPrior>	talntidwrk: Today is release day, so the servers and mirrors are super swamped.
00:34	<Baughn>	* talntidwrk
00:34	<Dason>	go to System >	Admin >	Software Sources >	Download from other... >	Select best server
00:34	<maco>	eternalis1: put a - before the c in the one with quotes
00:34	<joh6nn>	does anyone know how to make screen behave more like xterm, with regards to termcap/terminfo stuff?  when i use vim inside of screen, i occasionally get some weird behaviour
00:35	<Roxer>	Anyone have some cool way to play .img movies?
00:35	<tanath>	cwillu, yeah, that too. would need a modification of BT
00:35	<linkmaster03>	When I open xsane, this comes up, and the program immedietly exits: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
00:35	<alienbrain>	maco, I'm getting other freaky stuff in dmesg :). iwl3945: Microcode SW error detected. Resarting 0x82000008. And Another line.
00:35	<talntidwrk>	I knew today was release day, didn't know it was hosted on archive.*
00:35	<RyanPrior>	Sivik: It's in the channel topic!
00:35	<alienbrain>	Googling :)
00:35	<maco>	Cpudan80: hiding
00:35	<plik>	Sivik: it's in the topic
00:35	<grindhold>	simonft2 you can actually realize autostart programs on linux, but thats not as easy as in windows.. you have to scriüt
00:35	<maco>	Cpudan80: and totally useless anyway
00:35	<grindhold>	*script
00:35	<Sivik>	oh, so people just do not read
00:35	<sarkie>	Is there a way to upgrade 7.10 ->	8.04 using the CD?
00:35	<maco>	Cpudan80: screen resolution is in preferences
00:35	<nomopofomo>	maco, how would I change "allow always" to something else?
00:35	<talntidwrk>	/topic
00:35	<Dason>	I didn't even realize it was release day
00:35	<cwillu>	tanath, look at debtorrent
00:35	<plik>	same old story
00:35	<DBautell>	sarkie, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. To mount the ISO you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
00:35	<RyanPrior>	Sivik: Of course not. That's why we're here. :-)
00:35	<MachinTrucChose>	hey guys, I installed nautilus-gksu but I still don't have the option to "open as <user>" in the nautilus context menu
00:35	<Sivik>	RyanPrior: do you know anything about the hd 2600 ati drives for ubuntu?
00:36	<sarkie>	DBautell, Damn it, just downloaded the normal release!! :) meh
00:36	<Jack_Sparrow>	sarkie, only the alternate cd
00:36	<RyanPrior>	Sivik: No clue. I use whatever drive the Driver Manager installs. :-)
00:36	<DBautell>	sarkie :D
00:36	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b  no, i can-t use the PC, the menu of grub doesn-t appear
00:36	<talntidwrk>	damn. i'm fraid to reboot now.
00:36	<eternal_p>	MachinTrucChose: try doing a ctrl-alt-backspace to re-load gnome and try again
00:36	<altj>	Re: swamped servers; is there a way people can become a temporary mirrors to help out w/some of these high-traffic days?
00:36	<fyreofchaos13>	Yay, the server worked. Thank you! :D
00:36	<sarkie>	ah well, are the servers still overloaded?
00:36	<maco>	nomopofomo: choose "allow once"?
00:36	<MachinTrucChose>	eternal: I logged out then logged back on
00:36	<tanath>	cwillu, cool...
00:36	<Sivik>	RyanPrior: its so much easier just to use nvidia because of their support
00:36	<simonft2>	how would I make pidgin come up on startup?
00:36	<JPSmon>	Starnestommy: can I have it "press enter" a few time to get it to say in one spot?
00:36	<jrabbit>	sarkie: do bears shit in the forest?
00:36	<goat|work>	sarkie: for me yes
00:36	<Sivik>	sarkie: yes, its realese date
00:36	<RyanPrior>	altj: Yup, BitTorrent!
00:36	<Abd>	lol not even 1kb transfer speed
00:36	<Dason>	go to System >	Admin >	Software Sources >	Download from other... >	Select best server
00:37	<Sivik>	Abd: Release date, all repos are slow
00:37	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: try sudo xsane
00:37	<Fishscene>	abd, on bittorrent?
00:37	<Starnestommy>	JPSmon: while read; do iwconfig; donw
00:37	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: ok, obviously something went wrong with the installer configuring grub... it happens and is highly annoying. I can help you get XP back to a bootable state, however, I'm not enough of a grub wizard to guide you how to fix the problem and allow you to boot into XP or Ubuntu.
00:37	<RyanPrior>	altj: If Ubuntu switched to using Apt-Torrent by default I think things would be much better, but that's a different argument. :-)
00:37	<Starnestommy>	*done
00:37	<Jack_Sparrow>	simonft2, Did you see the link ubotu provided about startup
00:37	<metanil>	my touchpad is not working properly ( it clicks even if i am just moving around cursor) ... ubuntu 8.04 laptop ->	VAIO.
00:37	<sarkie>	Indeed, I'll just download the alternate CD and do it tomorrow off line ! ah well
00:37	<simonft2>	yes
00:37	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: that does the same thing
00:37	<tanath>	eternal_p, jeeze, is no one careful with that? better to suggest a logout. if you do that with unsaved work, it's just gone :-/
00:37	<simonft2>	oh
00:37	<maco>	nomopofomo: theres a keyring preferences thing in sys->pref too
00:37	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: k, hold on
00:37	<simonft2>	lol did't read far enough
00:37	<simonft2>	sorry
00:37	<Dason>	metam give them a week for the IRC to calm down a little (if at all)
00:37	<Jack_Sparrow>	np
00:37	<eternal_p>	tanath: true :)
00:38	<phiqtion>	tanath: i just installed XMMS2 on hardy but it doesn't show up in the MENU.
00:38	<biabia>	my tomboy notes wont open. i did a find / -iname tomboy and searched through the folders for any files that looked like they could be the ones i need but i couldnt find them
00:38	<alienbrain>	maco, Most probably: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=461924
00:38	<tanath>	phiqtion, well, alt+f2 & run it
00:38	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b i was thinking if i can-t install correctly grub, i going to reinstall windows xp, to recover one OS at lesat
00:38	<maco>	biabia: they shouldbe in .tomboy
00:38	<grindhold>	pulse audio sucks.. even rhythmbox doesn't work . anyone who fixed the problem?
00:38	<Dason>	Quick question, do we need to reinstall WINE when we reboot?
00:38	<Jack_Sparrow>	phiqtion, is xmm2 from our repos?
00:38	<jords>	omg is it just me or is archive.ubuntu.com completely hamered?
00:38	<tanath>	phiqtion, menu editor should see it, and let you put it there
00:38	<jroes>	does anyone know where I can find download statistics?
00:38	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: try "mv ~/.sane ~/.sane-old", and then running xsane ?
00:38	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: I can attempt to play grub wizard if you'd like... I just can't guarantee I can fix it.
00:38	<phiqtion>	Jack_Sparrow: yeap
00:38	<Dason>	jords: go to System >	Admin >	Software Sources >	Download from other... >	Select best server
00:38	<jroes>	like how many people downloaded ubuntu 7.10, 6.10, etc.
00:39	<Cpudan80>	jords: yes
00:39	<plik>	jords: everythings hammered
00:39	<Cpudan80>	jords: its tanked
00:39	<biabia>	maco thanks I'll look there. that one didnt come up in my search
00:39	<tanath>	jords,  go to System >	Admin >	Software Sources >	Download from other... >	Select best server
00:39	<jords>	Dason: How do you do that on ubuntu server?
00:39	<stoked>	how do I change the pagesize to use larger than 4k block sizes in XFS?
00:39	<Jack_Sparrow>	phiqtion, cool, I didnt know it was there.. try running from cli and make sure it comes up
00:39	<tanath>	heh
00:39	<jords>	My desktops been on 8.04 for ages
00:39	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: same thing
00:39	<Dason>	Oooh I only know Desktop
00:39	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: you don't have to reinstall XP; all you need is a win XP install disk, from the recovery console you can fix the MBR and you'll be ok
00:39	<talntidwrk>	tanath, can you tell me how to do that from command line?
00:39	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b what is grub wizard_
00:39	<tanath>	jords, it's in synaptic
00:39	<rich_freecomm>	"Fecthing file 1 of 1292" :D
00:39	<phiqtion>	Jack_Sparrow: how do i run CLI
00:39	<maco>	alienbrain: i give up. my laptop is magic.
00:39	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: someone who knows lots about grub
00:39	<Jack_Sparrow>	phiqtion, cli means a terminal
00:39	<talntidwrk>	I kinda killed my window manager and uninstalled it, thinking i could get another one from apt... :P
00:40	<|stefan|>	just upgraded to hardy. and all of a sudden when i log in with ssh i get posix instead of utf-8
00:40	<Dason>	Nice
00:40	<tanath>	talntidwrk, uh, there's an apt command for it, but i forget what it is... hold on
00:40	<alienbrain>	maco, thanks for the heads up :)
00:40	<|stefan|>	anyone can explain this ?
00:40	<biabia>	xfce is my favorite window manager
00:40	<phiqtion>	Jack_Sparrow: i typed xmms2 and just some commands popped up
00:40	<OzFalcon>	Will the new hardy install let me resize my fedora partition for dual boot?
00:40	<Dason>	Is a reinstallation of WINE required after upgrade?
00:40	<talntidwrk>	Dason, not if you don't want to run Windows apps ;)
00:40	<Dason>	Lol
00:40	<rich_freecomm>	"About 22 hours 33 minutes remaining" awesome
00:41	<talntidwrk>	but, i don't know ;)
00:41	<Dason>	It's more for the unpacking of them
00:41	<x1250>	Dason: it shouldn't be necessary
00:41	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: same thing
00:41	<DEstlund>	I'm having trouble installing Heron - had the same problem with the betas: it complains that every file does not match the one on the disk. My cd burner works fine with everything else, so do my hard drives. Anybody seen this?
00:41	<Dason>	For use in Windows
00:41	<burner>	OzFalcon: i assume it depends on the fedora partition type
00:41	<x1250>	doesn't work for you Dason?
00:41	<jPratt>	lol Well you knoe most things that are made are for Windows and well i like my Photoshop :P
00:41	<Datalanche>	Hi. I just tried to do a fresh install of Hardy on my computer. I have two drives and two optical drives on my motherboards IDE controller, and three more hard drives on my Silicon Image-based PCI-IDE card. It is detecting the Sil-card's drive first(hda, hdb, and hdc). After the install, all I get is a screen full of "﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ..." What can I do to fix this?
00:41	<Dason>	Crystal xp
00:41	<bingofuel>	je i was playing like a grub wizard but my magic is bad :p,
00:41	<bingofuel>	tell me your idea...if doesn-t work no problem
00:41	<OzFalcon>	burner, ext3
00:41	<Dason>	killled my dlls and I lost mah windows Cd
00:41	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: yep, looking to see what else i can turn up
00:41	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: cool thanks
00:42	<altj>	damn, I've been seeding kubuntu images all day and just started seeding ubuntu images.  There's a bit of a difference in demand :-)
00:42	<OzFalcon>	Can hardy resize ext3 partitions?
00:42	<maco>	Datalanche: did the install complete?
00:42	<Dason>	SOOOOO... I can't install anything without opening in WINE and moving to Windows
00:42	<Fishscene>	lol altj
00:42	<Datalanche>	maco: Yes, finished fine and I clicked restart.
00:42	<jPratt>	Course we all know regular Ubuntu=Pwnage given by the Linux Gods
00:42	<ng0n>	o.. i got your notes here.. .sorry.
00:42	<sven_oostenbrink>	What exactly is the difference between 64 bits ubuntu and 32 (ignoring the obvious)? is 64 bits faster? could it cause problems with compatibility? will all (32 bits) programs work without problem on 64 bits?
00:42	<sean_>	tanath: I have integrated intel graphics and compiz isn't working. I'm using the "intel" driver. Any ideas?
00:42	<Datalanche>	maco: In Gutsy, my onboard IDE drives were hda and hdb. Now they are all sdX
00:42	<dmg46664>	I have downloaded the hardy CD for safe keeping in case of new installations, but I want to merge the packages on it with our local apt-cache, so local machines can all upgrade without all downloading 9 hours worth of packages each. Where can I find docs on how to do that?
00:42	<FrankH>	hi. what is the new package name for vim-full?
00:42	<ryanpg>	yay! Hardy Heron! Boo! my canon camera still doesn't automount - anyone have tips on getting this feature back? It was in the early betas...
00:43	<derspankster>	installed Hardy Server on a box I put together and I am totally lost
00:43	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: you on gutsy or hardy?
00:43	<Datalanche>	whereas before just the ones on the sil card were sdX
00:43	<maco>	Datalanche: thats normal.thats a libata change
00:43	<Dason>	(shell32 was moved with some UI in Windows modifications)
00:43	<erat123>	ubuntu 8.04 comes w/ a browser in beta?!!?  what's the deal???
00:43	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: gutsy
00:43	<tanath>	sean_, did you use displayconfig-gtk to try different drivers?
00:43	<maco>	Datalanche: are any of the drives reporting themselves wrong to the bios?
00:43	<Jack_Sparrow>	!aptoncd >	dmg46664
00:43	<biabia>	maco yay ! the notes are there. thanks
00:43	<maco>	Datalanche: i know there are issues with sata drives that tell the bios to pretende they're IDE
00:43	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: I tink I might have something for you to help... hold on a min
00:43	<x1250>	erat123: firefox3 should be there
00:43	<sean_>	tanath, unfortunately. :-\ I also checked my graphics card and it says intel should be the one
00:43	<Mike_T>	HowTO : Get better than 800x600 in vn 5700 using live cd - no xorg options on boot?
00:43	<tanath>	sean_, test different drivers and after each working one, run 'glxinfo | grep -i direct' to see if direct rendering is enabled
00:43	<Datalanche>	maco: Nope, I watched them all pop up, they seem to be going in just fine. Oh, and also, they are IDE drives, not SATA
00:43	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b ok
00:43	<Jack_Sparrow>	maco, I am running on sata pretending to be ide here
00:44	<tanath>	sean_, i dunno. might try google & ubuntu forums
00:44	<zado>	firefox 3 beta 5 is good enough for release
00:44	<ng0n>	is the new Ver out.  I got Gusty
00:44	<jPratt>	Yes it is
00:44	<maco>	Datalanche: theyre *all* IDE? all more than 5?
00:44	<Dason>	Mike T restricted drivers in System >	admin
00:44	<sean_>	tanath: is there any way to add displayconfig-gtk to my main menu? It used to be in admin
00:44	<erat123>	x﻿1250: god i hope i didnt get the wrong version...
00:44	<eternalis1>	maco i got some error
00:44	<fdsjkalf>	is it true that ff3 uses an ugly bold font for the URL
00:44	<ng0n>	hmmm. ok.
00:44	<Datalanche>	maco: Yes, I have five IDE hard drives.
00:44	<eternalis1>	maco: it says i have to check my internet connection, but im connected so wtf?
00:44	<tom_>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.
00:44	<jPratt>	ng0n yes hardy is out
00:44	<Dason>	wow, there's the background update!
00:44	<fdsjkalf>	thats reason enough to not use it
00:44	<rich_freecomm>	Greetings Scunizi
00:44	<erat123>	so, does firefox beta come w/ hardy or the finished release?
00:44	<maco>	Jack_Sparrow: the problem is when you have lots of IDE and it gets confusing when the OS sees lots of IDE due to that bios setting
00:44	<tanath>	sean_, menu editor?
00:44	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink: I highly recommend 32 bit. Not everything works out of the box with 64 bit that does with 32 bit. And there should be 5% or less performance difference between the two unless you are running a machine with >4GB of RAM.
00:44	<ng0n>	Hardy.  I like the sound of that.
00:44	<maco>	Datalanche: you cant do that
00:44	<Jack_Sparrow>	eternalis1, Please do not use that shorthand..
=== tom_ is now known as fluidd
00:44	<noodles12>	firefox beta 5
00:44	<Dason>	erat, the finish for F3 isn't out yet
00:45	<eternalis1>	Jack_Sparrow: do you have a solution, or are you going to sass me?
00:45	<maco>	Datalanche: i dont know how else to explain it but...5 IDEs just cant go
00:45	<sean_>	tanath: nevermind. I'm blind. :)
00:45	<tanath>	XD
00:45	<maco>	Datalanche: its a bug
00:45	<Datalanche>	maco: Uh, yeah I can. I have two connect on the motherboard's IDE controller, and three on a PCI expansion card.
00:45	<OzFalcon>	erat123, Beta5, But you can download prev stable release if you want.
00:45	<Datalanche>	oh, really
00:45	<ng0n>	flash, sass and white trash : welcome to #ubuntu !
00:45	<x1250>	ff3 is ok, but it doesn't use pulseaudio. That feature was pushed to ibex, instead.
00:45	<DEstlund>	anybody seen persistent CRC errors on hardy install from cd?
00:45	<goat|work>	Jack_Sparrow: was banned?
00:45	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b you-re saying that i have to install the 32 bits version_
00:45	<erat123>	that's too bad.    when i go to ubuntuguides.org, my X session logs off under firefox beta5....   i might have to downgrade firefox
00:45	<maco>	Datalanche: on ubuntu, 5 IDEs just cant go
00:45	<Mike_T>	Dason: None listed...:-(
00:45	<goat|work>	sorry, nvm
00:45	<Datalanche>	maco: It was working just fine in Gutsy
00:45	<erat123>	i sent in a bug report, but didnt hear back
00:45	<Dason>	hmm...
00:45	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: check and see if there's an update available for libgtk2; a couple of people reported that as fixing the problem for them
00:46	<joh6nn>	does anyone know how to make screen behave more like xterm, with regards to termcap/terminfo stuff?  when i use vim inside of screen, i occasionally get some weird behaviour
00:46	<IntangibleLiquid>	fdsik -l /dev/sda says cannott open /dev/sda: what should I do?
00:46	<maco>	Datalanche: regression....its a known bug on hardy though
00:46	<tanath>	talntidwrk, found it: netselect-apt
00:46	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: that was for someone else... there is nothing wrong with 64 bit version, however, most people I know and myself prefer the 32 bit version for ease of use
00:46	<Dason>	intang - Are you using Sudo?
00:46	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: libgtk2 is the name on repos?
00:46	<OzFalcon>	Too much noise....
00:46	<ng0n>	64 bit.  drivers ?
00:46	<Datalanche>	I don't understand.
00:46	<Datalanche>	it was never a problem before
00:46	<jvai_>	no straight upgrade from dapper to hardy in 09'?
00:47	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: anyhow... http://www.supergrubdisk.org/ should help you boot
00:47]  * DBautell has no problem with 64
00:47	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: not sure, the posts don't say for sure
00:47	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: you should be able to go from Dapper to Hardy
00:47	<Dason>	IntangibleLiquid are you using sudo fdisk ?
00:47	<ng0n>	i'm too nube to 64
00:47	<capo>	so the repo's are all still down?
00:47	<tanath>	gah, aptitude wants to autoremove all my xmm2 plugins. why?!
00:47	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: thanks i found it, installing now
00:47	<IntangibleLiquid>	﻿Dason: no, but thanks, it shows the partitions
00:47	<jvai_>	aaw "CLAPPIN"...  ty IndyGunFreak
00:47	<Jorophose>	IndyGunFreak: Would you just follow the same procedure then? (update-manager -d)
00:47	<phiqtion>	XMMS2 has no GUI? is there a starter guide for HARDY?
00:47	<Gman99999>	has the downloading of the upgrade stopped for anyone else?  is the server possibly down?
00:48	<tanath>	phiqtion, audacious is very similar to xmms
00:48	<capo>	yeah i think the repo's are down
00:48	<DBautell>	the only thing I remember having to fiddle with was getting the 32 bit firefox
00:48	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: Jorophose i never done it, but i'm almost 100% certain, you can go from 1 LTS version, to another LTS version, w/o loading up the versions in between
00:48	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: you'll need to download the CDROM or USB version
00:48	<capo>	i can't download any packages
00:48	<Gman99999>	ah wait here we go
00:48	<x1250>	Gman99999: just pick a mirror
00:48	<joh6nn>	Gman99999: the repos are choked
00:48	<IntangibleLiquid>	﻿Dason: the sad thing is, Partition Editor says my current harddisk space is unallocated
00:48	<DBautell>	for flash, etc
00:48	<blbrown>	im back, I got the 8.04 iso CD download, but I dont see any cdromupgrade.  is there somewhere I should look for that
00:48	<tanath>	capo, there's plenty of mirrors
00:48	<ng0n>	my Vista found out i was doing Ubuntu and I swear, it has straighted up a little.  is that possible ?
00:48	<Dason>	Gman999999                          System - Admin Softy Sources - Alternative sources - scan for best
00:48	<maco>	Datalanche: and in hardy it is a problem.  things changed and it got broken.  thats all there is to it
00:48	<jvai_>	IndyGunFreak,  it should hold reason from one LTS to another.. right?
00:48	<rich_freecomm>	mine is still puttin away.....of course it says I have about 48 days left
00:49	<dmg46664>	Jack Sparrow: Thanx for the link to aptoncd... however I think what I was looking for was apt-cache-import
00:49	<maco>	Datalanche: hopefully itll be fixed by 8.04.1 in june, but maybe it wont
00:49	<Jorophose>	IndyGunFreak: What are the odds of it going bang in my face?
00:49	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: one would think.. google it though, i'm almost 100% SURE OF IT.
00:49	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: they are the latest versions
00:49	<jvai_>	'k
00:49	<Dason>	IntangibleLiquid I suggest using an external disk drive editor then
00:49	<joh6nn>	ng0n: yeah, but if that's what it takes to make Vista behave, is it worth keeping around?
00:49	<sven_oostenbrink>	nibsa1242b>	64bits is slower?
00:49	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: ; (
00:49	<IndyGunFreak>	Jorophose: don't really know, never done it.... try googling it... i install every 6mo
00:49	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink:  DBautell: yes, Firefox and extensions and Wine are the two main things that I find are easier to use in 32bit... one can always run the 32bit version on a 64 bit system but it takes time
00:49	<Dason>	Such as GParted
00:49	<tanath>	Jorophose, follow the guide in the topic and  you should be good
00:50	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink: I think 64bit is marginally faster... but it depends
00:50	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: did this used to work and suddenly broke, or did it never work?
00:50	<thedonvaughn>	ng0n: yah it's a feature.  If you install a linux kernel greater than 2.6.24, vista knows and it tweaks it's parameters (tm)]
00:50	<hansin>	ng0n: Yeah, I head there is a bit of code in Vista that detects if you are dool-booting Linux, and if so it runs better.  I guess MS must have figured if your dual boot Linux, that Vista better shape up in case you might make the full switch.
00:50	<Datalanche>	hmmmm
00:50	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: it worked yesterday
00:50	<Mike_T>	hansin: lol
00:50	<pifedo>	Hi! My sound isn't working.. I have an Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02), but alsa can't find any sound card. What can I do?
00:50	<Jack_Sparrow>	dmg46664, several options available
00:50	<Datalanche>	Well then, I dunno what to do if I can't use Hardy on my computer.
00:50	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: so what'd you do to break it between now and then? : )
00:50	<Light|DC>	t/hop
00:50	<ng0n>	hansin: I knew it !@!
00:51	<Gman99999>	is wine even a viable method for installing popular windows aps I sure hear alot of people preaching how much better linux is than windows but Ive had so much trouble with simple hardware drivers that pissed me off alot, what makes linux so good?
00:51	<jwwadk>	hello all. this may sound like a noobish problem: my screen brightness options have disappeared
00:51	<unop>	joh6nn, you might need 'altscreen on'
00:51	<blbrown>	sh: Can't open /media/cdrom0/cdromupgrade ... wtf
00:51	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: nothing xD
00:51	<tanath>	pifedo, hardy uses pulseaudio now...
00:51	<eternal_p>	Gman99999: go to www.winehq.com and look for the app in question
00:51	<Dason>	Gman, to be king, yes
00:51	<pifedo>	tanath: So, What can I do? My sound isn't working any way...
00:51	<hansin>	ng0n:
00:51	<joh6nn>	unop: just throw 'altscreen on' in my .screenrc ?
00:51	<maco>	Datalanche: stick to gutsy
00:51	<ng0n>	hah
00:51	<Myke516>	Hey everyone
00:51	<tanath>	hansin, o.O have a source for that?
00:51	<Dason>	How can we help
00:51	<Datalanche>	Too late
00:51	<Datalanche>	I just wiped it
00:52	<Gman99999>	are there lots of bugs still in hardy heron?
00:52	<jPratt>	whats LTS stand for
00:52	<Datalanche>	heh
00:52	<thedonvaughn>	Gman99999: it's not made for easy plug-n-play.. even tho ubuntu tries that.  Sometimes you gotta manually install or setup a driver if that company who makes that piece of hardware doesn't give a linux driver for free and or hardware calls to developers to include in kernel.
00:52	<DBautell>	nibsa1242b, sven_oostenbrink, I seem to remember the BOINC people saying the speed difference is negligible, and even sometimes negative. Never occured to me that that might be part of my wine diffculties
00:52	<SeaPhor>	Gman99999, you can send me a tell and if i know i'll discuss it with you
00:52	<Dason>	Long Term Service
00:52	<fdsjkalf>	im going to try hardy today, i may even continue to use it
00:52	<unop>	joh6nn, aye, yes .. but i'm just stabbing in the dark - what exactly is vim doing in screen?
00:52	<FrankH>	﻿what is the new package name for vim-full?
00:52	<hansin>	ng0n: I was just kidding with you.  I highly suspect it is not related, at least not intentionally so.  But that would be funny.
00:52	<pifedo>	Gman99999: Oh yes! A LOT OF!
00:52	<tanath>	pifedo, you could make sure you have all the pulseaudio stuff you need, and remove the alsa & other stuff
00:52	<jwwadk>	does anyone know how to manually change screen-brightness?
00:52	<phiqtion>	does anyone know how to run XMMS2 on hardy?
00:52	<tanath>	pifedo, seems to have worked for me
00:52	<ng0n>	hansin: ya, i get it.
00:52	<lewench>	!upgrade
00:52	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
00:52	<ng0n>	hey.. it was FUNNY
00:52	<Dason>	Screen Brightness is a Monitor setting
00:52	<unop>	phiqtion, xmms has been replaced by audacious
00:52	<tanath>	jPratt, long term support
00:52	<fdsjkalf>	i found a mirror thats serving hardy to me at 1150+ KBps
00:52	<hansin>	tanath: Yeah, isdualbootlinux?.dll.
00:52	<nibsa1242b>	Gman99999: I only use WINE to visit sites in IE that refuse to work with firefox, opera, or Konq. And that doesn't always work so well so I revert to kqemu.
00:52	<jPratt>	kk thx
00:52	<fluidd>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.
00:52	<pifedo>	tanath: I'm on a live session.. I just started the CD image I downloaded today..
00:52	<hansin>	Oh, you wanted source...
00:52	<rich_freecomm>	1288 files of upgrade to dl, 1288 files of upgrade, finish one up, save it to drive, 1287 files of upgrade to dl
00:53	<phiqtion>	unop: is audacious in the repos?
00:53	<Myke516>	i have hardy but i am having trouble updating packages
00:53	<tanath>	hansin, heh
00:53	<phiqtion>	!audacious
00:53	<ubotu>	audacious is included in !Feisty. A !repository also exists for !Edgy: see http://audacious-media-player.org/Downloads
00:53	<eternal_p>	nibsa1242b: Office 2003 via Crossover (wine) is perfect
00:53	<Gman99999>	interesting
00:53	<jwwadk>	Dason: right, but the power management options to change it have disappeared
00:53	<McJester82>	does anyone know the horiz and VertSync for the PowerPC G4
00:53	<fdsjkalf>	aww. its slowing down now
00:53	<Dason>	Just compile your own Upgrade!
00:53	<Gman99999>	I have skype but it sure sucks with linux
00:53	<nibsa1242b>	DBautell: sven_oostenbrink to the best of my knowledge, there is no 64 bit version of wine because it is attempting to emulate a 32bit OS
00:53	<unop>	phiqtion, sorry, you said xmms2 .. you might need an xmms gui -- but audacious is available yes
00:53	<tanath>	phiqtion, it is
00:53	<Dason>	lol jk
00:53	<x1250>	Gman99999: http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/
00:53	<Wyleyrabbit>	anyone have any tips on getting my extra mouse buttons to do what they're supposed to? (I have a left-thumb button that should hit back button in browser, etc.)
00:53	<jPratt>	Can you do office 07 with Wine?
00:53	<eternal_p>	Gman99999: skype works fine for me, just google metabunut repositories
00:53	<ng0n>	ya.. skype is not so good in linux..
00:53	<Dason>	jwwadk let me look into this
00:53	<tanath>	!mouse
00:53	<ubotu>	Enabling extra mouse buttons: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ManyButtonsMouseHowto  - Enabling serial mouse: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SerialMouseHowto
00:53	<jwwadk>	thanks
00:53	<nibsa1242b>	Wyleyrabbit: what mouse do you have?
00:54	<tanath>	Wyleyrabbit, ^
00:54	<ng0n>	which i don't understand as it's a ROBUST program, by and large.
00:54	<Gman99999>	I cant even call out with skype on ubuntu
00:54	<Datalanche>	maco: I still think this is a grub and/or devmapping issue. I had this problem once before in Edgy or whenever they changed up the ATA a while back, and fixed it by installing Ubuntu on a drive on the PCI controller and it worked flawlessly. I guess I'll just have to scramble my drives and do it that way again... annoying as it is. >_>
00:54	<Jack_Sparrow>	!appdb >	jPratt
00:54	<crimsun>	maco: pong
00:54	<Gman99999>	it will only do pc to pc calls
00:54	<jPratt>	!appdb
00:54	<ubotu>	The Wine Application DB is a database of applications and help for !Windows programs that run under !WINE: http://appdb.winehq.org
00:54	<DBautell>	nibsa1242b, you've given me new hope
00:54	<rich_freecomm>	Gman99999: yeah, a friend of mine on Winblows was having a hard time trying to tell me how to start video
00:54	<phiqtion>	how can i get audacious? its not in the package mananger
00:54	<joh6nn>	unop: i occasionally get some odd screen artifacts, with vim (and other apps that do their own special thing with the term, like top), and when i end them, the term doesn't "page", for lack of a better term, like i'm used to; it leaves all the stuff from vim or top or what-have-you on the screen, and just starts a new line
00:54	<jvai_>	i use gizmo works better
00:54	<Wyleyrabbit>	nibsa1242b: I have a logitech laser mouse. note sure particular part #
00:54	<phiqtion>	n/m found it
00:54	<tanath>	!mouse >	Wyleyrabbit
00:54	<ng0n>	ATA upgrade did good stuff for my Gigabyte board.
00:54	<eternal_p>	Gman99999: what error does it give you when you try?
00:54	<Gman99999>	no error just no sound
00:55	<Dason>	jwwadk What version are you using again, and where do you find YOUR brightness settings?
00:55	<Wyleyrabbit>	thanks tanath
00:55	<jPratt>	w00t CSS!
00:55	<tanath>	np
00:55	<DEstlund>	(sorry for the repeat) hardy keeps barfing during install saying files don't match - I take it I should re-download gutsy, burn and install it, and upgrade to hardy from within? I don't get this problem.
00:55	<ng0n>	w00t !
00:55	<Gman99999>	eternal_p I dont hear a thing at all when I call a land line or cellphone
00:55	<Jack_Sparrow>	Gman99999, /join #Alsa
00:55	<zigford>	GDAY
00:55	<Dason>	normally
00:55	<pifedo>	Why pulseaudio? Why firefox BETA!? NOthing works!! Firefox fonts sucks! My audio doesn't work! I lost my time!
00:55	<unop>	joh6nn, i know what you mean, the contents of vim,top,etc stay on .. altscreen on ought to sort that
00:55	<x1250>	pifedo: it works for me
00:55	<joh6nn>	unop: thanks, i'll give that a shot. : )
00:55	<DEstlund>	I've burned four coasters, but all of them pass the disk check and contain valid data
00:55	<nomopofomo>	Why don't my NTFS automount settings in my fstab file work any longer?
00:55	<nibsa1242b>	DBautell: I think you can run it in a 32bit chroot. (I used to run a 32bit firefox that way). I have no idea how to do that anymore though. I just switched to 32bit because I didn't see any reason to run everything 64bit.
00:55	<Gman99999>	but when I call another skype user it works just fine
00:55	<tanath>	pifedo, they work great...
00:55	<eternal_p>	Gman99999: first result in google: http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=4489 :)
00:55	<unop>	joh6nn, also while in .screenrc .. place 'clear' in too
00:56	<bododo_>	hi :)
00:56	<SeaPhor>	DEstlund, did you burn them at a slower speed?
00:56	<rich_freecomm>	Gman99999: weirdness
00:56	<jwwadk>	Dason I'm using 8.04 (upgraded today, love it except for this problem), and I can't seem to find my monitor settings. Since upgrading, the hotkeys on my laptop for changing brightness do not work, and the brightness options have disappeared from power management
00:56	<pifedo>	they use to work fine.. not in 8.06! (to me!)
00:56	<Acalorado>	hi, hola
00:56	<tanath>	pifedo, you are running from a livecd, no?
00:56	<Acalorado>	quiero hacer un servido LTSP
00:56	<bododo_>	i'm having troubles with my bcm4318 wifi on a ibook G4 :(
00:56	<Myke516>	can someone assist me in a synaptic package manager issue in 8.04?
00:56	<Acalorado>	Quien m ayuda
00:56	<pifedo>	I think my system isn't rare.. Asus p5b-plus with ICH8 intel chip..
00:56	<tanath>	pifedo, sometimes things don't work right on the disc
00:56	<Ertyle>	!es | Acalorado
00:56	<ubotu>	Acalorado: Aquí solamente hablamos inglés. Para Español, por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es o #kubuntu-es - allí obtendrá más ayuda.
00:56	<fluidd>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.
00:56	<Dason>	jwwadk Yea I noticed that too. You may have to re-enable that
00:56	<DEstlund>	i'm burning them at 1x right now, but I don't see why the ubuntu 8.04 cd would be any different than 7.10, or any other cd for that matter. The burns are valid
00:56	<Jack_Sparrow>	Myke516, the servers are overloaded,
00:56	<nibsa1242b>	Wyleyrabbit: I use btnx on my Logitech mice. I find it very useful. ( http://www.ollisalonen.com/btnx/ )
00:56	<bododo_>	it just doesn't work :(
00:57	<jwwadk>	Dason do you know how I would do that?
00:57	<Acalorado>	#chile
00:57	<pifedo>	tanath: I already installed the system (BETA) some weeks ago and had the same problem
00:57	<rich_freecomm>	I'm only 1286 files away from running 8.04 :D
00:57	<Dason>	18.2x is a permissible write speed
00:57	<Myke516>	Ah i was thinking that
00:57	<Jack_Sparrow>	DEstlund, burning slow does make a difference, I can attest to that
00:57	<Myke516>	so far 8.04 is running great though!
00:57	<tanath>	pifedo, well... packages have changed since then
00:57	<x1250>	Acalorado: entra en #ubuntu-es, yo te ayudo si puedo
00:57	<Jack_Sparrow>	DEstlund, dells and hp really prefer slow burns
00:57	<anathematic>	how would i update my ubuntu server to run the latest version?
00:57	<Alex_Sc21>	Ubuntu 8.04.. SO PUMPED!!!
00:57	<Ertyle>	!upgrade >	anathematic    (anathematic, see the private message from Ubotu)
00:57	<joh6nn>	unop: that did it, thanks!
00:57	<anathematic>	ty
00:58	<tanath>	pifedo, firefox for instance seems to be the fastest & most stable i've seen so far, even though it's beta
00:58	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: that is a trouble card! I know to get mine to work I had to enable it in restricted drivers manager
00:58	<Light|DC>	To prevent overload on the servers, couldnt Canocial release the torrent first, then provide direct downloads a day later?
00:58	<unop>	joh6nn, yw
00:58	<Dason>	jwwadk U will be back soon, I need to restart here
00:58	<joetheodd>	Are repositories down?
00:58	<anathematic>	Ertyle: i can't see anything for ubuntu 8 there?
00:58	<Dason>	"I"
00:58	<Jack_Sparrow>	Light|DC, doo discussion toppic for #Ubuntu-offtopic
00:58	<jwwadk>	ok, thanks
00:58	<Light|DC>	ohk
00:58	<DEstlund>	Jack_Sparrow: I'm giving it a try right now - it's not a brand name pc, just a scrap heap I put together (but with good parts) Still it seems odd that I can clone a game dvd for backup with no problem but Ubuntu doesn't like it
00:58	<sean_>	tanath: Direct rendering is supported for "intel". Still no decorations though
00:58	<e2>	Please help.  I can't get desktop effects to work after upgrading to 8.04.
00:58	<unop>	Light|DC, part of the upgrade process is canonical ensuring it's servers are capable, so it's a testing time :)
00:58	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: i did :( and yes you're right
00:58	<dogmeat>	us.archive.ubuntu.com ?
00:58	<dogmeat>	hello
00:58	<bododo_>	it's a dmaned card
00:58	<DEstlund>	alright - burn is done! With any luck you won't see me again in 10 minutes - thanks Jack_Sparrow
00:59	<e2>	I'm using an Nvidia card on an x86 (celeron) box
00:59	<Jack_Sparrow>	np
00:59	<tanath>	sean_, did you run 'compiz --replace &' from terminal?
00:59	<tomd123>	did anyone get the alternate cd to work and install?
00:59	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: additionally, after a few hours of heavy surfing the card progressively looses its connection and I have to "sudo modprobe -r bcm43xx" and then "sudo modprobe bcm43xx" to get it working again.
00:59	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: What version of Ubuntu do you have?
00:59	<sean_>	tanath: yup. want me to pastebin?
00:59	<dabbill>	I cant get my nvidia driver to work in Hardy, every time i reboot it goes back to low graphics mode
00:59	<Ertyle>	anathematic: ouch, it's not been updated... well, the instructions for ->7.10 should apply for the most part
00:59	<Deiz>	So, as with every time I install Ubuntu, windows maximize to both my monitors instead of one. Is there a workaround? I recall with 7.04 I got lucky after a reboot and it started working properly.
00:59	<tanath>	e2, 'gksu displayconfig-gtk' to make sure you have the right driver installed
00:59	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: the new one; hardy
00:59	<tanath>	sean_, did it say anything interesting?
01:00	<towlieban>	hi
01:00	<ng0n>	dabbilt: wat nvida card you got, or is it on board ?
01:00	<bradlis7>	is the xorg.conf file not in use in hardy?
01:00	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: it used to seem to work at a distnce of 3 meters with gutsy
01:00	<tanath>	bradlis7, it is...
01:00	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: I can't help you there... haven't been able to upgrade. I'm waiting for the repos to be less swamped.
01:00	<unop>	bradlis7, it can be, but xorg can work without one
01:00	<e2>	It's an old 128 Mb NVidia card.  Worked just fine with compiz on 7.10.
01:00	<Jack_Sparrow>	bradlis7, xorg is entirely different with this release
01:00	<Ertyle>	anathematic: though to be honest, i think you'd be better off waiting until the mirrors actually start working again and there is some documentation
01:00	<doug2266778822>	 why do the animations not work in compiz?
01:00	<jjt001>	Dason: you just need to look harder
01:00	<bradlis7>	so how do i manage the config?
01:00	<anathematic>	Ertyle: yeah i think i might wait anyway ty
01:00	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: but the solution should be the same, right?
01:00	<bradlis7>	is there another file?
01:01	<unop>	bradlis7, you could create one i guess
01:01	<x1250>	bradlis7: it is, but its minimal because xorg tries to autodetect things. You can edit it by hand, its your choice
01:01	<ng0n>	5200 ?
01:01	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: can I pm you, please?
01:01	<jjt001>	Dason: there are open source alternatives to almost everything
01:01	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: mine works within about a 10-12meter range in Gutsy... which is about half the range I get in Windows
01:01	<SeaPhor>	i've just finished downloading the ISO, do I "open with ~creator" or "write to disk">?
01:01	<ng0n>	pci,  pci-express ?
01:01	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: sure pm away
01:01	<tanath>	bradlis7, 'gksu displayconfig-gtk' will give you a gui for configuring it
01:01	<bradlis7>	i have nvidia, but it doesn't seem to be able to use it
01:01	<sean_>	tanath: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64294/
01:01	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, write to disk is what I use
01:01	<navetz>	i am trying to set up my server to send email
01:01	<dabbill>	ng0n, 8800GT
01:01	<oddalot>	bradlis7 i'm having problems with nvidia and my crt displaying
01:01	<nomopofomo>	my NTFS automount stopped working in 8.04
01:02	<nomopofomo>	does anyone know why?
01:02	<doug2266778822>	can anyone help me get the animations for the windows to work in compiz?
01:02	<akorn>	anybody know the shortcut/macro keys to load up Tracker Search?
01:02	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, Thanks Bro!
01:02	<Jack_Sparrow>	np
01:02	<ng0n>	dab: o.  rats.
01:02	<e2>	HELP - I'm stuck at 1024 x 768 and no desktop effects.
01:02	<navetz>	does anyone know how i can set up my server to send email's?
01:02	<nibsa1242b>	nomopofomo: read the release notes
01:02	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, burn at a slow speed
01:02	<tanath>	sean_, doesn't seem you have the right driver
01:02	<nohelphere>	i still have the same exact issue
01:02	<jwwadk>	e2, have you checked the screen resolution options?
01:02	<metanil>	i tried to add other application and got "failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntudists/hardy/Release.gpg" .. and so on
01:02	<oddalot>	blah, stupid resolutions are retarded on heron
01:02	<cafuego>	Both Pidgin and Evolution have stopped being able to create SSL and TLS connections this morning. They don't print any debug info on the cmdline. Am I missing something obvious?
01:02	<dabbill>	brb tryin some thing
01:02	<e2>	Yep.  1024 x 768 is max.
01:02	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, slowest option i have is 18.6?
01:02	<ng0n>	huh.
01:02	<bradlis7>	i have a flat screen... i finally got the nv driver to work, and the resolution works right when logged in, but the GDM resolution is too big, and displaymanager-gtk has never used the resolution that it says it uses
01:02	<sean_>	tanath: it passes the direct rendering test though
01:02	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, np use that
01:02	<jwwadk>	what's the max resolution on your monitor?
01:03	<e2>	I usually have this issue until the nvidia driver is installed and enabled.
01:03	<oddalot>	800x600 max on my 21 inch monitor, that's if i turn off 3d drivers
01:03	<e2>	Before the upgrade = 1280 x 1024.
01:03	<oddalot>	with 3d drivers i get 680x480 max
01:03	<bradlis7>	yeah, mine's showing 800x600, but it's supposed to be 1440x900
01:03	<oddalot>	e2, we are in the same boat
01:03	<nohelphere>	the x server crashes and restarts
01:03	<oddalot>	all of us
01:03	<oddalot>	stupid upgrade
01:03	<nohelphere>	can only start in a filsafe session
01:03	<tanath>	sean_, glxinfo says direct rendering: yes ?
01:03	<x1250>	oddalot: try adding vertical and horizontal refresh rates on xorg.conf
01:03	<nohelphere>	kubuntu is completely fine
01:03	<sean_>	tanath: yeah, that one
01:03	<tanath>	sean_, odd
01:03	<e2>	oddalot: how?
01:03	<jPratt>	How do i get wine
01:04	<Jack_Sparrow>	!wine
01:04	<ubotu>	WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine for more information, and see !AppDB for application compatibility.
01:04	<oddalot>	i don't know what they are supposed to be, this monitor is too old, doesn't have specs
01:04	<smallfoot->	jPratt, $ sudo apt-get install wine
01:04	<nohelphere>	i NEED to us ekubuntu i can't us eubuntu
01:04	<jwwadk>	jPratt you should be able to download it from the package manager
01:04	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, I'm gonna try the live cd first, see what works and what doesnt, then upgrade, see what happens but i'll have the full-fresh install option because i have /home on seperate partition
01:04	<dfgas>	!mirrors
01:04	<ubotu>	Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive - PLEASE use the !torrents to download Hardy, and help keeping the servers' load low!
01:04	<nomopofomo>	nibsa1242b, there's nothing in the release notes about NTFS
01:04	<theunixgeek_>	The loading bar in the usplash keeps bobbing back and forth instead of actually loading. how do I fix this?
01:04	<bradlis7>	we need to start a chat about resolution problems
01:04	<oddalot>	i should of saved my xorg.conf from 7.10
01:04	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, you can also consider dual boot...
01:04	<tanath>	someone needs to write a guide..
01:05	<smallfoot->	oddalot, i did :)
01:05	<e2>	One of those things you think would have been ironed out in the beta.
01:05	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, I have xp, gutsy and hardy.... here
01:05	<JPSmon>	Help I have no sound
01:05	<oddalot>	smallfoot, do you have a CRT?
01:05	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, already am with winders, 1 more might confusse me too much lol
01:05	<akorn>	anybody know the shortcut/macro keys to load up Tracker Search?
01:05	<smallfoot->	oddalot, yes, and it does not support EDID :(
01:05	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: starts with the "nosplash" kernel option and remove the "quiet" option, and see where it gets stuck
01:05	<metanil>	i tried to add other application and got "Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntudists/hardy/Release.gpg" .. and so on
01:05	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, np
01:05	<oddalot>	what is edid?
01:05	<simonft2>	JPSmon: seems like computer problem
01:05	<smallfoot->	oddalot, it reads stats from monitor and automatically use good values
01:05	<simonft2>	is ubuntu showing the volume on?
01:06	<Ertyle>	metanil, mirrors are bogged down, see /topic
01:06	<JPSmon>	nope - the mice in the generator wheel are dead
01:06	<nibsa1242b>	nomopofomo: sorry, my bad I read NTFS as NFS
01:06	<oddalot>	smallfoot- can you email me your working xorg.conf : oddalot@yahoo.com
01:06	<bazhang>	ljl is that you? ;]
01:06	<bradlis7>	it's kind of annoying that they took displaymanager-gtk off the menu, and didn't replace it
01:06	<Ertyle>	bazhang: no
01:06	<bradlis7>	i can still use it, but it's annoying
01:06	<bazhang>	haha
01:06	<JPSmon>	simonft2: no, shows with a red circle
01:06	<smallfoot->	oddalot, ok but im not sure you can use it
01:06	<nomopofomo>	nibsa1242b, that's what I thought :) it's okay though, i found that my harddrives aren't hda1 etc anymore but sda etc
01:06	<oddalot>	wait
01:06	<A|ysum>	hello is "64bit AMD and Intel computers" ubuntu download the right one for Core 2 Duo CPUs ? thx
01:06	<oddalot>	brandlis how do you get to it now?
01:07	<simonft2>	JPSmon: ah, your joking.
01:07	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, However, I have not logged into my windows partition in so long,,, i would have to spend the first 3 hours on win-updates, AV updates, and a reboot or 2,,,,
01:07	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: ata1: failed to read native max address (err_mask=0x4)
01:07	<bradlis7>	nvidia restricted driver doesn't show up on my hardware drivers either
01:07	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: but booting in recovery mode works
01:07	<JPSmon>	was
01:07	<pure`eigenVector>	lol
01:07	<nomopofomo>	bradlis7, to fix that you need to go into synaptic and enable third party software, then install nvidia-glx-new
01:07	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, I disabled the network card in my windows partition.. too much work to keep it running online..
01:07	<oddalot>	brandlis7 how do you open the display menu?
01:07	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: upgrade or fresh install?
01:07	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: fresh
01:07	<apathetic->	Guise, my xlib.h doesnt exist, i install the xlib-dev pack, but i cannot find it
01:07	<bradlis7>	nomopofomo: thx
01:08	<pure`eigenVector>	I guess everybody's updating... slow download for updates... would it be faster to update from the torrent?
01:08	<dfgas>	!mirror
01:08	<ubotu>	Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://nl.releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive - PLEASE use the !torrents to download Hardy, and help keeping the servers' load low!
01:08	<smallfoot->	oddalot, sent... but i have nvidia geforce, microsoft mouse, etc.. so it might not work for you
01:08	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: ok, now it says ist's EH complete
01:08	<pure`eigenVector>	thx ubotu!
01:08	<dabbill>	any one useing a 8800GT in Hardy? if so how did you get your nvidia driver installed and working
01:08	<oddalot>	i have geforce
01:08	<smallfoot->	oh
01:08	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: and ata2 is EH complete
01:08	<oddalot>	it might work
01:08	<smallfoot->	ya, it might
01:08	<oddalot>	i'll just erase the mouse part
01:08	<oddalot>	thankS!!
01:08	<smallfoot->	else you might need edit some stuff
01:08	<smallfoot->	:)
01:08	<Ubuntong>	Does 8.04 support Compiz on an ATI 3850?
01:08	<rawb>	i'm getting these errors on a 8.04 server in /var/log/syslog - how can I fix this? http://pastie.caboo.se/186502
01:08	<DBautell>	oddalot, I think I've had luck in the past looking up syncs and stuff here: http://www.monitorworld.com/monitors_home.html
01:08	<bradlis7>	oddalot: alt-f2 ->	gksudo displayconfig-gtk
01:08	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, ? ohhh, so you dont use internrt in windows?
01:08	<b4l74z4r>	i installed the oss system in ubuntu a while back and i can't remember where it installed itself, how do i find the right location?
01:08	<nomopofomo>	dabbill, you need to go into synaptic, enable third party software repositories, then install nvidia-glx-new
01:08	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: it keeps telling me over and over that EH complete for ata2
01:08	<phiqtion>	what are the colors on this look called? metacity or gtk2?
01:08	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, none...
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	phiqtion: what look?
01:09	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: is there also an "xfermode" error?
01:09	<phiqtion>	thunixgeek: human
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: no
01:09	<dfgas>	anyone know of a good mirror to download at, i am on 5 megabit and would like it fast
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: now I'm in Busybox
01:09	<simonft2>	dfgas: too bad
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: ALERT: /dev/somethingsomething/ does not exist!
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	:S
01:09	<nownot>	everytime i try to apt-get install something i get couldn't find package
01:09	<oddalot>	DBautell: no luck it's not on the list, too old :D
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	dfgas: torrent
01:09	<boolka>	how do i turn on svideo output on my laptop? ( the function key + f4  dont work - did in windows) ?
01:09	<theunixgeek_>	dfgas: see topic
01:10	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, lmao, Thats probably the BEST way to use windows!
01:10	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: /dev/disk/by-uuid/something?
01:10	<DBautell>	oddalot, well, I tried
01:10	<Jack_Sparrow>	nownot, again, the servers are tied up.. dont expect to get anything from them
01:10	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: yeah
01:10	<mvinsc>	when i install will my Broadcom card work? I use windows drivers now.
01:10	<bazhang>	nownot: best enable some more repos then
01:10	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, It works for me..
01:10	<dabbill>	nomopofomo, what one? all i have listed in there seems to be ones for 7.10, the 1 thats listed in there for 8.04 is already checked
01:10	<nownot>	Jack_Sparrow: doest even look like its trying to look though
01:10	<nownot>	bazhang:  pls explain
01:10	<oddalot>	brandlis i think that might of fixed it THANKS
01:10	<cwillu>	mvinsc, you shouldn't need to use ndiswrapper anymore
01:11	<bazhang>	nownot: please pastebin your sources.list
01:11	<cwillu>	mvinsc, install b43-fwcutter after you install, and it should work
01:11	<bradlis7>	yup (and it's bradlis7, no n)
01:11	<mvinsc>	really!
01:11	<cwillu>	mvinsc, qualified maybe :p
01:11	<Jack_Sparrow>	nownot, did it ever get through apt-get update ?
01:11	<fsufitch>	hi, could anyone here help me set up a multimonitor output via VGA (or a clone output) in KDE 3.5? (also running compiz)
01:11	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: you might want to try booting with the "irqpoll" kernel option, given bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/204916 (and also possibly related https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/107982 and https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/112132)
01:11	<oddalot>	i like brandlis :D
01:11	<CaptainMorgan>	I'm trying to find the remaining disk space on a remote ubuntu system.... anyone got a command line for it ?
01:11	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: thanks
01:11	<cwillu>	mvinsc, if you're not doing a fresh install, make sure you undo any blacklisting stuff you did previously
01:11	<towlieban>	i ran update manager and its downloading 79 packages. does that sound right for an update from gutsy to hardy or are those just gutsy updates ?
01:11	<cwillu>	remove ndiswrapper configs, etc
01:12	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: the irqpoll has always bugged me in every distro - ubuntu, fedora, etc
01:12]  * bradlis7 laughs
01:12	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: although, the fact that recovery mode works leaves me perplexed
01:12	<flamedryad>	i is back
01:12	<linkmaster03>	When I open xsane, this comes up, and the program immedietly exits: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
01:12	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: but you were using Gutsy without it?
01:12	<Jack_Sparrow>	CaptainMorgan, free ?
01:12	<Liquidy>	CaptainMorgan: df -a
01:12	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: yeah
01:12	<CaptainMorgan>	Jack_Sparrow, yes
01:12	<mvinsc>	ok. thanks
01:12	<dabbill>	nomopofomo, also it shows that i have nvidia-glx-new installed
01:12	<simonft2>	!Segmentation fault
01:12	<towlieban>	can anyone answer me
01:12	<nownot>	Jack_Sparrow:  doing it now
01:12	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: was your drive /dev/sdwhatever or /dev/hdwhatever in gutsy?
01:12	<towlieban>	i ran update manager and its downloading 79 packages. does that sound right for an update from gutsy to hardy or are those just gutsy updates ?
01:12	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: not sure
01:12	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: but now it's booting normally
01:12	<pen>	anyone here know how to use avatar-factory??
01:12	<Ertyle>	towlieban: doesn't sound right
01:12	<cwillu>	towlieban, probably just gutsy
01:13	<fsufitch>	towlieban: that sounds a little too little for that ;)
01:13	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: how do I change grub to always boot with irqpoll?
01:13	<bradlis7>	i think there were 1000 packages that i had to update
01:13	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: (I'm logged in now :D )
01:13	<fsufitch>	i'm doing the same upgrade and it has 1.5k "files"
01:13	<Ertyle>	theunixgeek_: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst - however be aware that irqpoll does take a toll on performance (not sure how bad a toll, but)
01:13	<towlieban>	1500 packages ?????/
01:13	<mattycoze>	hey everyone, what's the command to update to 8.04?
01:13	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: oh well, ya gotta do what ya gotta do ;)
01:13	<Ertyle>	towlieban: that would me more like it
01:13	<towlieban>	how many packages are there for an update from gutsy to hardy  ?
01:13	<fsufitch>	dunno if they're packages themselves
01:13	<theunixgeek_>	Ertyle: thanks a bunch :)
01:14	<linkmaster03>	When I open xsane, this comes up, and the program immedietly exits: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
01:14	<Abd>	i have to update 1237 files and at 1057 file
01:14	<Ertyle>	towlieban, it depends on how many packages you had installed on your gutsy
01:14	<Abd>	not much longer to wait
01:14	<clay>	hey, anybody know how to install lightning 0.8 w/ thunderbird for 8.04?
01:14	<Ertyle>	but basically it will update every package
01:14	<jPratt>	I cant get wi e
01:14	<jPratt>	wine**
01:14	<phiqtion>	how can i unpack a .RAR archive
01:14	<fsufitch>	towlieban: see, Abd agrees w/ me sorta
01:14	<xb3rt>	i downloaded a .tar.bz2 firewall package, extracted it and cant run make or make install, any reason for this?

01:15	<Liquidy>	phiqtion: www.rarlab.com :)
01:15	<cabrioleur>	linkmaster03, this usually means that the application was compiled using different libraries than what you currently have. Revert to previous version, it might fix problem. You can also compile your own xsane.
01:15	<jPratt>	E: Couldn't find package wine
01:15	<oddalot>	YES, that fixed it branlis7
01:15	<Ertyle>	jPratt: you need Universe enabled

01:15	<xb3rt>	Ertyle, i can do the ./configure but thats as far as it gets
01:15	<fsufitch>	jPratt: do you have universe enabled?
01:15	<kswo>	Hello, If I have an older version of ubuntu and I want to get the new version, do I need to re-download/install the newest version or can I use the internet update feature?
01:15	<IndyGunFreak>	jPratt: or add the wine repository
01:15	<oddalot>	that is annoying that they didn't include the display option in the menus
01:15	<Ertyle>	xb3rt: then what happens? use pastebin if necessary
01:15	<simonft2>		!update
01:15	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes

01:16	<Twigathy>	I'm trying to set up an NFSroot style Hardy install, but the boot always hangs at "eth0: link up" (This is after the nfs-premount script runs). Is there any way of nuking network manager or anything which will mess about with the networking?
01:16	<jPratt>	how do you enable universe?
01:16	<Ertyle>	mOrO^: use the torrents, see /topic
01:16	<xb3rt>	Ertyle, how do i use pastebin

01:18	<SeaPhor>	Jack_Sparrow, The funniest thing is, I work for HP testing wireless lan and wan on new platforms of vista and xp, and thats the one question i still have here, how to get my rtl8185 to work on my own PC!
01:18	<mOrO^>	Ertyle, Im one of them dar Linux newbies. I like for my computer to ask me, WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY! I hit the switch and KDE comes up.
01:18	<tony403>	fsufitch, have you tried #xorg?
01:19	<cabrioleur>	fsufitch, compiz should have no effect on your monitor setup. What graphic card do you have?
01:19	<fsufitch>	tony403: i thought it would be something ubuntu-specific
01:19	<sammy>	where does debconf get my root partition from, the partition where it gets the UUID it wants to put in my grub menu.1st ?
01:19	<linkmaster03>	cabrioleur: where can I download the xsane source? i see binaries on the website
01:19	<fsufitch>	cabrioleur: i have an integrated intel
01:19	<fsufitch>	running  on a dell b134
01:19	<boolka>	how do i turn on svideo output on my laptop? ( the function key + f4  dont work - did in windows) ?
01:19	<fsufitch>	*b130
01:19	<towlieban>	i really hope hardy fixes the problem with sleeping when i close the lid of my laptop
01:19	<raiderxx>	So I just upgraded to hardy heron. But I don't see any difference
01:19	<raiderxx>	SHOULD I?
01:19	<theunixgeek>	raiderxx: read the features thingy
01:19	<tony403>	fsufitch, no, ubuntu doesn't natively use kde. you could try #kubuntu as well but maybe someone here knows also
01:19	<tarkus>	anyone know how to get postgresql server running?
01:19	<sammy>	I've edited manually, since I moved my root partition, and it wants to change it back. I'd like to avoid problems in the future and change wherever on my system it's still getting that my root partition is where it used to be
01:19	<JPSmon>	does anyone know where I can get good cube-top-wallpapers?
01:20	<mattycoze>	if i've already download the Hardy LTS 8.04 iso file is there a way to update the pC with that instead of wiping the pC clean and doing a fresh install?
01:20	<JPSmon>	preferably transparent?
01:20	<Ertyle>	mOrO^, still not sure what you mean, but the CD image that you get from torrent is the very same image that you'd get from the web server (if it worked)
01:20	<raiderxx>	theunixgeek: where can I find that?
01:20	<theunixgeek>	raiderxx: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/804features/
01:20	<raiderxx>	thanks
01:20	<bazhang>	mattycoze: live or alternate
01:20	<cabrioleur>	linkmaster03, ftp://sunsite.uio.no/pub/sane/xsane/xsane-0.995.tar.gz - most recent one
01:20	<Liquidy>	raiderxx: if you upgraded all of your applications on your previous distro you wouldn't have to see any diference :)
01:20	<towlieban>	matty you mean upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 ?
01:20	<sammy>	hmm. I should come back a few weeks after upgrade day.
01:20	<linkmaster03>	cabrioleur thank you very much
01:20	<JPSmon>	mattycoze: not with THAT CD, you have to download the alternate install CD
01:20	<raiderxx>	liquidy: I upgrade regularly
01:20	<Ertyle>	!build-essential >	xb3rt    (xb3rt, see the private message from Ubotu) install this package

01:21	<bazhang>	mattycoze: need the alternate then
01:21	<navetz_>	my apt-get just broke on me

01:21	<theunixgeek>	ryoohki: this one
01:21	<Liquidy>	if you keep it up to date, and with everything been opensource, what did you expect of hardy?
01:21	<Liquidy>	it's nothing new

01:21	<theunixgeek>	ryoohki: (read the topic)
01:21	<unop>	mattycoze, but rathe that download the iso .. you might as well upgrade directly - see !upgrade if you are interested
01:21	<DrX>	I want to partition a 465G RAID 5 array to hold mission-critical data for optimal flexibility so it can hold Linux & Windows (NTFS) partitions that can be easily resized and grown onto additional drives -- what do you all suggest?
01:22	<_ZeuZ_>	Guys, is there any package in Ubuntu Server for Per-Host-In-The-Network bandwidth allowance control? Without having to use TCNG directly nor recurring to htb-gen nor htb.init ? I don-t want to use CBQ either...
01:22	<Ertyle>	ryoohki: this is it, but #ubuntu-release-party if it's not a support question
01:22	<theunixgeek>	cappicard: torrent (see titlte)
01:22	<theunixgeek>	*topic
01:22	<navetz_>	is there a way to fix apt-get?
01:22	<sammy>	or the torrent. right.
01:22	<jwwadk>	is anyone else having problems with brightness settings using hardy?
01:22	<dabbill>	no matter what i do i cant get my nvidia driver to take for my 8800GT, tried useing envyng, installing straight from nvidia website. Every time i reboot the computer it goes back in to low graphics mode. Also when i try to run nvidia-settings it says i am not useing the nvidia driver.
01:22	<oddalot>	anyone know how to get emerald themes in 8.04?
01:22	<_ZeuZ_>	dabill: get rid of the "bulletproof config"
01:22	<mattycoze>	yeh unop too late :P i downloaded the iso last night without thining too much
01:22	<gluer>	can i do a hardy upgrade from the full iso?
01:22	<_ZeuZ_>	dabill: manually edit the xorg.conf
01:22	<_ZeuZ_>	it's not hard
01:23	<unop>	mattycoze, shoulda come in here first :)
01:23	<_ZeuZ_>	you'll only have to remove a couple of lines
01:23	<cappicard>	ah, that got released?
01:23	<dabbill>	_ZeuZ_, tried many of times
01:23	<oddalot>	dabill...i had problems, i had to open the display thingy...it's not in the system menu anymore
01:23	<cappicard>	i'm still on gutsy. didn't know there was a new release. lol
01:23	<mattycoze>	unop yeah i was, there was already talk about the servers being blitzed

01:24	<dabbill>	_ZeuZ_, i had it working perfict in 7.10, but cant get it to work in 8.04
01:24	<oddalot>	anyone here got emerald working?
01:24	<unop>	mattycoze, ohh, ahh well - not to worry, you can redistribute the ISO to friends and family :)
01:24	<sammy>	Zasch: it's probably having a hard time talking to the servers, mine did that too. try running aptitude and picking a closer mirror to download from.
01:24	<cabrioleur>	fsufitch, have you tried the integrated gnome menu?
01:24	<_ZeuZ_>	dabbill, I'm on Hardy
01:24	<mohbana>	can i install from a ntfs partion, i don't have a dvd handy
01:24	<JPSmon>	cappicard:  stick with the old for a while till we get these bugs worked out
01:24	<mohbana>	without using wubi
01:24	<sammy>	Zasch: I mean synaptic, not aptitude.
01:24	<seamus7>	Zasch today is the first day of the release ... the servers always get slammed on day's like today ... just be patient
01:24	<_ZeuZ_>	PM me so I can show you
01:24	<Ertyle>	mohbana: i don't think so
01:24	<dabbill>	_ZeuZ_, what do you have the driver set as? nvidia or nv ?
01:24	<_ZeuZ_>	and help you
01:24	<cappicard>	ok, i agree on that.
01:24	<_ZeuZ_>	nvidia
01:24	<bradlis7>	hm, nvidia still not showing up in restricted drivers
01:24	<fsufitch>	cabrioleur: yes, i can get it workngi under gnome, but i prefer using my kde. is there a way to access the gnome menu in kde?
01:24	<bazhang>	mohbana: from within windows? try unetbootin or wubi then
01:24	<altj>	does Hardy have mysql 5.1?
01:25	<Ertyle>	!info mysql hardy | altj
01:25	<ubotu>	altj: Package mysql does not exist in hardy
01:25	<cappicard>	wubi works like a charm the last time I tried it

01:25	<_ZeuZ_>	dabbill, remember to identify first
01:25	<towlieban>	altj no you have to install it seperately
01:25	<KalEl>	hi.. can't join to #ubuntu+1

01:26	<Shpook>	Hello everyone, I have a laptop and I want to use the vga output to my tv, but I'm getting no video out of it. Is there a way to enable video output?
01:26	<KalEl>	oh great!
01:26	<SeaPhor>	_ZeuZ_, sure it does ;-) #SeaPhor
01:26	<jords>	servers are dead

01:26	<_ZeuZ_>	though Here I go
01:26	<bd__>	yea my update manager keeps crashing when I try to upgrade
01:26	<boolka>	how do i turn on svideo output on my laptop? ( the function key + f4  dont work - did in windows) ?
01:26	<Ertyle>	KalEl: try #ubuntu-release-party perhaps :)
01:26	<Daisuke_Ido>	Shpook, you'll probably have to use a fn key combo
01:26	<bmk789>	anyone else seeing high CPU usage with FF3 beta 5?
01:26	<dny>	well i knew they were busy, but i didn't know if that'd be the reason.  mine doesn't crash like everyone elses seems to do, it just doesn't show any new updates. :/
01:26	<simonft2>	bmk789: nope
01:26	<bazhang>	bmk789: what extensions yo have loaded
01:26	<goat|work>	anyone know why  the hardy update manager will not check the CD before requesting files from the repos... I have the CD option set in the software sources, and inserted, and I've unchecked the internet sources in the gutsy software sources
01:26	<cabrioleur>	fsufitch, also, here http://sernaonubuntu.wikidot.com/multiple-monitors is an interesting article how to modify xorg.conf (based on integrated intel card)
01:26	<simonft2>	bmk789: much less than ever
01:26	<sammy>	Zasch: synaptic package manager should be easy to find, look with the other administration tools. you're going to open the 'repositories' item in the menus, and there should be a drop-down list to select your mirror. you can then select 'other' and click the button to find your closest mirror.
01:27	<Shpook>	Daisuke_Ido: Sorry, I meant to mention that I tried that and it didn't work.
01:27	<KalEl>	Ertyle :)
01:27	<fsufitch>	cabrioleur: thx! i'll try
01:27	<jwwadk>	does anyone know how to control screen brightness without using the power manager?
01:27	<Pc_Madness>	are the repositories overloaded atm? :\
01:27	<bmk789>	bazhang: good question, ill try to disable a few and see what it does
01:27	<linkmaster03>	What is the GTK library package name?
01:27	<JPSmon>	goat|work: is it the alternat install CD?
01:27	<scizzo->	Pc_Madness: yes
01:27	<goat|work>	JPSmon: no desktop

01:27	<ANTDx1>	libgtk?
01:27	<nickrober>	anyone else having scratchy sound problems?
01:27	<scizzo->	Pc_Madness: hard to say since they are hammered with traffic really
01:27	<goat|work>	Pc_Madness: eta is now,  its just super slow
01:27	<Starnestommy>	linkmaster03: libgtk2.0-0
01:28	<Shpook>	Was it nvidia-settings or something that used to allow dual monitors?
01:28	<seamus7>	jwwadk I am able to adjust screen brightness by doing FN + arrowup/arrowdown
01:28	<linkmaster03>	thanks Starnestommy
01:28	<goat|work>	JPSmon: why wouldn't the desktop work over the alt install cd?
01:28	<goat|work>	as a software source
01:28	<Shpook>	seamus7: I'm basically trying to do the same thing as you, except with a cga output instead of s-video.
01:28	<smallfoot->	which i should install gnash, swfdef or adobe?
01:28	<Pc_Madness>	did Ubuntu mobile get released last night as well?
01:29	<MP2E>	Hello all
01:29	<cabrioleur>	Shpook, yes, nvidia-settings can modify xorg.conf to let you use multiple screens.

01:31	<Zasch>	instead of trying to upgrade through update manager, would it be faster to just download the CD?

01:31	<ANTDx1>	Paulius, install the openssh package
01:31	<MP2E>	could a scratch possibley have messed it up?
01:31	<cycom>	Paulius: it does the rest ;)
01:31	<MP2E>	But Disk Check doesn't work either
01:31	<bmk789>	cycom: ya but arent the images hosted on the same server?
01:31	<x1250>	Paulius: openssh-server or -client
01:31	<DrX>	if your hardware RAID controller lets you dynamically grow volume groups, do you still need to you LVM to grow partitions?
01:31	<Paulius>	cycom, ANTDx1: It says "package obsolete" on both.
01:32	<bazhang>	Zasch: likely both are slow at this point--torrents would be fastest
01:32	<ANTDx1>	hmm
01:32	<sammy>	oh, look at that, I wonder whats in /boot/grub/default? nope. thats not it.
01:32	<linkmaster03>	cabrioleur: I just installed xsane from source, this still shows and exits Segmentation fault (core dumped)

01:33	<unop>	sammy, perhaps from /dev/disk/by-uuid/  -- see also man volname, man vol_id
01:33	<IcemanV9>	qworty: read you just fine :)
01:33	<raiderxx>	goat|work: it says "We added in a program for making posters, signs, family tree charts, and everything else that you might think about taking to a print shop. "
01:33	<bazhang>	macchiea: dpkg -l
01:33	<seamus7>	Wonder why 8.04 isn't mentioned in a big flashy banner on ubuntu.com home? that's odd.
01:33	<cycom>	bmk789: I'm tempted to download all the torrents just to help seed :)
01:34	<MP2E>	Uh seamus7: it is
01:34	<qworty>	IcemanV9: So this is the internet?
01:34	<MP2E>	Update your Cache
01:34	<Shadow_X>	is awn in the repository? or do ya have to add another repo?
01:34	<cycom>	seamus7: hehehe
01:34	<bmk789>	cycom: thats what im doing now :) ive got a megabit up overnight
01:34	<ANTDx1>	seamus7, because adblock seems to be blocking it...

01:34	<RoAkSoAx>	Shadow_X, it is in the repository
01:34	<SkogsTrollet>	yes! äntligen!
01:34	<Shadow_X>	hrmm I cant find it >.>
01:34	<kilrae>	i installed with lvm from the alternate cd and have no grub or bootsplash, is this normal?
01:34	<seamus7>	ANTDx1: hee hee ... that was it .. AdBlock ... now I see it lol
01:34	<IcemanV9>	qworty: this is irc chat room ... online
01:34	<sammy>	unop: that's almost what I'm looking for. I've changed my menu.1st, and debconf, updating grub, wants to set the root BACK to my old partition.
01:34	<krasher>	Hey i can't get my desktop in 1024x768 using a Geforce FX-5200 and a LG StudioWorks 55i in Hardy Heron... anyone can help me? i had trouble getting this to work at 7.10... but i can't remeber what i did :(
01:34	<munkie>	how do you install the flash player
01:35	<qworty>	IcemanV9: how do I uninstall the internet?
01:35	<MP2E>	lawl
01:35	<SkogsTrollet>	den här versionen av ubuntu fungerar smärtfritt!
01:35	<MP2E>	Uninstall the internet

01:35	<MP2E>	LUlz
01:35	<sammy>	unop: so I already know the correct UUID, I just have no idea where to tell ubuntu where I've moved it to so I don't have to manually edit menu.1st regularly
01:35	<goat|work>	raiderxx: interesting... i'm looking for the prog
01:35	<DanaG>	Mirror works.
01:35	<Dasuraga>	I had a fX-5200, the only way to get it to work is by editing the xorg.conf
01:35	<Daisuke_Ido>	!lol | MP2E
01:35	<ubotu>	MP2E: Please don't use "LOL" and "OMG" and so forth on a regular basis. This is IRC, not IM, and using those lines on their own is not required, and it is rather annoying to the rest of the people in the channel; thanks.

01:35	<DanaG>	Just check dates.
01:35	<DanaG>	What should the "official" date be?
01:35	<raiderxx>	goat|work: Thanks a lot! I would, but I'm so new to this..
01:35	<IcemanV9>	qworty: what do you mean?
01:35	<linkmaster03>	<linkmaster03>	cabrioleur: I just installed xsane from source, this still shows and exits Segmentation fault (core dumped)
01:35	<unop>	sammy, maybe update-grub does that for you .. not sure
01:36	<DanaG>	Date and time, I mean.
01:36	<sammy>	unop: thanks anyway. I'll go poking around.
01:36	<MP2E>	Brb
01:36	<Gummi>	hi
01:36	<|ns|nR8>	anyone tried dual monitor support yet in 8.04 ? i couldnt get it going correctly in 7.10...
01:36	<qworty>	IcemanV9: Well... I didnt actually choose to install the internet... it just kind of came with my laptop. To be honest its rather rubbish, I cant download cake. How do I uninstall it?
01:36	<rhanthony>	Anyone here run a DNS server? recommendations for which package to go with?
01:36	<manuel__>	So have anybody heard of the WHITE SCREEN OF DEATH issue ??? I used envy to install the latest ATI driver, and now a white screen appears when I start gnome .... any idea???
01:37	<rhanthony>	apt-get says bind is missing or unknown
01:37	<RoAkSoAx>	rhanthony, sudo apt-get install bind9
01:37	<krasher>	﻿Hey i can't get my desktop in 1024x768 using a Geforce FX-5200 and a LG StudioWorks 55i in Hardy Heron... anyone can help me? i had trouble getting this to work at 7.10... but i can't remeber what i did :(
01:37	<goat|work>	raiderxx: its called Inkscape
01:37	<jedimasterk>	Is using thew Alternate CD better than the basic cd
01:37	<eternal_p>	rhanthony: named works well too
01:37	<goat|work>	!inkscape
01:37	<ubotu>	Inkscape is a powerful vector graphics drawing application - see http://www.inkscape.org/ for more

01:37	<raiderxx>	goat|work: Thank you! You guys are amazing on here!
01:38	<DBautell>	jedimasterk, yes and no, depending on your needs and circumstances

01:38	<dr_roboto>	morning all
01:38	<macabro22>	doodes. My upgrade process is halting at "authenticate '/tmp/tmpzy117N/hardy.tar.gz' against '/tmp/tmpzy117N/hardy.tar.gz.gpg'
01:38	<vbabiy-laptop>	Hey does canonical have any idea of how many installs they had today?
01:38	<IcemanV9>	jedimasterk: if you want to install via text console, then alter cd is good to use
01:38	<goat|work>	raiderxx: you asked if it was installed, i think its not, but its available in Synaptic once you have Hardy installed
01:38	<qworty>	Does anyone here know how to uninstall the internet? IcemanV9 is unable to help.
01:39	<[-Ghost-]>	n
01:39	<the7thmagus>	hey guys, I know you must be busy with Hardy installs. just wondering if I should get the x64 version? I have a 64 bit processor, but are there going to be software incompatibilities with 32 bit software?
01:39	<Abd>	100 files to go
01:39	<red22>	.
01:39	<goat|work>	qworty: unplug the cable or disable the wireless?
01:39	<tomd123>	qworty: if you don't know what you're talking about, I suggest googling it
01:39	<krasher>	Dasuraga: what?
01:39	<bazhang>	qworty: interesting question but not clear
01:39	<IcemanV9>	sorry, qworty. i do not understand your problem.
01:39	<Mark_G>	the7thmagus: stick with 32 until you're more experienced with compiling..
01:40	<the7thmagus>	alright. thanks
01:40	<monsieurledan>	smoooooth
01:40	<qworty>	goat|work: I have, but its spread to my family and friends computers. I didnt install it, but I cant uninstall it
01:40	<Abd>	the7thmagus you'll have a mcuh better peformance using a 64 bit OS on a 64 bit processor
01:40	<moDumass>	hey all, im goin through the distro upgrade process, and ive had a popup saying "Replace the customised configuration file '/etc/sysctl.conf'?" and im not soo sure if i should, any ideas?
01:40	<lopin>	I can't upgrade with the CD
01:40	<lopin>	It's locking up
01:40	<qworty>	tomd123: I tried googling it, but I keep being told that I need to grow up
01:40	<moDumass>	would it be safe to oversrite this file
01:40	<sean_>	tanath: I even tried using my old xorg.conf and that didn't help. =(
01:40	<DanaG>	yay, mirrors.kernel.org.
01:40	<duaneb>	hey, can anyone else connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com?
01:40	<the_darkside_986>	can someone help me with Hardy? I cannot figure out how to make it not go so slowly and laggy in every aspect.
01:41	<goat|work>	qworty: the internet has spread to your family and friends computers?  i think its too late man
01:41	<bazhang>	qworty: what is the internet--this sounds like offtopic not a ubuntu supprot question
01:41	<linkmaster03>	I just installed xsane from source after having this problem on a normal install, this still shows and exits Segmentation fault (core dumped)
01:41	<Noah0504>	Are the Ubuntu repos down?
01:41	<bazhang>	!ot | qworty
01:41	<ubotu>	qworty: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
01:41	<Dasuraga>	krasher:http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/xorg-config.xml
01:41	<lopin>	duaneb: Servers are being really hit hard
01:41	<duaneb>	are there and ubuntu mirrors?
01:41	<seamus7>	moDumass: just back it up and allow the upgrade to continue .. then you're covered.
01:41	<tanath>	no, i think you prolly had that right. looks like a compiz/xgl issue
01:41	<McJester82>	hope come when I boot my PPC, my screen is blank, but if I go to TTY and the straight back to F7, the screen appears
01:41	<Mark_G>	qworty: so you want to uninstall the internet?
01:41	<Dasuraga>	scroll down to tweaking xorg.com
01:41	<DanaG>	Use other servers.
01:41	<Dasuraga>	*.conf
01:41	<McJester82>	*how
01:41	<DanaG>	Look for
01:41	<DanaG>	argh, **** apostrophe key.
=== Mark_G is now known as iznuics
01:41	<DanaG>	Look for internet2 mirrors, if in the USA.
01:42	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 did you upgrade or is it a fresh install
01:42	<qworty>	bazhang: Its uninstalling the internet on Ubuntu... so yes I believe it is relevant
01:42	<the_darkside_986>	Fresh install
01:42	<moDumass>	seamus you are so much smarter than me
01:42	<Abd>	Noah0504 No, they are just too slow
01:42	<duaneb>	DanaG: sorry, could you explain more?
01:42	<rhanthony>	What do i do if my root password is not working?
01:42	<linkmaster03>	I just installed xsane from source after having this problem on a normal install, this still shows and exits immedietly with: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
01:42	<bazhang>	qworty: please stop now
01:42	<seamus7>	seamus7 not sure
01:42	<tomd123>	the_darkside_986: nice
01:42	<Starnestommy>	rhanthony: you don't nned the root password. use sudo instead
01:42	<duaneb>	rhanthony: do you have your regular account?
01:42	<duaneb>	do a 'sudo passwd'
01:42	<Noah0504>	Abd: Okay.  I figured it had something to do with the release.  I was trying to install some restricted drivers and it fails big time.
01:42	<rhanthony>	Is there a way to recover it?  I dont remember even putting one in during setup.
01:42	<Noah0504>	haha
01:42	<tomd123>	my install isn't fresh anymore, :_(
01:42	<MentalNotes>	the_darkside_98: do you have compiz enabled?
=== pawalls_ is now known as pawalls[work]
01:43	<rhanthony>	I have my regular accts yes... but I'd like to not have to type sudo each and every time I wanna do something.
01:43	<the_darkside_986>	nope. And it takes very long to boot up compared to Gutsy, and starting up GDM is extremely laggy and causes my CPU fan to spin for a long while. well now it quit
01:43	<qworty>	bazhang: I will stop. But just so you and anyone who reads this knows, the internet is a virus... and it could be coming to a computer near you!!
01:43	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger,
01:43	<x1250>	rhanthony: try $ sudo -s, or $ sudo su
01:43	<linkmaster03>	rhanthony: sudo -i makes the terminal root
01:43	<MP2E>	Ok I checked the MD5 and integrity of my Ubuntu 7.10 disk and it's fine, however the install on THIS computer fails on busybox
01:43	<the_darkside_986>	it is slow and laggy regardless of whether i have compiz or proprietary nvidia installed.
01:43	<MP2E>	While on my other comp I can install the whole thing easily
01:43	<pure`eigenVector>	is there a howto gusty->hardy upgrade guide when using the torrent download?
01:43	<DBautell>	rhanthony, ubuntu discourages logging in as root, and does not let you pick the password unless you sudo su and change it
01:43	<moveax>	hello. I'm trying to install a MetaCity theme for Gnome 2.22.1 on the latest Ubuntu release. When I click 'Install' and navigate to the theme tar.gz file and click Open, the appearance preferences dialog tells me it has installed correctly. However, the theme isn't in the list of available themes. What am I doing wrong here?
01:43	<rhanthony>	sweet cheesus... thank you!
01:44	<rhanthony>	So, I don't know what my root pass is?  I have to sudo su, and then set it?
01:44	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 wouldn't you have nvidia drivers with compiz enabled on top?
01:44	<mneptok>	rhanthony: do not set a root password
01:44	<DanaG>	warning: PDF:   www.internet2.edu/resources/Internet2MembersList.PDF  -- list
01:44	<KyleK>	moveax: i just drag and drop things perosnally
01:44	<jedimasterk>	Is using thew Alternate CD better than the basic cd
01:44	<MP2E>	This comp is an SiS 630/730 with an AMD Athlon 32-bit (old thing)
01:44	<mneptok>	rhanthony: use sudo -i if you need to run more than one command
01:44	<bazhang>	rhanthony: root on irc? hahahaha
01:44	<the_darkside_986>	It is slow even after I had installed nvidia-glx AND turned off compiz.
01:44	<qworty>	jedimasterk: Twice as good
01:44	<rhanthony>	mneptok: is not having a root pass, safe?
01:44	<DanaG>	List of members of internet2; it's a really fast network, and most members will have very large 'pipes' to them.
01:44	<rhanthony>	NOT going to irc as root... no.
01:44	<mneptok>	rhanthony: a hell of a lot safer than setting one
01:44	<bazhang>	jedimasterk: for doing what
01:44	<rhanthony>	in another ssh, want to just get alot of named/apache setup done
01:44	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 what kind of computer?
01:44	<Starnestommy>	rhanthony: it makes it much harder for crackers to gain control and sudo logs things, unlike root logins
01:45	<KyleK>	moveax: click customize maybe?
01:45	<moDumass>	DanaG I keep clogging my pipes with pictures
01:45	<DanaG>	http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/downloadmirrors
01:45	<the_darkside_986>	Not sure if slow is the best way to describe things. More like, something is making my CPU go crazy and hog CPU time. Compaq presario with 1024 MB of RAM and a celery CPU. Gutsy does not give this problem.
01:45	<Jobias>	stupid question, how do i know which version of ubuntu i'm running? i had a rough time upgrading, and i'm not sure whether i'm running 8.04 proper, or whether i'm still on the release candidate
01:45	<moDumass>	because you cant fold them, so zipping doesnt work
01:45	<KyleK>	moDumass: tubes
01:45	<DanaG>	Find things that are on both of those; also check dates on downloads.
01:45	<moveax>	KyleK: The theme isn't in the list - how do I customize something that isn't available?
01:45	<hwilde>	Jobias, cat /etc/lsb-release
01:45	<rhanthony>	Ok. Thanks for the tips.
01:45	<KyleK>	Jobias: rc ->	final is so not a dist-upgrade
01:45	<compengi>	Hello.. i'm facing a little problem with my vga after installing hardy. i installed the restricted drivers, but my resolution when to 640x480. and there is no higher option.
01:45	<rhanthony>	And thanks for no one yelling RTFM or GTFO.
01:45	<bazhang>	lsb_release -a Jobias
01:45	<rhanthony>	:)
01:45	<Mister-Toti>	sera
01:45	<IcemanV9>	Jobias: in the terminal, type lsb_release -a
01:45	<KyleK>	Jobias: its just an apt-get upgrade :p
01:45	<ubuntu__>	hi
01:45	<moveax>	KyleK: And dragging the file in resulted in the same 'Install OK' dialog, but no new theme.
01:45	<iznuics>	the_darkside_986: go to terminal and type top to see what's hogging the cpu
01:45	<Jobias>	hwilde: thanks
01:45	<moDumass>	Kylec, theyre the same thing - the old ones are metal and the new ones are plastic, thats the only difference
01:46	<DanaG>	!info htop
01:46	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 have you looked into 'tracker' ... it can hog resources ... it's the default indexing service for system wide searches .. you can throttle it
01:46	<ubotu>	htop (source: htop): interactive processes viewer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.6.6+svn20070915-1 (hardy), package size 45 kB, installed size 176 kB
01:46	<moDumass>	ppictures sti;; clog them though
01:46	<DanaG>	very handy tool: htop
01:46	<Jobias>	KyleK: ah, good to know :D
01:46	<duaneb>	DARN us.archive.ubuntu.com
01:46	<KyleK>	moveax: click customize, they didn't design it right
01:46	<jedimasterk>	I am having trouble using the live cd iso. When I boot I get (initramfs) blinking cursor. Tried to burns from two different mirrors. No luck. Should I try an upgrade from alternate cd instead.
01:46	<Jobias>	IcemanV9: thanks
01:46	<DanaG>	Find a different mirror.
01:46	<MentalNotes>	moveax: you might have to customize an existing theme
01:46	<rhanthony>	another question, does anyone know of a good ircd?
01:46	<iznuics>	duaneb: pick a mirror outside the country
01:46	<hwilde>	rhanthony, sudo aptitude search irc
01:46	<hwilde>	duaneb, use the git mirror its blazing
01:46	<_alf_>	is there a way to take an xubuntu install and turn it into a regular install of ubuntu (GNOME)? I tried removing xubuntu-desktop but all it did was drop a little 33K package.
01:46	<Starnestommy>	rhanthony: inspircd, hybrid, unreal, or ratbox
01:46	<DanaG>	Not necessary to go outside the country.
01:47	<rhanthony>	anyone have experience with some of those? personal opinions?
01:47	<the_darkside_986>	how do i throttle trackerd (is that its name?)
01:47	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 have you opened system monitor to see which running service seems to be using up you cpu resources
01:47	<bazhang>	_alf_: install ubuntu-desktop
01:47	<_alf_>	bazhang: thanks
01:47	<iznuics>	_alf_: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.. then change sessions on the login screen
01:47	<nickrud>	_alf_ install ubuntu-desktop , it'll install alongside. Use options->sessions on the login screen to choose which to run
01:47	<rhanthony>	never run an ircd, wanna try so i can put chat rooms up for some of my sites
01:47	<bazhang>	xchat rhanthony
01:47	<hwilde>	rhanthony, why not use freenode it's free
01:47	<the_darkside_986>	well, the only CPU % that isn't 0 is gnome-system-monitor and firefox. but it lags without firefox or sysmonitor running
01:47	<rhanthony>	hwilde: cause, i also want to just learn how to run an ircd.
01:48	<MentalNotes>	 the_darkside_986: go to system ->	preferences ->	Search and Indexing
01:48	<sammy>	_alf_: also there's an apt-get command that cleans out unused packages. it's possible you have an unbelievable amount of dependencies that aren't needed. try apt-get autoclean
01:48	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 it should be an icon in your notification area ... right click and look through preferences ... you can also access it through System/Preferences/SearchandIndexing
01:48	<shadeofgrey>	has anyboidy gotten full 8.04 to boot on intel macs in livCD mode?
01:48	<pure`eigenVector>	when distro-upgrading (from gutsy) with the alternate cd, is it safe to upgrade by mounting the iso, or do I have to burn it?
01:48	<iznuics>	the_darkside_986: trackerd might just be indexing.. when it's done all will be well.
01:48	<hwilde>	rhanthony, sudo aptitude search irc
01:48	<the_darkside_986>	ok
01:48	<rhanthony>	i've always go out and figured out how to DO the things I like using on the net... its how I started off, and why I am now a network engineer :P curiosity and not taking "no, normal people can't do that" as an answer
01:48	<the_darkside_986>	what do i do in the tracker preferences dialog?
01:48	<_alf_>	sammy: thanks... i'll try that too.
01:48	<sammy>	_alf_: I mean autoremove. autoclean deletes package files
01:48	<KyleK>	pure`eigenVector: why does upgrading involve a cd?
01:48	<Starnestommy>	rhanthony: I think ircd-hybrid is in the repos, but I prefer inspircd althopugh it has to be compiled from source
01:49	<Starnestommy>	*although
01:49	<pure`eigenVector>	KyleK... update servers are slow are really slow atm
01:49	<moveax>	KyleK: OK, so that resolved the controls - but the window borders aren't as they should be
01:49	<KyleK>	ah
01:49	<rhanthony>	Normal people shouldn't run a home network on a CISCO cat 6509 ... but it's one hell of a way to learn about networking :P
01:49	<MentalNotes>	 the_darkside_986: click on performance tab and move adjust the throttling option
01:49	<sammy>	rhanthony: yes, normal people should, and the other people should be relegated to the 'AOL' internet where you can't break anything.
01:49	<DanaG>	USE OTHER MIRRORS!
01:49	<_alf_>	how do i specify the "git mirror" that hwlide spoke of, since the us ubuntu archive is getting railed?
01:49	<KyleK>	pure`eigenVector: oh, right, I upgraded last night when people were asking when it was going to go live
01:49	<duaneb>	Guys: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors
01:49	<dabbill>	I have my driver set to nvidia in xorg.conf but when i try to run nvidia-settings it says i am not useing the nvidia driver
01:49	<rhanthony>	I just never got 100% into linux... was an NT guy for years and years... now going to roll up my sleeves and play with linux more than just as a bind/mail/apache server.
01:49	<xif>	can I install FF3 along-side FF2?
01:49	<moveax>	KyleK: ah, resolved that too, n/m :)
01:50	<DanaG>	Look between these two:
01:50	<the_darkside_986>	ok thanks. What about extremely slow startup time? Is there a way to fix that?

01:50	<duaneb>	whoops
01:50	<duaneb>	sorry, #ubuntu :P
01:50	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 ... just change the settings to use less memory and choose slow indexing over faster indexing ...  you can turn off tracker in Sessions

01:50	<Lucroth_>	I have a question
01:50	<rhanthony>	sammy: well, if you have a 6509 or 7501 cisco sitting in your living room for your home network... you're not "normal" anymore.
01:50	<shadeofgrey>	we need a ubuntu channel for mac people
01:50	<Lucroth_>	What changes in this new update
01:50	<compengi>	i'm facing a problem with my vga after installing hardy. it's Nvidia FX5500. i installed the restricted drivers and after reboot the resolution went to 640x480.
01:50	<DanaG>	6509 and 7501?  Managed switches?  Servers?  What?.
01:50	<Lucroth_>	Why should I bother?
01:51	<the_darkside_986>	oh ok. so tracker affects boot time? if that's the case then I guess I've fixed things.
01:51	<trobos>	Anyone have any idea why a wifi card would work with Ubuntu, but occasionally disconnect?
01:51	<tanlaan>	Hello everyone, I'm having trouble updating my new install of Ubuntu 7.10
01:51	<rhanthony>	DanaG: swtiches.  search the model numbers on www.cisco.com .... lil heftier than what you get at bestbuy.
01:51	<bazhang>	this is ubuntu support channel lucroth do you have a support question
01:51	<MP2E>	Ok seriously I'm stumped... This thing won't install ubuntu. Or most linuxes for that matter
01:51	<phiqtion>	how can i enable the 3d cube in HARDY? thx
01:51	<DanaG>	All I use is a dd-wrt router.
01:51	<binarybandit>	trobos, are you sure it's a client side issue?

01:52	<sammy>	for anyone else looking for mirrors, synaptic does a great job of pinging all the mirrors and chosing the best one for you. I'll suggest it 'cause it worked well for me :) just select 'repositories' and find your way to select a new mirror, there'll be a button.

01:52	<pure`eigenVector>	is there an amd64 specific ubuntu channel?
01:52	<binarybandit>	hwilde, nifty
01:52	<anathematic>	hwilde: not quite the newest, thanks!
01:52	<MP2E>	Yeah SiS really does suck
01:52	<smick>	with the new release, are the dual screen configurations any easier than like a month ago?
01:52	<pen>	bazhang: they now provide the GUI, but it's also confusing to use
01:52	<bazhang>	Lucroth_: go to www.fsckin.com for more info thanks
01:52	<nickrud>	pure`eigenVector you're in it
01:52	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 I don't think tracker affects boot time ... you can even set it to delay initiation by however long you wish from within its preferences ... my experience is that the compisite window manager takes some time to completely initiate after log on
01:52	<Lucroth_>	Im just curious as to if this newest ubuntu update is worth the hassle of gettting?

01:52	<pure`eigenVector>	nickrud: o_O oh okay... thanks
01:52	<phiqtion>	binarybandit: how can i get this?
01:52	<MP2E>	I thought Ubutnu supported SiS >_>
01:52	<bazhang>	pen never used it sorry
01:52	<sammy>	smick: as long as we're still using X, I doubt the dual screen configuration will be any easier in this decade :)
01:52	<boolka>	how do i turn on svideo output on my laptop? ( the function key + f4  dont work - did in windows) ?

01:53	<jedimasterk>	 I am having trouble using the live cd iso. When I boot I get (initramfs) blinking cursor. Tried to burns from two different mirrors. No luck. Should I try an upgrade from alternate cd instead.
01:53	<pure`eigenVector>	thanks, I just assumed there would be a separate channel
01:53	<phiqtion>	binarybandit: thx
01:53	<binarybandit>	jedimasterk, did you verify your burn?
01:53	<newscane>	i partitioned w/ debian sarge, grabbed ubuntu's debootstrap, and then i get errors when i run it
01:53	<smick>	sammy: thanks.  too bad. well Iwas gonna upgrade anywya, but I won't boot into ubuntu tonight and do it then.
01:53	<jedimasterk>	Yes
01:53	<bazhang>	jedimasterk: what about a net upgrade
01:53	<MP2E>	Does ubuntu support SiS?
01:53	<iznuics>	jedimasterk: you have to burn s.l.o.w.
01:53	<newscane>	it can't do chroot /target
01:53	<binarybandit>	jedimasterk, net upgrade?
01:53	<DanaG>	glxinfo → *segfault*
01:53	<jedimasterk>	didn't try that was slow
01:53	<lirit>	after i inserted the install CD, it wont ask me to upgrade, it only open the CD to show me the content. How can I get it to intall?
01:53	<DanaG>	Yay, I have a working fn-f4.  I'm lucky!
01:53	<binarybandit>	jedimasterk, well, if it verified, it should be ok
01:53	<plik>	jedimasterk: did you use the force?
01:54	<MP2E>	Does ubuntu support SiS? >_>
01:54	<bazhang>	lirit: in windows? what cd is this
01:54	<compengi>	Hello LjL-Temp
01:54	<mojo>	greets!  i just did a fresh install of 8.04RC the other day and can't find a good howto on dual monitors for hardy.  all the ones i find are very old.  the screen res tool is not detecting the 2nd monitor, using fglrx with compiz; 2nd monitor is working as a sort of clone but not at same res so it scrolls the viewport.  Help/ideas?
01:54	<Millertime_018>	my updates keep failing in the new ubuntu
01:54	<Millertime_018>	what do i do?
01:54	<binarybandit>	I usually burn at like 2x when I'm burning OSs ?.?
01:54	<sammy>	smick: X configuration with even one monitor and a good 'ol FOSS driver supported video card is a chore enough. it *is* better than it was last decade, though :D
01:54	<jedimasterk>	I rebooted and got (initramfs)_ prompt both times
01:54	<lirit>	bazhang: in linux 7.10. the cd is 8.04
01:54	<dabbill>	any one get a 8800 GT working in hardy that can help me out?
01:54	<DanaG>	How would you go about saying this to the nvidia driver:
01:54	<oddalot>	does anyone here have the emerald repository tab missing in emerald settings???
01:54	<rhanthony>	thanks guys... i've got what i needed for now... thanks agian for the help.
01:54	<jedimasterk>	I rebooted and got (initramfs)_ prompt both times  With Live CD
01:54	<smick>	sammy: but not better than 4 weeks ago, which is my last upgrade and last time I booted into ubuntu.
01:55	<KyleK>	oh good
01:55	<bazhang>	lirit the live cd or the alternate--what is the exact issue please be precise
01:55	<DanaG>	Assume ANY VGA monitor is capable of at least 1024x768 at 60Hz
01:55	<KyleK>	no updates since 22nd
01:55	<DanaG>	.... since some projectors are missing Pin 9 (the DDC Pin).
01:55	<smick>	I'm running a new 8800 GT video card on a new system.  so far, nvidia settings aren't working too well.
01:55	<jedimasterk>	Never had this problem with 7.10 Live cd
01:55	<oddalot>	no one here is using emerald on 8.04?
01:55	<jcwilliams>	smick: I am having issues with an 8800 GT as well.  I can't even get the live cd to boot
01:56	<ahave>	hello, i am tring to run 'apt-get install build-essential' and the build hangs at '99% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.92.2)]' and just sits there.. what is going on?
01:56	<sammy>	smick: thank you, nvidia and ati, for thinking that a closed source world is the best answer to innovation and progress. easily half of the questions I see for linux are 'my video is f'd up!' just 'cause there's so much pressure for one to be better than the other.
01:56	<lirit>	bazhang: the live cd. it asked me to install from the CD the very first time I inserted it. But after that, it only shows me the contents.
01:56	<hwilde>	ahave, you know everybody is upgrading to 8.04 right?
01:56	<bazhang>	ahave servers are understandably overworked
01:56	<DanaG>	I'll be switching TO ATI in summer, frankly.
01:56	<LainIwakura>	I could configur my wireless (Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI) connection in Gutsy by installing the broadcom firmwire, then enabling it in "Restricted Driver Manager". Now in Hardy, after I install the firmwire, I cannot locate the firmwire in "Driver Manager" (there is no "Restricted Driver Manager" anymore) in order to enable it. Any ideas? Thanks.

01:56	<ahave>	hwilde, oh.. did not know that.. should i just let it sit?
01:56	<bazhang>	lirit you need to disable the cd as a software source in synpatic
01:56	<compengi>	i'm facing a problem with my vga after installing hardy. it's Nvidia FX5500. i installed the restricted drivers and after reboot the resolution went to 640x480. could anyone help me out?
01:56	<sammy>	ahave: have you tried running synaptic package manager and having it look for the closest mirror to you? that helped for me.
01:56	<DanaG>	nvidia is closed-source crap.
01:57	<hwilde>	ahave, you should go outside and get some exercise and come back tomorrow
01:57	<ledbettj>	LainIwakura:  the "Restricted Manager" got renamed to "Driver Manager" at least on my machine
01:57	<ahave>	sammy, no i have not.
01:57	<sileni>	why does apt-get update stop at 56 % getting headers
01:57	<smallfoot->	yes but nvidia drivers work better than all other
01:57	<sjovan>	hey guys... i think i made a pritty useful script for splitting movies. how do you get it on the official wiki?
01:57	<hwilde>	sileni, , you know everybody is upgrading to 8.04 right?
01:57	<ahave>	hwilde, i am backpacking tomorrow :p
01:57	<smallfoot->	sileni, heavy load due to 8.04 release
01:57	<ledbettj>	LainIwakura: er, I mean "Hardware Drivers"
01:57	<sileni>	i seeee

02:04	<mojo>	greets!  i just did a fresh install of 8.04RC the other day and can't find a good howto on dual monitors for hardy.  all the ones i find are very old.  the screen res tool is not detecting the 2nd monitor, using fglrx with compiz; 2nd monitor is working as a sort of clone but not at same res so it scrolls the viewport.  Help/ideas?
02:04	<k[5\5]>	help upgrade 710 to 804 ..
02:04	<jcwilliams>	I need help getting the Live CD to boot.  My Monitor hits sleep mode and my computer just beeps
02:04	<graft>	telexicon: and way too much for a stupid network manager to take up
02:04	<telexicon>	graft, xorg is highly optimized
02:04	<k[5\5]>	update manager no response
02:04	<graft>	telexicon: and network manager is not?
02:04	<philip__>	lol!
02:04	<telexicon>	no network manager is not
02:04	<NAiL>	Any Xen gurus here? Having some issues with Xen after upgrading to Hardy :(
02:04	<Miss_Adriana_Ber>	let me see
02:05	<graft>	telexicon: well, balls
02:05	<CJS3141>	In Synaptic what exactly is the difference between "Mark for removal" and "Mark for complete removal"?
02:05	<GerbilSoft>	i seem to have encountered a strange bug in ubuntu 8.04's NFS booting
02:05	<bazhang>	graft: it is the size it is; I prefer to uninstall it and use command line--you are free to do so as well
02:05	<oriez>	after upgrading i don't have sound at all
02:05	<GerbilSoft>	specifically, after it boots from the network, it freezes after loading squashfs
02:05	<philip__>	lol, wtf?!
02:05	<the_darkside_986>	why does my whole system keep lagging randomly when I'm running only firefox and chatzilla. (well the system claims a package manager is running ...)?
02:05	<GerbilSoft>	it won't unfreeze unless you wait a few minutes, press Ctrl-N, and hit enter
02:05	<jon_high9000>	hello, anybody know of anything strange going on this afternoon such as  failure to access repositories?
02:05	<bazhang>	CJS3141: unisintall and purge
02:05	<Daedius_>	this is taking a bit to get it into pastebin FYI
02:05	<ben-g>	how do i enable my atheros wifi card?
02:05	<graft>	bazhang: comamdnline you mean like if-up etc?
02:05	<Daedius_>	;))
02:05	<seamus7>	CJS3141 mark for complete removal deletes the configuration files (I think that's the only difference)
02:05	<telexicon>	the_darkside_986, i think there is a bug in firefox that the devs are ignoring
02:05	<Johnson>	whee install cd keeps saying I have logic errors lol, i can't even check disk integrity
02:06	<bazhang>	graft: command line (cli)
02:06	<InYourBase>	jon_high9000: The traffic is really high because so many people are updating
02:06	<graft>	jon_high9000: hardy was just released, load is high, try a mirror
02:06	<telexicon>	firefox freaks out and eats up 70% cpu and thrashes the hard drive often
02:06	<oddalot>	lol
02:06	<newscane>	i'm having some problems with an install of gutsy over floppies (boot from sarge floppies, then grabbing ubuntu's debootstrap)...
02:06	<sammy>	milly1234: mojo: you're probably on your own, more or less. dual monitor setups are almost always completely different as someone else's, they're really hard to debug and troubleshoot.
02:06	<twinkie_addict>	thats why i run opera :)
02:06	<graft>	bazhang: yes, do you mean using ifup eth0, and /etc/network/interfaces? that's too 1990s for me
02:06	<telexicon>	graft, where are you looking at the memory usage?
02:06	<graft>	telexicon: top
02:06	<ubuntu__>	how do i become an ubuntu guru?
02:06	<vi1985>	bazhang: I don't have too much experience setting up os's... When installing Hardy, it prompted me to repartition the hard drive so that space will be allocated to both windows and ubuntu... now when i tried to do it, it threw some unspecified error.
02:06	<sammy>	mojo: that being said, it sounds like you could make a change to your xorg.conf to fix that, have you edited it manually at all?
02:06	<telexicon>	graft, if i look under system manager it shows 2.3MB for network manager
02:06	<Daedius_>	Alright you guys
02:06	<CJS3141>	seamus7, bazhang: Thanks!
02:06	<Johnson>	ubuntu__, lmfao
02:06	<milly1234>	this isn't dual monitor
02:06	<telexicon>	graft, er system monitor
02:06	<jon_high9000>	graft: i tried to load the 7.10 version of Kubuntu
02:06	<mojo>	sammy::  no it is stock, and very sparse
02:06	<DBautell>	ubuntu__, practice
02:07	<bazhang>	graft if you have a support question please ask, otherwise please go to #ubuntu-offtopic thanks
02:07	<ubuntu__>	im an idiot
02:07	<sammy>	milly1234: sorry, don't know why your nick got stuck in there.
02:07	<k[5\5]>	help update manager  no response when update from 710 to 804??
02:07	<ubuntu__>	can it be done?
02:07	<dabbill>	Exodus, any idea man?
02:07	<vanzemaljac>	ikonia: helpp :)
02:07	<Daedius_>	here is my pastebin for usb mouse problems where the mouse only works for 3 seconds or so: http://pastebin.com/m18f296
02:07	<milly1234>	probably saw me having problems of a similer nature but only on one display
02:07	<bazhang>	vi1985: could you please specify the error? it would be very helpful
02:07	<niadh>	I've upgraded to hardy today and now my iPod does not work with banshee, what packages do i need to install to fix this?
02:07	<sammy>	k[5\5]: the mirrors are very heavily loaded. try running synaptic package manager and choosing a new mirror to download from in the repositories configuration.
02:07	<jon_high9000>	graft:had a large hang time. never did install.
02:07	<nickrud>	vi1985 try defragging your windows drive first. If you have vista, use the vista disk management tool to shrink your ntfs partition
02:07	<JoshBP>	My updater gets stuck on setting new software channels. It always quits with a network error, but it my network is fine
02:07	<tomtommy>	how do i upgrade to hardy?
02:07	<vanzemaljac>	ikonia: so i have ubuntu installed on laptop and i have a 22" flat LCD hooked up to it.. when i boot ubuntu with it pluged in.. it shows bunch of nonsesne million different colors.. any ida?
02:07	<Daisuke_Ido>	ubuntu__, you can do it, the quickest way to start is to hang out here and read through the forums
02:07	<vanzemaljac>	idea*?
02:08	<oddalot>	i feel naked and alone
02:08	<telexicon>	JoshBP, the mirrors are overloaded wait a while
02:08	<k[5\5]>	i've change the mirror to a fast edu net
02:08	<vanzemaljac>	anyone know
02:08	<Exodus>	dabbill: try this xorg.conf on hardy heron: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64299/
02:08	<Daisuke_Ido>	(i've been using ubuntu for a year and a half and i'm nowhere NEAR guru status)
02:08	<JoshBP>	how long.....
02:08	<graft>	jon_high9000: try a different mirror?
02:08	<vi1985>	bazhang, the only thing it lets me do is to either use the entire disc for linux, or create new partitions. Both options require format, which I'm very reluctant to do...
02:08	<nickrud>	tomtommy if you're in 7.10, it will ask you if you want to upgrade
02:08	<Exodus>	dabbill: remember to back up your xorg.conf
02:08	<sammy>	JoshBP: have you tried selecting a new mirror or are you using the default?
02:08	<telexicon>	JoshBP, or you can use an alternate mirror
02:08	<dabbill>	Exodus, aye :)
02:08	<vanzemaljac>	so i have ubuntu installed on laptop and i have a 22" flat LCD hooked up to it.. when i boot ubuntu with it pluged in.. it shows bunch of nonsesne million different colors.. any ida?
02:08	<k[5\5]>	and tried many times
02:08	<ubuntu__>	im downloading hardy now, going to format this 500 gigger and go crazy
02:08	<Daisuke_Ido>	JoshBP, til they aren't overloaded, that's how long :D
02:08	<Daisuke_Ido>	hard to say really
02:08	<sammy>	mojo: pastebin it somewhere, your xorg.conf - i'll take a look, no promises :P
02:08	<bazhang>	vi1985: you may consider wubi or unetbootin if you are wary of using partitioning tools then

02:09	<vanzemaljac>	does anyone know how to get external LCD working on ubuntu.. installed on a laptop
02:09	<sammy>	k[5\5]: try letting it auto-find the best mirror. i was skeptical, but it worked wonderfully
02:09	<bazhang>	ed1t: is that a real question?
02:09	<_alf_>	ubuntu__: i've used linux for 10 years. I use it every day at my job and at home and i'm not a guru
02:09	<ed1t>	figured
02:09	<nickrud>	ed1t try looking for a mirror near you
02:09	<dabbill>	Exodus, did you edit my config?
02:09	<sammy>	k[5\5]: also, assume that the fastest mirrors are the ones that are overloaded.
02:09	<ubuntu__>	well then im screwed!
02:09	<eternal_p>	there needs to be a drinking game, a shot when asked about the repos

02:10	<eternal_p>	flowbot: no, sorry
02:10	<ubuntu__>	i see the community is really cool though
02:10	<Exodus>	dabbill: yes, i posted that correction
02:10	<DBautell>	flowbot, #pidgin, that one's right in their topic
02:10	<Daedius_>	just for information on my non working usb mouse system, its a mac pro if that helps anyone
02:10	<Exodus>	dabbill: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64299/ this should automate certain things, and auto-detect.
02:11	<flowbot>	DBautell: is #pidgin on this server?
02:11	<IntangibleLiquid>	cool, i'm on Hardy now. What's next?

02:14	<KyleK>	hey will ubuntu install onto a raid now?
02:14	<c0mp13371331337_>	k[5\5]-  You'll need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change every instance of 'gutsy' to 'hardy'.
02:14	<MachinTrucChose>	anyone else have this problem? My wifi works, but after I reboot, it doesn't work. I'm thinking it's gotta be a permissions thing, I had the same problem in 7.10. I'm sure the fine people at Canonical didn't ship it with a Network-Manager that doesn't work with wifi cards, so can anyone recommend a fix (other than installing 3rd party apps like Wicd)
02:14	<Danikar>	Hey does Hardy have Firefox 3 Beta installed by default?

02:17	<Kr0ntab>	nownot: sudo apt-get purge phpmyadmin
02:17	<MachinTrucChose>	I thought Flash was supposed to work out-of-the-box on HH?
02:17	<jason>	i jsut downloaded the iso andi  have gustsy gibbon
02:17	<niadh>	_ZeuZ_: You mean XULRunner?
02:17	<sammy>	nownot: that should completely remove any files that you didn't create yourself. do you mean dependencies?
02:17	<JoshBP>	would the iso be quicker?
02:17	<_ZeuZ_>	niadh, yah, sorry typo
02:17	<telexicon>	tomd123, thats not an excuse, and i understand its beta.. but this is not just a little quirky issue, this is showstopper, making the whole system unusable, lag
02:17	<nownot>	sammy:  yes
02:17	<IntangibleLiquid>	how do I perform the 3-D cube thing?
02:17	<criminy>	!local
02:17	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about local - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
02:17	<newscane>	can someone help me w/ a floppy-based install?  booted from debian sarge floppies, now using debootstrap to get gutsy, and having problems.
02:17	<mijac>	even that the restricted drivers detect an atheros
02:17	<fevel>	i was using the betaversio nd it didnt ask me to upgrade
02:17	<rich_freecomm>	ug....at least THIS server knows my name....
02:17	<cal_>	where is the connection log for ubuntu? i dont see anything that would have to do with my broadband dsl connection in /var/log ... ?? I am losing connection every 10 min or so and need to track down the reason.
02:17	<corbett>	h
02:17	<Exodus>	dabbill: install the "nvidia-settings" package
02:17	<_ZeuZ_>	gotta go, take care guys
02:18	<tomd123>	telexicon: use firefox 2 / opera / epiphany if you don't like it, you have options you know
02:18	<telexicon>	id understand if it was alpha 4, but its beta 5
=== pj_og__ is now known as pj_og
02:18	<fevel>	how can I tell if If im using a  beta or not??
02:18	<mijac>	ok zeus
02:18	<dabbill>	Exodus, i have it installed
02:18	<KyleK>	uh
02:18	<P_Kable>	Hi, if sudo do-release-upgrade closed unexpectedly, what should I do to relaunch it ?
02:18	<ubuntu__>	says beta
02:18	<telexicon>	yea, that was the response i expected
02:18	<Exodus>	dabbill: well, is your monitor adequetly identified?
02:18	<KyleK>	telexicon: beta means beta not "works"
02:18	<rich_freecomm>	ok, well....I'm not impressed with IRC....It won't even let me use the name I registered yesterday
02:18	<eternal_p>	IntangibleLiquid: you need to install compiz advanced settings, then turn on cube and cube rotation
02:18	<sammy>	nownot: once you remove it, you can run apt-get autoremove. Kr0ntab suggested apt-get purge, I'm not sure if that does the same thing.
=== dny_ is now known as dny
02:19	<aeon17x>	holy crap @ crowd
02:19	<tomd123>	telexicon: as I said, you have options
02:19	<dabbill>	Exodus, nvidia-settings says i am not running the nvidia driver
02:19	<Exodus>	dabbill: run nvidia settings as root with sudo, and remember to save to xorg with it
02:19	<telexicon>	KyleK, beta means.. getting close to release candidates, trying to clean up the last few bugs
02:19	<KyleK>	telexicon: even 3.0 final no really it works (TM) is still not stable ;)
02:19	<IndyGunFreak>	aeon17x: always is on a new release day
02:19	<tomd123>	ahh aeon17x is throwing crap at the crowd!
02:19	<ANTDx1>	holy crap back, aeon17x
02:19	<aeon17x>	hola
02:19	<iznuics>	rich_freecomm: what happens when you /nick <registered nick>
02:19	<DBautell>	rich_freecomm, you're not using pidgin, are you?
02:19	<ubuntu__>	geez my connection is slow
02:19	<aeon17x>	haven't gotten the release yet, will do later tonight :-)
02:19	<ubuntu__>	another 3 hours before 8.04
02:19	<Vorbote>	﻿﻿MachinTrucChose: you probably have a corrupt keyring file. Go into single user mode (sudo telinit 1), change to your home directory (a "su - <yourlogin>" will do), change to .gnome2 and delete the keyrings directory. Reboot and try again. Allow network-manager to access the keyring always when asked. Don't login automatically to your account but login with your password. that'll open the keyring automatically.
02:19	<ANTDx1>	goodl uck...
02:19	<bazhang>	rich_freecomm: why not xchat?
02:19	<fiz1>	hey, i have hardy and i just installed firefox 2, it wont allow me to add any extensions
02:20	<dabbill>	Exodus, when i do sudo nvidia-settings it says " You do not appear to be useing the NVIDIA X driver. Please edit your X configuration file
02:20	<Exodus>	dabbill: you sure you have Driver "nvidia" on the device @ xorg.conf?
02:20	<Vorbote>	!es >	aeon17x
02:20	<IndyGunFreak>	ubuntu__: its probabl not your connection, the servers are overwhelmed right now
02:20	<sammy>	rich_freecomm: someone else is probably using it, and freenode doesn't automagically boot people for using someone else's nick until they ask for it back.
02:20	<nownot>	ok need some help phpmyadmin is not cooperating
02:20	<k[5\5]>	i think the only and safe way is to click the "update" button on the update manager
02:20	<dabbill>	Exodus, i am useing the xorg.conf file you pastbin and said to use
02:20	<ubuntu__>	no trust me my connection is crap
02:20	<ubuntu__>	im getting 50-66kb
02:20	<IndyGunFreak>	ok, if you say so.
02:20	<MachinTrucChose>	vorbote: I always log in with a password. I'll do the rest of your recommendations. Thanks.
02:20	<ubuntu__>	normally i get 70
02:20	<ubuntu__>	;-)
02:20	<twinkie_addict>	oh yes the torent is much faster
02:20	<ubuntu__>	but your probably right, a lot of people hitting them hard
02:21	<rich_freecomm>	iznuics: (on that server) rich_freecomm :Nickname is already in use.
02:21	<Exodus>	dabbill: hmm, I think I found the error from your xorg.conf
02:21	<dracflamloc>	﻿quick question, ﻿the applications menu... is there any way to make the items in the menu vertically smaller? i like small menus...
02:21	<Exodus>	dabbill: let me see.
02:21	<goat|work>	is there a "replace" option in any of the terminal text editors,  i cant find one in nano, does vi or emacs have one?  I'm trying to replace a string with another string in 30 locations in a file
02:21	<nownot>	looks like its in /usr/share how do i access it from locahost?
02:21	<k[5\5]>	...now i 'm changing gutsy to hardy
02:21	<Schalken>	!upgrade
02:21	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
02:21	<dabbill>	Exodus, okay cool.
02:21	<rich_freecomm>	DBautell: I'm using X-chat right now...but I have pidgin loaded
02:21	<k[5\5]>	manually
02:21	<rich_freecomm>	sammy: even after I registered it?
02:21	<nickrud>	rich_freecomm if you have the nick registered, do /nicksrerv ghost nick password
02:21	<Gman99999>	is there a default laptop powersaver utility for chagning the frequency of the processor installed in ubuntu by default like there is in kde?
02:21	<DBautell>	rich_freecomm, yeah, ok, pidgin sucks at IRC. try /ghost NAME pwd
02:21	<nickrud>	rich_freecomm er, nickserv , a typo there
02:21	<iznuics>	ubuntu__: I've got a good connection and only getting 80kbs .. normally on the mirrors I get in the hundreds.. it's just a busy day!
02:21	<welshdrago1>	anybody know how to get wireless working in hardy with an Atheros AR242x? i have the drivers, but no connections show
02:22	<sammy>	rich_freecomm: it's a setting each irc network can choose for themselves. some of them do, some of them don't, even after you registered it.
02:22	<bazhang>	welshdrago1: does ifconfig show three entries or two
02:22	<crimsun>	telexicon: bug 215728
02:22	<iznuics>	rich_freecomm: what nick did you register?
02:22	<thenetduck>	Hi can someone help me understand Landscape?
02:22	<telexicon>	crimsun, yeah im reading it
02:22	<sammy>	rich_freecomm: you can always ask for it back when you log in, which is what I've been doing for.. however many years now :)
02:22	<Gman99999>	anyway to change your processor performance levels on a laptop in gnome in ubuntu?
02:22	<welshdrago1>	bazhang: 2 secs...
02:22	<niadh>	Does anyone know why my iPod might not work with banshee after upgrading to hardy, despite me having podsluth installed?
02:22	<Arnos>	Does anyone know how long it should take to load 8.04 from USB?
02:22	<ubuntu__>	well thanks IZNUICS makes me feel better.
02:23	<kneeki>	*wave*
02:23	<iznuics>	ubuntu__: :)
02:23	<Exodus>	dabbill: no it's actually we constructed, run "lsmod | grep vidia" in a console, does anythin appear?
02:23	<bazhang>	niadh: amarok works fine here; never tried banshee though
02:23	<keenish27>	anyone know how to get dual displays working on hardy?
02:23	<welshdrago1>	bazhang: 2
02:23	<niadh>	bazhang: Not a great KDE fan, hence the banshee thing
02:23	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger,
02:23	<rich_freecomm>	nickrud: well..now the account was killed...of course I assume that killed my OP for the channel as well
02:23	<Millertime_018>	bazhang: i cant get any updates or new installs cuz the downloading stops at a certain file number! what should i do?
02:23	<telexicon>	this is an unfortunate situation for the default browser for an LTS release to be in
02:23	<bjbum>	anyone have experience with running vent through wine? i've got most things working except I can only hear 1 voice at a time >.<
02:23	<bazhang>	welshdrago1: is that the one that uses madwifi
02:23	<dbristow>	damn it, I keep getting a md5sum mismatch on wubi.exe, I get three identical copies of the file from major mirrors, yet the same mirrors MD5SUMS lists a different md5sum for just that file, all the *.isos are fine
02:23	<mgmz>	hi, anyone know if i can run wine with "hotspot shield" or know a similar linux prog???????
02:23	<shadfc>	can i use the 8.04 CD to upgrade
02:24	<nownot>	??
02:24	<niadh>	shadfc: Yes
02:24	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, yt?
02:24	<twinkie_addict>	nice 504 k trandsfer :)
02:24	<nickrud>	rich_freecomm doesn't kill the account, just the user of the nick. then you can /nick nick, and then /nickserv password <pass>
02:24	<kneeki>	This is a tad silly, but how do I go about getting all 4 desktops (for my cube) to show? Atm, I only have 2 desktops, and the cube looks all flat, like a piece of paper. =p
02:24	<KyleK>	telexicon: better than LTS being stuck with firefox 2 for a long time
02:24	<fevel>	hey... how cn I update my beta hardy?
02:24	<Millertime_018>	kneeki: right click the windows that are already there
02:24	<iznuics>	shadfc: just the alternate from what I've read
02:24	<freeksh0w86>	hmm, everytime i launch a new process, the CPU goes crazy and everything lags including basic mouse movement. what could possibly be the cause of this?
02:24	<Gman99999>	anyway to change your processor performance levels on a laptop in gnome in ubuntu?
02:24	<Whtiger>	ind1g0zzling: ..what?
02:24	<bazhang>	niadh: kde apps run fine in gnome; gtkpod or rhythmbox should do well in gnome though if you are a purist
02:24	<KyleK>	kneeki: turn on more virtual desktops probably
02:24	<MachinTrucChose>	what are the best IRC clients for Linux? Pidgin is horrible, it's like the absolute bare minimum required to use IRC.
02:24	<nownot>	ok need some help phpmyadmin is not cooperating  looks like its in /usr/share how do i access it from locahost?
02:24	<telexicon>	KyleK, right, browser that doesnt work instead of old browser
02:24	<nickrud>	fevel just start the upgrade-manager
02:24	<ubuntu__>	what distribution of linux do corporations use for servers?
02:25	<telexicon>	makes sense to me
02:25	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, wtf... goddamnit #googoog
02:25	<kneeki>	oh?
02:25	<Vorbote>	kneeki: right-click on the workspaces applet and edit the preferences.
02:25	<dabbill>	Exodus, no i dont see nvidia under lsmod
02:25	<dbristow>	MachinTrucChose: I like xchat
02:25	<mgmz>	synaptic is not working, how come i cant fetch any files????????????????????
02:25	<nickrud>	nownot  go to localhost/phpmyadmin , you should see it
02:25	<sammy>	ubuntu__: redhat and those with 'certifications' because corporations like little sheets of paper
02:25	<supersako>	i am trying to dual boot and virtualize... basically i want to have windows vista and linux dual booted and then in linux be able to open windows in a VM or boot into Windows if i have to...
02:25	<keenish27>	anyone know how to get dual displays working in hardy?
02:25	<mgmz>	ahh
02:25	<DBautell>	MachinTrucChose, xchat
02:25	<niadh>	Bazhang: Not a purest, i use K3b more than gnome burners, but banshee is prefered media player
02:25	<KyleK>	telexicon: what is your problem anyways? I'm only havign issues with its autocompletion, brings up porn to the top all the time :(
02:25	<welshdrago1>	bazhang: i didn't know madwifi supported hardy?
02:25	<kneeki>	Ah ha! That was it =p
02:25	<iznuics>	ubuntu__: red hat, suse, ubuntu (up and coming)
02:25	<Whtiger>	ind1g0zzling: why didn't you just pm me?
02:25	<jordanjay21>	mgmz: it's probably slow, just keep trying or wait
02:25	<kneeki>	I knew it was something horribly simple
02:25	<corbett>	hi, is there anyone who can help me get my maxtor external hard drive mounted and working on ububtu 7.10 - whicj ive just loaded on pc to replace windows, it worked perfectly fine elsewhere on widowqs
02:25	<nownot>	nickrud: yeah its not htere
02:25	<mgmz>	j
02:25	<mgmz>	kk
02:25	<fevel>	nickrud,  It says the system is up to date,  but firefox is still beta
02:25	<c0mp13371331337_>	MachinTrucChose-  BitchX is nice, if you're a fan of the command line.
02:25	<goat|work>	anyone know of a "find and replace" option in any of the terminal text editors,  i cant find one in nano, does vi or emacs have one?  I'm trying to replace a string with another string in 30 locations in a file
02:25	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, #googoog for explanation lol
02:25	<jordanjay21>	mgmz: I had the same problem a few minutes ago
02:25	<KyleK>	MachinTrucChose: I'm using irssi :)
02:25	<ubuntu__>	stupid little pieces of paper
02:25	<mgmz>	okay
02:25	<telexicon>	KyleK, it eats up 70% CPU and thrashes the disk a ton, making my whole system unusably slow
02:25	<nickrud>	nownot is the config in /etc/apache2/conf.d ?
02:25	<twinkie_addict>	irssi is my fave
02:25	<Arnos>	If I had to use the alternate installer to install to USB can that make my desktop not load fully?
02:25	<Vorbote>	MachinTrucChose: irssi sets the bar for the terminal and x-chat for the graphical desktop IMO.
02:25	<ubuntu__>	oh so they actually do use ubuntu?
02:25	<dracflamloc>	again.. ?? ﻿quick question, ﻿the applications menu... is there any way to make the items in the menu vertically smaller? i like small menus...
02:25	<sjovan>	hey, som one got a linux wiki to recomend? i have a howto on how to split movies with mplayer and made a script to make it easyer, and a howto take X screenshots of a movie, put it to gether on X colums on a picture (an some other functions)  and made an enhacment for the vcs-script to do that.
02:26	<KyleK>	telexicon: cool
02:26	<Jack_Sparrow>	nickrud, howdy, for password I use.. recover then release then identify...
02:26	<nickrud>	fevel firefox is beta, till june or so
02:26	<rich_freecomm>	nickrud: -NickServ- [rich_freecomm] has been killed
02:26	<rich_freecomm>	--- rich_freecomm :Nickname is already in use.
02:26	<MachinTrucChose>	comp: thanks, but no thanks. I'll go with DB's recommendation ;)
02:26	<rich_freecomm>	*slap to niggin*
02:26	<Danaman5>	Does anyone know why there are a bunch of update packages that I still can't download?
02:26	<KyleK>	goat|work: vi does, dunno how to do it, also theres always using sed
02:26	<nickrud>	Jack_Sparrow you know more than I do, rich_freecomm talk to Jack_Sparrow
02:26	<_alf_>	telexicon: how much ram do you have total?
02:26	<k[5\5]>	!wow I like this place!
02:26	<iznuics>	ubuntu__: starting to .. trying to get sun certification or something like that.
02:26	<jordanjay21>	any good GUI-based Irc clients?
02:26	<Gman99999>	anyway to change your processor performance levels on a laptop in gnome in ubuntu?
02:26	<Whtiger>	ind1g0zzling: no?
02:26	<telexicon>	_alf_, its not swapping
02:26	<freeksh0w86>	everytime i launch a new process, the CPU goes crazy and everything lags including basic mouse movement. what could possibly be the cause of this?
02:26	<jedimasterk>	 I am having trouble using the live cd iso. When I boot I get (initramfs) blinking cursor. Tried to burns from two different mirrors. No luck. Should I try an upgrade from alternate cd instead.
02:26	<ubuntu__>	i see
02:26	<telexicon>	_alf_, it does it on every page, even if i just leave it on google after a while it starts up
02:26	<nownot>	nickrud:  yes there is a file named that
02:26	<niadh>	jordanjay21: XChat is good enough
02:26	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, wait... you know who this is right? This is... Josh, amirite
02:26	<Exodus>	dabbill: that means your nvidia driver isn't loading
02:26	<_alf_>	telexicon: it is strange behavior
02:27	<samalex>	hey guys ..  anyone else installing Ubuntu 8.04 right now ? :)
02:27	<rconan>	what's the deal with the missing dmraid package on the mirrors?
02:27	<ubuntu__>	what did ubuntu use for a browser before firefox?
02:27	<sammy>	jedimasterk: isn't there a 'verify this cd' option on the boot splash of the cd? that should be an easier way to verfity your cd. and, yes, you apparently *have* to upgrade from the alternate cd
02:27	<_alf_>	telexicon: did you do a fresh install?
02:27	<nickrud>	nownot and when you point the browser at http://localhost/phpmyadmin you don't see it?
02:27	<jordanjay21>	niadh: I didn't mean good "enough" :P
02:27	<Meshezabeel>	no more #ubuntu+1 :(
02:27	<Exodus>	dabbill: reinstall your nvidia-glx-new package
02:27	<iznuics>	samalex: probably half the room or more..
02:27	<Whtiger>	ind1g0zzling: yes, why are you bugging me in here instead of.. you know.. pm
02:27	<c0mp13371331337_>	samalex-  I'm apt-getting the dist-upgrade right now.
02:27	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, God damnit. I've been sending PMs to you for the past three hours only to realize that unregistered users can't send PMs because I wasn't checking the server messages LOL
02:27	<jedimasterk>	I did verify it
02:27	<telexicon>	_alf_, people are noting that firefox is clobbering urlclassifier.sqlite
02:27	<jordanjay21>	niadh: I meant "good" as in brilliant.
02:27	<KyleK>	haha
02:27	<KyleK>	jedimasterk: downloaded the same iso twice? thats what checking the md5sum is for ;)
02:27	<KyleK>	jedimasterk: and yea alternate cd sometimes help
02:27	<niadh>	jordanjay21: Pidgin does the job too, but complicated, versus xchat
02:27	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, thought you were AFK
02:27	<ubuntu__>	hahaha
02:27	<samalex>	I'm installing 8.04 server, and I guess TONS of folks are running updates as hitting the apt-get mirror during install took forever.
02:27	<Jack_Sparrow>	rich_freecomm,    /nickserv help               look at recover then release  before you try to re-identify.. make sure you dont have another instance of your chat client open on another side of the cube etc..
02:27	<KyleK>	recent xchats suck i thought
02:27	<Millertime_018>	can anyone tell me how to view the driver thats being used for my wireless card?
02:27	<k[5\5]>	<jordanjay21>	,x
02:28	<nownot>	nickrud:  that is correct
02:28	<Arnos>	Whats different about the alternate CD?
02:28	<doug2266778822>	what do i need to install to use gdm themes off gnome look im on hardy gnome.
02:28	<c0mp13371331337_>	samalex-  Yeah, that's usually what happens on Ubuntu Day.
02:28	<Millertime_018>	can anyone tell me how to view the drive thats being used for my wireless card?
02:28	<nickrud>	nownot try restarting apache
02:28	<Whtiger>	ind1g0zzling: sounds like user error.
02:28	<niadh>	Arnos: Command line install i think
02:28	<Odd-rationale>	!alternative | Arnos
02:28	<ubotu>	Arnos: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
02:28	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, indeed.
02:28	<telexicon>	_alf_, no, ive been running the beta.. and just updating, but two days ago i purged firefox-3.0, xulrunner, flash, and reinstalled them.. it still does this even with a new profile and no add-ons or flash
02:28	<dabbill>	Exodus, okay removed it and reinstalled, gonna reboot
02:28	<ind1g0zzling>	Whtiger, is Matt on?
02:28	<samalex>	c0mp13371331337_: I had just installed 7.10 on my home server 2 days ago (new install), so went ahead and started from scratch.
02:28	<jedimasterk>	Checked modsum and burned two different iso's everything was fine
02:28	<Whtiger>	ind1g0zzling: ..pm me =\ this really isn't the place.
02:28	<Arnos>	would useing the alternate CD be likly to help my problem of 8.04 not loading from USB?
02:28	<_alf_>	telexicon: then you've checked everything i could possibly blame
02:29	<Gman99999>	anyway to change your processor performance levels on a laptop in gnome in ubuntu?
02:29	<ubuntu__>	so to those that use linux daily whats your take on this hardy 8.04?
02:29	<GhostShell>	hi, happy ubuntu upgrade day everyone :D
02:29	<Odd-rationale>	Arnos: boot from usb?
02:29	<freeksh0w86>	I have trackerd essentially disabled, but everytime i launch a new process, the CPU goes crazy and everything lags including basic mouse movement. what could possibly be the cause of this? does anyone else experience this issue? i'm going to buy a system with a quad-core CPU eventually for this.
02:29	<Danaman5>	Why are there so many upgrade packages that I can't install?
02:29	<jedimasterk>	Never had problems with Live CD's in the past
02:29	<jordanjay21>	ubuntu__: that'd be better question for #ubuntu-offtopic
02:29	<Arnos>	Yes, you can put Ubuntu on a USB
02:29	<Jack_Sparrow>	ubuntu__, discussion in #Ubuntu-offtopic thanks.. this is the support room
02:29	<Odd-rationale>	Arnos: you wish to install from USB?
02:29	<nownot>	nickrud:  didnt work
02:29	<samalex>	ubuntu__: I use Ubuntu Server daily, and it's nice ... butyou're probably looking for Desktop users :)
02:29	<ANTDx1>	ubuntu__, i havent had a chance to use it yet.

02:29	<Arnos>	no, I installed to USB
02:29	<isdepopecath>	Hi, I have a question about switiching to Ubuntu. I'm a long time Windows user, so am hesitant about changing my OS. I'd like to download Ubuntu and try it out, but my only current machine is my laptop, running Vista. Is there any way for me to install Ubuntu, try it, and, if I don't like it, go back to my original OS without losing anything?
02:29	<CaptainMorgan>	just attempted to start the install... it hangs after making a selection from the install menu right after startup.... is this a hardware issue? supposedly Hardy heron has already run smooth on other's systems identical to mine... maybe the CD is bad? no matter which option is chosen from the menu it's as if the CD drive stops working(which I know works fine otherwise) and then nothing happens and also I can't make another sele
02:29	<Arnos>	from the CD
02:29	<iznuics>	ubuntu__: if it's anything like the last LTS version (Dapper Drake 6.06) it'll be just fine..
02:29	<nickrud>	nownot a sec while I check my install
02:29	<Gman99999>	it seems to work faster on my laptop
02:29	<black_13>	is bad if the install of ubuntu server is stuck at 40% (scanning mirror) ?
02:29	<c0mp13371331337_>	samalex-  Yeah, I'm TRYING the dist-upgrade method.  It's never worked for me in the past, not once, but I figure it's got to one of these times.... ;-)

02:30	<jordanjay21>	isdepopecath: try wubi, it's on the Ubuntu 8.04 live disc
02:30	<Odd-rationale>	Arnos: probably the alt cd will not do much better.

02:30	<ubuntu__>	wow i got more then i bargined for :(
02:30	<Arnos>	now I am trying to boot from just the USB.  I can login but then it just shows the background and nevers gets to the desktop
02:30	<Zelta>	the day people start recommending wubi is the day I...
02:30	<deadend>	ubuntu__: So far I like it now that it has been stable for the last week or so. A few problems to sort out here and there mostly due to my config.
02:30	<Zelta>	wait, nvm
02:30	<[T]-Rex>	is it possible to put my ubuntu on my uSB drive and use it at a friends house?

02:30	<bazhang>	isdepopecath: yes wubi or unetbootin

I guess try a "sudo aptitude purge nvidia-glx-new" and update you repository "sudo aptitude update" and then reinstall, besides that you got me beat, my driver just loads, I think maybe your file is corrupt somehow however unlikely that is.
02:41	<Millertime_018>	yea but see, in ubuntu 7.1 my light for my wireless card flashed when in use
02:41	<Pelo>	chibi_killstick, reinstall that package from the command line,   sudo apt-get install packagename --reinstall
02:41	<Millertime_018>	now, in 8.04 it doesn't
02:41	<Millertime_018>	it stays off all the time.
02:41	<ubuntu__>	that blows
02:41	<Roscar>	ok, I've got a question. Does Ubuntu release a list of changes since 7.10?
02:41	<Millertime_018>	i was talking about through the terminal
02:41	<bazhang>	Millertime_018: that is it? the light? does the card work?
02:41	<binarybandit>	Millertime_018, think of all the power you're saving!

02:44	<marko-_->	Millertime_018, because hardy just came out
02:44	<Roscar>	pelo: I was looking at the release notes. They give you a list of know problems and issues for upgrading but not a list of changes.
02:44	<sean_>	tanath: hahahha trouble now. compiz manager isn't working. :P
02:44	<marko-_->	and people are upgrading there system
02:44	<marko-_->	all over the world
02:44	<sammy>	Roscar: because a lot of your packages are out of date, and newer, tested, 'stable' versions are available that people have released. as long as you're already getting security updates, that's the only reason. it's been either 6 months or a year, so there's probably a good number of fixes and feature updates, probably hundreds? thousands?
02:44	<bazhang>	Millertime_018: today is release day
02:44	<bbyever>	i opened the update-manager and checked for updated and there were none, so i proceeded to upgrade to hardy, and while the upgrade was starting, update-manager said there were 710 updates available. Then a window came up and asked me if i wanted a partial upgrade.. should i do that, or the upgrade to hardy?
02:44	<marko-_->	you must understand this..
02:44	<Millertime_018>	marko-_-: what does that mean?
02:44	<tanath>	sean_, oi
02:44	<taxman>	ok, does anybody know the correct path at cdimage for hardy? I have the beta and I'd like to rsync so I don't have to waste someone's bandwidth for the whole iso. The script I have to rsync the dailies gets them from rsync://cdimage.ubuntu.com/cdimage/daily-live/current what would be the path for the LTS?
02:45	<caveman26>	where can I get a new sources.list? I screwed up my apt and need a new sources.list... for gutsy
02:45	<tanath>	sean_, ccsm?
02:45	<Stroganoff>	blankhead look up HorizSync and VertRefresh in your Xorg.conf
02:45	<Millertime_018>	bazhang: they dont do updates on the release day?
02:45	<Pelo>	Roscar, that's all I have, ask again periodicaly
02:45	<newscane>	i'm trying to debootstrap, and i keep getting messages about "failure trying to run chroot /target mount -t proc proc /proc".  ideas?  trying this after booting under floppies from sarge.

02:45	<marko-_->	that too many people are downloadaing stuff from the server Millertime_018 ... and the server doesn't have a super connection you know

02:45	<binarybandit>	chibi_killstick, I had that issue at one point
02:45	<Millertime_018>	ooooh. so will it work after a while?
02:45	<Pelo>	chibi_killstick, sudo apt-get remove  synaptic --purge &&  sudo apt-get install synaptic
02:46	<bod_>	mojo, no you have to ask the operators to add it
02:46	<marko-_->	Millertime_018, it will
02:46	<chibi_killstick>	binarybandit: what did you do?
02:46	<marko-_->	try tomorrow
02:46	<chibi_killstick>	Pelo: interesting...let's go for it
02:46	<binarybandit>	on gentoo, but same idea, it was a missing symlink
02:46	<MachinTrucChose_>	does Ubuntu not have a Terminal font? The X-Chat screenshots show it, but it's not in the list. Is it called something else in Ubuntu?

02:52	<KyleK>	Jordanjay29: I may have just needed to tick off a checkbox saying that its open wep though ;)
02:52	<binarybandit>	yeah :/
02:52	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: oh, then you shouldnt have to configure anything else.  all computers on the same lan should be able to see your computer on port 80
02:52	<LainIwakura>	Can someone help me? I cannot get "sudo pppoeconf" to work? Thanks.
02:52	<Pelo>	moDumass, where are y ou looking ?
02:52	<binarybandit>	chibi_killstick, well, all I could reccomend is to reinstall cairo and gtk
02:52	<soulwarp_>	is it possible to upgrade my 7.10-8.04 through the install CD?
02:53	<moDumass>	system preferences
02:53	<Jordanjay29>	KyleK: lol. Private chat work better?
02:53	<didy>	.................
02:53	<chibi_killstick>	binarybandit: i did try that and didn't seem to get anywhere...let's try again
02:53	<Pelo>	LainIwakura,  do you have admin priviledge ?
02:53	<rich_freecomm_>	I'll get this eventually....
02:53	<genji_>	sammy: :p The man isn't really helpful (or I missed something), nor are the comments in the file
02:53	<LainIwakura>	Pelo: Yes.
02:53	<bazhang>	alternate cd yes soulwarp_
02:53	<DBautell>	soulwarp_, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. To mount the ISO you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
02:53	<KyleK>	Jordanjay29: I'll see if I have the page I used open
02:53	<rich_freecomm_>	  /nickserv password realpassword    doesn't quite work now
02:53	<moDumass>	Pelo System>preferences used to have "desktop effects" i think, id enable them and things would be fine
02:53	<genji_>	sammy: they tell you how to assign values to specific tokens, but I don't know what the syntax of my token is
02:53	<Pelo>	LainIwakura, when you say you can'T get it to work  ? which part ? command does not start or you get through it but it won't work ?
02:53	<genji_>	sammy: if it's the full path or something else
02:53	<LainIwakura>	Pelo: It finds only two ethernet devices: eth0 and wlan0. In Gutsy, I remember it finding at least 4 devices.
02:53	<Ubuntong>	erat123: Im running wordpress blog on Ubuntu. Localhost works fine but no other workstations on my LAN can connect to it. Any ideas?
02:53	<soulwarp_>	thanks

02:54	<flowbot>	hey, i remember seeing a link on planet ubuntu or somewhere about upgrading a Hardy beta image to full release via rsync ... anyone know this link?
02:54	<binarybandit>	chibi_killstick, another option is to menacingly hold a vista dvd in front of you computer
02:54	<Fritzel>	ok well synaptic will no longer reload sources it gets stuck  any idea what that's about?
02:54	<seamus7>	moDumass look in System/Preferences/Appearance/DesktopEffectsTab
02:54	<psych_>	like it was about to do it
02:54	<binarybandit>	that should scare it into submission
02:54	<psych_>	but it didnt
02:54	<chibi_killstick>	binarybandit: lol!
02:54	<LainIwakura>	Pelo: It says that it cannot find any devices for it to work or something along those lines. That is, it doesn't allow me to enter my username and password. I cannot get online.

02:54	<MachinTrucChose_>	If I try to download Konversation (the KDE IRC client), it will download the KDE libraries, right? Does that mean I'm going to have system libraries loaded all the time, increasing my OS memory usage, or just when I'm using Konversation?

02:54	<Shadow_X>	anyone else been having problems with synaptic timing out today?

02:54	<bbyever>	seamus7: the second time i didnt get the error messages
02:55	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: can you ping your web server from another client computer?
02:55	<caveman26>	I tried upgrading... it broke apt, I need a new sources.list and cant find one, some1 said it was on the live cd, but where is it on the cd? I cant find it
02:55	<bazhang>	Shadow_X: nearly everyone

02:55	<Pelo>	FJSS, where does it say resourse busy ?
02:56	<Ubuntong>	erat123:  yeah, I just figured out that I can open the generic Apache2 site too.  It must be a Wordpress thing?

02:56	<Auctionedllama>	Hi, I just installed Ubuntu on my teachers laptop, and all she really uses it for, is to browse the web and to power our "smartboard" projector during school. Now I went to the smartboards website, and got their linux version, and when I went to install it, it said could not install package, but yet the system meets the requirements.. can someone help me out with this? Thanks
02:56	<KyleK>	Jordanjay29: ftp://ftp.compaq.com/pub/softpaq/sp34001-34500/sp34152.exe

02:56	<Pelo>	moDumass, what is your video card ?

02:56	<rich_freecomm_>	all this cutting and pasting each time is a pain in the butt
02:57	<Ubuntong>	erat123: Wordpress is  pretty awesome.
02:57	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: is it a blogging tool?
02:57	<Jordanjay29>	KyleK: I have an HP. I know they're the same company, but is that just the driver for Windows from the Compaq site?
02:57	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: like an editor?
02:57	<Pelo>	FJSS, check in menu >	system  >	prefs, sound  make sure the audio card is selected for each event
02:57	<Pelo>	Auctionedllama, what kind of pakcage did you get from the site ?
02:57	<Jordanjay29>	KyleK: If that's the case, I know where I can find the driver for my version and computer
02:58	<Ubuntong>	erat123:  yes, and it's easy enough for me to use. That says a lot. :) You'll want to get some templates for it too.
02:58	<KyleK>	Jordanjay29: I cant find the page that linked it, but it had a table of which specific ones work with which driver, and I matched the PCI ID
02:58	<bbyever>	seamus7: its also asked me for a restart, so im doing that now...
02:58	<bbyever>	seamus7: thanks
02:58	<KyleK>	Jordanjay29: I've also got an HP, DV6624CA :)

02:58	<Auctionedllama>	it came in a tar.gz,  nd I extracted it, and there was a file just called smartboardinsstallblahblahpackage
02:58	<Ubuntong>	erat123: You'll need PHP and Mysql too

02:59	<Jordanjay29>	KyleK: What website? Is it in your history?
02:59	<Auctionedllama>	pelo, any suggestions?
02:59	<rconan>	anyone had any luck installing hardy onto a fakeraid? I was looking at htis but it seems to go wrong at the partitioning part. The installer treats each partition on my RAID as a disk and makes a partition table for each one
02:59	<Pelo>	GerbilSoft, sorry don'T know about taht one,  I donT' knwo about networkd deployment
02:59	<GerbilSoft>	k
02:59	<moparisthebest>	where can i find a list of package server mirrors?

03:00	<GerbilSoft>	and i already hacked the 8.04alt initrd once because the preseed fetch methods didn't include http for some reason
03:00	<sammy>	moparisthebest: you can use synaptic to have it find the closest one for you with a ping test
03:00	<Auctionedllama>	UHM
03:00	<mvinsc>	i still have to use ndiswrapper
03:00	<Auctionedllama>	pelo: there was none

03:03	<favoritefood0>	In all the others, my DVD drive worked perfectly.
03:03	<yago>	I have a big problem with the update, someone can help me?
03:03	<favoritefood0>	Now I can't get it to open or close inside Ubuntu.
03:04	<moDumass>	thats cool, its more that "restricted driver" option should be in system admin
03:04	<rich_freecomm_>	ooooh, so you are SUPPOSED to use different nicknames on different servers...I see
03:04	<moDumass>	but its not
03:04	<Zambezi>	taxman: It's my main machine. It's an official project, but pre alpha stage.
03:04	<Pelo>	HardyOne, that,s waht it did for me when I put the dvd it , I was just expecting it to ask to be added to the repos list but it also offered to upgrade
03:04	<navreet>	how come my gutsy machine is not asking me to upgrade??
03:04	<p0w3r0n3>	trying to run a unzip -a on an .exe and it fails in hardon....

03:04	<sammy>	rich_freecomm_: all the servers are connected to the same network, think of it as redundancy. you *can't* have the same nick on two servers on the same network.

03:05	<c0mp13371331337_>	navreet-  You don't have the Hardy repos in your sources.list file.
03:05	<Pelo>	CaptainMorgan, sorry to hear that
03:05	<Zambezi>	taxman: Word! I'll hold for awhile then. I have to stick with Pidgin for now. :-/
03:05	<favoritefood0>	As in, if I physically hit the open button on the drive, it won't do a thing.
03:05	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, that would make it open , the -f is to force
03:05	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, i was hoping I didn't have to do it manually, i wanted to see if it really worked out of the box
03:05	<harsha>	What is a swap drive?
03:05	<Pelo>	harsha, RAM extension on your hdd
03:06	<favoritefood0>	the standard mount point for dvd drives is /mount/dvd right?
03:06	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, is it unmounted from your desktop ?
03:06	<Zambezi>	Pelo: I couldn't say it better myself. Thumbs up!
03:06	<rich_freecomm_>	sammy: sounds silly...I want to log into the server and be in many channels under the same name......
03:06	<favoritefood0>	On my desktop I see "Blank CD"
03:06	<HardyOne>	Pelo: you know what the user peak was for #ubuntu today?

03:06	<Pelo>	HardyOne, no
03:07	<rich_freecomm_>	sammy: so what's your name on Freenode?
03:07	<yago>	Well, I had used a Cd to update Kubuntu 8.04, every was great untill display showed "configurating chillispot (1.0-8) ...", then it stopped, and I shutdown, then now I cannot do nothing
03:07	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: i installed everything, but when i go to http://localhost/wordpress, it tries to download a phtml file
03:07	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, yep... i know, but i just want to see it prompt me for an upgrade, i just wanted to see if it worked... btw, what's the best way to upgrade?
03:07	<professor_>	KyleK, how do I switch the mirros
03:07	<juano__>	kubuntu 8.04 out already ?
03:07	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, should I use bittorrent to download the release?? and then mount it via loopback?
03:07	<Odd-rationale>	juano__: yes
03:07	<harsha>	Pelo: ok, I was asked to create a swap drive while installation of Ubuntu, is it required only while installation or that space will be used even after installation?
03:07	<myf>	sorry for repeating but my update-manager won't response after i press the upgrade button, anybody knows why?
03:07	<KyleK>	professor_: its under settings
03:07	<juano__>	Odd-rationale: thanks :)
03:07	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, would that be best? (in terms of not using ubuntu server's bandwidths)
03:07	<KyleK>	like Settings ->	Software Sources
03:08	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, take a paperclip, unbend it ,  look on the cd drive face, just below the try , little pin point  hole,  sick the papeclip in it and puch
03:08	<favoritefood0>	I did that.
03:08	<favoritefood0>	That's how I know it's empty.
03:08	<Skuller>	Hey guys, I'm trying to install 7.10 on a school PC but it ends up being at the terminal sort of prompt and it says 'busybox' at the top. I tried 7.04 and it works sweet. Any suggestions?
03:08	<professor_>	KyleK, Im sorry Im a noob , how do I do
03:08	<favoritefood0>	If I put in a disk, it doesn't spin up.
03:08	<c0mp13371331337_>	navreet-  Bittorrent would probably be the fastest at this point, as the Ubuntu servers/mirrors are all bogged down at the moment.  Which may be why it doesn't prompt you to upgrade right away.  They may give a few days for all the manual-upgraders to get it out of their system before rolling out the option to upgrade to the general public.
03:08	<Pelo>	harsha, it's used after ,  make it about 2xram  max 2 gig
03:08	<Stroganoff>	Skuller, press ctrl+alt+f4
03:08	<nickrud>	Skuller when you boot, do f6 (?) and try some of the boot options
03:08	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, got it
03:08	<juano__>	Skuller: whats the hardware for that pc ?
03:09	<thiebaude>	8.04 is nice
03:09	<KyleK>	professor_: System ->	Admin ->	Softwar Sources
03:09	<Skuller>	Ok I'll try that right now
03:09	<Venko>	Hey, I'm having some issues replacing the gnome-main-menu image in Hardy. I've tried the gconf-editor method and directly replacing the file. After both times I've reloaded gnome-panel with no success.

03:09	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, might be a bad drive ,  might be a problem with the strap,  might be badly pluged in ,  turn off the comp, open the box, check the connections make sure the power cabloe and the data strap are not damaged
03:09	<GerbilSoft>	apparently the alternate install CD no longer works for network boot
03:09	<KyleK>	and in the middle where it says like USA click that and choose a different mirror, kernel.org is what im using atm
03:09	<GerbilSoft>	so i have to manually get the alt install initrd
03:09	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, it works perfectly in Bios.
03:09	<Venko>	Is this a Hardy bug or am I doing something wrong?
03:10	<favoritefood0>	It worked perfectly 15 mins ago in Feisty.
03:10	<p0w3r0n3>	unzip -a on a .exe in ubuntu hardy... fails... how do i fix this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
03:10	<favoritefood0>	It's DEFINITELY something in Hardy.
03:10	<Skuller>	juano__: its a p4 3.ghz, 1gb RAM, PC, custom complied
03:10	<Shadow_X>	wow this is bad. i just installed xp on my old machine (for using photoshop and other windows based apps i need) and it has no generic driver for my NIC :|
03:10	<harsha>	Pelo: I have 1 GB of ram that means I have to allote 2 GB for swap drive, am I correct?
03:10	<woddf2>	Hello
03:10	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, you can open/close your cd/dvd ddrive from the bios ? that' sa new one to me
03:10	<woddf2>	Update Manager keeps hanging!
03:10	<Stroganoff>	p0w3r0n3: sudo apt-get install unzip
03:10	<lopin>	Actually, manually selecting a mirror close to home is working nicely...
03:10	<Pelo>	harsha, yes
03:10	<Ubuntong>	erat123: I'm no expert but make sure PHP is installed correctly. maybe install myphpadmin so you can make sure it's working.  A kind of shortcut is to install egroupware since it's requirements are PHP, Apache2, Mysql. So you will get everything installed correctly.
03:10	<TheDukeNY>	How do I had my internal hard drive to my desktop?
03:10	<lopin>	Go to software sources, and select a mirror that's closer to you
03:10	<TheDukeNY>	*add
03:10	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, as the computer is going through BIOS, I can hit the open/close button and it will open or close the drive.
03:10	<juano__>	Skuller: hmm ok, was thinking maybe you forgot to check if it was x64 architecture, cause in that case you need to download the x64 cd
03:10	<rich_freecomm>	ahhh
03:10	<Pelo>	woddf2, it's release day the servers are under heavy loads,  get the torrent for the alternate install cd and upgrade from that
03:10	<harsha>	Pelo: Thanks for the help.
03:11	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, the drive also worked perfectly 15 mins ago in Feisty.
03:11	<p0w3r0n3>	Stronganoff, its already installed?
03:11	<p0w3r0n3>	Stronganoff, any other ideas?
03:11	<Skuller>	By the way the problem I mentioned arises when trying to boot off the live version of the OS
03:11	<p0w3r0n3>	Stroganoff, any other ideas?
03:11	<lopin>	Pelo:  I couldn't get that to work, but switching to a local server helped TREMENDOUSLY!
03:11	<p0w3r0n3>	Stroganoff, already installed
03:11	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, I don't have an answer for you , report the bug to launcpad
03:11	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: i'll give that a try and see where it goes.  i went to their site, and it looks cool.  i've just never heard of it.  sorry i cant really help you with your problem though.
03:11	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, Okay.
03:11	<Shadow_X>	Pelo, can you perform a standard upgrade from the alternate cd?
03:11	<lopin>	Shadow_X
03:11	<HardyOne>	Shadow_X: yes
03:11	<DBautell>	Shadow_X, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
03:11	<KyleK>	hey can I upgrade from feisty to hardy?
03:12	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 you should do   tail -f /var/log/syslog , try inserting a disk, and including the output in your report
03:12	<shane2peru>	anyone know anything about a DVD iso for ubuntu (of course the 8.04 edition)
03:12	<favoritefood0>	Oh, pelo, get this, Sysinfo detects the drive just fine.
03:12	<juano__>	Odd-rationale: i'm off to try 8.04 now :P:)
03:12	<Pelo>	Shadow_X, yes,  alt cd or dvd, but not from the live cd
03:12	<Ubuntong>	erat123: Thanks and good luck with wordpress.
03:12	<MachinTrucChose_>	MachinTrucChose_,
03:12	<lopin>	Pelo Chaning to a local server helped...
03:12	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, I get the issue I just donT' have a fix for you
03:12	<MachinTrucChose_>	sorry, just testing
03:12	<professor_>	KyleK, and then what
03:12	<Shadow_X>	yea i know not from livecd, but its been forever since i used the alt. thanks :)
03:12	<myf>	hi, how many people has been able to upgrade to hardy here?
03:12	<shane2peru>	in particular, where to get the DVD iso?
03:12	<lopin>	I can't use the alt cd to upgrade...
03:12	<blankhead>	does anyone know how to get into text only mode in hardy heron?
03:12	<lopin>	It locks...
03:12	<Pelo>	lopin, helped with what ?
03:12	<HardyOne>	MachinTrucChose_: this text should be red
03:12	<DBautell>	!torrents
03:12	<ubotu>	Hardy can be torrented from http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent or http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-server-amd64.iso.torrent depending on your architecture. Torrents for other Ubuntu flavours can be found at: http://releases.ubuntu.com/ (CD) or http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases (DVD).
03:12	<Odd-rationale>	juano__: go for it. I'm seeding all the alternative cd's :)
03:12	<thiebaude>	i upgraded 3 days ago
03:12	<favoritefood0>	nickrud, what exactly do you mean? I insert a disk and the drive does nothing. I have to open the drive manually, close it manually.
03:13	<juano__>	Odd-rationale: good job :)
03:13	<KyleK>	professor_: after you select a difffernt mirror? close it
03:13	<MachinTrucChose_>	hardyone: thank you
03:13	<unop>	blankhead, ctrl+alt+f1 ?
03:13	<aubrac>	KyleK: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
03:13	<lopin>	I finally could download updates by going from us.ubuntu.com to a local server, hosted at WVU
03:13	<HardyOne>	juano__: I am also seeding all the iso's
03:13	<moon2js>	Trying to upgrade from Gutsy to Hardy, but update-manager hangs (Beryl-greys out) on "Preparing to upgrade" and doesn't do anything. Are the repos overloaded or do I have a problem?
03:13	<cirkit>	If you're on 8.04 RC1, will "update manager" be good enough for the upgrade?
03:13	<KyleK>	it'll apt-get update automatiicaly
03:13	<Stroganoff>	p0w3r0n3 maybe the EXE isnt ZIP compressed. try xarchiver
03:13	<MachinTrucChose_>	X-chat is the nicest client so far...LostIRC has no features, neither does Xchat-Gnome. Konversation's pretty cool too, but I guess everyone was right to recommend X-chat.
03:13	<shane2peru>	Thanks DBautell
03:13	<sammy>	lopin: I've been trying to tell people once I changed my mirror everything went quickly, but I guess there is something to wanting more iso discs out there :)
03:13	<professor_>	KyleK, no where do I find the mirror
03:13	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 ooohh, sounds hardware. The disk tray action should have nothing to do with the os
03:13]  * Pelo is just seeding the dvd , he can only manage 76 kps out 
03:13	<lopin>	Sammy ^.^
03:13	<myf>	moon2js: same here
03:13	<bod_>	moon2js, the repo's are being raped
03:13	<nosa-J>	hurray for heron!
03:13	<shane2peru>	or, thanks ubotu lol
03:14	<juano__>	HardyOne: Odd-rationale keep it up, cyou in a while
03:14	<favoritefood0>	nickrud, the thing is is that it worked in feisty a few minutes ago, works in BIOS, it's even detected.
03:14	<DBautell>	shane2peru, I try
03:14	<jumpkick>	need apt-bittorrent
03:14	<moon2js>	so once the repos are recover, it will work?
03:14	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: irssi
03:14	<Tailsfan>	What does this mean for when a get a error with this: SET_MODULE_OWNER
03:14	<Odd-rationale>	I have two computer seeding
03:14	<favoritefood0>	I can go into my feisty live CD, and I'll come talk on IRC lol
03:14	<MachinTrucChose_>	sammy: thanks, not a fan of console clients :P
03:14	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 do you dual boot? Will it boot the hardy cd?
03:14	<KyleK>	professor_: download from: its a dropdown, click around in there :)
03:14	<Millertime_018>	how can i get vmware-server to show up in the add/remove applications box?
03:14	<Pelo>	okaratas, I'm out again,  later folks
03:14	<Shadow_X>	another question. do distro upgrades fail often? (I upgraded an old ubuntu server to 7.10, and it failed to reboot properly. i was a n00b then so reinstalled lol)
03:14	<thiebaude>	cya
03:14	<HardyOne>	late Pelo
03:14	<jPratt>	Wow the servers have calmed down thank god
03:14	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; I just upgraded from feisty.
03:14	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: then try pidgin/gajim/kopete/etc with an irc plugin or a jabber server with an irc gateway.
03:15	<Millertime_018>	how can i get vmware-server to show up in the add/remove box?
03:15	<shane2peru>	DBautell, hmm, seems as that there is a traffic jam at that site.
03:15	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 I know, but we're talking about current troubleshooting info
03:15	<taxman>	yago: after you got that message, you were able to shutdown normally with no errors? And now what exactly happens? What do you mean by can't do anything?
03:15	<moon2js>	Can I do a dist-upgrade but have it access the repos from a CD?
03:15	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: pidgin and gajim actually both do really well with irc transports on jabber servers. so does psi
03:15	<ffm_>	Millertime_018, Just remove it via synaptic.
03:15	<ffm_>	Millertime_018, Sys>Admin>Synaptic.
03:15	<KyleK>	damn
03:15	<damo22>	sudo: timestamp too far in the future: Apr 25 13:04:51 2008
03:15	<MachinTrucChose_>	Pidgin is the first one I tried. It's terrible. Maybe for a person who's never going to use IRC these multi-purpose clients are good enough, but not for me
03:15	<favoritefood0>	nickrud, I only use ubuntu.
03:15	<ffm_>	!language | KyleK
03:15	<ubotu>	KyleK: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
03:15	<HardyOne>	!aptcd | moon2js
03:15	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about aptcd - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
03:15	<DBautell>	okaratas, howabout ftp://lug.bu.edu/pub/distro/ubuntu/
03:15	<nickrud>	moon2js from an alternate cd, yes
03:15	<KyleK>	i guess im screwed for using 7.04
03:15	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; I only had feisty installed.
03:15	<damo22>	how can i fix that: sudo: timestamp too far in the future:
03:15	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, Use XChat for IRC.
03:15	<jPratt>	How can i update my Java?
03:15	<DBautell>	durn autocomlete
03:15	<ffm_>	damo22, sudo -k
03:15	<KyleK>	ffm_: damn is disney friendly :p
03:15	<nosa-J>	theses downloads take forever
03:16	<Tailsfan>	!modules
03:16	<ubotu>	To compile modules and drivers that are not bundled with the standard kernel,  for more info /msg ubotu kernel  , install the relevant package, usually called "<modulename>-source", and run « sudo module-assistant » (you will have to do this again after kernel updates). To prevent specific modules from loading, see /msg ubotu blacklist
03:16	<binarybandit>	irssi! :D
03:16	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: I think you'll find there isn't much going on in the way of irc client development, I'd assume the most would be going on in those multi-purpose clients. also, gajim is a jabber only client ;)
03:16	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 so, try booting a cd. See if you get different action at that level.
03:16	<MachinTrucChose_>	ffm: that's what I'm using now. I tried like 4-5 clients prior to deciding on X-chat.
03:16	<favoritefood0>	I'll be right back.
03:16	<Tailsfan>	Oh
03:16	<Kl4m>	Shadow_X: server upgrades should never break, except in special situations which you should know about before.
03:16	<seamus7>	MachinTrucChose_ I'm on IRC via Pidgin ... works nicely
03:16	<leap>	where is the best torrent site for 8.04 alternate-amd64 cd
03:16	<moon2js>	alt cd. I have the iso and can burn. can I just insert and it will do, or do I need to some how point update-manager to the disc?
03:16	<ffm_>	binarybandit, for when you're on the road, yeah.
03:16	<KyleK>	ffm_: !calmdown >	ffm_ :)
03:16	<bmoll8>	anyone know where I can find a good review of the new ubuntu release
03:16	<ianliu_88>	How do I remove those shadows/glow from ubuntu windows?
03:16	<smallfoot->	i should install gnash, swfdec or adobe?
03:16	<damo22>	ffm_: it was capital K thanks
03:16	<nickrud>	moon2js the hardy cd will ask if you want to upgrade when you insert it
03:16	<ffm_>	bmoll8, It works well, much better than the prior one.
03:16	<MachinTrucChose_>	basically an IRC client needs to have a decent interface (with a list of users! can't believe some didn't have that), syntax highlighting, DCC sends, CTCP suites, aliases...it's very minimal stuff that was already in mIRC 10 years ago
03:17	<osmosis>	whats the difference between nvidia and nvidia_new ?
03:17	<black_13>	what would cause ubuntu server install to get stuck scanning mirror stage?
03:17	<nickrud>	moon2js the alternate cd, remember
03:17	<moon2js>	nickrud: but it has to be the alt, not the reg?
03:17	<ffm_>	damo22, What?
03:17	<seamus7>	ianliu_88: try disabling various compiz plugins in Advanced Desktop Effects
03:17	<nickrud>	moon2js yes
03:17	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: which is why x-chat is your client of choice, it was around 10 years ago, too, iirc.
03:17	<ffm_>	damo22, Oh.
03:17	<damo22>	ffm_: it was capital K .. sudo -K
03:17	<nickrud>	black_13 probably server overload
03:17	<moon2js>	nickrud: cool, thanks!
03:17	<woddf2>	I may upgrade tomorrow.
03:17	<Daedius_>	hey all
03:17	<Shadow_X>	Kl4m, i think it was due to ignorance about linux in general. ive learned alot more lately. i used to be daunted by the thought of linux, but now, im comfortable with is. almost as comfy as i am on windows (which i have spent my whole life on, sadly)
03:17	<Daedius_>	i'm having trouble with the 2.6.24 kernel
03:17	<Daedius_>	I'm also a n00b with ubuntu
03:17	<binarybandit>	ffm_, not just for the road :(
03:17	<Skuller>	I try booting off a 7.10 live desktop CD but after the orange bar going back and forth it just leaves me at a command prompt kind of place with a 'busybox' title at the top. This does not happen with a 7.04 CD on the same PC. Any suggestions? I tried ctrl-alt-F4 with no luck and neither with F6
03:17	<shane2peru>	what advantage is there having the DVD?  More packages, is it the alternate CD and the DesktopCD install wrapped into one?
03:18	<Daedius_>	anyonek know the quickest route I should go to get the 2.6.25 kernel on ubuntu?
03:18	<Daedius_>	for 64bit system
03:18	<ffm_>	shane2peru, If you have a fast internet connection, the DVD offers little adcantage.
03:18	<nickrud>	Daedius_ the only way is compiling it yourself
03:18	<Kl4m>	bmoll8: http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=682 is a "review" but don't go there if you want a critic
03:18	<shane2peru>	Skuller, do you have the 8.04 CD???  Hardy, it is just out
03:18	<ffm_>	Daedius_, Don't?
03:18	<nickrud>	!kernel | Daedius_
03:18	<ubotu>	Daedius_: The core of the Ubuntu Operating System is the Linux kernel: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel - You shouldn't have to compile your own, but if you're convinced you do, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile - For more: /msg ubotu stages
03:18	<shane2peru>	ffm_, so there are more packages?
03:18	<ffm_>	shane2peru, Yes.
03:18	<dragobr_>	isso é um teste
03:18	<Kl4m>	leap: Get the torrent file pretty much anywhere, you'll get connected to the same torrent
03:18	<WeeJa1>	Hi guys! any one using vpnc here?
03:18	<Daedius_>	hmmm
03:18	<jPratt>	Ubuntu is all i am running now this morning i also had windows *Laughs at Micro$oft
03:19	<ffm_>	shane2peru, But all of them are avalible via the repos.
03:19	<shane2peru>	ffm_, for like if I wanted to install on other computers that don't have fast internet?
03:19	<shane2peru>	ffm_, right
03:19	<ffm_>	shane2peru, Yeah, for that.
03:19	<Skuller>	shane2peru: No, I don't at the moment and I don't have the connection speed to download it quickly either, have to do with 7.10 or 7.04 (this one works)
03:19	<MachinTrucChose_>	daedius: I heard the performance difference is negligible for a desktop user with 64-bit. People on forums seemed to recommend not bothering for now and sticking with 32-bit
03:19	<eZe>	i just fornated a partition, but fdisk still displays the wring filesystem type, does it need a reboot to recognize that?
03:19	<leap>	ffound one no seeders
03:19	<Kl4m>	WeeJa1: I used to
03:19	<corbett>	hi, is there anyone who can help me get my maxtor external hard drive mounted and working on ububtu 7.10 - which ive just loaded on pc to replace windows, it worked perfectly fine elsewhere on widows, I think I need to run some checks as dont know why it wont mount
03:19	<ffm_>	shane2peru, See also "apt on cd"
03:19	<Daedius_>	can you guys think of a way I can test the usability of my usb mouse outside of X11?
03:19	<Rycher>	hey when i try to install under the terminal. I have a problem.... When it ask for the admin password in the terminal, it wont let me type anything.? any ideas..
03:19	<WeeJa1>	Kl4m: did you use it with a secure token or pre-shared key?
03:19	<Daedius_>	I don't know if the problem is my kernel or X11 itself
03:19	<nickrud>	MachinTrucChose_ I ran 64bit in feisty, but switched back to 32 for hardy for that very reason
03:19	<Kl4m>	leap: get the official torrent from ubuntu.com
03:19	<ffm_>	Daedius_, Why would you want to use it out side of X?
03:19	<ffm_>	Daedius_, Not off hand.
03:20	<nickrud>	Daedius_ gpm might do the trick
03:20	<shane2peru>	SKuhn, hmm, did you order a CD for shipit?  What country are you in?  There is probably a loco group close
03:20	<Kl4m>	WeeJa1: PSK.
03:20	<WeeJa1>	I can't get the Network Manager + vpnc interface to promt me for a secure token input...
03:20	<Daedius_>	My usb mouse isn't working on 8.04
03:20	<ffm_>	Rycher, Install what?
03:20	<black_13>	nickrud, is there a way choose a different server?
03:20	<HardyOne>	Rycher: you type and dont see the characters?
03:20	<plik>	shane2peru: mouseon console is handy for cut & paste
03:20	<Jobias>	Rycher: if you're referring to the fact that the cursor doesn't move in the terminal, that's normal. i believe it's a security feature, so that no one can tell how long your password is
03:20	<WeeJa1>	Kl4m: I guess its time to read :-)
03:20	<lopin>	I can't get cdromupgrade to work.
03:20	<ffm_>	WeeJa1, You mean for your password?
03:20	<WeeJa1>	yea
03:20	<Rycher>	it wont let me type anything
03:20	<nickrud>	black_13 system->admin->software sources, on the dropdown button on the first tab, choose other
03:20	<HardyOne>	Rycher: type in the password and hit enter
03:20	<plik>	oops, not to shane2peru , pesky accidental tabs
03:20	<Rycher>	dosnt work
03:20	<shane2peru>	SKuller, hmm, did you order a CD for shipit?  What country are you in?  There is probably a loco group close
03:20	<Kl4m>	WeeJa1: I didn't use network-manager, I connected to my campus wireless and started vpnc in a console
03:20	<WeeJa1>	ffm_: I imported my Cisco vpn client config but it does ot promt me for secure token
03:21	<shane2peru>	sorry SKuhn wrong person
03:21	<shane2peru>	thanks plik
03:21	<dbristow>	well that tears it.  releases.ubuntu.com's copy of wubu.exe has the same md5sum as the rest I've tried
03:21	<black_13>	nickrud i didnt see that on the server install
03:21	<WeeJa1>	Kl4m: ill be happy with console
03:21	<Skuller>	shane2peru: Yes I did
03:21	<ffm_>	WeeJa1, Ah. Can't help then.
03:21	<lopin>	!cdromupgrade

03:21	<eklof>	Hi all! anyone upgraded a 6.06 server to 8.04 yet? Did it work? :)
03:21	<ffm_>	dbristow, What's the issue?
03:21	<Jobias>	Rycher: what kind of an error are you getting?
03:21	<shane2peru>	ffm_, apt on cd?
03:21	<MachinTrucChose_>	where would I go if I wanted nicer text fonts than the ones included in Ubuntu? Are all of the Windows one proprietary Microsoft stuff or something (Arial, Courier New, Terminal, Verdana, etc)?
03:21	<lopin>	Why is there no documentation about the server death?
03:21	<DBautell>	ISOupgrade
03:21	<MachinTrucChose_>	can't find anything using synaptic
03:21	<twinkie_addict>	the repos must realy be hit hard , i cant refresh my apt list :)

03:21	<DBautell>	To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
03:21	<sean_>	MachinTrucChose_: mstcorefonts I believe is the name
03:21	<ffm_>	lopin, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
03:21	<Kl4m>	eklof: It is a supported upgrade path But I don't know anyone who did it actually
03:21	<Jobias>	MachinTrucChose_: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
03:21	<shane2peru>	ffm_, that could be very handy, where do I find out about it?  Wouldn't apt on DVD be more efficient. :)
03:21	<Seven_Six_Two>	I'm wanting to go from 7.04 but I think I might wait a day. anyone done it without major issues?
03:22	<seamus7>	anyone finding FF3 beta 5 just too buggy at the moment? have many of you downgraded to FF2? or gone elsewhere?
03:22	<ffm_>	shane2peru, Same thing.
03:22	<MachinTrucChose_>	manish: open synaptic and search for "flash".
03:22	<HardyOne>	!fonts | MachinTrucChose_
03:22	<vicmarconi>	is this final version the same as the release candidate of 2 days earlier?

03:22	<nickrud>	black_13 ah, server :) . You need to go to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors , pick one and edit /etc/apt/sources.list
03:22	<seamus7>	oops I'm not supposed to poll
03:22	<MachinTrucChose_>	thank you guys
03:22	<eklof>	Kl4m: I need some test-users before me :)
03:22	<lopin>	twinkie_addict: changing to a closer server will let you get your apt get working, but don't try to upgrade
03:22	<dmsuperman>	I'm doubting this, but is there anyway to run visual studio on linux? I _really_ like the intellisense features and project management of it, so I either want visual studio in linux or something similar with intellisense (one that learns from your code, not just built in functions)
03:22	<underdog5004>	lopin, there's nothing to document, so many users trying to download 700+ Mb from a few servers is basically a DDOS against the servers...unintentional, but there you go :)
03:22	<dbristow>	all the copies I have have the same, different, md5sum, from funet, mirrors.kernel.org, everywhere
03:22	<shane2peru>	ffm_, where do I find out more info about the DVD, something to read on it?
03:22	<plik>	vicmarconi: apparently the last changes were on 22nd
03:22	<Jobias>	Rycher: that's odd. i don't really know what's wrong. sorry
03:22	<dbristow>	I think the MD5SUMS file has got to be wrong
03:22	<black_13>	how do you do during the install process
03:22	<lopin>	underdog5004: I definitely know that, I'm a comp sci major...
03:22	<nickrud>	Seven_Six_Two it won't hurt to wait a week, let some bugs that weren't found without really widespread use get fixed, and the mirrors to settle down
03:22	<ffm_>	shane2peru, hold on..
03:22	<J-a-k-e>	hi does anyone here know anything about sound in ubuntu?
03:22	<underdog5004>	as am I
03:23	<lopin>	The question is: why is there not a disclaimer on the main site?
03:23	<j_humphrey>	maco: hey, you there?
03:23	<J-a-k-e>	hi does anyone here know anything about sound *quality* in ubuntu?
03:23	<Skuller>	Any problem if I install 7.04 now? I mean as in its not too old or does not have a huge lack of features does it?
03:23	<Rycher>	hmmm... well this person on the fourms told me to run it in "super user" mode. Any ideas?
03:23	<ffm_>	shane2peru, http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/
03:23	<Seven_Six_Two>	I noticed they're getting hammered. I had to edit my hosts info just to update
03:23	<maco>	j_humphrey: whatss up
03:23	<MachinTrucChose_>	hardyone: are the microsoft core fonts copyrighted then? ie, they can't be used in the US without breaking the law (however trivially)?
03:23	<underdog5004>	lopin, why would there be? obviously there's going to be a slowdown when a new release comes out...
03:23	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, Mhm.
03:23	<dbristow>	I'm getting this md5sum for wubi.exe: a96aa69961f3ed80dd7a88fae1e28196  wubi.exe
03:23	<nickrud>	Skuller nothing wrong with 7.04, and it has 6 more months of support
03:23	<shane2peru>	ffm_, thanks!, checking it out.

03:23	<lopin>	underdog5004: This is not a slowdown.  This is a grinding halt
03:23	<j_humphrey>	maco: So i think that the iwl3945 driver and my router are incompatible
03:23	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, at least they cannot be redistrubuted. You need a MS licence.
03:23	<ffm_>	shane2peru, No problem.
03:23	<HardyOne>	MachinTrucChose_: something like that but doubt Bill is going to knock on your door
03:23	<Stroganoff>	MachinTrucChose_ msttcorefonts are freeware, extracted from MS freeware

03:24	<Kl4m>	eklof: It really shouldn't be more dangerous than, say a debian dist-upgrade. Many entreprise users are going to upgrade from an LTS to another (not today!)
03:24	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, Technically a violation, but unlikely to prosicute.
03:24	<lopin>	underdog5004: And, I'm trying to upgrade from the alt cd, but it keeps locking up...
03:24	<underdog5004>	lopin, ime, it's been a slowdown...I tried to install libk3b2-mp3 on my gf's lappy...took nearly 5 minutes before it could fetch the package
03:24	<genie>	hi all
03:24	<underdog5004>	lopin, where does it lock up at?
03:25	<genie>	I am getting this error when I try to run sudo command: sudo: unable to resolve host genie02
03:25	<lopin>	underdog5004: Package manager
03:25	<Seven_Six_Two>	lopin, while it's fetching the package lists?
03:25	<lopin>	underdog5004: I switched to a local server, and I could at least get the lists, bu tnothing else...
03:25	<Kl4m>	MachinTrucChose_: those fonts have been given by microsoft "in the interest of interoperability". Sourceforge hosts them
03:25	<shane2peru>	ffm_, WOW double thanks, apt on CD looks really cool, I'm liking it  Thanks a bundle!
03:25	<Gman99999>	my sound is all messed up now that I upgraded to hardy heron, the sound is all raspy and ruffled, why is that?
03:25	<lopin>	underdog5004: Maybe?  It's at the end, but it locks up while offline too...
03:25	<dbristow>	whereas the MD5SUMS file has this line: cdd32124f23b455b0aa22cc3ff35ff35 *wubi.exe

03:25	<gvieira>	sry if this question was previously answered, but how can I upgrade from a 8.04 beta version to LTS final??
03:25	<TheDukeNY>	Does 8.04 no longer include ntfs support?
03:25	<ffm_>	Gman99999, Uh, I wouldn't know  unless you gave more information.
03:25	<shane2peru>	ffm_, ha ha ;)
03:26	<lopin>	underdog5004: "Checking Package Manager"
03:26	<ffm_>	gvieira, use the update manager.

03:26	<ubotu>	x3n0: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
03:26	<HardyOne>	gvieira: if you did the update yesterday you are already there :)
03:26	<MachinTrucChose_>	kl4m: thanks. in that case, why not include them in Ubuntu? I can see why they wouldn't be in Gobuntu, but Ubuntu doesn't seem to mind optional "restricted" packages
03:26	<Seven_Six_Two>	TheDukeNY, try the 3g drivers
03:26	<blankhead>	why is it that without nvidia driver disabled the resolution reaches 76hz but while its enabled it only stays within the 50hz i thought it was suppose to be the other way around!!

03:26	<underdog5004>	lopin, weird, I remember it locking up briefly (10 minutes or so) on an older version when it was trying to get updates before rebooting...
03:26	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; just booted up my live CD, works perfectly.
03:26	<Gman99999>	ffm_ its just sounds all garbled now, im not sure how that could happen it sounds like there's static now in every single sound
03:26	<underdog5004>	genie, long time no see!
03:26	<DBautell>	bcardarella, sounds like an accessibility setting
03:26	<lopin>	underdog5004: I'll just let it sit then
03:27	<ffm_>	Gman99999, Uh, maybe a hardware problem?
03:27	<x3n0>	i'm having a few issues with an alias i've written

03:27	<Gman99999>	ffm_ I just upgrade from gutsy and everything worked fine

03:28	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; nothing.
03:28	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 and ls /dev/sd* should show you the device (if it was recognized) . If there's only one, eject should find it

03:28	<Kl4m>	MachinTrucChose_: I don't know why they are not included. But they are in a exe, and the license told they can't be modified. That's why it depends on cabextract also.
03:29	<HardyOne>	ffm_: lmao you are answering questions to me that I have not asked
03:29	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 but does it show up in /dev/sd*

03:30	<ffm_>	HardyOne, You asked why your numpad was controlling your mouse? (or was that someone else...)
03:30	<nickrud>	x3n0 ok, I see that now. Can't read sed without serious help ;)
03:30	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; it's mount point is /dev/hdc

03:30	<HardyOne>	ffm_: someone else
03:30	<VictorB>	Kl4m, ok i gonna try that
03:30	<ffm_>	favoritefood0, That's not the mount point, that's the device point.

03:31	<VictorB>	Kl4m, canyou try downloading?
03:31	<sammy>	Arnos: I don't think they do booster floopys like that anymore now that they figure everyone can just dl and burn a cd, or that anyone wanting to do that could just make their own bootable floppy. are you still trying to load the update from usb?
03:31	<MachinTrucChose>	ah, much nicer :P
03:31	<favoritefood0>	for nickrud; in other news I looked in /dev/by-id and I see my DVD drive there

03:31	<pawan>	ok

03:31	<pawan>	how is the new version

03:32	<Arnos>	I arbir: I have, it didn't work thought that might have just been the PC I tried it on

03:37	<Kl4m>	Arnos: what is the problem again?
03:37	<arbir>	amenado: i was still on ubuntu 7.10 and i am using what ever version of syslinux that came
03:38	<amenado>	arbir->	then you have to find another tool to make a vfat if gparted dont work for you
03:38	<Shpook>	Well, I'm going to ask this in here then: Are there any issues I should be aware of with the upgrade? Audio, video, network, etc?
03:38	<nickrud>	pawan no trolling

03:38	<arbir>	amenado: let me look around.. if i cannot get anywhere, i will get back here to post my question
03:38	<Shpook>	Although audio is now run by pulse, i'm sure that will be smooth. I'm in love with pulse audio.
03:38	<arbir>	will you be around amenado /
03:38	<Arnos>	Kl4m: The computer can't boot to a USB, any USB, I want a floppy that will let it
03:38	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; in my /var/ folder there is no /dmesg file or folder...
03:38	<ricree>	Shpook: I had some audio issues, but they were easily solved by changing sound from auto-detect to ALSA

03:39	<amenado>	arbir okay, you're welcome

03:39	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ext2 - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
03:39	<ricree>	Shpook: yeah, I was pretty worried though, since I had a lot of sound problems when Feisty first came out
03:39	<Fa>	ubuntu 8 rocks
03:39	<XceII>	ya
03:40	<scorpfromhell>	what is the partial upgrade after upgrade to hardy that's been taking me ages? :(
03:40	<Shpook>	ricree: I solved my sound problems in feisty by installing pulseaudio.
03:40	<nickrud>	scorpfromhell probably slow servers
03:40	<Shpook>	ricree: But yeah, before that I had a lot of problems too.
03:40	<Randocal>	I'm pretty sure I know the answer.... But if I upgrade to hardy, and somehow it breaks something on my system and things aren't working properly there isn't an uninstall option is there?
03:40	<obf213>	hey, i just upgraded, and of course I am having problems, specifically with the apt-get / synaptic
03:40	<Arnos>	Kl4m:

03:40	<Arnos>	1)I want to boot Ubuntu on my USB
03:40	<Arnos>	2)the computer can't boot to USB normally
03:40	<Arnos>	3)Therefor I need a floppy that will make my computer boot to USB
03:40	<Arnos>	4)The floppy would let the computer access the USB which would then boot
03:40	<FloodBot2>	Arnos: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
03:40	<Fa>	back up your data before upgrading
03:40	<arbir>	amenado: that link is to install ubuntu on my USB flash drive
03:41	<amenado>	arbir correct
03:41	<obf213>	for some reason they are just not working, i cant apt-get it just hang, i can't install packages it just hangs, i can't add reposistories iether
03:41	<arbir>	amenado: i want to make a USB flash drive,, a ubuntu installer
03:41	<scorpfromhell>	no, am not complaining about slow servers, I am expecting that :) hence torrented the alternate cd

03:41	<Shpook>	obf213: What kind of problems? The servers have been extremely slow with the release.
03:41	<ffm_>	obf213: In the mean time, use a mirror.
03:41	<obf213>	Killeroid, is that because of today
03:41	<amenado>	arbir right, and use syslinux to put the loader on it
03:41	<Killeroid>	obf213: yeah, everyone is upgrading
03:41	<fdsjkalf>	i found a mirror that served hardy to me at over 1150KB/s
03:41	<sammy>	obf213: if you can, if you can start synaptic package manager from scratch, before doing anything else, go into the repository setup and have it find the best mirror for you.
03:41	<arbir>	amenado... hold on.. let me put syslinux on it
03:42	<obf213>	Shpook, i just cant apt-get or evne add repositories, if thats the case, I have no problem being patient

03:42	<fdsjkalf>	and whaddaya know, it was faaaast
03:42	<Kl4m>	Arnos: When you install Ubuntu on the USB drive. you need to install grub on a floppy. On the last install questions, click "advanced..." and install grub on /dev/fd0

03:42	<Fa>	lol
03:42	<scorpfromhell>	will hardy work for eeepc?
03:42	<pawan>	hello
03:42	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 you have both sata and pata interfaces?
03:43	<Shpook>	obf213: I would suggest waiting until this time tomorrow, maybe even a day longer, then try. I've been having problems grabbing anything from the repos.
03:43	<Kl4m>	scorpfromhell: you'll want xubuntu for a eeepc
03:43	<amenado>	arbir same one
03:43	<ffm_>	!repomirror is Go to "System>Administration>Software Sources" and choose "Other" from the drop down box. Then choose "select best server" and your system will choose the closest mirror to you automatically.
03:43	<Shpook>	obf213: and when I was able to, they only downloaded at ~15kbps.
03:43	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; Yes, my DVD drive is pata, my hard drive is SATA

03:45	<ffm_>	fdsjkalf:  It's an opinion.
03:45	<Killeroid>	fdsjkalf: both are great, depends on personal preference
03:45	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 ok, it looks like your parallel interface is not getting recognized properly, only the hard drive. You should file a bug report, attach that file to it, along with the output of sudo lshw
03:45	<johd>	i completely removed swdec using the synaptic package manager, but FF still uses swdec
03:45	<jordanjay29>	fdsjkalf: Depends on what your preference is. I suggest you try both.

03:46	<dan_l>	Do i need to get the alternate or just the standard image?
03:46	<Kl4m>	scorpfromhell: It seems you can install ubuntu on it, not only xubuntu.

03:47	<DBautell>	dan_l, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
03:47	<fyrfaktry>	I pulled the x64 cd in about 15 minutes
03:47	<ricree>	my numberkeys stopped working after the upgrade.  Does anyone have any idea how to troubleshoot?
03:47	<jordanjay29>	osvin: yes, just install all the KDE packages and libraries. Then log out, select KDE from the Options/Sessions menu, and log in
03:47	<jburd>	Yeah, the torrents are definitely faster.  Don't bother with the HTTP servers dan_l

03:48	<ricree>	JoCoProductions: you might want to try the alternate installer
03:48	<jordanjay29>	fdsjkalf: Give it a few days, it's release day today. Servers are going to be slow for a while.
03:48	<dan_l>	DBautell: ive never booted an alternate CD, does it just leave you with a bash shell?

03:54	<obf213>	i heard a rumor a while ago that ubuntu now had one command to install all the mp3 flash restricted stuff etc
03:55	<jordanjay29>	kilrae: Why don't you mount after installation? So long as you're not installing to that volume
03:55	<Kl4m>	ripps: are you coming from #ubuntu+1 ? if so you've just been redirected to #ubuntu
03:55	<dragobr_>	obf213: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
03:55	<jordanjay29>	obf213: sudo apt-get ubuntu-restricted-extras
03:55	<kilrae>	ah, but what if i am installing to an LVM in that volume
03:55	<Shpook>	ARGH. The anticipation is killing me. Only 5.75 hours left until the upgrade is downloaded.
03:55	<ripps>	oh, I didn't realize
03:55	<jordanjay29>	oops, missed a line, use dragobr's
03:55	<dragobr_>	:)
03:56	<Surrealwraith>	Hey.  Just installed 8.04 on my IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad T60, i386.  When I close the laptop, then open it again, the screen becomes all "messed up" and I need to do a hard system shutdown.  Any suggestions?
03:56	<Shpook>	I'm switching to offtopic to keep this channel cleaner, I'll be back and forth.

03:56	<jordanjay29>	Surrealwraith: Adjust your power settings, I think.
03:56	<Darkphyre>	can anyone please tell me how to force a resolution in this new xorg server? it isn't letting me edit the xorg.conf as much as i used to.
03:56	<famicom>	WHY ARE THESE FSCKING SERVERS DEAD
03:56	<twinkie_addict>	how di enable the desktop cube in 8.04 ?
03:56	<kelvin911>	how many of you here use compiz fusion?
03:56	<nickrud>	famicom cuz everyone (including you) is hammering them ;)
03:56	<jordanjay29>	famicom: it's release day, and thousands of people are trying to download the latest version. Give it a break and come back in a day or so
03:56	<Surrealwraith>	That didn't work when I had the same problem on the beta, but I'll try.  Thanks
03:56	<warriorforgod>	famicom: they are not dead.  Many people are download 8.04 using up a lot of bandwidth.

03:56	<osvin>	kelvin91: I use compiz

03:57	<ubotu>	#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
03:57	<Surrealwraith>	Yeah, the download took hours
03:57	<twinkie_addict>	torent is fast
03:57	<calc>	famicom: aiui the servers do at least several gigabit, so for them to be overloaded means large amounts of people are downloading
03:57	<kelvin911>	osvin: does your video playback flicking sometimes?
03:57	<famicom>	Kl4m does that have the sources
03:57	<Shpook>	CRAP

03:57	<famicom>	calc are you braindead
03:57	<osvin>	kevin911: no
03:57	<milly1234>	twinkie_addict, install compizconfig settings manager

03:57	<johd>	anyone know how i can remove swfdec plugin so that firefox will stop using it
03:57	<szx0>	Is there a way to kick every other users off a server besides yourself ?

03:57	<nickrud>	famicom system->admin ->	software sources , download from : choose other, and a local mirror
03:57	<calc>	famicom: then use a mirror
03:57	<kelvin911>	osvin: it is not that visible sometimes
03:57	<doolz>	Darkphyre, what graphics card?
03:57	<kelvin911>	osvin: but it isnt as smooth as it is in windows
03:57	<nickrud>	!attitude | famicom
03:57	<ubotu>	famicom: The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
03:58	<p28301016>	how can i upgrade to the hardy version with ap-get
03:58	<Surrealwraith>	Mine cut out after 30 seconds.  I called and they said Ubuntu is illegal anyway, so I should stop trying...
03:58	<jordanjay29>	Surrealwraith: You sure? I just adjusted my settings, closed my lid and opened again. It does nothing, as I instructed it too. And, yeah, comcast is a pain in the [you know where] for torrents.

03:58	<Darkphyre>	6600GT, doolz. the drivers are installed. but my monitor isn't being recognized.
03:58	<osvin>	kevin911: Maybe your video card is slow
03:58	<famicom>	Kl4m ah thatnks
03:58	<nickrud>	p28301016 if you want to use the command line, use    do-release-upgrade
03:58	<twinkie_addict>	thanks
03:58	<kelvin911>	osvin: my video card is 7600GT 256mb
03:58	<kelvin911>	it is perfect in windows
03:58	<jordanjay29>	Surrealwraith: Comcast is currently being a [female dog] when it comes to bittorrent.
03:58	<famicom>	calc next time make sure your brain is in gear before engaging mouth
03:59	<kelvin911>	i wonder if it is compiz that is causing it
03:59	<calc>	famicom: if you just use a country code server it probably points back to the main server as well, eg us.archive.ubuntu.com points at archive.ubuntu.com
03:59	<p28301016>	thanks nickruk
03:59	<doolz>	Darkphyre, do you have nvidia-settings installed?
03:59	<Surrealwraith>	Yeah, it's happening again.. I can't even see the window.  Just lots fo lines and colors. brb, need to restat.
03:59	<calc>	famicom: i'm sure i don't know much i only maintain openoffice :-P
03:59	<osvin>	kevin911: I don't know what is the problem
03:59	<nickrud>	calc eh, that's nothing to crow about ;)

03:59	<pawan>	can we install vista on top of ubuntu
03:59	<calc>	nickrud: :-P
03:59	<jwwadk>	does anyone know about brightness sliders not showing up in the gnome power manager?
03:59	<famicom>	calc and i maintain a whole other bunch of packages
03:59	<Shpook>	Real quick, can I just ask everyone to stop upgrading until mine is finished? :-P
03:59	<fyrfaktry>	hush it pawan
03:59	<famicom>	lawl
03:59	<calc>	famicom: i used to maintain about 300 packages
04:00	<jordanjay29>	pawan: No. You can dual boot or overwrite your ubuntu installation.
04:00	<famicom>	calc for ubuntu  or debian?
04:00	<calc>	famicom: but OOo is about equal to all of them combined in pita to do
04:00	<osvin>	kevin911: My Lenovo R61 has Intel x300 video card and run very fine
04:00	<kelvin911>	pawan: or try virtual box
04:00	<calc>	famicom: debian
04:00	<famicom>	ah ok
04:00	<arc_shmoo>	how do you get emerald installed on 8.04?
04:00	<calc>	famicom: but you can look at various packages in ubuntu and see my changelog entries still
04:00	<jordanjay29>	pawan: Oh, sorry, forgot about VMware
04:00	<famicom>	calc well personally i cant stand most of these ubuntards
04:00	<pawan>	i want to keep my existing ubuntu installation and wanna install vista
04:00	<arc_shmoo>	sudo apt-get install emerald doesnt work
04:00	<Darkphyre>	doolz, yes. but it isn't letting me go over 640x480 either.

04:01	<calc>	Kl4m: ah that is good news then :)
04:01	<x1250>	calc, me too :)
04:01	<Liquidy>	Darkphyre:  using 8.04 you cannot change yo res. with a 6600GT?
04:01	<calc>	Kl4m: which is why you should check the ip address :)
04:01	<jordanjay29>	johd: uninstall the package
04:01	<thezanke>	anyone have any idea why all of my windows want to spawn underneath my application bar? thus hiding the ablilty to drag them.. i have to use alt+drag to get them out... the bar is still there... not a windows decoration issue
04:01	<Darkphyre>	Liquidy, yes.
04:01	<johd>	I already uninstalled it
04:01	<x1250>	hey calc, I thought ibex was starting today?
04:01	<mrbird>	how can i go about updating from the hardy beta to the hardy release?
04:01	<XceII>	Darkphyre:  try   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg       at your next boot
04:02	<calc>	Kl4m: not sure why we don't have a mirror in the US (or didn't last time I checked) that is pointed to by us.a.u.c
04:02	<orthodoc>	my grub menu still displays the developmental branch...
04:02	<nickrud>	mrbird just start the update manager
04:02	<Liquidy>	you're using those "Restricted" drivers?
04:02	<Darkphyre>	yes
04:02	<szx0>	I am trying to perfom a netinstall... All online tutorials explain how to do this with "dnsmasq" .... I am using bind9, any links?
04:02	<jordanjay29>	johd: how about from the Firefox plugins area?
04:02	<lee_>	Is there no #Ubuntu+1 yet?
04:02	<orthodoc>	does it mean i am not upgraded??
04:02	<osvin>	kevin911: I enabled extra effectds
04:02	<moon2js>	my upgrade to Hardy from Gutsy hangs at "Preparing to install." I've tried upgrading from an alt cd and from the repos, but both hang at the same part. Any ideas? I'd rather not do a full reinstall if possible.
04:02	<calc>	x1250: well it should start by next week anyway since toolchain is noted to be uploaded by then
04:02	<nickrud>	orthodoc no, just means you have the latest kernel
04:02	<calc>	x1250: as soon as it is I will be uploading OOo 3.0 beta (assuming it builds)
04:02	<johd>	lets see
04:02	<kelvin911>	i wonder how to make new open window spawn on top of the screen instead of at the bottom of the screen
04:03	<mrbird>	nickrud: thanks
04:03	<nickrud>	orthodoc try lsb_release -a ,
04:03	<kelvin911>	because the docking icons are on the way most of the time
04:03	<Liquidy>	Darkphyre: can you lspci and paste the "video" line here?
04:03	<calc>	x1250: OOo 3.0 beta is supposed to be out on Apr 30
04:03	<Kl4m>	calc: what are those us.a.u.c servers anyway? dedicated for ubuntu?
04:03	<arc_shmoo>	so... you cant install any of the normal apps on 8.04 yet i guess
04:03	<x1250>	calc, great
04:03	<PMantis>	I can't get the dvd IDO torrent file from here... any other links?  http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/hardy/release/ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i386.iso.torrent

04:03	<orthodoc>	thanks nickrud
04:03	<calc>	Kl4m: there are no us.archive.ubuntu.com servers really, they are the same ones in London that are the main archive
04:04	<mortal1>	I was wondering, given that many documents are displayed best at 8.5 x 11 format, is there any way to quickly grow the window to that size?
04:04	<orthodoc>	i'll try that...
04:04	<Kl4m>	calc: oh that's bad...
04:04	<calc>	Kl4m: it just happens that the London colo has really good bandwdith
04:04	<szx0>	I am trying to perfom a netinstall... All online tutorials explain how to do this with "dnsmasq" .... I am using bind9, any links?
04:04	<nickrud>	one off topic question: calc does the beta handle office docx/xlsx better now? (please, please say yes so I don't have to run the darned vm as much)
04:04	<ricree>	When I try to enable normal desktop effects, it says "The Composite Extension is Not Available".  Any suggestions?
04:04	<kelvin911>	which picture viewer is the best?
04:04	<calc>	nickrud: no idea, i haven't tested it yet
04:04	<arc_shmoo>	﻿jordanjay29: wine and emerald so far im sure ill find more as i try to get it up to date but ive had it up for 30 min so far
04:04	<kelvin911>	i want something similar to ACDSee 2.4
04:04	<Darkphyre>	Liquidy: there is no "video" line
04:04	<calc>	nickrud: 3.0 will be the first time upstream OOo supports Office 2007 formats at all though
04:04	<Fdisk_>	does anybody have any idea how to fix this crazy resoloution problem ??
04:04	<kelvin911>	but all picture viewer i try dont open image at normal size
04:05	<calc>	nickrud: i'm sure it will take a while to shake out most of the bugs

04:05	<Kl4m>	Fdisk_: restate please?
04:05	<nickrud>	calc I'll have to try, all but one person in my office kindly uses the old format to humor me
04:05	<MattJ>	arc_shmoo: sudo apt-get install emerald works for me (8.04)
04:05	<johd>	installing adobe plugin fixed it i suppose
04:05	<johd>	thanks
04:05	<jordanjay29>	arc_shmoo: I've got both wine and emerald installed now. Use Synaptic
04:05	<jordanjay29>	johd: glad you could get it working
04:05	<PMantis>	An live link available for this?  ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i386.iso.torrent

04:08	<DBautell>	PMantis, ftp://lug.bu.edu/pub/distro/ubuntu/
04:08	<Fdisk_>	????
04:08	<calc>	nickrud: you can also if you feel like it install upstream OOo for Linux (or Windows) and file bugs directly in official OOo issue tracker, to take Ubuntu out of the loop, which does slow down response a bit
04:08	<orthodoc>	nickrud: possibly the servers are running full steam...so all the upgrading is taking time

04:08	<]grimm[>	Are there any known issues with Hardy and nvidia cards?  I just installed Hardy without a hitch in three 64 bit machines with nvidia cards but it's hanging up on an i386 install (which was working fine in Gutsy).  I can't seem to use the restricted (non-free) nvidia driver (preferable) nor can I use the nv driver, it just keep taking me back to the "safe mode" screen.  Any ideas?
04:09	<kelvin911>	should i cancel or disable quick search .  please see http://img167.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot1dd3.png

04:09	<calc>	nickrud: if you do that though make sure they understand you are using their version of OOo instead of Ubuntu (or they will probably close the bug)
04:09	<latitu>	some thing fishy is going on.. i upgraded to hardy beta a week a go. and from 2 days ago. adept said iam fully updated. today hardy is released and adept (apt) still saying iam upto date...  ?
04:09	<rodolfo>	hi folks; I'm trying to upgrade Ubuntu from the cd but once the cd is inserted no upgrade dialog window pops up...what should I do?
04:09	<milly1234>	ricree, if you have an nvidia card I had to install nvidia-glx-new, if you have something newer, nvidia-glx for something a little older, and nvidia-glx-old for older cards
04:09	<calc>	nickrud: before i report any bugs upstream i have to verify them against the official OOo build, which is part of the reason it takes extra time
04:09	<IcemanV9>	orthodoc: oh. modules. ah. that is different. gotcha. my mistake.
04:09	<PMantis>	DBautell: Thank you, but that's still just desktop and alternate, NOT the dvd iso torrent.
04:09	<pipegeek>	clicking "cancel" has no effect.
04:10	<nickrud>	calc I don't file bugs there, I just check to see if they exist. If they do, I tend to leave them alone (unless there's a patch that hasn't made it into ubuntu)
04:10	<sahak>	where can I find statistics about how many Ubuntu iso images have been downloaded? and in general some statistics about how many Ubuntu users there are?
04:10	<calc>	nickrud: ok :)
04:10	<pipegeek>	should I just not be using the upgrade tool?
04:10	<snadge>	my father has a problem installing 8.04 on an amd/nvidia motherboard.. apparently the IDE drive shows up as scsi now, and at the point where ubuntu tries to format the swap partitions (it gives you no choice not to) it fails.. and loops back to the partitioning part whether you select "go back" or "continue" .. any advice?

04:10	<DBautell>	PMantis, you're right, sorry...
04:10	<milly1234>	ricree, sorry for the delay, I am lagged pretty bad because of a lack in bandwidth
04:10	<Kl4m>	ricree: instead, go to system ->	administration ->	hardware drivers and install the nvidia stuff
04:10	<nickrud>	calc been using debian since 2001, I am very aware of 'politics' ;)
04:10	<calc>	nickrud: ah :)
04:10	<dragobr_>	titu: thats normal...
04:10	<arbir_>	can anybody tell me what is this version number ? Version: 1:3.36-4ubuntu5
04:10	<calc>	nickrud: i used it since jul 98 and a DD since jul 2000
04:10	<arbir_>	is this version 1.3 ? or 3.36 ?

04:11	<calc>	nickrud: i used to maintain KDE for debian among other things
04:11	<milly1234>	Kl4m, for some reason when I did that it told me it was already installed when it was not
04:11	<Kl4m>	gopp: what an interesting question. I guess it would work
04:11	<snadge>	is there a way you can either skip the swap formatting part during the install? or will i be forced to use alternate installer.. or even a way to disable the IDE drive from showing up completely (its not needed) ?
04:11	<pipegeek>	half the time update-manager freezes as soon as I click the "upgrade" button
04:12	<kelvin911>	is hardy out?
04:12	<Kl4m>	gopp: but why would you do that?
04:12	<nickrud>	calc but I have to admit I broke completely on warty. The promise of a stable unstable was just too alluring
04:12	<rodolfo>	I'm out of ideas could I get some help please?
04:12	<latitu>	some thing fishy is going on.. i upgraded to hardy beta a week a go. and from 2 days ago. adept said iam fully updated. today hardy is released and adept (apt) still saying iam upto date...  ?
04:12	<hylinux>	hi, everyone, how to upgrade my hardy beta version to stable version?

04:12	<gopp>	!wubi
04:12	<ubotu>	wubi is Wubi advice here: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=234  and  http://wubi-installer.org  [file wubi bugs here:  https://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug ] (it is included in hardy 8.04 beta CD and will be in the final release)

04:12	<hylinux>	hi, any idea about my issue?
04:12	<sahak>	http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/ statistics seems to be incorrect. Is there correct torrent statistics for Ubuntu?

04:13	<hylinux>	how to upgrade from beta version to stable version?
04:13	<kelvin911>	last time i try to update wine, it is screwed up
04:13	<Utalcn2me>	how does one get pulseaudio to work?
04:13	<hylinux>	will I change the package source?
04:13	<dragobr_>	latitu: use cat /etc/issue to see if there is no "dev version" printed.. if not, you are using the hardy final.. simply there were no updates on this last two days
04:13	<sahak>	hylinux: I don't think you need to do anything

04:13	<calc>	nickrud: ah
04:13	<PMantis>	Nice, 7 torrents running. Most are done, I'll leave them up to help out.

04:14	<kelvin911>	are there any performance boost?
04:14	<dragobr_>	latitu: the last updated RC version of two days ago is pratically the hardy final
04:14	<kelvin911>	how better?
04:14	<krasher>	hey i can't put my nvidia FX-5200 to work in 1024x768 in Hardy Heron... i've installed the restricted module but i can't choose the resolution on resolution configuration... i used this videocard in Gusty and in Windows at 1024x768 without any problem... when i choose 1024x768, it gives me incorrectly refresh rates... i use 60hz... but i get to choose 51 or 50hz

04:15	<dragobr_>	latitu: yep.. there were no updates on this last two days, just that :)

04:15	<latitu>	dragobr_ thanks
04:15	<rainrunner87>	Hi.  Anyone having any trouble poking the repos?
04:15	<nickrud>	calc I never irc'd until xchat dropped me here. I did bbs stuff a long time ago. I flamed much more effectively than most stuff I've seen on debian-devel. Another reason I changed
04:15	<dragobr_>	latitu: nop
04:15	<krasher>	which nvidia tools?
04:15	<kelvin911>	can someone post the DVD iso or CD iso to rapidshare?
04:15	<Fdisk_>	i got the book right with me
04:16	<latitu>	dragobr_ nop ?
04:16	<HardyOne>	PMantis: I am downloading torrent now
04:16	<DBautell>	PM, it took a long time to break 30k over here... It's still not up to speed, really
04:16	<sahak>	kelvin911: Firefox 3 for example.
04:16	<Kl4m>	kelvin911: it's too big.
04:16	<ryanhedge>	Hello there I just installed Xubuntu 8.04 but it seems a ton of packages are missing. Also I can't seem to update my repository. Is this due to heavy traffic?
=== dragobr_ is now known as dragobr_out
04:16	<kelvin911>	i think ubuntu should post their file on rapidshare  or sites like that
04:16	<blueeyesmike>	Hi, just upgraded and I've noticed that now my power button and closing the lid on my laptop don't do anything? The event gets logged in /var/log/acpid but nothing happens. This is on a dell inspiron 6000
04:16	<chai_>	hi all... sound issues here... audacious, my music player, works fine, but nothing else has sound
04:16	<osmosis>	still no luck for me on ubuntu 8.04 with nvidia
04:16	<dragobr_out>	latitu: it was nothing.. glad to help
04:16	<PMantis>	HardyOne: Thanks! It's up to 64 days now. :(
04:16	<krasher>	i only have to choose nvidia-xconfig and nothing more... i'm a completely n00b at ubuntu... but i'm not blind to have to use it at 640x480
04:16	<kelvin911>	it is way faster to download from rapidshare
04:16	<nickrud>	calc anyway nice talking to you. </offtopic>	;)
04:16	<sahak>	kelvin911: why can't you use bittorrent?
04:16	<chubs730>	krasher: open a command line and type sudo nvidia-glx-config
04:16	<kilrae>	bah, no wireless
04:16	<mindframe>	how do i get the networking applet to appear ?
04:16	<pipegeek>	Yeah.  It's trying to connect to 91.189.92.2, which whois tells me is owned by canonical, and just sitting there.  Any way to change this behavior?
04:16	<kelvin911>	because rapidshare is way faster
04:16	<chai_>	mindframe, launch application nm-applet
04:16	<krasher>	chubs730: i don't have this program
04:16	<Kl4m>	kelvin911: Does rapidshare accept 700MB file even with an ultra-super-premium account
04:16	<osmosis>	how do I get my driver to show in System ->	Hardware Drivers. It doesnt show anymore since I tried to install nvidia-glx manually with synaptic.
04:17	<sahak>	kelvin911: there are thousands of seeder on bittorrent right now, I don't think you will have problems with speed.
04:17	<kelvin911>	u can cut it up to seven 100 mb files
04:17	<nickrud>	kelvin911 you should try the torrents, they are really good right now
04:17	<orven>	any suggestions on a good newsreader/nzb downloader?
04:17	<Jasone>	does anyone here have vnc4serever going on xubuntu 8.04
04:17	<nickrud>	orven pan is best of breed in linux
04:17	<kelvin911>	i can download 7 100 mb files in 15 minutes
04:17	<chubs730>	krasher: and you've installed the nvidia drivers? perhaps it's different on 8.04, i'll see if i can find anything
04:17	<Adriana_Bestova>	hi
04:17	<Kl4m>	kelvin911: oh please. there are enough mirrors already. if all else fails use a canadian mirror
04:18	<HardyOne>	PMantis: going to take a couple hours or so to start seeding though :/
04:18	<arbir_>	i keep getting this error
04:18	<arbir_>	Partition isn't marked bootable!
04:18	<PMantis>	kelvin911: Perhaps I'm on the wrong torrent? ubuntu dvd i386?
04:18	<calc>	nickrud: ok
04:18	<sahak>	kelvin911: can you try bittorrent and tell us what speed you are getting?
04:18	<orven>	i downloaded ubuntu 8.04 from usenet in about 4 minutes...
04:18	<aslaen>	hey guys.... are the servers just hammered because of the release of hardy or what? when I try to aptitude update, it says it can't contact hardy-backports repo as well as other repo's, but it is contacting some of them...
04:18	<kelvin911>	download dvd iso with bt is slow
04:18	<nickrud>	arbir_ that makes no sense, it doesn't matter to linux if the partition is bootable. Where do you see that?
04:18	<Kl4m>	PMantis: did you get it from ubuntu.com or elsewhre
04:18	<blankhead>	man the nvidia-settings plugin helped me out alot i was messing with the xorg...why dont u guys include that when u enable nvidia driver....u should have that setting installed automatically i could've saved hours of my time
04:18	<krasher>	chubs730: i've installed the restricted module... but when i go to resolution configuration, i got incorrect refresh rates

04:21	<calc>	dini: there shouldn't need to be any, it is already fast, if you are having slowdown problems it is probably either your connection or the site you are trying to reach
04:21	<kelvin911>	like more of what software?
04:21	<mvinsc>	my nvidia drive just installed and said reboot
04:21	<Kl4m>	kelvin911: more packages but you likely won't use most of them.
04:21	<chubs730>	krasher: is that already installed?
04:21	<Skuller>	Hello, I get this in Synaptic "E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
04:21	<Skuller>	E: Unable to lock the list directory
04:21	<krasher>	FINALLY!
04:21	<pipegeek>	nickrud: I already did.  I'm not using ftp.us.ubuntu.com.  It's downloading something from there anyway, and I can't dissuade it.
04:22	<Mythril>	are there any packages out there that automatically mirror two folders when one of them changes?
04:22	<calc>	dini: but i am not sure what you are trying to do about speed? is something slow for you?
04:22	<sahak>	Ubuntu repositories have about 20 thousand packages, while CD has only about 1 thousand.
04:22	<krasher>	thanks for that tip of nvidia-settings...
04:22	<pipegeek>	nickrud: I only know this from the strace output.
04:22	<arbir_>	nickrud: i get this error now ->	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64305/
04:22	<krasher>	i proper configured the refresh rate
04:22	<ere4si>	avayanis_: you prob need the 386 kernel instead of the server kernel
04:22	<Kl4m>	Mythril: rsync
04:22	<iDN>	oh, boy, was i stupid...
04:22	<iDN>	i hate upgrading!
04:22	<yuri_>	hey guys, noticed the automatix2 is discontinued. is there an alternative, or an easy to use instruction page that would allow someone quick access to the win32 codecs, libdvdcss, flash, truetype, etc?
04:22	<kelvin911>	CD has 1000 packages?
04:22	<iDN>	:(
04:22	<krasher>	thanks blackhead
04:22	<kelvin911>	wow
04:22	<aoeuid>	how do I get update-manager to use a custom directory for temporary files?
04:22	<pipegeek>	nickrud: but the manifestation of this problem is that it just sits there, on the first screen after you click "upgrade", "downloading file 1 of 2"
04:22	<blueeyesmike>	﻿Hi, just upgraded and I've noticed that now my power button and closing the lid on my laptop don't do anything? The event gets logged in /var/log/acpid but nothing happens. This is on a dell inspiron 6000 any ideas?
04:22	<avayanis_>	ere4si should I download the desktop version and reinstall?
04:22	<dini>	im using 20GB older hard-disk type there may be any problem with that one
04:23	<avayanis_>	or is there a way to select that during the install?
04:23	<Kl4m>	Mythril: you can use rsync locally as well as remotely (via SSH)
04:23	<dini>	calc im using 20GB older hard-disk type there may be any problem with that one
04:23	<nickrud>	pipegeek hm. I didn't realize it did that ... I had to change mine to get any speed. Didn't have any holdups
04:23	<ozzloy>	so cube effects work with flash videos, but not stuff in mplayer.  how do i fix that?  (yes i googled for it already)
04:23	<Kl4m>	Mythril: and it's already installed. man rsync
04:23	<aoeuid>	anyone have any idea?
04:23	<iDN>	here's a question: what is the equivalent of uTorrent on ubuntu?
04:23	<calc>	dini: not sure, if your computer is slow overall it will make everything slow including browsing though, not much that can be helped with that software-wise
04:23	<ere4si>	avayanis_: you can boot the server cd - choose rescue - then   sudo apt-get install linux-image-386
04:23	<sahak>	iDN: transmission
04:23	<tarkus>	i want to use ubuntu for my server, but it has caused nothing but problems.. i get hundreds of locale and perl warnings, postgres doesnt work, there arent any logs, nothing is working, simply put. is there any reason why fresh installs of ubuntu would be so shit right out of the box?
04:23	<Skuller>	Does someone have any idea as to how this can be solved:
04:23	<Skuller>	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
04:23	<Skuller>	E: Unable to lock the list directory
04:24	<Kl4m>	Mythril: (sorry last one :) )  there is also grsync which is a graphical frontend to it, and some others.
04:24	<nickrud>	arbir_ you can't use a fat 32 partition probably.
04:24	<chubs730>	skuller: are you running with sudo?
04:24	<Starnestommy>	tarkus: it depends. Was it 7.10 or 8.04?
04:24	<dini>	oh thanks for ur information
04:24	<iDN>	sahak: thanks. it has upload support, right?
04:24	<Mythril>	Kl4m: thank you
04:24	<tarkus>	Starnestommy: 7.10
04:24	<arbir_>	nickrud:  which partition
04:24	<avayanis_>	ere4si: thanks, I will go try that now
04:24	<Skuller>	chubs730: Its synaptic package manager
04:24	<pipegeek>	nickrud: huh.  It finally got past that point.... the strace output shows about 500 calls to read, all of them returning EAGAIN
04:24	<sahak>	iDN: yes
04:24	<osmosis>	dont tell me I need to format and start over just because Hardware Drivers no longer wants to show my nvidia driver.
04:24	<nickrud>	Skuller you have another manager open
04:24	<kelvin911>	i think i will stick with 7.10 for now
04:24	<DBautell>	Skuller, do you have more than one package manager happenong at the same time?
04:24	<nickrud>	Skuller or the update manager is running in the background
04:24	<juano__>	are the repos for hardy down or something ?
04:24	<black_13>	Mythril, nom
04:24	<CaptainMorgan>	after trying to enable all the repositories, multiverse, universe etc... when I reload synaptic or the Add/Remove program, the reloading fails at Translation_En    what's happening?
04:24	<chubs730>	skuller: is there another package manager running?
04:24	<kelvin911>	until maybe i really need to update it
04:24	<dini>	hey calc ru using torrent now days
04:24	<icesword>	kelvin911, hahah, you wil regret
04:24	<zoidberg>	IcemanV9, i got some dependecy errors
04:24	<iDN>	ok. thank you! are you israeli accidentally, sahak ?
04:24	<zoidberg>	?
04:25	<icesword>	kelvin911, lol
04:25	<Starnestommy>	juano__: a lot of the servers are having load problems with all the updates
04:25	<osmosis>	damn
04:25	<sahak>	iDN: Armenian :)
04:25	<calc>	dini: i downloaded the dvd before it was released and then just rsync'd it
04:25	<Skuller>	chubs730: No, only one
04:25	<kelvin911>	icesword: hey u
04:25	<Kl4m>	juano__: the main servers are under heavy pressure. use a local (non-us, non-uk) one if you can
04:25	<kelvin911>	icesword: why regret?
04:25	<calc>	dini:  it was already up to date so it didn't download anything at all
04:25	<black_13>	nickrud it finally scanned the mirror
04:25	<nickrud>	pipegeek to be honest that's over my head.
04:25	<Fa>	Kl4m i just ping all servers
04:25	<icesword>	kelvin911, it is cool, compiz is default in hardy
04:25	<sahak>	iDN: but sahak is a Jewish name (comes from itzhak)
04:25	<pipegeek>	nickrud: thanks anyhow
04:25	<juano__>	Kl4m: lol, silly me :) your right
04:25	<kilrae>	try the canadian arctic one, i'm getting 830K/s
04:25	<juano__>	Kl4m: thanks
04:25	<kelvin911>	icesword: compiz also default in gutsy
04:25	<nickrud>	pipegeek I do obvious shti ;)
04:25	<nks_>	Hey, anyone using a Mac / vmware + ubuntu 8.04 ?
04:25	<Skuller>	Ahh its working now. Don't know what caused the problem

04:26	<arbir_>	Error: The flag 'boot' is not available for loop disk labels.
04:26	<nickrud>	Skuller probably update manager running in the background
04:26	<Fa>	nks you can install ubuntu on a max
04:26	<chubs730>	skuller: apt may be loading in the background, give it a couple minutes
04:26	<icesword>	kelvin911, hahah, don't regret... oh upgrade later, coz now is slow
04:26	<Fa>	mac
04:26	<Fa>	even
04:26	<Fa>	lol
04:26	<chubs730>	oh i see haha
04:26	<iDN>	sahak: i see. are you jewish? and you're correct in your assumption, your name triggered my question. :)
04:26	<kelvin911>	icesword: do u play games?
04:26	<dini>	hey calc come to the private chat room
04:26	<pipegeek>	hah.  "Can't install ubuntu-desktop.  File this as a bug."
04:26	<calc>	generally if you download the test image from the day or two before release it will have little if anything to update via rsync to have the final image
04:26	<CaptainMorgan>	after trying to enable all the repositories, multiverse, universe etc... when I reload synaptic or the Add/Remove program, the reloading fails at Translation_En    what's happening?
04:26	<nks_>	Fa - natural / without vmware ?
04:26	<calc>	dini: which one?
04:26	<twinkie_addict>	man hardy feels alot lighter then previous aditions
04:26	<Fa>	yes i believe so
04:27	<sahak>	iDN: no, I am not Jewish. I am Armenian.
04:27	<iDN>	sahak: is it contradictory? :O
04:27	<icesword>	kelvin911, not now
04:27	<tarkus>	nks_: yes, you can
04:27	<dini>	hey calc come the private chat room

04:27	<CaptainMorgan>	after trying to enable all the repositories, multiverse, universe etc... when I reload synaptic or the Add/Remove program, the reloading fails at Translation_En    what's happening?
04:27	<calc>	dini: you didn't tell me which one to come to, so how can I read your mind?
04:27	<aoeuid>	hey, could anyone help me install hardy? :(
04:27	<nks_>	WOW, i never knew that - I always thought you needed vmware - Would you happen to know if there's support for the internal camera?

04:28	<WhoNeedszzz>	Hey guys, when I idle and come back to my computer the "X" process is at around 100% processor usage, what gives?
04:28	<Flannel>	rainrunner87: The repos are being hammered, it's normal, just be patient
04:28	<Starnestommy>	rainrunner87: the servers are having load problems due to 8.04's release
04:28	<HardyOne>	rainrunner87: they are being hammered right now
04:28	<sahak>	iDN: what? having a Jewish name? not really. many Armenians have Jewish names.
04:28	<CaptainMorgan>	Translation-en_US fails!?
04:28	<dini>	just right click on my name and select private chat
04:28	<CaptainMorgan>	help?
04:28	<rainrunner87>	Kay, good to know.
04:28	<rainrunner87>	Thought so.

04:29	<nickrud>	arbir_ arbir_ first, because the instructions pointed to that. Second, the boot sector isn't in dev/sdb1, but on /dev/sdb
04:30	<nickrud>	arbir_ and third, I just tested it :)
04:30	<iDN>	sahak: no, i thought you were implying that being jewish and being armenian is contradictory. apparently, it was a misunderstanding. and yes, i am jewish. :)
04:30	<arbir_>	nickrud:  so what exactly is /dev/sdb ?
04:30	<calc>	kelvin911: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/804features/

04:30	<matt_>	hey, whenever I run apt-get install something on 8.04, I get a bunch of perl locale errors
04:30	<harriseldon>	CaptainMorgan are you behind a proxy?
04:30	<pipegeek>	Okay, this is just ridiculous.  The upgrade tool says my system is up to date, and I'm certainly not running hardy.
04:30	<nxusr>	anyone seen this : "Flash Player: Warning: environment variable G_FILENAME_ENCODING is set and is not UTF-8" ?
04:30	<c0mp13371331337_>	271MB over a crawling server.....
04:30	<nickrober>	Utalcn2me: what happens with your sound? no sound, scratchy, skips?
04:30	<arbir_>	nickrud:  should i make a ext3 partition ?
04:30	<nickrud>	arbir_ the device itself. sdb1 is the first partition on the device. There's always some empty space at the beginning of the device (outside of sdb1) for the mbr and boot flag
04:31	<CaptainMorgan>	harriseldon, no... but I waited it out... out of 62 files, it finally downloaded the pacakages..... however Tranlation-en_US(4 of them) explicitly Fail
04:31	<calc>	dini: i can't see your messages (i guess?) since you are probably not a registered user on freenode
04:31	<HayHay>	Hi, I downloaded & burned the i386 DVD version today - Just did a live boot - Doesn't look much different than the Final release. - Is the difference - that it would have much packages installed so there would not be as many updates to install as doing a CD install?
04:31	<mondayrocks>	most popular channel on freenode.
04:31	<Fa>	lol server is going to get overloaded
04:31	<mondayrocks>	word.
04:31	<Utalcn2me>	nickrober, no volume control for my usb headphones, other than that, everything works with ac97 sound.
04:31	<nickrud>	arbir_ haven't read the instructions for what you are installing. But I was able to toggle the boot flag by doing sudo parted /dev/sdb  with my usbstick
04:31	<bthornton>	Which Ubuntu image should I use for an Intel Core 2 Quad system--AMD64 or i386?

04:32	<harriseldon>	CaptainMorgan according to this https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/synaptic/+question/11830 it is connection related -- could be increased traffic
04:32	<dini>	so what should i do for that
04:32	<Kl4m>	!register >	dini
04:32	<nickrober>	Utalcn2me: oh, mine is just scratchy, like using distortion with an electric guitar
04:32	<kelvin911>	calc: thats it?
04:32	<arbir_>	nickrud:  i am happy.. but just to know, should i keep the USB stick's partition as FAT32 or shall i change it to EXT3 ?
04:32	<calc>	bthornton: amd64 would probably work better for you, especially if you have a lot of ram
04:32	<dini>	how to register
04:32	<calc>	dini: msg nickserv
04:32	<nickrud>	arbir_ what instructions are you following?
04:32	<Starnestommy>	dini: http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup

04:32	<kelvin911>	calc: there is no different from gutsy?
04:32	<anachronoks>	anyone know how to access the compiz settings in hardy?
04:32	<bthornton>	groovy, thanks!
04:32	<calc>	kelvin911: some differences but not a lot of visible ones
04:32	<harriseldon>	arbir_ avoid ext3 on flash (journaling causing extra disk writes)
04:32	<RyanPrior>	Is there a program for doing sound captures of whatever is playing on the computer?

04:33	<Utalcn2me>	nickrober, try turning down pcm maybe, i notice mine distorts when its too high.

04:33	<calc>	kelvin911: the gui looks roughly the same as it has for the past 4 years, it is Gnome after all
04:33	<nhaines>	anachronoks: Go to Add/Remove and install Advanced Desktop Effects.
04:33	<Noah0504>	Can someone who has a little experience with GRUB help me out?  I need help with fixing the following bug filed here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acpi/+bug/214736
04:33	<tarkus>	i want to use ubuntu for my server, but it has caused nothing but problems.. i get hundreds of locale and perl warnings, postgres doesnt work, there arent any logs, nothing is working, simply put. is there any reason why fresh installs of ubuntu would be so shit right out of the box? its the ubuntu server version, and its 7.10 (gutsy)
04:33	<purpleposeidon>	!wubi
04:33	<ubotu>	wubi is Wubi advice here: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=234  and  http://wubi-installer.org  [file wubi bugs here:  https://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug ] (it is included in hardy 8.04 beta CD and will be in the final release)
04:33	<calc>	kelvin911: OOo 2.4.0 instead of 2.3.0
04:33	<arbir_>	harriseldon: then ext2 is fine ?
04:33	<calc>	kelvin911: gnome 2.22.1 instead of 2.20.1
04:33	<Prez00>	wonder if my isp is throttling torrent or this ubuntu torrent is slooow

04:33	<Noah0504>	Prez00: It was pretty slow for me.
04:33	<DBautell>	Prez00, the DVD?
04:33	<calc>	kelvin911: there is a release notes document somewhere that probably lists more stuff
04:33	<WhoNeedszzz>	I have a huge problem with my X process here guys
04:33	<nickrober>	Utalcn2me: i have the volume really low, but it's scratchy constantly, someone else with a computer similar to mine has the same problem on the forums so i guess i'll just wait for a fix :(
04:33	<RyanPrior>	tarkus: That's really strange. My Ubuntu install works fine with Perl stuff, and I'm not using Postgres, but MySQL runs fine.
04:33	<pipegeek>	So, how does the upgrade tool determine which version of ubuntu you have installed?  It thinks I already have Hardy, and it's dead wrong.
04:34	<harriseldon>	arbir_ that should be fine -- are you doing full install to usb or just using a writable partition?
04:34	<Prez00>	regular CD
04:34	<owen1>	"enable automatic login" doesn't work(xubuntu) . any ideas?

04:35	<RyanPrior>	pipegeek: That is very strange. I don't know what the package manager decides based on, but it's clearly screwed up somehow.
04:35	<Adlai>	d4t4min3r: rm -rf /tmp/*, but I wouldn't suggest it, many programs use temp space while they are running
04:35	<arbir_>	when i create it using fdisk, i get different names, when i use parted i dont get such weird names.. what should i use ?

04:38	<goat|work>	HayHay: http://releases.ubuntu.com/
04:38	<WhoNeedszzz>	Flannel, no one can see what i'm saying bc too many people are talking. My repetition is justified
04:38	<compaqr4000>	 I'm trying to run open office calc via ssh and I get the following on one of my machines: /usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice.bin X11 error: Can't open display:  Any ideas why this is?  It works fine on another machine.
04:38	<mib_9lhkzcmz>	Ok. So, I was messing around in the advanced settings of compiz fusion. I didn't change anything major, but it kicked me back to the login screen a couple times, so I put the effects back to simple. Now, whenever I open windows, they leave behind a "ghost" image of themeslves
04:38	<nikitis>	n000b: try mount -t ntfs-3g <device>	<dir>
04:38	<kelvin911>	RodGo: if u dont like emerald, to switch back, gtk-window-decorator --replace & disown
04:38	<Starnestommy>	WhoNeedszzz: how much memory is it using?
04:38	<owen1>	n000b: maybe describe the problem u have.
04:38	<harriseldon>	pipegeek: did you click on the upgrade button next to new distribution available?
04:38	<Adlai>	Utalcn2me: I don't know the pulseaudio control programs, does anyone else know?
04:38	<mib_9lhkzcmz>	Highly Annoying. Any thoughts?
04:38	<nhaines>	WhoNeedszzz: People can use their scrollback buffer to read your question as well.
04:38	<owen1>	n000b: with the folders.
04:38	<kelvin911>	RodGo: work there?
04:38	<WhoNeedszzz>	Starnestommy: how much memory is what using?
04:38	<dublpaws>	compaqr4000: ssh -X into your remote host.
04:38	<Starnestommy>	WhoNeedszzz: X
04:38	<pipegeek>	harriseldon: yes.
04:38	<Kl4m>	zcat[1]: http://releases.ubuntu.com/hardy/MD5SUMS
04:38	<Hikejinx>	RodGo: in ccsm you can set it up to use emerald
04:38	<nickrober>	nhaines: yeah, but it seems to be broken for me
04:39	<n000b>	nikitis: what the heck is that
04:39	<harriseldon>	pipegeek: what happened when you clicked the upgrade button?
04:39	<zcat[1]>	Kl4m: DVD images.
04:39]  * calc uses /lastlog foo :-)
04:39	<nikitis>	how you mount your external windows drive
04:39	<owen1>	n000b: it's a way to mount drives in linux.
04:39	<kelvin911>	nikitis: i think it is automount
04:39	<Adlai>	I don't remember who was asking about finding the fastest mirror, but it's netselect that you want to use, I believ
04:39	<Kl4m>	zcat[1]: did you use a torrent. If so, then it's validated by the torrent protocol.
04:39	<talcite>	oh the distro upgrade? yeah its kinda broken for me as well. Probably due to server load
04:39	<Hikejinx>	RodGo: I believe you can do it under window decorations or some plugin. I'm not using compiz at the moment though.
04:39	<WhoNeedszzz>	Starnestommy: how do i know?
04:39	<nikitis>	kelvin911: not always
04:39	<Adlai>	hopefully you will see that
04:39	<owen1>	n000b: in linux u need to mount drives sometimes.
04:39	<talcite>	I had to try a few times before it let me through
04:39	<zcat[1]>	Kl4m: which are on cdimage.ubuntu.com/dvd/MD5SUM but it just times out for me here.. can anyone else reach it?
04:39	<Starnestommy>	Kl4m: system >	administration >	system monitor
04:39	<calc>	nikitis: usually external drives mount as soon as you plug them in
04:39	<nikitis>	kelvin911: some external drives don't automount
04:39	<kelvin911>	nikitis: it will be if u edit fstab
04:39	<Starnestommy>	er...
04:40	<Starnestommy>	WhoNeedszzz: system >	administration >	system monitor
04:40	<n000b>	owen1: how do you mount the drive again
04:40	<kelvin911>	they do
04:40	<kelvin911>	nikitis: they do all automount
04:40	<owen1>	n000b: let me see his reply.
04:40	<pipegeek>	harriseldon: it sat there for about 10 minutes doing nothing.  Then, I got a dialog which described the upgrade, and I clicked "upgrade" in that window.  Then, another 10 minute wait.  Then the upgrade began, and I was told that it couldn't install ubuntu-desktop, and that this was a bug.  I reran the upgrade tool, and this time, after I got to that point, I was told hardy was already installed.
04:40	<harriseldon>	compaqr4000 is x11 forwarding setup correctly on both machines?
04:40	<n000b>	nikitis: how do you mount the drive again
04:40	<nikitis>	kelvin911: i have one in particular I have to manually mount it
04:40	<kelvin911>	nikitis: make sure u unplug safely in windows
04:40	<n000b>	owen1: ok

04:41	<fmz>	hello
04:41	<kelvin911>	nikitis: i tried that b4
04:41	<zcat[1]>	!md5sums
04:41	<calc>	juano__: use something other than us.archive.ubuntu.com if that is the one you are trying
04:41	<ubotu>	See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes for the md5sums of Ubuntu discs.
04:41	<talcite>	juano__: its probably just slow right now. Everyone's downloading hardy =D
04:41	<mgmz>	it says its using the au sever are any others owrking?
04:41	<WhoNeedszzz>	Starnestommy: it kicks in when i idle
04:41	<mglukhovsky>	i know everyone's really busy right now w/ hardy's release, but does anyone have experience with crashes using ATI's BigDesktop?
04:41	<anachronoks>	i can't tell you how amazed i am at how well hardy is working on my laptop, after all the trouble i went through with feisty
04:41	<juano__>	talcite: yes, oh there we go, now it started to download
04:41	<nickrud>	zcat[1] http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu-releases/8.04/ has the md5sums
04:41	<talcite>	juano__: I'm using one in Quebec. It seems to work well
04:41	<Starnestommy>	WhoNeedszzz: are you using compiz?
04:41	<compaqr4000>	harriseldon: I can assume it is on the server as I can run it on another machine with no issues
04:41	<n000b>	owen1: what do i put in place of device and dir?
04:41	<owen1>	n000b: replace the device with the name of the harddrive, and dir is any directory.
04:41	<anachronoks>	everything works out of the box, a first for me
04:41	<juano__>	talcite: ok, thanks will try

04:42	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about repomirror - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
04:42	<mattycoze>	hey does anyone know how to get the wireless or ndiswrapper to work again in 8.04
04:42	<DBautell>	zcat[1], I fail to find the DVD md5s, bit torrents are checked automatically during the download, so I wouldn't worry
04:42	<Hikejinx>	anacaona: you might just want to wait out the server overload that is going on
04:42	<dini>	how to reset my password
04:42	<ffm_>	nhaines, Go to "System>Administration>Software Sources" and choose "Other" from the drop down box. Then choose "select best server" and your system will choose the closest mirror to you automatically
04:42	<WhoNeedszzz>	Starnestommy: so what does that tell u?
04:42	<dini>	how to reset my password in nickserv
04:43	<zcat[1]>	I should have grabbed them first, I know.. I didn;t expect the server to get hammered to the point that I can't even reach it at all!
04:43	<dini>	how to reset my password in nickserv
04:43	<owen1>	n000b: no. i wanted to follow you first. it's exciting to help people get into open source.
04:43	<ffm_>	dini, Ask in #freenode
04:43	<swilky>	hey all .. i was wondering .. can you setup a linux server to connect on PPoE and use it as a gate way for other computers with internet ip addresses behind it ?
04:43	<Starnestommy>	dini: go to #freenode and ask a staff member
04:43	<MatToufoutu>	hello ubunteros ;)
04:43	<anacaona>	Hikejink: thanks, thought by this evening this would have settled down but I guess not.

04:43	<Starnestommy>	WhoNeedszzz: I'm not sure
04:43	<anacaona>	Hikejink: is there a way to upgrade from CDROM or ISO?
04:43	<fmz>	Could anyone help me with setting xorg right for transperency, i have nvdia and im using xcompmgr. Everything is fine, but its really slow. I added the option for nvdia, still slow.
04:43	<WhoNeedszzz>	Starnestommy: great
04:43	<mglukhovsky>	so no thoughts on dual screen w/ATI (BigDesktop)?
04:43	<ffm_>	nhaines, MIT works for me, but I don't want to spead that around...
04:43	<nhaines>	ffm_: I'm not the one having trouble.
04:43	<mattycoze>	hey does anyone know how to get the wireless or ndiswrapper to work again in 8.04???
04:43	<DBautell>	anacaona, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
04:43	<talcite>	any ideas about what I can remove?
04:43	<kelvin911>	nikitis: did u solve your external hd mounting problem?
04:43	<WhoNeedszzz>	anyone know why the X process usage skyrockets after idling?

04:44	<ffm_>	nhaines, Sorry.
04:44	<rajiv_nair>	where can i find the md5 checksums for 8.04 iso's ?
04:44	<black_13>	were can i find a mirror for sources.list ?

04:44	<hou5ton>	I have a laptop that is a Gateway with AMD Turion 64 mobile technology.  But does it matter which version of 8.04 I download?  Is one better than the other for stability, etc.?
04:44	<zcat[1]>	Oh well, I'll just assume they're correct
04:44	<nhaines>	ffm_: Not a problem.
04:44	<n000b>	owen1: what do you mean the harddrive name?
04:44	<talcite>	Kl4m: 32mb I believe
04:44	<anacaona>	thanks DBautell, I'll give that a try.

04:45	<IcemanV9>	WhoNeedszzz: that might be the reason
04:45	<black_13>	Kl4m, please excuse my ignorance but what is synaptic?
04:45	<nhaines>	nickrober: Probably.
04:45	<n000b>	owen1: yes i do

04:45	<anachronoks>	yes synaptic is not downloading for me either, i gave up on it
04:45	<techno_freak>	nickrober, yes, might be, try the nearest server
04:45	<nhaines>	black_13: It is a graphical interface for the Ubuntu package manager.
04:45	<WhoNeedszzz>	IcemanV9: why?
04:45	<IcemanV9>	WhoNeedszzz: it is being idle and screensaver kicks in

04:46	<techno_freak>	wthww, yes
04:46	<EruditeHermit>	when I use firefox in hardy, everything is set so small because it is not using the correct DPI. Is there a way to set the DPI so that it respects my settings. layout.css.dpi doesn't work.
04:46	<Kl4m>	!upgrade >	wthww
04:46	<nikitis>	i wish the normal cd installer would create lvm's
04:46	<owen1>	n000b: i thought u got only harddrive. and ubuntu machine.
04:47	<black_13>	i inferred that it was probably needed xorg
04:47	<zcat[1]>	YAY! finally got cdimage to load.. md5's are correct!!
04:47	<sahak>	EruditeHermit: Appearance/Fonts
04:47	<Jack_Sparrow>	dini, You will need your old password to reset the account or you will need to see freenode staff
04:47	<mib_9lhkzcmz>	ok. SO I have a frsh install of hardy ^_^. Anyways, I started messing around in some of the advanced features of compiz like desktop cube and whatnot (nothing major). Anyways, I've never had a problem with it in the past, but it kicked me back to the login screen a couple of times. So, I put the settings back to "Simple". Now, whenever I open a window, it leaves a "ghost" image of it's "glide" effect.
04:47	<owen1>	n000b: so u have dual boot?
04:47	<IcemanV9>	WhoNeedszzz: that the box is idling for a long time and screensaver kicks in. so it causes the process high in top
04:47	<mheath>	hmm, does anyone know if there is a release schedule for the first Hardy point release?
04:47	<Kl4m>	wthww: sorry, this is outdated
04:47	<EruditeHermit>	sahak: it is set to my correct value but firefox isn't showing large fonts
04:47	<loufoque>	anyone else has been experiencing numerous crashes in firefox?
04:47	<n000b>	owen1: no i have a live ubuntu cd
04:47	<loufoque>	crashes or heavy slowdowns
04:47	<MatToufoutu>	why does my update blocks always on the last file (the .deb for transmission) ??? i tried many times but still the same... what could i do?
04:47	<techno_freak>	loufoque, its been there for since i started using FF3
04:47	<owen1>	n000b: oh.
04:47	<Kl4m>	wthww: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades?highlight=(hardyupgrades)
04:47	<WhoNeedszzz>	IcemanV9: the screensaver kicks in after 10 minutes but the problem won't occur unless it idles for at least 8 hours
04:47	<wthww>	Kl4m: I already know how to upgrade, The last time I used dist-upgrade on ubuntu (6.06) it messed up, and I learnt the joys of gentoo =p
04:48	<sahak>	EruditeHermit: I don't know then
04:48	<yukonho>	Has anyone had ubuntu fail during the "loading hardware drivers" portion of boot?
04:48	<talcite>	Kl4m: Yeah, I gave /boot 32megs. Is there anything I can remove from it to give it more space?
04:48	<harriseldon>	compaqr4000 have you looked at this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/+bug/136947 there are tips there for debug and possible fixes
04:48	<techno_freak>	loufoque, especially when you open flash
04:48	<mib_9lhkzcmz>	loufoque : nothing yet, but I heven't installed flash yet XD
04:48	<Kl4m>	talcite: remove all the unused kernels
04:48	<owen1>	n000b: what ever u'r doing i think u should be in the ubuntu.
04:48	<nhaines>	black_13: It does.
04:48	<Kl4m>	wthww: the upgrade should be solid now. I had problems with 6.10 too
04:48	<n000b>	owen1: can you wait for me to get into ubuntu
04:49	<n000b>	owen1: it should take about 7-8 minutes

04:50	<RussB>	Hey All - I did an update from a beta version a while ago, but "nvidia" X drivers won't install (I'm using the "nv" now). I'm trying to figure out what's going on now. Is this "common"?
04:51	<talcite>	lol ok
04:51	<kelvin911>	n000b: has problem mounting external HD?
04:51	<harriseldon>	mattycoze are restricted drivers active?
04:51	<owen1>	n000b: my wife will be mad but i'll try to be here.
04:51	<owen1>	n000b: no worries
04:51	<n000b>	kelvin911:  uyes
04:51	<arbir_>	nickrud:  i keep getting this error...
04:51	<arbir_>	Copying live image to USB stick
04:51	<arbir_>	cp: failed to preserve ownership for `/media/usbdev.XS7902/README.diskdefines': Operation not permitted
04:51	<kelvin911>	n000b: what's the problem there?
04:51	<mattycoze>	harriseldon i had a look at that; but i'm not sure whether it worked, can you walk me throught the process?
04:51	<n000b>	owen1: ok thanks man
04:52	<mattycoze>	(and also to check whether it was automatically activated?)
04:52	<sanmarcos>	so anybody updated from 6.06 LTS to 8.04 LTS and like to share an experience?
04:52	<WhoNeedszzz>	does anyone else no about the X process high usage?
04:52	<WhoNeedszzz>	know*
04:52	<n000b>	kelvin911: i have an external usb hdd under windows file system that i cant open on ubuntu
04:52	<harriseldon>	mattycoze I will try my best. First, can you get into the restricted drivers manager?
04:53	<kelvin911>	n000b: did u just unplug it from XP?
04:53	<n000b>	kelvin911: vista
04:53	<WhoNeedszzz>	does anyone else know about the X process high usage?
04:53	<kelvin911>	n000b: did u goto remove USB device in vista?
04:53	<pipegeek>	Heh.  I love ubuntu, and I've been using it since warty.... but I've yet to get an upgrade to work.  And I cannot convince update-manager that it needs to do its job and upgrade me to hardy.  It thinks it already has.
04:53	<nhaines>	n000b: You can't just randomly unplug USB devices from your computer.
04:53	<nhaines>	n000b: Not storage devices, anyway.
04:53	<pipegeek>	For an OS that releases every six months, this is a little sillly
04:53	<black_13>	when i google for mirrors i get download mirros that is places for isos
04:54	<kelvin911>	n000b: u have to do Remove USB device in windows, then ubuntu can auto mount your external
04:54	<neeto>	Well 8.04 officially screwed up everything I had going for me. Sweet.
04:54	<jburd>	bleh. upgrades never work for me.
04:54	<mattycoze>	harriseldon no, it's not in the menu
04:54	<arbir_>	yippeeeee , USB installation works
04:54	<arbir_>	USB key is amazingly fast, no more CD burning for mre
04:54	<jburd>	the installer hangs EVERY freaking time there's a new release.
04:54	<kelvin911>	n000b: try plug it back in to the windows, then remove the usb properly then ubuntu can detect it automatically
04:54	<fiz1>	hey everybody, i have a problem with my on screen volume display, it used to be a small rectangle that appeared when i pressed the volume up button on my laptop, now it is a big square and i want to set it back
04:54	<n000b>	kelvin can we chat directly
04:54	<Jack_Sparrow>	n000b, You can force a mount, but way better to properly close it from windows,
04:54	<mattycoze>	harriseldon; if you mean "Hardware Drivers" i've got that up
04:54	<snadge>	after you've installed ubuntu hardy, how do you tell it to use the generic IDE driver?
04:55	<kelvin911>	n000b: or force mount
04:55]  * grhluna hugs zoidberg
04:55	<nhaines>	fiz1: You can o that by using Add/Remove and installing Advanced Desktop Effects.
04:55	<kelvin911>	n000b: i did that with my 3 external HD
04:55	<mattycoze>	harriseldon; by which in it i've only got the NVIDIA drivers working
04:55	<nhaines>	fiz1: You can turn off the volume control plugin for Compiz there, I believe.
04:55	<cob>	wow wine has gotten really good, didn't even have to mess with any configuration
04:55	<WhoNeedszzz>	does anyone else know about the X process high usage?
04:55	<Jack_Sparrow>	snadge, gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
04:55	<pipegeek>	What does update-manager do that aptitude dist-upgrade doesn't?  Is there a reason not to do that instead?
04:55	<fiz1>	nhaines, i will try that,
04:55	<n000b>	kelvin911: how do i remove the hdd properly?
04:55	<tale_>	what is the name of the new clock applet package
04:56	<harriseldon>	mattycoze it may have changed names in hardy. do you see a placeholder for your 4965 wireless card? if so, is it checked?
04:56	<Mimi>	...Uuuummmm.... how can I stop all desktop icons from showing.... without making my background disapear? Thanks ;p
04:56	<neeto>	My GRUB menu still says 7.10. It's not functionally important, but I want to know how to fix it.
04:56	<snadge>	Jack_Sparrow: yeah but how do i tell it to use generic IDE? i can do it from the install cd.. but not sure what option to put in my menu.lst
04:56	<nhaines>	pipegeek: update-manager passes everything over to a special release upgrade tool that does dependancy checking and so forth.
04:56	<mattycoze>	harriseldon no there is no placeholder for the card :(
04:56	<quentusrex>	Does anyone know about the color bug on hardy? I think it has something to do with either the nvidia driver or something similiar.
04:56	<n000b>	kelvin911:?
04:56	<black_13>	nhaines, how do i find a mirror any mirror whether or not its over burndened or not
04:56	<kelvin911>	n000b: in windows u see arrow icon in system tray?
04:57	<Jack_Sparrow>	snadge, all_generic_ide   before splash quiet
04:57	<n000b>	kelvin911: no i dont
04:57	<kelvin911>	n000b: right click that, then choose whatever device or letter ur usb hd using.  then click remove or whatever
04:57	<pipegeek>	nhaines: doesn't aptitude do dependency checking?  Not to mention, update-manager seems to have screwed up again (happened for gutsy and for feisty, both times had to reinstall), and thinks it's already installed hardy, which it hasn't (no packages installed; lsb_release still says gutsy)

04:58	<quentusrex>	There is something wrong with the video playback on my system. I have hardy from RC fully updated. It has just recently 'broke'
04:58	<Kalimar>	I'm having problems with Samba and HH.  I can have the network and the windows computers enumerated, but not their shares.  There is no message saying that Ubuntu cannot access the shares.  What's the deal?
04:58	<x1250>	ceil420: how are you upgrading?

04:58	<n000b>	kelvin911: done
04:58	<nhaines>	pipegeek: the upgrade tool knows exactly what needs to be done to ensure a proper update, such as removing deprcated packages and so forth.
04:58	<x1250>	ceil420: try # aptitude full-upgrade
04:58	<kelvin911>	n000b: how many computer u have in front of u?
04:58	<n000b>	kelvin911: 1

04:59	<kelvin911>	n000b: r u using windows now or ubuntu?
04:59	<pipegeek>	nhaines: but it's *wrong*.  I mean, it clearly doesn't---it says no upgrade is necessary, and it's wrong about that.  I don't know how it's checking.

04:59	<Zelta>	I have three .odt files I saved as .doc files because I am going to bring them to another computer (Windows XP) to print.  OO.o has different fonts than Windows, so how can I preserve the fonts I chose?
04:59	<nhaines>	pipegeek: I understand that, but that doesn't change that dist-upgrade is not supported.
04:59	<ceil420>	x1250, that's gonna let me get the package, but why is it forcing removal of a different one? "The following packages will be automatically REMOVED:  gtk2-engines-spherecrystal"
04:59	<pipegeek>	nhaines: suggestions?
04:59	<n000b>	kelvin911: yes i do
05:00	<kelvin911>	n000b: and what is it?
05:00	<x1250>	ceil420: thats why it was kept back... because I needed a removal
05:00	<kelvin911>	n000b: u dual boot?
05:00	<x1250>	I/It
05:00	<pipegeek>	nhaines: is there some way at least that I could get debugging output from update-manager?  It doesn't print anything to stdout
05:00	<n000b>	kelvin911: no i have a live cd
05:00	<ceil420>	x1250, ah. cheers o/
05:00	<nhaines>	pipegeek: See what 'lsb_release -r' says, and set your /etc/apt/sources.list back to using gutsy repos.

05:01	<hellmitre>	and I can't connect to wireless networks
05:01	<MrObvious>	How can I request that a program be added to the repos?
05:01	<mattycoze>	harriseldon; also check this http://pastebin.com/m503e74a3 i've added the ifconfig
05:01	<hellmitre>	doesn't recognize that I have a wireless card
05:01	<n000b>	kelvin911: in the external hdd
05:01	<kelvin911>	n000b: i dont get what u mean?
05:01	<pipegeek>	nhaines: lsb_release still says 7.10
05:01	<Kl4m>	ceil420: A package is automatically removed when it was only a dependency on another package which was removed. It then becomes useless
05:01	<Kalimar>	What does it mean when I'm able to see the windows computers listed under network, but when I click on them, the shares are not enumerated and I do not receive an error message?
05:01	<hellmitre>	how would I go about enabling wireless?
05:01	<harriseldon>	mattycoze is your wireless recognized without restricted drivers? do you know how to check?
05:01	<n000b>	kelvin911: can we chat elsewhere pls
05:01	<ceil420>	Kl4m, oh, i see
05:01	<kelvin911>	n000b: so u can see the files in your external in ubuntu?
05:02	<kelvin911>	n000b: whats the problem  then?

05:03	<talcite>	bladezor: you and every other ubuntu user out there right now is hammering the servers. I'd consider 30kb/s fast =P
05:03	<pipegeek>	Is there any supported way to run this upgrade other than through update-manager, which is broken?

05:03	<harriseldon>	mattycoze hate to ask to this question, but is your wireless enabled on the laptop? I have a switch to turn my off and it is not recognized when it is off.
05:03	<owen1>	can i ssh to a machine that have wireless connection?
05:03	<sap>	Hi, while using k3b for burning I had enabled "verify data"  but it ejected the disc soon after writing the data .  Now can I verify the written data separately ?
05:03	<Kl4m>	thezanke: the last kernel version stays so you can use it if the new one breaks for you
05:03	<x1250>	bladezor: thats because you should have download it yesterday. Today is release party!
05:03	<nhaines>	fiz1: It looks like the volume control is actually a GNOME feature when compositing is enabled.  There doesn't appear to be a way to disable it.
05:04	<mattycoze>	harriseldon yeah it's on mate :P
05:04	<bladezor>	x1250: Yeah, shame on me :(
05:04	<compaqr4000>	harriseldon: I've worked my way through your link and all is well.  Thank you for the tip.
05:04	<harriseldon>	owen1 of course

05:04	<milia__>	bladezor, try downloading it using a torrent client, or from a different server, or both.
05:04	<sap>	talcite, nope . the data is a tar archive backup of some of my song files :/
05:05	<owen1>	harriseldon: don't i need static ip for ssh?
05:05	<jburd>	So is "gksudo 'sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade'" supposed to work?

05:05	<talcite>	sap: oh =/
05:05	<Kl4m>	thezanke: you need to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file for this. Let me see the simplest way.
05:05	<harriseldon>	owen1 why do you need a static ip? are you using only preshared keys?
05:05	<moshe>	can someone direct me to a better totorial for fusion?trying to get the cube configured but seem to be doing something wrong
05:05	<x1250>	bladezor: you can change to another mirror
05:05	<led3234>	hello everybody, i am considering switching to ubuntu. i currently use windows (vista, unfortunately), and i was wondering, how jarring is the change? i am not good (at all) with computers, so how easy is it to install/use ubuntu?
05:05	<x1250>	try germany
05:05	<arc_shmoo>	why are all my apt-get commands stalling for a long time at connectiong to *.ubuntu.com (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
05:05	<sap>	talcite, this is weird the k3b knew it had to verify the data but still it ejected ...lol
05:05	<bladezor>	milia__, I'll let it be, it fluctuates quite a bit.
05:05	<Flannel>	led3234: what do you usually use your computer for?
05:05	<Deiz>	So, as with every time I install Ubuntu, windows maximize to both my monitors instead of one. Is there a workaround? I recall with 7.04 I got lucky after a reboot and it started working properly.
05:05	<bladezor>	x1250, yeah I didn't notice how
05:05	<led3234>	mostly stuff like word, powerpoint
05:06	<mattycoze>	harriseldon the card worked on the first fresh install of Hardy, and then when i restarted it wouldn't work
05:06	<led3234>	some profgramming too
05:06	<mattycoze>	which is kidna strange
05:06	<led3234>	and music

05:06	<Flannel>	led3234: listening to music you mean?  and what sorts of languages?
05:06	<nhaines>	led3234: It's actually a quite pleasant change if you mostly do email, browse the Web, and do Office stuff.  You can always download a Desktop CD and try things out a bit without installing.
05:06	<Kalimar>	Pokit: Drop it on the Themes window.

05:08	<ricree>	n000b: as far as I know, the only huge difference is that it uses KDE instead of gnome
05:08	<Kalimar>	Samba trouble.  My windows computers are recognized, but when I click on them, they are devoid of shares.  What's wrong?
05:08	<Kl4m>	thezanke: in the first lines of the file /boot/grub/menu.lst (edit it as a superuser, see !sudo), change the line "default      0" to "default    saved". Reboot, select Windows and from now on it will be the default
05:08	<Flannel>	n000b: They're different.  Neither has advantages per sey, just a matter of preference.
05:08	<nhaines>	n000b: There are no advantages.  It uses the KDE desktop environments instead of the GNOME desktop environment.  It's just about preferences.  They can both run run the same programs.
05:08	<maap_rj>	somebody updated to ubuntu 8.04?
05:08	<talcite>	n000b: its a preference thing. If you're used to KDE, then its better
05:09	<led3234>	oh ok, but i thought there was that new thing in the update (kubi, i think) that lets me run ubuntu from windows (as an application), should i try it?
05:09	<manuel__>	talcite: I have to admit I have no idea what's that

05:09	<Kalimar>	I'm on HH at the moment.

05:09	<maap_rj>	is the 8.04 much better than 7.10?

05:10	<led3234>	do i have to send for the livecd thing, or do i burn it onto a cd?
05:10	<snadge>	i cant figure out how to tell 8.04 to use the generic ide driver after its been installed.. the option i was told to put in menu.lst, comes up with file not found :/
05:10	<x1250>	bladezor: if you find one good enough, dont tell anyone, heh
05:10	<n000b>	kelvin911: are you there?
05:10	<suprie>	can anybody help me to configure my wireless
05:10	<papampam>	anyone here from the philippines? i wish to ask a question
05:10	<ricree>	led3234: you can burn it, the download link should have the iso
05:10	<led3234>	oh ok
05:10	<talcite>	manuel__: k. Yeah, don't use jigdo jigdo. It doesn't work very well yet. Use jigit and then use jigdo-lite (I think that's what its called)
05:10	<Kalimar>	Is anyone an expert on Samba/network configuration?
05:10	<led3234>	thank  you for the help
05:10	<maap_rj>	great, i intend to update my system during the weekend
05:10	<manuel__>	talcite: ok thanks I'll try that
05:11	<talcite>	manuel__: np
05:11	<led3234>	im now gonna go try the wubi (just 'cause it is easier)
05:11	<nhaines>	led3234: Flannel's and my pleasure.
05:11	<n000b>	owen1: are you here?
05:11	<harriseldon>	Kalimar have you checked #samba channel?
05:11	<mgmz>	how come it says lirc is missing in synaptic?
05:11	<Kl4m>	thezanke: you can remove the group of lines for each entry you don't want around the end of that file (oh boy I shouldn't be telling you that)
05:11	<Kalimar>	Nope, is there one?
05:11	<maap_rj>	I really hope not be necessary re-configurate so many things manually
05:12	<harriseldon>	Kalimar yes it is on freenode as well, you just join it
05:12	<Kalimar>	Oh, nice. Thanks harriseldon.
05:12	<Lainy>	i am unable to connect to the Internet in Hardy. Can someone help me out?
05:12	<thezanke>	Kl4m, hahaha dont worry.. I am already backing menu.lst up and have my ultimate boot cd ready..
05:12	<nhaines>	thezanke: the best way is to remove the kernel packages using Synaptic.  It's a good idea to leave the old one around for a week or so, just in case you find any bugs.  :)
05:12	<maap_rj>	this is my first time using a IRC chat... lol it is cool
05:12	<cob>	Larry: what does "ifconfig" say
05:12	<cob>	er Lainy
05:13	<Flannel>	thezanke: You can't remove them permanently, they'll show up as soon as you update your kernel again.  What you want to do is remove old kernel packages, then those entries won't be there anymore.  It's always a good idea to have two kernels (a known good one, and then the new one you just updated to) in case you find bugs
05:13	<pawbie>	Really hating 8.04 atm. :\
05:13	<Kl4m>	nhaines: do they become "autoremovable" after a while?
05:13	<nhaines>	thezanke: Also, remember that PgDn will get you to the Windows XP entry quickly!  Or, you can move Windows XP to the top and change the default boot option from "0" (first) to "1" (second).
05:13	<Lainy>	cob: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4785960#post4785960
05:13	<nhaines>	Kl4m: it seems like they should be.  :)  But I don't recall.
05:13	<Kl4m>	thezanke: their advice is way better.

05:14	<harriseldon>	mattycoze sorry to leave you hanging. have you checked for errors in any of the system logs regarding your wireless. If it worked before, it seems to be a firmware loading issue.

05:16	<Lainy>	cob: OK, I will try that. Is there anything else I should while I use a wired connection?
05:16	<Lainy>	I should do*
05:16	<pawbie>	james296: Search for it in synaptic.  Or "clipboard manager"
05:16	<james296>	I did!!!!!!!!!!!
05:16	<Starnestommy>	james296: do you have the universe repository enabled?
05:16	<harriseldon>	ricree I sometime right-click on the menu item and create a launcher on the desktop, from there I can goto properties and under launcher tab -- command field, I can prepend gksudo
05:16	<nhaines>	ricree: Use the "Unlock" button.

I have recently switched from XP and in XP I used to normally connect using pppoe from each pc using the same modem but not so with ubun
05:21	<nhaines>	MrObvious: Yes, the driver is included but the firmware cannot be redistributed.  Use a wired connection and the Hardware Drivers applet to automatically install the firmware.

05:22	<MrObvious>	You're welcome.
05:22	<juano__>	i am getting a low resolution with hardy heron, i installed nvidia-glx-new already, my monitor seems undetected in xorg.conf, what can i do ?

05:24	<harriseldon>	owen1 if it is a registered domain name with a dns server then you can use the name, otherwise you must know the current ip address. site like dyndns.org allow you to register your own dns for a chaning ip

05:27	<pipegeek>	Interesting.  So, when update-manager fails, do-release-upgrade which uses the same underpinnings, may succeed.
05:28	<Geoffrey2>	what's the command line to bring up bittorrent?
05:28	<Kl4m>	Some_Person: I have the same problem. Likely a firefox bug. It should be dealt with by the release
05:28	<Cl0setheist>	How do i upgrade to hardy properly?

05:28	<nhaines>	pipegeek: did you have luck with that? :)
05:28	<neon>	harriseldon: reading right now thanks
05:28	<Starnestommy>	arooni: now
05:28	<Kl4m>	Cl0setheist: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades . the !upgrade note is outdated.
05:28	<pipegeek>	nhaines: yes.  Which is bloody weird.  Somehow, it decided that there was an upgrade to be done.
05:28	<Flannel>	arooni: now; except you'll be waiting forever on slow mirrors.  Give it a few days.
05:28	<nhaines>	arooni: It should work right now, but I'd advise you to wait a week or at least a couple days.
05:28	<grumbel>	Did anything special happen with the /dev/hd* files? Since it looks like I have lost them all after the dist-upgrade
05:28	<Some_Person>	Kl4m: also my machines hard drive keeps making "loading" noises
05:29	<ripps>	manuel_: after you reinstall fglrx using EnvyNG, try running aticonfig --initial.
05:29	<nhaines>	pipegeek: I'm very happy to hear that.
05:29	<pipegeek>	I didn't know that tool existed.  Good to know.

05:29	<MachinTrucChose>	is there more Compiz effects if I download the Advanced Desktop Effect Settings? Or is the one in Hardy Heron contain everything already?

05:29	<dave11>	through adept
05:29	<Rycher>	What other OS systems are out there that are good?
05:29	<Kl4m>	Some_Person: if you just upgraded/installed, some internal databases are going to update in the first hour
05:29	<pawbie>	Rycher: OS/2 Warp
05:29	<Flannel>	grumbel: Interesting.  Well, for a while now IDE drives have been mapped to SATA drives (sdX instead of hdX), perhaps in Hardy, they don't even show up in the filesystem.
05:29	<Geoffrey2>	if I want to run bit torrent from the command line, what's the command to type in to bring it up?
05:29	<devin_>	gentoo is aright
05:29	<nhaines>	MachinTrucChose: Hardy contains everything, but Advanced Desktop Effects is the interface to customize your effects.

05:32	<pawbie>	coldboot: Oh!  It's called bulk rename.  Should be under system tools, I think (atleast, it is in Debian).
05:32	<Flannel>	grumbel: well, the orders will determine what letters they get, but UUIDs makes it not matter for fstab
05:32	<Diurpaneus>	I have a problem with 8.04. When I start a web page which use flash player I receive an image with play button, how can I remove this play button? Please help!
05:32	<grumbel>	Flannel: not much UUID in my fstab, so my system is pretty wreaked at the moment
05:32	<harriseldon>	Rycher: pawbie was trying to make a joke
05:32	<harriseldon>	r
05:32	<Kl4m>	MachinTrucChose: yes and yes
05:33	<dave11>	is flash built into the live cd?
05:33	<MachinTrucChose>	lk4m: did you fix it?
05:33	<cob>	Diurpaneus: I would remove the free swf player and install adobe's
05:33	<harriseldon>	Rycher are you looking for other distributions of linux?
05:33	<pawbie>	harriseldon: A joke?  OS2 rocks.
05:33	<Kl4m>	MachinTrucChose: I use wicd now. I got fed up with network-manager
05:33	<MachinTrucChose>	ah yes...Wicd is how I fixed it back with 7.10
05:33	<cob>	network manager isn't as horrible as it used to be...
05:33	<mutk>	pawbie, Rocks like the 90's
05:33	<MEtaLpREs>	does anyone know where to change the font dpi in xfce?  my fonts are all way to small to read and i dont see the option anywhere
05:33	<Diurpaneus>	how can I remove the free swf, because I already install adobe
05:33	<manuel__>	ripps: Ok let me see if that works
05:33	<nhaines>	dave11: No.  Try installing Ubuntu Restricted Extras with Add/Remove.
05:33	<dave11>	ok
05:33	<coldboot>	pawbie: Is that called "system-tools"?
05:34	<blmm>	Hi. Do I need to chmod a+w for Samba to be able to write to a directory? Who is the process that does the write running as? I tried to give write access to the group samba, but that did not cut it.
05:34	<pawbie>	mutk: Still rocks...
05:34	<dave11>	nhaines: thanks
05:34	<Miesco>	Is there a hardy channel?

05:34	<harriseldon>	pawbie I am sure it does. You can continue to run it while you bask in the nostalgia. We will stick to modern distributions like BeOS. lol
05:34	<Rycher>	harriseldon: ohhhh i gotcha :D   yeah... basically any thing other then Windows!
05:35	<Miesco>	But I got kicked from #ubuntu-release-party or whatever

05:36	<jeffimperial>	hello.. I'm downloading Hardy via Update Manager, and it's taking too long. I have the alternate ISO but my writers are busted. Was wondering if i could extract the ISO's contents to some directory on my machine so that I get past the downloads quickly, and skip to "Installing the upgrades" part
05:36	<jedimasterk>	1183 out of 1225 fetched and still 2hours to go
05:36	<MachinTrucChose>	ok, I installed CompizConfig, but I don't see any shortcuts. How can I edit the visual effects?
05:36	<LainIwakura>	cob: Hi this is Lainy. b43fwcutter is already installed but ssid does not show up in an iwlist scan.
05:36	<dny>	How can I tell if my system has already upgraded? :/
05:36	<LoLeN>	http://xkcd.com/415/
05:36	<Flannel>	jeffimperial: just mount the iso, yeah.  No need to extract
05:36	<pawbie>	Rycher: Seriously, try Debian.  And SUSE10, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, etc.  Gentoo if you feel like waiting.
05:36	<Rycher>	harriseldon: well has anybody tried ubuntu Studio? I do graphic design (im only 15 yrs old) so i wanna try it.. but get feedback first.
05:36	<grumbel>	How do I get the UUID of a drive/disk?
05:36	<Flannel>	LoLeN: #ubuntu-offtopic

05:36	<kindofabuzz>	any new broadcom wireless fixes yet that work?
05:36	<Rycher>	pawbie: thx man
05:37	<cob>	does your laptop have a physical radio switch or is it software-based with a keystroke or something LainIwakura?

05:40	<harriseldon>	hilts50, let the installer format it

05:41	<dave11>	bladezor: sounds like people are having alot of problems with the new version
05:42	<Sniper606>	it cant get them

05:42	<ripps>	nks_: It won't let install the extension? Did you try firefox's add-on website?
05:42	<pawbie>	hellmitre: Madwifing
05:42	<jeffimperial>	Flannel, how do i get the <mountpoint>	part.. don't u just love being a noob...
05:42	<harriseldon>	jeffimperial the mountpoint is the destination directory. on linux drives are mounted to a directory on the filesystem
05:42	<bullgard4>	mc shows an entry prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). I found that this means a "stale symlink". What is a 'stale symlink'?
05:42	<bladezor>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
05:42	<hellmitre>	I can't get it to function, pawbie
05:42	<hellmitre>	I have recompiled it and inserted it into the running kernel several times
05:42	<hellmitre>	nothin'
05:42	<kindofabuzz>	neeto: get in line, you are only the 1 millionth person doing the same thing
05:42	<harriseldon>	jeffimperial, just create a new directory and use the full path as the mount point
05:42	<neeto>	kindofabuzz: figured it was something like that
05:42	<joetheodd>	Stupid question -- are the repositories down or are they just really bogged thanks to the release today?
05:42	<kindofabuzz>	omg
05:42	<hellmitre>	bogged down.
05:43	<Sniper606>	i think they are down
05:43	<Flannel>	jeffimperial: mountpoint would be an arbitrary place in your filesystem that you wanted the ISO to be mounted to (so you browse to /whatever/your/mountpoint/is/ to view the contents of the CD/iso)
05:43	<pawbie>	Alright, 8.04 must have serious issues with RAID.
05:43	<Sniper606>	im having the repository problem too
05:43	<goat|work>	Sniper606: they are not down
05:43	<nickrober>	you can change them to a different country and they work
05:43	<goat|work>	they are jammed
05:43	<joetheodd>	thanks hellmitre.
05:43	<cob>	pawbie: why's that?
05:43	<nickrober>	i used sweden and i could install fine

05:43	<karllenz>	does hardy come with compiz?

05:43	<kindofabuzz>	anyone got a deb made with the firmware and b43 cutter made up for hardy?
05:43	<nhaines>	Sniper606: It isn't down, it's simply overloaded.
05:43	<karllenz>	nhaines: how do i enable it
05:43	<karllenz>	nhaines: i dont see the custom tab
05:43	<Sniper606>	i need my packages
05:43	<Sniper606>	what can i do
05:44	<nhaines>	karllenz: It should be enabled by default if your hardware supports it.  You'll have a Desktop Effects tab.
05:44	<jeffimperial>	thanks, EVERYONE

05:48	<Guest46686>	or is it my connection
05:48	<crdlb>	Zicks: because you need to explicitly enable it now

05:48	<patspam>	dave11: that's cool, I can see the New Distro available notice in Update Manager but it tries to download from the web, whereas I have the CDrom already
05:48	<nhaines>	Guest46686: Everyone is having trouble because the servers are being hammered.
05:48	<NAiL>	Guest46686: repos are a bit busy

05:50	<kindofabuzz>	sigh i guess i'm gonna have to drag this box closer to the router so i can use ethernet just to get wireless working in 8.04
05:50	<tricaric>	Hi all. I've completed an update to 8.04. Now I'm trying to do apt-get update and apt-get upgrade, but I get the following error:
05:50	<pawbie>	amirman84: compiz-fusion.org
05:50	<dave11>	patspam: the servers are overloaded, wait a day or so
05:50	<XceII>	compiz config settings mngr
05:50	<patspam>	the doc says run "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" but that doesn't work
05:50	<Kurtis->	kindofabuzz: What broadcom chip are you running?
05:50	<tricaric>	wait...
05:50	<Pokit>	I installed compiz fusion and now I cant get window borders from downloaded GTK2 themes to work right. any way to fix?
05:50	<kindofabuzz>	Kurtis-: bc4318
05:50	<pipegeek>	failed because nvidia-glx-new conflicted with xserver-xorg-core
05:50	<pipegeek>	interesting
05:50	<pawbie>	Pokit: Make sure decorators plugin is on?
05:50	<Kurtis->	ah, not the one I have
05:51	<nhaines>	patspam: yes, run gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"
05:51	<pipegeek>	welp, I've taken nvidia-glx-new off the blacklist, and I'll pick up the pieces when I'm done.
05:51	<Gnodab1>	Hi, I'm new to ubuntu, and need help blacklisting my onboard sound drivers
05:51	<harriseldon>	blueeyesmike it looks like it may be somewhere in the script. can you run the script manually in a shell with sudo? if that doesn't work, try exiting your gui session and doing it from a terminal session ctrl-alt-f1 and see if that works. from looking at my script it does a lot of checking for active x sessions
05:51	<Pokit>	pawbie, "window decoration" is enabled in compiz config
05:51	<patspam>	nhaines: sorry mate as I've said a couple of times, /cdrom/cdromupgrade doesn't exist
05:51	<pipegeek>	Gnodab1: can I be of assistance?
05:51	<Gnodab1>	sure
05:51	<Gnodab1>	:)
05:51	<pipegeek>	Looks like I'm going to be up for a while anyway ;)
05:51	<johd>	Anyone have problems with ububtu 8.04 and hibernate
05:51	<cob>	Gnodab1: the blacklist is in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
05:52	<nhaines>	patspam: Find out where you CD is.  It might be in /media/cdrom
05:52	<jeffimperial>	Flannel, harriseldon, nhaines, i found that the right syntax was sudo mount debianetch.iso /media/isoimage/ -t iso9660 -o loop thanks for your help
05:52	<pipegeek>	Gnodab1: indeed it is
05:52	<AdrianStrays>	I installed envy to fix hardy's issues with my graphics card, now movies don't display. Can anyone help me?
05:52	<Kurtis->	Anyone know how to get Broadcom bcm4311 rev 2 working in kernel 2.6.24? http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43#supported says it needs patches for this kernel
05:52	<Kurtis->	I'm not sure what sort of patches
05:53	<blueeyesmike>	harriseldon just tried that with and without sudo and neither does anything, It just returns to prompt
05:53	<zero88>	Ok. Is there a way I can record music that is being played through a web browser somehow?
05:53	<Pokit>	in compiz fusion when i apply a custom GTK2 theme, my window borders still look like "clearlooks" except only the hue changes
05:53	<pawbie>	zero88: Audacity
05:53	<LainIwakura>	cob: Thanks: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64308/
05:53	<johd>	zero audacity
05:53	<MrObvious>	!ndiswrapper
05:53	<MeatGrinder>	So why use alternate CD instead of just doing internet upgrade?
05:53	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
05:53	<patspam>	nhaines: it's in /media/cdrom0, but again /media/cdrom0/cdromupgrade doesn't exist
05:53	<zero88>	pawbie, what does that do exactly?
05:53	<loufoque>	Pokit: window borders are independent from the gtk theme
05:53	<Kurtis->	I've tried ndiswrapper
05:53	<pawbie>	zero88: records from the mixer.
05:53	<MrObvious>	Did someone forget to package ndiswrapper utils with Hardy?
05:53	<Pokit>	loufoque, is it possible to use GTK2 themes with compiz fusion?
05:53	<Kurtis->	no, it's there
05:53	<rich_freecomm>	Anyone here have Konversation?
05:53	<Kurtis->	in repositories, at least
05:53	<nhaines>	MeatGrinder: because the alternate CD can be downloaded via BitTorrent and the official repositories are really, really being hammered right now.
05:53	<Flannel>	MeatGrinder: you download as a torrent, instead of from the mirrors (which are especially slow right now)
05:54	<loufoque>	Pokit: sure
05:54	<nhaines>	patspam: Are you sure you're using the alternate install CD and not the desktop CD?
05:54	<MrObvious>	I'm trying to make my BCM94311 work and need ndiswrapper since the b43 drivers won't install here.
05:54	<pawbie>	nhaines: All of the CDs are available by torrent.
05:54	<Kurtis->	MrObvious same chip as I
05:54	<patspam>	nhaines: bugger i think i have the desktop cd
05:54	<nhaines>	pawbie: He was only talking about the alternate install CD.
05:54	<dave11>	rich_freecomm: #kubuntu
05:54	<Kurtis->	tried ndiswrapper myself, and it didn't work
05:54	<nhaines>	patspam: A common mistake.  I run into it myself occasionally.
05:54	<patspam>	nhaines: download wasted? or possible to still use?
05:54	<MeatGrinder>	i hate torrents, so damn slow and the seeding part I don't like so much. Aren't torrents just for transmitting viruses and trojans?
05:54	<Kurtis->	Of course, is there any way to disable the native drivers?
05:54	<loufoque>	Pokit: System >	Preferences >	Apparence
05:55	<Kurtis->	Torrents aren't slow
05:55	<zero88>	pawbie, i see thanks
05:55	<Utalcn2me>	Pokit, go into your settings  manager to change your window borders
05:55	<Toran>	OK, I was in the middle of updating with update-manager and I had to cancel it (it was in the "downloading packages" stage). What should I do to continue the upgrade?
05:55	<Starnestommy>	MeatGrinder: they're also for sharing large files
05:55	<AdrianStrays>	I used Envy to install a ATI Driver, and now videos in Totem, VLC, etc don't display.  Can anyone help me?
05:55	<harriseldon>	blueeyesmike did you check for bugs about this? It seems like some check is failing in the script
05:55	<IcemanV9>	patspam: dl alternative cd torrent then. it's fast. you can use desktop for later.
05:55	<pawbie>	MeatGrinder: If you're serious, I'm going to headdesk.
05:55	<osmosis>	what is 'enable watching' do for tracker ?
05:55	<Starnestommy>	AdrianStrays: you probablt messed up more things by using envy
05:55	<nhaines>	patspam: Lend it to friends!  :D
05:55	<loufoque>	Kurtis-: they are if you can't upload because of a router, like 80% of the people
05:55	<Starnestommy>	*probably
05:55	<harriseldon>	AdrianStrays did you use envy or envyng
05:55	<nhaines>	patspam: But yeah, unfortunately you can't upgrade with the Desktop CD.
05:55	<Pokit>	loufoque, I guess i just dont understand how it works. when I download a GTK2 theme from the web, and drag it into the theme window and apply the theme, it doesnt "really" change.  the theme stays as clearlooks but the hue of the window border changes..
05:55	<MeatGrinder>	any recommendations for a torrent client? I have getright and it supposedly works with torrents but never tried it
=== ka2u is now known as ka2zzzz
05:55	<Kurtis->	loufoque: That's why you enable port forwarding

05:55	<schnootop>	hello i am trying to upgrade distro but when it is trying to get the new channels it keeps on stoppin and having to retry and fetch it because its failing to connect to all the en_AU i18n files

05:56	<AdrianStrays>	stamestommy, yep. Last time I listen help from people on the forums....
05:56	<harriseldon>	AdrianStrays please goto http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html envyng should be use with hardy
05:56	<jlund>	Any idea how to get Nvidia driver to work? It says it is installed by not active in the Hardware manager.
05:56	<blueeyesmike>	i've been looking just now best I could find was this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/188194 but when I do that log I don't get any button press events from gnome-power-manager like this guy did
05:57	<pawbie>	AdrianStrays: Envy is one of those great things that...  when it works, it works great.  When it fails, it epic fails.  Sounds like you just have a slight fail at the moment, though.
=== client is now known as eun_chae
05:57	<pipegeek>	Okay, I'm confused by this.  The upgrade is failing because it would have to remove nvidia-glx-new, but xserver-xorg-core conflicts with nvidia-glx-new

05:57	<nhaines>	patspam: My pleasure.  Torrents are a way to download from many people who are downloading a file.  It is popular for large files because it means that bandwidth is shared between downloaders.  Consider leaving your BitTorrent client running afterwards, to help out others who still need Ubuntu!
05:58	<harriseldon>	pipegeek did you have envy installed? If so, did you follow the directions to completely remove it?
05:58	<schnootop>	anyone have any idea why that might be ?
05:58	<Irreducibilis>	Will the channel explode if too many people are in it?
05:58	<^V^>	Hi, the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 didn't work correctly for me. The boot menu didn't get updated and when I tried booting into the old kernel version I obviously had issues with modules..(nvidia)
05:58	<pawbie>	Irreducibilis:  Yes.
05:58	<AdrianStrays>	harriseldon, oh wait, I miss read what you wrote.  I did use EnvyNG.

05:58	<CyberCod>	Irreducibilis: doubtful, but with too many people it is hard for anyone to get helped because the stuff scrolls by so darn fast
05:58	<Kurtis->	Though BitTorrent 6 is just the same as uTorrent now
05:58	<KyleK>	yea utorrent is <3

06:04	<Toran>	I was in the middle of upgrading to hardy with update-manager and I had to cancel it (it was in the "downloading packages" stage). What should I do to continue the upgrade?
06:04	<bbyever>	jtmonz: so i should download again?
06:04	<KyleK>	maap_rj: everyones messing with 8.04 today
06:04	<pawbie>	Toran: restart the update manager
06:04	<devin_>	last two releases weren't LTS
06:04	<nhaines>	pawbie: It was pretty close.  A day or two and it'll clear back up again.  It takes a week or so before it really gets better.
06:04	<amirman84>	pawbie: i'm specifically looking for alternatives to using just grub
06:04	<pawbie>	devin_: Zactly.  Nor did they feature wubi and the new AD thingie.
06:05	<jtmonz>	bbyever: i would just switch servers... it was easy to do in synaptic
06:05	<Sciri>	McHearty: Which page? On the Web site? I can poke someone about it.
06:05	<gogeta>	amirman84 floppy disk supergrub cd
06:05	<McHearty>	Hang on I'll link you
06:05	<MeatGrinder>	oh joy, i have 5.4k download on the alternate torrent...only 27 more hours to go!
06:05	<therealnanotube>	pawbie: ehrm... the slashdot effect happens every day. :)  though probably it's mostly bandwidth saturation rather than server pounding per se.
06:05	<McHearty>	Sciri: http://www.ubuntu.com/support/communitysupport
06:05	<pawbie>	amirman84:  Why?
06:05	<Schypher_>	air/join #wpa_supplicant
06:05	<Toran>	pawbie: it doesn't recognize that there is a new version of ubuntu out, now. It just has a huge list of packages to upgrade as if I weren't doing a dist upgrade
06:05	<XceII>	only 27?
06:05	<Sciri>	McHearty: ta, I'll poke newz tomorrow morning.
06:05	<maccam94>	is it possible to do a "clean" install of ubuntu without formatting? (leaving /home the way it is, and no i don't want to go into making a separate home)
06:05	<bbyever>	what do you mean just switch servers...
06:06	<pawbie>	maccam94: Ya.  Make a new partition, cp -r /home to the new partition, and mount the new partition as your /home during install.
06:06	<gogeta>	maccam94 yep if you have a /home partation
06:06	<therealnanotube>	maccam94: back up /home to external drive, make clean install, move /home back.
06:06	<gogeta>	maccam94 just format /
06:06	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, still doesn't work....
06:06	<Kurtis->	amirman84: Which are you trying to dual-boot?
06:06	<nhaines>	maccam94: Not without making a seperate /home partition.
06:06	<KyleK>	maccam94: boot the live cd and delete everything thats not /home, and then partition manually
06:06	<amirman84>	pawbie, gogeta: i wonder if i can use the windows bootloader to point to grub on my linux partition instead of having to overwrite the mbr with grub
06:06	<Kurtis->	XP or Vista?
06:06	<KyleK>	maccam94: then dont click format
06:06	<McHearty>	ta-ta
06:06	<IcemanV9>	MeatGrinder: it'll speed up soon
06:06	<gogeta>	amirman84 kinda
06:06	<jtmonz>	.mx == mexico? just use another north american server... go in to synaptic or adept manager and change the default server from there
06:06	<pawbie>	amirman84: Have a look at how Wubi uses grub4dos to do that.
06:06	<Kurtis->	amirman84: You can, but it requires some third party tools
06:06	<amirman84>	kurtis: xp media center
06:06	<Fishscene>	Windows bootloaders only recognize Windows OS's
06:06	<ripps>	AdrianStrays: can you post your xorg.conf?
=== tanner is now known as xerroz
06:06	<MeatGrinder>	IcemanV9, ok thanks
06:06	<Kurtis->	Debian has an article how to use ntldr with bootpart
06:07	<fysa>	if you have an old version..  you can try to use rsync to update it based on differences.
06:07	<cob>	Fishscene: not true...I've booted linux from Windows' bootloader
06:07	<jim_beam>	is there a keep connection alive program
06:07	<cob>	due to a corporate requirement
06:07	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I forgot the command to display it.
06:07	<jtmonz>	yeah, it's called wubi
06:07	<Kurtis->	amirman84: http://www.aboutdebian.com/dualboot.htm
06:07	<Fishscene>	cob, seriously? Do you have an article I could follow?
06:07	<rkvirani>	hey all
06:07	<gogeta>	thers a way to boot it one ext3 to
06:07	<nhaines>	hey, rkvirani.
06:07	<rkvirani>	just downloaded the latest and installed it
06:07	<jtmonz>	Fishscene: install it with wubi
06:07	<gogeta>	using windows boot
06:07	<LainIwakura>	Can someone help me with my Internet connection? I can't get it to work, but it worked in Gutsy. I have a broadcom 4311 and the wiki page isn't helpful.
06:07	<pipegeek>	Ah.  Was using mirrors.kernel.org, which is a week behind.
06:07	<IcemanV9>	MeatGrinder: it usually starts slowly, then speed up quickly
06:07	<rkvirani>	downloaded the nvidia driver and the shadow for compiz is PINK!
06:07	<Fishscene>	jtmonz, that's cheating :|
06:07	<gogeta>	been a long time sence i tryed
=== dulkemith is now known as nirwana
06:07	<jtmonz>	(i think it's the last option when you boot the cd)
06:08	<rkvirani>	any ideas?
06:08	<KyleK>	rkvirani: we're not a forum, we dont really need introductions ;)
06:08	<bbyever>	jtmonz: but how would that make a difference? i checked de md5sum and it was correct...
06:08	<harriseldon>	amirman84 you can change the boot.ini to boot into grub -- I have done it before with lilo many eons ago
06:08	<amirman84>	what are the config files for wubi's bootloader called?
06:08	<devin_>	minus the fact that 8.04 server released also don't help speed things up any
06:08	<pawbie>	Lots of bcm43xx issues tonight.
06:08	<cob>	Fishscene: would be happy to google it up but currently waiting on ff to download java jre and with the apt repos all tied up with 8.04 install activity it's ttaking forever
06:08	<rkvirani>	KyleK: pardon me?
06:08	<KyleK>	rkvirani: what'd you break?
06:08	<harriseldon>	amirman84 I will search online and let you know
06:08	<cob>	pawbie: 8.04 release fudged broadcom up worse than beta
06:08	<jtmonz>	Fishscene: ohh, you want a separate partition
06:08	<rkvirani>	rkvirani: nothing...
06:08	<KyleK>	ah
06:08	<amirman84>	harriseldon: that's what i'm wanting to do, i think.
06:08	<LainIwakura>	I'm having trouble with broadcom yes
06:08	<maccam94>	KyleK: have you personally done it? as i remember in 7.10 it wouldn't let you proceed without formatting /
06:08	<ripps>	AdrianStays: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
06:08	<rkvirani>	just installed the NVIDIA driver.
06:08	<crdlb>	rkvirani: that's a well-known nvidia driver bug:/
06:08	<MeatGrinder>	IcemanV9, does it matter which client I use? I'm using getright right now.
06:08	<Fishscene>	cob, no problem. I have to go now anyway, but I'll see if I can look into it anyway. Thanks for the heads up though. I hate giving out false info.
06:08	<jtmonz>	bbyever: i couldn't get my 8.04 cd to mount for some reason... so i just swithced servers... do whatever you feel like though
06:08	<pawbie>	cob: Ya?  Crap.  I have a friend that's downloading 8.04 in hopes of getting his bcm43xx up and running.
06:08	<rkvirani>	crdlb: what can be done?
06:08	<LainIwakura>	cob, did you get my pastebin?
06:08	<Maxdamantus>	I'm installing 8.04 onto a virtual machine in VMWare, using XFS as the root partition. The installer stopped at 94% (it warned me GRUB has problems with XFS), so I closed it, installed GRUB myself (from the `grub` prompt), and was able to boot to the GRUB command line. However, the installer hadn't got to making my grub.conf yet. Could someone pastebin theirs for me (I'll figure out what to edit)
06:08	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, no I know paste bin, I forgot how to bring xorg.conf up
06:08	<james_>	hi
06:09	<rkvirani>	it worked fine prior to 8.04 release
06:09	<crdlb>	rkvirani: you could turn off the shadows entirely I guess
06:09	<KyleK>	maccam94: thats odd, well you could debootstrap maybe
06:09	<IcemanV9>	MeatGrinder: it shouldn't matter
06:09	<rkvirani>	crdlb: alright
06:09	<rkvirani>	thanks
06:09	<cob>	Lainlwakura: no can you paste url again please?
06:09	<LainIwakura>	cob: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64308/
06:09	<LainIwakura>	Thanks
06:09	<derenrich>	I'm having a problem where compiz fails to load properly (but direct rendering is enabled)  and I have to fall back on metacity. Anyone else noticing this problem?
06:09	<cob>	ok Lain  be a min...still waiting on this plugin install
06:09	<mattycoze>	hey does anyone know whether the Envy works in Ubuntu 8.04
06:09	<ripps>	AdrianStarys: From terminal ->	gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
06:09	<LainIwakura>	cob: Okay, thanks.
06:10	<pawbie>	derenrich: XGL/AIGLX available?
06:10	<LoLeN>	does sb have a torrent link for ubuntu x386 desktop edition (DVD) ?
06:10	<ceil420>	why does Hardy include emacs? vim is clearly superior...
06:10	<crdlb>	derenrich: what video card?
06:10	<pawbie>	derenrich:  run "compiz --replace" from terminal and see if you get errors.
06:10	<LoLeN>	i cant get into the ubuntu website
06:10	<derenrich>	nvidia
06:10	<harriseldon>	amirman84 http://www.geocities.com/epark/linux/grub-w2k-HOWTO.html It looks like a pretty good guide, but make sure to have backups of boot.ini and an xp disk handy to repair master boot record if you make a mistake
06:10	<therealnanotube>	how's multi-monitor support on hardy? nice and easy to set up, or still requires fiddling a lot with xorg.conf?
06:10	<pawbie>	LoLeN: http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/
06:10	<derenrich>	pawbie: I get warnigns
06:10]  * BACphist rocks
06:10	<drivetrax>	apt-get is not getting
06:10	<bbyever>	jtmonz: its just mine does mount, but when i select any option from the menu it gives me the error

06:10	<james_>	I just upgraded to 8.04 and want to install my video capture cards
06:10	<pawbie>	derenrich: ....do they say anything useful?
06:10	<amirman84>	mattycoze: from what i've heard you need a specific version of envy called envyNG for 8.04
06:10	<jim_beam>	can u upgrade from 7.1 to hardy with dvd
06:10	<drivetrax>	there we go
06:10	<jtmonz>	bbyever: probably a bad burn then
06:10	<BACphist>	:P
06:10	<derenrich>	pawbie: not useful to me, things like "/usr/bin/compiz.real (core) - Warn: No GLXFBConfig for depth 32"
06:10	<Geoffrey2>	now, can I upgrade to Heron with a burned CD as the source?
06:10	<mattycoze>	amirman84 is that in Synaptic?
06:11	<amirman84>	harriseldon: thank you very much
06:11	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64309/
06:11	<pawbie>	derenrich:  That's useful.  You have no GLXFBConfig for depth 32.  Go add it.
06:11	<ceil420>	and why isn't an upgrade for libconfuse included? ><
06:11]  * BACphist thinks that Hardy is gonna steal the 75% percent of market share windows has after there 25% drop
06:11	<bbyever>	jtmonz: ok, ill try burning again
06:11	<ceil420>	i better be able to update that on my own after this...
06:11	<sigma_1234>	is it dangerous to install gutsy packages in hardy?
06:11	<pawbie>	BACphist: Wishful thinking. :\
06:11	<bbyever>	jtmonz: thanks
06:11	<BACphist>	NAY!!!!
06:11	<LoLeN>	isnt there the dvd version?
06:11	<crdlb>	derenrich: please join #compiz-fusion to be factoided
06:11	<BACphist>	Well, maybe some will be mac
06:12	<pawbie>	BACphist: I'd just be happy when Apple dies completely.
06:12	<meeper>	BACphist: would you really want hardy to have 75%?
06:12	<meeper>	pawbie++
06:12	<schnootop>	anyone having any problems with upgrading and localisation files ? It seems to be choking on trying to fetch en_AU files ?
06:12	<BACphist>	But, windoze sales dropped 25 %
06:12	<harriseldon>	sigma_1234 depends on the package, but it is generally not a good idea
06:12	<drivetrax>	crdlb:  You know this!
06:12	<meeper>	pawbie: Apple is evil and scales me much more than Windows
06:12	<jtmonz>	bbyever: no problem
06:12	<BACphist>	They lost 25% market over too mac linux berkely unix etc
06:12	<amirman84>	mattycoze: i downloaded it off of their website but it didn't work for me but that was because i was using the older version of wubi for 8.04 that never finished the install. have you tried allowing backports and proposed packages in software sources?
06:12	<pawbie>	meeper: Agree.  Google is getting there.....
06:12	<jtmonz>	BACphist: i read 11%
06:12	<jtmonz>	earnings were 11% short, right?

06:12	<ceil420>	BACphist, i think people are just sticking with XP and not buying Vista
06:13	<BACphist>	Yea,
06:13	<mattycoze>	amirman84 no i haven't
06:13	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, any luck?
06:13	<BACphist>	Never thought the day would come where i'd agree with that statement lol
06:13	<ceil420>	i know a lot of people that are holding out til Windows 7; if that fails as much as Vista apparently has, many will make the switch to alternative OSes
06:13	<pawbie>	ceil420: To quote the balmers....  "They're missing out on a lot of VALUE!"
06:13	<Kurtis->	I don't see MS losing a good deal of marketshare anytime soon.
06:13	<bcgrown>	I am using the nvidia-glx-new driver with a Geforce fx 5500 and on my tv-out it only shows the top left corner of my screen (1024x768,  tv is supposed to be at 640x480).  how do i show the whole screen on my TV?  I have overscan set to zero
06:13	<ceil420>	pawbie, riiight :p
06:13	<mattycoze>	amirman84 what's the software repository i have to add in synaptic?
06:13	<mgmz>	any ubuntu program where i can input infrared from TV remote control and convert them to sound (*.mp3, *.wav, *.avi...etc)?
06:13	<pawbie>	ceil420: Seriously...  he says that....  weird dude.
06:13	<KyleK>	vistas not that bad, its the same amount of hassle with ubuntu
06:14	<eugenebythesea>	=0
06:14	<Kurtis->	Vista doesn't suck, though. Not sure why everyone hates it so much, really.
06:14	<schnootop>	anyone have any idea ?
06:14	<sigma_1234>	i want to install apache mysql and php and postgresql and really dont want to re download them. also i use a gutsy version of quasar accounting. will that run in hardy?
06:14	<jtmonz>	bcgrown: i believe there is a program called nvidia-settings that should be installed already... try using that
06:14	<pawbie>	Kurtis-: I <3 Vista and Debian.
06:14	<ceil420>	pawbie, Ballmer's gotta be one of the most psychotic large-company CEOs of all time
06:14	<pawbie>	Ubuntu is pissering me off...  :\

06:14	<ubotu>	KyleK pawalls ceil420: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
06:14	<Kurtis->	I'm using Vista right now.
06:14	<bittin>	;-(
06:14	<bcgrown>	jtmonz: i've been there, there's nothing to adjust that makes it work
06:14	<j_humphrey>	Does anyone know how to force the ipw3945 driver to be used in hardy?
06:14	<talcite>	hey nickrud, are there any issues with resizing the /boot partition I should be aware of?
06:14	<mattycoze>	amirman84 or is it already in the list
06:14	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, my computer would choke on Vista. also, it's ugly. and that's the last of MS that i'll talk about, lest someone kicks me <_<
06:14	<BACphist>	Kurtis:  Vista is gay, like tetris, and you. Be a real man download a UNNIX like solaris or BSD
06:14	<talcite>	Hardy complains my boot partition is too small
06:14	<BACphist>	Sissys.
06:14	<jtmonz>	bcgrown: hmm, sorry... ati here :(
06:15	<nickrud>	talcite get rid of it, just keep your kernels in the /boot on the root partition ;)
06:15	<pawbie>	bacphist: Server 2008 core ftw.
06:15	<Radiobuzz>	Hi all, I'm having a problem: I've upgraded to Hardy and apparently everything went well, the problem was that I answered "no" when the installation asked me if it should update grub list automaticly... Now I have the same old list with Ubuntu 7.10 and kernel 2.6.22-14. When I run "update-grub" I think it sees the new kernel (which I assume is 2.6.24-16) and says "updating list... done" but in reality it doesn't modify the list. Could anyone help me?
06:15	<talcite>	nickrud: oh =S. Err how should I do that?
06:15	<nickrud>	talcite but resizing issues? None that I can think of :)
06:15	<bullgard4>	mc shows an entry prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). I found that this means a "stale symlink". What is a 'stale symlink'?
06:15	<mattycoze>	amirman84 (i'm currently trying to download it from the software backports from synaptic; just letting it refresh the list; which is taking an unbelievably long time; perhaps becausethe server is being nuked atm)
06:15	<unop>	j_humphrey, if 'sudo modprobe -v ipw3945' loads the module and your device works find and you are happy, add ipw3945 to your /etc/modules list and reboot
06:15	<Kurtis->	Psh, anyone who results to insulting obviously doesn't know any actual reasons to dislike it other than it's trendy.
06:15	<amirman84>	mattycoze: i would STRONGLY recommend going into SYSTEM >	ADMINISTRATION >	SOFTWARE SOURCES and enabling "proprietary drivers for devices (restricted)" , "software restricted by copyright and legal issues (multiverse)" under the Ubuntu software tab
06:15	<pawbie>	Radiobuzz: After you update, I believe you still have to install again.
06:15	<schnootop>	by looking in http://au.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy/restricted/i18n/ only en files there are is en_GB is it possible to change it over to this and just use GB locale files ?
06:15	<nickrud>	talcite you could unmount boot , then run sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-$(uname -r) grub
06:15	<ceil420>	bah i still have qt crap installed ><
06:15	<unop>	s/find/fine/
06:15	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: Copy http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64310/ and replace xorg.conf ->	"sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf/"
06:15	<talcite>	nickrud: ahh ok good. would I need to reboot onto a liveCD? or is unmounting the partition good enough?
06:15	<pawbie>	Radiobuzz: I'm probably wrong, though.  wait for a second opinion.
06:16	<Kurtis->	At least I can get wireless drivers to work in Vista.
06:16	<jeffimperia1>	Newbie help here again, pls.. Just mounted the alternate ISO for hardy.. now, which do i execute? the cdromupgrade md5?
06:16	<insub>	Hi all
06:16	<talcite>	oh...
06:16	<MrObvious>	How come my wireless only connects at a 2Mbps using WPA and being right next to the router?
06:16	<Radiobuzz>	pawbie, you mean to reinstall Hardy?
06:16	<bittin>	hi
06:16	<CyberCod>	is there some reason why the Wubi installer keeps trying to download a new ISO even though I'm running it off an 8.04 disk?
06:16	<mattycoze>	amirman84 why so strongly recommended?
06:16	<mattycoze>	most people do anyway amirman84
06:16	<talcite>	nickrud: for resizing I mean. I think I'll move to /boot next clean install
06:16	<pawbie>	Radiobuzz: NO!@#  Hah..   Reinstall grub.
06:16	<amirman84>	mattycoze: also allow third party software and proposed and backports under the updates tab
06:16	<insub>	Is there an office torrent for the new ubutnu release ?
06:16	<j_humphrey>	unop, i tried modprobe ipw3945, but it says module does not exist
06:16	<pawbie>	insub: http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/
06:16	<insub>	offical**
06:16	<KyleK>	MrObvious: literally next to? if so thats the problem
06:16	<nickrud>	talcite no reason you couldn't resize it
06:16	<ceil420>	no update for e16 either :x
06:16	<talcite>	nickrud: great. Thanks
06:16	<insub>	thanks pawbie
06:16	<unop>	j_humphrey, you probably need to get the source for it and install it
06:16	<Radiobuzz>	pawbie, oh, LOL, ok thanks. I'll still wait to see if anyone has another idea though :)
06:17	<j_humphrey>	unop, will i have to recompile the kernel?
06:17	<pawbie>	radiobuzz: Ya ;)
06:17	<insub>	trying to download it from a server was dreadful lol
06:17	<pawbie>	MrObvious: Wiki "omnidirectional antenna"
06:17	<unop>	j_humphrey, not if you compile the driver as a module -- then you just modprobe it
06:17	<^V^>	My menu.lst is updated but the boot menu isn't using it, how do I update it?
06:17	<j_humphrey>	unop, how do i compile it as a module?
06:17	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, done
06:17	<Shadow_X>	how do i upgrade from the alternate cd?
06:17	<amirman84>	mattycoze: because i've spent weeks trying to get my wireless and graphics card to be supported in ubuntu, going through all the hassle of combing the forums and messing with code i had no idea about in the terminal when i didn't need to, when i allowed those software sources the drivers came in automatically and installed painlessly only requiring one reboot
06:18	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: Now reboot
06:18	<mattycoze>	amirman84: oh
06:18	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, brb
06:18	<unop>	j_humphrey, the source for the driver will have instructions -- the procedure for each driver can be different
06:18	<node357>	the installer I have says it's pre-release.. did I grab the wrong ISO ?
06:18	<j_humphrey>	thanks unop
06:18	<nickrud>	^V^ grub should use that new menu.lst automatically, unless you aren't editing the right one? You have more than one linux install on the system?
06:18	<cob>	omg ok, everyone off the apt repos for a minute...I need to finish this jre install
06:18	<FastZ>	^V^: did you reboot?
06:18	<tawt>	what's the difference between desktop and server versions?
06:18	<pawbie>	^v^: grub-install
06:18	<pawbie>	tawt: The installer....
06:19	<Kurtis->	How would I blacklist the b43 driver from loading for my Broadcom chip? I want to use ndiswrapper
06:19	<talcite>	tawt: the server versions don't have X11 by default
06:19	<Y-Town>	Do the Europe and German mirrors to download 8.04 have english version or are they in other languages by default?
06:19	<samliu>	server doesnt install a gui by default
06:19	<^V^>	nickrud: That's the state that my upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 left the system in
06:19	<cob>	Kurtis-: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
06:19	<FastZ>	tawt: pawbie: the kernel
06:19	<unop>	tawt, the server versions don't have GUI environments, and come with the LAMP packages by default
06:19	<Kurtis->	well, yeah, I know about that
06:19	<talcite>	tawt: If you aren't clear on the differences, I'd say desktop is the one you want =D
06:19	<Kurtis->	but would I just list "b43"?
06:19	<mattycoze>	amirman84 are you in aus? the sudo apt-get update process lags heaps on au.archive.ubuntu.com
06:19	<Sciri>	tawt: Desktop has a GUI for home/office/notebook users. Server has no GUI for, well, servers like Web and database. ;)
06:19	<tawt>	lol  yeah.  just curious
06:19	<Kurtis->	cob: would I just type b43 in there?
06:19	<nickrud>	^V^ put your menu.list on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org just for fun
06:19	<FastZ>	unop: Ubuntu server comes with LAMP packages by default now?
06:19	<pawbie>	fastz: Ya?  I figured server precompiles were the same as desktop kernels.
06:19	<jeffimperia1>	Just mounted the alternate ISO for hardy.. now, which do i execute? the cdromupgrade md5?
06:19	<talcite>	ahh. server edition's pretty fun. I threw it onto an old machine to play around with
06:19	<samliu>	Kurtis, what kind of card do you have
06:20	<talcite>	its interesting
06:20	<unop>	FastZ, yep
06:20	<cob>	Kurtis-: whatever is loaded up, check lsmod, I would say be sure b43-legacy or anything else with b43 in the name is blacklisted
06:20	<amirman84>	mattycoze: no i'm in the US
06:20	<Kurtis->	bcm4311 rev 2
06:20	<KyleK>	Kurtis-: blacklisting or the other one?
06:20	<mattycoze>	oh ok
06:20	<KyleK>	cos the syntax in /blacklist is blacklist b43
06:20	<gogeta>	unop: ubuntu has roaches lol lots of bugs
06:20	<mattycoze>	amirman84 reckon it'll be right if i change the server?
06:20	<drivetrax>	Gutsy Ubuntu SE..satanic edition..lol
06:20	<bcgrown>	(10:13:37 PM) bcgrown: I am using the nvidia-glx-new driver with a Geforce fx 5500 and on my tv-out it only shows the top left corner of my screen (1024x768,  tv is supposed to be at 640x480).  how do i show the whole screen on my TV?
06:20	<gogeta>	:P
06:20	<iusegnulinux>	hi all, just booted into 8.04 :)
06:20]  * nickrud gets tired of telling people not to modify blacklist, but create a new one to edit
06:20	<LainIwakura>	Kurtis- I have a bcm4311 too. Should I blacklist b43 and use ndiswrapper?
06:20	<FastZ>	pawbie: nah, the server kernel has is hardened a little and has some other stuff... i'm not 100% up to speed on the differences, but i know there are some slight inequalities between the two versions
06:20	<unop>	gogeta, i can't say i am surprised :) it's well, expected
06:20	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: I have no idea
06:20	<samliu>	yeah blacklist b43
06:21	<Cpudan80>	Hello all
=== j_humphrey_ is now known as j_humphrey
06:21	<samliu>	you have ndiswrapper set up?
06:21	<Cpudan80>	I've got a wierd problem
06:21	<Radiobuzz>	I'll try to add it manually to the list, we'll meet again if something goes wrong. Thanks pawbie!
06:21	<amirman84>	you shouldn't need to use terminal commands at all. just allow those sources and update through the GUI
06:21	<Kurtis->	I don't even see b43 listed in here
06:21	<ceil420>	iusegnulinux, i have "About 16 hours 6 minutes remaining" to install Hardy <_<
06:21	<Y-Town>	Do the Europe and German mirrors to download 8.04 have english version or are they in other languages by default?
06:21	<Cpudan80>	So I just upgraded to hardy --- but now the number pad (on the keyboard) wont work
06:21	<talcite>	uhh... sorry why is everyone here saying blacklist b43?
06:21	<LainIwakura>	not sure how to blacklist it or setup ndiswrapper
06:21	<samliu>	no you have to add it
06:21	<FastZ>	unop: when did LAMP become standard package install?  with 7.10 it wasnt default I dont think...or was it?  i did a dist-upgrade for that version
06:21	<pawbie>	Radiobuzz: grub-install shouldn't be damaging if you want to try it.  G'luck.
06:21	<cob>	Kurtis-: ssb?
06:21	<ceil420>	(finally got dist-upgrade to work)
06:21	<nickrud>	Y-Town the cd's are all the same
06:21	<pawbie>	pft, AMP?  Like anyone uses that....
06:21	<Cpudan80>	It's a laptop connected to a docking cradle...
06:21	<drivetrax>	num-lock on?
06:21	<^V^>	nickrud: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64311/
06:21	<talcite>	as of the 2 6 24 kernel, b43 should be the one to use. Ndiswrapper is pretty terrible. bcm43xx is even worse
06:21	<Y-Town>	nickkewl, the mirrors are faster  :o)
06:21	<ceil420>	FastZ, when did emacs become a standard package install? i don't even want the program ;x
06:22	<cob>	Lainlwakura: not sure you want to go that route yet...unless you really want to
06:22	<Kurtis->	cob: yes, ssb
06:22	<LainIwakura>	talcite: How can I get b43 to work?
06:22	<KyleK>	i wish b43 worked for me :)
06:22	<^V^>	nickrud: it looks okay but it just isn't being used
06:22	<Schypher_>	any expert on ndiswrapper?
06:22	<nickrud>	^V^ and what do you see when you boot?
06:22	<talcite>	LainIwakura: what kernel version are you running? uname-r
06:22	<talcite>	uname -r*
06:22	<samliu>	gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
06:22	<^V^>	the old menu with 7.10
06:22	<samliu>	add the line *blacklist b43*
06:22	<samliu>	save and close
06:22	<Cpudan80>	Nevermind
06:22	<FastZ>	ceil420: huh? who said anything about emacs?
06:22	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: i used to use ndiswrapper for 7.10, and am now on 8.04 - should i use b43 then?
06:22	<Cpudan80>	Google is my friend :-)
06:22	<samliu>	use ndiswrapper
06:22	<nhaines>	talcite: Use a wired connection System >	Administration >	Hardware Drivers
06:22	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, well I have video now, but it blinks in and out and has lines all over the place
06:22	<nhaines>	talcite: But remove ndiswrapper first.
06:22	<nickrud>	^V^ show me the contents of /etc/fstab
06:23	<samliu>	if ndiswrapper worked before, I wouldn't stop using it
06:23	<amirman84>	How do i mute the PC speaker beeps on Ubuntu?
06:23	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: depends on your card. Ndiswrapper is good if you happen to be using the MN-720
06:23	<pawbie>	amirman84: Take the pcspeaker out.
06:23	<nickrud>	^V^ and the output of sudo fdisk -l
06:23	<ceil420>	FastZ, i looked through the list of modified/installed programs that i'm getting with my dist-upgrade to Hardy. "Install emacs22" was among the changes
06:23	<Kurtis->	ndiswrapper hasn't worked for me, but ssb has been running
06:23	<samliu>	thats what happened to my card when I upgraded from feisty to gutsy
06:23	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: Do you have Compiz enabled?
06:23	<unop>	FastZ, http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition
06:23	<user11>	!VMWARE
06:23	<ubotu>	VMWare Player is in Ubuntu's !Multiverse repository (package "vmware-player", not available for Gutsy, only Feisty and Edgy), and http://www.easyvmx.com/easyvmx.shtml can create VMs for it. Instructions can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware - See also !virtualizers
06:23	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: lspci -v. Tell us what chipset your wireless card is using
06:23	<amirman84>	pawbie: there's got to be a better way
06:23	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, yes.
06:23	<jeffimperia1>	i tried running the cdromupgrade md5 using terminal. the terminal comes up then disappears instantly.. what to do?
06:23	<ceil420>	FastZ, if you're asking why i mention it to you, it's because you also mentioned a new package in the install
06:23	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: i see. i'm on a bcm43-something card. not sure how to see the info on it?
06:23	<LoLeN>	when i reboot the pc i have to always type "modprobe ndiswrapper && depmod -a" to get my wireless to work, why is that??
06:23	<gogeta>	nickrud lol i cant even keep up
06:23	<pawbie>	amirman84: Probably, but I'm an efficiency guy myself...
06:23	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: lspci -v
06:24	<LainIwakura>	talcite: 2.6.24.-16-generic
06:24	<nickrud>	gogeta I don't try, I track a couple people at a time :)
06:24	<unop>	FastZ, i think it was fiesty when it was introducted, i can't be sure
06:24	<^V^>	nickrud: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64312/
06:24	<morphy>	brb.. checking the new install guide I found if it works
06:24	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: It's my experience that Compiz pushes your hardware too much, try disabling it.
06:24	<talcite>	LainIwakura: that's using the new wireless stack. You should be using b43 if possible
06:24	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: here it is - BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n
06:24	<FastZ>	ceil420: oh, i couldnt tell ya why some packages are installed by default.  unop said something about the server version being a LAMP server installation by default.
06:24	<mattycoze>	amirman84 i get this from planet mirror; Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead. (plus a whole load of "failed to fetch")
06:24	<pawbie>	LoLeN:  Check your restricted modules and see if it's set to load.
06:24	<talcite>	LainIwakura: what chipset is your wireless using?
06:24	<samliu>	hmm compiz only pushes your computer too much if you have a crappy gfx card...
06:24	<talcite>	LainIwakura: lspci -v
06:24	<Shadow_X>	anyone have problems upgrading today?
06:24	<pawbie>	samliu: And a pentium 133...
06:24	<Shadow_X>	other than the server being slow
06:24	<samliu>	lol
06:24	<samliu>	good point
06:25	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: oh... its one of those blasted draft-n cards...
06:25	<LoLeN>	pawbie: how do i check them?
06:25	<Kurtis->	I just tried blacklisting ssb and b43. I'll try ndiswrapper by itself now
06:25	<LainIwakura>	talcite: Okay. Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 01)
06:25	<Geoffrey2>	I downloaded the ISO for Hardy Heron and burned it to a CD...now, can that be used to upgrade Ubuntu Gutsy, or can I only do a full install with that...
06:25	<unop>	LoLeN, perhaps ndiswrapper isn't being loaded at boot .. make sure you have an entry for it in /etc/modules
06:25	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: let me look it up.
06:25	<samliu>	I have a quadro fx1400go :D
06:25	<LoLeN>	k ;)
06:25	<pawbie>	LoLeN: System ->	Administration ->	Restricted Modules (I think)
06:25	<FastZ>	unop: maybe it was...i'm not sure.  I havent done a fresh install on my server machine since dapper and it's been a LAMP server ever since.
06:25	<nickrud>	^V^ did you get the question about showing me the output of   sudo fdisk -l ?
06:25	<pawbie>	I haven't used Ubuntu in a year...
06:25	<gogeta>	pawbie did you say p133
06:25	<amirman84>	mattycoze: i've gotten a similar thing before, i just ignored it like it was no big deal
06:25	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: it usually worked well previously in 7.10. i haven't tried it yet in 8.04
06:25	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I never had this problem before.  Before I updated to Hardy, video works, graphics worked, no lines or anything.  I have trouble believing this is a hardware issue.  Furthermore, prior to using envy, compiz and videos worked fine.
06:25	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i was, but it was because i had broken packages installed (in my case, a few language packs). i removed the offending packages, and i'm upgrading now :)
06:25	<bullgard4>	mc shows an entry prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). I found that this means a "stale symlink". What is a 'stale symlink'?
06:25	<pawbie>	gogeta: Ya!  I still have one.
06:25	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, nice, you goin from 7.10?
06:25	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, is there anyway I can just get rid of envy, and have Ubuntu install the driver it was originally using?
06:25	<^V^>	nickrud: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64314/
06:25	<amirman84>	mattycoze: keep in mind i'm a total noob but my system is running extremely stable so far
06:25	<gogeta>	pawbie oh cant run ubuntu on that well if it has 64mb of ram i guess better with puppy or dsl
06:25	<nickrud>	bullgard4 a broken one? try looking at it with ls --color , if it's red it's broken
06:26	<pawbie>	gogeta: debian
06:26	<LainIwakura>	talcite: My ifconfig, iwconfig, lshw -C network, lspci, and lsmod are here, if that helps: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4785960#post4785960
06:26	<gogeta>	pawbie yea but it will be slow
06:26	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, yeah. solely because i wanna update libconfuse so i can install awesome wm (i can't install the lib from source for some reason)
06:26	<jeffimperia1>	newbie finally got it... woohoo!
06:26	<hellmitre>	heya kids
06:26	<tannewt>	hi all, how do I add a script to run oon suspend and resume?
06:26	<pawbie>	gogeta: Not really.  Debian + AMP + VNC + XFCE4...  happy.
06:26	<unop>	FastZ, looks like even dapper had it - http://www.debianadmin.com/ubuntu-lamp-server-installation-with-screenshots.html
06:26	<kindofabuzz>	I haven't tried this yet, but those of you that had Broadcom working in Gutsy and now broke in Hardy, and don't have access to a ethernet cable, try this: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64313/  found in forums, may try it tomorrow
06:26	<hellmitre>	wondering how to run network manager
06:26	<ceil420>	when i get a new computer, i'm putting Debian Stable on this one and making it a server, anyway. but in the meantime, i'm still using Xubuntu
06:26	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: Use the envyng to remove your drivers and revert them to the radeon drivers
06:26	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, heh i'm upgrading for several reasons. but of course, they always say its the best version ever. then again, any developer says that :P
06:27	<FastZ>	unop: if i remember correctly, you had the option at initial installation to install the LAMP server...or a regular server
06:27	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: Well other people are saying that b43 should be used
06:27	<nick_>	hello
06:27	<harriseldon>	hellmitre: nm-applet
06:27	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, lol, gotta try and get their product out there :p
06:27	<hellmitre>	that's the applet, yeah, but whenever I run that, I get nothing
06:27	<Kurtis->	oh, lovely
06:27	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: you can't get the b43 if you don't have internet access
06:27	<FastZ>	unop: regular server being one without the AMP part of the LAMP install
06:27	<nick_>	Ubutu 7,1 is cooll
06:27	<hellmitre>	nothing goes into the panel
06:27	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: your card isn't supported by b43 yet. I'd say stick with ndiswrapper for awhile longer until they release support. Keep looking every few months though. Ndiswrapper is a sub-optimal solution
06:27	<unop>	FastZ, well, if you install and use tasksell , you have the option on any ubuntu/debian machine :)
06:27	<KyleK>	ceil420: im running ubuntu on my server :) but its just personal server
06:27	<nick_>	where can i start learning more about ubunut
06:27	<james_>	 anyone here got a kworld atsc 110?
06:27	<Kurtis->	FATAL: Could not open /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/modules.dep.temp for writing: Permission denied
06:27	<nick_>	i just got it
06:27	<nickrud>	^V^ my suspicion is that the there's a difference between the contents of /boot on the root partition, and the contents of the /boot partition. Try looking at menu.lst with /boot mounted, and without
06:27	<unop>	FastZ, s/tasksell/tasksel/
06:27	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, yea. and i LOVE the way they are selling this one "all OS's come with things you'll never use. ubuntu 8.04 comes with an uninstall feature" LOL
06:27	<allyunion>	I have a weird problem with my Toshiba U200 laptop, if I mute the sound in Windows, reboot and enter into Ubuntu, the sound doesn't work (even though I have everything set max for all controls)
06:27	<Johnny_>	hi i am having a problem and need some help
06:28	<ceil420>	FastZ, a LAMP server is more or less 'regular'. i don't know why it'd be without the 'A' part, seeing as Apache rocks (and is probably the most ubiquitous server software out there)
06:28	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: i see. well its not critical, cos i have no wifi at the moment so.. i'll do that =)
06:28	<Kurtis->	got that when I issued modprobe ndiswrapper && depmod -a
06:28	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I hit uninstall ATI driver in the EnvyNG gui, but how do I reinstall the original raedon drivers?
06:28	<Kurtis->	as root
06:28	<Johnny_>	can someone please help me
06:28	<samliu>	allyunion, you need audio drivers
06:28	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: thanks for confirming for me =)
06:28	<ceil420>	lol Shadow_X; that's awesome XD
06:28	<harriseldon>	hellmitre do you get console output? can you check if the process is already running?
06:28	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: I have b43 working already. It comes with the disc.
06:28	<pawbie>	ceil420: tomcat!
06:28	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: no problem
06:28	<LainIwakura>	not working, but I mean it's installed
06:28	<mikebot>	Why is it that when I tried to install from the alterate CD, it seems like the upgrader is still fetching files from this internet?
06:28	<allyunion>	samliu: I have snd-hda-intel installed
06:28	<hellmitre>	it does nothing. absolutely blank console when I run it in terminal, harriseldon
06:28	<samliu>	hmm
06:28	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: well i sure wish you'd write a guide, i'm sure thousands would aprreciate it
06:28	<ceil420>	KyleK, mine's personal as well; file server, web site host (perhaps two sites in the future), IRC bot, mebbe a coupla other things
06:28	<Kurtis->	well, got no error that time, but it's still not working
06:29	<talcite>	LainIwakura: your chipset is supported by b43. Not b43-legacy. b43
06:29	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: -_- ill give your method a try
06:29	<pawbie>	ceil420: squid is a must.
06:29	<FastZ>	ceil420: nowadays sure, but before, you had to install all the components of a LAMP server on your own, then came the LAMP server installer option...
06:29	<allyunion>	samliu: And when I do have the audio set to max in Windows, and reboot, the audio works fine in Ubuntu
06:29	<ceil420>	pawbie, squid?
06:29	<harriseldon>	nick_ http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/ has some screecasts which may help
06:29	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work
06:29	<Johnny_>	what do i do
06:29	<pawbie>	ceil420: squid proxy.  Check it out.
06:29	<Shadow_X>	w00t i'm upgrading!!!
06:29	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: well how did you get your's working?
06:29	<cob>	Lainlwakura: looks like ndiswrapper is loaded in kernel, did you upgrade to hardy or fresh install?
06:29	<Shadow_X>	im nervous though. last time i upgraded my server....it failed to boot again >.>
06:29	<talcite>	LainIwakura, eugenebythesea: http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43
06:29	<Johnny_>	some1 help me
06:29	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: no it's not
06:29	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: cheers
06:29	<bullgard4>	nickrud: Yes, it shows the pathname and filename red with a black background.
06:29	<kindofabuzz>	oh thought you said it was
06:29	<ceil420>	FastZ, i still don't have MySQL or PHP installed :x i need to find a use for a database so i can learn MySQL. Of course, the 'P' in LAMP for me means Perl ;)
06:29	<Shadow_X>	Johnny_, whats up?
06:29	<ripps>	AdrianStrays: just a sec
06:29	<pawbie>	Shadow_X: If everything went right the first time, it wouldn't be near as interesting.
06:29	<james_>	Shadow_X, too bad you can't remove somethings
06:29	<talcite>	granted, the updates on that site will be a few months newer than the ones in the repo
06:29	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:29	<nickrud>	bullgard4 so for mc, stale link means broken link
06:30	<LainIwakura>	talcite: am i not using b43?
06:30	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: Were you the one also using bcm4311?
06:30	<LainIwakura>	Kurtis- yes
06:30	<pawbie>	ceil420: Insert, select, drop, delete, optimize.  You know sql now.
06:30	<bullgard4>	nickrud: Thank you very much for explaining.
06:30	<Kurtis->	I'm using revision 2
06:30	<harriseldon>	hellmitre what about output from nm-tool?
06:30	<ceil420>	pawbie, i'll hopefully remember that after i upgrade; while upgrading i only wanna run xchat and conky (so no terminal or firefox)
06:30	<allyunion>	pawbie: LOL
06:30	<mikebot>	How do I use the alternate CD?
06:30	<ripps>	AdrianStrays: Try sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-driver-radeon
06:30	<ceil420>	pawbie, lol
06:30	<jim_beam>	does anyone know if i deed to re-install ati drivers after 7.10 to 8.04 upgrade
06:30	<Kurtis->	that says that it needs a patch for kernel 2.6.24
06:30	<Kurtis->	what sort of a patch?
06:30	<amirman84>	is there any way to transfer my wubi install to a real one?
06:30	<nickrud>	bullgard4 haven't used mc for a while, nice piece of software, no?
06:30	<Shadow_X>	i think my server issue was from lack of knowledge of linux. im sure i couldve fixed it had I tried
06:30	<pawbie>	amirman84: dd
06:30	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:30	<amirman84>	pawbie: dd?
06:31	<hellmitre>	harriseldon: says I'm connected via eth0 (wired)
06:31	<kindofabuzz>	they shouldn't have relesedhardy until wireless worked for all.  especially if it worked in gutsy and now it doesn't
06:31	<pawbie>	amirman84: man dd
06:31	<cob>	Johnny_: how long did you wait?
06:31	<amirman84>	oh ok
06:31	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, it was unable to lock the admin directory
06:31	<mattycoze>	amirman84 aha! success, it installed nicely
06:31	<mattycoze>	amirman84 and happens to be working
06:31	<Johnny_>	cob awhile
06:31	<pawbie>	kindofabuzz: 2 words.  Screw Broadcom
06:31	<Johnny_>	over 10 mins
06:31	<nickrud>	jim_beam 8.04 has the latest driver from ati already, no need to install the one from the website
06:31	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i just set up my apache server a long time ago with some basic options and never touched it again :p it just starts up with my computer
06:31	<Kurtis->	Still can't get my chip to work
06:31	<Shadow_X>	jim_beam, i would think not. although im not sure. i expect the upgrade tool would handle packages with no problem. however, if you have problems with X afterwards, I would advise you to reinstall them then
06:31	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, nevermind
06:31	<amirman84>	mattycoze: awesome, i'm glad you were saved of the headaches i went through
06:31	<kindofabuzz>	pawbie: well i like Linksys
06:31	<LainIwakura>	talcite: I have b43-fwcutter installed already
06:31	<talcite>	LainIwakura: I thought you said you were using ndiswrapper?
06:31	<pawbie>	kindofabuzz: Screw linksys, too.  Atheros ftw.
06:31	<jim_beam>	thanks
06:31	<LainIwakura>	talcite: no i wasn't
06:31	<talcite>	LainIwakura: and have you loaded fw onto the card?
06:32	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, okay I did that.  Restart?
06:32	<bullgard4>	nickrud: I like mc very much. Particularly for its clear arrangement and small footprint.
06:32	<LainIwakura>	talcite: How do I do that?
06:32	<adil>	kk
06:32	<kindofabuzz>	pawbie: never heard of Atheros
06:32	<talcite>	LainIwakura: http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43#devicefirmware
06:32	<Johnny_>	can some1 help me please
06:32	<nickrud>	bullgard4 yes, and it's great for looking inside deb packages when your gui is broken ;)
06:32	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, yea, i was running ubuntu for the server. its an apache and file server. i tried upgrading, and it failed to boot so idk. im nervous about this upgrade :P
06:32	<talcite>	LainIwakura: the nice thing about wireless is that its more or less the same across the distros
06:32	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:32	<pawbie>	kindofabuzz: Google ubiquiti wireless.  Best cards ever.
06:32	<Kurtis->	talcite: know what it means about the patch needed for 2.6.24?
06:32	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:32	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:32	<FloodBot2>	Johnny_: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
06:32	<talcite>	LainIwakura: you can probably take that info as-is
06:32	<samliu>	usually when I upgrade I completely remove my lamp and reinstall it
06:33	<talcite>	LainIwakura: let me look into it
06:33	<Johnny_>	srry
06:33	<samliu>	cause its not really a hassle
06:33	<Johnny_>	can some1 please help m
06:33	<Johnny_>	e
06:33	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, restart?
06:33	<harriseldon>	hellmitre then at least network manager itself is working, just not the applet
06:33	<LainIwakura>	talcite: I'm a little confused but I will give that link a try.. thanks
06:33	<nickrud>	Johnny_ no one is sure, have you run the disk check on the startup menu
06:33	<XceII>	try a reburn Johnny_
06:33	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: Which revision are you using of that chipset?
06:33	<bullgard4>	nickrud: May God give that my GUI does not break.
06:33	<amirman84>	pawbie: i kind of frigured i would be copying files over but which folders do i need and which folders should i totally NOT copy?
06:33	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i'm kinda nervous because i haven't backed anything up; i'm hoping i won't have any problems :x
06:33	<LainIwakura>	kurtis- rev 1
06:33	<Johnny_>	nick i cant nothing works
06:33	<cupajoe>	Oh my, well I hope to be heard above all this noise XD. Hi I have a quick question, I just installed Ubuntu and I can't figure out how to get my sound to work. I'm a generally advanced user though treat me like a basic one because this is my first time using Ubuntu
06:33	<samliu>	Johnny_ try using the alt disk
06:33	<Kurtis->	damn
06:33	<Johnny_>	when i hit enter
06:33	<ceil420>	wish i had a nice external HDD to back stuff up on :x
06:33	<samliu>	I think I remember something similar
06:33	<kindofabuzz>	talcite: i tried to follow that site but when i run make, i get alot of errors, and my hardy is not onliine to get the packages required to fix those errors, someone needs to make a deb of that page
06:33	<Pradalvr>	Hello ! i need some help here ..i need to partition my hard drive and don't know how
06:33	<nickrud>	Johnny_ reboot, and run the diskcheck
06:33	<Johnny_>	what is the alt disk
06:33	<pawbie>	amirman84: Ah, no, just use dd.  Boot the wubi install, prepare a partition on a physical disk, then dd if=wubipartition of=mynewpartition and walk away for a while.
06:33	<Shadow_X>	lol im already having problems. the upgrader complains about unsupported packages and stops >.>
06:33	<mikebot>	Is #ubuntu-offtopic a channel for ONLY off-topic discussion, or it allows off-topic discussion?
06:34	<samliu>	alternative version
06:34	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: are you also using bcmxxxx?
06:34	<ripps>	AndrianStays: Always
06:34	<samliu>	uh
06:34	<samliu>	h/o
06:34	<Shadow_X>	they need more repository servers :P
06:34	<^V^>	nickrud: there isa  difference. It shows the old menu.lst
06:34	<hellmitre>	ah!
06:34	<talcite>	LainIwakura: sorry, what did you mean by kernel patches? you shouldn't need to install any others
06:34	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: well i'm on gutsy now
06:34	<hellmitre>	fixed it, harriseldon
06:34	<hellmitre>	thanks!
06:34	<pawbie>	amirman84: you could also using something like g4u or whatever the other Ghost4Linux package is.  Or you could even use ghost.
06:34	<nickrud>	^V^ it? you mean, the /boot partition?
06:34	<^V^>	yes
06:34	<bcgrown>	anybody know how I can make my geforce fx 5500 show the entire screen on tv-out instead of just the top left corner?  I am using nvidia-glx-new drivers and twinview
06:34	<Kurtis->	talcite: I was the one who mentioned kernel patches
06:34	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:34	<LainIwakura>	talcite: i don't recall mentioning that... ?
06:34	<^V^>	nickrud: the boot partition has not been updated
06:34	<Pradalvr>	I have two separate hard drives..one for windows and the other for Ubuntu
06:34	<amirman84>	pawbie: i'm really confused
06:34	<Shadow_X>	anyone know how to upgrade from the alternate cd?
06:34	<seamus7>	Pradalvr when you install Ubuntu it offers to set up your partitions ... you could also use GParted from the Live CD (I think it's on there)
06:34	<ricree>	can anyone help me with a keyboard problem?  My num lock no longer seems to work after the upgrade
06:35	<Kurtis->	talcite: "# bcm4311 rev 2 / bcm4312 (needs patches for 2.6.24) "
06:35	<supersako>	is it still better to use envy or is the ubuntu restricted drivers better now??
06:35	<talcite>	kindofabuzz: you probably have unsatisfied dependencies.
06:35	<wayne_>	woooo I love Hardy!!!!
06:35	<jim_beam>	is there a link for64bit kernel
06:35	<supersako>	i love Hardy more!
06:35	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
06:35	<pawbie>	amirman84: Hm.  You have a wubi install, and want to put it on a physical disk, yes?
06:35	<kindofabuzz>	talcite: i know i do, it's a fresh install of Hardy
06:35	<nick_>	Can anyone sugeest a good media player for ubuntu for all my music and that
06:35	<ricree>	although the keyboard light turns on when I do hit the numlock key
06:35	<DShepherd>	supersako, no need for envy
06:35	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, that sounds about like what i had. check the /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log (i think that's the one) and see which packages are failing. i only had four files in that folder (and one of them was blank), so it won't take too long to go through them all :p
06:35	<gogeta>	supersako envy = bad
06:35	<Shadow_X>	nick you can try songbird
06:35	<amirman84>	pawbie: the wubi install i'm using resides in the partition that i want to copy it to
06:35	<supersako>	cool
06:35	<pawbie>	Johnny_: Try hitting space, or click, or tab.  Or download and burn again.
06:35	<PFC_Tabasco>	supersako: I got nvidia_glx_new to work without a lot of trouble, but sadly it wasn't nearly as easy as 7.10
06:35	<seamus7>	nick_ Amarok
06:35	<kindofabuzz>	talcite: but i can't satisfy those dependancies cause not online
06:35	<eugenebythesea>	hi - for hardy, should i use ndiswrapper version 1.9? i want to know if that is the latest one
06:35	<wayne_>	while 1 { me.truelove(Hardy); }
06:35	<ricree>	nick_: I prefer rhythmbox, others like amarok
06:35	<amirman84>	pawbie: yeah, that's it
06:35	<Johnny_>	i burned twice
06:35	<pawbie>	amirman84: Oh.  Good luck.  You can dd to a network location and then restore from there?
06:35	<supersako>	Tabasco what do u have to do?
06:35	<nickrud>	^V^ ok,  Me, I'd mount it at /mnt and simply copy over all the stuff in boot on the root to the /boot partition
06:35	<nick_>	how do i get amarok
06:36	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, does ndiswrapper not have a website to tell you the latest version?
06:36	<LainIwakura>	same.. i can't get online to apt-get
06:36	<Pradalvr>	seamus7 I'm there and don't know how to use it
06:36	<gogeta>	Johnny_: md5 iso make shure its not bad
06:36	<pawbie>	nick_: apt-get install amarok ?
06:36	<ricree>	nick_: synaptic or apt-get
06:36	<supersako>	amirman hehe i knew an amir from los angeles that was born in 84 :p
06:36	<Baxtor>	Hey guys, ive just received an IDE HDD from a friend (crappy 20gig one) so i can load some stuff on there for him, how does one change the owner of the drive so i can delete the items currently on there and reformat it into a diffrent file system using ubuntu?
06:36	<pawbie>	nick_: Try exaile
06:36	<ceil420>	nick_, ewwww KDE. but yeah, apt-get works
06:36	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420>	i don't know
06:36	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: did you try that method i posted?
06:36	<Johnny_>	what is md5 iso
06:36	<nick_>	so whats the best
06:36	<pawbie>	Baxtor: Just reformat it.  No need to do the other steps.
06:36	<amirman84>	pawbie: so is dd or ghost basically creating an image of my disk?
06:36	<nick_>	haha
06:36	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, google is your friend :)
06:36	<gogeta>	Baxtor just format it
06:36	<nickrud>	!md5sum | Johnny_
06:36	<ubotu>	Johnny_: To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM for more
06:36	<mikebot>	Can someone help me with te alternate CD?
06:36	<cupajoe>	Bueller? Bueller? Anyone?
06:36	<nickrud>	!who | Johnny_
06:36	<ubotu>	Johnny_: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
06:36	<Kurtis->	I prefer KDE myself and am actually using Kubuntu, but my problem isn't Kubuntu-specific.
06:36	<PFC_Tabasco>	supersako: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment your restricted repos, apt-get update and then go the the Hardware Drivers option in System->Administration
06:36	<Shadow_X>	Baxtor, i believe using GParted would solve those issues
06:36	<Baxtor>	can you just use Gparted?
06:36	<seamus7>	Pradalvr: are you dual booting with Windows or installing Ubuntu on a maching by itself?
06:36	<pawbie>	amirman84: Ya.  The trick with the wubi bit, though, is that you need to boot wubi to "see" your wubi install.
06:36	<amirman84>	supersako: i was born in 84 but in Iran
06:36	<gogeta>	Baxtor yep
06:36	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420>	hm. i could find out about that - but what i really want to know - if .. is that version suitable for hardy?
06:36	<Baxtor>	cheers
06:37	<talcite>	kindofabuzz: I see. I doubt we'll get a .deb for it soon though. I don't think there's anything you can do in the mean time
06:37	<Johnny_>	thanx for the afvice
06:37	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, hmm. try apt-cache showpkg ndiswrapper <=- i think that's the command to show you Ubuntu's current version of the package
06:37	<Johnny_>	srry i am new to irc
06:37	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420>	cool =) thanks for that
06:37	<ceil420>	np
06:37	<Johnny_>	pawbie: i am not sure what ti di
=== rat32 is now known as Palace_Chan
06:37	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: i'm not sure how to configure ndiswrapper though. i had no problem with fwcutter in gutsy
06:37	<dystopianray>	what version of fglrx does hardy have?
06:37	<kindofabuzz>	talcite: i think i tried to make a deb from gutsy but i don't think it worked
06:37	<talcite>	Kurtis-: I'm not sure which patch its referring to. We're on a pretty recent version of 2.6.24. Have you tried b43 with the firmware?
06:38	<gogeta>	dystopianray i dunno ask google :P
06:38	<nickrud>	Johnny_ no problem If I may, I'd suggest you use   xchat   for irc, works better out of the box than pidgin does
06:38	<Baxtor>	ahh... unmount the drive so you can re-format it.. silly baxtor *duh*
06:38	<Kurtis->	I downloaded the b43-fwcutter package
06:38	<amirman84>	pawbie: when i was looking at where wubi is installed from windows i noticed that there are quite a few ISO's it seems like i should be able to install ubuntu brand new on the partition and restore my system from those ISOs... is that possible?
06:38	<Kurtis->	and that didn't work
06:38	<Kurtis->	I'll try compiling it myself, I guess
06:38	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: Ndiswrapper's latest version is 1.52 as of a few weeks ago
06:38	<cupajoe>	﻿I have a quick question, I just installed Ubuntu and I can't figure out how to get my sound to work. I'm a generally advanced user though treat me like a basic one because this is my first time using Ubuntu

06:38	<backharlow>	anyone know how to fix system after Heron dist upgrade dies in the middle?
06:38	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: try http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64313/ then rebott, i can't try it yet because i haven't upgraded yet
06:38	<mikebot>	Or is there a help page for the alternate CD?
06:38	<pawbie>	amirman84: I don't know.  Try it and let me know if it works.
06:38	<Johnny_>	i am on a mac and am using colloquy

06:39	<cupajoe>	Harriseldon: yes sir
06:39	<samliu>	Johnny_ you have to stop flooding
06:39	<samliu>	we know your problem
06:39	<samliu>	I'm looking for the link to the alt disk
06:39	<pawbie>	Johnny_: Do you have friends you can talk to in person?
06:39	<samliu>	this is really weird cause its not on the list haha
06:39	<pawbie>	samliu: http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/
06:39	<Johnny_>	not about this
06:39	<samliu>	ah yeah
06:39	<nickrud>	Johnny_ when you say you hit enter, you mean you can't even boot up and run the disk check?
06:39	<mikebot>	samliu: Can you answer questions regarding the alt cd?
06:39	<samliu>	thats it
06:39	<Johnny_>	no one knows comps
06:39	<amirman84>	pawbie: good call, i think i'm just going to try it out, if i lose this system that would suck but unless they get that LMVP tow ork with 8.04 i don't have many good options
06:39	<samliu>	johnny_, click that, download it etc
06:39	<nick_>	why doe ubuntu work better than windwos
06:40	<Johnny_>	nick rud: yes
06:40	<cupajoe>	It's a realtek ALC262 I believe
06:40	<Johnny_>	nickrud: i cannot get anything to run
06:40	<RoAkSoAx>	how to reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
06:40	<drivetrax>	learning here.. how to have synaptic get my file
06:40	<samliu>	no its just that I remember having a similar problem and using the alt disk solved it
06:40	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I did what you said, and videos work now.  However, the resolution is screwed up and compiz was off.  Restarted compiz and was prompt to install ATI Accelerated Drivers, I'm going to restart now and see if the resolution is better
06:40	<ezzieyguywuf>	do i need to install xgl-xserver in order for compiz to work?
06:40	<nickrud>	Johnny_ you need to be more specific. What is anything?
06:40	<amirman84>	nick_; because it's foundation is an open source code
06:40	<mlw1>	Hey, thanks for everyone who is answering questions I have another:  My monitor runs at 1920x1200, and I'm able to select that, but upon logging out, it defaults back to 1680x1050, and I can't figure out how to change this
06:40	<gogeta>	Johnny sounds like a bad iso chceck the md5
06:40	<nick_>	o ok
06:40	<Armored_Azrae1>	Hey, does anyone know how to get evolution to use kerberos tokens?
06:40	<Shadow_X>	nick_ its in the design of linux itself. its Unix based. so its built securely from the ground up. its a difficult thing to explain unless you have a solid foundation in computer/network security
06:40	<samliu>	if it isn't the bad iso, I think it might have to do with either ram or if its an old computer
06:40	<^V^>	nickrud: thanks
06:40	<samliu>	what kind of system do you have johnny_
06:40	<nickrud>	^V^ all good?
06:40	<Johnny_>	nickrud: when i hit enter nothing runs at all not even the check
06:40	<nick_>	when i search up amarok in packet manager theres heaps f different aarok packages what one should i install
06:41	<pawbie>	Armored_Azrae1: That would be awesome.  Let me know if you figure it out.
06:41	<RoAkSoAx>	how to reconfigure xserver-xorg??? what parameters should i use in dpkg-reconfigure "parameters" xserver-xorg???
06:41	<zero>	is there any way to get conky embedded to my deskotp like it is in DSL or puppy?
06:41	<ceil420>	drivetrax, run the synaptic program. it's a graphical installer; pretty easy. right click on a package you want and select 'Mark for Installation', then when you're done, click "Apply" at the top
06:41	<pawbie>	nick_: The one that just says "amarok"
06:41	<SecretGirl>	i'm trying to install ubuntu on my laptop from an external CDROM but the installation stops at 90% on "Loading module "aec62xx" for IDE chipset support", any ideas how to fix this
06:41	<Armored_Azrae1>	Damn. I tried selecting gssapi, but it doesn't seem to get the picture :P
06:41	<^V^>	nickrud: about to reboot and find out ;) but this is an annoying bug in (k)ubuntu
06:41	<DShepherd>	Johnny_, have you verified the md5sum for the ISO that you downloaded?
06:41	<pawbie>	SecretGirl: Try noacpi ?
06:41	<talcite>	Johnny_: Check the MD5 hash of your CD. It may have been burned incorrectly
06:41	<drivetrax>	thanks
06:41	<nick_>	pawbie cheers
06:41	<zero>	SecretGirl, boot with acpi and apm off
06:41	<SecretGirl>	whats that?
06:41	<pawbie>	SecretGirl: Better yet - google for the make and model of your laptop and see if anyone else has tried it before.
06:41	<Johnny_>	dshepard: i cannot dind the md5 check for the mac
06:41	<mikebot>	samliu: Or any page that talks about the alt cd?
06:41	<Shadow_X>	is there anyway to do a "normal" install of KDE without ubuntu becoming Kubuntu?
06:41	<ezzieyguywuf>	do i need to install xgl in order for compiz to work?
06:42	<cupajoe>	The sound doesn't work on my integrated speakers nor if I plug a pair of headsets in
06:42	<pawbie>	Shadow_X: You can install KDE from synaptic, and then change your session at the login screen.
06:42	<zero>	SecretGirl, i had this problem, just tyep boot acpi=off apm=off and it shoudl work, worked for me
06:42	<nickrud>	Johnny_ wow, it's probably in your terminal.  md5sum /path/to/iso
06:42	<DShepherd>	doesnt mac have md5sum ?
06:42	<pawbie>	Shadow_X: Try xfce4.
06:42	<nick_>	whats the difference between unix and linux
06:42	<talcite>	ezzieyguywuf: compiz should work almost out of the box
06:42	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: what ubuntu version are you running and what video card?
06:42	<zero>	is there any way to get conky embedded to my deskotp like it is in DSL or puppy?
06:42	<pawbie>	nick_: A few letters.
06:42	<Koheleth>	morning
06:42	<SecretGirl>	zero, how do i do that
06:42	<DShepherd>	nickrud, ok, i thought so too
06:42	<cupajoe>	And I'm sure that my volume is up though I'm not quite sure if everything is configured correctly
06:42	<kindofabuzz>	l
06:42	<samliu>	oh God its hard to read things in this channel xD
06:42	<ezzieyguywuf>	hardy heron and I have a firegl V5200 (lenovo t60p)
06:42	<nick_>	pawbie haha sweet
06:42	<cupajoe>	(well obviously not because then I would hear sound
06:42	<red_>	hi..got a problem with my internet speed. downloading and web browsing is very slow. usually my speed is 20kbps now its 6kpbs sometimes below than that. any help pls...
06:42	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: doesn't seem to work
06:42	<nickrud>	DShepherd I'm just guessing, but really ....
06:42	<ceil420>	zero, conky was designed to be embedded to the desktop. if it's not there when you run it, you're doing it wrong :o
06:42	<Shadow_X>	pawbie,  i know i can install kde. but when i did that a year ago, it "transformed" into kubuntu
06:42	<DanaG>	Heh, mirrors.kernel.org is still giving 560 kilobytes per second.
06:42	<talcite>	LainIwakura: how is the firmware loading coming?
06:42	<DShepherd>	nickrud, yeah.. really....
06:42	<mlw1>	can anyone tell me why my xorg changes don't go through?  I select 1920x1200 as my resolution in nvidia-settings, it works fine, I save it to xorg, that works, then I reboot, and the changes are gone
06:43	<nick_>	wish i could program so i could help make stuff
06:43	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: i was thinking you may have to uncooment the b43xxx also
06:43	<SecretGirl>	zero, where do i type that
06:43	<Koheleth>	anyreason why Konversation takes a while to start in Hardy Heron?
06:43	<zero>	ceil420, its in a window on all my computers
06:43	<Kurtis->	nick_: Unix isn't open source
06:43	<Kurtis->	Linux is a clone of it
06:43	<ezzieyguywuf>	I'm getting that 'no composite extension available" error, which in the past was solved with xgl, but i think the other day someone said something about heron not needing it?
06:43	<samliu>	oh right
06:43	<pawbie>	mlw1: When I use the nvidia app, it doesn't actually write over xorg.conf....   Try hitting "Show Preview" and cut and pasting that into a new xorg.conf
06:43	<zero>	SecretGirl, its in the boot options of the CD to type that, hit f5 when you boot into the CD
06:43	<samliu>	mikebot
06:43	<kindofabuzz>	so you'd blacklist the two things but un blacklist bcm43xx
06:43	<mikebot>	samliu: Yes.
06:43	<samliu>	ah
06:43	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, many Unices are open source; OpenSolaris, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc
06:43	<samliu>	thats why
06:43	<samliu>	the alt CD doesnt have the live bootup
06:43	<Kurtis->	Well, yeah
06:43	<Kurtis->	But THE Unix isn't
06:44	<mikebot>	samliu: I'm sorry?
06:44	<pawbie>	samliu: No GUI.
06:44	<ceil420>	zero, weird :o i've never even seen it have a window of it's own. look at the .conkyrc's they have on the conky home page and see how they have theirs set up
06:44	<samliu>	right
06:44	<red_>	hi..got a problem with my internet speed. downloading and web browsing is very slow. usually my speed is 20kbps now its 6kpbs sometimes below than that. any help pls...
06:44	<LainIwakura>	talcite: no idea how to do it.. i'm really a novice
=== insub is now known as Geedorah
06:44	<samliu>	so it can install in situations the normal disk may come across issues
=== boomer` is now known as boomer
06:44	<samliu>	which is a good reason why Johnny_ should try it
06:44	<talcite>	LainIwakura: have you compiled a binary from source before?
06:44	<samliu>	unless people have better suggestions lol
06:44	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, Bell Labs' UNIX(R) isn't, no :p
06:44	<Johnny_>	ok does anyone have any advise
06:44	<usser>	nick_, i'd say different heritage, most unixes go way back whereas linux is a pretty recent thing
06:44	<pawbie>	talcite: What are binary?
06:44	<Johnny_>	that i will know how to do
06:45	<zero>	ceil420, what?
06:45	<SecretGirl>	zero, f5 is for accessibility options, is that the one
06:45	<pawbie>	Johnny_: samliu mentions trying the alt CD.  Did you try that?
06:45	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, and actually, i think their original Unix was open source. they went closed source later on (maybe as late as System V)
06:45	<kindofabuzz>	linux is only 10 years old
06:45	<mikebot>	Can someone hep me with upgrading from the alt CD?
06:45	<Kurtis->	hmm
06:45	<LainIwakura>	talcite: i know how to type ./configure and make. does that count?
06:45	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: i'm running hardy heron and I have an ATI V5200 video card
06:45	<Johnny_>	pawbie: binary is the language that the computer naturally understands it is made of 1 and 0s
06:45	<Seveas>	ceil420, nope, Bell Labs' Unix was always closed iirc
06:45	<samliu>	!tab Johnny_ pawbie provided the link earlier
06:45	<Johnny_>	pawbie: idk what u mean
06:45	<pawbie>	Johnny_: Hey!  Good job.
06:45	<harriseldon>	kindofabuzz 1991 was only 10 years ago?
06:45	<samliu>	er
06:45	<talcite>	LainIwakura: please don't forget which changes you make by the way. You'll have to undo them to test other methods.
06:45	<samliu>	lol
06:45	<eugenebythesea>	ceil420, talcite: the latest ndiswrapper in the repos is 1.50 - so i'll just go with that. blacklisting b43 and getting my driver now
06:45	<SecretGirl>	zero, f5 is for accessibility options, is that the one
06:45]  * xepra needs help
06:45	<talcite>	LainIwakura: that's all you need
06:45	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: have you installed build-essential?
06:45	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: both fglrx and the open source drivers support aiglx now
06:45	<ceil420>	zero, there are example .conkyrc files at http://conky.sourceforge.net - base your conkyrc on one of them and modify as necessary
06:45	<xepra>	Anyone know grub and mbr well?
06:45	<Johnny_>	pawbie: good job about what
06:45	<LainIwakura>	talcite: alright.. i'm going to give ndiswrapper a try first
06:45	<pawbie>	Johnny_: http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/  Go there, find the link that says "alternative" for 8.04, and try that one.
06:45	<samliu>	xepra whats the problem
06:45	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: go ahead. 1.50 is fine
06:45	<Seveas>	Johnny_, watch out, I patented the 1!
06:45	<zero>	SecretGirl, its one of the f keys i cant remember exactly wich one
06:45	<LainIwakura>	Kurtis- Yes I installed that
06:45	<Koheleth>	xepra: whats up mate
06:45	<samliu>	I have some experience
06:45	<nickrud>	!md5 | Johnny_
06:45	<ubotu>	Johnny_: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
06:45	<kindofabuzz>	harriseldon: i could've sworn linux didn't relese the kernel until 1998
06:45	<xepra>	I am getting "error 22" on my grub
06:46	<zero>	thanks ceil420
06:46	<kindofabuzz>	linus#
06:46	<xepra>	I accidently told ubuntu server to write grub to mbr
06:46	<Shadow_X>	anyone know how to upgrade from the new alt cd?
06:46	<xepra>	I tried reinstalling, but it didn't work
06:46	<MrObvious>	I can't get b43-fwcutter to work quite right. My wireless is really slow and I'd like it to work.
06:46	<Johnny_>	there is no md5check for the mac
06:46	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, alright, everything appears to be in working order, and also, it seems like that line issue I was talking about was mysteriously resolved in the process.  What was that command you told me to use to get the driver?
06:46	<Koheleth>	xepra:  I am not a grub man
06:46	<samliu>	oh
06:46	<samliu>	super grub boot disk
06:46	<ceil420>	Seveas, maybe i was tired at the time and i'm thinking of something different, but i was recently reading about the history of Unix, and i think the earliest versions were open. That might have been before Bell took on the project, though
06:46	<xepra>	unfortunate
06:46	<nickrud>	Johnny_ ok, another link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM has exact instructions for the mac. First thing, check to make sure you have a good download
06:46	<Koheleth>	try googling it
06:46	<dystopianray>	kindofabuzz: linux was first released in 1991
06:46	<samliu>	it has an auto fix for that situation
06:46	<kindofabuzz>	MrObvious: how did you even get it to work? lol
06:46	<talcite>	LainIwakura: you'll probably have less chance of having ndiswrapper work. It has several bugs regarding WPA authentication
06:46	<pawbie>	xepra: http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm#21
06:46	<samliu>	hold on
06:46	<mikebot>	Or can anyone direct me to a FAQ or information page on the alt CD?

06:47]  * cupajoe raises hand
06:47	<talcite>	LainIwakura: look at http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43#fw-b43-old
06:47	<Koheleth>	How do I edit Grub?
06:47	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: ok, so I guess aiglx is better than xgl? How do I install this cuz currently I cannot enable compiz, I get "desktop effects could not be enabled" when I try to from system>>preferences>>appearence
06:47	<AdrianStrays>	Alright, thanks.  For the link and the help!
06:47	<samliu>	http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/
06:47	<Johnny_>	the instructions wont work for it
06:47	<Koheleth>	!grub
06:47	<ubotu>	grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
06:47	<talcite>	LainIwakura: follow those instructions. It should work. Don't forget to un-blacklist b43
06:47	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: what drivera re you using for your video card?
06:47	<nickrud>	Johnny_  md5 /path/to/iso , that doesn't work?
06:47	<zero>	SecretGirl, you get it?
06:47	<LainIwakura>	talcite: my question is this: isn't what is on that page already installed in hardy?
06:47	<samliu>	!xepra
06:47	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about xepra - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
06:47	<samliu>	http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/
06:47	<Johnny_>	nickrud: idk what the path is
06:47	<kindofabuzz>	harriseldon: my bad, i saw somehtin that was 10 years old this year and it mentioned Linus
06:47	<talcite>	pawbie: a binary is a program
06:47	<samliu>	please have a look :D
06:47	<xepra>	is there a way to remove grub from mbr completely?
06:48	<Johnny_>	i am on a mac and dont know how to check path
06:48	<MrObvious>	kindofabuzz: What do you mean?
06:48	<amirman84>	so when i drag windows around, they are wobbly and awesome, is the compiz-fusion at work?
06:48	<LainIwakura>	talcite: Because I already have b43-fwcutter installed
06:48	<pawbie>	talcite: Fail. :\
06:48	<samliu>	download the disk, boot up, follow the screens
06:48	<MrObvious>	kindofabuzz: I just did the restricted thingy and it worked.
06:48	<samliu>	its pretty straightforward
06:48	<nickrud>	Johnny_ the path is the file folder structure.
06:48	<samliu>	it'll rewrite your mbr and grub stuff
06:48	<samliu>	:D
06:48	<Johnny_>	nickrud: what does that mean
06:48	<h00k>	I am having a problem getting an external NTFS drive to automount in Hardy.  Gutsy automounted, but Hardy will not.
06:48	<mikebot>	samliu: Is that to me?
06:48	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: I can't tell. In gutsy, I was prompted on my first boot up to install restricted drivers, but for Hardy I was not asked that, nor could I find the option in System>>administration. How can i check which driver I am using?
06:48	<Johnny_>	nickrud: can we private chat
06:48	<harriseldon>	kindofabuzz there is a good documentary called revolution os about linux history. it covers the 1999 time frame, but very good
06:48	<kindofabuzz>	MrObvious: most people can't even get b43cutter working at all, at least your is working
06:48	<talcite>	LainIwakura: no idea. I don't know what hardy installs by default. I would make sure you have the firmware installed just to be sure
06:48	<gnuskoo1>	my ubuntu hardy is slower than my xp install, what gives?How do i make sure my intel graphics card is running optimum, it's way too sluggish at the mo?
06:48	<Johnny_>	nickrud: to get rid of this clutter
06:48	<samliu>	no its to xepra sorry mikebot
06:48	<samliu>	lol
06:48	<jhoc2x>	hello to all.... ^_^ im back
06:48	<talcite>	LainIwakura: also, use the b43-firmware cutter from that page
06:48	<kindofabuzz>	harriseldon: yeah i been meaning to watch that
06:49	<pawbie>	yay, Grub error 21 again.
06:49	<pawbie>	hm
06:49	<nickrud>	Johnny_ I've never used a mac, so I can't tell you how the mac's file structure is laid out. But I'm sure there's some info on the mac sites
06:49	<MrObvious>	kindofabuzz: I don't know. I have the bcm94311 chipset.
06:49	<talcite>	LainIwakura: it seems to be version specific
06:49	<mikebot>	nickrud: Do you know about the alt CD installation?
06:49	<SecretGirl>	f6 is for other options, i wrote what you said and hit enter, now its booting
06:49	<SecretGirl>	zero, what is the problem exactly?
06:49	<samliu>	gnuskoo1: disable advanced desktop effects
06:49	<LainIwakura>	talcite: ok i'll do that now
06:49	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: hrrm i'm not entirely sure as xorg.conf no longer displays the driver in use
06:49	<talcite>	LainIwakura: alright. Good luck. I need to sleep. Exam tmr =/
06:49	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: try running the restricted drivers thing manually
06:49	<samliu>	sorry guys I'm out to bed
06:49	<LainIwakura>	talcite: thanks
06:49	<gnuskoo1>	samliu: they arent even on, i get a compiz error when i try enable them

06:50	<cupajoe>	﻿I have a quick question, I just installed Ubuntu and I can't figure out how to get my sound to work. I'm a generally advanced user though treat me like a basic one because this is my first time using Ubuntu. I am, however, sure that the volume is turned up in the software and not muted. I'm running on a laptop with integrated speakers, I believe it uses Realtek hardware. I don't know how to figure out what driver Ubuntu is using for it
06:50	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: yea so i'm kinda stuck. I just did a clean install. the other day i upgraded from gutsy, and got compiz to work after installing xgl but it was sluggish and buggy, so i'm trying to find alternatices
06:50	<Shadow_X>	anyone know how to upgrade from the new alt cd?
06:50	<Kurtis->	Okay, I'm going to have to edit menu.lst to cut the time from 10 seconds to 3 or something
06:50]  * dsmith_ was able to avoide the new release this time yay! I downloaded 8.04 ahead of time and updated just now... Sweet
06:50	<MrObvious>	kindofabuzz: I might have to ndiswrapper this stuff. :

06:51	<pawbie>	This freaky bird background has got to go.l
06:51	<LainIwakura>	talcite: ok
06:51	<talcite>	or kernel. Either may turn something up
06:51	<Kurtis->	don't like the heron?
06:51	<kindofabuzz>	its a heron
06:51	<jhoc2x>	is it tux?
06:51	<talcite>	I think the heron's quite nice
06:51	<harriseldon>	Peddy: afaik, you would have to enable pulseaudio like hardy has installed.
06:51	<talcite>	anyways. night guys
06:51	<kindofabuzz>	heroin heron
06:52	<Kurtis->	okay, what the hell, this still isn't working
06:52	<backharlow>	heron destroyed everything. i just lost a lot to the failed upgrade
06:52	<supersako>	uhh i just deleted my bars on the top right for the wireless networking how do i get it back?? :(
06:52	<LainIwakura>	Kurtis- this makes me want to go back to gutsy

06:52	<teban>	hi
06:52	<jhoc2x>	LainIwakura: why?? is hardy not fine?
06:52	<Kurtis->	Well, I'm afraid Gutsy never worked on this laptop

06:52	<Kurtis->	did on my previous...
06:53	<jhoc2x>	Kurtis-: how so?
06:53	<LainIwakura>	jhoc2x: i'm sure it is.. i'm just having great difficulty setting up my wireless
06:53	<Shadow_X>	tico, the version if firefox that comes with 8.04 is beta 3. its still in beta testing so there are no extensions available yet
06:53	<r00723r0>	I just found the most beautiful theme ever but the matching icons won't work :(

06:54	<pawbie>	Ok, someone sanity check this for me.
06:54	<Kurtis->	tico: Firefox 3.0 isn't compatible with most 2.0 extensions
06:54	<Shadow_X>	tico, the version if firefox that comes with 8.04 is beta 3. its still in beta testing so there are no extensions available yet

06:56	<harriseldon>	karllenz how did you share it?
06:56	<ezzieyguywuf>	ok guys, my ATI Fire GL driver is checked, but right next to the check box it says "not in use". What could be causing this?

06:58	<kindofabuzz>	mikebot, just put it in and follow directions
06:58	<jhoc2x>	i think it still needs time to jump to 8.04
06:58	<Shadow_X>	disregard my previous question as I found the answer :)
06:58	<forevertheuni>	bah..my upgrade app always freezes at the beggining

06:58	<forevertheuni>	:/
06:58	<nickrud>	mikebot it is extremely simple, and self explanitory
06:58	<karllenz>	harriseldon: i see my mac in my network servers but there is nothing there
06:59	<soreau>	How come Hardware Drivers do not list nvidia card as it did with RDM in Feisty?
06:59	<harriseldon>	karllenz try using places connect to server -- try it as a windows share. I do not know what mechanism osx uses by default. you may want to find that out first
06:59	<dystopianray>	karllenz: then it must not be sharing anything
06:59	<nickrud>	^V^ ah, you're using the hardy kernel now :)
06:59	<mikebot>	nickrud: It seems that at file 1085 of 1228 it starts downloading from the internet.
06:59	<forevertheuni>	what's the new line at sources.list to replace gutsy?
06:59	<^V^>	nickrud: yes :)
06:59	<mikebot>	nickrud: Instead of off the CD..
06:59	<supersako>	harris i tried that but its not the one that was there default
06:59	<Shadow_X>	just a quick question. where there any last minute updates made today after the official release?
06:59	<nickrud>	mikebot alt-f8 will show the install log, you can see for sure what it's doing
06:59	<orven>	is it normal that packages are showing as 'unauthenticated'?
06:59	<kindofabuzz>	i wonder if there's anyway to upgrade from the hardy iso?

07:01	<harriseldon>	supersako I thought it was nm-applet, maybe it changed in hardy
07:01	<supersako>	could be??
07:01	<supersako>	i keep typing in nm-applet nothing happens
07:01	<mikebot>	nickrud: I mean, I thought that I would be installing from the CD, not downloading from the internet.. alt+f8 is not doing anything.

07:10	<cellofellow>	this question is NOT ABOUT HARDY: should I set up the rsync daemon to use xinetd like this (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/rsync) says, or use a regular UNIX daemon? (I'm trying to get BackupPC working.)
07:10	<^V^>	nickrud: thanks
07:10	<Liquid-Silence>	but I cant run dual monitors
07:10	<markf>	whu not using a torrent file?
07:10	<nickrud>	jeffimperial you can try disabling all your sources, except for the cdrom. It probably won't work, since you'd have some broken packages.
07:10	<leonbrussels>	SecretGirl: probably a malburnt CD. Try the check cd for defect option in the boot menu

07:10	<dsop>	does someone have problems with the framebuffer in hardy?
07:10	<h00k>	harriseldon: now I disconnected the drive and got I/O errors again, unable to read partition table.  This isn't cool, I'll see what I can do
07:10	<Kurtis->	anyway, bye
07:10	<nickrud>	^V^ thank me if it works ;)
07:10	<zelrikriando>	how to make compiz work again on hardy
07:10	<zelrikriando>	?
07:10	<kimmey>	I was running update-manager to update to hardy. When it update-manager started to remove old packages my power went down. How may I fix this?
07:10	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, I'm using a Raedon Xpress 1100 card.  I've been having massive amounts of issues since upgrading, and in all honestly, I'm having trouble remembering all the things we've done.
07:10	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: how 'bout just turning off my modem? would the Upd. Mgr. still continue to work if i just unplug it?
07:10	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Doesn't it work?
07:10	<Waffle>	Arelis, what message are we not supposed to ignore?
07:11	<SecretGirl>	CD is fine
07:11	<Nahi>	can anyone help me in cpanel stuff i recently got a server and im trying to make users for cpanel
07:11	<dny>	my sound keeps going out, and i have to reboot for it to start again.  is there a way to restart alsa or something? :/
07:11	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: lots of things got broken when I upgraded
07:11	<nickrud>	jeffimperial it'll try to download from the net, but get 404's. Then you can depend on breakage
07:11	<cupajoe>	﻿﻿I have a quick question, I just installed Ubuntu and I can't figure out how to get my sound to work. I'm a generally advanced user though treat me like a basic one because this is my first time using Ubuntu. I am, however, sure that the volume is turned up in the software and not muted. I'm running on a laptop with integrated speakers, I believe it uses Realtek hardware. I don't know how to figure out what driver Ubuntu is using for it
07:11	<SecretGirl>	leonbrussels, someone recommended booting with  acpi and apm off, i did that and now i'm at a command prompt. what should i do now
07:11	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: I cant even start the synaptic manager
07:11	<pawbie>	argh
07:11	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: OPen up a terminal and type compiz. Thne give the output
07:11	<pawbie>	Grub fragged my stripe set.
07:11	<xepra>	cupajoe: sometimes the drivers don't work by default, I never could get them to work right in fact
07:11	<Arelis>	Waffle: the chat about release partying - because, yesterday, many people were coming in and saying "Hardy got released!", so people wouldn't get good support
07:11	<h00k>	harriseldon: any ideas off the top of your head?
07:11	<Shadow_X>	im trying to upgrade to hardy, and even after removing unsupported packages, the upgrade still fails and complains that it can calculate the changes. any ideas?
07:12	<harriseldon>	SecretGirl is this a macbook pro?
07:12	<cupajoe>	Well that's depressing :/
07:12	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays the end of your question got cut off
07:12	<leonbrussels>	SecretGril: Try pressing Control+D and it will normally continue booting normally
07:12	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: oh well... three hourse and 122 files to go then.. thanks anyway
07:12	<leonbrussels>	SecretGirl: Try pressing Control+D and it will normally continue booting normally
07:12	<Arelis>	Waffle: err, chat = message
07:12	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: http://pastebin.com/m45855108
07:12	<cupajoe>	Anyone else have thoughts?
07:12	<mlw1>	hey again, I'm having some big problems connecting to a sftp server in 8.04.  It worked fine and extremely fast on 7.10, but now using connect to server and specifying the same settings gives me errors after about one folder access.  Any ideas?
07:12	<harriseldon>	h00k I have no idea, it seems like a hardware issue. do you have another computer to test with? even a 7.10 live cd if that worked before
07:12	<xepra>	cupajoe:  google around, sometimes you just have to build/install your own
07:12	<xepra>	which isn't too bad
07:12	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: the synaptic package manager is more important I guess
07:12	<nickrud>	jeffimperial yeah, the downside of using a net oriented os. I used to update debian unstable over a modem, so I have only a little sympathy ;)
07:12	<supersako>	do we need to install the simple ccsm now for compiz?
07:13	<pawbie>	supersako: Fusion-icon
07:13	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, this may be easier: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=765749
07:13	<cupajoe>	Well I can install my own but I don't quite have the level of skill needed to build a driver
07:13	<the_darkside_986>	does Ubuntu Hardy still support single-core 32-bit CPU like Intel Celeron?
07:13	<h00k>	harriseldon: I'll try a live CD, I have some other utils I can try.  It /just/ worked today, newer drive, backed up all my info to it before my upgrade
07:13	<SecretGirl>	harriseldon, no, a compaq nx9010
07:13	<Nahi>	i have cpanel installed but i dunno how to use it
07:13	<supersako>	im reading this thing that says u need to dl a new thing called simple-ccsm
07:13	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: yes, of course it does
07:13	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: thanks man.. at least i can stop wondering.. have to leave the effing room so that i could maximize the bandwidth..  laters
07:13	<harriseldon>	SecretGirl I saw some macbook pro threads with the same error, I will keep checking
07:13	<jeanre>	hi all
07:13	<SecretGirl>	leonbrussels, control+d dush do anything i'm still in the built in shell
07:14	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: yes
07:14	<jeanre>	hi all0ModeLine "1280x800" 80.58 1280 1344 1480 1680 800 801 804 8270?
07:14	<the_darkside_986>	ok. and i386 is the right iso?
07:14	<jeanre>	err
07:14	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, that is the beginning.  The problem has changed alittle.  Now when I switch off compiz, videos work fine and the lines are gone, when I switch it back on, the lines show up, a bit less, and videos are blinky and have lines all over them.
07:14	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Is synaptic broken?
07:14	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: yes
07:14	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: thats like 90% of all computers, so of course
07:14	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: yeah
07:14	<jeanre>	is there any reason why I can not run 1280x800 on with nvidia drivers?
07:14	<mlw1>	is there a terminal command to change the resolution of a monitor that I could add to my session commands for startup?
07:14	<Cusoon959>	I blacklisted ssb in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist along with b43. b43 is no longer loading, but ssb is. How do I fix this?
07:14	<SecretGirl>	does anybody know how to install ubuntu from the shell

07:14	<m8m8y8>	jia hao
07:14	<leonbrussels>	zelrikirando: What does it say?
07:14	<Arelis>	Hello, everybody. I want to get my Wacom Bamboo Fun (which is an USB tablet you connect to the pc, used to draw pictures or animations on a computer, or write some things down) to work with Ubuntu Hardy. Many people had 'promised' (somewhat) that the Bamboo Fun would automatically work in Hardy. Up to now, it doesn't. There's not even a /dev/input/wacom . So how do i get it to work?
07:14	<m8m8y8>	youren ma
07:14	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays ah, if it's only with compiz, ask in #compiz-fusion. They know how that interacts with the various video drivers
07:14	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: sounds like you'll need the alternate install cd
07:15	<leonbrussels>	 zelrikriando: What does it say?
07:15	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, I already tried them, no one responded.
07:15	<the_darkside_986>	ok thanks. and is this the correct output of uname -a on my system that has Intel Celeron 3.2 Ghz: "Linux hardy-desktop 2.6.24-16-generic #1 SMP Thu Apr 10 13:23:42 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux" ?
07:15	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays cdlrb, watch for him.

07:15	<Tweaker>	Hola, I got a question about another game...Its called Eclipse and it allows you to build your own ORPG and I've got it working, but I can't enter the admin panel with the F1 button, why is this?
07:15	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, I believe it has something to do with xorg.conf
07:15	<harriseldon>	Tweaker is it native or through Wine?
07:15	<Tweaker>	Through Wine
07:16	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays crldb maybe, one of those meaningless character strings. He's already in bed probably, but is around nearly daily, for long periods
07:16	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: that s weird...I can run it through the terminal
07:16	<SecretGirl>	dystopianray, the cd is fine i checked and there's no problem, its an original cd that i ordered
07:16	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: i think SMP means dual core/multi procs
07:16	<damo22>	hi im trying to add cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
07:16	<SecretGirl>	does anybody know how to install ubuntu from the shell, step by step
07:16	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: still, it sounds like you'll need the alternate install cd
07:16	<harriseldon>	Tweaker F1 is already mapped in gnome, you need to change the mapping there first. Gnome hot keys will be use before wine
07:16	<h00k>	harriseldon: Well, I turned the drive off for a bit, moved the usb cables a little, and it works now, automount and all.
07:16	<the_darkside_986>	yeah that's why i am worried. and it would explain the awful behavior of the whole system. but it doesn't act like that on the live cd
07:16	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, alright I'll try back in the morning
07:16	<mlw1>	anyone know what I might be doing wrong to have my display resolution overwritten on every reboot?
07:16	<Tweaker>	Ok, how do I do this Harriseldon.?
07:16	<jeanre>	does anyone have any ideas on this
07:16	<h00k>	harriseldon: that scared me.  thanks for letting me think out loud about it ;)
07:17	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays between you and me, I don't use compiz on my 1100, it's just to freaking slow
07:17	<jeanre>	my mode line does not work
07:17	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: all ubuntu is going to support SMP, so you're using the right one
07:17	<harriseldon>	h00k anytime, I am glad that it worked
07:17	<Aces|>	Anyone know if the Hardy Live CD has better Nvidia Graphics driver support than Gusty Gibbon did?
07:17	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: try typing sudo apt-get install gedit
07:17	<ChrisULM>	got a problem with hardy, i have a panel with icons at the bottom of my desktop, but when i restart it moves the panel to the top. whats going on?
07:17	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: if performance isn't very good, you probably need to enable the nonfree video driver
07:17	<damo22>	hi im trying to add hardy cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
07:17	<nickrud>	Aces| it has the latest nvidia driver, while gutsy's was months out of date
07:17	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: You already have that installed, but it will tell you where it chrashes
07:18	<the_darkside_986>	I already have the non-free nvidia driver setup. The whole system lags and startup time is extremely long.
07:18	<zenlunatic>	Aces|: from my experience so far, yes.  all the multiverse etc is default
07:18	<knapsack_>	Anyone know if there is an eclipse PDT (PHP Development framework) package in any Ubuntu repos?
07:18	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: it s not crashing
07:18	<Aces|>	ok thanks nickrud I just had quite a bit of troubling installing 7.10 with the live cd so I ended up having to use the alternate
07:18	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: what do you mean by "lags"?
07:18	<Aces|>	Ok thanks
07:18	<Arelis>	For anyone who wants to get a Wacom Bamboo Fun to work in Ubuntu, click this link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4787309#post4787309
07:18	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, I think I'll disable it for now, I'm just frustrated that I went from Gusty, where everything worked, to Hardy where all I've had is graphics issues. I was kind of hoping things would get better.  Thanks anyways
07:18	<Aces|>	Ill give it a try
07:18	<SecretGirl>	dystopianray, if there was a problem with cd, wouldn't the scan for defects return something
07:18	<Acoustyk>	Hardy is lagging!
07:18	<Kl4m>	the_darkside_986: generic kernel enables SMP only if it can. the SMP mention is because it supports it.
07:18	<jeanre>	why cant I run 1280x800?
07:18	<amazing_lady>	8.04 is cool
07:18	<Acoustyk>	anyone know any quick fixes for this?
07:18	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: So only synaptic is crashing?
07:18	<xepra>	anyone know xen well?
07:18	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: only from the taskbar
07:18	<Tweaker>	Does anyone know what the F1 key does in gnome so I can unassign it?
07:18	<NukeSkyjumper>	Acoustyk: obviously, you haven't given any details of the problem
07:19	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: not if the problem is related to hardware incompatibilities
07:19	<the_darkside_986>	Everytime I start a process such as synaptic, it seems that it tries to hog the CPU and even the mouse cursor freezes for a while.
07:19	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays all I can say is everything worked fine for me (beta install nearly 2 months ago, and updates since then. First time that Works for Me™ :)
07:19	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: I can start it from a terminal
07:19	<Acoustyk>	lol
07:19	<harriseldon>	Tweaker, I do not see the setting for F1 in keyboard shortcuts.  I am not sure where it is being "trapped"
07:19	<Acoustyk>	well when browsing I notice lag in the scrolling
07:19	<Acoustyk>	very jagged and what not
07:19	<xepra>	anyone know xen well? I had a question on the gui...
07:19	<harriseldon>	Tweaker, does Eclipse have any way to remap the keys?
07:19	<Acoustyk>	also my boot time has doubled
07:19	<Tweaker>	Hmm, could it be some were else then?
07:19	<Tweaker>	Sadly no it does not, F1 always opens the Admin panels
07:19	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: try disabling "visual effects" in the Appearance settings
07:19	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: "sudo: unable to resolve host shipon " why is that?
07:20	<Acoustyk>	and I have an Application problem alert upon logging in
07:20	<the_darkside_986>	I've already disabled visual effects.
07:20	<pawbie>	I am so pissed off at 8.04 right now.
07:20	<pawbie>	hm
07:20	<jeanre>	Ok guys I am running the nvidia driver
07:20	<zenlunatic>	Acoustyk: wow.  lots of problems
07:20	<Acoustyk>	yea
07:20	<jeanre>	I can not get 1280x800 to work for some reason even tho the lcd I selected is 1280x800
07:20	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Weird, dunno, maybe you  just want to do a clean install but copying your home directory so you can keep all you settings, thats what I'm gonna do when it finished copying
07:21	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: I dont want to do that
07:21	<jeanre>	I can go 1280X720
07:21	<soreau>	Why would Hardware Drivers in Hardy not list an nVidia card as it did with RDM in Feisty?
07:21	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Then I don't know, sorry :(
07:21	<SecretGirl>	i have installed ubuntu before on the laptop
07:21	<SecretGirl>	no problems then, but i do have some malfunctioning hardware, do u think it has something to do with it
07:21	<SecretGirl>	cant i install ubuntu from a command prompt
07:21	<nickrud>	Tweaker Acoustyk isn't it alt-f1 for the panel menus?
07:21	<leonbrussels>	bye everybody, whish me luck for installing
07:21	<Acoustyk>	yea
07:22	<Shadow_X>	what would happen if i added the 8.04 cd to the 7.10 repositories in synaptic?
07:22	<the_darkside_986>	A "sudo apt-get update" must be done to let non-free nvidia card drivers show up in the hardware manager if you didn't let the installer "scan the mirrors" during installation.
07:22	<Acoustyk>	no problems with the panel other than a slight delay
07:22	<Tweaker>	Uhm Im talking about the Panels in this game.F1 opens them and would alt F1 still affect the key mapping?
07:22	<devin_>	anyone know of a way to resize the terminal and keep it at your desired size?
07:22	<Acoustyk>	I found a tweak to solve the same problem in 7.10 tho
07:22	<NukeSkyjumper>	Shadow_X: you would be upgrading to Hardy, which does work. however, that usually causes little bugs here and there
07:23	<nickrud>	Acoustyk it's modifiable, in metacity at /apps/metacity/global_keybindings, and compiz in ccsm in general options, keybindings tab
07:23	<Shadow_X>	NukeSkyjumper, just wondering. because i keep getting upgrade errors while trying to do a "normal" upgrade and im getting sick of it lol
07:23	<nickrud>	Acoustyk unless I've totally missed the question ;)
07:23	<Shadow_X>	i have my stuff backed up anyway, so im not too concerned about a failure during upgrade
07:23	<Acoustyk>	lol yea you did
07:23	<Acoustyk>	im having lag problems
07:23	<damo22>	hi im trying to add hardy cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
07:23	<nick_>	im on ubuntu 7.1 just installed it 2 days ago would upgrading to 8 be better is there better support
07:23	<nickrud>	I threw in that caveat when I saw you say lag just before :)
07:24	<NukeSkyjumper>	Shadow_X: if you edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and change "gutsy" to "hardy" and then upgrade all packages, you should get a working hardy system
07:24	<Wavesonics>	monitors works via GUI in 8.04!!!
07:24	<Johnny_5>	so i guess the consensus is that gutsy may still be better than hardy
07:24	<Wavesonics>	:)
07:24	<Acoustyk>	yea
07:24	<nickrud>	nick_ gutsy will have support for another year right here, as well as hardy
07:24	<Shadow_X>	hmm ok. i'll try that
07:24	<Johnny_5>	that's kinda what i've been gathering
07:24	<laiya>	hi
07:24	<Wavesonics>	in 8.04 I cant enable "normal" effects
07:24	<Wavesonics>	getting crash
07:24	<nickrud>	Johnny_5 I'm voting hardy big time
07:24	<nick_>	sweet
07:24	<Johnny_5>	heh
07:25	<laiya>	hey how do i cascade the windows ?
07:25	<NukeSkyjumper>	Wavesonics: do you have the nonfree video driver enabled?
07:25	<Johnny_5>	i'm just not convinced i need 2 upgrade from gutsy quite yet
07:25	<nickrud>	I've run every release, and breezy for me was the most trouble free one, but hardy is running close
07:25	<harriseldon>	Tweaker have you tried a virtual desktop with wine (use winecfg)? I am just guessing here since I do not know
07:25	<Wavesonics>	NukeSkujumper: I dont think so, should I?
07:25	<Tweaker>	Give me a second and I can try that
07:25	<Wavesonics>	I have an ATI card
07:25	<NukeSkyjumper>	Wavesonics: yeah, it'll enable 3d support
07:25	<nickrud>	Johnny_5 waiting a couple weeks is not a bad idea, just in case some bad bugs suddenly crop up and need fixing
07:26	<NukeSkyjumper>	though i'm not sure how much better the nonfree ATI driver is than the open source one
07:26	<Wavesonics>	ok
07:26	<NukeSkyjumper>	you should still try it
07:26	<ricree>	devin_: not that I know of.  However, the man page says that if you add --geometry=(number of chars horizontal)x(number of chars vertical) it will set your terminal to a specified size by default
07:26	<Johnny_5>	ah...
07:26	<nickrud>	Wavesonics if you have a 9550 or later, you will need the restricted one to run 3d apps
07:27	<laiya>	i recently saw a video of ubuntu where they were able to cascade the windows and it looked quite cool .. how does one do that ?
07:27	<devin_>	ricree ill give it a try
07:27	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: System >	Preferences >	Advanced Desktop Settings. it's in there, somewhere
07:27	<harriseldon>	laiya it may have been with compiz-fusion (aka desktop effects)
07:28	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: though you probably need to "sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager" first
07:28	<XceII>	ya^
07:28	<mudd`Hossam>	question: can ext3 filesystem and ntfs file system exist on one driver under different partitions? thank you
07:28	<damo22>	i want to upgrade from feisty to hardy can i just do "dist-upgrade" ?
07:28	<dystopianray>	mudd`Hossam: yes of course
07:28	<nickrud>	mudd`Hossam yes
07:28	<Acoustyk>	anyone know how to stop lag in firefox 3 on hardy?
07:28	<prodigel>	Hi. I'm having problems with gdm or something from gnome. My desk freezes just from checking properties on a panel applet, or trying to change desktop background. Alt+tab and other window shortcut keys still function. Could you help me trace to problem?
07:28	<mudd`Hossam>	more specifically (a raid0 array of two drives)
07:28	<mudd`Hossam>	YES, thank you very much
07:28	<nickrud>	damo22   do-release-upgrade   is preferred
07:29	<NukeSkyjumper>	Acoustyk: nobody knows what you mean by "lag". you need to be more specific
07:29	<Acoustyk>	the scrolling is awfully jagged
07:29	<Lardarse>	does anyone know what happened to the "xmms" package? it's in gutsy but not hardy
07:29	<ricree>	Acoustyk: what is the cpu usage like?
07:29	<harriseldon>	prodigel once you are in gnome, gdm is out of the picture
07:29	<tijn>	Lardarse, i know!! :(
07:29	<nickrud>	damo22 it does some checks specific to ubuntu (don't ask me exactly what they are, one of the uber-geeks told me that)
07:29	<Acoustyk>	how do I check that in ubuntu?
07:29	<tijn>	Bring back XMMS!!
07:29	<timr92>	what's XMMS?
07:29	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: installing
07:29	<XceII>	Lardarse:  check add remove, but first allow backports

07:30	<nickrud>	tijn they replaced it with xmms2
07:30	<Lardarse>	XceII: i did
07:30	<hugol1>	hi, my nvidia doesnt work sine I installed hardy. In Launchpad a lot of people is complaining about the same. Anybody knows a way to solve it?
07:30	<ricree>	Acoustyk:  System>Administration>System Monitor
07:30	<Acoustyk>	i never knew how to check that on ubuntu
07:30	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: how will that app help me ?
07:30	<tijn>	xmms2 is a client server modell?
07:30	<Acoustyk>	ok
07:30	<XceII>	interesting, mine has it
07:30	<Lardarse>	nickrud: umm... that sounds like a step backwards...
07:30	<Prez00>	what's the feedback coming in, generally good, bad, average?
07:30	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: that app lets you configure all of the window managing effects
07:30	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Also, the top comand line utility will do that
07:30	<laiya>	oh ok
07:30	<prodigel>	harriseldon: ok, so something freezes in gnome and I don't know why. I've waited for updates hoping it will be solved, but nothing. Now 8.04 was launched and I'm still having problems
07:30	<nickrud>	damo22 it's a command unto itself , /usr/bin/do-release-upgrade
07:30	<r00723r0>	I'm going to cry.
07:30	<r00723r0>	I just found the most beautiful theme ever but the matching icons won't work :(
07:30	<WGGMk>	I guess I can talk about Hardy in this channel now?????

07:30	<FloodBot2>	r00723r0: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
07:31	<Lardarse>	Prez00: generally good from the people who did clean installs, and bad from people who upgraded... go figure
07:31	<r00723r0>	Not flooding.

07:31	<nickrud>	Lardarse which does?
07:31	<Prez00>	Lardarse: great... i am looking to upgrade...
07:31	<Wavesonics>	Hi, i'm trying to enable my ATI proprietary driver and it says "Invalid xorg.conf"
07:31	<Lardarse>	Prez00: back up as much as you can
07:31	<WGGMk>	Is anyone else getting this systems asses handed to them by firefox3??? on hardy heron???
07:31	<Lardarse>	nickrud: <nickrud>	tijn they replaced it with xmms2
07:31	<Tweaker>	HarrisEldon: I love you :D It worked, thanks man! I owe ya and this IRC
07:32	<Prez00>	Lardarse: guess I could clean install... got all my drive partitioned, /home is partition, so I guess I can go for clean reinstall
07:32	<Acoustyk>	ricree: cpu usage is at 40%
07:32	<nickrud>	Lardarse heh. I don't use either, just keep track of what changes
07:32	<Halsafar>	I have installed Ubuntu 8 on a machine that cannot get internet access, period.  I need to install packages via cdrom.  I used apt-cdrom add, apt-get update and the update always ignores the cdrom "Ign: cdrom://ubuntu" -- I have cleared the apt cache dir, even reinstalled the entire distro... same problem
07:32	<ricree>	Acoustyk: mostly firefox?
07:32	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: installed .... how do i configure it ??
07:32	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: open the app and look around, it's self explanatory
07:32	<Tweaker>	Alright Im out thanks for the help
07:32	<nickrud>	Wavesonics try   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , then try the restricted driver again
07:32	<the_darkside_986>	firefox3 isn't doing too much harm on Hardy but the whole system freezes momentarily everytime i open a GUI program. even the GDM login stutters badly. and startup time is miserable. I actually like firefox3 (finally, nice GTK2 form buttons)
07:33	<damo22>	Halsafar: try sudo apt-cdrom -m -d <mountpoint>
07:33	<WGGMk>	Halsafar: open up /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure it isnt commented out
07:33	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: aaww... I was trying to prove to my friend that linux has come far enough u dont have to use the command line to set things up, oh well
07:33	<chronographer>	Hi all. I have my new monitor working perfectly, except when I use the nvidia driver, I seem to be unable to get it to the correct refresh rate... Any suggestions?
07:33	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: where is the app ? im new to linux
07:33	<Acoustyk>	ricree: no it looks like xgl and gnome-do are more
07:33	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: System >	Preferences >	Advanced Desktop Settings
07:34	<nickrud>	Wavesonics bite your tongue, if they took away the command line I'd move to something else
07:34	<Wavesonics>	hehe
07:34	<Wavesonics>	i do love the resolution/dual head tool :)
07:34	<areels>	i want to merge vob files and edit them, like adding watermark
07:34	<Halsafar>	I tried that damo22,apt-cdrom just listed its help menu...  Yes I checked sources.list, it is not commented out.
07:34	<kakalto>	does firefox seriously say "beta 5" when you have it open on 8.04?
07:34	<Acoustyk>	ricree: it spikes when firefox changes a page
07:34	<areels>	what do i need to do that?
07:34	<eugenebythesea>	kakalto: yes
07:34	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: ok i did it, now what
07:34	<zelrikriando>	ok I have compiz to fix now
07:34	<psypher246>	hey all, i need sum help getting ubuntu on the 2gb eee pc. how do i do a base install and build it up from there. i have the alternate cd  but no option for command line install. where to from here?
07:34	<NukeSkyjumper>	areels: watermarking requires one to have no soul, i believe
07:34	<ezzieyguywuf>	how can i detect the temperature on my t60p in hardy heron?
07:34	<nickrud>	kakalto yes, mozilla hasn't released the final yet
07:35	<kakalto>	okay, that's all. Just wanted to verify the insanity o_o
07:35	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Does the slowdown depend on how much javascript or flash is being used on the page?
07:35	<nickrud>	Wavesonics now try the driver manager tool again
07:35	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: try running: acpi -V
07:35	<pawbie>	ezzieyguywuf: Touch it!
07:35	<Wavesonics>	nickrud, i did, doesn't work
07:35	<XceII>	ezzieyguywuf:  gkrellm
07:35	<nickrud>	Wavesonics same error?
07:35	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Also, how much free memory do you have?
07:35	<kakalto>	nickrud, eugenebythesea, do canonical plan on including ff3 final when it is released?
07:35	<prodigel>	harriseldon: can I find somewhere in logs info about this problems?
07:35	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: yes
07:35	<chronographer>	psypher: just install xubuntu
07:35	<chronographer>	its a pain in the arse to try command line installing
07:35	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: i got some text but no temp reading
07:35	<nickrud>	Wavesonics hm, put a copy of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf  on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
07:35	<creative>	hi
07:35	<luderacer>	hi
07:35	<nikitis>	i need help with LVM and Grub.  I can't see my windows install.  Got switched somehow.
07:35	<psypher246>	chronographer: i know it is but how do u do it
07:35	<areels>	hi
07:36	<Acoustyk>	ricree: free swap memory? (and yes flash makes it worse but this page is all text and it slows it down still)
07:36	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: then you must have no temperature sensors accessible via acpi
07:36	<eugenebythesea>	kakalto: i don't know.. sorry =)
07:36	<zelrikriando>	http://pastebin.com/m45855108
07:36	<luderacer>	i lub you all
07:36	<areels>	 i need something like ulead video studio
07:36	<XceII>	lub?
07:36	<chronographer>	er.. download an xubuntu live cd, or alternate cd
07:36	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: it worked in gutsy thoughh. shoud I just reinstall lm-sensors?
07:36	<luderacer>	:)
07:36	<nickrud>	kakalto it'll be in backports for sure, and probably in main
07:36	<XceII>	lol
07:36	<creative>	how can i delete that stuff what hides flashes with a "play" button ??
07:36	<nick_>	just installed amarok all y music on another partiton when i go to import music that partition is not there
07:36	<psypher246>	how do you do a command line install with ubuntu hardy not xubuntu
07:36	<ricree>	Acoustyk: physical memory.  Should be on the left in the System monitor resources tab
07:36	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: does 'sensors' no longer show it?
07:36	<chronographer>	if you do instlall to command line, type 'sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop' i think
07:37	<chronographer>	psy: google it
07:37	<Acoustyk>	ricree: 7.1 gigs
07:37	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: what do you mean by 'sensors'?
07:37	<NukeSkyjumper>	creative: do you mean Noscript for firefox?
07:37	<dystopianray>	nick_: did you mount it?
07:37	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: 'sensors' the program
07:37	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: http://pastebin.com/d4cc3e9ad
07:37	<psypher246>	thanks for the help, not like i just spent 20 mins trying to google it
07:37	<kakalto>	is there a canonical channel? I'm awful confused as to why they've included beta5 (even labelled so, advertising beta-quality program) in their long-term ubuntu release, and yet fail to support any kubuntu as long-term.
07:37	<creative>	i dont know NukeSkyjumper...
07:37	<syrus>	any body have any luck upgrading
07:37	<XceII>	no script is the way to go.
07:37	<ricree>	Acoustyk:  Are you sure about that?
07:37	<nick_>	dystopianray: it's shws up on my desktop
07:37	<creative>	but i cannot see flashes, and i havent got any extensions intstalled
07:37	<barmymatt>	Hi all. Has anyone had any luck with keepassx in AMD64 version?...
07:37	<Acoustyk>	ricree: thats space on my hard drive
07:38	<dystopianray>	kakalto: i don't believe canonical has ever supported kubuntu, they only care about ubuntu
07:38	<ricree>	Acoustyk: what about the RAM
07:38	<nick_>	dystopianray: The partition shows up on my desktop
07:38	<devin_>	ricree i got the command i need to resize the terminal but how or what do i config to save it?
07:38	<dystopianray>	nick_: is it mounted?
07:38	<psypher246>	so since i have already tried googling it, is there anyone else willing to tell me how to do a command line install of ubuntu hardy
07:38	<nick_>	dystopianray:
07:38	<nick_>	dystopianray: how do i tell
07:38	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: are you trying to upgrade from an older version?
07:38	<syrus>	get the alternative cd
07:39	<Acoustyk>	riceree: under memory and swap I have 2 gigs of mem with 369.2 megs being used
07:39	<psypher246>	got oit
07:39	<psypher246>	then what
07:39	<dystopianray>	dystopianray: right click on it on the desktop and see if the option is there to mount it
07:39	<psypher246>	fresh install
07:39	<Wavesonics>	nick_: http://pastebin.com/d4cc3e9ad
07:39	<Acoustyk>	ricree: and 0 bytes of swap
07:39	<zenlunatic>	anyone else having net speed issues in hardy?
07:39	<steindani>	Hi! I'm using U. 8.04, and Intel sound card. There's sound, but I can't control it's volume.
07:39	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: you mean, install ubuntu without the gui installer?
07:39	<chronographer>	hey ZENLUN
07:39	<up365>	syrus, almost there after about 4-5 hrs, restart sys to upgrade
07:39	<psypher246>	YES
07:39	<psypher246>	no
07:39	<syrus>	tyes
07:39	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: that's not a "command line install"
07:39	<eugenebythesea>	<zenlunatic>	no.. it's working better for me than gutsy
07:39	<psypher246>	i just want a command line installed
07:39	<chronographer>	I use a belkin card and my comp went real slow
07:39	<nick_>	wavesonics: ?
07:39	<psypher246>	no not the gui
07:39	<Daisuke_Ido>	ah, you don't want a gui at all
07:39	<seamus7>	hi all ... must one use the alternate CD to upgrade via a CD/DVD?
07:40	<Daisuke_Ido>	seamus7, yes
07:40	<psypher246>	want MININMAL ubuntu installed and then build from there
07:40	<chronographer>	psypher: have you tried putting the disk in and seeing if it is listed as an option?
07:40	<ricree>	devin_: right click on the icon you use to open the terminal and click on properties.  One of the boxes will say command.  Add the --geometry argument you want to use after gnome-terminal in that box
07:40	<psypher246>	yes
07:40	<zenlunatic>	eugenebythesea: me too, but now its acting up my net is 6mb but only getting like 300k on speed test
07:40	<psypher246>	it's open right in from of me
07:40	<psypher246>	no option
07:40	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: if you just install normally, you can ctrl-alt-F1 to get your console
07:40	<Acoustyk>	riceree: get that?
07:40	<zenlunatic>	eugenebythesea: disabled ipv6 and nothing
07:40	<NukeSkyjumper>	and then "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" to take away the gui
07:40	<nickrud>	Wavesonics that's essentially identical to mine, except I have the synaptics touch pad config. You should file a bug. Try running   gksu -D /usr/share/applications/jockey-gtk.desktop /usr/bin/jockey-gtk , and adding the output of that and the copy of your xorg.conf to the report
07:40	<psypher246>	no guys i know how to get to a command line
07:41	<julio_neto>	is possible uptade my ubuntu 7.10 to ubuntu 8.04 by CD???
07:41	<nick_>	howcome abarok can't excess only the filesystem
07:41	<osmosis>	http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/
07:41	<psypher246>	all i want is to install ubuntu on a pc with 2GB hard drive and then add the packages from there that i need
07:41	<dystopianray>	nick_: is the partition mounted?
07:41	<devin_>	ricree got it. thanks for the help
07:41	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Then I'm not really sure what's up.  You might try seeing if it's a javascript issue, but it sounds like something other than firefox is causing the problem and I'm not sure what
07:41	<ricree>	devin_:  You're welcome
07:41	<syrus>	i dont thin u can unless u install server edition
07:41	<eugenebythesea>	<zenlunatic>	hm.. i can't think of some reasons.. did u try things like torrents n dwnload managers?
07:41	<nickrud>	julio_neto mostly, but you'll still need to get some packages from the net if you downloaded them during your gutsy run
07:42	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: if the alternate disc doesn't have the option, and you know enough to do it, i'd almost say try installing debian but using ubuntu apt sources
07:42	<Acoustyk>	riceree: thanks then i appreciate your help
07:42	<nickrud>	julio_neto you'd need to use the alternate cd, as well
07:42	<ricree>	Acoustyk:  Sorry that I couldn't do more
07:42	<chronographer>	﻿<zenlunatic>	what type of network card do you have? if firefox is slow, try disabling ipv6
07:42	<ProwL>	psypher246:
07:42	<Yodude>	hey i'm on hardy and sound isn't working, although it works on GDM burt the minute i login it stops
07:43	<munkie>	psypher246, xubuntu works on a 2gb if this is for the eee
07:43	<chronographer>	Psy: just download the xubuntu CD
07:43	<ProwL>	psypher246: alternate installer cd does indeed have commandline install option, its just in a different place than previous releases. use one of the Fx keys to choose 'mode' and youll see the option
07:43]  * nickrud remembers when 2gb whas freaking _huge_ ;(
07:43	<psypher246>	cool i'll try xubuntu although for what i need it for i would REALLY prefer gnome
07:43	<nick_>	dystopianray: yes
=== dny_ is now known as dny
07:43	<nikitis>	Can someone help me figure out where my windows installation is so I can fix grub?
07:43	<julio_neto>	nickrud, no problem... So, how can i do it? How can I update 7.10 to 8.04' CD?
=== cham_ele1n is now known as cham_eleon
07:43	<dystopianray>	nick_: and yet amarok cannot access it?
07:43	<psypher246>	i really really lreally would rather do a mini,mal base install AS PRE GOOGLE but the option is not there
07:44	<munkie>	you can add gnome to xubuntu later psypher246
07:44	<chronographer>	xfce is great!
07:44	<DracoZA>	Can someone help me my machine crashed and now it seems my gnome is broken, the machine boots up I get startup sound but then the screen goes blank
07:44	<nickrud>	psypher246 gnome won't fit on that drive. not at all
07:44	<Yodude>	anyone knows how to fix sound ?
07:44	<chronographer>	gnome is only a little better!
07:44	<Ziroday>	nikitis: happy to :)
07:44	<nickrud>	psypher246 as handled by ubuntu, that is
07:44	<timfrost>	!alternate | ﻿julio_neto
07:44	<ubotu>	﻿julio_neto: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
07:44	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: check and see if there's a boot option from the alternate disc

07:45	<nickrud>	julio_neto and after you get that alternate cd, just start it, it should offer to upgrade

07:45	<Hans>	Good morning!
07:45	<saross0219>	anyone good with getting the wireless to work on 8.04?
07:45	<nikitis>	Ziroday, ok, when i run fdisk -l i get sdc1 as the ntfs disk.  sda1 is /, sda2 is swap, sda3 and sdb1 is /home on an lvm.  Grub comes up and tries to load up root (hd2,0) but doesn't load up windows
07:45	<chronographer>	!tell ubotu apt-get moo
07:45	<psypher246>	thank you, thats all i wanted
07:45	<DracoZA>	Can someone help me and my gnome please :)
07:46	<psypher246>	where is the documentation for that?
07:46	<`mIRC`>	hi...
07:46	<Hans>	apt-get moo is the reason i switched to linux!
07:46	<`mIRC`>	i heard that ubuntu 8.04 is now released ...
07:46	<chronographer>	anyone new here tried apt-get moo?
07:46	<KyleK>	moo?
07:46	<julio_neto>	nickrud, soo, I'll need run it by ubuntu interface, or get bot with it?
07:46	<Fa>	yes
07:46	<devin_>	Night all .. Tc
07:46	<dystopianray>	`mIRC`: that's right
07:46	<sleepster>	what's new in 8.04
07:46	<Fa>	i just installed 8.04 today
07:46	<Acoustyk>	is it a pain in the ass to do a fresh install of ubuntu directly over top a partitioned ubuntu?
07:46	<`mIRC`>	i just wanna know that, are they fix GRUB??
07:46	<chronographer>	try it
07:46	<eugenebythesea>	<chronographer>	what's that do?
07:46	<Hans>	Yes, 8.04 is out since yesteerday...
07:46	<chronographer>	'apt-get moo'
07:46	<Hans>	-e
07:46	<dystopianray>	`mIRC`: what was wrong with grub?
07:46	<chronographer>	=)
07:46	<Wavesonics>	ok, so i enabled the restricted ATI drivers
07:46	<nick_>	dystopianray: yes it can't
07:46	<`mIRC`>	i found grub error in ubuntu 7.10 many times
07:47	<Wavesonics>	and now the resolution app cant seem to detect my displays
07:47	<chronographer>	oh and the other one is 'aptitude moo'
07:47	<Deathserver>	if i install 8.04 will it change my drivers
07:47	<munkie>	awesome I didn't know the moo trick!
07:47	<dystopianray>	nick_: how are you determining this?
07:47	<aubrac>	The man page doesn't even mention that apt-get is missing its super cow powers.
07:47	<ricree>	`mIRC`:  like what, I  never had any problems
07:47	<nikitis>	Ziroday, Any suggestions?
07:47	<AnRkey>	Congrats to all the devs! You created an awesome release, I love it!
07:47	<timfrost>	﻿julio_neto, nickrud, if you insert the alternate CD in a running ubuntu, it should bring up a dialog box that offers three choices - 1=do nothing, 2=run package manager, 3=run upgrade
07:47	<chronographer>	then you go 'aptitude moo'
07:47	<seamus7>	Anyone thinking of a fresh install of Hardy rather than the network upgrade?
07:47	<AnRkey>	Deathserver, yes
07:47	<sjovan>	any one know of a script to create torrents?
07:47	<chronographer>	﻿u go 'aptitude -v moo'
07:47	<Fa>	8.04 is the best so far
07:47	<`mIRC`>	<ricree>	`mIRC`:  like what, I  never had any problems -- sorry, i have 2 OS's
07:47	<Ziroday>	nikitis: oh sorry, erm can you pastebin fdisk -l please
07:47	<julio_neto>	ahhhhhhh
07:47	<Hans>	One Problem with Hardy i have: there is no sound.
07:47	<chronographer>	﻿u go 'aptitude -v -v  moo'
07:47	<Hans>	Does anyone know a solution?

07:48	<dystopianray>	Deathserver: do you need a particular version?
07:48	<linxuz3r>	!nvidia
07:48	<ubotu>	For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
07:48	<Acoustyk>	is it hard to do a fresh install of ubuntu over top of my partitioned Ubuntu disk?
07:48	<chronographer>	etc.
07:48	<nikitis>	Ziroday, http://rafb.net/p/T1pxzY18.html
07:48	<Ziroday>	Hans: alot of people have been complaining about that, do you have sound during the GDM screen?
07:48	<Deathserver>	the latest if possible
07:48	<chronographer>	its funny!
07:48	<seamus7>	Hans have you played with the volume control options/preferences and switched it around from ALSA / Pulse / etc. ?
07:48	<AnRkey>	seamus7, i used apt-proxy to save some bandwidth
07:48	<ricree>	`mIRC`: I've been dual booting windows since I first installed ubuntu without problems.  I wonder what happened on your system
07:48	<yell0w>	Deathserver: sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre
07:48	<Deathserver>	does it matter which version
07:48	<Hans>	No, no xound during the gdm screen.
07:48	<NukeSkyjumper>	Acoustyk: you'll probably want to wipe out the old one, which is easy
07:48	<dystopianray>	Deathserver: sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
07:48]  * Scrounch is now away: off
07:48	<Hans>	I tested Alsa, Pulse etc. but there is no sound.
07:48	<munkie>	a dead cow????
07:49	<seamus7>	AnRkey: I did a network upgrade and noticed some minor annoyances ... thinking of doing a fresh install
07:49	<Mr>	where exactly can I check pulseaudio?
07:49	<Yodude>	i have no sound too this is crazy
07:49	<chronographer>	Drakoza can you go "ctrl alt F1"
07:49	<CommanderCool>	since i have hardy heron i get an error when trying to mount a ntfs drive...can anyone help me?
07:49	<Yodude>	there must be a fix i can't live without music !
07:49	<Hans>	But i can wait. I think that it is good that many people haves the problem.
07:49	<juning>	?
07:49	<aubrac>	linxuz3r: click System ->	Administration ->	Hardware drivers.
07:49	<damo22>	i want to use hardy cdrom as apt-source... i did apt-cdrom but apt-get update gives me : Ign cdrom://Ubuntu 8.04 _Hardy Heron_ ....
07:49	<Wavesonics>	I enabled my restricted ATI drivers and now the resolution app can't detect my monitors, why?
07:49	<Hans>	That ensures that there will come a fix...
07:49	<AnRkey>	seamus7, i am yet to download the iso's, the servers are very very busy
07:49	<`mIRC`>	<ricree>	i use 2 OS's ... windows and ubuntu ... and probelm i found was....it can't load NTFS filesystem ... and that cause error in boot
07:49	<Ziroday>	nikitis: I think it should be hd3,0
07:49	<DracoZA>	chronographer when I do that I get something that looks like an old ATARI display, I can boot into safe mode though and access a terminal
07:49	<seamus7>	Han have you made sure all the devices are checked so that you can make certain they're not muted?
07:49	<Deathserver>	this one  sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre or this one  sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre
07:49	<Koheleth>	I cant find the linux32 emulator in Heron!
07:49	<sticksabuser>	hey does anyone know whether additional older video cards have been blacklisted in hardy when it comes to enabling compiz?
07:50	<nikitis>	Ziroday, hd3?  i only have 3 drives, so 0, 1, and 2 would be 3 right?
07:50	<dystopianray>	Deathserver: openjdk-6-jre
07:50	<chronographer>	well try changing your xorg.conf
07:50	<gharz>	riqqa anyone?
07:50	<Yodude>	yeah all are unmuted, in fact sound works in GDM, but stops when i enter my account
07:50	<seamus7>	AnRkey: download an iso via bittorrent would circumvent any busy servers
07:50	<Mr>	generally how much times does it take for the big first updates ???
07:50	<chronographer>	try backing it up, then deleting it
07:50	<Deathserver>	what does that one do dysto
07:50	<AnRkey>	seamus7, i have a 3gb limit on my adsl
07:50	<boeing>	is there any way to install an i386 deb on my x86-64 system?
07:50	<dystopianray>	Deathserver: it's java 6
07:50	<DracoZA>	chronographer ive run reconfigure and checked xorg.conf manually it looks fine
07:50	<AnRkey>	seamus7, in south africa :(
07:50	<`mIRC`>	...
07:50	<NukeSkyjumper>	boeing: dpkg --force-architecure file.deb
07:50	<Deathserver>	whats the different commands do
07:51	<seamus7>	AnRkey ohhhhhhh that would be bummer
07:51	<jburd>	How do I upgrade my installatino using the desktop cd?
07:51	<chronographer>	try booting without one, it works for me like that
07:51	<damo22>	i want to use hardy cdrom as apt-source... i did apt-cdrom but apt-get update gives me : Ign cdrom://Ubuntu 8.04 _Hardy Heron_ ....
07:51	<boeing>	NukeSkyjumper, it dint work
07:51	<ricree>	Mr: Took me most of today, although a torrent would likely be faster since the servers are swamped today
07:51	<AnRkey>	seamus7, i love my country, hate the telco company
07:51	<Acoustyk>	NukeSkyJumper: how do I wipe my old Ubuntu?
07:51	<Deathserver>	ive had three diff ones suggested
07:51	<NukeSkyjumper>	boeing: what did it do?
07:51	<Ziroday>	nikitis: ah sorry being daft yes, hd2,0
07:51	<seamus7>	AnRkey I see :)
07:51	<jburd>	I don't want it to delete my home directories and a few other directories
07:51	<NukeSkyjumper>	Acoustyk: there's probably an option to format partitions
07:51	<`mIRC`>	<ricree>	i use 2 OS's ... windows and ubuntu ... and probelm i found was....it can't load NTFS filesystem ... and that cause error in boot
07:51	<Yodude>	anyone heard of a sound fix ?!
07:51	<dystopianray>	Deathserver: the two commands you posted appear to be identical
07:51	<nikitis>	Ziroday, ok, well that's just it, it's set to hd2,0 but it won't load windows
07:51	<Deathserver>	im absolute noob thx for youre help
07:51	<`mIRC`>	and another problem i found was...grub error stage 1.5
07:51	<boeing>	NukeSkyjumper, it showed upgradation necessity of all my other installed packages
07:52	<AnRkey>	seamus7, we get more local bandwidth when our accounts are capped, so i am going to download it when i get capped from a local repos
07:52	<Deathserver>	but you suggest youres
07:52	<ricree>	`mIRC`: Can't really help you there, I've never had that sort of problem when I dual booted
07:52	<CommanderCool>	since i have hardy heron i get an error when trying to mount a ntfs drive...can anyone help me? "...version `FUSE_2.7' not found..."
07:52	<boeing>	to i386
07:52	<Mr>	ricree: oh, but I meant when will ubuntu send us the first updates for Heron, to fix some of the initial bugs?
07:52	<`mIRC`>	<ricree>	thanks mate ... :)
07:52	<chronographer>	mirc, you need to know what error number it is, 1.5 is the grub version I think.
07:52	<nikitis>	Ziroday, http://rafb.net/p/kKAg1C39.html  Here is my menu.lst entry
07:52	<seamus7>	AnRkey the alternate iso via bittorrent is only about 700MB
07:52	<Ziroday>	!grub | nikitis
07:52	<ubotu>	nikitis: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
07:52	<`mIRC`>	i just hope that they fix all that problems
07:52	<dystopianray>	Deathserver: openjdk should cause less problems overall with ubuntu, it is the new open source java
07:52	<ricree>	Mr: ah, missunderstood you.  I don't have any idea
07:52	<Ziroday>	nikitis: have a look at the links from ubotu
07:53	<Deathserver>	i created a sybolic link to a file in firefox plugins tring to install java manuly was that file already there
07:53	<`mIRC`>	<chronographer>	i already fomat ubuntu 7.10 ...and waiting to install 8.04 ... :)
07:53	<`mIRC`>	just hope that they fix all that problems
07:53	<pawbie>	yay, 8.04
07:53	<sticksabuser>	so I'm having issues enabling compiz on my friend's older laptop, which worked fine with 7.10, but know is just not working... any advice of what I need to look at to hopefully figure out the issue?
07:53	<pawbie>	What a terrible experience that was.
07:53	<advcomp2019>	i wonder if anyone has good luck with hardy with the rtl8187b wifi card.. i had issues with in the last few version of ubuntu
07:54	<artti>	Does 32-bit Ubuntu will with AMD64?
07:54	<sticksabuser>	*now
07:54	<`mIRC`>	in the end i knew problem of can't load NTFS .... the cause was windows was corrupt :(
07:54	<chronographer>	if you deleted a partition with 7.1 on it, grub wont find menu.lst file and wont work.
07:54	<NukeSkyjumper>	artti: yes
07:54	<Lardarse>	nickrud: i find it ironic that while xmms has been removed, the plugins haven't
07:54]  * jburd doesn't get an "upgrade dialog" when he inserts his ubuntu alternate disc
07:54	<chronographer>	lardares audacity is xmms
07:54	<Deathserver>	openjdk-6-jre that command is not found
07:54	<`mIRC`>	 <chronographer>	... i use fdisk /mbr
07:54	<lucasmk>	Lardarse, audacity is a better xmms
07:55	<Lardarse>	...
07:55	<tijn>	but i like xmms
07:55	<artti>	I don't know. Should i install 64-bit Ubuntu or 32-but Ubuntu.
07:55	<seamus7>	***jburd are you booting from the disc?
07:55	<DracoZA>	chronographer luckily I had a backup xorg.conf which I renamed and I can log in now
07:55	<chronographer>	great!
07:55	<boeing>	jburd, u are here?
07:55	<dystopianray>	artti: 32-bit
07:55	<tijn>	dont tell me its 'better'
07:55	<`mIRC`>	:)
07:55	<eugenebythesea>	hi - after installing ubuntu-restricted-extras, i tried playing some avi files in totem - and it says: "failed to connect stream: invalid argument" - could someone advise? i'm on 8.04
07:55	<chronographer>	bloody xorg, I cant get mine to work with nvidia drivers activated
07:55	<NukeSkyjumper>	artti: expect a slight performance boost in 64bit, but with more trouble getting nonfree stuff like adobe products to work
07:55	<Deathserver>	how do i write in read dyno
07:55	<chronographer>	it gives the wrong refresh rate...
07:55	<jburd>	seamus7: No.  I'm just using the disc to upgrade my existing installation from within it
07:55	<YAOMTC>	I'm currently downloading a bunch of apps, thus can't access the package manager to check, so... It's possible to downgrade Firefox to v2, right?
07:55	<jburd>	boeing: Yeah hi.
07:55	<Emof>	So I upgraded to hardy and now my nvidia drivers don't work anymore...
07:56	<AnRkey>	seamus7, thats about a week's worth of my bandwidth :D
07:56	<`mIRC`>	 <chronographer>	... what do u think if i report those errors i found to develpoper team?
07:56	<antibios>	hey guys, I've just fresh installed 8.04 on my laptop.  I'm trying to configure twinview on my nvidia card and I can't find any information on it.  Is there a tool to use which will configure the desktop for me? Or do I have to edit Xorg.conf manually?
07:56	<seamus7>	AnRkey: I understand
07:56	<chronographer>	what errors?
07:56	<jburd>	seamus7: Can one also upgrade by booting from the disc?
07:56	<boeing>	jburd, what i meant in yesterday's conversation is that take for instance our friend, fspot crashes
07:56	<seamus7>	jburd my understanding is that you would need to boot into the alternate CD before getting the upgrade message ... I think
07:56	<biabia>	ok i am slightly less than happy with the way my hardy upgrade went. did I do harm to keep my old "/boot/grub/menu.1st"
07:56	<`mIRC`>	<chronographer>	-- example....ubuntu can't load NTFS filesystem ... or else i found
07:56	<artti>	NukeSkyjumper, currenlty i have 32-bit Ubuntu on 64-bit and flash doesn't work.
07:56	<jburd>	I get the upgrade message on another machine just not this one
07:56	<Ziroday>	antibios: you can try the screen resolution utility or install the nvidia configuration app - sudo apt-get install nvidia-config
07:56	<Wavesonics>	ok. I got my ATI drivers working, but now my dual monitors wont work :( please help
=== pradalover is now known as pradalvr
07:56	<lunchbox330>	so i upgraded to hardy and turning on 3d windows crashes compiz now.
07:57	<AnRkey>	seamus7, our secondary operator is going to have it's international link by middle next year so there might be some hope for me yet :D
07:57	<NukeSkyjumper>	artti: if you're running 32bit ubuntu, it's not your cpu's fault

07:57	<lunchbox330>	yeah jburd alt disc will prompt for upgrade
07:57	<Deathserver>	dyno openjdk-6-jre didnt work the command dose not exist
07:57	<syrus>	i think ill wait to upgrade :)
07:57	<Ziroday>	antibios: gimme a sec
07:57	<boeing>	jburd, in that case the "safe/silent" distros are capable of terminating X and we dont need to reboot
07:57	<jburd>	lunchbox330: when I boot from it?
07:57	<Koheleth>	Guys can I install the 32 bit version over the 64 bit I installed, I am having problems with popular programs all the time
07:57	<boeing>	jburd, the keyboard continues to work
07:57	<CommanderCool>	since i have hardy heron i get an error when trying to mount a ntfs drive...can anyone help me? "...version `FUSE_2.7' not found..."

07:58	<ferris_>	hello, so after i upgraded to 8.04 I no longer have wifi... that kind of sucks
07:58	<dystopianray>	Koheleth: you'll have to do a reinstall
07:58	<XceII>	antibios: nvidia settings plugin

07:58	<reeeh2000>	Woot! Hardy Rocks! Good Job
07:58	<Yodude>	NukeSkyjumper: i know but sadly i hardy know many of them
07:58	<eugenebythesea>	anyone familiar with this error from totem: "failed to connect stream: invalid argument"?
07:58	<Koheleth>	ok, will it do all the formating itself etc
07:58	<jburd>	lunchbox330: yeah but that doesn't happen on the computer I'm using.  if I'm already running ubuntu and I insert it on another machine, it does show me an upgrade dialog
07:58	<CommanderCool>	pawbie: it is, it even worked before
07:58	<`mIRC`>	i found some idiot said....he can hacked 127.0.0.1
07:58	<advcomp2019>	ferris_, what wifi card is it?
07:58	<Yodude>	NukeSkyjumper: what do you think i should do to fix it ?

08:00	<Wavesonics>	can anyone here help me get dual monitors working w\ my ATI card?
08:00	<reeeh2000>	hey, are the servers just swamped right now b/c of Hardy's release?  I'm getting really slow speeds on package downloads rightnow
08:00	<antibios>	﻿Ziroday: thanks dude... the screen resolution only detects the built in screen.  The nvidia-settings worked a treat.  Thank you very much!
08:00	<nikitis>	Ziroday, that grub info doesn't help me
08:00	<Ziroday>	antibios: no problem, had the same issues myself
08:00	<AnRkey>	seamus7, i can go bigger then it's twice the price
08:00	<dystopianray>	reeeh2000: they are being used heavily so expect them to be slow
08:00	<jburd>	boeing: do you have a broadcom card by any chance?
08:01	<nikitis>	Ziroday, in my case, grub is booting, but does not point correctly to the windows partition or maybe it does, but needs some other command to boot it.
08:01	<biabia>	did i screw up keeping my old 'menu.1st' when i upgrades to hardy
08:01	<jburd>	those are the most stupid pieces of sh*t I've had to deal with
08:01	<Deathserver>	none of the commands to get java have worked
08:01	<Ziroday>	nikitis: eh?, I thought those links had a method to reconfigure grub and therefore rescan for other OS's
08:01	<prodigel>	Hi. I've just uninstalled all that's linked with gnome in a attempt to reinstall it(due to frequent crashes). How can I install it back?
08:01	<AnRkey>	seamus7, this line costs me about $50 USD
08:01	<reeeh2000>	Dystopianray: Yeah, thats what I figured, I guess in a way its good.  Lots of people using ubuntu
08:01	<dystopianray>	reeeh2000: you can always use a different mirror
08:01	<reeeh2000>	true
08:02	<seamus7>	AnRkey: you pay that much for so little!
08:02	<Deathserver>	is there a way i can back up my wifi drivers and easil install them on the new release
08:02	<AnRkey>	seamus7, yes, sadly so
08:02	<spider_>	hi, is there any way to ask the system to reload my .bashrc without logging off from the system or wihtout closing the console i am working right at this moment?
08:02	<Hans>	Okay, i wait for the fix for sound and my laptop will play all nessesary sounds (for presentation etc.)
08:02	<arj>	spider_: .
08:02	<Yodude>	hans: i have the sound nightmare too
08:03	<jburd>	bleh upgrades have never worked for me
08:03	<Hans>	Welcome to the club! ;-)
08:03	<jburd>	and they never will I suppose
08:03	<advcomp2019>	I have the realtek rtl8187b wifi card and i just wonder if hardy works better with that card before i upgrade it because the last few versions had big issues so i hope it works better
08:03	<jburd>	and I can't keep doing clean installs all the time on multiple machines
08:03	<AnRkey>	seamus7, if i want more data once i am capped i have to pay another $30 USD for another 3gb
08:03	<spider_>	arj:  i tried it like this ". .bashrc" but it doesnt seems like it reloaded my .bashrc
08:03	<Deathserver>	whats new in the new rlease and should i change
08:03	<artti>	Downloading .iso file is slow.
08:03	<up365>	successful upgrade on 1 box, lost nvidia display settings until I installed nvidia X server settings and other than loss of google toolbar-not compatible with Firefox3,beta5 everything is good
08:04	<ferris_>	yeah, if i can get my wifi hardy will be worth keeping
08:04	<icesword>	Deathserver, http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/804features/
08:04	<jburd>	upgrading from the cd NEVER works.
08:04	<jawnv6>	I have the live cd running, I know i have two hdd's in the system, one formatted, one not, how do I format the blank one?
08:04	<Yodude>	hey i got sound working !!!! but with alsa not pulseaudo, the problem must have been pulseaudio
08:04	<neeto>	Is there anyone in here that lost their 3d-windows/wallpaper plugin compatibility on compiz with their upgrade? Does anyone have a workaround?
08:04	<gharz>	dystopianray: i checked my synaptic and openoffice.org-java-common is already installed.
08:04	<biabia>	none of my firefox extensions were compatible
08:04	<Yodude>	maybe pulseaudio doesn't support all kinds of soundcards ?
08:04	<Deathserver>	thanks, still need help with getting java installed
08:05	<biabia>	i wish the upgrade gave the option of upgrading firefox
08:05	<biabia>	i woulda said no
08:05	<dystopianray>	gharz: in openoffie's configuration have you set a jre for it to use?
08:06	<neeto>	biabia: try the MR Tech Local Install plugin, you can disable compatibility checks, and then you can use your non-compatible plugins (no guarantees on how they will work though)
08:06	<Moc>	Can't get Both Screen to work !!
08:06	<gord>	jburd: dont BOTT the alternate to use as upgrade, just insert it into a ruinning system, then u get dialog box asking if u want packages upgraded (it auto-recognises u see)
08:06	<gord>	boot''
08:06	<jburd>	gord: even that fails.
08:06	<biabia>	neeto ok thanks ill check that out.
08:07	<Jordan_U>	Moc, What version of Ubuntu are you using?
08:07	<gord>	jburd: hmm
08:07	<jburd>	cannot resolve "xxxxxx" packages at this time.  please try later.
08:07	<AnRkey>	i have removed tracker and tracker-applet
08:07	<GIn>	I have no sound with my media players when firefox is playing a flash movie. why?
08:07	<jburd>	that is not a message an end user would like to see.
08:07	<AnRkey>	but my drive keeps trashing
08:07	<AnRkey>	how can i turn indexing off?
08:07	<gharz>	dystopianray: yes... under Tools->Options->OpenOffice.Org->Java ... have 3 java avail... 2 from Sun and 1 from Free Software Foundation... i ticked the radio button Sun Micro Inc. 1.6.0
08:07	<Moc>	8.04
08:07	<jburd>	that happens when you choose not to use the network
08:07	<boeing>	jburd, i have a via card.
08:07	<dystopianray>	gharz: what does it say when you run: java -version ?
08:07	<Moc>	worked fine in 6.10 with nvidia firmware
08:07	<gharz>	dystopianray: i've rebooted my machine... logged out .. .restarted OO...
08:07	<tparcina>	hi channel!
08:08	<Acoustyk>	hi thar!
=== Jwyanz1 is now known as Jwyanze
08:08	<biabia>	I get an error now:  Error "vm.mmap_ap_min_addr is an unknown key"      fail    when my system does the checks on boot
08:08	<tparcina>	where can I find Ubuntu 8.04 i386 MD5SUM?
08:08	<reeeh2000>	Hey, which is the best plugin for flash on firefox?
08:08	<dystopianray>	reeeh2000: flashplugin-nonfree
08:08	<GIn>	flash on linux is crap :(
08:08	<dny>	err
08:08	<dny>	my sound keeps going out :/
08:09	<boeing>	reeeh2000, dint you get the popup when flash loaded first time to install flash?
08:09	<gord>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/MD5SUMS
08:09	<jburd>	and why the heck does an upgrade restart have to fetch all the necessary files *again* from the internet?
08:09	<boeing>	the package which installs works perfect.
08:09	<Jordan_U>	GIn, Hardy uses PulseAudio by default but Adobe's flash plugin doesn't play well with pulseaudio, if you want to solve the problem of not being able to use flash and other things at once install libflashsupport but that may lead lash to be less stable
08:09	<reeeh2000>	boing: i did, it list several choices
08:09	<gharz>	dystopianray: java version "1.6.0_06 Java (TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_6-b02)
08:09	<Deathserver>	if i check the java version with java -version it says its the latest build but if i go to browser and enter about:plugins it isnt listed
08:09	<boeing>	jburd, i recommended u not to use that *upgrade* option.
08:09	<reeeh2000>	boeing: iv had problems on 7.10 with opening to full screen
08:10	<dny>	is there a command to restart alsa?
08:10	<jburd>	boeing: I have so many machines here.  I'm not crazy to do claen installs on all of them.
08:10	<GIn>	Jordan_U: is libflashsupport the free flash alternative?
08:10	<tparcina>	gord: I can't open that web page - time out :(
08:10	<boeing>	reeeh2000, use the adobe-flash plugin
08:10	<jburd>	upgrades networkless or networked should be PAINLESS not PAINFUL.
08:10	<Jordan_U>	GIn, No, it's a pulseaudio plugin specifically for nonfree flash
08:10	<reeeh2000>	boeing: ok, i just hate using adobes stuff is all, thabks
08:10	<boeing>	boeing, get the cd and insert. then upgrade feasibility will be listed immediately
08:10	<neeto>	firefox keeps dying on me even though it thinks that all my plugins are compatible
08:10	<neeto>	what gives
08:10	<jeanre>	anyone here run compiz fusion?
08:11	<Jordan_U>	Moc, How did you install the nvidia drivers?
08:11	<boeing>	jburd, , get the cd and insert. then upgrade feasibility will be listed immediately
08:11	<Jordan_U>	!anyone | jeanre
08:11	<ubotu>	jeanre: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
08:11	<neeto>	jeanre: yeah, I've been having problems since my 8.04 upgrade...
08:11	<GIn>	Jordan_U: but Pulseaudio is not in a stable state itself :(
08:11	<jburd>	boeing: I'm talking about that very same thing.  it rarely works.
08:11	<cham_eleon>	any ideas why my ide hdd isn't recognized by the hardy kernel? my sata devices are working.
08:11	<tparcina>	ubuntu 8.04 i386 MD5SUM, where can I get it? http://releases.ubuntu.com times out for me :(
08:11	<`mIRC`>	what is the different btw KDE and GNOME?
08:11	<Deathserver>	how can i test my java
08:11	<GIn>	wonder why ubuntu included such an important piece of software in beta state in the OS
08:11	<jburd>	ubuntu should start paying attention to the installation process more than adding tons of new features.  make that robust first.
08:11	<Jordan_U>	GIn, Pulseaudio is stable, it's just that the pulseaudio plugin for flash can cause flash to crash
08:11	<boeing>	jburd, remove all internet links in /etc/apt(?)
08:11	<nick_>	whats a good burning program
08:11	<jawnv6>	how do I get a list of the different SDA devices attached?
08:12	<Deathserver>	terminal says it is there but i doubt it
08:12	<boeing>	nick_, k3b
08:12	<DJones>	nick_: k3b or gnomebaker are normally pretty good
08:12	<neeto>	`mIRC`: In my humble opninion KDE is an ugly piece of crap that looks like a bargain bin windows knock off, and gnome is an original and beautiful piece of interface glory... but that's just me
08:12	<Moc>	Jordan_U: the one what is provided by ubuntu, I installed it once manually with partial result (Main screen blinked) but after a reboot, xorg bumped it to vesa
08:12	<jeanre>	neeto: I have n o themes in the emerald manager
08:12	<boeing>	nick_, the default gnome creator has *burnt* my cd
08:12	<jburd>	boeing: that's not my idea of painless
08:12	<neeto>	jeanre: did you used to?
08:12	<dny>	is there a command to restart alsa?
08:12	<eugenebythesea>	um, does anyone have any issues playing video in totem? i can play flash, music etc, but no video. get this error: "failed to connect stream: invalid argument"
08:13	<jawnv6>	formata sata ubuntu
08:13	<Moc>	installing nvidia-setting rightnow from repo, will see if it work
08:13	<tparcina>	come on guys, someone must have MD5SUM of ubuntu 8.04 i386
08:13	<Jordan_U>	Moc, Installing it manually may have broken the packaged drivers
08:13	<jawnv6>	:( wrong keyboard
08:13	<`mIRC`>	neeto: so means you prefer pure ubuntu rather than kubuntu?
08:13	<please>	hi
08:13	<Moc>	Jordan_U: It why I reinstalled it complely, fresh install
08:13	<please>	anyone here to help
08:13	<jeanre>	neeto: no this a is a new install
08:13	<please>	really need help
08:13	<DJones>	!ask | please
08:13	<ubotu>	please: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)

08:14	<please>	and then eventually the machine hanged

08:14	<boeing>	sorry
08:14	<tparcina>	Jordan_U: can't open that page - time out :(
08:14	<please>	i pushed the power button
08:14	<jburd>	lol
08:14	<please>	and restart

08:15	<please>	something like this
08:15	<jburd>	I think I'll better get the dvd instead
08:15	<gord>	Jordan_U: was getting endless timouts on the web page so i posted, baybe someone could pling-bot it?
08:15	<Jordan_U>	Wavesonics, They come installed by default, to use them change the driver from "fglrx" to "ati"
08:15	<gharz>	dystopianray: any idea what's causing this error?
08:15	<gord>	maybe'
08:15	<boeing>	jburd, are dvd s out as yet?
08:15	<dystopianray>	gharz: no, sorry
08:15	<Deiz>	So, as with every time I install Ubuntu, windows maximize to both my monitors instead of one. Is there a workaround? I recall with 7.04 I got lucky after a reboot and it started working properly.
08:15	<gharz>	dystopianray: thanks!
08:15	<jburd>	boeing: yeah sure I have the torrents
08:15	<Deathserver>	i install java 6 through the missing plugin popup the go to java install and it says OOPS yo dont have the <RECOMENDED>	version installed is it a big deal?
08:15	<Moc>	rebooting and will see if it work fine this time

08:15	<Wavesonics>	Jordan_U: do they enable 3d acceleration?
08:15	<boeing>	jburd, can u send the x86_64 as file?
08:16	<ferris_>	please, which version?
08:16	<please>	Error 16 inconsistent ...... tried everything
08:16	<jburd>	boeing: sure
08:16	<please>	8.04
08:16	<biabia>	Hardy upgrade resulted in an error now on boot:  Error "vm.mmap_ap_min_addr is an unknown key"      fail     --any idea how to fix?
08:16	<Yodude>	hey i have a sound FIX EVERYONE !
08:16	<neeto>	Yodude: what's that?
08:16	<boeing>	please, reinstall for now. it would be painless
08:16	<please>	and i just used live cd to come to ubuntu and chat and get help
08:16	<Jordan_U>	Wavesonics, Unless you have an old card you are more likely to get 3D acceleration from the proprietary drivers ( unfortunately )
08:16	<please>	how about my setting
08:16	<please>	my files
08:16	<please>	?
08:16	<Yodude>	evryone go into the multimedia systems selector and select alsa and the proper cards, and go into the sound setting (Ssystem-pref-sound) and select the card itself for sound
08:16	<ferris_>	please, you probably want to reinstall
08:17	<Yodude>	but honestly people PulseAudio is CRAP
08:17	<Wavesonics>	Jordan_U: but the damn proprietary ones don't work with the nice GUI resoltuon tool lol
08:17	<boeing>	jburd, thank u
08:17	<please>	so no one has experienced this error before ?
08:17	<ferris_>	please, it will be much less stressful than trying to fix your existing problems
08:17	<jburd>	boeing: sure
08:17	<please>	is it
08:18	<please>	so i have to reinstall ubuntu every 2-3 days right ?
08:18	<ferris_>	powering off is not a good idea
08:18	<please>	cause i just installed it yesterday
08:18	<boeing>	please, no.
08:18	<please>	and one more thing which may help
08:18	<please>	the partition is FAT
08:19	<boeing>	please, just ensure that u install motherboard drivers before installing the final system. so as a newbie you will face less pain
08:19	<please>	the recovery is not working as well
08:19	<boeing>	please, ah!
08:19	<boeing>	please, fat is a doomed fs.
08:19	<raj1>	ok how do i know iam on final hardy
08:19	<Deathserver>	i guess my java is fine java game is playing
08:19	<please>	ok so tell me please what to do
08:19	<raj1>	grub says development
08:19	<please>	step by step
08:19	<please>	so FAT is not good
08:19	<Kirby>	Is there a firewall in Kubuntu?
08:19	<boeing>	please, u could have selected the default ext3 during installation
08:19	<ferris_>	please, go with ext3
08:20	<please>	ok
08:20	<jburd>	I have one question
08:20	<Kr0ntab>	!ufw | Kirby
08:20	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ufw - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
08:20	<Kr0ntab>	doh
08:20	<please>	cause i just installed it from windows
08:20	<jburd>	can I pop in the desktop cd and then boot with it to upgrade with it?
08:20	<jburd>	without deleting my home directory
08:20	<please>	what did you mean by motherboard driver
08:20	<please>	there is no driver
08:20	<please>	i just downloaded ubuntu and it says the drivers are included
08:20	<Flannel>	jburd: If you have home on a separate partition, yes.  Otherwise no, the Desktop CD can only be used to install, not upgrade.
08:20	<boeing>	so please has shown how wulluby(am i right with the name?) can go wrong in certain circumstances
08:21	<raj1>	there is no such thing as motherboard drivers in ubuntu
=== _nano_ is now known as _nano
08:21	<boeing>	fat is a bad thing.
08:21	<raj1>	?
08:21	<Kr0ntab>	Kirby: see ufw....  included by default... very simple to enable basic firewall.
08:21	<gord>	boing: wubi
08:21	<Kr0ntab>	Heya Flannel ... how ya doin man
08:21	<Daisuke_Ido>	boeing, wubi, and it would be a shorter list if we listed ways it couldn't go wrong
=== _nano is now known as _nano_
08:21	<boeing>	raj1, i mean motherboard-based drivers. eg. proprietry gphx drivers(if any), etc.
08:21	<Kirby>	Kr0ntab: can I use 'learning mode' in it so that it doesn't allow any connections
08:21	<raj1>	oh ok
08:22	<raj1>	mmm like nvidia nforce
08:22	<Daisuke_Ido>	that is purely opinion though,
08:22	<nikitis>	I still need help with mapping my windows bootloader in grub.  I keep getting an error 13: invalid or unsupported executable format error
08:22	<biabia>	when i upgraded I didnt upgrade my menu.1st i kept the old one. is there a way I can upgrade just that file now? or could someone pastebin it from the new hardy, unmodified
08:22	<kindofabuzz>	will someone DCC the i386 alt torrent to me?
=== dny_ is now known as dny
08:22	<boeing>	Daisuke_Ido, that should be listed to M$ as fat is their baby and it does nt have journaling, which would actually have saved please
08:22	<Flannel>	biabia: `sudo update-grub` ought to do it
08:22	<Kr0ntab>	ufw by default blocks all inbound ... and you have the ability to add rules as you see fit...
08:22	<please>	for the last time i say this and if no one can help im going to reinstall ubuntu
08:23	<jburd>	kindofabuzz: there

08:24	<Deathserver>	any help on updateing menu's
08:24	<boeing>	the main problem is that wubi is interfering with an another os's partition without changing its structure.
08:25	<please>	and restareted and couldnt get to to ubuntu

08:28	<Flannel>	lekro: just regular updates.
08:29	<evand>	boeing: he cannot get into Windows?  I missed that part.
08:29	<boeing>	yes
08:29	<Jordan_U>	boeing, He is only unable to boot Ubuntu
08:29	<Ziroday>	dubby: yes, use the torrents
08:29	<nikitis>	Flannel: from grub that is
08:29	<icesword>	iusegnulinux, lucida fonts? --------->google
08:29	<lekro>	Ziroday: oh, sorry
08:29	<Emof>	I upgraded to Hardy and now suddenly my nvidia drivers don't work anymore. Anyone knows how to fix this?
08:29	<lekro>	thanks
08:29	<linxuz3r>	hey how do i enable direct rendering in hardy heron
08:29	<iusegnulinux>	luxi fonts
08:29	<Flannel>	nikitis: Try going in ad changing it from root [whatever] to rootnoverify [whatever] for your windows option
08:29	<Daisuke_Ido>	Emof, reinstall from the repos
08:29	<Wavesonics>	I had dual monitors working with the default ATI drivers, then I couldnt do 3D desktop, so i installed the proprietary drivers, then I couldnt do dual monitor, so i went back to the default drivers, and now nothing works.
08:29	<Jordan_U>	Emof, How did you install them?
08:29	<icesword>	!find luxi fonts
08:29	<raj1>	nikitis:try recovery mode?
08:29	<ubotu>	No packages matching 'luxi' could be found
08:30	<Emof>	I've tried uninstalling and installing again with envy, but that didn't work
08:30	<Ziroday>	!envy | Emof
08:30	<ubotu>	Emof: envy is an unsupported tool to install newer versions of binary video drivers than provided by the official repositories. Use at your own risk, and remember that the latest version is not necessarily the "best". See « /msg ubotu binarydriver »
08:30	<nikitis>	Flannel: I still get an error 13
08:30	<Jordan_U>	Wavesonics, I believe you have to actually remove fglrx ( the proprietary drivers ) because they are evil and mess up the open source ones
08:30	<iusegnulinux>	boot to ubuntu and repair grub
08:30	<Emof>	yeah, but I've tried with the normal drivers too
08:30	<Emof>	didn't work either
08:30	<ilMacchia>	hello
08:30	<nikitis>	raj1: no not sure how
08:31	<latitu>	i have hp deskjet 3900 printer. how can i see ink levels and have some advanced configs and printing quality levels . like in windows?
08:31	<Flannel>	nikitis: alright, pastebin your menu.lst, and the output of fdisk -l (that's an L), and I'll take a look.
08:31	<boeing>	please, remove ubuntu from windows first.
08:31	<nikitis>	I have 3 harddrives, with windows being on hd2,0
08:31	<marvxxx>	i do a upgrade with the ubuntu alternate cd...still it wants to download 400 packages :(
08:31	<raj1>	from grub menu
08:31	<iusegnulinux>	may be your windows partition is not the active partition anymore
08:31	<raj1>	ok can someone tell me about pastebin
08:32	<Flannel>	!paste | raj1
08:32	<ubotu>	raj1: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
08:32	<nikitis>	Flannel: ok, give me a moment to boot it up
08:32	<mosno>	marvxxx, all the new versions of the extra software you installed!
08:32	<jeanre>	where does one get emerald themes?
08:32	<marvxxx>	mosno: makes sense
08:32	<Wavesonics>	Jordan_U, I searched for fglrx in synaptic, and i dont see which i should remove
08:33	<latitu>	i have hp deskjet 3900 printer. how can i see ink levels and have some advanced configs and printing quality levels . like in windows?
08:33	<marvxxx>	im just behind a slow connection
08:33	<foraoh>	hi, does anyone know a good theme for firefox beta 3?
08:33	<marvxxx>	thats the only problem
08:33	<Zloog>	Hi, did something change in 8.04 to make it so that my samba share settings arent saved in /etc/samba/smb.conf anymore? The shares are working fine, but I dont see the share settings in the smb.conf file anymore.
08:33	<iusegnulinux>	tango
08:33	<hugol1>	any one know how to solve the problems with the nvidia propietary drivers?
08:33	<Jordan_U>	Wanderer, xorg-driver-fglrx I believe
08:33	<raj1>	like this __http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64324/
08:33	<raj1>	huh
08:33	<iusegnulinux>	what problem?
08:33	<Ziroday>	hugol1: what are these problems exactly
08:34	<kuru>	I like GNOME on ubuntu, but how do I get rid of the annoying way it alternates between apps (alt-tab) ...
08:34	<Johnny_>	hey
08:34	<iusegnulinux>	i use nvidia proprietary driver
08:34	<kuru>	it keeps showing icons of the running apps and a bit of animation
08:34	<darryl>	how do you use the 32bit libraries for compiling?
08:34	<kuru>	which, if anything, is just plain annoying
08:34	<xepra>	man ubuntu's grub install is fubar
08:34	<kuru>	can't figure out how to get rid of it
08:34	<Johnny_>	I have downloaded a .tar.gz file but do not know how to install it. how can i do so?
08:34	<xepra>	I haven't gotten it to work out of the box once
08:34	<latitu>	i have hp deskjet 3900 printer. how can i see ink levels and have some advanced configs and printing quality levels . like in windows?
08:34	<Ziroday>	kuru: what do you want to change it to?
08:34	<Qrawl>	is ther a virtualization thing built in to Hoary
08:34	<raj1>	double click
08:34	<raj1>	:)
08:34	<Flannel>	Qrawl: Hoary?
08:34	<darryl>	Johnny_: you have to extract the files and probably compile the program
08:34	<Wavesonics>	Jordan_U: I don't have that installed it says
08:34	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, Are you sure it's not available in the repos or as a .deb file?
08:34	<XceII>	lol hoary
08:35	<hugol1>	Ziroday:  launchpad is full of it. Since I installed hardy I cant install nvidia propietary drivers. Neither through Hardware drivers neither manually
08:35	<bobbie4>	well, it's time for bobbie to go to bed, night all!!!!
08:35	<Qrawl>	I mean Hardy
08:35	<hugol1>	and the max resolution I get is 800x600
08:35	<Hans>	I know a guy, who uses still Breezy Badger...
08:35	<Johnny_>	darryl: how do i compile it
08:35	<XceII>	heron
08:35	<`mIRC`>	what is the most suitable filesystem (ext1...ext2...ext3) to use for install ubuntu?
08:35	<tomasko>	wow there are so many trolls here tonight. more so than normal
08:35	<tomasko>	can't separate the noobs from the trolls either
08:35	<boeing>	Johnny_, extract the archive
08:35	<Zloog>	mIRC: ext3 is probably your best bet
08:35	<nikitis>	Flannel: http://rafb.net/p/xR4JIF23.html
08:35	<xepra>	or xfs...
08:35	<Ziroday>	hugol1: don't know anything about that sorry, proprietary drivers work fine for me
08:35	<Hans>	He asked on wednesday, why he dont get any update anymore....
08:35	<Johnny_>	boeing: i extracted how do i compile it
08:35	<tomasko>	`mIRC`: ext2 for the kernel /boot and ext3 for any data you care about (like your home dir, etc.)
08:35	<darryl>	Johnny_: that depends on the program, normally it would be  sudo ./configure && make && make install
08:36	<`mIRC`>	Zloog : excuse me....why is that so?
08:36	<boeing>	then go to a directory where u can find a file "configure"
08:36	<gnuskool>	screen resolution on an external monitor for laptops is a nightmare, help, i got intel 855 card
08:36	<kuru>	ziroday, to just switch to the other app
08:36	<iusegnulinux>	tried the binary installer?
08:36	<tomasko>	`mIRC`: no one uses ext1
08:36	<hugol1>	Ziroday:  ok
08:36	<Johnny_>	darryl: where do i even type this in
08:36	<Ziroday>	kuru: eh?
08:36	<iusegnulinux>	ext3 is cool
08:36	<boeing>	Johnny_, open a terminal and cd to that folder
08:36	<boeing>	./configure
08:36	<Johnny_>	boeing: what does cd mean
08:36	<kuru>	ziroday, no animation
08:36	<xepra>	'mIRC': ext3 is the slowest, but has the best failure recovery
08:36	<Flannel>	nikitis: and rootnoverify gives the same error?
08:36	<raj1>	change directory
08:36	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, Are you sure it's not available in the repos or as a .deb file?
08:36	<iusegnulinux>	change irectory
08:36	<boeing>	Johnny_, cd means change directory
08:37	<xepra>	'mIRC': jfs has the lowest cpu usage
08:37	<corbett>	hi, is there anyone who can help me get my maxtor external hard drive mounted and working on ububtu 7.10 - which ive just loaded on pc to replace windows, it worked perfectly fine elsewhere on widows, I think I need to run some checks as I dont know why it wont mount
08:37	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes it does
08:37	<Johnny_>	jordan: i am sure
08:37	<iusegnulinux>	reiserfs?
08:37	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, What are you trying to install?
08:37	<Johnny_>	jordan: apache
=== mbah is now known as iwan
08:37	<nikitis>	Flannel: i assume you mean change root  (hd2,0) to rootnoverify  (hd2,0)
08:37	<Flannel>	nikitis: Have you tried adding 'makeactive' after the root line?
08:37	<`mIRC`>	thanx you guyz for advice :D
08:37	<Flannel>	nikitis: I do.
08:37	<Qrawl>	so about my question, does Hardy have builtin virtualization
08:37	<Zloog>	mIRC: Your filesystem type usually doesnt matter too much. The only important thing is that it is journalizing, which ext3 is. Barring that, you don't need anything fancy unless you have a very particular need.
08:37	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
08:37	<Johnny_>	jordan: i have extracted to the desktop can u tell me exactly what 2 type in the terminal
08:37	<unop>	darryl, sudo ./configure && make && make install  probably wouldn't cut it ..  ./configure and make do not need to be run as root, make install does tho
08:37	<mcp_>	How do i disable Tracker? I already removed the Session-Entries. Trackerd still starts from time to time.
08:37	<gnuskool>	corbett: is it ntfs filesystem or linux filesystem
08:37	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes i believe so, i'll try again
08:37	<xepra>	'mIRC': they all have their advantages and disadvantages - there are some great benchmarks out there tho
08:37	<darryl>	hey does anyone know if you can compile lmms with vst support on a amd64?
08:38	<corbett>	gnuskool: ntfs
08:38	<boeing>	unop, he is new. he wont understand this lang.
08:38	<zigford>	extra chees
08:38	<boeing>	Johnny_, open a terminal
08:38	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, It depends on what program you are installing, you may need to get dependencies for that specific program
08:38	<Zloog>	corbett: How did you try mounting it?
08:38	<darryl>	i've tried but it says my libstc++ is imcompatible, i think it has to do with it being 64bit, but how do you get it to use the 32bit libraries?
08:38	<iusegnulinux>	how to get write permission to ntfs partition?
08:38	<`mIRC`>	thanx you guyz for advice :D
08:38	<Zloog>	^_^
08:38	<Johnny_>	jordan_U: it is appache and i have opened the terminal what do i type
=== rezx is now known as ixxa
08:39	<boeing>	Johnny_, type cd "/home/jo/directory"
08:39	<backslash>	Is there something really new in Hardy? Had no time to upgrade yet
08:39	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes same error, with makeactive under root or rootnoverify
08:39	<boeing>	Johnny_, this will change the dir of the terminal
08:39	<iusegnulinux>	latest apps
08:39	<nikitis>	Flannel: you can see why i'm confused
08:39	<Oprtz>	hello just install ubuntu 8.04 LTS and i love it, because it support my Intel 946GZ chipset and vga driver :) just want to ask how to minimize the screen resoultion, when ubuntu ask user name and password? after that i set my resoultion and ubuntu shift to that resoultion, thanks
08:39	<generic>	nay one works on gosa?
08:39	<boeing>	Johnny_, you have to hence change to the dir where a file called configure is located.
08:39	<XceII>	backslash:  it now has a kitchen sink
08:39	<corbett>	Zloog:   well ive just plugged it in, ive tried a mount command, but as im new , im not sure, ive only just loaded ubuntu
08:39	<boeing>	Johnny_, then type ./configure
08:39	<unop>	iusegnulinux, it should be as straight forward as a simple mount, what happens when you try and write to the partition?
08:40	<Johnny_>	boeing: i dont know what to type at all the file name is apache_1.3.4.1 and it is on the desktop can u put exactly what to type in quotes
08:40	<Xperiment62>	anyone here able to help me find a suitable IRC client, query if able to help
08:40	<Zloog>	Corbett: cool, If you go to your PLACES menu in X windows and then down to computer, you should see your drive listed in there
08:40	<boeing>	Johnny_, this means "execute configure", in the current directory, in unix
08:40	<karbo>	Anyone else experienced this? I have managed to configure my ATI card to use dual screen, 2 desktops next to eachother, and this works fine on the login display. But as soon as I log in, it resets to cloned display.
08:40	<lalalala>	why is ubuntu so great?????????
=== deadly is now known as cako
08:40	<Zloog>	corbett: double click that and it should mount
08:40	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
08:40	<Johnny_>	boeing i am to confused
08:40	<iusegnulinux>	i can mount it, read it, but cant write
08:40	<boeing>	Johnny_, apache is easier to install.
08:41	<boeing>	u dont need to compile from source.
08:41	<Xperiment62>	anyone here able to help me find a suitable IRC client, query if able to help
08:41	<Johnny_>	boeing_i am trying to install apache
08:41	<unop>	iusegnulinux, yes, we gathered that much -- but what exactly happens when you try and write to it?
08:41	<Hikejinx>	I'm running Hardy on VirtualBox. Does anyone know of any tricks to get the restricted drivers to work on there? I can just install them in the cli I guess?
08:41	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, "sudo apt-get build-dep apache2" what is wrong with Ubuntu's version though?
08:41	<Zloog>	Did something change in 8.04 to make it so that my samba share settings arent saved in /etc/samba/smb.conf anymore? The shares are working fine, but I dont see the share settings in the smb.conf file anymore.
08:41	<Flannel>	Xperiment62: Xchat, irssi, Konversation

08:42	<boeing>	Johnny_, go to system-->administration-->synaptic
08:42	<WelshDragon>	Xperiment62, If you know perl, python, or TCL, xchat would be your best bet :)

08:44	<Zloog>	Corbett: what do you mean by you "wiped" windows? If you've deleted that partition, then the data is lost forver :(
08:45	<Flannel>	nikitis: Try (and yes, this is complete shotgun debugging) moving the root line to after the mapping (but keep it 2,0)
08:45	<unop>	kahrytan, errm, the only fonts that resemble microsofts truetype fonts are microsoft's themselves, i know of no other

08:46	<unop>	:)
08:46	<boeing>	Johnny_, apache involves certain configurations other than just installations. installing thru synaptic makes it easier. installing thru make and make install involves post-configuration of certain textfiles

09:05	<lalalala>	why use ubuntu its so complicated! vista is so easy click click click and its more stable/secure than ubuntu!
09:05	<macouno>	IndyGunFreak, cause wubi in included, which means it's easier for windows users to try out ubuntu... which is good, but ehm.. if the website doesn't work for them at all... they just won't bother
09:05	<boeing>	lalalala, #ubuntu-offtopic
09:05	<pengo>	Light-: well not so weird. i had the same problem in gutsy. (this is a clean install)

09:06	<IndyGunFreak>	macouno: well, i imagine the website works.... why wouldn't it.
09:06	<Maxdamantus>	grimsqueaker13, just edit it, and add some programs to run when you start the VNC.

09:06	<Light->	pengo: ah, ok
09:06	<Maxdamantus>	You'd probably want to add "metacity&", "xterm"
09:06	<corbett>	gnuskool: 260 MB is a thunb drive istick in to see if the reaer usb is working, the maxtro is 100 GB
09:06	<ikonia>	OsamaK: sure
09:06	<macouno>	IndyGunFreak, well... it doesn't... I found at least half a dozen issues wihtin 5 minutes of browsing

09:07	<macouno>	IndyGunFreak, issues like not being able to go beyond the first item in the dropdown menu (and on some pages no dropdown menu showing at all)...
09:07	<ikonia>	mintsoup: look in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
09:07	<ikonia>	mintsoup: look at the Driver section
09:07	<IndyGunFreak>	macouno: well who's to say thast Ubuntu's fault?  IE isn't exactly known for blazing speed and stability... I'd say if most people are looking at Free Alternatives, good possibility they are already using Opera or Firefox
09:07	<ikonia>	mintsoup: unless.... what version of ubuntu are you using ?
09:07	<mintsoup>	ah yes shoulda thought of that ;p  Thanks
09:07	<pengo>	Light-: yep. manual mounting works
09:08	<Light->	pengo: weird that automounting doesnt

09:08	<joetheodd>	Floodbot2, hi.
09:08	<boeing>	Light-, add /dev/sdb1 in /etc/fstab with right parameters if u want regularly
09:09	<macouno>	IndyGunFreak, I'ts not a matter of "fault"... it should be "made to work", having a website that doesn't work in the big 3 browsers is just not a good idea
09:09	<Light->	boeing: pengo is having the problem not me :)
09:09	<genie>	I cannot switch between keyboard layout when I press both ALT together ! any idea?
09:09	<boeing>	pengo,  add /dev/sdb1 in /etc/fstab with right parameters if u want regularly
09:09	<OsamaK>	ikonia: Great. I'm using Ubuntu + Ubuntu-KDE4, but I wasn't very sure of other versions like ED, X..
09:09	<macouno>	IndyGunFreak, anyway... I just thought I'd mention it in case one of the webdevs was in here
09:09	<mintsoup>	question: is it a bad idea to comment out a line in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer?
09:09	<boeing>	OsamaK, install one *ubuntu and insert the other cds. the package manager will automatically detect and u can add the other cds as offline repos
09:09	<IndyGunFreak>	macouno: well, write canonical, i'm sure they'd just love to hear about it.

09:10	<pengo>	boeing: thanks.. but would be nice to have a generic solution
09:10	<iGraphiX>	csais, why do you need aMSN, you have Pidgin installed by default.
09:10	<OsamaK>	ikonia: thaks
09:10	<wilsud>	#eeepc
09:10	<Qrawl>	Can someone help me. Im really confused.  I thought KVM was already in Hardy
09:10	<csais>	is it better than amsn?
09:10	<boeing>	pengo, this solution is given in tuxmachines.org pls search there
09:10	<corbett>	gnuskool: ive just replugged he maxtor and here are the messages http://paste.ubuntu.com/8002/
09:10	<pengo>	boeing: thanks
09:10	<iGraphiX>	csais: In my opinion, yes. Just try it.
09:11	<csais>	ight thanks man

09:11	<iGraphiX>	You're most welcome, no problem.
09:11	<lacostej>	Hei Hei. Trying to solve #216927, a problem where my keyboard and mouse get stuck. It's happening right now, so if there's a kernel guru that wants me to do something about it, let me know.
09:11	<csais>	what about automatix? is not working anymore right
09:11	<Qrawl>	dystopianray, I dont see it
09:11	<c0mpub0mb>	so.. ubuntu servers are down eh ?
09:11	<Qrawl>	!kvm
09:11	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about kvm - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
09:11	<iGraphiX>	No, they stopped the development.
09:11	<c0mpub0mb>	well rather they are practically dead.
09:11	<dystopianray>	csais: you should not ever use automatix
09:11	<c0mpub0mb>	barely respond.
09:11	<asc>	Heh. dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg doesn't let you select driver or configure the monitor...
09:11	<dystopianray>	Qrawl: what are you looking for?
09:11	<iGraphiX>	Read this article: http://www.getautomatix.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2424

09:12	<dystopianray>	Qrawl: does your cpu have the hardware virtualisation support?
09:12	<bullgard4>	enouf: Synaptic classifies DEB program packages by 'sections'. Does Debian also classify DEB program packages by 'sections'? Searching for 'section' in 'man apt-get' does not return an output.

09:12	<nikitis>	i guess since no one can help me i'll just reinstall windows and ubuntu again
09:12	<corbett>	gnuskool: where u suggesting "gedit/var/log7messages" as a terminal command?
09:13	<Qrawl>	dystopianray, i dont know,  is that a new thing.  my computer is a few years old
09:13	<pengo>	boeing there's nothing on tuxmachines.org.  "Cannot mount volume." is only mentioned on one page (Mandriva 2007.0 alpha livecd)
09:13	<Deathserver>	i cant find this anywhere ne ideas as to where i can DL w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb
09:13	<Qrawl>	dystopianray, I guess I should just install VirtualBox
09:13	<ikonia>	bullgard4: ask debian guys
09:13	<Qrawl>	VirtualBox works good
09:13	<nick_>	ive got an rpm file to install how do i do it
09:13	<Qrawl>	I have no clue what KVM is
09:14	<ikonia>	nick_: it's strongly advised that you don't install rpm's
09:14	<ikonia>	orudie: kernel virtual machine
09:14	<Deathserver>	ne one read LXF
09:14	<ikonia>	Qrawl: kernel virtual machine, sorry
09:14	<ikonia>	Deathserver: offtopic here
09:14	<lalalala>	why use ubuntu its so complicated! vista is so easy click click click and its more stable/secure than ubuntu!
09:14	<iGraphiX>	Deathserver: You can download from here >>>	http://zchan.homeunix.net/pub/Ubuntu.APP/w32codecs_20050412-0.0_i386.deb

=== arooni________ is now known as arooni
09:15	<ikonia>	baddog: that attitude is unaccaptale
09:15]  * baddog pokes #ubuntu-offtopic witha stick

09:16	<nick_>	ikonia: im trying to install adobe flash player for my browser and i went to the adobe website and you can download it in rpm or tar.gz
09:16	<sucka>	ok im actually starting to like this add/remove feature....but i have a cd and on it theres a linux rpm shell installer this link [http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/] tells me that i have to convert the files is this true?
09:17	<ikonia>	nick_: why are you doing that ? there is a package in ubuntu for flash player
09:17	<dystopianray>	Qrawl: kvm needs hardware virtualisation support, a few years old is probably too old for it
09:17	<ikonia>	sucka: it is strongly advised that you don't use rpm's on ubuntu machines
09:17	<sucka>	oh ok
09:17	<nick_>	ikonia: i was trying to view soething and i had to click to download plugin
09:17	<tzfardea>	Well can someone help me :-\ my firefox crashes very often after the upgrade, this is the error in the console "firefox: Fatal IO error 11 (Resource temporarily unavailable) on X server :0.0."
09:17	<nick_>	ikonia: how do i install that
09:17	<ikonia>	nick_: install the flash package through synaptic
09:18	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
09:18	<sucka>	theres also a deb installer but the rpm installer has all the example files for my software hmm..
09:18	<ikonia>	sleepster: put it in your fstab file
09:18	<gord>	sucka: is the program you are looking to install from rpm available via apt?
09:18	<nick_>	ikonia: doing that now
09:18	<nick_>	ikonia: cheers
09:18	<sleepster>	thanks ikonia
09:18	<Qrawl>	dystopianray, ok ty
09:18	<ikonia>	nick_: the package is "flashplugin-nonfree"
09:18	<c0mpub0mb>	does taskel even work ?
09:18	<iGraphiX>	nick_, do this sudo apt-get flashplugin-nonfree
09:18	<sucka>	gord: i am not sure
09:18	<iGraphiX>	It's faster, and close your browser while doing it.
09:19	<Jordan_U>	sucka, What is the application?
09:19	<Qrawl>	!ipv6
09:19	<ubotu>	To disable ipv6 read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WebBrowsingSlowIPv6IPv4
09:19	<sucka>	Jordan_U: it is LPL Language Proof and Logic
09:19	<lacostej>	so noone interested in looking into https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/216927 with me ? :)
09:20	<les>	how can i read from a /dev/ttyUSB0 device from the terminal?
09:20	<boeing>	pengo, is that drive a usb key?
09:20	<nick_>	how do you login to termina
09:20	<pengo>	boeing: yes
09:21	<nick_>	do you have to put password and udername in
09:21	<ikonia>	nick_: just use synaptic if your not comfortable with a terminal
09:21	<iGraphiX>	nick_: First create your UNIX password
09:21	<boeing>	http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/feature/11637.html
09:21	<gord>	sucka: its a educationaltool right? boolean logic etc ?
09:21	<boeing>	to pengo
09:21	<iGraphiX>	Do this in terminal: sudo passwd root
09:21	<ikonia>	iGraphiX: no!
09:21	<nick_>	igraphix: unix password?
09:21	<iGraphiX>	Then follow the instructions.
09:21	<pengo>	boeing: thanks
09:21	<iGraphiX>	yes.
09:21	<ikonia>	iGraphiX: we do not recommend that
09:21	<Jordan_U>	sucka, http://ggww2.stanford.edu/GUS/lpl/faq.jsp#LinuxPackageInstall claims that they provide .deb installers ( which you would just need to double click )
09:21	<sucka>	gord: yes
09:21	<ov1d1u>	hi
09:21	<Naithin|AFK>	Hey guys, assuming a fairly well defragged drive; does using Wubi and a virtual drive image impact performance all that much?
09:21	<nick_>	ikonia: i want to get familiar with the terminal
09:22	<ikonia>	iGraphiX: we do not recommend that, and even less so to new users
09:22	<iGraphiX>	Well, he must know it, too, he will need it eventually.
09:22	<nikitis>	Question:  If I have 3 harddrives, and Windows XP is on harddrive 1 and /boot is on harddrive 2, will that create a problem during ubuntu installation for grub?
09:22	<tobmalf>	considering debian for my hand-me-down MacBookPro; comments welcome
09:22	<ov1d1u>	I have a problem with installing Ubuntu/Kubuntu 8.04
09:22	<ikonia>	iGraphiX: no
09:22	<Deathserver>	where did that file you gave me go to ?
09:22	<ikonia>	nick_: very admirable
09:22	<TB`>	How's got 8.04 up and running then? Is it all good?
09:22	<iGraphiX>	Ovidiu, what seems to be the problem?
09:22	<ikonia>	nick_: you won't need a password to use the terminal
09:22	<ikonia>	TB`: try it
09:22	<boeing>	pengo, and fstab is for permanancy,eg.a new hdd so i dont think u need to change there
09:22	<TB`>	How are you finding it so far ikonia?
09:22	<ov1d1u>	My PC freez at 24% (sometimes at 27%) when it's copy the files
09:22	<ikonia>	nick_: open a terminal from the applications accessories menu
09:22	<ikonia>	TB`: try it for yourself
09:22	<tobmalf>	\.. it's already building the kernel
09:22	<l2s>	hi
09:22	<dystopianray>	TB`: I use kubuntu and I think this is the best release yet, much better than 7.10
09:22	<abli>	Hi! having installed hardy, and kubuntu-desktop on it apparently automounting in gnome broke: it works if I use a kde session, but in gnome sessions if I plug in the usb thumbdrive, it doesn't get mounted. judging from dmesg it gets recognized correctly. What should I check?
09:22	<nick_>	ikonia: yip
09:23	<TB`>	dystopianray: excellent
09:23	<nikitis>	Anyone?
09:23	<ikonia>	nick_: then "sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree"
09:23	<corbett>	Zloog:  what do u think of this           http://paste.ubuntu.com/8002/
09:23	<Line_>	ok, distaster alert: unbutu 8.04 install cd ->	selected install ubuntu ->	i was not prompted on what i would like to do with  my partitions ->	now i've lost my raid array
09:23	<l2s>	I am using the hardy heron alt version and did a sudo tasksel install lamp-server
09:23	<Line_>	am i screwed?
09:23	<tobmalf>	 so, anything wrong? The range of IP I would like pg to listen is 10.1.1.0 (0..255)
09:23	<sucka>	Jordan_U: ive tried double clicking the deb installed but then what do i do run in terminal or what?
09:23	<gord>	sucka: hmm, well let me explain breifly, RPM is the Red Hat Package manager, designed for a different flavour of linux, we'd recoomne dusing APT desighned for this ubuntu flavour....but u cant i think, its only avaiilable in rpm for you. u have no real cjhoice but to try,. normally rpm scause future troubles that apt doesnt
09:23	<l2s>	it just hangs on the screen and never gets past 0% apt-get update and upgrade work fine
09:23	<ikonia>	Line_: data gone
09:23	<l2s>	anyone know if hardy heron broke tasksel?
09:23	<baddog>	:/
09:24	<Sajuukkhar>	guys if i insert my flash drive, where will it be in terms of root?
09:24	<nikitis>	l2s: servers are heavily bogged down now
09:24	<gord>	sucka: rpm's arent totally evil, just not optimum, and arent supported
09:24]  * baddog feels sorry for Line_
09:24	<Line_>	lovely how can i install ubuntu onto a raid array?
09:24	<tobmalf>	 i had jamals help already
09:24	<Scorchin>	hi, ever since the update to 8.04, my mount points do not work. I've updated any changes to name /etc/* in the fstab yet it won't show the drives as files when mounted, only their respective GB sizes
09:24	<l2s>	is there any other way to install it ?
09:24	<ikonia>	Line_: use a supported raid card/technology
09:24	<sucka>	gord: i see
09:24	<asc>	Sajuukkhar: usually in a subdirectory of /media
09:24	<nick_>	where can i learn about the terminal and the commands
09:24	<Sajuukkhar>	mmk
09:24	<notsniw>	hi.. i want to add another hdd. what is the easiest way to partition/format/add it? i installed gparted, but i wont work. when i run it, it wont stop scanning the system..
09:24	<Jordan_U>	sucka, Can you pastebin the output of "dpkg -L <package name>" ?
09:24	<l2s>	its been waiting 10 minutes and not moving
09:24	<ikonia>	nick_: http://www.tldp.org
09:24	<Sajuukkhar>	its just that i cant find it there
09:24	<Sajuukkhar>	im running ubuntu in recovery mode
09:24	<Line_>	is Gigabyte technologies GsataII supported?
09:24	<nikitis>	l2s: yea took 20 mins for me to install gcc
09:24	<sucka>	gord: i know that it works fine cause i installed it on 7.10
09:24	<Sajuukkhar>	cos of a huge line of problems
09:25	<Sajuukkhar>	im backing up my system
09:25	<sucka>	gord: i can try
09:25	<ikonia>	Line_: fakeraid which is what your using is not really a supported/stable platform
09:25	<corbett>	maxtor external hard drive problem any advice?    http://paste.ubuntu.com/8002/
09:25	<Sajuukkhar>	and reformatting
09:25	<l2s>	ah
09:25	<asc>	sajukkhar: Is it mounted? check df -h, it would be the last item on the list
09:25	<gord>	sucka: well, at your own risk....i never had a problem that i could fix tho :)
09:25	<Sajuukkhar>	k lemme check
09:25	<Line_>	should i utilize my onboard nvidia raid controller? or will i need a hardware solution?
09:25	<gord>	coulkdnt fox rofl
09:25	<l2s>	wish they would use bittorrent only to distribute new releases
09:25	<sucka>	couldnt?
09:25	<sucka>	haha
09:25	<Naithin|AFK>	Hey guys, assuming a fairly well defragged drive; does using Wubi and a virtual drive image impact performance all that much?
09:25	<ikonia>	Line_: onboard nvidia controller = fake raid
09:25	<Line_>	wow
09:25	<gord>	somebody buy me a new kdb and fingers
09:25	<asc>	They do, it's just that some bonehead took it off the main download page a couple releases back :p
09:26	<Sajuukkhar>	nope
09:26	<Sajuukkhar>	not there
09:26	<nikitis>	Grub Question:  If my Bios boots SDA with windows on it, then I go to install ubuntu on SDB.  Where will grub write the boot loader?
09:26	<Sajuukkhar>	hsould i try another usb port?
09:26	<bazhang>	Naithin|AFK: wubi is never going to be that fast; better to move it to an lvm or use unetbootin
09:26	<iGraphiX>	ov1d1u: Have you checked the CD, it's perhaps the CD, if not, try to check your hard-drive, do a defrag, check MBR and repair it, then re-create partitions
09:26	<ov1d1u>	isn't the CD
09:26	<ov1d1u>	i have testet with 3 cd's
09:26	<Line_>	anyone know a way for me to recover files from a destroyed raid0 (2 drives) ?
09:26	<ov1d1u>	two kubuntu cds and one with ubuntu
09:26	<les>	how can i read from a /dev/ttyUSB0 device from the terminal?
09:26	<ikonia>	Line_: it's gone
09:27	<Line_>	oiy
09:27	<iGraphiX>	Check the MD5
09:27	<asc>	Sajuukkhar: Nah, just mount it manually. Uh, do 'ls /dev/sd*' It'll list a couple things. The flash drive's partition should be the last item on the list.
09:27	<Ziroday>	les: you mean mount it?
09:27	<icqnumber>	!md5
09:27	<Naithin|AFK>	bazhang: Thanks baz. So I can take that to say then that there is significant and noticeable impact by using Wubi? Ah well. Will be worth a try at least, want to see if I can coax my X-Fi card to work under a 32bit linux install this time around. heh
09:27	<ubotu>	To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
09:27	<Line_>	alright, so if i wish to install ubuntu on my current configuration i will need to use just one drive until i can find a hardware raid solution?
09:27	<nikitis>	Grub Question: If my Bios boots SDA with windows on it, then I go to install ubuntu on SDB. Where will grub write the boot loader?
09:27	<ikonia>	Line_: or use linux software raid, but that is a much more complex solution
09:27	<l2s>	btw ebay is real cheap for ide raid controllers
09:27	<ikonia>	nikitis: should be sda
09:28	<Line_>	alrighty
09:28	<memetali>	I have a keyboard layout problem can anyone help
09:28	<asc>	Sajuukkhar: run 'sudo mount /dev/sd__ /mnt' where sd__ is the last item on the list, and it'll mount it on /mnt
09:28	<l2s>	look for 3ware 7506-4 or -2
09:28	<Line_>	thanks again ikonia
09:28	<JCSmith1337>	If I have an Intel Quadcore 6600 processor, which flavor of Hardy Heron should I get?  32bit or 64bit?
09:28	<Jordan_U>	l2s, That's fakeraid though
09:28	<l2s>	less than 30 bucs
09:28	<nikitis>	ikonia: will it do it automatically?  Or do I have to tell it sda?
09:28	<l2s>	no its not
09:28	<ikonia>	JCSmith1337: depends on your need
09:28	<l2s>	its a real ide raid card not software raid
09:28	<OsamaK>	What's Ubuntu DVD?
09:28	<les>	how can i read from a /dev/ttyUSB0 device from the terminal?
09:28	<ikonia>	nikitis: should do it auto
09:28	<Sajuukkhar>	o i get it
09:28	<OsamaK>	Does it includes all versions?
09:28	<asc>	JCSmith1337: Flash and some video codecs sometimes don't like to work with 64-bit
09:28	<Sajuukkhar>	im running in recovery mode
09:28	<JCSmith1337>	ikonia: is 32bit more stable?
09:28	<Sajuukkhar>	whence why i cant see it
09:28	<ikonia>	JCSmith1337: not really no
09:28	<asc>	Aha.
09:29	<OsamaK>	ikonia: Mr. Helper :-)
09:29	<Maxdamantus>	les, just output it to the terminal? dd if=/dev/ttyUSB0
09:29	<hugol1>	jeanre or exaile
09:29	<Sajuukkhar>	ok then
09:29	<OsamaK>	ikonia: What's Ubuntu DVD?
09:29	<Sajuukkhar>	i shall reboot
09:29	<l2s>	great cards going cheap
09:29	<gluer>	think i preferred #ubuntu+1
09:29	<ikonia>	OsamaK: more cmoplete repos
09:29	<nikitis>	JCSmith1337: more packages are supported with 32-bit
09:29	<Sajuukkhar>	but how do i boot only to terminal and not to gnome
09:29	<OsamaK>	ikonia: Does it includes all versions?
09:29	<tobmalf>	http://www.officerecovery.com/freeundelete/download.htm.. Installing an undelete program can overwrite your file :).. ccleaner is okay, but not the end all
09:29	<JCSmith1337>	nikitis:  thanks :D
09:29	<DracoZA>	please can someone help me, my system was running perfectly and now its just screwed!
09:29	<asc>	nikitis: Really? Which ones?
09:29	<ikonia>	it includes the repos - not versions
09:29	<nikitis>	JCSmith1337: not really a performance difference
09:29	<OsamaK>	ikonia: repos?
09:30	<nikitis>	JCSmith1337: 32-bit will still use all 4 cores
09:30	<ikonia>	OsamaK: software repositories, sorry
09:30	<iGraphiX>	:)
09:30	<JCSmith1337>	nikitis:  thanks that was my next question
09:30	<JCSmith1337>	Looks like im off to grab the 32 bit
09:30	<asc>	JCSmith1337: There can be a performance difference actually. For example, I noticed a 30% reduction in CPU with h.64 playback with 64-bit.
09:30	<JCSmith1337>	thanks so much!
09:30	<Fritzel>	where do you change the pointer theme?
09:30	<arbrandes>	Hey dudes, NFS4 problem: can't connect to an export on a Gutsy server, with the error: "mount.nfs4: requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported".  It worked just before the upgrade to Hardy.  Any suggestions?
09:31	<tobmalf>	I dont get it why people hate Hillary though.. UNTIL.. until I learn about this guy Peter Paul

09:31	<asc>	he's already gone.
09:31	<DracoZA>	how dows ubuntu boot up without a xorg.conf ?
09:31	<hbaum>	hei
09:31	<asc>	Also, I'd love to know what one can't do with 64-bit
09:31	<Jordan_U>	tobmalf, Try #politics
09:31	<Naithin|AFK>	Does this release of the 64bit kernel work with Intel C2D chips?  I heard that it wasn't so well supported with the 7.04 release.
09:31	<Sajuukkhar>	it doesnt
09:31	<ikonia>	DracoZA: it's dynamic
09:31	<Sajuukkhar>	my xorg screwed up too draco
09:31	<asc>	Naithin|AFK: Yes, it works.
09:32	<IndyGunFreak>	Fritzel: right click your desktop, change background, click the theme tab, whatever theme you have enabled(its probably labeled custom), click modify, then click the "pointer" tab
09:32	<Sajuukkhar>	i suggest reformatting and installing fresh
09:32	<DracoZA>	ikonia dynamic ?
09:32	<Naithin|AFK>	Thanks Asc.
09:32	<ikonia>	Naithin|AFK: you heard wrong
09:32	<Deathserver>	dell inspiron 1525 video acceleration problems any thing i can do?
09:32	<Fritzel>	IndyGunFreak, excellent thank you
09:32	<ikonia>	DracoZA: xorg trys to work out your hardware settings and is overriddent by the xorg config file
09:32	<iGraphiX>	DracoZA and Sajuukkhar: You guys tried the restricted software? E.g. nVidia.
09:32	<arbrandes>	iGraphiX, i did, working fine here.
09:32	<iGraphiX>	Yes, here too.
09:32	<Sajuukkhar>	igraphic shall i link you to my post on ubuntuforums?
09:33	<iGraphiX>	At some point takes control of your xorg. And I guess they are having this problem.
09:33	<DracoZA>	ikonia ok, does nvidia-settings have a seperate conf file of some sort ?
09:33	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, yes, please.
09:33	<ikonia>	DracoZA: that normally runs in memory
09:33	<ikonia>	DracoZA: changes would have to be written to xorg.conf
09:33	<Maxdamantus>	DracoZA, nvidia-settings save to the normal Xorg.conf
09:33	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, read what ikonia just wrote.
09:33	<Maxdamantus>	It does backups though, I think.
09:33	<sephiroth>	hey have any of you managed to network into a PS3?
09:33	<dny>	UGH, my sound keeps going out, and I have to restart for it to work again.  Is there a way to restart ALSA or something? :/
09:33	<sephiroth>	im tryna send music over
09:34	<Ziroday>	How do I get hyperlinks in pidgin and thunderbird to open up in firefox?
09:34	<DracoZA>	Maxdamantus will it read the backups if no xorg.conf exists ?
09:34	<Rafik>	hello :)
09:34	<Maxdamantus>	DracoZA, no.
09:34	<ikonia>	DracoZA: no
09:34	<Sajuukkhar>	just wait on
09:34	<ikonia>	DracoZA: you have to tell it to read the files
09:34	<Maxdamantus>	X looks for /etc/x11/Xorg.conf
09:34	<Maxdamantus>	If it doesn't exist, it'll guess some settings./
09:35	<Koheleth>	I have installed Ubuntu 64bit alongside Vista, but now I want Ubuntu 32bit because of program problems, if I just reinstall will it use the 64 bit partitioning etc or install along side the 64bit?
09:35	<teban>	hi, how can i auto mount partitions on hardy? gutsy used to mount them automatically... hardy doesn't
09:35	<Rafik>	please, I've a probleme with an USB flash disk.. KINGMAX 1Gb.. gutsy don't detect it at all
09:35	<Rafik>	can anyone help me ?
09:35	<ikonia>	Koheleth: you tell it what partition to use
09:35	<Maxdamantus>	teban, /etc/fstab?
09:35	<Sajuukkhar>	my problem
09:35	<Sajuukkhar>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=765574
09:35	<OsamaK>	ikonia: That's meaning all programs that can be installed?
09:36	<ikonia>	OsamaK: all the ones written to the cd
09:36	<teban>	yeah i've read about that... but i don't know exactly what i have to add to that file
09:36	<ikonia>	OsamaK: dvd sorry
09:36	<Ziroday>	Rafik: there should be know issues with flash disk can you pastebin fdisk -l please
09:36	<Koheleth>	ikonia: I hate messing with partitions :(
09:36	<Sajuukkhar>	but
09:36	<ikonia>	Koheleth: "select partition /dev/sda2" is not "messing with partitions"
09:36	<teban>	the partitions are /media/sda1 and /media/sda5
09:36	<OsamaK>	ikonia: you need a cup of tea to be more relax :-)
09:36	<sephiroth>	yeah i got gutsy and i keep hearing that its predesessor was so much better
09:36	<ikonia>	OsamaK: what ? I'm relaxed
09:36	<Sajuukkhar>	im asking how do i just boot to the terminal and not to GNOME
09:37	<Sajuukkhar>	recovery mode doesnt see my flash drive
09:37	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: use recovery mode, or remove gdm from the start up runlevel
09:37	<Rafik>	Ziroday, i send you this in an mp ?
09:37	<Sajuukkhar>	or my Ipod
09:37	<MrWGW->	the Ubiquity installer failed to install GRUB and didn't tell me about it, it just crashed (really crappy btw for an LTS release I must say)
09:37	<Koheleth>	sda1 will be where my windows install is right
09:37	<MrWGW->	what is the value that GRUB needs for the initrd?
09:37	<bazhang>	Rafik: this is gutsy? I use the kingmax 8GB and see it fine (though this is Hardy)
09:37	<Ziroday>	Rafik: no in pastebin
09:37	<tobmalf>	z.z don't even remind me of that screw up dushantch
09:37	<Sajuukkhar>	how do i use remove gdm?
09:37	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: none
09:37	<Ziroday>	!paste | Rafik
09:37	<MrWGW->	and are there any special parameters that the UBuntu kernel requires?
09:37	<ubotu>	Rafik: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
09:37	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: update-rc
09:37	<neuronyk>	hi
09:37	<sucka>	gord: i downloaded the deb file from the lop website and when i opened it it said that it was either corrupt or i di not have permission to open the file
09:37	<tobmalf>	what?
09:37	<MrWGW->	iknoia: if I just tell it to boot /vmlinuz, the kernel panics
09:37	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: sudo apt-get remove gdm
09:38	<Sajuukkhar>	k
09:38	<ikonia>	Ziroday: no no no no
09:38	<ikonia>	Ziroday: he meant from the start up
09:38	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, that's not an initrd.
09:38	<Koheleth>	btw can ubuntu be uninstalled?
09:38	<Maxdamantus>	That's a kernel.
09:38	<Sajuukkhar>	i also have no mouse drivers
09:38	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: that will delete it from your system
09:38	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: wait stop
09:38	<ikonia>	Koheleth: no
09:38	<Koheleth>	:)
09:38	<ikonia>	Koheleth: you have to delete it
09:38	<Ziroday>	ikonia: woops, sorry
09:38	<Maxdamantus>	The initrd is an initial filesystem image.
09:38	<FloodBot2>	ikonia: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
09:38	<MrWGW->	Maxdamantus: no duh
09:38	<Koheleth>	I thought so
09:38	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: that command will delete from your system
09:38	<neuronyk>	does anyone know what option i have to give to grub in order to install in safe graphic mode ?
09:38	<MrWGW->	yes quite, and GRUB says that /initrd.img does't exist, even though it does
09:38	<IndyGunFreak>	Sajuukkhar: why do you need mouse drivers?
09:38	<tobmalf>	id
09:38	<Sajuukkhar>	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=765574
09:38	<Sajuukkhar>	read
09:38	<MrWGW->	and if I just tell it to boot /vmlinuz as the kernel, and do not specify an initrd, it panics
09:38	<Rafik>	Ziroday : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64333/ thanks
09:38	<Baughn>	Is there a netboot image for Hardy? There doesn't seem to be one on the cd I downloaded, like the howto suggests
09:38	<Koheleth>	I think sda1 and sda2 are both windows
09:38	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, so you have /boot as a separate partition?
09:39	<MrWGW->	I'm primarily ticked that Ubiquity just crashed without even giving me a warning
09:39	<MrWGW->	no
09:39	<teban>	i read i should add these lines to fstab...
09:39	<teban>	/dev/hda4 /media/nameyouchoose auto defaults 0 1
09:39	<teban>	/dev/hda6 /media/othernameyouchoose auto defaults 0 1
09:39	<stimpie>	I have a scrollwheel on my keyboard, does anyone know how to get that working?
09:39	<teban>	in my case...
09:39	<Koheleth>	so I guess it will be sda3 I will choose to use for Ubuntu
09:39	<MrWGW->	"/" is one partitoin, there isn't even a separate home
09:39	<tobmalf>	all the time :)
09:39	<Maxdamantus>	Then it doesn't. It'll be under /boot/initrd.img unless you specifically moved it to /
09:39	<bazhang>	Baughn: should be; unetbootin would be the one--what is your host os
09:39	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: looks like your "root" is wrong then
09:39	<teban>	should it be /dev/sda1 /media/sda1 defaults 0 1?
09:39	<MrWGW->	GRUB is installed on a different partition, the root of a Fedora install
09:39	<Ziroday>	Rafik: can you verify the thumbdrive is working?
09:39	<MrWGW->	my root is right (hd0,11), I know that because the kernel starts if I boot it
09:39	<Baughn>	bazhang: Host os? Debian, I guess
09:39	<MrWGW->	it just panics, complaining about not synching
09:39	<tobmalf>	thanks :D
09:39	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: so thats the problem then
09:40	<MrWGW->	ok, so what parameters does it require?
09:40	<Rafik>	Ziroday : you mean, test it on another computer ?
09:40	<MrWGW->	what is the address of the initrd, if there is one?
09:40	<tobmalf>	yeah
09:40	<Ziroday>	Rafik: yep
09:40	<bazhang>	Baughn: if you /msg ubotu wubi you can read the ubuntuforums links on unetbootin
09:40	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, boot a live!cd version, backup your files and do a clean install. If you're trying to repair all those errors it will take more than a clean install, so why bother, just install. And make sure you chose a closer mirror for the updates in the future.
09:40	<MrWGW->	initrd.img is "not found" by GRUB, even though I know it to be there...
09:40	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: what partition is your ubuntu install on
09:40	<Ziroday>	Rafik: one where you know it works or is Windows/Mac
09:40	<MrWGW->	(hd0,11)
09:40	<Sajuukkhar>	igraph, my internet downloads 25kb/s
09:40	<Sajuukkhar>	its the fastest i can get
09:40	<iGraphiX>	Auch!
09:40	<DracoZA>	ikonia I use a nvidia card, will my system work properly if I dont use restricted drivers
09:41	<bazhang>	Rafik: did you use the usbkey before? the kingmax I have is fine
09:41	<MrWGW->	I'm in the GRUB console right now, so if you just tell me what to enter, I'll enter it, and then copy it over into the GRUB menu.lst
09:41	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: initrd is not called "initrd"
09:41	<Sajuukkhar>	and also
09:41	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, so you have 11 partitions + extended?
09:41	<Rafik>	bazhang : Yes
09:41	<tobmalf>	*nods* try putting a 4 5 after the 1 2 3 6 7
09:41	<Sajuukkhar>	i did put in my ubuntu dapper live cd
09:41	<Rafik>	Ziroday : Ivnt another pc now :(
09:41	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: it's called initrd.img-$version-$type
09:41	<jeffimperial>	thought i was the only 1 getting slow DL
09:41	<Sajuukkhar>	and it didnt see my sajuuk folder
09:41	<jeffimperial>	mine is ~25k
09:41	<MrWGW->	I have lots of partitions
09:41	<memetali>	KEYBOARD LAYOUT PROBLEM PLEASE HELP
09:41	<MrWGW->	and its in boot?
09:41	<OsamaK>	ikonia: Is there a DVD that includes all [K,X,ED]Ubuntu?
09:41	<ikonia>	memetali: don't show
09:41	<ikonia>	memetali: don't shout
09:41	<MrWGW->	hmm the kernel requires the root partition be passed to it as a parameter?
09:41	<Ziroday>	Rafik: okay no prob, just try plugging the thumb drive into a different USB port
09:41	<ikonia>	memetali: it gets you put on ignore
09:41	<iGraphiX>	Then do a clean install with the 8.04 and that's it. There will be some time until next updates anyway.
09:42	<Baughn>	bazhang: I don't have an OS on the machine I'm planning to install ubuntu on
09:42	<ikonia>	OsamaK: they are the same system - different desktops
09:42	<sucka>	gord: and the files that are download dont have an extension of .deb do i change it to it or not?
09:42	<Baughn>	bazhang: That's whyI was looking for a netboot image specifically
09:42	<memetali>	ikonia
09:42	<OsamaK>	I see
09:42	<visine>	where i can configure vga driver ?
09:42	<tobmalf>	 "su user" will keep the same prompt variables the user HAD... it won't cause it to change.. LordFrith, su - user will reset it, so could change the prompt
09:42	<tobmalf>	it does them too. but i haven't played with that much. i just make the round labels usually
09:43	<MrWGW->	so what would the pathnames be then for the default kernel and initrd in 8.04?
09:43	<Rafik>	Ziroday : I did it : same thing, the usb port is working with my optical mouse
09:43	<Baughn>	bazhang: ..unetbootin looks like it should work, I guess. Wubi, not so much.
09:43	<Sajuukkhar>	i know i can just screw up my xorg file and do it through
09:43	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: mount your partition and look at what version your using
09:43	<Sajuukkhar>	there
09:43	<memetali>	KEYBOARD LAYOUT PROBLEM PLEASE HELP
09:43	<ikonia>	memetali: last request, stop shouting
09:43	<bazhang>	Baughn: need windows for wubi ;]
09:43	<bazhang>	caps memetali
09:43	<ikonia>	memetali: it will end up getting you into trouble
09:43	<memetali>	ok
09:43	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, check /boot/
09:43	<MrWGW->	well, are the kernel and initrd in boot the default ones?
09:43	<tobmalf>	i'm having a tough time figuring out which drive is faulty (i have 2 on raid0).. system is in LA. im in bangkok
09:43	<MrWGW->	or are the default ones those off the root?
09:43	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: just look for your self
09:44	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: mount your ubuntu partition and look in the /boot partition
09:44	<Ziroday>	Rafik: okay then, stuff like usb flash drives nearly always work with linux, check to make sure the flash drive is actually working
09:44	<MrWGW->	look, how about we make this easier, could anyone post their /boot/grub/menu.lst to Pastebin?
09:44	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: how about we make this clear
09:44	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: look for your self
09:44	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: mount the ubuntu partition
09:44	<Maxdamantus>	http://p.facepwn.com/25
09:44	<Maxdamantus>	^ MrWGW-

09:45	<preme>	I just installed Ubuntu and works just fine. downloaded a google mail notifier for linux and unpacked in the terminal and started it and it works fine. BUT if i close the terminal window that i opened the program with, the program closes aswell.
09:45	<preme>	and if I would like that program to autostart where to go?
09:45	<Ziroday>	Rafik: sorry think it might be naft, if it works on a different comp come back
09:45	<Maxdamantus>	prem, press alt + f2, run it there.
09:45	<Maxdamantus>	Afk.

09:46	<Ziroday>	Rafik: no problem
09:46	<tobmalf>	ican't help you...no mplayer on my server
09:46	<preme>	insalled i don't know i configured it with ./notifer.py

09:46	<bazhang>	preme: just install from the repos
09:46	<preme>	bazhang:  can i speak with you in private?
09:46	<bazhang>	better to do it in channel preme
09:47	<preme>	what is the repos?
09:47	<artenius>	prem: you could run it in screen and detach, or append it with an &
09:47	<arstanj>	Hi, is there problems with mirrors? I can't seem like install new stuff with apt-get install
09:47	<preme>	& ?
09:47	<bazhang>	sudo apt-get install gmail-notify preme
09:47	<artenius>	prem: do what bazhang says
09:47	<XceII>	preme:  synaptic
09:47	<bazhang>	arstanj: may be slow from the recent release of hardy
09:47	<hang3r>	Does anyone know why I can't share a directory, I keep getting the following error: 'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: cannot open usershare directory /var/lib/samba/usershares. Error Permission denied
09:48	<arstanj>	bazhang: yeah, might be
09:48	<preme>	hm ok gonna try that
09:48	<MrWGW->	I'd assume its still possible to go root=/dev/sda12 as opposed to using the device ID?
09:48	<arstanj>	bazhang: I try other repos still same
09:48	<MrWGW->	also does the rootfs need to be mounted read only?
09:48	<preme>	I need to read a good manual. I don't even know where to put installed programs and such
09:48	<bazhang>	arstanj: please pastebin sources.list
09:49	<preme>	used to the windows setup
09:49	<IndyGunFreak>	bazhang: i've not tried gmail-notify, checkgmail works nicely though
09:49	<preme>	but Im willing to learn so thanks for the help
09:49	<MrWGW->	and also, will anything break if I don't give it the "quiet" and "splash" params?  I prefer a non-quiet boot to aid in troubleshooting
09:49	<bazhang>	preme: you don t need to it will do it for you
09:49	<doogers>	Hi!
09:49	<bazhang>	IndyGunFreak: thanks!
09:49	<XceII>	preme:  youll get the hang of it,
09:49	<preme>	IndyGunFreak: does it works with google mail?
09:49	<MrWGW->	preme: use Add/Remove Software, or the Synaptic Package Manager, its fully automatic
09:49	<artenius>	prem: If you use the synaptic package manager, it will put things in the right place for you.
09:49	<doogers>	it's possible have the wiki code of ubuntu?
09:49	<MrWGW->	almost, but not entirely unlike an "iTunes Style Interface" perhaps
09:49	<bazhang>	preme: you may also try checkgmail
09:49	<ikonia>	doogers: it's an open source product
09:49	<asc>	Does a default install have any tool that can display the size of a non-mounted partition?
09:49	<preme>	MrWGW-: but is google notifier there?
09:50	<lalalala>	...........................
09:50	<MrWGW->	maybe, look

09:50	<XceII>	preme:  it is also in addremove
09:50	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: yes,... quite well actually... ony thing i've found is you have to manually add it to your startup programs so it starts on boot, beyond that though, i love it.. you can delete mails, mark spam, etc, w/o even loggig into your account
09:50	<doogers>	ikonia: what's its name?
09:50	<ikonia>	doogers: it's on the bottom of the pages

09:51	<lalalala>	i asked zillion times
09:51	<Sajuukkhar>	is there a shortcut to access terminal in GNOME without a mouse?
09:51	<bazhang>	lalalala: ask in #winehq or check appdb
09:51	<arj>	Sajuukkhar: alt-f2 ->	gnome-terminal ->	enter
09:51	<arj>	(that's one way that works at least)
09:51	<eckesicle>	I have my .evolution from a previous unix installation. Evolution does not seem to recognize my old settings if I just put it in ~/.evolution though. Is there anyway to import the settings?
09:51	<Sajuukkhar>	k
09:52	<Fritzel>	I can't change pointer themes via appearance even though the option is there, does compiz or any other package fight with those settings for pointer themes?
09:52	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: you can create a keyboard shortcut in Preferences >	Keyboard Shortcuts
09:52	<bazhang>	!appdb | lalalala

09:52	<Sajuukkhar>	ziro i cant use my mouse
09:52	<MrWGW->	actually, GRUB says it can't find the initrd, although I can guarantee you its there
09:52	<preme>	didn't find it in add program
09:52	<doogers>	ikonia: thanks
09:52	<MrWGW->	will the system boot without the initrd?
09:52	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: its in the repositories
09:52	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: system/admin/synaptic
09:52	<arbrandes>	MrWGW-, no, it won't
09:52	<MrWGW->	its an ext3 FS
09:52	<hang3r>	Does anyone know why I can't share a directory, I keep getting the following error: 'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare: cannot open usershare directory /var/lib/samba/usershares. Error Permission denied
09:52]  * MrWGW- fears there might be some nasty bug with GRUB
09:53	<unop>	hang3r, do you need sudo there?
09:53	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: do a search for checkgmail  it will pop up
09:53	<MrWGW->	why that pathetic Ubiquity installer couldn't have just done its job I can't imagine, in my experience Ubiquity is one of the most brittle and untrustworthy installers of any Linux distro - I'd be using a different distro except I need LTSP
09:53	<jeffimperial>	I can't get my upgrade to work for a variety of reasons.. is there any way that i can in some way "automate" the transfer of all my stuff (docs, DLs, folders, torrents, mails, etc.) from Gutsy?
09:53]  * MrWGW- sighs
09:53	<DracoZA>	how can I reset all themes/icons and other cosmetics to ubuntu defaults ?
09:53	<preme>	oh another "packer" so you guys almost never install programs that are not in the synaptic or the add/remove program?
09:53	<XceII>	preme:  system\administration\synaptic package manager.....at the top...use the search
09:53	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: there is not
09:53	<hang3r>	unop, This is from the gui, I'll try running nautilus as root and see what happens
09:53	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: synaptic is generally the way to go...
09:53	<arbrandes>	MrWGW-, haven't had any problems with it.
09:53	<preme>	cool
09:54	<preme>	how to add it to the autostart? so I don't have to start it myself every time?
09:54	<tobmalf>	check /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters and the ilk
09:54	<bazhang>	MrWGW-: no problems here; you multi-booting?
09:54	<Fritzel>	er wait no it did change my pointers sorta
09:54	<Fritzel>	it only changed some of them
09:54	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: just make sure you install checkgmail and not kcheckgmail
09:54	<IndyGunFreak>	unless your using kdE of course
09:54	<Sajuukkhar>	booyeah!
09:54	<bazhang>	capital KDE ;]
09:55	<XceII>	lol
09:55]  * IndyGunFreak never capitalizes kde..lol
09:55	<arstanj>	How to remove a package with all the config and init scripts altogether? apt-get remove --purge?
09:55	<doogers>	ikonia: nothing?
09:55	<MrWGW->	bazhang: yes
09:55	<preme>	yes I took checkgmail , runnin on gnome
09:55	<tobmalf>	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
09:55	<MrWGW->	and Ubuntu tends to puke all over my GRUB config
09:55	<ikonia>	doogers: no, I can't find the link any more
09:55	<bazhang>	MrWGW-: that is the likely source then
09:55	<MrWGW->	for that matter, I'm at a loss as to why GRUB can't find the Ubuntu initrd
09:55	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: let it install...
09:55	<MrWGW->	well frankly, most distros handle multibooting just fine
09:55	<khecim>	hello, can some one please post checksum for file "ubuntu-8.04-desktop-amd64.iso", because there is no checksum on "https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes" web page
09:55	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: what is the exact error your getting
09:56	<abli>	Hi! having installed hardy, and kubuntu-desktop on it apparently automounting in gnome broke: it works if I use a kde session, but in gnome sessions if I plug in the usb thumbdrive, it doesn't get mounted. judging from dmesg it gets recognized correctly. What should I check?
09:56	<hang3r>	unop, cheers, wasn't thinking, been a late night waiting for ubuntu release :)
09:56	<MrWGW->	*/the path of initrd/*: File not found
09:56	<bazhang>	MrWGW-: multi-boot many distros here; ubuntu is one of the best at playing with others imo
09:56	<icqnumber>	lalalala, you do not really need wine, you can intall windows and linux on one computer, side by side, to play in windows, and to do the rest in linux
09:56	<preme>	IndyGunFreak: it's installed
09:56	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: the path should just be /
09:56	<MrWGW->	where */the path of initrd/* == whatever I entered in
09:56	<icqnumber>	khecim, ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/linux/ubuntu/releases/hardy/MD5SUMS
09:56	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: ok, applications/internet Gmail checker
09:56	<IndyGunFreak>	and set up your account
09:56	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: paste your menu.lst please.
09:56	<MrWGW->	well, that's difficult since its on the other box
09:56	<preme>	nothing happends when i click it though
09:57	<Fujisan>	seveas de dwaas :)
09:57	<MrWGW->	but hold on
09:57	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: put it on a floppy/usb-stick something
09:57	<preme>	come now just a little slow
09:57	<unop>	hang3r, well, i'm not sure why you were getting that , though sudo shouldnt have been necessary - but anyway
09:57	<Fujisan>	hin guys
09:57	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: you should get a window to configure your gmail account
09:57	<XceII>	preme:  its because you did not uninstall the last one,
09:57	<elkbuntu>	Fujisan, this is a support channel, not a social channel
09:57	<preme>	works it came
09:57	<tobmalf>	the last one, can't remember full name.. it had the word 'services' in it though
09:57	<jeffimperial>	I can't get my upgrade to work for a variety of reasons.. is there any way that i can in some way "automate" the transfer of all my stuff (docs, DLs, folders, torrents, mails, etc.) from Gutsy?
09:57	<arstanj>	bazhang: How to remove package with all configs/init scripts altogether?
09:57	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: once you set it up with your account, you should see an envelope in your taskbar...
09:57	<IndyGunFreak>	it will be red when you get mail
09:58	<preme>	IndyGunFreak: yes I see it. Cool ubuntu is smooth
09:58	<bazhang>	arstanj: the purge option
09:58	<preme>	will it start everytime I reboot my computer?
09:58	<Fujisan>	whats the equivalent of ctrl+alt+delete on ubuntu?
09:58	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: now you need to add checkgmail to your startup programs
09:58	<preme>	:)
09:58	<arstanj>	bazhang: apt-get remove --purge apache2?
09:58	<Fujisan>	sometimes my ubuntu locks app
09:58	<bazhang>	Fujisan: what does that do?
09:58	<Fujisan>	and i need that function
09:58	<ikonia>	Fujisan: didn't you get in trouble for asking about ctrl+alt+delete yesterday
09:58	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: click SYstem/Preferences/Sessions
09:59	<Fujisan>	no
09:59	<Fujisan>	that wasnt me
09:59	<Fujisan>	i never been here before
09:59	<elkbuntu>	Fujisan, you have so.
09:59	<Myrtti>	Fujisan: depends on what you try to get with pressing those buttons
09:59	<bazhang>	Fujisan: saw you yesterday
09:59	<ikonia>	Fujisan: yes, you did you where banned yesteday
09:59	<Ubuntu_4_l1fe>	Fujisan: you need the system monitor
09:59	<Fujisan>	no that wasnt me
09:59	<Zasch>	Is there any way to mount a CD image in Ubuntu?
09:59	<bazhang>	!ot | Fujisan
09:59	<ubotu>	Fujisan: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
09:59	<sucka>	ahh do you guys know that wireless bar thing that tells you which wireless netowrk ur connected to and the signal strength in bars/.. and its usually in the notification area... i was moving my bars around and i lost it.. how can i get it back?
09:59	<preme>	IndyGunFreak: when I take add there it ask for a command. what is the command to start checkgmail?
09:59	<arstanj>	bazhang: it still kept /etc/apache2 and /etc/init.d/apache2 files
10:00	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: this exactly     checkgmail
10:00	<ikonia>	Zasch: mount -o loop
10:00	<Fujisan>	No i mean the equivalent of ctrl+alt+delte to bring up the system manager when the system locks up??
10:00	<Fujisan>	thats a fair question
10:00	<bazhang>	arstanj: how about synaptic remove completely
10:00	<preme>	is there any shortcut to open a terminal?
10:00	<Sajuukkhar>	alt f2
10:00	<Sajuukkhar>	in gnome
10:00	<Fujisan>	because i have to press reset on my box everytime ubuntu locks up
10:00	<jeffimperial>	preme: make ur own?
10:01	<Sajuukkhar>	u cant use ur mouse either?
10:01	<bazhang>	preme: alt f2 gnome-terminal
10:01	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: i always just put one in the panel
10:01	<Armored_Azrae1>	Anyone know how to make epiphany use kerberos tokens?
10:01	<arstanj>	bahzang: what do you mean?
10:01	<ikonia>	Fujisan: if your kernel panics your locked
10:01	<Armored_Azrae1>	err, not epiphany
10:01	<Armored_Azrae1>	evolution
10:01	<arstanj>	bazhang: it's a server
10:01	<Fujisan>	and it annoys me
10:01	<hang3r>	unop, well it appears to be a little borked in any case, guest account doesn't work and I can't create or write to files in the directory... Time to get dirty with smb.conf again *sigh* :(
10:01	<Myrtti>	Fujisan: remap those keys to launch gnome-system-monitor
10:01	<Ubuntu_4_l1fe>	you have to edit your own shortcuts
10:01	<Divot>	Hi, I'm configuring my xorg.conf manually for a rather complex setup and I was wondering if there was any way of working out what pieces of hardware are on which pci bus. This is for the line: Busid "PCI:1:9:0" for example
10:01	<bazhang>	arstanj: my apologies--perhaps aptitude then
10:01	<finger>	hello, can anybody help me with metacity?
10:01	<MrWGW->	http://pastie.caboo.se/186690
10:01	<preme>	damn I got alot to learn hehe
10:01	<unop>	hang3r, or just modify the permissions on the directory being shared - which is probably what you ought to do anyway.
10:01	<Sajuukkhar>	ok thanks to the guy who gave me that shortcut for the terminal
10:02	<preme>	thanks alot!
10:02	<bazhang>	finger what is your question please specify
10:02	<Sajuukkhar>	u have saved my school work
10:02	<tobmalf>	You should really consider that RAM upgrade... or why not a new machine?. So, I just re-installed Ubuntu, X flavour, latest version... is there a GUI configuration for the fourth and fifth mouse buttons yet?
10:02	<Sajuukkhar>	thank you alot
10:02	<MrWGW->	note that that's just the Ubuntu entry
10:02	<Fujisan>	remap how Myrtti?
10:02	<majikins>	hi - I want to setup a file server for ubuntu clients
10:02	<Fujisan>	i dont know much about linux hence why i am using ubuntu
10:02	<Myrtti>	Fujisan: system - preferences - keyboard shortcuts
10:02	<XceII>	preme:  you could also right click your tray and add to pannel and in accessories youll see an terminal icon
10:02	<Fritzel>	what is the file name that sets what screenlets start at login, the Myip screenlet absolutely refuses not to start
10:03	<tobmalf>	system ->	preferences ->	keyboard shortcuts will let you set a shortcut for the terminal
10:03	<finger>	thx! bazhang: metacity keeps crashing whenever compiz starts
10:03	<Fujisan>	and this will work even when my system locks up Myrtti?
10:03	<majikins>	my googling only seems to come accross articles for windows clients
10:03	<bazhang>	preme: many just add the icon to the channel for easy clicking
10:03	<Fujisan>	just like the reset button?
10:03	<bazhang>	preme sorry I meant panel
10:03	<ikonia>	Fujisan: if your system is hard locked, you need to reset it
10:03	<elkbuntu>	Fujisan, it'll work as well as the windows equivalent works when windows locks up.
10:03	<jeffimperial>	majikins
10:03	<IndyGunFreak>	XceII: oddly enough, that doesn't work w/ hardy
10:03	<Myrtti>	Fujisan: well if it locks, you need to reset it, same with Windows
10:03	<majikins>	is there a server distribution/howto for file server for linux clients
10:03	<majikins>	?
10:03	<XceII>	it did 4 me
10:03	<ikonia>	majikins: what do you want to do
10:04	<Fujisan>	no windows has ctr+alt+delete
10:04	<IndyGunFreak>	XceII: in hardy?.. its not even in the list
10:04	<XceII>	o yes it is
10:04	<majikins>	when clients log in, drive is mapped from file server
10:04	<jeffimperial>	majikins, have u tried adding "ubuntu" at the end of ur keyword string?
10:04	<arstanj>	bazhang: ok I just did apt-get remove --purge apache2
10:04	<Fujisan>	actually my ubuntu locked up more than my vista
10:04	<IndyGunFreak>	XceII: well i must be missing it then.. i just drug it from the accessories menu.
10:04	<preme>	is the panel where by default firefox, Evolution mail and a ? icon is at?
10:04	<ikonia>	majikins: you want to use https://help.ubuntu.com and look at domain server
10:04	<XceII>	i always have one there.
10:04	<Myrtti>	Fujisan: and it's doesn't help at all if it's REALLY locked up
10:04	<Fujisan>	and there is no ctrl+alt+delete function that isnt malicious?
10:04	<ikonia>	majikins: or "auto mount"
10:04	<ikonia>	majikins: depending
10:04	<bazhang>	!vista | Fujisan
10:04	<ubotu>	Fujisan: vista is the new 'operating system' by the evil overlords from Redmond. For more information, see http://www.badvista.org and !windows
10:04	<majikins>	cool - I will try that
10:04	<ikonia>	Fujisan: as you where told yesterady - NO
10:05	<IndyGunFreak>	XceII: i don't know, terminal isn't in my list of add to panel applets, it was in Gutsy, but not in hardy
10:05	<arstanj>	bazhang: then I still see apache2 in etc, so i temp. moved them, but when I try reinstall apache2 it doesn't put /etc/apache2 back
10:05	<MrWGW->	there we go, got it
10:05	<Sajuukkhar>	ok one more question
10:05	<Flannel>	Fujisan: alt-sysreq REISUB
10:05	<tobmalf>	don't you asked this yesterday?. you have got sollution with eval()
10:05	<Fujisan>	who did that?
10:05	<Myrtti>	does it matter
10:05	<Myrtti>	no
10:05	<Fujisan>	i am seeking help and i get the remove
10:05	<Myrtti>	move on
10:05	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: it's working or you have the file
10:05	<bazhang>	Fujisan: stop now please
10:05	<MrWGW->	its working
10:05	<unknownman>	hi friends, i cant find a good mirror for DVD download, do you know any
10:05	<MrWGW->	I posted a link to the file several lines up :-P
10:05	<jeffimperial>	Fujisan, i thought u said that wasnt u
10:05	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: can you explain the issue
10:05	<XceII>	IndyGunFreak:  click application launcher, its in accessories
10:05	<tobmalf>	there is no way either party can get a majority to support a "liberation" of Iran with ground troops
10:05	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: sorry, I missed the link
10:05	<arstanj>	bazhang: so I guess there should be an option to install totally new setup with new configs?
10:06	<preme>	which msn clone messenger do you guys prefer?
10:06	<IndyGunFreak>	XceII: oh ok.. i was used to it being right there.
10:06	<MrWGW->	the boot process seems rather slow though, so it mgiht be stuck
10:06	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: as in what was the problem
10:06	<Sajuukkhar>	actually 2, first one : how do i find my log files from my dapper>hardy update?
10:06	<bazhang>	arstanj: this is odd; that should do it
10:06	<elkbuntu>	tobmalf, not here. this is a support channel not a social or political one
10:06	<MrWGW->	its been at the phase of apparently loading the CD ROM driver for the past 60 seconds or so
10:06	<jeffimperial>	I can't get my upgrade to work for a variety of reasons.. is there any way that i can in some way "automate" the transfer of all my stuff (docs, DLs, folders, torrents, mails, etc.) from Gutsy?
10:06	<m3>	how do I install a wacom bamboo tablet?
10:06	<Sajuukkhar>	2, how do i update though terminal
10:06]  * MrWGW- wonders if Ubiquity failed, just slightly to complete the intall
10:06	<bazhang>	preme: amsn may work or pidgin
10:06	<tobmalf>	my Linux is a little rusty, but login.conf should exist and have a proper value for "openfiles"
10:06	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: I've just checked the last log, your link never came through tot eh channel
10:06	<Sajuukkhar>	m3, you dont :)
10:06	<ikonia>	yes it did
10:06	<tobmalf>	works it came
10:06	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: sorry it did
10:06	<Flannel>	Fujisan: hold alt-sysreq , then type the following: r e i s u b
10:06	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: if you don't use video chat, i'd recommend pidgin..
10:06	<preme>	I have pidgin now works fine but gonna check out aMsn aswell then
10:06	<XceII>	preme:  pidgin is pretty simple
10:07	<Fujisan>	uhm the dark overlord is a saint and philanthropist who doesnt give a free os to the rich western world to make money to give to the kids in Africa it might be me but that vista thing in the bot is rude and i will personally contact the head of Ubuntu Mark Shuttlework ( i am persistent believe me) and address it
10:07	<preme>	ok
10:07	<Fujisan>	thanks
10:07	<Fujisan>	remove me now
10:07	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: why where you using /boot ?
10:07	<arstanj>	bazhang: yeah, purge seems not working, the system still knows that I had apache2 previously, so it's trying to use back old configs(but I moved them)
10:07	<Myrtti>	!offtopic | Fujisan
10:07	<ubotu>	Fujisan: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
10:07	<tobmalf>	I've got to start doing that :/
10:07	<m3>	Sajuukkhar: I hope you have more information than that...
10:07	<Myrtti>	Fujisan: you're fully capable of parting the channel all by yourself
10:07	<eike>	hi, whats the trick to install the ati driver 8.4 in hardy 64?
10:07	<preme>	is there any way to turn off the sound that comes like if Iam using bakspace and there is no characters left to delete it makes a sound
10:07	<IndyGunFreak>	Myrtti: but then nobody would care he left.. :)
10:07	<bashca>	hi there  please  help me on how set wireless networking with  win pc
10:07	<MrWGW->	ikonia, what do you suggest?  I was under the assumption, based on Maxdamantus's comments that /boot was where the default kernels were
10:08	<boeing>	bashca, ##windows
10:08	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, that's correct.
10:08	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: thats correct, but the "root" option (hd0,11) sets grub to where the stage1 files are (/boot) so / should work
10:08	<jeffimperial>	i promise this is the last time i say this
10:08	<Sajuukkhar>	how do i do update from GNOME run>	Terminal?
10:08	<jeffimperial>	I can't get my upgrade to work for a variety of reasons.. is there any way that i can in some way "automate" the transfer of all my stuff (docs, DLs, folders, torrents, mails, etc.) from Gutsy?
10:08	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: /boot is only needed in certain layouts
10:08	<MrWGW->	(hd0,11) is /
10:09	<MrWGW->	at any rate, that doesn't explain why the boot process has mysteriously stopped...
10:09	<bashca>	boeing, am using ubuntu i want to join his home network  using wireless with router ???
10:09	<MrWGW->	do you see anything missing in terms of kernel parameters?
10:09	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: ahhhh ok , sorry
10:09	<myIRC>	just testing...
10:09	<venil>	how come my update manager says "new distribution 7.10 is uvailable", when 8.04 is out, is there any way i can update 7.04 to 8.04 bypassing 7.10
10:09	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: I thought your (hd0,11) was your boot partition
10:09	<MrWGW->	wait, nvm, I see what I left out
10:09	<MrWGW->	nope
10:09	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, try pressing alt + f2 at the beginning of the boot.
10:09	<wild_oscar>	howdi!
10:09	<bazhang>	venil: nay
10:09	<MrWGW->	what does that do?
10:09	<wild_oscar>	could someone have a look at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4782811#post4782811
10:09	<boeing>	bashca, samba
10:09	<keisangi>	hi there.. i'm searching a way to easily display free disk space .. is there's any gnome applet  that can show free space ?
10:09	<wild_oscar>	there seems to be a problem with wireless connections
10:10	<Maxdamantus>	Takes away the boot logo. So you can see text as it boots.
10:10	<wild_oscar>	which someone else has also detected
10:10	<bashca>	i did but stile i cant read  his file  ??
10:10	<venil>	so, i should do 7.10 and then 8.04 will be uvailable??
10:10	<MrWGW->	brb
10:10	<bazhang>	venil: aye
10:10	<XceII>	venil:  ya
10:10	<bashca>	boeing, i did  but stile  i can't read  his file
10:10	<ikonia>	Maxdamantus: apologies didn't mean to step on toes, I was only getting half the info
10:10	<venil>	bazhang: XceII: cheers guys
10:10	<jeffimperial>	keisangi: Applications >	Disk Isage Analyzer (for gutsy at least)
10:11	<XceII>	ok
10:11	<jeanre>	hi all
10:11	<Maxdamantus>	ikonia, you didn't step on my toes.
10:11	<jeanre>	anyone here care to give me a hand with my sound issues
10:11	<ikonia>	Maxdamantus: conflicting information  to wild_oscar
10:11	<ikonia>	oops

10:11	<keisangi>	jeffimperial, this is overkill .. i'm searching more simple thing.. some really simple applet for the gnome panel
10:12	<Sajuukkhar>	how do i install mouse drivers through terminal, anyone?
10:12	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: you don't need mouse drivers
10:12	<Guillaum3>	whats the size on the dist update?
10:12	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: X11 should deal with that
10:12	<ikonia>	Guillaum3: depends on your system
10:12	<Maxdamantus>	tobmalf, wrong channel? ##php\
10:12	<boeing>	tobmalf, u can use system("command") in c++ to do any system-command including manipulated printing
10:12	<Sajuukkhar>	X11 isnt dealing with that
10:12	<tobmalf>	i think utf8
10:12	<Sajuukkhar>	infact its doing nothing
10:12	<Divot>	hi, can hardy support more than two monitors? I understand this may be complicated and hard to set up but I'd like to know just so that I'm not attempting to do something that's actually impossible
10:12	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: why not, whats the problem
10:12	<Maxdamantus>	boeing, it's PHP.

10:13	<Sajuukkhar>	read it
10:13	<boeing>	oh, sry
10:13	<Maxdamantus>	tobmalf, exec() has a similar result to system() in C/C++.

10:13	<MrWGW->	ok, got it
10:13	<MrWGW->	finally
10:13	<Guillaum3>	can we go 'in general'
10:13	<Maxdamantus>	(Or if you have PCNTL loaded, pcntl_exec will basically do the same as system())
10:13	<Guillaum3>	concerning size of the update
10:13	<MrWGW->	I would file a bug report against your Ubiquity installer except that would be too nice :-P

10:32	<guja_nebeska>	ikonia, how to interpret this then:
10:32	<guja_nebeska>	# Mactel PPA
10:32	<guja_nebeska>	deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/mactel-support/ubuntu hardy main
10:32	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, How would I do that, I mean nothing is listening on port 80 anyway
10:32	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: xorg.0.log
10:32	<jeanre>	IndyGunFreak: I have work to do
10:32	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, I don't really see how I could connect
10:32	<Sajuukkhar>	funny thing is, i saw that :\
10:32	<ikonia>	guja_nebeska: thats a source file for dpkg
10:32	<dagon_>	Maxdamantus; really don't know why it fails with any-any too, I so need vmware-server running soon :p
10:32	<Mr>	why wont compiz work for another user when I leave a session opened ???
10:32	<teamcobra>	jeanre: ahh :/ well, upgrade when you're done working, it'll fix the sound
10:32	<guja_nebeska>	ikonia, how to get it?
10:32	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: thats how I was suggesting testing nothing was listening
10:32	<teamcobra>	because I've experienced that one firsthand ;)
10:32	<guja_nebeska>	Go to site and DL-it?
10:32	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: telnet 127.0.0.1 (or ip) 80
10:32	<Maxdamantus>	dagon_, try #vmware
10:33	<ikonia>	guja_nebeska: put it into your /etc/apt/sourcs.list
10:33	<dagon_>	Maxdamantus; I will, thanks ;)
10:33	<brainopia>	How to return from busybox console to installation process?
10:33	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, it says "connection refused"
10:33	<DV8R>	test
10:33	<mbraun_>	Hi there, is it by intention that all files at /var/spool/cyrus and /var/lib/cyrus and /var/lib/cyrus are chowned root:root?
10:33	<bullgard4>	What command line tool will indicate the section to which a certain DEB program package belongs?
10:33	<Kev3124>	﻿does anyone know what the new taskbar icon effects are listed under in compiz? (icon fly out, upon clicking)
10:33	<ikonia>	bullgard4: apt-file ?
10:33	<mbraun_>	at a normal 8.04 installation
10:33	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: seems pretty solid to assume nothing is running
10:34	<tobmalf>	I would like to encrypt a message to then be dissected by my page. I'd use MD5, but how would I deencrypt it? I just want to hide get variable before the user actually gets to the page
10:34	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: if it's a java app, are you trying to use something like tomcat ?
10:34	<Mr-Nilsen>	Need help with WoW, wine and hardy heron .. pm me plx =)
10:34	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, Glassfish actually
10:34	<Tex-Twil>	hello, please can you tell me where can I get help for this kind of substitutions in a script : http://pastebin.com/m7f3af274
10:34	<ikonia>	Mr-Nilsen: people will help in channel when they can
10:34	<mbraun_>	cyrus runns with user cyrus by default, so it's quite braindead to chown the sockets to be unreadable for this user.
10:34	<bazhang>	try #winehq Mr-Nilsen
10:34	<Mr-Nilsen>	ty
10:34	<regis_>	hello,where can i find or what's the command for the Xorg.conf frontend...
10:34	<brainopia>	I'm trying to install ubuntu 8.04 but i hung up at scanning the mirror, what to do?
10:34	<erUSUL>	tobmalf: md5 is a hash not a cipher
10:34	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, So yeah, pretty much like tomcat
10:35	<rockysynergy>	Right now my laptop is using English. How can I set up the ubuntu to enable another user to have Chinese interface?
10:35	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: I'm not familier with glassfish, but this sort of issue used to be common with tomcat, in that apache listening on port 80, tomcat listened on an internal port (say 180) but was served up through apache, could it be something similar in that situation
10:35	<jerzyk86>	hi, when i try to install ubuntu 7.10 after i choose “run or install” ubuntu for a sec my display is turn off, i am waiting because cd-rom is stil copy files but display never is turn on. I have motherboard with integrated graphics but i have in pciexpress grf 8800gt. By integrated graphics its works - i nstall ubuntu on itegrated graph and after i plug my gf, but its still turn off my display when i try to run ubuntu. Any idea how to repair
10:35	<Linus-Trovalds>	 if in a torrent client it shows seeders 7(259) what does the figure within the bracket mean?
10:35	<daning>	rockysynergy: check wiki.ubuntu.org.cn
10:35	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: active ?
10:35	<ikonia>	oops
10:35	<ikonia>	Linus-Trovalds: active seeders
10:36	<teamcobra>	rockysynergy, system/administration/language support?
10:36	<Linus-Trovalds>	and the one outside,i.e. 7?
10:36	<SmokeyD>	anybody can tell me what the "clean up" part of the distro upgrade to Hardy does? Just after all packages have been upgraded.
10:36	<Sajuukkhar>	sigh
10:36	<ikonia>	no, 7 is active 200+ exist
10:36	<IndyGunFreak>	i was thinking the 259 was leechers
10:36	<teamcobra>	rocky: that way, he can change the language to chinese in the gdm login screen
10:36	<bazhang>	rockysynergy: scim for input and language pack to switch interface
10:36	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, as far as I can tell, there really is nothing on port 80
10:36	<ikonia>	SmokeyD: remove old config files, re-run ldoncif g etc etc
10:36	<Sajuukkhar>	i hate this, i copy the log file to my memory stick, i put it in my windows machine and its not there
10:36	<tobmalf>	erUSUL: is generally used as a self-defense device. can do so as a compile time.  you know there's a balance between outright starvation and oppression
10:37	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: exactly, but does glasshouse start a container like apache (as in tomcat used to run within apache)
10:37	<SmokeyD>	ikonia: but the new config files have already been applied during package upgrade right?
10:37	<teamcobra>	Sajuukkhar, make sure you properly unmount the mem stick before you remove it
10:37	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: so the conflict is when started apache is in use
10:37	<teamcobra>	otherwise it'll do that :p
10:37	<SmokeyD>	so just remove .dpk-old files
10:37	<ikonia>	SmokeyD: the ond ones still exist, just general tidy up stuff
10:37	<Sajuukkhar>	how do i do that?
10:37	<ikonia>	SmokeyD: no, more than that as I said in my example
10:37	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia,  no they don't start apache at all, its completely self contained
10:37	<Sajuukkhar>	unmount (name of drive) ?
10:37	<erUSUL>	tobmalf: ??? i'm not sure i understand you
10:37	<sucka>	whats a good ftp program... i used flashfxp for windows is there anything like this for ubuntu?
10:37	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: thats that theory out of the window
10:37	<theunixgeek>	I can't get my screen resolution past 1024 x 768 - I want to get it to 1280 x 1024. how can I do this?
10:37	<x-punk>	has anyone here tried the Flock browser? can you recommend it? having an issue with the font rendering in firefox 3 on hardy
10:37	<SmokeyD>	ikonia: ok, is it a specific script I can read so as to see what has to be done?
10:38	<nikitis>	Question, i'm getting an error 17 from grub.  I just did a fresh install of windows then ubuntu on a separate drives.  upon first boot, i get error 17 which is a cannot mount selected partition error  Anyone know why? or what I can do about it?
10:38	<ikonia>	SmokeyD: no, it's not
10:38	<theunixgeek>	x-punk: isn't flock based off firefox
10:38	<regis_>	anyone...i don't find it
10:38	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, do a re-install of grub
10:38	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: any guides on how to do that
10:38	<x-punk>	theunixgeek: think it is, but seems to look better regarding the fonts
10:38	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: as a suggestion, put a 1 second while look in "while true do "nestat -a | grep LIST | grep 80"; sleep 1 ; done
10:38	<arvind_khadri>	!grub | nikitis
10:38	<ubotu>	nikitis: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
10:39	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: then start it and see if something tries to start on it
10:39	<guja_nebeska>	ikonia, I have upgraded Gutsy to Hardy. But when I do nano /etc/apt/sources list, first line is this:  deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 7.10 _Gutsy Gibbon_ - Release amd64 (20071016)]/ gutsy main$
10:39	<guja_nebeska>	 Why is it still says Gutsy and not Hardy?
10:39	<brainopia>	How to break installation process of Ubuntu?
10:39	<SmokeyD>	ikonia: there is no way of tracing it? No config file, script, etc? It has to be executed somehow.......
10:39	<roffe__>	For some reason I can't get my microphone to work... I can talk in it and I hear my voice in the speaker, but no software can recognize I'm using it...
10:39	<Mr>	WHere is the famous PulseAudio ?? I can't see it running ???
10:39	<ikonia>	guja_nebeska: remove the cd line
10:39	<ikonia>	SmokeyD: check the dpkg.log
10:39	<SmokeyD>	ok, cool
10:39	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, already did that, nothing seems to ever bind to port 80
10:39	<erUSUL>	Mr: ps ax | grep pulse
10:39	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: now thats frustrating
10:39	<tobmalf>	arvind_khadri there was a kde file i could ahve downloaded but didn't, i'll try that and brb
10:40	<guja_nebeska>	ikonia, okay I'll, and how to add that dkpg to sources.list? Just copy-paste at the end of file and save it, or how?
10:40	<arvind_khadri>	tobmalf, ol
10:40	<theunixgeek>	guja_nebeska: what do you mean?
10:40	<arvind_khadri>	tobmalf, s/ol/ok
10:40	<theunixgeek>	guja_nebeska: read the topic: Hardy is OUT :)
10:40	<tobmalf>	erUSUL: see on some dns visionary research. up close to the law.  polygamy is against the law to commit suicide, an old laptop
10:40	<Mr>	erUSUL: but where can I see it visually .... the volume controls for the apps ?
10:40	<theunixgeek>	oh never mind :P
10:40	<DV8R>	t
10:41	<ikonia>	guja_nebeska: thats right
10:41	<rodolfo>	can anyone tell me how to upgrade from 7.10? my image is located on my HD, is there a way to do that without burning on a cd?
10:41	<josh_>	hey is this the right channel to ask for help installing ubuntu?
10:41	<tobmalf>	bug 215442
10:41	<theunixgeek>	guja_nebeska: that's because you upgraded, so synaptic still thinks your original cd is still a reasonable source
10:41	<theunixgeek>	josh_: yes
10:41	<guja_nebeska>	ikonia, okay, let u know if I destroyed something. :)
10:41	<roffe__>	does anyone know why my mic won't get recognized by any program?
10:41	<josh_>	sweet.
10:41	<guja_nebeska>	theunixgeek, but i add stuff to sources.list just by coping text to the EOF and saving it, right_
10:41	<rodolfo>	anyone?
10:42	<theunixgeek>	guja_nebeska: yes
10:42	<josh_>	what partitions do i need to create to install?
10:42	<erUSUL>	Mr: i do not have hardy but the name is pavucontrol pavumeter
10:42	<erUSUL>	Mr: and others
10:42	<tobmalf>	sounds like motorola/freescale
10:42	<Linus-Trovalds>	roffe__, check if ur headphone/speaker is working
10:42	<theunixgeek>	josh_: any partitions
10:43	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: yeah, I can hear my voice in the speakers even, yet no software accepts the sounds
10:43	<josh_>	huh?  i already have two windows partitions and one data partition.
10:43	<Samstone|Junior>	Hi all
10:43	<biabia>	In dmesg it says i need to update driver sd and sr
10:43	<josh_>	so i would like to make it so that i have the kernal separate from my data
10:43	<Samstone|Junior>	Moin!
10:43	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, it seems linux applies some kind of special protection to ports below 1024
10:43	<theunixgeek>	josh_: why?
10:44	<noob-africa>	greetings all my good people!
10:44	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, which means the user needs some specific permissions to access those private ports
10:44	<josh_>	theunixgeek_: so i can change the kernal without losing the data
10:44	<tobmalf>	the exact thing I was looking for, thanks
10:44	<Linus-Trovalds>	roffe__, in mixer, is mic mute?
10:44	<simion314>	Hi i do not like that the browser(Firefox 3 and opera) eat a lot of CPU(20-50%) even they are in background nad with just onle page open(no evident animation or other thing that can indicate the CPU usage). What is happening? can i setup the browser to eat less cpu (to sleep like other programs do)?
10:44	<roffe__>	no
10:44	<noob-africa>	can anyone assist me with this small problem? how do i merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file? what application should i use?
10:44	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: no
10:45	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: I've not seen that
10:45	<gnuskool>	noob-africa: greetings
10:45	<Linus-Trovalds>	roffe__, was ur mic listed in the mixer?
10:45	<josh_>	theunixgeek_:  i already have a data partition, so if i could i'd like to keep my data there.
10:45	<jerzyk86>	hi, when i try to install ubuntu 7.10 after i choose “run or install” ubuntu for a sec my monitor is turn off, i am waiting because cd-rom is stil copy files but display never is turn on. I have motherboard with integrated graphics but i have in pciexpress grf 8800gt. By integrated graphics its works - i nstall ubuntu on itegrated graph and after i plug my gf, but its still turn off my monitor when i try to run ubuntu. Any idea how to repair
10:45	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: yep
10:45	<noob-africa>	Linus-Trovalds: hi! are YOU the great Linus Trovalds?
10:45	<noob-africa>	gnuskool: hi
=== weed is now known as W33D
10:46	<jeanre>	IndyGunFreak: I have no idea now
=== gaurav__ is now known as gaurav_
10:46	<ikonia>	noob-africa: his name isn't Trovalds,
10:46	<noob-africa>	ikonia: yea... it's Torvalds, isnt it?
10:46	<ikonia>	yes
10:46	<noob-africa>	ok... anyone can help me with my simple, yet not so simple problem?
10:47	<josh_>	hey, how big should i make my swap file?
10:47	<IsotropicSpin>	is there an Ubuntu server channel?
10:47	<theunixgeek>	IsotropicSpin: #ubuntu-server
10:47	<IsotropicSpin>	cheers
10:47	<gnuskool>	noob-africa: try http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/
10:47	<arvind_khadri>	josh_, twice the size of your ram
10:47	<theunixgeek>	I want to get my screen resolution to 1280 x 1024. how can I do this?
10:47	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: As I say, I can hear my voice in the speakers, so it must work, but any other software absolutely refuses to acknowledge it
10:47	<noob-africa>	gnuskool: i am there already, thanks, but i dont see where i can download and install PDFTK
10:48	<gan>	bazhang, already it is in deb format wat the path u have given .., but i want the source
10:48	<arvind_khadri>	theunixgeek, go to System->Prefernces->Screen resolutions
10:48	<gnuskool>	noob-africa: http://www.accesspdf.com/article.php/20041130153545577
10:48	<josh_>	arvind_khadri:  what if i have a lot of ram?  do i still need it if i have four GB of RAM?
10:48	<theunixgeek>	arvind_khadri: the option is not there
10:48	<mijac>	do someone has a toshiba sattelite ?
10:48	<noob-africa>	gnuskool: thanks... i already saw the download link...
10:49	<arvind_khadri>	josh_, yeah it is necessary
10:49	<ikonia>	josh_: ram + %15 is areasonable guide
10:49	<ikonia>	josh_: but it's totally personal
10:49	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; type in terminal: xrandr to see what your max. resolution is
10:49	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: twice the size of your ram !
10:49	<arvind_khadri>	theunixgeek, it should be there , i dont know if its not there ...sorry
10:49	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: 1024 x 768
10:49	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: again, stop making random information
10:49	<mijac>	do someone has a toshiba sattelite ?
10:49	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi
10:50	<dany_21a>	where can i set my systemwide keyboard layout (not just for gnome/kde)?
10:50	<josh_>	ikonia:  why does it need about 4.5GB?
10:50	<mijac>	is recognized by the restricted drivers
10:50	<ikonia>	josh_: suspend + overhead
10:50	<mijac>	but does not appears in the networks
10:50	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; if your monitor is able to handle 1280x1024, you cant add the resolution to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
10:50	<ikonia>	josh_: but thats the personal bit
10:50	<TwinX>	can*
10:50	<ikonia>	it depends on your personal situation
10:50	<dwezl>	Hey there.
10:50	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: what do you mean? why can't i?
10:50	<Invert314>	Hardy 8.04 installer doesn't recognize Slamd64 and WindowsXP partitions: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766355
10:50	<TwinX>	typo tehu, you can
10:51	<dwezl>	What do I need to install to watch dvds in hardy?
10:51	<josh_>	ikonia: so what does the swap partition do?
10:51	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: I got it working! I've had issues with it for several weeks since I first downloaded Ubuntu.. but now, I just clicked the mic off and then on again, and it works.. how bizarre
10:51	<ikonia>	josh_: acts as virtual memory
10:51	<jeanre>	ok my sound is really not working
10:51	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi, can someone help me, ?
10:51	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; you can
10:51	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: oh. you said "you cant add...." :P
10:52	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; i'm the king of typos :)
10:52	<ikonia>	josh_: you have a reasonable ammount of swap so if you don't expect to use technologies like suspend, then lower the ammount
10:52	<theunixgeek>	:)
10:52	<TwinX>	:)
10:52	<jeanre>	IndyGunFreak: you got any other ideas
10:52	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: so, how do I add i?
10:52	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi, can someone help me, ?
10:52	<ikonia>	josh_: a reasonable ammount of ram that should read
10:52	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi, can someone help me, ?
10:52	<IndyGunFreak>	jeanre: not really, other than installing Hardy... googling that device though, it doesnt appear your alone
10:52	<Linus-Trovalds>	roffe__, there is only one mic in my system but my sondcrd supports 5 or 6.
10:52	<Linus-Trovalds>	so all are listed
10:53	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; open /etc/X11/xorg.conf with yor favorite editor
10:53	<neuro_>	bah
10:53	<jeanre>	ok going to upgrade to 8.04
10:53	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: I've gotten that far.  :P
10:53	<jeanre>	ok?
10:53	<tobmalf>	I chose it for 6 SATA ports and 2 CPUs, the server is running 4 VMs and processing video content
10:53	<gnuskool>	noob-africa: heres another http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Text-Editing-Processing/Others/PDF-Split-and-Merge-10743.shtml
10:53	<Linus-Trovalds>	roffe__, so i had to actually fig. which one to choose in my new instaalll
10:53	<mijac>	can someone read me ?
10:53	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; section screen
10:53	<theunixgeek>	ok
10:53	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: ok... I got it working though.. I wrote it a bit further up
10:54	<whyking>	hi
10:54	<negge^>	mijac: yeah
10:54	<whyking>	how can I set what modules in /etc/init.d should get started automatically during boot?
10:54	<mijac>	ooh thank god
10:54	<mijac>	thank you negge
10:54	<josh_>	ikonia:  so i basically need the swap file for when i hibernate, right?  then that means i should have a good sized swap if i put ubuntu onto my laptop?
10:54	<negge^>	:D
10:54	<mijac>	well the thing is about the atheros wifi
10:54	<wild_oscar>	if anyone can have a look at why I need to /etc/init.d/networking restart if I want to access LAN's pc's with wireless: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4784811#post4784811
10:54	<ikonia>	josh_: correct hence ram + %15-ish is an acceptable guideline
10:55	<ikonia>	josh_: but it does depend on your pesonal needs/use
10:55	<teamcobra>	Lord: yeah, root needs to open any  <1024 port
10:55	<josh_>	ikonia: does it need to be a separate partiton?
10:55	<gnuskool>	mijac: !ask
10:55	<ikonia>	josh_: double your ram is insane
10:55	<ikonia>	josh_: swap partition is a seperate partition
10:55	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi
10:55	<tobmalf>	 looking in kernel it looks like i have most of the options built in...except for the first and the last. I probably should trim some. ;)
10:55	<mijac>	is recognized by the restricted drivers
10:55	<mijac>	but does not appears in the networks
10:55	<gnuskool>	mijac: state the problem itself
10:55	<SadDreamer>	hello all :)
10:56	<dany_21a>	hello all - where can i set my systemwide keyboard layout (not just for gnome/kde)?
10:56	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: now what?
10:56	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; after saving the file, CTRL ALT BACKSPACE. (no need for reboot)
10:56	<jeanre>	IndyGunFreak: how long does a UPGRADE take?
10:56	<josh_>	ikonia: so if i am installing ubuntu through the installer on the live partition, but i want to manually set the partitions, what do i need?
10:56	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: I didn't do anything to it though
10:56	<jeanre>	how many packages isit
10:56	<nikitis>	Ok, i reinstalled grub using "grub-install /dev/sda" and I'm still getting the error 17
10:56	<ikonia>	josh_: the setup/installer program guides you through it
10:56	<neko>	hi people
10:56	<biabia>	In dmesg it says i need to update driver sd and sr, but i cant find any info on how to do it
10:56	<IndyGunFreak>	jeanre: right now, probabl quite a while, because the servers are bogged down.. the final release was just released yesterday

11:00	<josh_>	ikonia:  i want it to be as small as possible.  i want it to be just the kernal.  i want all applications and data on a separate partition.  if i can...
11:00	<dany_21a>	nikitis: your old grub is still on one, your new on a other drive - your bios loads the wrong drive... try other drives to boot
11:00	<mrjack>	huuh
11:01	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; hold on, you got to remove the # on line 11
11:01	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: I did :)

11:03	<Sajuukkhar>	its cos X11 is fucked
11:03	<Sajuukkhar>	thats why
11:03	<dxdemetriou>	the upgrade from Gutsy to Hardy crashed before it finished and didn't made a cleanup. can I resume it?
11:03	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: that language is uncalled for
11:03	<tobmalf>	quite abit

11:03	<Sajuukkhar>	sorry
11:03	<kyleabaker>	have there been no updates today and yesterday for 8.04? I've been using it for months now and it seems the servers are slow!
11:03	<tobmalf>	you have a better chance at #math
11:03	<bonhoffer>	i was going to make a user a sudoer, by adding them to the admin group
11:04	<bonhoffer>	i imagine if admin does not exist -- then even if i make the group -- they won't be sudoers
11:04	<bonhoffer>	any help? suggestions?
11:04	<noob-africa>	Sajuukkhar: i think u need to dpkg or something like that
11:04	<ikonia>	bonhoffer: why do you not have an admin group
11:04	<josh_>	ikonia: sorry that was really vague.  what is the boot partition for?  what is my bigger partition for?  i already have a data and apps partition for windows.  is there arny way i can put my linux apps and data there?
11:04	<tobmalf>	hi everyone! do you know what are the packages to install the mysql-server??
11:04	<sucka>	how come sending files through amsn never works its so slow??
11:04	<ikonia>	josh_: boot = kernel / = rest, swap = swap
11:04	<kimmey>	tobmalf: mysql-server probably
11:04	<agari>	hi all, i want to figure out why the hardy livecd doesn't detect existing wireless networks
11:05	<bonhoffer>	 sudo adduser me admin produces adduser: The group `admin' does not exist.
11:05	<ikonia>	bonhoffer: why do you not have an admin group
11:05	<Sajuukkhar>	ikonia i will get u that log soon
11:05	<bonhoffer>	i am using a vps -- server

11:06	<bonhoffer>	7.10
11:06	<ikonia>	josh_: no, you can't use the windows data partition
11:06	<ikonia>	josh_: you need a sperate partition for uubntu
11:06	<ikonia>	bonhoffer: contact your provider then, they have removed the admin group
11:07	<bonhoffer>	how do i find the version -- i am looking at the kernal
11:07	<bonhoffer>	kernel
11:07	<bonhoffer>	2.6.18

11:08	<ikonia>	DV8R: either

11:13	<ikonia>	bonhoffer: if you installed this, why does it not have the lsb tools OR the admin group
11:13	<josh_>	ikonia:  easier to back up.  if all my data and programs are on a separate partition, i can just back that up because i don't mind reinstalling my OS's

11:17	<ikonia>	josh_: the partiton sizes are up to YOU. I dont know how big you want your ubuntu install to be, or how your going to use it. The minimum I'd recommend is 4GB, but you should give as much as you feel you can to allow growth

11:19	<slaytanic>	he window contents.
11:19	<nikitis>	JPSmon: i'm trying to dual boot ubuntu and windows.  I installed windows on drive 1, then I installed ubuntu on drive two.  Upon first reboot after ubuntu installs.  I'm getting a GRUB error 17.
11:19	<slaytanic>	How can I get opaque window resizing? When I resize a window I get a horrible blue transparent rectangle instead of the window contents.
11:19	<ikonia>	josh_: applications are split out across many directorys and mount points, for example apache web server, that is has the binaires (application) installed in /usr/bin, the config files are held in /etc, the log files are held in /var, to follow what you want, you'd have to have seperate partitions for /usr /var and /etc (you can't have a parttiion for /etC)
11:20	<nikitis>	menu.lst looks correct to me
11:20	<ikonia>	josh_: it's not like windows where everything is stored in program files
11:21	<josh_>	ikonia:  so there's no way i can have my programs on a separate partition from ubuntu(the OS)?  i can't the home directory on the data partiton along with everything else but the OS?
11:21	<Zasch>	Hello. I'm trying to upgrade right now, and it asks me what I want to do about menu.lst. Thing is, I don't know what I want to do :P

11:23	<ikonia>	josh_: what your talking about is all the tools around it
11:23	<jtravnick>	Zasch, menu.lst is part of your grub i believe i told it to replace mine
11:23	<ifireball>	josh_: As far as Ubunto goes the programs and the "OS" are parts of the same thing, you use the same tools to maintain and install them, etc.

11:25	<ikonia>	josh_: eg: firefox is linked into gnome, which is your desktop
11:25	<Boredom_inc>	Does anybody know how to enable PDF viewing in firefox other than through the Adobe plugin?
11:25	<Tech>	hm, wow, got as far as installing an irc client, go me

11:26	<josh_>	ikonia:  so you're saying that the desktop is almost like an application in windows?  that it's separate from the OS?

11:28	<sCOTTo>	JPSmon: it says it cant resolvemy hostname...
11:28	<josh_>	ikonia:  so i should think of ubuntu as separate from my OS, which would be linux, and think of ubuntu as just a nice set of packaged applications for linux?
11:28	<JPSmon>	sCOTTo: I have _no_  idea.  that little thing worked for me in 7.10.    I have no idea what it means
11:28	<JPSmon>	resolve your hostname?
11:28	<sCOTTo>	weird... im stuck... might have to copy a backup and do a frsh install...
11:29	<ikonia>	josh_: forget it, think of ubuntu as "linux" and you need it all on one partition
11:29	<ifireball>	<josh_>	ikonia:  so you're saying that the desktop is almost like an application in windows?  that it's separate from the OS? <- yes, it can be replaced or removed altogether, though it, it itself is not a single application but a multitude of applications
11:29	<sCOTTo>	JPSmon: yeah
11:29	<Boredom_inc>	ikonia: Linux is a kernel. It is responsible for the core jobs, such as interfacing with hardware and managing which applications have access to the CPU. This is what all operating systems do. Ubuntu is a package of software/applications/binaries that run on the linux kernel. GNOME is the GUI (graphical user interface) much like windows uses Explorer.

11:32	<JPSmon>	timo we try what's up?
11:32	<ikonia>	jrib: I'm putting a bug togheter on this, it's quite common now as it resolves agaisnt hostname rather than localhost, so any dhcp clients are not going to have hostname setup correctly
11:32	<josh_>	ifireball:  i have my windows set up so that all my windows programs and data are on a separate partition(that i back up about twice a week).  i was hoping i could put all my linux data and applications on it as well
11:32	<sCOTTo>	jrib: it doesnt have faithtop in hosts.

11:33	<makkbe>	josh_: unlearn what you've learned about windows when using linux :)

11:33	<timo>	JPSmon failsafe gnome
11:33	<ikonia>	jrib: I don't know, it appears that sudo is attemping to resolve on gethostbyname()
11:33	<makkbe>	Tech_: irssi
11:33	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You can do that if you want. It will work but it's no advisable... It's probably a better idea to put your home directory on the partition that you backup. The home directory contains things like the linux equivalent of My Documents.
11:33	<ifireball>	josh_: there is little reason to back up the Linux applications since they can be easily reinstalled with the package manager anyway, WRT to the data, just back up your home directory
11:33	<ikonia>	jrib: I'm not sure if its the same actual bug as the general failure
11:33	<JPSmon>	timo dont know about the failsafe gnome
11:33	<makkbe>	with plugins for nicklist

11:35	<sCOTTo>	jrib: no - and i DIDNT put it there either! but the prob is that I Cant get root :)
11:36	<makkbe>	inditech: put the module in /etc/modules
11:36	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You can make a folder on your partition that you backup... call it home... you can mount this as the linux default home directory... home is like Windows 'Documents and Settings'
11:36	<jrib>	sCOTTo: are you sure?  That's how it is in the pastebin

11:37	<icqnumber>	makkbe, wrong guess!
11:37	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok, so how much space can a linux partition require?  and is the package manager in my home directory, so that if my home directory is on the data partition it will be backed up?
11:37	<makkbe>	icqnumber: then i do not know

11:39	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Things like settings, for programs and such
11:39	<timo>	arvind_khadri: yes
11:39	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Or do you mean the specific directories
11:39	<ifireball>	josh_: for a home machine I think a 5GB partition for the OS/Applications would suffice and you should place /home on your data partition and make it as big as possible (so you can have a lot of room for your data)

11:40	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: not "sudo"
11:40	<ifireball>	josh_: since your home directory also contains all your personal settings, backing it enough is enough to get back a fully working system after a reinstall and a restore
11:40	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  so all my program data(preferences, documents(if i'm using a word eqivalent), etc) will automagically go into my home directory?
11:41	<arvind_khadri>	ikonia, ok sorry a BIG MISTAKE,what do you want me to do
11:41	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: think about what your saying to people
11:41	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: as I keep asking you
11:41	<jrib>	icqnumber: nope, it's not suppose to do that.  Make sure you verified it using the option you are given when you boot the cd

11:45	<nikitis>	i'm about to start swearing.  i've been up for 24 hours straight trying to figure out this grub issue
11:45	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: If your used to backing up a partition all the time I recommend making a partition that is just your home directory... you then mount this folder in ubuntu and it is accessed a bit like a folder.... its at the location /home .... If you create a partition I can tell you how to make the partition mount at /home every time ubuntu boots up
11:45	<timo>	I have a back up should i restore. Seems the upgrade was not successful.
11:45	<icqnumber>	ikonia, after i select 'try ubuntu without any change to your computer', the first screen appear, is a log in screen!
11:45	<josh_>	ifireball:  i don;t actually have that much.  i just have no idea how much space linux programs take compared to windows.
11:45	<ikonia>	icqnumber: and thats the gnome login screen ?
11:45	<mrjack>	josh_: this depends absolutly on the program
11:46	<ifireball>	josh_: like I said, 5GB should be enough, as long as you make a separate /home partition

11:47	<dexter>	not a good idea the Firefox 3 in hardy
11:47	<panda>	josh_: generally much less space ...
11:47	<nikitis>	Getting GRUB error 17, Grub bootloader is on /dev/sda as well as my windows partition.  /dev/sdb is where menu.lst is located and my /boot and linux partitions.  Any ideas why?
11:47	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You will probably find that you don't need as many programs on linux as windows. Linux programmers are quite adept at sharing libraries (in windows these are dll folders) so one program uses the features of many libraries. Pidgin is a good example (mind you it only uses a few libraries) but it works as a AIM, IRC, MSN, Yahoo (and more) client
11:47	<josh_>	panda:  thanks; that's what i was looking for.
11:47	<vistakiller>	slaytanic you run compiz?

11:48	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, did you try re-installing the grub
11:48	<ifireball>	josh_: my current root partition (where the OS and all the programs are) currently has 2.2GB used and 3GB free after years of using the system, so 5GB should be enough
11:49	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: i typed grub-install /dev/sda  It said it reinstalled but i still get the same error

11:49	<Stred>	Hello... Ubuntu newbie Q1: I'm running a Live CD on an XP system. Ubuntu is not recognizing my dual monitors (Nvidia FX5200), only one. Could there be an easy fix or would I have to install Ubuntu  first before trying to install new video drivers?   Thanks!
11:49	<josh_>	eckesicle:  sorry.  ok, so i really only need about 5GB of space.
11:49	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: my computer has been hanging on that message for half an hour
11:50	<immesys>	stred: yeah, you would probably have to install
11:50	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, you need to follow some steps before that
11:50	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: such as?
11:50	<eckesicle>	josh_, I am a power user. Games will naturally take up more space
11:50	<samalex>	Dues Ubuntu 8.04 server have some firewall enabled that doesn't allow IP's beyond the local subnet connect?  I've estup Ubuntu 8.04 server with apache and SSH, and even though I can hit them from other computers on the local network, I'm unable to hit it from the Internet, even though that system is setup as DMZ in router and GRC.com's Shields Up does show ports 80 and 22 open.
11:50	<Stred>	thank you immesys
11:50	<samalex>	just curious ...
11:50	<josh_>	ifireball:  i feel like i should send microsfot my bill for the giant harddrvie i needed to buy
11:50	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: if u know where the upgrade log is, I can check if the message was the same
11:50	<eckesicle>	josh_, sorry for repeat.
11:50	<SoulChild>	Third mouse button on tocupad, pressing first and second does not work anymore,... any ideas ???
11:50	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, loacating where it is...check out this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
11:50	<immesys>	stred: unless you remaster a live cd. This is not an easy task though
11:51	<eckesicle>	then on the other hand i keep 500GB of media. So linux will not decompress that for you :)
11:51	<josh_>	ecksicle:  ok, is there a way to keeo linux separate from ubuntu so i can try installing other linux flavors?
11:51	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: I cannot do that.  When i type grub in the commandline after "SU" it comes back with a terminal error
11:51	<Stred>	immesys not likely to remaster a CD, thanks :)
11:51	<eckesicle>	so you might want to keep your harddrive
11:51	<eckesicle>	josh_ what do you mean?
11:51	<timo>	can i have some guidance please http://pastebin.com/m3d047985
11:51	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, its sudo
11:51	<ifireball>	josh_: maybe... but they're not the only one to blame, I find the windows programmers tend to be inefficient space-wise for various reasons (like not sharing components for example)
11:52	<eckesicle>	You can have different flavours on different partitions if you like, or virtualise.
11:52	<josh_>	ifireball:  </>joke</>
11:52	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: found the log. it's the same message
11:52	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: that's assuming I can get into a linux session correct?
11:52	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: d/w I fixed it. Seems like it's a known bug with gnome
11:52	<banshe>	how do i remove a file extension,say .url from all files in a directory?
11:52	<ifireball>	josh_: for your last question, that's just asking for trouble, and make little sense
11:52	<immesys>	timo: replacing with package maintainers version is usually okay
11:52	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: but my upgrade continued
11:52	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, be on a live ubuntu cd and do this
11:52	<icqnumber>	ikonia, not way to make a screen shot, tty1 says: "user not known to the underlying authentication module"!
11:52	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: it continued as well?
11:52	<timo>	thanks
11:52	<simion314>	anyone use no-script with firefox? i have a problem
11:52	<jrib>	banshe: one way is to use the 'rename' command (see its man page for examples)
11:52	<Jookia>	Hi guys
11:52	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: after quite a while it did
11:52	<josh_>	ifireball:  so what should i do if i want to have two separate linux distros?
11:52	<arvind_khadri>	banshe, use rename
11:53	<banshe>	ok
11:53	<amerio>	why I try to use sudo to install a package I get that "timestamp too far in the future:..."
11:53	<Boredom_inc>	Ubuntu comes with (by default) all most everything you need... CD/DVD burning software, bittorrent client, music player, office software, web browser, messenger client, PDF viewer, image manipulation software... The only software people really install (other than changing the default programs) is Programming environments and games... Games take up a huge amount of space obviously so you need to leave room on the ubuntu (not home) partition for games and c
11:53	<ikonia>	icqnumber: I can't explain that
11:53	<Glas`Awyr>	Question #1: Once my install finishes on my laptop and I have rebooted, I want to install an IRC client before I do anything else. I've only ever used mIRC on Windows and would like something similar. Any suggestions?
11:53	<ifireball>	josh_: just install them on separate partitions, you can sometimes share the home partition, but it may not work all that well
11:53	<Jookia>	Glas
11:53	<arvind_khadri>	Glas`Awyr, xchat
11:53	<josh_>	Boredom_inc: what games?
11:53	<Jookia>	I'm using IRC on pidgin
11:53	<wild_oscar>	Glas`Awyr: pidgin
11:53	<oaihs>	howdy
11:54	<Jookia>	HOWDY
11:54	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok, thanks.
11:54	<[T]-Rex>	check out irssi
11:54	<wild_oscar>	Glas`Awyr: pidgin works with irc, msn, gtalk, yahoo, etc
11:54	<icqnumber>	this massage appears, 1o times, after "loading, please wait", can not even use tty1
11:54	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: What do you mean by 'what games?'
11:54	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, ??
11:54	<Glas`Awyr>	I tried pidgin while using running from the Live CD and hated it. I'll take a look AT xChat.
11:54	<wild_oscar>	Glas`Awyr: although, if u're used to msn, I strongly suggest amsn for that
11:54	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  what games can you(do you) play on linux?  or are you just using Wine?  and how much space do you need?
11:55	<crashanddie>	josh_, same space as windows game
11:55	<Jookia>	Hey guy, I'm in a position so tight I might aswell be on 4chan
11:55	<samalex>	n/m, stupid Linksys router had some firewall enabled by default.
11:56	<_Rambaldi_>	josh_, nexuiz, openarena, are the ones i play (both like Unreal)
11:56	<lclimber>	hello everyone, i am havin a proble with my just upgraded ubuntu system, it doesn't seem to recognize my headphones
11:56	<Jookia>	lclimber
11:56	<mOrO^>	Help! Im looking at a screen that is about 20 times bigger than it is supposed to be.
11:56]  * arvind_khadri nexuiz is really awesome
11:56	<josh_>	_rambaldi:  how much space do they take up?
11:56	<banshe>	can someone tell me how to use rename? I am unable to understand the manpage
11:56	<icqnumber>	ikonia, this massage appears 1o times, after "loading, please wait", can not even use tty1, i have another distro installed on this box, does it makes a sence, actually not, well then the official mirror i got it from?
11:56	<crashanddie>	josh_, other than that, most games that are OpenGL based are Linux compatible (UT comes to mind, Quake, etc) Wine allows you to run Windows based games, by wrapping the API it needs. It's been a long time ever since I used wine, but support wasn't that bad
11:56	<unocrash>	hey
11:56	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I don't play games really but there are a surprisingly large amount of linux games. Not all that many AAA titles but there are a lot of native games that are very good. Otherwise you can just use Wine and run the games straight off your windows partition
11:56	<unocrash>	im just upgrading
11:56	<Jookia>	I have a problem; I'm running off my live CD, transfering my backups to a 1GB flash drive and I need to burn a CD. What should I do?
11:57	<_Rambaldi_>	i never really checked josh_ the package was about 240mb
11:57	<crashanddie>	Jookia, once you're booted, you should be able to eject the CD
11:57	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  so would i need more than 5GB if i wanted to install a bunch of games?
11:57	<Xiliath>	anyone tried hildon on hardy?
11:57	<[^martin]>	Hi all, I've just got my Ubuntu install up and running and have connected succesfully to my wireless network. I am having trouble connecting to specific endpoints that other machines on the network are not. For example, www.mozilla.org works. www.google.com does not. How would I go about troubleshooting this?
11:57	<Jookia>	Martin
11:57	<Jookia>	Goto about:config
11:57	<Jookia>	And find IPv6
11:57	<Jookia>	In the search bar
11:58	<immesys>	martin: try turning off ipv6
11:58	<Jookia>	And set that to true
11:58	<[^martin]>	ah
11:58	<FloodBot2>	Jookia: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
11:58	<crashanddie>	josh_, yeah, definitely
11:58	<[^martin]>	ok, 2 secs
=== icesword is now known as mademelaugh
11:58	<dreamcoder>	any reccomend what to install ubuntu or kubuntu?
11:58	<Jookia>	Ubuntu is best
11:58	<Jookia>	But if you come from windows
11:58	<tiramisu>	dreamcoder: you can install kde on ubuntu
11:58	<Jookia>	Get Kubuntu
11:58	<mosno>	Gnome Menu icons are blank for newly installed GTK+ applications (installed via aptitude on 8.04) -- anyone know what the issue is here?
11:58	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, depends on what you like most, if you prefer KDE or Gnome
11:58	<Jookia>	Or if you come from Mac
11:58	<josh_>	crashanddie:  how much would you recommend?
11:58	<banshe>	it is dependent on ur taste
11:58	<Jookia>	Use Ubuntu
11:58	<_Rambaldi_>	what happened to ubuntu-bots
11:58	<immesys>	dreamcoder: kubuntu looks nicer but I'm having grief installing it, so use ubuntu rather
11:58	<amerio>	guys the wireless driver exists but wireless doesnt work please help
11:59	<Jookia>	Amerio
11:59	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I recommend allocating about 4 GB (ubuntu) + 5 GB (or less for games)... Because by the sounds of it you intend to play windows games and I assume they are already installed on your windows partition, you don't need to reinstall them on linux
11:59	<Jookia>	My friend had this problem
11:59	<tiramisu>	ubuntu should be used even if you want kde since kubuntu is dependency hell
11:59	<Jookia>	Disable IPv6
11:59	<banshe>	can someone tell me how to use rename? I am unable to understand the manpage
11:59	<lclimber>	hello everyone, i am havin a proble with my just upgraded ubuntu system, it doesn't seem to recognize my headphones
11:59	<crashanddie>	josh_, I don't know, depends on the games you want to play... Take about 10Gig for WoW, 12Gig for a normal CS/HL2/CS:S install
11:59	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Mind you not all of them will run
11:59	<amerio>	Jookia how to disable IPV6?
11:59	<dreamcoder>	ok will try ubuntu thanks
11:59	<osfameron>	tiramisu: I thought kubuntu was just ubuntu+kde_desktop ?
11:59	<Jookia>	I'm not sure how globaly.
11:59	<Jookia>	But there's a firefox config
12:00	<Xiliath>	osfameron, it basicly is, but some applications are different
12:00	<banshe>	lclimber, thats y u should not use upgrade.
12:00	<crashanddie>	tiramisu, please don't spawn ideas like that, thank you
12:00	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  they aren't installed yet;  is there a way to install the games on a separate hard drive from ubuntu?
12:00	<Jookia>	Yes
12:00	<crashanddie>	josh_, of course, mount that drive to your filesystem, and install them there
12:00	<tehgeek>	Oh em gee.  The package servers seem uber-bogged down.  T_T
12:00	<Ubuntu2008>	amerio, do you know the make of your wi-fi card?
12:00	<ifireball>	crashanddie: shouldn't those games be installed to some other partition, say /usr/local or /opt ?
12:00	<Jookia>	Tehgeek: That's cause of 8.04 upgrades.
12:00	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: What type of headphones? USB or standard headphone jack?
12:00	<crashanddie>	josh_, you might need to setup a new wine_C_drive, and set it to that given mount point
12:01	<tehgeek>	Jookia, Yeah, I figured.  Still is a bummer.  =X
12:01	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: sorry, i'm trying it now
12:01	<obnibolongo>	amerio, Jookia, you can always blacklist kernel module ipv6 in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
12:01	<ele_Acaro>	SALVE A TUTTI ------------------------------
12:01	<[^martin]>	Jookia: disabled that IPV6 in Firefox, still no luck. It gets to "Waiting for host..." and just hangs there. Definitely a firefox issue though - just tried telnetting to the host
12:01	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, thats ok
12:01	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc standard
12:01	<josh_>	crashanddie: no idea what that meant, but that's ok, i just wanted to know if it was possible.
12:01	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 Atheros AR242x
12:01	<ele_Acaro>	HI TO ALL -----------------------
12:01	<NekoKun>	Is there any ubuntu distro that is minimalist? Just kernel + basic commands, not including any GUI, just basic drivers? Like an 'apt-get' version... that anything extra than the most needed stuff must be downloaded...
12:01	<Jookia>	Where would I go about finding my firefox bookmarks file?
12:01	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: So it's not using the correct sound card then
12:01	<obnibolongo>	lol hi ele_Acaro
12:01	<crashanddie>	josh_, if you're going to install wine based games, Wine is going to create a virtual Windows drive (filesystem), just save that virtual drive on the other hard disk, so you can use that space
12:02	<obnibolongo>	NekoKun, Gentoo Linux? :P
12:02	<makkbe>	NekoKun: the server version is pretty basic
12:02	<makkbe>	if you want ubuntu
12:02	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 and its enabled and in Use
12:02	<makkbe>	otoh, debian netinstall is even more basic
12:02	<arvind_khadri>	NekoKun, that would be gobuntu
12:02	<NekoKun>	makkbe: How many gbs it needs to install?
12:02	<crashanddie>	NekoKun, you could also try Arch Linux
12:02	<jPratt>	I dont see any differences really in 8.04
12:02	<makkbe>	NekoKun: under 600 mb
12:02	<ele_Acaro>	I FORGOTTEN THAT HERE IT'S USED ONLY ENGLISH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12:02	<josh_>	crashanddie: ok, so does a swap file of 5GB(i have 4 gb ram) and a Ubuntu partition of 5GB sound reasonable?
12:03	<NekoKun>	Well, so far Debian EeeOS is the best option... mmm < 600mb
12:03	<crashanddie>	but yeah, I'd recommend the netinstall of Debian as makkbe said
12:03	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: stop with the caps
12:03	<ifireball>	josh_: why don't you go ahead and install? I think you'd have a fairly good grasp of the answers to all your questions within a month... and if you get it wrong the 1st time, just go ahead and reinstall, its fairly painless
12:03	<obnibolongo>	ele_Acaro, don't use caps, it's considered yelling
12:03	<neeto>	In 7.10, when I clicked on things in the system tray, it would switch to whatever workspace the corresponding window was on... it doesn't seem to do that anymore. How do I make it so that it does?
12:03	<ele_Acaro>	excuse me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12:03	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Type "cat /proc/asound/modules" in terminal and check to see your soundcard (that the headphones are plugged in) is listed
12:03	<NekoKun>	What's the main difference between debian and ubuntu?
12:03	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: and the exclamation marks as well, please
12:03	<crashanddie>	josh_, I'd say 5Gb is a bit minimalistic, to be honest, I'd shrink the swap to 2 gig, and give the 3 extra gig to your root
12:03	<ifireball>	josh_: at 4GB ram your should have about 4GB swap
12:03	<dagon_>	ele_Acaro; abuse of ! is also considered rude
12:03	<makkbe>	NekoKun: ubuntu is a customized debian
12:04	<neeto>	NekoKun: honestly? Sexiness.
12:04	<mademelaugh>	really
12:04	<makkbe>	one can say
12:04	<mademelaugh>	!swap
12:04	<ubotu>	swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
12:04	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc it says 0 snd_hda_intel
12:04	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc that's it
12:04	<makkbe>	NekoKun: debian generally use older packages in their stable versions
12:04	<josh_>	ifireball: about?
12:04	<crashanddie>	mademelaugh, I wouldn't use 4gig swap on any desktop computer that has 4Gig of ram... He'll never use it :/
12:04	<NekoKun>	makkbe: So, in a way I could say that doing the correct patches/kernel I could get a debian install and turn it into a ubuntu?
12:04	<ele_Acaro>	am i bad for you ?
12:05	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 ?
12:05	<neeto>	In 7.10, when I clicked on things in the system tray, it would switch to whatever workspace the corresponding window was on... it doesn't seem to do that anymore. How do I make it so that it does?
12:05	<NekoKun>	Ok... I hate old things :p
12:05	<banshe>	how do i remove a file extension,say .url from all files in a directory?
12:05	<crashanddie>	NekoKun, you can always try Debian sid
12:05	<makkbe>	NekoKun: if you use one of the newer debian branches, yes
12:05	<mademelaugh>	crashanddie, yep, wise choice
12:05	<makkbe>	sid or lenny
12:05	<ifireball>	josh_: partition sizes, what installs where, games, etc.
12:05	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: go to System ->	Preferences ->	Sound and press test for something other than capture... you should hear a beeping noise (you may have already tried this)
12:05	<makkbe>	lenny is probably recommended
12:05	<makkbe>	sid is really unstable from time to time
12:05	<mademelaugh>	what
12:05	<mademelaugh>	isn't here ubuntu
12:06	<Jookia>	How would I go about accessing my /home/jookia/.Trash folder ON ANOTHER HARDDRIVE
12:06	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Let me know if you heard anything
12:06	<crashanddie>	Jookia, where did you mount it ?
12:06	<josh_>	ifireball:  i heard a swap file 1.15 times the size of your RAM was a good amount; is that too much?  if it's just virtual memory, does it ever need to be a bigger size than my RAM?
12:06	<Jookia>	disk-1
12:06	<ele_Acaro>	i would like learn more from you but i like much not be a problem for you !
12:06	<crashanddie>	Jookia, that's not a valid mount point
12:06	<amerio>	obnibolongo so disabling VP6 would make my wireless work?
12:06	<crashanddie>	Jookia, a mount point is something like /media/disk1, or /mnt/mydisk
12:06	<josh_>	ifireball:  this is installing on my laptop, btw
12:06	<ifireball>	NekoKun: you can say that about any Linux distro, doesn't make sense time-wise to do stuff that way though
12:06	<NekoKun>	I'm asking that cause I have an EeePC, and want something like eeeXUbuntu... but IMHO it has too much garbage installed....
12:06	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: just ask whatever you want to know then
12:06	<Kirby>	is ubuntu supposed to be slower than windowsxp ?
12:07	<mrjack>	if you boot ubuntu with low graphics, eg xdriver not installed correctly, ubuntu starts with 800x600 - in that resolution, the update-manager and many other programs are using more than 600px in height, but they cant be resized making it impossible for the user to klick the ok or next button...
12:07	<arvind_khadri>	ikonia, i would like you to read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#head-ca3b215130839e9b2e1c85af31620153daba975c
12:07	<Jookia>	/media/disk-1
12:07	<makkbe>	NekoKun: do you want a gui?
12:07	<neeto>	Kirby: are you a troll or are you honest?
12:07	<mademelaugh>	Kirby, not really, you cannot compare mem management with xp
12:07	<NekoKun>	makkbe: I plan to instal xfce later, but I don't want kde/gnome uneeded files around
12:07	<makkbe>	ok
12:07	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: If you have lots of RAM your swap file will rarely be used but as a general rule a swap file roughly the size of your ram is good
12:07	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc yes, i have sound, the proble is that it dosen't redirect the sound to my headphones when i plug them
12:07	<obnibolongo>	amerio, I don't know, I though you'd asked how to disable IPv6, I told you how, I didn't know what was leading to it, sorry
12:07	<Kirby>	well my ubuntu is certainly slower than windowsxp
12:07	<mademelaugh>	Kirby, when refer to linux, it cannot be very fast, but it is stable, it just works
12:07	<Paavi2_0>	Kirby: yes and no. some things are much faster and some things you'd think to be slower
12:07	<crashanddie>	josh_, 4Gigs of RAM is quite an enormous amount, I doubt you'll ever need all of it. I seriously doubt you'll ever need more than 4Gig, your swap would probably never be used
12:07	<makkbe>	then i suggest a debian lenny or arch
12:08	<neeto>	NekoKun: I am coming into the middle of this conversation, but if you don't want gnome/kde, why not just use xubuntu?
12:08	<finek>	hi
12:08	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  thanks
12:08	<crashanddie>	josh_, you need swap "to be safe", but 2gigs of swap is by far enough with the enormous quantity of RAM you have access to
12:08	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	my wireless driver is enabled and in use but no wireless , do u have ny idea about that?
12:08	<ifireball>	josh_: the rule of thumb is that up to 2GB swap = ram*2; beyond 2GB its swap=ram; and beyond 4GB it doesn't mater... too much swap can cause trashing, though I doubt the swap will even get used on a 4GB desktop machine
12:08	<arvind_khadri>	Boredom_inc, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#head-ca3b215130839e9b2e1c85af31620153daba975c
12:08	<dagon_>	neeto; or fluxbuntu ;)
12:08	<tyranos>	hi everyone , what do i need to install to get  my fn keys to work on my laptop
12:08	<NekoKun>	neeto: I've installed it and found good sized KDE and gnome folders on it
12:08	<NekoKun>	also, it uses a LOT of space
12:08	<case_>	Kirby, ubuntu can be seen as slower than winxp, as winxp si slower than dos... you have to compare the features too...
12:08	<josh_>	crashanddie:  what about when i hibernate/sleep?  (i'm on a laptop that i use for school)
12:08	<tehgeek>	tyranos, You need to hit the fn-lock key maybe?
12:08	<tehgeek>	:P
12:09	<mademelaugh>	coz you know, harddisk 's speed cannot compare with memrory
12:09]  * arvind_khadri screams its mentioned it the official forums too that have twice the size of your ram as swap
12:09	<ruewan>	hi
12:09	<neeto>	NekoKun: well to run most apps you need some gtk/kde stuff, like any python programs or amarok, which is kde...
12:09	<finek>	what can i do when only one of speakers works and another one isnt?
12:09	<Kirby>	I am talking about GUI, gui in ubuntu is slower than in windows xp- browsing files, opening jpgs, text...
12:09	<crashanddie>	josh_, swap isn't used at that point
12:09	<ruewan>	i just instaled hardy
12:09	<neeto>	dagon_: flux is icky
12:09	<Jookia>	 /media/disk-1/home/jookia/.Trash = permission denied.
12:09	<ruewan>	my hard drive has been going nonstop since i installed it
12:09	<obnibolongo>	amerio, well, which wireless card do you have?
12:09	<Kirby>	case_: what features???
12:09	<josh_>	ifireball: thanks.
12:09	<dagon_>	neeto; can't be worse than xfce
12:09	<finek>	Jookia, sudo
12:09	<crashanddie>	Jookia, because you mounted it and don't have write perms on the mount point
12:09	<Jookia>	how do I sudo thefile browser?
12:09	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	Atheros AR242x
12:09	<neeto>	dagon_: that's where you're wrong good sir.
12:09	<NekoKun>	dagon_: Why 'worse than xfce'?
12:10	<dagon_>	Jookia; sudo nautilus
12:10	<obnibolongo>	amerio, ouch...
12:10	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Are your speakesr built-in or are they plugged into a different soundcard?
12:10	<josh_>	ifireball:  do you think a 2GB swap would be fine as well?
12:10	<dagon_>	NekoKun; never liked xfce
12:10	<case_>	Kirby, about gui features, 3d desktop, font antialiasing, file preview, vector icons... etc...
12:10	<dagon_>	neeto; okey :p
12:10	<crashanddie>	Jookia, mount /media/disk-1 -o remount,rw,umask=0 or something like that, check the man page
12:10	<Kirby>	can I make ubuntu faster, disabling its so called features?
12:10	<tyranos>	thegeek , thx i ll try it
12:10	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	not supported?
12:10	<finek>	what can i do when only one of speakers works and another one isnt?
12:10	<Jookia>	Kirby is a troll. I'm sure.
12:10	<neeto>	http://noisefrombelow.com/images/sshots/clean.jpg
12:10	<james__>	Anyone else having audio problems? Mine sounds VERY grainy. This because of Pulse Audio?
12:10	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc they are built in, its a laptop
12:10	<NekoKun>	dagon_: I never liked gnome... can't explain why...
12:10	<obnibolongo>	amerio, don't know, I had problems with an atheros a while ago, checking which one was
12:10	<tyranos>	tehgeek, but the volume up key works
12:10	<ifireball>	josh_: depends on what you're gonna be running, but generally with 4GB ram, yeah.
12:10	<flithm>	hey everyone, I just installed 8.04 here, and I don't get any 3d acceleration (nvidia) like I did with gutsy... anyone know what's going on?  The hardware drivers utility says it's detected "nvidia_new" but it's not in use
12:10	<neeto>	xfce is not ugly in the least
12:10	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: 2GB might even be a bit excessive but there is no harm in having one too big as long as you can spare the harddisk space
12:11	<case_>	Kirby, you sould try Xubuntu if you have an old hardware. less features, less needs.
12:11	<Glas`Awyr>	Trolls are usually looking for cybersex... ahem...
12:11	<josh_>	boredom_inc:i'd rather be safe than sorry.
12:11	<Glas`Awyr>	xChat looks like what I'm looking for. Thanks #Ubuntu.
12:11	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	used to work on gutsy ! but I made a fresh install for hardy and stopped working =)
12:11	<dagon_>	NekoKun; okey.. well xfce to me.. is too lightweight
12:11	<Kirby>	though when scrolling pdf it;s superfast in ubuntu, I couldn't find such fast pdf viewer in windows
12:11	<case_>	Kirby, but Xubuntu comes with XFCE as Desktop manager, not Gnome...
12:11	<josh_>	ifireball:  what would/might require a bigger swap?
12:11	<ruewan>	how do i tell what process is reading my hard drive
12:11	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, so how many ram
12:11	<finek>	how to reinstall audio drivers?
12:12	<ifireball>	Boredom_inc: actually there is harm in that, but not in a desktop scenario I guess
12:12	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd.
12:12	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; one
12:12	<inspired>	I just installed hardy. with desktop effects enabled the window titlebar is missing when a window loses focus. using an nvidia graphics card. anyone else seeing this?
12:12	<ele_Acaro>	!addon
12:12	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about addon - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
12:12	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, how many megabytes
12:12	<ifireball>	josh_: a heavily loaded server software like a database for example
12:12	<obnibolongo>	amerio, first of all, let me warn you, I told you that thing about IPv6 by mistake, I suppose I used the tab completion with the wrong nick ^^but anyway, I'll try to help you
12:12	<james__>	Is audio quality a known issue with Hardy?
12:12	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; count 'em yourselves
12:12	<NekoKun>	neeto: xUbuntu used a lot of space... and once I can't easilly uninstall packages (as it's easy in windows), I preffer to get a single minimal install and aptget it application by application
12:12	<dagon_>	-s
12:12	<tyranos>	tehgeek, i need brightness buttons to work
12:12	<dagon_>	gah
12:13	<Boredom_inc>	ifireball: No you're going to make him doubt me :P
12:13	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; yourself*
12:13	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok thamks, now i know i'll be fine with 2, since i don't do anything like that.
12:13	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	no problem buddy , Im listening
12:13	<Kirby>	maybe the default graphics driver in ubuntu is not good for my videocard?
12:13	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, what? run free in terminal, mine is 256m
12:13	<Boredom_inc>	﻿lclimber: Look around in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting ... I'm not really sure what the problem is if it's not switching to the headphones... I assume it works in Windows or whatever your previous OS was?
12:13	<obnibolongo>	amerio, wait a minute or so
12:13	<case_>	Kirby, what videocard do you have?
12:13	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	take your time
12:13	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd. Any ideas? I'm afriad my computer might explode if it tries to read the system from CD while burning a CD
12:13	<Tasmaniak>	Hi, since installing Hardy my disk usage (as in activity) is always around 60% and it's starting to worry me...is there likely something wrong?
12:13	<Kirby>	case_: an old one NVIDIA GeForce MX-200
12:14	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; 14740
12:14	<flithm>	hey everyone, what's the ubuntu way of configuring xorg to use my nvidia driver?  Should I just edit the xorg.conf?
12:14	<tehgeek>	tyranos, Oh, those buttons.  :P
12:14	<case_>	Kirby, you probably have to install the nvidia propretary driver to get decent video acceleration...
12:14	<latarsky>	would torrent be faster or a downloader like prozilla or flashget ?
12:14	<DracoZA>	flithm, tried nvidia-settings in a terminal ?
12:14	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc yes, it works on windows, thanx anyways
12:14	<Boredom_inc>	jookia: Lol why are you on the live CD and download the 8.04 CD?
12:14	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd.
12:14	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, 1.4g? ram? then gnome kde you can choose whatever you want
12:14	<Jookia>	boredom:
12:14	<Kirby>	case_: acceleration? do you mean d3d ogl stuff?
12:15	<ifireball>	btw, since games were mentioned, does anybody here knows of a nice fast FPS which isn't network-deathmatch-oriented?
12:15	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, desktop search? Check for Indexing service...
12:15	<Jookia>	It's a long story, upgrade from alt-cd mounted broke 7.10 on HDD, recovering data onto flash drive using Live CD, now up to this problem.
12:15	<josh_>	ifireball:  so if i'm at the partition preparations screen of my ubuntu install, in addition to my swap what do i need to create (other than my Ubuntu partition) and what do i mount where?
12:15	<flithm>	DracoZA: it's not installed :)  so what's the deal, the last ubuntu version automatically detected my nvidia card and gave me compiz and stuff, but not 8.04?
12:15	<Boredom_inc>	ifireball: do they even exist :P
12:15	<case_>	Kirby, opengl only on linux, but yes, that's what i mean. but it also benefits to 2d rendering
12:15	<DracoZA>	flithm, I'm installing as we speak so I cant tell you yet :)
12:15	<Glas`Awyr>	Okay #Ubuntu, I am now running Linux on my laptop.
12:15	<ifireball>	Boredom_inc: they used to >_>
12:16	<Tasmaniak>	obnibolongo: I thought of that, but it says Tracker is idle.
12:16	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; say what? :P it's 14.7 meg
12:16	<tyranos>	so none knows how to get all the fn keys to work
12:16	<ifireball>	josh_: you need a /home partition
12:16	<tyranos>	maybe i need keytouchd
12:16	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, what? i cannot believe that? try run less /proc/meminfo now
12:16	<josh_>	ifireball:  i will put that on my ntfs data partition, so it get backed up.
12:16	<bXi>	does anyone know the difference between vanilla firefox and ubuntu firefox?
12:16	<Pord>	Can any1 help me with a problem im having with my xorg and graphics card.... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4789067#post4789067
12:16	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, I've never found a good util to see what's accessing a disk, I usually nailed them (disk (ab)users) at using top... If you find a better app tell me!
12:16	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You said you would play windows games... make a separate partition and mount it as /windows (Here you can install games that are windows only) mind you save some space for linux games on the linux partition
12:17	<Kirby>	case_: I'll download it later at night. What else can I do to make Ubuntu faster (1. XFce 2. NV driver ...)
12:17	<Glas`Awyr>	I have encountered my first "problem": A Restricted Drivers warning has appeared. It is telling me that my wireless network card driver is proprietary. Is this a real problem?
12:17	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Actually you can mount it as anything.. "/games" might be more appropriate
12:17	<NekoKun>	There's no Ubuntu version of netinst and business card installer?
12:17	<gluer>	Q: how do i change the default icons, such as folder icons?
12:17	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; what difference was it supposed to make? it's still 14.7 meg free, I'm running vmware at desktop 2, that explains it
12:17	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  games will be on the computer i'm building this summer.  my laptop can't play games well.
12:18	<obnibolongo>	amerio, you had it working before how? ndiswrapper?
12:18	<ifireball>	josh_: not a very good idea I'm afraid, since NTFS isn't 100% compatible with Linux, you better make a separate ext3-formatted partition for /home and back it up with Linux tools
12:18	<amerio>	gluer: u need to install a new icons , then copy them to ".icons" folder in Home directory
12:18	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, hmm, that expains it
12:18	<mediacenter>	Ciao a tutti
12:18	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	I had it working without ndiswrapper
12:18	<case_>	Kirby, try nvdriver first. and don't download it form the nvidia website. you should find dozen of tutorial on how to set it up on the ubuntu forum...
12:18	<obnibolongo>	amerio, which driver?
12:18	<kernando>	Helllo is there a way to enable a wireless connection and a lan connection at the same time in ubuntu?
12:18	<mediacenter>	c'è qualcuno che può aiutarmi con una scheda Pinnacle?
12:18	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; sorry if I confused you :)
12:18	<obnibolongo>	amerio, out-of-the-box?
12:19	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Ahh ok... So this computer you're using now already has windows. Yeah it's probably best to create a separate /home partition like ifireball said.
12:19	<wild_oscar>	gluer: System >	Preferences >	Theme >	Customize >	Icons.
12:19	<Kirby>	case_: not from website???
12:19	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, indeed
12:19	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	the same one but I really have no idea how it worked before
12:19	<josh_>	ifireball:  i thought linux could read and write ntfs.  what problems does it have?  how big can home partitions get?
12:19	<case_>	Kirby, all these stuff are in the ubuntu repositories, so you don't need to trust a third party website
12:19	<case_>	Kirby, how many RAM do you have in this PC ?
12:19	<ifireball>	josh_: the security scheme for example is completely different
12:20	<JPSmon>	can someone help me with some module drivers?
12:20	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  my data partition has no os on it.  xp and vista have their own partitions, and my data has its own partition as well.
12:20	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: It can read and writes NTFS... I use it all the time because my brother keeps the music on the windows partition. I've never encountered troubles but technically linux isn't 100% NTFS compatible.
12:20	<Kirby>	case_: 768MB, so how do I install a better driver then?
12:20	<JPSmon>	like how to install and uninstall them?
12:20	<sn0rlax>	hi... I just installed server 8.04 i386. and mysqld_safe is using 100% cpu. funny thing is, there are no databases in mysql yet...
12:20	<inspired>	anyone gotten flash working on Hardy AMD64?
12:20	<ifireball>	josh_: Linux uses the UNIX 12bit permission scheme while NTFS uses complex ACLs
12:20	<kernando>	does anyone knonw how to? i want to connect to my other computer while still connected to the internet??
12:20	<Boredom_inc>	oh yeah and the security is different. Linux can delete whatever it feels like from NTFS
12:20	<gluer>	wild_oscar: i dont have themes in my menu, just appearance
12:20	<obnibolongo>	amerio, well... use forums or google for it, it's the best I can say you... Use http://www.savagehamsters.com/?p=55 for a quickstart
12:20	<josh_>	boredom_inc: would you recommend putting my home directory on a data only ntfs partition?
12:21	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	how about madwifi do u think its gonna work?
12:21	<josh_>	ifireball:  would it be ok if i don't plan to encrypt anything?
12:21	<ifireball>	josh_: no
12:21	<MarV->	hi
12:21	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Probably not. I'd recommend it's own ext3 partition.
12:21	<Tasmaniak>	obnibolongo: I had a look with top as suggested, and I think it may have been the mythtv-backend, I killed the process and it seemed to quieten down a bit. Thanks.
12:21	<Glas`Awyr>	Question #3: I understand there is an incredibly easy way to install software (sudo something...) where can I find out more about that?
12:21	<sn0rlax>	anyone else having problems w/ mysqld_safe maxing out cpu? ( no databases loaded even )
12:21	<josh_>	ifireball: how big can a home directory get?
12:21	<ifireball>	josh_: the different permission scheme may cause all kinds of unexpected problems for various programs
12:21	<MarV->	can someone name me the tool witch installs newest nvidia driver automaticly?
12:22	<tyranos>	envy
12:22	<Villarroel>	Hi.
12:22	<MarV->	ahh right thanks
12:22	<Boredom_inc>	﻿josh_: In fact if you want you could mount the ext3 home directory in windows. I do this also... mind you windows has even less support for ext3 than linux has for NTFS. I did it mostly cause it looks cool :P
12:22	<obnibolongo>	amerio, can't tell you without having messed with that Atheros in particular more... Which I haven't :) (a firend of mine had that wireless card and I gave up trying to make it work on 7.10 :P)
12:22	<tyranos>	MarV-, the tool is named envy
=== Griverr is now known as Griver
12:22	<ifireball>	josh_: depends on what you put in it, this is where all your documents/files/music/video/settings goes to by default
12:22	<wild_oscar>	gluer: then I don't know
12:22	<obnibolongo>	amerio: Google, Forums, and you'll find something. The page I told you had windows drivers which worked well with ndiswrapper :)
12:22	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	I'll try to mess things up now ! if I make it work I'll let you know how ;)
12:22	<obnibolongo>	amerio, good luck :)
12:23	<wild_oscar>	gluer: appearence
12:23	<Villarroel>	Why there aren't jigdo files for 8.04 desktop?
12:23	<wild_oscar>	theme -customize
12:23	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, you welcome :)
12:23	<amerio>	<obnibolongo>	thanx mate
12:23	<wild_oscar>	you have icons there
12:23	<Boredom_inc>	﻿Glas`Awyr: You mean 'sudo apt-get install <packagename>'?
12:23	<obnibolongo>	amerio, :)
12:23	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  could i mount my ext3 directory in my ntfs data partition?  i don't care if windows can't read it.
12:23	<case_>	Kirby, you only need to install packages from the package manager (synaptic) .  you can try to install the package nvidia-settings, it should eventualy set it up to you, but i'm not 100% positive on that point...
12:23	<wild_oscar>	btw, can anyone check if "help" works on appearence?
12:23	<MarV->	are there any problems with envy in 8.04?
12:24	<mademelaugh>	!ext3 | josh_
12:24	<ubotu>	josh_: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via http://www.fs-driver.org

12:24	<obnibolongo>	neeto, VirtualBox
12:24	<Riot777>	anyone here got maybe Leadtek Winfast TV2000 XP tv tuner?
12:24	<case_>	Kirby, setting up the proprietary driver for nvidia videocard is one of the most documented question on ubuntu, i'm not the most qualified to help you...
12:24	<neeto>	cool
12:24	<obnibolongo>	neeto, but really depends on what you want to do
12:24	<eth01>	morning :)
12:25	<mademelaugh>	neeto, yep
12:25	<Kirby>	case_: should XFCE be installed from apt-get also?
12:25	<case_>	Kirby, yes
12:25	<Zarin>	8.04 installer problem: I'm using the Live CD installer but when I get to the partition step the list contains nothing and all the buttons are disabled. Does anyone know anything about this bug?
12:25	<obnibolongo>	neeto, for example, setting up an connectin which is not NAT is a bitch in Linux
12:25	<josh_>	mademelaugh:then what was Boredome_inc talking about?
12:25	<mademelaugh>	!xfce | Kirby
12:25	<ubotu>	Kirby: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of !GNOME. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/ - To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop » - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
12:25	<obnibolongo>	neeto, though Ubuntu wiki is very helpful :)
12:25	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I'm getting a bit lost as to what you are asking now... Just make a ext3 partition and mount it as /home ... You can back it up when you backup your NTFS partition.
12:25	<nullkuhl>	﻿guys,, just installed hardy heron ,, got an ati x1800 mob radeon, activated restricted driver,, when enabling effects the whole system freezes pls advice !!
12:25	<jtravnick>	wild_oscar, not working here
12:25	<mademelaugh>	josh_, sorry but you know the channel is so busy
12:25	<NekoKun>	!minimal
12:25	<ubotu>	The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
12:25	<wild_oscar>	jtravnick: cheers, I'll submit a bug then
12:25	<NekoKun>	mmmm
12:26	<LainIwakura>	Hello, can someone help me with my Internet connection? The network seems to be down, and I can't get it to detect an available wireless network.
12:26	<case_>	Kirby, you have a meta-package called xubuntu-desktop which will install all the packages related to the XFCE desktop...
12:26	<case_>	Kirby, but it will take a lot of disk space...
12:26	<NekoKun>	there's no 8.04 minimal...
12:26	<mademelaugh>	less than gnome...:p
12:26	<iKar>	when I try to boot live cd It says The display server has been shut down for about 6 times In the last 90 sec Its likely smthng bad happened"
12:26	<iKar>	and everything stops
12:27	<tabenx>	I've been searching google for hours and i cant seem to find something similar to both alltray and mail-notification for Evolution. For the most part all i want is to be able to minimize Evolution to tray but with a program that works with compiz-fusion, as alltray does not. Any suggestions?
12:27	<josh_>	Boredome_inc:  "<Boredom_inc>	josh_: In fact if you want you could mount the ext3 home directory in windows. I do this also... mind you windows has even less support for ext3 than linux has for NTFS. I did it mostly cause it looks cool"  what do you mean by mounting the ext3 home directory in windows?
12:27	<case_>	mademelaugh, i mean, having xubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-desktop is a little bit too much :)

12:27	<chazco>	Hi... anyone know if there is a HCL for 8.04? (checking if a Nova-T USB2 stick will work)
12:27	<jtravnick>	wild_oscar, did you do fresh install or upgrade? I did an upgrade
12:27	<Boredom_inc>	Anyways, back to the question I came here to ask... does anybody know of any firefox plugin or something of that nature that views PDFs inside the browser other than the Adobe plugin
12:27	<mademelaugh>	case_, indeed, x isn't important, though
12:27	<banshe>	does anyone run k8m800 via grphx card smoothly in fiesty or hardy?

12:32	<case_>	Kirby, you can hardly delete kernel32.dll beeing Administrator. you can delete the linux kernel beeing root. double check every "rm" or "mv" or "cp" or anything you do...
12:32	<JPSmon>	LianIwakura:  the wiki where?
12:33	<saito>	pushd ndiswrapper-*/

12:35	<Glas`Awyr>	I was expecting sudo
12:35	<damo22>	`mIRC` the alternate disc is for textmode installs... if you dont need to do anything fancy, just get the desktop cd
12:35	<`mIRC`>	sipior>	. ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso and ubuntu-8.04-desktop-i386.iso.....what is the different between them?

12:35	<gerro>	ah I found it thanks
12:35	<case_>	Kirby, you're learning? when you learn, you always finish by typing somthing stupide like "rm * ~" (instead of rm *~ for example). and then you learn (the hard way) thant you don't *want* to be root all the time :)
12:35	<crashanddie>	Glas`Awyr, you can find a package using sudo aptitude search NAME
12:36	<ricanelite>	what is the plugins do I need to have installed so if I head over to a site like computeramerica.com and stream out to listen to there audio shows

12:36	<nullkuhl>	wild_oscar: not with buttons this time,, but 1 with the hostname file,, i change my pcs hostname after installation and then after restart system goes 100% unresponsive ! tilll i went to recovery mode and switched it back to the one choosed at installation
=== desti_T2 is now known as desti
12:36	<guitarj1d>	iKar, but I can't get it to work in Hardy
12:36	<Boredom_inc>	ifireball: Nothing as of yet... I was in the middle of asking if anybody knew of any good software for UML diagrams... I usually just draw them in GIMP or something stupid like that.
12:36	<snp>	need a bit of help with a wireless card, its a d-link DWL-510 (Rev.C), i installed the windows driver using ndiswrapper, the card can detect my wireless network, but i cant connect to it, anyone know why, its using WPA security, all info for the connection is right(i belive)

12:37	<grimsqueaker13>	anyone for that vnc issue? keyboard input garbled when im connected into to gnome using tightvncserver
12:37	<nullkuhl>	wild_oscar: the second one , is with the effects, after enabling the restricted driver for my ati card then enabled effects works for 3 seconds then FULL SYSTEM Freeze ,, not even responsive to power button
12:37	<crashanddie>	rungss, yes, of course
12:37	<Kirby>	case_: I have the installation cd right here, it will take no more than 15 mins to install it back =)
12:37	<wild_oscar>	nullkuhl: did u change hostname in nm-applet?
12:37	<case_>	Kirby, anyway, it's never too early to have good habits.
12:37	<rungss>	crashhanddie: Thanks I have already started upgrading it..
12:37	<Boredom_inc>	rungss: I did and everything is all good ... err I had to fiddle around with my sound a bit but that might have just been my system. Although some people prefer a clean install.
12:38	<nullkuhl>	no.. i changed host name by editing /etc/hostname file
12:38	<iKar>	guitarJ1D:do u know how to make the mwork
12:38	<rungss>	was a littlew concerned if anything goes wrong
12:38	<Kirby>	case_: agreed
12:38	<wild_oscar>	nullkuhl: graphics are always a pain...
12:38	<Glas`Awyr>	Okay. Command accepted merrily, but now I am being asked for my password "[sudo] password for myusername:" but no input is being accepted.
12:38	<nullkuhl>	﻿wild_oscar:i seriously regret waiting and downloading hardy
12:38	<guitarj1d>	iKar, that's what I'm trying to find out
12:38	<crashanddie>	Boredom_inc, do you know bouml ? It's far from making very nice UML diagrams, but they are 100% valid, and 100% complete, it also allows you to export in plenty formats (html, latex) and generate the code signatures for Java/C++/PHP
12:38	<HardyOne>	Glas`Awyr: you will not see any input but type it in and hit enter it will work
12:38	<_Rambaldi_>	its just invisible thats all Glas`Awyr
12:38	<JPSmon>	tailsfan: any luck with the rt2500 ?
12:38	<snp>	need help with a wireless network, using windows driver via ndiswrapper, pm me please!
12:38	<Glas`Awyr>	Okay... it worked!
12:38	<crashanddie>	Boredom_inc, there's also netbeans that allows to do very nice UML, but I've tested it thoroughly
12:38	<HardyOne>	Glas`Awyr: it is a security feature
12:39	<ricanelite>	what is ubuntu restricted apps that i need to install so i could listen to audio streams that use windows media player
12:39	<iKar>	guitarj1d:have u downloaded ati drivers from their website
12:39	<chazco>	Anyone know why the Hardy live CD is in such a low resolution? Gusty used to give 1024x768... this seems to be 640x480
12:39	<JPSmon>	snp: what is your driver?
12:39	<HardyOne>	!wma | ricanelite
12:39	<ubotu>	ricanelite: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
12:39	<rungss>	I won't be able to use my Firefox plugins I gues...???
12:39	<Boredom_inc>	crashhandle: I'll take a look, thanks
12:39	<guitarj1d>	iKar, no i just used the restricted driver downloaded automatically
12:39	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: since you changed your /etc/hostname file your /etc/hosts file is probably is probably out of sync with it, which may cause all kinds of trouble
12:39	<snp>	its for a d-link DWL-510 (Rev.C)
12:39	<Boredom_inc>	crashhanddie:*
12:39	<guitarj1d>	I didn't think ati provided linux drivers
12:39	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: yea may be it was my mistake then,, but the graphics problem is killing me
12:40	<JPSmon>	you see, ubuntu put out a faulty wireless driver on release so that we wouldn't over load the server :OP
12:40	<iKar>	guitarj1d:hmm try to down it ati provides linux drivers go on theyr www.ati.com
12:40	<sanguisdex>	guitarj1d:  the do and if you can get them to work they do pretty good
12:40	<JPSmon>	snp: what is your chipset?
12:40	<Boredom_inc>	rungss: All my firefox work except my gmail manager
12:40	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: i just downloaded the restricted driver then enabled effects,, works exactly for 3 seconds then total system freeze !
12:40	<snp>	hang on
12:40	<JPSmon>	my nVidia worked fine in 7.10 - why won't it work here?
12:41	<HSNews>	which tar options I can unpack bz2 archive?
12:41	<sanguisdex>	is there a way to upgrade using the live CD?
12:41	<rungss>	Boredom_inc: You are using Firefox 3 Beta 5 or did you revert back to Firefox 2??
12:41	<Vitdom>	How do you navigate backwards in the terminal?
12:41	<crashanddie>	JPSmon, I don't have any problems with the drivers, did you activate the restricted drivers ?
12:41	<craigbass1976>	Why have I got an /etc/samba/ folder, but no /etc/init.d/ entry ?
12:41	<iKar>	everybody has problem with graphic card ????
12:41	<banshe>	me
12:41	<banshe>	via k8m800
12:41	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: well, try fixing the /etc/hosts problem first and see what happens (in Linux graphics == networking...)
12:41	<guitarj1d>	iKar, downloading now, will let you know
12:41	<kebab>	I'm trying to set up vmware server on ubuntu 8.04. It asks me: "What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running kernel? [/usr/src/linux/include]" Any idea what the correct directory might be?
12:41	<JPSmon>	sanguisdex: no, you have to use the alternate install CD
12:41	<sanguisdex>	ok
12:42	<JPSmon>	crashanddie: I mean for dual monitoring
12:42	<sanguisdex>	 re downlaodingnow

12:42	<iKar>	guitarj1d: yeah try it wich graph card uv got ?
12:42	<banshe>	kebab, hope u have the linux-sources package installed.
12:42	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: the network problem already fixed i switched back the original hostname
12:42	<erhtdgbrt>	hi
12:42	<guitarj1d>	iKar, 9600
12:42	<chazco>	Anyone know why the Hardy live CD is in such a low resolution? Gusty used to give 1024x768... this seems to be 640x480
12:42	<crashanddie>	JPSmon, dunno then
12:42	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: total freezes are typically roted in hardware problems though, could your system be overheating?
12:42	<damo22>	how can i install xmms in hardy?
12:42	<JPSmon>	chazco: whats your graphics card?
12:43	<crashanddie>	kebab, that's the right answer
12:43	<iKar>	guitarj1d: I have x1950 pro and I had boot problems did U?
12:43	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: but the system doesnt freeze unless i use the wobble windows effect,,
12:43	<crashanddie>	kebab, defaults usually work
12:43	<kebab>	crashanddie: It'd not the right answer
12:43	<chazco>	JPSmon - Its an onboard nvidia card... gives 1024x768 on gusty cd, 1440x900 on gusty with drivers... 640x480 on Hardy...
12:43	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: does the system work right without effects? say, using the restricted driver and playing a 3D game?
12:43	<kebab>	banshe: where do I get linux-sources?
12:43	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: the wobble is one of the more demanding effects afaik
12:44	<nullkuhl>	a 3d game ? have none currently
12:44	<guitarj1d>	iKar, no problem with boot, but I can't adjust screen resolution and the shut down screen colors are all messed up
12:44	<chazco>	JPSmon - Hopefully the drivers will be available when installed, but making install tricky :)
12:44	<banshe>	kebab, synaptic
12:44	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: works fine without effects !

12:46	<DracoZA>	Hold thumbs im about to boot up for the first time after installing
12:46	<pere_>	freze a lot
12:46	<rungss>	What should I do??
12:47	<rhineheart_m>	anybody here who could tell me an experience of heron in server environment?
12:47	<tehgeek>	JPSmon, But Debian isn't really an issue, it's just the "Debian" applications menu that I can't get to show up on my main menu.
12:47	<case_>	debian: ubuntu not for human beeings :)
12:47	<gord>	mohamed_: best way is to use bittorrent, really
12:47	<guitarj1d>	iKar, I'm using 7.10 but still kind of new at it to be honest, whenever I have a problem just check the forums,  I have a good unix cheet sheet thoughhttp://blog.lxpages.com/ultimate_linux.html
12:47	<crashanddie>	kebab, sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-headers
12:47	<usernamed>	Hi all, is this the right place to ask a question about getting a Belkin USB wireless device working?
12:47	<JPSmon>	good luck DravoZA
12:47	<JPSmon>	good luck DracoZA
12:47	<pere_>	plese help, I don kow why my sistem fereze a lot, can  I find a system doctor" to see what happen??
12:47	<mohamed_>	gord this mean to start from begining :)
12:47	<Kirby>	how do I find out the name of the current display?
12:48	<crashanddie>	pere_, check the syslog
12:48	<mohamed_>	gord,  i already download moe than 600 MB
12:48	<JPSmon>	Belkin is the devil
12:48	<kebab>	crashanddie: I already had the latest version
12:48	<pere_>	how?
12:48	<damo22>	i had to download 1800mb for hardy upgrade
12:48	<iKar>	guitarj1d: Im new also and if it wont install .run tnn  I dont know :S
12:48	<gord>	mohamed_: yes, unfortunately, because most meathods dont resume from different places, BUT tell me "how" u downloaded it so far?
12:48	<wigren>	i just upgraded to 8.04 but i can not find how to adjust the brightness of my laptop monitor. any ideas?
12:48	<pere_>	sorry i'm not expert!
12:48	<banshe>	thats y time and again i tell here dont use upgrade.
12:48	<kebab>	crashanddie: and still "The path "/usr/src/linux/include" is not an existing directory."
12:48	<JPSmon>	Usernamed: here and the forums.   Belkin is the devil.  Offers NO software
12:48	<usernamed>	I'm beginning to believe Belkin are the devil, one model number (F5D7050) and 5 different chipsets...
12:48	<Boredom_inc>	usernamed: Well forums are probably a better spot to search first, but people here can probably help
12:49	<JPSmon>	LOL
12:49	<mohamed_>	gord, i use wget -c ...url
12:49	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: either with basic or massive effects when trying to move windows system freezes at once but when trying other effects like fading and minimizing effects works fine
12:49	<crashanddie>	kebab, ln -s /usr/src/`uname -r` /usr/src/linux
12:49	<Boredom_inc>	Lol I'm so confused why is everybodys upgrades bigger than the iso.... Mine wasn't Ls
12:49	<crashanddie>	kebab, sudo that
12:49	<JPSmon>	wonder if there is any local linux guru's I can hire in my town
12:50	<crashanddie>	JPSmon, what's your local town ?
12:50	<Kirby>	what should fps be in glxgears in norm?
12:50	<gord>	mohamed_:aha good. then u can probably save the file into the torrent location and it will pick it up fro there :)
12:50	<iKernel>	JPSmon which town are you in
12:50	<HardyOne>	JPSmon: you can become your local linux guru
12:50	<usernamed>	Basically, I'm running lsusb -v and getting the following two lines...
12:50	<gord>	mohamed_:it will find it and resume from maybe 80% (a guess)
12:50	<kebab>	crashanddie: actually I think I have a different problem, need to go
12:50	<usernamed>	iManufacturer           1 Manufacturer_Realtek
12:50	<usernamed>	  iProduct                2 Belkin Wireless G USB Adapter
12:50	<mohamed_>	thx, gord i will try
12:51	<crashanddie>	kebab, seems the symlink isn't there, have the same problem, issue what I said, should work
12:51	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: sounds like a bug... or a faulty GFX card
12:51	<usernamed>	I'm guessing Realtek do more than one chipset, how do I narrow down what I've got?
12:51	<nullkuhl>	hmmm
12:51	<HardyOne>	JPSmon: perhaps geeksquad is in your area ?
12:51	<iKernel>	usernamed, what problem do you have?
12:51	<xhamahx>	hello, i am using a dell m1330 laptop, when i installed ubuntu, i hav trouble using the internal mic, can anyone help me
12:52	<kebab>	crashanddie: still "The path "/usr/src/linux/include" is not an existing directory." have to go now, sorry
12:52	<gord>	mohamed_: if not dont delete the file u have so far, it may be possible, just ask again if u have problems, someone will help, say u have incomplete wget-ed file and someone might have an idea :) w'salam
12:52	<usernamed>	lsusb shows the belkin device, but there's no wlan0 or other network device
12:52	<guitarj1d>	iKar, installing I will let you know "Type "chmod +x example.run" (press enter).
12:52	<guitarj1d>	4.  Now type "./example.run", press enter, and the installer will run."
12:52	<LainIwakura>	Hello, can someone help me configure my broadcom chipset? The wiki page is not helpful. Thanks.
12:52	<crashanddie>	kebab, you must have messed up the command I gave you
12:52	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: try playing a game with effects off, I don't really know which 3D games are bundled with Ubuntu though, check the Add/Remove applet
12:52	<mohamed_>	thx gord, salam :)
12:53	<JPSmon>	HardyOne: geeksquad only installs stereos for rich old people
12:53	<Glas`Awyr>	I am apparently a failure.
12:53	<mademelaugh>	LainIwakura, what does hwinfo say
12:53	<NekoKun>	Can I add drivers to hardy's mini.iso?
12:53	<marvxxx>	just upgraded to hardy and my flash plugin in firefox doesnt have sound no more..any ideas?
12:53	<iKernel>	usernamed ah, is it the belkin wireless usb?
12:53	<Nuc134rB0t>	usernamed, type lspci
12:53	<usernamed>	iKernel, It certainly is
12:53	<Pord>	any1 else having driver issues with ati graphics cards?
12:53	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: Does everything else have sound? eg. Totem etc.?
12:53	<HardyOne>	JPSmon: hehe is that so? I just remember seeing the cars on the road thinking I need to get a job with those guys
12:53	<harveyd>	how do you enable modules in apache installed in ubuntu?
12:53	<iKernel>	usernamed I doubt you'll have much luck with usb wireless, I'd recccommend buying a dlink card with an atheros chipset
12:54	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: yep...but i found a thread at forums
12:54	<harveyd>	i remember it had a funny command line helped, but cant find / remember the name
12:54	<LainIwakura>	mademelaugh: i'm not booted in ubuntu now.. will ifconfig, iwconfig, lshw -C network, lspci, or lsmod suffice (those of which I have written down)
12:54	<ere4si>	NekoKun: the mini iso is the net install  - most apps are d/loaded
12:54	<HardyOne>	harveyd: restart apache after you add the modules to your .conf
12:54	<iKernel>	usernamed anything with an atheros chipset will do actually, best to get one that goes into PCI port
12:54	<xhamahx>	hello, i am using a dell m1330 laptop, when i installed ubuntu, i hav trouble using the internal mic, can anyone help me
12:54	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: lol ok
12:54	<NekoKun>	ere4si: But I need some basic drivers... even to the wireless...
12:54	<usernamed>	the case is such that the graphics card coolling hangs over the one remaining pci slot, no pci expansion possible :(
12:54	<snask>	xhamahx, what soundcard do you got?
12:54	<iKernel>	usernamed and I know the nature of new linux users, they will fight trying to make their current hardware work instead of buying something else. but the better option is to go out and buy something else
12:54	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: i will check
12:54	<plagerism>	Is there anyway to automatically set the execute bit on oridinary files ala umask or any other means?
12:55	<crashanddie>	xhamahx, could be please explain more "having troubles" isn't an error message
12:55	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: works
12:55	<ifireball>	harveyd, HardyOne: if its apache2 there is a command a2-something (use tab...)
12:55	<ere4si>	NekoKun: then the mini iso won't be appropriate for you afaik
12:55	<iKar>	oki I downloaded drivers and Im waiting thx 4 command
12:55	<crashanddie>	plagerism, chmod +x file
12:55	<usernamed>	iKernel, is there no USB solution possible?
12:55	<Glas`Awyr>	I'm going to have one more poke at this. If I can't get xChat running on my machine there is no hope for me.
12:55	<ToM-X>	Hey, Can someone take a look at this for me. I want to know if my WIFI now works without Ndiswrapper http://i29.tinypic.com/14b6jqe.png
12:55	<HardyOne>	ifireball: no idea. just know that apache needs to be rehashed/restarted anytime you add something to it
12:55	<Ravenkin>	Can you use a KDE application on a Gnome system?
12:55	<harveyd>	a2enmod
12:55	<xhamahx>	i mean, ubuntu itself dont detect the mic,
12:55	<harveyd>	thats it, thanks
12:55	<plagerism>	crashanddie: ala umask, as in automatically upon creation
12:56	<ifireball>	harveyd: a2enmod
12:56	<crashanddie>	plagerism, no, why would you need it ?
12:56	<iKernel>	usernamed probably, but the belkin usb is very crap anyway, and drops out frequently. I had to install the drivers on windows frequently whenever it stopped working
12:56	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: This is the standard flash plugin yes? As in adobes?
12:56	<iKernel>	usernamed, so even if you can  get it working, it will probably not be worth it
12:56	<ere4si>	Ravenkin: you can but alot of extras will be d/loaded to make it work
12:56	<beniamino>	how do i control what meta-release file is used? every time i run update-manager on hardy, i get 'current dist not found in meta-release file'
12:56	<Ravenkin>	ere4si thanks
12:56	<Boredom_inc>	Does anyone know which mixed flash plugin uses by default... eg. ALSA
12:56	<ere4si>	k
12:56	<ToM-X>	Anyone lol?
12:57	<crashanddie>	plagerism, only the program that creates the file can set given bits on it, the samba server allows you to set execute bits, but you need to go through it
12:57	<ifireball>	HardyOne: yeah, but you don't need to actually tweak the conf file since the apache2 config is modular, you have symlink directories a-la /etc/rc*.d
12:57	<Batch>	#ubuntu - I installed the correct drivers using ndisgtk, It said there WAS hardware for it so i don't see why the light should stay orange. I also modprobed.
12:57	<iKernel>	ToM-X what?
12:57	<Glas`Awyr>	I am in the Add/Remove Applications window. I can see xChat. I click it, and it tells me "The list of applications is not available"
12:57	<usernamed>	iKernel, thanks for the advice.  All, if anyone knows of a usb solution that works out of the box with Ubuntu I'd greatly appreciate it.
12:57	<HardyOne>	ifireball: my answer was very general I realise. but he got the jist I think
12:57	<iKernel>	Batch, have tried scanning around for aps?
12:57	<mademelaugh>	Glas`Awyr, try sudo apt-get install xchat
12:58	<mademelaugh>	!info xchat
12:58	<ubotu>	xchat (source: xchat): IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.8.4-0ubuntu7 (hardy), package size 301 kB, installed size 808 kB
12:58	<ToM-X>	iKernel: I just install 8.04 and seen this on the restricted hardware http://i29.tinypic.com/14b6jqe.png    does mean I can use my WIFI without NDISWRAPPER?
12:58	<Oprtz>	if i want to show screenshot to someone? how to do that? which website to use?
12:58	<Batch>	iKernel: Yes, No scan results
12:58	<Batch>	Even though i am 1 metre away from the router.
12:58	<HardyOne>	!repositories | Glas`Awyr  enable Universe and Multiverse if you have not done so
12:58	<Glas`Awyr>	"E: Couldn't find package xchat"
12:58	<ubotu>	Glas`Awyr  enable Universe and Multiverse if you have not done so: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections.

12:58	<crashanddie>	usernamed, I'd suggest you read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported
12:58	<iKernel>	ToM-X what kind of wifi do you have?
12:58	<beniamino>	can someone with a fresh hardy install tell me the contents of the file /var/lib/update-manager/meta-release-lts ?
12:58	<usernamed>	thanks crashanddie!
12:59	<iKernel>	ToM-X ah-ha, atheros. Yes, with atheros you can easily use your wifi card without ndiswrapper. download madwifi
12:59	<iKar>	Iv got some engenius wi fi will it work?
12:59	<Boredom_inc>	im going to boot... good luck with the troubles everyone... bye
[13:00	<iKernel>	iKar depends
[13:00	<ifireball>	HardyOne: blah blah <insert comment about how we always rush to give the old command line ways of doing stuff when Ubuntu typically includes an easier way, thus making ppl think its harder then it is>
[13:00	<psych>	ubuntu guys did a fine job
[13:00	<snask>	whatś the best and easyest audio streaming program för ubuntu?  with gui
[13:00	<iKar>	iKErnel:On what?
[13:00	<psych>	hardy is smooth
[13:00	<ToM-X>	iKernel: When I try to install xen-restricted-modules-2.6.17-6-generic-xen0 it says: Depends: xen-image-xen0-2.6.17-6-generic-xen0  but it is not installable Any Idea?
[13:00	<iKernel>	iKar on what kind of chisep it is
[13:00	<crashanddie>	snask, gmplayer ?
[13:01	<HardyOne>	ifireball: point taken and I will from now on try to not jump in when not certain of an answer :)
[13:01	<iKernel>	ToM-X why are you trying to install xen modules? are you running an xen kernel?
[13:01	<snask>	crashanddie, ill try it =)
[13:01	<psych>	why totem work so bad
[13:01	<nxusr>	 is there anyone else out there having problem with ndiswrapper and teh newer kernels diabling the device irq on boot?
[13:01	<psych>	:/
[13:01	<iKernel>	ToM-X seach in synaptic package manageer for madwifi, you may have to enable some repositories
[13:01	<iKar>	iKernel:its engenius usb antenna and how to find on wich chipset?
[13:01	<iKernel>	ToM-X if you can't find madwifi, tell me and I'll help further, it may not even be out yet
[13:01	<iKernel>	for hardy
[13:02	<gord>	mohamed_: i just had a thought, wget shouldn't over write the old file by default, (as long as size+filename+datestamps are the same) so you could try wget -c }differentserver/filename{ again and see what happens, but copy the file somewhere first to maske sure. I wasnt thinking straight, i assumed at first you had used something horrible like windozeIE do download it, wget is very good, i think it will just work, starting at the offset fro
[13:02	<gord>	m the filesize u have
[13:02	<mademelaugh>	!apt-list
[13:02	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about apt-list - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[13:02	<f0rmat>	why is it that every file i create in my htdocs folder i have to change the permissions for anyone on the web to see it
[13:02	<f0rmat>	?
[13:02	<nxusr>	 is there anyone else out there having problem with ndiswrapper and the newer kernels disabling the device irq on boot?
=== ajmorris is now known as ajmorris|AFK
[13:02	<ibleed>	if i encrypt a partition on my hard drive can i have it so it doesn't automatically mount on boot ?
[13:02	<Batch>	Also, When i use "ndiswrapper -l" it shows the driver bcmw15 as installed, So i don't see what the problem is
[13:02	<iKar>	(2:01:30 PM) iKar: iKernel:its engenius usb antenna and how to find on wich chipset?
[13:02	<crashanddie>	gord, wget will not resume by default, but create a different file
[13:02	<iKernel>	nxusr no but personally, I wouldn't use any card that requires ndiswrapper. Find a card with an atheros chipset
[13:02	<ToM-X>	iKernel: No, I only see Madwifi Tools.
[13:03	<Ravenkin>	Anyone know of a front end for Cron?
[13:03	<crashanddie>	iKar, lspci -v
[13:03	<nxusr>	iKernel, not much of a choice, came with the notebook
[13:03	<iKernel>	ToM-X, right, install madwifi tools, and tell me if it selects any other packages due to dependicies
[13:03	<MadJawa>	I can't update some sources
[13:03	<gord>	<crashanddie: will the -nc help? i dont recall much wget-tiness today
[13:03	<iKar>	iKernel:No money :D
[13:04	<ToM-X>	iKernel: No, It just installed on it's own.
[13:04	<DracoZA>	why if I try to sudo do I get the message unable to resolve host ?
[13:04	<iKernel>	ToM-X right, let me google around for a moment
[13:04	<ToM-X>	Thanks.
[13:05	<jtravnick>	MadJawa, what sources are you having problems with?
[13:05	<crashanddie>	gord, it will rewrite or simply refuse to download, depending on the situation (timestamp, etc)
[13:05	<iKernel>	ToM-X search for linux-restricted-modules
[13:05	<gord>	crashanddie: he's already using wget -c    u suu, to continue it, its the change of server address he was worrying about
[13:05	<chazco>	Can someone confirm it is now possible to skip the 30th-boot fsck by pressing a key?
=== albinou is now known as albinou[0]
[13:05	<iKernel>	ToM-X oh, and open up a terminal and tell me the output of uname -r
[13:05	<crashanddie>	gord, it's the same filename, so -c will always resume
[13:06	<ere4si>	chazco: the escape key has always worked for me
[13:06	<bXi>	does anyone know the difference between vanilla firefox and ubuntu firefox?
[13:06	<DracoZA>	anyone have an idea why I cant use sudo ?
[13:06	<chazco>	ere4si - Never worked for me, seems to be offering the option now in Hardy :)
[13:06	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, no, but I'm sure an error message will help us
[13:06	<mademelaugh>	DracoZA, why
[13:06	<ToM-X>	iKernel: 2.6.24-16-generic and I have just searched.
[13:06	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, few lines up..I get unable to resolve hostname
[13:06	<MadJawa>	jtravnick: http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy/Release.gpg (timed out)
[13:06	<MadJawa>	and other too
[13:06	<iKernel>	ToM-X did any packages come up?
[13:06	<mademelaugh>	DracoZA, i think you need to edit /etc/sudoers
[13:06	<dredhammer>	anyone know how to enable the nvidia closed drivers for hardy in the latest kernel?
[13:07	<ifireball>	bXi: quite a few of then, Ubuntu FF for example supports installing plugins/extensions from *.deb files
[13:07	<iKernel>	mademelaugh how can he do that without root priveledges though?
[13:07	<newcomer008>	hallo
[13:07	<SimplySeth>	how do I set to boot at runlevel 3 (command line)
[13:07	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, did you change the name of your computer ?
[13:07	<iKernel>	SimplySeth edit /etc/inittab
[13:07	<newcomer008>	hello everybody
[13:07	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, not from the install name

[13:07	<thiagoss>	Where can I find the hashes for the ubuntu 8.04 images?
[13:07	<bXi>	ifireball: i'm having issues with some javascript/php which only gets triggered when using the firefox in ubuntu
[13:08	<HardyOne>	!runlevel
[13:08	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about runlevel - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[13:08	<SimplySeth>	iKernel: funny thing .. didn't find it :-/ .. mebbe it was brain gas .. lemme look again
[13:08	<newcomer008>	can someone help me with wlan pls? :( dosnt work
[13:08	<mademelaugh>	iKernel, god, didn't install ubuntu yourself
[13:08	<iKernel>	ToM-X ok, take a screenshot and upload it somewhere for me
[13:08	<gord_>	 crashanddie: yeah i told him to put the half-baked file into a torrent client and see if it picked up from there anyways
[13:08	<damo22>	can someone help me with this? http://pastebin.com/d1d6f191e
[13:08	<wookienz>	should i install an irc server on ubunutu server at home of just create a channel on this irc server?
[13:08	<nikitis>	Question:  When dual booting windows xp and ubuntu, does your root partion have to have a boot flag?
[13:08	<iKernel>	SimplySeth, try locate inittab
[13:08	<SimplySeth>	iKernel: aight .. thanks
[13:08	<wookienz>	and any suggestions for an irc server for my home server...
[13:08	<wib>	hi. i have some performance issues during video playback. the fan is going crazy :( it was fine under feisty
[13:09	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, I remember being unable to sudo once, after changing the hostname, try rebooting, if doesn't work, you're going have to boot from another medium, mount partition, and find out what happened
[13:09	<iKernel>	wib, are you running any other programs?
[13:09	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, but without more information, nor anything you did, we won't be able to help, sorry
[13:09	<nikitis>	Anyone?
[13:09	<crashanddie>	nikitis, yes
[13:09	<gilster32>	hello
[13:09	<iKernel>	nikitis no it doesn't
[13:09	<ToM-X>	iKernel: http://i30.tinypic.com/2z754ec.png
[13:09	<mademelaugh>	crashanddie, hostname mismatch?
[13:09	<iKernel>	nikitis only your boot partition has to have a boot flag
[13:09	<wib>	iKernel: just firefox, pidgin, evolution
[13:09	<mademelaugh>	!hostname
[13:09	<ubotu>	Use hostname <somehostname>	to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hostname  and /etc/hosts . WARNING! Make sure that your current hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly. Alternatively, use the gui at system>administration>networking on the "General" tab
[13:10	<ifireball>	bXi: well, check the versions, the Ubuntu version may be slightly older, can you give more details about your problem?
[13:10	<iKernel>	nikitis however if you're booting straight to your root partition instead of having a seperate boot partition, then yes
[13:10	<gilster32>	looking for info on getting gui support in one of the burning apps for old DVD-RAM discs....anyone know about this.
[13:10	<reymelsk88>	windows rules  :P
[13:10	<wib>	iKernel: and compiz
[13:10	<nikitis>	iKernel: My windows partition has a boot flag, but my /boot doesn't  Would this cause an error 17 in Grub?
[13:10	<snp>	Just make sure that the linux-restricted-modules are installed.
[13:10	<iKernel>	gilster32 why use GUI when you can just use cdrecord
[13:10	<snp>	how would i go about doing thatr?
[13:10	<bXi>	ifireball: basicly i use mootools to POST a form
[13:10	<bXi>	to a php page
[13:10	<newcomer008>	iKernel: can u halp me with wlan plz? seems like you know about ubuntu well
[13:10	<damo22>	can someone help me with jackd under hardy? http://pastebin.com/d1d6f191e
[13:10	<crashanddie>	newcomer008, what's the matter ?
[13:10	<jerzyk86>	 i have GF 8800gt with auto cooling FAN, in windows its very quaiet, but in linux it is runing alweys 100%, how can i make it lower ??
[13:10	<sarkie>	Hi, just upgraded to Hardy, and done an update check now it says 177 updates, there was a partial upgrade or something else. This is wrong I assume
[13:10	<iKernel>	nikitis yes, absouloutely
[13:11	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, I typed sudo after logging in for the first time, brand new install and I get unknown host
[13:11	<gilster32>	ikernel:thats fine....how do i use cdrecord with DVD-RAM discs
[13:11	<bXi>	when i print_r($_POST) i dont see anything while firebug tells me the data is what i expect
[13:11	<iKernel>	wib ah-ha, compiz. were you running compiz with feisty?
[13:11	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: my AVM wlan stick doesnt work
[13:11	<bXi>	this only happens on firefox 2 and 3b5
[13:11	<gilster32>	ikernel:i need to format them as UDF
[13:11]  * SimplySeth wonders if anyone else's gdm got hosed after upgrading :-/
[13:11	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, can you 'cat /etc/hostname' and tell me what it says ?
[13:11	<iKernel>	gilster32 should just be able to stick the dvd-ram stick in and go cdrecord blah.iso
[13:11	<ifireball>	bXi: btw the gory details of changes Ubuntu made are in: /usr/share/doc/firefox/changelog.Debian.gz
[13:11	<wib>	iKernel: yes. and it was gutsy, my mistake
[13:11	<bXi>	the ubuntu versions of firefox that is
[13:11	<crashanddie>	newcomer008, please explain "doesn't work", we need real error messages
[13:11	<gilster32>	ikernel: no
[13:11	<iKernel>	gilster32 you'll need soemthing to create the iso file though
[13:11	<jtravnick>	MadJawa, you sure thats a valid source? also if you did an upgrade make sure your third party sources say hardy and not gutsy
[13:11	<iKernel>	gilster32 what do you mean, "no"?
[13:12	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: first ubuntu see the wlans near me, but if i try to connect ubuntu crashes
[13:12	<ToM-X>	iKernel: http://i30.tinypic.com/2z754ec.png
[13:12	<crashanddie>	newcomer008, which driver are you using ? Which version ? Which chipset ?
[13:12	<swamy>	can anyone tell me how upgrade gutsy to hardy using aptitude command line
[13:12	<crashanddie>	swamy, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[13:12	<gilster32>	ikernel: this is not a stick. i bought a long time ago a packet of DVD-RAM dvds. i want to erase them and formate them, must have a UDF filesystem.
[13:13	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: im runnig an ibm t30 notebook with the new ubuntu 8.04 and the avm wlan usb stick
[13:13	<iKernel>	swamy first change your apt.sources file to the hardy sources, then run apt-get update, then run apt-get dist-upgrade
[13:13	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, it says "Thumper" which is the name of the machine
[13:13	<ifireball>	bXi: the  print_r($_POST) command is a PHP command right?
[13:13	<SimplySeth>	iKernel: its official .. I have no inittab
[13:13	<crashanddie>	newcomer008, which version of the driver ?
[13:13	<NekoKun>	ere4si: About the mini install, well, not even USB drivers are loaded?
[13:13	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: and i use the preinstalled driver
[13:13	<swamy>	crashhanddie: i did but sources are not available
[13:13	<mouseclon1>	hello everyone
[13:13	<gilster32>	ikernel: are you familiar with DVD-RAM media?
[13:13	<crashanddie>	newcomer008, I don't know all the drivers by heart, can you try to find out ? Or at least give me the chipset name of your usb wifi dongle
[13:14	<MadJawa>	jtravnick: it seems that the french servers are a bit laggy at this time
[13:14	<iKernel>	ToM-X ok, looks like you've already got linux-restricted installed, have you been into the restricted drivers manager yet?
[13:14	<mouseclon1>	I joined 8.04 to AD.  Now I'm unable to sudo anything.  Any ideas?
[13:14	<MadJawa>	I think I should wait
[13:14	<ere4si>	NekoKun: it is all about getting the necessaries from the net - so it uses minimal resources
[13:14	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: ill try out to find find out what driver it exactly is
[13:14	<iKernel>	gilster32 yes I am, it is used in cam corder and can be repetadly written to without having to blank the disk
[13:14	<swamy>	iKernel: i did aptitude update and then aptitude full-upgrade, but links are not avalaible
[13:14	<mademelaugh>	ere4si, hello, how are you doing
[13:14	<ifireball>	bXi: not sure how trustworthy is firebug here, I'd try to sniff the communications, but that may be a rather radical approach, do you get any errors in the JS console?
[13:14	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, hang on, what command are you executing with sudo ?
[13:14	<iKernel>	swamy you're in trouble then :)
[13:14	<manawenuz>	@all i just wanted some help in configuring a PPTP VPN server under ubuntu 7.10 server , can anyone help me so i can connect to this server via windows client ???
[13:14	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, sudo echo "test"
[13:14	<chazco>	Hi... is this correct for mediabuntu - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring
[13:14	<iKernel>	swamy did you try apt-get dist-upgrade?
[13:14	<scizzo->	swamy: tried using do-release-upgrade ?
[13:14	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, sudo nano
[13:15	<NekoKun>	ere4si: yes, but, it needs to be on a lan... in my case the best option would be a wireless connection
[13:15	<Batch>	Lol, I've been patient but the room isn't quietening down xD
[13:15	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, sudo echo gives the same error
[13:15	<gilster32>	ikernel:thats correct. but i cant write to it with any old prgram like cdrecord or k3b etc. unless i have them formatted to udf.
[13:15	<N1NCHN41L5>	can anyone help me dual boot a Linux OS
[13:15	<snp>	Just make sure that the linux-restricted-modules are installed.
[13:15	<snp>	how would i go about doing thatr?
[13:15	<mouseclon1>	or could someone point me in a direction to get sudo working with AD?
[13:15	<bXi>	ifireball: everything is fine otherwise just that it doesnt show.. weirdest is that firefox 2.0.0.14 in windows works and an older firefox on a custom linux distro also works
[13:15	<intrinsyx>	Howdy folks. I have a laptop, and I just did a full wipe and reinstall of hardy from scratch. I used to have a little tray icon to set my CPU speed, but I can't remember the package name to reinstall it. Would anyone happen to know?
[13:15	<ere4si>	NekoKun: try the alternate cd then - I don't think the mini cd will do that
[13:15	<ifireball>	bXi: could your Ubuntu FF contain other plug-ins that may be in the way?  noscript, etc. ?
[13:15	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, in fact just typing sudo gives me unable to resolve hostname
[13:15	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, can you paste the exact error ?
[13:15	<ToM-X>	iKernel: Is "Hardware Drivers" the restricted driver manager in 8.04 is it not?
[13:15	<mouseclon1>	N1NCHN41L5: You will need to install windows first
[13:15	<swamy>	can anyne tell me from which mirror i should upgrade my gutsy to hardy
[13:16	<manawenuz>	@all i just wanted some help in configuring a PPTP VPN server under ubuntu 7.10 server , can anyone help me so i can connect to this server via windows client ???
[13:16	<mouseclon1>	N1NCHN41L5: then install linux
[13:16	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, (if it's one line only)
[13:16	<iKernel>	ToM-X yeah it is
[13:16	<garu>	hey everyone
[13:16	<bXi>	ifireball: only extra plugin i had was greasemonkey but i removed that one now
[13:16	<dagon_>	swamy; just run it with update-manager
[13:16	<iKernel>	gilster32 what's the problem with formatting to udf then
[13:16	<ToM-X>	iKernel: It is still the same.
[13:16	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, "sudo: unable to resolve host Thumper"
[13:16	<ere4si>	madamelaugh: I always do well
[13:16	<gilster32>	ikernel:thats what i am trying to do ;-)
[13:16	<mouseclon1>	N1NCHN41L5: if you have Vista it may ba a little hairy.. I have only done 95, 98, and XP for windows dual boot
[13:16	<ifireball>	bXi: what I wonder is if the data is posted at all, maybe something about the post triggers other behavior from PHP
[13:16	<mouseclon1>	N1NCHN41L5: but windows has to be on the MBR
[13:16	<iKernel>	gilster32 oh, right. not sure, sorry
[13:16	<intrinsyx>	"Restricted Driver Manager" is now "jockey-gtk"/"Hardware Drivers" in hardy.
[13:17	<swamy>	i not able to dist-upgrade gutsy since links are not available
[13:17	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, ok, I think I know what this is about
[13:17	<broonie>	I'm probably being really thick here but I can't seem to figure out how to drag and drop files in Hardy.
[13:17	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, can you cat /etc/hosts and paste the output to a pastebin ?
[13:17	<N1NCHN41L5>	mousecion - dual booting vista w/out sp1 is EASY
[13:17	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, or just the first two lines (127.x.x.x)
[13:17	<bXi>	ifireball: thats what i'd like to know
[13:17	<dagon_>	swamy; run a terminal, sudo update-manager and it should pop up there. did you try that?
[13:18	<bXi>	gonna try wireshark
[13:18	<garu>	I just made a fresh install of the 8.04 LTS, and something I noticed is that, there was no updates available after restarting the system.Can someone tell me why, or is my system going nuts? THANKS

[13:18	<intrinsyx>	I have a laptop, and I just did a full wipe and reinstall of hardy from scratch. I used to have a little *tray* icon to set my CPU speed, but I can't remember the package name to reinstall it. (No, it's not the one in gnome-applets, called cpufreq-selector)  Would anyone happen to know?
[13:18	<ToM-X>	iKernel: Shall I just try and compile and Install?
[13:18	<swamy>	can anyne tell me from which mirror i should upgrade my gutsy to hardy
[13:18	<swamy>	please  help me
[13:19	<intrinsyx>	garu: 8.04 was just released this morning, there are no updates yet.
[13:19	<gotenks>	i doubt there would be many(if any) updates to hardy, since its been out for not even 1 day
[13:19	<N1NCHN41L5>	i tried an when i loaded muppy008 it tore up GRUB an NADA worked
[13:19	<iKernel>	gilster32 you might find this interesting, http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-udf/

[13:19	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, bingo
[13:19	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, can you gksudo /etc/hosts ?
[13:19	<iKernel>	ToM-X yeah, you're going to need the kernel sources though
[13:19	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: ive copied the part of syslog which is about the wlan stick i just put in. here it is: http://pastebin.com/d1b0e484b
[13:19	<garu>	intrinsyx humn...thanks!I thought it came out yesterday!lol
[13:19	<beniamino>	can i switch apt-get to to a local mirror? is there a mirror in the uk?
[13:19	<iKernel>	ToM-X while I've been sucessful in doing that, it may require a little bit of experience in linux

[13:19	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, gksudo gedit /etc/hosts

[13:22	<intrinsyx>	yaroslav: us.archive.ubuntu.org is still slow as fsck.
[13:22	<crashanddie>	swamy, stop asking, use a local mirror, check the mirror list on the Ubuntu.com website, find something close to you, and stick to it.
[13:22	<Derspankster>	slow

[13:23	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, you upgraded from gutsy to hardy, no ?
[13:23	<swamy>	iKernel: is hardy stable released  or is it in testing phase
[13:23	<iKernel>	ToM-X that's the one :)
[13:23	<mouseclon1>	N1NCHN41L5: You got me on that one.  I have yet to try and dual boot multi *nix systems.  Though I should.. I just have a laptop or 2 that I can blow away at any time needed for a different OS

[13:23	<DracoZA>	crashanddie, indeed
[13:23	<arvind_khadri>	iKernel, its due to the new release
[13:23	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, maybe you should try to file a bug or something

[13:30	<ifireball>	bXi: probably some backported anti-phishing feature or something
[13:30	<gilster32>	ikernel:i think i have seen this before...udf format from cli. will give it a go
[13:30	<jrib>	Myrtti: he's just updating from beta though so dist-upgrade should be enough right?
[13:30	<intrinsyx>	indian_munnda: hold alt, hit F2, type gconf-editor

[13:31	<jeanre>	does anyone here have rez-looks packages?
[13:31	<garu>	iKernel because it says that its in use, but not enabled...which is weird when never gave me any problem in any of the past releases!
[13:31	<Myrtti>	rafelbev: then the updates haven't probably yet reached your mirror
[13:31	<rafelbev>	am using UK
[13:32	<erik__>	ah
[13:32	<intrinsyx>	indian_munnda: Most of the gconf keys have descriptions which will tell you what the options do.
[13:32	<Myrtti>	rafelbev: if you get a message saying "nothing to update" lalala
[13:32	<ifireball>	bXi: since they stick to a certain FF version they backport security fixes from newer versions, this may break over-complex stuff like JS toolkits... but this is all speculation, you need to get to the JS error message somehow
[13:32	<NeT_DeMoN>	i have wireless card problems, in my restricted device manager it says its in use but theres no wireless option in my connections tab :S can anyone help?

[13:33	<amerio>	NeT_DeMoN same problem here =)
[13:33	<zrex>	Anyone know a good DASHBOARD for UBUNTU?  Like Apple's dashboard?

[13:36	<intrinsyx>	tar up your homedir and do a clean install

[13:36	<amerio>	NeT_DeMoN try "lshw -C network"

[13:39	<NeT_DeMoN>	amerio: wow, alot of problems with Atheros

[13:46	<slytherin>	chazco: none of them
[13:46	<arvind_khadri>	kim_, gparted
[13:46	<IsotropicSpin>	avrind_khadri: thx. will have a look
[13:46	<v0lksman>	erik__: nope...as long as it was there that's a good start....if it wasn't and you just added it you will need to log out and back in for it to take effect...are you connecting to the machine remotely or are you on console?
[13:46	<iKernel>	amerio, have you tried to modprobe ath_pci
[13:46	<kimx>	I mean a tool to manage mountpoints
[13:46	<amerio>	iKernel blacklisted
[13:46	<N1NCHN41L5>	lesjohn - dont worry - even though its text only install - u get full gui system an all when its installed
[13:46	<erik__>	v0lksman: this is a desktop computer. no remote connection
[13:46	<erik__>	v0lksman: i added it and logged back in.. no change
[13:46	<chazco>	Thanks slytherin
[13:46	<iKernel>	amerio, that's strange why would it be blacklisted....
[13:46	<ToM-X>	iKernel: Still searching :)
[13:46	<slytherin>	kimx: what king od management do you want?
[13:46	<amerio>	iKernel I did it lol
[13:47	<niki_>	Question with GRUB.  I just ran "sudo grub" and had it reinstall itself.  I changed the boot order in the BIOS, now i'm in my linux distribution.  But I had to change from hd(1,0) to hd(0,0) which isn't right.  Can anyone explain to me why they are off?
[13:47	<iKernel>	ToM-X, searching for what?
=== yarddog- is now known as yarddog_
[13:47	<erik__>	v0lksman: clicking the unlock button just freezes the window for a moment and gives me an windowsy "unknown error", heh
[13:47	<iKernel>	amerio, well remove the black list, ath_pci is needed
[13:47	<roocraig>	login preferences trouble
[13:47	<v0lksman>	erik__:  I remote to my desktop all the time and PolicyKit is picky about that...that's why I ask....
[13:47	<shane2_>	does anyone know if the gnome desktop package is still broken for the server install?
[13:47	<Lainy>	Yes, i got broadcom to work!!!
[13:47	<mattycoze>	hey how do i downgrade the version of my bluez-utils?
[13:47	<kimx>	slytherin: I don't understand your question
[13:47	<amerio>	iKernel but im using atheros windows driver on ndiswrapper
[13:47	<N1NCHN41L5>	dual booting linux OS"s ????????
[13:47	<iKernel>	amerio, well don't
[13:47	<Lainy>	How do I downgrade my firefox so I can installplugins that will work?
[13:47	<iKernel>	amerio, you should be able to get ath_pci to work
[13:48	<slytherin>	kimx: when you say mount point management, do you want to create them or what?
[13:48	<emorris>	﻿kimx: you can change the mountpoints in places>computer, right click on ur part.>volume>settings
[13:48	<ToM-X>	iKernel: How come it's saying my WIFI is not in use on Hardware Driver? Is it because I have Ndiswrapper enabled?
[13:48	<nickthorley>	can anyone tell me the version of the kernel used by 8.04 before any updates?
[13:48	<amerio>	iKernel so no need for ndiswrapper?
[13:48	<v0lksman>	erik__:  well that is about all the troubleshooting I know of to make policykit work...hahaha...you may want to try re-installing the packages in Synaptic as I've seen it help some people....but unforunately that's about all I can offer... :)
[13:48	<iKernel>	amerio, no
[13:48	<erik__>	v0lksman: ah ok.. bummer
[13:48	<slytherin>	shane2_: was there any bug for that?
[13:48	<iKernel>	ToM-X, I don't know, but I thought you were going to compile and install madwifi?
[13:48	<arvind_khadri>	Lainy, get the .deb from somewhere and remove the present and install it
[13:48	<slytherin>	shane2_: and how did you try to install gnome desktop? which package did you choose?
[13:48	<ToM-X>	iKernel: I have.
[13:48	<shane2_>	slytherin, hmm, I think, but I can't remember, ahh, seems someone did file one.
[13:48	<roocraig>	bug for screensaver preferences?
[13:48	<amerio>	iKernel ok but when ndiswrapper disabled , wireless doesnt work even if the athpci is enabled
[13:48	<erik__>	i might do a fresh install after work
[13:48	<iKernel>	ToM-X, oh, okay, try a modprobe ath_pci then
[13:48	<DJones>	nickthorley: I think 2.6.24.16 (from memory on an upgrade to 8.04 I've just done)
[13:48	<Lainy>	arvind_khadri: Thank you.
[13:49	<kimx>	emorris: thanks
[13:49	<iKernel>	amerio, you probably need madwifi-tools
[13:49	<shane2_>	slytherin, apt-get install gnome; apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment; apt-get install gnome-desktop
[13:49	<FooAtari>	hey folks.  just got a quick question.  Rather than a fresh install I chose the upgrade option and so far everything seems to have gone smoothly and the system seems to running well.  I take it my system is now the same as it would be with a clean install of 8?
[13:49	<shane2_>	slytherin, none of them worked
[13:49	<arvind_khadri>	Lainy, but why do you want it
[13:49	<nickthorley>	djones: thanks - just trying to find out if my wireless problem may be fixed in a later kernel
[13:49	<emorris>	﻿emorris: you dont need to put the /media/ in though
[13:49	<amerio>	iKernel 1st I installed madwifi , wireless worked but same problem as ndiswrapper , wireless working and no network detection
[13:49	<v0lksman>	erik__:  I have Hardy on about 5 machines and it does work...sounds like you have a package issue of some sort...
[13:49	<intrinsyx>	FooAtari: Close enough.
[13:49	<kimx>	emorris: but I need to configure a volume to be mounted on startup
[13:49	<emorris>	**kimx
[13:49	<mattycoze>	Does anyone know how to downgrade bluez-utils to ver <3.0?
[13:49	<ToM-X>	iKernel: No Message appears.
[13:50	<FooAtari>	thanks intrinsyx so nothing im missing out on or anything?
[13:50	<roocraig>	anybody help with a sound issue-headphone sound but no speaker sound?
[13:50	<iKernel>	ToM-X, ok, now try wlanconfig ath0 what does that give you
[13:50	<erik__>	where can i find log files?
[13:50	<intrinsyx>	FooAtari: Pulseaudio is now the default, so you should probably install the pa packages if you wanna manage your sound properly
[13:50	<slytherin>	mattycoze: why, is there any problem?
[13:50	<moDumassest>	my problem, any help would be awesome http://fixunix.com/ubuntu/369514-glitching-sound-ubuntu-7-10-8-04-a.html
[13:50	<nickthorley>	can anyone tell me if its possible to find out if the kernel from the media may have been patched and what was fixed
[13:50	<erik__>	the "Unknown error" error message does not help me very much
[13:50	<emorris>	﻿kimx: i know you can put it in fstab, but i dont know of a tool to do it

[13:50	<v0lksman>	erik__:  Yeah policykit needs some polishing...I think it was one of the "rushed" packages for this release...
[13:51	<amerio>	iKernel how to edit blacklist file and modprobe conf file?
[13:51	<intrinsyx>	FooAtari: And make sure you got ubuntu-desktop, that will ensure all of the default hardy packages were installed
[13:51	<mattycoze>	slytherin, nah i wanted to try something from a few years ago
=== yarddog_ is now known as yarddog

[13:52	<roocraig>	any audio/sound gurus here?
[13:52	<Fome>	Hi! I'm having some problems with the sound after installing Hardy. I think it has something to do with the new soundsystem and the fact that I have two sound cards installed..

[13:52	<Lainy>	I can no longer mark a thread as solved?

[13:52	<cgentry72>	can someone help me. i'm having a major issue with flash and firefox.  it will start playing a video and then stop.  i've restarted firefox and even reinstalled it.
[13:52	<intrinsyx>	Fome: install the pa-devchooser and select the proper default sound card, or enable simultaneous output
[13:52	<emorris>	﻿Lainy: no they are yet to enable that feature
[13:52	<ToM-X>	iKernel: Hold on I shall reboot.
[13:52	<iKernel>	ToM-X, then try iwconfig

[13:53	<iKernel>	ToM-X, yeah might not be bad idea
[13:53	<BrianB04>	Morning all: I have an oddball issue with Ubuntu. This morning I went to play a Quicktime movie. It popped up, asked if I wanted to find the right codec, it found two and I installed the FFMPEG codecs. Now, whenever I go to open another quicktime movie, it again pops up the request to search for a codec because 'The codec to play this movie is not installed'. Anyway to stop that.

[13:53	<ere4si>	NINCHNAILS: I do that - the last linux installed is the grub that is used
[13:53	<moDumassest>	arrhhhgg this is hurting my brain
[13:53	<artti>	I downloaded Ubuntu .iso file. How i should write it on cd. Some how i can't make it right.
[13:53	<arvind_khadri>	N1NCHN41L5, only if you shoot
[13:54	<iKernel>	N1NCHN41L5, omg, just throw the linux installation disk in and you can partition your existing linux partition
[13:54	<roocraig>	how do i install a flash plugin-rpm package?
[13:54	<arvind_khadri>	artti, use brasero
[13:54	<Khamael>	my wireless network adapter on my laptop stopped working after I upgraded to hardy. what can I do?
[13:54	<iKernel>	N1NCHN41L5, and then just edit /boot/grub/menu.lst

=== shane2_ is now known as shane2peru
[13:54	<iKernel>	N1NCHN41L5, and put in your other linux distribution

=== madjawa is now known as MadJawa
[13:55	<iKernel>	N1NCHN41L5, well then bad luck
[13:55	<erik__>	i tried selecting OSS in the system->prefs->sound dialogue

[13:55	<iKernel>	erik__, are you running esound?
[13:55	<iKernel>	erik__, no no no no NO
[13:55	<N1NCHN41L5>	NO you way of just install and go DOESNT work - it chewed up ubuntu grub and its own grub wouldnt load
[13:55	<ere4si>	NINCHN4IL5: k
[13:55	<iKernel>	erik__, use alsa, and ONLY alsa, everything else is crap
[13:55	<N1NCHN41L5>	leaving comp UNBOOTABLE

=== torsten is now known as Xervu
[13:56	<iKernel>	erik__, unless you're running a big music recording station, which you should probably use a mac anyway, in that case, you should probably run pulseaudio as well or something

[13:56	<erik__>	uh?
[13:56	<slytherin>	roocraig: install package flashplugin-nonfree
[13:56	<erik__>	i switched to all alsa now
[13:56	<v0lksman>	?
[13:56	<iKernel>	N1NCHN41L5, then you should've told it to not touch ubuntu's grub
[13:56	<cgentry72>	can someone help me. i'm having a major issue with flash and firefox.  it will start playing a video and then stop.  i've restarted firefox and even reinstalled it.
[13:56	<iKernel>	erik__, good
[13:56	<kimx>	there should be a disk manager? How can I start it?
[13:56	<mheath>	erik__: um, yeah...what everyone else is saying is true. oss is very similar to ALSA, but inferior, and has been obsolete (due to ALSA) for about 6 years. Don't use that. :-)
[13:56	<erik__>	do i need to restart anything to make vlc use alsa?
[13:56	<amerio>	iKernel how to remove ndiswrapper from modprobe?
[13:57	<barbarella>	kinx: have you tried gnome-volume-manager?
[13:57	<artti>	When burning image, what speed i should use?
[13:57	<Fome>	intrinsyx: they are installed... I'm not sure I understand how to continue...
[13:57	<mheath>	erik__: Your system doesn't even really support oss anymore, anyway...all that would be doing is ALSA simulating the old oss.
[13:57	<iKernel>	amerio, modprobe -r <module you want to boot up the ass and get out for just a moment while you do something else>
[13:57	<intrinsyx>	N1NCHN41L5: then reinstall ubuntu's grub. fire up the livecd, open up terminal, run sudo grub, and from the grub prompt, find /boot/grub/stage1, it'll return the device it found it on, root <device>, setup <device>
[13:57	<slytherin>	erik__: restart vlc perhaps
[13:57	<arvind_khadri>	artti, use somewhere around 4x or so to be safe
[13:57	<dagon_>	artti; as low as possible
[13:57	<erik__>	yeah, i just read this: http://fixunix.com/ubuntu/369514-glitching-sound-ubuntu-7-10-8-04-a.html

[13:57	<erik__>	describing the same problem
[13:57	<intrinsyx>	Fome: run padevchooser, and you should see a little "sheild". Click it to set a default card for output.
[13:58	<slytherin>	erik__: have you changed the option in vlc to use alsa?
[13:58	<iKernel>	ToM-X, how's it going?
[13:58	<artti>	Now it is 4th time when i try to write image on cd.
[13:58	<iKernel>	ToM-X, did you run iwconfig?
[13:58	<dooglus>	can someone please tell me how to log out of GNOME using the keyboard?
[13:58	<dagon_>	artti; what brand on cd's?
[13:59	<slytherin>	sailaway85: is that a single problem or multiple problems? Can you please rephrase your question?
[13:59	<iKernel>	dooglus, ctrl+alt+backspace
[13:59	<arvind_khadri>	sailaway85, that would needed to be looked in strace
[13:59	<dooglus>	iKernel: I want to log out of GNOME, not kill X.  any idea?
[13:59	<artti>	dragon_, Digidata CD-R
[13:59	<intrinsyx>	erik__: sudo apt-get install vlc-plugin-pulse
[13:59	<dooglus>	iKernel: I can click the little green man thing, but I can't see the dialog that pops up
[13:59	<slytherin>	dooglus: Ctrl + Alt + Delete should bring logout/shutdown dialog
[13:59	<mattycoze>	hey while i'm here, is there any way to get rid of that annoyign error beep
[13:59	<erik__>	slytherin: no, that was the problem. thanks!
[13:59	<iKernel>	dooglus, set a log out keyboard shortcut
[13:59	<dooglus>	slytherin: yes, I'm sure it does, but I can't see it
[13:59	<Fome>	intrinsyx: sorry, for being stupid, but there is no obvious place to set the default card. (after I click the thing there is a list of different options)
[13:59	<amerio>	Net_Demon anything new?
[13:59	<dooglus>	iKernel: how?
[13:59	<dagon_>	artti; tip: use tab :) it's dagon_, burn on TDK or Fujifilm, works perfect
[13:59	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, ctrl+alt+del
[14:00	<erik__>	slytherin: i thought it was grabbing the default one from gnome
[14:00	<iKernel>	dooglus, on mine it is system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts
[14:00	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: when I do that, a dialog pops up.  what next?
[14:00	<intrinsyx>	Fome: Look in your tray for an icon that looks like a plug
[14:00	<roocraig>	how do I get synaptic to download files--doesn't want to work for me
[14:00	<sailaway85>	slytherin one problem crahes when video converting.... 3d enabled and surfing with firefox .....
[14:00	<Fome>	intrinsyx: yes, I clicked that
[14:00	<erik__>	so, now it's only the administrative problem i need to solve
[14:00	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, use the log out thats it :)
[14:00	<Koheleth>	I installed the 32bit because I did not like the 64bit, now I have them both!  How do I get rid of the 64bit installation?
[14:00	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: I can't see it. can I use the keyboard to navigate that dialog?
[14:00	<Fome>	intrinsyx: but then I don't know how to continue
[14:00	<mattycoze>	oh thnk christ i fixed that
[14:00	<intrinsyx>	Fome: select Volume Control, Output devices tab, look for a little sheild
[14:01	<slytherin>	sailaway85: for video converting you will have to log a bug against the package you are using. But I haven't seen the one where FF crashes when 3d is unabled
[14:01	<iKernel>	dooglus, you'll need a mouse in order to set the keyboard short cut, btw
[14:01	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, try using tab in that box not sure whether it'll work or not
[14:01	<intrinsyx>	Right click, "Default"
[14:01	<dooglus>	iKernel: I have a mouse
[14:01	<artti>	dagon_, then i have to buy those. i hoped that i can get try new Ubuntu.

[14:01	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: I have tried, and also the arrow keys.  but I can't see the dialog, so I can't tell what those keys are doing
[14:01	<iKernel>	dooglus, then use it and set a keyboard short cut
[14:01	<slytherin>	dooglus: Can you please explain what do you mean by 'I can't see it'?
[14:01	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, what exactly is your problem
[14:01	<iKernel>	ToM-X, tell me have you run iwconfig yet?????????????????????
[14:02	<arvind_khadri>	slytherin, am on it
[14:02	<Cheesasaurus_Rex>	Hello, can someone tell me how to boot without starting X just once? I need to do this in order to reinstall the NVIDIA drivers.
[14:02	<intrinsyx>	Fome: or if you want output from both cards, click the plug, configure local sound server, simultaneous output tab, checkmark the box.
[14:02	<NeT_DeMoN>	amerio: no but im giving up
[14:02	<slytherin>	dooglus: you can simple use Alt + L to activate the logout button
[14:02	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: I want to log out.  the dialog that appears when I try to log out is in the middle of the screen.  the middle of the screen is all dead pixels, so I can't see it, and I can't move it elsewhere.  I think I need to use the keyboard
[14:02	<NeT_DeMoN>	i will just stick to hardwire or vista :(
[14:02	<moDumassest>	!audio
[14:02	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

[14:05	<slytherin>	sailaway85: that is weird, any chance it is a problem with RAM
[14:05	<mattk>	firefox and flash crash when i browse to youtube.... is this a known problem?
[14:05	<cousin_luigi>	is j2re1.4 gone for good from hardy?
[14:05	<artti>	dagon_, currently i use Ubuntu for 32-bit system but i have 64-bit system.
[14:05	<albech>	slytherin: i have tried several burning software and they seems to burn just fine, but its like the disk isnt finalized so it cannot be read
[14:05	<v0lksman>	IsotropicSpin:  naw if VLC or mplayer didn't play it then I'd say there may be something wrong with the file...can you test a different file?
[14:05	<artti>	mattk, i have same problem.
[14:05	<jerzyk86>	is somthing like deamon tools but for linux ???
[14:05	<cgentry72>	mattk, it is and i'm having sort of the same issue except mine just won't play
[14:05	<artti>	mattk, i know why is that.
[14:05	<arvind_khadri>	sailaway85, do a ram test
[14:05	<cousin_luigi>	jerzyk86: mount -o loop
[14:05	<dagon_>	artti; okey I see :) try burning as slow as possible, like 2x or 4x
[14:06	<mattk>	artti: cool, ok so we can log a bug?
[14:06	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  why?
[14:06	<artti>	I always have done that way.
[14:06	<slytherin>	albech: are you trying to burn any ubuntu image? Are you sure that image itself is not corrupt?
[14:06	<IsotropicSpin>	v0lksman: yeah i will check it out now
[14:06	<artti>	mattk, i know that flash don't work on 64-bit system.
[14:06	<cgentry72>	mattk, no, it's always been that way and i've fixed it before but can't now
[14:06	<ere4si>	cgentry72: I would think that might be a loose heatsink or fan not working - the software is there to run the vid
[14:06	<sailaway85>	slytherin: did ram check ... ok .... going to remove macrovision plugin in firefox....  and try it....
[14:06	<albech>	slytherin: yes, the image can be loaded with isomount etc. and its the latest ubuntu image
[14:06	<mysling>	ive got 64bit, and flash works fine.
[14:06	<arvind_khadri>	artti, flash works on a 64 bit one
[14:07	<nickthorley>	net_demon: i tried to install last night but it wouldnt pick up my card either - it worked fine in 7.10
[14:07	<cgentry72>	ere4si, that's kind of strange cause it's worked yesterday
[14:07	<dagon_>	v0lksman; why what?
[14:07	<arvind_khadri>	artti, sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
[14:07	<slytherin>	albech: still it would be good to verify the checksum of image.
[14:07	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: what driver you have?
[14:07	<cgentry72>	mysling, i've got 64bit also and it worked fine yesterday
[14:07	<mattk>	artti i'm not running 64 bit.... I've got the same deal as cgentry72 plays for a couple of seconds and then you lose the lot... also there is no sound at all
[14:07	<artti>	arvind_khadri, done that several times and it is said that it won't work on 64-bit system.
[14:07	<nickthorley>	net_demon: not sure - my card is intel one and used a restricted driver before
[14:07	<arvind_khadri>	artti, its works for me
[14:08	<fdr>	hi! what's the best way to edit partitions with a GUI? gparted?

[14:08	<mysling>	artti: tried 8.04?
[14:08	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  why are you telling artti to use specific brands and slow down his burn?
[14:08	<ere4si>	cgentry72: My only thought ...
[14:08	<dagon_>	v0lksman; speaking out of experience
[14:08	<bhsx>	or just use the mount command for loopback
=== weed is now known as blackness
[14:08	<slytherin>	fdr: yes
=== blackness is now known as weed
[14:08	<artti>	mysling, burning 8.04 image on disk
[14:08	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: atheros is worse, trust me ;)
[14:08	<dagon_>	v0lksman; -out of + from
[14:08	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  issues like that are completely drive specific...
[14:08	<N1NCHN41L5>	arti - or just do sudo aptitue ubuntu-restricted-extras, gives u everything
[14:08	<dagon_>	v0lksman; not always
[14:08	<mysling>	artti: im sure you will have no problems with it :D
[14:09	<sailaway85>	slytherin: also have divx web plugin ... going to remove.... could it be a memory overlap or leak?
[14:09	<timo>	hey all hardy rocks :)
[14:09	<slytherin>	sailaway85: form where did you get the divx plugin?
[14:09	<arvind_khadri>	artti, hey ok i guess there was a bug for that,but that was in 7.10 maybe the tweak can work for you
[14:09	<nickthorley>	net_demon: i think the wireless support is very bad in linux general - it always seems to be the problem area - I wouldnt mind but i would have thought intel chipset would work perfectly but it seems not
[14:09	<N1NCHN41L5>	GPARTED works GREAT - just make sure what u are trying do do (drive) isnt mounted
[14:09	<erik__>	any news on unlock button not working?
[14:09	<LainIwakura>	Hello, I just changed my openssh config, but when  I try to restart it via "sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart" it says not such file or directory. How do I restart OpenSSH then? Thanks.
[14:09	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: there's also a GUI for it called gnomeiso
[14:09	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  uhm...ok...I build machines for a living...I use cheap generic CDs on usually generic drives and haven't had issues for years....
[14:09	<pallavi>	Hi
[14:09	<artti>	Again, it is just copied .iso file to disk.
[14:09	<ha|0>	hello, I'm having trouble writing to a particular partition, but with only one program.  I have to run it as root for it to work.  Any thoughts?
[14:10	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, hi
[14:10	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: yeah, linux does suck with wireless
[14:10	<moDumassest>	daft punk sounds really scratchy, i cant seem to fix this, has anyone had sound issues thus far?
[14:10	<jerzyk86>	thx :)
[14:10	<pallavi>	I am new to ubuntu
[14:10	<ToM-X1>	Right, I'm back with my crappy WIFI problem :P
[14:10	<dagon_>	v0lksman; that's good, really. But I've had bad experience with lowprice cd's, no matter what burner I've used
[14:10	<bazhang>	moDumassest: what is that
[14:10	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: actually, it's called gmountiso
[14:10	<albech>	v0lksman: i have had experiences with disks too, where it helped to slow down the burn speed
[14:10	<pallavi>	can u please tell me how to login as a root user
[14:10	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, do you have a support question
[14:10	<moDumassest>	music is really scratchy
[14:10	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, why do you want to do that
[14:10	<cgentry72>	i'm removing anything that has to do with firefox and then reinstalling flash
[14:10	<moDumassest>	using alsa, have googled it no one knows
[14:10	<arvind_khadri>	!root
[14:10	<ubotu>	Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[14:10	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: 'sudo apt-get install gmountiso'
[14:10	<slytherin>	!tell pallavi about sudo
[14:10	<N1NCHN41L5>	pallavi SUDO
[14:10	<sailaway85>	slytherin: Actually I'm not sure... I think it came from firefox?
[14:10	<IntangibleLiquid>	if a wifi network appears in the nm-applet, does it mean that my wifi work? My wifi LED lights up during boot time then dims, is this a problem?
[14:11	<arvind_khadri>	!sudo | pallavi
[14:11	<ubotu>	pallavi: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information.
[14:11	<nickthorley>	net_demon: i used to use fedora but when got a laptop it wouldnt work with wireless and thus tried ubuntu which worked first time so was really happy but then new version of ubuntu comes out and no support  - great
[14:11	<albech>	v0lksman: cant say anything about disks since they are mostly produced on the same factories, just added different logos
[14:11	<pallavi>	because when i am trying to copy folders it is saying operation not permitted
[14:11	<v0lksman>	albech:  I'm not saying you WON'T have issues...but since we don't know what make/model artti has it seems silly to jump the gun and tell him to slow it down and buy new CDs
[14:11	<moDumassest>	!alsa
[14:11	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[14:12	<spiniker>	any ideas?
[14:12	<pallavi>	i am not pasteing into root folder
[14:12	<brackettt>	hello, upgraded ubuntu yesterday, now it wont make it past the login screen anything i can do?
[14:12	<v0lksman>	dagon_ albech:  All I'm saying is the best way to know is to try burning at full speed on the disks you have...If that doesn't work then try slowing it down...if that fails then maybe look at new media...
[14:12	<ha|0>	hello, I'm having trouble writing to a particular partition, but with only one program.  I have to run it as root for it to work.  Any thoughts?

[14:13	<T4NK3R>	hi
[14:13	<albech>	v0lksman: but slowing down the burn is not a bad suggestion, and it definitely wont cause more failures ;)
[14:13	<ari_stress>	hi guys, just installed hardy. but i cannot install build-essential, has anyone experience the same?
[14:13	<artti>	I hope that Ubuntu 8.04(32-bit) works fine on AMD64.
[14:13	<crashanddie>	IntangibleLiquid, check your syslog to see if you have any changes when using the function key
[14:13	<pallavi>	sorry i made a mistake
[14:13	<skyowner>	hi
[14:13	<N1NCHN41L5>	sudo aptitude install is easier
[14:13	<pallavi>	what i am trying to say is
[14:13	<v0lksman>	artti:  it does.... :)
[14:14	<LainIwakura>	ifireball: Well, I added "ServerAliveInterval 120" to ssh_config, so I thought I needed to restart it so the changes will go into effect. But there is no ssh restart...
[14:14	<skyowner>	i don't understand one thing, is UBUNTU 8.04 compatible with standart French Packages
[14:14	<skyowner>	?
[14:14	<arvind_khadri>	ari_stress, put in the cd and install build-essential
[14:14	<titan_>	I updated to hardy herron today but when it restarted it just gives me a load of text for an hour then hangs, i had to put the 7.10 live cd back in
[14:14	<v0lksman>	albech:  not when you are eager to get going and you have to wait 45 minutes for a burn... :)
[14:14	<LainIwakura>	ifireball: I am not running a ssh server on this computer, so I don't think I need  openssh-server

[14:17	<arthur>	@ artti : I will try - thanks!
[14:17	<timo>	yeh sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a
[14:17	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: yes, its a client directive, essentially /etc/ssh_config is the system-wide client configuration file, changes to it will take place the next time you run the client (e.g. the next time you run an "ssh" command)

[14:18	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: however, I think its a better practive to make client-side changes in your own home directory e.g. in the ~/.ssh/config file
[14:18	<Al00>	Anyone else having this issue?
[14:18	<LainIwakura>	ifireball: So restarting ssh is only applicable if I'm running a server.. and the changes I made to ssh_config will take effect once I run a "ssh" command? Thanks.

[14:21	<sanozuke>	thank you
[14:21	<CTankred>	Hi guys, does the new screen resolution tool works for you? Doesn't detect any sec. monitors here
[14:21	<slytherin>	arthur: icedtea packages lack some classes like sound. So may not work with every applet
[14:21	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, did that work??
[14:21	<slytherin>	﻿Itaku: it is not necessary it will work. if it was made for oracle you need oracle installation on your machine.

[14:22	<sanozuke>	thanks
[14:22	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, the problem is that at a kernel update it will break the module and the laptop won't have graphics ....and that is VERY problematic
[14:22	<nickthorley>	gord_: well i cant get a wilress connection in 7.10 it came up asking if I would like to use a restricted driver which worked perfectly but in 8.04 this seems to have been removed for some strange reason - It may be available in a patched kernel or via other patches but I dont know this unless I install I guess
[14:22	<Itaku>	uh ive seen this in my terminal for the past 5 mins. 0% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.88.31)]

[14:22	<ndy>	bazhang: burned the ubuntu cd two times .. will try another one :)
[14:22	<slytherin>	bhsx: no, you are certainly using something other than icedtea. Check 'java -version'
[14:22	<bhsx>	Itaku: it's because the servers are getting SLAMMED

[14:22	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  with envy or just when you install manually?
[14:22	<slytherin>	Heroin: what with that?
[14:23	<Itaku>	well crap
[14:23	<Heroin>	slytherin: the encryption option in gnome.. in the filemanager

[14:23	<pallavi>	but i am not able to view the contents in it
[14:23	<loder>	can I ask are many people trying the lazy way of upgrading to Heron or are you all being sensible and backing up and starting fresh. i always used to do a fresh install as awindows user, but I'm told aptitude especially does avery good job?
[14:23	<gord_>	 nickthorley : ah ok got u now, yep use the live CD to install a system, THEN solve the wireless probem, do u have a a wireD network connection on the machine?
[14:23	<slytherin>	Heroin: ever heard of gnupg?
[14:23	<bazhang>	nickthorley that card not working?

[14:24	<bazhang>	loder well not really lazy; just like to continue on--your way is fine too though

[14:24	<bhsx>	openjdk-6-jre, that is
[14:24	<nickthorley>	gord_: yes I do.  how can i install patches and test though when the patches may need a reboot?

[14:25	<jojomas>	so, funny thing happened partition editor doesn't detect my partitions, but i can see them from nautilus. je, I can't get past the LiveCD
[14:25	<Voxxi>	nickthorley : Apparently, according to the linux wireless list, its fully supported. What have you tried to get it working
[14:25	<N1NCHN41L5>	Anyone Know How to DUAL BOOT Multiple Linux OS"S??????
[14:25	<nickthorley>	bazhang: unfortunately cant tell you as not with the machine at the moment
[14:25	<slytherin>	bhsx: yes, that is different from icedtea-java-7 packages. But even openjdk is not complete AFAIK,
[14:25	<sanozuke>	whooo
[14:25	<loder>	bazhang i am thinking of doing that actually - Gutsy does everytihng I need and I actually rely on it as my main system now so I loathe to mess with awinning formula
[14:25	<arstanj>	hi all, is the ubuntu repos lagging? does anybody experiencing this?
[14:25	<slytherin>	N1NCHN41L5: grub installation wil take care of it
[14:25	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  may want to check with him in the forums though....Envy has been flawless for me with ATI in the past and so far with NG and nVidia it's been ok...but no kernel updates yet... ;)

[14:25	<nickthorley>	voxxi: i havent tried anything - it was autodetected before and I cant see why the driver should have been removed from a later version of the os - seems like a backward step to me

[14:26	<artenius>	N1NCHN41L5: grub

[14:26	<afallenhope>	anyone know how I can completely restore Ubuntu? I don't know the partitions.. I just did the desktop installation. I want to reinstall. I jacked up all my modules some how.
[14:26	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I have the exact same card and it works very well once you get it going--when you have a chance perhpas you can troubleshhot it
[14:26	<gord_>	 nickthorley : ah, i meant actually INTALL the system onto hard disk using the live CD, but do u just want to test it witout disturbing the hard disk? not easy at all that way....
[14:26	<Sajuukkhar>	same here
[14:26	<JPSmon>	what would happen if I ran wubi with wine???
[14:26	<N1NCHN41L5>	artenius - GRUB is my only problem
[14:26	<Sajuukkhar>	i want to know what partitions i require to have
[14:26	<slytherin>	N1NCHN41L5: and please don't use all caps. It is considered as shouting.
[14:26	<arstanj>	immeys: thanks, so its not only my network
[14:26	<mattycoze>	How do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[14:26	<sanozuke>	how to you guys and girls read so fast
[14:26	<IndyGunFreak>	JPSmon: lol, i think it would create a comedy of errors
[14:26	<Sajuukkhar>	we dont
[14:26	<bazhang>	loder well I would stick with gutsy until 804.1 if you know what I mean
[14:26	<Heroin>	slytherin:  what is gnupg?
[14:26	<immesys>	sanozuke: you don't you just look for your name and the name of the person you're talking to
[14:26	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, the problem is that i must finish the upgrade as soon as possible...so i don't know how long it'll take before having a response in the forums...
=== halo is now known as hal0

[14:27	<JPSmon>	LOL, how?
[14:27	<bazhang>	!tab | sanozuke
[14:27	<Voxxi>	nickthorley: Maybe it was detected correctly, but not configured properly. Does it show up under the System >	Admin >	Network?
[14:27	<ubotu>	sanozuke: You can use <tab>	for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[14:27	<nickthorley>	gord_: ok no prob - will just have to install and then if cant get it working revert back to 7.10
[14:27	<N1NCHN41L5>	was only partly caps so they know its not M$ dual boot - text moves so fast
[14:27	<slytherin>	Heroin: it is implementation of public-key cryptography
[14:27	<IndyGunFreak>	evand: you really think so?.. i seriously doubt it would
[14:27	<jojomas>	well.. lets all do a fresh install of 7.10, and then upgrade to 8.04... this is feeling like windows man
[14:27	<bhsx>	slytherin: that's interesting.. i hadn't realized that.... i'm actually uninstalling and installing sun-java6-plugin to see if i can tell a difference on any applets
[14:27	<mattycoze>	How do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[14:27	<JPSmon>	evand, would i dual boot my linux?
[14:27	<fysa>	is there a Wubi channel?

[14:27	<fysa>	I boot into initramfs every time.
[14:27	<slytherin>	pallavi: you may want to join #ubuntu-in. You have high chance of getting answers there
[14:28	<ifireball>	mattycoze: try using it?
[14:28	<evand>	JPSmon: IndyGunFreak I've seen it with my own eyes.  The lead developer works in Ubuntu, it's kind of a necessity.  But it's only useful for testing that it created the right things and put them in the right place.
[14:28	<pallavi>	ya Thanks for assistance
[14:28	<sanozuke>	you guys
[14:28	<gord_>	 nickthorley : yep but not too hard to install then configure stuff once it's on your disk, but near-impossibkle to remaster a live-cd that way for specific card u see
[14:28	<dassouki>	when i do an lsb_release -a i get 8.04 hardy !
[14:28	<nickthorley>	bazhang: what did you have to do to get it going - I think we need to get out of having to "fix" it - if it auto worked before then why not in a later version - I love linux and want to get more people into it but if the way to get your card working is to play with kernel modules then i cant help but thinking we are going backwards not forwards
[14:28	<sanozuke>	are a lot of time online
[14:28	<evand>	fysa: no, just a forum and website.
[14:28	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  I'm not sure how installing the drivers manually is going to help though...no matter what when you install a new kernel you need to create the modules for it...Envy does it for you while the "Ubuntu" way (which isn't cause Ubuntu Way means no proprietary software) you have to do it by hand....
[14:28	<halll0>	can anyone help with a permissions problem I'm having?
[14:28	<N1NCHN41L5>	yes /j #wubi - only 1 person in it now
[14:28	<IndyGunFreak>	evand: well, i'd have to see that to believe it
[14:28	<ibleed>	how do i encrypt a partition that requires me to give a password when i want to access it (not on boot but manually) ?
[14:28	<bazhang>	nickthorley: this is hardy right?
[14:28	<loder>	IndyGunFreak it might even work though - that very last version of Wine is startlingly good - it even runs Dreamweaver with bit of tweaking now - that amazed me!
[14:28	<nickthorley>	gord_: no prob - thanks for your help - will install it tonight
[14:28	<nickthorley>	bazhang: yes hardy
[14:29	<sanozuke>	how to i use tab to search for program
[14:29	<JPSmon>	evand: So there wouldnt be a dual boot then?
[14:29	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  I honestly think EnvyNG will fix your upgrade issue though...the app is more closely integrated for Hardy then it was in the past...he worked with Ubuntu devs to make a lot happen...
[14:29	<evand>	IndyGunFreak: bzr branch lp:wubi wubi; cd wubi; make prerequisites; make; make test
[14:29	<evand>	JPSmon: I'm not sure I understand your question.  Can you elaborate on what you want to accomplish?
[14:29	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, what i mean by ubuntu way is trough the restricted hardware gui which install the nvidia module package wich would be updated if the kernel is updated
[14:29	<neeto>	How do I set the color depth in 8.04?
[14:29	<bazhang>	nickthorley: they moved from the ipw3945 to the iwl3945 and the transition has been a bit rocky; but the new kernel level module means no restricted driver and much better performance
[14:30	<nullmind>	neeto: you still have to use xorg.conf :-/
[14:30	<loder>	Is there a search in this chan where i can look up things I don't know like what EnvyNG is?
[14:30	<slytherin>	sanozuke: what do you mean?
[14:30	<ifireball>	sanozuke: you start typing its name in the command line and then press tab, it should then either complete the name or give you completion options
[14:30	<Adlai>	!envy | loder
[14:30	<ubotu>	loder: envy is an unsupported tool to install newer versions of binary video drivers than provided by the official repositories. Use at your own risk, and remember that the latest version is not necessarily the "best". See « /msg ubotu binarydriver »
[14:30	<JPSmon>	evand: eh not really.  its just a joke.    I feel like I would be dividing by zero somwhere

[14:31	<bhsx>	look at it this way... there are 1500 ppl IN HERE
[14:31	<nickthorley>	gord_: yes i fully understand - is it possible that after installing and patching the card may be auto detected and work - the updates fixing it or is this highly unlikely?

[14:34	<nullmind>	grnmtn: you can always use $man
[14:34	<gord_>	  nickthorley : possible, more likely u need to google for, for example, {card name) ubuntu hardy and do somethin manually
[14:34	<lilg111111>	bhsx, i have it already
[14:34	<nullmind>	loder: im always joking :)
[14:35	<elektronik123>	can i backup Pidgin`s conversation logs ?

[14:35	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I will do my best to be around; will try to remember what exactly I did--not much really though ( acoup;e of tweaks iirc)
[14:35	<alteregoa>	i need a strange help

[14:35	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: I don't understand what you mean by 'get into firefox'
[14:35	<grnmtn>	nullmind: I'm looking for install guides . . . so I'm not to the man stage yet
[14:35	<bazhang>	alteregoa: go ahead and ask
[14:35	<albech>	where can i find the md5sums on the ubuntu website?
[14:35	<bhsx>	lilg111111: and it doesn't work?
[14:35	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: well I have it installed but firefox doesn't show it installed.
[14:35	<neeto>	24 bit color depth is not including the 8 bit alpha channel, right?
[14:35	<alteregoa>	i connected two screens to the ubuntumachine
[14:35	<iluminatus>	who i must configured xchat for using a bnc ??? problem ident ... i need help in german ^^
[14:35	<slytherin>	elektronik123: manual backup? yes. Open terminal and check directory ~/.purple/logs
[14:35	<nullmind>	grnmtn: Ubuntu has a good Wiki
[14:35	<alteregoa>	but it doesn't work as it should
[14:35	<bazhang>	!md5 | albech
[14:35	<ubotu>	albech: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[14:35	<loder>	nullmind I take it Final Fanatasy is agame? the software I'venever heard of is always game related :(
[14:35	<lilg111111>	bhsx, nope just a black screen shows up with the replay button but no video plays
[14:35	<nullmind>	grnmtn: you can also browse the packages online and download their docs
[14:35	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes mac-changer usuall opnly last during one boot, changin g mac confuses everything, so u mets ask for new IP by recycling the network, eg: disable it and reeneble it should work for dhcp
[14:36	<shane2peru>	ifireball, nullmind I have xubuntu installed now, and it is ok, but I just like gnome too much, too used to gnome.  Thanks
[14:36	<bhsx>	lilg111111: you restarted FF?
[14:36	<bazhang>	alteregoa: you need to use my nick if you want an answer thanks
[14:36	<gord_>	so u must#
[14:36	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: where did you check it?
[14:36	<alteregoa>	it has only 640x480 resol. i cannot change the resolution to 1024x768 on the second screen
[14:36	<lilg111111>	bhsx, yes
[14:36	<afallenhope>	Does Ubuntu work well with SATA hard drives?
[14:36	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: the addons.
[14:36	<bazhang>	afallenhope: sure
[14:36	<b33r>	what's the md5sum of hardy amd64 desktop?
[14:36	<shane2peru>	slytherin, I forgot the package name that is why I was trying the gnome-desktop etc.
[14:36	<alteregoa>	yes with sado drives, it wors
[14:36	<nullmind>	b33r: it's on the ubuntu release package
[14:36	<shane2peru>	slytherin, thanks though.
[14:36	<bhsx>	lilg111111: this SHOULDn't have anything to do with it... but try 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras'
[14:36	<arthur>	@ afallenhope ... yeah SATA should be no problem
[14:36	<nickthorley>	bazhang: thanks for your help
[14:37	<grnmtn>	nullimind: I'm trying to set up separate partitions, so I guess 8.04 docs aren't necessary (I doubt that has changed) - but I can't find any decent documentaiton on manually partitioning ubuntu server
[14:37	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: Are you checking 'plugins' or 'extensions'?
[14:37	<loder>	afallenhope I don't know what constitutes well but it certainly works on mine
[14:37	<gord_>	indian_munnda: so use macchanger, then  go to network icon on top toolbar then disbale then reenable it
[14:37	<bazhang>	not yet nickthorley ;]
[14:37	<indian_munnda>	gord_: but i m running a DNS server with a public IP thats why i m looking for MAC changer.
[14:37	<nickthorley>	gord_: you too - hope to be chatting later via wireless
[14:37	<joshua__>	hey guys
[14:37	<bhsx>	ok, enjoy everyone, this is too busy for me to be much help
[14:37	<nullmind>	grnmtn: are you going to use the Live CD to install, it has GParted a GNOME-based partition editor that is very sexy
[14:37	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: both
[14:37	<joshua__>	im a i have a quick question
[14:37	<joshua__>	im a newb
[14:37	<joshua__>	and i have hardy
[14:37	<nullmind>	never ask to ask or talk about asking
[14:37	<lilg111111>	bhsx, already have that to, should i uninstall em and reinstall them
[14:37	<RWB>	could someone give me a link to the release info on Hardy?
[14:37	<bazhang>	go ahead joshua__ easy on the enter key though
[14:37	<alteregoa>	a mac changer, so you had a power pc mac, and now you try to change to intel?
[14:37	<immesys>	joshua__: just ask
[14:38	<greentomate>	when will archive.ubuntu be back up??? I can/t get any packages as of now and it is quite frustrating.
[14:38	<[T]-Rex>	lol
[14:38	<joshua__>	I am running dual boot with vista 64 and when i installed hardy i could read my ntfs data
[14:38	<jhoc2x>	how are thing between hardy and gutsy??? i'd like to know before upgrading to hardy
[14:38	<loder>	It is busy actually - the busiest I've ever seen any IRC channel in my life!
[14:38	<ere4si>	joshua__: just ask your qustion - it gets busy here
[14:38	<nullmind>	greentomate: go to Admin->Software sources and choose a local mirror
[14:38	<alteregoa>	i have no glue with xorg.conf
[14:38	<bazhang>	rwb www.fsckin.com has the best one (in Plain English)
[14:38	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: have you restarted firefox? Any chance you are using firefox2 instead of firefox3.
[14:38	<immesys>	joshua__: thats a feature
[14:38	<nullmind>	greentomate: im in Portland, OR and choose cat.pdx down the street :)
[14:38	<afallenhope>	what about an Asus vid card?
[14:38	<LainIwakura>	I cannot find the artwiz package in the hardy repositories. How do I find which respoistory to add so that I can apt-get xfonts-artwiz2?
[14:38	<joshua__>	now it says cannot mount
[14:38	<RWB>	thnx
[14:38	<slytherin>	greentomate: use local mirror please
[14:38	<greentomate>	nullmind: i'll give that a shot, thanks.
[14:38	<greentomate>	yes yes ill try
[14:39	<grnmtn>	nullmind: ubuntu server livecd doesn't appear to include gparted
[14:39	<vbabiy-laptop>	no slytherin its firefox 3
[14:39	<bazhang>	afallenhope: what chipset
[14:39	<immesys>	joshua__: its probably because the ntfs journal is dirty. reboot into windows and shut down nicely
[14:39	<gord_>	indian_munnda: aha, so ion that case u need to recycle the fixed IP, anyone help with a foolproff method in hardy? no box here on 8.04 to talk him thru.. :(
[14:39	<joshua__>	I downloaded and installed a ntfs3g thing and i guess that i didnt need it for hardy, but since installing that i have no access
[14:39	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: perhaps a firefox restart is needed
[14:39	<arthur>	@ slytherin: What else is to do for Firefox Java then "sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre" ?
[14:39	<grnmtn>	i'm sort of shocked that they would release 8.04 without update documentation at the same time
[14:39	<q4a>	hi to all, I want to install ubuntu on laptop Samsung Q45 F000. I tried to do it with 7.10 and 8.04 - but i can't: it fades at attempt to start from a disk without installation. Whether it is possible to try to start ubuntu from USB flash drive and how? Or some one can already have the same problem?
[14:39	<nullmind>	grnmtn: yes, the Ubuntu Desktop does include GParted
[14:39	<joshua__>	i tried removing it in synaptic, however it didnt work
[14:39	<afallenhope>	965wh
[14:39	<vbabiy-laptop>	sorry slytherin I didn't notice I had firefox open on a different desktop
[14:39	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i m running gutsy
[14:40	<vbabiy-laptop>	so it was not restarting
[14:40	<greentomate>	another question: how do i make it so i dont have to type root password all the time. Isn't there a way to have it autofilled? i mean, i understand why it wants to prompt you, but why should i have to actually type a pw in as supposed to hitting "OK Proceed"
[14:40	<joshua__>	removing it worked
[14:40	<nullmind>	grnmtn: you can always use the parted application for command-line partitioning
[14:40	<pawan>	hi
[14:40	<joshua__>	but ntfs didnt
[14:40	<bazhang>	grnmtn: they did you just need to look for it: www.distrowatch.com has the official one
[14:40	<slytherin>	arthur: you also need sun-java6-plugin :-D
[14:40	<gord_>	indian_munnda: u see the moment u change the MAC all your network switches get confused, they try to talk to the OLD mac, in their arp-caches i think
[14:40	<pawan>	how to download videos from youtube
[14:40	<dwhsix>	Hardy upgrade Q: I torrented the alternate CD, burned it, but when did the upgrade it seems to be downloading everything from the new and not using the CD...
[14:40	<joshua__>	so i reinstalled it and it still doesnt work
[14:40	<arthur>	@ slytherin : oh ^^
[14:40	<immesys>	joshua__: have you tried manually mounting the drive?
[14:40	<frostburn>	anyone having issues compiling vmware server on 64bit 8.04?
[14:40	<nullmind>	joshua__: do you know how to open a terminal?
[14:40	<joshua__>	not sure how
[14:40	<bhsx>	ok i will say this for anyone having troubles with FROSTWIRE or LIMEWIRE....   over the course of the beta, and including the final release...  install the FrostWire .deb.  then 'gksudo gedit /usr/bin/FrostWire' and make the file '#!/bin/bash  -  cd /usr/lib/frostwire - java -jar FrostWire.jar' then 'sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/FrostWire' then just type (or create a shortcut) for 'FrostWire' and it will run just fine...
[14:40	<gord_>	indian_munnda: k, gutsy then anyone?

[14:40	<joshua__>	terminal yes
[14:40	<joshua__>	brb i have to help my daughter
[14:40	<dwhsix>	(this /may/ be because I started an upgrade and said 'yes, do the updates now', but then cancelled that and started over...)
[14:40	<afallenhope>	 
[14:40	<moDumass>	booya. the solution to cracly sound is to turn the application your usings volume down to 70% but turn up your master, it removes the crackling static scratchy clicks
[14:40	<moDumass>	awesometastic
[14:40	<loder>	q4a that's the odd thing there are some systems - I have one - that won't do livecds - but will install from install cds fine
[14:40	<pawan>	i am using gutsy
[14:41	<arthur>	@ slytherin there is no sun-java6-plugin
[14:41	<grnmtn>	bazhang: if you look at https://help.ubuntu.com/, it is all 7.10 or older
[14:41	<loder>	someone told me it can be because the system ram isn't fast enough
[14:41	<bazhang>	sudo apt-get install youtube-dl pawan then in the terminal youtube-dl (the url of the vid you want here)
[14:41	<bhsx>	arthur yes, there is
[14:41	<joshua__>	ok im back
[14:41	<bazhang>	grnmtn: it is one day since the release and we are all volunteers please be patient that is a huge amount to update
[14:41	<nullmind>	greentomate: you want to change the sudo timeout
[14:41	<immesys>	joshua__: ok do you know the /dev/ name of your drive?
[14:41	<gord_>	indian_munnda: basically, i think u just do this, run macchanger, go up to network-manager icon on top toolbar, disable networking, then do it again to enable networking
=== v0lksman-away is now known as v0lksman
[14:42	<bhsx>	arthur: it's called 'sun-java6-plugin' i'm looking at it right now in Synaptic

[14:42	<arthur>	@ bhsx do I have to use "software from 3rd part"
[14:42	<bazhang>	loder more likely a video or acpi issue; you might try with the acpi=off boot parameter
[14:42	<bhsx>	arthur: it installs sun-java6-jre and sun-java6-bin
[14:42	<LainIwakura>	I could install a package with the Gutsy repositories. How do I install that package in Hardy?
[14:42	<immesys>	joshua__: join #tmp32
[14:42	<Fritzel>	where should I go to look for new themes and backgrounds?
[14:42	<grnmtn>	bazhang: I understand the nature of community work, but for a distro that is trying succeed on a commerical level, it is unprofessional - they shouldn't have released the distro until the docs were ready
[14:42	<elektronik123>	8.04 isn`t good translate into polish
[14:42	<bhsx>	you should have universe and multiverse checked by default
[14:43	<methods>	can i upgrade to the new version from my desktop ?
[14:43	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  I was thinking of checking the FAQ for the answer... :)
[14:43	<arthur>	@ bshx I both got them installed
[14:43	<loder>	bazhang actually that sounds right - at least on that system I always have to force acpi on and off in the modules
[14:43	<grnmtn>	bazhang: anyway, I'm not trying to bash ubuntu, I love it, but I was a little suprised. And I greatly appreciate all the work that goes in to it
[14:43	<carl>	anyone having any issues updating, in the update manager it gives me a button to update to 8.04 but when i click it i get the loading icon nothing happens??
[14:43	<q4a>	loder, thx, i'll try

[14:43	<loder>	Yeah that must be it at least on mine
[14:43	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, ok and thanks a lot!!!

[14:49	<dystopianray>	arthur: update your package list
[14:49	<dystopianray>	Cusoon959: try it without disabling ssb, other drivers use ssb too

[14:52	<^^malajenho^>	hi everyone, I've installed hardy heron by first time. How can I configure my wireless device BROADCOM4318 to work fine ??
=== falk_ is now known as Lamia55
[14:52	<dystopianray>	LainIwakura: oh sorry i thought you mentioned xfonts-artwiz2 earlier
[14:53	<bazhang>	Sajuukkhar: ask away
[14:53	<LainIwakura>	dystopianray: Yeah sorry typo
[14:53	<hardff>	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+bug/218750/  what do you do about it??
[14:53	<Sajuukkhar>	i tried doing the automatic guided install for partition
[14:53	<rebooting every 1/2 hour or so might become a bit of a pain
[19:04	<with a particular ISP yeah?
[14:53	<jburd>	^^malajenho^: Terrible card.
[14:53	<Sajuukkhar>	and it couldnt work
[14:53	<loder>	LainIwakura it will be the repository for gutsy preceded by deb
[14:53]  * jburd doesn't like anything broadcom.
[14:53	<ayilma1>	did hardy fix the suspend problem?
[14:53	<loder>	just like alkl the other urls
[14:53	<LainIwakura>	loder: How do I find the exact url for that?
[14:53	<loder>	it's awhile since i did it
[14:53	<dystopianray>	ayilma1: which suspend problem?
[14:53	<neeto>	Is anyone else using one of the new mac keyboards?
[14:53	<Theo_>	Why wont grub boot my windows or ubuntu? It says selected disk does not exist.
[14:53	<Sajuukkhar>	it just says cant partition it and takes me back to the partition table
[14:53	<jburd>	^^malajenho^: Use the Windows wireless drivers if you can't get the Linux builtins working
[14:53	<ayilma1>	suspend in laptops..
[14:53	<kennethr>	How do I know that I've got the latest Hardy installed?  I jumped on at a beta and I just want to verify that I've got the released bits installed.
[14:53	<LainIwakura>	not in backports
[14:53	<loder>	LainIwakura hang on I have to look everything up
[14:54	<Jessid>	what does it mean OSE at the end of the name of VirtualBox????
[14:54	<LainIwakura>	loder: Thanks.
[14:54	<bazhang>	Theo_: which was intalled frist windows or ubuntu
[14:54	<dystopianray>	ayilma1: you'll have to be much more specific
[14:54	<loder>	it might be LainIwakura
[14:54	<dystopianray>	Jessid: open source edition
[14:54	<Sajuukkhar>	i been trying to fix my laptop a day and a half
[14:54	<neeto>	Is anyone else using one of the new mac keyboards?
[14:54	<nullmind>	ayilma1: what doesnt work w/ suspend?
[14:54	<bazhang>	jessid open source edition iirc
[14:54	<dystopianray>	Jessid: it lacks usb, rdp and iscsi support but is otherwise identical
[14:54	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: thanks a lot!!!
[14:54	<Theo_>	windows and ubunto over 7.10 which was on a different hd in the computer
[14:54	<v0lksman>	kennethr:  either run update manager or sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get upgrade
[14:54	<bullium>	did anyone else see the new border that was on the menus during the beta versions of hard/
[14:54	<ayilma1>	suspend was not working for many models in gutsy
[14:54	<Itaku>	i have to apt-get something but i cant because it cant connect. is there another way?
[14:54	<gord_>	kennethr: update with update-manager if no uodates found u are current, servers busy though
[14:54	<Jessid>	﻿bazhang: thanks a lot
[14:54	<LainIwakura>	dystopianray: Is it okay if I add the gutsy universe repository line in my sources.list in order to install that xfonts-artwiz package?
[14:54	<bazhang>	itaku what is the error
[14:54	<cpu>	bazhang.. k ty for co-oprate.. so I will find is that from my distro or the ubuntu works... so I wanted to ask is it a critical error or what !! .. I cant make restart
[14:55	<dystopianray>	LainIwakura: i wouldn't think so, no
[14:55	<bricas>	Hello all. I'm trying to remove my dependencies on kde app -- anyone ever done any switch from (1) Digikam to F-Spot and (2) Amarok to Rhythmbox? I don't want to lose my tags/ratings.
[14:55	<ere4si>	Itaku: why can't it connect?
[14:55	<libervisco>	Does engmail work on evolution?
[14:55	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: does not support USB???mmm too bad. Some plans to support it???
[14:55	<LainIwakura>	dystopianray: How do I get that package then? Thanks.
[14:55	<nullmind>	Why doe Firefox 3.0 have tall fonts?
[14:55	<indian_munnda_>	gord_: actually i m having two computers and when i try to use the network on the other one it does not work because ISP needs my registered MAC.
[14:55	<dystopianray>	Jessid: if you want usb support get the non open source edition off the virtualbox website
[14:55	<bazhang>	cpu sorry missed your first question; is what a critical error
[14:55	<ere4si>	Itaku: does it time out?
[14:56	<dystopianray>	LainIwakura: no idea, find out why it's not included in hardy
[14:56	<kennethr>	v0lksman: gord_: There's no way to actually verify that all of the packages are "release" bits, though?
[14:56	<LainIwakura>	Also, is it recommended to downgrade firefox? I can not use any of the plugins.
[14:56	<Sajuukkhar>	ok i wipe the entire harddirve and let it run: this is what i get: ext3 file system creation in partition #1 os SCSI1 (0.0.0) (sda) failed.
[14:56	<LainIwakura>	dystopianray: Alright.. thanks.
[14:56	<jhoc2x_>	grabe.. 510ms man ang LAG
[14:56	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: i am reading it, but they dont have for ubuntu 8.04 yet
[14:56	<nullmind>	Lainlwakura: Disable the "Version Check" in about:config
[14:56	<dystopianray>	Jessid: do you need to use the usb support in virtualbox?
[14:56	<LainIwakura>	nullmind: Great, thanks.
[14:56	<cpu>	bazhang , I think I just can stay with my current situation with the distro ...
[14:56	<nullmind>	Lainlwakura: Google Toolbar for example works fine once I did that
[14:56	<Sake>	how come ca.archive.ubuntu.com times out when I try to apt-get install packages?
[14:57	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes ok, but u realise that two devices cannot exist at the same time using one single mac address, ie bothturnedon and plugged into network...in case u have that going on
[14:57	<cpu>	bazhang .. and I cant do anything .. so I'm just tryin' to make another upgrade
[14:57	<dystopianray>	!slow | Sake
[14:57	<ubotu>	Sake: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of the latest edition. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[14:57	<nullmind>	Sake Use a local mirror in Admin->Software Sources
[14:57	<bazhang>	cpu okay if you specify the problem we may find a solution but ath is up to you
[14:57	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: yes, I have to "burn" some microcontrollers using windows and i prefer to run it under linux
[14:57	<eltech>	whys it so difficult to install something like gdesklets afer install?
[14:57	<Itaku>	ere4si: yeah it times out
[14:57	<Sake>	nullmind: I'm using ubuntu server, don't have a gui
[14:57	<Itaku>	oh wait it finally installed
[14:57	<eltech>	seem slike all the repos are not reachable or something
[14:57	<cguillermo>	Sajuukkhar: did partition-editor recognize all your partitions?
[14:57	<agari>	how long does the apt upgrade take?
[14:57	<bazhang>	eltech the servers are slow at the moment
[14:57	<indian_munnda_>	gord_: yes i know that and i use only one device at a time.
[14:57	<dystopianray>	Jessid: i'm not sure if there will ever be usb support in the open source edition
[14:57	<PMantis>	cdimage.ubuntu.com is timing out for me, too...
[14:57	<Sajuukkhar>	its wiped them all and done it itself
[14:57	<cpu>	bazhang.. ahhh ok .. ty .. I will report about if it repeated.. ty at all
[14:57	<Sajuukkhar>	i think thats what 'guided' means
[14:58	<eltech>	ah ok i thought it was me
[14:58	<NibiruET>	Anyone running Ubuntu in a VirtualBox?
[14:58	<ere4si>	Itaku: the servers are under a heavy load atm - give it a day
[14:58	<PMantis>	I only want an 8.04 jeos torrent link. Anyone have one?
[14:58	<jburd>	indian_munnda_: Get a switch and set up a proxy on the machine already registered.
[14:58	<spiniker>	my upgrade took about 7 hours
[14:58	<eltech>	bazhang but if I dl the .deb file why is it still looking for repo?
=== crummygummy_ is now known as CrummyGummy
[14:58	<Sajuukkhar>	lol
[14:58	<Sajuukkhar>	7 hours
[14:58	<Joelito>	Thanks dystopianray, that help me :)
[14:58	<gord_>	 kennethr: not really, but u can be sure they are "current" ie, up to date/hour/minute
[14:58	<spiniker>	yup
[14:58	<indian_munnda_>	gord_; i did ifconfig -a and it gave me info of all devices
[14:58	<bazhang>	eltech which deb file
[14:58	<Sajuukkhar>	mine is taking me past the 36 hour mark
[14:58	<eltech>	gdesklets
[14:58	<cguillermo>	Sajuukkhar: yes, but. sometimes you cant see all partitions if you havent shutdown windows correctly
[14:58	<PMantis>	spiniker: Would've been quicker to download the alternate or DVD via torrent, and upgrade with local disc. :)
[14:58	<damo22>	when i use 2.6.24 kernel it crashes
[14:58	<spiniker>	really
[14:58	<cguillermo>	but... thats not the case
[14:59	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: ok man. I hope they do...meanwhile, lets enjoy new Ubuntu, jejeje...Thanks a lot! By the way, do you know how to change the name of the disks shown in the desktop???
[14:59	<Sajuukkhar>	windows isnt installed on here
[14:59	<eimajentha1>	stupid question: why is my root (i.e. mounted at "/") partition commented out in /etc/fstab?  I'm running Ubuntu Server 8.04, and it's working fine, but that seems odd to me.
[14:59	<spiniker>	men i guess i was lucky enough
[14:59	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ok, so the physiocal address is the new one u specified on macchanger then?
[14:59	<bazhang>	eltech likely because it has dependencies--best to waiut and get from the repos
[14:59	<eltech>	k
[14:59	<dystopianray>	Jessid: not in ubuntu, no
[14:59	<gord_>	indian_munnda:...for the specific network card u are using, or eth0 if u only have one network card/nic
[14:59	<SeanTater>	If there is this much lag at this market share, what will it be like when everyone uses ubuntu?
[15:00	<Sajuukkhar>	can i make my own partitions
[15:00	<indian_munnda_>	gord_: are talking about the hardware address?
[15:00	<cguillermo>	Have you tried installing with the alternate cd?
[15:00	<loder>	LainIwakura http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2008/01/17/adding-additional-repositories/ is about adding repositories generally and the Gutsy one i presume is main - I'm actually using Debian today I I can't actually read it off for you
[15:00	<Sake>	how do I set local mirrors from the command line? I'm using ubuntu server..
[15:00	<spiniker>	im now about to upgrade my laptop to 8.04..
[15:00	<bakom>	hey
[15:00	<Sajuukkhar>	wot alternate cd?
[15:00	<gord_>	indian_munnda:yes thats it sorry
[15:00	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: mmm ok. Now that you say it, I am curious to know what distro do you use!
[15:00	<bazhang>	SeanTater: interesting but not really suited to this channel thanks
[15:00	<amenado>	eimajentha1->	can you paste your /etc/fstab for us to see?
[15:00	<loder>	that was an excessive use of the word actually sorry about that :)
[15:00	<schnootop>	Since installing hardy my gfx card doesnt get recognised and i get default screen resolution. What is the best way to configure this ?
[15:00	<dystopianray>	Jessid: kubuntu
[15:00	<PMantis>	Ubuntu 8.04 JeOS torrent file anyone?
[15:00	<LainIwakura>	loder: Okay thanks.. although another user said that I should not add a gutsy repository line in my hardy sources.list?
[15:00	<tomd123>	Sake: install desktop if you don't know
[15:00	<indian_munnda_>	gord_: ok let me see.
[15:00	<Scunizi>	SeanTater, I think there will be more mirrors available.
[15:00	<bazhang>	!alternate | Sajuukkhar
[15:00	<ubotu>	Sajuukkhar: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
[15:00	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: Ok man! see you! And thanks a lot!
[15:01	<cguillermo>	theres the desktop edition, and an alternate one, that gives you additional options for installing
[15:01	<bakom>	schnootop, I have the same problem
[15:01	<Sajuukkhar>	u mean the i386 one and the other one?
[15:01	<loder>	LainIwakura well as to the wisdom I couldn't say - I'm just a newbie who can search :)
[15:01	<bazhang>	LainIwakura: dont mix repos versions; bad juju will happen ;]
[15:01	<schnootop>	bakom, have you gotten anywhere yet or know why its happening >
[15:01	<LainIwakura>	loder: Hehe, alright.
[15:01	<spiniker>	is there a room for emerald?
[15:01	<LainIwakura>	bazhang: Okay.. :/
[15:01	<cguillermo>	no, there is a desktop and an alternate cd for i386
=== carl is now known as gbosso
[15:01	<bakom>	nope, sorry, schnootop
[15:02	<schnootop>	thats ok, ill update all my packages and see if that will fix it
[15:02	<bazhang>	spiniker: you can try #compiz-fusion
[15:02	<spiniker>	i cant seem to get it running on hardy
[15:02	<spiniker>	ok thnks
[15:02	<Sajuukkhar>	where can i get the alternate cd

[15:03	<Aragorn_Guardian>	nice project
[15:03	<cguillermo>	you shouldnt have to, if your installing from the entire disk the partitions are created automatically.
[15:03	<loder>	Seeya
[15:03	<Aragorn_Guardian>	it works????
[15:04	<Aragorn_Guardian>	is stable?
[15:04	<treut>	flashplugin doesnt work in opera, with ubuntu 8.04
[15:04	<bazhang>	Fatty: sure; just via the net you mean?
[15:04	<Valeria28>	\whois
[15:04	<evand>	Aragorn_Guardian: Mimi: uhm, no, it's not available in Ubuntu Server
[15:04	<Mimi>	Aragorn_Guardian:  You can install any Ubuntu ISO or CD you got using Wubi. Read the Faq
[15:04	<evand>	Aragorn_Guardian: yes, it works.  Yes, it's stable (though see the note about running it on Windows Vista)
[15:04	<bazhang>	loder not so; you are very helpful thanks!
[15:04	<PMantis>	Scunizi: Hmmm, 0 seeders, 0 leechers. Perhaps there's another on google.
[15:04	<Aragorn_Guardian>	nice...gonna read the faq
[15:04	<Fatty>	yea, i mean, i just installed ubuntu 7 like 2 weeks ago and now ubuntu 8 is out so i don't want to burn to cd, just want to like...update, some easy way
[15:04	<bazhang>	haha vista

[15:05	<Aragorn_Guardian>	i hate users.. :/
[15:05	<Fatty>	bazhang, just type dist-upgrade in a terminal?
[15:05	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i did that and it showed the new MAC id.

[15:05	<LainIwakura>	Is it hard to install a font by myself? Since the font I want to install is not in the Hardy repository
[15:05	<bazhang>	fatty you need to make sure 7.10 is completely up-to-date first
[15:05	<Scunizi>	!font | LainIwakura
[15:05	<ubotu>	LainIwakura: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "msttcorefonts" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". No fonts in MPlayer? see !MPlayer
[15:05	<Fatty>	it is
[15:06	<bazhang>	!upgrade | Fatty
[15:06	<ubotu>	Fatty: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[15:06	<Aragorn_Guardian>	Mimi: yeah, but my i got only an old machine by now.. :/....wubi is perfect...seemsvery nice
[15:06	<Myrtti>	LainIwakura: put it in .fonts in your home directory
[15:06	<KiwiJoker>	so whats hardy like so far?
[15:06	<Aragorn_Guardian>	Mimi: an old with a windows....blarg
[15:06	<iddo>	where do i see the last messages of the status log of the upgrade?
[15:06	<gord_>	indian_munnda:ok good, so macchanger has at least worked....let me think a little 2 mins
[15:06	<Aragorn_Guardian>	Mimi: but nice...thanks
[15:06	<bazhang>	KiwiJoker: try it out for yourself
[15:06	<Sajuukkhar>	nope didnt work, one of the ext systems failed
[15:06	<Scunizi>	Myrtti, he still have to rebuild the font cache
[15:06	<indian_munnda>	gord_: ok take your time.
[15:06	<KiwiJoker>	i will, but hows hardy working for others?
[15:06	<PMantis>	Scunizi: Oh, lovely, that took me to poro links when I tried to download
[15:06	<Mimi>	Aragorn_Guardian:   so you basically need  the server in a virtual machine to play around in? I do that too... try Virtual Box if you haven't yet. Works very well on windows
[15:07	<Fatty>	oooh, just got an internal server error trying to go to that webpage
[15:07	<tomd123>	KiwiJoker: Its easy and everything works alot better
[15:07	<bazhang>	KiwiJoker: this is not a chat channel; bit crowded for that thanks
[15:07	<PMantis>	Scunizi: I do appreciate the effort, though. :)
[15:07	<Aragorn_Guardian>	mimi
[15:07	<Aragorn_Guardian>	ops
[15:07	<elektronik123>	who can unlock me on ubuntu-pl ?
[15:07	<Scunizi>	PMantis, wow.. sorry.. I'll let you search ..

[15:08	<usicow>	When I apt-get something, it always goes to us.archive.ubuntu.com. How can I change that?
[15:08	<PMantis>	Scunizi: Heh, NP... google.com/linux was a good pinter
[15:08	<bazhang>	elektronik123: you got banned?

[15:08	<PMantis>	Scunizi: s/pinter/pointer/
[15:08	<elektronik123>	bazhang yes
[15:08	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ok the, the harwdware address of OK, does it have a IP address for that card? I assume eth0?
[15:08	<jburd>	usicow: System >	Administration >	Software Sources
[15:08	<elektronik123>	a lot time ago
[15:08	<bazhang>	usicow: choose another mirror in synaptic
[15:09	<spiniker>	would hardy still run on my old hp pIII machine,256mb ram?
[15:09	<ToxicSoul2>	So I have slight problem, after upgrading my numpad no longer works
[15:09	<bharath>	I installed hardy today; wireless does not work; hp pavilion laptop; Intel(R) 3945ABG/BG chip; iwl3945 driver. I see the chipset being detected in dmesg. But ifconfig does not show this interface. This was working perfectly in gutsy. Installing backports-modules did not help. Please help.
[15:09	<bazhang>	spiniker: gnome hardy? doubtful
[15:09	<jburd>	spiniker: Sure.  Give it a try.  You might want to use xubuntu though.
[15:09	<usicow>	jburd/bazhang: Im only on SSH though.. do you know how I can do it via the console?
[15:09	<cguillermo>	Sajuukkhar, you should reformat your drive first. the easiest way I know to do that without having an os installed is with the alternate cd
[15:09	<amenado>	eimajentha1->	it looks like your /dev/sda1 is mounted to /
[15:09	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i have provided the public IP to the card which was given to me by the ISP.
[15:10	<Fatty>	bazhang, that link doesn't work
[15:10	<elektronik123>	bazhang what can i do ?
[15:10	<cguillermo>	you should try it
[15:10	<Sake>	is there a terminal that's comparable to putty on windows?
[15:10	<Stockfisch>	is anyone here using epiphany instead of firefox ?
[15:10	<jburd>	usicow: You can forward X requests through SSH.   Just ssh in using ssh -X foobar@blah
[15:10	<DJones>	spiniker: xubuntu might be better for a machine with that spec
[15:10	<Ubuntong>	 Does Hardy Heron support compiz on new ATI cards?
[15:10	<eimajentha1>	amenado: yes, but it's commented out, why is that?
[15:10	<sletak>	I've checked the forum but didnt see any recent hits, my new hardy is hanging when syncing to the repository on Translation-en_US.  Seemed to be some hits in google going back to each release.  Anyone else gettign this?
[15:10	<spiniker>	no imean i have 7.10 installed right now..but i think it's slowing down..
[15:10	<jburd>	usicow: Or you'll need to manually edit: /etc/apt/sources.list
[15:10	<Nith>	Sake: there is putty for linux
[15:10	<amenado>	eimajentha1->	it is not commented out, its the line that starts at UUID=xxxx
[15:10	<bazhang>	bharath: the transiton from ipw to iwl has a couple of outstanding bugs at the moment--the launchpad page has a couple of possible workarounds iirc
[15:10	<ddrplayer512>	sletak: I'm getting this problem as well...
[15:10	<jburd>	You don't need putty for linux
[15:10	<treut>	Is anyone manage to get flashplayer working in opera with ubuntu 8.04 x86 ?
[15:10	<rohan>	is there _any_ way to install ubuntu using the iso but without burning the cd? all the cdrw's that i've got are bad :(
[15:10	<sletak>	putty for linux is gtk1
[15:10	<gord_>	indian_munnda:ok, just confirm that you have a dirdcect (network) connection to the internet? u dont use a modem/router/firewall? for example?
[15:10	<bharath>	thanks bazhang; I will look for them
[15:11	<Fatty>	I have the same question as rohan
[15:11	<DJones>	!usb | rohan
[15:11	<ubotu>	rohan: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[15:11	<Nith>	you don't need it, but it does exist
[15:11	<schnootop>	anyone know the best way to rebuild my source.list with the latest sources ?
[15:11	<gord_>	indian_munnda:direct# bad keyboard skills after 24 hours of release-helping haha
[15:11	<amenado>	eimajentha1->	read carefully, the line before it is a comment  #/dev/sda1  but next line starting with UUID is not
[15:11	<ddrplayer512>	The package manager hangs when I try to update simply because, at least I think, a server is down...
[15:11	<Sajuukkhar>	i have reformatted this tho so many times
[15:11	<jburd>	rohan, Fatty: sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 <ISO_PATH>	/mnt/
[15:11	<Nith>	rohan: do you have a second computer (linux)?
[15:11	<bazhang>	fatty okay; change gutsy to hardy in sources.list then sudo apt-get update  followed by sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (and wait for a bit as a ton of packages are downloaede)
[15:11	<sletak>	Sake: what are you trying to accomplish?  Do you need wyse60 emulation or something?
[15:11	<jburd>	rohan: Mount the ISO to a point.
[15:11	<eimajentha1>	amenado: I see!  the UUID identifies the filesystem, and /dev/sda1 is just there for my benefit?
=== sletak is now known as slestak
[15:11	<indian_munnda>	gord_: ;) , yes it is a direct connection to the ISP.
[15:12	<rohan>	jburd: but then what?
[15:12	<spiniker>	can i upgrade using the terminal?
[15:12	<rohan>	Nith: no, second computer is windows only :(
[15:12	<jburd>	rohan: after that run this if you aren't already prompted:
[15:12	<Fatty>	where is sources.list, again?
[15:12	<jburd>	/etc/apt/sources.list
[15:12	<elektronik123>	where are irc ops ?
[15:12	<Fatty>	ah ok
[15:12	<frieze>	so is there a way to use a remote gui tool to set up a firewall on an ubuntu server install without actually installing x windows on the server itself?
[15:12	<bazhang>	spiniker: from gutsy to hardy? sure
[15:12	<amenado>	eimajentha1->	please man fstab  so you can understand what that file is about
[15:12	<termitor>	hello
[15:12	<jburd>	gksudo 'sh /mnt/cdromupgrade'
[15:12	<rohan>	jburd: it's a desktop cd, not a alternate one
[15:12	<eimajentha1>	amenado: never seen it done that way, but apparently it works.  Thanks for your help.
[15:13	<makkbe>	spiniker: yes, do-release-upgrade
[15:13	<bazhang>	elektronik123: go to #ubuntu-ops
[15:13	<jburd>	Oh, I see.  You can't upgrade always using the Desktop CD rohan
[15:13	<spiniker>	yes gutsy to hardy
[15:13	<amenado>	eimajentha1->	please do read  man fstab
[15:13	<unimatrix9>	i guess the new ubuntu is making waves outhere...
[15:13	<nappula>	I can see my wireless card on my iwconfig and the mode is auto even though it should be managed but I can't get the card down to change the mode
[15:13	<jburd>	rohan: You'll need the alternate disc.  It's best to download the live/alternate DVD ISO
[15:13	<eimajentha1>	amenado: Reading
[15:13]  * N3bunel brb pauza de masa
[15:13	<Nith>	frieze: yes, using ssh and +X you can run ayn gui program and the comp you're sshing into doesn't need an X server
[15:13]  * jburd is doing that
[15:13	<Sake>	slestak: I dunno what that means. I just like how putty uses a small font and works with everything. :)
[15:13	<ddrplayer512>	Hello everyone! My package manager freezes when I try to reload the repositories. I had just done a fresh install less than 30 minutes ago. Does anyone else have this problem
[15:13	<Itaku>	my number keys on the right dont work but i have num lock on. how do i fix it
[15:13	<Fatty>	bazhang, you said change gutsy to hardy, how do i do that? do i need to download the iso first?
[15:13	<ddrplayer512>	?
[15:13	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ok then, (some ppl dont realise it might be the modem/router mac they have to change/spoof ) OK, so can you ping anything? try ping 72.14.207.99   its google.com

[15:14	<jones>	greetings all. just upgraded to 8.04 and it is pretty cool. are the repo's running slow for everyone?
[15:14	<amenado>	ddrplayer512->	the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[15:14	<Sajuukkhar>	8 hours until i get this alternate cd
[15:14	<bazhang>	makkbe: sorry; what is the full command? do-release-upgrade in the run command or int the terminal
[15:14	<nibsa1242b>	ddrplayer512: the repos are overwhelmed... give people a few days to upgrade and they'll stop being swamped
[15:14	<unimatrix9>	hardy : when i try to open login screen settings it does not start it, any tips?
[15:14	<snadge>	i have a gutsy install.. and the alternate install for hardy, and the first time i put the disc in.. it asked me if i wanted to upgrade, and then failed (because i couldn't connect to internet).. and now when i put the disc in, it no longer prompts to upgrade.. how do i fix this
[15:14	<amenado>	jones yes, its very very slow
[15:14	<makkbe>	bazhang: in the terminal

[15:14	<Sajuukkhar>	what happens if the alternate cd doesnt work for my partitions?
[15:14	<nibsa1242b>	Sajuukkhar: try a torrent, I got one in less then an hour
[15:14	<jones>	amenado: thanks. just curious.
[15:14	<red_>	i cant install limepro coz gdebi says it connot connect to ubuntu repository while the downloading the last file. my system is up to date with all repo except source code enabled. do i need to add another repo on the list
[15:14	<bazhang>	makkbe: is that preceded by anything? or just that command
[15:14	<amenado>	unimatrix9->	try  ctrl+alt+F1 to F5 to test the log on
[15:14	<rohan>	jburd: anyway, i'd rather clean install than upgrade
[15:14	<asigrist>	are the package servers down right now?
[15:15	<ddrplayer512>	Ah... I imagine that. I've seen that happen when Gutsy came out, too. I should have known... Thanks!
[15:15	<Nith>	rohan: I've got a computer without a working CDROM drive, I use a PXE server to install
[15:15	<snadge>	how do i "force" gutsy to update to hardy using the install cd? (after its already failed once and no longer prompts to upgrade)
[15:15	<ddrplayer512>	I'll try later.
[15:15	<Sajuukkhar>	nibs, i have 25 kb/s internet
[15:15	<Nith>	rohan: its a bit long to set up but it works well
[15:15	<amenado>	asigrist->	->	the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[15:15	<makkbe>	bazhang: no, just that command
[15:15	<unimatrix9>	amendado, i want to set it to auto login, but the manager does not start
[15:15	<jones>	is there a way to remove the firefox 3 beta and use the old firefox? i have a lot of plugins that do not work in 3.. thanks for any help
[15:15	<unimatrix9>	from gnome menu systeem..
[15:15	<frieze>	Nith: thanks. I thought that when I ran ssh -Y it was doing forwarding but my understanding was that all teh gui stuff was happening on the remote machine using my local machine as a display. Since it seems like server and client are used interchangeably in x11 terminology I may have gotten that back-to-front
[15:15	<indian_munnda>	gord_: no i can't ping anything other than my ISP server(the server to which i login before using).
[15:15	<asigrist>	amenado, yea my network connection is quite fast yet i still can't even reload my repositories data.
[15:15	<bazhang>	fatty you want to do this all via the cli?

[15:16	<jones>	makke: do i need to remove the 3 version?
[15:16	<rohan>	Nith: there's no PXE server available for windows? anyway, for that you'd need the alternate disc, right?
[15:16	<Sajuukkhar>	so what happens if the alternate cd doesnt work? do i just give up and go back to dapper drake?
[15:16	<amenado>	unimatrix9->	try  ctrl+alt+F1 to F5 to test the log on  <-- to test it first

[15:16	<jones>	makkbe: do i need to remove 3?
[15:16	<Fatty>	yes, help me, lol
[15:16	<makkbe>	jones: nah, you can have then both installed
[15:16	<spiniker>	well it's taking a little while,but hey,its worth the wait..
[15:16	<gord_>	indian_munnda: aha , i see. and that ping is by IP? not "domain.org" yes?

[15:17	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i can only ping my gateway nothing else.
[15:17	<makkbe>	so you will have to choose for yourself which one to start
[15:17	<jburd>	rohan: Some of us can't do clean installs without going to great lengths
[15:17	<jones>	makkbe: ok i will try it now.
[15:18	<Fatty>	thanks makkbe, i'll let you know if that works

[15:18	<amenado>	rohan->	what do you consider clean install? you can try something like from install from scratch with  debootstrap  but for now only available is 7.10 not 8.04 yet
[15:18	<ddrplayer512>	I really like that new thing where you can use the desktop CD and choose the option to just Install Ubuntu. Has anyone tried that?

[15:19	<makkbe>	artti: no
[15:19	<snadge>	can anyone tell me how to make it so when i insert the alternate install cd to my gutsy install.. it prompts me to upgrade?? its only done it once, and no longer asks me.. there must be some temp files laying around or something?\

[15:19	<bazhang>	rohan ubuntu has one as well

[15:20	<makkbe>	Ubuntong: yes, no worries here
[15:21	<gord_>	indian_munnda: so, to recap you have used macchanger to change a mac, verified it in ifconfig, assigned manual public as given by ISP, and you can ping your default gateway at the ISP. You have a direct network connection (no modem/router involved)? ideas anyone? i susspect this isnt an ubuntu problem, more a "spoof mac to get public IP on a new-box" question, different channel suggestions anyone?
[15:21	<roychri>	I am trying to run the update on my 7.10 but it stuck at "Downloading file 15 of 24". Any suggestions?
[15:21	<jburd>	Does the upgrade tool store all the downloaded packages in /var/cache/apt/archives?

[15:21	<rohan>	bazhang: but will work great, thanks a lot :)
[15:21	<jburd>	That's because I have other machines and I'd like to move new packages to the apt-cacher server
[15:21	<cal_>	sly: a bug specificly for 6910p? or ATI drivers?
[15:21	<vwbusguy->	does Ubuntu 8.04 support ext4?  and if so how can I upgrade my fs from ext3?
[15:21	<dishayu>	i get a (initramfs) screen while trying to install/use live cd of hardy...  c2d e6300,msi p965 neo, 2 GB dd2 667 , Geforce 7300GT 512MB... what do i do?
[15:21	<ddrplayer512>	bazhang: Yeah, I know. But I figured that the repos would be flooded, and I wanted Hardy NOW. So... :)
[15:21	<jburd>	vwbusguy-: Don't unless you're experimenting with the kernel.
[15:22	<qryzy>	my friend has installed it but it wont browse or see other pc on the network
[15:22	<amenado>	vwbusguy-->	you have to compile your kernel to support such new file system
[15:22	<W8TAH>	when doing a dual boot install, one should install windows first, correct???
[15:22	<slytherin>	cal_: some hp laptop enable to boot. not sure of it is same as your problem
[15:22	<indian_munnda>	gord_: when i change my MAC id then i can't even ping my gateway
[15:22	<bakom>	hey, I updated to ubuntu 8.04 and now my screen resolution is somehow strange.. everything is too large, so that I can see only a part of my desktop and now menu to change the resolution, what can I do?
[15:22	<ddrplayer512>	W8TAH: Yes
[15:22	<W8TAH>	thanks
[15:22	<gord_>	indian_munnda: aha! good point then
[15:22	<nibsa1242b>	snadge: is that working for you?
[15:22	<amenado>	qryzy->	you have to be clearer on what the problem is, detail or elaborate your network layout
[15:22	<jburd>	indian_munnda: What is the original problem?
[15:22	<gord_>	indian_munnda: so we just need to restart networking maybe
[15:23	<indian_munnda>	gord_: but i did that too
[15:23	<cal_>	sly: hmm lauchpad is a sourceforge clone?
[15:23	<vwbusguy->	So ext4 is not supported in 8.04?
[15:23	<ddrplayer512>	The rule of thumb is... Older versions of Windows to Newer Versions, then other OSes like Ubuntu/Linux, FreeBSD, etc.
[15:23	<slytherin>	bakom: At the login screen I think you have an option for some recovery.
[15:23	<amenado>	bakom  try  crtl+alt+ +  the last + is the plus in the numeric keypad
[15:23	<nabil2199>	I'm having trouble getting gutsy to upgrade the upgrade manager is unable to download the upgrade tool
[15:23	<slytherin>	cal_: no
[15:23	<indian_munnda>	gord_: let me provide a recap to you.
[15:23	<gord_>	indian_munnda: err, yes, but it didnt work, and it probably should have :)
[15:23	<andycaass>	What was the program that enabled you to see cpu temps on app bar?
[15:23	<bakom>	slytherin, I don't see the login screen when starting up
[15:23	<snadge>	nibsa1242b: cheers that worked thanks :)
[15:23	<rohan>	bazhang: aha, the "usb" factoid helped me.. thanks for the pointer
[15:23	<amenado>	nabil2199->	 ->	->	the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[15:23	<slytherin>	bakom: then how do you login?
[15:23	<Eren>	hi
[15:23	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I can't be bothered to scroll up and read everything.  can you restate your original problem?
[15:23	<un2him>	anyone having problems with gnome-do?
[15:23	<vwbusguy->	amenado, so ext4 is not supported in 8.04?
[15:23	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes please i working 3 probs in 4 channels here lol
[15:23	<nibsa1242b>	nabil2199: the servers are swamped, give them a few hours or days and then try again
[15:23	<nabil2199>	thanks amenado
[15:24	<tomd123>	vwbusguy-: no
[15:24	<spiniker>	nabil u should try it in the terminal.
[15:24	<slytherin>	un2him: what kind of problem?
[15:24	<Eren>	does ubuntu's partition managing application inside installed support ReiserFS?
[15:24	<nibsa1242b>	snadge: you are welcome! happy upgrading
[15:24	<bakom>	slytherin, automatically
[15:24	<spiniker>	i had the same problem
[15:24	<indian_munnda>	jburd: yes i m recaping the problm.
[15:24	<Eren>	does it formats selected partiton with ReiserFS and install ubuntu?
[15:24	<Ubuntong>	Wow the torrent is very fast!
[15:24	<elektronik123>	ubuntu ops don`t recive
[15:24	<andycaass>	What was the program that enabled you to see cpu temps on app bar?
[15:24	<dishayu>	i get a the (initramfs) screen while trying to install/boot from hardy CD...  c2d e6300,msi p965 neo, 2 GB dd2 667 , Geforce 7300GT 512MB... what do i do?
[15:24	<bakom>	amenado, thanks, but nothing happens, when I press crtl+alt+ +
[15:24	<un2him>	slytherin: wont open urls in firefox...does nothing
[15:24	<amenado>	vwbusguy-->	you can verify by checking the /boot/config* file  grep it for ext4 if supported..i already advised you to recompile the kernel
[15:24]  * jburd would like to know where the upgrade tool caches packages
[15:24	<jburd>	So I can move it to my apt-cacher server
[15:24	<bakom>	is there a way to change the screen resolution via console?
[15:25	<amenado>	bakom->	try the crtrl+alt  -   (minus) several times, but be patient, pause between presses
[15:25	<nabil2199>	the upgrade tool(hardy.gz) cannot be downloaded by the update_manager but using wget i got it
[15:25	<gkhnoisgtht>	just a quick question is there anyway to make a live cd ubuntu server that automatically sets up a raid 5 configuration and samba
[15:25	<gord_>	jburd: maybe he just needs if up after macchange...we'll see
[15:25	<slytherin>	bakom: Ok. do one thing. Open terminal from Applications->Accessories. Do 'sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[15:25	<bazhang>	elektronik123: then just go back when they do
[15:25	<adil>	you knowaboutdota
[15:25	<roychri>	amenado: Lots of people upgrading I bet :)
[15:25	<lyroy>	I'm trying to install 8.04 from scratch and I'm having an issue... the installation freeze at Disk Partionner (Scanning disks 46%) ... I have a SATA disk on an Intel Motherboard... does someone have an idea?
[15:25	<slytherin>	bakom: oops, the second file name should be .conf.bak
[15:25	<amenado>	nabil2199->	so you got it use it, i already told you the other end is busy
[15:25	<nabil2199>	thx
[15:26	<nabil2199>	how do I use it?
[15:26	<P0larBear>	busy channel
[15:26	<ad>	hi
[15:26	<slytherin>	un2him: I don't have it installed right now, so will take some time to check
[15:26	<adil>	hi
[15:26	<ad>	are there any stats /web/download from release day ?
[15:26	<un2him>	slytherin: thanks!
[15:26	<P0larBear>	8.04 desktop x86 works great on my gateway laptop....except the screen brightness control keys
=== no7up4u2 is now known as mrbuntuman
[15:26	<roychri>	P0larBear: indeed! Never seen so many people.
[15:26	<bazhang>	ad no idea; not really a support topic thanks
[15:27	<schnootop>	anyone know why the en_AU translations are all broken in the update manager ?
[15:27	<sdakak>	I am downloading the ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i386-iso.torrent from http://www.acc.umu.se/~mighty/ubuntu/. How do i check the md5sum?
[15:27	<P0larBear>	8.04 is a hit i guess :)
[15:27	<bazhang>	!md5 | sdakak
[15:27	<ubotu>	sdakak: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[15:27	<kthakore>	I am having trouble doing the upgrade to hardy in Canada
[15:27	<HayHay>	Hi, Trying to play song on Last FM - Seem to be missing something - won't play. Any suggestions?
[15:27	<hyjal>	Any way to make my NTFS partitions mount automatically in hardy, like they did in gutsy? Now I have to click them to mount them every time I log on
[15:27	<amenado>	kthakore->	 the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[15:27	<nappula>	P0larBear, well I'm considering downgrading already
[15:27	<P0larBear>	HayHay I'm in Toronto and had trouble with the waterlooU server
[15:27	<roychri>	Anyone knows where I could get my hands on Hardy Heron VMWare appliance? I found one when it was still beta and I am looking for the new release.
[15:27	<P0larBear>	it is overloaded
[15:27	<indian_munnda>	i have used the macchanger-gtk to change my MAC, verified it in ifconfig but internet stopped working aftr changing MAC. then assigned my public IP to it as given by the ISP and i can't ping my ISP server through which i login to the server to use internet. I have direct connection.
[15:27	<ad>	bazhang,  is there a normal ubuntu chat channel somewhere , if this is support ?
[15:27	<bazhang>	kthakore: the servers are slow at the moment
[15:28	<sdakak>	bazhang: You miss the point what is md5sum of the proper dvd?
[15:28	<bakom>	amenado, thanks, I tried it, but nothing happens... the problem is also, that I have an laptop keyboard, so I don't have an explicit numpad
[15:28	<bazhang>	!ot | ad
[15:28	<ubotu>	ad: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[15:28	<P0larBear>	i picked a .EU one in the middle of our night, and they were much faster
[15:28	<ad>	P0larBear, ubuntu.com has google analytis enabled
[15:28	<roychri>	The connection has timed out.  The server at archive.ubuntu.com is taking too long to respond.
[15:28	<slytherin>	sdakak: if you are already on ubuntu the command is 'md5sum filename.iso' and then compare it against the one available on website
[15:28	<bakom>	slytherin, I did that (with .bak.conf) ... I'm currently rebooting....
[15:28	<amenado>	bakom then you have to proly fiddle with /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
[15:28	<murlidhar>	still no support for my all in one epson stylus cx2800 :(
[15:28	<bazhang>	sdakak: you want me to search for it?
[15:28	<amenado>	bakom make a copy first though before modifying
[15:28	<slytherin>	roychri: use some local mirror
[15:28	<JohnMM>	sdakak, MD5 (kubuntu-kde4-8.04-alternate-i386.iso) = b7195c72b564b3676e584cb774e9002c
[15:28	<bakom>	amenado, yes, I tried slytherin command
[15:28	<lyroy>	I'm trying to install 8.04 from scratch and I'm having an issue... the installation freeze at Disk Partionner (Scanning disks 46%) ... I have a SATA disk on an Intel Motherboard... does someone have an idea?
[15:28	<slytherin>	amenado: he did that already
[15:29	<indian_munnda>	jburd: i have provided the information to the gord_ read it.
[15:29	<HayHay>	PolarBear: I'm not sure I have the right player or codecs installed?
[15:29	<P0larBear>	anybody have suggestions on if it is possible to get laptop screen brightness control on a Gateway MX6930 laptop?
[15:29	<bazhang>	!codecs | HayHay
[15:29	<ubotu>	HayHay: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[15:29	<sdakak>	slytherin: bazhang: I am looking for the md5sum of the ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i380-iso which is nowhere to be found. It is the DVD
[15:29	<slytherin>	lyroy: it may not be freeze actually, be patient, have a coffee break. If it still doesn't work, file a bug. :-)
[15:29	<P0larBear>	the right codecs to download ubuntu 8.04?
[15:29	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Which ISP is this?  And why are you changing your MAC?
[15:29	<mib_5klyf1zq>	is the server for downloading the respotories naturally slow?
[15:30	<murlidhar>	P0larBear, there is add on paenl thingy than can control the brightness of the moniter
[15:30	<bakom>	slytherin, thanks, It's working :)
[15:30	<amenado>	mib_5klyf1zq->	 the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[15:30	<bazhang>	mib_5klyf1zq: the day after release yes
[15:30	<P0larBear>	murlidhar any idea of the name?
[15:30	<mib_5klyf1zq>	ah i see...
[15:30	<HayHay>	ok - for tip on search for codecs. thx
[15:30	<P0larBear>	it'd be nice to have the keyboard working, but maybe i can get that app to use the keys
[15:30	<gkhnoisgtht>	just a quick question is there anyway to make a live cd ubuntu server that automatically sets up a raid 5 configuration and samba
[15:30	<ampex>	is http://us.archive.ubuntu.com down?
[15:31	<murlidhar>	P0larBear, right-click on the panel and select brightness control
[15:31	<slytherin>	P0larBear: brigheness control won't work if there is problem the way your laptop's ACPI works. Better file a bug
[15:31	<bazhang>	gkhnoisgtht: the server is install only not live
[15:31	<indian_munnda>	jburd: i m having two computer systems when i try to run net in the other one it does not working because MAC is registered to the ISP server.
[15:31	<slytherin>	ampex: that mirror is always known to have problems. I wonder why is it even included in mirror lists
[15:31	<gkhnoisgtht>	could the desktop version be configured as such?
[15:31	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I think it's a bit fast in here.  you can /join ##linux-india I guess.
[15:31	<amenado>	gkhnoisgtht->	i dont think debian-installer preseed support raid 5 yet, but i could be wrong or didnt pay attention to that details as i dont have the need for it
[15:31	<gord_>	indian_munnda: at a commandline please do -   sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart after u ise machanger, let me know if that reports any errors
[15:31	<toxic_>	#ubuntu-fr
[15:31	<mlw1>	is it plausible that installing nvidia 96 drivers would fix my problem with resolution changing?
[15:31	<tristanbob>	does hardy include open office 3, or a beta of it?
[15:31	<bazhang>	gkhnoisgtht: sure; just add lamp
[15:32	<slytherin>	indian_munnda: which ridiculous ISP is that?
[15:32	<gkhnoisgtht>	Thank you both
[15:32	<ampex>	slytherin: have a good replacement for me?
[15:32	<Theo_>	why does it say my ati fire gl is not in use if i enabled it?
[15:32	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes a slower channel will be a lot more help i think, its more of a generla linux - webby-hosting - mac-spoofing question too
[15:32	<tononoinks>	anybody know how to get the mic working
[15:32	<slytherin>	ampex: can't say. I am not in US.
[15:32	<JohnMM>	indian_munnda, comcast does that too ...use a router
[15:32	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I guessed so.  You probably have a static IP address bound to your MAC by your ISP's gateway.
[15:32	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i did the same as you said and it even stopped pinging my ISP srver
[15:32	<ampex>	slytherin: is there a list somewhere?
[15:32	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The best solution is to use a router and tell them to use the hardware address of the router.
[15:32	<Frijolie>	does Hardy have Compiz or Compiz-Fusion installed, how do you check?
[15:33	<edugonch_>	7join #ubuntu-devel
[15:33	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Then connect both computers to the router (using a switch if required)
[15:33	<slytherin>	ampex: you will have to search. There is definitely a list on wiki.ubuntu.com or launchpad.net. Search for word 'mirror'
[15:33	<edugonch_>	7join #ubuntu-dev
[15:33	<roychri>	slytherin: I changed, hit reload, and it complained about some files not found.
[15:33	<JohnMM>	jburd, my router supports mac address spoofing hehe so I just had it spoof the mac address of my computer and all is good :D
[15:33	<bazhang>	gnome does ues Frijolie the basic stuff
[15:33	<tononoinks>	anybody know how to get the mic working?
[15:33	<gord_>	indian_munnda: hmmmmm. did it say anything about DHCP discovers?
[15:33	<indian_munnda>	jburd: yes you r write its a static ip
[15:33	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The other solution is to set up the already configured machine as a proxy for the other machine.
[15:33	<Frijolie>	bazhang: huh?
[15:33	<slytherin>	roychri: which files?
[15:33	<mib_5klyf1zq>	whats the best video editor for linux? or is it better to just use virtualbox and install adobe premiere on windows?
[15:33	<jburd>	indian_munnda: bridge both network interfaces one to wan and the other to lan
[15:34	<roychri>	PAckages.gz
[15:34	<roychri>	slytherin: Packages.gz
[15:34	<jburd>	indian_munnda: MAC spoofing isn't a very ideal solution.
[15:34	<slytherin>	mib_5klyf1zq: you may want to try kino or pitivi
[15:34	<mib_5klyf1zq>	wat about cinelerra?
[15:34	<jburd>	indian_munnda: a switch will cost you somewhere around 900 bucks INR.
[15:34	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yeah far simpler if other machine is still working
[15:34	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i m running DNS server
[15:34	<cvw>	I cannot perform updates against http://us.archive.ubuntu.com, however, I can ping it just fine.  Is this a known issue?
[15:34	<tolonuga>	anyone speeking french here? I got a bug report (221856 at launchpad.net), but because of the french locale I don't understand it. if anyone could translate it for me, that would be nice.
[15:34	<mrTr0ut>	okay, so I just installed 8.04 to a ext3 partition but it never modified the boot record and I only have the option to boot into xp
[15:34	<bazhang>	cvw: the servers are overloaded at the moment
[15:34	<Pilha>	hello ev'ryone
[15:35	<roychri>	cvw: Too many people upgrading. Use a local server/mirror
[15:35	<indian_munnda>	jburd: you mean to use a hub
[15:35	<Heroin>	anyone here use or used conceal?
[15:35	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ah yes u did say, i no expert on that , but it might comlicate
[15:35	<amenado>	mrTr0ut->	then what are you waiting for? modify it to suit your new install
[15:35	<jburd>	indian_munnda: No.  I mean use a switch.   Not a hub.
[15:35	<Pilha>	ahaa, before even asking I have my answer
=== P0larBear is now known as PolarB3ar
[15:35	<cvw>	roychri: your comment is unhelpful without a link to a list that can provide local servers or mirrors.
[15:35	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The best solution is to use a router with your ISP.
[15:35	<HayHay>	P0larBear: What player comes up when you select a song to listen to?
[15:35	<roychri>	cvw: The list is in synaptic.
[15:35	<mlw1>	did anything change with the connect to server interfaces?  They're not working for me anymore
[15:35	<noob-africa>	hi all
[15:36	<Pilha>	so, does anyone have a mirrors or local servers list?
[15:36	<roychri>	cvw: In "Repositeries"
[15:36	<HayHay>	P0larBear: At LastFM?
[15:36	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Where are you located and which ISP is this?
[15:36	<Heroin>	Anyone use Conceal?
[15:36	<bazhang>	cvw: use synaptic to change mirrors and go easy on the volunteers here thanks
[15:36	<indian_munnda>	jburd: but ISP is not providing any router.

[15:42	<dmakalsky>	gord_, yes
[15:42	<dmakalsky>	I did run from the cmd line

[15:47	<gord_>	<dmakalsky: md5sum /path/to/the/iso/file/filename.iso, then check it agains the md5 for that file, by looking at the md5s, i'll try to plingbot it now vvvvvvvvvv

[15:48	<Pilha>	ok ppl, many thx for the help - worst case is I wait for the servers to lighten up :)
[15:48	<shadow_>	thats mainly because i don't know what im doing most of the time :)

[15:48	<bazhang>	shadow_: get ubuntu and then come back--we forgive your momentary straying from reason

[15:51	<kernando>	histo im sure there are  i was just wondering if anyone knew one that resembles Mirc 6.31 for windows

[15:51	<slytherin>	kernando: you can use pidgin, but not sure if it is close to mirc
[15:51	<histo>	tawt: basically / is for the system and software but all your saved data will reside in /home

[15:51	<tawt>	i know that / is the main files, and /home is my personal stuff
[15:51	<IndyGunFreak>	shadow_: i don't know, the instructions on adobe's site are pretty clear,
[15:51	<ere4si>	kernando: try xchat
[15:51	<clemyeats>	shadow_: maybe you could install these packages and then run envy again.
[15:51	<bazhang>	tawt depends on you maybe /10 and /home 12 and the rest for boot and swap
[15:51	<kernando>	heh thats what im using

[15:52	<gord_>	dmakalsky: other than a MD5 error, maybe it wont work in a loop-mounted system due to needing "itself" during upgrade u see

[15:57	<IndyGunFreak>	clemyeats: well polls said John kerry was gonna cream george bush
[15:57	<koudelka>	bazhang, i'm asking because it's not there...
[15:57	<elfer>	fdgdfgdfgdf
[15:57	<bazhang>	koudelka: not sure if the hardy are there but that will be the place when they are
[15:57	<clemyeats>	ah well..
[15:57	<amenado>	RoiG->	  the server side is extremely busy, you may have the perception it is unresponsive and not working..
[15:57	<koudelka>	bazhang,  you know anything when it will be out? i know there was some for the beta
[15:57	<Turms_gutsy>	slytherin: why do you agree for a separate /boot partition, what is it for?
[15:57	<slytherin>	gnychis: probably waiting for mirror to respond. You can try command do-release-upgrade from terminal
[15:58	<Koheleth>	is there a short cut to bring yp a cursor that kills a program like in kde?
[15:58	<afallenhope>	I'm having a hard time finding LAMP or Apache for that matter
[15:58	<bazhang>	koudelka: is this from another system? you might try unetbootin
[15:58	<Turms_gutsy>	slytherin: it was only needed many years ago for the 1024th cylinder problem
[15:58	<nibsa1242b>	slytherin: I don't think its an absolute necessity, however, it doesn't hurt. My log file filling up actually happened on a laptop. There was a bug with the card reader and it logged about 1GB of error per hour.
[15:58	<slytherin>	Turms_gutsy: check the reason specified by nibsa1242b just above my comment
[15:58	<rconan>	so... I've asked this a few times already and not found anyone yet. Anyone installed hardy onto a FakeRAID? I had a few problems trying to before
[15:58	<bazhang>	Koheleth: xkill
[15:58	<El1>	Is it normal that, altho I have never upgraded from beta to final version of hardy heron, I am already running the final version according to alternative CD?
[15:58	<Koheleth>	ok
[15:58	<RoiG>	amenado ->	it's not the server i downloaded the CD version, but when it is calculating the changes, it says an error (sorry for my poor english).
[15:58	<RodGo>	anybody here uses amsn? because ive just intalled ubuntu hardy and amsn 0.97 and managed to get it working
[15:59	<gnychis>	slytherin: that hangs at "Checking for a new ubuntu release 0%" ... maybe i should try to switch mirrors?
[15:59	<bazhang>	El1: you updated all the way? then yes you will be on final
[15:59	<RodGo>	the problem is that when i try to change my display pic, the program closes my ubuntu session and i get my login screen again :S
[15:59	<mindframe->	dystopianray, https://beans.mindframe.org/
[15:59	<koudelka>	bazhang, nah, i just like to have a minicd laying around whenever i need to do a reinstall
[15:59	<Turms_gutsy>	slytherin: well, it is 10 years i use linux, and never had the need to have /boot in a separate partition
[15:59	<nibsa1242b>	El1: normally the beta or RC automatically updates to final after release
[15:59	<slytherin>	gnychis: that is what I would suggest
[15:59	<RodGo>	and have no clue on how to fix this issue
[15:59	<El1>	Ok, thanks for the info
[15:59	<ideal_loco>	strftime
[15:59	<RodGo>	anybody is going trough the same?
[15:59	<Koheleth>	bazhang: thanks
[15:59	<dystopianray>	mindframe-: it's password protected
[15:59	<toresn>	do any on you use 'music on console (moc)'?
[15:59	<bazhang>	koudelka: should turn up in a few days; will keep an eye pealed for you
[15:59	<darren_>	hi i am having a problem vewing video's on the net is their any plugins i need to fix the problem
[15:59	<mosno>	Turms_gutsy: try running full-disk encryption LUKS/LVM --- /boot comes in handy in this instance :)
[16:00	<mindframe->	dystopianray, oh i thought it might offer the cert before that
[16:00	<dystopianray>	mindframe-: nevermind i see the error now
[16:00	<nibsa1242b>	Turms_gutsy: slytherin then you are lucky Turms; I always put it in a separate partition
[16:00	<red_>	wow, installing dependencies for limewire pro eats up all cores of my core 2 duo e4600 cpu...
[16:00	<tawt>	ok, so i just made a new partition for my /home.  it's asking for the location of the partition, either "Beginning" or "End."  Which is a better choice?
[16:00	<El1>	darren_: your firefox just crashes when you are trying to vieuw a flash video?
[16:00	<ushaba>	upgrading to hardy basically hosed my system: can't get x working, kernel panic for the new kernel, can only boot into safe mode under an older kernel and can't get wireless working from the commandline; anyone able to help?
[16:00	<darren_>	ya
[16:00	<mem_oro_76>	gparted question: what does a "Can't have overlapping partitions" error mean?
[16:00	<El1>	darren_: try killall pulseaudio in terminal, see if that helps
[16:00	<amenado>	ushaba->	install the older 7.10 and be happy for now..
[16:01	<nibsa1242b>	ushaba: if you had a separate /home you can just do a clean install and be done with it
[16:01	<gord_>	df -H
[16:01	<bazhang>	mem_oro_76: exactly what it says
[16:01	<mindframe->	dystopianray, ive been searching through about:config to see if theres something that causes this.  no luck yet.
[16:01	<sipior>	mem_oro_76: just what it says. partitions can't overlap each other on disk. check the end and beginning cylinder numbers
[16:01	<tawt>	ok, so i just made a new partition for my /home.  it's asking for the location of the partition, either "Beginning" or "End."  Which is a better choice?
[16:01	<gord_>	<needs coffee and a lie down if making mistakes like that
[16:01	<OllieA>	How do I finmd
[16:01	<amenado>	tawt->	beginning
[16:01	<tawt>	thanks
[16:01	<bazhang>	gord_: haha
[16:01]  * slytherin time to leave
[16:01	<ov1d1u_nitan>	where I can find an IRC client for GTK? (but not X-Chat)
[16:02	<OllieA>	How do I find out what my graphcs card is in Hardy?
[16:02	<ov1d1u_nitan>	with the Mirc look-n-feel
[16:02	<fysa>	I am stuck on 'Prepare partitions' with all options ghosted out and no partitions listed.  It seems no drives are detected.
[16:02	<lynxie>	cool, ubuntu 8.04 lts under vmware :)
[16:02	<tawt>	olliea   lspci in terminal
[16:02	<darren_>	nothn was runnin under pulseaudio
[16:02	<OllieA>	tawt: Cheers
[16:02	<bazhang>	mirc via wine if you must ov1d1u_nitan
[16:02	<amenado>	OllieA->	it should be the same as in gutsy? lest you changed your hardware
[16:02	<Turms_gutsy>	mosno: ok, i never had the need to use luks, so you may be right, but for a normal user (as the 99% are) there is no need to have /boot in a separate partition
[16:02	<andycr>	ov1d1u_nitan: Pidgin works with IRC
[16:02	<RodGo>	hey anybody here uses amsn 0.97 with ubuntu hardy?
[16:02	<ov1d1u_nitan>	ok, thanks andycr
[16:02	<askand>	No more bugs are being fixed in hardy unless they are security- or critical bugs? True or false?
=== _Lucretia__ is now known as _Lucretia_
[16:03	<nibsa1242b>	OllieA: lspci | grep [ati, nvidia, intel, etc] or just lspci if the manufacturer name doesn't show up
[16:03	<red_>	wow, installing dependencies for limewire pro eats up all cores of my core 2 duo e4600 cpu..and my system is not sending packets to the net. is this a bug?
[16:03	<CaptainMorgan>	I see a bug wasn't fixed in Hardy- I have a top panel that is set to not expand, top and hide upon hitting a button... upon a system restart, from 7.04 to now 8.04 that panel when started is directly above the bottom panel- to get it back into position, the same sequence of steps need to be followed EVERY time. Right Click panel >	Check Expand >	Select Top >	Check Expand again(so that it now doesn't expand) any ideas why this
[16:03	<CaptainMorgan>	 wasn't fixed ?
[16:03	<Kcaj>	Hey guys!
[16:03	<Kcaj>	Ubuntu is going SO GREAT!
[16:03	<bazhang>	askand: this is not the channel to ask in
[16:03	<El1>	darren_: just try killall pulseaudio and see if firefox still crashes when you're trying to view a video
[16:03	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: is that the same as sectors? cause I got a tiny partition that refuses to die
[16:03	<mosno>	Turms_gutsy: /boot is also handy if you decide to get rid of Ubuntu but you want your bootloader to not break (you just leave /boot alone)
[16:03	<Kcaj>	Is there a good IRC Daemon for Ubuntu I can get with SYnaptics?
[16:03	<Kcaj>	Especially if it is easy to set up
[16:03	<askand>	﻿ bazhang: why not?
[16:03	<darren_>	their was no processes killed whin i did that though
[16:03	<amenado>	CaptainMorgan->	low on priority list?
[16:03	<cemc>	hi
[16:03	<RoiG>	i dont know what i have to do, help me please, when i try to update it pops this error: An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.
[16:03	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: maybe that's what's causing the error
[16:03	<mosno>	Turms_gutsy: apart from that i don't think i've had a real need for a separate /boot
[16:03	<CaptainMorgan>	amenado, it's quite annoying...
[16:03	<bazhang>	because we are not the bug triagers askand
[16:04	<cemc>	what's the best way to increase bash history file limit globally?
[16:04	<CaptainMorgan>	amenado, maybe it's not even on the list ?
[16:04	<tech0007>	when is ibex coming out?
[16:04	<askand>	﻿bazhang: I see, ubuntu-bugs?
[16:04	<amenado>	CaptainMorgan->	well you can access the source code and try to fix it yourself?
[16:04	<Turms_gutsy>	mosno: i agree with you :-D
[16:04	<bazhang>	!bug | askand
[16:04	<ubotu>	askand: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug report at: http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu  -  Bugs in/wishes for the bots can be filed at http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-bots
[16:04	<sipior>	mem_oro_76: might be, but a bit odd that you can't destroy the partition. does it have a special type?
[16:04	<amenado>	CaptainMorgan->	or wait til someone have time to work on it
[16:04	<leprasmurf>	so how many reports have there been of nvidia drivers screwing up now?
[16:04	<OllieA>	How do I install a graphics card driver?
[16:04	<vbabiy-laptop>	hey guys has any one noticed that the sound is can become choppy when you are using firefox.
[16:04	<gnychis>	whenever I try to hit "upgrade" to upgrade to 8.04 LTS in the Update Manager, the update manager freezes, how else can I do a full dist upgrade? i tried do-release-upgrade and it freezes at "Checking for a new ubuntu release 0% [Working]"  .... i tried switching mirrors too, no luck
[16:05	<andycr>	Are the apt servers for gutsy completely smashed for anyone else? I can't get any packages.
[16:05	<nibsa1242b>	OllieA: what card do you have?
[16:05	<nlindblad>	OllieA: What card?
[16:05	<nlindblad>	OllieA: ATi or Nvidia?
[16:05	<OllieA>	nlindblad: 2 secs
[16:05	<mindframe->	andycr, yeah im sure theyre quite busy
[16:05	<bazhang>	andycr: that is the #1 question today
[16:05	<nlindblad>	OllieA: Know how to check?
[16:05	<sipior>	andycr: try another mirror...
[16:05	<darren_>	ok the video is playing verry choppy
[16:05	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: the servers are swamped... if you let it sit there for an hour or so it'll probably unfreeze
[16:05	<nlindblad>	OllieA: Try lspci and see if the kernel recognises it
[16:05	<amenado>	gnychis->	   the server side is extremely busy, you may have the perception it is unresponsive and not working..
[16:05	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: it says filesystem unknown - it was formatted as hfs+ before but all I want to do is wipe it completely so I can make a new partition
[16:05	<andycr>	sipior: A mirror for apt? I'm not sure how I would add a mirror to sources.list.
[16:05	<ushaba>	i'm debating a clean install
[16:06	<ushaba>	but the cd burner on the other laptop is dead
[16:06	<ushaba>	haha
[16:06	<sagredo>	hi, can someone point me to 8.04 sources.list
[16:06	<gnychis>	amenado: nibsa1242b: i see... is it possible to upgrade via bittorrent?
[16:06	<gribouille>	does ubuntu support itanium ?
[16:06	<amenado>	ushaba dont include us in your debate,
[16:06	<ushaba>	i'll do some research on getting wireless working from the commandline first
[16:06	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: Linux can't read hfs+ fully, but without the journal it should work
[16:06	<ushaba>	back in a bit
[16:06	<darren_>	and i can't do anything at all with firefox
[16:06	<RoiG>	When i try to update from 7.10 to 8.04 i get this error "An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.. "
[16:06	<koro>	i have a fat32 drive added to my fstab so that it is automounted, and i have a link to a folder in it in my gnome desktop, but always the first time i click on that folder it takes a few seconds to open up the folder, anyone knows why this happens?
[16:06	<darren_>	while playing video
[16:06	<RoiG>	solutions?
[16:06	<daemon3>	Looks to me like the servers are still overloaded.
[16:06	<bazhang>	!slow | RoiG
[16:06	<ubotu>	RoiG: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of the latest edition. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[16:06	<OllieA>	nlindblad: PMed you
[16:06	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: If you just want to format it with another filesystem that is easy
[16:07	<Turms_gutsy>	mosno: as for the bootloader, well, it is not a problem, i have a floppy disk for it, to be frank in 10 yrs i did not see the need to have /boot in a separate partition, i have /home/myuser/documents in a separate partition so i can share it with different distro's
[16:07	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: you could torrent the alt install CD (or the desktop / alt install DVD) however, I was told if you go that route packages that aren't on the cd/dvd could break during upgrade
[16:07	<daemon3>	Are the servers usually overloaded for Ubuntu?
[16:07	<techqbert>	I have 51 packages held back up apt-get upgrade, no worries?
[16:07	<Kcaj>	Is there a good IRC Daemon for Ubuntu I can get with SYnaptics?
[16:07	<techqbert>	daemon3: No.
[16:07	<mem_oro_76>	nlindblad: i know but I don't even want it to, I want a clean slate so I can format ext3 and fat32 but, this tiny partition won't go away
[16:07	<gribouille>	does ubuntu support itanium ?
[16:07	<sipior>	andycr: just edit the sources.list to point at another mirror. i think there's also a command-line program to do this, though the name currently escapes me.
[16:07	<leprasmurf>	hello all, I've attempted to upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04, my nvidia drivers crapped out on me.  I had to revert to the legacy drivers.  is there some new proceedure that I don't know about?
[16:07	<bazhang>	on the day after release yes daemon3
[16:07	<techqbert>	daemon3: 8.04 just launched.
[16:07	<Kcaj>	The Ubuntu servers were VERY FAST until abut Noon (EST) Yesterday... lol
[16:07	<daemon3>	techqbert: I know.
[16:07	<tech0007>	i upgraded from gutsy to hardy and i still have the old /etc/fstab. does hardy still use fstab?
[16:07	<elektronik123>	who had a WC in Pc
[16:08	<elektronik123>	?
[16:08	<darren_>	whell gata go to work be back in about 8 hours
[16:08	<amenado>	Kcaj->	blame it on me, i was downloading..hehe
[16:08	<RoiG>	i get this error when im trying to upgrade from the CD not the servers..
[16:08	<rwycuff>	Kcaj: there should be some just search the ubuntu community docs for them and how to install
[16:08	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: I will tell you that after the system updated sat for about 20min looking like it was dead, it started functioning properly for me, and with my local mirror it looks like I'll be done downloading everything I need with a total time of under two hours
[16:08	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: What kind of device is it?
[16:08	<k[5\5]>	804 started
[16:08	<ov1d1u_nitan>	when I try to install nextaw, apt-get says:
[16:08	<ov1d1u_nitan>	﻿Package nextaw is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[16:08	<ov1d1u_nitan>	This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[16:08	<ov1d1u_nitan>	is only available from another source
[16:08	<bazhang>	RoiG: the cd? you mean the alternate cd--they use the mirrors too
[16:08	<FloodBot2>	ov1d1u_nitan: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[16:08	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: Wiping it clean would mean to completely overwrite the partition table
[16:08	<ov1d1u_nitan>	what can I do?
[16:08	<mem_oro_76>	nlindblad: and the rest of the free space won't partition as anything cuse of this overlapping partitions error
[16:08	<Kcaj>	rwycuff: I'm looking for one that I can get through Synaptics, I'l tell you how it goes
[16:09	<mem_oro_76>	it's a USB harddrive
[16:09	<Calin24>	I'm trying to upgrade from gutsy to heron, but synaptic locks up every time i click on update.... any suggestions?
[16:09	<amenado>	RoiG->	how do you know its getting the update from the CD and not remotely? how did you verify this?
[16:09	<bazhang>	!paste | ov1d1u_nitan
[16:09	<ubotu>	ov1d1u_nitan: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[16:09	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: cat /dev/zero >	/dev/device would overwrite everything
[16:09	<kernando>	in ubuntu cant i have  a lan connection and my wireless connection running at the same time?
[16:09	<lirit>	where is the trash folder?
[16:09	<CaptainMorgan>	amenado, thankfully it looks like someone has noticed it: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-panel/+bug/217514
[16:09	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: fdisk could then re-create the partition table and let you make differently sized partitions
[16:09	<dystopianray>	kernando: yes you can, but i don't think network-manager supports it
[16:09	<bazhang>	kernando: not practically
[16:09	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: Which you could then put filesystems on
[16:09	<CaptainMorgan>	it's reversed in my situation- I'm surprised nobody noticed it earlier... that bug report is for this month
[16:09	<Nith>	is there a way to md5sum a directory recursively?
[16:09	<kernando>	hmmmmm
[16:09	<amenado>	CaptainMorgan->	alright..keep the person on the other end happy, send em cookies and pizza..hehe
[16:09	<RoiG>	amenado ->	because when updating from the CD you can select if install the updated packets from internet or use the ones from CD?
[16:10	<CaptainMorgan>	 and it's not a Hardy-specific bug
[16:10	<b1n0ry>	how do i know that i'm on LTS and not RC?
[16:10	<mem_oro_76>	nlindblad: OK, thanks for pointing me in the right
[16:10	<k[5\5]>	<Calin24>,chang your source ,replace gusty to hardy
[16:10	<ToxicSoul2>	Hey does anyone have any idea why my number keypad would stop working after upgrading? Keyboard - sun type 6
[16:10	<vbabiy-laptop>	hey guys has any one noticed that the sound is can become choppy when you are using firefox.
[16:10	<nibsa1242b>	Calin24: the servers are swamped; first make sure you are using a mirror; then just allow the Update manager to sit there for a long time (20-60min)and it'll probably start working
[16:10	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: No problem
[16:10	<ov1d1u_nitan>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64374/
[16:10]  * delcoyote hi
[16:10	<kernando>	because i just want to be able to ftp through to my other pc sometimes without having to disable my internet
[16:10	<ov1d1u_nitan>	here are the output
[16:10	<amenado>	RoiG->	how do you verify this? did you look at the scripts on what it does?
[16:10	<lirit>	where is the trash folder in the file system?
[16:10	<mem_oro_76>	nlindblad: cat /dev/zero?? what does that do?
[16:10	<ov1d1u_nitan>	what can I do?
[16:10	<rwycuff>	Kcaj: im not sure if Unrealircd is in ther ebut its more commong
[16:10	<mlw1>	how is this release an improvement?  Everything that was working for me is broken.  I get more error messages than windows, I can't drag icons without it freezing, and I can't even quit without it freezing what's up with this...
[16:10	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: It's a constant stream of zeroes (0000)
[16:10	<Calin24>	alright.. thanks

[16:11	<RoiG>	amenado ->	i unplugged my wired ethernet connection and its the same. its not the servers its a problem with something of the update.
[16:11	<amenado>	RoiG->	and if it finds the ones on the cd is older ..do you know if it attempts to retrieve from the archive?

[16:11	<nibsa1242b>	Calin24: thats what I'm doing and it seems to be working... they key point is to use a local mirror and not the "main server"
[16:11	<lirit>	tech0007: thanks

[16:12	<amenado>	RoiG->	i asked you, did you have a chance to look at the scripts in how it upgrades? maybe it does look to the net too if it cant resolve ?

[16:23	<CyberCod>	and it came up asking me to select timezone (which sucks more than ever now btw) and then tried to start partitioner and crashed
[16:23	<Flannel>	niteye: the DVD is the LiveCD + Alternate CD + More packages on the disc
[16:23	<andycr>	connor_: Try clicking "Custom" in the list and typing vlc in the box
[16:23	<nikitis>	ere4si, also why on Ubuntuguide.org, it's one of the only things on there, teaching people how to correct it.

[16:25	<andycr>	ubuntung-pinoy: Yeah, they're pretty hammered at the moment
[16:25	<nikitis>	ere4si, the install isn't autosetting the boot flag for the /boot partitions
[16:25	<connor_>	andycr: i cant find a custom option this is 8.04 right
[16:25	<needcdrom>	bazhang: ubuntung-pinoy: it's because everyone is trying to connect to the servers and they are slow
[16:25	<manawenuz>	please someone help me , i can't connect to a PPTP vpn server which i've installed ,  can anyone help me to figure out why ??? , btw i can connect to it with windows .
[16:25	<Dr_willis>	Bert_2,  You could try some of the monitor/screen contorl tools to disable the 2nd monitor. or make a different xorg.conf to only enable one monitor.
[16:25	<Halsafar>	Anyone lend any advice for getting the Hyper-V Integration Components for Linux installed in hardy ?
[16:25	<helloworld>	iusegnulinux: thnks
[16:25	<andycr>	connor_: Not sure then, sorry. I'm running 7.10; perhaps it's different.
[16:25	<Flannel>	nikitis: the boot flag is useless for all modern OSes, not even windows uses it.
[16:25	<CyberCod>	evand: the timezone thing sucks... thats my issue with it.  It is hard to control and doesn't have any means of just selecting my actual time zones without needing to know geography
[16:25	<ov1d1u_nitan>	somebody can help me with this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64379/
[16:25	<CaptainMorgan>	why did ubuntu ship with a beta version of firefox ?
[16:25	<Bert_2>	Dr_willis: yeah but I find it rather stupid to restart X just for playing a game
[16:25	<mariocesar_bo>	hey bashang, i get this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64381/
[16:25	<bazhang>	needcdrom: that will be the case with the alternate too; where do you think the newest are checked against but the mirrors?
[16:25	<mariocesar_bo>	for my chipset

[16:26	<manawenuz>	please someone help me , i can't connect to a PPTP vpn server which i've installed ,  can anyone help me to figure out why ??? , btw i can connect to it with windows .
[16:26	<ere4si>	nikitis: you can set / as bootable in the install - might be h/ware related
[16:26	<iusegnulinux>	﻿Flannel: "not even windows" ???
[16:26	<Dr_willis>	Bert_2,  try the config tools to change it on the fly.. or  restartx,, or do without the game i guess.
[16:26	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycr: needcdrom, oh so that's why.. are updates available through torrent?:-/
[16:26	<nikitis>	Flannel, turns out, that was my issue.  I set /boot with a boot flag and it worked
[16:26	<andycr>	connor_: On mine, I go into Removeable Drives and Media, click Multimedia, and under "Video DVD Discs" I can put vlc in command
[16:26	<MrDakoki>	how i can get the path of a library in ubuntu?
[16:26	<CyberCod>	it zooms every time I hover over it, and usually starts off somewhere in africa or austrailia
[16:26	<mphill>	asfalt: look at apt-cacher
[16:26	<m3ltd0wn123>	I am having an issue setting up proftpd, it starts, but when i try to connect it says "connection lost"

[16:34	<DBautell>	JDogHerman, Ubuntu picks a random root password and does not share it with you. Best practice is to use sudo.

[16:35	<clemyeats>	JDogHerman: if you can't login, with the liveCD. If you can with sudo passwd root

[16:46	<O||y>	Hi all
[16:46	<CyberCod>	it sucks because it attempts to make something easier and just ends up making a mess of the whole process.... selecting your time zone should be a simple drop down box.  And if you MUST include a zoomable map, put a dropdown box for timezone next to it... or highlight a vertical stripe of the map with which timezone is currently selected so that you can tell if your city happens to fall within it.

I reformated my ubuntu feisty install to a hardy one today and on reboot i couldn't boot into either OS because grub had the wrong menu items in it.

[17:23	<icqnumber>	!password
[17:23	<ubotu>	Forgot your password? Boot into recovery mode. What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password?

[17:23	<Mimi>	Mapp:  we can get a better one working for you so go to sofware sources,.... then on that window look on the center,  click where it says Download From... then "Other" then "select the best server" let it do its thing, then click Choose server, close, and youre good to go :)

I'm not sure how to do this though, can anyone tell me how/where to configure this line to run on boot?

[17:35	<grimboy>	I've switched from gnome to wmii and my external harddrive (which was handled by gnome-volume-manager before) is no longer mounted. I'm not sure if gnome-volume-manager is still running or not. I'm still running gdm. Anyone have any idea how I get automatic mounting back?
[17:35	<tacone>	pjoul: I did.
[17:35	<rjonesx>	the only problem on reboot is an error about the wireless device (this is an x64 laptop)
[17:35	<amenado>	manawenuz->	well we need to find out where is it going to be connected to?
[17:35	<pjoul>	tacone: so why you ask?
[17:35	<Cherryade>	Hm, okay, I'll ask again. How do you disable the stupid Music Player when you inserrt a disc on Hardy Heron? It used to be in System/Preferences/Removable Drives and Media, but it's not there anymore. It's the most annoying "feature" ever that's about to cause me to install a different distro.
[17:35	<Mr_Freshy>	after upgrading to 8.04, my graphics are "weird" -- title bars turn transparent and glitchy
[17:35	<Halsafar>	Ikonia: Yeah I believe so as well, and I am not running it.  Can I install it and switch to it? 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-xen-desktop'
[17:35	<Raits>	kakado: you mean insert those lines into the menu.lst?
[17:35	<danbhfive>	Invisionfree: you could try dist-upgrade or install ubuntu-desktop^
[17:35	<jratzo>	so hows everyone liking hardy?
[17:35	<tacone>	pjoul: I don't have that optimizations even after upgrading.
[17:35	<twinkie_addict>	i ike it alot so far
[17:35	<aldin>	bazhang: ok, thanks
[17:35	<ikonia>	Halsafar: it's not xen desktop, xen is a kernel package (+tools)
[17:35	<pjoul>	Cherryade: nautilus ->	preferences
[17:35	<tacone>	pjoul: I am wondering why and if it's normal
[17:35	<manawenuz>	amenado: do you want another drawing ?

[17:36	<icqnumber>	ikonia, one more time there are not error messages, or warning, btw. only one with CUPS, but i have no printer connected
[17:36	<Mapp>	 when i tried to install my updates it said it couldn't download all the respiratory indexes?

[17:36	<Invisionfree>	Here's what dist-upgrade said:

[17:36	<FloodBot2>	Invisionfree: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[17:36	<kakado>	Raits: yes, or try it manually in grub, by editing the menu
[17:36	<amenado>	manawenuz->	you wanted assistance? you have to do your part.
[17:36	<Cherryade>	Wait, it's in Nautilus? Whoever designed that needs to be shot
[17:36	<Cherryade>	How completely non-obvious
[17:36	<manawenuz>	amenado: ok i'll
[17:36	<Halsafar>	Ikonia: I am having trouble finding it with apt-get, I do have all the repo's uncommented and did and update.
[17:36	<Odd-rationale>	OK. I have the desktop CD. It was wubi on it. Does wubi require that it has the iso locally on the hdd? And does it download an iso again?
[17:36	<AaronMT>	!wubi
[17:36	<ubotu>	wubi is Wubi advice here: http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=234  and  http://wubi-installer.org  [file wubi bugs here:  https://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug ] (it is included in hardy 8.04 beta CD and will be in the final release)

[17:37	<rjonesx>	is there something that launches every time you try to open a new program that isnt opened when you launch the tracker search tool?

But sometimes it crashes and i have to restart browser to get it working again. While i was testing Fedora i had similar crashes but i could fix them by reloading page.
[17:37	<El1>	Nobody here an expert in nvidia drivers then?
[17:37	<Halsafar>	Ikonia: heh they are there, I was just failing.  I will install the xen-hypervisor kernels and see what happens.  Thanks for your help./
[17:37	<kakado>	Raits: I tried some different combinations and then it worked :)
[17:37	<ikonia>	icqnumber: one moment, just let me work it through in my head
[17:37	<Cherryade>	Thanks for the help though

[17:39	<Callipyginous>	I am unable to add a new entry in visudo, any ideas?
[17:39	<dbristow>	that tears it, that proves that the MD5SUMS line is bogus
[17:39	<pjoul>	tacone: this could be the issue
[17:39	<tacone>	pjoul: I am wondering if there's any way to reset to hardy defaults.
[17:39	<Pokit>	amenado i'm just trying to boot xp. I ran the update manager and it messed up my boot menu
[17:39	<kakado>	Raits: heh, I'm not sure
[17:39	<dbristow>	who do I ask to get this fixed?
[17:39	<mirdin76>	is the hardy heron upgrade recommended for non expert users at this point?
[17:39	<tacone>	pjoul: I can apply those things one by one, but I simply don't know all of them.
[17:39	<jharkn>	﻿Pokit: you probably want to change the second number

[17:40	<tacone>	pjoul: Thanks anyway
[17:40	<ikonia>	icqnumber: there have been bugs that I've seen in hardy to do with "sudo", and how hardy deals with authentication. It appears to use the machines actual hostname rather than "localhost" to auth things (such as sudo) if you don't have a working dynamic dns setup, and/or your hostname is not in the /etc/hosts file mapping to a reachable ip address, I've seen the auth fail. I wonder if this is why your not being able to login
[17:40	<pjoul>	lgl: dmesg
[17:40	<amenado>	Pokit can you paste in pastebin your /boot/grub/menu.lst  ?

[17:40	<Raits>	kakado: anyway, thank you, it's working great now:)

[17:43	<Mimi>	dave11 if you're installing and keeping windows, try wubi :)  otherwise... make sure youre burning at the LOWEST speed possible, and I assume youve checked md5sum
[17:43	<Mimi>	before burning
[17:43	<Callipyginous>	pjoul: Lol, trying that now... Thanks :)
[17:43	<rodolfo_>	pjoul, compiz-fusion is not enabled. I'm using metacity as my window decorator. So, what's wrong?
[17:43	<Mapp>	well i did what you said and i tried downloading them and it told me it couldn't download all of the respiratory indexes then i tried upgrading to hardy but it didn't work either it told me that there was an error during updating and i should check my network connection and retry but my network connection is fine

[17:44	<DBautell>	dave11 do you need the disc, or are you willing to mount -o?
[17:44	<pjoul>	StevenX: don't you mean "context menu"?
[17:44	<ikonia>	icqnumber: it should do, you don't need dynamic dns
[17:44	<Pokit>	jharkn i've tried twice, and so far its put me in safe mode both times
[17:44	<Mimi>	doug the lock means it "doesnt belong to you" silly i know... go to a terminal, type gksudo nautilus and navigate to that folder, then delete it
[17:44	<johannix>	canceled upgrade to hardy and now the option wont come up in update manager. any ideas?
[17:44	<Pokit>	jharkn could it be a windows issue and not grub?
[17:44	<amenado>	Pokit->	do you know which partition your windows is at? how about your linux?  per your paste, you seemed to have both pointing to hd0,1 ?
[17:45	<pjoul>	johannix: apt-get dist-upgrade
[17:45	<rodolfo_>	pjoul, so should I submit a BR to launchpad?
[17:45	<Pokit>	amenado XP is on same hard drive as linux. i installed windows first then linux after. so im assuming windows might be (hd0,0) since linux is (hd0,1)
[17:45	<jharkn>	pokit: odd, well if windows is booting I think it's windows' fault
[17:45	<StevenX>	pjoul, I think so. Is there a way to get to the context menu instead of to the "windows" menu.
[17:45	<ToM-X>	Hey, right I've ALMOST got ubuntu working perfectly!!! I need some help with my acpi! Can anyone help?
[17:45	<dave11>	DBautell: was trying to burn a live dvd and it gave me a hardware burn error the second it started
[17:46	<icqnumber>	ikonia, it(internet) will not work out of the box, because it is just can not,  its protected with a access key, which i need to set up
[17:46	<johannix>	pjoul: i ran that and it says "0 not upgraded"
[17:46	<pjoul>	johannix: that's bad man
[17:46	<Mimi>	!ask | Go ahead and ask ToM-X :D
[17:46	<ubotu>	Go ahead and ask ToM-X :D: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[17:46	<hawodi>	hello all
[17:46	<ikonia>	icqnumber: yes, but that's nothing to do with the situation I was dicussing with you
[17:46	<johannix>	pjoul: really?
[17:46	<Pokit>	jharkn: windows was working fine yesterday. then after using ubuntu upgrade manager it changed my menu.lst and now xp link puts me in safemode (the bottom option, the top one gives me an error)
[17:46	<amenado>	Pokit per your paste line 130 and 136  both point to same partition, this is incorrect
[17:46	<johannix>	is that it?
[17:46	<pjoul>	rodolfo_: first try to search if it has been already filled, then you can file a BR
[17:47	<pjoul>	johannix: yes
[17:47	<Pokit>	amenado, should i change line 130 to (hd0,0) ?
[17:47	<johannix>	pjoul: oof
[17:47]  * Mimi asks: Ummm I saved my session, because I don't want gnome-panel, but now everytime I log-in, all I get is the orange/cream screen before gnome loads... I wait and wait and gnome never loads.... so I gotta kill X and log in Failsafe...
[17:47	<rjonesx>	pjoul: i think i figured it out - the restricted drivers i need to run certain things have been turned off or commented out - anyone know how to install restricted nvidia drivers?
[17:47	<johannix>	i even tried downloading the alternate CD
[17:47	<ToM-X>	Right, I have a samsung r60 and I REALLY need to know my battery status but it ways hangs when acpi is disabled :@ any helpies?
[17:47	<puppetmaster>	Hello Everyone, I can't play my videos properly in ubuntu 8.04

[17:47	<pjoul>	johannix: you should download the cd and do brand new install
[17:47	<hawodi>	Am trying to ugrade from ubuntu feisty to gusty using the cdrom with luck.
[17:47	<El1>	Is anybody here good with nvidia drivers? I'm having severe problems installing them.
[17:47	<amenado>	Pokit wherever your windows partition is at, put that partition on line 130
[17:47	<johannix>	pjoul: i'm way beyond that
[17:47	<puppetmaster>	it keeps playing very slowly, so what should I do
[17:47	<puppetmaster>	?
[17:47	<johannix>	too much on this machine...
[17:47	<prakriti>	I'm running a distrobution upgrade and it's only coming down at about ~30k/s.  Are there faster mirrors?
[17:47	<Pokit>	amenado ok thanks ill give it a shotr
[17:47	<Callipyginous>	pjoul: That didnt work... i typed sudo visudo, and then once it came up, pressed I... Am i doing something wrong?
[17:48	<rodolfo_>	I dont know whose fault it is: intel(i915), mesa or the codec's? :S
[17:48	<johannix>	pjoul: it still knows that it's running gutsy
[17:48	<Mimi>	puppetmaster:  Have you tried installing Ubuntu restricted extras (thats what its called) from add remove ?
[17:48	<johannix>	just confused that it thinks it upgraded already

[17:48	<pjoul>	rjonesx: /usr/bin/jockey-gtk
[17:48	<co0lingFir3>	hi! is there something like ink-blot for hp deskjet 370?
[17:48	<jharkn>	pokit: the first option shouldn't work, it would load ubuntu if anything
[17:48	<jharkn>	pokit: I'm not sure why it would do safemode though
[17:48	<puppetmaster>	yes
[17:48	<pjoul>	Callipyginous: the try to edit it via nano: nano /etc/sudoers
[17:48	<puppetmaster>	and I installed gstreamer

[17:48	<Arand>	Where is the place to do a feature request fot nautilus?
[17:48	<jharkn>	pokit: you could try using 'super grub disk'
[17:48	<puppetmaster>	and all the required codecs
[17:49	<pjoul>	Callipyginous: nano is more comfortable for beginners than vi
[17:49	<puppetmaster>	I don't know what's wrong
[17:49	<pjoul>	johannix: do a fresh install of hardy
[17:49	<amenado>	manawenuz->	are you missing the ubuntu client from the drawing? or am i mis-understanding what is not working or connecting?

[18:04	<Koheleth>	ddrplayer512: instal the qt dev tools
[18:04	<mut80r>	SimplePlan: select manual in the ubuntu setup and edit your existing windows partition and shrink it down. then create another partition in the free space and install it there. windows and linux will be seperate and you will be able to boot both when you turn the pc on.

[18:06	<Noah0504>	pjoul: Okay, well, it's once solution to a problem I'm having.  I was just wondering.
[18:06	<ddrplayer512>	SimplePlan: The Desktop CD is usually the best choice for doing a fresh install.
[18:06	<Koheleth>	valchers: go to the software manager and search for qt, then scroll down a bit and mark qt-dev-tools
[18:06	<SimplePlan>	DBautell im installing

[18:07	<fysa>	oh god.  I have spent about 16 hours straight trying to get Ubuntu (or Wubi) installed.  It was the goddamn Cable Select setting on my Western Digital drive, causing errors in the ATA module.
[18:07	<ubotu>	dusk_: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of the latest edition. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[18:07	<SimplePlan>	DBautell im installing for the first time
[18:07	<bullium>	oh ok...you can use the alternate CD for the upgrade I believe
[18:07	<DBautell>	SimplePlan, than you can use either, I believe the alternate is text mode only, though
[18:07	<lopin>	duaneb stops doing anything at "Checking Package Manager" and the window goes gray
[18:07	<whileimhere>	from on tell me the CLI command to upgrade to 8.04 from 7.10?
[18:07	<bullium>	vignesh: oh ok...you can use the alternate CD for the upgrade I believe
[18:07	<ddrplayer512>	SimplePlan: The alternate install is good if you like text installs, and you are familiar with it. The alternate CD is also good to kickstart an upgrade.
[18:07	<manawenuz>	amenado: there's no Ubuntu client , except mine :) i'm trying to connect to 213.217.55.30 client with ubuntu and i'm unable to
[18:07	<vignesh>	wild_oscar, its better to use the send file option in the mobile phone or whatever device from which u wanna transfer the file...
[18:07	<SimplePlan>	DBautell then i shudnt check that box?
[18:07	<manawenuz>	amenado: but with windows it's fine
[18:07	<lopin>	duaneb: does it with the alt cd as well...
[18:07	<evand>	fysa: yikes!  Resolved now though?
[18:07	<wild_oscar>	and when I send a file from my WM5 device to ubuntu, bluez says it received it but I have no idea where it was saved!
[18:08	<amenado>	manawenuz->	from the drawing is it in the internet cloud? the 192.168.0.x cloud?
[18:08	<duaneb>	lopin, go to the terminal and type "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"
[18:08]  * Mimi asks: How can I reset my gnome session? I can't login unless its failsafe
[18:08	<pjoul>	Noah0504: okay, but it's not worth that troubles
[18:08	<vignesh>	bullium, how do i do that?
[18:08	<duaneb>	lopin, I'd guess that the mirrors are just slow
[18:08	<usicow>	since upgrading to 8.04 compiz crashes.. has anyone else had any problems?
[18:08	<wild_oscar>	vignesh: "and when I send a file from my WM5 device to ubuntu, bluez says it received it but I have no idea where it was saved!"
[18:08	<cybermad>	is there any way to get my friend data back from ubuntu?
[18:08	<Noah0504>	pjoul: Thanks for the heads up.
[18:08	<jharkn>	^root^: for example: you could install using ubuntu desktop cd then do "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop" to have xubuntu aswell
[18:08	<LetoThe2nd>	hi! is it possible to have dual-heads on a nvidia card with ubuntu?
[18:08	<DBautell>	SimplePlan, I would say probably not, the regular disc will be more comfortable
[18:08	<lopin>	duaneb, the local seems to be going faster...
[18:08	<pjoul>	Noah0504: peace
[18:08	<manawenuz>	amenado: i'll ask it someother how
[18:08	<duaneb>	lopin, good :)
[18:08	<vignesh>	wild_oscar, it will be saved in desktop by default..
[18:08	<fysa>	evand, yes.  if you hear of people having trouble and casper.log showing "SRST" and /dev/scd0 not found .. ask if they have a Western Digital drive. :P

[18:09	<lopin>	duaneb: the tools got a lock on apt-get
[18:09	<vignesh>	wild_oscar, install the bluetooth file sharing client.. that should solve ur problem..

[18:09	<pjoul>	Mimi: let's try :)
[18:09	<jburd>	So did I upgrade or downgrade my OS?

[18:14	<suweid>	pjoul, ddrplayer512: That link wants to sell ubuntu to me. I'm already sold on ubuntu. I want to know "diff 710 804"
[18:14	<manawenuz>	amenado: no it doesn't
[18:14	<bullium>	vignesh: it has to be the alternate CD not the original Live CD
[18:14	<SimplePlan>	can i get kubuntu after i install ubuntu ... like install the KDE thing ... will it b exactly like kubuntu? enlighten me
[18:14	<manawenuz>	amenado: it's just an unintelligent router :D
[18:14	<ddrplayer512>	I'll do some more looking.. okay?
[18:14	<pjoul>	suweid: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/804features/
[18:14	<amenado>	Zaqq->	if driver is not installed, then install it and make it work first
[18:14	<raphael_burnes>	how come 3 days ago I could install ubuntu-xen-server as a package on gutsy and now am no longer able to? (I get package not found)
[18:14	<lopin>	SimplePlan: Yes...
[18:14	<jharkn>	﻿SimplePlan: yes
[18:14	<raphael_burnes>	and what is the recommended way to install it? (on amd64)
[18:14	<vignesh>	bullium, alternate cd??? where do i get it from?
[18:14	<Zaqq>	amenado: i dont know how to install a driver ...
[18:14	<kitsune>	well I am off
[18:14	<lopin>	SimplePlan: Once you install ubuntu, install the Kubuntu-desktop metapackage in apt-get
[18:14	<SimplePlan>	then what happens to the gnome after i insstall kde?
[18:15	<lopin>	SimplePlan: That's kinda how Kubuntu does it...
[18:15	<arc_shmoo>	why doesnt the restricted driver for my proset wireless show up under restricted drivers in 8.04 as it did in 7.10
[18:15	<pjoul>	suweid: pulseaudio, gio, gnome2.22, firefox3
[18:15	<vignesh>	SimplePlan, you will be able to choose between gnome and kde from the sessions menu in the login screen..
[18:15	<lopin>	SimplePlan: It's still there... The gnome login manager can start kde, and vice versa
[18:15	<suweid>	pjoul, yes - it says that firefox 3 beta is bundled now. Why couldn't i just install it. Ohh, new gnome?
[18:15	<alteregoa>	houston i got a problem
[18:15	<amenado>	manawenuz->	if what you say is correct being un-intelligent, how does the packet gets forwarded to 213.217.55.30 ?
[18:15	<bullium>	vignesh: quickest way to download right now is using bit torrent http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ it's at the bottom of that page
[18:15]  * Mimi asks:  does anyone know how I can make gnome-panel NOT launch? :P
[18:15	<Koheleth>	ubuntus method of editing grub is in the dark ages
[18:15	<p28301016>	any one having problems with fstab
[18:15	<jharkn>	simpleplan: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/kde though I think it's a little outdated now, you should use "sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop" in the terminal
[18:15	<jburd>	And it's not like Ubuntu is a fairly new distro.
[18:15	<SimplePlan>	but wont that b extra load??? gnome and kde together .... shud i just get kubuntu then?
[18:15	<ddrplayer512>	huh?
[18:15	<vignesh>	bullium, okie .. ty..
[18:15	<Ashfire908>	is it worth it to verify a disc after burning a iso (of ubuntu 8.04)
[18:16	<amenado>	Zaqq->	you have to google for your nic card, visit the vendors web site please
[18:16	<bullium>	vignesh: np
[18:16	<vignesh>	SimplePlan, if u just want kde u can go for kubuntu..
[18:16	<pjoul>	suweid: if you don't want it - don't install it. that'sso  easy
[18:16	<suweid>	don't use apt-get to install kubuntu-desktop
[18:16	<jburd>	It's about time the distro gained stability during upgrades.
[18:16	<jharkn>	﻿SimplePlan: well they don't run at the same time
[18:16	<suweid>	If you do, you won't be able to remove it alter
[18:16	<suweid>	Use aptitude.
[18:16	<manawenuz>	amenado: it knows to redirect every packets to just one ip , which is .30
[18:16	<jharkn>	simpleplan: though you obviously have to store the files for each on disk
[18:16	<Dusk_>	i don't have system and home icons on my desktop...how can i get them??
[18:16	<valchers>	hello, I have problem with ubutnu 8.04 64 bit amd and skype, I cant install it, somebody can help me
[18:16	<alteregoa>	i am still disappointed of setting up multible displays in linux
[18:16]  * Mimi asks:  does anyone know how I can make gnome-panel NOT launch? :P
[18:16	<valchers>	hello, I have problem with ubutnu 8.04 64 bit amd and skype, I cant install it, somebody can help me
[18:16	<manawenuz>	amenado: btw both 213.217.55.29 & 30 are valid IP addresses
[18:16	<suweid>	pjoul: I want it, I just want to know why the hoopla! :)
[18:16	<jburd>	pathetic
[18:16	<manawenuz>	amenado: i mean static& valid
[18:16	<alteregoa>	valchers, there is a binary skype who runs
[18:16	<Koheleth>	valchers: did you see my reply
[18:16	<amenado>	manawenuz->	so i suspect it has some kind of filtering or only allows specific ip address to hit that .30
[18:17	<ddrplayer512>	suweid: http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-8.04-lts-desktop How about THIS? :)
[18:17	<pjoul>	suweid: just because all that new shiny software :)
[18:17	<bullium>	Is anyone running VMWare workstation on 8.10?
[18:17	<SimplePlan>	so if i want more options im better off DLing ubuntu and then the KDE stuff?
[18:17	<Steufeubeu>	yes
[18:17	<suweid>	ddrplayer512: I'm going to read that. :)
[18:17	<Koheleth>	valchers: go to the software manager in admin
[18:17	<amenado>	manawenuz->	well can you not directly connect to the .30 ?  or is it preventing you?
[18:17	<Steufeubeu>	I'm running VMWARE Workstation on 8.04
[18:17	<alteregoa>	something like skype static linked or something
[18:17	<ricanelite>	Steufeubeu, how is it running?
[18:17	<ddrplayer512>	suweid: I also think this will help: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/804overview
[18:17	<pjoul>	suweid: and mind that fact that hardy will be supported longer than gutsy
[18:17	<bullium>	Steufeubeu: where you running it on 7.10 and did the upgrade?
[18:17	<valchers>	and then
[18:17	<manawenuz>	amenado: i can directly connect to .30
[18:18	<bullium>	Steufeubeu: upgrade to 8.10 that is
[18:18	<manawenuz>	amenado: but i can't stablish a VPN connection with it
[18:18	<Steufeubeu>	ooops osrry
[18:18	<manawenuz>	amenado: i don't know why
[18:18	<Steufeubeu>	sorry ;-)
[18:18	<ZimCS>	Is there a guide on how to install VMWare Tools on 8.04?
[18:18	<jharkn>	simpleplan: well yeah probably but you could do "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop" from kubuntu instead
[18:18	<dave11>	how long is .710 going to be supported?
[18:18	<Koheleth>	valchers: search for qt
[18:18	<manawenuz>	amenado: and i'm asking you for a solution
[18:18	<manawenuz>	amenado: :)
[18:18	<amenado>	manawenuz->	can you not enable the sshd on .30 so you can ssh in?
[18:18	<jharkn>	afaik
[18:18	<suweid>	ddrplayer512: That last link was what I wanted from the start! Thanks a bunch
[18:18	<Steufeubeu>	ZimCS : yes I've posted here : http://communities.vmware.com/message/925886
[18:18	<dotech>	Could not connect to Facebook Chat at this time.
[18:18	<ZimCS>	thanks
[18:18	<manawenuz>	amenado: not right now , but i can in the morning
[18:18	<Koheleth>	valchers: then scroll down the list and mark qt-dev-tools for installation
[18:18	<ricanelite>	what is usually faster virtualbox or vmware? because i want to install windows vista and I had vista installed on virtualbox when i was running Gusty
[18:19	<dtrainer>	could anyone recommend a package for running internet cafes?
[18:19	<ricanelite>	but i have heard vmware is faster
[18:19	<suweid>	pjoul: Yeah, I don't know what "Support" rather than googling for help or coming here and complaining is. And I don't think either are going to be outlasted by "LTS" from canonical.
[18:19	<amenado>	manawenuz->	thats the first thing i would try, enable the sshd
[18:19	<manawenuz>	amenado: it's in somesort of organization out of town , which switch off all it's computers in the evening
[18:19	<ZimCS>	mine is 7.6.3, but that shouldn't makea a difference
[18:19	<SimplePlan>	what do more ppl prefer ubuntu or kubuntu?

[18:19	<dotech>	can someone confirm whether or not facebook chat allows you to send messages with Firefox 3b5 64-bit please?
[18:19	<amenado>	manawenuz->	possibly yeah..so testing it from your home and if the far end is inactive you cant do much

[18:23	<Steufeubeu>	﻿﻿bullium : Ok. Hope it will help you.
[18:23	<jburd>	Steufeubeu: yeah that's true.  I've always had to reinstall the OS.  Upgrading always breaks too many things.
[18:23	<xal2>	I updated to Ubuntu 8.04. I do not, however, have icons for OpenOffice.
[18:23	<skoop`>	Will Ubuntu work on a dell inspirion 1501's drivers?
[18:24	<xal2>	Where can I get these? I cannot find them in the usual directories.
[18:24	<SimplePlan>	which one looks "cooler" ubuntu or kubuntu?
[18:24	<frostburn>	bullium, are you trying to install vmware server?
[18:24	<JDogHerman>	any ideas on how to fix my vnc login issues?
[18:24	<User140>	hello
[18:24	<bullium>	frostburn: nope, workstation
[18:24	<jharkn>	﻿SimplePlan: if prefer gnome, but it's personal taste, google some screenshots or something
[18:24	<suweid>	SimplePlan, neither looks cool. But wait 'till kubuntu gets KDE 4.smthin'useful. Then kubuntu will win. ;)
[18:24	<xal2>	Where can I get the OpenOffice 2.4 icons? I cannot find them in the usual directories.
[18:24	<jharkn>	I*
[18:25	<n-iCe>	xal2 let's see
[18:25	<xal2>	I'm not sure if it's just a fault of the upgrade process.

[18:26	<tawt>	when i try to download something using synaptic/add-remove programs, is it supposed to act like i'm waiting in line to download?

[18:37	<Lardarse>	shadowvice: you mean apart from using the alt cd to install? i think there is, but you have to press F6 on the boot menu and type something in

[19:01	<graingert>	roffe__ it will say you can't without removing a dependancy, say yes
[19:01	<jajahuser29>	lastelement0 do you install restricted drivers?

[19:02	<welly>	Hello all - question about Wubi for Ubuntu. Does it run ubuntu in a window like a virtualisation product or some other way?

[19:02	<noodlesgc>	harking, im gonna try via command line, see if can get any good output

[19:03	<ratalin>	i was wondering if there was a way to grap a pid (like doing a fg) ? (i was doing a dist-upgrade and the ssh session was killed, the process is still running and i dont want to kill it)
[19:03	<Lapinux>	mut80r: well, i was watching the moving graph in system monitor, i just switched to a different tab and it dropped off

[19:03	<ubotu>	LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server.
[19:03	<Sake>	Jack_Sparrow: How do i do that on a server (no gui)? apt-get upgrade?
[19:04	<Lapinux>	mut80r: im stunned that it was that much though
[19:04	<CyberCod>	welly, it will run better installed via wubi... and you can remove it if you want to later
[19:04	<scizzo->	Sake: have you looked at the upgrade suggestions on the website?
[19:04	<kaminix>	Will someone please tell me this Hardy release is some kind of joke?`It's horrible! My network card no longer works out of the box, and now that I'm in my base system trying to reinstall everything, my work is being post-poned by the computer locking up EVERY time it's supposed to give a system beep (like each time I tab or press the damn left arrow key). Anyone has any idea as to how I can...
[19:04	<kaminix>	...atleast fix the looking up prob and I'll be fine!
[19:04	<izak_heron>	how can i add a theme to my themes folder in ubuntu?
[19:04	<ratalin>	Flannel: thanks but that shows the process i want to put it in the fg so i can use it
[19:04	<mut80r>	Lapinux: depends on hwo big the graph is. I know it eats half of mine when I maximize the window
[19:04	<CyberCod>	graingert: I installed the flashplugin-nonfree... how do I get firefox to use it instead of the other one?
[19:04	<welly>	CyberCod: i would do but i need to access windows fairly regularly throughout the day (unfortunately) and so rebooting every 1/2 hour or so might become a bit of a pain
[19:04	<Flannel>	ratalin: You can't
[19:04	<Jack_Sparrow>	kaminix, please tone it down...

[19:04	<ratalin>	Flannel: thanks :) damn
[19:04	<Sake>	scizzo-: you don't understand what I'm trying to do. What I'm doing is installing an older version of ubuntu from scratch, but making sure that it is updated, without jumping to a new version.
[19:05	<jajahuser29>	lastelement0  : type in terminal :lspci and the copy to pastebin page
[19:05	<Jack_Sparrow>	sake yes
[19:05	<Flannel>	ratalin: and actually, it'll kill itself in a bit when it times out.  You should look into GNU screen
[19:05	<Sake>	so in a nutshell, what's the difference between dist-upgrade and upgrade?
[19:05	<Flannel>	Jack_Sparrow: You do need dist-upgrade for updates
[19:05	<graingert>	CyberCod go to synaptics and search flash, remove (+purge) the one you don't need
[19:05	<jharkn>	﻿amikrop: alsamixer is common, try running it,see if it's what you're looking for

[19:06	<harking>	do-release-upgrdae eh?
[19:06	<Flannel>	Sake: since linux-image-* depends on linux-image-[version]-* and the version numbers change, its a new depends, you need dist-upgrade to bring it in
[19:06]  * harking tries it
[19:06	<Jack_Sparrow>	Flannel, Odd, I had never head that

[19:06	<noodlesgc>	harking i get error : could not calculate the upgrade.
[19:06	<Flannel>	Jack_Sparrow: its the only way to get new kernels.. most other packages won't need it, since their package names wont change, but most people consider kernels to be security updates ;)

[19:33	<v0lksman>	and what card do you ahve?
[19:33	<v0lksman>	*have
[19:33	<sploby>	v0lksman: i installed envyng but it says that the system don't support envy
[19:33	<amirman84>	are other people having problems with the ubuntu forums?
[19:33	<instantsoup>	urm thanks i guess... now i just need to know how to do that
[19:33	<sploby>	v0lksman: but i install envy legacy
[19:33	<jackdaw>	@amirman84 yeah its' hung, i think too much traffic
[19:33	<Fa>	yes i think the forums is overloaded lol
[19:33	<dbristow>	it's just very slow
[19:33	<v0lksman>	sploby: sorry...which did you install?  legacy or ng?
[19:33	<NukeSkyjumper>	the forums are overloaded even when there's not a fresh new release
[19:33	<instantsoup>	don't want to lose my windows and the files (ubuntu won't let me into my windows partition)
[19:34	<jackdaw>	@instantsoup in all likelyhood you haven't lost them
[19:34	<amirman84>	when did the 8.04 update go out? the forums were working fine last night
[19:34	<sploby>	v0lksman: both
[19:34	<NukeSkyjumper>	we should almost be telling people to wait a few weeks on installing Hardy, since support will be hard to get right now
[19:34	<v0lksman>	sploby: hahaha...hardy?
[19:34	<sploby>	v0lksman: Gutsy
[19:34	<twinkie_addict>	i have no issues getting ito my windows install
[19:34	<trait>	is there an alternative to alsamixer on hardy?
[19:34	<instantsoup>	well that's a good thing
[19:34	<twinkie_addict>	but haveing used wubi may have something to do with that
[19:34	<nucco>	how do i download ubuntu via rsync anyone?
[19:34	<NukeSkyjumper>	trait: i like aumix
[19:34	<graingert>	NukeSkyjumper: it's an lts, what you expect?
[19:34	<v0lksman>	sploby: ok...so ng won't work...you can remove it....what happens when you run envy and ask it to automatically install the ATI drivers?
[19:34	<neon>	does anyone knows how to make the webcam on an ASUS laptop to work under ubuntu, thanks
[19:35	<rym>	how can i check what PID is using /dev/video0
[19:35	<rym>	other than fuser
[19:35	<Jack_Sparrow>	NukeSkyjumper, or set to dual boot to keep existing setup while setting up Hardy
[19:35	<SimplePlan>	why is ubuntu better than windows?
[19:35	<prakriti>	neither is better SimplePlan
[19:35	<jackdaw>	@SimplePlan, it's not really better
[19:35	<trait>	the problem is, that alsamixer says:
[19:35	<sploby>	v0lksman: not even open
[19:35	<blue-frog_>	nucco: use a torretn it will be faster
[19:35	<jackdaw>	it's more of an apples / oranges situation
[19:35	<prakriti>	they are both tools, it really depends on what you wont
[19:35	<prakriti>	want
[19:35	<graingert>	SimplePlan: don't start!
[19:35	<v0lksman>	sploby: envy doesn't open?
[19:35	<emorri1>	﻿instantsoup: i think i came on after your first post, but for me i could not access by windows partition in hardy unless i rebooted
[19:35	<trait>	ALSA lib simple_none.c:1738:(simple_add1) helem (MIXER,'Headphone Playback Switch',0,2,0) appears twice or more
[19:35	<trait>	alsamixer: function snd_mixer_load failed: Invalid argument
[19:35	<Fa>	i am seeding right
[19:35	<simonft2>	﻿jackdaw: yes it is
[19:35	<Fa>	now
[19:35	<sploby>	v0lksman: yes
[19:35	<mut80r>	SimplePlan: different OS'es are better for different people. Use both and you can make an informed decision.
[19:35	<trait>	NukeSkyjumper
[19:35	<jackdaw>	@SimplePlan although if you wanted to learn programming you might find linux an easier situation
[19:35	<prakriti>	SimplePlan : its like saying why is a ferrari better than a pickup truck?
[19:35	<nucco>	blue-frog_: i wish to fix a broken download :)
[19:35	<Jack_Sparrow>	SimplePlan, wrong room for that discussion, this is support, you want #Ubuntu-offtopic
[19:35	<v0lksman>	sploby: ok...so its not installed properly...how did you install it?
[19:35	<rym>	ive been a windows user and pro-windows for ages
[19:36	<jackdaw>	@simonft2: well windows,  not vista ok :)
[19:36	<amirman84>	simple plan: because it's open source code allows constant updates to be made, it allows for a wide range of security and bug fixes and innovative software to be made for it
[19:36	<simonft2>	lol
[19:36	<sploby>	v0lksman: sudo apt-get envy
[19:36	<rym>	only now that windows crashes every 5 seconds i got a bit annoyed so switched
[19:36	<rym>	im still dualbooting though
[19:36	<mut80r>	rym: same here  =]
[19:36	<jackdaw>	has anyone noticed that update-manager is fucked too
[19:36	<SimplePlan>	is it gonna make my computer way faster than it is on windows?
[19:36	<graingert>	SimplePlan: it's elitist, it's intellectually challenging and fun
[19:36	<mut80r>	!slow | jackdaw
[19:36	<ubotu>	jackdaw: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of the latest edition. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[19:36	<graingert>	SimplePlan: quite faster
[19:36	<Assid>	err anyone wanna help me with this?
[19:36	<kelvie_>	Anyone else have an issue with "Setting up samba-common" freezing?
[19:36	<btse>	anybody had success booting a dell latitude c640 with 8.04?
[19:36	<jackdaw>	@ubotu ->	thanks mr obvious bot

[19:37	<Assid>	i cant find the svn scripts for nautilis
[19:37	<Jack_Sparrow>	!language >	jackdaw,
[19:37	<nucco>	au contraire :) my ubuntu is crashing every few days :) for no apparent reason. today it suddenly developed a bad block on the HDD while playing music, I had to do a clean install
[19:37	<ubotu>	Assid: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[19:37	<Assid>	mut80r: i know how to ask
[19:37	<neon>	does anyone knows how to make the webcam on an ASUS laptop to work under ubuntu, thanks
[19:37	<amirman84>	simple plan: it's faster for me, but more so than the speed increasing, the preformance increases, if you have a decent graphics card you'll love compiz-fusion desktop effects
[19:37	<jackdaw>	@Assid: do you want svn hooks in nautilus?
[19:37	<Jack_Sparrow>	btse, I have a c640 here, what is the prob.
[19:37	<jackdaw>	@Assid: because that'd be really quite nice, i'd like that too
[19:37	<mehal88>	okay, i have mounted the hardy image with gmount, but im not sure what to do from here
[19:37	<graingert>	nucco: check the smartmon infomation on drive
[19:37	<Assid>	jackdaw: yep
[19:37	<SimplePlan>	prakriti ur name means nature?
[19:37	<btse>	Jack_Sparrow,  no boot cramfs read error
[19:38	<sploby>	v0lksman: i tried install the drive with ati-driver-installer-8, but when i restart my screen i a Blank screen and doesn't load nothing
[19:38	<v0lksman>	sploby: can you pastebin or put here the output of dpkg -l envy
[19:38	<Assid>	i installed the scripts package  didnt help
[19:38	<SimplePlan>	is ubutu compatible wit itunes ?
[19:38	<mut80r>	Assid:  apt-get nautilus-svn-scripts
[19:38	<jackdaw>	@Assid: i guess i just use the terminal a whole bunch so i don't notice. if you're desperate you could probably knock up some simple nautilus bindings in python right?
[19:38	<Jack_Sparrow>	btse, Did the live cd run and install for you
[19:38	<nucco>	graingert: i know... its one of those stupid HDDs that park every few seconds, but still its less than two weeks old, so i shouldn't be having issues just yet
[19:38	<Assid>	mut80r: did that .. didnt help
[19:38	<instantsoup>	emorri1 yeah thats not the problem, i can't boot into my windows anymore :x
[19:38	<seledec>	Envy 0.9.10 es modelo para el hardy
[19:38	<warrenDumX>	hi
[19:38	<v0lksman>	sploby: yeah I wouldn't suggest going that route...not until we exhaust the other ways
[19:38	<gombi1977>	How do I restore MBR in Vista if I uninstall Ubuntu? I would like to install it on a virtual machine instead.
[19:38	<simonft2>	!spanish
[19:38	<ubotu>	Aquí solamente hablamos inglés. Para Español, por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es o #kubuntu-es - allí obtendrá más ayuda.
[19:38	<btse>	Jack_Sparrow, no live cd won't work, boots and then halts
[19:38	<nucco>	it ! seledec
[19:38	<SimplePlan>	is ubutu compatible wit itunes ????
[19:39	<nucco>	it! | seledec
[19:39	<jackdaw>	@instantsoup: ok well try this: get to the grub boot screen, and do the thing so that you can type in commands yourself
[19:39	<mut80r>	Assid:  apt-get remove nautilus-svn-scripts and try downloading it again
[19:39	<Jack_Sparrow>	btse, try this  At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"
[19:39	<mut80r>	gombi: the vista DVD
[19:39	<amirman84>	simple plan: ubuntu has its own music managing software choices that are a million times better than itunes
[19:39	<genii>	SimplePlan: iTunes is not natively compliant to linux
[19:39	<warrenDumX>	i have some empty dvds and i can't access them, also there are no errors messages (dmesg too), what can i do? (other empty cds are working)
[19:39	<amirman84>	i personally like amarock
[19:39	<sploby>	v0lksman: ii  envy           0.9.10-0ubuntu install the ATI or the NVIDIA driver
[19:39	<instantsoup>	yes?
[19:39	<CyberCod>	SimplePlan: nope, but it has programs similar to iTunes... and it works with most Ipods
[19:39	<ttt-->	im trying to upgrade to 8.04 but i get an authentication error
[19:39	<gombi1977>	You mean Vista DVD MBR recovery?
[19:39	<btse>	Jack_Sparrow, ok thanks...  brb!
[19:39	<Assid>	mut80r: downloading what again?
[19:39	<jackdaw>	@instant soup: then you need to do: grub>	rootnoverify (hd0,0) <return>	makeactive <return>	chainloader +1 <return>	boot <return>
[19:39	<Assid>	err one sec
[19:39	<jackdaw>	@instant soup: and it'll work
[19:39	<Assid>	phone call
[19:39	<Assid>	mut80r: hold up
[19:39	<nucco>	anyone know how to retrieve an ubuntu iso via rsync?
[19:39	<simonft2>	﻿amirman84: not if you want to use a ipod
[19:40	<mut80r>	Assid:   apt-get remove nautilus-svn-scripts          apt-get install nautilus-svn-scripts
[19:40	<instantsoup>	ok let me write that down
[19:40	<v0lksman>	sploby: neat...didn't know it was in the repos....ok...so run envy in a shell.  it should barf some output if it doesn;t want to launch
[19:40	<jackdaw>	@instant soup: and then once you're happy that your windows is safe and sound you need to add those commands to your /boot/grub/menu.lst and you'll be all set
[19:40	<amirman84>	simonft2: there are ways to get linux software to sync with your ipod depending on what gen ipod you have
[19:40	<jackdaw>	@instant soup, you can look here for a nice article about all the fun things you can do with grub:
[19:40	<v0lksman>	sploby: the reason I'm pushing this is cause envy is the best way to get them installed...
[19:40	<jackdaw>	@instantsoup: http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4622
[19:40	<genii>	SimplePlan: For detailed info http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/itunes
[19:41	<kelvie_>	OK better question: if my dist upgrade crashes, how do I recover from it?
[19:41	<instantsoup>	alright im gonna try that thank you
[19:41	<jackdaw>	@instantsoup ->	it's a problem that i got stuck with for quite a while, it's something that really doesn't need to be exposed to people who arn't interested in it (or noobs) the bootloader i mean.
[19:41	<sploby>	v0lksman: yes i know, but can you pass me the sudo apt-get of envy legacy
[19:41	<jackdaw>	@instantsoup ->	good luck
[19:41	<Pitel>	Hi, I upgraded to 8.04 and installed firefox-2, but my extensions aren;t working here. why? and how to fix it?
[19:41	<neon>	help can't access e-sata, hd gets recognized once i plug it, but no files show once i click on it
[19:41	<jackdaw>	well, i guess i'll just do some actual work instead of upgrading my distro
[19:41	<v0lksman>	sploby: pardon?
[19:41	<jackdaw>	byee
[19:41	<instantsoup>	just so you know, if it works you are my official hero :)
[19:42	<mut80r>	jackdaw: cya
[19:42	<jackdaw>	@instant soup ask someone or google about editing the grub settings to work with windows when you've convinced yourself it works
[19:42	<jackdaw>	laters
[19:42	<kesi>	anyone got a response to me?>
[19:42	<sploby>	v0lksman: how do i install envy legacy on terminal
[19:42	<mudd`Hossam>	hello, can i get my NVIDIA 680i onboard sound (High definition audio) to work over SPDIF?
[19:42	<CyberCod>	ok
[19:42	<jackdaw>	@kesi  can you rpt the question?
[19:42	<CyberCod>	now I am really confused
[19:42	<rjonesx>	anyon know how to tell ubuntu to use restricted nvidia drivers in Hardy?
[19:42	<mut80r>	!audio | mudd`Hossaim
[19:42	<ubotu>	mudd`Hossaim: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[19:42	<nucco>	kelvie_: instantsoup what is it about grub?
[19:42	<jackdaw>	@mudd`Hossam there should be an option in alsa-mixer
[19:42	<CyberCod>	I downloaded and ran the java installer .bin ... still no java in firefox
[19:43	<Assid>	mut80r: didnt help
[19:43	<v0lksman>	sploby: if it is in the repos then sudo apt-get install envy....however I remember always having to install it from a .deb I download from the authors site...gimme a sec I'll check
[19:43	<graingert>	CyperCod: you need the icedtea plugin
[19:43	<mut80r>	Assid: I don't know then. Try the forums or someone else in here.
[19:43	<rjonesx>	can you run updater from the command line?
[19:43	<mut80r>	rjonesx: yes
[19:43	<jackdaw>	@rjonesx sudo update-manager -d
[19:43	<CyberCod>	via firefox? or synaptic?

[19:44	<jackdaw>	@mudd`Hossam yeaha you have to sort of turn on the right options in the alsa mixer, it's probably easier to use the gnome version but i found that the command line one had more controlls on it
=== robert__ is now known as Warp4

[19:47	<jackdaw>	@Assid sorry i was talking to someone else about grub
[19:47	<obf213>	for some reason i need the dreeded restart to fix this. which is suppose to not be necesary, but if i lok out and back in, i have no tool pars show up at all, neither does alt -f2 etc
[19:47	<jackdaw>	@Obf213 are you logged in as a user? i had a problem like that when i was booting through "safe mode"

[20:05	<IanBeyer>	mut80r: I'm just trying to install base, not add packages from the repo
[20:06	<Jack_Sparrow>	rjonesx, If you got a partial update eaarlier it could be causing issues..   it should not effect cairo or your restricted drivers unless your apt-get update failed to get all the repo lists and then you installed cairo or the drivers

[20:07	<rjonesx>	Jack_Sparrow: first off, thanks for your help so far, I really appreciate it. I just used the Update Manager yesterday to update from Gutsy to Hardy - would that have completed successfully if it did not fully download the different updates?
[20:07	<dbristow>	leonardo_: this isn't ubuntu specific: mount -o loop /path/to/iso /mnt/point/here
[20:07	<fdkrew>	Is anyone having problems with repos taking long time to update?

[20:12	<DBautell>	joonas_, you might try adding -R or --recursive to your chmod, which will set permissions for everything below your target
[20:12	<IanBeyer>	nucco: is there a way to configure the default network interface on install to do something other than DHCP?
[20:12	<nucco>	Baby_Shambl3s: replace /dev/sdb with /dev/sdb1 or whatever your partition is :)

[20:31	<jfrey>	I've been running hardy for a couple of weeks now and today it's been missing the application/power bar from both the top and bottom of the screen. The only change I made before this happened was to evolution which I removed. And help or pointer and how t even phase this so I can find an answer on google?
[20:31	<IanBeyer>	nucco: that would be the console. I would imagine that;s been, erm, tested extensively.
[20:31	<Pelo>	craig_, I instaled in 7.10 from the repos,  right now it doesn,t work on hardy ,  there are no hardypacakges for it, but do a search on digg there was an article last week on installling the lastest vmware server on hardy
[20:31	<dassouki_>	DBautell, any idea how to do that ?
[20:31	<kevin4381>	nucco:  - I will try that in a minute if this doesn't work

[20:31	<mut80r>	kevin4381: no idea. that's what I had to enter to get it working on my PC.
[20:31	<Pelo>	jfrey, alt-f2 : gnome-panel
[20:31	<andresmh>	i mean, the config file where the default windows manager is set?
[20:31	<Moncky>	elektronik123: not sure sorry
[20:32	<stroyan>	lunartear:  You need to have tight permissions on .ssh/* files or they may not be used.  make them "chmod 600" so only your account can access them.  You could also check /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the side you are connecting to.
[20:32	<nixnoob>	hey i just upgraded to hardy and i have no sound any ideaas?

[20:45	<StevenX>	how do i install a .deb package?
[20:45	<shane2peru>	does anyone know why my hdd lets me write for a little bit, and then it changes to read only filesystem?
[20:45	<Stiny>	Oh by the way, I just LOVE the new version of Ubuntu, because it supports my integrated intel video card and I don't have to configure it. ^^
[20:45	<ompaul>	iKar, with bittorrent that is the only way - and the iso file on a hard drive not on a CD/DVD
[20:45	<nucco>	StevenX: just double-click it
[20:45	<MountainX>	IcemanV9 - lol thanks for info about bot :)
[20:45	<nibsa1242b>	kevin4381: intel

[20:45	<retalin>	if i am in a dir and i want to find a specific ip in say 20 files, what command would i use, i know its cat but what would i pass to it ?

[20:46	<jfrey>	Pelo: Thanks. Gnome-panel was removed when I removed parts of evolution, but I reinstalled it and it seems to be working again.
[20:46	<tushyd>	kevin4381, it should work with nvidia, gutsy ran on my old lappy with an nvidia 8600
[20:46	<xFlipx>	mut80r, did GG work as well?

[20:48	<kevin4381>	but it doesn't
[20:48	<ashbringer>	Does anyone know of a bug in the update manager where it hangs indefinitely on the "checking package manager" stage? I saw a bug for the hardy updater, but I think that would have been fixed by now
[20:48	<IcemanV9>	mysterycool: you could use dyndns.org to display your website

[20:48	<max__>	private chat with me

[20:48	<mariano>	come si installano i plugin adio e video?
[20:49	<iKar>	because when I burn it on cd id wont work
[20:49	<nucco>	iKar: you can use rsync to fix it, been trying to find out how, nobody seems to know
[20:49	<mut80r>	iKar: you need to burn it as an image, not a file
[20:49	<milly1234>	I've noticed since going from gutsy to hardy my wireless signal strength has dropped, is there something they did differently I can undo?
[20:49	<mut80r>	iKar: and as slowly as possible
[20:49	<flithm>	hey everyone... since upgrading to hardy I get all these errors like: "df: `/home/tim/.gvfs': Transport endpoint is not connected" when I run df, and same if I ls my home dir... anyone know what this is about?
[20:49	<gogeta>	iKar you can check the md5 to make shure
[20:49	<shane2peru>	ok, lets try another question, I just burnt up my cdrom drive on my wifes computer, anyone know how to install ubuntu with no cdrom?
[20:49	<Arky44>	iKar: did you burn it to the CD as a CD image, or just burn it directly?
[20:49	<priman>	do anyone know where i can find drivers for my hp pavilion dv5095ea laptop?

[20:50	<ubuntuROX>	does anyone know where the torrent is for the alternate cd?
[20:50	<max__>	install envy
[20:50	<mut80r>	nucco: that is dependant on his software
[20:50	<iKar>	as cd image I know what I was doing and I did at 16x
[20:50	<Skapare>	nucco: if you have a bad/corrupt image, rsync can fix it with the right options ... I did this just 2 days ago with a bad copy of a Debian DVD I found

[20:56	<nucco>	neztiti: you don't need to do anything. you're probably connected to a slow mirror that's all. it should go away in a while, or is it your general net connection slow?

[21:01	<dystopianray>	TheWarden: yes, you can write to FAT partitions

[21:02	<phiras>	Anyone could help me please
[21:02	<fbc>	Wow, the server is back! I wasn't able to get a connection for a long time.
[21:02	<milly1234>	my wireless connection has gone belly up since my upgrade to hardy
[21:02	<dystopianray>	TheWarden: i'm not sure why it'd be read-only, you should have full read/write access
[21:02	<Skapare>	and the canonical store doesn't even have pre-ordering for the 8.04 DVDs, yet (just CDs) ... and the first store page still says 7.10 is the latest (someone needs to update another page)
[21:02	<kindofabuzz>	milly1234: welcome to the main problem with Hardy

[21:03	<gogeta>	Skapare i orderd a 8.04 cd :)
[21:03	<PKsteR>	I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 and now it wont detect my nvidia GPU and it always start in low graphics mode, so I install the nvidia drivers every time but still it wont recognize the GPU on next boot
[21:03	<Skapare>	gogeta: and you can do that for a CD ... I want a DVD
[21:03	<jaffarkelshac>	what do you mean browsing the network mut80r

[21:03	<mut80r>	jaffarkelshac: he needs to "browse" his network to find the windows machines on it.
[21:03	<milly1234>	lol, hope hardy has some updates for nvidia users and wireless users soon
[21:03	<priman>	nibsa: wifi, graphics and sound are thw most important ones
[21:03	<kindofabuzz>	for you people upgrading, alot quicker if you use the alternate install cd to upgrade,  with the cd i only had to download about 300 packages, got the other 1000+ off the cd
[21:03	<DBautell>	change it quick!
[21:03	<fbc>	gogeta,  Do you know anyway to specify the video drive and monitor size, etc.?? I don't see that anymore in hardy.
[21:04	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: if I'm still here, lemme know how it works..
[21:04	<graingert>	milly1234: nvidia is fine
[21:04	<flithm>	hey does anyone know of a good segmenting download manager for gnome?
[21:04	<Dusk_>	IcemanV9: oh thanks i've done it from the router
[21:04	<scizzo->	milly1234: works fine for me with nvidia
[21:04	<Skapare>	gogeta: but I'll take DVD isos ... I have bandwidth to my server and can burn them there
[21:04	<fbc>	flithm, I think downloader for X does that.
[21:04	<_lemsx1_>	flithm: like that front-end for wget ?
[21:04	<tehgeek>	Hey guys....I've just updated to Hardy, and now my Evolution crashes every so often and complains about an unsafe exit when I restart it.  Anyone know the problem?
[21:04	<LOGAN>	can you guys check ubuntu.com in IE??
[21:04	<Skapare>	gogeta: just can't do torrent on it
[21:04	<nucco>	kindofabuzz: you still *downloaded* the CD right?
[21:04	<Daisuke_Ido>	i wonder how big the entire repository is...
[21:04	<kindofabuzz>	Administrator_: ok, well about 30 minutes left to install, wehn you see me log ogg here, that means i'm rebooting, if i don't come back within 10 minutes, it didn't work =)
[21:04	<flithm>	_lemsx1_: yeah except that one doesn't so segmented downloads I think
[21:05	<Daisuke_Ido>	LOGAN, since probably 99% of us are using ubuntu now, possibly not, what's wrong?
[21:05	<nibsa1242b>	flithm: just use wget from the command line, its useful
[21:05	<flithm>	fbc: yeah d4x doesn't seem so modern to me
[21:05	<kindofabuzz>	nucco: yeah, torrent, only took like 45 minutes
[21:05	<_lemsx1_>	flithm: what do you mean by "segmented" ?
[21:05	<milly1234>	I had a heck of a time getting my nvidia 7300gt 512mb working, every time I told it to use the driver for it said it was and restarted and wasn't using it when I restarted, had to install them with apt-get and edit my xorg.conf
[21:05	<flithm>	nibsa1242b: wget doesn't do segmenting
[21:05	<Stiny>	Can anyone just please help me? :-( I don't know how to get my soundcard to work.
[21:05	<dystopianray>	LOGAN: i have IE, what's the problem?
[21:05	<Daisuke_Ido>	i stand corrected :)
[21:05	<PKsteR>	guys i need help I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04 and now it wont detect my nvidia GPU
[21:05	<flithm>	_lemsx1_: like break up the download into X pieces and download them simultaneously
[21:05	<LOGAN>	Daisuke_Ido : iguess ubuntu doent need more windows users then
[21:05	<nucco>	kindofabuzz: *silly me*,
[21:05	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: hehe.. I can't grep any bcm on lsmod
[21:05	<LOGAN>	the site looks incomplete under IE
[21:05	<Daisuke_Ido>	LOGAN, wait what?
[21:05	<Daisuke_Ido>	ah...
[21:05	<_lemsx1_>	flithm: like download accelerator ?
[21:05	<joshua__>	Yes i would like to have file sharing, but if i open up "Network" i can go to Windows Network" then "Workgroup" but after that it is empty
[21:05	<flithm>	_lemsx1_: yeah!
[21:06	<LOGAN>	only an image, no text
[21:06	<kindofabuzz>	Administrator_: you wanna try what i'm gonna do?
[21:06	<Daisuke_Ido>	i thought you were asking if we in particular were using IE
[21:06	<_lemsx1_>	flithm: use wine and run that then ;-)
[21:06	<dystopianray>	LOGAN: scroll down
[21:06	<jburd>	The Ubuntu livecd doesn't show any display on my box.
[21:06	<LOGAN>	nono lol
[21:06	<ubus>	hey does ubuntu 8.04 comes with inkscape?
[21:06	<LOGAN>	hmm
[21:06	<flithm>	_lemsx1_: hey that's not a bad idea :)
[21:06	<mattywarr>	is there a definitive guide to setting up and using Compiz?
[21:06	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: sure.. I got nothing to lose
[21:06	<koomber>	not quite Ubuntu but:  I can only get ubuntu to run in Raid mode on my Vostro 200, is it possible to install vista in raid mode and do I risk damaging my hdd if I do?
[21:06	<_lemsx1_>	flithm: that should work
[21:06	<Arky44>	ubus: yes
[21:06	<LOGAN>	oh my that looks weird
[21:06	<nucco>	joshua__: you can do "Places >	Connect to server" and then select "windows share" and just type the name of the windows PC inside the "server" field
[21:06	<Administrator_>	except maybe time.. :)
[21:06	<fbc>	flithm, A good segmented downloaded it bittorrent... very fast too...
[21:06	<Daisuke_Ido>	time to run back to the laptop to finish backing things up
[21:06	<dystopianray>	LOGAN: it looks a bit messed up, but it's usable
[21:06	<Daisuke_Ido>	so i can reformat :D
[21:06	<LOGAN>	yeah i guess so
[21:07	<hyjal>	any way to make my NTFS partitions automount in hardy like they did in gutsy? do I have to edit fstab manually?
[21:07	<flithm>	fbc: haha thanks :)
[21:07	<Daisuke_Ido>	i wonder if it's possible to recreate my dell reinstall partition with hardy...
[21:07	<joshua__>	then what?
[21:07	<noelferreira>	sometimes using compiz i open some programs that only display the window bars. Every text and buttons in it disappear: any help?
[21:07	<joshua__>	it just closes
[21:07	<LOGAN>	weird image not found combined with the image lol
[21:07	<Daisuke_Ido>	since it's feisty right now

[21:07	<koomber>	daisuke:  You having troubles with Dell Ubuntu install?
[21:07	<ubus>	﻿Arky44, now Im using Live CD 8.04 and there is no sign of Inkscape in Live mode? is it ok? will inkscape be instaled after I install ubuntu od disk?
[21:07	<_lemsx1_>	hyjal: do you mean get detected by the installer and put in /etc/fstab ? just do it by hand
[21:07	<Daisuke_Ido>	koomber, no, i've been upgrading since feisty and i'm looking to do a clean install
[21:07	<PKsteR>	milly1234: I have the exact same problem
[21:08	<scizzo->	ubus: no matter what you can still install it from the repos
[21:08	<Daisuke_Ido>	but the recovery partition is feisty, i was wondering if there were a way to update that to a hardy recovery :)
[21:08	<PKsteR>	can you help resolve it?
[21:08	<ptn107>	ubus: inkscape is not installed by default
[21:08	<pr0gr4mm3r>	Hi, is there a driver available for the ATI HD 2400 Pro video card?
[21:08	<joshua__>	do i need the windows name of the pc or do i need the ip?
[21:08	<Arky44>	ubus: hmm...i thought it was...you can always install it later with "sudo apt-get install inkscape" typed into a terminal
[21:08	<Arky44>	ubus: it still might be though :)
[21:08	<RunKidRun>	hey guys, i tried an internet upgrade from my gutsy install <---- it failed, and now, x won't start , gnome nothing...how can i finish the upgrade via the alterative install cd without a GUI?

[21:08	<nucco>	joshua__: the windows name of the pc will work fine too :)
[21:08	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: ahhh, the module's name is b43, right?
[21:08	<nibsa1242b>	hyjal: some people have had issues with it changing how the system sees the device ( they see them how as sata instead of ide) if that is the case you probably need to edit fstab
[21:08	<dassouki_>	0% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.88.31)	<<-- why is very slow, is there another link thati  can use

[21:10	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: doing it
[21:10	<M4rotku>	hello, can any1 tell me how to upgrade from the 8.04 beta to the actual release?
[21:10	<karamazov>	how can i boot in single user mode
[21:10	<nucco>	bnjmn: technically, the only difference btw the ubuntu "versions" is just the default set of packages :)
[21:10	<Stiny>	Can anyone help get my soundcard to work?
[21:10	<nucco>	karamazov: boot into recovery mode
[21:11	<dystopianray>	M4rotku: simply perform a standard package update and you're done
[21:11	<kindofabuzz>	nucco: and the kernel
[21:11	<IcemanV9>	ubus: try to install inkscape in livecd mode as long as you have enough memory to try

[21:11	<_mattd>	does anyone here have experience with installing ThruDB?
[21:11	<hyjal>	hm okay. if I want to add the partitions to fstab myself, do I need to know a UUID like the predefined entries ones have? i.e. UUID= a very long string of some sort.
[21:11	<mut80r>	koomber: you should be able to drop the SATA driver into the windows install and get device manager to manually update the driver. then you can have both OS'es in SATA AHCI
[21:11	<nucco>	kindofabuzz: which is also a package, or am I wrong?
[21:11	<karamazov>	ok i'll try that
[21:11	<dassouki_>	nucco, Arky44 u guys don't happen to know why from gutsy to hardy my sound stopped working :(
[21:11	<nucco>	hyjal: no, using the /dev node is enough
[21:11	<carlos>	please, could anybody help me?
[21:11	<kindofabuzz>	nucco: yeah, i guess it is, but it's the "brain"

[21:12	<koomber>	mut80r: that sounds plausible.  I'm sorry to say I'm a total novice.  and I don't know what you mean

[21:12	<IcemanV9>	carlos: you haven't state the problem yet; please do tell and someone will help ya
[21:12	<kindofabuzz>	for you people upgrading, alot quicker if you use the alternate install cd to upgrade,  with the cd i only had to download about 300 packages, got the other 1000+ off the cd
[21:12	<Arky44>	prettyricky: more stable, more packages to download, in some cases faster, in general just better :)
[21:12	<RunKidRun>	anyone :(
[21:12	<erUSUL>	karamazov: server has no GUI
[21:12	<mut80r>	koomber: google: "Install SATA AHCI driver after windows install"
[21:12	<dystopianray>	karamazov: server allows you to select some preset roles and it'll install the appropriate packages
[21:12	<Starnestommy>	RunKidRun: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[21:12	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: okay.. how do I modprobe?

=== elektronik123 is now known as elektronik123ide
[21:13	<prettyricky>	Well I havent really seen any new packages, does it matter if I install the cd version or the upgrade version. Or is there no difference?
[21:13	<Flare183>	Administrator_: open a terminal and type in sudo modprobe bcm43xx
[21:13	<linkmaster03>	xsane immedietly exits with this on 7.10: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[21:13	<erUSUL>	RunKidRun: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade if your sources already point to hardy
[21:13	<Flare183>	oops crap
[21:13	<Batch>	When i use acpi=off as a boot option, it boots fine but wireless does not work, when i use acpi=on or just not include it as a boot option wireless LED goes blue :D BUT the desktop does not boot and just goes to a black screen, Suggestions?
[21:13	<_lemsx1_>	karamazov: server also does not change your network dynamically... do not use desktop for that

[21:14	<carlos>	it couldnt connect, check internet status and that
[21:14	<shadow420>	I guess I will try to upgrade gutsy
[21:14	<_lemsx1_>	karamazov: unless you know what you are doing ;-) (and can stand avahi+NetworkManager+resolvconf+whateverelse messing up your network configs)
[21:14	<fbc>	How do you change your monitor type in hardy?? Is there a graphical tool like in Gutsy or do I have to manually edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
[21:14	<scizzo->	!slow | carlos

[21:14	<jburd>	shadow420: I've had nothing but problems with Hardy.  I'd first suggest trying out the livecd.  Mine doesn't even show me a display.
[21:14	<kindofabuzz>	bug*

[21:14	<IcemanV9>	carlos: ah. the servers are being overloaded. try a different mirror for now.
[21:14	<priman>	evand: how?
[21:15	<evand>	priman: there should be a shortcut on your desktop to your windows filesystem
[21:15	<carlos>	yep i tried with the local here and the central node
=== Griverr is now known as Griver

[21:15	<vixmusic01>	Hi my mouse stopped working and I need a keyboard command to shut down. Thanks for any help.
[21:15	<evand>	priman: try alt-f2 and type /host
[21:15	<Stiny>	I still need help. I'm being really sad now. :(
[21:15	<karamazov>	in /etc/group file, does adm:x:4:ugur mean ugur is an administrator?
[21:15	<priman>	vixmusic: click the power off button
[21:15	<bruenig>	hmm
[21:15	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: nope.. didn't work. I guess it's back to gutsy for now :(
[21:15	<vistakiller>	sudo shutdown -P now
[21:15	<kindofabuzz>	vixmusic01: sudo shutdown -P now
[21:15	<erUSUL>	karamazov: yep
[21:15	<Starnestommy>	karamazov: adm isn't the admin group
[21:15	<joshua__>	Nucco: did you give up on me?
[21:15	<jburd>	fbc: I've had only troubles.  the desktop cd (gutsy works perfectly fine) for hardy doesn't even show me a display when it starts up.
[21:16	<obf213>	i try that it never works, it just logs me right back into my session, then i have to try again, i get a black screen have to kill xm then finally it recognizes i want a remote session but my old session is lost
[21:16	<jburd>	fbc: the upgrade has borked my box
[21:16	<vixmusic01>	is there a list of keyboard commands somewhere?
[21:16	<Dekkard>	anyone get a link to an alternate install iso torrent?

[21:16	<bintrue|work>	vixmusic01:  shutdown -h now
[21:16	<kindofabuzz>	vixmusic01: or sudo shutdown -r now (for reboot)
[21:16	<joshua__>	oh
[21:16	<fbc>	jburd, The method I used to upgrade was to download and bur the alternative CD and upgrade from that, then download all the updates.
[21:16	<kindofabuzz>	Administrator_: yeah i have a feeling i'll be using gutsy to for awhile
[21:16	<joshua__>	you know iceman?
[21:16	<linkmaster03>	xsane exits immedietly on startup with (7.10) :: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[21:16	<bruenig>	ubuntu is up to date with the rolling distros for a few days, wooo!
[21:16	<jburd>	fbc: Exactly what I did.
[21:17	<joshua__>	i cant view files shared on a windows network
[21:17	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: how about ndiswrapper?
[21:17	<karamazov>	to add the user "ugur" to group of root, should i edit the line "root:x:0" to "root:x:0:ugur" in the /etc/group file?
[21:17	<vixmusic01>	I don't have a CLI - terminal is not open
[21:17	<kindofabuzz>	Administrator_: if you google around there are like 30 ways people have gotten there to work
[21:17	<Starnestommy>	karamazov: adding them to the root group won't do anything

[21:18	<bruenig>	j and - are redundant
[21:18	<bruenig>	Starnestommy:
[21:18	<Skapare>	BTW, I'm running 7.10 on an old 400 MHz P-II, 128MB RAM, 14GB HD ... runs fine with one strange glitch (not a performance issue) ... hopefully 8.04 will be about as fast (and hopefully fix the glitch)
[21:18	<IcemanV9>	joshua__: ah. not familiar with samba myself, but have tried it before and it works. i believe it's on the windows side for not allow you to view; permission issue?
[21:18	<jburd>	fbc: My (any user for that matter) GNOME desktop does not show icons in the menus, does not render using the correct themes, does not use desktop effects, and the power manager refuses to budge
[21:18	<karamazov>	ok, to give my user administrator privileges, what should i change in the /etc/group file
[21:18	<LukeL>	Skapare have you thought about xubuntu?
[21:18	<linkmaster03>	xsane exits immedietly on startup with (7.10) :: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[21:18	<karamazov>	how can i make myself an administrator?
[21:18	<erUSUL>	karamazov: editting those files directly is a Bad Idea (tm) there are many commands to do what you want adduser
[21:18	<TwinX>	karamazov; #ubuntu-tr  tıkla
[21:18	<Flare183>	karamazov: What do you mean like root?
[21:18	<Starnestommy>	karamazov: you probably need to edit /etc/sudoers or add the user to the admin group
[21:18	<kindofabuzz>	karamazov: add yourself to the admin group
[21:18	<IcemanV9>	karamazov: use sudo
[21:18	<Skapare>	LukeL: yeah ... but I decided regular Ubuntu was fine as performance goes
[21:18	<karamazov>	ok thank you
[21:19	<emorris>	﻿karamazov: add your self to the admin group
[21:19	<LukeL>	Skapare that's good to hear
[21:19	<joshua__>	how do i use Samba?? and my network works if im on vista or xp, but just ubuntu i can see the network and workgroup, but not any of the files on them.
[21:19	<Cyr4x>	GLib-ERROR **: The thread system is not yet initialized.
[21:19	<Cyr4x>	what's happening?
[21:19	<jburd>	fbc: I think hardy is a downgrade rather than an upgrade of any sort
[21:19	<bruenig>	the glib thread has not yet been initialized it appears
[21:19	<Administrator_>	kindofabuzz: is your model also WLI-CB-G54?
[21:20	<Skapare>	LukeL: it's this funny glitch I'd like to fix ... when I move the mouse, it produces a buzz (for fast moves) or clicks (for very slow moves) in the sound card output ... while playing sound actually works fine otherwise
[21:20	<fdkrew>	Kindofbuzz what card are u using?
[21:20	<evilbug>	i have a question about upgrading to 8.04 via alternative cd.i declined the "download updates while upgrading" option,but it's still telling me that it has to download stuff on the Start Upgrade window.why?

=== albertz_ is now known as albertz_K
[21:20	<IcemanV9>	joshua__: it has to be on windows side if i could remember correctly
[21:20	<Skapare>	LukeL: since 8.04 just came out I decided I'd try that before pursuing this other ways
[21:20	<kindofabuzz>	Administrator_: no, mine's a pci wireless, wrt54g, still a broadcom chipset though
[21:21	<carlos>	hey, does anyone knows a virtual drive emulator for ubuntu? like daemon tools f.e.
[21:21	<kR8ViTy>	hate to just jump in but I installed gutsy server, now am I able to use mirrors for all in the sources.list, cuz the archive.ubuntu.com is just too slow...

[21:21	<joshua__>	Carlos use Kiso
[21:21	<realcoolguy>	carlos, loopback mounting, you can do it with cds etc... i'll find a link for the instructions
[21:21	<jburd>	nvidia displays worked flawlessly with gutsy.  hardy has probably just broken all of that.

[21:21	<carlos>	thx
[21:21	<zengen>	Hi, is there any way to make a path variable recursive?  Or, do you have to add ever subdirectory?

[21:21	<zengen>	every&
[21:22	<cdm10>	Where does GVFS store the trash folder?
[21:22	<LukeL>	Skapare, I've heard that buzzing before on my computer with headphones on, I think it may just come with age
[21:22	<dystopianray>	zengen:
[21:22	<carlos>	i will use synaptic
[21:22	<dystopianray>	zengen: you need to add every subdirectory
[21:22	<cdm10>	I don't see a /.Trash folder, like the freedesktop.org spec says there should be.

[21:22	<jharkn>	!mountiso | carlos
[21:22	<ubotu>	carlos: To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename>	<mountpoint>	» or use the "gmountiso" package - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
[21:22	<realcoolguy>	oh, kiso does look nice, install it if you don't mind extra kde libraries carlos
[21:22	<LukeL>	Skapare, you could try muting all the other channels except the ones you need (like mute mic, line in, cdrom etc)
[21:22	<jason>	jburd i say huraay for heron
[21:22	<carlos>	thank you very much
[21:22	<Skapare>	LOGAN: still unknown ... I think they are hiding DVDs until they all get downloaded from the central place mirrors get them from
[21:23	<jburd>	jason: I'm a fool because your nvidia card works fine?  I have 4 machines with different nvidia graphics cards here and none of them show up except one.  Who's the dick here you or me?
[21:23	<jburd>	jason: I say heron is borked.
[21:23	<saito>	"In order to be able to play TCP/IP games over a LAN, you will need to put a reference to your own machine in your /etc/hosts file." <-- how would that exactly look in my hosts file? (my ip currently is 192.168.1.7)

[21:26	<giggsey>	I've just installed Hardy, and got two problems. My PC is randomly freezing, total freeze, can do nothing (most of them, the monitor goes black and that's it). Also, when I login, the sound doesn't play, and a grey box appears for 5 minutes
[21:26	<lakotajames_>	when i log off and leave the computer to come back later, after pressing a key to wake the monitor a white screen with a mouse appears.  I can move the mouse, but that is it. I then have to hold the power button in until the computer turns off and i have to reboot. i am still using 7.10.  Is there a reason and/or fix for this?

[21:36	<neuromancer>	hi just upgraded and was led to believe that in the latest release you could view your folders using a thumbnail view.  I can't seem to locate this option.  is it possible (this is a basic feature which should have been in form the start IMHO!)

I'm using a python script so that amarok can handle my keyboard buttons and such, but the strange thing is that if i run "python gnome_media_keys.py" in a terminal things is fine. However, if i use the Run program thing (Alt + F2) and "python gnome_media_keys.py", then python is eating all of my CPU. How come?
[21:36	<Vlet>	emorris: ahh... then maybe it's just your client prepending some utf-8 characters onto the beginning of your messages
[21:36	<roffe__>	"Ask your administrator to grant you permissions to create a share." that's what it says in the GUI for "File manager"

[21:45	<n000b>	how do i run pulseaudio?
[21:45	<ptn107>	PKsteR: when you go to System ->	Administration ->	Hardware Drivers and check the box next to your nvidia card what happens
[21:45	<daemon3>	neuromancer: So I shouldn't try to upgrade now?
[21:45	<dystopianray>	Xecuter88: i'm not sure why it would take up so much cpu then, it's very strange
[21:45	<Vlet>	Pandemic: or try ctrl-f2
[21:45	<PKsteR>	ptn107: i got a 8800gtx but the driver wont install, for some reason i have to re-inwstall them when i re boot so im forced to use low graphics mode every time
[21:45	<m_saberi>	hi
[21:45	<drivetrax>	engie:  -- there's been problems since yesterday
[21:45	<graingert>	n000b: in the terminal
[21:45	<amerio>	realcoolguy_ nop I dont think so
[21:45	<neuromancer>	﻿daemon3: better than yesterday, you should be ok

[21:46	<graingert>	pulseaudio -k
[21:46	<neuromancer>	﻿n000b: try... sudo lshw
[21:46	<graingert>	not sure of spelling
[21:46	<andycaass>	jbur2: i want to mount a iso, should i mount it as a cd rom or something?
[21:46	<graingert>	tab complete
[21:46	<Chillum>	FooAtari: The mesage was that the directory did not exist!
[21:46	<daemon3>	Also, I got a Kubuntu "alternate" iso image and burned it to a disk.  However, I don't see an "upgrade" option.  Yes, my system is fully updated.
[21:46	<realcoolguy_>	amerio, well connect your laptop with a wire to the router (have you ever used the wireless before on that router?) some make you enable it, and set the IP pool
[21:46	<drivetrax>	engie:  -- why, i tried to apt-get a file, and it took quiet a while before it started
[21:46	<PKsteR>	ptn107: it say that they are anabled and that i need to restart but when i do i have to do it again.
[21:46	<jbur2>	andycaass: sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 foobar.iso /mnt/
[21:46	<graingert>	n000b: remermber pulseaudio -D to renalable
[21:46	<amerio>	realcoolguy_ yeah when I had gutsy it used to work , when I made a fresh install for hardy stopped working
[21:47	<realcoolguy_>	amerio: another thing you might want to look at first, is click the littler wireless icon, and does it list the access points you see?
[21:47	<Stiny>	Vlet: I gues Linux isn't for me. Maybe because I can't solve simple problems. :)
[21:47	<Xecuter88>	anyone else know? having a strange problem. I'm using a python script so that amarok can handle my keyboard buttons and such, but the strange thing is that if i run "python gnome_media_keys.py" in a terminal things is fine. However, if i use the Run program thing (Alt + F2) and "python gnome_media_keys.py", then python is eating all of my CPU. How come?
[21:47	<amerio>	realcoolguy_ nop its not acitvated at all , wireless isnt working
[21:47	<ptn107>	PKsteR: pop open synaptic and see if the nvidia-glx-new package and nvidia-kernel-common packages are installed
[21:47	<chubs730>	andycaass: that command works wonderfully, but gmountiso is also in the repositories if you want something graphical
[21:47	<Dgro>	What's wrong repositories/upgrade

[21:47	<n000b>	graingert can we talk one on one
[21:48	<realcoolguy_>	amerio: oh, i think it was something about restricted drivers when i installed ubuntu, it found the atheros drivers and put them in
[21:48	<ravi>	testing
[21:48	<n000b>	graingert:
[21:48	<andycaass>	hellonull: thanks, chubs730: thanks
[21:48	<PKsteR>	ptn107: ok gimmi a minuite and thhanks for the help btw
[21:48	<amerio>	realcoolguy_ atheros driver in restricted drivers is enabled and in use
[21:48	<graingert>	n000b: no keep in room
[21:48	<ptn107>	PKsteR: no prob
[21:48	<Vlet>	Stiny: Just remember that probably 99.9999% of linux users figured it out using a combination of google, reading documentation, books, and chatrooms like this... just takes time
[21:48	<graingert>	n000b: I gtg now so good luck!

[21:57	<gpled>	thought bittorents solved the load problem years ago
[21:57	<ibleed>	i installed a gnome icon theme.  despite having installed it all icons changed except for folder icons.  the folder icons instead of switching went to "standard gnome" icons.  how can i fix ?

[21:57	<tyranos>	where can i setup my notebook special keys plz help
[21:57	<cl>	lindo, the bigger probl is that you can't mount your windows drive though.
[21:57	<dystopianray>	gpled: apt doesn't work over bittorrent though
[21:57	<amenado>	gpled->	i already told you the servers are extremely busy, just be patient
[21:57	<dystopianray>	sarah_bear: are you using hardy?
[21:57	<lindo>	hmm
[21:57	<drivetrax>	lindo:  Wubi is a Loop Mounted Ubuntu.  Not going to change Partitions.. it can be mounted with LVM..

[21:58	<ibleed>	thanks pen
[21:58	<ptn107>	PKsteR: check your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file,   in the section under 'Device'  the Driver should be "nvidia"; heres my xorg.conf file for reference http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64423/
[21:58	<chubs730>	lindo: you can also install ubuntu and not change the mbr, and use a usb boot stick
[21:58	<drivetrax>	lindo:  unetbootin - is a network via internet install that will partition and make MBR
[21:58	<lindo>	gotcha, and you'd consider that preferable to a boot cd or some such?
[21:58	<dystopianray>	sarah_bear: make sure you have this packaged installed: libk3b2-mp3
[21:58	<|jess|>	drivetrax: I already have 2 distros and wanted to add ubuntu.
[21:58	<amenado>	needcdrom->	the server side may be busy

[21:59	<adiabatic>	cl: did the machine run Ubuntu OK after the installer finished, though?
[21:59	<cl>	GNUtoo, hello
[21:59	<sarah_bear>	I already have that installed dystopianray
[21:59	<lindo>	Thanks chubs, drivetrax, I'll look into both
[21:59	<sarah_bear>	anything else i need?
[21:59	<DaaT>	also, when booting from hardy's CD, it gets to the first screen (after choosing install), the language select screen, but can't advance. Cursor moves but doesn't clic, keyboard navigation doesn't work as well. It's the same thing when booting into 8.04 after updating from 7.10, using the latest kernel version
[21:59	<ceil420>	needcdrom, when i got that message, i had broken packages. the error message should have given you a directory to some logs; look at the latter part of those logs and see what packages are causing the problem, and remove them manually
[21:59	<csais>	what do you mean with trolling?
[21:59	<cl>	adiabatic, very slow. i put another 256MB in and it was much better.
[21:59	<dystopianray>	sarah_bear: what problem are you having with k3b then?
[21:59	<strtok>	Anyone have an issue with 8.04's titlebars turning purple/rainbow every once in a while? They correct themselves if you click on the window
[21:59	<cl>	adiabatic, i wouldn't recommend it.
[21:59	<Jeah>	Can anyone help me with a weird window manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy?
[21:59	<gpled>	wa hoo, look at it fly
[21:59	<|jess|>	drivetrax: I did choose to install the Ubuntu bootloader in the same partition as the installation because I didn't want ubuntu to change my grub setup
[21:59	<ptn107>	strtok: yes
[21:59	<cl>	adiabatic, even WinXP was faster
[21:59	<ChrisVP>	I'm trying to install some drivers, and getting the message that us.archives.ubuntu.com isn't resolving.  Is that standard behavior?  Will it be resolved soon?
[21:59	<CyberCod>	didja all hear about the new Apple product?  its just like the iPhone, except that they gave it an honest name... its called the iBroken
[21:59	<needcdrom>	ceil420: thank you thank you! that's the kind of thing I needed to know
[22:00	<drivetrax>	I found that using a certain ATI Video card.. the drivers were better with the Ubuntu OS.. I just do not have Catalyst.. and video tweaks
[22:00	<amenado>	Daat do you have an existing 7.10 running? would you like to try and boot the downloaded 8.04 iso from hd?
[22:00	<dystopianray>	amenado: of course he's not trolling, he wants to know where his windows partition is mounted within ubuntu
[22:00	<strtok>	ptn107: any idea what causes it?
[22:00	<gpled>	central control of downloads is a bad idea
[22:00	<noodlesgc>	ChrisVP server is overloaded

[22:00	<|jess|>	drivetrax: But now, I can't reboot one of the old distros... :-(
[22:00	<ceil420>	strtok, 8.04 Ubuntu, Kubuntu, or Xubuntu?

[22:00	<ChrisVP>	noodlesgc: alright, thanks
[22:00	<ceil420>	strtok, i blame Gnome <_<
[22:00	<DaaT>	amenado, i had 7.10, but updated to 8.04 yesterday :P that's when the problems started
[22:00	<ptn107>	strtok: i thought maybe my binary nvidia drivers. but even without them it still happens (even on my laptop)
[22:00	<giggsey>	Is there anyway to stop pulseaudio crashing when I log into gdm?
[22:00	<sarah_bear>	hmm dystopianray i can't play a mp3 using totem movie player
[22:00	<strtok>	ceil420: it felt like a compiz feature
[22:00	<megatog615>	anyone wanna tell me why there are no sound drivers?
[22:00	<drivetrax>	|jess|:  -- dual booting two linux..then
[22:00	<sarah_bear>	says something about suitable codec?
[22:00	<amenado>	DaaT can you reboot back to 7.10?
[22:00	<ceil420>	strtok, did you try disabling compiz? :o
[22:00	<pharoh>	hey ya'll.is the new ubuntu release stable?as in is it safe for one to upgrade now,who's tried it so far?
[22:01	<n000b>	ive got a window thats frozen and wont close. what should i do? is there a linux equivalent of control alt delete?
[22:01	<PhoenixP3K>	noodlesgc, yeah it took all night to ugrade for me, and i'm a bit dissapointed
[22:01	<xkcdr0ckz>	drivetrax: dunno if this is correct (got it from xorg.conf file)  -->	"ATI Technologies Inc M10 NT [FireGL Mobility T2]"
[22:01	<CyberCod>	I can't get this thing to show anything more than 800x600 using the nvidia-glx-new drivers
[22:01	<strtok>	ceil420: i love it too much to disable it
[22:01	<dystopianray>	sarah_bear: is this a a new problem or the same you were describing earlier?
[22:01	<GreenFuze>	Hey everybody! Can anyone help me with a problem I got in the Hardy upgrade - my computer won't start....
[22:01	<DaaT>	amenado, the only options at boot i have are 8.04 (with new and previous kernel)
[22:01	<drivetrax>	xkcdr0ckz:  You may need the Mesa driver
[22:01	<ceil420>	pharoh, it's been officially released, if that's what you mean. i wouldn't necessarily call ubuntu "stable" *cough*
[22:01	<daedra>	!w32codecs
[22:01	<ubotu>	The Win32 codecs are available from the Medibuntu repositories (see « /msg ubotu medibuntu »), and for releases prior to Gutsy, also at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeveasPackages
[22:01	<Mulder>	compiz wont even work with open source radeon driver now but it will with fglrx (oh the irony).
[22:01	<ceil420>	strtok, then live with it :p or figure out how to change it
[22:01	<meoblast>	how do i upgrade Ubuntu from Gutsy to Hardy throught a CD.... my bios does not boot my only working CD Drive so i need to do it from my already installed Gutsy
[22:01	<|jess|>	drivetrax: yes. Three linux
[22:01	<amenado>	Daat previous kernel? as in previous 7.10 ?
[22:01	<ceil420>	i prefer minimalism to glitz and glitter
[22:01	<noodlesgc>	PhoenixP3K i cant even get to the "download packages" stage
[22:01	<meoblast001>	is anyone here?
[22:01	<strtok>	ceil420: i can totally live with it - just checking if anyone knows what it is
[22:01	<sarah_bear>	its the sameone, but i think i fixed it dystopianray b installed GStreamer plugins
[22:01	<n000b>	ive got a window thats frozen and wont close. what should i do? is there a linux equivalent of control alt delete?
[22:02	<strtok>	ceil420: i don't like compiz for the glitz/glitter, it has functional features
[22:02	<drivetrax>	Mulder:  it will.. it works with the Mesa driver, and some restricted ATI drivers
[22:02	<CyberCod>	n000b you can hit alt+f2 and then type in xkill and hit enter.... then the next thing you click on will die
[22:02	<noodlesgc>	n000b ctrl+alt+backspace
[22:02	<ceil420>	n000b, killall <program name>
[22:02	<pharoh>	ceil420: i know.have you tried it?
[22:02	<strtok>	ceil420: window snapping, the "wall" feature, etc
[22:02	<xkcdr0ckz>	drivetrax: where can i get the "Mesa" driver?
[22:02	<DaaT>	amenado, believe so. It's... 2.24 I think (trying to recall from memory) and new is 2.26, or something. You probably know it better than I do :)
[22:02	<meoblast>	how do i upgrade Ubuntu from Gutsy to Hardy throught a CD.... my bios does not boot my only working CD Drive so i need to do it from my already installed Gutsy ??
[22:02	<ompaul>	n000b, xkill in a new terminal and then click on the offending program
[22:02	<PhoenixP3K>	meoblast001, are you the same as meoblast?
[22:02	<jPratt>	dpkg: requested operation requires superuser privilege what the hell does that mean
[22:02	<dystopianray>	n000b: press 'alt+f2' then type 'xkill', then click on the application you want to kill
[22:02	<ceil420>	pharoh, tried compiz? my computer can't use it
[22:02	<Starnestommy>	jPratt: put sudo before the command
[22:02	<jPratt>	KK

[22:02	<Nevstah>	hey everyone, any reason why i should be getting slow LAN speed since 8.04 upgrade? i get about 800KB/s up / 1MB/s down :(
[22:02	<amenado>	DaaT then try to boot from the previous and we can probably load the new 8.04 from hard disk
[22:02	<ptn107>	meoblast: correct, download and burn the alternate  cd and stick it in while running gutsy
[22:02	<Mulder>	drivetrax, stock install picked up the 'ati' driver from xorg, and it refused to enable desktop effects with that despite xorg logs saying aiglx was enabled

[22:03	<daedra>	the link doesn't help for 8.04

[22:03	<Starnestommy>	RobinReborn: put "sudo" before that command
[22:03	<Mulder>	drivetrax, hmmm didnt it used to work with stock ati driver?
[22:03	<DaaT>	amenado, will do. How do I go about booting the ISO from HDD?
[22:03	<PhoenixP3K>	meoblast, oh i see
[22:03	<strtok>	ceil420: "desktop wall"
[22:03	<meoblast>	ptn107: do i need alternate, i have the regular installer
[22:03	<megatog615>	Anyone here use 64-bit?
[22:03	<Richard>	RobinReborn: run sudo dpkg --configure -a
[22:03	<ceil420>	strtok, you mean the wallpaper?
[22:04	<RobinReborn>	thanks Richard!
[22:04	<ubutom>	meoblast: so whats the sense in keeping a broken drive in your machine?
[22:04	<pharoh>	ceil420: ah.but since i'm still a newbie(one en a half months now) guess i'll stick to 7.10 til i learn more:)
[22:04	<drivetrax>	Mulder:  -- I dunno, I just got 7.10, and had this difficulty, and #Compiz-Fusion helped me run it down
[22:04	<ptn107>	meoblast: i think you need the ubuntu-8.04-alternate-$ARCH.iso
[22:04	<strtok>	ceil420: no, "desktop wall" - it's an addon for virtual desktops
[22:04	<meoblast>	ubutom: too poor to buy a new one
[22:04	<strtok>	makes it easy to drag windows between virtual desktops
[22:04	<Jeah>	Can anybody help me with a weird window manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy?  Xfce4-terminal is opening without window decorations.  It has the right shape, but instead of the title bar, frame, close button, etc it is just solid black.  I can click where the buttons should be and they work, but they're not visible.  Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  I just tried re-downloading and re
[22:04	<ubutom>	meoblast: and how will it be able to access a cdrom you have?
[22:04	<PhoenixP3K>	Can anyone confirm that there is transparency all around the windows that are inactive in Hardy?
[22:04	<ceil420>	strtok, i can do that easily enough with my Enlightenment window manager :)
[22:04	<meoblast>	ubutom: i just cant BOOT from it
=== Richard is now known as delphi
[22:04	<meoblast>	i have external
[22:05	<amenado>	DaaT you have to mount the iso, then copy it over to a ext2 partition ext2 okay not ext3 and then put an entry on exisisting menu.lst for the new 8.04
[22:05	<LebLinux>	hello, just upgraded to Hardy, and I noticed in Grub there is both kernels the 2.6.24 (default) and 2.6.22 any ideas why?
[22:05	<drivetrax>	Many people are in here.. that might need to be in #compiz-Fusion.. with their Video card driver issues
[22:05	<meoblast>	ptn107: that sux
[22:05	<ptn107>	LebLinux: it keeps your old one just in case, though you can remove it if you want
[22:05	<Mulder>	the other issue i've experienced which was a major bummer, was the gnome calendar hangs the gnome environment for me.
[22:05	<amenado>	PhoenixP3K->	what is that? transparency meaning i cant see it?
[22:05	<LebLinux>	ptn107: alright thank you.
[22:05	<drivetrax>	Mulder:  -- gnome is at their site
[22:06	<DaaT>	amenado, i'll look into it. But i have to say, when i boot into 7.10, there are no taskbars (top and bottom). Happened after yesterday's update
[22:06	<NicDumZ>	Hi ! :) Yet another one of these hardy users without _any_ sound since upgrade. Google for vlc error outputs did not help; vlc-plugin-pulse _is_ installed. Any common hardy-sound FAQ / known issues page maybe ?
[22:06	<romanotp>	How can I remove the old version of the kernel???
[22:06	<meoblast>	i guess im f*cked
[22:06	<ceil420>	Mulder, if all you need is to look at a basic calender, you can just type "cal" on the command line to see one
[22:06	<arooni>	whats the name of a screenshot utility
[22:06	<arooni>	for ubuntu
[22:06	<PhoenixP3K>	amenado, well the borders become translucent. before it was only the top, but now it's all around the windows border
[22:06	<amenado>	DaaT->	oh well, you tried to upgrade during the busiest period, most likely it did not complete
[22:06	<jbur2>	romanotp: sudo vim /boot/grub/menu.list    Backup this file before editing this one.
[22:07	<DaaT>	amenado, yay :)
[22:07	<drivetrax>	DaaT:  did you click on the panel for the virtual desktops.. top right.
[22:07	<nucco>	arooni just push the "prt scr" button
[22:07	<amenado>	PhoenixP3K->	i dont notice it, it may be really transparent that it is hard to see
[22:07	<corbett>	maxtor mini III 100 gb                 http://paste.ubuntu.com/8002/
[22:07	<ptn107>	romanotp: sudo apt-get remove --purge --auto-remove linux-image-$(uname -r)
[22:07	<Mulder>	ceil420, it's not that. i sometimes accidentally click on calendar since it's next to logout icon, and if do that then i need to use ctrl alt del or ctrl alt backspace to bring down the system
[22:07	<DaaT>	drivetrax, nope. It happens as soon as it shows the desktop, without any user action
[22:07	<PhoenixP3K>	amenado, do you have your desktop effects on normal or extra?
[22:07	<ceil420>	Mulder, i recommend taking the calender off your panel if it's crashing X >_>
[22:08	<RobinReborn>	does anybody have any idea why I see no progress when I am download package files for an update?
[22:08	<nucco>	ptn107: are you aware that that will remove the currently running kernel?
[22:08	<ptn107>	nucco: oh shi ya
[22:08	<drivetrax>	DaaT:  All I could say is that either gnome is not right, or the desktop is still in a past session
[22:08	<Starnestommy>	RobinReborn: a lot of the servers are overloaded
[22:08	<lifesf>	hi; i have gotten rid of gutsy and have now installed hardy server but i get an error while [sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop]
[22:08	<Nevstah>	any reason why i should be getting slow LAN speed since 8.04 upgrade? i get about 800KB/s up / 1MB/s down :(  or how i can diagnose?
[22:08	<cl>	!RobinReborn: servers are getting hammered. Try another source
[22:08	<DaaT>	drivetrax, looks like it, yes
[22:08	<Mulder>	ceil420, yeah i might have to do that. guess i'll have to substitute with something like screenlets instead :S
[22:08	<ptn107>	romanotp: scratch that replace $(uname -r) with the one you want to remove
[22:09	<amenado>	PhoenixP3K->	normal
[22:09	<ceil420>	Mulder, the CLI's "cal" is good enough for me :p
[22:09	<nucco>	ptn107: probably best to just leave it there. the newest one is usually even the default...
[22:09	<joshua__>	how do i find shared folders?
[22:09	<DaaT>	amenado and drivetrax, thanks for the help. I'll keep trying to install from CD, though with it not accepting any user commands... *crosses fingers*
[22:09	<romanotp>	ptn107:  thanx
[22:09	<drivetrax>	DaaT:  I know, when I click the panel with my 4 virtual tops.. all task/panel applet bars go away
[22:09	<Vlet>	Anyone know how to have samba auth against pam or kerberos instead of samba's built-in password db?

[22:09	<PhoenixP3K>	amenado, last question, do you have the Human theme on?
[22:09	<Theo_>	I have two harddrives. I can't boot into windows after installing ubuntu on the second harddrive. I can look inside the windows partition from ubuntu and see that everything is there. How do I get windows to boot?

[22:09	<Steve^>	Does the amd64 version support 32 bit apps? Am I going to have compatibility issues?

[22:10	<amenado>	PhoenixP3K->	what indicator can i see to tell me it is that?  what clue?

[22:10	<joshua__>	lots work but it is much more work
[22:10	<Steve^>	jbur2, so I should just go with i386?

[22:10	<Theo_>	i chaned the boot sequence to boot from the windows harddrive and it doesnt work
[22:10	<psych>	is there a bug on gnome keyboard tool (hardy) ??
[22:10	<jbur2>	Steve^, I'd say go with amd64.
[22:10	<amenado>	PhoenixP3K->	from appearance preferences, i have human clearlooks
[22:10	<arcsky>	none installed ubuntu from a usbstick?
[22:11	<xb3rt>	whats the best iso burner for ubunutu that can do a .uif and .iso?
[22:11	<chubs730>	nevstah: i'm not positive as to why that would be, but there seems to be a few bugs in the networking infrastructure for 8.04, so maybe file a bug report and see if updates don't fix the issue

They stop after 2 seconds and there's no sound, something I remember back from dapper. I've followed the wiki page on it (under !flash). I've install alsa-oss and set the firefoxrc. I've install libflash-mozplugin. It's all come to naught, and I'm at a loss as what to do next.... Also, once a flash video does
[22:12	<Stormx2>	 play (which requires absolutely no other app using the sound card when firefox is started AND when the video plays) I have to restart firefox afterwards to be able to use other sound-producing apps. Help! :)
[22:12	<joshua__>	you need to get 32 bit libraries for them
[22:12	<leo_rockw>	how can i force apt not to update a package?

[22:12	<hwilde>	arcsky, sry that's all i've got - but it is official so it should work
[22:12	<joshua__>	you can usually find them, but they are more work to install
[22:12	<hwilde>	amenado, no share = no support :)
[22:12	<amenado>	hwilde nothing special really, i just added it myself
[22:12	<Nevstah>	chubs730: how do i check if i'm using right drivers?
[22:12	<amenado>	hwilde no problem i dont need support.. :P
[22:12	<joshua__>	ubuntu only keeps 64bit libraries you have to manually enter 32bit
[22:12	<chubs730>	steve: i'm on 64bit and i run plenty of 32bit apps, it's pain free for the most part

[22:13	<mo3>	hi all
[22:13	<PhoenixP3K>	amenado, oh ok - i don't know why mine looks strange. it's different from when I had Gusty on. I think i'll try re0installing compiz
[22:13	<joshua__>	chubs is right, they can be quite pain free or a big pain, depends what you're looking for
[22:13	<GreenFuze>	Hey, I'm kinda really stuck here after installing hardy, Can anyone help me here???
[22:13	<MRutter>	hi, I'm getting this audio error when running a game called spring: ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
[22:13	<daemon3>	For some reason, my update manager (now it's apitutude) doesn't say I need to upgrade.  What could be the problem?
[22:13	<MRutter>	open /dev/[sound/]dsp: Device or resource busy
[22:13	<GreenFuze>	Thanks!
[22:13	<Steve^>	chubs730, which areas aren't ok? Is development work fine?
[22:13	<hwilde>	!ask | GreenFuze
[22:13	<ubotu>	GreenFuze: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[22:13	<lifesf>	what is the ubuntu server channel name?
[22:13	<hwilde>	!alsa | MRutter
[22:13	<ubotu>	MRutter: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[22:13	<PhoenixP3K>	Does anyone else have the translucent border issue after upgrading?
[22:13	<Bubble_tea>	Can i have two user with english for one and chinese for another user 'language'?\
[22:14	<hwilde>	Bubble_tea, yes language is set by profile
[22:14	<amenado>	Bubble_tea->	why not? different locales ?
[22:14	<Starnestommy>	lifesf: #ubuntu-server, but this channel also supports it
[22:14	<psych>	is there a bug on gnome keyboard tool (hardy) ??
[22:14	<plik>	hwilde: scp -r is recursicve, but iof you're not getting .files transfered it's prolly coz of your * wildcard  - try rsync -avz on the directory instead
[22:14	<chubs730>	nevstah: you'd have to check your /etc/network/interfaces
[22:14	<instantsoup>	hello there.
[22:14	<MRutter>	hwilde: lol, must be a common problem to have a bot set up for that :P
[22:14	<leo_rockw>	how can i force apt not to update a package?
[22:14	<leo_rockw>	hello instantsoup
[22:14	<Bubble_tea>	amenado, hwilde how would i do this?
[22:14	<hwilde>	MRutter, yep but that's good news too bc there is a common fix
[22:14	<joshua__>	does anyone know where they moved "Shared Folders" to? it was previously in System, Administration
[22:15	<chubs730>	steve: there are only a few applications that just don't run, the only thing i can think of is blender, but with work you can still install blender
[22:15	<daedra>	sn is the symlinking program right?
[22:15	<Starnestommy>	daedra: ln -s
[22:15	<lifesf>	ok... well... i just need help because i have no idea why [sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop] does not work on fresh install of ubuntu server hardy
[22:15	<hwilde>	Bubble_tea, it's probably an option in System ->	Admin ->	Language Support
[22:15	<noodlesgc>	FINALLY!! ok usefull INFO!! anyone upgrading using do-release-upgrade you MUST use the "-m desktop" switch
[22:15	<Bubble_tea>	amenado, hwilde I checked and install Chinese supported Langauges however .
[22:15	<daedra>	Starnestommy: ahh ok
[22:15	<Steve^>	chubs730, that's no problem, I won't be using blender
[22:15	<Wirta->	hey is there somekind of force close option in ubuntu? my wine configuration window freezed
[22:15	<weefeller>	!ndiswrapper
[22:15	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[22:15	<jbur2>	noodlesgc: Why?
[22:15]  * test3r is getting nice, proper speed off the torrent right now. Hooray for the Desktop "LiveCD" for allowing me to test my hardware beFORE my *buntu dies! TY again guys for such a proper job. Can't wait to try the newest.
[22:15	<Bubble_tea>	amenado, hwilde it only allow one default language for user..
[22:16	<chubs730>	if anyone else is aware of problems (joshua?) for specific apps do speak up
[22:16	<hwilde>	plik, ok I didn't think to use rsync duhh
[22:16	<ravi_>	I have a UPS. Ubuntu displays the remaining charge correctly, but does not hibernate at the set critical point. I have checked the settings and they are OK. What could be the problem? This happens in Gutsy, Hardy as well.
[22:16	<joshua__>	steve i would definitly say go 64 if you are doing development work, i think you can handle installing a couple libraries
[22:16	<instantsoup>	i have a weird problem with pidgin. When i try to add an icq account it tells me the screen name must start with a letter/must be an email.  But it should be the icq number, right? And it shows the AIM symbol in the account manager
[22:16	<noodlesgc>	jbur2 because otherwise it will turn you into a server
[22:16	<Starnestommy>	Wirta-: hit alt+f2, enter "xkill", then click on the frozen window
[22:16	<Nevstah>	chubs730: drivers arent shown in /etc/network/interfaces? just IP settings?
[22:16	<hwilde>	Bubble_tea, have you made the three user accounts?
[22:16	<noodlesgc>	jbur2 or just will not work
[22:16	<amenado>	Bubble_tea->	i have to look around, since i dont use foreign chars.. look into SCMI perhaps
[22:16	<Steve^>	joshua__, I hope so! :)   thanks
[22:16	<brakkvatn>	instantsoup: Try choosing the green flower again :)
[22:16	<Bubble_tea>	hwilde i made 2
[22:16	<hwilde>	Bubble_tea, log in as the other one and change the language to Chinese
[22:16	<joshua__>	i had some issue with epsxe but i got it working after about 20 minutes
[22:16	<giggsey>	Is there anyway to stop audiopulse crashing when I log into gdm?
[22:16	<plik>	hwilde: much easier - just take note of the trailing  / on source dir
[22:16	<Wirta->	thanks Starnestommy
[22:16	<amenado>	Bubble_tea->	maybe SCIM..
[22:17	<nickrober>	anyone having scratchy sound problems?
[22:17	<instantsoup>	brakkvatn nope not that simple
[22:17	<arthur>	Does anyone successfully use Remote Desktop with Ubuntu 8.04?
[22:17	<brakkvatn>	instantsoup: What happens when you select it?
[22:17	<ToM-x>	Who was it who asked about sharing folders?
[22:17	<yaroslav>	this is madness but this is not sparta.. even european servers are slow as hell
[22:17	<EruditeHermit>	hey, I tried upgrading to hardy, but the upgrade failed and when I try to login, I get a brown background. However, I am able to login via console. When I login with console, and try to do apt-get upgrade or apt-get -f install it says that dpkg-divert rename involves overwriting /sbin/depmod with different file, not allowed.
[22:17	<nonewmsgs>	nickrober i had that trouble with builtin sound cards
[22:18	<alastair_>	errr
[22:18	<nonewmsgs>	nickrober regardless of OS
[22:18	<alastair_>	bug reporting?
[22:18	<jms1989>	The stupid ubuntu servers need to speed up. I need to download some packages.
[22:18	<chubs730>	nevstah: you're right, sorry, i usually just compare the outputs of lsmod and lspci to make sure the correct drivers are in use
[22:18	<nickrober>	nonewmsgs: oh well some people here including myself were having a scratchy sound problem in 8.04 and i just found the fix
[22:18	<Jeah>	Can anybody help me with a weird window manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy?  Xfce4-terminal is opening without window decorations.  It has the right shape, but instead of the title bar, frame, close button, etc it is just solid black.  I can click where the buttons should be and they work, but they're not visible.  Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  Compositing is off.  I tried re-do
[22:18	<instantsoup>	like i said, i add or modify the account, choose icq and add everything, then i save it and it shows the account in the account manager as ICQ but with the AIM symbol next to it
[22:18	<nonewmsgs>	nickrober: sweet :)
[22:18	<daemon3>	Yesterday I tried to install Hardy, but I quit a little after I started downloading the packages.  No actual installs took place.  Now my update manager doesn't say I need to upgrade.  I tried apt-get clean, aptitude clearn, apt-get autoclean, and aptitude autoclean, but I still get the same resutls.  Why do you think this is?
[22:18	<dubby>	hey anyone does hardy have a samba configuration gui?
[22:18	<instantsoup>	and won't enable it
[22:18	<_ditoa>	im installing hardy on my brand new dell :D
[22:19	<_ditoa>	cant wait!
[22:19	<danage>	dubby: nautilus
[22:19	<chubs730>	nevstah: the actual location of them escapes me at the moment though
[22:19	<DanaG>	Oh hey, anybody know why Gnome Power Manager no longer offers battery brightness control?
[22:19	<noodlesgc>	_ditoa which model?
[22:19	<Scunizi>	anyone using Gizmo? if so which version.. the .deb or the binary tarball?  (Gutsy/Hardy)
[22:19	<corbett>	anyone got any tips on how to get my maxtor mini 111 external hard drive working on ubuntu - http://paste.ubuntu.com/8002/
[22:19	<Pilha>	hello world
[22:19	<_ditoa>	noodlesgc: i bought an inspiron 530N, it came with Ubuntu 7.10
[22:19	<yaroslav>	BTW whats the deal with Gnome using Mono-built (!?) stuff full-on?
[22:19	<_boto>	is there a gui front-end for gprof results file?
[22:19	<ToM-x>	dubby: sudo apt-get install system-config-samba
[22:19	<_ditoa>	only got it this afternoon :)
[22:19	<brakkvatn>	instantsoup: Sorry, I can't help you. Try asking over at #pidgin , they're usually friendly.
[22:20	<instantsoup>	alright, thanks
[22:20	<noodlesgc>	_ditoa cool, i bought my dell a while ago, an inspiron 1420n with 7.04
[22:20	<Zacaa>	good evening :)
[22:20	<_ditoa>	cool
[22:20	<_ditoa>	i am SO impressed with ubuntu
[22:20	<Pilha>	ppl, what's the file I edit to change grub's boot order?
[22:20	<jbur2>	noodlesgc: broadcom?
[22:20	<Pilha>	can't seem to remember that
[22:20	<_ditoa>	although the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 killed it :(
[22:20	<brakkvatn>	Who utters that word?
[22:20	<noodlesgc>	jbur2 no, intel 3945 abg
[22:20	<doug2266778822>	how do i make it where i can watch protected DvD's on my computer? i get an error message when i try toAn error occurred. Could not read from resource
[22:20	<brakkvatn>	br**dcom
[22:20	<nuSharper>	hi there. is there any diff between installing Ubuntu from the LiveDVD or the LiveCD? i mean, i know the DVD has more software, but is that extra software installed by default?
[22:20	<cardstroker>	how do i stop ubuntu from trying to connect for updates that it cannot connect to?
[22:20	<_ditoa>	there seems to be a bug as the hdd controller is set to IDE by default but i had to change it to RAID
[22:21	<chubs730>	boto: google says xgprof
[22:21	<ToM-x>	Pilha: sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
[22:21	<daemon3>	My update manager doesn't tell me I need to upgrade.  Is anyone else having this problem?
[22:21	<jbur2>	noodlesgc: lucky
[22:21	<Pilha>	ok, menu.lst
[22:21	<_boto>	oh thanks a lot chubs730
[22:21	<kindofabuzz>	woot bcm wireless in Hardy!
[22:21	<|DuReX|>	daemon3: try: apt-get update
[22:21	<noodlesgc>	jbur2 yes it works quite well
[22:21	<Pilha>	ToM, thx
[22:21	<ToM-x>	No problem :)
[22:21	<ditoa>	noodlesgc: switched back to my main account :)
[22:22	<MrObvious>	!flash
[22:22	<ubotu>	To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash (for !Dapper and !Edgy, a recent version is available in !backports) - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[22:22	<Nevstah>	chubs730: thanks
[22:22	<ditoa>	but otherwise ubuntu is superb
[22:22	<drivetrax>	remember Hardy is not an update,, it is an Upgrade
[22:22	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 try sudo update-manager -d
[22:22	<jbur2>	I digress.  Hardy is a clean install.
[22:22	<Scunizi>	nuSharper: the DVD has ubutnu, kubuntu, xubuntu and related packages.. but not any more than what you would normally get if picking one of the versions and downloading the livecd
[22:22	<daemon3>	|DuReX|: I did about 90 times.  I tried apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, apt-get dist upgrade, and combinations with aptitude.  I even tried apt-get/aptitude clean/autoclean.
[22:22	<ravi_>	Is the kernel clocksource (tsc/hpet) problem solved in hardy?
[22:23	<Jeah>	daemon3: Are you talking about security/recommended updates or the upgrade to Hardy?  It won't pop up a notification icon for the distro upgrade, you'll see that if you open update manager manually.  At the top it should say that a new version is available and give you the option of upgrading.
[22:23	<cardstroker>	I'm a newby  and need some help.  right now at the command line it keeps trying to update and cannot connect, how do i stop it?
[22:23	<daemon3>	drivetrax: I know.  I make a mistake of using them interchangeably.
[22:23	<b33r_>	where is iced tea cache directory location?
[22:23	<hwilde>	cardstroker, ctrl+c
[22:23	<mistapapa>	hi all...
[22:23	<daemon3>	noodlesgc: What would the -d command do?
[22:23	<hwilde>	b33r_, sudo updatedb;   locate "iced tea"
[22:23	<cardstroker>	ctrl-c, thank you.
[22:23	<ruewan>	hello
[22:23	<nuSharper>	Scunizi: thx!
[22:23	<ToM-x>	cardstroke, elaborate.
[22:23	<ruewan>	i think hardy heron is trying to kill my hard drive
[22:23	<drivetrax>	I found on the Ubuntu Website about where/how to get 8.04.. But there are no documentations pages on their website
[22:23	<lewench>	Anyone know in CompizConfig what the plugin is for the shadow color outside the window? For some reason mine is hot pink, it was not like that before patch =)
[22:23	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 check for a new dist
[22:23	<DELU>	hi where is Grub by BT3
[22:23	<gnuskool>	external monitor resolution is still an issue, i see, mine is intel 855,

[22:24	<mistapapa>	my question: how can i run a shell skript at startup and wake up from hibernate that requires root... i need this to get my wlan up and running: sudo ifdown eth1 sudo ifup eth1
[22:24	<crimsun>	ruewan: using Firefox 3.0b5?
[22:24	<daemon3>	Jeah: I'm talking about upgrading to hardy.  I know it won't pop up a notification Icon.  I go into "Update Manager" and, even though I have Gutsy, it says that my system is up-to-date.
[22:24	<meoblast001>	my update manager's upgrade button is taking too long to bring up the update wizard and apt-get dist-upgrade isnt working, what do i do?
[22:24	<hwilde>	ruewan, type "top"  then hit capital C    that will show you the processes running sorted by cpu.
[22:24	<b33r_>	hwilde, it didn't show anything :/
[22:24	<mohbana>	hey guys, why aren't there any themes after i've installed emerald?
[22:24	<_manny>	Anyone successfully compile Apache 1.3.41 on Ubuntu Server 7.10?
[22:24	<noodlesgc>	ruewan it could be you tracker deamon indexing your HD

[22:25	<ruewan>	how do i kill the deamon
[22:25	<daemon3>	noodlesgc: I did that, too (check for a new dist)
[22:25	<chubs730>	daemon3: look a little above that, it should say a new distribution is available

[22:25	<foosh>	hello everyone
[22:25	<ToM-x>	Hey
[22:25	<hwilde>	daemon3, you have to follow the link from ubotu
[22:25	<hwilde>	!upgrade | daemon3
[22:25	<ubotu>	daemon3: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[22:25	<mohbana>	why question is before i would get the themes automatically now where have they gone? this is a new instlal
[22:25	<foosh>	i have a partition that i can't quit get to load right
[22:25	<mistapapa>	how can i run a shell skript at startup and wake up from hibernate that requires root...??? i need this to get my wlan up and running: sudo ifdown eth1 sudo ifup eth1
[22:25	<drivetrax>	Skipping versions is not advised and can cause a lot of damage to your installation.
[22:25	<ravi_>	daemon3,  check the "Updates" tab in Software Sources system settings
[22:25	<nuSharper>	another question, a given program that, when installed in Ubuntu, works out of the box without the need of extra configuration (due to codecs, let's say), would also work straight after the installation in Xubuntu?
[22:25	<lunartear>	i have public key access working from user_x@host1 to userx@host2, but using the same public key on user_y@host2  goes directly to password auth, The key is silently failing for user_y?
[22:25	<crimsun>	graingert: install padevchooser
[22:25	<daemon3>	ubotu2: I've followed those directions.
[22:26	<hwilde>	mistapapa, pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file please
[22:26	<drivetrax>	If you are using an earlier version, and want to 'skip' a version, the only safe way is to backup your data and do a fresh install, or to progressively upgrade to each successive version.
[22:26	<noodlesgc>	nuSharper it should. the only way to be completely sure is to try
[22:26	<hwilde>	lunartear, ssh -vvv    it will show you verbose output
[22:26	<romanotp>	thanx guys for the help, see you soon
[22:26	<lunartear>	hwilde ok
[22:26	<mistapapa>	hwilde: kk
[22:26	<daemon3>	chubs730: I know, it should.  But it doesn't.
[22:26	<noodlesgc>	drivetrax i thought they made it possible to upgrade between LTS's
[22:26	<drivetrax>	The LTS version is recommended for people in an environment (generally commercial/industrial) that want to keep the same version for a longer amount of time and do not require newer/faster/updated versions, but instead do not want things to change.
[22:26	<jpruskin>	!lilo
[22:26	<ubotu>	lilo is an alternative [Li]nux Boot[Lo]ader. Note: it is recommended that you use GRUB on Ubuntu instead.

[22:27	<foosh>	http://pastebin.com/d678f8b6c

[22:27	<hwilde>	lunartear,  you probably have to install the key in user_Y:~/.ssh/authorized_keys

[22:27	<chubs730>	daemon3: odd, and apt-get dist-upgrade does nothing??
[22:27	<lunartear>	hwilde, i did that
[22:27	<daemon3>	chubs730: Right.  It doesn't do anything.
[22:27	<Swian>	really because it stated on the ubuntu site you could uninstall
[22:27	<foosh>	its ext3 and i've just had defaults on in the past to successful rw for all users

[22:28	<mohbana>	hwilde: i hope i was clear, why aren't they any themes to start of with?
[22:28	<graingert>	crimsun: it it possible to stream over the internet?
[22:28	<chuy_max>	hi, I had hardy heron beta installed, now I wanted to upgrade to stable via update-manager, but I get a message telling me that "Not all updates can be installed", any ideas?
[22:28	<MRutter>	hwilde: those troubleshooting guides don't seem to apply. Spring uses openal, which defaults to using OSS. under 7.10 Spring worked fine, but with 8.04 it only works if its the only audio application running. If another audio application is running I get this error: ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:874:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
[22:28	<hwilde>	mohbana, you have to install the themese yourself
[22:28	<MRutter>	open /dev/[sound/]dsp: Device or resource busy
[22:28	<graingert>	crimsun: via ssh etc
[22:28	<Pilha>	I have a question about linux-rt
[22:28	<crimsun>	graingert: I just told you the menu you need to choose.
[22:28	<mohbana>	hwilde: why? in gusty they would come with emerald
[22:28	<drivetrax>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades
[22:28	<crimsun>	MRutter: pasuspender -- Spring
[22:28	<hwilde>	MRutter, right, only one app can access the hardware at a time :/
[22:28	<noodlesgc>	nuSharper xfce is easy to get used to, just boot off a live cd and try it out, or install the xubuntu-desktop package from the repo
[22:29	<hwilde>	mohbana, this isn't gusty anymore!
[22:29	<GreenFuze>	Hi, my hardy heron get stuck when the login window should pop-up.  instead, nothing happens
[22:29	<cardstroker>	how do i shutdown from the command line?
[22:29	<Pilha>	I had installed (via Synaptic) linux-rt in Ubuntu7.10; after upgrade to 8.04 I find myself with too many linuxes to boot from, it seems
[22:29	<graingert>	crimsun: that's all enabled
[22:29	<crimsun>	hwilde: no, that's due to the way pulseaudio is configured, which I'm attempting to alter for 8.04.1.
[22:29	<chuy_max>	is it safe to upgrade?
[22:29	<mistapapa>	hwilde: i've sent you an im
[22:29	<mistapapa>	hwilde: did you get it?
[22:29	<daemon3>	noodlesgc: It appears to be frozen when I run do-release-upgrade
[22:29	<kindofabuzz>	for those of you that have broadcom chips wireless, all i did was edit /etc/modepok just did sucessful upgrade, but my grub still lists 7.10 for this drive, how can i fix that?
[22:29	<covalent>	cardstroker: use 'shutdown -h now'
[22:29	<nael>	This might be a silly question but, I have the release candidate for hardy are there any advantages for me to install the hardy that came out on the 24th?
[22:30	<foosh>	any takers?
[22:30	<kindofabuzz>	ooops
[22:30	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 at which step
[22:30	<crimsun>	graingert: and in Preferences?
[22:30	<drivetrax>	You Use Update Manager to Check for Updates.. get them, then a window should open, and tell you Hardy is available.. click Upgrade
[22:30	<kindofabuzz>	for those of you that have broadcom chips wireles just did sucessful upgrade, but my grub still lists 7.10 for this drive, how can i fix that?
[22:30	<kindofabuzz>	damnit
[22:30	<EruditeHermit>	hey, I tried upgrading to hardy, but the upgrade failed and when I try to login, I get a brown background. However, I am able to login via console. When I login with console, and try to do apt-get upgrade or apt-get -f install it says that dpkg-divert rename involves overwriting /sbin/depmod with different file, not allowed.
[22:30	<graingert>	crimsun: all checked
[22:30	<noodlesgc>	nael no, the newer Hardy is more stable and is supported
[22:30	<kindofabuzz>	sucessful upgrade, but my grub still lists 7.10 for this drive, how can i fix that?
[22:30	<spartanii117>	chuy_max: i have successfully upgraded both a 32bit systems without a problem
[22:30	<b33r_>	how can I change iced tea java cache directory?
[22:30	<GreenFuze>	EruditeHermit - I got the same problem!
[22:30	<fredmv>	Hardy is like using win an an operating system form.
[22:30	<Pilha>	all they're all named Ubuntu 8.04 by Grub, but I have kernels 2.6.24-16-rt, 2.6.24-16-generic and 2.6.24-14-rt (all with and w/o recovery mode)
[22:30	<pagoda>	is the bookmarks file for firefox 3 beta 5 in the same place as firefox 2?
[22:31	<cardstroker>	covalent, says "Need to be root."
[22:31	<daemon3>	noodlesgc: "Checking for new Ubuntu Release"

[22:31	<EruditeHermit>	GreenFuze: did you workaround it?
[22:31	<nael>	noodlesgc: thanks
[22:31	<MRutter>	crimsun: well that kinda works, but all it does is stop sound mixing and gives priority to spring
[22:31	<keymoo>	is it possible to upgrade from the CD? i have burnt a hardy CD - can I upgrade my desktops with that?
[22:31	<drivetrax>	Upgrading using the alternate CD/DVD - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades
[22:31	<covalent>	cardstroker: use 'sudo shutdown -h now' and your password.
[22:31	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 yes i got that too for a while. i just hit ctrl+c and chose a different server
[22:31	<GreenFuze>	nope, really stuck here...
[22:31	<pagoda>	graingert: ie, ~/.mozilla/firefox/423hg5k.default/bookmarks.html?
[22:31	<chuy_max>	spartanii117, did you read my first message?
[22:31	<Ntemis>	hello
[22:31	<Pilha>	booting 2.6.24-16-generic worked fine, but 2.6.24-16-rt froze before log in screen even showed up
[22:31	<spartanii117>	keymoo: yes, but you need the alternate cd
[22:31	<Ntemis>	i need some help please
[22:31	<graingert>	pagoda oh I thought you meant the shortcut
[22:32	<livingdaylight>	does one need to install anything extra to get the cube?
[22:32	<noodlesgc>	keymoo yes, to a certain extent. type gksu sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade
[22:32	<Ntemis>	after i type
[22:32	<Pilha>	any hints? maybe just reinstalling linux-rt via Synaptic?
[22:32	<Ntemis>	apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse
[22:32	<Ntemis>	 gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg libxine1-ffmpeg libdvdread3
[22:32	<livingdaylight>	how do i get the cube?
[22:32	<Ntemis>	ask foe y/n and i press Y and says abort
[22:32	<pagoda>	graingert, so you don't know?
[22:32	<drivetrax>	livingdaylight:  get into #compiz-fusion
[22:32	<keymoo>	thanks
[22:32	<daemon3>	noodlesgc: I was actually running aptitude at the same time.  I'll try it again.  Thanks for your help by the way.  I can tell it's a hectic day in IRC.
[22:32	<fiz1>	livingdaylight, that is an option you can apply in advanced desktop settings
[22:32	<ravi_>	livingdaylight, you need to isntall Compiz Config advanced settings manager
[22:32	<graingert>	pagoda: no lol

[22:33	<MRutter>	hwilde: you have any idea hwilde, or do you know where I could go to where someone would know?
[22:33	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 yes it is
[22:33	<jpruskin>	I'm trying to install/configure LILO, and have opened my etc/fstab file, but it contains barely anything, and certainly nothing like the example- how daring can I be in attempting to change it?
[22:33	<livingdaylight>	ravi_, is that in synaptic?

[22:33	<livingdaylight>	fiz1, is that under settings?

[22:33	<noodlesgc>	ok good luck everyone i have to leave
[22:33	<covalent>	cardstroker: -h = halt  -r = restart for your information. and you're welcome
[22:33	<fiz1>	livingdaylight, you have to download compiz advanced settings manager, you can get that in the add/remove applications

[22:34	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 i have to leave, but keep trying
[22:34	<kindofabuzz>	sucessful upgrade, but my grub still lists 7.10 for this drive, how can i fix that?
[22:34	<daemon3>	noodlesgc: It's owkring now, I think.  Thanks.
[22:34	<kindofabuzz>	what's the command to see kernel version?
[22:34	<hwilde>	lunartear, ok so yeah it is not finding the local side of the key
[22:34	<ruewan>	is there a way to tell what process is reading from my hard drive?
[22:34	<bastid_raZor>	i upgraded to heron and now my monitor(actually it is my tv) is Not supported.. i'm getting failed modules in nvidia_new and nvidia_legacy  i have a pastebin of .xsession-errors and my xorg at :: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64427/
[22:34	<doug2266778822>	moveax: i as well am lost i have done million of things and on same distro as you.
[22:34	<nucco>	Steve^^ did you notice unusual disk activity before it died? (that is, was it running?)
[22:34	<hwilde>	MRutter, I do not think you wil be able to have two processes access the sound card at the same time
[22:35	<hwilde>	ruewan, type "top"  then hit capital C    that will show you the processes running sorted by cpu.
[22:35	<tanya>	hello
[22:35	<chuy_max>	Hi, I installed Hardy Heron Beta a couple of weeks ago today I wanted to update my system, but I get "Not all updates can be installed", what's up with that?
[22:35	<EruditeHermit>	GreenFuze: I seem to have managed to workaround it. I will let you know once it is done if it worked
[22:35	<lunartear>	hwilde, the same key works for userX@host2.com
[22:35	<SkaBeat>	hi
[22:35	<Steve^^>	nucco, I had just plugged in a memory stick and the power cord when it went.
[22:35	<nwillett>	Should there be a bunch of updates waiting in the update manager after I install 8.04. I installed, went to check update manager and it said everything was up to date but I can't tell if that's the truth or if it's just that the servers are fubared.
[22:35	<tiax>	Hi, after upgrading to hardy yesterday, some programs won't start or some action will faile (e.g. accessing sftp locations in nautilus) due to "ressources" being "temporarily not available", even when I start new shells it gives me "cannot fork: ressource temporarily unavailable"
[22:35	<hwilde>	lunartear, can you pastebin you terminal output?
[22:35	<MRutter>	hwilde: But i was able to do that in all the previous releases of ubuntu
[22:35	<SkaBeat>	im tryng to do a fresh install of 8.04 but when booting from my laptop get : initt: respawwning too fast, stopped
[22:35	<SkaBeat>	wats wronbg with it=? :S
[22:35	<hwilde>	MRutter, there is an #alsa channel
[22:36	<nucco>	Steve^^: are you sure that it is ubuntu that died, and not your main board?
[22:36	<zoommy99>	does anyone know how to get XFI sound to work in Hardy
[22:36	<Pilha>	hi ppl, can anyone give me some hints about an rt kernel?
[22:36	<tiax>	what's happening here? It's not about RAM, is it? I have 3 GB + 3GB Swap
[22:36	<MRutter>	hwild: ok, I'll give that a shot
[22:36	<Pilha>	(namely 2.6.24-16-rt)
[22:36	<periscope>	hi, somehow I seem to have borked my sound again. I was trying to do the libflashsupport fix for the flash nosound bug, and now I have no sound for anything at all
[22:36	<josh04>	Anyone here with detailed knowledge of debugging sleep?
[22:36	<lunartear>	hwilde, of just userX@host1 to userY@host2?
[22:36	<ruewan>	nothing suspicious there
[22:36	<periscope>	I also have no sound in the sound test thing, even though I know it is not muted and etc, and also amarok freezes when I play a song
[22:36	<ravi_>	josh04, whats the problem?
[22:36	<tawt>	!pastebin
[22:36	<ubotu>	pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[22:36	<livingdaylight>	fiz1, Advanced Effects Settings?
[22:36	<hwilde>	lunartear, do ssh -v to the one that works, then ssh -v to the one that doesn't work, and pastebin the whole thing
[22:36	<keit1>	well... just copied my old backup home folder from an external to my current home folder and now everything is ballsed up. presume my permissions ahve gone carzy (even though its same user name et al) so how do I fix this as hardly any programs start and when I try to chown it keeps feeding back this error chown: cannot access `/home/keito/.gvfs': Permission denied
[22:36	<Steve^^>	nucco, everything froze, the numlock and capslock lights flashed on and off. No commands worked, not even REISUB (though I don't know if that ever works)
[22:36	<hwilde>	!sound | periscope
[22:36	<ubotu>	periscope: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[22:36	<lunartear>	hwilde ok
[22:36	<doug2266778822>	moveax: i even made a post on ubuntu forum for it but no one seems to want to answer this question.
[22:37	<ravi_>	livingdaylight, you may need to add additional software sources. search for CCSM on web
[22:37	<mark_>	hi. anyone know how to get rid of kde if installed thru synaptec without having to uninstall every goddam thing individually?!
[22:37	<moveax>	doug2266778822: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats <- this any good?
[22:37	<livingdaylight>	ravi_, i see ccsm in Add/Remove
[22:37	<keit1>	this is the command i used to try to get my permissions back ... chown: cannot access `/home/keito/.gvfs': Permission denied
[22:37	<moveax>	mark_: remove kdebase
[22:37	<hwilde>	keit1, sudo chown
[22:37	<nucco>	Steve^^: I mean, is the system booting at all? the bios. not that I can help though, my own 7.10 just packed up today, showed unusual load, I had to power-cycle, then, that was it.
[22:37	<moveax>	mark_: everything kde depends on it
[22:37	<kindofabuzz>	major problem here, somehow the upgrade didn't update my grub, so i am now running Hardy on the gutsy kernel, how can i fix that?
[22:37	<Lyk4n>	#xkcd-signal
[22:37	<fiz1>	lvingdaylight, yes, just search for compiz in the add/remove apps program, it should show up, select and install it and then open it via system>preferences>advanced settings manager
[22:37	<doug2266778822>	moveax: nope i done that as well nothing worked.

[22:38	<mark_>	will that keep all the apps tho?

[22:39	<nibsa1242b>	tawt: I don't see one listed there. Is the wireless card turned on?

[22:39	<Steve^^>	nucco, that's not ideal! (Ironically, I just ordered a new HDD to put 8.04 on, I drop my laptop too much to expect the current one to last forever)
[22:39	<donomo>	damn this is fun.

[22:40	<kindofabuzz>	hwilde: and i thought my wireless was working with hardy, well it is, but now i know it doesn't work because of the kernel with hardy since i'm running hardy on gutsy kernel, i guess i confused it by having hardy already on another partition
[22:40	<GreenFuze>	EruditeHermit: thanks alot mate!

[22:41	<hwilde>	kindofabuzz, fix your grub and boot hte correct kernel

[22:42	<doug2266778822>	moveax: if you find the answer out you let me know please? in #wwed as for i am going afk for awhile.
[22:42	<hwilde>	Pilha, I guess the bot doesn't know but look for rtlinux
[22:42	<nucco>	ruewan: but its mostly harmless if you've got a dual core cpu
[22:42	<fiz1>	livingdaylight, another thing you might want to look at is system>preferences>appearance and then the tab visual settings

[22:42	<Pilha>	hwilde: ok, will do
[22:43	<jburd>	Hardy is a waste of time.

[22:43	<Jeah>	Can anybody help me with a weird window manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy?  Xfce4-terminal is opening without window decorations.  It has the right shape, but instead of the title bar, frame, close button, etc it is just solid black.  I can click where the buttons should be and they work, but they're not visible.  Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  Compositing is off.  I tried re-do
[22:43	<kindofabuzz>	hwilde: i had this partiton with guty and another with hardy, just updated this gutsy, but it didn't put the new kernel in grub for this partiton, this part still says 7.10
[22:43	<Pilha>	there is a linux-rt package in synaptic, my problem is at boot time with it
[22:43	<anteatersa>	and the old tool has dissapeared as well
[22:43	<keit1>	ahhh, forgot to make an evoltuion back before refoematting but _did_ backup my home folder.  it still appears to want to start afresh now I try to launch it... any help!???
[22:43	<Pilha>	will study more

[22:43	<Ben225>	I'm having trouble upgrading from 7.10 to 8.04. It seems to download files VERY slowly and quit at a different point each time I try it. Is there something wrong with Canonical's servers?
[22:43	<hwilde>	jburd, hit ctrl+alt+f1   can you get to the terminal ?
[22:43	<jburd>	fbc: ASUS M2N VM DH with an nvidia 6100 graphics card with an AMD X2 dual core processor
[22:43	<kindofabuzz>	hwilde: i'm gonna delete the other partition with hardy and reinstall grub and hope it fixes it
[22:43	<jburd>	hwilde: yes I can
[22:44	<nucco>	SyaZ: turn on the wireless first?
[22:44	<calc>	Ben225: too many people downloading at one time

[22:44	<drivetrax>	livingdaylight:  First - right click the desktop, and get backgrounds..set, click Visual effects tab
[22:44	<kindofabuzz>	wel that's what i mean
[22:44	<jburd>	fbc: Gutsy loaded *perfectly* fine.  I don't know what Hardy has done to break all of that.
[22:44	<Styrbjorn>	hmm has vmware been removed from the ubuntu repro in the latest upgrade?
[22:44	<fbc>	 jburd which CD did you use?
[22:44	<nibsa1242b>	tawt: wow... I don't see anything
[22:44	<drivetrax>	livingdaylight:  try to set "Custom"
[22:44	<kindofabuzz>	hwilde: i may just stick with this kernel since my wireless works on it
[22:44	<fbc>	jburd, alternative or desktop?
[22:44	<jburd>	fbc: I used the alternate disc to install because the live cd did the same thing as the installation.
[22:45	<ruewan>	think i found how to kill tracker
[22:45	<kindofabuzz>	hardy on gutsy kernel, working good so far

[22:45	<nucco>	jburd: if the livecd didn't boot fine, you probably shouldn't have installed
=== ps_shino is now known as mlhshino
[22:45	<tawt>	nibsa1242b, I think it might be Realtek
[22:45	<Mustard_Is_Blue>	anybody know anything about acpi?
[22:45	<SyaZ>	hwilde, I don't really know what kind, but it's Acer Travelmate 2355 and 802.11b/g wireless LAN.
[22:45	<nucco>	ruewan: please don't kill tracker. just go disable it.
[22:45	<alastor666>	bonne nuit recycled :)
[22:45	<jburd>	nucco: Both upgrading and clean installs failed.
[22:45	<NicDumZ>	No sound since upgrade to hardy, with HDA Intel. Backports are on. I tried several fixes, installing pulseaudio, vlc-plugin-pulse, none of these helped. Alsamixer volume is up... Where can I look now ???

[22:45	<fbc>	jburd,  right,, so when you get a blank screen is the hard drive still going??
[22:45	<ruewan>	disabled it in the session options
[22:45	<amenado>	billisnice->	i would not doubt it
[22:45	<dumnut>	hi, i am installing kubuntu8.04amd64, in partition it said to partition for root, but scroll down only has choices for ext3 ext2 reiserfs jfs xfs fat16 fat32 swap and dontuse, where do i go to select root?
[22:45	<livingdaylight>	drivetrax, there is 'none' 'normal' and 'extra'
[22:45	<delphi>	does anyone know why.. when I log into my ubuntu server and I get prompted for my username, it takes a good few seconds before I get asked for my password?
[22:45	<jburd>	fbc: yeah
[22:46	<ruewan>	my hard drive is still going
[22:46	<hwilde>	SyaZ, type in "lspci -v"   do any of those seem like wireless to you
[22:46	<drivetrax>	livingdaylight:  -- if it is extra, you may need to try to look at your video card driver.. change them to get the Custom.. and set preferences
[22:46	<lunartear>	hwilde: http://nopaste.snit.ch/12819
[22:46	<nucco>	jburd: I mean if the livecd didn't boot fine, you shouldn't have upgraded or something.
[22:46	<Pilha>	ok another totally unrelated question: can I change the size of icons on the desktop like I do in a folder window? if so, how?
[22:46	<Starnestommy>	delphi: select ext3 as the type and / as the mount point

[22:46	<alastor666>	sorry all je me croyais mirc -_-
[22:46	<nibsa1242b>	tawt: the problem is that if it doesn't show up... the system won't know its there and you won't be able to use it
[22:46	<amenado>	delphi->	cud it possibly it is trying to resolved your ip address? look into pam.d modules for configuring that?
[22:46	<Mustard_Is_Blue>	anyone know how to disable ASPI?
[22:46	<ceil420>	i think my distro upgrade got frozen :( it's been "Configuring motion" for like 5mins... with no change
[22:46	<jburd>	nucco: Ah, with the upgrade I could log in to a non functional gnome desktop.  With a clean install, nothing works.
[22:46	<nucco>	Pilha: just increase the default zoom size in file management preferences

[22:47	<nucco>	jburd: start with the one that annoys you first :)
[22:47	<fbc>	jburd, wait until the hard drive stops going before determining you have no login... You can always try pressing CTRL-ALT-F3 to see if you have a terminal session visible...
[22:47	<nibsa1242b>	tawt: I know are you sure its on (the light is blinking or what not).
[22:47	<spatry>	blank screen after loggin... is that a known problem with Hardy??

[22:50	<Mustard_Is_Blue>	ok thankyou.

[22:56	<whirlybird20>	I opened the synaptic package manager and searched for ﻿libdvdcss and several results came up
[22:56	<whirlybird20>	I already have libdvdreal3
[22:57	<Derspankster>	XVampireX: then uninstall from synaptic and reinstall
[22:57	<smithey93>	Lifeisfunny, im useing 8.04, and ccsm isnt there when i apt-get
[22:57	<whirlybird20>	is that the right one?
[22:57	<unocrash>	how do i get Compiz again? i ALWAYS forget......

[22:57	<whirlybird20>	what about libdvdread-dev?
[22:57	<johnmike>	koomber: are you installing by disk?  How would you revert back to previous OSs if anything? Just reinstall it all?
[22:57	<catmistake>	there should be... idk... #ubuntu2, #ubuntu3, etc...
[22:57	<Starnestommy>	whirlybird20: try running sudo sh /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh
[22:57	<corbett>	drivetrax: it work perfecly on windows on another pc, is ntsf, i've not anything special to get it part for ub.

[22:59	<catmistake>	nucco: thanks for the reassurance

[22:59	<acoustyk>	ideas?
[22:59	<unocrash>	i need ccsm.
[22:59	<Lifeisfunny>	smithey93,   compizconfig-settings-manager           i left out the s in settings, again, my bad
[23:00	<smithey93>	Lifeisfunny: yea thats it, its just i forgot what it was called after installing hardy and i like having effects well, because my pc copes well with it lol and i push it to the max
[23:00	<nucco>	catmistake: don't try to follow everything though LOL

[23:01	<Rankbine>	hola a todos

[23:01	<Derspankster>	XVampireX: well, then do so, remove config files
[23:01	<catmistake>	nucco: are you using hardy?
[23:01	<carpark>	hi, i upgraded yesterday and i'm having an issue w/ firefox - when i watch videos on a website, i get no sound. downloaded videos & music play fine, but firefox will play no sounds

[23:02	<lunartear>	hwilde, somehow the key i originally copied got corrupted.  its working now...   Why would ssh not give a warning about the key verification failing or something
[23:02	<XVampireX>	Derspankster, It only uninstalls and then only installs opera and still doesn't work...
[23:02	<drivetrax>	corbett:  Do you need to keep the ntfs.. is the drive for data, or installing Linux
[23:02	<nucco>	catmistake: although I have got a slow connection, so I can't blame the mirrors!
[23:02	<doug2266778822>	moveax: so that code works for you? weird how it wont work for me.

[23:02	<carpark>	tawt: is this common, or is it just a small percentage of us? maybe it's an issue with the beta version?
[23:02	<fbc>	jburd, a person with the same problem your having referenced it as his solution..
[23:02	<amenado>	Darknezz->	can you do  a  dig   @64.59.176.15  www.yahoo.com ?
[23:02	<johnmike>	What's the best way to back everything up before upgrading?
[23:03	<corbett>	drivetrax: the drive is for data -so i guess you're suggesting i convert it?
[23:03	<nucco>	catmistake: if your questions aren't specific to hardy, I could help, in any case, asking them here is more likely to get you answers or responses
[23:03	<tawt>	carpark, i think we installed a bad plugin.  i don't yet know how to fix it
[23:03	<freeman163>	for some reason, ubuntu won't recognize my keyboard layout until i login with qwerty (i use dvorak). any way to fix this?
[23:03	<Derspankster>	XVampireX: does FF3 work?
[23:03	<catmistake>	nucco: I got the alternate yesterday... I always curl because I hate leaving a browser open when I'm not using it. I'll be replacing a edgy install... but... it works so well, I 'm almost afraid to... gotta do backups.
[23:03	<johnmike>	I tried searching google and no one has a direct answer! ;)
[23:03	<drivetrax>	corbett:  -- no,, not at all.. asking..
[23:03	<XVampireX>	Derspankster, yeah
[23:03	<drivetrax>	corbett:  searching now
[23:03	<tawt>	carpark, before i did a clean install, i had sound working for vids
[23:03	<unocrash>	what's new in Hardy?
[23:03	<nucco>	catmistake: you should get the livecd and test it, just to be sure everything is cool.
[23:03	<XVampireX>	Derspankster, I installed beta opera and it works
[23:03	<carpark>	tawt: it's weird though, i watched a video maybe 15 minutes ago just fine, it seemed to stop when i opened rythmbox because everything then went slow - i don't know if it's a coincidence or something, though

[23:04	<nucco>	unocrash: there's a tour guide at www.ubuntu.com
[23:04	<catmistake>	nucco: I've been waiting for the LTS, for... well, years now... I didn't like Dapper, but edgy worked great, so I used that... but its getting long in the tooth...
[23:04	<jrabbit>	I get a No Bootable Device error on boot to my third parttion on my intel mac I am able to boot to it and have installed GRUB to the / parttion with /home folowing

[23:04	<Derspankster>	XVamireX: I'm not on a hardy box right now.
[23:04	<Darknezz>	amenado: it seems to work
[23:04	<rjonesx>	how would one update either python or cairo or both from the command line?
[23:04	<hwilde>	lunartear, I dunno, ssh -vvv
[23:05	<rjonesx>	or uninstall and reinstall them?
[23:05	<XVampireX>	Derspankster, Yeah
[23:05	<nucco>	catmistake: dappar was my best ever ubuntu, I hope hardy doesn't disappoint me too.
[23:05	<catmistake>	nucco: its not so much the release I'm worried about, its getting everything back just so from a clean install
[23:05	<tawt>	carpark, try restarting firefox

[23:05	<unocrash>	I mean I upgraded to Hardy today (took all the way from 7:35 to 12:00) And im extremely used to using ubuntu (and SUSE Linux), and Hardy doesn't feel new....
[23:05	<unocrash>	ill see wahts new on the website
[23:05	<unocrash>	brb
[23:05	<nucco>	catmistake: as you get better with linux, you might find that you can have a separate partition for /home, then when you do a clean install, you don't have to lose all your data :)
[23:05	<lunartear>	hwilde, thats the command i issued but didnt see anything
[23:05	<bastid_raZor>	i upgraded to heron and now my monitor(actually it is my tv) is Not supported.. i'm getting failed modules in nvidia_new and nvidia_legacy  i have a pastebin of .xsession-errors and my xorg at :: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64427/
[23:05	<unocrash>	\
[23:05	<lunartear>	hwilde: ohwell its fixed.. thanks
[23:05	<Derspankster>	XVampireX: I do run hardy on my laptop and my server has been upgraded as well but I'm waiting for the smoke to clear to upgrade this desktop.
[23:06	<derenrich>	Is there any way for me to change the compiz effects level from the command line? I screwed around too much and now I'm frozen out.
[23:06	<Rolcol>	Has anyone had a problem in Hardy in which the shadows, scroll bars, and buttons don't look like they should?
[23:06	<doug2266778822>	is there any codes i can use that will let me watch protected Dvd's?
[23:06	<nucco>	catmistake: and it doesn't take long to get things back *better* than they were before
[23:06	<catmistake>	nucco: ah... that's a great idea. I left some space on the partition to install Solaris on the same box, but never bothered... so I have to repartition anyway to recover that extra 30GB or so
[23:06	<XVampireX>	Derspankster, Alright
[23:06	<carpark>	tawt: i closed rhythmbox and then reloaded the page, and the video played with sound! do you think your problem might've occured because of a media player also?
[23:06	<nucco>	catmistake: yeah, for me, I make 10G for "/" , 1G for swap, and the rest for "/home"
[23:06	<jburd>	fbc: Heck, even dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg does not work.  It still creates a blank xorg.conf.
[23:07	<B-rabbit>	catmistake, you are as important as everyone else here :) and if u want to talk about something me and everyone else will be more than happy to help u out
[23:07	<drivetrax>	corbett:  -- go here!  http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Ubuntu/2008-04/msg00879.html
[23:07	<naranco>	sound seems to be an issue (or the mixer)
[23:07	<catmistake>	nucco: one thing I've gotten used to is nxserver... and NoMachine is real slow in updating... so I'm ... well, asking now if anyone knows if nxserver works in hardy?
[23:07	<B-rabbit>	catmistake, just askaway :)
[23:07	<jburd>	fbc: I can't use "Restricted Drivers Manager" if I don't have a GUI to use
[23:07	<Lifeisfunny>	Rolcol, I did,it was on the amd64 version ........... I fixed it by installing the 32 bit version
[23:07	<Itaku>	im on 8.04 and im wondering how i reinstall mysql-server completely so it asks me for a root pass again
[23:07	<Starnestommy>	doug2266778822: libdvdcss, which can be installed via sudo sh /usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/install-css.sh after libdvdread3 is installed
[23:07	<catmistake>	thanks B-rabbit
[23:07	<towlie>	  
[23:07	<carpark>	tawt, but here's the weird thing: with the vid playing, i opened rhythmbox, and now THAT won't play songs while the video is playing...
[23:07	<Darknezz>	amenado: when i want to install or download (apt -get instal) it says unable to resolve host (home)
[23:07	<tawt>	carpark, no.  i have no media player yet (clean installed about an hour ago) I think it's the plugin.  how do i download other plugings?
[23:07	<corbett>	drivetrax: thats me
[23:07	<tawt>	carpark, ...
[23:07	<Lifeisfunny>	it might not be what you want to do, I admit
[23:07	<catmistake>	nxserver on hardy? anyone?
[23:07	<Rolcol>	Lifeisfunny, well, I have the 32 bit installed.... I guess Ill have to do a reinstall
[23:07	<fbc>	jburd, keeep on reading the guid
[23:08	<acoustyk>	my mouse scroll works!
[23:08	<nucco>	catmistake: never heard of nxserver and nomachine though... I won't expect them to break, especially if they're in in ubuntu's repositories
[23:08	<acoustyk>	wooohoo!
[23:08	<corinth>	Is there a command to reconfigure a program to its default settings?
[23:08	<tawt>	carpark, interesting.  i have too little experience to deal with this
[23:08	<Lr5>	corinth: maybe dpkg-reconfigure
[23:08	<jrabbit>	I get a No Bootable Device error on boot to my third parttion on my intel mac I am able to boot to it and have installed GRUB to the / parttion with /home folowing ?????
[23:08	<Lr5>	no idea if that does it though
[23:08	<amenado>	Darknezz->	hard to assist you if you are hiding your ip address, hard to tell what the error is really telling you
[23:08	<jrabbit>	I've never gotten this error from GRUB
[23:08	<catmistake>	nucco: I don't think their in the repositories... I'm pretty sure I dled binaries from NoMachine
[23:08	<oddalot>	anyone gotten emerald repositories to work?
[23:08	<fbc>	jburd, you'll get to a section that tells you if you get a blank screen press CTRL-ALT-F1 adn login and alter your xorg.conf with special parameters so that you can get a picture...
[23:08	<nucco>	corinth: completely remove the package, and then reinstall it.
[23:08	<carpark>	tawt: plugins for firefox? click 'tools'>'add-ons'>'get add-ons' :)
[23:08	<ruthbuzzard>	hey did they finally fix the libata or whatever the problem was that caused slow dvd burning on non sata (plextor?) drives
[23:09	<ruthbuzzard>	in 8.04
[23:09	<doug2266778822>	Starnestommy: when i type that i get this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64433/
[23:09	<corbett>	drivetrax: shall i paste dmesg ouput with the ehd plugged?
[23:09	<illDecree>	hey everyone
[23:09	<nucco>	catmistake: in that case, its only a matter of time before they provide binaries for hardy.  you might wish to wait for them, or upgrade and wait for them
[23:09	<tawt>	carpark, which video plugin do you have?
[23:09	<drivetrax>	corbett:  -- then go here.. check again -- the command that tells if the disk is formatted!  -  http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Ubuntu/2008-04/msg00881.html
[23:09	<fbc>	jburd, something about changing "NV" to "NVIDIA" and a couple other parameters to get your video to come up
[23:09	<Darknezz>	amenado: you need my ip?
[23:09	<doug2266778822>	Starnestommy: after i hit enter it went through a whole ten min ordeal then it still does not work.
[23:09	<amenado>	Darknezz->	no the ip from the errors..
[23:10	<carpark>	tawt: doh! i gave you directions for extensions, not plugins. i have divx and totem
[23:10	<amenado>	Darknezz->	paste the whole error and not translate it
[23:10	<Itaku>	im on 8.04 and im wondering how i reinstall mysql-server completely so it asks me for a root pass again... not just the --reinstall option
[23:10	<hwilde>	plik, rsync -av is not preserving ownership
[23:10	<AngryBacon>	Is downloading from apt being very slow for anyone?
[23:10	<hwilde>	Itaku, remove --purge
[23:10	<Starnestommy>	AngryBacon: yes.
[23:10	<catmistake>	nucco: I'm not so optimistic. They haven't even fixed their OS X client for leopard yet... but, well, Apple's got a problem with their X11 and XQuartz anyway that their not rushing to fix either
[23:10	<carpark>	tawt: and there's a windows media, also
=== dubby is now known as dice14u
[23:10	<Itaku>	k thanks
[23:10	<hwilde>	AngryBacon, everyone is upgrading man
[23:10	<AngryBacon>	Starnestommy: thats what i figured

[23:10	<jburd>	hwilde: not everybody is upgrading.

[23:23	<MachinTrucChose>	can someone tell me how to stop Nautilus from displaying thumbnails for videos? That "media preview" crap is one of the things I hated the most on Windows, I can't believe it's enabled in Ubuntu.

[23:25	<ettore>	I've installed ubuntustudio 8.04 and my hd icon are ghost, why ?
[23:25	<amenado>	mtaylor the camelot host is the new ubuntu 8.04 ?
[23:25	<unop>	roffe__, ok, it does not say much about what the requirements are - try install xsltproc first and then ./configure again .. if you run into problems, post output to pastebin again
[23:25	<nucco>	mtaylor, hwilde, hmmm... never needed to do the whole X display thing before. -Y usually suffices for me, I can run almost any app that way
[23:25	<whirlybird20>	When I click record on xvidcap the program closes, Wink wont open at all, and Istanbul crashes when you click record
[23:25	<Derspankster>	grandpa: should

[23:33	<umpc|ubuntu>	i just got hardy and my wireless doesnt work
[23:33	<Crshman>	hwilde, i can't update it from within the distro?
[23:33	<unop>	roffe__, no, without the right headers the compile will definitely fail - thats how code works
[23:33	<kbrooks>	cronix, to help...
[23:33	<heartsblood>	cronix: I had that to, are you running a raid setup by any chance?
[23:33	<towlie>	is hardy supposed to use 2.6.22.14 kernel  ?
[23:33	<milly1234>	or rt2x00 module
[23:33	<hwilde>	Crshman, you have to boot from the cd
[23:33	<nucco>	!grub | cronix
[23:33	<ubotu>	cronix: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[23:33	<kbrooks>	cronix, root (hd0,2)
[23:33	<mtaylor>	amenado: I didn't have xauth on the server, I should clarify
[23:33	<whirlybird20>	﻿When I click record on xvidcap the program closes, Wink wont open at all, and Istanbul crashes when you click record. Does anyone know of a solution or maybe another screen capturing program?
[23:33	<josh04>	Does anyone know when we're getting an Ibex board on ubuntuforums.org :P
[23:33	<umpc|ubuntu>	i just got hardy and my wireless does'nt work how can i fix this?
[23:33	<unop>	roffe__, does that package come with a README/INSTALL file?
[23:33	<hwilde>	psych, put "auto wlan0" on the line before iface wlan0   and it will come up automatically
[23:33	<psych>	hwilde, got it?
[23:33	<DBautell>	To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[23:33	<kenan>	hi, i installed hardy heron and i still cant allow multiple applications access soundcard, how come?
[23:33	<milly1234>	umpc|ubuntu, I've been trying to figure that one out too
[23:33	<kbrooks>	cronix, then kernel /boot/<replace this with pressing the tab key>
[23:33	<DaveG|>	hey, how do i upgrade my 7.10 to 8.04 by just using a cd? i don't want to download all the files again.
[23:33	<roffe__>	unop: yeah, a very basic one.. pastbin? :)
[23:33	<josh04>	kenan: Which appliations?
[23:34	<Darknezz>	amenado: thanks for the help it works now :-D
[23:34	<unop>	roffe__, ok sure
[23:34	<Crshman>	DBautell, i've tried this
[23:34	<szenti>	hwilde, do you recommend me to create a separate /home partition?
[23:34	<Veinor>	DaveG|: what do you mean 'download all the files'?
[23:34	<kbrooks>	cronix, then initrd /boot/<replace this with pressing the tab key>
[23:34	<DBautell>	Crshman, and I just did it
[23:34	<amenado>	Darknezz->	cool
[23:34	<kbrooks>	cronix, then boot
[23:34	<kenan>	josh04: well an example is youtube videos and rhythmbox
[23:34	<DaveG|>	Veinor, by doing it using update-manger -d
[23:34	<szenti>	I know it's safer to have one.
[23:34	<amenado>	Darknezz->	thats hardy?
[23:34	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: boot to it
[23:34	<hwilde>	szenti, if you want to.  it's a personal preference
[23:34	<szenti>	And it's easier to backup.
[23:34	<umpc|ubuntu>	milly1234 they need to take ubuntu 7 wifi support and put it in 8
[23:34	<DaveG|>	KooperKool, i don't want to burn a cd :P
[23:34	<josh04>	kenan: try installing libflashsupport with synaptic
[23:34	<kbrooks>	cronix, in kernel and initrd when you tab you need to look for the revelant files, eg vmlinuz
[23:34	<nucco>	hwilde: why won't you recommend it off-hand?
[23:34	<psych>	hwilde, ty, gonna test it
[23:34	<Veinor>	daveg| download the alternate cd ISO and mount it loopback
[23:34	<kbrooks>	cronix, andb initrd, from the tab completion
[23:34	<Darknezz>	amenado: ya. just instaled it yesterday and never used linux besides at school (basics)
[23:35	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: What Version Of Ubuntu do you have?
[23:35	<nucco>	hwilde: I mean the separate /home partition
[23:35	<kbrooks>	cronix, do you understand?
[23:35	<DaveG|>	KooperKool, 7.10
[23:35	<Veinor>	You'll still have to download a huge file but you won't need to make a CD
[23:35	<southafrikanse>	hello. I have a problem with Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 5 on Hardy Heron. I installed the wrong plugin to watch videos on youtube but now I'm unable to remove it.
[23:35	<cronix>	no, root (hd0,2) does not return any errors, but nothing happens either :>
[23:35	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: go to System--Administration--Update Manager
[23:35	<Tristam>	So anyone have ideas on why my sound is horribly distorted after the upgrade?  I've got an Nvidia MCP51 HDA
[23:35	<hwilde>	nucco, if you want to deal with that fine, it's not really much difference
[23:36	<evilbug>	i upgraded to hardy via alternative cd and i had a bunch of errors on some components not being able to install.then i ran "sudo apt-get -f install" after reboot and now things work alright,but the grub boot menu is showing me 2 different ubuntu options.both are 8.04 but one is with the previous kernel and the first one is the current kernel.
[23:36	<hwilde>	nucco, might be easier to switch to aq different repo later on
[23:36	<Crshman>	DBautell, when i try to use the dvd as a source it gives me the error: "E: Unable to locate any package files, perhaps this is not a Debian Disc"
[23:36	<amenado>	Darknezz->	well make a note of that, i noticed it earlier and didnt think much of it,  that line in /etc/hosts has to be corrected..i tried to set that via n-m and know it does not work
[23:36	<cronix>	what is that with initrd? it sais that the kernel must be loaded before
[23:36	<KooperKool>	I dont think HDA is good on Hardy
[23:36	<SirBob1701>	hey guys when i try to update vmware on hardy on my desktop i get " make: *** [vmmon.ko] Error 2 " does anyone know a solution?
[23:36	<josh04>	Tristam: Just an offhand guess, but try going to the mixer and turning PCM down, then up again
[23:36	<nucco>	southafrikanse: check your ~/.firefox folder or wherever firefox hides its settings, you might find something deletable there
[23:36	<DaveG|>	KooperKool, yeah, and then?
[23:36	<GreenFuze>	EruditeHermit: Here is the solution: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=742382
[23:36	<szenti>	Hmm, this new release [8.04] of Ubuntu is more complete than the previous one. I'm glad I can use it. :)
[23:36	<KooperKool>	Click the Check Button
[23:36	<amenado>	cronix->	what are you trying to do?
[23:36	<nucco>	hwilde: yeah, makes it easy to do clean installs without losing data
[23:36	<livingdaylight>	FF3 doesn't allow Delicious bookmarks?
[23:37	<mythic>	i had trouble with vmware on a hardy beta before because the vmware modules would not build on the new kernel
[23:37	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: Click the check button
[23:37	<szenti>	livingdaylight, install firefox-2 ...
[23:37	<roffe__>	unop: it claims I'm a spammer :) can I send the install file to you instaed?
[23:37	<DaveG|>	KooperKool, ok
[23:37	<jaffarkelshac>	got that fixed mythic
[23:37	<southafrikanse>	nucco, if I unnistal and install mozilla again will that help?
[23:37	<hwilde>	nucco, or you could just copy youre /home directory it's really not that hard
[23:37	<unop>	roffe__, use the !pastebin
[23:37	<DBautell>	Crshman, it worked for me by running 'gksudo /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade' from a terminal
[23:37	<unop>	!pastebin >	roffe__
[23:37	<cronix>	i want to boot up ubuntu, but grub shows up an error21 (cant find disks or sth). but i know that ubuntu is on hd0,2 ..
[23:37	<mythic>	awesome
[23:37	<CelticLord>	nuit!!
[23:37	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: when its done, at the top it should say "A New OS is avaible" Or somthing like that
[23:37	<livingdaylight>	szenti, i might have to... Hardy came with FF3 so i been using that, but i'm not sure it is better than FF2. What is the differnce?
[23:37	<roffe__>	unop: yeah, but it says I'm a spammer for doing it three times now :/
[23:38	<DaveG|>	KooperKool, it says it already actually xD
[23:38	<nucco>	southafrikanse: I doubt that, but look in that folder, and if you see something named similar to the offending plugin, remove it.
[23:38	<Darknezz>	amenado: i have one more question when i do install xmms2 it seems to work (in terminal) then when i go to applications i cant find it. when i run it again it says no updated available making it sound like its installed. i also run it (xmms2) and all i get is a list of commands (stop, play, shuffle ect.)

[23:38	<pagoda>	i downgraded to firefox-2 and now i can't open it.

[23:38	<nucco>	hwilde: copying a 100G /home partition isn't something I like to do over and over :)
[23:38	<szenti>	livingdaylight, I've been using FF3 beta5 since a week and I've found out that some extensions are not yet upgraded to support it.
[23:38	<josh04>	Tux2008: ps -a|grep ssh
[23:38	<pagoda>	it says firefox is already running, but i just rebooted
[23:38	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: The 8.04 installation files aren't on a CD unless you downloaded the cd ISO
[23:38	<Darknezz>	amenado: i dont know if im doing somthing wrong or its a bug with xmms2 or ubuntu
[23:38	<Crshman>	DBautell, i just tried that and it says "Failed to add the CD", the error message was: "E: Unable to locate any package files, perhaps this is not a Debian Disc"
[23:38	<Tristam>	josh04, I don't know why, but that seemed to work
[23:38	<ripps>	What's up dawgs!
[23:39	<amenado>	Darknezz->	did the install completed?
[23:39	<Tux2008>	josh04 : thanks a lot!!!

[23:39	<cronix>	i think that it is just a wrong link in the grub config, cause i had ubuntu installed before. but when i use root (hd0,2) ... nothing happens, i need one more command like "boot this shit :)"
[23:39	<Darknezz>	amenado: ya
[23:39	<josh04>	Tristam: No idea either, but it worked for me too :P

[23:39	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: oh! Why didn't you say so. Just burn it to A CD, then boot to it.
[23:39	<szenti>	I think it can be managed to work on Ubuntu as well.

[23:40	<nucco>	n000b: you really gotta define "better"
[23:40	<DBautell>	Crshman, that makes me wonder if it's a bad burn or if having the CD on a DVD is confusing to the system... I used the DVD image... You are using alternate? and, is your system otherwise up to date?

[23:41	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: Then you have to update from the update manager or go out and buy some CD-Rs.

[23:47	<ahboy>	lol
[23:47	<n000b>	can anyone tell me what the disadvantages are to xubuntu?
[23:47	<nucco>	seamus7: you could mount the iso to any folder in your /home
[23:47	<nucco>	n000b: it's a matter of choice or preference
[23:47	<darkcrab>	just so you know other flash works, its just you tube
[23:47	<yoni>	Fogel1497: I hapy to know that you had :) How can I solve it as well?
[23:47	<n000b>	nucco: but whats the difference?
[23:47	<seamus7>	nucco: I'm only referring to the message B166erx included ... looks like the drive was attempting to mount in that particular directory ...
[23:48	<drivetrax>	Just YouTube. OMG.. I'm falling out!
[23:48	<Danikar>	n000b: The GUI is less resource intesive.
[23:48	<nucco>	darkcrab: have you tried that pulse-audio volume manager?
[23:48	<Fogel1497>	YONI I PM'd you. Visit this link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[23:48	<psych>	hwilde, didnt work
[23:48	<ripps>	n000b: Xubuntu using XFCE desktop instead of Gnome, it's more lightweight. It more of a desktop preference
[23:48	<masterjail>	anyone knows in which file the settings of the login screen are?
[23:48	<Fogel1497>	﻿YONI I PM'd you. Visit this link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[23:48	<darkcrab>	doing it now.
[23:48	<Danikar>	n000b: But imo not as nice, but as darkcrab said matter of preference.
[23:48	<nucco>	n000b: you gotta try it to really know. I'm too used to GNOME/Ubuntu to try anything else on my own
[23:48	<darkcrab>	brb
[23:48	<yoni>	Fogel1497: thanks a lot!!! :)
[23:48	<Fogel1497>	NP!
[23:48	<milly1234>	please, I know someone here might be using a good wireless card with ubuntu 8.04, one that works well, at full speed, no problems, that sort of stuff, I am trying to find one that will work unlike the one I have, which worked in 7.10 but now is terrible in 8.04
[23:48	<doug2266778822>	moveax: you find any thing yet?
[23:48	<n000b>	how do i switch to XFCE?
[23:49	<KooperKool>	!xfce | n000b
[23:49	<ubotu>	n000b: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of !GNOME. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/ - To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop » - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
[23:49	<J-a-k-e>	hi does about sound quality and ubuntu?
[23:49	<Steve^>	How can I make more than 4 partitions on a disk?
[23:49	<B166erx>	seamus7 ok , getting weirder now : the HD are accesible from the 'Workstation' (I use ubuntu in french, so traducing ) its there and called 'Media 40.1 gig'  (so is my other 'Media 320 gig' ) wich both used to be called respectively, Windows' and 'Barracuda'  and showed on the desktop.
[23:49	<nucco>	steve^ make them inside a logical partition, then you can have up to 64
[23:49	<storm-zen>	is there a place on this server to go for assistance with a simple legal statement?
[23:49	<ripps>	J-a-k-e: What's wrong with your sound quality?
[23:49	<n000b>	brb
[23:49	<Steve^>	nucco, I make a logical one and it just takes up all the space, do I need to make it of a certain type?
[23:50	<zeeeee>	help, i got a major problem!  after trying to upgrade, it failed, told me my system may be in an "unusable state", and now after rebooting, gnome won't start (i just see a tan wallpaper and nothing else)
[23:50	<pagoda>	has anyone downgraded to firefox 2 in hardy?
[23:50	<hwilde>	zeeeee, ctrl+alt+f1   go to terminal
[23:50	<zeeeee>	*it = the update process
[23:50	<nucco>	Steve^ you make a logical one, then make the others inside of the logical one
[23:50	<zeeeee>	hwilde, i'm there
[23:50	<zeeeee>	hwilde, i ran:
[23:50	<KooperKool>	zeeeee: Did you use Wubi?
[23:50	<zeeeee>	dpkg --configure -a
[23:50	<hwilde>	zeeeee, just run "apt-get upgrade"
[23:50	<nucco>	Steve^ think of the logical one as just a container. don't need a type
[23:50	<zeeeee>	KooperKool, perhaps not, what is it?
[23:51	<moveax>	doug2266778822: I've asked a local mailing group of mine who I met up with yesterday. During the meeting they suggested Ubuntu as it, "justs works." So, I'm putting their expert (most of them are Dr's of IT) to the test.
[23:51	<zeeeee>	hwilde, that tells me to run dpkg --configure -a
[23:51	<KooperKool>	!Wubi | zeeeee
[23:51	<ubotu>	zeeeee: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php for troubleshooting. Please file bugs at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug.
[23:51	<zeeeee>	KooperKool, no i'm upgrading from 7.10
[23:51	<hwilde>	zeeeee, ok what does that tell you
[23:51	<Steve^>	nucco, I'm doing this from inside the installer, I don't see how to make a logical without a type, nor how to add to a logical partition
[23:51	<zeeeee>	hwilde, i'll paste..
[23:51	<hwilde>	zeeeee, pastebin!
[23:51	<roffe__>	unop: If you've given up, I can more than well understand it :)
[23:51	<hwilde>	!pastebin | zeeeee
[23:51	<ubotu>	zeeeee: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[23:51	<B166erx>	seamus7 , and in the 'File system'   in /media there is 2 folder called 'Disk' and Disk-1 , which contains my Hard drives files
[23:51	<Steve^>	nucco, perhaps I make all my partions as "logical" and it'll figure it out itself?
[23:51	<B166erx>	'weirder'
[23:51	<KooperKool>	zeeeee: It crashed my Ubuntu and my Windows. I bascially had to wipe my harsd drive
[23:51	<nucco>	Steve^ please explain what you're trying to accomplish
[23:52	<unop>	roffe__, not given up, just reading up on this .. well, from http://kin.klever.net/napkin/requirements i assume you need to do this. sudo aptitude install libgtkmm-dev libsqlite3-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool
=== aib is now known as _aib
[23:52	<zeeeee>	KooperKool, i'm sorry to hear that!
[23:52	<harfg>	any one using flumotion successfully with hardy?
[23:52	<drivetrax>	Steve^:  if You see a partition, hit enter.. on it, and then tell it what to partition, and keep doing that until you get the /swap and all of them partitioned
[23:52	<Steve^>	nucco, I have 80 gigs. I want 2 gig swap, 30 gig for / and 50 for /home, but I only have 2 partitions left. you're right that I need a logical partition, but I don't see how I get this tool to do it
[23:52	<Cpudan80>	pagoda: It is in there already
[23:52	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Alright, well, the dhclient gave them six different "dhcpdiscover eth0 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval" and at the end it said "no dhcpoffers received"
[23:52	<zeeeee>	KooperKool, i have 2 machines, both ubuntu 7.10, both had problems upgrading to 8.04 (and they were different problems)
[23:53	<hwilde>	fxfitz, lan cable is unplugged, dsl modem needs rebooted, etc etc
[23:53	<jaffarkelshac>	what video editors are there for hardy, that support ogg file format
[23:53	<drivetrax>	Steve^:  -- hover over the logical drive name you see, and hit enter
[23:53	<Steve^>	drivetrax, since you mention swap, is 2 gigs enough?
[23:53	<J-a-k-e>	ripps: ubuntu 7.10, it's working alright the prob is it only just sounds "ok" to me. I'm quite picky with my sound, music sound as if the mids are exagerated and treble is flat cymbals and such sound as if they're in the background
[23:53	<adinc>	can someone please tell me which kernel-version is the newest for hardy?
[23:53	<nucco>	steve, delete "/" and "/home" then create a logical partition big enough to hold them both
[23:53	<n000b>	once i install xubuntu can i revert back to ubuntu?
[23:53	<B166erx>	seamus7 , also ( ;) ) , the Mount app ofthe task bar, lists 2 times, bothe my drives, on time as '300gig' mounted, and on time as 'Barracuda' 'not mounted' (same for the windows one)
[23:53	<nucco>	Steve^: make the swap first though
[23:53	<Sindacious>	Could anyone tell me why I can't download packages -.-
[23:53	<drivetrax>	nucco:  -- yes.. right
[23:53	<nucco>	Steve^ delete "/" and "/home" then create a logical partition big enough to hold them both
[23:53	<seamus7>	B166erx ... have you looked in gconf editor ... I think it's listed in apps/nautilus/desktop ... make sure 'volumes visible' is checked
[23:53	<jaffarkelshac>	adinc,  2.6.24-16
[23:53	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Okay, and you're sure that would be it? Because the modem is really hard to get to and I don't want them going into the attic if they don't have to (I already had them check the ethernet cable in the back of the computer)
[23:54	<B166erx>	ok
[23:54	<Cpudan80>	Sindacious: the server is very slow - give it time
[23:54	<roffe__>	unop: I think I had checked that they were installed from the beginning, but I'll run your command now
[23:54	<Cpudan80>	Sindacious: we just released 8.04 yesterday
[23:54	<doug2266778822>	moveax:  ah cool, i just uninstalled and reinstalled still getting same thing.
[23:54	<hwilde>	fxfitz, are there more than one network cards?  like eth1 ?
[23:54	<n000b>	once u install xubuntu can u revert back to ubuntu?
[23:54	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Nope
[23:54	<hwilde>	fxfitz, dhclient eth0   should get a dhcp address from whatever it's plugged into
[23:54	<drivetrax>	nucco:  -- I don't think the thing is too easy to see, but I hit enter on the logical disk name, and it started needing partitions
[23:54	<ripps>	J-a-k-e: Have checked in the Volume Control preferences for a Tone option. I had to enable Tone in my SBLive! 5.1 to mess with my Bass and Treble. Just turning Tone on improved sound quality.
[23:54	<adinc>	jaffarkelshac: can users expect newer kernel versions for hardy and will it be installed when saying dist-upgrade
[23:54	<Steve^>	nucco, drivetrax, I make my 80 gig parition, Logical (it forces me to select a type, so I select ext3), hitting enter on it just gives the "Edit parition" box. Do I need to do this outside of the installer in gparted?
[23:54	<B166erx>	seamus7, Volume Visible was checked
[23:54	<seamus7>	B166erx just do ALT +F2 and type gconf ... then it's apps/nautilus/desktop
[23:54	<unop>	roffe__,  if thats the case, try this instead.  sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgtkmm-dev libsqlite3-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool
[23:54	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Alright, well it sounds good. Thanks a lot1
[23:54	<hwilde>	fxfitz, have them do "sudo ifconfig eth0 down"  "sudo ifconfig eth0 up"  "sudo dhclient eth0"
[23:54	<seamus7>	B166erx oh nevermind
[23:54	<moveax>	doug2266778822: I have this irssi session screened on a remote server, so if you like, keep checking back with me and I@ll let you know how I got on. Already got one reply, but it doesn't help.
[23:55	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Okay will do
[23:55	<KooperKool>	what happens if I Remove ubuntu-desktop?
[23:55	<jaffarkelshac>	adinc, usually gets installed by update manager
[23:55	<pmcclelland>	having trouble playing .mkv files they are running pretty choppy
[23:55	<doug2266778822>	moveax: how i join the irrsi?
[23:55	<nucco>	do you already have some windows partitions?
[23:55	<pmcclelland>	using nvidia proprietary drivers
[23:55	<Joelito>	Hi, I notice the icon effect while pushing the icons on the upper panel of ubuntu hardy, can I enable that effect on the menu items?
[23:55	<zeeeee>	hwilde, http://rafb.net/p/agfzmf24.html
[23:55	<nucco>	Steve^ do you already have some windows partitions?
[23:55	<pmcclelland>	8800 GT
[23:55	<n000b>	once u install xubuntu can u revert back to ubuntu?
[23:55	<hwilde>	Steve^, just use guided partitioning man!
[23:55	<adinc>	final version of hardy has been released, are the updates going to be less frequent now
[23:55	<Steve^>	nucco, yup, a fat16 and a ntfs
[23:55	<thompa>	has there been an update since yesaterday?
[23:55	<drivetrax>	Steve^:  -- I believe it is saying.. do you want to make this an ext3 partition, and to do that you Edit the partition, and Make it a Partition of that type
[23:55	<moveax>	doug2266778822: haha, you don't, it's an irc client.
[23:56	<moveax>	doug2266778822: btw, the gstreamer driver, i've just noticed, doesn't include dvd playback of encrypted dvds
[23:56	<nucco>	Steve^, those also count as part of the 4 maximum you can have.
[23:56	<ripps>	brb
=== liberfiasco is now known as libervisco
=== jani__ is now known as _Jani_
[23:56	<Steve^>	nucco, yea, I know
[23:56	<zeeeee>	those are the errors i'm getting
[23:56	<Sindacious>	Cpudan80, obviously. I just updated to it, and I'm getting lag from nowhere, and I cannot install anything through the Add/Remove
[23:56	<nucco>	Steve^, so, you gotta delete all the linux partitions you have, and make them all inside a logical partition
[23:56	<zeeeee>	dpkg basically crashes with a failed assertion after a bunch of failed attempts to configure packages
[23:56	<hwilde>	zeeeee, sudo apt-get install x11-xfs-utils
[23:57	<Joelito>	anyone?
=== wwalker is now known as wwalker_away
[23:57	<nucco>	Steve^ delete them all including the swap, then make a new logical partition with all the space, see what it gives you
[23:57	<Steve^>	nucco, yea, but the tool won't let me make logical partitions. I'm going to try and make all swap, / and /home as "logical" and see if that works
[23:57	<thompa>	firefox is causing my screen to lock up
[23:57	<seamus7>	B166erx when I plug media cards in they get mounted twice ... so I don't know what's happening there
[23:57	<nucco>	Steve^ you gotta delete the existing ones first, just leaving the two windows partitions you dont want to touch
[23:57	<doug2266778822>	moveax: ah ok
[23:58	<zeeeee>	hwilde, that just tells me to run dpkg --configure -a
[23:58	<nucco>	Steve^ the logical partition also counts as part of the 4 maximum :)
[23:58	<ethana2>	Got a problem with intel pro wireless 3945 abg network adapter
[23:58	<ethana2>	not seeing any networks
[23:58	<Steve^>	nucco, I  have the 80 gigs of free space. I select logical and it appears to just make it as a normal parition. There is nothing in the table to indicate it is logical
[23:58	<ethana2>	suspected driver bug
[23:58	<hwilde>	zeeeee, sorry that's way over my head.  you need to install those things that says "Package x11-xfs-utils is not installed"  bcause the other things depend on it
[23:58	<B166erx>	Seamus7 i think i'm trying to 'get it' ..Ubuntu, while trying to make it simple, just keep Frakkin up everything for old timers like me.  Instead of having to go in Fstab, create a folder in /media, ect...   Hardy auto mount and detect the drives...and simply name them 'Media  **gig'     , But since i upgraded, i still have the Fstab lines and all, maybe thats it..
[23:58	<ethana2>	i'm helping a guy out, his wireless isn't working, but there's no sensical reason for that
[23:58	<nucco>	Steve^ when you make logical, that gives you 3 partitions including the windows ones right?
[23:59	<hansengel>	Hi, I just updated to Hardy and for some reason the sound is REALLY quiet.
[23:59	<roffe__>	unop: I did both the commands you gave me now, and still an error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64444/
[23:59	<hansengel>	If I raise the volume to the highest it can go, it's a normal level
[23:59	<zeeeee>	hwilde, yeah, i read the messages too, but the upgrade process was completely hosed
[23:59	<hansengel>	My speakers are as high as they can go also
[23:59	<nucco>	ethana2: explain the problem please, better chances of getting help that way
[23:59	<zeeeee>	http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/222096 is what happened
[23:59	<Steve^>	nucco, yea, its working like I thought. You don't make a logical partition. You make them all with the "logical" option, it assigned them to sda5,6,7 and it'll make the logical bit for you
[23:59	<KooperKool>	What happens if I remove ubuntu-desktop?
[23:59	<KrimZon>	what's that acpi script in hardy where you can enable/disable laptop-mode?
[23:59	<hwilde>	KooperKool, what do you think man?  it uninstalls the desktop
[23:59	<Steve^>	nucco, its trying to be user friendly and therefore confusing people who know what they want
[23:59	<josh04>	KooperKool: nothing, it's a meta-pack

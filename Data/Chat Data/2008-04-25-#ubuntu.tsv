[neutral]	[00:00]	<ubuntuROX>	its waiting on you t accept it.
[negative]	[00:00]	<f0rmat>	may i ask exactly who are the coders of ubuntu are they just everyone or anyone?
[negative]	[00:00]	<cygoku>	goat|work ... Windows is not there at all anymore, I installed over it
[negative]	[00:00]	<barslow>	x1250: wasnt able to actually get into ubuntu and I dont know enough terminal to diagnose
[positive]	[00:00]	<oddalot>	ubuntoROX it won't let me send private msgs on this server, don't know if that will affect sending files as well
[negative]	[00:00]	<RyanPrior>	matt____: If the LiveCD doesn't work, it's likely to be a graphics card driver problem.
[negative]	[00:00]	<goat|work>	cygoku: oh
[negative]	[00:00]	<Saladin>	Oh wow!
[positive]	[00:00]	<ubuntuROX>	have an email address?
[neutral]	[00:00]	<Saladin>	Auto 3D windows
[negative]	[00:00]	<PePa>	will I need to boot from the alt.CD, or can I just ...
[neutral]	[00:00]	<oddalot>	oddalot@yahoo.com
[neutral]	[00:00]	<maco>	PePa: no just have to mount it and add it as a repository
[negative]	[00:00]	<goat|work>	cygoku: yes, then if you have,  sure
[positive]	[00:00]	<tanath>	f0rmat, you can find more info about that on launchpad.net
[neutral]	[00:00]	<dragao-azul>	how can graphics card problems be solved in the live cd?
[negative]	[00:01]	<Fishscene>	Who had the pink window problem in this screenshot? @HLINK
[neutral]	[00:01]	<f0rmat>	tanath, thankyou
[positive]	[00:01]	<barslow>	RyanPrior: One last question, I have compiz and all my themes setup just the way I like them, will they stay the same after the uprgrade (I'm using AWN with modified Mac4lin and Compiz is all set perfect)
[neutral]	[00:01]	<matt____>	"RyanPrior: perhaps...but 7.10 is working fine. how could i check/fix though? the live cd takes me to a ""busybox"", not a normal terminal."
[neutral]	[00:01]	<x1250>	barslow: /var/log/Xorg.0.log is the place to look, or ~/.xsession-errors
[positive]	[00:01]	<goat|work>	cygoku: i wont be able to watch the channel, so if you have more q's message me
[neutral]	[00:01]	<arbrandes>	"dragao-azul, use ""safe graphics mode"""
[negative]	[00:01]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, any advice?
[negative]	[00:01]	<tanath>	barslow, should be no change
[neutral]	[00:01]	<cygoku>	goat|work ... Thank you, and sorry for my rudeness earlier
[negative]	[00:01]	<barslow>	hmm
[negative]	[00:01]	<PePa>	OK
[negative]	[00:01]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: I'd just about bet that something will break and you'll spend hours reconfiguring things. Upgrades tend to mess with your stuff.
[neutral]	[00:01]	<dragao-azul>	abrandes, then how can i solve the problems? make my ati card work fine?
[positive]	[00:01]	<PePa>	thanks Maco
[neutral]	[00:01]	<maco>	Fishscene: nvidia driver quality
[neutral]	[00:01]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, did you answer my  last question?
[neutral]	[00:01]	<kilrae>	can you mount an encrypted lvm in Vista?
[neutral]	[00:01]	<tanath>	barslow, actually..
[negative]	[00:01]	<oddalot>	i wonder how nerdy it would be if all these 1500 people where in a room at one time
[negative]	[00:01]	<sileni>	"he i installed build essential and tried to ""make"" but i get this error @HLINK"
[negative]	[00:02]	<ubuntuROX>	there you go,, thats the one thats set for resolution auto,  it should work for you.
[neutral]	[00:02]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, are you able to get a DHCP IP from the router?
[negative]	[00:02]	<barslow>	ryanprior: im just gunna stick with gutsy then
[negative]	[00:02]	<maco>	barslow: should stay, yes
[neutral]	[00:02]	<glaxo>	"tcpdumpgod, no - i get ""No DHCPOFFERS received"""
[negative]	[00:02]	<oddalot>	ok thanks, let me try it
[neutral]	[00:02]	<ubuntuROX>	modes anyhow
[neutral]	[00:02]	<barslow>	wow conflicting opinions
[negative]	[00:02]	<tanath>	barslow, it may switch to the new default theme, but you can save your current theme/settings, and switch back after upgrade
[neutral]	[00:02]	<Jimdb>	matt___try a different CD reader...try adding ide=nodma on command line when you boot into the installer.
[positive]	[00:02]	<RyanPrior>	oddalot: That's the Ubuntu Live conference. :-)
[negative]	[00:02]	<laeg>	barslow: stick with gutsy forever?
[negative]	[00:02]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, do you know your routers ip address? 192.168.1.1?
[neutral]	[00:02]	<matt____>	"RyanPrior: perhaps...but 7.10 is working fine. how could i check/fix though? the live cd takes me to a ""busybox"", not a normal terminal."
[neutral]	[00:02]	<sileni>	i dont understand how to change the flags
[neutral]	[00:02]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, 192.168.0.1
[negative]	[00:02]	<tanath>	barslow, i didn't have that problem though
[neutral]	[00:02]	<sileni>	like that error states
[negative]	[00:02]	<barslow>	laeg: i dont want to but i dont wanna risk having to reformat my HD again
[negative]	[00:02]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, are you using KDE or Gnome?
[neutral]	[00:02]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, gnome
[negative]	[00:02]	<Fishscene>	"Maco: it looked like the ""mirror"" or ""shadow"" (I forgot which) option in Compiz could fix that issue (Disabling the mirror or shadow effects)"
[negative]	[00:03]	<oddalot>	RyanPriot: Where is this ubuntu live conference?
[negative]	[00:03]	<mohbana>	can i install ubuntu from a ntfs? without the wubi thing? i don't have a dvd to burn it on
[neutral]	[00:03]	<oddalot>	err when too
[negative]	[00:03]	<maco>	barslow: your compiz settings will be saved.  there are more features in the new compiz though, so you might want to explore them after you upgrade
[positive]	[00:03]	<basso>	I Love You All!
[negative]	[00:03]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, have you tried setting your IP to 192.168.0.100, your netmask to 255.255.255.0, and your gateway to 192.168.0.1?
[positive]	[00:03]	<tanath>	barslow, there's always a risk when upgrading. personally, it fixed a lot of stuff for me, and i had minimal issues
[positive]	[00:03]	<matt____>	RyanPrior: well, what would i search google for to fix this graphics card setting?
[neutral]	[00:03]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, I have (with 192.168.0.200) as .100 is already taken
[negative]	[00:03]	<tanath>	barslow, and none of my settings in anything changed
[neutral]	[00:03]	<ubuntuROX>	I think its faster than gutsy was.
[negative]	[00:03]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: It's certainly possible that you could upgrade and have everything work perfectly - the Ubuntu developers certainly try hard to make that happen. You can't bet on it, though.
[positive]	[00:03]	<Flannel>	mohbana: there are ways to install without burning, check it out: @HLINK
[neutral]	[00:03]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, is 192.168.0.101 taken?
[neutral]	[00:03]	<oddalot>	brb
[neutral]	[00:04]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, yes
[neutral]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	Hm.
[neutral]	[00:04]	<LOVElinux>	salve a tutti!
[positive]	[00:04]	<RyanPrior>	matt____: Google and the Ubuntu Forums are good places to search.
[positive]	[00:04]	<DBautell>	"heh, ""select best server"" ""no suitable server was found"""
[positive]	[00:04]	<tanath>	yeah, it's faster :D
[negative]	[00:04]	<barslow>	tanath: i am correct in assuming if I run the live-cd and have no issues that the upgrade will work?
[neutral]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, do that now...
[negative]	[00:04]	<maco>	RyanPrior: given my hardware, id take that bet
[negative]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	I am unable, for some reason, to install any extensions.
[neutral]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	set your ip to 192.168.0.101
[neutral]	[00:04]	<barslow>	RyanPrior: same question
[positive]	[00:04]	<RyanPrior>	matt____: If you can get a hold of Amaranth, he/she tends to know a lot about graphics card issues as well.
[negative]	[00:04]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, i have tried a manual set up through gnomes network manager and through /etc/network/interfaces and it still doesnt work
[neutral]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	netmask: 255.255.255.0
[negative]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	Sorry for being a pain - first upgrade.
[negative]	[00:04]	<tanath>	barslow, that should be the case, though i've seen the livecd not work, and the install work...
[positive]	[00:04]	<Cpudan80>	Anyone know why I can't play 2 sounds at the same time?
[neutral]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, check your PMs
[neutral]	[00:04]	<maco>	barslow: im using my compiz settings from feisty
[negative]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	And I mean, extensions in Firefox.
[negative]	[00:04]	<ubuntuROX>	make sure that FF3 is completely shut down before starting ff2
[positive]	[00:04]	<maco>	barslow: it works fine
[neutral]	[00:04]	<matt____>	RyanPrior: ok, thanks
[neutral]	[00:04]	<barslow>	tanath: interesting
[positive]	[00:04]	<ng01>	saladin.  ur such a pain... :)
[negative]	[00:04]	<romulo>	hi, i installed the fglrx driver on ati but fgl_glxgears is not working and 3d apps are generally slow (like q3 in this super machine), can anyone hlelp me?
[negative]	[00:04]	<dragao-azul>	"if i install ubuntu is there any ""easy"" way to get my ATI HD2900Pro card working with all the graphics effects?"
[neutral]	[00:05]	<x1250>	Cpudan80: upgrading from gutsy?
[positive]	[00:05]	<Cpudan80>	like ehh if I am using rhythmbox and xchat at the same time - and I get pinged in xchat, I wont hear the ping
[negative]	[00:05]	<Cpudan80>	x1250: Yeah - just did
[negative]	[00:05]	<ubuntuROX>	Saladin,, make sure FF3 is completely shut down before starting FF2
[negative]	[00:05]	<ben-g>	i enabled my wireless in restricted drivers. Why won't it work?
[neutral]	[00:05]	<tanath>	barslow, there can be issues running of a disc. it's slower for one
[negative]	[00:05]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: No, the LiveCD is not proof positive that the upgrade will work. The upgrade is affected by all the changes and customizations you make, so some of those may be messed with and you'll have to reconfigure things the way you want them.
[negative]	[00:05]	<matt____>	Amaranth: hey buddy...after trying the 8.04 live cd (kubuntu and ubuntu), neither boots, both take me to a busybox, could this be a graphics issue?
[neutral]	[00:05]	<igormorgado>	is there any kernel difference between server/desktop  editions?
[neutral]	[00:05]	<x1250>	Cpudan80: try installing pulseaudio
[neutral]	[00:05]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, check your private messages
[neutral]	[00:05]	<mad_max02>	Would it be smart to go for update to hardy or is a clean install better choice ???
[negative]	[00:05]	<maco>	romulo: are you using fglrx on a card that is so old its not supported with taght driver? thats the symptoms i saw when opensuse tried to use that driver on a radeon 9250
[neutral]	[00:05]	<barslow>	I'm real nervous about upgrading
[neutral]	[00:05]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, I cant reply as im not registered - let me register
[negative]	[00:05]	<ubuntuROX>	otherwise you are still actually running FF3,, same thing happens the other way.
[neutral]	[00:05]	<tanath>	dragao-azul, run 'gksu displayconfig-gtk'
[positive]	[00:05]	<igormorgado>	omg.. the chanel is very busy today, more than usual =D
[negative]	[00:05]	<matt____>	mad_max02: i alwaws clean install. the only time i tried updating, it didn't work right :(*
[negative]	[00:05]	<x1250>	Cpudan80: then configure pulseaudio to be used in system->prefs->sound
[positive]	[00:05]	<romulo>	maco, my card is supported, its an x600 mobility
[positive]	[00:05]	<barslow>	i finally have ubuntu exactly how i like it
[negative]	[00:05]	<tcpdumpgod>	okay glaxo
[negative]	[00:06]	<Cpudan80>	x1250: I'll give it a shot - thanks
[neutral]	[00:06]	<dragao-azul>	tanath, after that will it work fine? i don't have to do anything else?
[positive]	[00:06]	<Fishscene>	Conventional wisdom dictates that clean installs are always better (and cleaner) than upgrades
[positive]	[00:06]	<ubuntuROX>	my ubuntu is so how I like it its booring now :)
[positive]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: If you have it exactly how you want it, no pressure to upgrade! It's still supported for many months.
[negative]	[00:06]	<gnuskoo1>	barslow: go on, it'll be alright, or fun sorting it out
[neutral]	[00:06]	<igormorgado>	is there any kernel difference between server/desktop  editions?
[neutral]	[00:06]	<tanath>	dragao-azul, to configure X right. then run 'glxinfo | grep -i direct' to check for direct rendering
[negative]	[00:06]	<mad_max02>	matt____, thanks dude. I'll dl the 64 bit ver and install it tomorrow.
[negative]	[00:06]	<iDano84>	ok, I got Ubuntu discs in the mail today. I'm the first to admit, I know little to know little to nothing about linux. When I pop in the disc (v 7.10 x64) I select install Ubuntu, and then loss of video input. I Have no idea where to start?
[negative]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: If it's perfect right now, then it's only downhill from here, right?
[negative]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	igormorgado: Nope, same kernel.
[negative]	[00:06]	<teo->	i need some help.. when i try to start ubuntu it doesn't start.. some busybox shell is started please help ?:S
[positive]	[00:06]	<igormorgado>	RyanPrior: thank you
[negative]	[00:06]	<tanath>	dragao-azul, there's a 'test' button to make sure you have it configured right, but after that, it should be good
[neutral]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	igormorgado: Same kernel, same packages, same tool chain, etc.
[negative]	[00:06]	<pale-yafa>	guys, I have no firebug any more, cant work like that, why this is not mentioned?
[negative]	[00:07]	<Saladin>	Yeah, I made sure FF3 was shut down, but still no success in installing extensions
[positive]	[00:07]	<RyanPrior>	pale-yafa: Firebug works.
[negative]	[00:07]	<gnuskoo1>	igormorgado: no, server has no desktop only
[negative]	[00:07]	<dragao-azul>	tanath, ok, thz i'm going to try that
[neutral]	[00:07]	<tanath>	Saladin, still having trouble with extensions? did you try that extension i mentioned?
[neutral]	[00:07]	<ubuntuROX>	wierd,, you went to terminal and ran ps ax|grep firefox
[neutral]	[00:07]	<maco>	pale-yafa: firebug 1.2
[negative]	[00:07]	<barslow>	RyanPrior: agreed
[negative]	[00:07]	<pretender>	koverartist I cant select case in ubntu.  Any Ideas
[neutral]	[00:07]	<pale-yafa>	RyanPrior: its not, I upgraded to 8.4 and its telling me  its not compitable
[negative]	[00:07]	<Saladin>	Sorry tanath, I missed what you said.
[neutral]	[00:07]	<james_>	how long would the online update to 8.04 take?
[neutral]	[00:07]	<maco>	pale-yafa: firebug 1.2
[negative]	[00:07]	<Dason>	So..... what do I do if I can't download and install 8.04 if it won't work through the 'recommended' way?
[neutral]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, no you didn't
[negative]	[00:08]	<joh6nn>	i'm not quite sure how to explain this properly, but whenever i use screen, apps like vim, that do their own paging, don't clear the screen properly.  i'm fairly certain that i just need to tell screen to pretend it's a different terminal, but i don't know which terminal to tell it to be.  anyone have ideas?
[negative]	[00:08]	<barslow>	i think i'll wait untill there are a couple updates to 8.04 b4 taking the plunge
[neutral]	[00:08]	<maco>	pale-yafa: you need to update your firebug
[negative]	[00:08]	<ubuntuROX>	just to make absolutely sure it was shut down?
[neutral]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, was a while ago. you acknowledged it
[negative]	[00:08]	<dee_cz>	hi, im running the memtest from ubuntu cd, how long should it take?
[positive]	[00:08]	<igormorgado>	gnuskoo1: thank you too =D
[neutral]	[00:08]	<cygoku>	Using Hardy Heron RC here ... Are the repos down ??
[neutral]	[00:08]	<maco>	cygoku: of course
[neutral]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, nightly tester tools extension
[neutral]	[00:08]	<ubuntuROX>	yes,, but cygoku did you update recently?
[negative]	[00:08]	<gnuskoo1>	i got thinkpad r51 and gnome is really sluggish on xfce, any hints? intel 82528 graphics card
[neutral]	[00:08]	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: It will take forever, literally. It keeps running until you tell it to stop.
[positive]	[00:08]	<cygoku>	"Maco : ""of course"" ??"
[neutral]	[00:08]	<barslow>	ryanprior: can you choose to install8.04 without Firefox beta3
[positive]	[00:08]	<maco>	cygoku: its release day for a very popular distro.  what makes you think they could survive that?
[negative]	[00:08]	<Fishscene>	All Servers for Hardy Heron are bogged down at the moment and likely will be for at least another day.
[negative]	[00:08]	<Dason>	what do I do if I can't download and install 8.04 if it won't work through the 'recommended' way?
[negative]	[00:08]	<teo->	i need some help.. when i try to start ubuntu it doesn't start.. some busybox shell is started please help ?:S
[negative]	[00:08]	<Flannel>	igormorgado, RyanPrior: There are kernel differences.  They have different hardware support (non-server is more likely to support 'regular' obscure hardware), and server has PREEMPT turned off, among other changes.  Of course, you can run a server kernel on the desktop, or a generic kernel on a server.
[positive]	[00:08]	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: The longer it runs without errors, the more sure you are that you don't have faulty memory. :-)
[positive]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, makes firefox think your extensions are compatible. but i recommend enabling them one at a time
[negative]	[00:09]	<matt____>	Amaranth: hey buddy...after trying the 8.04 live cd (kubuntu and ubuntu), neither boots, both take me to a busybox, could this be a graphics issue?
[neutral]	[00:09]	<maco>	cygoku: this happened last time too.
[negative]	[00:09]	<dee_cz>	RyanPrior: do you know what is the 'safe' margin? how long should it run so that i can say it probably isnt the memory?
[negative]	[00:09]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: Nope, distro upgrades are all-or-nothing affairs pretty much.
[positive]	[00:09]	<tanath>	Saladin, 'cause some will work, and some won't, and some may prevent it from running
[negative]	[00:09]	<ubuntuROX>	michael If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo grub-update to fix that.
[negative]	[00:09]	<cygoku>	I think they can survive that because nothing should affect the linux image
[neutral]	[00:09]	<Dason>	what are other methods of installing 8.04?
[negative]	[00:09]	<ubuntuROX>	cygoku If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo grub-update to fix that.
[negative]	[00:09]	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: If you're seriously suspicious about your memory, I'd run it for a few hours to get your memory really hot and loaded.
[neutral]	[00:09]	<igormorgado>	Flannel: I wish to know if desktop one has virtualization support.
[negative]	[00:09]	<maco>	"cygoku: last time the entire ubuntu.com was taken down and replaced with a plain white background, black text ""welcome to ubuntu.com here's a list of download links:"" page"
[neutral]	[00:09]	<gnuskoo1>	teo-: what messages you getting?
[positive]	[00:09]	<cwillu>	pale-yafa, this is kinda scary:  you need to use firebug, but you can't be bothered to check getfirebug.com, where it lists a version of firebug that works with ff3? ;p
[neutral]	[00:09]	<DBautell>	dason, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. To mount the ISO you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[neutral]	[00:09]	<tmccrary>	So.... Hardy breaks eclipse
[negative]	[00:09]	<tanath>	Saladin, if you end up enabling a bad one that prevents it from running, then run an older firefox to fix it
[positive]	[00:09]	<tmccrary>	Fantastic
[neutral]	[00:10]	<tanath>	Saladin, (ie., disable that extension)
[negative]	[00:10]	<DBautell>	Dason, or did you mean a fresh install?
[neutral]	[00:10]	<maco>	Dason: whats the recommended way that you cant do?
[positive]	[00:10]	<dee_cz>	RyanPrior: its that xp is turning sound from the card into a squeal and gives a bsod every other day, with no specific error... but the 8.04 runs fine :/
[neutral]	[00:10]	<Saladin>	Well, strangely enough, tanath, that extension installed okay.
[neutral]	[00:10]	<RyanPrior>	tmccrary: Eclipse is not well supported on Ubuntu. However, I downloaded the latest Eclipse and run it from my /home folder, and it runs fine.
[positive]	[00:10]	<Dason>	the update manager
[positive]	[00:10]	<Saladin>	Whereas all others aren't.
[positive]	[00:10]	<tanath>	Saladin, the nightly tester tools? of course ;)
[negative]	[00:10]	<jrabbit>	ok
[positive]	[00:10]	<tmccrary>	RyanPrior: Thanks for the tip. It ran great with Gutsy....
[positive]	[00:10]	<Fishscene>	My hats off to Hardy Heron! Built in VMware support? How cool is that?
[negative]	[00:10]	<Dason>	I don't want a fresh install
[neutral]	[00:10]	<jrabbit>	It errored for the third time
[negative]	[00:10]	<teo->	gnuskoo1 i don't get anything i am just putted in the busybox shell
[negative]	[00:11]	<pale-yafa>	cwillu: how would I know thats its there? I just got a message that firefox beta does not support firebug, maybe it should say THIS VIRSION of firebug
[positive]	[00:11]	<rich_freecomm>	heh, never download the desktop iso and the aleternate iso then try to update manager the new release.....it's gonna take me awhile :)
[positive]	[00:11]	<DirkGently>	hey Fujitsu: tested Kubuntu on my laptop... the bcm43xx works fine... the PC even picks up my wireless router now without manual config... it was worth waiting a day :)
[positive]	[00:11]	<maco>	Dason: whats the way that you cant install? we cant recommend alternatives without knowing what it was

[neutral]	[00:11]	<jrabbit>	Repeats
[negative]	[00:11]	<RyanPrior>	pale-yafa: That's true. A better error message would be helpful.
[neutral]	[00:11]	<jrabbit>	then a SQUASHFS error
[negative]	[00:11]	<pale-yafa>	anyway, if any body interested: Samba broke while upgrading
[negative]	[00:11]	<maco>	Dason: oh...wait 2 days
[negative]	[00:11]	<Killeroid>	Dason: too many people upgrading right now, servers hammered
[neutral]	[00:11]	<ubuntuROX>	Dason,, all the servers are bogged down with users
[negative]	[00:12]	<Dason>	Oh that's sensible
[neutral]	[00:12]	<Dason>	No alternate repo's?
[negative]	[00:12]	<RyanPrior>	Dason: Or, download the alternate CD via BitTorrent, burn it and put it in, and upgrade off of there.
[negative]	[00:12]	<gnuskoo1>	do they release server download stats?
[positive]	[00:12]	<maco>	Dason: theyre all pounded too :P
[negative]	[00:12]	<Some_Person>	Why are there no updates available for my hardy-rc?
[neutral]	[00:12]	<Dason>	I have the cd
[positive]	[00:12]	<tanath>	Saladin, a 'nightly' is a cutting edge build, released every day. it's an extension designed to enable extensions for testing on versions of firefox they aren't designed for
[negative]	[00:12]	<oddalot>	hi can someone help me setting up my monitor with xorg.conf i can only get 640x480 and i had it working fine in 7.10
[neutral]	[00:12]	<maco>	Dason: you can upgrade from an alternate cd
[negative]	[00:12]	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo update-grub to fix that.
[positive]	[00:12]	<CyberCod>	can someone tell me the md5sum for Hardy Desktop iso?  just burnt a fresh copy and it is bunk
[neutral]	[00:12]	<maco>	Dason: and there actually is a way to make it search for faster/working repos
[positive]	[00:13]	<tanath>	Dason,  go to System > Admin > Software Sources > Download from other... > Select best server
[negative]	[00:13]	<c0mp13371331337_>	Help!  I started my dist-upgrade from work via SSH and miscalculated how long it would take!  I now have to leave work (and close the SSH connection).  If I send the apt-get process to the background, can I bring it to the foreground in a terminal window at home?
[positive]	[00:13]	<cwillu>	Some_Person, the rc became the r
[negative]	[00:13]	<thebigham>	What program can i use for ubuntu to display cpu temperture?
[negative]	[00:13]	<maco>	Dason: but um...ask someone who uses a GUI how to do it, not me
[negative]	[00:13]	<Dason>	Bittorrent was killer fast. so.. what's the command to use while in the cd?
[neutral]	[00:13]	<pale-yafa>	also: image with transparent backgrounds are having frames, which was not the case with Gutsy
[neutral]	[00:13]	<maco>	Dason: what tanath said
[negative]	[00:13]	<Some_Person>	cwillu: with no changes?
[negative]	[00:13]	<Mike>	Live CD only running at 800x600 on NV5700 card - any ideas...?
[negative]	[00:13]	<marx2k>	So upgrading from ISO can only be done from the alternate install CD?
[negative]	[00:13]	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo update-grub to fix that.
[negative]	[00:13]	<RyanPrior>	Some_Person: the RC and the final release are the same thing, unless the RC has major errors that get fixed.
[neutral]	[00:13]	<jrabbit>	tanath: Buffer I/O error on device sr0

[neutral]	[00:13]	<JPSmon>	this is madeness!!
[negative]	[00:13]	<Flannel>	marx2k: That's correct (or the DVD)), the desktop CD doesn't support upgrades (except for reinstall)
[negative]	[00:13]	<cwillu>	c0mp13371331337_, ideally, having started it in a screen session, you'd be fine

[positive]	[00:14]	<mad_max02>	Where can I find full DVD of hardy for amd64 ???
[negative]	[00:14]	<ubuntuROX>	it changes the label in your boot manager,, they forgot to do that

[negative]	[00:15]	<ubuntuROX>	because you are already on the stable version, they just forgot to update the label where it says development version.

[negative]	[00:17]	<tanath>	Saladin, i had a weird issue like that the first time i tried to use the nightly exension. try restarting it, and make sure you select an extension, then right click and 'make compatible'
[neutral]	[00:17]	<oddalot>	nah
[negative]	[00:17]	<jrabbit>	maco: It causes errors on disk

[positive]	[00:17]	<DooMRunneR>	good night :)
[negative]	[00:17]	<maco>	jrabbit: if it cant verify because of errors, that confirms that its a bad burn
[negative]	[00:17]	<sean_>	Dason: Why? Now you have a reason to go to ubuntu exclusively

[negative]	[00:17]	<Ian1>	would anyone here be willing to help me (noob) fix grub for my new ubuntu install?
[positive]	[00:17]	<mad_max02>	DBautell, yeah. I thought of upgrading my gutsy but I'll go with clean install. I wanna resize / partition to 50gb. I made a mistake and made it 100gb first place :D
[neutral]	[00:17]	<oddalot>	anyone here running a crt?
[negative]	[00:17]	<tanath>	Saladin, um, i thought you were trying to enable FF2 extensions for FF3?
[positive]	[00:18]	<ariqs>	Same here, dason. XP is a good OS despite what all the haters say ;)
[positive]	[00:18]	<cwillu>	cygoku, this is typical stuff (look at any other app that has massive demand on very particular days, (which means I'm not talking about automatically downloaded windows updates, which are throttled precisely to avoid those problems :p))
[negative]	[00:18]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Read the topic. Download the torrent for the Alternate CD.

[neutral]	[00:18]	<linkmaster03>	When will the repos be back up?
[negative]	[00:18]	<nibsa1242b>	Quick question, is there a reason why a network upgrade is preferred to using the alternate disk?
[positive]	[00:18]	<redstelwerk>	thanks Killeroid!
[negative]	[00:18]	<maco>	linkmaster03: when people stop killing them
[negative]	[00:18]	<sean_>	If I had hardy beta, do the regular updates just make it into the final version? or do I have to dist-upgrade?
[positive]	[00:18]	<CyberCod>	OMFG  this is a mad house
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Flannel>	nibsa1242b: It's not really.
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Flare183>	Wheeler: See?
[negative]	[00:18]	<jroes>	I don't think it's that the repos are down moreso than that people are rampaging them
[neutral]	[00:18]	<maco>	sean_: youre done
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Saladin>	No, tanath, I reverted back to FF2
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Flannel>	sean_: yeah, just regular daily updates
[negative]	[00:18]	<Fishscene>	linkmaster03, probably in a day or 2 when things settle down
[neutral]	[00:18]	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Probably in a few days. In the meanwhile, I suggest downloading via BitTorrent. There are thousands of seeds, it's super fast!
[negative]	[00:18]	<ubuntuROX>	cygoku why do you need to download it? if you were running RC and its updated, all you have to do is update your grub.
[neutral]	[00:18]	<cwillu>	nibsa1242b, network will update all the packages you have (aka, won't break things that depend on older versions)
[positive]	[00:19]	<sean_>	maco, Flannel: Thanks. I wished it'd be more exciting but that works. :-)
[neutral]	[00:19]	<x1250>	linkmaster03: just use some mirror repos
[positive]	[00:19]	<Ian1>	Anyone interested in helping me set up grub?
[neutral]	[00:19]	<Dason>	UNIX
[neutral]	[00:19]	<Dason>	sean yea I know. I'll eventually be with UBUNTU fully because Linux is what IT companies want to see expertise in
[negative]	[00:19]	<linkmaster03>	Ryan, i'm just trying to get some synaptic packages =S
[negative]	[00:19]	<DBautell>	mad_max02, you might split that one down the middle, and have two distros installed... Sort of what I'm doing, so I can try different things out
[negative]	[00:19]	<Saladin>	But, now I have done that, because of no extensions working, all of them fail on FF2 now as well. I used apt-get to install 2.
[positive]	[00:19]	<ubuntuROX>	really? linux is hot right now eh?
[negative]	[00:19]	<Dason>	no waii man
[neutral]	[00:19]	<tanath>	Ian1, it should take care of itself..
[negative]	[00:19]	<nibsa1242b>	cwillu: ok, so if I have lots of extra packages installed I should wait until the repos are back up and then upgrade?

[negative]	[00:20]	<ubuntuROX>	it might be worth a try, mine just worked
[negative]	[00:20]	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Technically the servers aren't down right now - it's just that they're serving tens of thousands of requests.
[neutral]	[00:20]	<jrabbit>	Donno its huuuuge dashua`_
[negative]	[00:20]	<jrabbit>	** Dason
[negative]	[00:20]	<linkmaster03>	ok
[positive]	[00:20]	<Saladin>	And I have been using Ubuntu for six months as well
[neutral]	[00:20]	<spork969>	maco, looks to me theyre two programs
[positive]	[00:21]	<Ian1>	gnuskoo1: Well I tried (and failed I suppose) to add an XP line to my list file for grub, and when I tried to boot to it, XP's loader seems to have supplanted grub so now it just goes to that failed boot when i start my computer
[neutral]	[00:21]	<dubby>	hey anyone, I need a very stable java jre and anycase i installed sun-java6 and I need the firefox plugin
[negative]	[00:21]	<tanath>	Saladin, nightly tester tools alters the extensions compatibility. ff2 thinks they don't work anymore. you'll prolly have to reinstall them if you want to go back..
[positive]	[00:21]	<ubuntuROX>	I have been using it for almost a year now
[neutral]	[00:21]	<maco>	spork969: its called Nvu Kompozer
[neutral]	[00:21]	<sp219-away>	Does anyone know why clipboard charing from windows to ubuntu does not work properly?
[positive]	[00:21]	<Fishscene>	The servers are undergoing the equivelant of DDoS attack- except it's ALL legitimate traffic. :)
[neutral]	[00:21]	<tanath>	Saladin, you shouldn't lose settings though\
[neutral]	[00:21]	<Flannel>	MachinTrucChose: install the nautilus-gksu package

[neutral]	[00:21]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, weird. WFM
[negative]	[00:21]	<Ian1>	i know how to reinstall grub in the terminal, but i'm not sure how to tell which drive to install it to
[positive]	[00:21]	<MachinTrucChose>	thanks flan
[negative]	[00:21]	<ubuntuROX>	ahh,, see theres your problem
[negative]	[00:21]	<eduardo>	Question: How do i upgrade ubuntu from the terminal?
[negative]	[00:21]	<cwillu>	sp219-away, please give it more than 30 seconds between repeats
[negative]	[00:21]	<Saladin>	Although... It only took me three days to know I wasn't going back to Windows
[positive]	[00:21]	<maco>	spork969: kompozer is the latest release of nvu
[neutral]	[00:21]	<Dason>	apt-get upgrade (sud)
[negative]	[00:21]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, you tried letting it go for a few mins?
[neutral]	[00:21]	<Dason>	sudo apt-get upgrade
[negative]	[00:21]	<ubuntuROX>	at least I bet its your problem,, uninstall that nightly tools extention
[negative]	[00:21]	<RyanPrior>	Eduardo, I don't suggest doing it today.
[negative]	[00:21]	<ubutom>	"Hi guys, I have a problem with my xserver, or with the ""unbreakable"" xserver, I think, can someone help me?"
[negative]	[00:22]	<Saladin>	tanath, however... Nightly isn't showing up on the extensions list.
[neutral]	[00:22]	<RyanPrior>	eduardo: The servers are totally swamped.
[neutral]	[00:22]	<spork969>	maco, gotcha
[negative]	[00:22]	<eduardo>	RyanPrior: why is that?
[neutral]	[00:22]	<maco>	!ask | ubutom
[positive]	[00:22]	<ubotu>	ubutom: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[negative]	[00:22]	<cygoku>	I thought the repos would be mirrored or something.
[neutral]	[00:22]	<eduardo>	RyanPrior: ohhh
[negative]	[00:22]	<ubuntuROX>	go to FF3 it should be there
[neutral]	[00:22]	<maco>	eduardo: /me points at calendar
[negative]	[00:22]	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: it just worked... doesn't seem to be a good server though... yeah earlier I let it go for about 10min the window just went blank
[negative]	[00:22]	<tanath>	Saladin, huh... well i've never downgraded like that, so...
[neutral]	[00:22]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: The repos are mirrored, all over the world. They are all swamped.
[neutral]	[00:22]	<ubuntuROX>	then un-install it
[positive]	[00:22]	<SeaPhor>	Has anyone discovered if RTL8185 wlan chipset works in 8.04? please?
[neutral]	[00:22]	<cygoku>	wow
[positive]	[00:22]	<Dason>	System > Admin > Softy Sources choose best
[negative]	[00:22]	<ibleed>	i only have swap / and /home partitions.  what other possible partitions might i want and what might their sizes be ?
[positive]	[00:22]	<maco>	cygoku: they are. there are hundreds of mirrors.  theyre pretty much all swamped.
[negative]	[00:22]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, hrm, i guess they're getting hammered worse than i thought
[neutral]	[00:22]	<Flannel>	eduardo: @HLINK has instructions
[negative]	[00:22]	<alienbrain>	I just tried Hardy Heron Installation LiveCD feature, my network is not working. I don't see my module. Should I hope for better after installation or this aspect won't change?
[negative]	[00:22]	<cygoku>	That's crazy you know.
[neutral]	[00:23]	<maco>	alienbrain: wired or wireless?
[neutral]	[00:23]	<ere4si>	ibleed: a partition for / is handy
[neutral]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	maco, wireless
[neutral]	[00:23]	<sean_>	"I had compiz working fine in beta, but now I upgraded and whenever I go to ""normal"" or ""extra"" I lose all window decorations. Any ideas?"
[neutral]	[00:23]	<maco>	alienbrain: do you have any wired connection available?
[positive]	[00:23]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Millions of Ubuntu users try to upgrade all at once; thus, we have craziness aplenty. :-)
[neutral]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	maco, ipw3945 module
[negative]	[00:23]	<Ertyle>	alienbrain: if it doesn't work on the live CD, then it doesn't work in the installation. out of the box, that is - it's entirely possible that you *can* get it to work!
[negative]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	maco, yep sure
[negative]	[00:23]	<ibleed>	ere4si, yes i have swap, /, and /home.  i'm wondering what others are useful
[neutral]	[00:23]	<x1250>	alienbrain: it will probably won't work
[neutral]	[00:23]	<cygoku>	""" millions "" ????"
[neutral]	[00:23]	<cwillu>	alienbrain, what chipset?
[neutral]	[00:23]	<Dason>	Now to get copywritten DVD's to work right.....
[negative]	[00:23]	<ubutom>	Well, maco, everytime I start up ubuntu now it doesnt work, the xserver simply doesnt come up. i tried dpgk-reconfigure, I erased and replaced the xorg.conf, but no joy...
[positive]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	Ertyle, I see, it was working on Gutsy though, out of the box
[positive]	[00:23]	<maco>	alienbrain: oh you have a 3945? the module is now called iwl3945. it works great for me
[positive]	[00:23]	<MachinTrucChose>	first thing to do in every ubuntu install: disable the *!!@#$ motherboard beep
[negative]	[00:23]	<ere4si>	ibleed: that is all really - unless it is a server
[negative]	[00:23]	<nibsa1242b>	ibleed: /var ~4GB (or less) good for log files... you don't want to have some faulty device fill up your log files and make your system unbootable... and /boot ~500MB (should hopefully be enough)
[negative]	[00:23]	<x1250>	alienbrain: but that doesn't mean you can't make it work...
[neutral]	[00:23]	<sandfisch>	is it possible to update the beta to full?
[neutral]	[00:24]	<alienbrain>	cwillu, Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG
[negative]	[00:24]	<tanath>	sean_, try running 'compiz --replace' from a terminal, and see the output
[positive]	[00:24]	<Flannel>	sandfisch: yes, just regular daily updates
[negative]	[00:24]	<Dason>	Machin! Tell me now! I hate it!
[negative]	[00:24]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Yup, supposedly Ubuntu has about 10 million users, so if more than 10% try to upgrade, that's millions.
[neutral]	[00:24]	<Ertyle>	alienbrain: then file a bug
[positive]	[00:24]	<sean_>	sandfisch: Just do regular updates and you're all set!
[positive]	[00:24]	<Baughn>	MachinTrucChose: I've found that an axe does that very well
[negative]	[00:24]	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: I think I'll just wait a few days to upgrade... no rush
[neutral]	[00:24]	<MachinTrucChose>	dason: @HLINK
[negative]	[00:24]	<the_darkside_986>	Everything operation in hardy is laggy and slow, and the CPU fan keeps spinning. What do I type to fix this?
[neutral]	[00:24]	<tanath>	sean_, er, make that 'compiz --replace &'
[negative]	[00:24]	<ibleed>	nibsa1242b, what about /opt ?  is that useful ?
[negative]	[00:24]	<Mimi>	alienbrain:  you have a problem w/ 3945? It's been fixed...
[neutral]	[00:24]	<Ertyle>	sandfisch: just let it run its normal updates, and you'll have final
[positive]	[00:24]	<cygoku>	Well I am impressed.
[negative]	[00:24]	<gaucho>	My audio isn't working.. It was perfectly working about 5 minutes ago on gutsy. I have an Asus p5b motherboard. What can I do?
[negative]	[00:24]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, thought you said it just worked?
[positive]	[00:24]	<alienbrain>	x1250, I understand, but I'm trying to assess how much time I need to spend after upgrading :)
[negative]	[00:24]	<maco>	RyanPrior: you only hit multiple millions when 20% try to upgrade
[negative]	[00:24]	<ubutom>	atm i can only access the root repair console
[neutral]	[00:24]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, meh
[neutral]	[00:25]	<x1250>	alienbrain: did it work on gutsy?
[negative]	[00:25]	<phiqtion>	how can i install XMMS in HARDY? thx
[positive]	[00:25]	<cwillu>	maco, as if 50% of the installed base isn't trying to upgrade though :p
[neutral]	[00:25]	<RyanPrior>	maco: I call 1.1 more than one million, thus millions. One and one tenth millions.
[neutral]	[00:25]	<maco>	crimsun: ping
[negative]	[00:25]	<ubutom>	every attempt to start gdm fails, failsafe graphics seems to be broken
[negative]	[00:25]	<maco>	cwillu: yeah...
[negative]	[00:25]	<sean_>	tanath: I think I need to re-enable nvidia drivers, does that make sense?
[negative]	[00:25]	<alienbrain>	Mimi, in Gutsy, I would see that ipw3945 module is automatically loaded. Now in Hardy, I don't see it. Even when I try to modprobe. It's not there
[negative]	[00:25]	<nibsa1242b>	ibleed: I don't know, never needed an /opt before but I'm just running it on a few computers for personal use
[neutral]	[00:25]	<cygoku>	Danson ??
[neutral]	[00:25]	<DBautell>	even ,75 is a multiple
[negative]	[00:25]	<ubutom>	so, what should I do? Does someone have an idea?
[neutral]	[00:25]	<maco>	alienbrain: its not called that
[neutral]	[00:25]	<tanath>	sean_, ah. in that case displayconfig-gtk may help
[negative]	[00:25]	<yeknom_traf>	which version of ubuntu would i want to install on an iMac with duocore processor?
[neutral]	[00:25]	<maco>	alienbrain: its called iwl3945
[negative]	[00:25]	<cygoku>	I mean Dason ??
[positive]	[00:25]	<maco>	alienbrain: theres a new driver
[negative]	[00:25]	<alienbrain>	maco, aha, let me check please
[negative]	[00:25]	<Baughn>	sean_: You need to reinstall the nvidia drivers every time you upgrade your kernel. Which a distribution upgrade does. Granted, it might be automatic normally, but apparently not now..
[negative]	[00:25]	<Joelito>	Hi, I can't use livCD of ubuntu 8.04
[neutral]	[00:25]	<phiqtion>	how can i enable UNIVERSE and MULTIVERSE in HARDY?
[neutral]	[00:25]	<nibsa1242b>	alienbrain: check restricted drivers manager to see if you have to enable it in there
[neutral]	[00:25]	<Saladin>	Now, when I click on the launcher for FF3, it is FF2 that pops up. I am totally confused.
[neutral]	[00:26]	<Joelito>	and the md5sum is correct
[positive]	[00:26]	<x1250>	alienbrain: you can always uninstall kernel metapackages (linux-image, linux-image-generic, linux-headers-generic, etc) and use them in hardy
[negative]	[00:26]	<Mimi>	alienbrain:  (sorry if you've already said that, but I just joined the channel) .. and this is the realease, not the release candidate or beta? I have the same card as yours, and I installed hardy from livecd.. wireless worked there, and after install it worked too :/ sorry not sure how to help, thought it was fixed for all of us
[neutral]	[00:26]	<tanath>	phiqtion, System > Admin > Software Sources
[positive]	[00:26]	<sean_>	Baughn: Jest because it's newly released?
[neutral]	[00:26]	<fdsjkalf>	is archive.ubuntu.com down?
[positive]	[00:26]	<RyanPrior>	"yeknom_traf: Ubuntu 8.04 ""Hardy Heron"" is the hot item now. It's available via BitTorrent, but today is release day so non-BitTorrent servers are very slow and swamped."
[negative]	[00:26]	<maco>	Joelito: do a cd check and be more specific, please
[negative]	[00:26]	<Jorophose>	Hi, important advisor, I'm an idiot who tries too hard. If I upgrade from 6.06 to 8.04: How long will it take me to do that (do I have to download a full 700MB?), is there any chance of it bjorking my system? and can I do it at any time or only today before there's newer nightly builds?
[negative]	[00:26]	<jjt001>	where is cgi-bin located in ubuntu?
[positive]	[00:26]	<Mimi>	﻿/me asks :  is it possible to increase the DPI on gnome? ... I have 1200x800 but it seems like a simple window takes most of the screen :P
[neutral]	[00:26]	<alienbrain>	maco, I can see the driver is there
[neutral]	[00:26]	<Mike_T>	nv
[negative]	[00:26]	<maco>	fdsjkalf: its a release day. how could it possibly stay up?
[neutral]	[00:26]	<x1250>	alienbrain: I meant: uninstall kernel metapackages, and upgrade to hardy. Then, as metapackages are not installed, then your kernel version will be preserved.
[positive]	[00:27]	<nibsa1242b>	sean_: Baughn I think sometimes the necessary drivers take a few days after the dist upgrade to become available for the kernel version
[negative]	[00:27]	<Baughn>	sean_: I don't actually know if it normally does, but if it does, then the reason it doesn't /now/ would be because it's a separate upgrade system that doesn't know about that detail
[positive]	[00:27]	<alienbrain>	Mimi, sure, that gives me higher hopes! :)
[negative]	[00:27]	<phiqtion>	tanath: they are selected already but i can't find XMMS in the sources?
[negative]	[00:27]	<sean_>	tanath, oh, nevermind. I forgot that was on my laptop! It uses intel drivers which is correct. Do I need to install xgl?
[neutral]	[00:27]	<jjt001>	maco: is cgi-bin located in var/www?
[negative]	[00:27]	<ubutom>	xserver dead, failsafe doesnt work, dpkg-reconfigure no joy, erasing xor.conf and replacing with old version no joy, any ideas?
[neutral]	[00:27]	<cwillu>	Mimi, prefrerences | appearance| fonts
[positive]	[00:27]	<RyanPrior>	Mimi: System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution
[negative]	[00:27]	<nous>	how do I start the graphic card config wizard ?
[negative]	[00:27]	<Baughn>	nibsa1242b: That's why there's a compile-from-source option
[negative]	[00:27]	<maco>	jjt001: *shrug* i never figured out how to make apache go on my laptop
[positive]	[00:27]	<nibsa1242b>	Baughn: mmm fun
[positive]	[00:27]	<Joelito>	maco: Hi, When I put the CD in the cd-rom, the cd-rom stops reading during the ubuntu banner with progressbar, but only the cd-rom light keeps on.
[neutral]	[00:27]	<fdsjkalf>	maco, you assume i know its release day. anywho, cool. new releases are great
[positive]	[00:27]	<alienbrain>	x1250, I see, but I can only install from the CD at the moment, not very good bandwidth :)
[negative]	[00:27]	<Baughn>	"nibsa1242b: ""Trivial"", you mean. Normally it takes no effort at all."
[neutral]	[00:27]	<sandfisch>	is it possible to update the beta to full?
[negative]	[00:27]	<maco>	Joelito: does it get to the menu part?
[negative]	[00:27]	<tanath>	phiqtion, odd. they're in mine. you might try xmms2 though.
[positive]	[00:27]	<alienbrain>	So guys, thank you a lot. I will give it a chance! :)
[positive]	[00:27]	<cwillu>	alienbrain, then wait for a day or two :p
[positive]	[00:27]	<sean_>	sandfisch: Just do regular updates and you're all set!
[negative]	[00:28]	<jjt001>	maco: i'm trying to install dansguardian, and i need the cgi-bin directory?
[negative]	[00:28]	<tanath>	sean_, no, shouldn't need xgl. i don't anyway
[neutral]	[00:28]	<Joelito>	maco: yes
[positive]	[00:28]	<RyanPrior>	sandfisch: It is certainly possible. Regular updates will do the trick 100%.
[neutral]	[00:28]	<Joelito>	maco: I choose language and keyboard language
[positive]	[00:28]	<alienbrain>	cwillu, nah, I will just go ahead now, can't wait :D
[positive]	[00:28]	<nibsa1242b>	sandfisch: in the past the beta/ RCs updated automatically with the regular updates
[negative]	[00:28]	<maco>	fdsjkalf: see the topic? and the front page of ubuntu.com (if it's up?)? and the announcement on the forum? and the mailing lists? and every ubuntu blog on the planet?
[negative]	[00:28]	<Dason>	joelito i had that same problem
[neutral]	[00:28]	<tanath>	nous, 'gksu displayconfig-gtk'
[neutral]	[00:28]	<bingofuel>	can anyone can help me installing ubuntu with a sata disc_
[negative]	[00:28]	<x1250>	alienbrain: I think you can upgrade using just the cd... do you have gutsy installed?
[negative]	[00:28]	<Dason>	burn another disk at a slower speed
[positive]	[00:28]	<sandfisch>	thanks all
[negative]	[00:28]	<alienbrain>	x1250, yep
[negative]	[00:28]	<Joelito>	Dason: How do you fixed it?
[negative]	[00:28]	<Mimi>	"cwillu:  Oh, I missed the ""Details"" button, thanks! ... Mmm.. it shows me changes on demand... yay!"
[negative]	[00:28]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: what is your problem?
[neutral]	[00:28]	<phiqtion>	tanath: servers are being hammered right?
[negative]	[00:28]	<alienbrain>	maco, any idea how can I precisely tell what the problem is coming from?
[negative]	[00:28]	<maco>	jjt001: oh.  i dont know.  itd involve apache webserver...id say ask the ubuntu christian edition people. they install it by default
[negative]	[00:28]	<sean_>	tanath: I have a thinkpad T61 with integrated graphics. the i810 driver wasn't any better

[neutral]	[00:29]	<metanil>	hello
[neutral]	[00:29]	<maco>	Joelito: do a cd test
[positive]	[00:29]	<cwillu>	x1250, alienbrain, you can update from cd, but any packages that are missing won't be updated, and may break in spectacular explosions with shock wave effect
[neutral]	[00:29]	<Starnestommy>	IntangibleLiquid: possibly
[neutral]	[00:29]	<Ertyle>	IntangibleLiquid: yes
[positive]	[00:29]	<fdsjkalf>	maco, whether or not your assumption seems reasonable, it wasnt accurate

[negative]	[00:32]	<anonusr>	if I update to 8.04 using the alternate cd, and my system can't access the servers because they are overloaded, does that mean that all my packages that were in universe or multiverse will stop working until the server becomes available again?

[neutral]	[00:32]	<maco>	anonusr: ones that dont need to update will be fine...others will probably still work and lack new features
[negative]	[00:32]	<sean_>	Ubuntu should work on automatic update file sharing or something. Like automatic torrents or something

[positive]	[00:33]	<cwillu>	sean_, apt-torrent is in the universe, I think they're working on integrating it
[neutral]	[00:33]	<tanath>	sean_, security is an issue though

[neutral]	[00:33]	<simonft2>	??
[negative]	[00:33]	<goat|work>	hmm,  I wonder why the hardy update manager will not check the CD before requesting files from the repos... I have the CD option set in the software sources, and inserted...  anyone know if this is a known issue?

[neutral]	[00:33]	<simonft2>	lol
[negative]	[00:33]	<Baughn>	tanath: Why? They're hashed, and presumably the actual torrents would be stored centrally
[positive]	[00:33]	<simonft2>	3 different answers
[neutral]	[00:33]	<maco>	goat|work: disable the internet repos
[negative]	[00:33]	<simonft2>	im tring to make a program come up on start up
[negative]	[00:33]	<cwillu>	tanath, security, not so much, more that bit-torrent doesn't have a good way to update parts of torrents
[neutral]	[00:33]	<goat|work>	maco, in gutsy's software sources?
[positive]	[00:33]	<Roxer>	i have to say i freaking love Ubuntu, im totaly new to ubuntu. Tho i have used gentoo for 8 years
[negative]	[00:33]	<sean_>	True on all accounts. It'd be a great feature if they figured out how to do it securely.

[negative]	[00:41]	<burner>	OzFalcon: i assume it depends on the fedora partition type
[negative]	[00:41]	<x1250>	doesn't work for you Dason?
[positive]	[00:41]	<jPratt>	lol Well you knoe most things that are made are for Windows and well i like my Photoshop :P
[negative]	[00:41]	<Datalanche>	"Hi. I just tried to do a fresh install of Hardy on my computer. I have two drives and two optical drives on my motherboards IDE controller, and three more hard drives on my Silicon Image-based PCI-IDE card. It is detecting the Sil-card's drive first(hda, hdb, and hdc). After the install, all I get is a screen full of ""﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ..."" What can I do to fix this?"
[positive]	[00:41]	<Dason>	Crystal xp
[positive]	[00:41]	<bingofuel>	je i was playing like a grub wizard but my magic is bad :p,
[negative]	[00:41]	<bingofuel>	tell me your idea...if doesn-t work no problem
[neutral]	[00:41]	<OzFalcon>	burner, ext3
[negative]	[00:41]	<Dason>	killled my dlls and I lost mah windows Cd
[negative]	[00:41]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: yep, looking to see what else i can turn up
[positive]	[00:41]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: cool thanks
[positive]	[00:42]	<altj>	damn, I've been seeding kubuntu images all day and just started seeding ubuntu images.  There's a bit of a difference in demand :-)
[neutral]	[00:42]	<OzFalcon>	Can hardy resize ext3 partitions?
[negative]	[00:42]	<maco>	Datalanche: did the install complete?
[negative]	[00:42]	<Dason>	SOOOOO... I can't install anything without opening in WINE and moving to Windows
[neutral]	[00:42]	<Fishscene>	lol altj
[positive]	[00:42]	<Datalanche>	maco: Yes, finished fine and I clicked restart.
[neutral]	[00:42]	<jPratt>	Course we all know regular Ubuntu=Pwnage given by the Linux Gods
[negative]	[00:42]	<ng0n>	o.. i got your notes here.. .sorry.
[negative]	[00:42]	<sven_oostenbrink>	What exactly is the difference between 64 bits ubuntu and 32 (ignoring the obvious)? is 64 bits faster? could it cause problems with compatibility? will all (32 bits) programs work without problem on 64 bits?
[negative]	[00:42]	<sean_>	"tanath: I have integrated intel graphics and compiz isn't working. I'm using the ""intel"" driver. Any ideas?"
[neutral]	[00:42]	<Datalanche>	maco: In Gutsy, my onboard IDE drives were hda and hdb. Now they are all sdX
[positive]	[00:42]	<dmg46664>	I have downloaded the hardy CD for safe keeping in case of new installations, but I want to merge the packages on it with our local apt-cache, so local machines can all upgrade without all downloading 9 hours worth of packages each. Where can I find docs on how to do that?
[positive]	[00:42]	<FrankH>	hi. what is the new package name for vim-full?
[positive]	[00:42]	<ryanpg>	yay! Hardy Heron! Boo! my canon camera still doesn't automount - anyone have tips on getting this feature back? It was in the early betas...
[neutral]	[00:43]	<derspankster>	installed Hardy Server on a box I put together and I am totally lost
[positive]	[00:43]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: you on gutsy or hardy?
[neutral]	[00:43]	<Datalanche>	whereas before just the ones on the sil card were sdX
[neutral]	[00:43]	<maco>	Datalanche: thats normal.thats a libata change
[neutral]	[00:43]	<Dason>	(shell32 was moved with some UI in Windows modifications)
[negative]	[00:43]	<erat123>	ubuntu 8.04 comes w/ a browser in beta?!!?  what's the deal???
[neutral]	[00:43]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: gutsy
[neutral]	[00:43]	<tanath>	sean_, did you use displayconfig-gtk to try different drivers?
[negative]	[00:43]	<maco>	Datalanche: are any of the drives reporting themselves wrong to the bios?
[neutral]	[00:43]	<Jack_Sparrow>	!aptoncd > dmg46664
[positive]	[00:43]	<biabia>	maco yay ! the notes are there. thanks
[neutral]	[00:43]	<maco>	Datalanche: i know there are issues with sata drives that tell the bios to pretende they're IDE
[negative]	[00:43]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: I tink I might have something for you to help... hold on a min
[negative]	[00:43]	<x1250>	erat123: firefox3 should be there
[positive]	[00:43]	<sean_>	tanath, unfortunately. :-\ I also checked my graphics card and it says intel should be the one
[negative]	[00:43]	<Mike_T>	HowTO : Get better than 800x600 in vn 5700 using live cd - no xorg options on boot?
[positive]	[00:43]	<tanath>	sean_, test different drivers and after each working one, run 'glxinfo | grep -i direct' to see if direct rendering is enabled
[negative]	[00:43]	<Datalanche>	maco: Nope, I watched them all pop up, they seem to be going in just fine. Oh, and also, they are IDE drives, not SATA
[negative]	[00:43]	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b ok
[negative]	[00:43]	<Jack_Sparrow>	maco, I am running on sata pretending to be ide here
[negative]	[00:44]	<tanath>	sean_, i dunno. might try google & ubuntu forums
[negative]	[00:44]	<zado>	firefox 3 beta 5 is good enough for release
[positive]	[00:44]	<ng0n>	is the new Ver out.  I got Gusty
[neutral]	[00:44]	<jPratt>	Yes it is
[neutral]	[00:44]	<maco>	Datalanche: theyre *all* IDE? all more than 5?
[neutral]	[00:44]	<Dason>	Mike T restricted drivers in System > admin
[negative]	[00:44]	<sean_>	tanath: is there any way to add displayconfig-gtk to my main menu? It used to be in admin
[negative]	[00:44]	<erat123>	x﻿1250: god i hope i didnt get the wrong version...
[negative]	[00:44]	<eternalis1>	maco i got some error
[negative]	[00:44]	<fdsjkalf>	is it true that ff3 uses an ugly bold font for the URL
[negative]	[00:44]	<ng0n>	hmmm. ok.
[negative]	[00:44]	<Datalanche>	maco: Yes, I have five IDE hard drives.
[negative]	[00:44]	<eternalis1>	maco: it says i have to check my internet connection, but im connected so wtf?
[negative]	[00:44]	<tom_>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.
[neutral]	[00:44]	<jPratt>	ng0n yes hardy is out
[negative]	[00:44]	<Dason>	wow, there's the background update!
[negative]	[00:44]	<fdsjkalf>	thats reason enough to not use it
[neutral]	[00:44]	<rich_freecomm>	Greetings Scunizi
[neutral]	[00:44]	<erat123>	so, does firefox beta come w/ hardy or the finished release?
[negative]	[00:44]	<maco>	Jack_Sparrow: the problem is when you have lots of IDE and it gets confusing when the OS sees lots of IDE due to that bios setting
[neutral]	[00:44]	<tanath>	sean_, menu editor?
[positive]	[00:44]	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink: I highly recommend 32 bit. Not everything works out of the box with 64 bit that does with 32 bit. And there should be 5% or less performance difference between the two unless you are running a machine with >4GB of RAM.
[neutral]	[00:44]	<ng0n>	Hardy.  I like the sound of that.
[negative]	[00:44]	<maco>	Datalanche: you cant do that
[negative]	[00:44]	<Jack_Sparrow>	eternalis1, Please do not use that shorthand..
[neutral]	[00:44]	<noodles12>	firefox beta 5
[neutral]	[00:44]	<Dason>	erat, the finish for F3 isn't out yet
[negative]	[00:45]	<eternalis1>	Jack_Sparrow: do you have a solution, or are you going to sass me?
[negative]	[00:45]	<maco>	Datalanche: i dont know how else to explain it but...5 IDEs just cant go
[positive]	[00:45]	<sean_>	tanath: nevermind. I'm blind. :)
[neutral]	[00:45]	<tanath>	XD
[positive]	[00:45]	<maco>	Datalanche: its a bug
[negative]	[00:45]	<Datalanche>	maco: Uh, yeah I can. I have two connect on the motherboard's IDE controller, and three on a PCI expansion card.
[negative]	[00:45]	<OzFalcon>	erat123, Beta5, But you can download prev stable release if you want.
[negative]	[00:45]	<Datalanche>	oh, really
[negative]	[00:45]	<ng0n>	flash, sass and white trash : welcome to #ubuntu !
[negative]	[00:45]	<x1250>	ff3 is ok, but it doesn't use pulseaudio. That feature was pushed to ibex, instead.
[neutral]	[00:45]	<DEstlund>	anybody seen persistent CRC errors on hardy install from cd?
[neutral]	[00:45]	<goat|work>	Jack_Sparrow: was banned?
[negative]	[00:45]	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b you-re saying that i have to install the 32 bits version_
[negative]	[00:45]	<erat123>	that's too bad.    when i go to ubuntuguides.org, my X session logs off under firefox beta5....   i might have to downgrade firefox
[negative]	[00:45]	<maco>	Datalanche: on ubuntu, 5 IDEs just cant go
[positive]	[00:45]	<Mike_T>	Dason: None listed...:-(
[negative]	[00:45]	<goat|work>	sorry, nvm
[neutral]	[00:45]	<Datalanche>	maco: It was working just fine in Gutsy
[positive]	[00:45]	<erat123>	i sent in a bug report, but didnt hear back
[negative]	[00:45]	<Dason>	hmm...
[negative]	[00:45]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: check and see if there's an update available for libgtk2; a couple of people reported that as fixing the problem for them
[negative]	[00:46]	<joh6nn>	does anyone know how to make screen behave more like xterm, with regards to termcap/terminfo stuff?  when i use vim inside of screen, i occasionally get some weird behaviour
[negative]	[00:46]	<IntangibleLiquid>	fdsik -l /dev/sda says cannott open /dev/sda: what should I do?
[neutral]	[00:46]	<maco>	Datalanche: regression....its a known bug on hardy though
[neutral]	[00:46]	<tanath>	talntidwrk, found it: netselect-apt
[negative]	[00:46]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: that was for someone else... there is nothing wrong with 64 bit version, however, most people I know and myself prefer the 32 bit version for ease of use
[negative]	[00:46]	<Dason>	intang - Are you using Sudo?
[neutral]	[00:46]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: libgtk2 is the name on repos?
[negative]	[00:46]	<OzFalcon>	Too much noise....
[neutral]	[00:46]	<ng0n>	64 bit.  drivers ?
[negative]	[00:46]	<Datalanche>	I don't understand.
[negative]	[00:46]	<Datalanche>	it was never a problem before
[neutral]	[00:46]	<jvai_>	no straight upgrade from dapper to hardy in 09'?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: anyhow... @HLINK should help you boot
[neutral]	[00:47]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: not sure, the posts don't say for sure
[positive]	[00:47]	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: you should be able to go from Dapper to Hardy
[negative]	[00:47]	<Dason>	IntangibleLiquid are you using sudo fdisk ?
[negative]	[00:47]	<ng0n>	i'm too nube to 64
[neutral]	[00:47]	<capo>	so the repo's are all still down?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<tanath>	gah, aptitude wants to autoremove all my xmm2 plugins. why?!
[neutral]	[00:47]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: thanks i found it, installing now
[positive]	[00:47]	<IntangibleLiquid>	﻿Dason: no, but thanks, it shows the partitions
[neutral]	[00:47]	<jvai_>	"aaw ""CLAPPIN""...  ty IndyGunFreak"
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Jorophose>	IndyGunFreak: Would you just follow the same procedure then? (update-manager -d)
[negative]	[00:47]	<phiqtion>	XMMS2 has no GUI? is there a starter guide for HARDY?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Gman99999>	has the downloading of the upgrade stopped for anyone else?  is the server possibly down?
[positive]	[00:48]	<tanath>	phiqtion, audacious is very similar to xmms
[negative]	[00:48]	<capo>	yeah i think the repo's are down
[negative]	[00:48]	<DBautell>	the only thing I remember having to fiddle with was getting the 32 bit firefox
[neutral]	[00:48]	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: Jorophose i never done it, but i'm almost 100% certain, you can go from 1 LTS version, to another LTS version, w/o loading up the versions in between
[neutral]	[00:48]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: you'll need to download the CDROM or USB version
[negative]	[00:48]	<capo>	i can't download any packages
[negative]	[00:48]	<Gman99999>	ah wait here we go
[neutral]	[00:48]	<x1250>	Gman99999: just pick a mirror
[neutral]	[00:48]	<joh6nn>	Gman99999: the repos are choked
[negative]	[00:48]	<IntangibleLiquid>	﻿Dason: the sad thing is, Partition Editor says my current harddisk space is unallocated
[negative]	[00:48]	<DBautell>	for flash, etc
[negative]	[00:48]	<blbrown>	im back, I got the 8.04 iso CD download, but I dont see any cdromupgrade.  is there somewhere I should look for that
[positive]	[00:48]	<tanath>	capo, there's plenty of mirrors
[negative]	[00:48]	<ng0n>	my Vista found out i was doing Ubuntu and I swear, it has straighted up a little.  is that possible ?
[positive]	[00:48]	<Dason>	Gman999999                          System - Admin Softy Sources - Alternative sources - scan for best
[neutral]	[00:48]	<maco>	Datalanche: and in hardy it is a problem.  things changed and it got broken.  thats all there is to it
[neutral]	[00:48]	<jvai_>	IndyGunFreak,  it should hold reason from one LTS to another.. right?
[positive]	[00:48]	<rich_freecomm>	mine is still puttin away.....of course it says I have about 48 days left
[negative]	[00:49]	<dmg46664>	Jack Sparrow: Thanx for the link to aptoncd... however I think what I was looking for was apt-cache-import
[neutral]	[00:49]	<maco>	Datalanche: hopefully itll be fixed by 8.04.1 in june, but maybe it wont
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Jorophose>	IndyGunFreak: What are the odds of it going bang in my face?
[negative]	[00:49]	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: one would think.. google it though, i'm almost 100% SURE OF IT.
[neutral]	[00:49]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: they are the latest versions
[neutral]	[00:49]	<jvai_>	'k
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Dason>	IntangibleLiquid I suggest using an external disk drive editor then
[negative]	[00:49]	<joh6nn>	ng0n: yeah, but if that's what it takes to make Vista behave, is it worth keeping around?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<sven_oostenbrink>	nibsa1242b> 64bits is slower?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: ; (
[negative]	[00:49]	<IndyGunFreak>	Jorophose: don't really know, never done it.... try googling it... i install every 6mo
[positive]	[00:49]	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink:  DBautell: yes, Firefox and extensions and Wine are the two main things that I find are easier to use in 32bit... one can always run the 32bit version on a 64 bit system but it takes time
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Dason>	Such as GParted
[negative]	[00:49]	<tanath>	Jorophose, follow the guide in the topic and  you should be good
[negative]	[00:50]	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink: I think 64bit is marginally faster... but it depends
[negative]	[00:50]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: did this used to work and suddenly broke, or did it never work?
[positive]	[00:50]	<thedonvaughn>	ng0n: yah it's a feature.  If you install a linux kernel greater than 2.6.24, vista knows and it tweaks it's parameters (tm)]
[negative]	[00:50]	<hansin>	ng0n: Yeah, I head there is a bit of code in Vista that detects if you are dool-booting Linux, and if so it runs better.  I guess MS must have figured if your dual boot Linux, that Vista better shape up in case you might make the full switch.
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Datalanche>	hmmmm
[neutral]	[00:50]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: it worked yesterday
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Mike_T>	hansin: lol
[negative]	[00:50]	<pifedo>	Hi! My sound isn't working.. I have an Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02), but alsa can't find any sound card. What can I do?
[positive]	[00:50]	<Jack_Sparrow>	dmg46664, several options available
[negative]	[00:50]	<Datalanche>	Well then, I dunno what to do if I can't use Hardy on my computer.
[neutral]	[00:50]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: so what'd you do to break it between now and then? : )
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Light|DC>	t/hop
[neutral]	[00:50]	<ng0n>	hansin: I knew it !@!
[negative]	[00:51]	<Gman99999>	is wine even a viable method for installing popular windows aps I sure hear alot of people preaching how much better linux is than windows but Ive had so much trouble with simple hardware drivers that pissed me off alot, what makes linux so good?
[neutral]	[00:51]	<jwwadk>	hello all. this may sound like a noobish problem: my screen brightness options have disappeared
[negative]	[00:51]	<unop>	joh6nn, you might need 'altscreen on'
[negative]	[00:51]	<blbrown>	sh: Can't open /media/cdrom0/cdromupgrade ... wtf
[positive]	[00:51]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: nothing xD
[neutral]	[00:51]	<tanath>	pifedo, hardy uses pulseaudio now...
[neutral]	[00:51]	<eternal_p>	Gman99999: go to www.winehq.com and look for the app in question
[neutral]	[00:51]	<Dason>	Gman, to be king, yes
[negative]	[00:51]	<pifedo>	tanath: So, What can I do? My sound isn't working any way...
[neutral]	[00:51]	<hansin>	ng0n:
[negative]	[00:51]	<joh6nn>	unop: just throw 'altscreen on' in my .screenrc ?

[neutral]	[00:51]	<Myke516>	Hey everyone
[neutral]	[00:51]	<tanath>	hansin, o.O have a source for that?
[neutral]	[00:51]	<Dason>	How can we help
[neutral]	[00:51]	<Datalanche>	Too late
[negative]	[00:51]	<Datalanche>	I just wiped it
[neutral]	[00:52]	<Gman99999>	are there lots of bugs still in hardy heron?
[negative]	[00:52]	<jPratt>	whats LTS stand for
[neutral]	[00:52]	<Datalanche>	heh
[negative]	[00:52]	<thedonvaughn>	Gman99999: it's not made for easy plug-n-play.. even tho ubuntu tries that.  Sometimes you gotta manually install or setup a driver if that company who makes that piece of hardware doesn't give a linux driver for free and or hardware calls to developers to include in kernel.
[negative]	[00:52]	<DBautell>	nibsa1242b, sven_oostenbrink, I seem to remember the BOINC people saying the speed difference is negligible, and even sometimes negative. Never occured to me that that might be part of my wine diffculties
[negative]	[00:52]	<SeaPhor>	Gman99999, you can send me a tell and if i know i'll discuss it with you
[negative]	[00:52]	<Dason>	Long Term Service
[positive]	[00:52]	<fdsjkalf>	im going to try hardy today, i may even continue to use it
[negative]	[00:52]	<unop>	joh6nn, aye, yes .. but i'm just stabbing in the dark - what exactly is vim doing in screen?
[positive]	[00:52]	<FrankH>	﻿what is the new package name for vim-full?
[negative]	[00:52]	<hansin>	ng0n: I was just kidding with you.  I highly suspect it is not related, at least not intentionally so.  But that would be funny.
[negative]	[00:52]	<pifedo>	Gman99999: Oh yes! A LOT OF!
[negative]	[00:52]	<tanath>	pifedo, you could make sure you have all the pulseaudio stuff you need, and remove the alsa & other stuff
[neutral]	[00:52]	<jwwadk>	does anyone know how to manually change screen-brightness?
[negative]	[00:52]	<phiqtion>	does anyone know how to run XMMS2 on hardy?

[negative]	[00:52]	<hansin>	tanath: Yeah, isdualbootlinux?.dll.
[negative]	[00:52]	<nibsa1242b>	Gman99999: I only use WINE to visit sites in IE that refuse to work with firefox, opera, or Konq. And that doesn't always work so well so I revert to kqemu.

[negative]	[00:54]	<Datalanche>	maco: I still think this is a grub and/or devmapping issue. I had this problem once before in Edgy or whenever they changed up the ATA a while back, and fixed it by installing Ubuntu on a drive on the PCI controller and it worked flawlessly. I guess I'll just have to scramble my drives and do it that way again... annoying as it is. >_>

[positive]	[00:59]	<Deiz>	So, as with every time I install Ubuntu, windows maximize to both my monitors instead of one. Is there a workaround? I recall with 7.04 I got lucky after a reboot and it started working properly.
[negative]	[00:59]	<tanath>	e2, 'gksu displayconfig-gtk' to make sure you have the right driver installed
[positive]	[00:59]	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: the new one; hardy

[neutral]	[01:00]	<tanath>	bradlis7, it is...
[negative]	[01:00]	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: I can't help you there... haven't been able to upgrade. I'm waiting for the repos to be less swamped.
[positive]	[01:00]	<unop>	bradlis7, it can be, but xorg can work without one
[positive]	[01:00]	<e2>	It's an old 128 Mb NVidia card.  Worked just fine with compiz on 7.10.
[positive]	[01:00]	<Jack_Sparrow>	bradlis7, xorg is entirely different with this release
[negative]	[01:00]	<Ertyle>	anathematic: though to be honest, i think you'd be better off waiting until the mirrors actually start working again and there is some documentation
[negative]	[01:00]	<doug2266778822>	 why do the animations not work in compiz?
[neutral]	[01:00]	<jjt001>	Dason: you just need to look harder

[negative]	[01:00]	<anathematic>	Ertyle: yeah i think i might wait anyway ty
[negative]	[01:00]	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: but the solution should be the same, right?
[neutral]	[01:00]	<bradlis7>	is there another file?
[negative]	[01:01]	<unop>	bradlis7, you could create one i guess
[negative]	[01:01]	<x1250>	bradlis7: it is, but its minimal because xorg tries to autodetect things. You can edit it by hand, its your choice
[neutral]	[01:01]	<ng0n>	5200 ?
[negative]	[01:01]	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: can I pm you, please?
[neutral]	[01:01]	<jjt001>	Dason: there are open source alternatives to almost everything

[neutral]	[01:02]	<bradlis7>	i have a flat screen... i finally got the nv driver to work, and the resolution works right when logged in, but the GDM resolution is too big, and displaymanager-gtk has never used the resolution that it says it uses
[positive]	[01:02]	<sean_>	tanath: it passes the direct rendering test though
[neutral]	[01:02]	<Jack_Sparrow>	SeaPhor, np use that
[negative]	[01:02]	<jwwadk>	what's the max resolution on your monitor?

[neutral]	[01:20]	<theunixgeek>	raiderxx: @HLINK
[positive]	[01:20]	<raiderxx>	thanks
[neutral]	[01:20]	<bazhang>	mattycoze: live or alternate
[positive]	[01:20]	<cabrioleur>	linkmaster03, @HLINK - most recent one
[positive]	[01:20]	<Liquidy>	raiderxx: if you upgraded all of your applications on your previous distro you wouldn't have to see any diference :)
[negative]	[01:20]	<towlieban>	matty you mean upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 ?
[negative]	[01:20]	<sammy>	hmm. I should come back a few weeks after upgrade day.
[positive]	[01:20]	<linkmaster03>	cabrioleur thank you very much
[neutral]	[01:20]	<JPSmon>	mattycoze: not with THAT CD, you have to download the alternate install CD
[neutral]	[01:20]	<raiderxx>	liquidy: I upgrade regularly

[neutral]	[01:21]	<theunixgeek>	raiderxx: @HLINK
[neutral]	[01:21]	<mattycoze>	ahh dang
[negative]	[01:21]	<unop>	mattycoze, i'm not sure, with previous releases only the alternate CD could do upgrades that way
[neutral]	[01:21]	<bazhang>	mattycoze: need the alternate then
[neutral]	[01:21]	<navetz_>	my apt-get just broke on me
[negative]	[01:21]	<cappicard>	hm.. anyone not able to connect to us.archive.ubuntu.com when running apt-get?

[neutral]	[01:21]	<sammy>	cappicard: it's swamped.
[neutral]	[01:21]	<theunixgeek>	ryoohki: this one
[negative]	[01:21]	<Liquidy>	if you keep it up to date, and with everything been opensource, what did you expect of hardy?
[negative]	[01:21]	<Liquidy>	it's nothing new
[negative]	[01:21]	<cappicard>	yeah i can see that
[positive]	[01:21]	<clay>	yeah, apt-get is having a hard today :)
[positive]	[01:21]	<ryoohki>	theunixgeek: thanks!
[negative]	[01:21]	<fluidd>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.
[neutral]	[01:21]	<sammy>	cappicard: consider picking a closer mirror
[neutral]	[01:21]	<theunixgeek>	ryoohki: (read the topic)
[negative]	[01:21]	<unop>	mattycoze, but rathe that download the iso .. you might as well upgrade directly - see !upgrade if you are interested
[negative]	[01:21]	<DrX>	I want to partition a 465G RAID 5 array to hold mission-critical data for optimal flexibility so it can hold Linux & Windows (NTFS) partitions that can be easily resized and grown onto additional drives -- what do you all suggest?
[negative]	[01:22]	<_ZeuZ_>	Guys, is there any package in Ubuntu Server for Per-Host-In-The-Network bandwidth allowance control? Without having to use TCNG directly nor recurring to htb-gen nor htb.init ? I don-t want to use CBQ either...
[negative]	[01:22]	<Ertyle>	ryoohki: this is it, but #ubuntu-release-party if it's not a support question
[neutral]	[01:22]	<theunixgeek>	cappicard: torrent (see titlte)
[neutral]	[01:22]	<theunixgeek>	*topic
[neutral]	[01:22]	<navetz_>	is there a way to fix apt-get?
[neutral]	[01:22]	<sammy>	or the torrent. right.
[negative]	[01:22]	<jwwadk>	is anyone else having problems with brightness settings using hardy?
[negative]	[01:22]	<dabbill>	no matter what i do i cant get my nvidia driver to take for my 8800GT, tried useing envyng, installing straight from nvidia website. Every time i reboot the computer it goes back in to low graphics mode. Also when i try to run nvidia-settings it says i am not useing the nvidia driver.
[neutral]	[01:22]	<oddalot>	anyone know how to get emerald themes in 8.04?
[neutral]	[01:22]	<_ZeuZ_>	"dabill: get rid of the ""bulletproof config"""
[positive]	[01:22]	<mattycoze>	yeh unop too late :P i downloaded the iso last night without thining too much
[neutral]	[01:22]	<gluer>	can i do a hardy upgrade from the full iso?
[neutral]	[01:22]	<_ZeuZ_>	dabill: manually edit the xorg.conf
[neutral]	[01:22]	<_ZeuZ_>	it's not hard
[positive]	[01:23]	<unop>	mattycoze, shoulda come in here first :)
[negative]	[01:23]	<_ZeuZ_>	you'll only have to remove a couple of lines
[negative]	[01:23]	<cappicard>	ah, that got released?
[neutral]	[01:23]	<dabbill>	_ZeuZ_, tried many of times
[negative]	[01:23]	<oddalot>	dabill...i had problems, i had to open the display thingy...it's not in the system menu anymore
[negative]	[01:23]	<cappicard>	i'm still on gutsy. didn't know there was a new release. lol
[neutral]	[01:23]	<mattycoze>	unop yeah i was, there was already talk about the servers being blitzed
[negative]	[01:23]	<raving>	Does anybody know of a torrent for 8.04?
[positive]	[01:23]	<_ZeuZ_>	dabbill, seems like not correctly xD
[neutral]	[01:23]	<Ertyle>	raving: type /topic
[negative]	[01:23]	<Zasch>	Hello. I'm trying to upgrade to the new release of ubuntu, but whenever I try it Update Manager just freezes up

[positive]	[01:24]	<dabbill>	_ZeuZ_, i had it working perfict in 7.10, but cant get it to work in 8.04
[neutral]	[01:24]	<oddalot>	anyone here got emerald working?
[positive]	[01:24]	<unop>	mattycoze, ohh, ahh well - not to worry, you can redistribute the ISO to friends and family :)
[negative]	[01:24]	<sammy>	Zasch: it's probably having a hard time talking to the servers, mine did that too. try running aptitude and picking a closer mirror to download from.
[negative]	[01:24]	<cabrioleur>	fsufitch, have you tried the integrated gnome menu?
[neutral]	[01:24]	<_ZeuZ_>	dabbill, I'm on Hardy
[negative]	[01:24]	<mohbana>	can i install from a ntfs partion, i don't have a dvd handy
[negative]	[01:24]	<JPSmon>	cappicard:  stick with the old for a while till we get these bugs worked out
[neutral]	[01:24]	<mohbana>	without using wubi
[negative]	[01:24]	<sammy>	Zasch: I mean synaptic, not aptitude.
[positive]	[01:24]	<seamus7>	Zasch today is the first day of the release ... the servers always get slammed on day's like today ... just be patient
[positive]	[01:24]	<_ZeuZ_>	PM me so I can show you
[negative]	[01:24]	<Ertyle>	mohbana: i don't think so
[neutral]	[01:24]	<dabbill>	_ZeuZ_, what do you have the driver set as? nvidia or nv ?
[neutral]	[01:24]	<_ZeuZ_>	and help you
[negative]	[01:24]	<cappicard>	ok, i agree on that.
[neutral]	[01:24]	<_ZeuZ_>	nvidia
[negative]	[01:24]	<bradlis7>	hm, nvidia still not showing up in restricted drivers
[neutral]	[01:24]	<fsufitch>	cabrioleur: yes, i can get it workngi under gnome, but i prefer using my kde. is there a way to access the gnome menu in kde?
[neutral]	[01:24]	<bazhang>	mohbana: from within windows? try unetbootin or wubi then
[positive]	[01:24]	<altj>	does Hardy have mysql 5.1?

[positive]	[01:25]	<_ZeuZ_>	dabbill, remember to identify first
[neutral]	[01:25]	<towlieban>	altj no you have to install it seperately
[neutral]	[01:25]	<KalEl>	hi.. can't join to #ubuntu+1
[neutral]	[01:25]	<_ZeuZ_>	SeaPhor, IRC dos not have that capability

[positive]	[01:25]	<Ertyle>	altj: i see only 5.0
[neutral]	[01:25]	<_ZeuZ_>	KalEl, ??
[neutral]	[01:25]	<theunixgeek>	KalEl: that's because hardy's been released

[negative]	[01:25]	<ryoohki>	hmm. i seem to be missing nfs-common
[negative]	[01:25]	<dny>	My update manager isn't showing any new updates, is it because the servers are busy or something else? :x

[negative]	[01:26]	<Shpook>	Hello everyone, I have a laptop and I want to use the vga output to my tv, but I'm getting no video out of it. Is there a way to enable video output?
[neutral]	[01:26]	<KalEl>	oh great!

[neutral]	[01:26]	<nickrober>	anyone else having scratchy sound problems?

[positive]	[01:26]	<_ZeuZ_>	create a channel is not the same xD
[neutral]	[01:26]	<_ZeuZ_>	though Here I go
[positive]	[01:26]	<bd__>	yea my update manager keeps crashing when I try to upgrade
[negative]	[01:26]	<boolka>	how do i turn on svideo output on my laptop? ( the function key + f4  dont work - did in windows) ?
[positive]	[01:26]	<Ertyle>	KalEl: try #ubuntu-release-party perhaps :)
[neutral]	[01:26]	<Daisuke_Ido>	Shpook, you'll probably have to use a fn key combo
[negative]	[01:26]	<bmk789>	anyone else seeing high CPU usage with FF3 beta 5?
[negative]	[01:26]	<dny>	well i knew they were busy, but i didn't know if that'd be the reason.  mine doesn't crash like everyone elses seems to do, it just doesn't show any new updates. :/
[negative]	[01:26]	<simonft2>	bmk789: nope
[neutral]	[01:26]	<bazhang>	bmk789: what extensions yo have loaded
[neutral]	[01:26]	<goat|work>	anyone know why  the hardy update manager will not check the CD before requesting files from the repos... I have the CD option set in the software sources, and inserted, and I've unchecked the internet sources in the gutsy software sources
[positive]	[01:26]	<cabrioleur>	fsufitch, also, here @HLINK is an interesting article how to modify xorg.conf (based on integrated intel card)
[neutral]	[01:26]	<simonft2>	bmk789: much less than ever
[neutral]	[01:26]	<sammy>	Zasch: synaptic package manager should be easy to find, look with the other administration tools. you're going to open the 'repositories' item in the menus, and there should be a drop-down list to select your mirror. you can then select 'other' and click the button to find your closest mirror.
[negative]	[01:27]	<Shpook>	Daisuke_Ido: Sorry, I meant to mention that I tried that and it didn't work.
[positive]	[01:27]	<KalEl>	Ertyle :)
[negative]	[01:27]	<fsufitch>	cabrioleur: thx! i'll try
[negative]	[01:27]	<jwwadk>	does anyone know how to control screen brightness without using the power manager?
[negative]	[01:27]	<Pc_Madness>	are the repositories overloaded atm? :\
[negative]	[01:27]	<bmk789>	bazhang: good question, ill try to disable a few and see what it does
[neutral]	[01:27]	<linkmaster03>	What is the GTK library package name?
[negative]	[01:27]	<JPSmon>	goat|work: is it the alternat install CD?
[neutral]	[01:27]	<scizzo->	Pc_Madness: yes
[neutral]	[01:27]	<goat|work>	JPSmon: no desktop
[negative]	[01:27]	<Pc_Madness>	bah :(

[neutral]	[01:27]	<nickrober>	anyone else having scratchy sound problems?
[negative]	[01:27]	<scizzo->	Pc_Madness: hard to say since they are hammered with traffic really
[negative]	[01:27]	<goat|work>	Pc_Madness: eta is now,  its just super slow
[neutral]	[01:27]	<Starnestommy>	linkmaster03: libgtk2.0-0
[negative]	[01:28]	<Shpook>	Was it nvidia-settings or something that used to allow dual monitors?
[neutral]	[01:28]	<seamus7>	jwwadk I am able to adjust screen brightness by doing FN + arrowup/arrowdown
[positive]	[01:28]	<linkmaster03>	thanks Starnestommy
[negative]	[01:28]	<goat|work>	JPSmon: why wouldn't the desktop work over the alt install cd?
[neutral]	[01:28]	<goat|work>	as a software source
[negative]	[01:28]	<Shpook>	seamus7: I'm basically trying to do the same thing as you, except with a cga output instead of s-video.
[negative]	[01:28]	<smallfoot->	which i should install gnash, swfdef or adobe?
[positive]	[01:28]	<Pc_Madness>	did Ubuntu mobile get released last night as well?
[neutral]	[01:29]	<MP2E>	Hello all
[neutral]	[01:29]	<cabrioleur>	Shpook, yes, nvidia-settings can modify xorg.conf to let you use multiple screens.
[negative]	[01:29]	<bazhang>	goat|work: just not made to do that
[negative]	[01:29]	<JPSmon>	goat|work: hrm I dunno.

[negative]	[01:29]	<_ZeuZ_>	Guys, is there any package in Ubuntu Server for Per-Host-In-The-Network bandwidth allowance control? Without having to use TCNG directly nor recurring to htb-gen nor htb.init ? I don-t want to use CBQ either...
[positive]	[01:29]	<Shpook>	cabrioleur: Thank you, hopefully it will allow me to enable the vga output on my laptop.
[neutral]	[01:29]	<jwwadk>	seamus7: thanks, but the hotkeys are different on my laptop. i was thinking more of a software-based solution
[negative]	[01:29]	<Pc_Madness>	bugger :(
[neutral]	[01:29]	<bazhang>	corden: need to install
[negative]	[01:29]	<bmk789>	bazhang: I disabled a bunch that didnt work anyway and now it seems to be behaving correctly, thanks
[neutral]	[01:29]	<jcwilliams>	Anyone up for helping a newbie with an Install problem?
[positive]	[01:29]	<goat|work>	bazhang: so the alt install would be identified?  damn, had i known :-)
[negative]	[01:29]	<raiderxx>	I read online about a family tree making program. Does that come preinstalled, or do I have to download it, and if so, what is it called?
[neutral]	[01:30]	<jvai_>	i'm ghost everyone.. peac
[negative]	[01:30]	<corden>	bazhang, so i need inet connection so that i can download the gui?
[negative]	[01:30]	<MentalNotes>	Does anybody know what's happened to the Gobuntu Hardy release? The latest build on cdimage.ubuntu.com was a daily from 4 days ago
[positive]	[01:30]	<MP2E>	Well I'm having problems installing Ubuntu 7.10 on an SiS 630/730 Integrated system along with an AMD Athlon 32-bit processor
[negative]	[01:30]	<linkmaster03>	jcwilliams: it might help if you tell us what your problem is. don't ask to ask a question
[neutral]	[01:30]	<KalEl>	archive.ubuntu.com clogged
[negative]	[01:30]	<bazhang>	goat|work: many new packages are just not on the livecd; if you have hardy already you dont need either cd
[positive]	[01:30]	<Shpook>	Wow, servers must be slammed with the release. I'm only getting 15kbps when I usually get 400-500+
[positive]	[01:30]	<dny>	does virtualbox need a lot of power to run?
[negative]	[01:30]	<MP2E>	Ubuntu's installer crashes on BusyBox

[negative]	[01:31]	<bmk789>	i hope people are using the torrents instead of downloading images via http/ftp *cough cough*
[neutral]	[01:31]	<bazhang>	MP2E: check the md5sum for that disk
[negative]	[01:31]	<corden>	oic, i thinking if the gui it on the cd, just need to be install. bazhang
[neutral]	[01:31]	<raiderxx>	Anyone know?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<MP2E>	Did
[positive]	[01:31]	<Zicks>	osmosis emerald under hardy heron doesnt work --- but fix is emerald --replace
[positive]	[01:31]	<jcwilliams>	I am trying to install Ubuntu 7.10 on an XPS 420.  I think my video card is the problem.  I am running an Nvidia Geforce 8800GT
[negative]	[01:31]	<Zasch>	instead of trying to upgrade through update manager, would it be faster to just download the CD?
[positive]	[01:31]	<cycom>	bmk789: I think it's more the dist-upgrade folks
[neutral]	[01:31]	<MP2E>	bazhang: I have previously installed Ubuntu from that same disk
[negative]	[01:31]	<Paulius>	How can I enable SSH on Hardy?
[negative]	[01:31]	<JPSmon>	bmk789: I would help with that if my internet wasn't screwed up
[positive]	[01:31]	<MP2E>	But on a different system
[neutral]	[01:31]	<cycom>	Paulius: sudo apt-get install ssh
[neutral]	[01:31]	<ANTDx1>	Paulius, install the openssh package
[negative]	[01:31]	<MP2E>	could a scratch possibley have messed it up?
[positive]	[01:31]	<cycom>	Paulius: it does the rest ;)
[negative]	[01:31]	<MP2E>	But Disk Check doesn't work either
[positive]	[01:31]	<bmk789>	cycom: ya but arent the images hosted on the same server?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<x1250>	Paulius: openssh-server or -client
[neutral]	[01:31]	<DrX>	if your hardware RAID controller lets you dynamically grow volume groups, do you still need to you LVM to grow partitions?
[positive]	[01:31]	<Paulius>	"cycom, ANTDx1: It says ""package obsolete"" on both."
[neutral]	[01:32]	<bazhang>	Zasch: likely both are slow at this point--torrents would be fastest
[negative]	[01:32]	<ANTDx1>	hmm
[negative]	[01:32]	<sammy>	oh, look at that, I wonder whats in /boot/grub/default? nope. thats not it.

[negative]	[01:32]	<goat|work>	raiderxx: if you don't know the program name, its hard to identify if its on the OS, but i haven't heard of any
[negative]	[01:32]	<bmk789>	cycom: or at least using the same bandwidth
[negative]	[01:32]	<ANTDx1>	try openssh-server, like someone else said

[negative]	[01:32]	<cycom>	bmk789: presumably, but I don't think most people are going and downloading an ISO right now

[negative]	[01:32]	<sammy>	would anyone happen to know where debconf is getting the UUID for my root partition to put into my grub configuration? I've moved it and it thinks it's in the same place and I have no idea where it's set

[neutral]	[01:43]	<pure`eigenVector>	is there a howto gusty->hardy upgrade guide when using the torrent download?
[neutral]	[01:43]	<DBautell>	rhanthony, ubuntu discourages logging in as root, and does not let you pick the password unless you sudo su and change it

[positive]	[01:43]	<rhanthony>	sweet cheesus... thank you!

[negative]	[01:44]	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 what kind of computer?
[positive]	[01:44]	<Starnestommy>	rhanthony: it makes it much harder for crackers to gain control and sudo logs things, unlike root logins
[neutral]	[01:45]	<KyleK>	moveax: click customize maybe?

[neutral]	[01:52]	<seamus7>	the_darkside_986 I don't think tracker affects boot time ... you can even set it to delay initiation by however long you wish from within its preferences ... my experience is that the compisite window manager takes some time to completely initiate after log on

[positive]	[01:54]	<mojo>	greets!  i just did a fresh install of 8.04RC the other day and can't find a good howto on dual monitors for hardy.  all the ones i find are very old.  the screen res tool is not detecting the 2nd monitor, using fglrx with compiz; 2nd monitor is working as a sort of clone but not at same res so it scrolls the viewport.  Help/ideas?

[negative]	[01:56]	<sammy>	smick: thank you, nvidia and ati, for thinking that a closed source world is the best answer to innovation and progress. easily half of the questions I see for linux are 'my video is f'd up!' just 'cause there's so much pressure for one to be better than the other.
[positive]	[01:56]	<lirit>	bazhang: the live cd. it asked me to install from the CD the very first time I inserted it. But after that, it only shows me the contents.

[neutral]	[02:14]	<c0mp13371331337_>	k[5\5]-  You'll need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list and change every instance of 'gutsy' to 'hardy'.
[negative]	[02:14]	<MachinTrucChose>	anyone else have this problem? My wifi works, but after I reboot, it doesn't work. I'm thinking it's gotta be a permissions thing, I had the same problem in 7.10. I'm sure the fine people at Canonical didn't ship it with a Network-Manager that doesn't work with wifi cards, so can anyone recommend a fix (other than installing 3rd party apps like Wicd)

[negative]	[02:29]	<CaptainMorgan>	just attempted to start the install... it hangs after making a selection from the install menu right after startup.... is this a hardware issue? supposedly Hardy heron has already run smooth on other's systems identical to mine... maybe the CD is bad? no matter which option is chosen from the menu it's as if the CD drive stops working(which I know works fine otherwise) and then nothing happens and also I can't make another sele

[negative]	[02:33]	<cal_>	where is the 64bit torrent
[negative]	[02:33]	<samalex>	iznuics: try downloading via bittorrent and see if it goes quicker.. justa suggestion.  I started http download and after 20 minutes and it saying 2 hours left I kicked off a bittorrent download -- 30 minutes later I was instaling.

[negative]	[02:34]	<Pelo>	JoshBP, the alternate cd or the dvd , just pop it in and you will be asked if you want to upgrade,  when asked if you want to check for pacakges online say no
[negative]	[02:34]	<solace>	How do I go about  doing that?
[positive]	[02:34]	<Odd-rationale>	Arnos: cool. that is the way I do it.

[negative]	[02:35]	<telexicon>	Gman99999, i dont think that was ever enabled by default in any version

[negative]	[02:35]	<Gman99999>	the hard drive spin down one that was all over the news
[neutral]	[02:35]	<CaptainMorgan>	can anyone assist? I'm sure my question has been long overlooked simply due to the number of visitors talking......
[neutral]	[02:35]	<]grimm[>	Is there a way to assign mount points to drives (outside of using fstab)?  I was able to set it under properties in Gutsy, but that seems to have changed with the latest version of Gnome and policykit.

[neutral]	[02:35]	<bazhang>	CaptainMorgan: repeat your question
[negative]	[02:35]	<Pelo>	kenan, either you have the desktop effects or metacity compositing enabled,  start by checking hte desktip effect,  in the apperance menu ,  it that's not it ask me and I will tell you how to turn off metacity compositing
[neutral]	[02:36]	<rich_freecomm_>	  /nick no no really, I'm the same person on both areas
[negative]	[02:36]	<deadend>	Skuller: The desktop cds have always seemed to be a bit buggy on the install bit. They are handy for showing off ubuntu but at this time not much more then that. Download the alternate install iso, check the md5, burn it then do a disk check, that should solve your problem
[neutral]	[02:36]	<goat|work>	funny ubotu
[negative]	[02:36]	<CaptainMorgan>	just attempted to start the install... it hangs after making a selection from the install menu right after startup.... is this a hardware issue? supposedly Hardy heron has already run smooth on other's systems identical to mine... maybe the CD is bad? no matter which option is chosen from the menu it's as if the CD drive stops working(which I know works fine otherwise) and then nothing happens and also I can't make another sele
[negative]	[02:36]	<Exodus>	dabbill: depending on what the Xorg log says about why nvidia isn't loading and it's falling back on vesa, I got no idea =b

[negative]	[02:36]	<Pelo>	evilbug,  no , you boot your installed ubuntu and pop the cd/dvd in

[negative]	[02:37]	<iznuics>	sammy: ah that was for desktop.. I was looking for server.
[negative]	[02:37]	<bazhang>	CaptainMorgan: check md5sum on iso; reburn at really low speed; do checkdisk at startup, if all that fails then either get a new iso, reburn again or try the alternate cd

[negative]	[02:44]	<marko-_->	Millertime_018, because hardy just came out
[negative]	[02:44]	<Roscar>	pelo: I was looking at the release notes. They give you a list of know problems and issues for upgrading but not a list of changes.

[neutral]	[02:44]	<marko-_->	and people are upgrading there system
[neutral]	[02:44]	<marko-_->	all over the world
[negative]	[02:44]	<sammy>	Roscar: because a lot of your packages are out of date, and newer, tested, 'stable' versions are available that people have released. as long as you're already getting security updates, that's the only reason. it's been either 6 months or a year, so there's probably a good number of fixes and feature updates, probably hundreds? thousands?
[positive]	[02:44]	<bazhang>	Millertime_018: today is release day
[negative]	[02:44]	<bbyever>	i opened the update-manager and checked for updated and there were none, so i proceeded to upgrade to hardy, and while the upgrade was starting, update-manager said there were 710 updates available. Then a window came up and asked me if i wanted a partial upgrade.. should i do that, or the upgrade to hardy?
[neutral]	[02:44]	<marko-_->	you must understand this..

[positive]	[03:08]	<c0mp13371331337_>	navreet-  Bittorrent would probably be the fastest at this point, as the Ubuntu servers/mirrors are all bogged down at the moment.  Which may be why it doesn't prompt you to upgrade right away.  They may give a few days for all the manual-upgraders to get it out of their system before rolling out the option to upgrade to the general public.
[negative]	[03:08]	<Pelo>	harsha, it's used after ,  make it about 2xram  max 2 gig
[neutral]	[03:08]	<Stroganoff>	Skuller, press ctrl+alt+f4

[negative]	[03:10]	<harsha>	Pelo: I have 1 GB of ram that means I have to allote 2 GB for swap drive, am I correct?
[neutral]	[03:10]	<woddf2>	Hello
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, you can open/close your cd/dvd ddrive from the bios ? that' sa new one to me
[positive]	[03:10]	<woddf2>	Update Manager keeps hanging!
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Stroganoff>	p0w3r0n3: sudo apt-get install unzip
[positive]	[03:10]	<lopin>	Actually, manually selecting a mirror close to home is working nicely...
[neutral]	[03:10]	<Pelo>	harsha, yes
[negative]	[03:10]	<Ubuntong>	erat123: I'm no expert but make sure PHP is installed correctly. maybe install myphpadmin so you can make sure it's working.  A kind of shortcut is to install egroupware since it's requirements are PHP, Apache2, Mysql. So you will get everything installed correctly.
[negative]	[03:10]	<TheDukeNY>	How do I had my internal hard drive to my desktop?
[neutral]	[03:10]	<lopin>	Go to software sources, and select a mirror that's closer to you
[neutral]	[03:10]	<TheDukeNY>	*add
[neutral]	[03:10]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, as the computer is going through BIOS, I can hit the open/close button and it will open or close the drive.
[negative]	[03:10]	<juano__>	Skuller: hmm ok, was thinking maybe you forgot to check if it was x64 architecture, cause in that case you need to download the x64 cd
[neutral]	[03:10]	<rich_freecomm>	ahhh
[positive]	[03:10]	<Pelo>	woddf2, it's release day the servers are under heavy loads,  get the torrent for the alternate install cd and upgrade from that
[positive]	[03:10]	<harsha>	Pelo: Thanks for the help.
[positive]	[03:11]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, the drive also worked perfectly 15 mins ago in Feisty.
[neutral]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stronganoff, its already installed?
[negative]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stronganoff, any other ideas?
[negative]	[03:11]	<Skuller>	By the way the problem I mentioned arises when trying to boot off the live version of the OS
[negative]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stroganoff, any other ideas?
[negative]	[03:11]	<lopin>	Pelo:  I couldn't get that to work, but switching to a local server helped TREMENDOUSLY!
[neutral]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stroganoff, already installed
[neutral]	[03:11]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, I don't have an answer for you , report the bug to launcpad
[negative]	[03:11]	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: i'll give that a try and see where it goes.  i went to their site, and it looks cool.  i've just never heard of it.  sorry i cant really help you with your problem though.
[negative]	[03:11]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, Okay.
[neutral]	[03:11]	<Shadow_X>	Pelo, can you perform a standard upgrade from the alternate cd?
[neutral]	[03:11]	<lopin>	Shadow_X
[neutral]	[03:11]	<HardyOne>	Shadow_X: yes
[negative]	[03:11]	<DBautell>	Shadow_X, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[negative]	[03:11]	<KyleK>	hey can I upgrade from feisty to hardy?
[negative]	[03:12]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 you should do   tail -f /var/log/syslog , try inserting a disk, and including the output in your report
[negative]	[03:12]	<shane2peru>	anyone know anything about a DVD iso for ubuntu (of course the 8.04 edition)
[negative]	[03:12]	<favoritefood0>	Oh, pelo, get this, Sysinfo detects the drive just fine.
[positive]	[03:12]	<juano__>	Odd-rationale: i'm off to try 8.04 now :P:)
[negative]	[03:12]	<Pelo>	Shadow_X, yes,  alt cd or dvd, but not from the live cd
[positive]	[03:12]	<Ubuntong>	erat123: Thanks and good luck with wordpress.
[neutral]	[03:12]	<MachinTrucChose_>	MachinTrucChose_,
[positive]	[03:12]	<lopin>	Pelo Chaning to a local server helped...
[negative]	[03:12]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, I get the issue I just donT' have a fix for you
[negative]	[03:12]	<MachinTrucChose_>	sorry, just testing
[negative]	[03:12]	<professor_>	KyleK, and then what
[positive]	[03:12]	<Shadow_X>	yea i know not from livecd, but its been forever since i used the alt. thanks :)
[positive]	[03:12]	<myf>	hi, how many people has been able to upgrade to hardy here?
[negative]	[03:12]	<shane2peru>	in particular, where to get the DVD iso?
[negative]	[03:12]	<lopin>	I can't use the alt cd to upgrade...
[negative]	[03:12]	<blankhead>	does anyone know how to get into text only mode in hardy heron?
[neutral]	[03:12]	<lopin>	It locks...
[positive]	[03:12]	<Pelo>	lopin, helped with what ?
[negative]	[03:12]	<HardyOne>	MachinTrucChose_: this text should be red
[neutral]	[03:12]	<DBautell>	!torrents
[neutral]	[03:12]	<ubotu>	Hardy can be torrented from @HLINK or @HLINK depending on your architecture. Torrents for other Ubuntu flavours can be found at: @HLINK (CD) or @HLINK (DVD).
[positive]	[03:12]	<Odd-rationale>	juano__: go for it. I'm seeding all the alternative cd's :)
[neutral]	[03:12]	<thiebaude>	i upgraded 3 days ago
[negative]	[03:12]	<favoritefood0>	nickrud, what exactly do you mean? I insert a disk and the drive does nothing. I have to open the drive manually, close it manually.
[positive]	[03:13]	<juano__>	Odd-rationale: good job :)
[neutral]	[03:13]	<KyleK>	professor_: after you select a difffernt mirror? close it
[positive]	[03:13]	<MachinTrucChose_>	hardyone: thank you
[neutral]	[03:13]	<unop>	blankhead, ctrl+alt+f1 ?
[neutral]	[03:13]	<aubrac>	KyleK: @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:13]	<lopin>	I finally could download updates by going from us.ubuntu.com to a local server, hosted at WVU
[neutral]	[03:13]	<HardyOne>	juano__: I am also seeding all the iso's
[negative]	[03:13]	<moon2js>	"Trying to upgrade from Gutsy to Hardy, but update-manager hangs (Beryl-greys out) on ""Preparing to upgrade"" and doesn't do anything. Are the repos overloaded or do I have a problem?"
[negative]	[03:13]	<cirkit>	"If you're on 8.04 RC1, will ""update manager"" be good enough for the upgrade?"
[neutral]	[03:13]	<KyleK>	it'll apt-get update automatiicaly
[negative]	[03:13]	<Stroganoff>	p0w3r0n3 maybe the EXE isnt ZIP compressed. try xarchiver
[negative]	[03:13]	<MachinTrucChose_>	X-chat is the nicest client so far...LostIRC has no features, neither does Xchat-Gnome. Konversation's pretty cool too, but I guess everyone was right to recommend X-chat.
[positive]	[03:13]	<shane2peru>	Thanks DBautell
[positive]	[03:13]	<sammy>	lopin: I've been trying to tell people once I changed my mirror everything went quickly, but I guess there is something to wanting more iso discs out there :)
[negative]	[03:13]	<professor_>	KyleK, no where do I find the mirror
[negative]	[03:13]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 ooohh, sounds hardware. The disk tray action should have nothing to do with the os
[positive]	[03:13]	<lopin>	Sammy ^.^
[neutral]	[03:13]	<myf>	moon2js: same here
[negative]	[03:13]	<bod_>	moon2js, the repo's are being raped
[neutral]	[03:13]	<nosa-J>	hurray for heron!
[neutral]	[03:13]	<shane2peru>	or, thanks ubotu lol
[neutral]	[03:14]	<juano__>	HardyOne: Odd-rationale keep it up, cyou in a while
[negative]	[03:14]	<favoritefood0>	nickrud, the thing is is that it worked in feisty a few minutes ago, works in BIOS, it's even detected.
[neutral]	[03:14]	<DBautell>	shane2peru, I try
[neutral]	[03:14]	<jumpkick>	need apt-bittorrent
[positive]	[03:14]	<moon2js>	so once the repos are recover, it will work?
[neutral]	[03:14]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: irssi
[negative]	[03:14]	<Tailsfan>	What does this mean for when a get a error with this: SET_MODULE_OWNER
[neutral]	[03:14]	<Odd-rationale>	I have two computer seeding
[neutral]	[03:14]	<favoritefood0>	I can go into my feisty live CD, and I'll come talk on IRC lol
[positive]	[03:14]	<MachinTrucChose_>	sammy: thanks, not a fan of console clients :P
[neutral]	[03:14]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 do you dual boot? Will it boot the hardy cd?
[positive]	[03:14]	<KyleK>	professor_: download from: its a dropdown, click around in there :)
[negative]	[03:14]	<Millertime_018>	how can i get vmware-server to show up in the add/remove applications box?
[neutral]	[03:14]	<Pelo>	okaratas, I'm out again,  later folks
[negative]	[03:14]	<Shadow_X>	another question. do distro upgrades fail often? (I upgraded an old ubuntu server to 7.10, and it failed to reboot properly. i was a n00b then so reinstalled lol)
[neutral]	[03:14]	<thiebaude>	cya
[neutral]	[03:14]	<HardyOne>	late Pelo
[negative]	[03:14]	<jPratt>	Wow the servers have calmed down thank god
[negative]	[03:14]	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; I just upgraded from feisty.
[negative]	[03:14]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: then try pidgin/gajim/kopete/etc with an irc plugin or a jabber server with an irc gateway.
[negative]	[03:15]	<Millertime_018>	how can i get vmware-server to show up in the add/remove box?
[negative]	[03:15]	<shane2peru>	DBautell, hmm, seems as that there is a traffic jam at that site.
[negative]	[03:15]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 I know, but we're talking about current troubleshooting info
[negative]	[03:15]	<taxman>	yago: after you got that message, you were able to shutdown normally with no errors? And now what exactly happens? What do you mean by can't do anything?
[neutral]	[03:15]	<moon2js>	Can I do a dist-upgrade but have it access the repos from a CD?
[positive]	[03:15]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: pidgin and gajim actually both do really well with irc transports on jabber servers. so does psi
[negative]	[03:15]	<ffm_>	Millertime_018, Just remove it via synaptic.
[neutral]	[03:15]	<ffm_>	Millertime_018, Sys>Admin>Synaptic.
[neutral]	[03:15]	<KyleK>	damn
[positive]	[03:15]	<damo22>	sudo: timestamp too far in the future: Apr 25 13:04:51 2008
[negative]	[03:15]	<MachinTrucChose_>	Pidgin is the first one I tried. It's terrible. Maybe for a person who's never going to use IRC these multi-purpose clients are good enough, but not for me
[neutral]	[03:15]	<favoritefood0>	nickrud, I only use ubuntu.
[neutral]	[03:15]	<ffm_>	!language | KyleK
[positive]	[03:15]	<ubotu>	KyleK: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[neutral]	[03:15]	<HardyOne>	!aptcd | moon2js
[negative]	[03:15]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about aptcd - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:15]	<DBautell>	okaratas, howabout @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:15]	<nickrud>	moon2js from an alternate cd, yes
[negative]	[03:15]	<KyleK>	i guess im screwed for using 7.04
[negative]	[03:15]	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; I only had feisty installed.
[neutral]	[03:15]	<damo22>	how can i fix that: sudo: timestamp too far in the future:
[neutral]	[03:15]	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, Use XChat for IRC.
[negative]	[03:15]	<jPratt>	How can i update my Java?
[neutral]	[03:15]	<DBautell>	durn autocomlete
[neutral]	[03:15]	<ffm_>	damo22, sudo -k
[positive]	[03:15]	<KyleK>	ffm_: damn is disney friendly :p
[neutral]	[03:15]	<nosa-J>	theses downloads take forever
[neutral]	[03:16]	<Tailsfan>	!modules
[negative]	[03:16]	<ubotu>	"To compile modules and drivers that are not bundled with the standard kernel,  for more info /msg ubotu kernel  , install the relevant package, usually called ""<modulename>-source"", and run « sudo module-assistant » (you will have to do this again after kernel updates). To prevent specific modules from loading, see /msg ubotu blacklist"
[positive]	[03:16]	<binarybandit>	irssi! :D
[positive]	[03:16]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: I think you'll find there isn't much going on in the way of irc client development, I'd assume the most would be going on in those multi-purpose clients. also, gajim is a jabber only client ;)
[neutral]	[03:16]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 so, try booting a cd. See if you get different action at that level.
[negative]	[03:16]	<MachinTrucChose_>	ffm: that's what I'm using now. I tried like 4-5 clients prior to deciding on X-chat.
[negative]	[03:16]	<favoritefood0>	I'll be right back.
[negative]	[03:16]	<Tailsfan>	Oh
[negative]	[03:16]	<Kl4m>	Shadow_X: server upgrades should never break, except in special situations which you should know about before.
[positive]	[03:16]	<seamus7>	MachinTrucChose_ I'm on IRC via Pidgin ... works nicely
[positive]	[03:16]	<leap>	where is the best torrent site for 8.04 alternate-amd64 cd
[negative]	[03:16]	<moon2js>	alt cd. I have the iso and can burn. can I just insert and it will do, or do I need to some how point update-manager to the disc?
[negative]	[03:16]	<ffm_>	binarybandit, for when you're on the road, yeah.
[positive]	[03:16]	<KyleK>	ffm_: !calmdown > ffm_ :)
[negative]	[03:16]	<bmoll8>	anyone know where I can find a good review of the new ubuntu release
[negative]	[03:16]	<ianliu_88>	How do I remove those shadows/glow from ubuntu windows?
[negative]	[03:16]	<smallfoot->	i should install gnash, swfdec or adobe?
[neutral]	[03:16]	<damo22>	ffm_: it was capital K thanks
[negative]	[03:16]	<nickrud>	moon2js the hardy cd will ask if you want to upgrade when you insert it
[positive]	[03:16]	<ffm_>	bmoll8, It works well, much better than the prior one.
[negative]	[03:16]	<MachinTrucChose_>	basically an IRC client needs to have a decent interface (with a list of users! can't believe some didn't have that), syntax highlighting, DCC sends, CTCP suites, aliases...it's very minimal stuff that was already in mIRC 10 years ago
[neutral]	[03:17]	<osmosis>	whats the difference between nvidia and nvidia_new ?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<black_13>	what would cause ubuntu server install to get stuck scanning mirror stage?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<nickrud>	moon2js the alternate cd, remember
[negative]	[03:17]	<moon2js>	nickrud: but it has to be the alt, not the reg?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<ffm_>	damo22, What?
[neutral]	[03:17]	<seamus7>	ianliu_88: try disabling various compiz plugins in Advanced Desktop Effects
[neutral]	[03:17]	<nickrud>	moon2js yes
[neutral]	[03:17]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: which is why x-chat is your client of choice, it was around 10 years ago, too, iirc.
[negative]	[03:17]	<ffm_>	damo22, Oh.
[neutral]	[03:17]	<damo22>	ffm_: it was capital K .. sudo -K
[neutral]	[03:17]	<nickrud>	black_13 probably server overload
[positive]	[03:17]	<moon2js>	nickrud: cool, thanks!
[neutral]	[03:17]	<woddf2>	I may upgrade tomorrow.
[neutral]	[03:17]	<Daedius_>	hey all
[positive]	[03:17]	<Shadow_X>	Kl4m, i think it was due to ignorance about linux in general. ive learned alot more lately. i used to be daunted by the thought of linux, but now, im comfortable with is. almost as comfy as i am on windows (which i have spent my whole life on, sadly)
[neutral]	[03:17]	<Daedius_>	i'm having trouble with the 2.6.24 kernel
[positive]	[03:17]	<Daedius_>	I'm also a n00b with ubuntu
[negative]	[03:17]	<binarybandit>	ffm_, not just for the road :(
[negative]	[03:17]	<Skuller>	I try booting off a 7.10 live desktop CD but after the orange bar going back and forth it just leaves me at a command prompt kind of place with a 'busybox' title at the top. This does not happen with a 7.04 CD on the same PC. Any suggestions? I tried ctrl-alt-F4 with no luck and neither with F6
[neutral]	[03:17]	<shane2peru>	what advantage is there having the DVD?  More packages, is it the alternate CD and the DesktopCD install wrapped into one?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<Daedius_>	anyonek know the quickest route I should go to get the 2.6.25 kernel on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<Daedius_>	for 64bit system
[positive]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, If you have a fast internet connection, the DVD offers little adcantage.
[negative]	[03:18]	<nickrud>	Daedius_ the only way is compiling it yourself
[negative]	[03:18]	<Kl4m>	"bmoll8: @HLINK is a ""review"" but don't go there if you want a critic"
[negative]	[03:18]	<shane2peru>	Skuller, do you have the 8.04 CD???  Hardy, it is just out
[neutral]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	Daedius_, Don't?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<nickrud>	!kernel | Daedius_
[negative]	[03:18]	<ubotu>	Daedius_: The core of the Ubuntu Operating System is the Linux kernel: see @HLINK - You shouldn't have to compile your own, but if you're convinced you do, see @HLINK - For more: /msg ubotu stages
[neutral]	[03:18]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, so there are more packages?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, Yes.
[neutral]	[03:18]	<dragobr_>	isso é um teste
[negative]	[03:18]	<Kl4m>	leap: Get the torrent file pretty much anywhere, you'll get connected to the same torrent
[negative]	[03:18]	<WeeJa1>	Hi guys! any one using vpnc here?
[neutral]	[03:18]	<Daedius_>	hmmm
[negative]	[03:18]	<jPratt>	Ubuntu is all i am running now this morning i also had windows *Laughs at Micro$oft
[neutral]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, But all of them are avalible via the repos.
[negative]	[03:19]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, for like if I wanted to install on other computers that don't have fast internet?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, right
[negative]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, Yeah, for that.
[negative]	[03:19]	<Skuller>	shane2peru: No, I don't at the moment and I don't have the connection speed to download it quickly either, have to do with 7.10 or 7.04 (this one works)
[positive]	[03:19]	<MachinTrucChose_>	daedius: I heard the performance difference is negligible for a desktop user with 64-bit. People on forums seemed to recommend not bothering for now and sticking with 32-bit
[positive]	[03:19]	<eZe>	i just fornated a partition, but fdisk still displays the wring filesystem type, does it need a reboot to recognize that?
[negative]	[03:19]	<leap>	ffound one no seeders
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Kl4m>	WeeJa1: I used to
[positive]	[03:19]	<corbett>	hi, is there anyone who can help me get my maxtor external hard drive mounted and working on ububtu 7.10 - which ive just loaded on pc to replace windows, it worked perfectly fine elsewhere on widows, I think I need to run some checks as dont know why it wont mount
[positive]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	"shane2peru, See also ""apt on cd"""
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Daedius_>	can you guys think of a way I can test the usability of my usb mouse outside of X11?
[negative]	[03:19]	<Rycher>	hey when i try to install under the terminal. I have a problem.... When it ask for the admin password in the terminal, it wont let me type anything.? any ideas..
[negative]	[03:19]	<WeeJa1>	Kl4m: did you use it with a secure token or pre-shared key?
[negative]	[03:19]	<Daedius_>	I don't know if the problem is my kernel or X11 itself
[negative]	[03:19]	<nickrud>	MachinTrucChose_ I ran 64bit in feisty, but switched back to 32 for hardy for that very reason
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Kl4m>	leap: get the official torrent from ubuntu.com
[negative]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	Daedius_, Why would you want to use it out side of X?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	Daedius_, Not off hand.
[negative]	[03:20]	<nickrud>	Daedius_ gpm might do the trick
[negative]	[03:20]	<shane2peru>	SKuhn, hmm, did you order a CD for shipit?  What country are you in?  There is probably a loco group close
[neutral]	[03:20]	<Kl4m>	WeeJa1: PSK.
[negative]	[03:20]	<WeeJa1>	I can't get the Network Manager + vpnc interface to promt me for a secure token input...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<Daedius_>	My usb mouse isn't working on 8.04
[neutral]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	Rycher, Install what?
[positive]	[03:20]	<black_13>	nickrud, is there a way choose a different server?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<HardyOne>	Rycher: you type and dont see the characters?
[negative]	[03:20]	<plik>	shane2peru: mouseon console is handy for cut & paste
[negative]	[03:20]	<Jobias>	Rycher: if you're referring to the fact that the cursor doesn't move in the terminal, that's normal. i believe it's a security feature, so that no one can tell how long your password is
[positive]	[03:20]	<WeeJa1>	Kl4m: I guess its time to read :-)
[negative]	[03:20]	<lopin>	I can't get cdromupgrade to work.
[negative]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	WeeJa1, You mean for your password?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<WeeJa1>	yea

[neutral]	[03:20]	<Kl4m>	WeeJa1: I didn't use network-manager, I connected to my campus wireless and started vpnc in a console

[negative]	[03:21]	<dbristow>	well that tears it.  releases.ubuntu.com's copy of wubu.exe has the same md5sum as the rest I've tried
[neutral]	[03:21]	<black_13>	nickrud i didnt see that on the server install
[neutral]	[03:21]	<WeeJa1>	Kl4m: ill be happy with console
[negative]	[03:21]	<Skuller>	shane2peru: Yes I did

[negative]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	dbristow, What's the issue?
[negative]	[03:21]	<Jobias>	Rycher: what kind of an error are you getting?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, apt on cd?
[negative]	[03:21]	<MachinTrucChose_>	where would I go if I wanted nicer text fonts than the ones included in Ubuntu? Are all of the Windows one proprietary Microsoft stuff or something (Arial, Courier New, Terminal, Verdana, etc)?
[negative]	[03:21]	<lopin>	Why is there no documentation about the server death?

[positive]	[03:21]	<WeeJa1>	ffm_: ill figure it out....acording to vpnc site, that support was added with 0.3 release

[neutral]	[03:21]	<WeeJa1>	ubuntu comes with 0.51
[neutral]	[03:21]	<dbristow>	ffm_: I can't get a copy of wubi.exe that verifies via the MD5SUMS files
[negative]	[03:21]	<DBautell>	To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[positive]	[03:21]	<sean_>	MachinTrucChose_: mstcorefonts I believe is the name
[neutral]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	lopin, @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:21]	<Kl4m>	eklof: It is a supported upgrade path But I don't know anyone who did it actually
[neutral]	[03:21]	<Jobias>	MachinTrucChose_: sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts
[positive]	[03:21]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, that could be very handy, where do I find out about it?  Wouldn't apt on DVD be more efficient. :)
[negative]	[03:21]	<Seven_Six_Two>	I'm wanting to go from 7.04 but I think I might wait a day. anyone done it without major issues?

[negative]	[03:22]	<seamus7>	oops I'm not supposed to poll
[neutral]	[03:22]	<MachinTrucChose_>	thank you guys
[positive]	[03:22]	<eklof>	Kl4m: I need some test-users before me :)
[negative]	[03:22]	<lopin>	twinkie_addict: changing to a closer server will let you get your apt get working, but don't try to upgrade
[negative]	[03:22]	<dmsuperman>	I'm doubting this, but is there anyway to run visual studio on linux? I _really_ like the intellisense features and project management of it, so I either want visual studio in linux or something similar with intellisense (one that learns from your code, not just built in functions)
[positive]	[03:22]	<underdog5004>	lopin, there's nothing to document, so many users trying to download 700+ Mb from a few servers is basically a DDOS against the servers...unintentional, but there you go :)
[neutral]	[03:22]	<dbristow>	all the copies I have have the same, different, md5sum, from funet, mirrors.kernel.org, everywhere
[negative]	[03:22]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, where do I find out more info about the DVD, something to read on it?
[negative]	[03:22]	<plik>	vicmarconi: apparently the last changes were on 22nd
[negative]	[03:22]	<Jobias>	Rycher: that's odd. i don't really know what's wrong. sorry
[negative]	[03:22]	<dbristow>	I think the MD5SUMS file has got to be wrong
[negative]	[03:22]	<black_13>	how do you do during the install process
[neutral]	[03:22]	<lopin>	underdog5004: I definitely know that, I'm a comp sci major...
[neutral]	[03:22]	<nickrud>	Seven_Six_Two it won't hurt to wait a week, let some bugs that weren't found without really widespread use get fixed, and the mirrors to settle down
[neutral]	[03:22]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, hold on..
[negative]	[03:22]	<J-a-k-e>	hi does anyone here know anything about sound in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[03:22]	<underdog5004>	as am I
[negative]	[03:23]	<lopin>	The question is: why is there not a disclaimer on the main site?

[negative]	[03:23]	<J-a-k-e>	hi does anyone here know anything about sound *quality* in ubuntu?
[negative]	[03:23]	<Skuller>	Any problem if I install 7.04 now? I mean as in its not too old or does not have a huge lack of features does it?
[neutral]	[03:23]	<Rycher>	"hmmm... well this person on the fourms told me to run it in ""super user"" mode. Any ideas?"
[neutral]	[03:23]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, @HLINK
[negative]	[03:23]	<Seven_Six_Two>	I noticed they're getting hammered. I had to edit my hosts info just to update
[neutral]	[03:23]	<maco>	j_humphrey: whatss up
[negative]	[03:23]	<MachinTrucChose_>	hardyone: are the microsoft core fonts copyrighted then? ie, they can't be used in the US without breaking the law (however trivially)?
[negative]	[03:23]	<underdog5004>	lopin, why would there be? obviously there's going to be a slowdown when a new release comes out...
[neutral]	[03:23]	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, Mhm.
[negative]	[03:23]	<dbristow>	I'm getting this md5sum for wubi.exe: a96aa69961f3ed80dd7a88fae1e28196  wubi.exe
[positive]	[03:23]	<nickrud>	Skuller nothing wrong with 7.04, and it has 6 more months of support
[positive]	[03:23]	<shane2peru>	ffm_, thanks!, checking it out.
[positive]	[03:23]	<lopin>	underdog5004: This is not a slowdown.  This is a grinding halt
[positive]	[03:23]	<j_humphrey>	maco: So i think that the iwl3945 driver and my router are incompatible
[negative]	[03:23]	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, at least they cannot be redistrubuted. You need a MS licence.
[negative]	[03:23]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, No problem.
[negative]	[03:23]	<HardyOne>	MachinTrucChose_: something like that but doubt Bill is going to knock on your door
[neutral]	[03:23]	<Stroganoff>	MachinTrucChose_ msttcorefonts are freeware, extracted from MS freeware
[positive]	[03:24]	<ffm_>	maco, still helping people?
[neutral]	[03:24]	<j_humphrey>	maco: @HLINK
[negative]	[03:24]	<Kl4m>	eklof: It really shouldn't be more dangerous than, say a debian dist-upgrade. Many entreprise users are going to upgrade from an LTS to another (not today!)
[neutral]	[03:24]	<ffm_>	MachinTrucChose_, Technically a violation, but unlikely to prosicute.
[negative]	[03:24]	<lopin>	underdog5004: And, I'm trying to upgrade from the alt cd, but it keeps locking up...
[negative]	[03:24]	<underdog5004>	lopin, ime, it's been a slowdown...I tried to install libk3b2-mp3 on my gf's lappy...took nearly 5 minutes before it could fetch the package

[negative]	[03:25]	<Gman99999>	my sound is all messed up now that I upgraded to hardy heron, the sound is all raspy and ruffled, why is that?

[negative]	[03:25]	<TheDukeNY>	Does 8.04 no longer include ntfs support?

[negative]	[03:28]	<Kl4m>	MachinTrucChose_: I don't know why they are not included. But they are in a exe, and the license told they can't be modified. That's why it depends on cabextract also.

[neutral]	[03:31]	<VictorB>	Kl4m, canyou try downloading?
[negative]	[03:31]	<sammy>	Arnos: I don't think they do booster floopys like that anymore now that they figure everyone can just dl and burn a cd, or that anyone wanting to do that could just make their own bootable floppy. are you still trying to load the update from usb?
[positive]	[03:31]	<MachinTrucChose>	ah, much nicer :P

A light comes on the keyboard, but my laptop doesn't accept input from it. I tried rebooting with it plugged in, but I had no luck. How can I make this work?
[negative]	[03:37]	<sean_>	They're going to be an updated release, hopefully it'll include the final version.

[negative]	[03:40]	<scorpfromhell>	what is the partial upgrade after upgrade to hardy that's been taking me ages? :(
[neutral]	[03:40]	<Shpook>	ricree: I solved my sound problems in feisty by installing pulseaudio.
[neutral]	[03:40]	<nickrud>	scorpfromhell probably slow servers
[negative]	[03:40]	<Shpook>	ricree: But yeah, before that I had a lot of problems too.
[negative]	[03:40]	<Randocal>	I'm pretty sure I know the answer.... But if I upgrade to hardy, and somehow it breaks something on my system and things aren't working properly there isn't an uninstall option is there?

[negative]	[03:50]	<Kl4m>	osvin: i386 is the safe one, I use x64 but you can run into problems, wait until you have some Linux experience if you don't.

[neutral]	[03:52]	<Starnestommy>	Fdisk_: this is it
[positive]	[03:52]	<jordanjay29>	Kl4m: Which is why I suggested i386. It's the tried and true version for stability on all modern processors.
[neutral]	[03:52]	<DBautell>	here
[negative]	[03:52]	<Shpook>	fyrfaktry: lol Oh, well i understand then lol. I've almost moved just to switch from comcast to cox

[neutral]	[03:53]	<Kl4m>	osvin: I think it runs faster but that's probably a placebo effect
[negative]	[03:53]	<KyleK>	Kl4m: flash wasn't a problem, java was a bit of one with the arduino environment
[negative]	[03:53]	<osvin>	ok
[negative]	[03:53]	<Kl4m>	Yeah BTW how do I get the sun-java-plugin on AMD64?

[neutral]	[03:54]	<Shpook>	Kl4m: I had many issues with java in feisty 64-bit
[negative]	[03:54]	<kilrae>	is it just me, or does the installer seem to lack a way to mount an encrypted volume without erasing what is in it?
[neutral]	[03:54]	<ripps>	So this channel is still open?
[positive]	[03:54]	<obf213>	i heard a rumor a while ago that ubuntu now had one command to install all the mp3 flash restricted stuff etc
[negative]	[03:55]	<jordanjay29>	kilrae: Why don't you mount after installation? So long as you're not installing to that volume
[negative]	[03:55]	<Kl4m>	ripps: are you coming from #ubuntu+1 ? if so you've just been redirected to #ubuntu
[neutral]	[03:55]	<dragobr_>	obf213: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[neutral]	[03:55]	<jordanjay29>	obf213: sudo apt-get ubuntu-restricted-extras
[negative]	[03:55]	<kilrae>	ah, but what if i am installing to an LVM in that volume
[negative]	[03:55]	<Shpook>	ARGH. The anticipation is killing me. Only 5.75 hours left until the upgrade is downloaded.
[negative]	[03:55]	<ripps>	oh, I didn't realize
[neutral]	[03:55]	<jordanjay29>	oops, missed a line, use dragobr's

[neutral]	[03:56]	<famicom>	@HLINK

[positive]	[03:56]	<nickrud>	famicom cuz everyone (including you) is hammering them ;)
[neutral]	[03:56]	<jordanjay29>	famicom: it's release day, and thousands of people are trying to download the latest version. Give it a break and come back in a day or so

[neutral]	[03:56]	<warriorforgod>	famicom: they are not dead.  Many people are download 8.04 using up a lot of bandwidth.
[negative]	[03:56]	<osvin>	kelvin91: I use compiz

[neutral]	[03:57]	<Shpook>	!offtopic
[neutral]	[03:57]	<ubotu>	#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[negative]	[03:57]	<Surrealwraith>	Yeah, the download took hours
[neutral]	[03:57]	<twinkie_addict>	torent is fast
[negative]	[03:57]	<calc>	famicom: aiui the servers do at least several gigabit, so for them to be overloaded means large amounts of people are downloading

[negative]	[03:57]	<famicom>	Kl4m does that have the sources

[negative]	[03:57]	<johd>	anyone know how i can remove swfdec plugin so that firefox will stop using it
[negative]	[03:57]	<szx0>	Is there a way to kick every other users off a server besides yourself ?
[neutral]	[03:57]	<Darkphyre>	can anyone please tell me how to force a resolution in this new xorg server? it isn't letting me edit the xorg.conf as much as i used to.
[neutral]	[03:57]	<nickrud>	famicom system->admin -> software sources , download from : choose other, and a local mirror
[neutral]	[03:57]	<calc>	famicom: then use a mirror
[negative]	[03:57]	<kelvin911>	osvin: it is not that visible sometimes
[neutral]	[03:57]	<doolz>	Darkphyre, what graphics card?
[positive]	[03:57]	<kelvin911>	osvin: but it isnt as smooth as it is in windows
[neutral]	[03:57]	<nickrud>	!attitude | famicom
[positive]	[03:57]	<ubotu>	famicom: The people here are volunteers, your attitude should reflect that. Answers are not always available. See @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:58]	<p28301016>	how can i upgrade to the hardy version with ap-get
[negative]	[03:58]	<Surrealwraith>	Mine cut out after 30 seconds.  I called and they said Ubuntu is illegal anyway, so I should stop trying...
[negative]	[03:58]	<jordanjay29>	Surrealwraith: You sure? I just adjusted my settings, closed my lid and opened again. It does nothing, as I instructed it too. And, yeah, comcast is a pain in the [you know where] for torrents.
[neutral]	[03:58]	<famicom>	!care | nickrud
[negative]	[03:58]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about care - try searching on @HLINK

[negative]	[03:58]	<famicom>	calc next time make sure your brain is in gear before engaging mouth
[negative]	[03:59]	<kelvin911>	i wonder if it is compiz that is causing it
[positive]	[03:59]	<calc>	famicom: if you just use a country code server it probably points back to the main server as well, eg us.archive.ubuntu.com points at archive.ubuntu.com
[positive]	[03:59]	<p28301016>	thanks nickruk
[neutral]	[03:59]	<doolz>	Darkphyre, do you have nvidia-settings installed?

[negative]	[04:29]	<nickrud>	arbir_ arbir_ first, because the instructions pointed to that. Second, the boot sector isn't in dev/sdb1, but on /dev/sdb

[negative]	[04:30]	<matt_>	hey, whenever I run apt-get install something on 8.04, I get a bunch of perl locale errors
[negative]	[04:30]	<harriseldon>	CaptainMorgan are you behind a proxy?

[negative]	[04:30]	<arbir_>	nickrud:  should i make a ext3 partition ?
[neutral]	[04:30]	<nickrud>	arbir_ the device itself. sdb1 is the first partition on the device. There's always some empty space at the beginning of the device (outside of sdb1) for the mbr and boot flag

[neutral]	[04:32]	<harriseldon>	CaptainMorgan according to this @HLINK it is connection related -- could be increased traffic

[negative]	[04:32]	<nickrober>	Utalcn2me: oh, mine is just scratchy, like using distortion with an electric guitar

[negative]	[04:32]	<arbir_>	nickrud:  i am happy.. but just to know, should i keep the USB stick's partition as FAT32 or shall i change it to EXT3 ?
[negative]	[04:32]	<calc>	bthornton: amd64 would probably work better for you, especially if you have a lot of ram

[positive]	[04:32]	<RyanPrior>	Is there a program for doing sound captures of whatever is playing on the computer?
[negative]	[04:32]	<arbir_>	nickrud:  @HLINK   <--preparing using the shell script there
[negative]	[04:33]	<Utalcn2me>	nickrober, try turning down pcm maybe, i notice mine distorts when its too high.
[neutral]	[04:33]	<kelvin911>	calc: for example?

[negative]	[04:33]	<tarkus>	i want to use ubuntu for my server, but it has caused nothing but problems.. i get hundreds of locale and perl warnings, postgres doesnt work, there arent any logs, nothing is working, simply put. is there any reason why fresh installs of ubuntu would be so shit right out of the box? its the ubuntu server version, and its 7.10 (gutsy)
[neutral]	[04:33]	<purpleposeidon>	!wubi
[positive]	[04:33]	<ubotu>	wubi is Wubi advice here: @HLINK  and  @HLINK  [file wubi bugs here:  @HLINK ] (it is included in hardy 8.04 beta CD and will be in the final release)
[negative]	[04:33]	<calc>	kelvin911: OOo 2.4.0 instead of 2.3.0

[negative]	[04:33]	<nickrober>	Utalcn2me: i have the volume really low, but it's scratchy constantly, someone else with a computer similar to mine has the same problem on the forums so i guess i'll just wait for a fix :(
[negative]	[04:33]	<RyanPrior>	tarkus: That's really strange. My Ubuntu install works fine with Perl stuff, and I'm not using Postgres, but MySQL runs fine.
[negative]	[04:33]	<pipegeek>	So, how does the upgrade tool determine which version of ubuntu you have installed?  It thinks I already have Hardy, and it's dead wrong.
[negative]	[04:34]	<harriseldon>	arbir_ that should be fine -- are you doing full install to usb or just using a writable partition?
[neutral]	[04:34]	<Prez00>	regular CD
[negative]	[04:34]	<owen1>	"""enable automatic login"" doesn't work(xubuntu) . any ideas?"

[negative]	[04:35]	<RyanPrior>	pipegeek: That is very strange. I don't know what the package manager decides based on, but it's clearly screwed up somehow.
[negative]	[04:35]	<Adlai>	d4t4min3r: rm -rf /tmp/*, but I wouldn't suggest it, many programs use temp space while they are running

[negative]	[04:39]	<Adlai>	I don't remember who was asking about finding the fastest mirror, but it's netselect that you want to use, I believ
[negative]	[04:39]	<Kl4m>	zcat[1]: did you use a torrent. If so, then it's validated by the torrent protocol.
[negative]	[04:39]	<talcite>	oh the distro upgrade? yeah its kinda broken for me as well. Probably due to server load

[negative]	[04:54]	<mattycoze>	harriseldon no, it's not in the menu
[positive]	[04:54]	<arbir_>	yippeeeee , USB installation works
[negative]	[04:54]	<arbir_>	USB key is amazingly fast, no more CD burning for mre
[neutral]	[04:54]	<jburd>	the installer hangs EVERY freaking time there's a new release.
[neutral]	[04:54]	<kelvin911>	n000b: try plug it back in to the windows, then remove the usb properly then ubuntu can detect it automatically
[negative]	[04:54]	<fiz1>	hey everybody, i have a problem with my on screen volume display, it used to be a small rectangle that appeared when i pressed the volume up button on my laptop, now it is a big square and i want to set it back
[neutral]	[04:54]	<n000b>	kelvin can we chat directly
[negative]	[04:54]	<Jack_Sparrow>	n000b, You can force a mount, but way better to properly close it from windows,
[negative]	[04:54]	<mattycoze>	"harriseldon; if you mean ""Hardware Drivers"" i've got that up"
[negative]	[04:54]	<snadge>	after you've installed ubuntu hardy, how do you tell it to use the generic IDE driver?
[neutral]	[04:55]	<kelvin911>	n000b: or force mount
[neutral]	[04:55]	<nhaines>	fiz1: You can o that by using Add/Remove and installing Advanced Desktop Effects.
[negative]	[04:55]	<kelvin911>	n000b: i did that with my 3 external HD
[neutral]	[04:55]	<mattycoze>	harriseldon; by which in it i've only got the NVIDIA drivers working
[neutral]	[04:55]	<nhaines>	fiz1: You can turn off the volume control plugin for Compiz there, I believe.
[negative]	[04:55]	<cob>	wow wine has gotten really good, didn't even have to mess with any configuration

[negative]	[04:55]	<n000b>	kelvin911: how do i remove the hdd properly?
[positive]	[04:55]	<tale_>	what is the name of the new clock applet package
[negative]	[04:56]	<harriseldon>	mattycoze it may have changed names in hardy. do you see a placeholder for your 4965 wireless card? if so, is it checked?
[positive]	[04:56]	<Mimi>	...Uuuummmm.... how can I stop all desktop icons from showing.... without making my background disapear? Thanks ;p
[negative]	[04:56]	<neeto>	My GRUB menu still says 7.10. It's not functionally important, but I want to know how to fix it.
[negative]	[04:56]	<snadge>	Jack_Sparrow: yeah but how do i tell it to use generic IDE? i can do it from the install cd.. but not sure what option to put in my menu.lst
[positive]	[04:56]	<nhaines>	pipegeek: update-manager passes everything over to a special release upgrade tool that does dependancy checking and so forth.
[negative]	[04:56]	<mattycoze>	harriseldon no there is no placeholder for the card :(
[negative]	[04:56]	<quentusrex>	Does anyone know about the color bug on hardy? I think it has something to do with either the nvidia driver or something similiar.

[negative]	[04:57]	<kelvin911>	n000b: right click that, then choose whatever device or letter ur usb hd using.  then click remove or whatever
[negative]	[04:57]	<pipegeek>	nhaines: doesn't aptitude do dependency checking?  Not to mention, update-manager seems to have screwed up again (happened for gutsy and for feisty, both times had to reinstall), and thinks it's already installed hardy, which it hasn't (no packages installed; lsb_release still says gutsy)
[negative]	[04:57]	<ceil420>	"Why do I keep seeing this message? It annoys me every time I try to upgrade packages... ""The following packages have been kept back:  gnome-themes-extras"""

[positive]	[04:58]	<quentusrex>	There is something wrong with the video playback on my system. I have hardy from RC fully updated. It has just recently 'broke'
[negative]	[04:58]	<Kalimar>	I'm having problems with Samba and HH.  I can have the network and the windows computers enumerated, but not their shares.  There is no message saying that Ubuntu cannot access the shares.  What's the deal?

[neutral]	[04:58]	<n000b>	kelvin911: done
[neutral]	[04:58]	<nhaines>	pipegeek: the upgrade tool knows exactly what needs to be done to ensure a proper update, such as removing deprcated packages and so forth.
[neutral]	[04:58]	<x1250>	ceil420: try # aptitude full-upgrade

[negative]	[04:59]	<pipegeek>	nhaines: but it's *wrong*.  I mean, it clearly doesn't---it says no upgrade is necessary, and it's wrong about that.  I don't know how it's checking.

[negative]	[04:59]	<nhaines>	pipegeek: I understand that, but that doesn't change that dist-upgrade is not supported.
[negative]	[04:59]	<ceil420>	"x1250, that's gonna let me get the package, but why is it forcing removal of a different one? ""The following packages will be automatically REMOVED:  gtk2-engines-spherecrystal"""

[neutral]	[05:00]	<nhaines>	pipegeek: See what 'lsb_release -r' says, and set your /etc/apt/sources.list back to using gutsy repos.

[neutral]	[05:01]	<pipegeek>	nhaines: lsb_release still says 7.10
[negative]	[05:01]	<Kl4m>	ceil420: A package is automatically removed when it was only a dependency on another package which was removed. It then becomes useless
[positive]	[05:01]	<Kalimar>	What does it mean when I'm able to see the windows computers listed under network, but when I click on them, the shares are not enumerated and I do not receive an error message?
[neutral]	[05:01]	<hellmitre>	how would I go about enabling wireless?
[negative]	[05:01]	<harriseldon>	mattycoze is your wireless recognized without restricted drivers? do you know how to check?

[positive]	[05:03]	<x1250>	bladezor: thats because you should have download it yesterday. Today is release party!
[negative]	[05:03]	<nhaines>	fiz1: It looks like the volume control is actually a GNOME feature when compositing is enabled.  There doesn't appear to be a way to disable it.
[positive]	[05:04]	<mattycoze>	harriseldon yeah it's on mate :P
[negative]	[05:04]	<bladezor>	x1250: Yeah, shame on me :(

[negative]	[05:05]	<talcite>	sap: oh =/
[negative]	[05:05]	<Kl4m>	thezanke: you need to edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file for this. Let me see the simplest way.

[positive]	[05:05]	<Deiz>	So, as with every time I install Ubuntu, windows maximize to both my monitors instead of one. Is there a workaround? I recall with 7.04 I got lucky after a reboot and it started working properly.
[negative]	[05:05]	<bladezor>	x1250, yeah I didn't notice how
[negative]	[05:05]	<led3234>	mostly stuff like word, powerpoint

[negative]	[05:06]	<Flannel>	led3234: listening to music you mean?  and what sorts of languages?
[positive]	[05:06]	<nhaines>	led3234: It's actually a quite pleasant change if you mostly do email, browse the Web, and do Office stuff.  You can always download a Desktop CD and try things out a bit without installing.

[negative]	[05:08]	<harriseldon>	owen1 as long as you know the ip of the server, the ip of the client can be dynamic
[negative]	[05:08]	<ricree>	n000b: as far as I know, the only huge difference is that it uses KDE instead of gnome
[negative]	[05:08]	<Kalimar>	Samba trouble.  My windows computers are recognized, but when I click on them, they are devoid of shares.  What's wrong?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Kl4m>	"thezanke: in the first lines of the file /boot/grub/menu.lst (edit it as a superuser, see !sudo), change the line ""default      0"" to ""default    saved"". Reboot, select Windows and from now on it will be the default"
[negative]	[05:08]	<Flannel>	n000b: They're different.  Neither has advantages per sey, just a matter of preference.
[negative]	[05:08]	<nhaines>	n000b: There are no advantages.  It uses the KDE desktop environments instead of the GNOME desktop environment.  It's just about preferences.  They can both run run the same programs.
[negative]	[05:08]	<maap_rj>	somebody updated to ubuntu 8.04?
[negative]	[05:08]	<talcite>	n000b: its a preference thing. If you're used to KDE, then its better
[negative]	[05:09]	<led3234>	oh ok, but i thought there was that new thing in the update (kubi, i think) that lets me run ubuntu from windows (as an application), should i try it?

[negative]	[05:10]	<ricree>	led3234: you can burn it, the download link should have the iso
[negative]	[05:10]	<led3234>	oh ok
[negative]	[05:10]	<talcite>	manuel__: k. Yeah, don't use jigdo jigdo. It doesn't work very well yet. Use jigit and then use jigdo-lite (I think that's what its called)

[negative]	[05:11]	<Kl4m>	thezanke: you can remove the group of lines for each entry you don't want around the end of that file (oh boy I shouldn't be telling you that)
[negative]	[05:11]	<Kalimar>	Nope, is there one?
[neutral]	[05:11]	<maap_rj>	I really hope not be necessary re-configurate so many things manually

[positive]	[05:12]	<nhaines>	thezanke: the best way is to remove the kernel packages using Synaptic.  It's a good idea to leave the old one around for a week or so, just in case you find any bugs.  :)
[positive]	[05:12]	<maap_rj>	this is my first time using a IRC chat... lol it is cool
[negative]	[05:12]	<cob>	"Larry: what does ""ifconfig"" say"
[neutral]	[05:12]	<cob>	er Lainy
[negative]	[05:13]	<Flannel>	thezanke: You can't remove them permanently, they'll show up as soon as you update your kernel again.  What you want to do is remove old kernel packages, then those entries won't be there anymore.  It's always a good idea to have two kernels (a known good one, and then the new one you just updated to) in case you find bugs
[negative]	[05:13]	<pawbie>	Really hating 8.04 atm. :\
[negative]	[05:13]	<Kl4m>	"nhaines: do they become ""autoremovable"" after a while?"
[positive]	[05:13]	<nhaines>	"thezanke: Also, remember that PgDn will get you to the Windows XP entry quickly!  Or, you can move Windows XP to the top and change the default boot option from ""0"" (first) to ""1"" (second)."

[negative]	[05:14]	<harriseldon>	mattycoze sorry to leave you hanging. have you checked for errors in any of the system logs regarding your wireless. If it worked before, it seems to be a firmware loading issue.

[negative]	[05:27]	<pipegeek>	Interesting.  So, when update-manager fails, do-release-upgrade which uses the same underpinnings, may succeed.

[neutral]	[05:28]	<Flannel>	arooni: now; except you'll be waiting forever on slow mirrors.  Give it a few days.
[negative]	[05:28]	<nhaines>	arooni: It should work right now, but I'd advise you to wait a week or at least a couple days.
[negative]	[05:28]	<grumbel>	Did anything special happen with the /dev/hd* files? Since it looks like I have lost them all after the dist-upgrade

[negative]	[05:32]	<pawbie>	coldboot: Oh!  It's called bulk rename.  Should be under system tools, I think (atleast, it is in Debian).
[positive]	[05:32]	<Flannel>	grumbel: well, the orders will determine what letters they get, but UUIDs makes it not matter for fstab
[negative]	[05:32]	<Diurpaneus>	I have a problem with 8.04. When I start a web page which use flash player I receive an image with play button, how can I remove this play button? Please help!

[negative]	[05:33]	<manuel__>	ripps: Ok let me see if that works
[negative]	[05:33]	<nhaines>	dave11: No.  Try installing Ubuntu Restricted Extras with Add/Remove.

[neutral]	[05:42]	<harriseldon>	jeffimperial, just create a new directory and use the full path as the mount point
[negative]	[05:42]	<neeto>	kindofabuzz: figured it was something like that

[neutral]	[05:43]	<Sniper606>	i think they are down
[negative]	[05:43]	<Flannel>	jeffimperial: mountpoint would be an arbitrary place in your filesystem that you wanted the ISO to be mounted to (so you browse to /whatever/your/mountpoint/is/ to view the contents of the CD/iso)

[negative]	[05:51]	<harriseldon>	blueeyesmike it looks like it may be somewhere in the script. can you run the script manually in a shell with sudo? if that doesn't work, try exiting your gui session and doing it from a terminal session ctrl-alt-f1 and see if that works. from looking at my script it does a lot of checking for active x sessions

[negative]	[06:00]	<morphy>	still fighting hard to get to make USB install for 8.04.. any more suggestions ?
[negative]	[06:01]	<KyleK>	maap_rj: shoulda started earlier or waited for hardy

[negative]	[06:01]	<pawbie>	I haven't even managed to boot 8.04 yet....  :(
[neutral]	[06:01]	<loufoque>	jim_beam: you must install from a 64 bit CD
[neutral]	[06:01]	<IcemanV9>	McHearty: try Canadian
[negative]	[06:01]	<loufoque>	jim_beam: yes, that sucks.
[negative]	[06:01]	<crdlb>	maap_rj: please join #compiz-fusion
[positive]	[06:01]	<crdlb>	that's very easy to fix
[negative]	[06:01]	<^V^>	pawbie: what is the problem?
[neutral]	[06:01]	<jim_beam>	the standard linux kernel has a flag for 64bit support is that the same w=(with sym processing)

[negative]	[06:01]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I entered it in, it backed up the original and said that videooverlay and open gloverlay don't affect running session.  Should I restart?
[neutral]	[06:02]	<pawbie>	I think the installer is counting my hardware RAID as 2 separate disks.
[negative]	[06:02]	<morphy>	it really sux.. I want to install 8.04 and I dont have a cdrom to boot from :/
[negative]	[06:02]	<Mickey>	it starts the install, stops, and says it can't access the servers

[neutral]	[06:02]	<McHearty>	woot?
[positive]	[06:02]	<nhaines>	Mickey: The servers are being hammered today.
[negative]	[06:02]	<fysa>	There are no daily-live mirrors.

[negative]	[06:02]	<morphy>	I have an iso and I am trying to use that to make a USB bootable and am failing big time
[negative]	[06:02]	<Kurtis->	I imagine because everyone's asking about 8.04 now
[positive]	[06:02]	<loufoque>	McHearty: lots of people are upgrading to hardy at the moment, hence the issues.
[negative]	[06:02]	<morphy>	:/
[neutral]	[06:02]	<bbyever>	i get an I/O error message when trying to upgrade from a cd
[neutral]	[06:03]	<pawbie>	nhaines: I'm actually celebrating the issues.
[positive]	[06:03]	<amirman84>	does anyone have a link to a page that explains all the different boot options for an ubuntu/windows dual installation?
[negative]	[06:03]	<McHearty>	I should have just sat on the alpha build -_-
[negative]	[06:03]	<MeatGrinder>	can someone give me checksum for the alternate
[neutral]	[06:03]	<McHearty>	woot for shitty broadcom
[negative]	[06:03]	<loufoque>	morphy: booting from an usb stick is fairly difficult
[negative]	[06:03]	<jtmonz>	bbyever: same here... i switched servers
[negative]	[06:03]	<pawbie>	I can't remember the last time a modern server got literally pounded out of operation for a Linux distro.

[positive]	[06:03]	<morphy>	loufoque, not until the 7.04.. it could be achieved in a jiffy..
[positive]	[06:04]	<McHearty>	Oh, and I love how the ubuntu help page still refers to pidgin as gaim
[negative]	[06:04]	<McHearty>	That's gotta be good for the newbies
[neutral]	[06:04]	<doolz>	amirman84, @HLINK
[negative]	[06:04]	<morphy>	its just this version that I am facing this problem :(
[negative]	[06:04]	<pawbie>	nhaines: I don't remember it being this bad for the last 2 releases.
[negative]	[06:04]	<Toran>	"I was in the middle of upgrading to hardy with update-manager and I had to cancel it (it was in the ""downloading packages"" stage). What should I do to continue the upgrade?"
[negative]	[06:04]	<bbyever>	jtmonz: so i should download again?
[positive]	[06:04]	<KyleK>	maap_rj: everyones messing with 8.04 today
[positive]	[06:04]	<pawbie>	Toran: restart the update manager
[neutral]	[06:04]	<devin_>	last two releases weren't LTS
[neutral]	[06:04]	<nhaines>	pawbie: It was pretty close.  A day or two and it'll clear back up again.  It takes a week or so before it really gets better.
[negative]	[06:04]	<amirman84>	pawbie: i'm specifically looking for alternatives to using just grub
[negative]	[06:04]	<pawbie>	devin_: Zactly.  Nor did they feature wubi and the new AD thingie.
[positive]	[06:05]	<jtmonz>	bbyever: i would just switch servers... it was easy to do in synaptic
[neutral]	[06:05]	<Sciri>	McHearty: Which page? On the Web site? I can poke someone about it.
[neutral]	[06:05]	<gogeta>	amirman84 floppy disk supergrub cd
[neutral]	[06:05]	<McHearty>	Hang on I'll link you
[neutral]	[06:05]	<MeatGrinder>	oh joy, i have 5.4k download on the alternate torrent...only 27 more hours to go!
[positive]	[06:05]	<therealnanotube>	pawbie: ehrm... the slashdot effect happens every day. :)  though probably it's mostly bandwidth saturation rather than server pounding per se.
[neutral]	[06:05]	<McHearty>	Sciri: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:05]	<pawbie>	amirman84:  Why?
[neutral]	[06:05]	<Schypher_>	air/join #wpa_supplicant
[negative]	[06:05]	<Toran>	pawbie: it doesn't recognize that there is a new version of ubuntu out, now. It just has a huge list of packages to upgrade as if I weren't doing a dist upgrade
[neutral]	[06:05]	<XceII>	only 27?
[neutral]	[06:05]	<Sciri>	McHearty: ta, I'll poke newz tomorrow morning.
[negative]	[06:05]	<maccam94>	"is it possible to do a ""clean"" install of ubuntu without formatting? (leaving /home the way it is, and no i don't want to go into making a separate home)"
[negative]	[06:05]	<bbyever>	what do you mean just switch servers...
[neutral]	[06:06]	<pawbie>	maccam94: Ya.  Make a new partition, cp -r /home to the new partition, and mount the new partition as your /home during install.
[negative]	[06:06]	<gogeta>	maccam94 yep if you have a /home partation
[neutral]	[06:06]	<therealnanotube>	maccam94: back up /home to external drive, make clean install, move /home back.
[neutral]	[06:06]	<gogeta>	maccam94 just format /
[negative]	[06:06]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, still doesn't work....
[negative]	[06:06]	<Kurtis->	amirman84: Which are you trying to dual-boot?
[negative]	[06:06]	<nhaines>	maccam94: Not without making a seperate /home partition.
[negative]	[06:06]	<KyleK>	maccam94: boot the live cd and delete everything thats not /home, and then partition manually
[negative]	[06:06]	<amirman84>	pawbie, gogeta: i wonder if i can use the windows bootloader to point to grub on my linux partition instead of having to overwrite the mbr with grub
[neutral]	[06:06]	<Kurtis->	XP or Vista?
[neutral]	[06:06]	<KyleK>	maccam94: then dont click format
[neutral]	[06:06]	<McHearty>	ta-ta
[neutral]	[06:06]	<IcemanV9>	MeatGrinder: it'll speed up soon
[neutral]	[06:06]	<gogeta>	amirman84 kinda
[positive]	[06:06]	<jtmonz>	.mx == mexico? just use another north american server... go in to synaptic or adept manager and change the default server from there
[neutral]	[06:06]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Have a look at how Wubi uses grub4dos to do that.
[neutral]	[06:06]	<Kurtis->	amirman84: You can, but it requires some third party tools
[positive]	[06:06]	<amirman84>	kurtis: xp media center
[neutral]	[06:06]	<Fishscene>	Windows bootloaders only recognize Windows OS's
[neutral]	[06:06]	<ripps>	AdrianStrays: can you post your xorg.conf?
[neutral]	[06:06]	<MeatGrinder>	IcemanV9, ok thanks
[positive]	[06:06]	<Kurtis->	Debian has an article how to use ntldr with bootpart
[negative]	[06:07]	<fysa>	if you have an old version..  you can try to use rsync to update it based on differences.
[neutral]	[06:07]	<cob>	Fishscene: not true...I've booted linux from Windows' bootloader
[neutral]	[06:07]	<jim_beam>	is there a keep connection alive program
[positive]	[06:07]	<cob>	due to a corporate requirement
[positive]	[06:07]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I forgot the command to display it.
[negative]	[06:07]	<jtmonz>	yeah, it's called wubi
[neutral]	[06:07]	<Kurtis->	amirman84: @HLINK
[negative]	[06:07]	<Fishscene>	cob, seriously? Do you have an article I could follow?
[neutral]	[06:07]	<rkvirani>	hey all
[positive]	[06:07]	<gogeta>	thers a way to boot it one ext3 to
[neutral]	[06:07]	<nhaines>	hey, rkvirani.
[neutral]	[06:07]	<rkvirani>	just downloaded the latest and installed it
[neutral]	[06:07]	<jtmonz>	Fishscene: install it with wubi
[neutral]	[06:07]	<gogeta>	using windows boot
[negative]	[06:07]	<LainIwakura>	Can someone help me with my Internet connection? I can't get it to work, but it worked in Gutsy. I have a broadcom 4311 and the wiki page isn't helpful.
[neutral]	[06:07]	<pipegeek>	Ah.  Was using mirrors.kernel.org, which is a week behind.
[neutral]	[06:07]	<IcemanV9>	MeatGrinder: it usually starts slowly, then speed up quickly
[positive]	[06:07]	<rkvirani>	downloaded the nvidia driver and the shadow for compiz is PINK!
[neutral]	[06:07]	<Fishscene>	jtmonz, that's cheating :|
[neutral]	[06:07]	<gogeta>	been a long time sence i tryed
[neutral]	[06:07]	<jtmonz>	(i think it's the last option when you boot the cd)
[negative]	[06:08]	<rkvirani>	any ideas?
[positive]	[06:08]	<KyleK>	rkvirani: we're not a forum, we dont really need introductions ;)
[neutral]	[06:08]	<bbyever>	jtmonz: but how would that make a difference? i checked de md5sum and it was correct...
[neutral]	[06:08]	<harriseldon>	amirman84 you can change the boot.ini to boot into grub -- I have done it before with lilo many eons ago
[neutral]	[06:08]	<amirman84>	what are the config files for wubi's bootloader called?
[negative]	[06:08]	<devin_>	minus the fact that 8.04 server released also don't help speed things up any
[neutral]	[06:08]	<pawbie>	Lots of bcm43xx issues tonight.
[neutral]	[06:08]	<cob>	Fishscene: would be happy to google it up but currently waiting on ff to download java jre and with the apt repos all tied up with 8.04 install activity it's ttaking forever
[neutral]	[06:08]	<rkvirani>	KyleK: pardon me?
[neutral]	[06:08]	<KyleK>	rkvirani: what'd you break?
[neutral]	[06:08]	<harriseldon>	amirman84 I will search online and let you know
[negative]	[06:08]	<cob>	pawbie: 8.04 release fudged broadcom up worse than beta
[negative]	[06:08]	<jtmonz>	Fishscene: ohh, you want a separate partition
[negative]	[06:08]	<rkvirani>	rkvirani: nothing...
[negative]	[06:08]	<KyleK>	ah
[negative]	[06:08]	<amirman84>	harriseldon: that's what i'm wanting to do, i think.
[neutral]	[06:08]	<LainIwakura>	I'm having trouble with broadcom yes
[positive]	[06:08]	<maccam94>	KyleK: have you personally done it? as i remember in 7.10 it wouldn't let you proceed without formatting /
[neutral]	[06:08]	<ripps>	AdrianStays: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:08]	<rkvirani>	just installed the NVIDIA driver.
[negative]	[06:08]	<crdlb>	rkvirani: that's a well-known nvidia driver bug:/
[negative]	[06:08]	<MeatGrinder>	IcemanV9, does it matter which client I use? I'm using getright right now.
[negative]	[06:08]	<Fishscene>	cob, no problem. I have to go now anyway, but I'll see if I can look into it anyway. Thanks for the heads up though. I hate giving out false info.
[negative]	[06:08]	<jtmonz>	bbyever: i couldn't get my 8.04 cd to mount for some reason... so i just swithced servers... do whatever you feel like though
[negative]	[06:08]	<pawbie>	cob: Ya?  Crap.  I have a friend that's downloading 8.04 in hopes of getting his bcm43xx up and running.
[neutral]	[06:08]	<rkvirani>	crdlb: what can be done?
[negative]	[06:08]	<LainIwakura>	cob, did you get my pastebin?
[negative]	[06:08]	<Maxdamantus>	I'm installing 8.04 onto a virtual machine in VMWare, using XFS as the root partition. The installer stopped at 94% (it warned me GRUB has problems with XFS), so I closed it, installed GRUB myself (from the `grub` prompt), and was able to boot to the GRUB command line. However, the installer hadn't got to making my grub.conf yet. Could someone pastebin theirs for me (I'll figure out what to edit)
[negative]	[06:08]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, no I know paste bin, I forgot how to bring xorg.conf up
[neutral]	[06:08]	<james_>	hi
[positive]	[06:09]	<rkvirani>	it worked fine prior to 8.04 release
[negative]	[06:09]	<crdlb>	rkvirani: you could turn off the shadows entirely I guess
[negative]	[06:09]	<KyleK>	maccam94: thats odd, well you could debootstrap maybe
[neutral]	[06:09]	<IcemanV9>	MeatGrinder: it shouldn't matter
[negative]	[06:09]	<rkvirani>	crdlb: alright
[positive]	[06:09]	<rkvirani>	thanks
[neutral]	[06:09]	<cob>	Lainlwakura: no can you paste url again please?

[negative]	[06:09]	<mattycoze>	hey does anyone know whether the Envy works in Ubuntu 8.04
[neutral]	[06:09]	<ripps>	AdrianStarys: From terminal -> gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[neutral]	[06:09]	<LainIwakura>	cob: Okay, thanks.
[positive]	[06:10]	<pawbie>	derenrich: XGL/AIGLX available?
[neutral]	[06:10]	<LoLeN>	does sb have a torrent link for ubuntu x386 desktop edition (DVD) ?
[negative]	[06:10]	<ceil420>	why does Hardy include emacs? vim is clearly superior...
[neutral]	[06:10]	<crdlb>	derenrich: what video card?
[negative]	[06:10]	<pawbie>	"derenrich:  run ""compiz --replace"" from terminal and see if you get errors."
[negative]	[06:10]	<LoLeN>	i cant get into the ubuntu website
[neutral]	[06:10]	<derenrich>	nvidia
[positive]	[06:10]	<harriseldon>	amirman84 @HLINK It looks like a pretty good guide, but make sure to have backups of boot.ini and an xp disk handy to repair master boot record if you make a mistake
[positive]	[06:10]	<therealnanotube>	how's multi-monitor support on hardy? nice and easy to set up, or still requires fiddling a lot with xorg.conf?
[neutral]	[06:10]	<pawbie>	LoLeN: @HLINK

[neutral]	[06:10]	<jim_beam>	can u upgrade from 7.1 to hardy with dvd
[neutral]	[06:10]	<drivetrax>	there we go

[negative]	[06:11]	<ceil420>	and why isn't an upgrade for libconfuse included? ><

When I run ""update-grub"" I think it sees the new kernel (which I assume is 2.6.24-16) and says ""updating list... done"" but in reality it doesn't modify the list. Could anyone help me?"
[negative]	[06:15]	<talcite>	nickrud: oh =S. Err how should I do that?

[negative]	[06:23]	<jeffimperia1>	i tried running the cdromupgrade md5 using terminal. the terminal comes up then disappears instantly.. what to do?
[negative]	[06:23]	<ceil420>	FastZ, if you're asking why i mention it to you, it's because you also mentioned a new package in the install
[negative]	[06:23]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: i see. i'm on a bcm43-something card. not sure how to see the info on it?
[negative]	[06:23]	<LoLeN>	"when i reboot the pc i have to always type ""modprobe ndiswrapper && depmod -a"" to get my wireless to work, why is that??"
[negative]	[06:23]	<gogeta>	nickrud lol i cant even keep up
[negative]	[06:23]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Probably, but I'm an efficiency guy myself...
[neutral]	[06:23]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: lspci -v
[neutral]	[06:24]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: 2.6.24.-16-generic
[positive]	[06:24]	<nickrud>	gogeta I don't try, I track a couple people at a time :)
[positive]	[06:24]	<unop>	FastZ, i think it was fiesty when it was introducted, i can't be sure
[neutral]	[06:24]	<^V^>	nickrud: @HLINK
[positive]	[06:24]	<morphy>	brb.. checking the new install guide I found if it works
[negative]	[06:24]	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: It's my experience that Compiz pushes your hardware too much, try disabling it.
[neutral]	[06:24]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: that's using the new wireless stack. You should be using b43 if possible
[neutral]	[06:24]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: here it is - BCM4328 802.11a/b/g/n
[negative]	[06:24]	<FastZ>	ceil420: oh, i couldnt tell ya why some packages are installed by default.  unop said something about the server version being a LAMP server installation by default.
[negative]	[06:24]	<mattycoze>	"amirman84 i get this from planet mirror; Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead. (plus a whole load of ""failed to fetch"")"
[negative]	[06:24]	<pawbie>	LoLeN:  Check your restricted modules and see if it's set to load.
[neutral]	[06:24]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: what chipset is your wireless using?
[negative]	[06:24]	<samliu>	hmm compiz only pushes your computer too much if you have a crappy gfx card...
[neutral]	[06:24]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: lspci -v
[positive]	[06:24]	<Shadow_X>	anyone have problems upgrading today?
[neutral]	[06:24]	<pawbie>	samliu: And a pentium 133...
[negative]	[06:24]	<Shadow_X>	other than the server being slow
[neutral]	[06:24]	<samliu>	lol
[neutral]	[06:24]	<samliu>	good point
[neutral]	[06:25]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: oh... its one of those blasted draft-n cards...
[negative]	[06:25]	<LoLeN>	pawbie: how do i check them?
[negative]	[06:25]	<Kurtis->	I just tried blacklisting ssb and b43. I'll try ndiswrapper by itself now
[negative]	[06:25]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: Okay. Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 01)
[negative]	[06:25]	<Geoffrey2>	I downloaded the ISO for Hardy Heron and burned it to a CD...now, can that be used to upgrade Ubuntu Gutsy, or can I only do a full install with that...
[negative]	[06:25]	<unop>	LoLeN, perhaps ndiswrapper isn't being loaded at boot .. make sure you have an entry for it in /etc/modules
[negative]	[06:25]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: let me look it up.
[positive]	[06:25]	<samliu>	I have a quadro fx1400go :D
[positive]	[06:25]	<LoLeN>	k ;)
[neutral]	[06:25]	<pawbie>	LoLeN: System -> Administration -> Restricted Modules (I think)
[positive]	[06:25]	<FastZ>	unop: maybe it was...i'm not sure.  I havent done a fresh install on my server machine since dapper and it's been a LAMP server ever since.
[neutral]	[06:25]	<nickrud>	^V^ did you get the question about showing me the output of   sudo fdisk -l ?
[negative]	[06:25]	<pawbie>	I haven't used Ubuntu in a year...
[neutral]	[06:25]	<gogeta>	pawbie did you say p133
[neutral]	[06:25]	<amirman84>	mattycoze: i've gotten a similar thing before, i just ignored it like it was no big deal
[positive]	[06:25]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: it usually worked well previously in 7.10. i haven't tried it yet in 8.04
[positive]	[06:25]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I never had this problem before.  Before I updated to Hardy, video works, graphics worked, no lines or anything.  I have trouble believing this is a hardware issue.  Furthermore, prior to using envy, compiz and videos worked fine.
[positive]	[06:25]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i was, but it was because i had broken packages installed (in my case, a few language packs). i removed the offending packages, and i'm upgrading now :)
[positive]	[06:25]	<bullgard4>	"mc shows an entry prefixed with an exclamation mark (!). I found that this means a ""stale symlink"". What is a 'stale symlink'?"
[positive]	[06:25]	<pawbie>	gogeta: Ya!  I still have one.
[neutral]	[06:25]	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, nice, you goin from 7.10?
[negative]	[06:25]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, is there anyway I can just get rid of envy, and have Ubuntu install the driver it was originally using?
[neutral]	[06:25]	<^V^>	nickrud: @HLINK
[negative]	[06:25]	<amirman84>	mattycoze: keep in mind i'm a total noob but my system is running extremely stable so far
[negative]	[06:25]	<gogeta>	pawbie oh cant run ubuntu on that well if it has 64mb of ram i guess better with puppy or dsl
[negative]	[06:25]	<nickrud>	bullgard4 a broken one? try looking at it with ls --color , if it's red it's broken
[neutral]	[06:26]	<pawbie>	gogeta: debian
[neutral]	[06:26]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: My ifconfig, iwconfig, lshw -C network, lspci, and lsmod are here, if that helps: @HLINK
[positive]	[06:26]	<gogeta>	pawbie yea but it will be slow
[negative]	[06:26]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, yeah. solely because i wanna update libconfuse so i can install awesome wm (i can't install the lib from source for some reason)
[neutral]	[06:26]	<jeffimperia1>	newbie finally got it... woohoo!
[neutral]	[06:26]	<hellmitre>	heya kids
[negative]	[06:26]	<tannewt>	hi all, how do I add a script to run oon suspend and resume?
[neutral]	[06:26]	<pawbie>	gogeta: Not really.  Debian + AMP + VNC + XFCE4...  happy.
[negative]	[06:26]	<unop>	FastZ, looks like even dapper had it - @HLINK
[negative]	[06:26]	<kindofabuzz>	I haven't tried this yet, but those of you that had Broadcom working in Gutsy and now broke in Hardy, and don't have access to a ethernet cable, try this: @HLINK  found in forums, may try it tomorrow
[neutral]	[06:26]	<hellmitre>	wondering how to run network manager
[negative]	[06:26]	<ceil420>	when i get a new computer, i'm putting Debian Stable on this one and making it a server, anyway. but in the meantime, i'm still using Xubuntu
[negative]	[06:26]	<ripps>	AndrianStrays: Use the envyng to remove your drivers and revert them to the radeon drivers
[positive]	[06:26]	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, heh i'm upgrading for several reasons. but of course, they always say its the best version ever. then again, any developer says that :P
[neutral]	[06:27]	<FastZ>	unop: if i remember correctly, you had the option at initial installation to install the LAMP server...or a regular server
[negative]	[06:27]	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: Well other people are saying that b43 should be used
[neutral]	[06:27]	<nick_>	hello
[neutral]	[06:27]	<harriseldon>	hellmitre: nm-applet
[positive]	[06:27]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, lol, gotta try and get their product out there :p
[negative]	[06:27]	<hellmitre>	that's the applet, yeah, but whenever I run that, I get nothing
[neutral]	[06:27]	<Kurtis->	oh, lovely
[neutral]	[06:27]	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: you can't get the b43 if you don't have internet access
[positive]	[06:27]	<FastZ>	unop: regular server being one without the AMP part of the LAMP install
[neutral]	[06:27]	<nick_>	Ubutu 7,1 is cooll
[negative]	[06:27]	<hellmitre>	nothing goes into the panel
[negative]	[06:27]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: your card isn't supported by b43 yet. I'd say stick with ndiswrapper for awhile longer until they release support. Keep looking every few months though. Ndiswrapper is a sub-optimal solution
[positive]	[06:27]	<unop>	FastZ, well, if you install and use tasksell , you have the option on any ubuntu/debian machine :)
[positive]	[06:27]	<KyleK>	ceil420: im running ubuntu on my server :) but its just personal server
[neutral]	[06:27]	<nick_>	where can i start learning more about ubunut
[neutral]	[06:27]	<james_>	 anyone here got a kworld atsc 110?
[negative]	[06:27]	<Kurtis->	FATAL: Could not open /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/modules.dep.temp for writing: Permission denied
[negative]	[06:27]	<nick_>	i just got it
[negative]	[06:27]	<nickrud>	^V^ my suspicion is that the there's a difference between the contents of /boot on the root partition, and the contents of the /boot partition. Try looking at menu.lst with /boot mounted, and without
[neutral]	[06:27]	<unop>	FastZ, s/tasksell/tasksel/
[positive]	[06:27]	<Shadow_X>	"ceil420, yea. and i LOVE the way they are selling this one ""all OS's come with things you'll never use. ubuntu 8.04 comes with an uninstall feature"" LOL"
[negative]	[06:27]	<allyunion>	I have a weird problem with my Toshiba U200 laptop, if I mute the sound in Windows, reboot and enter into Ubuntu, the sound doesn't work (even though I have everything set max for all controls)
[negative]	[06:27]	<Johnny_>	hi i am having a problem and need some help
[negative]	[06:28]	<ceil420>	FastZ, a LAMP server is more or less 'regular'. i don't know why it'd be without the 'A' part, seeing as Apache rocks (and is probably the most ubiquitous server software out there)
[positive]	[06:28]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: i see. well its not critical, cos i have no wifi at the moment so.. i'll do that =)
[neutral]	[06:28]	<Kurtis->	got that when I issued modprobe ndiswrapper && depmod -a
[negative]	[06:28]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I hit uninstall ATI driver in the EnvyNG gui, but how do I reinstall the original raedon drivers?
[negative]	[06:28]	<Kurtis->	as root
[negative]	[06:28]	<Johnny_>	can someone please help me
[neutral]	[06:28]	<samliu>	allyunion, you need audio drivers
[positive]	[06:28]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: thanks for confirming for me =)
[positive]	[06:28]	<ceil420>	lol Shadow_X; that's awesome XD
[negative]	[06:28]	<harriseldon>	hellmitre do you get console output? can you check if the process is already running?
[neutral]	[06:28]	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: I have b43 working already. It comes with the disc.
[neutral]	[06:28]	<pawbie>	ceil420: tomcat!
[neutral]	[06:28]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: no problem
[negative]	[06:28]	<LainIwakura>	not working, but I mean it's installed
[negative]	[06:28]	<mikebot>	Why is it that when I tried to install from the alterate CD, it seems like the upgrader is still fetching files from this internet?
[neutral]	[06:28]	<allyunion>	samliu: I have snd-hda-intel installed
[negative]	[06:28]	<hellmitre>	it does nothing. absolutely blank console when I run it in terminal, harriseldon
[negative]	[06:28]	<samliu>	hmm
[negative]	[06:28]	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: well i sure wish you'd write a guide, i'm sure thousands would aprreciate it
[positive]	[06:28]	<ceil420>	KyleK, mine's personal as well; file server, web site host (perhaps two sites in the future), IRC bot, mebbe a coupla other things
[negative]	[06:28]	<Kurtis->	well, got no error that time, but it's still not working
[positive]	[06:29]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: your chipset is supported by b43. Not b43-legacy. b43
[negative]	[06:29]	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: -_- ill give your method a try
[positive]	[06:29]	<pawbie>	ceil420: squid is a must.
[negative]	[06:29]	<FastZ>	ceil420: nowadays sure, but before, you had to install all the components of a LAMP server on your own, then came the LAMP server installer option...
[positive]	[06:29]	<allyunion>	samliu: And when I do have the audio set to max in Windows, and reboot, the audio works fine in Ubuntu
[neutral]	[06:29]	<ceil420>	pawbie, squid?
[positive]	[06:29]	<harriseldon>	nick_ @HLINK has some screecasts which may help
[positive]	[06:29]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work
[negative]	[06:29]	<Johnny_>	what do i do
[positive]	[06:29]	<pawbie>	ceil420: squid proxy.  Check it out.
[neutral]	[06:29]	<Shadow_X>	w00t i'm upgrading!!!
[negative]	[06:29]	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: well how did you get your's working?
[negative]	[06:29]	<cob>	Lainlwakura: looks like ndiswrapper is loaded in kernel, did you upgrade to hardy or fresh install?
[negative]	[06:29]	<Shadow_X>	im nervous though. last time i upgraded my server....it failed to boot again >.>
[neutral]	[06:29]	<talcite>	LainIwakura, eugenebythesea: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:29]	<Johnny_>	some1 help me
[neutral]	[06:29]	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: no it's not
[neutral]	[06:29]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: cheers
[positive]	[06:29]	<bullgard4>	nickrud: Yes, it shows the pathname and filename red with a black background.
[negative]	[06:29]	<kindofabuzz>	oh thought you said it was
[positive]	[06:29]	<ceil420>	FastZ, i still don't have MySQL or PHP installed :x i need to find a use for a database so i can learn MySQL. Of course, the 'P' in LAMP for me means Perl ;)
[negative]	[06:29]	<Shadow_X>	Johnny_, whats up?
[negative]	[06:29]	<ripps>	AdrianStrays: just a sec
[positive]	[06:29]	<pawbie>	Shadow_X: If everything went right the first time, it wouldn't be near as interesting.
[negative]	[06:29]	<james_>	Shadow_X, too bad you can't remove somethings
[negative]	[06:29]	<talcite>	granted, the updates on that site will be a few months newer than the ones in the repo
[positive]	[06:29]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
[negative]	[06:29]	<nickrud>	bullgard4 so for mc, stale link means broken link
[neutral]	[06:30]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: am i not using b43?
[negative]	[06:30]	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: Were you the one also using bcm4311?
[neutral]	[06:30]	<LainIwakura>	Kurtis- yes
[neutral]	[06:30]	<pawbie>	ceil420: Insert, select, drop, delete, optimize.  You know sql now.
[positive]	[06:30]	<bullgard4>	nickrud: Thank you very much for explaining.
[negative]	[06:30]	<Kurtis->	I'm using revision 2
[negative]	[06:30]	<harriseldon>	hellmitre what about output from nm-tool?
[negative]	[06:30]	<ceil420>	pawbie, i'll hopefully remember that after i upgrade; while upgrading i only wanna run xchat and conky (so no terminal or firefox)
[neutral]	[06:30]	<allyunion>	pawbie: LOL
[negative]	[06:30]	<mikebot>	How do I use the alternate CD?
[neutral]	[06:30]	<ripps>	AdrianStrays: Try sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-driver-radeon
[neutral]	[06:30]	<ceil420>	pawbie, lol
[negative]	[06:30]	<jim_beam>	does anyone know if i deed to re-install ati drivers after 7.10 to 8.04 upgrade
[neutral]	[06:30]	<Kurtis->	that says that it needs a patch for kernel 2.6.24
[negative]	[06:30]	<Kurtis->	what sort of a patch?
[negative]	[06:30]	<amirman84>	is there any way to transfer my wubi install to a real one?
[negative]	[06:30]	<nickrud>	bullgard4 haven't used mc for a while, nice piece of software, no?
[negative]	[06:30]	<Shadow_X>	i think my server issue was from lack of knowledge of linux. im sure i couldve fixed it had I tried
[neutral]	[06:30]	<pawbie>	amirman84: dd
[positive]	[06:30]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
[neutral]	[06:30]	<amirman84>	pawbie: dd?
[neutral]	[06:31]	<hellmitre>	harriseldon: says I'm connected via eth0 (wired)
[neutral]	[06:31]	<kindofabuzz>	they shouldn't have relesedhardy until wireless worked for all.  especially if it worked in gutsy and now it doesn't
[neutral]	[06:31]	<pawbie>	amirman84: man dd
[negative]	[06:31]	<cob>	Johnny_: how long did you wait?
[negative]	[06:31]	<amirman84>	oh ok
[neutral]	[06:31]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, it was unable to lock the admin directory
[positive]	[06:31]	<mattycoze>	amirman84 aha! success, it installed nicely
[neutral]	[06:31]	<mattycoze>	amirman84 and happens to be working
[neutral]	[06:31]	<Johnny_>	cob awhile
[negative]	[06:31]	<pawbie>	kindofabuzz: 2 words.  Screw Broadcom
[negative]	[06:31]	<Johnny_>	over 10 mins
[negative]	[06:31]	<nickrud>	jim_beam 8.04 has the latest driver from ati already, no need to install the one from the website
[positive]	[06:31]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i just set up my apache server a long time ago with some basic options and never touched it again :p it just starts up with my computer
[negative]	[06:31]	<Kurtis->	Still can't get my chip to work
[negative]	[06:31]	<Shadow_X>	jim_beam, i would think not. although im not sure. i expect the upgrade tool would handle packages with no problem. however, if you have problems with X afterwards, I would advise you to reinstall them then
[neutral]	[06:31]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, nevermind
[neutral]	[06:31]	<amirman84>	mattycoze: awesome, i'm glad you were saved of the headaches i went through
[neutral]	[06:31]	<kindofabuzz>	pawbie: well i like Linksys
[neutral]	[06:31]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: I have b43-fwcutter installed already
[negative]	[06:31]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: I thought you said you were using ndiswrapper?
[negative]	[06:31]	<pawbie>	kindofabuzz: Screw linksys, too.  Atheros ftw.
[positive]	[06:31]	<jim_beam>	thanks
[neutral]	[06:31]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: no i wasn't
[neutral]	[06:31]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: and have you loaded fw onto the card?
[negative]	[06:32]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, okay I did that.  Restart?
[positive]	[06:32]	<bullgard4>	nickrud: I like mc very much. Particularly for its clear arrangement and small footprint.
[negative]	[06:32]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: How do I do that?
[neutral]	[06:32]	<adil>	kk
[neutral]	[06:32]	<kindofabuzz>	pawbie: never heard of Atheros
[neutral]	[06:32]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:32]	<Johnny_>	can some1 help me please
[positive]	[06:32]	<nickrud>	bullgard4 yes, and it's great for looking inside deb packages when your gui is broken ;)
[positive]	[06:32]	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, yea, i was running ubuntu for the server. its an apache and file server. i tried upgrading, and it failed to boot so idk. im nervous about this upgrade :P
[negative]	[06:32]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: the nice thing about wireless is that its more or less the same across the distros
[positive]	[06:32]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
[neutral]	[06:32]	<pawbie>	kindofabuzz: Google ubiquiti wireless.  Best cards ever.
[neutral]	[06:32]	<Kurtis->	talcite: know what it means about the patch needed for 2.6.24?
[positive]	[06:32]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do

[negative]	[06:32]	<FloodBot2>	Johnny_: Please don't flood, use @HLINK to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[negative]	[06:32]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: you can probably take that info as-is
[negative]	[06:32]	<samliu>	usually when I upgrade I completely remove my lamp and reinstall it
[neutral]	[06:33]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: let me look into it
[neutral]	[06:33]	<Johnny_>	srry
[neutral]	[06:33]	<samliu>	cause its not really a hassle
[neutral]	[06:33]	<Johnny_>	can some1 please help m

[neutral]	[06:33]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, restart?
[negative]	[06:33]	<harriseldon>	hellmitre then at least network manager itself is working, just not the applet
[neutral]	[06:33]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: I'm a little confused but I will give that link a try.. thanks
[negative]	[06:33]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ no one is sure, have you run the disk check on the startup menu
[neutral]	[06:33]	<XceII>	try a reburn Johnny_
[negative]	[06:33]	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: Which revision are you using of that chipset?
[neutral]	[06:33]	<bullgard4>	nickrud: May God give that my GUI does not break.
[negative]	[06:33]	<amirman84>	pawbie: i kind of frigured i would be copying files over but which folders do i need and which folders should i totally NOT copy?
[negative]	[06:33]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i'm kinda nervous because i haven't backed anything up; i'm hoping i won't have any problems :x
[negative]	[06:33]	<LainIwakura>	kurtis- rev 1

[neutral]	[06:33]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ reboot, and run the diskcheck
[neutral]	[06:33]	<Johnny_>	what is the alt disk
[negative]	[06:33]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Ah, no, just use dd.  Boot the wubi install, prepare a partition on a physical disk, then dd if=wubipartition of=mynewpartition and walk away for a while.
[neutral]	[06:33]	<Shadow_X>	lol im already having problems. the upgrader complains about unsupported packages and stops >.>
[positive]	[06:33]	<mikebot>	Is #ubuntu-offtopic a channel for ONLY off-topic discussion, or it allows off-topic discussion?

[negative]	[06:34]	<hellmitre>	ah!
[negative]	[06:34]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: sorry, what did you mean by kernel patches? you shouldn't need to install any others
[neutral]	[06:34]	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: well i'm on gutsy now
[neutral]	[06:34]	<hellmitre>	fixed it, harriseldon
[positive]	[06:34]	<hellmitre>	thanks!
[negative]	[06:34]	<pawbie>	amirman84: you could also using something like g4u or whatever the other Ghost4Linux package is.  Or you could even use ghost.
[negative]	[06:34]	<nickrud>	^V^ it? you mean, the /boot partition?
[neutral]	[06:34]	<^V^>	yes
[negative]	[06:34]	<bcgrown>	anybody know how I can make my geforce fx 5500 show the entire screen on tv-out instead of just the top left corner?  I am using nvidia-glx-new drivers and twinview
[neutral]	[06:34]	<Kurtis->	talcite: I was the one who mentioned kernel patches
[positive]	[06:34]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
[negative]	[06:34]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: i don't recall mentioning that... ?
[neutral]	[06:34]	<^V^>	nickrud: the boot partition has not been updated
[neutral]	[06:34]	<Pradalvr>	I have two separate hard drives..one for windows and the other for Ubuntu
[neutral]	[06:34]	<amirman84>	pawbie: i'm really confused
[neutral]	[06:34]	<Shadow_X>	anyone know how to upgrade from the alternate cd?
[positive]	[06:34]	<seamus7>	Pradalvr when you install Ubuntu it offers to set up your partitions ... you could also use GParted from the Live CD (I think it's on there)
[negative]	[06:34]	<ricree>	can anyone help me with a keyboard problem?  My num lock no longer seems to work after the upgrade
[negative]	[06:35]	<Kurtis->	"talcite: ""# bcm4311 rev 2 / bcm4312 (needs patches for 2.6.24) """
[negative]	[06:35]	<supersako>	is it still better to use envy or is the ubuntu restricted drivers better now??
[neutral]	[06:35]	<talcite>	kindofabuzz: you probably have unsatisfied dependencies.
[positive]	[06:35]	<wayne_>	woooo I love Hardy!!!!
[neutral]	[06:35]	<jim_beam>	is there a link for64bit kernel
[positive]	[06:35]	<supersako>	i love Hardy more!
[positive]	[06:35]	<Johnny_>	I am trying to install ubuntu and am able to boot up the installation DVD and when it asks for the language I hit enter on english and it works but now whenever i hit enter on install or try or anything else it doesnt work what do i do
[negative]	[06:35]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Hm.  You have a wubi install, and want to put it on a physical disk, yes?

[positive]	[06:35]	<nick_>	Can anyone sugeest a good media player for ubuntu for all my music and that
[positive]	[06:35]	<ricree>	although the keyboard light turns on when I do hit the numlock key
[neutral]	[06:35]	<DShepherd>	supersako, no need for envy
[positive]	[06:35]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, that sounds about like what i had. check the /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log (i think that's the one) and see which packages are failing. i only had four files in that folder (and one of them was blank), so it won't take too long to go through them all :p
[negative]	[06:35]	<gogeta>	supersako envy = bad
[neutral]	[06:35]	<Shadow_X>	nick you can try songbird
[negative]	[06:35]	<amirman84>	pawbie: the wubi install i'm using resides in the partition that i want to copy it to
[neutral]	[06:35]	<supersako>	cool
[negative]	[06:35]	<pawbie>	Johnny_: Try hitting space, or click, or tab.  Or download and burn again.
[negative]	[06:35]	<PFC_Tabasco>	supersako: I got nvidia_glx_new to work without a lot of trouble, but sadly it wasn't nearly as easy as 7.10
[neutral]	[06:35]	<seamus7>	nick_ Amarok
[negative]	[06:35]	<kindofabuzz>	talcite: but i can't satisfy those dependancies cause not online
[negative]	[06:35]	<eugenebythesea>	hi - for hardy, should i use ndiswrapper version 1.9? i want to know if that is the latest one
[negative]	[06:35]	<wayne_>	while 1 { me.truelove(Hardy); }
[positive]	[06:35]	<ricree>	nick_: I prefer rhythmbox, others like amarok
[negative]	[06:35]	<amirman84>	pawbie: yeah, that's it
[neutral]	[06:35]	<Johnny_>	i burned twice
[negative]	[06:35]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Oh.  Good luck.  You can dd to a network location and then restore from there?
[negative]	[06:35]	<supersako>	Tabasco what do u have to do?
[negative]	[06:35]	<nickrud>	^V^ ok,  Me, I'd mount it at /mnt and simply copy over all the stuff in boot on the root to the /boot partition
[negative]	[06:35]	<nick_>	how do i get amarok
[negative]	[06:36]	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, does ndiswrapper not have a website to tell you the latest version?
[negative]	[06:36]	<LainIwakura>	same.. i can't get online to apt-get
[negative]	[06:36]	<Pradalvr>	seamus7 I'm there and don't know how to use it
[neutral]	[06:36]	<gogeta>	Johnny_: md5 iso make shure its not bad
[neutral]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	nick_: apt-get install amarok ?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<ricree>	nick_: synaptic or apt-get
[positive]	[06:36]	<supersako>	amirman hehe i knew an amir from los angeles that was born in 84 :p
[neutral]	[06:36]	<Baxtor>	Hey guys, ive just received an IDE HDD from a friend (crappy 20gig one) so i can load some stuff on there for him, how does one change the owner of the drive so i can delete the items currently on there and reformat it into a diffrent file system using ubuntu?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	nick_: Try exaile
[neutral]	[06:36]	<ceil420>	nick_, ewwww KDE. but yeah, apt-get works
[negative]	[06:36]	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420> i don't know
[negative]	[06:36]	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: did you try that method i posted?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<Johnny_>	what is md5 iso
[neutral]	[06:36]	<nick_>	so whats the best
[negative]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	Baxtor: Just reformat it.  No need to do the other steps.
[neutral]	[06:36]	<amirman84>	pawbie: so is dd or ghost basically creating an image of my disk?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<nick_>	haha
[positive]	[06:36]	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, google is your friend :)
[neutral]	[06:36]	<gogeta>	Baxtor just format it
[neutral]	[06:36]	<nickrud>	!md5sum | Johnny_
[positive]	[06:36]	<ubotu>	Johnny_: To verify the integrity of a download, use the md5sum - see @HLINK for more
[neutral]	[06:36]	<mikebot>	Can someone help me with te alternate CD?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<cupajoe>	Bueller? Bueller? Anyone?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<nickrud>	!who | Johnny_
[positive]	[06:36]	<ubotu>	Johnny_: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[negative]	[06:36]	<Kurtis->	I prefer KDE myself and am actually using Kubuntu, but my problem isn't Kubuntu-specific.
[negative]	[06:36]	<PFC_Tabasco>	supersako: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment your restricted repos, apt-get update and then go the the Hardware Drivers option in System->Administration
[positive]	[06:36]	<Shadow_X>	Baxtor, i believe using GParted would solve those issues
[neutral]	[06:36]	<Baxtor>	can you just use Gparted?
[negative]	[06:36]	<seamus7>	Pradalvr: are you dual booting with Windows or installing Ubuntu on a maching by itself?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	"amirman84: Ya.  The trick with the wubi bit, though, is that you need to boot wubi to ""see"" your wubi install."
[positive]	[06:36]	<amirman84>	supersako: i was born in 84 but in Iran
[negative]	[06:36]	<gogeta>	Baxtor yep
[negative]	[06:36]	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420> hm. i could find out about that - but what i really want to know - if .. is that version suitable for hardy?
[neutral]	[06:36]	<Baxtor>	cheers
[neutral]	[06:37]	<talcite>	kindofabuzz: I see. I doubt we'll get a .deb for it soon though. I don't think there's anything you can do in the mean time
[neutral]	[06:37]	<Johnny_>	thanx for the afvice
[negative]	[06:37]	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, hmm. try apt-cache showpkg ndiswrapper <=- i think that's the command to show you Ubuntu's current version of the package
[neutral]	[06:37]	<Johnny_>	srry i am new to irc
[positive]	[06:37]	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420> cool =) thanks for that
[neutral]	[06:37]	<ceil420>	np
[negative]	[06:37]	<Johnny_>	pawbie: i am not sure what ti di
[negative]	[06:37]	<LainIwakura>	kindofabuzz: i'm not sure how to configure ndiswrapper though. i had no problem with fwcutter in gutsy
[neutral]	[06:37]	<dystopianray>	what version of fglrx does hardy have?
[negative]	[06:37]	<kindofabuzz>	talcite: i think i tried to make a deb from gutsy but i don't think it worked
[negative]	[06:37]	<talcite>	Kurtis-: I'm not sure which patch its referring to. We're on a pretty recent version of 2.6.24. Have you tried b43 with the firmware?
[positive]	[06:38]	<gogeta>	dystopianray i dunno ask google :P
[negative]	[06:38]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ no problem If I may, I'd suggest you use   xchat   for irc, works better out of the box than pidgin does
[negative]	[06:38]	<Baxtor>	ahh... unmount the drive so you can re-format it.. silly baxtor *duh*
[neutral]	[06:38]	<Kurtis->	I downloaded the b43-fwcutter package
[negative]	[06:38]	<amirman84>	pawbie: when i was looking at where wubi is installed from windows i noticed that there are quite a few ISO's it seems like i should be able to install ubuntu brand new on the partition and restore my system from those ISOs... is that possible?
[negative]	[06:38]	<Kurtis->	and that didn't work
[negative]	[06:38]	<Kurtis->	I'll try compiling it myself, I guess
[positive]	[06:38]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: Ndiswrapper's latest version is 1.52 as of a few weeks ago

[negative]	[06:40]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I did what you said, and videos work now.  However, the resolution is screwed up and compiz was off.  Restarted compiz and was prompt to install ATI Accelerated Drivers, I'm going to restart now and see if the resolution is better
[negative]	[06:40]	<ezzieyguywuf>	do i need to install xgl-xserver in order for compiz to work?
[negative]	[06:40]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ you need to be more specific. What is anything?

[positive]	[06:40]	<Armored_Azrae1>	Hey, does anyone know how to get evolution to use kerberos tokens?
[negative]	[06:40]	<Shadow_X>	nick_ its in the design of linux itself. its Unix based. so its built securely from the ground up. its a difficult thing to explain unless you have a solid foundation in computer/network security
[negative]	[06:40]	<samliu>	if it isn't the bad iso, I think it might have to do with either ram or if its an old computer
[positive]	[06:40]	<^V^>	nickrud: thanks

[negative]	[06:42]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: how is the firmware loading coming?
[negative]	[06:42]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, yeah.. really....
[neutral]	[06:42]	<mlw1>	can anyone tell me why my xorg changes don't go through?  I select 1920x1200 as my resolution in nvidia-settings, it works fine, I save it to xorg, that works, then I reboot, and the changes are gone
[negative]	[06:43]	<nick_>	wish i could program so i could help make stuff
[negative]	[06:43]	<kindofabuzz>	LainIwakura: i was thinking you may have to uncooment the b43xxx also
[negative]	[06:43]	<SecretGirl>	zero, where do i type that
[neutral]	[06:43]	<Koheleth>	anyreason why Konversation takes a while to start in Hardy Heron?
[neutral]	[06:43]	<zero>	ceil420, its in a window on all my computers
[neutral]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	nick_: Unix isn't open source
[negative]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	Linux is a clone of it
[negative]	[06:43]	<ezzieyguywuf>	"I'm getting that 'no composite extension available"" error, which in the past was solved with xgl, but i think the other day someone said something about heron not needing it?"
[negative]	[06:43]	<samliu>	oh right
[negative]	[06:43]	<pawbie>	"mlw1: When I use the nvidia app, it doesn't actually write over xorg.conf....   Try hitting ""Show Preview"" and cut and pasting that into a new xorg.conf"
[neutral]	[06:43]	<zero>	SecretGirl, its in the boot options of the CD to type that, hit f5 when you boot into the CD
[neutral]	[06:43]	<samliu>	mikebot
[neutral]	[06:43]	<kindofabuzz>	so you'd blacklist the two things but un blacklist bcm43xx
[neutral]	[06:43]	<mikebot>	samliu: Yes.
[negative]	[06:43]	<samliu>	ah
[neutral]	[06:43]	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, many Unices are open source; OpenSolaris, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc
[negative]	[06:43]	<samliu>	thats why
[neutral]	[06:43]	<samliu>	the alt CD doesnt have the live bootup
[negative]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	Well, yeah
[negative]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	But THE Unix isn't
[negative]	[06:44]	<mikebot>	samliu: I'm sorry?
[neutral]	[06:44]	<pawbie>	samliu: No GUI.
[negative]	[06:44]	<ceil420>	zero, weird :o i've never even seen it have a window of it's own. look at the .conkyrc's they have on the conky home page and see how they have theirs set up
[neutral]	[06:44]	<samliu>	right
[positive]	[06:44]	<red_>	hi..got a problem with my internet speed. downloading and web browsing is very slow. usually my speed is 20kbps now its 6kpbs sometimes below than that. any help pls...
[negative]	[06:44]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: no idea how to do it.. i'm really a novice
[positive]	[06:44]	<samliu>	so it can install in situations the normal disk may come across issues
[negative]	[06:44]	<samliu>	which is a good reason why Johnny_ should try it
[neutral]	[06:44]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: have you compiled a binary from source before?
[negative]	[06:44]	<samliu>	unless people have better suggestions lol
[positive]	[06:44]	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, Bell Labs' UNIX(R) isn't, no :p
[negative]	[06:44]	<Johnny_>	ok does anyone have any advise
[neutral]	[06:44]	<usser>	nick_, i'd say different heritage, most unixes go way back whereas linux is a pretty recent thing
[neutral]	[06:44]	<pawbie>	talcite: What are binary?
[neutral]	[06:44]	<Johnny_>	that i will know how to do
[neutral]	[06:45]	<zero>	ceil420, what?
[negative]	[06:45]	<SecretGirl>	zero, f5 is for accessibility options, is that the one
[negative]	[06:45]	<pawbie>	Johnny_: samliu mentions trying the alt CD.  Did you try that?
[positive]	[06:45]	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, and actually, i think their original Unix was open source. they went closed source later on (maybe as late as System V)
[neutral]	[06:45]	<kindofabuzz>	linux is only 10 years old
[neutral]	[06:45]	<mikebot>	Can someone hep me with upgrading from the alt CD?
[negative]	[06:45]	<Kurtis->	hmm
[negative]	[06:45]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: i know how to type ./configure and make. does that count?
[negative]	[06:45]	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: i'm running hardy heron and I have an ATI V5200 video card
[negative]	[06:45]	<Johnny_>	pawbie: binary is the language that the computer naturally understands it is made of 1 and 0s
[negative]	[06:45]	<Seveas>	ceil420, nope, Bell Labs' Unix was always closed iirc
[positive]	[06:45]	<samliu>	!tab Johnny_ pawbie provided the link earlier

[positive]	[06:45]	<pawbie>	Johnny_: Hey!  Good job.
[positive]	[06:45]	<harriseldon>	kindofabuzz 1991 was only 10 years ago?
[neutral]	[06:45]	<samliu>	er
[negative]	[06:45]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: please don't forget which changes you make by the way. You'll have to undo them to test other methods.
[neutral]	[06:45]	<samliu>	lol
[negative]	[06:45]	<eugenebythesea>	ceil420, talcite: the latest ndiswrapper in the repos is 1.50 - so i'll just go with that. blacklisting b43 and getting my driver now
[negative]	[06:45]	<SecretGirl>	zero, f5 is for accessibility options, is that the one
[negative]	[06:45]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: that's all you need
[neutral]	[06:45]	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: have you installed build-essential?
[positive]	[06:45]	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: both fglrx and the open source drivers support aiglx now
[neutral]	[06:45]	<ceil420>	zero, there are example .conkyrc files at @HLINK - base your conkyrc on one of them and modify as necessary

[positive]	[06:45]	<Johnny_>	pawbie: good job about what
[negative]	[06:45]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: alright.. i'm going to give ndiswrapper a try first
[neutral]	[06:45]	<pawbie>	"Johnny_: @HLINK  Go there, find the link that says ""alternative"" for 8.04, and try that one."
[negative]	[06:45]	<samliu>	xepra whats the problem
[neutral]	[06:45]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: go ahead. 1.50 is fine
[negative]	[06:45]	<Seveas>	Johnny_, watch out, I patented the 1!
[neutral]	[06:45]	<zero>	SecretGirl, its one of the f keys i cant remember exactly wich one

[negative]	[06:46]	<Johnny_>	there is no md5check for the mac
[negative]	[06:46]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, alright, everything appears to be in working order, and also, it seems like that line issue I was talking about was mysteriously resolved in the process.  What was that command you told me to use to get the driver?
[negative]	[06:46]	<Koheleth>	xepra:  I am not a grub man
[negative]	[06:46]	<samliu>	oh
[neutral]	[06:46]	<samliu>	super grub boot disk
[negative]	[06:46]	<ceil420>	Seveas, maybe i was tired at the time and i'm thinking of something different, but i was recently reading about the history of Unix, and i think the earliest versions were open. That might have been before Bell took on the project, though
[neutral]	[06:46]	<xepra>	unfortunate
[negative]	[06:46]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ ok, another link: @HLINK has exact instructions for the mac. First thing, check to make sure you have a good download
[neutral]	[06:46]	<Koheleth>	try googling it
[positive]	[06:46]	<dystopianray>	kindofabuzz: linux was first released in 1991
[positive]	[06:46]	<samliu>	it has an auto fix for that situation
[negative]	[06:46]	<kindofabuzz>	MrObvious: how did you even get it to work? lol
[positive]	[06:46]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: you'll probably have less chance of having ndiswrapper work. It has several bugs regarding WPA authentication
[neutral]	[06:46]	<pawbie>	xepra: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:46]	<samliu>	hold on

[neutral]	[06:47]	<talcite>	pawbie: a binary is a program
[positive]	[06:47]	<samliu>	please have a look :D
[negative]	[06:47]	<xepra>	is there a way to remove grub from mbr completely?

[negative]	[06:48]	<MrObvious>	kindofabuzz: What do you mean?
[positive]	[06:48]	<amirman84>	so when i drag windows around, they are wobbly and awesome, is the compiz-fusion at work?
[negative]	[06:48]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: Because I already have b43-fwcutter installed
[negative]	[06:48]	<pawbie>	talcite: Fail. :\
[neutral]	[06:48]	<samliu>	download the disk, boot up, follow the screens

[positive]	[06:48]	<samliu>	its pretty straightforward
[neutral]	[06:48]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ the path is the file folder structure.
[neutral]	[06:48]	<samliu>	it'll rewrite your mbr and grub stuff

[negative]	[06:48]	<Johnny_>	nickrud: what does that mean

[neutral]	[06:48]	<mikebot>	samliu: Is that to me?
[negative]	[06:48]	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: I can't tell. In gutsy, I was prompted on my first boot up to install restricted drivers, but for Hardy I was not asked that, nor could I find the option in System>>administration. How can i check which driver I am using?
[neutral]	[06:48]	<Johnny_>	nickrud: can we private chat
[positive]	[06:48]	<harriseldon>	kindofabuzz there is a good documentary called revolution os about linux history. it covers the 1999 time frame, but very good
[negative]	[06:48]	<kindofabuzz>	MrObvious: most people can't even get b43cutter working at all, at least your is working
[negative]	[06:48]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: no idea. I don't know what hardy installs by default. I would make sure you have the firmware installed just to be sure
[positive]	[06:48]	<gnuskoo1>	my ubuntu hardy is slower than my xp install, what gives?How do i make sure my intel graphics card is running optimum, it's way too sluggish at the mo?
[neutral]	[06:48]	<Johnny_>	nickrud: to get rid of this clutter
[neutral]	[06:48]	<samliu>	no its to xepra sorry mikebot

[neutral]	[06:49]	<pawbie>	yay, Grub error 21 again.
[neutral]	[06:49]	<pawbie>	hm
[negative]	[06:49]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ I've never used a mac, so I can't tell you how the mac's file structure is laid out. But I'm sure there's some info on the mac sites
[negative]	[06:49]	<MrObvious>	kindofabuzz: I don't know. I have the bcm94311 chipset.
[negative]	[06:49]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: it seems to be version specific
[negative]	[06:49]	<mikebot>	nickrud: Do you know about the alt CD installation?
[negative]	[06:49]	<SecretGirl>	f6 is for other options, i wrote what you said and hit enter, now its booting

I'm a generally advanced user though treat me like a basic one because this is my first time using Ubuntu. I am, however, sure that the volume is turned up in the software and not muted. I'm running on a laptop with integrated speakers, I believe it uses Realtek hardware. I don't know how to figure out what driver Ubuntu is using for it
[negative]	[06:50]	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: yea so i'm kinda stuck. I just did a clean install. the other day i upgraded from gutsy, and got compiz to work after installing xgl but it was sluggish and buggy, so i'm trying to find alternatices

[negative]	[06:59]	<harriseldon>	karllenz try using places connect to server -- try it as a windows share. I do not know what mechanism osx uses by default. you may want to find that out first

[positive]	[06:59]	<nickrud>	mikebot alt-f8 will show the install log, you can see for sure what it's doing
[negative]	[06:59]	<orven>	is it normal that packages are showing as 'unauthenticated'?
[negative]	[06:59]	<kindofabuzz>	i wonder if there's anyway to upgrade from the hardy iso?

[negative]	[07:01]	<supersako>	i keep typing in nm-applet nothing happens
[negative]	[07:01]	<mikebot>	nickrud: I mean, I thought that I would be installing from the CD, not downloading from the internet.. alt+f8 is not doing anything.

[neutral]	[07:07]	<nickrud>	^V^ I think @HLINK should work, your drives all being seen as serial devices should remove all the sata/pata pain
[neutral]	[07:07]	<Kurtis->	which is bothersome because he's an absolute n00b to Linux and I've been using it for a few years now
[neutral]	[07:08]	<towlie>	seamus7, i ran update manager hit check and it says its downloading 45 files. once it completes i hit check again and it does the same thing over and over again
[positive]	[07:08]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays now, ask me your question so I can probably say, 'no freaking clue' ;)
[negative]	[07:08]	<jeffimperial>	I am using the cdromupgrade (Alternate CD) because I have very slow Internet Connection (ADSL). wanted to ask if why the method i'm using is still connecting to the internet..

[positive]	[07:08]	<Arelis>	Has the chat calmed down a bit?
[positive]	[07:08]	<nickrud>	jeffimperial because you have installed stuff during gutsy that is still only available over the net
[positive]	[07:08]	<Arelis>	so i can finally ask my question?
[negative]	[07:08]	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, so my issue was originally this.  Whenever I change screens or played videos, these vertical lines appeared all over my screen.  I posted on the ubuntu forums, someone suggested I use EnvyNG.  I did, and that made things worse.  The lines remained, and now I couldn't watch videos, nothing displayed.

[neutral]	[07:09]	<towlie>	seamus7, can i pm you
[neutral]	[07:09]	<Kurtis->	'night to the ones where it's actually night
[neutral]	[07:09]	<Arelis>	Kurtis-: still a busy chat, eh?
[negative]	[07:09]	<seamus7>	towlie: sound like what others have said ... it's just not able to complete the download fully because of the load on servers at the moment ... might need to wait til tomorrow
[neutral]	[07:09]	<Kurtis->	quite
[neutral]	[07:09]	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: any workaround so that Update Manager won't connect to the Internet?

[neutral]	[07:09]	<Liquid-Silence>	hmmm
[negative]	[07:09]	<Liquid-Silence>	I just intalled the nvidia drivers
[negative]	[07:10]	<cellofellow>	this question is NOT ABOUT HARDY: should I set up the rsync daemon to use xinetd like this (@HLINK says, or use a regular UNIX daemon? (I'm trying to get BackupPC working.)
[positive]	[07:10]	<^V^>	nickrud: thanks
[negative]	[07:10]	<Liquid-Silence>	but I cant run dual monitors
[neutral]	[07:10]	<markf>	whu not using a torrent file?
[negative]	[07:10]	<nickrud>	jeffimperial you can try disabling all your sources, except for the cdrom. It probably won't work, since you'd have some broken packages.
[neutral]	[07:10]	<leonbrussels>	SecretGirl: probably a malburnt CD. Try the check cd for defect option in the boot menu
[neutral]	[07:10]	<Arelis>	!party | Everybody, DO NOT IGNORE THIS MESSAGE
[negative]	[07:10]	<ubotu>	Everybody, DO NOT IGNORE THIS MESSAGE: please see above
[negative]	[07:10]	<dsop>	does someone have problems with the framebuffer in hardy?
[neutral]	[07:10]	<h00k>	harriseldon: now I disconnected the drive and got I/O errors again, unable to read partition table.  This isn't cool, I'll see what I can do
[neutral]	[07:10]	<Kurtis->	anyway, bye
[positive]	[07:10]	<nickrud>	^V^ thank me if it works ;)
[neutral]	[07:10]	<zelrikriando>	how to make compiz work again on hardy
[neutral]	[07:10]	<zelrikriando>	?
[negative]	[07:10]	<kimmey>	I was running update-manager to update to hardy. When it update-manager started to remove old packages my power went down. How may I fix this?
[negative]	[07:10]	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, I'm using a Raedon Xpress 1100 card.  I've been having massive amounts of issues since upgrading, and in all honestly, I'm having trouble remembering all the things we've done.
[negative]	[07:10]	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: how 'bout just turning off my modem? would the Upd. Mgr. still continue to work if i just unplug it?
[negative]	[07:10]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Doesn't it work?
[negative]	[07:10]	<Waffle>	Arelis, what message are we not supposed to ignore?
[positive]	[07:11]	<SecretGirl>	CD is fine
[negative]	[07:11]	<Nahi>	can anyone help me in cpanel stuff i recently got a server and im trying to make users for cpanel
[negative]	[07:11]	<dny>	my sound keeps going out, and i have to reboot for it to start again.  is there a way to restart alsa or something? :/
[neutral]	[07:11]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: lots of things got broken when I upgraded
[negative]	[07:11]	<nickrud>	jeffimperial it'll try to download from the net, but get 404's. Then you can depend on breakage
[negative]	[07:11]	<cupajoe>	﻿﻿I have a quick question, I just installed Ubuntu and I can't figure out how to get my sound to work. I'm a generally advanced user though treat me like a basic one because this is my first time using Ubuntu. I am, however, sure that the volume is turned up in the software and not muted. I'm running on a laptop with integrated speakers, I believe it uses Realtek hardware. I don't know how to figure out what driver Ubuntu is using for it
[negative]	[07:11]	<SecretGirl>	leonbrussels, someone recommended booting with  acpi and apm off, i did that and now i'm at a command prompt. what should i do now
[neutral]	[07:11]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: I cant even start the synaptic manager
[neutral]	[07:11]	<pawbie>	argh
[neutral]	[07:11]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: OPen up a terminal and type compiz. Thne give the output
[neutral]	[07:11]	<pawbie>	Grub fragged my stripe set.
[negative]	[07:11]	<xepra>	cupajoe: sometimes the drivers don't work by default, I never could get them to work right in fact
[negative]	[07:11]	<Arelis>	"Waffle: the chat about release partying - because, yesterday, many people were coming in and saying ""Hardy got released!"", so people wouldn't get good support"
[negative]	[07:11]	<h00k>	harriseldon: any ideas off the top of your head?
[negative]	[07:11]	<Shadow_X>	im trying to upgrade to hardy, and even after removing unsupported packages, the upgrade still fails and complains that it can calculate the changes. any ideas?
[neutral]	[07:12]	<harriseldon>	SecretGirl is this a macbook pro?
[negative]	[07:12]	<cupajoe>	Well that's depressing :/
[negative]	[07:12]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays the end of your question got cut off
[neutral]	[07:12]	<leonbrussels>	SecretGril: Try pressing Control+D and it will normally continue booting normally
[negative]	[07:12]	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: oh well... three hourse and 122 files to go then.. thanks anyway
[neutral]	[07:12]	<leonbrussels>	SecretGirl: Try pressing Control+D and it will normally continue booting normally
[neutral]	[07:12]	<Arelis>	Waffle: err, chat = message
[neutral]	[07:12]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:12]	<cupajoe>	Anyone else have thoughts?
[negative]	[07:12]	<mlw1>	hey again, I'm having some big problems connecting to a sftp server in 8.04.  It worked fine and extremely fast on 7.10, but now using connect to server and specifying the same settings gives me errors after about one folder access.  Any ideas?
[negative]	[07:12]	<harriseldon>	h00k I have no idea, it seems like a hardware issue. do you have another computer to test with? even a 7.10 live cd if that worked before
[neutral]	[07:12]	<xepra>	cupajoe:  google around, sometimes you just have to build/install your own
[negative]	[07:12]	<xepra>	which isn't too bad
[positive]	[07:12]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: the synaptic package manager is more important I guess
[positive]	[07:12]	<nickrud>	jeffimperial yeah, the downside of using a net oriented os. I used to update debian unstable over a modem, so I have only a little sympathy ;)
[positive]	[07:12]	<supersako>	do we need to install the simple ccsm now for compiz?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<pawbie>	supersako: Fusion-icon
[neutral]	[07:13]	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, this may be easier: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:13]	<cupajoe>	Well I can install my own but I don't quite have the level of skill needed to build a driver
[positive]	[07:13]	<the_darkside_986>	does Ubuntu Hardy still support single-core 32-bit CPU like Intel Celeron?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<h00k>	harriseldon: I'll try a live CD, I have some other utils I can try.  It /just/ worked today, newer drive, backed up all my info to it before my upgrade
[neutral]	[07:13]	<SecretGirl>	harriseldon, no, a compaq nx9010
[negative]	[07:13]	<Nahi>	i have cpanel installed but i dunno how to use it
[negative]	[07:13]	<supersako>	im reading this thing that says u need to dl a new thing called simple-ccsm
[positive]	[07:13]	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: yes, of course it does
[negative]	[07:13]	<jeffimperial>	nickrud: thanks man.. at least i can stop wondering.. have to leave the effing room so that i could maximize the bandwidth..  laters
[positive]	[07:13]	<harriseldon>	SecretGirl I saw some macbook pro threads with the same error, I will keep checking
[neutral]	[07:13]	<jeanre>	hi all
[negative]	[07:13]	<SecretGirl>	leonbrussels, control+d dush do anything i'm still in the built in shell
[neutral]	[07:14]	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: yes
[neutral]	[07:14]	<jeanre>	"hi all0ModeLine ""1280x800"" 80.58 1280 1344 1480 1680 800 801 804 8270?"
[neutral]	[07:14]	<the_darkside_986>	ok. and i386 is the right iso?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<jeanre>	err
[positive]	[07:14]	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, that is the beginning.  The problem has changed alittle.  Now when I switch off compiz, videos work fine and the lines are gone, when I switch it back on, the lines show up, a bit less, and videos are blinky and have lines all over them.
[neutral]	[07:14]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Is synaptic broken?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: yes
[negative]	[07:14]	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: thats like 90% of all computers, so of course
[negative]	[07:14]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: yeah
[negative]	[07:14]	<jeanre>	is there any reason why I can not run 1280x800 on with nvidia drivers?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<mlw1>	is there a terminal command to change the resolution of a monitor that I could add to my session commands for startup?
[negative]	[07:14]	<Cusoon959>	I blacklisted ssb in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist along with b43. b43 is no longer loading, but ssb is. How do I fix this?
[negative]	[07:14]	<SecretGirl>	does anybody know how to install ubuntu from the shell
[neutral]	[07:14]	<SecretGirl>	step by step
[neutral]	[07:14]	<m8m8y8>	jia hao
[negative]	[07:14]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikirando: What does it say?
[negative]	[07:14]	<Arelis>	Hello, everybody. I want to get my Wacom Bamboo Fun (which is an USB tablet you connect to the pc, used to draw pictures or animations on a computer, or write some things down) to work with Ubuntu Hardy. Many people had 'promised' (somewhat) that the Bamboo Fun would automatically work in Hardy. Up to now, it doesn't. There's not even a /dev/input/wacom . So how do i get it to work?
[neutral]	[07:14]	<m8m8y8>	youren ma
[negative]	[07:14]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays ah, if it's only with compiz, ask in #compiz-fusion. They know how that interacts with the various video drivers
[negative]	[07:14]	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: sounds like you'll need the alternate install cd
[negative]	[07:15]	<leonbrussels>	 zelrikriando: What does it say?
[negative]	[07:15]	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, I already tried them, no one responded.
[neutral]	[07:15]	<the_darkside_986>	"ok thanks. and is this the correct output of uname -a on my system that has Intel Celeron 3.2 Ghz: ""Linux hardy-desktop 2.6.24-16-generic #1 SMP Thu Apr 10 13:23:42 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux"" ?"

[negative]	[07:15]	<Tweaker>	Hola, I got a question about another game...Its called Eclipse and it allows you to build your own ORPG and I've got it working, but I can't enter the admin panel with the F1 button, why is this?
[neutral]	[07:15]	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, I believe it has something to do with xorg.conf
[negative]	[07:15]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker is it native or through Wine?
[neutral]	[07:15]	<Tweaker>	Through Wine
[neutral]	[07:16]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays crldb maybe, one of those meaningless character strings. He's already in bed probably, but is around nearly daily, for long periods
[negative]	[07:16]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: that s weird...I can run it through the terminal
[negative]	[07:16]	<SecretGirl>	dystopianray, the cd is fine i checked and there's no problem, its an original cd that i ordered
[neutral]	[07:16]	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: i think SMP means dual core/multi procs
[negative]	[07:16]	<damo22>	hi im trying to add cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
[negative]	[07:16]	<SecretGirl>	does anybody know how to install ubuntu from the shell, step by step
[negative]	[07:16]	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: still, it sounds like you'll need the alternate install cd
[neutral]	[07:16]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker F1 is already mapped in gnome, you need to change the mapping there first. Gnome hot keys will be use before wine
[positive]	[07:16]	<h00k>	harriseldon: Well, I turned the drive off for a bit, moved the usb cables a little, and it works now, automount and all.
[negative]	[07:16]	<the_darkside_986>	yeah that's why i am worried. and it would explain the awful behavior of the whole system. but it doesn't act like that on the live cd
[negative]	[07:16]	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, alright I'll try back in the morning
[neutral]	[07:16]	<mlw1>	anyone know what I might be doing wrong to have my display resolution overwritten on every reboot?
[negative]	[07:16]	<Tweaker>	Ok, how do I do this Harriseldon.?
[negative]	[07:16]	<jeanre>	does anyone have any ideas on this
[positive]	[07:16]	<h00k>	harriseldon: that scared me.  thanks for letting me think out loud about it ;)
[negative]	[07:17]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays between you and me, I don't use compiz on my 1100, it's just to freaking slow
[negative]	[07:17]	<jeanre>	my mode line does not work
[neutral]	[07:17]	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: all ubuntu is going to support SMP, so you're using the right one
[positive]	[07:17]	<harriseldon>	h00k anytime, I am glad that it worked
[negative]	[07:17]	<Aces|>	Anyone know if the Hardy Live CD has better Nvidia Graphics driver support than Gusty Gibbon did?
[neutral]	[07:17]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: try typing sudo apt-get install gedit
[negative]	[07:17]	<ChrisULM>	got a problem with hardy, i have a panel with icons at the bottom of my desktop, but when i restart it moves the panel to the top. whats going on?
[negative]	[07:17]	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: if performance isn't very good, you probably need to enable the nonfree video driver
[negative]	[07:17]	<damo22>	hi im trying to add hardy cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
[positive]	[07:17]	<nickrud>	Aces| it has the latest nvidia driver, while gutsy's was months out of date
[neutral]	[07:17]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: You already have that installed, but it will tell you where it chrashes
[negative]	[07:18]	<the_darkside_986>	I already have the non-free nvidia driver setup. The whole system lags and startup time is extremely long.
[neutral]	[07:18]	<zenlunatic>	Aces|: from my experience so far, yes.  all the multiverse etc is default
[negative]	[07:18]	<knapsack_>	Anyone know if there is an eclipse PDT (PHP Development framework) package in any Ubuntu repos?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: it s not crashing
[negative]	[07:18]	<Aces|>	ok thanks nickrud I just had quite a bit of troubling installing 7.10 with the live cd so I ended up having to use the alternate
[negative]	[07:18]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"the_darkside_986: what do you mean by ""lags""?"
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Aces|>	Ok thanks
[positive]	[07:18]	<Arelis>	For anyone who wants to get a Wacom Bamboo Fun to work in Ubuntu, click this link: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:18]	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, I think I'll disable it for now, I'm just frustrated that I went from Gusty, where everything worked, to Hardy where all I've had is graphics issues. I was kind of hoping things would get better.  Thanks anyways
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Aces|>	Ill give it a try
[negative]	[07:18]	<SecretGirl>	dystopianray, if there was a problem with cd, wouldn't the scan for defects return something
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Acoustyk>	Hardy is lagging!
[negative]	[07:18]	<Kl4m>	the_darkside_986: generic kernel enables SMP only if it can. the SMP mention is because it supports it.
[negative]	[07:18]	<jeanre>	why cant I run 1280x800?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<amazing_lady>	8.04 is cool
[negative]	[07:18]	<Acoustyk>	anyone know any quick fixes for this?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: So only synaptic is crashing?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<xepra>	anyone know xen well?
[neutral]	[07:18]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: only from the taskbar
[neutral]	[07:18]	<Tweaker>	Does anyone know what the F1 key does in gnome so I can unassign it?
[positive]	[07:18]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Acoustyk: obviously, you haven't given any details of the problem
[negative]	[07:19]	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: not if the problem is related to hardware incompatibilities
[negative]	[07:19]	<the_darkside_986>	Everytime I start a process such as synaptic, it seems that it tries to hog the CPU and even the mouse cursor freezes for a while.
[positive]	[07:19]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays all I can say is everything worked fine for me (beta install nearly 2 months ago, and updates since then. First time that Works for Me™ :)
[negative]	[07:19]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: I can start it from a terminal
[neutral]	[07:19]	<Acoustyk>	lol
[negative]	[07:19]	<harriseldon>	"Tweaker, I do not see the setting for F1 in keyboard shortcuts.  I am not sure where it is being ""trapped"""
[neutral]	[07:19]	<Acoustyk>	well when browsing I notice lag in the scrolling
[negative]	[07:19]	<Acoustyk>	very jagged and what not
[negative]	[07:19]	<xepra>	anyone know xen well? I had a question on the gui...
[negative]	[07:19]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker, does Eclipse have any way to remap the keys?
[positive]	[07:19]	<Acoustyk>	also my boot time has doubled
[negative]	[07:19]	<Tweaker>	Hmm, could it be some were else then?
[neutral]	[07:19]	<Tweaker>	Sadly no it does not, F1 always opens the Admin panels
[negative]	[07:19]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"the_darkside_986: try disabling ""visual effects"" in the Appearance settings"

[negative]	[07:20]	<jeanre>	Ok guys I am running the nvidia driver
[neutral]	[07:20]	<zenlunatic>	Acoustyk: wow.  lots of problems
[neutral]	[07:20]	<Acoustyk>	yea
[negative]	[07:20]	<jeanre>	I can not get 1280x800 to work for some reason even tho the lcd I selected is 1280x800
[negative]	[07:20]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Weird, dunno, maybe you  just want to do a clean install but copying your home directory so you can keep all you settings, thats what I'm gonna do when it finished copying
[negative]	[07:21]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: I dont want to do that
[neutral]	[07:21]	<jeanre>	I can go 1280X720
[negative]	[07:21]	<soreau>	Why would Hardware Drivers in Hardy not list an nVidia card as it did with RDM in Feisty?
[negative]	[07:21]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: Then I don't know, sorry :(
[neutral]	[07:21]	<SecretGirl>	i have installed ubuntu before on the laptop
[negative]	[07:21]	<SecretGirl>	no problems then, but i do have some malfunctioning hardware, do u think it has something to do with it
[neutral]	[07:21]	<SecretGirl>	cant i install ubuntu from a command prompt
[neutral]	[07:21]	<nickrud>	Tweaker Acoustyk isn't it alt-f1 for the panel menus?
[neutral]	[07:21]	<leonbrussels>	bye everybody, whish me luck for installing
[neutral]	[07:21]	<Acoustyk>	yea
[negative]	[07:22]	<Shadow_X>	what would happen if i added the 8.04 cd to the 7.10 repositories in synaptic?
[negative]	[07:22]	<the_darkside_986>	"A ""sudo apt-get update"" must be done to let non-free nvidia card drivers show up in the hardware manager if you didn't let the installer ""scan the mirrors"" during installation."
[negative]	[07:22]	<Acoustyk>	no problems with the panel other than a slight delay
[positive]	[07:22]	<Tweaker>	Uhm Im talking about the Panels in this game.F1 opens them and would alt F1 still affect the key mapping?
[negative]	[07:22]	<devin_>	anyone know of a way to resize the terminal and keep it at your desired size?
[negative]	[07:22]	<Acoustyk>	I found a tweak to solve the same problem in 7.10 tho
[negative]	[07:22]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Shadow_X: you would be upgrading to Hardy, which does work. however, that usually causes little bugs here and there
[neutral]	[07:23]	<nickrud>	Acoustyk it's modifiable, in metacity at /apps/metacity/global_keybindings, and compiz in ccsm in general options, keybindings tab
[negative]	[07:23]	<Shadow_X>	"NukeSkyjumper, just wondering. because i keep getting upgrade errors while trying to do a ""normal"" upgrade and im getting sick of it lol"
[positive]	[07:23]	<nickrud>	Acoustyk unless I've totally missed the question ;)
[negative]	[07:23]	<Shadow_X>	i have my stuff backed up anyway, so im not too concerned about a failure during upgrade
[neutral]	[07:23]	<Acoustyk>	lol yea you did
[neutral]	[07:23]	<Acoustyk>	im having lag problems
[negative]	[07:23]	<damo22>	hi im trying to add hardy cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
[negative]	[07:23]	<nick_>	im on ubuntu 7.1 just installed it 2 days ago would upgrading to 8 be better is there better support
[positive]	[07:23]	<nickrud>	I threw in that caveat when I saw you say lag just before :)
[neutral]	[07:24]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"Shadow_X: if you edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and change ""gutsy"" to ""hardy"" and then upgrade all packages, you should get a working hardy system"
[positive]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	monitors works via GUI in 8.04!!!
[negative]	[07:24]	<Johnny_5>	so i guess the consensus is that gutsy may still be better than hardy
[positive]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	:)
[neutral]	[07:24]	<Acoustyk>	yea
[positive]	[07:24]	<nickrud>	nick_ gutsy will have support for another year right here, as well as hardy

[neutral]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	"in 8.04 I cant enable ""normal"" effects"
[neutral]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	getting crash
[neutral]	[07:24]	<nickrud>	Johnny_5 I'm voting hardy big time
[positive]	[07:24]	<nick_>	sweet
[neutral]	[07:24]	<Johnny_5>	heh
[negative]	[07:25]	<laiya>	hey how do i cascade the windows ?
[neutral]	[07:25]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Wavesonics: do you have the nonfree video driver enabled?
[negative]	[07:25]	<Johnny_5>	i'm just not convinced i need 2 upgrade from gutsy quite yet
[neutral]	[07:25]	<nickrud>	I've run every release, and breezy for me was the most trouble free one, but hardy is running close
[negative]	[07:25]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker have you tried a virtual desktop with wine (use winecfg)? I am just guessing here since I do not know
[negative]	[07:25]	<Wavesonics>	NukeSkujumper: I dont think so, should I?
[negative]	[07:25]	<Tweaker>	Give me a second and I can try that
[neutral]	[07:25]	<Wavesonics>	I have an ATI card
[neutral]	[07:25]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Wavesonics: yeah, it'll enable 3d support
[negative]	[07:25]	<nickrud>	Johnny_5 waiting a couple weeks is not a bad idea, just in case some bad bugs suddenly crop up and need fixing
[neutral]	[07:26]	<NukeSkyjumper>	though i'm not sure how much better the nonfree ATI driver is than the open source one
[negative]	[07:26]	<Wavesonics>	ok
[neutral]	[07:26]	<NukeSkyjumper>	you should still try it
[negative]	[07:26]	<ricree>	devin_: not that I know of.  However, the man page says that if you add --geometry=(number of chars horizontal)x(number of chars vertical) it will set your terminal to a specified size by default
[negative]	[07:26]	<Johnny_5>	ah...
[positive]	[07:26]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics if you have a 9550 or later, you will need the restricted one to run 3d apps
[negative]	[07:27]	<laiya>	i recently saw a video of ubuntu where they were able to cascade the windows and it looked quite cool .. how does one do that ?
[neutral]	[07:27]	<devin_>	ricree ill give it a try
[negative]	[07:27]	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Settings. it's in there, somewhere
[neutral]	[07:27]	<harriseldon>	laiya it may have been with compiz-fusion (aka desktop effects)
[neutral]	[07:28]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"laiya: though you probably need to ""sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager"" first"
[neutral]	[07:28]	<XceII>	ya^
[positive]	[07:28]	<mudd`Hossam>	question: can ext3 filesystem and ntfs file system exist on one driver under different partitions? thank you
[negative]	[07:28]	<damo22>	"i want to upgrade from feisty to hardy can i just do ""dist-upgrade"" ?"
[neutral]	[07:28]	<dystopianray>	mudd`Hossam: yes of course
[neutral]	[07:28]	<nickrud>	mudd`Hossam yes
[neutral]	[07:28]	<Acoustyk>	anyone know how to stop lag in firefox 3 on hardy?
[negative]	[07:28]	<prodigel>	Hi. I'm having problems with gdm or something from gnome. My desk freezes just from checking properties on a panel applet, or trying to change desktop background. Alt+tab and other window shortcut keys still function. Could you help me trace to problem?
[positive]	[07:28]	<mudd`Hossam>	more specifically (a raid0 array of two drives)
[positive]	[07:28]	<mudd`Hossam>	YES, thank you very much
[neutral]	[07:28]	<nickrud>	damo22   do-release-upgrade   is preferred
[negative]	[07:29]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"Acoustyk: nobody knows what you mean by ""lag"". you need to be more specific"
[negative]	[07:29]	<Acoustyk>	the scrolling is awfully jagged
[negative]	[07:29]	<Lardarse>	"does anyone know what happened to the ""xmms"" package? it's in gutsy but not hardy"
[neutral]	[07:29]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: what is the cpu usage like?
[positive]	[07:29]	<harriseldon>	prodigel once you are in gnome, gdm is out of the picture
[negative]	[07:29]	<tijn>	Lardarse, i know!! :(
[neutral]	[07:29]	<nickrud>	damo22 it does some checks specific to ubuntu (don't ask me exactly what they are, one of the uber-geeks told me that)
[negative]	[07:29]	<Acoustyk>	how do I check that in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[07:29]	<tijn>	Bring back XMMS!!
[negative]	[07:29]	<timr92>	what's XMMS?
[neutral]	[07:29]	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: installing
[negative]	[07:29]	<XceII>	Lardarse:  check add remove, but first allow backports
[neutral]	[07:30]	<damo22>	nickrud: E: Invalid operation do-release-upgrade
[neutral]	[07:30]	<nickrud>	tijn they replaced it with xmms2
[negative]	[07:30]	<Lardarse>	XceII: i did
[neutral]	[07:30]	<hugol1>	hi, my nvidia doesnt work sine I installed hardy. In Launchpad a lot of people is complaining about the same. Anybody knows a way to solve it?
[neutral]	[07:30]	<ricree>	Acoustyk:  System>Administration>System Monitor
[neutral]	[07:30]	<Acoustyk>	i never knew how to check that on ubuntu
[neutral]	[07:30]	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: how will that app help me ?
[neutral]	[07:30]	<tijn>	xmms2 is a client server modell?
[negative]	[07:30]	<Acoustyk>	ok
[positive]	[07:30]	<XceII>	interesting, mine has it
[negative]	[07:30]	<Lardarse>	nickrud: umm... that sounds like a step backwards...
[negative]	[07:30]	<Prez00>	what's the feedback coming in, generally good, bad, average?
[neutral]	[07:30]	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: that app lets you configure all of the window managing effects
[negative]	[07:30]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Also, the top comand line utility will do that
[negative]	[07:30]	<laiya>	oh ok
[negative]	[07:30]	<prodigel>	harriseldon: ok, so something freezes in gnome and I don't know why. I've waited for updates hoping it will be solved, but nothing. Now 8.04 was launched and I'm still having problems
[positive]	[07:30]	<nickrud>	damo22 it's a command unto itself , /usr/bin/do-release-upgrade
[neutral]	[07:30]	<r00723r0>	I'm going to cry.
[negative]	[07:30]	<r00723r0>	I just found the most beautiful theme ever but the matching icons won't work :(
[negative]	[07:30]	<WGGMk>	I guess I can talk about Hardy in this channel now?????

[negative]	[07:30]	<timr92>	why is evry1 havin probs after upgrading to 8.04
[negative]	[07:30]	<FloodBot2>	r00723r0: Please don't flood, use @HLINK to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[negative]	[07:31]	<Lardarse>	Prez00: generally good from the people who did clean installs, and bad from people who upgraded... go figure
[neutral]	[07:31]	<r00723r0>	Not flooding.

[positive]	[07:31]	<Prez00>	Lardarse: great... i am looking to upgrade...
[negative]	[07:31]	<Wavesonics>	"Hi, i'm trying to enable my ATI proprietary driver and it says ""Invalid xorg.conf"""

[negative]	[07:31]	<WGGMk>	Is anyone else getting this systems asses handed to them by firefox3??? on hardy heron???
[neutral]	[07:31]	<Lardarse>	nickrud: <nickrud> tijn they replaced it with xmms2
[positive]	[07:31]	<Tweaker>	HarrisEldon: I love you :D It worked, thanks man! I owe ya and this IRC
[negative]	[07:32]	<Prez00>	Lardarse: guess I could clean install... got all my drive partitioned, /home is partition, so I guess I can go for clean reinstall
[neutral]	[07:32]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: cpu usage is at 40%
[negative]	[07:32]	<nickrud>	Lardarse heh. I don't use either, just keep track of what changes
[neutral]	[07:32]	<Halsafar>	"I have installed Ubuntu 8 on a machine that cannot get internet access, period.  I need to install packages via cdrom.  I used apt-cdrom add, apt-get update and the update always ignores the cdrom ""Ign: @HLINK"" -- I have cleared the apt cache dir, even reinstalled the entire distro... same problem"
[neutral]	[07:32]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: mostly firefox?
[negative]	[07:32]	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: installed .... how do i configure it ??
[neutral]	[07:32]	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: open the app and look around, it's self explanatory
[neutral]	[07:32]	<Tweaker>	Alright Im out thanks for the help
[neutral]	[07:32]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics try   sudo dpkg-reconfigure -pcritical xserver-xorg , then try the restricted driver again
[negative]	[07:32]	<the_darkside_986>	firefox3 isn't doing too much harm on Hardy but the whole system freezes momentarily everytime i open a GUI program. even the GDM login stutters badly. and startup time is miserable. I actually like firefox3 (finally, nice GTK2 form buttons)
[neutral]	[07:33]	<damo22>	Halsafar: try sudo apt-cdrom -m -d <mountpoint>
[neutral]	[07:33]	<WGGMk>	Halsafar: open up /etc/apt/sources.list and make sure it isnt commented out
[negative]	[07:33]	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: aaww... I was trying to prove to my friend that linux has come far enough u dont have to use the command line to set things up, oh well
[negative]	[07:33]	<chronographer>	Hi all. I have my new monitor working perfectly, except when I use the nvidia driver, I seem to be unable to get it to the correct refresh rate... Any suggestions?
[negative]	[07:33]	<laiya>	NukeSkyjumper: where is the app ? im new to linux
[negative]	[07:33]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: no it looks like xgl and gnome-do are more
[positive]	[07:33]	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Settings
[negative]	[07:34]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics bite your tongue, if they took away the command line I'd move to something else
[neutral]	[07:34]	<Wavesonics>	hehe
[positive]	[07:34]	<Wavesonics>	i do love the resolution/dual head tool :)
[neutral]	[07:34]	<areels>	i want to merge vob files and edit them, like adding watermark
[negative]	[07:34]	<Halsafar>	I tried that damo22,apt-cdrom just listed its help menu...  Yes I checked sources.list, it is not commented out.
[negative]	[07:34]	<kakalto>	"does firefox seriously say ""beta 5"" when you have it open on 8.04?"
[neutral]	[07:34]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: it spikes when firefox changes a page
[negative]	[07:34]	<areels>	what do i need to do that?
[neutral]	[07:34]	<eugenebythesea>	kakalto: yes
[negative]	[07:34]	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: ok i did it, now what
[negative]	[07:34]	<zelrikriando>	ok I have compiz to fix now
[negative]	[07:34]	<psypher246>	hey all, i need sum help getting ubuntu on the 2gb eee pc. how do i do a base install and build it up from there. i have the alternate cd  but no option for command line install. where to from here?
[negative]	[07:34]	<NukeSkyjumper>	areels: watermarking requires one to have no soul, i believe
[negative]	[07:34]	<ezzieyguywuf>	how can i detect the temperature on my t60p in hardy heron?
[negative]	[07:34]	<nickrud>	kakalto yes, mozilla hasn't released the final yet
[negative]	[07:35]	<kakalto>	okay, that's all. Just wanted to verify the insanity o_o
[negative]	[07:35]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Does the slowdown depend on how much javascript or flash is being used on the page?
[negative]	[07:35]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics now try the driver manager tool again
[negative]	[07:35]	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: try running: acpi -V

[neutral]	[07:35]	<XceII>	ezzieyguywuf:  gkrellm
[neutral]	[07:35]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics same error?
[neutral]	[07:35]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Also, how much free memory do you have?
[negative]	[07:35]	<kakalto>	nickrud, eugenebythesea, do canonical plan on including ff3 final when it is released?
[negative]	[07:35]	<prodigel>	harriseldon: can I find somewhere in logs info about this problems?
[neutral]	[07:35]	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: yes
[neutral]	[07:35]	<chronographer>	psypher: just install xubuntu
[positive]	[07:35]	<chronographer>	its a pain in the arse to try command line installing
[negative]	[07:35]	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: i got some text but no temp reading
[neutral]	[07:35]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics hm, put a copy of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf  on @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:35]	<creative>	hi
[neutral]	[07:35]	<luderacer>	hi
[negative]	[07:35]	<nikitis>	i need help with LVM and Grub.  I can't see my windows install.  Got switched somehow.
[neutral]	[07:35]	<psypher246>	chronographer: i know it is but how do u do it
[neutral]	[07:35]	<areels>	hi
[negative]	[07:36]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: free swap memory? (and yes flash makes it worse but this page is all text and it slows it down still)
[negative]	[07:36]	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: then you must have no temperature sensors accessible via acpi
[positive]	[07:36]	<eugenebythesea>	kakalto: i don't know.. sorry =)
[neutral]	[07:36]	<zelrikriando>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[07:36]	<luderacer>	i lub you all

[neutral]	[07:36]	<XceII>	lub?
[neutral]	[07:36]	<chronographer>	er.. download an xubuntu live cd, or alternate cd
[negative]	[07:36]	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: it worked in gutsy thoughh. shoud I just reinstall lm-sensors?
[positive]	[07:36]	<luderacer>	:)
[neutral]	[07:36]	<nickrud>	kakalto it'll be in backports for sure, and probably in main
[neutral]	[07:36]	<XceII>	lol
[negative]	[07:36]	<creative>	"how can i delete that stuff what hides flashes with a ""play"" button ??"
[negative]	[07:36]	<nick_>	just installed amarok all y music on another partiton when i go to import music that partition is not there
[negative]	[07:36]	<psypher246>	how do you do a command line install with ubuntu hardy not xubuntu
[neutral]	[07:36]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: physical memory.  Should be on the left in the System monitor resources tab
[negative]	[07:36]	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: does 'sensors' no longer show it?
[negative]	[07:36]	<chronographer>	if you do instlall to command line, type 'sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop' i think
[neutral]	[07:37]	<chronographer>	psy: google it
[neutral]	[07:37]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: 7.1 gigs
[negative]	[07:37]	<ezzieyguywuf>	dystopianray: what do you mean by 'sensors'?
[negative]	[07:37]	<NukeSkyjumper>	creative: do you mean Noscript for firefox?
[neutral]	[07:37]	<dystopianray>	nick_: did you mount it?
[neutral]	[07:37]	<dystopianray>	ezzieyguywuf: 'sensors' the program
[neutral]	[07:37]	<Wavesonics>	nickrud: @HLINK
[positive]	[07:37]	<psypher246>	thanks for the help, not like i just spent 20 mins trying to google it
[negative]	[07:37]	<kakalto>	is there a canonical channel? I'm awful confused as to why they've included beta5 (even labelled so, advertising beta-quality program) in their long-term ubuntu release, and yet fail to support any kubuntu as long-term.
[neutral]	[07:37]	<creative>	i dont know NukeSkyjumper...
[negative]	[07:37]	<syrus>	any body have any luck upgrading
[negative]	[07:37]	<XceII>	no script is the way to go.
[negative]	[07:37]	<ricree>	Acoustyk:  Are you sure about that?
[neutral]	[07:37]	<nick_>	dystopianray: it's shws up on my desktop

[negative]	[07:37]	<barmymatt>	Hi all. Has anyone had any luck with keepassx in AMD64 version?...
[negative]	[07:37]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: thats space on my hard drive
[negative]	[07:38]	<dystopianray>	kakalto: i don't believe canonical has ever supported kubuntu, they only care about ubuntu
[negative]	[07:38]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: what about the RAM
[neutral]	[07:38]	<nick_>	dystopianray: The partition shows up on my desktop
[negative]	[07:38]	<devin_>	ricree i got the command i need to resize the terminal but how or what do i config to save it?
[negative]	[07:38]	<dystopianray>	nick_: is it mounted?
[negative]	[07:38]	<psypher246>	so since i have already tried googling it, is there anyone else willing to tell me how to do a command line install of ubuntu hardy
[neutral]	[07:38]	<nick_>	dystopianray:
[negative]	[07:38]	<nick_>	dystopianray: how do i tell
[neutral]	[07:38]	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: are you trying to upgrade from an older version?
[neutral]	[07:38]	<syrus>	get the alternative cd

[neutral]	[07:39]	<psypher246>	then what
[negative]	[07:39]	<dystopianray>	dystopianray: right click on it on the desktop and see if the option is there to mount it
[positive]	[07:39]	<psypher246>	fresh install
[neutral]	[07:39]	<Wavesonics>	nick_: @HLINK
[negative]	[07:39]	<Acoustyk>	ricree: and 0 bytes of swap

[negative]	[07:39]	<steindani>	Hi! I'm using U. 8.04, and Intel sound card. There's sound, but I can't control it's volume.
[negative]	[07:39]	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: you mean, install ubuntu without the gui installer?

[neutral]	[07:40]	<Daisuke_Ido>	seamus7, yes
[negative]	[07:40]	<psypher246>	want MININMAL ubuntu installed and then build from there
[negative]	[07:40]	<chronographer>	psypher: have you tried putting the disk in and seeing if it is listed as an option?
[neutral]	[07:40]	<ricree>	devin_: right click on the icon you use to open the terminal and click on properties.  One of the boxes will say command.  Add the --geometry argument you want to use after gnome-terminal in that box
[neutral]	[07:40]	<psypher246>	yes
[neutral]	[07:40]	<zenlunatic>	eugenebythesea: me too, but now its acting up my net is 6mb but only getting like 300k on speed test

[neutral]	[07:40]	<psypher246>	no option
[negative]	[07:40]	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: if you just install normally, you can ctrl-alt-F1 to get your console
[neutral]	[07:40]	<Acoustyk>	riceree: get that?
[negative]	[07:40]	<zenlunatic>	eugenebythesea: disabled ipv6 and nothing
[negative]	[07:40]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"and then ""sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"" to take away the gui"
[negative]	[07:40]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics that's essentially identical to mine, except I have the synaptics touch pad config. You should file a bug. Try running   gksu -D /usr/share/applications/jockey-gtk.desktop /usr/bin/jockey-gtk , and adding the output of that and the copy of your xorg.conf to the report
[negative]	[07:40]	<psypher246>	no guys i know how to get to a command line
[neutral]	[07:41]	<julio_neto>	is possible uptade my ubuntu 7.10 to ubuntu 8.04 by CD???

[positive]	[07:41]	<devin_>	ricree got it. thanks for the help
[negative]	[07:41]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Then I'm not really sure what's up.  You might try seeing if it's a javascript issue, but it sounds like something other than firefox is causing the problem and I'm not sure what
[neutral]	[07:41]	<ricree>	devin_:  You're welcome
[negative]	[07:41]	<syrus>	i dont thin u can unless u install server edition
[negative]	[07:41]	<eugenebythesea>	<zenlunatic> hm.. i can't think of some reasons.. did u try things like torrents n dwnload managers?
[negative]	[07:41]	<nickrud>	julio_neto mostly, but you'll still need to get some packages from the net if you downloaded them during your gutsy run
[negative]	[07:42]	<NukeSkyjumper>	psypher246: if the alternate disc doesn't have the option, and you know enough to do it, i'd almost say try installing debian but using ubuntu apt sources
[positive]	[07:42]	<Acoustyk>	riceree: thanks then i appreciate your help
[neutral]	[07:42]	<nickrud>	julio_neto you'd need to use the alternate cd, as well
[negative]	[07:42]	<ricree>	Acoustyk:  Sorry that I couldn't do more

[negative]	[08:00]	<jburd>	boeing: do you have a broadcom card by any chance?
[positive]	[08:01]	<nikitis>	Ziroday, in my case, grub is booting, but does not point correctly to the windows partition or maybe it does, but needs some other command to boot it.
[negative]	[08:01]	<biabia>	did i screw up keeping my old 'menu.1st' when i upgrades to hardy
[negative]	[08:01]	<jburd>	those are the most stupid pieces of sh*t I've had to deal with

[negative]	[08:01]	<reeeh2000>	Dystopianray: Yeah, thats what I figured, I guess in a way its good.  Lots of people using ubuntu
[positive]	[08:01]	<dystopianray>	reeeh2000: you can always use a different mirror

[negative]	[08:02]	<AnRkey>	seamus7, yes, sadly so
[negative]	[08:02]	<spider_>	hi, is there any way to ask the system to reload my .bashrc without logging off from the system or wihtout closing the console i am working right at this moment?

[negative]	[08:03]	<jburd>	and I can't keep doing clean installs all the time on multiple machines
[negative]	[08:03]	<AnRkey>	seamus7, if i want more data once i am capped i have to pay another $30 USD for another 3gb
[negative]	[08:03]	<spider_>	"arj:  i tried it like this "". .bashrc"" but it doesnt seems like it reloaded my .bashrc"
[negative]	[08:03]	<Deathserver>	whats new in the new rlease and should i change

[negative]	[08:03]	<up365>	successful upgrade on 1 box, lost nvidia display settings until I installed nvidia X server settings and other than loss of google toolbar-not compatible with Firefox3,beta5 everything is good
[negative]	[08:04]	<ferris_>	yeah, if i can get my wifi hardy will be worth keeping
[neutral]	[08:04]	<icesword>	Deathserver, @HLINK
[positive]	[08:04]	<jburd>	upgrading from the cd NEVER works.

[negative]	[08:04]	<Yodude>	hey i got sound working !!!! but with alsa not pulseaudo, the problem must have been pulseaudio
[neutral]	[08:04]	<neeto>	Is there anyone in here that lost their 3d-windows/wallpaper plugin compatibility on compiz with their upgrade? Does anyone have a workaround?
[neutral]	[08:04]	<gharz>	dystopianray: i checked my synaptic and openoffice.org-java-common is already installed.
[negative]	[08:04]	<biabia>	none of my firefox extensions were compatible
[negative]	[08:04]	<Yodude>	maybe pulseaudio doesn't support all kinds of soundcards ?
[positive]	[08:04]	<Deathserver>	thanks, still need help with getting java installed
[neutral]	[08:05]	<biabia>	i wish the upgrade gave the option of upgrading firefox
[negative]	[08:05]	<biabia>	i woulda said no
[negative]	[08:05]	<dystopianray>	gharz: in openoffie's configuration have you set a jre for it to use?
[negative]	[08:06]	<neeto>	biabia: try the MR Tech Local Install plugin, you can disable compatibility checks, and then you can use your non-compatible plugins (no guarantees on how they will work though)
[negative]	[08:06]	<Moc>	Can't get Both Screen to work !!
[negative]	[08:06]	<gord>	jburd: dont BOTT the alternate to use as upgrade, just insert it into a ruinning system, then u get dialog box asking if u want packages upgraded (it auto-recognises u see)

[negative]	[08:07]	<jburd>	that is not a message an end user would like to see.
[neutral]	[08:07]	<AnRkey>	but my drive keeps trashing
[negative]	[08:07]	<AnRkey>	how can i turn indexing off?
[negative]	[08:07]	<gharz>	dystopianray: yes... under Tools->Options->OpenOffice.Org->Java ... have 3 java avail... 2 from Sun and 1 from Free Software Foundation... i ticked the radio button Sun Micro Inc. 1.6.0

[neutral]	[08:08]	<dystopianray>	reeeh2000: flashplugin-nonfree
[negative]	[08:08]	<GIn>	flash on linux is crap :(
[neutral]	[08:08]	<dny>	err
[negative]	[08:08]	<dny>	my sound keeps going out :/
[neutral]	[08:09]	<boeing>	reeeh2000, dint you get the popup when flash loaded first time to install flash?
[neutral]	[08:09]	<gord>	@HLINK
[negative]	[08:09]	<jburd>	and why the heck does an upgrade restart have to fetch all the necessary files *again* from the internet?
[positive]	[08:09]	<boeing>	the package which installs works perfect.
[negative]	[08:09]	<Jordan_U>	GIn, Hardy uses PulseAudio by default but Adobe's flash plugin doesn't play well with pulseaudio, if you want to solve the problem of not being able to use flash and other things at once install libflashsupport but that may lead lash to be less stable
[neutral]	[08:09]	<reeeh2000>	boing: i did, it list several choices
[positive]	[08:09]	<gharz>	"dystopianray: java version ""1.6.0_06 Java (TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_6-b02)"
[positive]	[08:09]	<Deathserver>	if i check the java version with java -version it says its the latest build but if i go to browser and enter about:plugins it isnt listed
[positive]	[08:09]	<boeing>	jburd, i recommended u not to use that *upgrade* option.
[positive]	[08:09]	<reeeh2000>	boeing: iv had problems on 7.10 with opening to full screen
[positive]	[08:10]	<dny>	is there a command to restart alsa?
[negative]	[08:10]	<jburd>	boeing: I have so many machines here.  I'm not crazy to do claen installs on all of them.
[negative]	[08:10]	<GIn>	Jordan_U: is libflashsupport the free flash alternative?
[negative]	[08:10]	<tparcina>	gord: I can't open that web page - time out :(
[negative]	[08:10]	<boeing>	reeeh2000, use the adobe-flash plugin
[neutral]	[08:10]	<jburd>	upgrades networkless or networked should be PAINLESS not PAINFUL.
[negative]	[08:10]	<Jordan_U>	GIn, No, it's a pulseaudio plugin specifically for nonfree flash
[negative]	[08:10]	<reeeh2000>	boeing: ok, i just hate using adobes stuff is all, thabks

[negative]	[08:11]	<GIn>	wonder why ubuntu included such an important piece of software in beta state in the OS
[positive]	[08:11]	<jburd>	ubuntu should start paying attention to the installation process more than adding tons of new features.  make that robust first.
[negative]	[08:11]	<Jordan_U>	GIn, Pulseaudio is stable, it's just that the pulseaudio plugin for flash can cause flash to crash
[negative]	[08:11]	<boeing>	jburd, remove all internet links in /etc/apt(?)

[negative]	[08:12]	<DJones>	nick_: k3b or gnomebaker are normally pretty good
[negative]	[08:12]	<neeto>	`mIRC`: In my humble opninion KDE is an ugly piece of crap that looks like a bargain bin windows knock off, and gnome is an original and beautiful piece of interface glory... but that's just me

[negative]	[08:20]	<please>	there is no driver
[neutral]	[08:20]	<please>	i just downloaded ubuntu and it says the drivers are included
[negative]	[08:20]	<Flannel>	jburd: If you have home on a separate partition, yes.  Otherwise no, the Desktop CD can only be used to install, not upgrade.
[negative]	[08:20]	<boeing>	so please has shown how wulluby(am i right with the name?) can go wrong in certain circumstances
[negative]	[08:21]	<raj1>	there is no such thing as motherboard drivers in ubuntu
[negative]	[08:21]	<boeing>	fat is a bad thing.
[neutral]	[08:21]	<raj1>	?
[positive]	[08:21]	<Kr0ntab>	Kirby: see ufw....  included by default... very simple to enable basic firewall.
[neutral]	[08:21]	<gord>	boing: wubi
[neutral]	[08:21]	<Kr0ntab>	Heya Flannel ... how ya doin man
[negative]	[08:21]	<Daisuke_Ido>	boeing, wubi, and it would be a shorter list if we listed ways it couldn't go wrong
[negative]	[08:21]	<boeing>	raj1, i mean motherboard-based drivers. eg. proprietry gphx drivers(if any), etc.
[negative]	[08:21]	<Kirby>	Kr0ntab: can I use 'learning mode' in it so that it doesn't allow any connections
[negative]	[08:21]	<raj1>	oh ok

[negative]	[08:22]	<biabia>	when i upgraded I didnt upgrade my menu.1st i kept the old one. is there a way I can upgrade just that file now? or could someone pastebin it from the new hardy, unmodified
[neutral]	[08:22]	<kindofabuzz>	will someone DCC the i386 alt torrent to me?
[negative]	[08:22]	<boeing>	Daisuke_Ido, that should be listed to M$ as fat is their baby and it does nt have journaling, which would actually have saved please
[neutral]	[08:22]	<Flannel>	biabia: `sudo update-grub` ought to do it
[positive]	[08:22]	<Kr0ntab>	ufw by default blocks all inbound ... and you have the ability to add rules as you see fit...
[negative]	[08:22]	<please>	for the last time i say this and if no one can help im going to reinstall ubuntu

[negative]	[08:35]	<tomasko>	`mIRC`: ext2 for the kernel /boot and ext3 for any data you care about (like your home dir, etc.)
[neutral]	[08:35]	<darryl>	Johnny_: that depends on the program, normally it would be  sudo ./configure && make && make install
[negative]	[08:36]	<`mIRC`>	Zloog : excuse me....why is that so?
[neutral]	[08:36]	<boeing>	"then go to a directory where u can find a file ""configure"""

[negative]	[08:36]	<hugol1>	Ziroday:  ok
[negative]	[08:36]	<Johnny_>	darryl: where do i even type this in
[negative]	[08:36]	<Ziroday>	kuru: eh?
[neutral]	[08:36]	<iusegnulinux>	ext3 is cool
[neutral]	[08:36]	<boeing>	Johnny_, open a terminal and cd to that folder
[neutral]	[08:36]	<boeing>	./configure
[negative]	[08:36]	<Johnny_>	boeing: what does cd mean
[negative]	[08:36]	<kuru>	ziroday, no animation
[positive]	[08:36]	<xepra>	'mIRC': ext3 is the slowest, but has the best failure recovery
[negative]	[08:36]	<Flannel>	nikitis: and rootnoverify gives the same error?
[neutral]	[08:36]	<raj1>	change directory
[neutral]	[08:36]	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, Are you sure it's not available in the repos or as a .deb file?
[neutral]	[08:36]	<iusegnulinux>	change irectory
[neutral]	[08:36]	<boeing>	Johnny_, cd means change directory

[positive]	[08:37]	<corbett>	hi, is there anyone who can help me get my maxtor external hard drive mounted and working on ububtu 7.10 - which ive just loaded on pc to replace windows, it worked perfectly fine elsewhere on widows, I think I need to run some checks as I dont know why it wont mount
[neutral]	[08:37]	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes it does

[neutral]	[08:37]	<Johnny_>	jordan: apache
[negative]	[08:37]	<nikitis>	Flannel: i assume you mean change root  (hd2,0) to rootnoverify  (hd2,0)
[negative]	[08:37]	<Flannel>	nikitis: Have you tried adding 'makeactive' after the root line?
[positive]	[08:37]	<`mIRC`>	thanx you guyz for advice :D
[neutral]	[08:37]	<Flannel>	nikitis: I do.
[neutral]	[08:37]	<Qrawl>	so about my question, does Hardy have builtin virtualization
[negative]	[08:37]	<Zloog>	mIRC: Your filesystem type usually doesnt matter too much. The only important thing is that it is journalizing, which ext3 is. Barring that, you don't need anything fancy unless you have a very particular need.
[neutral]	[08:37]	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
[negative]	[08:37]	<Johnny_>	jordan: i have extracted to the desktop can u tell me exactly what 2 type in the terminal
[negative]	[08:37]	<unop>	darryl, sudo ./configure && make && make install  probably wouldn't cut it ..  ./configure and make do not need to be run as root, make install does tho
[negative]	[08:37]	<mcp_>	How do i disable Tracker? I already removed the Session-Entries. Trackerd still starts from time to time.
[negative]	[08:37]	<gnuskool>	corbett: is it ntfs filesystem or linux filesystem
[neutral]	[08:37]	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes i believe so, i'll try again
[positive]	[08:37]	<xepra>	'mIRC': they all have their advantages and disadvantages - there are some great benchmarks out there tho

[neutral]	[08:38]	<zigford>	extra chees
[neutral]	[08:38]	<boeing>	Johnny_, open a terminal
[neutral]	[08:38]	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, It depends on what program you are installing, you may need to get dependencies for that specific program
[negative]	[08:38]	<Zloog>	corbett: How did you try mounting it?
[negative]	[08:38]	<darryl>	i've tried but it says my libstc++ is imcompatible, i think it has to do with it being 64bit, but how do you get it to use the 32bit libraries?
[negative]	[08:38]	<iusegnulinux>	how to get write permission to ntfs partition?

[negative]	[08:39]	<nikitis>	Flannel: you can see why i'm confused
[positive]	[08:39]	<Oprtz>	hello just install ubuntu 8.04 LTS and i love it, because it support my Intel 946GZ chipset and vga driver :) just want to ask how to minimize the screen resoultion, when ubuntu ask user name and password? after that i set my resoultion and ubuntu shift to that resoultion, thanks
[positive]	[08:39]	<generic>	nay one works on gosa?
[neutral]	[08:39]	<boeing>	Johnny_, you have to hence change to the dir where a file called configure is located.
[neutral]	[08:39]	<XceII>	backslash:  it now has a kitchen sink
[neutral]	[08:39]	<corbett>	Zloog:   well ive just plugged it in, ive tried a mount command, but as im new , im not sure, ive only just loaded ubuntu
[neutral]	[08:39]	<boeing>	Johnny_, then type ./configure
[neutral]	[08:39]	<unop>	iusegnulinux, it should be as straight forward as a simple mount, what happens when you try and write to the partition?
[positive]	[08:40]	<Johnny_>	boeing: i dont know what to type at all the file name is apache_1.3.4.1 and it is on the desktop can u put exactly what to type in quotes
[positive]	[08:40]	<Xperiment62>	anyone here able to help me find a suitable IRC client, query if able to help
[neutral]	[08:40]	<Zloog>	Corbett: cool, If you go to your PLACES menu in X windows and then down to computer, you should see your drive listed in there
[neutral]	[08:40]	<boeing>	"Johnny_, this means ""execute configure"", in the current directory, in unix"
[neutral]	[08:40]	<karbo>	Anyone else experienced this? I have managed to configure my ATI card to use dual screen, 2 desktops next to eachother, and this works fine on the login display. But as soon as I log in, it resets to cloned display.
[neutral]	[08:40]	<lalalala>	why is ubuntu so great?????????
[neutral]	[08:40]	<Zloog>	corbett: double click that and it should mount
[neutral]	[08:40]	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
[neutral]	[08:40]	<Johnny_>	boeing i am to confused
[negative]	[08:40]	<iusegnulinux>	i can mount it, read it, but cant write
[neutral]	[08:40]	<boeing>	Johnny_, apache is easier to install.
[neutral]	[08:41]	<boeing>	u dont need to compile from source.

[negative]	[08:41]	<Hikejinx>	I'm running Hardy on VirtualBox. Does anyone know of any tricks to get the restricted drivers to work on there? I can just install them in the cli I guess?
[negative]	[08:41]	<Jordan_U>	"Johnny_, ""sudo apt-get build-dep apache2"" what is wrong with Ubuntu's version though?"
[neutral]	[08:41]	<Zloog>	Did something change in 8.04 to make it so that my samba share settings arent saved in /etc/samba/smb.conf anymore? The shares are working fine, but I dont see the share settings in the smb.conf file anymore.

[negative]	[09:30]	<JCSmith1337>	Looks like im off to grab the 32 bit
[neutral]	[09:30]	<asc>	JCSmith1337: There can be a performance difference actually. For example, I noticed a 30% reduction in CPU with h.64 playback with 64-bit.
[neutral]	[09:30]	<JCSmith1337>	thanks so much!
[neutral]	[09:30]	<Fritzel>	where do you change the pointer theme?
[negative]	[09:30]	<arbrandes>	"Hey dudes, NFS4 problem: can't connect to an export on a Gutsy server, with the error: ""mount.nfs4: requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported"".  It worked just before the upgrade to Hardy.  Any suggestions?"
[negative]	[09:31]	<tobmalf>	I dont get it why people hate Hillary though.. UNTIL.. until I learn about this guy Peter Paul
[neutral]	[09:31]	<nikitis>	JCSmith1337: but what good is performance if you can't do anything with it
[neutral]	[09:31]	<iGraphiX>	For GeeXboX users: @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:31]	<asc>	he's already gone.

[neutral]	[09:31]	<hbaum>	hei
[positive]	[09:31]	<asc>	Also, I'd love to know what one can't do with 64-bit
[neutral]	[09:31]	<Jordan_U>	tobmalf, Try #politics
[negative]	[09:31]	<Naithin|AFK>	Does this release of the 64bit kernel work with Intel C2D chips?  I heard that it wasn't so well supported with the 7.04 release.
[neutral]	[09:31]	<Sajuukkhar>	it doesnt
[positive]	[09:31]	<ikonia>	DracoZA: it's dynamic
[neutral]	[09:31]	<Sajuukkhar>	my xorg screwed up too draco
[positive]	[09:31]	<asc>	Naithin|AFK: Yes, it works.
[neutral]	[09:32]	<IndyGunFreak>	"Fritzel: right click your desktop, change background, click the theme tab, whatever theme you have enabled(its probably labeled custom), click modify, then click the ""pointer"" tab"

[positive]	[09:32]	<Fritzel>	IndyGunFreak, excellent thank you
[positive]	[09:32]	<ikonia>	DracoZA: xorg trys to work out your hardware settings and is overriddent by the xorg config file
[negative]	[09:32]	<iGraphiX>	DracoZA and Sajuukkhar: You guys tried the restricted software? E.g. nVidia.
[neutral]	[09:32]	<arbrandes>	iGraphiX, i did, working fine here.
[neutral]	[09:32]	<iGraphiX>	Yes, here too.
[neutral]	[09:32]	<Sajuukkhar>	igraphic shall i link you to my post on ubuntuforums?
[negative]	[09:33]	<iGraphiX>	At some point takes control of your xorg. And I guess they are having this problem.
[negative]	[09:33]	<DracoZA>	ikonia ok, does nvidia-settings have a seperate conf file of some sort ?
[negative]	[09:33]	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, yes, please.
[neutral]	[09:33]	<ikonia>	DracoZA: that normally runs in memory
[negative]	[09:33]	<ikonia>	DracoZA: changes would have to be written to xorg.conf
[positive]	[09:33]	<Maxdamantus>	DracoZA, nvidia-settings save to the normal Xorg.conf
[negative]	[09:33]	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, read what ikonia just wrote.
[positive]	[09:33]	<Maxdamantus>	It does backups though, I think.
[negative]	[09:33]	<sephiroth>	hey have any of you managed to network into a PS3?
[negative]	[09:33]	<dny>	UGH, my sound keeps going out, and I have to restart for it to work again.  Is there a way to restart ALSA or something? :/

[negative]	[09:34]	<Ziroday>	How do I get hyperlinks in pidgin and thunderbird to open up in firefox?
[negative]	[09:34]	<DracoZA>	Maxdamantus will it read the backups if no xorg.conf exists ?
[positive]	[09:34]	<Rafik>	hello :)
[neutral]	[09:34]	<Maxdamantus>	DracoZA, no.
[neutral]	[09:34]	<ikonia>	DracoZA: no
[negative]	[09:34]	<Sajuukkhar>	just wait on
[negative]	[09:34]	<ikonia>	DracoZA: you have to tell it to read the files
[negative]	[09:34]	<Maxdamantus>	X looks for /etc/x11/Xorg.conf
[negative]	[09:34]	<Maxdamantus>	If it doesn't exist, it'll guess some settings./
[negative]	[09:35]	<Koheleth>	I have installed Ubuntu 64bit alongside Vista, but now I want Ubuntu 32bit because of program problems, if I just reinstall will it use the 64 bit partitioning etc or install along side the 64bit?
[negative]	[09:35]	<teban>	hi, how can i auto mount partitions on hardy? gutsy used to mount them automatically... hardy doesn't
[negative]	[09:35]	<Rafik>	please, I've a probleme with an USB flash disk.. KINGMAX 1Gb.. gutsy don't detect it at all
[neutral]	[09:35]	<Rafik>	can anyone help me ?
[neutral]	[09:35]	<ikonia>	Koheleth: you tell it what partition to use
[neutral]	[09:35]	<Maxdamantus>	teban, /etc/fstab?
[negative]	[09:35]	<Sajuukkhar>	my problem
[neutral]	[09:35]	<Sajuukkhar>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[09:35]	<OsamaK>	ikonia: That's meaning all programs that can be installed?
[neutral]	[09:36]	<ikonia>	OsamaK: all the ones written to the cd
[negative]	[09:36]	<teban>	yeah i've read about that... but i don't know exactly what i have to add to that file
[negative]	[09:36]	<ikonia>	OsamaK: dvd sorry
[neutral]	[09:36]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: there should be know issues with flash disk can you pastebin fdisk -l please
[negative]	[09:36]	<Koheleth>	ikonia: I hate messing with partitions :(
[neutral]	[09:36]	<Sajuukkhar>	but
[neutral]	[09:36]	<ikonia>	"Koheleth: ""select partition /dev/sda2"" is not ""messing with partitions"""
[neutral]	[09:36]	<teban>	the partitions are /media/sda1 and /media/sda5
[positive]	[09:36]	<OsamaK>	ikonia: you need a cup of tea to be more relax :-)
[negative]	[09:36]	<sephiroth>	yeah i got gutsy and i keep hearing that its predesessor was so much better
[positive]	[09:36]	<ikonia>	OsamaK: what ? I'm relaxed
[negative]	[09:36]	<Sajuukkhar>	im asking how do i just boot to the terminal and not to GNOME
[negative]	[09:37]	<Sajuukkhar>	recovery mode doesnt see my flash drive
[negative]	[09:37]	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: use recovery mode, or remove gdm from the start up runlevel
[neutral]	[09:37]	<Rafik>	Ziroday, i send you this in an mp ?
[neutral]	[09:37]	<Sajuukkhar>	or my Ipod
[negative]	[09:37]	<MrWGW->	the Ubiquity installer failed to install GRUB and didn't tell me about it, it just crashed (really crappy btw for an LTS release I must say)
[positive]	[09:37]	<Koheleth>	sda1 will be where my windows install is right
[positive]	[09:37]	<MrWGW->	what is the value that GRUB needs for the initrd?
[negative]	[09:37]	<bazhang>	Rafik: this is gutsy? I use the kingmax 8GB and see it fine (though this is Hardy)
[negative]	[09:37]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: no in pastebin
[negative]	[09:37]	<tobmalf>	z.z don't even remind me of that screw up dushantch
[negative]	[09:37]	<Sajuukkhar>	how do i use remove gdm?
[negative]	[09:37]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: none
[negative]	[09:37]	<Ziroday>	!paste | Rafik
[negative]	[09:37]	<MrWGW->	and are there any special parameters that the UBuntu kernel requires?
[neutral]	[09:37]	<ubotu>	Rafik: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[neutral]	[09:37]	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: update-rc
[neutral]	[09:37]	<neuronyk>	hi
[negative]	[09:37]	<sucka>	gord: i downloaded the deb file from the lop website and when i opened it it said that it was either corrupt or i di not have permission to open the file
[neutral]	[09:37]	<tobmalf>	what?
[negative]	[09:37]	<MrWGW->	iknoia: if I just tell it to boot /vmlinuz, the kernel panics
[negative]	[09:37]	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: sudo apt-get remove gdm
[neutral]	[09:38]	<Sajuukkhar>	k
[neutral]	[09:38]	<ikonia>	Ziroday: no no no no
[neutral]	[09:38]	<ikonia>	Ziroday: he meant from the start up
[negative]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, that's not an initrd.
[negative]	[09:38]	<Koheleth>	btw can ubuntu be uninstalled?
[neutral]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	That's a kernel.
[negative]	[09:38]	<Sajuukkhar>	i also have no mouse drivers
[positive]	[09:38]	<ikonia>	Sajuukkhar: that will delete it from your system
[negative]	[09:38]	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: wait stop
[neutral]	[09:38]	<ikonia>	Koheleth: no
[positive]	[09:38]	<Koheleth>	:)
[neutral]	[09:38]	<ikonia>	Koheleth: you have to delete it
[negative]	[09:38]	<Ziroday>	ikonia: woops, sorry
[neutral]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	The initrd is an initial filesystem image.
[negative]	[09:38]	<FloodBot2>	ikonia: Please don't flood, use @HLINK to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[neutral]	[09:38]	<MrWGW->	Maxdamantus: no duh
[neutral]	[09:38]	<Koheleth>	I thought so
[positive]	[09:38]	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: that command will delete from your system
[neutral]	[09:38]	<neuronyk>	does anyone know what option i have to give to grub in order to install in safe graphic mode ?
[positive]	[09:38]	<MrWGW->	yes quite, and GRUB says that /initrd.img does't exist, even though it does
[negative]	[09:38]	<IndyGunFreak>	Sajuukkhar: why do you need mouse drivers?
[neutral]	[09:38]	<tobmalf>	id
[neutral]	[09:38]	<Sajuukkhar>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[09:38]	<Sajuukkhar>	read
[negative]	[09:38]	<MrWGW->	and if I just tell it to boot /vmlinuz as the kernel, and do not specify an initrd, it panics
[positive]	[09:38]	<Rafik>	Ziroday : @HLINK thanks
[negative]	[09:38]	<Baughn>	Is there a netboot image for Hardy? There doesn't seem to be one on the cd I downloaded, like the howto suggests
[positive]	[09:38]	<Koheleth>	I think sda1 and sda2 are both windows
[negative]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, so you have /boot as a separate partition?
[negative]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	I'm primarily ticked that Ubiquity just crashed without even giving me a warning
[neutral]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	no
[negative]	[09:39]	<teban>	i read i should add these lines to fstab...
[negative]	[09:39]	<teban>	/dev/hda4 /media/nameyouchoose auto defaults 0 1
[negative]	[09:39]	<teban>	/dev/hda6 /media/othernameyouchoose auto defaults 0 1
[positive]	[09:39]	<stimpie>	I have a scrollwheel on my keyboard, does anyone know how to get that working?
[neutral]	[09:39]	<teban>	in my case...
[negative]	[09:39]	<Koheleth>	so I guess it will be sda3 I will choose to use for Ubuntu
[negative]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	"""/"" is one partitoin, there isn't even a separate home"
[positive]	[09:39]	<tobmalf>	all the time :)
[negative]	[09:39]	<Maxdamantus>	Then it doesn't. It'll be under /boot/initrd.img unless you specifically moved it to /
[negative]	[09:39]	<bazhang>	Baughn: should be; unetbootin would be the one--what is your host os
[negative]	[09:39]	<ikonia>	"MrWGW-: looks like your ""root"" is wrong then"
[negative]	[09:39]	<teban>	should it be /dev/sda1 /media/sda1 defaults 0 1?
[neutral]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	GRUB is installed on a different partition, the root of a Fedora install
[neutral]	[09:39]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: can you verify the thumbdrive is working?
[negative]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	my root is right (hd0,11), I know that because the kernel starts if I boot it
[negative]	[09:39]	<Baughn>	bazhang: Host os? Debian, I guess
[negative]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	it just panics, complaining about not synching
[positive]	[09:39]	<tobmalf>	thanks :D
[negative]	[09:39]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: so thats the problem then
[negative]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	ok, so what parameters does it require?
[negative]	[09:40]	<Rafik>	Ziroday : you mean, test it on another computer ?
[neutral]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	what is the address of the initrd, if there is one?
[negative]	[09:40]	<tobmalf>	yeah
[negative]	[09:40]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: yep
[negative]	[09:40]	<bazhang>	Baughn: if you /msg ubotu wubi you can read the ubuntuforums links on unetbootin
[negative]	[09:40]	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, boot a live!cd version, backup your files and do a clean install. If you're trying to repair all those errors it will take more than a clean install, so why bother, just install. And make sure you chose a closer mirror for the updates in the future.
[neutral]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	"initrd.img is ""not found"" by GRUB, even though I know it to be there..."
[neutral]	[09:40]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: what partition is your ubuntu install on
[negative]	[09:40]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: one where you know it works or is Windows/Mac
[neutral]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	(hd0,11)
[neutral]	[09:40]	<Sajuukkhar>	igraph, my internet downloads 25kb/s
[neutral]	[09:40]	<Sajuukkhar>	its the fastest i can get
[neutral]	[09:40]	<iGraphiX>	Auch!
[negative]	[09:40]	<DracoZA>	ikonia I use a nvidia card, will my system work properly if I dont use restricted drivers
[negative]	[09:41]	<bazhang>	Rafik: did you use the usbkey before? the kingmax I have is fine
[negative]	[09:41]	<MrWGW->	I'm in the GRUB console right now, so if you just tell me what to enter, I'll enter it, and then copy it over into the GRUB menu.lst
[neutral]	[09:41]	<ikonia>	"MrWGW-: initrd is not called ""initrd"""
[positive]	[09:41]	<Sajuukkhar>	and also
[neutral]	[09:41]	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, so you have 11 partitions + extended?

[negative]	[09:41]	<ikonia>	memetali: don't show
[neutral]	[09:41]	<ikonia>	memetali: don't shout
[negative]	[09:41]	<MrWGW->	hmm the kernel requires the root partition be passed to it as a parameter?
[negative]	[09:41]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: okay no prob, just try plugging the thumb drive into a different USB port
[positive]	[09:41]	<ikonia>	memetali: it gets you put on ignore
[negative]	[09:41]	<iGraphiX>	Then do a clean install with the 8.04 and that's it. There will be some time until next updates anyway.
[negative]	[09:42]	<Baughn>	bazhang: I don't have an OS on the machine I'm planning to install ubuntu on
[positive]	[09:42]	<ikonia>	OsamaK: they are the same system - different desktops
[negative]	[09:42]	<sucka>	gord: and the files that are download dont have an extension of .deb do i change it to it or not?

[positive]	[09:42]	<tobmalf>	" ""su user"" will keep the same prompt variables the user HAD... it won't cause it to change.. LordFrith, su - user will reset it, so could change the prompt"
[negative]	[09:42]	<tobmalf>	it does them too. but i haven't played with that much. i just make the round labels usually
[negative]	[09:43]	<MrWGW->	so what would the pathnames be then for the default kernel and initrd in 8.04?
[negative]	[09:43]	<Rafik>	Ziroday : I did it : same thing, the usb port is working with my optical mouse
[negative]	[09:43]	<Baughn>	bazhang: ..unetbootin looks like it should work, I guess. Wubi, not so much.
[positive]	[09:43]	<Sajuukkhar>	i know i can just screw up my xorg file and do it through
[neutral]	[09:43]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: mount your partition and look at what version your using

[neutral]	[09:49]	<MrWGW->	preme: use Add/Remove Software, or the Synaptic Package Manager, its fully automatic
[positive]	[09:49]	<artenius>	prem: If you use the synaptic package manager, it will put things in the right place for you.
[neutral]	[09:49]	<doogers>	it's possible have the wiki code of ubuntu?

[positive]	[09:50]	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: yes,... quite well actually... ony thing i've found is you have to manually add it to your startup programs so it starts on boot, beyond that though, i love it.. you can delete mails, mark spam, etc, w/o even loggig into your account

[negative]	[09:51]	<eckesicle>	I have my .evolution from a previous unix installation. Evolution does not seem to recognize my old settings if I just put it in ~/.evolution though. Is there anyway to import the settings?
[neutral]	[09:51]	<Sajuukkhar>	k
[negative]	[09:52]	<Fritzel>	I can't change pointer themes via appearance even though the option is there, does compiz or any other package fight with those settings for pointer themes?
[neutral]	[09:52]	<Ziroday>	Sajuukkhar: you can create a keyboard shortcut in Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts

[positive]	[09:53]	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: do a search for checkgmail  it will pop up
[neutral]	[09:53]	<MrWGW->	why that pathetic Ubiquity installer couldn't have just done its job I can't imagine, in my experience Ubiquity is one of the most brittle and untrustworthy installers of any Linux distro - I'd be using a different distro except I need LTSP
[negative]	[09:53]	<jeffimperial>	"I can't get my upgrade to work for a variety of reasons.. is there any way that i can in some way ""automate"" the transfer of all my stuff (docs, DLs, folders, torrents, mails, etc.) from Gutsy?"

[negative]	[09:53]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: there is not

[neutral]	[09:53]	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: synaptic is generally the way to go...
[neutral]	[09:53]	<arbrandes>	MrWGW-, haven't had any problems with it.

[neutral]	[09:55]	<bazhang>	MrWGW-: that is the likely source then
[negative]	[09:55]	<MrWGW->	for that matter, I'm at a loss as to why GRUB can't find the Ubuntu initrd
[neutral]	[09:55]	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: let it install...
[neutral]	[09:55]	<MrWGW->	well frankly, most distros handle multibooting just fine

[positive]	[09:56]	<hang3r>	unop, cheers, wasn't thinking, been a late night waiting for ubuntu release :)
[neutral]	[09:56]	<MrWGW->	*/the path of initrd/*: File not found
[positive]	[09:56]	<bazhang>	MrWGW-: multi-boot many distros here; ubuntu is one of the best at playing with others imo
[neutral]	[09:56]	<icqnumber>	lalalala, you do not really need wine, you can intall windows and linux on one computer, side by side, to play in windows, and to do the rest in linux
[neutral]	[09:56]	<preme>	IndyGunFreak: it's installed
[negative]	[09:56]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: the path should just be /

[negative]	[09:57]	<IndyGunFreak>	preme: you should get a window to configure your gmail account

[neutral]	[10:03]	<tobmalf>	system -> preferences -> keyboard shortcuts will let you set a shortcut for the terminal
[neutral]	[10:03]	<finger>	thx! bazhang: metacity keeps crashing whenever compiz starts

[negative]	[10:06]	<preme>	which msn clone messenger do you guys prefer?
[negative]	[10:06]	<IndyGunFreak>	XceII: oh ok.. i was used to it being right there.
[negative]	[10:06]	<MrWGW->	the boot process seems rather slow though, so it mgiht be stuck
[negative]	[10:06]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: as in what was the problem
[negative]	[10:06]	<Sajuukkhar>	actually 2, first one : how do i find my log files from my dapper>hardy update?
[neutral]	[10:06]	<bazhang>	arstanj: this is odd; that should do it

[negative]	[10:07]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: why where you using /boot ?
[negative]	[10:07]	<arstanj>	bazhang: yeah, purge seems not working, the system still knows that I had apache2 previously, so it's trying to use back old configs(but I moved them)
[neutral]	[10:07]	<Myrtti>	!offtopic | Fujisan
[neutral]	[10:07]	<ubotu>	Fujisan: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!

[negative]	[10:07]	<MrWGW->	ikonia, what do you suggest?  I was under the assumption, based on Maxdamantus's comments that /boot was where the default kernels were
[neutral]	[10:08]	<boeing>	bashca, ##windows
[neutral]	[10:08]	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, that's correct.
[negative]	[10:08]	<ikonia>	"MrWGW-: thats correct, but the ""root"" option (hd0,11) sets grub to where the stage1 files are (/boot) so / should work"

[neutral]	[10:37]	<SmokeyD>	ikonia: but the new config files have already been applied during package upgrade right?
[negative]	[10:37]	<teamcobra>	Sajuukkhar, make sure you properly unmount the mem stick before you remove it
[positive]	[10:37]	<ikonia>	LordOfThePigs: so the conflict is when started apache is in use

[negative]	[10:41]	<josh_>	hey is this the right channel to ask for help installing ubuntu?
[neutral]	[10:41]	<tobmalf>	bug 215442
[positive]	[10:41]	<theunixgeek>	guja_nebeska: that's because you upgraded, so synaptic still thinks your original cd is still a reasonable source
[neutral]	[10:41]	<theunixgeek>	josh_: yes
[positive]	[10:41]	<guja_nebeska>	ikonia, okay, let u know if I destroyed something. :)
[neutral]	[10:41]	<roffe__>	does anyone know why my mic won't get recognized by any program?

[negative]	[10:43]	<roffe__>	Linus-Trovalds: yeah, I can hear my voice in the speakers even, yet no software accepts the sounds
[negative]	[10:43]	<josh_>	huh?  i already have two windows partitions and one data partition.
[neutral]	[10:43]	<Samstone|Junior>	Hi all
[neutral]	[10:43]	<biabia>	In dmesg it says i need to update driver sd and sr
[negative]	[10:43]	<josh_>	so i would like to make it so that i have the kernal separate from my data
[neutral]	[10:43]	<Samstone|Junior>	Moin!
[negative]	[10:43]	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, it seems linux applies some kind of special protection to ports below 1024
[neutral]	[10:43]	<theunixgeek>	josh_: why?
[neutral]	[10:44]	<noob-africa>	greetings all my good people!
[neutral]	[10:44]	<LordOfThePigs>	ikonia, which means the user needs some specific permissions to access those private ports
[positive]	[10:44]	<josh_>	theunixgeek_: so i can change the kernal without losing the data
[negative]	[10:44]	<tobmalf>	the exact thing I was looking for, thanks
[neutral]	[10:44]	<Linus-Trovalds>	roffe__, in mixer, is mic mute?

[negative]	[10:48]	<theunixgeek>	arvind_khadri: the option is not there
[neutral]	[10:48]	<mijac>	do someone has a toshiba sattelite ?
[neutral]	[10:48]	<noob-africa>	gnuskool: thanks... i already saw the download link...
[positive]	[10:49]	<arvind_khadri>	josh_, yeah it is necessary
[negative]	[10:49]	<ikonia>	josh_: ram + %15 is areasonable guide
[neutral]	[10:49]	<ikonia>	josh_: but it's totally personal

[neutral]	[10:50]	<mijac>	but does not appears in the networks
[positive]	[10:50]	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; if your monitor is able to handle 1280x1024, you cant add the resolution to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[positive]	[10:50]	<ikonia>	josh_: but thats the personal bit
[neutral]	[10:50]	<TwinX>	can*
[positive]	[10:50]	<ikonia>	it depends on your personal situation

[positive]	[10:52]	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; i'm the king of typos :)
[negative]	[10:52]	<ikonia>	josh_: you have a reasonable ammount of swap so if you don't expect to use technologies like suspend, then lower the ammount
[positive]	[10:52]	<theunixgeek>	:)
[positive]	[10:52]	<TwinX>	:)
[negative]	[10:52]	<jeanre>	IndyGunFreak: you got any other ideas
[negative]	[10:52]	<theunixgeek>	TwinX: so, how do I add i?
[negative]	[10:52]	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi, can someone help me, ?
[negative]	[10:52]	<ikonia>	josh_: a reasonable ammount of ram that should read

[negative]	[10:54]	<mijac>	ooh thank god
[positive]	[10:54]	<mijac>	thank you negge
[negative]	[10:54]	<josh_>	ikonia:  so i basically need the swap file for when i hibernate, right?  then that means i should have a good sized swap if i put ubuntu onto my laptop?
[positive]	[10:54]	<negge^>	:D
[negative]	[10:54]	<mijac>	well the thing is about the atheros wifi
[negative]	[10:54]	<wild_oscar>	if anyone can have a look at why I need to /etc/init.d/networking restart if I want to access LAN's pc's with wireless: @HLINK
[negative]	[10:54]	<ikonia>	josh_: correct hence ram + %15-ish is an acceptable guideline
[neutral]	[10:55]	<ikonia>	josh_: but it does depend on your pesonal needs/use
[negative]	[10:55]	<teamcobra>	Lord: yeah, root needs to open any  <1024 port
[negative]	[10:55]	<josh_>	ikonia: does it need to be a separate partiton?
[neutral]	[10:55]	<gnuskool>	mijac: !ask
[negative]	[10:55]	<ikonia>	josh_: double your ram is insane
[neutral]	[10:55]	<ikonia>	josh_: swap partition is a seperate partition
[negative]	[10:55]	<mijac>	I have a problem with the atheros wifi
[positive]	[10:55]	<tobmalf>	 looking in kernel it looks like i have most of the options built in...except for the first and the last. I probably should trim some. ;)

[negative]	[10:56]	<TwinX>	theunixgeek; after saving the file, CTRL ALT BACKSPACE. (no need for reboot)
[positive]	[10:56]	<jeanre>	IndyGunFreak: how long does a UPGRADE take?
[negative]	[10:56]	<josh_>	ikonia: so if i am installing ubuntu through the installer on the live partition, but i want to manually set the partitions, what do i need?

[negative]	[11:10]	<sugarmice>	Hi people, I'm trying to automate some package installations; is it possible to force aptitude to accept a particular solution, if it claims it can't install?  For example, I'm trying to install emacs21 on a freshly installed 7.10 machine, and it offers various solutions because some of the dependencies are virtual packages.
[neutral]	[11:10]	<kimmey>	sCOTTo: if you got a nvidia-card, try the nvidia-config, ive done it that way and it woks good

[negative]	[11:13]	<Fritzel>	does anyone else have a problem with screenlets not remembering your configuration, OR remembering an old configuration that you've attempted to change many times?
[negative]	[11:13]	<biabia>	or maybe its not reading/loading my fstab?
[negative]	[11:13]	<panda>	JPSmon : are you using the driver from ralink?
[negative]	[11:13]	<ikonia>	bonhoffer: if you installed this, why does it not have the lsb tools OR the admin group
[negative]	[11:13]	<josh_>	ikonia:  easier to back up.  if all my data and programs are on a separate partition, i can just back that up because i don't mind reinstalling my OS's
[negative]	[11:13]	<JPSmon>	panda: I'm trying to use every driver available to me :OD  including ndiswrapper

[negative]	[11:17]	<josh_>	ikonia: that's what i wanted.  i know how big swap should be, but i still don't know how big to make the ubuntu partition, or how to tell ubuntu to install all programs and data on my data partition.

[neutral]	[11:17]	<ikonia>	josh_: the partiton sizes are up to YOU. I dont know how big you want your ubuntu install to be, or how your going to use it. The minimum I'd recommend is 4GB, but you should give as much as you feel you can to allow growth

[negative]	[11:19]	<slaytanic>	How can I get opaque window resizing? When I resize a window I get a horrible blue transparent rectangle instead of the window contents.
[negative]	[11:19]	<ikonia>	josh_: applications are split out across many directorys and mount points, for example apache web server, that is has the binaires (application) installed in /usr/bin, the config files are held in /etc, the log files are held in /var, to follow what you want, you'd have to have seperate partitions for /usr /var and /etc (you can't have a parttiion for /etC)
[negative]	[11:20]	<nikitis>	menu.lst looks correct to me
[neutral]	[11:20]	<ikonia>	josh_: it's not like windows where everything is stored in program files
[negative]	[11:21]	<josh_>	ikonia:  so there's no way i can have my programs on a separate partition from ubuntu(the OS)?  i can't the home directory on the data partiton along with everything else but the OS?

This is what all operating systems do. Ubuntu is a package of software/applications/binaries that run on the linux kernel. GNOME is the GUI (graphical user interface) much like windows uses Explorer.

[neutral]	[11:33]	<makkbe>	Tech_: irssi
[negative]	[11:33]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You can do that if you want. It will work but it's no advisable... It's probably a better idea to put your home directory on the partition that you backup. The home directory contains things like the linux equivalent of My Documents.
[negative]	[11:33]	<ifireball>	josh_: there is little reason to back up the Linux applications since they can be easily reinstalled with the package manager anyway, WRT to the data, just back up your home directory

[positive]	[11:35]	<inditech>	each time I start my new Hardy now, I have to run a modprobe wlan0 to get it to start the wifi - it works fine, but anyone know how I can get this command to run as root on startup?

[positive]	[11:35]	<sCOTTo>	jrib: no - and i DIDNT put it there either! but the prob is that I Cant get root :)
[neutral]	[11:36]	<makkbe>	inditech: put the module in /etc/modules
[negative]	[11:36]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You can make a folder on your partition that you backup... call it home... you can mount this as the linux default home directory... home is like Windows 'Documents and Settings'
[negative]	[11:36]	<jrib>	sCOTTo: are you sure?  That's how it is in the pastebin
[negative]	[11:36]	<inditech>	makkbe:  simple - thanks, sorry for n00b question!

[negative]	[11:37]	<icqnumber>	makkbe, wrong guess!
[positive]	[11:37]	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok, so how much space can a linux partition require?  and is the package manager in my home directory, so that if my home directory is on the data partition it will be backed up?
[negative]	[11:37]	<makkbe>	icqnumber: then i do not know
[positive]	[11:37]	<jrib>	icqnumber: check that it burned correctly.  verify the integrity of the cd (one of the options at the beginning)
[negative]	[11:37]	<nikitis>	Need an expert on GRUB. i've asked for help all night.  Broken system. no sleep. Question too complex. need someone to work with.

[neutral]	[11:38]	<icqnumber>	jrib, burned correctly, md5sum is okey!
[positive]	[11:38]	<nonewmsgs>	how do mount an image?  mount command said it is a nonblock device.
[positive]	[11:38]	<GNUtoo>	hello is a a geforce 8600M GT supported by ubuntu or do i need envy(i want the proprietary driver)
[negative]	[11:38]	<Zarin>	Hardy installer problem: I'm trying to install Hardy using the Live CD installer however when I get to the partition step the list contains nothing and all the buttons are disabled. Anyone know what it's trying to do?
[neutral]	[11:38]	<GNUtoo>	hardy of course...
[positive]	[11:38]	<jrib>	"sCOTTo: ok, there's no need for caps :)  just reboot, choose ""recovery mode"" from the grub menu and then use nano to edit /etc/hostname to remove the space and also edit /etc/hosts and add ""faithtop"" to the line with localhost"
[negative]	[11:39]	<nikitis>	Need an expert on GRUB. i've asked for help all night.  Broken system. no sleep. Question too complex. need someone to work with.

[negative]	[11:39]	<panda>	nikitis : whats teh problem?
[neutral]	[11:39]	<icqnumber>	jrib, i got it from fu-berlin mirror? does it makes a difference?
[neutral]	[11:39]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Things like settings, for programs and such
[neutral]	[11:39]	<timo>	arvind_khadri: yes
[negative]	[11:39]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Or do you mean the specific directories
[negative]	[11:39]	<ifireball>	josh_: for a home machine I think a 5GB partition for the OS/Applications would suffice and you should place /home on your data partition and make it as big as possible (so you can have a lot of room for your data)
[neutral]	[11:39]	<timo>	arvind_khadri: i log on as normal use thou

[negative]	[11:40]	<icqnumber>	jrib, u do not have a clue, right?
[neutral]	[11:40]	<ikonia>	"arvind_khadri: not ""sudo"""
[positive]	[11:40]	<ifireball>	josh_: since your home directory also contains all your personal settings, backing it enough is enough to get back a fully working system after a reinstall and a restore
[negative]	[11:40]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  so all my program data(preferences, documents(if i'm using a word eqivalent), etc) will automagically go into my home directory?
[negative]	[11:41]	<arvind_khadri>	ikonia, ok sorry a BIG MISTAKE,what do you want me to do
[negative]	[11:41]	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: think about what your saying to people
[neutral]	[11:41]	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: as I keep asking you
[negative]	[11:41]	<jrib>	icqnumber: nope, it's not suppose to do that.  Make sure you verified it using the option you are given when you boot the cd
[neutral]	[11:41]	<ifireball>	josh_: answering your question to Boredom_inc, yes.
[negative]	[11:41]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Yeah and you would put downloads and music etc. in there also

[negative]	[11:44]	<josh_>	ikonia; huh?
[negative]	[11:44]	<ikonia>	josh_: bad language is not called for
[neutral]	[11:44]	<Ubuntu2008>	stop swearing
[negative]	[11:44]	<josh_>	sorry.
[negative]	[11:44]	<ifireball>	josh_: I can't possibly think what 50GB of programs will be good for, windows programs are a mess
[neutral]	[11:44]	<joanjoseph>	good day every1
[negative]	[11:45]	<nikitis>	i'm about to start swearing.  i've been up for 24 hours straight trying to figure out this grub issue
[negative]	[11:45]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: If your used to backing up a partition all the time I recommend making a partition that is just your home directory... you then mount this folder in ubuntu and it is accessed a bit like a folder.... its at the location /home .... If you create a partition I can tell you how to make the partition mount at /home every time ubuntu boots up
[negative]	[11:45]	<timo>	I have a back up should i restore. Seems the upgrade was not successful.
[neutral]	[11:45]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, after i select 'try ubuntu without any change to your computer', the first screen appear, is a log in screen!
[negative]	[11:45]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i don;t actually have that much.  i just have no idea how much space linux programs take compared to windows.
[negative]	[11:45]	<ikonia>	icqnumber: and thats the gnome login screen ?
[neutral]	[11:45]	<mrjack>	josh_: this depends absolutly on the program
[negative]	[11:46]	<ifireball>	josh_: like I said, 5GB should be enough, as long as you make a separate /home partition
[negative]	[11:46]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, i do not know how does it look like, i have no ubuntu installed
[neutral]	[11:46]	<dexter>	arf
[neutral]	[11:46]	<ikonia>	icqnumber: can you take a screen shot ?
[positive]	[11:46]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, pink colours
[negative]	[11:46]	<julz>	with two crap compies, can i increase performance with a two node cluster? or is it not really practical?
[negative]	[11:47]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  i kind of know how the directory structure; my school uses solaris.  i just have no experience as an admin
[negative]	[11:47]	<dexter>	not a good idea the Firefox 3 in hardy
[neutral]	[11:47]	<panda>	josh_: generally much less space ...
[positive]	[11:47]	<nikitis>	Getting GRUB error 17, Grub bootloader is on /dev/sda as well as my windows partition.  /dev/sdb is where menu.lst is located and my /boot and linux partitions.  Any ideas why?
[positive]	[11:47]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You will probably find that you don't need as many programs on linux as windows. Linux programmers are quite adept at sharing libraries (in windows these are dll folders) so one program uses the features of many libraries. Pidgin is a good example (mind you it only uses a few libraries) but it works as a AIM, IRC, MSN, Yahoo (and more) client
[negative]	[11:47]	<josh_>	panda:  thanks; that's what i was looking for.
[neutral]	[11:47]	<vistakiller>	slaytanic you run compiz?
[positive]	[11:47]	<eckesicle>	josh_, I have a fresh install of ubuntu. with Office suite, and programming environment, browser email, the usual. That uses up approximately 4GB
[neutral]	[11:47]	<Boredom_inc>	dll files*
[neutral]	[11:48]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, menu.lst is /boot/grub/menu.lst
[positive]	[11:48]	<josh_>	ecksicle:  would a power user need more?
[negative]	[11:48]	<SoulChild>	Hey all, somehow the third mouse button (pressing first and second mb) does not work on my synaptics touchpad anymore,... any ideas ???
[neutral]	[11:48]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: yes it's on the 2nd drive sdb
[neutral]	[11:48]	<eckesicle>	josh_, I am a power user.
[negative]	[11:48]	<nikitis>	but my grub boot loader is on sda which I think is supposed to point to sdb
[neutral]	[11:48]	<Ubuntu2008>	anyone know how to recover from this error while upgrading to Hardy? @HLINK
[negative]	[11:48]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, did you try re-installing the grub
[positive]	[11:48]	<ifireball>	josh_: my current root partition (where the OS and all the programs are) currently has 2.2GB used and 3GB free after years of using the system, so 5GB should be enough
[neutral]	[11:49]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: i typed grub-install /dev/sda  It said it reinstalled but i still get the same error
[negative]	[11:49]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: if I'm not mistaken, I saw something like that when I upgraded
[negative]	[11:49]	<wild_oscar>	but it didn't stop the upgrade process
[negative]	[11:49]	<ifireball>	josh_: and I am a power user, I've stuff such as Apache and MySql installed the most users wouldn't need
[positive]	[11:49]	<Stred>	Hello... Ubuntu newbie Q1: I'm running a Live CD on an XP system. Ubuntu is not recognizing my dual monitors (Nvidia FX5200), only one. Could there be an easy fix or would I have to install Ubuntu  first before trying to install new video drivers?   Thanks!
[negative]	[11:49]	<josh_>	eckesicle:  sorry.  ok, so i really only need about 5GB of space.
[negative]	[11:49]	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: my computer has been hanging on that message for half an hour
[negative]	[11:50]	<immesys>	stred: yeah, you would probably have to install
[neutral]	[11:50]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, you need to follow some steps before that
[neutral]	[11:50]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: such as?
[neutral]	[11:50]	<eckesicle>	josh_, I am a power user. Games will naturally take up more space
[neutral]	[11:50]	<samalex>	Dues Ubuntu 8.04 server have some firewall enabled that doesn't allow IP's beyond the local subnet connect?  I've estup Ubuntu 8.04 server with apache and SSH, and even though I can hit them from other computers on the local network, I'm unable to hit it from the Internet, even though that system is setup as DMZ in router and GRC.com's Shields Up does show ports 80 and 22 open.
[positive]	[11:50]	<Stred>	thank you immesys

[negative]	[11:50]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: if u know where the upgrade log is, I can check if the message was the same
[negative]	[11:50]	<eckesicle>	josh_, sorry for repeat.

[positive]	[11:51]	<eckesicle>	then on the other hand i keep 500GB of media. So linux will not decompress that for you :)
[neutral]	[11:51]	<josh_>	ecksicle:  ok, is there a way to keeo linux separate from ubuntu so i can try installing other linux flavors?
[neutral]	[11:51]	<nikitis>	"arvind_khadri: I cannot do that.  When i type grub in the commandline after ""SU"" it comes back with a terminal error"
[positive]	[11:51]	<Stred>	immesys not likely to remaster a CD, thanks :)
[negative]	[11:51]	<eckesicle>	so you might want to keep your harddrive
[negative]	[11:51]	<eckesicle>	josh_ what do you mean?
[negative]	[11:51]	<timo>	can i have some guidance please @HLINK
[neutral]	[11:51]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, its sudo
[positive]	[11:51]	<ifireball>	josh_: maybe... but they're not the only one to blame, I find the windows programmers tend to be inefficient space-wise for various reasons (like not sharing components for example)
[neutral]	[11:52]	<eckesicle>	You can have different flavours on different partitions if you like, or virtualise.
[neutral]	[11:52]	<josh_>	ifireball:  </>joke</>
[neutral]	[11:52]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: found the log. it's the same message
[negative]	[11:52]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: that's assuming I can get into a linux session correct?
[negative]	[11:52]	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: d/w I fixed it. Seems like it's a known bug with gnome
[negative]	[11:52]	<banshe>	how do i remove a file extension,say .url from all files in a directory?
[negative]	[11:52]	<ifireball>	josh_: for your last question, that's just asking for trouble, and make little sense
[negative]	[11:52]	<immesys>	timo: replacing with package maintainers version is usually okay
[neutral]	[11:52]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: but my upgrade continued
[neutral]	[11:52]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, be on a live ubuntu cd and do this
[neutral]	[11:52]	<icqnumber>	"ikonia, not way to make a screen shot, tty1 says: ""user not known to the underlying authentication module""!"
[positive]	[11:52]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: it continued as well?
[positive]	[11:52]	<timo>	thanks
[negative]	[11:52]	<simion314>	anyone use no-script with firefox? i have a problem
[positive]	[11:52]	<jrib>	banshe: one way is to use the 'rename' command (see its man page for examples)
[neutral]	[11:52]	<Jookia>	Hi guys
[neutral]	[11:52]	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: after quite a while it did
[negative]	[11:52]	<josh_>	ifireball:  so what should i do if i want to have two separate linux distros?
[neutral]	[11:52]	<arvind_khadri>	banshe, use rename
[negative]	[11:53]	<banshe>	ok
[negative]	[11:53]	<amerio>	"why I try to use sudo to install a package I get that ""timestamp too far in the future:..."""
[negative]	[11:53]	<Boredom_inc>	Ubuntu comes with (by default) all most everything you need... CD/DVD burning software, bittorrent client, music player, office software, web browser, messenger client, PDF viewer, image manipulation software... The only software people really install (other than changing the default programs) is Programming environments and games... Games take up a huge amount of space obviously so you need to leave room on the ubuntu (not home) partition for games and c
[negative]	[11:53]	<ikonia>	icqnumber: I can't explain that
[negative]	[11:53]	<Glas`Awyr>	Question #1: Once my install finishes on my laptop and I have rebooted, I want to install an IRC client before I do anything else. I've only ever used mIRC on Windows and would like something similar. Any suggestions?
[positive]	[11:53]	<ifireball>	josh_: just install them on separate partitions, you can sometimes share the home partition, but it may not work all that well
[neutral]	[11:53]	<Jookia>	Glas
[neutral]	[11:53]	<arvind_khadri>	Glas`Awyr, xchat
[neutral]	[11:53]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc: what games?
[neutral]	[11:53]	<Jookia>	I'm using IRC on pidgin
[neutral]	[11:53]	<wild_oscar>	Glas`Awyr: pidgin
[neutral]	[11:53]	<oaihs>	howdy
[neutral]	[11:54]	<Jookia>	HOWDY
[neutral]	[11:54]	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok, thanks.
[neutral]	[11:54]	<[T]-Rex>	check out irssi
[neutral]	[11:54]	<wild_oscar>	Glas`Awyr: pidgin works with irc, msn, gtalk, yahoo, etc
[negative]	[11:54]	<icqnumber>	"this massage appears, 1o times, after ""loading, please wait"", can not even use tty1"
[negative]	[11:54]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: What do you mean by 'what games?'
[neutral]	[11:54]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, ??
[negative]	[11:54]	<Glas`Awyr>	I tried pidgin while using running from the Live CD and hated it. I'll take a look AT xChat.
[positive]	[11:54]	<wild_oscar>	Glas`Awyr: although, if u're used to msn, I strongly suggest amsn for that
[neutral]	[11:54]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  what games can you(do you) play on linux?  or are you just using Wine?  and how much space do you need?
[neutral]	[11:55]	<crashanddie>	josh_, same space as windows game
[negative]	[11:55]	<Jookia>	Hey guy, I'm in a position so tight I might aswell be on 4chan
[negative]	[11:55]	<samalex>	n/m, stupid Linksys router had some firewall enabled by default.
[neutral]	[11:56]	<_Rambaldi_>	josh_, nexuiz, openarena, are the ones i play (both like Unreal)
[negative]	[11:56]	<lclimber>	hello everyone, i am havin a proble with my just upgraded ubuntu system, it doesn't seem to recognize my headphones
[neutral]	[11:56]	<Jookia>	lclimber
[negative]	[11:56]	<mOrO^>	Help! Im looking at a screen that is about 20 times bigger than it is supposed to be.
[negative]	[11:56]	<josh_>	_rambaldi:  how much space do they take up?
[negative]	[11:56]	<banshe>	can someone tell me how to use rename? I am unable to understand the manpage
[negative]	[11:56]	<icqnumber>	"ikonia, this massage appears 1o times, after ""loading, please wait"", can not even use tty1, i have another distro installed on this box, does it makes a sence, actually not, well then the official mirror i got it from?"
[positive]	[11:56]	<crashanddie>	josh_, other than that, most games that are OpenGL based are Linux compatible (UT comes to mind, Quake, etc) Wine allows you to run Windows based games, by wrapping the API it needs. It's been a long time ever since I used wine, but support wasn't that bad
[neutral]	[11:56]	<unocrash>	hey
[negative]	[11:56]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I don't play games really but there are a surprisingly large amount of linux games. Not all that many AAA titles but there are a lot of native games that are very good. Otherwise you can just use Wine and run the games straight off your windows partition
[neutral]	[11:56]	<unocrash>	im just upgrading
[negative]	[11:56]	<Jookia>	I have a problem; I'm running off my live CD, transfering my backups to a 1GB flash drive and I need to burn a CD. What should I do?
[positive]	[11:57]	<_Rambaldi_>	i never really checked josh_ the package was about 240mb
[positive]	[11:57]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, once you're booted, you should be able to eject the CD
[negative]	[11:57]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  so would i need more than 5GB if i wanted to install a bunch of games?
[negative]	[11:57]	<Xiliath>	anyone tried hildon on hardy?
[negative]	[11:57]	<[^martin]>	Hi all, I've just got my Ubuntu install up and running and have connected succesfully to my wireless network. I am having trouble connecting to specific endpoints that other machines on the network are not. For example, www.mozilla.org works. www.google.com does not. How would I go about troubleshooting this?
[neutral]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	Martin
[negative]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	Goto about:config
[neutral]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	And find IPv6
[neutral]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	In the search bar
[negative]	[11:58]	<immesys>	martin: try turning off ipv6
[positive]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	And set that to true
[negative]	[11:58]	<[^martin]>	ah
[negative]	[11:58]	<FloodBot2>	Jookia: Please don't flood, use @HLINK to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[neutral]	[11:58]	<crashanddie>	josh_, yeah, definitely
[negative]	[11:58]	<[^martin]>	ok, 2 secs
[neutral]	[11:58]	<dreamcoder>	any reccomend what to install ubuntu or kubuntu?
[positive]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Ubuntu is best
[neutral]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	But if you come from windows
[neutral]	[11:58]	<tiramisu>	dreamcoder: you can install kde on ubuntu
[neutral]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Get Kubuntu
[negative]	[11:58]	<mosno>	Gnome Menu icons are blank for newly installed GTK+ applications (installed via aptitude on 8.04) -- anyone know what the issue is here?
[neutral]	[11:58]	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, depends on what you like most, if you prefer KDE or Gnome
[negative]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Or if you come from Mac
[positive]	[11:58]	<josh_>	crashanddie:  how much would you recommend?
[neutral]	[11:58]	<banshe>	it is dependent on ur taste
[neutral]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Use Ubuntu
[neutral]	[11:58]	<_Rambaldi_>	what happened to ubuntu-bots
[negative]	[11:58]	<immesys>	dreamcoder: kubuntu looks nicer but I'm having grief installing it, so use ubuntu rather
[neutral]	[11:58]	<amerio>	guys the wireless driver exists but wireless doesnt work please help
[neutral]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	Amerio
[negative]	[11:59]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I recommend allocating about 4 GB (ubuntu) + 5 GB (or less for games)... Because by the sounds of it you intend to play windows games and I assume they are already installed on your windows partition, you don't need to reinstall them on linux
[negative]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	My friend had this problem
[negative]	[11:59]	<tiramisu>	ubuntu should be used even if you want kde since kubuntu is dependency hell
[neutral]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	Disable IPv6
[negative]	[11:59]	<banshe>	can someone tell me how to use rename? I am unable to understand the manpage
[negative]	[11:59]	<lclimber>	hello everyone, i am havin a proble with my just upgraded ubuntu system, it doesn't seem to recognize my headphones
[negative]	[11:59]	<crashanddie>	josh_, I don't know, depends on the games you want to play... Take about 10Gig for WoW, 12Gig for a normal CS/HL2/CS:S install
[negative]	[11:59]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Mind you not all of them will run
[neutral]	[11:59]	<amerio>	Jookia how to disable IPV6?
[neutral]	[11:59]	<dreamcoder>	ok will try ubuntu thanks
[negative]	[11:59]	<osfameron>	tiramisu: I thought kubuntu was just ubuntu+kde_desktop ?
[negative]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	I'm not sure how globaly.
[negative]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	But there's a firefox config
[neutral]	[12:00]	<Xiliath>	osfameron, it basicly is, but some applications are different
[negative]	[12:00]	<banshe>	lclimber, thats y u should not use upgrade.
[negative]	[12:00]	<crashanddie>	tiramisu, please don't spawn ideas like that, thank you
[neutral]	[12:00]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  they aren't installed yet;  is there a way to install the games on a separate hard drive from ubuntu?
[neutral]	[12:00]	<Jookia>	Yes
[negative]	[12:00]	<crashanddie>	josh_, of course, mount that drive to your filesystem, and install them there
[negative]	[12:00]	<tehgeek>	Oh em gee.  The package servers seem uber-bogged down.  T_T
[negative]	[12:00]	<Ubuntu2008>	amerio, do you know the make of your wi-fi card?
[negative]	[12:00]	<ifireball>	crashanddie: shouldn't those games be installed to some other partition, say /usr/local or /opt ?
[neutral]	[12:00]	<Jookia>	Tehgeek: That's cause of 8.04 upgrades.
[neutral]	[12:00]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: What type of headphones? USB or standard headphone jack?
[neutral]	[12:00]	<crashanddie>	josh_, you might need to setup a new wine_C_drive, and set it to that given mount point
[negative]	[12:01]	<tehgeek>	Jookia, Yeah, I figured.  Still is a bummer.  =X
[negative]	[12:01]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: sorry, i'm trying it now
[positive]	[12:01]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, Jookia, you can always blacklist kernel module ipv6 in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[neutral]	[12:01]	<ele_Acaro>	SALVE A TUTTI ------------------------------
[positive]	[12:01]	<[^martin]>	"Jookia: disabled that IPV6 in Firefox, still no luck. It gets to ""Waiting for host..."" and just hangs there. Definitely a firefox issue though - just tried telnetting to the host"
[negative]	[12:01]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, thats ok
[neutral]	[12:01]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc standard
[negative]	[12:01]	<josh_>	crashanddie: no idea what that meant, but that's ok, i just wanted to know if it was possible.
[neutral]	[12:01]	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 Atheros AR242x
[positive]	[12:01]	<ele_Acaro>	HI TO ALL -----------------------
[negative]	[12:01]	<NekoKun>	Is there any ubuntu distro that is minimalist? Just kernel + basic commands, not including any GUI, just basic drivers? Like an 'apt-get' version... that anything extra than the most needed stuff must be downloaded...
[neutral]	[12:01]	<Jookia>	Where would I go about finding my firefox bookmarks file?
[neutral]	[12:01]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: So it's not using the correct sound card then
[neutral]	[12:01]	<obnibolongo>	lol hi ele_Acaro
[negative]	[12:01]	<crashanddie>	josh_, if you're going to install wine based games, Wine is going to create a virtual Windows drive (filesystem), just save that virtual drive on the other hard disk, so you can use that space
[positive]	[12:02]	<obnibolongo>	NekoKun, Gentoo Linux? :P
[negative]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: the server version is pretty basic
[negative]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	if you want ubuntu
[positive]	[12:02]	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 and its enabled and in Use
[negative]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	otoh, debian netinstall is even more basic
[negative]	[12:02]	<arvind_khadri>	NekoKun, that would be gobuntu
[neutral]	[12:02]	<NekoKun>	makkbe: How many gbs it needs to install?
[neutral]	[12:02]	<crashanddie>	NekoKun, you could also try Arch Linux
[negative]	[12:02]	<jPratt>	I dont see any differences really in 8.04
[neutral]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: under 600 mb
[neutral]	[12:02]	<ele_Acaro>	I FORGOTTEN THAT HERE IT'S USED ONLY ENGLISH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[negative]	[12:02]	<josh_>	crashanddie: ok, so does a swap file of 5GB(i have 4 gb ram) and a Ubuntu partition of 5GB sound reasonable?
[positive]	[12:03]	<NekoKun>	Well, so far Debian EeeOS is the best option... mmm < 600mb
[neutral]	[12:03]	<crashanddie>	but yeah, I'd recommend the netinstall of Debian as makkbe said
[neutral]	[12:03]	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: stop with the caps
[negative]	[12:03]	<ifireball>	josh_: why don't you go ahead and install? I think you'd have a fairly good grasp of the answers to all your questions within a month... and if you get it wrong the 1st time, just go ahead and reinstall, its fairly painless
[negative]	[12:03]	<obnibolongo>	ele_Acaro, don't use caps, it's considered yelling
[negative]	[12:03]	<neeto>	In 7.10, when I clicked on things in the system tray, it would switch to whatever workspace the corresponding window was on... it doesn't seem to do that anymore. How do I make it so that it does?
[negative]	[12:03]	<ele_Acaro>	excuse me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[neutral]	[12:03]	<Boredom_inc>	"lclimber: Type ""cat /proc/asound/modules"" in terminal and check to see your soundcard (that the headphones are plugged in) is listed"
[negative]	[12:03]	<NekoKun>	What's the main difference between debian and ubuntu?
[positive]	[12:03]	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: and the exclamation marks as well, please
[negative]	[12:03]	<crashanddie>	josh_, I'd say 5Gb is a bit minimalistic, to be honest, I'd shrink the swap to 2 gig, and give the 3 extra gig to your root
[negative]	[12:03]	<ifireball>	josh_: at 4GB ram your should have about 4GB swap
[positive]	[12:03]	<dagon_>	ele_Acaro; abuse of ! is also considered rude
[neutral]	[12:03]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: ubuntu is a customized debian
[negative]	[12:04]	<neeto>	NekoKun: honestly? Sexiness.
[neutral]	[12:04]	<mademelaugh>	really
[negative]	[12:04]	<makkbe>	one can say
[neutral]	[12:04]	<mademelaugh>	!swap
[positive]	[12:04]	<ubotu>	swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See @HLINK for more info
[negative]	[12:04]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc it says 0 snd_hda_intel
[negative]	[12:04]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc that's it
[positive]	[12:04]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: debian generally use older packages in their stable versions
[neutral]	[12:04]	<josh_>	ifireball: about?
[negative]	[12:04]	<crashanddie>	mademelaugh, I wouldn't use 4gig swap on any desktop computer that has 4Gig of ram... He'll never use it :/
[negative]	[12:04]	<NekoKun>	makkbe: So, in a way I could say that doing the correct patches/kernel I could get a debian install and turn it into a ubuntu?
[negative]	[12:04]	<ele_Acaro>	am i bad for you ?
[neutral]	[12:05]	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 ?
[negative]	[12:05]	<neeto>	In 7.10, when I clicked on things in the system tray, it would switch to whatever workspace the corresponding window was on... it doesn't seem to do that anymore. How do I make it so that it does?
[positive]	[12:05]	<NekoKun>	Ok... I hate old things :p
[negative]	[12:05]	<banshe>	how do i remove a file extension,say .url from all files in a directory?
[neutral]	[12:05]	<crashanddie>	NekoKun, you can always try Debian sid
[positive]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: if you use one of the newer debian branches, yes
[negative]	[12:05]	<mademelaugh>	crashanddie, yep, wise choice
[neutral]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	sid or lenny
[neutral]	[12:05]	<ifireball>	josh_: partition sizes, what installs where, games, etc.
[negative]	[12:05]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: go to System -> Preferences -> Sound and press test for something other than capture... you should hear a beeping noise (you may have already tried this)
[positive]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	lenny is probably recommended
[neutral]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	sid is really unstable from time to time
[neutral]	[12:05]	<mademelaugh>	what
[neutral]	[12:05]	<mademelaugh>	isn't here ubuntu
[negative]	[12:06]	<Jookia>	How would I go about accessing my /home/jookia/.Trash folder ON ANOTHER HARDDRIVE
[negative]	[12:06]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Let me know if you heard anything
[negative]	[12:06]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, where did you mount it ?
[negative]	[12:06]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i heard a swap file 1.15 times the size of your RAM was a good amount; is that too much?  if it's just virtual memory, does it ever need to be a bigger size than my RAM?
[neutral]	[12:06]	<Jookia>	disk-1
[positive]	[12:06]	<ele_Acaro>	i would like learn more from you but i like much not be a problem for you !
[negative]	[12:06]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, that's not a valid mount point
[negative]	[12:06]	<amerio>	obnibolongo so disabling VP6 would make my wireless work?
[negative]	[12:06]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, a mount point is something like /media/disk1, or /mnt/mydisk
[negative]	[12:06]	<josh_>	ifireball:  this is installing on my laptop, btw
[negative]	[12:06]	<ifireball>	NekoKun: you can say that about any Linux distro, doesn't make sense time-wise to do stuff that way though
[negative]	[12:06]	<NekoKun>	I'm asking that cause I have an EeePC, and want something like eeeXUbuntu... but IMHO it has too much garbage installed....
[negative]	[12:06]	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: just ask whatever you want to know then
[negative]	[12:06]	<Kirby>	is ubuntu supposed to be slower than windowsxp ?
[negative]	[12:07]	<mrjack>	if you boot ubuntu with low graphics, eg xdriver not installed correctly, ubuntu starts with 800x600 - in that resolution, the update-manager and many other programs are using more than 600px in height, but they cant be resized making it impossible for the user to klick the ok or next button...
[negative]	[12:07]	<arvind_khadri>	ikonia, i would like you to read this @HLINK
[neutral]	[12:07]	<Jookia>	/media/disk-1
[negative]	[12:07]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: do you want a gui?
[negative]	[12:07]	<neeto>	Kirby: are you a troll or are you honest?
[positive]	[12:07]	<mademelaugh>	Kirby, not really, you cannot compare mem management with xp
[positive]	[12:07]	<NekoKun>	makkbe: I plan to instal xfce later, but I don't want kde/gnome uneeded files around
[negative]	[12:07]	<makkbe>	ok
[negative]	[12:07]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: If you have lots of RAM your swap file will rarely be used but as a general rule a swap file roughly the size of your ram is good
[negative]	[12:07]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc yes, i have sound, the proble is that it dosen't redirect the sound to my headphones when i plug them
[negative]	[12:07]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, I don't know, I though you'd asked how to disable IPv6, I told you how, I didn't know what was leading to it, sorry
[positive]	[12:07]	<Kirby>	well my ubuntu is certainly slower than windowsxp
[neutral]	[12:07]	<mademelaugh>	Kirby, when refer to linux, it cannot be very fast, but it is stable, it just works
[negative]	[12:07]	<Paavi2_0>	Kirby: yes and no. some things are much faster and some things you'd think to be slower
[negative]	[12:07]	<crashanddie>	josh_, 4Gigs of RAM is quite an enormous amount, I doubt you'll ever need all of it. I seriously doubt you'll ever need more than 4Gig, your swap would probably never be used
[negative]	[12:07]	<makkbe>	then i suggest a debian lenny or arch
[negative]	[12:08]	<neeto>	NekoKun: I am coming into the middle of this conversation, but if you don't want gnome/kde, why not just use xubuntu?
[neutral]	[12:08]	<finek>	hi
[positive]	[12:08]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  thanks
[negative]	[12:08]	<crashanddie>	"josh_, you need swap ""to be safe"", but 2gigs of swap is by far enough with the enormous quantity of RAM you have access to"
[negative]	[12:08]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> my wireless driver is enabled and in use but no wireless , do u have ny idea about that?
[negative]	[12:08]	<ifireball>	josh_: the rule of thumb is that up to 2GB swap = ram*2; beyond 2GB its swap=ram; and beyond 4GB it doesn't mater... too much swap can cause trashing, though I doubt the swap will even get used on a 4GB desktop machine
[neutral]	[12:08]	<arvind_khadri>	Boredom_inc, @HLINK
[positive]	[12:08]	<dagon_>	neeto; or fluxbuntu ;)
[negative]	[12:08]	<tyranos>	hi everyone , what do i need to install to get  my fn keys to work on my laptop
[positive]	[12:08]	<NekoKun>	neeto: I've installed it and found good sized KDE and gnome folders on it
[positive]	[12:08]	<NekoKun>	also, it uses a LOT of space
[positive]	[12:08]	<case_>	Kirby, ubuntu can be seen as slower than winxp, as winxp si slower than dos... you have to compare the features too...
[negative]	[12:08]	<josh_>	crashanddie:  what about when i hibernate/sleep?  (i'm on a laptop that i use for school)
[neutral]	[12:08]	<tehgeek>	tyranos, You need to hit the fn-lock key maybe?
[positive]	[12:08]	<tehgeek>	:P
[negative]	[12:09]	<mademelaugh>	coz you know, harddisk 's speed cannot compare with memrory
[neutral]	[12:09]	<ruewan>	hi
[negative]	[12:09]	<neeto>	NekoKun: well to run most apps you need some gtk/kde stuff, like any python programs or amarok, which is kde...
[positive]	[12:09]	<finek>	what can i do when only one of speakers works and another one isnt?
[positive]	[12:09]	<Kirby>	I am talking about GUI, gui in ubuntu is slower than in windows xp- browsing files, opening jpgs, text...
[negative]	[12:09]	<crashanddie>	josh_, swap isn't used at that point
[negative]	[12:09]	<ruewan>	i just instaled hardy
[neutral]	[12:09]	<neeto>	dagon_: flux is icky
[neutral]	[12:09]	<Jookia>	 /media/disk-1/home/jookia/.Trash = permission denied.
[neutral]	[12:09]	<ruewan>	my hard drive has been going nonstop since i installed it
[neutral]	[12:09]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, well, which wireless card do you have?
[neutral]	[12:09]	<Kirby>	case_: what features???
[positive]	[12:09]	<josh_>	ifireball: thanks.
[negative]	[12:09]	<dagon_>	neeto; can't be worse than xfce
[neutral]	[12:09]	<finek>	Jookia, sudo
[negative]	[12:09]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, because you mounted it and don't have write perms on the mount point
[negative]	[12:09]	<Jookia>	how do I sudo thefile browser?
[neutral]	[12:09]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> Atheros AR242x
[neutral]	[12:09]	<neeto>	dagon_: that's where you're wrong good sir.
[negative]	[12:09]	<NekoKun>	dagon_: Why 'worse than xfce'?
[neutral]	[12:10]	<dagon_>	Jookia; sudo nautilus
[neutral]	[12:10]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, ouch...
[neutral]	[12:10]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Are your speakesr built-in or are they plugged into a different soundcard?
[negative]	[12:10]	<josh_>	ifireball:  do you think a 2GB swap would be fine as well?
[neutral]	[12:10]	<dagon_>	NekoKun; never liked xfce
[neutral]	[12:10]	<case_>	Kirby, about gui features, 3d desktop, font antialiasing, file preview, vector icons... etc...
[positive]	[12:10]	<dagon_>	neeto; okey :p
[negative]	[12:10]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, mount /media/disk-1 -o remount,rw,umask=0 or something like that, check the man page
[negative]	[12:10]	<Kirby>	can I make ubuntu faster, disabling its so called features?
[neutral]	[12:10]	<tyranos>	thegeek , thx i ll try it
[negative]	[12:10]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> not supported?
[positive]	[12:10]	<finek>	what can i do when only one of speakers works and another one isnt?
[neutral]	[12:10]	<Jookia>	Kirby is a troll. I'm sure.
[neutral]	[12:10]	<neeto>	@HLINK
[negative]	[12:10]	<james__>	Anyone else having audio problems? Mine sounds VERY grainy. This because of Pulse Audio?
[positive]	[12:10]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc they are built in, its a laptop
[positive]	[12:10]	<NekoKun>	dagon_: I never liked gnome... can't explain why...
[negative]	[12:10]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, don't know, I had problems with an atheros a while ago, checking which one was
[positive]	[12:10]	<tyranos>	tehgeek, but the volume up key works
[negative]	[12:10]	<ifireball>	josh_: depends on what you're gonna be running, but generally with 4GB ram, yeah.
[negative]	[12:10]	<flithm>	"hey everyone, I just installed 8.04 here, and I don't get any 3d acceleration (nvidia) like I did with gutsy... anyone know what's going on?  The hardware drivers utility says it's detected ""nvidia_new"" but it's not in use"
[negative]	[12:10]	<neeto>	xfce is not ugly in the least
[negative]	[12:10]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: 2GB might even be a bit excessive but there is no harm in having one too big as long as you can spare the harddisk space
[neutral]	[12:11]	<case_>	Kirby, you sould try Xubuntu if you have an old hardware. less features, less needs.
[negative]	[12:11]	<Glas`Awyr>	Trolls are usually looking for cybersex... ahem...
[negative]	[12:11]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:i'd rather be safe than sorry.
[negative]	[12:11]	<Glas`Awyr>	xChat looks like what I'm looking for. Thanks #Ubuntu.
[positive]	[12:11]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> used to work on gutsy ! but I made a fresh install for hardy and stopped working =)
[neutral]	[12:11]	<dagon_>	NekoKun; okey.. well xfce to me.. is too lightweight
[negative]	[12:11]	<Kirby>	though when scrolling pdf it;s superfast in ubuntu, I couldn't find such fast pdf viewer in windows
[positive]	[12:11]	<case_>	Kirby, but Xubuntu comes with XFCE as Desktop manager, not Gnome...
[neutral]	[12:11]	<josh_>	ifireball:  what would/might require a bigger swap?
[negative]	[12:11]	<ruewan>	how do i tell what process is reading my hard drive
[negative]	[12:11]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, so how many ram
[neutral]	[12:11]	<finek>	how to reinstall audio drivers?
[negative]	[12:12]	<ifireball>	Boredom_inc: actually there is harm in that, but not in a desktop scenario I guess
[negative]	[12:12]	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd.
[neutral]	[12:12]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; one
[negative]	[12:12]	<inspired>	I just installed hardy. with desktop effects enabled the window titlebar is missing when a window loses focus. using an nvidia graphics card. anyone else seeing this?
[neutral]	[12:12]	<ele_Acaro>	!addon
[negative]	[12:12]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about addon - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[12:12]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, how many megabytes
[negative]	[12:12]	<ifireball>	josh_: a heavily loaded server software like a database for example
[negative]	[12:12]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, first of all, let me warn you, I told you that thing about IPv6 by mistake, I suppose I used the tab completion with the wrong nick ^^but anyway, I'll try to help you
[neutral]	[12:12]	<james__>	Is audio quality a known issue with Hardy?
[neutral]	[12:12]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; count 'em yourselves
[negative]	[12:12]	<NekoKun>	neeto: xUbuntu used a lot of space... and once I can't easilly uninstall packages (as it's easy in windows), I preffer to get a single minimal install and aptget it application by application
[neutral]	[12:12]	<dagon_>	-s
[neutral]	[12:12]	<tyranos>	tehgeek, i need brightness buttons to work
[neutral]	[12:12]	<dagon_>	gah
[positive]	[12:13]	<Boredom_inc>	ifireball: No you're going to make him doubt me :P
[neutral]	[12:13]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; yourself*
[negative]	[12:13]	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok thamks, now i know i'll be fine with 2, since i don't do anything like that.
[neutral]	[12:13]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> no problem buddy , Im listening
[negative]	[12:13]	<Kirby>	maybe the default graphics driver in ubuntu is not good for my videocard?
[neutral]	[12:13]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, what? run free in terminal, mine is 256m
[negative]	[12:13]	<Boredom_inc>	﻿lclimber: Look around in @HLINK ... I'm not really sure what the problem is if it's not switching to the headphones... I assume it works in Windows or whatever your previous OS was?
[negative]	[12:13]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, wait a minute or so
[neutral]	[12:13]	<case_>	Kirby, what videocard do you have?
[negative]	[12:13]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> take your time
[negative]	[12:13]	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd. Any ideas? I'm afriad my computer might explode if it tries to read the system from CD while burning a CD
[positive]	[12:13]	<Tasmaniak>	Hi, since installing Hardy my disk usage (as in activity) is always around 60% and it's starting to worry me...is there likely something wrong?
[neutral]	[12:13]	<Kirby>	case_: an old one NVIDIA GeForce MX-200
[neutral]	[12:14]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; 14740
[negative]	[12:14]	<flithm>	hey everyone, what's the ubuntu way of configuring xorg to use my nvidia driver?  Should I just edit the xorg.conf?
[positive]	[12:14]	<tehgeek>	tyranos, Oh, those buttons.  :P
[negative]	[12:14]	<case_>	Kirby, you probably have to install the nvidia propretary driver to get decent video acceleration...
[negative]	[12:14]	<latarsky>	would torrent be faster or a downloader like prozilla or flashget ?
[negative]	[12:14]	<DracoZA>	flithm, tried nvidia-settings in a terminal ?
[positive]	[12:14]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc yes, it works on windows, thanx anyways
[negative]	[12:14]	<Boredom_inc>	jookia: Lol why are you on the live CD and download the 8.04 CD?
[negative]	[12:14]	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd.
[negative]	[12:14]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, 1.4g? ram? then gnome kde you can choose whatever you want
[negative]	[12:14]	<Jookia>	boredom:
[negative]	[12:14]	<Kirby>	case_: acceleration? do you mean d3d ogl stuff?
[negative]	[12:15]	<ifireball>	btw, since games were mentioned, does anybody here knows of a nice fast FPS which isn't network-deathmatch-oriented?
[neutral]	[12:15]	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, desktop search? Check for Indexing service...
[neutral]	[12:15]	<Jookia>	It's a long story, upgrade from alt-cd mounted broke 7.10 on HDD, recovering data onto flash drive using Live CD, now up to this problem.
[neutral]	[12:15]	<josh_>	ifireball:  so if i'm at the partition preparations screen of my ubuntu install, in addition to my swap what do i need to create (other than my Ubuntu partition) and what do i mount where?
[positive]	[12:15]	<flithm>	DracoZA: it's not installed :)  so what's the deal, the last ubuntu version automatically detected my nvidia card and gave me compiz and stuff, but not 8.04?
[positive]	[12:15]	<Boredom_inc>	ifireball: do they even exist :P
[positive]	[12:15]	<case_>	Kirby, opengl only on linux, but yes, that's what i mean. but it also benefits to 2d rendering
[positive]	[12:15]	<DracoZA>	flithm, I'm installing as we speak so I cant tell you yet :)
[negative]	[12:15]	<Glas`Awyr>	Okay #Ubuntu, I am now running Linux on my laptop.
[negative]	[12:15]	<ifireball>	Boredom_inc: they used to >_>
[negative]	[12:16]	<Tasmaniak>	obnibolongo: I thought of that, but it says Tracker is idle.
[positive]	[12:16]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; say what? :P it's 14.7 meg
[negative]	[12:16]	<tyranos>	so none knows how to get all the fn keys to work
[neutral]	[12:16]	<ifireball>	josh_: you need a /home partition
[negative]	[12:16]	<tyranos>	maybe i need keytouchd
[negative]	[12:16]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, what? i cannot believe that? try run less /proc/meminfo now
[neutral]	[12:16]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i will put that on my ntfs data partition, so it get backed up.
[neutral]	[12:16]	<bXi>	does anyone know the difference between vanilla firefox and ubuntu firefox?
[neutral]	[12:16]	<Pord>	Can any1 help me with a problem im having with my xorg and graphics card.... @HLINK
[negative]	[12:16]	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, I've never found a good util to see what's accessing a disk, I usually nailed them (disk (ab)users) at using top... If you find a better app tell me!
[neutral]	[12:16]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You said you would play windows games... make a separate partition and mount it as /windows (Here you can install games that are windows only) mind you save some space for linux games on the linux partition
[negative]	[12:17]	<Kirby>	case_: I'll download it later at night. What else can I do to make Ubuntu faster (1. XFce 2. NV driver ...)
[negative]	[12:17]	<Glas`Awyr>	"I have encountered my first ""problem"": A Restricted Drivers warning has appeared. It is telling me that my wireless network card driver is proprietary. Is this a real problem?"
[negative]	[12:17]	<Boredom_inc>	"josh_: Actually you can mount it as anything.. ""/games"" might be more appropriate"
[negative]	[12:17]	<NekoKun>	There's no Ubuntu version of netinst and business card installer?
[negative]	[12:17]	<gluer>	Q: how do i change the default icons, such as folder icons?
[negative]	[12:17]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; what difference was it supposed to make? it's still 14.7 meg free, I'm running vmware at desktop 2, that explains it
[neutral]	[12:17]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  games will be on the computer i'm building this summer.  my laptop can't play games well.
[neutral]	[12:18]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, you had it working before how? ndiswrapper?
[negative]	[12:18]	<ifireball>	josh_: not a very good idea I'm afraid, since NTFS isn't 100% compatible with Linux, you better make a separate ext3-formatted partition for /home and back it up with Linux tools
[positive]	[12:18]	<amerio>	"gluer: u need to install a new icons , then copy them to "".icons"" folder in Home directory"
[negative]	[12:18]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, hmm, that expains it
[neutral]	[12:18]	<mediacenter>	Ciao a tutti
[neutral]	[12:18]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> I had it working without ndiswrapper
[negative]	[12:18]	<case_>	Kirby, try nvdriver first. and don't download it form the nvidia website. you should find dozen of tutorial on how to set it up on the ubuntu forum...
[neutral]	[12:18]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, which driver?
[positive]	[12:18]	<kernando>	Helllo is there a way to enable a wireless connection and a lan connection at the same time in ubuntu?
[negative]	[12:18]	<mediacenter>	c'è qualcuno che può aiutarmi con una scheda Pinnacle?
[positive]	[12:18]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; sorry if I confused you :)
[neutral]	[12:18]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, out-of-the-box?
[negative]	[12:19]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Ahh ok... So this computer you're using now already has windows. Yeah it's probably best to create a separate /home partition like ifireball said.
[positive]	[12:19]	<wild_oscar>	gluer: System > Preferences > Theme > Customize > Icons.
[neutral]	[12:19]	<Kirby>	case_: not from website???
[neutral]	[12:19]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, indeed
[negative]	[12:19]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> the same one but I really have no idea how it worked before
[negative]	[12:19]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i thought linux could read and write ntfs.  what problems does it have?  how big can home partitions get?
[negative]	[12:19]	<case_>	Kirby, all these stuff are in the ubuntu repositories, so you don't need to trust a third party website
[negative]	[12:19]	<case_>	Kirby, how many RAM do you have in this PC ?
[negative]	[12:19]	<ifireball>	josh_: the security scheme for example is completely different
[neutral]	[12:20]	<JPSmon>	can someone help me with some module drivers?
[positive]	[12:20]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  my data partition has no os on it.  xp and vista have their own partitions, and my data has its own partition as well.
[positive]	[12:20]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: It can read and writes NTFS... I use it all the time because my brother keeps the music on the windows partition. I've never encountered troubles but technically linux isn't 100% NTFS compatible.
[negative]	[12:20]	<Kirby>	case_: 768MB, so how do I install a better driver then?
[neutral]	[12:20]	<JPSmon>	like how to install and uninstall them?
[negative]	[12:20]	<sn0rlax>	hi... I just installed server 8.04 i386. and mysqld_safe is using 100% cpu. funny thing is, there are no databases in mysql yet...
[neutral]	[12:20]	<inspired>	anyone gotten flash working on Hardy AMD64?
[positive]	[12:20]	<ifireball>	josh_: Linux uses the UNIX 12bit permission scheme while NTFS uses complex ACLs
[neutral]	[12:20]	<kernando>	does anyone knonw how to? i want to connect to my other computer while still connected to the internet??
[negative]	[12:20]	<Boredom_inc>	oh yeah and the security is different. Linux can delete whatever it feels like from NTFS
[positive]	[12:20]	<gluer>	wild_oscar: i dont have themes in my menu, just appearance
[negative]	[12:20]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, well... use forums or google for it, it's the best I can say you... Use @HLINK for a quickstart
[positive]	[12:20]	<josh_>	boredom_inc: would you recommend putting my home directory on a data only ntfs partition?
[negative]	[12:21]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> how about madwifi do u think its gonna work?
[negative]	[12:21]	<josh_>	ifireball:  would it be ok if i don't plan to encrypt anything?
[neutral]	[12:21]	<ifireball>	josh_: no
[neutral]	[12:21]	<MarV->	hi
[positive]	[12:21]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Probably not. I'd recommend it's own ext3 partition.
[neutral]	[12:21]	<Tasmaniak>	obnibolongo: I had a look with top as suggested, and I think it may have been the mythtv-backend, I killed the process and it seemed to quieten down a bit. Thanks.
[neutral]	[12:21]	<Glas`Awyr>	Question #3: I understand there is an incredibly easy way to install software (sudo something...) where can I find out more about that?
[negative]	[12:21]	<sn0rlax>	anyone else having problems w/ mysqld_safe maxing out cpu? ( no databases loaded even )
[negative]	[12:21]	<josh_>	ifireball: how big can a home directory get?
[positive]	[12:21]	<ifireball>	josh_: the different permission scheme may cause all kinds of unexpected problems for various programs
[negative]	[12:21]	<MarV->	can someone name me the tool witch installs newest nvidia driver automaticly?
[neutral]	[12:22]	<tyranos>	envy
[neutral]	[12:22]	<Villarroel>	Hi.
[positive]	[12:22]	<MarV->	ahh right thanks
[positive]	[12:22]	<Boredom_inc>	﻿josh_: In fact if you want you could mount the ext3 home directory in windows. I do this also... mind you windows has even less support for ext3 than linux has for NTFS. I did it mostly cause it looks cool :P
[positive]	[12:22]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, can't tell you without having messed with that Atheros in particular more... Which I haven't :) (a firend of mine had that wireless card and I gave up trying to make it work on 7.10 :P)
[neutral]	[12:22]	<tyranos>	MarV-, the tool is named envy
[neutral]	[12:22]	<ifireball>	josh_: depends on what you put in it, this is where all your documents/files/music/video/settings goes to by default
[negative]	[12:22]	<wild_oscar>	gluer: then I don't know
[positive]	[12:22]	<obnibolongo>	amerio: Google, Forums, and you'll find something. The page I told you had windows drivers which worked well with ndiswrapper :)
[positive]	[12:22]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> I'll try to mess things up now ! if I make it work I'll let you know how ;)
[positive]	[12:22]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, good luck :)
[neutral]	[12:23]	<wild_oscar>	gluer: appearence

[neutral]	[12:23]	<wild_oscar>	you have icons there
[negative]	[12:23]	<Boredom_inc>	﻿Glas`Awyr: You mean 'sudo apt-get install <packagename>'?
[positive]	[12:23]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, :)
[negative]	[12:23]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  could i mount my ext3 directory in my ntfs data partition?  i don't care if windows can't read it.
[negative]	[12:23]	<case_>	Kirby, you only need to install packages from the package manager (synaptic) .  you can try to install the package nvidia-settings, it should eventualy set it up to you, but i'm not 100% positive on that point...
[positive]	[12:23]	<wild_oscar>	"btw, can anyone check if ""help"" works on appearence?"
[negative]	[12:23]	<MarV->	are there any problems with envy in 8.04?
[neutral]	[12:24]	<mademelaugh>	!ext3 | josh_
[positive]	[12:24]	<ubotu>	josh_: ext3 is the default filesystem on Ubuntu, and the most popular on Linux. You can read/write from Windows to ext3 via @HLINK

[positive]	[12:24]	<case_>	Kirby, setting up the proprietary driver for nvidia videocard is one of the most documented question on ubuntu, i'm not the most qualified to help you...
[neutral]	[12:24]	<neeto>	cool
[negative]	[12:24]	<obnibolongo>	neeto, but really depends on what you want to do
[positive]	[12:24]	<eth01>	morning :)
[negative]	[12:25]	<mademelaugh>	neeto, yep

[negative]	[12:53]	<harveyd>	how do you enable modules in apache installed in ubuntu?
[negative]	[12:53]	<iKernel>	usernamed I doubt you'll have much luck with usb wireless, I'd recccommend buying a dlink card with an atheros chipset
[neutral]	[12:54]	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: yep...but i found a thread at forums
[positive]	[12:54]	<harveyd>	i remember it had a funny command line helped, but cant find / remember the name
[negative]	[12:54]	<LainIwakura>	mademelaugh: i'm not booted in ubuntu now.. will ifconfig, iwconfig, lshw -C network, lspci, or lsmod suffice (those of which I have written down)
[neutral]	[12:54]	<ere4si>	NekoKun: the mini iso is the net install  - most apps are d/loaded
[neutral]	[12:54]	<HardyOne>	harveyd: restart apache after you add the modules to your .conf
[neutral]	[12:54]	<iKernel>	usernamed anything with an atheros chipset will do actually, best to get one that goes into PCI port

[negative]	[12:54]	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: lol ok
[neutral]	[12:54]	<NekoKun>	ere4si: But I need some basic drivers... even to the wireless...
[negative]	[12:54]	<usernamed>	the case is such that the graphics card coolling hangs over the one remaining pci slot, no pci expansion possible :(
[negative]	[12:54]	<snask>	xhamahx, what soundcard do you got?
[negative]	[12:54]	<iKernel>	usernamed and I know the nature of new linux users, they will fight trying to make their current hardware work instead of buying something else. but the better option is to go out and buy something else
[neutral]	[12:54]	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: i will check
[negative]	[12:54]	<plagerism>	Is there anyway to automatically set the execute bit on oridinary files ala umask or any other means?

[positive]	[12:55]	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: works

[negative]	[12:55]	<harveyd>	thats it, thanks
[positive]	[12:55]	<plagerism>	crashanddie: ala umask, as in automatically upon creation
[neutral]	[12:56]	<ifireball>	harveyd: a2enmod
[negative]	[12:56]	<crashanddie>	plagerism, no, why would you need it ?
[negative]	[12:56]	<iKernel>	usernamed probably, but the belkin usb is very crap anyway, and drops out frequently. I had to install the drivers on windows frequently whenever it stopped working
[neutral]	[12:56]	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: This is the standard flash plugin yes? As in adobes?
[positive]	[12:56]	<iKernel>	usernamed, so even if you can  get it working, it will probably not be worth it
[negative]	[12:56]	<ere4si>	Ravenkin: you can but alot of extras will be d/loaded to make it work

[negative]	[12:57]	<crashanddie>	plagerism, only the program that creates the file can set given bits on it, the samba server allows you to set execute bits, but you need to go through it
[negative]	[12:57]	<ifireball>	HardyOne: yeah, but you don't need to actually tweak the conf file since the apache2 config is modular, you have symlink directories a-la /etc/rc*.d
[negative]	[12:57]	<Batch>	#ubuntu - I installed the correct drivers using ndisgtk, It said there WAS hardware for it so i don't see why the light should stay orange. I also modprobed.
[neutral]	[12:57]	<iKernel>	ToM-X what?
[positive]	[12:57]	<Glas`Awyr>	"I am in the Add/Remove Applications window. I can see xChat. I click it, and it tells me ""The list of applications is not available"""
[negative]	[12:57]	<usernamed>	iKernel, thanks for the advice.  All, if anyone knows of a usb solution that works out of the box with Ubuntu I'd greatly appreciate it.
[positive]	[12:57]	<HardyOne>	ifireball: my answer was very general I realise. but he got the jist I think

[neutral]	[13:01]	<iKernel>	for hardy
[positive]	[13:02]	<gord>	mohamed_: i just had a thought, wget shouldn't over write the old file by default, (as long as size+filename+datestamps are the same) so you could try wget -c }differentserver/filename{ again and see what happens, but copy the file somewhere first to maske sure. I wasnt thinking straight, i assumed at first you had used something horrible like windozeIE do download it, wget is very good, i think it will just work, starting at the offset fro

[positive]	[13:02]	<crashanddie>	gord, wget will not resume by default, but create a different file
[negative]	[13:02]	<iKernel>	nxusr no but personally, I wouldn't use any card that requires ndiswrapper. Find a card with an atheros chipset
[negative]	[13:02]	<ToM-X>	iKernel: No, I only see Madwifi Tools.
[negative]	[13:03]	<Ravenkin>	Anyone know of a front end for Cron?
[neutral]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	iKar, lspci -v
[negative]	[13:03]	<nxusr>	iKernel, not much of a choice, came with the notebook
[negative]	[13:03]	<iKernel>	ToM-X, right, install madwifi tools, and tell me if it selects any other packages due to dependicies
[negative]	[13:03]	<MadJawa>	I can't update some sources

[negative]	[13:04]	<iKernel>	ToM-X right, let me google around for a moment
[positive]	[13:04]	<ToM-X>	Thanks.
[negative]	[13:05]	<jtravnick>	MadJawa, what sources are you having problems with?
[neutral]	[13:05]	<crashanddie>	gord, it will rewrite or simply refuse to download, depending on the situation (timestamp, etc)
[neutral]	[13:05]	<iKernel>	ToM-X search for linux-restricted-modules
[neutral]	[13:05]	<gord>	crashanddie: he's already using wget -c    u suu, to continue it, its the change of server address he was worrying about
[positive]	[13:05]	<chazco>	Can someone confirm it is now possible to skip the 30th-boot fsck by pressing a key?
[negative]	[13:05]	<iKernel>	ToM-X oh, and open up a terminal and tell me the output of uname -r
[positive]	[13:05]	<crashanddie>	gord, it's the same filename, so -c will always resume
[positive]	[13:06]	<ere4si>	chazco: the escape key has always worked for me

[neutral]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, no, but I'm sure an error message will help us

[negative]	[13:06]	<iKernel>	ToM-X did any packages come up?
[neutral]	[13:06]	<mademelaugh>	DracoZA, i think you need to edit /etc/sudoers
[neutral]	[13:06]	<dredhammer>	anyone know how to enable the nvidia closed drivers for hardy in the latest kernel?
[neutral]	[13:07]	<ifireball>	bXi: quite a few of then, Ubuntu FF for example supports installing plugins/extensions from *.deb files

[negative]	[13:09]	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, I remember being unable to sudo once, after changing the hostname, try rebooting, if doesn't work, you're going have to boot from another medium, mount partition, and find out what happened
[negative]	[13:09]	<iKernel>	wib, are you running any other programs?
[negative]	[13:09]	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, but without more information, nor anything you did, we won't be able to help, sorry

[negative]	[13:11]	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, can you 'cat /etc/hostname' and tell me what it says ?
[negative]	[13:11]	<iKernel>	gilster32 should just be able to stick the dvd-ram stick in and go cdrecord blah.iso

[neutral]	[13:11]	<gilster32>	ikernel: no
[neutral]	[13:11]	<iKernel>	gilster32 you'll need soemthing to create the iso file though
[negative]	[13:11]	<jtravnick>	MadJawa, you sure thats a valid source? also if you did an upgrade make sure your third party sources say hardy and not gutsy
[negative]	[13:11]	<iKernel>	"gilster32 what do you mean, ""no""?"

[negative]	[13:13]	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: im runnig an ibm t30 notebook with the new ubuntu 8.04 and the avm wlan usb stick
[neutral]	[13:13]	<iKernel>	swamy first change your apt.sources file to the hardy sources, then run apt-get update, then run apt-get dist-upgrade
[neutral]	[13:13]	<DracoZA>	"crashanddie, it says ""Thumper"" which is the name of the machine"

[negative]	[13:13]	<crashanddie>	newcomer008, I don't know all the drivers by heart, can you try to find out ? Or at least give me the chipset name of your usb wifi dongle
[positive]	[13:14]	<MadJawa>	jtravnick: it seems that the french servers are a bit laggy at this time
[negative]	[13:14]	<iKernel>	ToM-X ok, looks like you've already got linux-restricted installed, have you been into the restricted drivers manager yet?
[negative]	[13:14]	<mouseclon1>	I joined 8.04 to AD.  Now I'm unable to sudo anything.  Any ideas?
[negative]	[13:14]	<MadJawa>	I think I should wait
[positive]	[13:14]	<ere4si>	NekoKun: it is all about getting the necessaries from the net - so it uses minimal resources
[neutral]	[13:14]	<newcomer008>	crashanddie: ill try out to find find out what driver it exactly is
[negative]	[13:14]	<iKernel>	gilster32 yes I am, it is used in cam corder and can be repetadly written to without having to blank the disk
[negative]	[13:14]	<swamy>	iKernel: i did aptitude update and then aptitude full-upgrade, but links are not avalaible

[negative]	[13:14]	<ifireball>	bXi: not sure how trustworthy is firebug here, I'd try to sniff the communications, but that may be a rather radical approach, do you get any errors in the JS console?
[neutral]	[13:14]	<crashanddie>	DracoZA, hang on, what command are you executing with sudo ?

[negative]	[13:15]	<mouseclon1>	or could someone point me in a direction to get sudo working with AD?
[positive]	[13:15]	<bXi>	ifireball: everything is fine otherwise just that it doesnt show.. weirdest is that firefox 2.0.0.14 in windows works and an older firefox on a custom linux distro also works
[negative]	[13:15]	<intrinsyx>	Howdy folks. I have a laptop, and I just did a full wipe and reinstall of hardy from scratch. I used to have a little tray icon to set my CPU speed, but I can't remember the package name to reinstall it. Would anyone happen to know?

[neutral]	[13:15]	<ifireball>	bXi: could your Ubuntu FF contain other plug-ins that may be in the way?  noscript, etc. ?

[positive]	[13:42]	<intrinsyx>	Latest Xorg is a PITA with monitor resolutions -- it will disable valid modes that used to work. Check your xorg.conf
[positive]	[13:42]	<v0lksman>	roocraig:  then hit reload and close Synaptic...then run update manager again
[neutral]	[13:42]	<NeT_DeMoN>	amerio: ok, thanks

[negative]	[13:44]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  yeah...just make sure you select the OLD packages and not the current....each will have a meta package that will remove the headers and stuff iirc...

[negative]	[13:45]	<erik__>	v0lksman: should i check anywhere else?
[negative]	[13:45]	<halcyonCorsair>	emorris: yes but if you use the whole disk, does it partition it and split some off for swap, or what?

[negative]	[13:53]	<BrianB04>	Morning all: I have an oddball issue with Ubuntu. This morning I went to play a Quicktime movie. It popped up, asked if I wanted to find the right codec, it found two and I installed the FFMPEG codecs. Now, whenever I go to open another quicktime movie, it again pops up the request to search for a codec because 'The codec to play this movie is not installed'. Anyway to stop that.
[negative]	[13:53]	<Fome>	intrinsyx: there is no package with that name

[neutral]	[13:55]	<N1NCHN41L5>	NO you way of just install and go DOESNT work - it chewed up ubuntu grub and its own grub wouldnt load

[negative]	[13:56]	<iKernel>	erik__, unless you're running a big music recording station, which you should probably use a mac anyway, in that case, you should probably run pulseaudio as well or something

[neutral]	[13:56]	<v0lksman>	?

[positive]	[13:56]	<mheath>	erik__: um, yeah...what everyone else is saying is true. oss is very similar to ALSA, but inferior, and has been obsolete (due to ALSA) for about 6 years. Don't use that. :-)
[negative]	[13:56]	<erik__>	do i need to restart anything to make vlc use alsa?
[negative]	[13:56]	<amerio>	iKernel how to remove ndiswrapper from modprobe?

[negative]	[13:57]	<Fome>	intrinsyx: they are installed... I'm not sure I understand how to continue...
[negative]	[13:57]	<mheath>	erik__: Your system doesn't even really support oss anymore, anyway...all that would be doing is ALSA simulating the old oss.
[negative]	[13:57]	<iKernel>	amerio, modprobe -r <module you want to boot up the ass and get out for just a moment while you do something else>
[neutral]	[13:57]	<intrinsyx>	N1NCHN41L5: then reinstall ubuntu's grub. fire up the livecd, open up terminal, run sudo grub, and from the grub prompt, find /boot/grub/stage1, it'll return the device it found it on, root <device>, setup <device>
[neutral]	[13:57]	<slytherin>	erik__: restart vlc perhaps
[negative]	[13:57]	<arvind_khadri>	artti, use somewhere around 4x or so to be safe

[negative]	[13:59]	<slytherin>	sailaway85: is that a single problem or multiple problems? Can you please rephrase your question?
[neutral]	[13:59]	<iKernel>	dooglus, ctrl+alt+backspace
[negative]	[13:59]	<arvind_khadri>	sailaway85, that would needed to be looked in strace
[negative]	[13:59]	<dooglus>	iKernel: I want to log out of GNOME, not kill X.  any idea?
[neutral]	[13:59]	<artti>	dragon_, Digidata CD-R

[negative]	[13:59]	<dooglus>	iKernel: I can click the little green man thing, but I can't see the dialog that pops up
[negative]	[13:59]	<slytherin>	dooglus: Ctrl + Alt + Delete should bring logout/shutdown dialog
[negative]	[13:59]	<mattycoze>	hey while i'm here, is there any way to get rid of that annoyign error beep
[negative]	[13:59]	<erik__>	slytherin: no, that was the problem. thanks!
[neutral]	[13:59]	<iKernel>	dooglus, set a log out keyboard shortcut
[negative]	[13:59]	<dooglus>	slytherin: yes, I'm sure it does, but I can't see it
[negative]	[13:59]	<Fome>	intrinsyx: sorry, for being stupid, but there is no obvious place to set the default card. (after I click the thing there is a list of different options)
[neutral]	[13:59]	<amerio>	Net_Demon anything new?
[neutral]	[13:59]	<dooglus>	iKernel: how?
[positive]	[13:59]	<dagon_>	artti; tip: use tab :) it's dagon_, burn on TDK or Fujifilm, works perfect
[neutral]	[13:59]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, ctrl+alt+del
[neutral]	[14:00]	<erik__>	slytherin: i thought it was grabbing the default one from gnome
[neutral]	[14:00]	<iKernel>	dooglus, on mine it is system->preferences->keyboard shortcuts

[positive]	[14:00]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, use the log out thats it :)
[negative]	[14:00]	<Koheleth>	I installed the 32bit because I did not like the 64bit, now I have them both!  How do I get rid of the 64bit installation?
[negative]	[14:00]	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: I can't see it. can I use the keyboard to navigate that dialog?
[negative]	[14:00]	<Fome>	intrinsyx: but then I don't know how to continue
[negative]	[14:00]	<mattycoze>	oh thnk christ i fixed that
[neutral]	[14:00]	<intrinsyx>	Fome: select Volume Control, Output devices tab, look for a little sheild
[positive]	[14:01]	<slytherin>	sailaway85: for video converting you will have to log a bug against the package you are using. But I haven't seen the one where FF crashes when 3d is unabled
[negative]	[14:01]	<iKernel>	dooglus, you'll need a mouse in order to set the keyboard short cut, btw
[negative]	[14:01]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, try using tab in that box not sure whether it'll work or not

[negative]	[14:01]	<iKernel>	dooglus, then use it and set a keyboard short cut

[negative]	[14:01]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, what exactly is your problem

[negative]	[14:02]	<intrinsyx>	Fome: or if you want output from both cards, click the plug, configure local sound server, simultaneous output tab, checkmark the box.
[neutral]	[14:02]	<NeT_DeMoN>	amerio: no but im giving up
[neutral]	[14:02]	<slytherin>	dooglus: you can simple use Alt + L to activate the logout button
[negative]	[14:02]	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: I want to log out.  the dialog that appears when I try to log out is in the middle of the screen.  the middle of the screen is all dead pixels, so I can't see it, and I can't move it elsewhere.  I think I need to use the keyboard
[negative]	[14:02]	<NeT_DeMoN>	i will just stick to hardwire or vista :(
[neutral]	[14:02]	<moDumassest>	!audio
[negative]	[14:02]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[negative]	[14:07]	<slytherin>	albech: still it would be good to verify the checksum of image.
[neutral]	[14:07]	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: what driver you have?
[positive]	[14:07]	<cgentry72>	mysling, i've got 64bit also and it worked fine yesterday
[negative]	[14:07]	<mattk>	artti i'm not running 64 bit.... I've got the same deal as cgentry72 plays for a couple of seconds and then you lose the lot... also there is no sound at all
[positive]	[14:07]	<artti>	arvind_khadri, done that several times and it is said that it won't work on 64-bit system.
[negative]	[14:07]	<nickthorley>	net_demon: not sure - my card is intel one and used a restricted driver before
[positive]	[14:07]	<arvind_khadri>	artti, its works for me
[neutral]	[14:08]	<fdr>	hi! what's the best way to edit partitions with a GUI? gparted?
[neutral]	[14:08]	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: @HLINK
[negative]	[14:08]	<mysling>	artti: tried 8.04?
[negative]	[14:08]	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  why are you telling artti to use specific brands and slow down his burn?
[positive]	[14:08]	<ere4si>	cgentry72: My only thought ...
[neutral]	[14:08]	<dagon_>	v0lksman; speaking out of experience
[neutral]	[14:08]	<bhsx>	or just use the mount command for loopback
[neutral]	[14:08]	<slytherin>	fdr: yes
[neutral]	[14:08]	<artti>	mysling, burning 8.04 image on disk
[positive]	[14:08]	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: atheros is worse, trust me ;)
[neutral]	[14:08]	<dagon_>	v0lksman; -out of + from
[neutral]	[14:08]	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  issues like that are completely drive specific...
[neutral]	[14:08]	<N1NCHN41L5>	arti - or just do sudo aptitue ubuntu-restricted-extras, gives u everything
[positive]	[14:08]	<dagon_>	v0lksman; not always
[positive]	[14:08]	<mysling>	artti: im sure you will have no problems with it :D
[negative]	[14:09]	<sailaway85>	slytherin: also have divx web plugin ... going to remove.... could it be a memory overlap or leak?
[positive]	[14:09]	<timo>	hey all hardy rocks :)
[negative]	[14:09]	<slytherin>	sailaway85: form where did you get the divx plugin?
[negative]	[14:09]	<arvind_khadri>	artti, hey ok i guess there was a bug for that,but that was in 7.10 maybe the tweak can work for you
[negative]	[14:09]	<nickthorley>	net_demon: i think the wireless support is very bad in linux general - it always seems to be the problem area - I wouldnt mind but i would have thought intel chipset would work perfectly but it seems not
[neutral]	[14:09]	<N1NCHN41L5>	GPARTED works GREAT - just make sure what u are trying do do (drive) isnt mounted
[negative]	[14:09]	<erik__>	any news on unlock button not working?
[negative]	[14:09]	<LainIwakura>	"Hello, I just changed my openssh config, but when  I try to restart it via ""sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart"" it says not such file or directory. How do I restart OpenSSH then? Thanks."
[neutral]	[14:09]	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: there's also a GUI for it called gnomeiso
[negative]	[14:09]	<v0lksman>	dagon_:  uhm...ok...I build machines for a living...I use cheap generic CDs on usually generic drives and haven't had issues for years....
[neutral]	[14:09]	<pallavi>	Hi
[neutral]	[14:09]	<artti>	Again, it is just copied .iso file to disk.
[negative]	[14:09]	<ha|0>	hello, I'm having trouble writing to a particular partition, but with only one program.  I have to run it as root for it to work.  Any thoughts?
[neutral]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, hi
[negative]	[14:10]	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: yeah, linux does suck with wireless
[negative]	[14:10]	<moDumassest>	daft punk sounds really scratchy, i cant seem to fix this, has anyone had sound issues thus far?
[positive]	[14:10]	<jerzyk86>	thx :)
[neutral]	[14:10]	<pallavi>	I am new to ubuntu
[positive]	[14:10]	<ToM-X1>	Right, I'm back with my crappy WIFI problem :P
[negative]	[14:10]	<dagon_>	v0lksman; that's good, really. But I've had bad experience with lowprice cd's, no matter what burner I've used
[neutral]	[14:10]	<bazhang>	moDumassest: what is that
[neutral]	[14:10]	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: actually, it's called gmountiso
[neutral]	[14:10]	<albech>	v0lksman: i have had experiences with disks too, where it helped to slow down the burn speed
[negative]	[14:10]	<pallavi>	can u please tell me how to login as a root user
[neutral]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, do you have a support question
[positive]	[14:10]	<moDumassest>	music is really scratchy
[negative]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, why do you want to do that
[negative]	[14:10]	<cgentry72>	i'm removing anything that has to do with firefox and then reinstalling flash
[negative]	[14:10]	<moDumassest>	using alsa, have googled it no one knows
[negative]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	!root
[negative]	[14:10]	<ubotu>	Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at @HLINK
[neutral]	[14:10]	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: 'sudo apt-get install gmountiso'
[neutral]	[14:10]	<slytherin>	!tell pallavi about sudo
[neutral]	[14:10]	<N1NCHN41L5>	pallavi SUDO
[negative]	[14:10]	<sailaway85>	slytherin: Actually I'm not sure... I think it came from firefox?
[neutral]	[14:10]	<IntangibleLiquid>	if a wifi network appears in the nm-applet, does it mean that my wifi work? My wifi LED lights up during boot time then dims, is this a problem?
[neutral]	[14:11]	<arvind_khadri>	!sudo | pallavi
[positive]	[14:11]	<ubotu>	"pallavi: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges (""root""). Look at @HLINK for more information."
[negative]	[14:11]	<nickthorley>	net_demon: i used to use fedora but when got a laptop it wouldnt work with wireless and thus tried ubuntu which worked first time so was really happy but then new version of ubuntu comes out and no support  - great
[negative]	[14:11]	<albech>	v0lksman: cant say anything about disks since they are mostly produced on the same factories, just added different logos
[negative]	[14:11]	<pallavi>	because when i am trying to copy folders it is saying operation not permitted
[negative]	[14:11]	<v0lksman>	albech:  I'm not saying you WON'T have issues...but since we don't know what make/model artti has it seems silly to jump the gun and tell him to slow it down and buy new CDs
[neutral]	[14:11]	<moDumassest>	!alsa
[negative]	[14:11]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[neutral]	[14:11]	<N1NCHN41L5>	sudo apt-get install program
[negative]	[14:11]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: are you sure OpenSSH is installed? /etc/init.d/ssh should be there
[neutral]	[14:11]	<crashanddie>	IntangibleLiquid, it usually means you're on the good way
[neutral]	[14:11]	<erik__>	!unlock
[negative]	[14:11]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about unlock - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[14:11]	<N1NCHN41L5>	or sudo aptitude install program
[negative]	[14:11]	<ToM_x>	Ah, iKernel has gone -_-
[negative]	[14:11]	<bhsx>	IntangibleLiquid: yes, it should be working if there's a wireless network in nm-applet
[negative]	[14:11]	<cgentry72>	no luck with that
[neutral]	[14:11]	<NeT_DeMoN>	nickthorley: its always worked for my intels, just atheros is the first problem ive had
[neutral]	[14:11]	<spiniker>	hello
[neutral]	[14:11]	<spiniker>	room
[negative]	[14:11]	<pallavi>	ya i can login as root in a terminal
[negative]	[14:11]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi you cant copy paste into root folder
[negative]	[14:12]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, it didn't remove my linux-headers...
[neutral]	[14:12]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, i meant in X
[negative]	[14:12]	<spiniker>	i just upgraded to the new 8.04,but i cant seem to get my emerald themes to work..
[neutral]	[14:12]	<LainIwakura>	ifireball: I only need openssh-client, right?
[negative]	[14:12]	<spiniker>	any ideas?
[negative]	[14:12]	<pallavi>	i am not pasteing into root folder
[negative]	[14:12]	<brackettt>	hello, upgraded ubuntu yesterday, now it wont make it past the login screen anything i can do?
[negative]	[14:12]	<v0lksman>	dagon_ albech:  All I'm saying is the best way to know is to try burning at full speed on the disks you have...If that doesn't work then try slowing it down...if that fails then maybe look at new media...
[negative]	[14:12]	<ha|0>	hello, I'm having trouble writing to a particular partition, but with only one program.  I have to run it as root for it to work.  Any thoughts?
[positive]	[14:12]	<timo>	I like you the way you tube works in totem :)
[negative]	[14:12]	<pallavi>	i am copying from the root thats all
[positive]	[14:12]	<slytherin>	sailaway85: Can you tell me what is the Filename for divx plugin? You can type about:plugins in the address location of firefox
[neutral]	[14:12]	<albech>	v0lksman: i totally agree with that
[negative]	[14:12]	<IntangibleLiquid>	<bhsx> <crashanddie>: thanks, I just cannot test it because the wifi is encrypted, but I did attempt to connect to a free wifi this afternoon without success. How can I activate the LED? My function key does not work for wifi
[neutral]	[14:12]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, to where
[negative]	[14:13]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  what package did you end up removing?
[negative]	[14:13]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: depends on what you are trying to do, /etc/init.d/ssh restarts the server...
[neutral]	[14:13]	<T4NK3R>	lol
[neutral]	[14:13]	<Heroin>	Ruben?
[positive]	[14:13]	<T4NK3R>	ben er eindelijk:)
[negative]	[14:13]	<slytherin>	pallavi: it depends on what you are trying to access. Not everything in root folder has read access to everyone
[neutral]	[14:13]	<arthur>	Hi
[neutral]	[14:13]	<pallavi>	ya
[neutral]	[14:13]	<bhsx>	slytherin: 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras'
[neutral]	[14:13]	<T4NK3R>	hi
[positive]	[14:13]	<albech>	v0lksman: but slowing down the burn is not a bad suggestion, and it definitely wont cause more failures ;)
[neutral]	[14:13]	<ari_stress>	hi guys, just installed hardy. but i cannot install build-essential, has anyone experience the same?
[positive]	[14:13]	<artti>	I hope that Ubuntu 8.04(32-bit) works fine on AMD64.
[neutral]	[14:13]	<crashanddie>	IntangibleLiquid, check your syslog to see if you have any changes when using the function key
[negative]	[14:13]	<pallavi>	sorry i made a mistake
[neutral]	[14:13]	<skyowner>	hi
[neutral]	[14:13]	<N1NCHN41L5>	sudo aptitude install is easier
[negative]	[14:13]	<pallavi>	what i am trying to say is
[positive]	[14:13]	<v0lksman>	artti:  it does.... :)
[negative]	[14:14]	<LainIwakura>	"ifireball: Well, I added ""ServerAliveInterval 120"" to ssh_config, so I thought I needed to restart it so the changes will go into effect. But there is no ssh restart..."
[positive]	[14:14]	<skyowner>	i don't understand one thing, is UBUNTU 8.04 compatible with standart French Packages
[neutral]	[14:14]	<skyowner>	?
[neutral]	[14:14]	<arvind_khadri>	ari_stress, put in the cd and install build-essential
[negative]	[14:14]	<titan_>	I updated to hardy herron today but when it restarted it just gives me a load of text for an hour then hangs, i had to put the 7.10 live cd back in
[positive]	[14:14]	<v0lksman>	albech:  not when you are eager to get going and you have to wait 45 minutes for a burn... :)
[negative]	[14:14]	<LainIwakura>	ifireball: I am not running a ssh server on this computer, so I don't think I need  openssh-server
[negative]	[14:14]	<brackettt>	im running ubuntu in safemode and it could run HAL what does that mean?
[neutral]	[14:14]	<bhsx>	slytherin: or you can add medibuntu to you apt sources and 'sudo apt-get install w32codecs'
[negative]	[14:14]	<pallavi>	I am not touching the root contents
[negative]	[14:14]	<erik__>	"anyone exccept for me having problems with policykit and ""unlock"" button in system prefs after upgrade?"

[neutral]	[14:14]	<timo>	﻿ brackettt: hi
[neutral]	[14:14]	<bhsx>	you asked for the divx package name...

[negative]	[14:14]	<phixxor>	hey, does anyone know for sure how the heron image is lisensed?
[negative]	[14:14]	<nickthorley>	is there an address i can browse the ubuntu updates area - browse the files etc so that I can view a list - like browsing the ftp area for them for instance
[neutral]	[14:15]	<arthur>	What is actually the easiest way to use java (in firefox) with ubuntu 8.04 amd64?
[negative]	[14:15]	<slytherin>	bhsx: No, I am trying to debug the problem another user is facing.
[negative]	[14:15]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: like the name implies, ServerAliveInterval is a server configuration directive, you should be placing it on the server...
[negative]	[14:15]	<v0lksman>	erik__:  did you try re-installing policykit and policykit-gnome?
[negative]	[14:15]	<bhsx>	ah
[neutral]	[14:15]	<IntangibleLiquid>	crashanddie: thanks! I'll do that
[negative]	[14:15]	<pallavi>	only what i want to do is i want to copy the dir which contains c files
[negative]	[14:15]	<erik__>	v0lksman: nope.. i'll try that now i guess
[positive]	[14:15]	<bullgard4>	What is the command-line command to download the source code of a DEB program package?
[negative]	[14:15]	<slytherin>	pallavi: Which file are you trying to access?
[neutral]	[14:15]	<v0lksman>	albech:  zaclty...hahahah
[neutral]	[14:15]	<pallavi>	which is in home folder
[neutral]	[14:15]	<LainIwakura>	ifireball: Okay, thanks.
[neutral]	[14:15]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley : maybe packages.ubuntu.com is what you are looking for?
[positive]	[14:15]	<brackettt>	timo yeah yesterday. actually restarted the comp today. and now i can only log in with safe more
[neutral]	[14:15]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, to whre??

[positive]	[14:16]	<artti>	arthur, like installing?
[neutral]	[14:16]	<slytherin>	sailaway85: can you post any screenshot?
[neutral]	[14:16]	<cgentry72>	for those having issues with flash and firefox, i suggest removing all plugins for firefox and removing flash, then reinstall flash and reboot.  that worked for me
[negative]	[14:16]	<erik__>	i have to remove them and install them? or is there a reinstall flag?
[negative]	[14:16]	<arthur>	@ artti yeah but which package?

[negative]	[14:18]	<Al00>	*sigh* -- did a network upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 yesterday. Now, if I press any key on my numeric keypad (microsoft wireless keybaord) -- I get booted out of my session.
[positive]	[14:18]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: however, I think its a better practive to make client-side changes in your own home directory e.g. in the ~/.ssh/config file
[neutral]	[14:18]	<Al00>	Anyone else having this issue?
[positive]	[14:18]	<LainIwakura>	"ifireball: So restarting ssh is only applicable if I'm running a server.. and the changes I made to ssh_config will take effect once I run a ""ssh"" command? Thanks."

[neutral]	[14:19]	<slytherin>	arthur: which java version do you wich to use, the plugin package depends on that

[neutral]	[14:21]	<v0lksman>	afallenhope:  wyssat?
[negative]	[14:21]	<bazhang>	sanozuke: perhaps gedit--just like it is only in windows though

[negative]	[14:21]	<ndy>	hi, anybody with a thinkpad r61 c2d8100, nvida nvs 140) around? and/or any idea why kubuntu live-cd is booting but ubuntu is hanging after starting the live-cd (does not boot hangs on bootscreen where you can choose if you want to install or try)
[negative]	[14:21]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  have you tried envyng?  its in the universal repos
[positive]	[14:21]	<sanozuke>	thank you
[positive]	[14:21]	<CTankred>	Hi guys, does the new screen resolution tool works for you? Doesn't detect any sec. monitors here
[negative]	[14:21]	<slytherin>	arthur: icedtea packages lack some classes like sound. So may not work with every applet
[neutral]	[14:21]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, did that work??
[negative]	[14:21]	<slytherin>	﻿Itaku: it is not necessary it will work. if it was made for oracle you need oracle installation on your machine.
[neutral]	[14:21]	<v0lksman>	erik__:  @HLINK
[negative]	[14:21]	<arthur>	@ slytherin: ok I will see... thank you!
[positive]	[14:21]	<bhsx>	slytherin: icedtea sound works great over here
[negative]	[14:22]	<bazhang>	ndy sounds like a bad burn or a corrupt iso
[negative]	[14:22]	<Heroin>	Whats up with the Encrypt stuff in gnome?
[positive]	[14:22]	<sanozuke>	thanks
[negative]	[14:22]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, the problem is that at a kernel update it will break the module and the laptop won't have graphics ....and that is VERY problematic
[negative]	[14:22]	<nickthorley>	gord_: well i cant get a wilress connection in 7.10 it came up asking if I would like to use a restricted driver which worked perfectly but in 8.04 this seems to have been removed for some strange reason - It may be available in a patched kernel or via other patches but I dont know this unless I install I guess
[negative]	[14:22]	<Itaku>	uh ive seen this in my terminal for the past 5 mins. 0% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.88.31)]
[negative]	[14:22]	<f0rmat>	can someone tell me how to set the system so every time i add a user by default they can only access ~
[positive]	[14:22]	<ndy>	bazhang: burned the ubuntu cd two times .. will try another one :)
[negative]	[14:22]	<slytherin>	bhsx: no, you are certainly using something other than icedtea. Check 'java -version'
[negative]	[14:22]	<bhsx>	Itaku: it's because the servers are getting SLAMMED
[negative]	[14:22]	<sailaway85>	slytherin: removed divx plugin ... running tovin now without system rebooting
[negative]	[14:22]	<bhsx>	just let it run
[negative]	[14:22]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley : What type of wireless card do you have? Belkin, D-Link etc
[neutral]	[14:22]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  with envy or just when you install manually?
[neutral]	[14:22]	<slytherin>	Heroin: what with that?
[negative]	[14:23]	<Itaku>	well crap
[neutral]	[14:23]	<Heroin>	slytherin: the encryption option in gnome.. in the filemanager
[neutral]	[14:23]	<Itaku>	ill try to find another place to download phpmyadmin
[negative]	[14:23]	<pallavi>	i tried it is copied
[neutral]	[14:23]	<nickthorley>	voxxi: i have an intel 3945 abg card
[negative]	[14:23]	<pallavi>	but i am not able to view the contents in it
[positive]	[14:23]	<loder>	can I ask are many people trying the lazy way of upgrading to Heron or are you all being sensible and backing up and starting fresh. i always used to do a fresh install as awindows user, but I'm told aptitude especially does avery good job?
[negative]	[14:23]	<gord_>	 nickthorley : ah ok got u now, yep use the live CD to install a system, THEN solve the wireless probem, do u have a a wireD network connection on the machine?
[neutral]	[14:23]	<slytherin>	Heroin: ever heard of gnupg?
[neutral]	[14:23]	<bazhang>	nickthorley that card not working?
[positive]	[14:23]	<modoc>	once again ubuntu has given my hard drives names I can't find.
[negative]	[14:23]	<modoc>	How can I list the known drives on the machine?
[negative]	[14:24]	<len>	after updating to 8.04 my gnome-rdp gives this error: Error during the connection to database, uninstalling and installing the package dit not help
[negative]	[14:24]	<arthur>	@ loder yeah no need to starting fresh ... I have done both ways several times and had no problems
[neutral]	[14:24]	<ifireball>	modoc: sudo fdisk -l
[neutral]	[14:24]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, before the update i had envy and now i want to install it the ubuntu way so it doesn't break during the kernel updates
[neutral]	[14:24]	<v0lksman>	!uuid > modoc
[positive]	[14:24]	<bazhang>	loder well not really lazy; just like to continue on--your way is fine too though
[neutral]	[14:24]	<bhsx>	i installed icedtea-gcjwebplugin, which installed openjdk --jre
[neutral]	[14:24]	<immesys>	!uuid > me
[neutral]	[14:24]	<bhsx>	openjdk-6-jre, that is
[neutral]	[14:24]	<nickthorley>	gord_: yes I do.  how can i install patches and test though when the patches may need a reboot?
[neutral]	[14:24]	<bullium>	modoc: sudo fdisk -l
[neutral]	[14:24]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: no it doesnt
[negative]	[14:24]	<bullium>	ifireball: sorry
[positive]	[14:24]	<modoc>	ifireball, bullium, v0lksman: thanks!
[neutral]	[14:24]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  ahh...I think Alberto fixed that with EnvyNG...
[negative]	[14:25]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: what does ifconfig show
[negative]	[14:25]	<bullium>	modoc: yep
[negative]	[14:25]	<jojomas>	so, funny thing happened partition editor doesn't detect my partitions, but i can see them from nautilus. je, I can't get past the LiveCD
[negative]	[14:25]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley : Apparently, according to the linux wireless list, its fully supported. What have you tried to get it working
[neutral]	[14:25]	<N1NCHN41L5>	"Anyone Know How to DUAL BOOT Multiple Linux OS""S??????"
[negative]	[14:25]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: unfortunately cant tell you as not with the machine at the moment
[neutral]	[14:25]	<slytherin>	bhsx: yes, that is different from icedtea-java-7 packages. But even openjdk is not complete AFAIK,
[neutral]	[14:25]	<sanozuke>	whooo
[negative]	[14:25]	<loder>	bazhang i am thinking of doing that actually - Gutsy does everytihng I need and I actually rely on it as my main system now so I loathe to mess with awinning formula
[neutral]	[14:25]	<arstanj>	hi all, is the ubuntu repos lagging? does anybody experiencing this?
[neutral]	[14:25]	<slytherin>	N1NCHN41L5: grub installation wil take care of it
[positive]	[14:25]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  may want to check with him in the forums though....Envy has been flawless for me with ATI in the past and so far with NG and nVidia it's been ok...but no kernel updates yet... ;)
[negative]	[14:25]	<mattycoze>	hey how do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[negative]	[14:25]	<nickthorley>	voxxi: i havent tried anything - it was autodetected before and I cant see why the driver should have been removed from a later version of the os - seems like a backward step to me
[neutral]	[14:25]	<pallavi>	Hi
[neutral]	[14:26]	<artenius>	N1NCHN41L5: grub
[neutral]	[14:26]	<immesys>	arstanj: all ubuntu sites are lagging
[negative]	[14:26]	<afallenhope>	anyone know how I can completely restore Ubuntu? I don't know the partitions.. I just did the desktop installation. I want to reinstall. I jacked up all my modules some how.
[positive]	[14:26]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I have the exact same card and it works very well once you get it going--when you have a chance perhpas you can troubleshhot it
[negative]	[14:26]	<gord_>	 nickthorley : ah, i meant actually INTALL the system onto hard disk using the live CD, but do u just want to test it witout disturbing the hard disk? not easy at all that way....
[neutral]	[14:26]	<Sajuukkhar>	same here
[negative]	[14:26]	<JPSmon>	what would happen if I ran wubi with wine???
[positive]	[14:26]	<N1NCHN41L5>	artenius - GRUB is my only problem
[negative]	[14:26]	<Sajuukkhar>	i want to know what partitions i require to have
[negative]	[14:26]	<slytherin>	N1NCHN41L5: and please don't use all caps. It is considered as shouting.
[positive]	[14:26]	<arstanj>	immeys: thanks, so its not only my network
[negative]	[14:26]	<mattycoze>	How do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[negative]	[14:26]	<sanozuke>	how to you guys and girls read so fast
[negative]	[14:26]	<IndyGunFreak>	JPSmon: lol, i think it would create a comedy of errors
[neutral]	[14:26]	<Sajuukkhar>	we dont
[negative]	[14:26]	<bazhang>	loder well I would stick with gutsy until 804.1 if you know what I mean
[neutral]	[14:26]	<Heroin>	slytherin:  what is gnupg?
[negative]	[14:26]	<immesys>	sanozuke: you don't you just look for your name and the name of the person you're talking to
[negative]	[14:26]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, the problem is that i must finish the upgrade as soon as possible...so i don't know how long it'll take before having a response in the forums...
[neutral]	[14:27]	<evand>	JPSmon: ...it would work.
[neutral]	[14:27]	<arstanj>	immeys: I'm pretty much understand that ubuntu iso mirrors lags, but repos... esp they differ from country to country....
[neutral]	[14:27]	<JPSmon>	LOL, how?
[neutral]	[14:27]	<bazhang>	!tab | sanozuke
[negative]	[14:27]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley: Maybe it was detected correctly, but not configured properly. Does it show up under the System > Admin > Network?
[positive]	[14:27]	<ubotu>	sanozuke: You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[negative]	[14:27]	<nickthorley>	gord_: ok no prob - will just have to install and then if cant get it working revert back to 7.10
[negative]	[14:27]	<N1NCHN41L5>	was only partly caps so they know its not M$ dual boot - text moves so fast
[neutral]	[14:27]	<slytherin>	Heroin: it is implementation of public-key cryptography
[negative]	[14:27]	<IndyGunFreak>	evand: you really think so?.. i seriously doubt it would
[positive]	[14:27]	<jojomas>	well.. lets all do a fresh install of 7.10, and then upgrade to 8.04... this is feeling like windows man
[negative]	[14:27]	<bhsx>	slytherin: that's interesting.. i hadn't realized that.... i'm actually uninstalling and installing sun-java6-plugin to see if i can tell a difference on any applets
[negative]	[14:27]	<mattycoze>	How do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[neutral]	[14:27]	<JPSmon>	evand, would i dual boot my linux?
[negative]	[14:27]	<fysa>	is there a Wubi channel?
[neutral]	[14:27]	<bazhang>	jojomas: far from it
[neutral]	[14:27]	<pallavi>	Hi
[negative]	[14:27]	<jojomas>	jaja, just kidding
[neutral]	[14:27]	<fysa>	I boot into initramfs every time.
[neutral]	[14:27]	<slytherin>	pallavi: you may want to join #ubuntu-in. You have high chance of getting answers there
[neutral]	[14:28]	<ifireball>	mattycoze: try using it?
[positive]	[14:28]	<evand>	JPSmon: IndyGunFreak I've seen it with my own eyes.  The lead developer works in Ubuntu, it's kind of a necessity.  But it's only useful for testing that it created the right things and put them in the right place.
[positive]	[14:28]	<pallavi>	ya Thanks for assistance
[neutral]	[14:28]	<sanozuke>	you guys
[negative]	[14:28]	<gord_>	 nickthorley : yep but not too hard to install then configure stuff once it's on your disk, but near-impossibkle to remaster a live-cd that way for specific card u see
[neutral]	[14:28]	<dassouki>	when i do an lsb_release -a i get 8.04 hardy !
[negative]	[14:28]	<nickthorley>	"bazhang: what did you have to do to get it going - I think we need to get out of having to ""fix"" it - if it auto worked before then why not in a later version - I love linux and want to get more people into it but if the way to get your card working is to play with kernel modules then i cant help but thinking we are going backwards not forwards"
[negative]	[14:28]	<sanozuke>	are a lot of time online
[neutral]	[14:28]	<evand>	fysa: no, just a forum and website.
[negative]	[14:28]	<v0lksman>	"GNUtoo:  I'm not sure how installing the drivers manually is going to help though...no matter what when you install a new kernel you need to create the modules for it...Envy does it for you while the ""Ubuntu"" way (which isn't cause Ubuntu Way means no proprietary software) you have to do it by hand...."
[negative]	[14:28]	<halll0>	can anyone help with a permissions problem I'm having?
[negative]	[14:28]	<N1NCHN41L5>	yes /j #wubi - only 1 person in it now
[neutral]	[14:28]	<IndyGunFreak>	evand: well, i'd have to see that to believe it
[negative]	[14:28]	<ibleed>	how do i encrypt a partition that requires me to give a password when i want to access it (not on boot but manually) ?
[neutral]	[14:28]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: this is hardy right?
[neutral]	[14:28]	<loder>	IndyGunFreak it might even work though - that very last version of Wine is startlingly good - it even runs Dreamweaver with bit of tweaking now - that amazed me!
[negative]	[14:28]	<nickthorley>	gord_: no prob - thanks for your help - will install it tonight
[neutral]	[14:28]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: yes hardy
[negative]	[14:29]	<sanozuke>	how to i use tab to search for program
[negative]	[14:29]	<JPSmon>	evand: So there wouldnt be a dual boot then?
[negative]	[14:29]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  I honestly think EnvyNG will fix your upgrade issue though...the app is more closely integrated for Hardy then it was in the past...he worked with Ubuntu devs to make a lot happen...
[neutral]	[14:29]	<evand>	IndyGunFreak: bzr branch lp:wubi wubi; cd wubi; make prerequisites; make; make test
[negative]	[14:29]	<evand>	JPSmon: I'm not sure I understand your question.  Can you elaborate on what you want to accomplish?
[negative]	[14:29]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, what i mean by ubuntu way is trough the restricted hardware gui which install the nvidia module package wich would be updated if the kernel is updated
[negative]	[14:29]	<neeto>	How do I set the color depth in 8.04?
[positive]	[14:29]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: they moved from the ipw3945 to the iwl3945 and the transition has been a bit rocky; but the new kernel level module means no restricted driver and much better performance
[positive]	[14:30]	<nullmind>	neeto: you still have to use xorg.conf :-/
[negative]	[14:30]	<loder>	Is there a search in this chan where i can look up things I don't know like what EnvyNG is?
[negative]	[14:30]	<slytherin>	sanozuke: what do you mean?
[negative]	[14:30]	<ifireball>	sanozuke: you start typing its name in the command line and then press tab, it should then either complete the name or give you completion options
[neutral]	[14:30]	<Adlai>	!envy | loder

[neutral]	[14:30]	<jhoc2x>	how to upgrade from gutsy to hardy?
[neutral]	[14:30]	<evand>	JPSmon: ah, indeed.
[negative]	[14:30]	<sanozuke>	i don't use irc a lot
[negative]	[14:31]	<nullmind>	How can I receive notifications whenever a command is executed?
[negative]	[14:31]	<indian_munnda>	can any one tell me any software package to change my MAC id????
[neutral]	[14:31]	<bhsx>	gangsterlicious: because it's getting POUNDED?
[positive]	[14:31]	<sanozuke>	but is channel is the best
[negative]	[14:31]	<slytherin>	jhoc2x: check channel topic
[neutral]	[14:31]	<IndyGunFreak>	bazhang: so is envy considered safe now, for Hardy?
[negative]	[14:31]	<gangsterlicious>	hmmm, ok
[negative]	[14:31]	<arthur>	@ jhoc2x sudo apt-get update   and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[negative]	[14:31]	<loder>	Oh I do remember, people with Nvidia drivers especially use it  yeah?
[negative]	[14:31]	<Adlai>	nullmind: what sort of notifications?
[neutral]	[14:31]	<bhsx>	look at it this way... there are 1500 ppl IN HERE
[positive]	[14:31]	<nickthorley>	gord_: yes i fully understand - is it possible that after installing and patching the card may be auto detected and work - the updates fixing it or is this highly unlikely?
[neutral]	[14:31]	<shane2peru>	does anyone know if a bug was filed for gnome-desktop install on the server edition?
[negative]	[14:31]	<bazhang>	loder you can /msg ubotu info packagename or /msg ubotu keyword for lots of stuff
[positive]	[14:31]	<jhoc2x>	arthur: thanks bro!
[negative]	[14:31]	<JPSmon>	and then ran a wubi in the wubi's wine?
[neutral]	[14:31]	<spiniker>	hello room
[negative]	[14:31]	<vbabiy-laptop>	hey guys is there any way to install the Ubuntu plugin back in to firefox 3.
[negative]	[14:31]	<bhsx>	think of what the server, trying to dish-out 650MB isos AND updates is goign through?
[positive]	[14:31]	<nullmind>	Adlai: basically like how libnotify notifies you a file has moved, etc., i need to know when something is executed
[positive]	[14:31]	<bazhang>	IndyGunFreak: it is blessed ;] for hardy only though
[neutral]	[14:31]	<shane2peru>	Does anyone have a workaround for getting the gnome desktop installed on server edition?
[negative]	[14:32]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, i know it's possible to install the card without envy because a guy(wich is away) succeeded to install it with the gui in ubuntu
[positive]	[14:32]	<IndyGunFreak>	bazhang: very interesting
[neutral]	[14:32]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: which plugin?
[neutral]	[14:32]	<gord_>	<indian_munnda: macchanger, or mac-changer  from my memory, some card will take it as ifconfig option too
[negative]	[14:32]	<spiniker>	i just updated to the new hardy,but i cant seem to get my emerald themes to run
[positive]	[14:32]	<loder>	bazhang thanks - in some ways my installs worked so well I didn't learn so much

[negative]	[14:32]	<ifireball>	shane2peru: installing the ubuntu-desktop package doesn't work for you?
[negative]	[14:32]	<evand>	ah, sorry, didn't notice that bazhang replied already.
[negative]	[14:32]	<sanozuke>	Iam trying to use perl and things are going better
[neutral]	[14:32]	<shane2peru>	slytherin, yes, gnome-desktop-environment is brokedn
[neutral]	[14:32]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I cant remember offhand but will help you go through it if you wish sometime--there are a couple of bugs that stop some people from using it atm that will be fixed in short order
[negative]	[14:32]	<shane2peru>	ifireball, going to try that now
[neutral]	[14:32]	<sanozuke>	in xubuntu
[neutral]	[14:33]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: you need package ubufox
[positive]	[14:33]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: it lets you choose to install flash or gnash, also helps install java
[negative]	[14:33]	<nullmind>	Adlai: Yeah, i know, but I need a dynamic way to do this. Can I somehow filter bash?
[neutral]	[14:33]	<bhsx>	lilg111111: 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree'
[neutral]	[14:33]	<iluminatus>	where is a german help channel for ubuntu ?
[negative]	[14:33]	<nullmind>	Adlai: I guess I could replace bash and do my filtering there...
[negative]	[14:33]	<Adlai>	nullmind: I'm not aware of how, if it's possible
[neutral]	[14:33]	<nullmind>	Adlai: this is because of this: @HLINK
[neutral]	[14:33]	<loder>	one more question - this inclusion of FF3 beta 5?
[positive]	[14:33]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i used it but its not working correct.When i changed my MAC id the internet stopped working and when i rebooted my PC, MAC was again changd to the older one.
[negative]	[14:33]	<slytherin>	shane2peru: do you just want gnome-desktop?
[neutral]	[14:34]	<nullmind>	loder: Final Fantasy 3 wasn't released in United States
[negative]	[14:34]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: what do you mean by term short order - they will be last to be fixed? - I will be trying to install tonight - approx 8 hours from now if you are around?
[positive]	[14:34]	<shane2peru>	ifireball, nullmind -   ahh, sometimes the simple solutions escape me!  I tried gnome, gnome-desktop, gnome-desktop-environment
[positive]	[14:34]	<loder>	Will aptitude upgrade it to the release as and when it's avaibable
[negative]	[14:34]	<ifireball>	shane2peru: but really if you're gonna do that, install desktop ubuntu and be done with, you're not getting anything from using the server that way
[negative]	[14:34]	<grnmtn>	does anyone know where to find documentation for hardy server?
[neutral]	[14:34]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman-away, @HLINK => i will use envy
[negative]	[14:34]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: i have that package but how do I get it in to firefox
[neutral]	[14:34]	<nullmind>	shane2peru: you can also install kubuntu-desktop for the KDE dekstop
[neutral]	[14:34]	<elektronik123>	hello
[neutral]	[14:34]	<slytherin>	loder: yes
[negative]	[14:34]	<loder>	nullmind I meant Firefox - I can't work out whether your joking there
[positive]	[14:34]	<nullmind>	grnmtn: you can always use $man
[negative]	[14:34]	<gord_>	  nickthorley : possible, more likely u need to google for, for example, {card name) ubuntu hardy and do somethin manually
[neutral]	[14:34]	<lilg111111>	bhsx, i have it already
[positive]	[14:34]	<nullmind>	loder: im always joking :)
[neutral]	[14:35]	<elektronik123>	can i backup Pidgin`s conversation logs ?
[negative]	[14:35]	<bhsx>	restart FF and go to youtube
[neutral]	[14:35]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I will do my best to be around; will try to remember what exactly I did--not much really though ( acoup;e of tweaks iirc)
[neutral]	[14:35]	<alteregoa>	i need a strange help
[positive]	[14:35]	<shane2peru>	ifireball, nullmind thanks guys, I'm a gnomer, and yes I like having my server too, computer handles both just fine, I like the server install, server hobby, desktop for work. :)
[negative]	[14:35]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: I don't understand what you mean by 'get into firefox'
[negative]	[14:35]	<grnmtn>	nullmind: I'm looking for install guides . . . so I'm not to the man stage yet
[negative]	[14:35]	<bazhang>	alteregoa: go ahead and ask
[neutral]	[14:35]	<albech>	where can i find the md5sums on the ubuntu website?
[negative]	[14:35]	<bhsx>	lilg111111: and it doesn't work?
[neutral]	[14:35]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: well I have it installed but firefox doesn't show it installed.
[neutral]	[14:35]	<neeto>	24 bit color depth is not including the 8 bit alpha channel, right?

[negative]	[14:35]	<lilg111111>	bhsx, nope just a black screen shows up with the replay button but no video plays
[neutral]	[14:35]	<nullmind>	grnmtn: you can also browse the packages online and download their docs
[neutral]	[14:35]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes mac-changer usuall opnly last during one boot, changin g mac confuses everything, so u mets ask for new IP by recycling the network, eg: disable it and reeneble it should work for dhcp
[negative]	[14:36]	<shane2peru>	ifireball, nullmind I have xubuntu installed now, and it is ok, but I just like gnome too much, too used to gnome.  Thanks
[neutral]	[14:36]	<bhsx>	lilg111111: you restarted FF?
[negative]	[14:36]	<bazhang>	alteregoa: you need to use my nick if you want an answer thanks

[positive]	[14:36]	<afallenhope>	Does Ubuntu work well with SATA hard drives?
[neutral]	[14:36]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: the addons.
[neutral]	[14:36]	<bazhang>	afallenhope: sure
[negative]	[14:36]	<b33r>	what's the md5sum of hardy amd64 desktop?
[negative]	[14:36]	<shane2peru>	slytherin, I forgot the package name that is why I was trying the gnome-desktop etc.

[neutral]	[14:36]	<nullmind>	b33r: it's on the ubuntu release package
[positive]	[14:36]	<shane2peru>	slytherin, thanks though.
[negative]	[14:36]	<bhsx>	lilg111111: this SHOULDn't have anything to do with it... but try 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras'
[negative]	[14:36]	<arthur>	@ afallenhope ... yeah SATA should be no problem
[positive]	[14:36]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: thanks for your help
[negative]	[14:37]	<grnmtn>	nullimind: I'm trying to set up separate partitions, so I guess 8.04 docs aren't necessary (I doubt that has changed) - but I can't find any decent documentaiton on manually partitioning ubuntu server
[negative]	[14:37]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: Are you checking 'plugins' or 'extensions'?
[positive]	[14:37]	<loder>	afallenhope I don't know what constitutes well but it certainly works on mine
[neutral]	[14:37]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: so use macchanger, then  go to network icon on top toolbar then disbale then reenable it
[positive]	[14:37]	<bazhang>	not yet nickthorley ;]
[negative]	[14:37]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: but i m running a DNS server with a public IP thats why i m looking for MAC changer.

[negative]	[14:37]	<bhsx>	ok, enjoy everyone, this is too busy for me to be much help
[neutral]	[14:37]	<nullmind>	grnmtn: are you going to use the Live CD to install, it has GParted a GNOME-based partition editor that is very sexy
[positive]	[14:37]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: both

[negative]	[14:37]	<RWB>	could someone give me a link to the release info on Hardy?
[neutral]	[14:37]	<bazhang>	go ahead joshua__ easy on the enter key though
[negative]	[14:37]	<alteregoa>	a mac changer, so you had a power pc mac, and now you try to change to intel?
[neutral]	[14:37]	<immesys>	joshua__: just ask
[negative]	[14:38]	<greentomate>	when will archive.ubuntu be back up??? I can/t get any packages as of now and it is quite frustrating.
[neutral]	[14:38]	<[T]-Rex>	lol
[negative]	[14:38]	<joshua__>	I am running dual boot with vista 64 and when i installed hardy i could read my ntfs data
[negative]	[14:38]	<jhoc2x>	how are thing between hardy and gutsy??? i'd like to know before upgrading to hardy
[negative]	[14:38]	<loder>	It is busy actually - the busiest I've ever seen any IRC channel in my life!
[neutral]	[14:38]	<ere4si>	joshua__: just ask your qustion - it gets busy here
[neutral]	[14:38]	<nullmind>	greentomate: go to Admin->Software sources and choose a local mirror
[negative]	[14:38]	<alteregoa>	i have no glue with xorg.conf
[positive]	[14:38]	<bazhang>	rwb www.fsckin.com has the best one (in Plain English)
[negative]	[14:38]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: have you restarted firefox? Any chance you are using firefox2 instead of firefox3.
[negative]	[14:38]	<immesys>	joshua__: thats a feature
[positive]	[14:38]	<nullmind>	greentomate: im in Portland, OR and choose cat.pdx down the street :)
[negative]	[14:38]	<afallenhope>	what about an Asus vid card?
[negative]	[14:38]	<LainIwakura>	I cannot find the artwiz package in the hardy repositories. How do I find which respoistory to add so that I can apt-get xfonts-artwiz2?
[neutral]	[14:38]	<joshua__>	now it says cannot mount
[neutral]	[14:38]	<RWB>	thnx
[negative]	[14:38]	<slytherin>	greentomate: use local mirror please

[neutral]	[14:38]	<greentomate>	yes yes ill try
[neutral]	[14:39]	<grnmtn>	nullmind: ubuntu server livecd doesn't appear to include gparted
[neutral]	[14:39]	<vbabiy-laptop>	no slytherin its firefox 3
[neutral]	[14:39]	<bazhang>	afallenhope: what chipset
[positive]	[14:39]	<immesys>	joshua__: its probably because the ntfs journal is dirty. reboot into windows and shut down nicely
[negative]	[14:39]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: aha, so ion that case u need to recycle the fixed IP, anyone help with a foolproff method in hardy? no box here on 8.04 to talk him thru.. :(
[negative]	[14:39]	<joshua__>	I downloaded and installed a ntfs3g thing and i guess that i didnt need it for hardy, but since installing that i have no access
[neutral]	[14:39]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: perhaps a firefox restart is needed
[negative]	[14:39]	<arthur>	"@ slytherin: What else is to do for Firefox Java then ""sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre"" ?"
[positive]	[14:39]	<grnmtn>	i'm sort of shocked that they would release 8.04 without update documentation at the same time
[negative]	[14:39]	<q4a>	hi to all, I want to install ubuntu on laptop Samsung Q45 F000. I tried to do it with 7.10 and 8.04 - but i can't: it fades at attempt to start from a disk without installation. Whether it is possible to try to start ubuntu from USB flash drive and how? Or some one can already have the same problem?
[neutral]	[14:39]	<nullmind>	grnmtn: yes, the Ubuntu Desktop does include GParted
[negative]	[14:39]	<joshua__>	i tried removing it in synaptic, however it didnt work
[neutral]	[14:39]	<afallenhope>	965wh
[negative]	[14:39]	<vbabiy-laptop>	sorry slytherin I didn't notice I had firefox open on a different desktop
[neutral]	[14:39]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i m running gutsy
[negative]	[14:40]	<vbabiy-laptop>	so it was not restarting
[negative]	[14:40]	<greentomate>	"another question: how do i make it so i dont have to type root password all the time. Isn't there a way to have it autofilled? i mean, i understand why it wants to prompt you, but why should i have to actually type a pw in as supposed to hitting ""OK Proceed"""
[neutral]	[14:40]	<joshua__>	removing it worked
[neutral]	[14:40]	<nullmind>	grnmtn: you can always use the parted application for command-line partitioning
[neutral]	[14:40]	<pawan>	hi
[neutral]	[14:40]	<joshua__>	but ntfs didnt
[negative]	[14:40]	<bazhang>	grnmtn: they did you just need to look for it: www.distrowatch.com has the official one
[positive]	[14:40]	<slytherin>	arthur: you also need sun-java6-plugin :-D
[neutral]	[14:40]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: u see the moment u change the MAC all your network switches get confused, they try to talk to the OLD mac, in their arp-caches i think
[neutral]	[14:40]	<pawan>	how to download videos from youtube
[negative]	[14:40]	<dwhsix>	Hardy upgrade Q: I torrented the alternate CD, burned it, but when did the upgrade it seems to be downloading everything from the new and not using the CD...

[negative]	[14:40]	<nullmind>	joshua__: do you know how to open a terminal?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<joshua__>	not sure how
[positive]	[14:40]	<bhsx>	ok i will say this for anyone having troubles with FROSTWIRE or LIMEWIRE....   over the course of the beta, and including the final release...  install the FrostWire .deb.  then 'gksudo gedit /usr/bin/FrostWire' and make the file '#!/bin/bash  -  cd /usr/lib/frostwire - java -jar FrostWire.jar' then 'sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/FrostWire' then just type (or create a shortcut) for 'FrostWire' and it will run just fine...
[neutral]	[14:40]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: k, gutsy then anyone?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<bazhang>	!info youtube-dl | pawan

[negative]	[14:40]	<dwhsix>	(this /may/ be because I started an upgrade and said 'yes, do the updates now', but then cancelled that and started over...)
[neutral]	[14:40]	<afallenhope>	 
[neutral]	[14:40]	<moDumass>	booya. the solution to cracly sound is to turn the application your usings volume down to 70% but turn up your master, it removes the crackling static scratchy clicks
[neutral]	[14:40]	<moDumass>	awesometastic
[negative]	[14:40]	<loder>	q4a that's the odd thing there are some systems - I have one - that won't do livecds - but will install from install cds fine
[neutral]	[14:40]	<pawan>	i am using gutsy
[negative]	[14:41]	<arthur>	@ slytherin there is no sun-java6-plugin
[neutral]	[14:41]	<grnmtn>	bazhang: if you look at @HLINK it is all 7.10 or older
[negative]	[14:41]	<loder>	someone told me it can be because the system ram isn't fast enough
[negative]	[14:41]	<bazhang>	sudo apt-get install youtube-dl pawan then in the terminal youtube-dl (the url of the vid you want here)
[positive]	[14:41]	<bhsx>	arthur yes, there is

[negative]	[14:41]	<nullmind>	greentomate: you want to change the sudo timeout
[negative]	[14:41]	<immesys>	joshua__: ok do you know the /dev/ name of your drive?
[neutral]	[14:41]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: basically, i think u just do this, run macchanger, go up to network-manager icon on top toolbar, disable networking, then do it again to enable networking
[negative]	[14:42]	<bhsx>	arthur: it's called 'sun-java6-plugin' i'm looking at it right now in Synaptic
[neutral]	[14:42]	<joshua__>	i get 73.1 gb media

[negative]	[14:42]	<arthur>	"@ bhsx do I have to use ""software from 3rd part"""
[negative]	[14:42]	<bazhang>	loder more likely a video or acpi issue; you might try with the acpi=off boot parameter
[positive]	[14:42]	<bhsx>	arthur: it installs sun-java6-jre and sun-java6-bin
[negative]	[14:42]	<LainIwakura>	I could install a package with the Gutsy repositories. How do I install that package in Hardy?
[neutral]	[14:42]	<immesys>	joshua__: join #tmp32
[negative]	[14:42]	<Fritzel>	where should I go to look for new themes and backgrounds?
[negative]	[14:42]	<grnmtn>	bazhang: I understand the nature of community work, but for a distro that is trying succeed on a commerical level, it is unprofessional - they shouldn't have released the distro until the docs were ready
[neutral]	[14:42]	<elektronik123>	8.04 isn`t good translate into polish
[negative]	[14:42]	<bhsx>	you should have universe and multiverse checked by default

[neutral]	[14:43]	<arthur>	@ bshx I both got them installed
[negative]	[14:43]	<loder>	bazhang actually that sounds right - at least on that system I always have to force acpi on and off in the modules

[negative]	[14:59]	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: ok man. I hope they do...meanwhile, lets enjoy new Ubuntu, jejeje...Thanks a lot! By the way, do you know how to change the name of the disks shown in the desktop???
[neutral]	[14:59]	<Sajuukkhar>	windows isnt installed on here
[negative]	[14:59]	<eimajentha1>	"stupid question: why is my root (i.e. mounted at ""/"") partition commented out in /etc/fstab?  I'm running Ubuntu Server 8.04, and it's working fine, but that seems odd to me."
[positive]	[14:59]	<spiniker>	men i guess i was lucky enough
[neutral]	[14:59]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ok, so the physiocal address is the new one u specified on macchanger then?
[neutral]	[14:59]	<bazhang>	eltech likely because it has dependencies--best to waiut and get from the repos
[neutral]	[14:59]	<eltech>	k
[negative]	[14:59]	<dystopianray>	Jessid: not in ubuntu, no
[negative]	[14:59]	<gord_>	indian_munnda:...for the specific network card u are using, or eth0 if u only have one network card/nic
[neutral]	[14:59]	<SeanTater>	If there is this much lag at this market share, what will it be like when everyone uses ubuntu?
[neutral]	[15:00]	<Sajuukkhar>	can i make my own partitions
[neutral]	[15:00]	<indian_munnda_>	gord_: are talking about the hardware address?
[negative]	[15:00]	<cguillermo>	Have you tried installing with the alternate cd?
[positive]	[15:00]	<loder>	LainIwakura @HLINK is about adding repositories generally and the Gutsy one i presume is main - I'm actually using Debian today I I can't actually read it off for you
[neutral]	[15:00]	<Sake>	how do I set local mirrors from the command line? I'm using ubuntu server..
[neutral]	[15:00]	<spiniker>	im now about to upgrade my laptop to 8.04..
[neutral]	[15:00]	<bakom>	hey
[neutral]	[15:00]	<Sajuukkhar>	wot alternate cd?
[negative]	[15:00]	<gord_>	indian_munnda:yes thats it sorry
[negative]	[15:00]	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: mmm ok. Now that you say it, I am curious to know what distro do you use!
[negative]	[15:00]	<bazhang>	SeanTater: interesting but not really suited to this channel thanks
[negative]	[15:00]	<amenado>	eimajentha1-> can you paste your /etc/fstab for us to see?
[positive]	[15:00]	<loder>	that was an excessive use of the word actually sorry about that :)
[positive]	[15:00]	<schnootop>	Since installing hardy my gfx card doesnt get recognised and i get default screen resolution. What is the best way to configure this ?
[neutral]	[15:00]	<dystopianray>	Jessid: kubuntu
[neutral]	[15:00]	<PMantis>	Ubuntu 8.04 JeOS torrent file anyone?
[neutral]	[15:00]	<LainIwakura>	loder: Okay thanks.. although another user said that I should not add a gutsy repository line in my hardy sources.list?
[negative]	[15:00]	<tomd123>	Sake: install desktop if you don't know
[negative]	[15:00]	<indian_munnda_>	gord_: ok let me see.
[positive]	[15:00]	<Scunizi>	SeanTater, I think there will be more mirrors available.
[neutral]	[15:00]	<bazhang>	!alternate | Sajuukkhar
[positive]	[15:00]	<ubotu>	Sajuukkhar: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at @HLINK
[positive]	[15:00]	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: Ok man! see you! And thanks a lot!
[positive]	[15:01]	<cguillermo>	theres the desktop edition, and an alternate one, that gives you additional options for installing
[negative]	[15:01]	<bakom>	schnootop, I have the same problem
[negative]	[15:01]	<Sajuukkhar>	u mean the i386 one and the other one?
[positive]	[15:01]	<loder>	LainIwakura well as to the wisdom I couldn't say - I'm just a newbie who can search :)
[positive]	[15:01]	<bazhang>	LainIwakura: dont mix repos versions; bad juju will happen ;]
[neutral]	[15:01]	<schnootop>	bakom, have you gotten anywhere yet or know why its happening >
[negative]	[15:01]	<LainIwakura>	loder: Hehe, alright.
[neutral]	[15:01]	<spiniker>	is there a room for emerald?
[negative]	[15:01]	<LainIwakura>	bazhang: Okay.. :/
[neutral]	[15:01]	<cguillermo>	no, there is a desktop and an alternate cd for i386
[negative]	[15:01]	<bakom>	nope, sorry, schnootop
[negative]	[15:02]	<schnootop>	thats ok, ill update all my packages and see if that will fix it
[neutral]	[15:02]	<bazhang>	spiniker: you can try #compiz-fusion
[negative]	[15:02]	<spiniker>	i cant seem to get it running on hardy
[negative]	[15:02]	<spiniker>	ok thnks
[neutral]	[15:02]	<Sajuukkhar>	where can i get the alternate cd
[neutral]	[15:02]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	hi all
[negative]	[15:02]	<Sajuukkhar>	ok
[negative]	[15:02]	<Scunizi>	PMantis, @HLINK    2 secs on google.. found it
[negative]	[15:02]	<loder>	LainIwakura I actually added the VLc repos before it became standard fair and obviously that doesn't pose any conflict issues
[negative]	[15:02]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	i wanna more info about wubi
[neutral]	[15:03]	<LainIwakura>	loder: I see.
[neutral]	[15:03]	<bazhang>	@HLINK Sajuukkhar

[neutral]	[15:03]	<Fatty>	Is there any way that I can update my current ubuntu to ubuntu 8, without burning it to a cd?
[negative]	[15:03]	<loder>	I better go - I think I'm a good learner but not so good a teacher LOL
[neutral]	[15:03]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	nice project
[negative]	[15:03]	<cguillermo>	you shouldnt have to, if your installing from the entire disk the partitions are created automatically.
[neutral]	[15:03]	<loder>	Seeya
[positive]	[15:03]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	it works????
[neutral]	[15:04]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	is stable?
[positive]	[15:04]	<treut>	flashplugin doesnt work in opera, with ubuntu 8.04
[negative]	[15:04]	<bazhang>	Fatty: sure; just via the net you mean?
[neutral]	[15:04]	<Valeria28>	\whois
[negative]	[15:04]	<evand>	Aragorn_Guardian: Mimi: uhm, no, it's not available in Ubuntu Server
[negative]	[15:04]	<Mimi>	Aragorn_Guardian:  You can install any Ubuntu ISO or CD you got using Wubi. Read the Faq
[positive]	[15:04]	<evand>	Aragorn_Guardian: yes, it works.  Yes, it's stable (though see the note about running it on Windows Vista)
[positive]	[15:04]	<bazhang>	loder not so; you are very helpful thanks!
[negative]	[15:04]	<PMantis>	Scunizi: Hmmm, 0 seeders, 0 leechers. Perhaps there's another on google.
[negative]	[15:04]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	nice...gonna read the faq
[negative]	[15:04]	<Fatty>	yea, i mean, i just installed ubuntu 7 like 2 weeks ago and now ubuntu 8 is out so i don't want to burn to cd, just want to like...update, some easy way

[neutral]	[15:05]	<bazhang>	fatty you can dist-upgrade if you wish
[negative]	[15:05]	<Sajuukkhar>	my partitions; 1 20 gig ext 3 with /home mount point, 2 20 gig ext 3 with / mount point, 3 789 mb swap file
[positive]	[15:05]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	there are something like a xp theme for gnome???
[negative]	[15:05]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	people are too confusing with linux desktop...
[positive]	[15:05]	<Mimi>	Aragorn_Guardian:  If you are good enough at computers that you want to use Server, you shouldn't need Wubi ;)
[negative]	[15:05]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	i hate users.. :/
[neutral]	[15:05]	<Fatty>	bazhang, just type dist-upgrade in a terminal?
[positive]	[15:05]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i did that and it showed the new MAC id.
[neutral]	[15:05]	<Scunizi>	PMantis, @HLINK
[negative]	[15:05]	<LainIwakura>	Is it hard to install a font by myself? Since the font I want to install is not in the Hardy repository
[negative]	[15:05]	<bazhang>	fatty you need to make sure 7.10 is completely up-to-date first

[neutral]	[15:06]	<Myrtti>	LainIwakura: put it in .fonts in your home directory
[negative]	[15:06]	<KiwiJoker>	so whats hardy like so far?
[neutral]	[15:06]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	Mimi: an old with a windows....blarg
[negative]	[15:06]	<iddo>	where do i see the last messages of the status log of the upgrade?
[negative]	[15:06]	<gord_>	indian_munnda:ok good, so macchanger has at least worked....let me think a little 2 mins
[neutral]	[15:06]	<Aragorn_Guardian>	Mimi: but nice...thanks
[neutral]	[15:06]	<bazhang>	KiwiJoker: try it out for yourself
[negative]	[15:06]	<Sajuukkhar>	nope didnt work, one of the ext systems failed
[neutral]	[15:06]	<Scunizi>	Myrtti, he still have to rebuild the font cache
[negative]	[15:06]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: ok take your time.
[positive]	[15:06]	<KiwiJoker>	i will, but hows hardy working for others?
[negative]	[15:06]	<PMantis>	Scunizi: Oh, lovely, that took me to poro links when I tried to download
[positive]	[15:06]	<Mimi>	Aragorn_Guardian:   so you basically need  the server in a virtual machine to play around in? I do that too... try Virtual Box if you haven't yet. Works very well on windows
[negative]	[15:07]	<Fatty>	oooh, just got an internal server error trying to go to that webpage
[positive]	[15:07]	<tomd123>	KiwiJoker: Its easy and everything works alot better
[positive]	[15:07]	<bazhang>	KiwiJoker: this is not a chat channel; bit crowded for that thanks
[positive]	[15:07]	<PMantis>	Scunizi: I do appreciate the effort, though. :)

[neutral]	[15:08]	<usicow>	When I apt-get something, it always goes to us.archive.ubuntu.com. How can I change that?
[neutral]	[15:08]	<PMantis>	Scunizi: Heh, NP... google.com/linux was a good pinter
[neutral]	[15:08]	<bazhang>	elektronik123: you got banned?

[neutral]	[15:08]	<elektronik123>	bazhang yes
[negative]	[15:08]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ok the, the harwdware address of OK, does it have a IP address for that card? I assume eth0?
[neutral]	[15:08]	<jburd>	usicow: System > Administration > Software Sources
[positive]	[15:08]	<elektronik123>	a lot time ago
[neutral]	[15:08]	<bazhang>	usicow: choose another mirror in synaptic
[negative]	[15:09]	<spiniker>	would hardy still run on my old hp pIII machine,256mb ram?
[negative]	[15:09]	<ToxicSoul2>	So I have slight problem, after upgrading my numpad no longer works
[negative]	[15:09]	<bharath>	I installed hardy today; wireless does not work; hp pavilion laptop; Intel(R) 3945ABG/BG chip; iwl3945 driver. I see the chipset being detected in dmesg. But ifconfig does not show this interface. This was working perfectly in gutsy. Installing backports-modules did not help. Please help.
[neutral]	[15:09]	<bazhang>	spiniker: gnome hardy? doubtful
[negative]	[15:09]	<jburd>	spiniker: Sure.  Give it a try.  You might want to use xubuntu though.
[negative]	[15:09]	<usicow>	jburd/bazhang: Im only on SSH though.. do you know how I can do it via the console?
[negative]	[15:09]	<cguillermo>	Sajuukkhar, you should reformat your drive first. the easiest way I know to do that without having an os installed is with the alternate cd
[negative]	[15:09]	<amenado>	eimajentha1-> it looks like your /dev/sda1 is mounted to /
[neutral]	[15:09]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i have provided the public IP to the card which was given to me by the ISP.
[negative]	[15:10]	<Fatty>	bazhang, that link doesn't work
[neutral]	[15:10]	<elektronik123>	bazhang what can i do ?
[negative]	[15:10]	<cguillermo>	you should try it
[negative]	[15:10]	<Sake>	is there a terminal that's comparable to putty on windows?
[negative]	[15:10]	<Stockfisch>	is anyone here using epiphany instead of firefox ?
[neutral]	[15:10]	<jburd>	usicow: You can forward X requests through SSH.   Just ssh in using ssh -X foobar@blah
[negative]	[15:10]	<DJones>	spiniker: xubuntu might be better for a machine with that spec
[positive]	[15:10]	<Ubuntong>	 Does Hardy Heron support compiz on new ATI cards?
[negative]	[15:10]	<eimajentha1>	amenado: yes, but it's commented out, why is that?
[negative]	[15:10]	<sletak>	I've checked the forum but didnt see any recent hits, my new hardy is hanging when syncing to the repository on Translation-en_US.  Seemed to be some hits in google going back to each release.  Anyone else gettign this?
[positive]	[15:10]	<spiniker>	no imean i have 7.10 installed right now..but i think it's slowing down..
[neutral]	[15:10]	<jburd>	usicow: Or you'll need to manually edit: /etc/apt/sources.list
[negative]	[15:10]	<Nith>	Sake: there is putty for linux
[neutral]	[15:10]	<amenado>	eimajentha1-> it is not commented out, its the line that starts at UUID=xxxx
[positive]	[15:10]	<bazhang>	bharath: the transiton from ipw to iwl has a couple of outstanding bugs at the moment--the launchpad page has a couple of possible workarounds iirc
[negative]	[15:10]	<ddrplayer512>	sletak: I'm getting this problem as well...
[neutral]	[15:10]	<jburd>	You don't need putty for linux
[neutral]	[15:10]	<treut>	Is anyone manage to get flashplayer working in opera with ubuntu 8.04 x86 ?
[negative]	[15:10]	<rohan>	is there _any_ way to install ubuntu using the iso but without burning the cd? all the cdrw's that i've got are bad :(
[neutral]	[15:10]	<sletak>	putty for linux is gtk1
[negative]	[15:10]	<gord_>	indian_munnda:ok, just confirm that you have a dirdcect (network) connection to the internet? u dont use a modem/router/firewall? for example?
[positive]	[15:10]	<bharath>	thanks bazhang; I will look for them
[neutral]	[15:11]	<Fatty>	I have the same question as rohan
[neutral]	[15:11]	<DJones>	!usb | rohan
[positive]	[15:11]	<ubotu>	rohan: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see @HLINK - For a persistent live USB install, see: @HLINK
[neutral]	[15:11]	<Nith>	you don't need it, but it does exist
[neutral]	[15:11]	<schnootop>	anyone know the best way to rebuild my source.list with the latest sources ?
[negative]	[15:11]	<gord_>	indian_munnda:direct# bad keyboard skills after 24 hours of release-helping haha
[positive]	[15:11]	<amenado>	eimajentha1-> read carefully, the line before it is a comment  #/dev/sda1  but next line starting with UUID is not
[negative]	[15:11]	<ddrplayer512>	The package manager hangs when I try to update simply because, at least I think, a server is down...
[neutral]	[15:11]	<Sajuukkhar>	i have reformatted this tho so many times
[neutral]	[15:11]	<jburd>	rohan, Fatty: sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 <ISO_PATH> /mnt/
[negative]	[15:11]	<Nith>	rohan: do you have a second computer (linux)?
[neutral]	[15:11]	<bazhang>	fatty okay; change gutsy to hardy in sources.list then sudo apt-get update  followed by sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (and wait for a bit as a ton of packages are downloaede)
[negative]	[15:11]	<sletak>	Sake: what are you trying to accomplish?  Do you need wyse60 emulation or something?
[neutral]	[15:11]	<jburd>	rohan: Mount the ISO to a point.
[negative]	[15:11]	<eimajentha1>	amenado: I see!  the UUID identifies the filesystem, and /dev/sda1 is just there for my benefit?
[positive]	[15:11]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: ;) , yes it is a direct connection to the ISP.
[negative]	[15:12]	<rohan>	jburd: but then what?
[neutral]	[15:12]	<spiniker>	can i upgrade using the terminal?
[negative]	[15:12]	<rohan>	Nith: no, second computer is windows only :(
[negative]	[15:12]	<jburd>	rohan: after that run this if you aren't already prompted:
[negative]	[15:12]	<Fatty>	where is sources.list, again?
[neutral]	[15:12]	<jburd>	/etc/apt/sources.list
[neutral]	[15:12]	<elektronik123>	where are irc ops ?
[negative]	[15:12]	<Fatty>	ah ok
[neutral]	[15:12]	<frieze>	so is there a way to use a remote gui tool to set up a firewall on an ubuntu server install without actually installing x windows on the server itself?
[neutral]	[15:12]	<bazhang>	spiniker: from gutsy to hardy? sure
[negative]	[15:12]	<amenado>	eimajentha1-> please man fstab  so you can understand what that file is about

[neutral]	[15:12]	<jburd>	gksudo 'sh /mnt/cdromupgrade'
[neutral]	[15:12]	<rohan>	jburd: it's a desktop cd, not a alternate one

[neutral]	[15:13]	<makkbe>	spiniker: yes, do-release-upgrade
[neutral]	[15:13]	<bazhang>	elektronik123: go to #ubuntu-ops
[negative]	[15:13]	<jburd>	Oh, I see.  You can't upgrade always using the Desktop CD rohan

[negative]	[15:13]	<nappula>	I can see my wireless card on my iwconfig and the mode is auto even though it should be managed but I can't get the card down to change the mode
[positive]	[15:13]	<jburd>	rohan: You'll need the alternate disc.  It's best to download the live/alternate DVD ISO
[neutral]	[15:13]	<eimajentha1>	amenado: Reading
[negative]	[15:13]	<Nith>	frieze: yes, using ssh and +X you can run ayn gui program and the comp you're sshing into doesn't need an X server
[positive]	[15:13]	<Sake>	slestak: I dunno what that means. I just like how putty uses a small font and works with everything. :)
[negative]	[15:13]	<ddrplayer512>	Hello everyone! My package manager freezes when I try to reload the repositories. I had just done a fresh install less than 30 minutes ago. Does anyone else have this problem
[negative]	[15:13]	<Itaku>	my number keys on the right dont work but i have num lock on. how do i fix it
[negative]	[15:13]	<Fatty>	bazhang, you said change gutsy to hardy, how do i do that? do i need to download the iso first?
[neutral]	[15:13]	<ddrplayer512>	?
[negative]	[15:13]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ok then, (some ppl dont realise it might be the modem/router mac they have to change/spoof ) OK, so can you ping anything? try ping 72.14.207.99   its google.com

[positive]	[15:14]	<amenado>	ddrplayer512-> the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[neutral]	[15:14]	<Sajuukkhar>	8 hours until i get this alternate cd
[neutral]	[15:14]	<bazhang>	makkbe: sorry; what is the full command? do-release-upgrade in the run command or int the terminal
[neutral]	[15:14]	<nibsa1242b>	ddrplayer512: the repos are overwhelmed... give people a few days to upgrade and they'll stop being swamped
[neutral]	[15:14]	<unimatrix9>	hardy : when i try to open login screen settings it does not start it, any tips?
[negative]	[15:14]	<snadge>	i have a gutsy install.. and the alternate install for hardy, and the first time i put the disc in.. it asked me if i wanted to upgrade, and then failed (because i couldn't connect to internet).. and now when i put the disc in, it no longer prompts to upgrade.. how do i fix this
[neutral]	[15:14]	<amenado>	jones yes, its very very slow
[neutral]	[15:14]	<makkbe>	bazhang: in the terminal
[neutral]	[15:14]	<treut>	hi
[negative]	[15:14]	<termitor>	someone have wifi bug ? the wifi get slowing after 15 minutes , (ralink 2500 pci )
[negative]	[15:14]	<rohan>	Nith: what were you going to suggest anyway?
[negative]	[15:14]	<Sajuukkhar>	what happens if the alternate cd doesnt work for my partitions?
[negative]	[15:14]	<nibsa1242b>	Sajuukkhar: try a torrent, I got one in less then an hour
[neutral]	[15:14]	<jones>	amenado: thanks. just curious.
[negative]	[15:14]	<red_>	i cant install limepro coz gdebi says it connot connect to ubuntu repository while the downloading the last file. my system is up to date with all repo except source code enabled. do i need to add another repo on the list
[neutral]	[15:14]	<bazhang>	makkbe: is that preceded by anything? or just that command
[neutral]	[15:14]	<amenado>	unimatrix9-> try  ctrl+alt+F1 to F5 to test the log on
[negative]	[15:14]	<rohan>	jburd: anyway, i'd rather clean install than upgrade
[neutral]	[15:14]	<asigrist>	are the package servers down right now?
[negative]	[15:15]	<ddrplayer512>	Ah... I imagine that. I've seen that happen when Gutsy came out, too. I should have known... Thanks!
[negative]	[15:15]	<Nith>	rohan: I've got a computer without a working CDROM drive, I use a PXE server to install
[negative]	[15:15]	<snadge>	"how do i ""force"" gutsy to update to hardy using the install cd? (after its already failed once and no longer prompts to upgrade)"
[neutral]	[15:15]	<ddrplayer512>	I'll try later.
[neutral]	[15:15]	<Sajuukkhar>	nibs, i have 25 kb/s internet
[positive]	[15:15]	<Nith>	rohan: its a bit long to set up but it works well
[positive]	[15:15]	<amenado>	asigrist-> -> the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[neutral]	[15:15]	<makkbe>	bazhang: no, just that command
[negative]	[15:15]	<unimatrix9>	amendado, i want to set it to auto login, but the manager does not start
[negative]	[15:15]	<jones>	is there a way to remove the firefox 3 beta and use the old firefox? i have a lot of plugins that do not work in 3.. thanks for any help
[neutral]	[15:15]	<unimatrix9>	from gnome menu systeem..
[negative]	[15:15]	<frieze>	Nith: thanks. I thought that when I ran ssh -Y it was doing forwarding but my understanding was that all teh gui stuff was happening on the remote machine using my local machine as a display. Since it seems like server and client are used interchangeably in x11 terminology I may have gotten that back-to-front
[negative]	[15:15]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: no i can't ping anything other than my ISP server(the server to which i login before using).
[negative]	[15:15]	<asigrist>	amenado, yea my network connection is quite fast yet i still can't even reload my repositories data.
[negative]	[15:15]	<bazhang>	fatty you want to do this all via the cli?
[neutral]	[15:15]	<makkbe>	jones: sudo apt-get install firefox-2
[neutral]	[15:15]	<Fatty>	cli?
[positive]	[15:15]	<makkbe>	then you will have both of them installed
[negative]	[15:16]	<jones>	makke: do i need to remove the 3 version?
[negative]	[15:16]	<rohan>	Nith: there's no PXE server available for windows? anyway, for that you'd need the alternate disc, right?
[negative]	[15:16]	<Sajuukkhar>	so what happens if the alternate cd doesnt work? do i just give up and go back to dapper drake?
[positive]	[15:16]	<amenado>	unimatrix9-> try  ctrl+alt+F1 to F5 to test the log on  <-- to test it first
[negative]	[15:16]	<red_>	i cant install limewire pro coz gdebi says it connot connect to ubuntu repository while downloading the last file. my system is up to date with all repo except source code enabled. do i need to add another repo on the list? any help pls

[neutral]	[15:16]	<Fatty>	yes, help me, lol

[positive]	[15:16]	<spiniker>	well it's taking a little while,but hey,its worth the wait..
[positive]	[15:16]	<gord_>	"indian_munnda: aha , i see. and that ping is by IP? not ""domain.org"" yes?"
[neutral]	[15:17]	<makkbe>	Fatty: just run do-release-upgrade in a terminal
[neutral]	[15:17]	<mino>	any french channel pls?
[neutral]	[15:17]	<bazhang>	!fr
[positive]	[15:17]	<makkbe>	it will upgrade from gutsy to hardy
[neutral]	[15:17]	<ubotu>	Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[negative]	[15:17]	<Nith>	rohan: yeah. Any reason you can't just upgate?
[positive]	[15:17]	<jones>	makkbe: how will it know which one to load? also will all the flash and java work between the 2 of them? thanks for the help
[negative]	[15:17]	<Theo_>	Restricted drivers: why does it say my graphics driver is not in use?
[negative]	[15:17]	<amenado>	Sajuukkhar-> try to make it work
[positive]	[15:17]	<rohan>	Nith: i usually like clean installs :)
[neutral]	[15:17]	<makkbe>	jones: ff2 will show up in your app menu
[negative]	[15:17]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i can only ping my gateway nothing else.
[negative]	[15:17]	<makkbe>	so you will have to choose for yourself which one to start
[negative]	[15:17]	<jburd>	rohan: Some of us can't do clean installs without going to great lengths
[negative]	[15:17]	<jones>	makkbe: ok i will try it now.
[negative]	[15:18]	<Fatty>	thanks makkbe, i'll let you know if that works
[negative]	[15:18]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: hmmmm ok. we're reaching the ned of my sure-fire knowledge here i'm afraid :(
[positive]	[15:18]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: :)
[positive]	[15:18]	<rohan>	jburd: i seem to be one of them, and only for a lack of a cd :-/
[negative]	[15:18]	<amenado>	rohan-> what do you consider clean install? you can try something like from install from scratch with  debootstrap  but for now only available is 7.10 not 8.04 yet
[negative]	[15:18]	<ddrplayer512>	I really like that new thing where you can use the desktop CD and choose the option to just Install Ubuntu. Has anyone tried that?
[neutral]	[15:18]	<rohan>	fedora iso has a convenient livecd-iso-to-usb script
[neutral]	[15:19]	<Fatty>	0% [working] for a while now
[neutral]	[15:19]	<bazhang>	ddrplayer512: aye its nice
[negative]	[15:19]	<d1nker>	Theo_: if you figure it out let me know
[neutral]	[15:19]	<artti>	Does sudo apt-get upgrade will upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04?
[negative]	[15:19]	<jburd>	rohan: I have tons of development stuff lying around that I don't want to recreate
[neutral]	[15:19]	<makkbe>	artti: no
[negative]	[15:19]	<snadge>	can anyone tell me how to make it so when i insert the alternate install cd to my gutsy install.. it prompts me to upgrade?? its only done it once, and no longer asks me.. there must be some temp files laying around or something?\
[neutral]	[15:19]	<tomd123>	artti: no
[neutral]	[15:19]	<makkbe>	artti: but do-release-upgrade will
[positive]	[15:19]	<bazhang>	rohan ubuntu has one as well
[negative]	[15:19]	<spiniker>	maybe ill upgrade in the next few days..it's taking too long
[positive]	[15:19]	<amenado>	Fatty-> the far end server is very very busy, your update may not complete for a long time..far too many downloading
[positive]	[15:19]	<qryzy>	anyone assist in configuring networ where rest of pc have xp
[positive]	[15:19]	<jburd>	spiniker: Use a different mirror
[positive]	[15:19]	<bhsx>	hey, i have Crossover Office 6.2 and it works great, but I was wondering how the 'official' ubuntu wine package is?  does it have a GUI fe now like was planned?
[negative]	[15:19]	<Theo_>	How do I enable my ati graphics card?
[positive]	[15:19]	<Ubuntong>	 Does Hardy Heron support compiz on new ATI video cards?
[neutral]	[15:19]	<rohan>	bazhang: where?
[negative]	[15:19]	<bhsx>	is it 1.0?
[neutral]	[15:20]	<bazhang>	rohan you can /msg ubotu install for a link
[negative]	[15:20]	<Fatty>	yea i figured, it'll download eventually though right?
[negative]	[15:20]	<nibsa1242b>	snadge: hold on one sec I think I have an answer for you

[neutral]	[15:20]	<bazhang>	never heard that do-release-upgrade before though
[positive]	[15:20]	<snadge>	nibsa1242b: holding on ;)
[positive]	[15:20]	<ddrplayer512>	I don't usually upgrade over the Internet on the day it comes out. I can't install software for Hardy. I'm glad I didn't upgrade from Dapper. I was considering that... Scary... :)
[neutral]	[15:20]	<makkbe>	Ubuntong: yes, no worries here
[negative]	[15:21]	<gord_>	"indian_munnda: so, to recap you have used macchanger to change a mac, verified it in ifconfig, assigned manual public as given by ISP, and you can ping your default gateway at the ISP. You have a direct network connection (no modem/router involved)? ideas anyone? i susspect this isnt an ubuntu problem, more a ""spoof mac to get public IP on a new-box"" question, different channel suggestions anyone?"
[negative]	[15:21]	<roychri>	"I am trying to run the update on my 7.10 but it stuck at ""Downloading file 15 of 24"". Any suggestions?"
[neutral]	[15:21]	<jburd>	Does the upgrade tool store all the downloaded packages in /var/cache/apt/archives?
[positive]	[15:21]	<slytherin>	cal_: I believe there is a bug, search on launchpad.net
[positive]	[15:21]	<Fatty>	THANKS EVERYONE
[positive]	[15:21]	<JohnMM>	woo hardy haron is released :D
[neutral]	[15:21]	<bazhang>	ddrplayer512: there is a dirct path from dapper to hardy you know
[positive]	[15:21]	<Ubuntong>	makkbe: That would be awesome.  It's always an issue foe me. Thanks!
[negative]	[15:21]	<nibsa1242b>	"snadge: according to @HLINK bottom of the page you use the following command gksu ""sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"""
[neutral]	[15:21]	<rohan>	bazhang: that guide is for installing using the hdd
[negative]	[15:21]	<andycaass>	What was the program that enabled you to see cpu temps on app bar?
[positive]	[15:21]	<amenado>	rochri -> -> the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[positive]	[15:21]	<rohan>	bazhang: but will work great, thanks a lot :)
[negative]	[15:21]	<jburd>	That's because I have other machines and I'd like to move new packages to the apt-cacher server
[neutral]	[15:21]	<cal_>	sly: a bug specificly for 6910p? or ATI drivers?
[negative]	[15:21]	<vwbusguy->	does Ubuntu 8.04 support ext4?  and if so how can I upgrade my fs from ext3?
[negative]	[15:21]	<dishayu>	i get a (initramfs) screen while trying to install/use live cd of hardy...  c2d e6300,msi p965 neo, 2 GB dd2 667 , Geforce 7300GT 512MB... what do i do?
[positive]	[15:21]	<ddrplayer512>	bazhang: Yeah, I know. But I figured that the repos would be flooded, and I wanted Hardy NOW. So... :)
[negative]	[15:21]	<jburd>	vwbusguy-: Don't unless you're experimenting with the kernel.
[neutral]	[15:22]	<qryzy>	my friend has installed it but it wont browse or see other pc on the network
[positive]	[15:22]	<amenado>	vwbusguy--> you have to compile your kernel to support such new file system
[neutral]	[15:22]	<W8TAH>	when doing a dual boot install, one should install windows first, correct???
[neutral]	[15:22]	<slytherin>	cal_: some hp laptop enable to boot. not sure of it is same as your problem
[negative]	[15:22]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: when i change my MAC id then i can't even ping my gateway
[positive]	[15:22]	<bakom>	hey, I updated to ubuntu 8.04 and now my screen resolution is somehow strange.. everything is too large, so that I can see only a part of my desktop and now menu to change the resolution, what can I do?
[neutral]	[15:22]	<ddrplayer512>	W8TAH: Yes
[positive]	[15:22]	<W8TAH>	thanks
[neutral]	[15:22]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: aha! good point then
[neutral]	[15:22]	<nibsa1242b>	snadge: is that working for you?
[negative]	[15:22]	<amenado>	qryzy-> you have to be clearer on what the problem is, detail or elaborate your network layout
[negative]	[15:22]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: What is the original problem?
[negative]	[15:22]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: so we just need to restart networking maybe
[negative]	[15:23]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: but i did that too
[negative]	[15:23]	<cal_>	sly: hmm lauchpad is a sourceforge clone?
[negative]	[15:23]	<vwbusguy->	So ext4 is not supported in 8.04?
[positive]	[15:23]	<ddrplayer512>	The rule of thumb is... Older versions of Windows to Newer Versions, then other OSes like Ubuntu/Linux, FreeBSD, etc.
[neutral]	[15:23]	<slytherin>	bakom: At the login screen I think you have an option for some recovery.
[negative]	[15:23]	<amenado>	bakom  try  crtl+alt+ +  the last + is the plus in the numeric keypad
[neutral]	[15:23]	<nabil2199>	I'm having trouble getting gutsy to upgrade the upgrade manager is unable to download the upgrade tool
[neutral]	[15:23]	<slytherin>	cal_: no
[negative]	[15:23]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: let me provide a recap to you.
[positive]	[15:23]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: err, yes, but it didnt work, and it probably should have :)
[negative]	[15:23]	<andycaass>	What was the program that enabled you to see cpu temps on app bar?
[negative]	[15:23]	<bakom>	slytherin, I don't see the login screen when starting up
[positive]	[15:23]	<snadge>	nibsa1242b: cheers that worked thanks :)
[positive]	[15:23]	<rohan>	"bazhang: aha, the ""usb"" factoid helped me.. thanks for the pointer"
[positive]	[15:23]	<amenado>	nabil2199->  -> -> the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[negative]	[15:23]	<slytherin>	bakom: then how do you login?
[neutral]	[15:23]	<Eren>	hi
[negative]	[15:23]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I can't be bothered to scroll up and read everything.  can you restate your original problem?
[negative]	[15:23]	<un2him>	anyone having problems with gnome-do?
[negative]	[15:23]	<vwbusguy->	amenado, so ext4 is not supported in 8.04?
[negative]	[15:23]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes please i working 3 probs in 4 channels here lol
[negative]	[15:23]	<nibsa1242b>	nabil2199: the servers are swamped, give them a few hours or days and then try again
[positive]	[15:23]	<nabil2199>	thanks amenado
[neutral]	[15:24]	<tomd123>	vwbusguy-: no
[negative]	[15:24]	<spiniker>	nabil u should try it in the terminal.
[negative]	[15:24]	<slytherin>	un2him: what kind of problem?

[negative]	[15:24]	<un2him>	slytherin: wont open urls in firefox...does nothing
[neutral]	[15:24]	<amenado>	vwbusguy--> you can verify by checking the /boot/config* file  grep it for ext4 if supported..i already advised you to recompile the kernel
[positive]	[15:24]	<jburd>	So I can move it to my apt-cacher server
[positive]	[15:24]	<bakom>	is there a way to change the screen resolution via console?
[positive]	[15:25]	<amenado>	bakom-> try the crtrl+alt  -   (minus) several times, but be patient, pause between presses
[neutral]	[15:25]	<nabil2199>	the upgrade tool(hardy.gz) cannot be downloaded by the update_manager but using wget i got it
[negative]	[15:25]	<gkhnoisgtht>	just a quick question is there anyway to make a live cd ubuntu server that automatically sets up a raid 5 configuration and samba
[negative]	[15:25]	<gord_>	jburd: maybe he just needs if up after macchange...we'll see
[negative]	[15:25]	<slytherin>	bakom: Ok. do one thing. Open terminal from Applications->Accessories. Do 'sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[negative]	[15:25]	<bazhang>	elektronik123: then just go back when they do

[neutral]	[15:28]	<ad>	P0larBear, ubuntu.com has google analytis enabled
[negative]	[15:28]	<roychri>	The connection has timed out.  The server at archive.ubuntu.com is taking too long to respond.
[positive]	[15:28]	<slytherin>	sdakak: if you are already on ubuntu the command is 'md5sum filename.iso' and then compare it against the one available on website
[negative]	[15:28]	<bakom>	slytherin, I did that (with .bak.conf) ... I'm currently rebooting....
[neutral]	[15:28]	<amenado>	bakom then you have to proly fiddle with /etc/X11/xorg.conf file
[negative]	[15:28]	<murlidhar>	still no support for my all in one epson stylus cx2800 :(
[negative]	[15:28]	<bazhang>	sdakak: you want me to search for it?

[neutral]	[15:29]	<bazhang>	!codecs | HayHay
[positive]	[15:29]	<ubotu>	HayHay: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: @HLINK - See also @HLINK - But please use free formats if you can: @HLINK
[neutral]	[15:29]	<sdakak>	slytherin: bazhang: I am looking for the md5sum of the ubuntu-8.04-dvd-i380-iso which is nowhere to be found. It is the DVD
[positive]	[15:29]	<slytherin>	lyroy: it may not be freeze actually, be patient, have a coffee break. If it still doesn't work, file a bug. :-)
[positive]	[15:29]	<P0larBear>	the right codecs to download ubuntu 8.04?
[negative]	[15:29]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Which ISP is this?  And why are you changing your MAC?
[neutral]	[15:29]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	is the server for downloading the respotories naturally slow?
[neutral]	[15:30]	<murlidhar>	P0larBear, there is add on paenl thingy than can control the brightness of the moniter
[positive]	[15:30]	<bakom>	slytherin, thanks, It's working :)
[positive]	[15:30]	<amenado>	mib_5klyf1zq->  the server side is busy, you may have the perception it is busy and unresponsive..
[positive]	[15:30]	<bazhang>	mib_5klyf1zq: the day after release yes
[negative]	[15:30]	<P0larBear>	murlidhar any idea of the name?
[negative]	[15:30]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	ah i see...
[negative]	[15:30]	<HayHay>	ok - for tip on search for codecs. thx
[negative]	[15:30]	<P0larBear>	it'd be nice to have the keyboard working, but maybe i can get that app to use the keys
[negative]	[15:30]	<gkhnoisgtht>	just a quick question is there anyway to make a live cd ubuntu server that automatically sets up a raid 5 configuration and samba
[neutral]	[15:30]	<ampex>	is @HLINK down?
[neutral]	[15:31]	<murlidhar>	P0larBear, right-click on the panel and select brightness control
[negative]	[15:31]	<slytherin>	P0larBear: brigheness control won't work if there is problem the way your laptop's ACPI works. Better file a bug
[negative]	[15:31]	<bazhang>	gkhnoisgtht: the server is install only not live
[neutral]	[15:31]	<indian_munnda>	jburd: i m having two computer systems when i try to run net in the other one it does not working because MAC is registered to the ISP server.
[negative]	[15:31]	<slytherin>	ampex: that mirror is always known to have problems. I wonder why is it even included in mirror lists
[neutral]	[15:31]	<gkhnoisgtht>	could the desktop version be configured as such?
[positive]	[15:31]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I think it's a bit fast in here.  you can /join ##linux-india I guess.
[negative]	[15:31]	<amenado>	gkhnoisgtht-> i dont think debian-installer preseed support raid 5 yet, but i could be wrong or didnt pay attention to that details as i dont have the need for it
[negative]	[15:31]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: at a commandline please do -   sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart after u ise machanger, let me know if that reports any errors
[neutral]	[15:31]	<toxic_>	#ubuntu-fr
[negative]	[15:31]	<mlw1>	is it plausible that installing nvidia 96 drivers would fix my problem with resolution changing?
[negative]	[15:31]	<tristanbob>	does hardy include open office 3, or a beta of it?
[neutral]	[15:31]	<bazhang>	gkhnoisgtht: sure; just add lamp
[negative]	[15:32]	<slytherin>	indian_munnda: which ridiculous ISP is that?

[neutral]	[15:32]	<ampex>	slytherin: have a good replacement for me?
[negative]	[15:32]	<Theo_>	why does it say my ati fire gl is not in use if i enabled it?
[positive]	[15:32]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yes a slower channel will be a lot more help i think, its more of a generla linux - webby-hosting - mac-spoofing question too
[neutral]	[15:32]	<tononoinks>	anybody know how to get the mic working
[negative]	[15:32]	<slytherin>	ampex: can't say. I am not in US.
[negative]	[15:32]	<JohnMM>	indian_munnda, comcast does that too ...use a router
[negative]	[15:32]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I guessed so.  You probably have a static IP address bound to your MAC by your ISP's gateway.
[negative]	[15:32]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i did the same as you said and it even stopped pinging my ISP srver
[negative]	[15:32]	<ampex>	slytherin: is there a list somewhere?
[positive]	[15:32]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The best solution is to use a router and tell them to use the hardware address of the router.
[negative]	[15:32]	<Frijolie>	does Hardy have Compiz or Compiz-Fusion installed, how do you check?
[neutral]	[15:33]	<edugonch_>	7join #ubuntu-devel
[neutral]	[15:33]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Then connect both computers to the router (using a switch if required)
[positive]	[15:33]	<slytherin>	ampex: you will have to search. There is definitely a list on wiki.ubuntu.com or launchpad.net. Search for word 'mirror'
[neutral]	[15:33]	<edugonch_>	7join #ubuntu-dev
[negative]	[15:33]	<roychri>	slytherin: I changed, hit reload, and it complained about some files not found.
[positive]	[15:33]	<JohnMM>	jburd, my router supports mac address spoofing hehe so I just had it spoof the mac address of my computer and all is good :D
[negative]	[15:33]	<bazhang>	gnome does ues Frijolie the basic stuff
[neutral]	[15:33]	<tononoinks>	anybody know how to get the mic working?
[neutral]	[15:33]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: hmmmmm. did it say anything about DHCP discovers?
[neutral]	[15:33]	<indian_munnda>	jburd: yes you r write its a static ip
[neutral]	[15:33]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The other solution is to set up the already configured machine as a proxy for the other machine.
[negative]	[15:33]	<Frijolie>	bazhang: huh?
[neutral]	[15:33]	<slytherin>	roychri: which files?
[negative]	[15:33]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	whats the best video editor for linux? or is it better to just use virtualbox and install adobe premiere on windows?
[positive]	[15:33]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: bridge both network interfaces one to wan and the other to lan
[neutral]	[15:34]	<roychri>	PAckages.gz
[neutral]	[15:34]	<roychri>	slytherin: Packages.gz
[negative]	[15:34]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: MAC spoofing isn't a very ideal solution.
[negative]	[15:34]	<slytherin>	mib_5klyf1zq: you may want to try kino or pitivi
[neutral]	[15:34]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	wat about cinelerra?
[neutral]	[15:34]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: a switch will cost you somewhere around 900 bucks INR.
[neutral]	[15:34]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yeah far simpler if other machine is still working
[neutral]	[15:34]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i m running DNS server
[negative]	[15:34]	<cvw>	I cannot perform updates against @HLINK, however, I can ping it just fine.  Is this a known issue?
[neutral]	[15:34]	<tolonuga>	anyone speeking french here? I got a bug report (221856 at launchpad.net), but because of the french locale I don't understand it. if anyone could translate it for me, that would be nice.
[positive]	[15:34]	<mrTr0ut>	okay, so I just installed 8.04 to a ext3 partition but it never modified the boot record and I only have the option to boot into xp
[positive]	[15:34]	<bazhang>	cvw: the servers are overloaded at the moment
[neutral]	[15:34]	<Pilha>	hello ev'ryone
[negative]	[15:35]	<roychri>	cvw: Too many people upgrading. Use a local server/mirror
[negative]	[15:35]	<indian_munnda>	jburd: you mean to use a hub
[neutral]	[15:35]	<Heroin>	anyone here use or used conceal?
[negative]	[15:35]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ah yes u did say, i no expert on that , but it might comlicate
[negative]	[15:35]	<amenado>	mrTr0ut-> then what are you waiting for? modify it to suit your new install
[negative]	[15:35]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: No.  I mean use a switch.   Not a hub.
[negative]	[15:35]	<Pilha>	ahaa, before even asking I have my answer
[positive]	[15:35]	<cvw>	roychri: your comment is unhelpful without a link to a list that can provide local servers or mirrors.
[positive]	[15:35]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The best solution is to use a router with your ISP.
[neutral]	[15:35]	<HayHay>	P0larBear: What player comes up when you select a song to listen to?
[positive]	[15:35]	<roychri>	cvw: The list is in synaptic.

[positive]	[15:36]	<bazhang>	cvw: use synaptic to change mirrors and go easy on the volunteers here thanks

[negative]	[16:02]	<amenado>	OllieA-> it should be the same as in gutsy? lest you changed your hardware
[negative]	[16:02]	<Turms_gutsy>	mosno: ok, i never had the need to use luks, so you may be right, but for a normal user (as the 99% are) there is no need to have /boot in a separate partition

[negative]	[16:03]	<nibsa1242b>	OllieA: lspci | grep [ati, nvidia, intel, etc] or just lspci if the manufacturer name doesn't show up
[negative]	[16:03]	<red_>	wow, installing dependencies for limewire pro eats up all cores of my core 2 duo e4600 cpu..and my system is not sending packets to the net. is this a bug?
[negative]	[16:03]	<CaptainMorgan>	I see a bug wasn't fixed in Hardy- I have a top panel that is set to not expand, top and hide upon hitting a button... upon a system restart, from 7.04 to now 8.04 that panel when started is directly above the bottom panel- to get it back into position, the same sequence of steps need to be followed EVERY time. Right Click panel > Check Expand > Select Top > Check Expand again(so that it now doesn't expand) any ideas why this
[negative]	[16:03]	<CaptainMorgan>	 wasn't fixed ?
[negative]	[16:03]	<Kcaj>	Hey guys!

[neutral]	[16:03]	<bazhang>	askand: this is not the channel to ask in
[negative]	[16:03]	<El1>	darren_: just try killall pulseaudio and see if firefox still crashes when you're trying to view a video
[neutral]	[16:03]	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: is that the same as sectors? cause I got a tiny partition that refuses to die
[neutral]	[16:03]	<mosno>	Turms_gutsy: /boot is also handy if you decide to get rid of Ubuntu but you want your bootloader to not break (you just leave /boot alone)
[negative]	[16:03]	<Kcaj>	Is there a good IRC Daemon for Ubuntu I can get with SYnaptics?
[positive]	[16:03]	<Kcaj>	Especially if it is easy to set up

[negative]	[16:03]	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: maybe that's what's causing the error
[negative]	[16:03]	<mosno>	Turms_gutsy: apart from that i don't think i've had a real need for a separate /boot
[negative]	[16:03]	<CaptainMorgan>	amenado, it's quite annoying...
[neutral]	[16:03]	<bazhang>	because we are not the bug triagers askand

[neutral]	[16:04]	<sipior>	mem_oro_76: might be, but a bit odd that you can't destroy the partition. does it have a special type?
[negative]	[16:04]	<amenado>	CaptainMorgan-> or wait til someone have time to work on it
[negative]	[16:04]	<leprasmurf>	so how many reports have there been of nvidia drivers screwing up now?
[negative]	[16:04]	<OllieA>	How do I install a graphics card driver?

[neutral]	[16:05]	<nlindblad>	OllieA: Know how to check?
[neutral]	[16:05]	<sipior>	andycr: try another mirror...
[negative]	[16:05]	<darren_>	ok the video is playing verry choppy
[negative]	[16:05]	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: the servers are swamped... if you let it sit there for an hour or so it'll probably unfreeze
[negative]	[16:05]	<nlindblad>	OllieA: Try lspci and see if the kernel recognises it
[neutral]	[16:05]	<amenado>	gnychis->    the server side is extremely busy, you may have the perception it is unresponsive and not working..
[negative]	[16:05]	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: it says filesystem unknown - it was formatted as hfs+ before but all I want to do is wipe it completely so I can make a new partition
[negative]	[16:05]	<andycr>	sipior: A mirror for apt? I'm not sure how I would add a mirror to sources.list.
[neutral]	[16:05]	<ushaba>	i'm debating a clean install

[negative]	[16:06]	<gnychis>	amenado: nibsa1242b: i see... is it possible to upgrade via bittorrent?
[positive]	[16:06]	<gribouille>	does ubuntu support itanium ?
[neutral]	[16:06]	<amenado>	ushaba dont include us in your debate,
[neutral]	[16:06]	<ushaba>	i'll do some research on getting wireless working from the commandline first
[negative]	[16:06]	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: Linux can't read hfs+ fully, but without the journal it should work

[positive]	[16:06]	<ubotu>	RoiG: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of the latest edition. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[neutral]	[16:06]	<OllieA>	nlindblad: PMed you
[negative]	[16:06]	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: If you just want to format it with another filesystem that is easy
[negative]	[16:07]	<Turms_gutsy>	mosno: as for the bootloader, well, it is not a problem, i have a floppy disk for it, to be frank in 10 yrs i did not see the need to have /boot in a separate partition, i have /home/myuser/documents in a separate partition so i can share it with different distro's
[negative]	[16:07]	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: you could torrent the alt install CD (or the desktop / alt install DVD) however, I was told if you go that route packages that aren't on the cd/dvd could break during upgrade
[neutral]	[16:07]	<daemon3>	Are the servers usually overloaded for Ubuntu?
[negative]	[16:07]	<techqbert>	I have 51 packages held back up apt-get upgrade, no worries?
[negative]	[16:07]	<Kcaj>	Is there a good IRC Daemon for Ubuntu I can get with SYnaptics?
[neutral]	[16:07]	<techqbert>	daemon3: No.
[neutral]	[16:07]	<mem_oro_76>	nlindblad: i know but I don't even want it to, I want a clean slate so I can format ext3 and fat32 but, this tiny partition won't go away
[positive]	[16:07]	<gribouille>	does ubuntu support itanium ?
[negative]	[16:07]	<sipior>	andycr: just edit the sources.list to point at another mirror. i think there's also a command-line program to do this, though the name currently escapes me.
[negative]	[16:07]	<leprasmurf>	hello all, I've attempted to upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04, my nvidia drivers crapped out on me.  I had to revert to the legacy drivers.  is there some new proceedure that I don't know about?

[negative]	[16:08]	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: I will tell you that after the system updated sat for about 20min looking like it was dead, it started functioning properly for me, and with my local mirror it looks like I'll be done downloading everything I need with a total time of under two hours

[negative]	[16:09]	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: fdisk could then re-create the partition table and let you make differently sized partitions
[negative]	[16:09]	<dystopianray>	kernando: yes you can, but i don't think network-manager supports it
[neutral]	[16:09]	<bazhang>	kernando: not practically
[negative]	[16:09]	<nlindblad>	mem_oro_76: Which you could then put filesystems on
[neutral]	[16:09]	<CaptainMorgan>	it's reversed in my situation- I'm surprised nobody noticed it earlier... that bug report is for this month
[neutral]	[16:09]	<Nith>	is there a way to md5sum a directory recursively?

[positive]	[16:09]	<amenado>	CaptainMorgan-> alright..keep the person on the other end happy, send em cookies and pizza..hehe
[negative]	[16:09]	<RoiG>	amenado -> because when updating from the CD you can select if install the updated packets from internet or use the ones from CD?

[neutral]	[16:46]	<O||y>	Hi all
[negative]	[16:46]	<CyberCod>	it sucks because it attempts to make something easier and just ends up making a mess of the whole process.... selecting your time zone should be a simple drop down box.  And if you MUST include a zoomable map, put a dropdown box for timezone next to it... or highlight a vertical stripe of the map with which timezone is currently selected so that you can tell if your city happens to fall within it.

[positive]	[18:06]	<ddrplayer512>	SimplePlan: The Desktop CD is usually the best choice for doing a fresh install.
[positive]	[18:06]	<Koheleth>	valchers: go to the software manager and search for qt, then scroll down a bit and mark qt-dev-tools
[neutral]	[18:06]	<SimplePlan>	DBautell im installing

[negative]	[18:07]	<bullium>	oh ok...you can use the alternate CD for the upgrade I believe
[neutral]	[18:07]	<DBautell>	SimplePlan, than you can use either, I believe the alternate is text mode only, though
[negative]	[18:07]	<lopin>	"duaneb stops doing anything at ""Checking Package Manager"" and the window goes gray"

[positive]	[18:07]	<ddrplayer512>	SimplePlan: The alternate install is good if you like text installs, and you are familiar with it. The alternate CD is also good to kickstart an upgrade.
[positive]	[18:07]	<manawenuz>	amenado: there's no Ubuntu client , except mine :) i'm trying to connect to 213.217.55.30 client with ubuntu and i'm unable to

[negative]	[18:07]	<SimplePlan>	DBautell then i shudnt check that box?
[positive]	[18:07]	<manawenuz>	amenado: but with windows it's fine
[positive]	[18:07]	<lopin>	duaneb: does it with the alt cd as well...
[neutral]	[18:07]	<evand>	fysa: yikes!  Resolved now though?
[negative]	[18:07]	<wild_oscar>	and when I send a file from my WM5 device to ubuntu, bluez says it received it but I have no idea where it was saved!
[neutral]	[18:08]	<amenado>	manawenuz-> from the drawing is it in the internet cloud? the 192.168.0.x cloud?
[neutral]	[18:08]	<duaneb>	"lopin, go to the terminal and type ""sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"""
[negative]	[18:08]	<pjoul>	Noah0504: okay, but it's not worth that troubles
[negative]	[18:08]	<vignesh>	bullium, how do i do that?
[negative]	[18:08]	<duaneb>	lopin, I'd guess that the mirrors are just slow
[negative]	[18:08]	<usicow>	since upgrading to 8.04 compiz crashes.. has anyone else had any problems?

[neutral]	[18:08]	<Noah0504>	pjoul: Thanks for the heads up.

[negative]	[18:08]	<LetoThe2nd>	hi! is it possible to have dual-heads on a nvidia card with ubuntu?
[positive]	[18:08]	<DBautell>	SimplePlan, I would say probably not, the regular disc will be more comfortable
[negative]	[18:08]	<lopin>	duaneb, the local seems to be going faster...

[negative]	[18:08]	<manawenuz>	amenado: i'll ask it someother how
[positive]	[18:08]	<duaneb>	lopin, good :)
[negative]	[18:08]	<vignesh>	wild_oscar, it will be saved in desktop by default..

If I try click the upgrade to 8.04 button again it gets stuck on the downloading the upgrade tool screen

[negative]	[18:46]	<milly123>	ok, even since I upgraded to hardy my wireless insternet connection and signal have been terrible, I even have terrible lag just being connected to this irc server, is there something different about how it handles this that I can put back to how gutsy did it? I'm not even sure if you all are going to get this question because it is jumping up and down from 20 second lags or more

[neutral]	[20:55]	<Administrator_>	hi.. I had a PCMCIA Buffalo WLI-CB-G54 up and running on Gutsy Gibbon by enabling the restricted drivers.. but as I upgraded to Hardy Heron, the list on Hardware Drivers is just empty. I proceeded to Hardware testing, and it rightly detects a BCM4318 [AirForce One 54g] Wireless controller, but the lights on the PCMCIA card are not on. Can anyone please help?
[neutral]	[20:55]	<joshua__>	yes

[negative]	[21:55]	<Jeah>	I'm having a weird Window Manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy.  Xfce4-terminal is opening without window decorations.  It has the right shape, but instead of the title bar, frame, close button, etc it is just solid black.  I can click where the buttons should be and they work, but they're not visible.  Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  I tried re-downloading and re-installing the xfc
[negative]	[21:55]	<drivetrax>	|jess|:  all you need.. is there.  is it Dual Boot You Want?

[negative]	[21:55]	<fbc>	amenado, no it can't be standard as there was a utility in gutsy and feisty.. I just don't understand why it was demoted or something..
[negative]	[21:55]	<ceil420>	jPratt, the only reason i'm even upgrading is so i can update libconfuse
[neutral]	[21:55]	<jPratt>	lol
[negative]	[21:55]	<adiabatic>	cl: does the alternate version install an X server, or should I try xubuntu?

[negative]	[21:56]	<cl>	adiabatic, i put the regular version on a Sempron 3000 with 256MB once. Took 2 hrs to install and was dog slow
[neutral]	[21:57]	<PKsteR>	ptn107: yes the are installed
[negative]	[21:57]	<meoblast001>	i want to upgrade throught Gutsy to Hardy
[positive]	[21:57]	<ceil420>	Firefox was still at 2.0.0.9 when i switched to Linux :p
[positive]	[21:57]	<lindo>	Does wubi negatively impact performance at all?
[positive]	[21:57]	<amenado>	gpled so be happy, what is the complaint?
[neutral]	[21:57]	<gpled>	thought bittorents solved the load problem years ago
[negative]	[21:57]	<ibleed>	"i installed a gnome icon theme.  despite having installed it all icons changed except for folder icons.  the folder icons instead of switching went to ""standard gnome"" icons.  how can i fix ?"

[negative]	[21:57]	<cl>	lindo, the bigger probl is that you can't mount your windows drive though.
[negative]	[21:57]	<dystopianray>	gpled: apt doesn't work over bittorrent though
[neutral]	[21:57]	<amenado>	gpled-> i already told you the servers are extremely busy, just be patient

[negative]	[21:58]	<gpled>	dystopianray: should i add a close server to download?
[neutral]	[21:58]	<needcdrom>	hey alls, my computer won't let me update from gutsy to hardy for some reason

[negative]	[21:58]	<chubs730>	lindo: you can also install ubuntu and not change the mbr, and use a usb boot stick
[positive]	[21:58]	<drivetrax>	lindo:  unetbootin - is a network via internet install that will partition and make MBR
[negative]	[21:58]	<lindo>	gotcha, and you'd consider that preferable to a boot cd or some such?
[negative]	[21:58]	<dystopianray>	sarah_bear: make sure you have this packaged installed: libk3b2-mp3
[negative]	[21:58]	<|jess|>	drivetrax: I already have 2 distros and wanted to add ubuntu.

[neutral]	[21:59]	<cl>	GNUtoo, hello
[neutral]	[21:59]	<sarah_bear>	I already have that installed dystopianray
[positive]	[21:59]	<lindo>	Thanks chubs, drivetrax, I'll look into both
[negative]	[21:59]	<sarah_bear>	anything else i need?
[negative]	[21:59]	<DaaT>	also, when booting from hardy's CD, it gets to the first screen (after choosing install), the language select screen, but can't advance. Cursor moves but doesn't clic, keyboard navigation doesn't work as well. It's the same thing when booting into 8.04 after updating from 7.10, using the latest kernel version
[negative]	[21:59]	<ceil420>	needcdrom, when i got that message, i had broken packages. the error message should have given you a directory to some logs; look at the latter part of those logs and see what packages are causing the problem, and remove them manually
[negative]	[21:59]	<csais>	what do you mean with trolling?
[negative]	[21:59]	<cl>	adiabatic, very slow. i put another 256MB in and it was much better.
[negative]	[21:59]	<dystopianray>	sarah_bear: what problem are you having with k3b then?
[neutral]	[21:59]	<strtok>	Anyone have an issue with 8.04's titlebars turning purple/rainbow every once in a while? They correct themselves if you click on the window
[negative]	[21:59]	<cl>	adiabatic, i wouldn't recommend it.
[neutral]	[21:59]	<Jeah>	Can anyone help me with a weird window manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy?
[neutral]	[21:59]	<gpled>	wa hoo, look at it fly
[negative]	[21:59]	<|jess|>	drivetrax: I did choose to install the Ubuntu bootloader in the same partition as the installation because I didn't want ubuntu to change my grub setup
[neutral]	[21:59]	<ptn107>	strtok: yes
[neutral]	[21:59]	<cl>	adiabatic, even WinXP was faster
[negative]	[21:59]	<ChrisVP>	I'm trying to install some drivers, and getting the message that us.archives.ubuntu.com isn't resolving.  Is that standard behavior?  Will it be resolved soon?
[negative]	[21:59]	<CyberCod>	didja all hear about the new Apple product?  its just like the iPhone, except that they gave it an honest name... its called the iBroken
[negative]	[21:59]	<needcdrom>	ceil420: thank you thank you! that's the kind of thing I needed to know
[negative]	[22:00]	<drivetrax>	I found that using a certain ATI Video card.. the drivers were better with the Ubuntu OS.. I just do not have Catalyst.. and video tweaks
[negative]	[22:00]	<amenado>	Daat do you have an existing 7.10 running? would you like to try and boot the downloaded 8.04 iso from hd?
[neutral]	[22:00]	<dystopianray>	amenado: of course he's not trolling, he wants to know where his windows partition is mounted within ubuntu
[negative]	[22:00]	<strtok>	ptn107: any idea what causes it?
[negative]	[22:00]	<gpled>	central control of downloads is a bad idea

[negative]	[22:00]	<ptn107>	strtok: i thought maybe my binary nvidia drivers. but even without them it still happens (even on my laptop)
[negative]	[22:00]	<giggsey>	Is there anyway to stop pulseaudio crashing when I log into gdm?
[negative]	[22:00]	<sarah_bear>	hmm dystopianray i can't play a mp3 using totem movie player

[neutral]	[22:15]	<Bubble_tea>	amenado, hwilde it only allow one default language for user..
[negative]	[22:16]	<chubs730>	if anyone else is aware of problems (joshua?) for specific apps do speak up
[negative]	[22:16]	<hwilde>	plik, ok I didn't think to use rsync duhh
[negative]	[22:16]	<ravi_>	I have a UPS. Ubuntu displays the remaining charge correctly, but does not hibernate at the set critical point. I have checked the settings and they are OK. What could be the problem? This happens in Gutsy, Hardy as well.
[negative]	[22:16]	<joshua__>	steve i would definitly say go 64 if you are doing development work, i think you can handle installing a couple libraries
[positive]	[22:16]	<instantsoup>	i have a weird problem with pidgin. When i try to add an icq account it tells me the screen name must start with a letter/must be an email.  But it should be the icq number, right? And it shows the AIM symbol in the account manager
[positive]	[22:16]	<noodlesgc>	jbur2 because otherwise it will turn you into a server
[neutral]	[22:16]	<Starnestommy>	"Wirta-: hit alt+f2, enter ""xkill"", then click on the frozen window"

[negative]	[22:17]	<EruditeHermit>	hey, I tried upgrading to hardy, but the upgrade failed and when I try to login, I get a brown background. However, I am able to login via console. When I login with console, and try to do apt-get upgrade or apt-get -f install it says that dpkg-divert rename involves overwriting /sbin/depmod with different file, not allowed.

[negative]	[22:18]	<Jeah>	Can anybody help me with a weird window manager problem in Xubuntu Hardy?  Xfce4-terminal is opening without window decorations.  It has the right shape, but instead of the title bar, frame, close button, etc it is just solid black.  I can click where the buttons should be and they work, but they're not visible.  Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  Compositing is off.  I tried re-do
[neutral]	[22:18]	<instantsoup>	like i said, i add or modify the account, choose icq and add everything, then i save it and it shows the account in the account manager as ICQ but with the AIM symbol next to it
[positive]	[22:18]	<nonewmsgs>	nickrober: sweet :)
[negative]	[22:18]	<daemon3>	Yesterday I tried to install Hardy, but I quit a little after I started downloading the packages.  No actual installs took place.  Now my update manager doesn't say I need to upgrade.  I tried apt-get clean, aptitude clearn, apt-get autoclean, and aptitude autoclean, but I still get the same resutls.  Why do you think this is?
[negative]	[22:18]	<dubby>	hey anyone does hardy have a samba configuration gui?

[positive]	[22:22]	<drivetrax>	remember Hardy is not an update,, it is an Upgrade
[neutral]	[22:22]	<noodlesgc>	daemon3 try sudo update-manager -d
[positive]	[22:22]	<jbur2>	I digress.  Hardy is a clean install.
[neutral]	[22:22]	<Scunizi>	nuSharper: the DVD has ubutnu, kubuntu, xubuntu and related packages.. but not any more than what you would normally get if picking one of the versions and downloading the livecd
[negative]	[22:22]	<daemon3>	|DuReX|: I did about 90 times.  I tried apt-get update, apt-get upgrade, apt-get dist upgrade, and combinations with aptitude.  I even tried apt-get/aptitude clean/autoclean.
[neutral]	[22:22]	<ravi_>	Is the kernel clocksource (tsc/hpet) problem solved in hardy?
[positive]	[22:23]	<Jeah>	daemon3: Are you talking about security/recommended updates or the upgrade to Hardy?  It won't pop up a notification icon for the distro upgrade, you'll see that if you open update manager manually.  At the top it should say that a new version is available and give you the option of upgrading.
[negative]	[22:23]	<cardstroker>	I'm a newby  and need some help.  right now at the command line it keeps trying to update and cannot connect, how do i stop it?
[negative]	[22:23]	<daemon3>	drivetrax: I know.  I make a mistake of using them interchangeably.

[neutral]	[22:25]	<drivetrax>	Skipping versions is not advised and can cause a lot of damage to your installation.
[positive]	[22:25]	<ravi_>	"daemon3,  check the ""Updates"" tab in Software Sources system settings"
[negative]	[22:25]	<nuSharper>	another question, a given program that, when installed in Ubuntu, works out of the box without the need of extra configuration (due to codecs, let's say), would also work straight after the installation in Xubuntu?
[neutral]	[22:25]	<lunartear>	i have public key access working from user_x@host1 to userx@host2, but using the same public key on user_y@host2  goes directly to password auth, The key is silently failing for user_y?

[neutral]	[22:25]	<daemon3>	ubotu2: I've followed those directions.
[negative]	[22:26]	<hwilde>	mistapapa, pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file please
[neutral]	[22:26]	<drivetrax>	If you are using an earlier version, and want to 'skip' a version, the only safe way is to backup your data and do a fresh install, or to progressively upgrade to each successive version.
[negative]	[22:26]	<noodlesgc>	nuSharper it should. the only way to be completely sure is to try
[positive]	[22:26]	<hwilde>	lunartear, ssh -vvv    it will show you verbose output

[negative]	[22:26]	<daemon3>	chubs730: I know, it should.  But it doesn't.
[negative]	[22:26]	<noodlesgc>	drivetrax i thought they made it possible to upgrade between LTS's
[negative]	[22:26]	<drivetrax>	The LTS version is recommended for people in an environment (generally commercial/industrial) that want to keep the same version for a longer amount of time and do not require newer/faster/updated versions, but instead do not want things to change.

[negative]	[23:32]	<unop>	Veinor, you can use an ISO offline like that sure, but it needs to be an alternate CD ISO not the normal live CD

[neutral]	[23:33]	<psych>	hwilde, got it?
[negative]	[23:33]	<DBautell>	To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'

[negative]	[23:34]	<Veinor>	DaveG|: what do you mean 'download all the files'?
[neutral]	[23:34]	<kbrooks>	cronix, then initrd /boot/<replace this with pressing the tab key>

[neutral]	[23:34]	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: boot to it
[negative]	[23:34]	<hwilde>	szenti, if you want to.  it's a personal preference

[positive]	[23:34]	<DaveG|>	KooperKool, i don't want to burn a cd :P
[neutral]	[23:34]	<josh04>	kenan: try installing libflashsupport with synaptic
[neutral]	[23:34]	<kbrooks>	cronix, in kernel and initrd when you tab you need to look for the revelant files, eg vmlinuz
[negative]	[23:34]	<nucco>	hwilde: why won't you recommend it off-hand?
[negative]	[23:34]	<psych>	hwilde, ty, gonna test it
[neutral]	[23:34]	<Veinor>	daveg| download the alternate cd ISO and mount it loopback

[positive]	[23:35]	<KooperKool>	DaveG|: go to System--Administration--Update Manager
[negative]	[23:35]	<Tristam>	So anyone have ideas on why my sound is horribly distorted after the upgrade?  I've got an Nvidia MCP51 HDA
[negative]	[23:35]	<hwilde>	nucco, if you want to deal with that fine, it's not really much difference
[negative]	[23:36]	<evilbug>	"i upgraded to hardy via alternative cd and i had a bunch of errors on some components not being able to install.then i ran ""sudo apt-get -f install"" after reboot and now things work alright,but the grub boot menu is showing me 2 different ubuntu options.both are 8.04 but one is with the previous kernel and the first one is the current kernel."

[negative]	[23:36]	<nucco>	southafrikanse: check your ~/.firefox folder or wherever firefox hides its settings, you might find something deletable there

[neutral]	[23:37]	<southafrikanse>	nucco, if I unnistal and install mozilla again will that help?
[negative]	[23:37]	<hwilde>	nucco, or you could just copy youre /home directory it's really not that hard
[negative]	[23:37]	<unop>	roffe__, use the !pastebin

[neutral]	[23:52]	<Cpudan80>	pagoda: It is in there already
[positive]	[23:52]	<fxfitz>	"hwilde, Alright, well, the dhclient gave them six different ""dhcpdiscover eth0 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval"" and at the end it said ""no dhcpoffers received"""
[negative]	[23:52]	<zeeeee>	KooperKool, i have 2 machines, both ubuntu 7.10, both had problems upgrading to 8.04 (and they were different problems)
[negative]	[23:53]	<hwilde>	fxfitz, lan cable is unplugged, dsl modem needs rebooted, etc etc
[neutral]	[23:53]	<jaffarkelshac>	what video editors are there for hardy, that support ogg file format
[positive]	[23:53]	<drivetrax>	Steve^:  -- hover over the logical drive name you see, and hit enter
[negative]	[23:53]	<Steve^>	drivetrax, since you mention swap, is 2 gigs enough?
[negative]	[23:53]	<J-a-k-e>	"ripps: ubuntu 7.10, it's working alright the prob is it only just sounds ""ok"" to me. I'm quite picky with my sound, music sound as if the mids are exagerated and treble is flat cymbals and such sound as if they're in the background"
[negative]	[23:53]	<adinc>	can someone please tell me which kernel-version is the newest for hardy?
[negative]	[23:53]	<nucco>	"steve, delete ""/"" and ""/home"" then create a logical partition big enough to hold them both"
[neutral]	[23:53]	<n000b>	once i install xubuntu can i revert back to ubuntu?
[positive]	[23:53]	<B166erx>	seamus7 , also ( ;) ) , the Mount app ofthe task bar, lists 2 times, bothe my drives, on time as '300gig' mounted, and on time as 'Barracuda' 'not mounted' (same for the windows one)
[neutral]	[23:53]	<nucco>	Steve^: make the swap first though
[negative]	[23:53]	<Sindacious>	Could anyone tell me why I can't download packages -.-
[neutral]	[23:53]	<drivetrax>	nucco:  -- yes.. right
[negative]	[23:53]	<nucco>	"Steve^ delete ""/"" and ""/home"" then create a logical partition big enough to hold them both"
[neutral]	[23:53]	<seamus7>	B166erx ... have you looked in gconf editor ... I think it's listed in apps/nautilus/desktop ... make sure 'volumes visible' is checked
[neutral]	[23:53]	<jaffarkelshac>	adinc,  2.6.24-16
[negative]	[23:53]	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Okay, and you're sure that would be it? Because the modem is really hard to get to and I don't want them going into the attic if they don't have to (I already had them check the ethernet cable in the back of the computer)
[negative]	[23:54]	<B166erx>	ok
[neutral]	[23:54]	<Cpudan80>	Sindacious: the server is very slow - give it time
[negative]	[23:54]	<roffe__>	unop: I think I had checked that they were installed from the beginning, but I'll run your command now
[neutral]	[23:54]	<Cpudan80>	Sindacious: we just released 8.04 yesterday
[negative]	[23:54]	<doug2266778822>	moveax:  ah cool, i just uninstalled and reinstalled still getting same thing.
[neutral]	[23:54]	<hwilde>	fxfitz, are there more than one network cards?  like eth1 ?
[neutral]	[23:54]	<n000b>	once u install xubuntu can u revert back to ubuntu?
[negative]	[23:54]	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Nope
[negative]	[23:54]	<hwilde>	fxfitz, dhclient eth0   should get a dhcp address from whatever it's plugged into
[negative]	[23:54]	<drivetrax>	nucco:  -- I don't think the thing is too easy to see, but I hit enter on the logical disk name, and it started needing partitions
[negative]	[23:54]	<ripps>	J-a-k-e: Have checked in the Volume Control preferences for a Tone option. I had to enable Tone in my SBLive! 5.1 to mess with my Bass and Treble. Just turning Tone on improved sound quality.
[positive]	[23:54]	<adinc>	jaffarkelshac: can users expect newer kernel versions for hardy and will it be installed when saying dist-upgrade
[negative]	[23:54]	<Steve^>	"nucco, drivetrax, I make my 80 gig parition, Logical (it forces me to select a type, so I select ext3), hitting enter on it just gives the ""Edit parition"" box. Do I need to do this outside of the installer in gparted?"
[neutral]	[23:54]	<B166erx>	seamus7, Volume Visible was checked
[negative]	[23:54]	<seamus7>	B166erx just do ALT +F2 and type gconf ... then it's apps/nautilus/desktop
[negative]	[23:54]	<unop>	roffe__,  if thats the case, try this instead.  sudo apt-get install --reinstall libgtkmm-dev libsqlite3-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool
[negative]	[23:54]	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Alright, well it sounds good. Thanks a lot1
[neutral]	[23:54]	<hwilde>	"fxfitz, have them do ""sudo ifconfig eth0 down""  ""sudo ifconfig eth0 up""  ""sudo dhclient eth0"""
[negative]	[23:54]	<seamus7>	B166erx oh nevermind
[negative]	[23:54]	<moveax>	doug2266778822: I have this irssi session screened on a remote server, so if you like, keep checking back with me and I@ll let you know how I got on. Already got one reply, but it doesn't help.
[negative]	[23:55]	<fxfitz>	hwilde, Okay will do
[negative]	[23:55]	<KooperKool>	what happens if I Remove ubuntu-desktop?
[positive]	[23:55]	<jaffarkelshac>	adinc, usually gets installed by update manager
[negative]	[23:55]	<pmcclelland>	having trouble playing .mkv files they are running pretty choppy
[neutral]	[23:55]	<doug2266778822>	moveax: how i join the irrsi?
[negative]	[23:55]	<nucco>	do you already have some windows partitions?
[neutral]	[23:55]	<pmcclelland>	using nvidia proprietary drivers
[neutral]	[23:55]	<Joelito>	Hi, I notice the icon effect while pushing the icons on the upper panel of ubuntu hardy, can I enable that effect on the menu items?
[neutral]	[23:55]	<zeeeee>	hwilde, @HLINK
[negative]	[23:55]	<nucco>	Steve^ do you already have some windows partitions?
[neutral]	[23:55]	<pmcclelland>	8800 GT
[neutral]	[23:55]	<n000b>	once u install xubuntu can u revert back to ubuntu?
[neutral]	[23:55]	<hwilde>	Steve^, just use guided partitioning man!
[negative]	[23:55]	<adinc>	final version of hardy has been released, are the updates going to be less frequent now
[neutral]	[23:55]	<Steve^>	nucco, yup, a fat16 and a ntfs
[negative]	[23:55]	<thompa>	has there been an update since yesaterday?
[negative]	[23:55]	<drivetrax>	Steve^:  -- I believe it is saying.. do you want to make this an ext3 partition, and to do that you Edit the partition, and Make it a Partition of that type
[neutral]	[23:55]	<moveax>	doug2266778822: haha, you don't, it's an irc client.
[negative]	[23:56]	<moveax>	doug2266778822: btw, the gstreamer driver, i've just noticed, doesn't include dvd playback of encrypted dvds
[positive]	[23:56]	<nucco>	Steve^, those also count as part of the 4 maximum you can have.
[neutral]	[23:56]	<ripps>	brb
[neutral]	[23:56]	<Steve^>	nucco, yea, I know
[negative]	[23:56]	<zeeeee>	those are the errors i'm getting
[negative]	[23:56]	<Sindacious>	Cpudan80, obviously. I just updated to it, and I'm getting lag from nowhere, and I cannot install anything through the Add/Remove
[negative]	[23:56]	<nucco>	Steve^, so, you gotta delete all the linux partitions you have, and make them all inside a logical partition
[negative]	[23:56]	<zeeeee>	dpkg basically crashes with a failed assertion after a bunch of failed attempts to configure packages
[neutral]	[23:56]	<hwilde>	zeeeee, sudo apt-get install x11-xfs-utils
[neutral]	[23:57]	<Joelito>	anyone?
[positive]	[23:57]	<nucco>	Steve^ delete them all including the swap, then make a new logical partition with all the space, see what it gives you
[negative]	[23:57]	<Steve^>	"nucco, yea, but the tool won't let me make logical partitions. I'm going to try and make all swap, / and /home as ""logical"" and see if that works"
[neutral]	[23:57]	<thompa>	firefox is causing my screen to lock up
[negative]	[23:57]	<seamus7>	B166erx when I plug media cards in they get mounted twice ... so I don't know what's happening there
[neutral]	[23:57]	<nucco>	Steve^ you gotta delete the existing ones first, just leaving the two windows partitions you dont want to touch
[negative]	[23:57]	<doug2266778822>	moveax: ah ok
[neutral]	[23:58]	<zeeeee>	hwilde, that just tells me to run dpkg --configure -a
[positive]	[23:58]	<nucco>	Steve^ the logical partition also counts as part of the 4 maximum :)
[negative]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	Got a problem with intel pro wireless 3945 abg network adapter
[neutral]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	not seeing any networks
[negative]	[23:58]	<Steve^>	nucco, I  have the 80 gigs of free space. I select logical and it appears to just make it as a normal parition. There is nothing in the table to indicate it is logical
[neutral]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	suspected driver bug
[negative]	[23:58]	<hwilde>	"zeeeee, sorry that's way over my head.  you need to install those things that says ""Package x11-xfs-utils is not installed""  bcause the other things depend on it"
[negative]	[23:58]	<B166erx>	Seamus7 i think i'm trying to 'get it' ..Ubuntu, while trying to make it simple, just keep Frakkin up everything for old timers like me.  Instead of having to go in Fstab, create a folder in /media, ect...   Hardy auto mount and detect the drives...and simply name them 'Media  **gig'     , But since i upgraded, i still have the Fstab lines and all, maybe thats it..
[negative]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	i'm helping a guy out, his wireless isn't working, but there's no sensical reason for that
[positive]	[23:58]	<nucco>	Steve^ when you make logical, that gives you 3 partitions including the windows ones right?
[negative]	[23:59]	<hansengel>	Hi, I just updated to Hardy and for some reason the sound is REALLY quiet.
[positive]	[23:59]	<roffe__>	unop: I did both the commands you gave me now, and still an error: @HLINK
[positive]	[23:59]	<hansengel>	If I raise the volume to the highest it can go, it's a normal level
[negative]	[23:59]	<zeeeee>	hwilde, yeah, i read the messages too, but the upgrade process was completely hosed
[neutral]	[23:59]	<hansengel>	My speakers are as high as they can go also
[negative]	[23:59]	<nucco>	ethana2: explain the problem please, better chances of getting help that way
[neutral]	[23:59]	<zeeeee>	@HLINK is what happened
[negative]	[23:59]	<Steve^>	"nucco, yea, its working like I thought. You don't make a logical partition. You make them all with the ""logical"" option, it assigned them to sda5,6,7 and it'll make the logical bit for you"
[negative]	[23:59]	<KooperKool>	What happens if I remove ubuntu-desktop?
[negative]	[23:59]	<KrimZon>	what's that acpi script in hardy where you can enable/disable laptop-mode?
[neutral]	[23:59]	<hwilde>	KooperKool, what do you think man?  it uninstalls the desktop
[negative]	[23:59]	<Steve^>	nucco, its trying to be user friendly and therefore confusing people who know what they want
[neutral]	[23:59]	<josh04>	KooperKool: nothing, it's a meta-package

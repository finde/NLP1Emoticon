[none]	[00:00]	<ubuntuROX>	its waiting on you t accept it.
[none]	[00:00]	<f0rmat>	may i ask exactly who are the coders of ubuntu are they just everyone or anyone?
[none]	[00:00]	<cygoku>	goat|work ... Windows is not there at all anymore, I installed over it
[none]	[00:00]	<barslow>	x1250: wasnt able to actually get into ubuntu and I dont know enough terminal to diagnose
[none]	[00:00]	<oddalot>	ubuntoROX it won't let me send private msgs on this server, don't know if that will affect sending files as well
[none]	[00:00]	<RyanPrior>	matt____: If the LiveCD doesn't work, it's likely to be a graphics card driver problem.
[none]	[00:00]	<goat|work>	cygoku: oh
[none]	[00:00]	<Saladin>	Oh wow!
[none]	[00:00]	<ubuntuROX>	have an email address?
[none]	[00:00]	<Saladin>	Auto 3D windows
[none]	[00:00]	<PePa>	will I need to boot from the alt.CD, or can I just ...
[none]	[00:00]	<oddalot>	oddalot@yahoo.com
[none]	[00:00]	<maco>	PePa: no just have to mount it and add it as a repository
[none]	[00:00]	<goat|work>	cygoku: yes, then if you have,  sure
[none]	[00:00]	<tanath>	f0rmat, you can find more info about that on launchpad.net
[none]	[00:00]	<dragao-azul>	how can graphics card problems be solved in the live cd?
[negative]	[00:01]	<Fishscene>	Who had the pink window problem in this screenshot? http://www.multigesture.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/screenshot.png
[none]	[00:01]	<f0rmat>	tanath, thankyou
[none]	[00:01]	<barslow>	RyanPrior: One last question, I have compiz and all my themes setup just the way I like them, will they stay the same after the uprgrade (I'm using AWN with modified Mac4lin and Compiz is all set perfect)
[none]	[00:01]	<matt____>	"RyanPrior: perhaps...but 7.10 is working fine. how could i check/fix though? the live cd takes me to a ""busybox"", not a normal terminal."
[none]	[00:01]	<x1250>	barslow: /var/log/Xorg.0.log is the place to look, or ~/.xsession-errors
[none]	[00:01]	<goat|work>	cygoku: i wont be able to watch the channel, so if you have more q's message me
[none]	[00:01]	<arbrandes>	"dragao-azul, use ""safe graphics mode"""
[none]	[00:01]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, any advice?
[none]	[00:01]	<tanath>	barslow, should be no change
[none]	[00:01]	<cygoku>	goat|work ... Thank you, and sorry for my rudeness earlier
[none]	[00:01]	<barslow>	hmm
[none]	[00:01]	<PePa>	OK
[none]	[00:01]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: I'd just about bet that something will break and you'll spend hours reconfiguring things. Upgrades tend to mess with your stuff.
[none]	[00:01]	<dragao-azul>	abrandes, then how can i solve the problems? make my ati card work fine?
[none]	[00:01]	<PePa>	thanks Maco
[none]	[00:01]	<maco>	Fishscene: nvidia driver quality
[none]	[00:01]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, did you answer my  last question?
[none]	[00:01]	<kilrae>	can you mount an encrypted lvm in Vista?
[none]	[00:01]	<tanath>	barslow, actually..
[none]	[00:01]	<oddalot>	i wonder how nerdy it would be if all these 1500 people where in a room at one time
[negative]	[00:01]	<sileni>	"he i installed build essential and tried to ""make"" but i get this error http://pastebin.com/m6dda8b39"
[none]	[00:02]	<ubuntuROX>	there you go,, thats the one thats set for resolution auto,  it should work for you.
[none]	[00:02]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, are you able to get a DHCP IP from the router?
[none]	[00:02]	<barslow>	ryanprior: im just gunna stick with gutsy then
[none]	[00:02]	<maco>	barslow: should stay, yes
[none]	[00:02]	<glaxo>	"tcpdumpgod, no - i get ""No DHCPOFFERS received"""
[none]	[00:02]	<oddalot>	ok thanks, let me try it
[none]	[00:02]	<ubuntuROX>	modes anyhow
[none]	[00:02]	<barslow>	wow conflicting opinions
[none]	[00:02]	<tanath>	barslow, it may switch to the new default theme, but you can save your current theme/settings, and switch back after upgrade
[none]	[00:02]	<Jimdb>	matt___try a different CD reader...try adding ide=nodma on command line when you boot into the installer.
[positive]	[00:02]	<RyanPrior>	oddalot: That's the Ubuntu Live conference. :-)
[none]	[00:02]	<laeg>	barslow: stick with gutsy forever?
[none]	[00:02]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, do you know your routers ip address? 192.168.1.1?
[none]	[00:02]	<matt____>	"RyanPrior: perhaps...but 7.10 is working fine. how could i check/fix though? the live cd takes me to a ""busybox"", not a normal terminal."
[none]	[00:02]	<sileni>	i dont understand how to change the flags
[none]	[00:02]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, 192.168.0.1
[none]	[00:02]	<tanath>	barslow, i didn't have that problem though
[none]	[00:02]	<sileni>	like that error states
[none]	[00:02]	<barslow>	laeg: i dont want to but i dont wanna risk having to reformat my HD again
[none]	[00:02]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, are you using KDE or Gnome?
[none]	[00:02]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, gnome
[none]	[00:02]	<Fishscene>	"Maco: it looked like the ""mirror"" or ""shadow"" (I forgot which) option in Compiz could fix that issue (Disabling the mirror or shadow effects)"
[none]	[00:03]	<oddalot>	RyanPriot: Where is this ubuntu live conference?
[none]	[00:03]	<mohbana>	can i install ubuntu from a ntfs? without the wubi thing? i don't have a dvd to burn it on
[none]	[00:03]	<oddalot>	err when too
[positive]	[00:03]	<maco>	barslow: your compiz settings will be saved.  there are more features in the new compiz though, so you might want to explore them after you upgrade
[none]	[00:03]	<basso>	I Love You All!
[none]	[00:03]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, have you tried setting your IP to 192.168.0.100, your netmask to 255.255.255.0, and your gateway to 192.168.0.1?
[none]	[00:03]	<tanath>	barslow, there's always a risk when upgrading. personally, it fixed a lot of stuff for me, and i had minimal issues
[none]	[00:03]	<matt____>	RyanPrior: well, what would i search google for to fix this graphics card setting?
[none]	[00:03]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, I have (with 192.168.0.200) as .100 is already taken
[none]	[00:03]	<tanath>	barslow, and none of my settings in anything changed
[none]	[00:03]	<ubuntuROX>	I think its faster than gutsy was.
[none]	[00:03]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: It's certainly possible that you could upgrade and have everything work perfectly - the Ubuntu developers certainly try hard to make that happen. You can't bet on it, though.
[negative]	[00:03]	<Flannel>	mohbana: there are ways to install without burning, check it out: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation
[none]	[00:03]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, is 192.168.0.101 taken?
[none]	[00:03]	<oddalot>	brb
[none]	[00:04]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, yes
[none]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	Hm.
[none]	[00:04]	<LOVElinux>	salve a tutti!
[none]	[00:04]	<RyanPrior>	matt____: Google and the Ubuntu Forums are good places to search.
[none]	[00:04]	<DBautell>	"heh, ""select best server"" ""no suitable server was found"""
[positive]	[00:04]	<tanath>	yeah, it's faster :D
[none]	[00:04]	<barslow>	tanath: i am correct in assuming if I run the live-cd and have no issues that the upgrade will work?
[none]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, do that now...
[none]	[00:04]	<maco>	RyanPrior: given my hardware, id take that bet
[none]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	I am unable, for some reason, to install any extensions.
[none]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	set your ip to 192.168.0.101
[none]	[00:04]	<barslow>	RyanPrior: same question
[none]	[00:04]	<RyanPrior>	matt____: If you can get a hold of Amaranth, he/she tends to know a lot about graphics card issues as well.
[none]	[00:04]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, i have tried a manual set up through gnomes network manager and through /etc/network/interfaces and it still doesnt work
[none]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	netmask: 255.255.255.0
[none]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	Sorry for being a pain - first upgrade.
[none]	[00:04]	<tanath>	barslow, that should be the case, though i've seen the livecd not work, and the install work...
[none]	[00:04]	<Cpudan80>	Anyone know why I can't play 2 sounds at the same time?
[none]	[00:04]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, check your PMs
[none]	[00:04]	<maco>	barslow: im using my compiz settings from feisty
[none]	[00:04]	<Saladin>	And I mean, extensions in Firefox.
[none]	[00:04]	<ubuntuROX>	make sure that FF3 is completely shut down before starting ff2
[none]	[00:04]	<maco>	barslow: it works fine
[none]	[00:04]	<matt____>	RyanPrior: ok, thanks
[none]	[00:04]	<barslow>	tanath: interesting
[positive]	[00:04]	<ng01>	saladin.  ur such a pain... :)
[none]	[00:04]	<romulo>	hi, i installed the fglrx driver on ati but fgl_glxgears is not working and 3d apps are generally slow (like q3 in this super machine), can anyone hlelp me?
[none]	[00:04]	<dragao-azul>	"if i install ubuntu is there any ""easy"" way to get my ATI HD2900Pro card working with all the graphics effects?"
[none]	[00:05]	<x1250>	Cpudan80: upgrading from gutsy?
[none]	[00:05]	<Cpudan80>	like ehh if I am using rhythmbox and xchat at the same time - and I get pinged in xchat, I wont hear the ping
[none]	[00:05]	<Cpudan80>	x1250: Yeah - just did
[none]	[00:05]	<ubuntuROX>	Saladin,, make sure FF3 is completely shut down before starting FF2
[none]	[00:05]	<ben-g>	i enabled my wireless in restricted drivers. Why won't it work?
[none]	[00:05]	<tanath>	barslow, there can be issues running of a disc. it's slower for one
[none]	[00:05]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: No, the LiveCD is not proof positive that the upgrade will work. The upgrade is affected by all the changes and customizations you make, so some of those may be messed with and you'll have to reconfigure things the way you want them.
[none]	[00:05]	<matt____>	Amaranth: hey buddy...after trying the 8.04 live cd (kubuntu and ubuntu), neither boots, both take me to a busybox, could this be a graphics issue?
[none]	[00:05]	<igormorgado>	is there any kernel difference between server/desktop  editions?
[none]	[00:05]	<x1250>	Cpudan80: try installing pulseaudio
[none]	[00:05]	<tcpdumpgod>	glaxo, check your private messages
[none]	[00:05]	<mad_max02>	Would it be smart to go for update to hardy or is a clean install better choice ???
[none]	[00:05]	<maco>	romulo: are you using fglrx on a card that is so old its not supported with taght driver? thats the symptoms i saw when opensuse tried to use that driver on a radeon 9250
[none]	[00:05]	<barslow>	I'm real nervous about upgrading
[none]	[00:05]	<glaxo>	tcpdumpgod, I cant reply as im not registered - let me register
[none]	[00:05]	<ubuntuROX>	otherwise you are still actually running FF3,, same thing happens the other way.
[none]	[00:05]	<tanath>	dragao-azul, run 'gksu displayconfig-gtk'
[positive]	[00:05]	<igormorgado>	omg.. the chanel is very busy today, more than usual =D
[negative]	[00:05]	<matt____>	mad_max02: i alwaws clean install. the only time i tried updating, it didn't work right :(*
[none]	[00:05]	<x1250>	Cpudan80: then configure pulseaudio to be used in system->prefs->sound
[none]	[00:05]	<romulo>	maco, my card is supported, its an x600 mobility
[none]	[00:05]	<barslow>	i finally have ubuntu exactly how i like it
[none]	[00:05]	<tcpdumpgod>	okay glaxo
[none]	[00:06]	<Cpudan80>	x1250: I'll give it a shot - thanks
[none]	[00:06]	<dragao-azul>	tanath, after that will it work fine? i don't have to do anything else?
[none]	[00:06]	<Fishscene>	Conventional wisdom dictates that clean installs are always better (and cleaner) than upgrades
[positive]	[00:06]	<ubuntuROX>	my ubuntu is so how I like it its booring now :)
[none]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: If you have it exactly how you want it, no pressure to upgrade! It's still supported for many months.
[none]	[00:06]	<gnuskoo1>	barslow: go on, it'll be alright, or fun sorting it out
[none]	[00:06]	<igormorgado>	is there any kernel difference between server/desktop  editions?
[none]	[00:06]	<tanath>	dragao-azul, to configure X right. then run 'glxinfo | grep -i direct' to check for direct rendering
[none]	[00:06]	<mad_max02>	matt____, thanks dude. I'll dl the 64 bit ver and install it tomorrow.
[none]	[00:06]	<iDano84>	ok, I got Ubuntu discs in the mail today. I'm the first to admit, I know little to know little to nothing about linux. When I pop in the disc (v 7.10 x64) I select install Ubuntu, and then loss of video input. I Have no idea where to start?
[none]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: If it's perfect right now, then it's only downhill from here, right?
[none]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	igormorgado: Nope, same kernel.
[negative]	[00:06]	<teo->	i need some help.. when i try to start ubuntu it doesn't start.. some busybox shell is started please help ?:S
[none]	[00:06]	<igormorgado>	RyanPrior: thank you
[none]	[00:06]	<tanath>	dragao-azul, there's a 'test' button to make sure you have it configured right, but after that, it should be good
[none]	[00:06]	<RyanPrior>	igormorgado: Same kernel, same packages, same tool chain, etc.
[none]	[00:06]	<pale-yafa>	guys, I have no firebug any more, cant work like that, why this is not mentioned?
[none]	[00:07]	<Saladin>	Yeah, I made sure FF3 was shut down, but still no success in installing extensions
[none]	[00:07]	<RyanPrior>	pale-yafa: Firebug works.
[none]	[00:07]	<gnuskoo1>	igormorgado: no, server has no desktop only
[none]	[00:07]	<dragao-azul>	tanath, ok, thz i'm going to try that
[none]	[00:07]	<tanath>	Saladin, still having trouble with extensions? did you try that extension i mentioned?
[none]	[00:07]	<ubuntuROX>	wierd,, you went to terminal and ran ps ax|grep firefox
[none]	[00:07]	<maco>	pale-yafa: firebug 1.2
[none]	[00:07]	<barslow>	RyanPrior: agreed
[none]	[00:07]	<pretender>	koverartist I cant select case in ubntu.  Any Ideas
[none]	[00:07]	<pale-yafa>	RyanPrior: its not, I upgraded to 8.4 and its telling me  its not compitable
[none]	[00:07]	<Saladin>	Sorry tanath, I missed what you said.
[none]	[00:07]	<james_>	how long would the online update to 8.04 take?
[none]	[00:07]	<maco>	pale-yafa: firebug 1.2
[none]	[00:07]	<Dason>	So..... what do I do if I can't download and install 8.04 if it won't work through the 'recommended' way?
[none]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, no you didn't
[positive]	[00:08]	<joh6nn>	i'm not quite sure how to explain this properly, but whenever i use screen, apps like vim, that do their own paging, don't clear the screen properly.  i'm fairly certain that i just need to tell screen to pretend it's a different terminal, but i don't know which terminal to tell it to be.  anyone have ideas?
[none]	[00:08]	<barslow>	i think i'll wait untill there are a couple updates to 8.04 b4 taking the plunge
[none]	[00:08]	<maco>	pale-yafa: you need to update your firebug
[none]	[00:08]	<ubuntuROX>	just to make absolutely sure it was shut down?
[none]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, was a while ago. you acknowledged it
[none]	[00:08]	<dee_cz>	hi, im running the memtest from ubuntu cd, how long should it take?
[positive]	[00:08]	<igormorgado>	gnuskoo1: thank you too =D
[none]	[00:08]	<cygoku>	Using Hardy Heron RC here ... Are the repos down ??
[none]	[00:08]	<maco>	cygoku: of course
[none]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, nightly tester tools extension
[none]	[00:08]	<ubuntuROX>	yes,, but cygoku did you update recently?
[none]	[00:08]	<gnuskoo1>	i got thinkpad r51 and gnome is really sluggish on xfce, any hints? intel 82528 graphics card
[none]	[00:08]	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: It will take forever, literally. It keeps running until you tell it to stop.
[none]	[00:08]	<cygoku>	"Maco : ""of course"" ??"
[none]	[00:08]	<barslow>	ryanprior: can you choose to install8.04 without Firefox beta3
[none]	[00:08]	<maco>	cygoku: its release day for a very popular distro.  what makes you think they could survive that?
[none]	[00:08]	<Fishscene>	All Servers for Hardy Heron are bogged down at the moment and likely will be for at least another day.
[none]	[00:08]	<Dason>	what do I do if I can't download and install 8.04 if it won't work through the 'recommended' way?
[negative]	[00:08]	<teo->	i need some help.. when i try to start ubuntu it doesn't start.. some busybox shell is started please help ?:S
[none]	[00:08]	<Flannel>	igormorgado, RyanPrior: There are kernel differences.  They have different hardware support (non-server is more likely to support 'regular' obscure hardware), and server has PREEMPT turned off, among other changes.  Of course, you can run a server kernel on the desktop, or a generic kernel on a server.
[positive]	[00:08]	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: The longer it runs without errors, the more sure you are that you don't have faulty memory. :-)
[none]	[00:08]	<tanath>	Saladin, makes firefox think your extensions are compatible. but i recommend enabling them one at a time
[none]	[00:09]	<matt____>	Amaranth: hey buddy...after trying the 8.04 live cd (kubuntu and ubuntu), neither boots, both take me to a busybox, could this be a graphics issue?
[none]	[00:09]	<maco>	cygoku: this happened last time too.
[none]	[00:09]	<dee_cz>	RyanPrior: do you know what is the 'safe' margin? how long should it run so that i can say it probably isnt the memory?
[none]	[00:09]	<RyanPrior>	barslow: Nope, distro upgrades are all-or-nothing affairs pretty much.
[none]	[00:09]	<tanath>	Saladin, 'cause some will work, and some won't, and some may prevent it from running
[none]	[00:09]	<ubuntuROX>	michael If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo grub-update to fix that.
[none]	[00:09]	<cygoku>	I think they can survive that because nothing should affect the linux image
[none]	[00:09]	<Dason>	what are other methods of installing 8.04?
[none]	[00:09]	<ubuntuROX>	cygoku If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo grub-update to fix that.
[none]	[00:09]	<RyanPrior>	dee_cz: If you're seriously suspicious about your memory, I'd run it for a few hours to get your memory really hot and loaded.
[none]	[00:09]	<igormorgado>	Flannel: I wish to know if desktop one has virtualization support.
[none]	[00:09]	<maco>	"cygoku: last time the entire ubuntu.com was taken down and replaced with a plain white background, black text ""welcome to ubuntu.com here's a list of download links:"" page"
[none]	[00:09]	<gnuskoo1>	teo-: what messages you getting?
[none]	[00:09]	<cwillu>	pale-yafa, this is kinda scary:  you need to use firebug, but you can't be bothered to check getfirebug.com, where it lists a version of firebug that works with ff3? ;p
[negative]	[00:09]	<DBautell>	dason, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. To mount the ISO you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[none]	[00:09]	<tmccrary>	So.... Hardy breaks eclipse
[none]	[00:09]	<tanath>	Saladin, if you end up enabling a bad one that prevents it from running, then run an older firefox to fix it
[none]	[00:09]	<tmccrary>	Fantastic
[none]	[00:10]	<tanath>	Saladin, (ie., disable that extension)
[none]	[00:10]	<DBautell>	Dason, or did you mean a fresh install?
[none]	[00:10]	<maco>	Dason: whats the recommended way that you cant do?
[positive]	[00:10]	<dee_cz>	RyanPrior: its that xp is turning sound from the card into a squeal and gives a bsod every other day, with no specific error... but the 8.04 runs fine :/
[none]	[00:10]	<Saladin>	Well, strangely enough, tanath, that extension installed okay.
[none]	[00:10]	<RyanPrior>	tmccrary: Eclipse is not well supported on Ubuntu. However, I downloaded the latest Eclipse and run it from my /home folder, and it runs fine.
[none]	[00:10]	<Dason>	the update manager
[none]	[00:10]	<Saladin>	Whereas all others aren't.
[positive]	[00:10]	<tanath>	Saladin, the nightly tester tools? of course ;)
[none]	[00:10]	<jrabbit>	ok
[none]	[00:10]	<tmccrary>	RyanPrior: Thanks for the tip. It ran great with Gutsy....
[none]	[00:10]	<Fishscene>	My hats off to Hardy Heron! Built in VMware support? How cool is that?
[none]	[00:10]	<Dason>	I don't want a fresh install
[none]	[00:10]	<jrabbit>	It errored for the third time
[none]	[00:10]	<teo->	gnuskoo1 i don't get anything i am just putted in the busybox shell
[none]	[00:11]	<pale-yafa>	cwillu: how would I know thats its there? I just got a message that firefox beta does not support firebug, maybe it should say THIS VIRSION of firebug
[positive]	[00:11]	<rich_freecomm>	heh, never download the desktop iso and the aleternate iso then try to update manager the new release.....it's gonna take me awhile :)
[positive]	[00:11]	<DirkGently>	hey Fujitsu: tested Kubuntu on my laptop... the bcm43xx works fine... the PC even picks up my wireless router now without manual config... it was worth waiting a day :)

[none]	[00:11]	<jrabbit>	Repeats
[none]	[00:11]	<RyanPrior>	pale-yafa: That's true. A better error message would be helpful.
[none]	[00:11]	<jrabbit>	then a SQUASHFS error
[positive]	[00:11]	<pale-yafa>	anyway, if any body interested: Samba broke while upgrading
[none]	[00:11]	<maco>	Dason: oh...wait 2 days
[none]	[00:11]	<Killeroid>	Dason: too many people upgrading right now, servers hammered
[none]	[00:11]	<ubuntuROX>	Dason,, all the servers are bogged down with users
[none]	[00:12]	<Dason>	Oh that's sensible
[none]	[00:12]	<Dason>	No alternate repo's?
[none]	[00:12]	<RyanPrior>	Dason: Or, download the alternate CD via BitTorrent, burn it and put it in, and upgrade off of there.
[none]	[00:12]	<gnuskoo1>	do they release server download stats?
[positive]	[00:12]	<maco>	Dason: theyre all pounded too :P

[none]	[00:12]	<maco>	Dason: you can upgrade from an alternate cd
[none]	[00:12]	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo update-grub to fix that.
[none]	[00:12]	<CyberCod>	can someone tell me the md5sum for Hardy Desktop iso?  just burnt a fresh copy and it is bunk
[none]	[00:12]	<maco>	Dason: and there actually is a way to make it search for faster/working repos

[none]	[00:13]	<c0mp13371331337_>	Help!  I started my dist-upgrade from work via SSH and miscalculated how long it would take!  I now have to leave work (and close the SSH connection).  If I send the apt-get process to the background, can I bring it to the foreground in a terminal window at home?

[none]	[00:13]	<Dason>	Bittorrent was killer fast. so.. what's the command to use while in the cd?
[none]	[00:13]	<pale-yafa>	also: image with transparent backgrounds are having frames, which was not the case with Gutsy
[none]	[00:13]	<maco>	Dason: what tanath said

[none]	[00:13]	<ubuntuROX>	Some_Person If you have been running the Beta or RC version, and it shows development branch, and no updates available you are likely running stable but will want to run sudo update-grub to fix that.
[none]	[00:13]	<RyanPrior>	Some_Person: the RC and the final release are the same thing, unless the RC has major errors that get fixed.

[none]	[00:18]	<maco>	linkmaster03: when people stop killing them
[none]	[00:18]	<sean_>	If I had hardy beta, do the regular updates just make it into the final version? or do I have to dist-upgrade?

[none]	[00:18]	<Flannel>	sean_: yeah, just regular daily updates
[none]	[00:18]	<Fishscene>	linkmaster03, probably in a day or 2 when things settle down
[none]	[00:18]	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Probably in a few days. In the meanwhile, I suggest downloading via BitTorrent. There are thousands of seeds, it's super fast!
[none]	[00:18]	<ubuntuROX>	cygoku why do you need to download it? if you were running RC and its updated, all you have to do is update your grub.
[none]	[00:18]	<cwillu>	nibsa1242b, network will update all the packages you have (aka, won't break things that depend on older versions)
[positive]	[00:19]	<sean_>	maco, Flannel: Thanks. I wished it'd be more exciting but that works. :-)
[none]	[00:19]	<x1250>	linkmaster03: just use some mirror repos

[none]	[00:19]	<linkmaster03>	Ryan, i'm just trying to get some synaptic packages =S
[none]	[00:19]	<DBautell>	mad_max02, you might split that one down the middle, and have two distros installed... Sort of what I'm doing, so I can try different things out
[none]	[00:19]	<Saladin>	But, now I have done that, because of no extensions working, all of them fail on FF2 now as well. I used apt-get to install 2.
[none]	[00:19]	<ubuntuROX>	really? linux is hot right now eh?
[none]	[00:19]	<Dason>	no waii man
[none]	[00:19]	<tanath>	Ian1, it should take care of itself..

[none]	[00:20]	<ubuntuROX>	it might be worth a try, mine just worked
[none]	[00:20]	<RyanPrior>	linkmaster03: Technically the servers aren't down right now - it's just that they're serving tens of thousands of requests.

[positive]	[00:21]	<Ian1>	gnuskoo1: Well I tried (and failed I suppose) to add an XP line to my list file for grub, and when I tried to boot to it, XP's loader seems to have supplanted grub so now it just goes to that failed boot when i start my computer
[none]	[00:21]	<dubby>	hey anyone, I need a very stable java jre and anycase i installed sun-java6 and I need the firefox plugin
[none]	[00:21]	<tanath>	Saladin, nightly tester tools alters the extensions compatibility. ff2 thinks they don't work anymore. you'll prolly have to reinstall them if you want to go back..
[none]	[00:21]	<ubuntuROX>	I have been using it for almost a year now

[positive]	[00:21]	<Fishscene>	The servers are undergoing the equivelant of DDoS attack- except it's ALL legitimate traffic. :)

[none]	[00:21]	<ubuntuROX>	ahh,, see theres your problem
[none]	[00:21]	<eduardo>	Question: How do i upgrade ubuntu from the terminal?
[none]	[00:21]	<cwillu>	sp219-away, please give it more than 30 seconds between repeats
[none]	[00:21]	<Saladin>	Although... It only took me three days to know I wasn't going back to Windows
[none]	[00:21]	<maco>	spork969: kompozer is the latest release of nvu
[none]	[00:21]	<Dason>	apt-get upgrade (sud)
[none]	[00:21]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, you tried letting it go for a few mins?
[none]	[00:21]	<Dason>	sudo apt-get upgrade
[none]	[00:21]	<ubuntuROX>	at least I bet its your problem,, uninstall that nightly tools extention
[none]	[00:21]	<RyanPrior>	Eduardo, I don't suggest doing it today.
[none]	[00:21]	<ubutom>	"Hi guys, I have a problem with my xserver, or with the ""unbreakable"" xserver, I think, can someone help me?"
[none]	[00:22]	<Saladin>	tanath, however... Nightly isn't showing up on the extensions list.
[none]	[00:22]	<RyanPrior>	eduardo: The servers are totally swamped.
[none]	[00:22]	<spork969>	maco, gotcha
[none]	[00:22]	<eduardo>	RyanPrior: why is that?
[none]	[00:22]	<maco>	!ask | ubutom
[positive]	[00:22]	<ubotu>	ubutom: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[none]	[00:22]	<cygoku>	I thought the repos would be mirrored or something.
[none]	[00:22]	<eduardo>	RyanPrior: ohhh
[none]	[00:22]	<ubuntuROX>	go to FF3 it should be there
[none]	[00:22]	<maco>	eduardo: /me points at calendar
[none]	[00:22]	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: it just worked... doesn't seem to be a good server though... yeah earlier I let it go for about 10min the window just went blank
[none]	[00:22]	<tanath>	Saladin, huh... well i've never downgraded like that, so...
[none]	[00:22]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: The repos are mirrored, all over the world. They are all swamped.
[none]	[00:22]	<ubuntuROX>	then un-install it

[none]	[00:22]	<ibleed>	i only have swap / and /home partitions.  what other possible partitions might i want and what might their sizes be ?
[none]	[00:22]	<maco>	cygoku: they are. there are hundreds of mirrors.  theyre pretty much all swamped.
[none]	[00:22]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, hrm, i guess they're getting hammered worse than i thought
[negative]	[00:22]	<Flannel>	eduardo: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades has instructions
[none]	[00:22]	<alienbrain>	I just tried Hardy Heron Installation LiveCD feature, my network is not working. I don't see my module. Should I hope for better after installation or this aspect won't change?
[none]	[00:22]	<cygoku>	That's crazy you know.
[none]	[00:23]	<maco>	alienbrain: wired or wireless?
[positive]	[00:23]	<ere4si>	ibleed: a partition for / is handy
[none]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	maco, wireless
[none]	[00:23]	<sean_>	"I had compiz working fine in beta, but now I upgraded and whenever I go to ""normal"" or ""extra"" I lose all window decorations. Any ideas?"
[none]	[00:23]	<maco>	alienbrain: do you have any wired connection available?
[positive]	[00:23]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Millions of Ubuntu users try to upgrade all at once; thus, we have craziness aplenty. :-)
[none]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	maco, ipw3945 module
[none]	[00:23]	<Ertyle>	alienbrain: if it doesn't work on the live CD, then it doesn't work in the installation. out of the box, that is - it's entirely possible that you *can* get it to work!
[none]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	maco, yep sure
[none]	[00:23]	<ibleed>	ere4si, yes i have swap, /, and /home.  i'm wondering what others are useful
[none]	[00:23]	<x1250>	alienbrain: it will probably won't work
[none]	[00:23]	<cygoku>	""" millions "" ????"
[none]	[00:23]	<cwillu>	alienbrain, what chipset?
[none]	[00:23]	<Dason>	Now to get copywritten DVD's to work right.....
[none]	[00:23]	<ubutom>	Well, maco, everytime I start up ubuntu now it doesnt work, the xserver simply doesnt come up. i tried dpgk-reconfigure, I erased and replaced the xorg.conf, but no joy...
[none]	[00:23]	<alienbrain>	Ertyle, I see, it was working on Gutsy though, out of the box
[none]	[00:23]	<maco>	alienbrain: oh you have a 3945? the module is now called iwl3945. it works great for me
[none]	[00:23]	<MachinTrucChose>	first thing to do in every ubuntu install: disable the *!!@#$ motherboard beep
[positive]	[00:23]	<ere4si>	ibleed: that is all really - unless it is a server
[positive]	[00:23]	<nibsa1242b>	ibleed: /var ~4GB (or less) good for log files... you don't want to have some faulty device fill up your log files and make your system unbootable... and /boot ~500MB (should hopefully be enough)
[none]	[00:23]	<x1250>	alienbrain: but that doesn't mean you can't make it work...
[none]	[00:23]	<sandfisch>	is it possible to update the beta to full?
[none]	[00:24]	<alienbrain>	cwillu, Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG
[none]	[00:24]	<tanath>	sean_, try running 'compiz --replace' from a terminal, and see the output
[none]	[00:24]	<Flannel>	sandfisch: yes, just regular daily updates
[none]	[00:24]	<Dason>	Machin! Tell me now! I hate it!
[none]	[00:24]	<RyanPrior>	cygoku: Yup, supposedly Ubuntu has about 10 million users, so if more than 10% try to upgrade, that's millions.
[none]	[00:24]	<Ertyle>	alienbrain: then file a bug
[none]	[00:24]	<sean_>	sandfisch: Just do regular updates and you're all set!
[none]	[00:24]	<Baughn>	MachinTrucChose: I've found that an axe does that very well
[none]	[00:24]	<nibsa1242b>	tanath: I think I'll just wait a few days to upgrade... no rush
[negative]	[00:24]	<MachinTrucChose>	dason: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_disable_the_pc_speaker_(beep!)
[none]	[00:24]	<the_darkside_986>	Everything operation in hardy is laggy and slow, and the CPU fan keeps spinning. What do I type to fix this?
[none]	[00:24]	<tanath>	sean_, er, make that 'compiz --replace &'
[none]	[00:24]	<ibleed>	nibsa1242b, what about /opt ?  is that useful ?
[none]	[00:24]	<Mimi>	alienbrain:  you have a problem w/ 3945? It's been fixed...
[none]	[00:24]	<Ertyle>	sandfisch: just let it run its normal updates, and you'll have final
[none]	[00:24]	<cygoku>	Well I am impressed.
[none]	[00:24]	<gaucho>	My audio isn't working.. It was perfectly working about 5 minutes ago on gutsy. I have an Asus p5b motherboard. What can I do?
[none]	[00:24]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, thought you said it just worked?
[positive]	[00:24]	<alienbrain>	x1250, I understand, but I'm trying to assess how much time I need to spend after upgrading :)
[none]	[00:24]	<maco>	RyanPrior: you only hit multiple millions when 20% try to upgrade
[none]	[00:24]	<ubutom>	atm i can only access the root repair console
[none]	[00:24]	<tanath>	nibsa1242b, meh
[none]	[00:25]	<x1250>	alienbrain: did it work on gutsy?
[none]	[00:25]	<phiqtion>	how can i install XMMS in HARDY? thx
[positive]	[00:25]	<cwillu>	maco, as if 50% of the installed base isn't trying to upgrade though :p
[none]	[00:25]	<RyanPrior>	maco: I call 1.1 more than one million, thus millions. One and one tenth millions.
[none]	[00:25]	<maco>	crimsun: ping
[none]	[00:25]	<ubutom>	every attempt to start gdm fails, failsafe graphics seems to be broken
[none]	[00:25]	<maco>	cwillu: yeah...
[none]	[00:25]	<sean_>	tanath: I think I need to re-enable nvidia drivers, does that make sense?
[none]	[00:25]	<alienbrain>	Mimi, in Gutsy, I would see that ipw3945 module is automatically loaded. Now in Hardy, I don't see it. Even when I try to modprobe. It's not there
[positive]	[00:25]	<nibsa1242b>	ibleed: I don't know, never needed an /opt before but I'm just running it on a few computers for personal use
[none]	[00:25]	<cygoku>	Danson ??
[none]	[00:25]	<DBautell>	even ,75 is a multiple
[none]	[00:25]	<ubutom>	so, what should I do? Does someone have an idea?
[none]	[00:25]	<maco>	alienbrain: its not called that
[none]	[00:25]	<tanath>	sean_, ah. in that case displayconfig-gtk may help
[none]	[00:25]	<yeknom_traf>	which version of ubuntu would i want to install on an iMac with duocore processor?
[none]	[00:25]	<maco>	alienbrain: its called iwl3945
[none]	[00:25]	<cygoku>	I mean Dason ??
[none]	[00:25]	<maco>	alienbrain: theres a new driver
[none]	[00:25]	<alienbrain>	maco, aha, let me check please
[none]	[00:25]	<Baughn>	sean_: You need to reinstall the nvidia drivers every time you upgrade your kernel. Which a distribution upgrade does. Granted, it might be automatic normally, but apparently not now..
[none]	[00:25]	<Joelito>	Hi, I can't use livCD of ubuntu 8.04
[none]	[00:25]	<phiqtion>	how can i enable UNIVERSE and MULTIVERSE in HARDY?
[none]	[00:25]	<nibsa1242b>	alienbrain: check restricted drivers manager to see if you have to enable it in there
[none]	[00:25]	<Saladin>	Now, when I click on the launcher for FF3, it is FF2 that pops up. I am totally confused.
[none]	[00:26]	<Joelito>	and the md5sum is correct
[none]	[00:26]	<x1250>	alienbrain: you can always uninstall kernel metapackages (linux-image, linux-image-generic, linux-headers-generic, etc) and use them in hardy
[negative]	[00:26]	<Mimi>	alienbrain:  (sorry if you've already said that, but I just joined the channel) .. and this is the realease, not the release candidate or beta? I have the same card as yours, and I installed hardy from livecd.. wireless worked there, and after install it worked too :/ sorry not sure how to help, thought it was fixed for all of us
[none]	[00:26]	<tanath>	phiqtion, System > Admin > Software Sources
[none]	[00:26]	<sean_>	Baughn: Jest because it's newly released?
[none]	[00:26]	<fdsjkalf>	is archive.ubuntu.com down?
[none]	[00:26]	<RyanPrior>	"yeknom_traf: Ubuntu 8.04 ""Hardy Heron"" is the hot item now. It's available via BitTorrent, but today is release day so non-BitTorrent servers are very slow and swamped."
[none]	[00:26]	<maco>	Joelito: do a cd check and be more specific, please
[none]	[00:26]	<Jorophose>	Hi, important advisor, I'm an idiot who tries too hard. If I upgrade from 6.06 to 8.04: How long will it take me to do that (do I have to download a full 700MB?), is there any chance of it bjorking my system? and can I do it at any time or only today before there's newer nightly builds?
[none]	[00:26]	<jjt001>	where is cgi-bin located in ubuntu?
[positive]	[00:26]	<Mimi>	﻿/me asks :  is it possible to increase the DPI on gnome? ... I have 1200x800 but it seems like a simple window takes most of the screen :P
[none]	[00:26]	<alienbrain>	maco, I can see the driver is there
[none]	[00:26]	<Mike_T>	nv
[none]	[00:26]	<maco>	fdsjkalf: its a release day. how could it possibly stay up?
[none]	[00:26]	<x1250>	alienbrain: I meant: uninstall kernel metapackages, and upgrade to hardy. Then, as metapackages are not installed, then your kernel version will be preserved.
[none]	[00:27]	<nibsa1242b>	sean_: Baughn I think sometimes the necessary drivers take a few days after the dist upgrade to become available for the kernel version
[none]	[00:27]	<Baughn>	sean_: I don't actually know if it normally does, but if it does, then the reason it doesn't /now/ would be because it's a separate upgrade system that doesn't know about that detail
[positive]	[00:27]	<alienbrain>	Mimi, sure, that gives me higher hopes! :)
[none]	[00:27]	<phiqtion>	tanath: they are selected already but i can't find XMMS in the sources?
[none]	[00:27]	<sean_>	tanath, oh, nevermind. I forgot that was on my laptop! It uses intel drivers which is correct. Do I need to install xgl?
[none]	[00:27]	<jjt001>	maco: is cgi-bin located in var/www?
[none]	[00:27]	<ubutom>	xserver dead, failsafe doesnt work, dpkg-reconfigure no joy, erasing xor.conf and replacing with old version no joy, any ideas?
[none]	[00:27]	<cwillu>	Mimi, prefrerences | appearance| fonts
[none]	[00:27]	<RyanPrior>	Mimi: System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution
[none]	[00:27]	<nous>	how do I start the graphic card config wizard ?
[none]	[00:27]	<Baughn>	nibsa1242b: That's why there's a compile-from-source option
[none]	[00:27]	<maco>	jjt001: *shrug* i never figured out how to make apache go on my laptop
[none]	[00:27]	<nibsa1242b>	Baughn: mmm fun
[none]	[00:27]	<Joelito>	maco: Hi, When I put the CD in the cd-rom, the cd-rom stops reading during the ubuntu banner with progressbar, but only the cd-rom light keeps on.
[none]	[00:27]	<fdsjkalf>	maco, you assume i know its release day. anywho, cool. new releases are great
[positive]	[00:27]	<alienbrain>	x1250, I see, but I can only install from the CD at the moment, not very good bandwidth :)
[none]	[00:27]	<Baughn>	"nibsa1242b: ""Trivial"", you mean. Normally it takes no effort at all."
[none]	[00:27]	<sandfisch>	is it possible to update the beta to full?
[none]	[00:27]	<maco>	Joelito: does it get to the menu part?
[none]	[00:27]	<tanath>	phiqtion, odd. they're in mine. you might try xmms2 though.
[positive]	[00:27]	<alienbrain>	So guys, thank you a lot. I will give it a chance! :)
[positive]	[00:27]	<cwillu>	alienbrain, then wait for a day or two :p
[none]	[00:27]	<sean_>	sandfisch: Just do regular updates and you're all set!
[none]	[00:28]	<jjt001>	maco: i'm trying to install dansguardian, and i need the cgi-bin directory?
[none]	[00:28]	<tanath>	sean_, no, shouldn't need xgl. i don't anyway
[none]	[00:28]	<Joelito>	maco: yes
[none]	[00:28]	<RyanPrior>	sandfisch: It is certainly possible. Regular updates will do the trick 100%.
[none]	[00:28]	<Joelito>	maco: I choose language and keyboard language
[positive]	[00:28]	<alienbrain>	cwillu, nah, I will just go ahead now, can't wait :D
[none]	[00:28]	<nibsa1242b>	sandfisch: in the past the beta/ RCs updated automatically with the regular updates
[none]	[00:28]	<maco>	fdsjkalf: see the topic? and the front page of ubuntu.com (if it's up?)? and the announcement on the forum? and the mailing lists? and every ubuntu blog on the planet?
[none]	[00:28]	<Dason>	joelito i had that same problem

[none]	[00:28]	<bingofuel>	can anyone can help me installing ubuntu with a sata disc_

[none]	[00:28]	<Dason>	burn another disk at a slower speed
[none]	[00:28]	<sandfisch>	thanks all
[none]	[00:28]	<alienbrain>	x1250, yep
[none]	[00:28]	<Joelito>	Dason: How do you fixed it?

[none]	[00:28]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: what is your problem?
[none]	[00:28]	<phiqtion>	tanath: servers are being hammered right?
[none]	[00:28]	<alienbrain>	maco, any idea how can I precisely tell what the problem is coming from?
[none]	[00:28]	<maco>	jjt001: oh.  i dont know.  itd involve apache webserver...id say ask the ubuntu christian edition people. they install it by default

[none]	[00:29]	<metanil>	hello
[none]	[00:29]	<maco>	Joelito: do a cd test
[positive]	[00:29]	<cwillu>	x1250, alienbrain, you can update from cd, but any packages that are missing won't be updated, and may break in spectacular explosions with shock wave effect
[positive]	[00:29]	<Starnestommy>	IntangibleLiquid: possibly
[positive]	[00:29]	<Ertyle>	IntangibleLiquid: yes
[none]	[00:29]	<fdsjkalf>	maco, whether or not your assumption seems reasonable, it wasnt accurate

[none]	[00:33]	<simonft2>	??
[none]	[00:33]	<goat|work>	hmm,  I wonder why the hardy update manager will not check the CD before requesting files from the repos... I have the CD option set in the software sources, and inserted...  anyone know if this is a known issue?

[positive]	[00:40]	<talntidwrk>	Dason, not if you don't want to run Windows apps ;)
[none]	[00:40]	<Dason>	Lol
[none]	[00:40]	<rich_freecomm>	"""About 22 hours 33 minutes remaining"" awesome"
[positive]	[00:41]	<talntidwrk>	but, i don't know ;)
[none]	[00:41]	<Dason>	It's more for the unpacking of them
[none]	[00:41]	<x1250>	Dason: it shouldn't be necessary
[none]	[00:41]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: same thing
[none]	[00:41]	<DEstlund>	I'm having trouble installing Heron - had the same problem with the betas: it complains that every file does not match the one on the disk. My cd burner works fine with everything else, so do my hard drives. Anybody seen this?
[none]	[00:41]	<Dason>	For use in Windows
[none]	[00:41]	<burner>	OzFalcon: i assume it depends on the fedora partition type
[none]	[00:41]	<x1250>	doesn't work for you Dason?
[positive]	[00:41]	<jPratt>	lol Well you knoe most things that are made are for Windows and well i like my Photoshop :P
[none]	[00:41]	<Datalanche>	"Hi. I just tried to do a fresh install of Hardy on my computer. I have two drives and two optical drives on my motherboards IDE controller, and three more hard drives on my Silicon Image-based PCI-IDE card. It is detecting the Sil-card's drive first(hda, hdb, and hdc). After the install, all I get is a screen full of ""﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ﻿GRUB ..."" What can I do to fix this?"
[positive]	[00:41]	<Dason>	Crystal xp
[positive]	[00:41]	<bingofuel>	je i was playing like a grub wizard but my magic is bad :p,
[none]	[00:41]	<bingofuel>	tell me your idea...if doesn-t work no problem
[none]	[00:41]	<OzFalcon>	burner, ext3
[none]	[00:41]	<Dason>	killled my dlls and I lost mah windows Cd
[none]	[00:41]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: yep, looking to see what else i can turn up
[none]	[00:41]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: cool thanks
[positive]	[00:42]	<altj>	damn, I've been seeding kubuntu images all day and just started seeding ubuntu images.  There's a bit of a difference in demand :-)
[none]	[00:42]	<OzFalcon>	Can hardy resize ext3 partitions?
[none]	[00:42]	<maco>	Datalanche: did the install complete?
[none]	[00:42]	<Dason>	SOOOOO... I can't install anything without opening in WINE and moving to Windows
[none]	[00:42]	<Fishscene>	lol altj
[none]	[00:42]	<Datalanche>	maco: Yes, finished fine and I clicked restart.
[none]	[00:42]	<jPratt>	Course we all know regular Ubuntu=Pwnage given by the Linux Gods
[none]	[00:42]	<ng0n>	o.. i got your notes here.. .sorry.
[none]	[00:42]	<sven_oostenbrink>	What exactly is the difference between 64 bits ubuntu and 32 (ignoring the obvious)? is 64 bits faster? could it cause problems with compatibility? will all (32 bits) programs work without problem on 64 bits?
[none]	[00:42]	<sean_>	"tanath: I have integrated intel graphics and compiz isn't working. I'm using the ""intel"" driver. Any ideas?"
[none]	[00:42]	<Datalanche>	maco: In Gutsy, my onboard IDE drives were hda and hdb. Now they are all sdX
[none]	[00:42]	<dmg46664>	I have downloaded the hardy CD for safe keeping in case of new installations, but I want to merge the packages on it with our local apt-cache, so local machines can all upgrade without all downloading 9 hours worth of packages each. Where can I find docs on how to do that?
[none]	[00:42]	<FrankH>	hi. what is the new package name for vim-full?
[none]	[00:42]	<ryanpg>	yay! Hardy Heron! Boo! my canon camera still doesn't automount - anyone have tips on getting this feature back? It was in the early betas...
[none]	[00:43]	<derspankster>	installed Hardy Server on a box I put together and I am totally lost
[none]	[00:43]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: you on gutsy or hardy?
[none]	[00:43]	<Datalanche>	whereas before just the ones on the sil card were sdX
[none]	[00:43]	<maco>	Datalanche: thats normal.thats a libata change
[none]	[00:43]	<Dason>	(shell32 was moved with some UI in Windows modifications)
[none]	[00:43]	<erat123>	ubuntu 8.04 comes w/ a browser in beta?!!?  what's the deal???
[none]	[00:43]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: gutsy
[none]	[00:43]	<tanath>	sean_, did you use displayconfig-gtk to try different drivers?
[none]	[00:43]	<maco>	Datalanche: are any of the drives reporting themselves wrong to the bios?
[none]	[00:43]	<Jack_Sparrow>	!aptoncd > dmg46664
[none]	[00:43]	<biabia>	maco yay ! the notes are there. thanks
[none]	[00:43]	<maco>	Datalanche: i know there are issues with sata drives that tell the bios to pretende they're IDE
[none]	[00:43]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: I tink I might have something for you to help... hold on a min
[none]	[00:43]	<x1250>	erat123: firefox3 should be there
[positive]	[00:43]	<sean_>	tanath, unfortunately. :-\ I also checked my graphics card and it says intel should be the one
[none]	[00:43]	<Mike_T>	HowTO : Get better than 800x600 in vn 5700 using live cd - no xorg options on boot?
[none]	[00:43]	<tanath>	sean_, test different drivers and after each working one, run 'glxinfo | grep -i direct' to see if direct rendering is enabled
[none]	[00:43]	<Datalanche>	maco: Nope, I watched them all pop up, they seem to be going in just fine. Oh, and also, they are IDE drives, not SATA
[none]	[00:43]	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b ok
[none]	[00:43]	<Jack_Sparrow>	maco, I am running on sata pretending to be ide here
[none]	[00:44]	<tanath>	sean_, i dunno. might try google & ubuntu forums
[none]	[00:44]	<zado>	firefox 3 beta 5 is good enough for release
[none]	[00:44]	<ng0n>	is the new Ver out.  I got Gusty
[none]	[00:44]	<jPratt>	Yes it is
[none]	[00:44]	<maco>	Datalanche: theyre *all* IDE? all more than 5?
[none]	[00:44]	<Dason>	Mike T restricted drivers in System > admin
[none]	[00:44]	<sean_>	tanath: is there any way to add displayconfig-gtk to my main menu? It used to be in admin
[none]	[00:44]	<erat123>	x﻿1250: god i hope i didnt get the wrong version...
[none]	[00:44]	<eternalis1>	maco i got some error
[none]	[00:44]	<fdsjkalf>	is it true that ff3 uses an ugly bold font for the URL
[none]	[00:44]	<ng0n>	hmmm. ok.
[none]	[00:44]	<Datalanche>	maco: Yes, I have five IDE hard drives.
[none]	[00:44]	<eternalis1>	maco: it says i have to check my internet connection, but im connected so wtf?
[none]	[00:44]	<tom_>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.
[none]	[00:44]	<jPratt>	ng0n yes hardy is out
[none]	[00:44]	<Dason>	wow, there's the background update!
[none]	[00:44]	<fdsjkalf>	thats reason enough to not use it
[none]	[00:44]	<rich_freecomm>	Greetings Scunizi
[none]	[00:44]	<erat123>	so, does firefox beta come w/ hardy or the finished release?
[none]	[00:44]	<maco>	Jack_Sparrow: the problem is when you have lots of IDE and it gets confusing when the OS sees lots of IDE due to that bios setting
[none]	[00:44]	<tanath>	sean_, menu editor?
[none]	[00:44]	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink: I highly recommend 32 bit. Not everything works out of the box with 64 bit that does with 32 bit. And there should be 5% or less performance difference between the two unless you are running a machine with >4GB of RAM.
[none]	[00:44]	<ng0n>	Hardy.  I like the sound of that.
[none]	[00:44]	<maco>	Datalanche: you cant do that
[none]	[00:44]	<Jack_Sparrow>	eternalis1, Please do not use that shorthand..
[none]	[00:44]	<noodles12>	firefox beta 5
[none]	[00:44]	<Dason>	erat, the finish for F3 isn't out yet
[none]	[00:45]	<eternalis1>	Jack_Sparrow: do you have a solution, or are you going to sass me?
[positive]	[00:45]	<maco>	Datalanche: i dont know how else to explain it but...5 IDEs just cant go
[positive]	[00:45]	<sean_>	tanath: nevermind. I'm blind. :)
[positive]	[00:45]	<tanath>	XD
[none]	[00:45]	<maco>	Datalanche: its a bug
[positive]	[00:45]	<Datalanche>	maco: Uh, yeah I can. I have two connect on the motherboard's IDE controller, and three on a PCI expansion card.
[none]	[00:45]	<OzFalcon>	erat123, Beta5, But you can download prev stable release if you want.
[none]	[00:45]	<Datalanche>	oh, really
[none]	[00:45]	<ng0n>	flash, sass and white trash : welcome to #ubuntu !
[none]	[00:45]	<x1250>	ff3 is ok, but it doesn't use pulseaudio. That feature was pushed to ibex, instead.
[none]	[00:45]	<DEstlund>	anybody seen persistent CRC errors on hardy install from cd?
[none]	[00:45]	<goat|work>	Jack_Sparrow: was banned?
[none]	[00:45]	<bingofuel>	nibsa1242b you-re saying that i have to install the 32 bits version_
[none]	[00:45]	<erat123>	that's too bad.    when i go to ubuntuguides.org, my X session logs off under firefox beta5....   i might have to downgrade firefox
[none]	[00:45]	<maco>	Datalanche: on ubuntu, 5 IDEs just cant go
[positive]	[00:45]	<Mike_T>	Dason: None listed...:-(
[none]	[00:45]	<goat|work>	sorry, nvm
[none]	[00:45]	<Datalanche>	maco: It was working just fine in Gutsy
[none]	[00:45]	<erat123>	i sent in a bug report, but didnt hear back
[none]	[00:45]	<Dason>	hmm...
[none]	[00:45]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: check and see if there's an update available for libgtk2; a couple of people reported that as fixing the problem for them
[none]	[00:46]	<joh6nn>	does anyone know how to make screen behave more like xterm, with regards to termcap/terminfo stuff?  when i use vim inside of screen, i occasionally get some weird behaviour
[none]	[00:46]	<IntangibleLiquid>	fdsik -l /dev/sda says cannott open /dev/sda: what should I do?
[none]	[00:46]	<maco>	Datalanche: regression....its a known bug on hardy though
[none]	[00:46]	<tanath>	talntidwrk, found it: netselect-apt
[none]	[00:46]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: that was for someone else... there is nothing wrong with 64 bit version, however, most people I know and myself prefer the 32 bit version for ease of use
[none]	[00:46]	<Dason>	intang - Are you using Sudo?
[none]	[00:46]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: libgtk2 is the name on repos?
[none]	[00:46]	<OzFalcon>	Too much noise....
[none]	[00:46]	<ng0n>	64 bit.  drivers ?
[none]	[00:46]	<Datalanche>	I don't understand.
[none]	[00:46]	<Datalanche>	it was never a problem before
[none]	[00:46]	<jvai_>	no straight upgrade from dapper to hardy in 09'?
[negative]	[00:47]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: anyhow... http://www.supergrubdisk.org/ should help you boot
[none]	[00:47]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: not sure, the posts don't say for sure
[none]	[00:47]	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: you should be able to go from Dapper to Hardy
[none]	[00:47]	<Dason>	IntangibleLiquid are you using sudo fdisk ?
[none]	[00:47]	<ng0n>	i'm too nube to 64
[none]	[00:47]	<capo>	so the repo's are all still down?
[none]	[00:47]	<tanath>	gah, aptitude wants to autoremove all my xmm2 plugins. why?!
[none]	[00:47]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: thanks i found it, installing now
[none]	[00:47]	<IntangibleLiquid>	﻿Dason: no, but thanks, it shows the partitions
[none]	[00:47]	<jvai_>	"aaw ""CLAPPIN""...  ty IndyGunFreak"
[none]	[00:47]	<Jorophose>	IndyGunFreak: Would you just follow the same procedure then? (update-manager -d)
[none]	[00:47]	<phiqtion>	XMMS2 has no GUI? is there a starter guide for HARDY?
[none]	[00:47]	<Gman99999>	has the downloading of the upgrade stopped for anyone else?  is the server possibly down?
[none]	[00:48]	<tanath>	phiqtion, audacious is very similar to xmms
[none]	[00:48]	<capo>	yeah i think the repo's are down
[none]	[00:48]	<DBautell>	the only thing I remember having to fiddle with was getting the 32 bit firefox
[none]	[00:48]	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: Jorophose i never done it, but i'm almost 100% certain, you can go from 1 LTS version, to another LTS version, w/o loading up the versions in between
[none]	[00:48]	<nibsa1242b>	bingofuel: you'll need to download the CDROM or USB version
[none]	[00:48]	<capo>	i can't download any packages
[none]	[00:48]	<Gman99999>	ah wait here we go
[none]	[00:48]	<x1250>	Gman99999: just pick a mirror
[none]	[00:48]	<joh6nn>	Gman99999: the repos are choked
[none]	[00:48]	<IntangibleLiquid>	﻿Dason: the sad thing is, Partition Editor says my current harddisk space is unallocated
[none]	[00:48]	<DBautell>	for flash, etc
[none]	[00:48]	<blbrown>	im back, I got the 8.04 iso CD download, but I dont see any cdromupgrade.  is there somewhere I should look for that
[none]	[00:48]	<tanath>	capo, there's plenty of mirrors
[none]	[00:48]	<ng0n>	my Vista found out i was doing Ubuntu and I swear, it has straighted up a little.  is that possible ?
[none]	[00:48]	<Dason>	Gman999999                          System - Admin Softy Sources - Alternative sources - scan for best
[none]	[00:48]	<maco>	Datalanche: and in hardy it is a problem.  things changed and it got broken.  thats all there is to it
[none]	[00:48]	<jvai_>	IndyGunFreak,  it should hold reason from one LTS to another.. right?
[none]	[00:48]	<rich_freecomm>	mine is still puttin away.....of course it says I have about 48 days left
[none]	[00:49]	<dmg46664>	Jack Sparrow: Thanx for the link to aptoncd... however I think what I was looking for was apt-cache-import
[none]	[00:49]	<maco>	Datalanche: hopefully itll be fixed by 8.04.1 in june, but maybe it wont
[none]	[00:49]	<Jorophose>	IndyGunFreak: What are the odds of it going bang in my face?
[none]	[00:49]	<IndyGunFreak>	jvai_: one would think.. google it though, i'm almost 100% SURE OF IT.
[none]	[00:49]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: they are the latest versions
[none]	[00:49]	<jvai_>	'k
[none]	[00:49]	<Dason>	IntangibleLiquid I suggest using an external disk drive editor then
[none]	[00:49]	<joh6nn>	ng0n: yeah, but if that's what it takes to make Vista behave, is it worth keeping around?
[none]	[00:49]	<sven_oostenbrink>	nibsa1242b> 64bits is slower?
[none]	[00:49]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: ; (
[none]	[00:49]	<IndyGunFreak>	Jorophose: don't really know, never done it.... try googling it... i install every 6mo
[none]	[00:49]	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink:  DBautell: yes, Firefox and extensions and Wine are the two main things that I find are easier to use in 32bit... one can always run the 32bit version on a 64 bit system but it takes time
[none]	[00:49]	<Dason>	Such as GParted
[none]	[00:49]	<tanath>	Jorophose, follow the guide in the topic and  you should be good
[none]	[00:50]	<nibsa1242b>	sven_oostenbrink: I think 64bit is marginally faster... but it depends
[none]	[00:50]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: did this used to work and suddenly broke, or did it never work?
[none]	[00:50]	<thedonvaughn>	ng0n: yah it's a feature.  If you install a linux kernel greater than 2.6.24, vista knows and it tweaks it's parameters (tm)]
[none]	[00:50]	<hansin>	ng0n: Yeah, I head there is a bit of code in Vista that detects if you are dool-booting Linux, and if so it runs better.  I guess MS must have figured if your dual boot Linux, that Vista better shape up in case you might make the full switch.
[none]	[00:50]	<Datalanche>	hmmmm
[none]	[00:50]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: it worked yesterday
[none]	[00:50]	<Mike_T>	hansin: lol
[none]	[00:50]	<pifedo>	Hi! My sound isn't working.. I have an Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 02), but alsa can't find any sound card. What can I do?
[none]	[00:50]	<Jack_Sparrow>	dmg46664, several options available
[none]	[00:50]	<Datalanche>	Well then, I dunno what to do if I can't use Hardy on my computer.
[none]	[00:50]	<joh6nn>	linkmaster03: so what'd you do to break it between now and then? : )
[none]	[00:50]	<Light|DC>	t/hop
[none]	[00:50]	<ng0n>	hansin: I knew it !@!
[none]	[00:51]	<Gman99999>	is wine even a viable method for installing popular windows aps I sure hear alot of people preaching how much better linux is than windows but Ive had so much trouble with simple hardware drivers that pissed me off alot, what makes linux so good?
[none]	[00:51]	<jwwadk>	hello all. this may sound like a noobish problem: my screen brightness options have disappeared
[none]	[00:51]	<unop>	joh6nn, you might need 'altscreen on'
[none]	[00:51]	<blbrown>	sh: Can't open /media/cdrom0/cdromupgrade ... wtf
[positive]	[00:51]	<linkmaster03>	joh6nn: nothing xD
[none]	[00:51]	<tanath>	pifedo, hardy uses pulseaudio now...
[none]	[00:51]	<eternal_p>	Gman99999: go to www.winehq.com and look for the app in question
[none]	[00:51]	<Dason>	Gman, to be king, yes
[none]	[00:51]	<pifedo>	tanath: So, What can I do? My sound isn't working any way...
[none]	[00:51]	<hansin>	ng0n:
[none]	[00:51]	<joh6nn>	unop: just throw 'altscreen on' in my .screenrc ?
[none]	[00:51]	<maco>	Datalanche: stick to gutsy
[none]	[00:51]	<ng0n>	hah
[none]	[00:51]	<Myke516>	Hey everyone
[none]	[00:51]	<tanath>	hansin, o.O have a source for that?
[none]	[00:51]	<Dason>	How can we help
[none]	[00:51]	<Datalanche>	Too late
[none]	[00:51]	<Datalanche>	I just wiped it
[none]	[00:52]	<Gman99999>	are there lots of bugs still in hardy heron?
[none]	[00:52]	<jPratt>	whats LTS stand for
[none]	[00:52]	<Datalanche>	heh
[none]	[00:52]	<thedonvaughn>	Gman99999: it's not made for easy plug-n-play.. even tho ubuntu tries that.  Sometimes you gotta manually install or setup a driver if that company who makes that piece of hardware doesn't give a linux driver for free and or hardware calls to developers to include in kernel.
[none]	[00:52]	<DBautell>	nibsa1242b, sven_oostenbrink, I seem to remember the BOINC people saying the speed difference is negligible, and even sometimes negative. Never occured to me that that might be part of my wine diffculties
[none]	[00:52]	<SeaPhor>	Gman99999, you can send me a tell and if i know i'll discuss it with you
[none]	[00:52]	<Dason>	Long Term Service
[none]	[00:52]	<fdsjkalf>	im going to try hardy today, i may even continue to use it
[none]	[00:52]	<unop>	joh6nn, aye, yes .. but i'm just stabbing in the dark - what exactly is vim doing in screen?
[none]	[00:52]	<FrankH>	﻿what is the new package name for vim-full?
[none]	[00:52]	<hansin>	ng0n: I was just kidding with you.  I highly suspect it is not related, at least not intentionally so.  But that would be funny.
[none]	[00:52]	<pifedo>	Gman99999: Oh yes! A LOT OF!
[none]	[00:52]	<tanath>	pifedo, you could make sure you have all the pulseaudio stuff you need, and remove the alsa & other stuff
[none]	[00:52]	<jwwadk>	does anyone know how to manually change screen-brightness?
[none]	[00:52]	<phiqtion>	does anyone know how to run XMMS2 on hardy?
[none]	[00:52]	<tanath>	pifedo, seems to have worked for me
[none]	[00:52]	<ng0n>	hansin: ya, i get it.
[none]	[00:52]	<lewench>	!upgrade
[negative]	[00:52]	<ubotu>	For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[none]	[00:52]	<ng0n>	hey.. it was FUNNY
[none]	[00:52]	<Dason>	Screen Brightness is a Monitor setting
[none]	[00:52]	<unop>	phiqtion, xmms has been replaced by audacious
[none]	[00:52]	<tanath>	jPratt, long term support
[none]	[00:52]	<fdsjkalf>	i found a mirror thats serving hardy to me at 1150+ KBps
[none]	[00:52]	<hansin>	tanath: Yeah, isdualbootlinux?.dll.
[none]	[00:52]	<nibsa1242b>	Gman99999: I only use WINE to visit sites in IE that refuse to work with firefox, opera, or Konq. And that doesn't always work so well so I revert to kqemu.

[none]	[00:52]	<fluidd>	Hello.  Anyone point me to anything for power management?  8.04.. trying to throttle my processor in my laptop.

[none]	[00:59]	<tanath>	e2, 'gksu displayconfig-gtk' to make sure you have the right driver installed

[none]	[01:00]	<nibsa1242b>	bododo_: I can't help you there... haven't been able to upgrade. I'm waiting for the repos to be less swamped.
[none]	[01:00]	<unop>	bradlis7, it can be, but xorg can work without one
[none]	[01:00]	<e2>	It's an old 128 Mb NVidia card.  Worked just fine with compiz on 7.10.

[none]	[01:00]	<doug2266778822>	 why do the animations not work in compiz?
[none]	[01:00]	<jjt001>	Dason: you just need to look harder

[none]	[01:00]	<anathematic>	Ertyle: yeah i think i might wait anyway ty
[none]	[01:00]	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: but the solution should be the same, right?
[none]	[01:00]	<bradlis7>	is there another file?
[none]	[01:01]	<unop>	bradlis7, you could create one i guess
[none]	[01:01]	<x1250>	bradlis7: it is, but its minimal because xorg tries to autodetect things. You can edit it by hand, its your choice
[none]	[01:01]	<ng0n>	5200 ?
[none]	[01:01]	<bododo_>	nibsa1242b: can I pm you, please?

[none]	[01:24]	<sammy>	Zasch: it's probably having a hard time talking to the servers, mine did that too. try running aptitude and picking a closer mirror to download from.

[none]	[01:24]	<mohbana>	without using wubi
[none]	[01:24]	<sammy>	Zasch: I mean synaptic, not aptitude.

[negative]	[01:26]	<dny>	well i knew they were busy, but i didn't know if that'd be the reason.  mine doesn't crash like everyone elses seems to do, it just doesn't show any new updates. :/
[none]	[01:26]	<simonft2>	bmk789: nope
[none]	[01:26]	<bazhang>	bmk789: what extensions yo have loaded
[none]	[01:26]	<goat|work>	anyone know why  the hardy update manager will not check the CD before requesting files from the repos... I have the CD option set in the software sources, and inserted, and I've unchecked the internet sources in the gutsy software sources
[negative]	[01:26]	<cabrioleur>	fsufitch, also, here http://sernaonubuntu.wikidot.com/multiple-monitors is an interesting article how to modify xorg.conf (based on integrated intel card)
[none]	[01:26]	<simonft2>	bmk789: much less than ever
[none]	[01:26]	<sammy>	Zasch: synaptic package manager should be easy to find, look with the other administration tools. you're going to open the 'repositories' item in the menus, and there should be a drop-down list to select your mirror. you can then select 'other' and click the button to find your closest mirror.
[none]	[01:27]	<Shpook>	Daisuke_Ido: Sorry, I meant to mention that I tried that and it didn't work.

[none]	[01:28]	<linkmaster03>	thanks Starnestommy

[negative]	[03:07]	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: i installed everything, but when i go to http://localhost/wordpress, it tries to download a phtml file
[none]	[03:07]	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, yep... i know, but i just want to see it prompt me for an upgrade, i just wanted to see if it worked... btw, what's the best way to upgrade?
[none]	[03:07]	<professor_>	KyleK, how do I switch the mirros
[none]	[03:07]	<juano__>	kubuntu 8.04 out already ?
[none]	[03:07]	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, should I use bittorrent to download the release?? and then mount it via loopback?
[none]	[03:07]	<Odd-rationale>	juano__: yes
[none]	[03:07]	<harsha>	Pelo: ok, I was asked to create a swap drive while installation of Ubuntu, is it required only while installation or that space will be used even after installation?
[none]	[03:07]	<myf>	sorry for repeating but my update-manager won't response after i press the upgrade button, anybody knows why?
[none]	[03:07]	<KyleK>	professor_: its under settings
[positive]	[03:07]	<juano__>	Odd-rationale: thanks :)
[none]	[03:07]	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, would that be best? (in terms of not using ubuntu server's bandwidths)
[none]	[03:07]	<KyleK>	like Settings -> Software Sources
[none]	[03:08]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, take a paperclip, unbend it ,  look on the cd drive face, just below the try , little pin point  hole,  sick the papeclip in it and puch
[none]	[03:08]	<favoritefood0>	I did that.
[none]	[03:08]	<favoritefood0>	That's how I know it's empty.
[none]	[03:08]	<Skuller>	Hey guys, I'm trying to install 7.10 on a school PC but it ends up being at the terminal sort of prompt and it says 'busybox' at the top. I tried 7.04 and it works sweet. Any suggestions?
[none]	[03:08]	<professor_>	KyleK, Im sorry Im a noob , how do I do
[none]	[03:08]	<favoritefood0>	If I put in a disk, it doesn't spin up.
[none]	[03:08]	<c0mp13371331337_>	navreet-  Bittorrent would probably be the fastest at this point, as the Ubuntu servers/mirrors are all bogged down at the moment.  Which may be why it doesn't prompt you to upgrade right away.  They may give a few days for all the manual-upgraders to get it out of their system before rolling out the option to upgrade to the general public.
[none]	[03:08]	<Pelo>	harsha, it's used after ,  make it about 2xram  max 2 gig
[none]	[03:08]	<Stroganoff>	Skuller, press ctrl+alt+f4
[none]	[03:08]	<nickrud>	Skuller when you boot, do f6 (?) and try some of the boot options
[none]	[03:08]	<navreet>	c0mp13371331337_, got it
[none]	[03:08]	<juano__>	Skuller: whats the hardware for that pc ?
[none]	[03:09]	<thiebaude>	8.04 is nice
[none]	[03:09]	<KyleK>	professor_: System -> Admin -> Softwar Sources
[none]	[03:09]	<Skuller>	Ok I'll try that right now
[none]	[03:09]	<Venko>	Hey, I'm having some issues replacing the gnome-main-menu image in Hardy. I've tried the gconf-editor method and directly replacing the file. After both times I've reloaded gnome-panel with no success.
[none]	[03:09]	<GerbilSoft>	ah ha
[none]	[03:09]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, might be a bad drive ,  might be a problem with the strap,  might be badly pluged in ,  turn off the comp, open the box, check the connections make sure the power cabloe and the data strap are not damaged
[none]	[03:09]	<GerbilSoft>	apparently the alternate install CD no longer works for network boot
[none]	[03:09]	<KyleK>	and in the middle where it says like USA click that and choose a different mirror, kernel.org is what im using atm
[none]	[03:09]	<GerbilSoft>	so i have to manually get the alt install initrd
[none]	[03:09]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, it works perfectly in Bios.
[none]	[03:09]	<Venko>	Is this a Hardy bug or am I doing something wrong?
[none]	[03:10]	<favoritefood0>	It worked perfectly 15 mins ago in Feisty.
[none]	[03:10]	<p0w3r0n3>	unzip -a on a .exe in ubuntu hardy... fails... how do i fix this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[none]	[03:10]	<favoritefood0>	It's DEFINITELY something in Hardy.
[none]	[03:10]	<Skuller>	juano__: its a p4 3.ghz, 1gb RAM, PC, custom complied
[positive]	[03:10]	<Shadow_X>	wow this is bad. i just installed xp on my old machine (for using photoshop and other windows based apps i need) and it has no generic driver for my NIC :|
[none]	[03:10]	<harsha>	Pelo: I have 1 GB of ram that means I have to allote 2 GB for swap drive, am I correct?
[none]	[03:10]	<woddf2>	Hello
[none]	[03:10]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, you can open/close your cd/dvd ddrive from the bios ? that' sa new one to me
[none]	[03:10]	<woddf2>	Update Manager keeps hanging!
[none]	[03:10]	<Stroganoff>	p0w3r0n3: sudo apt-get install unzip
[none]	[03:10]	<lopin>	Actually, manually selecting a mirror close to home is working nicely...
[none]	[03:10]	<Pelo>	harsha, yes
[positive]	[03:10]	<Ubuntong>	erat123: I'm no expert but make sure PHP is installed correctly. maybe install myphpadmin so you can make sure it's working.  A kind of shortcut is to install egroupware since it's requirements are PHP, Apache2, Mysql. So you will get everything installed correctly.
[none]	[03:10]	<TheDukeNY>	How do I had my internal hard drive to my desktop?
[none]	[03:10]	<lopin>	Go to software sources, and select a mirror that's closer to you
[none]	[03:10]	<TheDukeNY>	*add
[none]	[03:10]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, as the computer is going through BIOS, I can hit the open/close button and it will open or close the drive.
[none]	[03:10]	<juano__>	Skuller: hmm ok, was thinking maybe you forgot to check if it was x64 architecture, cause in that case you need to download the x64 cd
[none]	[03:10]	<rich_freecomm>	ahhh
[none]	[03:10]	<Pelo>	woddf2, it's release day the servers are under heavy loads,  get the torrent for the alternate install cd and upgrade from that
[none]	[03:10]	<harsha>	Pelo: Thanks for the help.
[none]	[03:11]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, the drive also worked perfectly 15 mins ago in Feisty.
[none]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stronganoff, its already installed?
[none]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stronganoff, any other ideas?
[none]	[03:11]	<Skuller>	By the way the problem I mentioned arises when trying to boot off the live version of the OS
[none]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stroganoff, any other ideas?
[none]	[03:11]	<lopin>	Pelo:  I couldn't get that to work, but switching to a local server helped TREMENDOUSLY!
[none]	[03:11]	<p0w3r0n3>	Stroganoff, already installed
[none]	[03:11]	<Pelo>	favoritefood0, I don't have an answer for you , report the bug to launcpad
[none]	[03:11]	<erat123>	﻿Ubuntong: i'll give that a try and see where it goes.  i went to their site, and it looks cool.  i've just never heard of it.  sorry i cant really help you with your problem though.
[none]	[03:11]	<favoritefood0>	Pelo, Okay.
[none]	[03:11]	<Shadow_X>	Pelo, can you perform a standard upgrade from the alternate cd?
[none]	[03:11]	<lopin>	Shadow_X
[none]	[03:11]	<HardyOne>	Shadow_X: yes
[negative]	[03:11]	<DBautell>	Shadow_X, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[none]	[03:11]	<KyleK>	hey can I upgrade from feisty to hardy?
[none]	[03:12]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 you should do   tail -f /var/log/syslog , try inserting a disk, and including the output in your report
[none]	[03:12]	<shane2peru>	anyone know anything about a DVD iso for ubuntu (of course the 8.04 edition)
[none]	[03:12]	<favoritefood0>	Oh, pelo, get this, Sysinfo detects the drive just fine.

[none]	[03:13]	<MachinTrucChose_>	X-chat is the nicest client so far...LostIRC has no features, neither does Xchat-Gnome. Konversation's pretty cool too, but I guess everyone was right to recommend X-chat.
[none]	[03:13]	<shane2peru>	Thanks DBautell
[positive]	[03:13]	<sammy>	lopin: I've been trying to tell people once I changed my mirror everything went quickly, but I guess there is something to wanting more iso discs out there :)
[none]	[03:13]	<professor_>	KyleK, no where do I find the mirror
[none]	[03:13]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 ooohh, sounds hardware. The disk tray action should have nothing to do with the os

[none]	[03:14]	<favoritefood0>	nickrud; I just upgraded from feisty.
[none]	[03:14]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: then try pidgin/gajim/kopete/etc with an irc plugin or a jabber server with an irc gateway.
[none]	[03:15]	<Millertime_018>	how can i get vmware-server to show up in the add/remove box?
[none]	[03:15]	<shane2peru>	DBautell, hmm, seems as that there is a traffic jam at that site.
[none]	[03:15]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 I know, but we're talking about current troubleshooting info
[none]	[03:15]	<taxman>	yago: after you got that message, you were able to shutdown normally with no errors? And now what exactly happens? What do you mean by can't do anything?
[none]	[03:15]	<moon2js>	Can I do a dist-upgrade but have it access the repos from a CD?
[none]	[03:15]	<sammy>	MachinTrucChose_: pidgin and gajim actually both do really well with irc transports on jabber servers. so does psi
[none]	[03:15]	<ffm_>	Millertime_018, Just remove it via synaptic.

[none]	[03:16]	<nickrud>	favoritefood0 so, try booting a cd. See if you get different action at that level.

[none]	[03:16]	<ffm_>	bmoll8, It works well, much better than the prior one.
[none]	[03:16]	<MachinTrucChose_>	basically an IRC client needs to have a decent interface (with a list of users! can't believe some didn't have that), syntax highlighting, DCC sends, CTCP suites, aliases...it's very minimal stuff that was already in mIRC 10 years ago

[none]	[03:17]	<Daedius_>	hey all
[none]	[03:17]	<Shadow_X>	Kl4m, i think it was due to ignorance about linux in general. ive learned alot more lately. i used to be daunted by the thought of linux, but now, im comfortable with is. almost as comfy as i am on windows (which i have spent my whole life on, sadly)

[none]	[03:17]	<shane2peru>	what advantage is there having the DVD?  More packages, is it the alternate CD and the DesktopCD install wrapped into one?

[none]	[03:18]	<Daedius_>	for 64bit system
[none]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	shane2peru, If you have a fast internet connection, the DVD offers little adcantage.

[none]	[03:31]	<sammy>	Arnos: I don't think they do booster floopys like that anymore now that they figure everyone can just dl and burn a cd, or that anyone wanting to do that could just make their own bootable floppy. are you still trying to load the update from usb?

[none]	[03:40]	<nickrud>	scorpfromhell probably slow servers

[none]	[03:46]	<dan_l>	Do i need to get the alternate or just the standard image?
[none]	[03:46]	<Kl4m>	scorpfromhell: It seems you can install ubuntu on it, not only xubuntu.
[none]	[03:46]	<jordanjay29>	Fa: Personally, I think Gnome has better qualities than Windows and KDE. Nautilus could be better, but I'll ta.ke a crum(b)y navigation over stupid glitches and bad interface any day

[negative]	[03:47]	<DBautell>	dan_l, To Upgrade from the CD/ISO, you'll need the alternate ISO or the DVD: run cdromupgrade from the root of the CD/ISO/DVD. If you don't want to/can't burn a disc, you can 'mount -o loop nameofiso /path/to/mount/'
[none]	[03:47]	<fyrfaktry>	I pulled the x64 cd in about 15 minutes
[none]	[03:47]	<ricree>	my numberkeys stopped working after the upgrade.  Does anyone have any idea how to troubleshoot?
[none]	[03:47]	<jordanjay29>	osvin: yes, just install all the KDE packages and libraries. Then log out, select KDE from the Options/Sessions menu, and log in
[none]	[03:47]	<jburd>	Yeah, the torrents are definitely faster.  Don't bother with the HTTP servers dan_l

[none]	[03:48]	<ricree>	JoCoProductions: you might want to try the alternate installer
[none]	[03:48]	<jordanjay29>	fdsjkalf: Give it a few days, it's release day today. Servers are going to be slow for a while.
[none]	[03:48]	<dan_l>	DBautell: ive never booted an alternate CD, does it just leave you with a bash shell?

[none]	[03:54]	<kilrae>	is it just me, or does the installer seem to lack a way to mount an encrypted volume without erasing what is in it?

[none]	[03:55]	<Kl4m>	ripps: are you coming from #ubuntu+1 ? if so you've just been redirected to #ubuntu

Anyways, I've never had a problem with it in the past, but it kicked me back to the login screen a couple of times. So, I put the settings back to ""Simple"". Now, whenever I open a window, it leaves a ""ghost"" image of it's ""glide"" effect."

[none]	[04:56]	<snadge>	Jack_Sparrow: yeah but how do i tell it to use generic IDE? i can do it from the install cd.. but not sure what option to put in my menu.lst
[none]	[04:56]	<nhaines>	pipegeek: update-manager passes everything over to a special release upgrade tool that does dependancy checking and so forth.
[negative]	[04:56]	<mattycoze>	harriseldon no there is no placeholder for the card :(
[none]	[04:56]	<quentusrex>	Does anyone know about the color bug on hardy? I think it has something to do with either the nvidia driver or something similiar.

[none]	[05:05]	<Deiz>	So, as with every time I install Ubuntu, windows maximize to both my monitors instead of one. Is there a workaround? I recall with 7.04 I got lucky after a reboot and it started working properly.
[none]	[05:05]	<bladezor>	x1250, yeah I didn't notice how
[none]	[05:05]	<led3234>	mostly stuff like word, powerpoint

[none]	[05:06]	<nhaines>	led3234: It's actually a quite pleasant change if you mostly do email, browse the Web, and do Office stuff.  You can always download a Desktop CD and try things out a bit without installing.

[none]	[05:08]	<maap_rj>	hi guys.
[none]	[05:08]	<harriseldon>	owen1 as long as you know the ip of the server, the ip of the client can be dynamic
[none]	[05:08]	<ricree>	n000b: as far as I know, the only huge difference is that it uses KDE instead of gnome
[none]	[05:08]	<Kalimar>	Samba trouble.  My windows computers are recognized, but when I click on them, they are devoid of shares.  What's wrong?
[none]	[05:08]	<Kl4m>	"thezanke: in the first lines of the file /boot/grub/menu.lst (edit it as a superuser, see !sudo), change the line ""default      0"" to ""default    saved"". Reboot, select Windows and from now on it will be the default"
[none]	[05:08]	<Flannel>	n000b: They're different.  Neither has advantages per sey, just a matter of preference.
[none]	[05:08]	<nhaines>	n000b: There are no advantages.  It uses the KDE desktop environments instead of the GNOME desktop environment.  It's just about preferences.  They can both run run the same programs.
[none]	[05:08]	<maap_rj>	somebody updated to ubuntu 8.04?
[none]	[05:08]	<talcite>	n000b: its a preference thing. If you're used to KDE, then its better
[none]	[05:09]	<led3234>	oh ok, but i thought there was that new thing in the update (kubi, i think) that lets me run ubuntu from windows (as an application), should i try it?

[none]	[05:09]	<ricree>	when I try to use pulseaudio for sound, I get no sound.  Any suggestions?

[none]	[05:09]	<maap_rj>	is the 8.04 much better than 7.10?
[none]	[05:09]	<talcite>	talcite: its a download manager that a lot of distros are moving to. Its specialized for .isos. There's jigit in the backport repos

[none]	[05:10]	<led3234>	oh ok
[none]	[05:10]	<talcite>	manuel__: k. Yeah, don't use jigdo jigdo. It doesn't work very well yet. Use jigit and then use jigdo-lite (I think that's what its called)

[none]	[05:11]	<Kl4m>	thezanke: you can remove the group of lines for each entry you don't want around the end of that file (oh boy I shouldn't be telling you that)
[none]	[05:11]	<Kalimar>	Nope, is there one?
[none]	[05:11]	<maap_rj>	I really hope not be necessary re-configurate so many things manually

[positive]	[05:12]	<nhaines>	thezanke: the best way is to remove the kernel packages using Synaptic.  It's a good idea to leave the old one around for a week or so, just in case you find any bugs.  :)
[none]	[05:12]	<maap_rj>	this is my first time using a IRC chat... lol it is cool

[none]	[05:12]	<cob>	er Lainy
[none]	[05:13]	<Flannel>	thezanke: You can't remove them permanently, they'll show up as soon as you update your kernel again.  What you want to do is remove old kernel packages, then those entries won't be there anymore.  It's always a good idea to have two kernels (a known good one, and then the new one you just updated to) in case you find bugs

[none]	[05:28]	<Flannel>	arooni: now; except you'll be waiting forever on slow mirrors.  Give it a few days.
[none]	[05:28]	<nhaines>	arooni: It should work right now, but I'd advise you to wait a week or at least a couple days.

[none]	[05:42]	<harriseldon>	jeffimperial the mountpoint is the destination directory. on linux drives are mounted to a directory on the filesystem

[none]	[05:42]	<kindofabuzz>	neeto: get in line, you are only the 1 millionth person doing the same thing
[none]	[05:42]	<harriseldon>	jeffimperial, just create a new directory and use the full path as the mount point
[none]	[05:42]	<neeto>	kindofabuzz: figured it was something like that
[none]	[05:42]	<joetheodd>	Stupid question -- are the repositories down or are they just really bogged thanks to the release today?
[none]	[05:42]	<kindofabuzz>	omg
[none]	[05:42]	<hellmitre>	bogged down.
[none]	[05:43]	<Sniper606>	i think they are down
[none]	[05:43]	<Flannel>	jeffimperial: mountpoint would be an arbitrary place in your filesystem that you wanted the ISO to be mounted to (so you browse to /whatever/your/mountpoint/is/ to view the contents of the CD/iso)
[none]	[05:43]	<pawbie>	Alright, 8.04 must have serious issues with RAID.
[none]	[05:43]	<Sniper606>	im having the repository problem too

[none]	[05:53]	<MeatGrinder>	So why use alternate CD instead of just doing internet upgrade?
[negative]	[05:53]	<ubotu>	Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[none]	[05:53]	<patspam>	nhaines: it's in /media/cdrom0, but again /media/cdrom0/cdromupgrade doesn't exist
[none]	[05:53]	<zero88>	pawbie, what does that do exactly?
[none]	[05:53]	<loufoque>	Pokit: window borders are independent from the gtk theme
[none]	[05:53]	<Kurtis->	I've tried ndiswrapper
[none]	[05:53]	<pawbie>	zero88: records from the mixer.
[none]	[05:53]	<MrObvious>	Did someone forget to package ndiswrapper utils with Hardy?
[none]	[05:53]	<Pokit>	loufoque, is it possible to use GTK2 themes with compiz fusion?
[none]	[05:53]	<Kurtis->	no, it's there
[none]	[05:53]	<rich_freecomm>	Anyone here have Konversation?
[none]	[05:53]	<Kurtis->	in repositories, at least
[none]	[05:53]	<nhaines>	MeatGrinder: because the alternate CD can be downloaded via BitTorrent and the official repositories are really, really being hammered right now.
[none]	[05:53]	<Flannel>	MeatGrinder: you download as a torrent, instead of from the mirrors (which are especially slow right now)
[none]	[05:54]	<loufoque>	Pokit: sure
[none]	[05:54]	<nhaines>	patspam: Are you sure you're using the alternate install CD and not the desktop CD?
[none]	[05:54]	<MrObvious>	I'm trying to make my BCM94311 work and need ndiswrapper since the b43 drivers won't install here.
[none]	[05:54]	<pawbie>	nhaines: All of the CDs are available by torrent.
[none]	[05:54]	<Kurtis->	MrObvious same chip as I
[none]	[05:54]	<patspam>	nhaines: bugger i think i have the desktop cd
[none]	[05:54]	<nhaines>	pawbie: He was only talking about the alternate install CD.
[none]	[05:54]	<dave11>	rich_freecomm: #kubuntu
[none]	[05:54]	<Kurtis->	tried ndiswrapper myself, and it didn't work
[none]	[05:54]	<nhaines>	patspam: A common mistake.  I run into it myself occasionally.
[none]	[05:54]	<patspam>	nhaines: download wasted? or possible to still use?
[none]	[05:54]	<MeatGrinder>	i hate torrents, so damn slow and the seeding part I don't like so much. Aren't torrents just for transmitting viruses and trojans?
[none]	[05:54]	<Kurtis->	Of course, is there any way to disable the native drivers?

[none]	[05:55]	<IcemanV9>	patspam: dl alternative cd torrent then. it's fast. you can use desktop for later.
[none]	[05:55]	<pawbie>	MeatGrinder: If you're serious, I'm going to headdesk.
[none]	[05:55]	<osmosis>	what is 'enable watching' do for tracker ?
[none]	[05:55]	<Starnestommy>	AdrianStrays: you probablt messed up more things by using envy

[none]	[05:55]	<harriseldon>	AdrianStrays did you use envy or envyng

[none]	[05:55]	<Pokit>	"loufoque, I guess i just dont understand how it works. when I download a GTK2 theme from the web, and drag it into the theme window and apply the theme, it doesnt ""really"" change.  the theme stays as clearlooks but the hue of the window border changes.."

[negative]	[05:56]	<blueeyesmike>	i've been looking just now best I could find was this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/188194 but when I do that log I don't get any button press events from gnome-power-manager like this guy did
[none]	[05:57]	<pawbie>	AdrianStrays: Envy is one of those great things that...  when it works, it works great.  When it fails, it epic fails.  Sounds like you just have a slight fail at the moment, though.
[none]	[05:57]	<pipegeek>	Okay, I'm confused by this.  The upgrade is failing because it would have to remove nvidia-glx-new, but xserver-xorg-core conflicts with nvidia-glx-new

[none]	[05:57]	<nhaines>	patspam: My pleasure.  Torrents are a way to download from many people who are downloading a file.  It is popular for large files because it means that bandwidth is shared between downloaders.  Consider leaving your BitTorrent client running afterwards, to help out others who still need Ubuntu!

[none]	[06:19]	<Kurtis->	How would I blacklist the b43 driver from loading for my Broadcom chip? I want to use ndiswrapper
[none]	[06:19]	<talcite>	tawt: the server versions don't have X11 by default
[none]	[06:19]	<Y-Town>	Do the Europe and German mirrors to download 8.04 have english version or are they in other languages by default?

[positive]	[06:19]	<talcite>	tawt: If you aren't clear on the differences, I'd say desktop is the one you want =D
[none]	[06:19]	<Kurtis->	"but would I just list ""b43""?"

[positive]	[06:19]	<Sciri>	tawt: Desktop has a GUI for home/office/notebook users. Server has no GUI for, well, servers like Web and database. ;)
[none]	[06:19]	<tawt>	lol  yeah.  just curious
[none]	[06:19]	<Kurtis->	cob: would I just type b43 in there?

[none]	[06:19]	<FastZ>	unop: Ubuntu server comes with LAMP packages by default now?
[none]	[06:19]	<pawbie>	fastz: Ya?  I figured server precompiles were the same as desktop kernels.
[none]	[06:19]	<jeffimperia1>	Just mounted the alternate ISO for hardy.. now, which do i execute? the cdromupgrade md5?
[none]	[06:19]	<talcite>	ahh. server edition's pretty fun. I threw it onto an old machine to play around with
[none]	[06:19]	<samliu>	Kurtis, what kind of card do you have
[none]	[06:20]	<talcite>	its interesting
[none]	[06:20]	<unop>	FastZ, yep
[none]	[06:20]	<cob>	Kurtis-: whatever is loaded up, check lsmod, I would say be sure b43-legacy or anything else with b43 in the name is blacklisted

[none]	[06:20]	<Kurtis->	bcm4311 rev 2

[none]	[06:20]	<mattycoze>	oh ok
[none]	[06:20]	<KyleK>	cos the syntax in /blacklist is blacklist b43
[none]	[06:20]	<gogeta>	unop: ubuntu has roaches lol lots of bugs
[none]	[06:20]	<mattycoze>	amirman84 reckon it'll be right if i change the server?

[none]	[06:20]	<LainIwakura>	Kurtis- I have a bcm4311 too. Should I blacklist b43 and use ndiswrapper?
[none]	[06:20]	<FastZ>	pawbie: nah, the server kernel has is hardened a little and has some other stuff... i'm not 100% up to speed on the differences, but i know there are some slight inequalities between the two versions
[positive]	[06:20]	<unop>	gogeta, i can't say i am surprised :) it's well, expected
[none]	[06:20]	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: I have no idea
[none]	[06:20]	<samliu>	yeah blacklist b43
[none]	[06:21]	<Cpudan80>	Hello all
[none]	[06:21]	<samliu>	you have ndiswrapper set up?
[none]	[06:21]	<Cpudan80>	I've got a wierd problem
[none]	[06:21]	<Radiobuzz>	I'll try to add it manually to the list, we'll meet again if something goes wrong. Thanks pawbie!
[none]	[06:21]	<amirman84>	you shouldn't need to use terminal commands at all. just allow those sources and update through the GUI
[none]	[06:21]	<Kurtis->	I don't even see b43 listed in here
[none]	[06:21]	<ceil420>	"iusegnulinux, i have ""About 16 hours 6 minutes remaining"" to install Hardy <_<"
[none]	[06:21]	<Y-Town>	Do the Europe and German mirrors to download 8.04 have english version or are they in other languages by default?
[none]	[06:21]	<Cpudan80>	So I just upgraded to hardy --- but now the number pad (on the keyboard) wont work
[none]	[06:21]	<talcite>	uhh... sorry why is everyone here saying blacklist b43?
[none]	[06:21]	<LainIwakura>	not sure how to blacklist it or setup ndiswrapper
[none]	[06:21]	<samliu>	no you have to add it
[none]	[06:21]	<FastZ>	unop: when did LAMP become standard package install?  with 7.10 it wasnt default I dont think...or was it?  i did a dist-upgrade for that version
[none]	[06:21]	<pawbie>	Radiobuzz: grub-install shouldn't be damaging if you want to try it.  G'luck.
[none]	[06:21]	<cob>	Kurtis-: ssb?
[none]	[06:21]	<ceil420>	(finally got dist-upgrade to work)

[positive]	[06:21]	<^V^>	nickrud: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64311/
[none]	[06:21]	<talcite>	as of the 2 6 24 kernel, b43 should be the one to use. Ndiswrapper is pretty terrible. bcm43xx is even worse
[positive]	[06:21]	<Y-Town>	nickkewl, the mirrors are faster  :o)
[none]	[06:21]	<ceil420>	FastZ, when did emacs become a standard package install? i don't even want the program ;x
[none]	[06:22]	<cob>	Lainlwakura: not sure you want to go that route yet...unless you really want to
[none]	[06:22]	<Kurtis->	cob: yes, ssb
[none]	[06:22]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: How can I get b43 to work?

[none]	[06:22]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: i used to use ndiswrapper for 7.10, and am now on 8.04 - should i use b43 then?

[none]	[06:23]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: depends on your card. Ndiswrapper is good if you happen to be using the MN-720
[none]	[06:23]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Take the pcspeaker out.

[none]	[06:23]	<ceil420>	FastZ, if you're asking why i mention it to you, it's because you also mentioned a new package in the install

[none]	[06:24]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: that's using the new wireless stack. You should be using b43 if possible

[none]	[06:24]	<FastZ>	ceil420: oh, i couldnt tell ya why some packages are installed by default.  unop said something about the server version being a LAMP server installation by default.

[none]	[06:25]	<nickrud>	^V^ did you get the question about showing me the output of   sudo fdisk -l ?
[none]	[06:25]	<pawbie>	I haven't used Ubuntu in a year...

[none]	[06:25]	<eugenebythesea>	talcite: it usually worked well previously in 7.10. i haven't tried it yet in 8.04
[none]	[06:25]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I never had this problem before.  Before I updated to Hardy, video works, graphics worked, no lines or anything.  I have trouble believing this is a hardware issue.  Furthermore, prior to using envy, compiz and videos worked fine.
[positive]	[06:25]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, i was, but it was because i had broken packages installed (in my case, a few language packs). i removed the offending packages, and i'm upgrading now :)

[positive]	[06:26]	<Shadow_X>	ceil420, heh i'm upgrading for several reasons. but of course, they always say its the best version ever. then again, any developer says that :P
[none]	[06:27]	<FastZ>	unop: if i remember correctly, you had the option at initial installation to install the LAMP server...or a regular server

[none]	[06:27]	<Kurtis->	oh, lovely

[none]	[06:27]	<nick_>	Ubutu 7,1 is cooll
[none]	[06:27]	<hellmitre>	nothing goes into the panel
[none]	[06:27]	<talcite>	eugenebythesea: your card isn't supported by b43 yet. I'd say stick with ndiswrapper for awhile longer until they release support. Keep looking every few months though. Ndiswrapper is a sub-optimal solution
[positive]	[06:27]	<unop>	FastZ, well, if you install and use tasksell , you have the option on any ubuntu/debian machine :)

[none]	[06:28]	<ceil420>	FastZ, a LAMP server is more or less 'regular'. i don't know why it'd be without the 'A' part, seeing as Apache rocks (and is probably the most ubiquitous server software out there)

[positive]	[06:31]	<Shadow_X>	jim_beam, i would think not. although im not sure. i expect the upgrade tool would handle packages with no problem. however, if you have problems with X afterwards, I would advise you to reinstall them then
[none]	[06:31]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, nevermind

[positive]	[06:32]	<bullgard4>	nickrud: I like mc very much. Particularly for its clear arrangement and small footprint.

[none]	[06:33]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Ah, no, just use dd.  Boot the wubi install, prepare a partition on a physical disk, then dd if=wubipartition of=mynewpartition and walk away for a while.
[none]	[06:33]	<Shadow_X>	lol im already having problems. the upgrader complains about unsupported packages and stops >.>

[positive]	[06:35]	<ceil420>	Shadow_X, that sounds about like what i had. check the /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log (i think that's the one) and see which packages are failing. i only had four files in that folder (and one of them was blank), so it won't take too long to go through them all :p
[none]	[06:35]	<gogeta>	supersako envy = bad

[none]	[06:35]	<Johnny_>	i burned twice
[none]	[06:35]	<pawbie>	amirman84: Oh.  Good luck.  You can dd to a network location and then restore from there?
[none]	[06:35]	<supersako>	Tabasco what do u have to do?
[none]	[06:35]	<nickrud>	^V^ ok,  Me, I'd mount it at /mnt and simply copy over all the stuff in boot on the root to the /boot partition
[none]	[06:35]	<nick_>	how do i get amarok
[none]	[06:36]	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, does ndiswrapper not have a website to tell you the latest version?
[none]	[06:36]	<LainIwakura>	same.. i can't get online to apt-get
[none]	[06:36]	<Pradalvr>	seamus7 I'm there and don't know how to use it
[none]	[06:36]	<gogeta>	Johnny_: md5 iso make shure its not bad
[none]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	nick_: apt-get install amarok ?
[none]	[06:36]	<ricree>	nick_: synaptic or apt-get

[none]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	nick_: Try exaile

[none]	[06:36]	<Johnny_>	what is md5 iso
[none]	[06:36]	<nick_>	so whats the best
[none]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	Baxtor: Just reformat it.  No need to do the other steps.
[none]	[06:36]	<amirman84>	pawbie: so is dd or ghost basically creating an image of my disk?

[none]	[06:36]	<Kurtis->	I prefer KDE myself and am actually using Kubuntu, but my problem isn't Kubuntu-specific.
[none]	[06:36]	<PFC_Tabasco>	supersako: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment your restricted repos, apt-get update and then go the the Hardware Drivers option in System->Administration
[none]	[06:36]	<Shadow_X>	Baxtor, i believe using GParted would solve those issues
[none]	[06:36]	<Baxtor>	can you just use Gparted?
[none]	[06:36]	<seamus7>	Pradalvr: are you dual booting with Windows or installing Ubuntu on a maching by itself?
[none]	[06:36]	<pawbie>	"amirman84: Ya.  The trick with the wubi bit, though, is that you need to boot wubi to ""see"" your wubi install."
[none]	[06:36]	<amirman84>	supersako: i was born in 84 but in Iran
[none]	[06:36]	<gogeta>	Baxtor yep
[none]	[06:36]	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420> hm. i could find out about that - but what i really want to know - if .. is that version suitable for hardy?
[none]	[06:36]	<Baxtor>	cheers
[none]	[06:37]	<talcite>	kindofabuzz: I see. I doubt we'll get a .deb for it soon though. I don't think there's anything you can do in the mean time
[none]	[06:37]	<Johnny_>	thanx for the afvice
[none]	[06:37]	<ceil420>	eugenebythesea, hmm. try apt-cache showpkg ndiswrapper <=- i think that's the command to show you Ubuntu's current version of the package
[none]	[06:37]	<Johnny_>	srry i am new to irc
[positive]	[06:37]	<eugenebythesea>	<ceil420> cool =) thanks for that

[none]	[06:37]	<talcite>	Kurtis-: I'm not sure which patch its referring to. We're on a pretty recent version of 2.6.24. Have you tried b43 with the firmware?
[positive]	[06:38]	<gogeta>	dystopianray i dunno ask google :P
[none]	[06:38]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ no problem If I may, I'd suggest you use   xchat   for irc, works better out of the box than pidgin does
[none]	[06:38]	<Baxtor>	ahh... unmount the drive so you can re-format it.. silly baxtor *duh*
[none]	[06:38]	<Kurtis->	I downloaded the b43-fwcutter package
[none]	[06:38]	<amirman84>	pawbie: when i was looking at where wubi is installed from windows i noticed that there are quite a few ISO's it seems like i should be able to install ubuntu brand new on the partition and restore my system from those ISOs... is that possible?

[none]	[06:40]	<AdrianStrays>	ripps, I did what you said, and videos work now.  However, the resolution is screwed up and compiz was off.  Restarted compiz and was prompt to install ATI Accelerated Drivers, I'm going to restart now and see if the resolution is better

[none]	[06:40]	<nickrud>	Johnny_ you need to be more specific. What is anything?

[positive]	[06:40]	<Shadow_X>	nick_ its in the design of linux itself. its Unix based. so its built securely from the ground up. its a difficult thing to explain unless you have a solid foundation in computer/network security
[none]	[06:40]	<samliu>	if it isn't the bad iso, I think it might have to do with either ram or if its an old computer

[none]	[06:42]	<ceil420>	zero, conky was designed to be embedded to the desktop. if it's not there when you run it, you're doing it wrong :o

[none]	[06:43]	<SecretGirl>	zero, where do i type that
[none]	[06:43]	<Koheleth>	anyreason why Konversation takes a while to start in Hardy Heron?
[none]	[06:43]	<zero>	ceil420, its in a window on all my computers
[none]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	nick_: Unix isn't open source

[none]	[06:43]	<samliu>	mikebot
[none]	[06:43]	<kindofabuzz>	so you'd blacklist the two things but un blacklist bcm43xx
[none]	[06:43]	<mikebot>	samliu: Yes.
[none]	[06:43]	<samliu>	ah
[none]	[06:43]	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, many Unices are open source; OpenSolaris, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc
[none]	[06:43]	<samliu>	thats why
[none]	[06:43]	<samliu>	the alt CD doesnt have the live bootup
[none]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	Well, yeah
[none]	[06:43]	<Kurtis->	But THE Unix isn't
[none]	[06:44]	<mikebot>	samliu: I'm sorry?
[none]	[06:44]	<pawbie>	samliu: No GUI.
[none]	[06:44]	<ceil420>	zero, weird :o i've never even seen it have a window of it's own. look at the .conkyrc's they have on the conky home page and see how they have theirs set up
[none]	[06:44]	<samliu>	right
[none]	[06:44]	<red_>	hi..got a problem with my internet speed. downloading and web browsing is very slow. usually my speed is 20kbps now its 6kpbs sometimes below than that. any help pls...
[none]	[06:44]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: no idea how to do it.. i'm really a novice
[none]	[06:44]	<samliu>	so it can install in situations the normal disk may come across issues
[none]	[06:44]	<samliu>	which is a good reason why Johnny_ should try it
[none]	[06:44]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: have you compiled a binary from source before?
[none]	[06:44]	<samliu>	unless people have better suggestions lol
[positive]	[06:44]	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, Bell Labs' UNIX(R) isn't, no :p
[none]	[06:44]	<Johnny_>	ok does anyone have any advise
[none]	[06:44]	<usser>	nick_, i'd say different heritage, most unixes go way back whereas linux is a pretty recent thing
[none]	[06:44]	<pawbie>	talcite: What are binary?
[none]	[06:44]	<Johnny_>	that i will know how to do
[none]	[06:45]	<zero>	ceil420, what?
[none]	[06:45]	<SecretGirl>	zero, f5 is for accessibility options, is that the one
[none]	[06:45]	<pawbie>	Johnny_: samliu mentions trying the alt CD.  Did you try that?
[none]	[06:45]	<ceil420>	Kurtis-, and actually, i think their original Unix was open source. they went closed source later on (maybe as late as System V)
[none]	[06:45]	<kindofabuzz>	linux is only 10 years old
[none]	[06:45]	<mikebot>	Can someone hep me with upgrading from the alt CD?
[none]	[06:45]	<Kurtis->	hmm
[none]	[06:45]	<LainIwakura>	talcite: i know how to type ./configure and make. does that count?

[none]	[06:45]	<Johnny_>	pawbie: binary is the language that the computer naturally understands it is made of 1 and 0s
[none]	[06:45]	<Seveas>	ceil420, nope, Bell Labs' Unix was always closed iirc

[none]	[06:45]	<samliu>	er
[none]	[06:45]	<talcite>	LainIwakura: please don't forget which changes you make by the way. You'll have to undo them to test other methods.

[none]	[06:45]	<eugenebythesea>	ceil420, talcite: the latest ndiswrapper in the repos is 1.50 - so i'll just go with that. blacklisting b43 and getting my driver now
[none]	[06:45]	<SecretGirl>	zero, f5 is for accessibility options, is that the one

[none]	[06:45]	<Kurtis->	LainIwakura: have you installed build-essential?

[none]	[07:15]	<Tweaker>	Hola, I got a question about another game...Its called Eclipse and it allows you to build your own ORPG and I've got it working, but I can't enter the admin panel with the F1 button, why is this?
[none]	[07:15]	<AdrianStrays>	Nickrud, I believe it has something to do with xorg.conf
[none]	[07:15]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker is it native or through Wine?
[none]	[07:15]	<Tweaker>	Through Wine
[none]	[07:16]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays crldb maybe, one of those meaningless character strings. He's already in bed probably, but is around nearly daily, for long periods
[none]	[07:16]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: that s weird...I can run it through the terminal
[none]	[07:16]	<SecretGirl>	dystopianray, the cd is fine i checked and there's no problem, its an original cd that i ordered
[none]	[07:16]	<zenlunatic>	the_darkside_986: i think SMP means dual core/multi procs
[none]	[07:16]	<damo22>	hi im trying to add cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
[none]	[07:16]	<SecretGirl>	does anybody know how to install ubuntu from the shell, step by step
[none]	[07:16]	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: still, it sounds like you'll need the alternate install cd
[none]	[07:16]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker F1 is already mapped in gnome, you need to change the mapping there first. Gnome hot keys will be use before wine
[none]	[07:16]	<h00k>	harriseldon: Well, I turned the drive off for a bit, moved the usb cables a little, and it works now, automount and all.
[positive]	[07:16]	<the_darkside_986>	yeah that's why i am worried. and it would explain the awful behavior of the whole system. but it doesn't act like that on the live cd
[none]	[07:16]	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, alright I'll try back in the morning
[none]	[07:16]	<mlw1>	anyone know what I might be doing wrong to have my display resolution overwritten on every reboot?
[none]	[07:16]	<Tweaker>	Ok, how do I do this Harriseldon.?
[none]	[07:16]	<jeanre>	does anyone have any ideas on this
[positive]	[07:16]	<h00k>	harriseldon: that scared me.  thanks for letting me think out loud about it ;)
[none]	[07:17]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays between you and me, I don't use compiz on my 1100, it's just to freaking slow
[none]	[07:17]	<jeanre>	my mode line does not work
[none]	[07:17]	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: all ubuntu is going to support SMP, so you're using the right one
[none]	[07:17]	<harriseldon>	h00k anytime, I am glad that it worked
[none]	[07:17]	<Aces|>	Anyone know if the Hardy Live CD has better Nvidia Graphics driver support than Gusty Gibbon did?
[none]	[07:17]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: try typing sudo apt-get install gedit
[none]	[07:17]	<ChrisULM>	got a problem with hardy, i have a panel with icons at the bottom of my desktop, but when i restart it moves the panel to the top. whats going on?
[none]	[07:17]	<NukeSkyjumper>	the_darkside_986: if performance isn't very good, you probably need to enable the nonfree video driver
[none]	[07:17]	<damo22>	hi im trying to add hardy cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
[none]	[07:17]	<nickrud>	Aces| it has the latest nvidia driver, while gutsy's was months out of date
[none]	[07:17]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: You already have that installed, but it will tell you where it chrashes
[none]	[07:18]	<the_darkside_986>	I already have the non-free nvidia driver setup. The whole system lags and startup time is extremely long.
[positive]	[07:18]	<zenlunatic>	Aces|: from my experience so far, yes.  all the multiverse etc is default
[none]	[07:18]	<knapsack_>	Anyone know if there is an eclipse PDT (PHP Development framework) package in any Ubuntu repos?
[none]	[07:18]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: it s not crashing
[none]	[07:18]	<Aces|>	ok thanks nickrud I just had quite a bit of troubling installing 7.10 with the live cd so I ended up having to use the alternate
[none]	[07:18]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"the_darkside_986: what do you mean by ""lags""?"
[none]	[07:18]	<Aces|>	Ok thanks

[none]	[07:18]	<AdrianStrays>	nickrud, I think I'll disable it for now, I'm just frustrated that I went from Gusty, where everything worked, to Hardy where all I've had is graphics issues. I was kind of hoping things would get better.  Thanks anyways
[none]	[07:18]	<Aces|>	Ill give it a try
[none]	[07:18]	<SecretGirl>	dystopianray, if there was a problem with cd, wouldn't the scan for defects return something
[none]	[07:18]	<Acoustyk>	Hardy is lagging!
[none]	[07:18]	<Kl4m>	the_darkside_986: generic kernel enables SMP only if it can. the SMP mention is because it supports it.
[none]	[07:18]	<jeanre>	why cant I run 1280x800?
[none]	[07:18]	<amazing_lady>	8.04 is cool
[none]	[07:18]	<Acoustyk>	anyone know any quick fixes for this?
[none]	[07:18]	<leonbrussels>	zelrikriando: So only synaptic is crashing?
[none]	[07:18]	<xepra>	anyone know xen well?
[none]	[07:18]	<zelrikriando>	leonbrussels: only from the taskbar
[none]	[07:18]	<Tweaker>	Does anyone know what the F1 key does in gnome so I can unassign it?
[none]	[07:18]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Acoustyk: obviously, you haven't given any details of the problem
[none]	[07:19]	<dystopianray>	SecretGirl: not if the problem is related to hardware incompatibilities
[none]	[07:19]	<the_darkside_986>	Everytime I start a process such as synaptic, it seems that it tries to hog the CPU and even the mouse cursor freezes for a while.
[positive]	[07:19]	<nickrud>	AdrianStrays all I can say is everything worked fine for me (beta install nearly 2 months ago, and updates since then. First time that Works for Me™ :)

[none]	[07:21]	<leonbrussels>	bye everybody, whish me luck for installing
[none]	[07:21]	<Acoustyk>	yea
[none]	[07:22]	<Shadow_X>	what would happen if i added the 8.04 cd to the 7.10 repositories in synaptic?
[none]	[07:22]	<the_darkside_986>	"A ""sudo apt-get update"" must be done to let non-free nvidia card drivers show up in the hardware manager if you didn't let the installer ""scan the mirrors"" during installation."
[none]	[07:22]	<Acoustyk>	no problems with the panel other than a slight delay
[none]	[07:22]	<Tweaker>	Uhm Im talking about the Panels in this game.F1 opens them and would alt F1 still affect the key mapping?
[none]	[07:22]	<devin_>	anyone know of a way to resize the terminal and keep it at your desired size?
[none]	[07:22]	<Acoustyk>	I found a tweak to solve the same problem in 7.10 tho
[none]	[07:22]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Shadow_X: you would be upgrading to Hardy, which does work. however, that usually causes little bugs here and there
[none]	[07:23]	<nickrud>	Acoustyk it's modifiable, in metacity at /apps/metacity/global_keybindings, and compiz in ccsm in general options, keybindings tab
[none]	[07:23]	<Shadow_X>	"NukeSkyjumper, just wondering. because i keep getting upgrade errors while trying to do a ""normal"" upgrade and im getting sick of it lol"
[positive]	[07:23]	<nickrud>	Acoustyk unless I've totally missed the question ;)
[none]	[07:23]	<Shadow_X>	i have my stuff backed up anyway, so im not too concerned about a failure during upgrade
[none]	[07:23]	<Acoustyk>	lol yea you did
[none]	[07:23]	<Acoustyk>	im having lag problems
[none]	[07:23]	<damo22>	hi im trying to add hardy cdrom to apt... i get E: Failed to mount the cdrom.
[none]	[07:23]	<nick_>	im on ubuntu 7.1 just installed it 2 days ago would upgrading to 8 be better is there better support
[positive]	[07:23]	<nickrud>	I threw in that caveat when I saw you say lag just before :)
[none]	[07:24]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"Shadow_X: if you edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and change ""gutsy"" to ""hardy"" and then upgrade all packages, you should get a working hardy system"
[none]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	monitors works via GUI in 8.04!!!
[none]	[07:24]	<Johnny_5>	so i guess the consensus is that gutsy may still be better than hardy
[positive]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	:)
[none]	[07:24]	<Acoustyk>	yea
[none]	[07:24]	<nickrud>	nick_ gutsy will have support for another year right here, as well as hardy
[none]	[07:24]	<Shadow_X>	hmm ok. i'll try that
[none]	[07:24]	<Johnny_5>	that's kinda what i've been gathering
[none]	[07:24]	<laiya>	hi
[none]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	"in 8.04 I cant enable ""normal"" effects"
[none]	[07:24]	<Wavesonics>	getting crash
[none]	[07:24]	<nickrud>	Johnny_5 I'm voting hardy big time
[none]	[07:24]	<nick_>	sweet
[none]	[07:24]	<Johnny_5>	heh
[none]	[07:25]	<laiya>	hey how do i cascade the windows ?
[none]	[07:25]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Wavesonics: do you have the nonfree video driver enabled?
[none]	[07:25]	<Johnny_5>	i'm just not convinced i need 2 upgrade from gutsy quite yet
[none]	[07:25]	<nickrud>	I've run every release, and breezy for me was the most trouble free one, but hardy is running close
[none]	[07:25]	<harriseldon>	Tweaker have you tried a virtual desktop with wine (use winecfg)? I am just guessing here since I do not know
[none]	[07:25]	<Wavesonics>	NukeSkujumper: I dont think so, should I?
[none]	[07:25]	<Tweaker>	Give me a second and I can try that
[none]	[07:25]	<Wavesonics>	I have an ATI card
[none]	[07:25]	<NukeSkyjumper>	Wavesonics: yeah, it'll enable 3d support
[none]	[07:25]	<nickrud>	Johnny_5 waiting a couple weeks is not a bad idea, just in case some bad bugs suddenly crop up and need fixing
[none]	[07:26]	<NukeSkyjumper>	though i'm not sure how much better the nonfree ATI driver is than the open source one
[none]	[07:26]	<Wavesonics>	ok
[none]	[07:26]	<NukeSkyjumper>	you should still try it
[none]	[07:26]	<ricree>	devin_: not that I know of.  However, the man page says that if you add --geometry=(number of chars horizontal)x(number of chars vertical) it will set your terminal to a specified size by default
[none]	[07:26]	<Johnny_5>	ah...
[none]	[07:26]	<nickrud>	Wavesonics if you have a 9550 or later, you will need the restricted one to run 3d apps
[none]	[07:27]	<laiya>	i recently saw a video of ubuntu where they were able to cascade the windows and it looked quite cool .. how does one do that ?
[none]	[07:27]	<devin_>	ricree ill give it a try
[none]	[07:27]	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Settings. it's in there, somewhere
[none]	[07:27]	<harriseldon>	laiya it may have been with compiz-fusion (aka desktop effects)
[none]	[07:28]	<NukeSkyjumper>	"laiya: though you probably need to ""sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager"" first"

[none]	[07:30]	<XceII>	interesting, mine has it
[positive]	[07:30]	<Lardarse>	nickrud: umm... that sounds like a step backwards...
[none]	[07:30]	<Prez00>	what's the feedback coming in, generally good, bad, average?
[none]	[07:30]	<NukeSkyjumper>	laiya: that app lets you configure all of the window managing effects
[none]	[07:30]	<ricree>	Acoustyk: Also, the top comand line utility will do that
[none]	[07:30]	<laiya>	oh ok

[none]	[07:41]	<nickrud>	julio_neto mostly, but you'll still need to get some packages from the net if you downloaded them during your gutsy run

[none]	[08:04]	<neeto>	Is there anyone in here that lost their 3d-windows/wallpaper plugin compatibility on compiz with their upgrade? Does anyone have a workaround?
[none]	[08:04]	<gharz>	dystopianray: i checked my synaptic and openoffice.org-java-common is already installed.
[none]	[08:04]	<biabia>	none of my firefox extensions were compatible

[none]	[08:05]	<dystopianray>	gharz: in openoffie's configuration have you set a jre for it to use?

[negative]	[08:08]	<GIn>	flash on linux is crap :(
[none]	[08:08]	<dny>	err
[negative]	[08:08]	<dny>	my sound keeps going out :/
[none]	[08:09]	<boeing>	reeeh2000, dint you get the popup when flash loaded first time to install flash?
[negative]	[08:09]	<gord>	http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/MD5SUMS
[none]	[08:09]	<jburd>	and why the heck does an upgrade restart have to fetch all the necessary files *again* from the internet?
[none]	[08:09]	<boeing>	the package which installs works perfect.
[none]	[08:09]	<Jordan_U>	GIn, Hardy uses PulseAudio by default but Adobe's flash plugin doesn't play well with pulseaudio, if you want to solve the problem of not being able to use flash and other things at once install libflashsupport but that may lead lash to be less stable
[none]	[08:09]	<reeeh2000>	boing: i did, it list several choices
[none]	[08:09]	<gharz>	"dystopianray: java version ""1.6.0_06 Java (TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_6-b02)"

[none]	[08:10]	<GIn>	Jordan_U: is libflashsupport the free flash alternative?
[positive]	[08:10]	<tparcina>	gord: I can't open that web page - time out :(
[none]	[08:10]	<boeing>	reeeh2000, use the adobe-flash plugin
[none]	[08:10]	<jburd>	upgrades networkless or networked should be PAINLESS not PAINFUL.
[none]	[08:10]	<Jordan_U>	GIn, No, it's a pulseaudio plugin specifically for nonfree flash
[none]	[08:10]	<reeeh2000>	boeing: ok, i just hate using adobes stuff is all, thabks
[none]	[08:10]	<boeing>	boeing, get the cd and insert. then upgrade feasibility will be listed immediately

[negative]	[08:11]	<GIn>	Jordan_U: but Pulseaudio is not in a stable state itself :(

[none]	[08:11]	<GIn>	wonder why ubuntu included such an important piece of software in beta state in the OS
[none]	[08:11]	<jburd>	ubuntu should start paying attention to the installation process more than adding tons of new features.  make that robust first.
[none]	[08:11]	<Jordan_U>	GIn, Pulseaudio is stable, it's just that the pulseaudio plugin for flash can cause flash to crash
[none]	[08:11]	<boeing>	jburd, remove all internet links in /etc/apt(?)
[none]	[08:11]	<nick_>	whats a good burning program

[none]	[08:12]	<boeing>	nick_, k3b
[none]	[08:12]	<DJones>	nick_: k3b or gnomebaker are normally pretty good
[none]	[08:12]	<neeto>	`mIRC`: In my humble opninion KDE is an ugly piece of crap that looks like a bargain bin windows knock off, and gnome is an original and beautiful piece of interface glory... but that's just me

[none]	[08:29]	<Daisuke_Ido>	Emof, reinstall from the repos
[none]	[08:29]	<Wavesonics>	I had dual monitors working with the default ATI drivers, then I couldnt do 3D desktop, so i installed the proprietary drivers, then I couldnt do dual monitor, so i went back to the default drivers, and now nothing works.
[none]	[08:29]	<Jordan_U>	Emof, How did you install them?
[none]	[08:29]	<icesword>	!find luxi fonts

[none]	[08:30]	<nikitis>	Flannel: I still get an error 13
[none]	[08:30]	<Jordan_U>	Wavesonics, I believe you have to actually remove fglrx ( the proprietary drivers ) because they are evil and mess up the open source ones
[none]	[08:30]	<iusegnulinux>	boot to ubuntu and repair grub
[none]	[08:30]	<Emof>	yeah, but I've tried with the normal drivers too
[none]	[08:30]	<Emof>	didn't work either

[none]	[08:31]	<Flannel>	nikitis: alright, pastebin your menu.lst, and the output of fdisk -l (that's an L), and I'll take a look.
[none]	[08:31]	<boeing>	please, remove ubuntu from windows first.

[none]	[08:31]	<raj1>	from grub menu
[none]	[08:31]	<iusegnulinux>	may be your windows partition is not the active partition anymore
[none]	[08:31]	<raj1>	ok can someone tell me about pastebin
[none]	[08:32]	<Flannel>	!paste | raj1
[negative]	[08:32]	<ubotu>	raj1: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[none]	[08:32]	<nikitis>	Flannel: ok, give me a moment to boot it up

[none]	[08:33]	<Zloog>	Hi, did something change in 8.04 to make it so that my samba share settings arent saved in /etc/samba/smb.conf anymore? The shares are working fine, but I dont see the share settings in the smb.conf file anymore.
[none]	[08:33]	<iusegnulinux>	tango

[none]	[08:34]	<Johnny_>	hey
[none]	[08:34]	<iusegnulinux>	i use nvidia proprietary driver
[none]	[08:34]	<kuru>	it keeps showing icons of the running apps and a bit of animation
[none]	[08:34]	<darryl>	how do you use the 32bit libraries for compiling?
[none]	[08:34]	<kuru>	which, if anything, is just plain annoying
[none]	[08:34]	<xepra>	man ubuntu's grub install is fubar
[none]	[08:34]	<kuru>	can't figure out how to get rid of it
[none]	[08:34]	<Johnny_>	I have downloaded a .tar.gz file but do not know how to install it. how can i do so?
[none]	[08:34]	<xepra>	I haven't gotten it to work out of the box once
[none]	[08:34]	<latitu>	i have hp deskjet 3900 printer. how can i see ink levels and have some advanced configs and printing quality levels . like in windows?
[none]	[08:34]	<Ziroday>	kuru: what do you want to change it to?
[none]	[08:34]	<Qrawl>	is ther a virtualization thing built in to Hoary
[none]	[08:34]	<raj1>	double click
[positive]	[08:34]	<raj1>	:)
[none]	[08:34]	<Flannel>	Qrawl: Hoary?
[none]	[08:34]	<darryl>	Johnny_: you have to extract the files and probably compile the program
[none]	[08:34]	<Wavesonics>	Jordan_U: I don't have that installed it says
[none]	[08:34]	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, Are you sure it's not available in the repos or as a .deb file?
[none]	[08:34]	<XceII>	lol hoary
[none]	[08:35]	<hugol1>	Ziroday:  launchpad is full of it. Since I installed hardy I cant install nvidia propietary drivers. Neither through Hardware drivers neither manually
[none]	[08:35]	<bobbie4>	well, it's time for bobbie to go to bed, night all!!!!
[none]	[08:35]	<Qrawl>	I mean Hardy
[none]	[08:35]	<hugol1>	and the max resolution I get is 800x600
[none]	[08:35]	<Hans>	I know a guy, who uses still Breezy Badger...
[none]	[08:35]	<Johnny_>	darryl: how do i compile it
[none]	[08:35]	<XceII>	heron
[none]	[08:35]	<`mIRC`>	what is the most suitable filesystem (ext1...ext2...ext3) to use for install ubuntu?
[none]	[08:35]	<tomasko>	wow there are so many trolls here tonight. more so than normal
[none]	[08:35]	<tomasko>	can't separate the noobs from the trolls either
[none]	[08:35]	<boeing>	Johnny_, extract the archive
[none]	[08:35]	<Zloog>	mIRC: ext3 is probably your best bet
[negative]	[08:35]	<nikitis>	Flannel: http://rafb.net/p/xR4JIF23.html
[none]	[08:35]	<xepra>	or xfs...
[none]	[08:35]	<Ziroday>	hugol1: don't know anything about that sorry, proprietary drivers work fine for me
[none]	[08:35]	<Hans>	He asked on wednesday, why he dont get any update anymore....
[none]	[08:35]	<Johnny_>	boeing: i extracted how do i compile it
[none]	[08:35]	<tomasko>	`mIRC`: ext2 for the kernel /boot and ext3 for any data you care about (like your home dir, etc.)
[none]	[08:35]	<darryl>	Johnny_: that depends on the program, normally it would be  sudo ./configure && make && make install
[none]	[08:36]	<`mIRC`>	Zloog : excuse me....why is that so?
[none]	[08:36]	<boeing>	"then go to a directory where u can find a file ""configure"""
[none]	[08:36]	<gnuskool>	screen resolution on an external monitor for laptops is a nightmare, help, i got intel 855 card
[none]	[08:36]	<kuru>	ziroday, to just switch to the other app
[none]	[08:36]	<iusegnulinux>	tried the binary installer?
[none]	[08:36]	<tomasko>	`mIRC`: no one uses ext1
[none]	[08:36]	<hugol1>	Ziroday:  ok
[none]	[08:36]	<Johnny_>	darryl: where do i even type this in
[none]	[08:36]	<Ziroday>	kuru: eh?
[none]	[08:36]	<iusegnulinux>	ext3 is cool
[none]	[08:36]	<boeing>	Johnny_, open a terminal and cd to that folder
[none]	[08:36]	<boeing>	./configure
[none]	[08:36]	<Johnny_>	boeing: what does cd mean
[none]	[08:36]	<kuru>	ziroday, no animation
[none]	[08:36]	<xepra>	'mIRC': ext3 is the slowest, but has the best failure recovery
[none]	[08:36]	<Flannel>	nikitis: and rootnoverify gives the same error?
[none]	[08:36]	<raj1>	change directory
[none]	[08:36]	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, Are you sure it's not available in the repos or as a .deb file?
[none]	[08:36]	<iusegnulinux>	change irectory
[none]	[08:36]	<boeing>	Johnny_, cd means change directory
[none]	[08:37]	<xepra>	'mIRC': jfs has the lowest cpu usage
[none]	[08:37]	<corbett>	hi, is there anyone who can help me get my maxtor external hard drive mounted and working on ububtu 7.10 - which ive just loaded on pc to replace windows, it worked perfectly fine elsewhere on widows, I think I need to run some checks as I dont know why it wont mount
[none]	[08:37]	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes it does
[none]	[08:37]	<Johnny_>	jordan: i am sure
[none]	[08:37]	<iusegnulinux>	reiserfs?
[none]	[08:37]	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, What are you trying to install?
[none]	[08:37]	<Johnny_>	jordan: apache
[none]	[08:37]	<nikitis>	Flannel: i assume you mean change root  (hd2,0) to rootnoverify  (hd2,0)
[none]	[08:37]	<Flannel>	nikitis: Have you tried adding 'makeactive' after the root line?
[positive]	[08:37]	<`mIRC`>	thanx you guyz for advice :D
[none]	[08:37]	<Flannel>	nikitis: I do.
[none]	[08:37]	<Qrawl>	so about my question, does Hardy have builtin virtualization
[none]	[08:37]	<Zloog>	mIRC: Your filesystem type usually doesnt matter too much. The only important thing is that it is journalizing, which ext3 is. Barring that, you don't need anything fancy unless you have a very particular need.
[none]	[08:37]	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
[none]	[08:37]	<Johnny_>	jordan: i have extracted to the desktop can u tell me exactly what 2 type in the terminal
[none]	[08:37]	<unop>	darryl, sudo ./configure && make && make install  probably wouldn't cut it ..  ./configure and make do not need to be run as root, make install does tho
[none]	[08:37]	<mcp_>	How do i disable Tracker? I already removed the Session-Entries. Trackerd still starts from time to time.
[none]	[08:37]	<gnuskool>	corbett: is it ntfs filesystem or linux filesystem
[none]	[08:37]	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes i believe so, i'll try again
[none]	[08:37]	<xepra>	'mIRC': they all have their advantages and disadvantages - there are some great benchmarks out there tho
[none]	[08:37]	<darryl>	hey does anyone know if you can compile lmms with vst support on a amd64?
[none]	[08:38]	<corbett>	gnuskool: ntfs
[none]	[08:38]	<boeing>	unop, he is new. he wont understand this lang.
[none]	[08:38]	<zigford>	extra chees
[none]	[08:38]	<boeing>	Johnny_, open a terminal
[none]	[08:38]	<Jordan_U>	Johnny_, It depends on what program you are installing, you may need to get dependencies for that specific program
[none]	[08:38]	<Zloog>	corbett: How did you try mounting it?
[none]	[08:38]	<darryl>	i've tried but it says my libstc++ is imcompatible, i think it has to do with it being 64bit, but how do you get it to use the 32bit libraries?
[none]	[08:38]	<iusegnulinux>	how to get write permission to ntfs partition?
[positive]	[08:38]	<`mIRC`>	thanx you guyz for advice :D
[none]	[08:38]	<Zloog>	^_^
[none]	[08:38]	<Johnny_>	jordan_U: it is appache and i have opened the terminal what do i type
[none]	[08:39]	<boeing>	"Johnny_, type cd ""/home/jo/directory"""
[none]	[08:39]	<backslash>	Is there something really new in Hardy? Had no time to upgrade yet
[none]	[08:39]	<nikitis>	Flannel: yes same error, with makeactive under root or rootnoverify
[none]	[08:39]	<boeing>	Johnny_, this will change the dir of the terminal
[none]	[08:39]	<iusegnulinux>	latest apps
[none]	[08:39]	<nikitis>	Flannel: you can see why i'm confused
[positive]	[08:39]	<Oprtz>	hello just install ubuntu 8.04 LTS and i love it, because it support my Intel 946GZ chipset and vga driver :) just want to ask how to minimize the screen resoultion, when ubuntu ask user name and password? after that i set my resoultion and ubuntu shift to that resoultion, thanks
[none]	[08:39]	<generic>	nay one works on gosa?
[none]	[08:39]	<boeing>	Johnny_, you have to hence change to the dir where a file called configure is located.
[none]	[08:39]	<XceII>	backslash:  it now has a kitchen sink
[none]	[08:39]	<corbett>	Zloog:   well ive just plugged it in, ive tried a mount command, but as im new , im not sure, ive only just loaded ubuntu
[none]	[08:39]	<boeing>	Johnny_, then type ./configure
[none]	[08:39]	<unop>	iusegnulinux, it should be as straight forward as a simple mount, what happens when you try and write to the partition?
[none]	[08:40]	<Johnny_>	boeing: i dont know what to type at all the file name is apache_1.3.4.1 and it is on the desktop can u put exactly what to type in quotes
[none]	[08:40]	<Xperiment62>	anyone here able to help me find a suitable IRC client, query if able to help
[none]	[08:40]	<Zloog>	Corbett: cool, If you go to your PLACES menu in X windows and then down to computer, you should see your drive listed in there
[none]	[08:40]	<boeing>	"Johnny_, this means ""execute configure"", in the current directory, in unix"
[positive]	[08:40]	<karbo>	Anyone else experienced this? I have managed to configure my ATI card to use dual screen, 2 desktops next to eachother, and this works fine on the login display. But as soon as I log in, it resets to cloned display.
[none]	[08:40]	<lalalala>	why is ubuntu so great?????????
[none]	[08:40]	<Zloog>	corbett: double click that and it should mount
[none]	[08:40]	<sleepster>	how would I get a drive to mount everytime I turn on my machine
[none]	[08:40]	<Johnny_>	boeing i am to confused
[none]	[08:40]	<iusegnulinux>	i can mount it, read it, but cant write
[none]	[08:40]	<boeing>	Johnny_, apache is easier to install.
[none]	[08:41]	<boeing>	u dont need to compile from source.
[none]	[08:41]	<Xperiment62>	anyone here able to help me find a suitable IRC client, query if able to help
[none]	[08:41]	<Johnny_>	boeing_i am trying to install apache
[none]	[08:41]	<unop>	iusegnulinux, yes, we gathered that much -- but what exactly happens when you try and write to it?
[none]	[08:41]	<Hikejinx>	I'm running Hardy on VirtualBox. Does anyone know of any tricks to get the restricted drivers to work on there? I can just install them in the cli I guess?
[none]	[08:41]	<Jordan_U>	"Johnny_, ""sudo apt-get build-dep apache2"" what is wrong with Ubuntu's version though?"
[none]	[08:41]	<Zloog>	Did something change in 8.04 to make it so that my samba share settings arent saved in /etc/samba/smb.conf anymore? The shares are working fine, but I dont see the share settings in the smb.conf file anymore.
[none]	[08:41]	<Flannel>	Xperiment62: Xchat, irssi, Konversation
[none]	[08:41]	<backslash>	XceII: yeah finally

[none]	[09:37]	<tobmalf>	what?
[none]	[09:37]	<MrWGW->	iknoia: if I just tell it to boot /vmlinuz, the kernel panics

[none]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, that's not an initrd.
[none]	[09:38]	<Koheleth>	btw can ubuntu be uninstalled?
[none]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	That's a kernel.
[none]	[09:38]	<Sajuukkhar>	i also have no mouse drivers

[none]	[09:38]	<MrWGW->	yes quite, and GRUB says that /initrd.img does't exist, even though it does

[none]	[09:38]	<Baughn>	Is there a netboot image for Hardy? There doesn't seem to be one on the cd I downloaded, like the howto suggests
[none]	[09:38]	<Koheleth>	I think sda1 and sda2 are both windows
[none]	[09:38]	<Maxdamantus>	MrWGW-, so you have /boot as a separate partition?
[none]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	I'm primarily ticked that Ubiquity just crashed without even giving me a warning
[none]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	no

[none]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	"""/"" is one partitoin, there isn't even a separate home"
[positive]	[09:39]	<tobmalf>	all the time :)
[none]	[09:39]	<Maxdamantus>	Then it doesn't. It'll be under /boot/initrd.img unless you specifically moved it to /
[none]	[09:39]	<bazhang>	Baughn: should be; unetbootin would be the one--what is your host os
[none]	[09:39]	<ikonia>	"MrWGW-: looks like your ""root"" is wrong then"
[none]	[09:39]	<teban>	should it be /dev/sda1 /media/sda1 defaults 0 1?
[none]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	GRUB is installed on a different partition, the root of a Fedora install
[none]	[09:39]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: can you verify the thumbdrive is working?
[none]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	my root is right (hd0,11), I know that because the kernel starts if I boot it
[none]	[09:39]	<Baughn>	bazhang: Host os? Debian, I guess
[none]	[09:39]	<MrWGW->	it just panics, complaining about not synching

[none]	[09:39]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: so thats the problem then
[none]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	ok, so what parameters does it require?
[none]	[09:40]	<Rafik>	Ziroday : you mean, test it on another computer ?
[none]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	what is the address of the initrd, if there is one?
[none]	[09:40]	<tobmalf>	yeah
[none]	[09:40]	<Ziroday>	Rafik: yep
[none]	[09:40]	<bazhang>	Baughn: if you /msg ubotu wubi you can read the ubuntuforums links on unetbootin
[none]	[09:40]	<iGraphiX>	Sajuukkhar, boot a live!cd version, backup your files and do a clean install. If you're trying to repair all those errors it will take more than a clean install, so why bother, just install. And make sure you chose a closer mirror for the updates in the future.
[none]	[09:40]	<MrWGW->	"initrd.img is ""not found"" by GRUB, even though I know it to be there..."
[none]	[09:40]	<ikonia>	MrWGW-: what partition is your ubuntu install on

[none]	[09:43]	<Baughn>	bazhang: ..unetbootin looks like it should work, I guess. Wubi, not so much.

[none]	[11:19]	<ikonia>	josh_: applications are split out across many directorys and mount points, for example apache web server, that is has the binaires (application) installed in /usr/bin, the config files are held in /etc, the log files are held in /var, to follow what you want, you'd have to have seperate partitions for /usr /var and /etc (you can't have a parttiion for /etC)

[positive]	[11:35]	<sCOTTo>	jrib: no - and i DIDNT put it there either! but the prob is that I Cant get root :)
[none]	[11:36]	<makkbe>	inditech: put the module in /etc/modules
[none]	[11:36]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You can make a folder on your partition that you backup... call it home... you can mount this as the linux default home directory... home is like Windows 'Documents and Settings'
[none]	[11:36]	<jrib>	sCOTTo: are you sure?  That's how it is in the pastebin

[none]	[11:37]	<icqnumber>	makkbe, wrong guess!
[none]	[11:37]	<josh_>	ifireball:  ok, so how much space can a linux partition require?  and is the package manager in my home directory, so that if my home directory is on the data partition it will be backed up?
[none]	[11:37]	<makkbe>	icqnumber: then i do not know
[none]	[11:37]	<jrib>	icqnumber: check that it burned correctly.  verify the integrity of the cd (one of the options at the beginning)

[none]	[11:38]	<icqnumber>	jrib, burned correctly, md5sum is okey!
[none]	[11:38]	<nonewmsgs>	how do mount an image?  mount command said it is a nonblock device.

[none]	[11:38]	<Zarin>	Hardy installer problem: I'm trying to install Hardy using the Live CD installer however when I get to the partition step the list contains nothing and all the buttons are disabled. Anyone know what it's trying to do?
[none]	[11:38]	<GNUtoo>	hardy of course...
[positive]	[11:38]	<jrib>	"sCOTTo: ok, there's no need for caps :)  just reboot, choose ""recovery mode"" from the grub menu and then use nano to edit /etc/hostname to remove the space and also edit /etc/hosts and add ""faithtop"" to the line with localhost"

[positive]	[11:39]	<ikonia>	nikitis: join #grub then if you need an expert
[none]	[11:39]	<panda>	nikitis : whats teh problem?
[none]	[11:39]	<icqnumber>	jrib, i got it from fu-berlin mirror? does it makes a difference?
[none]	[11:39]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Things like settings, for programs and such
[none]	[11:39]	<timo>	arvind_khadri: yes
[none]	[11:39]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Or do you mean the specific directories
[none]	[11:39]	<ifireball>	josh_: for a home machine I think a 5GB partition for the OS/Applications would suffice and you should place /home on your data partition and make it as big as possible (so you can have a lot of room for your data)
[none]	[11:39]	<timo>	arvind_khadri: i log on as normal use thou

[none]	[11:40]	<icqnumber>	jrib, u do not have a clue, right?
[none]	[11:40]	<ikonia>	"arvind_khadri: not ""sudo"""
[none]	[11:40]	<ifireball>	josh_: since your home directory also contains all your personal settings, backing it enough is enough to get back a fully working system after a reinstall and a restore
[none]	[11:40]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  so all my program data(preferences, documents(if i'm using a word eqivalent), etc) will automagically go into my home directory?
[none]	[11:41]	<arvind_khadri>	ikonia, ok sorry a BIG MISTAKE,what do you want me to do
[none]	[11:41]	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: think about what your saying to people
[none]	[11:41]	<ikonia>	arvind_khadri: as I keep asking you
[none]	[11:41]	<jrib>	icqnumber: nope, it's not suppose to do that.  Make sure you verified it using the option you are given when you boot the cd
[none]	[11:41]	<ifireball>	josh_: answering your question to Boredom_inc, yes.
[none]	[11:41]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Yeah and you would put downloads and music etc. in there also

[none]	[11:43]	<josh_>	ifireball and Boredom_inc:  ok thanks.  so, if i have a shitload of windows programs that's about 50GB, how much space do i need for the same shitload of linux programs(assuming all the programs have a linux and windows version)?
[none]	[11:43]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, directly after kernel is loaded
[none]	[11:43]	<Glas`Awyr>	Hey #Ubuntu. I'm installing right now and so am lurking.
[none]	[11:43]	<ikonia>	josh_: watch your langauge
[none]	[11:44]	<Diaco>	hi.
[none]	[11:44]	<Diaco>	has any body help me find a driver for dial-up modem on vaio fe laptops? i've tested scan modem tool and many other things without any result
[none]	[11:44]	<ikonia>	icqnumber: what do you mean ? do you get the gnome desktop
[none]	[11:44]	<josh_>	ikonia; huh?
[none]	[11:44]	<ikonia>	josh_: bad language is not called for
[none]	[11:44]	<Ubuntu2008>	stop swearing
[none]	[11:44]	<josh_>	sorry.
[none]	[11:44]	<ifireball>	josh_: I can't possibly think what 50GB of programs will be good for, windows programs are a mess
[none]	[11:44]	<joanjoseph>	good day every1
[none]	[11:45]	<nikitis>	i'm about to start swearing.  i've been up for 24 hours straight trying to figure out this grub issue
[none]	[11:45]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: If your used to backing up a partition all the time I recommend making a partition that is just your home directory... you then mount this folder in ubuntu and it is accessed a bit like a folder.... its at the location /home .... If you create a partition I can tell you how to make the partition mount at /home every time ubuntu boots up
[none]	[11:45]	<timo>	I have a back up should i restore. Seems the upgrade was not successful.
[none]	[11:45]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, after i select 'try ubuntu without any change to your computer', the first screen appear, is a log in screen!
[none]	[11:45]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i don;t actually have that much.  i just have no idea how much space linux programs take compared to windows.
[none]	[11:45]	<ikonia>	icqnumber: and thats the gnome login screen ?
[none]	[11:45]	<mrjack>	josh_: this depends absolutly on the program
[none]	[11:46]	<ifireball>	josh_: like I said, 5GB should be enough, as long as you make a separate /home partition
[none]	[11:46]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, i do not know how does it look like, i have no ubuntu installed
[none]	[11:46]	<dexter>	arf
[none]	[11:46]	<ikonia>	icqnumber: can you take a screen shot ?
[none]	[11:46]	<icqnumber>	ikonia, pink colours
[none]	[11:46]	<julz>	with two crap compies, can i increase performance with a two node cluster? or is it not really practical?
[positive]	[11:47]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  i kind of know how the directory structure; my school uses solaris.  i just have no experience as an admin
[none]	[11:47]	<dexter>	not a good idea the Firefox 3 in hardy
[none]	[11:47]	<panda>	josh_: generally much less space ...
[none]	[11:47]	<nikitis>	Getting GRUB error 17, Grub bootloader is on /dev/sda as well as my windows partition.  /dev/sdb is where menu.lst is located and my /boot and linux partitions.  Any ideas why?
[none]	[11:47]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You will probably find that you don't need as many programs on linux as windows. Linux programmers are quite adept at sharing libraries (in windows these are dll folders) so one program uses the features of many libraries. Pidgin is a good example (mind you it only uses a few libraries) but it works as a AIM, IRC, MSN, Yahoo (and more) client
[none]	[11:47]	<josh_>	panda:  thanks; that's what i was looking for.
[none]	[11:47]	<vistakiller>	slaytanic you run compiz?
[none]	[11:47]	<eckesicle>	josh_, I have a fresh install of ubuntu. with Office suite, and programming environment, browser email, the usual. That uses up approximately 4GB
[none]	[11:47]	<Boredom_inc>	dll files*
[none]	[11:48]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, menu.lst is /boot/grub/menu.lst
[none]	[11:48]	<josh_>	ecksicle:  would a power user need more?
[none]	[11:48]	<SoulChild>	Hey all, somehow the third mouse button (pressing first and second mb) does not work on my synaptics touchpad anymore,... any ideas ???
[none]	[11:48]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: yes it's on the 2nd drive sdb
[none]	[11:48]	<eckesicle>	josh_, I am a power user.
[none]	[11:48]	<nikitis>	but my grub boot loader is on sda which I think is supposed to point to sdb
[negative]	[11:48]	<Ubuntu2008>	anyone know how to recover from this error while upgrading to Hardy? http://pastebin.com/m77e504b2
[none]	[11:48]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, did you try re-installing the grub
[none]	[11:48]	<ifireball>	josh_: my current root partition (where the OS and all the programs are) currently has 2.2GB used and 3GB free after years of using the system, so 5GB should be enough
[none]	[11:49]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: i typed grub-install /dev/sda  It said it reinstalled but i still get the same error
[none]	[11:49]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: if I'm not mistaken, I saw something like that when I upgraded
[none]	[11:49]	<wild_oscar>	but it didn't stop the upgrade process
[none]	[11:49]	<ifireball>	josh_: and I am a power user, I've stuff such as Apache and MySql installed the most users wouldn't need
[positive]	[11:49]	<Stred>	Hello... Ubuntu newbie Q1: I'm running a Live CD on an XP system. Ubuntu is not recognizing my dual monitors (Nvidia FX5200), only one. Could there be an easy fix or would I have to install Ubuntu  first before trying to install new video drivers?   Thanks!
[none]	[11:49]	<josh_>	eckesicle:  sorry.  ok, so i really only need about 5GB of space.
[none]	[11:49]	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: my computer has been hanging on that message for half an hour
[positive]	[11:50]	<immesys>	stred: yeah, you would probably have to install
[none]	[11:50]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, you need to follow some steps before that
[none]	[11:50]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: such as?
[none]	[11:50]	<eckesicle>	josh_, I am a power user. Games will naturally take up more space
[none]	[11:50]	<samalex>	Dues Ubuntu 8.04 server have some firewall enabled that doesn't allow IP's beyond the local subnet connect?  I've estup Ubuntu 8.04 server with apache and SSH, and even though I can hit them from other computers on the local network, I'm unable to hit it from the Internet, even though that system is setup as DMZ in router and GRC.com's Shields Up does show ports 80 and 22 open.
[none]	[11:50]	<Stred>	thank you immesys
[none]	[11:50]	<samalex>	just curious ...
[none]	[11:50]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i feel like i should send microsfot my bill for the giant harddrvie i needed to buy
[none]	[11:50]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: if u know where the upgrade log is, I can check if the message was the same
[none]	[11:50]	<eckesicle>	josh_, sorry for repeat.
[none]	[11:50]	<SoulChild>	Third mouse button on tocupad, pressing first and second does not work anymore,... any ideas ???
[negative]	[11:50]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, loacating where it is...check out this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[positive]	[11:50]	<immesys>	stred: unless you remaster a live cd. This is not an easy task though
[positive]	[11:51]	<eckesicle>	then on the other hand i keep 500GB of media. So linux will not decompress that for you :)
[none]	[11:51]	<josh_>	ecksicle:  ok, is there a way to keeo linux separate from ubuntu so i can try installing other linux flavors?
[none]	[11:51]	<nikitis>	"arvind_khadri: I cannot do that.  When i type grub in the commandline after ""SU"" it comes back with a terminal error"
[positive]	[11:51]	<Stred>	immesys not likely to remaster a CD, thanks :)
[none]	[11:51]	<eckesicle>	so you might want to keep your harddrive
[none]	[11:51]	<eckesicle>	josh_ what do you mean?
[negative]	[11:51]	<timo>	can i have some guidance please http://pastebin.com/m3d047985
[none]	[11:51]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, its sudo
[none]	[11:51]	<ifireball>	josh_: maybe... but they're not the only one to blame, I find the windows programmers tend to be inefficient space-wise for various reasons (like not sharing components for example)
[none]	[11:52]	<eckesicle>	You can have different flavours on different partitions if you like, or virtualise.
[none]	[11:52]	<josh_>	ifireball:  </>joke</>
[none]	[11:52]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: found the log. it's the same message
[none]	[11:52]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: that's assuming I can get into a linux session correct?
[none]	[11:52]	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: d/w I fixed it. Seems like it's a known bug with gnome
[none]	[11:52]	<banshe>	how do i remove a file extension,say .url from all files in a directory?
[none]	[11:52]	<ifireball>	josh_: for your last question, that's just asking for trouble, and make little sense
[none]	[11:52]	<immesys>	timo: replacing with package maintainers version is usually okay
[none]	[11:52]	<wild_oscar>	Ubuntu2008: but my upgrade continued

[none]	[11:52]	<simion314>	anyone use no-script with firefox? i have a problem
[none]	[11:52]	<jrib>	banshe: one way is to use the 'rename' command (see its man page for examples)
[none]	[11:52]	<Jookia>	Hi guys
[none]	[11:52]	<Ubuntu2008>	wild_oscar: after quite a while it did
[none]	[11:52]	<josh_>	ifireball:  so what should i do if i want to have two separate linux distros?
[none]	[11:52]	<arvind_khadri>	banshe, use rename

CD/DVD burning software, bittorrent client, music player, office software, web browser, messenger client, PDF viewer, image manipulation software... The only software people really install (other than changing the default programs) is Programming environments and games... Games take up a huge amount of space obviously so you need to leave room on the ubuntu (not home) partition for games and c

[none]	[11:53]	<ifireball>	josh_: just install them on separate partitions, you can sometimes share the home partition, but it may not work all that well

[none]	[11:56]	<crashanddie>	josh_, other than that, most games that are OpenGL based are Linux compatible (UT comes to mind, Quake, etc) Wine allows you to run Windows based games, by wrapping the API it needs. It's been a long time ever since I used wine, but support wasn't that bad
[none]	[11:56]	<unocrash>	hey
[none]	[11:56]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I don't play games really but there are a surprisingly large amount of linux games. Not all that many AAA titles but there are a lot of native games that are very good. Otherwise you can just use Wine and run the games straight off your windows partition
[none]	[11:56]	<unocrash>	im just upgrading
[none]	[11:56]	<Jookia>	I have a problem; I'm running off my live CD, transfering my backups to a 1GB flash drive and I need to burn a CD. What should I do?
[none]	[11:57]	<_Rambaldi_>	i never really checked josh_ the package was about 240mb
[none]	[11:57]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, once you're booted, you should be able to eject the CD
[none]	[11:57]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  so would i need more than 5GB if i wanted to install a bunch of games?
[none]	[11:57]	<Xiliath>	anyone tried hildon on hardy?
[none]	[11:57]	<[^martin]>	Hi all, I've just got my Ubuntu install up and running and have connected succesfully to my wireless network. I am having trouble connecting to specific endpoints that other machines on the network are not. For example, www.mozilla.org works. www.google.com does not. How would I go about troubleshooting this?
[none]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	Martin
[negative]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	Goto about:config
[none]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	And find IPv6
[none]	[11:57]	<Jookia>	In the search bar
[none]	[11:58]	<immesys>	martin: try turning off ipv6
[none]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	And set that to true
[none]	[11:58]	<[^martin]>	ah
[negative]	[11:58]	<FloodBot2>	Jookia: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[none]	[11:58]	<crashanddie>	josh_, yeah, definitely
[none]	[11:58]	<[^martin]>	ok, 2 secs
[none]	[11:58]	<dreamcoder>	any reccomend what to install ubuntu or kubuntu?
[none]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Ubuntu is best
[none]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	But if you come from windows
[none]	[11:58]	<tiramisu>	dreamcoder: you can install kde on ubuntu
[none]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Get Kubuntu
[none]	[11:58]	<mosno>	Gnome Menu icons are blank for newly installed GTK+ applications (installed via aptitude on 8.04) -- anyone know what the issue is here?
[none]	[11:58]	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, depends on what you like most, if you prefer KDE or Gnome
[none]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Or if you come from Mac
[none]	[11:58]	<josh_>	crashanddie:  how much would you recommend?
[none]	[11:58]	<banshe>	it is dependent on ur taste
[none]	[11:58]	<Jookia>	Use Ubuntu
[none]	[11:58]	<_Rambaldi_>	what happened to ubuntu-bots
[none]	[11:58]	<immesys>	dreamcoder: kubuntu looks nicer but I'm having grief installing it, so use ubuntu rather
[none]	[11:58]	<amerio>	guys the wireless driver exists but wireless doesnt work please help
[none]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	Amerio
[none]	[11:59]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: I recommend allocating about 4 GB (ubuntu) + 5 GB (or less for games)... Because by the sounds of it you intend to play windows games and I assume they are already installed on your windows partition, you don't need to reinstall them on linux
[none]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	My friend had this problem
[none]	[11:59]	<tiramisu>	ubuntu should be used even if you want kde since kubuntu is dependency hell
[none]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	Disable IPv6
[none]	[11:59]	<banshe>	can someone tell me how to use rename? I am unable to understand the manpage
[none]	[11:59]	<lclimber>	hello everyone, i am havin a proble with my just upgraded ubuntu system, it doesn't seem to recognize my headphones
[negative]	[11:59]	<crashanddie>	josh_, I don't know, depends on the games you want to play... Take about 10Gig for WoW, 12Gig for a normal CS/HL2/CS:S install
[none]	[11:59]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Mind you not all of them will run
[none]	[11:59]	<amerio>	Jookia how to disable IPV6?
[none]	[11:59]	<dreamcoder>	ok will try ubuntu thanks
[none]	[11:59]	<osfameron>	tiramisu: I thought kubuntu was just ubuntu+kde_desktop ?
[none]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	I'm not sure how globaly.
[none]	[11:59]	<Jookia>	But there's a firefox config
[none]	[12:00]	<Xiliath>	osfameron, it basicly is, but some applications are different
[none]	[12:00]	<banshe>	lclimber, thats y u should not use upgrade.
[none]	[12:00]	<crashanddie>	tiramisu, please don't spawn ideas like that, thank you
[none]	[12:00]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  they aren't installed yet;  is there a way to install the games on a separate hard drive from ubuntu?
[none]	[12:00]	<Jookia>	Yes
[none]	[12:00]	<crashanddie>	josh_, of course, mount that drive to your filesystem, and install them there
[none]	[12:00]	<tehgeek>	Oh em gee.  The package servers seem uber-bogged down.  T_T
[none]	[12:00]	<Ubuntu2008>	amerio, do you know the make of your wi-fi card?
[none]	[12:00]	<ifireball>	crashanddie: shouldn't those games be installed to some other partition, say /usr/local or /opt ?
[none]	[12:00]	<Jookia>	Tehgeek: That's cause of 8.04 upgrades.
[none]	[12:00]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: What type of headphones? USB or standard headphone jack?
[none]	[12:00]	<crashanddie>	josh_, you might need to setup a new wine_C_drive, and set it to that given mount point
[none]	[12:01]	<tehgeek>	Jookia, Yeah, I figured.  Still is a bummer.  =X
[none]	[12:01]	<nikitis>	arvind_khadri: sorry, i'm trying it now
[none]	[12:01]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, Jookia, you can always blacklist kernel module ipv6 in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[none]	[12:01]	<ele_Acaro>	SALVE A TUTTI ------------------------------
[none]	[12:01]	<[^martin]>	"Jookia: disabled that IPV6 in Firefox, still no luck. It gets to ""Waiting for host..."" and just hangs there. Definitely a firefox issue though - just tried telnetting to the host"
[none]	[12:01]	<arvind_khadri>	nikitis, thats ok
[none]	[12:01]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc standard
[none]	[12:01]	<josh_>	crashanddie: no idea what that meant, but that's ok, i just wanted to know if it was possible.
[none]	[12:01]	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 Atheros AR242x
[none]	[12:01]	<ele_Acaro>	HI TO ALL -----------------------
[none]	[12:01]	<NekoKun>	Is there any ubuntu distro that is minimalist? Just kernel + basic commands, not including any GUI, just basic drivers? Like an 'apt-get' version... that anything extra than the most needed stuff must be downloaded...
[none]	[12:01]	<Jookia>	Where would I go about finding my firefox bookmarks file?
[none]	[12:01]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: So it's not using the correct sound card then
[none]	[12:01]	<obnibolongo>	lol hi ele_Acaro
[none]	[12:01]	<crashanddie>	josh_, if you're going to install wine based games, Wine is going to create a virtual Windows drive (filesystem), just save that virtual drive on the other hard disk, so you can use that space
[positive]	[12:02]	<obnibolongo>	NekoKun, Gentoo Linux? :P
[none]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: the server version is pretty basic
[none]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	if you want ubuntu
[none]	[12:02]	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 and its enabled and in Use
[none]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	otoh, debian netinstall is even more basic
[none]	[12:02]	<arvind_khadri>	NekoKun, that would be gobuntu
[none]	[12:02]	<NekoKun>	makkbe: How many gbs it needs to install?
[none]	[12:02]	<crashanddie>	NekoKun, you could also try Arch Linux
[none]	[12:02]	<jPratt>	I dont see any differences really in 8.04
[none]	[12:02]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: under 600 mb
[none]	[12:02]	<ele_Acaro>	I FORGOTTEN THAT HERE IT'S USED ONLY ENGLISH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[none]	[12:02]	<josh_>	crashanddie: ok, so does a swap file of 5GB(i have 4 gb ram) and a Ubuntu partition of 5GB sound reasonable?
[none]	[12:03]	<NekoKun>	Well, so far Debian EeeOS is the best option... mmm < 600mb
[none]	[12:03]	<crashanddie>	but yeah, I'd recommend the netinstall of Debian as makkbe said
[none]	[12:03]	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: stop with the caps
[none]	[12:03]	<ifireball>	josh_: why don't you go ahead and install? I think you'd have a fairly good grasp of the answers to all your questions within a month... and if you get it wrong the 1st time, just go ahead and reinstall, its fairly painless
[none]	[12:03]	<obnibolongo>	ele_Acaro, don't use caps, it's considered yelling
[none]	[12:03]	<neeto>	In 7.10, when I clicked on things in the system tray, it would switch to whatever workspace the corresponding window was on... it doesn't seem to do that anymore. How do I make it so that it does?
[none]	[12:03]	<ele_Acaro>	excuse me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[none]	[12:03]	<Boredom_inc>	"lclimber: Type ""cat /proc/asound/modules"" in terminal and check to see your soundcard (that the headphones are plugged in) is listed"
[none]	[12:03]	<NekoKun>	What's the main difference between debian and ubuntu?
[none]	[12:03]	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: and the exclamation marks as well, please
[none]	[12:03]	<crashanddie>	josh_, I'd say 5Gb is a bit minimalistic, to be honest, I'd shrink the swap to 2 gig, and give the 3 extra gig to your root
[none]	[12:03]	<ifireball>	josh_: at 4GB ram your should have about 4GB swap
[none]	[12:03]	<dagon_>	ele_Acaro; abuse of ! is also considered rude
[none]	[12:03]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: ubuntu is a customized debian
[none]	[12:04]	<neeto>	NekoKun: honestly? Sexiness.
[none]	[12:04]	<mademelaugh>	really
[none]	[12:04]	<makkbe>	one can say
[none]	[12:04]	<mademelaugh>	!swap
[negative]	[12:04]	<ubotu>	swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[none]	[12:04]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc it says 0 snd_hda_intel
[none]	[12:04]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc that's it
[none]	[12:04]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: debian generally use older packages in their stable versions
[none]	[12:04]	<josh_>	ifireball: about?
[negative]	[12:04]	<crashanddie>	mademelaugh, I wouldn't use 4gig swap on any desktop computer that has 4Gig of ram... He'll never use it :/
[none]	[12:04]	<NekoKun>	makkbe: So, in a way I could say that doing the correct patches/kernel I could get a debian install and turn it into a ubuntu?
[none]	[12:04]	<ele_Acaro>	am i bad for you ?
[none]	[12:05]	<amerio>	Ubuntu2008 ?
[none]	[12:05]	<neeto>	In 7.10, when I clicked on things in the system tray, it would switch to whatever workspace the corresponding window was on... it doesn't seem to do that anymore. How do I make it so that it does?
[positive]	[12:05]	<NekoKun>	Ok... I hate old things :p
[none]	[12:05]	<banshe>	how do i remove a file extension,say .url from all files in a directory?
[none]	[12:05]	<crashanddie>	NekoKun, you can always try Debian sid
[none]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: if you use one of the newer debian branches, yes
[none]	[12:05]	<mademelaugh>	crashanddie, yep, wise choice
[none]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	sid or lenny
[none]	[12:05]	<ifireball>	josh_: partition sizes, what installs where, games, etc.
[none]	[12:05]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: go to System -> Preferences -> Sound and press test for something other than capture... you should hear a beeping noise (you may have already tried this)
[none]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	lenny is probably recommended
[none]	[12:05]	<makkbe>	sid is really unstable from time to time
[none]	[12:05]	<mademelaugh>	what
[none]	[12:05]	<mademelaugh>	isn't here ubuntu
[none]	[12:06]	<Jookia>	How would I go about accessing my /home/jookia/.Trash folder ON ANOTHER HARDDRIVE
[none]	[12:06]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Let me know if you heard anything
[none]	[12:06]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, where did you mount it ?
[none]	[12:06]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i heard a swap file 1.15 times the size of your RAM was a good amount; is that too much?  if it's just virtual memory, does it ever need to be a bigger size than my RAM?
[none]	[12:06]	<Jookia>	disk-1
[none]	[12:06]	<ele_Acaro>	i would like learn more from you but i like much not be a problem for you !
[none]	[12:06]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, that's not a valid mount point
[none]	[12:06]	<amerio>	obnibolongo so disabling VP6 would make my wireless work?
[none]	[12:06]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, a mount point is something like /media/disk1, or /mnt/mydisk
[none]	[12:06]	<josh_>	ifireball:  this is installing on my laptop, btw
[none]	[12:06]	<ifireball>	NekoKun: you can say that about any Linux distro, doesn't make sense time-wise to do stuff that way though
[none]	[12:06]	<NekoKun>	I'm asking that cause I have an EeePC, and want something like eeeXUbuntu... but IMHO it has too much garbage installed....
[none]	[12:06]	<makkbe>	ele_Acaro: just ask whatever you want to know then
[positive]	[12:06]	<Kirby>	is ubuntu supposed to be slower than windowsxp ?
[none]	[12:07]	<mrjack>	if you boot ubuntu with low graphics, eg xdriver not installed correctly, ubuntu starts with 800x600 - in that resolution, the update-manager and many other programs are using more than 600px in height, but they cant be resized making it impossible for the user to klick the ok or next button...
[negative]	[12:07]	<arvind_khadri>	ikonia, i would like you to read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#head-ca3b215130839e9b2e1c85af31620153daba975c
[none]	[12:07]	<Jookia>	/media/disk-1
[none]	[12:07]	<makkbe>	NekoKun: do you want a gui?
[none]	[12:07]	<neeto>	Kirby: are you a troll or are you honest?
[positive]	[12:07]	<mademelaugh>	Kirby, not really, you cannot compare mem management with xp
[none]	[12:07]	<NekoKun>	makkbe: I plan to instal xfce later, but I don't want kde/gnome uneeded files around
[none]	[12:07]	<makkbe>	ok
[none]	[12:07]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: If you have lots of RAM your swap file will rarely be used but as a general rule a swap file roughly the size of your ram is good
[none]	[12:07]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc yes, i have sound, the proble is that it dosen't redirect the sound to my headphones when i plug them
[none]	[12:07]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, I don't know, I though you'd asked how to disable IPv6, I told you how, I didn't know what was leading to it, sorry
[positive]	[12:07]	<Kirby>	well my ubuntu is certainly slower than windowsxp
[none]	[12:07]	<mademelaugh>	Kirby, when refer to linux, it cannot be very fast, but it is stable, it just works
[none]	[12:07]	<Paavi2_0>	Kirby: yes and no. some things are much faster and some things you'd think to be slower
[none]	[12:07]	<crashanddie>	josh_, 4Gigs of RAM is quite an enormous amount, I doubt you'll ever need all of it. I seriously doubt you'll ever need more than 4Gig, your swap would probably never be used
[none]	[12:07]	<makkbe>	then i suggest a debian lenny or arch
[none]	[12:08]	<neeto>	NekoKun: I am coming into the middle of this conversation, but if you don't want gnome/kde, why not just use xubuntu?
[none]	[12:08]	<finek>	hi
[none]	[12:08]	<josh_>	Boredom_inc:  thanks
[none]	[12:08]	<crashanddie>	"josh_, you need swap ""to be safe"", but 2gigs of swap is by far enough with the enormous quantity of RAM you have access to"
[none]	[12:08]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> my wireless driver is enabled and in use but no wireless , do u have ny idea about that?
[none]	[12:08]	<ifireball>	josh_: the rule of thumb is that up to 2GB swap = ram*2; beyond 2GB its swap=ram; and beyond 4GB it doesn't mater... too much swap can cause trashing, though I doubt the swap will even get used on a 4GB desktop machine
[negative]	[12:08]	<arvind_khadri>	Boredom_inc, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#head-ca3b215130839e9b2e1c85af31620153daba975c
[positive]	[12:08]	<dagon_>	neeto; or fluxbuntu ;)
[none]	[12:08]	<tyranos>	hi everyone , what do i need to install to get  my fn keys to work on my laptop
[none]	[12:08]	<NekoKun>	neeto: I've installed it and found good sized KDE and gnome folders on it
[none]	[12:08]	<NekoKun>	also, it uses a LOT of space
[positive]	[12:08]	<case_>	Kirby, ubuntu can be seen as slower than winxp, as winxp si slower than dos... you have to compare the features too...
[none]	[12:08]	<josh_>	crashanddie:  what about when i hibernate/sleep?  (i'm on a laptop that i use for school)
[none]	[12:08]	<tehgeek>	tyranos, You need to hit the fn-lock key maybe?
[positive]	[12:08]	<tehgeek>	:P
[none]	[12:09]	<mademelaugh>	coz you know, harddisk 's speed cannot compare with memrory
[none]	[12:09]	<ruewan>	hi
[none]	[12:09]	<neeto>	NekoKun: well to run most apps you need some gtk/kde stuff, like any python programs or amarok, which is kde...
[none]	[12:09]	<finek>	what can i do when only one of speakers works and another one isnt?
[positive]	[12:09]	<Kirby>	I am talking about GUI, gui in ubuntu is slower than in windows xp- browsing files, opening jpgs, text...
[none]	[12:09]	<crashanddie>	josh_, swap isn't used at that point
[none]	[12:09]	<ruewan>	i just instaled hardy
[none]	[12:09]	<neeto>	dagon_: flux is icky
[none]	[12:09]	<Jookia>	 /media/disk-1/home/jookia/.Trash = permission denied.
[none]	[12:09]	<ruewan>	my hard drive has been going nonstop since i installed it
[none]	[12:09]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, well, which wireless card do you have?
[none]	[12:09]	<Kirby>	case_: what features???
[none]	[12:09]	<josh_>	ifireball: thanks.
[none]	[12:09]	<dagon_>	neeto; can't be worse than xfce
[none]	[12:09]	<finek>	Jookia, sudo
[none]	[12:09]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, because you mounted it and don't have write perms on the mount point
[none]	[12:09]	<Jookia>	how do I sudo thefile browser?
[none]	[12:09]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> Atheros AR242x
[none]	[12:09]	<neeto>	dagon_: that's where you're wrong good sir.
[none]	[12:09]	<NekoKun>	dagon_: Why 'worse than xfce'?
[none]	[12:10]	<dagon_>	Jookia; sudo nautilus
[none]	[12:10]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, ouch...
[none]	[12:10]	<Boredom_inc>	lclimber: Are your speakesr built-in or are they plugged into a different soundcard?
[none]	[12:10]	<josh_>	ifireball:  do you think a 2GB swap would be fine as well?
[none]	[12:10]	<dagon_>	NekoKun; never liked xfce
[none]	[12:10]	<case_>	Kirby, about gui features, 3d desktop, font antialiasing, file preview, vector icons... etc...
[positive]	[12:10]	<dagon_>	neeto; okey :p
[none]	[12:10]	<crashanddie>	Jookia, mount /media/disk-1 -o remount,rw,umask=0 or something like that, check the man page
[none]	[12:10]	<Kirby>	can I make ubuntu faster, disabling its so called features?
[none]	[12:10]	<tyranos>	thegeek , thx i ll try it
[none]	[12:10]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> not supported?
[none]	[12:10]	<finek>	what can i do when only one of speakers works and another one isnt?
[none]	[12:10]	<Jookia>	Kirby is a troll. I'm sure.

[none]	[12:10]	<james__>	Anyone else having audio problems? Mine sounds VERY grainy. This because of Pulse Audio?
[none]	[12:10]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc they are built in, its a laptop
[positive]	[12:10]	<NekoKun>	dagon_: I never liked gnome... can't explain why...
[none]	[12:10]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, don't know, I had problems with an atheros a while ago, checking which one was
[none]	[12:10]	<tyranos>	tehgeek, but the volume up key works
[none]	[12:10]	<ifireball>	josh_: depends on what you're gonna be running, but generally with 4GB ram, yeah.
[none]	[12:10]	<flithm>	"hey everyone, I just installed 8.04 here, and I don't get any 3d acceleration (nvidia) like I did with gutsy... anyone know what's going on?  The hardware drivers utility says it's detected ""nvidia_new"" but it's not in use"
[none]	[12:10]	<neeto>	xfce is not ugly in the least
[none]	[12:10]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: 2GB might even be a bit excessive but there is no harm in having one too big as long as you can spare the harddisk space
[none]	[12:11]	<case_>	Kirby, you sould try Xubuntu if you have an old hardware. less features, less needs.
[none]	[12:11]	<Glas`Awyr>	Trolls are usually looking for cybersex... ahem...
[none]	[12:11]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:i'd rather be safe than sorry.

[none]	[12:12]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, how many megabytes
[none]	[12:12]	<ifireball>	josh_: a heavily loaded server software like a database for example
[none]	[12:12]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, first of all, let me warn you, I told you that thing about IPv6 by mistake, I suppose I used the tab completion with the wrong nick ^^but anyway, I'll try to help you
[none]	[12:12]	<james__>	Is audio quality a known issue with Hardy?
[none]	[12:12]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; count 'em yourselves
[none]	[12:12]	<NekoKun>	neeto: xUbuntu used a lot of space... and once I can't easilly uninstall packages (as it's easy in windows), I preffer to get a single minimal install and aptget it application by application
[none]	[12:12]	<dagon_>	-s

[none]	[12:13]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> no problem buddy , Im listening
[none]	[12:13]	<Kirby>	maybe the default graphics driver in ubuntu is not good for my videocard?
[none]	[12:13]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, what? run free in terminal, mine is 256m
[negative]	[12:13]	<Boredom_inc>	﻿lclimber: Look around in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting ... I'm not really sure what the problem is if it's not switching to the headphones... I assume it works in Windows or whatever your previous OS was?
[none]	[12:13]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, wait a minute or so
[none]	[12:13]	<case_>	Kirby, what videocard do you have?
[none]	[12:13]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> take your time
[positive]	[12:13]	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd. Any ideas? I'm afriad my computer might explode if it tries to read the system from CD while burning a CD
[none]	[12:13]	<Tasmaniak>	Hi, since installing Hardy my disk usage (as in activity) is always around 60% and it's starting to worry me...is there likely something wrong?
[none]	[12:13]	<Kirby>	case_: an old one NVIDIA GeForce MX-200
[none]	[12:14]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; 14740
[none]	[12:14]	<flithm>	hey everyone, what's the ubuntu way of configuring xorg to use my nvidia driver?  Should I just edit the xorg.conf?
[positive]	[12:14]	<tehgeek>	tyranos, Oh, those buttons.  :P
[none]	[12:14]	<case_>	Kirby, you probably have to install the nvidia propretary driver to get decent video acceleration...
[none]	[12:14]	<latarsky>	would torrent be faster or a downloader like prozilla or flashget ?
[none]	[12:14]	<DracoZA>	flithm, tried nvidia-settings in a terminal ?
[none]	[12:14]	<lclimber>	Boredom_inc yes, it works on windows, thanx anyways
[none]	[12:14]	<Boredom_inc>	jookia: Lol why are you on the live CD and download the 8.04 CD?
[none]	[12:14]	<Jookia>	I have one CD drive. I'm on Live CD right now. I need to burn the 8.04 cd.
[none]	[12:14]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, 1.4g? ram? then gnome kde you can choose whatever you want
[none]	[12:14]	<Jookia>	boredom:
[none]	[12:14]	<Kirby>	case_: acceleration? do you mean d3d ogl stuff?
[none]	[12:15]	<ifireball>	btw, since games were mentioned, does anybody here knows of a nice fast FPS which isn't network-deathmatch-oriented?
[none]	[12:15]	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, desktop search? Check for Indexing service...
[none]	[12:15]	<Jookia>	It's a long story, upgrade from alt-cd mounted broke 7.10 on HDD, recovering data onto flash drive using Live CD, now up to this problem.
[none]	[12:15]	<josh_>	ifireball:  so if i'm at the partition preparations screen of my ubuntu install, in addition to my swap what do i need to create (other than my Ubuntu partition) and what do i mount where?
[positive]	[12:15]	<flithm>	DracoZA: it's not installed :)  so what's the deal, the last ubuntu version automatically detected my nvidia card and gave me compiz and stuff, but not 8.04?
[positive]	[12:15]	<Boredom_inc>	ifireball: do they even exist :P
[none]	[12:15]	<case_>	Kirby, opengl only on linux, but yes, that's what i mean. but it also benefits to 2d rendering
[positive]	[12:15]	<DracoZA>	flithm, I'm installing as we speak so I cant tell you yet :)
[none]	[12:15]	<Glas`Awyr>	Okay #Ubuntu, I am now running Linux on my laptop.
[none]	[12:15]	<ifireball>	Boredom_inc: they used to >_>
[none]	[12:16]	<Tasmaniak>	obnibolongo: I thought of that, but it says Tracker is idle.
[positive]	[12:16]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; say what? :P it's 14.7 meg
[none]	[12:16]	<tyranos>	so none knows how to get all the fn keys to work
[none]	[12:16]	<ifireball>	josh_: you need a /home partition
[none]	[12:16]	<tyranos>	maybe i need keytouchd
[none]	[12:16]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, what? i cannot believe that? try run less /proc/meminfo now
[none]	[12:16]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i will put that on my ntfs data partition, so it get backed up.
[none]	[12:16]	<bXi>	does anyone know the difference between vanilla firefox and ubuntu firefox?
[negative]	[12:16]	<Pord>	Can any1 help me with a problem im having with my xorg and graphics card.... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4789067#post4789067
[none]	[12:16]	<obnibolongo>	Tasmaniak, I've never found a good util to see what's accessing a disk, I usually nailed them (disk (ab)users) at using top... If you find a better app tell me!
[none]	[12:16]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: You said you would play windows games... make a separate partition and mount it as /windows (Here you can install games that are windows only) mind you save some space for linux games on the linux partition
[none]	[12:17]	<Kirby>	case_: I'll download it later at night. What else can I do to make Ubuntu faster (1. XFce 2. NV driver ...)
[none]	[12:17]	<Glas`Awyr>	"I have encountered my first ""problem"": A Restricted Drivers warning has appeared. It is telling me that my wireless network card driver is proprietary. Is this a real problem?"
[none]	[12:17]	<Boredom_inc>	"josh_: Actually you can mount it as anything.. ""/games"" might be more appropriate"
[none]	[12:17]	<NekoKun>	There's no Ubuntu version of netinst and business card installer?
[none]	[12:17]	<gluer>	Q: how do i change the default icons, such as folder icons?
[positive]	[12:17]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; what difference was it supposed to make? it's still 14.7 meg free, I'm running vmware at desktop 2, that explains it
[none]	[12:17]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  games will be on the computer i'm building this summer.  my laptop can't play games well.
[none]	[12:18]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, you had it working before how? ndiswrapper?
[none]	[12:18]	<ifireball>	josh_: not a very good idea I'm afraid, since NTFS isn't 100% compatible with Linux, you better make a separate ext3-formatted partition for /home and back it up with Linux tools
[none]	[12:18]	<amerio>	"gluer: u need to install a new icons , then copy them to "".icons"" folder in Home directory"
[positive]	[12:18]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, hmm, that expains it
[none]	[12:18]	<mediacenter>	Ciao a tutti
[none]	[12:18]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> I had it working without ndiswrapper
[none]	[12:18]	<case_>	Kirby, try nvdriver first. and don't download it form the nvidia website. you should find dozen of tutorial on how to set it up on the ubuntu forum...
[none]	[12:18]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, which driver?
[none]	[12:18]	<kernando>	Helllo is there a way to enable a wireless connection and a lan connection at the same time in ubuntu?
[none]	[12:18]	<mediacenter>	c'è qualcuno che può aiutarmi con una scheda Pinnacle?
[positive]	[12:18]	<dagon_>	mademelaugh; sorry if I confused you :)
[none]	[12:18]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, out-of-the-box?
[none]	[12:19]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Ahh ok... So this computer you're using now already has windows. Yeah it's probably best to create a separate /home partition like ifireball said.
[none]	[12:19]	<wild_oscar>	gluer: System > Preferences > Theme > Customize > Icons.
[none]	[12:19]	<Kirby>	case_: not from website???
[none]	[12:19]	<mademelaugh>	dagon_, indeed
[none]	[12:19]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> the same one but I really have no idea how it worked before
[none]	[12:19]	<josh_>	ifireball:  i thought linux could read and write ntfs.  what problems does it have?  how big can home partitions get?
[none]	[12:19]	<case_>	Kirby, all these stuff are in the ubuntu repositories, so you don't need to trust a third party website
[none]	[12:19]	<case_>	Kirby, how many RAM do you have in this PC ?
[none]	[12:19]	<ifireball>	josh_: the security scheme for example is completely different
[none]	[12:20]	<JPSmon>	can someone help me with some module drivers?
[positive]	[12:20]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  my data partition has no os on it.  xp and vista have their own partitions, and my data has its own partition as well.
[none]	[12:20]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: It can read and writes NTFS... I use it all the time because my brother keeps the music on the windows partition. I've never encountered troubles but technically linux isn't 100% NTFS compatible.
[none]	[12:20]	<Kirby>	case_: 768MB, so how do I install a better driver then?
[none]	[12:20]	<JPSmon>	like how to install and uninstall them?
[none]	[12:20]	<sn0rlax>	hi... I just installed server 8.04 i386. and mysqld_safe is using 100% cpu. funny thing is, there are no databases in mysql yet...
[none]	[12:20]	<inspired>	anyone gotten flash working on Hardy AMD64?
[none]	[12:20]	<ifireball>	josh_: Linux uses the UNIX 12bit permission scheme while NTFS uses complex ACLs
[none]	[12:20]	<kernando>	does anyone knonw how to? i want to connect to my other computer while still connected to the internet??
[none]	[12:20]	<Boredom_inc>	oh yeah and the security is different. Linux can delete whatever it feels like from NTFS
[none]	[12:20]	<gluer>	wild_oscar: i dont have themes in my menu, just appearance
[negative]	[12:20]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, well... use forums or google for it, it's the best I can say you... Use http://www.savagehamsters.com/?p=55 for a quickstart
[none]	[12:20]	<josh_>	boredom_inc: would you recommend putting my home directory on a data only ntfs partition?
[none]	[12:21]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> how about madwifi do u think its gonna work?
[none]	[12:21]	<josh_>	ifireball:  would it be ok if i don't plan to encrypt anything?
[none]	[12:21]	<ifireball>	josh_: no
[none]	[12:21]	<MarV->	hi
[none]	[12:21]	<Boredom_inc>	josh_: Probably not. I'd recommend it's own ext3 partition.
[none]	[12:21]	<Tasmaniak>	obnibolongo: I had a look with top as suggested, and I think it may have been the mythtv-backend, I killed the process and it seemed to quieten down a bit. Thanks.
[none]	[12:21]	<Glas`Awyr>	Question #3: I understand there is an incredibly easy way to install software (sudo something...) where can I find out more about that?
[none]	[12:21]	<sn0rlax>	anyone else having problems w/ mysqld_safe maxing out cpu? ( no databases loaded even )
[none]	[12:21]	<josh_>	ifireball: how big can a home directory get?
[positive]	[12:21]	<ifireball>	josh_: the different permission scheme may cause all kinds of unexpected problems for various programs
[none]	[12:21]	<MarV->	can someone name me the tool witch installs newest nvidia driver automaticly?
[none]	[12:22]	<tyranos>	envy
[none]	[12:22]	<Villarroel>	Hi.
[none]	[12:22]	<MarV->	ahh right thanks
[positive]	[12:22]	<Boredom_inc>	﻿josh_: In fact if you want you could mount the ext3 home directory in windows. I do this also... mind you windows has even less support for ext3 than linux has for NTFS. I did it mostly cause it looks cool :P
[positive]	[12:22]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, can't tell you without having messed with that Atheros in particular more... Which I haven't :) (a firend of mine had that wireless card and I gave up trying to make it work on 7.10 :P)
[none]	[12:22]	<tyranos>	MarV-, the tool is named envy
[none]	[12:22]	<ifireball>	josh_: depends on what you put in it, this is where all your documents/files/music/video/settings goes to by default
[none]	[12:22]	<wild_oscar>	gluer: then I don't know
[positive]	[12:22]	<obnibolongo>	amerio: Google, Forums, and you'll find something. The page I told you had windows drivers which worked well with ndiswrapper :)
[positive]	[12:22]	<amerio>	<obnibolongo> I'll try to mess things up now ! if I make it work I'll let you know how ;)
[positive]	[12:22]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, good luck :)

[none]	[12:23]	<Boredom_inc>	﻿Glas`Awyr: You mean 'sudo apt-get install <packagename>'?
[positive]	[12:23]	<obnibolongo>	amerio, :)
[none]	[12:23]	<josh_>	boredom_inc:  could i mount my ext3 directory in my ntfs data partition?  i don't care if windows can't read it.
[none]	[12:23]	<case_>	Kirby, you only need to install packages from the package manager (synaptic) .  you can try to install the package nvidia-settings, it should eventualy set it up to you, but i'm not 100% positive on that point...
[none]	[12:23]	<wild_oscar>	"btw, can anyone check if ""help"" works on appearence?"
[none]	[12:23]	<MarV->	are there any problems with envy in 8.04?
[none]	[12:24]	<mademelaugh>	!ext3 | josh_

[none]	[12:42]	<chazco>	Anyone know why the Hardy live CD is in such a low resolution? Gusty used to give 1024x768... this seems to be 640x480
[none]	[12:42]	<crashanddie>	JPSmon, dunno then
[none]	[12:42]	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: total freezes are typically roted in hardware problems though, could your system be overheating?
[none]	[12:42]	<damo22>	how can i install xmms in hardy?
[none]	[12:42]	<JPSmon>	chazco: whats your graphics card?
[none]	[12:43]	<crashanddie>	kebab, that's the right answer
[positive]	[12:43]	<iKar>	guitarj1d: I have x1950 pro and I had boot problems did U?
[none]	[12:43]	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: but the system doesnt freeze unless i use the wobble windows effect,,
[none]	[12:43]	<crashanddie>	kebab, defaults usually work
[none]	[12:43]	<kebab>	crashanddie: It'd not the right answer
[none]	[12:43]	<chazco>	JPSmon - Its an onboard nvidia card... gives 1024x768 on gusty cd, 1440x900 on gusty with drivers... 640x480 on Hardy...
[none]	[12:43]	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: does the system work right without effects? say, using the restricted driver and playing a 3D game?
[none]	[12:43]	<kebab>	banshe: where do I get linux-sources?
[none]	[12:43]	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: the wobble is one of the more demanding effects afaik
[none]	[12:44]	<nullkuhl>	a 3d game ? have none currently
[none]	[12:44]	<guitarj1d>	iKar, no problem with boot, but I can't adjust screen resolution and the shut down screen colors are all messed up
[positive]	[12:44]	<chazco>	JPSmon - Hopefully the drivers will be available when installed, but making install tricky :)
[none]	[12:44]	<banshe>	kebab, synaptic
[none]	[12:44]	<nullkuhl>	ifireball: works fine without effects !
[none]	[12:44]	<JPSmon>	chazco : and annoying yeah

[none]	[12:51]	<ifireball>	nullkuhl: sounds like a bug... or a faulty GFX card
[none]	[12:51]	<usernamed>	I'm guessing Realtek do more than one chipset, how do I narrow down what I've got?
[none]	[12:51]	<nullkuhl>	hmmm
[none]	[12:51]	<HardyOne>	JPSmon: perhaps geeksquad is in your area ?

[none]	[12:53]	<NekoKun>	Can I add drivers to hardy's mini.iso?
[none]	[12:53]	<marvxxx>	just upgraded to hardy and my flash plugin in firefox doesnt have sound no more..any ideas?
[none]	[12:53]	<iKernel>	usernamed ah, is it the belkin wireless usb?
[none]	[12:53]	<Nuc134rB0t>	usernamed, type lspci
[none]	[12:53]	<usernamed>	iKernel, It certainly is
[none]	[12:53]	<Pord>	any1 else having driver issues with ati graphics cards?
[none]	[12:53]	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: Does everything else have sound? eg. Totem etc.?
[none]	[12:53]	<HardyOne>	JPSmon: hehe is that so? I just remember seeing the cars on the road thinking I need to get a job with those guys
[none]	[12:53]	<harveyd>	how do you enable modules in apache installed in ubuntu?
[none]	[12:53]	<iKernel>	usernamed I doubt you'll have much luck with usb wireless, I'd recccommend buying a dlink card with an atheros chipset
[none]	[12:54]	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: yep...but i found a thread at forums
[none]	[12:54]	<harveyd>	i remember it had a funny command line helped, but cant find / remember the name
[none]	[12:54]	<LainIwakura>	mademelaugh: i'm not booted in ubuntu now.. will ifconfig, iwconfig, lshw -C network, lspci, or lsmod suffice (those of which I have written down)
[none]	[12:54]	<ere4si>	NekoKun: the mini iso is the net install  - most apps are d/loaded
[positive]	[12:54]	<HardyOne>	harveyd: restart apache after you add the modules to your .conf
[none]	[12:54]	<iKernel>	usernamed anything with an atheros chipset will do actually, best to get one that goes into PCI port
[none]	[12:54]	<xhamahx>	hello, i am using a dell m1330 laptop, when i installed ubuntu, i hav trouble using the internal mic, can anyone help me
[none]	[12:54]	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: lol ok
[none]	[12:54]	<NekoKun>	ere4si: But I need some basic drivers... even to the wireless...
[positive]	[12:54]	<usernamed>	the case is such that the graphics card coolling hangs over the one remaining pci slot, no pci expansion possible :(
[none]	[12:54]	<snask>	xhamahx, what soundcard do you got?
[none]	[12:54]	<iKernel>	usernamed and I know the nature of new linux users, they will fight trying to make their current hardware work instead of buying something else. but the better option is to go out and buy something else
[none]	[12:54]	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: i will check
[none]	[12:54]	<plagerism>	Is there anyway to automatically set the execute bit on oridinary files ala umask or any other means?
[positive]	[12:55]	<crashanddie>	"xhamahx, could be please explain more ""having troubles"" isn't an error message"
[none]	[12:55]	<marvxxx>	Boredom_inc: works
[none]	[12:55]	<ifireball>	harveyd, HardyOne: if its apache2 there is a command a2-something (use tab...)
[none]	[12:55]	<ere4si>	NekoKun: then the mini iso won't be appropriate for you afaik
[none]	[12:55]	<iKar>	oki I downloaded drivers and Im waiting thx 4 command
[none]	[12:55]	<crashanddie>	plagerism, chmod +x file
[none]	[12:55]	<usernamed>	iKernel, is there no USB solution possible?
[none]	[12:55]	<Glas`Awyr>	I'm going to have one more poke at this. If I can't get xChat running on my machine there is no hope for me.
[negative]	[12:55]	<ToM-X>	Hey, Can someone take a look at this for me. I want to know if my WIFI now works without Ndiswrapper http://i29.tinypic.com/14b6jqe.png
[none]	[12:55]	<HardyOne>	ifireball: no idea. just know that apache needs to be rehashed/restarted anytime you add something to it
[none]	[12:55]	<Ravenkin>	Can you use a KDE application on a Gnome system?
[none]	[12:55]	<harveyd>	a2enmod
[none]	[12:55]	<xhamahx>	i mean, ubuntu itself dont detect the mic,
[none]	[12:55]	<harveyd>	thats it, thanks
[none]	[12:55]	<plagerism>	crashanddie: ala umask, as in automatically upon creation
[positive]	[12:56]	<ifireball>	harveyd: a2enmod
[none]	[12:56]	<crashanddie>	plagerism, no, why would you need it ?
[none]	[12:56]	<iKernel>	usernamed probably, but the belkin usb is very crap anyway, and drops out frequently. I had to install the drivers on windows frequently whenever it stopped working
[none]	[12:56]	<Boredom_inc>	marvxxx: This is the standard flash plugin yes? As in adobes?
[none]	[12:56]	<iKernel>	usernamed, so even if you can  get it working, it will probably not be worth it
[none]	[12:56]	<ere4si>	Ravenkin: you can but alot of extras will be d/loaded to make it work
[none]	[12:56]	<beniamino>	how do i control what meta-release file is used? every time i run update-manager on hardy, i get 'current dist not found in meta-release file'
[none]	[12:56]	<Ravenkin>	ere4si thanks
[none]	[12:56]	<Boredom_inc>	Does anyone know which mixed flash plugin uses by default... eg. ALSA
[none]	[12:56]	<ere4si>	k
[none]	[12:56]	<ToM-X>	Anyone lol?
[none]	[12:57]	<crashanddie>	plagerism, only the program that creates the file can set given bits on it, the samba server allows you to set execute bits, but you need to go through it
[none]	[12:57]	<ifireball>	HardyOne: yeah, but you don't need to actually tweak the conf file since the apache2 config is modular, you have symlink directories a-la /etc/rc*.d
[none]	[12:57]	<Batch>	#ubuntu - I installed the correct drivers using ndisgtk, It said there WAS hardware for it so i don't see why the light should stay orange. I also modprobed.
[none]	[12:57]	<iKernel>	ToM-X what?
[none]	[12:57]	<Glas`Awyr>	"I am in the Add/Remove Applications window. I can see xChat. I click it, and it tells me ""The list of applications is not available"""

I wasnt thinking straight, i assumed at first you had used something horrible like windozeIE do download it, wget is very good, i think it will just work, starting at the offset fro

[none]	[13:53]	<BrianB04>	Morning all: I have an oddball issue with Ubuntu. This morning I went to play a Quicktime movie. It popped up, asked if I wanted to find the right codec, it found two and I installed the FFMPEG codecs. Now, whenever I go to open another quicktime movie, it again pops up the request to search for a codec because 'The codec to play this movie is not installed'. Anyway to stop that.

[positive]	[13:56]	<mheath>	erik__: um, yeah...what everyone else is saying is true. oss is very similar to ALSA, but inferior, and has been obsolete (due to ALSA) for about 6 years. Don't use that. :-)
[none]	[13:56]	<erik__>	do i need to restart anything to make vlc use alsa?

[none]	[13:57]	<mheath>	erik__: Your system doesn't even really support oss anymore, anyway...all that would be doing is ALSA simulating the old oss.
[none]	[13:57]	<iKernel>	amerio, modprobe -r <module you want to boot up the ass and get out for just a moment while you do something else>
[none]	[13:57]	<intrinsyx>	N1NCHN41L5: then reinstall ubuntu's grub. fire up the livecd, open up terminal, run sudo grub, and from the grub prompt, find /boot/grub/stage1, it'll return the device it found it on, root <device>, setup <device>
[none]	[13:57]	<slytherin>	erik__: restart vlc perhaps
[none]	[13:57]	<arvind_khadri>	artti, use somewhere around 4x or so to be safe

[none]	[13:59]	<Fome>	intrinsyx: sorry, for being stupid, but there is no obvious place to set the default card. (after I click the thing there is a list of different options)
[none]	[13:59]	<amerio>	Net_Demon anything new?
[none]	[13:59]	<dooglus>	iKernel: how?
[positive]	[13:59]	<dagon_>	artti; tip: use tab :) it's dagon_, burn on TDK or Fujifilm, works perfect
[none]	[13:59]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, ctrl+alt+del
[none]	[14:00]	<erik__>	slytherin: i thought it was grabbing the default one from gnome

[none]	[14:00]	<Fome>	intrinsyx: but then I don't know how to continue
[none]	[14:00]	<mattycoze>	oh thnk christ i fixed that
[none]	[14:00]	<intrinsyx>	Fome: select Volume Control, Output devices tab, look for a little sheild
[none]	[14:01]	<slytherin>	sailaway85: for video converting you will have to log a bug against the package you are using. But I haven't seen the one where FF crashes when 3d is unabled
[none]	[14:01]	<iKernel>	dooglus, you'll need a mouse in order to set the keyboard short cut, btw
[none]	[14:01]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, try using tab in that box not sure whether it'll work or not
[none]	[14:01]	<intrinsyx>	"Right click, ""Default"""

[none]	[14:01]	<iKernel>	dooglus, then use it and set a keyboard short cut

[none]	[14:01]	<arvind_khadri>	dooglus, what exactly is your problem

[none]	[14:02]	<intrinsyx>	Fome: or if you want output from both cards, click the plug, configure local sound server, simultaneous output tab, checkmark the box.
[none]	[14:02]	<NeT_DeMoN>	amerio: no but im giving up
[none]	[14:02]	<slytherin>	dooglus: you can simple use Alt + L to activate the logout button
[none]	[14:02]	<dooglus>	arvind_khadri: I want to log out.  the dialog that appears when I try to log out is in the middle of the screen.  the middle of the screen is all dead pixels, so I can't see it, and I can't move it elsewhere.  I think I need to use the keyboard
[negative]	[14:02]	<NeT_DeMoN>	i will just stick to hardwire or vista :(
[none]	[14:02]	<moDumassest>	!audio
[negative]	[14:02]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[none]	[14:10]	<moDumassest>	daft punk sounds really scratchy, i cant seem to fix this, has anyone had sound issues thus far?
[positive]	[14:10]	<jerzyk86>	thx :)
[none]	[14:10]	<pallavi>	I am new to ubuntu
[positive]	[14:10]	<ToM-X1>	Right, I'm back with my crappy WIFI problem :P
[positive]	[14:10]	<dagon_>	v0lksman; that's good, really. But I've had bad experience with lowprice cd's, no matter what burner I've used
[none]	[14:10]	<bazhang>	moDumassest: what is that
[none]	[14:10]	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: actually, it's called gmountiso
[positive]	[14:10]	<albech>	v0lksman: i have had experiences with disks too, where it helped to slow down the burn speed
[none]	[14:10]	<pallavi>	can u please tell me how to login as a root user
[none]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, do you have a support question
[none]	[14:10]	<moDumassest>	music is really scratchy
[none]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	pallavi, why do you want to do that
[none]	[14:10]	<cgentry72>	i'm removing anything that has to do with firefox and then reinstalling flash
[none]	[14:10]	<moDumassest>	using alsa, have googled it no one knows
[none]	[14:10]	<arvind_khadri>	!root
[negative]	[14:10]	<ubotu>	Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[none]	[14:10]	<bhsx>	jerzyk86: 'sudo apt-get install gmountiso'
[none]	[14:10]	<slytherin>	!tell pallavi about sudo
[none]	[14:10]	<N1NCHN41L5>	pallavi SUDO
[none]	[14:10]	<sailaway85>	slytherin: Actually I'm not sure... I think it came from firefox?
[none]	[14:10]	<IntangibleLiquid>	if a wifi network appears in the nm-applet, does it mean that my wifi work? My wifi LED lights up during boot time then dims, is this a problem?
[none]	[14:11]	<arvind_khadri>	!sudo | pallavi
[negative]	[14:11]	<ubotu>	"pallavi: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges (""root""). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information."
[none]	[14:11]	<nickthorley>	net_demon: i used to use fedora but when got a laptop it wouldnt work with wireless and thus tried ubuntu which worked first time so was really happy but then new version of ubuntu comes out and no support  - great
[none]	[14:11]	<albech>	v0lksman: cant say anything about disks since they are mostly produced on the same factories, just added different logos
[none]	[14:11]	<pallavi>	because when i am trying to copy folders it is saying operation not permitted
[none]	[14:11]	<v0lksman>	albech:  I'm not saying you WON'T have issues...but since we don't know what make/model artti has it seems silly to jump the gun and tell him to slow it down and buy new CDs
[none]	[14:11]	<moDumassest>	!alsa
[negative]	[14:11]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[none]	[14:11]	<ToM_x>	Ah, iKernel has gone -_-
[positive]	[14:11]	<bhsx>	IntangibleLiquid: yes, it should be working if there's a wireless network in nm-applet
[none]	[14:11]	<cgentry72>	no luck with that

[none]	[14:12]	<v0lksman>	dagon_ albech:  All I'm saying is the best way to know is to try burning at full speed on the disks you have...If that doesn't work then try slowing it down...if that fails then maybe look at new media...
[none]	[14:12]	<ha|0>	hello, I'm having trouble writing to a particular partition, but with only one program.  I have to run it as root for it to work.  Any thoughts?

[none]	[14:12]	<IntangibleLiquid>	<bhsx> <crashanddie>: thanks, I just cannot test it because the wifi is encrypted, but I did attempt to connect to a free wifi this afternoon without success. How can I activate the LED? My function key does not work for wifi

[none]	[14:13]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  what package did you end up removing?
[none]	[14:13]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: depends on what you are trying to do, /etc/init.d/ssh restarts the server...
[none]	[14:13]	<T4NK3R>	lol
[none]	[14:13]	<Heroin>	Ruben?
[positive]	[14:13]	<T4NK3R>	ben er eindelijk:)
[none]	[14:13]	<slytherin>	pallavi: it depends on what you are trying to access. Not everything in root folder has read access to everyone

[none]	[14:13]	<T4NK3R>	hi
[positive]	[14:13]	<albech>	v0lksman: but slowing down the burn is not a bad suggestion, and it definitely wont cause more failures ;)
[positive]	[14:13]	<ari_stress>	hi guys, just installed hardy. but i cannot install build-essential, has anyone experience the same?
[none]	[14:13]	<artti>	I hope that Ubuntu 8.04(32-bit) works fine on AMD64.
[none]	[14:13]	<crashanddie>	IntangibleLiquid, check your syslog to see if you have any changes when using the function key
[none]	[14:13]	<pallavi>	sorry i made a mistake

[none]	[14:14]	<LainIwakura>	"ifireball: Well, I added ""ServerAliveInterval 120"" to ssh_config, so I thought I needed to restart it so the changes will go into effect. But there is no ssh restart..."

[none]	[14:15]	<slytherin>	bhsx: No, I am trying to debug the problem another user is facing.
[none]	[14:15]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: like the name implies, ServerAliveInterval is a server configuration directive, you should be placing it on the server...
[none]	[14:15]	<v0lksman>	erik__:  did you try re-installing policykit and policykit-gnome?

[none]	[14:18]	<ifireball>	LainIwakura: however, I think its a better practive to make client-side changes in your own home directory e.g. in the ~/.ssh/config file
[none]	[14:18]	<Al00>	Anyone else having this issue?

[none]	[14:22]	<Itaku>	uh ive seen this in my terminal for the past 5 mins. 0% [Connecting to us.archive.ubuntu.com (91.189.88.31)]
[none]	[14:22]	<f0rmat>	can someone tell me how to set the system so every time i add a user by default they can only access ~
[positive]	[14:22]	<ndy>	bazhang: burned the ubuntu cd two times .. will try another one :)
[none]	[14:22]	<slytherin>	bhsx: no, you are certainly using something other than icedtea. Check 'java -version'
[none]	[14:22]	<bhsx>	Itaku: it's because the servers are getting SLAMMED
[none]	[14:22]	<sailaway85>	slytherin: removed divx plugin ... running tovin now without system rebooting
[none]	[14:22]	<bhsx>	just let it run
[none]	[14:22]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley : What type of wireless card do you have? Belkin, D-Link etc
[none]	[14:22]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  with envy or just when you install manually?
[none]	[14:22]	<slytherin>	Heroin: what with that?
[none]	[14:23]	<Itaku>	well crap
[none]	[14:23]	<Heroin>	slytherin: the encryption option in gnome.. in the filemanager
[none]	[14:23]	<Itaku>	ill try to find another place to download phpmyadmin
[none]	[14:23]	<pallavi>	i tried it is copied
[none]	[14:23]	<nickthorley>	voxxi: i have an intel 3945 abg card
[none]	[14:23]	<pallavi>	but i am not able to view the contents in it
[none]	[14:23]	<loder>	can I ask are many people trying the lazy way of upgrading to Heron or are you all being sensible and backing up and starting fresh. i always used to do a fresh install as awindows user, but I'm told aptitude especially does avery good job?
[none]	[14:23]	<gord_>	 nickthorley : ah ok got u now, yep use the live CD to install a system, THEN solve the wireless probem, do u have a a wireD network connection on the machine?
[none]	[14:23]	<slytherin>	Heroin: ever heard of gnupg?
[none]	[14:23]	<bazhang>	nickthorley that card not working?
[none]	[14:23]	<modoc>	once again ubuntu has given my hard drives names I can't find.
[none]	[14:23]	<modoc>	How can I list the known drives on the machine?
[none]	[14:24]	<len>	after updating to 8.04 my gnome-rdp gives this error: Error during the connection to database, uninstalling and installing the package dit not help
[none]	[14:24]	<arthur>	@ loder yeah no need to starting fresh ... I have done both ways several times and had no problems
[none]	[14:24]	<ifireball>	modoc: sudo fdisk -l
[none]	[14:24]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, before the update i had envy and now i want to install it the ubuntu way so it doesn't break during the kernel updates
[none]	[14:24]	<v0lksman>	!uuid > modoc
[none]	[14:24]	<bazhang>	loder well not really lazy; just like to continue on--your way is fine too though
[none]	[14:24]	<bhsx>	i installed icedtea-gcjwebplugin, which installed openjdk --jre
[none]	[14:24]	<immesys>	!uuid > me
[none]	[14:24]	<bhsx>	openjdk-6-jre, that is
[none]	[14:24]	<nickthorley>	gord_: yes I do.  how can i install patches and test though when the patches may need a reboot?
[none]	[14:24]	<bullium>	modoc: sudo fdisk -l
[none]	[14:24]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: no it doesnt
[none]	[14:24]	<bullium>	ifireball: sorry
[none]	[14:24]	<modoc>	ifireball, bullium, v0lksman: thanks!
[none]	[14:24]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  ahh...I think Alberto fixed that with EnvyNG...
[none]	[14:25]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: what does ifconfig show
[none]	[14:25]	<bullium>	modoc: yep
[none]	[14:25]	<jojomas>	so, funny thing happened partition editor doesn't detect my partitions, but i can see them from nautilus. je, I can't get past the LiveCD
[none]	[14:25]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley : Apparently, according to the linux wireless list, its fully supported. What have you tried to get it working
[none]	[14:25]	<N1NCHN41L5>	"Anyone Know How to DUAL BOOT Multiple Linux OS""S??????"
[none]	[14:25]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: unfortunately cant tell you as not with the machine at the moment
[none]	[14:25]	<slytherin>	bhsx: yes, that is different from icedtea-java-7 packages. But even openjdk is not complete AFAIK,
[none]	[14:25]	<sanozuke>	whooo
[none]	[14:25]	<loder>	bazhang i am thinking of doing that actually - Gutsy does everytihng I need and I actually rely on it as my main system now so I loathe to mess with awinning formula
[positive]	[14:25]	<arstanj>	hi all, is the ubuntu repos lagging? does anybody experiencing this?
[none]	[14:25]	<slytherin>	N1NCHN41L5: grub installation wil take care of it
[positive]	[14:25]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  may want to check with him in the forums though....Envy has been flawless for me with ATI in the past and so far with NG and nVidia it's been ok...but no kernel updates yet... ;)
[none]	[14:25]	<mattycoze>	hey how do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[none]	[14:25]	<nickthorley>	voxxi: i havent tried anything - it was autodetected before and I cant see why the driver should have been removed from a later version of the os - seems like a backward step to me
[none]	[14:25]	<pallavi>	Hi
[none]	[14:26]	<artenius>	N1NCHN41L5: grub
[none]	[14:26]	<immesys>	arstanj: all ubuntu sites are lagging
[none]	[14:26]	<afallenhope>	anyone know how I can completely restore Ubuntu? I don't know the partitions.. I just did the desktop installation. I want to reinstall. I jacked up all my modules some how.
[none]	[14:26]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I have the exact same card and it works very well once you get it going--when you have a chance perhpas you can troubleshhot it
[none]	[14:26]	<gord_>	 nickthorley : ah, i meant actually INTALL the system onto hard disk using the live CD, but do u just want to test it witout disturbing the hard disk? not easy at all that way....
[none]	[14:26]	<Sajuukkhar>	same here
[none]	[14:26]	<JPSmon>	what would happen if I ran wubi with wine???
[none]	[14:26]	<N1NCHN41L5>	artenius - GRUB is my only problem
[none]	[14:26]	<Sajuukkhar>	i want to know what partitions i require to have
[none]	[14:26]	<slytherin>	N1NCHN41L5: and please don't use all caps. It is considered as shouting.
[none]	[14:26]	<arstanj>	immeys: thanks, so its not only my network
[none]	[14:26]	<mattycoze>	How do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[none]	[14:26]	<sanozuke>	how to you guys and girls read so fast
[none]	[14:26]	<IndyGunFreak>	JPSmon: lol, i think it would create a comedy of errors
[none]	[14:26]	<Sajuukkhar>	we dont
[none]	[14:26]	<bazhang>	loder well I would stick with gutsy until 804.1 if you know what I mean
[none]	[14:26]	<Heroin>	slytherin:  what is gnupg?
[none]	[14:26]	<immesys>	sanozuke: you don't you just look for your name and the name of the person you're talking to
[none]	[14:26]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, the problem is that i must finish the upgrade as soon as possible...so i don't know how long it'll take before having a response in the forums...
[none]	[14:27]	<evand>	JPSmon: ...it would work.
[none]	[14:27]	<arstanj>	immeys: I'm pretty much understand that ubuntu iso mirrors lags, but repos... esp they differ from country to country....
[none]	[14:27]	<JPSmon>	LOL, how?
[none]	[14:27]	<bazhang>	!tab | sanozuke
[none]	[14:27]	<Voxxi>	nickthorley: Maybe it was detected correctly, but not configured properly. Does it show up under the System > Admin > Network?
[none]	[14:27]	<ubotu>	sanozuke: You can use <tab> for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[none]	[14:27]	<nickthorley>	gord_: ok no prob - will just have to install and then if cant get it working revert back to 7.10
[none]	[14:27]	<N1NCHN41L5>	was only partly caps so they know its not M$ dual boot - text moves so fast
[none]	[14:27]	<slytherin>	Heroin: it is implementation of public-key cryptography
[positive]	[14:27]	<IndyGunFreak>	evand: you really think so?.. i seriously doubt it would
[none]	[14:27]	<jojomas>	well.. lets all do a fresh install of 7.10, and then upgrade to 8.04... this is feeling like windows man
[none]	[14:27]	<bhsx>	slytherin: that's interesting.. i hadn't realized that.... i'm actually uninstalling and installing sun-java6-plugin to see if i can tell a difference on any applets
[none]	[14:27]	<mattycoze>	How do i check whether i've manually installed an old version of bluez-utils correctly?
[none]	[14:27]	<JPSmon>	evand, would i dual boot my linux?
[none]	[14:27]	<fysa>	is there a Wubi channel?
[none]	[14:27]	<bazhang>	jojomas: far from it
[none]	[14:27]	<pallavi>	Hi
[none]	[14:27]	<jojomas>	jaja, just kidding
[none]	[14:27]	<fysa>	I boot into initramfs every time.
[none]	[14:27]	<slytherin>	pallavi: you may want to join #ubuntu-in. You have high chance of getting answers there
[none]	[14:28]	<ifireball>	mattycoze: try using it?
[none]	[14:28]	<evand>	JPSmon: IndyGunFreak I've seen it with my own eyes.  The lead developer works in Ubuntu, it's kind of a necessity.  But it's only useful for testing that it created the right things and put them in the right place.
[none]	[14:28]	<pallavi>	ya Thanks for assistance
[none]	[14:28]	<sanozuke>	you guys
[none]	[14:28]	<gord_>	 nickthorley : yep but not too hard to install then configure stuff once it's on your disk, but near-impossibkle to remaster a live-cd that way for specific card u see
[none]	[14:28]	<dassouki>	when i do an lsb_release -a i get 8.04 hardy !
[none]	[14:28]	<nickthorley>	"bazhang: what did you have to do to get it going - I think we need to get out of having to ""fix"" it - if it auto worked before then why not in a later version - I love linux and want to get more people into it but if the way to get your card working is to play with kernel modules then i cant help but thinking we are going backwards not forwards"
[none]	[14:28]	<sanozuke>	are a lot of time online
[none]	[14:28]	<evand>	fysa: no, just a forum and website.
[none]	[14:28]	<v0lksman>	"GNUtoo:  I'm not sure how installing the drivers manually is going to help though...no matter what when you install a new kernel you need to create the modules for it...Envy does it for you while the ""Ubuntu"" way (which isn't cause Ubuntu Way means no proprietary software) you have to do it by hand...."
[none]	[14:28]	<halll0>	can anyone help with a permissions problem I'm having?
[none]	[14:28]	<N1NCHN41L5>	yes /j #wubi - only 1 person in it now
[positive]	[14:28]	<IndyGunFreak>	evand: well, i'd have to see that to believe it
[none]	[14:28]	<ibleed>	how do i encrypt a partition that requires me to give a password when i want to access it (not on boot but manually) ?
[none]	[14:28]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: this is hardy right?
[none]	[14:28]	<loder>	IndyGunFreak it might even work though - that very last version of Wine is startlingly good - it even runs Dreamweaver with bit of tweaking now - that amazed me!
[none]	[14:28]	<nickthorley>	gord_: no prob - thanks for your help - will install it tonight
[none]	[14:28]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: yes hardy
[none]	[14:29]	<sanozuke>	how to i use tab to search for program
[positive]	[14:29]	<JPSmon>	evand: So there wouldnt be a dual boot then?
[none]	[14:29]	<v0lksman>	GNUtoo:  I honestly think EnvyNG will fix your upgrade issue though...the app is more closely integrated for Hardy then it was in the past...he worked with Ubuntu devs to make a lot happen...
[none]	[14:29]	<evand>	IndyGunFreak: bzr branch lp:wubi wubi; cd wubi; make prerequisites; make; make test
[none]	[14:29]	<evand>	JPSmon: I'm not sure I understand your question.  Can you elaborate on what you want to accomplish?
[none]	[14:29]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, what i mean by ubuntu way is trough the restricted hardware gui which install the nvidia module package wich would be updated if the kernel is updated
[none]	[14:29]	<neeto>	How do I set the color depth in 8.04?
[none]	[14:29]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: they moved from the ipw3945 to the iwl3945 and the transition has been a bit rocky; but the new kernel level module means no restricted driver and much better performance
[positive]	[14:30]	<nullmind>	neeto: you still have to use xorg.conf :-/
[none]	[14:30]	<loder>	Is there a search in this chan where i can look up things I don't know like what EnvyNG is?
[none]	[14:30]	<slytherin>	sanozuke: what do you mean?
[none]	[14:30]	<ifireball>	sanozuke: you start typing its name in the command line and then press tab, it should then either complete the name or give you completion options
[none]	[14:30]	<Adlai>	!envy | loder

[none]	[14:30]	<jhoc2x>	how to upgrade from gutsy to hardy?
[none]	[14:30]	<evand>	JPSmon: ah, indeed.
[none]	[14:30]	<sanozuke>	i don't use irc a lot
[none]	[14:31]	<nullmind>	How can I receive notifications whenever a command is executed?
[none]	[14:31]	<indian_munnda>	can any one tell me any software package to change my MAC id????
[none]	[14:31]	<bhsx>	gangsterlicious: because it's getting POUNDED?
[none]	[14:31]	<sanozuke>	but is channel is the best
[none]	[14:31]	<slytherin>	jhoc2x: check channel topic
[none]	[14:31]	<IndyGunFreak>	bazhang: so is envy considered safe now, for Hardy?
[none]	[14:31]	<gangsterlicious>	hmmm, ok
[none]	[14:31]	<arthur>	@ jhoc2x sudo apt-get update   and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[none]	[14:31]	<loder>	Oh I do remember, people with Nvidia drivers especially use it  yeah?
[positive]	[14:31]	<Adlai>	nullmind: what sort of notifications?
[none]	[14:31]	<bhsx>	look at it this way... there are 1500 ppl IN HERE
[none]	[14:31]	<nickthorley>	gord_: yes i fully understand - is it possible that after installing and patching the card may be auto detected and work - the updates fixing it or is this highly unlikely?
[none]	[14:31]	<shane2peru>	does anyone know if a bug was filed for gnome-desktop install on the server edition?
[none]	[14:31]	<bazhang>	loder you can /msg ubotu info packagename or /msg ubotu keyword for lots of stuff
[none]	[14:31]	<jhoc2x>	arthur: thanks bro!
[none]	[14:31]	<JPSmon>	and then ran a wubi in the wubi's wine?
[none]	[14:31]	<spiniker>	hello room
[none]	[14:31]	<vbabiy-laptop>	hey guys is there any way to install the Ubuntu plugin back in to firefox 3.
[none]	[14:31]	<bhsx>	think of what the server, trying to dish-out 650MB isos AND updates is goign through?
[none]	[14:31]	<nullmind>	Adlai: basically like how libnotify notifies you a file has moved, etc., i need to know when something is executed
[positive]	[14:31]	<bazhang>	IndyGunFreak: it is blessed ;] for hardy only though
[none]	[14:31]	<shane2peru>	Does anyone have a workaround for getting the gnome desktop installed on server edition?
[none]	[14:32]	<GNUtoo>	v0lksman, i know it's possible to install the card without envy because a guy(wich is away) succeeded to install it with the gui in ubuntu
[none]	[14:32]	<IndyGunFreak>	bazhang: very interesting
[none]	[14:32]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: which plugin?
[none]	[14:32]	<gord_>	<indian_munnda: macchanger, or mac-changer  from my memory, some card will take it as ifconfig option too
[none]	[14:32]	<spiniker>	i just updated to the new hardy,but i cant seem to get my emerald themes to run
[none]	[14:32]	<loder>	bazhang thanks - in some ways my installs worked so well I didn't learn so much
[none]	[14:32]	<nullmind>	shane2peru: install ubuntu-desktop package?
[negative]	[14:32]	<MTecknology>	If anybody still wants a copy, I have i386-desktop at ftp://arnescnp.com user: ftp pass: <anything>  I'm uploading amd64-desktop to the server now.... limit - 7 connections
[positive]	[14:32]	<Adlai>	nullmind: you can replace the binary with a trojan that sends you some mail and then executes the program
[positive]	[14:32]	<loder>	There's an irony there somewhere :)
[none]	[14:32]	<lilg111111>	anybody know how to get youtube to work in hardy
[none]	[14:32]	<evand>	IndyGunFreak: aiui, yes.  Or at least moreso than it was.
[none]	[14:32]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: the one that comes installed by default with firefox 3.
[none]	[14:32]	<slytherin>	shane2peru: you haven't stated the problem you faced, yet
[none]	[14:32]	<Adlai>	then drop that somewhere in your path
[none]	[14:32]	<shane2peru>	nullmind, I will give that a try
[none]	[14:32]	<Adlai>	before the real binary
[none]	[14:32]	<ifireball>	shane2peru: installing the ubuntu-desktop package doesn't work for you?
[none]	[14:32]	<evand>	ah, sorry, didn't notice that bazhang replied already.
[none]	[14:32]	<sanozuke>	Iam trying to use perl and things are going better
[none]	[14:32]	<shane2peru>	slytherin, yes, gnome-desktop-environment is brokedn
[none]	[14:32]	<bazhang>	nickthorley: I cant remember offhand but will help you go through it if you wish sometime--there are a couple of bugs that stop some people from using it atm that will be fixed in short order
[none]	[14:32]	<shane2peru>	ifireball, going to try that now
[none]	[14:32]	<sanozuke>	in xubuntu
[none]	[14:33]	<slytherin>	vbabiy-laptop: you need package ubufox
[none]	[14:33]	<vbabiy-laptop>	slytherin: it lets you choose to install flash or gnash, also helps install java
[none]	[14:33]	<nullmind>	Adlai: Yeah, i know, but I need a dynamic way to do this. Can I somehow filter bash?
[none]	[14:33]	<bhsx>	lilg111111: 'sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree'
[none]	[14:33]	<iluminatus>	where is a german help channel for ubuntu ?
[none]	[14:33]	<nullmind>	Adlai: I guess I could replace bash and do my filtering there...
[positive]	[14:33]	<Adlai>	nullmind: I'm not aware of how, if it's possible
[negative]	[14:33]	<nullmind>	Adlai: this is because of this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=763283
[none]	[14:33]	<loder>	one more question - this inclusion of FF3 beta 5?
[none]	[14:33]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i used it but its not working correct.When i changed my MAC id the internet stopped working and when i rebooted my PC, MAC was again changd to the older one.
[none]	[14:33]	<slytherin>	shane2peru: do you just want gnome-desktop?
[none]	[14:34]	<nullmind>	loder: Final Fantasy 3 wasn't released in United States
[none]	[14:34]	<nickthorley>	bazhang: what do you mean by term short order - they will be last to be fixed? - I will be trying to install tonight - approx 8 hours from now if you are around?
[none]	[14:34]	<shane2peru>	ifireball, nullmind -   ahh, sometimes the simple solutions escape me!  I tried gnome, gnome-desktop, gnome-desktop-environment
[none]	[14:34]	<loder>	Will aptitude upgrade it to the release as and when it's avaibable
[none]	[14:34]	<ifireball>	shane2peru: but really if you're gonna do that, install desktop ubuntu and be done with, you're not getting anything from using the server that way

[none]	[15:00]	<Jessid>	﻿dystopianray: Ok man! see you! And thanks a lot!

[none]	[15:09]	<bazhang>	spiniker: gnome hardy? doubtful
[none]	[15:09]	<jburd>	spiniker: Sure.  Give it a try.  You might want to use xubuntu though.
[none]	[15:09]	<usicow>	jburd/bazhang: Im only on SSH though.. do you know how I can do it via the console?
[none]	[15:09]	<cguillermo>	Sajuukkhar, you should reformat your drive first. the easiest way I know to do that without having an os installed is with the alternate cd
[none]	[15:09]	<amenado>	eimajentha1-> it looks like your /dev/sda1 is mounted to /
[none]	[15:09]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i have provided the public IP to the card which was given to me by the ISP.

[none]	[15:10]	<Stockfisch>	is anyone here using epiphany instead of firefox ?

[none]	[15:10]	<DJones>	spiniker: xubuntu might be better for a machine with that spec
[none]	[15:10]	<Ubuntong>	 Does Hardy Heron support compiz on new ATI cards?
[none]	[15:10]	<eimajentha1>	amenado: yes, but it's commented out, why is that?
[none]	[15:10]	<sletak>	I've checked the forum but didnt see any recent hits, my new hardy is hanging when syncing to the repository on Translation-en_US.  Seemed to be some hits in google going back to each release.  Anyone else gettign this?
[none]	[15:10]	<spiniker>	no imean i have 7.10 installed right now..but i think it's slowing down..
[none]	[15:10]	<jburd>	usicow: Or you'll need to manually edit: /etc/apt/sources.list
[none]	[15:10]	<Nith>	Sake: there is putty for linux

[none]	[15:11]	<Nith>	rohan: do you have a second computer (linux)?
[none]	[15:11]	<bazhang>	fatty okay; change gutsy to hardy in sources.list then sudo apt-get update  followed by sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (and wait for a bit as a ton of packages are downloaede)
[none]	[15:11]	<sletak>	Sake: what are you trying to accomplish?  Do you need wyse60 emulation or something?
[none]	[15:11]	<jburd>	rohan: Mount the ISO to a point.
[none]	[15:11]	<eimajentha1>	amenado: I see!  the UUID identifies the filesystem, and /dev/sda1 is just there for my benefit?
[positive]	[15:11]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: ;) , yes it is a direct connection to the ISP.
[positive]	[15:12]	<rohan>	jburd: but then what?

[none]	[15:15]	<snadge>	"how do i ""force"" gutsy to update to hardy using the install cd? (after its already failed once and no longer prompts to upgrade)"
[none]	[15:15]	<ddrplayer512>	I'll try later.
[none]	[15:15]	<Sajuukkhar>	nibs, i have 25 kb/s internet

[none]	[15:15]	<unimatrix9>	from gnome menu systeem..
[none]	[15:15]	<frieze>	Nith: thanks. I thought that when I ran ssh -Y it was doing forwarding but my understanding was that all teh gui stuff was happening on the remote machine using my local machine as a display. Since it seems like server and client are used interchangeably in x11 terminology I may have gotten that back-to-front
[none]	[15:15]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: no i can't ping anything other than my ISP server(the server to which i login before using).

[none]	[15:16]	<jones>	makke: do i need to remove the 3 version?
[none]	[15:16]	<rohan>	Nith: there's no PXE server available for windows? anyway, for that you'd need the alternate disc, right?
[none]	[15:16]	<Sajuukkhar>	so what happens if the alternate cd doesnt work? do i just give up and go back to dapper drake?
[none]	[15:16]	<amenado>	unimatrix9-> try  ctrl+alt+F1 to F5 to test the log on  <-- to test it first

[none]	[15:17]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i can only ping my gateway nothing else.
[none]	[15:17]	<makkbe>	so you will have to choose for yourself which one to start
[none]	[15:17]	<jburd>	rohan: Some of us can't do clean installs without going to great lengths

[positive]	[15:18]	<rohan>	jburd: i seem to be one of them, and only for a lack of a cd :-/
[none]	[15:18]	<amenado>	rohan-> what do you consider clean install? you can try something like from install from scratch with  debootstrap  but for now only available is 7.10 not 8.04 yet
[none]	[15:18]	<ddrplayer512>	I really like that new thing where you can use the desktop CD and choose the option to just Install Ubuntu. Has anyone tried that?

[none]	[15:19]	<makkbe>	artti: no
[none]	[15:19]	<snadge>	can anyone tell me how to make it so when i insert the alternate install cd to my gutsy install.. it prompts me to upgrade?? its only done it once, and no longer asks me.. there must be some temp files laying around or something?\
[none]	[15:19]	<tomd123>	artti: no

[none]	[15:20]	<makkbe>	Ubuntong: yes, no worries here
[none]	[15:21]	<gord_>	"indian_munnda: so, to recap you have used macchanger to change a mac, verified it in ifconfig, assigned manual public as given by ISP, and you can ping your default gateway at the ISP. You have a direct network connection (no modem/router involved)? ideas anyone? i susspect this isnt an ubuntu problem, more a ""spoof mac to get public IP on a new-box"" question, different channel suggestions anyone?"

[positive]	[15:21]	<ddrplayer512>	bazhang: Yeah, I know. But I figured that the repos would be flooded, and I wanted Hardy NOW. So... :)
[positive]	[15:21]	<jburd>	vwbusguy-: Don't unless you're experimenting with the kernel.
[none]	[15:22]	<qryzy>	my friend has installed it but it wont browse or see other pc on the network
[none]	[15:22]	<amenado>	vwbusguy--> you have to compile your kernel to support such new file system
[none]	[15:22]	<W8TAH>	when doing a dual boot install, one should install windows first, correct???
[none]	[15:22]	<slytherin>	cal_: some hp laptop enable to boot. not sure of it is same as your problem

[none]	[15:22]	<amenado>	qryzy-> you have to be clearer on what the problem is, detail or elaborate your network layout
[none]	[15:22]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: What is the original problem?
[none]	[15:22]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: so we just need to restart networking maybe
[none]	[15:23]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: but i did that too
[none]	[15:23]	<cal_>	sly: hmm lauchpad is a sourceforge clone?
[none]	[15:23]	<vwbusguy->	So ext4 is not supported in 8.04?
[none]	[15:23]	<ddrplayer512>	The rule of thumb is... Older versions of Windows to Newer Versions, then other OSes like Ubuntu/Linux, FreeBSD, etc.
[none]	[15:23]	<slytherin>	bakom: At the login screen I think you have an option for some recovery.
[none]	[15:23]	<amenado>	bakom  try  crtl+alt+ +  the last + is the plus in the numeric keypad

[none]	[15:24]	<bakom>	is there a way to change the screen resolution via console?

[none]	[15:29]	<P0larBear>	the right codecs to download ubuntu 8.04?
[none]	[15:29]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Which ISP is this?  And why are you changing your MAC?
[none]	[15:29]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	is the server for downloading the respotories naturally slow?

[negative]	[15:30]	<ampex>	is http://us.archive.ubuntu.com down?
[none]	[15:31]	<murlidhar>	P0larBear, right-click on the panel and select brightness control
[none]	[15:31]	<slytherin>	P0larBear: brigheness control won't work if there is problem the way your laptop's ACPI works. Better file a bug
[none]	[15:31]	<bazhang>	gkhnoisgtht: the server is install only not live
[positive]	[15:31]	<indian_munnda>	jburd: i m having two computer systems when i try to run net in the other one it does not working because MAC is registered to the ISP server.
[none]	[15:31]	<slytherin>	ampex: that mirror is always known to have problems. I wonder why is it even included in mirror lists
[none]	[15:31]	<gkhnoisgtht>	could the desktop version be configured as such?
[none]	[15:31]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I think it's a bit fast in here.  you can /join ##linux-india I guess.

[none]	[15:32]	<slytherin>	ampex: can't say. I am not in US.
[none]	[15:32]	<JohnMM>	indian_munnda, comcast does that too ...use a router
[none]	[15:32]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: I guessed so.  You probably have a static IP address bound to your MAC by your ISP's gateway.
[none]	[15:32]	<indian_munnda>	gord_: i did the same as you said and it even stopped pinging my ISP srver
[none]	[15:32]	<ampex>	slytherin: is there a list somewhere?
[none]	[15:32]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The best solution is to use a router and tell them to use the hardware address of the router.
[none]	[15:32]	<Frijolie>	does Hardy have Compiz or Compiz-Fusion installed, how do you check?
[none]	[15:33]	<edugonch_>	7join #ubuntu-devel
[none]	[15:33]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: Then connect both computers to the router (using a switch if required)
[none]	[15:33]	<slytherin>	ampex: you will have to search. There is definitely a list on wiki.ubuntu.com or launchpad.net. Search for word 'mirror'
[none]	[15:33]	<edugonch_>	7join #ubuntu-dev
[none]	[15:33]	<roychri>	slytherin: I changed, hit reload, and it complained about some files not found.

[positive]	[15:33]	<indian_munnda>	jburd: yes you r write its a static ip
[none]	[15:33]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The other solution is to set up the already configured machine as a proxy for the other machine.
[none]	[15:33]	<Frijolie>	bazhang: huh?
[none]	[15:33]	<slytherin>	roychri: which files?
[none]	[15:33]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	whats the best video editor for linux? or is it better to just use virtualbox and install adobe premiere on windows?
[none]	[15:33]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: bridge both network interfaces one to wan and the other to lan
[none]	[15:34]	<roychri>	PAckages.gz
[none]	[15:34]	<roychri>	slytherin: Packages.gz
[none]	[15:34]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: MAC spoofing isn't a very ideal solution.
[none]	[15:34]	<slytherin>	mib_5klyf1zq: you may want to try kino or pitivi
[none]	[15:34]	<mib_5klyf1zq>	wat about cinelerra?
[none]	[15:34]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: a switch will cost you somewhere around 900 bucks INR.
[none]	[15:34]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: yeah far simpler if other machine is still working

[positive]	[15:35]	<gord_>	indian_munnda: ah yes u did say, i no expert on that , but it might comlicate
[none]	[15:35]	<amenado>	mrTr0ut-> then what are you waiting for? modify it to suit your new install
[none]	[15:35]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: No.  I mean use a switch.   Not a hub.
[none]	[15:35]	<Pilha>	ahaa, before even asking I have my answer
[none]	[15:35]	<cvw>	roychri: your comment is unhelpful without a link to a list that can provide local servers or mirrors.
[none]	[15:35]	<jburd>	indian_munnda: The best solution is to use a router with your ISP.

[none]	[16:02]	<Turms_gutsy>	mosno: ok, i never had the need to use luks, so you may be right, but for a normal user (as the 99% are) there is no need to have /boot in a separate partition

[none]	[16:03]	<mosno>	Turms_gutsy: /boot is also handy if you decide to get rid of Ubuntu but you want your bootloader to not break (you just leave /boot alone)

[none]	[16:05]	<darren_>	ok the video is playing verry choppy
[none]	[16:05]	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: the servers are swamped... if you let it sit there for an hour or so it'll probably unfreeze
[none]	[16:05]	<nlindblad>	OllieA: Try lspci and see if the kernel recognises it
[none]	[16:05]	<amenado>	gnychis->    the server side is extremely busy, you may have the perception it is unresponsive and not working..
[none]	[16:05]	<mem_oro_76>	sipior: it says filesystem unknown - it was formatted as hfs+ before but all I want to do is wipe it completely so I can make a new partition
[none]	[16:05]	<andycr>	sipior: A mirror for apt? I'm not sure how I would add a mirror to sources.list.

[none]	[16:07]	<nibsa1242b>	gnychis: you could torrent the alt install CD (or the desktop / alt install DVD) however, I was told if you go that route packages that aren't on the cd/dvd could break during upgrade

[none]	[16:26]	<nikitis>	Flannel, turns out, that was my issue.  I set /boot with a boot flag and it worked

Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  Compositing is off.  I tried re-do
[none]	[22:18]	<instantsoup>	like i said, i add or modify the account, choose icq and add everything, then i save it and it shows the account in the account manager as ICQ but with the AIM symbol next to it

[none]	[22:25]	<drivetrax>	Skipping versions is not advised and can cause a lot of damage to your installation.
[none]	[22:25]	<ravi_>	"daemon3,  check the ""Updates"" tab in Software Sources system settings"
[none]	[22:25]	<nuSharper>	another question, a given program that, when installed in Ubuntu, works out of the box without the need of extra configuration (due to codecs, let's say), would also work straight after the installation in Xubuntu?
[none]	[22:25]	<lunartear>	i have public key access working from user_x@host1 to userx@host2, but using the same public key on user_y@host2  goes directly to password auth, The key is silently failing for user_y?
[none]	[22:25]	<crimsun>	graingert: install padevchooser
[none]	[22:25]	<daemon3>	ubotu2: I've followed those directions.
[none]	[22:26]	<hwilde>	mistapapa, pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces file please
[none]	[22:26]	<drivetrax>	If you are using an earlier version, and want to 'skip' a version, the only safe way is to backup your data and do a fresh install, or to progressively upgrade to each successive version.
[none]	[22:26]	<noodlesgc>	nuSharper it should. the only way to be completely sure is to try
[none]	[22:26]	<hwilde>	lunartear, ssh -vvv    it will show you verbose output
[none]	[22:26]	<romanotp>	thanx guys for the help, see you soon
[none]	[22:26]	<lunartear>	hwilde ok
[none]	[22:26]	<mistapapa>	hwilde: kk
[none]	[22:26]	<daemon3>	chubs730: I know, it should.  But it doesn't.
[none]	[22:26]	<noodlesgc>	drivetrax i thought they made it possible to upgrade between LTS's
[none]	[22:26]	<drivetrax>	The LTS version is recommended for people in an environment (generally commercial/industrial) that want to keep the same version for a longer amount of time and do not require newer/faster/updated versions, but instead do not want things to change.
[none]	[22:26]	<jpruskin>	!lilo
[none]	[22:26]	<ubotu>	lilo is an alternative [Li]nux Boot[Lo]ader. Note: it is recommended that you use GRUB on Ubuntu instead.

[none]	[22:27]	<lunartear>	hwilde, i did that
[none]	[22:27]	<daemon3>	chubs730: Right.  It doesn't do anything.
[none]	[22:27]	<Swian>	really because it stated on the ubuntu site you could uninstall
[none]	[22:27]	<foosh>	its ext3 and i've just had defaults on in the past to successful rw for all users
[none]	[22:27]	<foosh>	its just a storage partition

It has the right shape, but instead of the title bar, frame, close button, etc it is just solid black.  I can click where the buttons should be and they work, but they're not visible.  Window decorations on all my other apps (at least the ones I've used so far) have been fine.  Compositing is off.  I tried re-do
[none]	[22:27]	<hwilde>	chubs730, he has to change his repos in /etc/apt/sources.list   he needs to follow instructions from ubotu

[none]	[22:28]	<Pilha>	cool, so I've got my boot order right
[none]	[22:28]	<kindofabuzz>	for those of you that have broadcom chips wireless, all i did was edit /etc/modeprobe.d/blacklist, add blacklist b43 and blacklisttssb and uncomment blacklist bcm43xx, reboot, boom i have wireless
[none]	[22:28]	<mohbana>	hwilde: i hope i was clear, why aren't they any themes to start of with?
[none]	[22:28]	<graingert>	crimsun: it it possible to stream over the internet?
[none]	[22:28]	<chuy_max>	"hi, I had hardy heron beta installed, now I wanted to upgrade to stable via update-manager, but I get a message telling me that ""Not all updates can be installed"", any ideas?"
[negative]	[22:28]	<MRutter>	hwilde: those troubleshooting guides don't seem to apply. Spring uses openal, which defaults to using OSS. under 7.10 Spring worked fine, but with 8.04 it only works if its the only audio application running.

[none]	[22:29]	<Pilha>	I had installed (via Synaptic) linux-rt in Ubuntu7.10; after upgrade to 8.04 I find myself with too many linuxes to boot from, it seems
[none]	[22:29]	<graingert>	crimsun: that's all enabled
[none]	[22:29]	<crimsun>	hwilde: no, that's due to the way pulseaudio is configured, which I'm attempting to alter for 8.04.1.
[none]	[22:29]	<chuy_max>	is it safe to upgrade?

When I login with console, and try to do apt-get upgrade or apt-get -f install it says that dpkg-divert rename involves overwriting /sbin/depmod with different file, not allowed.

[none]	[23:32]	<unop>	Veinor, you can use an ISO offline like that sure, but it needs to be an alternate CD ISO not the normal live CD

[none]	[23:34]	<hwilde>	szenti, if you want to.  it's a personal preference

[none]	[23:36]	<nucco>	southafrikanse: check your ~/.firefox folder or wherever firefox hides its settings, you might find something deletable there

[none]	[23:58]	<zeeeee>	hwilde, that just tells me to run dpkg --configure -a
[positive]	[23:58]	<nucco>	Steve^ the logical partition also counts as part of the 4 maximum :)
[none]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	Got a problem with intel pro wireless 3945 abg network adapter
[none]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	not seeing any networks
[none]	[23:58]	<Steve^>	nucco, I  have the 80 gigs of free space. I select logical and it appears to just make it as a normal parition. There is nothing in the table to indicate it is logical
[none]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	suspected driver bug
[none]	[23:58]	<hwilde>	"zeeeee, sorry that's way over my head.  you need to install those things that says ""Package x11-xfs-utils is not installed""  bcause the other things depend on it"
[none]	[23:58]	<B166erx>	Seamus7 i think i'm trying to 'get it' ..Ubuntu, while trying to make it simple, just keep Frakkin up everything for old timers like me.  Instead of having to go in Fstab, create a folder in /media, ect...   Hardy auto mount and detect the drives...and simply name them 'Media  **gig'     , But since i upgraded, i still have the Fstab lines and all, maybe thats it..
[none]	[23:58]	<ethana2>	i'm helping a guy out, his wireless isn't working, but there's no sensical reason for that
[none]	[23:58]	<nucco>	Steve^ when you make logical, that gives you 3 partitions including the windows ones right?
[none]	[23:59]	<hansengel>	Hi, I just updated to Hardy and for some reason the sound is REALLY quiet.
[negative]	[23:59]	<roffe__>	unop: I did both the commands you gave me now, and still an error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64444/
[none]	[23:59]	<hansengel>	If I raise the volume to the highest it can go, it's a normal level
[none]	[23:59]	<zeeeee>	hwilde, yeah, i read the messages too, but the upgrade process was completely hosed
[none]	[23:59]	<hansengel>	My speakers are as high as they can go also
[positive]	[23:59]	<nucco>	ethana2: explain the problem please, better chances of getting help that way
[negative]	[23:59]	<zeeeee>	http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/222096 is what happened
[none]	[23:59]	<Steve^>	"nucco, yea, its working like I thought. You don't make a logical partition. You make them all with the ""logical"" option, it assigned them to sda5,6,7 and it'll make the logical bit for you"
[none]	[23:59]	<KooperKool>	What happens if I remove ubuntu-desktop?
[none]	[23:59]	<KrimZon>	what's that acpi script in hardy where you can enable/disable laptop-mode?
[none]	[23:59]	<hwilde>	KooperKool, what do you think man?  it uninstalls the desktop
[none]	[23:59]	<Steve^>	nucco, its trying to be user friendly and therefore confusing people who know what they want
[none]	[23:59]	<josh04>	KooperKool: nothing, it's a meta-package

[negative] [03:42] <mzaza> SmSpillaz: it's just when ubuntuforums had the tags for fiesty i found a topic for solving this problem easily. its just they removed the tags i can't find it :(
[positive] [03:43] <Fin> calculator:  Try k3b? :)
[negative] [03:43] <delmorep> mzaza: you might try beryl instead -- its in the repos now, remove compiz first.... ive never had any problems with beryl... but i had so many problems with compiz :( sometimes the close-X's on progams dont work... similar black screen problems that youve had too
[positive] [03:44] <NemesisD> randomwalker, very interesting >:)
[positive] [03:45] <Brade1> :)
[positive] [03:45] <delmorep> :) i cant believe they went with compiz... i know it has a better long term value... but im pretty sure the beryl team thought it was gonna be them... was probably a harsh letdown
[negative] [03:48] <tom_> :(
[positive] [03:50] <KevinOoO> :)
[negative] [03:53] <NemesisD> blazemonger, im sorry to hear that :(
[positive] [03:56] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [03:57] <Jordan_U_> blazemonger, You could find the developers responsible for midi hardware support and donate testing time / money / hardware ( they can't make it work if they don't have it :)
[positive] [03:57] <dudu1982> hehehe :)
[negative] [03:57] <randomwalker> NemesisD: :( so its either keyboard shortcuts or snazzy effects
[positive] [04:03] <rbrtoclto> pelo: sweet, that's done the trick :)
[positive] [04:03] <KevinOoO> :) sorry
[positive] [04:04] <BSG76> my mythtv settop has been working amazingly for last 4 years now :)
[negative] [04:04] <rbrtoclto> xt: had any problems?  there was a race condition between some scripts in the beta that caused 9/10 boots to fail, I've only booted twice running feisty release and one has failed :(
[positive] [04:04] <Tom47> BSG76 oops sorry you are the expert :)
[positive] [04:04] <BSG76> no backend in on a my machine in the living room :)
[positive] [04:05] <BSG76> lol been using myth since early versions .. I just don't know how it is setup in ubuntu :) ... normally use gentoo .. love ubuntu though :)
[positive] [04:06] <BSG76> thanks ubotu .. I visited that already .. it's very basic at best :)
[positive] [04:08] <BSG76> however my lack of knowledge of ubuntu is surely haunting me right now :)
[positive] [04:11] <delmorep> Impaque: awesome! thanks a million my friend :)
[positive] [04:18] <Jordan_U_> delmorep, wget -c for bad connections ( will keep re-trying ) :)
[positive] [04:21] <locke1689> msand: depends :)
[positive] [04:26] <Jordan_U_> jimmygoon, I disagree about using NDIS wrapper :) But in what way won't it remove ( and BTW there is an official broadcom firmware package in the Ubuntu repos )
[positive] [04:26] <vadvad> hi! new user in need here :)

[positive] [04:32] <behdad> towsonu2003: thanku man i got it its free space is 0 now :)
[positive] [04:34] <Jordan_U> jimmygoon, probably a good idea, I can't think of what that package could have been trying to do, it should be very simple, but if whoever made it didn't know that such a thing already existed they probably can't be trusted to greatly :)
[positive] [04:36] <vadvad> i trust u :)
[positive] [04:42] <huXfluX> zeroday: thank you! the toshiba sound fix worked like a charm :)
[positive] [04:43] <Ax4> stelios, you can go into control panel -> administrative tools -> computer management -> disk management -> and select the partition, then "SHRINK" it down, then reboot using the ubuntu live cd and partition the ubuntu install into that empty space you make :)
[positive] [04:44] <stelios> Ax4: may i ask why is needed to shrink the partition?(sorry i'm new to this :)
[positive] [04:47] <ubotu> zazeem: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[negative] [04:49] <zazeem> :(

[negative] [08:59] <DARKGuy> _3uG_: I'm sorry then :(... basically, all you have to do is to remove anything ubuntu related to nvidia, and just reinstall the nvidia driver - I admit, they made it damn harder now >.<

[positive] [05:50] <Krige^> poningru: ah, I thought it was a verb :) why should I use deluge in place of Azureus? Is that the advised torrent application in Ubuntu?
[positive] [05:51] <antidrugue> delire: just a joke about... "i don't like to talk about myself on IRC", yet we all know your IP :)
[positive] [05:52] <Krige^> poningru: thanks for the suggestion :) is that what you personally use?

[positive] [06:17] <rsk> lobosque: GCC handles many languages, chek wikipedia it has a good list. so not only c :)
[positive] [06:19] <apo> cornucopia: I just looked at it... it seems to want /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source/, but I don't have the kernel sources there... Perhaps extracting them there might help :)
[negative] [06:28] <richieoxford> there must be a way of having things so that users can just quickly "install" software without any technical knowledge, otherwise i cant promote it instead of windows :(
[positive] [06:33] <frolle> I am having some problems with hellanzb: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17073/ - can anybody help me? :)

[positive] [06:56] <misfit_toy> before I reboot, I'd like to ask one more time, I've used "startupmanager" which is supposedly compatible with feisty now to change my usplash, but I'd like to hear from someone that this is true before I reboot. :)
[positive] [07:05] <andi5> OatTop: for all files, even PDFs? ... i do not know whether this is very helpful :)
[positive] [07:06] <andi5> OatTop: i wonder, because if you love emacs, then use dired :)
[positive] [07:09] <atomiku> delight: thanks dude i'll check it out :)
[positive] [07:09] <pipak> Hello, I have a problem with upgrade from edgy to feisty (xorg related). Could someone help me?  :)

[positive] [07:21] <ubotu> vadvad: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive] [07:21] <andi5> joeyj: i can say "kvm, vmware-player and xen", but still do not know what i will decide for once my memory has arrived :)
[positive] [07:24] <qebab> antidrugue: it's more that I wanted to use what I'm already familiar with if it wouldn't be hard to set up :) I've got no problem using another IDE if I have to
[positive] [07:27] <qebab> and you are quite right delire, emacs and vim don't seem to be my thing :) a bit too strange for me still
[positive] [07:28] <andi5> noelferreira: i think that typically every installation of a library ends with running `ldconfig', so i do not understand that :)
[positive] [07:29] <qebab> antidrugue: one of my friend usually says that Vim is for sys admin kinds of people, emacs is for crazy people and always adds as an afterthought that he uses emacs :)
[positive] [07:30] <andi5> harris: i mean 600, of course :)
[positive] [07:33] <grayman> abo, wrong person :)
[negative] [07:40] <xeshm> :(
[positive] [07:41] <ramirand> Dante123: I've had WEP on for years... no hacks that I can report. But then again, my neighbor operates wide open -- who'd bother hacking me? :)
[positive] [07:41] <taggie> Dante123; i'd say wide-open is fine. you shouldn't be using cleartext protocols, and you shouldn't bridge directly to your private network, but sharing is nice :)
[positive] [07:42] <antidrugue> andi5: i have a few 75 footer here :)
[positive] [07:42] <andi5> antidrugue: great, where can i download that? :)
[positive] [07:43] <surviver> igge, well bind it to a key and press it :) or try to find a way to set it to a user so only specciefd users can access the rw
[negative] [07:44] <xeshm> :(
[positive] [07:44] <igge> surviver: hm won't do.. :) But it should be possible to configure HAL or something...

[negative] [09:11] <CarlFK> Meshezabeel: or tell me where to get them, and I''ll get it :(
[positive] [09:12] <Meshezabeel> lol, carlfk, people just selling them on a linux list. But it is in Canada :) I guess it would be closer to $12 american :)
[positive] [09:14] <talisein> Drk_Gu1: So, their file is really aimed at Red Hat. I'm having a tough time getting to the file ubuntu needs. So please give me some more time :)

I'm having the problem with permissions and owners when trying to log in.  I've been googling for a solution, but I can't seem to find one.  I had this problem in the past and was able to get help here, so I'm here again.  :)  Any ideas?

[02:34] <ubotu> debaser: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:36] <TirEoghain> I was able to download the ISO in 27mins, I am in Ireland and I guess the Irish mirrors just aren't that busy :)
[02:38] <VividHazE> I entered the IP address and it still didn't work :(
[02:40] <VividHazE> :)
[02:40] <Ax4> zipped20x, yes, im finding it for you, sec :)
[02:41] <rookiehwm> my keyboard shortcut isn't working :( alt-f2 is still opening the gnome terminal, not aterm
[02:41] <stp2007> randomwalker, I was doing the other stuff on my other laptop :)
[02:48] <ubotu> mistaWAC: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[02:50] <NobleCommerc1> nope :(
[02:54] <Impaque> TirEoghain: no idea :( try following the guide again, sorry
[03:08] <randomwalker> eck: that wasn't me :)
[03:08] <Stormx2> debaser: Great album :)
[03:11] <VividHazE> Impaque: Am I screwed then, I was hoping to have all my files on the one computer so the other computers and laptops in the house could read it from them :(
[03:23] <ardchoille> Kevin: You're welcome :)
[03:27] <Ax4> eck, http://rafb.net/p/9pFspp21.html <---- if you have a sec :)
[03:31] <Fujitsu> zipped20x: They're called stable for a reason :)
[03:34] <Ax4> k :)
[03:36] <Ax4> eck, Fujitsu , libssl-dev did the trick! :)
[03:36] <Fujitsu> Ax4: Great :)
[03:42] <mzaza> SmSpillaz: it's just when ubuntuforums had the tags for fiesty i found a topic for solving this problem easily. its just they removed the tags i can't find it :(
[03:43] <Fin> calculator:  Try k3b? :)
[03:43] <delmorep> mzaza: you might try beryl instead -- its in the repos now, remove compiz first.... ive never had any problems with beryl... but i had so many problems with compiz :( sometimes the close-X's on progams dont work... similar black screen problems that youve had too
[03:44] <NemesisD> randomwalker, very interesting >:)
[03:45] <Brade1> :)
[03:45] <delmorep> :) i cant believe they went with compiz... i know it has a better long term value... but im pretty sure the beryl team thought it was gonna be them... was probably a harsh letdown
[03:48] <tom_> :(
[03:50] <KevinOoO> :)
[03:53] <NemesisD> blazemonger, im sorry to hear that :(
[03:56] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:57] <Jordan_U_> blazemonger, You could find the developers responsible for midi hardware support and donate testing time / money / hardware ( they can't make it work if they don't have it :)
[03:57] <dudu1982> hehehe :)
[03:57] <randomwalker> NemesisD: :( so its either keyboard shortcuts or snazzy effects
[04:03] <rbrtoclto> pelo: sweet, that's done the trick :)
[04:03] <KevinOoO> :) sorry
[04:04] <BSG76> my mythtv settop has been working amazingly for last 4 years now :)
[04:04] <rbrtoclto> xt: had any problems?  there was a race condition between some scripts in the beta that caused 9/10 boots to fail, I've only booted twice running feisty release and one has failed :(
[04:04] <Tom47> BSG76 oops sorry you are the expert :)
[04:04] <BSG76> no backend in on a my machine in the living room :)
[04:05] <BSG76> lol been using myth since early versions .. I just don't know how it is setup in ubuntu :) ... normally use gentoo .. love ubuntu though :)
[04:06] <BSG76> thanks ubotu .. I visited that already .. it's very basic at best :)
[04:08] <BSG76> however my lack of knowledge of ubuntu is surely haunting me right now :)
[04:11] <delmorep> Impaque: awesome! thanks a million my friend :)
[04:18] <Jordan_U_> delmorep, wget -c for bad connections ( will keep re-trying ) :)
[04:21] <locke1689> msand: depends :)
[04:26] <Jordan_U_> jimmygoon, I disagree about using NDIS wrapper :) But in what way won't it remove ( and BTW there is an official broadcom firmware package in the Ubuntu repos )
[04:26] <vadvad> hi! new user in need here :)
[04:27] <dager> vavad, just ask :)
[04:30] <behdad> :))) Available space : 0 , thanku all
[04:31] <DeadCowBoy> umop already too late for that :(
[04:31] <stelios> Ax4: i know but it's not working anymore :)
[04:32] <behdad> towsonu2003: thanku man i got it its free space is 0 now :)
[04:34] <Jordan_U> jimmygoon, probably a good idea, I can't think of what that package could have been trying to do, it should be very simple, but if whoever made it didn't know that such a thing already existed they probably can't be trusted to greatly :)
[04:36] <vadvad> i trust u :)
[04:42] <huXfluX> zeroday: thank you! the toshiba sound fix worked like a charm :)
[04:43] <Ax4> stelios, you can go into control panel -> administrative tools -> computer management -> disk management -> and select the partition, then "SHRINK" it down, then reboot using the ubuntu live cd and partition the ubuntu install into that empty space you make :)
[04:44] <stelios> Ax4: may i ask why is needed to shrink the partition?(sorry i'm new to this :)
[04:47] <ubotu> zazeem: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[04:49] <zazeem> :(
[04:56] <towsonu2003> behdad, be careful not to delete everything in your way :)
[04:56] <zazeem> southafrikanse: probably, ubuntu is much more fun though :)
[04:57] <behdad> towsonu2003: :)) man i have to submit 3 asignments and 2 projects i was going to install 7.04 , thanks god for ur help
[04:58] <towsonu2003> behdad, you're welcome :)
[04:58] <stelios> :( i'm lost
[05:00] <zazeem> southafrikanse: i remember a lot though :)
[05:03] <zazeem> Burgundavia: ok thanks :)
[05:03] <behdad> cotton: what do u mean by cant do this :) ?
[05:10] <zak_> NBrepresent, trace bitmap? if you mean trace a bitmap [ie vectorise it] , inkscape will... but if you mean something else, it's probably not in my brain :)
[05:15] <GionnyBoss> linoleum: anjuta is similar to kdevelop... consider eclipse with c plugin. I use this for my university. There's a good debugger inside, too :)

[08:36] <DARKGuy> _3uG_: I'm out of ideas =/ I'd say use envy to uninstall everything nvidia-related, remove linux-restricted-modules, restart comp and try installing the nvidia driver... that's what I did anyways =/ other than that, I have no idea :(
[08:40] <DaMi3n> they dont work :(
[08:41] <nemo_home> liquiddoom: see above :)
[08:45] <DaMi3n> liquiddoom, didnt work :( says [mntent] : line 16 in /etc/fstab is bad
[08:48] <kkathman> liquiddoom,  thanks :)
[08:50] <endlessurf> i lost my sound :(..
[08:56] <zcat[1] > DShepherd, rofl.. obvious things first :)
[08:57] <DaMi3n> liquiddoom, found a way to use spaces :) have to use \040 instead of "\ "
[08:59] <DARKGuy> _3uG_: I'm sorry then :(... basically, all you have to do is to remove anything ubuntu related to nvidia, and just reinstall the nvidia driver - I admit, they made it damn harder now >.<
[09:28] <Toumaz> Jordan_U: Thanks. I'll go try it now :)
[09:30] <Possum> wow, beryl looks good :)

[01:53] <MrEgg964> Hi all :) I'm trying to mount a samba network drive on Feisty. This used to work fine in Edgy, but after I have done a clean install of Feisty, I can't mount it anymore although my fstab is configured the same way it was in Edgy. Any suggestion anyone?
[02:09] <trol0s_> r00tintheb0x: easy to use as well? :)
[02:11] <Baktaah> Could someone help me install java :(
[02:12] <LjL> Samuli^: it's not there by default IIRC, but you can activate it... click on something :) don't remember what
[02:18] <trol0s_> LjL: I see. Thanks very much. I'm new to this as you can understand :)
[02:24] <MrEgg964> HI all :) I need some help mounting a network drive with Feisty. The following fstab command used to work fine under Edgy, but returns an error under Feisty : //192.168.71.119/MusicCenter /mnt/MusicCenter cifs credentials=/root/.credentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0

[04:06] <intangibleLiquid> whenever I try to play music at average or above volume my speakers get sucked, and playing avi stufffs is a nightmare, lots of unrecognizable pictures :(
[04:15] <LjL> robdeman: bwah, xserver-xorg --- no, of course i meant  sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low otrs2 , sorry :)
[04:16] <intangibleLiquid> magnetron: I havent used Linux for a while and it seems I've forgetten almost everything. No expert here :(
[04:19] <Belutz> fastnKS_, ic, i haven't install the LAMP yet, well at least the "send to bluetooth" is now working from nautilus :)
[04:41] <mangojambo> hey people ... help me .. I installed the FEISTY and the sound isn't work ... in EDGY was working fine, but now... and I need to edit a video!! :( but, without sound is impossible!!!
[04:42] <ndr77> hello :)
[04:46] <LjL> robdeman: the guy's on Server as well, while i'm not, that has to mean something... what, i wonder :)
[04:46] <robdeman> LjL: yes exactly.. but mmm what? :)
[05:02] <blubloblu> xtknight: its rediculous the amount of xorg backups i have at this stage! :)
[05:06] <ravenoust> i c:)
[05:12] <ravenoust> ] JacK[ I just went to www.opera.com and downloaded it. And when it downloads u choose to open, not save, and it will start installing. It did it when i downloaded it:)
[05:12] <no_comment> hi @ all :) how can i make a program get started by typing just its name into the console?
[05:19] <Krige^> velko: yes, brand new :)
[05:20] <sldkfj> :)
[05:23] <cotton> :)
[05:23] <dooooomi> hmm... anyway, i want the previous behaviour back. core dumps in the current directory, like it's always been :) but how?
[05:24] <haru> zaeem, i want to add a plugin :)
[05:24] <alpr> renaming didnt help xtknight  :(
[05:26] <haru> zaeem, 9250 :(
[05:28] <haru> zaeem, nope :) it worked out of the box
[05:28] <Krige^> LjL: that's a reasonable explanation :)
[05:29] <Krige^> krux0: thanks mate :)
[05:32] <Enquest> :(

[05:42] <barteks> :(
[05:43] <sorcerer> delire: yeah man it is .. lol your not from america .. lol ioam not i just to college in america something i picked up :)
[05:47] <dooglus> poningru: maybe you could tell him too?  :)
[05:50] <Krige^> poningru: ah, I thought it was a verb :) why should I use deluge in place of Azureus? Is that the advised torrent application in Ubuntu?
[05:51] <antidrugue> delire: just a joke about... "i don't like to talk about myself on IRC", yet we all know your IP :)
[05:52] <Krige^> poningru: thanks for the suggestion :) is that what you personally use?
[05:54] <bur[n] er> gnomefreak: how bout "unofficial" ? :)
[05:55] <retarded> antidrugue if you have a minute it would be appreciated . .(once your done :) )
[05:58] <cash> I upgraded to feisty yesterday, but i'm having freezes, looks like is hardware/interrupts problem... :(  no log errors
[06:00] <Krige^> poningru: so simple? :) Will it automatically update itself?
[06:01] <cash> ponigru: I upgraded to feisty yesterday, but i'm having freezes, looks like is hardware/interrupts problem... :(  no log errors
[06:03] <Krige^> debaser: thanks :)
[06:06] <Aiwuu> debaser, i only get the error :(
[06:07] <sdide> Anyone ever had a problem with ATI binary blobs drivers and Linux? .... :)
[06:13] <foug> debaser: it's world of warcraft :(
[06:17] <rsk> lobosque: GCC handles many languages, chek wikipedia it has a good list. so not only c :)
[06:19] <apo> cornucopia: I just looked at it... it seems to want /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source/, but I don't have the kernel sources there... Perhaps extracting them there might help :)
[06:28] <richieoxford> there must be a way of having things so that users can just quickly "install" software without any technical knowledge, otherwise i cant promote it instead of windows :(
[06:33] <frolle> I am having some problems with hellanzb: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17073/ - can anybody help me? :)
[06:35] <retarded-brb> antidrogue ok . ill try the bios method (laptop :) ) eventhough on the ubuntu-fr forum they sayd it didnt matter . but ill try
[06:48] <mon^rch> Fylk: Amarok :)
[06:49] <foug> debaser: ya i figured, it's cool man :) where ya from btw?
[06:54] <antidrugue> debaser: thanks for what? :)
[06:56] <bliz0r> Can anyone name me some good docks? Needs to be easy to install too :)
[06:56] <misfit_toy> before I reboot, I'd like to ask one more time, I've used "startupmanager" which is supposedly compatible with feisty now to change my usplash, but I'd like to hear from someone that this is true before I reboot. :)
[07:05] <andi5> OatTop: for all files, even PDFs? ... i do not know whether this is very helpful :)
[07:06] <andi5> OatTop: i wonder, because if you love emacs, then use dired :)
[07:09] <atomiku> delight: thanks dude i'll check it out :)
[07:09] <pipak> Hello, I have a problem with upgrade from edgy to feisty (xorg related). Could someone help me?  :)
[07:14] <pipak> Hello, I have a problem with upgrade from edgy to feisty (xorg related). Could someone please help me?  :)
[07:16] <apo> Yay, managed to build tp_smapi :)
[07:21] <ubotu> vadvad: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[07:21] <andi5> joeyj: i can say "kvm, vmware-player and xen", but still do not know what i will decide for once my memory has arrived :)
[07:24] <qebab> antidrugue: it's more that I wanted to use what I'm already familiar with if it wouldn't be hard to set up :) I've got no problem using another IDE if I have to
[07:27] <qebab> and you are quite right delire, emacs and vim don't seem to be my thing :) a bit too strange for me still
[07:28] <andi5> noelferreira: i think that typically every installation of a library ends with running `ldconfig', so i do not understand that :)
[07:29] <qebab> antidrugue: one of my friend usually says that Vim is for sys admin kinds of people, emacs is for crazy people and always adds as an afterthought that he uses emacs :)
[07:30] <andi5> harris: i mean 600, of course :)
[07:33] <grayman> abo, wrong person :)
[07:40] <xeshm> :(
[07:41] <ramirand> Dante123: I've had WEP on for years... no hacks that I can report. But then again, my neighbor operates wide open -- who'd bother hacking me? :)
[07:41] <taggie> Dante123; i'd say wide-open is fine. you shouldn't be using cleartext protocols, and you shouldn't bridge directly to your private network, but sharing is nice :)
[07:42] <antidrugue> andi5: i have a few 75 footer here :)
[07:42] <andi5> antidrugue: great, where can i download that? :)
[07:43] <surviver> igge, well bind it to a key and press it :) or try to find a way to set it to a user so only specciefd users can access the rw
[07:44] <xeshm> :(
[07:44] <igge> surviver: hm won't do.. :) But it should be possible to configure HAL or something...
[07:45] <nameless`> nobody in vnc :(
[07:56] <fluid> no wxinwrap in 7.04 repositories? :(
[08:04] <Stig> antidrugue, yes, I'm reading it now thanks :)

[09:12] <Meshezabeel> lol, carlfk, people just selling them on a linux list. But it is in Canada :) I guess it would be closer to $12 american :)
[09:14] <talisein> Drk_Gu1: So, their file is really aimed at Red Hat. I'm having a tough time getting to the file ubuntu needs. So please give me some more time :)
[09:15] <ariks> heh, do i submit a bug to them about not being able to submit a big :)

[09:51] <PriceChild> sacater, ahhh I getcha :)
[09:54] <PriceChild> braveheartlionXP, openssh is basically a ssh server... don't worry about it. I suggest 32bit Ubuntu :)
[09:56] <keithg> OK fellows, I'm having some trouble here... I have my /home directory on a separate partition, and I've installed Feisty Fawn.  I'm having the problem with permissions and owners when trying to log in.  I've been googling for a solution, but I can't seem to find one.  I had this problem in the past and was able to get help here, so I'm here again.  :)  Any ideas?
[10:02] <fuzzy_logic> keithg: good luck :)
[10:05] <h4wk> ferret will do now :)
[10:08] <mlgx> antidrugue : right, wrong channel to say "Bonsoir" but I can speak english here, no problem :)

[10:28] <sphynx> antidrugue: I have it working while LiveCD session, but NetworkManager doesn't show it after installation :(
[10:28] <chernobylrpgfree> za: Good luck, and cheers :)

[none]	[00:19]	<Boumboum5>	agwells: I just did. used nautilus, unmounted my already mounted USB drive, re-mounted it, a new Nautilus window opens showing the USB's file contents. Works fine. might need to use nautilus to mount manually.

[none]	[00:20]	<flick>	which one offers most features out of ubuntu,kubuntu,xubuntu,edubuntu etc.?
[positive]	[00:21]	<Jordan_U>	Lifeisfunny, np :)
[none]	[00:21]	<ronald_>	kernel var .. /etc/sysconfig/kernel  ... en ubuntu ??
[none]	[00:21]	<Keule|on>	its a pitty....all the guys who are not ment... answering ...
[none]	[00:21]	<crdlb>	rbs-tito, it activates the ath_hal module
[none]	[00:21]	<akiratheoni>	@flick, you can just install ubuntu then install kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop
[none]	[00:21]	<schecky4>	jdong: yeah, the driver only fully supports 2D acceleration now
[none]	[00:21]	<agwells>	Boumboum5: and it had to be plugged in to from when i booted the OS
[none]	[00:21]	<crdlb>	but it's done automatically (so it just provides a way to diable it)
[none]	[00:21]	<jdong>	rbs-tito: unless you have a new AR53xx/54xx/5008x card, in which case you need madwifi from SVN
[none]	[00:21]	<saloxin>	Keule|on: you haven't show the error message?
[none]	[00:21]	<akiratheoni>	then you get all the features of ubuntu, kubuntu, and xubuntu
[none]	[00:21]	<Jordan_U>	flick, They all use the same repositories, it's just different default applications
[none]	[00:21]	<Ashfire908>	rbs-tito, if there is a restricted driver available, and needed, it will be in there.

[none]	[01:06]	<Generic>	anyone have awn running?
[positive]	[01:06]	<jnc>	earlmred: the best practice way I know is to have an ODBC connector on a windows box doing the access stuff, then connect that to a normal server's database like PostgreSQL or MySQL
[positive]	[01:06]	<Neatchee>	XP1: That means that NetworkManager is detecting the network as WEP incrypted, I believe.
[none]	[01:06]	<Ahorner>	whats command to mount?

[none]	[01:13]	<Neatchee>	I have a BCM4318 wireless chipset.  When using the bcm43xx restricted drivers, iwconfig reports a massive number of (ever increasing) Rx Invalid Crypt.   When using ndiswrapper, iwconfig reports a constantly increasing stream of Tx Excessive Retry and Invalid Misc.  I've been unable to find any bug reports or documentation about this problem. On another, possibly related note, when my Wii is on, I receive periodic disconnects every

[none]	[01:14]	<Colro>	ZionPsyfer: Well, whenever a program stops responding it turns black and white until it is active again for some reason -- I thought it was a feature. For some reason Firefox didn't return to normal when it stopped locking up, though.
[none]	[01:14]	<Neatchee>	Cryoniq: I know what you mean.  KDE feels like a toy compared to gnome, I think.  Gnome feels crisp, and KDE feels...like...bubbles.

[none]	[02:05]	<bqmassey>	what's that do stemount
[none]	[02:05]	<kkathman>	damn it why does xchat lose itself when you detach the channel panes
[none]	[02:05]	<scguy318>	Pirate_Hunter: if theres a proces taking a significant amount of memory, it will be at the top of the listing, otherwise its the kernel buffering in memory
[none]	[02:05]	<TorvusLinalds>	ahorner, metacity
[none]	[02:05]	<Wulong>	stemount: it doesn't help, it still wants to download the files.

[none]	[02:05]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: try kde see if it works better
[none]	[02:05]	<Kaitlyn2004>	In the package manager I wanted to install Amarok and then it wants to install a BUCNCH of things (i.e. KDE)... does Amarok not work w/ Gnome?

[none]	[02:05]	<stemount>	apt-get remove -f msttcorefonts
[none]	[02:05]	<scguy318>	Pirate_Hunter: and that buffering doesn't harm performance, just simple caching that will be yielded to programs that need

[none]	[02:05]	<stemount>	Amarok works with GNOME Kaitlyn2004
[none]	[02:05]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: or fglrx
[none]	[02:05]	<scguy318>	Kaitlyn2004: Amarok is a KDE app, therefore it needs the KDE libraries
[none]	[02:05]	<h1st0>	joanki: you create a seperate /home partition then you copy your current ~ there.  then you can tell it to mount that partition to /home.   That way if you ever reinstall you just tell the installer about your /home parition and it will keep you files and settings.
[none]	[02:05]	<seanieb64>	I cant get compiz to launch

[none]	[02:06]	<kevinp>	I downloaded the 7.10 release, and when I try to boot the CD it eventually drops to a busybox shell prompt. Anyone else seen this and know what is going on?

[none]	[02:06]	<scguy318>	Kaityln2004: the latter question if you want to
[none]	[02:06]	<stemount>	Wulong, do apt-get install msttcorefonts
[none]	[02:06]	<joanki>	but ummm... i think you said that i create my home, which i have
[none]	[02:06]	<TorvusLinalds>	so infuriating

[none]	[02:06]	<scguy318>	Kaityln2004: the KDE libs aren't serious overhead
[none]	[02:06]	<Kaitlyn2004>	scguy318: so what are my options?
[none]	[02:06]	<seanieb64>	Can anyone help me with my XGL prob?
[none]	[02:07]	<Arafangion>	luislo: Not my problem.
[none]	[02:07]	<TorvusLinalds>	should never have installed gutsy... buggy piece of c##p
[none]	[02:07]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: actually, use gnome
[none]	[02:07]	<Wulong>	stemount: it doesnt work, it halts in the install. It never gets more than 4% of the file.
[none]	[02:07]	<joanki>	but do i want to make sure to save all my files to home?
[none]	[02:07]	<scguy318>	Kaityln2004: you can use Amarok, or you can use other media players like mplayer, VLC, Rhythmbox, if you wish

[none]	[02:07]	<joanki>	ok
[none]	[02:07]	<mlalkaka>	katharos: wow just as an aside, we have surprisingly similar hardware: nvidia geforce fx 5200 and a sis 96x chipset.
[none]	[02:07]	<TorvusLinalds>	ahorner, then what are you saying
[none]	[02:07]	<JerseyMonkey>	Question: I'm having issues with the '-f' feature of rdesktop, could someone help me with it?

[none]	[02:07]	<Tstnz>	sorry
[none]	[02:07]	<Arafangion>	joanki: As a user, all your files are stored to your home directory, as ~/, which is a link to /home/joanki.
[positive]	[02:08]	<katharos>	mlalkaka: and yours works fine? so not fair! :P
[none]	[02:08]	<mlalkaka>	katharos: does the graphical interface start up at all?
[none]	[02:08]	<Wulong>	stemount: same thing happens with apt-get upgrade, it tries to install the package.

[none]	[02:08]	<joanki>	ohhh i see
[none]	[02:08]	<`eric->	should i format the drive in the livecd before i do the clean install?
[none]	[02:08]	<Ahorner>	go to
[none]	[02:08]	<stemount>	Wulong, have you added different sources?
[none]	[02:08]	<`eric->	would that make it easier?
[none]	[02:08]	<Wiseguy>	hey guys, for some reason whenever i play a long playlist of video, like multiple files in a playlist, from any media player (xine, totem, mplayer) to my tv-out, after a few hours the audio and video desync... does anyone know what causes this?
[none]	[02:08]	<CoasterMaster>	eric-, the installer will format for you

[none]	[02:08]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Though, if you use a database, or some other programs, then you might have data in /var
[none]	[02:08]	<`eric->	ok thanks
[none]	[02:08]	<joanki>	wooo i knew an answer haha
[none]	[02:08]	<Wulong>	stemount: no, it's a real source.
[none]	[02:08]	<katharos>	mlalkaka: i get the bulletproof X system, then it starts up in failsafe mode and i have a seriously dodgy resolution but it works
[none]	[02:08]	<joanki>	got it arafangion
[none]	[02:08]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: then the graphics card tab
[none]	[02:08]	<scguy318>	Kaitlyn2004: does that answer your question? anything else you need?
[none]	[02:08]	<joanki>	except i've got my other partition, my c drive
[none]	[02:09]	<joanki>	which i can save things to, too
[none]	[02:09]	<stemount>	do
[none]	[02:09]	<Neatchee>	Also, can anyone think of a reason why EAPOL negotiation between my Wii and my router would cause my ubuntu laptop to lose its connectivity to the internet for about 30 seconds?
[positive]	[02:09]	<Arafangion>	joanki: You can also write to /tmp, but that is by definition TeMPorary data. :)
[none]	[02:09]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: argh i dont think this is it
[none]	[02:09]	<joanki>	that's why 7.10 is good

[none]	[02:09]	<joanki>	it automaticaly gives you that thingie you need to do it
[none]	[02:09]	<kevinp>	I downloaded the 7.10 release, and when I try to boot the CD it eventually drops to a busybox shell prompt. Anyone else seen this and know what is going on?
[none]	[02:09]	<h1st0>	Neatchee: maybe if you only have so many dhcp leases availible?
[none]	[02:09]	<epidodi>	I just entered some commands from a feisty wiki in gutsy (hoping it would work). . .
[none]	[02:09]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: i dont know lol
[none]	[02:09]	<TorvusLinalds>	ahorner, i dont even have 'screen and graphics'
[none]	[02:09]	<scguy318>	Berzerker: weird, you might need to install the SSL packages, gnutls or something
[none]	[02:09]	<katharos>	mlalkaka: it also starts up fine if i set it to use the nv drivers instead of nvidia
[none]	[02:09]	<whonicca>	cafuego, how do i reverse chattr +i
[none]	[02:09]	<Berzerker>	I tried to

[none]	[02:09]	<stemount>	Neatchee, is the laptop a static ip?
[none]	[02:09]	<epidodi>	it did not - can someone tell me if I borked something by looking at the commands?
[none]	[02:09]	<Berzerker>	but the requirements both say no installation candidate
[none]	[02:09]	<joanki>	i've become a linux snob.... one that doesn't know how to use linux heh
[none]	[02:09]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Once you've learnt how to use gcc, I suggest you consider using an IDE, because you seem to like IDE's.
[none]	[02:10]	<Neatchee>	stemount: no, but it does have a reserved IP on the router, based on its MAC address
[positive]	[02:10]	<JerseyMonkey>	Question: Is there a 'explorer' I can use for Ubuntu beyond 'Ubuntu-desktop'? I dislike all the apps Ubuntu-desktop forces you to install.
[none]	[02:10]	<joanki>	i want to learn, arafangion
[none]	[02:10]	<Wulong>	stemount: bah, still the same. It wants to download whatever I do.
[none]	[02:10]	<Arafangion>	joanki: kdevelop is one such IDE.
[none]	[02:10]	<Ahorner>	TorvusLinalds: what version are you running
[none]	[02:10]	<joanki>	if im gonna be a programmer, i think i gotta learn
[none]	[02:10]	<TorvusLinalds>	i'll tell you why people use windows, cos it bloody WORKS unlike this gutsy rubbish which has almost bricked my computer
[none]	[02:10]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: like file manager?
[none]	[02:10]	<stemount>	are you sure there are no IP conflicts?
[positive]	[02:10]	<Neatchee>	h1st0: No, i have plenty of leases available :)
[none]	[02:10]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Yeah, you do.
[none]	[02:10]	<robert232323>	i need help!! i installed chipset and netgear drivers for my wireless usb, but when i plug it in it freezes my computer..what do i do?
[none]	[02:10]	<Berzerker>	you can't really brick a computer

[none]	[02:10]	<stemount>	what was the outcome of that command Wulong though
[none]	[02:10]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Please use my nick when you talk to me.

[positive]	[02:12]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Yup. :) It highlights if the name exists anywhere in the line.

[none]	[02:12]	<joanki>	Arafangion, yes, is xchat good i was gonna trry irssi
[none]	[02:12]	<katharos>	mlalkaka: but yeah, graphical interface
[none]	[02:12]	<JerseyMonkey>	scguy318: I removed a bunch of apps like Evolution, Xine, and a few others because I disliked the overwhelming amount of apps. When I removed 'tsclient' (terminal services client) Ubuntu-desktop got uninstalled. When I tried to go to 'Home Folder' or 'Computer' it never loads, most likely because Ubuntu-desktop is missing. I tried ot reinstall 'ubuntu-desktop' but it wants me to reinstall all the apps I just removed.

[none]	[02:13]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage that yields a Ubuntu desktop
[none]	[02:13]	<Berzerker>	so does anyone know the problem?
[none]	[02:13]	<joanki>	Arafangion, so you use it in terminal?

[none]	[02:13]	<profanephobia>	this whole time i thought i was in off-topic lol
[none]	[02:13]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: perhaps you removed nautilus somehow
[positive]	[02:13]	<Arafangion>	joanki: I run it on the server, and I just detach when I logout, and re-attach (ie, screen -rd) when I login. :) Yeah, in terminal.
[none]	[02:13]	<epidodi>	That worked in feisty - but not gutsy
[none]	[02:13]	<kevinp>	wirechief1: i did check the the checksum after download. The media will not check itself. It drops to a shell prompt.
[none]	[02:13]	<epidodi>	did I hurt something in gutsy by entering those?
[none]	[02:13]	<mlalkaka>	katharos: what happens if you start the program `glxgears`? what framerates are outputted in the console after while running the program?
[none]	[02:13]	<joanki>	Arafangion, isn't that horribly unuserfriendly?
[none]	[02:13]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: ubuntu-desktop is NOT required at all, it just simply depends on the stuff that the Ubuntu devs consider should be in a Ubuntu desktop
[positive]	[02:13]	<JerseyMonkey>	scguy318: What package do I need to add to bring back the functioning of my 'explorer'.
[none]	[02:13]	<kevinp>	wirechief1: forgot to mention, the checksum did match.
[none]	[02:13]	<Arafangion>	"joanki: No...  What do you mean by ""user friendly""?"
[none]	[02:13]	<joanki>	Arafangion, i tried to use it but it was so boring looking
[none]	[02:14]	<Ashfire908>	what signal do i send to fsck.ext3 to safely stop a bad block test?
[none]	[02:14]	<joanki>	Arafangion, not to mention it was such hard work to make anything WORK
[none]	[02:14]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: probably something like Nautilus, moment
[none]	[02:14]	<katharos>	"mlalkaka: Xlib:  extension ""GLX"" missing on display "":0.0"". Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual"
[none]	[02:14]	<Arafangion>	joanki: If the network dies, or I want to go somewhere else, I just go there, and log into my server, and my entire screen session continues to operate without even knowing about it.
[none]	[02:14]	<katharos>	mlalkaka: it worked fine when i was using nv
[positive]	[02:14]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: why the nautilus package :P
[none]	[02:14]	<scguy318>	JerseyMonkey: im betting thats probably it
[none]	[02:14]	<joanki>	oh
[none]	[02:14]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Linux is simply *different* to windows.
[none]	[02:14]	<epidodi>	the purpose of the commands was to redirect control alt delete to open gnome-system-tools
[none]	[02:15]	<joanki>	Arafangion, but you gotta be brainier to use linux and esp irssi
[none]	[02:15]	<joanki>	Arafangion, are you a programmer?
[none]	[02:15]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Nah, I disagree. Just gotta learn how to read documentation, such as 'man irssi'.
[none]	[02:15]	<JerseyMonkey>	scguy318: Package manager says Nautilus is installed, I am reinstalling it.

[none]	[02:15]	<xp_prg3>	if I have music coming out of my headphones, can I record this somehow into a wav file somehow easily in linux?
[none]	[02:15]	<mlalkaka>	katharos: i'm sure it did but it probably didn't have a very good framerate. the nv driver doesn't have 3d graphics acceleration support, so although its very stable, its no good for running fancy desktop effects and games. that's what the nvidia driver is for.
[none]	[02:15]	<Arafangion>	joanki: Why don't you learn how to program in Python before learning C?

[none]	[02:20]	<sco50000>	and there are 125 updates: 192MB in total
[none]	[02:20]	<joanki>	Arafangion, i see what you are saying but how is it possible??
[none]	[02:20]	<Arafangion>	"joanki: 'screen' is considered a linux ""killer app"", incidentially."
[none]	[02:20]	<Aquaeolian>	I should clarify: the hardware itself is okay.  The computer shut down in the middle of an upgrade, though, and I can't boot up because the software is not in a usable state.  I think my files should still be there, if I can only get to them.  My hard drive isn't mountable even in a Live CD...  I need some ideas for how to get my data before I reinstall the operating system.
[none]	[02:20]	<scguy318>	Berzerker: its libgnutls13

[none]	[02:21]	<scguy318>	Ashfire908: a simple kill pid, that would be SIGINT, may be it
[none]	[02:21]	<bruenig>	eugo, firefox does not follow the fhs, it therefore should be put in /opt, ubuntu for some reason tries to hack it up until it kind of fits into fhs but it still doesn't. So getting all the files in the right place to overwrite is tiresome and tedious. Just put it in /opt and launch it from there, much simpler.
[positive]	[02:21]	<stemount>	is the way forward :P

It seems like any game will do it -- Warcraft 3, HL mods, WoW, etc. It seems to happen fairly often, but at random times. I thought at first that it might be compiz fusion, but running with DISPLAY=:0 and WINEDEBUG=fixme-all doesn't fix it. I've tried emulating different versions of Windows and I've also tried several older versions of

[none]	[03:43]	<mrg>	rb2: wow. spiffy. well i'm glad the latest cards are supported.  that card is overkill for most tasks i'm sure.  mine is doing just fine so far for games and whatnot so i hate to spend cash just for incompatibility issues.

[none]	[03:55]	<jnc>	Tritonio: I'm glad my guess was helpful

[none]	[03:57]	<shane_>	I have a geforce 7600 I think
[none]	[03:57]	<IdleOne>	LordZack: what instructions are you following?
[none]	[03:57]	<Jimd1>	jban:  in your /etc/apt/sources.list file you should review it, remove the comment indicator the # symbol, from those, and then load synaptic package manager and choose reload.
[none]	[03:57]	<jnc>	BSG75: um, lol @ opening up new tabs.   that can't be fun
[none]	[03:57]	<Vlet>	Anick: I have an EVGA 8600 at work, and an EVGA 7600 at home - both worked with no tweaking
[none]	[03:57]	<marx2k>	ok I inserted the Ubuntu alternate CD into my laptop's drive while it's running Ubuntu... how do I get it to update to gutsy?
[none]	[03:57]	<Allenwr>	I am having problems with getting the driver to work.
[none]	[03:57]	<Lifeisfunny>	shane, I asked that question in compiz and they told me to go to gnome-look.org and dl a file cause emerald is out
[none]	[03:57]	<shane_>	ok, I have emerald
[positive]	[03:57]	<BSG75>	:jnc .. slightly confused as u can guess :)
[none]	[03:58]	<Anick>	Vlet: so after the install you could just enable the effects
[none]	[03:58]	<shane_>	but when I seleect a theme I see no way to make it go into effect
[none]	[03:58]	<chowmeined>	Anick: my other comp has a geforce fx5200 and it works great also..
[none]	[03:58]	<shane_>	I'll check gnome-look.org though
[none]	[03:58]	<charlie>	I have a quick question. Is it possible to change that brown color you see sometimes (like when GNOME is first starting, before the wallpaper comes on)?
[positive]	[03:58]	<Anick>	chowmeined: i'll have to try on my work pc it was a nvidia
[none]	[03:58]	<LordLimecat>	charlie: yes
[none]	[03:58]	<chowmeined>	Anick: yup.. just installed the driver from the restricted drivers manager.. then clicked the checkbox and they started working

[none]	[03:58]	<kevinO>	blayde yes, it still does not work, i think the problem begins with me installing ubuntu-desktop, over server edition, it still thinks it a server, thats why i think needed the normal headers or something, in grub it still says server too
[none]	[03:58]	<LordLimecat>	and change the color
[none]	[03:58]	<charlie>	Ah, I found it LordLimecat, thanks.

[positive]	[03:59]	<jnc>	BSG75: it's very explainable behavior, the scroll wheel is actually 3 buttons.  so you have 1 2 4 3 5  (left, right, scroll up, scroll click, scroll down)

[none]	[04:06]	<Adylass>	Hello, Gusty seems to use the XGL xorg server .. But my graphic card (on my laptop) is slow.. I would like to use the normal xorg server .. This can be done ?
[positive]	[04:06]	<bobgill>	"I have a bunch of .ttf fonts in a mounted partition, how do I move them all to /usr/share/fonts/truetype?  Would it be: ""sudo cp *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/truetype"" ?? Don't want to mess it up :)"
[positive]	[04:06]	<LordLimecat>	i mean, dont you sort of have to want a virus to get one on linux? (or be running wine) :)
[none]	[04:06]	<niuq>	eyemean: i have no support for my ati card?
[none]	[04:06]	<charlie>	Yes bobgill that is correct
[none]	[04:06]	<elliott_>	wirechief1: So I should just manually make a boot partition right at the beginning? How simple is that to do from the alternate install cd?
[none]	[04:06]	<pawan>	how to reintall ubuntu
[none]	[04:06]	<luislo>	Jimd1... I installed in default, which apparently is /usr/local/ would it be a config file there?
[none]	[04:06]	<Falstius>	Ademan_: alternatively you could use cron.  No one has probably made a standalone app for that because it is simple to do with commands that already exist.
[none]	[04:06]	<pawan>	reupgrade
[positive]	[04:06]	<eyemean>	niuq, im new to linux, but i found the following thread becuse i couldnt get desktop effects to work, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3530039
[none]	[04:06]	<Jimd1>	your config files are in yoru home folder
[none]	[04:06]	<IdleOne>	LordLimecat: you can download all the windows virii in the world it still wont affect linux
[none]	[04:07]	<charlie>	Pawan, do you say you want to upgrade from 7.04 Feisty to 7.10 Gusty?
[none]	[04:07]	<Jimd1>	luislo:  the ~ indicates your home folder
[none]	[04:07]	<pawan>	yes
[none]	[04:07]	<Jimd1>	luislo:  so if you are at the terminal window and you type cd ~ it will put you in your home folder
[none]	[04:07]	<ndan>	yea well theoretically if your not compiling from source and got a currupted .deb theoretically you could get a virus nay?  runnin an executible.  tho even if u did get one its not as bad as windows it has no admin rights....
[none]	[04:07]	<LordZack>	also my add/remove applications is stuck is their a task manager?
[none]	[04:07]	<LordLimecat>	IdleOne: as i understand it, some bot viruses actually DO run under wine
[none]	[04:07]	<eyemean>	niuq, like i said im new to linux, but it did work for me, i have ati 9550, so i enabled the restricated driver then installed the xserver-xgl component
[positive]	[04:07]	<bobgill>	charlie: thanks it worked :) :)
[none]	[04:07]	<LordLimecat>	i would imagine the would continue to run till killed

[none]	[04:07]	<melkor>	Im not sure how to turn on my bluetooth in gnome
[positive]	[04:08]	<IdleOne>	LordLimecat: well then if you get a virus under wine then perhaps you need not run wine :)
[none]	[04:08]	<luislo>	Jimd1, yes, I know, but I'm telling you that the default installation (according to the website and I just checked it) is in the /usr/local/ folder... would there also be a config file there?
[none]	[04:08]	<crazeej>	LordLimecat:  so the intel8x0 driver is the problem with my soundcard?
[none]	[04:08]	<niuq>	eyemean: i'll install that component it might work
[none]	[04:08]	<Falstius>	LordLimecat: linux machines certainly can, and are, hacked.  Don't think just because you run linux you can ignore all security worries.
[none]	[04:08]	<Jimd1>	luislo:  so, if you type cd ~/.config it will put you in the hidden folder called config which is located under your home folder
[none]	[04:08]	<fatcatmatt>	im gonna give 7.10 another shot.  if it doesn't work this time, then i will wait for updates to come out for it
[none]	[04:08]	<wirechief1>	elliott just use gparted but know what you are formating make sure its where you want it.
[none]	[04:08]	<LordLimecat>	crazeej: i BELIEVE so, although again, i have the same chipset and a creative audigy, and did not need to do that step
[none]	[04:08]	<charlie>	fatcatmatt: What problems were you having with 7.10?
[none]	[04:08]	<LordLimecat>	Falstius: i understand they can be hacked, but we're talkin viruses
[none]	[04:08]	<pawan>	how to manully upgrade
[none]	[04:09]	<crazeej>	LordLimecat:  well, i'll try it.. the module is in use apparently
[none]	[04:09]	<LordLimecat>	Falstius: i mean, generally, you arent going to get a virus until you get hacked, are ya? uinless youre REALLY uncareful?
[none]	[04:09]	<charlie>	pawan, Why do you want to manually upgrade? Do you not have an available internet connection on the machine you want upgraded?

[none]	[04:10]	<luislo>	Jimd1, I understand that... and I found the files... but my question is whether or not there will also be a configuration file in somewhere else, like in where the program was installed... which is the folder /usr/local
[none]	[04:10]	<LordLimecat>	but not viruses in the standard sense, since under linux you dont really need to dl all sorts of unknown apps--most are covered by default

[positive]	[04:15]	<Jimd1>	jban:  because you don't have permission.  you can't just double click on it and expect ot be able to edit it.  this isn't windows.  you need to think about how linux keeps you safe from yourself.

I did say to trust the connection and reboot but that did not help.
[none]	[04:16]	<charlie>	quittt, you can just download it and run it, no need to compile or install.

[none]	[04:17]	<jnc>	djlenoir: for $10 you can get a wired keyboard, to be very honest you may get this working eventually, but it's not likely to find support or other people who know how to fix it
[none]	[04:17]	<joanki>	or is it just cause i seem clueless haha
[none]	[04:17]	<charlie>	joanki, You may not know it, but Netscape 9 is actually a pretty good browser. It's based on Firefox, and is much more lightweight than previous Netscape versions.
[none]	[04:17]	<Jban>	Jimd1: Yep

[none]	[04:19]	<Jimd1>	jban:  that's just a text file in a folder.  easy to edit.  just need permissions to write it.  you should familiarize yourself with it.  when you add more third party sources they'll go there.

[none]	[04:20]	<seamus7>	m0u5e: I use the alt cd in order to have greater partitioning control when setting my dual boot up
[none]	[04:20]	<charlie>	m0u5e, Nope, your best bet would be the standard Live CD
[none]	[04:20]	<Jban>	Jimd1: I understand that concept now.

[positive]	[04:21]	<djlenoir>	jnc: i appreciate the candid advice. i would just go that route but my gaming pc is already set up with wired keyboard and mouse so i need to be able to use this bluetooth keyboard and mouse so that i can stash them out of the way when not in use. i am pretty sure it can work, i am just not experienced enough with *nix to know how to troubleshoot it properly. most of what i have done has been the result of a ton of reading and tinkering.

[none]	[05:42]	<bruenig>	bobgill, *nix apps share libraries, the mindset needs to shift to understand that

[positive]	[05:42]	<secret901>	krammer: in my experience it's much worse than Feisty
[none]	[05:42]	<MaTrIx-X>	anyone have good suggestions for Gutsy repositories? (aside what comes preset)
[none]	[05:42]	<stan_ley>	not if u cant catch wats going on
[none]	[05:42]	<secret901>	krammer: a lot of things are broken
[none]	[05:42]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, what are you trying to do? mount vfat with user perms to write/read?
[none]	[05:42]	<Dan2552>	lpMoo: isn't it giving you a headache trying to keep up with it all?
[positive]	[05:42]	<marx2k>	actually it looks like if you drop to a terminal in the Ubuntu install CD, gparted is installed... you just need to be able to run it :)
[none]	[05:42]	<crdlb>	derrrface, save and close, then try compiz --replace again
[none]	[05:43]	<kyleBAKED>	jimmygoon, yes sir
[none]	[05:43]	<bobgill>	I have libdvdcss2 as well, still no luck
[none]	[05:43]	<nickrud>	jimmygoon: on an external automount
[none]	[05:43]	<marx2k>	meaning you just have to know to run it
[none]	[05:43]	<jimmygoon>	... nickrud that should be default, no?
[positive]	[05:43]	<marx2k>	Im running gparted within the Ubuntu install CD right now :)
[none]	[05:43]	<KevinO>	can i delete my networking/interfaces cinfig and generate a new one?
[none]	[05:43]	<KevinO>	config*
[none]	[05:43]	<IpMoo>	Dan2552,   its a little slow  auctualy  and the server should eplay data  flow.. so's to smooth out the  chatt
[positive]	[05:43]	<youknowme>	gouranga, oh.. you want me to explain it again? or..
[none]	[05:43]	<_tux>	bobgill, you tried installing vlc?
[none]	[05:43]	<jimmygoon>	I know the mount options on a single mount command that work... but I have no idea how to configure automount magic
[none]	[05:43]	<nickrud>	jimmygoon: I would hope so, but don't know. Don't have one to check
[none]	[05:43]	<bobgill>	_tux: it is installed
[none]	[05:44]	<secret901>	if Gutsy doesn't even work in a an officially supported Dell Linux computer, I doubt it will work in other places.
[none]	[05:44]	<_tux>	not working eh
[none]	[05:44]	<jimmygoon>	nickrud, well, mine all do... something is messed up probably
[none]	[05:44]	<merula_>	_tux: okay, so I read through the troubleshooting page -- no help
[none]	[05:44]	<kyleBAKED>	it is mounted with vfat defaults 0 1

[none]	[05:44]	<robbizzle>	ok im back for my first question
[none]	[05:44]	<nickrud>	jimmygoon: kyleBAKED 's talking about allowing all users, not just the live X session
[none]	[05:44]	<derrrface>	crdlb: same response
[none]	[05:44]	<robbizzle>	don't have a dvd drive on my laptop, can I do a network install from my other pc?
[none]	[05:44]	<IpMoo>	Dan2552,   thats why i suggest they use data flow control
[none]	[05:44]	<crdlb>	derrrface, try rebooting
[none]	[05:44]	<kyleBAKED>	well, i only have one user account, i just said all for sake of typing
[none]	[05:45]	<IpMoo>	so the screen aint always  jumping
[none]	[05:45]	<derrrface>	crdlb: ok
[none]	[05:45]	<stan_ley>	<jba> how are headset connected ? on speakers ?
[none]	[05:45]	<`eric->	i can't get any themes to install.. they never show up in the list.. no errors or anything.. the menus get all funky and stuff... but the window style doesn't really change.. i can change to any of the default themese though.. any ideas?
[none]	[05:45]	<Jban>	stan_ley: USB
[none]	[05:45]	<_tux>	merula, Don't know what to say man seems like the driver isn't enabled for compiz fusion or its something else
[none]	[05:45]	<Jban>	Logitech 350
[none]	[05:45]	<Dan2552>	'eric-: I'm getting teh same thing on a theme I just made, i thought i was making it wrong
[none]	[05:45]	<jimmygoon>	nickrud, ah, well, maybe this can still help. this is what I use w/ truecrypt so that my users can edit a mounted partition that is encrypted file: -o gid=100,uid=1000,umask=000
[none]	[05:45]	<IpMoo>	Dan2552,   and u should filter out some of the chatt anyhow
[positive]	[05:45]	<IpMoo>	:)
[none]	[05:45]	<MaTrIx-X>	I need some assistance with iscsitarget on Gutsy/amd64 if anyone is willing to help --- I've Googled til nothings left, posted on forums with no response, and I've been trying to get this working for the 2nd day straight
[none]	[05:45]	<Dan2552>	lpMoo: I'm using opera, no idea if it can even do that
[none]	[05:45]	<merula_>	_tux: alrighty thanks for the help at least.
[none]	[05:45]	<riotkittie>	uhm. secret901, something tells me that this officially  supported Dell Linux cp wasn't bought with gutsy preinstalled, nor did anyone guarentee that it would work with gutsy. but getting it to do so shouldnt be the end of the world. i have it running fine on a dell laptop and dell desktop, both made long before dell started selling boxes with  ubuntu preinstalled
[none]	[05:45]	<`eric->	Dan2552: did you fix it?
[none]	[05:45]	<_tux>	merula, sorry bro
[none]	[05:46]	<gouranga>	youknowme, no thank you.  I've ubuntu on this extra PC for a while because I'bve heard a lot about it.  But I can't seem to configure it, although I find no problem with my slackware and gentoo computers.  I must be looking at it wrong.
[none]	[05:46]	<robbizzle>	can I message someone or can you message me  to help me out on my first install?
[none]	[05:46]	<Vlet>	`eric-: if you click 'customize' on a theme, you can pick what you installed... the 'themes' you install are different from the themes in the list. the themes you install are themes for either window borders, or controls or icons, etc
[none]	[05:46]	<kyleBAKED>	jimmygoon, do i append that to the end of my fstab entry?
[none]	[05:46]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, in that case, it really ought to work out of box, let me plug in my drive and see what it mounts with
[none]	[05:46]	<Dan2552>	`eric-: no, thats why i actually came here but no one replied
[none]	[05:46]	<KevinO>	 can anyone help me with configuring my network, I had it set to dhcp, then i needed to set it to static, then i tried to restart the network, and it says SIOCADDRT no such process / Falied to bring up eth0, i try to set it back to dhcp and it says the same thing
[none]	[05:46]	<marx2k>	wow... Gutsy hates NVidia it seems
[none]	[05:46]	<stan_ley>	jban: audio port ?
[negative]	[05:46]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, you shouldn't have to :S
[none]	[05:46]	<_tux>	bobgill, try installing mplayer if that doesn't work you may need specific codecs like an GStreamer codec
[none]	[05:46]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, let me see what happens when i plug mine in
[none]	[05:46]	<djlenoir>	anyone have one of the ubuntu dell computers? what dvd software is included on those?
[positive]	[05:46]	<nickrud>	jimmygoon: good for the terminal or fstab ;) kyleBAKED you might try adding that to the mount options of the volume tab when you right click the icon on the desktop (look for the triagle near the bottom)
[none]	[05:46]	<secret901>	riotkittie: that's right, that's why I should have stuck with Feisty.  It was working perfectly.
[none]	[05:46]	<Vlet>	marx2k: did you upgrade or install?
[none]	[05:46]	<IpMoo>	marx2k,   im wondering about that caus e all i see  is that  issue

[none]	[05:47]	<crdlb>	marx2k, did you use envy at any point?
[none]	[05:47]	<youknowme>	gouranga, ok then, I hope you figure it out somewhere along the line lol. Either way, I'm off to bed, good luck!
[negative]	[05:47]	<robbizzle>	please help :'(
[none]	[05:47]	<pavs>	exit
[none]	[05:47]	<Dan2552>	`eric-: it would be good to know that its not my theme breaking things... I spent quite a while on it, also being my 1st theme
[none]	[05:47]	<marx2k>	crdlb: *hangs head* yes
[none]	[05:47]	<Vlet>	marx2k: yeah, it didn't like mine after upgrading, but after installing, it was seamless
[none]	[05:47]	<kyleBAKED>	jimmygoon, nickrud, it is in my fstab as /dev/sdb1 /media/disk vfat defaults 0 1

[none]	[05:48]	<marx2k>	(and unfortunately wiping a  lot of precious info)
[none]	[05:48]	<secret901>	riotkittie: 1. It's not suspending/hibernating correctly, and 2. the wireless connection stops working after a resume from suspend (if it actually resume at all)
[none]	[05:48]	<Dan2552>	robbizzle: about what?
[none]	[05:48]	<tritium>	crdlb: envy is the breaking element
[negative]	[05:48]	<nickrud>	kyleBAKED: a sec,

[none]	[05:48]	<Rich4>	I'm having trouble in 7.1
[none]	[05:48]	<robbizzle>	I have never used or installed ubuntu
[none]	[05:48]	<jimmygoon>	marx2k, then backup your data. use a live disc and mount your hd
[none]	[05:48]	<scguy318>	mark2k: you shouldnt have to wipe all that precious info, you can just backup
[none]	[05:48]	<kyleBAKED>	okay, so remove that from fstab and let it mount automatically?
[none]	[05:48]	<crdlb>	tritium, I hate it more than I hate automatix
[none]	[05:48]	<robbizzle>	but I have no DVD drive on laptop
[none]	[05:48]	<Dan2552>	robbizzle: this is my 1st time, but maybe i can help you
[none]	[05:48]	<jimmygoon>	marx2k, or better yet, just reset your xorg.conf... its not hard to do

[none]	[05:48]	<Allenwr>	hey, I need some help
[none]	[05:49]	<Vlet>	robbizzle: so get the CD

[none]	[05:49]	<jimmygoon>	marx2k, network?
[none]	[05:49]	<MoLerner>	so what would cause ubuntu not to be able to connect to a wireless network that's easily in range? it can detect the networks, but for secured networks it just asks for the pass over and over again (even though it's right), and for unsecured networks it just tries forever to connect
[negative]	[05:49]	<marx2k>	too late now anyway, the disc is formatted :(
[negative]	[05:49]	<robbizzle>	dan22552:can I do a network install?

[none]	[05:49]	<jimmygoon>	marx2k, did you do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver?
[none]	[05:49]	<marx2k>	yup
[none]	[05:49]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, yeah... try that
[positive]	[05:49]	<m0u5e>	so i just installed gutsy, but planning on using easyBCD i did not install the grub bootloader... how do i boot gutsy using BCD w/out grub (is it even possible? -_-;)
[negative]	[05:49]	<nickrud>	kyleBAKED: if this is an external that gets plugged and unplugged, try commenting out that line, the automounting should do it for you
[none]	[05:49]	<Dan2552>	robbizzle: good question, no idea
[none]	[05:49]	<marx2k>	and it still didnt work which is what bewildered me
[none]	[05:49]	<jimmygoon>	marx2k, eek
[none]	[05:49]	<kyleBAKED>	alright, i will try that

[none]	[05:50]	<DanaG>	Oh hey, when will Hardy be worth bothering with?
[none]	[05:51]	<jumbers>	riotkittie: I know it doesn't exist in gutsy, but where can I download it from? I need it since a majority of my music collection is in FLAC
[negative]	[05:51]	<jimmygoon>	Rich4 it will never die!, but sadly, I don't know how to stop that :S
[none]	[05:51]	<riotkittie>	m0u5e: you can install GRUB  from a live disc if you have one

[none]	[05:51]	<Dan2552>	m0u5e: can't you access the grub config file from live cd?
[none]	[05:51]	<jimmygoon>	Kevin0, what is wrong with it?
[none]	[05:51]	<c_lisp>	mouze you can download grub and burn it on a cd to reinstall it
[positive]	[05:51]	<m0u5e>	punsad: .......
[none]	[05:51]	<stan_ley>	jban: check settings in alsamixer, make sure there all on
[negative]	[05:51]	<jimmygoon>	Kevin0, plug in the wire :S
[negative]	[05:51]	<Rich4>	jimmygoon: so we need to wait this out? :(
[none]	[05:51]	<jimmygoon>	DanaG, 5-6 months from now
[none]	[05:51]	<marx2k>	I suggest Super Grub Rescue Disc
[none]	[05:51]	<kyleBAKED>	ok cool, just letting it do its own thing works
[none]	[05:51]	<m0u5e>	c_lisp: is it possible to boot into gutsy w/out grub by using the EASYBCD vista bootloader?
[none]	[05:52]	<jimmygoon>	Rich4, did you install amarok manually?
[none]	[05:52]	<Jban>	stan_ley: But I want the sound to come through my USB headset, so why not have USB selected?
[none]	[05:52]	<kyleBAKED>	is there a way to remove the desktop icon for the drive though?
[none]	[05:52]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, good. yes
[none]	[05:52]	<riotkittie>	jumbers: try googling  >|
[none]	[05:52]	<MoLerner>	does anyone else see madly psychadelic vertical colored lines when restarting ubuntu?
[none]	[05:52]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, gconf-editor
[none]	[05:52]	<c_lisp>	mou5e im not sure never heard of easybcd
[none]	[05:52]	<Rich4>	I updated feisty to 7.1
[none]	[05:52]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon:  i tried to configure ot for static and then restart, it says SIOCADDRT: No such process/ Failed to bring up eth0
[negative]	[05:52]	<nickrud>	kyleBAKED: don't mount it to /media
[positive]	[05:52]	<jimmygoon>	kyleBAKED, its in there somewhere :P
[none]	[05:52]	<marx2k>	MoLerner, only when I drop acid
[none]	[05:52]	<m0u5e>	c_lisp: its a utility for windows which allows you to edit the windows bootloader BCD
[none]	[05:52]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: now i cannot even get it set back to dhcp
[none]	[05:52]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, did you manually configure it for static or did you use the gnome-networking tool?
[none]	[05:52]	<Dan2552>	c_lisp: are you the same c_lisp on my msn? (sorry for offtopic)
[none]	[05:52]	<Rich4>	goon: updated fawn 7.04 to 7.1

[none]	[05:53]	<MoLerner>	what about not being able to connect to a wifi network that is easily connectable in windows?
[negative]	[05:53]	<nickrud>	kyleBAKED: gconf-editor will turn off showing all devices in /media, like usb sticks. Better to choose something like /vfat or /external-windows-crap for the mountpoint
[none]	[05:53]	<DanaG>	I know Hardy is rather early -- where do things start?
[none]	[05:53]	<secret901>	anyone having trouble resuming from a suspend on a laptop in Feisty?
[none]	[05:53]	<punsad>	m0u5e: I don't think so.  You need some sort of linux bootloader.  EasyBCD is just a front end to edit the boot config for vista
[none]	[05:53]	<jimmygoon>	Rich4, and you had install amarok manually? its liekly some fluke of your system . maybe uninstall/reinstall amarok?

[none]	[05:55]	<punsad>	m0u5e: I'm trying to remember how I set it up
[none]	[05:55]	<m0u5e>	will super grub allow me to restore grub to a partition and not overwrite the vista BCD bootloader?
[none]	[05:55]	<Vlet>	secret901: that doesn't make much sense.. kubuntu-desktop is part of kubuntu

[none]	[05:56]	<secret901>	Vlet: I think it's what's causing all the headaches I'm having with Gutsy
[none]	[05:56]	<nickrud>	tux97: use the alternate install cd, and simply insert it. However, if you have any apps installed that aren't on the cd, it'll get them from the net

[none]	[05:56]	<Rich4>	how do i revert back to feisty fawn?
[none]	[05:56]	<marx2k>	basically for emulation
[none]	[05:56]	<DShepherd>	cause i found the solution on the launchpad

[none]	[05:57]	<_SlaK_>	hello
[none]	[05:57]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: ah right, my PS2 controller (+usb) has been unused for about a year
[positive]	[05:57]	<m0u5e>	nickrud: wait, can i use the ubuntu gutsy cd to reinstall grub?
[none]	[05:57]	<secret901>	Vlet: I ran that and it said that it's not installed.  But I still have a ton of KDE-specific apps around
[none]	[05:57]	<riotkittie>	jumbers: i cannot play them in XMMS. i can play them in audacious [which you should install as XMMS is deprecated, anyway]. If you can not immediately play them in audacious, try installing the audacious-plugins package
[none]	[05:57]	<_SlaK_>	how can I enter other severs?
[none]	[05:57]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, where we getting some libxml2 error thingy the other night while trying to assist me?
[positive]	[05:57]	<m0u5e>	nickrud: if i don't have it installed on ubuntu yet, can i use it to install grub on my new installed partition?
[negative]	[05:57]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, or try going to http://64.233.169.104 in firefox and see if anything comes up
[none]	[05:57]	<nickrud>	!grub | m0u5e this has instructions
[negative]	[05:57]	<ubotu>	m0u5e this has instructions: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[none]	[05:57]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: i cannot ping that address the first thiing i noticed that was weird is that the computer im on now has a gateway of 192.168.1.1, but my router is 192.168.0.1
[none]	[05:57]	<marx2k>	Dan2552: Yeah.. when I plug it into my linux box, it crashes the box! no joke
[positive]	[05:57]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: I don't think I'll ever forget it
[none]	[05:57]	<riotkittie>	jumbers: audacious is similar to XMMS but is still being actively worked on
[none]	[05:58]	<jimmygoon>	Kevin0 is that pc plugged directly into the router?
[none]	[05:58]	<J-_>	Can I use the epiphany sidebar to put bookmarks in via epilicious?
[none]	[05:58]	<ctothej>	after the upgrade to gutsy, my computer is slow... what is going on?
[none]	[05:58]	<dystopianray>	amarok is the best
[none]	[05:58]	<jimmygoon>	Kevin0, one ethernet card only?
[positive]	[05:58]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: heh. Unlucky I guess. I'd advise getting bluetooth and a wii mote ;)
[none]	[05:58]	<marx2k>	so thats why Im wondering if the new updated kernel supports it now
[none]	[05:58]	<captlloyd>	I have the amd64 gutsy ISO downloaded, I would like to upgrade from feisty from that ISO.  There is no cdromupgrade script in the ISO. when I do an apt-get dist-upgrade it just tells me there are no packages to upgrade. If run update manager it will allow me to do the upgrade over the net. I do have the ISO mounted and is in my sources.list
[none]	[05:58]	<akincer>	or just download super grub and fix it immediately
[negative]	[05:58]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/+bug/151045 & https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/+bug/151045/comments/ - that solve the libxml2 error
[none]	[05:58]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: and the pc having the problems wont work on any gateway setting
[none]	[05:58]	<jumbers>	riotkittie: Is it somewhat minimalistic like XMMS? Because I don't want to deal with full screen interfaces and whatnot
[none]	[05:58]	<marx2k>	Dan2552: Thats $$$$
[positive]	[05:58]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: not one of my most happy experiences. Things ok now?
[none]	[05:58]	<Vlet>	secret901: you could try apt-get autoremove
[none]	[05:58]	<secret901>	ctothej: it's probably using the fancy compiz effects
[none]	[05:58]	<tux97>	so log out of my username and then login to root and i should be fine to upgrade?
[none]	[05:58]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: yes they are both plugged into the router
[none]	[05:58]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: but its good $$$
[none]	[05:58]	<secret901>	Vlet: tried that, there's nothing to uninstall
[none]	[05:58]	<marx2k>	I might just USB-hack my extra xbox controllers
[none]	[05:58]	<riotkittie>	jumbers: yes. it's nearly identical to xmms.
[none]	[05:58]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, are you specifying those gateway settings?
[none]	[05:58]	<stan_ley>	jban: in terminal [ sudo lsusb -v | grep iProduct ] it tells the products, if the headphones are there, then it is alsamixer
[none]	[05:58]	<ctothej>	secret901: no compiz effect here
[none]	[05:58]	<jumbers>	riotkittie: Oh, fantastic
[none]	[05:59]	<punsad>	mouse: what os'es are insdtalled on the box alread?
[none]	[05:59]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, well after a reinstall and installation of some programs I got into some problems. Not sure why.
[none]	[05:59]	<MoLerner>	"""The Composite extension is not available"" what does that mean?"
[none]	[05:59]	<J-_>	my usb hacked xbox controller works wonders.
[none]	[05:59]	<Jban>	stan_ley: type in what exactly, can you put everything in (  )
[none]	[05:59]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: a wii mote controlled media center would be perfect
[none]	[05:59]	<secret901>	ctothej: System->Preferences->appearance
[positive]	[05:59]	<marx2k>	Dan2552: Yeah itd be even better if I had a WII :)
[none]	[05:59]	<secret901>	ctothej: make sure it's not enabled
[positive]	[05:59]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: automatix ?!
[none]	[05:59]	<riotkittie>	J-_: congrats
[positive]	[05:59]	<marx2k>	Right now my modded xbox serves as a media center via XBMC - does 1080i and everything :)
[none]	[05:59]	<stan_ley>	jban: follow me to #stan
[none]	[06:00]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, nope. i dont use that thing. never did. never will
[none]	[06:00]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: the pc with problems has eth0 and eth1 (gigabyte) neither of them work, yes i specified the gateway settings.
[none]	[06:00]	<Vlet>	secret901: not sure then
[none]	[06:00]	<poter_h>	hi
[none]	[06:00]	<c_lisp>	marx2k I love smbing to my xbmc!1
[none]	[06:00]	<akincer>	Anyone else find the Screens and Graphics utility as worthless as I have with an Nvidia chipset?
[none]	[06:00]	<johnchia>	marx2k: how does it handle 1080i?
[none]	[06:00]	<bo2>	is there an alternative irc client
[positive]	[06:00]	<c_lisp>	:P
[positive]	[06:00]	<J-_>	riotkittie: hmm I guess... =)
[none]	[06:00]	<bo2>	something thats similar to mirc
[none]	[06:00]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: you complain about $$$ yet you have HD
[none]	[06:00]	<riotkittie>	bo2: alternative to what?
[none]	[06:00]	<marx2k>	john,  very nicely
[negative]	[06:00]	<c_lisp>	I can't get mugen to work on my xbox :(
[positive]	[06:00]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: hm, odd you had something in local then. Never woulda thought of that.
[none]	[06:00]	<marx2k>	Dan2552, dude, the HD is WHY I have no $$$
[none]	[06:00]	<jscinoz>	"Hey guys, i dont know what i did but i can nolonger use SSH, i type the command, and nothing happens, if i type it with the verbose flag it says ""ssh: hostnamehere: name or service not known"" it does this for any server, how can i fix this?"
[none]	[06:00]	<riotkittie>	bo2: oh. uhmmm xchat's probably the closest thing.
[none]	[06:00]	<secret901>	bo2: you can use xchat or Pidgin
[none]	[06:00]	<punsad>	m0u5e: I think it will all work if you install ubuntu last
[none]	[06:00]	<marx2k>	c_lisp: indeed! I just wish I could figure out how to get the emulators to SMB roms into it
[none]	[06:00]	<ctothej>	secret901: was set to 'none'
[none]	[06:00]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, um... if you set it to dhcp ... then it shouldn't even let you put in a gateway address
[positive]	[06:00]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: haha. Well it's not like wii is uber expensive
[positive]	[06:00]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: but I wish I had
[none]	[06:01]	<stan_ley>	jban: in this window type ( /j stan)
[none]	[06:01]	<KevinO>	jscinoz:  you have to use something like ssh user@IP
[none]	[06:01]	<Lilacor>	where can I find more information about using KVM + Gutsy? I am not too keen on KVM's syntax....

[none]	[06:01]	<marx2k>	(And an XBox 360)
[none]	[06:01]	<andersbr>	jscinoz: Sounds like a wider networking problem.  Can you ssh by IP address?
[positive]	[06:01]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: about the only way would be if you compiled something
[none]	[06:01]	<c_lisp>	marx2k I don't think you can smb roms on it you have to put them ont he harddrive
[none]	[06:01]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: no your right, im saying that i specify when i tried static
[positive]	[06:01]	<scguy318>	riotkittie: its not really that hard :P
[none]	[06:01]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, it said the files were install 19 of Oct and 10 am. something put it there..

[none]	[06:01]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: you know, you probably paid more on that than i've earned in my entire life
[none]	[06:01]	<marx2k>	c_lisp yeah I hate that... even though the emulators HAVE an smb option
[none]	[06:01]	<bo2>	does ubuntu require firewalls and av to stay safe

[none]	[06:02]	<marx2k>	Dan2552, believe me, I feel the pinch
[positive]	[06:02]	<c_lisp>	killer intinct would of been nice with net play :P
[none]	[06:02]	<bo2>	online shopping shouldnt be a problem?
[none]	[06:02]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, i dont think so either
[none]	[06:02]	<scguy318>	!firewall | bo2
[negative]	[06:02]	<ubotu>	bo2: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

[positive]	[06:02]	<marx2k>	but since I haxx0r'd DishNET, my girlfriend loves me more now :) :)
[none]	[06:02]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, could be one of those i guess
[none]	[06:02]	<punsad>	for newbies, it's a good idea
[none]	[06:02]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, I know the restart seems silly but gnome needs it sometimes, I'm convinced
[positive]	[06:03]	<Dan2552>	marx2k: maybe its best not to get a wii, dont want to go throwing wii motes at the screen :p
[positive]	[06:03]	<nickrud>	DShepherd: could be that. Using non-standard install locations is a hallmark of bad packaging
[none]	[06:03]	<bo2>	umm

[none]	[06:03]	<secret901>	jscinoz: if it's already installed, uninstalling and reinstalling might do the trick
[none]	[06:03]	<bo2>	what does it mean to serve a windows client

[none]	[06:05]	<jscinoz>	c_lisp how do you mod a 360 and not get banned from XBL? are there stealth mods now?
[none]	[06:05]	<c_lisp>	u can get games from ps2cat
[none]	[06:05]	<DShepherd>	nickrud, if we had identifed that i guess my upgrade would have gone thru fine. oh well you live and you learn
[none]	[06:05]	<jimmygoon>	riotkittie, thats why you use virtualbox or pirate vmware workstation.. I didn't liek the server one but workstation is okay
[none]	[06:05]	<c_lisp>	jscinoz yea
[none]	[06:05]	<captlloyd>	dystopianray: so how do I upgrade to to gutsy? I have the ISO mounted and added as a package source
[none]	[06:05]	<simplyubuntu>	has anyone here ussed the alternate install cd to install??
[none]	[06:05]	<bo2>	brb for reboot
[positive]	[06:05]	<jscinoz>	all they need now is a firmware downgrade to the exploited one
[positive]	[06:05]	<marx2k>	I have unlimited bandwidth/download from a gigantic newsfeed :D
[none]	[06:05]	<dystopianray>	riotkittie: virtualbox is very good and is in the gutsy repos
[positive]	[06:05]	<dystopianray>	captlloyd: you can't upgrade with only the cd
[none]	[06:06]	<jimmygoon>	riotkittie, and I have it set up to where I can dual boot or use the vmware for the same copy .. you have to be careful when setting it up though, if you accidently boot linux while its running in the vm or w/e, you get major... majoor problems
[positive]	[06:06]	<jscinoz>	hmm we have an ubuntu for ps3, we need an ubuntu for 360 :P
[none]	[06:06]	<punsad>	a well configured windows box shouldn't have problems with spyware.  If you aren't savvy enough to keep spyware of your windows box, you *might* find some challenges every now and then if you become an exclusive linux user

[none]	[06:06]	<nickrud>	!offtopic
[none]	[06:06]	<ubotu>	#ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[none]	[06:06]	<jscinoz>	Dan2552, but no one has found a way to run arbitary code on the wii yet
[none]	[06:06]	<jscinoz>	c_lisp, yeah, no 3d accel, and only acess to 1 of 8 cores i think
[none]	[06:07]	<captlloyd>	dystopianray: Ahh, is there a way I can make it download the packages from the CD so I don't have to download 900MB?  If i have it added as a source and start the upgrade from update-manager, will it get the packages from there?
[none]	[06:07]	<Dan2552>	jscinoz: I don't see why though, they have the warez running on it
[none]	[06:07]	<c_lisp>	yea Modded Xbox 360 Premium w/ Stealth I-Xtreme 1.2 + 6
[none]	[06:07]	<jscinoz>	damn hypervisor shit
[none]	[06:07]	<riotkittie>	i'll look into virtualbox. thanks dystopianray and jimmygoon.
[none]	[06:07]	<dystopianray>	jscinoz: 7 of 8 SPEs
[none]	[06:07]	<jimmygoon>	jscinoz, ubuntu on 360 has already been done...
[none]	[06:07]	<jscinoz>	dan2552, you mean pirated discs?
[none]	[06:07]	<simplyubuntu>	i need to know why the upgrade wants to download files even though i said not to! help!
[none]	[06:07]	<Dan2552>	yes
[none]	[06:07]	<dystopianray>	riotkittie: virtualbox is open source as well, i highly recomend it
[none]	[06:07]	<jscinoz>	jimmygoon, O_o just use the PPC disk? or a special kernel?
[none]	[06:07]	<jimmygoon>	jscinoz, just with the old kernel version, but they have some interesting new developments on various fronts
[none]	[06:07]	<c_lisp>	my free does them and sell them no sell.com buster
[none]	[06:07]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: because you have apps that require stuff that's not on the cd
[none]	[06:07]	<secret901>	simplyubuntu: are you using an alternate install disk?
[none]	[06:07]	<marx2k>	c-lisp: do you have a dual layer burner or something?
[positive]	[06:07]	<dystopianray>	captlloyd: i'm not sure
[none]	[06:07]	<jimmygoon>	jscinoz, its a very large process, not officially supported by ms or anyone

[none]	[06:08]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon:  and shouldnt my gateways match?
[none]	[06:08]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, if you don't mind me asking why do you need static?
[none]	[06:08]	<MSTK>	is there a special channel for help with Gutsy upgrades?
[none]	[06:08]	<BlackCow>	so im really scratching my head here, im trying to install teamspeak server, I created a new user called teamspeak and set a password, i type su teamspeak and give the correct password but it dosnt do anything, what could be going wrong
[none]	[06:08]	<nickrud>	Dan2552: lol, no, probably aren't even any hardy repos filled yet. Wait a month

[positive]	[06:11]	<djlenoir>	oh sweet! i finally stumbled upon a forum thread that gave me the answer i needed to get my bluetooth keyboard and mouse working... even after a reboot! = happiness! :)
[none]	[06:11]	<scguy318>	jimmygoon: isn't that old news?
[none]	[06:11]	<DanaG>	I did the sed command and updated (not upgrade), and I see lots of gcc updates.
[none]	[06:12]	<jimmygoon>	scguy318, yes?
[none]	[06:12]	<nickrud>	DanaG: they must be planning a new toolchain for the lts
[none]	[06:12]	<jimmygoon>	Kevin0, either way, if you really want static, the gateway ip = router ip... the ip address should be just like the router except the last part should be a number between 2-200 and the other one is 255.255.255.0
[none]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	"Kevin0, the best thing to do is to run ""ifconfig eth0"" in a terminal, and copy the info out of there to fill in the boxes for the static ip"
[none]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, then you are using settings that you know shoudl work
[none]	[06:13]	<rayb0t>	some routers let you assign IP addresses to MAC addresses, which is kinda convenient sometimes
[none]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	rayb0t, most do it behind the scenes anyway
[none]	[06:13]	<MSTK>	thanks...switching to metacity seems to work
[none]	[06:13]	<MSTK>	but how do I get beryl back, now?
[none]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	my laptop always gets .76, etc
[none]	[06:13]	<MSTK>	has the process changed since Fiesty?
[none]	[06:14]	<djlenoir>	now a simple question... how do you delete an icon that is left over in the Applications --> Internet menu list after the program was removed?
[none]	[06:14]	<jscinoz>	damn aussie isps
[none]	[06:14]	<_blitz_>	checking whether gcc accepts -g... yes
[none]	[06:14]	<jimmygoon>	MSTK, um since its install by default, yes
[none]	[06:14]	<_blitz_>	checking for c++... no
[none]	[06:14]	<_blitz_>	checking for g++... no
[none]	[06:14]	<_blitz_>	checking for gcc... gcc

[none]	[06:14]	<jimmygoon>	"MSTK, ""compiz --replace"" should work though"
[none]	[06:14]	<nickrud>	djlenoir: it should have been removed automatically; if not, look for the right one in /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications
[none]	[06:14]	<MSTK>	"jimmygoon - i had beryl, and then I upgraded and my windows manager swithced it ""unknown"" and i had pretty much none to speak of"
[none]	[06:14]	<simplyubuntu>	nickrun?
[none]	[06:14]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: i changed the routers gateway to 192.168.1.1, i think that was causing the issue cause i just set the pc to static and it works now
[none]	[06:15]	<jimmygoon>	erm, you install beryl manually?
[none]	[06:15]	<simplyubuntu>	i mean nickrud
[none]	[06:15]	<djlenoir>	nickrud, thank you
[none]	[06:15]	<jimmygoon>	why did you change the gw?
[none]	[06:15]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: thanks for your help man
[negative]	[06:15]	<jscinoz>	Seveas, the falcon deb in your feisty repo is broken :(

Skype / Pidgin however, use the headset.  help?
[none]	[06:15]	<MSTK>	jimmygoon - any way to get beryl onto my system.  automatically or not.
[none]	[06:15]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: yes?
[none]	[06:15]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: cause they didnt match
[none]	[06:15]	<stan_ley>	Q: ( lsof -i ) can i limit to only 1 instance of process ?

[none]	[06:15]	<Zaerath>	Blah.
[none]	[06:15]	<simplyubuntu>	uh i just wanna know if i can avoid having to download anything *during* the upgrade
[none]	[06:15]	<simplyubuntu>	that possible?
[none]	[06:16]	<jimmygoon>	Kevin0, I really don't know what you mean by match
[none]	[06:16]	<jimmygoon>	match where?
[none]	[06:16]	<stan_ley>	simplyubuntu: what!!
[none]	[06:16]	<`eric->	hey where do programs get installed?
[none]	[06:16]	<KevinO>	the static computer and the router its connected too
[positive]	[06:16]	<MSTK>	jimmygoon - I thought so, too.  but after i upgraded, it seems to have exploded.
[none]	[06:16]	<jimmygoon>	MSTK, I'm sorry. I'm making the mistake of thinking beryl = compiz.fusion
[none]	[06:16]	<stan_ley>	`eric- ; wherever u want them to
[none]	[06:16]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: not really. a release needs to be upgraded as a whole, not piecemeal
[none]	[06:16]	<simplyubuntu>	stan_ley, i was trying to get anyone's attention but i felt about *this* small
[negative]	[06:16]	<simplyubuntu>	:(
[none]	[06:16]	<voidmage>	wow.
[none]	[06:16]	<stan_ley>	lol
[none]	[06:16]	<kd7swh>	Is the defualt shell in gusty still dash?
[none]	[06:16]	<usser>	`eric-: they usually spread all across the system
[none]	[06:16]	<jimmygoon>	ubuntu gutsy has compiz fusion out of box
[none]	[06:16]	<jimmygoon>	beryl is dead
[none]	[06:16]	<jimmygoon>	it remerged with compiz(-fustion)
[none]	[06:17]	<voidmage>	ever since today (which i'll probably attribute to youtube's changes)
[positive]	[06:17]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: told you that already ;)
[none]	[06:17]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, the gatewayo n the PC = the router IP
[none]	[06:17]	<MSTK>	jimmygoon - i never really understood the beryl-compiz merger. so now they are synonymous?
[none]	[06:17]	<voidmage>	firefox has been a whole lot less stable
[none]	[06:17]	<simplyubuntu>	so, say if i unplug my ethernet cable or turn of my router, will it skip downloading?
[none]	[06:17]	<usser>	`eric-: executables usually go to /usr/bin, program libraries to /usr/lib
[none]	[06:17]	<jimmygoon>	aka... gateway = 192.168.0.1
[none]	[06:17]	<jimmygoon>	MSTK, kinda
[none]	[06:17]	<KevinO>	oh crap
[none]	[06:17]	<stan_ley>	simplyubuntu: it wont upgrade unless u tell it to!
[none]	[06:17]	<petru>	helo!
[none]	[06:17]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: yes, but you'll most likely end up with a borked or broken install
[none]	[06:17]	<jimmygoon>	there was compiz.... then compiz-quinn, then compiz & beryl and now they've remerged into compiz-fusion
[none]	[06:17]	<`eric->	usser: well, i installed it via apt-get... where would it be insatlled?
[none]	[06:18]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: i totally forgot that
[none]	[06:18]	<stan_ley>	simplyubuntu: wat are u trying to do or not do watever the case may be ?
[none]	[06:18]	<kd7swh>	does anyone know if the defualt shell in gusty still dash?
[none]	[06:18]	<jimmygoon>	"MSTK, they're not synonymous persay, they are still ""sepeate"" though beryl is discontinued as far as I know... but compiz-fusion is the future as far as I understand"

[none]	[06:19]	<hydrogen>	automatix is bad.
[none]	[06:19]	<hydrogen>	!automatix
[negative]	[06:19]	<ubotu>	Automatix2 is a block of code which attempts to install some software.  When it fails and breaks systems, we don't provide support for it.  A creditable analysis from a debian/ubuntu developer is here - http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html (Additional information: /msg ubotu worksforme)
[none]	[06:19]	<kd7swh>	akincer: dash is a lightweight cop-out of bash that was in edgy, does gusty go back to using the full bash shell?
[none]	[06:19]	<aquagrunty>	petru: have you tried vlc?
[none]	[06:19]	<DanaG>	Is anybody going to make an compiz-fusion unofficial-plugins repo for Gutsy?
[negative]	[06:20]	<zyxnull>	petru: go to the automatix site, http://www.getautomatix.com/
[none]	[06:20]	<stan_ley>	simpyubuuntu: oh, i tried that a while back, broke my system, it might work for u. if u have all the necessary dependencies in cd
[none]	[06:20]	<hydrogen>	kd7swh: err, dash is the default rescue shell.. all veresions afaik have had bash
[none]	[06:20]	<jimmygoon>	DanaG, does trevino not have one up yet?
[none]	[06:20]	<DanaG>	I don't know, actually.
[none]	[06:20]	<zyxnull>	petru: install the tool, then install the codec software, that'll solve the problem
[none]	[06:20]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: why exactly are you not wanting to download stuff?
[none]	[06:20]	<jimmygoon>	DanaG, let me chekc, I suspect he does
[none]	[06:20]	<akincer>	I'm aware of dash, but bash is my shell and this is a fresh install as of about 30 minutes ago
[none]	[06:20]	<hydrogen>	"kd7swh: the ""default shell"" is a fairly misleading term"
[positive]	[06:20]	<stan_ley>	nickrud: cause he's reTaDed
[none]	[06:20]	<akincer>	or an hour or so
[none]	[06:20]	<hydrogen>	kd7swh: /bin/sh is still dash..
[none]	[06:21]	<jimmygoon>	gah, torrents eating too much bw
[none]	[06:21]	<petru>	thanks everybody!
[none]	[06:21]	<simplyubuntu>	but see i dont get this: if the upgrade were to download *anything*, even if it were for only my extra packages,. there wouldnt be 1400 files!
[none]	[06:21]	<hydrogen>	kd7swh: but, if you want bash you run it as /bin/bash.. oddly enough
[none]	[06:21]	<zafar>	i can anyone  help to upgrade my kubuntu 7.04 to 7.10
[none]	[06:21]	<aquagrunty>	"petru: if you are using compiz (appearence-> something other then ""normal settings"") you probably have to change the output"

[none]	[06:21]	<dystopianray>	fabio: maybe cedega or crossover
[none]	[06:21]	<stan_ley>	fabio: BEER !
[none]	[06:21]	<iobelisk>	how do i change keymap settings for X?
[none]	[06:21]	<nickrud>	stan_ley: usually people have reasons, but simplyubuntu that's about right, you'd be suprised at how granular ubuntu packaging is
[none]	[06:21]	<TwoD>	Anyone who knows what's wrong when the Appearance Preferences window doesn't update?
[none]	[06:21]	<jimmygoon>	fabio, what do you mean a better software? there is vmware, a full blown emulator, but it is slower and uses more memory
[none]	[06:21]	<simplyubuntu>	nickrud, because i live in pakistan and it takes me about 11 hours to download 700 mb!
[none]	[06:21]	<puff>	I'm working on a debian box that was set up by an extremely security-conscious admin.  One of the things he left out was /usr/sbin/sendmail, which an application uses to send email.
[none]	[06:21]	<usser>	fabio: cedega is for games, crossover for general programs
[none]	[06:21]	<mooma>	A question/comment. Upgrading to Gutsy all was going fine until I walked away while the new packages were being installed & the screen-saver asked for a password. I typed in my password multiple times and the machine would not log me in. I ended up having to go into a root term and using dpkg to get to a stable environment. The question I guess is what messed up the password?
[none]	[06:21]	<meoblast001>	hello

[none]	[06:22]	<akincer>	kd7swh: Applications > Accessories > Terminal and type ? hit enter at the command prompt. You should get bash: ?: command not found

[none]	[06:23]	<simplyubuntu>	so, nickrud, why would my computer want to download ALL the upgrades when ive given them to it on a bloody platter!

[none]	[06:23]	<stan_ley>	vernimousice: burning --> cdrecord -v -pad FILE.iso
[none]	[06:23]	<Dan2552>	KevinO: I always put gateway as the same IP as my router, and it always works
[none]	[06:23]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: because they aren't all on the platter. If you installed any kde apps, for example, that will pull down a load of packages
[none]	[06:24]	<bally>	has anyone faced a problem wid nvidia... board...
[none]	[06:24]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon: i have a gateway setting in my router settings

[none]	[06:24]	<fabio>	well any one have the lastest version of cedega?
[none]	[06:24]	<jimmygoon>	KevinO, leave it alone
[none]	[06:24]	<zyxnull>	fabio: Cedega isn't flawless, you should address the questions to the specific game on theri forums, maybe some of the gurus there can help

[none]	[06:24]	<zafar>	i can anyone  help to upgrade my kubuntu 7.04 to 7.10 . i have follow all steps as mentiond on web but it does now show any update
[none]	[06:24]	<simplyubuntu>	exactly nickrud, but i bet at the bottom of your pipe you didnt have frequent power outages which have corrupted your install several times before, forccing a grown man to cry

[none]	[06:24]	<Vlet>	fabio: yeah, running wow in it now
[none]	[06:25]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: and possibly that list of 1400 might be misleading, apt doesn't differentiate between apps on the cd and on the net
[none]	[06:25]	<KevinO>	jimmygoon:  nope, it was 192.168.1.1, the gateway was /0.1

[none]	[06:46]	<buntunub>	dxdt: whatever gave you that idea lol
[positive]	[06:46]	<levander>	nickrud: It's like they think they are part of a group that owns Ubuntu.  It's weird.

[none]	[06:46]	<TwoD>	joanki, I think I'm on to something: type gnome-appearance-properties in the terminal and see if you get any errors
[positive]	[06:46]	<hydrogen>	heartsblood: do you mean like gnome vs. kde or which window manager is used within gnome or kde?
[positive]	[06:46]	<jmagder>	elliott541a: lol.  I'd rather not. :-)
[none]	[06:46]	<linoleum>	Hi , guys, I have reinstalled ubuntu , from feisty to gusty, but now, I can't find any package, from canoncal parter, to medibutunu, who can make me install Realplayer
[none]	[06:47]	<joanki>	ok
[none]	[06:47]	<heartsblood>	hydrogen: within, ie metacity/compiz/etc.
[none]	[06:47]	<jmagder>	elliott541a: I had encrypted set up on 7.04, but I thought I'd do a reinstall.
[none]	[06:47]	<chronographer>	yeah I use nano if im stuck at command line
[none]	[06:47]	<joanki>	no errors
[none]	[06:47]	<dxdt>	"buntunub: actually, it never dawned on me until a friend pointed it out and then I was like MY GOD YOU""RE RIGHT!"

[none]	[06:47]	<dystopianray>	nano is rubbish compared to vim
[none]	[06:47]	<dxdt>	I use vim anyway, so it doesn't matter, but it was still like WHOA
[none]	[06:47]	<troxor>	luislo: oh, btw.. did you ever try to build the latest from source?
[none]	[06:47]	<joanki>	TwoD no errors
[none]	[06:47]	<levander>	linoleum: The upgrade process sets your sources.list back to a very thin default for the new release.  YOu have to re-add the repositories you installed those packages from to sources.list.

[none]	[06:48]	<elliott541a>	jmagder unfortunately I know nothing about encryption
[positive]	[06:48]	<hydrogen>	heartsblood: thats usually not a uuser visible setting.. I know that kde looks for the KDEWM env variable setting.. and I'd imagine that gnome does something about as predictable
[none]	[06:48]	<buntunub>	well for me nano is VERY user friendly and does the job 10 times out of 10

[none]	[06:48]	<hydrogen>	nano isn't bad
[none]	[06:48]	<nugod>	i've found nano to be great when you just want to get in, make a quick change and get out

[none]	[06:48]	<heartsblood>	hydrogen: that does answer my root question.  ty.
[none]	[06:48]	<hydrogen>	its just a whole bunch slower than vim once you get used to vim
[none]	[06:48]	<dxdt>	WAY slower
[none]	[06:48]	<nickrud>	nono is good for quickies, vim for a little more, emacs for things longer than 5 screens for me
[positive]	[06:49]	<jmagder>	elliott541a: thanks anyways. :)  I just booted up into the installer again, and it looks like some how the partition was destroyed. Tht would be a problem.  I'll try again.  :)
[none]	[06:49]	<dxdt>	swapping two lines in vim is 3 keystrokes
[none]	[06:49]	<dystopianray>	vim > emacs

[none]	[06:49]	<elliott541a>	akincer: I'm not getting them
[positive]	[06:49]	<hydrogen>	and it doesn't work well after you use vim because you end up with random letters all over your screen :)
[none]	[06:49]	<buntunub>	thats the key there.. vim takes alot of getting used to unlike nano

[none]	[06:49]	<nickrud>	I still think they should put that one back
[none]	[06:49]	<hydrogen>	buntunub: right.
[none]	[06:49]	<simplyubuntu>	nickrud!
[none]	[06:49]	<akincer>	Comparing vi and nano is like comparing a spoon and a spork.
[none]	[06:49]	<hydrogen>	buntunub: well.. runnig vimtutor is enough to get used to it mostly
[none]	[06:49]	<nickrud>	dxdt: it used to have a really sarcastic blurb

[none]	[06:50]	<hydrogen>	how about we take out the part between [ and ]
[none]	[06:50]	<hydrogen>	and just leave it with wars are silly.
[none]	[06:50]	<LiMaO>	riotkittie: the noun insertion itself is optional. wars are silly.
[none]	[06:50]	<hydrogen>	because flamewars are silly
[none]	[06:50]	<kwtm>	Man, this .tar.bz2 file sure takes long to read!  I just want to see what's in the archive, for crying out loud!  I wonder if .bz2.tar would work better.
[none]	[06:50]	<hydrogen>	err
[positive]	[06:50]	<ubutom>	nickrud: editorwar, the war between editors waged on several centuries, until **** won :-)
[none]	[06:50]	<hydrogen>	thats a noun though
[none]	[06:50]	<heartsblood>	hydrogen: If a user can't manipulate the defualt window manager, what setting(s) are available to them?  if I wanted to run compiz on 1 user and meta on another (without using gconf-editor) how would I do it?
[none]	[06:50]	<hydrogen>	couldbewars are silly!
[positive]	[06:51]	<ubutom>	sorry, im a bad impostor, hehe :)
[none]	[06:51]	<nickrud>	ubutom: heh
[none]	[06:51]	<dxdt>	see I disagree.  Not only do I think flamewars are productive, I think they let people vent frustrations that otherwise may be built up and released in more harmful ways.  Flamewars on the internet rock
[positive]	[06:51]	<riotkittie>	LiMaO: not necessarily. but that's OT, so i'll shut up :P
[positive]	[06:51]	<nickrud>	ubutom: not real bad, either ;)
[positive]	[06:51]	<hydrogen>	heartsblood: I'd guess you would run compiz --replace & in an autostart file for one user
[none]	[06:51]	<LiMaO>	riotkittie: OT?

[none]	[06:51]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: you'll have to remove a lot of stuff to avoid downloading stuff
[none]	[06:51]	<heartsblood>	hydrogen: but that wont save.  how do I make that a defualt for the session?
[none]	[06:52]	<akincer>	elliott: have you read any of the Samba docs at samba.org?
[none]	[06:52]	<ubutom>	think so, Ryuho

[positive]	[06:52]	<hydrogen>	heartsblood: if its in an autostart file it will run every time you log in

[none]	[06:53]	<simplyubuntu>	at least 4 hours for 415 mb

[none]	[06:53]	<simplyubuntu>	so youre saying this is natural, and there's nothing i can do to avoid it?
[none]	[06:53]	<riotkittie>	critt: did you enable window decoration plugin in compizconfig-settings-manager?
[none]	[06:53]	<troxor>	luislo: it's not building for me without a fight, still working at it
[none]	[06:54]	<akincer>	elliott: Things change from version to version. Plus, is this a simple environment or are you running an auth server like LDAP or Active Directory?
[none]	[06:54]	<buntunub>	get emerald and just do emerald --replace
[none]	[06:54]	<critt>	riotkittie yes I did
[none]	[06:54]	<luislo>	troxor: :O you already build it? coz you have to install before many dependencies... which website are you following?
[none]	[06:54]	<ToddEDM>	hey guys, how do i install Flash?
[none]	[06:54]	<buntunub>	or dont and do metacity --replace

[none]	[06:54]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: yes
[none]	[06:54]	<Ryuho>	how big do you guys make your swap partition? should i even make one?
[none]	[06:54]	<simplyubuntu>	darn it.
[none]	[06:54]	<nickrud>	ToddEDM: sudo aptitude install flashplugin-nonfree
[none]	[06:55]	<asc>	critt: Ask in #ubuntu-effects; there are fixes. One thing you can try is running gtk-window-decorator --replace, but there's at least one Uberwizard in effects who fixed that for me.
[none]	[06:55]	<w4ett>	ToddEDM: from Synaptic
[none]	[06:55]	<h1st0>	Ryuho: 1.5 times amount of ram is usually a good rule.
[none]	[06:55]	<dxdt>	Ryuho: personally 2x ram up to 1 GB for me.  I can't imagine swapping more than 1GB but if you are doing movies or something you may want to do more than that.  I personally don't
[none]	[06:55]	<buntunub>	ryohu you dont necessarily need a swap, but its highly advisable
[none]	[06:55]	<simplyubuntu>	if my power goes out while dowloading pkgs it shouldnt be an issue right?
[none]	[06:55]	<h1st0>	Ryuho: er 2.56
[none]	[06:55]	<asc>	ryohu: How much RAM do you have?
[none]	[06:55]	<h1st0>	Ryuho: jesus I can't type tonight.
[none]	[06:55]	<dxdt>	"Ryuho: you want swap unless you can answer the question ""Do I need swap?"" without asking."
[none]	[06:55]	<Ryuho>	lol ya
[none]	[06:55]	<nickrud>	simplyubuntu: no, it will resume downloading where it left off.
[none]	[06:55]	<elliott541a>	akincer: There's nothing special about it. the computer is running dapper if that means anything

[none]	[06:56]	<levander>	Anybody know what I should start reading to figure out why my soundcard doesn't work after upgrading to Gutsy?
[none]	[06:56]	<phrost>	any idea what would cause a system to hang at Running local boot scripts (/etc/rc.local) ?

[none]	[06:56]	<Ryuho>	well.. that's a lot

[none]	[06:56]	<dxdt>	Ryuho: I have one GB and I don't think I've ever swapped more than like 300mb so yeah 2GB should be more than enough.  1 GB is probably OK for you.

[none]	[06:57]	<dxdt>	it is still there, just new name
[none]	[06:57]	<akincer>	elliott: Is this a Linux to Linux file share?
[none]	[06:57]	<riotkittie>	doesn ubuntu-effects redirect to #compiz
[none]	[06:57]	<elliott541a>	akincer: nope, I just used apt-get. Should I look for instructions specific to that version?
[none]	[06:57]	<h1st0>	Ryuho: as long as you have slightly more swap then ram you should be fine.  I used the installer and 1gig of ram it made 1gig of swap.
[none]	[06:57]	<asc>	Oh, #u-e redirects to #compiz-fusion
[none]	[06:57]	<h1st0>	dxdt: no its gone

[none]	[06:57]	<elliott541a>	akincer: there will be both linux and windows users using it
[none]	[06:58]	<h1st0>	akincer: They got rid fo that channel since compiz-fusion is on by default now.
[none]	[06:58]	<dxdt>	h1st0: then why the redirect?  They would just send you to nowhere if it was really gone.
[none]	[06:58]	<asc>	Ryuho: Probably because they did the same thing, I guess. But I think you meant to ask h1st0

[none]	[06:59]	<LastLemming>	hi
[none]	[06:59]	<h1st0>	dxdt: They got rid of it since compiz-fusion is enabled by default now.  THere is no need to have another room for it.  The old #desktop-effects is gone and support for it is now here.
[none]	[06:59]	<SeNsEi_SaMe>	ahi ppl
[none]	[06:59]	<simplyubuntu>	or maybe they're just REALLY small package files

[positive]	[06:59]	<asc>	Ryuho: Also, I can't speak for anyone else but I usually recommend small amounts of swap. If you're swapping more than 256ish under a desktop workload, the system will be nearly unresponsive anyway. :p

[none]	[08:05]	<Cyber_Stalker>	whats the command i use that will show me the name of my sound card?
[none]	[08:05]	<simplyubuntu>	lordprofit?
[none]	[08:05]	<lordprofit>	oh the rootkit?
[none]	[08:05]	<darren>	tvst: both
[none]	[08:05]	<simplyubuntu>	yep
[none]	[08:05]	<darren>	tvst: it prompted for both installs
[none]	[08:05]	<tenemag>	seriously though, how do I switch themes in Emerald?

[none]	[08:05]	<mog_>	hello
[none]	[08:05]	<Fyda>	tenemag: emerald-theme-manager, perhaps?
[none]	[08:06]	<tvst>	darren: strange. did you try reinstalling flash? aptitude reinstall flashplugin-nonfree
[none]	[08:06]	<darren>	tvst: I installed gnash and reloaded and it asked to install flash and I installed that too
[none]	[08:06]	<nikolai>	fatcat can you be more specific in the compiz config all i have are options to enable different effects and such, not where i can load my image
[none]	[08:06]	<fatcatmatt>	tenemag: hit alt+f2 and type emerald --release
[none]	[08:06]	<tenemag>	Fyda: tried that
[none]	[08:06]	<tenemag>	fatcatmatt: aight hold on
[none]	[08:06]	<mboso>	I just upgraded to gutsy, and i only have one out of two CPUs recgonize. Athalon dual core
[none]	[08:06]	<tvst>	darren: gnash will probably not work well for youtube (i never tried, but i read somewhere it's compatible with flash up to 7 only.)

[none]	[08:06]	<Cyber_Stalker>	why does every body seem to be ignoring me? its 1 command to list devices
[none]	[08:06]	<Geoffrey2>	however, now that I installed Gutsy, I'm not sure how to apply that option when booting from the hard drive
[positive]	[08:06]	<tenemag>	fatcatmatt: it's already released :-\
[none]	[08:07]	<fatcatmatt>	tenemag: i mean emerald --replace
[none]	[08:07]	<simplechat>	lordprofit: so what would you suggest?
[none]	[08:07]	<darren>	tvst: how to uninstall gnash?
[none]	[08:07]	<klos>	is there already a .deb for vmware for gutsy ???
[positive]	[08:07]	<lordprofit>	for...the rootkit?  ;)
[none]	[08:07]	<tvst>	aptitude purge gnash

[positive]	[08:09]	<Ryuho>	i have ubuntu installed, i just deleted my xp partition and is interested in adding it to ubuntu
[none]	[08:09]	<simplyubuntu>	!envy
[none]	[08:09]	<ubotu>	envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[none]	[08:09]	<TwoD>	Argh... been trying everything I can think of, still can't get the Appearance Preferences window to update when clicking something
[none]	[08:09]	<lordprofit>	oh i have no clue
[none]	[08:09]	<rredd4>	Cyber_Stakler  you should see something about audio controller
[none]	[08:09]	<fatcatmatt>	ryuho: dont know that you can increase it once it's set.  if anything, try using gparted
[none]	[08:09]	<lordprofit>	i don't have a need for advanced graphics so i don't futz with that stuff
[none]	[08:10]	<simplyubuntu>	youre lucky
[none]	[08:10]	<riotkittie>	Ryuho: you could use gparted on a ubuntu live CD if you have one on hand, or download the actual gparted live cd
[positive]	[08:10]	<simplyubuntu>	i cant stay away from them :D
[positive]	[08:10]	<Cyber_Stalker>	yea rredd4 i know what im looking for just didnt know how to find it :D but this doesnt fix my sound problem

[none]	[08:10]	<simplechat>	lordprofit: so, i need a windows cd, chkdsk the other drive then restart and it should come up?
[none]	[08:10]	<Colro>	Does anyone know if there's a way to temporarily disable xserver-xgl without having to uninstall it? I need to disable it every time I want to play a particular game with WINE, and uninstalling/reinstalling and rebooting every time is kind of annoying and cumbersome.
[none]	[08:10]	<Ryuho>	riotkittie cool i have liveCD

[none]	[08:11]	<simplechat>	lordprofit: ntfs stuffups, again
[none]	[08:11]	<riotkittie>	Ryuho: i'm not sure if gparted's on the LiveCDs prior to gutsy, if not you can apt-get install it while using the live disc
[none]	[08:11]	<simplyubuntu>	lordprofit if youre wondering where i thought of rootkits from, its from a user called riotkittie

[none]	[08:12]	<fatcatmatt>	kk colro
[none]	[08:12]	<lordprofit>	oh.  you need to do more than chkdsk then.  you need to reinstall the boot manager for NTFS....trying to remember how to do that
[positive]	[08:12]	<fatcatmatt>	simplechat: get an iso of windows and start over :)
[none]	[08:12]	<rredd4>	riotkittie  depends how you installed it
[none]	[08:12]	<Colro>	dystopianray: I know, that's what I meant, it's just annoying to have to uninstall/reinstall it so often.
[none]	[08:12]	<riotkittie>	Boot with the WinXp install CD, enter recovery console, FIXMBR lordprofit
[none]	[08:12]	<riotkittie>	or fixboot
[none]	[08:13]	<simplechat>	riotkittie: corrupted the partition table, each and every time i tried. (i tried for the best part of a week, ~30 installs.)
[none]	[08:13]	<lordprofit>	ah yes
[none]	[08:13]	<dystopianray>	Colro: so stop using it, get nvidia graphics
[none]	[08:13]	<Jban>	I need some USB help

[none]	[08:13]	<Ryuho>	the accessibility package should allow a user to use the onboard keyboard to type in the user name and the password. this is important not only for handicapped user but also for tablets where you have no keyboard connected.
[none]	[08:13]	<Ryuho>	was this fixed?
[none]	[08:14]	<lordprofit>	usually though it ends up totally hosed
[none]	[08:14]	<Ryuho>	it's a bug report on 7.10
[negative]	[08:14]	<Colro>	dystopianray: If only I could afford a new gfx card atm :(
[none]	[08:14]	<lordprofit>	and you *do* have to reinstall
[none]	[08:14]	<dystopianray>	Colro: get a geforce fx 5200, they're really cheap
[none]	[08:14]	<riotkittie>	Ryuho: if the bug report isnt marked as close, it's a safe guess no

[none]	[08:16]	<simplechat>	_blitz_: why didn't you just use apt?
[none]	[08:16]	<lordprofit>	you don't *really* want to build FF from source do you?
[none]	[08:16]	<simplechat>	lordprofit: great minds think alike?
[none]	[08:16]	<lordprofit>	lol
[none]	[08:16]	<Sorcererbob>	could someone please help me. I've just installed 7.10 and have compiz working well indeed. The only problem I have is when I rotate the cube, it snaps into the desired desktop very slowly, kinda wobbling around a bit before becoming usable. Its only a quarter of a second wait, but its annoying. I can't find the setting to make it snap back faster. Could someone please direct me to it.
[none]	[08:16]	<jiger>	hello all. am facing a severe problem with upgrding to gusty
[none]	[08:16]	<_blitz_>	how ? i am a newbie and not familiar
[none]	[08:16]	<riotkittie>	latest firefox = 3.0?
[none]	[08:16]	<tenemag>	lordprofit: lol building FF from source...  memories of gentoo...  longest compile EVER
[none]	[08:16]	<lordprofit>	sudo apt-get install firefox
[none]	[08:16]	<eddie_>	Hi everyone
[none]	[08:17]	<lordprofit>	but you should already have it on ubuntu....
[none]	[08:17]	<tenemag>	seriously though, how can I get my menu bars back?
[none]	[08:17]	<jiger>	I am not able to mount /usr though that partion exists
[none]	[08:17]	<tenemag>	I used ALT-F2 to get to IRC just so I could ask lol
[none]	[08:17]	<BHSPitLappy>	jiger, you have a separate /usr partition?
[none]	[08:17]	<_blitz_>	thanks guys
[none]	[08:17]	<riotkittie>	tenemag: gnome-panel?   or something else?
[none]	[08:17]	<jiger>	on booting fsck fails wiht error 8, superblock blah blah error
[none]	[08:17]	<lordprofit>	anyways simplechat: you could just reinstall windows fresh
[none]	[08:17]	<jiger>	yes
[none]	[08:17]	<Sorcererbob>	"tenemag: can you just execute ""metacity"" to restore the nominal window manager?"
[none]	[08:17]	<eddie_>	I have put Ubuntu on my laptop and internet is not working.  I was wondering if it does not have the driver although PCLinuxOS worked from installation
[none]	[08:17]	<lordprofit>	that almost always fixes that danged MBR problem
[none]	[08:18]	<xiij>	odd, Gusty comes with Firefox 2.0.0.6 but the latest version is 2.0.0.8 according to firefox.com
[none]	[08:18]	<vega->	xiij: whats so odd about that?
[none]	[08:18]	<tenemag>	nope
[none]	[08:18]	<BHSPitLappy>	xiij, point?
[positive]	[08:18]	<eddie_>	It is NetLink BCM5787M Gigibit Ethernet PCI Express
[none]	[08:18]	<PaPaFD>	Sorcererbob:  Try Shift+F10
[none]	[08:18]	<jiger>	but running livecd of 6.06 loads that partion fine
[positive]	[08:18]	<tenemag>	Sorcererbob: tried it :-\
[none]	[08:18]	<xiij>	just curious why gusty would ship an older version
[none]	[08:18]	<lordprofit>	xiij: meh-2.0.0.8 just came out
[none]	[08:18]	<eddie_>	Anybody know where I can get driver from?
[none]	[08:18]	<BHSPitLappy>	xiij, gutsy comes with the version that was out when firefox was pulled in.  .8 is really new.
[none]	[08:19]	<vega->	xiij: of course there can't be latest versions of everything, there needs to be time to test stuff
[none]	[08:19]	<Jban>	How do I get all of my laptop sound to come out through my USB headset?  Skype / Pidgin use the headset, but a DVD movie or Youtube do not.  I already have it selected in the sound options.... any ideas?
[none]	[08:19]	<riotkittie>	maybe 2.0.0.6 was the version available when gutsy froze?
[negative]	[08:19]	<Sorcererbob>	PaPaFD: that changed it in such a way that it took 5 seconds to be usable instead of 1/4 second
[none]	[08:19]	<xiij>	ok, fair enough, I would think though the newer one would be in the respostiory
[none]	[08:19]	<lordprofit>	you'll be fine with v2006
[none]	[08:19]	<BHSPitLappy>	xiij, enable backports.
[none]	[08:19]	<jiger>	somebody please guide how force detech of my partion which for some weird reason is not being displayed though fdisk shows my partion
[none]	[08:19]	<Sorcererbob>	now all the effects are going SUPER slow
[none]	[08:19]	<riotkittie>	Jban: still looking for help? :o  have you tried posting at ubuntuforums.org ? someone there may be able to answer
[none]	[08:19]	<Sorcererbob>	what does Shift+F10 do?
[none]	[08:19]	<tenemag>	it has to be something with Emerald....
[none]	[08:19]	<Jban>	lol every time I post no one answers
[none]	[08:19]	<BHSPitLappy>	xiij, aside from security updates, you stick with the versions of software that were out when the Ubuntu version was released
[negative]	[08:19]	<jMerliNz>	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/154354
[none]	[08:20]	<PaPaFD>	its a toggle hit it again
[none]	[08:20]	<jMerliNz>	was there ever an answer to this bug?
[none]	[08:20]	<lordprofit>	jban: you ask the tough questions that's why
[none]	[08:20]	<xiij>	ok, that's fine I guess.
[none]	[08:20]	<Sorcererbob>	aha, very good
[none]	[08:20]	<riotkittie>	jMerliNz: if the bug's not marked as close, i'd assume no
[none]	[08:20]	<Sorcererbob>	ok, that was the opposite of what I wanted
[none]	[08:20]	<lordprofit>	i'd guess not a lot of people use USB headsets
[none]	[08:20]	<Jban>	lordprofit: Look, you know, someone has to around here *puts on Jack Bauer face*
[none]	[08:20]	<lordprofit>	lol
[none]	[08:20]	<Sorcererbob>	I'm thinking it would be in the desktop cube or rotate cube settings. I just can't identify which one
[none]	[08:20]	<Jban>	"""DAMNIT!"""
[positive]	[08:20]	<Jban>	lol :P
[none]	[08:20]	<marx2k>	Interesting...Im sharing a folder on the SMB network, yet other computers cant see it... wonder why that is
[none]	[08:20]	<lordprofit>	ugh SMB
[none]	[08:21]	<Sorcererbob>	firewall, marx2k?
[none]	[08:21]	<Jban>	hahaha

[none]	[08:21]	<rredd4>	Jban  get a headset with a plug on it.  a mini plug   that will solve your problem
[none]	[08:21]	<marx2k>	not running any...this is a default gutsy install
[positive]	[08:21]	<Sorcererbob>	ssh in from the local network :rolleyes: :P
[none]	[08:21]	<lordprofit>	firewall on the SMB share?
[none]	[08:21]	<marx2k>	lordprofit, SMB makes it a lot easier for other clients
[none]	[08:21]	<Jban>	rredd4: What?
[positive]	[08:21]	<lordprofit>	yah i know :P i was half joking
[none]	[08:21]	<Jban>	rredd4: It's recognised by Ubuntu
[none]	[08:21]	<marx2k>	lordprofit, its a default gutsy installed...no firewall should be working
[none]	[08:21]	<tenemag>	Sorcererbob: any other ideas on how to get the menu back?
[none]	[08:22]	<nitalaut>	hello guys, i've got strange problem with gutsy - in hungs while booting with nvidia fx5200 videocard inserted(if i use intergrated video card system boots normally)
[none]	[08:22]	<robotphood>	anyone know how i can bind my mouse back/forward buttons to work in konqueror/dolphin
[none]	[08:22]	<BHSPitLappy>	marx2k, try \\IP.OF.UBUNTU.BOX\NameOfShare in a windows address bar
[none]	[08:22]	<eegore>	I am getting superblock errors when I try to mount an xfs files system, is there a recorerry or is it hosed
[none]	[08:22]	<lordprofit>	oh sorry; misunderstood
[none]	[08:22]	<Sorcererbob>	tenemag: sorry mate. I'm not a pro at all. Is it the title bars that have disappeared when you run compiz? cause nvidia cards used to have some serious problems with compiz/beryl
[none]	[08:23]	<mdalek>	has anyone noticed that gdm login screen to usable desktop loading time is like 10times slower on gutsy
[none]	[08:23]	<tenemag>	it's an ATI card....  and no, just the nice GNOME Menu off the top that shows the time, date, battery, wifi, etc
[none]	[08:23]	<tenemag>	like the WHOLE bar is missing
[none]	[08:23]	<marx2k>	BHSPitLappy: Yeah I was hoping it wouldnt have to come to that
[none]	[08:23]	<Sorcererbob>	oh. OH. Thats rather odd indeed!
[positive]	[08:23]	<riotkittie>	mdalek: no. i have noticed that on my default install, the resolution sucks, tho :P
[positive]	[08:23]	<Jban>	I'd rather go through Season3 of 24 than have to keep asking, but I refuse to go to bed without victory :P
[positive]	[08:23]	<Sorcererbob>	I'll google it :)
[none]	[08:23]	<BHSPitLappy>	marx2k, aside from that, you have workgroup issues to figure out
[negative]	[08:23]	<mdalek>	it takes longer to get to desktop from login than to boot from bios to login :(
[none]	[08:23]	<marx2k>	uh uh
[none]	[08:23]	<tenemag>	lol aight...
[none]	[08:23]	<BHSPitLappy>	marx2k, digging into samba configuration and what not.
[negative]	[08:23]	<mdalek>	and my hdd is thrashing.... i've got 1gig ram :(

[none]	[08:23]	<tenemag>	lol
[none]	[08:24]	<marx2k>	yeah *sigh*
[none]	[08:24]	<riotkittie>	tenemag: ALT + F2  killall gnome-panel
[none]	[08:24]	<BHSPitLappy>	tenemag, possible that you right-clicked and chose Delete This Panel by accident
[none]	[08:25]	<tenemag>	ah it's back!!
[none]	[08:25]	<riotkittie>	tenemag: or did you perhaps delete that panel?  >_>  if it's just flubbed, killing it will respawn it and it should work ok
[none]	[08:25]	<BHSPitLappy>	marx2k, might be more helpful to bring it up in #samba
[none]	[08:25]	<tenemag>	that worked

[none]	[08:52]	<Boumboum6>	monte84: Ubuntu has a built-in firewall. You need to enter the firewall and set it to block the games.
[none]	[08:52]	<dystopianray>	aeshyamae: disconnect from the internet, it'll finish and then come back in here
[none]	[08:52]	<riotkittie>	aeshyamae: how long has it been stuck there?  if you hit the caps lock or number lock, do the keyboard lights respond?
[none]	[08:52]	<monte84>	Boumboum6, yes, just not sure how to do that
[none]	[08:52]	<zethero1>	"when I install something with ""make install"" is there a way to uninstall as well?"
[none]	[08:52]	<dystopianray>	zethero1: no
[none]	[08:52]	<Boumboum6>	aeshyamae: Not really...but you'll need to reinstall from the start.

[none]	[08:53]	<riotkittie>	zethero1: use checkinstall for that.  you can find it in the repos, then you make & checkinstall rather than makeinstall
[none]	[08:53]	<dystopianray>	bdgraue_: no idea sorry
[none]	[08:53]	<Dark>	I have been working on it very slowly but I am still in school
[positive]	[08:53]	<ExRarne>	Ugh... I decreased the size of the XP partiton, installed Ubuntu and everything was going fine, I installed a few programs etc... I login today and Ubuntu isn't accepting my password. I boot into windows, it's going crazy, explorer isn't working, the screen is frozen (except for mIRC which I was able to boot up via TaskMan)... What the fuck is going on?
[none]	[08:53]	<DShepherd>	tokyoahead, go to system - prefs - appearance. and check out the visual effect tab
[none]	[08:53]	<riotkittie>	yaaaaay pooyak.

[none]	[08:54]	<zethero1>	riotkittie: so now that I have installed something with make install, there is no way to remove it?
[negative]	[08:54]	<Boumboum6>	ExRarne: sounds to me like one of the installs overwrote the other. :(   (a  newbie guess)
[none]	[08:54]	<dystopianray>	aeshyamae: oh it got stuck before you connected to the internet?

[positive]	[08:54]	<DShepherd>	Heaven, np. that;s what friends are for :-).
[positive]	[08:54]	<ExRarne>	Would the best solution would be going to GpartED via the liveCD and restore the original size of XP?
[none]	[08:54]	<monte84>	dont guess anyone here is running ubuntu with an HD2900 card eh?
[positive]	[08:54]	<riotkittie>	ExRarne: can you chkdsk your win partition?   do you have restore points available?  [though i cant imagine ubuntu would have caused such issues with xp]

[none]	[08:55]	<Colro>	My GTK theme makes several windows in Azureus completely unreadable -- is there a way to make it ignore themes and/or use its own?
[none]	[08:55]	<Boumboum6>	ExRarne: no the best solution is to restore from your backups that hopefully you did before the installs.
[none]	[08:55]	<ExRarne>	I'm chkdsk'ing the system
[none]	[08:55]	<dystopianray>	aeshyamae: it got stuck when i did a few installs and I pulled the ethernet and it proceeding, the servers it is checking are too hammered to respond properly
[none]	[08:55]	<riotkittie>	zethero1: no, not usually. sometimes you can make uninstall but it depends on how the package was put together and whatnot
[none]	[08:55]	<DUUUUUDE>	i am really impressed by ubuntu/xubuntu/kubuntu. wow!
[none]	[08:56]	<aeshyamae>	dystopianray:a fresh install from start will not do any harm ok?

[none]	[08:56]	<aeshyamae>	dystopianray: opps then what to do?even without net it will stuck?
[none]	[08:57]	<ExRarne>	I'm convinced the error was somewhere within the install
[none]	[08:57]	<dystopianray>	aeshyamae: i'm not sure, it shouldn't do anything with no net
[none]	[08:57]	<critt>	upgraded to 7.10 now I have no sound playing avi files with any player.  Anyone know what I can do to fix this?
[none]	[08:57]	<Boumboum6>	there's a distro based on Ubuntu called Mint.....has a green theme instead of Ubuntu's orangish-brown...also better multimedia support in the box.
[positive]	[08:57]	<simplechat>	wow, gusties default backround looks pretty damn hot :)
[negative]	[08:57]	<NorthByNorthWest>	Hi all! Just installed Gibbon... then installed Azureus... it wont start (well... it quits when started)... running from terminal gives: http://pastebin.com/m4049542a Any ideas how to fix this?
[none]	[08:57]	<aeshyamae>	dystopianray: ok anyway trying once more is the only option for me no?
[positive]	[08:57]	<riotkittie>	gutsy's default background looked pretty darn ugly, in my book :P
[none]	[08:57]	<Boumboum6>	ExRarne: sounds to me like your partitioning was screwed up...overlapping partitions.. That is a guess. You need to check that.
[none]	[08:57]	<dystopianray>	aeshyamae: I guess
[none]	[08:58]	<pooyak>	DShepherd, which one is animal. can't see their names
[none]	[08:58]	<zethero1>	is there a way to unload a module that I have manually loaded?
[none]	[08:58]	<aeshyamae>	ok thanks ill try
[none]	[08:58]	<void^>	NorthByNorthWest: install sun-java6-jre and get azureus at azureus.sf.net
[positive]	[08:58]	<Boumboum6>	I agree wi th riotkittie...luckily it's highly modifiable. :)
[positive]	[08:58]	<ExRarne>	Boumboum6: Well I have the specs for the original partition, perhaps deleting the Ubuntu ones and restoring the orignal size of the XP one will fix it?
[none]	[08:58]	<DShepherd>	pooyak, the elephant skin
[none]	[08:58]	<pooyak>	DShepherd, there's one that's like tree skin and that's nice
[none]	[08:58]	<Phuzion>	apt-get update should refresh the repositories, right?
[negative]	[08:58]	<ExRarne>	I didn't make any backsups because my brother has by external hard drive :(
[positive]	[08:58]	<riotkittie>	Boumboum6: changing it was the second thing i did. ;)

[positive]	[08:59]	<Boumboum6>	Ok I need to go...I too am dealing with getting a multi-boot system working....My original XP install got trashed during backup....re-installing it left Ubuntu intact but messed up other windows partitions...so I'm dealing with that now..
[none]	[08:59]	<aeshyamae>	dystopianray: one more q...i have a debian installed in my system..so by this time will that grub be gone?
[none]	[08:59]	<freezeman>	Anyone have a working xorg.conf for ATI Radeon 9200? If, please start a private chat please!

[none]	[09:00]	<Morgwyr>	Ubuntu boots to a black screen after alt install; I can load PuppyLinux on it just fine. Anyone know of a fix?
[none]	[09:00]	<riotkittie>	aeshyamae: if it's stuck on getting files, grub hasnt been installed. you should be able to boot to debian with no probs.
[none]	[09:00]	<DUUUUUDE>	ok i think gparted formated my other HD, now i cant seem to find my formated HD anywhere? help?
[positive]	[09:01]	<Boumboum6>	roitkittie: changing the partition back won't fix the problem if one or both of the partitions have been overwritten from the other partition....(the A install wrote in B's partition, the B install wrote to A's partition)...you have data damage if that's what happened. If my theory is right, you need to reinstall both OS's.  Wipe both partitions, install XP first, then install Ubuntu 2nd.
[none]	[09:01]	<h1st0>	Is there a way to re-generate the wine menu list?
[none]	[09:01]	<robbizzl1>	anyone?

[none]	[09:01]	<riotkittie>	aeshyamae: try logging out of the live user session and logging back in :|  you may need to reboot to have the install work  again though :|
[none]	[09:01]	<Boumboum6>	if there's data on any of the partitions you want to preserve, make backups of both before wiping... then restore files from the backup (but not the whole OS--just the files you want to keep)
[none]	[09:02]	<robbizzl1>	just hang, blinking cursor ???? PLease HELP me!
[none]	[09:02]	<aeshyamae>	riotkittie: ok thanks ill look into it

[none]	[09:02]	<h1st0>	Phuzion: you have to upgrade to each version youc an't just jump to current.

[none]	[09:03]	<Boumboum6>	wonder if there's a way to recover or erase passwords in Ubuntu?  If not, you can still boot from the liveCD and with root privileges, access every file on your install.
[none]	[09:03]	<h1st0>	Phuzion: read the message from ubotu
[none]	[09:03]	<dystopianray>	Phuzion: or do a fresh install of the latest
[none]	[09:03]	<riotkittie>	Morgwyr: what graphics card are you using?
[none]	[09:03]	<DShepherd>	Morgwyr, compiz running maybe?
[none]	[09:03]	<h1st0>	Boumboum6: sure there is just boot to livecd and reset users passwords etc...
[none]	[09:03]	<Morgwyr>	(riotkittie): a semi-new nvidia 8800 gts
[none]	[09:03]	<dystopianray>	Boumboum6: you cannot recover passwords but you can modify or erase them

[none]	[09:03]	<robbizzl1>	dshepherd it just hangs loading cd-rom driver....I am installing from the unpacked ISO in a folder
[none]	[09:03]	<simplechat>	ok this is wierd, ubuntu wouldn't find my internal ntfs disk, but the gusty installer did.
[none]	[09:04]	<Morgwyr>	DShepherd; would that happen even when i was installing? i had to alt install because it booted to the same black screen with the gui install.
[none]	[09:04]	<simplechat>	does this mean that gusty will find it next restart?
[none]	[09:04]	<robbizzl1>	should I place the files elswhere?
[none]	[09:04]	<h1st0>	simplechat: if it found it by itself it will.
[none]	[09:04]	<Boumboum6>	simplechat: I had the same problem. But they can be mounted manually if the fs is undamaged, and you can install a line in fstab to automount at boot time.
[positive]	[09:04]	<robbizzl1>	Dshepherd: I don't even get to a GUI

[none]	[09:07]	<simplechat>	neur1: is this apt?

[none]	[09:07]	<critt>	Anyone know what I can do to fix sound playing avi files?
[none]	[09:07]	<nickrud>	neur1: yes, apt supports resuming downloads for the upgrade
[none]	[09:07]	<simplechat>	neur1: it should be downloading to your cache
[none]	[09:08]	<Morgwyr>	riotkittie; the solution on the forums seems to be recongifuring the xserver, which i can't do .

[none]	[09:08]	<critt>	Boumboum6 ty anyway
[none]	[09:08]	<ompaul>	neur1, you can and more important you should go into synaptic and have it download only

[none]	[09:08]	<DShepherd>	critt, have you install the appropriate restricted drivers already?

[none]	[09:09]	<h1st0>	Laser87: ask the firefox devs.

[none]	[09:11]	<critt>	COol hope this works. You guys are to fast ..
[none]	[09:12]	<riotkittie>	in that case, put a file system on it, DUUUUUDE. and you're good to go.

[none]	[09:46]	<gustavo_>	ompaul it boots, do not freeze, just has a long delay
[none]	[09:47]	<dystopianray>	Matic`Makovec: so he has an nvidia card?
[none]	[09:47]	<heartsblood>	ompaul, i'll check them out ty.
[none]	[09:47]	<chronographer>	I think interfaces takes priority... if you cahnge stuff there it will be whats used...  So you can check it using 'ifconfig'

[none]	[09:47]	<ompaul>	gustavo_, this is normal, more so if the machine is of a low spec
[none]	[09:48]	<Alexy>	Heya, how do i set up a L2TP connection, using a modem connected via network connection?
[none]	[09:48]	<gustavo_>	ompaul but it shows messages that states: freeze and timeout... so its not normal

[none]	[09:50]	<gustavo_>	ompaul ok, will try

[none]	[09:51]	<ompaul>	Alexy, ask the channel
[none]	[09:51]	<Alexy>	i did, twice
[none]	[09:51]	<Minnozz>	chronographer: you found anything that's wrong in those pastes?
[none]	[09:51]	<Matic`Makovec>	void^, well he says it looks like the way he pasted on pastebin... I can't really tell you more
[positive]	[09:51]	<chronographer>	So do you have any problems???  The only thing I think is wrong is your netmask, which should be 255.0.0.0 (for ip of 10.0.0.*)  I believe. Also i thikn you need only one entry for wlan0 right?
[none]	[09:52]	<ompaul>	Alexy, you see you asked the channel:  how do i set up a L2TP connection, using a modem connected via network connection and I have no idea with L2TP is
[none]	[09:52]	<void^>	Matic`Makovec: that's just the way it looks when it works fine, except for the root part.
[none]	[09:52]	<chronographer>	what is sixxs ??
[none]	[09:52]	<Minnozz>	chronographer: it's an ipv6 tunnel broker
[none]	[09:53]	<ompaul>	Alexy, and I would use OpenVPN for a tunnel
[none]	[09:53]	<Alexy>	ompaul, Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a tunneling protocol used to support virtual private networks (VPNs).
[none]	[09:53]	<Minnozz>	chronographer: that's why there are 2 entries for wlan0, but I'm not 100% sure this is the right way
[none]	[09:53]	<simplechat>	back
[none]	[09:53]	<Matic`Makovec>	Yeah void^, he said that he tried to run it as normal user now and it didn't give him previous errors (I wonder what the hell was he thinking running it as root)
[none]	[09:53]	<Minnozz>	chronographer: but on the other hand, ipv6 works fine (I'm connected with it now) so I don't think that's the problem
[none]	[09:54]	<dystopianray>	why am I getting errors about not being able to load the nvidia kernel module?
[none]	[09:54]	<simplechat>	hey everybody, how do i get rid of the random conflicts with gusty?
[positive]	[09:54]	<Alexy>	ompaul, I have no knowledge regarding anything concerning protocols, I have just installed ubuntu today, so can you please explain?
[none]	[09:54]	<chronographer>	so whats the problem?
[none]	[09:54]	<ompaul>	Alexy, I would use a program called OpenVPN to create a tunnel
[none]	[09:54]	<simplechat>	chronographer: for random applications that i'm trying to install, apt just plain doesn't want to instlal them, citing conflicts.

[none]	[11:24]	<notgod>	jimmy_: I don't understand. This is supposed to be the wonderful new built-in 3D desktop in 7.10.
[none]	[11:24]	<murlidhar>	Dumptruck: err i am not sure i can help u in fstab cuz i don't want to break ur filesystem so it is better if u ask a geek
[none]	[11:24]	<rbs-tito>	zxcv24: There we go, it should just work from now on
[none]	[11:24]	<saloxin>	linux26: or install desktop and apt-get install apache2 ssh proftpc ircd
[none]	[11:24]	<ParanoyaM>	Does anybody know what is /bin/modprobe abnormal exit?
[none]	[11:24]	<linux26>	rbs-tito: How so? I was thinking of getting the desktop edition and installing the server-related software
[none]	[11:25]	<drama1981>	mao thats because you are using compiz you cant use dri and compiz at the same time. last i knew anyway
[negative]	[11:25]	<notgod>	jimmy_: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour#head-53fb1bb59cc05521a2a6f644d4808ff140d9adaa

[none]	[11:25]	<rbs-tito>	zxcv24: But we have set it to manually configured, so network-manager wont work. This will be fine if you don't intend to swap your network often
[none]	[11:25]	<rbs-tito>	rbs-tito: This is how things were done pre-network manager
[none]	[11:25]	<beni>	Mr: Couldnt you just plug the external drive on again?
[none]	[11:25]	<mao>	drama1981: Ahh... Doesn't vsyncing depend on DRI though?
[positive]	[11:25]	<Mr>	beni lol yeah I tried that ;)
[none]	[11:26]	<rbs-tito>	linux26: Ubuntu has two editions. Desktop and Server, desktop has a GUI, server has LAMP

[positive]	[11:26]	<jimmy_>	notgod:  not sure about what its supposed to be..  but under themes jsut fetch some in emerald
[none]	[11:26]	<linux26>	rbs-tito: I know, and I was thinking of getting the desktop part and installing the server things rather than getting the server part and installing the desktop things
[none]	[11:26]	<Mr>	beni its not like I come running for help without trying some stuff first... I attatched the HDD again... no difference...
[none]	[11:26]	<rafkid>	hi peeps - my gutsy upgrade does not work - it stalls near the end with an error message indicating the network is down  - there is a text message indicating bad repositories online? any ideas?
[none]	[11:26]	<murlidhar>	Dumptruck: my advice would be to just upgrade to gutsy because it gives all this as default (ntfs)
[none]	[11:26]	<rbs-tito>	linux26: Yeah, that is the way I do it
[none]	[11:27]	<Dumptruck>	hello everyone - I am trying to copy a boot.ini file to my NTFS disc  - I am using feisty yawn and the NTFS-config will not allow me to use NTFS support for internal drives - I have been told to use fstab but I am not familiar with it

[none]	[11:28]	<linux26>	rbs-tito: thanks
[none]	[11:28]	<saloxin>	"it's like ubuntu forgot to publish ""howto upgrade"" and just unleashed new repos"

[none]	[11:30]	<drama1981>	mao only thing i really know about is that compiz and dri cant coexist. because of fglrx not supporting them both at the same time. its supposted to change if aiglx ever gets supported by the fglrx driver

[none]	[11:30]	<pulseezar>	@mao maybe it'spossible to dl a 3rd party screensaver?
[none]	[11:31]	<beni>	Mr: No they changed their grub stuff

[none]	[11:32]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: yes, and i think that's partially the problem
[none]	[11:32]	<Mr>	beni yes... I checked and it had a UUID instead of a /dev/hdaX   so I tried different hda3 hda2 etc... still same problem
[none]	[11:32]	<RiffRaff>	does anyone know at least where i can seek for an answer? i didn't find anything and i'm quite a newbie
[none]	[11:32]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: is it possible w32codecs could cause a problem with that?

[none]	[11:32]	<tsukasa>	rbs-tito, i tried reinstalling it no avail... i also deleted ~/.openoffice still didnt fix it

[none]	[11:33]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: yes, but it happened in fesity as well
[none]	[11:33]	<tsukasa>	rbs-tito, is there a fix for it?

[none]	[11:33]	<Dumptruck>	ok - is there an easy way to upgrade to 7.10 without burning a cd?
[none]	[11:33]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: personally, i never used totem for audio anyway
[none]	[11:33]	<rbs-tito>	tsukasa: That sounds strange. Maybe you have a bad install of Ubuntu? Dodgy CD or download?
[none]	[11:33]	<Dumptruck>	I have 7.04
[positive]	[11:33]	<saloxin>	rafkid: welcome to new troubles
[none]	[11:34]	<beni>	Dumptruck: wait a second of course its very easy
[none]	[11:34]	<Mr>	saloxin what do you mean all disks are sd2 sd3 ?
[none]	[11:34]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: but i'm curious as to what's causing this problem
[none]	[11:34]	<Mr>	saloxin I have IDE not Sata
[none]	[11:34]	<tsukasa>	rbs-tito, nah. although i did use a nonexistant font when i started it the first time
[none]	[11:34]	<saloxin>	the scsi and ide subsystems have been merged - so now all disks are named sdX
[none]	[11:34]	<rbs-tito>	cyphase: Neither do I, but I do use the gstreamer backend. Can rythymbox play the files because that uses the same backend
[none]	[11:34]	<tsukasa>	rbs-tito, so its very possible the preferences are corrupted because of that
[none]	[11:34]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: yea, it can
[none]	[11:34]	<tsukasa>	rbs-tito, problem is i dont know where OOO keeps all of its preferences
[none]	[11:34]	<Zlew>	grub keeps throwing me an error 22, even though i followed the instructions to fix it..do i have to point it to my linux or windows partition?
[none]	[11:34]	<JW_704>	Can someone help me setup a Shoutcast server please? I am having issues
[none]	[11:34]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: this really seems to be a totem problem..
[none]	[11:34]	<tsukasa>	its in like 9 places from what i have heard
[none]	[11:34]	<RiffRaff>	beni: any idea?
[none]	[11:35]	<saloxin>	Mr: i have a thinkpad 40p with ageold ide disks. root is /dev/sda1
[none]	[11:35]	<rbs-tito>	tsukasa: Open synaptic, ununinstall all of the open office files but don't just remove them, choose to completely remove them
[none]	[11:35]	<cyphase>	rbs-tito: let me try deleting the configuration for totem.. i don't know if i've tried that
[none]	[11:35]	<rbs-tito>	tsukasa: Then try reinstalling. This way everything, including preferences, is deleted
[none]	[11:35]	<Mr>	"saloxin hmm ok so I should try different sda  ""versions"" ?"
[none]	[11:35]	<saloxin>	Mr: yeo
[negative]	[11:35]	<beni>	RiffRaff: Err.. This sounds like the driver is kinda bad.. :/

[none]	[11:37]	<ptrack88>	I believe it is installing the grub loader to the 500gb drive instead of the 160gb drive the installer is installing to.
[none]	[11:37]	<Andycasss>	Why cant i access vista shares when i dont have a password protection on in vista
[none]	[11:37]	<smmagic>	Longhorn? Like vista?

[none]	[11:38]	<ptrack88>	yeah
[positive]	[11:38]	<beni>	Andycasss: sorry I never tried it with Vista, We're having a homogen Linux Environment here ;)

[none]	[11:38]	<RiffRaff>	ah scuse me

[none]	[11:38]	<RiffRaff>	it was setpwc
[none]	[11:38]	<ptrack88>	i believe it is picking up some vista files on the my 500gb (different drive) and trying to install grub on it
[none]	[11:38]	<ptrack88>	instead of the drive that has linux on it
[none]	[11:38]	<ptrack88>	so guess what I did...
[none]	[11:38]	<ptrack88>	I unplugged the 500gb
[none]	[11:38]	<ptrack88>	didnt give it a choice
[none]	[11:39]	<Dumptruck>	how about System>administrator>upgrade manager>upgrade?
[none]	[11:39]	<ptrack88>	now it is deleting partitions, I will do a fresh install... reboot and hope.

[none]	[11:40]	<ptrack88>	smmagic...
[none]	[11:40]	<Dumptruck>	Some third party entries in your sources.list were disabled. You can re-enable them after the upgrade with the 'software-properties' tool or your package manager.  Why would it do this?
[none]	[11:40]	<ptrack88>	a question
[none]	[11:40]	<beni>	saloxin: this is possible but very advances
[none]	[11:40]	<ptrack88>	this one if for all of you
[none]	[11:40]	<ptrack88>	what SCSI# should display for one drive only during install
[none]	[11:40]	<gordonjcp>	Dumptruck: in case they provide packages that aren't compatible with gutsy
[none]	[11:40]	<ptrack88>	right now i think i am up to SCSI6
[none]	[11:40]	<ptrack88>	it keeps rising
[none]	[11:40]	<saloxin>	UltraNav: libapache2-mod-auth-pam
[none]	[11:41]	<saloxin>	beni: yep. vpn has made me cry many times
[none]	[11:41]	<murlidhar>	Dumptruck: just to be on safe side cuz the third party sources may only support feisty not gutsy
[none]	[11:41]	<niller>	hi guys

[none]	[11:41]	<Dumptruck>	oh - so that is why people don't want to upgrade - I wish I would have known before
[none]	[11:42]	<smmagic>	Lol moo

[none]	[11:42]	<gordonjcp>	Dumptruck: however there's no guarantee that some other repository will have gutsy packages up, so trying to grab them would break the update process

[none]	[11:42]	<niller>	only issue i have atm is that i cant get my bluetooth mouse to work

[none]	[11:43]	<Tigerman>	gutsy sucks
[none]	[11:43]	<Zlew>	beni: that site references disks i don't have, and since i only have access to this machine, its useless

[none]	[14:50]	<RootyRootRootWoo>	Hi, how do I configure compiz, when I hit Visual Effects --> Preferences, noting launches.
[none]	[14:50]	<LjL>	comatsu, then i strongly suggest that you do *not* install it. compile it and have fun with it in any way you want, but please do *not* become root and install it on your system. APT would get upset.    that said, not all programs use 'autoconf' (the thing that gives you ./configure). does it not come with an INSTALL file?
[none]	[14:51]	<VSpike>	which is more efficient - vnc or x11 remotely over ssh with compression?

[none]	[14:52]	<comatsu>	LjL: why would it be a problem if i installed it? (sorry for the stupid questions but im a total noob)

[none]	[14:53]	<agenta>	it's quite popular
[none]	[14:53]	<SuperPigs>	is it possible to recover deleted files on ext3?
[none]	[14:53]	<stefg>	Dumptruck, paste output of sudo fdisk -l to pastebin
[none]	[14:53]	<dano>	i'll try reinstalling..
[none]	[14:53]	<LjL>	comatsu, in Ubuntu, everything in the /usr directory is managed by APT. APT assumes that you *never* touch anything in it (except for /usr/local). so if you install stuff on it manually, without using the packages, the system may end up in an unpredictable state.
[none]	[14:53]	<LjL>	SuperPigs: mostly not.
[none]	[14:53]	<comatsu>	apt is aptitude?

[none]	[14:57]	<lamego>	the server cd, provides server packages
[positive]	[14:58]	<stefg>	Dumptruck, all you have to do is change the root for the XP entry to (hd2,0)
[none]	[14:58]	<HHRy>	Hi there everyone

[none]	[14:58]	<lamego>	svg, but the alternate cd does not come with server packages, like php5, apache2, etc
[none]	[14:59]	<stefg>	Dumptruck, then it's a BIOS or windows issue

[none]	[14:59]	<Dumptruck>	if windows was installed independently - wouldn't I need to map in the menu.lst?
[negative]	[14:59]	<ubotu>	svg: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD).

[none]	[16:06]	<xsacha>	stemount: KDE uses less RAM for me?
[none]	[16:06]	<jdong>	MasterShrek: I mean it helps with audio latency and other forms of instant response-times, but overall a -rt kernel is slower than a standard one in the big picture
[none]	[16:06]	<MasterShrek>	jdong, i dont know, i think a low-latency kernel is better
[none]	[16:06]	<LjL>	MasterShrek: KDE is smaller...?
[none]	[16:06]	<stemount>	hmmm GNOME uses much less for me
[none]	[16:06]	<nitalaut>	my ubuntu 7.10 hangs while booting with nvidia fx5200
[none]	[16:07]	<jdong>	LjL: it's kind of true -- a kde install without all that stuff kubuntu turns on by default uses around 60MB RAM
[none]	[16:07]	<nitalaut>	it boots fine with integradetd video
[none]	[16:07]	<xsacha>	stemount: gnome is using 400MB for me and kde uses 180MB when im using kubuntu

[none]	[16:07]	<xsacha>	jessie^^: i have same memory usage as you
[none]	[16:07]	<stemount>	xsacha, thats because you have gnome libraries loaded too i guess?

[none]	[16:07]	<xsacha>	stemount: how do i not have gnome libraries?
[positive]	[16:07]	<nemo_home>	jdong: my laptop with 96MiB of memory runs XFCE4 :)
[none]	[16:07]	<LjL>	xsacha: uhm there are some igns but i'm not sure that should be an issue itself
[none]	[16:07]	<nemo_home>	jdong: uses GTK, but not gnome
[none]	[16:07]	<jdong>	nemo_home: that's an option too; but IMO after DT_GNU_HASH in Feisty KDE is significantly faster than XFCE4 on old hardware....
[none]	[16:08]	<Op3r>	for those who are having problems with upgrading to gutsy, upgrade your system first then it will prompt you to upgrade to gutsy
[none]	[16:08]	<jessie^^>	xsacha, so the buffers line is really what i should be looking at to determine actual memory used?
[negative]	[16:08]	<stemount>	xsacha, KDE was 300mb+ compared to gnome 150mb :/
[positive]	[16:08]	<jdong>	nemo_home: of course, if you like GNOME apps.... KDE is pretty useless :)

[none]	[16:08]	<jdong>	stemount: whoa, KDE is 300mb+??
[none]	[16:08]	<nemo_home>	KDE and GNOME are both memory hogs in their own way

[none]	[16:08]	<nemo_home>	jdong: well, fact is, simply more apps I like are GTK based. on 96MiB of memory didn't want to load both Qt and GTK
[none]	[16:08]	<nemo_home>	jdong: so I picked one
[none]	[16:08]	<xsacha>	stemount: what did you have to do?

[none]	[16:08]	<nemo_home>	jdong: XFCE4 can apparently use Qt too

[none]	[16:09]	<Draggin>	Ola! I need some assistance with MySQL, PHP and Apache in Ubuntu... For some reason, almost none of them seem to be listed in the Add/Remove utility.

[none]	[16:10]	<jdong>	stemount: if you load GNOME and start Firefox, it uses another 50MB RAM. If you load KDE and start Konqueror, it uses like 500KB extra.
[none]	[16:10]	<nemo_home>	jdong: now the one KDE app that wins, hands down.  k3b.

[none]	[18:10]	<bugiam>	using fresh install of ubuntu gutsy 7.10 64-bits.. got a HP ati-card (Radeon x1700SE 512MB). using restricted manager to active ati-drivers just gives me black screen on boot, any tips?
[none]	[18:10]	<julian_>	"Fryguy--, are you familiar with a linux version of mlisp?  we're instructed to use mlisp on some Solaris boxes, but I'd prefer to work on my local system.  I was able to find the package ""cl-umlisp"", but no compiler"

[none]	[18:10]	<aata>	nickrud?
[none]	[18:10]	<flick>	warkruid, thanks i will look up on that on the net
[none]	[18:10]	<Fryguy-->	julian_: are you sure you need a compiler? Not many versions/dialects of lisp actually compile to machine code.  The only one I can think of off the top of my head is gambit-c
[none]	[18:10]	<nickrud>	slaytanic: about the backup? yes. A sec, and aata I'll find a link
[none]	[18:10]	<pommer>	what is the best cd burner for linux? i need to burn a iso image
[none]	[18:10]	<napster>	Fryguy: i just put in an internal drive 2 back my data up 2 but it wont let me put anything on it
[none]	[18:11]	<amun>	how do i get alsa to use the plugsurround51 ? I understand the aplay -D command, but how do i get it to use it, for example, in xmms, or amarok, or other audio players?

[none]	[18:11]	<Fryguy-->	napster: is it mounted?
[none]	[18:11]	<julian_>	Fryguy--, no idea.  I know nothing at all about lisp.
[none]	[18:11]	<Pelo>	anyone know how to make the emblems bigger ?
[positive]	[18:11]	<aata>	thanks a mil :)
[positive]	[18:11]	<flick>	warkruid, now that i know what to look for, i think i will find out a way :)
[positive]	[18:11]	<vocx>	Lars_G, I assume you read the release notes that said something that dual head lost support in xinerama or something. I have no experience I just read that.
[none]	[18:11]	<stian>	hello everyone, someone who know of a program that can copy a color from my screen and tell me the collor code in hex ?
[none]	[18:11]	<warkruid>	flick: or start that bittorrent client on the background with low priority
[none]	[18:11]	<nickrud>	slaytanic: yes, read that bug report, it's really long and detailed
[none]	[18:11]	<Fryguy-->	julian_: well where are you getting the thought that you require a compiler?
[none]	[18:11]	<napster>	i think so...i can c its contents but i cant write 2 it
[none]	[18:11]	<julian_>	Fryguy--, I guess it wouldn't be compiled, but rather interpreted
[none]	[18:11]	<jnc>	"pommer: k3b is my favorite GUI app for doing this, but otherwise you'd just do ""cdrecord file.iso"""
[none]	[18:11]	<Fryguy-->	napster: and how did you mount it?

[none]	[18:11]	<Traveler6>	im outta here
[none]	[18:11]	<flick>	warkruid the second approach perhaps will not work... since even on low priority it takes up all my bandwidth (256 kbits/s)
[none]	[18:11]	<napster>	Fryguy: i didnt. i just double clicked on it

[none]	[18:21]	<Fryguy-->	pommer: of course it's worth installing, if not for all of the various updates to programs
[positive]	[18:21]	<nickrud>	aata: 1. do the get command. 2. burn that, and /var/cache/apt/archives/* to a cd. 3. Install. 4. copy the files back to /var/cache/apt/archives on the new install. 5. run the set command on the mypackages file. 6. Watch your system update, without downloading :)

[none]	[18:22]	<Fryguy-->	lgc__: why not try exaile's channel, since this isn't an ubuntu problem
[none]	[18:22]	<murkyMurk>	riotkittie: just wondered if an update had caused mayhem...apparently not
[none]	[18:22]	<nickrud>	aata: that's assuming you'll want to get from the net; if the package is already in the cache, it won't redownload them
[none]	[18:22]	<aata>	okay so first

[none]	[18:23]	<Pelo>	Dialntone, could be , open synaptic and install every single  gstreamer0.10 packages you see
[none]	[18:23]	<selfsearcher[]>	I have a problem with Gusty + DHCP

[none]	[18:23]	<newguy>	just tried update manager now, no updates available
[none]	[18:24]	<Pelo>	selfsearcher[],  if you upgraded , I had a problem with nm applet not seeing my connection , I had to redo pppoeconf for it to work properly
[none]	[18:24]	<Fryguy-->	aantn: not really, can't really convert rasterized to vectorized
[none]	[18:24]	<newguy>	i did update some stuff couple hours ago that were related to OO
[positive]	[18:24]	<riotkittie>	the one time i have noticed compiz-fusion slowing to a crawl on my end, it was due to the animations. but my graphics card sucks. :D
[none]	[18:24]	<murkyMurk>	aata: yeah, gimp'll do it
[none]	[18:24]	<nickrud>	newguy: erm, nm, I read too far back. Did you tell the update manager to check?

[none]	[18:24]	<newguy>	i clicked check
[none]	[18:24]	<joanki1>	i'm trying to listen to a windows media player video online.... it won't do it - how do i get it to work?
[none]	[18:24]	<Pelo>	newguy, check in synaptic under filters see if you have any broken packages , if not , reintsall the OOo packages
[none]	[18:24]	<aantn>	Fryguy--: can't flash do it?

[none]	[18:24]	<doodle77>	i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not near my router. any idea what's wrong?

[none]	[18:24]	<_pirinto_>	Hi, has anyone here had any issues on saving files created on office2007 on a samba share? I've only found a few solutions on the net and they don't seem to apply. I'm running Gutsy Gibbon
[none]	[18:24]	<nickrud>	hey Pelo haven't seen you for a while
[none]	[18:25]	<Pelo>	joanki1,  you need mozilla-mplayer probably it works for some
[negative]	[18:25]	<rambo3>	joanki1: mplayer mms://
[none]	[18:25]	<Fryguy-->	aantn: not really, by rasterizing an image, you are losing the data that allows the image to be freely scaled up or down
[none]	[18:25]	<aata>	so lets get this straight. i get a package list with dpkg --get-selections > ~/my-packages. i copy that, along with the contents of /foo/moo/archives/* to a cd. i then copy the /foo/moo/archives/* to the one on the new install. i then run the sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade. about right?
[none]	[18:25]	<murkyMurk>	riotkittie: I've turned animations off as they were getting slow. Dunno, maybe a reboot..i suppose it is still beta ware#
[none]	[18:25]	<cycore>	does no one know how to crop pdf pages?
[none]	[18:25]	<Pelo>	nickrud, got a new job, I get home tired, and I donT' feel like dealing with this channel most night
[none]	[18:25]	<lgc__>	Fryguy--, thanks, I'm on the channel now. It's just that there's always someone telling you you're doing something 'unappropriate' on this channel.
[none]	[18:25]	<aantn>	Fryguy--: I'd like to vectorize a raster
[none]	[18:25]	<selfsearcher[]>	Pelo: the strange thing is: I didn't upgrade and kubuntu (installed after ubuntu) works well... don't know why but GNOME has problems. I have to restart my connection (router with DHCP)
[none]	[18:25]	<nickrud>	aata: yup
[none]	[18:25]	<aata>	awesome will try
[none]	[18:25]	<nickrud>	Pelo: congrats
[none]	[18:25]	<Pelo>	selfsearcher[], I'm stumpped then
[none]	[18:25]	<Fryguy-->	lgc__: mostly because the vast majority of this channel is
[none]	[18:25]	<aata>	ill inform you if it works.
[none]	[18:26]	<aata>	thanks a mil even if it doesnt
[none]	[18:26]	<riotkittie>	murkyMurk: restarting X alone might do as much as a reboot.
[none]	[18:26]	<kst->	are the CD isos being updated regularly btw? or will they stay the same from first release on?
[negative]	[18:26]	<doodle77>	aantn: http://potrace.sf.net
[positive]	[18:26]	<nickrud>	:)
[none]	[18:26]	<lgc__>	Fryguy--, unappropriate?
[negative]	[18:26]	<selfsearcher[]>	Well, in the end KDE part is working good. Maybe the problem is with the GNOME Connection Manager :\
[none]	[18:26]	<YOgui666>	hmmmm...

[none]	[18:26]	<fuligin>	i take it many ppl are having probmes ???

[none]	[18:27]	<YOgui666>	but can i install the conection manager of Kde in gnome¿
[none]	[18:27]	<fuligin>	anyone know how to deal with apci ??
[none]	[18:27]	<Pelo>	kst-, unless there is a massive amount of updated  they should stay the same until the next release ie 6 months
[none]	[18:27]	<Paddy_EIRE>	lgc__, just keep it clean and you'll be fine
[none]	[18:27]	<britt_>	where are mouse settings stored?

[negative]	[18:28]	<A1f422>	Ever since I upgraded to gutsy, sound is no longer working in Wine. Wine is set to use alsa for sound output. Under feisty I was already using PulseAudio and Wine was happy enough talking to it via ALSA. Now wine spews this mess into the console when I run winecfg and the sound test fails: http://pastebin.com/m34feffc9 . Sound is working with Amarok, aplay, etc. Any ideas or further debugging advice?
[none]	[18:28]	<riotkittie>	no, that'd be madness
[none]	[18:28]	<Pelo>	selfsearcher[], try redoing the setup for the connection , ei make a new one
[none]	[18:28]	<lgc__>	"Paddy_EIRE, that's what I say: many people here are most concerned with ""keeping it clean"" than with offering any help (not exactly your case, Fryguy-- )."

[none]	[18:28]	<vocx>	nickrud, aata strangely, one day before gutsy the channel was to its usual 1090
[none]	[18:28]	<selfsearcher[]>	Pelo: make a new one? How?
[none]	[18:28]	<Pelo>	riotkittie, new distro,  strictly FOSS , not commercial repos or restricted stuff
[none]	[18:28]	<Paddy_EIRE>	lgc__, keeping it clean is easy.. as is getting help
[none]	[18:29]	<fuligin>	can anyone suggest if its better loading 7.04 rather then 2.10
[none]	[18:29]	<fuligin>	7.10
[none]	[18:29]	<Pelo>	selfsearcher[], menu > system > admin > network
[none]	[18:29]	<YOgui666>	gobunut, it`s a kind of basic linux to make mods and create your own linux version

[none]	[18:29]	<bulmer>	has it been worth its while, upgrading in the most recent one?  seems like major problem to lots..
[none]	[18:29]	<britt_>	i need to know where mouse tracking (speed) settings are stored for X
[none]	[18:29]	<doodle77>	i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not near my router. any idea what's wrong?
[none]	[18:29]	<dbzdeath>	hey i'm trying to use uvesafb but i cannot get it to work and i believe it is  because when i add the v86d into the initramfs in the kernel config ubuntu doesn't include it or something could anyone help me please?
[none]	[18:29]	<Jabberwock>	Is this black&white thing new in ubuntu 7.10?
[none]	[18:29]	<Dreamglider>	has anyone had problems installing Ubuntu 7.04 and/or 7.10 on a dell inspiron 9400 ?
[none]	[18:29]	<vocx>	A1f422, check launchpad for bugs in wine in the new release.
[none]	[18:29]	<Jabberwock>	When FireFox is loading a page the window goes black&white

[none]	[18:29]	<Jabberwock>	Same with banshee
[none]	[18:29]	<Jabberwock>	It's sort of annoying
[none]	[18:29]	<noobuntu>	does anyone use virtualbox in ubuntu?
[none]	[18:30]	<vocx>	nickrud, how?!
[none]	[18:30]	<selfsearcher[]>	"Pelo: just done it few hours ago. It seems that Connection Managers needs something called ""roaming""... don't know if this is the problem. Feisty worked flawlessy"
[none]	[18:30]	<garu>	noobuntu yep
[none]	[18:30]	<pommer>	stupid question maybe... but is slackware better the ubuntu??
[none]	[18:30]	<jared>	I installed nvidia-glx-new...when I am dpkg-reconfig xserver-xorg, will it be nv or nvidia?
[none]	[18:30]	<nickrud>	fuligin: depends on a lot of stuff. For some people sticking with 7.04 is better, others upgrading is better.
[none]	[18:30]	<A1f422>	vocx: okay, thanks
[none]	[18:30]	<tehlaser>	noobuntu, yes
[none]	[18:30]	<schulenberg>	hi
[none]	[18:30]	<bulmer>	riotkittie: in the past 3 days, most issues has been the upgrade didnt do well..
[none]	[18:30]	<warkruid>	pommer: not better, different
[none]	[18:30]	<IdleOne>	pommer: yes and no depends who you ask
[none]	[18:30]	<nickrud>	vocx: user count. lasted about 3 seconds
[none]	[18:30]	<selfsearcher[]>	pommer: more customizable, maybe
[none]	[18:30]	<fuligin>	nickrud, im doing a new install, havent fully used either
[none]	[18:30]	<aata>	because, vocx, people hadnt yet witnessed the wrath of an improperly executed upgrade
[none]	[18:30]	<Fryguy-->	how can I use artwiz and other console fonts in gnome-terminal?
[none]	[18:30]	<riotkittie>	pommer: it depends on your needs, your taste. i wouldn't say better. i'd say different. each are excellent distros with their own merits
[none]	[18:31]	<warkruid>	pommer: you can customize it easier, Slackware that is..
[none]	[18:31]	<vocx>	noobuntu, there is a new subforum in ubuntuforums.org regarding virtualization now. Read the stickies. Very complete information.
[none]	[18:31]	<aata>	***aata laughs in the face of the ubuntu-devil and tells him to bring it on
[none]	[18:31]	<Paddy_EIRE>	pommer, not recomended unless you're an advances linux user
[positive]	[18:31]	<Fryguy-->	noobuntu: speaking of virtualbox, I'd highly recommend qemu over virtualbox from my research and experience
[none]	[18:31]	<Paddy_EIRE>	pommer, stick with ubuntu
[none]	[18:31]	<newguy>	damnit!!! i just reinstalled OO and its still the same thing happening! which is nothing! it wont even bloody start ..
[none]	[18:31]	<Pelo>	selfsearcher[], like I said when I started,  the network manager applet seems to have problems recognising connection stuff from previous versions when you upgrade, I had to redo my connection stuff m anualy and reboot for it to work properly,  it was affecting other apps as well, even tho I was actualy connected
[none]	[18:31]	<schulenberg>	can somebody recommend a graphical user editor for GRUB? I have just installed startup manager .. as a recommondation out of this channel, but it is not possible to add my DOS 6.22 Partition?
[none]	[18:31]	<lgc__>	"Paddy_EIRE, that's what I mean by ""purism"". So many folks here refering to the etiquette, or the official topic, or the language or whatever... they just increase the traffic unnecessarily. Real ""offenders"" are not so common."
[none]	[18:31]	<warkruid>	pommer: have to agree with Paddy_EIRE
[none]	[18:31]	<nickrud>	fuligin: I can say that if you have recent ati, and want the compiz desktop, and have a laptop, stick with 7.04. Harder to install, but suspend works
[none]	[18:31]	<bulmer>	Fryguy--: why so? i have not used either yet..
[positive]	[18:31]	<fuligin>	nikrud:both have apci problems, so very long tim eto start up
[negative]	[18:31]	<kst->	how do I setup my s-video output to TV (pal-b) with ati fglrx on gutsy? anything special? my former solution from feisty got broken with the upgrade :(
[none]	[18:31]	<riotkittie>	bulmer: people who have had no problems with the upgrade typically dont come to support channels to announce that things are great.
[none]	[18:31]	<schulenberg>	thx in advance
[none]	[18:31]	<tehlaser>	Fryguy: Really?  I've always had performance problems with qemu...

[none]	[18:32]	<vega->	what's the difference between the -386 and -generic kernel in gutsy? (-generic boot fails on my system, -386 is ok)
[none]	[18:32]	<bulmer>	riotkittie: i hope they do and help out the rest thats struggling with the upgrade
[none]	[18:32]	<noobuntu>	Fryguy--, why is that?
[none]	[18:32]	<selfsearcher[]>	Pelo: so if I use, say, KUbuntu (installed via Synaptic) I have this problem no more
[negative]	[18:32]	<nickrud>	riotkittie: yeah, most don't even know to come here ;(
[none]	[18:32]	<Fryguy-->	tehlaser: using /dev/kqemu makes it use the virtualization tech in my processor and run at 100% native speed
[none]	[18:32]	<tehlaser>	both kqemu and kvm give me stability issues...
[none]	[18:32]	<fuligin>	nikrud, so i guess i should stick to 7.04
[none]	[18:32]	<TFrog>	anyone here an ATI proprietary driver specialist?
[none]	[18:32]	<tehlaser>	maybe I've just got funky hardware.
[none]	[18:32]	<lgc__>	Paddy_EIRE, maybe you strictly abide by the rules. But you don't need to stay long to watch someone scold someone else for their 'improper' behaviour.

[none]	[18:33]	<Pelo>	selfsearcher[], as far as a know the nm applet is part of gnome ( and that is the buggy bit) , so I guess kubuntu doesn'T have the problem
[none]	[18:33]	<nickrud>	fuligin: I'm rassling with it, maybe soon I can put something on the wiki that no one here will support
[none]	[18:33]	<niwt>	vega-: generic kernel has smp enabled, and I don't know what else

[positive]	[18:34]	<fuligin>	envy does wonders even for newbies like me :)
[none]	[18:34]	<noobuntu>	Fryguy--, can you run freedos or minix3 in qemu with everything working and without errors?
[none]	[18:34]	<aata>	what about a boot partition
[none]	[18:34]	<Fryguy-->	noobuntu: no idea, haven't tried
[none]	[18:34]	<schulenberg>	can somebody recommend a graphical user editor for GRUB? I have just installed startup manager .. as a recommondation out of this channel, but it is not possible to add my DOS 6.22 Partition?
[none]	[18:34]	<ali110>	hi i just installed ubuntu 7.10 ( i am a sort of noob to linux)  it asked me if i want to install ATI display card property driver and i accepted after restart now i cant make my resolution any bigger than 800 * 600 what went wrong and how i cant correct this ???
[none]	[18:34]	<warkruid>	pommer: why the question about Slackware?
[none]	[18:34]	<tehlaser>	freedos works fine for me.
[none]	[18:34]	<newguy>	ok, whomelese is having problems with Open Office? i just reinstalled, yet its not starting up
[positive]	[18:34]	<nickrud>	aata: yes, for experimenting. If you plan on putting much music or video on it, you make your home another partition and much bigger
[none]	[18:34]	<vega->	seems also -generic is tickless while -386 is not
[positive]	[18:34]	<Fryguy-->	noobuntu: my advice to you would be to experiment to see which suits your needs the best
[none]	[18:34]	<lgc__>	"Paddy_EIRE, on the other hand, take #debian, for example: it has as much traffic as this channel, and nobody raises an eyebrow when someone says ""f*ck!"" or whatever 4-letter word they please."
[none]	[18:34]	<Paddy_EIRE>	lgc__, why whats the problem anyway
[negative]	[18:34]	<TFrog>	"i'm having an issue with the ATI proprietary drivers. i followed the instructions here ->http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Gutsy_Installation_GuideP and when i type fglrxinfo i get Xlib: extension ""XFree86-DRI"" missing on display "":0.0""."
[none]	[18:34]	<Fryguy-->	how can I use console fonts in gnome-terminal?
[none]	[18:35]	<vocx>	Fryguy--, you should give your opinions in the new virtualization subforum, if you haven't done already. Also, it might be useful to point what is better for a new user and what for an advanced user or business.
[none]	[18:35]	<Paddy_EIRE>	!offtopic | lgc__

[none]	[18:35]	<schulenberg>	thx!!
[none]	[18:35]	<Paddy_EIRE>	lgc__, whats the technical problem anyhow
[none]	[18:35]	<tehlaser>	alill0: Go to system, administration, screens... and try some of the settings there.  The second tab has driver stuff in it.
[none]	[18:35]	<Pelo>	whonicca,  you can only upgrade to the next release in the series
[none]	[18:35]	<Fryguy-->	whonicca: IIRC you have to upgrade to feisty first, then to gutsy
[none]	[18:35]	<nickrud>	aantn: 10, yes.

[none]	[18:36]	<atouk>	it seems like if root login is enabled, sudo doesn't work for users.    is there a fix?

[none]	[18:37]	<Pelo>	later folks
[none]	[18:37]	<riotkittie>	yes. the fix is not enabling root. tsk tsk. <hides>
[none]	[18:37]	<nickrud>	atouk: that is not true.
[none]	[18:37]	<ckw>	TFrog:OK...i have an older card but i am still having issues with getting the proprietary driver functioning as well

[none]	[18:37]	<troxor>	atouk: in there, you can specify exactly who gets to use sudo
[none]	[18:37]	<vocx>	atouk, sudo works for those in the sudoers file in the admin group, something like that.
[none]	[18:37]	<doodle77>	i got my wireless card working but it's not working as well as it used to (under windows). It loses the connection when i'm not near my router. any idea what's wrong?
[none]	[18:37]	<aata>	nickrud just tell me this. my install partition mounts on / with bootable flag off, and my boot partition mounts on /boot with bootable flag on, right?
[none]	[18:37]	<murkyMurk>	joanki: really, the divx plugin is ace
[none]	[18:38]	<stemount>	doodle77, whats the wireless card?
[none]	[18:38]	<nickrud>	aata: sure, that's fine

[none]	[18:38]	<aata>	awesome thanks nickrud, again
[none]	[18:38]	<TFrog>	ckw, i just installed 7.10 so i may end up reloading and going back to the Mesa driver. it's not bad on glxgears. i get around 1215fps but the proprietary driver under fiesty was getting around 1700fps
[none]	[18:38]	<lgc__>	nickrud, we'd probably ask there about that, I fancy (and still, adults use 4-letter words quite normally). Bottom line is, if you want to get attention on #ubuntu, just break the etiquette or argue against it! See, I've already have gotten responses from about 4 people already, and only one of them offered technical help!
[none]	[18:38]	<atouk>	hot to disable root logins once enabled?
[none]	[18:38]	<atouk>	(how)
[none]	[18:39]	<doodle77>	else: why would ndiswrapper have a stronger connection than bcm43xx?
[none]	[18:39]	<nickrud>	lgc__: cuz we care about this not turning into a flame fest? But I'm dropping this now
[none]	[18:39]	<ali110>	tehlaser: i will try but once before trying things like that on fedora made my screen show me the booting but when linux start it the monitor turns off if that happened what i should do ? ( cause then i wont be able to come to chat and ask the question)
[none]	[18:39]	<DevideZero>	riotkittie , yes and i have found link in ubuntu.com site to gobuntu and its only page there isnt site for gubuntu. . . so im asking here there is official gobuntu site ? ( like edubuntu.org .. . ) ?
[none]	[18:39]	<niwt>	aata: you don't need to bootable flag unless you want grub installed into a partition rather than into the mbr

[none]	[18:39]	<vocx>	doodle77, most wireless drivers have issues because they are reverse-engineered. I think this is known for Broadcom. Look at their web page.
[positive]	[18:39]	<troxor>	atouk: sudo -i to get to the root user's account, make up a really long random password, set it, and then forget it :)

[none]	[18:40]	<ckw>	TFrog:yeah its a real pain in the ass to get these drivers workin...but a challenge as well....from what i can gather here and on other chats there are a lot of issues that are cropping up
[none]	[18:40]	<kiru>	i have about 250GB of mp3s which kills the performance of this player
[none]	[18:40]	<murkyMurk>	marina: google cedega
[none]	[18:40]	<kiru>	any suggestions?
[none]	[18:40]	<CruX>	hello all
[none]	[18:40]	<aata>	troxor what you trying to do? sounds funny
[none]	[18:40]	<kiru>	i dont find anything in the forums
[none]	[18:40]	<Fryguy-->	kiru: strange, my collection is upwards of 800gb and there's no slowdown at all
[positive]	[18:40]	<octo_>	now that the kernel shows IDE drives as SCSI, how can you be sure that DMA is working on an IDE drive.  hdparm tells me HDIO_GET_DMA failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device?
[none]	[18:40]	<ckw>	one thing that got me moving forward was to download newer linux drivers from the ATI/AMD site
[none]	[18:40]	<vocx>	marina, don't try to get attention.    Anyway, there is a whole subforum about games in ubuntuforums.org and also a Games Arena.
[positive]	[18:40]	<troxor>	aata: just answering questions :)
[none]	[18:40]	<marina>	thank you
[none]	[18:40]	<CruX>	how i can set properly default disk io scheduler for all disks to anticipatory in /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler ?
[none]	[18:40]	<jrib>	!root > atouk
[none]	[18:40]	<kiru>	Fryguy--: how do i delete this bibliothek?
[none]	[18:40]	<ali110>	i will try to  change my monitor driver and resolution to make it better but once before trying things like that on fedora made my screen show me the booting but when linux start it the monitor turns off if that happened what i should do ? ( cause then i wont be able to come to chat and ask the question)
[none]	[18:41]	<murkyMurk>	kiru: i would gues at ~/.banshee
[none]	[18:41]	<riotkittie>	lgc__: people arent always going to have answers to your questions, and those that do might not be able to give them to you immediately.
[positive]	[18:41]	<Fryguy-->	nickrud: it's a multi-disk raid array, have fun with that
[none]	[18:41]	<ckw>	TFrog:also there are some newer drivers due out soon that may solve a lot of this
[none]	[18:41]	<kiru>	Fryguy--: i think it is because the music is stored on an external drive
[none]	[18:41]	<kst->	any ideas how I put my svideo connected TV as 2nd monitor with this displayconfig-gtk thing? what do I select? (PAL-B standard)
[none]	[18:41]	<TFrog>	ckw, well i hope they are resolved soon. i hear AMD/ATI are going to go full open source with their new drivers for the newest card. we can only hope it trickles backwards for the older cards as well
[positive]	[18:41]	<nickrud>	Fryguy--: doable. I'll mail you a bunch of dvd's :)
[none]	[18:41]	<Fryguy-->	kiru: I read my music collection over a network
[none]	[18:41]	<kiru>	Fryguy--: there is no .banshee
[none]	[18:41]	<lgc__>	nickrud, I agree to that. Let me finish by saying that there is no flame fest when there's no bigotry. That said, I thank you and all the fine people who responded to my queries. And I drop the subject now.
[none]	[18:41]	<tehlaser>	"alill0: gutsy has ""bulletproof"" X, basically a fallback if you goof things up too bad.  Your biggest risk is accidentally configuring a dual-output video card or laptop to use the wrong output.  That can be fixed by moving the cable to the other port, possibly requiring an adapter for VGA->DVI compatibility."
[none]	[18:42]	<ckw>	TFrog:i was finally able to get the driver going and the extended desktop to the second monitor but now things like mythtv and celestia are just dog slow
[none]	[18:42]	<TFrog>	ckw, i tried the 8.41.x beta drivers once. they should be out soon. hopefully they will resolve this issue
[none]	[18:42]	<Paddy_EIRE>	lgc__, could you take this to the offtopic or try again later
[none]	[18:42]	<nickrud>	kiru: banshee keeps it in ~/.config/banshee

[none]	[18:43]	<TFrog>	i believe that is what is going on here as well
[none]	[18:43]	<Fryguy-->	Dreamglider: it's messing up autodetection.  You'll just have to go and edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file manually
[none]	[18:43]	<garu>	Hazler world of warcraft works in ubuntu, so, guld wars should also work

[positive]	[18:44]	<ompaul>	aata, the use of * does not disguise the need for you to avoid the word fully in irc - you should have checked that also :)

[none]	[19:01]	<jlilly>	FOAD, I might consider commenting out the option metamodes line
[none]	[19:01]	<Paddy_EIRE_>	Ajzo, that save function in mplayer firefox is for when the video is fully buffered/downloaded, so instead of it being removed in the firefox tmp folder it gets placed wherever you like.. or do the wget method which is far better
[none]	[19:01]	<Ashex>	Ajzo, that's where you want to change it's action from playing to download

[none]	[19:12]	<end0r57>	hmm i thought demonoid was down
[none]	[19:12]	<kriel>	troxor: the one thing i dislike about linux is that it's hard to start. it's like trying to find an edge to pry up. once you get one piece free, it's a lot easier to work from there and learn more and more, but getting that first piece free and learned is hard.
[none]	[19:12]	<DerDritte>	Is there a way to igorne certain file types from getting into the lib in amarok?

[none]	[20:20]	<pubuntu>	i haven't yet istalled
[none]	[20:20]	<trident523>	sco50000, Genotrius: Sounds like an error in X, or a graphics card.
[none]	[20:20]	<Fryguy-->	pubuntu: probably
[none]	[20:21]	<beni>	pubuntu: in the setup there is an option for this
[none]	[20:21]	<k5ehx>	after an upgrade my 3d desktop effects (desktop on a cube) are turned off. How do I turn this back on?
[none]	[20:21]	<kondor101>	says 7.10 here on my mums PC, but i know she hasn't done a proper upgrade, she still has gaim for a start not pidgin, any ideas?
[none]	[20:21]	<Fethman>	is there any keyboard to send a forground program to the background
[none]	[20:21]	<astro76>	pubuntu, yes use a partition tool like we said to shrink your windows partition to the desired size, then just install Ubuntu into the remaining free space
[positive]	[20:21]	<m1r>	john117 ,rest of space :)
[none]	[20:21]	<trident523>	k5ehx: system -> preferences -> desktop effects
[none]	[20:21]	<pubuntu>	but i want to increase the windows partition size
[none]	[20:21]	<FotoPhocus>	John117:  I would say 100gb is more than plenty for Ubuntu.  Maybe even get away with 60
[none]	[20:21]	<rypaint>	could anyone walk me though troubleshooting no sound?
[none]	[20:21]	<murkyMurk>	vsayikiran: yep, we can always change back later and it can hardly be slower can it?

[none]	[20:21]	<Suchthefool>	anyone willing to help someone out who cant get his wireless working on 7.10?

[none]	[20:21]	<trident523>	k5ehx: odd, does 3d work?

[none]	[20:22]	<Genotrius>	trident: I've actually stopped X, I've got a big terminal screen now. We can rule out the graphics card I think; it worked fine before I upgraded.

[none]	[20:23]	<k5ehx>	trident523: don't know. The problem isn't that 3d doesn't work, it's that the spinning desktop thing isn't configured.
[none]	[20:23]	<John117>	m1r okay, thanks.  What is a good program to allow ntfs read/right no ubuntu?
[none]	[20:23]	<trident523>	sco50000: ati is a known bug currently, see the known bugs page. (I had a fightwith it this moring.)

[none]	[20:23]	<astro76>	Fethman, yeah then you need screen
[none]	[20:23]	<trident523>	k5ehx: run glxgears from the terminal.

[none]	[20:24]	<beni>	pubuntu: how come?
[none]	[20:24]	<k5ehx>	yeah, trident523. I just need to figure out what package it is, I think. THanks for your help, I'll do more googling
[none]	[20:24]	<Fryguy-->	it's one of the big newbie-enhancements of 7.10
[none]	[20:24]	<BHSPitLappy>	pubuntu, that's a terrible ratio
[none]	[20:24]	<sco50000>	pubuntu: that's exactly what i did
[none]	[20:24]	<pubuntu>	why terrible?
[none]	[20:24]	<John117>	m1r well... all of my external drives are in NTFS
[none]	[20:24]	<pubuntu>	what heppened when you did it?
[positive]	[20:25]	<FotoPhocus>	I'm installing Ubuntu tomorrow night when I get my new PC built.  I've got a 400gb hard drive and 200gb hard drive.  400 will go to XP, pics, music, etc.  The other drive will go to Ubuntu
[none]	[20:25]	<beni>	pubuntu: because the majority of the code would be buggy as hell
[none]	[20:25]	<Jban>	Fryguy--: What was the non-newbie way... ?
[none]	[20:25]	<sco50000>	pubuntu:it worked fine
[none]	[20:25]	<John117>	m1r no, i won't access the ubuntu partition from windows.. is that what you mean?
[none]	[20:25]	<beni>	pubuntu: Just boot windows.. *rr*

[none]	[20:25]	<Fryguy-->	FotoPhocus: sounds like you are wasting a lot of space
[none]	[20:25]	<trident523>	wirechief1: I ended up having to fix mine by fixing a display error.

[none]	[20:25]	<FotoPhocus>	Could be, but I don't have anything else to do with it
[none]	[20:25]	<John117>	m1r okay.. What is the name of the file system that Linux uses?
[none]	[20:25]	<wirechief1>	trident523: i used the script from kanotix
[none]	[20:26]	<FotoPhocus>	I had a 200gb first, and the 400gb I got on special for $100
[none]	[20:26]	<BHSPitLappy>	FotoPhocus, give me the 200GB, and partition the 400GB
[none]	[20:26]	<pubuntu>	what should be the proper ratio on my 160gb HD if i'm a primary windows user?
[none]	[20:26]	<m1r>	john117, u have many, ubuntu uses ext3
[none]	[20:26]	<trident523>	"sco50000: People with ATI display adapters may get a blank screen when loading X due to the driver being unable to initialize certain hardware.

[none]	[20:26]	<Fryguy-->	FotoPhocus: you should make a like 50gb windows partition, 15gb ubuntu/swap, and make the rest be separate data partitions so it's easier to work with

[none]	[21:37]	<astro76>	Tranto1, you could use partimage to image your disk

[none]	[21:42]	<tony>	thedonvaughn: Okay, so does it matter that my old IDE drive is h0 in the BIOS and SDA in my Ubuntu setup? It's empty. The problem is that whenever I have a kernel upgrade, I have to go into /boot/grub/menu.lst and change it up to get Ubuntu to load.
[none]	[21:42]	<Joshooa>	I get some desktop effects but no matter what no cube, once I had a flat screen i could flip over but that's gone now too

[none]	[21:42]	<jnc>	Tranto1: oh.   if you boot a SysRescCd or similar live cd distro, you can mount your partitions and backup the information from them.  You can just do a full gzip compressed disk image, a tarball, or whatever.  Tar at least knows how to preserve file permissions if you tell it to

[none]	[21:48]	<riotkittie>	Tranto1: what did you do, go with primary partitions all the way? :o
[none]	[21:48]	<MasterShrek>	Tranto1, riotkittie makes a good point, install gutsy alongside and then u can copy configurations and stuff over until you are happy with it, then get rid of feisty later
[none]	[21:48]	<pieisgood4589>	7.10 is still buggy

[none]	[21:49]	<jnc>	Tranto1: there's nothing too special about a linux setup. Files with permissions on ext3 filesystem, sockets, device nodes. Then you want to have some way to chroot into that after restoring the data and run grub to install it to the MBR

[none]	[21:51]	<riotkittie>	akorn: you need to compile compiz. from GIT.
[none]	[21:51]	<Ashex>	neopsyche, so add them into /etc/fstab, you can copy the one for root when making the others

[none]	[22:32]	<slackern>	oxeimon, it'll probably be like 6months till they get to the 3d parts of it, could be more or less i really don't know, you could ask in #radeonhd which is the development channel for the driver

[none]	[23:12]	<ChrisC35>	RAID1 is the best for backup's sake
[none]	[23:12]	<arooni_>	where do i go in gutsy to tell it to auto index my /home directory?

[none]	[23:14]	<foug>	Is upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10 the same as installing from a 7.10 CD? Will there be any differences in repo's or anything? Will stuff from 7.04 be carried over?
[none]	[23:14]	<Innomen>	MasterShrek: may i suggest that you write a tutorial for how to do this in english and post it somewhere? you're very effective.
[none]	[23:14]	<Fryguy-->	ChrisC35: eh. It's ok.  IMO you should be doing proper backups, and if you care about raid for the purpose of raid (redunant data), then raid5 is a better solution
[none]	[23:14]	<threeseas>	I can get it up in failsafe gnome mode but can't do much
[none]	[23:14]	<pulseezar>	urgentness!

[none]	[23:14]	<MasterShrek>	Innomen, the instructions are on medibuntu's website
[none]	[23:14]	<ubuntu_Iz>	anyone have a second to answer an xorg driver question?
[none]	[23:14]	<Fryguy-->	and using raid on an OS install isn't really recommended because if/when things go wrong it becomes somewhat difficult to actually pull data off of the array
[none]	[23:14]	<Fryguy-->	end0r57: it does, just fine
[none]	[23:14]	<The_Joe_>	I finally got sound on my Acer Aspire 3050, however whenever I load a Flash movie the sound suddenly stops
[none]	[23:14]	<ChrisC35>	Fryguy-- raid1 is safer than raid5
[none]	[23:14]	<riotkittie>	foug: when you install from a CD, you get a clean instal. when you upgrade, your data/settings/ is maintained.
[none]	[23:14]	<The_Joe_>	I need to restart X to get it back again
[none]	[23:14]	<faiaookami>	What about cssm?
[none]	[23:14]	<Flannel>	foug: There wont be differences, except youll still have everything you already installed (and it will be upgraded)
[none]	[23:14]	<d4rkmonkey>	foug updating to 7.10 will just keep all your files that you have right now, and upgrade all programs/repos. Installing from CD you'll have to copy over your files and stuff
[none]	[23:14]	<Innomen>	MasterShrek: in greek
[none]	[23:14]	<faiaookami>	Is that what I'm looking for?
[none]	[23:15]	<Innomen>	MasterShrek: if i knew enough to use those, i wouldent need them

[none]	[23:15]	<Fryguy-->	ChrisC35: that's an arguable point
[none]	[23:15]	<ChrisC35>	Its also the best no-downtime backup opiton - just put a new drive in
[none]	[23:15]	<end0r57>	Fryguy--: i'm tying to now but i'm not able to select NTFS as an option. just some native *nix file systems and FAT32.

[none]	[23:15]	<ubuntu_Iz>	anyone have a second to answer an xorg driver question?
[none]	[23:15]	<ChrisC35>	with Raid5 is something goes wrong during a file write you can get corrupted files
[none]	[23:15]	<Fryguy-->	end0r57: i dunno, worked for me when I used gparted about a week ago
[none]	[23:15]	<ThunderStruck>	threeseas, should fix you if you can get to tty or a term. in GUI

[none]	[23:16]	<SuperPigs>	?
[none]	[23:16]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: truecrypt
[none]	[23:16]	<flokuehn>	ubuntu_Iz: it must be possible for you to reinstall your needed driver. but i would make an reconfigure of your xorg file instead of editing it manually
[none]	[23:16]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen: the default answer is to use RealPlayer
[none]	[23:16]	<ChrisC35>	besides with these two 500 gigs only cost me $200
[none]	[23:16]	<arooni_>	what is that package to install iefonts (for browsing)?
[none]	[23:16]	<Pirate_Hunter>	the package for compiling stuff in ubuntu is it called build-essentials?
[none]	[23:16]	<Innomen>	murkyMurk: is there one for ubuntu?
[none]	[23:16]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy got it. any other apps?

[none]	[23:16]	<ThunderStruck>	ah - the s but yes
[none]	[23:16]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: RAID is for 1) Uptime 2) up-to-the-last-write backup solution for hardware failure, but is not a real backup solution.
[none]	[23:16]	<ubuntu_Iz>	how would i do that? apt-get install -phigh xorg?

[positive]	[23:17]	<jdong>	lauchazombie / vocx: if you guys are interested, I fixed Azureus ;-)
[none]	[23:17]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy you know?

[none]	[23:17]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: it's the best possible encryption you can do right now

[none]	[23:17]	<PriceChild>	!cfblacklist | Fastn
[negative]	[23:17]	<ubotu>	Fastn: The following cards are blacklisted in Compiz due to stability & compatibility issues: Intel 965. ATI: Rs480, Rv350. ATI Mobility: x300, x600, x700. More info: http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/Hardware/Blacklist/
[none]	[23:17]	<luciano_uisk>	is there a way to change the default screensaver ofgnome?
[none]	[23:17]	<vocx>	jdong, how? This is very interesting...
[positive]	[23:17]	<Innomen>	murkyMurk: easy for someone who knows what you mean by that :)
[none]	[23:17]	<lauchazombie>	jdong, master i will worship you forever
[none]	[23:17]	<Fryguy-->	arooni_: no
[none]	[23:17]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy so if someone wanted to break it. how long would it take?
[none]	[23:17]	<Creed>	The_Joe_, advertising every 30 seconds isnt really space...
[none]	[23:17]	<ChrisC35>	it also wont protect against theft
[none]	[23:18]	<d4rkmonkey>	Fastn I'm pretty sure it has to do with video issues
[none]	[23:18]	<riotkittie>	Fastn: because it was causing problems for enough people with that chipset
[positive]	[23:18]	<The_Joe_>	Creed: I'm anxious....
[none]	[23:18]	<ChrisC35>	but I have had HD's fail so many times
[none]	[23:18]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: depends on your specific implementation and stuff.  10s of years probably?
[none]	[23:18]	<jdong>	vocx / lauchazombie : see comments 117 and below by me, and attached gutsy .deb, on bug 57875
[none]	[23:18]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen:trust me, in 5 minutes you will have realplayer under linux
[none]	[23:18]	<end0r57>	Fryguy--: gparted also crashes every time i try to make a change or refresh everything.
[none]	[23:18]	<Fryguy-->	go read the site and learn some of the basics of encryption
[none]	[23:18]	<luciano_uisk>	i wish to use xscreensaver, but its default is the gnome one, ..
[none]	[23:18]	<ChrisC35>	so I am saying screwit, jsut put it in raid
[none]	[23:18]	<Creed>	The_Joe_, tried searching to forums for an answer?
[none]	[23:18]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy because i am using tor as onion proxy and freenet. but i want to encrypt it all now
[none]	[23:18]	<vocx>	PriceChild, we need better aliases for ubuntu factoids...
[none]	[23:18]	<riotkittie>	Fastn: you can override the blacklist.  SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz
[none]	[23:18]	<d4rkmonkey>	Fastn I use that chipset, and I have just commented out the lines that blacklist it, but I have to turn it off to watch any videos in totem, or to use myth TV
[none]	[23:18]	<jdong>	vocx / lauchazombie : there you will find the cause of the bug, how I fixed it, my pleas to get it into Gutsy, and basically how I spent my past 4 hours
[none]	[23:18]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: well that's different, that's encrypting streams, not files
[none]	[23:18]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: It is not a backup solution, period. You're not doing a backup, you're doing RAID. They're different. If corrupt data is written, then that goes into all your drives. A real backup solution can recover from that -- RAID cannot.
[none]	[23:18]	<Fryguy-->	just use ssh tunnelling for that
[none]	[23:18]	<Innomen>	murkyMurk: i believe you
[negative]	[23:18]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen: go here http://www.real.com/linux/ and download the file
[none]	[23:18]	<riotkittie>	Fastn: or add SKIP_CHECKS=yes to ~/.config/compiz/compiz-manager
[none]	[23:18]	<d4rkmonkey>	riotkittie I would think that just commenting out the lines that blacklist it might be better than stopping it from checking, but I'm not sure
[none]	[23:18]	<lauchazombie>	jdong, again im worshiping you
[none]	[23:19]	<flokuehn>	ubuntu_Iz: just install your needed driver and then du an sudo dpkg --reconfigure xserver-xorg
[none]	[23:19]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy ok i have a ssh tunnel
[none]	[23:19]	<Innomen>	murkyMurk: i may have to, thank you
[none]	[23:19]	<IdleOne>	vocx: if you have any suggestions about factoids you can make them in #ubuntu-ops
[none]	[23:19]	<flokuehn>	ubuntu_Iz: this should work
[none]	[23:19]	<ubuntu_Iz>	how would i make an reconfigure of your xorg file?
[positive]	[23:19]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy but i want to encrypt files, streams and everything so :))
[none]	[23:19]	<jdong>	lauchazombie: always glad to help
[positive]	[23:19]	<Fastn>	thx for all answers, helped me alot :)
[none]	[23:19]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: Hence, RAID should be paired with occasional backups.
[none]	[23:19]	<ubuntu_Iz>	thanks guy
[none]	[23:19]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen: when the file is downloaded, tel me where you have put it
[none]	[23:19]	<ubuntu_Iz>	i appriciate it
[none]	[23:19]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: truecrypt is the best choice for encrypting files
[none]	[23:19]	<jdong>	and now, I am starving, going to get food. please test the packages if you're interested and report back
[none]	[23:19]	<Altk>	i think i'm having trouble with my video card drivers, when i startup X, all i get is a black desktop and a X as my cursor. I have an ATI X300 card in my laptop. Any ideas?
[none]	[23:19]	<Pici>	vocx: or just suggest the factoids yourself, see !usage
[none]	[23:19]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy i also use extended 3 file format so no deleted files can be recovered
[none]	[23:19]	<d4rkmonkey>	Fastn if you don't want to skip checks, edit /usr/bin/compiz and just comment out the lines that have to do with the chipset
[none]	[23:19]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy ok thanks
[negative]	[23:19]	<ThunderStruck>	jdong, welcome to ummmm fun :(
[none]	[23:19]	<ChrisC35>	i agree but for me first comes raid, then i'll setup backups
[none]	[23:19]	<vocx>	IdleOne, Pici  I was just wondering that some factoids have hard to remember names, so an easy alias would be fine
[none]	[23:19]	<ChrisC35>	but i dont want backup without raid
[none]	[23:19]	<IdleOne>	ubuntu_Iz: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[none]	[23:20]	<flokuehn>	ubuntu_Iz: please habe an look in google for the questions will be asked while doing the reconfiguration
[none]	[23:20]	<jodi2>	i have an ubuntu server running can i install gnome or kde but only use it on demand ie the server boots to a promt and not into gnome or kde?
[none]	[23:20]	<Fastn>	d4rkmonkey, thx i try that, can it cause any problems
[none]	[23:20]	<ChrisC35>	anyways, should I be setting up different partitions here? I'm in a first time ubuntu install
[none]	[23:20]	<Fryguy-->	raid as part of an operating system install just unecessarily complicates things
[none]	[23:20]	<ChrisC35>	or just 1 partition for the whole drive?
[none]	[23:20]	<GenNMX>	Yes, everyone should RAID 1 at least, not everyone really needs occasional backups
[none]	[23:20]	<Pici>	vocx: suggest them then. !easy is <alias> hardtorememberfactoid
[none]	[23:20]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy i got a ssh tunnel from a guy. but how strong is it? can he monitor everything i do?
[none]	[23:20]	<IdleOne>	vocx: like I said make your recommendations in #ubuntu-ops . if they feel it is warranted they will make the changes
[none]	[23:20]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen: you got that file yet?
[none]	[23:20]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: Software raid or hardware?
[none]	[23:20]	<Pici>	vocx: in a private message with ubotu preferably.
[none]	[23:20]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: yes
[none]	[23:20]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: this is the wrong channel for this discussion
[none]	[23:20]	<Innomen>	ok first of all if/when this works MasterShrek what do i open the rm with? totem or mplayer?
[none]	[23:21]	<ChrisC35>	software
[none]	[23:21]	<Fryguy-->	Innomen: mplayer
[none]	[23:21]	<Innomen>	murkyMurk: no, not yet i'm trying to open it with build in players before i download a second player
[none]	[23:21]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy so he can monitor waht i do with the ssh tunnel?
[none]	[23:21]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen: you will use realplay
[none]	[23:21]	<jodi2>	i have an ubuntu server running can i install gnome or kde but only use it on demand ie the server boots to a promt and not into gnome or kde?
[none]	[23:21]	<Innomen>	Fryguy--: thank you
[none]	[23:21]	<d4rkmonkey>	Fastn uh, not really. Totem crashes when I try to watch movies, and I have to turn it off to run MythTV, but thats why its blacklisted. I personally think that its better to just comment out the blacklist lines, instead of making it Skip Checks, because then you only stop the blacklist, not any other checks it might have to do
[none]	[23:21]	<Fryguy-->	SuperPigs: like i JUST said, yes, and like I also just said, this is the wrong channel for this discussion
[none]	[23:21]	<SuperPigs>	fryguy frguy sheesh calm down
[none]	[23:21]	<Innomen>	do i need ot reboot to make this work? does ubuntu work that way?
[none]	[23:22]	<vocx>	jdong, just for the record, I tried azureus in Edgy didn't quite work so I've been using occasionally the tarball... It wasn't a big deal really.
[none]	[23:22]	<Fryguy-->	Innomen: you won't need to reboot
[none]	[23:22]	<murkyMurk>	Innomen: forget that, with out the proprietry realplay codecs many realplayer files simply won't open.
[none]	[23:22]	<Fastn>	d4rkmonkey, okey, well do you uncomment it everytime you check mythtv or is it an easyier way to to it?
[none]	[23:22]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: I suggest making /boot, /home, /tmp, /usr, and /var partitions all separate.
[none]	[23:22]	<Fryguy-->	vocx: why not try another application for torrenting? like transmission, deluge, rtorrent, or utorrent via wine?
[none]	[23:22]	<MasterShrek>	Innomen, i would use mplayer
[none]	[23:22]	<MasterShrek>	no u shouldnt have to reboot
[none]	[23:22]	<SlimG>	Is it safe to delete /var/lib/dpkg/updates/* when dpkg isn't running?
[none]	[23:22]	<d4rkmonkey>	Fastn no, you just right click, choose appearance, choose visual effects, then turn it to off when I want to use mythTV/totem
[none]	[23:22]	<Innomen>	MasterShrek: is he right? is rm not gunna play?

[positive]	[23:23]	<Fastn>	d4rkmonkey, Okey thx alot :) how do i comment it out trough terminal?
[none]	[23:23]	<jdong>	vocx: my stand is, either we fix the package (which I had done) or remove it altogether and tell users to go get the tarball rather than fooling them with a broken package
[none]	[23:23]	<MasterShrek>	Innomen, not with w32codecs, theres something else you need...one sec lemme find it

[none]	[23:23]	<ChrisC35>	GenNMX althouhg my new MB does come with a raid onboard controller,  ATI SB600 SATA RAID, and comes with a util, WebPAM that i think you install after and setup the raid - should I be using that?
[none]	[23:23]	<riotkittie>	if you value your data, it's common sense to back it up before making serious changes to a system.
[none]	[23:24]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: Your onboard RAID controller is probably hybrid
[none]	[23:24]	<d4rkmonkey>	Fastn I guess you could use nano or vim to edit the file, I just used gedit then searched for intel, and there was a section with all the blacklist then I put # beside each line I was commenting out

[none]	[23:38]	<Pir8>	DShepherd,  sure
[none]	[23:38]	<DShepherd>	Pir8, Add to Panel .. there's a custom application launcher button. That should help you out. I think you can just drag and drop stuff on the bar too. Whatever makes you happy

[none]	[23:49]	<vik>	Where can I find logs to diagnose where my wireless connection is failing?
[none]	[23:49]	<eyeR>	GenNMX: Yeah. I should know better. Sorry. ... I got the installation done (using dmraid and the standard install process). Then I do a manual installation of grub, restart, then the it makes it to the ubuntu loading bar, but is stuck at the very beginning of the progress bar.
[none]	[23:49]	<gunnar>	I have all the correct software installed.   (build essentials. )  I was able to compile gcc 4.2.2 -- Does any one have it as a deb?

[none]	[23:49]	<bruenig>	apt-get autoremove qt will get you close
[none]	[23:49]	<ChrisC35>	GenNMX although maybe I should create a swp partition of about a gig on each HD?
[none]	[23:49]	<arooni_>	i have an intel core 2 duo.  is there any need to use the 64 bit version of ubuntu ( i was hoping for faster speeds ;p ) ?

[none]	[23:51]	<vik>	Where can I find logs to diagnose where my wireless connection is failing?
[none]	[23:51]	<ChrisC35>	GenNMX I'm still confused though If I should be using the regular installer, or the 'altnerate' one
[none]	[23:51]	<honeking>	does anyone know how to fix a sound problem?
[none]	[23:51]	<stefg>	flick, sudo apt-get autoremove kdelibs-core should take all other kde stuff witg it as dependency

[none]	[23:51]	<casey_>	How do I remove the old kernels from my GRUB boot menu?
[none]	[23:51]	<Fryguy-->	honeking: ask the question you really want to ask
[none]	[23:51]	<LifeNomad>	Fryguy--: I tried to, but it was not working correctly.  And I could not find the compizconfig-manager app in the repo
[none]	[23:51]	<stinger05>	hi, im in the live cd now, but it's still on the detecting filesystems part while installing,,,it's stuck on it meaning it's not progressing, what can i do ?

[none]	[23:52]	<vocx>	"jdong interesting. Although I don't think many people realize the difference between compiling and running with the GCJ or JVM, and Ubuntu package.

[none]	[23:52]	<tony>	Anyone: I upgraded to 7.10 and now my laptop won't boot
[none]	[23:52]	<GenNMX>	eyeR: In the Grub menu, edit your boot line and remove -splash. Then you can see where it stops at. How long did you wait at the progress bar?

[none]	[23:52]	<GenNMX>	ChrisC35: Just use the regular one.
[positive]	[23:52]	<Fryguy-->	LifeNomad: so then address the issue of what's causing you to be unable to find the compizconfig-settings-manager and work from there.  Make sure you have 3d acceleration enabled, etc
[none]	[23:52]	<jdong>	vocx: Debian is working on uploading Azureus 3 in their existing packaging format
[none]	[23:52]	<cpt>	kitche, you mean that i can get a cube effect on the windows i have on 1 desktop to be in the cube ?
[none]	[23:52]	<bobgill>	how can I get it back ??

[none]	[23:55]	<ChrisC35>	GenNMX alright thanks - i will try the regular. When you say the swp partiton should be part of the raid1 - do I actually make each HD 2 partitions, 499gig and 1gig for swp - and setup raid which is for the whole drive - or do I just partition the whole drive as 1 partition , and then setup raid, and the swp is handled automatically
[none]	[23:55]	<jdong>	vocx: I would've built with sun-java5 or sun-java6, btu both are in multiverse and unusable on the Ubuntu builders, because they pop up the license agreement and nobdoy's there to agree to it!

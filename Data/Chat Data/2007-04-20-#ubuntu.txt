[12:01] <CodingZen> Anyone help me with a login font size problem? its way too huge!
[12:01] <swedekid> !firestarter
[12:01] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[12:01] <mc44> ffm: the network is busy...
[12:01] <nxspnt> xtknight, all I know is that if I use the ATA133 style IDE hard drive, then I can get linux to install, if I use SATA then it is hit or miss on the distro installer seeing the SATA controller.  Some see it and get kernel panics and others never see the controller
[12:01] <LjL> swedekid: please learn about the Ubuntu repositories and components (Universe is a component). software in Ubuntu gets installed from the Ubuntu repositories, which contain packages.
[12:01] <penguin42> CodingZen: Have you tried System->Administration-> Login Window ?
[12:01] <Dybber> Is this: http://dybber.dk/Sk%A6rmbillede.png (Default Mixer Tracks) where i should change which soundcard that should be used? If so, then this doesnt work in my installation of Feisty.
[12:01] <jman_> xtknight, the one I was using in edgy was ensoniq PCI
[12:01] <cedricshock> ffm: That's probably the servers being swamped.

[12:02] <jman_> it worked fine til i upgraded
[12:02] <ffm> mc44: cedricshock: But this issue was occuring 5 days ago as well.
[12:02] <iGadget> slyfox: I use that method to share photos and media files with my gf... there's a small catch, though - newly created / copied files won't get the proper permissions by default. You have to fix that manually every time. There should be a solution to that, but I havn't had the time to look for it yet.
[12:02] <CodingZen> penguin42: where would i go to change the font size.. in there?
[12:02] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, still a negative..... with or without the analog/digital switch checked
[12:02] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, the speaker test is still showing me "Fron Left"

[12:09] <cnez0red> I downloaded the alternate iso, mounted it, and ran the update script from there. Was  I stupid?

[12:10] <swedekid> LgL: i just installed firestarter, but i cant find it anywhere
[12:10] <LjL> swedekid: man, if you don't read on how things work, you can only stay confused. Ubuntu uses the APT package management system, which can automatically install packages (i.e. programs and libraries) from repositories (which are Internet sites provided by Ubuntu). the official repositories have four components: Main, Restricted, Universe, and Multiverse. the package you are looking for (firestarter) is in Universe, which is not enabled by default. go to
[12:10] <LjL> Software Sources, and enable it.
[12:10] <mc44> alleyoopster: ok, probably easier to update yes
[12:10] <Cpudan80> penguin42: how can I capture the return value then? :/
[12:10] <rafaelba> ok
[12:10] <LjL> swedekid: and read the site the bot gave you so i won't have to exercise my typing skills so much again :)

[12:14] <beoba> hi, ive noticed that ubuntu server tends to keep loading daemons/init scripts even after the login prompt (in a direct linux console, it'll have the prompt, then continue spamming startup messages after the prompt), how do i go about setting things up such that the login prompt is only brought up AFTER everything else has finished loading? this isn't especially crucial, just "one of those things"

[12:29] <niriven> xtknight: reisers cmpany is taking over development to finish 4, but they didnt say naything about further development i dont think
[12:29] <xtknight> IncredibleHink, type "dmesg" it's at the end
[12:29] <[ithaycu] > my sound card isn't working in fesity :-(
[12:29] <xtknight> niriven, they are still working on it slowly
[12:29] <holycow> T0uCH, actually no, its just you.   this is open source, basically its super powerfull but at the same time we give you a REALLY REALLY big gun to shoot yoru self with
[12:29] <xtknight> niriven, only 2 major bugs left
[12:29] <penguin42> [ithaycu] : type   asoundconf list      and tell us if it lists a card and if so what
[12:29] <niriven> xtknight: ah
[12:29] <xtknight> niriven, NFS and something else... actually they dont affect most people
[12:29] <IncredibleHink> xtkn
[12:29] <justin420> Subhuman: didnt work, logging into a failsafe gnome session; x still encounters an error. could you tell me where the sessions startup file is located so i can edit which programs start automatically?
[12:29] <holycow> T0uCH, be prepared to take responsobility for your own actions here, there is very little sympathy for not taking the time to learn the tools you are using
[12:29] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, allright wtf
[12:30] <[ithaycu] > penguin42: I can you tell that I've worked on the prob some
[12:30] <Eleaf> heh
[12:30] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, i plugged my speakers into a another port on my soundcard
[12:30] <niriven> xtknight: well im more about well rounded filesystems, like ext3, if reiser4 is only good for small files, it doesnt really interest me
[12:30] <mc44> !upgrade | T0uCH
[12:30] <ubotu> T0uCH: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[12:30] <[ithaycu] > penguin42: the card is an ATI SB450 HDA
[12:30] <Subhuman> justin420, in that case - it cant be an application you added  - did u change anything else?
[12:30] <jasin> Trying to update everything to fiesty fawn 7.04. what a pain in the ass this is.
[12:30] <vqregati> viva o ubuntu!
[12:30] <xtknight> IncredibleHink, heh...yeah that could be the problem ;)
[12:30] <mc44> T0uCH: please follow the instructions in this link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[12:30] <T0uCH> i already done all thses
[12:30] <xtknight> IncredibleHink, 2.0 speakers need to be in lineout (GREEN)
[12:30] <EdsipeR> yupi!
[12:30] <TheoMurpse> I'm trying to upgrade Ubuntu. I try to do the offical Update Manager method, but "authentication fail[s]  -- ... There may be a problem with the network or with the server". I have the full CD though. Is there any way to upgrade from the CD?
[12:30] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, no... its not working,...i hear some weird ass bongos at an irregular rate
[12:30] <xtknight> niriven, it isn't, though.  it's great for lots of things
[12:30] <penguin42> [ithaycu] : Ah - not the same problem I've got then (there is a known Intel one on some laptops)
[12:30] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, thast where i had them
[12:30] <busfahrer> Excuse me, apt-get update stalls at 'receiving headers'... any fix for that?
[12:30] <[ithaycu] > penguin42: I have downloaded the most current rc of the alsa drivers
[12:31] <xtknight> niriven, less slowdown after fragmentation.  it has a repacker unlike ext3
[12:31] <holycow> T0uCH, remember if you aren't happy, be sue to ask for a refund
[12:31] <holycow> :)
[12:31] <dIsTuRbEd1> HeLp! "I added a few lines to my sources.list and now i want to fix this list prob, yes i am a newbie but doing okay so(i installed nvidia video drivers fine :) how does one use vim to delete the lines i added?
[12:31] <T0uCH> i am trying to explain i had a power faillure (electricity house) during the installation and it bug all
[12:31] <justin420> Subhuman: actually that is the only thing i changed.  i have one user logged into the shell; doing boinc. and no other gui users logged in. the only startup program i added was beryl-manager
[12:31] <xtknight> niriven, it beats ext3 in almost every aspect according to some nonofficial benchmarks
[12:31] <magnetron> !upgrade | TheoMurpse
[12:31] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, i figured what the hell ill try all the ports.... far left gives me weird bongo noses
[12:31] <niriven> xtknight: Ah. See i ran jfs for awhile, excellent on large files, sucky for small (really, really sucky), and, it made me go back to ext3
[12:31] <ubotu> TheoMurpse: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[12:31] <jasin> My sources.lst is probably screwed up.
[12:31] <GPLGeek> Hey, quite a few of you had asked me for help with the new buntu getting some debian repos with E17 to install in buntu, I doubt that would work but I'd gladly show you CVS instructions, or offer that any source package would work.
[12:31] <breakthru> d
[12:31] <jasin> If apt-get is not working for you then your sources.lst probably messed up
[12:31] <Flannel> thehumanerror: Google Talk is jabber/XMPP, with the voice stuff done with "Jingle", Kopote and Telepathy implement Jingle
[12:31] <xtknight> IncredibleHink, bongo noises? lol
[12:31] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, oh shit!!! i bet that sound test is still running.... how do i terminate it if i cant see it....  i just ctrl-c'd out of it
[12:31] <penguin42> xtknight: You mention there is a major NFS issue - what is it?  Client seems to work fine form the minor fiddling
[12:31] <tonyyarusso> GPLGeek: there's a script for doing E17 somewhere too
[12:32] <T0uCH> if nobody can help me with just gave me a link for the live cd .. and i will format all!
[12:32] <TheoMurpse> magnetron: I used that page. The suggested method fails.
[12:32] <xtknight> IncredibleHink, killall speaker-test
[12:32] <GPLGeek> I'm unsure if there are any multiverse packages or universe packages but I'd check there first though

[12:32] <fluid> greets

[12:33] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, how would i do that

[12:34] <sooooop> holycow can we downgrade the kernel?
[12:34] <jasin> So many people are downloading 7.04 that the servers are being killed. its basically the same as if they were hit with a ddos attack.
[12:34] <TheoMurpse> magnetron: the "great" was targeted at canonical. the "thanks" was truly typed, and targeted at you, didn't mean to seem rude
[12:35] <wuzzerd> u can use old kernel if u still have it
[12:35] <brunoUT> this is so darn annoying.....when will these stupid servers start working and allow me to upgrade????
[12:35] <holycow> sooooop, you can recompile your own sure
[12:35] <leroi_> hey guys i just installed a fresh copy of 7.04 and there was an icon in the top right of computer hardware and it was telling i needed to install unsupported ATI drivers so i did and the download would not work so i cancelled it and it wont come back
[12:35] <kondor101> oh yea its 7.04 day,  should i switch from 7.04 pre release?
[12:35] <jasin> download the iso, it has everything.
[12:35] <magnetron> TheoMurpse: you are welcome

[12:35] <brunoUT> how do i fix this crap??
[12:35] <jasin> You can get the iso without any trouble.
[12:35] <bakefy> When i click on the new distribution  7.04 it just freezes
[12:35] <justin420> brunoUT: when everybody else stop slamming the servers for the new ubuntu
[12:35] <holycow> sooooop, i don't think you can use the old kernel without recompile because th elibc6 and many other components are different
[12:35] <justin420> :)
[12:35] <magnetron> !final |  kondor101
[12:35] <ubotu> kondor101: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn), and haven't neglected to accept the automatic updates, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[12:35] <DanaG> Is there anywhere to get a deb of Thunderbird 2?
[12:35] <DjViper> kondor101: backup /home first ;)
[12:35] <ryan_> does anyone have a link to torrents that are on another tracker?
[12:35] <brunoUT> how has anyone updated then?
[12:35] <jasin> brunoUT, download the iso, you can get that without any troubles.
[12:36] <declan> The problem I have with official releases is that by the time it is released, I've normally been using the thing for 6 weeks already.... I'm nearly ready for a new one at that stage.
[12:36] <mc44> leroi_: system -> administration -> restricted driver manager
[12:36] <holycow> DanaG, not yet, but just download their .tar.gz and extract and double click on their binary
[12:36] <LjL> brunoUT: switch mirrors to some that work.
[12:36] <brunoUT> i have the ISO
[12:36] <justin420> brunoUT: patiently
[12:36] <fluid> might as well ask since i came in...lol. ive got a laptop with edgy on it, and i got everything working as far as ati+xgl+beryl/compiz ... but the thing seems to freeze everytime i go to log out in gnome. have not bothered with kde, and dont plan to ;) anyone ever find a solution to that?
[12:36] <LjL> brunoUT: or *wait*
[12:36] <brunoUT> but it will not let me update
[12:36] <holycow> DanaG, it runs just like that no need to install until you get a deb packaged for you
[12:36] <brunoUT> how on earth do i update?
[12:36] <LjL> brunoUT: it won't indeed
[12:36] <fluid> im sure i get the usual "the ati drivers are horrible" response. hehe
[12:36] <brunoUT> i booted from my cd
[12:36] <brunoUT> and there is no update option
[12:36] <brunoUT> !
[12:36] <kondor101> DjViper,  that sounds to me like i am probably already using final
[12:36] <mc44> fluid: they are
[12:36] <LjL> brunoUT: can't you wait a day? the servers are *overloaded*. no, there is no update option on the CD.
[12:36] <leroi_> i downloaded and installed the fglrx  driver from synaptic but when i do fglrxinfo it still says mesa drivers

[12:38] <IncredibleHink> xtknight, I have one more question though
[12:38] <wastrel> Enron:  hit esc when you start booting to enter the grub menu you can choose the rescue image then
[12:38] <leroi_> brunoUT just wait til tomorrow
[12:38] <[ithaycu] > Enron: once you do that, choose the rescue boot
[12:38] <brunoUT> ok new question that maybe someone can answer.....why are they GRAYED out updates in my update manager???

[12:39] <ubotu> LjL: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[12:39] <Pelo> brunoUT,  they exist but are currently unavailable
[12:39] <mc44> mirak: ... why??
[12:39] <jasin> Flannel, posting the ubuntu website in #ubuntu is spamming? ROFL

[12:39] <brunoUT> i shall wait to get these updates

[12:40] <brunoUT> something about their server sucks
[12:40] <LjL> iGadget: type "apt-torrent" on google
[12:40] <Pelo> brunoUT,   they'll become available eventualy or be withdrawn,  don'T worry abut it  go on with your life
[12:40] <Crazytom> RedNeckBoy, i don't know about that, but my wireless started working when i installed feisty
[12:40] <nexact> brunoUT: yeah I guess...
[12:40] <LjL> !slow
[12:40] <mitch> if i'm on beta, do i need to do anything with the 7.04 release?
[12:40] <lieter> hi, how do i set vlc as my default movie player?
[12:40] <ubotu> The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[12:40] <xtknight> LjL, do you know off hand if apt-torrent can solve the problem we're having now?
[12:40] <brunoUT> haha good luck tho man

[12:40] <leroi_> do the ati driver instructions for 6.10 work for 7.04
[12:40] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, would it be better If I'd clean install?
[12:41] <LjL> xtknight: (and igadget) however, there *is* a spec to add torrent support to Ubuntu's APT
[12:41] <dIsTuRbEd1> how does one edit and save the sources.list????????
[12:41] <xtknight> LjL, yeah i saw it the other day.  hope it goes thru
[12:41] <clop> are there known issues with amd64 ubuntu feisty not being able to correctly access hard drives?
[12:41] <hagabaka> in the grub menu, i get a list of kernel versions. does this mean Ubuntu keeps several kernels? what about the modules?
[12:41] <Hairulfr> peter77: Then if you gotten the updates that came this last week or two you are up to date. Otherwise do: sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade,
[12:41] <mc44> dIsTuRbEd1: why do you want to do that?
[12:41] <xtknight> dIsTuRbEd1, gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources.list  and click SAve
[12:41] <breakthru> penguin42: the menu shows only "minimize maximize ontop move resize close", i'm using Xgl
[12:41] <dIsTuRbEd1> THANK YOU
[12:41] <fluid> oh i know what i want..and just dont know the name of one. what do you guys prefer for backing up and entire system to DVDR or CDR?
[12:41] <Flannel> hagabaka: a few kernels because of the few kernel versions.
[12:41] <zer> how can it be that usbhid is loaded although i removed the .ko-file??
[12:41] <LjL> dIsTuRbEd1:  gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list . but if you're trying to upgrade from Edgy to Feisty, don't do it like that.
[12:41] <mc44> !upgrade | dIsTuRbEd1
[12:41] <ubotu> dIsTuRbEd1: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[12:41] <Pelo> dIsTuRbEd1,  gksu gedit /etc/sources.list
[12:41] <Flannel> !backup | fluid
[12:41] <ubotu> fluid: There are many ways to back your system up. Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !sbackup and !cloning
[12:41] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: No, I don't think so. Did you ever try the radeon-drivers?
[12:41] <dIsTuRbEd1> to fix something i did to it
[12:41] <billy> fluid, DVDr.
[12:41] <Pelo> oops
[12:41] <dwhsix> should I ask 6.06->6.10 upgrade problems here?  Or is this error just because the servers are all getting whacked?  "Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2 Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)"
[12:42] <hagabaka> Flannel: for each kernel it keeps, the kernel modules are also kept right?
[12:42] <fluid> read all that...except the duplicity one...ty flannel
[12:42] <mistone> sorry for retarded question but if I installed the feisty beta I am now using fiesty after I upgraded
[12:42] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, yeah and they don't work for my ATI Radeon 250M
[12:42] <Hairulfr> hagabaka: There should be the newly installed kernel and the latest working and then two recovery kernels, also new/latest working.
[12:42] <penguin42> breakthru: For me I see other options below the minimize/maximize/blah/close options - I've got Desktop-effects enabled on feisty
[12:42] <billy> mistone, yes.
[12:42] <Pelo> dwhsix,  every one wants it , be patient
[12:42] <mistone> cool
[12:42] <crackintosh> so has anyone had any problems doing the "upgrade"
[12:42] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: At least during installation you should use radeon in your xorg.conf and do a uninstall of fglrx.
[12:42] <hagabaka> hmm
[12:42] <Chm0d>  has anyone heard of a problem of a screen just goign black on you? like for example just now I was playign quake2 and it goes black but the game is still running
[12:42] <magnetron> !final | mistone
[12:42] <ubotu> mistone: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn), and haven't neglected to accept the automatic updates, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[12:42] <hagabaka> i have 5 versions
[12:42] <brunoUT> ballsacks they need new servers
[12:42] <Pelo> crackintosh,  wait a few days  the servers are swamped
[12:42] <dwhsix> Pelo: yeah but I'm only trying to get from 6.06 to 6.10... (but of course so I can upgrade to 7 :-) )
[12:43] <Dasnipa`> dwhsix, 7.04
[12:43] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: It should be easier to do a clean reinstall of the fglrx-drivers after that, if you're not happy with xorg-radeon.
[12:43] <Pelo> dwhsix,  same servers
[12:43] <crackintosh> Pelo: It can be downloaded from different repositories correct?
[12:43] <hagabaka> oh, actually 3, 2.6.20-15, 2.6.17-11, 2.6.17-10
[12:43] <dIsTuRbEd1> no i'm not tring to upgrade
[12:43] <dwhsix> Dasnipa: okay, 7.04.  sorry
[12:43] <RedNeckBoy>  <Angeluz> can I tell you a secret?, I'm never buyin' ATI again :P
[12:43] <fluid> ive just been using a script to tar/bzip everything on the machine except for the dynamic directories...seems crude to me for some reason. lol
[12:43] <dIsTuRbEd1> just repair it
[12:43] <Pelo> crackintosh,  if you're in a hurry,   get the torrent and make a clean install
[12:43] <dwhsix> Pelo: yup, I figgered... okay, I'll go do something else for a few days and then come back
[12:43] <Stoffer> is it possible that the gnome network manager is reporting a 50% wireless signal strength while the actual strength is much higher?  Is there a way i could check it?  wmwave also says 50%...
[12:43] <hagabaka> are you having problems with fglrx on feisty too?
[12:43] <iGadget> LjL: if there's already a spec, there's no use for me to go posting a blueprint about it in launchpad I suppose?
[12:43] <dwhsix> thanks
[12:44] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: Same goes for me, unless they release an improved driver, like they announced.
[12:44] <Hairulfr> !final | crackintosh

[12:44] <alex22> i have a AMD processor
[12:44] <alex22> which version do i download
[12:44] <askar> Stoffer: and only 50
[12:44] <TheoMurpse> pelo that's what i'd be doing if the new livecd didn't freeze on me (despite the fact that I ran the "verify CD contents" command after booting the live CD and verified that it was burned properly
[12:44] <neuratix> I've got a problem during upgrade: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16454/
[12:44] <eternaljoy> does Ubuntu 7.04 come as a LiveCD?
[12:44] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: Haha... they did the same before?
[12:44] <Hairulfr> eternaljoy: Yes
[12:44] <magnetron> Stoffer: i have the same issue. i think it is because my gard is 108Mbps while the AP is 54 Mbps
[12:44] <TheoMurpse> eternaljoy yes it does, and it's online

[12:45] <eternaljoy> is Ubuntu 7.04 the one known as Edgy? sorry, had a brain blank :P
[12:45] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, a while ago i think... I sent emails... that's what they had answered
[12:45] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: I don't know anything about that, but they said they were working on a completely rewritten OpenGL-driver.
[12:45] <dIsTuRbEd1> wow this place is f-ing crazyly loaded with ppl
[12:45] <Stoffer> magnetron, well mine are both 54... is there a way I can test the real speed
[12:45] <z987k> eternaljoy, no it's fiesty
[12:45] <eternaljoy> i thought Ubun tu 6.10 was knopwn as Edgy
[12:45] <DanaG> My nautilus just times out on the ssh server.
[12:45] <ytsestef> any1 know why sometimes I have sound and some other I dont? where's the alsaconf command?? :(
[12:45] <nir_ai> what is the default root password?
[12:45] <Hairulfr> eternaljoy: No, 7.04 is Feisty Fawn, Edgy is the older
[12:45] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: Hmm... you should have contacted Michael of Phoronix when you received those news. :)
[12:45] <z987k> eternaljoy, yes 6.10 = edgy
[12:45] <askar> Stoffer: Got mucher signal in windows before too.. tought that it was my card that was getting bad.. but apparently not then :S Im having a d-link DWL-G650+

[12:46] <mwe> hagabaka: sudo /etc/init.d/kdm start

[12:46] <LjL> iGadget: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/apt-torrent
[12:46] <eternaljoy> how come they dont offer 6.10 as LiveCD?  They only have 6.06 and 7.04 as a liveCD option to download!  why isnt 6.10 there?
[12:46] <hagabaka> oh

[12:46] <Angeluz> DeX-aNoM-MwG-: Yes, but you'll need the fglrx-drivers from ati. And they suck.
[12:46] <askar> Stoffer:  dont really know what driver im using? It worked out of the box..

[12:47] <DeX-aNoM-MwG-> thanks angel/wastrel, ill check ito ut just wanted to make sure there was hope :)
[12:47] <Stoffer> askar, yea, I was surprised when fiesty did that
[12:47] <dwhsix> ytsestef: sounds like maybe you've got a different problem

[12:47] <Stoffer> magnet, have you tried using ndiswrapper instead of your current driver?
[12:47] <askar> Stoffer: We could file a bugreport but it propably get very low in the priority list :)
[12:48] <ytsestef> z987k, the command does not exist

[12:48] <z987k> ytsestef, ok, I thought that was what I used way back when I actaully had to config alsa
[12:48] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, well I hope they're gonna work fast 'cause i know a LOT of ppl who promised to buy Nvidia next time

[12:49] <Stoffer> magnetron, is the ath_pci driver the same as madwifi?
[12:49] <crackintosh> RedNeckBoy: what video card vendor are you suggesting?
[12:49] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: Same here, even though I told everyone to wait at least until august for ATI/AMD to release their new driver.

[12:50] <eternaljoy> why did http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download stop offering Ubuntu 6.10 as a download?  They onlu have 6.06 and 7.04. Anyone know?
[12:50] <_Neil> nir_ai: startx
[12:50] <ytsestef> z987k I used to use alsaconfig and be able to configure alsa, but now there's not such a command. And it's not like I have any special soundcard its good' ol' ac97...
[12:50] <Stoffer> magnetron, you don't suppose the signal strength might go higher if I stop using roaming mode do you?
[12:50] <milage> I can't find the proper package in synaptic ;o
[12:50] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz oh yeah they had some kind of Fusion... that is probably going to be something hardcore nice
[12:50] <penguin42> eternaljoy: 6.06 is on long term support
[12:50] <milage> that it, what I've been told is the proper package
[12:50] <z987k> ytsestef, is alsaconfig installed?  apt-get install alsaconfig

[12:52] <bimberi> z987k: occasionally.  usually a 'sudo apt-get update' fixes it
[12:52] <ytsestef> z987k I also checked the ubuntu repositories, there's no such package, not anyone that includes alsaconfig either
[12:52] <milage> Is there a way to get around that problem? :p

[12:52] <mwe> milage: blame macrobe
[12:52] <tehquickness> Does anyone have any sugestions?
[12:52] <eternaljoy> can ubuntu 7.04 run without a swap file?
[12:52] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, no but they can't leave us without support either... they will probably do at least good proprietary stuff... they have to... i mean we're a lot of ppl using linux now and GROWING
[12:52] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: But you really should take a look at Phoronix. There will be a huge article about the delevopment of Linux-drivers in cooperation with ATI/AMD.
[12:52] <milage> Blaming won't help me much :p
[12:52] <dIsTuRbEd1> YOU GUYS ROCK THANKS FOR THE HELP!!!
[12:52] <LjL> eternaljoy: yes, but i wouldn't call it a good idea
[12:52] <penguin42> eternaljoy: You normally have a separate partition for swap, it's not essential but it is normal
[12:52] <_Neil> askar: Does it play stuff in firefox?
[12:52] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: I agree.
[12:52] <magnetron> Stoffer: 100% of what? those figures doesn't really measure the speed, it is only comparable in the same software
[12:52] <_Neil> thats what i really need
[12:52] <mwe> milage: supposedly they're working on a 64bit linux release
[12:52] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: But the BSD-guys are still fracked.
[12:53] <ytsestef> z987k, ok I just thought this is weird because in any other distro getting sound is the easiest thing through alsa...
[12:53] <Stoffer> magnet, 100%signal strength
[12:53] <eternaljoy> LjL: why not?
[12:53] <milage> In the mean time, is there a decent reverse engineered flash plugin?
[12:53] <z987k> bimberi, I'll try the update
[12:53] <salty> how do i configure both of my sound cards to stream simultaneously from the same source?
[12:53] <wehttamb> how can i upgrade from ubuntu 7.04 beta to the final release?
[12:53] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, I never read about BSD
[12:53] <magnetron> milage: i heard that gnash is the best, but it is till alpha
[12:53] <eternaljoy> penguin42: what would happen if I dont create a swap partition? fesity will still load and run as normal?
[12:53] <bimberi> wehttamb: just run update-manager
[12:53] <penguin42> Sheesh - there are people here having problems with one sound card - and you want to use two at once :-)
[12:53] <Sombrero> hello all
[12:53] <NickGarvey> wehttamb: as far as I know, its just "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"
[12:53] <Pelo> wehttamb,  you donT' have to just leave the updates on and it will happen
[12:54] <z987k> eternaljoy, yes it will but you might want to make one
[12:54] <eternaljoy> z987k: why?
[12:54] <penguin42> eternaljoy: Yes - I'm not sure if the installer will try and insist on it
[12:54] <wehttamb> k
[12:54] <milage> I can live with that as long as it doesn't crash bigger things than my browser, i suppose
[12:54] <LjL> eternaljoy: because 1) even if you have lots of RAM, it can be demonstrated that swap space still helps  2) hibernation won't work without swap  3) out of memory errors on Linux are BAD
[12:54] <z987k> eternaljoy, in case you use all your RAM
[12:54] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: I don't do that very often either.
[12:54] <mwe> milage: some people run a 32bit chrooted firefox to get flash
[12:54] <flyinghippo> Would anyone happen to know of any advantages to IPv6 in Ubuntu?
[12:54] <mistone> z987k: it will make your perfromance suck alot
[12:54] <_Neil> anyone ? How to play realmedia in firefox?
[12:54] <eternaljoy> LjL: bad in what way?  they can cause hardware failure?
[12:54] <Sombrero> The release notes for 7.04 mention that 256mb ram should be sufficient to install and run Ubuntu.  Can anyone here verify that it would be worthwhile to actually do so with a P2 400mhz machine?
[12:54] <Angeluz> LjL: I can agree on the latter.
[12:54] <_Neil> It tells me i need a plugin, and to install it
[12:54] <z987k> if you dont create swap and max out the ram wont the system crash?
[12:54] <milage> Seems like the one I have is 64bit
[12:55] <LjL> eternaljoy: eh, no, come on now... they can crash the system really bad, though
[12:55] <magnetron> !xubuntu | Sombrero
[12:55] <ubotu> Sombrero: xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of Gnome. For more info, see http://www.xubuntu.org and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/ - To install from Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop". | For support, see #xubuntu | See also: !ubuntu and !xubuntu-channels
[12:55] <milage> that would be whatever was included with 6.10
[12:55] <eternaljoy> LjL: ok got it, cheers
[12:55] <Dante123> i'm getting the following error when upgrading:  http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-commercial/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2: Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)
[12:55] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, do you recommend for I to switch to 64bit apps yet? or is it still unstable?
[12:55] <LjL> z987k: the kernel won't necessarily crash, but bad things will happen anyway
[12:55] <DanaG> xfce slaughters my arrow and home-pgup-pgdn-end keys.
[12:55] <bimberi> Sombrero: I have run Ubuntu on a Celeron 466 with 256MB.  Slow but usable.
[12:55] <DanaG> :(
[12:55] <magnetron> Sombrero: xubuntu is ubuntu for low-end computer
[12:55] <justintime32> is anyone getting upgrade download speeds above  KB/s?
[12:55] <mistone> z987k: it might crash but most likely just go crazy slow
[12:55] <penguin42> Dante123: Is that the only error or are there any before that?
[12:55] <justintime32> 50 KB/s*
[12:55] <DanaG> It turns them into enter and Hiragana and Katakana keys.
[12:55] <LjL> !slow

[12:55] <DanaG> in xev.
[12:55] <eternaljoy> LjL: im just wondering, because the USB stick version I created on my 1Gig USB stick, didnt need a swap partition and it runs fine
[12:55] <bimberi> Sombrero: Xubuntu on the same config was better
[12:55] <dj-fu> !torrents
[12:55] <salty> how do i configure both of my sound cards to stream simultaneously from the same source?
[12:55] <ubotu> Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[12:56] <Dante123> penguin42......two of the same error when trying to upgrade....
[12:56] <justintime32> ubotu? hah
[12:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hah - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[12:56] <_Neil> How do i play realmedia in firefox?
[12:56] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: Its not a questions of stability anymore, but there are certain plugins that need lots of tweaking to run with a 64bit-program...
[12:56] <Sombrero> magnetron, ok, so that would probably be a good idea then.  Are all things more-or-less the same?  Still has wpa support for example?
[12:56] <justintime32> haha
[12:56] <penguin42> Dante123: Any other errors - it's unusual for that to be the only one
[12:56] <IndyGunFreak> i downloaded feisty via torrent at an average of 500k, no probs at all.
[12:56] <LjL> eternaljoy: well, swap on a USB stick is, conversely, a very bad idea. USB sticks are flash memory, and flash memory can only be written to a finite number of time. if you put swap on a flash memory stick, you'll ruin it.
[12:56] <Joshua_Cook> Hello, I have a question regarding RAID 1 and Ubuntu Breezy Badger. I have posted about it on the Ubuntu Forums at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=405944. If any one can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it.
[12:56] <brunoUT> why does my 'fetching files' pause at 40 of the 50??????
[12:56] <ghostisgray> sup all
[12:56] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: If you do video-editing and stuff, or need a *huge* amount of RAM, I'd recommend it.
[12:56] <dreamcastjack> hey, anyone else having problems w/ Amarok?
[12:56] <interfear> 7.04 is out now?
[12:56] <LjL> eternaljoy: however, i think that even the live CD tries to use a swap partition if it can find a suitable one on a HD
[12:56] <Dante123> starts the upgrade.....then I get that error.....in the box it says...something about could be network problem
[12:56] <Dante123> but network is fine
[12:56] <eternaljoy> LjL: in fact, according to the install insturctions, the  USB stick version doesnt create  swap partition at all
[12:57] <soothsay> interfear: You just missed it. Come back in 6 months
[12:57] <Hairulfr> !slow
[12:57] <LjL> brunoUT: because. the. servers. are. slow.
[12:57] <ubotu> The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[12:57] <MacSlow> interfear, yes
[12:57] <RedNeckBoy> Angeluz, I only have 512Mb ram..
[12:57] <magnetron> Sombrero: i haven't actually tried Xubuntu, but wpa support has been around for along time.
[12:57] <MacSlow> interfear, since this afternoon
[12:57] <Skygge> if I run update-manager I just get the normal update thing showing me what I can upgrade
[12:57] <Angeluz> RedNeckBoy: In that case, you'll be fine with i386.
[12:57] <MacSlow> interfear, depending where you sit on the globe
[12:57] <penguin42> eternaljoy: It can work fine as long as you have plenty of pysical ram; still it can still be more efficient to have some swap so that Linux can push infrequently used stuff out to swap and let you use your ram for more common stuff
[12:57] <dreamcastjack> i have all the codecs installed by Amarok wont read them.
[12:57] <DanaG> Don'tcha love the character droppings?
=== stealthy is now known as sylvisj
[12:57] <eternaljoy> LjL: so it seems ubuntu can run fine without a swap
[12:57] <interfear> MacSlow: I sit in new jersey
[12:57] <Sombrero> magnetron, alright, I'll try Xubuntu then. Thanks
[12:57] <eternaljoy> penguin42: yeah
[12:57] <DanaG> /* this thingy: (        , )  : is cool for debugging processes. */
[12:57] <Flannel> Skygge: make sure youre fully updated
[12:58] <variant> eternaljoy: if you have plenty of ram and all you do is browse the net etc then there is no need for swap
[12:58] <sylvisj> Ok - trying to install xubuntu. Had some issues because of my 8800gts, but using the vesa driver fixed that. What am I supposed to login as?
[12:58] <Skygge> meh, latest wine is the ghay. but okay.
[12:58] <Skygge> Flannel, thanks
[12:58] <LjL> eternaljoy: no, it simply means that it *can* run, and that the disadvantages are fewer than that of putting a swap file on a USB key (read: hardware failure)
[12:58] <eternaljoy> variant: i have 1 Gig Ram
[12:58] <Dante123> should I change my repository listing from Main server to USA??
[12:58] <milage> Skygge?
[12:58] <Angeluz> sylvisj: With the login you creating during the install-process. :)
[12:58] <eternaljoy> LjL: ok understood

[12:58] <sylvisj> Angeluz, that's the problem - the installer didn't run because of the X fuckup
[12:58] <ghostisgray> sup i am a complete noob, and am interested in installing ubuntu on my laptop, it already has win-xp on it. All i want to know is if i goto install ubuntu will there be a dual os setup thing i can follow?
[12:58] <DanaG> I mean, put those segments in pieces of debug output.

[12:59] <TUTUx> Dante123, it's not that big deal if you are already in US
[12:59] <sylvisj> LjL, ok.
[12:59] <Skygge> milage, I've been holding off updating latest wine as it screws with Steam, but I guess I'll have to to do an upgrade
[12:59] <Dante123> could this error just be network congestion
[12:59] <bruenig> rhythmbox crashes everytime I try to play something with it
[12:59] <sylvisj> Angelus, How would I run the installer?
[12:59] <DanaG> For example: doing some long-winded process:
[12:59] <DanaG> startend
[12:59] <Dante123> I'm in canada actually
[12:59] <magnetron> ghostisgray: hi! yes it is.
[12:59] <variant> eternaljoy: then any swap you have will probably never be used.. nowadays though with huge hard disks there is no reason not to have alittle swap.. 100MB is more than enough if u have gig ram
[12:59] <RedNeckBoy> Canada WE Rock!
[12:59] <Angeluz> Skygge: Are you in a live-cd environment?
[12:59] <milage> Skygge, I was merely commenting on your choice of nick :p
[12:59] <ghostisgray> is there ATI video card support?
[12:59] <hyperactivecrond> RedNeckBoy: /join #ubuntu-ca
[12:59] <milage> As it means "Shadow" in my native language
[12:59] <skelter> hey all - I'm having some trouble where anything that uses hardware graphics acceleration (beryl, for instance) immediately crashes X. can anyone help me troubleshoot?
[12:59] <wastrel> DanaG:  #ubuntu-offtopic :] 
[12:59] <ghostisgray> and widescreen*
[12:59] <Angeluz> variant: No, it's not.
[01:00] <eternaljoy> variant: really? 100MB is enough?  I always used 1Gig swap.
[01:00] <bruenig> rhythmbox doesn't work, wine doesn't work, I get artifacts like crazy, what is the deal with feisty
[01:00] <Skygge> Angeluz, no, not live cd... edgy install
[01:00] <Dante123> I got the same error using canada server...so I changed to Main but still no dice.
[01:00] <Angeluz> Or I am doing something wrong.
[01:00] <Skygge> milage, my name? you know what it means?
[01:00] <sylvisj> How would I run the xubuntu installer?
[01:00] <milage> Indeed I do.
[01:00] <variant> eternaljoy: that is seriously excessive.. but you probably have 400GB hard disk so doesn't make any real difference
[01:00] <penguin42> eternaljoy: On some oldee Unix's you really needed as much swap as physical RAM - but that hasn't been true for years
[01:00] <magnetron> eternaljoy: i use 2GB swap, to be on the safe side ... =)
[01:00] <KNY> haha you jerks, I can't even install gnomebaker since the mirrors are thrashed :)
[01:00] <bruenig> sylvisj, I would recommend staying away from xubuntu, I fresh installed it and it is total crap
[01:00] <Angeluz> Skygge: Sorry, I confused you with sylvisj. :)
[01:00] <LjL> variant, eternaljoy: swap theoretically *always* improves performance. that's because, if you've got swap, the kernel can decide to swap out an unused process in favor of file caching. that holds even if you have 4 gigs of RAM, just as long as you've got more files than RAM
[01:00] <Skygge> Angeluz, np
[01:00] <bruenig> KNY, change to brazil
[01:01] <sylvisj> angeluz, the xubuntu desktop/install CD.
[01:01] <KNY> bruenig, it's going, just very slowly
[01:01] <magnetron> !slow | KNY
[01:01] <variant> eternaljoy: the 2times ram = swap size was true for computers with 32MB ram
[01:01] <ubotu> KNY: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[01:01] <LjL> variant: 100MB seems very little to me, especially considering that, for hibernation to work, you need swap to be at least as much as RAM
[01:01] <ghostisgray> is there ATI video card support? and widescreen resolutions?
[01:01] <KNY> not a huge deal
[01:01] <nir_ai> I have an nvidia 8800 GTX, and once I enable the nvidia driver and restart, the x server fails to start! how do I roll this back?
[01:01] <wehttamb> i did the "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" how do i know it it has upgraded from the beta?
[01:01] <penguin42> LjL: I also get the feeling sometimes the kernel just ain't happy without swap - I've seen machines feel very grindy without swap even when they don't use much when they have it
[01:01] <eternaljoy> ok ty
[01:01] <variant> LjL: ah, forgot all about hibernation etc.. that is a very good point that I totaly ignored.
[01:01] <Angeluz> sylvisj: So, you just booted without installing?
[01:01] <magnetron> !ATI | ghostisgray
[01:01] <variant> LjL: never use it my self :P
[01:01] <oth> Hi, noticed I don't have the command mail, what package should I apt-get to install it ?

[01:01] <breakthru> nir_ai: i have the same problem with a nvidia 6600
[01:01] <ubotu> ghostisgray: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:02] <Flannel> wehttamb: if youre upgrading from the beta, do a dist-upgrade not juts an upgrade.  And oyu'll know because no packages will be kept back
[01:02] <wastrel> oth:  mailx
[01:02] <sylvisj> Angeluz, yeah... there wasn't a specific install option
[01:02] <sylvisj> boot, and boot safegraphicsmode
[01:02] <Angeluz> ytsestef: Give me a seconds.
[01:02] <wehttamb>  i did the "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" how do i know it it has upgraded from the beta version of feisty
[01:02] <misfit-toy> Dante123, system/admin/software sources/ubuntu software/download from/  then pick the dropdown box, select "other", the "select best server", it will find the fastest server for YOU

[01:03] <Angeluz> sylvisj: Do the save one.
[01:03] <z987k> Hairulfr, download the torrent then just go about like your going to download it
[01:03] <Dybber> Is this: http://dybber.dk/Sk%A6rmbillede.png where i set which soundcard that should be used? It's not very intuitive! Is it the "Default Mixer Tracks" that I should change?
[01:03] <billl_> er mouse across the screen edge
[01:03] <z987k> Hairulfr, it should check the file and then seed
[01:03] <sylvisj> billl_, ctrl alt arrow
[01:03] <magnetron> billl_: ctrl + alt + arrows
[01:03] <ytsestef> Angeluz: didn't expect it to be that simple!! should have tried --help, hhehe! thanks!
[01:03] <sylvisj> Angeluz, did that, that's what I'm on

[01:03] <] Johnny[> for a casual linux user(meaning I'm in windows more than linux) would I notice a difference between edgy and feisty?
[01:04] <Dante123> misfit-toy.....I only see two options in my dropdown box......main server and server for USA
[01:04] <magnetron> billl_: does it work?
[01:04] <Angeluz> Don't forget to undo your changes in beryl-manager, if it doesn't do that by itself.
[01:04] <Enverex> LjL, Looks like you've got ~all~ the fun tonight ;)

[01:06] <etplayer_fiesty9> Looking for some help. My ubuntu (just started recently) is now pausing keyboard and mouse but only in FPS games.  Thanks in advance!
[01:06] <bruenig> whatever you do, don't upgrade xubuntu
[01:06] <bimberi> bruenig: got to/near 1600? wow.
[01:06] <peter77> didn't know that many ppl used ubuntu
[01:06] <foug> will there be an ubuntu 7.05?
[01:07] <Dybber> Is this: http://dybber.dk/Skaermbillede.png where i set which soundcard that should be used? It's not very intuitive! Is it the "Default Mixer Tracks" that I should change?
[01:07] <milage> I didn't see anything about that in the mouse preferences
[01:07] <sylvisj> Angeluz, so I pretty much just downloaded this one for nothing?
[01:07] <KNY> foug, no, it will be 7.10
[01:07] <bruenig> yeah it was at 1600 at about 6:30 this morning
[01:07] <mistone> lol where do they come up with the names for the realeases... Gutsy Gibbon wtf lol
[01:07] <TUTUx> wehttamb, sudo lsb_release -a
[01:07] <bimberi> foug: 7.10 is next
[01:07] <foug> KNY: rgr
[01:07] <luke_> why dont upgrade xubuntu?
[01:07] <KNY> foug, the numbering scheme is year.month :)
[01:07] <bruenig> 6:30 central time
[01:07] <foug> bimberi: so all the verions in between .04 and .10 will be beta?
[01:07] <magnetron> foug: next release is in october
[01:07] <wehttamb> ok what does that do
[01:07] <peter77> gusty gibbon
[01:07] <foug> KNY: ooo, makes sense now, heh
[01:07] <bimberi> mistone: from the mysterious recesses of Mark Shuttleworth's mind
[01:07] <KNY> foug, :)
[01:07] <comradeNikolai> nuked_omen: how do you know I am not a dog?
[01:07] <mistone> lol
[01:07] <Angeluz> sylvisj: I don't know, to be honest. But if none of the live-cd options work for you, you're forced to do the text-install. And that's on the alternate-cd.
[01:07] <bimberi> foug: no, no new versions, just updates to this one (7.04)
[01:08] <nuked_omen> is there a torrent file for 7.04, cuz the mirrors are hammered i think
[01:08] <nir_ai> how do I roll back, the failed nvidia installation? I have not X server now. do I need to re-install ubuntu?
[01:08] <TUTUx> wehttamb, tell you the version of your ubuntu
[01:08] <misfit-toy> some nice Beck and a full feisty, looks good, hell the beta only broke once for me.
[01:08] <sylvisj> Angeluz: Is there a way to just directly run the installer once I have the xorg.conf edited?
[01:08] <magnetron> nir_ai: did you try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg
[01:08] <Generic_TSS> hey ubuntu guys

[01:08] <kazuka> how is fiesty fawn doing?
[01:08] <bruenig> luke_, I did, garbage
[01:09] <Angeluz> kazuka: Pretty good so far.
[01:09] <Generic_TSS> anyone with an RT61 using feisty?
[01:09] <luke_> bruenig, grabage?
[01:09] <KNY> is there a way to specify a mirror with apt-get?
[01:09] <luke_> bruenig, what do you mean?
[01:09] <bruenig> luke_, artifacts like crazy, stuff crashing all over the place
[01:09] <kazuka> can you guys run vmware with it?
[01:09] <z987k> ytsestef, try installing alsa-oss
[01:09] <penfoldq> exit
[01:09] <lex_luthor> trying now
[01:09] <bimberi> KNY: no, you need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:09] <busfahrer> How do you get apt-get to do parallel fetching?
[01:09] <nir_ai> magnetron: yes. does not have any effect.
[01:09] <KNY> bimberi, dang, okay

[01:09] <Msakaji-zzZZ> KNY: edit /etc/apt/sources.list with privilidges
[01:09] <luke_> bruenig, oh dear
=== Msakaji-zzZZ is now known as Msakaji
[01:09] <Generic_TSS> yep Goldy
[01:10] <bruenig> luke_, and I have an integrated graphics card, very simple straightforward using the generic video card driver, and it still is awful
[01:10] <KNY> bimberi, I have the ISO, I just need to burn it :)
=== rootbitch is now known as L33
[01:10] <Goldy> well, im guessin g you will be able to get it working in feisty :P
[01:10] <etplayer_fiesty9> Any ideas about why mouse and keyboard events pause for several seconds?
[01:10] <Jovial_Jackass> can someone please help me removing a module that says it's in use?
[01:10] <Generic_TSS> ah ok, i was just wondering if there was a regression
[01:10] <luke_> bruenig, how was edgy ? did you upgrade or install?
[01:10] <Goldy> I have rt61 just not in my systme atm
[01:10] <bruenig> luke_, edgy was perfect, dapper was perfect
[01:10] <sahafeez> is there a doc that explains the choices between what kernel to install on the server version.
[01:10] <Jovial_Jackass> lsmod | grep 1394
[01:10] <bruenig> luke_, I installed
[01:10] <Jovial_Jackass> raw1394                30204  0

[01:10] <Jovial_Jackass> I need to remove dv1394
[01:10] <Generic_TSS> i heard a rumor the rt61 ralink modules wouldn't compile under feisty
[01:10] <Jovial_Jackass> it's not working after a suspend
[01:10] <comradeNikolai> dapper rocked the house
[01:11] <magnetron> nir_ai: looks like you have to edit the xorg.conf manually, it's not pretty
[01:11] <Jovial_Jackass> how do I do that?
[01:11] <bimberi> KNY: kk :) although note that you can only upgrade from the _alternate_ cd, not the desktop - it's for installs only
[01:11] <luke_> bruenig, oh.. dear I am downloading..
[01:11] <bruenig> luke_, even breezy was better than this, although for breezy I was using gnome still
[01:11] <Goldy> generic :  will put in my rt61 and try now :)
[01:11] <Jovial_Jackass> modprobe -r dv1394 says it's in use..
[01:11] <bobrik> hello, upgrade is totally stalled at file 1158/1410, what should I do? (will keep it running overnight work? :-)
[01:11] <Goldy> brbrr
[01:11] <the_rick> Is there an alternate CD install yet for Feisty?  I can't find it
[01:11] <nuked_omen> thanks a lot with the link :)
[01:11] <Tom47> i get "The Composite extension is not available" wheni click on Desktop Effects
[01:11] <nir_ai> magnetron: in what way?
[01:11] <busfahrer> Excuse me, apt-get update stalls at 'receiving headers'... any fix for that?
[01:11] <fucter> the_rick: yes, i downloaded it
[01:11] <StFS> just upgraded to feisty.... it's putting up a bit of a fight... working on resolving it... problems include: 1) hangs at boot time with "could not stat the resume device file" 2) resolvconf fails at boot time 3) powersaved fails at boot time.
[01:11] <sahafeez> the_rick: yes. i was bting today.
[01:11] <nol13> how do i get porn in unix?
[01:11] <Angeluz> Tom47: Which graphics card? Which driver?
[01:11] <busfahrer> How do you get apt-get to do parallel fetching?
[01:11] <luke_> bruenig, ok many thanks for your comment
[01:11] <penguin42> nol13: try finger
[01:11] <bruenig> nol13, web browser is your best bet
[01:11] <Msakaji> I have this issue with my ThinkPad R40e that has everybody stumped. I installed Feisty onto it today, to a clean disk, and for some reason the inputs lock up randomly every couple of seconds and completely miss my mouse movements and what I type. I've asked around and tried disabling ACPI, but no can do...
[01:11] <fucter> nol13: chuckfucter.com
[01:11] <bimberi> bobrik: leave it or interrupt, up to you.  if the latter it will resume when you redo it
[01:11] <Tom47> angeluz ati flgrx
[01:12] <sahafeez> anyone? which kernel docs on the server install?
[01:12] <armyriad> Guess what, guys? Feisty Fawn has been officially released!!!!
[01:12] <Angeluz> Tom47: The desktop effects need AIGLX.
[01:12] <Angeluz> armyriad: lol!
[01:12] <bimberi> armyriad: you don't say :)
[01:12] <Generic_TSS> yeah aiglx works
[01:12] <etplayer_fiesty9> Msakaji, I'm having similar behavior, mouse and keyboard pauses for several seconds but only in FPS apps.
[01:12] <Generic_TSS> i use that for beryl under edgy
[01:12] <Hairulfr> Oddly enough, im only seeding about 50 Kb/sec.. I'd figured it would be going about 200 at least
[01:12] <Msakaji> busfahrer: This is because the servers are under heavy load I think
[01:12] <armyriad> No, it has really been released.
[01:12] <bobrik> bimberi: thanks, that's exactly what I wanted to know
[01:12] <magnetron> nir_ai: there is a line: Driver "nvidia", edit it to be: Driver "nv"
[01:13] <breakthru> Tom47: with fglrx driver composite extension is disabled, so i'm using XGL + BERYL and it works
[01:13] <bimberi> bobrik: yw :)
[01:13] <luke_> guys, does anybody use opensees?
[01:13] <Msakaji> etplayer_fiesty9: For me it's system-wide, even in text mode and prior to loading X.
[01:13] <robin> anyone had any success with nvidia-glx-config enable in feisty?
[01:13] <alterlaszlo> DownloaD UsinG TorrentS
[01:13] <sahafeez> opensuse you mean

[01:13] <alterlaszlo> 200Kb
[01:13] <jared__> How do you change the video driver Beryl uses without loading it? Such as XGL/Nividia..  It freezes the desktop everytime I load it after I changed it
[01:13] <luke_> nono opensees sorry...
[01:13] <alterlaszlo> at least

[01:14] <etplayer_fiesty9> Msakaji, I think it was an update, because it worked flawlessly about 2 week ago and since prerelease 3

[01:15] <breakthru> ubotu: i tried to use the "envy" utility to install the driver and it has the same result
[01:15] <reckless> armyriad: shuttleworth is a billionare, he only dedicated 1 million to this
[01:15] <breakthru> ubotu: same result even installing with the NVIDIA-installer script
[01:15] <Msakaji> etplayer_fiesty9: Yes, I saw a forum post that mentioned that prior to a kernel update it worked fine. Of course, there's no way I'm going to downgrade the kernel on the feisty release; that'd be asking for trouble and breaking a whole load of other things.
[01:15] <bimberi> 10  million actually
[01:15] <penguin42> cheaper than a space flight and a lot more fun!

[01:25] <Generic_TSS> yeah they can be if you don't have the kernel headers
=== jovial_jackass_ is now known as Jovial_Jackass
[01:25] <Digital> what I'm getting is:
[01:25] <Digital> dlopen: /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1: undefined symbol: _nv000043gl
[01:25] <Digital> (EE) Failed to load /usr/lib/xorg/modules//libglx.so
[01:25] <Digital> and then it crashes and burns.
[01:25] <Angeluz> Tom47: You won't be able to use it without XGL.
[01:25] <penguin42> tato: This is the documentation for the 'ppdev' driver, there are some examples   http://people.redhat.com/twaugh/parport/html/ppdev.html
[01:25] <breakthru> Tom47: i have read that enabling composite disables direct rendering with fglrx drivers

[01:25] <magnetron> nir_ai: that's as much as i know...
[01:25] <Generic_TSS> ah jeeze, i can't help you there Direct
[01:25] <Generic_TSS> what is your card btw?
[01:25] <tato> penguin42: thanks
[01:26] <nu-> how can i install fluxbuntu?
[01:26] <mrpoundsign> only 17 hours to go!  yeah!
[01:26] <Ashex> so, anyone?
[01:26] <sylvisj> if only 7.04 detected the 8800gts as an 8800gts and didn't try to rape me using nv :(
[01:26] <bimberi> !fluxbuntu | nu-
[01:26] <Ashex> I'm able to browse it without problems using the ssh:// protocol
[01:26] <breakthru> sylvisj: does the nvidia driver work for you?
[01:26] <nu-> bimberi: nothing happened
[01:26] <ubotu> nu-: fluxbuntu is a LPAE-standard compliant, Ubuntu-based derivative that maintains the goal of running on a wide range of mobile devices and computers (low-end & high-end). It is lightweight, swift and efficient. | Support Channel: #fluxbuntu on freenode | Homepage: http://fluxbuntu.org/
[01:26] <nu-> !fluxbuntu
[01:26] <breakthru> i have a blank screen with nvidia drivers :( that happens on ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04
[01:26] <sylvisj> breakthru, I can't get far enough to tell you
[01:26] <bimberi> nu-: obotu is tired :)
[01:26] <bimberi> *ubotu
[01:27] <bimberi> !botsnack
[01:27] <ubotu> Yum!
[01:27] <Ashex> but i want to mount it to a folder so that I can have programs access it, right now only rythmbox is able to figure out how to handle ssh:// links
[01:27] <absum> i have a quick question, when my computer has been idleing for a bit the screen usually goes black, powersaving mode... but i've noticed a difference between 6.10 and 7.04, now i get a "check signal cable" when the screen goes black. Someone who knows why that might be?
[01:27] <void^> Ashex: use a samba or nfs share, or mount ssh using sshfs
[01:27] <robin> breakthru, are you by any chance using a generic kernel?
[01:27] <Ashex> sshfs?
[01:27] <breakthru> yes robin
[01:27] <void^> Ashex: yes, sshfs.
[01:27] <nu-> haha
[01:27] <hai3u> Ashex, Yes, sshfs.
[01:27] <robin> me to
[01:27] <KNY> oh. my. gosh. 7.04 loads a GUI via live CD on my laptop (this has never happened with any other release of ubuntu, ever) <33333
[01:27] <nu-> oboto is taking a nap
[01:27] <Ashex> void^, so mount -t sshfs foor /foo
[01:27] <robin> that seems to be an issue
[01:27] <breakthru> robin: the standard kernel that ships with ubuntu 7.04
[01:27] <Alan> why doesn't ubuntu have an /etc/init.d/iptables? and is there a way to get around it?  are rules automatically saved/loaded ?
[01:27] <rukuartic> KNY: The 6.10 gui didn't work?
[01:27] <Gold2> RT61 is working perfectly out of the box :)
[01:27] <nu-> but ok. i installed apt-get install kubuntu-desktop. but fluxbuntu-desktop didn't work
[01:27] <KNY> rukuartic, nope
[01:27] <Generic_TSS> ah nice!
[01:27] <crackintosh> im glad that im smart enough to change sources.list
[01:27] <Generic_TSS> thanks Goldy!
[01:27] <hai3u> Alan, Read the man page.
[01:27] <magnetron> !firewall | Alan
[01:27] <ubotu> Alan: Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[01:27] <noelferreira> what happened to NVU. I can't find it via synaptic in feisty? anyone knows anything about it?
[01:28] <Gold2> np
[01:28] <KNY> rukuartic, even Herd 4 didn't do it
[01:28] <void^> Ashex: no, it's fuse based. apt-get install sshfs.
[01:28] <Generic_TSS> cool man, i appreciate it
[01:28] <Gold2> /name Goldy
[01:28] <Gold2> lol

[01:28] <rukuartic> KNY: Wow O-o
[01:28] <Ashex> ah
[01:28] <Gold2> too many games :P
[01:28] <penguin42> magnetron: What seems to be different is that it doesn't install much by default
[01:28] <Ashex> void^, I'll install it
[01:28] <Tom47> Angeluz: breakthru ty will try and work my way thru t all
[01:28] <Generic_TSS> i had so much trouble with edgy, had to shoehorn the old ralink drivers into it
[01:28] <bimberi> KNY: cool.  that's a pretty typical linux experience, as your hardware gets older, support improves
[01:28] <StFS> what is the best way to find all the "c" packages... that is, the packages that have not been completely installed and are in "limbo"?
[01:29] <Ashex> void^, I'm assuming i should be able to google for details about sshfs?
[01:29] <IdleOne> nu-: try sudo apt-get install fluxbox
[01:29] <Generic_TSS> ok good luck everyone, peace out
[01:29] <rukuartic> Alright folks. I gotta split. To anyone involved in the development of 7.04, thank you so much. Your work is immensly appreciated!
[01:29] <Generic_TSS> peace Goldy

[01:29] <Angeluz> Tom47: You're welcome.
[01:29] <Chetwin> I'm having trouble with gaim crashing, can anyone assist me ???
[01:29] <KNY> it's a Toshiba Tablet PC
[01:29] <hai3u> Ashex, Of course. You could have googled in the first place.
[01:29] <chr_> Hello all, I have a partition  problems, is there anyone who can help me out?
[01:29] <Kagaru> linux sucks
[01:29] <Ashex> hai3u, I wasn't having much luck, kept getting suggestions to use NFS
[01:29] <absum> chr_: what is the problem?
[01:29] <penguin42> chr_: What type of problem?
[01:29] <Chetwin> Kagaru: Get a life and find an AOL room to bash
[01:29] <TaJMoX> Chetwin : have you ran gaim in a terminal and view the crash error ?
[01:29] <Angeluz> Kagaru: Then join #vista or something.
[01:29] <magnetron> !ohmy | Kagaru
[01:29] <rukuartic> Kagaru: Well you're certainly friendly...
[01:29] <ubotu> Kagaru: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:29] <breakthru> Kagaru: change kernel
[01:29] <nu-> IdleOne: that seem to have worked =)
[01:30] <Chetwin> TajMoX: No but I will now, thank you
[01:30] <Ashex> and I really don't want to setup a NFS server atm
[01:30] <void^> Ashex: it's easy to use, 'man sshfs' should suffice
[01:30] <Kagaru> i'm a windows user through and through till the day i die
[01:30] <nu-> installation seems to be frozen though
[01:30] <chr_> I tried to install xubuntu on my Dell Inspiron 8100 that is running Windows XP. I followed the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot. But something got messed up allong the way.
[01:30] <bimberi> KNY: k

[01:30] <Angeluz> Kagaru: Cute.
[01:30] <variant> Kagaru: thanks for sharing

[01:30] <Alan> hmm, thanks magnetron
[01:30] <Ashex> void^, just my luck, repos are being hammered :/
[01:30] <Kagaru> asking why you use linux and bash windows products
[01:30] <TaJMoX> Kagaru : i like hello kitty
[01:30] <nu-> How do i disable ubuntu desktop effects? i enabled it but cant disable
[01:30] <penguin42> chr_: OK, does it boot either of Linux or Windows?

[01:30] <etplayer_fiesty9> Msakaji, I think I'm blocked from private messages but I got them from you.
[01:31] <Chetwin> Kagaru: No one in here bashes windows.  Neither is inferior.  Just get over it and go back to paying for your software.
[01:31] <Kagaru> you only use linux because it's open-source and free, other than that you'd all stick with windows
[01:31] <KNY> etplayer_fiesty9, you have to register with Freenode
[01:31] <Msakaji> etplayer_fiesty9: Your nick isn't registered, then. Register it
[01:31] <IdleOne> !register > etplayer_fiesthank    (etplayer_fiesthank, see the private message from Ubotu) you 9
[01:31] <rukuartic> Kagaru: No trolling please.
[01:31] <feistyman> Can anyone answer this for me. I've had the Feisty beta for several weeks. Does it upgrade to the final release automatically?
[01:31] <variant> etplayer_fiesty9: you need to be registered with nickserv to send private messages
[01:31] <mjr> nu-, the enabler button is a toggle; press it again (I too think that was a poor choice for the UI)
[01:31] <etplayer_fiesty9> Msakaji, yes please file a bug report
[01:31] <etplayer_fiesty9> Ok, Thanks!
[01:31] <Chetwin> Kagaru: If you want to start a war, go elsewhere
[01:31] <mistone> chr_: do it with sudo
[01:31] <KNY> hmm... to install or not to install ....
[01:31] <stefg> !final | feistyman
[01:31] <ubotu> feistyman: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn), and haven't neglected to accept the automatic updates, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[01:31] <thekidrio> Kagaru, I stick with unix because I manage a very large network
[01:31] <variant> feistyman: i fyou keep it up to date then yes, you are already using feisty final :)
[01:32] <thekidrio> Kagaru, I use windows for games and unix for work
[01:32] <TaJMoX> Kagaru : Vista mentions nothing about being "Stable" or "Reliable"
[01:32] <respa> I installed ubuntu in /dev/sda6, but I got a debian in /dev/sda1 and I use lilo... is it possible to keep my lilo and boot the new ubuntu? I'm trying something like image=/mnt/ubuntu/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic root=/dev/sda6 label="ubuntu" in my lilo.conf but I got kernel panic
[01:32] <absum> chr_: you should probably use a windows based partition editing software resizing the ntfs partition... according to me
[01:32] <thekidrio> vista is a pain in my arse heh
[01:32] <Angeluz> TaJMoX: Let's just ignore the troll.
[01:32] <Kagaru> they keep saying windows sucks and that it is unsecure, but the last time i checked if you had the right security it can be a good OS to use... like i said, you will use whatever is free while i will purchase good products
[01:32] <Chetwin> Kagaru: I use linux because I have freedom of choice
[01:32] <riccardo> i can't be the only one running feisty on a dell 6400 with x1400 :-(

[01:33] <stefg> 's wrong with grub?
[01:33] <thekidrio> hrmm nothing about windows IIS mysql php install e h?
[01:33] <penguin42> respa: Remember that you need the initrd as well; also you'll have problems where Ubuntu updates it's kernel but won't update your other lilo config
[01:33] <slicknick> anyone seen rdesktop behave like this before?  http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=4g9bnd1
[01:33] <Chetwin> Oh man haha, even the updater is having trouble from the servers being pounded.  I love it
[01:33] <Chetwin> Go Mark Go!
[01:33] <penguin42> respa: Another solution is to get Ubuntu to install it's grub into the record of the partition ratehr than the mba and then get the lilo to boot ubuntu's grub
[01:33] <Kagaru> give me one good reason to use linux and don't say "because it's free"
[01:34] <jamiehd> Hi
[01:34] <wondering> How would I make a command line only LiveCD that's based on ubuntu-7.04-alternate.iso ?
[01:34] <wondering> It would be a custom CD.
[01:34] <Chetwin> Kagaru: For the same reason you use windows, because you can
[01:34] <jamiehd> Does anyone know how to get the system tray to show on the taskbar once it's been got rid of?
[01:34] <voyvf> Kagaru: because the source is freely available.
[01:34] <variant> Kagaru: give me one good reason not to? actualy, give me one good reason why this conversation doesn't belong in #ubuntu-offtopic
[01:34] <Chetwin> Kagaru: If you dislike linux so much, why do you care what we do with our machines
[01:34] <chr_> it boots to windows on the drive and linux on the CD.
[01:34] <wastrel> jamiehd:  you want to put it back?
[01:34] <bimberi> jamiehd: add a Notification Area applet to it
[01:34] <jamiehd> yeah
[01:34] <mjr> please, don't respond to the troll (namely Kagaru)
[01:35] <Chetwin> Kagaru is apparently an attn wh0re
[01:35] <wastrel> jamiehd:  right-click the bar, "add to panel"  notification area
[01:35] <feistyman> variant, can you or anyone suggest a good photo printing program?
[01:35] <nu-> mjr: ah, thanks
[01:35] <IdleOne> please stop feeding the trolls and focuz on helping Ubuntu users who need and actually use ubuntu
[01:35] <respa> penguin42 that solution seems nice.. do you know how do I set lilo to boot ubuntu's grub?
[01:35] <nu-> be right back
[01:35] <jamiehd> yep
[01:35] <IdleOne> focus
[01:35] <Kagaru> voyvf, open source or not, it makes no difference. you think it makes difference? why is Bill Gates/Microsoft continuing to lead the computer industry with Windows, and also do you know Bill laughs at people who use linux? because he doesn't care about it, linux will never takeover his business.
[01:35] <variant> feistyman: hmm, something specific to printing photos?
[01:35] <gils> boys and girls i need some help here...i have been using the beta and as soon as feisty came out today i cant get any updates. Do i need to change the repositories
[01:35] <penguin42> respa: No I don't know the details I'm afraid - I know with Grub I think I'd use a chainloader
[01:35] <variant> feistyman: gimp-print is supposedly good at printing images
[01:35] <Aarin> i've got a problem. in the instalation of my feisty on my pIV he asks for my hard disc controler. i've got an ATA and a SATA disk
[01:35] <ajehuk> Kagaru - define what you want and then make your choice - about the only thing windows will do better than linux is run windows software.. other than that I cant think of anyreason to use windows.  The only windows application I cannot replace with a linux application (free or otherwise) is visio, and theres crossover for that..
[01:35] <TaJMoX> wondering : same as the original live CD but with different boot options?
[01:35] <magnetron> !slow | gils

[01:35] <mistone> respa: lol why.... just use choose lilo or grub to boot linux or windows
[01:35] <voyvf> Kagaru: of course it makes a difference. i want to have the source for my OS. i couldn't care less what gates or microsoft think.

[01:36] <respa> penguin42 ok, how do I install grub in the MBR now? in the ubuntu installation grub didnt overwrite lilo
[01:36] <Chetwin> lol
[01:36] <variant> gils: if you have kept it up to date then there are no new updates to get, you are already using the latest version
[01:36] <zbrown> gils: Your repositories are already set. If you've been using it, you don't need to worry, you're on release.
[01:36] <gnomefreak> mjr: ?
[01:36] <PriceChild> mjr,
[01:36] <PriceChild> ?
[01:36] <Kagaru> ajehuk, my guess would be because windows is user-friendly, for families to enjoy, you know?
[01:36] <feistyman> variant, yeah, so far I haven't found anything I like that can print several photos on a sheet, etc.
[01:36] <Kagaru> because of that, it will always be bigger than linux.
[01:36] <gils> ok thanks all

[01:37] <carlo> I need help! I've upgraded to Feisty, and now the comp freezes just after selecting kernel 2.6.20-15, at "waiting for root filesystem". Kernel 2.6.17-11 boots fine, but clearly theres something wrong...
[01:37] <variant> sldkfj: with what error message exactly?
[01:37] <sakabatou> Is getting small
[01:37] <Random_Transit> hey, i'm having trouble upgrading to feisty, update manager stops with this error message: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty-security/main/binary-i386/Packages.bz2 Sub-process bzip2 returned an error code (2)
[01:37] <sldkfj> variant, heck I forget heh
[01:37] <respa> penguin42 should I boot from ubuntu cd to do that? I cant boot ubuntu at this moment
[01:37] <ajehuk> Kagaru - user friendly if you are used to using windows.. - but the point is - you have a choice.  I wouldnt say windows is more user friendly than any of the mainstream desktops available for linux
[01:37] <mjr> ajehuk, he's gone
[01:37] <variant> sldkfj: well, simple enough to replicate :)
[01:38] <Mr_Giraffe> ajehuk, i dunno about that...

[01:38] <ajehuk> Mr_Giraffe - how so?
[01:38] <Mr_Giraffe> i mean, a user-friendly distro for the masses would involve no command line whatsoever

[01:38] <penguin42> respa: Ah - if you can boot debian and then chroot into the ubuntu root you can probably run it from there, or you could install grub under your debian
[01:38] <StFS> Tell: sure... first tip... just ask the question... don't ask if you can ask
[01:38] <felicito> hello tigueres
[01:38] <Mr_Giraffe> ubuntu is definitely a step towards what the community should have for the masses, though
[01:39] <breakthru> did you read that article that says "linux is not windows" ?
[01:39] <sylvisj> I remember the debian sarge days
[01:39] <voyvf> yes, i can totally agree with that
[01:39] <Mr_Giraffe> i read some of it, but to be honest i thought it was too biased
[01:39] <felicito> how can I resize the ubuntu partition in a laptop with Windows too?
[01:39] <Tell> thanks =) basicly, Im installing linux for the first time (long-time thinker, seeing vista convinced me its time to move :P), and I found a decent amount of the drivers I need, but the network card driver I found was for a 6.x release.. is there any backwards compatibility for ubuntu7.04?
[01:39] <ajehuk> Mr_Giraffe - heres is the kicker - if you could buy a PC with ubuntu preloaded and all the hardware set up (much like OEM Windows) you wouldnt need to see the commandline..
[01:39] <TaJMoX> linux can be easy to use and still be linux.   its the kernel that really matters
[01:39] <Mr_Giraffe> felicito, 'sudo gparted'?
[01:39] <Mr_Giraffe> ajehuk, that's true...
[01:39] <respa> penguin42: well I tried chroot on the mounted folder (ubuntu) and I try grub-install /dev/sda and it says /dev/sda is not found..
[01:40] <magnetron> felicito: when installing, you get too chose how much of the drive space should be used for ubuntu
[01:40] <StFS> Tell: what network card do you have?
[01:40] <respa> penguin42: and /dev/sda is there here in debian
[01:40] <ryeth> tajmox:  what's the kernel??  ubuntu?
[01:40] <IncredibleHink> Why would my sound be working for the startup sounds but not for flash video (i.e. Youtube)?
[01:40] <voyvf> hm brb
[01:40] <felicito> Mr_Giraffe, ok, let me try, thanks
[01:40] <etplayer_fiesty9> If you have a /boot partition make it at least 200MB or you may run out of space.
[01:40] <Mr_Giraffe> ryeth, the kernel is what makes everything work, basically
[01:40] <wondering> How would I make a command line only LiveCD that's based on ubuntu-7.04-alternate.iso ?

[01:42] <wind0wsrawks> i was simply debating why linux sucks
[01:42] <chr_> penguin42 I ran  'chkdsk /f /r' on Windows and rebooot it TWICE! Then you can resize * * NTFS safely by additionally using the --bad-sectors option of ntfsresize.* and it seemed to resize the partition but the partition still showed up as being the full drive
[01:42] <Mr_Giraffe> command line output is bash i think
[01:42] <russe11> I just installed Feisty, and I have an ATI 200 Xpress card. I installed the package "xorg-driver-fglrx" and did the other stuff as directed(http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide#C ) but the driver isn't working.

[01:49] <kev_b> anybody getting an inexplicable "not enough free disk space" error??
[01:49] <ryeth> i'm a n00b  haha, sorry
[01:49] <aoirthoir> this isnt a codec issue

[01:49] <aoirthoir> i mean i dont get video...
[01:49] <disasm> wondering: it seems to be down though
[01:49] <aoirthoir> nada..no screen
[01:50] <wondering> Is that based on Feisty though?
[01:50] <Ltar> what is the "alternate" cd for fiesty? is that somehow different from... a standard version? I'm trying to upgrade with a CD, but nothing is happening. do I need to alternate CD?
[01:50] <Mr_Giraffe> ryeth, xq has it
[01:50] <ryeth> nickserv is where i enter my name?
[01:50] <radge> hiya everyone
[01:50] <duelboot> SubMOA, ahmed....SOME say that happens...hasn't happened to me or any of my friends that have used it, but YMMV
[01:50] <stefg> !alternate
[01:50] <ryeth> and then i have to type a password in?

[01:50] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.

[01:50] <livingdaylight> Flannel, huh, we don't have to mess about with source lists any longer?
[01:50] <ubotu> Yum!
[01:50] <Mr_Giraffe> ryeth, once you do that do /msg nickserv IDENTIFY <password>
[01:50] <ahmed> i have automatix and easy ubuntu, should i forget about upgrading ?
[01:50] <Flannel> livingdaylight: correct

[01:50] <livingdaylight> Flannel, hrmmm...
[01:50] <radge> anyone see this?
[01:50] <radge> :P
[01:50] <chemisus> anyone know where to find the md5sum value for fiesty iso?
[01:50] <alteroo> ] /part
[01:50] <deepsa> hi guys. i have installed ubuntu fiesty on my lenovo laptop but my screen resolution is not according to the widescreen (1280x800) it's 1024x768.
[01:50] <TaJMoX> radge : no
[01:50] <etplayer_fiesty9> aoirthoir sounds like an X issue, if you try several different live cds you can find one that initializes your screen and check the xconf.
[01:51] <umop> I have a directory with the permissions '?---------  ? ?      ?          ?        ? ' I can't change the permissions or delete the file, what can I do?
[01:51] <wondering> Flannel: That might do the trick. I will let you know.
[01:51] <ajehuk> mike1 - actually I think it hits on the same problem every distro has - the various linux desktops are so configurable that you need to ship something (with any distro) that is a good starting point.  unfortuinaltey I dont think there is a good starting point that works for everyone.  The good thing about u/kbuntu is that the defaults are "good enough", saying that most other variations would also probably just be "good enough".  The b
[01:51] <deepsa> still i need to install 915resolution? still fiesty haven't solved this problem?
[01:51] <pppoe_dude> umop, do that as root
[01:51] <Mr_Giraffe> deepsa, have you checked the forums?
[01:51] <Mr_Giraffe> i had a similar issue with my laptop before...
[01:51] <kev_b> apparently i don't have enough disk space on /usr to upgrade to feisty... but i do! ideas?
[01:51] <TaJMoX> umop : fsck
[01:51] <umop> pppoe_dude, Doesn't help.
[01:51] <VR_> has anyone burned any isos with "Infra Recorder" on windows? if so, how reliable is that?
[01:51] <SubMOA> duelboot, well that is reassuring.  Maybe I will try it... although, really, every bit of hardware is recognized, I have beryl running to my specs (which took FOREVER) and I'm pretty happy how things are going... maybe I won't mess with success
[01:51] <Goldy> umop, hcange the permission with CHMOD
[01:51] <pppoe_dude> deepsa, its not a feisty problem
[01:51] <ajehuk> mike1 - of something so massivley flexible...
[01:51] <Cactii> Anybody know if I can download the CD image and upgrade 6.10 from that???
[01:51] <chalcedony> hey does anyone know where GAIM puts it's logs?
[01:51] <umop> Goldy, No.
[01:51] <livingdaylight> Flannel, all non-free and proprietary mp3 flash etc is ready to go?
[01:51] <deepsa> well i guess i need to hand edit the x conf file
[01:51] <aoirthoir> etplayer_fiesty9: i didnt know there were several live cds.
[01:51] <xq> Is it in ~/.gaim/ ?
[01:51] <duelboot> SubMOA, just how do you get the cube to stop and see two sides of it?
[01:51] <Goldy> you are superuser yeah?
[01:51] <xq> Just a guess, not sure.
[01:51] <jrib> chalcedony: ~/.gaim/logs/
[01:52] <umop> TaJMoX, How do I do that?  I need to boot a live disc?
[01:52] <AnRkey> Cactii, no you need to upgrade twice
[01:52] <Ltar> where can I download the alternate CD? I don't see it anywhere on the ubntu site
[01:52] <magnetron> !alternate | Cactii
[01:52] <pppoe_dude> deepsa, more of a video bios on the graphics adapter side problem
[01:52] <ubotu> Cactii: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[01:52] <stefg> Cactii: you can, but use a torrent please http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
[01:52] <aoirthoir> etplayer_fiesty9: i will wait until next week then have ubuntu support step me through it. Thats what I pay them for:)
[01:52] <radge> does anyone know why i am having this problem...when i shut down the splash screen is half way across the screen and over laps the right side and part of it appears on the left side of the screen
[01:52] <jrib> Cactii: you can upgrade using the cd if you use the alternate cd only
[01:52] <jrib> !upgrade > Cactii    (Cactii, see the private message from ubotu)
[01:52] <etplayer_fiesty9> aoirthoir I have tried livecds from other distros just to get the config right in ubuntu depending on hardware.
[01:52] <Flannel> livingdaylight: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704tour  see for yourself
[01:52] <SubMOA> duelboot, sorry? What do you mean?  As in you want to move the cube so you see an edge and  the when you release the keys it stays?
[01:52] <TaJMoX> umop : sudo tune2fs -C 420
[01:52] <TaJMoX> umop : then reboot
[01:52] <voyvf> anyone have any ideas why,  since upgrading to feisty, my wifi drops every so often? it's a very consistent thing, so i'm thinking it's related to the new network manager, but i'm not sure where to look.
[01:52] <AnRkey> Cactii, sorry my mistake, not reading properly yes you can upgrade like that
[01:53] <umop> TaJMoX, Cheers.
[01:53] <TaJMoX> umop : it will take a while to load because the splash screen will cover the details of the check
[01:53] <TaJMoX> but
[01:53] <chalcedony> ty jrib xq
[01:53] <TaJMoX> ya
[01:53] <kneeki> Anyone know if it's possible via Ubuntu to have an 'active desktop'. As in, using video files for your wallpaper image?
[01:53] <Mr_Giraffe> voyvf, iwconfig and ifconfig don't do anything?
[01:53] <Tell> Wow, ubuntu detected my network card straight away and automatically started working through it, no configuration needed, straight online...thats pretty amazing. Will this change when I go to make the permainstall :P
[01:53] <ReSPiDeR> who was helping me with grub and lilo?
[01:53] <livingdaylight> Flannel, cheers.... looks like Feisty is very different then
[01:53] <radge> anyone?
[01:53] <aoirthoir> etplayer_fiesty9: ah ok I gotcha. Yeah it worked with dapper and edgy. So ima just wait:)
[01:53] <Mr_Giraffe> Tell, it should work automatically on a permanent install too
[01:53] <umop> TaJMoX, Okay, I'll be back if I still have problems ;)
[01:53] <duelboot> SubMOA, when I change desktops it simply moves to the second one...I've seen it where people stop the cube in the middle and you can "in essence" see both desktops...is that clear?
[01:53] <voyvf> Mr_Giraffe: they do,  in fact i scripted them because of how common my connection drops.
[01:53] <jrib> kneeki: mplayer can play videos on the root window
[01:53] <Ltar> I need a torrent or download link for the alternate CD
[01:53] <Tell> awesome. So I open up the install on the desktop, and it'll format the drives for me too?
[01:54] <magnetron> !torrents
[01:54] <ubotu> Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[01:54] <TaJMoX> kneeki : there is a x root display...nautilus usually sits there
[01:54] <voyvf> but my wifi device drops about every 20 min or so.
=== CapaH2 is now known as CapaH
[01:54] <radge> does anyone know why i am having this problem...when i shut down the splash screen is half way across the screen and over laps the right side and part of it appears on the left side of the screen
[01:54] <kneeki> TaJMoX: Hmm. x root display, I've never  heard of this.
[01:54] <Mr_Giraffe> voyf, this is just a guess, but maybe it's trying to refresh the connection and can't quite make it?
[01:54] <duelboot> voyvf, has it dropped for a while?
[01:54] <Mr_Giraffe> voyvf, what make is your router?
[01:54] <voyvf> duelboot: it dropped while i was asking this question :D
[01:54] <CapaH> Hi all, question -- why does CTRL+F8 not switch to another session?
[01:54] <duelboot> voyvf, you may need to change your channel to avoid interference
[01:54] <mrpoundsign> can I mount BSD formatted partitions in ubuntu?
[01:54] <voyvf> linksys
[01:54] <xq> Or what's the chipset on the card?
[01:54] <TaJMoX> kneeki er its called root window
[01:55] <Mr_Giraffe> voyf, is it a WRT54G?
[01:55] <duelboot> SubMOA, any answer?
[01:55] <xq> mrpoundsign, aye
[01:55] <ajehuk> Mr_Giraffe - voyf - just thinking about powersaving etc.. is the card in use in that period or is it a drop due to inactivity?
[01:55] <voyvf> chipset is rt2500, router is wrt54g
[01:55] <stefg> radge: seems that the driver is adressing more menory than you have in your graphics card
[01:55] <kneeki> TaJMoX: Hmm, does it function like the windows version 'Dream Scene'?
[01:55] <CapaH> When I ctrl+f8 instead of seeing a new session I see a bunch of white on black text with [failed]  at the bottom --- apparently the tail of some log file from who knows when
[01:55] <voyvf> but this didn't happen until after the upgrade to feisty, likely along with the kernel update.
[01:55] <stefg> radge: or a sync problem of your monitor
[01:55] <mrpoundsign> xq: cool, any special packages needed?  I am going to try and put this disk in a USB case to load some data off it.
[01:55] <duelboot> voyvf, what I meant was...has it been doing this  a while or just recently?
[01:55] <voyvf> just since upgrading to feisty
[01:55] <Mr_Giraffe> duelboot, he said since he upgraded
[01:56] <SubMOA> duelboot, I send you a message
[01:56] <duelboot> Mr_Giraffe, sorry had missed the first part which is why I asked
[01:56] <Mr_Giraffe> oh, i wasn't saying that in a mean way
[01:56] <voyvf> i was an early feisty adopter, but i'm updated completely now :D
[01:56] <Mr_Giraffe> sorry bout that
[01:56] <duelboot> np
[01:56] <duelboot> same here
[01:56] <TaJMoX> kneeki : i think xv can play on the root window
[01:56] <SubMOA> duelboot, did you get it?
[01:56] <livingdaylight> Flannel, is Feisty awesome?
[01:56] <kneeki> TaJMoX: Hmm, thanks!
[01:56] <TaJMoX> kneeki : xv -root
[01:56] <chemisus> anyone know where to find the md5sum value for fiesty iso?
[01:56] <Mr_Giraffe> anyway, voyf + duelboot, i used to have that problem with my wrt54g, try changing/upgrading the firmware
[01:56] <duelboot> SubMOA, no...lemme register...hold on
[01:56] <breakthru> how do i configure the processor speed?
[01:57] <jrib> chemisus: there is an MD5SUMS file on all the mirrors
[01:57] <SubMOA> ohh, ok.
[01:57] <atoponce> chemisus: check the mirrors
=== Spec is now known as x-spec-t
[01:57] <chemisus> ok, thanks
[01:57] <radge> what would i do to fix it? its not so much of a problem just an annoyance
[01:57] <voyvf> Mr_Giraffe: i'll try that as a last resort. i hate to admit it, but i hadn't thought of changing the channel
[01:57] <duelboot> SubMOA, never got the message...am am registered
[01:57] <SubMOA> ok
[01:57] <Mr_Giraffe> voyf, try that too :P
[01:57] <duelboot> voyvf, it probably won't matter as that would only work if a router nearby is causing interference
[01:58] <duelboot> voyvf, shouldn't be related to the upgrade
[01:58] <Flannel> livingdaylight: I imagine so
[01:58] <etplayer_fiesty9> Anybody know where the local logs are for synaptic updates?  One of them booched my mouse.
[01:58] <voyvf> ah no,  i'm the only one when i do iwlist ra0 scan
[01:58] <dimeotane> anyone got a bcm4318 wifi card working in feisty yet?
[01:58] <livingdaylight> Flannel, why what are you using?
[01:58] <duelboot> SubMOA, I didn't get the message...are you registered?
[01:58] <SubMOA> duelboot... forget that :O)  First, try pressing <ctrl><alt>"LeftClick" (hold  left click)
[01:58] <Flannel> livingdaylight: dapper
[01:58] <SubMOA> duelboot, maybe not... I thuoght I was...
[01:58] <xtknight> etplayer_fiesty9, /var/log/dpkg.log
[01:58] <SubMOA> duelboot, then move the mouse around
[01:59] <aoirthoir> later peeps
[01:59] <SubMOA> duelboot, anything?
[01:59] <ajehuk> Mr_Giraffe voyvf dualboot - if its a wrt box looking at dd-wrt is a god idea anyway... although I cant see why the router would cause the drop if it is only happening 'after' an upgrade.. - I still suggest it may be a powersave on idle issue that has recently been implemented for the driver - there are a few other people reporting periods of inactivity leading to connection drops...
[01:59] <livingdaylight> Flannel, what?! please tell me you are kiddin!

[02:00] <atoponce> blanky: right. they both install the same software, just the method is different

[02:01] <Flannel> blanky: right.  they both (well, when you choose the normal install on the altCD) install the same thing
[02:01] <ajehuk> voyvf - seen it for both rt2500 and rt73

[02:01] <SubMOA> duelboot, by chance, do you know... I want to use this file manager: "http://www.forchheimer.se/bfm/" but if I don't like it, will it ruin Nautilus or overwrite anything or... well, is it ok to just try out or is it more permanent?
[02:01] <Mr_Giraffe> foug, get the data off and make it FAT?
[02:02] <wondering> Flannel: I'm checking out all the steps, but so far it seems very 6.06 specific.
[02:02] <foug> Mr_Giraffe: ehhh, not a possibility
[02:02] <Flannel> wondering: The steps are the same for whatever version.
[02:02] <ajehuk> foug - how are you mounting it?
[02:02] <voyvf> there was an extreme speed up, but considering how much gnu software was updated, as well as the kernel, it's hard to put a finger on just what did it. :D
[02:02] <Mr_Giraffe> SubMOA, maybe what you could do is compile it and then run it from the folder to try it
[02:02] <Sterk> noone?
[02:02] <Flannel> wondering: its just that the version numbers/stuff has changed

[02:04] <Mr_Giraffe> taiger, i don't know, i haven't used it
[02:04] <Mr_Giraffe> but i guess it crashes or locks up sometimes
[02:04] <Mr_Giraffe> it also said that KDE is slower
[02:04] <duelboot> Sterk, have you installed wpasupplicant?
[02:04] <etplayer_fiesty9> Where would I look up this package change? xserver-xorg-input-all

[02:04] <Mr_Giraffe> as for gnome, taiger, it's not as amazing (apparently) but it's more stable
[02:04] <duelboot> Sterk, that's the problem
[02:04] <ajehuk> fuog - I assume its automatic then, could you paste the contents of your /etc/fstab into a pastebin so that I can take a quik look at how and with what paramaters the drive is being mounted? -> http://pastebin.ca or similar

[02:08] <IncredibleHink> jrib, however when i goto the 32bit version it says 1.5

[02:08] <jrib> IncredibleHink: what version of ubuntu?
[02:08] <duelboot> Sterk, it may be installed by default...I think it is...but you must configure it...the link above will show you how

[02:09] <etplayer_fiesty9> noelferreira, you can use fish:// if you are using konqueror or ssh:// if you are going directly, winscp is nice if you need to use windows.
[02:09] <jrib> IncredibleHink: ok, how did you install 32bit firefox?
[02:09] <TheoMurpse> I'm trying to upgrade Ubuntu. In update manager I select upgrade to 7.04, and then it proceeds to download or whatever the first 20 of 40 files. On 21, it hangs up. Then I get "Error during update" "failed to fetch http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/...". Is it failing because servers are down or is it failing because I have a 3rd party package repository listed?
[02:09] <homanj> atoponce: btw, i enjoy reading your blog via planet ubuntu
[02:09] <wastrel> i don't know who invented flash

[02:12] <hai3u> elvenseven, Uh, what's wrong with it?
[02:12] <disasm> wind0wsrawks: actaully the funny thing is why someone would waste their time in a linux chat room just to bash it, someone like that must really not have a life, let alone a girlfriend
[02:12] <emet> freenode is going to crash
[02:12] <livingdaylight> iamelite, ?
[02:12] <IncredibleHink> jrib, it said it installed and Synaptic Manager says its there, but when i open the browser it still says 1.5 in the about
[02:12] <fucter> teoma29: me too
[02:12] <wind0wsrawks> IdleOne, the average linux junkie has nothing good to say about windows, so why can't i defend it and confront you about it?

[02:12] <h3h_timo> zilly6, i cant open up ports

[02:12] <duelboot> livingdaylight, sweet...if you like to mess with backgrounds... :)
[02:12] <etplayer_fiesty9> Thanks All! I appreciate the help and community.
[02:12] <h3h_timo> zilly6, it goes wayyyy to slow

[02:12] <gumjo> does anyone else have problems in fiesty with updates/synaptic
[02:12] <hai3u> wind0wsrawks, Sorry, Ubuntu does not accept criticism.
[02:12] <duelboot> livingdaylight, I just used the Ubuntu LAMP and Joomla
[02:12] <IdleOne> wind0wsrawks, you arent defending windows your putting down linux
[02:12] <zilly6> wind0wsrawks then defend it, don't diss ubuntu
[02:12] <atoponce> wind0wsrawks: if you're here for ubuntu support or help, you're welcome to stay
[02:12] <TheoMurpse> stefg that's what I figured, but I wanted to verify that could be a cause before wasting any more time troubleshooting.
[02:12] <iamelite> <livingdaylight> nvm

[02:12] <duelboot> livingdaylight, good enough for me
[02:12] <Tell> is that windowsrawks git still here?
[02:13] <wind0wsrawks> so it's ok for you guys to bash windows but then when someone says something about it you get angry and say it's unacceptable behavior

[02:13] <wind0wsrawks> gothcha
[02:13] <ffm> noelferreira: Yes..

[02:14] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[02:14] <ajehuk> wind0wsrawks - not having anything good to say != bashing

[02:14] <h3h_timo> zilly6, kinda like bittorrent i guess
[02:14] <h3h_timo> just wanted to try it
[02:14] <hagabaka> oh
[02:14] <Tell> funny how ubuntu managed to pick up on my soundcard and network card, vista, the promised mother of OS's, almost died when it saw them. Oh, and ubuntu/beryl looks sexy
[02:14] <zilly6> what about tor?
[02:14] <Tell> aero is bloody ugly.
[02:14] <IncredibleHink> jrib, i just need sound with flash9
[02:14] <hagabaka> i see, thanks
[02:14] <duelboot> hai3u get a life...I didn't bash either...you are the weakest link...goodbye
[02:14] <maccam94> hi wind0wsrawks
[02:15] <AnRkey> wind0wsrawks, this is not the place to debate the windows/linux bit mate
[02:15] <Kragnerac> wind0wsrawks: Having fun? :P
[02:15] <Mr_Giraffe> Tell, you've talked about that 3 times now
[02:15] <wind0wsrawks> Tell, BUY MORE RAM to use vista
[02:15] <zilly6> enough about windows guys
[02:15] <wind0wsrawks> it's not rocket science
[02:15] <magnetron> !jigdo | zilly6
[02:15] <hai3u> duelboot, Real nice argument there.
[02:15] <ubotu> zilly6: jigdo is the jigsaw downloader for building cd isos. for more information see http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/
[02:15] <wind0wsrawks> and it's well worth the money
[02:15] <IncredibleHink> jrib, i have edited the firefoxrc file and changed "none" to "alsaoss" for firefoxDSP
[02:15] <hype_> hi :)
[02:15] <maccam94> wind0wsrawks, join #ubuntu-offtopic
[02:15] <iamelite> <duelboot> how the heck do you bash ubuntu. or do u mean $bash in ubuntu
[02:15] <Enverex> wind0wsrawks, You're not "defending Windows" though, you're just trolling. Defending would mean giving educated statements as to why something is invalid/valid.
[02:15] <zilly6> thanks magnetron
[02:15] <IncredibleHink> jrib, but thats as far as I have gotten
[02:15] <ffm> hai3u: I actualy never called him that, if you look up. Some others were. I was just answering his ? about what they were.
[02:15] <duelboot> lol iamelite
[02:15] <voyvf> ah.. the next time someone argues with me about torrent being only good for pirating software, i'll try to remind them of the 10k torrent extravaganza due to the feisty release
[02:15] <wind0wsrawks> Enverex, i have many reasons to use
[02:15] <h3h_timo> wind0wsrawks, ive used vista for a while and still prefer ubuntu over it ;/
[02:15] <duelboot> iamelite, I didn't bash anything...but
[02:15] <Tell> RAM wont make windows vista detect my drivers automatically. And I have 2.5gb DDR2, I dont see how an OS cant run on 2.5ddr
[02:15] <fucter> word voyvf
[02:15] <steve_> why can't i unmaximize windows once i maximize them?
[02:15] <Hatty> Enverex: And those statements themselves would be invalid.
[02:16] <zilly6> so anyone with ISO->USBlive ?
[02:16] <maccam94> haha, the feisty swarm is huge atm. 5000+ seeders, 3000+ leechers
[02:16] <hype_> anybody using a mx518 on feisty? any problem regnognising all buttons?
[02:16] <magnetron> !offtopic
[02:16] <duelboot> thanks jrib bout time
[02:16] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[02:16] <gumjo> wind0wsrawks, you dont have to tell people people to buy more RAM for Vista. its a requirement for most ppl upgrading to it
[02:16] <thornomad> Hi -- was hoping for some help implementing the libtrash package with openssh-server.  I have libtrash successfully working in the command line and with netatalk (afp) ... however, I don't know where to call the "export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libtrash/libtrash.so.2.4" command for my ssh mounts.  For netatalk I added it to: /etc/init.d/netatalk and for the CLI I modified: /etc/profile ... but I don't know what to do about ssh ... modifying /e
[02:16] <slamBrick> Help Help Help I broke my software sources list ho do I fix it???
[02:16] <iamelite> god i need a keyboard on this pda!
[02:16] <wind0wsrawks> The Linux Guru's keep saying windows has flaws, is unsecure, blah blah blah. GET A BETTER SECURITY SYSTEM/FIREWALL.
[02:16] <jon__> anyone have any suggestions on how to recover from a failed do-release-upgrade on edgy server? mine keeps seg faulting when it is "checking package manager" now :(
[02:16] <jrib> IncredibleHink: I don't know why your sound wouldn't work
[02:16] <maccam94> gumjo, the troll's been kicked ;-)
[02:16] <IncredibleHink> jrib, hmm
[02:16] <duelboot> slamBrick, did you backup first? :(
[02:16] <wastrel> !easysource > slamBrick
[02:16] <IncredibleHink> jrib, it works in everything else
[02:16] <[acid] Neatchee> Hey guys, I have a question about upgrading:  I upped to Feisty like 3 weeks ago through "update-manager -c -d" and I was kind of assuming that there'd be some new updates today with the official release, but there aren't :O  Is that standard, or am I missing something?
[02:17] <iamelite> windows isnt flawed, it does precisely wat gates wants.
[02:17] <AnRkey> wind0wsrawks, Ubuntu server and desktop is saving me about 9000's and I don't have problems with DRM and such, that good enough reason?
[02:17] <duelboot> SubMOA, any luck?
[02:17] <cubicism> [acid] Neatchee: Duhhhhh, you need to get the iso.
[02:17] <zilly6> he's gone anrkey
[02:17] <magnetron> !final | [acid] Neatchee
[02:17] <ubotu> [acid] Neatchee: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn), and haven't neglected to accept the automatic updates, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[02:17] <sylvisj> Do you guys recommend ReiserFS or Ext3?
[02:17] <IdleOne> [acid] Neatchee, that ws it. as long as you kept up to date you had final release 3/4 days ago
[02:17] <voyvf> ok, i'll take my offtopicing to the offtopic section (: or at least i'll try
[02:17] <sylvisj> I'm a gamer if that matters
[02:17] <SubMOA> duelboot, opps... not really... did you look at the link?
[02:17] <AnRkey> zilly6, thank god :D
[02:17] <Enverex> sylvisj, EXT3
[02:17] <moDumass> hey all i cant keep cairo-clock open without term being open too, its like it opens the clock but doesnt return, so i cant type exit to close the terminal
[02:17] <bigstart> hey!
[02:17] <disasm> sylvisj: ext3
[02:17] <[acid] Neatchee> yay! Thanks guys :)
[02:17] <moDumass> any ideas?
[02:17] <voyvf> ext3 works for me
[02:17] <jrib> IncredibleHink: did you ever have flash playing sound?
[02:18] <duelboot> SubMOA, send PM and I'll walk you through it
[02:18] <h3h_timo> does anyone know how to scan for open ports on my schools network so i can pick the best one for azureus to use??

[02:18] <SubMOA> duelboot, PM?

[02:18] <duelboot> SubMOA, private message
[02:18] <zilly6> anyone have a guide to creating a bootable usbdrive ffrom livecd ISO ?
[02:18] <disasm> h3h_timo: well, if you have root nmap, but don't do that...
[02:18] <gumjo> moDumass, use the "Run" application to execut cairo-clock
[02:18] <magnetron> !nmap | h3h_timo
[02:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nmap - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:18] <sylvisj> Any particular reason for ext3 over reiserfs?
[02:18] <SubMOA> duelboot, I would appreciate the help.. Ok, one sec
[02:18] <voyvf> h3h_timo: port scanning might be a legal nono in some areas. be careful.
[02:18] <magnetron> !info nmap | h3h_timo

I installed xorg-fglrx on my PC with FF 7.04 and when i initialized a hot bootstrap operation, My GUI was incapable of accuratly displaying color, shape or even pixilation of any kind. The image was black and void of form.
[02:22] <moDumass> hmm, these preferences you speak of, where would i find them,?
[02:22] <IncredibleHink> jrib, yes i do - version 1.0.13-1ubuntu5
[02:23] <tuxedo_kamen> listen... I was wondering if there are any games freely available for Ubuntu
[02:23] <linos> can someone help
[02:23] <magnetron> iamelite: you are chatting here with your PDA?

[02:27] <[acid] Neatchee> anyone else notice that the new network-manager doesn't work nicely with ndiswrapper?  I can't seem to get it to recognize that my wireless card is even installed :O
[02:27] <ringo11_> X doesnt start w/ fglrx  (radeon x1300)
[02:27] <misfit-toy> tuxedo_kamen, why? you can always UNinstall it if it isn't up to your enormous standards.
[02:28] <ringo11_> all you have to do is modify xorg.conf though
=== _cappiz is now known as cappiz
[02:28] <jrib> Malachi: ok, can you repeat your question?  I thought you just wanted the alt cd faster
[02:28] <bimberi> ep2011: the feisty install is fine afaik.  any links to your info?
[02:28] <teoma29> Is tty_io.c a needed file in linux headers file, something to do with busybox error on boot and I dont have that file
[02:28] <bimberi> *installer
[02:28] <ep2011> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=140
[02:28] <jrib> IncredibleHink: you can try: http://motls.blogspot.com/2007/01/adobe-flash-9-for-linux-sound.html but these are just guesses
[02:28] <Kickersny> anyone know if we're going to see stats on # of times Feisty was downloaded and such?
[02:28] <iamelite> <ringo11_> do you mean to tell me that when i install Ubuntu, it doesnt initialy have the fglrx drive?
[02:28] <Malachi> jrib:  I'm going to be gone tomorrow so I need to finish Feisty today. I downloaded the alt to install it faster (did that with Edgy, too), but it connects to the internet and downloads files from there.
[02:28] <bimberi> ep2011: thanks, taking a look
[02:28] <Kickersny> I'd love to see it graphed out per hour
[02:28] <Malachi> jrib: My CD drive isn't even going.
[02:29] <ringo11_> well what i think happened is it tried to use fglrx drivers before they were enabled
[02:29] <[acid] Neatchee> The new Network-Manager doesn't seem to like ndiswrapper! I'm able to get my wireless working through CLI use of ndiswrapper, wpasupplicant, ifconfig, and dhclient, but I'd like to have the network manager recognize it.  The 3rd party tool "wicd" also has no problem recognizing the device.  What gives?
[02:29] <ringo11_> so X crashed
[02:29] <jrib> Malachi: ah, was the cd repository added?
[02:29] <Taime1> is there a way to reconfigure beryl?
[02:29] <Malachi> jrib: yes.
[02:29] <ringo11_> i just switched to vesa in xorg.conf and did a manual startx
[02:29] <elvenseven> BYE IM GONNA BUY VISTA :(
[02:29] <Kickersny> bye, elvenseven
[02:29] <SubMOA> did anybody see that?
[02:29] <misfit-toy> [acid] Neatchee, there will probably be a new NM soon, it's just finicky....
[02:29] <steve_> how do i change to another desktop when i have effects turned on?  i want to see what the cube looks like
[02:30] <ringo11_> ctrl+alt+left/right
[02:30] <SubMOA> duelboot, do yuo have AIM or something?
[02:30] <AnRkey> anyone know how to get a userlist in xchat?
[02:30] <iamelite> <ringo11_> so what i should do, is apt get the drivers... initialize them. then dkpg-reconfigure  xorg.conf and select the driver fglrx?
[02:30] <Enron> I can't send mails, using mail command and nothing is showing up in mail.log
[02:30] <jrib> Malachi: is it listed first in your sources.list?
[02:30] <steve_> ok theres definitely something wrong with my graphics drivers or something :(
[02:30] <[acid] Neatchee> AnRkey: PM me.  I use xchat
[02:30] <ffm> HOW CAN I make my computer execute a command ON BOOT in a TERMINAL as ME?
[02:30] <Malachi> Let me check, I did the software sources.
[02:30] <ringo11_> that should probably work
[02:30] <duelboot> SubMOA, no worries...just do it here...BTW here's another site...http://doc.gwos.org/  although it's not responding at the moment
[02:30] <magnetron> AnRkey, it is already there (to the right)
[02:30] <faksor> hi all
[02:30] <Hairulfr> Night all
[02:31] <Mr_Giraffe> magnetron, he might want a list list
[02:31] <iamelite> <ringo11_> Thank you mate. I do appreciate that. Lets assume i did that.
[02:31] <faksor> congrats on feisty release!
[02:31] <jrib> Malachi: hmm, actually I am reading the instructions now.  It should ask you to install from the cd when you pop it in
[02:31] <duelboot> SubMOA, go to a command line and type the following...
[02:31] <Mr_Giraffe> like a textfile
[02:31] <ringo11_> ok
[02:31] <AnRkey> ok
[02:31] <magnetron> <Mr_Giraffe>: oh
[02:31] <garlik42> n #ubuntu-connecticut
[02:31] <SubMOA> duelboot, ok, thanks.  Wow... what away to start a little adventure... with failure ;O)
[02:31] <SubMOA> duelboot, ok
[02:31] <bimberi> ep2011: going by that, both install and upgrading have issues.  This is always likely given the myriad of hardware and configurations possible.  The installer has been tested and has worked for many.
[02:31] <SubMOA> duelboot, btw, did you check out the link?
[02:31] <iamelite> <ringo11_> lets say, it diddnt work.
[02:31] <steve_> i have a 5 button mouse and only 3 buttons were detected.  is there a way to redetect the buttons?
[02:31] <jrib> Malachi: and if it doesn't do so, you are supposed to run: gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" .  I'm reading: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[02:31] <tuxedo_kamen> misfit-toy, I have a download limit >_>
[02:31] <duelboot> which on SubMOA sorry
[02:32] <Malachi> jrib: It doesn't, and I do run that command.
[02:32] <Malachi> jrib: It seems that it does begin to install from the CD, but just connects to the internet and downloads files.
[02:32] <iamelite> im going to res-tard into my install now. Ill see you soon
[02:32] <richdurhm> hey guys im getting a bunch of errors when upgrading
[02:32] <SubMOA> duelboot, http://www.forchheimer.se/bfm/
[02:32] <bsnider> anybody know how to set up an nfs share when the directory name has two words?
[02:32] <SubMOA> duelboot, thats what I'm trying to get
[02:32] <ringo11_> Oh I also removed several modules from xorg.conf like dri and a few others that i cant remember, jus trial and error
[02:32] <Malachi> jrib: The CD drive _did_ spin at the beginning, though.
[02:32] <jrib> Malachi: are you sure it isn't grabbing uploads for packages that you installed outside of main?

[02:34] <Mudoch> good evening, I have a question regarding DNS hostname broadcast.  My Ubuntu desktop is hostname xyztest but My XP box can not find it. The DHCP client list in the router provides no name
[02:34] <Malachi> jrib: No, I'm not.
[02:34] <[acid] Neatchee> AnRkey: PM me.  I use xchat
[02:34] <Malachi> jrib: Hold on.
[02:34] <Malachi> jrib: How can I cancel  the current upgrade process?
[02:34] <bsnider> bimberi: already tried it, no-go
[02:35] <NET||abuse> hehehe, just resurrected my ooooold ipod mini and rockboxed it... weeee fun
[02:35] <bimberi> bsnider: kk :/
[02:35] <jasin> Many servers are failing.
[02:35] <AnObfuscator> I got disconnected, before I got a response to this question ... Ubuntu really doesn't want to install on this computer... after trying 2 burns of the alt CD, I'm using the Live CD. It boots into gnome, then says "resource fork unavailable" when I try to use any menu items... when I hit alt-F1 for a console and try to type bash commands, it gives the same error... what gives?
[02:35] <jrib> Malachi: hmm if it is only downloading things, it may not matter if you stop it.  But I am not familiar with what the gui does when it starts upgrading so I can't tell you for sure

[02:35] <Taime1> ryeth: play with your settings a bit...
[02:35] <AnObfuscator> I did verify it
[02:36] <fluid> jrib: downloads all of the packages, then does the upgrade after it successfully gets them all
[02:36] <[acid] Neatchee> magnetron: my god samba is SUCH a paaaain to get working right.
[02:36] <jasin> downloading upgrades via bit torrent is stupid.
[02:36] <duelboot> okay SubMOA, I looked at it, but don't know enough to know what it will do...but seems sorta cool...now back to WPA
[02:36] <Malachi> jrib: How? I guess xkill?
[02:36] <[acid] Neatchee> I spent literally like 3 days trying to get it working in the most bare bones fashion
[02:36] <Mudoch> not really, I'm doing website building and want to test using IE and Netscape
[02:36] <bimberi> AnObfuscator: kk, did you try the verify in the boot menu as well?
[02:36] <SubMOA> duelboot, ut oh... WPA?
[02:36] <AnObfuscator> yeah
[02:36] <magnetron> Mudoch: hmm ok
[02:36] <jrib> fluid: so it should be ok for Malachi to just kill it?
[02:36] <AnObfuscator> and I burned it at 4x
[02:36] <duelboot> weren't you looking at WPA?
[02:36] <SubMOA> duelboot, I'm thinking you might have me confused with someone else :O)
[02:36] <jasin> wpa works here
[02:36] <ringo11_> can anyone tell me the name of that porn download accelerator that was in edgy?  i really need it for feisty
[02:36] <NET||abuse> ryeth, I find my volume can get higher than in windows
[02:36] <matt__> feisty rocks
[02:36] <fluid> jrib: should be just fine if its not installing them
[02:36] <duelboot> okay SubMOA sorry
[02:36] <ryeth> damn really?
[02:36] <ryeth> haha
[02:37] <bimberi> AnObfuscator: hmmk starting to sound like a bug :|
[02:37] <SubMOA> duelboot, all wires on this rig ;O)

[02:37] <SubMOA> duelboot, np, thanks for offer of help, at least
[02:37] <Malachi> Mkay.
[02:37] <fluid> jrib: sounds like he is still downloading, and slowly id wager. hehe
[02:37] <AnObfuscator> maybe the download is bad
[02:37] <duelboot> Sterk, any luck with WPA
[02:37] <ytsestef> hi there, how can i switch from aiglx to xgl? when I instal the fglrx beryl just stops working...
[02:37] <matt__> NET||abuse: imagine edgy, or even dapper, it is 10 times better
[02:37] <Mr_Giraffe> AnObfuscator, i wouldn't doubt it
[02:37] <matt__> NET||abuse: faster, more stable
[02:37] <Malachi> Gonna log out for a minute; have to do something first, jrib. I'll be back.
[02:37] <AnObfuscator> I haven't had as good of luck with bittorrent downloads
[02:37] <duelboot> SubMOA, I definitely confused you with Sterk...sorry
[02:37] <ytsestef> ( i have ati radeon 9600xt)
[02:37] <Absolution_Xx> Finally got Feisty to work!
[02:37] <NET||abuse> matt__, haha,, fun, how about gettin amd64 to work with flash & java
[02:37] <SubMOA> duelboot, ha, np
[02:37] <duelboot> Sterk, WPA working?  Need assistance?
[02:37] <magnetron> Mudoch: you basically have 2 options: of your router is a DNS server: add the ubuntu box manually. if it isn't, then add it to the HOSTS file in Windows
[02:38] <jasin> I keep getting a failed with http;//archive.ubuntu.com feisty-security
[02:38] <AnObfuscator> I'll try 6.10 and do a dist-upgrade later, I suppose. thanks for the response
[02:38] <jasin> and many other servers
[02:38] <matt__> NET||abuse: well, not sure about that, but i'm sure its possible
[02:38] <[acid] Neatchee> For anyone having problems getting WPA working, I HIGHLY recommend a third party program called "wicd"  It is very very good,  if you don't mind replacing network-manager(-gnome)
[02:38] <kalikiana|d> I am trying to login to my ubuntu live cd from winxp. But I can not enter a user and a password, meaning I set a smbpasswd and but it is rejected.
[02:38] <effie_jayx> anyone know if I have been using feisty since HERD2
[02:38] <NET||abuse> matt__, :) saw something about deps being a bit broken for java 6 on feisty
[02:38] <effie_jayx> should I keep the instalaction I have ... or
[02:38] <DigitalNinja> is something going on with the repository servers? when I do "apt-get update" it doesn't get all of them

To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[02:39] <Mudoch> magnetron, thought so...   Is it that netbios is actually doing the broadcast?
[02:39] <richdurhm> what should i do
[02:39] <richdurhm> ?
[02:39] <jasin> oh well, it'll be a good weekend project

[02:43] <Pelo> !mp3 | TheIronChef
[02:43] <NET||abuse> TheIronChef, look up the mp3 codecs.. what'r they called again. :)
[02:43] <TheIronChef> just installed it ... im completely new :
[02:43] <csmanx> I need a post-install fix, I have ubuntu and xp installed already
[02:43] <jrib> TheIronChef: hmm, when you double click on an mp3 it doesn't ask you to install codecs?
[02:43] <sebas_> TheIronChef, you have to install mp3 codecs

[02:43] <duelboot> TheIronChef, pray...just kidding (although that would probably work too)_
[02:43] <ytsestef> NET||abuse, the open drivers are installed out of the box in ubuntu feisty, right? so what do I need to get beryl work under xgl instead of aiglx?
[02:43] <magnetron> !codecs | TheIronChef
[02:43] <NET||abuse> ytsestef, lotsa xorg.conf fiddling :)
[02:44] <Mudoch> magnetron, would SAMBA provide the name resolution I seek?  For now I do use a static IP just thought there was a way to get into the DHCP client list on the router
[02:44] <khatahn> is there any text editor that is good in handling huge text files?
[02:44] <steve_> ok.  only thing not working now is beryl
[02:44] <Pelo> I guess we won'T have to bother installing  audio codecs either now with fiesty or is it just video ?
[02:44] <csmanx> so, anybody? dualboot on already installed ubuntu and win xp
[02:44] <NET||abuse> ytsestef, I'd go through it a bit with ya now, but i gotta go sort out a faulty server just now.
[02:44] <neozen> jasin: just be glad you aren't trying to download xubuntu
[02:44] <steve_> anyone got a nvidia 7300gt?
[02:44] <Frog29> Hey - any way to isntall feisty fawn without internet? (or can someone help me get my wireless working JUSt so i can update :) )
[02:44] <neozen> jasin: that's only on one server... and is slower the #@$#@$@#$@
[02:44] <teoma29> csmanx I do
[02:44] <ytsestef> NET||abuse, only that? no packages to download?
[02:44] <sebas_> why can't I upgrade to feisty right now?
[02:44] <Frog29> *ubdate
[02:44] <Pelo> csmanx,  what is the atual question ?
[02:44] <jasin> i'm already at 30% in the download
[02:44] <ryeth> i thought the /list command shows list of channels??
[02:44] <jrib> khatahn: something like sed would be best.  vim does a decent job if you turn off syntax highlighting
[02:44] <Gnahhhh> i think my isp keeps kicking me off the internet or something.  this is the first time i've used bit torrent and i keep getting disconnected
[02:44] <andyrobo>  when I am running berly I lose the option to send open windows to other workspaces in the drop down menu you get by right clicking on them, is this normal for feisty??
[02:44] <Gnahhhh> Frog29, what chipset?
[02:44] <ytsestef> NET|abuse, ok don't worry. any wiki please???
[02:44] <NET||abuse> ytsestef, go to the www.beryl-project.org wiki and go through the setup details :)
[02:45] <Pelo> andyrobo,   ask in #beryl
[02:45] <magnetron> Mudoch, samba is handling netbios names, it wont help in your case.
[02:45] <jasin> why would I want xubuntu? I have 2 gigs a ram and a 3ghz cpu
[02:45] <ResPiDeR> what package should I install to get stdio.h stdlib.h etc? include files for C programming language
[02:45] <khatahn> jrib: i was afraid the answer would be sed ;)
[02:45] <jikanter> Frog29: I was wondering the same thing, I think it has something to do with the amount of traffic on the site
[02:45] <Frog29> Gnahhhh broadcom
[02:45] <NET||abuse> ytsestef, there's prolly just somat in there that's not done right for your setup ;)
[02:45] <csmanx> Pelo: I had ubuntu installed first, then xp was installed, grub was overwritten by ntldr, need dual boot
[02:45] <jikanter> ResPiDeR: try glibc
[02:45] <wastrel> ResPiDeR:  install build-essential
[02:45] <Frog29> I'm just wondering if i can update wihtout internet access... maybe from a CD
[02:45] <Gnahhhh> Frog29, do lspci -v | grep bcm
[02:45] <khatahn> jrib: ah, i tried vim but it choked on the file, but i'll have to try disabling highlighting then
[02:45] <Pelo> csmanx,  you need to either reinstall grub from the live cd or add windows to the grub menu
[02:45] <magnetron> Mudoch, This seems more like a problem of configuring the windows box
[02:45] <jijutm> hi all.. I am real newbie to ubuntu
[02:45] <jrib> khatahn: how big?
[02:45] <dboy> hey guys just new to ubuntu thought I'd pop in and see what I can learn
[02:45] <jikanter> Frog29: yeah, use apt-cdrom
[02:45] <ryeth> jijutmn:  me, too man lol
[02:46] <jijutm> just switched from Redhat
[02:46] <funkyHat> Is the bonjour protocol plugin going to use avahi rather than howl when pidgin is released?
[02:46] <garryFre> Frog29 Are you getting gross degradation of download speed when trying dist-update as well?
[02:46] <jamiehd> hi
[02:46] <jijutm> and am confused
[02:46] <Frog29> Gnahhhh - i've done something like that 0 its broadcom corporation unknown device 4311
[02:46] <Pelo> jijutm,   welcome to the channel
[02:46] <neozen> jijutm: welcome to the fold
[02:46] <ryeth> i've never even used red hat
[02:46] <khatahn> jrib: ~130MB
[02:46] <CD_zzzzz> gooooo  7.04
[02:46] <Pie-rate> hey guys, i set up ubuntu for my mother on a 1920x1200 screen, the screen she's using now is 1280x1024. on the bootsplash, the monitor says OUT OF RANGE until its finished booting
[02:46] <ryeth> i'm used to windows lol
[02:46] <jijutm> in certian things
[02:46] <dboy> on live cd right now but resolution is set too low
[02:46] <neozen> jijutm: apt is your friend
[02:46] <Pie-rate> how can i fix that so it shows the bootsplash?
[02:46] <jrib> khatahn: yeah vim should handle that fine
[02:46] <jijutm> yup... I did find it quite helpful
[02:46] <Frog29> garryfre - i can't try that - i don't have internet access working from 6.10
[02:46] <NET||abuse> hmmm, how robust is the ipod mini G1, i'm really rough on portable gear :)
[02:46] <ResPiDeR> jikanter wastrel thanks
[02:46] <Gnahhhh> Frog29, i don't have any quick fixes for that sorry
[02:46] <jijutm> still
[02:46] <makiolo> i love ubuntu :D
[02:46] <funkyHat> oops wrong channel
[02:46] <CD_zzzzz> what should i do an upgrade from beta or a fresh install  hmmm
[02:46] <kalikiana|d> I am trying to login to my ubuntu live cd from winxp. But when I enter a user and a password it is not accepted. I set a smbpasswd.
[02:46] <khatahn> jrib: ok, thanks
[02:46] <Frog29> gnahhhh thanks
[02:46] <dave__> so i open update manager, click upgrade, and it just sits there
[02:46] <steve_> do people recommend installing automatix2?
[02:46] <ytsestef> any linux user is capable of coping with any distro. besides, ubuntu is a piece of cake
[02:46] <Tell> ubuntu finished installing..Im really impressed ^^
[02:46] <dave__> any ideas?
[02:46] <Pelo> jijutm,   condidering the amount of traffic in the channel today it would help if you made your statement /quesiton in one go
[02:46] <Mudoch> Ok, right now I'm upgrading to 7.04, So far so...... Anyway the screen keeps going to sleep and I want it to stay on any quick hints what to change?
[02:46] <jamiehd> I'm setting feisty downloading onto my laptop overnight, but I sleep in the same room. Is there any way to make the screen go black, but leave the update running?
[02:46] <magnetron> !final
[02:46] <ubotu> If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[02:47] <TheoMurpse> Wow, the servers really are taking a hit. Right now my upgrade says 14 hours left to finish the upgrade. :(
[02:47] <Pelo> CD_zzzzz,  what ever you are more comfortable with
[02:47] <SubMOA> duelboot, can you repeat the last thing yu osaid to me... if you can still find it?  Sorry is tepped away for a moment and it is gone
[02:47] <Pie-rate> jamiehd: press the monitor button on your laptop?
[02:47] <Frog29> so - is there any way to update to feisty fawn without internet access?
[02:47] <ryeth> anybody know how i can update my xchat to the latest version?
[02:47] <jamiehd> I tried
[02:47] <jamiehd> It did nothing
[02:47] <Stormx2> jrib: Doesn't seem to work at all.
[02:47] <CD_zzzzz> pelo  fresh i think would be a nice start   thanks
[02:47] <jijutm> I am having 6.10 on my server and 7.04 on the desktops ( we made a switch from Win XP last week), and I need php 5.2.1 on the server..
[02:47] <TheIronChef> whoever helped theironchef... thank you!
[02:47] <Pelo> Frog29,   do it from the alternate install cd
[02:47] <jasin> kalikiana|d,  the live cd does not run from windows it runs off the cd. You boot off it during startup, ubuntu does not depend on any other os.
[02:47] <matt__> ryeth: have you ever tried out irssi, i like it a whole lot more that xchat
[02:47] <TheoMurpse> Frog29 i think there is an "alternate" cd you can download
[02:47] <duelboot> Simply said...there is a safe mode to BFM that *should* be fine...but I'm no expert SubMOA
[02:47] <jrib> Stormx2: try ; instead of && or just write a short script
[02:47] <magnetron> Frog29: you can order the CD through ShipIt
[02:47] <Frog29> Pelo - will i have to reisntall or will it be an update?
[02:47] <Pie-rate> hey guys, i set up ubuntu for my mother on a 1920x1200 screen, the screen she's using now is 1280x1024. on the bootsplash, the monitor says OUT OF RANGE until its finished booting
[02:47] <Pie-rate> how can i fix that so it shows the bootsplash?
[02:48] <ryeth> no i haven't.....what makes irssi better?
[02:48] <steve_> so feisty is using totem to play my mp3s but don't most linux users or xmms or something like that?
[02:48] <garryFre> Frog29 Oh, I hat 6.10 and lost that version when the upgrade to the new Ubuntu stalled and I had to restore and to my horror I thought I had backed up 6.10 but did not so I got to start all over from 6.6
[02:48] <steve_> whats the app of choice?
[02:48] <Stormx2> ; didn't work either! bah!
[02:48] <jijutm> but cant find any way to install php 5.2.1 with soap and SDO
[02:48] <ixian_> hello i just mounted a fat32 partition in ubuntu, i can read/write all folders on it except the 'My Music'  folder, anyone know how i can fix that?
[02:48] <matt__> ryeth: you open terminal to use it, within terminal, it is extremely lightweight, but sort of more "geekish" than xchat
[02:48] <Pelo> jijutm,   sudp apt-cache  search  keyword  ,find the package you need and  sudo apt-get install package name
[02:48] <matt__> ryeth: try this, sudo apt-get install irssi
[02:48] <kalikiana|d> jasin, I am sorry. my question was unclear. I am logging in via samba.
[02:48] <GluE> strange... the 7.04 i just d/led and burned today, wont work on my ubuntu box, but other cd's will.. and it works fine in windows ie. autorun.
[02:48] <ryeth> i don't care about the "geekish" part haha
[02:48] <SubMOA> duelboot, oOo, gotcha... maybe I'll make a junk folder and just play around theree :O)
=== CD_zzzzz is now known as Cabldevilk
[02:48] <Cabldevilk> brb doing fresh install
[02:49] <ryeth> okay, and then do i sudo apt-get remove xchat  ?
[02:49] <duelboot> SubMOA, now that's a great idea
[02:49] <NET||abuse> weeeeee,,, so many mini games on my ipod,,, this is coool
[02:49] <matt__> Cabldevilk: good luck
[02:49] <Frog29> so a revision of my question :) - can you UPDATE 6.10 using the altrenate cd? or can you just reisntall it?
[02:49] <jamiehd> Anyone?
[02:49] <matt__> ryeth: if you like irssi
[02:49] <[acid] Neatchee> Okay, kind of silly question....anyone have any preferred login/logout sounds?  I hate the ones that come with ubuntu -_-;;
[02:49] <jrib> !upgrade > Frog29    (Frog29, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:49] <Tom47> steve totem is steadily improving and is the preferred ubuntu app .... o personally find that vlc is good too
[02:49] <jijutm> ok pelo i will try that..
[02:49] <ryeth> okay, just making sure that's the right command
[02:49] <jrib> Frog29: yes to both questions
[02:49] <fluid> only console irc clients ive used are old-school ircii, and bitchx...never looked at that one. i might tho...xchat makes me feel dirty. lol
[02:49] <steve_> oh ok
[02:49] <magnetron> !alternate | Frog29
[02:49] <ubotu> Frog29: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[02:49] <TheIronChef> anyone know a good dreamweaver alterneative?
[02:49] <[acid] Neatchee> fluid: what's wrong with xchat?  I like xchat ^^;
[02:49] <Frog29> k - thanks
[02:49] <Pie-rate> HOLY ****ING CRAP, wireless JUST WORKS on my laptop with feisty. AWESOME

[02:49] <Frog29> jrib - thanks
[02:50] <jikanter> Pie-rate: welcome to ubuntu
[02:50] <neozen> Pie-rate: atheros or intel 3945abg?
[02:50] <[acid] Neatchee> Pie-rate: 'grats.  Wish it did for me :(  What wireless card do you use?
[02:50] <Pie-rate> atheros
[02:50] <steve_> is there a better irc client than xchat-gnome?  i hate it
[02:50] <oth> Pie-rate, heh I'm on wireless a long time ago
[02:50] <jijutm> just another thought.. would it be possible to hire some one for specific things.. like creating a preseed file
[02:50] <ryeth> i'm installing kudoku-desktop so i can have KDE and GNOME and it's still got an hour left
[02:50] <ryeth> so i can't do any commands
[02:50] <fluid> actually last night for the heck of it, i used mirc for about 30 seconds under wine...that felt a lot more dirty this...lol
[02:50] <Pie-rate> it did not by ANY MEANS "just work" on edgy
[02:50] <Frog29> anyone have some good routes to downlaod Ubunto 7.04 other than slowly through the main servers?
[02:50] <W|cked> e296e3468358789904097fc8df29609a
[02:50] <garryFre> Anyone else getting gross network stalling when trying to upgrade from Dapper to 7.04? It goes from an hour to 12 days in 30 minutes and then just stops.
[02:50] <Pelo> steve_,   xchat  ,  you can install if from synatpic and it will remove xchat-gnome
[02:50] <jrib> ryeth: why can't you do any commands?
[02:50] <neozen> feisty better play nice w/ my intel..... or I'm going to hit it with a stick
[02:50] <jasin> Samaba is for networking with windows not logging into ubuntu.
[02:50] <magnetron> !torrents | Frog29
[02:50] <Pelo> Frog29,   torrents
[02:50] <ubotu> Frog29: Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[02:50] <ryeth> cause it's in the middle of installing something
[02:50] <steve_> i see..ok brb
[02:50] <Malachi> jrib: I made sure that all of the feisty servers were commented out. Now I get this:
[02:50] <Malachi> A unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade.
[02:50] <ryeth> everytime i type something it doesn't work
[02:50] <Frog29> ah! so fast - thanks
[02:51] <neozen> restricted driver or not.. its worked just fine since dapper
[02:51] <fluid> id enjoy gnome-xchat a lot more if i could figure out how to get a nick-list on permanently. lol
[02:51] <[acid] Neatchee> Okay, kind of silly question....anyone have any preferred login/logout sounds?  I hate the ones that come with ubuntu -_-;;

[02:51] <mister_roboto> [acid] Neatchee: i prefer to just never log out
[02:51] <fluid> so you cant do it in this one? i had never seen it, figured id look at it ...no loss, just been looking for the nick list. lol
[02:51] <Frog29> does feisty fawn have better wireless support? or was it unchanged? (or are there release notes? )
[02:51] <jrib> Malachi: are you using local mirrors for your repositories?
[02:51] <garryFre> Yeah, I've killed it three times and had to restore. After 3 hours of this I think patience dictates that I wait a few days
[02:51] <AaronM> Ok, im talking to you now from the live cd on the install part where i select partitions. I need help setting those up. This computer is going to be using ubuntu only (no windows). I have a 120 GB HDD and a 60 GB HDD. The 120 GB is my master and the other is my slave. What would be good partitions and sizes etc? They still have the NTFS partitions left over btw.
[02:52] <[acid] Neatchee> Frog29: MUCh better wireless support
[02:52] <ryeth> matt:  just learned what ntfs-3g was yesterday :)
[02:52] <Frog29> nice
[02:52] <[acid] Neatchee> still not perfect, but much better :P
[02:52] <matt__> ryeth: once you get used to using it for a lot of tasks, your productivity goes up.

[02:52] <jijutm> Pelo: could i hire some one to make me a preseed file for pxe installs
[02:52] <matt__> ryeth: isn't that so that you can access and write to ntfs partitions?
[02:52] <ryeth> i'm still trying to learn ;)

[02:52] <wilo> is there a problem with the Ubuntu software updates?
[02:52] <Frog29> Will upgrading ubuntu mess up existing program options?
[02:53] <magnetron> !slow | wilo
[02:53] <ubotu> wilo: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[02:53] <jrib> Malachi: make sure your sources.list points to local mirrors.  So if you have archive.ubuntu.com, change it to us.archive.ubuntu.com if you are in the United States.  leave security alone.  That's pretty much all you can do
[02:53] <jijutm> I was asking whether I could hire some expert ubuntuians to make me a preseed file
[02:53] <jasin> Mount the ntfs drive dont use samaba.

[02:54] <slop> Frog29: i found one other person in the forums that suggested it was a problem with grub settings...unfortunately, i have never messed with grub settings...can you remember what you did to fix it?
[02:54] <jrib> !nvidia > Tell    (Tell, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:54] <Crazytom> yay
[02:54] <Mudoch> FYI my dln is running about 35 kb/s
[02:54] <disasm> Tell: apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic
[02:54] <Pelo> Tell,  terminal    menu > application > acessories
[02:55] <Pharsalus> I can't find the link for synaptic
[02:55] <kde185> disasm: I'm talking about KVM virtualization, not the hardware peripheral
[02:55] <locolbd> hey can any tell me how i can make a folder hidden?
[02:55] <garryFre> getting error 17 with grub frog?
[02:55] <disasm> Tell: don't use the official nvidia drivers
[02:55] <kalikiana> disasm: yes, I wanted to copy the files over with samba.
[02:55] <TheIronChef> weird... when i try to get hte new codecs it jsut sits on 1/3 upgrades and doesnt dl...
[02:55] <disasm> kde185: oh ;-)
[02:55] <PocketIRC> <Frog29> worse wireless support in feisty..
[02:55] <Frog29> slop - all i can say is when your in grub and choosing what to boot look at all of the settings and make sure it boots to the right partitions,etc.
[02:55] <jrib> locolbd: put a  .  in front of its name
[02:55] <disasm> kde185: I think I've made that problem before
[02:55] <Pelo> Pharsalus,  not a link,  a menu entry
[02:55] <locolbd> ok
[02:55] <locolbd> thanks
[02:55] <magnetron> Pharsalus: you are using Kubuntu, right?
[02:55] <jrib> locolbd: or do you jsut want it hidden in the gui?
[02:55] <Frog29> garryfre - i used to be :)
[02:55] <Pharsalus> Yes, using kubuntu
[02:55] <Ax4> well i lost my entire /home directory
[02:55] <Ax4> f a b u l o u s
[02:55] <slop> Frog29: thanks, i'll have a look at that...it's ESC to get into grub, right?
[02:55] <kde185> disasm: yeah...it makes googling for it a pain
[02:55] <Pelo> TheIronChef,   the servers are a bit busy right now , a lot of ppl are upgrading
[02:55] <jijutm> kde185: I just finished setting up xp in zen .. and it is cool
[02:55] <Frog29> slop - i think so....... i have it dual booting so i'm always in grub
[02:56] <steve_> test
[02:56] <Pelo> Pharsalus,   you want adelpt then ,  don'T know where it is
[02:56] <disasm> kalikiana: if smbfs is included on the live cd (I have no idea) you can mount a windows fs like so: mount //winpc/share /mnt   and then copy all over to /mnt
[02:56] <BHSPitMonkey> ok, so I have a box here... it has no video output.  I'd like to be able to install *ubuntu and immediately ssh into it, is this easily doable?
[02:56] <slop> Frog29: awesome, thanks again
[02:56] <Frog29> slop - i g2g so i can't help you anymore
[02:56] <Frog29> :)
[02:56] <pipeline_> hey, got the new livecd.... anyone know of an issue when using parallels where the livecd will start up to the linux: prompt.... and after hitting enter it just stays at a black screen?
[02:56] <TheIronChef> lol alright... that suckss ... i just wanna hear music :(
[02:56] <zen> jijutm, XP is not inside me, thank you very much!
[02:56] <steve_> ahh much better
[02:56] <ixian_> whats the command to set all files/folders to read/write for all users on a particular mount point? for example /media/Stuff
[02:56] <Oatmeat> are there any visual scp programs?
[02:56] <jijutm> haa!
[02:56] <kde185> jijutm: so is that easy to do? I've heard that KVM is better/faster but if it won't work...
[02:56] <Pelo> pipeline_,   try the alternate install cd
[02:56] <Pelo> pipeline_,  it's text based
[02:56] <TheIronChef> is a  wine already installed on feisty?
[02:56] <Mudoch> jijutm, xp in xen??? as in winxp running under ubuntu?
[02:57] <jijutm> yes..
[02:57] <pipeline_> Pelo: okie... previous versions have worked, does that make any difference?
[02:57] <disasm> kalikiana: if that doesn't work, get a live cd with a ssh server (http://www.insert.cd) start the ssh server and us something like winscp to login to the linux computer (running live cd) and get all the files that way
[02:57] <mister_roboto> pipeline_: do you get the text prompt with <ctl><alt><f1-f6>?
[02:57] <jrib> TheIronChef: it's in the repositories, but not installed by default
[02:57] <jijutm> Mudoch: yes
[02:57] <magnetron> TheIronChef: wine 0.9.33 is in the repository
[02:57] <TheIronChef> kk thank you jrib
[02:57] <Pelo> ixian_,     chmod ,   check the man page for info
[02:57] <TheIronChef> and magnetron lol
[02:57] <natham> hi, is there any software to unpack the .msi files?
[02:57] <disasm> mister_roboto: that's normal, that's how you get a virtual console
[02:57] <Pelo> pipeline_,  might be a borked cd
[02:57] <Ionix> it's so ridiculous... The ubuntu website is flooded. and navigating around the link is so SO slow~, unbelievable the torrent file is downloading at 0.1k/s
[02:57] <Mudoch> jijutm,  will VB run then?
[02:57] <jijutm> kde185: It took around 15min to figure out.. and the normal install time
[02:57] <jrib> !wine > TheIronChef    (TheIronChef, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:57] <disasm> mister_roboto: you can get back to X with ctrl alt f7
[02:57] <Ashex> anyone know of a firefox plugin that looks up a word when highlighted?
[02:57] <jijutm> I did not check..
[02:57] <Ashex> like a dictionary search?
[02:57] <BHSPitMonkey> TheIronChef, winehq also maintains their own deb repository, which you can add to your software sources, so that you always have the latest.
[02:57] <mister_roboto> disasm: it would mean that the system fully booted but his X isn't working.  that is NOT normal
[02:57] <pipeline_> mister_roboto: yes... ctrl-alt-f1 shows [     0.000000]  ACPI: Unable to locate RSDP
[02:57] <yell0w> hey folks, where can i find minimum requirement for feisty ?
[02:57] <pipeline_> Loading please wait....
[02:58] <jasin> I wont run xp on this laptop.
[02:58] <jijutm> needed the bloody IE 7 to test out some of our websites..
[02:58] <Pie-rate> can i just install feisty straight to my flash drive with no tricks?
[02:58] <pipeline_> but it's been there for like 10 mins
[02:58] <disasm> Ionix: try ftp.osuosl.org, I've gotten fairly fast downloads there
[02:58] <kde185> jijutm: ok well, if I fail to figure out KVM then I'll find out how to do that thanks
[02:58] <kalikiana> disasm: I was wanting to provide the shares from the livecd.
[02:58] <yell0w> !requirements
[02:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about requirements - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:58] <Pelo> Ashex,  you can do a search of the firefox pluggin page
[02:58] <yell0w> !requirement
[02:58] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about requirement - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:58] <mister_roboto> pipeline_: hmmm that's even worse. your system didn't finish booting if you're not at a login prompt
[02:58] <disasm> oh, I thought you said he hit ctrl alt f1-f6 to get a terminal
[02:58] <stylus> there is a language update (en) which doesn't seem to work? can i still install 7.04 without that particular update?
[02:58] <TheIronChef> YAY i finally got my mp3 codecs!
[02:58] <jijutm> kde185: I got the guidance from howtoforge.org
[02:58] <disasm> mister_roboto: ^^ addresed to you
[02:58] <pipeline_> mister_roboto: i'll redownload :)
[02:58] <Ionix> disasm thanks.
[02:58] <jijutm> dont remember the exact url
[02:58] <nikitis_> So uh,  how do I upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 with a 7.04 cd?
[02:58] <Ashex> Pelo, I'm looking at it right now. I was just curious if someone already knew of one
[02:59] <jrib> !upgrade > nikitis_    (nikitis_, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:59] <Ionix> debian?
[02:59] <Mudoch> jijutm,,, it's a burden we all must suffer.... Bill gate may the fleas of a thousand camels infest your home

[02:59] <bayziders> Whats going on with the upgrade speeds? I'm geting 45 kbs on T1
[02:59] <jeah> Can anyone recommend some documentation for me to look at regarding heat issues on my laptop?
[02:59] <icyhot> I just upgraded to feisty.  I had Beryl running just fine before but now it's not working and I'm missing window decorations.  Any ideas?
[03:00] <magnetron> !slow | bayziders
[03:00] <ubotu> bayziders: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[03:00] <disasm> kalikiana: ah, I doubt smb server would be on the live cd, if it is, you'll have a file /etc/samba/smb.conf, if that doesn't exist, most likely you can't do it without downloading a samba package, but I'm not sure how big the ramdisk is that houses the file system
[03:00] <TheIronChef> this is weird getting used to ... ive used xp since the day it came out and jsut installed feisty today... kinda different :(
[03:00] <Pelo> Frog29,  you can find a torrent easily enought on your favorite torrent site,   the community has been very good at uploading them

[03:00] <bayziders> magnetron: thanks
[03:00] <iamelite> hi everyone im back
[03:00] <Crazytom> is there a good gui for burning iso's other than k3b?
[03:00] <jrib> nikitis_: did you run the command it suggested in that case?
[03:00] <Pelo> Crazytom,   gnomebaker
[03:00] <jrib> Crazytom: nautilus, gnomebaker, graveman
[03:01] <Frog29> pelo - just looking for the official
[03:01] <shine> gnomebaker for Gnome is good
[03:01] <nikitis_> jrib: yes I did, it just sits there unfortunately
[03:01] <iamelite> ok im getting this message from glxgears.  Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[03:01] <samk> i use imgburn it might only be 4 windows tough
[03:01] <Crazytom> thaks
[03:01] <bambie> i just installed ubuntu 6.06 on my laptop
[03:01] <nikitis_> jrib: I got the cd from an official ubuntu mirror
[03:01] <bambie> and my wireless network is not working for some reason?
[03:01] <samk> bambie oyu should get 7.04
[03:01] <kalikiana> disasm, I was able to install samba and tried to configure it. But I don|t have a working login name and pass.
[03:01] <bambie> lol
[03:01] <bambie> now thats funny
[03:01] <jrib> nikitis_: by "just sits there", do you mean it loads a gui program and then does nothing?  or the command just doesn't do anything?
[03:01] <ixian_> can someone tell me how to enable write in my 'My Music' folder on a fat32 partition?? i can view/play the files in the folder but i cant write to the folder, and the folder has a little lock symbol on it in the file browser ;/
[03:01] <mister_roboto> TheIronChef: eventually you get used to everything just working without being loaded with tons of useless advertising crap (all new windows pc's) and you'll come to love it :)   that is, if you get past the learning curve and can do all the work you need to do
[03:01] <disasm> kalikiana: set security=share and you don't need one
[03:01] <Ax4> bambie, yes, get 7.0.4
[03:01] <Crazytom> bambie, what chipset?  if you don't know do sudo lspci -v | grep Wireless
[03:01] <jrib> !vfat > ixian_    (ixian_, see the private message from ubotu)

[03:02] <bambie> Crazytom Air link
=== _cappiz is now known as cappiz
[03:02] <ixian_> its a fat32 partition..
[03:02] <bambie> well i was told to get 6.06 it does supports wireless
[03:02] <nikitis_> jrib: I didn't try it in terminal,  I just did the alt-f2 thing.  Let me try that really quickly
[03:02] <Ek0nomik> Is anyone else having problems installing Feisty?  I am getting a black screen after the menu loading screen...
[03:02] <bambie> now when i installed it i'm being told to get 7.0.4
[03:02] <Pelo> ixian_,  try looking for help in the forum
[03:03] <disasm> nikitis_: if by alt-f2 you mean ctrl-alt-f2 that is a terminal
[03:03] <ixian_> Pelo, so i shouldnt try the command you just gave me?
[03:03] <samk> anyone know how to get to my sd card from ubuntu?
[03:03] <jrib> ixian_: you need to mount with the proper options in your fstab, the wiki page ubotu gave you tells you the exact options you need
[03:03] <innerreflection> is there a place I can get someone to vnc into my machine and help me? I pretty frustrated with my sound at this point after 3 days of troubleshooting and I'm willing to pay for quality support
[03:03] <Ek0nomik> ixian:  it's probably just your folder permissions.
[03:03] <Pelo> bambie,   slightly better  wifi support in 7.04,   and I is just out
[03:03] <disasm> bambie: thats because feisty is the new stable ;-)
[03:03] <Ek0nomik> it's a root owned folder.
[03:03] <ixian_> jrib, the partition mounts fine, i can write to it, but for some reason not the 'my music' folder..
[03:03] <ryan_> i did sudo apt-get install irssi....anybody tell me where it's located?
[03:03] <samk> sudo
[03:03] <Pelo> bambie,  your best bet at this point it to look for a how to in the forumm
[03:03] <Ek0nomik> ixian:  you probably made the folder as root.
[03:03] <bambie> hrrm
[03:03] <samk> anyone know how to mount sd cards?
[03:03] <eck> disasm: all of the supported releases are "stable"
[03:03] <Ek0nomik> thus, it has root only privledges.
[03:03] <mister_roboto> ryan_: dpkg -L <pkgname>
[03:04] <stylus> how can i use the keyboard to maximise my terminal window?
[03:04] <disasm> ixian_: are you mounting with user in fstab?
[03:04] <ixian_> Ek0nomik, i made the folder in Windows XP
[03:04] <nikitis_> disasm: it says to hit alt-f2 to bring up a tiny gnome run window
[03:04] <ryan_> thanks man
[03:04] <jrib> stylus: alt-f10
[03:04] <bambie> does 6.06 supports wired network or not?
[03:04] <bambie> so that way i can update
[03:04] <bambie> cause i dont have 7.04 cd
[03:04] <disasm> eck: yes, but all the supported releases aren't new, I said it's the new stable, but just semantics, not important
[03:04] <stylus> jrib: thanks
[03:04] <ixian_> disasm, , this is my fstab entry : /dev/sdb1   /media/STUFF   vfat   user,fmask=0111,dmask=0000   0   0
[03:04] <magnetron> samk: use mount in a terminal or use "Disk Management"
[03:05] <Pelo> bambie,  yes it does, but not is not a great time to upgrade,  servers are very busy
[03:05] <kevinG> yo, can anyone link me a tutorial for getting nvidia drivers to work in feisty?
[03:05] <nikitis_> jrib: i get this sh: Can't open /cdrom/cdromupgrade
[03:05] <magnetron> !nvidia | kevinG
[03:05] <mister_roboto> !nvidia |kevinG
[03:05] <ubotu> kevinG: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:05] <bambie> so should i just hook up my wired thing to my laptop and its gonna work?
[03:05] <pdusen> I need help.. I installed 7.04 with the alternative CD, but Xorg doesn't want to start up. I've been trying to follow the ATI wiki guide to install the fglrx driver, but I am starting to think that ubuntu didn't install a driver for my network device, because none of the apt-get update things seem to be working
[03:05] <kevinG> the method on the ubuntu website doesn't seem to work
[03:05] <disasm> ixian_: umount /media/STUFF then do ls -hald /media/STUFF and look at the rwx---- stuff
[03:05] <TheIronChef> cani install the wine the same as the way on edgy>?
[03:05] <Pelo> !wireless > bambie   check your pm  , those instructions should help you do it in edgy
[03:05] <jrib> nikitis_: is anything in /cdrom?
[03:05] <kalikiana> disasm, Thank you, it is working. (It is for backup only)
[03:06] <nikitis_> jrib: yes I can see it poping up on the desktop, and I can access the files on the disc
[03:06] <disasm> kalikiana: no problem ;-) glad I could help
[03:06] <bambie> thanks
[03:06] <jrib> nikitis_: does this command list anything:  ls /cdrom
[03:06] <nikitis_> jrib: yes it lists all the ubuntu 7.04 cd files

[03:09] <disasm> no it's slowing down :(( was at 500, now it's down to 300 k/s
[03:09] <ixian_> disasm, , ok
[03:09] <russe11> magnetron: I don't think you're rude. :)
[03:09] <pdusen> Hey, anyone?
[03:09] <jrib> ixian_: try unmounting and then remounting so you make sure it uses the fstab options
[03:09] <yfarjoun> Pelo, I see, well...it's probaby all for the best...
[03:09] <disasm> ixian_: now mount it, you should be able to write as a user now
[03:10] <nikitis_> jrib: any ideas?
[03:10] <samk> does anyone know how to mount an sd card
[03:10] <Pelo> thornomad,   just search for it on any torrent site,  it's all the same torrent

[03:10] <GPLGeek> question: Why does it freeze at 22% (copying files) on every computer, burned slow with good quality cds. md5sum right on iso, quality check on cd turns up that its a good cd.
[03:10] <yfarjoun> the update manager should use bittorrent protocol on new releases...
[03:10] <nikitis_> jrib: there is no program called cdromupgrade on the ubuntu cd
[03:10] <thornomad> Pelo: is it ? on the edgy version i remember testing md5 with anohter guy from different mirrors and we had different torrents ... let me try this one
[03:10] <nikitis_> jrib: /cdrom is there
[03:11] <jrib> nikitis_: hmm, you are sure you have the alternate cd?
[03:11] <nikitis_> jrib: no, i have the 7.04 cd
[03:11] <steve_> i'm trying to get gmail working on evolution but does anyone know what the "leave mail on server" option means?
[03:11] <innerreflection> Desperate nub in search of sound/wine expert. Need help getting multiple wine programs to play sound at the same time. (I've tried at least 3 guides,)
[03:11] <pdusen> I need help.. I installed 7.04 with the alternative CD, but Xorg doesn't want to start up. I've been trying to follow the ATI wiki guide to install the fglrx driver, but I am starting to think that ubuntu didn't install a driver for my network device, because none of the apt-get update things seem to be working
[03:11] <steve_> "leave messages on server"
[03:11] <jrib> nikitis_: ah right, you can only use the alternate cd to upgrade
[03:11] <Pelo> thornomad,   I just make sure the tracker is torrent.ubuntu ...   and it should be the official
[03:11] <Stoffer> is there a better than default pdf reader/editor in the synaptic package manager?
[03:11] <Dekkard> it means leave the messages on the server..
[03:11] <thornomad> Pelo, okay, thanks
[03:11] <steve_> on which server?
[03:11] <jrib> Stoffer: try xpdf
[03:11] <steve_> gmails servers?
[03:12] <Dekkard> the gmail server
[03:12] <charliesu> seriously how can yall make this so difficult?
[03:12] <nikitis_> jrib: ah ok
[03:12] <steve_> ok
[03:12] <steve_> thx
[03:12] <nikitis_> jrib: can I upgrade using a mounted iso?
[03:12] <Dekkard> np
[03:12] <ixian_> disasm, it worked thanks :D
[03:12] <neozen> steve_: IMHO I think that means that when you snag messeges to your local mailbox .. you leave them on gmail's server
[03:12] <magnetron> Stoffer: there is a bunch of them, search for "pdf" in the "add/remove programs"
[03:12] <Pelo> charliesu,  what is your issue ?
[03:12] <thornomad> Pelo, i just wondered since it only shows about 38 peers ... other people were reporting much higher numbers
[03:12] <disasm> ixian_: no problem
[03:12] <samk> anyone know how to mount things?
[03:12] <pdusen> Could I please have a moment of SOMEBODY'S time?
[03:12] <neozen> Stoffer: a good reader is xpdf
[03:13] <charliesu> pdusen: i'm somebody
[03:13] <Pelo> !torrents > thornomad   check your pm window
[03:13] <mister_roboto> !patience|pdusen
[03:13] <ubotu> pdusen: The people here are volunteers, your attitude may determine how fast you are helped.  Not everyone is available all the time, likewise not every answer is available instantly. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[03:13] <nikitis_> jrib: could you be so kind as to let me know where i can get this alternate cd?
[03:13] <bart_17> good day.. i was woundering if any of you has any idea if fiesty fawn would work out of the box with my asus a6r laptop.. thanx..
[03:13] <gRaCi0s0> anyone know about a pdf editor ?
[03:13] <mister_roboto> pdusen: just ask your question periodically
[03:13] <Dekkard> doesn't evince do pdf?
[03:13] <pdusen> I need help.. I installed 7.04 with the alternative CD, but Xorg doesn't want to start up. I've been trying to follow the ATI wiki guide to install the fglrx driver, but I am starting to think that ubuntu didn't install a driver for my network device, because none of the apt-get update things seem to be working
[03:13] <charliesu> bart_17: yes..
[03:13] <wastrel> bart_17:  best way to find out is to try to run the desktop cd
[03:13] <neozen> Stoffer: for editing them.. just use abiword or open-office writer
[03:13] <jrib> nikitis_: it seems possible to me, but I have not done it
[03:13] <thornomad> thanks Pelo ... got your pm.  that is what i am using at 38 peers
[03:13] <Pelo> !mount > samk  ;check your pm window
[03:13] <Stoffer> thanks all
[03:13] <samk> How do you mount an sd card?????????:)
[03:14] <magnetron> samk: use "man mount" in terminal or use gui, like "Disk Management"
[03:14] <bart_17> thanx carliesu
[03:14] <nikitis_> jrib: it says that the alternate CD is for machines with 256 MB's or less.  Is that a crappier version of ubuntu?
[03:14] <neozen> Dekkard: yes... it does... but it irks me
[03:14] <bart_17> thanx waster
[03:14] <magnetron> saml: install it via "add/ remove programs"
[03:14] <gfather> hay guys
[03:14] <gRaCi0s0> anyone know about a pdf editor ?
[03:14] <Dekkard> smak under filesystem in nautilus does it show the sd card
[03:14] <jrib> nikitis_: no, it just doesn't have the live cd part.  It uses the text installer instead
[03:14] <Pelo> samk,  it should be the same as mounting anything else,  and I am a bit surprised that it's not mounting automaticaly, most removable media does
[03:14] <Stoffer> magnetron, in general, are ubuntu-supported apps any better than non-supported apps?
[03:14] <neozen> gRaCioso: abiword or openoffice-writer
[03:14] <mister_roboto> pdusen: i don't have "the" answer for you but i can say that if a part of a package fails to download during an install, apt-get won't pretend that it succeeded. the whole install would have failed.
[03:15] <Pelo> gRaCi0s0,  I think you can edit pdfs in OpenOffice
[03:15] <CnH> pdusen, try doing a ping to some other address, the servers seem to be jammed up pretty bad today
[03:15] <Mudoch> strange, my download is taking a nap... what is file 402??? its been siting on it for 3 minutes
[03:15] <darwin> nikitis_: no, it's for people that don't need or don't have enough capacity for the LiveCD or want to do a server install
[03:15] <neozen> nikitis_: no... same version... just doesn't require as much ram to install
[03:15] <gRaCi0s0> Pelo,  y tryied and i cant
[03:15] <mister_roboto> pdusen: it might help to pastebin your Xorg.0.log file and then put the link in with your question
[03:15] <Pelo> Mudoch,   servers are a bit overloaded atm  ,  with all the ppl  upgrading , be patient
[03:15] <magnetron> Stoffer: it is more a question about support status than quality, imo
[03:15] <Tell> can someone please help me with installing my graphics drivers?
[03:16] <gRaCi0s0> Pelo,  well i can see my pdf files but i cant modify them
[03:16] <magnetron> !nvidia | Tell
[03:16] <ubotu> Tell: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[03:16] <Stoffer> magnetron, ic, ok
[03:16] <Pelo> Tell,  we need more info
[03:16] <Dekkard> peeps.. the servers are freekin slammed.. if your ld is lsow try later
[03:16] <wastrel> Mudoch:  everyone's package list will be different, depending on the pacakages on their system when they upgrade
[03:16] <jijutm> ok guys.. se you all later
[03:16] <Adam1213_> the desktop live cd version lack a lot of stuff, is there a dvd version?
[03:16] <Tell> Ive tried them, no joy. Im following the instructions but theyre not matching what Im seeing on ubuntu

[03:16] <Tell> #
[03:16] <Tell> In the Software Preferences dialog that comes up, click the Add button.
[03:16] <bart_17> charliesu: i don't have to tweek anything to get the built in wifi to work?
[03:16] <BHSPitMonkey> ok, so I have a box here... it has no video output.  I'd like to be able to install *ubuntu and immediately ssh into it, is this easily doable?
[03:16] <gfather> im trying to install (nftytool) its for a card programe (infinty usb )
[03:16] <Tell> I dont have that option
[03:16] <pdusen> CnH: Well, what I'm talking about is when I enter "apt-get update", every connection seems to fail instantly. Is there something wrong with my network driver and can I do anything to fix it?
[03:16] <Pelo> gRaCi0s0,  some ppl use pdf but they are actualy a bunch images , those can't be  edited as txt
[03:16] <Ax4> are there any fast .edu servers remaining?
[03:16] <Mudoch> pelo, thanks.... figures.... the download just stopped updating the speed too, thought I hit a pot hole.... 8)

[03:16] <jrib> Tell: please do not paste here, check the different tabs
[03:16] <darwin> Does Ktorrent cycle through trackers like utorrent does?
[03:16] <wastrel> Ax4:  torrent
[03:16] <mister_roboto> BHSPitMonkey: you will have to also install "openssh-server" package after the initial install
[03:16] <tbuss> Would there be any harm in following the install instructions for a LAMP that are based on dapper if I use edgy?
[03:17] <CnH> possibly, try doing a ping to google or something
[03:17] <thornomad> Pelo: thanks for your help the number of peers is growing ... my the torrent program only picks them up a little at a time or something. i don't really usnerd stand how it works.  smile. thanks again.  see ya
[03:17] <mister_roboto> BHSPitMonkey: then you can
[03:17] <sivel27> hello all
[03:17] <Ax4> im on a .edu

[03:17] <gfather> im trying to install (nftytool) its for a card programe (infinty usb )  any help pleas
[03:17] <Ax4> .edu <-> .edu is supposed to kick arse :D
[03:17] <BHSPitMonkey> mister_roboto, that's not too good.
[03:17] <Pelo> Ax4,  use torrents
[03:17] <Taxman> pdusen: what does ipax4 torrent, please
[03:17] <mister_roboto> BHSPitMonkey: i'm just the messenger, dude :)
[03:17] <yzf600> hello
[03:17] <magnetron> BHSPitMonkey: you can control the alternate install via SSH
[03:17] <Stoffer> Dekkard, does that have anything to do with the synaptic package manager downloads being really slow?  The overloaded servers you just mentioned, that is...
=== ericho_ is now known as ericho
[03:17] <BHSPitMonkey> mister_roboto, I know there are other livecd's that do similar things for similar purposes
[03:17] <nick_> someone plz help me upgrade to feisty
[03:17] <darwin> Does Ktorrent cycle through trackers like utorrent does?
[03:17] <BHSPitMonkey> magnetron, that might be a winner.
[03:18] <jrib> !upgrade > nick_    (nick_, see the private message from ubotu)
[03:18] <Dekkard> Stoffer:  yep
[03:18] <Pelo> nick58b,  you donT' want to upgrade just now, wait a few days
[03:18] <Dekkard> i downloaded scribus and the best I could get was 29kb
[03:18] <nick_> !upgrade
[03:18] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[03:18] <Pelo> nick_, you donT' want to upgrade jsut now wait a few days
[03:18] <pdusen> How does pinging work in linux (Yeah, I know, I know, just tell me.)
[03:18] <NickGarvey> Pelo: who says he doesn't want to upgrade now?
[03:18] <gRaCi0s0> Pelo,  so cant i modify the pdf files?
[03:18] <NickGarvey> pdusen: "ping server"
[03:18] <Ax4> where can i get a 7.04 i386 .torrent?
[03:18] <Ax4> link?
[03:18] <NickGarvey> pdusen: man ping for more info
[03:18] <Adam1213_> is there a dvd of ubuntu ?
[03:18] <pdusen> ok
[03:18] <NickGarvey> Ax4: second, I'll get you one
[03:18] <pdusen> I shall be back
[03:18] <magnetron> !torrents | Ax4
[03:18] <ubotu> Ax4: Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[03:19] <Ax4> :D
[03:19] <Ax4> thx
[03:19] <NickGarvey> magnetron: your way is better
[03:19] <Taxman> Adam1213_: yes, though for feisty, I don't know if it's out yet
[03:19] <Pelo> gRaCi0s0,   I don'T know,  I was under the impression that you couldn'T modify pdfs anyway ,  try just coping the content to a word processor or something
[03:19] <magnetron> NickGarvey: :D
[03:19] <tbuss> I have an apache problem, I set up a username and password for my site, but it can be "sidestepped" if I click cancel three times in the dialog box?
[03:19] <mister_roboto> BHSPitMonkey: there might be a way that i don't know of . all i know is that all the ways i tried installing (off of live cd, alternative cd, text based, server, etc), i always had to get openssh-server separately
[03:19] <nick_> Pelo: do you know why it isn't telling me ther is an update i have auto update on, and when i try to get it manually i see no updates
[03:19] <petafile> ns id salsa
[03:19] <Mudoch> Mannetron thanks for the info/help... I'll just use an static IP for now.....
[03:19] <BHSPitMonkey> magnetron, I'm usually not as bad about data-hunting, but do you know where I can read up on that feature
[03:19] <NickGarvey> tbuss: um.. that sounds unlikely..  could you explain more?
[03:20] <Ax4> uh oh! wget is working now!
[03:20] <deepsa> is kvm and xen both available for ubuntu-desktop?
[03:20] <clop> is there a partition size limit for ext3?
[03:20] <tbuss> NIckGarvey: sure....
[03:20] <magnetron> BHSPitMonkey: wait...
[03:20] <charliesu> <-- drunk!      Anyone know what apt-torrent project is going to be worked on?
[03:20] <petafile> Question:  Is there a guide to how to get Beryl working with XGL/fglrx in Feisty w/ a radeon card that someone could point me to?
[03:20] <Pelo> nick_,  wich version of ubuntu are you using ?  the upgrade thing only shows if you are using edgy
[03:20] <zilly6> has anyone ever had any luck getting a refund on the windows that came bundled with their computer from dell/hp/gateway?
[03:20] <neozen> Dekkard: pigs will fly first
[03:20] <NickGarvey> !beryl | petafile
[03:20] <ubotu> petafile: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[03:20] <Pelo> clop,  no there isnT'
[03:20] <Ax4> if you guys want a great new torrent client, consider Deluge
[03:20] <Ax4> :D
[03:20] <BHSPitMonkey> zilly6, you just have to demand.
[03:20] <nick_> Pelo: i am on edgy

[03:21] <BHSPitMonkey> zilly6, you can't agree to the eula when you start it, though.
[03:21] <nick_> Tell: get a program called envy
[03:21] <Pelo> nick_,  I don'T know why you don'T have it , sorry
[03:21] <Tell> followed them, instructions dont match my screen
[03:21] <sivel27> so is feisty stavle enough, then?
[03:21] <Ax4> Pelo, that's what i've been doing, deluge runs natively tho
[03:21] <sivel27> stable
[03:21] <NickGarvey> musya: have pity on the servers
[03:21] <neozen> Dekkard: I don't think anything short of a MASSIVE fibre-fragging could bring down google
[03:21] <zilly6> yeah, i'm looking at the eula screen right now
[03:21] <BHSPitMonkey> sivel27, feisty is as stavle as it'll ever get.
[03:21] <sivel27> heh
[03:21] <musya> and my update manager is up to date
[03:21] <NickGarvey> BHSPitMonkey: naw.. always updates
[03:21] <musya> you think its the servers?
[03:21] <Dekkard> neozen:  hehe
[03:22] <HasratUSA> i have just started the upgrade but the distribution upgrade tool just keeps sitting at 'fetching file 1 of 1241'
[03:22] <Pelo> Ax4,   deluge is nice but not quite up to par yet,  I'm a  big user of the RSS dler in utorrent so that's why I haven'T switched
[03:22] <deepsa> mister_roboto: can you please tell me of any guide on howto work out kvm in fiesty?
[03:22] <Dekkard> jsut wondering why people don't google for configs
[03:22] <BHSPitMonkey> zilly6, http://www.windowsrefund.info/
[03:22] <IndyGunFreak> HasratUSA: thats probably because the server is overwhelmed
[03:22] <NickGarvey> musya: it would make sense
[03:22] <Tell> what'll envy do?
[03:22] <NickGarvey> !envy | tell
[03:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about envy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:22] <musya> hmm, ok
[03:22] <mister_roboto> deepsa: sorry, no idea. never used it
[03:22] <NickGarvey> or.. not
[03:22] <Pelo> HasratUSA,   servers are very busy, lots of ppl upgrading
[03:22] <musya> thanks
[03:22] <NickGarvey> Tell: read the page.. it says
[03:22] <steve_> this is going to sound retarded but I just downloaded a program called gmenu-editor and I don't know how to install it
[03:22] <deepsa> !kvm
[03:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about kvm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:22] <steve_> do i type ./configure or something
[03:22] <Ax4> Pelo, im sure as demand and usage of deluge increases, it's feature set will improve
[03:22] <delire> HasratUSA: servers are hit really hard. an unprecedented number of people upgrading. as always, Ubuntu is used by many more people than anticipated at any given time.
[03:22] <mister_roboto> deepsa: generally, google is a good friend in such times :)
[03:22] <deepsa> !virtualization
[03:22] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about virtualization - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:22] <IndyGunFreak> its taken me about 40min to download java...lol
[03:22] <zilly6> thanks BHSPitMonkey
[03:22] <jrib> steve_: why?  just right click on the ubuntu icon and go to "Edit menus"
[03:22] <mister_roboto> !kvm
[03:22] <deepsa> mister_roboto: okay :)
[03:22] <musya> anybody think the conference in Portland is of any good?

[03:23] <steve_> oh!
[03:23] <steve_> nice :)
[03:23] <[koji] > is the distribution upgrade able to resume operation?
=== wpunte_ is now known as wpunte
[03:23] <Pelo> Ax4,  I agree and it it gets RSS dler before utorrent goes linux I probably will switch
[03:23] <delire> [koji] : yes
[03:23] <Mudoch> does anyone know of a good FTP server I can run on fiesty?
[03:23] <steve_> i didn't know you could do that jrib
[03:23] <yzf600> An hour ago, I started the upgrade to fiesty via update manager "upgrade now" button. It's about 15% of the way throug file downloads. Can I kill it and upgrade later next week when the servers aren't slammed?
[03:23] <musya> Mudoch: proftpd
[03:23] <TheIronChef> wow WINE is amazing.
[03:23] <jrib> steve_: ah ok
[03:23] <[koji] > delire: so i just need to rerun it again then
[03:23] <HasratUSA> okay i believe it's got so popular that the servers are just fukt and so am i :)
[03:23] <wastrel> yzf600:  should be safe to do that yes
[03:23] <Ax4> Mudoch, vsftpd
[03:23] <delire> [koji] : yep
[03:23] <HasratUSA> yzf600: that's the same question i wanna ask
[03:23] <delire> yzf600: just run it again later no problem.
[03:24] <ferguscan> Anyone know why I can see my mobile phone using "hcitool inq", but can't see it using gnome-obex-send or gnome-phone-manager or anything else?
[03:24] <Josesordo> how to update to feisty??
[03:24] <Tell> Looking for envy, getting no joy..
[03:24] <NickGarvey> tbuss: honestly, I'm not much of a web guy, perhaps #apache would help?
[03:24] <jrib> Josesordo: Your question is answered in the FAQ which is linked in the channel's topic.  You can view the channel's topic at any time by typing:    /topic
[03:24] <HasratUSA> and how can i kill it? what's the safest way to kill the 'distribution upgrade' program?
[03:24] <BHSPitMonkey> magnetron, mmk.
[03:24] <Pelo> ysf600 if you didnT' start changing files and it's just downloading I would assume you can,  you'll probably get a confirmation message when you do anway that will tell you if it is wrong
[03:24] <ferguscan> When I hit refresh on the devices list in those apps, it just sits there for ages, seemingly doing nothing.
[03:24] <NickGarvey> jrib: got that on copy eh?
[03:24] <Tell> So er,am I to take it I wont have any graphics card drivers?
[03:24] <bimberi> yzf600: yes, it will just resume downloading from where it left off
[03:24] <jrib> NickGarvey: well alias at least
[03:24] <Tell> when I right click, theres no mark for installation button
[03:24] <NickGarvey> jrib: :)
[03:24] <Tell> in repositories, no add button
[03:25] <Tell> so Im stuck in limbo.
[03:25] <magnetron> BHSPitMonkey: i can't remember where i read about it, sorry
[03:25] <ferguscan> Also, does anyone know if the nvidia drivers are fixed in Feisty?
[03:25] <BHSPitMonkey> k
[03:25] <jrib> Tell: join me in #ubuntu-classroom
[03:25] <BHSPitMonkey> thanks anyway
[03:25] <HasratUSA> Pelo so far i have reached up to 'preparing the upgrade' and 'modifying software channels' (those two, i mean the first two are checked and the rest are not'
[03:25] <Mudoch> Ax4, musya... any opinion on filezilla or is that only for Windows
[03:25] <tbuss> NickGarvery: no offense to those out there that are very skilled in linux, but those guys in #apache don't seem to like noobies :)
[03:25] <NickGarvey> ferguscan: "fixed"?
[03:25] <ferguscan> NickGarvey, a week or two ago, they were borked.
[03:25] <Ax4> Mudoch, i believe it's windows.... and i thought it was just a client
[03:25] <innerreflection> Desperate nub in search of sound/wine expert. Need help getting multiple wine programs to play sound at the same time. (I've tried at least 3 guides,)
[03:25] <bofh80> hi people, i know your busy in here, i've been through my system log etc, i was wondering if there's such thing as an application log for this? a log that keeps track off what has been run when?
[03:25] <tbuss> NickGarvery: I appreciate your help however
[03:25] <Pelo> delire,  thanks for the heads up ,  that will be very usefull info for those who ask
[03:25] <Ax4> Mudoch, don't quote me on that though
[03:25] <TheIronChef> how od you join another room?
[03:25] <HasratUSA> Pelo is it safe for me to kill the upgrade?
[03:25] <NickGarvey> tbuss: eh, well if you do some research before hand and can't find anything I can't imagine they would "jfgi" you..
[03:25] <magnetron> BHSPitMonkey: the installer is called "debian-installer", check up on that
[03:26] <NickGarvey> tbuss: never know though..
[03:26] <samk> anyone know how mount sd card?
[03:26] <LabThug_hm> "Servers may be slow please be patient"  <-- Ain't that the truth
[03:26] <fami> how handle .rar file with ubuntu?
[03:26] <Pelo> HasratUSA,   are you in the middle of a download ? then yes
[03:26] <fami> !.rar
[03:26] <NickGarvey> !rar | fami
[03:26] <ubotu> rar is a non-free archive format created by Rarsoft. For instructions on accessing .rar files through the Archive Manager view https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression. There is a free (as in speech) unrar utility as well, see !info unrar-free
[03:26] <ubotu> fami: please see above
[03:26] <delire> HasratUSA: yes it is, though only if it's downloading. best not to interrupt the point where packages are being _installed_
[03:26] <TheIronChef> #ubuntu-classroom
[03:26] <TheIronChef> how do i join that :(
[03:26] <HasratUSA> delire nothing is downloading. it just says 'fetching file 1 of 1241'
[03:26] <clop> hi, im trying to install ubuntu feisty, and i got through the installer, but when the computer reboots without the CD it goes black and all i see is a blinking cursor
[03:26] <Mudoch> ax4 I promise I wont... I'm new at Linux and Ubuntu.....   Used HPU/x bout 11 years ago.... haven't touched it since... so I'm on a learning curve
[03:26] <LabThug_hm> TheIronChef: type '/join #ubuntu-classroom'
[03:26] <fami> NickGarvey: thanks
[03:26] <Dekkard> TheIronChef:  /join
[03:26] <delire> HasratUSA: you can interrupt that just fine.
[03:26] <Pelo> TheIronChef,  right click on the link you just tiped
[03:27] <tbuss> NickGarvery: they wanted my url so they could replicate, but I was tryin gto expalin that it was private for now until I straitened out the perms issue. understandable though
[03:27] <NickGarvey> clop: "blinking cursor?"
[03:27] <Flannel> tbuss: the guys in #apache are pretty friendly, they should be able to answer that.
[03:27] <Ax4> Mudoch, fasten ur seat belt then lol
[03:27] <yzf600> I found a python process running with /tmp/XXXXX/fiesty  in the name.
[03:27] <clop> like an underline
[03:27] <TheIronChef> ah thank you ... im obviously a n00b
[03:27] <clop> but there is literally no text
[03:27] <LabThug_hm> no ' of course :)
[03:27] <clop> like nothing that says grub or anything
[03:27] <pdusen> How do I tell me network adapter to acquire an IP address with DHCP?
[03:27] <bayziders> Wow the upgrade speeds just get worse and worse
[03:27] <wastrel> tbuss:  you're using .htpasswd?
[03:27] <NickGarvey> pdusen: leave the defaults
[03:27] <tristil> clop, what kind of computer?
[03:27] <yzf600> I did a "sudo kill 6456" on it and the upgrade manager disappeared
[03:27] <clop> it goes right from the bios messages to a black screen with the blinking underline
[03:27] <darwin> When I turn on Desktop effects there is only one workspace.
[03:27] <clop> it's a dell, pentium-d system
[03:27] <HasratUSA> okay hell with the upgrade im sticking to edgy :)
[03:27] <Ax4> bayziders, at least you have some speed, im still trying to get apt to connect to a mirror lol
[03:27] <Pelo> bayziders,  yes, each time you mention it we throttle you down
[03:27] <Pelo> :-)
[03:28] <clop> i tried installing the amd64 version
[03:28] <yzf600> I re-ran update manager, and it still offers me the update button
[03:28] <pdusen> NickGarvey: When I try to ping google it fails, so I am assuming my network adapter isn't configured properly.
[03:28] <tristil> clop, why?
[03:28] <darwin> When I turn on Desktop effects there is only one workspace.
[03:28] <bayziders> Lol, Ax4 mine has been running for about 4 hours, that's why I got some speed I guess.
[03:28] <Mudoch> ax4, yeah it's tightened up real good, I'm speaking in saprano right now....  Now if I can get VB running in Ubuntu.... ooooohhhhh my Apple loving boss would just die...
[03:28] <witless> is it possible to cancel the feisty over-network upgrade?  i'm getting a torrent much faster...
[03:28] <NickGarvey> pdusen: can you ping your router?
[03:28] <ShiFTKey> who here is running 7.04?
[03:28] <Ax4> you can't ping google....
[03:28] <yzf600> I'll try again after the demand has died won

[03:28] <yzf600> thanks for your help, everyone
[03:28] <musya> Mudoch: i believe its only for windows, but gftp is good for linux
[03:28] <HasratUSA> it just started to download something!!!
[03:28] <Pelo> darwin,  you can add the workspace switcher to the pannel by riglciking on the pannel and add to the pannel
[03:28] <disasm> Ax4: I won't hog it ;-)

[03:29] <witless> is it possible to cancel the feisty over-network upgrade?  i'm getting a torrent much faster...  <--  anyone?
[03:29] <tristil> clop, you looked at this? http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-185537.html
[03:29] <ShiFTKey> does anyone know if there doing shipit with this version?
[03:30] <IndyGunFreak> ShiFTKey: lol, np.
[03:30] <Ax4> ubunt.com only giving me 300ish
[03:30] <NickGarvey> pdusen: ifconfig, it will be the default gateway
[03:30] <oth> Pelo, why's that ?
[03:30] <oblib> I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[03:30] <wastrel> tbuss:  are you sure you're not seeing a cached version of the page after the 3rd password attempt?
[03:30] <magnetron> darwin: this is a known bug. the fix is: 1. hit alt+f2  2. enter gconf-editor  3. change /apps/compiz/general/screen0/options hsize to 4
[03:30] <tbuss> wastrel: I checked with HEAD and any even reloaded ff
[03:30] <arejay> anyone know how to change the time-out of sudo?
[03:30] <delire> oth: the demand is insanely high right now..
[03:30] <Pelo> oth,  servers are overwhelmed what all the ppl who clicked the upgrade button
[03:30] <clop> tristil, i understand that it's going to be buggier than 32-bit, but an application i need for my work literally does not run on 32-bit intel
[03:31] <TheDebugger> ShiFTKey: Yes, already ordered mine :)
[03:31] <witless> is it possible to CANCEL the upgrade?
[03:31] <NickGarvey> arejay: visudo
[03:31] <oth> hmm
[03:31] <arejay> NickGarvey, thank's :)
[03:31] <tristil> clop, I wasn't telling you not to do, that's just what I got through Google. :)
[03:31] <tbuss> wastrel: the funny thing is, the page will load after third attempt but loses all style sheet support that would otherwise be there
[03:31] <oth> what upgrade button sudo update-manager -c ? :p
[03:31] <innerreflection> Desperate nub in search of sound/wine expert. Need help getting multiple wine programs to play sound at the same time. (I've tried at least 3 guides,)
[03:31] <LabThug_hm> Pelo: is there any mirrors we can configure our "upgrade buttons" to use?
[03:31] <Pelo> witless,  yes if you are only at the downloading stage
[03:31] <pdusen> NickGarvey: I'll return in a moment after I've tried that
[03:31] <Pelo> oth,  same thing,  servers are too busy,  wait a few days
[03:31] <W|cked> awesome
[03:31] <oth> alright, I'll wait then
[03:31] <Pelo> LabThug_hm,   wait a few days
[03:31] <delire> arejay: you can set this in your sudoers file
[03:31] <ShiFTKey> TheDebugger: thanks, I can download them, but it looks alot nicer to hand out the ship cds rather then my permenent marker ones
[03:32] <downfallat111> is the widescreen resolution prblem fixed in feisty, or will I have to use the 915resolution program?
[03:32] <HasratUSA> witless it would be great for yourself if you don't cause although it's extremely slow right now, you will be downloading some files at an extremely slow rate. on the other hand, the more people gets frustrated, impatient and kills the upgrade, the more speed i get :)
[03:32] <delire> witless: yes, as long as you are cancelling it during the download process.
[03:32] <LabThug_hm> Pelo: "Don't care how, I want it now!!!!"
[03:32] <statictonic> widescreen worked fine out of the box for me in feisty
[03:32] <LabThug_hm> ever see the original Willy Wonka?
[03:32] <Pelo> LabThug_hm,  , oth  if you guys can't way get the torrent,   alternate install cd for upgrade live cd for a clean install
[03:32] <Ax4> disasm, you wouldn't happen to have the full address path, so i can start downloading? :p
[03:32] <tristil> clop, does it use EFI maybe?
[03:32] <witless> it's downloading now, but i'm downloading a torrent much faster
[03:32] <bayziders> So how do you all like feisty? =)
[03:32] <clop> tristil, EFI?
[03:32] <magnetron> innerreflection: you are using OSS, and OSS only supports one program at a time as default. is it Wow and Ventrilo? =D
[03:32] <oblib> LVM Experts: I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[03:32] <tristil> clop, anything unusual about the BIOS?
[03:33] <downfallat111> does feisty support webcam
[03:33] <disasm> Ax4: deb http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/ubuntu/ feisty main restricted
[03:33] <oth> I can wait
[03:33] <Pelo> LabThug_hm,  the original willy wonka gave me the creeps, those umpalumpas are freaksh
[03:33] <smo> antone know if a variable for the created user in ubiquity install process is created ??? or howto know that...
[03:33] <clop> not really, it's just a generic dell one
[03:33] <Ax4> disasm, cool :)
[03:33] <HasratUSA> delire oh really?
[03:33] <n3rdism> I'm using a onboard intel chip for video, ubuntu has installed the default drivers perfectly. However I'm running the machine off my tv screen and require a smaller resolution then 1024x768. Everytime I change my resolution, using Edgy Eft, and make default; even when I don't make default, It will freeze up and take me back to login screen not saving the resolution settings.
[03:33] <LabThug_hm> hahahaha
[03:33] <soulrider_> does anyone know whent he next LTS release is comming ?
[03:33] <witless> i'm downloading the alternate install ISO
[03:33] <innerreflection> magnetron: yep, how's you guess? umm, yea, I've read about OSS and Alsa, but none of the guides seem to work for me
[03:33] <clop> it looks exactly like this guy's problem:
[03:33] <clop> https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/5061
[03:33] <NickGarvey> soulrider_: I'd assume.. at least after the old one runs out.. so don't get too anxious
[03:33] <MrMakeveli> i woudl like to resize my disk partitions in order to do the feisty upgrade. i cant find the app anywhere except when i install. where is it normally?
[03:33] <ShiFTKey> I ordered a solaris cd and it never came..
[03:33] <delire> HasratUSA: yes, though only for the distribution upgrade itself.
[03:33] <ShiFTKey> i hate sun
[03:34] <neozen> well... dapper is good until 6/2009
[03:34] <ShiFTKey> ubuntu shipit > sun
[03:34] <neozen> soulrider_: so my guess is then
[03:34] <PresuntoRJ> hey, on Feisty my VLC player keeps freezing and crashing the gdm back to the login screen... any ideas?
[03:34] <magnetron> innerreflection: the wowwiki has a wine entry that adresses the problem, check that out?
[03:34] <delire> PresuntoRJ: yikes, that's no good. does it happen also with Totem?
[03:34] <oblib> MrMakeveli, do you mean GParted? Try typing 'sudo gparted' from the command line
[03:35] <Pelo> MrMakeveli,   gparted is not installed as default , but it is part of the live cd ,    if you want to resize a partition you are using now better do it from the live cd
[03:35] <Ax4> im gonna throw my 2 x 100mbit boxes on the torrent to help out :)
[03:35] <PresuntoRJ> delire: toten seems ok, but I do prefer VLC
[03:35] <rukuartic> Ax4: :O
[03:35] <MrMakeveli> oblib, pelo: i can just install it cant i?
[03:35] <innerreflection> magnetron: yes, I've tried using alsa-oss but my mic doesn't work and the sound still can't be heard in both. dunno what I'm doing wrong
[03:35] <Pelo> MrMakeveli,  sudo apt-get install  gparted
[03:35] <oblib> MrMakeveli, yeah, but it makes more sense to just do it off the install cd
[03:35] <delire> PresuntoRJ: i understand.. perhaps it's a problem with the VLC package on Feisty? where did you aquire it from?
[03:36] <PresuntoRJ> delire: what is even odder, apport wont even notice the crash.
[03:36] <pdusen> NickGarvey: I tried to ping my router and it told me the network was unreachable.
[03:36] <disasm> Ax4: did you just slow me down?
[03:36] <Pelo> MrMakeveli,   get ready for a long install, the servers are loaded right now
[03:36] <[acid] Neatchee> I know the repos are slow, but are some of them down right now?  I can't seem to get cpufrequtils to download :O
[03:36] <a514> Desktop Effects Cube worked for a sec but not now?
[03:36] <Mudoch> good nite all, thanks for the help and answers
[03:36] <Ax4> disasm, no lol
[03:36] <fulat2k> hi folks, i've been using feisty beta.  but i'm not getting any Upgrade button in both update manager and adept (using kubuntu).  I'm pointing my sources to Taiwan.  COuld that be the problem?
[03:36] <NickGarvey> pdusen: could you pastebin "ifconfig" please?
[03:36] <arejay> delire, timestamp_timeout seems to be the way do i set this under Defaults?
[03:36] <magnetron> innerreflection: Ventrilo has an issue with loosing focus, appdb.winehq.org has some writeup about it
[03:36] <PresuntoRJ> delire: add/remove (the same from aptitude or apt-get)
[03:36] <rukuartic> fulat2k: Possibly, have you tried it without?
[03:36] <[acid] Neatchee> !final | fulat2k
[03:36] <ubotu> fulat2k: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[03:36] <delire> arejay: yes, from memory that sounds right
[03:36] <Ax4> disasm, i swear, im still getting the release from the mirror i was using b4
[03:36] <pdusen> NicKGarvey: From windows?
[03:36] <disasm> Ax4: just giving you a hard time, it dropped down to 100k for a bit, it's almost done though
[03:37] <Oatmeat> how do I find out my IP in linux?
[03:37] <MrMakeveli> oblib, the problem is that i need to partition it and move my files onto the new parition im creating before i install. if i do it from the live cd i can only add delete or modify them. not move shit around right?
[03:37] <delire> PresuntoRJ: right, ok. which architecture?
[03:37] <Ax4> ifconfig -a
[03:37] <disasm> Ax4: back up to 700 k ;-)
[03:37] <delire> Oatmeat: /sbin/ifconfig
[03:37] <aoliax> hello all, my update to 7.04 just stopped around 811/1115 fetching files, is the server overloaded with requests or something, i should i try another method?
[03:37] <Oatmeat> thanks
[03:37] <rukuartic> Oatmeat: From a terminal, type "ifconfig -a"
[03:37] <eternaljoy> does the Ubuntu 7.04 LiveCD support installing Ubuntu to a 2nd hardrive?  It wont automatically install Grub on my 1st partitoon will it?
[03:37] <fulat2k> [acid] Neatchee: in that case i'm on the final then. thanks :P
[03:37] <PresuntoRJ> delire: it got to be related to a later upgrade on the beta, cause it used to work on early betas... not sure exactaly what the version I had a couple of weeks ago
[03:37] <Ax4> don't you love EASY questions?
[03:37] <Ax4> lol
[03:37] <rukuartic> aoliax: Probably overloaded, or it hit a big package :)
[03:37] <NickGarvey> pdusen: yeah, like run ifconfig and put it on a usb drive or something if you can
[03:37] <PresuntoRJ> delire: i386 (Compaq Armada M700 laptop)
[03:37] <LabThug_hm> hmmm, after the update tool is downloaded, what's supposed to happen next?  The download window disappeared, but nothing is happening.
[03:37] <[acid] Neatchee> fulat2k: I literally just asked that question when I came in here, so glad to pass on the info :)
[03:37] <rukuartic> aoliax: Do you see your router lights blinking?
[03:37] <Pie-rat2> bootsplash is supposed to look like http://jon.pmtech.com/~jschall/bootsplash.gif. instead, with vga=795 it looks like http://jon.pmtech.com/~jschall/bootsplash2.gif and with vga=792 it looks like http://jon.pmtech.com/~jschall/bootsplash3.gif
[03:37] <Pie-rat2> with no vga= option it looks like a box that says OUT OF RANGE in the middle.
[03:37] <Pie-rat2> how can i fix this?
[03:37] <oblib> MrMakeveli, but if you install on the new partition won't it overwrite the files you just copied to it? Or do you want to make a new one, copy old files to that, and then install on your old partition?
[03:38] <fami> !.chm > fami
[03:38] <delire> PresuntoRJ: sounds like a bug in VLC to me, perhaps a memory leak or similar. if i were you i'd register a bug.
[03:38] <HasratUSA> okay here is a question: has anyone successfully upgraded from Edgy to Feisty via online? is there any success rate?
[03:38] <aoliax> rukuartic, yes
=== Hacker is now known as ParTay
[03:38] <fami> !chm > fami
[03:38] <aoliax> rukuartic, light are blinking
[03:38] <eternaljoy> HasratUSA: no
[03:38] <a514> Help, the Desktop Effect Cube is not working for me?!
[03:38] <oblib> LVM Experts: I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[03:38] <rukuartic> aoliax: Then you're still downloading. :)
[03:38] <fami> ah
[03:38] <rukuartic> aoliax: Its just a big package.
[03:38] <pdusen> NickGarvey: Can't I just C&P the results of ipconfig in here?
[03:38] <PresuntoRJ> delire: if only apport set the response according to the issue, it would be realy helpful
=== ParTay is now known as Par_Tay
[03:38] <delire> Pie-rat2: from memory you have a range from 1-9 with the vga option.
[03:38] <innerreflection> magnetron: losing focus would cause my mic not to work?
[03:38] <fami> what need to read .chm file?
[03:38] <aoliax> rukuartic, this fetching seems to be taking an insaely long time, should i have waited until tomorrow to update?
[03:38] <NickGarvey> pdusen: no I want to see data from the linux box.. if you can..
[03:39] <fulat2k> [acid] Neatchee: cool :)  d/lding final release now.  gonna install on my desktop when i get back... yum, yum :)
[03:39] <jrib> fami: xchm or gnochm
[03:39] <PresuntoRJ> delire: what kind of attachements would you recomend? lspci -vv? /var/daemon.log? dmesg?
[03:39] <rukuartic> aoliax: Can you leave your computer on overnight?
[03:39] <sthompson> Hi all, can someone point me to some good documentation or first hand knowledge on how to become a mirror for Ubuntu?
[03:39] <delire> PresuntoRJ: yes, this is very odd.. it seems the crash is happening before hand, sudden-death style
[03:39] <aoliax> rukuartic, good suggestion, i guess i shall do that
[03:39] <Pie-rat2> delire: no, look it up on the internet. 792 is 1024x768 at 24 bit color, 795 is 1280x1024 at 24 bit color
[03:39] <magnetron> innerreflection: yeah, it makes the PTT key not working, read more at appdb.winehq.org
[03:39] <[acid] Neatchee> fulat2k: now I just wish the repos would speed up so I can install some extras :O
[03:39] <delire> PresuntoRJ: dmesg and ~/.xsession-errors and also a gdm log file if found.
[03:39] <Pelo> sthompson,   check the how to participate section on www.ubuntu.com,  might be how to contribute
[03:39] <HasratUSA> eternal okay so i take it noone has finished the upgrade via online yet. the lucky ones have either burnt it and did the 'distribution upgrade only' or simply reinstalled from scratch
[03:39] <PresuntoRJ> delire: as soon as I press PLAY with any video format (Ubuntu codecs) WMV, AVI, MPG...
[03:39] <MrMakeveli> oblib, this is what im doing: i already have seperate partitions for /boot, /home, /var, /swap and /.  i also want to format them all again just to start fresh fresh. my /home is 120 gib but im using like 10 of it. so i want to resize my /home to make room for a new partition where i will store the files i want to keep, and format all the others. and then install again put the files back and resize the /home back to normal. make sense?
[03:39] <magnetron> innerreflection: actually appdb is the best place for wine info
[03:39] <delire> PresuntoRJ: also detail the file you're attempting to play and your architecture.
[03:40] <fulat2k> [acid] Neatchee: what kinda extras?
[03:40] <pdusen> NickGarvey: Not unless I write it down or something, I'm literally dual-booting here. And I'm trying to do this all command line because my video drivers aren't working at the moment, so I'm not sure how I would manage to get it onto a USB drive.
[03:40] <delire> PresuntoRJ: sounds like a serious enough problem to warrant a very useful bug report..
[03:40] <tristil> clop, wait is it a clean install?
[03:40] <PresuntoRJ> delire: I'll look into it asap and post yet another issue on lauchpad ;)

[03:40] <[acid] Neatchee> specficially
[03:40] <clop> tristil, yes
[03:40] <[acid] Neatchee> specifically*
[03:40] <fami> jrib: E: Couldn't find package gnochm
[03:40] <delire> PresuntoRJ: good for you. this is how Ubuntu improves.
[03:40] <jrib> sthompson: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/mirror
[03:40] <deepsa> anyone tried kvm + qemu in the new feisty?
[03:40] <jrib> !info gnochm | fami
[03:40] <innerreflection> magnetron: I don't use PTT. also, it doesn't work even when there is nothing else running (and not able to lose focus?)
[03:40] <tristil> clop, not writing over an old grub partition?
[03:40] <ubotu> fami: gnochm: CHM file viewer for GNOME. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.9.9-0ubuntu1 (feisty), package size 143 kB, installed size 760 kB
[03:40] <bofh80> Are there any logs on my system that will say: "02:39 bofh80 /usr/bin/xchat" ?
[03:40] <jrib> fami: have you enabled universe?
[03:41] <clop> tristil, i'm not sure where it put grub

[03:41] <Pelo> [acid] Neatchee,  if you want to install new packages right at this moment,  you have to be patient
[03:41] <bambie> lol
[03:41] <PresuntoRJ> delire: and feisty is impressively better than the ones before... imagine where it could go
[03:41] <deepsa> !info qemu

[03:41] <bambie> how come i'm unable to type my user name?
[03:41] <clop> tristil, i'm trying to boot into the live cd now
[03:41] <clop> it did a weird thing where it thinks my first hard drive is /dev/sda
[03:41] <fami> jrib: enabling universe/multi... but failed at reload
[03:41] <[acid] Neatchee> Pelo: Yeah, I know :)  Can't help but hope that it speeds up soon though :P
[03:41] <HasratUSA> PresuntoRJ: have you got the latest drivers for your video card yet?
[03:41] <jrib> fami: failed how?
[03:41] <delire> PresuntoRJ: yes, it's a pretty landmark release i think..
[03:41] <magnetron> innerreflection: ok, you lost me there, but check ventrilo in Appdb database
[03:41] <clop> i guess because my other hard drive is ATA-100 whereas this one is SATA
[03:41] <NickGarvey> pdusen: oh I see, well.. I just wanted to see if you had an "inet address" or not
[03:41] <david__> hey all. i was wondering if there was a way i could make my windows partition writable in ubuntu
[03:41] <tristil> clop, Yeah, I'm thinking about that. Because I saw this:
[03:41] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: you might look into LVM.  Which allows you to resize partitions on the fly
[03:41] <clop> but the other drive doesn't have anything useful on it
[03:41] <HasratUSA> PresuntoRJ: do you have an nvidia graphics card?
[03:41] <rukuartic> !ntfs > david__
[03:41] <tristil> clop, http://www.thejemreport.com/mambo/content/view/309/122/1/19/
[03:41] <sthompson> thanks jrib. I'll take a look at it.

[03:42] <a514> Hi i d/l the Restricted Nvidia Driver & Desktop Effects the cube worked for a sec? Can anyone help or relate

[03:42] <ubotu> david: To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions . For write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[03:42] <oblib> MrMakeveli, seems like it would make more sense just to keep the /home partition and delete the files you don't want. I generally try to avoid resizing/moving partitions in case something goes wrong. What you are planning should work fine, but in any case, I hope you have a backup of important stuff in case it blows up...
[03:42] <david__> ok, thanks
[03:42] <tristil> clop, that's a stab in the dark.
[03:42] <samk> most popular window manager?
[03:42] <clop> tristil, aye, but it does sound possible
[03:42] <clop> is there a way to forcibly have grub install to a drive?
[03:42] <Ax4> !vista
[03:42] <ubotu> vista is the new operating system by the evil overlords from Redmond. For more information, see http://www.badvista.org
[03:42] <Pelo> samk,   gnome or kde , your choice
[03:42] <clop> maybe i can just install it on both drives
[03:42] <Ax4> lol
[03:42] <jrib> fami: pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
[03:42] <clop> i don't have any other os's
[03:42] <pdusen> NickGarvey: I actually remember that the 7.04 installer told me explicitly that it failed to connect to my DHCP server, so I'm fairly sure I'm having a device issue. Is there anything I can do about it?
[03:42] <Ax4> god i love bot coders with sense of humor :)
[03:42] <clop> the ata drive is just a media holder
[03:42] <neozen> clop: man grub-install
[03:43] <clop> ok will do
[03:43] <MrMakeveli> oblib, wont everything just stay the same for setting and everything if i keep my home? grr maybe i'll just leave my /home alone
[03:43] <MrMakeveli> haah
[03:43] <tristil> clop, I don't fully understand it, but the part about Ubuntu and UUID sounds like it could be something.
[03:43] <Glitch012> Oddball question,  are their mount commands in ubuntu for beta versions of WinFS?
[03:43] <Flannel> !grub > clop
[03:43] <Flannel> clop: check the query from ubotu
=== Par_Tay is now known as ^_^

[03:43] <Flannel> clop: the first link, that is.
[03:43] <MrMakeveli> flan, hmm anything special about it over gparted?
[03:43] <bambie> hrmm
[03:43] <bambie> strange
[03:43] <a514> Hi the Sound Recorder does not work? anyone here know this?
[03:43] <MrMakeveli> Flannel,
[03:43] <NickGarvey> pdusen: perhaps it is a driver issue?  do you know what one you need?
[03:43] <bambie> i cannot type my username for something?
[03:43] <bambie> lol
[03:43] <magnetron> !sound | a514
[03:43] <bambie> *for some reason*
[03:43] <ubotu> a514: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[03:43] <rukuartic> bambie: I'm not sure ewe understand you.
[03:43] <delire> PresuntoRJ: HasratUSA has a point. i have had problems with the proprietary ATI drivers (fglrx) and video in the past.. though a long time ago now. include information about your driver in the bug report.
[03:43] <aragirn> I upgraded to Feisty from Edgy today and have run into a problem I've never encountered in Linux before.  Gnome is behaving very oddly; alt+tab no longer works and I am now limited to one workspace.  Whenever I launch an application, it's menu bar appears on the top panel where my Applications, Places, and Systems menus normally are.  Finally, when I try to launch, "System -> Preferences -> Windows" I get the following error
[03:44] <aragirn> message: "Cannot start the preferences application for your window manager.  Window manager "unknown" has not registered a configuration tool."
[03:44] <Pelo> bambie,  cannot type it where ?
[03:44] <rukuartic> bambie: Where are you trying to type your password?
[03:44] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: Gparted is a program to format stuff.  LVM is a system of partitioning that allows you to shift stuff around later.
=== Hacker is now known as ^_^
[03:44] <bambie> when you log on to ubuntu
[03:44] <oblib> MrMakeveli, yes, that is usually why you want to keep your /home. If you want to kill all your settings, then delete the .program_names (.mozilla for example) directories.
[03:44] <bambie> it does asks for username / password
[03:44] <tristil> clop, oh sure, I had to do that with my Macbook.
[03:44] <Pelo> bambie,  usb keyboard ?
[03:44] <bambie> no
[03:44] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, shift it around later?
[03:44] <rukuartic> bambie: When you press the keys on the keyboard, does it write in the box?
[03:44] <fami> jrib: http://www.divshare.com/download/436928-764
[03:44] <bambie> no it does not
[03:44] <IncredibleHink> jrib, hey man i have a quick couple of questions...
[03:44] <Pelo> bambie,   can you type the password ?
[03:45] <delire> tristil: how does 7.04 run on the macbook?
[03:45] <pdusen> NickGarvey: As far as my network adapter... It's an onboard adapter, on my 939Dual-SATA2 mobo.
[03:45] <rukuartic> bambie: Try this... press ctrl+alt+backspace and see if the screen goes black for a second
[03:45] <magnetron> !mac
[03:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about mac - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:45] <jrib> IncredibleHink: ask the channel.  If I know, I'll try to help
[03:45] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: yeah.  If you have 100GB /home and 10 on /, and you find youre running out of space, you can move some /home to /, without even rebooting
[03:45] <magnetron> !macintosh
[03:45] <MrMakeveli> oblib, i really would like everything to be completely fresh, apart from important files such as work documents and my lil indie movies, etc and music
[03:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about macintosh - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:45] <bambie> i can't skip? i've to type username first right? than password
[03:45] <IncredibleHink> jrib, k
[03:45] <NickGarvey> pdusen: do you know if it was detected in dmesg?
[03:45] <LabThug_hm> anyone have a direct link to the torrent for the alternate CD?  The download page on ubuntu.com is unable to access the database.
[03:45] <pdusen> NickGarvey: I don't, is there a way I can find out?
[03:45] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, oh i see what you mean. is it made for gnome or kde? or independent of both?
[03:45] <aib> i'm looking for a chat client that does code highlighting and won't reformat my input AT ALL
[03:46] <tristil> delire, It's great now. It was trouble getting it on, but I think Ubiquity has been patched since I installed it.
[03:46] <rukuartic> bambie: Did you press ctrl+alt+backspace?
[03:46] <fami> jrib: http://www.divshare.com/download/436928-764 that's my sources.list
[03:46] <Pelo> LabThug_hm,   try searching on www.torrentz.com
[03:46] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: it's completely independant.  Here's some more info: http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lvm/  nice graphics and stuff.  You'll need the alternate CD though, Desktop doesn't have support for it.
[03:46] <aragirn> LabThug_hm, here's an ISO mirror for you, http://lug.mtu.edu/iso/ubuntu/7.04/
[03:46] <aragirn> it should be pretty fast
[03:46] <tristil> clop, http://bin-false.org/?p=17
[03:46] <aoliax> good luck all
[03:46] <aragirn> it's on a 10 megabit pipe
[03:46] <Nerdz> I just tried to install Ubuntu and I booted from the CD. Then, I selected "Check for disc error" and there wasn't any. I then selected Start/Install and when the orange status bar was finish, there was only a orange screen with a mouse... Nothin was displayed except the orange background. Is this a common error?
[03:46] <delire> tristil: right, i'm not a big fan of OS X but i notice a few friends have asked about installing Ubuntu on their macbooks.
[03:46] <LabThug_hm> aragirn: thanks!
[03:46] <foug> what is the command to install opera through terminal?
[03:46] <IncredibleHink> Whats the difference in /usr/username /home/username  /lib /bin..... i want to install a program but only make it available to my username....... i also want to install a program and install it for all usernames..... how does that work?
[03:46] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: obviously, all the compiling and stuff on that page doesn't apply to ubuntu.  But the opening paragraphs explain LVM really well
[03:46] <a514> Yeah so the Sound Recorder seems to record but when it does not playback? yeah and alsa is working
[03:46] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, what other differences are there for the alternate vs normal?
[03:46] <oblib> MrMakeveli, do you have enough space to copy the files you want to save to one of your existing partitions? If so, copy them over (so to /var/home or something), erase everything in your /home partition, and then copy it back.
[03:47] <oblib> MrMakeveli, LVM is cool but fairly complicated
[03:47] <jrib> fami: that page is timing out here, can you use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org ?
[03:47] <Pelo> foug,  probably sudo apt-get opera
[03:47] <magnetron> foug: use "add/ remove programs", no need for terminal
[03:47] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: Alternate is a textmode installer, instead of a lvieCD.  You boot up, and go straiht to the installer.  Alternate also has additional options (a GUI-less install, OEM install, etc)
[03:47] <foug> Pelo: nope didn't work, that's what i tried
[03:47] <MrMakeveli> oblib, i'll check out that site in one sec
[03:47] <jrib> !fhs > IncredibleHink    (IncredibleHink, see the private message from ubotu)
[03:47] <jrib> IncredibleHink: what program?
[03:47] <foug> magnetron: would rather use terminal
[03:47] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, *excuse me
[03:47] <Pelo> foug,   apt-cache search  keyword
[03:47] <aragirn> anyone available to help me with a Gnome problem?
[03:47] <tristil> delire, Actually, there might still be issues for the network card, because it switched from the first generation Atheros, which I have.
[03:47] <IncredibleHink> jrib, azureus for my username only
[03:47] <MrMakeveli> oblib, my var is fairly small, 3 gb or so
[03:47] <Nerdz> I got my ubuntu form torrent... I'll try again!
[03:47] <hagabaka> hmm
[03:48] <MrMakeveli> oblib, it might squeek by though
[03:48] <tristil> delire, err wireless.
[03:48] <delire> aragirn: that is an odd problem you have. perhaps try in #gnome also..
[03:48] <NickGarvey> pdusen: mm.. not from windows..
[03:48] <Pelo> aragr wath is the problem ?
[03:48] <delire> tristil: yep, gotcha ;)
[03:48] <hagabaka> i get a segmentation fault when trying to install classpath-gtkpeer
[03:48] <bimberi> !verify | Nerdz
[03:48] <ubotu> Nerdz: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[03:48] <MrMakeveli> oblib, you are saying to move it there, format others, install while leaving /var the same. and then moving back after install?
[03:48] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: oh, Aternate CD also has a repository on it.  So you get full ubntu install + additional packages without the internet.
[03:48] <magnetron> foug: if you are up for a challenge, start with man apt-get and work your way from there
[03:48] <oblib> MrMakeveli, you can do what you were planning originally, probably without any problems. It's just a general rule to back up before messing around with partitions
[03:48] <delire> hehe
[03:48] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, cd or dvd?
[03:48] <fami> jrib: yes, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16473/
[03:48] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: CD
[03:48] <pdusen> NickGarvey: I can reboot if I really have too. It's just a hassle. I really want to get my network adapter working properly, though.
[03:48] <aragirn> thanks delire
[03:49] <hagabaka> oh no
[03:49] <MrMakeveli> oblib, the problem is that this kind of IS my back up. haha
[03:49] <foug> magnetron: the command man does what
[03:49] <bambie> bleh
[03:49] <rukuartic> Hey, if I reboot in the middle of a distro upgrade using the package manager, does it bork?
[03:49] <bambie> i just restarted and it did work
[03:49] <magnetron> foug: it is the manual
[03:49] <rukuartic> bambie: Heh
[03:49] <oblib> Flannel: Do you know LVM well?  I am installing Feisty Fawn from scratch. Do I need to do anything special to make sure my new install recognizes my LVM drives?
[03:49] <hagabaka> i'm actually getting segmentation fault when running aptitude, or apt-get :(
[03:49] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, why would anyone do the normal over the alternate then?
[03:49] <rukuartic> bambie: sometimes its just weird little problems
[03:49] <fami> jrib: yes, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16473/ this's my sources.list
[03:49] <Pelo> rukuartic,   if you are in the middle of the download,  you can stop it before rebooting
[03:49] <bambie> yeah
[03:49] <rukuartic> bambie: How is it? I'm still updating :(
[03:49] <Flannel> oblib: Setup your LVM in the installer
[03:49] <rukuartic> Pelo: There's no cancel button
[03:49] <bambie> i've 6.06
[03:49] <bambie> and my wireless doesn't works
[03:49] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: because some people like the liveCD aspect, and the pretty GUI installer.
[03:49] <HasratUSA> why would you need to reboot in the middle of a distro upgrade?
[03:50] <NickGarvey> pdusen: is there another computer you have by any chance?
[03:50] <jrib> IncredibleHink: one way to do it would be to install azureus using Synaptic or Add/Remove and then changing the permissions on the binary
[03:50] <rukuartic> HasratUSA: Thats not the question though.
[03:50] <Josesordo> =( error in upgrade
[03:50] <something_else> people, just installed feisty, but it strangely falls to busybox
[03:50] <oblib> Flannel, its not one of my main partitions, just a mythtv data partition. Will the installer just prompt to restore it or something?
[03:50] <rukuartic> HasratUSA: Lets say the power borks on me.
[03:50] <Flannel> oblib: oh, you have additional LVM drives?  No.  Just add them to fstab
[03:50] <bayziders> Yes I am geting decent upgrade speeds =DD
[03:50] <NickGarvey> pdusen: honestly, I can't guarentee you 100% attention all the time, so if you reboot, get all this info, and then I take off, I'd just be wasting your time
[03:50] <fami> bambie: deb-src in sources.list? when i need it?
[03:50] <bambie> brb guys.
[03:50] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, hmmm
[03:50] <NickGarvey> pdusen: I mean I should be here, but I can never know
[03:50] <IncredibleHink> jrib, that would work, but i really want to learn linux.... im very inquisitive
[03:50] <toxickiwi> Anyone know how long an upgrade from the alt CD should take?  Mine has been going for 3 hours so far.
[03:50] <Flannel> oblib: It should see it.  When you're mounting partitions, you should be able to add it
[03:50] <ahmed> .
[03:51] <fami> Flannel: deb-src is in sources.list. when i need it?
[03:51] <foug> magnetron: awesome thanks, but how do i get out of it? hehe
[03:51] <pdusen> NickGarvey: There are other computers in the house, but I don't have anything else I can actively use while I figure this out.
[03:51] <something_else> anyone else having problems with it not booting to hard disk?
[03:51] <jrib> IncredibleHink: k, what do you want to learn?
[03:51] <oblib> Flannel, I thought it would, but wanted to make sure before I lost it forever :)
[03:51] <magnetron> foug: "Q"
[03:51] <clop> omfg it works!!
[03:51] <foug> q
[03:51] <Flannel> fami: No you really don't need -src stuff
[03:51] <clop> i have to manually edit the grub command to get it to boot but i guessed right
[03:51] <HasratUSA> clop ?
[03:51] <HasratUSA> oh
[03:51] <aaroncampbell> Has anyone here used lightscribe on (K)Ubuntu?
[03:51] <clop> tristil, thanks a lot for your help
[03:51] <fami> Flannel:  disable all -src?
[03:51] <foug> magnetron: cool
[03:51] <PresuntoRJ> delire: sorry, what point? I was collecting information for the bug report
[03:52] <ubuntu> this is bad
[03:52] <ubuntu> hye i cn;t upgrade to 7
[03:52] <PresuntoRJ> delire: i have missed the other comment
[03:52] <ubuntu> i can't upgrade to 7
[03:52] <tristil> clop, Cool. I realized it was similar to some of the Mac problems I had.
[03:52] <MrMakeveli> grr i think im just gonnainstall
[03:52] <bimberi> ubuntu: why?
[03:52] <tonyr1988> aaroncampbell: Not personally, but there are drivers for it. Need any help?
[03:52] <ubuntu> when i put the cd it is not showing
[03:52] <ubuntu> upgrade option
[03:52] <foug> when i resize windows by dragging them it kind of lags. Why? They were not diong this when I was runing the live CD
[03:52] <IncredibleHink> jrib, say i download a tar'd package online... i want to install that package for my username.... I would unpack it (know how to do that), and put it where?    in an opt or other containing folder in my home directory?
[03:52] <Flannel> fami: it shouldnt matter one way or the other
[03:52] <bimberi> ubuntu: Desktop CD? Or Alternate?
[03:53] <IncredibleHink> jrib, or would it be better to put in /opt and change the permissions?
[03:53] <ubuntu> ufff
[03:53] <magnetron> bimberi: almost no viruses, nice interface, stable
[03:53] <ubuntu> mometn
[03:53] <ubuntu> noooo
[03:53] <aaroncampbell> tonyr1988: Well, I have 2 lightscribe capable DVD burners, and I'd love to be able to use it
[03:53] <ubuntu> desktop i386
[03:53] <Flannel> ubuntu: Desktop, you're on the liveCD.  Alternate is the only one that you can upgrade with.
[03:53] <ubuntu> i have x86

[03:55] <jason0_> I upgraded last night using the -c -d option before the official announcement  but now fear I may have upgraded to the "beta". How can I confirm?
[03:55] <xorl> There any AIM clients similar to Miranda-IM for ubuntu, that are themeable as such?
[03:55] <ubuntu> gksu sh cdrom/cdromupgrade in now working
[03:55] <jrib> ubuntu: you can only upgrade from edgy if you use the alternate cd, the desktop cd cannot be used to upgrade
[03:55] <dfawerefaef> ubotu: what is the alternate cd for?
[03:56] <ubuntu> jrib i have ubuntu 6.10
[03:56] <dc> please help! my dist upgrade has stalled at fetching/installing updates; what do i do?!
[03:56] <magnetron> !final | jason0_
[03:56] <ubotu> jason0_: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.

[03:56] <IncredibleHink> jrib, cool!! Bookmarked. I had a hard drive crash last week and even though windows wasn't to blame, I felt the need for a change. I installed 6.10 and upgraded last night to 7.04 and have liked it so far minus the few setup headaches (although they have been fun to figure out).
[03:56] <ubotu> dfawerefaef: The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[03:56] <LabThug_hm> HasratUSA: no, 100% CrapCasting
[03:56] <HasratUSA> dc it hasn't stalled

[03:59] <IncredibleHink> jrib, understood
[03:59] <dc> does anyone know how to cancel dist-upgrade ?
[03:59] <jrib> ubuntu: either use the online repositories or download the Alternate CD

[04:00] <[acid] Neatchee> infact, right now, it's actually up 270ms
[04:00] <HasratUSA> dc i would recommend that you don't quit it because for example, on my end, sometimes it's stalling when it's not getting enough speed due to heavy demand and whenever it's getting some speed/bandwidth, it's downloading the file. if you don't have a problem with keeping it open for a few hours, then don't kill it
[04:00] <dc> IncredibleHink: i use innotech virtualbox (spelling may be bad).  you can install any os onto it
[04:00] <Vuen_> seamus7: if the dist-upgrade is still in the download phase, then yes.
[04:00] <usser> yep figured that =) oh well its only 22 hours to go after all
[04:01] <gursikh> Hey I know dpkg --get-selections lists all my installed apps, how to print a list of apps I installed (the list minus whatever is default)
[04:01] <dfawerefaef> dc: if its still downloading, nothing has changed yet
[04:01] <Vuen_> seamus7: cancel it before you put the cd in the drive. it should autorun and offer to upgrade.
[04:01] <IncredibleHink> dc, do you run windows on it?
[04:01] <dc> HasratUSA: i have to take my laptop to class tomorrow :0
[04:01] <dc> IncredibleHink: i run winxp home, but used to run pro

[04:08] <keith> llol, do I need to forward the port that the server is listening on?
[04:08] <llol> u have to remember to set DMZ on urself
[04:08] <LabThug_hm> "[Torrentz's]  hamster powered servers are too busy and begging for few seconds of rest.
[04:08] <kILLu> i can't install gstreamer plugins for mp3 etc cuz the download wont work
[04:08] <deepsa> NickGarvey: where will i get mp3/wmv then in the cd?
[04:09] <fami> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16481/
[04:09] <dc> seamus7: try restarting.  and if you could, please come back to this chat and tell me if it worked
[04:09] <Sterk> duelboot, if anyone else asks, sudo apt-get install knetworkmanager
[04:09] <maccam94> kILLu, i think the server's are a bit overloaded at the moment
[04:09] <llol> even if you try to connect to urself dont use the IP that was provided to ur by ur router
[04:09] <Humjaba> seamus7: i second that notion from dc :D
[04:09] <bimberi> keith: yes, port 5900
[04:09] <dc> seamus7: but i dont get messages so please come back
[04:09] <dc> Humjaba: ;)
[04:09] <llol> instead enter ur true IP
[04:09] <seamus7> Oh everyone wants me to be the sacrificial lamb !!! lol
[04:09] <IncredibleHink> i have setup linux on a single harddrive, i have a 320gb hard drive coming in the mail tomorrow. How hard would it be to move my home directory to the new drive and keep things functioning? Is that a big deal?
[04:09] <Humjaba> seamus7: indeed ;)
[04:09] <keith> llol, thanks
[04:09] <llol> but DMZ

[04:10] <Zues_62> ok does anyone know does the upgrade delete my current xorg.conf i need to know this
[04:10] <HasratUSA> anyone who would want to kill the download process of feisty fawn: open up system monitor (you can find it in system > administration > system monitor.) and see if you have a process named 'feisty'. right click on it and choose kill
[04:10] <dc> :)
[04:10] <gerry_> NickGarvey:  i got "no LSB modules are available" error
[04:10] <llol> it updates it
[04:10] <NickGarvey> gerry_: you need the -a
[04:10] <dc> i hope this works
[04:10] <jrib> fami: this only started happening today I'm guessing?
[04:10] <AnRkey> how do i run the windows to ubuntu migration tool after i have installed?
[04:10] <llol> zues
[04:10] <Zues_62> llol what u mean it updates it?
[04:10] <llol> from what i see
[04:10] <llol> no changes
[04:10] <NickGarvey> deepsa: perhaps the dvd is what you need, I am unsure what is on the dvd though, make sure the mp3 things are on there
[04:10] <llol> leaves it intact
[04:11] <keith>  llol: does the port listen on TCP or UDP?
[04:11] <dc> Humjaba: do you think it will work?
[04:11] <tom__> hey guys i'm having a little bit of trouble updating through the update-manager, it's not actually doing anytihng
[04:11] <jrib> fami: make sure you are using the "au.archive" instead of just "archive" for everyithing

[04:12] <MikeFromOz> hi, I am trying to installing Ubuntu and having some problems - can someone help me?
[04:12] <jrib> fami: line 18 doesn't specify au.archive
[04:12] <JebJoya> was weird - wireless was working before i made the upgrade to feisty... wasn't last time i shutdown... :)

[04:13] <JebJoya> ahh well, all's well and all that

[04:13] <magnetron> !anyone
[04:13] <NickGarvey> JebJoya: if you use ndiswrapper you need to redo it for every new kernel upgrade
[04:13] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:13] <wastrel> what's msi
[04:13] <minttea> I have a problem with nvidia drivers, they are installed and working, but my dual montiors don't work with dual x servers (I don't want twinview)...If I do twinview anyway, it forgets when I restart x, if I do dual x servers, x gets messed up when I restart x, and I have to revert to a working xorg.conf (single monitor) x file
[04:13] <MikeFromOz> The install is stuck on 82% saying "Configuring apt" "Scanning the mirror"
[04:13] <ricardo> hi i really need help. my ubuntu dont wanna read my msi player, its weird., it show it for a sec then it dissapear
[04:13] <AnRkey> keith, remote desktop in ubuntu is vncserver so it's port 5800 for the webserver
[04:13] <NemesisD> hi, i've got some shared files i want to edit on some windows machines on my network, the problem is that the windows computers use NTFS, is it safe to write if this is the case?
[04:13] <NickGarvey> wastrel: microsoft installer I believe
[04:13] <yagiska> :( no fun having feisty if i can't download packages... guess i'll just let it sit for a bit
[04:13] <MikeFromOz> been like that for 30 mins
[04:13] <yagiska> thanks
[04:13] <keith> wastrel, do you mean the microsoft software installer?
[04:13] <JebJoya> NickGarvey - seems to just... work :)
[04:13] <JebJoya> yay
[04:13] <JebJoya> :D
[04:13] <llol> keith ur better off using vncviewer
[04:13] <NickGarvey> JebJoya: oh good :)
[04:13] <dc> MikeFromOz: the servers are overloaded right now, there is a bunch of people downloading.  it is very slow
[04:13] <llol> it takes care of all teh routing stuff
[04:13] <ricardo> hi i really need help. my ubuntu dont wanna read my msi player, its weird., it show it for a sec then it dissapear
[04:14] <ytsestef> MikeFromOz, cancel the installation, log out, in again and reinstall
[04:14] <LabThug_hm> sigh, mtu.edu was fleeting, it's back down to 0.1KB/s now :-(
[04:14] <keith> llol, I know, just curious if I should forward 5900, or a range of like, 5900-5902 etc.
[04:14] <bimberi> gawd here we go (B-G)
[04:14] <keith> I know that if you have multiple connections, it's on higher port numbers
[04:14] <MikeFromOz> ok... thanks ytsestef
[04:14] <llol> it really wont make a diff
[04:14] <LabThug_hm> but the torrent is at 250 KB/s :-D
[04:14] <JebJoya> did have one issue during the installation, had to upgrade some stuff before i started, and after the reboot all the text was... well, squares
[04:14] <gerry_> i don't know whether the xgl+ati+compiz work in final release
[04:14] <JebJoya> anyone know about that?
[04:14] <maccam94> ricardo, i can't really help, but maybe describe what an msi player is...
[04:14] <philip> where do I get the torrent for 7.04? I only get the iso from mirrors
[04:14] <llol> cuz its gonna go to whoever is either doing the remote
[04:14] <ytsestef> MikeFromOz: it happened to me too ;)
[04:14] <JebJoya> it's sorted now, but y'know, thought you might want to know :)
[04:14] <dc> seamus7: yo
[04:14] <ricardo> hi i really need help. my ubuntu dont wanna read my msi player, its weird., it show it for a sec then it dissapear
[04:14] <BILL-GATES> I failed to intall 7.04 now im trying alternate
[04:15] <seamus7> Success! I restarted and the dist-upgrad cacelled ... though the upgrade manager is now asking me to finish the upgrade process by doing a dist-upgrade ... it sees all the packages that have already been downloaded and wants to install them ... but I closed it. and my alt CD is asking me to upgrade so I'm now going down that path.
[04:15] <magnetron> gerry_: aiglx is installed by default, compiz bundled
[04:15] <NemesisD> is it safe to edit (write) files on NTFS machines on my network?
[04:15] <ytsestef> had anyone the luck to play a video back using the opengl output plugin under aiglx? (ANY player...)
[04:15] <dc> seamus7: sweet thank you so much!
[04:15] <maccam94> philip: http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent

[04:16] <llol> u needed to make a BOOT partition for it
[04:16] <magnetron> NemesisD: if you edit files over file sharing, it doesn't matter which file system it is

[04:24] <NickGarvey> bimberi: eh.. I'm sure some lurk.. or will come across it in a minuter or two and slap me around
[04:24] <Ax4> Quite simply, Adobe removed the right of third parties to distribute the software, so Ubuntu can't provide the software anymore. But I do agree that evince just doesn't do the job very well. Adobe Reader blows it out of the water.
[04:24] <BILL-GATES> foug, dont fix it if its not broken

[04:40] <kILLu> xucrute: then you need to resize your ntfs partition to make it smaller, create a 512 mb swap partition and the rest (i suggest 10 gb) ext3 with mount point /
[04:40] <BlackDalek> so what can this nfsd do for me?
[04:40] <kondor101> well someone should tell head office, because the download page ubuntu.com leads you to does not have it

[04:53] <pppoe_dude> MikeFromOz, did you do an integrity check?
[04:53] <CodingZen> PresuntoRJ: so howdo i change respositories?
[04:53] <MikeFromOz> no
[04:53] <PresuntoRJ> looknglass: most br users keep their setting to the original, I guess
[04:53] <Tonren> DARKGuy: Yeah, I'm just asking everywhere at once
[04:53] <Humjaba> stefg: :( The mirrors now are crying
[04:53] <Tonren> Abom: Okey doke

[04:53] <function1> are there other servers from which i can begin the feisty update process? synaptic seems to only allow me to pick from "US Server" and "Main Server"

[04:54] <Frog29> Anyone up for helping out a new tty error after updating to 7.04? (i had it after updating to 6.10 as well....)
[04:54] <Pelo> gils,   no problem  anything to take the load off the servers
[04:54] <wobx> DARKGuy: compiling is not much of an issue but again compiling from source will mostly work for i386 where with 64 bit you have to be lucky enough to even get some adapted source code
[04:54] <Nerdz> I tried to start in graphic safe and normal

[04:54] <kofwang> could anyone help me ? boot fail!
[04:54] <looknglass> PresuntoRJ: yeah hehe
[04:54] <Nerdz> I still get a orange/yellow screen with a mouse
[04:54] <Abom> Tonren: run adobe's gamma loader, it's set to run on windows by default
[04:54] <Abom> err
[04:54] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: in there, type gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:54] <Pelo> Frog29,  you should know better, just ask the question
[04:54] <Abom> does anyone know how to connect to an open wireless network that doesn't require a password in ubuntu?
[04:54] <Ax4> im so glad i did all my feisty updating a week ago
[04:54] <Ax4> lmao
[04:54] <Ax4> suckas!
[04:54] <Ax4> :D
[04:54] <Tonren> Abom: Yeah, I heard the first time - trying it now
[04:54] <Frog29> Pelo - i get a tty error after updating to 7.04 from 6.10 - what do i do?
[04:54] <Pelo> Ax4,  lovely attitude
[04:54] <gils> pelo: when was this torrent released. what is on this dvd ? does it have the april 15th release
[04:54] <Abom> sorry, I reposted on accident :)
[04:54] <chowmeined> When I try to open a pdf I get the error that the extension is of type "pdf document" but the file is of type "PDF document" and it wont open
[04:55] <kofwang> Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxxxxx-xxx-xx-xxxx dose not exist, Dropping to a shell!!
[04:55] <zilly6> is something wrong with the repositories today
[04:55] <Ax4> Pelo, im just messing :p runnin' to subway, cya!
[04:55] <Abom> trying to get an answer to my issue, I can't get online :(
[04:55] <DARKGuy> wobx: yeah, I thought that issue was "lighter" in this new version, as 64-bit was a hell to use with Linux about one or two years ago
[04:55] <Pelo> Frog29,   I donT' knwo ,  same thing as the last time you had the problem I guess
[04:55] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: where you read "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com" change to "deb http://br.archive.ubuntu.com"
[04:55] <Frog29> pelo - it freezes at a small sliver of a bar at the startup screen then drops to the tty thing
[04:55] <Humjaba> my windows machine is crying now too... uninstalling office, encoding a dvd and downloading ubuntu install cd... on a single-core amd 3200+ :(
[04:55] <pppoe_dude> !slow > zilly6
[04:55] <Pelo> gils,   I got this torrent from the ubuntu site earlier today it's the latest official one
[04:55] <Frog29> Pelo - i'm trying that but... well.... i don't think i changed my grunb settings unless the update did
[04:55] <Abom> does anyone know how to connect to an open wireless network that doesn't require a password in ubuntu?
[04:55] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: than you can update the repositories cache (apt-get update or aptitude) and go on installing your stuff
[04:55] <kondor101> i am emailing webmaster to ask if he can add a link to the torrents page, can someone be kind and call up the torrents page again
[04:55] <CodingZen> PresuntoRJ: which one... i see a bunch
[04:55] <Tonren> Abom: It didn't work.  I closed Photoshop, ran the gamma loader and opened Photoshop again.  No dice.
[04:55] <wobx> torrent is generally the faster way to download ISOs, but that's mainly because the ftp/http mirrors are shaped (well i'd do that as well if i had to pay for the bandwidth)
[04:56] <gils> Pelo: cool, thanks
[04:56] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen:all of them

[04:57] <Artemis3> cool, thats the max users the channel has reached?
[04:57] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: right... just ADD the br. before the word ARCHIVE
[04:57] <Flannel> stiv2k: because that package doesn't exist
[04:57] <pppoe_dude> Artemis3, nah it was like 1500 earlier
[04:57] <Abom> Tonren: so everything's working now? :) maybe photoshop was interpreting you're computer as if it were windows or something
[04:58] <whonicca> in feisty, is it just me when changing wall papers where u get the option to tile, fill, zoom or stretch, scale the wallpaper, no matter what u choose it stays filled i think, is anyone else having this bug?
[04:58] <Tonren> Abom: I dunno what turning off color management reallyd oes, though. I hope it doesn't break something else down the road
[04:58] <Frog29> is there any way to find out what kernel version i have by viewing the file system through windows with the ubuntu drive mounted?
[04:58] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: you could choose other places, BR is for Brazil, CA for Canada, DE for germany... and so on... it meant
[04:58] <wobx> DARKGuy: but you have to decide rather early..when you didn't already put much effort in your system..because afaik there's no way to dist-upgrade from i386 to *64 vice versa
[04:58] <pppoe_dude> Frog29, cd /lib/moules
[04:58] <eric> crimsun: just wanted to let you know, it worked. awesome man. cheers ;P
[04:59] <ceil420> is there a command to see if you already have a package installed that doesn't involve opening Synaptic?
[04:59] <IgnacioMiller> crimsun: Same here, I owe you one.

[05:00] <Wiseguy> hey guys, how come there arent as many packages listed anymore when the multiverse repo is selected? for some reason it seems all of the repos are checked in the list, but its still only showing 1052 packages
[05:00] <Flannel> stiv2k: right.  I know.  Im trying to figure that out too.  Uh, make sure you have a newest package cache (sudo apt-get update)
[05:00] <Abom> has anyone succesfully connected to a wireless connection that doesn't require a password?
[05:00] <CodingZen> PresuntoRJ: dont they speak french too?

[05:01] <CodingZen> PresuntoRJ:  LOL
[05:01] <stiv2k> Flannel: just did that ill do it again though
[05:01] <TehUni> slyfox: google is your friend... but i'll pm you one of mine as an example
[05:01] <pppoe_dude> Abom, you just need to do sudo network-admin and configure the wireless interface from there

[05:01] <Flannel> stiv2k: I'll Ask around, since... yeah, I dont see it
[05:01] <Abom> pppoe_dude: what's sudo-network admin?
[05:01] <vafada> difference between alternate and desktop iso?
[05:01] <pope523> I'm having trouble getting XOrg to work on my Sun Ultra 5 and I saw some posts on the net about a bug that keeps this from working. Does anyone know anything about this?
[05:01] <Ambrosious> is there some way that I can remove the need to enter my password all the time?
[05:01] <Pelo> DeX-aNoM-MwG-,   recovery mode ? I realy donT' know much about your problem
[05:01] <fyi> i had no idea this was coming out today, hahaha
[05:01] <Frog29> would the ubuntu update have updatd GRUB or added an entry if one was dual booting and had a seperate boot partition?
[05:01] <pppoe_dude> Abom, type 'sudo network-admin' in a terminal
[05:02] <joejaxx> vafada: Desktop is livecd based; alternative is a text installer
[05:02] <DeX-aNoM-MwG-> Pelo: Thanks :)
[05:02] <stefg> DeX-aNoM-MwG-: if you have a console you could login in text mode... boot in 'recovery' mode then no attempt will be made to start X and crash your box

[05:02] <bimberi> kondor101: I hope that's not the reason.  Anyway I've asked via a comment on that bug
[05:02] <Wiseguy> is anyone else having troubles reloading package information in synaptic?
[05:02] <Pelo> Frog29,  yes it would edit grub since you would have a  new  kernel in there
[05:02] <gr3ml1n> hi
[05:02] <vafada> joejaxx,  thanks
[05:02] <rellik_> if I want to upgrade to the latest stable release of ubuntu, is it 'apt-get install dist-upgrade'?  do I have to change the lines in my sources.list that all say 'dapper' ?

[05:02] <Nerdz> My problem is: When I try to install ubuntu, I select the Start/Install menu, then I see the ubuntu logo with a progress bar at the bottom. When the progress bar reach the end, I see a black screen and then, I see a orange/yellow screen and I only have my mouse. I have waited 10minutes to this window and still nothing. What can I do to solve this? Thanks
[05:02] <dc> yo
[05:02] <llol> if i were to want to make the CLOSE minimize and maximize buttons were do i go?
[05:02] <gr3ml1n> when i enter manual settings in the gnome network manager applet i cant connect although i did nothing wrong :O
[05:02] <Frog29> Pelo - would it add a new entry or just edit it? becasue i still only have one ubuntu entry (and a recovery)
[05:03] <ricardo> brasil?
[05:03] <RAOF> rellik_: No!  *Don't* do that, you'll almost certainly break something.
[05:03] <dc> where can i find the torrent?
[05:03] <pppoe_dude> rellik_, update-manager should automatically tell you of a new version
[05:03] <llol> i mean MAKE them bigger
[05:03] <stiv2k> why is X saying it cant find the nvidia kernel module when i have linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic installed
[05:03] <Pelo> wiseelben,  not I was talking to Frog29
[05:03] <RAOF> !upgrade | rellik_
[05:03] <ubotu> rellik_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:03] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: since the files are released to the original repository and THEN copied to the mirrors, it might take a few minutes for the upgrades to spread to the other countries... but usually not more than 30 min or so
[05:03] <RAOF> rellik_: Note that you *have* to upgrade through Edgy.
[05:03] <wobx> i wonder if an upgrade from edgy to feisty is as easy as to put feisty repos into /etc/apt/sources.list and do a apt-get dist-upgrade? or is there anything else to consider?
[05:03] <kofwang>  Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxxxxx-xxx-xx-xxxx dose not exist, Dropping to a shell!! when i try to boot
[05:03] <josesordo--> Failed to fetch http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/dists/edgy/Release Unable to find expected entry  deb-src/binary-i386/Packages in Meta-index file (malformed Release file?) --> Why????
[05:03] <Pelo> Frog29,   it would probabaly also remvoe the older entries since those kernels would not apply to the new version
[05:03] <rellik_> RAOF, pppoe_dude thanks
[05:03] <kondor101> bimberi, good comment
[05:03] <dc> where can i find the fiesty torrent. and do i need to burn a cd do install it?
[05:03] <llol> how do i make the window maximize and close buttons BIGGER?

[05:04] <Abom> pppoe_dude: my ubuntu buddy said we've already tried that and it doesn't work...
[05:04] <Pelo> Frog29,  in all likelyhood it probably made a new grub menu altogether
[05:04] <zntneo> is there any reason why i can't log into ubuntu?
[05:04] <gr3ml1n> can anyone tell me why entering a static ip in the gnome network manager makes my connection not work anymore but dhcp does?
[05:04] <Abom> pppoe_dude: there's some problem with not having a password with wireless connections :(
[05:04] <pppoe_dude> Abom, what wireless card do you have?
[05:04] <RAOF> rellik_: Yes.  Basically, you just have to run "update-manager" twice :)
[05:04] <Frog29> Pelo - hmmm so if i had made some edits to my grub menu settings they would have been lost?
[05:04] <kondor101> dc, it shouldn't say "all" download pages
[05:04] <PresuntoRJ> llol: have you tried changing the Theme to another set that pleases you better?
[05:04] <Abom> pppoe_dude: I have a belkin f5d7000 I think it's called
[05:04] <whonicca> whats the application called that u change ur backgrounds with on ubuntu
[05:04] <llol> i got beryl on
[05:04] <Pelo> llol,   you can probably change the size of the title bar in gconf-editor somewhere  the button size might follow
[05:04] <pppoe_dude> Abom,  is it recognised by ubuntu?
[05:05] <Abom> pppoe_dude: yes
[05:05] <llol> i see
[05:05] <gr3ml1n> can anyone tell me why entering a static ip in the gnome network manager makes my connection not work anymore but dhcp does?
[05:05] <Pelo> Frog29,  that would be my guess,   but it might have been backup
[05:05] <pppoe_dude> Abom, does "iwlist scanning" yield anything?
[05:05] <Frog29> Does anyone know the ner version of the kernel for ubuntu in 7.04?
[05:05] <vafada> i'm getting "can't access tty; Job control turned off" when booting LiveCD :(  i have ubuntu ultimate edition right now so i had no problems with previous ubuntu
[05:05] <Abom> pppoe_dude: yes it does, I can see my router just fine
[05:05] <whonicca> lol this chan is useless at times =\
[05:05] <Pelo> Frog29,   2.6.20 I think
[05:05] <Abom> pppoe_dude: I can see my wireless router, but I time out trying to connect to it... then if i try again it says I'm connected but I'm still not
[05:05] <kondor101> bimberi, actually, they might be trying to count downloads
[05:05] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: can you tell what version of gnome-network-manager do you have installed?
[05:06] <pppoe_dude> Abom, if it does, then you should be able to just use either network-admin and disable roaming mode, or the network-manager applet in the panel
[05:06] <Frog29> Pelo - if that is so then that would explalian my problems
[05:06] <Pelo> whonicca,  I agree, but this is Upgrade day, waht do you expect
[05:06] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ: 0.6.4
[05:06] <lisapc> Feisty sits on my 2nd HDD, but Grub sits on my 1st HDD.  How can I install Grub on my 2nd HDD instead and then boot Ubuntu directly from 2nd HDD?  Anyone know pleasse?
[05:06] <CodingZen> PresuntoRJ: do you know how i turn beryl on?
[05:06] <NemesisD> am i to understand that beryl and compiz cannot be used in conjunction with eachother?
[05:06] <r0bby_> is there anywhere I can find the .config file used to compile the stock kernel?
[05:06] <steve_> what happens if i delete the bottom panel?  will windows be automatically listed on the top panel?
[05:06] <pppoe_dude> Abom, ah
[05:06] <bimberi> r0bby_: /boot
[05:06] <pppoe_dude> Abom, is it definitely not a router issue?
[05:06] <Frog29> Pelo - so /lib/muoles would have the kernel version?
[05:06] <RAOF> NemesisD: Yes, indeed.  They are both window managers, and you can't have two programs managing your windows at the same time :)
[05:06] <Abom> pppoe_dude: someone here hinted that it may be because I have no password so there might be some issue with that
[05:06] <enderxim> what kernel comes with the new feisty iso?
[05:06] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: ok, try o nthe terminal this: dpkg -l | grep gnome-network
[05:06] <stefg> lisapc: bios boots first HD, no matter where you install grub... no way
[05:06] <bimberi> kondor101: yes, perhaps
[05:06] <Pelo> Frog29,  if you can still boot  recovery  mode,  the txt editor is nano and the location of menu.list is /boot/grub ,  so sudo nano  /boot/grub/menu.list
[05:07] <bimberi> enderxim: 2.6.20
[05:07] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: paste the complete version back here
[05:07] <Dial_tone> who's done the inline upgrade yeet? any issues to report?
[05:07] <NemesisD> RAOF, how can i try out beryl instead of compiz and vice versa? i think im on compiz right now
[05:07] <RAOF> NemesisD: You can, however, have both Compiz & Beryl *installed* at the same time (and Metacity, and Kwin, and Fluxbox, and Sawfish, and ...)
[05:07] <Abom> pppoe_dude: I guess it could be, but I can use the internet just fine in windows (that's what I'm on now)
[05:07] <CodingZen> PresuntoRJ: do you know how i turn beryl on?
[05:07] <mbpubuntu> feisty/7.04 just installed today on MacBook Pro mouse not behaving well?  Suggestions?
[05:07] <Pelo> Frog29,  I donT' know where the kernel module would be ,  that,s a bit out of my league
[05:07] <Frog29> Pelo - i have ubuntu mounted in windows.......
[05:07] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ: nothing happens when i paste that in terminal
[05:07] <lisapc> stefg, ROFL!  I can press ESC during POST and it gives me an option to boot from 2nd HDD!  Dont say things you have no idea about, thanks
[05:07] <Frog29> Pelo - ok i'll look it up or ask around :)
[05:07] <PresuntoRJ> CodingZen: it should work if you go to System>Preferences>Effects
[05:07] <pppoe_dude> Abom, try disabling roaming mode in network-admin, then make sure that you select the correct essid and DHCP, then close that window, and do "sudo ifdown <interface> && sudo ifup <interface" where <interface is the network interface (e.g. eth1)
[05:07] <lisapc> stefg, in fact I had it like that with Edgy once, but forgot how I did it
[05:07] <knix_> When I try and upgrade my server to feisty with the command "sudo apt-get install update-manager-core"   It says it cant find it
[05:08] <Pelo> Frog29,  the forum is your friend ,  but it might be too busy to pay attention to you right now
[05:08] <pppoe_dude> *<interface>
[05:08] <lisapc> <stefg> lisapc: bios boots first HD, no matter where you install grub... no way <-- yes way! LOL.  I can boot directly from my 2nd HDD
[05:08] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ: nothing happens when i paste that in terminal
[05:08] <rellik_> RAOF, how can I confirm that I am running 6.06?
[05:08] <gr3ml1n> can anyone tell me why entering a static ip in the gnome network manager makes my connection not work anymore but dhcp does?
[05:08] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: dpkg -l | grep network-manager
[05:08] <Frog29> Pelo- due to the lag and a lot o fothers?
[05:08] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: it must come out a bunch of files and the full version numbers
[05:08] <lisapc> can anyone tell me whats the command to install Grub onto my 2nd HDD?
[05:08] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ:  0.6.4-6ubuntu7
[05:08] <kondor101> i have this strange feeling that 7.04 is going to be the linux to really catch on
[05:08] <grok_linux> pathwap
[05:08] <Pelo> Frog29,  that would be my guess
[05:09] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: ok, you are using the latest
[05:09] <stefg> lisapc: yes... by virtual drive swapping. bios takes 2nd hd as first hd... but still boots the /then/ first one
[05:09] <lisapc> kondor101, define strange
[05:09] <pope523> Does Xorg not run on Ubuntu for Sparc?
[05:09] <Pelo> lisapc,   try asking in #grub
[05:09] <mbpubuntu> anyone here using ubuntu on an intel mac?
[05:09] <Abom> pppoe_dude: thanks, I'll try that, but I don't think I understand everything :o I'll ask my linux friend for detailed help though
[05:09] <Frog29> Pelo - its under /lib/modules btw.... and i tihnk my problem is that the update did not update GRUB to have the most recent kernel version
[05:09] <ricardo> in feisty the soon nvidia one appears in boot?
[05:09] <stiv2k> jesus
[05:09] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: I have been following this bug reports on the Network-manager and it seemed ok
[05:09] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ: what now? i want to use static ip because i need to forward some port to it
[05:09] <lisapc> stefg, be silent pls :)  you talking nonsense again!  I told you, i had Grub boot from my 2nd HDD before
[05:09] <stiv2k> i cant apt-get update without it timing out
[05:09] <lisapc> Pelo, I did ask in grub
[05:09] <kondor101> lisapc, well strange as in people have been saying that sort of thing for years, lol
[05:09] <arraista> is anyone else experiencing *really* long times for installing due to repo servers traffic?
[05:09] <valermos> is anybody else having a problem with the fglrx driver under the new feisty? I'm getting an error "PreInitDAL failed"
[05:09] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: can you manually set it on the config file for the interface?
[05:09] <ricardo> in feisty the soon nvidia one appears in boot?
[05:09] <arnold-8891> For some reason, after upgrading to Feisty, I am not finding any indication anywhere of the existence of a PCI wireless card I have installed in my desktop. Does anyone know how I could fix this?
[05:09] <steelnub> Do you guys help with Beryl here?
[05:09] <lisapc> kondor101, lol
[05:10] <Dekkard> only prob i have is sound recorder.. and audacity.. wont capture..
[05:10] <arraista> i thought the repos would be somehow congested, but not this much...
[05:10] <mbpubuntu> steelnub: there's a room for beryl
[05:10] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: try this: press Alt+F2
[05:10] <Stoffer> what's the best package to use for an ipod?
[05:10] <knix_> steelnub, go to #ubuntu-effects
[05:10] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ: which file do i need to edit ? im new to ubuntu
[05:10] <jessid> !kernel
[05:10] <steelnub> Thanks.
[05:10] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[05:10] <lisapc> !installing grub
[05:10] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about installing grub - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:10] <taggie> steelnub, go to #ubuntu-effects
[05:10] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces
[05:10] <Flannel> stiv2k: That package doesn't exist in edgy, you'll have to just use the old method
[05:10] <ricardo> in feisty the soon nvidia one appears in boot?
[05:10] <steelnub> thx again
[05:10] <RAOF> rellik_: By running "lsb_release --release" - It should return "6.06"
[05:10] <taggie> sorry knix, i'm too slow :)
[05:10] <NemesisD> anyone know how to switch between beryl and compiz?
[05:10] <Pelo> lisapc,   as a general rule I beleive you need to have grub install to which ever the boot drive is,  there woudn't be much point in having it install on another drive
[05:10] <kondor101> lisapc, but i have been using it for a week or so, and i think ive used terminal once in that time, thats a good sign
[05:11] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: it might look like this: auto eth0
[05:11] <PresuntoRJ> iface eth0 inet dhcp
[05:11] <slyfox> Help. I have a 2nd hard drive which is formatted to ext3 as one big partition. Ubuntu does not mount it automatically for some reason. A sudo user always has to do this? How do I permanantly mount this hard drive so that other users can use it every time the computert starts.
[05:11] <Pelo> kondor101,  you're not trying hard enough
[05:11] <knix_> taggie, no prob, :)
[05:11] <Antioch> Are there any drawbacks to using the 64-bit version of Ubuntu as opposed to the 32-bit version?
[05:11] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: put a # before the eth0 portion
[05:11] <SuperLag> slyfox: /etc/fstab
[05:11] <knix_> !update-manager-core
[05:11] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: create new lines like this:
[05:11] <mbpubuntu> steelnub: #ubuntu-effects
[05:11] <kondor101> Pelo, lol, maybe they are making it too easy
[05:11] <Pelo> slyfox,   edit fstab and add your second drive to it
[05:11] <rellik_> RAOF, ah, thanks..  one last question..  is there a non-gui version of update-manager?  I'm doing this over SSH
[05:11] <RAOF> Antioch: There's no 64bit flash player.  That's about it.
[05:11] <wooden719> Wireless problem:  I just installed feisty on a dell x300 with a truemobile 1400 broadcom card.  I had hoped fiesty would just work to connect to wireless connections, but it's not.  The network config sees the device and I can configure it (or try at least), but it won't connect to any networks.  The System Monitor does correctly identify the card.  um... any help?  What info can I give you?
[05:11] <lisapc> Pelo, you are dead wrong!  during POST, I press ESC and it gives me option to boot directly from first OR second hdd.  And I had edgy boot from 2nd HDD before.  So even if I took out my 1st hdd, I could still boot Ubuntu from 2nd hdd
[05:12] <Frog29> Pelo - thanks for the help - i'll go post this on the forums - it works since grub did not get updated to have the most recent GRUB version
=== doc| is now known as docMuerto
[05:12] <RAOF> rellik_: I don't think so.  Also, trying to upgrade your stuff over SSH is a recipie for misery :)
[05:12] <Dekkard> rellik_,
[05:12] <Dekkard>  sudo apt-get update
[05:12] <eric> hi. can someone tell me, where to find the grub settings? is there even a gui or should i edit the grub files?
[05:12] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: iface eth0 inet static
[05:12] <Antioch> RAOF cant you use the 32-bit version on the 64-bit system? I thought tehre was backwards compatibility
[05:12] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: address 172.17.1.220
[05:12] <slyfox> SuperLag: please tell me how exactly an entry for /dev/hdb/ and mount point /media/disk-1    should look like ?   it is an internal 2nd hard drive formatted to ext3 as one partition
[05:12] <rellik_> RAOF, I have remote console access, in case SSH fails
[05:12] <mbpubuntu> where's the best place to ask about ubuntu on intel macs?
[05:12] <lisapc> Pelo, and thats a great idea in case of first hdd failure. this way I can still boot Ubuntu from 2nd hdd!  THINK before you speak ;)
[05:12] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n:  netmask 255.255.255.0
[05:12] <SuperLag> I'm getting the iso downloaded faster than the mirrors can do update... Can you upgrade from the CD? or is apt the only way to do it?
[05:12] <stiv2k> Flannel: what? thats ridiculous
[05:12] <kondor101> eric, try typing grub into package manager
[05:12] <PresuntoRJ> network 172.17.1.0
[05:12] <Frog29> eric - if you press escape at some point during start up (near the beggning) ou can get to the grub menu
[05:12] <RAOF> rellik_: You mean, you can go an physically get to the machine?
[05:12] <arnold-8891> Wireless problem in Feisty: For some reason, after upgrading, I am not finding any indication anywhere of the existence of a PCI wireless card I have installed in my desktop. Does anyone know how I could fix this?
[05:13] <NemesisD> RAOF, i have the beryl manager installed but i believe that compiz is activated, how would i go about switching back/forth
[05:13] <PresuntoRJ> broadcast 172.17.1.255
[05:13] <stiv2k> Flannel: they specifically tell you to install that package to upgrade FROM edgy
[05:13] <SuperLag> slyfox: let's take this to  a /msg window
[05:13] <PresuntoRJ>  dns-nameservers 172.17.1.2
[05:13] <Awperator> Hello I have a wine question if someone can help me please. - How do I increase my 'C' disk drive size in wine? Thanks
[05:13] <taggie> rellik_: apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade
[05:13] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: gateway 172.17.1.254
[05:13] <Frog29> eric - from there you can select the correct ubuntu version and say e while it is highlighted.. then you can edit the settings temporarily.....
[05:13] <RAOF> NemesisD: By selecting Beryl from the beryl manager, or alternatively heading to #ubuntu-effects
[05:13] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: or what ever is your network settings
[05:13] <Flannel> stiv2k: right.  Uh, except... I see a bug report of someone who has used that.  Does typing "update" and hitting tab twice, give you anything?
[05:13] <Ademan> anyone know if theres a sort of "irc bot platform" out there?
[05:13] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: did you get it?
[05:13] <Dekkard> Awperator,  that question may be answered better in a wine channel
[05:13] <RAOF> Antioch: Yes, you can use the 32bit flashplayer, but you'll need a 32bit firefox, etc.  Basically, it's a bit more hassle.
[05:13] <ryanakca> it's sudo dpkg --force-remove-essential foobar      , right? (to remove an essential package) ... DISCLAIMER - use of force option can seriously damage your installation.
[05:13] <kondor101> 1294 users lol
[05:13] <Frog29> eric - press boot from there to boot using those settings.... if that's not what you needed you can also find the file under boot/grub/menu.lst
[05:13] <rellik_> RAOF, no I don't have physical access to the machine. but the hosting provider provides remote console access, in case you mess up your firewall or lock yourself out someone..  it's an AJAX terminal
[05:13] <phos-phoros> when attempting to launch ut2004 within feisty, I get the error "Error: Could not get dma buffer... exiting", any help in resolving this would be greatly appreciated.
[05:14] <gr3ml1n> yes i did that
[05:14] <Frog29> eric - i meant press b
[05:14] <j00p> what is the official link to download the cd image??
[05:14] <ubuntu543217> is it possible to install stuff on the liveCD? say, for example restricted drivers?
[05:14] <gr3ml1n> even though i set it to static with gnome network manager, the cfg says dhcp
[05:14] <gr3ml1n> seems to be buggy
[05:14] <kondor101> j00p, you want torrents?
[05:14] <kondor101> !torrents
[05:14] <ubotu> Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[05:14] <eric> Frog29, i think i just gonna edit the menu.lst.
[05:14] <RAOF> rellik_: What about if your Dapper->Edgy or Edgy->Feisty upgrade results in your network connection being broken?
[05:14] <SuperLag> slyfox: you paying attention? :)
[05:15] <lisapc> Pelo, LOL
[05:15] <eric> Frog29: thx
[05:15] <Frog29> eric - welcome :)
[05:15] <stiv2k> Flannel: no
[05:15] <boomhowza> whats the ubuntu help channal
[05:15] <Pelo> lisapc,  easy fix and it solves your problem
[05:15] <gr3ml1n> PresuntoRJ: how do i restart eth0 with the new settings?
[05:15] <lisapc> Pelo, what fix?
[05:15] <kondor101> now im seeding,  now im giving back :)))
[05:15] <Pelo> boomhowza,  this is it
[05:15] <Flannel> boomhowza: this is it
[05:15] <rellik_> RAOF, the remote console doesn't rely on the host's internet connection..  the remote console sits on a seperate server, and connects as a terminal.  just like a console
[05:15] <lisapc> Pelo, u gave no fix
[05:15] <arraista> i am trying to install feisty here and got stuck in the "scanning the mirror" phase. anyone experiencing the same problem? I see the servers are a little busy, but it's been at lease 30 minutes since it got to this mirror thing
[05:15] <whonicca> anyone on fesity right now?
[05:15] <Pelo> lisapc,  unplug the first hdd and install grub
[05:15] <RAOF> rellik_: Oooh, cool.
[05:15] <wooden719> Is there a channel for network/wireless problems?
[05:15] <rellik_> RAOF, yeah it's very nice
[05:16] <lisapc> Pelo, ROFL!  think before you speak man
[05:16] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: open a terminal
[05:16] <kondor101> whonicca, i have been using it about a week
[05:16] <lisapc> Pelo, think, deeply, think
[05:16] <Pelo> lisapc,  I do nothing but
[05:16] <wooden719> whonicca:  i am
[05:16] <Flannel> stiv2k: right.  Well, heres the bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/107891 we'll see how it goes.
[05:16] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[05:16] <RAOF> rellik_: I don't *think* there's a CLI version of the update-manager, but you could just use X forwarding?
[05:16] <whonicca> are u guys using ur own wallpapers, if so try to tile them, does it work?
[05:16] <kofwang>  Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxxxxx-xxx-xx-xxxx dose not exist, Dropping to a shell!!
[05:16] <lisapc> Pelo, you think, but you dont reason the thoughts, hence the reason your words are not coherent
[05:16] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: verify if it started propperly with: sudo ip add
[05:16] <kondor101> ill have a look
[05:16] <DPic> I need some help. I just created a partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear?
[05:16] <kofwang> what's wrong with me?
[05:16] <whonicca> im only able to mess around with the settings for default ubuntu wallpapers
[05:16] <stiv2k> Flannel: i'm curious to see how stable feisty is if i can't even upgrade to it without running into bugs
[05:16] <Pelo> I don'T like that guy
[05:16] <American-Tech_> Whew got my ATI card in! Ok now to see if I can get beryl in
[05:17] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: or with: ifconfig
[05:17] <rellik_> RAOF, yeah, I will try x-forwarding..  not ideal but ok :)
[05:17] <arooni> how damn!  what do yo ufolks think of fesity?
[05:17] <plewis77_>  wooden719: download the windows wireless drivers. Then follow the directions to install. Make sure you have the Windows drivers. Here is a howto I used http://www.net4nowtforum.co.uk/showthread.php?p=291060
[05:17] <disinterested> i had a good mirror but it keeps going slower and slower
[05:17] <slyfox> SuperLag: are my messages not getting to you ?
[05:17] <arooni> feisty?
[05:17] <chino> which init cna i switch to to get out of x11 mode ? i just wna tto go into multi user mode os i can confugre the box from ssh anyone know which innit ?
[05:17] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: then, try to navigate
[05:17] <arooni> should i upgrade now... or wait in a bit?
[05:17] <stiv2k> Flannel: so how else do i upgrade?
[05:17] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: did it work?
[05:17] <Flannel> stiv2k: eh, it was a miscommunication.  The people who put that on the webpage were going from one set of info (that it was there), and it mightve been yanked due to some issues
[05:17] <DPic> I need some help. I just created a partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear so that i can use it?
[05:17] <eric> Frog29, it won't let me edit the file. i think only root can..
[05:17] <Flannel> stiv2k: Bottom of that page has instructions, basically just change your sources.list and dist-upgrade
[05:17] <SuperLag> slyfox: are you registered to nickserv?
[05:17] <wasabi__> chino: Debian based distros don't use a seperate init mode for X.
[05:17] <wasabi__> chino: So the answer is, stop GDM.
[05:17] <stiv2k> Flannel: is it safe to do that?
[05:18] <chino> wasabi__: how ?
[05:18] <slyfox> SuperLag: no, I do not know how
[05:18] <chino> im using kubuntu
[05:18] <whonicca> kondor101, wooden719, does it work?
[05:18] <j00p> can i overwrite my actual ubuntu files to replace by feisty with the live cd ?
[05:18] <wasabi__> chino: /etc/init.d/gdm stop
[05:18] <American-Tech_> How do I install beryl?
[05:18] <chino> wtf... why dont you have a none desktop mode
[05:18] <chino> ok
[05:18] <kondor101> whonicca, yes the tile effect works
[05:18] <Flannel> stiv2k: of course.  All update-manager stuff does is make sure oyu have the proper metapackages.  ubuntu-minial and ubuntu-standard and stuff
[05:18] <stiv2k> Flannel: they say on the page its less reliable
[05:18] <Awperator> Can anyone please answer my wine question? No one seems to be in the wine channel. Pm me if you can. Thanks :)
[05:18] <Awperator> shoudl be pretty simple i think
[05:18] <whonicca> kondor101: are u using ur own custom wallpaper?
[05:18] <Pelo> Awperator,  ask
[05:18] <MonKi> hello
[05:18] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: remember to check what is in the /etc/resolv.conf file (should be your dns servers)
[05:18] <boomhowza> i cant boot up the cd to instal...
[05:18] <DPic> Hello? I just created a partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear so that i can use it?
[05:18] <gr3ml1n_> thx it worked
[05:19] <Pelo> boomhowza,   borked cd,  defective drive ,  or you might want to try the atlernate install cd
[05:19] <wooden719> plewis77, thanks.  i'll try it.  thought i wouldn't need to with feisy though...  <trotts off>
[05:19] <kondor101> whonicca, i downloaded a small image (the ubuntu symbol off distro watch) set it as background, it stretched, i changed it to tiled, it tiled
[05:19] <American-Tech_> Any how to out there to install beryl?
[05:19] <PresuntoRJ> gr3ml1n: dhcp and gnome-network-manager sets it, but you might need to handle yourself while manully editing the files
[05:19] <RAOF> Flannel, stiv2k: Actually, upgrade-manager does more than just install meta-packages.  It also does some config changes to make Feisty *work* (such as looking at /etc/fstab, and making sure it'll survive the hda->sda rename, etc)
[05:19] <Dekkard> !beryl
[05:19] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects

[05:20] <whonicca> kondor101: yeah
[05:20] <dsl1053> ho no
[05:20] <Flannel> RAOF: the issue is that there's no update-manager-core
[05:20] <DPic> Can somebody please help me??? I just created a partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear so that i can use it?
[05:20] <boomhowza> pelo, the CDs fine, drive is fine, everything is fine, i just dont know how to make it boot the CD when i start
[05:20] <Stoffer> is there an easy way to set ubuntu to allow me to drag windows to other desktops/workspaces?
[05:20] <wasabi__> j00p: you can do anything with the LiveCD> It's a full distro.

[05:20] <Nerdz> What is the checksum for the desktop release 7.04 x86?

[05:20] <slyfox> SuperLag:
[05:20] <gr3ml1n_> PresuntoRJ: it worked now
[05:20] <wooden719> whonnica, it worked for me, too
[05:20] <slyfox> SuperLag:  I know it should start as
[05:20] <slyfox>  /dev/hdb1 /media/disk-1
[05:20] <slyfox>  in my fstab
[05:20] <slyfox>  but what do I write after that ?
[05:20] <RAOF> stiv2k: Well, it's *less* safe than using upgrade-manager.  But as long as you're confident fixing the (potential) problems, there'

[05:20] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: are you sure you WLAN card was propperly detected and set by the system
[05:20] <kondor101> whonicca, obviously it cant tile full screen images, just small ones
[05:20] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - i'm not sure....
[05:20] <Frog29> but i see it
[05:20] <RAOF> stiv2k: there's nothing wrong with the "edgy"->"feisty" in sources.list route
[05:20] <Pelo> boomhowza,  ah,    enter the bios and change the order of your boot devices, or try hitting f8 at boot time, some compubers will give you a little menu
[05:20] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: linuxes in general may have a tough time detecting cards with windows-only drivers

[05:21] <j00p> ok thanks just another question.. what goes the best to write a cd image on a cd with ubuntu?
[05:21] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: try this
[05:21] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: open a terminal
[05:21] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - aka i see it under network settings
[05:21] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: lspci
[05:21] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: what have it echoed?

[05:22] <boomhowza> pelo, do you select CD:ROM or USB CD:ROM
[05:22] <whonicca> kondor101: i was able to do it b4, i cant even scale them,
[05:22] <nowisn> hmmm i used super grub cd to try to reinstall grub for ubuntu but i decided to fix the windows mbr instead and now it says error loading operating system
[05:22] <whonicca> kondor101: http://www.zshare.net/image/screenshot-png-hf0.html
[05:22] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: it knows about it, but it might not know what to do with it
[05:22] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - it is a compaq though... but i tihnk broadcom has the ame car typie in dells
[05:22] <arooni> should i upgrade now... or wait in a bit?
[05:22] <Pelo> boomhowza,   is depends which you put the live cd in
[05:22] <arooni> to feisty
[05:22] <Pelo> boomhowza,  try each
[05:22] <Stoffer> and what's the program that records keyboard/mouse strokes?  Can I use that identifier in "keyboard shortcuts" to move between workspaces?
[05:22] <boomhowza> kk
[05:22] <nowisn> the disk said it couldn't locate linux
[05:22] <jessai> hola
[05:22] <sfsza> I deleted the xorg.conf file on Feisty without making a backup. What can I use to regenerate it? I used to know this but haven't used Debian in a long time.
[05:22] <whonicca> kondor101: notice how it says the pic is 128x80 pixels, its really 1680x1050
[05:22] <fulat2k> how can i get the Restricted Devices Manager in Kubuntu?
[05:22] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: can you find a network icon near the clock (top to the right)?
[05:22] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - i was unable to get it workign i nthe last version..... but i know it see's it under netowrk settings and i have set up a nework connection info thing ( the name pass ,etc.)
[05:23] <ajax4> Hey guys...just installed 7.04 and it says there are updates. "update-manager" and "update-manager-core" but now its warning me that they are "not authenticated". What's up with that?
[05:23] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - yes
[05:23] <dsl1053> Np
[05:23] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: me neither, but the Feisty now knows how to use my linksys wlan
[05:23] <dsl1053> <B
[05:23] <RAOF> fulat2k: You can't, sucks to be not runnign Gnome :(
[05:23] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: maybe it works for you too
[05:23] <Dekkard> ajax4,  they aren't official
[05:23] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: right click it
[05:23] <fulat2k> RAOF: ughh......  any alternatives then?
[05:23] <ajax4> Dekkard: Should I install them?
[05:23] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - i tihnk it just isn't running it......
[05:24] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: does it show a wireless option (most likely disabled)
[05:24] <fulat2k> RAOF: besides reading binarydriverhowto/nvidia that is :)
[05:24] <Dekkard> ive installed unauthenitcated packages with no problem.. your milage may vary'
[05:24] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - i have a name of eth1 as disconnected
[05:24] <sfsza> Those are safe, I think
[05:24] <RAOF> fulat2k: Not really.  Although nVidia is easy to install: "sudo aptitude install linux-generic nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals", followed by a restart.
[05:24] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: it might be your cable connection
[05:25] <sfsza> I don't know why Ubuntu doesn't include GPG keys of some the default repos in Feisty, but I'm sure you could hunt them down if you're very concerned about it, ajax4
[05:25] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - it shows a wireless connection but it says disconnected.. i know it is my wireless
[05:25] <csmanx> uhmm... according the help menus if I enter "rescue" the Ubuntu DVD should load a rescue mode kernel
[05:25] <ajax4> sfsza: It's just strange that it just came out and we're getting these errors.
[05:25] <csmanx> I can't get there =(
[05:25] <Keldoor> how can i see .wine directory in my file browser..(Nautilus)..  (dot)files seem to be hidden??
[05:25] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: try to enable it, and set up to your wifi options
[05:25] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: WEP, WPA, what ever
[05:26] <RAOF> Keldoor: Ctrl+H, or "show hidden files"
[05:26] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: does it start?
[05:26] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - how would i enable it?
[05:26] <wastrel> Keldoor:  "dotfiles" are hidden normally in linux
[05:26] <sfsza> ajax4, it's ok, I got the same. Everything I've tried to install has given me that error, in fact. Apt does it when it doesn't have the keys to check signatures, etc.
[05:26] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: click on the "Wireless" when you right click the icon
[05:26] <fulat2k> RAOF: cool, thx.  will try it when i get back
[05:26] <sfsza> I don't think I've ever had a signature fail but I'd reckon it says something different when that happens :S
[05:26] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: does it start?
[05:26] <Keldoor> Raof... i checked the show hidden but it don't show... do u have to restart the browsser ... or somthing else
[05:26] <Dekkard> i just installed scribus.. its an unauthenticated package.. works fine
[05:27] <linuxgx> What is the IRC for WINE?
[05:27] <ajax4> sfsza: Thanks. I'll try to find the keys later, until then its just a minor annoyance.
[05:27] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - one sec... i lost the wireless settings
[05:27] <cables> linuxgx: #wine
[05:27] <RAOF> Keldoor: If you can see other dot-files in the browser, then the .wine directory doesn't exist.
[05:27] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: ok
[05:27] <RAOF> linuxgx: #winehq
[05:27] <Keldoor> #winehq
[05:27] <cables> Is anyone able to get to the repos at all?
[05:27] <Nergar> how do i install beryl??
[05:27] <cables> linuxgx: sorry then, it's #winehq
[05:27] <crdlb> cables, I was by using a specific mirror

[05:27] <cables> crdlb: which mirror is that?
[05:27] <fulat2k> anyone here using a dlink dwl-g122 rev b1?  is it automatically detected in feisty?
[05:28] <crdlb> cables, I used kernel.org, but I just picked on randomly

[05:29] <Nergar> i heard ntfs-3g was going to me included in feisty, but i can't write to my ntfs partition

[05:29] <hendaus> PresuntoRJ,  thanx, but i want to help me on ktorrent
[05:29] <jessai> hello
[05:30] <labanux> did feisty support HDA Intel sound card?
[05:30] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - i have network settings open and i am checking the box for wireless
[05:30] <ireland> hey...I need help finding partition info
[05:30] <Nerdz> My problem is: When I try to install ubuntu, I select the Start/Install menu, then I see the ubuntu logo with a progress bar at the bottom. When the progress bar reach the end, I see a black screen and then, I see a orange/yellow screen and I only have my mouse. I have waited 10minutes to this window and still nothing. What can I do to solve this? Thanks
[05:30] <ireland> parted won't see my disc
[05:30] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: I am not really familiar with ktorrent, but I have used it unde FreeBSD
[05:30] <MrMakeveli> hey guys
[05:30] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: what seemes to be the problems
[05:30] <RAOF> labanux: The answer to that is somewhere between "yes" and "no".  It supports *my* HDA Intel, but there are thousands of quirky HDA intel cards.
[05:30] <AzMoo> Hey, I'm just starting the upgrade to feisty and it's telling me that there's "no valid mirror". I'm using my ISP's mirror, which has 7.04 on there, last updated April 19th. Is it OK to continue?
[05:30] <MrMakeveli> the repos are having big troubles, yeah?
[05:30] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: ok, any progress on setting it up?
[05:30] <fishfillet> guys, anyone here has a link to a torrent for feisty?
[05:30] <labanux> it works, in edgy, but since I upgrade to feisty it can't make any sound
[05:30] <jessai> somebody wanna help me with beryl with ati???
[05:31] <hendaus> PresuntoRJ,  ihow can i creat a torrent movie and upload it on sharingcode website
[05:31] <mellow_bunny> !beryl
[05:31] <leroi_> what is a good bittorrent client to use, i am used to using utorrent in windows and i really like that
[05:31] <yell0w> hey folks, how can i resize the left server list in xchat ?
[05:31] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[05:31] <labanux> Nerdz : try using alternate install CD..
[05:31] <fishfillet> any torrent for feisty final?
[05:31] <JebJoya> umm, i killed my x window
[05:31] <Pelo> AzMoo,   the servers are a bit overwhelmed at the moment,  everybody and their goldfish is upgrading,  my suggestion wait a couple of days
[05:31] <compilerwriter> leroi_ ktorrent
[05:31] <labanux> Nerdz: ubuntu live CD is sucks..
[05:31] <JebJoya> :'S
[05:31] <RAOF> labanux: It'll probably be fixed by a kernel update sometime fairly soon.  crimsun was looking at all the hda-intel problems.
[05:31] <Dekkard> azureus.. or bittornado
[05:31] <ajax4> leroi_: Azureus is a very popular bittorent client also.
[05:31] <hendaus> PresuntoRJ,  i make new then creat but i dont know what to put on tracker
[05:31] <AzMoo> Pelo, That's why I want to use my ISP's mirror.
[05:31] <Dekkard> or ktorrent
[05:31] <SuperLag> So how many of you guys have Feisty Fawn installed already?
[05:31] <stiv2k> grr
[05:31] <leroi_> azureus is too much of a resource hog
[05:31] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: ok... so your problem seems to be on how to create a torrent, and not really with ktorrent (you could use other clients for that) :)
[05:31] <stiv2k> fsck archive.ubuntu.com
[05:32] <ajax4> SuperLag: Just installed it a few minutes ago.
[05:32] <ireland> anyone home?
[05:32] <Dekkard> leroi_,  but its reliable
[05:32] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: have you tried to download your own torrent?
[05:32] <Nerdz> labanux: so what should i do?
[05:32] <compilerwriter> amen leroi_
[05:32] <xq> So I installed Ubuntu and everything went smooth, partitioning etc. on the drive I wanted and then Grub has "Error 17" argh
[05:32] <jk-> hi ubunteros
[05:32] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - here'es the deal i have wireless connection enable with the newtowkr settings but under connection properties it has eth1 (or eth0) as disconnected
[05:32] <PresuntoRJ> hendaus: it should introduce yor torrent to the tracker
[05:32] <leroi_> i just wish utorrent would work without having to use wine
[05:32] <labanux> Nerdz : try using "alternate install" CD..
[05:32] <hendaus> PresuntoRJ,  i dont know how>? thats why i need anyone help me
[05:32] <MrMakeveli> hey will someone "MrMakeveli: hello" me or something so i can tell if it highlights it?
[05:32] <Pelo> AzMoo,  consider that your isp mirror might not be up to date yet
[05:32] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - both have 0 sent or recieved packets.....
[05:32] <SuperLag> ajax4: any comments? What's your initial impression?
[05:32] <Dekkard> man.. i am so glad i dodn't have to do this
[05:32] <jk-> anyone know how to list the installed packages from multiverse ?
[05:32] <Pelo> hello MrMakeveli
[05:32] <Nerdz> labanux: ok I'll try to find it
[05:33] <ireland> hellooooooo need help setting up vmware...any takers?
[05:33] <compilerwriter> mrmakeveli this should be higlighted
[05:33] <MrMakeveli> Pelo: that kinda worled
[05:33] <MrMakeveli> worked*
[05:33] <labanux> Nerdz :there's 3 version of ubuntu install cd : server, desktop, and alternate.., use alternate instead..

[05:33] <MrMakeveli> compilerwriter: are you on ex chat?
[05:33] <Pelo> ireland,   #vmware
[05:33] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: ok, are you connected from another equipment talkign to me or did it work via wireless... I am not sure if I follow
[05:33] <fishfillet> can someone please give me a torrent file to download ubuntu feisty?
[05:33] <SuperLag> ireland: there is a good tutorial on how to do that in the forums
[05:33] <wooden719> !beryl
[05:33] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[05:33] <JebJoya> umm, right, when i boot i get a load of errors about my gnome window manager - i tried to move to compiz using beryl while watching a video in vlc, it crashed so i ctrl-alt-backspaced, crashed out to command prompt, ctrl-alt-del'ed and... well, nothing's working... any suggestions?  using the alternate boot cd perhaps?
[05:33] <ajax4> SuperLag: Barely tried it out but it looks good. I just noticed a "Restricted Drivers Manager" that comes with it that installs my Nvidia drivers automatically.
[05:33] <SuperLag> ajax4: nice
[05:33] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - I have my desktop computer to talk to you (my laptop with ubuntu is next to me)
[05:33] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: ok
[05:34] <ireland> yeah...I've got tutorial I think....
[05:34] <wooden719> !bcm43xx-fwcutter
[05:34] <compilerwriter> I am on whatever Konversation is a front end.  mrmakeveli
[05:34] <labanux> Nerdz :if you go to ubuntu website, in download section, see the check box below telling about RAM less than 256.., check this.., then you'll get the alternate cd *i guess..
[05:34] <mbpubuntu> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook is wrong about feisty in several respects.  where do i ask about this?
[05:34] <ireland> ...but I'm trying to read partitions with parted...can't get it sorted out
[05:34] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: what does it show if you open a Terminal and type: ip add
[05:34] <SuperLag> ajax4: did it give you the option to upgrade, from the CD? or did you upgrade from synaptic?
[05:34] <draeath> Quick question: does feisty still have the issue with PS/2 keyboards not working after boot? (some jerkoff keeps putting in a patch to help support USB keyboards that breaks PS/2)
[05:34] <lisapc> Pelo, I figured it out!  was easy.  I simply removed grub from 1st HDD, and then "sudo grub-install /dev/sdb" which installs it on my 2nd HDD.  I now dont even need the 1st HDD to load Ubuntu. :)
[05:34] <Nerdz> labanux: I have to chek the box :"Check here if you need the alternate desktop cd suited for computers with less than 256MB of RAM"  Right?
[05:34] <MrMakeveli> compilerwriter: i kind of like how konversation looks
[05:34] <tbodine> The latest beta of Feisty should be going through updates since the release, correct?
[05:34] <ajax4> SuperLag: My next step will be to get XGL and compiz/beryl going...hopefully it will go better than when I tried it under Dapper.
[05:34] <MrMakeveli> is anyone on the gnome exchat?
[05:34] <ajax4> SuperLag: I did a clean install, though there were options to upgrade from CD also.
[05:35] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - a lot
[05:35] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: I have lo (for localhost) eth0 (for wired) wlan0 (wifi) and sit0
[05:35] <mellow_bunny> Nerdz: yes
[05:35] <MrMakeveli> i was on xchat before i upgraded, now it looks all fresh an whathave you
[05:35] <lisapc> Pelo, make a note of what I did for your future refence
[05:35] <Nerdz> Thanks
[05:35] <compilerwriter> konversation is a really nice suite if you are a power user mrmakeveli.
[05:35] <labanux> Nerdz :yes.., but if you're not sure, just go here http://kambing.ui.edu/tuma/Ubuntu/Feisty/ there's alternate cd right there
[05:35] <SuperLag> ajax4: sweet. I got a decent connection to a mirror, and I'm about 25% into the download
[05:35] <JebJoya> umm, right, when i boot i get a load of errors about my gnome window manager - i tried to move to compiz using beryl while watching a video in vlc, it crashed so i ctrl-alt-backspaced, crashed out to command prompt, ctrl-alt-del'ed and... well, nothing's working... any suggestions?  using the alternate boot cd perhaps?
[05:35] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - 3 connection.... 1 loopback, one eth0 as nocarrier broadcast and up, the other eth1 as broadcast and multicast
[05:35] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: each one must have its own IP address to work, wich means, it found the network and its DHCP, and therefore it is working
[05:35] <MrMakeveli> i wish that it would highlight convos in red the way xchat would. now im on the gnome xchat and it just beeps
[05:35] <yeniklasor> hi, if I upgrade all my programs will remove? is it a format?
[05:36] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: no IP... no good
[05:36] <Flannel> yeniklasor: no
[05:36] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: hum... let me think
[05:36] <ajax4> SuperLag: Are you using bittorrent?
[05:36] <Vaske_Car> Any fast FTP to download 7.04?
[05:36] <xechostor> is there an install dvd available for fiest? cant find one, only the cd
[05:36] <SuperLag> ajax4: no, just a straight wget from a mirror
[05:36] <MrMakeveli> im going to try something out "MrMakeveli"
[05:36] <SuperLag> ajax4: IndianaU
[05:36] <MrMakeveli> hmm i dont think that worked
[05:36] <Siph0n> does the server edition not come with a gui already installed?
[05:36] <yeniklasor> Frannel : is it like a core upgrade?
[05:36] <Frog29> presuntoRJ - i know eth1 is my wireless since it has an extra bar at the bottom saying signal strenth( its empty)
[05:36] <labanux> RAOF : you're HDA Intel soundcard works doesn't it? but, what kind of upgrade method do you use? fresh install or upgrade with apt?
[05:36] <mellow_bunny> Siph0n: no
[05:36] <wastrel> Siph0n:  no
[05:36] <MrMakeveli> will someone use "MrMakeveli" in a sentence to see if it highlights?
[05:36] <wastrel> MrMakeveli:  no
[05:37] <JebJoya> MrMakeveli: heh
[05:37] <MrMakeveli> wastrel: hmm didnt work
[05:37] <mellow_bunny> haha
[05:37] <compilerwriter> mrmakeveli yes
[05:37] <Flannel> yeniklasor: it'll upgrade everything
[05:37] <ap1> I got sudo garbled. I tried to apt-get remove/install it (recovery boot) but accidentally deleted a couple of dependent packages. I don't see anything in the logs. Does apt log somewhere a list of removed pkgs so I can re-install them?
[05:37] <wooden719> frog29, what's your wireless card type? broadcom? integrated?
[05:37] <Flannel> ap1: dpkg keeps logs
[05:37] <labanux> Vaske_Car : select mirror closest to your home.. :)
[05:37] <lisapc> Pelo, Grub and everything is on my 2nd external HDD now
[05:37] <roller> xechostor: no dvd yet
[05:37] <Frog29> wooden719 integrated on a ompaq laptop
[05:37] <yeniklasor> my files and my installed 3 rd programs won't delete yeah?
[05:37] <jooby> hey weird problem here - can't get nm-manager applet to display
[05:37] <Flannel> ap1: but, just reinstallling sudo should reinstall the dependencies

[05:37] <labanux> !alsa
[05:37] <xechostor> roller : thanks :)
[05:37] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[05:38] <Pelo> lisapc,   good for you,  I am in awe of your 1337ness
[05:38] <Frog29> wooden719 ubuntu recognizes the card and something that seems to be just like it
[05:38] <RAOF> labanux: My card works, yes.  But I've been running Feisty since before Christmas.  The upgrade method shouldn't affect it, though.
[05:38] <Nerdz> What's the difference between live CD and alternate?
[05:38] <wooden719> frog29, i'm seeing the same thing you're seeing
[05:38] <compilerwriter> vaske_car then cross yourself, light a cigar and drink some congac this might take a while.
[05:38] <lisapc> Pelo, and I am in awe of your ignorance :)
[05:38] <ajax4> SuperLag: Restarting my system now....will soon find out if the Nvidia drivers installed correctly.
[05:38] <roller> Nerds: the alternate installs in text mode
[05:38] <ceil420> "Opera for *nix sucks."
[05:38] <Pelo> what a  *******
[05:38] <ceil420> "No one should be forced to use anything that uses Qt."
[05:38] <yeniklasor> Flannel : my files and my installed 3 rd programs won't delete yeah?
[05:38] <ceil420> what's Qt and why is it bad?
[05:38] <labanux> crimsun : cannot open `/proc/asound/oss/sndstat' for reading: No such file or directory
[05:38] <SuperLag> ajax4: excellent
[05:38] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29:  what do you get when on the Terminal you borwse your hardware information on the System>Preferences>Hardware Information
[05:38] <Flannel> Nerdz: Alternate CD is textmode installer only (no liveCD), contains addiional install options (gui-less, OEM, etc), and has a package repository on it with additional packages
[05:38] <Nerdz> roller: ok Thanks
[05:39] <Flannel> yeniklasor: correct.  They'll just all be upgraded
[05:39] <yeniklasor> OK thanks
[05:39] <xechostor> one other question. Is audigy sound working properly out of the box, as they say? (integrated audigy SE here on a MSI K9N Diamond Mobo )
[05:39] <seamus7> Even though I chose the Alternate CD Upgrade ... it's still connecting to the network for updates ... which means I'm still experiencing a very slow upgrad process
[05:39] <crimsun> labanux: looks like alsa oss emulation modules aren't loaded.
[05:39] <jooby> anyone know why an applet refuses to display?
[05:39] <eureka> I'm trying to view an image , it's pointing to the right location, and the image was there, however I still got a broken image when viewing, another interesting thing is that I can't see the image through samba, but I can list it using ls. What's wrong?
[05:39] <wastrel> ceil420:  Qt is a graphics toolkit used to create a GUI.  it's not bad, some people dislike it- some people like it. it's an opinion thing.
[05:39] <roller> plus; lets you update from edgy and install in oem
[05:39] <labanux> crimsun: how can i fix this?
[05:39] <crimsun> labanux: please download and use the script linked from http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=support , then tell me the URL of the paste.

[05:40] <hendaus> Dekkard,  do u know how to creat a torrent file to upload it on a site?
[05:40] <ceil420> wastrel, ah. the person i quoted that from is the hardcore type. slackware and all.
[05:40] <ap1> Flannel, no, reinstalling sudo does not reinstall things that were dependent _on: sudo
[05:40] <labanux> crimsun: wait a minute..
[05:40] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - from research i had done earlier it seems as if the dell thing has the same driver
[05:40] <ceil420> thanks
[05:40] <wastrel> ceil420:  kde uses qt , gnome uses gtk.
[05:40] <Flannel> ap1: Ah.  Gotcha.  Yeah, check dpkg logs.
[05:40] <ceil420> oh, i see
[05:40] <ceil420> Xfce uses gtk too doesn't it?
[05:40] <wastrel> dunno from xfce
[05:41] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29:  same chipsete I guess... not really sure, it appears you are in a nimbo between heaven and hell, I mean, with and without wi fi
[05:41] <Flannel> ap1: but, uh, ubuntu-standard and ubuntu-minimal (and ubuntu-desktop) should (I think?) cover most of them.  If you cant get a list from your logs for whaever reason
[05:41] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: its detected and started but somehow it wont realy network
[05:41] <wooden719> frog29, fwiw mine is dell trumobile 1400
[05:41] <insmod> what does "export INTEL_BATCH"  do? on google they say  export INTEL_BATCH=1 boost performance i tried export INTEL_BATCH=4 and got better reuslts
[05:41] <vexati0n> quick! everybody stop downloading Feisty!
[05:41] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: I was like this on Edgy, but it worked under Feistty
[05:41] <tovella> working with limited internet service - no web browsing.  where can i ftp a feisty x86 desktop iso?
[05:41] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - i think i just need to tell it to start.... if i remember there is some command to tell it to but i triesd it a few weeks ago on 6.10
[05:42] <labanux> crimsun: it tells me to go to the #alsa room.. and see this : http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/scripts/output.txt
[05:42] <Flannel> ap1: ubuntu-minimal is dependant on sudo.  It appears thats the only one
[05:42] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: you could try to locate a similar bug report (if any) on http://launchpad.net regarding wifi with your card chipset
[05:42] <crimsun> labanux: yes, run the script. I helped develop that script.
[05:42] <letronje> to upgrade from edgy to fiesty, do i need to change my sources.list to the default one that edgy came with ?
[05:42] <burepe_> !feisty fawn
[05:42] <ubotu> FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[05:43] <burepe_> how do you upgrade?
[05:43] <lani> i am trying to install feisty, i get into live cd, but when i try to install it can't seem to load the install application
[05:43] <Flannel> !upgrade | burepe_
[05:43] <ubotu> burepe_: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[05:43] <Pelo> letronje,  I don'Tthink so,  you get a button to tedding you that 7.04 is available in the update manager
[05:43] <baklava-> anyone from .it around?
[05:43] <burepe_> tanks!
[05:43] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - hmmm
[05:44] <bobbob1016> Hi all, I have what I think is a simple question.  If I reinstall Feisty on my PC, and I already have different partitions for my home, and my /, will I lose any of my settings?
[05:44] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: do you know how to?
[05:44] <mellow_bunny> bobbob1016: not if you map corectly
[05:44] <RAOF> bobbob1016: Some, kinda.
[05:44] <letronje> Pelo: yes i do , but it seems the in.archive.ubuntu.com is not responding, so installation is not proceeding firther
[05:44] <eobanb> bobbob1016, if you have different partitions, but only format the partitions that do not contain your home, etc, then you will not lose settings.
[05:44] <RAOF> bobbob1016: As long as you don't format your /home, you won't lose your personal settings.
[05:44] <eobanb> bobbob1016, you must be sure to specify those partitions for your /home, etc, when installing
[05:44] <RAOF> bobbob1016: Anything in /etc/ will be lost, though.
[05:44] <eobanb> just dont overwrite them
[05:44] <mellow_bunny> etc holds system settings
[05:44] <bobbob1016> I wasn't sure about my beryl settings
[05:44] <Pelo> letronje,   servers are very busy atm
[05:44] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - do what?
[05:45] <eobanb> bobbob1016, why are you reinstalling?
[05:45] <bobbob1016> I know not to format my home partition, I just wasn't sure what gets lost
[05:45] <billy> need a quick hint.  "./configure && make && make install" to install tar.gz?
[05:45] <brian|lfs> is everyone having pro0blems using automatix tongiht
[05:45] <brian|lfs> tonight
[05:45] <Flannel> !automatix | brian|lfs
[05:45] <ubotu> brian|lfs: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe
[05:45] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - huh if i say ifconfig it only shows eth0 and lo
[05:45] <brian|lfs> Iya and the mirros are slow
[05:45] <Pelo> billy,  sudo make install,  but read the readme / install files in the tr.gz first    there might be an installer
[05:45] <letronje> Pelo: ok thnx, so keeping additional repositories in sources.list wont break the upgrade right?
[05:46] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: you could try to locate a similar bug report at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/ searching for a similar bug report some one might have posted (regarding your chipset)
[05:46] <Flannel> brian|lfs: Don't use automatix.  simple as that.  It's nothing *but* problems
[05:46] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - using -a it shows eth1
[05:46] <bobbob1016> eobanb, I had Edgy with Beryl on XGL working fine, and now my XGL session doesn't work, and I tried removing the XGL session, and going AIGLX as someone recommended, and for some reason I can't boot without the ATI drivers installed
[05:46] <brian|lfs> huh lol
[05:46] <zilly6_> anyone know how to make a bootable usb drive?
[05:46] <brian|lfs> I've always used it never had a problem
[05:46] <RAOF> billy: Also, make *sure* that you're not trying to install something that's in the repositories already.
[05:46] <Pelo> letronje,  as far as I know ( and I havewn't upgraded yet) the third party repos get disabled during the upgrade
[05:46] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - k
[05:46] <bobbob1016> eobanb, and my sound doesn't work
[05:46] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: hum... it means it did not start the other
[05:46] <Flannel> !worksforme | brian|lfs
[05:46] <RAOF> brian|lfs: See !worksforme :P
[05:46] <labanux> crimsun: i've ran the script, it returned error like this : cat: /proc/asound/version: No such file or directory, and so on..
[05:46] <ubotu> brian|lfs: Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[05:46] <crimsun> bobbob1016: tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat
[05:46] <albert> i have two questions: i installed the textbased alternate of ubuntu and everytime i install software, which ist available on the cd too, the system asks me to instert the cd. is there a way of activating "download everything"?
[05:46] <letronje> Pelo: cool, thnx once again,bye
[05:46] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - so how would i just tell it to start?
[05:46] <billy> RAOF, I'm sure.
[05:46] <Flannel> albert: Go to your software properties, and uncheck the CD
[05:47] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - i thinkl the problem is it just has never been told to start
[05:47] <albert> the second: do i need du edit my sources.list like in edgy?
[05:47] <crimsun> labanux: ok, now pastebin `lspci -v && lspci -vvn && cat /proc/interrupts`
[05:47] <crimsun> labanux: be sure to tell me the URL of the paste
[05:47] <eobanb> bobbob1016, you cant boot, or you cant start X
[05:47] <billy> Pelo, thanks.  will do.
[05:47] <brian|lfs> I thought you where a bot Ubuntu
[05:47] <RAOF> billy: Ok.  It's just that it's *much, much* easier to use apt instead :)
[05:47] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: locating the bug... there is an Advanced Search item there... use direct key words
[05:47] <Pelo> albert,  open up sources manager and uncheck the cd
[05:47] <brian|lfs> UBOTU i MEAN
[05:47] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about i mean - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:47] <Flannel> albert: edit your sources.list to comment out the CD (with #).  Do you mean edit it to upgrade to feisty?  No.
[05:47] <bobbob1016> eobanb, can't start x, I've done reconfigure xserver
[05:47] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: wifi dell connection
[05:47] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: your chipset number
[05:47] <ap1> Is Wiki "RestrictedFormats" the best way to install support for mp3 & such (in Edgy)?
[05:47] <tarelerulz> When I rum movies in Gxine I don't get any sound is the command problem?
[05:47] <labanux> crimsun: oh sorry.., i forget to tell the URL of pastebin.. :D
[05:47] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: !bug
[05:47] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - k, but on the side doing sudo ifconfig eth1 up gives a no such file or directory, but i know it works
[05:47] <Flannel> ap1: yes

[05:49] <albert> flannel: k, is there some guide which parts of the sources.list to edit, to get full software access?
[05:49] <Kickboy> I need some assistance with my 6.10 to 7.04 upgrade. I tried doing the upgrade through the update manager, but it was taking waaay too long. So I stopped it, and downloaded the "Alternate CD" to do it from there (Since BitTorrent is faster, it took only 20 minutes to DL). Well, now because I stopped the first upgrade ALL of my packwages are no longer authenticated, making it completely impossible for me to upgrade.
[05:49] <Kickboy> any ideas?

[05:49] <DanaG> my gnomevfs is broken for ssh.
[05:49] <crimsun> bobbob1016: I need the actual output...
[05:50] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - the first didn't work... the second is running now
[05:50] <insmod> anyone know a fix for usplash on laptops
[05:50] <bobbob1016> crimsun, Mixers:       0: Realtek ALC880
[05:50] <RAOF> insmod: Not without a description of the problem.  Usplash works on *my* laptop
[05:50] <crimsun> bobbob1016: ok.
[05:51] <ap1> How do I highlight a keyword in Gaim/IRC?
[05:51] <bobbob1016> crimsun, totem still doesn't play sound, the sound pref does the beep though
[05:51] <insmod> RAOF: i won't do a full shutdown on some laptops
[05:51] <ap1> Why does loadkeys not find fi-latin1 keymap in console?
[05:51] <insmod> it
[05:51] <labanux> crimsun : this is the output : http://pastebin.ca/449300
[05:51] <tarelerulz> So any one else have gxine not have sound for movies?
[05:51] <DanaG> Another odd thing:
[05:51] <DanaG> XFCE breaks my keyboard.
[05:51] <Tarkus> hey im wondering whats the difference between XGL, Compiz, and Beryl. anyone care to explain? thanks guys.
[05:52] <Flannel> Tarkus: #ubuntu-effects might be the best place to ask
[05:52] <brian|lfs> oh
[05:52] <DanaG> My arrow keys and home-pgup-pgdn-end turn into Japanese Input Method keys.
[05:52] <RAOF> insmod: Ah, so it's probably not actually a usplash bug, then.  Your laptop doesn't shut down properly?
[05:52] <Tarkus> Flannel: k, thanks
[05:52] <[ithaycu] > for some reason occasionally have to reboot before I can rip a DVD
[05:52] <DanaG> Odd: when I shut down, usplash doesn't show.
[05:52] <Nergar> so what else should i install????
[05:52] <Kickersny> my install is hung at 82% ("Scanning the mirror...")
[05:52] <Kickersny> what's it doing? waiting on the server?
[05:52] <Nergar> maybe
[05:52] <crimsun> labanux: ok, looking.
[05:52] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - i keep on seeing the phrase network is down in refernce to eht1
[05:52] <insmod> RAOF: all the forums say it's usplash
[05:52] <Nergar> servers are full
[05:52] <bobbob1016> crimsun, still no sound from anything but the sound pref's
[05:53] <zero88> what advantages are they to compiling your own kenel.or reompiling?
[05:53] <insmod> RAOF: works without usplash
[05:53] <Kickersny> Nergar, ahh, it just advanced and it's now downloading the package lists
[05:53] <SuperLag> ajax4: What's the verdict?
[05:53] <camer0ff> i need to download a website to a certain number of levels.. do i use wget?
[05:53] <crimsun> bobbob1016: are they all set to ALSA (for sink)?
[05:53] <RAOF> insmod: Ah, that's better.  No, I don't know, check out launchpad
[05:53] <Kickersny> it was finding a spot on a mirror I assume
[05:53] <Ubuntunoob> hi all
[05:53] <ajax4> zero88: You can optimize it to your exact hardware, but its not for beginners :)
[05:53] <Nergar> don't you all LOVE feisty!?!?! its AWESOME!!!!
[05:53] <Kickersny> Nergar, yes
[05:53] <bobbob1016> crimsun, one sec
[05:53] <RAOF> zero88: The advantages: none.  the disadvantages: You are no longer able to be supported
[05:54] <PresuntoRJ> Frog29: bizzar
[05:54] <slop> i am op in #windowsvsnixdebate
[05:54] <zero88> ajax4 RAOF oh ok,then ill stear clear of that for now :)
[05:54] <ajax4> SuperLag: Thumbs up. Getting the nvidia drivers working and setting up xgl ("desktop effects") was a snap.
[05:54] <codepoet> while trying to install Samsung unified linux drivers, I get the error "ERROR: HARDWARE_PLATFORM undefined, execution aborted" - any idea what I can do?
[05:54] <bimberi> zero88: you might get a (marginal at best) performance increase.  However you are then responsible for applying security patches - if you care.
[05:54] <Nergar> great support and lots of new features!!
[05:54] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - yea
[05:54] <bobbob1016> crimsun, it says OSS next to the device I'm using
[05:54] <blrich> can someone tell me how to install a package from packages.ubuntu.com?  i have a package.orig.tar.gz containing a bunch of .pkg files and i have no idea how to install it with dpkg
[05:54] <crimsun> bobbob1016: please choose ALSA instead.
[05:54] <zero88> bimberi so its jsut basically for hardware and optimization?
[05:54] <Frog29> PresuntoRJ - any chance it has the wrong driver?
[05:54] <ap1> How do I list console installed keymaps? loadkeys --what?
[05:54] <ireland> okay...so how do i list partitions with parted...can't get the damn thing to work.
[05:54] <blrich> i am in a real bind, if anyone can help that would be great

[05:55] <slop> HEKP!
[05:55] <Shaddox> Is Feisty support still at #ubuntu+1?
[05:55] <blrich> Flannel, and that'll work even with an orig.tar.gz in the same directory?
[05:55] <Nergar> whats the devs channel???
[05:55] <RAOF> zero88: The only time you'd want to compile your own kernel is when the new kernel supports a piece of hardware you have, and the Ubuntu kernel doesn't.
[05:55] <bobbob1016> crimsun, no sound in anything now
[05:55] <Ubuntunoob> HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP im going blind
[05:55] <Kickersny> Shaddox, I would guess that's for Gutsy
[05:55] <bimberi> zero88: that would be the main reason to roll-your-own yes
[05:55] <blrich> Flannel, do i have to put the tar.gz in the package repository dir or something?
[05:55] <jessid> !fakeroot
[05:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fakeroot - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[05:55] <SuperLag> Ubuntunoob: chill out
[05:55] <Flannel> blrich: no.  That works through the internet.  Package.ubuntu.com is a place to browse.  You don't need the tar.gz

[05:55] <RAOF> blrich: You should download the .deb file from packages.ubuntu.com.  That's what dpkg understands.
[05:56] <Fujitsu> !botspam | jessid
[05:56] <Shaddox> Okay, then I'll ask here. How do I copy a folder from my laptop to my server over an SSH connection onto my server as a sudo, so I can copy it to /usr/local/hlserver/ns ?
[05:56] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about botspam - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:56] <blrich> Flannel, well i downloaded the package because i don't have the internet, i need to install it manually before i get drivers support for my network card to get on to the net
[05:56] <Nergar> slop, thnx
[05:56] <rellik> why is it that ubuntu releases don't have round numbers?  6.06, 6.10, 7.04..  these seem like unusual versions for major releases
[05:56] <Ubuntunoob> thx a lot!
[05:56] <jessid> Fujitsu what do yo mean?
[05:56] <Kickersny> rellik, year.month :)
[05:56] <Fujitsu> rellik: They are year.month, so 7.04 is April 2007.
[05:56] <crimsun> labanux: lsmod|grep ^snd
[05:56] <rellik> ahhhhh
[05:56] <blrich> RAOF, i can't find the .deb files on the site, where would the link be? i search for the package and down the bottom of the package page it just has an orig.tar.gz and a diff.tar.gz
[05:56] <crimsun> labanux: (to pastebin)
[05:56] <bobbob1016> crimsun, under Devices I have two things, one is Intel and it says ALSA mixer next to it, and the Realtek says OSS, neither work on any of the settings
[05:56] <Fujitsu> jessid: You're somewhat abusing the bot.
[05:56] <ryeth25> .theme
[05:56] <DPic> I just created a new partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to appear so that i can use it?
[05:57] <RAOF> blrich: Is there any reason you're trying to download them manually anyway?
[05:57] <crimsun> bobbob1016: make sure it's set to ALSA
[05:57] <Shaddox> Okay, then I'll ask here. How do I copy a folder from my laptop to my server over an SSH connection onto my server as a sudo, so I can copy it to /usr/local/hlserver/ns ?
[05:57] <bobbob1016> crimsun, they all are
[05:57] <bobbob1016> crimsun, even the device
[05:57] <crimsun> bobbob1016: then, in a Terminal, type: aplay /usr/share/sounds/*up.wav
[05:57] <Ubuntunoob> thx @ all supporter & bb
[05:57] <Flannel> blrich: ah.  You need to download the .debs, that gz you have now is a list of names of packages.
[05:57] <kofwang> help, when i restart system after upgrade to 704, boot fail
[05:57] <kofwang>  Alert! /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxxxxxx-xxx-xx-xxxx dose not exist, Dropping to a shell!!
[05:57] <Fujitsu> Shaddox: You'll probably have to scp to your home directory, then copy with sudo from there.
[05:57] <blrich> RAOF, yeah i have no drivers for my network card because it's on a new mobo with nforce 430 chipset, i need to get the restricted drivers package for it to work (or so i'm trying)
[05:57] <bobbob1016> it said playing
[05:58] <bobbob1016> crimsun, it said playing
[05:58] <SuperLag> Shaddox: rsync is probably the easiet way
[05:58] <DPic> Somebody? I just created a new partition using the Ubuntu live CD but how do i get it to show up so that i can use it?
[05:58] <RAOF> blrich: The restricted drivers package is on all of the install CDs.
[05:58] <BlackDalek> why won't any ntp servers I add to the servers in "Time and Date Settings" stick?
[05:58] <bobbob1016> crimsun, and I didn't hear anything
[05:58] <blrich> Flannel, okay cool, but where do i find the .deb downloads? there doesn't seem to be any links to a .deb on the individual package pages
[05:58] <albert> flannel: found everything, thanks
[05:58] <jessid> Fujitsu mmm sorry...did not want to bother...perhaps you know something about compiling the kernel with the keyspan driver...or you might know where to go first...
[05:58] <Flannel> blrich: on each package's page, at the bottom, is a little table with different arches.  Click your arch, and you'll be able to choose a mirror to download a specific .deb file. install that with dpkg (don't forget dependencies!)
[05:58] <Shaddox> Fujitsu: Can you explain how? I'm still a ubuntu nubcaek, and finally got Cedega working for my Steam and stuff.
[05:58] <crimsun> bobbob1016: please pastebin `cat /proc/asound/cards && amixer` , then tell me the URL of the paste
[05:58] <blrich> RAOF, a-ha, should i a cd repos in apt sources to get it off?
[05:58] <Flannel> blrich: OH wait.
[05:58] <Shaddox> SuperLag: Is it easier then what Fujitsu said? I'm extremely confused. X_x
[05:58] <T0uCH> i had a power failure earlier today during the installation of feisty 7.04... the installation has stop... but now the problem is i cant restart the install of the packages that we're installed on the first upgrades(the one with the power failure) and it seems now that upgrades manager is installing version 6.10 ... i allready got this one... somebody can help what i should do now?
[05:58] <Flannel> blrich: You need ndiswrapper?
[05:58] <blrich> Flannel, ah cool thankyou!
=== centauri is now known as jpcentanni
[05:58] <SuperLag> blrich: why not just use apt or synaptic, like it's designed?
[05:58] <slop> #windowsvsnixdebate
[05:58] <Flannel> slop: please stop
[05:58] <blrich> Flannel, no i have nforce 430 chipset, i need restricted drivers, which i *think* will work
[05:59] <lowfront> Ya I'm on feisty!!!
[05:59] <wj32> hi
[05:59] <lowfront> I like
[05:59] <ap1> update-rc.d works like always? Not replaces by any Ubuntu fancy? Works with the graphical tools for services and bum?
[05:59] <blrich> SuperLag, , i dont have a net connection on the affected machine
[05:59] <RAOF> blrich: Actually, now that I look at it.  There is no nforce driver in the restricted drivers package.
[05:59] <SuperLag> Shaddox: are you on the machine you want to copy to?
[05:59] <wj32> can i upgrade easily from edgy to feisty using the desktop cd?
[05:59] <SuperLag> blrich: why not?
[05:59] <Hasrat_USA> how come you had a power failure?
[05:59] <RAOF> blrich: But does it *really* not have a driver for it out of the box?  That sucks.
[05:59] <Flannel> blrich: Restricted drivers?  That's not a package.  But, ndiswrapper is on the CD you have, you dont need to sneakernet, youve already got it
[05:59] <wj32> i'm currently going to upgrade using the alternate cd
[05:59] <bobbob1016> crimsun, http://pastebin.ca/449306
[05:59] <Flannel> wj32: no.  Alternate CD.
[05:59] <blrich> RAOF, oh good :( oh well i thought there might be something caus it has nvidia stuff
[05:59] <ireland> exit
[05:59] <crimsun> ap1: yes, we still use update-rc.d in maintainer scripts. Beware mucking with upstart scripts.
[05:59] <MrMakeveli> hey guys, who here uses the old school xchat and not the gnome frontend one?
[05:59] <RAOF> blrich: Na, it's only got the nvidia graphics driver.
[06:00] <slop> MrMakeveli: irssi!
[06:00] <SuperLag> irssi++
[06:00] <Flannel> blrich: you might be interested in ndiswrapper
[06:00] <Flannel> !wifi | blrich
[06:00] <ubotu> blrich: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[06:00] <Shaddox> SuperLag: I'm on the machine I'm copying FROM.
[06:00] <crimsun> bobbob1016: ...you do realize that 'PCM' is set to 0% , correct?
[06:00] <slop> EST: timechange!
[06:00] <MrMakeveli> SuperLag, is irss++ a irc client?
[06:00] <RAOF> Flannel: But it's not a wireless network card?
[06:00] <blrich> Flannel, RAOF, SuperLag, the problem is when i run lspci, it just has tonnes of 'unknown nvidia device'. the built in ethernet on the board has drivers for it, but (i think) because i don't have drivers for the system bus (nforce 430 drivers) i can't even get the system to see the ethernet either
[06:00] <Flannel> RAOF: What?  Oh.  Sorry. blrich, I wasnt paying attention I guess.
[06:01] <ap1> I don't have Sys/Adm/Disks, that the Help system describes?
[06:01] <bobbob1016> crimsun, I have the system tray all the way up
[06:01] <kerik> Hey guys!
[06:01] <MrMakeveli> slop, irssi++ is a irc client?
[06:01] <aldin> hi, can someone tell ppl from packages.ubuntu.com to set up feisty (as default choise) when searching packages, cause there is edgy still... feedback?
[06:01] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: irssi is.
[06:01] <trillian> I upgraded to Feisty and am having graphics prolems - I have an ATI graphics card which worked before and showed up in fglrxinfo, but now I'm seeing Mesa. It likewise isn't appearing in the "Restricted Driver Manager" panel, and I've tried tutorials such as http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide but although everything will seem to go through I'll restart and it will stay Mesa drivers. I'd appreciate any help or advice (alth
[06:01] <trillian> ough I could live with Mesa for a few days until things calm down)
[06:01] <Shaddox> SuperLag: I think I've figured something out, hold up.
[06:01] <crimsun> bobbob1016: no.  amixer set 'PCM' 80%
[06:01] <RAOF> blrich: Oh, lspci *always* has a bunch of unknown devices.  That's no problem.
[06:01] <kerik> anyone who can tell me what an "error 2" when updating is?
[06:01] <SuperLag> Shaddox: get on the machine you want to copy to, in the directory you want to copy to
[06:01] <blrich> RAOF, yeah but we're talking every device on the board
[06:01] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, does anyone use the gnome frontend for xchat?
[06:01] <RAOF> blrich: There are no drivers for a system bus.
[06:01] <RAOF> MrMakeveli: I do.
[06:02] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: xchat-gnome is in main, "xchat" is in universe.
[06:02] <blrich> RAOF, it'sa gigabyte g61p-s3, it's new and therefore there are no drivers (apparently)
[06:02] <ryeth25> ~/.irssi/config
[06:02] <ryeth25> dammit
[06:02] <bobbob1016> crimsun, nm, I feel really stupid now, it is usually the easiest thing, isn't it?
[06:02] <kerik> it seems I cannot reach  http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/dapper-security/restricted/source/Sources.bz2..anyone know why?
[06:02] <bobbob1016> crimsun, it works
[06:02] <SuperLag> Shaddox: then do this... rsync://source_IP_from_other_machine:/dir/you/want/copied .
[06:02] <bobbob1016> crimsun, I had to right click the sound thing and open volume control
[06:02] <MrMakeveli> to clarify, i am using xchat in the uni and not xchat-gnome. is there any reason to use gnome other than aesthetics? it seems like i cant do as much
[06:02] <blrich> RAOF, well you know, north bridge or whatever. all i know is, ubuntu (dapper) is recognising nothing, i don't have a NIC according to it
[06:02] <Kickersny> um... "The program apt-get is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: apt-get install apt"
[06:02] <Shaddox> SuperLag: The machine has no monitor anymore. I forgot it broke last week. X_x I got something good, im using a file browser to copy the folder to my home on the server, then gonna copy it to /usr/local/hlserver/
[06:02] <Kickersny> but of course, when I type that, I get the same thing
[06:02] <milage> Is the SMB shared folders thing supposed to work out of the box?
[06:02] <RAOF> blrich: Oh, *Dapper*?  Sorry, I've been hanging around in #ubuntu+1 for too long.
[06:03] <Rkyraccoon55> anyone know how to change the login screen resolution?
[06:03] <SuperLag> Shaddox: cool.
[06:03] <Flannel> Kickersny: download the .deb from packages.ubuntu.com then install it with `dpkg -i [file] `
[06:03] <RAOF> blrich: Yes, it's entirely possible that Dapper (which is now a full year old) won't have drivers for your stuff.
[06:03] <Shaddox> 844 files copying from me to my server now. :D
[06:03] <BlackDalek> How come when I add a server to the ntp servers list it just disappears?
[06:03] <bobbob1016> crimsun, I still have the beryl problem though
[06:03] <plewis77_> I have the Broadcom 1400 working fine
[06:03] <Shaddox> Natural Selection is a big big mod. ^^
[06:03] <BHSPitMonkey> wow.  the Disk Usage Analyzer had my vote until I just hit Refresh on a single directory, and it decided to refresh the whole drive.
[06:03] <milage> It doesn't seem to be doing so for me
[06:03] <Kickersny> Flannel, I'll give it a shot
[06:03] <blrich> RAOF, it's kubuntu too, so god knows if they even have an edgy or feisty version out, it's for dad's dev machine so he wants dapper because he doesn't want any new versions of stuff he's working on (gtk, python, etc.)
[06:03] <crimsun> bobbob1016: I don't care for beryl, sorry.
[06:04] <blrich> RAOF, hmm i might just try and get a feisty cd and see if it works
[06:04] <Rkyraccoon55> anyone know how to change the login screen resolution?
[06:04] <MrMakeveli> is xchat-gnome > xchat?
[06:05] <evandsays> question: i just installed kubuntu on my macbook... and the touchpad works well... but i want to configure some settings... i cant find the settings for that anywhere (not in mouse settings).. anyone know where the settings are?
[06:05] <jessid> see you later!!!
[06:05] <ap1> Do I get a complete list of all devices with mount, lpci, lsusb?
[06:05] <gr3ml1n> hi i have a problem with cedega 6.0
[06:05] <gr3ml1n> Can't seem to be able to execute the WineX start up script /home/gr3ml1n/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-6.0/bin/winex3 - perhaps your installation of WineX version default is corrupted?
[06:05] <Flannel> MrMakeveli: no.  Theyre different. Most people prefer the latter.
[06:05] <trillian> I upgraded to Feisty from Edgy and am having graphics card problems - I have an ATI graphics card which worked before and showed up in fglrxinfo, but now I'm seeing Mesa. It likewise isn't appearing in the "Restricted Driver Manager" panel, and I've tried tutorials such as http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide but although everything will seem to go through I'll restart and it will stay Mesa drivers. I'd appreciate any help
[06:05] <trillian>  or advice (although I could live with Mesa for a few days until things calm down)
[06:05] <milage> I selected a folder to share through the "Shared Folders" administration panel, and chose to enable write access for it
[06:05] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: is the login res different from your res when logged in?
[06:05] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, thank god, i thought i was the only one
[06:05] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik yea
[06:05] <mojojojo_> Which distribution of Feisty Fawn should I choose if I have Core 2 Due processor?
[06:05] <Taime1> i installed beryl, but only get the tray icon, beryl isnt running, and when i choose beryl as the window manager, it just blinks and goes back to using metacity
[06:05] <milage> When I access it from a different PC, i'mpropted for a user/pass
[06:05] <Taime1> why?
[06:05] <Hobart> trying to upgrade a 1GB pendrive commandline install of Feisty.  Does aptitude check for disk free space before acting?
[06:05] <MrMakeveli> Flannel, it could be a little more pretty, but i think i enjoy it more
[06:05] <Kickersny> Flannel, wget: command not found
[06:05] <Flannel> gr3ml1n: #cedega
[06:05] <gecko> hey all... can someone point me in the right direction for customizing ubuntu (appearance wise..)?
[06:05] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik it cuts off the bottom of the screen on the login window but not when logged on
[06:05] <Kickersny> how else can I download it?
[06:05] <Kickboy> I need some assistance with my 6.10 to 7.04 upgrade. I tried doing the upgrade through the update manager, but it was taking waaay too long. So I stopped it, and downloaded the "Alternate CD" to do it from there (Since BitTorrent is faster, it took only 20 minutes to DL). Well, now because I stopped the first upgrade ALL of my packwages are no longer authenticated, making it completely impossible for me to upgrade. Any ideas?
[06:05] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: sounds wacko :)...are you using x?
[06:06] <Flannel> Kickersny: Why'd you break wget?
[06:06] <labanux> crimsun: still here??
[06:06] <milage> the shared folder admin panel didn't have anywhere to input any users
[06:06] <Rkyraccoon55> im using the default
[06:06] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik im using the default
[06:06] <milage> so i tried what I use to log in to linux
[06:06] <Kickersny> Flannel, this is first boot; I didn't even get to a GUI
[06:06] <milage> but that didn't work
[06:06] <mojojojo_> Which distribution of Feisty Fawn should I choose if I have Core 2 Due processor?
[06:06] <RAOF> blrich: Yeah, try the Feisty LiveCD, and possibly just install a Dapper chroot into it :)
[06:06] <milage> This would be 6.10
[06:06] <Flannel> Kickersny: Your install didn't work
[06:06] <Kickersny> blast
[06:06] <gecko> mojojojo_:  you from ohio?
[06:06] <Flannel> Kickersny: you're missing... probably most of your install.
[06:06] <blrich> RAOF, ooh good call :P
[06:06] <csmanx> my ubuntu dapper dvd doesn't have rescue mode =/
[06:06] <blrich> RAOF, yeah i'll have to do that
[06:06] <mojojojo_> gecko: no, why?
[06:06] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: obkb....have you tried system -> settings > resolution?
[06:07] <bobbob1016> can anyone help me with getting AIGLX to work with beryl?  I had XGL and the ATI driver on Edgy, but now I can't switch it to AIGLX
[06:07] <RAOF> mojojojo_: You can use either the i386 or the AMD64 version, either will work.
[06:07] <blrich> RAOF, SuperLag Flannel thanks for your help :)
[06:07] <T0uCH> i had a power failure earlier today during the installation of feisty 7.04... the installation has stop... but now the problem is i cant restart the install of the packages that we're installed on the first upgrades(the one with the power failure) and it seems now that upgrades manager is installing version 6.10 ... i allready got this one... somebody can help what i should do now?
[06:07] <Abom> hey pppoe_dude, still there? I had my linux friend try to troubleshoot it more with me and still we haven't been able to get online
[06:07] <bambie> ubuntu 6.0 doesn't have ex-chat on it?
[06:07] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik, yea that seems to only be for once logged in
[06:07] <gecko> mojojojo_: same exact name was a guy i used to game with...he was from very very east ohio lol
[06:07] <evandsays> anyone know how to configure the macbook's touchpad for KDE in kubuntu??
[06:07] <fluid> and now im having issues...installed the latest (horrible i know) ati drivers for this chipset...all went well. the xorg error log is showing that its attempting to load an older fglrx module...anybody know how to fix that?
[06:07] <bambie> xchat i meant
[06:07] <bobbob1016> Beryl didn't work on my XGL after upgrading to Feisty
[06:07] <Flannel> bambie: 6.06 has xchat-gnome in main, and xchat in universe
[06:07] <RAOF> bobbob1016: Join #ubuntu-effects for that, there's too much noise in here!
[06:07] <Abom> pppoe_dude: I tried doing sudo iwconfig for my wireless and plugging in just about everything I could manually but nothing worked
[06:07] <crimsun> labanux: I'm awaiting the information that I requested.
[06:07] <bobbob1016> RAOF, sorry, forgot about that channel
[06:07] <pppoe_dude> Abom, did you do the if up/down commands?
[06:07] <mojojojo_> RAOF: yeah, but I'm wondering which one will perform better
[06:07] <labanux> crimsun : this is the output : http://pastebin.ca/449300
[06:07] <pppoe_dude> Abom, did you get messages?
[06:07] <milage> Is any of you able to help me a bit with SMB shared folders?
[06:08] <gecko> where can i go to figure out how to customize ubuntu appearance wise? like talking about themes and stuff?
[06:08] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: yeah...you might be right on that one...
[06:08] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: 2 sec
[06:08] <Kickersny> gecko, gnome-looks.org
[06:08] <csmanx> oh well
[06:08] <csmanx> I'll try to download a cd image
[06:08] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik: thanks
=== fools is now known as foolsout
[06:08] <RAOF> mojojojo_: The AMD64 version, but you probably won't notice the difference unless you're doing CPU intensive stuff
[06:08] <mojojojo_> gecko: I'm from Poland, so it's rather distant from there :)
[06:08] <csmanx> this is ridiculous
[06:08] <gecko> Kickersny:  i have...i jus need to find out how to change applications menu button change...
[06:08] <dc> If i install using the disk, will it format my disk or will it upgrade?
[06:08] <Abom> o ya know what, I did those first, and then I got an error, posted him the error and he said, "o woops you gotta do it with sudo beforehand" and I don't think I did it after that...
[06:08] <Kickersny> gecko, http://gnome-look.org/
[06:08] <Abom> what were they again?
[06:08] <Kickersny> sorry, had the URL wrong
[06:09] <T0uCH> i had a power failure earlier today during the installation of feisty 7.04... the installation has stop... but now the problem is i cant restart the install of the packages that we're installed on the first upgrades(the one with the power failure) and it seems now that upgrades manager is installing version 6.10 ... i allready got this one... somebody can help what i should do now?
[06:09] <gecko> Kickersny:  ive installed themes and stuff, i just want to change an icon...the menu icon on "start" menu...if you understand lol
[06:09] <trillian> I'm having an ATI Raedon problem. I upgraded from Feisty and the card was working and showing up in fglrxinfo but it's now showing mesa. Likewise, the card is not showing up in the 'restricted drivers manager' and i'm not sure how to load it. i've tried online tutorials but so far have had no luck
[06:09] <labanux> crimsun : that's the only information you need doesn't it?
[06:09] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: in system > admin > login how is your x's set?

[06:10] <gecko> Kickersny:  its ok..... i just cant seem to find anyone who knows much about changing THOSE kind of system files lol...
[06:10] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik: how do you mean? "default session 'run xclient script'"?
[06:10] <Taime1> where can i get beryl support??????????????????
[06:10] <Kickersny> gecko, check /usr/share
[06:10] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: btw....dapper or Edgy/Feisty?
[06:10] <crimsun> labanux: no, I also asked for `lsmod|grep ^snd`

[06:10] <Taime1> thanks

[06:10] <trillian> I'm trying to reinstall xorg-driver-fglrx but the main archive.ubuntu repository isn't loading. do any mirrors have it? (none i've tried seem to)
[06:10] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: I mean your little "ticks" in the boxes in there :)
[06:11] <pppoe_dude> trillian, try downloading from packages.ubuntu.com
[06:11] <ap1> RAOF, thx
[06:11] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: I don't know if there is any change from Dapper to Feisty though...
[06:11] <gecko> trillian:  are you having an issue with it being slow upon updates? if you give it a few...it will work
[06:11] <gecko> trillian: i had that problem earlier today
[06:11] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik: first 2 checked, no 3, yes 4, 5, no 6
[06:11] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: as Im using dapper...
[06:11] <whta> i noticed when choosing to upgrade, it'll be removing my old beryl install. will i have to redo all my settings for that?
[06:11] <MrMakeveli> are the repos still doing this bad?!
[06:11] <bambie> how can i install xchat on ubuntu 6.06?
[06:11] <trillian> gecko: it's not being slow, it's saying the connection timed out
[06:11] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik: oh
[06:11] <trillian> gecko: i've literally not been able to connect to it all day
[06:11] <labanux> crimsun: lsmod|grep ^snd  return nothing, i've tried this too 'lsmod|grep snd", still return nothing..
[06:12] <whta> and i expect these terrible download speeds are because of massive traffic? :p
[06:12] <BlackDalek> internet time server synchronizing... anyone got any clues?
[06:12] <bambie> cause mine doesn't have xchat i've been using gaim for ircing but i dont really like it :/
[06:12] <crimsun> labanux: now, `sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel`
[06:12] <Awperator> Hello guys, another question thanks for all the help so far. I mistakenly make my home partition only 1.0GB and my swap 10GB but I just resized it using the feisty liveCD. But now my /home is still showing 300MB free space. What do I need to do? Gparted shows the size of the /home partition as 10GB, why dont I have all that space now?
[06:12] <gecko> trillian: i had to take a command line approach... it took 2 hours to figure it out...it told me apt-get wasnt right...i didnt have rights.... i rebooted and it was fine
[06:12] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik: :show visual feedback", "use circles instead of asterisks", "disable multiple logins", "default session"
[06:12] <voraistos> bambie: sudo apt-get install xchat
[06:12] <voraistos> or xchat-irc
[06:13] <Madpilot> bambie, enable Universe, install xchat via apt-get, Synaptic or Add/Remove
[06:13] <trillian> gecko: i'm just doin 'sudo apt-get update' and it's timing out
[06:13] <bambie> voraistos thank you.
[06:13] <fluid> anyone know what i can do when i install a newer kernel module and Xorg is attempting to load an older preexisting one instead of the new one?
[06:13] <gr3ml1n> how to enable mouse button 3 4 and 5 ?
[06:13] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: ok...I have nothing like that :/
[06:13] <voraistos> bambie: i think xchat-gnome is included in the main repo.
[06:13] <bambie> one more thing, how can i change my real name/ username?
[06:13] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: that's in settings for the login-screen?
[06:14] <Awperator> gr3mlin what type of mouse?

[06:14] <swj> has anyone notice that you have gksudo brasero or gnome baker before burning?
[06:14] <trillian> pppoe_dude, i'm not sure how to download from packages.ubuntu.com - is it actually a repository or am i downloading files from my browser?
[06:14] <voraistos> bambie: look in the preferences menu.
[06:14] <crimsun> labanux: and what was the result?
[06:14] <kerik> Rkyraccoon55: I sure believe it has....sorry mate
[06:14] <pppoe_dude> trillian, files from browser
[06:14] <Rkyraccoon55> kerik: its cool i appreciate the help anyways
[06:14] <diabolix> I know how fix this.. but why is the installer completely useless at 800x600 when thats what it set my resolution to?
[06:14] <pppoe_dude> trillian, you can search and download the package you want, then sudo dpkg -i <package> to install it
[06:15] <pppoe_dude> trillian, there are a lot of mirrors there
[06:15] <bambie> voraistos alright thanks alot

[06:16] <whta> are there improved printer drivers with feisty? one HUGE drawback i've found so far with ubuntu is that  my printer won't work properly with it.

[06:20] <s0undt3ch> hello ppl, I recently bought a LG P1 Express Pro laptop, couldn't get feity to install, although 6.10 I could, but my gigabit lan card although detected, was not loaded, got any sugestions?
[06:20] <trillian> i'm attempting to reinstall xorg-driver-fglrx because I can't get it working with the download from ATI and get the following error: "Reinstallation of xorg-driver-fglrx is not possible, it cannot be downloaded."
[06:20] <diabolix> Frog29: and then look for all the lines that look like  Modes           "800x600" and add "1024x768" in front of "800x600"
[06:20] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: i did
[06:20] <vexati0n> SuperLag, trying to fool vmware.
[06:20] <deepsa> EverythingEvil2: update-rc.d ?
[06:20] <Nergar> MrMakeveli, they're like screen post its
[06:20] <diabolix> Frog29: then press alt+ctr+backspace
[06:20] <trillian> zilly, you can download the feisty alternate CD and can upgrade from that
[06:20] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: what error did you get?
[06:20] <Nergar> BHSPitMonkey, what does it do?
[06:21] <zilly6_> trillian, what if i already downloaded it via bittorrent?
[06:21] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: i dunno, broke a lot of stuff
[06:21] <trillian> (although I'm having mixed luck with it....it might just suggest waiting a week and doing the built-in download upgrade, or a fresh install. can't tell if it's just my bad luck, or not)
[06:21] <ap1> ok, so the WLAN question. I booted Edgt CD on my Thinkpad Z60m and configured the WLAN graphically. It said reconfiguring devices, but nothing seemed to happen after that? How do I debug?
[06:21] <billy> tonyr1988, keep getting "command not found".  hm ...
[06:21] <zilly6_> trillan i grabbed desktop
[06:21] <BHSPitMonkey> Nergar, lets you shoot at people over teh internet.

[06:21] <marvin_> i'm starting evolution with --debug to fix an auth problem i seem to have. everything seems fine, but in the file the username and password are hidden, so i can't check them. is there a way to make them not hidden w/o recompiling?
[06:21] <fluid> brb...gotta restart
[06:21] <trillian> zilly6_, from what i could tell, you can only *upgrade* from edgy to feisty from the alternate CD - i did the same thing and had to redownload the alternate (which only took, like, another half hour - there are tons of people seeding)
[06:21] <guitrokr> hello?

[06:22] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[06:22] <zilly6_> trillian ok, i'll let it go over night. do you know of a good guide for setting proper screen resolution?

[06:26] <diabolix> Frog29: what graphics card is it?
[06:26] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: well, for video you would have to recompile the modules im willing to bet
[06:26] <trillian> Does anyone know how the 'restricted driver manager' works? i'm trying to get an ati raedon card working and failing...silly mesa
[06:26] <deepsa> chainlynx: apt-get because it's command line more powerful and stable
[06:26] <guitrokr> can i install and boot from an external hard drive with no problem?
[06:26] <zcat[1] > chainlynx, update-manager -c I think..
[06:26] <mjbrooks> chainlynx, either/or   because it's a personal preference
[06:26] <billy> chainlynx, i'd go with aptitude because it will automatically install recommended packages.

[06:28] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: ah

[06:28] <Draconicus> zcat[1] : That's interesting, because this is a brand new, shiny, fresh install. No changes made. One user.
[06:28] <deepsa> Draconicus: ps aux | grep apt please
[06:28] <Frog29> Diabolix - o
[06:28] <Nergar> Gaim crashes when i try to open a IRC account

[06:29] <zcat[1] > *off
[06:29] <ubotu> xphaqtor: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[06:29] <deepsa> Nergar: run from a terminal and paste the exact crash report please? which version of ubuntu btw?
[06:29] <unikuser> Frog29:did you try restricted driver manager?
[06:29] <Black_> !torrents
[06:29] <ubotu> Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[06:29] <commonlyUNIQU3> please HELP!  how do I activate a PCMCIA wifi card?  I can see it with lcpci (it shows up as an Ethernet Controller)
[06:29] <xphaqtor> cool, thx...just making sure it wasn't just me
[06:29] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: i have no idea about wireless, i dont use it, dont need it
[06:29] <Nergar> deepsa, feisty
[06:29] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: sorry man
[06:29] <s0undt3ch> please some help on a gigabit lan card detected but now brought up?!
[06:29] <guitrokr> is there anyone here who would answer a question for me in private IM real quick about installing ubuntu (feisty) to an external hard drive?
[06:29] <xphaqtor> my wireless isn't working as well
[06:29] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: that's cool ;)
[06:29] <deepsa> Nergar: paste the crash report please on the paste site in /topic

[06:29] <ubotu> guitrokr: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first, some find it rude.
[06:29] <drfrog666> can anyone help me w FF7.04 atiX1400 install?
[06:29] <labanux> crimsun : i've tried that.. but using the beta version.. I've compiled and install everything, alsa-driver, lib, utils, etc.. But it still didn't work at all..
[06:29] <deepsa> xphaqtor: don't say not working tell the problem exact problem
[06:30] <deepsa> xphaqtor: with error messages
[06:30] <Frog29> Diabolix - again... ?
[06:30] <crimsun> labanux: argh, you completely messed up Ubuntu's audio infrastructure
[06:30] <s0undt3ch> drfrog666: we're on the same boat
[06:30] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: seems from the bot that I should just wait and see when the servers are not under such heavy attack :)
[06:30] <diabolix> Frog29: there should be a section titled "Section "Device"" and it should have a driver line.
[06:30] <xphaqtor> well, it recognizes the card, but that's as far i can get
[06:30] <Whiz2> I'm using my Kubuntu computer as a dedicated web server, and I have some php pages on it. one of the features of the php pages is php mail. is there a special module or configuration i need to set in order for php mail to work? (I'm using a dapper release)
[06:30] <s0undt3ch> drfrog666: what's your machine?
[06:30] <sizzam> i'm using Feisty, should /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny exist on a fresh install?
[06:30] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: yea, it takes forever to pull down anything
[06:30] <Frog29> Diabolix - yea.... all it has is Generic Monitor so what shoudl  ichange it to?
[06:30] <Draconicus> deepsa: Well that's interesting. Either there was an invisible instance of Synaptic or it was labeling both the Synaptic main window and error window. Either way, it showed two different windows with very different owners, but one was created by root, while the other was in gksu, so it's still plausably the first. I'll try reloading again.
[06:30] <marvinalone> hmm, the day after the release might not be a good time to ask in-depth questions here ;-)
[06:30] <crimsun> labanux: please reinstall linux-sound-base, alsa-base, libasound2, alsa-utils, and linux-image-$(uname -r)
[06:30] <xphaqtor> it acknowledges that its there, i've installed the drivers using ndis, but im not even getting a power led on the card
[06:30] <BlackDalek> Ug! me no can add server to ntp server list. bad bad server list make good new ntp server vanish! how me fix? Ug! etc...
[06:30] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: that might be why I get server timeouts?
[06:30] <diabolix> Frog29: search for "vesa" in the file.
[06:30] <s0undt3ch> drfrog666: mine is a LG P1 Express Pro
[06:31] <noesis> have not  install 7.04 yet but digg seems to be  harping on it , what is wrong with this verson
[06:31] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: wouldnt be surprised
[06:31] <deepsa> Draconicus: well man when u do a fresh install update manager runs in the background
[06:31] <diabolix> Frog29: you can hit ctrl-F to search.
[06:31] <wideback> does anyone know how i can find out what wireless driver im using?
[06:31] <Draconicus> deepsa: That's a pain in the ass. You should disable that.

[06:31] <labanux> crimsun: btw, i've remove all of that package i've installed manually, then I reinstall what just told me.., but it still didn't worked.
[06:31] <Draconicus> deepsa: It'll confuse the hell out of new users.
[06:31] <deepsa> Draconicus: we will in gusty okay man
[06:31] <mjbrooks> noesis, the question you should be asking is what's wrong with digg
[06:31] <wideback> does anyone know how i can find out what wireless driver im using?
[06:31] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: sounds good...not too buggy?
[06:31] <Nergar> deepsa, never mind, its working now
[06:31] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: i been runnin it since begining of beta, no problems at all
[06:31] <Frog29> Diabolix - k...

[06:32] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: sounds wonderful....
[06:32] <bambi1> thats what it says aftering type sudo apt-get install xchat
[06:32] <Draconicus> Feisty in the beta (this machine) has so much promise. I hope it doesn't turn out to be another Edgy with this fresh install on my client's machine.
[06:32] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: lspci -v please paste output at http://pastebin.ca
[06:32] <deepsa> wideback: np

[06:32] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: it may have that atheros card in the restricted drivers
[06:32] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: yea i need to get to bed
[06:32] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: ok, hang on...
[06:32] <diabolix> Frog29: change "vesa" to "nv" and save it. then hit ctrl-alt-backspace.
[06:33] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: sure i am on
[06:33] <Whiz2> ubotu: I'm assuming that means i need to install this mod using adept, or apt-get?
[06:33] <dxdemetriou> when finish getting the packages for feisty it can't continue and says that rhythmbox have md5 fail. how can this be?
[06:33] <Frog29> Diabolix - ( i am a windows convert :) )
[06:33] <zxagent> good night
[06:33] <mjbrooks> diabolix, yeah, but that's a good thing if you think about it
[06:33] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: it should run ok with the madwifi are they included?
[06:33] <Whiz2> oops
[06:33] <BlackDalek> am I connected?
[06:33] <zcat[1] > Draconicus, test it first! I wouldn't install something for someone else that I hadn't run for a week myself first...
[06:33] <Frog29> Diabolix - done
[06:33] <guitrokr> ummmmmmmmmmmm ok i just downloaded gaim specifically to get into this support group and ask my question in real time, but it just gets ignored everytime
[06:33] <deepsa> dxdemetriou: bad download re-download
[06:33] <diabolix> mjbrooks: true.. true..
[06:33] <s0undt3ch> ubuntu does not ship the atheros driver?
[06:33] <s0undt3ch> EverythingEvil2: ubuntu does not ship the atheros driver?
[06:33] <Frog29> Diabolix - SWEET!
[06:33] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: i dont know about wifi, if its a major restricted driver it shoudl, theres probably a list somewhere
[06:33] <rellik_> guitrokr, you downloaded gaim to get onto IRC?
[06:33] <guitrokr> yes
[06:33] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: hehe...it's sorta cool...here its 06:33 AM :) but sleep tight when you get there :)
[06:34] <BlackDalek> how do I install bollox?
[06:34] <Draconicus> zcat[1] : I'm quite skilled now at making the beta run, as is evidenced in this machine, so I'm not really worried. I just expected less bugs after all that testing and after such stability when I installed this beta.
[06:34] <mjbrooks> guitrokr, as you may have noticed, we're pretty busy
[06:34] <dxdemetriou> deepsa, I tried it many times to redo the upgrade. maybe I'll put manually the file to archives
[06:34] <Frog29> Diabolix - now the question is...... are those the drivers fulyl isntalled? or only partly?
[06:34] <s0undt3ch> EverythingEvil2: is that why my gigabit is detected but not loaded?
[06:34] <guitrokr> is it always like this?
[06:34] <diabolix> Frog29: cool.. now it you want 3d install the official driver and change that line to "nvidia".. but at least its more usuable for now...
[06:34] <nothlit> guitrokr: you haven't actually asked your question
[06:34] <deepsa> dxdemetriou: repos slow today
[06:34] <kerik> EverythingEvil2: sounds like I should just try :)
[06:34] <nothlit> !anyone | guitrokr
[06:34] <Frog29> Diabolix - aka can it do 3-d things or scroll smoothly
[06:34] <ubotu> guitrokr: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[06:34] <guitrokr> prior to this
[06:34] <milage> Is the "Shared Folders" control panel in the administration menu supposed to work?
[06:34] <Gumby> guitrokr: sometimes you have to ask your question multiple times as either there are not enough people to answer or no one that is able to answer actually knows the answer
[06:34] <milage> I can't seem to make it work at least
[06:34] <deepsa> dxdemetriou: possibility that you get bad downloads for a while we are on that
[06:34] <nomasteryoda> deepsa, lol for sure
[06:34] <BlackDalek> can i ask a question?
[06:34] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: madwifi had some issues i read last week
[06:34] <Frog29> Diabolix - well this will work for now  - at least till i can get intenret to do sudo get for the drivers
[06:34] <diabolix> Frog29: you are using the open source driver.. its good enough for regular use, but not 3d.
[06:34] <milage> So it would be nice of someone in here has any idea how to use it
[06:34] <nomasteryoda> Black_, ask, don't ask to ask
[06:34] <EverythingEvil2> kerik: hopefully they are patch so its secure
[06:34] <nomasteryoda> er sorry

[06:35] <rellik_> guitrokr, IRC can be kind of hit or miss.. if no one answers either no one knows or no one noticed..  you just gotta be polite and keep asking.. a lot of times you'll get the help you need, sometimes you just gotta come back and try again
[06:35] <Black_> l
[06:35] <deepsa> dxdemetriou: yeah alot
[06:35] <diabolix> hmm... yeah video configuration is definitely ubuntu's week point.

[06:36] <crimsun> unikuser: what?
[06:37] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: I have a gigabit lan card detected acroding to lspci but if config shows it wasn't configured
[06:37] <BlackDalek> deepsa: i get no error.. the server I add just vanishes every time.
[06:37] <mjbrooks> ap1, I believe you can download a .deb from the skype website
[06:37] <Whiz2> My installation of libapache2-mod-php5 is the most current version, but my php mail isn't working. (No one receives mail sent through php mail at all) can someone tel me what i need to do to configure it to work properly?
[06:37] <diabolix> Frog29: built in to the laptop?
[06:37] <ap1> anticlockwise, Which source for Skype?
[06:37] <crimsun> labanux: then reinstall Ubuntu 7.04, please.

[06:37] <diabolix> Frog29: do you happen to have the windows driver on a cd?
[06:37] <Frog29> Diabolix - it recognizes the card and all but onder the connection settings it says disconnected
[06:37] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: I get that from companny dhcp
[06:37] <anticlockwise> ap1: The source is on skype's home page, I'm sorry I kind of forgot, I'll have check
[06:37] <rellik_> I bet the torrent downloaders are getting super-fast speeds
[06:37] <crimsun> labanux: you've effectively munged the infrastructure to a point where it would take longer to attempt to repair it than to reinstall the entire distribution from scratch.
[06:37] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: paste lsmod please
[06:37] <diabolix> Frog29: hmmm.. are you near an access point?

[06:38] <deepsa> k-edgy: hello
[06:38] <rellik_> somerandomname, wow  I may download it just to see that
[06:38] <k-edgy> i cant update
[06:38] <dc> Tarkus: right click on the iso, burn to disk
[06:38] <SuperLag> Tarkus: cdrecord
[06:38] <guitrokr> if i partition my external with partition magic will i lose my files?
[06:38] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: LG, athera(gigabit)
[06:38] <deepsa> Tarkus: k3b?
[06:38] <dc> If i install using the disk, will it leave my files intact?
[06:38] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: it's up
[06:38] <k-edgy> it says GPG error
[06:39] <zcat[1] > Tarkus, right-click on the iso and select burn to disk
[06:39] <Gumby> tarelerulz: you can install k3b.  its probably one of the best burning programs you'll ever use
[06:39] <SuperLag> yes
[06:39] <RAOF> Tarkus: Yes.  Just right click on the .iso, and select "Burn to disk" :)
[06:39] <k-edgy> is ubuntu site down?

[06:39] <SuperLag> k3b++
[06:39] <Gumby> sorry, Tarkus
[06:39] <deepsa> dc: depends on what disk and partition it is

[06:39] <Frog29> Diabolix - last time i tried connecting to the internet on LAN / ethernet i had problems but thatt was 6.10
[06:39] <dc> deepsa: and i let ubuntu setup my partitions
[06:39] <bamb1> sorry, i got disconnected
[06:39] <deepsa> dc: manual partition i prefer its safer
[06:39] <k-edgy> well, it stuck at edgy-updates
[06:39] <deepsa> bamb1 no problem
[06:40] <bamb1> did anyone get my paste link?
[06:40] <guitrokr> is there high likelihood of losing my data, because i have alot and nobody has another external large enough to store my data
[06:40] <Meshezabeel> k-edgy: if you are trying to download isos use a torrent, it will be done much faster than downloading from a mirror
[06:40] <diabolix> Frog29: hmm.. i dunno. i've never had a problem with wired internet...
[06:40] <dc> deepsa: how would you tell me to do it than?
[06:40] <k-edgy> tells me its a GPG error
[06:40] <umop> I have a blank ext3 partition and would like to add it onto another ext3 partiton, can I do this?
[06:40] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: that card should work out of box
[06:40] <k-edgy> no
[06:40] <deepsa> dc: manual partitions
[06:40] <trelayne2> wired internet sucks anyway... too many lost bees
[06:40] <k-edgy> i'm trying to update using apt-get
[06:40] <trelayne2> I mean wireless
[06:40] <dc> deepsa: i have 6.10 already, i want 7.04 and to leave my home folder and programs intact
[06:40] <BlackDalek> has anyone EVER been able to add an ntp server to the ntp server list? deleting them works fine.. I jut can't ADD any. what's up? Is anyone able to add ntp servers at all?
[06:40] <Hasrat_USA> damn where is the dude who post some kinda bug release report in launchpad? his site kept me busy for over three hours! the bug and the relevant sites are overwhelming!
[06:40] <k-edgy> just a normal edgy update
[06:40] <Frog29> Diabolix - it may work now.... but either way i'll jsut get wireless working and be done with it.. it may even be my network ethernet card......
[06:40] <k-edgy> sudo apt-get update
[06:40] <deepsa> dc: it will just choose manual and select a free partition (free means empty)
[06:41] <Meshezabeel> !slow | k-edgy
[06:41] <ubotu> k-edgy: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[06:41] <zcat[1] > guitrokr, buy a cheap, small drive for linux. Install with nothing else plugged in. You can't go wrong that way..
[06:41] <diabolix> Frog29: well.. if you aren't connected to a network.. it should say disconnected.
[06:41] <k-edgy> owh
[06:41] <k-edgy> no wonder
[06:41] <k-edgy> hehe
[06:41] <dc> deepsa: what?  why mess with partitions when doing an os upgrade?
[06:41] <guitrokr> what if im poor, haha
[06:41] <zxul767> hey, what happened to the beryl channel?
[06:41] <anticlockwise> ap1: http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/ This is the source you add to get skype
[06:41] <diabolix> Frog29: is the ethernet plugged in to the laptop?
[06:41] <k-edgy> trying to update to feisty too
[06:41] <Frog29> Diabolix - no
[06:41] <guitrokr> i really can't afford a new drive
[06:41] <k-edgy> damn.. i'm late
[06:41] <BlackDalek> and why doesn't copy/pste work in gaim?
[06:41] <deepsa> dc: well if you want your data to be safe then take a backup
[06:41] <BlackDalek> paste
[06:41] <diabolix> Frog29: do you have a cable internet?
[06:41] <bamb1> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16489/
[06:41] <Tarkus> MockY, RAOF, zcat[1] , dc: haha, thanks. thats easy enough :D
[06:41] <mjbrooks> !enter | k-edgy
[06:41] <ubotu> k-edgy: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[06:41] <Hasrat_USA> I'm downloading fine here. it's downloaded 532 files so far
[06:41] <Frog29> Diabolix - yes....... but i an't talk at the same time
[06:41] <zcat[1] > guitrokr, you can't afford to lose data either?
[06:41] <bamb1> i'm trying to install xchat
[06:41] <deepsa> BlackDalek: it works
[06:41] <Frog29> *can't
[06:41] <anticlockwise> BlackDalek: it works
[06:41] <guitrokr> well i could, it would suck alot
[06:42] <dc> deepsa: backup has been done, it gets done regularly, but i want to know if there is a way to avoid having to reload data
[06:42] <guitrokr> i could copy the essentials but not the big files like movies
[06:42] <labanux> crimsun: i've already think about that.., that's why i'm downloading the feisty iso right now..., i just wondering maybe it can be fixed without re-install the OS..
[06:42] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: I know, that was my experience in Edgy, but now - NOTHING!  I'm confused
[06:42] <diabolix> Frog29: i know.. but you might want to try resetting you're cable modem before plugging in your laptop.
[06:42] <Flannel> bamb1: xchat-gnome is in main, you'll need to enable universe to get "xchat"
[06:42] <k-edgy> !slow
[06:42] <deepsa> dc: i said how to do that earlier
[06:42] <ubotu> The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[06:42] <BlackDalek> what works? ntp or copy/paste?
[06:42] <zcat[1] > guitrokr, the risk is fairly low anyhow..
[06:42] <dc> deepsa: edit my partition table?
[06:42] <BlackDalek> I can make neither work
[06:42] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: how you set the ip using ifconfig? network tools not working for you
[06:42] <diabolix> Frog29: do "ifconfig -a" on a terminal, and see if it lists a device called "eth0"
[06:42] <trelayne2> Frog29,  are you using dhcp?
[06:42] <k-edgy> !Feisty
[06:42] <ubotu> FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[06:42] <Hasrat_USA> labanux what's your original problem?
[06:42] <deepsa> dc: just tell feisty which partition to get installed on
[06:42] <Frog29> Diabolix - its wierd though... some commands i tried earlier had a lot of messages saying netowrk is down in relationship to my wireless connector (eth1)
[06:42] <milage> Hi. Does anyone know if the graphical SMB configuration tool in Ubuntu 6.10 is supposed to work right out of the box? If it doesn't, what do I need to change manually?
[06:42] <labanux> crimsun: so, it seems no other solution.. Thanx for your help anyway.. :D
[06:43] <guitrokr> so i could in theory nudge the existing primary partition to the right and let the installer create a partition in the newly unallocated space within the 1024 cylinder boundary?
[06:43] <Frog29> trelayne1 - yes
[06:43] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: I just finished a clean install and tried to sudo ifup wlan0
[06:43] <toddian> Hi, I'm having a problem installing feisty fawn; my computer uses SATA and it won't read install cds
[06:43] <Frog29> trelayne2 - yes
[06:43] <Meshezabeel> k-edgy: download the iso from torrent and update from there if you want your update fast, make sure you get the right iso for updates though
[06:43] <bur[n] e1> milage: you just need to run "sudo smbpasswd -a user" to add a samba user
[06:43] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: that device seems a wired lan
[06:43] <zcat[1] > guitrokr, one thing you do need to do, shut down cleanly. If you accidentally boot windows again instead of the CD, let it boot fully and shut down again. If the windows filesystem isn't clean, the linux installer won't even try to resize it.
[06:43] <trelayne2> Frog29,  so what is the ouput of ifconfig?
[06:43] <dc> deepsa: i want it to install it on the same partition as fiesty...
[06:43] <diabolix> Frog29: from the command line, try running "dhclient eth0" after you connect it.
[06:43] <Tarkus> is it good to burn at maximum speed (iso image). or is it better to do slower?
[06:43] <slop> slow ftw
[06:43] <milage> where "user" would be the name of the user, i suppose
[06:43] <Frog29> Diabolix - the command lists eth1 and eth0 ... but no ips for the wirless eth1
[06:43] <dc> Tarkus: depends on the media, slow is more accurate
[06:43] <Madpilot> Tarkus, slower
[06:43] <deepsa> dc: well then i guess you don't have any option data will be formatted
[06:43] <milage> Where would I specify the password?
[06:43] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: I also tried ifup eth0, still no result...
[06:43] <zcat[1] > Tarkus, I recommend 16x or slower
[06:43] <labanux> Hasrat_USA : my sound card didn't work with alsa..  but it works with OSS
[06:43] <guitrokr> duly noted
[06:44] <umop> I have a blank ext3 partition and would like to add it onto another ext3 partiton, can I do this?
[06:44] <Tarkus> alright, ill do 16x then, thanks
[06:44] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: sudo ifconfig eht0 up
[06:44] <Frog29> Diabolix - is it possible to just try and get wireless wrokign for now?
[06:44] <Hasrat_USA> labanux oh and what's your soundcard?
[06:44] <guitrokr> and then should grub go on the external too?
[06:44] <deepsa> umop: you can use gparted but i don't prefer it to newbies
[06:44] <dc> deepsa: so the only way to update and save data is through package manager?
[06:44] <zcat[1] > some people say 4x but that's a bit too slow for me :)
[06:44] <labanux> Hasrat_USA : hda intel..
[06:44] <diabolix> Frog29: its hard to say without an access point.
[06:44] <trelayne2> commonlyUNIQU3,  do /etc/int.d/networ<something> stop                 then do it again with "start"
[06:44] <joeljkp> i need the package xlibs for yahoo's messenger to install, any ideas?
[06:44] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: no such device
[06:44] <commonlyUNIQU3> hmm
[06:44] <k-edgy> how do i add feisty ISO in the repositories list?
[06:44] <deepsa> dc: yeah apt-get dist upgrade
[06:44] <crimsun> Hasrat_USA: he needs to start with a fresh slate.
[06:44] <Frog29> Diabolix - why sepcifically?
[06:44] <bamb1> deepsa may I.
[06:44] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: device is not up that's why i told you to send lsmod via paste
[06:45] <milage> allright bur[n] e1
[06:45] <trelayne2> oops sorry /etc/init.d/network<something> stop
[06:45] <labanux> Hasrat_USA : eventough it works with OSS, I think it's a nightmare to run any mixer from console..
[06:45] <deepsa> bamb1: yeah wasup man
[06:45] <milage> seems like it worked
[06:45] <umop> deepsa, How do i do it in gparted?  I had a look around and really could not find how to combnie them.
[06:45] <diabolix> Frog29: the fact that it lists the device means it found the driver for it, but it doesn't have a network to connect to.
[06:45] <munkymunkyman> hello
[06:45] <milage> I think there should be an option to do that with the GUi tool
[06:45] <deepsa> umop: well i don't prefer gparted for you
[06:45] <deepsa> munkymunkyman: hi
[06:45] <munkymunkyman> how do install glib2.0
[06:45] <k-edgy> how do i add feisty ISO in the repositories list?
[06:45] <labanux> Hasrat_USA : i must using ossmix from command line to adjust or reduce the volume level..
[06:45] <milage> And yeah, tested
[06:45] <bamb1> deepsa i wanna install xchat on my ubuntu
[06:45] <deepsa> munkymunkyman: we use a gui call synaptic and search glib there and install it
[06:45] <umop> deepsa, So you don't know how to do it?
[06:45] <munkymunkyman> everytime i do aptitude install glib2.0 it down grades it
[06:45] <milage> Thanks bur[n] e1, it worked
[06:45] <deepsa> bamb1: then what's the problem
[06:45] <Frog29> Diabolix - i've given it a netowkr to connect to for the wireless.... but it still hasn't sent any packets
[06:46] <bamb1> i dont know how to
[06:46] <diabolix> Frog29: with feisty?
[06:46] <bamb1> i'm new to it
[06:46] <bamb1> lol
[06:46] <BlackDalek> I restarted gaim and now copy paste works again. Is copy/paste functionality locking up like that a special feature of gaim which requires a program restart?
[06:46] <Frog29> Diabolix - it seems as if it isn't even trying with feisty
[06:46] <Meshezabeel> k-edgy: don't think you can add iso directly to the repository, but if you burn it to a cd you can add the cd, there is also a way you can mount an iso, but that's beyond me
[06:46] <deepsa> umop: i know but i guess you don't know and that's why i don't want to let you know. but if you want then you can apt-get gparted
[06:46] <trelayne2> Frog29,  can you do a traceroute ?
[06:46] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: I can't paste cuz it's on an old laptop and no internet connection w/o wireless...  what module am I looking for?
[06:46] <Madpilot> bamb1, use Add/Remove Apps, search for xchat
[06:46] <munkymunkyman> why does it down grade
[06:46] <diabolix> Frog29: it wont send packets until it has a network.
[06:46] <bamb1> ok
[06:46] <Frog29> trelayne1 - ok......
[06:46] <toddian> does anyone know how I could install 7.04 without using install cds, or how to get a weird sata bios to recognize boot cds? And yes, I set it up to boot from cd first
[06:46] <Frog29> *2
[06:46] <munkymunkyman> or does someone know a decent p2p so i dont have to compile giftcurs
[06:46] <billy> I keep reading about an /opt directory, yet I don't seem to have one.  Should I simply create one?
[06:47] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: lsmod | grep 81
[06:47] <BlackDalek> back to my question re: ntp servers.. anyone made any progress with that yet?
[06:47] <kernel06> airlink wireless mimo pcmcia recognizes bY ubuntu but doesn't connect. my card is rt2600.
[06:47] <Frog29> Diabolix - i don't think its even trying to connect to the network though
[06:47] <umop> deepsa, Gparted does not do what i want.  If it does please tell me what I'm doing wrong.
[06:47] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16492/
[06:47] <munkymunkyman> anyone?
[06:47] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: i am on it
[06:47] <Meshezabeel> BlackDalek: do you know where I can get a disused yeti?
[06:47] <diabolix> Frog29: it wont try unless it finds one first.
[06:47] <trelayne2> Frog29,  what is your IP address?
[06:47] <mjbrooks> toddian, does it not boot from it at all or is it getting stuck?
[06:47] <deepsa> umop: if you want to merge two ext3 partitions without deleting?
[06:47] <BlackDalek> can anyone even confirm whether adding of ntp servers is even possible?
[06:48] <Frog29> trelayne2 - ummmmmmm
[06:48] <Madpilot> billy, /opt is in your / (root) directory
[06:48] <deepsa> BlackDalek: it is but i don't know what happening there
[06:48] <diabolix> Frog29: run "iwlist eth1 scan" as root.
[06:48] <k-edgy> thanx Meshezabeel
[06:48] <Frog29> trelayne2 - it hasn't connected to anything
[06:48] <k-edgy> :D
[06:48] <toddian> mjbrooks: doesn't boot at all, doesn't recognize the cds
[06:48] <umop> deepsa, yeah.
[06:48] <toddian> *cd
[06:48] <Meshezabeel> k-edgy: np :)
[06:48] <diabolix> Frog29: "sudo iwlist eth1 scan"
[06:48] <dc> My updater has been stuck in the same place for hours now, is this still normal?!
[06:48] <umop> deepsa, One partition is completely blank, i want to add it to another partition
[06:48] <Frog29> no scanning supported
[06:48] <mjbrooks> toddian, so it just goes through a regular boot or is it giving an error?
[06:48] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: i forgot what i was suppose to look in it? can you tell once more
[06:48] <Frog29> Diabolix - no scanning supported
[06:49] <toddian> if u set it to only boot from cds it gives an error, otherwise it goes through regular boot
[06:49] <deepsa> umop: well not possible if it's not gparted no in-built tools there to do that
[06:49] <diabolix> Frog29: "run ifconfig eth1 up" and then try the scan again.
[06:49] <Rictoo> whenever using apt-get update, it gets stuck at 99%
[06:49] <Rictoo> =/
[06:49] <BlackDalek> Meshezabeel: try #greatintelligence_bootsale ?
[06:49] <deepsa> !slow > Rictoo
[06:49] <mjbrooks> toddian, might be a bad CD
[06:49] <billy> Madpilot, naw, man.  it isn't.  what's up?
[06:49] <Rictoo> deepsa: What?
[06:49] <deCon> do i NEED to backup my /home if it has its own partition while upgrading to Feisty
[06:49] <Frog29> Diabolix - using sudo ifconfig eth1 up it says no such file
[06:49] <toddian> mjbrooks: naw, thats the thing, I tried it in my housemates computer and it worked there
[06:49] <deepsa> !slow | Rictoo
[06:49] <ubotu> Rictoo: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[06:49] <umop> deepsa, I dont understand some of what you are saying.  Are you saying that Gparted will do what I want?
[06:49] <mjbrooks> toddian, have you tried booting that CD on another system?
[06:49] <Meshezabeel> BlackDalek: thanks :p
[06:49] <billy> deCon, always a good idea.  :_
[06:49] <deepsa> umop: yeah
[06:50] <deCon> billy, where to ?
[06:50] <Rictoo> oh
[06:50] <mjbrooks> toddian, hmm
[06:50] <Rictoo> I see :)
[06:50] <umop> deepsa, okay, guess i'll try again
[06:50] <deepsa> Rictoo: ;)
[06:50] <diabolix> Frog29: try "iwlist eth0 scan"
[06:50] <deCon> billy, necessary...or can i squeeze through
[06:50] <toddian> mjbrooks: I had the same problem with windows boot cds, but I thought I'd switch to linux cuz I'm sick of spyware
[06:50] <billy> deCon, to a DVD.  :)
[06:50] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: http://pastebin.ca/449357
[06:50] <deepsa> umop: sure tell me if you get it don i will be glad to know
[06:50] <mjbrooks> toddian, I don't blame ya ;)
[06:50] <Frog29> Diabolix - no scanning supported
[06:50] <deCon> billy, will it overwrite it?
[06:50] <mjbrooks> toddian, is it a laptop?
[06:50] <Madpilot> billy, you'll need to make sure all your repositories are enabled - Xchat is in Universe
[06:50] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: how you got that?
[06:50] <billy> deCon, just be really sure to read everything carefully, as in, don't tell it to format /home.  :)
[06:50] <diabolix> Frog29: run iwconfig.. and see if all devices are missing wireless extensions...
[06:50] <acidtabs> what program was it to stream music for exp: shoutcast
[06:50] <toddian> mjbrooks: nope, it's an asus a7n mobo with amd64 and sata hd
[06:51] <nonuda> !bad device
[06:51] <deCon> billy, i had a feeling it would be smart. Yay Ubuntu!
[06:51] <ubotu> If you are receiving an error similar to this: X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 168 then please visit this page: http://seerofsouls.com/wiki/How-Tos/BadDeviceErrors
[06:51] <munkymunkyman> anyone know why when i do "aptitude install glib2.0" it suggest a downgrade and thats the only way it will let me install?
[06:51] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: by "lsmod | grep 81"
[06:51] <billy> deCon, no.  it won't be overwritten.  It's smart, but you have to tell it that /media/sda2 is to be mounted on /home.
[06:51] <Frog29> Diabolix - eth1 has actual tuff after it
[06:51] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: you don't have this module loaded 8139too ?
[06:51] <mjbrooks> toddian, lemme see if I can find anything with that config
[06:51] <Madpilot> munkymunkyman, where did you get your current glib2.0 from?
[06:51] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: ???  you lost me
[06:51] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16494/
[06:51] <Frog29> Diabolix - the essid nickname mode managed access point invalid
[06:52] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: sudo modprobe 8139too
[06:52] <billy> Madpilot, Xchat?
[06:52] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: I can't get the gibabit to fetch from dhcp
[06:52] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: let me see
[06:52] <diabolix> Frog29: weird.. i guess you can't scan for networks.. when you have a wired network available you might want to look into ndiswrapper. it lets you use the windows driver in linux.
[06:52] <deCon> billy, qua? why sda2?
[06:52] <function1> if i change my apt sources does that effect where the updates in the update manager come from? (i.e. can i use a mirror to upgrade to feisty??)
[06:52] <Madpilot> billy, sorry, wrong person. :) /opt is in Root - which the file manager in Ubuntu called File System
[06:52] <Frog29> Diabolix - k - where woudl i get the driver though?
[06:53] <darwin> Is there a bittorrent client for Ubuntu that's as good as utorrent?
[06:53] <diabolix> Frog29: did youre pc come with a drivers cd?
[06:53] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: Ethernet controller: Agere Systems ET-131x PCI-E Ethernet Controller (rev 02) <- this b*tch
[06:53] <toddian> mjbrooks: cheers, the exact config is asus a7n, amd64 3000+, 1gb ram, 40gb ide hd as C:, 200gb SATA hd as D:
[06:53] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: it accepted "sudo modprobe 8139too"
=== foolsout is now known as foolsZzz
[06:53] <munkymunkyman> anyone know why when i do "aptitude install glib2.0" it suggest a downgrade and thats the only way it will let me install?
[06:53] <Frog29> Diabolix - nope but windows is installed
[06:53] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: module for your card aint loaded
[06:53] <Shrimpy_> IndyGunFreak: hey hey
[06:53] <Meshezabeel> darwin: azureus
[06:53] <Frog29> Diabolix - and it came with a recovery partition
[06:53] <function1> darwin: ive learned to live with azureus
[06:53] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: now proceed sudo ifconfig eth0 up
[06:53] <toddian> mjbrooks: no floppy, only a dvd burner
[06:53] <billy> deCon, well, honestly that was only an example.  it may read something different.  but you need to know the device name of your /home partition.  sudo fdisk -l in terminal.
[06:53] <diabolix> Frog29: maybe youre manufacturer has a support site with drivers?
[06:53] <function1> darwin: ive heard good things about deluge too. havent tried it.
[06:54] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: yeah, that was for 6.10, does feisty provide it? I had similar problems
[06:54] <Frog29> Diabolix - i hoep so.......
[06:54] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: yeah feisty provides it
[06:54] <billy> Madpilot, :)  I'm sorry dude.   /opt really, truly honestly isn't there.  Can I post a screenshot somewhere?
[06:54] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: have you problems with feisty too man? same problem?
[06:54] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: ok, I'll go into live cd and try to re-grab info
[06:54] <acidtabs> is there a program that would alow you to stream shoutcast radio station?
[06:54] <Frog29> Diabolix - but can i just take a fiel from windows?
[06:54] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: "eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device"
[06:54] <Madpilot> billy, sure, but I don't know why it's missing. Is this a clean install of Ubuntu?
[06:54] <diabolix> Frog29: if you know where it is...
[06:54] <darwin> function1: Azureus never worked right for me. I've had a better experience running utorrent under wine.
[06:54] <billy> Madpilot, yes.
[06:54] <Shrimpy_> can somebody tell me the command line for the xorg config file. to adjust my screen res. thanks!
[06:54] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: lsmod | grep 8139too ?
[06:55] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: that one a also Xorg :) my laptop has a x1400
[06:55] <Frog29> Diabolix - what woudl the ending be?
[06:55] <diabolix> Frog29: i don't know too much about windows.
[06:55] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: that one and also Xorg :) my laptop has a x1400
[06:55] <deepsa> Shrimpy_: sudo nano -w /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:55] <function1> darwin: did it crash a lot?
[06:55] <darwin> no
[06:55] <Frog29> Diabolix - k
[06:55] <Shrimpy_> thanks deepsa
[06:55] <deCon> billy, you mean /dev/sda2 or media/sda2?
[06:55] <deepsa> Shrimpy_: np
[06:55] <diabolix> Frog29: you need a .sys file, and a .inf file. they usually have the same name.
[06:55] <billy> Shrimpy_, because root owns the file you have to prefix with sudo.  sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:55] <Frog29> Diabolix - and? ok.... well let me go get intenret
[06:55] <darwin> function1: Just a little buggy
[06:55] <Meshezabeel> darwin, I would give Azureus another try, works great for me, and without getting into an argument, I'd say in some ways azureus is better than utorrent
=== Patrick__ is now known as rellik
[06:56] <deCon> i love azureus
[06:56] <jlowell> is metisse available for ubuntu?
[06:56] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: I'm now loading feity, I'll try to provide that info again
[06:56] <function1> azureus is much more feature rich, but utorrent is so lite and cute
[06:56] <ap1> My Laptop Intel WLAn chip seems to be off (IBM z69m) indicator light is off. Otherwise, iwconfig shows things seem to be partly ok, but no association. Should the indicator light be on also on Ubuntu? Or is it Windows controlled?
[06:56] <infinityxi> azureus was crapping out on me when it was using sun java 1.5. I had to set it to run on gij
[06:56] <deepsa> s0undt3ch: sure i'll be waiting
[06:56] <billy> deCon, by default, Feisty will want to mount your current /home partition to /media/sda2.  There will be a point int the install process when you will be able to change the mount point to /home.
[06:56] <alienseer23> Q: can anyone provide a link to upgrade features for fiesty?
[06:56] <darwin> Meshezabeel: Azureus has more features but more bloat and sometimes it won't start up at all
[06:56] <s0undt3ch> deepsa: k, Thanks
[06:56] <Shrimpy_> deepsa: i  know there is more of a ui one. do you happen to know it. like x-org somthing. sorry its been a while
[06:57] <function1> arg why does the world keep feisty from me
[06:57] <ccfiel> hello ppl.
[06:57] <bamb1> thanks for the help guys

[06:57] <deepsa> Shrimpy_: screen resolution
[06:57] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: okay let me see
[06:57] <Meshezabeel> darwin, never had a problem with it under ubuntu
[06:57] <mjbrooks> toddian, do you even get anything from the cd?
[06:57] <Shrimpy_> deepsa: yes
[06:57] <deepsa> Shrimpy_: no idea man
[06:57] <mjbrooks> toddian, like the menu?
[06:57] <crdlb> !upgrade | alienseer23
[06:57] <ubotu> alienseer23: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[06:57] <ccfiel> where can i find information nvidia video card that is supported with the restricted driver?
[06:57] <toddian> just an error message saying it was a non-system disc
[06:57] <infinityxi> 4 min remaining on my upgrade
[06:57] <toddian> seem to get that from any boot cd
[06:57] <crdlb> ccfiel, what card?
[06:57] <wm_eddie> Woah.  I can't access my CDrom drive WTF?
[06:57] <Shrimpy_> deepsa: thanks
[06:58] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: module is loaded it should now work try System > Administration > Network and configure the card
[06:58] <deepsa> Shrimpy_: np
[06:58] <crdlb> ccfiel, the restricted manager will do it for you though (in feisty)
[06:58] <deepsa> !language > wm_eddie
[06:58] <commonlyUNIQU3> deepsa: k, hang on
[06:58] <ccfiel> crdlb:  I am planning to buy one. coz my ATI is not supported  :)
[06:58] <darwin> Meshezabeel: I'll probably switch to deluge when it gets more features
[06:58] <deepsa> commonlyUNIQU3: okay
[06:58] <crdlb> ccfiel, what ati?
[06:58] <cyris> ubuntu locos arn't popular up here in canada eh?
[06:58] <cyris> i dont think there is one in my area, or even close to it :S
[06:58] <noname`> Anything else that's kind of fun to use on ubuntu; like beryl? (not a program like beryl, but fun like beryl)
[06:58] <cableroy> Is there a site with 7.04 upgrade problems? i upgraded yesterday but didn't boot correctly
[06:59] <Shrimpy_> IndyGunFreak: hey whats up
[06:59] <diabolix> noname`: doom 3?
[06:59] <crdlb> ccfiel, the full line is supported (from the TNT) but a FX or newer is a good idea
[06:59] <wm_eddie> I got !languaged for an F?
[06:59] <Meshezabeel> darwin: yup, good thing about having a number of different programs, different people have different tastes, and we can all choose the one we like best for ourselves :)
[06:59] <ubuntu> helllo
[06:59] <deepsa> ubuntu hi
[06:59] <deepsa> wm_eddie: yeah
[06:59] <ccfiel> cldlb: my present card is ATI 9250 and its not support with the restricted driver. so i want to buy a new video card and i want its supported with the restricted driver.? any idea?
[06:59] <ubuntu> doesn someone know how to use Yaird to create a initrd ?
[06:59] <wm_eddie> deepsa: Seriously?
[07:00] <deepsa> wm_eddie: you know that man
[07:00] <jd> hello...  I just installed Feisty but I can't see my USB drive when I plug it in.  Is there any bugs that have been heard of lately w/regard to this?
[07:00] <Shrimpy_> does any body know the command line to config xorg soemthing to get the screen resolution
[07:00] <ubuntu> I have just installed yaird, but I dont know how to create initrd with it
[07:00] <deCon> does anyone know about beryl compatibility with feisty? I have to reinstall all my apps and such after upgrade too, right?
[07:00] <umop> deepsa, Hmm, I still dont see where in gparted I can merge the partitions.
[07:00] <RAOF> ccfiel: Your card is supported with the open-source drivers.  Use them!
[07:00] <deepsa> jd lsusb -v please
[07:00] <billy> Madpilot, http://ubuntuforums.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=30163&d=1177045183
[07:00] <deepsa> umop: maybe you not running the latest version
[07:00] <darwin> Does deluge cycle through all the trackers available like in utorrent?
[07:00] <diabolix> some distros even include a program called "wt*"
[07:01] <wm_eddie> Anyone had any problems with their CDROM drive dissapearing?
[07:01] <ccfiel> raof: yes its support but no tv out :( im planning to replace may windows MCE so i need tv out
[07:01] <wm_eddie> like no more /dev/hdb
[07:01] <RAOF> Aaaah.
[07:01] <billy> Madpilot, you'll see me flailing around with thunderbird.  pardon my mess.  :)
[07:01] <deCon> and what is the 64bit good for? I have dualcore amd64, but i heard things are iffy right now due to application development...does that mean i also have to emulate/??? 32bit applications if i install 64 bit? thx
[07:01] <RAOF> ccfiel: Is your card really not supported.  ATI sucks :(
[07:01] <wm_eddie> I only have a /dev/sda
[07:01] <mjbrooks> toddian, you wouldn't happen to have some usb devices plugged into it do you?
[07:02] <toddian> I do actually
[07:02] <toddian> got an ipod plugged in
[07:02] <diabolix> too bad you can't import settings from another distro...
[07:02] <jd> is there a good place to post log files?
[07:02] <toddian> mjbrooks: has that been known to cause problems?
[07:02] <DARKGuy> Hey, I'm installing the new ubuntu and I see something about a migration assistant, allowing me to choose stuff from my Windows drive... could anyone tell me what is this and what it's suppossed to do, and if it's safe to do what it asks?
[07:02] <jd> like some type of file host?
[07:02] <Meshezabeel> jd pastebin.ca ?
[07:02] <Meshezabeel> jd http://pastebin.ca
[07:02] <umop> Does anyone know if gparted 0.2.5 supports merging partitions?
[07:02] <mjbrooks> toddian, some people have said that there are boot issues with devices plugged in to the extended usb ports of that mobo
[07:02] <ccfiel> RAOF: yes ATI sucks. so i want to buy NVidia.  do you an info that shows list the supported and no head ached installed the restricted driver?
[07:03] <toddian> okay, so try unplugging and restarting with it?
[07:03] <diabolix> DARKGuy: it will attempt to import settings from you're windows partition, like bookmarks and email settings.
[07:03] <billy> DARKGuy, contents of C:\Documents and Settings\ (some anyway, pictures, music, etc.)
[07:03] <toddian> also, would it be better to use the amd64 version or i386 version of ubuntu
[07:03] <toddian> cuz I want to run cedega and crossover office
[07:03] <ccfiel> cldb: how about fx 6200? can this be a good video card?
[07:03] <mjbrooks> toddian, yeah, you might also need to actually go further and disable the extended usb in the bios
[07:03] <tom__> is it still ok just to update with a sudo apt-get dist-upgrade on an updated sources.list
[07:03] <jlowell> has anyone used metisse on ubuntu?
[07:03] <ap1> Should I install news firmware on Edgy for my ThinkPad z60m Intel 2916ABG WLAN card? Because it seems to be dead?
[07:03] <DARKGuy> diabolix, billy: I see, thanks. Hopefully this Feisty doesn't have any ntfs writing module so it's safe, right?
[07:04] <nonuda> any1 here use gambas?
[07:04] <billy> DARKGuy, and what diabolix said.
[07:04] <toddian> just an option in the bios?
[07:04] <ubuntu> if I use a amd64 ubuntu, will I be able to play doom3 or quake4 on it?
[07:04] <billy> DARKGuy, not by default, no ntfs writing.
[07:04] <mjbrooks> toddian, I'd use the 386 there are soem issues with 64  like no flash plugins for example
[07:04] <diabolix> DARKGuy: it will mount it read only, you should have nothing to worry about..
[07:04] <tom__> ubuntu: unless you need more than 4 gigs of ram, just use the x86 ubuntu
[07:04] <DARKGuy> Thanks a lot, diabolix & billy :D
[07:04] <billy> DARKGuy, right on.  :)
[07:04] <toddian> yeah that would be a problem, cool. I'm still downloading it but I'll restart and see if the amd 64 cd will at least boot
[07:04] <toddian> brb
[07:05] <mjbrooks> toddian, that's what they say
[07:05] <DARKGuy> What's with the "create an user for importing inside the selected account" ?
[07:05] <deCon> how is software for 64 bit, and does 32 bit software still work fine under 64bitamd?
=== Polygon89 is now known as Polygon|afk
[07:05] <s0undt3ch> dam, how do I mount a pen RW and not just R?
[07:05] <wm_eddie> Doh, my CDROM drive isn't in the hardware information at all >_<
[07:05] <tom__> deCon: i've got a 64 bit amd chip here and i just use 32 bit
[07:05] <billy> DARKGuy, you can set it to be someone other than yourself.  Put your own user name and password in there if you want it for you.
[07:05] <lalala> e296e3468358789904097fc8df29609a  ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
[07:05] <tom__> deCon: no worries at all
[07:05] <lalala> correct?
[07:05] <Ashex> since the main ubuntu repos are being hammered
[07:05] <diabolix> out of curiosity, has anyone tried beryl in vesa mode?
[07:05] <siti> 64bit requires more work but will be faster due to compiler optimizations
[07:05] <tom__> deCon: the only need for 64 bit is if you use more than 4 gigs of ram
[07:06] <darwin> Why do some programs not work well with Compiz?
[07:06] <deCon> tom__, thats what i thought, but is 64bit worth it yet? Cuz i'm on 32bit edgy right now...
[07:06] <Ashex> in theory, if I use the canadian servers, they should be experiencing a lighter load, right?
[07:06] <DARKGuy> billy: But I haven't made any linux user accounts yet. Lemme see... does this creates a new user for importing the windows data in, or does it create a new user in the windows system? I'm kinda confused
[07:06] <tom__> deCon: like i said, only if you need mroe than four gigs of ram
[07:06] <billy> diabolix, yes.  in edgy.  didn't work.
[07:06] <diabolix> darwin: because compiz is under development.
[07:06] <Ax4> i don't think enough applications currently take advantage of 64bit chips
[07:06] <Ax4> :S
[07:06] <deCon> tom__, see ya, cuz my 1gb is fast as hell, but it was overloaded by too much in windows
[07:06] <deCon> tom__, thanks!
[07:06] <tom__> deCon: np :)
[07:06] <Meshezabeel> Ashex, use a torrent
[07:06] <deCon> does beryl work in feisty?
[07:06] <lalala> e296e3468358789904097fc8df29609a  ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso  (md5sum)
[07:06] <billy> DARKGuy, creates new user in ubuntu.  yeah, it's confusing.  just put the same username each time if you want it for yourself.
[07:06] <tom__> deCon: ype
[07:07] <Meshezabeel> deCon: yes, but beryl is still in beta
[07:07] <Ashex> Meshezabeel, I've downloaded the dvd with torrent and I'm currently seeding
[07:07] <Ashex> I'm talking about the repos
[07:07] <DARKGuy> I see, thanks billy :D
[07:07] <siti> Ax4: almost every open source app can be recompiled as a 64bit binary, at the very least ubuntu can allow more optimizations like sse, sse2, and 16 register support
[07:07] <jd> http://pastebin.ca/449378
[07:07] <diabolix> it is kind of nice that you can use irc while installing...
[07:07] <siti> Ax4: benchmarks vary, but I guess it's about 10% faster
[07:07] <tom__> siti: the problem isn't the open source apps, its the closed source one
[07:07] <Ashex> there is currently no true advantage to running a 64-bit system IMO as a desktop
[07:07] <diabolix> livecd+installer in one is awsome.
[07:07] <Ax4> siti: yea definitely  not enough YET :p
[07:07] <siti> tom__: yeah :(
[07:07] <darwin> I don't think it was a good idea to package feisty with compiz since it's still under development
[07:07] <tom__> Axhex: agreed
[07:08] <lalala> e296e3468358789904097fc8df29609a  ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso  (md5sum)?? Correct?
[07:08] <billy> DARKGuy, I just finished using it on my work computer.  Pulled -everything- from my windows account.
[07:08] <zPacKRat> am I the only one with feisty repository issues, as in they don't work.
[07:08] <jlowell> has anyone used metisse on ubuntu?
[07:08] <megafauna> billy: nice
[07:08] <DARKGuy> billy: cool!
[07:08] <diabolix> 64 bit is over rated.. even for things its supposed to be good at.
[07:08] <siti> Ax4: it will never increase in performance, it will only be a must have when many people have 4GB or more as people have said
[07:08] <megafauna> even tuxcart is slow to d/l
[07:08] <Whiz2> anyone in here know anything about configuring the linux package named exim4?
[07:08] <Ashex> sure, it may run a little bit faster, but you don't really get anything out of it
[07:08] <billy> Now it's time to fix the dialup.  :/
[07:08] <tom__> diabolix: it's useful if you need that much ram
[07:08] <Ashex> Servers are the platform that really benefits from it
[07:08] <Ax4> siti: that'll be the day when we need 4gb per desktop workstation.... lol
[07:09] <diabolix> tom__: or if you need >2gb per process.
[07:09] <Ashex> primarily render farms
[07:09] <mkyb14> is anyone having problems with Fiesty and installing it in Parallels on a mac... the screen just goes black after hitting enter for the live cd to boot... there's articles on google but no solutions!!
[07:09] <tom__> diabolix: roger
[07:09] <DARKGuy> Or making 10-100 meters wide images in photoshop :P
[07:09] <diabolix> if linux takes over in time we wont need 4gb.
[07:09] <lalala> c0b53043640a75a7382f79e567a531ac
[07:09] <Ax4> my friend using gentoo idles at 20mb

[07:09] <Ax4> the entire thing!
[07:09] <Ax4> 20mb!
[07:09] <Ax4> ridiculous
[07:09] <lalala> omg sums are soo off
[07:09] <siti> Ax4: I doubt 4gb will be required for a long time, but computers are so much faster when they have more ram, because everything can be cached
[07:09] <lalala> why!!

[07:16] <diabolix> ok.. feisty is installed.. time to reboot.
[07:16] <lalala> =)
[07:16] <Frog29> Diabolix - i'm not sure where to go from there.....
[07:16] <mjbrooks> ianfromsydney, hahaha   well that's different enough to make everything I said pointless... lemme check on that
=== c00l2sv is now known as c00l2sv`away
[07:16] <ianfromsydney> lol yeah, sorry bro
[07:16] <Whiz2> isaac_: howto.org? that just keeps asking for my citty, state, and zip.
[07:16] <Jordan_U> For some reason, no packages that I install, even from main, can be authenticated ( Feisty )
[07:17] <ny83> the iso's available for download were last modified on the 15th - is this supposed to be?
[07:17] <drew> so has anyone had problems with fglrx?
[07:18] <x_> Hello.  I can't get my USB drive to work.  It tells me that I don't have permission to mount it.  Can anyone help me?
[07:18] <wm_eddie> Well it looks like my laptop wont even boot from my 6.10 LiveCD anymore >_<
[07:18] <x_> http://pastebin.ca/449378
[07:18] <Jordan_U> ny83, Yes, unlike some Proprietary OS's, with Ubuntu Release Candidate means just that :)
[07:18] <wm_eddie> When did it break?
[07:18] <Sleeping> Can anyone help me with the wireless that's built into my laptop (HP pavilion dv5000 AMD 64 bit on 7.04)? All the walkthroughs I've found keep failing me.
[07:18] <ny83> means what Jordan_U?
[07:18] <AnAnt> Hello, are the CDs in ShipIt all Desktop or alternate too ?
[07:18] <tom__> oh yeah feisty coming in off my isp mirrors :)
[07:18] <gr3ml1n> hey
[07:18] <SuperMike> This card claims it can do 1080i / 720 p and starts at $90, but it only has Svideo input, hmzzz
[07:18] <Jordan_U> ny83, That it may be exactly what is released :)
[07:19] <wm_eddie> Sleeping: Do you know what driver you have to use?
[07:19] <gr3ml1n> why does ubuntu feisty install english firefox when i select german as language? this SUCKS

[07:19] <ny83> huh
[07:19] <Jordan_U> AnAnt, All Desktop AFIK, unless you order Edubuntu
[07:19] <chowmeined> Does xen create partitions for its guest OSes in files? Or are they partitions on the real disk?
[07:19] <lalala> is there a german firefox?
[07:19] <wm_eddie> gr3ml1n: You need to install firefox's german language pack.
[07:19] <DARKGuy> hey, random question... after I install my feisty system, I can resize the ext3 partition with gparted right?
[07:20] <cableroy> chowmeined, you can choose...
[07:20] <sdfasdfawef> chowmeined: are you using xen?
[07:20] <Jordan_U> lalala, There is a german localization for Firefox

[07:20] <chowmeined> sdfasdfawef: i am considering trying it out
[07:20] <mjbrooks> ianfromsydney, I'd try the alternative cd
[07:20] <sdfasdfawef> ahh
[07:20] <sdfasdfawef> what are your reasons?
[07:20] <wm_eddie> back to doing homework.
[07:20] <sdfasdfawef> for choosing it over vmware
[07:20] <drew> is anyone stuck in same resolution after installing fglrx?
[07:21] <ianfromsydney> mjbrooks: okay, cool

[07:21] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:21] <chowmeined> sdfasdfawef: first its open source, second its paravirtualization which should be faster, third its something new to try out..
[07:21] <isaac_> whiz2: oops i meant howtoforge.com
[07:21] <cables> Hey, is it safe to add the Skype repository, or should I just download the .deb?
[07:21] <Sleeping> wm_eddie: I've tried a couple of different things, but the one that was most recomended by the walkthroughs I read was the netbc564 through ndiswrapper
[07:21] <wiseelben> how are empty lines represented in bash?
[07:21] <sdfasdfawef> chowmeined: what guest os's are you planning on installing?
[07:22] <k1gwb> i'm sure this has been gone over by now but i haven't been here.......virtual box on feisty anyone?  tells me no suitable module for running kernel found.
[07:22] <cables> Madpilot, was there another DCC exploit?
[07:22] <T0uCH> what time it take about to apply the changes after the upgrades?
[07:22] <tom__> cables: i added it, haven't had any problems
[07:22] <nexact> hello all, i'm currently installing ubuntu feisty, I have a 500gb(/dev/sdb), how I am supposed to make my partition ?!
[07:22] <Crypt> does anyone know if it's possible to dual boot OS X and Ubuntu on a powerbook?
[07:22] <Flannel> Crypt: it is
[07:22] <tom__> nexact: accept the defaults
[07:22] <ianfromsydney> mjbrooks: only problem with that is at least he managed to boot off the cd, even if it didn't work
[07:22] <user01> hi when i upgrade, is there a way to get rid of old packages?
[07:22] <nexact> I mean, what size I should put.. automatic give me 10gigs.
[07:22] <j0sh0> has anyone had any success install thunderbird 2 on fiesty final?
[07:22] <chowmeined> sdfasdfawef: at least windows
[07:22] <versix> does anyone have experience configuring apache2.2 in ubuntu server?
[07:22] <Jordan_U> Crypt, Yes, it is. I have done it.
[07:22] <ianfromsydney> mjbrooks: I can't even get that far, no boot cd will boot on my system, ms, linux, anything
[07:22] <nexact> tom__: it uses only 10 gigs...
[07:22] <DARKGuy> hey, random question... after I install my feisty system, I can resize the ext3 partition with gparted right?
[07:22] <Madpilot> cables, earlier today, apparently
[07:23] <k1gwb> resizing with gparted never works for me
=== lalala is now known as ExpositionOfEvil
[07:23] <cables> Madpilot, yeah there was, right after release in #ubuntu-release-party. I thought maybe there was another right now 'cause i saw you unbanning people.
[07:23] <user01> should i do a clean install from edgy?
[07:23] <DARKGuy> =/
[07:23] <k1gwb> anyone have any thought on the virtual box thing?
[07:23] <DARKGuy> what about it?
[07:23] <mjbrooks> ianfromsydney, the only thing I can think of is that maybe your dvd writer is having trouble    try stealing you roommates CD drive temporarily
[07:23] <chowmeined> so with xen using the processor extensions.. can I use regular drivers in windows? Like.. can I do nvidia 3D drivers if I have an nvidia card?
[07:23] <myUserName> I need a little help i am running 64bit feisty and nvidia drivers for my 7600 wont work i have managed to disable them and i am now using the drivers NV driver when i change driver i get a black screen (never changes) I have a feeling this problem is quite common is there a fix for it yet?

[07:23] <Madpilot> k1gwb, pastebin!
[07:24] <ianfromsydney> okay, I'll see what I can do. Cheers mate
[07:24] <k1gwb> oooh sorry didn't know that would go on separate lines like that!!
[07:24] <mjbrooks> !paste > k1gwb
[07:24] <DARKGuy> Weird, virtualbox always worked for me
[07:24] <Kickersny> myUserName, I've got a 7600 on 32bit and it's fine
[07:24] <Jordan_U> ianfromsydney, Can your comp boot from USB, and if so do you have a Thumb drive?
[07:24] <j0sh0> has anyone had any success install thunderbird 2 on fiesty final?
[07:24] <Madpilot> cables, yes, we banforward anyone dropped by a D C C  attack to #ubuntu-read-topic
[07:24] <nexact> considering I have /dev/hda, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb, on which partition should I install my MBR ? /dev/sda will hold linux.
[07:24] <DARKGuy> maybe you don't have the kernel sources or libraries or headers or anything to compile source with and it didn't compile a kernel module for virtualbox and that's why it's not finding it?
[07:24] <deCon> myUserName, and i have a 7800 on 32 just fine..must be 64
[07:24] <myUserName> Kickersny, yeah i figured 64bit was the part causing the bug
[07:24] <Crypt> Jordan_U: how well does ubuntu run on a dual booting system?
[07:25] <cables> Madpilot, yeah, I know... that's why I was wondering. Isn't that sorta thing a pretty easily bot-able task?
[07:25] <vega-> nexact: mbr is not "on a partition", it's in the beginning of a harddisk
[07:25] <myUserName> I have read a few other people have had similar problems in google but its to early to get a proper fix for it so far I think (at least via google)
[07:25] <vega-> nexact: /dev/hda would be a good guess
[07:25] <Madpilot> cables, we try not to give bots op powers, as a general rule
[07:25] <Jordan_U> Crypt, Just fine, you will not be able to get 3D acceleration unless you have an ATi card though.
[07:25] <nexact> vega-: /dev/hda is windows(I'll wipe it eventually ;})
[07:25] <cables> Madpilot, ah, makes sense.
[07:25] <nexact> vega-: so /dev/hda is (hd0) ?
[07:25] <Crypt> well i do have an ATI card so i'm good on that end
[07:25] <vega-> nexact: should be on the drive that the bios is set to boot from
[07:26] <Jordan_U> nexact, You should install to whatever drive you are set to boot from
[07:26] <DaSkreech> is there a PS3 Cd for Ubutnu?
[07:26] <nexact> vega-: ok, thanks.
[07:26] <DaSkreech> Ubuntu
[07:26] <k1gwb> hey some people were saying upgrading in place would not work from edgy to feisty if a lot of third party stuff was installed....fwiw i've used easy ubuntu, automatix, beryl, lots of others on edgy and my in place upgrade was FLAWLESS and beautiful
[07:26] <nexact> I had an grub error 17 earlier...
[07:26] <Jordan_U> DaSkreech, I believe so
[07:26] <mjbrooks> Madpilot, yeah, cause if ubotu had op powers it'd ban all of us and the channel would be empty  ;)
[07:26] <billy> k1gwb, awesome!
[07:26] <Flannel> DaSkreech: that'd be PPC I believe.  There's probably a side-project somewhere
[07:26] <vega-> nexact: so if the first hd the bios tries is /dev/sda put it (grub i presume) there
[07:26] <deCon> klgwb, good to know! doing it right now!!!
[07:26] <Madpilot> mjbrooks, something like that :)
[07:26] <DaSkreech> Jordan_U: Official?
[07:27] <rpedro> what is the channel max so far??
[07:27] <DaSkreech> Flannel: that's not maintained
[07:27] <Jordan_U> DaSkreech, No
[07:27] <Sleeping> oh, didn't even notice wm_eddie left. Can someone help me out with my built-in wireless card in my hp pavilion dv5000 laptop on 7.04? I haven't been able to get anything to work yet.
[07:27] <DaSkreech> Jordan_U: soo not on the mirror servers?
[07:27] <Madpilot> rp__, we got over 1400 at one pont
[07:27] <Madpilot> point, even
[07:27] <Jordan_U> DaSkreech, AFIK only yellow Dog is official for PS3
[07:27] <ExpositionOfEvil> wow
[07:27] <Crypt> Jordan_U: how well would my airport extreme card under feisty? for instance would i be able to turn my airport card on and off and be able to fully connect to networks?
[07:27] <rpedro> nice:) forgot to come and look
[07:27] <k1gwb>  yeah i'm thrilled...that's with kubuntu and ubuntu desktop and beryl and so much stuff installed and i just rebooted and it was so nice....only thing is virtualbox doesn't workj with the 2.6.20-15 kernel it seems...no other problems
[07:28] <acidtabs> Is there a streamTurner in festiy
[07:28] <DaSkreech> Jordan_U: there was a PS3 iso on the servers a few weeks back
[07:28] <k1gwb> i wonder how many downloads so far? any way to know?
[07:28] <DaSkreech> bimberi: I say 1570+
[07:28] <Malachi> I just updated, and I want to see what the default session splash looks like, but I had a custom one before I upgraded.
[07:28] <ubunt1> THis is bad UBuntu
[07:28] <ubunt1> i download ubuntu altern cd
[07:28] <mjbrooks> k1gwb, I stopped counting at 20 because I ran out of toes!
[07:28] <Jordan_U> Crypt, Yup, just install bcm43xx-fwcutter and it will automatically download the firmware for your card
[07:28] <ap1> who do i delete ramdisk I made? No freeramdisk?
[07:28] <Crypt> alrightfile:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html
[07:28] <ubunt1> and when i upgrade it say that need to download 487 mb
[07:28] <Crypt> bah
[07:28] <Crypt> alright
[07:28] <ubunt1> bad for you
[07:29] <Crypt> first i gotta dual boot ubuntu
[07:29] <bimberi> DaSkreech: k, it was about 1480 when I went to bed
[07:29] <vega-> Malachi: it was update-alternatives --config <some-package-i-dont-remember>
[07:29] <k1gwb> i had to download ove ra gig and a half to upgrade in place cause i have kde xfce and gnome desktops all installed
[07:29] <Crypt> Jordan_U: any specific documentation on installing and dual booting?
[07:29] <deCon> how can i burn a .img to bootable CD?
[07:29] <DaSkreech> so no PS3 ubuntu ISO then?
[07:29] <ExpositionOfEvil> I got like a gig log of the party yesterday

[07:30] <Crypt> i'm on a ppc machine...powerbook
[07:31] <ExpositionOfEvil> there has to be a ppc image

[07:31] <Crypt> DaSkreech: there ya go
[07:31] <Malachi> rpedro: Thanks.
[07:31] <DaSkreech> You can't upgrade from dapper to feisty right?
[07:32] <k1gwb> no you have to through edgy first
[07:32] <Madpilot> DaSkreech, not without hitting Edgy first
[07:32] <DaSkreech> ok
[07:32] <function1> ok, i plan on using apt-cdrom to use my iso to upgrade to feisty. can i still use the simple gui upgrade to do this, or will i have to use apt-get dist-upgrade from the command line (ubuntu.com warned against this)
[07:32] <DaSkreech> cool
[07:32] <letronje> hi i have downloaded the fiesty iso, can i speed up my upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 using the iso image without burning a disc
[07:32] <DaSkreech> but will you be able to go LTS -> LTS ?
[07:32] <Jordan_U> Crypt, There is stuff that that page doesn't cover, let me try to find a more complete guide...
[07:32] <Jtkiefer> ouch, that's going to suck for people who haven't upgraded from dapper
[07:32] <DaSkreech> or LTS +1 ?
[07:32] <siti> letronje: mount the iso?
[07:32] <k1gwb> you can mount the iso as a virtual cdrom
[07:32] <letronje> and then ?
[07:32] <Jordan_U> letronje, Only if you downloaded the alternate install CD
[07:32] <Jtkiefer> just doing a whole iso install to update is probably easy
[07:32] <letronje> ok
[07:33] <bimberi> letronje: was it the alternate?  you can't upgrade using the desktop cd
[07:33] <siti> it was the desktop one ;)
[07:33] <Flannel> Jordan_U, DaSkreech: no it's not.  Edgy supports PPC as well.

[07:49] (jessid/#ubuntu) some of you know how to use a usb to serial converter in ubuntu? i have a keyspan device and they say that they support their divers in Linux, but recommend to change distro to red hat or fedora...jejeje...that would be the last thing I would do...and also say that it is recommended to recompile the kernel with their dirver..g.some one knows what to do? Thanks! Sorry for the looong story
[07:49] <ubuntu> SHAME FOR UBUNTU 7
[07:50] (bimberi/#ubuntu) aussieaubs: hard to say.  Upgrades have been tested of course but things are so slow since the release that it's hard to know how many successful ones have been done in userland.
[07:50] <ubuntu> i download alternate cd
[07:50] (kcowolf/#ubuntu) Jordan-U: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16500/
[07:50] (billy/#ubuntu) DARKGuy, is the device that ubuntu's on listed in your BIOS?
[07:50] (neo_/#ubuntu) I want install beryl... xD
[07:50] <ubuntu> and it say that i need to download 485mb
[07:50] (DARKGuy/#ubuntu) billy: yes
[07:50] (RantingHuman/#ubuntu) Flannel: Ok. I didn't add my user to the admin group. Will try doing so now. Syntax?
[07:50] <ubuntu> and if someone don't have internet
[07:50] (deCon/#ubuntu) it isn't downloading anythign through update..and i got the ISO, but no CD, any advice?
[07:50] <ubuntu> he will fuck off himself
[07:50] (siti/#ubuntu) robin: rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/compiz/ && sudo killall gconfd-2
[07:50] <RantingHuman> Flannel: Not sure about the OEM user, will try that
[07:50] <ubuntu> i spend 4 hours to download alternate cd
[07:50] <Jordan_U> !ohmy | ubuntu
[07:50] <ubotu> ubuntu: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[07:50] <Noldoaran> where is sudo's log file?
[07:50] <darkhack> would be great is someone would setup an alternative repo server
[07:51] <Flannel> RantingHuman: usermod -G admin -a username
[07:51] <nomasteryoda> ubuntu, how about a wireless connection somewhere/
[07:51] <jessid>  !ohmy
[07:51] <kcowolf> ohmy... nice command...
[07:51] <ubuntu> and now i need to spend another 4 hours to download
[07:51] <jessid> !ohmy
[07:51] <bimberi> Noldoaran: /var/log/auth.log
[07:51] <robin> robin@robin-desktop:~$ rm -r ~/.gconf/apps/compiz/ && sudo killall gconfd-2rm: cannot remove `/home/robin/.gconf/apps/compiz/': No such file or directory
[07:51] <Flannel> RantingHuman: but, try logging in with the OEM user.  since, that sounds eerily like the OEM install
[07:51] <ubuntu> what wireless????
[07:51] <zachwlewis> Here's another question for you guys. I just installed 7.04 on a new hard disk (IDE_PRI master) and moved my DVD-RW (IDE_SEC master). My Windows drive is an SATA. I got the dual-booting working, but since installing Ubuntu, my Windows has been crapping out on me, even though I "shouldn't have" done anything to change it.
[07:51] <Noldoaran> bimberi: thanks
[07:51] <aussieaubs> dell-net: thanks mate
[07:51] <ubuntu> are you good
[07:51] <billy> deCon, what you're wanting to do is called a "Knoppix install."
[07:51] <bimberi> Noldoaran: yw :)
=== Kickersny is now known as KNY[yawn] 
[07:51] <ubuntu> Shame
[07:51] <Meshezabeel> tarzeau: gargantua gorilla
[07:51] <Flannel> darkhack: there are tons of mirrors
[07:51] <lungan> nawk: error while loading shared libraries: libm.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directoryx what is my problem?
[07:51] <aussieaubs> bimberi: thanks for that...i guess patience is the key here
[07:51] <siti> robin: hmm, I don't know
[07:51] <deCon> billy, whys that?
[07:51] <nomasteryoda> some err mod here .. ??
[07:51] <RantingHuman> Flannel: Right-ho. Will go try it now, but first will try logging with OEM. I'm pretty sure I didn't opt for the OEM install (it was the second option, right?)
[07:51] <ubuntu> now if someone want to install UBuntu 7 he need to have internet
[07:52] <billy> deCon, boot from iso image.
[07:52] <bimberi> aussieaubs: yep :)
[07:52] <robin> Guys, how do i remove something from my gconf database?
[07:52] <Alfonzo> im not able to authenticate the katapult install via the package manager...is that normal or should i be alarmed?
[07:52] <Crypt> Jordan_U: just found this pretty awesome guide for dual booting without having to re-install OS X http://blogs.sun.com/richb/entry/powerbook_dual_boot:_macosx_tiger
[07:52] <DARKGuy> billy: do you know how to fix the grub error 21?
[07:52] <ubuntu> becouse he need to download 481 mb
[07:52] <deCon> billy, update is working :D.
[07:52] <Crypt> plus it's using the same hardware as mine iin the installation
[07:52] <Flannel> ubuntu: no.  You don't need to have the internet.  If you do, it'll download updated pafckages, but you don't ened it.
[07:52] <ubuntu> why ubuntu.com say that
[07:52] <ubuntu> LIe
[07:52] <ubuntu> Flannel
[07:52] <darkhack> <Flannel> u think u can direct me to some of them?
[07:52] <ap1> !kernel
[07:52] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[07:52] <kcowolf> ubuntu: I just installed from the regular CD without having to download anything from the Internet.
[07:52] <ubuntu> do you wan to show you
[07:52] <billy> DARKGuy, mine was fixed by editing my DIOS to include my slave drive.
[07:52] <alex22> i put the cd in
[07:52] <Flannel> !mirror | darkhack
[07:52] <ubotu> darkhack: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[07:52] <DARKGuy> billy: in mine, it's included and working :/
[07:52] <alex22> and it doesn't load to the live cd.. it stays stuck @ the loading screen
[07:52] <DARKGuy> oh well
[07:52] <ubuntu> kcowolf man in the moment i installed from alternated cd
[07:52] <alex22> how do i boot w/ verbose
[07:53] <Flannel> ubuntu: disconnect your computer from the internet, and install.  I guarentee it'll work.
[07:53] <darkhack> <Flannel> yes
[07:53] <ubuntu> Flannel i try and if fail to install
[07:53] <Jordan_U> Crypt, I would suggest using a program like Super Duper or Carbon Copy Cloner before trying to resize HFS+
[07:53] <ubuntu> Flannel do you have something another to say.
[07:53] <siti> alex22: alt + f1 might work
[07:53] <kcowolf> jordan_U: saw my other pastebin?
[07:53] <Tarkus> hey, i just installed ubuntu 7.04 5 minutes ago, and it doesnt look like my video drivers are installed. im new to linux and dont know the right way to get graphics drivers, im using an NVidia GeForce 7800GT. and my displays res is 1680x1050, and i dont see that resolution when i try to change it. any ideas? thanks
[07:54] <RantingHuman> OEM login doesn't work
[07:54] <mjbrooks> !nvidia > Tarkus
[07:54] <gr3ml1n> hi
[07:54] <kjking02> I have a computer that has basically been completely cleaned, with a linux swap, a reiserfs, and an unallocated partition, when i put in the ubuntu live cd, i get an error that says "no screens found"
[07:54] <robin> How do I remove the Compiz configuration out of my gconf database?
[07:54] <Dell-Net> Tarkus: hello u must add resolutions in /etc/xorg.conf file
[07:54] <deCon> billy, how can i boot from iso, this is taking too long
[07:54] <Flannel> ubuntu: You probably have a bad burn.  I guarentee it works.  Did you check the CD for defects?
[07:54] <siti> robin: is it global, or just your user?
[07:54] <robin> siti, just my user
[07:54] <Jordan_U> kcowolf, I hadn't but now I do
[07:54] <TommyTom> i have no top or bottom bar in xubuntu 7.04. surely this in not a new "feature" for the live cd
[07:54] <ubuntu> Flannel yes i check the dvd for defects
[07:55] <gr3ml1n> when i write 85-85 at the vert refresh section of xorg.conf monitor section i can only choose 800x600 and 640x480 but i want 1024x768@85 hz what do i have to enter?
[07:55] <siti> robin: well that command should have done it, if it still existed
[07:55] <darkhack> anyway, great work on Feisty
[07:55] <ubuntu> i burn the cd-image on dvd-image
[07:55] <mjbrooks> deCon, you can't boot from iso, you have to burn the iso to a CD and boot rom that
[07:55] <robin> siti, well, if i do a gconftool-editor, i still see the Compiz directory.
[07:55] <Dell-Net> !nvidia
[07:55] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[07:55] <nomasteryoda> Dell-Net,  not with the latest nvidia drivers... and their nvidia-xconfig script... it should do that if nvidia-glx is installed
[07:55] <ubuntu> becouse i don't have cd
[07:55] <darkhack> I'm looking forward to the nex releases
[07:55] <Flannel> RantingHuman: very odd.  Well, keep an eye on stuff.  If stuff is acting oddly, it might be because the installer didn't finish all the way.
[07:55] <billy> deCon, you're upgrading now?
[07:55] <Dell-Net> nomasteryoda: realy?
[07:55] <deCon> jbrooks, right, but i have no cd
[07:55] <nomasteryoda> yup
[07:55] <deCon> billy, trying, however it is stuck on 48 of 70 pieces
[07:55] <siti> robin: try killall gconfd-2
[07:56] <petafile> Anyone here ever get errors from apt-get about not being able to find method drivers in /usr/lib/apt? (specifically htt, whihc I probably mispelled somewhere, and should be http)
[07:56] <deCon> billy, nevermind, its on 52 now..i guess the server load is tremendous, ill come back in a bit
[07:56] <darkhack> Yall have a good night now
[07:56] <tristanmike> Hello, I've just installed Feisty (I love it btw), and I'm trying to get DVD playback but I can't find the libdvdcss2 package, can someone give me a quick hand please and thanx
[07:56] <ubuntu> now ubuntu 7 say that need to download 1498 files
[07:56] <gr3ml1n> when i write 85-85 at the vert refresh section of xorg.conf monitor section i can only choose 800x600 and 640x480 but i want 1024x768@85 hz what do i have to enter?
[07:56] <billy> deCon, yeah man.  they're bogged totally.  just relax.
[07:56] <ubuntu> that are 485 mb
[07:56] <Jordan_U> kcowolf, I don't know what to tell you, everything looks to be fine, the only thing I can think or is that the Refresh rates might be incorrect
[07:56] <mjbrooks> deCon, yes, it is tremendous at the moment
[07:56] <robin> siti, The compiz directory is still there
[07:56] <ubuntu> in the start of the install from the cd i press no
[07:56] <CrippledCanary> tristanmike: You shouldn't have to
[07:56] <ubuntu> and it again start to download from internete
[07:56] <kcowolf> Jordan_U: one sec
[07:57] <ubuntu> internet.
[07:57] <deCon> billy, i can understand, this is one hot pancake lol. i'm hoping to revamp an old p2 with this tonight
[07:57] <Absolt> hey guys, do you think I would have better luck here or on the forums for installation probs?
[07:57] <siti> robin: well I think it's just that you have compiz installed so it's the global default configuration...
[07:57] <siti> which should be fine
[07:57] <deCon> Absolt, definately here....
[07:57] <CrippledCanary> tristanmike: All I did was to when I opened a mp3 I got a question about searching for codecs.
[07:57] <robin> siti, no, the keys in my gconf won't vanish..
[07:57] <bobrik> Hi, update-manager crashed during upgrade edgy->feisty  -   I just wonder if "sudo apt --configure -a" and then running update-manager again is equivalent substitute to upgrading properly
[07:57] <mneptok> Absolt: you should buy a support contract from Canonical ;)
[07:57] <kcowolf> Jordan_U: (II) NVIDIA(0): Not using mode "1024x768" (no mode of this name)
[07:57] <Jordan_U> TommyTom, Try pressing alt+f2 and running killall gnome-panel
[07:57] <CrippledCanary> tristanmike: Just select all of the suggested ones.
[07:57] <kcowolf> Jordan_U: from my Xorg.0.log
[07:57] <ubuntu> bobrik Ubuntu 7 is shame
[07:57] <delmorep> Hey Guys! If I upgraded to the Fiesty beta a few weeks ago, do I have to do anything to get the "OFFICIAL" Fiesty, or will it automatically update to the final released version?
[07:57] <siti> robin: well try syaptic and try and remove any sign of compiz being installd
[07:57] <gr3ml1n> when i write 85-85 at the vert refresh section of xorg.conf monitor section i can only choose 800x600 and 640x480 but i want 1024x768@85 hz what do i have to enter?
[07:57] <robin> siti, i did the desktop effects and it worked fine. Then i clicked on 'GL Desktop' in my Preferences and THAT screwed up my Compiz configuration.
[07:57] <deCon> billy, "failed to fetch" errors left and right, 4 of them
[07:58] <tristanmike> CrippledCanary; I didn't try a dvd yet, lemme see...
[07:58] <mneptok> delmorep: no. just update your beta.
[07:58] <Absolt> awesome, I've been trying to get ubuntu all the way from LTS and now im trying with fawn and I cant get the install cd to boot
[07:58] <robin> oh, but it works alright now again..
[07:58] <Crypt> Justin_U: I used that guide and backed up before with iBackup for Edgy a long time ago. I'm just curious if it will work for feisty
[07:58] <Flannel> ubuntu: those are updates to the packages you currently have, since theyre old
[07:58] <robin> Thanks for the help :)
[07:58] <Jordan_U> delmorep, You will automatically get the final
[07:58] <Absolt> it starts booting, and then my screen just blanks out
[07:58] <delmorep> AWESOME!
[07:58] <mneptok> Absolt: what error do you get?
[07:58] <delmorep> thats so cool
[07:58] <Absolt> and my monitor loses signal
[07:58] <gr3ml1n> when i write 85-85 at the vert refresh section of xorg.conf monitor section i can only choose 800x600 and 640x480 but i want 1024x768@85 hz what do i have to enter?
[07:58] <Absolt> no error
[07:58] <ubuntu> Flannel nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

[07:58] <ubuntu> Flannel man think,think
[07:59] <AzMoo> Hey, I just did the distupgrade to feisty. It all went through fine, except after restart I don't have an X server anymore. The X log tells me that the nvidia module wasn't loaded. How come?
[07:59] <mneptok> Absolt: have you tried with the alternate CD?
[07:59] <mjbrooks> !enter > Absolt
[07:59] <robin> siti, well, i upgraded from Edgy to Feisty.. and then it appeared
[07:59] <ubuntu> Flannel why ubuntu.com say that gksu "sh cdrom/cdromupgrad" will upgrade from the cd
[07:59] <ExpositionOfEvil> If I were you id install by cd =/
[07:59] <Absolt> I tried the alt with 6.10
[07:59] <mneptok> AzMoo: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
[07:59] <Pitel> will i be able to install ubuntu on a computer with less than 256 MB ram with 7.04 desktop cd?
[07:59] <Absolt> havent tried fawn alt
[07:59] <Jordan_U> ubuntu, That is only from the alternate install CD , not the Desktop install
[07:59] <Flannel> ubuntu: Oh.  You're upgrading?  You didn't say that.
[07:59] <ubuntu> it start,but then wirhout internet it say that fail to download.
[07:59] <zachwlewis> Yay! Wobble windows!
[07:59] <Jordan_U> Pitel, Yes
[07:59] <siti> Pitel: it says the min is 192MB with desktop cd
[08:00] <Absolt> i have an ati x800 vivo if that helps at all :\
[08:00] <tristanmike> CrippledCanary: It gave me an error, it said "Cannot Read From Source"....The Support documentation suggests to install a few packages but I can't find the "libdvdcss2" package....any ideas ?
[08:00] <fluid> yay white screen when i start beryl...blegh. got 2d/3d working on this radeon m200 tho hehe
[08:00] <mjbrooks> Absolt, is it a laptop?
[08:00] <ubuntu> Jordan_U i have i have alternativeeeeeeee
[08:00] <siti> or less withe the alt
[08:00] <AzMoo> mneptok: nvidia-glx is already the latest version.
[08:00] <zachwlewis> QUERY: How can I change my username?
[08:00] <mneptok> Absolt: get the alt CD via BitTorrent so the download is not corrupted in some way. burn it at the slowest speed possible.
[08:00] <zachwlewis> QUERY: How can I add 1280x1024 as a resolution?
[08:00] <Absolt> yup, md5 checks
[08:00] <robin> siti, well, i upgraded from Edgy to Feisty.. and then it appeared
[08:00] <Absolt> and internal check checks
[08:00] <ubuntu> Flannel ??? i say it .I have ubuntu 6.10 and i want to install UBuntu 7
[08:00] <humblerodent> I got Feisty Fawn already.  =)  the only problem I have so far is that my available monitor refresh rates are screwy.  It correctly detected my ViewSonic A70 (yeah, I know it's old) as it always has in past versions.  But with a resolution of 1280x1024, I can only get a refresh rate of 50 hz, which is not at all pleasant.  Turning down the resolution doesn't give me much improvement in refresh rate options....I've never had this issue bef
[08:00] <humblerodent> ore.  Can I get any help?  Thanks in advance.
[08:00] <mneptok> AzMoo: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic
[08:00] <ubuntu> Flannel but i install it from UBuntu 7 alternative cd
[08:00] <TommyTom> well the bars arent that big of a problem (if its just the LIVE cd part). right now i need to figure out how to make a extended partition over my 20gb (guide says i cant ahve more than 4 partition. i have 2 NTFS on same RAID array)
[08:00] <Jordan_U> ubuntu, Ok, is the CD mounted in /cdrom?
[08:00] <pibarnas> compiz show desktop plugin isn't working on feisty.
[08:00] <ubuntu> Flannel why i need to download from internet
[08:01] <siti> robin: well I don't know :S, my guess is some how a program has made you use xgl which screws up a aiglx compiz...
[08:01] <ubuntu> Jordan_U it is mounted
[08:01] <ubuntu> JOrdan_U i see the light green
[08:01] <mjbrooks> TommyTom, you can't have more than 4 primamry partitions
[08:01] <kernel06> couldn't figure out my airlink wireless pcmcia work.
[08:01] <bimberi> ubuntu: is your Edgy installation up to date?
[08:01] <Flannel> ubuntu: After your computer is booted, put the CD in.  You should get a prompt asking if you want to upgrade
[08:01] <AzMoo> mneptok: ah hah! That looks more promising. Thanks.
[08:01] <CrippledCanary> tristanmike: Do you have a mp3 file somewhare? Try to trig the automatic codec installation with that.
[08:01] <ExpositionOfEvil> whats the problem with ubuntus resolutions and refresh rates =(
[08:01] <robin> siti, no, i use AIGLX, but there's that "GL Desktop" in my Preferences menu. It has advanced options to configure Compiz but if you run it it sets all the Compiz configuration to it's own liking, thus screwing it up.
[08:01] <ubuntu> bimberi MY ubuntu 6.10 was up-to date
[08:02] <Absolt> so any ideas guys?
[08:02] <Jordan_U> ubuntu, What happens when you try to run: gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrad" ?

[08:03] <deCon> Do i need to add extra repositories for things such as wine, beryl etc to work through the upgrade?

[08:03] <kcowolf> Looks like I'm set at 60 Hz in "Screen Resolution", but 1024x768 doesn't appear on the dropdown list

[08:07] <Flannel> ubuntu: alright.  Take the DVD out of the drive and put it back in, you should get a prompt asking if you want to upgrade to feisty
[08:07] <mjbrooks> TommyTom, basicall it makes sure stuff is written to the disk better than a non-journaled fs    that's the very basic of answers ;)
[08:07] <bytecolor> zachwlewis, look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:08] <ubuntu> Flannel i try and nothing happend
[08:08] <Ademan> TommyTom: thanks, but its sorta hanging, i guess the server really is down...
[08:08] <shibz> Hi, I installed ubuntu 6.10 a while ago, today I tried to upgrade to 7 and it told me I was out of disk space on /boot. I fixed that, but now it is trying to upgrade me to 6.10 even though I already have 6.10
[08:08] <Whisperkiller> ive tried reading that first link and it didnt help
[08:08] <Whisperkiller> im on a livecd
[08:08] <Jordan_U> Whisperkiller, Do you use RAID?
[08:08] <Whisperkiller> i cant boot into the install so the stuff i tried off that link wouldnt work
[08:08] <Whisperkiller> no just a plain old ide
[08:08] <ubuntu> Flannel is there some command to force not to download from internet.
[08:08] <TommyTom> ademan: yes i know, ubuntu.com is getting hit hard. its should load eventually. id give a link to a post i made but its not a public forum

[08:09] <Flannel> ubuntu: gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade"  should do it.
[08:09] <Jordan_U> Whisperkiller, Why won't the stuff in that link work, it is meant for a LiveCD?
[08:09] <mjbrooks> shibz, I believe your 6.10 has to be up-to-date before it can do the 6.10->7.04 transition
[08:09] <Ademan> TommyTom: :-/ that's too bad, sounds like one of the most popular releases yet is gonna leave a bad taste in new users' mouths...
[08:09] <ubuntu> Flannel man i tell you that this command i press no and again start to download from internet
[08:09] <Whisperkiller> ill look again
[08:09] <shibz> my 6.10 is pretty much up to date... this thing wants me to download 1000+ packages!!!
[08:09] <Flannel> ubuntu: what do you mean you press no?  What does it ask you?
[08:09] <ubuntu> Flannel it fetching and after 960 it start to download
[08:09] <Ademan> current ubuntu users worth anything should be using the torrents and seeding...

[08:10] <morfys> hi everyone..
[08:10] <ubuntu> Flannel it ask in the begging do yo want your system to be upgraded with latest updates
=== docMuerto is now known as doc|
[08:10] <Jordan_U> shibz, That is normall, everything on your system is being upgraded
[08:10] <Evangeline> Hello there !
[08:10] <ubuntu> Flannel and i press no
[08:10] <Flannel> ubuntu: why don't you hit yes?
[08:10] <shibz> Jordan_U, it says its upgrading to 6.10 though
[08:10] <ubuntu> Flannel becouse it want internet
[08:10] <morfys> I was just trying to upgrade my distro to fiesty.. noticed that while installing edgy, I created a /boot of only 32Mb..
[08:10] <mjbrooks> shibz, that sounds like it's doing the 6.10->7.04   are you sure it's trying to install 6.10?
[08:10] <ubuntu> Flannel i have alternated cd
[08:10] <Jordan_U> shibz, Are you running Dapper currently?
[08:10] <morfys> now I require more space for the upgrade..
[08:11] <shibz> Yes
[08:11] <TommyTom> ademan: give me the exact releases you want (64bit? desktop? alternate? xubuntu?) and i can get them for you
[08:11] <Flannel> ubuntu: Have you ever tried pushing yes?
[08:11] <ubuntu> Flannel and that mean to install it without internet
[08:11] <jessid> i will go to sleep as neo_ I am also colombian and here is 1:10 am...good bye and thanks a lot!
[08:11] <Evangeline> I went from 6.10 trough 7.04 with 295Mbs of downloads by the updater...
[08:11] <Jordan_U> shibz, That is normal, you need to go Egdy -> Feisty
[08:11] <ubuntu> Flannel yes and it start first to upgrade from internet.
[08:11] <tarnap_> good morning dudes
[08:11] <Ademan> TommyTom: i386 desktop ubuntu and xubuntu torrents
[08:11] <American-Tech_> I am looking for help finding the windows wireless driver for my laptop Gateway mx6448. I want ti install ndiswrapper and use the driver
[08:11] <shibz> err actually I am edgy
[08:11] <zachwlewis> ...rebooting X froze my computer.
[08:11] <shibz> I get names confused
[08:11] <zachwlewis> I got stuck on some black screen.
[08:11] <jpsamara> Which java do you recomend... sun5 or sun6 ?] 
[08:11] <morfys> so I unmounted /boot copying all the files, to tmp and then copying back all the boot files to /boot which now existed as a directory on my /
[08:11] <shibz> edgy = 6.10 right?
[08:11] <shibz> I am at 6.10
[08:11] <Flannel> ubuntu: pastebin your sources.list, I want to take a llook at it
[08:11] <morfys> yup

[08:12] <Jordan_U> shibz, Yes, Edgy is 6.10
[08:12] <ubuntu> Flannel ok,tell me what to do to pastebin
[08:12] <piaoyu_> test
[08:12] <Evangeline> zachlewis... try editing your Xorg.conf
[08:12] <Flannel> ubuntu: also, like I said originally, simply disconnecting the machine from the internet will make it so it *cant* get internet stuff
[08:12] <morfys> I have removed all the boot related lines from /etc/fstab..
[08:12] <Flannel> !paste | ubuntu
[08:12] <ubotu> ubuntu: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:12] <Evangeline> Put "Vesa" as your VGA

[08:12] <zachwlewis> Evangeline: Where can I find Xorg.conf?
[08:12] <Evangeline> That should make the trick for a while
[08:12] <Flannel> ubuntu: /etc/apt/sources.list, copy it all, paste it into that webpage, hit submit, come back ehre with the URL
[08:12] <tarnap_> can someone tell me how to mount fsftp using ftp active mode?
[08:12] <navreet> what's going on with feisty?

[08:13] <dibblego> Jordan_U, thanks
[08:13] <bayziders> Fiesty feels the same as edgy but if I had a laptop im sure I would be thanking god
[08:13] <morfys> is there anything else that I need to take care of before rebooting the system to test the new settings ?
[08:13] <morfys> please help
[08:13] <shibz> I had to unmount my /boot... could that have anything to do with it being seen as dapper instead of edgy?
[08:13] <navreet> bayziders, why is that?
[08:13] <mjbrooks> bayziders, I know I am  ;)
[08:13] <Dell-Net> I like feisty its faster
[08:13] <Ademan> thanks a lot TommyTom
[08:13] <navreet> can anyone download feisty? my software update screen isn't downloading
[08:13] <bayziders> Cause nothing feels diffrent and my boot time is slower =/
[08:13] <shibz> I did a cp -R /boot /newboot && umount /boot && mv /newboot /boot
[08:13] <zachwlewis> Where do I add "1280x1024"?
[08:13] <cornucopia> feisty is awsome
[08:14] <bayziders> But why?
[08:14] <morfys> it is working for me.. but I have a bad feeling that I am going to mess up the system real bad
[08:14] <bayziders> I don't want to be negative I just want to know what all the hype is about
[08:14] <shibz> because apparently a 30mb /boot isn't big enough >;.<
[08:14] <jpsamara> Did you guys enable the cube? Do you feel its necessary, its productive?
[08:14] <Evangeline> Hey people... I am using i386 version of Feisty... But I am wondering... Does the x64 version have the flash plug-in working ?
[08:14] <Flannel> shibz: have you been removing old kernels?
[08:14] <Dell-Net> zachwlewis: "1280x800" "1024x768"
[08:14] <bimberi> !slow | navreet
[08:14] <ubotu> navreet: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[08:14] <Flannel> Evangeline: no.  theres no native 64bit flash
[08:14] <shibz> no, I was going to do that after the update to feisty
[08:14] <Andy_242> hola all!
[08:14] <Jordan_U> Evangeline, Yes, but it takes a little bit of work ( not much )
[08:14] <cornucopia> bayziders, userfriendly,lively community,huge amount of apps with pratically no dependancy errors ...
[08:15] <Dell-Net> zachwlewis: front of "1024x768"
[08:15] <Flannel> shibz: How many kernels do you have installed?
[08:15] <bayziders> Same as Edgy. =)
[08:15] <Evangeline> Jordan_U does Automatix2 do the trick ?
[08:15] <zachwlewis> It appears a few times.
[08:15] <zachwlewis> Just, each time?
[08:15] <ferronica> how to make printer back to default settings
[08:15] <shibz> I have 2
[08:15] <mjbrooks> jpsamara, productive, no...  pretty, yes.... convincing windows users to convert, priceless!
[08:15] <Jordan_U> !automatix | Evangeline
[08:15] <ubotu> Evangeline: automatix is a script that tries to install some software, and often fails and breaks systems. We don't provide support for it, and we strongly discourage its use. Problems caused by Automatix are often hard to track and solve, and it might sometimes be easier to !install a fresh copy of Ubuntu. See also !WorksForMe

[08:15] <Evangeline> Thanks Jordan_U
[08:16] <shibz> well, why would it say that I need more than 30mb /boot?
[08:16] <deCon> ummm, so i have a problem with the update with a wine and automatix repositiory
[08:16] <Andy_242> urm, not wanting to seem like a painful noob, but I'm a painful noob with ubuntu- can anyone help?
[08:16] <conky> Which card for Feisty? Nvidia GeForce4 Ti 4600 128MB  or a Ati radeon 9600pr0 256MB
[08:16] <Flannel> ubuntu: did you try and do any updating before using the CD?
[08:16] <deCon> A problem occured during the update. This is usually some sort of network problem, please check your network connection and retry.
[08:16] <zachwlewis> Okay, now how do I save it?
[08:16] <zachwlewis> It's read-only?
[08:16] <Absolt> Just tried booting x64 live cd again. Get the boot menu, select any option other than boot default harddrive option. Linux kernel progress bar pops up and finishes. Get a console line something alonth the lines of "mapping kernel @10000" then my screen goes black.

[08:16] <Andy_242> ah, thanks-
[08:16] <jpsamara> mjbrooks: I don't know in edgy, but with my 855intel card the cube was slow
[08:16] <dibblego> Evangeline, yes, you need a library (forget the name)
[08:17] <Andy_242> just installed Ubuntu on a windows network
[08:17] <shibz> is there a command to cleanly remove the old kernels?
[08:17] <valermos> has anybody else gotten feisty to work with an ATI card and direct rendering?
[08:17] <exs> what happened to the launch party irc channel?
[08:17] <dibblego> shibz, apt-get remove
[08:17] <Andy_242> the installation was fine, but now I boot it up, it's connection is unstable
[08:17] <Flannel> ubuntu: that's your problem.  Some of your repositories are already switched to feisty.
[08:17] <jpsamara> Folks: Dont install automatix... really
[08:17] <deCon> anyone?
[08:17] <Jordan_U> valermos, I have
[08:17] <varka> valermos: yes me , with an 9800 pro
[08:17] <Andy_242> and now the entire network is unstable
[08:17] <bytecolor> zachwlewis, sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.original BEFORE you do any editing
[08:17] <bayziders> So laptop users how is the wireless?
[08:17] <john_> what programs are there for cd burning in linux?
[08:17] <navreet> Evangeline, yeah, but they only work 1/2 as well, like anything on the left side of the screen goes blank
[08:17] <john_> i need to burn the iso
[08:17] <Flannel> ubuntu: alt-f2 then `gksu "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"`
[08:17] <cornucopia> Evangeline, windows X64 doesnt really run *every* 32bit app you throw at it
[08:17] <Andy_242> all connections are wired, but sometimes I'll get knocked off when that machine's on
[08:17] <ubuntu> Flannel but why UBuntu when download it don't save it and when everything is download to start to install it
[08:18] <drumline_> hmm..  Automatix is an automagic software installer.  Isn't CNR going to be even better than that though?
[08:18] <mjbrooks> jpsamara, well, it takes a bit of hardware to drive it
[08:18] <SeveredCross> Whee.
[08:18] <SeveredCross> I figured out how to fix my Ubuntu install.
[08:18] <conky> dibblego thanks
[08:18] <navreet> cornucopia, Evangeline: yeah, that's true... it can't run 3dnow code, right?
[08:18] <ubuntu> Flannel that is bad,becouse if someone turn the power off the computer and then start again,he need to start from the begining.
[08:18] <mjbrooks> bayziders, wireless is excellent
[08:18] <Absolt> any ideas? :(

[08:18] <Evangeline> Cornucopia... that true... but it does a good joob working with 32Bits aplications like Firefox and plg-ins like Flash...
[08:18] <shibz> dibblego, but won't apt-get remove delete all of them? how do I specify which version to remove?
[08:18] <valermos> Jordan_U: I have a 9600 and i keep getting an error message "PreInitDAL failed"
[08:19] <navreet> Evangeline, yeah, flash is a pain man... I would still stick to 32bit ubuntu.  The hassle is not worth it

[08:19] <john_> anyone know what a good softare for burning iso's in ubuntu is?
[08:19] <valermos> Jordan_U: somehow I got 2d working... I have no idea.. but i don't have direct rendering, and it's running OpenGL: Tungsten Graphics

[08:19] <john_> thanks
[08:19] <Flannel> ubuntu: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16502/  paste that back into that file.  then save it
[08:19] <Flannel> Evangeline: xchm is one
[08:19] <Jordan_U> valermos, Have you tried the restricted driver manager?
[08:20] <Evangeline> I was using archmage... but it "text"... BTW thanks Flannel !
[08:20] <shibz> k, thx
[08:20] <vitalik> Evangeline, it is called CHM viewer
[08:20] <navreet> Evangeline, what is a CHM viewer? the windows help file format?
[08:20] <valermos> Jordan_U: Yeah, it seems like whenever i run the restricted driver mananger, it puts me back into a no video situation
[08:20] <Flannel> ubuntu: You aborted an install, and then tried to do it another way.  You can't expect ubuntu to anticipate whatever unusual thigns youre going to be doing
[08:20] <valermos> Jordan_U: I've had the most success so far with the proprietary driver from ATI
[08:20] <Tarkus> i just installed the nvidia drivers for my card via "restricted drivers manager". and when i restarted the screen was blank at the login screen. so i type my username and pasword, and i heard the logon sound, so i knew it got into ubuntu. then i did ctrl-alt-backspace, and i got the screen back again, and i still cant choose 16080x1050 in my resolution, any ideas? (this is messed up)
[08:20] <zachwlewis> bytecolor: I did that, but it is still read-only.
[08:20] <Andy_242> can anyone help with a networking problem with ubuntu please?

[08:21] <ubotu> Andy_242: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:21] <bytecolor> zachwlewis, that just made a backup copy
[08:21] <ubuntu> Flannel i try to upgrade from internet,but the server was slow,and then i download the alternated cd for 1 hours,then i try to instal
[08:21] <zachwlewis> So, how do I edit it?
[08:21] <mjbrooks> !anyone | Andy_242
[08:21] <siti> Tarkus: if you remove all the resolutions or comment them out then it should work (in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf) :(
[08:21] <Flannel> ubuntu: just replace the sources.list, save it, then it should work with the CD
[08:21] <vitalik> soory it is GnoCHM
[08:21] <john_> so is it worth the trouble to upgrade to fiesty?
[08:21] <navreet> !n00b
[08:21] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about n00b - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:22] <Andy_242> Does anybody know why a new ubuntu install may cause a network to become very unstable?
[08:22] <navreet> john_, yeah
[08:22] <siti> nvidia does much better auto detection if it does not have hints
[08:22] <ajax4> Anyone know how to get rid of the authentication warnings every time I try to install a package?
[08:22] <ubuntu> Flannel ok,one moment
[08:22] <navreet> john_, errr... I mean not until next week ;)
[08:22] <bytecolor> zachwlewis, sudo (youreditor) xorg.conf
[08:22] <SeveredCross> ajax4: sudo apt-get update, and let it finish.
[08:22] <Dell-Net> john_: no trouble to upgrade but now the servers are overloaded
[08:22] <john_> why not till next week?
[08:22] <SeveredCross> If you're using any non-standard repos, you need their pgp key.
[08:22] <john_> servers overload
[08:22] <ajax4> SeveredCross: Thanks, I'll try that.
[08:22] <mjallen> quick question on the new version of ubuntu  - has anyone gotten it running on parallels (osx 10.4)?
[08:22] <Evangeline> Andy_242.. do you have a D-Link MODEM ?
[08:22] <drumline_> Dell-Net: how long are the servers usually slammed after a release?
[08:22] <navreet> john_, I have to download over a 1.5 Gigs... need all the speed I can get.  Servers are very !slow
[08:22] <valermos_> Jordan_U, It was working fine in Edgy before I upgraded complete with Direct Rendering... I'm wondering if it's worth my time to just clean install.... it doesn't seem like i would have to do that
[08:22] <Andy_242> Evangeline- I do have a D-LINK indeed
[08:22] <zachwlewis> So, if I'm using the default editor, what would I enter?
[08:23] <cornucopia> ajax4, or install the gpg key when needed
[08:23] <navreet> !slow | john_
[08:23] <ubotu> john_: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
=== valermos_ is now known as valermos
[08:23] <Jordan_U> SeveredCross, I am getting them also, even with main, I thing it may have to do with the heavy load
[08:23] <Tarkus> siti, so i comment out all the lines in section "screen"?
[08:23] <Dell-Net> drumline_: no clue couple weeks
[08:23] <ajax4> cornucopia: How do I do that?
[08:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> OMG 10 files found corrupt in the cd image
[08:23] <zachwlewis> sudo texteditor xorg.conf?
[08:23] <dreamcastjack> hey guys

[08:23] <bytecolor> zachwlewis, dunno, gedit?
[08:23] <Ademan> ExpositionOFEvil: you should use the torrent...
[08:23] <john_> maybe it will be faster connectiong to taiwan servers for me
[08:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> I did
[08:23] <shibz> I already have 6.10
[08:23] <bytecolor> I only use vim
[08:23] <SeveredCross> Jordan_U: You probably haven't gotten the gpg keys then. I had that happen, but I just ran apt-get update until it picked up.
[08:23] <john_> ....
[08:23] <dreamcastjack> i cant use any package managers
[08:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> both cds didnt work
[08:23] <siti> Tarkus: all the subsections
[08:23] <Evangeline> Andy_242 just a minute I have a Tip somewhere...
[08:23] <SeveredCross> shibz: It says that, but it's really going to 7.04
[08:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> images boot up correctly
[08:23] <dreamcastjack> i apparently need to reinstall frostwire but I cant
[08:23] <Jordan_U> valermos, How did you install the ATi drivers in Edgy?
[08:23] <zachwlewis> Will that make it read/write, or still read-only?
[08:23] <cornucopia> ajax4, for example; wget -q http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/medibuntu-key.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
[08:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> then when checking they all fail
[08:23] <deCon> how can i remove automatix so that i can upgrade?
[08:23] <Andy_242> Evangeline- much appreciated!
[08:23] <drumline_> Dell-Net: couple weeks sounds a bit long..   thanks though...    How long have you been using ubuntu?   Is it your primary box?
[08:24] <Ademan> ExpositionOFEvil: maybe your burn was bad? because the torrent should check for data integrity
[08:24] <mjbrooks> !enter | dreamcastjack
[08:24] <ubotu> dreamcastjack: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[08:24] <SeveredCross> deCon: sudo apt-get remove automatix
[08:24] <SeveredCross> ?
[08:24] <valermos> Jordan_U, hmm... It was a while ago... But I think I used the xorg-driver-fglrx package from the repository... I'm pretty sure i added the restricted repository to my sources
[08:24] <Dell-Net> drumline_: hmm yes it is using it for 1 year something
[08:24] <deCon> SeveredCross, that won't remove the packages it installed though, correct?
[08:24] <tarelerulz> I am lost I have movie and it is in .vob ,but I can't seem to play it and don't mplayer play .vob files
[08:24] <mjallen> anyone running fiesty under parallels?
[08:24] <drumline_> Dell-Net: anything it doesn't do that you want it to?
[08:25] <SeveredCross> deCon: nope.
[08:25] <mjbrooks> !anyone > mjallen
[08:25] <Jordan_U> valermos, Could you pastebin your sources.list?
[08:25] <EvilDennisR> Did fiesty get released ?
[08:25] <john_> anyone here uses osx?  Im debating whether to get a faster machine cheaper and put ubuntu on it or spend the money to get a bit slower laptop with osx...?
[08:25] <Dell-Net> drumline_: suspend and hibernate dosent work on my laptop
[08:25] <EvilDennisR> ...Yup, it did..
[08:25] <tristanmike> EvilDennisR: you betcha
[08:25] <zachwlewis> Wow... I think I got it.
[08:25] <valermos> Jordan_U, sure, just a sec
[08:25] <mjbrooks> !feisty > EvilDennisR
[08:25] <EvilDennisR> I said it did!
[08:25] <Dell-Net> drumline_: but havent realy looked in to it
[08:25] <drumline_> Dell-Net: Why is it so difficult to get suspend working on those things?
[08:26] <mjallen> john_ : i am trying to get fiesty running in OSX under parallels but having trouble installing it
[08:26] <Dell-Net> feisty booup time is so quick :D
[08:26] <john_> can u bootcamp it
[08:26] <bytecolor> this channel has a bit of velocity eh ;)
[08:26] <mjallen> i haven't tried that yet
[08:26] <Jordan_U> john_, I use OSx but basically just for Final Cut Studio, if you don't do Video Editing / Graphics I would say go pure Ubuntu
[08:26] <zachwlewis> Okay, I added "1280x1024," but it didn't appear in my Screen Resolution list.
[08:26] <Dell-Net> drumline_: it works witchout nvidia drivers and so on but when i install nvidia and beryl .. then..
[08:26] <mjallen> i would really like to get it working with parallels
[08:26] <Ademan> Jordan_U: have you ever tried cinelerra? is it as bad as people say?
[08:26] <Dell-Net> ok now coffy break for me see you
[08:27] <mjallen> XP works flawlessly, but i can't get past the bootstrapping on ubuntu
[08:27] <john_> i installed vista in virtualbox on ubuntu
[08:27] <Evangeline> Andy... try this https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ifupdown/+question/3631
[08:27] <drumline_> mjallen: what's wrong with the boostrapping?
[08:27] <ExpositionOFEvil> why does the image always have errors!
[08:27] <valermos> Jordan_U, http://pastebin.ca/449447
[08:27] <calliope_> ok so ive already started the update manager and the button for 7.04 has been selected
[08:27] <zachwlewis> Does anyone know how to add a resolution to the "Screen Resolution" list?
[08:27] <Jordan_U> Ademan, Only briefly, it looks very powerful, but has a high learning curve

[08:28] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Was the md5sum of the image correct?
[08:28] <EvilDennisR> Point me in the direction of a /etc/apt/sources.list for fiesty
[08:28] <mjallen> the launch fails with this error: unable to locate RSDP
[08:28] <Tarkus> siti, do i have to restart? or would logout/login work?
[08:28] <zachwlewis> Flannel: Last time I did that, it crashed.
[08:28] <ExpositionOFEvil> yep
[08:28] <Andy_242> cheers- much in your debt, Eva!
[08:28] <mjallen> it gets past that message then is just a blank screen
[08:28] <ExpositionOFEvil> the md5sum was correct
[08:28] <zachwlewis> Like, I got stuck on that black restart screen.
[08:28] <bytecolor> ctrl+alt+backspace
[08:28] <Ademan> ExpositionOFEvil: then it's your burner, try burning at a lower speed
[08:28] <ExpositionOFEvil> k thanks
[08:28] <Flannel> ExpositionOFEvil: burn at 4x
[08:28] <ExpositionOFEvil> I was thinking the same thing
[08:28] <ExpositionOFEvil> my cd says 4x
[08:28] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: What about the md5sum of the cd after burning. Did you try that?
[08:28] <Whisperkiller> ok im back now
[08:28] <ExpositionOFEvil> how to?
[08:28] <Flannel> ExpositionOFEvil: make sure your burner says 4x

[08:29] <ExpositionOFEvil> =) thank you
[08:29] <Jordan_U> valermos, That all looks fine, did you ever install the Drivers from ATi.com/
[08:29] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Lemme make sure
[08:29] <Jordan_U> ?
[08:29] <mjallen> what is the equivalent of ctrl-alt-backspace on the mac keyboard?
=== michel_p is now known as michelp
[08:29] <matason> Hirvinen, I mainly use Apache, PHP5, MySQL, Vim etc and I'm on Dapper LTS, are these packages available for Feisty? Or should I move to Edgy or just stick with Dapper?
[08:29] <Jordan_U> mjallen, ctrl+alt+delete
[08:29] <matason> Ooops
[08:29] <matason> Sorry about the auto complete
[08:30] <Ademan> ExpositionOFEvil: i always burn at 2x just to be safe because even though my burner says like 16x or something, i always get errors at that speed
[08:30] <Jordan_U> mjallen, There is no real delete key on macs :)
[08:30] <Flannel> matason: they are available on edgy, and feisty.  But theyre fine on dapper just the same.
[08:30] <zachwlewis> Okay! More questions!
[08:30] <mjallen> jordan - thanks... nothing happened when i tried that so i was wondering if it were different
[08:30] <zachwlewis> Can I change my username?
[08:30] <matason> Flannel: So is there much point in upgrading?
[08:30] <valermos> Jordan_U, Yeah, as an alternative I followed a guide to install the ati-driver-installer-8.36.5-x86.x86_64.run package from ATI
[08:31] <john_> how big is the iso for you guys? ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
[08:31] <drumline_> Kubuntu ISO @ 100k/s from a certain server that I wont mention right now.  :)   ...not bad.
[08:31] <valermos> Jordan_U, this is the guide i followed, method 2: http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide
[08:31] <john_> ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso 200MB
[08:31] <john_> is that right?
[08:31] <Jordan_U> valermos, What you did then may be interfering with the drivers from the repos.
[08:31] <Samuli^> 200MB? Can't be that small.
[08:31] <ubuntu> Flannel it won;'t work again
[08:31] <Ademan> john_: i believe its 680 something
[08:31] <versix> has anyone else got proxy_balancer to work on apache under feisty/
[08:31] <drumline_> the image is around 690MB
[08:31] <Flannel> john_: should be 696 or so
[08:31] <Ademan> john_: it just barely fits on a cd
[08:31] <john_> must have messed up
[08:32] <Jordan_U> valermos, Follow the uninstall instructions then try the repo drivers again
[08:32] <john_> dam redownload :(
[08:32] <Darii> Jordan_U: of course there is an delete key on macs
[08:32] <Jordan_U> Darii, Where?
[08:32] <T0uCH> hi all i am just finishing installing the upgrades.... but when i go to the update manager i click on upgrades.. i got a error meesage who says that i can only run partial installation du to a incomplete installation.. what i need to do?
[08:32] <mjbrooks> john_, use a torrent
[08:32] <EvilDennisR> deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ fiesty ...  ?
[08:32] <john_> what about ubuntu studio
[08:33] <Jordan_U> Darii, You may want to know that I am using a mac right now :)
[08:33] <john_> their site is still the same
[08:33] <Darii> Jordan_U: where it is on every keyboard
[08:33] <DumberDrummer> anyway to get flash working on 64bit feisty fawn?
[08:33] <john_> they going to releaase?
[08:33] <zachwlewis> Is there any way to apply some "smooth text" to the screen?
[08:33] <Ademan> john_: you should probably torrent anyways, it's easier on the servers, data checks it for you, etc
[08:33] <valermos> Jordan_U, Alright I'll work on it... I'm about go go buy an nvidia card :) Thanks for your help. I might be back.
[08:33] <Ademan> !torrents
[08:33] <zachwlewis> Like, in XP there's Clear Type.
[08:33] <ubotu> Torrent downloads for the Ubuntu ISOs are available on all the download pages. For Feisty: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[08:33] <Jordan_U> zachwlewis, You mean anti-ailiasing ?
[08:33] <zachwlewis> Sure!
[08:33] <Darii> Jordan_U: an on portables u use fn+backspace
[08:33] <Ademan> zachwlewis: uh truetype does anti-aliasing
[08:34] <mjbrooks> DumberDrummer, I believe flash and 64bit are not playing well currently
[08:34] <zachwlewis> My fonts and stuff still look... pixely.
[08:34] <T0uCH> i got a serious problem with the install and now i am runnin out of diskspace.... please someone
[08:34] <ubuntu> Flannel it didn't work
[08:34] <Jordan_U> Darii, That isn't a key, that's a key combination :)

[08:35] <Darii> Jordan_U, yes but that only concerns portables, the normal mac keyboard has an delete key ;)
[08:36] <mjallen> ok - so what does the "unable to locate RSDP" message mean?
[08:36] <ExpositionOFEvil> yeah
[08:36] <YNWA> anyone?

[08:37] <ubuntu> EvilDennisR????
[08:37] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: You may need to use a different dev name then. Possiblly /dev/cdrom0 or /dev/cdrom1. Do either of those work?
[08:38] <jb> does "Desktop Effects" typically cause a slowdown with scrolling etc?
[08:38] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: Why not?

[08:38] <T0uCH> is there someone who can help me in privite with this install bug ?

[08:38] <EvilDennisR> ubuntu: You spelt it wrong a 2nd time..
[08:38] <YNWA> anyone use a fingerprint reader here?
[08:39] <ubuntu> EvilDennisR where>
[08:39] <Crypt> anyone know where the Kubuntu Feist PowerPC ISO is?
[08:39] <noiesmo> gr3ml1n, you need to add info on your monitor
[08:39] <yharrow_mobile> ubuntu: have you actually registered the ubuntu nick?
[08:39] <jb> I have a P4 - 2.4ghz with an nvidia 7600 GS.
[08:39] <yharrow_mobile> :D
[08:39] <ajax4> Crypt: I don't remember seeing it on the list...may not be available yet.
[08:39] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: Ok... Soooo, why can't I edit sources.list directly ?
[08:39] <jb> should that be smooth for desktop effects
[08:39] <gr3ml1n> i got a Gateway EV700
[08:39] <YNWA> >_<
[08:39] <ubuntu> yharrow_mobile: no
[08:39] <Flannel> ubuntu: Oh.  You know why you might still need the internet to upgrade?  Because you've installed stuff from universe, which won't be on the CD
[08:40] <derek_> Hi
[08:40] <Crypt> ajax4: odd. :-(
[08:40] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, Because that will not do extra sanity checks when you upgrade and is not recommended
[08:40] <yharrow_mobile> ubuntu: oh shucks, mark probably beat you to it :P
[08:40] <ajax4> jb: Don't know, but probably alot smoother than my Pentium-3 :)
[08:40] <gr3ml1n> noiesmo: can you help me? i entered 85-85 to lock it to 85 hz but now i can only select between 800x600 and 640x480
[08:40] <gr3ml1n> @85hz
[08:40] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, What is wrong with update manager?
[08:40] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: I've just edited /etc/apt/sources.list and changed the distro when I've upgraded under Debian
[08:40] <jb> ajax4 lol probably.  I guess I'm a littler better off hehe
[08:40] <yharrow_mobile> does anyone here know how to do an aspell dump of an entire dictionary?
[08:40] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, Ubuntu is not Debian
[08:40] <ajax4> Crypt: I think the Kubuntu team is a little behind the main Ubunutu team.
[08:40] <ubuntu> Flannel: and is there some method to remove then
[08:40] <ajax4> !kubuntu
[08:40] <ubotu> Kubuntu is Ubuntu with KDE, the K Desktop Environment, instead of Gnome. See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support: #kubuntu - See also !KDE
[08:41] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: This is true =)
[08:41] <derek_> Why did I get forwarded to #ubuntu ?
[08:41] <noiesmo> gr3ml1n, here is my xorg.conf note my entries on lines 74 & 75
[08:41] <ajax4> Crypt: Try asking in the #kubuntu channel.
[08:41] <ExpositionOFEvil> holy my cd drive going overdrive
[08:41] <Tarkus> how do i tell if my graphics drivers are installed correctly?
[08:41] <derek_> why can't I join #ubuntu+1?
[08:41] <DumberDrummer> mjbrooks: owell, thanks
[08:41] <Crypt> ajax4: thanks for the response.
[08:41] <Crypt> :-)
[08:41] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: Which is why I asked you why I can't edit sources.list directly.. and you answered my question.. I'll have to upgrade tomorrow when I'm at work
[08:41] <ajax4> Crypt: np :)
[08:41] <noiesmo> gr3ml1n, but you must be carefull you can damage monitor
[08:41] <gr3ml1n> where?
[08:41] <Flannel> ubuntu: well, sure... you'd have to remove all the packages you've installed from universe though.

[08:41] <mjbrooks> DumberDrummer, for?
[08:41] <yharrow_mobile> derek_: feisty is now released. All feisty related issues will be addressed here.
[08:41] <derek_> yharrow_mobile, ok, thanks
[08:41] <ubuntu> Flannel and how to see what package are installed
[08:42] <YNWA> I'm trying to install a UPEK fingerprint driver, can anyone help
[08:42] <YNWA> ?
[08:42] <yharrow_mobile> derek_: your welcome
[08:42] <desmond> how can i activate beryl effects on feisty fawn?
[08:42] <derek_> I'm getting errors on updating apt-get
[08:42] <gr3ml1n> noiesmo:  restarting x now
[08:42] <kski> why is beryl 2.1 listed in the package manager when 2.0 is the newest version on beryl's web site?
[08:42] <Flannel> ubuntu: synaptic might be the easiest method.  Why are you so worrid about not downloading from the internet?
[08:42] <yharrow_mobile> wow, 1027 members. is that a record high?
[08:42] <Flannel> yharrow_mobile: We topped 1500 overnight
[08:42] <Jordan_U> desmond, Do you want beryl specifically or just wobbly windows, desktop cube etc?
[08:42] <mjbrooks> !beryl | desmond
[08:42] <ubotu> desmond: Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[08:42] <ubuntu> Flannel becouse i download it CD fast
[08:43] <gr3ml1n> noiesmo: thx it worked
[08:43] <noiesmo> gr3ml1n, np :)
[08:43] <ubuntu> Flannel and when i have the cd,i can install it from cd
[08:43] <Flannel> ubuntu: The stuff you'll be downloading *will not* be on the CD
[08:43] <Jordan_U> desmond, System -> Preferences -> Desktop Effects
[08:43] <dreamcastjack> how do I get rid of a broken .deb file?
[08:43] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: I installed edgy on my desktop at work (because I couldn't stand XP), I don't have anything crazy installed, just the regular old desktop.. Are there really crazy checks that the site manager does vs just editing the source and apt-get update/upgrade/dist-upgrade ?
[08:43] <Flannel> ubuntu: You installed additional stuff, from universe, that isn't on the CD.  So you need to get it from the repositories
[08:43] <noiesmo> dreamcastjack, use aptitude remove packagename
[08:43] <ubuntu> Flannel ja but after that when i upgrade to ubuntu 7 i will upgrade then
[08:43] <YNWA> can anyone assist with the installation of a fingerprint driver?
[08:43] <Whiz2> anyone here know the package names for pop3 and imap for retrieving email?
[08:43] <noiesmo> dreamcastjack, aptitude has better dependency resolution than apt-get
[08:44] <yharrow_mobile> Flannel: wow!, you guys should keep record of the highest number of members and try to beat it ;)
[08:44] <ubuntu> Flannel and how can i see who stuff are installed
[08:44] <ExpositionOFEvil> finally

[08:44] <yharrow_mobile> does anyone here know how to do an aspell dump of an entire dictionary?
[08:44] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: It's a good burn, then. Must be some other problem.
[08:44] <shepherd> 
[08:44] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, I don't know what it does exactly, a dist-upgrade will probably work, but why risk it?
[08:44] <derek_> Why are some entries starting with Ign ?
[08:44] <yharrow_mobile> !aspell dump
[08:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about aspell dump - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:44] <derek_> shedi, which language? Japanese?
[08:44] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: ...because the site manager just runs apt-get and dpkg ?
[08:44] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: ;)
[08:44] <derek_> shepherd, which language, Japanese?
[08:44] <shepherd> chinese
[08:44] <yharrow_mobile> !dictionary dump
[08:44] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dictionary dump - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <Whisperkiller> i would really appreciate it if someone could help me install grub

[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dictionaries - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <ExpositionOFEvil> could be my cd drive?

[08:45] <yharrow_mobile> !aspell
[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about aspell - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <derek_> shepherd, ok. And where are you from?
[08:45] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, According to the Ubuntu devs it does more than that
[08:45] <ubuntu_> I keep trying to make a partition in gparted
[08:45] <yharrow_mobile> !aspell dump
[08:45] <shepherd> beijing
[08:45] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about aspell dump - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:45] <Flannel> ubuntu: start up synaptic, and take a look.  If you want to see what you have that's in universe, open up your sources list again (with gksu) and add a # infront of the universe line, then save, go to synaptic, and hit "refresh", you'll get a whole bunch of "obsolete/local" packages, those are the things in universe
[08:45] <umop>  /kick yharrow_mobile
[08:45] <eternalswd> about how long should I wait before upgrading so as to avoid the server rapage?
[08:45] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: that and I logged out of my desktop so I can't vnc in and use the package manager =(
[08:45] <yharrow_mobile> umop what the hel
[08:45] <calliope_> well so far so good
[08:45] <shepherd> i'm a post-graduate student
[08:45] <Flannel> !fishing | yharrow_mobile
[08:45] <ubotu> yharrow_mobile: Please investigate with me only in /msg or in #ubuntu-bots (see also !Bot). Abusing the channel bots will only result in angry ops...
[08:45] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: If it read the md5sum correctly it shouldn't have trouble just loading the files to install.
[08:45] <ubuntu_> gparted says that my partition sda3 is already mounted
[08:45] <ubuntu_> what do I do?
[08:45] <YNWA> can anyone help with installing a fingerprint driver?
[08:45] <desmond> sorry, my desktop crashed
[08:45] <YNWA> PLEASE?
[08:45] <Flannel> !repeat | YNWA
[08:45] <yharrow_mobile> Flannel: thank you

[08:46] <Whisperkiller> anyone able to help me install grub?
[08:46] <shepherd> anyone speak chinese?
[08:46] <ExpositionOFEvil> I did a check cdrom validity
[08:46] <yharrow_mobile> Flannel: I appreciate it
[08:46] <Samuli^> any virtualbox users here?
[08:46] <ExpositionOFEvil> and it turned out 10 corrupted files
[08:46] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, There is a cli version for servers, just install update-manager-core
[08:46] <desmond> jordan_U: I got the beryl effects, unfortunately I have lost the maximize, minimize and close buttons
[08:46] <ubuntu_> some crema-sum-fun-yung-gai?
[08:46] <yharrow_mobile> umop: did you really mean to kick me, or was that just a warning?
[08:46] <jrsims> Got a torrent download going - I'm peeing my pants in anticipation for feisty!
[08:46] <Flannel> ubuntu: Really, you ought to just sit through the doownload.  You'll have to download the stuff eventually
[08:46] <YNWA> shepherd: yeah
[08:46] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Odd, since the md5sum says its fine. You could try installing with a different cdrom.
[08:46] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: I just installed the desktop iso on my machine, not the server
[08:47] <ubuntu_> anyone know anything about gparted
[08:47] <ubuntu_> it says my discs are allready mounted
[08:47] <ubuntu_> *_*
[08:47] <jrsims> Shoot - I have a crappy torrent with like no users. Anyone have an active torrent they can link me to?
[08:47] <ExpositionOFEvil> if that one says 10 corrupted im guessing its in the original
[08:47] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, Do I understand you correctly that you need to do the upgrade from ssh with no X though?
[08:47] <ubuntu> Flannel no,when i update UBuntu 7 i will wait to see how it works and then i will upgrade.
[08:47] <Whisperkiller> i could use some help installing grub...i have been trying for an hour
[08:47] <mjbrooks> Madpilot, any idea who services ubotu?
[08:47] <julian> anyone know why modprobing kvm freezes system
[08:47] <ubuntu_> error /dev/sda3 contains a mounted filesystem
[08:47] <Madpilot> mjbrooks, Seveas
[08:47] <Samuli^> I have a problem with virtualbox and feisty. Full-screen isn't working properly.
[08:48] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Lemme check mine and see if it says the same thing.
[08:48] <ExpositionOFEvil> k
[08:48] <desmond> okay, now I have Beryl effects activated on my Feisty Fawn, how can I activate Emerald theme Manager?
[08:48] <Flannel> ubuntu: well, alright.  You'll have to remove all your universe packages, then upgrade. I've explained all the steps.  Have fun and good luck.
[08:48] <mjbrooks> Madpilot, don't think I've seen him here  is he on the dev channel???
[08:48] <ubuntu__> i'm trying the latest ubuntu and it wasn't able to detect my monitor
[08:48] <camer0ff> where do i find my HTACCESS file?
[08:48] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: You said I should use the package manager to do the upgrade.. Currently, there is no X session running, so I can't just vnc to that machine
[08:48] <ubuntu> Flannel ok THanks.
[08:48] <Samuli^> desmond, if you checked the "enable desktop effects" you are not using beryl, but compiz.
[08:48] <siti> desmond: beryl-manager?
[08:48] <happy_broccoli> http://www.digg.com/general_sciences/Robert_Bussard_Electrostatic_Fusion_contract_renewed_by_the_Navy
[08:49] <Madpilot> mjbrooks, not sure he's on IRC at all right now

[08:49] <nu-> Hey guys. something weird happens during installation, that didn't happen in the beta version
[08:49] <camer0ff> just need some help with apache
[08:49] <Madpilot> mjbrooks, it's also still before 9am in his timezone.
[08:49] <camer0ff> can anyone help?|
[08:49] <desmond> Samuli^: thanks, then I'll be using compiz and  compiz doesn't have a emerald theme manager isn't it?
[08:49] <mjbrooks> Madpilot, do you talk to him on occasion?
[08:49] <nu-> it freezes. it says "kernel alive mapping tables"
[08:49] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: So you say the corrupt file warning and didn't try installing it, is that what happened?
[08:49] <nu-> then my monitor goes to sleep
[08:50] <ExpositionOFEvil> yep
[08:50] <Madpilot> mjbrooks, yes, he's on lots of channels - including here - when he's active
[08:50] <Jordan_U> EvilDennisR, Then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install update-manager-core && sudo do-release-upgrade
[08:50] <dreamcastjack> okay frostwire wasnt installed all the way, but it wont let me try to reinstall it. what do i do?
[08:50] <Samuli^> desmond, right. ubuntuforums has a nice walkthrough for installing beryl and emerald.
[08:50] <ExpositionOFEvil> I dont want to have a filed installation
[08:50] <siti> nu-: hmm, have you tried the safe mode?
[08:50] <ExpositionOFEvil> like before
[08:50] <ExpositionOFEvil> failed
[08:50] <ExpositionOFEvil> *
[08:50] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: While I'm doing this, try the check again on another cdrom if you can.
[08:50] <nu-> siti: you mean graphics safe mode?
[08:50] <Flannel> Jordan_U: except update-manager-core doesn't exist.
[08:50] <LiNERROR> Samuli^: link?
[08:50] <desmond> Samuli^: thanks, I'll check it there
[08:50] <ubuntu> Flannel can you rewrite what i need to do
[08:50] <siti> nu-: yep
[08:50] <mjbrooks> Madpilot, would you mind letting him know the websearch crashes when you do a search of two letter keywords?
[08:50] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Another cdrom drive I mean.
[08:50] <tristanmike> I've installed libdvdcss2 and gxine according to the Support documentation, but I get this error... "No demuxer found - stream format not recognised."  can anyone help please ?
[08:50] <nu-> siti: no. i don't think it's that though =(
[08:51] <ubuntu> Flannel beocuse i exit before and it was deleted.
[08:51] <brianski> is there a feisty torrent out?
[08:51] <Flannel> mjbrooks: file a bug against ubuntu-bots in launchpad
[08:51] <brianski> i go to /download on ubuntu.org and get links for edgy
[08:51] <noiesmo> dreamcastjack, have you tried sudo apt-get install -f
[08:51] <mjbrooks> Ah    thanks Flannel
[08:51] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: update-manager-core doesn't exist
[08:51] <Jordan_U> Flannel, I thought it was going to be added to Edgy-updates when Feisty was released
[08:51] <Madpilot> brianski, http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/
[08:51] <mjbrooks> didn't realize it was in Launchpad  ;)
[08:51] <Flannel> ubuntu: If you want to see what you have that's in universe, open up your sources list again (with gksu) and add a # infront of the universe line, then save, go to synaptic, and hit "refresh", you'll get a whole bunch of "obsolete/local" packages, those are the things in universe
[08:51] <Cheetah2> I'm planning on setting up a server that runs a few virtual servers using vmware-server. Which Ubuntu release do you suggest? Or do you suggest to use Debian instead?
[08:51] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: Ah wait, I lied..
[08:51] <shepherd> does anyone know about how to become a partner?
[08:51] <Flannel> Jordan_U: apparently not, since no one seems to have it
[08:51] <ExpositionOFEvil> k
[08:52] <Samuli^> LiNERROR, nope, sorry. Should be easily found with search though.
[08:52] <shepherd> is there any partner here?
[08:52] <Jordan_U> !info update-manager-core edgy
[08:52] <ubotu> Package update-manager-core does not exist in edgy

[08:52] <jpsamara> In software sources, Feisty Updates is not checked, theres a - sign.. should I check it?
[08:52] <brianski> Madpilot, thanks
[08:52] <ubuntu_> *_*
[08:52] <shepherd> any partner here?
[08:53] <ubuntu_> soes any1 here know anything about gparted
[08:53] <ajax4> ubuntu: What do you need to know?
[08:53] <wj32> hello
[08:53] <EvilDennisR> Jordan_U: instead, I just edited /etc/gdm/gdm.conf and allowed myself to automagically login... then restarted gdm. Boom, instant X session ;)
[08:53] <siti> ubuntu_: ask the question
[08:53] <Jordan_U> !info update-manager-core edgy-updates
[08:53] <ubotu> update-manager-core: manage release upgrades. In component main, is standard. Version 1:0.59.18 (feisty), package size 25 kB, installed size 1812 kB
[08:53] <ajax4> ubuntu_: What do you need to know?
[08:53] <ubuntu_> i cannot get it to work
[08:53] <Madpilot> shepherd, partner of/for what?
[08:53] <wj32> i'm upgrading to feisty using the alternate cd and it says i need to download over 1300MB!!!!!!!! ahhh!!!
[08:53] <ajax4> ubuntu_: What are you trying to do?
[08:53] <yikes__> does anyone know how to change language input?
[08:53] <Flannel> Jordan_U: thats feisty version
[08:53] <ubuntu> wj32 the same problem man.
[08:53] <ubuntu_> I am trying to format some empty space but it says it contains a mounted file system
[08:54] <ubuntu_> I delete that partition
[08:54] <ubuntu_> and start over
[08:54] <Flannel> Jordan_U: and Im looking at the package list right now (http://br.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-updates/Release) and it's not there
[08:54] <ubuntu_> and it still says it
[08:54] <Flannel> !enter | ubuntu_
[08:54] <ubotu> ubuntu_: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[08:54] <Madpilot> shepherd, please do not PM people without asking permission first. Thank you.
[08:54] <wj32> ubuntu: but last time i tried to upgrade to edgy the same way. it also wanted to download over 1300MB. it actually downloaded like 600MB
[08:54] <Jordan_U> Flannel, why does ubotu say that it's in edgy-updates? Where does ubotu get it's info from?
[08:54] <ubuntu> wj32,ja bugs man
[08:54] <shepherd> ok
[08:54] <shepherd> sorry
[08:54] <wj32> ubuntu: you see, the cd already contains 600MB of packages
[08:55] <ubuntu> wj32 i see it
[08:55] <Madpilot> shepherd, and I'm still not sure what you mean by 'partner'...
[08:55] <eternalswd> Cheetah2, you probably want Dapper since it's the LTS release, but if there are bugs in Dapper that are fixed later that you cannot work around, then try either edgy or feisty
[08:55] <ajax4> ubuntu_: You have to apply the changes before they take effect.
[08:55] <Flannel> Jordan_U: no idea
[08:55] <ubuntu> wj32,tell i on Flannel
[08:55] <ubuntu_> yes I know I did
[08:55] <bayziders> Yeah I upgraded to fiesty and I cannot play any of my music, in amarok or rythmbox.
[08:55] <wj32> ubuntu: what?
[08:55] <ubuntu_> I hit apply
[08:55] <ubuntu> wj32 tell this problem on FLannel
[08:55] <ExpositionOFEvil> ajax4
[08:55] <shepherd> did u know Ubuntu has some program?
[08:55] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Yes?
[08:56] <ubuntu> wj32 this problem is big.
[08:56] <ExpositionOFEvil> I need to set my bios to boot from my external first
[08:56] <MSTK> Hi, I'm sort of still learning the command line.  I've read over the documentation, but I can't seem to find an answer.  How do you assign an application to a terminal command?  It seems to have to do with "ln -s [some path]  [some path]  command-to-be-assigned", but I can't figure out the syntax.
[08:56] <wj32> ubuntu: sorry, but whats FLannel?
[08:56] <Flannel> wj32: alternate CD only has stuff in main/restricted.  Anything youve installed in universe/muliverse will have to be downloaded, as it's not on any CD
[08:56] <Cheetah2> eternalswd, thanks. Does Ubuntu Server have any drawbacks compared to Debian? We have a load of Debian servers and are wondering if switching to Ubuntu Server makes sense.
[08:56] <ExpositionOFEvil> did u check urs?
[08:56] <wj32> Flannel: oh. you're flannel
[08:56] <shepherd> programs like tech support and training
[08:56] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: Yes, no errors found on mine.
[08:56] <siti> Cheetah2: no selinux by default?
[08:56] <ExpositionOFEvil> hmm
[08:56] <ExpositionOFEvil> and same md5sum?!
[08:56] <ExpositionOFEvil> thats wierd
[08:56] <ExpositionOFEvil> really
[08:57] <Cheetah2> siti, alright ;)
[08:57] <nu-> any major differences between the 32 and 64 bit?
[08:57] <ajax4> ExpositionOFEvil: I guess its some kind of obscure read error. See if you get it again with a different cdrom drive.
[08:57] <ubuntu_> the following error occurred while applying the operations mkdosfs: /dev/sda3 contains a mounted filesystem
[08:57] <wj32> Flannel: mmm. but last time it said >1300MB when it was skipping over heaps of packages that were on the cd already
[08:57] <MSTK> pretty much, can anyone help me figure out the syntax for the "ln" terminal command?
[08:57] <ubuntu_> even though it was empty space when i first booted up
[08:57] <Flannel> wj32: right.
[08:57] <MSTK> I can't seem to find it in the documentation.
[08:57] <Crypt> man i was looking forward to kubuntu ppc feisty :-(
[08:57] <crdlb> nu-, yeah, there's no 64bit flash player :)
[08:57] <shepherd> madpilot: i think it is profitable
[08:57] <ubuntu_> any ideas?
[08:57] <Flannel> MSTK: `man ln`
[08:57] <ajax4> MSTK: Have you tried "man ln" ?
[08:57] <MSTK> ah
[08:57] <derek_> exit
[08:57] <MSTK> heh, sorry guys.  i'm kind of new to this whole thing.
[08:57] <Madpilot> shepherd, you think what is profitable? Sorry, but I still have no idea what the heck you're talking about...
[08:58] <wj32> Flannel: i'm upgrading right now. its going Fetching file 1-----------*goes by very fast*------200
[08:58] <ajax4> ubuntu_: What is the first step you are trying to do? Delete the partition?
[08:58] <YNWA> Can someone please help with installing a program?
[08:58] <ubuntu_> well I deleted applied and rebooted
[08:58] <ubuntu_> it was empty
[08:58] <camer0ff> Where do i find .htaccess?
[08:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> whats key to access bio ?
[08:58] <Flannel> camer0ff: If you haven't already made one, then nowhere.
[08:58] <ubuntu_> but when I try to create and format to ext3 it says the /dev/sda3 contains a mounted filesystem
[08:59] <camer0ff> Flannel, i thought apache makes it when you install it?
[08:59] <ubuntu_> *_*
[08:59] <ubuntu_> im stumped
[08:59] <ajax4> ubuntu: Did you try unmounting it first?
[08:59] <shepherd> madpilot: i just wanna provide some commercial support for chinese people, company
[08:59] <ubuntu_> um
[08:59] <ubuntu_> yeah
[08:59] <ubuntu_> I unmounted deleted
[08:59] <ubuntu_> and rebooted
[08:59] <ubuntu_> :D
[08:59] <Flannel> camer0ff: no.  you put .htaccess files in apache directories, to regulate what happens in that directory

[08:59] <ajax4> ubuntu_: Are you using the gparted in the ubuntu installer?
[08:59] <ubuntu_> came up as blank space when I rebooted
[08:59] <dug> isd
[08:59] <ubuntu_> yes
[09:00] <shepherd> madpilot: do u have any idea about it?
=== dug is now known as mrdlouisd
[09:00] <ExpositionOFEvil> whats key to access bio??
[09:00] <Shaddox> Hi everyone. ^^
[09:00] <ubuntu> wj32 and what that mean
[09:00] <Madpilot> shepherd, go ahead - if you want to contact canonical about it, check their website or the Ubuntu support site.
[09:00] <ubuntu_> I have also tried sudo gparted
[09:00] <camer0ff> Flannel, ah fair enough. maybe i am looking for something else then. i need to have index.php load instead of index.html
[09:00] <Shaddox> How do I find and kill a process by name in a console?
[09:00] <Flannel> camer0ff: remove index.html then?
[09:00] <camer0ff> Flannel, i have set it before.. but i do not know where
[09:00] <nu-> crdlb: thanks =D

[09:01] <camer0ff> Flannel, there is a file that has a whole heap of extensions, and the order of priority.
[09:01] <ajax4> ubuntu_: I'm not sure the problem...you could also try to use the Gparted Live CD.
[09:01] <Flannel> camer0ff: you can change the order in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf about halfway down.  I think you cna also set them in .htaccess files

[09:03] <Cactii> thanks

[09:04] <mneptok> Madpilot: the mirrors are swamped
[09:04] <camer0ff> Flannel,  i mean the information in the file...
[09:05] <EvilDennisR> Damn.. about 5 hours to download feisty packages..
[09:05] <EvilDennisR> Thats why I like using sid with Debian =)
[09:05] <Madpilot> mneptok, yeah, but pulling one .torrent file off isn't the same as dragging the entire ISO off..
[09:05] <Flannel> camer0ff: right after the errordocument stuff, is "DirectoryIndex"
[09:05] <Cactii> Thanks mneptok.
[09:05] <mneptok> Madpilot: you still have a 3+ minute wait for a directory listing

[09:06] <Madpilot> mneptok, really? Went to grab the alt CD torrent a while ago, that URL I gave came up fine. Not fast, but didn't take 3min.
[09:06] <YogSothoth> Hi!
[09:06] <Geoffrey2> well, Feisty is up and running over here....now I just need to figure out why I can get audio but no video from VLC
[09:06] <andy_> are there widgets for the gnome desktop? or can I just use konfubalator or whatever that name was?
[09:07] <Cactii> I want to upgrade using the LiveCD rather than over the internet... is that a problem???
[09:07] <mneptok> Madpilot: OSUOSL and PDX.edu are drowning. probably better to point people at montreal for .torrent files
[09:07] <YogSothoth> I just downloaded xubuntu 7.04. I already run ubuntu but want a fresh clean install. Can I run the installed directly from my current ubuntu, from the mounted ISO, without burning it?
[09:07] <mneptok> Cactii: you need the alt CD
[09:07] <siti> Geoffrey2: audio works fine for me in vlc, I wonder what the issue is...
[09:07] <jussi01> andy_, you can grab gdesklets - it may have something your after
[09:07] <Madpilot> mneptok, fair enough. at least torrents just get faster when they're busier, not slower...
[09:07] <andy_> jussi01, ok, gonna check it out :)
[09:07] <mneptok> andy_: gdesklets

[09:30] <chr_>   1)  create it at the same disk sector (use sector as the unit!)
[09:30] <chr_>   2)  create it with the same partition type (usually 7, HPFS/NTFS)

[09:36] <mjbrooks> chr_, 13 + 8 = 23 if you account for formatting loss

[09:37] <chemaja> "take a look at my distro.... it's the only one i got.... not much of a distro.... doesn't seem to patch a lot"
[09:37] <ossm> Hi, I tried to upgrade my laptop at home to Feisty but it won't upgrade. I have a problem with the update manager not going away and packages not being able to be installed. A message comes up saying a distribution upgrade needs to be done to 6.10 but this doesn't seem to work. The upgrade to Feisty seems to take ages on the first stage and then just comes up with errors? Could anyone help?
[09:37] <tristanmike> ajax4: yeah, I've been there, it's not working for me :(
[09:37] <ExpositionOFEvil> did anyone else have problems with a cdrom drive?
[09:37] <chr_> sonictwin: GParted shows the devise as having 23GB used even after ntfsresize says it made the partition 13GB and that only 8GB of it are full.
[09:37] <OriginalGabriel> hey ... anyone have a moment to help me sort out a GRUB error, I'm trying to avoid having to slick the drive and reload everything
[09:37] <magnetron> FeistyAhoy: Ok, it ran just after the disk setup for me, from the "desktop" cd
[09:38] <Donovan_> Tomcat: I am running Feisty Server.  I need php4 for a custom web up for work (which opens n 3 hours, lol).  It was suggested I retrieve php4 from Edgy... hence I need to know how to install it... doh.
[09:38] <YNWA> alright, maybe this ain't my day... I'll seek help elsewhere then... :9
[09:38] <ajax4> tristanmike: Read it again, try this link to jump right to the relevant part: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats#head-053cb0af417294c03fea17f80b4e9f26924619f0-2
[09:38] <magnetron> !grub | OriginalGabriel
[09:38] <ubotu> OriginalGabriel: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[09:38] <Tomcat_> Donovan_: Why not just use the feisty php package?
[09:38] <mjbrooks> !anyone > OriginalGabriel
[09:38] <chr_> mjbrooks: what does that mean, I have a 30GB drive and I thought I resized the ntfs partition to 13GB
[09:38] <ajax4> Donovan_: sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb
[09:38] <tristanmike> ajax4: I've installed the gstreamer bad and ugly stuff, the ffmpeg stuff, the w32codecs, libdvdcss, and mozilla-mplayer and I get no streaming video, flash video I get, but no other video
[09:38] <Tomcat_> Donovan_: Install libapache2-mod-php4
[09:39] <Donovan_> Tomcat: There is no php4 in feisty, sadly :(
[09:39] <Amaranth> Donovan_: You're probably better off building it yourself
[09:39] <cables> Can anyone tell me if Ubuntu uses Suspend2?
[09:39] <Amaranth> Donovan_: but why doesn't php5 work?
[09:39] <Amaranth> cables: no
[09:39] <cables> Amaranth, k
[09:39] <jussi01> Donovan_, once you have a deb, then sudo dpkg -i deb name
[09:39] <Amaranth> cables: no reason to
[09:39] <ajax4> tristanmike: It tells you how to install "Ubuntu Restricted Extras" on that link I sent you. You need to try that next.
[09:39] <Donovan_> Application uses the unsupported feature $this-> which was yanked out from under everyone with php5 :)
[09:39] <OriginalGabriel> I just installed Feisty on a dual boot with XP and am getting an Error 18 at startup now ... I can only load the LiveCD now
[09:39] <magnetron> Donovan_, just double-click a deb-file to install
[09:40] <T0uCH>   Someone knows why does my screen becomes really dark when i install and activate nvidia 3d and driver after the restart?
[09:40] <tarelerulz> The part I am lost about is should gxine or mplayer play .vob files ?
[09:40] <ajax4> T0uCH: Try the #ubuntu-effects channel
[09:40] <magnetron> !nvidia | T0uCH
[09:40] <ubotu> T0uCH: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:40] <Donovan_> magnetron: Running server, no gui.  I'll give jussi01's command a try.
[09:40] <mjbrooks> chr_, you resized it to 13G  and how much is it saying is left?
[09:40] <Donovan_> jessi01: Thanks.
[09:40] <bayziders> How do you turn off beryl?
[09:40] <tristanmike> ajax4: oh, I think I missed that line...sorry, it's really late here, errr...early....duh, need coffee
[09:40] <tarelerulz> I got the codec from mplayers site
[09:40] <magnetron> Donovan_, ok, i missed that
[09:40] <ExpositionOFEvil> you have to remove it from ur startup
[09:40] <jussi01> Donovan_, no Probs
[09:41] <ExpositionOFEvil> sessions
[09:41] <Donovan_> Finally, presumably I must uninstall PHP5
[09:41] <ExpositionOFEvil> system;preferences;session
[09:41] <ExpositionOFEvil> and remove beryl
[09:41] <chr_> anyone have experience with fdisk on linux? I am trying to "shrink" a partition but im not sure what how to do it. I just ran ntfsresize and I get this msg: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16508/
[09:41] <tarelerulz> How do you tell if you have edgy or any other version of Ubuntu ?
[09:41] <ExpositionOFEvil> then aptitude remove beryl
[09:41] <bayziders> Okay but how do you turn it off?
[09:41] <ExpositionOFEvil> restart?
[09:41] <ferret_0568> !framebuffer
[09:41] <ubotu> If you would like information on framebuffers, please visit: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrameBuffer
[09:42] <ajax4> chr_: I would really use gparted instead. There is even a livecd version you can burn and boot into.
[09:42] <mjbrooks> bayziders, right click the beryl mamager icon in your tray and choose select window manager
[09:42] <Amaranth> chr_: I'd use partman
[09:42] <eck> chr_: you need to delete the old partition and create a new one with the correct size on top of it... if you can you should use a graphical program like gparted to prevent mistakes
[09:42] <K^Holtz> would this be the correct channel to ask for some help writing iptables rules?
[09:42] <zilly6_> what is the easiest way to install nvidia drivers?
[09:42] <DARKGuy> anybody here uses beryl? I wonder how can I run a program in a specific desktop (I want to run 4 programs separatedly, one in each cube side)
[09:42] <imonyse> Hi, all. I have used the alternative i386 cd image to install feisty. But it seems the install progress halted at 85% when package brltty-x11 is finished.  Does anybody have the same problem with me? Or should I try the desktop image instead......  >_<.
[09:42] <ajax4> zilly6_: in what version of Ubuntu?
[09:42] <Amaranth> zilly6_: In 7.04 it's just System->Administration->Restricted Drivers Manager
[09:42] <jin> hi, I'm on ubuntu deisty beta , how do I upgrade?
[09:42] <zilly6_> 6.10
[09:42] <jin> feisty*
[09:42] <willwill> zilly6: i'm using envy
[09:43] <jussi01> DARKGuy, #ubuntu-effects
[09:43] <Amaranth> zilly6_: In 6.10 install the nvidia-glx package and switch your xorg.conf driver from 'nv' to 'nvidia'
[09:43] <magnetron> !final | jin
[09:43] <ubotu> jin: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[09:43] <DARKGuy> jussi01: thanks
[09:43] <Erebus> Hi all
[09:43] <zilly6_> anyone know how to upgrade to feisty with the desktop ISO?
[09:43] <Amaranth> zilly6_: The desktop CD can only do clean installs
[09:43] <Erebus> Would anyone be able to help a n00b with an install problem?
[09:43] <zilly6_> k thanks amaranth ajax4
[09:43] <Amaranth> zilly6_: you need the alternative CD to do an upgradae
[09:43] <magnetron> !anyone | Erebus
[09:43] <ubotu> Erebus: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[09:43] <mjbrooks> !anyone > Erebus
[09:43] <chr_> eck: I guess I was not clear. This drive has a Windows partition on it That I want to save. That is why I was resizing it.
[09:44] <Amaranth> chr_: partman or gparted
[09:44] <Erebus> Heh
[09:44] <ajax4> chr_: gparted can resize windows partitions.
[09:44] <Amaranth> chr_: fdisk is _not_ what you want
[09:44] <Erebus> I get a "kernel panic" when installing
[09:44] <Erebus> On my desktop, laptop is fine
[09:44] <eck> chr_: you can resize it with fdisk, but if you get the cylinder counting off you could corrupt the FS, which is why it is better to not use fdisk
[09:44] <Erebus> But I see there's a new version out today .....
[09:44] <T0uCH> what does 71xx   96xx driver means ?
[09:44] <zilly6_> anyone know how to make a USB stick bootable?
[09:44] <eck> chr_: i have done it before if you need help, but you are really better off using another program
[09:44] <tristanmike> ajax4: ok, so that package is installed but I'm still having the same problem. Like, Apple Trailers just has a black screen
[09:45] <Erebus> Well, since I downloaded, day before yesterday
[09:45] <g35> hello, is it easy to install kubuntu on ubuntu once ubuntu is installed?  and also is it easy to switch between the two?
[09:45] <mjbrooks> !enter > Erebus
[09:45] <chr_> ajax4:  I am running the livecd but GParted thinks my drive id full and will not let me reduce the partition size.
[09:45] <Amaranth> T0uCH: It means "some driver that has a version that starts with 71 (like 7166)"
[09:45] <mjbrooks> g35, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:45] <g35> or more specific is it easy to install kde on ubuntu
[09:45] <ajax4> chr_: If the partition is full you can't reduce it unless you delete enough files to free up space on that partition.
[09:45] <T0uCH> ok... so if its for a graphic card.. i got a geforce 6200 its not in there?
[09:45] <Amaranth> g35: install kubuntu-desktop and you can switch between the two at login time
[09:46] <ajax4> g35: sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[09:46] <ExpositionOFEvil> arg
[09:46] <fluid> go go gadget apt-get! :O
[09:46] <jussi01> !attitude > mjbrooks
[09:46] <mntpng> my /dev/scd0 is cd burner and how do I check if DMA is turned on?
[09:46] <chr_> ajax4:  it is not really full, it only has 8GB on a 30GB disk, It is just that GParted thinks it is full
[09:46] <ajax4> chr_: Or move them to another drive, of course.
[09:46] <g35> but it seems ubuntu is more stable than kubuntu from what ive read so far
[09:47] <saispo> mntpng: use hdparm ?
[09:47] <mjbrooks> jussi01, hah
[09:47] <Amaranth> T0uCH: For the nvidia geforce 6200 you want the 9xxx driver (9631 or 9755)
[09:47] <chr_> eck: what program do you recommend?
[09:47] <mjbrooks> jussi01, nice find
[09:47] <ajax4> chr_: What happens when you try to reduce the partition size?
[09:47] <tristanmike> ajax4: ok, so that package is installed but I'm still having the same problem. Like, Apple Trailers just has a black screen
[09:47] <T0uCH> oki
[09:47] <mntpng> saispo: it doesn't seem to work for /dev/scd0 like devices
[09:47] <jussi01> mjbrooks, thats what you were after?
[09:47] <eck> chr_: if you want to do it manually you have to count out the tracks, starting with track 1 (not 0) for the first partition
[09:47] <ferret_0568> If I set a different framebuffer resolution in GRUB, like in this guide, do I have to update GRUB at all? If so, how? : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrameBuffer
[09:47] <Amaranth> T0uCH: In edgy you can use the 8776 driver (which works fine) and in feisty you can use either one of those 9xxx drivers
[09:47] <mjbrooks> jussi01, close enough for rocket science
[09:47] <Erebus> Will this new version (7.04) fix my kernel panic problem?
[09:47] <jussi01> :D
[09:48] <eck> chr_: i would normally use gparted
[09:48] <Amaranth> Erebus: It might
[09:48] <ferret_0568> Not sure Erebus, like Amaranth said, it might
[09:48] <mjbrooks> jussi01, man how'd I miss that, it was in the A's!
[09:48] <T0uCH> e-geforce 6200 LE     thats the full name
[09:48] <jussi01> hehe
[09:48] <valermos> Jordan_U, Hey, thanks again for the help. I finally got everything working through restricted-drivers. It turns out I had my xorg.con videoram set really low and it was causing some bizzare problems. Cheers!
[09:48] <T0uCH> it doesn't work good even in windows xp
[09:49] <ajax4> tristanmike: Try a bunch of different video files, if some play and others don't its most likely a codec issue. I can't really offer any more help than that.
[09:49] <ATi7500> hi all :)
[09:49] <Amaranth> T0uCH: Should work fine with the nvidia-glx package in 6.06, 6.10, and 7.04
[09:49] <tristanmike> ajax4: the video files play, on my computer, but I can't get any videos to play in my browser
[09:49] <what_if> anyone had problems with the desktop install with Nvidia ?? edgy never worked for me :(
[09:49] <chr_> ajax4: Using GParted? it will not let me make it any smaller that 23GB
[09:49] <Amaranth> T0uCH: but in 7.04 you can also try the nvidia-glx-new package which has the very latest version of the driver
[09:49] <mjbrooks> jussi01, saved me the embarrasment of being told I was suggesting a dupe keyword
[09:49] <ferret_0568> !nvidia | TOuCH
[09:49] <tristanmike> ajax4: that's what's weird
[09:49] <ytsestef> any1 know how to gonfigure alsa in ubuntu feisty?
[09:49] <T0uCH> ok.. i just need to install them in adept manager? or i got a few line to tap
[09:49] <odix> bahh
[09:49] <ubotu> TOuCH: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[09:49] <magnetron> what_if: works like a charm for me, better than edgy
[09:49] <ossm> Hi, I tried to upgrade my laptop at home to Feisty but it won't upgrade. I have a problem with the update manager not going away and packages not being able to be installed. A message comes up saying a distribution upgrade needs to be done to 6.10 but this doesn't seem to work. The upgrade to Feisty seems to take ages on the first stage and then just comes up with errors? Could anyone help?
[09:50] <odix> is the upgrade server bogged down or is it me ?
[09:50] <gharz> hi, guys.... i have upgraded from 6.10 to 7.04. now the final release is available... do i need to make some update? i did update-manager -d and nothing is avail. thanks
[09:50] <ferret_0568> Oh, in Feisty they have nvidia-glx-new?
[09:50] <odix> im on a 10mb line and g etting 14kbsec
[09:50] <mjbrooks> !slow > odix
[09:50] <ATi7500> someone with a good networking knowledge could join #ATi7500 please?
[09:50] <what_if> magnetron: my card does not work with the NV driver... just random colors :(
[09:50] <Danrarbc> yes the servers are getting hit hard
[09:50] <Amaranth> T0uCH: Just install the nvidia-glx package in adept then run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg' and tell it to use the nvidia driver
[09:50] <ajax4> chr_: That's odd. I've never experienced that problem.
[09:50] <Amaranth> T0uCH: then restart and it should all work
[09:50] <magnetron> !final > gharz
[09:50] <Danrarbc> the full release isos are also on most of those servers
[09:50] <ajax4> tristanmike: Hang on.
[09:50] <ferret_0568> ok, how do I remove NVIDIA's official (from their website) module?
[09:50] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: Yeah, nvidia-glx-new is the 9755 driver
[09:50] <ferret_0568> I have a GeForce 4
[09:51] <ferret_0568> Is it gonna work?
[09:51] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: the .run file can take an uninstall command
[09:51] <odix> so now that ive started i cant stop this update ?
[09:51] <gharz> magnetron, thanks!
[09:51] <T0uCH> which line i need to use to tell it to use the nvidia.. cause i tried this yesterday and it crashed the x sessions
[09:51] <magnetron> what_if: which card do you have?
[09:51] <noiesmo> tristanmike, in /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins are there libtotem files
[09:51] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: no, for a geforce 4 you want the nvidia-glx package, that is 9631
[09:51] <ferret_0568> odix; yup
[09:51] <what_if> magnetron: 7800
[09:51] <ferret_0568> I already have that one
[09:51] <tristanmike> noiesmo: ...checking....
[09:51] <noiesmo> tristanmike, i take it you have mozilla-mplayer installed
[09:51] <what_if> magnetron: an eVGA
[09:51] <tristanmike> noiesmo: yessir
[09:51] <Amaranth> odix: If you're just downloading you can stop it and resume where you left off later
[09:51] <odix> ferret? uhh? so if i rebooted now all would be lost? I'd rather d/l an iso and update from that
[09:51] <ferret_0568> But, I know the benefits
[09:51] <Amaranth> odix: If it's already installing things you can't stop it
[09:52] <magnetron> what_if: it's not a SLI, is it?
[09:52] <chr_> eck: I started by following the instructions on this site https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot and after I ran ntfsresize, this was the msg. I got http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16508/ Is this not a standard part of the process?
[09:52] <odix> its stil fetching
[09:52] <Amaranth> odix: Then you can stop it
[09:52] <what_if> magnetron: no, but I wish... \
[09:52] <odix> cool
[09:52] <ATi7500> someone with a good networking knowledge could join #ATi7500 please?
[09:52] <ajax4> tristanmike: Sorry man, pretty much out of ideas on your problem.
[09:52] <Amaranth> odix: But you'll want the alternative CD if you plan to use it to upgrade
[09:52] <tarelerulz> I have win32 package for mplayer from their site . SO I don't see why it will not work
[09:52] <bayziders> Wow fiesty has compiz built in O_O
[09:52] <bayziders> Epic win
[09:52] <Amaranth> odix: the Desktop CD can only do new installs
[09:52] <ferret_0568> if it has no stop button, odix
[09:52] <odix> amaranth, good info
[09:52] <tristanmike> noiesmo: I see both libtotem and mplayer plugin related .so and .xpt files
[09:52] <Amaranth> bayziders: Yeah, it's awesome :)
[09:52] <odix> i used force quit
[09:52] <ferret_0568> ok
[09:53] <tarelerulz> it says I have some kind of seeking problem and the file that is is looking for is not there in the win32 dir
[09:53] <bayziders> Compiz is nice, im used to beryl thou.
[09:53] <magnetron> what_if: well, can you install the restricted nvidia drivers after the Feisty install?
[09:53] <tristanmike> ajax4: I always appreciate the help, thank you :D
[09:53] <ferret_0568> a word of caution, it changed your software sources
[09:53] <bayziders> But it's built in great for new users
[09:53] <noiesmo> tristanmike, ok totem is clashing with mozilla-mplayer there are two things you can do 1 remove totem-mozilla and then reinstall mozilla-mplayer or two just remove the libtotem* files and re install mozilla-mplayer
[09:53] <Danrarbc> speaking of Compiz any way to have it allow rotating the cube using the middle mouse button? I'm just using Beryl cause I like that
[09:53] <Amaranth> bayziders: beryl is no more :)
[09:53] <Danrarbc> then again Beryl isn't unstable for me now
[09:53] <what_if> magnetron: shure I can, but the installer is just rendom colors blinking...
[09:53] <eck> chr_: gparted is a script on top of ntfsresize and fdisk, and since it does the error checking that is why it is recommended
[09:53] <ap1> How do I debug USB issues? Memory sticks? Hard disks? Good WIki pointer?
[09:53] <tristanmike> noiesmo: I'll try the former and if that don't work, I'm nuking the files :P
[09:53] <Amaranth> Danrarbc: That'd require a patch to the rotate plugin (so no, you can't do that)
[09:53] <bayziders> Amaranth: But this has like half the features.
[09:53] <what_if> magnetron: so getting to that point is a little rough
[09:53] <Danrarbc> alright
[09:53] <odix> hey i got a brainteaser, i run a wireless router on a 6mb line and on my wireless laptops i get over 1mbsec d/l and fast loading times, my direct computer is ubuntu, when i go to a webpage it sits there for like 30 seconds saying looking up "X"
[09:54] <ytsestef> ALSA configuration anyone?
[09:54] <ap1> !usb
[09:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about usb - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[09:54] <Amaranth> bayziders: You're probably looking for compiz-extra and gnome-compiz-manager
[09:54] <odix> but on my windows laptops awesome speed
[09:54] <noiesmo> tristanmike, sudo apt-get remove totem-mozilla && sudo apt-get install --reinstall mozilla-mplayer
[09:54] <Danrarbc> I figured as much cause i didn't see it in gconf
[09:54] <gharz> Amaranth, what do u mean beryl is no more? i'm currently using beryl since 6.10.
[09:54] <ferret_0568> How do I update GRUB? Do I need to if I change the framebuffer resolution in GRUB with this guide? : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FrameBuffer
[09:54] <eck> chr_: these are the notes i took when i did it manually: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16512/
[09:54] <bayziders> Apt get em?
[09:54] <Amaranth> gharz: beryl and compiz-extra are merging/merged
[09:54] <T0uCH> Amaranth:  can i paste you something in private?
[09:54] <tristanmike> noiesmo: already ahead of ya ;)  :D
[09:54] <gharz> Amaranth, ic.
[09:54] <Amaranth> gharz: there won't be anymore beryl releases
[09:54] <eck> chr_: this was with ext3, but in principle it is the same with ntfs
[09:54] <ATi7500> can someone help me to connect two computers each other?
[09:54] <noiesmo> tristanmike, oh and restart firefox :)
[09:55] <odix> ati, cant really
[09:55] <Amaranth> T0uCH: You have to be registered with nickserv to PM me
[09:55] <T0uCH> i am
[09:55] <odix> ati, buy a ethernet that has receiving and sending cable
[09:55] <Amaranth> T0uCH: Go ahead then
[09:55] <magnetron> what_if: well, a lot of people have no problem at all with that graphic card, I haven't heard of that error
[09:55] <tristanmike> noiesmo: af caurse :D

[09:57] <oxygen> help meee
[09:57] <odix> change the boot order
[09:57] <ExpositionOFEvil> cant
[09:57] <mjbrooks> fluid, welcome!
[09:57] <odix> in bios
[09:57] <odix> why not ?
[09:57] <ExpositionOFEvil> my external is not available
[09:57] <Amaranth> LaNCeloT_RW: Boot a desktop CD, mount your partition, and rename it back
[09:57] <ossm> ubuntu would rock more if i could get the update manager to work!
[09:57] <fluid> probably need two things, 1 to be able to boot from usb, and 2 to set that up in your bios ;)
[09:58] <odix> is it usb ?
[09:58] <Amaranth> !ask | oxygen
[09:58] <ubotu> oxygen: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[09:58] <noiesmo> ExpositionOFEvil, is it usb then you will need to tell your bios to boot frm usb i would think
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> yeah
[09:58] <LaNCeloT_RW> Amaranth;  i 'll try to do that.. thanks
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> usb is not a choice =/
[09:58] <ferret_0568> Do I need to update grub if I change /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
[09:58] <odix> removable media isnt a choice ?
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> is it removable hardware?
[09:58] <tristanmike> ferret_0568: relax friend, I'm very aware of the no caps rule, but my excitement got the better of me :P  Just making darn sure everyone knows it, and how awesome the support is, but thanx for being on the ball :D
[09:58] <oxygen> Amaranth, : i want to install mod_python for apache
[09:58] <magnetron> oxygen: use Synaptic to install it
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> yeah
[09:58] <fluid> if i plug my psp or archos into this laptop, i get "no operating system found" after post.
[09:58] <odix> yes.
[09:58] <oxygen> but i cant documetion
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> but thats 2nd priority
[09:58] <odix> change it to first
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> 1st is cdrom
[09:58] <mjbrooks> ossm, are you getting a specific error?
[09:58] <oxygen> i need configuration
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> 3rd is harddrive
[09:58] <LaNCeloT_RW> Amaranth;  what is the complete comand to mount my partition hda1 as RW ?
[09:58] <oxygen> document
[09:58] <what_if> ferret: it reads on boot, so no
[09:58] <ExpositionOFEvil> and it still doesnt
[09:58] <Amaranth> oxygen: install the libapache-mod-python package
[09:59] <ossm> mjbrooks: it just times out on the first stage of the upgrade to feisty
[09:59] <ajax4> gtg...later guys
[09:59] <LaNCeloT_RW> which*
[09:59] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, it works ? if so please help me to guide me to configure that video playing on my browser too :P
[09:59] <gharz> guys, anybody here who's using network-manager-pptp? i can't connect to vpn. after entering username and password, nothing happens.
[09:59] <mjbrooks> ossm, the servers are under a heavy load
[09:59] <bayziders> vlc's video play back doesn't work in compiz =/
[09:59] <oxygen> Amaranth, : configuration ?
[09:59] <magnetron> oxygen: use Synaptic to install libapache2-mod-python or libapache-mod-python
[09:59] <mjbrooks> !slow | ossm
[09:59] <ubotu> ossm: The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.
[09:59] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: sure, no problem
[09:59] <Amaranth> LaNCeloT_RW: sudo mkdir /media/hda1 && sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /media/hda1
[09:59] <what_if> gharz: found it  http://linuxlookup.com/2007/apr/05/compiz_and_beryl_reunited_officially
[09:59] <ossm> mjbrooks, i will try again later this evening but i have been having issues with the update manager not installing certain updates
[10:00] <Amaranth> oxygen: For problems with mod_python beyond installing it this probably isn't the right place
[10:00] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: where are you at, have you installed any packages yet ?
[10:00] <Amaranth> oxygen: Perhaps #apache or #python would be more helpful
[10:00] <gharz> what_if, thanks
[10:00] <jin> !java
[10:00] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
[10:00] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, just installed the mozilla mplayer plugin
[10:00] <paroneayea> dammit... module-assistant auto-install rt2500-source fails...
[10:00] <drumline_> Just look for a mirror that has some bandwidth...  I found one that gave me 100k/s
[10:00] <jin> wow, firt time getting 1.2MB/s on bittorrent
[10:00] <mjbrooks> ossm, this is the first full day with Feisty, you may need a bit more patience than usual when it comes to timing out
[10:00] <paroneayea> for that matter so does compiling any other module
[10:00] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: ok, search for "totem-mozilla" and make sure that's not installed
[10:00] <xjkx> is there a linux software that converts to AMV ? i think mencoder doesnt :>
[10:00] <JensenDied> what is a recommend mta?
[10:01] <ferret_0568> Does bootchart conflict with Sun Java 6 JDK?
[10:01] <ossm> mjbrooks, no problem, thanks for your help
[10:01] <Donovan_> Does dpkg not automatically resolve dependencies?
[10:01] <ExpositionOFEvil> odix wouldnt it work if it was infront of the harddrive?
[10:01] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: bootchart and java have nothing in common, why would it?
[10:01] <jussi01> Donovan_, it should...
[10:01] <Amaranth> Donovan_: no, that's what apt is for :)
[10:01] <deepsa> Donovan_: naw
[10:01] <jussi01> oopd
[10:01] <jussi01> s
[10:01] <mjbrooks> !best | JensenDied
[10:01] <ubotu> JensenDied: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose among a number of different applications, depending on your preferences, the features you require, and other factors.
[10:01] <Amaranth> Donovan_: dpkg is like rpm, it just installs things
[10:02] <xjkx>  AMV is the format my mp4 (like an ipod, but is NOT an ipod) understands
[10:02] <Amaranth> Donovan_: it's up to apt or some other app to make sure things get installed in the right order
[10:02] <ferret_0568> bootchart uses gcj
[10:02] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, ok it's uninstalled now ... do you have any linked video to test ?
[10:02] <JensenDied> mjbrooks: I was looking for a recommendation, you know, to try different ones out =D
[10:02] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: that's a new one
[10:02] <ferret_0568> apt has never failed
[10:02] <fluid> anyone have the document repository url handy? im fat and lazy. lol...
[10:02] <Donovan_> Amaranth: Ah.  I'm a spoiled Gentoo user, lol
[10:02] <magnetron> info ffmpeg | xjkx
[10:02] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: so it does
[10:03] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: I just use any trailer off of quicktime.... http://www.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/faygrim/trailer/
[10:03] <ferret_0568> Good for you
[10:03] <Amaranth> ferret_0568: but you can have gcj and java installed at the same time
[10:03] <magnetron> !info ffmpeg | xjkx
[10:03] <ubotu> xjkx: ffmpeg: multimedia player, server and encoder. In component universe, is optional. Version 3:0.cvs20060823-3.1ubuntu4 (feisty), package size 176 kB, installed size 620 kB
[10:03] <newtonviet> list
[10:03] <ferret_0568> ok, will it override Sun Java as the default Java using /etc/defaults?
[10:03] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, muhahaha... it works thanks a ton
[10:03] <mjbrooks> JensenDied, sendmail, qmail, postfix, exim
[10:03] <ferret_0568> I guess there would be a debconf question
[10:03] <xjkx> you sure ffmpeg converts to amv? amv is a very rare format ! magnetron
[10:04] <ferret_0568> I'll try it...
[10:04] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: don't thank me, thank noiesmo, he's the one with the big brain ;D
[10:04] <JensenDied> mjbrooks: thanks will look into some of those
[10:04] <ferret_0568> My JDK isn't mission critical
[10:04] <ferret_0568> I'm just learning Java
[10:04] <fluid> only bad thing about this install is that i have to force beryl to render through copy...which makes it slower than it should be :(
[10:04] <ferret_0568> I'm not in college or anything, I'm young
[10:04] <splatch> personne ne peut m'aider ???
[10:04] <Amaranth> xjkx: I don't think ffmpeg will do it either
[10:04] <magnetron> xjkx: i don't know, but i have heard it is good at converting between a lot of formats, even formats for mobile phones. check it out!
[10:05] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, right with out big brains, we small brains will never thought of that out :P
[10:05] <Amaranth> magnetron: AMV is a chinese-only format similar to MP4
[10:05] <newtonviet> could somebody help me how to get the Cube after enable Desktop effects, etc.
[10:05] <Amaranth> newtonviet: The checkbox doesn't work?
[10:05] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: so true :P
[10:05] <magnetron> Amaranth: oh, maybe i'm over my head here :D
[10:05] <paco49> hello
[10:06] <newtonviet> Yes, I did check the box and  could not figure out how to use the cube
[10:06] <ExpositionOFEvil> hey
[10:06] <paco49> are ubuntu en mirrors down?
[10:06] <ExpositionOFEvil> not all
[10:06] <ferret_0568> I'm gonna try adding vga=791 to the kernel command line
[10:06] <fluid> newtonviet: hold ctrl-alt and hit left or right arrow just to be sure it flips
[10:06] <Amaranth> newtonviet: ctrl-alt-left/right
[10:06] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, does it work with embeded music playing as well ?
[10:06] <magnetron> !slow > paco49
[10:06] <newtonviet> 1st time I hear about it and want to try
[10:06] <ferret_0568> brb
[10:06] <paco49> ok
[10:06] <gustavo> hi
[10:07] <gustavo> i need help compiling the kernel, someone?
[10:07] <fluid> you can do ctrl-alt-shift + left/right to move the focused window back and forth with you as well (if thats set by default ... didnt play with stock compiz at all)
[10:07] <paco49> i have a problem with dapper, i want shell in french but he is in english
[10:07] <paco49> but graphic (gnow) is in french
[10:07] <paco49> just consol shell is in english
[10:07] <newtonviet> Thanks, now it is OK
[10:07] <paco49> how correct that?
[10:07] <Ademan> is there a LIGHT package for testing php on your local machine?  I'd rather not install apache
[10:07] <Ademan> gustavo: why are you compiling your kernel?
[10:08] <gustavo> Ademan, because i want :)
[10:08] <eck> chr_: here is how i calculated the offsets, if you still want to do it by hand: http://wiki.eklitzke.org/doku.php?id=tech:partitions
[10:08] <Ademan> gustavo: is that your sick and twisted idea of fun? :-p
[10:08] <ExpositionOFEvil> I HATE my computer!
[10:08] <medinfo> gustavo, have you tried to google how to compile kernel? :p
[10:09] <berent> First of all congrats to all bringing Feisty Fawn
[10:09] <berent> :-)
[10:09] <Ademan> ExpositionOFEvil: your burner not work?
[10:09] <gustavo> where is my bzImage or vmlinuz image ? i cant find it.
[10:09] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: I haven't tried but I assume
[10:09] <Bhaskar1> I have no internet, i have uninstall openoffice, now i need it , how can i install it, i have live CD of ubuntu 6.06lts
[10:09] <ubuntu_noob> noiesmo, should I uinstall totem since I am using mplayer ?
[10:09] <ExpositionOFEvil> my cdrom drive creates errors reading the cd im guessing
[10:09] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: as long as mplayer supports it
[10:09] <Ademan> gustavo: vmlinuz should be in root ( / )
[10:09] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: no, you shouldn't uninstall it
[10:09] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: In Synaptic: add the CD repository
[10:10] <gustavo> i know, but im saying the one that came with my new kernel
[10:10] <rellik> sorry for the repeat question, but can someone remind me how you check which version you are running to confirm the dist-upgrade?
[10:10] <Hairulfr> Ok, I need photoshop. Anyone have a tight grip around vmware/virtualbox other software, where I could be able to run Photoshop through? (can't get it to work via wine)
[10:10] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, em... couldn't play embeded wmv and mp3
[10:10] <fluid> Hairulfr, whats wrong with the gimp? :P
[10:10] <magnetron> rellik: lsb_release -d
[10:10] <gustavo> medinfo: its done, i just need to know where is my image :(
[10:10] <rellik> magnetron, thanks
[10:10] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: gives a link, I'll try here
[10:11] <KoZi2> is there a site for help tutorials for 7.04
[10:11] <ap1> How do I use my encrypted Kingston USB disk stick? Is there a driver to decrypt it? Why does it not show in mounts or desktop, but shows in Places/Computer?
[10:11] <Hairulfr> fluid: Workflow ;) it just takes too long, I can do pretty much the same, only slower and a lot more bothersome :)
[10:11] <bomanizer> anyone done the up from edgy -> feisty using update manager?
[10:11] <Hairulfr> KoZi2: www.ubuntuguide.org - that'll be your god
[10:11] <gustavo> i just can find on /arch/i386/boot why i cant find it on /arch/x86_64/boot ?
[10:11] <KoZi2> ty Hairulfr
[10:12] <Hairulfr> KoZi2: No problem
[10:12] <Meshezabeel> heya, is there a cd/dvd burner program that comes with ubuntu?
[10:12] <jussi01> Hairulfr, have you considered gimpshop?
[10:12] <Hairulfr> jussi01: I don't even know what that is?
[10:12] <gharz> bomanizer, i did
[10:12] <ExpositionOFEvil> gimp creators hated the gimpshop
[10:12] <tristanmike> !burner | Meshezabeel
[10:12] <ubotu> Meshezabeel: CD/DVD Burning software: K3b (KDE), gnomebaker, serpentine, graveman, Nautilus cd burner (Gnome), gtoaster, xcdroast, cdrecord (terminal-based). Burning .iso files: see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto
[10:13] <magnetron> Meshezabeel: yes, it is integrated in the desktop
[10:13] <jussi01> Hairulfr, http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294
[10:13] <fluid> looks like photoshop 8 works in wine. have not tried that at all though.
[10:13] <fluid> says that 8 works better than 7 and 9
[10:13] <sonictwin> this is a funny error i just got...
[10:13] <paroneayea> gimp creators hate all who disagree with their idiotic paradigm
[10:13] <Hairulfr> fluid: Yeah, I have CS, it starts, then breaks down just after everythings been loaded
[10:13] <g35> hello, if i have a windows ntfs partition taking over my whole hard drivea already, is it possible to install ubuntu on that same hard drive by allocating the free space of the NTFS parition to a new partition for ubuntu?
[10:13] <sonictwin> Window manager warning: Received a _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE message for 0x2600003 (cdrom0); these messages lack timestamps and therefore suck.
[10:13] <mneptok> paroneayea: excuse me?
[10:14] <tarzeau> paroneayea: they are responsible for gtk!
[10:14] <g35> while keeping windows?
[10:14] <paroneayea> sorry, that was rude of me :)
[10:14] <paroneayea> no, I understand that the gimp developers have done a lot
[10:14] <mjbrooks> fluid, from what I hear any version of photoshop runs as long as it isn't the Newer "CS" branded ones
[10:14] <LaNCeloT_RW> hi dudes, thanks Amaranth
[10:14] <magnetron> g35: yes, that's what i did
[10:14] <mjbrooks> fluid, so no CS  CS2 or CS3
[10:14] <paroneayea> and at least the gimp is moving in the right direction.  I'd rather it go in the direction that inkscape went though
[10:14] <LaNCeloT_RW> but now, how can I fix that: LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library /usr/local/firefox32/plugins/libflashplayer.so [libdl.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory] 
[10:14] <fluid> according to winehq.com, cs works fine.
[10:14] <paroneayea> as in inkscape -> sodipodi
[10:14] <LaNCeloT_RW> Using: Feisty AMD64
[10:14] <Hairulfr> g35: Yes, its possible and quite easy, you need to shrink your partition with a program like Partition MAgic
[10:14] <Amaranth> !firefox32
[10:14] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about firefox32 - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:14] <paroneayea> er
[10:14] <Amaranth> dang
[10:14] <paroneayea> said that backwards ;)
[10:15] <foxiness> can i say hi :) ?
[10:15] <jussi01> I have had cs working in crossover...
[10:15] <ExpositionOFEvil> Xara Xtreme  > Inkscape
[10:15] <bomanizer> quit

[10:15] <bomanizer> wtf
[10:15] <bomanizer> ok
[10:15] <mjbrooks> bomanizer, /quit
=== willwill_ is now known as willwill
[10:15] <LaNCeloT_RW> Amaranth;  i've already followed the guide at help.ubuntu.com (AMD java and flash) on Edgy worked but not in Feisty, any clue ?
[10:16] <bomanizer> gharz: any problems?
[10:16] <entilzha> Price(Xara) >>> Price(Inkscape)
[10:16] <Amaranth> LaNCeloT_RW: Nope, my suggestion is to use the 32-bit version of Ubuntu
[10:16] <ExpositionOFEvil> Xara Xtreme  = free
[10:16] <LaNCeloT_RW> Amaranth;  =/ .. ok
[10:16] <Amaranth> LaNCeloT_RW: The Ubuntu developers will probably never implement true multiarch since it's only needed for closed-source software
[10:16] <Hairulfr> jussi01: Is there a package somewhere or do I need to compile myself? (gimpshop)
[10:16] <paroneayea> ExpositionOFEvil: ooh, I had forgotten about that project
[10:17] <paroneayea> I remember the early announcements
[10:17] <dystopianray> LaNCeloT_RW: I also recommend 32-bit ubunu rather than 64-bit
[10:17] <bomanizer> mjbrooks: i was a captive of the help menu ^_^
[10:17] <jussi01> Hairulfr, feisty or edgy?
[10:17] <Amaranth> LaNCeloT_RW: you do have the ia32-libs package or whatever installed, right?
[10:17] <Hairulfr> jussi01: Feisty
[10:17] <LaNCeloT_RW> Amaranth;  yes, i have them...
[10:17] <gharz> bomanizer, i didn't find any problem.
[10:17] <LaNCeloT_RW>  /lib32
[10:17] <gharz> bomanizer, and i'm still using it now.
[10:17] <jussi01> Hairulfr, on the website i gave you, about the 4th line down...
[10:17] <Hairulfr> jussi01: Oh, wait, the osx one is for X11, that would work I guess
[10:17] <LaNCeloT_RW> i followed the guide, like i did on edgy
[10:17] <bomanizer> gharz: ok, thx
[10:18] <gharz> bomanizer, oh... there's one... network-manager-pptp doesn't work for me.
[10:18] <ap1> Kinston Datatraveler USB stick drivers? can not find in Kingston Web site. It is encrypted, so need a special driver...
[10:18] <zilly6_> guys, i see a lot of examples on how to create a persistent bootable linux USB stick, but how do i just copy and ISO to the stick and get it to boot?
[10:18] <Enselic_> What pros/cons are there with running the i386 version on my Ahtlon 64 x2 4200+?
[10:18] <gharz> bomanizer, i can't connect to a network.
[10:18] <ExpositionOFEvil> omg I forgot about the upgrade ability
[10:18] <mosi|work> how easy is it to make an install image of ubuntu for use on say 10 machine
[10:18] <dj-bino> hallo zusammen
[10:18] <Enselic_> I have the AMD64 versino now, but there are some problems
[10:18] <jussi01> Hairulfr, no, dont use the OSX one
[10:18] <bomanizer> gharz: k
[10:18] <entilzha> Xara has a free trial.. Not the same
[10:18] <mosi|work> i want them all to have identical programs and settings from the start
[10:18] <zilly6_> Enselic_ i'm running 386 (on X2), it seems fine so far
[10:19] <bomanizer> gharz: i'm hovering over the 'update' button...
[10:19] <fluid> i know i saw a post that said you can get flash player 9 working on amd64 earlier
[10:19] <magnetron> Enselic_: con - not optimal speed . pro - all the restricted packages
[10:19] <|Z_E_R_O|> anybody with e2fcsk problems?
[10:19] <fluid> nspluginwrapper was used...want me to find it and throw out a url?
[10:19] <jussi01> Hairulfr, http://www.plasticbugs.com/blogimg/gimpshop_2.2.11-1_i386.deb
[10:19] <Hairulfr> jussi01: FOund it :) Wow, I got so used to apt-get that this is frightening and a disturbing world, downloading from at HP
[10:19] <jussi01> lol
[10:19] <Meshezabeel> magnetron, tx for the cd/dvd help :)
[10:19] <Enselic_> magnetron: is the speed difference notable though?
[10:19] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, sorry, was afk, the link is in a forum which has restricted registration
[10:19] <gustavo> zilly6_, it will be better if u are using a k8 kernel :)
[10:20] <bomanizer> gharz: these laptops can be triky, you have desktop or lappy?
[10:20] <magnetron> Meshezabeel: np =)
[10:20] <ExpositionOFEvil> err I cant upgrade =/
[10:20] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: ok, did you install the gstreamer0.10 packages ?
[10:20] <zilly6_> gustavo, what about certain apps and plugins like the flash plugin?
[10:20] <diabolix_> ok.. so i think dbus just died on me.. it seems to be running, but nothing can connect. and the worst part is the gnome services thing doesn't work now. i was disabling things in there and everything stopped working.
[10:20] <gharz> bomanizer, laptop
[10:20] <ExpositionOFEvil> Software Updates just crashed
[10:20] <fluid> i have not tried this for flash player 9 on amd 64...am doing it now: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=341727
[10:20] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, yes
[10:20] <bomanizer> gharz: k
[10:20] <gustavo> zilly6_, yeah, really, that sucks :(
[10:20] <gharz> bomanizer, i upgraded when feisty was still beta
[10:20] <ccfiel> hello pll is geforce 6200. ubuntu friendly?
[10:21] <tristanmike> ok, how about the "Medibuntu" repos, did you add the w32codecs ?
[10:21] <ExpositionOFEvil> I think so
[10:21] <dystopianray> ccfiel: all nvidia cards are
[10:21] <zilly6_> gustavo, is there a way to have both kernels?
[10:21] <Hairulfr> ccfiel: It should be yes :)
[10:21] <commonlyUNIQU3> <3 Fiesty!!!
[10:21] <bomanizer> gharz: ok
[10:21] <ExpositionOFEvil> all?
[10:21] <gustavo> sure...
[10:21] <magnetron> Enselic_: you will not notice the difference i think
[10:21] <ExpositionOFEvil> naw
[10:21] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
[10:21] <gustavo> zilly6_, sure...
[10:21] <dystopianray> zilly6_: you only need -generic
[10:21] <bomanizer> gharz: the network manager... what kind of shite it was giving?
[10:21] <gustavo> zilly6_, sure... it always let the older kernel avaiable
[10:21] <ubuntu_noob> tristanmike, I have w32codec installed..
[10:21] <gustavo> *available
[10:21] <ako3> haiii all
[10:22] <ako3> any body from indonesia?
[10:22] <zilly6_> right now i'm just trying to set up a usb stick with feisty installer
[10:22] <diabolix> soo.. i think dbus is messed up.. i cannot run the gnome services manager thing to check.. something weird is going on becaus alot of stuff that uses dbus isn't working, but dbus seems to be running...
[10:22] <magnetron> ako3: hi
[10:22] <ccfiel> Hairulfr: i will buy one today. coz my ati 6250 is not support in restricted driver.
[10:22] <ExpositionOFEvil> why do my cd's last longer than my drive! ER
[10:22] <gharz> bomanizer, it doesn't connect... though i was able to find a profile (nm-applet)... when i select the profile it doesn't do anything.
[10:22] <dj-bino> hallo alle zusammen
[10:22] <commonlyUNIQU3> quick feisty question:  how do you add codecs (e.g. ubuntuguide.org used to suggest to apt-get a bunch of gstreamer plugins...
=== knack is now known as knackster
[10:22] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: hmm.....I'm not sure then...
[10:22] <ako3> magnetron, u are from indonesia?
[10:22] <dystopianray> ccfiel: that should be supported, which driver did you use?
[10:22] <magnetron> !de > dj-bino
[10:22] <adriaticator> after upgrading to Feisty my dual screen setup doesn't work. It makes two different desktops on each screen and I can only use one. It no longer works as one big desktop.
[10:22] <magnetron> ako3: no
[10:22] <bomanizer> gharz: k, thans.. i'm off to the forums, these damn irc channels are too frantick for me :)
[10:23] <ako3> so...from where u are?
[10:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> does anyone know how to boot from removable media?
[10:23] <tristanmike> ubuntu_noob: did you do this "Click Applications  Add/Remove. In the top right, change the setting to "All available applications". Then select Other in the left panel and then select the Ubuntu restricted extras package. Click OK."
[10:23] <fluid> well this channel is frantic because its super busy tonight ;)
[10:23] <jussi01> ExpositionOFEvil, change your bios settings
[10:23] <magnetron> !offtopic | ako3
[10:23] <ubotu> ako3: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[10:23] <ExpositionOFEvil> its set infront of harddrive
[10:23] <diabolix> how do i enable services without the gnome thing?
[10:24] <gustavo> how can i download a kernel from apt and dont install it?
[10:24] <ExpositionOFEvil> I think I have to put cd same time I start computer
[10:24] <ExpositionOFEvil> or something
[10:24] <dAndy> gustavo: you mean kernel source?
[10:24] <diabolix> is there some kind of rc.config file somewhere?
[10:24] <jussi01> ExpositionOFEvil, you should have the cd in at boot, and have it set in bios to boot from the cd
[10:25] <gustavo> dAndy,  yeah
[10:25] <ExpositionOFEvil> yeah it was
[10:25] <dAndy> gustavo: apt-get install linux-source
[10:25] <Hairulfr> Argh! Nothing works and I don't want to boot into windows
[10:25] <ccfiel> dystopianray: in my ATI card 9250. i used the open source but no tv out :( and in restricted driver its not supported so i will buy one today i want to make sure the one i will buy will run smoothly (6200) do you think?
[10:25] <dAndy> gustavo: it puts the kernel source tarball in /usr/src/linux iirc
[10:25] <jussi01> Hairulfr, whats the prob?
[10:25] <ExpositionOFEvil> but it doesnt read from the cd until ubuntu is fully started
[10:25] <gustavo> dAndy, no, i mean download a package and dont install it automatically
[10:25] <magnetron> !grub > Hairulfr
[10:25] <ExpositionOFEvil> bios doesnt detect the cdrom drive
[10:25] <dystopianray> ccfiel: oh, you currently have a ati card?
[10:26] <dystopianray> ccfiel: I thought you meant you have a nvidia 6250 currently
[10:26] <jussi01> ExpositionOFEvil, that sucks man
[10:26] <ExpositionOFEvil> why did I get this 200 dollar drive!
[10:26] <ExpositionOFEvil> omg

[10:26] <jussi01> ExpositionOFEvil, go and buy the $20 from walmart...
[10:26] <jussi01> :P
[10:26] <Hairulfr> jussi01: I need do lighten/dareken foreground/background independently and the selection tools are horrid. "Magicwand" just gets to a maximum where it doesn't want to select anymore, lassoselect moves the magiwand-selectd areas instead of adding to the selection... Gah!
[10:27] <ccfiel> dystopianray: i currently have an ati 9250 :( is not supported in restricted.
[10:27] <OGR> I aging one-legged whore from Russia, Fuck me man's

[10:27] <stockfisch> how do i format and wipe a hd?
[10:28] <fluid> Hairulfr: did you get that guide i linked for 32bit compatibility, and nsplugin wrapper to get flash player 9 working?
[10:28] <jussi01> Hairulfr, that sucks, have you tried out crossover office?
[10:28] <dystopianray> ccfiel: it should, yes, it's a very low-end card though
[10:28] <magnetron> stockfisch: u can use the desktop cd for that
[10:28] <jussi01> they have a free trial on their website
[10:28] <OGR> =|[::`danny::] |=> fuck me... bad boy..

[10:29] <stockfisch> magnetron, i have used it to repartition the disk, but i would like to securely wipe and format it to fat32
[10:29] <Hairulfr> jussi01: No, I haven't, I need the power that photoshop gives... :(
[10:29] <fluid> Hairulfr: someone said something about flash player 9 and java on amd64...oh well. hehe...
[10:29] <jussi01> Hairulfr, yeah, crossover is a refined form of wine
[10:29] <LaNCeloT_RW> Hairulfr;  Feisty 32-bit or 64-bit?
[10:29] <magnetron> !torrents | zilly6_

[10:32] <Supaplex> any gdb gurus about?  In gdb, "bt full" only shows three frames, and "thread apply all bt full" shows none.  What gives? Is there a better way to capture a good stack trace on all threads? (eg, bugreport)

[10:33] <dystopianray> duncan_: is it intel-hda audio?

[10:33] <dystopianray> duncan_: is ati using intel-hda chipsets?
[10:34] <soho> question: if i write sudo + command in the terminal then bash-completion don't work how can i change this?

[10:34] <ryancr> does any know what happened to the i810 modesetting driver?
[10:34] <OiPenguin> Congrats with the release of 7.04! Finally my Wireless card is working and I'm enjoying the exploration. How do I install Opera on 7.04. They have not listed a 7.04 version, may I use a previous version? See http://www.opera.com/download/
[10:35] <dystopianray> ryancr: xserver-xorg-video-intel
[10:35] <ryancr> ah thank you
[10:35] <Zues_62> does anyone knw bout alsa?
[10:35] <dystopianray> OiPenguin: it may possibly work, but i'd recommend you wait till they release a feisty version
[10:35] <commonlyUNIQU3> OiPenguin: you can install opera by adding some repos
[10:35] <jussi01> OiPenguin, I think you need the 9.2 version
[10:35] <Madpilot> ubotu, opera | OiPenguin
[10:35] <ubotu> OiPenguin: opera is an advanced and free (only as in price) web browser.  Install it via Applications->Add/Remove..., making sure that "Show commercial applications" (dapper only) is checked. For more info on opera please see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OperaBrowser
[10:36] <AnRkey> Zues_62, whats the problem with alsa?
[10:36] <tsurc> The MD5SUMS.gpg... whats it for?
[10:36] <chr_> eck:  Thanks, I seem to get a decimal number http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pc1GGEuhuZ5v_V030Kxj2Yw&output=html&gid=0&single=true
[10:36] <OiPenguin> dystopianray: thanks
[10:36] <Zues_62> anrkey i have to config the kernal coz of my soundcard
[10:36] <ryancr> dystopianray: exactly what i was looking for..thanks again
[10:36] <Zues_62> anakey and when i do make it has an error
[10:36] <jussi01> tsurc, it shows you the md5sums for the disks
[10:36] <Bhaskar1> i want to install office package from ubuntu cd coz i have no office package installed on my ubuntu, so how can i install office package only from cd
[10:36] <dystopianray> ryancr: it has lots of issues though, like X crashing when you change resolution
[10:36] <dystopianray> ryancr: and vt switching not working correctly
[10:36] <duncan_> dystopianray: can you solve the problem/do you know how to fix
[10:36] <OiPenguin> ubotu: Still, should I wait for 7.04 release?
[10:37] <jussi01> Bhaskar1, open office or microsoft?
[10:37] <dystopianray> duncan_: intel-hda is broken on feisty
[10:37] <dystopianray> duncan_: it may get fixed in a later update
[10:37] <AnRkey> Zues_62, don't know enough about kernel patching sorry
[10:37] <fulat2k> hi folks, can someone recommend software to rip and edit audio stream from a VOB file?
[10:37] <jussi01> !ubotu | OiPenguin,
[10:37] <ubotu> OiPenguin,: I am ubotu, all-knowing infobot. You can browse my brain at http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl - Usage info: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots
[10:37] <magnetron> !feisty | OiPenguin
[10:37] <ubotu> OiPenguin: FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[10:37] <duncan_> so till then I can't uses my audio?
[10:37] <tsurc> thought that was the MD5SUMS file, I guess its to verify it... but how do I do it.
[10:37] <ryancr> dystopianray: well i was using it on the 'herd' releases and it was working great for me.. so hopefully it hasn't changed to much in the last week or so
[10:37] <commonlyUNIQU3> ^ that sucks
[10:37] <Zues_62> anakey would it mean they need to update on there end
[10:37] <dystopianray> duncan_: there are solutions on the forums that involve compiling alsa yourself
[10:37] <OiPenguin> I don't appreciate Evolution and miss Opera Mail dearly. Are there any alternative applications with the same mail sorting system as Opera (similar to gmail)?
[10:38] <ap1> Hey, if I mount /dev/sda or sda1 or sda2 as usbfs it "works", but only shown some system file hierarchy with "001 002 devices..." etc... how to access my USM memory?
[10:38] <duncan_> Ok, I'll find some thanks
[10:38] <jhaig> OiPenguin: You could use Opera Mail.
[10:38] <dystopianray> ap1: usbfs is the wrong fielsystem
[10:38] <dystopianray> ap1: you don't ever use usbfs as a user
[10:38] <jussi01> OiPenguin, there is a version of opera that works on feisty, i have used it
[10:38] <dystopianray> ap1: your drive most likely has a fat32 partition

[10:40] <jussi01> Bhaskar1, I think there is a meta package, wait one
[10:40] <zurita> guys my wifi doesnt work, what could i do?
[10:40] <drumline_> jin: what part is slow?
[10:40] <commonlyUNIQU3> I installed 7.04 on a P3 laptop w/ 128MB of memory - would I get any better performance by using xfce instead of gnome?
[10:40] <OiPenguin> Jussi: http://www.opera.com/download/ They don't list a Feisty version, which one do I choose.
[10:40] <magnetron> !wireless > zurita
[10:40] <maddler> jin: I was saying the opposite... dunno...
[10:40] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, i could not install from Synteptic package manager , it is fir online i want to install offline
[10:40] <jhaig> OiPenguin: The Edgy version should work.

[10:41] <jin> drumline_, when gnome start

[10:41] <jin> and launching firefox is slower
[10:41] <bayziders> Can you make avant zoom on mouse over?
[10:41] <OiPenguin> Thanks. Is there any risk in testing. I've only used Ubuntu last three hours and won't be able to corrects problems if they occur ;-)
[10:41] <arooni> should i wait to go from edgy to feisty?
[10:41] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, no it search internet
[10:42] <drumline_> jiv: hmm...how much slower?
[10:42] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: use apt-cdrom in a terminal

[10:43] <gerry_> hello

[10:44] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, apt-cdrom openoffice.org
[10:44] <donfilipo> magnetron any cure?
[10:44] <Bhaskar1>  could not work
[10:44] <gnomefreak> donfilipo: there is a .deb for realplayer
[10:44] <gerry_> does desktop effects work on default installation for ati card?

[10:45] <gerry_> compiz
[10:45] <LaNCeloT_RW> fluid;  thanks man!!!
[10:45] <Hegge> A Question: Installing Ubuntu 7.04 without cd, is that done in the same manner as the older rels? as described on the homepage
[10:45] <Hairulfr> "% this, I'm writing Adobe
[10:45] <ferret_0568> !framebuffer | ferret_0568
[10:45] <LaNCeloT_RW> fluid;  now, what about java did you get it working?
[10:45] <Frogzoo> any big showstoppers with feisty?
[10:45] <magnetron> !update | Hegge
[10:45] <ubotu> Hegge: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[10:45] <Trist_an> gerry_, for ATI you have to install Xgl usually. At least under Edgy...
[10:45] <gnomefreak> !install | Hegge
[10:45] <ubotu> Hegge: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues - See also !automate
[10:46] <Hegge> gnomefreak: i will take that as a yes =)
[10:46] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, apt-get cdrom install openoffice.org
[10:46] <Bhaskar1>  not work
[10:46] <bayziders> What does the water effect in compiz do? I can't seem to get it to work?
[10:46] <bayziders> I have it set to super and control but when I press them nothing happens
[10:47] <Dreamless> !feisty
[10:47] <ubotu> FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[10:47] <Frogzoo> bayziders: you need to configure actions to generate a water event - likemovig a window
[10:47] <gnomefreak> Hegge: read the link because im not sure how rel did it
[10:47] <AnRkey> bayziders, water effects
[10:47] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: first add the cd with apt-cdrom, then use synaptic to install openoffice
[10:47] <dimebar> bayziders: hold ctrl + super and move your cursor round on the desktop
[10:47] <Thor> I attempted to upgrade to Feisty using the update manager GUI and I had an error in the install script for the nvidia driver.
[10:47] <gerry_> Trist_an:  last time, i delete all compiz stuff and enable beryl-project reps and install xgl ,it works, but i don't know whether things have changed in feisty final
[10:47] <Thor> I was told to report a bug about it.
[10:48] <Trist_an> gerry_, but can you have desktop effects?
[10:48] <gnomefreak> Thor: do that please. there are now 3 nvidia drivers in feisty
[10:48] <gerry_> Trist_an:  i have beryl+xgl installed,  it worked for me
[10:48] <Hegge> gnomefreak : oki.. well i have red the link, the question is: has it changed in the new rel and they havent had time to change the information on the homepage
[10:48] <jussi01> Thor, did you report a bug?
[10:48] <Thor> gnomefreak: It's running a recovery now, I didn't take a copy of the specific error message, what files should I dump in the bug report?
[10:48] <gnomefreak> Hegge: yes
[10:49] <Trist_an> gerry_, so I don't understand your question
[10:49] <Dell-Net> i have nvidia beryl + aiglx works like a charm
[10:49] <Hegge> but i will give the program recomended on the homepage a try
[10:49] <Hegge> thanks gnomefreak
[10:49] <bayziders> O_O it completly locks up my system.
[10:49] <Trist_an> gerry_, unless if you want to know if you can have Beryl/Compiz without Xgl on ATI. I think it is not possible
[10:49] <Thor> jussi: no, but I'm about to.
[10:49] <bayziders> and does nothing
[10:49] <gnomefreak> thepumpkin1979: /var/log/dist-upgrade
[10:49] <Hairulfr> Same here. Nvidia/Bery no problems at all
[10:49] <gnomefreak> no
[10:49] <babo> Is gimp in the ubuntu core ?
[10:49] <gnomefreak> Thor: /var/log/dist-upgrade
[10:49] <cables> babo, yep
[10:49] <Hairulfr> babo: Yes
[10:50] <gnomefreak> babo: ubuntu-desktop
[10:50] <dimebar> bayziders: hmm - its supposed to make a 'wave' behind the cursor.  the other one (i forget the command) makes ripples like rain on the desktop
[10:50] <Trist_an> anyone has Xgl+ATI+Beryl under feisty? Is it working and what repo do you use?
[10:50] <Hairulfr> alt + f2 gimp
[10:50] <Thor> gnomefreak, thank you
[10:50] <enry> only a question all was working with the 3d cube...after 3 minutes the cube is not rotating and i cannot switch from a workarea to another
[10:50] <Thor> bah, now my task bar is locking up again
[10:50] <gerry_> Trist_an:   i followed the howto http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Feisty_with_XGL,it's not supported by ubuntu
[10:50] <gnomefreak> Thor: yw
[10:50] <babo> what about inkscape ?
[10:50] <Dell-Net> any linux program as visio in office ?
[10:50] <gnomefreak> Thor: there should be 3 files in there please attach all 3
[10:50] <Thor> that could be Beryl's fault though.
[10:50] <cables> babo, it's in the repositories, easily installable.
[10:50] <OiPenguin> Opera 9.20 for Edgy eft installed successfully on Feisty! Thanks.
[10:50] <magnetron> enry: in the lower right corner, how does it look?
[10:51] <Thor> gnomefreak, ok
[10:51] <gustavo> how do i use mkinitrd ?
[10:51] <Dell-Net> use aiglx with ubuntu no xgl
[10:51] <jhaig> Dell-Net: There are a couple.  Kivio, I think.
[10:51] <gerry_> i want a working compiz or beryl for default installation
[10:51] <Dell-Net> jhaig: gonna check it out
[10:51] <cables> gerry_, Compiz is installed out of the box in Feisty.
[10:51] <Hairulfr> gerry_: It already is
[10:51] <jhaig> Dell-Net: I think Dia is another.
[10:51] <babo> is feisty stable released ?
[10:51] <cables> gerry_, first it'll prompt you to install the drivers, then you'll need to reboot, then you can enable the effects.
[10:51] <babo> thanks btw :-)
[10:51] <enry> magnetron all application 3d are workin it's only the cube...simply it stop working after 5 minutes i have attivate it
[10:51] <Trist_an> babo yes
[10:51] <cables> babo, yep
[10:51] <Hairulfr> babo: Yes
[10:51] <brutopia> hello everybody, can I somehow make dpkg to force default options to kde package so I could get feisty's default background and stuff when I'm upgrading from edgy with apt dist-upgrade
[10:51] <knoppix> hi all
[10:51] <gerry_> cables:  Compiz seems not supporting my ati card
[10:52] <knoppix> test knoppix
[10:52] <knoppix> it s working?
[10:52] <brutopia> is there something like dpkg-reconfigure force-defaults or some other tool?
[10:52] <jussi01> Hairulfr, how did crossover go?
[10:52] <Thor> okay, the system seems to have gone bananas.
[10:52] <babo> :-) ... what are the chances of it getting my laptop microphone to work ? And/or clearing up my touchpad issues ?
[10:52] <cables> gerry_, do you have the drivers installed? Go to System>Administration>Restricted Drivers Manager to check.
[10:52] <Trist_an> Why Compiz by default and not Beryl?
[10:52] <Kakurady> Hi everyone. Will I get axed if I ask if I can ask?
[10:52] <knoppix> hello?
[10:52] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, could not get success
[10:52] <cables> Trist_an, it's more stable
[10:52] <Trist_an> Kakurady, yes
[10:52] <cables> !ask | Kakurady
[10:52] <ubotu> Kakurady: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:52] <darkhack> morning all
[10:52] <slackern> !ask | Kakurady
[10:52] <deepsa> well the repo's still slow.
[10:52] <babo> Is it just out recently then ? Is there a recommended upgrade tutorial ?
[10:52] <Hairulfr> jussi01: The Adobe splash opened, that was it, now I have no clue how to start the damn thing again.
[10:52] <gerry_> cables; you mean fglrx? sure
[10:52] <cables> gerry_, yeah
[10:53] <crazy_penguin> Hello!
[10:53] <mjbrooks> !ask | Kakurady
[10:53] <matason> Is there the slightest chance that if I install madwifi that my atheros wifi card might give me more than 6.5 kB/s data transfer?
[10:53] <babo> Will it upgrade to the latest kernel ?
[10:53] <babo> feisty that is ...
[10:53] <Trist_an> babo from edgy you can do  gksu update-manager -c -d in terminal I think
[10:53] <Bhaskar1> Anybody can help me for install openoffice from ubuntu CD
[10:53] <Kakurady> I see that now. - I've got Beryl and XGL installed with my system. Do I need to uninstall them before I do a dist-upgrade?
[10:53] <gregorovius> hi, can anyone tell me how to dump the output of a program into a file, please?
[10:53] <DarkX> !effects
[10:53] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about effects - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[10:53] <DarkX> !beryl
[10:53] <cables> Bhaskar1, OpenOffice is installed by default with Ubuntu.
[10:53] <jhaig> gregorovius: command > file
[10:53] <Thor> i think Beryl,th at I instaled on top of Edgy, isn't liking the upgrade very much...
[10:53] <phire> how do I get amarok to play mp3's in feisty?
[10:53] <Kakurady> I don't think it will help...

[10:54] <Dell-Net> beryl
[10:54] <shwag> can I get apt-get install beryl ?
[10:54] <cables> !mp3 > phire
[10:54] <cables> shwag, yep
[10:54] <flamebird> I dont get it
[10:54] <Trist_an> babo, I'm not under Feisty yet but I was told it is the best way
[10:54] <shwag> because the beryl wiki says to do other stuff.
[10:54] <Hairulfr> jussi01: Now it let me select langauge, and then disapperede... Got further with wine....
[10:54] <gerry_> cables:  compiz not work out of box even i have installed fglrx drivers
[10:54] <cables> shwag, on feisty you just need to make sure your video drivers are installed and apt-get install beryl
[10:54] <slackern> Is there anyone here using a X1950 card and got some form of better performance than the regular vesa drivers? I've tried about every driver out there both from repos and made them from ati.com but they all perform worse than vesa.
[10:54] <flamebird> Ubuntu was released but then I use the update manager it says my system is up to date!!!!
[10:54] <shwag> cables: should I not enable Desktop Effects (..uhmm..compiz?)  if im just going to do beryl ?
[10:54] <flamebird> any ideas!
[10:54] <enry> ok the cube is not working
[10:54] <darkhack> In beryl, when I made my buttom panel transparent with alt + mouse scroll, but when restarting the pc, it went back to normal. So, is there a way to save the trasparent panel in beryl?
[10:54] <Hairulfr> enry: Did you enable it?
[10:54] <cables> shwag, you can if you want... but disable them before you install beryl
[10:55] <shwag> cables: I wonder why the beryl wiki doesnt explain you can just apt-get it now by default.
[10:55] <flamebird> enry, open gconf editor and make the desktop to 4
[10:55] <enry> Hairulfr, it worked only for 5 minutes
[10:55] <danikhan> whats the default kernel version in fiesty
[10:55] <shwag> cables: cool.
[10:55] <cables> shwag, maybe it's for feisty?
[10:55] <flamebird> enry, check the forum
[10:55] <protocol1> is there a way I can fix my ATI lockup issue?
[10:55] <gregorovius> does the 'saving to a file' happen when all commands finish executing?
[10:55] <flamebird> Ubuntu was released but then I use the update manager it says my system is up to date!!!!
[10:55] <cables> !info linux-generic feisty | danikhan
[10:55] <ubotu> danikhan: linux-generic: Complete Generic Linux kernel. In component restricted, is optional. Version 2.6.20.15.14 (feisty), package size 23 kB, installed size 52 kB
[10:55] <flamebird> any ideas!
[10:55] <gerry_> danikhan: 2.6.20-15
[10:55] <Kakurady> Flamebird: you should see a message telling you a ner version of the system is available  and there's a upgrade button beside it
[10:55] <shwag> cables: yah...thats my point...its for Feisty
[10:55] <slackern> protocol1, i saw ati released new drivers yesterday that fixes lockup issue with AGP cards
[10:55] <protocol1> I am using an ATI all-in-wonder 9800 pro card
[10:55] <danikhan> thx gerry
[10:55] <shwag> cables: maybe an older version of feisty
[10:55] <Hairulfr> enry: Right click the red ruby and cehck if it still says "Beryl"/compiz" under "Window manager" (if you do use Beryl)
[10:55] <cables> flamebird, make sure you hit the check version
[10:55] <gregorovius> because it's a long process and I need to see the beginning of the log, but it scrolls too fast
[10:56] <protocol1> slackern, really?
[10:56] <flamebird> kkerwin, I cant see it
[10:56] <cables> flamebird, i mean button, not version :)
[10:56] <flamebird> cables, i did
[10:56] <cables> gregorovius, less
[10:56] <enry> flamebird, ok i will all ather effect are working correctly
[10:56] <Kakurady> cables, where's the "check version" button?
[10:56] <protocol1> slackern, can you help me out?
[10:56] <cables> gregorovius, put | less after the command
[10:56] <slackern> protocol1, 8.36.5 is the version of them
[10:56] <babo> so `gksu update-manager -c -d` is the recommended upgrade path then yes ?
[10:56] <cables> Kakurady, sorry, the check button, not the check version button.
[10:56] <Dell-Net> yes
[10:56] <gregorovius> i'm gonna try it out, thanks everyone
[10:56] <cables> babo, you shouldn't need to do that, it should come up by itself...
[10:56] <protocol1> slackern, wow....how do I go about instlling those?

[10:57] <darkhack> any solution?
[10:57] <flamebird> cables, there is no check version button just check
[10:57] <Kakurady> Huh? Oh. I see, I usually use synaptic.
[10:57] <babo> Hairulfr, I'm upgrading from dapper ...
[10:57] <Hairulfr> enry: So just using the Desktop effects?
[10:57] <cables> flamebird, that's what i said!

[10:57] <enry> Hairulfr, yes
[10:57] <protocol1> ok
[10:57] <protocol1> will try that out
[10:57] <shwag> is it normal that im getting all these apt-get errors about  "packages cannot be authenticated!"  ?
[10:57] <Hairulfr> enry: Do you have Nvidia or ati?
[10:57] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, i did apt-cdrom -d=/media/cdrom then go to package manager and check for openoffice, it still search to connect net
[10:57] <babo> Hairulfr, oops, I meant I'm on edgy.
[10:57] <enry> Hairulfr,  intel
[10:57] <slackern> protocol1, ahh they have updated the wiki for the latest version now i see

[10:58] <protocol1> slackern, thx for the help my friend
[10:58] <Hairulfr> babo: Try Sudo apt-get update and the sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[10:58] <enry> Hairulfr,  it's trange the cube worked well for only 5 minutes than it stop like it hane only one worktable
[10:58] <babo> Hairulfr: does it work ? I'll check the forums now anyway ...
[10:59] <slackern> protocol1, np, hope it helps, my x1950 card i will just smash with a hammer :)
[10:59] <protocol1> slackern, I will let you know how it works out
[10:59] <protocol1> :)
[10:59] <babo> Hairulfr, yeah, I can see it in the upgrade. Which is the recommended path. I seem to remember one way being better than the other for the last upgrade ...
[10:59] <magnetron> enry: use gconf-editor
[10:59] <ikonia_> has this channel been flooded with fesity "how do I" questions yet ?
[10:59] <gerry_> java didn't work in beryl?
[10:59] <slackern> protocol1, i'm almost thinking of sticking my old 9800 card back into my machine
[10:59] <Hairulfr> babo: Do it the upgrademanager way :)
[10:59] <Kakurady> How much data will be downloaded in the upgrade from Edgy to Feisty (with both Kubuntu+Ubuntu installed)?
[11:00] <magnetron> !feisty | ikonia_
[11:00] <ubotu> ikonia_: FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[11:00] <ikonia_> magnetron I know its out
[11:00] <Hairulfr> enry: don't know much about the deafault desktop effects thing, I think Beryl works on intel, so you should get that instead, it's better, imo
[11:00] <matason> How do I identify what driver my wifi card is using?
[11:00] <babo> Hairulfr, so from the upgrade/install gnome widget then yes ?
[11:00] <enry> magnetron,  and what i have to do with?
[11:00] <donfilipo> folks thanks installation of RealPlayer deb package works great...thanks again!
[11:00] <ikonia_> magnetron hence why I was asking if the channel has been bombared
[11:00] <magnetron> ikonia_ : just pulling your leg
[11:00] <ikonia_> magnetron ahhh sorry
[11:00] <ikonia_> magnetron went over my head
[11:00] <stiffme1983> it seems that 2.6.20-15 is a BUGGY kernel
[11:00] <TommyTom> great... new error. i got my soft raid working but i always run into this problem "The ext3 file system creation in partition #8 of LVM VG via_deheacejdg, LV via_deheacejdg failed." when formating my ext3 for mount point / (i.e. root)
[11:00] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 why do you say that
[11:01] <Frogzoo> is there much breakage in the upgrade from edgy to feisty?
[11:01] <Hairulfr> babo: Yes, I'd think so. Although I prefer clean installs
[11:01] <Hairulfr> !upgrade
[11:01] <ubotu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:01] <darkhack> do yall really use realplayer?
[11:01] <babo> ah, k thanks
[11:01] <ikonia_> TommyTomb are you using the installer to try to put ubuntu onto a software raid device wrapped with lvm ?
[11:01] <hobe> Can I expect my internet connection (ADSL with Alcatel Speedtouch 330) to work ater upgrading to feisty? I mean after the upgrade to dapper, the firmware directory had changed. Is there anything similar to expect?
[11:01] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:'cause first, no sound but it seems my hardware works fine
[11:01] <Hairulfr> darkhack: No, but it works if you need it
[11:01] <gnomefreak> Frogzoo: that really depends on the packages installed
[11:02] <jenda> How do I generate a structured list of directories (something like ls -R would give me) without the files (just directories?)
[11:02] <T0uCH> I want to format all my hard disk ( windows and feisty all) if i choose with the installation of windows (after formating) to use all disk in 1 partition canse i use ubuntu too?
[11:02] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 is it possible you've just not configured it, or ubuntu didn't detect it right and there is "no problem" with the kernel
[11:02] <gnomefreak> Frogzoo: its not too bad though
[11:02] <Thor> okay, i found a similar bug
[11:02] <Frogzoo> gnomefreak: kk, thx
[11:02] <magnetron> enry: use gconf-editor to edit /apps/compiz/general/screen0/options, hsize =4
[11:02] <Thor> was it a bad idea of me to use Envy to install nVidia drivers?
[11:02] <gnomefreak> yw
[11:02] <Thor> should I remove those and try again?
[11:02] <ikonia_> T0uCH you will lose your boot sector
[11:02] <Thor> Envy was the only simple option i found for Edgy.
[11:02] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:second, kernel ramdonly freezes with error output:ata1:failed to respond(30secs Status 0xd0)
[11:02] <gnomefreak> Thor: yes
[11:02] <TommyTom> ikonia_: i have no idea. all i know is i have a raid already setup. i used DMRAID to recognize it. i tried formating in the installer app and from windows and neither work. get same error since the installer forces me to format
[11:03] <ikonia_> jenda I think there is an option within "lndir"
[11:03] <T0uCH> ok
[11:03] <Thor> gnomefreak: does Feisty install those same drivers for me without me having to mess about with tools like that?
[11:03] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:no ,kernel detects my sound card right, on the screen it looks right
[11:03] <darkhack> so, there's no way to save my trasparent panel in beryl mode???
[11:03] <ikonia_> TommyTom my personal opinion is that dmraid is not a good call
[11:03] <Zer0> any idea when the stable version of feisty is coming to the automatic updater (for us still running the beta)?
[11:03] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:the only question is that no sound is out
[11:03] <gnomefreak> Thor: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx depending on your card
[11:03] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 I doubt thats a kernel issue to be honest
[11:03] <Hairulfr> drakhack: What do you mean? The panel can be transparent
[11:03] <slackern> Zer0, you probably have it already if you keep yourself updated
[11:04] <Zer0> oh, thanks, hehe
[11:04] <Dreamless> Zer0 it does
[11:04] <gnomefreak> Thor: is taht easy enough?
[11:04] <Zer0> how do i check?
[11:04] <seamus7> Hi... I want to use Network Manager but it's not currently showing up in my notification area ... How do I go about getting it to automatically activate upon boot?
[11:04] <gnomefreak> that*
[11:04] <copper> hi
[11:04] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:but my sound card works fine when i use 2.0.20-13-generic
[11:04] <Dreamless> Zer0 system -> administration -> upgrade manager (or something im on danish feisty here)
[11:04] <Thor> gnomefreak: i could actually go through hours of compiling libraries and such, but I'm a fan of convenience.
[11:04] <Bhaskar1> magnetron,  rightclick and override which version to use this idea did not work, wht it is difficult to install openoffice from CD
[11:04] <TommyTom> ikonia_ what do you suggest then. i finally got it to "work" with dmraid. and it seemed easy enough. and im completely nub to linux
[11:04] <Sandwalker> Has anyone got Microsoft TrueType fonts working in Feisty?  If so, how?
[11:04] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 are you using fesity
[11:04] <Thor> gnomefreak: (I'm a programmer myself)
[11:05] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:yes ,with final release
[11:05] <Analemma23> Hey, what's the best ubuntu irc client???
[11:05] <stiffme1983> ikonia_:fresh installed
[11:05] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: what do you mean "it did not work"?
[11:05] <BalchD> Hi, is there a MD5 checksum or similar I can get to verify my Fiesty ISO is ok?
[11:05] <ikonia_> TommyTom I would suggest using software raid, and not using lvm for your root file systems
[11:05] <knoppix> cineva care intelege ro?
[11:05] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 log a bug then
[11:05] <copper> any idea why my IDE drive suddently got handled by a scsi driver when upgrading to ubuntu on one laptop, but not on another laptop?
[11:05] <magnetron> !best > Analemma23
[11:05] <Zer0> i meant if i could see the version number of the current build or something, i get the updates whenever they come up
[11:05] <slackern> Analemma23, nice nick
[11:05] <copper> drives actually
[11:05] <shwag> cables: where is beryl-manager ?
[11:05] <jhaig> Analemma23: Define 'best'.  :-)  A lot of people use Gaim, I think, because it is installed by default.
[11:05] <seamus7> BalchD: K3B will do that automatically ... but you do need to download the md5sum to check it against
[11:05] <ikonia_> copper libata now recognises all hard disks through the ata library as scsi
[11:05] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, not work
[11:05] <Hairulfr> copper: It's probably ide on on and sata on the other. My sata is handled by scsi
[11:05] <stiffme1983> ikonia_: i want to report bug at first,but someone did it already
[11:06] <TommyTom> ikonia_: from what i understand though, software raid i would have to wipe the whole array. i can do that. 400gb gone :(
[11:06] <slackern> Analemma23, i prefer xchat myself, some like irssi, bitchx etc etc
[11:06] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 update the bug with your input then
[11:06] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, it aslo search for internet
[11:06] <copper> Hairulfr: those are both old laptops, both IDE only
[11:06] <TommyTom> cant*
[11:06] <darkhack> <Hairulfr> I meant when I'm running beryl and I use a+mouse scroll to make my panel transparent, but when restart pc, it went back to normal. I'm not tlaking about the transparent from panel property.
[11:06] <ikonia_> TommyTom backup
[11:06] <BalchD> seamus7: I don't know where to get the MD5...
[11:06] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: that's all the support i can give
[11:06] <knoppix> hello
[11:06] <cables> shwag, what do you mean by where?
[11:06] <ikonia_> TommyTom or use dmraid with iout lvm
[11:06] <cables> !md5 | BalchD
[11:06] <ubotu> BalchD: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[11:06] <tomix> upgrade or re-install for version 7? does it really make any difference?
[11:06] <shwag> cables: it didnt get installed i guess.  I just did  apt-get install beryl
[11:06] <darkhack> <Hairulfr> alt+mouse scroll I meant
[11:06] <stiffme1983> ikonia_: actually i solved the sound bug, by compiling alsa driver and alsa lib myself
[11:06] <cables> shwag, just hit alt-f2 and run it.
[11:06] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, have u ever install from CD?
[11:06] <TommyTom> ikonia_: i would if i even knew what LVM was
[11:06] <Hairulfr> darkhack: Ok, you need to set a specific value for the panel in beryl-settings manager. Give me a sec
[11:07] <cables> shwag, it installed it for me... hmm.
[11:07] <cables> shwag, there's an ubuntu-beryl package you should install too.
[11:07] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: yes
[11:07] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 so report that into the bug report, the problem is not the kernel but the alsa interface
[11:07] <hagabaka> with the new version of xorg-driver-fglrx in Feisty, is it required to blacklist the fglrx module?
[11:07] <seamus7> BalchD: the ubuntu download page will have a list somewhere of all available downloads including the MD5SUM for each ...
[11:07] <Analemma23> Thanks guys, I am trying xchat, didn't know gaim did irc as well.
[11:07] <copper> ikonia_: any idea why my drives are still handled as IDE on my other laptop?
[11:07] <cables> Analemma23, it doesn't do it well. Gaim's IRC is really nasty.
[11:07] <ikonia_> copper different version of ubuntu
[11:07] <copper> ikonia_: same
[11:07] <copper> both feisty
[11:08] <ikonia_> copper which version ?
[11:08] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, why not working so
[11:08] <copper> latest
[11:08] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: you tell me
[11:08] <tomix> upgrade or re-install for version 7? does it really make any difference?
[11:08] <BalchD> Ah, got it now, thanks seamus7 & cables!
[11:08] <ikonia_> copper thats very strange, what type of disks are in the the none scsi machine
[11:08] <Hairulfr> darkhack: Go to Window Management>Set windows attrib by various criteria> grab you just pick the panel and the set the opacity
[11:08] <stiffme1983> ikonia_: ok, how about the ata1 error? it makes kernel freeze about 30secs
[11:08] <ikonia_> tomix do it and tell us
[11:08] <copper> ikonia_: normal IDE drives
[11:08] <shwag> is it normal that im getting all these apt-get errors about  "packages cannot be authenticated!"  ?
[11:08] <hobe> So there is no known problem with the ADSL modem from Alcatel?
[11:08] <jimcooncat> need a simple iso burning app, have a borked xubuntu dapper right now
[11:08] <TommyTom> !lvm
[11:08] <ubotu> Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[11:08] <ikonia_> copper and your sure its your harddisk that showing like that - and not a cdrom
[11:08] <Analemma23> cables thanks, I'm just wanting to shunt the joins and quits to a different window... then I think xchat would be ok for me...
[11:09] <Hairulfr> darkhack: Grab using window type (select in the box to the left)
[11:09] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 looks like a driver error - again log a bug report
[11:09] <copper> ikonia_: both the hard drive and the DVD-ROM drive are handled as IDE
[11:09] <cables> does anyone know if libpam-keyring needs any setup further than just installing the package?
[11:09] <copper> /dev/hda and /dev/hdc
[11:09] <stiffme1983> ikonia_: i compiled the original 2.6.20 from kernel.org, problem still remains
[11:09] <ikonia_> copper where they both clean fesity installsor updates
[11:10] <K^Holtz> if i wanted to do something like only allowing a certain type of traffic from a specific IP, and block all others... would i first write the iptables rule that allows from the specified ip, then write a block all rule for that traffic under it? or would the block all rule just overshadow the allow rule i wrote above it?
[11:10] <vimalg2> Can anyone tell me if there is a command-line switch or some hack/workaround that allows APT-GET to resume broken downloads? I cannot stress this enough because my ISP only provides dial-up in my area. I've been trying to download Eclipse from the repositories for a very long time. Please help!
[11:10] <copper> ikonia_: yes
[11:10] <spikeb> jimcooncat, gnomebaker will do it
[11:10] <Hairulfr> darkhack: Got it working?
[11:10] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 thats because ubuntu uses the same kernel as kernel.org so if there is a driver error in that kernel - it will still be in that kernel if you build it your self
[11:10] <ikonia_> copper I'm doing some investigation, thats very unusual from what I'd expect
[11:10] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, i am in trouble from 2 days, that i could not install from CD , to install openoffice only from CD
[11:11] <copper> ikonia_: actually, the difference is that on the first laptop, the one where drives are recognized as scsi drives, was first upgraded to the latest beta of feisty
[11:11] <cables> vimalg2, you can find out what packages eclipse needs, then download them from packages.ubuntu.com with a download manager that can resume downloads.
[11:11] <ikonia_> copper you said they where both clean installs of fesity
[11:11] <legs11> hi all
[11:11] <magnetron> Bhaskar1: maybe you could find an internet connection and download the packet
[11:11] <stiffme1983> ikonia_: actually at first, i thought the ata1 problem is caused by ubuntu patch to kernel
[11:11] <copper> ikonia_: ikonia_ clean upgrades, yes
[11:11] <seamus7> Hello... will deleting the contents of /etc/network/interfaces allow Network Manager to activate on reboot? It's currently not showing up in the notification area.
[11:11] <ikonia_> stiffme1983 I'm not aware of any ata patches
[11:11] <ikonia_> copper clean upgrades ???
[11:11] <ikonia_> copper how was both installed
[11:12] <jimcooncat> thanks spikeb
[11:12] <copper> ikonia_: the first one, edgy 6.10 -> feisty beta -> feisty
[11:12] <vimalg2> cables: Is there any proxy or something i could install locally to cache partial downloads/requests from apt-get?
[11:12] <arooni> how can i uninstalle eclipse?
[11:12] <copper> ikonia_: the second one, edgy 6.10 -> feisty
[11:12] <ikonia_> copper and the second
[11:12] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, i want to install offline, from CD
[11:12] <cables> vimalg2, i'm not sure, sorry...
[11:12] <copper> I clicked on the "upgrade" button like anyone else
[11:12] <foug> 7.04 is very good guys! no problems so far, and most problems I had in 6.10 are now fixed with Feisty. If you havn't upgraded I suggest you do. If you're a dev, thanks for making a good os
[11:12] <cables> Bhaskar1, the CD has OpenOffice built into it.
[11:12] <ikonia_> copper ok - the atabranch that handles scsi ---> ide conversion may have been removed int he beta, I don't know at this moment int time I'll have to check when I get home
=== knack is now known as knackster
[11:12] <steven43126> vimalg2, and webproxy should do and make sure you use http sources
[11:13] <cables> Bhaskar1, when you install Ubuntu from the CD, it has OpenOffice installed already.
[11:13] <Amec> When I try to upgrade to Feisty, it stops at fetching file 108 of 114, then after a few mins, it continues then gives me and error then crashes. Can anyone help me with this please?
[11:13] <copper> ikonia_: it's the other way around
[11:13] <ikonia_> copper that should read - been removed in the stable release
[11:13] <Hairulfr> Amec: What is the error ?
[11:13] <copper> the laptop that was first upgraded to the beta is the one that's handled as scsi
[11:13] <ikonia_> copper I've just corrected myself
[11:13] <slackern> Amec, it could be that the servers are a bit overloaded right now
[11:13] <copper> ikonia_: ah ok
[11:13] <Amec> I don't know, I'm trying for the 4th time... I'll tell you when it returns the error.
[11:13] <Bhaskar1> cables, ya ,but i uninstall office once a time, so i want to install it again
[11:14] <ikonia_> copper there was a serious kernel error just days before release - that may have been one of the issues, I don't know off the top of my head, I'll have to investigate when I get home
[11:14] <compengi> how can i get static ip configuration work on Feisty?
[11:14] <ikonia_> compengi use the network configuration gui and set one
[11:14] <copper> ikonia_: ok, thanks :)
[11:14] <magnetron> !guidelines | Bhaskar1
[11:14] <richard-blaine> hello guys, any pointer as to where to get MD5SUM of the DVD iso (7.04)
[11:14] <ubotu> Bhaskar1: The people in this channel are volunteers. Your attitude will determine how fast you are helped. See also http://wiki.ubuntu.com/IrcGuidelines
[11:14] <copper> WAY too many people in this chan :-/
[11:14] <ikonia_> richard-blaine on the ubutnu download sites
[11:14] <compengi> ikonia, i don't have internet when i setup that
[11:14] <magnetron> !repeat > Bhaskar1
[11:14] <ikonia_> compengi thats because you can't set static IP's - your ISP has to set you one
[11:15] <ytsestef> Amarok says there's no mp3 support, asks me too install, then locks up and I have to kill it... can I do anything?
[11:15] <Thor> hehe, there should be load balancing for #ubuntu, like, you'd get redirected to one of several rooms.
[11:15] <gustavo> hi! how do i prevent kernel panic happening when compiling a kernel?
[11:15] <pukkie> ques, is there somewhere I can find the differences between server and desktop? The installers on the CD's are different and such, but what's actually different for the rest? do they use different repositories/start up scripts/etc?
[11:15] <Bhaskar1> magnetron, so
[11:15] <ikonia_> gustavo you learn how to build a kerenl ?
[11:15] <compengi> ikonia, nope that's not the issue, i got a router. and on edgy it works fine but on feisty no
[11:15] <Thor> gustavo: that should not happen, basically.
[11:16] <richard-blaine> ikonia : i cant seem to find any mentioning about dvd iso on the download site (or maybe i didnt look hard)
[11:16] <slackern> ytsestef, i read about it yesterday if you are in KDE it will download the correct codecs but you can also install the codec packages manually but im not sure about the names of them =/
[11:16] <hagabaka> on http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Feisty_Installation_Guide#Method_2:_Install_the_8.36.5_Driver_Manually , in the Method 2 section there's a paragraph about blacklisting the fglrx module, but it says it's only needed with Method 1. is that a typo?
[11:16] <Thor> gustavo: I guess something's awry in your currently running kernel, but I doubt it's related to compiling the new kernel.
[11:16] <ikonia_> richard-blaine you didn't look hard
=== Thor is now known as THJ
[11:16] <ikonia_> Thor I think he means a panic in the one he's trying to build, not the running kernel
[11:16] <darkhack> <Hairulfr> sorry it took me long to respond, but how do I set the buttom panel.
[11:16] <ikonia_> thor when he boots fromt he one he's built
[11:16] <THJ> ikonia: lol
[11:16] <THJ> ikonia: that might be it
[11:16] <T0uCH> does anybody knows how to unload the xorg because of overwrite possibility due to customize configuration?
[11:17] <ikonia_> T0uCH I have no idea what you mean by that question
[11:17] <gustavo> Thor: ive compiled a kernel, but it does not boot, because of kernel panic...
[11:17] <cables> !fr | T0uCH, maybe there's someone in here that could help
[11:17] <orbin> !server > pukkie  (see PM from ubotu)
[11:17] <ubotu> T0uCH, maybe there's someone in here that could help: Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[11:17] <ikonia_> gustavo in that case you need to lean how to build kernels properly
[11:18] <gustavo> iknonia ive did it so many times without any problem :)
[11:18] <ikonia_> gustavo and ask yourself the question - why are you building your own kernel 99 out of a 100 people will have no issues
[11:18] <THJ> gustavo: ah, like ikonia reckoned. i'm curious, why do you need to compile a kernel?
[11:18] <darkhack> <Hairulfr> oh nevermind, I got it.
[11:18] <gustavo> ikonia ive did it so many times without any problem :)
[11:18] <ikonia_> gustavo then you don't need to ask how to fix it
[11:18] <darkhack> <Hairulfr> Thanks alot
=== Shadowp is now known as Shadowpillar
[11:18] <THJ> I consider myself a power user and I never needed to compile a new kernel for any modern Linux.
[11:18] <Hairulfr> darkhack: No problem, err.
[11:18] <gustavo> learning porpuses
[11:18] <ikonia_> THJ exaclty
[11:18] <THJ> the worst thing I've had to do is compile new kernel modules.
[11:18] <ikonia_> gustavo your not learning much by getting panics
[11:19] <THJ> lol
[11:19] <magnetron> !kernel | gustavo
[11:19] <ubotu> gustavo: kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[11:19] <ikonia_> gustavo learn how to build a kernel and the ins and outs of what causes it to panic etc etc
[11:19] <Dell-Net> diff between server and desktop installations is that server has no x server and has more server appz installed then desktop
[11:19] <orbin> seamus7: i'd leave it as is.  is nm-applet running?
[11:19] <gustavo> lol, not really... but it happens while i was trying :)
[11:19] <frank95com> ciao
[11:19] <seamus7> orbin: sorry that's what i mean ... how do i get nm-applet to activate?
[11:19] <gustavo> thanks for the help :D
[11:19] <ikonia_> gustavo then don't say "I've done it many times" when someone advises you to learn
[11:19] <THJ> No problem
[11:20] <gustavo> but its the truth, never happened before... :)
[11:20] <ikonia_> gustavo so "learn"
[11:20] <vimalg2> does anyone know a hardware drivers channel? i have a nasty VIA Unichrome video chipset. Anyone share my pain? :p
[11:20] <kissingman> My  mplayer give me a message "fatal error"  how can i do?  Thanks....
[11:20] <gustavo> alright, thank you VERY MUCH
[11:20] <ikonia_> vimalg2 if you have a hardware issue, log it in launchpad
[11:20] <Analemma23> Here's a general question for you guys -- if I've installed one of the betas and have been using the update manager, does that mean my kernal is updated too?
[11:20] <Hairulfr> vimalg2: Isch, but you have gfx, right?
[11:21] <magnetron> !final | Analemma23
[11:21] <roland_> hey, i just downloaded right now a fresh copy of ubuntu 7.04 and burnt it on a new blank cd and inserted it to a pc on wich i wanted to install it.. my first experiences are that most programs crash, the desktop is extremely slow and unresponsive, and random applications crash including the installer
[11:21] <orbin> seamus7: make sure you have the notification area appplet on your panel, then try running nm-applet via alt+f2
[11:21] <ubotu> Analemma23: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[11:21] <THJ> How customized is the Ubuntu kernel? I imagine it's pretty bare-bone with all possible drivers compiled out as modules. Ubuntu being fond of GNU, I also would imagine it has no custom patches.
[11:21] <Hairulfr> Analemma23: Yes, it Final if you accepted the automatic updates
[11:21] <gargoyle80> what is currently the best direct connect client for ubuntu? :)
[11:21] <seamus7> orbin: ok thx
[11:21] <ikonia_> magnetron any ahcen you can use > instead of | with ubotu
[11:21] <ikonia_> chance that should read
[11:21] <slackern> Analemma23, if you got the 2.6.20-15 kernel then you got the latest (open a terminal and type 'uname -a' to see)
[11:21] <ikonia_> THJ pretty stock
[11:21] <THJ> Not that a patch goes against the principles of free software in any way, but it does seem to be the proprietary distributions that are fond of customizing the kernel.
[11:22] <vimalg2> ikonia: thanks i'm checking out launchpad now. its something i;ve never explored b4
[11:22] <roland_> hey, i just downloaded right now a fresh copy of ubuntu 7.04 and burnt it on a new blank cd and inserted it to a pc on wich i wanted to install it.. my first experiences are that most programs crash, the desktop is extremely slow and unresponsive, and random applications crash including the installer
[11:22] <ap1> How do I get Edgy kernel source? no package "linux-tree"?
[11:22] <THJ> gustavo, if you want to learn a lot about Linux, I strongly recommend playing around with Slackware.
[11:22] <Hairulfr> roland_: It's a livecd...
[11:22] <ikonia_> roland_ keep in mind your running from ram on a livecd
[11:22] <THJ> though even it has a package manager now, hehe
[11:23] <ikonia_> ap1 there is a source deb
[11:23] <THJ> maybe gentoo is the new slackware, hehe
[11:23] <roland_> Hairlufr: exactly, thats why using a livecd to test / install system is a hugely bad idea
[11:23] <gustavo> maybe in another time, im not good enough :)
[11:23] <vimalg2> Hairulfr: yeah. But VESA sucks. I'm interested in knowing if the Ubuntu team would integrate the OpenSource reverse-engineered drivers for VIA chipset(ref. www.unichrome.org) into their future releases
[11:23] <ap1> ikonia_: where is source deb?
[11:23] <roland_> anything can go wrong anytime
[11:23] <THJ> when i started out in 1997 it was slackware 3.0 :)
[11:23] <ikonia_> roland_ then use the alternate cd
[11:23] <ikonia_> ap1 in the ubuntu repo's
[11:23] <Hairulfr> roland_: Maybe you are system is shte. I've never had problems with livecds anywhere
[11:23] <ikonia_> THJ that conversation is better in -offtopic
[11:23] <Hairulfr> Tab compeltion...bah
[11:24] <ap1> ikonia_: I can't find the package name?
[11:24] <ikonia_> Hairulfr careful on the language
[11:24] <vimalg2> correction www.openchrome.org
[11:24] <THJ> ikonia: sorry, its so easy to forget, the channel name being #ubuntu, not #ubuntu-help. ^^
[11:24] <ap1> ikonia_: apt-cache search linux-kernel will not tell me...

[11:24] <Amec> F*
[11:24] <gustavo> why my kernel doesnt save my bzimage on /arch/x86_64/boot instead of /arch/i386/boot ?
[11:24] <ikonia_> ap1 use synaptic and browse
[11:24] <roland_> Hairulfr: my system runs edgy 6.10 fine (Except yesterday when suddenly out of nowhere all system started crashing and nothing worked anymore not even dpkg)
[11:25] <ikonia_> gustavo this is not kernel help
[11:25] <arooni> how can i get ubuntu to ACTUALLY REMOVE ALL FILES when i do sudo apt-get remove eclipse  (i want all bits of eclipse gone)
[11:25] <roland_> and fsck died
[11:25] <MaX_ManIc> yello
[11:25] <DVS01> roland_: sounds like a hardware problem
[11:25] <ap1> I tried Synaptic and apt-cache
[11:25] <THJ> dpkg --purge yourpackage, arooni
[11:25] <dungodung> gah! I insert the CD rom, but it won't upgrade from it. only from the internet... even after disabling the internet updates
[11:25] <gustavo> oh, u are very helpful :)
[11:25] <siimo> woot new ubuntu downloading now!!
[11:25] <gustavo> is there a chan for kernel help? :)
[11:25] <DVS01> roland_: try using memtest86 to see if you have any ram problems
[11:25] <ikonia_> gustavo #kernel
[11:25] <ikonia_> gustavo they are quite harsh though
[11:25] <siimo> gustavo: also try ##linux
[11:26] <Amec> when I try to install Feisty it gives me this error: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/multiverse/source/Sources.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
[11:26] <DVS01> roland_: also, try googling around for cpu stress testers. i also recommend keeping track of cpu and system temperature
[11:26] <roland_> DVS01: weird, only ubuntu does this, other OS runs fine
[11:26] <ikonia_> Amec its failed to fetch that package
[11:26] <Trist_an> are the packages which are dowloaded by synaptic, apt and so on are kept locally on hard drive or are they deleted after installation?
[11:26] <Amec> yes
[11:26] <magnetron> arooni: sudo apt-get autoremove
[11:26] <DVS01> roland_: if thats the case, then that's really weird
[11:26] <arooni> THJ:  is there another option?  eclipse still sthinkgs its there
[11:26] <Amec> but it keeps doing it
[11:26] <THJ> that's the thing about OSS volunteer help. "thou arth inferior, but I shalt helpeth thou.", okay, time to shut up. :)
[11:26] <ikonia_> Amec and thats doesn't look like a fresh install as its usinb multiverse
[11:26] <noiesmo> Trist_an, they are nornmally stored in /var/cace/apt/archives/
[11:26] <Hairulfr> dungodung: I thin you need the alternate to do that
[11:27] <noiesmo> cace cache
[11:27] <Amec> what..?
[11:27] <THJ> arooni: eclipse "thinks" its there?
[11:27] <dungodung> Hairulfr: alternate?
[11:27] <vimalg2> arooni: its probably just your userprefs stuff
[11:27] <ap1> ikonia_: linux-source it was
[11:27] <Hairulfr> dungodung: Check it before you download it. There is an alternate ISO available
[11:27] <Amec> I'm upgrading through Update Manager
[11:27] <ikonia_> Amec the repo name is selecting from multiverse, I'm not aware thatmultiverse is enabled at install time
[11:27] <arooni> ok this autoremove thing worked
[11:27] <dungodung> :(
[11:27] <THJ> arooni: if you removed eclipse using apt-get or dpkg you can probably safely delete the remaining eclipse-related files.
[11:27] <Trist_an> noiesmo, can I rm * what is archives?
[11:27] <ikonia_> Amec that package may not exist in the fesity repo
[11:27] <Trist_an> noiesmo, can I rm * what is IN archives?
[11:28] <dungodung> why would there be two different isos.. one for normal install, one for upgrades?
[11:28] <Amec> Then how do I install Feisty...?
[11:28] <Hairulfr> dungodung: I thin so yes
[11:28] <ikonia_> Amec check if that package exists, or try another mirror
[11:28] <ikonia_> Amec or use the cd
[11:28] <Trist_an> or is there a proper way to empty apt cache
[11:28] <arooni> whats best way to install eclipse?  sudo-apt get or........ dloading from website
[11:28] <ikonia_> Trist_an apt-get update
[11:29] <Amec> :(
[11:29] <noiesmo> Trist_an, yes you can just use sudo apt-get clean
[11:29] <ikonia_> arooni apt-get -
[11:29] <magnetron> Trist_an: sudo apt-get autoclean
[11:29] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : cant seem to find it
[11:29] <ikonia_> richard-blaine find what sorry
[11:29] <Trist_an> ok thanks because it eats 1.3G on my / partition so...
[11:29] <Lidis> I'm having a bit of a problem installing Ubuntu 7.04 on my laptop. I can't see my windows or linux partions in the installation program. It can access the partions then I mount /dev/hda2 and hda3 systems. But the installations says that the disk is unalocated.
[11:30] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : the md5sum for the dvd iso, this here only for cds : http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/MD5SUMS
[11:30] <arooni> is it better to download the next ubutnu now.... or to wait a bit?
[11:30] <Trist_an> I did sudo apt-get autoclean but my archives are still 1.1G instead of 1.3....
[11:30] <Hairulfr> arooni: The beta has been working flawlessly for weeks, it think it's safe to download the final now
[11:30] <Hairulfr> arooni: For me it has
[11:30] <magnetron> Trist_an: my mistake, it is sudo apt-get clean
[11:30] <mneptok> USE BITTORRENT!
[11:30] <Trist_an> okami, thanks magnetron
[11:31] <mrigns> bittorrent downloads are not working well in feisty, portforwarding in my router and iptables is set
[11:31] <ikonia_> richard-blaine thats strange its not in the md5 list
[11:31] <ikonia_> Hairulfr thats not true
[11:31] <mrigns> it connect to seeders but just dont start downloading well
[11:31] <ikonia_> Hairulfr there was a serious kernel error less than a week ago
[11:31] <berent> I have a ubuntu 6.1 LTS right now
[11:31] <Hairulfr> ikonia: For some, yeah, had no problems here.
[11:31] <berent> can i upgrade it to 7.04
[11:31] <mneptok> mrigns: what client?
[11:31] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : maybe because they serve only the torrent for the dvd, hence chances are torrent download will be 100% perfect
[11:31] <berent> via dist-upgrade
[11:31] <ikonia_> berent from 6.0.1 you'll have to do a clean update
[11:31] <magnetron> !upgrade >berent
[11:31] <Trist_an> berent, you have to upgrade to edgy and afterwards to feisty
[11:32] <ikonia_> richard-blaine possible but not how it sould be
[11:32] <gharz> exit
[11:32] <mrigns> mneptok: gnome-bittorrent, bittornado, azureus, no isp problem, they are working under etch
[11:32] <berent> I already have a edgy - edgy -> 6.10 right
[11:32] <spikeb> yes
[11:32] <spikeb> and you can go from 6.10->7.04
[11:32] <ikonia_> richard-blaine if you look in that dir - there is no dvd image
[11:33] <guillem101> Can I interrupt the ugrade process safely? The download speed has drastically gone down and I need to stop the process and continue it perhaps tomorrow...
[11:33] <ikonia_> richard-blaine thats why there is no dvd md5
[11:33] <ikonia_> guillem101 I doubt it
[11:33] <Trist_an> sorry berent the LST confused me, Edgy is not LTS
[11:33] <berent> spikeb : how ; should i change my sources.lst?
[11:33] <mneptok> mrigns: are you set to a statci IP for the forwarding? have yfou checked to ensure the IP you think you have is, in fact, correct?
[11:33] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : there's no md5sum in the dvd's torrent directory either
[11:33] <Amec> When I go to the Update Manager, a window pops up saying: "Not all updates can be installed" and it gives me two options. Distrobution Upgrade and cancel. When I click Distro Upgrade it goes to download and install Edgy (which I already have). Why is it doing this?
[11:33] <Trist_an> !update | berent
[11:33] <ubotu> berent: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[11:33] <hagabaka> weird
[11:33] <berent> Trist_an : Oh ok
[11:33] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : http://torrent.ubuntu.com/releases/feisty/release/dvd/
[11:33] <Lidis> I'm having a bit of a problem installing Ubuntu 7.04 on my laptop. I can't see my windows or linux partions in the installation program. It can access the partions then I mount /dev/hda2 and hda3 systems. But the installations says that the disk is unalocated.
[11:33] <hagabaka> fglrx is magically working for me again
[11:33] <ikonia_> richard-blaine thats a torret dir
[11:34] <hagabaka> the package didn't get updated just now did it?
[11:34] <noiesmo> guillem101, what stage is it at if its just downloading files then yes you can it will pick up from wr it left of when you start upgrade
[11:34] <arooni> how can i make ubuntu take a dump
[11:34] <mrigns> mneptok: i tried different ports and set them all on forwarding on my router and configured the iptables in feisty. it did all work in feisty beta though
[11:34] <ikonia_> arooni dump of what
[11:34] <Hairulfr> arooni: LOL
[11:34] <magnetron>  arooni: you mean a screenshot?
[11:34] <guillem101> hmm download speed is varying from time to time ... guess mirrors are a bit collapsed
[11:34] <arooni> its 2am and arooni is getting a little silly because of sleep deprivation
[11:34] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : that's right. There's no iso dir for dvd, hence no md5sum file. That's why I asked my first qn
[11:34] <ikonia_> arooni byeeeeeee
[11:35] <Hairulfr> arooni: Prt scr? Screenshot you mean?
[11:35] <arooni> sorry ikonia_
[11:35] <guillem101> noiesmo, exactly, it is at the downloading packages process
[11:35] <arooni> actually thats a good question
[11:35] <ikonia_> richard-blaine looks relastic explination
[11:35] <arooni> i want to make ubuntu stop making dumps of my screen
[11:35] <Amec> Does anyone know why when I go to the Update Manager, a window pops up saying: "Not all updates can be installed" and it gives me two options. Distrobution Upgrade and cancel. When I click Distro Upgrade it goes to download and install Edgy (which I already have).
[11:35] <mrigns> mneptok: azureus shows no problems. according to it everything works but it doesnt
[11:35] <arooni> i keep hitting prtscrn by accident
[11:35] <ryancr> i just enabled compiz and its nice and smooth...but the minimize, close buttons sometimes don't respond to a click, any ideas??
[11:35] <ikonia_> Hairulfr no, he was just being foolish
[11:35] <ryancr> this is on a intel 915
[11:35] <noiesmo> guillem101, then just stop it then when you run the command again it will pick up were it left off
[11:35] <Hairulfr> ikonia: Oh, I'm a humorless fool
[11:35] <aimtrainer> hi can anyone please help me to build truecrypt from source in feisty? From what I read it should not be a problem with the latest version but I just dont know how to do it
[11:35] <noiesmo> guillem101, :)
[11:35] <guillem101> noiesmo, , to stop it, I just force the close of the "Distribution upgrade" window?
[11:36] <ikonia_> Amec what are you upgrading from
[11:36] <Amec> Edgy
[11:36] <noiesmo> guillem101, should do it
[11:36] <berent> Trist_an : It shows my system is up to date
[11:36] <fabiim> where can i find the changelog for feisty ?
[11:36] <ikonia_> Amec it looks like all the packages you currently have installed are not upgradable/compatible with fesity
=== traveller2k is now known as traveller
[11:36] <Amec> How can I fix this...?
[11:36] <ikonia_> Amec so the dist upgrade is taking the distro to the latest version that is compatible (at a guess)
[11:36] <noiesmo> guillem101, apt-get might still run in the background just open terminal and check with ps ax command
[11:36] <richard-blaine> ikonia_ : well maybe i can just trust my torrent download. It's torrent!
[11:37] <ikonia_> Amec look at the packages that are not supported/compatible
[11:37] <Hairulfr> I don't know if easyubuntu works with feisty 100%, if it does, wouldn't it be an idea setting it as topic for all the new users? It "uncomplicates" thing a bit
[11:37] <guillem101> noiesmo, OK, thanks. SInce I have two machines doing the same (differerent arch and different ISP provider) I will use one to test the interruption ....
[11:37] <ikonia_> Hairulfr easyubuntu is not an ubuntu product and not supported
[11:37] <ikonia_> Hairulfr so has no business in here
[11:37] <guillem101> noiesmo, thanks for your help
[11:37] <Amec> It doesn't give me a list..
[11:37] <noiesmo> guillem101, it'll be right :)
[11:37] <ikonia_> Amec check the log
[11:37] <berent> spikeb : It shows my system is up to date and doesn't show Fiesty Fawn
[11:37] <Amec> Which is located where?
[11:37] <ikonia_> Amec /var/log
[11:37] <LaszloKv> Hi, would someone be able to help me with configuring a samba share of a directory?
[11:38] <Amec> kk
[11:38] <rohan> torrent.ubuntu.com is down ? my BT client cannot connect to it
=== wutzeknoll_ is now known as wutzeknoll
[11:38] <noiesmo> guillem101, if packages were being installed i would not want to stop it but there just downloading and apt-get keeps partial downloaded files for later
[11:38] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, yes
[11:38] <rohan> i am using the torrent downloaded from releases.ubuntu.com
[11:38] <bullgard4> What does it mean: 'to pull up a terminal' (Subject: irssi and screen)
[11:38] <foug> can someone explain what cached and shared memory is?
[11:39] <ikonia_> foug its shared memory from your system thats resident in cache
[11:39] <aimtrainer> LaszloKv, http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#Samba_Server
[11:39] <foug> ikonia_: so it's ok if all my memory is cached?
[11:39] <ikonia_> foug shared is used by multiple "things" caches is stuff thats referenced
[11:39] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, do you want the folder to have write permission for other user?
[11:39] <ikonia_> foug depends on whats caching it
[11:39] <Notchnick> can I get a link of a decent version for a gparted live cd.. to repartition drives
[11:40] <LaszloKv> No, I want it to be read only.
[11:40] <foug> ikonia_: that i don't know, so far beryl, exaile and gaim are running.
[11:40] <bullgard4> foug: 'cached memory' is a memory device which stores data temporarily. An example is a RAM between your main storage and your hard disk.
[11:40] <spikeb> berent, you can force it to check specifically for upgrades by typing sudo update-manager -c in a terminal window
[11:40] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, go to http://pastebin.ca/449603 and change what should be changed and afterwards put it in /etc/samba/smb.conf
[11:40] <ikonia_> foug its probably the kernel doing it which is fine
[11:40] <mneptok> oh dear God. some PCWorld writer is recommending Automatix.
[11:40] <orbin> bullgard4: it means open one up
[11:40] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, mainly change the path and writeable to no
[11:41] <ikonia_> mneptok please give me his name, so I can send an email
[11:41] <magnetron> !terminal > bullgard4
[11:41] <foug> ikonia_: k cool, the linux memory monitor is more technical than the one litestep had when i used windows
[11:41] <spikeb> mneptok, they would.
[11:41] <bullgard4> foug: 'shared memory' is a memory that is used by mofre than one application.
[11:41] <mneptok> ikonia_: letter bombs are illegal, dude.
[11:41] <ikonia_> mneptok I'm not going to bomb him
[11:41] <bullgard4> foug: more
[11:41] <berent> spikeb : thanks
[11:41] <mneptok> ikonia_: Automatix will take care of that, i guess.
[11:41] <spikeb> berent, you bet.
[11:41] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, also in smb.conf in the Authentication section you have to have security = share
[11:41] <foug> bullgard4: ahh cool, makes sense thanks :D was wondering cuz my memory monitor is completly coloured out. No free memory, most of it is cache though
[11:42] <ikonia_> mneptok where did you read this recommendation
[11:42] <LaszloKv> Trist_an I have it set up with guest ok and read only and such.
[11:42] <magnetron> !automatix > mneptok
[11:42] <arooni> help!
[11:42] <arooni> my eclipse doesnt work at all
[11:42] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, is it working?
[11:42] <arooni> org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Plug-in org.eclipse.ui.ide was unable toload class org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.IDEApplication.
[11:42] <LaszloKv> Trist_an and security =share
[11:42] <mneptok> ikonia_: http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130923-page,1-c,linux/article.html
[11:42] <Trist_an> I never had trouble with Automatix
[11:42] <berent> !fiesty
[11:42] <ubotu> FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[11:42] <ikonia_> mneptok thanks
[11:42] <LaszloKv> Trist_an No, that's how I started out.
[11:42] <bullgard4> orbin: What is the difference between 'to open a terminal' and 'to open a terminal up'?
[11:42] <mneptok> magnetron: why are you telling me about Automatix? :)
[11:43] <berent> spikeb : what are the major enhancements in fiesty?
[11:43] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, after modification did you restar samba?
[11:43] <magnetron> !automatix > magnetron
[11:43] <LaszloKv> Trist_an Yep.
[11:43] <spikeb> berent, updated packages, and the restricted drivers manager.
[11:43] <bitninja25> Hey guys, I have a question about the wireless networks manager...for some reason when I put in my key, which I know is right because I use it on live CDs and the like, the box keeps coming back. I guess Ubuntu has out-of-the-box support for the IPW3945 chipset because that's what I'm using in case it helps...
[11:43] <arooni> can someone help me installing eclipse
[11:43] <arooni> its dying for me
[11:43] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, and it doesn't work. Can you see your folder?
[11:43] <Decadent> I've problems on updating to feisty from edgy. When i start to update it gives an error saying: Your system does not contain ubuntu-desctop package and it was not possible to detect which version of ubuntu you are running. please install one of the packages above first using synaptik
[11:43] <bullgard4> magnetron: Your answer is insufficient. I do know what a terminal is.
[11:43] <Decadent> wha must i do??
[11:43] <berent> spikeb : how do i install just a server version?
[11:44] <mneptok> bullgard4: what are you trying to do?
[11:44] <spikeb> berent, you can download a server install cd image, if you wish.
[11:44] <tommy_> can someone help me?
[11:44] <berent> spikeb : cant i upgrade to it?
[11:44] <LaszloKv> Trist_an, When I go to my ip address I can see the folder I want shared, but when I click it, it says my permission might be denied.
[11:44] <magnetron> bullgard4: it means open a terminal
[11:44] <mneptok> HI JONO! WELCOME TO HAPPYLAND!
[11:44] <tommy_> im having that same tty error when trying to install 7.04
[11:44] <mneptok> *facepalm*
[11:44] <orbin> bullgard4: IMO it's the same thing
[11:44] <spikeb> berent, the upgrade process will just upgrade whatever you have installed.
[11:44] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, you don't have a ; before security = share right?
[11:45] <arooni> how can i find all files on my comp with eclipse in them
[11:45] <bullgard4> mneptok: I am trying to understand why screen could help me to use irssi better as Ubuntu documentation suggests.
[11:45] <richard-blaine>  ikonia_ : well, there's a md5sum.txt for every file inside the dvd iso, I guess that will do, considering.
[11:45] <arooni> i mean eclipse in titles
[11:45] <jono> mneptok: can I join the happy club?
[11:45] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, I can post my  smb.conf if you want
[11:45] <berent> spikeb: how long will it take to upgrade. i mean size
[11:45] <LaszloKv> Trist_an, Nope, no semi-colon.
[11:45] <bullgard4> magnetron: Thank you.
[11:45] <Jove`> arooni: find / -name *eclipse*
[11:45] <ryancr> hmmm it seems that the titlebar of the window is not even there, right clicking it gives me the menu as if i right clicked on my desktop
[11:45] <mneptok> jono: sure. get in line for your requisite lobotomy. :)
[11:45] <ryancr> silly compiz
[11:45] <ay_> Hi Is there any alternative dapper drake installation CD's?
[11:45] <ay_> (with newer kernels)
[11:45] <bullgard4> orbin: Ok. Thank you.
[11:45] <magnetron> arooni: don't delete the files manually, use synaptic to install /uninstall software
[11:46] <gustavo> is there any way to upgrade a 386 system to amd-64?
[11:46] <LaszloKv> Trist_an, Posting your smb.conf would probably help.
[11:46] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, http://pastebin.ca/449610
[11:46] <mneptok> bullgard4: if you don't know what a terminal is, irssi+screen will be more frustration than its worth, IMO.
[11:46] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, I have to go for lunch. pm if if it works or not
[11:46] <Tomcat_> ay_: No. Dapper only has old kernels, it's the whole point of new releases to get new software ;)
[11:46] <mneptok> bullgard4: use a GUI client until you get on your feet in Linux, and revisit this in a couple months.
[11:46] <bullgard4> mneptok: Who tells you that I do not know what a 'terminal' is? I do know what a terminal is.
[11:47] <Notchnick> can I get a link of a decent version for a gparted live cd.. to repartition drives
[11:47] <babo> this is the second time that my system upgrade has failed with errors such as ...
[11:47] <babo> Failed to fetch http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf/dists/edgy/Release.gpg Could not connect to packages.freecontrib.org:80 (88.191.33.6), connection timed out
[11:47] <tommy_> is there a solution to this:     /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off
[11:47] <LaszloKv> Trist_an, Thanks.
[11:47] <mneptok> bullgard4: 05:43 < bullgard4> magnetron: Your answer is insufficient. I do know what a terminal is.  <--- sorry, read too fast
[11:47] <coz_> who is resonsible for the feisty beryl default repo
[11:47] <ay_> Tomcat_: Eh. Yes. But not for LTS-releases.
[11:47] <bullgard4> mneptok: Your speech contradicts the Ubuntu rules.
[11:47] <mneptok> bullgard4: what are you stuck on?
[11:47] <ay_> Tomcat_: Servers that is.
[11:47] <foug> is there a command to refresh my memory? so it's not all cached
[11:47] <matt__> so anything that is worth checking out that feisty can do that edgy couldn't do?
[11:47] <mneptok> bullgard4: excuse me?
[11:47] <dgold> babo: those are non-canonical repos
[11:47] <ay_> Debian usually has loads of alternative bootdisks.
[11:47] <berent> spikeb: how long will it take to upgrade. i mean size
[11:48] <ay_> After it's up and running. Kernel isn't a problem.
[11:48] <magnetron> Notchnick: if you have the Ubuntu desktop cd, you can use that. it has gparted on it already
[11:48] <Tomcat_> ay_: Why shouldn't it be? Old releases are frozen, new releases get new kernels.
[11:48] <spikeb> berent, hmm, no idea actually i havent upgraded
[11:48] <protocol1> hey I got those ATI drivers installed
[11:48] <ay_> Tomcat_: So what do you suggest I run on a productions server (Say 20 of them)
[11:48] <magnetron> protocol1: nice
[11:48] <babo> dgold: why is it going to non-canonical repos ? Should I comment them out of my repo selection ?
[11:48] <protocol1> yeah they awesome
[11:49] <berent> mneptok : how long will it take to upgrade from 6.1 to 7.04. i mean size
[11:49] <babo> what's that file called again ?
[11:49] <MagnusR> Hi! Is it an easy way to see what packages are new in the repository for feisty compared to edgy?
[11:49] <dgold> bullgard4: the irssi+screen combo is good if you leave your irssi session running on a emote computer, which means you can come back to it later without losing connectivity
[11:49] <pukkie> orbin: thanks, but now i still don't know nothing about the repositories and such :) are they the same?
[11:49] <tommy_> someone
[11:49] <Tomcat_> ay_: Either dapper (with your own kernel, if you absolutely need it), or edgy (which is quite stable now).
[11:49] <mneptok> berent: depends on how you do it.
[11:49] <ay_> I can't upgrade dist on servers every 18 months. When you got hundreds of them. That's what LTS is for.
[11:49] <tommy_> how do i fix this :            /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off
[11:49] <protocol1> hopefully I dont lockup in Counter Stike now
[11:49] <dgold> babo: check the comments file - see *why* the freecontrib.org/plf stanza is in your sources.list
[11:50] <berent> mneptok : i am doing it via update-manager
[11:50] <guillem101> noiesmo, The process seems to be as follows: 1 kill process called "feisty" 2 goto /etc/apt and copy sources.list.distUpgrade to sources.list
[11:50] <Tomcat_> ay_: Yes, but if the kernel doesn't support your hardware, it's usually too new. You can't run MS-DOS 5.0 on current systems either ;)
[11:50] <ay_> Tomcat_: I can't run edgy, because that is out of support in a short while. dapper with own kernel is nice. But how.
[11:50] <mneptok> berent: good luck. the mirrors are hammered.
[11:50] <Angel-SL> hi, where do i find the MD5SUMs?
[11:50] <orbin> pukkie: my guess is yes, but perhaps you should ask in the relevant channel?  i don't run one.
[11:50] <bullgard4> dgold: But if I do not  use a remote computer, screen will give no value added, right?
[11:50] <guillem101> noiesmo, I'm reboooting to see if I can continue from where I was...
[11:50] <mneptok> berent: that will take quite a bit of time
[11:50] <Stig> Hi. How to I check to make sure my nvidia graphics drivers are installed correctly?
[11:50] <Tomcat_> ay_: There are guides for getting your own kernel in dapper...
[11:50] <adultswim> I read online that you're supposed to go to System > Preferences > Session > Session Options to disable the gnome splash screen, but the option isnt there... did it get moved to a adifferent place for fiesty?
[11:50] <ay_> Tomcat_: Yes of course. But you need to get the installer running first.
[11:50] <berent> mneptok : any idea about size approx .
[11:51] <ay_> Can't install if the installer does not see the raid or the networkcard.
[11:51] <Angel-SL> hi, where do i find the MD5SUMs?
[11:51] <tommy_> how do i fix this:               "/bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off"
[11:51] <Tomcat_> ay_: I guess I don't have a good solution then. :\
[11:51] <mneptok> berent: no idea. depends on the individual.
[11:51] <ay_> This goes for _all_ new Dell's and IBM servers.
[11:51] <dgold> bullgard4: I use screen on non-networked computers - I like to be able to create new windows, run processed and come back to them without worrying about closing the gnome-terminal window. YMMV
[11:51] <lzap> hello, how to upgrade from a mirror? I mean, I wonder to click on update in update-manager, its so slow and I wonder if it will use the main archive (which is currently under high load)
[11:51] <babo> dgold: I dunno. It just says Penguin Liberation Front. I guess I shoudl comment out that and quite a few of the other repos too ? They are probably getting /. with the upgrade ...
[11:51] <Tomcat_> ay_: You can try Debian, that might work.
[11:51] <alleyoopster> Angel-SL: you can find them on the cd
[11:51] <berent> mneptok : individual. what do u mean?
[11:51] <tommy_> is anyone having the same problem as me?                    "/bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off"
[11:51] <Angel-SL> alleyoopster: ...
[11:51] <magnetron> !md5 | Angel-SL
[11:51] <ay_> Tomcat_: Yes. That's whats we've been running for the last 10 years.
[11:52] <Tomcat_> ay_: As I said, you can't expect old software to run on new servers, and Ubuntu only gets an LTS release every couple of years... :\
[11:52] <Angel-SL> !md5
[11:52] <babo> do I have to reload anything after updating sources.list ?
[11:52] <orbin> Stig: run glxinfo and you should hopefully see stuff about nvidia and direct rendering should say yes.
[11:52] <mneptok> berent: if you have hundreds of extra packages installed that i don't, your upgrade takes longer.
[11:52] <BlackAnthrax> so any new software for feisty worth checking out?
[11:52] <ay_> Tomcat_: That's why you release newer install-media.
[11:52] <Stig> Is System > Administration > Restricted drivers manager the correct way to install GFX drivers on Feisty for my nvidia graphics card?
[11:52] <ubotu> Angel-SL: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/VerifyIsoHowto or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[11:52] <bullgard4> dgold: Understood. Thank you very much.
[11:52] <mrigns> aaaah this torrent issue annoys me :( the logs won't show any probs
[11:52] <mneptok> Stig: yes
[11:52] <mrigns> it's just not working, im clueless
[11:52] <ay_> Or someone has a repository of alternative install-media.
[11:52] <ay_> But I havn't found one yet.
[11:52] <orbin> babo: yes, click reload in synaptic or run sudo apti-get update
[11:53] <tommy_> whats this:    /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off, help me!
[11:53] <orbin> *apt-get
[11:53] <bef_> My name is jimmy mcpeach and I want an ubuntu on my repositorital portail?
[11:53] <Stig> Thanks. By the way, I think Feisty is absolutely awsome. I was new to Edgy and found it hell trying to install my network, wireless card drivers, etc. Feisty done it all for me when I first booted it up! :P
[11:53] <ay_> Tomcat_: Or a way to load newer drivers during install from a cd or floppy.
[11:53] <adultswim> how do i disable the gnome splash screen in feisty?
[11:53] <alleyoopster> Angel-SL: if you have the cd , there is a file there md5, but I see the bot got off his arse :)
[11:53] <berent> mneptok : ok lets say i press upgrade button in update-manager . will it show me size and ask me if i want to proceed or directly start off upgrading
[11:53] <tommy_> whats this: /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off, help me!
[11:53] <dgold> babo: those sound like 3rd aprty repos which were added for specific tasks. comment them in, then run synaptic. In synpatic, click on the 'status' button, and select the 'Installed (local or obsolete)' - this will give you an idea of what was installed "ex-cathedra"
[11:53] <mneptok> adultswim: System -> Admin -> Login Window
[11:53] <Angel-SL> i need the sum for 7.04, as i suspect my ISO is corrupted!@
[11:53] <tommy_> whats this: /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off, help me!
[11:54] <guillem101> noiesmo, Yess! it works
[11:54] <Angel-SL> and i can't burn.
[11:54] <mneptok> berent: have you started this process?
[11:54] <tommy_> whats this: /bin/sh: can't access tty: Job control turned off, help me!
[11:54] <magnetron> !md5 > Angel-SL
[11:54] <mneptok> tommy_: please do not repeat
[11:54] <bitninja25> Hey guys can anyone help me with a wireless config problem?
[11:54] <berent> mneptok : nope. thats why i am asking
[11:54] <tommy_> sorry, im frustrated
[11:54] <adultswim> mneptok: no it isnt... thats just login settings... (if i'm wrong, which tab is it under cuz i didnt see it)
[11:55] <os2mac> can anyone recommend a keyserver?
[11:55] <ikonia_> keyserver ?
[11:55] <Angel-SL> magnetron: I don't have the sum to compare with!!
[11:55] <os2mac> gpg keyserver for email signatures
[11:55] <babo> is it safe to surf the net while upgrading ?
[11:55] <mneptok> berent: use a torrent to get the alternate CD. torrent downloads are really healthy right now. then, update your sources.list swapping "feisty" for "edgy" and ensure the Feisty CD is an available repo.
[11:55] <Stig> OK. It looks like the nvidia drivers are installed. Now I would like a good desktop themes, etc. On Edgy I tried Beryl and had nothing but problems with it, it seemed to make my Ubuntu very slow, even though I have a very good hardware. What is Compiz like? Is it more stable than Beryl? Do I need to use both, or do they basically do the same thing?
[11:56] <fran> hola alguien de espaa
[11:56] <mneptok> berent: it's like getting repo updates at BitTorrent speeds ;)
[11:56] <magnetron> Angel-SL: so download the sum to compare with
[11:56] <noiesmo> guillem101, :)
[11:56] <fran> hola alguien de espaa
[11:56] <Angel-SL> magnetron: WHERE?!
[11:56] <magnetron> !es > fran
[11:56] <adultswim> stig, im using beryl on a low end computer, and it looks really good... no performance problems.
[11:56] <magnetron> !md5 > Angel-SL
[11:56] <TheoMurpse> i just upgraded to Feisty, and when I select it in GRUB, it loads up a bit, then black screens and freezes. What can I do to diagnose th problem?
[11:57] <Angel-SL> magnetron: NEITHER of these two links provide them!!!!
[11:57] <lieter> Hi guys, how can i set VLC as default media player?
[11:57] <fran> hello
[11:57] <Stig> Whenever I tried to minimize windows, scroll down pages, close windows, etc. It was VERY slow... When I changed the windows manager to default, it was much better
[11:57] <fran> spain
[11:57] <Stig> I might give it a try, if it messes up again, can I uninstall it OK?

[11:57] <broyles> Hi all, i am trying to install 7.04 desktop on my laptop and when it reboots all i am getting is Hard disk boot sector invalid, i have tried to install grub manually but 0 joy any help?
[11:58] <orbin> lieter: video files? dvds?  both?
=== yharrow_mobile is now known as yharrow
[11:58] <lieter> orbin, both
[11:58] <magnetron> Ange-SL: the md5s are to find at the sameplace as the isos
[11:58] <lieter> i dislike mplayer for some reason (i used vlc on windows before ;))
[11:59] <Stig> So is it best to use Beryl and Compiz together? Is it easier to install on Feisty than it was on Edgy?
[11:59] <orbin> lieter: well my method:  for files, in nautilus, right-click on the video file > properties > open with tab.
[12:00] <SubMOA> ok... got a good question for you programmers... I am looking for a way to "auto-hide" my panel when I mouse over a certain area.  I have Beryl and  I can activate sides/corners, etc. to run scripts (I think).  Anyway, it is on the LEFT SIDE (running up and down) and I want the autohide to move the panel UP and DOWN (not left and right like the generic autohide does)  Any help?
[12:00] <orbin> lieter: for DVDs, sys > prefs > removable > multimedia tab
[12:00] <mc44> Stig: you cant use both at the same time
[12:00] <magnetron> Stig: use one at a time. Compiz is bundled with feisty and easy to enable
[12:00] <Stig> oh ok
[12:00] <Stig> I might as well try Compiz firsy
[12:00] <Stig> tfirst*
[12:00] <Stig> first* :O
[12:00] <pleb2> hey ppl i need help
[12:00] <Stig> How do I enable Compiz then?
[12:01] <matason> What's the name of the restricted madwidi package that Ubuntu 6.06 uses?
[12:01] <SubMOA> the new (unsupported) beryl plugin for grouping is awesome... it's like the windows on the Sun Java OS (forgot the name) where you can have windows on the back of windows.
[12:01] <LjL> !helpme
[12:01] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[12:01] <pleb2> im trying to install java into firefox in ubuntu and whenever i try it, using the step by step on the java site.... it crashes firefox and i have to remove it again... is there not a package for this like the sun-java5-plugin in debian????

[12:01] <broyles> Hi all, i am trying to install 7.04 desktop on my laptop and when it reboots all i am getting is Hard disk boot sector invalid, i have tried to install grub manually via a chroot but still no joy
[12:02] <SubMOA> predaeus, Ahhaa... thank you... I didn't even think of that.  Much appreciated.
[12:02] <SubMOA> Hairulfr, its in the repos under "unsupported" or something to that effect.  I think there was a video of it, let me check
[12:03] <jojo2024> someone knows why the hell the feisty/sympa-5.2.3 package creates an empty database ???

[12:09] <QwertyM> Um, no splash, just boot screen and then a blank black LjL

[12:10] <LjL> QwertyM: ah, in recovery mode there's probably just the Alt+F1 terminal

[12:11] <brahmin63> is there any way to encrypt whole filesystem and then access it from windows with samba?

[12:16] <dsdg> Err http://security.ubuntu.com dapper-security/main libssl0.9.8 0.9.8a-7ubuntu0.3
[12:16] <IndyGunFreak> I'll be glad when everyone has 7.04, and the servers speed up..lol
[12:16] <Slart> brahmin63: i'm not sure if truecrypt can do this.. but perhaps..
[12:16] <dsdg> Connection failed
[12:16] <dsdg> any advice?
[12:16] <Slart> brahmin63: at least it can encrypt your filessystem
[12:16] <TheoMurpse> mc44: I can't even ctrl+alt+f1 to get to a terminal

[12:16] <derventer> hi can anyone help me with a pcmcia+kismet?
[12:17] <TheoMurpse> mc44: yes, on normal; if i do recovery mode, and then startx, it seems to work dandy.
[12:17] <dsdg> barktpolar, i have never used it, is it difficult? maybe i should just get the deb file?
[12:17] <kleftisx> hello last night i was upgrade to feisty via terminal...and the power gets of as downloading the packages...so the computer shuts down. is there any way to resume downloads of feisty upgrades?
[12:17] <glick> looks like dell will be offering preinstalled ubuntu soon
[12:17] <IndyGunFreak> dsdg, i've got ti installed no prob, i had a torrent going at 600k... its been downloading programs via the package manager thats been slow.
[12:17] <pleb2> im trying to install java into firefox in ubuntu and whenever i try it, using the step by step on the java site.... it crashes firefox and i have to remove it again... is there not a package for this like the sun-java5-plugin in debian????
[12:17] <ay_> Is there a way to bootstrap the dapper installer with a edgy og feisty-installer? Or even a debian installer?
[12:17] <M_Fatih> i pressed CTRL+C when upgrading, and some packages broked. i'm trying to apt-get -f install or dpkg-reconfigure package but not works. "openoffice.org-style-default" package , can't remove/purge, reinstall reconfigure .. how must i do?
[12:17] <mc44> TheoMurpse: does it go black after the boot up with the orange bar, or before?
[12:17] <TheoMurpse> mc44: right now in normal mode it has done that loading-bar thing with the ubuntu logo
[12:17] <TheoMurpse> mc44: after the orange bar it goes black
[12:17] <barktpolar> dsdg: What are you using now?
[12:17] <magnetron> !java
[12:17] <ubotu> To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
[12:17] <mneptok> pleb2: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
[12:17] <mc44> TheoMurpse: try ctrl-alt-bkspace?
[12:17] <CookedGryphon> kleftisx: it should do that automatically ifyou carry on the apt-get upgrade
[12:18] <alleyoopster> glick: where did you see this?
[12:18] <pleb2> mneptok thank youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[12:18] <TheoMurpse> mc44: and it's the kind of black where the OS is sending "all black" to it, as opposed to the monitor not getting power...

[12:18] <dsdg> barktpolar, in the console, i only have ssh to the box,
[12:18] <M_Fatih> -- i pressed CTRL+C when upgrading, and some packages broked. i'm trying to apt-get -f install or dpkg-reconfigure package but not works. "openoffice.org-style-default" package , i can't remove/purge, reinstall reconfigure.. what must i do?
[12:18] <mc44> TheoMurpse: so when you run startx in recovery mode does it go to the login screen or straight into gnome?
[12:19] <TheoMurpse> mc44 straight into gnome
[12:19] <barktpolar> What system I meant (Ubuntu, Windows)
[12:19] <mc44> TheoMurpse: sounds like a problem with gdm
[12:19] <dsdg> barktpolar, ubuntu dapper,
[12:19] <IndyGunFreak> glick, where did you hear that?(about Michael Dell?)
[12:19] <TheoMurpse> mc44: so i just let normal mode sit a while, and it's finally (after 5 minutes or so) brought up the login screen
[12:19] <barktpolar> then try the .torrent idea and see
[12:19] <CookedGryphon> kleftisx: yeah that too, it downloads all the packages individually to /var/cache/apt/ then installs them when its done
[12:20] <sand_storm> can anyone help me

[12:24] <itguru> without my website showing up
[12:24] <alleyoopster> glick: ??
[12:24] <CookedGryphon> kleftisx: to prove it to yourself you could see how many packages it says need downloading, let it download a couple of small ones, then cancel it and run it again and you will see that it looks like its starting again but its actually not bothering re-downloading the packages you already got
[12:24] <lieter> no, not that bug :)
[12:24] <kleftisx> CookedGryphon : yes it have download all packages men thx
[12:24] <kleftisx> CookedGryphon : how to install them now all those packages? one by one?
[12:24] <CookedGryphon> Linuturk: have you looked at the terminal window? it might be asking you a question
[12:24] <lieter> slackern, i can still see contents in black&white
[12:24] <CookedGryphon> kleftisx: nope, just do exactly what you did before, it will still install the already downloaded packages, just not bother downloading them again
[12:24] <Ubuntulator> I'm after some advice on what the best java packages are for the feisty system and firefox ?
[12:24] <dimebar> lieter: is the window 'negative' in colour?

[12:24] <ikonia_> sand_storm whats this ??? http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/MD5SUMS you didn't look very far
[12:24] <Linuturk> CookedGryphon, the terminal window is open. In fact, I can't shrink it or anything, It is just hung up. no drive access or anything
[12:24] <Slart> lieter: beryl fades windows that are not responding.. it's a feature =)
[12:25] <lieter> Slart, i know, but why is opera not responding :P

[12:32] <Stig> Hi, how do I make firestarter firewall startup automatically when I start Ubuntu? Or is firestarter always working in the background?
[12:32] <aimtrainer> hey! is it normal that there is no output for quite a time after this: http://pastebin.ca/449640 ?
=== NewbieBaba is now known as Darius
[12:32] <ubuntu_noob> rambo, I've installed libstdc but it doesn't seem to fix  error: C++ preprocessor "/lib/cpp"
[12:33] <aimtrainer> it says it may take a long time but it doesnt say it s along time without any< output - just wanna make sure
[12:33] <foug> how can i install opera using only the terminal? my firefox has broke
[12:33] <ubuntu_noob> rambo, anyother options ?
[12:33] <thwapme> ran apt-get install kubuntu-desktop last night before going to bed. ran great but it looks like the last 50 files or so failed. it suggested "maybe run apt-get update or --fix-missing?" so i'm wondering which one would work. update or --fix-missing?
[12:33] <Slart> Stig: I'm not sure firestarter is running the firewall.. doesn't firestarter just configure iptables.. and iptables is running all the time
[12:33] <rambo3> ubuntu_noob, what are you trying to do ? compile what ?
[12:33] <hoelk> that update is 1+gb?
[12:33] <hoelk> 8|
[12:33] <Stig> I'm not sure :O So it's not actually a firewall?!
[12:33] <magnetron> foug: if you only want to use the terminal, install elinks
[12:33] <ubuntu_noob> rambo, the wesnoth game :p
[12:34] <Madpilot> foug, assuming you've still got the rest of the desktop, install Epiphany or another browser, then grab Opera. Or use wget
[12:34] <Slart> !firestarter
[12:34] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[12:34] <vega-> Stig: all "firewalls" in linux are just frontends to iptables
[12:34] <pleb2> can i ask is there a installer package for flash... like the sun-java6-plugin. is there a flash player 9 one????
[12:34] <alleyoopster> foug: why only terminal, have you know desktop?
[12:34] <Stig> Ohh ok
[12:34] <ubd> what should i write in fstab to mount ext3?
[12:34] <Slart> Stig: yup.. firestarter is just a flashy front end for iptables =)

[12:40] <TheoMurpse> isn't there supposed to be some new kind of network manager in feisty? because i'm not seeing it...
[12:40] <Slart> ubd: and mounting ext3 is just like mounting ext2... just switch ext2 for ext3 in the line in fstab
[12:40] <NearTotalN00b> I have some problems having upgraded to 7.04.  Is this the place for me to ask about them?
[12:40] <magnetron> TheoMurpse: upper right corner of screen, notification area
[12:41] <gnomefreak> TheoMurpse: for ubuntu kubuntu or xubuntu or edubuntu?
[12:41] <magnetron> NearTotalN00b: go on, ask
[12:41] <ubd> slart   /dev/hda6       /home/160g           ext3    defaults        0       ?

[12:41] <pleb2> can i ask is there a installer package for flash... like the sun-java6-plugin. is there a flash player 9 one????
[12:42] <ubd> what should be the last number?
[12:42] <NearTotalN00b> I have (had?) Xubuntu 6.10.  I upgraded to 7.04 yesterday, but X crashes.

[12:42] <MarkCh> hi, how do i change my default preferred shell yakuake uses?
[12:42] <Laizerox> what is ther desktop version?
[12:42] <pleb2> rambo3 ta
[12:42] <TheoMurpse> gnomefreak magnetron: ubuntu...in my UR corner I have "manual network config" sound a clock and logoff
[12:42] <gnomefreak> NearTotalN00b: let me guess nvidia card?
[12:42] <Laizerox> !helpme
[12:42] <ubotu> Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[12:42] <tarelerulz_> is ssh turn on by default on Kubuntu or Ubuntu ?
[12:42] <NearTotalN00b> I've installed Gnome as a temporary alternative.
[12:42] <Slart> ubd: looks right.. that last ?... check man fstab for what it means.. something about autochecking.. but I'm not sure
[12:43] <gnomefreak> TheoMurpse: you dont see 2 computers looking icon?
[12:43] <Laizerox> ...
[12:43] <NearTotalN00b> gnomefreak, no, a SiS 6326 (or something like that).
[12:43] <Syke> ... fond a hint: -fno-stack-protector, from http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=303541, I'll long-shoot with this one.
[12:43] <Laizerox> What is the DESKTOP version
[12:43] <magnetron> TheoMurpse: that network thing is the network manager
[12:43] <TheoMurpse> gnomefreak: I see in the "tray" two computers labeled "manual network configuration"
[12:43] <gnomefreak> NearTotalN00b: apt-cache policy network-manager (what version is installed
[12:43] <Slart> Laizerox: eh.. it's the normal version..the "not server" version
[12:43] <linoleum> well I still can't use my 8800 gtx nividia
[12:43] <linoleum> even with the nvidia-glx-new ...
[12:44] <Laizerox> Ty :)
[12:44] <TheoMurpse> gnomefreak: all I can do is select "enable networking" or deselect it...there are no properties to modify, no wireless routers to connect to, etc.
[12:44] <magnetron> Laizerox: "Desktop" is the most common version of Ubuntu, with all the software for everyday use
[12:44] <tarelerulz_> Do any one know why I get ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.101 port 22: Connection refused
[12:44] <Bhaskar1> I have Ubuntu 6.06LTs now i have to migrate Kbuntu, i have CD of kbuntu 6.10 now i want to upgrade 6.06 ubuntu without loss of existing data , how can i ?
[12:44] <KnickLighter> tarelerulz_; sudo apt-get install ssh
[12:44] <gnomefreak> TheoMurpse: right
[12:44] <Slart> linoleum: I thought the newest driver version supported 8800 gtx.. was I wrong? have you tried installing the driver from the nvidia site?
[12:44] <gnomefreak> TheoMurpse: thats normal
[12:44] <tokyo25> where can i find all the programs i have on my computer? and where can i find my downloads. from firefox
[12:45] <tarelerulz_> I  have ssh in the prosess list
[12:45] <tarelerulz_> It says it is sleeping ?
[12:45] <Slart> tokyo25: I think firefox downloads end up in /home/username
[12:45] <Madpilot> tokyo25, downloads from Firefox should go right to the Desktop
[12:45] <slackern> tarelerulz_: you have sshd running too?

[12:45] <[Nige] > anyone know how to get vista and samba talking? This is driving me nuts! Vista cant seem my samba shares
[12:45] <TheoMurpse> gnomefreak So how do I get wireless to work? How do I tell it what wireless network to join? I thought there was supposed to be something new in this to let me select networks.
[12:46] <tokyo25> ok. i thoght they were just shortcuts
[12:46] <tokyo25> thnks
[12:46] <tarelerulz_> I think I have ssh running It has it gnome system monitor .
[12:46] <linoleum> Slart: yes the nvidia-glx-new is supposed to works for the 8800 gtx ... but I changed from vesa to nvidia, still nothing
[12:46] <Slart> tokyo25: programs are a bit trickier.. they are kind of everywhere... /bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin /opt and probably 50 more places
[12:46] <gnomefreak> TheoMurpse: in the system menu you should see networking
[12:46] <kalila> what is wrong with edgy eft repositories?
[12:46] <gnomefreak> maybe in admin
[12:46] <kalila> they are timing out for me
[12:46] <slackern> tarelerulz_: 'sudo /etc/init.d/sshd start' otherwise to start it.
[12:46] <linoleum> Slart: I dont really want to install from the binaries from the nvidia website...
[12:46] <magnetron> !slow > kalila
[12:46] <LjL> they're probably still suffering from the release load, kalila
[12:46] <syock> I installed Feisty since its beta days. Does update make it the same as it the same as the current released version?
[12:46] <MarkCh> what's the file in my home dir that sets what my preferred shell is?
[12:46] <magnetron> !final > syock
[12:47] <Slart> linoleum: what's the error message from the x startup? /var/log/xorg.log or something like that
[12:47] <defrysk> syock, yes
[12:47] <TheoMurpse> gnomefreak: the only thing I see is what has been there since at least 6.06 when I first tried Ubuntu. My wireless connection is there. I go to it and type in the ssid for a known network nearby which is open, and it doesn't connect.
[12:47] <parking-> how to make my HD to read/write so i can copy all files?
[12:47] <linoleum> Slart: it tries to load the wfb module, but then say it doesn't exist.
[12:47] <slackern> parking-: you want to enabled write support for NTFS?
[12:47] <syock> I wonder if the bot's running
[12:47] <syock> !final
[12:47] <ubotu> If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[12:47] <gnomefreak> TheoMurpse: than im not sure my wireless card is usable out of box
[12:47] <parking-> slackern: its ext3 too
[12:47] <parking-> :)
[12:47] <Slart> linoleum: wfb? what's that?
[12:48] <magnetron> MarkCh: use menu System>Administration>Users to change preferred shell
[12:48] <linoleum> Slart: I have no idea :)
[12:48] <sldkfj> Does anyone know what channel to enter to find out  how I would tweak the width of Usplash ?
[12:48] <TheoMurpse> gnomefreak: My wireless has been usable on the past 3 liveCDs, but when I actually install to the HDD it never works, and no one has ever been able to help me figure out why, despite the fact that my wireless card has an OSS driver, so it's not a proprietary problem. The exact same source code works excellent with other distros.
[12:48] <slackern> parking-: i would say that use chown to change the owner of the folders where you need write/read access
[12:49] <peter77> When I wobble the windows I can see the frame refresh flicker, but on my dads machine it's perfect
[12:49] <peter77> my laptop has an intel chipset and my dads pc has an nvidia chipset
[12:49] <Slart> sldkfj: I think this would be the right one.. keep asking.. you'll get lucky sooner or later
[12:49] <foug> how do i change it so when you're op'd in xchat your icon isn't a sheriff badge?
[12:50] <magnetron> peter77: that nvidia card is faster
[12:50] <Slart> linoleum: can  you paste your xorg.conf in pastebin?
[12:50] <sldkfj> Slart, ok, thanks
[12:50] <parking-> slackern: how..... didn't try that yet
[12:50] <PirateHead> How do you remove a symlink without deleting the file that it links to?
[12:50] <slackern> parking-: and for ntfs read/write support you need 'ntfs-3g' package and 'ntfs-config' to have a little gui
[12:50] <linoleum> Slart: ok I have found a solution
[12:51] <gnomefreak> foug: if not in settings than you would have to figure out what part of the debian dir. when building to configure it during build (unless someone knows of a hack or a script)
[12:51] <linoleum> Slart: it's a bug with the package. the module wtf is missing, so I have to take it from the run, then copy it where it should be installed by the nvigida-glx-new package
[12:51] <Erebus> Um, stupid question - i downloaded the ISO from the link on ubuntu.com, which is a Live CD - I thought it also doubled as an installer, is this not the case?
[12:51] <Slart> linoleum: mm, found some pages about it.. you're not the only one with that problem.. =)
[12:51] <foug> gnomefreak: rgr
[12:51] <Slart> Erebus: it's supposed to be both... installer and live cd
[12:51] <linoleum> Slart: and this problem is only for 8800
[12:51] <gnomefreak> rgr?
[12:51] <slackern> parking-: to use chown on a folder  you could for example use 'chown -R parking /myfolder' to make parking the owner of the files/folders -R is recursive
[12:51] <foug> gnomefreak: roger
[12:51] <magnetron> Erebus: it IS an installer, click "Install" icon on desktop when running it
[12:51] <valdi> anyone willing to help me with this: "x server no screen" error when trying to install Feisty with ati radeon x1400.. what to do?
[12:52] <Erebus> Thanks!
[12:52] <Slart> linoleum: yes.. serves you right for buying top of the line graphics cards just to make us all green with envy ;)
[12:52] <jokoon> Hello :) I'd like to replace occurrences of text in a m3u file, for example i:\music\ with /dev/hdb2/music ... what command to use and can I create a script ? like a .BAT but for linux, is it a bash file ?
[12:52] <slackern> parking-:  chown -R parking:parking will set user:group to it also
[12:52] <soho> valdi; http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?s=b7232d6d7dae3620c90ae3dce78c4c63&goto=newpost&t=414841
[12:52] <linoleum> Slart: hehe , even the drivers on windows are not yet stable :p
[12:52] <slackern> parking-: i would recommend you do a 'man chown' and read a little about it first though
[12:52] <gnomefreak> foug: ty
[12:53] <PirateHead> jokoon: use a sh "shell script" file
[12:53] <jokoon> thanks
[12:53] <PirateHead> jokoon: start the script with the line '#/bin/sh', without the single quotes, and then put the exact commands that you want to run after that. Works just like a BAT, pretty much.
[12:54] <DVS01> how do i disable native command queuing for my hard drive?
[12:54] <peter77> I've noticed that I get what looks like a frame refresh ficker while wobbling windows, does anyone else experience this?
[12:54] <PirateHead> How can I remove a symlink without deleting the file that it links to?
[12:54] <jokoon> thanks a lot PirateHead :)
[12:54] <kbrooks> <DVS01> how do i disable native command queuing for my hard drive? # what does that mean?
[12:54] <kbrooks> <PirateHead> How can I remove a symlink without deleting the file that it links to? # do it
[12:54] <PirateHead> kbrooks: if I use rm, it will delete the file, won't it?
[12:54] <kbrooks> PirateHead, no.
[12:55] <mneptok> brap
[12:55] <kbrooks> PirateHead, a symlink is a file.
[12:55] <Tipolosko> PirateHead: simply remove with rm or whatever you want: your real file will not be touched
[12:55] <slackern> It will just delete the symlink, not the destination
[12:55] <aldin> rambo3, i sent u private message do u see it?
[12:55] <DVS01> kbrooks: its a setting involved with hard drive i/o
[12:55] <kbrooks> PirateHead, with the actual file path in it
[12:55] <peter77> I've noticed that I get what looks like a frame refresh ficker while wobbling windows, does anyone else experience this?
[12:55] <kbrooks> DVS01, oh.
[12:55] <slackern> if you are unsecure just make a backup of the file otherwise before trying
[12:55] <DVS01> ah.. someone informed me
[12:55] <DVS01> must write 1 to file /sys/block/sdX/device/queue_depth
[12:55] <DVS01> depending on device name
[12:56] <PirateHead> nautilus gives me the error "Not on the same filesystem" when I try to delete my symlink. The symlink *is* on the same filesystem, wheras the target is not. That's why I'm worried.
[12:56] <gnomefreak> !bugs > NearTotalN00b
[12:56] <kbrooks> PirateHead, there are symlink rules in GNU/Linux
[12:57] <usr_rob> does anyone got a link to a review of the 7.04 release ?
[12:58] <kbrooks> PirateHead, just open up a shell, and go to the directory where the symbolic link is
[12:58] <slackern> usr_rob: it's on yesterdays page on slashdot.org
[12:58] <peter77> I've noticed that I get what looks like a frame refresh ficker while wobbling windows, does anyone else experience this?
[12:58] <alleyoopster> usr_rob: http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=ubuntu
[12:58] <usr_rob> slackern, nice, thx
[12:58] <PirateHead> kbrooks: I renamed the destination file, then double clicked on the symlink in nautilus, and it said "This link is broken. Want to move it to the trash?" and i said, "Yeah!"
[12:58] <tarelerulz_> I can't seem to kill ssh-agent nor can I find it is init.d
[12:58] <CookedGryphon> peter77: compiz or beryl?
[12:58] <usr_rob> alleyoopster, yes, i have read the distrowatch, thx anyway :)
[12:59] <PirateHead> kbrooks: It's an unintuitive way to get the job done, unfortunately.
[12:59] <kbrooks> PirateHead, yes, it is broken now
[12:59] <forza-juve> hi all :)
[12:59] <Leoq2> Hi all, I have a question, when booting 7.04 i stops when choosing normal boot option, but using recovery an "startx" it works perfectly fine. Why?
[12:59] <Rprp>   ChanServ GameServ Global MemoServ NickServ OperServ roconda Rprp WesleySLD
[12:59] <NearTotalN00b> I have another problem...
[12:59] <kbrooks> PirateHead, symlinks are (or work just like, if you want) like windows shortcuts
[12:59] <jon855> what version of xorg does 7.04 has?
[12:59] <apokryphos> pfft :)
[12:59] <Huffalump> I need a bit of handholding/pointing in the right direction.  My upgrade to Fiesty failed and my first/main error at the moment is "failed to load module wfb"  It had another couple lines about I/O errors on the graphics card, so I assume I need to mess with the nvidia stuff.  Help?
[01:00] <NearTotalN00b> My mouse doesn't work with the newest kernel (7.04 upgrade).  It works with an older one, though.
[01:00] <CookedGryphon> Leoq2: any messages? i think you can skip into verbose mode by pressing alt+f2 on startup, that might give you more info
[01:00] <Madpilot> jon855, 7.something
[01:00] <kbrooks> PirateHead:
[01:00] <jon855> thanks mad

[01:00] <Almindor> hey guys, I still get a strange problem with DHCP on fiesty :( (been having this whole beta)
[01:00] <sorcerer> hey iam anew to linux and i downloaded the version for .. linux .. iam running ubuntu can anyone tell me how to install it says pak010.pk4 what kinda file is this
[01:00] <Almindor> randomly (about 1/3 of times) I get no IP assigned on boot
[01:00] <TheoMurpse> ui'm trying to issue commands to iwconfig and i don't have permissions...how do i get them?
[01:01] <Almindor> resetting the interface always helps
[01:01] <sorcerer> sorry i mean .. downloaded quak4 for linux ..
[01:01] <PirateHead> kbrooks: but Nautilus doesn't treat them the same way that Windows Explorer does. It treats them, for all intents and purposes, like the original. For example, if I have a link to an executable in Windows, deleting it says "Deleting the shortcut will not uninstall the program", etc. Here, deleting the shortcut just tries to move the destination file to the trash, and in my case caused an...
[01:01] <Leoq2> yes i get a messege, is there a log file to extract those from? or do I have to copy from screen by pencil?
[01:01] <PirateHead> ...error because the destination file was on a different filesystem.
[01:01] <Almindor> I got 2 NICs, one is net (DHCP) one is static (LOCAL)
[01:01] <Almindor> anyone got any idea why it sometimes doesn't "catch" the ip on the DHCP one?
[01:01] <CookedGryphon> sorcerer: you probably have to copy them into the quake folder, is there not a readme which tells you where to put them?
[01:01] <protocol1> after I completely removed wine with synaptic....is there a way to rid its last config too?
[01:01] <sadleder> TheoMurpse: use sudo iwconfig
[01:01] <|Z_E_R_O|> re
[01:02] <kbrooks> PirateHead, well, that's unintutive, and "non-unixy" so to speak
[01:02] <NearTotalN00b> Anyone know about a 3-button, PS/2 mouse (real IBM one from an old RS/6000) not working with the latest kernel in 7.04?
[01:02] <TheoMurpse> sadleder it asks for password, and mine isn't working
[01:02] <TheoMurpse> sadleder nvm it worked
[01:02] <Tipolosko> protocol1: you must "purge" the package; it'll clean it. I don't work if synaptics has a button for it..
=== engen is now known as Engen
[01:03] <sorcerer> CookedGryphon: mate .. umm this the file that was unrared and iam left with the file pal10.pk4 and when double click on that roller opens up with more files inside .. isnt it a game file .. i know its linux but how do i nstall it ?
[01:03] <sadleder> TheoMurpse: you should check that you are in group admin
[01:03] <PirateHead> Yeah, but intuitiveness gets complicated with relation to Windows, where people come over and expect things to work like Windows does. Symlinks are one of the things I haven't read up on yet, so I don't really understand the "unixy" way to get them to work.
[01:03] <beerman1> Hi, just wondering if anyone can help me with rdesktop running on fiesty?
[01:03] <sadleder> protocol1: just use dpkg -P wine
[01:03] <TheoMurpse> sadleder I would be in whatever group the defaults puts me in when I do a fresh install.
[01:03] <protocol1> Tipolosko, yeah I chose to to completely remove it
[01:03] <Tipolosko> thanks sadleder :D
[01:03] <PirateHead> When I upgraded to Feisty, my sound stopped working, and now whenever an application tries to put out sound (example: Rhythmbox, pressing "play") it crashes. Any ideas?
[01:03] <kbrooks> PirateHead, gnome is not windows. just to be clear: gnome is more "simpler" than windows
[01:03] <Engen> PsySine: asd
[01:03] <forza-juve> hi linux lover, is it possible to make my current ubuntu desktop version become webserver ?
[01:03] <protocol1> sadleder, I will tyr that too
[01:04] <sadleder> TheoMurpse: check with command "groups"
[01:04] <kbrooks> PirateHead, i suggest you reinstall feisty on another computer
[01:04] <protocol1> try*
[01:04] <CookedGryphon> sorcerer: that is just the game data file, you need to get a quake4 package with the actual program in seperately, copyright issues or whatever
[01:04] <Slart> forza-juve: of course.. just install apache
[01:04] <k31th> does latest ubuntu use thunderbird2
[01:04] <TheoMurpse> sadleder Yeah, nevermind. I got it now.
[01:04] <PirateHead> kbrooks: that's a crappy suggestion. This is my only computer.
[01:04] <NearTotalN00b> Thanks for your help.  Bye!
[01:04] <forza-juve> slart : i heard from friend of mine told me to download LAMP
[01:04] <PirateHead> kbrooks: Edgy sound worked just fine.
[01:04] <sorcerer> CookedGryphon:  how do i do that i mean i dont understand what did i just download then and what do i need to get ?
[01:04] <sldkfj> How I would tweak the Usplash resolution so the logo doesn't look like a football (American)?
[01:04] <Slart> !lamp | forza-juve
[01:04] <ubotu> forza-juve: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[01:05] <Slart> forza-juve: lamp includes the webserver.. so that would work too, yes
[01:05] <sadleder> TheoMurpse: what did you get?
[01:05] <TheoMurpse> sadleder I got sudo working
[01:05] <forza-juve> slart : thx man :)
[01:05] <CookedGryphon> sorcerer: http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/07/1547208
[01:05] <sadleder> TheoMurpse: and how?
[01:05] <Slart> forza-juve: you're welcome
[01:05] <PirateHead> sldkfj: Hah. I would also like to figure out how to tweak the usplash resolution. :-)
[01:05] <ROnewbie> I have Feisty Beta on a partition and Edgy on another. I am now in Feisty, and I want to uninstall Edgy from here. How can I do it?
[01:05] <TheoMurpse> sadleder by typing not hitting the wrong key in the password
[01:06] <TheoMurpse> I give up though. The past three releases wireless has always worked on the livecd, and it never works once installed to the hdd
[01:06] <PirateHead> ROnewbie: you can use GParted to delete the parttion that Edgy is on.
[01:06] <mc44> ROnewbie: well, you can just format the partition if you have no data you want on it
[01:06] <TheoMurpse> which boggles my mind, that something would work on teh livecd and then immediately not work once it's installed
[01:07] <stian> I just upgraded from 6.10 to 7.04 using the update manager, but when I log in, the gnome panels are gone, I can't use alt f2 to start anything... all i have are the desktop icons... what gives?
[01:07] <Yeti_69> !fr
[01:07] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[01:07] <CookedGryphon> sldkfj: edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, add vga=791 to the default options, one min i'll get the exact wording of the line
[01:07] <ROnewbie> mc44: sounds better than deleting the partition, how can I do it ?
[01:07] <PirateHead> RONewbie: if you want to expand the Feisty partition to fill the space, however, you will probably have to use GParted off of a LiveCD for that operation, since you can't expand a mounted filesystme,.
[01:07] <sldkfj> CookedGryphon, thanks
[01:07] <Huffalump> PirateHead, something is wrong because that's not how Nautilus works.  If you delete a symlink/shortcut, then it does not delete the original/source file.... but merely the link.
[01:07] <PirateHead> TheoMurpse: it's true that it's unintuitive, but there is a really good reason for it. :-)
[01:07] <TMT[fi] > Hello every1
[01:07] <mc44> ROnewbie: Gparted will let you just format the partition too
[01:07] <stian> also... i have no fiucking window borders!
[01:07] <ROnewbie> PirateHead: I want that partition to remain an empty FAT32 so that I can access it from both feisty and XP (yeah, I'm running a dual boot ... no linux printer drivers)
[01:08] <Huffalump> My upgrade to Fiesty failed and my first/main error at the moment is "failed to load module wfb"  It had another couple lines about I/O errors on the graphics card, so I assume I need to mess with the nvidia stuff.  Help?
[01:08] <sadleder> TheoMurpse ah, ok, the trivial way ;-)
[01:08] <PirateHead> Huffalump: perhaps it was a nautilus bug then? Or perhaps it wasn't truly a symlink, but some other kind of link that I don't know about?
[01:08] <mc44> !ohmy | stian
[01:08] <ubotu> stian: Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[01:08] <LaszloKv> Would anyone here be able to help me with sharing a directory with samba?
[01:08] <ROnewbie> mc44: is gparted avaialble in the repositories, or do i have to use the live cd
[01:08] <ROnewbie> ?
[01:08] <PirateHead> ROnewbie: That's easy to to with GParted. Just reformat the Edgy partition as fat32, and it'll do all the work.
[01:08] <kanpachi> hello, i can't extract a bz2 file :( how can i do it?
[01:08] <mc44> ROnewbie: no its in the repos, just sudo apt-get install gparted
[01:08] <Slart> Huffalump: known bug.. they forgot to include the file in the package.. do a google search for wfb nvidia .. there are solutions
[01:08] <Huffalump> PirateHead, how about a little test?  Make a text file, then a link, and delete the link.
[01:09] <stian> anybody have ANY ideas?
[01:09] <TheoMurpse> PirateHead: The problem is, no one has ever been able to walk me through getting wireless working, and I've never been able to either (despite getting the same wireless running in Debian and Gentoo). So basically, I've been dual booting, with Ubuntu only being used when there's a new version out, hoping and praying that finally wireless works on my computer. It never does, despite the fact that there's no technical explanation -- sin
[01:09] <protocol1> how do I go about removing a directory and everything in it?
[01:09] <Huffalump> Slart - That's ridiculous.  But thanks :)  So, I did search a little but don't quite get it... I have to apt-get nivida-glx or nvidia-glx-new ?
[01:09] <protocol1> what command would I use
[01:09] <TMT[fi] > I have weird problem. I'm using Edgy and timezone reseting after i change it to correct one. How can i change it?
[01:09] <Bakey> rm -r <directory name> protocol1
[01:09] <TMT[fi] > that comp doesn't have internet connection atm.
[01:10] <protocol1> I tried sudo rmdir <dir>
[01:10] <protocol1> ok
[01:10] <Bakey> from the console
[01:10] <PirateHead> kanpachi: The Gnome Archive Manager ought to extract it fine.
[01:10] <ROnewbie> mc44, PirateHead: thankx both
[01:10] <CookedGryphon> sldkfj: okay there's a line that's something like
[01:10] <CookedGryphon> kernel          /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.20-15-generic ro quiet splash vga=791
[01:10] <CookedGryphon> the vga=791 sets it to 1024x768 resolution, if you also edit the line: # defoptions=quiet splash to:
[01:10] <CookedGryphon> defoptions=quiet splash vga=791
[01:10] <CookedGryphon> it will keep working thru kernel upgrades etc.
[01:10] <PirateHead> TheoMurpse: That sucks. It took a lot of fiddling to get my wireless working as well.
[01:10] <sldkfj> CookedGryphon, GREAT!!  thanks
[01:10] <PirateHead> Huffalump: lemme test it now.
[01:10] <Bakey> -r is recursive
[01:10] <bimberi> protocol1: rmdir will only work on an empty directory
[01:10] <TMT[fi] > protocol1: rm -rfv dir
[01:10] <Aarin> can anyone help me? my feisty instalation says that he hasn't detected the disk controller to use. and asks me which one should he use. I've got an Seagate ST380011A and a Seagate ST380013A
[01:10] <PirateHead> Huffalump: the test worked like you said it ought to: it did not delete the original.
[01:10] <Slart> Huffalump: I don't have this problem myself.. but there was someone here asking about it .. 30 mins ago.. I just did a quick google search and one of the first hits was a forum post about it.. with some links to solutions.. but yes.. it does sound ridiculous
[01:11] <jokoon> What command can I use to replace text in a file ?
[01:11] <TheoMurpse> PirateHead: you're right, it does suck. I've probably put in 50+ hours on the wireless issue. It's literally the only reaosn I'm still using XP on my laptop. I could go back to Gentoo and it would all be fine, but I'm tired of compiling everything on a laptop.
[01:11] <Huffalump> PirateHead: good!  Now, I can't think of what went wrong in your original error... but you should be able to use Nautilus with confidence that it works intuitively.
[01:11] <Huffalump> TheoMurpse - Usually, I find the beginning to be a matter of determining how compatible your wifi card is.  If you're a centrino, then it's a slam dunk, for example.
[01:11] <stefg> Aarin: That's the disks, not the controller. can you get fesity to boot by any means?
[01:12] <[Ex0r] > checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[01:12] <Huffalump> Slart - Somehow I didnt get results from the forum, but I will try again.  Thanks for the handholding.
[01:12] <[Ex0r] > anyone know what that error means ?
[01:12] <mc44> TheoMurpse: have you tried removing Network Manager on feisty?
[01:12] <[Ex0r] > I used apt-get install gcc to install gcc
[01:12] <slackern> jokoon: i think 'sed' can do that for you, but im not familiar with how to use it
[01:12] <Bakey> exor do sudo apt-get install build-essential
[01:12] <bimberi> [Ex0r] : install build-essential
[01:12] <TheoMurpse> Huffalump I've used the rt2x00 driver for Gentoo for two years. The same driver is loaded with Knoppix, and it works with Debian. However, when I do Ubuntu, it works only on the livecd.

[01:13] <ubotu> TheoMurpse: Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[01:13] <TheoMurpse> mc44: I think I removed it on edgy and it didn't help.
[01:13] <[Ex0r] > hmm, thanks alot for that, it seems to have fixed the problem
[01:13] <mc44> TheoMurpse: it wasnt installed by default on edgy
[01:13] <TheoMurpse> I then couldn't get the ra2500config util to run for managing my wireless nets
[01:13] <snowblink> grrr launchpad dead
[01:13] <[Ex0r] > oh btw, did they get rid of the 'install lamp server' option on ubuntu server ?
[01:14] <TheoMurpse> mc44: yeah, someone told me to install it for wpa...i did, and nothing helped, so i removed it
[01:14] <Bakey> yw Ex0r
[01:14] <Bakey> i dont' think so Ex0r
[01:14] <Ilgaz> Please put "unsupported" notice to PPC download page?
[01:14] <TMT[fi] > anyone? how can i stop timezone reseting in Edgy?
[01:14] <mc44> TheoMurpse: right, it might be worth trying as it can intefere with some wireless cards
[01:14] <Bakey> tmt is your cmos battery dead?
[01:14] <DVS01> is there another desktop applet package besides gdesklets? one that preferrably doesn't have problems with beryl?
[01:14] <TMT[fi] > No
[01:14] <Bakey> krellim DVS?
[01:14] <Angel-SL> hey
[01:15] <TMT[fi] > Happens only in ubuntu
[01:15] <Angel-SL> i'm getting a medium error when burning 7.04 server.
[01:15] <DVS01> Bakey: thanks, i'll try it
[01:15] <Huffalump> TheoMurpse - I'm not a super-ultra experienced ubuntu warrior, but if you're around later and your wifi doesn't work, I'll be happy to poke at a solution with you.
[01:15] <jokoon> AWESOME
[01:16] <predaeus> DVS01, probably superkaramba
[01:16] <rambo3> apt-cache search widgets
[01:16] <predaeus> DVS01, I think that is for kde though, but be problematic aswell
[01:16] <Angel-SL> i'm getting a medium error when burning 7.04 server.
[01:16] <TheoMurpse> Huffalump thanks. I'm goign to go to bed soon. It's 6am here, and I've got school&work in a few hours. I just started the feisty upgrade and wasn't going to leave my laptop on all night while i slept. I don't trust laptop batteries anymore ;)
[01:16] <DVS01> doh
[01:16] <DVS01> rambo3: good point, thanks
[01:16] <TheoMurpse> so Huffalump I'll look for you in the next 24 hours
[01:16] <[Ex0r] > hmm, anyone here know a solution similar to cpanel, plesk, and ensim, but nowhere near as expensive ?
[01:16] <Bakey> predaeus is right there, i think
[01:17] <lordhelmet> hey all i just upgraded from edgy to fesity, and my shutdown options are gone from the window manager menu (running gdm + kde)
[01:17] <lordhelmet> any ideas?
[01:17] <Bakey> webmin Ex0r?
[01:17] <[Ex0r] > I looked at webmin, but you have to pay for virtual min now
[01:17] <[Ex0r] > and it's the same price as ensim
[01:17] <LjL> There is a netsplit going on. Please keep your messages short, and address the person you're talking to.
[01:17] <Zues_62> can someone help me wif a thing in alsa
[01:17] <sldkfj> CookedGryphon, thanks again, gonna reboot
[01:17] <Zues_62> the volumes are defaulting whn i reboot my pc
[01:17] <Zues_62> what do i do
[01:17] <hoagie> does anyone else has a problem with feisty?
[01:17] <LjL> !netsplit
[01:17] <Zues_62> no hoa
[01:17] <Slart> whatever happened to pulseaudio.. I thought it was going to be the default in feisty?
[01:17] <ubotu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like Freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[01:17] <Slart> hoagie: what problem?
[01:17] <hoagie> Slart: It doesn't boot
[01:18] <Slart> hoagie: nope.. no such problems here
[01:18] <muse> hy
[01:18] <rambo3> [Ex0r] , join #debian and type !webmin
[01:18] <hoagie> Slart: adter installation
[01:18] <[Ex0r] > rambo3- ? I know what webmin is.
[01:18] <lordhelmet> hey all i just upgraded from edgy to fesity, and my shutdown options are gone from the window manager menu (running gdm + kde)...any ideas?
[01:18] <hoagie> Slart: I think it's because of the kernel ?
[01:18] <CookedGryphon> wargh, gaim jsut crashed out on me
[01:18] <bullgard4> On what Web site can I search for channels in the  irc.ubuntu.com network?

[01:18] <Slart> hoagie: might be.. there is a new kernel in feisty.. any weird hardware? or just a regular pc?
[01:18] <zaggynl> Anyone knows what the differences are between feisty beta and latest?
[01:19] <bimberi> zaggynl: a number of version updates
[01:19] <sorcerer> CookedGryphon:  dude the file i have is 2.8 gigs ... i think thats the whole game
[01:19] <hoagie> Slart: No nothing weird, besides edgy and dapper worked perfectly on this pc
[01:19] <sorcerer> CookedGryphon: i need to dwonloaded the installer and then run the pakage ?
[01:19] <zaggynl> bimberi, so, nothing big?
[01:20] <|NewUser|> zaggynl, there is no difference if you keep updating ur beta.. :)

[01:20] <Slart> hoagie: have you checked the bug reports? see if you're the only one?
[01:20] <Angel-SL> someone helppinggg?
[01:20] <lordhelmet> anybody? missing shutdown options?
[01:20] <rambo3> Angel-SL, what kind of an error is that
[01:20] <magnetron> hoagie; maybe you have a grub problem
[01:20] <Bakey> angel did you check your file when you downloaded?
[01:20] <|NewUser|> Angel-SL, did you check ur download ? with md5sum ?
[01:20] <linoleum> please, how can I create a symbolic link ?
[01:20] <zaggynl> |NewUser|, ah okay, I'll wait 'till the servers are a bit faster again then, I'm not getting any updates atm :)
[01:20] <bimberi> zaggynl: some nasty kernel bug fixes and network manager working much better to name a couple I know of.
[01:20] <linoleum> is it like sudo ln -s ?
[01:20] <hoagie> Slart: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/106063
[01:20] <Bakey> check the md5 hash?

[01:20] <rambo3> Angel-SL, did you check md5 ?
[01:20] <zaggynl> ah okay
[01:20] <TheoMurpse> mc44: Hey, waddayaknow, Ubuntu boots up in normal time now. I guess I just had to reboot a few times to get it to work. Unless it's the recently-uninstalled network manager that was causing it to hang what with the finding network connections and all.
[01:20] <NearTotalN00b> I think I have a dying hard drive.  Possibly.
[01:21] <Angel-SL> |NewUser|: erm
[01:21] <Bakey> i think so linoleum
[01:21] <Angel-SL> |NewUser|: UbuntuHash doesnt HAVE 7.04!!!
[01:21] <|NewUser|> zaggynl, US .. servers going fine at the moment :) i m downloading from there
[01:21] <sldkfj> CookedGryphon, uhh, that's not it.  It appears to be shifted over to the right and I get a part of the letter 't' and the last letter 'u' coming off from the left margin.
[01:21] <hoagie> magnetron:: Is there anything I can do?
[01:21] <T0uCH> no one got the torrent of the alternate cd/dvd download ?

[01:26] <ROnewbie> !update | ronewbie
[01:26] <mjr> peekuu, both should work for you
[01:26] <TheoMurpse> rambo3 but my wireless doesn't work at all...now my wired doesn't either
[01:26] <sldkfj> CookedGryphon,  thanks, that gives me something to consume my day :)
[01:26] <Bakey> rgd: i'm not sure, sorry!
[01:26] <TheoMurpse> rambo3 my wired has the 192.168.1.103 ip though

[01:26] <magnetron> peekuu: no, you should download the i386 ("pc") version
[01:27] <brunoUT> ok....
[01:27] <rambo3> TheoMurpse, ok i think there is solution . ping never botherd me since it worked without it . Open worked without ping and WEP worked with ping

[01:28] <LjL> |NewUser|: so do the swedish ones. but i think the "main" servers - i.e. archive.ubuntu.com - actually redirect to the united kingdom ones, so those would probably be the most strained
[01:28] <rambo3> TheoMurpse,search ubuntuforums howto for ralink and ping. You have no wireless security ?
[01:28] <Bakey> angel-sl: this the burn errors :)
[01:28] <|NewUser|> LjL, umm right.
[01:28] <TheoMurpse> rambo3 I do (WPA), but my neighbors don't ;) hehe
[01:28] <Bakey> *thus
[01:28] <rgd> Bakey,thx
[01:28] <magnetron> Angel-SL: do you use bittorent?
[01:28] <brunoUT> LjL: i do not see which lines i should change to the swedish mirrors
[01:28] <Huffalump> Is there a way, at the line command, to tell apt-get to use a specific archive source (that's not in your list)?
[01:28] <brunoUT> can u help me?
[01:28] <orbin> anyone one with a broadcom wireless card?  has implementation in proved in feisty or am i going to have to do the whole ndiswrapper thing again?
[01:28] <rambo3> :P I use publicip as router and open
[01:28] <Angel-SL> magnetron: same error..
[01:29] <LjL> !pastebin | brunoUT, put the entire content here

[01:29] <|NewUser|> !easysource > brunoUT
[01:29] <Bakey> heffalump: i htink you have to edit sources.list manually for that
[01:29] <Angel-SL> magnetron: first utorrent gave me that same error
[01:29] <Angel-SL> now firefox?!
[01:29] <Angel-SL> whats wrong with my indernet
[01:29] <magnetron> Angel-SL: what error?
[01:29] <Angel-SL> download corrupt
[01:29] <Bakey> angel-sl: your internets are broke :)
[01:29] <Angel-SL> both were.
[01:30] <Angel-SL> *gets impaitient*
[01:30] <Huffalump> Bakey: That's bad news, because I'm at a line command due to Fiesty not installing nvidia stuff correctly... and the us.archive keeps timing out, so I want to use another source (like se.archive... or someone fast)
[01:30] <rambo3> Huffalump, where do you live?
[01:30] <LjL> Huffalump, why can't you just change /etc/apt/soruces.list?
[01:30] <LjL> sources even
[01:30] <Bakey> heffalump: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[01:30] <magnetron> Angel-SL: bittorent has a lot of extra checks to prevent corrupt files
[01:31] <Huffalump> rambo3, I'm in RO

[01:31] <Huffalump> LjL, I don't understand how to edit text files in line command
[01:31] <ryeth25> how do i know who staffers are?
[01:31] <LjL> Huffalump: it's  sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list 
[01:31] <Angel-SL> magnetron: actually, it was a 'download ended early' eg, firefox download 356mb and said download complete
[01:31] <Bakey> heffalump: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

[01:31] <Bakey> works mostly like notepad from win
[01:31] <slackern> Huffalump: se.archive.ubuntu.com ?
[01:31] <LjL> Huffalump: or, possibly without the "sudo", if you're in recovery mode
[01:31] <ryeth25> that doesn't do anything when i do that
[01:31] <Bakey> alt o to save
[01:32] <Bakey> alt x to close
[01:32] <Huffalump> thanks Bakey and LjL editing now without sudo
[01:32] <Bakey> if I recall
[01:32] <magnetron> Angel-SL: don't use fx for large downloads
[01:32] <ryeth25> LjL:  what is that supposed to do?
[01:32] <Angel-SL> magnetron: wget?
[01:32] <ATi7500> how to create a script with these commands?
[01:32] <ATi7500> ifconfig ethX down

[01:32] <LjL> brunoUT: this line,  deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy ude , which is the only one using the GB mirrors, is wrong
[01:32] <Huffalump> Bakey / LjL - "WriteOut" is to save?
[01:33] <brunoUT> i never changed it....what does it need to be?
[01:33] <Bakey> heffalump: yes
[01:33] <Huffalump> ok
[01:33] <Bakey> alt-o i think...
[01:33] <Bakey> then alt-x closes
[01:33] <Huffalump> ctrl+o
[01:33] <Huffalump> got it, thanks folks
[01:33] <Bakey> ahh, my bad
[01:33] <slackern> it's control - x and control - o
[01:33] <nihil> hey - i've got question - how to add application to Applications -> Games menu ? i realized that i must create a .desktop file in usr/share/applications, but i don't know how i should describe 'Categories'
[01:34] <brunoUT> LjL: what should i change it to?
[01:34] <LjL> brunoUT: at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16539/ i've just removed that line
[01:34] <brunoUT> LjL: thanks
[01:34] <Bakey> nihil: it should get created when you install a game
[01:34] <LjL> brunoUT: to nothing, because it simply doesn't make any sense. but really, i would use source-o-matic to rebuild a good list
[01:34] <CookedGryphon> nihil: you could just use the menu editor, right click on the menu and say edit menus
[01:34] <k31th> does ubuntu latest ship with Mozilla Thunderbird 2?
[01:34] <Pici> nihil: Use the alacarte menu editor, I'm not sure if its installed by default though.
[01:34] <rambo3> !alacarte | nihil
[01:34] <magnetron> Angel-SL: try wget?
[01:34] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about alacarte - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:34] <nihil> Barkey, but it's PRBOOM and it's not created
[01:34] <Bakey> nihil: if not, restart gnome by ctrl-alt-del
[01:34] <spikeb> k31th, no.
[01:34] <Bakey> nihil: ahh, ok
[01:34] <magnetron> nihil: right click the menu to edit it
[01:34] <LjL> brunoUT: especially given that you don't have universe or multiverse enabled. if that's intentional, ok, but most people have them enabled
[01:35] <k31th> hum is there a back port??
[01:35] <Bakey> nihil: +1 to what magnetron said
[01:35] <brunoUT> yeah i just enabled them
[01:35] <Huffalump> Of course, it helps if I spell Feisty... and not the party-like Fiesty... :))
[01:35] <bef_> all of my repositories seem messed up, none of my packages will download or install from Synaptic.. Feisty 15/4 daily.
[01:35] <brunoUT> im very new i did not know how to enable them
[01:35] <Amaranth> alacarte has been installed by default since dapper
[01:35] <LjL> brunoUT: oh - also, i missed soemthing. you have the Feisty CD in your sources, but the rest of the list is all Edgy?!
[01:35] <rashid> hello ppl
[01:35] <LjL> brunoUT: what distribution are you actually using?
[01:35] <brunoUT> LjL: dude i dont know how that happened
[01:35] <tom__> my fiesty log off menu missing shutdown & restart, anyone have this?
[01:36] <LjL> brunoUT: well, which distribution do you *want* to use?
[01:36] <brunoUT> LjL: i am using 6.10
[01:36] <brunoUT> i want to upgrade to 7.04

[01:36] <magnetron> !upgrade > brunoUT
[01:36] <LjL> brunoUT: ok, then i'll give you a "good" sources.list, and then hopefully you can upgrade using just update-manager. if nothing was messed up too bad
[01:36] <stiffme1983> hello everyone
[01:37] <Huffalump> Apparently dpkg is locked in a previous apt-get instance/attempt.  How can I kill/unlock that, so I may proceed with apt-getting.

[01:38] <nihil> Bakey, i think that something is wrong with Categories
[01:38] <foof> can you install once and then just pretend ubuntu is debian and use apt for everything?
[01:39] <DjViper> foof: yes?
[01:39] <Huffalump> why not?
[01:39] <Dextorion> How do i do a complete reinstallation of a program with apt-get?  I broke something and i need to reinstall the program completely. If i do apt-get remove, and then install i get the same fault.
[01:39] <LjL> brunoUT: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16540/ (you can click on the "Download as text" link to get rid all of the line numbers). after using this as your /etc/apt/sources.list, type  sudo apt-get update , and then fire up the update manager as the !upgrade documentation says, and see if you can upgrade cleanly to Feisty
[01:39] <Huffalump> foof, I use apt-get more and more instead of the GUI
[01:39] <gils> man the DVD iso torrent i have is SLOOOOOW
[01:39] <DjViper> how can a torrent be slow?
[01:39] <replman> when i install sun-java-6-jdk, is it better to remove gij first?
[01:39] <DjViper> gils: did you open the bt port in your router?
[01:40] <brunoUT> LjL: can i not just copy and paste into my sources.list?
[01:40] <gils> port #?
[01:40] <slackern> Dextorion: you could add --purge when removing, that will delete all configs and such also
[01:40] <Christopherl> Cannot send mail from Evolution 2.10.1, but can receive mail. Some port is blocked? Using Ubuntu 7.04.
[01:40] <rambo3> replman, it doesnt matter
[01:40] <gils> DjViper: What port should it be
[01:40] <TooR4u> how to Upload the files into remote mechine ...?I have conneted to a site.I know the password.how to upload the files from my directory to the remote mechine
[01:40] <replman> rambo3: thank you!
[01:40] <hakwaa> hi, I've noticed that ssh and all ssh-based apps (scp, etc) run significantly slower after updating to Feisty. does anyone recognize this problem?
[01:40] <gils> DjViper: i dont use torrents oftehn
[01:40] <foof> does ubuntu use its own repository, or a combination of its own and the official debian repository?
[01:40] <oktay> Hello sirs, I hope my current unannounced visit finds you in good spirits.
[01:40] <Dextorion> slackern: tried that aswell actually. But when i do install later on, i still get the same fault.  Its my eclipse that is broke, and it looks for startup.jar. But that file doesnt get installed when i do apt-get install eclipse.
[01:41] <DjViper> gils: hm google it, bittorrent+nat :)
[01:41] <Huffalump> foof, its own
[01:41] <gfather> hay guys
[01:41] <smo> anyone know ubiquity right?
[01:41] <LjL> brunoUT: yes, that's what you should do. just click on "Download as text" first, and paste *that*, otherwise you'll also paste all the line numbers and cruft
[01:41] <Dextorion> slackern: Even if i do --reinstall, or --purge when i do remove.
[01:41] <LjL> brunoUT: which, obviously, won't work ;)
[01:41] <jrib> foof: its own repository, but the packages are synced with debian every release
[01:41] <oktay> i shall require as to how to add the feisty CD to the sources list and do an upgrade via this very same CD.
[01:41] <gfather> where i can find ubuntu latest releas
[01:41] <gfather> ??
[01:41] <tarzeau> there won't be feisty powerpc version?
[01:41] <rambo3> gfather, /topic
[01:41] <TooR4u> how to Upload the files into remote mechine ...?I have conneted to a site.I know the password.how to upload the files from my directory to the remote mechine
[01:41] <slackern> Dextorion: hmm i had a similar problem way back but that was with some monitoring software, worked fine on debian but not on ubuntu
[01:41] <Pici> !ppc
[01:41] <ubotu> PowerPC.  Formerly used by Apple for the Macintosh line of computers. Variants are now used in popular gaming consoles. PPC was a fully supported Ubuntu architecture up to and including edgy. It is now a community port, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCFAQ
[01:41] <jrib> gfather: www.ubuntu.com click download
[01:41] <oktay> gfather: ubuntu.com.. even google. come on
[01:41] <LjL> brunoUT: direct link - http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16540/plain/
[01:41] <tarzeau> TooR4u: using rsync, lftp, scp?
[01:41] <spikeb> tarzeau, not an official release, but a community port. which is out.
[01:42] <tarzeau> spikeb: where?
[01:42] <Huffalump> gfather try http://ubuntu.com
[01:42] <Pici> tarzeau: See ubotu's message above.
[01:42] <slackern> Dextorion: could it be that you need to install some java package before?
[01:42] <TooR4u> tarzeau, okey i will try 1min
[01:42] <finalbeta> Does Feisty's codec install feature include support for WMA etc? Or does that still require 3th party repo's?
[01:42] <slackern> Dextorion: that has been missed in dependencies or something?
[01:42] <atomiku> hmm
[01:42] <LjL> finalbeta: the latter, i suspect
[01:42] <Dextorion> slackern: alrihgty.  Strange this..  Its on my work machine, and i just had eclipse installed. But decided that it needed a reinstallation.
[01:42] <Dextorion> slackern: no idea.
[01:42] <foof> without starting any flames, why ubuntu over debian? :)
[01:42] <spikeb> tarzeau, http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ports/releases/feisty/release
[01:42] <atomiku> I'm having trouble with the nvidia drivers, X fails to start (saying it cant load the drivers)
[01:42] <slackern> Dextorion: I can try to install it here and see what happens
[01:42] <atomiku> It was working fine :P
[01:42] <finalbeta> LjL: yeah, I assumed as much 2. Kind off kills the whole point of it.
[01:43] <tarzeau> spikeb, Pici thanks
[01:43] <DjViper> foof: newer software, larger community
[01:43] <brunoUT> LjL: thanks....but i have to head off to class before i can update
[01:43] <user-land> hi, is the upgrade to 7.04 problematic ?
[01:43] <brunoUT> hopefully that works when i get back
[01:43] <jrib> finalbeta: I can play them here and don't think I installed any gstreamer plugins by hand
[01:43] <gfather> thanks
[01:43] <bimberi> oktay: 1. needs to be the alternate cd.  2. insert it into a running system and follow the prompts
[01:43] <spikeb> tarzeau, if you end up installing it, come back and let me know how it is - i have a family member waiting to see if she should upgrade or not :)
[01:43] <finalbeta> jrib: nice.
[01:43] <slackern> Dextorion: downloading and installing now
[01:43] <oktay> bimberi: shoot. i already have the regular cd. full upgrade it is then. Thanks !! :)
[01:43] <LjL> finalbeta: well, you *really* cannot distribute the Win32 codecs. that, Ubuntu just cannot do. still however, VLC should be able to play some WMA's, and maybe gstreamer can do the same
[01:43] <enry> !codec

[01:43] <MenZa> Can anyone tell me how I choose sound card1 rather than sound card0 to play my sound?
[01:43] <Huffalump> user-land - each experience is unique.  most people seem just fine.  I, however, have troubles with a bug related to nvidia drivers.
[01:43] <oktay> tarzeau: i thought you used debian
[01:44] <user-land> thanks, huffalump.
[01:44] <spikeb> debian is what my ppc using family member is going to be using if the community port sucks heh
[01:44] <user-land> i remember the upgrade 6 month ago was problematic for a lot of users.
[01:44] <Dextorion> slackern: cool
[01:44] <slackern> Dextorion: it installed here and started
[01:44] <user-land> they had to make a new install to avoid problems.
[01:44] <user-land> so this time the upgrade is smooth for most ?
[01:44] <Dextorion> slackern: should work. I bet it just me that broke it when uninstalling or something
[01:44] <slackern> Dextorion: want a list of the packages it installed?
[01:45] <crolle17> can somebody tell if it is possible to do some regexp with vi?
[01:45] <ferronica> how to make my windows drive read and write??? both
[01:45] <foof> Are any ports better supported on debian?  I've got an amd64 box.
[01:45] <nicolah> is it possible to upgrade to feisty using the dvd as a repo ?
[01:45] <atomiku> So uh yeah, Any idea why startx is failing to load due to not being able to load the nvidia drivers?
[01:45] <stefg> !ntfs-3g | ferronica
[01:45] <ubotu> ferronica: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but please remember to keep backups of critical data. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[01:45] <MenZa> Can anyone tell me how I choose sound card1 rather than sound card0 to play my sound?
[01:45] <hakwaa> exit
[01:45] <spikeb> foof, they're officially supported, so yeah
[01:45] <Huffalump> user-land, in my case the bug is quite amazing... someone (apparently) did not include all the necessary bits and pieces for nvidia drivers under certain conditions.  I've seen some very confused people killing themselves to solve it... esp when i look in the mirror.  But I know it's not affecting everyone.
[01:45] <Dextorion> slackern: nah.. im quite sure i have them, its just..  i dont understand why it doesnt install that startup.jar file.
[01:45] <tarzeau> oktay: i do :)
[01:45] <MenZa> !sound
[01:45] <ubotu> If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/index.php?page=DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[01:45] <tarzeau> oktay: it's for others, not me
[01:45] <Dextorion> slackern: it should reside inside /usr/lib/eclipse or something like that.
[01:45] <crolle17> i mean it is possible to insert some character by regexp?
[01:45] <Christopherl> how do I open/close ports in Ubuntu 7.04?
[01:45] <oktay> tarzeau: good for you :)
[01:45] <ferronica> stefg: right now i am in ubuntu 6.10 :(
[01:45] <tarzeau> oktay: and you, ubuntu?
[01:45] <jrib> !firewall > Christopherl    (Christopherl, see the private message from ubotu)
[01:46] <Dextorion> slackern: yup, /usr/lib/eclipse/startup.jar.
[01:46] <oktay> tarzeau: yeah. for a while now.
[01:46] <ferronica> stefg: i wanna use right now fstab
[01:46] <tarzeau> oktay: making packages too?
[01:46] <user-land> you almost killed yourself, huffalump ?
[01:46] <foof> thanks everyone!
[01:46] <Huffalump> user-land, I think one should not have to reinstall.  That's generally the last resort of an impatient person not willing to reach out for help / learn a little something.
[01:46] <stefg> ferronica: this is edgy... please read the link ubotu gave you
[01:46] <oktay> tarzeau: no sir. i am just an end-user :)
[01:46] <Huffalump> user-land, until this nvidia bug is solved for me, I am not to be allowed near razor blades.
[01:46] <slackern> Dextorion: -rw-r--r--   1 root root 34173 2007-04-10 19:07 startup.jar there it is
[01:46] <user-land> huffalump, how can you reach out when the computer does not boot to x-server ?
[01:47] <oktay> tarzeau: i stopped messing with the OS too much when work got busy :). nowadays i just use the stuff.
[01:47] <ytsestef> Firefox flash doesn't work!! and i cant install it from adobe becuase i'm on x64.. what can i do?
[01:47] <Dextorion> slackern: yeah.. i dont have it anymore.  And it doesnt get installed together with eclipse.
[01:47] <slackern> Dextorion: i could maybe upload it for you somewhere to try with if you want
[01:47] <tarzeau> oktay: no time to play nethack?
[01:47] <dfasfadsfdas> anyone know the package name for adobe pdf and nonfree fonts addon in synaptic is?
[01:47] <jrib> !flash > ytsestef    (ytsestef, see the private message from ubotu)
[01:47] <Dextorion> slackern: yeah..  could try :)  I bet there are more files missing but hey.. we could try
[01:47] <CompuChip> Hi.
[01:47] <spikeb> ytsestef, you could use gnash, or you could install nspluginwrapper and try and work with that to make the x86 flash work
[01:48] <oktay> tarzeau: not really. not even time for irc.
[01:48] <tarzeau> oktay: briquolo? brutalchess? supertransball2? mazeofgalious? pathogen? www.mtp-target.org? bub-n-bros.sf.net?
[01:48] <Huffalump> user-land, good point.  I am fortunate enough to have a second machine where I'm writing from at the moment.  Seems to me, however, that there's been line-command IRC since the olden times... not that I know how to use it, but I've seen it.  Maybe a quick refresher is in order before you head down the primrose path?  Just in case of any unpleasantries, of course.
[01:48] <xplode_me> hi! After i upgraded to feisty (from edgy) gnome is going crazy. I have some applications on the startup list (gnome-session-properties) but they only show up minutes later. Anyone knows how to fix this?
[01:48] <Tom47> dfasfadsfdas: try the search function
[01:48] <ytsestef> thanks spikeb and jrib!
[01:48] <slackern> Dextorion: i'll just zip the folder so you get all in it
[01:48] <spikeb> ytsestef, you bet :)
[01:48] <Dextorion> slackern: cool :)
[01:49] <user-land> thanks, huffalump, you may have saved me a day downtime. i have nvidia.
[01:49] <CompuChip> I was updating from Edgy to Feisty  when my laptop overheated and shut down. Now when I start up in recovery mode, it says "Waiting for root system" and then tells me /dev/hda2 (where it is installed) does not exist and drops to a (initramfs) shell. Any solutions except reinstall completely?
[01:49] <DjViper> how do I make ubuntu connect to a default wlan when I boot up?

[01:50] <yellow_chicken> i have 6.10 and applied all the updates, now i have 2 kernel versions, 2.6.17-10 and 2.6.17-11.  should i use -11 to upgrade to ubuntu 7.04?
[01:50] <bimberi> jono: only when you buy me that pint! ;P
[01:50] <spikeb> yellow_chicken, yeah probably
[01:50] <jono> bimberi: :)
[01:50] <yellow_chicken> but the default is 2.6.10
[01:50] <spikeb> yellow_chicken, i dont think it will matter what you're actually running as long as both are installed.
[01:50] <user-land> thanks, huffalump, so i will wait.
[01:50] <DjViper> jono: dugg
[01:51] <atomiku> Hmmm Restricted Drivers Manager is complaining that it needs some linux-kernel module, but when I try to apt-get install it, it says it has no installation candidate
[01:51] <CompuChip> yellow_chicken after upgrading to -11 it set that to default here
[01:51] <yellow_chicken> anyone did a upgrade? if so how long did it take?
[01:51] <spikeb> probably take forever over the net  given the pounding the servers are getting.
[01:52] <yellow_chicken> i think it's very congested at this time
[01:52] <spikeb> yes it is.
[01:52] <Anss1> How do I highlight rows with my nick or special keywords in Gaim/Pidgin?
[01:52] <ubuntu_noob> hello, how do I fix error: *** SDL_image has no PNG support! You need SDL_image with PNG support?
[01:52] <DjViper> how do I make ubuntu connect to a default wlan when I boot up?
[01:52] <zaggynl> Anyone knows a now playing plugin for xchat2 ? I can't find it :<
[01:52] <Anss1> ...which is the Edgy default IRC client.
[01:52] <CompuChip> Re my problem: when I boot from Live CD I *can* mount /dev/hda2 manually, through the shell I get when booting from HDD doesn't show anything starting with hda under /dev
[01:52] <spikeb> hmm
[01:52] <atomiku> E: Package linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-11-generic has no installation candidate
[01:52] <atomiku> Hmm?
[01:52] <rashid> how do i install java version 6
[01:52] <spikeb> Anss1, that used to be in preferences, but it might have moved to a plugin.
[01:53] <yellow_chicken> spikeb:  i did a fresh install of 6.10, and have to update 165 packages, took like 30 to 40 minutes
[01:53] <user-land> all the best, huffalump.
[01:53] <Valstorm2379> anyone in?
[01:53] <Anss1> spikeb, I looked through the plugins, to no available.
[01:53] <enry> the video in internet are all framed
[01:53] <enry> no fluid
[01:53] <spikeb> hmm
[01:53] <Valstorm2379> Anyone know a USB format program that runs through Ubuntu?
[01:53] <jrib> atomiku: what version of ubuntu?
[01:53] <spikeb> Anss1, im not sure then. i hate using gaim for irc heh
[01:53] <atomiku> 7
[01:53] <enry> wowww
[01:53] <atomiku> I'm trying to get my nvidia drivers working again you see
[01:53] <jrib> atomiku: that package isn't on 7.04.  Why are you installing it?
[01:54] <atomiku> Well
[01:54] <verb3k> guys my brother's CD/DVD reader is old and extremely slow ....is there a faster way to install ubuntu without downloading the alternate CD ? Thanks in advance
[01:54] <atomiku> Im trying to get into the Restricted Drivers manager thing
[01:54] <Valstorm2379> Also, anyone remember the link for packages/software I can't remember it.
[01:54] <atomiku> its saying it needs that package to run
[01:54] <eifzon> !nvidia-drivers
[01:54] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidia-drivers - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:54] <gilnim> hello
[01:54] <atomiku> yeah
[01:54] <atomiku> Ive tried installing the nvidia drivers
[01:54] <bimberi> Valstorm2379: packages.ubuntu.com ?
[01:54] <Anss1> Well spikeb, as an Linux trainer and consultant, I hate that people can not trust the default programs.
[01:54] <atomiku> But then X fails to start
[01:54] <jrib> atomiku: hmm, sounds buggy... can you pastebin the exact error?
[01:54] <atomiku> Well
[01:54] <Valstorm2379> sweet thanks
[01:54] <Valstorm2379> :D
[01:54] <atomiku> X is saying it couldnt load the nvidia drivers
[01:55] <ubuntu_noob> hello, how do I fix error: *** SDL_image has no PNG support! You need SDL_image with PNG support?
[01:55] <atomiku> so atm I'm using the default xorg.conf
[01:55] <spikeb> Anss1, gaim/pidgin weren't designed particularly for IRC. if i were in charge, xchat would be the default client :)
[01:55] <gilnim> does someone know a restorationtool for getting back information from a formatted harddisk?
[01:55] <jrib> ubuntu_noob: what gives you that error?
[01:55] <slackern> Dextorion: im sending it now but i'm capped at 100k/sec out so will take a little while
[01:55] <Valstorm2379> Atomiku, you need to follow the step by step guide.
[01:55] <atomiku> .
[01:55] <atomiku> I have...
[01:55] <atomiku> lol k I'll try again

[01:55] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[01:55] <slackern> Dextorion: it'll take around 10min
[01:55] <gilnim> !restore
[01:55] <bimberi> gilnim: i've heard good things about photorec.  stand by I'll check what package it's in
[01:55] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about restore - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[01:56] <atomiku> As of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) the recommended way to install the binary drivers is to use System -> Administration -> Restricted Devices Manager.
[01:56] <ubuntu_noob> jrib, when compiling wesntoh
[01:56] <atomiku> Now how am I going to do tjhis if I cant get into restricted devices manager?
[01:56] <jrib> ubuntu_noob: why compile?  It's in the repositories, use Add/Remove or Synaptic
[01:56] <crolle17> i read somewhere that this should be possible with vim: :s/pattern/string/flags (regexp)
[01:56] <jrib> !info wesnoth | ubuntu_noob

[01:57] <verb3k> sorry for repeating the question ,but I really need your help.My brother's CD/DVD reader is old and extremely slow to the extent that prevented me from insalling ubuntu on it ....is there a way to install ubuntu in a fast way without downloading the alternate CD for text mode? Thanks in advance
[01:57] <ubuntu_noob> jrib,well, I wanted learn how to compile and 1.2.3 is not the latest version
[01:57] <BrokenLinux> Hey can anyone recommend me a nice IRC client besides xchat-gnome and gAIM?
[01:57] <crolle17> jrib so for example this should replace risk with ceis_risk shouldn't it? -> :s/risk/ceis_risk
[01:57] <mc44> atomiku: what does 'uname -r' say for you?
[01:57] <jrib> ubuntu_noob: sudo apt-get build-dep wesnoth      should help
[01:57] <atomiku> 2.6.17-11-generic
[01:57] <jrib> crolle17: on the current line, yes
[01:57] <mc44> atomiku: well youj arentt on feisty then
[01:57] <atomiku> I am
[01:58] <mc44> atomiku: not with that kernel
[01:58] <Valstorm2379> Atomiku could it be you got the wrong kernels?

[01:58] <atomiku> Wait wait wait I know what has happened here
[01:58] <mc44> atomiku: you havent rebooted?
[01:58] <crolle17> jrib but when i want to do it with the whole document?
[01:58] <atomiku> Its updated the /boot/ config on the wrong partition
[01:58] <Jowi> verb3k, there should be a minimal install cd available that downloads most stuff from the net. not sure it is available for feisty yet though ( see !install )
[01:58] <atomiku> It updated the wrong grub config
[01:58] <Valstorm2379> My error msg was: This kernel is version number, conflict etc.
[01:58] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: thanks
[01:58] <jrib> crolle17: put a  %  before the s
[01:58] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: yw :)
[01:58] <atomiku> Also
[01:58] <crolle17> jrib will do so.
[01:58] <atomiku> Setting up nvidia-glx-new (1.0.9755+2.6.20.5-15.20) ...
[01:58] <ubuntu_noob> jrib, is there a direct way to fix the issues instead of going the other way around and downloading deps
[01:58] <atomiku> is that the one I need?
[01:58] <mc44> atomiku: yes
[01:59] <atomiku> Okay
[01:59] <verb3k> Jowi: Thanks Jowi ..... I really appreciate your help
[01:59] <kaiyang> hi, may i know is there any security issue if i use the desktop edition to run as a server? because i am not comfortable with the commandline in server edtion
[01:59] <Huffalump> atomiku, that's what I understand... but that has not worked for me.
[01:59] <atomiku> Now lemme pull the updated grub config and put it on the right partition
[01:59] <stiffme1983> edgy
[01:59] <mc44> atomiku: but you really need to be in the correct kernel
[01:59] <Jowi> verb3k, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[01:59] <stiffme1983> sorry
[01:59] <CompuChip> Anyone here that's good at solving startup problems? I don't feel like re-installing my system
[01:59] <atomiku> Be right back guys, thanks for the help mc44 and Huffalump
[01:59] <jrib> ubuntu_noob: I don't know what the issue is, but if it's a dependency one then that command will fix it
[01:59] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: xchat won't install on feisty :/
[02:00] <ubuntu_noob> jrib, alright thanks anyways
[02:00] <stiffme1983> does any one have sound problem using Intel HD audio?

[02:02] <atomiku> Ive got a problem here, I have two partitions (one boot partition one main partition) both mounted to /
[02:02] <Maximilian1st> sorcerer, ./quake4...
[02:02] <atomiku> I cant seem to get to /boot/ on the boot partition
[02:02] <jrib> crolle17: you know about the help system?   :he :s
[02:02] <atomiku> what shall I do?
[02:02] <ubuntu_noob> jrib, thanks alot
[02:02] <atomiku> unmount the boot partition (thats currently mounted as /) and mount it elsewhere?
[02:03] <atomiku> I cant unmount it
[02:03] <crolle17> jrib do you mean man vi?
[02:03] <sorcerer> Maximilian1st:  just ./quake4 ?
[02:03] <atomiku> Looks like im going to have to do this from the livecd be back in a bit
[02:03] <jrib> crolle17: nope, try the command I said above,     :he :s
[02:03] <CompuChip> atomiku, you're not in the dir are you :)
[02:03] <atomiku> what
[02:03] <Jowi> atomiku, reboot. no good to have several partitions mounted to the same dir (without its own subdir that is)
[02:03] <crolle17> jrib will do so.
[02:03] <atomiku> welkl
[02:03] <atomiku> look
[02:04] <CompuChip> you can't unmount the directory if you're inside it
[02:04] <atomiku> I have a 4gig partition set as boot
[02:04] <orbin> kaiyang: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ServerFaq/
[02:04] <Maximilian1st> nope, ./quake4... ...being the rest of the name of the .run
[02:04] <Maximilian1st> I was lazy
[02:04] <atomiku> and grub is installed on that partition
[02:04] <atomiku> then I have ubuntu on another partition
[02:04] <Maximilian1st> ./quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run
[02:04] <atomiku> they both seem to be mounted on /
[02:04] <orbin> kaiyang: see the "What's the difference between desktop and server?" section.
[02:04] <atomiku> lol ill just brb
[02:05] <nozey> someone using toshiba satelite + feisty?
[02:05] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16545/
[02:05] <Valstorm2379> ahhh
=== engen is now known as Engen
[02:05] <Valstorm2379> Anyone know about a USB formatting software?
[02:05] <BrokenLinux> nozey: I'm using a satellite + feisty
[02:05] <nozey> BrokenLinux, whats your network card?
[02:05] <naja_> re tout le monde
[02:05] <Valstorm2379> LOOKING for USB formatter that works through Ubuntu.
[02:05] <sorcerer> Maximilian1st: this is the file ....               quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.runbash: quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run: command not found
[02:05] <orbin> kaiyang: my reading of that is you're no more or less secure.  it's just optimized for servers which are sometimes low specced.
[02:05] <crolle17> jrib lots of help-txt-files...
[02:05] <Maximilian1st> sorcerer,  make your file executable chmod +x quake4
[02:05] <crolle17> jrib need a lot of time to read them :)
[02:06] <sorcerer> Maximilian1st: i dunno how to do that .. iam noob ..
[02:06] <hawk> sorcerer: he just told you how
[02:06] <whatspy> good morning... I can't figure how to set the midnight commander default text editor to "vim" ?
[02:06] <kaiyang> i see thanks. it's helpful. but the support period for dapper is different. server is longer than desktop why??
[02:06] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: done a 'sudo apt-get update' recently?
[02:06] <sorcerer> hawk:  where do i do this ..
[02:06] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: let me try that
[02:06] <jrib> crolle17: yep, every command is documented.  and if you just do  :he  you'll get a manual that you can read through (slowly of course or else you'll forget everything very fast)
[02:06] <kaiyang> since they are basically the same thing
[02:06] <Maximilian1st> sorcerer, in the command line.
[02:06] <magnetron> Valstorm2379: use "Disk Management" in "Add/Remove Programs"
[02:06] <Maximilian1st> sorcerer, chmod +x quake4
[02:07] <hawk> sorcerer: in the directory where quake4 is
[02:07] <jo_> hello people
[02:07] <Valstorm2379> disk management okay thanks
[02:07] <CompuChip> I was updating from Edgy to Feisty  when my laptop overheated and shut down. Now when I start up in recovery mode, it says "Waiting for root system" and then tells me /dev/hda2 (where it is installed) does not exist and drops to a (initramfs) shell. Any solutions except reinstall completely?
[02:07] <Valstorm2379> :d
[02:07] <crolle17> jrib true. my brain is getting older day by day... ;)
[02:07] <sorcerer> this is what i get   chmod +x quake4chmod: cannot access `quake4': No such file or directory
[02:07] <hdxx> hey, does somone using kubuntu feisty fawn? works all fine?
[02:07] <ikonia_> CompuChip boot into recovery mode from the cdrom and see if /dev/hda2 exists
[02:07] <ikonia_> hdxx many people
[02:07] <solowlr> where do I find the grub configuration file in Ubuntu?
[02:07] <ikonia_> solowlr /boot/grub
[02:08] <jrib> hdxx: for many people it works fine, some of trouble I'm sure
[02:08] <CompuChip> ikonia_, When I boot into Live mode from CD it exists. I can even mount it
[02:08] <vega-> solowlr: /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:08] <orbin> sorcerer: need to pass the full filename, type quke4, then press tab
[02:08] <orbin> *quake4
[02:08] <magnetron> !grub > solowlr
[02:08] <Zobert> hey guys
[02:08] <ikonia_> CompuChip its possible your chipset is not loaded/supported under fesity
[02:08] <kelvin> can someone help me with my samba75 edge usb?
[02:08] <Zobert> if anyine needs a feisty mirror: http://www.kitsirota.com/soft/linux/ubuntu/feisty/
[02:08] <CompuChip> I don't think the upgrade was complete
[02:08] <coz_> Ok guys, fresh install feisty releses, eveytime I reboot I have to reinstall the nvidia drivers  < I thought youguys fixed that?
[02:08] <hdxx> ok cool, because i'm updating right now
[02:08] <ikonia_> Zobert the mirrors are listed on the ubuntu site
[02:08] <ikonia_> CompuChip there you go then
[02:08] <hobe> Can I expect my internet connection (ADSL with Alcatel Speedtouch 330) to work ater upgrading to feisty? I mean after the upgrade to dapper, the firmware directory had changed. Is there anything similar to expect?
[02:09] <Tvinky> !grub
[02:09] <ubotu> grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[02:09] <ferronica> any one here know how to mount windows drive manipulating /etc/fstab  ?
[02:09] <CompuChip> ikonia_, I know that is the problem. But how do I fix it. How can I resume the upgrade when I can't boot into my system? :)
[02:09] <ferronica> read and write both
[02:09] <ikonia_> hobe check the ghardware compatability list, chances are if it worked in 6.06 or 6.10 it will be dine
[02:09] <PirateHead> Happy 4/20, everybody.
[02:09] <ikonia_> CompuChip fresh install
[02:09] <coz_> also alacare menu editor still does not work with the debian menu installed
[02:09] <ikonia_> PirateHead what ??
[02:09] <bostik__> hi all
[02:10] <CompuChip> ikonia_ :( so just make a fresh install and then try the upgrade again
[02:10] <Maximilian1st> sorcerer, You need to give the full name of the app you want to make executable with chmod +x
[02:10] <bostik__> is there a reason for italian ubuntu mirror not listed ?
[02:10] <ferronica> i used this line to read and write--- >/dev/sdb1       /windows ntfs nls=utf8,umask=0222 0 0
[02:10] <Mikhael> ferronica: /dev/sda1        /mnt/c           vfat        ro,umask=000     1   0
[02:10] <ikonia_> CompuChip or just install fesity fresh rather than upgrading to it
[02:10] <PirateHead> When I upgraded to Feisty, my sound card stopped working. Additionally, Rhythmbox crashes when I try to play a song. Why might that be?
[02:10] <sorcerer> Maximilian1st:  iam doing it .. the tab but doiesnt complete its stange
[02:10] <NessieLiberation> ferronica: if it's ntfs and you want read/write, use ntfs-3g
[02:10] <ferronica> Mikhael: for ntfs and sdb1 not sda1

[02:11] <CompuChip> ikonia_, now we're at it: would it help to put for example /home and /etc on another partition? So that I won't lose all my settings when something like this happens again?
[02:11] <Maximilian1st> sorcerer, you need to be in the same folder as the file.
[02:11] <ikonia_> ferronica ntfs write support is not native to the kernel
[02:11] <RARCA> Just downloaded the new ubuntu....  What is the skype to use for it?
[02:11] <ikonia_> CompuChip you can't put /etc on a seperate partition
[02:11] <Mikhael> ferronica: install ntfs3g if you wanna write NTFS partitions
[02:11] <kelvin> any networking EXPERT around??? from the 1300 peoples?
[02:11] <NessieLiberation> !ntfs-3g | ferronica
[02:11] <ubotu> ferronica: ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but please remember to keep backups of critical data.

[02:11] <ferronica> ikonia : so wont paste anything to my windows
[02:11] <yag4mi> Hi, what does it mean 'leave packages that are not available' under synaptic's preferences?
[02:11] <ikonia_> kelvin just ask the question
[02:11] <sorcerer> Maximilian1st:   chmod +x quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.runchmod: changing permissions of `quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run': Operation not permitted
[02:11] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: seems like I'm having a problem, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16546/
[02:11] <peter07> hi
[02:12] <ikonia_> ferronica paste anything into your windows ?
[02:12] <RARCA> hey peter
[02:12] <yag4mi> does it mean it'll delete packages after apt lists are updated?
[02:12] <hdxx> sorcerer, chmod +x
[02:12] <hdxx> ah you did it
[02:12] <ferronica> ikonia: i tried to manipulate fstab
[02:12] <kelvin> ikonia: i am using samba 75 usb edge modem....i am problem to use it on my ubuntu..
[02:12] <Trist_an> sorcerer, try with sudo
[02:12] <ferronica> ikonia: i used this line to read and write--- >/dev/sdb1       /windows ntfs nls=utf8,umask=0222 0 0
[02:12] <ikonia_> ferronica what are you trying to do
[02:12] <ikonia_> kelvin is it supported
[02:12] <ikonia_> ferronica you can't write to NTFS partitions
[02:13] <RARCA> What skype version should I use for Ubuntu?
[02:13] <ikonia_> RARCA the one thats in the ubuntu repo
[02:13] <sorcerer> ok it worked .. with sudo .. now what do i type to run teh game ?
[02:13] <ikonia_> sorcerer read the quake 4 docs on it
[02:13] <RARCA> Thx ikonia
[02:13] <kelvin> ikonia:i know....suddently i cannot use it anymore..the modem is fine in wndows....
[02:13] <Trist_an> ./ quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86 I think, it should install it
[02:13] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: yes, i'd try another mirror ...
[02:13] <ferronica> ikonia: i wanna clean install ubutnu 7.04 so i wanna copy paste my some Mp3 and Movies in windows
[02:13] <bimberi> !mirrors | BrokenLinux
[02:13] <ubotu> BrokenLinux: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[02:13] <sorcerer> this is in the command line .
[02:13] <ikonia_> kelvin if it works in windows has no relecence to ubuntu
[02:13] <kelvin> !samba
[02:13] <ubotu> samba is is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT
[02:13] <NessieLiberation> ikonia_: you can write to ntfs partitions with ntfs-3g
[02:13] <ikonia_> sorcerer read the quake 4 docs
[02:14] <LaszloKv> Would someone be able to help me out with samba settings to share a folder.  I've been working on this for hours...
[02:14] <sorcerer> man all this just to install agame on ubuntu ...
[02:14] <ikonia_> NessieLiberation I know this - but he's not using that
[02:14] <Trist_an> ferronica, then you should restrat under windows and grap the files from it maybe
[02:14] <CompuChip> ikonia_: thanks, I'll do that.
[02:14] <NessieLiberation> ikonia_: ok
[02:14] <ferronica> Oh
[02:14] <ikonia_> sorcerer just read the docs - and you won't have "all this"
[02:14] <yag4mi> NessieLiberation, does it ever mess up your FS/the remaining partitions?
[02:14] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: Do I change what mirror I'm using in synaptic or something?
[02:14] <peter07> I've just finished my update to feisty, and I have problem with beryl. Beryl always detects aiglx but I have xserver-xgl and Composite Disabled and  Option  "AIGLX" "off"
[02:14] <Trist_an> sorcerer, you should also now be able to bouble click on the file to install it
[02:15] <peter07> How I can force beryl to use xgl??
=== buckaroo is now known as vorbote
[02:15] <Guest_750> Anyone has md5hash for Feisty desktop iso?
[02:15] <ferronica> there is no way to copy paste my ubuntu 6.10 data to windows :(
[02:15] <NessieLiberation> yag4mi: i know plenty of people who'se used it, and they've nevre had a problem
[02:15] <CompuChip> ferronica, which data?
[02:15] <Stromberg> hi i have problems installing the nvidia drivers. should i just do apt-get install nvidia-glx and it should work?
[02:15] <ryanakca> Anybody know what the package for ACE is? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_%28editor%29
[02:15] <Trist_an> ferronica, there is with ntfs-3g but...
[02:15] <ferronica> CompuChip: Mp3 and Movies :)
[02:15] <ikonia_> ferronica not at your level no
[02:15] <orbin> ferronica: http://www.fs-driver.org
[02:15] <NessieLiberation> ferronica: use an external HD with FAT partitions, or use ntfs-3g
[02:15] <Stromberg> i do sudo nvidia-glx-config enable then and after that X wont start anymore
[02:15] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  umm it says .. no permision granted when i double click the file ???/
[02:16] <boubbin> how to install legacy invidia drivers in feisty ?
[02:16] <ferran> how can change /dev/eth2 for /dev/eth1?  i have install ubuntu 7.04 with usb net :(
[02:16] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: you can modify mirrors via synaptic but probably the easiest way is to edity /etc/apt/sources.list directly
[02:16] <magnetron> !nvidia > Stromberg
[02:16] <orbin> ferronica: then you can read the ext3 partitions from windows
[02:16] <ikonia_> sorcerer read the docs - stop asking in here, this is nothing to do with ubuntu
[02:16] <Supaplex> ferran: udev rules
[02:16] <ferronica> ikonia: tell me i will try to do
[02:16] <Stromberg> thx ikonia
[02:16] <boubbin> !nvidia
[02:16] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:16] <Trist_an> sorcerer, ok if you are still in terminal type sudo chown your_username:your_username name of the file
[02:16] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: 'gksudo "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list"'
[02:16] <CompuChip> ferronica I made a separate fat partition for that: windows will automatically find it and in Ubuntu you can mount it under /data or whatever you like
[02:16] <Trist_an> so do I CompuChip
[02:16] <ikonia_> CompuChip that would be his best solution, I agree
[02:17] <CompuChip> Only problem is you will lose data when you want to do that after your installation
[02:17] <Trist_an> sorcerer, when done double click again on the file
[02:17] <CompuChip> unless you use an external hard disk
[02:17] <ikonia_> sorcerer just read the docs - it tells you all this
[02:17] <yag4mi> well, with feisty folk who have old nvidia cards are being left out of the beryl loop- but then again, its a pain to have beryl running on lesser powerful graphics cards, irrespective of how cool it looks.
[02:17] <ikonia_> yag4mi you don't have to use beryl
[02:17] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: ok, that worked...so I just replace http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ with another mirror I find?
[02:17] <ikonia_> yag4mi fesity is nothing to do with your card being too old to run new software
[02:17] <yag4mi> i know- ikonia - but it was nice while it lasted on edgy
[02:18] <CompuChip> yag4mi I use beryl with my not-so-recent nvidia card
[02:18] <yag4mi>  :)
[02:18] <boubbin> how to install nvidia-legacy drivers in feisty ?
[02:18] <ikonia_> !nvidia >boubbin
[02:18] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: yes, choose one from that page ubotu mentioned
[02:18] <yag4mi> ikonia, is it possible using the previous release of the nvidia driver?
[02:18] <ikonia_> yag4mi I'd advise against it
[02:19] <ikonia_> yag4mi try the nvidia-legacy package
[02:19] <yag4mi> i have nvidia-glx-legacy. and its possible to use beryl with it?
[02:19] <yag4mi> (if so, woo hoo).
[02:19] <Trist_an> sorcerer, is it working now?
[02:19] <ikonia_> yag4mi it will run, but how well is debatable
[02:19] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  umm mate .. that line is giving issues ..
[02:20] <Trist_an> sorcerer, can you pastebin the output?
[02:20] <RARCA> what client should I use for IRC?  Is there one built in already?
[02:20] <ikonia_> Trist_an come on - this isn't quake support
[02:20] <willwill> i have tried to run 7.04 beta in VMware and it show error:http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/3857/fawnalergicci9.jpg is this fixed in the stable version?
[02:20] <Valstorm2379> How do I get disk manager to run in the terminal??
[02:20] <ikonia_> Trist_an he';s not even reading the docs that tells you how to setup the executable
[02:20] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  this is the file name what do you wat me to type b4 it quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run
[02:20] <Valstorm2379> what's the command for it??
[02:20] <hdxx> RARCA, xchat
[02:20] <RARCA> Thx hdxx
[02:20] <ikonia_> sorcerer last request, please stop asking about quake and read the docs
[02:20] <Trist_an> sorcerer, what is your username
[02:20] <RARCA> Is xchat built in?
[02:20] <willwill> (that's edubuntu 7.04 beta remastered by reconstructor)
[02:21] <Supaplex> RARCA: install it
[02:21] <CompuChip> sorcerer chmod +x
[02:21] <yag4mi> Valstorm2379, the disk manager? you mean fdisk? or something like gpart?
[02:21] <boojit> hi, I'm debugging what appears to be a bug in Ubuntu Feisty with gnome-vfs and secure DAV folders. Does anyone here have time to test against my DAV folder and see if they can replicate the bug?
[02:21] <Trist_an> ikonia, it will teach him how to install other x86 packages
[02:21] <RARCA> Thx supaplex
[02:21] <Trist_an> CompuChip, no he has to chown
[02:21] <Valstorm2379> I mean Disk Management
[02:21] <ikonia_> Trist_an so would reading the docs and not being spoon fed how to change permissions
[02:21] <Terminus> hello. i just installed feisty and sound isn't working. kernel modules are loaded (snd_emu10k1) but i'm not getting any output. anybody having the same problem?
[02:21] <ap1> Where are the Feisty release notes? So I know what has changed?
[02:21] <Valstorm2379> I need to format a USB card hence I need to run Disk M.
[02:21] <sorcerer> guys please understand .. your ubuntu .. forums are set up for newbies and hence isnt ubuntu for poeple to use with ease ... ??
[02:22] <Valstorm2379> I just can't get it to run because it keeps saying I don't have right to mount and such.
[02:22] <yag4mi> Valstorm2379, then type `sudo fdisk`
[02:22] <sorcerer> so please bare with me .. it does relate to getting packages installed in UBUNTU ..
[02:22] <sorcerer> just bare with me thank you
[02:22] <Valstorm2379> errr are you sure??
[02:22] <yag4mi> wait - its `sudo fdisk /dev/path`
[02:22] <ikonia_> sorcerer your not doing anythign to do with ubuntu - your trying to get a 3rd party product to run without reading the 3rd party docs
[02:22] <ikonia_> sorcerer this is nothing to do with ubuntu
[02:22] <boojit> apl: perhaps you want this? https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/feisty-changes/
[02:22] <yag4mi> yes, if you want to format it, you can use that application
[02:22] <Valstorm2379> So I'd have to figure out the path of the USB card, right?
[02:22] <boojit> apl: but that's a lot of detail
[02:22] <sorcerer> arent i trying to install it in .. ubuntu ??
[02:22] <hdxx> RARCA, sudo apt-get install xchat
[02:23] <yag4mi> Valstorm2379, usb disk, you mean?
[02:23] <Valstorm2379> yah
[02:23] <Trist_an> sorcerer, then please give m your username. When you login, what username are you using?
[02:23] <ikonia_> sorcerer but the problems are nothing to do with ubuntu, as I said, last request to stop discussing quake 4
[02:23] <yag4mi> do this `ls /dev/sd*`
[02:23] <yellow_chicken> anyone upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04? any problems in the way?
[02:23] <ProN00b> 7.04 out yet ?
[02:23] <sorcerer> i mean yeah its a flavour of linux .. but its ubuntu and besides peopel who switch from windows .. dontr know linux file systems .. and managment ..
[02:23] <RARCA> hdxx thx
[02:23] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  sorcerer
[02:23] <CompuChip> sorcerer do you call the Microsoft help desk when you try to install a program that was ported from Linux and is potentially unstable in Windows? :)
[02:23] <yag4mi> that'll usually give all the available usb disk devices.
[02:23] <apo_> Hm... any ideas why traceroute6 tells me that a host is unknown while ping6 has no problems?
[02:23] <Valstorm2379> I mean a USB memory stick. sigh.
[02:23] <Dropbear> Upgrade broke my system
[02:23] <bimberi> ap1: hmm, somehow I don't think http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/704 is quite what you're after
[02:24] <yag4mi> Valstorm2379, same thing.

=== Sn00py is now known as do7
[02:24] <Valstorm2379> is it then for me sudo /media?
[02:24] <Valstorm2379> I mean sudo fdisk /media?
[02:24] <Trist_an> then sorcerer type sudo chown sorcerer:sorcerer quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run
[02:24] <Wanderer> anyone know the package names for Thunderbird 2?  No package updtes so far
[02:24] <ikonia_> Valstorm2379 /media is not a disk device
[02:24] <ikonia_> Wanderer what version of ubuntu
[02:24] <Supaplex> Valstorm2379: fdisk needs a block device.
[02:24] <sorcerer> CompuChip: no mate i dont even bother .. dont get me wrong .. i am glad this channel exists .. but .. come one .. not many people wanna write commands to get apps working .. i love ubuntu .. and linux .. well its diffcult but a good challenge
[02:24] <yag4mi> no, Valstorm2379 - that is actually the mount point. in linux, the physical device reference is at another location
[02:24] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: check this out, http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic/
[02:24] <Wanderer> ikonia: feisty, thunderbird 1.5 is installed
[02:25] <yag4mi> which usually is, /dev/somedevice
[02:25] <ikonia_> Wanderer there is no thunderbird 2 yet
[02:25] <ap1> bimberi and boojit: no, those references do not cut it. They do not tell about new features in a compact document.
[02:25] <Valstorm2379> ahh
[02:25] <Wanderer> ikonia_: ok released, not ported and packaged.  thanks
[02:25] <ikonia_> Wanderer spot on
[02:25] <Valstorm2379> How would I find out the physical ref?
[02:25] <Valstorm2379> any quick command for it?
[02:25] <yag4mi> i told you earlier. type : ls /dev/sd*
[02:25] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: yes i've seen that.  Wasn't sure if it would give you a wide choice of mirrors though.
[02:25] <Valstorm2379> kay thanks
[02:25] <Wanderer> ikonia_: thanks for the straight answer :.
[02:26] <ikonia_> Wanderer a pleasure to have someone want a straight answer
[02:26] <boojit> apl: well GEE sorry man. Maybe your lack of description in your original question is what doesn't cut it, not the link.
[02:26] <ProN00b> hay, giev update howto teh now ke ?!?!!
[02:26] <Hasrat_USA> good morning. what's the command for finding out the release number of an Ubuntu distribution?
[02:26] <ikonia_> Hasrat_USA lsb_release -a
[02:26] <magnetron> !update > ProN00b
[02:26] <taggie> valstorm2379: plug in the usb, and type "dmesg" look at the last few lines for the /dev/sdX
[02:26] <yellow_chicken> does upgrade remove old open office? or just install a new instance and link to new path
[02:27] <ikonia_> yellow_chicken it upgrades
[02:27] <Terminus> hello. i just installed feisty and sound isn't working. kernel modules are loaded (snd_emu10k1) but i'm not getting any output. anybody know how to fix this? previously worked in dapper.
[02:27] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  did you get my message ?
[02:27] <LjL> ap1: perhaps https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/feisty ?
[02:27] <boubbin> how to install nvidia-legacy drivers in feisty (kubuntu) ? adept wont find legacy drivers
[02:27] <ap1> I mean, I am looking for a document which allows me to weigh the benefit of Feisty upgrade compared to the trouble of possible new bugs.
[02:27] <IdleOne> !nvidia
[02:27] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[02:27] <Trist_an> sorcerer, nope. Are you a registered user?
[02:27] <ikonia_> boubbin do you haev the correct repo enabled
[02:27] <LjL> sorcerer: the command line is not that hard, when you've got documents to follow step by step. they tell you to type some thing, and you type said thing. that's it. if you encounter problems, *then* ask. (but remember we can't thorougly support 3rd party products)
[02:27] <Hasrat_USA>  the upgrade upgrades openoffice to 2.2
[02:27] <boubbin> ikonia_: how to enable it in feisty ?
[02:27] <yellow_chicken> Terminus: did you update all the packages on 6.10 before you upgrade to 7.04?
[02:27] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  here is the link http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16548/ ..
[02:28] <ikonia_> boubbin the same as in every other ubuntu release
[02:28] <sorcerer> LjL:  aight mate ..
[02:28] <boubbin> ikonia_: so how is that done :P
[02:28] <IdleOne> !repos > boubbin   (boubbin, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:28] <BrokenLinux> bimberi: got xchat, thanks for all your help :)
[02:28] <ikonia_> boubbin the software managment menu
[02:28] <LjL> operation not permitted?
[02:28] <RARCA> I am having problems accessing the web from Ubuntu.  I can access google.com and no other sites.  Any suggestions?  It seems the bundled chat client can connect to the net.
[02:28] <Terminus> yellow_chicken: this is a fresh feisty install.
[02:28] <yag4mi> yeah, nice feature they've added this time- the software management.
[02:29] <bimberi> BrokenLinux: cool, np :)
[02:29] <Trist_an> hey ikonia he (sorcerer) cannot sudo chown the file....
[02:29] <LjL> sorcerer: is that file located on an NTFS (or Windows, anyway) filesystem?
[02:29] <yag4mi> but still, it'd be nicer if ubuntu had something that runs similar to source-o-matic natively.
[02:29] <bulmer> RARCA: what do you mean only google.com? can you ping the other sites?
[02:29] <sorcerer> ohh shit guys .
[02:29] <ikonia_> Trist_an apologies I wasn't paying attention
[02:29] <LjL> !language
[02:29] <sorcerer> its on a fat32 drive
[02:29] <ikonia_> sorcerer now bad language too
[02:29] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[02:29] <RARCA> when I ping other sites it does not bounce back.
[02:29] <sorcerer> my bad sorry
[02:29] <ap1> RARCA, are you on a FON WLAN AP? They allow only Google by default...
[02:29] <magnetron> !ohmy > sorcerer
[02:29] <yellow_chicken> Terminus: the instruction on ubuntu says you need to update all the packages for feisty first before upgrade to 7.04
[02:29] <LjL> sorcerer: move it to your home directory first.  mv quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run ~/ 
[02:29] <CompuChip> 700 MB @ 500 kb/s takes a long time :)
[02:30] <jimwhimpey> I had to restart my Ubuntu box which is entirely controlled via ssh on another computer, I've rebooted in the past and had it restart with ssh fine before but this time I've restarted it and I can't connect via ssh. I also accidentally deleted the GUI so I can't really just hook up a screen, get it running and then get rid of the screen again. What can I do?
[02:30] <do7> i have a version of ubuntu running on a cd.how do i save it to run without cd on my pc
[02:30] <feNNec_> Hi !
[02:30] <RARCA> ap1: what is that?
=== evil is now known as g8m
[02:30] <yellow_chicken> Terminus: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[02:30] <Terminus> yellow_chicken: this isn't an upgrade. it's a fresh install off the feisty alt cd.
[02:30] <LjL> sorcerer: then  cd ~ , then again  sudo chown sorcerer:sorcerer  quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run 
[02:30] <ikonia_> do7 click the install icon
[02:30] <yellow_chicken> Terminus: sorry
[02:30] <yag4mi> sorcerer, you should've said, 'oh, feces'
=== kaiyang_ is now known as kaiyang
[02:30] <TmsK> hi
[02:30] <ikonia_> sorcerer this is ALL explained int he quake 4 docs
[02:30] <do7> ikonia_ it wont damage my windows heh
[02:30] <JebJoya> right, i've got some issues, first things first - Amarok will not install, I get an issue stating "amarok: Depends: python-qt3 but it is not going to be installed" any fixes?
[02:30] <ikonia_> do7 not it you install it to a seperate partition
[02:30] <ap1> RARCA, forget it if you don't know.
[02:30] <yag4mi> JebJoya, try #amarok
[02:31] <RARCA> k
[02:31] <TmsK> where can i search about dmraid in ubuntu 7.04
[02:31] <yag4mi> superb support
[02:31] <TmsK> :P
[02:31] <CompuChip> jimwhimpey you deleted the GUI but you can still log in through a terminal, right?
[02:31] <JebJoya> okay, noone was talking in there last time :S
[02:31] <plux> jimwhimpey: hook up a screen to it and use the terminalinterface (you will be greeted by something similiar you see when you do ssh)
[02:31] <do7> ikonia_ thanks
[02:31] <yellow_chicken> Terminus: feisty was beta for so long, i got mixed up. i took feisty as edgy
[02:31] <CompuChip> jimwhimpey so just hook up a screen and log in
[02:31] <feNNec_> Edgy -> Feisty upgrade pb: update manager doesn't give the cell to upgrade
[02:31] <ikonia_> TmsK for the record I personally don't believe dmraid is worth while at this time
[02:31] <TmsK> its supported in the installer?
[02:31] <yag4mi> JebJoya, yeah - thats assuming they are around :P
[02:31] <Terminus> yellow_chicken: hehehe.
[02:31] <TmsK> ikonia<- ok
[02:31] <wamty> Xubuntu is better than ubuntu?
[02:31] <jimwhimpey> CompuChip: with the GUI gone, when I boot up I'll be greeted with a command line?
[02:31] <ikonia_> wamty personal taste
[02:31] <rukuartic> Does anyone know why ctrl+alt+backspace reboots instead of restarting XOrg like it used to?
[02:31] <magnetron> !best > wamty
[02:32] <VSpike> does the bot do !advocacy ? :)
[02:32] <CompuChip> jimwhimpey yes, like plux said. And if not, you can press Ctrl + Alt + F1 and then you should.
[02:32] <VSpike> !advocacy
[02:32] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about advocacy - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[02:32] <jimwhimpey> brilliant, thanks!
[02:32] <taggie> wamty xubuntu tends to be faster on older/slower boxes, but "better" is a very subjective thing.
[02:32] <willwill> is this http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/3857/fawnalergicci9.jpg fixed in stable version of 7.04? (it is edubuntu 7.04 beta running on vmware workstation on windows xp)
=== Wolfi is now known as xwolfi
[02:32] <wamty> are there sepcial video cards for xgl support?
[02:32] <yag4mi> i prefer the best apps from different DEs.
[02:32] <jo_> wamty: you can install ubuntu and than install xubuntu as an optional windowmanager at startup, its good in some ways and bad in others, check it out
[02:33] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  hey mate .. sudo cho worked in the terminal .. now whats to run the thing now ?
[02:33] <JebJoya> yag4mi:  the issue seems to be kinda feisty based, since if i try sudo apt-get install python-qt3 i get: "right, i've got some issues, first things first - Amarok will not install, I get an issue stating "amarok: Depends: python-qt3 but it is not going to be installed" any fixes?"
[02:33] <boubbin> ikonia_: err, those images in the wiki arent even close to what I see in my adept ?
[02:33] <Trist_an> could anyone pastebin me his custom fluxbox menu plz... I'm too lazy to make my own ;)
[02:33] <Notchnick> why when I try to use a gparted live cd to repartition the drives it would say monitor out of range after choosing the language?
[02:33] <Terminus> anyway, if anybody knows why i can't get sound, please let me know.
[02:33] <wamty> are there sepcial video cards for xgl support?
[02:33] <ikonia_> sorcerer read the quake 4 docs, PLEASE
[02:33] <Trist_an> sorcerer, double click the icon
[02:33] <JebJoya> whooops
[02:33] <guest_> how are u
[02:33] <JebJoya> ignore that last thing
[02:33] <wamty> so?
[02:33] <ikonia_> boubbin sorry I have no idea what your talking about, I don't remember you asking me a question
[02:33] <ma3x> where can I get xorg.conf sample?
[02:33] <jo_> wamty: what videocard do you have?
[02:33] <jrib> !xconfig > ma3x    (ma3x, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:33] <ikonia_> ma3x you have one installed from xorg packages
[02:33] <spikeb> JebJoya, i was wondering when apt got so talkative
[02:33] <harpi> hello, i need some help installing a alien aplication on ubuntu. is there a seperat channel for that?
[02:33] <spikeb> haha
[02:33] <sorcerer> Trist_an: i did man .. still no permision when asking to .. make DIr
[02:33] <wamty> are there sepcial video cards for xgl support?
[02:34] <ma3x> ikonia, I dont have them installed
[02:34] <ikonia_> harpi I'd advise against it
[02:34] <LjL> harpi: err, i suppose not. you mean installing an RPM via alien?
[02:34] <VSpike> How easy is it to move a root fs from one partition to another?
[02:34] <ikonia_> VSpike very
[02:34] <ma3x> I need a sample xorg.conf
[02:34] <boubbin> ikonia_: about enabling repos in kubuntu feisty.
[02:34] <VSpike> A bootable one
[02:34] <ikonia_> boubbin ooh yesd
[02:34] <JebJoya> what i meant was that sudo apt-get install python-qt3 gave: " python-qt3: Depends: python (< 2.5) but 2.5.1~rc1-0ubuntu3 is to be installed"
[02:34] <jrib> ma3x: for what purpose?
[02:34] <ikonia_> VSpike very easy
[02:34] <yag4mi> JebJoya, thats over my head. you might want to try update apt-get and then retry- its unfamiliar territory...package conflicts that is
[02:34] <ikonia_> boubbin are you using ubuntu or kubuntu
[02:34] <LjL> JebJoya: pastebin your sources.list
[02:34] <theoryx> hello :) i just installed linux and wonder where to set what OS is default? when booting...
[02:34] <ma3x> jrib, I changed a lot of stuff, and now I cant get to reconfigure it
[02:34] <ma3x> I must manually edit
[02:34] <auridius> Hi, downloaded feisty yesterday, i386. Hardware support is splendid on my box, everything works...but when i try to connect to a wifi network with WEP key, my system crashes. Whats wrong with the networkmanager?
[02:35] <Trist_an> sorcerer, then in terminal sudo  ./quake4-linux-1.4.1-sdk.x86.run
[02:35] <LjL> theoryx: gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:35] <LaszloKv> Trist_an do you know what to do beyond what you had in the samba conf file?  Because I am still having a hell of a lot of trouble...
[02:35] <JebJoya> LjL: where can i find sources.list?
[02:35] <theoryx> ok, thnx
[02:35] <wamty> is Xgl the Novell project? I think the stuff Novell was doing required proprietary ATI drivers or something.
[02:35] <qebab> quick question: my ubuntu shipped with python 2.4, and I've now installed python 2.5, how do I make the command 'python' in terminal route to 2.5 instead of 2.4?
[02:35] <wamty> are there sepcial video cards for xgl support?
[02:35] <jrib> ma3x: you receive an error when you try the command ubotu gave you to reconfigure it?
[02:35] <LjL> JebJoya: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[02:35] <boubbin> ikonia_: kubuntu
[02:35] <harpi> ljl no it is a program called iip it is a unvisebel chat for irc, there is a source for it
[02:35] <Trist_an> LaszloKv, no, it worked for me after that
[02:35] <LjL> !pastebin > JebJoya    (JebJoya, see the private message from Ubotu)
[02:35] <_voila> Hello
[02:35] <jo_> wamty:  aiglx is better, nvidia supports both from xorg 7.01 on in combination with xvideo
[02:35] <ikonia_> boubbin I don't use that, but check in #kubuntu and I'm sure soeone will have the right screen shots to show you
[02:35] <VSpike> ikonia_: I figured it would be.  I need to do a clean install. Got feisty ready to go.  Got a spare partition but it's a bit smaller than ideal for long term.  I'd like to install there, and then when I'm totally happy with it, move it over my currrent edgy install
[02:35] <ma3x> jrib, I don't know how to configure X for my video card I get errors when I play ppracer
[02:36] <_voila> does anyone have some tips with installing/setting up DNS on Edgy ?
[02:36] <LjL> harpi: and it comes in what shape? why did you call it an "alien" application?
[02:36] <ikonia_> VSpike should not be a problem
[02:36] <jrib> ma3x: what errors?
[02:36] <ma3x> when I play ppracer it terminates and it resizes my screen (big) and it says File r300_vertexprog.c function t_dst_index line 184 unknown output 3
[02:36] <ma3x> and then r300_ioctl.c:683: r300AllocDmaRegion: Assertion 'rmesa->dma.current.ptr <= rmesa->dma.current.end' failed
[02:36] <Notchnick> Need help: why when I try to use a gparted live cd to repartition hard drives it would say monitor out of range after choosing the language?
[02:36] <VSpike> ikonia_: Cool. Thanks
[02:36] <LaszloKv> Trist_an, Damn... I still get an error that seems to be a permission denial
[02:36] <harpi> alien as i not know for ubuntu
[02:36] <qebab> quick question: my ubuntu shipped with python 2.4, and I've now installed python 2.5, how do I make the command 'python' in terminal route to 2.5 instead of 2.4? <= I might word myself better to say I want 'python' in terminal to link to python 2.4 instead of python 2.5
[02:36] <wamty> guys?
[02:36] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  ok it worked ..

[02:37] <qebab> 2.4.4, more specifically, robertj
[02:37] <ikonia_> ta
[02:37] <ikonia_> jrib ta
[02:37] <LjL> sorry didn't look
[02:37] <robertj> qebab: i don't know if thats managed via alternatives or not
[02:37] <Joseaa> Hello, can anyone please help. I restarted my gnome using ctrl + alt backspace and now I can't get it back. It shows a black screen displaying with a busy cursor sign.
[02:37] <JebJoya> LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16549/
[02:37] <Joseaa> anyone ?
[02:37] <qebab> hm
[02:37] <ikonia_> LjL I thought you'd left, hence the call. Bit quick draw - sorry
[02:38] <robertj> qebab: I don't know much about it but man alternatives or google debain alternatives would probably help you determine if it was and if so how to change it
[02:38] <qebab> there isn't a way to 'relink' it to /usr/bin/env python 2.5 instead of /usr/bin/env python 2.4?
[02:38] <LjL> ikonia_: no it's ok, i just didn't notice jrib had taken care of it already
[02:38] <rukuartic> Yeah, I've been having issues with ctrl+alt+backspace. It reboots now...
[02:38] <arch_> when I click on my optical drive in nautilus, or try to type "mount /media/cdrom0", it tells me that /dev/scd0 doesn't exist, maybe a problem with my fstab?
[02:38] <qebab> python2.4/python2.5*
[02:38] <jo_> Joseaa: what videocard do u use?
[02:38] <qebab> okay, thank you robertj
[02:38] <Joseaa> rukuartic: it is not reboot..It's stuck likethis for a while .
[02:38] <Joseaa> jo_:  nividia
[02:39] <jrib> ma3x: yes, that's a strange error.  But if you receive it only with ppracer that suggests it's a problem with ppracer
[02:39] <rukuartic> Joseaa: Yea I've had issues with mine rebooting. its not stuck though... We're having different problems.
[02:39] <magnetron> Joseaa: i had that problem too, try ctrl alt bkspace again
[02:39] <ma3x> jrib, how do I test glx?
[02:39] <wamty> should I try vidia geforce 6800 - 7800 ?
[02:39] <CompuChip> yay, feisty 97% download
[02:39] <wamty> whats the 6800 ????
[02:39] <jo_> Joseaa: good, perhaps xorg wrong configured, did you try ctrl alt f1?
[02:39] <wamty> i mean 7800
[02:39] <jrib> ma3x: try   glxgears
[02:39] <JebJoya> LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16549/
[02:39] <theoryx> ok... editing menu.lst.. what line do i have to change to make a OS default?
=== quad3datwork is now known as heather2
[02:40] <ikonia_> theoryx the line that says "default"
[02:40] <CompuChip> theoryx put it at the top, is one way. Or count which number it is and put it at "default
[02:40] <jo_> Joseaa: what driver are u using?
[02:40] <mlu> Hi: Just upgraded to Feisty and now have one issue: DMA on my Harddrives doesn't work. It's Intel Chipset and piix-module is loaded.
[02:40] <Joseaa> It's working now after ctrl+alt+backspace again. I was bit skeptical on using it before because of the busy cursor sign .
[02:40] <CompuChip> theoryx if you do the last, note it starts at 0
[02:40] <ikonia_> mlu tried hdparm
[02:40] <LjL> JebJoya: you have Universe enabled in the main repository, but not in the Updates repository. that's a no-no. i'll fix the file for you.
[02:41] <JebJoya> yikes, right, lemme see
[02:41] <LjL> JebJoya: actually, nevermind. i'm wrong.
[02:41] <jo_> Joseaa: i know this from bad configured xorg, check your xorg.conf and your drivers
[02:41] <ndlovu> can anyone help me debug a simple GIMP script-fu function? I got the function part from a google search, but had to create the register sections myself (see http://paste.uni.cc/14729). Registering brings up the following error: "...does not take the standard <Image> Plug-In args. (INT32, IMAGE, DRAWABLE)"
[02:41] <theoryx> what is the line chainloader?
[02:41] <JebJoya> LjL: Oh :(
[02:41] <ikonia_> ndlovu you may have better support in #gimp
[02:41] <mlu> ikonia: Yes - HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted (and I am root)
[02:42] <ikonia_> mlu not a problem, just checking
[02:42] <ndlovu> ikonia_, thanks, I've tried there already :( (seems nobody's home)
[02:42] <LjL> JebJoya: ok, for some reason you've got a newer version of Python available than the one that's provided by edgy (and required by python-qt3)
[02:42] <ikonia_> mlu I have seen a problem where the smart monitor interferees with it
[02:42] <LjL> JebJoya: please type  apt-cache policy python  and give me the output
[02:42] <ikonia_> ndlovu just hang around in #gimp, someone will wake up
[02:42] <bostik__> italian mirror not listed here https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
[02:42] <rukuartic> hum. Anyone know how I can go about configuring the compiz thingy?
[02:42] <bostik__> any idea why ??
[02:42] <jo_> mlu: you have pata or sata or scsi drives?
[02:42] <ikonia_> bostik__ its not an official mirror
[02:42] <oRGy> hey guys, any fix for the window bar problem in compiz yet?
[02:43] <bostik__> sure
[02:43] <mlu> ikonia: Ok, can I just disable the smart monitor and how do I do iet?
[02:43] <bostik__> it is
[02:43] <sorcerer> Trist_an:  i give up .. after installing i dont even see it in the games directory or doenst even prompt me to copy the files over
[02:43] <jrib> rukuartic: there is a 'gnome-compiz-manager' in the repos.  No idea if it is any good.  Otherwise, use gconf-editor
[02:43] <ikonia_> mlu do you have the smart monitor intstalled ?
[02:43] <Barnab1> hi all
=== ask__ is now known as AskHL
[02:43] <rukuartic> jrib: Thanks
[02:43] <LjL> JebJoya: (the reason is probably that you have the Feisty CD listed as a source. are you trying to upgrade to feisty?)
[02:43] <ubuntu> hi all
[02:43] <mlu> ikonia: Not sure - what is it?
[02:43] <JebJoya> LjL: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16550/
[02:43] <ikonia_> mlu smartd
[02:43] <JebJoya> LjL: I have upgraded to feisty, and i do have the CD as a source
[02:43] <dmd_password> that such people
[02:43] <_Rappy_> I'm going to backup my homedir, but I never can remember if its   tar -c /home/myhomedir   or /home/myhomedir/  (the last with an / at the end)
[02:44] <mlu> ikonia: Ok, I'll have a look into that.
[02:44] <jo_> mlu if you have sata or pata or scsi drive hdparm wont work and all options like dma are enabled by default
[02:44] <Barnab1> any solution yet to get the deskop effects working with an ATI X1600?
[02:44] <ikonia_> _Rappy_ tar cvf $path/to/tar /path/to/source
[02:44] <LjL> JebJoya: you haven't really upgrade to feisty, most of your sources (all except for the CD, actually) are Edgy sources
[02:44] <harpi> ljl i have opened a private chat, my visual is not that good anymore and i have big fonts anabled to read this but....it is going way to fast for me , so if you don't mind
[02:44] <JebJoya> LjL: *facepalm*
[02:44] <LjL> JebJoya: how did you [attempt to]  upgrade?
[02:44] <rukuartic> jrib: Tried ctrl+alt+bksp lately? It rebooted me... why'd it change, and can I change it back?
[02:44] <JuhazOne> yo... i'm trying to get my locales straight in feisty
[02:44] <ferran> how can change /dev/eth2 for /dev/eth1?  i have install ubuntu 7.04 with usb net :(
[02:45] <ikonia_> ferran /etc/interfaces
[02:45] <jrib> rukuartic: you are sure it rebooted?  It didn't just restart X?
[02:45] <theoryx> what is the SU command for ubutu?

[02:45] <ikonia_> theoryx "su" and "sudo"
[02:45] <theoryx> *ubundu
[02:45] <Huffalump> heh
[02:45] <Anssi_> Are the benefits of Feisty upgrade worth the trouble and initial bugs, if you use Linux for work, not for fun...
[02:45] <mlu> ikonia: No smartd running.
[02:45] <JebJoya> put the cd in, then tried gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade" that didn't work, then saw the button in the top right and clicked it, did all the upgrades i could then did the distribution upgrade
[02:45] <finalbeta_> Anyone knows a good screenshot program for gnome? Takes screenshot of individual windows? The standard program is such crap. Reporting bugs on that one seems futile.
[02:45] <jrib> ubuntu: you are here

[02:45] <ferran> ikonia, thanks
[02:45] <ubuntu> woot
[02:45] <SandMan> Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/multiverse/source/Sources.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
[02:46] <ikonia_> mlu no idea then
[02:46] <JuhazOne> i get these errors abouts my locale right now :/ i've set most of the locale vars to fi_FI.ISO-8859-1 like i did in dapper
[02:46] <SandMan> could someone help me please, i get this when i try upgrading "Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/feisty/multiverse/source/Sources.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)"
[02:46] <jrib> finalbeta_: you can use gimp.  But alt + PrintScreen should let you use the default program to do windows
[02:46] <ikonia_> SandMan  I discussed this with you earlier
[02:46] <SandMan> ikonia_ : it wasnt me
[02:46] <LjL> JebJoya: uhm, i don't know about cdromupgrade. i'd try to just follow the standard instructions
[02:46] <magnetron> finalbeta_: you can take screenshots in individual windows using alt+ prinscreen
[02:46] <ikonia_> SandMan and gave you 3 possible issues and fixes
[02:46] <LjL> !upgrade > JebJoya    (JebJoya, see the private message from Ubotu)
[02:46] <ikonia_> SandMan yes it was
[02:46] <ikonia_> you where called "sand_man"
[02:46] <sorcerer> is there a way to run .. par2 files in teh gui in ubuntu ?
[02:47] <theoryx> i can't sudo to change chmod to menu.lst
[02:47] <ubuntu> how long has this thing been up?
[02:47] <theoryx> :(
[02:47] <SandMan> ikonia_ : no it wasnt me seriously man
[02:47] <Hairulfr> ikonia: Lol
[02:47] <LjL> JebJoya: just use update manager. if it doesn't upgrade anything (because it thinks you're already on feisty, which partially you are), i'll give you a fixed sources.list and that should do it
[02:47] <JuhazOne> and another thing... KDE won't let me change resolution to 1600x1200 even though the resolution was correctly set up in xorg.conf. any ideas why?
[02:47] <jrib> theoryx: why would you chmod menu.lst?
[02:47] <theoryx> su doesn't work
[02:47] <ikonia_> SandMan 2 people called sandman asking exactly the same question ?
[02:47] <theoryx> i cant save it
[02:47] <|capiira> join #kubuntu
[02:47] <ferran> ikonia, /etc/interfaces or /etc/network/interfaces ?
[02:47] <|capiira> heh
[02:47] <JuhazOne> #kubuntu... hmmh, could try that
[02:47] <JebJoya> LjL: the reason i used the CD was that wireless wasn't working
[02:47] <ikonia_> ferran /etc/network/interfaces, my mistake
[02:47] <theoryx> it sais i dont have rights to save it..
[02:47] <SandMan> ikonia_ : think of it this way, why would i ask the same q twice in the same place ?
[02:47] <|capiira> forgot /
[02:47] <finalbeta_> jrib: I would have to reboot for that. The default program doesn't even start anymore, I made it lock up. I killed it, don't know what's keeping it from working now. Anyway, I don't want to use the default one. It simply doesn't work ok.
[02:47] <ikonia_> SandMan because people don't listen
[02:47] <jrib> theoryx: you use sudo to run an editor so you can edit it.  Please take a look at the wiki page you were linked to.  For example,  sudo nano -w /boot/grub/menu.lst
[02:48] <ubuntu> jebjoya: have you tried it more then oce?
[02:48] <JebJoya> LjL: (although saying that, I booted and it suddenly started working before my upgrades so god knows what's going on!)
[02:48] <rukuartic> jrib: Yeah it was really weird
[02:48] <theoryx> what is nano?
[02:48] <ikonia_> theoryx a text editor
[02:48] <BrokenLinux> Anyone know of a thunderbird 2.0 deb pkg?
[02:48] <jo_> mlu: what drives do you have? how are they called, sda or hda?
[02:48] <qebab> can anyone tell me where .bashrc is located?
[02:48] <theoryx> ok
[02:48] <ikonia_> BrokenLinux its not been packaged yet

[02:48] <CompuChip> qebab in your home dir I suppose
[02:48] <ikonia_> qebab your home dir
[02:48] <rukuartic> So whats the difference between Beryl, Compiz, and Aiglx?
[02:48] <BrokenLinux> ikonia, ok thanks

[02:48] <jrib> finalbeta_: use gimp then or "import" from the command line
[02:49] <indraveni> Hi, I want to know hw is the Ubuntu Human theme coded to make its as default theme once we install ubutu
[02:49] <Anssi_> theoryx: nano is a simple editor. And you can say "sudo su" to become root if that's easier for you.
[02:49] <ProN00b> how do i remove packages from a repository i added customly ?
[02:49] <jo_> #botsnack
[02:49] <rukuartic> LjL: Aha, #ubuntu-effects
[02:49] <LjL> Anssi_: or "sudo -i", which is preferable, for reasons of elegance if not anything else.
[02:49] <ubuntu> any one know why it wont launch the browser
[02:49] <ikonia_> SandMan possible problems, you are trying to upgrade a package that doesn't exist in fesity, the package that you want in fesity is now called something else, or the package in fesity is broke, or the mirror is down. Solutions, try removing the package before the upgrade, try changing mirrors, try browsing the repo with http and seeing if the package is there
[02:49] <JebJoya> LjL: Like I just did it, and it still won't install
[02:49] <JebJoya> brb
[02:49] <LjL> ProN00b: like all other packages - sudo apt-get remove packagename
[02:49] <kleftisx> im doing upgrade from edgy to feisty and now it asks me  The default action is to keep your current version.
[02:49] <kleftisx> *** login.defs (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N]  ? d
[02:49] <kleftisx>  what to choose?
[02:49] <schizoschaf> hi just updated in feisty from 2.6.20-14 to 2.6.20-15. is it safe to reboot?
[02:50] <LjL> ProN00b: then remove the entire repository from /etc/apt/sources.list, if that's what you want
[02:50] <ProN00b> LjL, yeah, and how do i list all the packages from that source ?
[02:50] <jrib> ubuntu: firefox?  What happens when you type "firefox" in a terminal?
[02:50] <ikonia_> kleftisx do you want to keep your current version
[02:50] <LjL> JebJoya: ok, giving you another sources.list
[02:50] <ikonia_> schizoschaf yes
[02:50] <schizoschaf> thx ikonia
[02:50] <LjL> ProN00b: that's less trivial, hold on
[02:50] <mjg> How do I upgrade to Fiesty from CD-ROM? I don't want to do a network upgrade.
[02:50] <kleftisx> ikonia_ : what you mean to keep my current version? of edgy? no i want to go to feisty
[02:50] <SandMan> ikonia_ : thx man
[02:50] <jrib> !upgrade > mjg    (mjg, see the private message from ubotu)
[02:50] <ikonia_> mjg put the cd in add it to your sources.lst and upgrade
[02:51] <protocol1> would it be wise to re-install a clean copy of wine after installing new video drivers?
[02:51] <ikonia_> kleftisx the current version of t afile
[02:51] <magnetron> mjg: first, you need the alternate cd. see message from ubotu.
[02:51] <ubuntu> life is a test and we are failing
[02:51] <magnetron> !alternate > mjg
[02:51] <kleftisx> ikonia_ : im a kind of n00b can u explain me about this file?
[02:51] <ikonia_> kleftisx what file is it asking about
[02:51] <ferran> ikonia, this is for change configuration ip, dhcp.... i need change eth1 for eth2 and viceversa, or modify all scripts
[02:51] <JebJoya> LjL: you just going to pastebin the sources.list?
[02:52] <ikonia_> ferran hang on
[02:52] <kleftisx> ikonia_ : `/etc/login.defs'
[02:52] <ikonia_> kleftisx just keep it
[02:52] <Huffalump> If anyone would care to jump in on a solution for the wfb module not found after upgrading to Feisty, then I'd appreciate it.  I have thrown in the towel and given up on further progress without help since I'm unable to find a working answer.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2490656
[02:52] <kleftisx> ikonia_ : ok
[02:53] <blackrave> Could someone explain to me what is different from the version optimized for computers with less than 256 MB RAM? Mine has 256 MB RAM, so I'm a but unsure whether to download the alternative or not
[02:53] <LjL> JebJoya: yes. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16552/ - click on "Download as text" to copy and paste it over your previous list. i moved everything to feisty, and i enabled Universe, since it makes little sense to have it disable when you have repos like the Beryl one enabled. after saving the new file, type  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop  in a console
[02:53] <Joseaa> Guys, need help once more. I edited the file xorg.conf, decreased the display resolution, saved and restarted gnome and now my system is stuck again.
[02:53] <LjL> JebJoya: then upgrade
[02:53] <Joseaa> It now shows a message checking battery state

[02:53] <ikonia_> ferret /etc/iftab - sorry
[02:53] <tikka> I am unable to hear anything in my install of ubuntu, the mixer shows 2 defices.. alsa has an nvidia device and oss has a realtec one.. as far as i know it is a realtec audio system. ideas?
[02:53] <jo_> blackrave: its just the same, but the cd runs without graphical blabla
[02:53] <ProN00b> LjL, any clue on how to remove/list the packages from a source yet ?

[02:59] <PirateHead> When I upgraded to Feisty, my sound card stopped working. Additionally, Rhythmbox crashes when I try to play a song. Why might that be?
[03:00] <LjL> jrib, look at that please
[03:00] <QwertyM> TheoMurpse, Your problem fixed?
[03:00] <Huffalump> nice link, jo_ I know a couple people that will benefit from that when I pass it on.
[03:00] <LjL> JebJoya: give it to it... though it shouldn't. had you done  sudo apt-get update  before?
[03:00] <QwertyM> can one use the nvidia-glx-new for the 7600GT ?

[03:01] <Scapy> guys whats the problem WITH THE SMP KERNELS!!!!!
[03:01] <QwertyM> Huffalump, okay,
[03:01] <Scapy> i just lost smp
[03:01] <Scapy> what can i do
[03:01] <ikonia_> Scapy define lost smp
[03:01] <Scapy> ikonia, i had smp running beautiful n all
[03:01] <Huffalump> Scapy, you can start by typing more things in all caps and including even more exclamation marks.
[03:01] <Scapy> after an upgrade i lost it
[03:02] <ikonia_> Scapy what makes you think you've lost it
[03:02] <Scapy> i tried switching back to the old kern
[03:02] <CompuChip> So, let's go install my new Feisty system :)
[03:02] <Scapy> it died
[03:02] <CompuChip> (and hope it doesn't overheat in the process)

[03:02] <ikonia_> Scapy what makes you think you've lost it ?

[03:02] <LjL> jrib: what (if any) would be the expression for actually telling it to search for stuff that comes from an URL with "medibuntu" in it? i can see ~A, ~O, ~s... in this case ~s i guess does the trick, but
[03:02] <jrib> LjL: hmm.. actually aptitude search '~i~Omedibuntu.sos-sts.com'  gives mea  different result
[03:02] <Scapy> and 1 proc is running only
[03:02] <llutz> hi
[03:02] <ikonia_> Scapy is it a dual core box - or a dual cpu box
[03:03] <LjL> jrib: uhm, i've tried "~O.*anotherrepo.*" (since i don't have medibuntu), do the ".*" not work as i expect them to?
[03:03] <Scapy> dual core
[03:03] <PirateHead> When I upgraded to Feisty, my sound card stopped working. Additionally, Rhythmbox crashes when I try to play a song. Why might that be?
[03:03] <JebJoya> LjL: it's downloading from the internet... :S
[03:03] <PirateHead> What diagnostics can I run to test my sound configuration?
[03:03] <QwertyM> os[harsh@harsh-desktop, Linux 2.6.20-15-generic i686] 
[03:03] <ikonia_> Scapy what are you doing to verify that only one core is running
[03:03] <ZeroSystem> hi how can i run ubuntu with x-server off ??
[03:03] <QwertyM> w00ps
[03:03] <PirateHead> How can I tell if there's an error being outputted somewhere?
[03:03] <ikonia_> ZeroSystem change to a run level without X
[03:03] <Scapy> ikonia, /proc/cpuinfo
[03:03] <JebJoya> LjL: why the heck did it ask for the CD then?
[03:03] <Terminus> PirateHead: what sound card do you have? i have an audigy and i just had the same problem.
[03:03] <LjL> JebJoya: yes, it was supposed to do that... well, i don't know. i'm surprised that it has.
[03:03] <Lukemob> Hey all, I got a little probem.
[03:03] <Lukemob> sudo: unable to execute /sbin/shutdown: Input/output error
[03:03] <ikonia_> Scapy and you only see one core ? you have cpu0 not cpu0 and 1
[03:03] <ZeroSystem> how do i change that
[03:03] <PirateHead> I have whatever sound card came in my laptop. Is there an easy way to find out what it is?
[03:03] <Scapy> yes ikonia
[03:04] <jrib> LjL: that should work as well (it does here when I try .*medibuntu.*)
[03:04] <JebJoya> LjL: so why the CD? 8| my PC is posessed
[03:04] <LjL> jrib: uhm then i must just have misspelled something
[03:04] <ikonia_> Scapy thats very strange, where did you get the kernel ?
[03:04] <LjL> JebJoya: *shrug*
[03:04] <Terminus> PirateHead: lspci should give you the model. lsmod|grep $your_sound_card should give you info on whether the driver is loaded or not.
[03:04] <PirateHead> Terminus: What did you have to do to fix the problem?
[03:04] <Scapy> ikonia, from my sources list
[03:04] <Scapy> that i am about to kill
[03:04] <aurel86> i have just installed feisty and the sound is really silent on my realtek alc861, does anybody know how to fix it?
[03:04] <ikonia_> Scapy was it an official ubuntu repo  ?
[03:04] <moonlite> I'm in the need for a really really easy to setup ftp-server. I'd like to start it with a commandline something like this: "ftpd --root /path/to/files/ --port 21 --transfer-ports 6000-6500 --anonymous"
[03:04] <CompuChip> ZeroSystem just type sudo runlevel x with x whatever you want to set it to
[03:05] <CompuChip> I think 3 doesn't have X
[03:05] <moonlite> any suggestions?
[03:05] <Scapy> ikonia, shall i paste bin you my sources list ?
[03:05] <Dekkard> aurel86, have you tried alsamixer?
[03:05] <robin_sz> hi ... im looking for an apache plugin

[03:05] <ikonia_> Scapy no, just tell me if its an official ubuntu repo

[03:05] <Terminus> PirateHead: opened volume control, went to switches, disabled analog/digital output
[03:05] <CompuChip> ZeroSystem I think I just told you nonsense. Sorry :)
[03:05] <JebJoya> gutsy gibbon: variant
[03:05] <JebJoya> variant: i think
[03:05] <PirateHead> Terminus: my lspci has a line that says ATI Techhnologies HDA Audio -- would that be my sound card?
[03:05] <variant> JebJoya: lol
[03:05] <abcde`> ZeroSystem: sudo telinit 3 to start without X. sudo telinit 5 to get X back.
[03:05] <Terminus> PirateHead: sounds like it.

[03:11] <Huffalump> fathefner, you will probably find this information very handy as well -> http://www.debianadmin.com/mount-your-widows-partitions-and-make-it-readwritable-in-ubuntu.html
[03:11] <PirateHead> okay, got it.  http://pastebin.ca/449781

[03:14] <PirateHead> crimsun: that's great. Next kernel upload could be awhile though, rihgt?
[03:14] <Huffalump> Failed to load module wfb.  Anyone?
[03:14] <Dekkard> aur86 do you have any sound at all?
[03:14] <crimsun> PirateHead: it could be, sure.
[03:14] <Huffalump> ProN00b, use se.archive...
[03:14] <ProN00b> se
[03:14] <ProN00b> k
[03:14] <kippi> Slart: where can I find this app-file?
[03:14] <rohan> why doesnt ubuntu configure synaptics touchpad automatically ? like it did in breezy ?
[03:14] <Slart> !apt-file
[03:14] <ubotu> apt-file is a program that can tell you which package(s) contain(s) a given filename. To install it and generate the database it needs, run "sudo apt-get install apt-file && sudo apt-file update"
[03:14] <variant> rohan: it does.. mine works
[03:14] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: will the mplayer plugin automatically kick in when I uninstall the totem plugin?
[03:15] <rohan> variant: by default out of box ?
[03:15] <Slart> !apt-file | kippi
[03:15] <Jowi> !info libmotion0
[03:15] <robinlinth> on Edgy, Beryl was not safe. But, is it safe on Feisty?
[03:15] <variant> rohan: yeah.. i used the live cd and it worked
[03:15] <tokyoahead> hi all... I just booted ubuntu 7.04 from CDrom, is there a way to switch the resultion to a custom value? I have 1280x800....
[03:15] <Slart> bah.. look at ubotu's answer, kippi
[03:15] <Huffalump> robinlinth, yes it is.  please join #ubuntu-effects
[03:15] <Dekkard> CheesyJedi,  it did on my system... totem was giving me fits.. i installed mplayer plugin.. and untill i uninstalled the totme plugin it wouldnt work
[03:15] <ubotu> kippi: apt-file is a program that can tell you which package(s) contain(s) a given filename. To install it and generate the database it needs, run "sudo apt-get install apt-file && sudo apt-file update"
[03:15] <variant> rohan: my gf uses it on edgy and it is perfectly stable
[03:15] <ubotu> Package libmotion0 does not exist in feisty
[03:15] <robinlinth> Huffalump, thanks for the channel.
[03:15] <Scapy> ikonia, meh its not listed in the bug section
[03:15] <rohan> variant: great .. here it's detected as some wacom stuff
[03:15] <variant> robinlinth: my gf uses it on edgy and it is perfectly stable
[03:16] <variant> rohan: odd
[03:16] <auridius> magnetron: Okay, this works.....thx
[03:16] <rohan> variant: odd indeed
[03:17] <robertj> btw if anyone needs a quick mirror http://linuxserv.uga.edu/linux/ubuntu-iso/7.04/ is probably totally unnoticed
[03:17] <arch_> how do you update your kernel (and is it a good idea to do so?)?
[03:17] <aurel86> dekkard, yes there is a sound but silent, i have changed from edgy, there was no problem
[03:17] <robertj> its unofficial, unlisted, and sitting on a really fat pipe
[03:17] <Dekkard> aurel86,  i feel ya
[03:17] <crimsun> aurel86: I'm waiting for output that I requested. Do you have it ready?
[03:17] <Dekkard> have you tried using oss instead of alsa?
[03:18] <BrokenLinux> !dock
[03:18] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about dock - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[03:18] <Dekkard> and if this is a lappie, is there a way of manually changing volume on it?
[03:18] <rohan> also, in snd-hda-intel drivers, the "Surround" channel on my laptop is muted, so no sound by default, unless i manually add channels and increase their volume. is that expected ? this same setup worked on edgy
[03:18] <robertj> 30 megs a secondish
[03:18] <crimsun> rohan: depends on the HDA codec you have. please read http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=support and tell me the URL of the paste generated by the script linked from that page.
[03:19] <rohan> crimsun: sure
[03:19] <kleftisx> i have download the upgrades for feisty...how i insstall them now?
[03:19] <ltk> !info feisty hdparm

[03:19] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about hdparm - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[03:20] <Ayabara> Can I use vpnc with the vpn profile I have for the Cisco client?
[03:20] <ltk> crimsun, and then hdparm can use the /dev/sdXX devices? that would be nice!

[03:20] <ltk> ah,ok.
[03:20] <Masqy> Hi all, Which program is recommended in order to establish a video conference between an ubuntu machine and a winxp one? Does Skype support this feature?
[03:20] <JebJoya> !fr
[03:20] <Pelo> !fr | grumz
[03:20] <rohan> Masqy: skype doesnt
[03:20] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: I uninstalled totem and restarted firefox, it's still not working. it displays video as black boxes that say: no video in white
[03:21] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[03:21] <ubotu> grumz: please see above
[03:21] <CompuChip> Wow, the migration assistant in 7.04 is cool
[03:21] <Dekkard> CheesyJedi,  give me the url.
[03:21] <magnetron> auridius: great
[03:21] <grumz> ok thx ubotu
[03:21] <Dekkard>  it could be you need to install bunches of codecs
[03:21] <glatzor> leongoo: as the name already intends the package contains the core parts of update-manager that are used by its different frontends
[03:21] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: okay, but it's like that with all wuicktime (not just this url)
[03:21] <Dekkard> ok
[03:21] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: http://www.gametrailers.com/player.php?type=mov&id=18674
[03:21] <grumz> bye
[03:21] <JebJoya> is there a lojban room for ubuntu? :)
[03:21] <kleftisx> i have download the upgrades for feisty...how i install them now?
[03:21] <ProN00b> why can't package managers use a more stalinistic approach to package management ? (as in everything not in a package and not in a users folder will get flagged)
[03:21] <rohan> should i file a bug for the synaptics touchpad not automatically being detected issue ?
[03:22] <giddion55> hove come this is the most popular channel on the server?
[03:22] <PriceChild> kleftisx, sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get upgrade, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[03:22] <Huffalump> Masqy, I think you want to look into GnomeMeeting
[03:22] <giddion55> is unbuto good?
[03:22] <zaggynl> giddion55, because, ubuntu is getting quite a bit of attention.
[03:22] <PriceChild> kleftisx, those 3 commands will make sure your system is completely up to date
[03:22] <giddion55> zaggnl:  why though
[03:22] <magnetron> !feisty | giddion55
[03:22] <ubotu> giddion55: FEISTY IS OUT! Party in #ubuntu-release-party - Torrent downloads at http://us.releases.ubuntu.com/7.04/ - Metalinks (use with Aria2 or, under Windows, GetRight) at http://download.packages.ro/metalink/ubuntu/
[03:22] <Huffalump> giddion55, no it's terrible!  However, Ubuntu is pretty good.
[03:22] <ProN00b> ubuntu: debian for niggers !
[03:23] <kleftisx> PriceChild : ok thx
[03:23] <jrib> giddion55: a lot of us think so, why don't you try out a Desktop CD (live cd) and see if you like it?
[03:23] <leongoo> glatzor: but it seems it's not needed to upgrade to feisty, odd
[03:23] <Huffalump> ProN00b, knock that off.
[03:23] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: any ideas?
[03:23] <PirateHead> crimsun: still there? I downloaded your new .ko files and rebooted, but I still don't have sound.
[03:23] <ZeroSystem> how can i log in as a root ?
[03:23] <Tom47> giddion55 are you a linux user?
[03:23] <CompuChip> ZeroSystem you don't wanna do that
[03:23] <PriceChild> !sudo > ZeroSystem (see pm from ubotu
[03:23] <CompuChip> ZeroSystem use sudo -i instead
[03:23] <giddion55> jrib: well im using suse at the moment,  and ive used gentoo before,  how different is unbuto?
[03:23] <PriceChild> CompuChip, no need for sudo -i
[03:23] <Stranger> ZeroSystem sudo bash
[03:23] <Masqy> Huffalump: Does it have a Windows counterpart?
[03:24] <giddion55> tom47: in a way yes mate
[03:24] <Toshibi> Has anyone else had problems with the partitioner?
[03:24] <Chipaca> hi all
[03:24] <CompuChip> PriceChild depends on what you want to do :)
[03:24] <PriceChild> CompuChip, if you can't use sudo on a command and it requires a full root terminal then the app is broken
[03:24] <southafrikanse> hello I need help about Ubuntu
[03:24] <lungan> nawk: error while loading shared libraries: libm.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[03:24] <jrib> !ask | southafrikanse
[03:24] <ubotu> southafrikanse: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[03:24] <crimsun> PirateHead: can you rerun that script using --with-all ?
[03:24] <JebJoya> southafrikanse: ask away
[03:24] <lungan> nawk: error while loading shared libraries: libm.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[03:24] <CompuChip> PriceChild when I'm tweaking settings and have to edit a config file and restart a service all the time, I use sudo -i
[03:24] <Huffalump> Masqy, it works with NetMeeting
[03:24] <Pelo> southafrikanse,  just ask
[03:24] <Toshibi> I've been trying to install all morning...
[03:24] <lungan> where do i download them?
[03:24] <rohan> crimsun: the script is hung at "uploading to pastebin.ca" and on that page, i can't find any way to prevent it from doing it
[03:24] <PriceChild> CompuChip, not recommended :)
[03:24] <CheesyJedi> how do I get the mplayer plugin for firefox working? synaptic says that it's installed but when I try to play a quicktime video it comes up in a black box and in white it says: (no video)
[03:24] <PirateHead> crimsun: the alsa-info script?
[03:24] <Chipaca> is there an alternate torrent file? the one I donwloaded yesterday is using a tracker that seems to be way too busy (and I'm at 97%!)
[03:25] <crimsun> PirateHead: yes
[03:25] <Masqy> Huffalump: This is the default microsoftish application for video conference?
[03:25] <CompuChip> PriceChild better than passwd root :) But why not?
[03:25] <Dekkard> hmm
[03:25] <Dekkard> it seems these are flash vids
[03:25] <southafrikanse> I have no sound on UBuntu. I just installed the latest version and aparently its not supported
[03:25] <Dekkard> not quicktime
[03:25] <crimsun> rohan: then just pastebin the output from ``lspci -vvn && cat /proc/asound/card0/codec*`
[03:25] <PriceChild> CompuChip, because using sudo _makes_ you think.... "does this really need sudo?"
[03:25] <southafrikanse> HOw can I get sound?
[03:25] <crimsun> rohan: (with proper shell quoting, of course)
[03:25] <PriceChild> CompuChip, so that you don't just go round randomly typing commands
[03:25] <Huffalump> Masqy, technically GnomeMeeting works with all the standards-compliant video chat tools... including Microsoft's NetMeeting (which is default on Windows, yes)
[03:25] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: it's quicktime (on apple's trailer site I get the same error)
[03:25] <moonlite> ikonia: do you know of any ftpd that takes a little less time to configure than vsftpd. It didn't quite live up to my expectations of having anonymous ftp up in 5 minutes. :/
[03:26] <crimsun> southafrikanse: what's the output from ``tail -2 /proc/asound/oss/sndstat'' ?
[03:26] <PirateHead>  http://pastebin.ca/449801
[03:26] <Toshibi> I'm having problems with the partitioner...and I've been trying to install all morning...
[03:26] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: flash works fine for me
[03:26] <southafrikanse> Sorry but I'm a noob on Ubuntu
[03:26] <Masqy> Huffalump: Thanks!
[03:26] <CheesyJedi> how do I get the mplayer plugin for firefox working? synaptic says that it's installed but when I try to play a quicktime video it comes up in a black box and in white it says: (no video)
[03:26] <Dekkard> wierd.. cause Im watching the Wiicast right now.. and it seems to be flash
[03:26] <Pelo> southafrikanse,  first play around with alsa mixier a bit make sure nothing in muted,  if it 's a no go . look up your soundcard or chipset in the forum
[03:26] <southafrikanse> I have to put that on the console?
[03:26] <PirateHead> SouthAfrikanse: I'm having the same problem. I upgraded and now have no sound.
[03:26] <lungan> nawk: error while loading shared libraries: libm.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[03:26] <CheesyJedi> Dekkard: well...not for me
[03:26] <Pelo> CheesyJedi,  remoe totem-mozilla it interfeers
[03:27] <Pelo> remove
[03:27] <Dekkard> dats what i said!
[03:27] <CheesyJedi> Pelo: I did
[03:27] <Toshibi> It will get most of the way through, mount the hard drive, and then fail...saying "Can not create ext3 filesystem on sda1"
[03:27] <CheesyJedi> Pelo: it didn't help
[03:27] <crimsun> southafrikanse: yes, then tell me the output
[03:27] <Pelo> CheesyJedi,  do you have the codecs installed ?
[03:27] <Toshibi> But it will work in qtparted...
[03:27] <rohan> crimsun: http://rafb.net/p/L934O816.html
[03:27] <crimsun> PirateHead: you likely need model=auto, too, though your codec info is cut off
[03:27] <CheesyJedi> Pelo: I think so, but how do I check?
[03:28] <Pelo> !codecs > CheesyJedi   check your pm
[03:28] <Bug2000> How do I make sda a fat device?
[03:28] <southafrikanse> <crimsun>: It says 0: Realtek ALC880
[03:28] <rohan> this codec of snd-hda-intel is bad :( it doesnt automatically mute the laptop speakers when i put in a headphone in the socket
[03:28] <balchd> Hi. I've just installed 7.04, which went nice and smoothly :-) However, Restricted Drivers Manager won't enable my NV18GL [Quadro FX 550]  when I ask it. Where should I look to fix it?
[03:28] <PirateHead> so, run the script again like "bash alsa-info --with-all model=auto"?
[03:28] <Chipaca> rohan: snd-hda-intel sucks :(
[03:28] <xopey_> good grief; servers are slammed!
[03:28] <rohan> Chipaca: i agree :(
[03:28] <MaximusBrood> I'm trying to forward a port for uTorrent. This is TCP 38806. I already tried a few times using iptables, but it never worked. Could someone please guide me through it or redirect me to a good guide? The connection is set up like this: DSL (ppp0) -> Xubuntu Server -> Other computer
[03:28] <crimsun> PirateHead: no, modprobe -r snd-hda-intel && modprobe snd-hda-intel model=auto
[03:29] <rohan> crimsun: that's ok, or you need output of some other command too ? :)
[03:29] <zaggynl> MaximusBrood, sudo firestarter
[03:29] <doolph> hi
[03:29] <crimsun> rohan: I'm very busy; please be patient.
[03:29] <Chipaca> rohan: I finally got mine working decently with 2.6.19 -- I don't know what feisty brings
[03:29] <zaggynl> MaximusBrood, and if it isn't installed, install firestarter first :P
[03:29] <aa^way> how to end procress? im programming but i forgot add to Xbutton and seems like i cant close it lol
[03:29] <MaximusBrood> zaggynl: That sounded too easy to be true, trying now :)
[03:29] <Chipaca> rohan: "decently" still doesn't include a mic, unfortunately
[03:29] <PirateHead> crimsun: FATAL: Module snd_hda_intel is in use.
[03:29] <magnetron> !firewall > MaximusBrood
[03:29] <PirateHead> crimsun: do I need to run as root?
[03:29] <rohan> crimsun: sorry, no problem
[03:29] <CompuChip> aa^way you can use killall to send an appropriate signal
[03:30] <crimsun> PirateHead: no, close whatever's using the sound device (likely the mixer applet in the panel)
[03:30] <xopey_> MaximusBrood, have you tried an iptables wrapper like shorewall
[03:30] <aa^way> CompuChip doesnt it kill all programs, isnt there any other way, i got important procresses opened what shouldnt be closed
[03:30] <xopey_> it's really light-weight
[03:30] <JebJoya> what's the package i need for mp3 playback?
[03:30] <leongoo> /bye
[03:30] <Pici> !mp3 | JebJoya
[03:30] <crimsun> rohan: known issue, upstream is broken.  modprobe -r snd-hda-intel && modprobe snd-hda-intel model=auto
[03:30] <ubotu> JebJoya: For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[03:30] <MaximusBrood> xopey_: No, I've only tried to do it with raw iptables
[03:30] <PirateHead> crimsun: right click the sound mixer thing and hit "remove from panel"?
[03:30] <stefg> JebJoya: depends on the ubuntu-version you are on
[03:31] <southafrikanse> Crimsun: did you forget me?
[03:31] <crimsun> PirateHead: or just pkill mixer_applet
[03:31] <aurel86> crimsun:  here is the link http://pastebin.ca/449797
[03:31] <MaximusBrood> xopey_: Do you think shorewall is better than firestarter for my cause?
[03:31] <rohan> crimsun: ah, ok .. thanks
[03:31] <BrokenLinux> Anyone know if there is a dock (like ksmoothdock) for gnome?
[03:31] <Chipaca> PirateHead: as root, fuser -v /dev/snd/*
[03:31] <xopey_> MaximusBrood: i've not tried (or heard of) firestarter
[03:31] <rohan> Chipaca: you got that working, when you put a headphone, laptop speakers stop /
[03:31] <stefg> BrokenLinux: Nothing taht you'll want
[03:31] <phatrabbit> Hi all when i type sudo apt-get install ssh i get the following error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16558/
[03:31] <Dekkard> BrokenLinux,  try gdesklets
[03:31] <PirateHead> Chipaca: what does that do?
[03:31] <Chipaca> PirateHead: if nothing seems essential, you can use fuser -k :)
[03:31] <xopey_> shorewall has good support MaximusBrood
[03:31] <phatrabbit> can somone explain to me what i need to do http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16558/
[03:31] <Chipaca> PirateHead: -v lists the processes using those files
[03:31] <MaximusBrood> Then I'll try that, thanks.
[03:31] <wickedpuppy> xopey_, firestarter is an excellent gui front-end for iptables :P
[03:31] <BrokenLinux> thanks
[03:31] <Chipaca> PirateHead: -k kills em
[03:32] <Chipaca> rohan: yes
[03:32] <xopey_> nice, wickedpuppy . i'll check that out too
[03:32] <rohan> Chipaca: GREAT .. please guide me too
[03:32] <PirateHead> crimsun: I ran the modprobes.,
[03:32] <crimsun> southafrikanse: please read http://www.linux-sound.info/alsa/index.php?task=support and tell me the URL of the paste generated by the script linked from that page.
[03:32] <PirateHead> crimsun: should that fix sound?
[03:32] <DVS01> i want to provide a shell usable only for scp and sftp. it will be used for mounting my fileserver's contents over the internet. what shell should i use, rssh or scponly?
[03:32] <Huffalump> BrokenLinux - http://www.gnome-dock.org/
[03:32] <xopey_> i haven't figured out how to get my vpn to work with my iptables config, so i may give it a try wickedpuppy
[03:32] <Chipaca> rohan: I compiled my own kernel :(
[03:32] <rohan> also, the mute key - Fn-F8 is not working. is it due to the same issue, crimsun ?
[03:32] <wickedpuppy> xopey_, pls do ...
[03:32] <crimsun> rohan: unrelated.
[03:32] <rohan> Chipaca: but how did it help the issue ?
[03:32] <atomiku> Hello im having a bit of trouble booting ubuntu 7, when the splash screen and progress bar comes up the progress bar gets stuck on 1-2%
[03:33] <CheesyJedi> Pelo: you know what, scratch that. Is there an easy way to get the VLC plugin for firefox working? (That already has all the plugins built in). synaptic says that it's installed, so how do I enable it?
[03:33] <noiesmo> phatrabbit, have you tried sudo apt-get install -f
[03:33] <oxygen> i cant remove apache2
[03:33] <ferronica> before burning DVD RW DATA need to be format
[03:33] <xopey_> wickedpuppy: have you gotten vpn working through it?
[03:33] <oxygen> help me pls
[03:33] <Chipaca> rohan: the driver in 2.6.19 was fixed enough that it worked
[03:33] <rashid> anyone know how to install java in fiesty?
[03:33] <crimsun> PirateHead: you need to tell me; I can't read your mind
[03:33] <phatrabbit> not yet what will that do
[03:33] <rohan> Chipaca: what changes did you make in the kernel ?
[03:33] <crimsun> rashid: 1.5 or 1.6?
[03:33] <rashid> its 1.6
[03:33] <PirateHead> crimsun: I mean, is it supposed to fix the sound? =D
[03:33] <Dekkard> !java | rashid
[03:33] <ubotu> rashid: To install a Java compiler/interpreter on Ubuntu, look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java - For the Sun Java runtime install sun-java5-jre from the !Multiverse repository. Enable the backports repository on Edgy to install sun-java6-jre
[03:33] <wickedpuppy> xopey_, through the iptables ? nope but ssh yes
[03:33] <rohan> Chipaca: ok. well i've tried and it doesnt work out of box on arch and ubuntu default kernels
[03:33] <oxygen> http://rafb.net/p/g7xDRi46.html
[03:33] <ZeroSystem> for some reason the command runlevel 3 says unknown
[03:33] <phatrabbit> i get a similar error when i type sudo apt-get install -f

[03:34] <Chipaca> rohan: yes
[03:34] <rohan> Chipaca: yes
[03:34] <southafrikanse> SHould I press the last link or install the script?
[03:34] <crimsun> PirateHead: ok, did you reboot after erasing the old modules and downloading the new ones?
[03:34] <atomiku> PirateHead: i did.
[03:34] <scarabatwork> i have a problem on my system.  when ever i try to open synaptic i get the error: The underlying authorization mechanism (sudo) does not allow you to run this program"  any clues?

[03:34] <joeljkp> is there a way to tell apt to permanently ignore a package's dependency?
[03:34] <PirateHead> crimsun: if by modules you mean .ko files, yes.
[03:34] <moDumass> hey all, i just came home from a night out and my machine had frozen, is there any log or something i can use to 'backtrace' what caused this?

[03:35] <noelferreira> i can't open a local html file with firefox. (file not found) anyone knows why?
[03:35] <ferronica> Some filenames need to be shortened due to the 64 char restriction of the Joliet extensions. Continue anyway?
[03:35] <atomiku> that means i gotta reboot, see what the error is in failsafe, then- hang on, failsafe?
[03:35] <atomiku> PirateHead: What failsafe ?
[03:35] <Chipaca> moDumass: your machine felt left out. Next time, take it with you!
[03:35] <Chipaca> moDumass: :)

[03:35] <orbin> lungan: right-click > prefs
[03:35] <ferronica> what it dose mean?
[03:35] <rohan> do i also need to update my .ko files with the ones given in that bug report ?
[03:35] <PirateHead> atomiku: I think it's called "failsafe GNOME" or something.
[03:35] <BrokenLinux> Huffalump, you can't actually install gnome-dock yet though right?
[03:35] <atomiku> no
[03:35] <moDumass> chipara but then id have to unplug the lan cable and it would be all alone
[03:35] <atomiku> thats when ubuntu is already booted
[03:35] <atomiku> ubuntu isnt actually booting
[03:35] <orbin> noelferreira: how are you opening it?
[03:35] <atomiku> it gets stuck on 1%
[03:35] <XBehave> moDumass: try dmesg | tail i think that might have some info but im not sure
[03:36] <Chipaca> gotta go
[03:36] <crimsun> PirateHead: err, wait, the fix that I made is incomplete. Please hang a sec; I need to recompile them.
[03:36] <andy_> does anyone have aiglx+netbeans+gnome running? When I start netbeans, I get the license agreement without buttons or content. It's actually following bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xgl/+bug/48404 . The problem is, I'm using aiglx.

[03:37] <jijutm> i think my apt database is corrupt.. how can I do a full reload
[03:43] <omega> um if its that bad then u might not be able to'
[03:43] <Pelo> CheesyJedi,  lovely ;-),  I don'T know if  vlc supports quicktime but whatever,    what version of ubu are you running ?
[03:43] <southafrikanse> Crimsun: What should I install? ALSA Info? AMixer-Info or Reload-ALSA?
[03:43] <PirateHead> jijutm: first, make a backup of your corrupted database so the apt team can look at it. It might be useful in debugging apt?
[03:43] <crimsun> southafrikanse: I need the output from `bash alsa-info.sh --with-all`
[03:43] <jijutm> might be..
[03:43] <finn> how can I detect/find out  the name of a hard drive which was not detected during installation?

[03:43] <jijutm> priatehead: how can I do this..
[03:43] <XBehave> moDumass: either one of those caused it to crash or dmes isnt the right place to look, i dont know which is right im fairly new to ubuntu
[03:43] <bullgard4> I have installed irssi-plugin-icq. How to setup now an ICQ connection in irssi?
[03:43] <PirateHead> jijutm: I don't know. If I were going to try and find out, I'd start by reading the apt man pages.
[03:43] <jijutm> ok
[03:43] <noelferreira> i can't open a local html file with firefox. (file not found) anyone knows why?
[03:43] <jijutm> thanks..

[03:43] <PirateHead> jijutm: good luck. Sucks that apt quit working.
[03:43] <Pelo> CheesyJedi,   chouldn'T be that hard in edgy,  remove mplayer, remove vlc,  the pluggins will be removed as well,  then install the mplayer-mozilla pluggin
[03:43] <aurel86> crimsun: have you done sth with that output?
[03:43] <crimsun> aurel86: please be patient; you're not the only one being assisted
[03:43] <Masqy> How come I don't have an option to upgrade to Fawn in the update manager? (I use Edgy).
[03:43] <Huffalump> BrokenLinux, sure you can.  http://www.gnome-dock.org/trac/browser

[03:43] <[miles] > nice eh
[03:43] <[miles] > :)
[03:43] <CheesyJedi> Pelo: btw, I have a question about that. when I upgrade to edgy, is it going to need a complete new install or does it retain the files and just update the appropriate files?
[03:43] <PirateHead> Masqy: do you have the latest version of the update manager?
[03:43] <noiesmo> phatrabbit, did you upgrade recently or remove samba
[03:43] <CheesyJedi> Pelo: *Upgrade to feisty

[03:43] <crimsun> aurel86: modprobe -r snd-hda-intel && modprobe snd-hda-intel model=auto
[03:43] <PirateHead> Masqy: hit check for updates, enter your password, and wait for it to check.
[03:43] <rohan> crimsun: that command fails because snd-hda-intel is in use. what do i do ? close all sound apps ?
[03:43] <PirateHead> rohan: yes.
[03:43] <Masqy> Pelo: I did, first it updated couple of applications, now it shows nothing.

[03:43] <mc44> Masqy: close it and run it again
[03:43] <crimsun> [miles] : a bug # would help.

[03:43] <southafrikanse> HOw can I install it?
[03:43] <Pelo> Masqy,  I sent you some instructions, they should have opened up an extra chat window in your client

[03:43] <Masqy> Pelo: thanks, they did.
[03:43] <crimsun> [miles] : no, I'm not the kernel lead. It's not my decision.
[03:43] <noiesmo> phatrabbit, well you could try to install samba as that what it complains about sudo aptitude install samba
[03:43] <[miles] > crimsun: ok, well, I'll just roll on with my mods :-)

[03:46] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

[03:51] <ikonia_> parking- no as, I said ntfs is read only
[03:51] <rohan> PirateHead: that might help
[03:51] <Xteven> ikonia_: hmm ok

[03:58] <DeadCowboy> hi friends!, I just installed Feisty (fresh install since I didn't have patience to wait for apt to be stable again)... now I got everything running except my wireless (broadcom) I blacklisted BCM43xx then installed ndiswrapper and used it to install the 64bit version of my bcmwl5.inf... now i see the networks and when i try to connect it detects the right security and EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE it's working perfect but as soon as I c
[03:58] <DeadCowboy> lick the connect button... the connection doesn't connect, it goes back to my wired connection right away without any error messages or whatever
[03:58] <Michaelx> pibernas: Maybe the same would work with my ATI ?
[03:58] <JebJoya> right, i installed the restricted ati drivers from the nice little loader, rebooted, and now if i try desktop effects i get "The Composite extension is not available" - any ideas?

[03:59] <crimsun> aurel86: you need to prepend sudo
[03:59] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, You want to have two connections at the same time?
[03:59] <ikonia_> JebJoya you may get better support in #ubuntu-effects

[03:59] <annihilus> hve two availabe and choose from one or the other
[03:59] <geoffk> webmin has their own deb packages on their site
[03:59] <Tom47> southafrikanse: tell crimsun
[03:59] <DeadCowboy> johnnybuoy... no it just doesn't connect to the wireless (I also tried disabling my wired)
[03:59] <skinnyc> hi all...can someone help...trying to install 7.04 on a HP nx9420 with x1600 ATI...get XServer error while booting !
[03:59] <Michaelx> All: Someone got a notebook with X1600 and 7.04 up and running ?
[04:00] <Kleevah> Are there any IRC clients for linux that looks like hydrairc?
[04:00] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, did you try unplugging the wire from the NIC and then trying to connect to wireless?
[04:00] <annihilus> i get the same xServer error
[04:00] <southafrikanse> Tom47: OK. Thank you for your help
[04:00] <Tom47> southafrikanse: thats all i can help you with for the moment ok
[04:00] <skinnyc> any workarounds ?
[04:00] <imon9> annilus: user wifi-radar for setting up wifi profile
[04:00] <DeadCowboy> johnnybuoy, I tried unplugging the wire AND disabling the nic
[04:00] <southafrikanse> Crimsun: Here is the link: http://pastebin.ca/449836 to see what could be the problem
[04:00] <johnnybuoy> hmmm

[04:01] <aurel86> crimsun: i did it, now it works, thank you
[04:01] <umbrella> quit
[04:01] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, so it shows then networks but it can't associate, or it shows the networks, associates and doesn't get an IP?
[04:01] <imon9> annilus: if your wifi works as auto-connect/auto-configure type, then i would recommend WICD (search it in ubuntu forums,k?)
[04:01] <_dennis_> i'm resizing my partitions, so i went to winXP and changed the partition from 50 to 40, so i have 10giga free space, I want to allocate this in kubuntu (type ext 3), but i can't add the free space (i'm right now in kubuntu, using qtparted)..so what do i have to do, change the type of my 10giga free?
[04:01] <skinnyc> michaelX: I wish I could get that far...wont even boot to desktop !
[04:01] <Michaelx> I mean that I CAN'T get it running :(
[04:01] <Masqy> I think I messed with my sources.list..
[04:01] <Tom47> southafrikanse: as you have prob noticed he is in heavy demand pls be patient everyone here is a volunteer
[04:02] <Masqy> Can someone paste me his in private?
[04:02] <annihilus> imon9: ist there a way of doing it in networking under administration
[04:02] <Michaelx> 7.04 is working (as you can see) but no chance with compiz or Beryl :)
[04:02] <DeadCowboy> johnnybuoy, something like that... it asks for my WPA password and then i put it in... it tries to connect but doesn't and doesn't give an IP... i tried to switch my router to WEP or even NO security... everything failed
[04:02] <skinnyc> oh ok....but you can at least boot off  the CD ?
[04:02] <southafrikanse> Tom47: I understand. I'm just waiting. There's no problem. I'm a patient guy

[04:02] <kleftisx> y Beryl is not working under feisty?
[04:02] <skinnyc> wierd becuase 610 had no problems at all !
[04:02] <PirateHead> crimsun: the change somehow made things worse. Rather than having a recognized sound card that inexplicably doesn't play sound, now it swears that there is no sound device.
[04:03] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, do you have a 64bit version of feisty?
[04:03] <Bsims> ie on upgrade
[04:03] <PirateHead> crimsun: another really strange thing: my computer just beeped at me. It says there's no sound card, but there was a beep just now.
[04:03] <orbin> _dennis_: you can't make a partition out of the free space?
[04:03] <imon9> annihilus: under administration, there is a network-manager by default.... it has its wifi setting too..but just the common one..u can try take a look
[04:03] <lungan> How do i add a third workspace in feisty?
[04:03] <Michaelx> So anyone in here with a Notebook, equipped with an X1600 from ATI who is able to run Beryl or compiz with 7.04 ??? I guess not :(
=== dizz` is now known as dizz

[04:03] <mc44> lungan: right click on the workspaces bit and then properties
[04:03] <PirateHead> Are you there, crimsun? this is bizairre. I just got a popup warning, along with another beep, that says "Cannot eject volume!"
[04:04] <skinnyc> or anyone that can even get 7.04 to boot on an HPnx9420 with X1600 ?
[04:04] <crimsun> PirateHead: can you reboot and pastebin the fresh dmesg ?
[04:04] <PirateHead> Okay, you're there. =D
[04:04] <PirateHead> crimsun: I will do. 1 sec.
[04:04] <lungan> And how do i remove borders from some windows if its possible?
[04:04] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, does the bcm43xx driver not work? did you try it?
[04:04] <crimsun> southafrikanse: what's the make & model of the computer? How are the audio jacks physically laid out on the front/back, if appropriate?
[04:04] <FeistyUbuntu> Is there any good reason as to why one should upgrade from Edgy to Feisty?

[04:05] <surviver> anyone has some expirience with devilspie?
[04:05] <DeadCowboy> johnnybuoy bcm43xx doesn't work for anyone with my model :P
[04:05] <mjr> Michaelx, yes, x850, with free drivers
[04:05] <not_a_k> i wish apt and update-manager could use bit torrent
[04:05] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, ah!
[04:06] <ikonia_> Michaelx let me make this easy for you. Many people have got it working, but the ATI cards are a pain to support so most people have to go through a world of pain and read all the documentation
[04:06] <southafrikanse> crimsun: It is a LG NOtebook model: P1 5005P with audio jacks on the right of the notebook
[04:06] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, can you paste the lspci line of the wireless card?
[04:06] <magnetron> Michaelx: you have to use the alternate cd: http://www.mikesplanet.net/2007/04/installing-ubuntu-704-ati-x-cards/
[04:06] <mjr> >=x1300 ATIs are the ones that are a pain

[04:10] <Bsims> ikonia_: I know that part was wondering about package breakage
[04:10] <rohan> crimsun: :)
[04:10] <crimsun> southafrikanse: did you re-execute the modprobe commands?
[04:10] <syngin087> this channell is to busy
[04:10] <ikonia_> Bsims research it then
[04:10] <sorcerer> escapr chars or quotes ?? where do insert them .. between what parts the whole file name
[04:10] <ikonia_> syngin087 too busy
[04:10] <PirateHead> Crimsun: you asked for a fresh dmesg, but I don't know how to get it to you. It's larger than the output buffer, so I can't copy and paste it.
[04:10] <chm0d> I dunno if they ever worked Ive never had to worry bout proxy
[04:10] <deepsa> git://git.beryl-project.org/beryl/component how i get these?
[04:10] <CompuChip> Sounds like I better downgrade to Edgy for a while
[04:10] <syngin087> yes
[04:10] <rohan> the worst part is that this sound problem is a regression from edgy, where it worked perfectly :(
[04:10] <southafrikanse> crimsun: Yes
[04:10] <PirateHead> crimsun: is there a way to output dmesg to a file?
[04:10] <M0K3R> Hey, i've installed feisty but have problems with installing the nVidia drivers now
[04:10] <rohan> PirateHead: dmesg > file_foo
[04:11] <finn> !nvidi
[04:11] <finn> !nvidia
[04:11] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about nvidi - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:11] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[04:11] <CompuChip> This new version is nice to play with but it still has some... deficiencies?
[04:11] <nox-Hand> My Ubuntu has not booted the kernels from -14 and up (-14 and -15). They both boot into busybox. -13 works but due to too new nvidia driver I have no X and I don't want to fix that, I want to boot -15 kernel (the newest). I need help!:-/
[04:11] <kleftisx> magnetron : as i say i have already install beryl before in edgy and now gets the updates for beryl and everything but it not working
[04:11] <ikonia_> sorcerer Chill\ Out or "Chill Out"
[04:11] <crimsun> rohan: I know, man, I know.
[04:11] <sorcerer> ok let me try mate
[04:11] <DeadCowboy> johnnybuoy it says Follow these steps to get your wireless card working under ubuntu dapper 6.06:
[04:11] <M0K3R> ubotu: i've done that all
[04:11] <mc44> nox-Hand: you have updated to the latest -15 kernel?
[04:11] <_dennis_> orbin: i made one, how can i upload it, i probably can't use pastebin for this
[04:11] <crimsun> rohan: I'm working as fast as I can to fix them all, but seeing how I do this in my oh-so-copious free time...
[04:11] <FeistyUbuntu> Cuz I need to convince a friend to upgrade, but I don't know what to tell him. He feels Edgy is good enough.
[04:11] <M0K3R> ubotu: i come from a forum where they can't help me anymore :)
[04:11] <ikonia_> FeistyUbuntu then don't convince him
[04:12] <FeistyUbuntu> hmmm.
[04:12] <magnetron> kleftisx; you need beryl for feisty, not sam as beryl for edgy

[04:12] <crimsun> southafrikanse: is `aplay /usr/share/sounds/*up.wav` audible?
[04:12] <DeadCowboy> and johnnybuoy I have just a out of topic question... is your nickname referring to some kind of quebec's stupid video series?
[04:12] <deepsa> git://git.beryl-project.org/beryl/component how i download code from here"?
[04:12] <FeistyUbuntu> he's still asking me if there's much of a difference...
[04:12] <Angel-SL> !cgi-bin
[04:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about cgi-bin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:12] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, yes, but this hasn't changed much since
[04:12] <deepsa> !git
[04:12] <nox-Hand> mc44: If I had not I would not be able to tell you that I could not boot it ;) I have all apt-get update/upgrade/dist-upgrade's
[04:12] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about git - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:12] <kleftisx> magnetron : it doesnt matter if i change the beryl repositie from source.lst?
[04:12] <belux> What happens when grub doesn't detect a primary hd?
[04:12] <skinnyc> magnetron: thanks , taking a look now !
[04:12] <Angel-SL> anyone know the default path for CGI-BIN in Feisty Server + LAMP?
[04:12] <johnnybuoy> DeadCowboy, anyway, here is an ndiswrapper howto also: http://www.debiantutorials.org/content/view/153/213/
[04:12] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: why would it need the dns entry if it cannot get to the ip directly anyways?  (since it will have to go through the http proxy?)
[04:12] <bezibaerchen> how do i get the uuid of a parition to add it to fstab?
[04:12] <rohan> crimsun: yes, i am not prodding you again and again :)
[04:13] <Masqy> Which sources.list should I use??
[04:13] <Angel-SL> was it /usr/lib or smth?
[04:13] <mc44> nox-Hand: well yes, but there was more than one version of the -15 kernel
[04:13] <southafrikanse> crimsun: No
[04:13] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: i put the dns entry in -- and its hanging on 'downloading package files'
[04:13] <ikonia_> Angel-SL no - do a find for it
[04:13] <magnetron> kleftisx: don't know, actually
[04:13] <crimsun> southafrikanse: did you check the mixer levels first? :)
[04:13] <southafrikanse> crimsun: It says it is playing but I can't here anything
[04:13] <Angel-SL> !find
=== brion_away is now known as brion-office
[04:13] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about find - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:13] <kleftisx> magnetron : because i get all the beryl updates
[04:13] <_dennis_> orbin: http://img20.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=78375_Qtpartedscreenshot_122_1147lo.jpg
[04:13] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: how to use?
[04:14] <nox-Hand> mc44: No idea, I have just gotten what the upgrades has pulled in. After upgrading to -14 it stopped booting and I just booted -13 until -15 came out since I thought that would fix it. It did not so now I return here for help :)
[04:14] <ikonia_> Angel-SL man find
[04:14] <magnetron> kleftisx: that is not my point

[04:14] <sorcerer> ikonia: mate is it like this  par2 -verify  "chill Out - Ibiza 2 - The Lounge Edition 2007.vol0+1.par2"
[04:14] <ubuntu> I managed to mess up "initrd.img" and "vmlinuz" how can i get them back?
[04:14] <southafrikanse> crimsun: As I mentioned before, I'm still a noob and I'm having a first experience on Ubuntu. Where should I do those operations?
[04:14] <chm0d> Lincoln6Echo, i now the repositories are extremely slow right now or at least I have heard
[04:14] <rohan> woohoo .. feisty is one of the _BEST_ releases of ubuntu ever :)
[04:14] <_dennis_> orbin: so i want to add this 11 giga from sda-1 to sda7
[04:14] <ikonia_> sorcerer try it
[04:14] <fuzzy_logic> hello world

[04:15] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: i don't get it
[04:15] <skinnyc> magentron: thanks...that explains it...700MB  of cap wasted !
[04:15] <southafrikanse> crimsun: I'm there. What now?
[04:15] <ikonia_> Angel-SL type "man find" and then read
[04:15] <surviver> anyone that can help me with devilspie?
[04:15] <DeadCowboy> btw, anyone knows an alternative for having flash plugins running on 64?
[04:15] <mc44> nox-Hand: what error do you get on booting?
[04:15] <DVS01> if i have a directory whose permissions are drwxrwsr-x, octal code 2775 and owner root:somegroup, would that mean that any user who is in group somegroup would have the permissions to add/remove files/dirs from this directory?
[04:15] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: example? i just need one
[04:15] <rohan> is there anyway to enforce networkmanager to use a dns i specify, and not 192.168.1.1 ?
[04:15] <fuzzy_logic> after upgrading to feisty beryl doesn't work.. when i type 'beryl-manager' in terminal i get the following error: Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"....
[04:15] <ikonia_> Angel-SL "man find" is the command, type it
[04:15] <crimsun> southafrikanse: use the left and right arrow keys to navigate; press 'm' to unmute/mute; use the up and down arrow keys to increase/decrease levels
[04:16] <fuzzy_logic> can anyone help plz?
[04:16] <crimsun> southafrikanse: (and ESC to exit)
[04:16] <nox-Hand> mc44: Don't rightly think I get any. Give me a sec, I'll plonk up the laptop and then I can reboot this into Ubuntu -15. I am on my Gentoo partition now ;)
[04:16] <rohan> fuzzy_logic: remove the 3rd party packages, because beryl is in the ubuntu repos now
[04:16] <PirateHead> crimsun: I patebin'd the fresh dmesg here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16563/
[04:16] <PirateHead> crimsun: warning, it's quite long.
[04:16] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: cant you give me a example?!
[04:16] <fuzzy_logic> rohan: i beleive compiz is in de repos
[04:16] <whatthefmanager> Just tried installing 7.04 yesterday. doing the first working boot, I got a hardware drivers FAIL message, and didn't get the graphic login. instead, just the console login. After logging in, I got a bunch of /dev/null: permission denied messages. Startx didn't work, returned the same... and, I wasn't asked for the root password, so I needed to change that in recovery. How do I at least stop the annoying /dev/null permission denied?
[04:16] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: I still dont think it's using the http proxy ---- I'm getting 'connection timed out' to us.archive.ubuntu.com ---- it really shouldn't be using hosts to resolve the IP :: b/c that IP is useless unless it uses the http proxy ----- dont you agree??
[04:16] <mc44> nox-Hand: try update/upgrade while you are there
[04:16] <ikonia_> Angel-SL I'm giving you the exact command "man find"
[04:16] <rohan> fuzzy_logic: compiz is in main, and beryl in universe
[04:16] <kingcobra> hello
[04:17] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: .. it does NOT have an example!
[04:17] <jijutm> priatehead: I managed it .. by *apt-get check*
[04:17] <southafrikanse> crimsun: But should I move? I don't know :(
[04:17] <ikonia_> Angel-SL now I know you've not read it at all
[04:17] <jijutm> and then apt-get update
[04:17] <freakynl> ques... we have a supermicro server. just installed 7.0.4 server. installation goes fine. when it tries to start however i'll get an buffer i/o error on the I2O device (the adaptec raid controller) with an error stating that it couldn't check the partition table and that it isn't going to scan other devices and then it ends. any ideas?
[04:17] <PirateHead> jijutm: did you find that in the man pages? =D
[04:17] <jijutm> yes
[04:17] <chm0d> Lincoln6Echo, anyway you can find out what dns ip the proxy is using?
[04:17] <mikeize> how can anyone get anything asked, answered in here?
[04:17] <surviver> Anyone has some experience with devilspie
[04:17] <ikonia_> mikeize ask and I'll try to answer
[04:17] <crimsun> PirateHead: lsmod|grep ^snd_hda_intel
[04:17] <orbin> _dennis_: and sda7 has kubuntu on it?
[04:17] <skinnyc> magentron: can I upgrade from 6.10 ? wil lthat be easier?
[04:17] <PirateHead> jijtum: awesome. I'll keep that in mind in case my apt database gets stuffed up. And I'll probably read the man pages myself.
[04:18] <PirateHead> crimsun: no output
[04:18] <_dennis_> orbin: yes
[04:18] <kingcobra> can somebody please tell me how to get to appear again the window that used to come up when i inserted a ubuntu install disk
[04:18] <CapaH> I *just* upgraded from Edgy to Feisty, and now KDE will not start (It starts, loads programs from my prior session, then just crashes back to the graphical login prompt) -- GNOME (I am in GNOME now) works --- ideas?
[04:18] <mikeize> how can I read/write my external drive?
[04:18] <fuzzy_logic> rohan: the strange thing is that when i type 'compiz' i get almost the same error: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16564/
[04:18] <crimsun> PirateHead: sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel
[04:18] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: I can get to http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ just fine from my windows PC (which is of course using the http proxy)
[04:18] <kingcobra> it said upgrade disk detected
[04:18] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: too unhelpful.
[04:19] <chm0d> on your windows pc what does it have as dns ip?
[04:19] <surviver> anyone that can help me with configuring devilspie???
[04:19] <PirateHead> crimsun: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16565/
[04:19] <fuzzy_logic> rohan: are you there?
[04:19] <hhlp> hi, i have a problem my pc is freezing when upgrating to feisty, now ubuntu dont start how i can beginig to continue wih the upgrade or i have to install a new one
[04:19] <mikeize> ikonia: thanks, I'm trying to read/write to my external drive
[04:19] <ikonia_> Angel-SL too lazy to read the example
[04:19] <ikonia_> mikeize ok, whats the problem
[04:19] <shirish> guys does anybody know how to add stuff to right-click, I want to add Screen Resolution to my right-click on desktop, anybody has any ideas?
[04:19] <ubuntu> Can someone send me ubuntu's initrd and vmlinuz files that are from / ?
[04:19] <ubuntu> I managed to screw mine up
[04:19] <ubuntu> I think its why ubuntu isnt booting
[04:19] <Tom47> southafrikanse: are you having probs with the alsamixer?
[04:19] <orbin> _dennis_: are you on a livecd?
[04:19] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: I read it! but i only mhave a basic knowledge of linux!
[04:20] <pegger> does anyone have a mac mini running ubuntu server headless???
[04:20] <crimsun> PirateHead: ok, I need to recompile them. This will take a bit.
[04:20] <mikeize> i just switched from windows, and I can't write a file to my external ntfs volume
[04:20] <ikonia_> Angel-SL you didn't read it - its a long man page and you waited 30 seconds
[04:20] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: AND I KNOW NTH ABOUT REGEX.
[04:20] <ikonia_> Angel-SL plus you didn't even look at the examples
[04:20] <babo> The upgrade aborts now. Your system could be in an unusable state. A recovery will run now (dpkg --configure -a).
[04:20] <ikonia_> Angel-SL you don't need to know anything about regex
[04:20] <babo> muthafu**er
[04:20] <surviver> mikeize, jup i used windows to he does autodetect but here in linux ull need to mount them
[04:20] <PirateHead> crimsun: no problem. Say my name when you're done -- it will give me a beep, even though my sound is broken. ^.^
[04:20] <_dennis_> orbin: no, I booted in kubuntu
[04:20] <MacroMax> Questions about $PATH:  I've added "export PATH=$PATH:/home/myhome/localbin"  to my .bashrc which works when I open a new terminal.  However, it's not working from within GNOME directly... from say the Run Application window.  How do you set the path for GNOME?
[04:20] <Angel-SL> ikonia_,
[04:20] <Angel-SL> find / \( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt %#m %u %p\n \) , \
[04:20] <Angel-SL> \( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt %-10s %p\n \)
[04:20] <ikonia_> babo no need for that language
[04:20] <babo> the upgrade path is broken. this sucks ...
[04:20] <chm0d> Lincoln6Echo, on xp its ipconfig /all if you didnt know
[04:20] <chm0d> and see what it has for dns ip address
[04:20] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: i mentioned i was using the graphical update manager for all this ------ i just went to the command line and did 'apt-get update' -- and it's working fine ----- this seems like an issue with the graphical pkg mgr
[04:20] <ikonia_> MacroMax gnome does not run a login shell
[04:21] <sterk> anyone know of a better IRC client than bitchx?
[04:21] <fyi> anyone know how to get the QSYNAPTICS settings to save everytime?
[04:21] <ubuntu> sterk: xchat :)
[04:21] <PirateHead> sterk: Chatzilla
[04:21] <pegger> does anyone have a mac mini running ubuntu server headless???
[04:21] <mikeize> I can see them, and I tried to unmount it, but it says I can't
[04:21] <Angel-SL> GARRGH
=== ubuntu is now known as atomiku
[04:21] <MacroMax> ikonia: I see...  What kind of options do I have?
[04:21] <Angel-SL> i'll head over to the linux channel
[04:21] <matt1982> hey does anyone know if linuxMCE will work on ubuntu 7.04 it says it will needs 6.10 so does that mean it will only work with 6.10
[04:21] <PirateHead> sterk: for readability and easy of use, Chatzilla is awesome.
[04:21] <matt1982> ?
[04:21] <orgy`> fr00d gnome luft jetzt, allerdings erscheint dieses fenster, dass die session weniger als 30 sekunden gedauert hat, wenn ich ok drcke komm ich wieder gdm, als details kam das: http://rafb.net/p/JRXNPB42.html
[04:21] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: our internal DNS servers do not resolve external IP's --- b/c it's useless to do so b/c you can't get to them without the http proxy ------ if you know proxies --- they do hostname resolution anyways --- there's no reason for my ubuntu to know the IP --- it can't do anything with it
[04:21] <surviver> mikeize, try this line in console : sudo mount -o rw /path (here comes the path of the disk
[04:21] <sterk> xchat and chatzilla ehh?
[04:21] <sterk> thank you gentlemen :
[04:22] <andy_> do I have to boot from a live-cd if I want to resize my "/" partition?
[04:22] <southafrikanse> TOM47: I don't know what are you talking about alsamixer. But what should I do to have sound?
[04:22] <nox-Hand> mc44: Back.
[04:22] <atomiku> andy_: yes
[04:22] <nox-Hand> mc44: Allerror I have is:
[04:22] <orbin> _dennis_: well you need to unmount sda7 in order to resize it.
[04:22] <orgy`> oops wrong channel
[04:22] <graeme> I just tried to upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 with the update manager, only for it to fail on the hotkey setup package. Anything I can do about it?
[04:22] <Lincoln6Echo> chm0d: well - the command line apt-get upgrade works ---- the graphical version doesn't ---- there is definitely some issue there
[04:22] <andy_> atomiku, ah, too bad
[04:22] <aimaz> a while back i added my windows drive to my grub menu, but when it upgraded the kernel it removed the item from the menu, how am i supposed to stop that from happening?
[04:22] <nox-Hand> mc44: /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
[04:22] <southafrikanse> TOM47: WHat can I do on alsamixer?
[04:22] <atomiku> Can someone send me ubuntu's initrd and vmlinuz files that are from / ?
[04:22] <atomiku> I managed to mess up "initrd.img" and "vmlinuz" how can i get them back?
[04:22] <atomiku> oops
[04:22] <southafrikanse> TOM47: WHat should I do?
[04:22] <nox-Hand> mc44: Whether that's an error I have no ide
[04:22] <freakynl> ques... we have a supermicro server. just installed 7.0.4 server. installation goes fine. when it tries to start however i'll get an buffer i/o error on the I2O device (the adaptec raid controller) with an error stating that it couldn't check the partition table and that it isn't going to scan other devices and then it ends. any ideas?
[04:22] <atomiku> forget about the second question
[04:22] <orbin> _dennis_: and if it has your system files etc on it, you'd have to resize via a livecd
[04:23] <hhlp> hi, i have a problem my pc is freezing when upgrating to feisty and the pc don't response, now ubuntu dont start how i can continue wih the upgrade or i have to install a new one
[04:23] <ShadowMan> guys, how can i remotely connect to ubuntu from winxp ? like using mstsc ?
[04:23] <kingcobra> what happened to ubuntu+1
[04:23] <freakynl> ShadowMan: vnc, ssh (putty)
[04:23] <Dasnipa`> kingcobra, theres no need for it right now
[04:23] <nox-Hand> mc44: Hang on.... on alt+f1 term I have an alert
[04:23] <_dennis_> orbin: so from the liveCD, and eg not from windows
[04:23] <ShadowMan> but how do i install vnc server on ubunty ?
[04:23] <pibarnas> where are burning, magic lamp and other desktop effects in compiz?!? I've installed compiz-extra and just added showdeskop effect.
[04:24] <surviver> mikeize, if he sais there already mounted just do this : mount -o rw,remount /path(the hdd path)
[04:24] <nox-Hand> mc44: ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/very-long-uuid does not exist. Dropping to a shell!
[04:24] <CompuChip> OK, thanks for the help, all (and ikonia_ in particular).
[04:24] <kingcobra> Dasnipa`, so this is used instead and it was deleted?
[04:24] <Tom47> southafrikanse: crimsun asked you to use alsamixer to make sure things were not muted and volumes were turned up .... typa alsamixer into a terminal or perhaps more easily right click on the speaker icon on the top panel and select Open Volume Control
[04:24] <_dennis_> orbin: ok,did'nt red your last reply, i give it a shot, tnx ;)
[04:24] <CompuChip> I'm out to enjoy my fresh Edgy system :)
[04:24] <kingcobra> jesus its busy in here
[04:24] <freakynl> ShadowMan: dunno don't use it, but there are bound to be howto's on the web
[04:24] <orbin> _dennis_: possibly from windows if you have a partition program as obviosuly kubuntu won't be mounted
[04:24] <Dasnipa`> kingcobra, ubuntu+1 will be back when discussion on the next release is ready to start
[04:24] <surviver> anyone that has ever used devilspie???

[04:26] <rgd> jrib thx
[04:26] <ApesMa> tomcat5.5 seems to require a user named tomcat5.5, but the "users and groups" utility in GNOME won't let me create a user w/period in the username. I will try running adduser by hand, but does anyone know why the GUI tool would not allow such a username?
[04:26] <Tom47> southafrikanse: ok???
[04:26] <MacroMax> How can I go about creating a user specific path usable within GNOME.  I'm giving GNOME a shot from KDE.  In KDE I could just append to the $PATH in ~/.bashrc  Any ideas?
[04:26] <nox-Hand> mc44: Will do, will get back to you with result :D
[04:26] <CapaH> I cannot get KDE to start, it loads then crashes back to the login prompt, does anyone have any suggestions?
[04:27] <crimsun> PirateHead: http://adhd.irule.net/~crimsun/feisty-106843/
[04:27] <vox754> jrib, so this is it? Is this channel officially supporting Feisty?
[04:27] <CapaH> it started/worked fine 5 minutes ago before I upgraded to Feisty
[04:27] <jrib> vox754: yep!
[04:27] <MannyZ> .. I think i got the newest version of beryl for feisty but after enabling the functions which I want to use but I can't get any of them to work.. why?
[04:27] <surviver> anyone has some experience with devilspie ......???
[04:27] <mikeize> survivor, yeah, that's what I tried, and got nothing
[04:27] <PirateHead> crimsun: and should I put those in /lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/kernel/sound/pci/hda/ ?
[04:27] <jrib> surviver: hi again, I take it the docs did not help?
[04:27] <kingcobra> #ubuntu is the 6th biggest irc channel at the moment
[04:27] <ingodonots> mah
[04:27] <Angel-SL> 'cuse me, but the 7.04 LAMP does not have apachectl
[04:27] <surviver> mikeize, try this one now :   sudo mount -o rw,remount /path
[04:27] <ingodonots> nemmeno con questo :gksudo "update-manager -c -d"
[04:27] <crimsun> PirateHead: as you did before, yes.
[04:27] <Angel-SL> !apachectl
[04:27] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about apachectl - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[04:27] <ingodonots> funziona
[04:27] <southafrikanse> Tom47: Sorry. NAture called. I'm back already. There is nothing off on alsamixer
[04:28] <orbin> deepsa: nice desktop. hot day hey? :)
[04:28] <Charron> ok, I've got a Seagate external harddrive hooked up via USB. it worked fine without effort in Edgy, but upon updating to Feisty it won't recognize the drive anymore and I don't know the first thing about mounting. any help?
[04:28] <surviver> jrib, yes i managed to install it but i search the file where i need to set the codes in :D
[04:28] <kingcobra> can somebody please tell me how to get to appear again the window that used to come up when i inserted a ubuntu install disk
[04:28] <BalchD> MadDog011: Unfortunately Restricted Manager doesn't enable my card, and the following instructions don't match 7.04 :-(
[04:28] <deepsa> orbin: yeah ;)
[04:28] <MannyZ> .. I think i got the newest version of beryl for feisty but after enabling the functions which I want to use but I can't get any of them to work.. why?
[04:28] <surviver> jrib, and hy :)
[04:28] <kingcobra> it said upgrade disk detected
[04:28] <mikeize> survivor, again nothing happens
[04:28] <jrib> surviver: ~/.devilspie/SOMENAME.ds
[04:28] <Angel-SL> 'cuse me, but the 7.04 LAMP does not have apachectl..
[04:28] <surviver> jrib, lol oke thx:p
[04:29] <PirateHead> crimsun: I ought to reboot now, yes?
[04:29] <Angel-SL> anyone?
[04:29] <crimsun> PirateHead: sure.
[04:29] <jessid> !kernel
[04:29] <ubotu> kernel is the core of the Ubuntu Operating System (named 'Linux') - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel.  You shouldn't have to compile one, but if you're convinced you do, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild
[04:29] <surviver> jrib, i need to create the file or it already exists?
[04:29] <ikonia_> Angel-SL id does have apachectl
[04:29] <PirateHead> crimsun: brb. I'll grab you a fresh dmesg as I reboot as well.
[04:29] <hhlp> hi, i have a problem my pc was freezing when upgrating to feisty and the pc don't response, now ubuntu dont start i have to resset, how i can continue wih the upgrade my ubuntu dont start
[04:29] <atomiku> I managed to mess up "initrd.img" and "vmlinuz" how can i get them back?
[04:29] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: wierd. it gives me a error and tells me to apt-get apache
[04:29] <pegger>  my mac mini keeps dropping off the network for some reason, and I am tryign to see if anyone else has similar problems
[04:29] <soundray> hhlp: I just had the same experience
[04:29] <jrib> surviver: create it.  I like to have firefox.ds for firefox rules, gaim.ds for gaim rules, etc.
[04:29] <crimsun> atomiku: apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-$(uname -r)
[04:29] <Tom47> southafrikanse:  ok then i think you are ready to resume discussion with crimsun
[04:29] <atomiku> thanks crimsun
[04:30] <optimous> i have ubuntu 6.10 and cannot upgrade to 7.04 coz i have the: cannot initiate dbus
[04:30] <southafrikanse> Tom47: OK
[04:30] <yrlnry> When I put a CD into my CD drive, "Sound Juicer" starts up and offers to let me rip the disc.  But it fails to get the track names, perhaps because MusicBrainz is overloaded.  It has no option to get the information from another source.  Is there an easy way to acquire the track listing from somewhere else, perhaps by using some other program completely?
[04:30] <optimous> any ideas?
[04:30] <atomiku> Hopefuly that is why ubuntu is freezing on boot at about 2%
[04:30] <surviver> jrib, k:) i ' m quiet noob to linx :p only have it for a week, i know the basics now iam going bit farther :p
[04:30] <vox754> jrib, is devilspie mature now? Are those "rules" regular expressions?
[04:30] <hhlp> soundray, and you do it something
[04:30] <soundray> hhlp: you can boot a live CD, mount the root partition, run 'sudo chroot /mnt/ bash' and do a 'dpkg -a --configure'
[04:30] <Barnab1> anzbodz got the desktop effects running on an ATI X1600_
[04:30] <southafrikanse> crimsun: back to your department. Everything is turned on in alsamixer
[04:30] <crimsun> atomiku: probably not. You likely have either the tty migration issue or the initramfs/UUID issue.
[04:30] <jrib> vox754: s-expressions, you can use regular expressions to match with
[04:30] <atomiku> yeah
[04:30] <crimsun> southafrikanse: try model=lg instead of model=lg-lw
[04:30] <atomiku> it took me to busybox at one point
[04:30] <atomiku> I think i messed grub up
[04:30] <jrib> surviver: cool, just remember everyone started taht way
[04:31] <Angel-SL> ikonia_: AHEM.
[04:31] <Angel-SL> root@K9ATHOMESERVER:/# find -name '*apachectl*'

[04:31] <adultswim> I understand this may not be the correct channel to aask this --- if not, just point me to the correct channel :P     When using beryl, my video playback on VLC fails... when I switch back to the Metacity window manager, it works fine... any ideas whats going on?
[04:31] <surviver> jrib, without learning u catn get far ^^
[04:31] <ikonia_> apache2ctl
[04:31] <caffiend_> I have install Ubuntu 7.04 from the live CD (it ran fine). After the install, I rebooted (took the cd out first) but it stopped on a black screen with just a round "waiting" cursor... nothing happens at this point. If I hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 it goes to 'mike-desktop login:_'... any ideas why the GUI wouldn't load or what is wrong?
[04:31] <deobfuscate> Anyone have any idea why my live CD just hangs at a cursor in regular mode and safe mode when it has worked before?
[04:31] <MadDog011> What is better for running beryl on feisty: "XGL" or "AIGLX"
[04:31] <mikeize> thanks anyways, going back to windows
[04:31] <mc44> MadDog011: which video card do you have?
[04:31] <MadDog011> Nvidia
[04:31] <atomiku> So
[04:31] <atomiku> crimsun: how do you reckon I can fix this?
[04:31] <Nippa> adultswim: try in #beryl maybe?
[04:31] <jessid> hello. is it possible to have two different distros in the same computer, for example ubuntu for amd64 and ubuntu for x386??
[04:32] <mc44> MadDog011: then aiglx
[04:32] <boojit> adultswim: i have problems with VLC under beryl too -- it just doesn't work well. I had to go to Mplayer which works fine when using xvid
[04:32] <southafrikanse> crimsun and Tom47: Oh My GOD!!!! I've got sound!!!!!
[04:32] <sorcerer> wats a .odt file ???
[04:32] <MadDog011> mc44, Thanx :) ima Give it a GO :)

[04:32] <crimsun> southafrikanse: right, I'll add your SSID to the quirk list, thanks for the info.
[04:32] <llutz> jessid: sure
[04:32] <mjr> jessid, sure
[04:32] <ikonia_> sorcerer run file against it
[04:32] <MadDog011> mc44, are tehre any install instructions for feisty?
[04:32] <mjr> sorcerer, open document text file; use open office to open it
[04:32] <southafrikanse> crimsun: WHat's the quirk list?
[04:32] <adultswim> boojit, i'll try mplayer... thanks
[04:32] <sorcerer> ikonia umm i did .. doesnt iopen gives me an erorr ..
[04:32] <sorcerer> umm ok
[04:32] <deepsa> Bhaal: wasup man
[04:32] <sorcerer> i can save it as a doc file right
[04:32] <ikonia_> sorcerer I said run "file" against the file
[04:33] <PirateHead> crimsun: still no sound. Want the new dmesg?
[04:33] <ikonia_> sorcerer i didn't say open it
[04:33] <sorcerer> what is run file mean ?
[04:33] <crimsun> southafrikanse: it's a hardcoded list of manufacturer screwups, i.e., a "fix" to the sound driver.
[04:33] <mc44> !beryl > MadDog011
[04:33] <kingcobra> llutz, mjr which would be better for a 2800+ sempron comp with 256 ddr
[04:33] <southafrikanse> crimsun: Thank you very much
[04:33] <wickedpuppy> sorcerer, run in command line , a command called 'file' against the file called whatever_the_name.odt
[04:33] <crimsun> PirateHead: no. Is snd_hda_intel loaded?
[04:33] <nox-Hand> mc44: Still hangs for ages on [#                            ]  at the bootscreen then goes on to busybox. The [#  ]  thing is the regular framebuffer splash for Ubuntu, nothing out of the ordinary.
[04:33] <jessid> llutz mjr, do you have any place where I can start reading about installing both distros in the same computer?
[04:33] <ikonia_> sorcerer it means use the command "file" against your file
[04:33] <nox-Hand> mc44: i.e same error :(
[04:33] <PirateHead> crimsun: how do I tell?
[04:34] <southafrikanse> crimsun: I have another problem to solve
[04:34] <crimsun> southafrikanse: I don't deal with anything but audio bugs.
[04:34] <crimsun> PirateHead: lsmod|grep ^snd_hda_intel
[04:34] <llutz> jessid: search for dual/multi-boot, shouldn't be a problem to find info
[04:34] <sorcerer> wickedpuppy: thnx mate .. now i understand what .. it is .. ITs a command .. thank you
[04:34] <jrib> rgd: do you want to use mplayer or gmplayer?
[04:34] <PirateHead> from the new dmesg:

[04:34] <Nippa> When I try and upgrade to fiesty I get this error: "The upgrade aborts now. Please free at least 14.9M of disk space on /boot." The thing is, I have ~30 megs free on /boot... anyone know what could be causing this?
[04:34] <orgy`> does someone know a solution to this http://rafb.net/p/JRXNPB42.html ? i found a bug report, but theres no help in it https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/93613
[04:34] <atomiku> ubuntu freezes on bootup. no errors. how can I fix this?
[04:34] <southafrikanse> Then who should I call? Just ask and someone will ask right?
[04:34] <Sputnik> This is my error: "ata2.00 : failed to set xfermode(err:mask=0x4)", I gett this when booting and my CD drive is no longer recognized. How to fix it?
[04:35] <llutz> jessid: generally you'll need several partitions on you hdds, where you install the different distros
[04:35] <Sputnik> atomku, we have same problem, I think :] 
[04:35] <crimsun> PirateHead: uh, you copied them to the wrong directory?
[04:35] <atomiku> Sputnik: we being who?
[04:35] <atomiku> :o
[04:35] <jessid> llutz ok!
[04:35] <llutz> jessid: a bootmanager like grub/lilo is used to switch at boottime to the desired one. it's simple
[04:35] <ryeth25> when using irssi, can u change the theme?
[04:35] <Tom47> !ask > southafrikanse:
[04:35] <Progressive> hmm mine freezes during bootup aswell, when recovery mode, lot of this: BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/0xffff0000/0
[04:35] <PirateHead> crimsun: I don't think so.
[04:35] <crimsun> PirateHead: I absolutely do not support self-compiled kernels.
[04:35] <kingcobra> llutz, mjr would x86 or amd64 be better for a 2800+ sempron comp with 256 ddr
[04:35] <deobfuscate> Is Ubuntu able to boot using LILO?
[04:35] <enry> weyyy my totem have some problem with buffer!! in streaming video
[04:36] <crimsun> PirateHead: no, read the actual error message. Look at the `uname -r`s
[04:36] <PirateHead> crimsun: I didn't compile my kernel. It's whatever the last official one was.
[04:36] <enry> how to solve?
[04:36] <boubbin> possible to change encoding from UTF8 to ISO-8859-1 for ONLY a single user ?
[04:36] <llutz> kingcobra: no idea, 64bit make only sense (for me) on servers
[04:36] <ikonia_> kingcobra if your asking that use the 32bit
[04:36] <pegger> hey guys I just set up a mac mini with linux, and for some reason aftera couple hours it will drop off the network,  the really hard part is that I had to bring the mini to work to do the install because that is the only place that I have a monitor, so I bring it back to my apartment and it gets kind of hard to diginose with no monitor
[04:36] <crimsun> PirateHead: then what in the world is 2.6.20.3-ubuntu1 ?
[04:36] <southafrikanse> ! ask > southafrikanse: I've lost WIndows when  I installed Ubuntu, it doesn't appear on the boot menu
[04:36] <hhlp> soundray, thx
[04:36] <vwov> ubuntu's website says i must use the GUI to do a distro upgrade, can't i just use commandline?
[04:36] <surviver> jrib, k i made a file in the map of devilspie add a line and save it as name.ds now it has to work?
[04:36] <southafrikanse> But I still have the WIndows partition with the files
[04:36] <kingcobra> ikonia_, why do you say that
[04:36] <jrib> surviver: restart devilspie
[04:36] <mc44> nox-Hand: and it gives the same error on alt-f1?
[04:36] <ikonia_> kingcobra because if you don't know - you have no need for 64 bit
[04:36] <surviver> mzz its not runnign :p

[04:41] <ikonia_> noob you don't need ndiswrapper for itunes

[04:41] <mc44> nox-Hand: I dont think it is the cause of your problems, but it might be
[04:41] <Daverocks> annihilus: lo is your loopback interface (127.0.0.0/8 , for applications to communicate with the local machine), and eth1 is usually some sort of ethernet/wireless interface

[04:46] <[acid] Neatchee> voids: i have the same card, please PM me and I will try to help you
[04:46] <Daverocks> berent: that's the default behaviour in ubuntu because "ls" is aliased to ls with colour options
[04:46] <eck> berent: because the default behavior is ls --color=auto
[04:46] <Huffalump> Feisty upgrade broke my X/nvidia... Failed to load module wfb.  Can anyone sort me out?
[04:46] <Faithful> berent: because you have aliases or you bashrc is setup so
[04:46] <jrib> binfalse: type 'alias ls'
[04:46] <Kiryn> hey um whats the root's password when u first boot into Ubuntu?
[04:46] <atomiku> Huffalump: yeah it broke mine too
[04:46] <noob> my installer for itunes is a .dmg file am i able to extract and install with WINE?
[04:46] <atomiku> Huffalump: never fixed it though
[04:46] <Huffalump> hello again, atomiku.  i never did find an answer.
[04:46] <jrib> berent: type 'alias ls' .  Sorry binfalse, name completion error
[04:46] <kingcobra> jrib, are you familiar with upgrade volume detected window when you insert ubuntu install disk
[04:46] <ikonia_> Scapy I've just looked at the repo's your pointing to, and they contain all the normal kernels, your repo's should be fine
[04:46] <flodine> can someone tell me how long this new  released supported fiesty?
[04:46] <atomiku> but now ubuntu is completely messed up
[04:46] <jrib> kingcobra: I know of it
[04:46] <JosefK> noob, if it's .dmg you've picked up the apple mac version anyway, that's useless under WINE
[04:46] <Scapy> ikonia, no it isnt my frined :(
[04:46] <eck> !root > Kiryn
[04:46] <Kiryn> ?
[04:47] <hmpedersen> Kiryn, there is no root password.. you use sudo and your account password for administrative stuff
[04:47] <Kiryn> ok
[04:47] <jrib> surviver: yep, that's fine
[04:47] <jenda> ikonia_: oi, thx, I missed that. I've never used lndir
[04:47] <Huffalump> atomiku, still problems with your grub?
[04:47] <Kiryn> i did su root
[04:47] <noob> man i feel like the name says now :$
[04:47] <ikonia_> Scapy I've just looked at that repo - contains all the normal stuff
[04:47] <atomiku> Huffalump: yeah
[04:47] <surviver> jrib, did that
[04:47] <berent> i want to change that fluorescent green color its very painful
[04:47] <Scapy> ikonia, it f'ed my kernel

[04:47] <jrib> surviver: url to your paste?
[04:47] <atomiku> when ubunt boots, it freezes at 1% with no errors
[04:47] <kingcobra> jrib, any idea why it might not be coming up now
[04:47] <eck> Kiryn: ifyou want a root shell, sudo -i
[04:47] <ikonia_> jenda I'm not certain - but I think there is a "shadow" option which copys the dir's but not the contents
[04:47] <surviver> jrib, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16568/
[04:47] <soundray> Kiryn: read the private message that ubotu sent you
[04:47] <Kiryn> whats the diff between su and sudo?

[04:48] <jshriver> good afternoon, I just finished upgrading to feisty and my X is now hosed.. all the text is boxes in X
[04:48] <ikonia_> Scapy log a bug against it, they will be able to tell you what causes smp detection for ubuntu
[04:48] <um_whoa> how do you view the binary file wtmp?
[04:48] <Adyeths> why is the alternate install cd downloading everything from the internet to do an upgrade from edgy instead of pulling stuff off the cd?
[04:48] <Huffalump> atomiku, if/when you have a free moment, I'd appreciate it if you'd consider posting a "me too" type confirmation of the problem at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=415013

[04:49] <jenda> Anyway... I'm totally lost regarding my burner, I haven't been able to get it running for ... about a year. It destroys most CDs. Anyone have a tip what I could try?
[04:49] <hmpedersen> I'm a little concerned about the choices of resolution i have..
[04:49] <jrib> flodine: 18 months
[04:49] <[acid] Neatchee> jshriver: Your font packages are corrupted.
[04:49] <Daverocks> Progressive: i think i heard of someone else with a nforce chipset having problems
[04:49] <surviver> jrib, i need to download it? :p
[04:49] <[acid] Neatchee> I had the same problem 2 weeks ago
[04:49] <soundray> flodine: until 2008
[04:49] <jshriver> acidNeatchee how do I reload them, or what is the package name?
[04:49] <surviver> jrib, try this one
[04:49] <berent> jrib : how to do that

[04:51] <Scapy> whats the difference between ubuntu and debain its self ?
[04:51] <caffiend_> Hey everyone, I installed Ubuntu 7.04 from the live CD (it ran fine). After the install, I rebooted (took the cd out first) but it stopped on a black screen with just a round "waiting" cursor and nothing happens at this point. If I hit Ctrl-Alt-F1 it goes to 'mike-desktop login:_'... any ideas why the GUI wouldn't load or what is wrong?
[04:51] <seanh> I need to make a detailed timeline for my work for the next two years. Basically I need a graphical timeline that I can annotate with lots of writing attached to time periods and deadlines. ANy recommend an application?

[04:51] <chut> i mean links, Huffalump do you know how to move up and down fast?
[04:51] <jshriver> how can you reconfigure X? I forget the dpkg command
[04:51] <b0xii> Huffalump, no links
[04:51] <jrib> surviver: nah, you need to save to   /home/surviver/.devilspie/alex.ds    The . in .devilspie is important.  And the fact that it is in your home directory, not on your desktop is also important

[04:52] <stefg> [acid] Neatchee: i can imageine that a pseudo-/dev can't be mounted through a userspace util ... but that's just common sense
[04:52] <soundray> Scapy: you've come to the wrong place to ask for advice regarding switching to Debian
[04:52] <imon9> hi, can someone tell me, if with command "lsusb" and i get this: Bus 002 Device 002: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port...then what is the port?

[04:54] <h0ax> Is there a sudo apt-get for Metalsploit ?
[04:54] <atomiku> soundray: im on the livecd though
[04:54] <stefg> atomiku: sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-image-generic
[04:54] <Scapy> h0ax, just get it off metasploit man :)
[04:54] <neighborlee> what is the name of binary one can run to find what package contains a given header ?
[04:54] <atomiku> stefg: im on the livecd
[04:54] <Scapy> <3 python
[04:54] <h0ax> scapy i dunno how to install it =/
[04:55] <soundray> atomiku: then you have to chroot your root partition first. What's the /dev name of your root?
[04:55] <Pici> h0ax: No, there isnt.
[04:55] <jrib> surviver: mkdir ~/.devilspie         ~ expands to /home/surviver automatically.  I'll be afk for a bit so ask the channel if you still need help
[04:55] <stefg> atomiku: so mount your partiton and chroot to it
[04:55] <Scapy> and you wanna exploit systems ? hehe
[04:55] <h0ax> no never
[04:55] <h0ax> *rolls eyes*
[04:55] <atomiku> soundray: hmm... /dev/hda8
[04:55] <eck> neighborlee: you need apt-file
[04:55] <atomiku> by the way
[04:55] <Adyeths> ok... how about this question.... how can I safely CANCEL an upgrade thats running from the alternate install cd?
[04:55] <berent> jrib : the fluorescent green is still there in all available schemes
[04:55] <atomiku> My /boot/ partition is on /dev/hda1
[04:55] <Scapy> h0ax, mehhh lies
[04:55] <h0ax> Scapy:  can you pm me plz
[04:55] <neighborlee> eck, ah ok thx
[04:55] <soundray> atomiku: 'sudo mount /dev/hda8 /mnt && sudo chroot /mnt/ bash', then the command above
[04:56] <Scapy> h0ax, 2$ a min
[04:56] <atomiku> hmm
[04:56] <atomiku> soundray: okay
[04:56] <h0ax> for sex or ....
[04:56] <stefg> atomiku: so mount /proc (/sys ?) in the chroot and mount hda1 /in the chroot/ then
[04:56] <imon9> soundry: how did u know it is /dev/ttyUSB0 and not /dev/ttyUSB1 or 2 or 3?
[04:56] <Scapy> no im straight :)
[04:56] <jshriver> hrm reconfiguring X doesnt work..
[04:56] <atomiku> soundray: done
[04:56] <atomiku> now what?
[04:56] <jshriver> rather it didnt fix it
[04:56] <h0ax> same here lol
[04:56] <jessid> some of you know how can I configure a screen saver? I dont know why that option was disabled since 6.10...

[04:56] <h0ax> cam youpm me then scapy lol
[04:56] <Scapy> hehe
[04:56] <michael> is anyone else having trouble with apt-get connecting to the servers?
[04:56] <soundray> atomiku: reboot and check if it worked
[04:56] <h0ax> can*
[04:56] <eck> Adyeths: whether or not you can safely cancel depends on how far along in the install you are...
[04:56] <atomiku> soundray: but?
[04:57] <webby> hi I need some help
[04:57] <Tom47> seanh have you looked at planner?
[04:57] <atomiku> wasnt I supposed to apt-get the thingies
[04:57] <webby> I installed ubuntu for my grandma
[04:57] <webby> didn't want to deal with windows
[04:57] <Adyeths> eck: its busying downloading packages from the net. (which I was trying to avoid by using the alternate install cd in the first place)
[04:57] <soundray> atomiku: you didn't read my lines carefully
[04:57] <webby> so it installed fine, we hooked her up to the internet
[04:57] <Huffalump2> webby, what's the problem?
[04:57] <Kaur> using feisty and dpkg gives: Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs....dpkg: error processing ca-certificates (--configure):
[04:57] <Krazytekn0> toolee, the root password is the password you set up for the first user, you can't log into root in ubuntu
[04:57] <soundray> atomiku: 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install linux-image-2.6.20-15-generic'
[04:57] <webby> they gave us an IP address
[04:57] <Kaur> What to do?
[04:57] <webby> it sees it works, and goes to the ISP page
[04:57] <webby> you need a dialer
[04:57] <Pici> !enter | webby
[04:57] <ubotu> webby: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:57] <bropenguin> hello
[04:57] <jshriver> wtf is pango?
[04:57] <atomiku> soundray: thank you
[04:57] <bropenguin> anyone here
[04:57] <soundray> atomiku: don't forget to mount your /boot partition
[04:57] <Huffalump2> webby, what's the problem?  just spit it out :] 
[04:57] <Adyeths> my plan was to upgrade from the cd. apparently the cd had other plans though.
[04:57] <webby> this worked for windows. but here the dialer doesn't have an installer.
[04:57] <atomiku> soundray: mount it where?
[04:58] <soundray> atomiku: what stefg said
[04:58] <webby> it's a tar.gz. file, extracated it's 3 files without extentions.
[04:58] <soundray> atomiku: in the chroot
[04:58] <Tom47> seanh you can also achieve a lot with calendar in evolution
[04:58] <jshriver> How do you specify language for X?
[04:58] <stefg> atomiku: if you are lucky you have an older kernel to boot... if the installed system won't boot, then you have to proceed as i said...
[04:58] <eck> Adyeths: if it hasn't installed anything yet you can probably safely quit... the thing that you don't want to do is cancel apt while it is installing the packages and possibly leave them in an inconsistent state
[04:58] <webby> how can I install it?! no instructions anywhere.
[04:58] <busfahrer> Excuse me, is it possible to boot another distro that you already have installed, then mount the ubuntu ISO, and run the installer script to install ubuntu into another partition on that computer?
[04:58] <soundray> jshriver: System-Admin-Language Support
[04:58] <Huffalump2> webby, what specifically did you download?
[04:58] <atomiku> soundray: well okay lets just see if it works
[04:58] <Krazytekn0> !keepyouranswersusefull | Pici
[04:59] <atomiku> thigns are just confusing since on one partition i only have a boot folder with grub in it
[04:59] <soundray> busfahrer: no, but what you want can be achieved in a different way. Read the private message from ubotu
[04:59] <stefg> !install | busfahrer
[04:59] <ubotu> busfahrer: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DapperReleaseNotes/UbiquityKnownIssues - See also !automate
[04:59] <webby> from the ISP page there are dialer downloads. for windows its an .exe
[04:59] <soundray> !install > busfahrer
[04:59] <eck> busfahrer: if you have a debian install you can use debootstrap, if not you can put the iso contetns on another partition and boot them with grub
[04:59] <toolee> HI, i use the "alternate ISO" install 7.04,but i can't get the root 'password.how can i do?
[04:59] <Adyeths> ok, how do I cancel when there isn't an option to cancel the upgrade? No option to close the window thats telling me whats going on with the upgrade either?
[04:59] <atomiku> and thats the partition it boots from, grub sets the kernel's root to /dev/hda8
[04:59] <webby> for linux its a tar.gz with just 3 files in it. hold on I'll list it.
[04:59] <jshriver> which icon is language? can't see menu lol
[04:59] <toolee> help me
[04:59] <Huffalump2> webby, you may have to ask the ISP for help.  But please continue, just in case.
[04:59] <faloos> I am wanting to shift from suse to ubuntu, is it possible without loosing all my previous data?
[04:59] <webby> sure, one sec. and thanks.
[04:59] <Pici> !root > toolee  (please see the pm from ubotu)
[04:59] <eck> Adyeths: if you switch to one of the VTs it is logging the current operations of the installer and you might be able to tell if its safe to stop
[04:59] <atomiku> brb seeing if it works
[05:00] <Tom47> faloos in about as many ways as its possible to skin a cat
[05:00] <webby> (I'm not actually there, my dad is there and he's on the phone)
[05:00] <goldbond> hey,when i try to upgrade the process freezes at 65/73 files? is this because the servers are busy?
[05:00] <Tom47> faloos the short answer is yes
[05:00] <Krazytekn0> Too all the people just making the bot do their work, you actually aren't helping anyone. If these people didn't know how to use the website and all the things the bot refers to, they WOULDN'T BE HERE
[05:00] <Krazytekn0> you are just adding to their confusion
[05:00] <faloos> all my data is in the /home directory
[05:01] <ikonia_> Krazytekn0 lots of people are helping, but the bot is causing a lot of flood
[05:01] <jessid> !alternate
[05:01] <webby> Huffalump2: cstart, cstop, ppt-linux
[05:01] <cyris> i'm getting a tone of errors when im updating my repositories, connection refused. is that because the servers are busy ?
[05:01] <gpled> what does ubuntu have a hard time with flat screens?
[05:01] <webby> those are the 3 files there
[05:01] <soundray> Krazytekn0: if you cared to spend a little time here reading the questions, you would soon learn how massively wrong you are.
[05:01] <ubotu> The Alternate CD (available as of Dapper) is the classical text-mode installation CD. Use it if you wish to upgrade via CD, or for an "expert" mode install. For normal installs, use the Desktop CD, which is also a "Live" CD.
[05:01] <gpled> why
[05:01] <amro> half the screen looks garbled when I set a certain resolution- I know it's supported and it worked for me under 6.10. What could be the problem?
[05:01] <Tom47> faloos you will want to back your data up
[05:01] <webby> it looks like a bash shell
[05:01] <soundray> Krazytekn0: there is a reason why people have created the bot, you know
[05:01] <Progressive> well whoever had that problem with nforce and newest feisty, disable usb 2.0 and it starts working
[05:02] <Krazytekn0> soundray, it's spam, and confusing people whereas useful answers do not
[05:02] <ikonia_> soundray he does have a sport of a point, some of ubots responses are 20 lines long and 3 people hit ubot and 60 lines are on screen
[05:02] <ikonia_> s/sport/sort
[05:02] <vox754> Latest stable "ndiswrapper" is 1.42, get it from source
[05:02] <Tom47> faloos then you can install ubuntu in a separate set of partitions and then move you data around ... this is likely to be the most flexible approach ie have both ubuntu and sse insalled
[05:02] <jshriver> here is a screenshot of what's wrong
[05:02] <jshriver> http://www.olympuschess.com/error.png
[05:02] <soundray> ikonia_: that's why there's !goodbotuse
[05:02] <gpled> 7.04 is getting better. got the resolution and hz correct, but still missing the colors
[05:02] <Lowe> how do i mount a memory-card in a card-reader?
[05:02] <Krazytekn0> soundray it quickly shoves the good answers off screen
[05:02] <ikonia_> soundray I know, I wrote it !!! but people arn't using it
[05:03] <majd_> Hey, i'm trying to change the port that open-ssh server listens to, i changed the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and restarted but that's not working
[05:03] <jshriver> Lowe: mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usbdisk
[05:03] <jessid> !screensaver
[05:03] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about screensaver - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:03] <Woody_> hello, i am on 7.04 Beta, how can I upgrade to 7.04 Final with my CD?
[05:03] <ikonia_> soundray one of the reaons I love you is because you do use it
[05:03] <webby> ./cstart outputs: cp:  unable to delete /sbin/ppt-linux
[05:03] <Adyeths> ok... that tells me WHETHER its safe to stop the upgrade. That doesn't tell me HOW to stop the upgrade though.
[05:03] <Lowe> then i insert he card i see "tifm 7xx1: sd card detected in socket 3" in the log
[05:03] <jessid> !screen
[05:03] <ubotu> screen is a terminal multiplexer. See http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen
[05:03] <stefg> Krazytekn0: so start giving useful answers, instaed of insulting volunteers, who are not here to spoonfeed people, but to give them something to *learn*
[05:03] <ikonia_> Adyeths you can't stop the upgrade
[05:03] <nox-Hand> mc44: Not going well :(
[05:03] <Huffalump2> webby, wow.  I have no idea what that is, sorry.  I just spent a minute on google in hopes of a prompting... but nada.
[05:03] <wastrel> stefg:  actually we spoonfeed people plenty
[05:03] <eck> majd_: check the logs to see if sshd had a problem binding to that port
[05:03] <tokyoahead> hi guys.... how can I switch ubuntu 7.4 to use the screen resolution of 1280x800? /etc/x11/xorg.conf lists the resolution under screen section, but I cannot choose it on the screen resolution preferences....
[05:03] <ikonia_> stefg the best response
[05:03] <webby> grep/what/lib/dhcp/dhclient -.linux no such file directory
[05:03] <mc44> nox-Hand: what happened?
[05:03] <Huffalump2> webby, what is the windows .exe file?
[05:03] <webby> its just an installer
[05:04] <majd_> eck, where would i find the logs?
[05:04] <Adyeths> thanks ikonia. that answers one of my questions.
[05:04] <eck> majd_: although i would recommend just keeping it on port 22 and using ssh keys
[05:04] <amro> half the screen looks garbled when I set a certain resolution- I know it's supported and it worked for me under 6.10. What could be the problem?
[05:04] <Krazytekn0> stefg : i find that telling people to listen to this recording (read this by a bot) then go to the website does not promote learning, learning is achieved through interaction, not automation
[05:04] <eck> majd_: it's either /var/log/messages or /var/log/auth.log
[05:04] <majd_> eck, so i can keep port 22 open on two computers and ssh into either of them?
[05:04] <rysiek|pl> guys, has anything got broken in feisty since beta as far as the i915 kernel module (for Intel's i94x gf cards) is concerned?
[05:04] <clop> hi, fresh install of feisty x64; my /usr/src/linux directory is empty, what package do i need to get to get the kernel sources here?
[05:04] <Progressive> Daverocks: ive fixed the problem, its with nforce usb 2.0, now it booted no problem.. (i disabled usb 2.0 in bios)
[05:04] <Huffalump2> And the function of this is like PPPoE dialer or ?
[05:04] <verb3k> guys ...what's wrong with the medibuntu repositories ? they are extremely slow ....do you have the same problem or it's just my connection?
[05:04] <webby> yes
[05:04] <soundray> tokyoahead: you have to do a 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg'. Ubotu will send you a private msg
[05:04] <stefg> !offtopic | Krazytekn0
[05:04] <ubotu> Krazytekn0: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[05:04] <Daverocks> Progressive: nice
[05:04] <webby> exactly, it's just a dialer for a cable modem
[05:04] <soundray> !fixres > tokyoahead
[05:04] <eck> majd_: you can do it with port forwarding, although at that point i guess you might as well run it on antoher port
[05:04] <Huffalump2> ok
[05:04] <Krazytekn0> stefg I spend many hours here helping people, and my answers get shoved out of the way by bot commands that say to go to the website
[05:04] <Adyeths> the other question which I asked first was.... why didn't the alternate install cd us whats on the cd for the upgrade like the instructions said it would instead of download everything off the net?
[05:05] <Adyeths> use*
[05:05] <ikonia_> Adyeths no idea
[05:05] <Progressive> daverocks: who was this other guy, cuz he had a hanging system after usb check aswell and a nforce chipset aswell

[05:05] <rysiek|pl> I had it working like a charm in feisty beta and now it just won't go (I mean the direct rendering)
[05:05] <um_whoa> relax, krazyk, it is all good
[05:05] <faloos> Tom47 : thanks for the information
[05:05] <berent> jrib : the fluorescent green is still there in all available schemes
[05:05] <dac> where do I go to find out,kind of computer I have?
[05:05] <eck> majd_: if you are going to use more than one port, make sure you use .ssh/config so you don't have to suffer the indignity of specifying the port each time you connect
[05:05] <tokyoahead> orbin should not be, its a laptop with 60hz

[05:07] <Adyeths> it doesn't look like its downloading just documentation though. its downloading EVERYTHING. which is disappointing because the whole reason I chose to upgrade from the alternate install cd was to avoid the network congestion that was going on.
[05:07] <matt1982> ahh tahts better got my nick back

[05:08] <Krazytekn0> Adyeths, yes, I misspoke (mistyped?) I meant that what the docs say will happen and what actually happens are sometimes different

[05:09] <atomiku> okay
[05:09] <Huffalump2> atomiku, okay... as in you solved X?
[05:09] <eck> majd_: if you are concerned turn off password auth, but i don't think it problematic
[05:09] <Krazytekn0> whatthefmanager, have you tried sudo gdm?
[05:09] <K^Holtz> While upgrading from edgy to feisty, i get the following error when typing sudo apt-get update: .. is it ok to just move on to the upgrade command?

[05:09] <frederific> Lowe: Sorry, no idea then. My SD cards automatically mount :S
[05:09] <Stormx2> Yo. How can I tell gnumeric not to simplify out "1937/13" into "149". Just leave it in its original form? Hoow? :)
[05:09] <atomiku> Huffalump2: not yet
[05:10] <Huffalump2> K^Holtz, please use pastebin
[05:10] <atomiku> When ubuntu loads I now get a initramfs error
[05:10] <atomiku> :(
[05:10] <majd_> eck, right now when i try to connect, it says No address associated with nodename
[05:10] <K^Holtz> Huffalump, i know im sorry, ithoguth it would go on one line
[05:10] <alex-weej> Stormx2: enter it as a string with a ' at the start
[05:10] <babo> will an upgrade, upgrade my kernel too ? ( I'm guessing no )
[05:10] <Lowe> frederific: mine doesnt :(. thanks anyway
[05:10] <alex-weej> babo: yes it will
[05:10] <Krazytekn0> babo usually it will
[05:10] <babo> :-)
[05:10] <Woody_> vwow: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading
[05:10] <Woody_> sorry for taking so long to answer you, i was busy
[05:10] <whatthefmanager> Krazytekn0, not in the sudoers. But I want to know why gdm is not showing up, right after installing. How can I fix that? It is running
[05:10] <alex-weej> babo: are you an ex-gentoo user? :P
[05:10] <mg___> ikonia, ah ok. did they rename ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso to feisty-alternate-i386.iso because the hashes are identical
[05:10] <atomiku> When ubuntu boots it takes me to some shell and mentions something about initramfs how can I fix this?
[05:10] <Kaur> using feisty and dpkg gives: Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs....dpkg: error processing ca-certificates (--configure):
[05:10] <nox-Hand> mc44: Yes sir
[05:11] <hmpedersen> How do I get to use a higher resolution?
[05:11] <Kaur> How to solve?
[05:11] <babo> alex-weej: yeah, I got sick of compiling ....
[05:11] <ikonia_> mg___ probably
[05:11] <z0man> Much better :)
[05:11] <eck> majd_: did you specify ListenAddress in the sshd config?
[05:11] <CapaH> Maybe someone here knows how to do this, I am downloading an ISO (Ubuntu Feisty 64) --- I have downloaded 694,000 out of 792,000 -- and I *really* dont want to restart the download, is there some way I can do this? :)
[05:11] <alex-weej> babo: ;)
[05:11] <soundray> !fixres > hmpedersen, please read ubotu's pm
[05:11] <Krazytekn0> whatthefmanager sorry to say I'm probably not the guy to help you, you could try the bug website... sorry again
[05:11] <majd_> eck, no...
[05:11] <whatthefmanager> Krazytekn0 thanks
[05:12] <hmpedersen> soundray, thanks
[05:12] <yasser> im getting a black screen on bootup...is there any way i can make ubuntu boot in verbose mode??
[05:12] <Krazytekn0> CapaH what did you use to download before?
[05:12] <soundray> CapaH: what do you want to do?
[05:12] <z0man> Cannot seem to control the mixer any more :( Since I used alsamixer..
[05:12] <K^Holtz> While upgrading from edgy to feisty, i get the following error when typing sudo apt-get update: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16576/ .. is it ok to just move on to the upgrade command?
[05:12] <atomiku> soundray: when ubuntu boots it takes me to some shell and mentions something about initramfs how can I fix this?
[05:12] <eck> majd_: well it sounds like it is trying to associate with a host name that it can't lookup, but i haven't seen that error before so it could be something else
[05:12] <auTONYmous> I'm having a problem with NTFS-3G on a USB drive
[05:12] <atomiku> I copied the /boot/ dir from my / partition to my boot partition
[05:12] <atomiku> grub loaded fine.
=== Insurgent is now known as Huffalump
[05:12] <gpled> how do you change screen color depth in 7.04?
[05:12] <Huffalump> Can anyone point me in the correct direction to solve Failed to load module wfb after an upgrade to Feisty?
[05:12] <CapaH> Krazytekn0: What I did, is I used firefox (DOH) to download 9/10ths of the file, and now I have a file that is 692,XXX bytes and I just need maybe another 100,000 bytes
[05:12] <Krazytekn0> soundray I think CapaH is saying that he/she wants to resume downloading where they left off
[05:13] <CapaH> that is exactly what I am saying
[05:13] <yasser> im getting a black screen on bootup...is there any way i can make ubuntu boot in verbose mode??
[05:13] <atomiku> CapaH: cant be done
[05:13] <atomiku> you using firefox?
[05:13] <razzorz> The D/L of the new distro... what will that do to my exsisting ???
[05:13] <jrib> yasser: choose "recovery mode"
[05:13] <soundray> atomiku: it can't work that way. You have to chroot to the final setup with /boot mounted, then reinstall the image package.
[05:13] <CapaH> Well I used firefox originally but I am welcome to use anything to get the last part of the file :)
[05:13] <razzorz> i should say the Install
[05:13] <Pici> K^Holtz: Probably, since thats not an official repository, they might not have a feisty section that exists.  I think you will be fine ignoring it.
[05:13] <yasser> jrib: then??
[05:13] <annihilus> i am trying to install feisty form the desktop cd, intially i was getting an XServer error telling me No Screens Found, but now i cant even make it past Configuring Network Interfaces on bootup, anone have any ideas what is going on
[05:13] <Huffalump> razzorz, it will upgrade it
[05:13] <eck> atomiku: unmount /boot and remove /boot from /, otherwise you will have a hard time telling whree it is reading files from
[05:13] <atomiku> soundray: okay so can you tell me how please if thats okay
[05:13] <jrib> yasser: then you will get messages while you bootup
[05:13] <atomiku> eck: not totally sure how
[05:13] <K^Holtz> thanks Pici
[05:14] <Krazytekn0> CapaH unfortunately firefox doesn't support download resuming, I would suggest you install a good download manager for these types of files, sorry to break the bad news
[05:14] <razzorz> thats it.. .. just the upgrade.. the one off the ubuntu site
[05:14] <soundray> CapaH: you can continue the download with wget -c URL , where URL is the address you previously used in firefox
[05:14] <majd_> eck, well...is there a way for me to connect through port 23, but have that port forward the call to my local computer and mask it as port 22?
[05:14] <eternalswd> "update-manager -d" isn't detecting distro upgrade.  I get a "warning: could not initiate dbus" message in the terminal. any ideas?
[05:14] <atomiku> nothing is really mounted at the moment, since im on the livecd
[05:14] <yasser> jrib: so do i have to always boot using recovery mode!!??
[05:14] <soundray> atomiku: I told you before how to chroot.
[05:14] <yasser> jrib: to avoid the black screen??
[05:14] <jrib> yasser: no, but this will let you figure out what the problem is
[05:14] <atomiku> soundray: i forgot
[05:14] <atomiku> its not gonna be in the logs either
[05:14] <eck> atomiku: well if you just copied it over to a new partition you have the stuff in two places, you should only have it in one place
[05:14] <Rondom> #ubuntu is 1337 :-)
[05:14] <CapaH> soundray: *Maybe* this will work (goes to try it) -- I just need to be in the same dir as the file I originally got right?
[05:14] <verb3k> guys ...what's wrong with the medibuntu repositories ? they are extremely slow ....do you have the same problem or it's just my connection?
[05:14] <Huffalump> yasser, let me know if yours says Failed to load module wfb
[05:14] <soundray> atomiku: that's your problem then. You can't ask me to repeat myself.
[05:15] <atomiku> soundray: come on man
[05:15] <soundray> CapaH: yes
[05:15] <atomiku> i thought it would have worked first time
[05:15] <yasser> jrib: i think the prob is the usplash.....its causing headaches to so many.........!
[05:15] <atomiku> I cant even check my logs
[05:15] <eck> majd_: usually you can configure the router to e.g. pass traffic on port 23 to 192.168.x.x on port y
[05:15] <Rug_> verb3k: world + dog are hitting those servers, give it time
[05:15] <Krazytekn0> soundray, so wget will automatically know that firefox started the download?  I never knew this
[05:15] <jrib> yasser: oh does ubuntu still load after the black screen?
[05:15] <soundray> atomiku: next time use a pen and paper
[05:15] <atomiku> soundray: I shall
[05:15] <soundray> atomiku: 'sudo mount /dev/hda8 /mnt && sudo chroot /mnt/ bash'
[05:15] <verb3k> Rug_: I think so......do you experience the same problem?
[05:16] <atomiku> thank you. now what about /boot/ what do you want me to do with it?
[05:16] <pipak> hello :) I have a little question: could anyone point me to a good lightweight IDE to program in perl (no emacs and such for me)?
[05:16] <valerie> hello can anyone help please?
[05:16] <valerie> i have a problem with wine when i do wine dvdshrink.exe i get an error from wine telling me "set up was unable to create the directory " C:Windows\is-BTU2T.temp"  error 3. path not found
[05:16] <jshriver> When I try to load a program I get a lot of crap about "pango"
[05:16] <Rug_> verb3k: nope, I haven't upgraded yet.  I won't upgrade for awhile.    I don't need to
[05:16] <jshriver> I did a search and that seems to be an internationalized language package? How do I revert back to English
[05:16] <eck> majd_: i think it is sometimes called port triggering by the router
[05:17] <Huffalump> pipak, I think Bluefish does perl
[05:17] <yasser> jrib: it did not initially....but when i added vga=0x311 and splash=silent....i see the gdm after 33 sec
[05:17] <verb3k> Rug_: I see ....thanks for your precious time :)
[05:17] <CapaH> This wget -c appears to be working
[05:17] <eck> jshriver: pango is the gnome/gtk text rendering engine, you need it even if you have english only
[05:17] <atomiku> soundray: thank you. now what about /boot/ what do you want me to do with it?
[05:17] <rysiek|pl> guys, what's with the i915 kernel driver? why do I get a load of "i915: Unknown symbol drm_something_something" and no direct rendering? it worked like a charm in beta!
[05:17] <jshriver> how do you tell pango to use english then?
[05:17] <jshriver> or setup my language preference in X
[05:17] <eck> jshriver: it is set by your locale/the application, not pango
[05:17] <Rug_> verb3k: just warning you that all the servers are getting maxxed out, so it will be slow
[05:17] <yasser> i really think etch is better:) did not gimme ANY probs....
[05:17] <valerie> i have a problem with wine when i do wine dvdshrink.exe i get an error from wine telling me "set up was unable to create the directory " C:Windows\is-BTU2T.temp"  error 3. path not found
[05:17] <garryFre> pipak Might try Eclipse it has many plugins for things like ruby, and perl.
[05:17] <jshriver> hrm how do I set my locale for the system then lol
[05:18] <atomiku> valerie: #winehq
=== bigjb__ is now known as bigjb
[05:18] <eck> jshriver: usually you would set it as the language option in the gdm login screen
[05:18] <Gambaroni> How do I check what network card I have in ubuntu?
[05:18] <soundray> atomiku: in the chroot, do 'mount /dev/hda1 /boot' (use the real dev name of your boot partition)
[05:18] <Pici> pipak,garryFre: Eclipse is hardly lightweight.
[05:18] <jrib> yasser: oh so it just usplash.  I haven't seen that before, maybe someone else can help
[05:18] <verb3k> Rug_: That's where bittorrent comes in handy ....
[05:18] <verb3k> Rug_: but that's only for the ISOs
[05:18] <atomiku> soundray: Okay one second mate :)
[05:18] <jshriver> eck: is there a way of doing that from the cli? or would you be willing to walk me threw it? since I can't read the strings, I have no idea which to click on
[05:18] <eck> jshriver: or system > administration > language support
[05:18] <Rug_> verb3k: yes ofcourse to get the .sio's but BT won't help the repos
[05:18] <garryFre> pipak oops, I didn't see the light weight
[05:19] <Huffalump> Gambaroni, find the Device Manager
[05:19] <superm1> hey guys, for doing a server upgrade to feisty, http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading, it says to use update-manager-core.  this package doesn't appear to be in main though?
[05:19] <Rug_> variant: =) beat me to it
[05:19] <pipak> garryFre: indeed it's not very lightweight, but it's still maybe worth a try :)
[05:19] <atomiku> soundray:
[05:19] <atomiku> root@ubuntu:/# mount /dev/hda1 /boot
[05:19] <atomiku> mount: you must specify the filesystem type
[05:19] <verb3k> Rug_: yeah
[05:19] <Rug_> ack
[05:19] <kiryn> how do I change my screen resolution i hate 1024x768 I want 1280x1024@60
[05:19] <gpled> how do you change screen color depth in 7.04?
[05:20] <Pici> !fixres > kiryn (see the message from ubotu)
[05:20] <eck> gpled: what depth is it now?
[05:20] <gpled> eck: how can you tell?
[05:20] <Black_Monkey> hi, I'm using an AMD Athlon 64, is it advisable to use the k7 kernel? (32-bit installation)
[05:20] <Huffalump> !fixres > kiryn
[05:20] <Krazytekn0> kiryn the only way I know to do it is, sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf then add (1280X1024) to all the applicable lines, you'll know which ones when you see it
[05:20] <Scapy> im thinking of going back to bsd
[05:20] <Scapy> after this SMP problem
[05:20] <Scapy> heh
[05:20] <eck> gpled: try xdpyinfo
[05:20] <kiryn> Krazytekn0, I did but it doesn't show up as a option :\
[05:21] <eck> gpled: 24 is normal
[05:21] <atomiku> mount: you must specify the filesystem type
[05:21] <atomiku> any idea why?
[05:21] <Scapy> -t
[05:21] <soundray> atomiku: is /dev/hda1 really your boot partition?
[05:21] <gpled> eck: thats what i suspect it is set to.  think it should be 16
[05:21] <atomiku> soundray: it has /boot/, vmlinuz and initd.img inside it, this partition is set as boot.
[05:21] <Krazytekn0> kiryn how many lines did you add it to?
[05:21] <letronje> hi can i download all the files required for upgrade and then do the upgrade once all the download is over ?
[05:21] <eck> gpled: look at /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:22] <Stormx2> Okay. In gnumeric, how do I return day of the week like "monday" from a date?
[05:22] <enry> there is a BUG in TOTEM
[05:22] <Huffalump> letronje, I believe that's how it works by default
[05:22] <kiryn> I edited all and added "1280x1024"
[05:22] <eck> gpled: and just comment out the section for 24 bit resolution
[05:22] <letronje> i am upgrading my ubuntu server from edgy to fiesty using do-release-upgrade
[05:22] <LjL> !bugs > enry    (enry, see the private message from Ubotu)
[05:22] <um_whoa> what buy is that?
[05:22] <hmpedersen> Well.. I did as instructed on the page... Now i\ve lost all widescreen resolutions.. Only choices being 640x480 / 800x600 and 1024x768
[05:22] <enry> WEy totem cannot play video in streaming
[05:22] <Haekke> Hello, is it perfecctly safe to use the upgrade to upgrade from 6.1 to 7.04?
[05:22] <Black_Monkey> kiryn: I had a similar problem after installing the nvidia driver - if you go into your settings, go to the monitor > hardware, or whatever it is in gnome, I'm guessing it shows it as a generic monitor?
[05:22] <um_whoa> erm, what buG is that?
[05:22] <atomiku> soundray:
[05:22] <atomiku> root@ubuntu:/# mount -t ext3 /dev/hda1 /boot
[05:22] <atomiku> mount: special device /dev/hda1 does not exist
[05:22] <frederific> letronje: I think you can download the alternative iso from bit-torrent/whatever, then burn it, boot it, and choose upgrade
[05:22] <hmpedersen> Oh.. And my keyboard has reverted to british I see
[05:22] <eck> Haekke: it is safe but i would wait, the apt servers are pretty hammered right now
[05:23] <Black_Monkey> kiryn: change that to a 1280x1024 resolution, worked for me
[05:23] <atomiku> soundray: let me pastebin the contents of sudo fdisk -l for you
[05:23] <enry> um_whoa,  my totem cannot play video in straming

[05:23] <gpled> eck: is it possible to set it to 32bit?
[05:23] <Scapy> eck
[05:23] <Scapy> is it past the beta stage  eck
[05:23] <matt1982_> hey is it possible to upgrade from 6.06 to 6.10?
[05:23] <install_problems> alright, anyone feel like helping someone who's having installation problems?
[05:23] <letronje> <Huffalump>: it says "Fetching and installing the upgrade can take several hours and cannot be canceled at any time later."
[05:23] <Krazytekn0> kiryn did you restart since then?

[05:24] <magnetron> !anyone > install_problems
[05:24] <eagles0513875> is ntfs-3g 64 bit compatable cuz i have a feeling that is whats locking me out from my windows partition
[05:24] <jrib> matt1982_: dapper = 6.06, edgy = 6.10
[05:24] <Black_Monkey> kiryn: do you use an obscure monitor?
[05:24] <eagles0513875> wrong channel
[05:24] <matt1982_> jrib: cool cheers
[05:25] <kiryn> the monitor is KDSusa
[05:25] <Black_Monkey> one that might not be auto-detected?
[05:25] <eck> gpled: yeah, but i'm not sure if it actually works... iirc 32 bit on windows is the same as 24 bit on x11
[05:25] <soundray> atomiku: try this outside the chroot (in another terminal)
[05:25] <install_problems> yeah, i'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 to a mobile disk (which should be sda1 on my system) but every time i run the installer i get a failure msg from the partitioner
[05:25] <Krazytekn0> kiryn the section it's in should be Screen
[05:31] <eagles0513875> is this the feisty support channel
[05:31] <jrib> eagles0513875: yes
[05:31] <Haekke> eck: ok thanks Ill wait a bit then
[05:31] <letronje> <Huffalump>: the upgrade cd will contain only a minimal set of apps right? for the remaining apps already installed on the server, i will have to download updates right ?
[05:31] <atomiku> soundray: wont that mount the /boot/ partition on the livecd, is this what we want?
[05:31] <eagles0513875> is ntfs-3g 64 bit compatable cuz i have a feeling that is whats locking me out from my windows partition
[05:31] <soundray> atomiku: I meant fdisk -l
[05:31] <eck> gpled: 24 bit is 8 bits per color channel which is what most monitors actually display with
[05:31] <eagles0513875> i type in my password and once i hit enter everythign locks ups
[05:31] <atomiku> soundray: okay, fdisk -l worked fine
[05:31] <kiryn> Krazytekn0, Black_Monkey you talking about in the X11/xorg.conf? I'll post it if you want?
[05:31] <soundray> atomiku: is /dev/hda1 really your boot partition?
[05:31] <atomiku> /dev/hda1   *           1         522     4192933+  83  Linux
[05:31] <Pici> gpled: 32bit color (windows) is the same as Linux's 24bit color plus an 8bit buffer.
[05:31] <Black_Monkey> kiryn: no, just in the GUI settings
[05:31] <atomiku> soundray: why yes it is :)
[05:31] <Krazytekn0> kiryn yes, post it and give me a link

[05:31] <atomiku> soundray: thats alright, thanks for the help
[05:31] <nox-Hand> My uuid for root= in grub seems to be wrong and I cannot boot latest two kernel upgrades from Ubuntu
[05:31] <MFen> congrats on the release!  Anyone know where I can get a LiveCD?  either 6.10 or 7.04 would be fine, the website search is down
[05:31] <nox-Hand> I need help :(
[05:31] <Attis> whee, hey dumb quick question how do I switch on Xchat's user list window lol
[05:31] <kiryn> Krazytekn0, http://rafb.net/p/sUsZnR21.html
[05:31] <soundray> nox-Hand: check what the correct ones are with blkid, or use the device names instead
[05:31] <nox-Hand> soundray: blkid?
[05:31] <Dr_willis> Attis,  it may just be drug to the right side and not showing.
[05:31] <gpled> eagles0513875: this is the driver that the boot disk uses for install, so i asume it is the generic.  using 7.04.  not sure if that means feisty
[05:31] <nox-Hand> soundray: ah
[05:31] <hmpedersen> Can anyone help me fix my resolution? I've been trough the howto that ubotu sends me to.. Doesn't help me the least bit
[05:31] <Black_Monkey> kiryn: I missed the beginning of this, have you always had this problem, or is it just after installing binary ATI drivers or something?
[05:31] <Stig> My user list was dragged to the right side too
[05:31] <gpled> if i drop the res down to 768, seems to work
[05:31] <Attis> No I have a button that I can click to show a mini-menu for the users, but I guess I'll have to figure this out. It's a bit different from a version of Xchat I used to use on another distro.
[05:31] <kiryn> Black_Monkey, I always had this issue with Ubuntu but no other distro
[05:31] <matkix0s> Anyone know how to go about installing Beryl on dapper 6.06?
[05:31] <kiryn> i would always get the max of 1027x768 and it hurts my eyes
[05:31] <q07sa> yeah
[05:31] <kiryn> too big
[05:31] <gpled> but the flat screen specs call for 1024
[05:31] <q07sa> i installed
[05:31] <tokyoahead> guys I triedt o change the screen resoltion and installed the 915resolution driver, it lists the mode but they do not appear in the dropdown in the settings... any idea what I have to do ?
[05:31] <q07sa> but in 7.04 feisty fawn
[05:31] <matkix0s> !beryl
[05:31] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[05:31] <kiryn> i always gotta have a high resolution :P
[05:31] <q07sa> what graphics have you got?
[05:31] <hansen_> hey guys, buildning a library for Rhythmbox is painfully slow, im on track 1500 out of 40.000 now... whats the deal?:)
[05:31] <fiestyfoe> hey can someone help me fix my resolution...
[05:31] <kiryn> q07sa, me? ATI X300SE
[05:31] <eagles0513875> good luck with ur ati
[05:31] <tokyoahead> q07sa: or me?
[05:31] <kiryn> i hate ATI
[05:31] <q07sa> ok
[05:31] <q07sa> wait a moment
[05:31] <kiryn> me wants nVidia
[05:31] <q07sa> and ill give you a link
[05:31] <fiestyfoe> and why does fiesty and 6.10 seem to be much slower on my comp then 6.06??
[05:31] <gpled> q07sa: it is a dell, so should be intell
[05:31] <fiestyfoe> I have nvidia graphics
[05:31] <gpled> intel
[05:31] <kiryn> gpled, mines a Sony Vaio
[05:31] <aurel86> crimsun: just one thing about that problem with sound. I need to use that commands everytime i start system, is it possible to start it automatically?
[05:31] <Insurgent> atomiku, one ugly temporary workaround is to:  nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf  where you find the entry for your video card (probably two lines) and change the driver value from "nvidia" to "nv"  .  Frankly, it sucks, but that will get you into X
[05:31] <eagles0513875> i have ntfs-3g enabled for my windows partition but for some reason it seems to lock me out and not log me in whatso ever.
[05:31] <q07sa> kyrin, http://wiki.beryl-project.org/wiki/Install_Beryl_on_Ubuntu_Edgy_with_XGL_and_ATI
[05:31] <joshjosh> i've done sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and get no new packages. Am i up to date or no?
[05:32] <jube> How can I change the mount point for an extended partition? It is currently mounted as /media/disk... but I don't see it in the fstab so not sure how to change it.
[05:32] <eagles0513875> i have nvidia on asus mobo with amd processor and and nforce4 chipset
[05:32] <joshjosh> I haven't been able to download new packages for a week.
[05:32] <Attis> Hmm I swear this is the last junk PC I'll ever buy. Emachines monitors don't get recognized well on any distro I've tried lol.
[05:32] <ZeZu> emachines ...
[05:32] <ZeZu> garbage
[05:32] <fiestyfoe> Anyone help my figure out how to fix fiesty????
[05:32] <Miguel> hello
[05:32] <Attis> ZeZu, at least it runs.
[05:32] <boubbin> how to link 2 kubuntus together in network ?
[05:32] <disasm> fiestyfoe: whats the problem?
[05:32] <Attis> I can actually do my java programming and other class work lol.
[05:32] <kiryn> q07sa, whats that for?
[05:32] <ZeZu> every component they use is junk unless you pay just as much as buying from elsewhere
[05:33] <disasm> boubbin: a switch/hub?
[05:33] <orgy`> hi, im getting this on gnome startup http://rafb.net/p/Ijkt5856.html
[05:33] <Attis> ZeZu, again it still works lol
[05:33] <boubbin> disasm: adsl router
[05:33] <Krazytekn0> kiryn hmm... that looks right to me, if that's definitly saved as /etc/X11/xorg.conf then you should have the options in your gui
[05:33] <ZeZu> sure
[05:33] <fiestyfoe> disasm: first thing is my resolution-- in 6.06 and 6.10 it was fine, now its 1024 x 786 or something else god awful
[05:33] <disasm> boubbin: does it have multiple ports?
[05:33] <mahdi> hi, could anybody help me plz? Just installed feisty and now my sound doesnt work! Worked perfectly on edgy! cat /dev/sndstat says audio device: NOT ENABLED IN CONFIG
[05:33] <boubbin> disasm: yeah, 4
[05:33] <Krazytekn0> kiryn sorry I couldn't help more
[05:33] <Attis> 1024 is awful? Come on, my poor eyes can barely see at that resolution.
[05:33] <kiryn> Krazytekn0, thanks for you time anyways much apprication
[05:33] <Krazytekn0> fiestyfoe what does fine mean?
[05:33] <gpled> lspci shows intel 82816 815
[05:34] <disasm> fiestyfoe: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg - then choose resolutions you want to support
[05:34] <Samuli^> what's the ubuntu support channel for beryl?
[05:34] <mahdi> when i was on feisty beta with linux-image-2.6.20-12 it worked fine too. With linux-image >= 2.6.20-13 i get no sound
[05:34] <boubbin> disasm: i have managed to transder files 10mb/s via apache but id like to browse the network with like konqueror
[05:34] <kritzstapf> how can i configure which channel is controlled by the OSD-volume-control which shows up when i press volume keys on my keyboard?
[05:34] <disasm> boubbin: what exactly are you trying to do?
[05:34] <z> Hey all, i get this problem when trying to update from 6.10 to 7.04
[05:34] <Ferrixman> sorry.... i have an ati X1400, the first time i installed the drivers on ubuntu everything worked fine, but today i had to re-install ubuntu and once i reinstalled my ati drivers, it doesn't work properly
[05:34] <SlimeyPete> Samuli^: #ubuntu-effects
[05:34] <jube> How can I change the mount point for an extended partition? It is currently mounted as /media/disk... but I don't see it in the fstab so not sure how to change it.

[05:34] <disasm> boubbin: ah, you want file sharing?
[05:34] <Angel-SL> AAAgh!!!!
[05:34] <nox-Hand> soundray: the uuid is the same :-/
[05:34] <boubbin> disasm: yeah!
[05:34] <nox-Hand> correct
[05:34] <Pici> !paste > z
[05:34] <eagles0513875> !ntfs-3g
[05:34] <ubotu> ntfs-3g is is a Linux driver which allows read/write access to NTFS partitions. It has been extensively tested but please remember to keep backups of critical data. Installation instructions at http://lunapark6.com/?p=1710 (Dapper) and http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=217009/ (Edgy)
[05:34] <Attis> Ferrix, did you use that one set of instructions for 8.35.5 because it worked fine for me.
[05:34] <Angel-SL> does FeistyLAMP have GD?!!!
[05:34] <Dr_willis> jube,  this is an external usb drive?
[05:35] <Pici> z: None of those are official repositories.
[05:35] <Krazytekn0>  z please use a pastebin
[05:35] <Ferrixman> Attis, yes
[05:35] <jube> Dr willis. nope it's just on my hard drive
[05:35] <fiestyfoe> disasm it said: /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure must be run as root
[05:35] <tokyoahead> guys I triedt o change the screen resoltion and installed the 915resolution driver, it lists the mode but they do not appear in the dropdown in the settings... any idea what I have to do ? (intel laptop graphics card)
[05:35] <Attis> The only thing I'm annoyed by was a few packages I was trying to DL last night were on servers that seem to be slow or unresponsive lol.
[05:35] <Lincoln6Echo> HELP! my X11 is borked -- complaining the the NVIDIA driver is using a different kernel API than the kernel --- is there a util that will reset it to the default VGA driver so I can get working again??
[05:35] <jube> I formated some extra space as ext3 and it automatically mounted at /media/disk
[05:35] <z> didnt know what a pastebin was, but ok, sorry, so anyway to help
[05:35] <disasm> boubbin: install nfs-kernel-server on both machines, add an entry to /etc/exports to export the nfs share, and then mount it on the other machine
[05:35] <Angel-SL> does FeistyLAMP have GD?!!!
[05:35] <Attis> Hmm Ferrixman, did you disable fglrx first?
[05:35] <mahdi> anybody knows where I can find old feisty kernels?
[05:35] <Angel-SL> !gd
[05:35] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about gd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[05:35] <Angel-SL> !lamp
[05:35] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[05:35] <boubbin> disasm: ok, thanks
[05:35] <Attis> You need to disable the standard module.
[05:35] <mahdi> or at least the linux-headers
[05:35] <joshjosh> tokyoahead, 915resolution only works for intel cards. You should just edit your xorg.conf
[05:35] <Dr_willis> jube,  thats odd. Odd that its even automounting the thing.  You could just add an entry for it in the fstab then and mount it whever you want.
[05:35] <Ferrixman> i used the exactly the same configuration i used last time... and yes, i disabled fglrx
[05:35] <Ferrixman> could it be something wrong with gpu?
[05:36] <Draconicus> Hey, I noticed that grouch.app is in Games and Amusements, but it's labeled as a GTK AIM/ICQ client... Might want to fix that.
[05:36] <Pici> z: None of those are official repositories, as such, they might not be available nor may not have files for your version.  Its not really something under Ubuntu's control.
[05:36] <disasm> boubbin: http://www.unhandledexceptions.com/tutorials/tut_11.html
[05:36] <Krazytekn0> z um I'd use the real repositories instead of those ones, probably will help at least
[05:36] <tokyoahead> joshjosh: I have an intel card. the xorg.conf shows the correct resolution. the preferences program does not do so
[05:36] <joshjosh> tokyoahead, have you restarted?
[05:36] <z> how do i use the real ones ??
[05:36] <z> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16582/, thats the pastebin
[05:36] <hmpedersen> Could my problems with resolution be missing drivers? If so, where would I find the nvidia drivers?
[05:36] <Malachi> I can't seem to start openoffice since upgrading, and fglrx no longer works.
[05:36] <tokyoahead> joshjosh: yes
[05:36] <Attis> hmpedersen, on Nvidia's site.
[05:36] <joshjosh> tokyoahead, hmm...
[05:37] <jube> dr willis, it's a logical partition inside an extended partition... I think that is something to do with it
[05:37] <Haekke> foes the server edition have a gui as standard?
[05:37] <Ferrixman> Attis, if i do: sudo glxinfo | grep direct
[05:37] <Ferrixman> direct rendering: Yes
[05:37] <Attis> No distro can claim to maintain non-open source drivers, without some pretty bad legal implication.
[05:37] <joshjosh> Tokoyoma, editing your xorg.conf should do the trick. remove your 915resolution and try again i guess
[05:37] <Attis> Hmm Ferrix weird
[05:37] <Angel-SL> anyone?
[05:37] <Angel-SL> does FeistyLAMP have GD?!!!
[05:37] <hmpedersen> Alright. thanks Attis..
[05:37] <Angel-SL> hello?
[05:37] <Dr_willis> jube,  i dont think that should matter at all. You can always tell the fstab exactly WHERE to mount the thing.
[05:37] <Haekke> does the server edition have a gui as standard?
[05:37] <Angel-SL> ANYONE?
[05:37] <z0man> How do I get my update notifier back ?
[05:38] <kde185> does anyone know how to get nm-applet to stop asking for the default keyring password on loggin?
[05:38] <Dr_willis> jube,  its defaulting to using the disks 'label' which in this case is proberly blank. so its using  the gneric 'disk'
[05:38] <tokyoahead> joshjosh: the xorg.onf showed the correct resolution since the begining, I never edited it to...
[05:38] <disasm> hmpedersen: linux-restricted-modules-generic and nvidia-glx are the two ubuntu packages you need for nvidia drivers
[05:38] <z> Krazytekn0: how do i enable the real repositories
[05:38] <disasm> hmpedersen: then run nvidia-xconfig
[05:38] <joshjosh> Tokoyoma, hmm...
[05:38] <jube> Dr willis, ok, I'll try just adding a line in fstab and remounting it to see what happens
[05:38] <ZeZu> is automatix like easyubuntu or smth ?
[05:38] <kiryn> Krazytekn0 how do I restart X without restarting pc?
[05:38] <tatters> You know, dropping by here to see what Ubuntu is all about,, could  leave one with the impression nothing works
[05:38] <fiestyfoe> disasm i got: /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure must be run as root
[05:38] <Angel-SL> IS anyone going to help me???
[05:38] <fiestyfoe> what does that mean
[05:38] <disasm> hmpedersen: if you're running feisty, apparently there is some new graphical thing to add drivers in the admin menu
[05:38] <disasm> fiestyfoe: sudo
[05:38] <z> kiryn: ctrl+alt+backspace
[05:38] <cables> I have this problem where the master volume and headphone volumes are separate. I want to make Master control them all. Someone here helped me with that a long time ago, but I lost the instructions and I just did i clean install of Feisty. Can anyone help me?
[05:39] <Jef2> Hi  Anyone having trouble with Realtec cards after upgrade?
[05:39] <joshjosh> tokyoahead, I have no clue. I use nvidia drivers so I have no idea.
[05:39] <kiryn> thank you z
[05:39] <SlimeyPete> Jef2: sound?
[05:39] <z> np
[05:39] <Pici> !automatix > ZeZu
[05:39] <tokyoahead> joshjosh: well thanks anyhow
[05:39] <Keldoor> I am installing a vidio driver and it says i need to be root... when I use su command...  says i can't athenticate me.. I use my root password?
[05:39] <kleftisx> any way to install xgl? i have completly remove it and now i cant find it to install it again.
[05:39] <joshjosh> Tokoyoma, If you don't mind the possiblity of a broken system you could try automatix i guess...
[05:39] <fiestyfoe> disasm: I don't know what that means
[05:39] <Jef2> No  wireless
[05:39] <Dr_willis> Keldoor,  use sudo command
[05:39] <SlimeyPete> Keldoor: use sudo, there is no su in ubuntu (by default)
[05:39] <Pici> z: Remove any manually entered repositories from your /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:39] <disasm> fiestyfoe: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[05:39] <magnetron> !sudo > Keldoor
[05:39] <Lincoln6Echo> HELP! my X11 is borked -- complaining the the NVIDIA driver is using a different kernel API than the kernel --- is there a util that will reset it to the default VGA driver so I can get working again??
[05:39] <Ferrixman> Attis, are you there?
[05:39] <disasm> fiestyfoe: sudo runs a command as root
[05:39] <Angel-SL> Dr_willis: does Feisty LAMP have GD??
[05:39] <z> pici: alright
[05:39] <z> thanks
[05:39] <Hohlraum> anyone know how to enable edge resistance when desktop effects are enabled?
[05:39] <Woody_> people, how can i upgrade to Ubuntu 7.04, i already have the CD of 7.04
[05:39] <Attis> Ferrixman, yeah
[05:40] <Dr_willis> Angel-SL,  no clue.  not even sure what you mean by 'GD"
[05:40] <Crane_> Angel-SL: What is GD
[05:40] <Angel-SL> LibGD
[05:40] <Ferrixman> i have no clue, what can i do?
[05:40] <hanzomon4> @cables, you need to use the softvol alsa plugin
[05:40] <Angel-SL> !libgd
[05:40] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about libgd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi

[05:40] <magnetron> Woody_ , do yo have the desktop or the alternate cd?
[05:40] <Malachi> I can't seem to start openoffice since upgrading, and fglrx no longer works. Any help?
[05:40] <Angel-SL> phpinfo says the opposite!
[05:40] <hmpedersen> diasm, yeah I am.. The past several Ubuntus have been unable to run.. 5.10 worked like a charm.. 6.06 and 6.10 didn't
[05:40] <aurel86> how can I run commands automaticaly on startup?
[05:40] <kde185> Does anyone know how to get nm-applet to stop asking for the default keying on login(running feisty)
[05:40] <disasm> Woody_: assuming you have the live cd, you can't without a reinstall, if you have the alternate cd, there should be a command apt-cd or something
[05:40] <Woody_> magnetron: im not sure
[05:40] <valerie> i have a problem with wine when i do wine dvdshrink.exe i get an error from wine telling me "set up was unable to create the directory " C:Windows\is-BTU2T.temp"  error 3. path not found

[05:40] <orangefly> how do you find your video card brand....???....

[05:40] <cables> hanzomon4, can you explain that to me?
[05:40] <Woody_> ah disasm
[05:40] <nox-Hand> mc44: Even when booting through root=/dev/hda1 it hangs at same spot so it's not uuid ?
[05:41] <disasm> hmpedersen: so whats the problem, resolution to small? no video acceleration?
[05:41] <Jef2> had realtec wireless card working in 6.10...disappeared in 7
[05:41] <MFen> congrats on the release!  Anyone know where I can get a LiveCD?  either 6.10 or 7.04 would be fine, the website search is down
[05:41] <hanzomon4> @cables, I'm not sure how to set it up but do a google search, or ubuntuforums search
[05:41] <cables> MFen, ubuntu.com and click the download link
[05:41] <magnetron> Woody_ , if it is the alternate cd. you can just pop it in when edgy is running, it will update you r system
[05:41] <begleysm> i dunno, resolution should be 1280x1024... my xorg.conf has Depth 24 Modes "1280x1024" for all 3 entries
[05:41] <Dr_willis> MFen,  that DisrtoWatch web site perhaps.
[05:41] <orangefly> how do you find your video card brand....???....
[05:41] <hmpedersen> diasm, I have a widescreen monitor.. Only resolutions I get are 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768
[05:41] <pope523> Is there an issue with running X on Ubuntu on Sparcs?
[05:41] <Woody_> disasm: im already in ubuntu 7.04 beta, can't i upgrade it without the Live CD? it uses the online server i mean
[05:41] <kothz> anyone know an easy way to get a jre 1.3.x plugin for firefox?
[05:41] <Dr_willis> orangefly,  try 'lspci'

[05:41] <cables> hanzomon4, when the guy helped me, he didn't have to help me install a plugin. I'll just ask again another time
[05:41] <disasm> hmpedersen: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[05:42] <orangefly> dr willis.... ty....same for laptop....???....
[05:42] <Dr_willis> jube,  i still tend to use /dev/whatever for hd's that dont move around.
[05:42] <hanzomon4> @cables It's a setting in the /etc/asound.conf not a traditional plugin
[05:42] <shockent> I did a fresh install of Feisty, and none of my OpenOffice apps have icons -- is this fixable?
[05:42] <vtx> anybody use ubuntu on notebook ? all ok ?
[05:42] <disasm> Woody_: yeah, dist-upgrade will upgrade you to the latest
[05:42] <cables> hanzomon4, ok, i'll google it :)
=== Insurgent is now known as Huffalump2
[05:42] <disasm> Woody_: if you've upgraded recently, you probably don't have many packages to install
[05:42] <Woody_> ahhhh alright :D disasm
[05:42] <Woody_> thanks a lot
[05:42] <hmpedersen> diasm, I did.. Before that I also had 1280x768.. Now all I have are the three aforementioned resolutions..
[05:43] <jube> Dr Willis, Roger. I'll give it a shot
[05:43] <acidtabs> Can anyone help to install Sauerbraten??
[05:43] <d3rzelle> hia
[05:43] <hmpedersen> No matter how many times I readd other resolutions, they are removed once I try and change to them
[05:43] <qaldune> acidtabs just download it from the webpage
[05:43] <Dr_willis> !info Sauerbraten
[05:43] <ubotu> Package sauerbraten does not exist in feisty
[05:43] <qaldune> acidtabs it's not in repositories
[05:43] <Dr_willis> acidtabs,  heh - not tried that yet.
[05:43] <Keldoor> where do i get  binutils at?
[05:43] <disasm> hmpedersen: you gotta type my name right so I see the things scroll by as many people are in here ;-)
[05:43] <acidtabs> i did dl uzip it but wat know
[05:44] <sand_storm> hi , can anyone tell me how i can instal ubuntu but not remove windows, i have a 80gb hd devided into 2 partions
[05:44] <ZeZu> !synaptic > Keldoor
[05:44] <Dr_willis> acidtabs,  read the install docs? you may just need to run the game binary ./whatever
[05:44] <LjL> !dualboot > sand_storm    (sand_storm, see the private message from Ubotu)
[05:44] <disasm> hmpedersen: in that step, there is resolution list, there should be a bunch you can choose frome, mark them with a *
[05:44] <hmpedersen> disasm ahh.. I never noticed that first s..
[05:44] <acidtabs> i read it but don't understand it

[05:44] <ApesMa> Running Edgy Eft; upgrade via update-manager failed, apparently because of problems w/tomcat5.5 and apache2. It appears to have backed out mostly (though /etc/apt/sources.list now points at Feisty repositories), and I've removed tomcat5.5 and apache2. I'm now told there are 1581 updates (presumably those are Feisty Fawn). Should I just tell synaptic to mark all updates and install?
[05:44] <Shrimpy_> hello, what is the command for the x-org server thingy to mess with your ressolution
[05:44] <disasm> hmpedersen: hint: tab completion works in most irc client, ie, i type hmp<TAB>
[05:44] <MFen> Dr_willis: any idea how i would find it on distrowatch? it doesn't yield to a simple search

[05:45] <MFen> cables: i think this is gonna be the install cd, not the livecd
[05:45] <acidtabs> i was also having probs with that lol

[05:45] <Lepht> First time here. Looking for 7.04 partition interface help.
[05:45] <disasm> hmpedersen: and also tell me your native resolution for your monitor
[05:45] <Dr_willis> http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=04178
[05:45] <hmpedersen> disasm one moment..
[05:45] <jptix__> is 'apt-get autoremove' under any circumstance a bad idea? i see it wants to get rid of stuff like 'gnome-bin', 'gnome-libs-data', which sound important to me...
[05:45] <LjL> sand_storm: the specifics of where buttons and things are might be slightly different, i doubt all the documentation has been updated yet. but in general yes, it's absolutely the same
[05:46] <hmpedersen> disasm, the native res is 1440x900
[05:46] <sand_storm> Thank you
[05:46] <LjL> sand_storm: you just need to install Ubuntu on the spare partition (or if you need to keep both partitions for other uses, the installer can shrink them and make some space by itself; it's an option during installation)
[05:46] <nox-Hand> Can someone help me get my Ubuntu booting
[05:46] <MFen> Dr_willis: ty
[05:46] <LjL> sand_storm: do you need to keep in mind that resizing partitions is always potentially dangerous, though
[05:46] <disasm> nox-Hand: what seems to be the problem?
[05:46] <nox-Hand> disasm: There is no aparrent error and anything from -13 kernel and down boots. All over hangs for a while and then goes to busybox.
[05:46] <LjL> sand_storm: s/do you/you do/
[05:47] <sand_storm> i dont need to resize it
[05:47] <Shrimpy_> LjL: do i need to restart afterwards?
[05:47] <kiryn> w00t
[05:47] <sand_storm> i will use the other 40
[05:47] <kiryn> I got 1280x1024 now yaya
[05:47] <LjL> Shrimpy_: restart X, yes. you can do it by hitting Ctrl+Alt+Backspace (it won't ask any question and just restart it abruptly)
[05:47] <disasm> nox-Hand: any errors in dmesg?
[05:47] <nox-Hand> disasm: Where do I check? o_O
[05:47] <Shrimpy_> LjL: tahnks again
[05:47] <disasm> nox-Hand: dmesg
[05:48] <kiryn> hey disasm that thing screwed up my xorg.conf :\
[05:48] <Woody_> I believe that the ubuntu 7.04 final was released on the 15th not on the 19th. but it was official on the 19th. because there were lots of updates/upgrades after the 15th of April and some of the .iso were posted on the 15th.
[05:48] <nox-Hand> disasm: BusyBox does not have that command
[05:48] <hmpedersen> disasm: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16586/

[05:49] <mdub> ah, was trying to update apt-get
[05:49] <soundray> Huffalump2: the real solution is probably to load the nvidia-legacy module at boot instead of nvidia
[05:49] <disasm> kiryn: ok, try this, sudo Xorg -configure   then edit /root/xorg.conf and change mouse to /dev/input/mice, then copy that config (after making backups of all previous configs) to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[05:49] <Dr_willis> LjL,  perhaps they all got used up. :) heh heh... odd.. that does sound like a dns server issue.

[05:59] <h0ax> Woody_:  just dont use exe on linux fullstop
[05:59] <holycow> gizmo_the_great1, well you can package it your self.  or just download the .gz file, extract and click on the binary
[05:59] <holycow> it just runs

[06:00] <Rkyraccoon55> soundray: i cant see my shared folder on my other computer
[06:00] <soundray> Zenek: 'sudo apt-get --reinstall install package', but it's not a good way to solve problems.
[06:00] <gizmo_the_great1> holycow: yeah, I know but I was hoping to have it installed properly - last time is compiled from source I nearly screwed up my dependancy tree!
[06:00] <csmanx> gizmo_the_great1: ok, I got 'boot:' BUT , the iso doesn't have a rescue image o_O
[06:00] <sorcerer> soundray: why would i use such commnands like that ?
[06:00] <h0ax> Woody_:  linux is a completaly different operating system ... windows is bollocks
[06:00] <soundray> sorcerer: why not?
[06:00] <holycow> gizmo_the_great1, just extract from gzip then and run it like that. no bigie
[06:00] <Woody_> DSpair: if you can't use the .exe, then what can we use? most of the softwares i use are .exe

[06:01] <Huffalump2> Woody_ AutoCAD is a whole 'nother monster.
[06:01] <Woody_> Huffalump2: h0ax is telling me not to use it, since it eats up lots of resources
[06:01] <gizmo_the_great1> Woody_: with extreme difficulty I expect!

[06:01] <LjL> jago25_98: 3.5.6
[06:01] <DSpair> Woody_: Take a look at http://freshmeat.net. That site is FULL of software for Linux/Unix, and there are replacements for most of your Windows EWXE files there.
[06:01] <sorcerer> soundray:  i dunno iam asking . how can this be usful like example .

[06:01] <blekos_> hi, i have kubuntu installed but want to install ubuntu as well how can i do that?

[06:03] <gizmo_the_great1> Woody_: i would be very surprised if WINE will cope with AutoCAD
[06:03] <ChosenOne> hello
[06:03] <Huffalump2> Woody_ DSpair is definitely correct in saying you should replace everything you can with Linux software instead.  In my experiences, that's gold widsom.
[06:03] <vox754> MFen, wa?
[06:03] <jago25_98> LjL, thanks, I guess it must be here already and just a case of running it
[06:03] <bgrupe> MFen: what do you mean? the desktop cds are live cds
[06:03] <LjL> MFen: the "Desktop CD" (the main CD you find on the site) *is* a live CD. since Dapper.
[06:03] <DSpair> Woody_: www.vmware.com
[06:03] <Huffalump2> wisdom, even
[06:03] <gizmo_the_great1> Woody_: but if it does, bravo
[06:03] <kothz> anyone tried to install the 1.3.1 JRE on Firefox 2?
[06:03] <magnetron> !mirrors > MFen
[06:03] <gizmo_the_great1> Woody_: hang on - i iwll get the URKL
[06:03] <Woody_> thanks DSpair
[06:03] <Woody_> i hope that gizmo_the_great1 :)
[06:03] <MFen> LjL: OH.
[06:03] <ChosenOne> i downloaded and burned the feisty cd, but it has no cdromupgrade-file on it, like said at http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading - what am I to do now? online-upgrade?
[06:03] <WaxyFresh> where would be a good place for asking advacned wifi questions on irc?
[06:03] <MFen> well what the heck, nobody ever told me that :)
[06:03] <esperegu> Woody_: the player is in packages...
[06:03] <Lepht> First time here. Looking for partition support. I am confused on whether if I should reformat fat32 as ext3, or resize ntfs for more ext3 room.
[06:03] <DSpair> Woody_: Yes, AUTOCAD will not run on Linux. Alternately though, there are actually better drafting solutions available for Linux for free.
[06:03] <arnold-9392> can anyone help me get Feisty to recognize a desktop PCI wireless card?
[06:04] <Woody_> DSpair: can you name me one please?
[06:04] <disasm> arnold-9392: chipset?
[06:04] <gizmo_the_great1> Woody_: http://www.vmware.com/products/free_virtualization.html
[06:04] <esperegu> Hi guys... I try to upgrade to 7.04 but I get an error: "ConfigParser.NoSectionError: No section: 'View' " any ideas??
[06:04] <LjL> MFen: it's a live CD with a graphical installer. the old "installation" CD still exist and is called "Alternate CD", it gives you some more options and can work on lower end systems.
[06:04] <tikka> anyone got skype working with 64bit build of ubuntu ? (amd)
[06:04] <DSpair> Woody_: It's been a while. Let me look it up for you.
[06:04] <southafrikanse> Hello is crimsun here?
[06:04] <velko> Lepht: are you registered? if so you can pm me and i will explain you the options you have
[06:04] <park13> i did an upgrade to 7.04 and now i getting this error on boot up bin sh can t access tty job control turned offbin sh can t access tty job control turned off
[06:04] <arnold-9392> disasm: nVidia nForce2 SPP
[06:04] <Woody_> gizmo_the_great1: thank you bro/sis
[06:04] <Marupa> heya, everyone...upgrading to 7.04, watching the terminal, and something weird is going on, all the 'h's are missing.
[06:05] <WaxyFresh> where would be a good place for asking advacned wifi questions on irc?
[06:05] <MrMakeveli> hey guys where can i post a screenshot to show you what my problem is?
[06:05] <gizmo_the_great1> Woody_: definatly bro ;-)

[06:05] <MrMakeveli> drew, lol not image shack. theres a pastebin here or on ubuntu.com
[06:05] <MonsieurBon> hello
[06:05] <Woody_> Huffalump2: thanks
[06:05] <ScreaminIke> so... the usual fix for X screen resolutions... injecting the one you actually want... doesn't work for me. for whatever reason, when i do it... it displays way out of my range. the monitor will not show anything except an error message about the res. i KNOW this monitor can handle 1280x1024, so why isn't it?
[06:05] <Huffalump2> There are more than one, readily available for free.  They have different features and UIs.  You'll have to evaluate them for your needs, Woody_
[06:05] <DSpair> Woody_: Have a look at http://www.tech-edv.co.at/lunix/CADlinks.html
[06:05] <h0ax> does anyone know the apt-get kismet command ?
[06:05] <spikeb> gizmo_the_great1, ubuntu. seems shuttleworth wants a variant that's super duper free heh
[06:05] <arnold-9392> disasm: no, that's the motherboard chipset. one second
[06:05] <drew> MrMakeveli, screenshot? or paste code?

[06:06] <Woody_> thanks Huffalump2 and DSpair you guys rock!
[06:06] <spikeb> gizmo_the_great1, speech.
[06:06] <MonsieurBon> is it a problem to keep the configs from edgy for feisty? I'm thinking of a complete new installation with the old /home
[06:06] <tikka> $ arch
[06:06] <tikka> x86_64
[06:06] <MrMakeveli> drew, whoops you are right. i'll just go put it in my photobucket real quick
[06:06] <julian> how do you point ./configure to gcc 4.1.2
[06:06] <tikka> how can i change the arch to 32bit and upgrade world?
[06:06] <gizmo_the_great1> spikeb: dunno matey :-)
[06:06] <LjL> !gnewsense | spikeb, not sure if it's what you're thinking about but
[06:06] <ubotu> spikeb, not sure if it's what you're thinking about but: gNewSense is a GNU/Linux distribution based off Ubuntu with the aim of containing only free software. The Website is http://www.gnewsense.org  -  Support in #gnewsense, NOT #ubuntu
[06:06] <soundray> MonsieurBon: keep the old configs for reference. Don't just blindly copy them over.
[06:06] <spikeb> LjL, not the same there.
[06:06] <southafrikanse> I installed Ubuntu 7.04 but Windows XP vanished!
[06:06] <spikeb> LjL, er, same thing.
[06:07] <Woody_> guys, i got a prompt window 2 minutes ago saying that a person wants to connect to my computer and make a desktop sharing (i forgot). what is that? and how can i do that?
[06:07] <spikeb> LjL, but he's going to be talking to those guys :)
[06:07] <Marupa> Any ideas on what would be causing the 'h's to be missing?
[06:07] <gizmo_the_great1> southafrikanse: thats a good thing!!! lol
[06:07] <Marupa> h and -, I think.
[06:07] <Pici> spikeb: I dont beleive that anything beyond Mark Shuttleworth mentioning it in the Gutsy Gibbon release info has been announced.
[06:07] <LjL> southafrikanse: maybe you told the installer to "erase the entire disk", when prompted? that would explain it.
[06:07] <spikeb> Pici, that's what i thought. okie dokie.
[06:07] <southafrikanse> LjL: No
[06:07] <MrMakeveli> you guys know how the shutdown button and date are in the uper right corner? do anyone of you know why it would shift a few inches over so that there is a space there?
[06:07] <gizmo_the_great1> southafrikanse: i was joking....just insert your Windows CD, enter recovery mode, and run FIXMBR - you'll lose your Linux setup but you'll have Windows back
[06:07] <julian> anyone know how to point ./configure to different gcc
[06:08] <joshritger> Why wont ubuntu recognize my mouse when booting from the install cd in a virtual pc?
[06:08] <LjL> julian:  export CC=gcc-3.4  (for example) before typing ./configure
[06:08] <Marupa> MrMakeveli, right click, hit move.
[06:08] <MonsieurBon> soundray, could I do a dist-upgrade first, and then do a new installation and keep the configs? They should be feisty compatible by then, shouldn't they?
[06:08] <arnold-9392> diasm & soundray: d-link dwl-g510 is the make and model, and lspci doesn't seem to offer any insight (i don't think, I may be interpreting it incorrectly)
[06:08] <hanzomon4> southafrikanse: It could just be missing from the grub bootloader
[06:08] <julian> il try that
[06:08] <LjL> julian: if you already typed ./configure, you might need to  make distclean  or even recreate the directory
[06:08] <MrMakeveli> Marupa, i tried that, it wont let me because those are fixed
[06:08] <arnold-9392> disasm & soundray: d-link dwl-g510 is the make and model, and lspci doesn't seem to offer any insight (i don't think, I may be interpreting it incorrectly)
[06:08] <soundray> spikeb: take a look at gnewsense, I think that's what it's going to be built on
[06:08] <gizmo_the_great1> joshritger: is it a USB mouse?

[06:12] <southafrikanse> vox754: I didn't
[06:12] <Huffalump2> Woody_ on a tangent, one thing you'll want to get used to is using (menu navigation) System > Administration > Synaptic.  That will tell you what software is available to be installed as well as what is actually installed.  From there you can install/uninstall, find new softare, et al.
[06:12] <DSpair> Woody_: It's part of ubuntu.
[06:12] <southafrikanse> vox754: I'm sure of that
[06:13] <disasm> southafrikanse: isn't that what it's supposed to do?
[06:13] <Pici> Marupa: Thats very odd.  Perhaps your terminal encoding got set to something weird before the upgrade?

[06:17] <ubotu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)

[06:19] <soundray> Rkyraccoon55: do you want to transfer a few files just this once, or do you want this sharing path open for the longer term?
[06:19] <LjL> sorcerer: uh, redirecting has nothing to do with any program (cat, or sort) specifically. *every* program has a so-called "standard input" and a "standard output". they're usually bound to a terminal (the Linux console, or your GNOME terminal) if you start them from there. by using ">" and "<", you simply instruct the shell to redirect stdout or stdin (respectively) to someplace else (like a file)

[06:20] <LjL> sorcerer: so if a program - like "sort" expects input to come from the standard input (the keyboard, you could say), you can make it come from somewhere else (like a file) by using  sort <filename . and conversely, if "sort" output stuff to standard output (i.e. the screen, normally), you can make it output to a file with  sort >filename

[06:21] <voraistos> LjL: it seems it is the same bug. there are in fact multiple bug reports about this overheating issue. the problem is that in many cases, the computer doesnt power off, it just burns itself down.

[06:21] <Improved> Nope
[06:22] <Improved> Its from official site.

[06:22] <soundray> Rkyraccoon55: if you can bear using the command line, the best way is to set up sshd on one of the machines (sudo apt-get install ssh) and use 'scp -r /path/to/music user@host' to transfer files from the other machine to the sshd one
[06:22] <voraistos> LjL: i think it would be VERY wise to tell people on the website before to Dl or on the IRC channel title. Many people (on the forum) actually destroyed brand new hardware, and no one does anything about it !
[06:22] <Afief> improved are you on windows now?
[06:22] <sorcerer> LjL:  ok well in a real world example how would you use sort ?
[06:22] <Improved> yes

[06:23] <PriceChild> voraistos, "destroyed"?
[06:23] <erUSUL> sorcerer: sort is for sorting... man sort
[06:23] <disasm> Malder: well... yes and know, you need to setup a mail server to route it, and then you could add root: myemail@somewhere.com to /etc/aliases and run new aliases, but the hard part is setting up a mail server
[06:23] <voraistos> PriceChild: yep.
[06:23] <S1K3S> magnetron: nope, its an integrated intel card in a toshiba notebook

[06:23] <PriceChild> voraistos, define destroyed
[06:23] <Huffalump2> soundray, I may have overlooked a reply some time ago.  With respect to nvidia-new, nvidia, nvidia-legacy, and nv.... are these variables in the xorg.conf directly related to the modules nvidia-glx-legacy, nvidia-glx, and nvidia-glx-new, respectively?  I wanted to understand if there was a correlation.
[06:23] <voraistos> PriceChild: graphic card and processor cores burned down to hell.
[06:23] <LjL> sorcerer: in a real word example, i'd use it to sort things. if i have a list of numbers (numbers.txt) and i want them to be sorted numerically from smallest to biggest, i'd type  sort -n numbers.txt > numbers2.txt 
[06:23] <Improved> Afief, so where i should check that md5 checksum ? - Will it solve my burning problem ?
[06:23] <Improved> I'v downloaded that iso twice, same error.
[06:23] <LjL> sorcerer: what about typing  man sort , wouldn't that clarify some issues?
[06:23] <PriceChild> voraistos, that won't be ubuntu's fault

[06:24] <Dr_willis> PriceChild,  i agree with you there.
[06:24] <voraistos> PriceChild: thankfully my laptop is very well cooled and the processor is capped at 600 mhz, because of the battery life, so the dammage is not important on mine, i just lost 1gig of ram.

[06:26] <S1K3S> magnetron: I'm running 6.06 server right now and was going to upgrade to 7.04. Since you can only upgrade from >6.10, I downloaded and burned the ISO and could not get my laptop to boot into the install. However, the 6.06 install disk still boots into it
[06:26] <S1K3S> so I'm thinking bad iso
[06:26] <Improved> afief, could we join another channel -> That you could post me ? -> Becouse here's so many chat...
[06:26] <soundray> Rkyraccoon55: did you then choose nfs or smb?

[06:27] <jrib> !doesn't work | brunoUT
[06:27] <ubotu> brunoUT: Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[06:27] <LjL> brunoUT: "those"? which "those"? there's like 30 different mirrors listed to chose among, there
[06:28] <soundray> Rkyraccoon55: on the other side, did you try Places-Connect to server?
[06:28] <spikeb> ubotu, haha
[06:28] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about haha - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[06:28] <LjL> brunoUT: i'm using the swedish ones. se.archive.ubuntu.com. they are listed.
[06:28] <PriceChild> voraistos, not that I totally believe your story... have you done so much as to file a bug?
[06:28] <Huffalump2> soundray, by specifying nvidia in xorg, it will automagically get the correct module (which is then probably the only one installed because I think they mutually exclude each other, if I understood what I read on the commandline)
[06:28] <Rkyraccoon55> soundray: no, i did not
[06:28] <S1K3S> anyone know? Ubuntu with intel macs?
[06:28] <brunoUT> LjL: you helped me earlier....but they still time out
[06:28] <soundray> Rkyraccoon55: oh, I'm just seeing that that doesn't give you an NFS option.
[06:28] <Huffalump2> S1K3s, sure.  and PPC, too.
[06:28] <Rkyraccoon55> soundray: oh
[06:28] <voraistos> PriceChild: I havent filed a bug since other people did before me, i just added my logs to the bugs, so the kernel team can see whats going on
[06:29] <S1K3S> excellent
[06:29] <PriceChild> voraistos, that's something thanks
[06:29] <spikeb> voraistos, good job :)

[06:31] <sorcerer> iam soo confused ..
[06:32] <LjL> sorcerer: ah sorry i missed that. well, what you did was 1) run the command "who", which lists logged in users, but instead of listing them on the screen, you redirected the list to the "names.txt" file    3) then you called "sort" on that names.txt files, resulting in a sorted list of users.
[06:32] <voraistos> PriceChild: look at this thread, many people had the same problem. Could you just say a word about it in the #ubuntu channel topic please ?

[06:38] <Keldoor> PriceChild... in System > Administration ...... there isn't a Restricted Manager ... option
[06:38] <PriceChild> jessid, 1. does it not work automatically? 2. Does it come with a readme file?

[06:47] <derek_> PriceChild,  sorry
[06:47] <nach0s> All, i have a compaq evo 160 notebook, and im trying to install ubuntu 7.04 but i get this error "bin/sh: can't access tty: job control turned off" And nothings happend...  i cant install the ubuntu on this laptop.. any ideia what is it?? Regards!! IS THERE A BUG ?
[06:47] <babo> what about a good regex tester ? ...
[06:47] <eck> Shau1: yes, you can use ldap or kerberos or pretty much any other schema you like using PAM
[06:47] <nexeus> well i dont know the entries
[06:47] <Shaffox> how do i mount my usb stick ?
[06:47] <hacked_kernel> I have Feisty Fawn, the Work spaces on a cube was working perfectly but after a while it is not working now
[06:47] <narf__> soundray, Laizerox: something about busybox
[06:47] <cables> Are there any disadvantages to using mirrors besides main if they're faster?
[06:47] <dannyc_> babo, you can write a regex tester in like two seconds with your language of choice
[06:47] <narf__> I've got the same error
[06:47] <LjL> Shaffox: you should be able to just plug it in
[06:47] <soundray> csmanx: please describe the problem from the beginning
[06:47] <ZeZu> wow, my root partition just got screwed by adding another hdd
[06:47] <Laizerox> narf__: YEs
[06:47] <LjL> cables: no
[06:48] <MadDog011> erUSUL, NVIDIA says I should use the NON LEGACY but wehn I put non legacy on, the XORG says oh no u picked the wrong driver m8 u need the LEGACY :)
[06:48] <cables> LjL, ok
[06:48] <spikeb> spikeb, maybe
[06:48] <ZeZu> fsck get all sorts of errors, supposedly lfixed, and now dpkg is broken
[06:48] <mrmonday> My feisty upgrade failed! :(
[06:48] <ZeZu> and i get other interesting errors
[06:48] <Shaffox> LjL, yeah , i know, but i'd like to know how to mount it with the commandline
[06:48] <nexeus> eck:  well i dont know the entries
[06:48] <Shau1> sorry for being such a noob, but what is LDAP and kerberos?
[06:48] <mrmonday> see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/108172
[06:48] <dannyc_> shaul, look on goolge/wikipedia
[06:48] <eck> Shau1: have you used AD in windows?
[06:48] <Laizerox> BusyBox v1.01 (Debian 1:1.01-4ubuntu3) Built-in shell (ash)
[06:48] <Laizerox> /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
[06:48] <nexeus> eck,   well i dont know the entries
[06:48] <csmanx> soundray: have a disabled ubuntu install , need to rewrite mbr so I can boot. you said grub has a recovery option. If this is correct, how do I get to grub? my guess is using a live user(live dvd) and enter grub from there
[06:48] <Shau1> eck, yea i've used AD?
[06:48] <eck> nexeus: can you mount the dapper partition?
[06:48] <MadDog011> erUSUL, now im in the legacy...
[06:48] <Laizerox> soundray: BusyBox v1.01 (Debian 1:1.01-4ubuntu3) Built-in shell (ash), /bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
[06:48] <cables> !grub | csmanx
[06:48] <erUSUL> MadDog011: legacy driver does not support aiglx (default in xorg for composite) iirc you will need to use xgl
[06:48] <ubotu> csmanx: grub is the default Ubuntu boot manager. Lost grub after installing windows: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows - Making GRUB floppies & other GRUB howtos: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GrubHowto
[06:48] <derek_> PriceChild,   do you have any idea ?
[06:49] <soundray> Laizerox: and before that even?
[06:49] <jshriver> csmanx: reboot press escape when it asks for boot menu, that's grub
[06:49] <Araiwa> hi, i just installed xubuntu 7.04, but it fails to boot up. i got error /bin/sh: can't access tty
[06:49] <nexeus> eck, already mounted
[06:49] <jshriver> lol seems like a lot of people are having feisty problems
[06:49] <MadDog011> erUSUL, but man I used to be able to get beryl to work.. I have NVIDIA ti 4200 ...
[06:49] <Laizerox> soundray: nothing before that happens boot :/
[06:49] <narf__> soundray: before that is just the splash screen
[06:49] <eck> Shau1: AD is the Microsoft implementation of LDAP. it's possible to set up AD on windows and have linux integrate with the AD system you have set up, but it's a fair amount of work
[06:49] <Dr_willis> Araiwa,  seeing several people with simile rissues like that today.. not seen a fix yet.
[06:49] <cmcculloh> !tell cmcculloh about file sharing
[06:49] <fuffalo-> everytime i mark something as junk it goes to the junk folder, but when i re-open evolution it's back in my inbox..what am i doing wrong? any ideas?  (i'm connecting to an exchange server)
[06:49] <MadDog011> erUSUL, I don't think that card is non legacy...
[06:49] <chapium> hey all, I haven't used ubuntu in a while
[06:49] <csmanx> jshriver: you mean 'boot:' is grub?
[06:49] <LjL> Laizerox, Araiwa: perhaps https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/initramfs-tools/+bug/96084
[06:49] <jshriver> cables: yes
[06:49] <chapium> does the install disk act as a live cd?
[06:49] <narf__> soundray: in recovery mode, before that is 'Waiting for root file system.'
[06:49] <ad> so i installed dhcp3-server, i have to start it via:/etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start how can i add it to a runlevel so i have it up at boot time?
[06:49] <magnetron> ubuntu: you need an empty partition for installing to, which is to be called /.
[06:49] <jshriver> csmanx: yes rather
[06:49] <soundray> csmanx: yes. Was it Windows that wrecked your mbr?
[06:50] <csmanx> soundray: yup
[06:50] <nexeus> eck, its already mounted
[06:50] <DrNick1> what's the minimum spec hardware anyone would recommend installing Ubuntu on? yes, i know about Xubuntu, but just wondering the minimum spec people think for Ubuntu for a basic internet/word-processing machine for someone.  think a 600Mhz PC w/ 192MB RAM should just about cut it?
[06:50] <soundray> csmanx: ubotu will send you a private msg
[06:50] <jago25_98> What's the best USB WIFI dongle to choose? -linux compatible, external ariel
[06:50] <eck> nexeus: so all you need to do is put in the correct kernel and initrd names
[06:50] <csmanx> k
[06:50] <soundray> !grub > csmanx
[06:50] <Araiwa> oh dear, it is not a nice release then. :(
[06:50] <eck> nexeus: you can get those by looking at /boot on the dapper partition
[06:50] <rolands> Is the kernel different in 7.04 my scsi drives aren't regonised anymore, neither is my card mind that?
[06:50] <ubuntu> magnetron: i shouldn't need an empty partition... i should need a partition with enough space... which I would mount as /
[06:50] <jshriver> csmanx: you have to intall windows first then linuix... windows is a pain when it comes to sharing the computer, it'll rewrite your MBR.. but there are other ways around it using a live CD, but best ot just install Windows then Linux
[06:50] <erUSUL> MadDog011: but you make it work with aiglx or with Xgl? if it's the later and you upgraded to feisty you may need to enable xgl again. i'm not sure becouse i have not upgraded yet
[06:50] <kahrytan> DrNick1: Whatever runs a compositor.
[06:50] <MadDog011> AIGLX
[06:50] <Araiwa> it is my first time trying xbuntu.
[06:50] <nexeus> ecgw, boot partition got formatted for feisty
[06:51] <magnetron> ubuntu: well this is how it works. but you could resize the old partition to make space for the new one.
[06:51] <DrNick1> kahrytan: well not really bothered about composite graphics for this machine! just a basic word processing + web browsing machine for someone
[06:51] <erUSUL> MadDog011: for aiglx you need a medern (beta) nvidia driver legacy will not do
[06:51] <soundray> !grub > jshriver, this is what ubotu says about it and what csmanx is hopefully reading now
[06:51] <ubuntu> magnetron: i really don't want more partitions...
[06:51] <Shau1> eck, so rather than using AD, could it be possible to modify GDW to lookup a username and password in a custom MySQL database and depending on the result log them in, I dnt want to implement Windows really because it is like spending money that you dnt needto - thats why linus created Linux lol
[06:51] <derek_> PriceChild, hi ,  are u still there ?
[06:51] <ubuntu> magnetron: the previous installers (including feisty beta)
[06:51] <ubuntu> allowed installing without requiring a format
[06:51] <Araiwa> any solution to the problem?
[06:51] <eck> Shau1: that is pretty easy, google for pam and mysql
[06:51] <sorcerer> LjL:  hey mate .. check this out on paste bin .. the question is pasted i mean .. i kinda got the same results kinda different could you please explain this to me iam still learning unix .. i think here is the link : http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16595/
[06:51] <kahrytan> drnick1: then your basic Socket A or 478 system be fine.
[06:52] <ubuntu> i just moved everything to a directory out of the system's way (not /var usr /boot)
[06:52] <pipeline_> hmm, livecd drops me to a "initramfs" prompt on parallels on intel imac
[06:52] <MadDog011> erUSUL, allright I just need to make this thing work then with the normal driver... everywhere it says NVIDIA 4200 Titanium is a modern card... but I get a error saying its legacy
[06:52] <ubuntu> and installed withtout formatting
[06:52] <soundray> narf__, Laizerox: do you get this when booting the Desktop CD?
[06:52] <magnetron> !final | ubuntu
[06:52] <ubotu> ubuntu: If you are running a Herd/Beta version of Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) and have been keeping it up to date, you are already running the final release version of Feisty. To make sure, type  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  in a console. If you last updated few days ago, you are on the final version.
[06:52] <arnold-9592> I'm trying to enable a restricted driver (NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver) and, using the GUI, when I click on enable, it prompts me to make sure I really want to, and then I hit enable, but the box doesn't become checked and I don't think that the driver is enabled. can anyone help?
[06:52] <Shau1> OK will do, thanks for your help eck
[06:52] <DrNick1> kahrytan: i'll give it a go and see what its like :)
[06:52] <nexeus> ecgw, boot partition got formatted for feisty  stupid of me
[06:52] <henz> i cant mount my 120gb usb disk i get mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[06:52] <eck> Shau1: you would have to edit the GDM pam module to use the pam mysql method to do authentication instead of unix auth, or whatever it is set to by default
[06:52] <nox-Hand> In the -14 and -15 kernel (the two newest upgrades) I cannot boot Ubuntu
[06:52] <henz> error: could not execute pmount
[06:52] <ubuntu> ubotu: i know that... but I want to reinstall as 32bit (i have feisty 64 installed)
[06:52] <nox-Hand> And I am told it might be because of some drivers that were removed?
[06:52] <Laizerox> soundray: i just installed the ubuntu and i get it from Dektop CD too :/
[06:52] <nox-Hand> Though I truly have no idea :(
[06:52] <julian> anyone know a repository for everything alsa?
[06:52] <henz> anyone got any suggestions?
[06:53] <sorcerer> LjL:  i did two ways like command wise .. i mean .. whats the difference betweenwhat i did and  the second way was the answer
[06:53] <chapium> can the latest version of ubuntu be used without installing it to your hard drive?
[06:53] <soundray> Laizerox: I see
[06:53] <soundray> chapium: yes, use the Desktop CD
[06:53] <magnetron> chapium: yes
[06:53] <arnold-9592> can anyone help me use the "restricted drivers" utility?
[06:53] <jago25_98> chapium, yes
[06:53] <Laizerox> soundray: and how do i get it work?
[06:53] <kahrytan> drnick: Ghz range and 512mb. And reccomended nvidia card be good.
[06:53] <jshriver> Just noticed something weird, if I double click "Wanda the Fish" I can copy those boxes, paste in terminal and it displays the english.
[06:53] <CodeLearner> Hello
[06:53] <ubuntu> I doesn't make sense to force format the disk... if i want to format, ok... but why FORCE it?
[06:53] <jshriver> so it's like Gnome is missing it's font
[06:53] <julian> Error: Could not find alsa
[06:53] <julian> Make sure to have the alsa libs and headers installed.
[06:53] <chapium> magnetron, soundray, jago25_98:  thanks
[06:54] <DrNick1> kahrytan: I really dont think they need 512MB... the recommended minimum is 256MB, and I think i'll get away with 192 for this particular machine
[06:54] <julian> those files arent present in synapitc
[06:54] <ubuntu> is there a way to invoke the text installer from the livecd?
[06:54] <soundray> Laizerox: there's no easy answer, sorry. It could be an incompatibility of your disk controller. Is it SATA? Very new?
[06:54] <LjL> sorcerer: if "grep" is fed files, it will print the filename (and a semicolon) before the matching line. that's why it happens in the first case. if it just takes stuff from the standard intput, it won't print any names (since there *is* no name)
[06:54] <jenda> is there a way to check the integrity of a burned Ubuntu 7.04 CD without restarting and booting from it?
[06:54] <DrNick1> it runs XP ok (even though it's ridden with spyware hence the change to linux) so I rekon it'll be fine
[06:54] <soundray> ubuntu: no
[06:54] <Laizerox> soundray: sata i guess :D
[06:54] <eck> jshriver: check ~/.xsession-errors
[06:54] <jenda> And where can I find the Feisty md5sums?
[06:54] <LjL> sorcerer: you can make the names go away by using the "-h" option of grep anyway
[06:54] <eck> jshriver: also, if you are in a linux console you should be fine
[06:55] <Laizerox> soundray: i don't really remember i got before working 6.06
[06:55] <kahrytan> drnick1: I like having available ram. I got 1gb because of it.
[06:55] <erUSUL> jenda: use md5sum
[06:55] <Pici> ubuntu: You'd need to run the AlternativeCD to get the text based installed.
[06:55] <voids> [acid]  still here?
[06:55] <Laizerox> soundray: and 6.10 too :/
[06:55] <DrNick1> kahrytan: yeah i know, but these people dont need uber performance ;)
[06:55] <soundray> Laizerox: okay...
[06:55] <ad> so i installed dhcp3-server, i have to start it via:/etc/init.d/dhcp3-server start how can i add it to a runlevel so i have it up at boot time?
[06:55] <vox754> jenda, are you sure you are a staffer?
[06:55] <ubuntu> Pici: i'll try the alternate.. to see if it allows me to install without a format... backing up a lot of files just for reinstalling would suck
[06:55] <radar1976> whats up with the US mirror?
[06:55] <[acid] Neatchee> voids: yup, still hre
[06:55] <jenda> erUSUL: 1) how can I use it to check a burned CD 2) where can I find the official sums
[06:55] <haffe> Hi, I am in the need of some help. My system seems a bit messed up. Every system menu shows up with squares instead of letters and the error is (gedit:6284): Pango-WARNING **: shape engine failure, expect ugly output. the offending font is 'Tahoma Bold Not-Rotated 9.599609375'
[06:55] <erUSUL> ad: 'sudo update-rc.d dhcp3-server defaults'
[06:55] <DVS01> time to go for interview for the linux admin position. =D
[06:55] <DrNick1> I have 1GB too, but i know for a fact ubuntu run's with a lot less
[06:55] <jenda> vox754: very ;)
[06:55] <kneeki> Is there a quick way to setup my mouse as a 5 button mouse? GUI method preferred =)
[06:55] <kahrytan> drnick1: but nobody likes to wait for application to load.
[06:55] <magnetron> !slow >radar1976
[06:56] <jenda> vox754: being staff doesn't require being an IT professinal - I do marketing
[06:56] <lagrimo> "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off (inittramfs)" what does this mean?? (AND what got i do?)
[06:56] <sorcerer> LjL:  well the question asked me to do something i did it in two ways is that right ?
[06:56] <ad> tx erUSUL
[06:56] <cables> There used to be a really nice Human theme for gaim Guifications, but I lost it. Does anyone know where i can get it?
[06:56] <DrNick1> kahrytan: well put it this way.  their machine has 192MB SD-RAM.  try finding SD RAM anywhere these day's.  i think it should be fine, i've run it with 256 before and its run fine
[06:56] <pipeline_> lagrimo: that's what i am getting too.... anyone know?
[06:56] <julian> Make sure to have the alsa libs and headers installed.
[06:56] <Shau1> Are there any known issues with upgrading from 6.10 to feisty with a Celeron M CPU?
[06:56] <magnetron> !mouse > kneeki
[06:56] <vox754> jenda, we are aware... welcome!
[06:56] <Araiwa> i got that as well.
[06:56] <jenda> erUSUL: the md5 howto on the wiki only gives info for .isos and for 6.10
[06:56] <kahrytan> drnick1: check out pricewatch.com
[06:56] <arnold-9592> i'm trying to install nvidia drivers, and when I try (according to the wiki) : sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common , I get Package nvidia-glx is not available, but is referred to by another package......
[06:56] <jenda> vox754: :)
[06:56] <arnold-9592> Can anyone help?
[06:56] <Huffalump2> radar1976, it turns out nobody wanted to upgrade to Feisty, so they just unplugged the Ubuntu servers
[06:57] <DrNick1> kahrytan: they dont want to spend any money.  and i dont think they should have to, as i think it'll run fine
[06:57] <effie_jayx> arnold-9592,  do you have the extra repositories enabled?
[06:57] <erUSUL> jenda: you can easily rgenerate an iso from a cd 'sudo cat /dev/cdrom > image.iso' and verify that
[06:57] <soundray> Laizerox,
[06:57] <effie_jayx> arnold-9592,  what are you using? Feisty?
[06:57] <kahrytan> drnick1: It should but maybe bit slow for my tastes.
[06:57] <arnold-9592> effie_jayx: probably not, that's a good point; and yes, i am using feisty
[06:58] <xorl> There any "Faster" ubuntu mirrors?
[06:58] <bluefox83> ok, i keep getting all kinds of repositories failing when i do an update in feisty..whats the deal folks?
[06:58] <erUSUL> jenda: i eexpect official sums to be in the official dl locations and mirrors in the same dir as the iso files
[06:58] <soundray> Laizerox, sorry, I don't really know what to advise. Install 6.10 again and upgrade? You might hit the same problem.
[06:58] <shooters> arnold-9592: Go to system -> Admin -> Software Sources...
[06:58] <DrNick1> kahrytan: yes but not being funney, it's not you we're talking about here. i think they will be happy with it
[06:58] <narf__> soundray: Laizerox left, but ... I have the same problem
[06:58] <jenda> erUSUL: is generating an .iso from the CD necessary? I only want to know if it burned correctly.
[06:58] <kahrytan> bluefox: to many people upgrading
[06:58] <effie_jayx> arnold-9592,  enable them... read more at www.ubuntuguide.org
[06:58] <entropy> hi guys

[06:58] <valehru> if I use a2enmod to enable a website eg a2enmod www.example.com how do I disable the website www.example.com?
[06:58] <eck> jenda: i think you can diff the iso against the cdrom device
[06:58] <arnold-9592> effie_jayx: right, it just slipped my mind. thanks!
[06:58] <soundray> narf__: have you had success with earlier versions, too?
[06:58] <bluefox83> kahrytan, i already upgraded, i'm just trying to update my sources...
[06:58] <uber-n00b> j ubuntu-in
[06:58] <entropy> how would I go about scheduling my updates to download at a specific time, say in 3 hours or something?
[06:58] <makkone-> hi
[06:59] <erUSUL> jenda: if you want to verify it without booting it... maybe md5suming the device file works too but i do not know for sure
[06:59] <eck> jenda: e.g. diff /dev/cdrom foo.iso
[06:59] <jenda> erUSUL: I expected them to be there too :) But didn't see them... the first time I looked. Now I do. I'm not drunk, I promise ;) ust blind

[06:59] <narf__> soundray: yes, I had no problems with earlier versions
[06:59] <innervision> hello, is there anyone using an ATI mobility radeon?
[06:59] <makkone-> innervision  i am
[06:59] <xorl> Slowwww repo's
[07:00] <kahrytan> drnick1: There is a fine line between run and usable. How long are they willing to wait for bootup and start an application.
[07:00] <lichen> so i installed feisty upgraded from edgy but i already had beryl installed from the common howtos out there.. now it would seem feisty installs all that as well, but now neither beryl nor compiz seem to work properly...
[07:00] <lichen> any ideas?
[07:00] <effie_jayx> innervision,  I am
[07:00] <innervision> makkone-: is there any way to put it in "low-energy" mode?
[07:00] <narf__> soundray: however, I didn't really complete the upgrade - my computer crashed in the middle of it and now it won't boot
[07:00] <henz> anyone?
[07:00] <eck> jenda: you might want to do diff --binary just to make sure, if diff is in text mode it will read the whole file into memory
[07:00] <makkone-> innervision  dunno :)
[07:00] <henz> mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[07:00] <henz> error: could not execute pmount
[07:00] <jenda> eck: k
[07:00] <shooters> lichen: are you using beryl-manager?
[07:00] <bluefox83> lichen, i have the same issue...i think we need to wait and let beryl catch up to what feisty is doing...
[07:00] <xorl> seriously are there any faster mirrors than the stock archive mirrors?
[07:00] <innervision> effie_jayx: maybe you had an idea on that? (low-consumption mode for the ATI)
[07:00] <bluefox83> xorl, not for upgrading
[07:00] <effie_jayx> innervision,  no sorry :S
[07:00] <xorl> this is like torture.
[07:00] <xorl> bluefox83: just regular. + updates
[07:01] <innervision> makkone-: there is a way to do that with fglrx, but I don't think there is with the open source driver
[07:01] <xorl> Not upgrading.
[07:01] <narf__> soundray: I can mount the hdd using a live cd, but I can't boot from it. if you have a solution even for downgrading I'd be happy
[07:01] <kahrytan> xorl: Trying to download iso directly?
[07:01] <lichen> well i think beryl is going to be merged back into compiz, but is compiz already at the same where it has the full functionality of beryl?
[07:01] <xorl> kahrytan: no.
[07:01] <erUSUL> henz: something is wrong with the failesystem in /dev/sda1... can you use mount in it?
[07:01] <xorl> I have it installed already (feisty)
[07:01] <lichen> shooters, and yeah... it's all scripted up to start when i do an xgl session
[07:01] <Shaffox> !mount
[07:01] <xorl> just adding apt packages takes like a century
[07:01] <ubotu> Partitioning programs: !GParted or QTParted (also "man mkfs" for formatting) - Mounting partitions in Gnome under Dapper: System -> Administration -> Disks - For Edgy, see !fstab and !DiskMounter
[07:01] <bluefox83> lichen, no it's not
[07:01] <soundray> narf__: in that case, I suggest you boot the Desktop CD, mount the root partition to /mnt and run 'sudo chroot /mnt/ bash'. Then you can complete the upgrade with 'dpkg --configure -a'
[07:01] <xorl> cause it downloads at like 10-20kb/sec
[07:01] <Shaffox> !fstab
[07:01] <entropy> soundray, thanks man :)
[07:01] <ubotu> The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[07:01] <kahrytan> xorl: I don't. I am seeding it.
[07:01] <xorl> you got a 20mb package, it's going to take a century to download.
[07:01] <narf__> soundray: thanks, I'll go that right away
[07:02] <magnetron> !slow > xorl
[07:02] <julian> where can i get the default sources list for feisty
[07:02] <kahrytan> xorl: and I am waiting for repo servers to calm down. There is no patches for edgy.
[07:02] <xorl> magnetron: thanks for that tid bit/
[07:02] <henz> erUSUL: i get mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[07:02] <Flannel> !easysource | julian
[07:02] <ubotu> julian: source-o-matic is a webpage where you can (re)generate your sources.list - http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic
[07:02] <henz> erUSUL: nvm
[07:02] <atomiku> hmmm
[07:02] <julian> thank you
[07:02] <atomiku> how can I burn an iso from livecd if I cant eject the cd rom rdrive?
[07:03] <henz> erUSUL: it says line 6 is bad in fstab
[07:03] <jenda> eck: "diff: /dev/cdrom: Input/output error" - I'm guessing that means the CD is borked, if repeated?
[07:03] <soundray> atomiku: only if you have a second drive for burning
[07:03] <erUSUL> henz: it's an ext3 fs?
[07:03] <narf__> soundray: um, only one more question - do I have to boot from the feisty live cd, or I can do it from the dapper one, for example ?
[07:03] <atomiku> soundray: NO WAY! :O
[07:03] <atomiku> I need to get 7.04 burned damnit
[07:03] <eck> jenda: check dmesg, it will say if there was a read error on the device
[07:03] <atomiku> soundray: what if i somehow eject it anwyay
[07:03] <atomiku> cause im a rebel you see
[07:03] <henz> erUSUL: whats that?
[07:03] <guillem101> meld is no longer doing syntax highlighting
[07:04] <atomiku> i did it
[07:04] <atomiku> atomiku 1 - 0 ubuntu
[07:04] <soundray> narf__: you can use any live CD.
[07:04] <henz> erUSUL: whats that?
[07:04] <innervision> ah, dammit, I'll go back to fglrx
[07:04] <narf__> soundray: ok
[07:04] <soundray> atomiku: it won't work then.
[07:04] <kahrytan> I am looking forward then my tv tuner gets linux support.
[07:04] <bluefox83> it seems to me that if you want to use another server than the main one, the reason it fails to download stuff is cus the other servers haven't finished mirroring the main one yet
[07:04] <atomiku> soundray: its still working :)
[07:04] <erUSUL> henz: please post the output of 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda' in a pastebin
[07:05] <erUSUL> !paste | henz
[07:05] <ubotu> henz: pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[07:05] <hylje> kahrytan: you get better luck with buying a tv tuner that works with linux to begin with
[07:05] <kahrytan> but this is a ATSC tuner.
[07:05] <soundray> atomiku: well, your rebel ways may pay off, let's see if you can complete the burn
[07:05] <jenda> eck: How about http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16596/
[07:05] <bluefox83> lichen, i found a neat little thing for installing beryl correctly in feisty :D
[07:05] <henz> erUSUL: i get the same as before when i do that
[07:05] <eck> jenda: i think that means that the cd drive had problems reading the cd
[07:06] <Huffalump2> my Audigy card was never found by Edgy, but works great in Feisty! :D
[07:06] <jenda> eck: ok, thx
[07:06] <kahrytan> Conexant needs to bite my shiny metal ass
[07:06] <Enselic_> Huffalump2: yay! praise Feisty! :D
[07:06] <erUSUL> henz: when you do what?

[07:06] <Shau1> HOW DO I RESTART GNOME WITHOUT HAVING TO LOG OFF?
[07:06] <Pici> !caps | Shau1

[07:07] <vox754> !language > kahrytan
[07:07] <Shau1> sorry my bad
[07:07] <Pici> Shau1: You can't.
[07:07] <bluefox83> Shau1, step 1, TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK! step 2, ctrl alt backspace
[07:07] <Valstorm2379> Need terminal command for Disk Manager
[07:07] <animimotus> Hi
[07:07] <lichen> bluefox, where? and should i still be using the restricted fglrx drivers, or is the free one just as good?
[07:07] <animimotus> http://kubuntu.com/download.php#lts <------- here is the DVD pour Kubuntu, does it exist the same for Ubuntu ?
[07:07] <Valstorm2379> How do I start disk man with terminal??
[07:07] <derek_> PriceChild, seems the version problem
[07:07] <eck> ctrl alt backspace will log you off
[07:07] <romarishi> hi
[07:07] <[acid] Neatchee> Shau1: You can restart gnome without having to reboot, but not without having to log off
[07:07] <kahrytan> vox754: not language. It's a quote. watch Futurama sometime.
[07:07] <bluefox83> lichen, just check out the link i put in your pm window :D
[07:07] <boubbin> resoltution of my login screen and virtual konsoles are 640*480, hwo to increase ?
[07:07] <magnetron> Valstorm: in terminal use mount
[07:07] <[acid] Neatchee> eck: i've found that ctrl-alt-backspace can sometimes lockup gnome
[07:07] <soundray> [acid] Neatchee: that's what he's just experiencing ;)
[07:07] <Valstorm2379> just mount?
[07:08] <henz> erUSUL: can you paste the cmd again, the spam got to me
[07:08] <vox754> kahrytan, okay, I recall, still offtopic
[07:08] <erUSUL> henz: please post the output of 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda' in a pastebin
[07:08] <magnetron> Valstorm2379: disk man is a frontend for mount and format
[07:08] <soundray> [acid] Neatchee: just gnome, or the entire machine?
[07:08] <lichen> bluefox.. i'm not seeing anything :(
[07:08] <derek_> PriceChild,  the solution with aptitude is to destage the version
[07:08] <[acid] Neatchee> !resolutoin | boubbin
[07:08] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about resolutoin - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:08] <fuffalo-> (evolution question) everytime i mark something as junk it goes to the junk folder, but when i re-open evolution it's back in my inbox..what am i doing wrong? any ideas?  (i'm connecting to an exchange server)
[07:08] <PriceChild> derek_, so you fixed it?
[07:08] <[acid] Neatchee> damnit wrong thing heh
[07:08] <Pici> [acid] Neatchee: Agreed, the suggested way is to actually /etc/init.d/gdm resart, so that it doesnt kill the gnome session.
[07:08] <Argonak> Anyone have some more ideas on proxy issues with apt-get? I have the proxy in apt.conf and bash.bashrc but stil cant connect.
[07:08] <sofia> get a life!:D
[07:08] <[acid] Neatchee> Pici: yessir
[07:09] <Valstorm2379> magno, I just would like  to format my floppy disk with Disk MAn, do you know the exact command for that??

[07:10] <voidsss> Neatchee DONE...but cannot connect with voids from wireless
[07:10] <voidsss> :)))
[07:10] <soundray> hmpedersen: linux doesn't need that. Just mount the iso
[07:10] <derek_> PriceChild, sure
=== JaeSharpZZZ is now known as JaeSharp
[07:10] <eck> hmpedersen: you can mount a .iso with the mount command
[07:10] <[acid] Neatchee> hahaha that's weird

[07:10] <hmpedersen> oh..
[07:10] <soundray> !mountiso > hmpedersen
[07:10] <Pici> !iso | hmpedersen, you dont need a special program to mount an iso, see this message:
[07:10] <ubotu> hmpedersen, you dont need a special program to mount an iso, see this message:: To mount an ISO disc image, type  sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint>  - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
[07:10] <[acid] Neatchee> it's probably because you didn't disconnect voidsss

[07:10] <hmpedersen> soundray and eck, thanks
[07:10] <pipeline_> http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/5746/parallelspictureim3.jpg <-- any ideas?

[07:13] <erUSUL> henz: i asume that you are in a livecd now? you can not boot your system, right?
[07:13] <radar1976> Enselic_ you can't use bittorrent for an inplace upgrade
[07:13] <magnetron> hej sofia
[07:13] <bluefox83> silver6, a major ubuntu release just came out, millions of people are updating right now :X
[07:13] <henz> erUSUL: im not on a cd i got 6.10 installed
[07:14] <rogue780|laptop> can someone tell me how to change the default keyring password? I accidentally put it in with capslock on...and it's annoying me
[07:14] <soundray> tristanmike: loose cable?
[07:14] <alex_dinamo> has someone have any trouble with sound since Feisty update? I'm having... alsa seems all disconfigured
[07:14] <Enselic_> radar1976: oh, you mean that kind of update....
[07:14] <Lunar_Lamp> radar1976, couldn't you download the alternative cd via bittorrent and upgrade fromt hat? iirc the alt. cd allows upgrade.
[07:14] <yopi> Hi I have a etch distro, is it the right chan?
[07:14] <tristanmike> soundray: other "burned" dvd's work
[07:14] <erUSUL> henz: and why are you trinuing to mount /dev/sda1 it is already mounted in /
[07:14] <erUSUL> ?
[07:14] <mlalkaka> Hi everyone
[07:14] <eck> rogue780|laptop: try gnome-keyring-manager
[07:14] <tristanmike> soundray: like data dvd's and such
[07:14] <Pici> yopi: Nope, you'd want a debian channel.
[07:15] <tristanmike> soundray: lemme try a "backup" dvd....
[07:15] <radar1976> Lunar_Lamp I could but only one system to upgrade, so why waste a CD
[07:15] <mwbohn> After I upgraded from 6.10 to 7.04, my the CD drive on my System76 laptop stopped working.  There is no /dev/scd0, /dev/cdrom, or /dev/hd*  Anyone have experience with this?
[07:15] <radar1976> something that I don't have alot of
[07:15] <ctothej> what are the Super_[X]  keycodes?
[07:15] <magnetron> hi mlalkaka
[07:15] <Lunar_Lamp> radar1976, use a cd-rw :-p
[07:15] <radar1976> don't have any of those
[07:15] <soundray> radar1976: sounds like you just have to be patient then
[07:15] <lnxmomo> hi everyone, i would like to know if i can disable the wireless driver that came with ubuntu and use ndiswrapper?
[07:15] <eck> ctothej: usually super is the same as the "windows" key
[07:15] <radar1976> it is running faster today tho
[07:15] <henz> erUSUL: i see the disk in nautilus as WD passport but when i clicik it it doesnt open
[07:16] <rogue780|laptop> eck, that lets me change the keys in the keyring...but I can't figure out how to change the actual keyring password
[07:16] <Agony> OK, I have a problem.
[07:16] <soundray> lnxmomo: yes, you can blacklist the default driver. Ubotu will send you a private message
[07:16] <radar1976> much faster
[07:16] <magnetron> lnxmomo: generally, ndiswrapper has less functionality
[07:16] <soundray> !blacklist > lnxmomo
[07:16] <Agony> I just upgraded to 7.04
[07:16] <kahrytan> Someone should develop Windows driver wrapper FOR ANY driver.
[07:16] <Agony> But now it refuses to boot.
[07:16] <ctothej> eck: xev reports the Super_R is pressed on one of my keyboard buttons, is there a Super_L, etc too?
[07:16] <Pici> !enter | Agony
[07:16] <ubotu> Agony: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[07:16] <eck> rogue780|laptop: i would delete the keyring entry from gconf then and just recreate it
[07:16] <henz> erUSUL: as before mount: /dev/sda1: can't read superblock
[07:16] <henz> error: could not execute pmount
[07:16] <radar1976> I was getting barely 20-30k yesterday... now getting 300k
[07:16] <eck> ctothej: it depends on your keyboard layout
[07:16] <soundray> kahrytan: no, manufacturers should open their specs so proper drivers can be written.
[07:16] <erUSUL> henz: do 'nautilus /'
[07:17] <lnxmomo> ah, thanx soundray and magnetron
[07:17] <tristanmike> soundray: ok, my "backup" dvd works, but factory DVD's don't read as inserted and, as according to the Support docs under "System", I made gxine the default DVD player and that pops up with the "backup" movie dvd, but nothing happens when I insert a factory DVD
[07:17] <Pici> Agony: Do you get an error? 'doesnt boot' is kinda vauge.
[07:17] <mlalkaka> I'm in the process of upgrading from edgy to feisty, and a Debconf screen titled "Configuring mdadm" has appeared. It's asking me to specify "MD arrays needed for the root filesystem". But I don't have any raid (MD arrays) devices on my computer. What do I enter in the text box? all or none?
[07:17] <Rage__> Hi, was just wondering if there is a way to install ubuntu with only xserver all setup and maybe gnome but not all the programs that I dont need so I can install only things I want... Is the best way to do that to in stall server edition and install xserver? TBH I dont even want gnome I use evilwm. :)
[07:17] <magnetron> kahrytan: SOMEONE should develop Linux drivers for ALL devices =)
[07:17] <eck> ctothej: in gnome you can also configure what is recognized as super with system > preferences > keyboard
[07:17] <henz> erUSUL: and?
[07:17] <kahrytan> soundray: or manufacturers just do it themselves.
[07:17] <ctothej> eck: oh, like left and right win/super keys. I got that now. Oh ok, ill check that out too.
[07:17] <DrNick1> Rage__: yep, boot from the alternate CD and install a commandline system, which is an option in the menu
[07:18] <Agony> OK, sorry. I upgraded to 7.04, but now it refuses to boot, the progress bar doesn't move at all.
=== x-spec-t is now known as Spec
[07:18] <soundray> kahrytan: no, that results in bad drivers. See fglrx and nvidia
[07:18] <kahrytan> Nvidia drivers work just fine.
[07:18] <erUSUL> henz: post the output of 'cat /proc/mounts' in a pastebin
[07:18] <Pici> Agony: If you press ctrl-alt-F1 ,  are you getting any error messages?
[07:18] <soundray> kahrytan: yeah, if you happen to have a recent card.
[07:18] <kahrytan> I got FX 5200
[07:18] <Rage__> DrNick1: What package is needed for an x-server install all working? x-windows-system was debian...?
[07:18] <aa^way> hey
[07:18] <aa^way> some deobfuscater for java in ubuntu?
[07:18] <DrNick1> Rage__: then, just install whatever you want.  I used this method to make a working system on a P166Mhz with 64Mb memory!  (but not with GNOME obviously!)
[07:18] <kahrytan> not exactly recent.
[07:19] <tristanmike> soundray, another odd thing of note is that when I shut down the computer last night I left my DVD in the drive, when I rebooted this morning, the icon on the desktop listed the media "Blank DVD" even though it was the factory movie
[07:19] <rambo3> Rage__, use meta packages
[07:19] <Agony> I'll go check, hang on a second. This'll be annoying, I only have the one machine.
[07:19] <DrNick1> err, i can't remember now, xorg-base i believe
[07:19] <Pici> Agony: before you go
[07:19] <kahrytan> I'm waiting on CX23418 support.
[07:19] <Agony> Yes?
[07:19] <Huffalump2> kahrytan, your FX 5200 works with nvidia-glx-new and you can do Beryl, et al?
[07:20] <soundray> tristanmike: this is a really weird problem. Have you got a second DVD drive for testing?
[07:20] <Pici> Agony: If you remove the quiet nosplash options from your grub menu (edit by pressing 'e'), if the ctrl-alt-f1 method doesnt reveal anything.

[07:20] <Rage__> rambo3: which package am I looking for?
[07:20] <Penggu> hi all. is it possible to run ubuntu as a livecd, whilst using some local partitions for user data stoage and swap ?
[07:20] <Rage__> rambo3: for xserver only?
[07:20] <Valstorm2379> Im using Fdutils, can someone tell the command to FORMAT the floppy in terminal???
[07:20] <tristanmike> soundray: .....perhaps I can get one...should I just "plug and play" ?
[07:20] <eck> Penggu: yeah, just use mount and swapon
[07:20] <kahrytan> hufflalump2: It works with Beryl and Nividia drivers.
[07:20] <kahrytan> Nvidia
[07:20] <LjL> Penggu: i think swap is used automatically, if a suitable partition is found. for storage - just mount
[07:20] <rambo3> Rage__, ah ok install xserver-xorg
[07:20] <Huffalump2> kahrytan - I cannot get anything to work on FX 5600 (aside from boring nv)
[07:20] <Kragnerac> :(
[07:20] <Fishy>  Doesn't the lastest ati driver 8.36.5 work with xorg 7.2 (feisty)?

[07:21] <Kragnerac> I should've got an nVidia card. Nothing seems to work with ATi. :(

[07:21] <mwbohn> Is beryl+xgl (fglrx) broken for 7.04 or do I have a configuration problem?  (It worked for me in 6.10)
[07:21] <Penggu> eck: eg if i install vmware
[07:21] <henz> erUSUL: ive read like 2 post almost identical on the internet, but with none solving, but the wierd thing is that it worked before i reinstalled
[07:21] <kahrytan> huffalump2: aren't I lucky. I got a cheap msi fx 5200 from newegg.
[07:21] <raw-meat1> thank you for that great release!
[07:21] <Rage__> rambo3: Thanks :)
[07:21] <DrNick1> bluefox83: yep i've noticed that.  i turn it off for movies :)
[07:21] <ogami1972> cause it was eating all my memory, so i killed it
[07:21] <LjL> Penggu: for saving settings, mount to /home. that will be only the user-specific settings, though
[07:21] <eck> Penggu: are you trying to do persistent live cd?

[07:21] <Penggu> eck: i guess so
[07:21] <Fishy> bluefox83: I am going to burn my card and by a nvidia soon
[07:22] <bluefox83> DrNick1, so do i:(
[07:22] <finalbeta> bluefox83: that's because the drivers can't handle it, and because xorg is not optimised for it yet. Beryl is still a toy.
[07:22] <LjL> X_Force: ?
[07:22] <X_Force> hmm not a good idea ..
[07:22] <tristanmike> soundray: ....wait a sec....something is weird....
[07:22] <eifzon> anyone that had problem to install drivers for nvidia, geforce 7900GT? on 7.04 fiesty?
[07:22] <X_Force> sry one space to much ..
[07:22] <ikonia> eifzon: no
[07:22] <Huffalump2> kahrytan, I'd say it does sound like you are lucky.  I'm very adverse to upgrading any other machines to Feisty until this error is worked out.
[07:22] <ubuntu> so on my boot partition what should I have?

[07:23] <eck> Penggu: if you are trying to do persistent live cd there are some docs in the wiki, if you just want to use configuration settings on another partition you can mount it and chroot or point you app and the mount point to find the conf files
[07:23] <Huffalump2> eifzon, I have a different card but have seen many people with similar problems today.
[07:23] <Lord_Maynoth_42> is there a link to its version number?
[07:23] <eifzon> ok Huffalump2, what to do?
[07:23] <X_Force> thx LjL

[07:23] <PriceChild> Kragnerac, hey having problems with that card?
[07:23] <Adyeths> How do I recover from a failed attempt at upgrading to Feisty that stopped while in the middle of downloading files?
[07:23] <Huffalump2> eifzon, for me the solution was to change xorg.conf to be "nv" instead of "nvidia" thus using the old driers
[07:23] <Penggu> eck: excellent, thanks. i didn't know what to look for. now i see there's a lot in google
[07:23] <Huffalump2> drivers
[07:23] <eifzon> ok
[07:23] <kahrytan> huffalump2: Nvidia is very linux friendly so I'm sure it will. It's to bad livecd doesn't load the drivers at boot.
[07:24] <eifzon> ill try switch to nv
[07:24] <erUSUL> henz: ok, i have missunderstood you i thoughtr that /dev/sda was your main hard disk... so /dev/sda1 is a ext3 partition from another linux install? try this 'sudo fsck.ext3 -b 32768 -pcv /dev/sda1' to check the partition
[07:24] <Fishy> mwbohn: No. Since beryl doesn not come with beryl_xgl I can't see how it should be solved.
[07:24] <henz> erUSUL: can you come up with anythign or am i totally screwd?
[07:24] <tushar> lol
[07:24] <mwbohn> Fishy: Thanks for the info
[07:24] <Fishy> mwbohn: It may work with the open source drivers, but the performance sucks. At least for me.
[07:25] <Kragnerac> PriceChild: Yes. Everytime I try to start up any Linux distro with my x1300, it prints thousands of lines of error messages in the tty1 console when i boot up.
[07:25] <eifzon> Huffalump2, shall i reboot after this?
[07:25] <Huffalump2> eifzon, I did and all was "well" (boring but working)
[07:25] <PriceChild> Kragnerac, ah i thought you said nvidia 8800

[07:37] <niriven> So i noticed there is a 'gusty' dist on the ubuntu ftp site, anyone run it yet? I know its not really, well, stable, though, just curious about anyones thoughts on it.

[07:37] <Adyeths> I have no idea if its bootable. I haven't tried to reboot.

[07:38] <Adyeths> as far as I know all that happened was it was downloading stuff.
[07:38] <soundray> Adyeths: and then?
[07:38] <Rage__> Bo7a: Ok, not prob for me then :) sorry for you though.
[07:38] <kahrytan> kneeki: you needed a laugh.
[07:38] <Adyeths> it stopped in the middle of the process, it says I have a ton of updates to install.

[07:38] <soundray> Adyeths: what's "it"? update-manager?
[07:38] <erUSUL> henz: today is a busy day here with the feisty release... i'm waiting a few days for things to settle down and then i will upgrade too... XD
[07:38] <kahrytan> kneeki: I tolerate it for games and tv recording.
[07:39] <PriceChild> niriven, it won't let you update further. The toolchain is not ready. DON'T upgrade
[07:39] <fluid> any of you ever tweak a synaptics touchpad at all? seems like i have to press awfully hard after enabling shmconfig...always had this problem :(
[07:39] <boguh> hi,how to start the wizard to install codecs for mp3 etc?
[07:39] <soundray> Draconicus: file a bug and mark it as wishlist
[07:39] <soundray> !bugs > Draconicus
[07:39] <jrib> boguh: are you using feisty?
[07:39] <kneeki> kahrytan: That's all I'm using it for also. I really wish linux was better for gaming
[07:39] <eck> danshtr: is this with network manager? i would try stopping it and restarting it
[07:39] <Adyeths> "it" is the cdromupgrade program on the alternate install cd. thats what stopped.
[07:39] <niriven> pricechild: :)
[07:39] <boguh> jrib yes
[07:39] <jrib> boguh: just double click on an mp3
[07:39] <kahrytan> kneeki: Or Vmware was improved for gaming.
[07:39] <Adyeths> and it will not restart because of whatever changes were made when it first started the upgrade process.
[07:39] <Draconicus> soundray: I know, I know. I'm surprised that you don't remember me by now. I'm always in here. :P
[07:39] <boguh> jrib thx
[07:40] <fuffalo-> (evolution question) everytime i mark something as junk it goes to the junk folder, but when i re-open evolution it's back in my inbox..what am i doing wrong? any ideas?  (i'm connecting to an exchange server)
[07:40] <soundray> Draconicus: if you knew, then why did you ask?
[07:40] <kneeki> kahrytan: *nod*
[07:40] <Bo7a> does anyone happen to know the best workaround for older ati cards under feisty? rather than downgrade back to edgy i was wondering if it is at all possible to just downgrade X to 7.1 to make the 8.28 drivers which still have support for my card a possibility. apologies for repeat posting, im not doing it to garner attention just to restate for when someone has time.
[07:40] <ikonia> Bo7a:you don't have to downgrade older cards should be supported too
[07:40] <Bo7a> nope
[07:41] <Bo7a> ati pulled support for 9250 and older cards in 8.35 drivers
[07:41] <kahrytan> kneeki: VMWare needs better resource management and 3d acceleration.
[07:41] <henz> erUSUL: hehe i hear you, but ill prolly wait a long time, havent even considering changing untill i learn some more :P
[07:41] <Bo7a> so no 3-d for me unlessi go back to .28
[07:41] <magnetron> boguh : dblclick a mp3 or install package ubuntu-restricted-extras
[07:41] <Artemis3> Bo7a, forget 3d use vesa mode :P
[07:41] <eck> fuffalo-: i _think_ it depends what mailbox system you are using, e.g. if you are using imap it may be trying to move it into a junk folder on the imap account
[07:41] <ikonia> Bo7a: is there no legacy package like for nvidia in fesity ?
[07:41] <soundray> Adyeths: I would try booting the system. If it boots even to recovery mode, you can finish the upgrade with 'dpkg --configure -a'
[07:41] <POVaddct> ati really sucks
[07:41] <lasse> Hi. Is there a way to find your horizsync and vertrefresh other than the back of your monitor or the HW manual?
[07:41] <ikonia> lasse: ddcprobe may detect it ok
[07:41] <Artemis3> if it only they would release the specs of the ati cards... why is amd hesitating?
[07:41] <Bo7a> its an ati card not nvidia ikonia. the issue here is 8.28 drivers dont work wtioh xorg 7.2 and 8.35 drivers dont work with the older c ards
=== Scombr0 is now known as Scombr0`
[07:42] <lasse> ikonia, thanks man
[07:42] <Scombr0`> hi all
[07:42] <soundray> POVaddct: it does, but don't tell them that. Be polite and tell them that you are disenchanted with their level of support for Linux.
[07:42] <Phantomse> Could somebody at least tel me if the driver works on feisty?
[07:42] <Bo7a> im wondering if downgrading to xorg 7.1 will help or should i just go back to edgy
[07:42] <LjL> lasse: no, although some monitors can send that information automatically. but then, if they do, your very dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg will use that information when instructed to "auto-detect" the monitor
[07:42] <Scombr0`> i wanted to know how do I get my chipset information?
[07:42] <ikonia> Bo7a: I know its ati not nvidia, hence why I said is there not a legacy package LIKE the nvidia legacy package in fesity
[07:42] <kahrytan> kneeki: what  games you play?
[07:42] <mrec> POVaddct: ATI support will improve in future
[07:42] <maccam94> Scombr0`, lspci
[07:42] <LjL> !downgrade | Bo7a
[07:42] <ubotu> Bo7a: Attempting to downgrade to an older Ubuntu version is explicitly not supported, and may break your system.
[07:42] <fluid> im hoping so since they are AMD now...
[07:42] <Scombr0`> thank you maccam94
[07:42] <soundray> mrec: have you got a source reference for that information?
[07:42] <maccam94> np
[07:42] <marcom> greetings from da berlin release-party of feisty !
[07:42] <POVaddct> mrec: i hope so
[07:43] <magnetron> greetings marcom
[07:43] <Artemis3> well sure the newer multicore amd/ati cpus will have documented instructions, but the older radeon?
[07:43] <Bo7a> hehe LjL, thanks but i had i mind just installing edgy from scratch. id prefer not to do this. anyone know o f a reason not to go back to xorg 7.1 in feisty to give me the abvility to use the drivers that were around before ati forsook me
[07:43] <mrec> soundray: I work at AMD, naturally linux is growing and it's seen at ATI/AMD
[07:43] <fluid> but im up and running 7.04, ati fglrx, beryl, and xgl...only 1 tiny issue i have and all it does is lower framerate in xgl a tiny bit.
[07:43] <soundray> mrec: I was hoping that the acquisition would improve things, but no sign of it yet.
[07:44] <LjL> Bo7a: well, *how* do you intend to go back? a reason is, broken dependencies
[07:44] <ikonia> Bo7a: I suspect many things are linked against the current xorg in fesity
[07:44] <mrec> soundray: things take time
[07:44] <Artemis3> mrec, the problem is with the legacy hardware, if its not worth to maintain it, why not just document it so the community can maintain it?
[07:44] <matkix0s> How do you enable dual head? I have an nvidia 6200 and installed the restricted driver. I just upgraded and wish to re-ebable my "Twinview" Or dual head.
[07:44] <matkix0s> !dualhead
[07:44] <ubotu> Information about dual-head on linux can be found on http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/DualHead - See also !Xinerama
[07:44] <Bo7a> yeah thats what i thought, thanks ikonia, guess its back to edgy until ati decided to do something aboutt his
[07:44] <POVaddct> soundray: that's exactly what i thought. but ati now owned by amd seemingly changed nothing.
[07:44] <deathplanter> my wireless settings are wrong and i'd like to change them. is there a fancy file that i should edit? i'm using server edition
[07:44] <boguh> how can i change a label of an ext3 partiton?
[07:44] <ikonia> deathplanter: a wirless card on a server ?
[07:44] <lasse> LjL, ok because ive got a laptop with ATI on it, and I cant get neither fglrx to work (just freezes, no error in dmesg /var/log/messages or /var/log/Xorg.0.log), and the "ati" driver gives me no more than a resolution of 1024x768. This worked on edgy. Can't seem to find the problem
[07:44] <fluid> seemingly changed nothing yet. they havent owned ati for that long...
[07:45] <fluid> and fixing what exists might be more of a pain than just starting from scratch.
[07:45] <mrec> Artemis3: I cannot say more about that since I don't have accurate information about it either (and I'm not allowed to write everything actually) but things will improve luckily
[07:45] <soundray> matkix0s: there are instructions in the readme under /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx
[07:45] <deathplanter> ikonia: i know it sounds weird. anyways, what file to edit?
[07:45] <LjL> boguh: man e2label
[07:45] <bakerconspiracy> yay!, new operating system!
[07:45] <Bo7a> lasse, which card? new ati drivers in feisty do not support the older radeons
[07:45] <fluid> ATI has always had poopy software no matter what platform you use it on
[07:45] <mrec> if someone has bugreports he can forward them to me here as well
[07:45] <ikonia> deathplanter: depends what settings are wrong
[07:45] <Bo7a> ie:9250 and older

[07:45] <Artemis3> mrec, i know, but there have been interviews in the inquirer with amd ppl talking about the future
[07:45] <jrib> i-nZ: install the nautilus-open-terminal package
[07:45] <POVaddct> Bo7a: wait, isn't the 9250 supported by the open source radeon driver too?
[07:45] <mrec> soundray: sure

[07:46] <Alan> does anybody here have vmware workstation successfully installed under Feisty?  For some reason it doesn't like the linux headers... "The directory of kernel headers (version @@VMWARE@@ UTS_RELEASE) does not match your running kernel (version 2.6.20-15-generic)."
[07:46] <POVaddct> Bo7a: the 'radeon' driver

[07:47] <sogen> erUSUL: you have any idea how i can run AA ?
[07:48] <bakerconspiracy> shit
[07:48] <henz> erUSUL: 120 gig too
[07:48] <bakerconspiracy> is 7.04 going to kill my system?
[07:48] <ProN00b> ZOMG WHY IS FEISTY SO PWNAGE ?!?!
[07:48] <jrib> babo: kill it and see if you can recreate it
[07:48] <mrec> Artemis3: well all I can say is everything's heard about that at ATI, (I'm in the AMD division here actually, but I use to pass some information forward to them)

[07:48] <Caramba_> hiya folks. How should I go about to automount my external usb-drive under ubuntu...*running in console mode*
[07:48] <Bo7a> well considering the newest cedega engine finally made me able to completely delet my windows partitions 24 hours b4 feisty was introduced, this angers me a bit. at ATI not ubuntu of course
[07:48] <tristanmike> monacaxxx: you should just need to install the "flashplugin-nonfree" package
[07:48] <henz> erUSUL:  but i havent filled it with anything more then updates and some themes for beryl :P
[07:48] <soundray> mrec: I'm not getting through. Are you not registered?
[07:48] <bakerconspiracy> Cramba
[07:48] <fluid> ProN00b: dont know, but i can tell you that i can finally shut down gnome without it locking up this laptop ... every distro ive tried on it did (even edgy)
[07:48] <deathplanter> ikonia: okay,thanks. will it be automatically set correctly if i set stuff okay there?
[07:48] <Caramba_> baker
[07:48] <Artemis3> mrec, cool, keep going. Maybe i should praise intel 3d hardware too ;)
[07:48] <bakerconspiracy> you need to edit your /ect/fstab file
[07:48] <fbarcenas> I can't use desktop effects. Its says the composite extension is not available. How can I fix this, and what does the darn thing do?
[07:48] <babo> jrib: hmm ... it seems to work fine the second time around ...
[07:48] <ikonia> deathplanter: if you edit that file - yes
[07:48] <mrec> soundray: you have to be registered :-) not I, but I am yes
[07:49] <bakerconspiracy> /etc/fstab
[07:49] <sogen> erUSUL: have any ide how i can run AA on my ubuntu ?

[07:49] <Zamber> LjL I want to leave the message, if there are unneeded packages (i. e. after deleting kubuntu-desktop witch I don't want) it would be grat to have them on the list but I want to leave the ubuntu-desktop dependencies
[07:49] <Bo7a> so most of us are in agreement then? the only fix at the moment for older ati cards is to go back to edgy?
[07:49] <LjL> ProN00b, you've been warned, kicked etc enough times i think... don't force me to make it a ban.
[07:49] <Caramba_> baker...what should I put in it? I want the drive to mount to a specific point in /media when I plug it in
[07:49] <LjL> Zamber: type  sudo apt-get install every-single-one-of-the-listed-packages , that should convince APT that those packages were actually intended to stay installed
[07:50] <monacaxxx> tristanmike, sorry my fault
[07:50] <monacaxxx> it's there
[07:50] <Zamber> LjL ok - trying

[07:55] <RedRose> Does anyone know if there is a program that will show me the management of space within my dir's?
[07:55] <Zamber> LjL thanks :D you're a genius ^^
[07:55] <Bo7a> imhoping someone will post an idea
[07:55] <J-_> Is there any software that you can use a frontend only? So if a server has only a backend (cli) the live CD can be put in the drive, and used with as a gui implimenting change on that server or machine?
[07:55] <ctothej> or script
[07:55] <eck> RedRose: baobab
[07:55] <riesseg_> hello
[07:55] <andy_> where can I find the mount options for the automatically mounted drives in gnome?
[07:55] <ikonia> Bo7a: so whats the question then, if they are not supported, your out of luck
[07:55] <LjL> RedRose: try Baobab, it's installed by default
[07:55] <ra21vi> hi
[07:55] <riesseg_> i need help :(
[07:55] <shwag> eck: yah, thats what I have on my LTS install.  i guess i was just figuring since feisty is brand new... but anyway.
[07:55] <riesseg_> i can't download package from ubuntu's server...
[07:55] <eck> andy_: just run the 'mount' command by itself
[07:55] <yasser> why does ubuntu not have the special HP printer device manager while kubuntu has it??
[07:56] <riesseg_> it's broke?
[07:56] <PriceChild> riesseg_, /topic
[07:56] <atomiku> Im having a little trouble, I want my 4gig partition to be the partition the computer boots from, and another partition with ubuntu on it. how can I do this?
[07:56] <ra21vi> is there any way to install/upgrade to Feisty, using just Disk Images (iso downloaed *image*) from Edgy
[07:56] <Bo7a> ikonia, please keep your snark to yourself. i was asking a question aboute 'where to go from here' not for an explanation of a problem i understand
[07:56] <shingoki> If I install kde on ubuntu, do I get desktop effects?
[07:56] <soundray> J-_: yes. You can connect to the server from the graphical machine with 'ssh -X server' and have all X programs redirected their output to your local screen.
[07:56] <shingoki> I really don't like gnome
[07:56] <LjL> ra21vi: if you use the *Alternate* ISO images, yes
[07:56] <LjL> !alternate > ra21vi    (ra21vi, see the private message from Ubotu)
[07:56] <LjL> !upgrade > ra21vi    (ra21vi, see the private message from Ubotu)
[07:56] <ikonia> Bo7a: I'm not being Snakry (??) if the card isn't supported there is nothing you can do ???
[07:56] <PriceChild> shingoki, yes if you have the  "desktop-effects" package installed
[07:56] <Bo7a> im afriad you are on the wrong network for telling ppl 'there is nothing you can do'
[07:57] <Bo7a> that answer is usally incorrect
[07:57] <riesseg_> whaaoo... feisty dawn is out... nooooooooooooooooooooo !
[07:57] <ha> shingoki: have a look at www.beryl-project.org
[07:57] <yasser> why does ubuntu not have the special HP printer device manager while kubuntu has it??
[07:57] <ircusr> good question
[07:57] <J-_> soundray: cool, pretty interesting.
[07:57] <shwag> LjL: how can I check what version of django is currently in gutsy ?
[07:57] <ikonia> Bo7a: ???? what are you talking about. The card is not supported and not working. If you don't want to wait for ati to fix something - then your only other option is to go back to edgy as you said yourself - so there is nothing you can do
[07:57] <ctothej> fiesty is up and running on my laptop. all is well so far! hope the battery life is good.
[07:57] <haffe> !desktop-effects
[07:57] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about desktop-effects - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[07:57] <ctothej> tablet even
[07:57] <shingoki> PriceChild: ah right I'll give that a go. I'm never sure whether kubuntu is better than ubuntu + kde, I've been running edgy with ubuntu+kde and it seems to have less issues than kubuntu does, which is weird
[07:57] <LjL> shwag: gutsy doesn't exist yet. there's currently no version of anything
[07:57] <riesseg_> grrr ctothej
[07:57] <J-_> soundray: thought I was onto something new  and cool =X lol
[07:58] <ctothej> riesseg_: whats that about?
[07:58] <ircusr> i dont like kde
[07:58] <Bo7a> ok so that make two opinions ikonia, yours, and mine. and as i said. that is hartdly enought. just ignore my posts if you have nothing to add
[07:58] <riesseg_> i want it, i want it, i want it !
[07:58] <LjL> shwag: check http://packages.ubuntu.com/ - but not now, in a couple of weeks.
[07:58] <antioch> How can I configure Synaptic to use Aptitude instead of apt-get in Feisty?
[07:58] <ircusr> xubuntu ftw!
[07:58] <ctothej> riesseg_: hehe.. you cant install it yet?
[07:58] <shingoki> ircusr: Well you're in luck then, since everyone is going for gnome! ;)
[07:58] <riesseg_> nop
[07:58] <ikonia> Bo7a: but your asking questions that are nothing to do with ubuntu - the ati drivers don't support it, question ati about it
[07:58] <LjL> antioch: you can't, since Synaptic doesn't use apt-get at all AFAIK, it is its own APT frontend.
[07:58] <ircusr> yeah!
[07:58] <ircusr> gnome and xfce rule!!
[07:58] <Bo7a> my questions are about ubuntu not the drivers
[07:58] <riesseg_> server is down :'(
[07:58] <ra21vi> LjL: thanks
[07:58] <fluid> what is the easiest way to change icons on things like, the nautilus recycle bin??
[07:58] <atomiku> Im having a little trouble, I want my 4gig partition to be the partition the computer boots from, and another partition with ubuntu on it. how can I do this?
[07:58] <ikonia> Bo7a: so what is the question ?
[07:58] <dv_> I want the gnome interface (maybe with a few more options) and KDE tech
[07:58] <soundray> J-_: X was designed with this kind of network use in mind
[07:59] <shingoki> ircusr: I would like something that look like gnome, but is as technically good as kde
[07:59] <Bo7a> ie: perhaps there is a way with a lot of work to go back to xorg 7.1 :) or something far out that i havent thought of.
[07:59] <ctothej> riesseg_: oh man. good luck with that.
[07:59] <antioch> LjL, so does it keep track of dependencies and such "smartly" like Aptitude does?
[07:59] <shingoki> dv_: yeah exactly!
[07:59] <rambo3> Bo7a, just use "ati" driver its works
[07:59] <riesseg_> han! i must test thu unofficial server... perhaps...
[07:59] <ircusr> shingoki: have you tried xfce?
[07:59] <dv_> for graphics, throw in E17 tech
[07:59] <LjL> antioch: yes and no. Ubuntu's APT *includes* that "smarty" feature (not apt-get, the APT backend itself does). it works a little differently from aptitude's one, but the concept is the very same
[07:59] <bgray54> hello
[07:59] <shingoki> a gnome/kde merger would be great, the kde guys could teach the gnome guys how to code, and the gnome guys could make the kde app layouts a bit less weird
[07:59] <ircusr> hi
[07:59] <ircusr> xfce
[07:59] <ircusr> or fluxbox
[07:59] <Bo7a> your definition of works is not the same as mine :p i am posting from feisty with ati as driver. but this is not optimal. so rather than just give up and go back to edgy i figured id watch the chatter in here for a couple of hours and maybe someone has another idea
[08:00] <dv_> yeah
[08:00] <eck> shingoki: not likely
[08:00] <fluid> nah they dont need to merge. hehe...
[08:00] <Sputnik> ata2.01: failed to set xfermode (err_mask=0x4) How do I fix this error?
[08:00] <antioch> LjL, am I safe using aptitude and synaptic together?
[08:00] <LjL> antioch: i don't know if Synaptic explicitly supports removing of unused dependencies, but you can always  sudo apt-get autoremove  to wipe the cruft at any time, even if it was installed using Synaptic
[08:00] <riesseg_> someone know a french room for ubuntu?
[08:00] <shingoki> ircusr: it's not really window managers I'm bothered about, more the apps. KDE has good apps, and gnome has a good overall look and feel, but generally substandard apps
[08:00] <ikonia> Bo7a: you said yourself the card is not supported by ati - ubuntu can't change this, so your option is to use the "broke" ati driver or bo back to a working senario in edgy
[08:00] <StoneNote> !fr
[08:00] <ubotu> Allez a #ubuntu-fr ou #kubuntu-fr pour de l'aide et de la discussion en francais.
[08:00] <hans0lo> I just ran a bunch of updates, and it's complaining about software no longer supported, which is now community supported. What repos do I need to add?
[08:00] <riesseg_> !fr
[08:00] <ircusr> ah
[08:00] <J-_> soundray: cool, never knew that. I thought that I needed to have both systems GUI to actually SSH into one and have a GUI working on the server as well.
[08:00] <ircusr> brb
[08:00] <Agony> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16607/ <- That's the errors I get when I attempt to boot 7.04
[08:00] <ircusr> lunch
[08:00] <LjL> antioch: the unused dependencies databases *should* be synced between APT and aptitude, but i wouldn't bet on it.
[08:00] <ikonia> Bo7a: its not an ubuntu isse, its the driver issue if its not up to your requirments
[08:00] <PriceChild> antioch, aptitude maintains its own list. so if you use both aptitude and synaptic then aptitude won't undo dependencies as well
[08:00] <surviver> anyone familiar with wine?
[08:01] <matkix0s_> !beryl
[08:01] <LjL> !anyone | surviver
[08:01] <dv_> shingoki, a good example is the comparison kioslaves vs. gnomevfs
[08:01] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[08:01] <ubotu> surviver: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:01] <antioch> LjL, do apt-get and synaptic share the list?
[08:01] <Bo7a> ok, ikonia, plz stop replying. yes i understand that for you and i the only visible solution is to go back to edgy. but who is to say that someonei n here wont have a nother idea before i finally give in and go back
[08:01] <shingoki> dv_: or the kde components (kparts I think?) that make konqueror so very very nice to use :)
[08:01] <ep2011> is 10gb on / and 40 on /home a smart combo?
[08:01] <eck> dv_: how are kioslaves better?
[08:01] <antioch> PriceChild, , do apt-get and synaptic share the list?
[08:01] <LjL> antioch: yes, the list is mantained centrally by the APT backend itself.
[08:01] <ikonia> Bo7a: what do you expect though, you don't have a working driver ???? what do you expect people to do  ???
[08:01] <shingoki> dv_: also just stuff like kpdf being so very much better than the various gnome pdf viewers
[08:01] <LjL> antioch: the aptitude list is separate however
[08:02] <PriceChild> ikonia, best you leave it alone please :)
[08:02] <surviver> this is my real question nabs :p
[08:02] <Bo7a> suggest a method of making xorg 7.1 work with feisty? or something else that you or i havent htought of
[08:02] <antioch> LjL, I see. Thank you.
[08:02] <dv_> eck, their modularity is much better designed
[08:02] <alex_dinamo> hello
[08:02] <janpo> Sputnik: have you tried with "ide=nodma" at boot ?
[08:02] <eck> dv_: isn't it true that you cannot access a kioslave like a mountpoint, like fuse?
[08:02] <Bo7a> there is no harm in asking every 10-15 minutes. maybe someone has thougth of something we havent
[08:02] <atomiku> Im having a little trouble, I want my 4gig partition to be the partition the computer boots from, and another partition with ubuntu on it. how can I do this?
[08:02] <surviver> i need some information about wine
[08:02] <Agony> Can anyone shed any light on this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16607/
[08:02] <LjL> antioch: anyway, very likely Feisty's Synaptic includes an "autoremove" feature, so no need to call apt-get just for that -- check, i don't have Synaptic installed
[08:02] <soundray> J-_: well, you need some client X libraries on the server, but not the actual X server and graphics drivers.
[08:02] <dv_> eck, thats the interface part
[08:02] <boubbin> !proftpd
[08:02] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about proftpd - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:03] <PingunZ> What package do I need for xconfig ( I want to recompile my kernel )
[08:03] <ikonia> PriceChild: understood.
[08:03] <atomiku> You see
[08:03] <LjL> !info proftpd > boubbin
[08:03] <atomiku> I think im doing this wrong
[08:03] <PingunZ> !xconfig > PingunZ
[08:03] <ra21vi> LjL: actually i want to know if upgrade is possible thru downloaed Alternate images, i cannt burn it cuz my cdwriter not functioning, old hardware peoblem bro
[08:03] <dv_> in fact, there are kio fuse gateways already
[08:03] <erUSUL> PingunZ: qt3-dev or something like that
[08:03] <PingunZ> erUSUL: ty
[08:03] <Sputnik> janpo, what does it do?
[08:03] <eck> dv_: the issue is that both kde and gnome should just be using fuse, not implementing some compatibility layer
[08:03] <dv_> and its very likely that the kioslaves of kde4 will based on fused
[08:03] <dv_> -d
[08:04] <shingoki> anyway thanks for the advice on desktop effects, I'll give it a go. Also beryl, although TBH every GL accelerated window manager thingy I've ever tried has just spectacularly trashed itself within a few seconds
[08:04] <dv_> eck, fuse didnt exist when they started
[08:04] <LjL> ra21vi: uhm... it's possibly possible =) loop-mount the Alternate ISO... but then why not just upgrade over the internet, since that's what you'd be doing, basically, anyway?
[08:04] <ra21vi> LjL: will it work if i mount the image, and then tell synaptics to add cdriom
[08:04] <alex_dinamo> has anyone had any trouble with sound/alsa since upgrading to Feisty?
[08:04] <styvy> Agony, did you check your cd with md5?
[08:04] <slicknick> anyone seen this sort of behavior from rdesktop before? this is a dual monitor screenshot with an rdesktop session to a windows machine on the right side of the image. http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ushbav
[08:04] <ra21vi> LjL: yeah right..
[08:04] <ikonia> alex_dinamo: a few people with intel chipsets have reported problems
[08:04] <alex_dinamo> it doesn't work at all... n drivers are loaded, alsaconf doesn't detect any card...
[08:04] <LjL> ra21vi: it might, you'd have to try and perhaps fiddle a bit with loopback mounting and sources.list -- but why in the world would you do that?
[08:04] <uber-n00b> hi all :D
[08:04] <janpo> Sputnik: switches off kernels dma on ide channels. Your error could be unsupported drive controller. Just a qualified guess
[08:05] <alex_dinamo> ikonia, I think I have that one... NVidia integrated AC97 audio
[08:05] <Taim> Anybody know how to disable "tooltips" in gnome?
[08:05] <cliebow_> im told cd burned faster than 8x may have corruption of very highlt cmressed files..
[08:05] <Blubloblu> Hi there, I need help with an Edgy to Feisty upgrade that went wrong
[08:05] <deserteagle> hello all, anyone have a clue as to why after installing feisty my monitor looks like it has 8 bit colors?
[08:05] <ikonia> alex_dinamo: no thats nvidia not intel
[08:05] <LjL> ra21vi: i mean, instead of telling APT to just download the packages, you're downloading the ISO, then mounting, then telling APT to download the packages from inside it. doesn't make a bit of sense to me TBH
[08:05] <dv_> eck, but yes, the way I see it fuse will be the common future
[08:05] <compengi> LjL: hi
[08:05] <dv_> I already favor fusemb over the kernel smbfs
[08:05] <LjL> compengi, hi
[08:05] <alex_dinamo> ikonia, mmh... ok
[08:05] <deserteagle> nvidia graphics card
[08:05] <ikonia> dere
[08:05] <ikonia> se
[08:05] <Pici> cliebow_: Yes, if you have issues we suggest that you burn the cd/dvd at the slowest speed.
[08:05] <ikonia> oops
[08:05] <alex_dinamo> ikonia, I think the driver said something about intel though
[08:05] <shingoki> cliebow_: I wouldn't have thought that the compression of the files would affect likelihood of errors, it's probably just that they have checksums so you noticed
[08:05] <compengi> LjL: have you made a good source.list?
[08:05] <ikonia> deserteagle: you'll need the nvidia propritary drivers from the repo
[08:05] <PingunZ> got it erUSUL, ty
[08:05] <ra21vi> LjL: actually I downladed the images for local distribution, but found the Writer not working , lol,... bad luck
[08:06] <POVaddct> dv_: sshfs is also very nice
[08:06] <Agony> styvy: What do you mean check my cd with md5?
[08:06] <deserteagle> ikonia: i let ubuntu install them when i told it to enable desktop effects
[08:06] <deserteagle> =\
[08:06] <LjL> compengi: uh?
[08:06] <shingoki> cliebow_: I've definitely had burn errors when writing at high speed, and if you are ever going to notice errors it will be on install discs :)
[08:06] <ikonia> deserteagle: reconfigure Xorg then to make sure its all set right
[08:06] <dv_> I hope feisty + 1 will make more use of fuse
[08:06] <ikonia> deserteagle: also check if its using the drivers
[08:06] <Andeh> Hello
[08:06] <biqut2> I'm having some problems running X apps on a remote computer using ssh & ubuntu 7.04, can anyone help me out?
[08:06] <deserteagle> ikonia: i did, it is
[08:06] <deserteagle> :(
[08:06] <compengi> LjL: i mean do i need to change anything in my source.list so i can good repos?
[08:06] <cudgel> hey folks.  i have a slight issue.  i'm an admin for a small company, and had a developer who took care of their own systems, and was running a few diff revs of ubuntu.  i need to recover his password, and login, and scan the machine for anything i might want to backup.  sadly, the dev had a falling out w/ the owner, and is unavailable to help.  where should i begin?
[08:06] <Andeh> Is it possible to "turn on" compression for my internet?
[08:06] <nite> where do I find fstab
[08:07] <Andeh> Or install something that will?
[08:07] <LjL> ra21vi: i see... "local distribution" you mean on a network of computers? you see, there is things like apt-proxy and approx that might help you there
[08:07] <ikonia> Andeh: you can't compress the internet

=== s1`_ is now known as s1
[08:07] <LjL> compengi: context please... are you upgrading to feisty from edgy? did it through update manager?
[08:07] <janpo> biqut2: what ssh command are you using ?
[08:07] <ikonia> cudgel: I don't think its appropriate to ask in here to help you gain access to a system
[08:07] <alex_dinamo> ikonia, the thing is: I reinstalled everything that had "alsa" in there.. and there doesn't even seem to be a file below /proc/asound!
[08:07] <Andeh> ikonia: Yes i know that. But i know that sometimes you can turn on some options to speed it up. Is there any kind of internet optimiser for linux? The one for windows speeded mine up a lot, faster than ubuntu is now
[08:07] <lcc77> hi all
[08:07] <Phantoms1> Pleas help me instaling a modem driver in Feisty if posible.

[08:08] <andy_> where can I tell gnome that it should open all my torrent files with deluge and not with gnome-btdownload?
[08:08] <the_glu> how to rezie a windows partition, and take more space for linux  (with a live cd, of course) ?
[08:08] <atomiku> hmm
[08:08] <ra21vi> LjL: i mean to distribute to my friends and install in my college (Local distribution).. usually they look at me when new release comes, they dont have internet
[08:08] <tom_> hey
[08:08] <shingoki> Andeh: a thingy that downloads compressed stuff from a proxy?
[08:08] <compengi> LjL: i had just installed feisty from a clean install and looking for a good source.list
[08:08] <Andeh> ikonia: Um....... So how do i speed up my internet a bit?
[08:08] <biqut2> janpo, "ssh root@192.168.15.101" thats the ip of the remote machine
[08:08] <styvy> Agony, the error message you posted might mean your cd has not the right code, you can check it with comparing the md5-sums
[08:08] <ikonia> Andeh: you don't
[08:08] <Blubloblu> I upgraded Edgy to Feisty using update manager and now when I boot, it says something about bad blocks on a partition. I can't load X, forced to use a command line but home directory was on bad partition

[08:08] <Bo7a> has anyone tried to have a run at feisty while keeping xorg 7.1? (in order to be able to use ati 8.28 drivers) 3 or 4 'that's not possible' would be very appreciated so i could force myself to give in and go back to a clean edgy install.
[08:08] <leon_06> Hey guys ! I successfully installed a Logitech Quickcam express in Ubuntu Feisty and I use camorama to take pictures !
[08:08] <Andeh> shingoki: Well its a box, but i have ADSL internet 360 kb/s
[08:08] <tom_> Is there anyway to make the text in fiesty easier to read... my resolution isn't the way I would like it to be ( I do have an NVidia Graphics card)
[08:08] <ikonia> atomiku: do dpkg l and look
[08:08] <janpo> biqut2: Try ssh -X root@romte-host
[08:08] <Agony> styvy: I'm not using a CD. This is attempting to boot an installed version from my HD.

[08:09] <eck> cudgel: the password will be encrypted anyway, although nothing stops you from mounting the disk partitions
[08:09] <Andeh> shingoki: thats about as fast as it usually goes but the internet optimiser for windows made it go to 400 kb/s
[08:09] <shingoki> Andeh: not for linux, stuff like that tends to be windows, but there's no technical reason it couldn't be done quite easily. Actually you could make one yourself if you buy a shell server login with a good bandwidth allowance
[08:09] <atomiku> ikonia: doesnt tell me anything
[08:09] <deserteagle> tom_ install the restricted fonts "windows fonts"
[08:09] <atomiku> apart from that it needs an option

[08:09] <Clement_Guislain> I just downloaded ubuntu desktop i386 7.04 ISO and burnt it, I want to try and use it as a liveCD, but I have a acer aspire 3020, and I heard about a bug on the ATI X-series mobility GPUs (I have X700 mobility), and it is not working at all (blank screen, PC idle). Can anyone help me, or give me a good link? cheers
[08:09] <Caramba_> bah...now I've messed something up. I cannot mount my external hard drive from the prompt (in console mode), "mount /dev/sda1 /media/temp" gives me "Mount: only root can do that". Now, what have a foo'd up?
[08:10] <deserteagle> ikonia: so no clue as to why my desktop looks so crappy? when i was using vesa drivers it looks good, now with the nvidia drivers it looks crappy :(
[08:10] <compengi> LjL: so i can get good repos for new updates and to be able to install useful software
[08:10] <shwag> what vnc should I install ?
[08:10] <biqut2> janpo, brandon@h3avyps3:~$ ssh -X root@192.168.15.101

[08:10] <atomiku> E: Couldn't find package linux-headers-2.6.20-15
[08:10] <Bo7a> Clement_Guislain, use th alternate install iso
[08:10] <ikonia> Caramba_: use sudo
[08:10] <atomiku> how do I add the fiesty repos?
[08:10] <tom_> deserteagle, how do i do that?
[08:10] <Zamu> ikonia yeah i know. but it works fine in 6.06 but there was something wrong with the driver in 6.10 so i'm hesitant to try 7.04 even though i want to.
[08:10] <ikonia> deserteagle: reconfigure the nvidia ones
[08:10] <compengi> gnomefreak: hi
[08:10] <cudgel> eck: ok, here's the thing.  i'm a redhat guy.  i'm totally familiar with the mechanics of booting a system into single-user to recover a password, off a boot disk, whatever.  and i do suppose thats the route i ought to go...
[08:10] <deserteagle> ikonia: o_O?
[08:10] <ikonia> deserteagle: what ?
[08:10] <Caramba_> ikonia: Sure I could, but I have to be able to mount a usb-disk without being root, aye?
[08:10] <Blubloblu> I'm feeling ignored, I'll try ubuntuforums
[08:11] <ikonia> Caramba_: no
[08:11] <cudgel> eck: ...i'm just wondering if there's a more "ubuntu" way to go abou this.
[08:11] <deserteagle> ikonia: you mean reinstall the nvidia drivers?
[08:11] <biqut2> janpo, funny thing is that it works fine the other way around from that machine to this one
[08:11] <ikonia> deserteagle: no - I mean reconfigure them to make sure the settings are right
[08:11] <Caramba_> ikonia: Huh? It's done in -mode
[08:11] <Bo7a> Clement_Guislain, use th alternate install iso
[08:11] <leon_06> Guys ? Logitech quickcam express -> increase resolution in camorama. Possible ???
[08:11] <Phantoms1> Please help instal a evodo modem with drivers in feisty
[08:11] <Bo7a> oops mispaste sorry
[08:11] <atomiku> what repo do i need to add to be able to apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.20-15
[08:11] <Caramba_> -mode-> x-mode
[08:11] <ikonia> Caramba_: you have to set it up in fstab for that
[08:11] <deserteagle> tom_: google "ubuntu windows fonts install"
[08:11] <ikonia> x-mode ??
[08:11] <Andeh> shingoki: Would that shell server login be cheaper than upgrading my internet?
[08:11] <ikonia> Caramba_: use sudo
[08:11] <Caramba_> graphical mode
[08:11] <blackelf> hi
[08:11] <deserteagle> ikonia: how do i do that? :$
[08:11] <tom_> deserteagle, do you use beryl?
[08:11] <eck> cudgel: i don't think so
[08:11] <Clement_Guislain> bo7a oh I have to redownload then! will I have the nice Compiz desktop effectswith this version? I mean what is the difference between the normal and the alternate? and can I run the alternate as a liveCD too?
[08:11] <ikonia> deserteagle: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:11] <deserteagle> tom_: used it yes
[08:12] <Caramba_> ikonia: don't want to use sudo. what kinda changes have to be done in fstab? got a link to read?
[08:12] <Sarge> Hello, i need some help dual booting xp with ubuntu 7.04, how do i flag the / drive bootable in the install?
[08:12] <LjL> !easysource > compengi    (compengi, see the private message from Ubotu) | this is fine, as always
[08:12] <Bo7a> has anyone tried to have a run at feisty while keeping xorg 7.1? (in order to be able to use ati 8.28 drivers) 3 or 4 'that's not possible' would be very appreciated so i could force myself to give in and go back to a clean edgy install.
[08:12] <ikonia> Caramba_: google for it, the user option is rerequired
[08:12] <deserteagle> ikonia: i did that, and it is using the nvidia drivers
[08:12] <tom_> How do I set it up like in 6.06 so when I bring a window to the top it automaticall maximizes and i can also pull a maximized window and it become moveable
[08:12] <PriceChild> Bo7a, not possible
[08:12] <Bo7a> Caramba_, if yuod rather use an actual root login just do sudo passwd once
[08:12] <Huffalump2> Restricted Drivers Manager is supposed to be located under System > Administration, right?  What does it mean if it's not listed there?  I can't find it for the life of me and I've even asked another person to make sure I'm not blind, but they didn't see it either.
[08:12] <Andeh> shingoki: Would that shell server login be cheaper than upgrading my internet?
[08:12] <ikonia> deserteagle: so check its configured proplery - not just using the drivers
[08:12] <deserteagle> Sarge: you shouldn't have to
[08:12] <Bo7a> then u can su up
[08:12] <tom_> deserteagle, How do I set it up like in 6.06 so when I bring a window to the top it automaticall maximizes and i can also pull a maximized window and it become moveable
[08:12] <ForzaPalermo>  hey guys..... i cant upgrade to fiesty fawn because its telling me i need about 300mb more of diskspace... but i wanna know what i can uninstall or take out.... i have 5gbs partitioned to kubuntu.... so i really dont know why i even need space
[08:12] <ikonia> Andeh: this is ubuntu support - not internet R us
[08:12] <hmpedersen> I have some package dependency problem.. Does anyone know where to find xlibs?
[08:12] <LjL> ra21vi: err... i still don't get you. how are you going to distribute it to them if you can't burn it and you can't send it to them via internet? =)
[08:12] <PriceChild> !attitude > Bo7a
[08:12] <POVaddct> Caramba_: put the keyword "user" in the mount options in fstab
[08:12] <janpo> Biqut2: It could be because the X server is running "-nolisten tcp" I just dunno how to enable it in ubuntu
[08:13] <deserteagle> tom_: i don't think beryl would let you configure that
[08:13] <Andeh> ikonia: My ubuntus crappy internet needs support. Cheer up.
[08:13] <Caramba_> bo7a (and everybody else): I have other users on my machine, in console mode. Idon't want to give everybody sudo-access, they *have* to be able to mount from the command line as themsaelves
=== Zamu is now known as samu2
[08:13] <ikonia> Andeh: this is not an ubuntu support problem. Your internet conneciton is slow. We can't help with that
[08:13] <Caramba_> povaddct: thank you, that's what i was looking for!
[08:13] <biqut2> janpo, it is running -nolisten tcp but I can't figure out how to fix that
[08:13] <tom_> deserteagle, do you know what i'm talking about though... the way windows worked in 6.06 standardly?
[08:14] <compengi> LjL: sould i tick this      Tick this box to include source repositories ?
[08:14] <jrib> Caramba_: depending on how you want it to act, either "user" or "users", man mount explains
[08:14] <Bo7a> PriceChild, i apologize if somehow my questions put forth an 'attitude' but i thought that getting multiple opinions was the *nix way. i was not saying ikonia was incorrect. i heartily agree. but would rather get a few more opinions(and now i have yours) before doing a complete clean install of an older dist
[08:14] <Andeh> ikonia: Oh, i think it is. When i was running <Other operating system> it was much faster. Are there any common things that might be slowing it down?
[08:14] <Phantoms1> Where could I get asistance instaling a evodo modem with drivers in feisty?
=== Clement_Guislain is now known as Voxan
[08:14] <LjL> compengi: only if you intend to compile packages yourself. it won't hurt (aside from making update a tad slower) anyway
[08:14] <PriceChild> Bo7a, feisty uses xorg7.2
[08:14] <ForzaPalermo> anyone?
[08:14] <tehquickness> I cannot play mov files
[08:14] <eck> Caramba_: also, look at the sudoers man page, it is possible to enable only certain users/groups to use sudo (or to have sudo use the root password) and more
[08:14] <LjL> Bo7a, please don't suggest setting a root password
[08:14] <riesseg_> yeeeeeeeeees !
[08:14] <ikonia> Andeh: your network drivers may not be great in linux - or may not communitate with your modem/router as well
[08:15] <riesseg_> i can install festy :P
[08:15] <janpo> Biqut2: /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc
[08:15] <Huffalump2> Everyone else has System > Administration > Restricted Drivers?  I'm the only one who doesn't see that?
[08:15] <riesseg_> alleluia ^^
[08:15] <tehquickness> nvm I think I had a bad .mov
[08:15] <ikonia> riesseg_: we get the idea......
[08:15] <ikonia> riesseg_: give it a rest please this is a busy channel
[08:16] <Andeh> ikonia: No, my network drivers dont EXIST for linux, i had a shitty USB Winmodem with the same adsl connection as i have now.
[08:16] <Andeh> So i got myself a ADSL ROUTER (one network port so you need to buy a real router too :P) to make internet work with linux.
[08:16] <Caramba_> jrieck: thank u 2 for the reply
[08:16] <LjL> riesseg_: /join #ubuntu-release-party
[08:16] <ikonia> !language >andeh
[08:16] <Caramba_> eck: thank u 2 for the reply
[08:16] <Andeh> And i know its not that thats slowing it down
[08:16] <Phantoms1>  I nees asistance instaling a evodo modem with drivers in feisty?
[08:16] <biqut2> janpo, I've edited that file so that it says "exec /usr/bin/X11/X -dpi 100"
[08:16] <deserteagle> tom_: no clue, i've only used 6.10 and now 7.04
[08:16] <nicholaslewis> hi! can anyone give me a hand installing feisty fawn on OS X with Parallels? giving me grief..
[08:16] <janpo> biqut2: you might need to restart the X server
[08:17] <kazuka> is someone in suse
[08:17] <kazuka> can someone tell them to unban me?
[08:17] <sonium> if I have installed a package that showed up a special config dialog during installation, how can I readisplay this dialog?
[08:17] <Andeh> ikonia: No, it's actually called Shitty USB Winmodem. Made in Malasia. They probably had a bad translator.
[08:17] <LjL> kazuka: that's a tad offtopic. more than a tad.
[08:17] <ikonia> kazuka: no -
[08:17] <biqut2> janpo, I did a ctrl+alt+backspc and it still wont work, restarting the whole system doesnt work either
[08:17] <ikonia> Andeh: STOP using the bad language
[08:17] <ikonia> !language >andeh (again)
[08:17] <Andeh> ikonia: Yes, i did. I threw the lovely carp out the window.
[08:18] <compengi> !paste
[08:18] <ubotu> pastebin is a service to post large texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the #ubuntu channel topic)
[08:18] <janpo> biqut2: when ssh'ed into the remote system, does "echo $DISPLAY" point back at your client ?
[08:18] <tarelerulz> I am trying to get feature in Konqueror that lets you filter what it shows you  in real time the fold and files
[08:18] <ubu> hello, i have an i810 and i can't have direct rendering why?
[08:18] <ubu> i have commented the vesafb option
[08:18] <eck> ubu: check the xorg log
[08:18] <biqut2> janpo, it points to the system I am on which is 192.168.15.100
[08:19] <Phantoms1> I nees asistance instaling a evodo modem with drivers in feisty?:)
[08:19] <Andeh> ikonia: If you fail to see my original question related to ****** winmodems, it was " How can i speed my internet up even more WITHIN linux. "
[08:19] <compengi> LjL: does this one looks good? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16614/
[08:19] <ikonia> Andeh: you can't
[08:19] <Andeh> ikonia: i already have some tweaks for firefox
[08:19] <compengi> LjL: or the official one is better?
[08:19] <ikonia> Andeh: its probably a driver releated issue
[08:19] <nicholaslewis> Does anyone know why the error "ACPI : Unable to locate RSDP" appears when trying to install Feisty on OS X with parallels????
[08:19] <ra21vi> can i do upgrade with Gnome still running?
[08:19] <ra21vi> in gnome-terminal
[08:19] <ikonia> ra21vi: yes but it won't take effect until you restart
[08:19] <Andeh> ikonia: There ARE no drivers, i said that.
[08:19] <ra21vi> ikonia: ok
[08:19] <ikonia> Andeh: then how is it working ?
[08:20] <Huffalump2> In the Feisty menu, is there supposed to be an item titled Restricted Drivers Manager under System > Administration?  And if so, what does it mean if I don't have that?
[08:20] <LjL> compengi: looks fine, just keep in mind backports might not be too stable (they usually are, though, ime)
[08:20] <ahmed> is Feisty using GNOME 2.18?
[08:20] <ra21vi> ahmed: yup
[08:20] <ikonia> ahmed: yes
[08:20] <ahmed> thanks
[08:20] <Andeh> ikonia: An automatic LAN connection thru my ADSL router that i bought  4 linux
[08:20] <Andeh> i gtg bye
[08:20] <fluid> what does "enable roaming mode" do in the wireless network manager?
[08:20] <ahmed> it just doesn't seem different from Edgy look-wise
[08:20] <snadge> im getting a not enough disk free message trying to upgrade to feisty, however i have 1.2 gig free, is that enough?
[08:20] <biqut2> janpo, root@slax:~# echo $DISPLAY
[08:20] <biqut2> 192.168.15.100:0.0
[08:20] <eck> Huffalump2: were you running the feisty beta? i think you had to dist-upgrade to get it
[08:21] <ikonia> ahmed: its using the ubuntu theme - so will look the same
[08:21] <lavid> a question: it seems myself and some other people are having an issue with USB drives not being mounted with exec privledges in kubuntu feisty, is anyone having that issue in ubuntu feisty as well? i'd like to include that in the bug report too if so
[08:21] <LjL> snadge: might not be enough, if you have very many packages installed...
[08:21] <ahmed> thanks again
[08:21] <compengi> LjL: well do you appreciate the official one or this one if you were me?
[08:21] <LjL> compengi: they're not very different. the official one just doesn't include universe and multiverse
[08:21] <nicholaslewis> Does anyone know why the error "ACPI : Unable to locate RSDP" appears when trying to install Feisty on OS X with parallels????
[08:21] <janpo> biqut2: last thing, does the remote system support X-forwarding ?
[08:22] <ra21vi> should i remove beryl before upgrading, cuz I installed it from some otehr repo
[08:22] <Huffalump2> eck, I may have unintentionally done precisely that because I could not get the upgrade yesterday until i ran some line command with -d (which I think gave me a beta instead of final).   How would I go about updating from a beta to final, then?  I'd like to be on the same page as everyone else.
[08:22] <mrec> nicholaslewis: seems to be a bios problem
[08:22] <LjL> !final > Huffalump2    (Huffalump2, see the private message from Ubotu)
[08:22] <q07sa> <ra21vi> yes
[08:22] <eck> Huffalump2: it should just be: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[08:22] <ra21vi> q07sa: ook
[08:22] <Phantoms1>  I need asistance instaling a evodo modem with drivers in feisty?:)
[08:22] <Gunrun> I am trying to blank the drive ubuntu is on, I'm using Gparted, and can only delete /dev/hda1, there are two other entries, extended, and linux swap, and I can't delete either of them
[08:22] <Gunrun> can anyone help?
[08:22] <nicholaslewis> mrec: any ideas on how to correct it?
[08:22] <Huffalump2> eck, thanks.  0 packages to install
[08:23] <eck> Huffalump2: the default behavior of apt upgrade is to upgrade installed packages, but not to install new packages -- the dist-upgrade will make apt grab the new things (or remove deprectated things) too
[08:23] <biqut2> janpo, ssh_config says "ForwardX11 yes"
[08:23] <Huffalump2> Yet, my menu is incorrect.  How can one launch this Restricted Drivers Manager?
[08:23] <gortiz> someone could help me? I have a fat32 partition, I've done a du -sh to check the usage and it says 15G but with df -h I see a 33G
[08:23] <ubu> eck, here's my config http://www.pastebin.ca/450244
[08:23] <maddash> Gunrun: that's probably because the partition you want to kill off is still mounted
[08:23] <biqut2> janpo, btw the host line is "Host *"
[08:23] <LjL> Huffalump2: uhm, dirty trick -- if you're on nvidia at least, try opening Desktop Effects, it should ask you about that. then you'll have the icon for Restricted. at least it happened that way for me
[08:23] <ra21vi> how to do FQDN?
[08:24] <Gunrun> ok, so how do I rectify this? maybe I am going about it the wrong way. I basically want a blank drive with no file system, or boot manager
[08:24] <janpo> biqut2: What about /etc/ssh/sshd_config ? Does that say X11forwarding = yes too ?
[08:24] <ra21vi> apache compalins about not getting FQDN
[08:24] <soothsay> Can anyone point me to the system requirements for Feisty Server?
[08:24] <Gunrun> (using the live disk btw)
[08:24] <biqut2> janpo, ues thats the file I am looking at
[08:24] <compengi> LjL: is feisty's source different from edgy?
[08:24] <Jet2k5> hello, I'm looking to try Ubuntu, and if I don't like it, how easy is it to go back to windows?  How hard is it to repartition the hdd and get rid of the bootloader ?
[08:24] <linxeh> biqut2: did you do ssh -X ?
[08:24] <LjL> Gunrun: you want to wipe your HD? dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdwhatever, i'd say
[08:24] <Tarkus> what do i need to install to get mp3 support? and what is the best alternative to Windows Media Player? is it Realplayer?
[08:24] <biqut2> linxeh, yes
[08:24] <gortiz> any help?
[08:24] <LjL> compengi: yes, it has the word "feisty" instead of "edgy" in the repos names :)
[08:24] <janpo> biqut2: I'm out, sorry
[08:24] <Huffalump2> LjL, thank you.  I'm sorry to report that I do not see any listing for Desktop Effects either
[08:24] <ahmed> soothsay: 64MB RAM, 500MB diskspace (min)
[08:25] <ubu> biqut2:you need to ssh -Y otherwise you will get safe x11 and all apps won't work
[08:25] <mrec> nicholaslewis: asking parallels if they can check their bios, you might try to boot your box with noacpi nolapic
[08:25] <ra21vi> soothsay: for server, you can install it anywhere
[08:25] <Gunrun> LjL and that will allow the person I am selling the PC to to install whatever he wants on it?
[08:25] <LjL> Tarkus: if you're on Feisty, just click on an an MP3 file. and you have Totem for playing video.
[08:25] <eck> ubu: search for the line that starts with (EE) and then search for that error message on the forums/google
[08:25] <mrec> nop__: s/noacpi/noapic/
[08:25] <Gunrun> and where do I run this? just type what you typed inside terminal?
[08:25] <soothsay> ahmed: Is there a page with that info?
=== fluid_ is now known as fluid
[08:25] <compengi> LjL: oh.. so i can use my old source but just change the word edgy to fiesty?
[08:25] <Jet2k5> does the windows type affect for ubuntu, I think they call it it berely, are those standard or do they require an extensive amount of knowledge of LInux?
[08:25] <ahmed> yes, the release notes
[08:25] <soothsay> ahmed: (Thanks BTW)
[08:25] <biqut2> ubu, -Y and -X?
[08:25] <LjL> Gunrun: i'd say so, if they know how to :)
[08:25] <ahmed> no problem

[08:25] <snadge> is it ok to manually apt-get dist-upgrade from edgy to feisty? (since the update tool complains of a disk space error)
[08:25] <Jet2k5> ty

[08:26] <LjL> compengi: if it only had official repositories, yes. but it'll end up being the same as the one that you just generated
[08:26] <ubu> biqut2, Y is for unsafe and X for save...in unsafe you must trust the server
[08:26] <LjL> Huffalump2: dunno...
[08:26] <kazuka> anyone using vmware with ubuntu here?
[08:26] <Huffalump2> Phantoms1 - you *may* also want to try #ubuntu-ro in case anyone else has Zapp there
[08:26] <vicks> i can't get usb to work in feisty, can someone help me? i have installed kubuntu feisty, and nothing happens when i insert usb-peripherals. i can't even install ubuntu (gnome), cause the installation hangs at the end when trying to load the usb-starage module.
[08:26] <fluid> hmm..wonder if topousa and the gps i have would work in wine. lol...
[08:26] <LjL> !anyone | kazuka
[08:26] <ubotu> kazuka: A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[08:26] <Gunrun> gah sod it I'll just dig out my windows 98 boot disk
[08:26] <kazuka> sorry then
[08:26] <Melvinator> hey I am running dapper and it hangs when doing APT-GET UPDATE
[08:26] <Melvinator> any ideas why?
[08:26] <kazuka> which one is better fiesty fawn or edgy eft?
[08:27] <Huffalump2> LjL - Desktop Effects should supposedly be under System > Administration ?
[08:27] <Melvinator> it resolves the ip for the ubuntu repos
[08:27] <Melvinator> but it hangs
[08:27] <fluid> Melvinator: because they just released a new ubuntu, and its all slow.
[08:27] <VR_> Melvinator, it's too busy probably
[08:27] <Melvinator> hmrm
[08:27] <LjL> Huffalump2: or preferences, don't remember
[08:27] <ahmed> Melvinator: I don't think dapper to feisty upgrades are possible
[08:27] <LjL> Huffalump2: i'm not on gnome usually (including now)
[08:27] <Melvinator> well the other problem is that i have 2 packages that will not install
[08:27] <Melvinator> and im not getting any new updates
[08:27] <deathplanter> guys, my mate has resolution problem and even editing xorg.conf won't help. what's wrong?
[08:27] <Huffalump2> LjL, Ah... thanks
[08:27] <linxeh> ahmed: maybe he was just updating the dapper package list?...
[08:27] <ahmed> oh, sorry
[08:27] <ubu> eck, the only EE is (EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable ...it's strange
[08:27] <Melvinator> ahmed, yeah im not trying to upgrade to feisty
[08:27] <linxeh> you can always upgrade via edgy anyway
[08:27] <Melvinator> just trying to get updates
[08:27] <ahmed> sorry
[08:28] <biqut2> ubu, brandon@h3avyps3:~$ ssh -Y root@192.168.15.101

[08:28] <ubu> biqut2 yes
[08:28] <shea> SO, here's an odd one:   after upgrading edgy to feisty, and rebooting, i just get a grub terminal with no error.
[08:28] <Melvinator> are there any mirrors i can use in my sources.list
[08:28] <ubu> biqut2 that's correct
[08:28] <deathplanter> guys, my mate has resolution problem and even editing xorg.conf won't help. what's wrong?
[08:28] <Melvinator> that might move faster
[08:28] <gortiz> mhmm a problem with dosfsck.. it says "Leaving file system unchanged."
[08:28] <biqut2> ubu, I'm thinking the problem is the -nolisten tp but I can't seen to fix that
[08:28] <shea> i tried to manually load /boot/grub/menu.lst, and it said 'cylinder number too high for bios' or something to that effect.
[08:28] <robert__> Anyone with experience with OpenOffice that can tell me how to change  into " ?
[08:29] <ra21vi> is reiserfs4 incldued?
[08:29] <shea> i'm at work now, and the machine is at home, so I can't get the exact message.
[08:29] <almimoni> how can i install flashplayer for firefox i tried apt-get but didn't work?
[08:29] <linxeh> robert_: search and replace ?
[08:29] <Huffalump2> robert__ search and replace?
[08:29] <eck> deathplanter: when X starts up it logs all the information about what happened when it tried to set the resolution, but log file might help you figure out why it won't take the new res
[08:29] <biqut2> ubu, everytime it still says cannot connect to X server
[08:29] <ubu> biqut2,  -nolisten tp???
[08:29] <compengi> LjL: can you check this one please http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16616/
[08:29] <ForzaPalermo> does anyone know how to clear space in kubuntu? i have 5gs dedicated to it, but yet im out o fspace even though all i have on here is the OS... everything else is on my windows partition
[08:29] <frying_fish> biqut2: don't you actually need to do ssh -X not ssh -Y
[08:29] <ubu> biqut2, did you restart sshd
[08:29] <matkix0s_> When I run nvidia-settings and change them it allows me to save to my x config.... but then i restart x server and no luck.... so I'm thinking its not saving it in the correct location.
[08:29] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: you could try apt-get clean
[08:29] <frying_fish> for x forwarding
[08:29] <ahmed> almimoni: Snyaptic
[08:29] <shea> i loaded a live CD and checked /etc/fstab, /boot/grub/menu.lst, and the grub drive mappings, everything checks out; the UUIDs are correct, the drive mapping is correct.
[08:29] <eck> ubu: i'm not sure what that error message means, but clearly that is the problem
[08:29] <matkix0s_> Any ideas?
[08:29] <deathplanter> eck: where's the log?
[08:29] <ra21vi> almimoni: you can also downlaod the plugins from adobe site, and extract it in ~/.mozilla/path/to/plugin
[08:29] <shea> just wondering if anyone else has seen this error
[08:29] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, i did that and also autoremove
[08:29] <ubu> biqut2, and log out and re-log in
[08:29] <shea> or, whatever it is
[08:29] <eck> deathplanter: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[08:29] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: have you installed lots of packages ?
[08:30] <biqut2> ubu, No i've not restarted sshd
[08:30] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, only beryl and related stuff nothing else
[08:30] <linxeh> biqut2: doh ?
[08:30] <atomiku> I managed to mess up my /boot/ and vmlinuz/initrd.img files, how can I make new ones?
[08:30] <ForzaPalermo> so i odnt know how i can have 5gs almost eaten up on linux partition
[08:30] <robert__> thx but I want the "-sign to be used when I push shift-2... not the -sign which currently gets written in my docs in OpenOffice...
[08:30] <CAiRO> hi
[08:30] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: hmm, did you create a swap file or something ?
[08:30] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, i think so, by default
[08:30] <eck> atomiku: i would try reinstalling the kernel package
[08:30] <Huffalump2> robert__ so you don't mean in a particular document, but in a permanent way to modify the character set?
[08:30] <CAiRO> what can be the cause if the screen stays black after booting the feisty fawn live cd? the graphic cards is a geforce 6600 gt
[08:31] <VR_> how do i add something to the kernel command line?
[08:31] <matkix0s> Anyone willing to help me with a x config issue not keeping my display settings?
[08:31] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: that's a swap partition :)
[08:31] <Marupa> hey everyone, just restarted into feisty, and it came up with the blue 'x cannot start' thing, problem was nvidia driver couldn't load.  It worked perfectly before I rebooted, why is it broken now?
[08:31] <atomiku> eck: how?
[08:31] <biqut2> brb, i'm going to restart and try it, BTW here is the nolisten problem, brandon@h3avyps3:~$ ps aux | grep nolisten
[08:31] <biqut2> root      4647  3.6 15.4  44376 33744 tty7     Ss+  12:51   1:29 /usr/bin/X :0 -br -audit 0 -auth /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth -nolisten tcp vt7

[08:31] <CAiRO> the dapper drake live cd boots fine
[08:31] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, ok so what od i do?
[08:31] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: maybe use the gnome disk usage util or something
[08:31] <eck> VR_: you add it on the grub kernel line
[08:31] <VR_> eck, where's that located?
[08:31] <wheels3572> What happens if you have Gaim open and your doing an upgrade?
[08:31] <Huffalump2> robert__ try #openoffice.org
[08:31] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: or you can do a du -sk / | sort -n
[08:31] <Marupa> wheels3572, nothing.
[08:31] <eck> VR_: in your menu.lst, or if you hit e when you're in the grub screen
[08:31] <VR_> eck, and also, is that permanently there when i add it?
[08:32] <Melvinator> Hey is APT-PROXY supposed to be installed in Dapper?
[08:32] <eck> VR_: to make it permanent you have to do menu.lst
[08:32] <wheels3572> Marupa, will it upgrade Gaim for you if that's the issue?
[08:32] <Jonkka> someway to play a soundile instead of the pc-speaker beep in the gnome-terminal? my laptop doesnt have any pc-speaker >_<
[08:32] <aurelieng> hi, I have a problem with my freshly upgraded dapper to edgy. gnome start, then is killed, and back to gdm. Any idea please ?
[08:32] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, what does that do?
[08:32] <VR_> eck, thanks.  just one more thing... if i want to test it, how do i get to grub?
[08:32] <eck> atomiku: it will be something like linux-image-$(uname -r)
[08:32] <Marupa> wheels3572, gaim is loaded into memory, the executeable can be altered and the loaded instance of gaim won't be affected until you restart it.
[08:32] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: disk usage, summary (in kilobytes) per directory in the directory you give it (ie /)
[08:33] <atomiku> eck: okay one minute :D
[08:33] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: you can then find the biggest, and then work through each until you find out what is eating your space
[08:33] <ubu> eck,  dmesg | grep drm gives me this [   84.008000]  [drm:drm_unlock]  *ERROR* Process 5559 using kernel context 0
[08:33] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, its taking a while
[08:33] <eck> VR_: when you boot up and you're at the grub screen where you choose what kernel/OS to boot, you can hit e and then edit the parameters grub will boot with
[08:33] <atomiku> eck: so I apt-get install it, right?
[08:33] <JanK_> how to see which process locks a file?
[08:33] <Marupa> anyone have any problems with feisty and nvidia?
[08:33] <linxeh> ForzaPalermo: it takes a while to run though as it trawls the directory structure to do it
[08:33] <matkix0s_> When I edit the x config I should save to "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" correct?
[08:33] <VR_> eck, alright, thanks.
[08:33] <wheels3572> Marupa, ok cuz it says close all programs before upgrading to Feisty
[08:33] <Marupa> matkix0s, yes.
[08:33] <ForzaPalermo> linxeh, thanks ill let u know the output
[08:33] <ra21vi> wat about the custom compiled kernel in upgradation? should i remove it and then upgrade...
[08:33] <Dyegov> Hi, I have just installed Feisty and I do not know how to use the 3D cube effect
[08:33] <eck> atomiku: you probably have to reinstall it -- if the files are missing, installing the package will put them there
[08:33] <matkix0s_> Well my settings are not keeping... is there anywhere else I may need to save to?
[08:34] <atomiku> k
[08:34] <DigitalNinja> How are the servers doing on the second day of Feisty Fawn?
[08:34] <Marupa> wheels3572, you're supposed to, but it shouldn't hurt you _too_ bad.  worst thing that can happen is you have to clear gaim's preferences.
[08:34] <atomiku> E: Invalid operation reinstall
[08:34] <ra21vi> Dyegov: go into system->Prefereces, and there enable Desktop Effects
[08:34] <Marupa> DigitalNinja, they're operable.
[08:34] <atomiku> linux-image-2.6.17-10-generic is already the newest version.
[08:34] <atomiku> im currently chrooted though
[08:34] <DigitalNinja> Marupa: Thanks for the info
[08:34] <atomiku> on the 6.10 livecd atm
[08:34] <Dyegov> ra21vi: I have already enabled them, but I do not know how to use the cube
[08:34] <CapaH> I am hoping someone can help me out... I have an ATI card, I just finished installing Feisty from a LIVE CD (iso downloaded from ubuntu.com) --- install went fine, but I had to set the video mode using F4 when the LIVE CD started (I set it to 1024x768) --- but now when I boot the comp, it crashes at the splash screen -- I suspect it due to either video drivers or resolution, but xorg.conf is set to 1024x768 --- any ideas?
[08:34] <eck> ubu: i am not familiar with that error message
[08:35] <DigitalNinja> Marupa: I'm throwing a Feisty Fawn party at our local LUG meeting tonight
[08:35] <wheels3572> Marupa, ok
[08:35] <deobfuscate> So I installed BackTrack2 on my system and it wrote lilo to the MBR. Ubuntu doesn't wanna load up with it can anyone help
[08:35] <Marupa> DigitalNinja, cool. :3
[08:35] <ra21vi> Dyegov: try ctrl+alt+mouse_left and move
[08:35] <eck> atomiku: there is a --reinstall option
[08:35] <ubu> eck: ok thanks for your help
[08:35] <Marupa> This is driving me insane.  I NEED the nvidia drivers and they're crapped up.
[08:35] <atomiku> eck: k
[08:36] <Dyegov> ra21vi: It does not work
[08:36] <atomiku> how do I use it, eck?
[08:36] <matkix0s> Alright... Can someone who uses nvidia drivers tell me how to change the screen settings and have them stick after a x reboot?
=== ubuntu is now known as Miasma-
[08:36] <eck> atomiku: i think apt-get --reinstall install some_package
[08:36] <DODrive>   ...   Feisty ...     ..  17...     ..   ..   ..
[08:36] <Enselic_> Is it possible to reboot from the commandline withouth superuser previliegs?
[08:36] <ra21vi> Dyegov: actually i m on edgy, i cannt test it, i have beryl installed and it works that way
[08:36] <DigitalNinja> matkix0s: They should just work
[08:36] <Marupa> matkix0s, edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf

[08:36] <Dyegov> ra21vi: But I do not have Beryl, it's the one that comes with Feisty
[08:36] <ra21vi> Dyegov: u can also try ctl+alt+left_arrow_button
[08:37] <DigitalNinja> matkix0s: Are you saving the changes
[08:37] <ra21vi> Dyegov: i know....
[08:37] <Eskim0> I have added another partition to my Ubuntu install how do I get it to automount and be R W
[08:37] <eck> Enselic_: no, that would be a major problem
[08:37] <sintflow> l
[08:37] <DODrive> i'm sorry
[08:37] <ra21vi> Dyegov: does it show any effects
[08:37] <compengi> DODrive: zaidi v #ubuntu-ru
[08:37] <DigitalNinja> Eskim0: You need to edit /etc/fstab
[08:37] <Enselic_> Eskim0: edit /etc/mastab
[08:37] <Dyegov> ra21vi: yes, it shows all the opther effects
[08:37] <dhgwill> i'm curious... my update manager is not working the way it ought to. it told me that i could update to feisty once yesterday, and i clicked update and then decided i didn't have enough time. now it won't show me the button again...
[08:37] <Enselic_> Eskim0: edit /etc/mstab
[08:37] <biqut2> ok I'm back
[08:37] <hmpedersen> How to I make feisty mount cds?
[08:37] <Tarkus> LjL: yea, but i want something thats good for organizing music and video, playlists, and also looks good. i have helixplayer, i think thats the opensource version of realplayer, not sure though. and i cant play .mp3 files with it. any suggestions?
[08:37] <Enselic_> Eskim0: edit /etc/fstab    sorry :)

[08:38] <itguru> Is it possible to use a bluetooth headset with ubuntu, instead of headphones?
[08:38] <Dyegov> ra21vi: the ctrl+alt+lest key made everything dissapear, but the cube was not there
[08:38] <Enselic_> eck: what happens when I shutdown trough the System menu then? Some signal is sent to init or something? I mean, I don'tneed to be su to do that
[08:38] <ra21vi> Dyegov: some problem bro, ask who is on Feisty
[08:39] <Dyegov> ra21vi: Ok thanks
[08:39] <deserteagle_> hello all again
[08:39] <Miasma-> Is there a list of bugs discovered since the release of 7.04 anywhere?
[08:39] <Enselic_> Miasma-: check out launchpad
=== deserteagle_ is now known as DesertEagle
[08:39] <eck> Enselic_: GDM runs as root, and i think GDM is configured to accept commands like that from users who have logged in though gdm

[08:39] <ubotu> Miasma-: launchpad is a collection of development services for Open Source projects. It's Ubuntu's Bounty and Bug tracker, and much more; see https://launchpad.net/

[08:39] <DesertEagle> bit tornado :D
[08:39] <Enselic_> eck: ah ok
[08:40] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Get Beryl
[08:40] <DesertEagle> could anyone clue me in as to why the restricted nvidia-glx drivers make the monitor look like its only running 8 colors?
[08:40] <eck> leroi: you might try http://deluge-torrent.org/
[08:40] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: But I have an Nvidia 64MB video card. Don't know if it will work
[08:40] <eck> leroi: the interface looks almost the same as utorrent
[08:40] <DesertEagle> it's really bugging me =(
[08:40] <leroi> i have tried deluge but it just seems so buggy
[08:40] <bebleu> Do you know if there is a howto to install cvscedega 6 ?
[08:40] <leroi> everytime you do something something else goes wrong
[08:41] <eck> leroi: i generally just use rtorrent
[08:41] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: I don't think so
[08:41] <maccam94> bebleu, cvscedega isn't really similar to cedega binaries
[08:41] <mwe> DesertEagle: maybe you need to tweak xorg.conf
[08:41] <eck> it is curses only though
[08:41] <bebleu> ho
[08:41] <DesertEagle> mwe: how so?
[08:41] <s|ver|ight> bebleu, out of curiousity, what game in particular were you looking to run with cedega?
[08:41] <mwe> !nvidia | DesertEagle
[08:41] <ubotu> DesertEagle: To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:41] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Is your video AGP or PCI Express
[08:41] <bebleu> It's because cedega is freezing when I click accept :(
[08:41] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: But would not the effects that come with Feisty work? all the others do, but not the cube
[08:41] <biqut2> ubu, I restarted the local machine and the remote machine and still it wont work, "root@slax:~# kate: cannot connect to X server 192.168.15.100:0"
[08:41] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: It is integrated
[08:41] <mwe> DesertEagle: I think there is some info there. I have an ATI card now
[08:41] <deathplanter> erm, kde behaves weird-it believes 800x600 is the biggest resolution my monitor can take,how to change it?
[08:42] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: It should work. I installed Feisty a few weeks ago on my Lap top
[08:42] <itguru> has anyone been able to get thier bluetooth headset working in ubuntu?
[08:42] <ubu> biqut2, strange
[08:42] <deathplanter> erm, kde behaves weird-it believes 800x600 is the biggest resolution my monitor can take,how to change it?
[08:42] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: The cube thing doesn't work that well
[08:42] <ubu> biqut2, mabe ask #openssh on freenode
[08:42] <biqut2> ubu, ok
[08:42] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: How do I try to use it? I do not even know how to make it appear. What do I have to press?
[08:42] <hmpedersen> How do I get feisty to mount DVD-Roms?
[08:42] <szyjez> hi all
[08:43] <Enselic_> openSUSE has conquered GRUB, when I enter a GRUB shell and tell GRUB to use root (hd0,1) (where my Ubuntu root partion is), the openSUSE boot menu is still there. Is there something I havn't grasped?
[08:43] <Enselic_> !hi | szyjez
[08:43] <ubotu> szyjez: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[08:43] <DesertEagle> mwe: when it sasys to click the add button, what do they mean?
[08:43] <eck> hmpedersen: it should be automounted by gnome, if not you can use the mount command
[08:43] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Did you turn it on using the "Desktop Effects" dialog box
[08:43] <biqut2> ubu, thanx for trying :D
[08:43] <jussi01> Hi all, i have a problem, I tried to install kubuntu desktop, but it stopped at  libavahi-compat-libdnssd1. then it gave me an error and it said something about bonjour, so i tried removing that. but it wouldnt let me. the errors are here: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16620/
[08:43] <DesertEagle> mwe: there's no "Software Preferences" dialog
[08:43] <hmpedersen> eck, I can't.. It's complaining about wrong filesystems..
[08:43] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: Yes, I did, all the other effects work perfectly
[08:43] <Enselic_> jussi01: try #kubuntu
[08:44] <szyjez> i upgradet from edge to fiesty and i got some problems
[08:44] <eck> Enselic_: yes, grub runs in stages :-) it is hard-coded in the mbr where to look for the stage 1.5 files, including menu.lst
[08:44] <radioaktivstorm> hello! im having issues with the 7.04 wireless, it detected my card fine but it doesnt see the wireless network. i tried typing in the eesid but no dice. cna anybody give me som e pointers? (wired works fine thouhg)
[08:44] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: You should have a "pager" in the lower right hand corner of the screen.
[08:44] <Eskim0> what does it mean when you get "unknown mime-type for "/etc/fstab" -- using "application/*""
[08:44] <Enselic_> eck: yeah, but doesn't the root (hd0,1) tell it where to look for menu.lst?
[08:44] <shane634> szyjez, specific question?
[08:44] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: It's just like the virtual desktop pager in a normal window manager
[08:44] <eck> Enselic_: no -- how would it know to read hd0,1 if it can't read the menu.lst?
[08:44] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: I have my 2 workspaces and the bin
[08:45] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Click on it and it should rotate
[08:45] <Enselic_> eck: from what I understand, GRUB is hd aware?
[08:45] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: No, it jost goes from one to another normally
[08:45] <fluid> wish the caps in beryl could be caps
[08:45] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Did you enable the "Cube" effect in the dialog box
[08:45] <Enselic_> eck: doesn't one have to tell it where to find menu.lst?
[08:45] <fluid> err desktops
[08:45] <fluid> lol
[08:45] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: Yes, I did
[08:45] <fluid> brain broke for a second there...
[08:45] <eck> Enselic_: yes, you do that when you install grub onto the mbr
[08:45] <DesertEagle> am i the only one having nvidia driver issues!? O_o
[08:46] <DesertEagle> the screen looks ugly!
[08:46] <DesertEagle> :(
[08:46] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Log out and log back in and see if that does anything
[08:46] <Miasma-> why is`nt there a option to send a window to another workspace ?
[08:46] <shane634> DesertEagle, like what?
[08:46] <s|ver|ight> Enselic_ I had a similar problem with the Windows XP bootloader, and it turned out to be an issue with my BIOS setup -- if you have multiple hard drives, the one that GRUB is on must be booted first.
[08:46] <Dyegov> DigitalNinja: Ok, I will try, be right back
[08:46] <DesertEagle> shane634: screen looks like its only running 8 colors or something
[08:46] <DesertEagle> some color distortion
[08:46] <Enselic_> eck: ok, so to conquer GRUB from SUSE, I need to overwrite the MBR with my own MBR, I can't set the root partion where GRUB should look for menu.lst afterwards?

[08:46] <shane634> DesertEagle, how did you install drivers?

[08:47] <Tremitos> yo
[08:47] <DesertEagle> right now i'm installing the nvidia-glx-dev package along with all its other children
[08:47] <eck> Enselic_: when you install grub you specify the partition that the menu.lst is on, so you need to reinstall grub to point to the ubuntu partition (you can do this in ubuntu or suse, it doesn't matter)

[08:48] <ubotu> To install the Ati/NVidia drivers for your video card, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
[08:48] <EmxBA> I have upgraded feisty on wednesday, last time.
[08:48] <eck> Enselic_: actually, you might need to be in ubuntu to do it
[08:48] <EmxBA> since that there were no upgrades?
[08:48] <eck> Enselic_: if you are in ubuntu (or can chroot into it) you can use grub-install
[08:48] <Enselic_> eck: so the root command (from the GRUB shell) is only local to a particular shell session? I thought that command wrote which partion to look in to the MBR...
[08:48] <shane634> DesertEagle, which driver are you using?
[08:48] <dhgwill> EmxBA: I didn't even do that! I clicked on the upgrade button once out of curiosity and now it won't come back :(
[08:49] <matkix0s> If i edit the xconfig will it mess up beryl?
[08:49] <Enselic_> eck: nah, how could this be Ubuntu specific?
[08:49] <shane634> matkix0s, yes it can
[08:49] <DesertEagle> matkix0s: it shouldn't
[08:49] <matkix0s> Humm
[08:49] <DesertEagle> oh... nvm then
[08:49] <DesertEagle> :P
[08:49] <fluid> why cant beryl set the transparency of xchat?
[08:49] <EmxBA> 1356 nicks? channel's not dropping since feisty released.
[08:49] <matkix0s> okay... well i messed it up then! How can I tell beryl to re-edit it?
[08:49] <idefixx> is there something special this upgrade  tool does? i ran it and checked manually with apt afaics there is no difference. so does it do anything out of the ordinary, non dpkg related?
[08:49] <joeamined> hi everyone

[08:50] <hossy> hi, i'm having some troubles with screen resolution.  i installed ubuntu on an older desktop with an nvidia geforce fx 5200 connected to an lcd tv/monitor that can run 480p or 800x600 via vga.  unbutu is only allowing me to run 640x480, and there's overscan.  how do i fix this?
[08:50] <DigitalNinja> Caramba_: Reboot
[08:50] <student_> hello
[08:50] <eck> Enselic_: if there is a way to specify where to look for the 1.5 files you could do that

[08:50] <Caramba_> digitalninja: been there, done that...no effect :(
[08:50] <eck> Enselic_: i think the default behavior is to just look in /boot/grub/

[08:51] <shane634> DesertEagle, good luck
[08:51] <DesertEagle> thanks! i'll need it :S
[08:51] <student_> EmxBA: I did that already
[08:51] <blocky> anyone ever heard of someone getting a creative x-fi working in linux?
[08:51] <DigitalNinja> Caramba_: Do you have a directory where you want to mount the partition/drive at?
[08:52] <EmxBA> student_: msn.com uses something else than flash? msn.com works for me in firefox
[08:52] <Enselic_> eck: yes, the problem is how to tell GRUB where root is?
[08:52] <blocky> creative and alsa are just pointing at each other
[08:52] <Enselic_> ? -> .
[08:52] <Caramba_> yeah, that's the /media/temp-directory. it exists. And a sudo in front of "mount /dev/sda1 /media/temp" works like a charm

[08:52] <joeamined> how can i make the built in webcam of my HP laptop (dv6000) work in feisty ?
[08:52] <eck> Enselic_: usually if I want to change it and I am not in the correct place, I chroot to the install I want to install it from and run grub-install from the chroot

[08:55] <Caramba_> The file /dev/sda1 has the permissions/flags "brw-rw----" and belongs to root,plugdev. Would this affect the mounting?
[08:55] <hossy> shane634: under device manager it says NV34 [GeForce FX 5200]

[08:55] <Gorila> dont know I installed this last version only a hour ago
[08:56] <hossy> shane634: i'm going to assume generic, this was a clean install that i haven't touched
[08:56] <DigitalNinja> Dyegov: Got the the beryl website and follow the instructions
[08:56] <blocky> is this sound card just plain not supported?
[08:56] <davidwinter> My /home directory is stored on a separate hard drive. if I do a clean install of Feisty, without touching that extra hdd, once set-up, should I have any problems switching over /home to my other hdd?

[08:56] <Gorila> Im running the final version
[08:57] <moxie> Anyone know how to make the update manager follow symbolic links when evaluating free disk space?  It won't upgrade to fiesty because it says it needs more free disk space on /var/cache/apt/archives, but /var/cache/apt is a symlink to a partition with 4GB of free space.

However, I have tried and cannot get Beryl/Compiz to work, even though I have a good computer (2 gigs of ram, ATI Radeon X1600 vid card).  When I go to System -> Preferences -> Desktop Effects and enable desktop effects or whenever I launch Beryl, the screen just goes white (the only thing I can see is my mouse).  Can anyone help?
[09:00] <slyfox> Is it possible to minimize Evolution to tray ?
[09:00] <titun> and the browser plugin is only available for Mac & XP
[09:00] <hossy> shane634: is this on the livecd?
[09:00] <abo> is fiesty out?
[09:00] <shane634> hossy, no envy is not
[09:00] <jay2ania> Kevin: can you boot into livecd with an available burner?
[09:00] <Kevin> abo, yes and dont install it
[09:00] <abo> Kevin, why not?
[09:00] <Kevin> jay2ania yes,
[09:01] <erstazi> during upgrade from Edgy Eft 6.10 to Feisty Fawn 7.04, there is a message for replacing /etc/login.defs, I read that I won't lose any information, is this true?
[09:01] <Kevin> abo, it didnt install properly
[09:01] <moxie> ...or is it possible to force the upgrade manager to start an upgrade, even if it thinks there's not enough disk space?
[09:01] <hossy> shane634: thanks, i'm downloading right now

[09:01] <Lebowski_> I just installed 7.04 on PPC Mac and when I restart I dont get a boot screen... directly boots to OSX
[09:01] <jay2ania> there is a grub livecd/restore cd that lets you boot different partitions, im trying to remember where it was
[09:02] <erstazi> shane634: that's what I figured, but I have to be paranoid with the amount of money on this box.
[09:02] <szyjez> Can I do a reupgrade ? or a fix of distro ?
[09:02] <shane634> hossy, when you get it run sudo envy -g for graphical interface
[09:02] <Kevin> abo, actually it didnt finish installing, and it messed up my partition table, I cant fix it with windows tools
[09:02] <slyfox> mpfeif101: thanks, I am thinking betwen evolution or thunderbird 2. Which one do you use ?

[09:03] <fiXXXerMe1> How do I display the trash folder on the desktop in 7.04?
[09:03] <jay2ania> if you can boot into the livecd, you should be able to look at the partition table with either cfdisk (like DOS fdisk) or the gnome partition tool.
[09:03] <mpfeif101> slyfox: Neither, I use gmail (webmail).  If I am correct, use Evolution if you just want a simple mail client, Thunderbird if you are a more advanced user (and could use the themes/extensions/etc).  Both fundamentally do the same thing tho
[09:03] <DigitalNinja> fiXXXerMel: That's not easy to do

[09:07] <Fe2Cl3> question: can I upgrade from cdrom using the regular cd (not alternate)? if so how :)

[09:07] <Kevin> mpfeif101, i tried installing ubuntu feisty, it quit at about 74% and said the disk was 100% in use, thats all, I rebooted and i can't boot my vista os. I loaded the tools from windows cd and did fixmbr and it wont work. I tried RebuildBcd wich rebuilds the bootloader for windows and it says that it does not recognize aany compatible volumes
[09:07] <furu> any support here?
[09:07] <mpfeif101> True slyfox.  I guess just try both Thunderbird and Evolution and see which one you like better
[09:07] <WaZ`> Fe2Cl3: just put the CD in the tray, it should recognize it as a cd with repositories
[09:07] <ahead> what's wrong
[09:08] <ompaul> DigitalNinja, do a ln -s ~user/.Trash ~user/Desktop/Trash
[09:08] <fiXXXerMe1> DigitalNinja, ompaul:  Found it in my home.
[09:08] <shane634> furu, for what?
[09:08] <DigitalNinja> fiXXXerMel: gconf-editor
[09:08] <fiXXXerMe1> good idea, ompaul
[09:08] <slyfox> mpfeif101: thanks.
[09:08] <Shauny> Hey guys i need help
[09:08] <ompaul> fiXXXerMe1, bad idea you already have it on the bottom right hand corner

[09:08] <fiXXXerMe1> That little thing......
[09:08] <Fe2Cl3> WaZ`: but just installing them thru synaptic is enough? anyway i thought that it isn't (wanted to do it properly with update-manager) closed synaptic and now it won't autorun
[09:08] <underwatercow> if I restart my computer remotely on remote desktop, will I be able to remote or ssh back in once my computer boots to the login screen?
[09:09] <Scunizi> Can any of you lend a hand with getting my atheros wireless working on fiesty xubuntu?  It's recognized, shows up in network manager, and has the restricted drivers activated yet I get nothing. DHCP enabled, hardwired nic card disabled etc..
[09:09] <DigitalNinja> fiXXXerMel: "gconf-editor" is the tool you use to edit the Gnome registry. There is a setting to show the trash, home folder, and computer icon on the desktop
[09:09] <shane634> Scunizi, pastebin iwconfig
[09:09] <WaZ`> Fe2Cl3: what does it say when you try update-manager?
[09:09] <DigitalNinja> fiXXXerMel: It's kind of hard to find the settings because there are so many of them
[09:10] <fiXXXerMe1> That sounds cool.  I want to make this as much like windows for my user as possible.
[09:10] <Shauny> i was on here earlier and told to install pam-mysql for something that i was doing, after downloading it and running ./configure it failed... i will post the log if thats ok?

[09:12] <ubotu> You should avoid changing your nick in a busy channel like #ubuntu - it causes unrequired scrolling which is unfair on new users. The same goes for using noisy away messages (see !Away for more details): use the command "/away <reason>" to set your client away silently

[09:14] <shane634> hossy, cool get the newest one on the site and try again
[09:14] <VSpike> Is there any tool to compare a CD to an ISO, to check it burned right?

[09:15] <ompaul> superbear, changing your nick in a channel with 1k+ resisdents is not good
[09:15] <Lowe> VSpike: while booting the cd, there's an option to check the cd
[09:15] <WaZ`> Gambaroni: depends if you're using radeon driver or fglrx
[09:15] <jrib> Slike: flash and java plugin and wine are headaches on 64bit
[09:15] <superbear> ompaul: ah ok sry

[09:19] <Lowe> WaZ`: fglrx is much faster!

[09:19] <l_r> kahrytan, where?

[09:24] <allquixotic> Does anyone have a suggestion for a good streaming source that works with *Shoutcast* (not just Icecast)? Would like to be able to change the playlist ad-hoc. Using sc_trans_linux now but it is not very friendly
[09:24] <sanityx> When I try to boot the fiesty live cd, after I hit start it does the standard loading bit but instead of getting the splash screen i just get a blank screen and it lasts forever.
[09:25] <Thaurin> Kevin: Why is that?
[09:25] <WaZ`> Gambaroni: try #ubuntu-effects
[09:25] <Okiweb> ringo, I can change to native res, but the problem is that the screen gets strange, like the right part og the screen goes on the left and they are line everywhere, I had no problem with 6.06 or6.10 with my native res
[09:25] <Gambaroni> WaZ` ok..
[09:25] <Pricey> southafrikanse, yes
[09:25] <hendaus> can anyone tell me about a good addon to download videos from youtube?

[09:25] <allquixotic> Scunizi: Do you have personal experience with vlc working with shoutcast?
[09:25] <Kaplan_> but today i can't seem to get any updates
[09:25] <shane634> Scunizi, not showing it connected
[09:25] <ringo> Okiweb: are you doing anything fancy like beryl/compiz?
[09:25] <rambo3> xmms works with shoutcast

[09:25] <mpfeif101> No prob
[09:25] <CapaH> I cannot boot into KDE unless I first take off "splash" during boot --- It will not go into the splash screen. What happens is, at the screen where you choose the OS to boot, as soon as it starts to load the flash screen both monitors go "No signal" and my caps lock+scroll lock keys flash until I reboot. I am using an ATI X800 --- Any help is tremendously appreciated.
[09:26] <southafrikanse> Pricey: But I had to reinstall Ubuntu and now I need to fix it again
[09:26] <Okiweb> ringo, nop I jsut finished my install
[09:26] <PriceChild> southafrikanse, you don't remember how you fixed it? :(
[09:26] <Scunizi> shane634:  yep that's the problem... how do I bring the network down then up?
[09:26] <ringo> Okiweb: Are you using the restricted graphics drivers or open?

[09:28] <sanityx> I can't get feisty booted at all :-( Just a blank screen when the splash screen should appear
[09:28] <jshriver> so I cant move,resize,shrink any of the windows.. but the change screen and eye candy is nice
[09:28] <Kevin> thaurin, are you sure you burned the iso properly?

[09:29] <ringo> hendaus: Video Downloader exension to firefox
[09:29] <hueyg> hendaus I think there is a firefox addon for that
[09:29] <ConstyXIV> hendaus: if you run edgy, democracyplayer
[09:29] <Thaurin> Kevin, oh yes I did. I got it to boot from my DVD writer drive instead, but only in safe mode. Probably nvidia drivers, I guess (GeForece 6800GT)
[09:29] <shane634> hossy, or chipset?
[09:29] <NET||abuse> hmm, i've a collection of mp3's and wma's.,,, obviously i would like to seperate them (die evil wma) rock box isn't playing wma for me ;) so just wondered how can i search on a directory and find all wma's and cut them out to another directory,

[09:33] <SLaPoet> Thaurin:  Yeah, makes things worse that i'm on a laptop so i don't have a video card choice
[09:33] <Scunizi> allquixotic:  here's the quote "You can of course always simply find a link to a radiostream and then open it as you would any other network stream in VLC. But if you would like to browse a list of online radios, you can try the list of shoutcast radio stations VLC can download for you."
[09:33] <shane634> fluid, beryl is beta
[09:33] <Jimbo99> i don't see it listed
[09:33] <PriceChild> BK, yes
[09:33] <Shauny> Is there u GUI for pam-mysql? or is it all through the db?
[09:33] <shane634> !beryl
[09:33] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[09:34] <PriceChild> shane634, not even that
[09:34] <CapaH> If anyone said something directed to me I had to reboot
[09:34] <jrib> Jimbo99: just add the meibuntu repos to your sources.list and you should then have it available in synaptic
[09:34] <shane634> PriceChild, yeah true lol
[09:34] <BK> How do I intagrate WinXP Pro into my 7.04 desktop?
[09:34] <fluid> im running beryl 0.2.0, and i had it enabled before i went from edgy to feisty...so its there somewhere :P
[09:34] <PriceChild> fluid, beryl in #ubuntu-effects please
[09:34] <Thaurin> SLaPoet, tough luck. I've been away from Linux for a couple of years. I had hoped that it would be better now. It is, of course, but not as much as the big commercially supported OS's

[09:35] <riaal> I have an empty (old windows D:) ntfs partion on my main hdd, how do I format it to ext3?
[09:35] <southafrikanse> There is something called qwert list or something
[09:35] <cliebow_> skippy:absolutely id ppc
[09:35] <allquixotic> Scunizi: Ah, you misunderstand me. I am *running a ShoutCast Server* on my local system. However, a shoutcast server alone is insufficient to play a stream. You also need something known as a Shoutcast Source - a program that sends data to the ShoutCast Server. I am looking for programs that people like, which fall into the category of being a ShoutCast Source.
[09:35] <shane634> Scunizi, just change it in the properties
[09:35] <cliebow_> it works great..
[09:35] <skippy> thanks, all.
[09:35] <BK> I thought Feisty came with some kind of program for WinXP preloaded?
[09:35] <cliebow_> skippy
[09:35] <martin__> hi there

[09:35] <djwilcox> anyone know how to delete an smb folder from the desktop
[09:35] <PriceChild> BK, virtualisation?

[09:37] <PriceChild> CirroX, ubuntu has technologies in it which let virtualisation work better. However you need vmware, virtualbox, qemu etc. to virtualise

[09:42] <Shironeko> Is this for Feisty?
[09:42] <sivik> and the thing is, i'm not using kde, gnome, or xubuntu so i don't see the point of installing that crap
[09:42] <vertana> DAUOALAGIO - you can always uninstall it and at the command line type...
[09:43] <Meshezabeel> Shironeko: yes, and any version of ubuntu
[09:43] <delire> CVirus: hmm. there are no other prompts/dialogues hiding behind that window?

[09:46] <cc77> barktpolar, usbdrives should not need packages.
[09:46] <cliebow_> aburton: havnt anything else to try do you?i see those crc errors and something back inmy brain syas ive been there before
[09:47] <barktpolar> Well, mine's is not being recognized
[09:47] <vertana> @dauoalagio2 If x does not restart simply upgrade like you would on a command line with those commands I gave you, and then when all is said and done, restart, if it does not then do "sudo aptitude install nvidia-glx", when that is done, then type "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and find where it tells you the driver it'll look like "Driver     "whatever"  and change whatever to "nvidia"
[09:47] <Draconicus> The automount features in feisty are interfering with K3B's ability to check its own writing. Is there a way to disable it for specific instances while still having it for general use?

[09:55] <PriceChild> HELPMEEE, where doesn't it appear?
[09:55] <Solver> hi all
[09:56] <Kaplan_> i mean highlight the name i send to
[09:56] <HELPMEEE> PriceChild: Network tools, Networking... cannot connect to internet
[09:56] <HELPMEEE> I am on my desktop
[09:56] <eternaljoy> is there any way to make Ubuntu think I have more RAM installed than I really have using a RAM USB stick or something?  does something like that exist?
[09:56] <Solver> Hey, "suspend" under Dapper warning of corruption.  How bad is this problem?
[09:56] <gravemind> how do I use xrandr to get screen res back to normal after using wine?
[09:56] <Lunar_Lamp> How do I get a kernel module to autoload on boot?
[09:56] <Lin> heya..
[09:56] <ScottLij> how do I list all hard drive partitions? (including multiple hard drives and NTFS partitions)
[09:56] <vertana> I do not know how to do that on Xchat (which I assume you are using)
[09:56] <Solver> I've been using hibernate on wife's lappie but she's sick of how slow it is :)
[09:56] <Solver> ScottLij: /sbin/fdisk -l  ?
[09:57] <vertana> type in terminal "fdisk -l"
[09:57] <PriceChild> Kaplan_, say their name in the message
[09:57] <vertana> that will list all hard drives and all partitions
[09:57] <delire> Lunar_Lamp: you can add it to your /etc/modules file
[09:57] <hmpedersen> That's better..
[09:57] <Thaurin> Anybody else having trouble with no signal to monitor with the NVIDIA driver?
[09:57] <cliebow_> aburton:im heading home..if you want to try one of those other channels....i usually stick foot in mouth and one of the masters corrects me
[09:57] <Lin> Anyone else report that prefered browser isn't respected? my alternatives point to epiphany same to my preferred applications. But when I double click some URL on desktop, firefox is opened, why this is happening?
[09:57] <vertana> I did once upon a time, what version and did you try to upgrade or anything?
[09:57] <delire> Lunar_Lamp: Ubuntu may not have a GUI way, i'm not sure.
[09:57] <Kaplan_> but xchat is not giving m the names
[09:57] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, For what purpose? You can put a swap file on a thumb drive if you want.
[09:57] <Jordan_U> ScottLij, sudo fdisk -l
[09:57] <Kaplan_> like in autotext mode
[09:57] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, For what purpose? You can put a swap file on a thumb drive if you want.
[09:57] <Jordan_U> ScottLij, sudo fdisk -l
[09:58] <delire> Lunar_Lamp: *now have a GUI way, i meant.
[09:58] <ptsougk> hi
[09:58] <ScottLij> Thanks
[09:58] <dave57> hello
[09:58] <BK> Thank you so much Jordan-U, I will see if it works. 1 second please.
[09:58] <cliebow_> Kaplan:sure you dont just need to move the window around?
[09:58] <ptsougk> Can anyone know how to setup my wifi network card???
[09:58] <Lunar_Lamp> delire, aha, /etc/modules that's the fellah!  I couldn't remember the file. Very obvious now though :-$  Just threw a blank
[09:58] <dave57> what type of network card is it?
[09:58] <ptsougk> i have Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection
[09:58] <hossosor> shane634: thanks for the help thus far, i'm working on the ndiswrapper situation at the moment
[09:58] <eck> Lin: some applications to not use the gnome settings to choose what application to launch, and they will not respect the preferred applications settings you use
[09:58] <eternaljoy> Jordan_U: if I install another physical 1 GIG RAM on my PC, performance will improve, thats why
[09:58] <dave57> have youtried using NDISWRAPPER
[09:58] <shane634> hossosor, cool
[09:59] <delire> Lunar_Lamp: no worries, hope it works
[09:59] <eck> Lin: anything that is a gnome application should work though
[09:59] <dave57> if all else fails you can use the linuxant driverloader program from www.linuxant.com
[09:59] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, But if you don't have another 1 GIG of actual RAM what is going to change if Ubuntu thinks you do?
[09:59] <Lunar_Lamp> delire, yes, it will do :-)  Just couldn't remember the file to edit :-)
[09:59] <dave57> howevertheychargefor it
[09:59] <delire> Lunar_Lamp: happens all the time
[09:59] <eternaljoy> Jordan_U: using HDD is not as fast as physical RAM
[10:00] <Fathefner> i just upgraded to ubuntu fawn but in edgy i could see my nfts drive now i cant
[10:00] <sand_storm> hi, i cant set my screen resolution on its highest it is set to 1*** x 7** can anyone help plz
[10:00] <nicolah> I'm looking for a way to "print" to a file the list of folders, subfolders and files of a specific path. any idea ? thanks
[10:00] <eternaljoy> Fathefner: I did

[10:00] <sand_storm> i tried the terminal thing
[10:00] <Kaplan_> PriceChild dos this highlight?
[10:00] <eternaljoy> Fathefner: I installed fesity yesterday and it sees my NTFS drives
[10:00] <Fathefner> i did what
[10:00] <delire> ptsougk: have you looked at the Restricted Driver Manager?
[10:00] <dave57> you will have edit your Xorg file.
[10:00] <OiPenguinn> As a totalt newbie, since the release of Feisty, I'm struggeling to increase the resolution of my monitor. The current maximum is 1024 x 768 which is useless on a 19'' screen. There's no further option in System --> Preferences --> Screen resolution and I've downloaded the Nvidia driver. Is there any solution? This is essential to convince my wife that a switch from xp is worth a try.
[10:00] <sand_storm> but it doesnt have the resolution
[10:00] <jvm_> hi. i upgraded to xorg 7.2 and it broke my xinerama configuration. any hint why?
[10:00] <Fathefner> what program r u using
[10:00] <martin__> hi there
[10:00] <Thaurin> nv driver doesn't work with my GeForce 6800GT. Known problem?
[10:00] <eck> nicolah: i would just use ls -lR or the tree command and redirect it to a file
[10:01] <martin__> I just upgrade my home-lan ubuntu server to feisty
[10:01] <yeniklasor> Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/multiverse/source/Sources.gz Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)
[10:01] <Huffalump2> fathefner, ntfs-3g, remember? :)  it works great
[10:01] <eternaljoy> Fathefner: but it wont see your NTFS drives if your NTFS drives have not been shut down properly
[10:01] <dave57> okay what is your highest res possible on the19incher
[10:01] <_jonathan_> hello people, when I try a .vob file (dvd) totem shuts down before playing, Xserver gives this error: BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
[10:01] <_jonathan_> I know I have a bad graphics card, but I've played .vob files fine, in the past
[10:01] <ptsougk> delire:No, now i download the package
[10:01] <Lin> eck: double click on desktop (nautilus) should launch epiphany, but didn't open
[10:01] <sanityx> Both the Feisty live cd and the Alternate Install CD hang after detecting my cd-rom drive as hda and loading the "uniform cdrom device driver"
[10:01] <Fathefner> ntfs isnt workin
[10:01] <martin__> at some point my notebook gets disalbed and on reconnect via network-manager I get an ipv6 adress
[10:01] <delire> ptsougk: go to system-->administration-->restricted driver manager
[10:01] <Kaplan_> how do i send a highlighted message to someone?????????
[10:01] <gravemind> you can't download the feisty cd with bittorrent anymore?
[10:01] <Fathefner> ntfs-3g isnt workin
[10:01] <martin__> and I cannot use the internet anymore
[10:01] <delire> ptsougk: see if there is mention in there of that card.
[10:01] <Huffalump2> Kaplan_ by adding more questions marks.
[10:01] <eck> Lin: you might have to log out and log back in, i'm not sure
[10:01] <Fathefner> the tutorial wasnt helpin
[10:01] <southafrikanse> THis is no one who can help me with my sound problem?
[10:02] <martin__> what did I do wrong?
[10:02] <shwag> which wireless usb adapter is best supported in linux ?

[10:02] <Lin> eck: didn't worked
[10:02] <Huffalump2> fathefner, lies!  what happened when you tried ntfs-3g?
[10:02] <HELPMEEE> my wireless card disappeared after reboot, anyone help?
[10:02] <sand_storm> i use nvidia 7600 gs
[10:02] <_jonathan_> hello people, when I try a .vob file (dvd) totem shuts down before playing, Xserver gives this error: BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
[10:02] <_jonathan_> I know I have a bad graphics card, but I've played .vob files fine, in the past
[10:02] <_jonathan_> Is there a solution for this?
[10:02] <Fathefner> i never did anything
[10:02] <Fathefner> it
[10:02] <yeniklasor> A problem occured during the update. This is usually some sort of network problem, please check your network connection and retry.
[10:02] <Huffalump2> !fixres > sand_storm
[10:02] <Kaplan_> Huffalamp, how did you do that?
[10:02] <hossosor> shane634: this is going to sound ridiculous, but could you possibly download the zip and send me the .inf?  the file is only 17mb but one of my roomates is tieing up all of the bandwidth.  it keeps killing the download.
[10:02] <PriceChild> Kaplan_, yeah that hilighted
[10:03] <southafrikanse> !sound > southafrikanse
[10:03] <Huffalump2> kaplan_ put their name in the text
[10:03] <Huffalump2> fathefner, did you install it via Synaptic or apt-get or how?
[10:03] <Kaplan_> Bt it should auto finish the name in xchat
[10:03] <Kaplan_> and it is not
[10:03] <Fathefner> synaptic
[10:03] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, So are you trying to use a flash drive for SWAP?
[10:03] <PriceChild> Kaplan_, type the first letters then <tab>
[10:03] <Huffalump2> kaplan_ then type it all the way out
[10:03] <SnakePlisken> OiPenguinn tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[10:04] <eck> Lin: i'm not really sure what the problem could be. it is possible to create a defaults file somewhere in .local to manually register the preferred MIME handlers
[10:04] <shane634> hossosor, haha you need to message me on a diff messenger and we can make it work
[10:04] <tehquickness> is there a way to delete all the files that I have found with locate?
[10:04] <Kaplan_> PriceChild: Thanks a lot
[10:04] <hossosor> shane634: thanks, i'll see what i can do, brb
[10:04] <Lin> eck: Im not sure too. where can I find these .locals?
[10:04] <Teres__> hi. im trying to play starcraft on my linux machine through wine. it was working before but now when i run it the screen of it is small and i cant make it fullscreen. wat should i do?
[10:04] <Kaplan_> PriceChild: is this private message?
[10:04] <PriceChild> Kaplan_, no
[10:04] <Jordan_U> tehquickness, Yes, rm -i `locate whatever`
[10:04] <OiPenguinn> SnakePlisken: Never heard of it. I'll do a search, or can you direct me?
[10:04] <HELPMEEE> I get "No Such Device" when I search for eth1
[10:04] <HELPMEEE> HELP?
[10:04] <eternaljoy> Jordan_U: no
[10:04] <HELPMEEE> It worked on initial install
[10:04] <Huffalump2> fathefner and where is your ntfs drive?  /hda/???
[10:05] <eternaljoy> Jordan_U: I already have a swap partition on my HDD
[10:05] <hendaus> helpers when i open democarcy tv player --> An unknown error has occurred while finishing starting up , can anyone help
[10:05] <eck> Lin: http://www.gnome.org/learn/admin-guide/latest/mimetypes-registering.html
[10:05] <Teres_> so wat should i do to resolve my problem?
[10:05] <sanityx> Grr I'm never going to get feisty installed
[10:05] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: /hda/da200
[10:05] <hossy> shane634: it's sad when i have to steal the neighbors' internet because mine is being killed by one of my roomates
[10:05] <eck> Lin: although you might just ask on irc.gnome.org
[10:05] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, Are you trying to get Ubuntu to recognize that you have more physical RAM?
[10:05] <tehquickness> Jordan_u, it says the argument list is too long
[10:05] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: /hda/??? what goes there
[10:05] <Huffalump2> fathefner okay.  make a directory /mnt/
[10:05] <shane634> hossy,  yeah i know lol
[10:06] <winterborne> Does anybody have experience using Gnome across multiple monitors? (I've already got the X.org settings right, everything works, I just want to tweak it.)
[10:06] <SnakePlisken> type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg in terminal...just hit enter for all the defaults till you get to available screen resoulutions then choose what you want
[10:06] <Kaplan_> PriceChild: just a way to get someones attention
[10:06] <Kaplan_> PriceChild: tx a lot :)
[10:06] <eternaljoy> Jordan_U: is that possible without actually placing more physical RAM into my PC?
[10:06] <tehquickness> Jordan_u, sudo rm -idR `locate vmware`
[10:06] <Huffalump2> fathefner, my stumbling block in following the tutorial was I didn't (at first) realize the need to create the /mnt/ directory.  Do that and we'll move on to making it work gloriously for you
=== [acid] Neatchee__ is now known as [acid] Neatchee
[10:06] <Jordan_U> tehquickness, You can try without the -i ( interactive, will ask yo if you are sure )
[10:06] <Lin> eck: they say: seems like an ubuntu problem..
[10:07] <Fathefner> what is a /mnt/
[10:07] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, How would it be?
[10:07] <what_if> how do I prevent a module from loading at boot ??
[10:07] <tehquickness> Jordan_u, even that will not work hmmm
[10:07] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, If you don't have it you don't have it?
[10:07] <MalconRox> I m having problems with my sound card: Realtek acl660. What can i do?
[10:07] <PriceChild> Huffalump2, don't mount on /mnt/ do it somewhere like /mnt/foo or /media/foo
[10:07] <styvy> HELPMEEE, do you have two networkcards? the first one is eth0, the second one eth1
[10:07] <Huffalump2> fathefner, you want to make a directory off the file system root (/) called "mnt" (that's the name of the folder)
[10:07] <craigp84> Any major issues surfacing yet from the new release? - just before i upgrade :-)
[10:07] <eternaljoy> Jordan_U: I seen them sell USB 1GIG sticks that apparetly fools the PC into thinking you installed another 1 GIG physical RAM
[10:07] <Fathefner> ok will do
[10:07] <Huffalump2> PriceChild, I'm with ya... one step at a time, though
[10:07] <hendaus> somobody help me please!
[10:07] <Jordan_U> what_if, You need to blacklist it
[10:08] <PriceChild> eternaljoy, you can use flash drives as ram
[10:08] <PriceChild> eternaljoy, well swap
[10:08] <what_if> Jordan_U: is that a full blacklist or just a boottime blacklist, it needs to load later
[10:08] <allquixotic> Scunizi: I found a solution to my problem, a very good one. idjc (Internet DJ Control) is an *excellent* streamer that supports ShoutCast :) I am running JACK on top of dmix in non-realtime, high-latency mode (which is OK for this application) to host the stream. http://sheltered.hobby-site.com:8000/listen.pls :D
[10:08] <OiPenguinn> SnakePlisken: I believe I have an ATI card, however I'm asked to type an identifier of my video card. Where do I find this with certainty?
[10:08] <airmikey> anyone here have a problem with , pan  crashing
[10:09] <what_if> Jordan_U: if my nvidia module loads at boot, X fails to start, if I rmmod, then modprobe it. X works Fine
[10:09] <sanityx> Any idea why feisty would hang in both the alternate install and live cds after detecting the cdrom as hda
[10:09] <eternaljoy> PriceChild: I alraady have a 700MB linux swap partiton on my HDD.  Is that the same thing as  these USB sticks that they claim will fool my PC into thinking I added another physical 1 Gig RAM?
[10:09] <Fathefner> ok i made an mnt
[10:09] <Huffalump2> fathefner, now how many ntfs drives do we want to mount here?  only one or multiple?
[10:09] <PriceChild> eternaljoy, basically yes
[10:09] <Jordan_U> eternaljoy, And if those do anything they either actually use them for swap or slow your machine down incredibly because what your machine thinks is RAM ( incredibly fast ) is actually just flash ( faster than HDD but still slow )
[10:09] <SnakePlisken> cant help you there....i just hit enter for everything till i get to screen resolutions. sorry man
[10:09] <Fathefner> 2
[10:09] <Teres_> i really am havinjg a problem with starcraft on wine...can anyone help?
[10:09] <Huffalump2> fathefner, for each drive you want to mount, create a folder/directory inside of /mnt/  such as... /mnt/windows_C  or  /mnt/mynetworkdrive etc
[10:09] <Scunizi> allquixotic:  listing now.. cool.. nice job.
[10:09] <OiPenguinn> SnakePlisken: I'll give that a go then.
[10:10] <silver6> Teres_, whats the problem. i got it working first try
[10:10] <PriceChild> eternaljoy, basically you can create a swap file on the flash disk. Windows does the same thing with it pagefiles in vista
[10:10] <Scunizi> allquixotic:  it's a little overdriven.. litte distortion.
[10:10] <Huffalump2> fathefner, I had three.  What I did, for example, was windows_C, windows_F, and windows_H but you use whatever makes sense to you
[10:10] <allquixotic> Scunizi: Will work on that - you may notice a difference within 2 minutes ;)
[10:10] <Scunizi> k
[10:10] <Jordan_U> what_if, is it from the repos or from Nvidia.com?
[10:10] <Teres_> i also did...but now when i start it it is in a small window and i cant get it fullscreen
[10:10] <Fathefner> i cant make a folder
[10:10] <what_if> Jordan_U: nvidia.com
[10:10] <eternaljoy> PriceChild: ah ok!  so it seems these "new" RAM USB drives are all just a markering SCAM
[10:11] <_jonathan_> when I try a .vob file (dvd) totem shuts down before playing, Xserver gives this error: BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
[10:11] <_jonathan_> I know I have a bad graphics card, but I've played .vob files fine, in the past,
[10:11] <_jonathan_> Is there a solution for this?
[10:11] <piglit> when i trie to install ubuntu 7.04 i get the first install screen and then when i hit enter to install ubuntu the cd drive starts and afther a while nothing happens and the system freezes ... i get no (error) mesages whatsoever Question1: how can i show the error mesages (2) how can i disable DMA when installing ubuntu ???
[10:11] <sanityx> Oh well. I guess I'll just have to wait for gusty gibbon
[10:11] <MalconRox> I m having problems with my sound card: Realtek acl660. What can i do?
[10:11] <sanityx> piglit, I have exactley the same issue.
[10:11] <ApesMa> I'm now running w/feisty (yay!) but having trouble installing nvidia-glx-new. It complains about a diversion by nvidia-glx... but I've uninstalled nvidia-glx! What can I do?
[10:11] <PriceChild> eternaljoy, i may be wrong... but afaik yes
[10:11] <silver6> Teres_, yeah i had some screen resolution issues too, can't really help
[10:11] <allquixotic> Scunizi: It has real-time monitoring so I don't have to wait for my changes in volume to take effect - I can see now that it's not overdriven anymore, really. Do you agree...?
[10:11] <Xecuter88> Hi! i was wondering if the desktop effekts that where indroduced with 7.04 works with ati graphics cards?
[10:11] <eternaljoy> PriceChild: ok cheers
[10:11] <Fathefner> it told me i dont have permissions
[10:11] <sanityx> piglit, If you press F6 on the boot options screen and then remove the "quiet" and "splash" lines, you acn see whats happening. But you wont get errors. It will just hang after detecting cdrom
[10:11] <JR> does anyone know any good audio recording software? (apart from audacity and ardour)
[10:12] <OiPenguinn> SnakePlisken: I'm stuck at the third window. "Users of PowerPC machines, and users..." There's no way to highlight the 'ok'!
[10:12] <Teres_> but like the screen thinks its full but i can move the mouse out and then the screen scrolls out of starcraft...its so wierd
[10:12] <what_if> Jordan_U: I put rmmod nvidia in rc.loacl, going to reboot and see it that fixes it
[10:12] <Jordan_U> what_if, It sounds like a conflict between the ones you installed from Nvidia.com and the ones in the repos, did you blacklist the ones from the repos ( should have been one of the steps in whatever guide you followed ) ?
[10:12] <Huffalump2> fathefner, open up a terminal
[10:12] <Teres_> wat did u do bout ur issues?
[10:12] <kc> For some reason my "cube desktop" has stopped working, wobbly windows is fine still tho, any suggestions reasons? its enabled in desktop effects
[10:12] <Fathefner> ok
[10:12] <styvy> JR: krecord
[10:12] <Huffalump2> fathefner, we'll do a line command:  sudo mkdir /mnt/windows_C (or whatever your name is)
[10:12] <Fathefner> i have
[10:12] <lomez> how much of a pain in the ass is it to get AIGLX/COmpiz working with an ATI card using FGLRX drivers
[10:12] <silver6> yeah i had that problem too. i never solved it, just booted back to windows when i wanted to play
[10:12] <PriceChild> lomez, impossible
[10:12] <lomez> really?
[10:12] <what_if> Jordan_U: followed no guide, installed no ubuntu-nvidia drivers
[10:12] <lomez> no composite at all yet :/ ?
[10:12] <PriceChild> lomez, fglrx won't work on aiglx. You need to use xgl
[10:12] <Jordan_U> lomez, Only XGL will work with fglrx
[10:12] <eck> JR: you might try jokosher it is sort of canonical sponsored
[10:13] <PriceChild> lomez, #ubuntu-effects
[10:13] <what_if> I'll brb
[10:13] <piglit> thhanx sanityx
[10:13] <shane634> lomez, it is possible with many hours of your time and others
[10:13] <eck> i think the developer is a canonical employee, or something like that
=== Carnage` is now known as Carnage\
[10:13] <eck> JR: it looks pretty cool
[10:13] <Fathefner> ok done
[10:13] <PriceChild> eck, jono bacon is a canonical employee - ubuntu community manager
[10:13] <ryeth25> canonical?    could u define
[10:13] <lomez> oh ok, i heard the opposite
[10:13] <delire> JR: people are saying good things about jokosher
[10:13] <lomez> so XGL/Compiz on ATI, does it work alright or is it not worth the trouble?
[10:13] <huma> has anyone tried bluez-btsco 0.50 on 7.04?
[10:13] <SnakePlisken> do a google search for  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg....read up on it...cant help you anymore than that bro
[10:13] <MalconRox> no help to me... thanks anyway.. have to go now...
[10:13] <piglit> sanityx: what did you do to solve the problem?
[10:14] <shane634> lomez, beryl is alpha man and buggy
[10:14] <JR> <delire>, thanks that looks great :)
[10:14] <lomez> well right but how about compiz
[10:14] <OiPenguinn> SnakePlisken: Ok. Is it safe to close the terminal window now?
[10:14] <Jordan_U> what_if: then that is your problem, let me find a guide ( if you have the restricted modules, you need to blacklist the driver )
[10:14] <eck> !canonical > ryeth25
[10:14] <lomez> compiz is more stable than beryl
[10:14] <shane634> lomez, buggy
[10:14] <delire> JR: http://www.jokosher.org/
[10:14] <mrec> beryl looks better :)
[10:14] <lomez> too buggy to try?
[10:14] <hendaus> somobody help me please!
[10:14] <SnakePlisken> should be
[10:14] <Fathefner> ok i have named it
[10:15] <shane634> lomez, your machine man break it if you wish
[10:15] <lomez> fair enough
[10:15] <Huffalump2> ok, fathefner, now let's mount a drive in terminal:  /dev/hda/xxx /mnt/windows_C ntfs-3g
[10:15] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: ok its named
[10:15] <lomez> shane634, thanks
[10:15] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: what is the xxx
[10:15] <zzz_>  #pardus
[10:15] <styvy> ryeth25, canonical is the company that develops ubuntu
[10:15] <shane634> lomez, only my opinion mate
[10:15] <Huffalump2> fathefner the correct info for your drive
[10:15] <Fathefner> like the name
[10:15] <tunganet> Do i have to reinstall my video driver if i upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04? (i installed nvidia drivers thru envy script)
[10:16] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: like the name of the drive
[10:16] <shane634> tunganet, yes
[10:16] <PriceChild> tunganet, probably yes
[10:16] <LjL> tunganet: most likely
[10:16] <Huffalump2> fathefner /dev/hda/da200
[10:16] <tunganet> thanks
[10:16] <eternaljoy> whats the difference between a hard disk drives seek time and data transfer rate?
[10:16] <Jordan_U> what_if: are you using Edgy or Feisty?
[10:16] <Scunizi> allquixotic:  sorry been bouncing between two different machines in two locations trying to get wireless working with shane634.  Much better now.  Can you drop the level on 50-100hz take some of the base out?
[10:16] <PriceChild> tunganet, because you will have a new kernel
[10:16] <tunganet> i hope it wouldn't be a hazle
[10:16] <Fathefner> ok
[10:16] <flodine> can i get help with fontconfig configuration please
[10:16] <PriceChild> tunganet, switch to vesa then use the restricted-manager
[10:16] <eck> eternaljoy: do you know how a hard drive works?
[10:16] <shane634> Scunizi, yes you can
[10:16] <Huffalump2> fathefner does that look right?  so, /dev/hda/da200 /mnt/windows_C ntfs-3g
[10:16] <tunganet> PriceChild: hmm okay
[10:16] <what_if> Jordan_U: I put "rmmod nvidia" in rc.local and everything works fine now... a hack but a working hack
[10:16] <begleysm> im still in 6.10... but i have a 3 monitor setup and my middle monitor is stuck at 800x600 resolution even though xorg.conf only has 1280x1024 as an option... any ideas?
[10:17] <Nrbelex> Hi, Inside my Dell 8200 is a Dell Truemobile 1180 aka BCM4303 wireless card. When I use the Network Manager, nothing is detected though I know two wireless networks are present (another computer one foot away has a strong connection on one of the two and an OK connection on the other). Any thoughts?
[10:17] <Fathefner> bash: /dev/hda/da200: No such file or directory
[10:17] <eternaljoy> eck: do you?
[10:17] <eck> eternaljoy: the seek time is the time it takes for the head to move across the platter
[10:17] <shane634> begleysm, the monitor can't handle it
[10:17] <Huffalump2> fathefner, sorry I got ahead of myself.  We want that command later when you automount.  My mistake.
[10:17] <Jordan_U> tunganet, I would personally remove what envy installed and use the drivers from the repos, in Feisty they couldn't be easier to install and you won't have upgrade problems later on
[10:17] <flodine> can someone tell me what fonts show better bitstream or truetype
[10:17] <eck> eternaljoy: it doesn't make a lot of sense unless you sort of understand what is going on
[10:17] <allquixotic> Scunizi: Not sure if it has an equalizer, but it does have about everything else, lol
[10:17] <jcreedy2> Can anyone very experienced with an install with an ATI Radeon card PM me, I can't even get installer to start
[10:17] <eck> eternaljoy: seek time is like latency, transfer rate is like bandwidth
[10:17] <tunganet> Jordan_U: is it really easy to install nvidia drivers without envy script in feisty?
[10:17] <Fathefner> ok
[10:17] <tom_> Can someone help me get my resolution changed and get electric sheep installed please? I just finished getting beryl up and running
[10:17] <Huffalump2> fathefner, sudo mount /dev/hda/da200 /mnt/windows_C
[10:17] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: ok
[10:18] <AlbertoP> hello
[10:18] <AATDark> jcreedy2: what is the error message ?
[10:18] <jcreedy2> no error message
[10:18] <Jordan_U> tunganet, Yup, just a checkbox :)
[10:18] <begleysm> shane634, it can handle it, it does in windows XP and it DID in ubuntu... just one day i started up ubuntu (i made no changes to xorg.conf) and its resolution was wrong
[10:18] <tunganet> Jordan_U: oh my.. nice!
[10:18] <nickuzzy> my xserver is crashing upon startup
[10:18] <phoenix_G> anyone made atheros chipset device work on feisty ?
[10:18] <jcreedy2> I get to the front screen, i go to start or install ubuntu, then get a black screen
[10:18] <Jordan_U> tunganet, But it won't work until you undu what envy did.
[10:18] <ejoy> eck: ah ok cheers.  I read that a HDD has faster data transfer rate than a USB flash drive has.  But the USB flash drives seek time is faster!  is that true?
[10:18] <what_if> I there a seveas repository for feisty yet ??
[10:18] <ammiel> Is there a way I can make ubuntu go back to the old style of mounting (so the drive always mounts on /media/cdrom0 or /media/cdrom1 and not something such as /mnt/STARCRAFT)
[10:18] <tunganet> Jordan_U: hmm so other data i have on 6.10 will get transfered nicely, and the only thing i need to do before i upgrade is to uninstall the envy right?
[10:18] <jcreedy2> i went to graphics-safe install, showed loading screen for a while, then stopped outputting to monitor completely
[10:19] <Jordan_U> tunganet, Yup
[10:19] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: mount: special device /dev/hda/da200 does not exist
[10:19] <Seveas> what_if, no :)
[10:19] <tunganet> Jordan_U: none of those WINE stuff needs any work right
[10:19] <eck> ejoy: yes. because a hard drive needs to physically move a head across the platter to seek to a location on the disk, but a flash drive is not mechanical so it can just address any part of it directly
[10:19] <Huffalump2> fathefner, how many partitions are on hda?
[10:19] <Nrbelex> Inside my Dell Inspiron 8200 is a Dell Truemobile 1180 aka BCM4303 wireless card.

[10:19] <jcreedy2> no, i do not
[10:19] <mfyz> hi. my ubuntu broked after kernel update.. i have changed UUIDs to /dev/hda... and kernel not booting... i'm waiting 4-5 minutes and usplash change to some errors. error says /dev/hda2 not fount.. but grub, fstab,, all my root filesystem in /dev/hda2/// what must i do
[10:19] <phoenix_G> madwifi works for atheros ?
[10:19] <what_if> Seveas: oh, well hi :) and TY for the edgy version, spot on :)
[10:20] <Fathefner> i havent partioned any of my windows drives
[10:20] <Huffalump2> ok, we'll identify the correct number, fathefner.  just a moment.
[10:20] <jcreedy2> i was wondering if i needed to get the driver CD and try to install with that
[10:20] <Huffalump2> none?
[10:20] <jcreedy2> but i just downloaded this version now, and it's the latest
[10:20] <ejoy> eck: how do these little 1 GIG USB drives work?  Do they have a little hdd in them?

[10:23] <ubotu> !GTK and !Qt are !GUI toolkits (i.e. software libraries that draw buttons, textboxes, etc). !GNOME, !KDE, !Xfce and friends are "desktop environments", which build on top of such libraries to provide a "consistent" desktop experience. !Kubuntu and !Xubuntu are simply flavors of Ubuntu that come with KDE and Xfce (respectively) installed as default, instead of GNOME.

[10:27] <LjL> tom__: i wonder how that's possible. you can always restore your previous X configuration from the terminal. just type  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup  before doing anything, and then if you have trouble, login to the terminal, and type  sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf .   it's certainly always a good idea to make a backup of things you edit

[10:28] <Jordan_U> markus_, Yes, do you know how to chroot? ( and how to bind /dev and /proc ) ?
[10:29] <Nrbelex> nuOpus, what did you have to do and is it a BCM4303?
[10:29] <oneseventeen> I changed my IP from dhcp to static using the GUI but it didn't apply it... how do I get my networking systems to implement my new IP settings?
[10:29] <nuOpus> I had to remove the bcm43xx module that is loaded at start, then use NDISWRAPPER with the windows drivers
[10:29] <jrib> xtknight: * does not glob things that start with a .
[10:29] <cedricshock> Is there anything I can do to get the live CD to run with about 224 MB of memory? I have another memory stick, but it's got bad spots.
[10:29] <Mr_Bunny_> What's the default home directory for the Java2 SDK 1.4.2?
[10:29] <nuOpus> yes
[10:29] <markus_> Jordan_U, yes thanks... done it before
[10:29] <AATDark> ernstan: layout : no ; new kernel ; new openoffec ; xserver .. + network manager
[10:29] <oneseventeen> (/etc/networking/interfaces has the correct IP)
[10:29] <AATDark> ernstan: nothing big i would say ..
[10:29] <Nrbelex> nuOpus, any way to do it without NDISWrapper?
[10:29] <LjL> cedricshock: the live CD should definitely work with 224 MB of memory. (what do memory sticks have to do with it?)
[10:29] <nuOpus> ndiswrapper won't work at first because bcm43xx is loaded first
[10:29] <sls_> Is there a good guide to setingup pam_mount? I really want to set it up to mount : volume * smb hathor & /home/HADES/& uid=&,gid=&,dmask=0750,workgroup=HADES - - (except that it does not work at all! This is how I understand that the man page wants me to do it... ideas??)
[10:29] <Jordan_U> Nrbelex, Yes, are you on Edgy or Feisty?
[10:29] <nuOpus> dont know. but it is working perfectly
[10:29] <nickuzzy> Huffalump, the error occurs even when I try to run the live cd... im guess I should probably just go back to 6.10
[10:29] <AATDark> cedricshock there is a xubuntu .. with doesn't so much mem
[10:29] <kane77> cedricshock, try xubuntu
[10:30] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, Feisty
[10:30] <LjL> cedricshock: ah you mean RAM stick, i was thinking USB stick sorry, i'm stoned
[10:30] <Huffalump> fathefner, these are USB drives?
[10:30] <cedricshock> LjL: They let me have more memory. It certainly doesn't work with 224.
[10:30] <nuOpus> I just need to figure out how to stop the module from loading when I boot
[10:30] <mfyz> LjL: how can i generate UUIDs?
[10:30] <delire> ernstan: migration assistant, codec installation on filetype, network manager, nvidia/ati magic, improved wifi support..
[10:30] <LjL> cedricshock: but anyway, the CD can run with 192MB in my experience
[10:30] <Fathefner> oo
[10:30] <Huffalump> fathefner, apparently they are not NTFS in any event.
[10:30] <jrib> xtknight: if you happen to use zsh, you can use *(D), otherwise you need to do list * and .*
[10:30] <xtknight> mfyz, uuidgen
[10:30] <jcreedy2> Okay, so the problem is, I get to the boot screen with the Ubuntu CD, but after I select any option, it takes a long time to load, and then stops outputting to my monitor whatsoever. I'm using an ATI Radeon X700 Sapphire. Any ideas?
[10:30] <Fathefner> i still have one pluged in
[10:30] <hossy> shane634: gah, i installed ndiswrapper with the correct driver and what not, no dice, it isn't recognizing any wireless ap's
[10:30] <Mr_Bunny_> how can I search my filesystem for a file from command line?
[10:30] <mfyz> hmm ok :)
[10:30] <xtknight> mfyz, if you want UUIDs for a harddisk, use "blkid".  uuidgen makes random ones
[10:30] <Jordan_U> Nrbelex, If you havn't messed with anything else ( like trying and failing to use NDIS wrapper ) just install bcm43xx-fwcutter
[10:30] <kerik> nobody ever tried to get an error message upon updating?
[10:30] <Fathefner> wow
[10:30] <LjL> mfyz: why "generate" them? they're automated calculated by an appropriate algorithm, keep the ones that were generated for you
[10:30] <LjL> !uuid > mfyz    (mfyz, see the private message from Ubotu)
[10:30] <Fathefner> i have them pluged it
[10:31] <nickv111> Holy crap that's a lot of people here.
[10:31] <pimpnasty> so is there a command to make it go in window mode?
[10:31] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, I haven't messed with anything - is that the name of the package?
[10:31] <Fathefner> it talks about a 60gb
[10:31] <xtknight> i've found ls /dev/disk/by-uuid to be more verbose
[10:31] <stefg> !uuid > stefg
[10:31] <xtknight> than blkid
[10:31] <Mr_Bunny_> pimpnasty: startx
[10:31] <cedricshock> LjL: Yeah, that's the quoted number. With 224 it thrashes the CD loading nautilus, and never advances (never being more than a couple hours).
[10:31] <slackern> jcreedy2: you could try using the alternate installation disc, that will not have a graphical installation though but may work better.
[10:31] <Jordan_U> Nrbelex, Yes
[10:31] <Huffalump> nickuzzy, well, I'm no expert on this topic.  I responded because I had some difficulties myself along those lines, but I learned that different people had different causes.  Hence... the desire to know more.
[10:31] <LjL> Mr_Bunny_:  find / | grep keyword , or  locate filename  but only if the file's been there for the last day at least
[10:31] <pimpnasty> startx ?
[10:31] <peter77> how/where do I enable mipmapping in beryl?
[10:31] <jrib> pimpnasty: why not ask transgaming?
[10:31] <xtknight> pimpnasty, window mode/ what do you mean?
[10:31] <xtknight> pimpnasty, oh 'windowed mode'.
[10:31] <Jordan_U> peter77, #beryl
[10:31] <xtknight> i'm not sure
[10:31] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, thanks - I'm giving it a try - why does this need to be done... why isn't it automatic?
[10:31] <pimpnasty> like I have cedaga
[10:31] <tom__> LjL, I did what you said and I got this: tom@tom-laptop:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh
[10:31] <tom__> xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration

[10:31] <pimpnasty> and trrying to my my game in windowed mode
[10:32] <LjL> cedricshock: are you sure it's not a problem of corrupted CD (or picky drive) rather than RAM? i'm not just quoting official figures, i *have* run the (edgy) CD on 192 megs
[10:32] <pimpnasty> so I can switch desktops
[10:32] <nuOpus> nrbelex its not done automatically in Windows either. LOL
[10:32] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: it have a 60gb a 40gb and a 200gb
[10:32] <nuOpus> windows has no support for our cards
[10:32] <nickv111> Guys, are there mirrors out there of the Ubuntu repository?
[10:32] <tom__> LjL, it didn't change my screen resolution I selected nVidia and 1650 by 1050
[10:32] <xtknight> jrib, ah so something like "zsh cp ./*(D) ./old_docs"  ??
[10:32] <peter77> Thanx Jordan_U
[10:32] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: it have a 60gb a 40gb and a 200gb the 40gb has ubuntu on it
=== jcreedy2 is now known as Xyon
[10:32] <nuOpus> its just done automatically by dell
[10:32] <nickv111> I need to install stuff but the servers are too loaded.
[10:32] <Huffalump> fathefner, so which one is a drive you'd like to try?  the 60gb first or a different one?
=== Xyon is now known as Zyon
[10:32] <Enselic_> How do I update the hostname after I have edited /etc/hostname?
[10:32] <slackern> jcreedy2: I know it worked fine with my X1950Pro AGP card oddly enough
[10:32] <PriceChild> !hostname > Enselic_ (see pm from ubotu)
[10:32] <Valstorm2379> Any idea how I can execute  a win file  so that it extracts to my floppy drive??
[10:32] <nickv111> Enselic_: Run "hostname"
[10:32] <mfyz> xtknight: because, i changed in fstab and grub`s menu.lst and now kernel not booting. i want to change it back again :) dpkg-reconfigure not worked..
[10:32] <LjL> tom__: that's fine, it means that it has made a backup for you (called /etc/X11/xorg.conf.20070420163052). if you also had made a backup yourself, you're twice as safe ;)
=== Zyon is now known as Xyon
[10:32] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: 60gb
[10:32] <xtknight> mfyz, oh then you dont want uuidgen obviously, that is a random uuid generator
[10:32] <LjL> tom__: of course, you also restarted X?
[10:32] <compengi> !restricted
[10:32] <pimpnasty> is there a command to make somthing in window mod?

[10:32] <adam_> do we still have to do a text file for wpa in fiesty?
[10:33] <xtknight> mfyz, use "blkid" as mentioned.
[10:33] <jrib> Enselic_: pay very close attention to what ubotu just told you
[10:33] <Jordan_U> Nrbelex, Basically, there are reverse engeneered open source *drivers* which are there by default, but the firmeare ( the code that runs on the card itself ) is proprietary and cannot be legally included by default
[10:33] <cedricshock> LjL: Already checked the CD, and the drive is one of the few things in that computer that isn't a pos. Maybe feisty jumped the memory usage.
[10:33] <pimpnasty> is there a command to make somthing in window mod?
[10:33] <pimpnasty> mode
[10:33] <Narf__> um

[10:33] <Narf__> how can I load this thing?
[10:33] <Huffalump> fathefner, okay, but keep in mind that linux is saying that drive is not NTFS.  however, sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows_C
[10:33] <tom__> LjL, ehh i don't think so
[10:33] <Xyon> I haven't been able to get ANY distro of linux working on my computer, liveCD or otherwise
[10:33] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, I see, thanks!
[10:33] <Narf__> whoops, sorry - didn't think about pasting
[10:34] <xtknight> Xyon, what kind of platform are you running?
[10:34] <LjL> tom__: well, hardly anything is going to change unless you restart it. ctrl+alt+backspace, and if it doesn't start, do what i said you should do in case of a problem.
[10:34] <Xyon> what do you mean by "platform"
[10:34] <dregin> hey, can anyone help me with an xorg.conf/nvidia problem? upgraded to feisty earlier today and x cant start giving me an error saying "no screens found"...
[10:34] <xtknight> Xyon, motherboard, CPU, architecture (i'm assuming x86)
[10:34] <Xyon> I am running an AMD64 3700+
[10:34] <lmosher> How does one identify what Ubuntu version they have?
[10:34] <xtknight> lmosher, lsb_release -a
[10:34] <Jordan_U> Xyon, What happens when you try to boot a liveCD?
[10:34] <Xyon> mobo is nvidia nForce
[10:34] <xtknight>  and 'uname -a' for kernel version
[10:34] <what_if> dregin: try rmmod nvidia, then starting X
[10:34] <xtknight> Xyon, nforce what?
[10:34] <Xyon> it crashes or displays nothing
[10:34] <Xyon> hold on, lemme think about it
[10:34] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, is there any need for a restart? I'm not seeing anything new in the Network Monitor
[10:34] <Xyon> been a whiel
[10:35] <dregin> what_if: kk, thanks.
[10:35] <stefg> Hmmm... !uuid is a very interesting factoid. Now i know where all the misbehaving in my system with stock-ubuntu-kernels come from. We re all guinea-pigs for libata-pata. Nice that I'm being told :-)
[10:35] <nickv111> !repository > nickv111
[10:35] <lmosher> Ok, so I'm on 6.10, what's the most recomended way to upgrade to fiesty?
[10:35] <xtknight> Xyon, ah well google "PC Wizard" if you cant remember.  i'd like to know the model # of your motherboard, ideally.
=== ejoy is now known as eternaljoy
[10:35] <Narf__> so, how can I load that 'MD subsystem' ?
[10:35] <Jordan_U> Nrbelex, You can either restart or run: sudo modprobe bcm43xx
[10:35] <Dumahen> how can i reach the shared files on network by consol ?
[10:35] <dregin> what_if: module nvidia does not exist in /proc/modules

[10:35] <Xyon> I'm using an ATI Radeon X700 Sapphire, by the way
[10:35] <xtknight> !upgrade | lmosher, use update-manager as described in the following
[10:35] <adam_> if anyone has the time, i have a wpa question about fiesty
[10:35] <ubotu> lmosher, use update-manager as described in the following: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[10:35] <nuOpus> rmmod ndiswrapper
[10:35] <pleed> hi! really need help! tried to upgrade on feisty but failed. now there re a lot of malfunctions... how can i reconfigure whole ubuntu?
[10:35] <nuOpus> whoops sorry
[10:35] <Dumahen> how can i reach the shared files on network by consol ?
[10:35] <cedricshock> LjL: I'm sure it'd run with some swap space, but that's not an option. Hmm, I might need to tryu some other live CD for the data recovery part of this. I tried knoppix, but it didn't like my firewire drive (ubuntu likes it just fine).
[10:35] <what_if> dregin: that could be the problem, did you use the ones from nVidia webpage or in apt ?
[10:36] <xtknight> pleed, if you /really/ /really/ /really/ want to, `sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a`
[10:36] <Jordan_U> !ask | adam
[10:36] <ubotu> adam: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[10:36] <xtknight> pleed, i just dont recommend it, that's all
[10:36] <lmosher> jrib, lol thanks... I was checking that as I asked, should have checked first. Thanks, and thanks xtknight also..
[10:36] <blazemonger> the live cd detected my ide pata drives as scsi devices
[10:36] <pleed> why not xtknight?
[10:36] <adam_> lol, i asked it and didnt see an answer so i asked if i could ask it to get attention, lol
[10:36] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, Brilliant, it worked! What did the last command I just did do? - THANKS!
[10:36] <cedricshock> pleed: How did it fail?
[10:36] <phobiac> I need to set all the files and directories in one directory to be owned by one user, how can I do this?
[10:36] <CirroX> damn I love 7.04
[10:36] <stefg> blazemonger: see my comment above
[10:36] <xtknight> pleed, because it's probably more than you want to do for something that could be a simple problem.  and it might screw something up.
[10:36] <dregin> what_if: I actually did apt-get remove nvidia-glx already...
[10:36] <CirroX> it's very good
[10:36] <adam_> do we still need to do a text file for wired wpa in fiesty
[10:36] <jrib> phobiac: what directory?
[10:36] <phobiac> I'm trying to make sense of chmod but it's confusing
[10:36] <annihilus> anyone have a solution to XServer not starting (No Screens Found), Im running at radeon x1300
[10:36] <pleed> dont know cause there was no exactly error message
[10:36] <LjL> cedricshock: there are live CDs around that are made specifically for data recovery purposes... not that i have names in my mind right now but
[10:36] <xtknight> phobiac, what confuses you about it?
[10:37] <xtknight> phobiac, the manual page can be frustratingly awful
[10:37] <dregin> what_if: Should I be using the apt drivers or the proprietary ones?
[10:37] <Jordan_U> Nrbelex, It loaded the driver again, which now works because the firmware is available
[10:37] <cedricshock> blazemongeR: Are they on a usb pata controller like jMicron?
[10:37] <blazemonger> i didnt see a comment
[10:37] <xtknight> jmicron isnt USB afaik
[10:37] <phobiac> jrib: A folder in /var/www, setting up ampache
[10:37] <pleed> xtknight, well when i try to start gnome-terminal it says "file not found" for example...
[10:37] <Nrbelex> Jordan_U, awesome - thanks again

[10:37] <pleed> xtknight, dont think thats a little bug...
[10:37] <Xyon> thats what i thought
[10:37] <blazemonger> not usb
[10:37] <Xyon> i think its my gfx card

[10:40] <Enselic_> kane77: when there are major releases it might take longer
[10:40] <tom_> LjL, i don't think so, it was like restart X server... you asked me if i had done it yet, and I hadnt so i typed it into the terminal and bang it started looking for settings or something but it didn't do anything so I eventually ctrl alt delted to restart
[10:40] <Shauny> anybody an "expert" IN pam?
=== jbardin_ is now known as jbardin
[10:40] <Jordan_U> Xyon, It just tends to work when the LiveCD doesn't
[10:40] <eck> kane77: packages are upgraded to new versions only when there is a new version -- within a version there are just security fixes and major bugs
[10:40] <Xyon> once i select start or install ubuntu, how long does it typically take for something to show up?
[10:40] <Wiseguy> hey guys, does anyone know why i wouldnt be able to access the windows share i have on my network? for some reason it says the contents cannot be displayed, possibly because the contents have been deleted. (although i know they havent)  anyone have any ideas?
[10:40] <LjL> tom_: well, i had told you to hit ctrl+alt+backspace. if that wasn't what you did, then it could hardly work correctly. anyway, are you sure that now - even though the resolution is the same - you cannot go to System / Preferences / Display (or what it's called) and select a higher one?
[10:40] <eck> kane77: thunderbird 2 will most likely _not_ appear in feisty
[10:40] <blazemonger> my friend who used to be a windows nazi now likes linux cuz of ubuntu
[10:40] <AATDark> Xyon: not very long
[10:40] <ScrAm> I just downloaded and installed Ubuntu 7.04 yesterday from my Ubuntu 6.10, and now pretty much everything I start freezes.
[10:40] <Xyon> hmmm
[10:40] <blazemonger> im gonna show him 7.04
[10:40] <ScrAm> Firefox, xmms
[10:40] <kane77> eck, why not? :(
[10:40] <AATDark> Xyon: if you doesn't see anything something is wron
[10:41] <Huffalump> fathefner, I'm going to be stepping away, so... listen, ntfs-3g works great.  I've used it on regular hard drives inside the box, but if you've got USB drives then I did just search around and found this killer tutorial -> http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_edgy_eft_ntfs_ntfs_3g that'll work in Feisty as well
[10:41] <Xyon> well i went to graphics-safe install and it took about 5 mins for it to load
[10:41] <Blubloblu> Hi there, does anyone want to help me?
[10:41] <Xyon> and then it just crashed
[10:41] <Sgeo> Where can I download a 6.10 alt. install disk?
[10:41] <AATDark> Xyon: how long are you already waiting ?
[10:41] <Xyon> i waited with a blank screen for about 5 mins
[10:41] <stefg> !download
[10:41] <ubotu> Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive
[10:41] <Xyon> then i just restarted back to windows
[10:41] <eck> kane77: because feisty is stable, introducing major software revisions and new features would not be stable
[10:41] <Huffalump> fathefner, stick with ntfs-3g.  why only read when you can write?  it rocks.
[10:41] <tom_> LjL, yeah i checked i am still stuck at 1024 by 768
[10:41] <AATDark> Xyon: do you have an ATI card?
[10:41] <Xyon> yes
[10:41] <Shauny> help im getting error: pam_start() failed, error 26
[10:41] <Xyon> i believe that's the source of the problem
[10:41] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: ok will do i have to walk away too
[10:41] <blazemonger> the ONLY thing i dont like about fiesty is the proprietary drivers
[10:41] <Sgeo> n/m I think
[10:41] <Xyon> what can i do to fix that?
[10:42] <Fathefner> Huffalump2: thank u
=== Stillness is now known as Unforeseen
[10:42] <Jordan_U> Xyon, You can install the proprietary ati drivers ( fglrx )
[10:42] <LjL> tom_: what did you select when you were asked about your monitor's capabilities? (there were three choices, "Simple", "Medium" and "Advanced", i usually choose "Medium", since it allows me to just select the resolution i want at the desired refresh rate)
[10:42] <Xyon> okay, how do i do that before i even start ubuntu?
[10:42] <AATDark> Xyon: but will be diffucalt if you cant boot :D
[10:42] <legolaswood> Am i correct that we can download a small package named Kubuntu desktop to add KDE to ubuntu?
[10:42] <pimpnasty> how can I alt tab in linux?
[10:42] <Xyon> yah
[10:42] <Xyon> lolo
[10:42] <blazemonger> btw i have a rage 128 pro...the desktop efffects dont run
[10:42] <cables> pimpnasty, by hitting alt tab.
[10:42] <ammiel> Is there a way I can make ubuntu go back to the old style of mounting (so the drive always mounts on /media/cdrom0 or /media/cdrom1 and not something such as /mnt/STARCRAFT)
[10:42] <kerik> hey there
[10:42] <LjL> legolaswood: it's not a "small package"... but yes
[10:42] <cables> pimpnasty, it should just work.
[10:42] <LjL> !kubuntu > legolaswood    (legolaswood, see the private message from Ubotu)
[10:42] <pimpnasty> well I cant alt tab in this game
[10:42] <Xyon> considering just giving up, all i wanted to do was try out compiz and xgl stuff
[10:42] <xtknight> ammiel, put it in fstab
[10:42] <Jordan_U> Xyon, Install with the alternate install CD, no GUI == no problem installing :)
[10:43] <ubuntuserverguy> could someone tell me a text editor in ubuntu server?
[10:43] <pimpnasty> im trying to play windowed mode
[10:43] <kerik> anybody who can explain the reason for this? Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy-security/main/source/Sources.bz2 Underprocessen bzip2 returnerede en fejlkode (2)
[10:43] <kane77> eck, and isnt there any "bleeding" edge repo that would contain the newest packages?
[10:43] <blazemonger> other than that things seem to be going good so far during the install
[10:43] <eck> pimpnasty: you probably have to use the left alt
[10:43] <cables> Can anyone tell me how I can subscribe to podcasts in Amarok?
[10:43] <pimpnasty> is there a command for windowed mod?
[10:43] <cedricshock> LjL: If I boot the alternate install CD, can I get a nice fluffy console?
[10:43] <cables> ubuntuserverguy, nano
[10:43] <ubuntuserverguy> thanks
[10:43] <Xyon> i'm guessing altCD is also 700mb?
[10:43] <ubuntuserverguy> :)
[10:43] <xtknight> putting it in fstab disables gnome-hal-mounter for that block device, does it not?
[10:43] <xtknight> Xyon, yes
[10:43] <LjL> cedricshock: console, yes, nice and fluffy, i wouldn't say so - most commands are missing
[10:43] <Xyon> cuz.... i'm on a capped network here
[10:43] <Shauny> eck, do you know what it means by: pam_start() failed, error 26
[10:43] <tom_> LjL, it asked me what out of a list of things did i think my video card was ... i picked nvidia... most of the other ones seemed like random letters
[10:43] <Shaddox> Where can I download the DVD release of ubuntu feisty? Noone's seeding the torrent...X_x
[10:43] <xtknight> dont you get busybox
[10:43] <eck> kane77: when gutsy (the next release) is in the repos that would be the bleeding edge release
[10:43] <AATDark> Xyon: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2475130
[10:43] <LjL> cedricshock: you can always boot the *live* cd in single user console mode, though! can't you?
[10:43] <Xyon> gonna blow my limit out of the water with 1400mb in a day
[10:43] <ammiel> xtknight, it will automatically mount as /mnt/*cd name* my fstab does say to mount it as /media/cdrom*
[10:44] <Xyon> ~[ AATDark ] ~ thank you sir
[10:44] <eck> Shauny: what gave you that error message?
[10:44] <cedricshock> LjL: How do I do that?
[10:44] <xtknight> ammiel, is the fstab set to "auto"
[10:44] <AATDark> Xyon: do you have DVI ?
[10:44] <jrib> ramy: please ask that in #ubuntu-offtopic, not here.  Thanks
[10:44] <xtknight> ammiel, the entry (what are the options?  e.g. "user" disables "auto" by default but usually "auto" is by default on unless "noauto" or "user" is specified)
[10:44] <LjL> tom_: most of the other things *are* quite useless (meaning you can just press Enter). but do it again and be careful to choose "Medium" when it asks you about your monitor sync ranges, and there select the target resolution at a refresh rate that you know your monitor can handle
[10:44] <Shauny> eck, im following a tutorial, url http://www.spencerstirling.com/computergeek/mysqluser.html, and im using the passwd function
[10:45] <kane77> eck, I mean _on_ feisty, but latest packages?
[10:45] <SnakePlisken> better is an opinion
[10:45] <blazemonger>  Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
[10:45] <LjL> cedricshock: i think you can probably just add "single" to the kernel options, though it's not like i've tried
[10:45] <nowisn> is it easier to install ubunu or windows first on a single drive??
[10:45] <LjL> !bootoptions > cedricshock    (cedricshock, see the private message from Ubotu)
[10:45] <eck> kane77: no, you would need to compile it or instlal it yourself
[10:45] <LjL> nowisn: windows
[10:45] <ammiel> xtknight, not really, it has auto and noauto in it
[10:45] <Jordan_U> Xyon, When you are at that black screen does ctrl+alt+F1-6 do anything?
[10:45] <xtknight> ammiel, eh remove noauto
[10:45] <kane77> :/
[10:45] <xtknight> ammiel, then try it.  if that doesnt work im not sure :\
[10:45] <ammiel> xtknight, ok thanks

[10:46] <ubotu> The Ubuntu repositories and ISO mirrors are currently under heavy load due to the release of !Feisty. Please consider using !torrents to download ISO images, and be patient with APT updates.

[10:46] <nuOpus> ok. I got my broadcom working with the bcm43xx modules
[10:46] <dregin> am I better of with glx or proprietary nvidia drivers in feisty??

[10:46] <nuOpus> lol
[10:46] <Terrasque> is there a standard ubuntu channel that is not a support channel?

[10:48] <Blubloblu> superblocks corrupted or something
[10:48] <LjL> cedricshock, it doesn't mention that option specifically but it tells you how to enter the boot options editor (f6 whatever). just try adding "single" there. not sure it will work - it works on installations, but the live cd is different - but worth trying i suppose
[10:48] <ramy> why ubunto website show that the older 6.06 is supported till 2009 while the newer 7.04 is supported till 2008 only !

[10:53] <vietnames> somebody help me about typing
[10:54] <TashKavarish> ddcprobe lists the resolution but it still wont work
[10:54] <muyi> u can ge byrel through atumatix
[10:54] <LjL> tom_: you still selected nvidia (not nv) as before, didn't you?
[10:54] <LjL> !blacklist > nuOpus    (nuOpus, see the private message from Ubotu)
[10:54] <bofh80> LjL,  i have copied the info, it is something for me to go on :D
[10:54] <vietnames> i cannot typy dot (.) in firefox
[10:54] <kerik> PriceChild: but actually right now it is downloading pretty heavily..maybe it will work next time..thanx anyways :)
[10:54] <tom_> LjL, yeah
[10:54] <Terrasque> zilly6_: maybe take a look at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/apt-torrent
[10:54] <AATDark> vietnames: only in firefox ?
[10:54] <tom_> LjL, did i fuck that up?
[10:54] <vietnames> i must type dot (.) in numpa
[10:54] <cedricshock> nuOpus: you can blacklist kernel modules. Never done it myself, but that's the word to look for.
[10:54] <Notchnick> Jordan_U I just tried to open desktop-effects and it asked to enable Nvidia .. then I restarted and now ubuntu is not working
[10:54] <vietnames> how to fix it
[10:54] <dooglus> is it worth updating to feisty?  or hasn't much changed since dapper?
[10:54] <eck> Blubloblu: in your /etc/fstab you specify the devices by uuid rather than device name
[10:55] <apoth> Hey everyone
[10:55] <AATDark> vietnames: on my numpad there is no dot (just a ,)
[10:55] <zbrown> dooglus: since dapper? a lot has changed
[10:55] <arthur_kalm> hi everyone, I installed 7.04 an hour or so and when I try to use the nvidia-glx-new drivers, I'm unable to launch X because "Failed to load module "wfb" (module does not exist, 0)"
[10:55] <foug> my gaim has stopped blinking when i receive new messages. I didn't change any settings anywhere, anyone know why
[10:55] <dooglus> zbrown: for the better?
[10:55] <Shauny> eck do the spaces between account and sufficient have to be tab spaces?
[10:55] <AATDark> vietnames: probalby german layout
[10:55] <LjL> tom_: no, you were supposed to do that. not sure, let me see your xorg.conf please (type  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf  and paste it all into the pastebin)
[10:55] <apoth> I've been having some weird problem with Fiesty on a Macbook.
[10:55] <nuOpus> thank you!
[10:55] <vietnames> n
[10:55] <slackern> Notchnick: You could reboot into failsafe mode, and run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and choose the vesa driver there and it will give you the standard driver again, after that you could try to install the 3 different nvidia drivers manually, they are named nvidia-glx-legacy, nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-new and the order i wrote them in match old newer newest driver versions
[10:55] <Jordan_U> Notchnick, How far is it getting when you boot? do you see anything at all?
[10:55] <zbrown> dooglus: Yes. Edgy and Dapper gave me problems on my laptop, there's none with Feisty.
[10:55] <eck> Blubloblu: this is mine for an example, but i am mixing UUIDs, labels, and device names so it is kind of a mess http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16650/
[10:55] <cedricshock> nuOpus: And now that you mention it that sounds like one of the nicest things to turn off. I've pulled the speaker cable inside computers before...
[10:55] <vietnames> i use vietnamese languag

[10:55] <LjL> tom_: you can always restore the backup anyway, to at least get back to the initial state
[10:55] <tsp> ok... my network card is being a patrinfikulo under feisty, at least in the livecd. Corrupted packet and such. Any tips?
[10:55] <temujoe> Is there a specific place I can check to see what video card my box is using, through the terminal?
[10:55] <arthur_kalm> just now I installed the nvidia drivers off of the nvidia website and now it's telling me that the kernel and X modules don't match...
[10:55] <bofh80> REPAST: anybody know of some kind of Hash / CRC / MD5 database? that will cataolgue my entire harddrives and my other computers to find mismatch / duplicate files on my machines and various folders? < leaving pc for moment, if anyone has any suggestions, PM them to me please (i have asked this question repeatly for weeks :P )
[10:55] <nuOpus> cedricshock: well im on a laptop, and im sick of it beeping at work! lol
[10:55] <tom_> LjL, whats pastebin?
[10:56] <adam_> do we still need to do a text file for wired wpa in fiesty or will network manager do it?
[10:56] <vietnames> i think there error with languae  vietnames
[10:56] <LjL> !pastebin > tom_    (tom_, see the private message from Ubotu)
[10:56] <zbrown> nuOpus: you can also just disable your system console beep lol
[10:56] <andres__> #ubuntu-es
[10:56] <arthur_kalm> but it never complained when I had nvidia-glx-new installed...
[10:56] <zbrown> nuOpus:  :)
[10:56] <arthur_kalm> wtf?
[10:56] <eck> Shauny: afaik spaces vs. tabs does not matter
[10:56] <variant> adam_: wired wpa??
[10:56] <[uplink] > wow
[10:56] <Shauny> !pastebin > tom
[10:56] <Notchnick> Jordan_U I remember reading kernel and few lines loading.. then it halts with a black screen
[10:56] <Blubloblu> eck: where do i find the UUID of my devices?
[10:56] <apoth> Since I made the move to 2.6.15, I've been having this weird problem where the touchpad and keyboard start lagging whenever I start using a wired network
[10:56] <vietnames> ex: www.tuoitre.com.vn ---> tuoitrcom.vn
[10:56] <nuOpus> zbrown: disable shminable!!! lol
[10:56] <Jump86> i need help w/ feisty and beryl.. everything works after my upgrade other than beryl.. its nothing but a white screen.. it worked fine in edgy before.. using the same config.. NVIDIA card, release version, tried uninstall/reinstall already
[10:56] <[uplink] > hmmm
[10:56] <vietnames> how to fix it
[10:56] <eck> bofh80: i think you can use rsync and have it just tell you which files it would change, and not update them
[10:56] <NemesisD> aanyone? whats your favorite text editor for scripting?
[10:57] <tsp> heh, /msg w/ the naswer please, my screen reader's going nuts
[10:57] <eck> Blubloblu: use the blkid command
[10:57] <apoth> Anyone have any idea?
[10:57] <adam_> variant: my school has wpa through our wired network, to get it working in dapper and edgy we needed to create a text file to do the wpa
[10:57] <arthur_kalm> ok perhaps someone can direct me to a less fast past chat :P, where is the ubuntu support for display drivers channel?
[10:57] <hyapadi> hi, i'm using 7.04 on mobile laptop. how to set the cpu into dynamic mode? thanks
[10:57] <Notchnick> slackern thanks will try that
[10:57] <Xyon> Fastest Mirror site for someone in Illinois?
[10:57] <kzm> hey hallo.. i just upgraded to feisty but my xserver wont load the nvidia-glx anymore and thus crashes.... does anybody experienced the same and found a solution?
[10:57] <temujoe> AATDark: Do you be any chance know how to check what video card is running through the command line?
[10:57] <vietnames> i use ubuntu 6.06
[10:57] <slackern> Notchnick: It will atleast bring you a working enviroment again that you can work from
[10:57] <zbrown> nuOpus: if you edit /etc/inputrc and uncomment system bell disable it does it too
[10:57] <zbrown> :)
[10:57] <tapo> I try to upgrade from 6.10 to 7.04 with system update. it gives man an error "I need more spave on harddisk... it wants 13MB on /boot" but there's 28MB free on /boot...
[10:57] <eck> hyapadi: i believe it is done by default now
[10:57] <Jimbo99> anyone know if enemy-territory will run under feisty fawn amd64?
[10:57] <arthur_kalm> hyapadi: I think you have to install powernowd. But I think that it should be doing this automatically...
[10:58] <Jordan_U> arthur_kalm, For slower chat ( I think ) the place to go is #ubuntu-classroom
[10:58] <cedricshock> bofh80: I understand what you want, and I don't know of anything. It'd be a very simple program...
[10:58] <eck> hyapadi: if you use the gnome cpu frequency applet you can check
[10:58] <apoth> Why would it do something like that? Even right now... it's doing this weirf thing where if I push "a," there's a 30% chance it'll show up as "aaaaa"
[10:58] <tom_> LjL,  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16651/
[10:58] <arthur_kalm> Jordan_U: thank you

[10:59] <Shauny> eck, sorry i meant handlers
[10:59] <AATDark> [uplink] : ubuntu cd in your CD Drive => reboot pc
[10:59] <eck> hyapadi: make sure powernowd (or whatever governor you are using) is running
[10:59] <cedricshock> foug: the  Drive Usage tool is under accessories in feisty. If you want usage fro single drives it's omsewhere in the system menus.

[11:00] <legolaswood> can some one please tell me how does ubuntu compare with openSuse 10.2 in term of up-to-date packages and stability?
[11:00] <LjL> tom_: err, man, you did *not* select your resolution. there's just 1024x768 (and lower ones) there. you need to select the one you want in *both* the monitor sync ranges part, *and* the resolution part itself.
[11:00] <AATDark> LaszloKv: a easy config ? ore something unbearable hard?
[11:00] <slackern> Notchnick: then you should have the nvidia-glx-new otherwise you won't have a driver installed that supports it
[11:00] <vietnames> hello all
[11:00] <n00tz> legolaswood: on par
[11:00] <kzm> davmor2 i just upgraded to feisty from edgy now my xeserver wont start because the nvidia-glx module wont get load
[11:00] <vietnames> help me pls
[11:00] <cedricshock> LaszloKv: Most likely (not me thought). Fire away.
[11:00] <apoth> I guess no one has that problem?
[11:00] <tom_> LjL, I swear I did... i picked the same thing twice
[11:00] <LaszloKv> AATDark, umm, I'm not sure yet.
[11:00] <tom_> LjL, can I just manually add the resolution i want to that file?
[11:00] <fuzzy_logic> hello world!
[11:00] <LjL> tom_: yes, you can do that.
[11:01] <legolaswood> does it has latest 3d desktop?
[11:01] <AATDark> LaszloKv: what do you need ? a Domain Controler ?
[11:01] <WannabeNewbie> Quick question, where can I find out how to change the repositories that Synaptic Manager pulls from?
[11:01] <vietnames> attdark: can i private chat with U ?
[11:01] <LaszloKv> AATDark, I just want to share a folder.
[11:01] <cotton> What does 7.04 have that 6.10 doesn't?
[11:01] <slackern> WannabeNewbie: /etc/apt/sources.list
[11:01] <AATDark> LaszloKv: then it is easy
[11:01] <eck> vietnames: just ask your question to the channel
[11:01] <WannabeNewbie> slackern: Online I mean
[11:01] <vietnames> ok
[11:01] <AATDark> LaszloKv: think it works nearly with defaut config ..
[11:02] <Ashex> !broadcom
[11:02] <ubotu> Wireless documentation can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs
[11:02] <slackern> WannabeNewbie: that file specifies which which online place you get the files from.
[11:02] <Notchnick> slackern so I install 3 drivers or just the last one?
[11:02] <theblakeus> join #ubuntu-classroom
[11:02] <fuzzy_logic> i try to install envy unstable on feisty (cuz thats the only one that supports feisty).. but i get the following message: Bad luck, the kernel headers for the target kernel version could not be found and you did not specify other valid kernel headers to use. what should i do?
[11:02] <vietnames> i want to type www.tuoitre.com.vn but the result is www.tuoitrcom.vn
[11:02] <Littlebob> if i have a floppy with linux with ubuntu installer on the hard drive would intiating the installation work?
[11:02] <WannabeNewbie> slackern: Ok then thanks
[11:02] <LaszloKv> AATDark, I've been trying all different set ups in the samba conf file, but I can never get it to actually share
[11:02] <slackern> Notchnick: you only need the nvidia-glx-new, not the nvidia-glx-legacy or nvidia-glx
[11:02] <vietnames> or type U? -> 
[11:02] <WannabeNewbie> Will that also show me how to activate the universe and multi-verse options?
[11:03] <AATDark> LaszloKv: what is the problem ? can you connect ?
[11:03] <eck> vietnames: you probably need to change your keyboard, try system > preferences > keyboard
[11:03] <tom_> k ctrl alt brb
[11:03] <Notchnick> slackern ok
[11:03] <slackern> Notchnick: you should be able to do a apt-get remove nvidia-glx at the rescue terminal
[11:03] <vietnames> i tr
[11:03] <vietnames> i try
[11:03] <slackern> Notchnick: and then do a apt-get install nvidia-glx-new to get the new one
[11:03] <AATDark> AATDark: or can't you start the samba service?
[11:03] <slackern> Notchnick: and reboot after that to see if it works, it it doesnt you can use dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[11:03] <LaszloKv> AATDark, well earlier I had one computer that would be asked for the password, but then get permission denied, and now the other computer I am working with isn't connecting at all.
[11:03] <braveheartlion> Hello, friends. I'm running the distribution upgrade and I'm now faced with the "configuring mdadm" screen.  Pls see http://p.rc6.org/index.php?id=a9691b6ae7.should I choose "all" available arrays (which is the default answer, by the way)?
[11:04] <davmor2> kzm: no problems drop into safe mode and change nvidia to nv in /etc/X11/xorg.conf using nano.  once you change it just hit ctrl-x to exit and save.  reboot now you have a working system.  go onto restricted drivers and install nvidia via that method.  Hope it helps
[11:04] <eck> vietnames: if you go to add layout, you can add non-english keyboard layouts
[11:04] <kzm> slackern: are you talking about nvidia problems with feisty?
[11:04] <AATDark> LaszloKv: can you post your samba config at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
[11:04] <vietnames> ok let me try
[11:04] <slackern> kzm: Yes
[11:04] <braveheartlion> http://p.rc6.org/index.php?id=a9691b6ae7 is the link

[11:05] <vietnames> i cannot see non english
[11:05] <rx> help
[11:05] <slackern> kzm: im not sure, but he has a 8800 card which didnt work, so i assume the restricted manager installs the nvidia-glx package, and he probably needs the nvidia-glx-new which has newer drivers
[11:05] <rx> hello
[11:05] <cedricshock> rx: ?
[11:05] <groo> hi i am trying to get this Netgear WAG511 wifi card to work with 7.04, several people say that it is plug an play but i put it in and it does not recognize the card at all, what am i doing wrong?

[11:07] <Shadowpillar> actually forget it
[11:07] <jrib> shakya: what kind of trouble?
[11:07] <groo> is there a wifi config box somewhere?
[11:07] <arthur_kalm> I installed Fiesty an hour or so ago and I am unable to use the latest nVidia drivers. I attempted to install nvidia-glx-new and for some reason X fails to load saying:Failed to load module "wfb" (module does not exist, 0). I need the latest drivers since I'm using an 8800 GTS. I attempted to install the drivers from the nVidia site, and now the complaint is that my kernel and X module versions do not match...
[11:07] <arthur_kalm> it never complained when I used nvidia-glx-new (same version).... I'm not sure if I should remove nvidia-kernel-common since it asks to remove linux-generic, linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20-15-generic, linux-restricted-modules-generic, but I think that nvidia-kernel-common is confusing the latest nVidia driver. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I need my second monitor and 1280x1024 resolution :(
[11:07] <petr4> braveheartlion i guess. what are the oher options?
[11:07] <MrMakeveli> petr4, yeah thats ok, but i dont want to miss out on any packages...

[11:09] <AATDark> LaszloKv: can you type sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart ? or is there an error message ?

[11:13] <AATDark> LaszloKv: what did you enter in the windwos explorer ?
[11:13] <crzyboon> how do i play real media files on linux?

[11:13] <tom_> LjL,  i don't think 1280 by 1024 scales correct for 1600 x 1050 but eh
[11:14] <crzyboon> dcomsa, its supported now?
[11:14] <sonictwin> how do i tell XChat to load Firefox instead of Galeon?
[11:14] <Shadowpillar> another question, since inittab is no longer used, how does one edit how many gettys are in use?
[11:14] <davmor2> kzm:  that's probably what the problem is then
[11:14] <LaszloKv> AATDark, Neither works
[11:14] <shakya> here is the error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16656/
[11:14] <slackern> kzm: I was just reading a little about people installing a binary driver but doing it when they swapped out their 8800 card for another nvidia card and then switched back
[11:14] <astronouth7303> I'm trying to upgrade to Feisty, but it complains about not having 32.6MB free in /boot. How do I clean out /boot?
[11:14] <crzyboon> SnakePlisken, i know- i wonder why do idiots keep encoding using that codec.
[11:14] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: run alsamixer and unmute it using "m"
[11:14] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, its already unmuted
[11:14] <dcomsa> crzyboon: hmm don't realy know ... i tought it plays anything :)
[11:14] <eric> hello, i upgraded to feisty, now i can't boot.... it installed raid, but I don't have raid. I am at rescue prompt, how do I turn off raid/madm or whatever? :)
[11:14] <vietnames> THANKS ALL FOR HELPING M
[11:14] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, i unmuted everything and turned it all up
[11:14] <shakya> as you can see i tried various different java thingies
[11:14] <CirroX> burning my first CD on ubuntu :)
[11:14] <slackern> kzm: seems a bit farfetched though, since it can be installed in a rescue console anyhow
[11:14] <vietnames> i try latter
[11:14] <vietnames> thanks a lot
[11:15] <crzyboon> dcomsa, everything but real media, i think- better ask at #mplayer.
[11:15] <shakya> any ideas?
[11:15] <petr4> crzyboon ubuntu 7.04 should detect what packeges are needed to play media files
[11:15] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: using alsamixer?
[11:15] <vietnames> i use 6.06 now
[11:15] <kzm> davmor2: what does this mean? that its not recognizing my card? but i had it working perfect under edgy. i used envy though to install..
[11:15] <eric> hello, i upgraded to feisty, now i can't boot.... it installed raid, but I don't have raid. I am at rescue prompt, how do I turn off raid/madm or whatever? :)
[11:15] <vietnames> onc

[11:15] <CirroX> crzyboon: I noticed the VLC player worked better than totem!
[11:15] <vietnames> 1 question more
[11:15] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: Are samba masks (not modes) permisions you do have or permisions you don't?
[11:15] <AATDark> LaszloKv: ok try it from the windows cmd ..the command is net use * \\ip\music /user:root
[11:15] <slackern> kzm: Read this. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-restricted-modules-2.6.20/+bug/98641

[11:15] <vietnames> anyone user keepassX ?
[11:15] <shakya> any ideas jrib?
[11:15] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, using volume control (alsa mixer)
[11:15] <kzm> slackern: they swapped the card while installing a driver for it???

[11:16] <shakya> here is the error http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16656/
[11:16] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, i can do it in terminal if you think it'd help
[11:16] <davmor2> kzm: Personally I would go into synaptic and reinstall the nvidia-glx module and then try reinstalling the drivers by typing nvidia-glx-xconfig and see if that fixes the problem
[11:16] <eric> i booted w/ the live cd to try and fix... i'm at command prompt from live CD, able to mount my normal disk (hda2) as /media/disk
[11:16] <vietnames> can db file work ok in ubuntu ?
[11:16] <crzyboon> petr4, sure it does- but when it comes to real media's wrath, i don't think anything could keep up- yeh, vlc media plays almost any video file. but it too has probs- for instance, mplayer does a better job of rendering .subbed vids than vlc-
[11:16] <vietnames> anyone have experience ?
=== william is now known as bwahahaha
[11:16] <penguin42> eric: OK, so when you boot up from the hard disc how far does it get?
[11:16] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: nono, run alsamixer in a terminal. When you get it to work run "alsactl store" as root.
[11:16] <shakya> jrib, i am using the live cd boot option
[11:16] <jrib> shakya: you need to enable universe and multiverse

[11:17] <jrib> !multiverse > shakya    (shakya, see the private message from ubotu)
[11:17] <LjL> tom_: why 1280x1024? anyway 1600x1050 is admittedly not very standard, the one that's listed is 1400x1050
[11:17] <AATDark> LaszloKv: try sudo chmod -R 777 /media/BUSLINK/music
[11:17] <eric> it goes through md: raid messages, then hangs trying to find the root file system (can't find root file system).  there is no raid on this laptop, so not sure why it is loading raid "stuff" :)
[11:17] <LaszloKv> AATDark, the other computer says that the network path was not found.  I'll try from cmd now though.
[11:17] <shakya> how do i enable those?

[11:17] <eldragon> anyone here use the 'ati' drivers and can help? im trying to rid myself from the fglrx drivers...need dri working, is that possible?
[11:17] <bambie> thanks for the help guys.
[11:17] <vietnames> ok
[11:17] <LaszloKv> AATDark, I did chmod already, but I'll double check
[11:17] <tom_> LjL, scaled from that
[11:17] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: yep.
[11:17] <vietnames> bye all
[11:17] <cedricshock> AATDark: I meant something diferent, looking through his conf file.
[11:17] <petr4> eirc: you probably installed only radi support. if you did not edit parrtition (to create raid array), than the raid tools are inactive and its unlikely they could do problems

[11:18] <AATDark> LaszloKv: then run on server tail /var/log/samba/ .. it should display the log .
[11:18] <LjL> tom_, ok, but that's harder, it won't be just a matter of adding it to xorg.conf i'm afraid

[11:18] <makaraki> I have a really newby question does kernel 2.6.17-11-generic support dual core?
[11:18] <vietnames> thanks
[11:18] <AATDark> LaszloKv: there must be more information
[11:18] <eck> Shauny: unless you're really attached to the idea of doing SQL lookups, directory services like AD and LDAP are much more common for user information, and i think there are docs for it on the ubuntu wiki
[11:18] <ksyms> There is a feature in gnome that shows when you have new action in a window. Is it possible to disable for a specific software, ie gaim?
[11:18] <eric> i did an upgrade from edgy, i didn't do any raid editing
[11:18] <LjL> tom_: if you put a non-standard resolution there without a modeline, it's unlikely to work
[11:18] <penguin42> eric: Sure - but when you boot where does it get to before it fails?

[11:19] <LaszloKv> Yeah, on the computer I get better luck with the log says, "[2007/04/20 06:23:41, 0]  smbd/service.c:make_connection_snum(663)  '/media/BUSLINK/music' does not exist or permission denied when connecting to [music]  Error was Permission denied"

[11:19] <eck> Shauny: if you already use a SQL database for users and want to tie GDM into that then it would be ok, but if you are starting from scratch a directory service is probably better down the road
[11:19] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, k i'll try that too. but its not picking anything up at all :( lemme keep trying
[11:19] <AATDark> LaszloKv,<cedricshock: ok now we know that is is a permission problem
[11:19] <penguin42> eric: You can try deleting /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf  but depending where it is failing you probably need to regenerate the initrd as well
[11:19] <cedricshock> AATDark: the masks are allowable permissions, so he's got them right

[11:20] <eric> i have to boot w/ nosplash to get messages, it has messages about raid drivers loading (raid6 or raid10, then says it can't find the root filesystem (which, is specified w/ a GUID. if i specify root=/dev/hda1 or root=/dev/hda2 that doesn't work either)
[11:20] <petr4> eric: it happended to me when i upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 (sorry i do not know/refuse to know code names)
[11:20] <shakya> jrib how can i save changes to that file?
[11:20] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: did that mic ever work?
[11:20] <eldragon> eric, the module is dmraid, wouldnt know how to disable it....

[11:20] <jrib> shakya: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list     the wiki explains this
[11:20] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, The other computer doesn't even show up in the logs.
[11:20] <eric> can i blacklist dmraid module?
[11:20] <shakya> thank you

[11:21] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, yes, used it a few months ago before i switched to ubuntu. now has been the first time that i've needed to use it. so everything should be right (mic in the right lil spot and all that)
[11:21] <penguin42> eric: So if you specify it with root=/dev/blah what error do you get? Also what is your hard disc controller?
[11:21] <eldragon> eric, can you access the fstab file?

[11:21] <laurence_> Hi, all! I've just got a new Samsung LCD TV, with VGA port on the back, so I've hooked one of my Ubuntu (Edgy) boxes up to it. Problem is, if I try to run it at 1360x768 (the native resolution), the screen cuts in and out about once per second or few. If I edit xorg.conf to use 800x600, then it works fine, although stretched. 1024x768 does the same as 1360x. Has anyone got any clues how to fix that?

[11:23] <alexboy> I'm about to upgrade. but I want to back up enough to do a bare-metal restore back to the current state.  Having archived off all my media/large files I'm going to make a tar of my / partition (simple setup, just root and swap), if i make a backup of my mbr and partition table using (first 512 bytes), if I change the parition table will it restore my parition tale as-is despite the changes?
[11:23] <laurence_> It did the same at 1024x768 though, which I've had it doing on a monitor before.
[11:23] <MrMakeveli> i tried other progs w/ sound capture
[11:23] <davmor2> kzm: no it's nvidia-glx-xconfig
[11:23] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, *
[11:23] <eldragon> is it possible to get DRI with the ATI drivers (not fglrx, the open source ones)
[11:23] <zaphands> zaphands: Makes sure Alsa supports your hardware.
[11:23] <nir_ai> how do I boot ubuntu without starting the x server?
[11:23] <laurence_> I've got another box lying around with a Geforce 4 - is that more likely to work?
[11:23] <Wesley> mmm
[11:23] <eck> hmca: it probably conflicts with upstart
[11:23] <eric> hmmm it was hda1 yesterday, pre-upgrade
[11:23] <bambie>  guys one more question, how can i get my wireless network working?
[11:23] <kzm> slackern: awesome... whats this pastebin?
[11:23] <shakya> well, sun java 5.0 runtime is checked off (installed)... i cannot uncheck it (in order to recheck it) because applications depend on it
[11:24] <tom_> LjL, SUCESSS!!!! 1440 by 900 baby
[11:24] <bambie> i've ubuntu 6.06
[11:24] <Wesley> thats some premium grade shit
[11:24] <dcomsa> eldragon: try radeon driver
[11:24] <shakya> it is checked off but java is not installed
[11:24] <AATDark> LaszloKv: when does the error message (in the samba log appear)
[11:24] <bambie> and my wireless chip is Airlink
[11:24] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: make sure alsa supports yout hardware
[11:24] <cedricshock> LaszloKv: Are all the capitals, excetra right in /media/BUSLINK/music?
[11:24] <AATDark> LaszloKv: only when you connect or when you start samba ?
[11:24] <slackern> kzm: it's a site where you paste stuff, just visit the pastebin link here it comes again http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16659/
[11:24] <PovAddict> is the DVD installer live too, or is it like alternate CD?
[11:24] <nir_ai> how do I boot ubuntu without starting the x server (in console mode)?
[11:24] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, it probably doesnt... its a dynex 5.1 sound card
[11:24] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, I'm pretty sure it's when I try to connect.
[11:24] <tom_> LjL, Shit..... how come beryl isn't working now???
[11:24] <cedricshock> nir_ai: From CD or installed?
[11:24] <PriceChild> !ohmy
[11:24] <ubotu> Please watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
[11:24] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, I'll restart samba to see.
[11:25] <slackern> kzm: not 100% sure if it'll help, talking to another guy having a problem also with that solution
[11:25] <nir_ai> cedricshock: from installed
[11:25] <kzm> davmor2: yes.. i meant that.. i even copy and paste it from the synaptic manager info where it says to use the same command to enable the driver
[11:25] <dcomsa> nir_ai: add single to your boot option
[11:25] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock probaly samba cant access the file ..
[11:25] <eldragon> dcomsa: radeon driver is for older models, ive got an x600 which is supported by the ati drivers
[11:25] <Gunrun> where do I get the DVD install of ubuntu
[11:25] <Gunrun> or the alternate one?
[11:25] <cedricshock> nir_ai: Grub bootloader? Don't know how to change boot options off the top of my head, but add "single" (no quotes) to the list of options.
[11:25] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: ok i checkt your config with a friend .
[11:25] <aoirthoir> aight i'm on ubuntu 7.04. Now i saved my entire previous home dir..including my .gnome ...all I want to bring back are my settings for the bars at the top and the bottom without messing anything else up..is a simple copy of the .gnome ok or is there a better way?
[11:25] <BrokenLinux> !beryl
[11:25] <ubotu> Beryl is a window manager that takes advantage of an OpenGL accelerated X environment. See http://forum.beryl-project.org/ - Help in #ubuntu-effects
[11:25] <Gunrun> I am looking at http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download and don't see them :(
[11:26] <PovAddict> Gunrun: alternate is on the same place as desktop one
[11:26] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: and it is working (he just changed the paths .)
[11:26] <kzm> slackern: are you dutch? haha.. ik zit in amsterdam!
[11:26] <PovAddict> Gunrun: use the torrents!
[11:26] <michu> hi :D
[11:26] <Enselic_> I am trying to connect to my laptop X server from my desktop computer. I think I have setup everything correctly; this is a short shell session proving it: http://rafb.net/p/idcMXL97.html    anyone know why it doesn't work?
[11:26] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: so it must be permission problem
[11:26] <PovAddict> Gunrun: I'll get you linky
[11:26] <Gunrun> oh ok :)
[11:26] <slackern> kzm: No afraid not, im from Sweden
[11:26] <Gunrun> I like torrents
[11:26] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: ok i got a hint from a friend ..
[11:26] <shakya> jlib:  i am going to restart the live cd, then edit sources.list before i try to install java, will that work?
[11:26] <kc> When I start Beryl, it gets to "reloading options" and hangs? any suggestions?
[11:26] <PovAddict> Gunrun: http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/ubuntu-7.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
[11:26] <cabbey> anyone else having problems with dist upgrade when you have main,universe,restricted  set to use a local mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list, but multi-verse still set to the official ubuntu mirrors?
[11:26] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: try to change the owner of the files to nobody probly with chrown
[11:26] <starman> NON UBUNTU linux question if anyone is game:  is there a way to mount a gzipped tarball of a file system so you can read/write to the mount without having to actually decompress/compress the thing?
[11:27] <kzm> slackern: ah... was thinking because of the ".nl"
[11:27] <cedricshock> Wow, ubuntu+edubuntu+kubunut makes for a looong upgrade.
[11:27] <`Matir> hi... I'm trying to get Matlab 6/R12 to run on Ubuntu Edgy, but it's giving me no end of headaches trying to get the GUI working.  By default, it complains about not having a symbol __libc_wait in libjvm.so.  When attempting to use an external JVM, it segfaults with no error messages.
[11:27] <arthur_kalm> does anyone know how to remove an nvidia driver installed from the nvidia website?
[11:27] <eck> starman: no, because of how gzip compressoin works
[11:27] <davmor2> kzm:  try a fresh install and report the bug it seems that it is a bit messed up.
[11:27] <Supaplex> starman: no. not unless you use fuse and write your own.
[11:27] <erUSUL> starman: maybe a fuse plug in exist that can do that....
[11:27] <Gunrun> hmm I thought there was a DVD version of ubuntu :(
[11:27] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: what is the type of the /media/BUSLINK/music ? an mp3 player?
[11:27] <starman> bummer
[11:27] <PovAddict> Gunrun: there is, didn't find that link so fast :)
[11:27] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, Do I do sudo chown nobody /media/BUSLINK/music ?
[11:27] <eck> starman: if you stick something in the middle of a gzipped file, all the stuff after it needs to be changed
[11:28] <Gunrun> oh ok
[11:28] <PovAddict> Gunrun: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/7.04/release/ *use* *the* *torrents*
[11:28] <LeaChim> Heya, Has anyone used a Nova-T DVB-T Tuner with ubuntu dapper or feisty - if you had would you please pm me with the actual model and how easy it was to use? I need to deicde on one :P thanks
[11:28] <PovAddict> :D
[11:28] <tom_> Gunrun, why would you want one when it fits on a cd
[11:28] <slackern> kzm: oh hehe thats just the regular pastebin site, no idea why it's .nl though :)
[11:28] <arthur_kalm> i.e. the official nVidia driver, there doesn't seem to be anything in the readme that explains how to remove it
[11:28] <Gunrun> what does it have that the normal one doesn't?
[11:28] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock : no stop ..
[11:28] <eck> starman: so compressed filesystems are usually read only
[11:28] <starman> eck, yeah you know now that you mention it, I knew it all along...
[11:28] <LjL> tom_ i'm afraid i don't really know much about beryl, but there are a couple of options, if i recall correctly, that you do need to add to xorg.conf for beryl to work with nvidia cards. those probably got removed by the reconfigure. ask in #ubuntu-effects
[11:28] <Gunrun> tom_ I only have rewritable DVDs
[11:28] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: is it an mp3 player or something ?
[11:28] <tunganet> I am stuck at the Feisty upgrade. At the "preparing for upgrade" Fetching file 40 of 49, its stuck at 40 and not moving =.=
[11:28] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, The folder is a subdirectory on my external hard drive with all of my music.
[11:28] <starman> i was just thinking maybe someone smarter than I came up with something awesome
[11:28] <PovAddict> Gunrun: I'm kind of asking that and nobody answered me
[11:28] <doddo> Hi i wonder if its possible to start the install from a tty!
[11:28] <PovAddict> is DVD like alternate, or like desktop (live)?
[11:28] <LjL> tom_: or just check your backup copy of xorg.conf, and see which options they are
[11:28] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: with what option did you mount it ? umaks ?
[11:28] <Keldoor> I downloaded  .... NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9755-pkg1.run.... from nvida.. but don't know how to install it...
[11:29] <dcomsa> doddo: are you using the live cd?
[11:29] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, I never did any mount command.
[11:29] <tripsync> I am trying to get my native resolution to work in Ubuntu Fiesty, I have my Nvidia Geforce 5700 Ultra installed correctly, but i still dont have 1440x900 as an option, my monitor is being recognized as generic (hannsg JW199D), is there a way to get my resolution on the list?
[11:29] <kzm> davmor2: i will reboot... thanx for your help if you dont see me back soon, than i am fine...
[11:29] <Gunrun> PovAddict it says on that page doesn't it?
[11:29] <doddo> dcomsa: yeah
[11:29] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: What's the mtab entry, what does ls -l show in the parent directory?
[11:29] <Gunrun> that typing live will make it act like a live CD
[11:29] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, It automounts when plugged in.
[11:29] <starman> you know what makes ubuntu still such a pain for noobs to switch over to ?  All the post install config
[11:29] <Gunrun> otherwise its just an install
[11:29] <Supaplex> starman: yes, lots of things, but not what you describe. :) even a tarball would be prone to resizing on changes. (unless the file content sizes were the same before and after)
[11:29] <dcomsa> doddo: i would suggest the alternate cd
[11:29] <deoptima> hey is anyone else having a problem with OpenSSH with feisty?
[11:29] <PovAddict> Gunrun: yeah it says it's live - that will teach me to read
[11:29] <starman> I'm setting up a feisty laptop for my wife from scratch
[11:29] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: Try this command: cat /etc/mtab
[11:29] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: Sorry. I don't think I can help anymore
[11:29] <doddo> dcomsa: x wont load so i have to ctrl + alt into a tty
[11:29] <jrib> arthur_kalm: http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/1.0-9755/README/chapter-02-section-04.html
[11:29] <kzm> slackern: thanx for your help.. appreciate
[11:29] <Gunrun> I wish I knew what it had on it that the others didn't
[11:29] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: It should have a line about that folder (or maybe its parent)
[11:30] <dcomsa> doddo: the alternate cd has a text based installer
[11:30] <doddo> dcomsa: so thats the one i need to download?
[11:30] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, "/dev/sda1 /media/BUSLINK vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=077,iocharset=utf8 0 0
[11:30] <arthur_kalm> jrib: lol OK thank you, I should have looked harder :P
[11:30] <LaszloKv> "
[11:30] <dcomsa> doddo: yup
[11:30] <starman> and after I install, I have to set up wpa, codecs, japanese IME, tweak for performance gains (fstab modifications and journaling changes)
[11:30] <fiction> !codecs

[11:30] <dcomsa> doddo: then you could configure your X
[11:30] <starman> oh hdparms too
[11:30] <MalconRox> i m having problems with my soundcard.... Realtek acl660, what should i do?
[11:30] <AATDark> doddo: the alternate: ok umask is problem oder ?
[11:30] <jrib> arthur_kalm: it's ok, I knew where to look :)
[11:30] <starman> then set up beryl
[11:30] <slackern> kzm: no worries wish i could help more
[11:30] <AATDark> LaszloKv, AATDark: ok umask is the problem
[11:30] <deoptima> hey is anyone else having a problem with OpenSSH with feisty?
[11:30] <Lord_Maynoth_42> Are there any tools for customizing? ubuntu... like a way add and remove default packages on the cd
[11:30] <Gunrun> PovAddict I found what the DVD has over the CD: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=172304
[11:30] <doddo> dcomsa: thanx for the help =) theres nbo need to configure the x cause all i need it for is a shell server
[11:31] <starman> there is still a lot of manual work to setting up a good linux desktop
[11:31] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, Set umask to 777?
[11:31] <AATDark> LaszloKv, AATDark: no its invers .
[11:31] <AATDark> LaszloKv, AATDark: permission to all is 000

[11:31] <dcomsa> doddo: then try the server edition ;)
[11:31] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: no, 000

[11:31] <LsBlend> okay i need help installing 7.04
[11:32] <dcomsa> doddo: you're welcomed and good luck
[11:32] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: I dunno how to do that with automounted volumes.

[11:32] <HYPOCRISY> secret
[11:32] <jrib> shakya: why are you on the live cd anyway?
[11:32] <starman> LsBlend?
[11:32] <Cryoniq> Problem: I just upgraded to 7.04. And I am using a ATI Radeon 9800 Pro. When I start up gnome things are totaly laggy and strange, and beryl resulted in 100% white screen (configured for AIGLX DRI). This sounds familiar?
[11:32] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, And now do sudo mount -a ?
[11:32] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, see how its red? it wont let me mute/unmute. what does that even mean?
[11:32] <LsBlend> I cant partition the c drive to a dualboot
[11:32] <LeaChim> Heya, Has anyone used a Nova-T DVB-T Tuner with ubuntu dapper or feisty - if you had would you please pm me with the actual model and how easy it was to use? I need to deicde on one :P thanks
[11:32] <LsBlend> it wont let me
[11:32] <LsBlend> usung manual edit
[11:32] <starman> Cryoniq, check out beryl help pages...that's not ubuntu specific issue
[11:32] <starman> that is beryl and ati
[11:32] <LsBlend> so should i try gparted?
[11:32] <TashKavarish> what annoys me is it used to work i havent reinstalled or nothing
[11:33] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: This simply means it's used for capture.
[11:33] <elementz> hi everybody
[11:33] <brenix> search beryl ati ubuntu
[11:33] <brenix> there is a great guide for it and worked for me..
[11:33] <helge> q: what does the Ubuntu DVD contain that the CD doesn't?
[11:33] <starman> LsBlend, I dont know what gparted does
[11:33] <frandavid100> good evening!
[11:33] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, but if i cant mute/unmute, what can that mean? and the "L" and "R" ? what the firefox!
[11:33] <macaco> Hey guys how i can connect my old webcam Creative ?
[11:33] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock fstab shoudl work
[11:33] <Ashex> !info gparted
[11:33] <LsBlend> its a partitoner
[11:33] <ubotu> gparted: GNOME partition editor. In component main, is optional. Version 0.2.5-2ubuntu2 (feisty), package size 316 kB, installed size 1588 kB
[11:33] <Cryoniq> You sure because it worked excelent under edgy. I am just trying to understand what was changed from edgy regarding drivers and beryl when I upgraded to feisty.
[11:33] <macaco> pm please
[11:33] <starman> i could have guessed that
[11:34] <tom_> Join #ubuntu-effects
[11:34] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: write a line for your drive in the /etc/fstab file with umask=000
[11:34] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: notice above that you are changing only capture (bright yellow)
[11:34] <starman> Cryoniq, tons of things changed
[11:34] <starman> every package has versioned up
[11:34] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: change it to [all]  again.
[11:34] <frandavid100> I need some help here, can you tell me what command I need to type to mount /dev/hdc1 in /home/ubuntu/Desktop/carpeta ?
[11:34] <elementz> got an audio prob: edgy eft - external usb soundcard (creative audigy) does not play flash audio - instead the audio gets played on pc speaker (Intel ICH6)
[11:34] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: Easiest way to do that is to copy the line from /etc/mtab and modify it.
[11:34] <elementz> anybody got a solution to this?
[11:34] <shwag_> what language was del.icio.us  written in ? python?
[11:34] <Korgmatose> Cryoniq, try some of the git repos. I'm on a mixed 0.3.0/0.2.1+gi - version now, and it actually works (beryl/fglrx/xgl)
[11:34] <Gunrun> am I alowed to post links to forum posts here? I could do with some help with something, and its quite a complex issue
[11:34] <Cryoniq> starman, oki.. so the ati open source drivers was updated as well?
[11:34] <starman> mount /dev/hdc1 /home/ubuntu/Desktop/carpeta
[11:34] <starman> what filesystem is it?
[11:34] <starman> ext?
[11:34] <dcomsa> frandavid100:  sudo mount /devhdc1 /home/ubuntu/Desktop/carpeta
[11:35] <starman> oh yeah sudo
[11:35] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: (using tab)
[11:35] <starman> hehe ubuntu :p
=== caplink811 is now known as caplink811_log
[11:35] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, i changed it to capture to identify what things i should be messing w/
[11:35] <macaco> well i see ya later ... :D
[11:35] <ixian_> I'm not sure what I did, but when I try to enable desktop effects, I get a 'Composite extension not available' error. It was working when I installed Feisty yesterday. any ideas?
[11:35] <starman> I'm a shameless sudo overrider, I always sudo su
[11:35] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: /etc/mtab lists mounted filesystems, and fstab is where mount reads defaults from.
[11:35] <cotton> Do I have to download all the ubuntu files and reupload them to my server, or can I just upload, like 1 desktop ISO and the docs and still be listed as a mirror
[11:35] <TashKavarish> how do i force gnome to use a certain resolution?(1920x1200@58Hz), ddcprobe lists it but putting it in xorg.conf doesnt work
[11:36] <frandavid100> dcomsa sudo mount /devhdc1 /home/ubuntu/Desktop/carpeta ??
[11:36] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, back under "all" and under the same "mic" one i have it almost to the top in the red zone
[11:36] <nir_ai> cedricshock: There is no 'single' option available for boot commands
[11:36] <dcomsa> frandavid100: huh ... in a terminal ...
[11:36] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, it says 'captr' and all that beneath it too
[11:36] <elementz> anybody here who would be able to help with my prob stated above? pls help
[11:36] <frandavid100> alrighty
[11:36] <starman> TashKavarish, xorg.conf hacking time for you my friend
[11:36] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: Is it MM or OO?
[11:36] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, And do sudo mount -a after editing fstab?
[11:36] <Lord_Maynoth_42> Does anyone know what tools are required to make custom livecd's?
[11:36] <AATDark> cedricshock thx now i have little bit more linux knowledge .. im
[11:36] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: y
[11:36] <starman> TashKavarish, if xorg.conf already lists the resolution, it's easy to switch
[11:36] <LjL> !customlivecd > Lord_Maynoth_42    (Lord_Maynoth_42, see the private message from Ubotu)
[11:37] <starman> actually the GUI has controls to change resolutions
[11:37] <TashKavarish> starman: no it isnt
[11:37] <TashKavarish> xorg has it, gnome wont use it
[11:37] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: Sure, but you;ll need to unmount it first.
[11:37] <Keldoor> im running the nvidia installer... and it asks for... "binutils".. be installed where would i get them?
[11:37] <Lord_Maynoth_42> thank you
[11:37] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, I dont know what you mean
[11:37] <starman> TashKavarish, xorg.conf will list all capable resolutions
[11:37] <starman> but doesnt mean that one is selected
[11:37] <Korgmatose> !apt-get > Keldoor
[11:37] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, How do I unmount?
[11:37] <TashKavarish> it list 1920x1200, it wont use it still.
[11:37] <LjL> Lord_Maynoth_42: there are also third-party tools not described there, which do slightly or less slightly different things... i'm afraid i don't remember the names though

[11:47] <captaintrips> ok, thx
[11:47] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: That'll do it. So would sudo mount /media/BUSLINK. The first will try to mount everythign that isn't mounted yet
[11:47] <TashKavarish> i know so far my best guess is the latest nvidia driver disabled it
[11:47] <Jonah> im having a problem with GRUB. my bootdisk is SATA and my ubuntu install is on a PATA drive. but the install refuse to install GRUB on the SATA drive, so i dont get any boot menu, it just boots directly to windows.

[11:47] <CheshireViking> just upgraded to 7.04 from 6.10 using dist. upgrade, only problem i've got is my nvidia card won't display at its normal 1600*1200 resolution, max i can get with nvidia is 800*600 with opengl/3d working, if i use "nv" as the driver i get 1600*1200 but no opengl/3d, graphics card is an old geforce2 so i have to use legacy driver, any suggestions? i've uninstalled, reinstalled legacy driver, tried using envy, no success, xorg is at ht
[11:47] <CheshireViking> tp://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16663/ Anybody with a suggestion?
[11:47] <brenix> ah looks like it is already updated

After the login screen I just get the orage background with a white squre in the upper left and it won't go any further. booting to recovery mode is no problem. I'm thinking an xorg.conf problem. any suggestions?
[11:48] <makuseru> anyone know what the room for Ubuntu Studio is?
[11:48] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, you had to play w/ alsamixer before you could get the playback to work correctly? do you mind telling me what did the trick?
[11:48] <shakya> it says 'could not find libjava.so, could not find java 2 runtime environment'
[11:48] <shakya> anyone know why?
[11:48] <slackern> kzm: just remove the symbolic links i guess should undo it?
[11:48] <Jordan_U> shakya, You need to remove sun-java5-bin but unfortunately removing it will probably fail if the postinst script fails
[11:48] <astronouth7303> is it safe to kill klogd?

[11:50] <GionnyBoss> what's the best way to backup my windows partition before resizing it? I was thinking something like "dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/my/image.iso , but the problem is that I want to reduce partition size, so I won't be able to restore my partition data with dd again (dd will does a .iso as large as partition total size). Any suggestions, please?
[11:50] <Xyon> but not text-only
[11:50] <zaphands> MrMakeveli: did it ever work on a linux system?
[11:50] <slackern> kzm: if you reinstalll the drivers from the repositories they will probably overwrite them i guess there will be a fix out for it soon though since it's confirmed also in the buglist
[11:50] <ryeth25> anybody familiar with screen and irssi?
[11:50] <AATDark> Xyon: tried noacpi already at boot shell ?

[11:50] <MrMakeveli> zaphands, no, this is the first time i have tried using it on linux

[11:50] <GreatBriton> who else has experienced feisty and networkmanager's problems with rt2500 wifi cards?
[11:50] <Xyon> should i exit to command line at bootloader?
[11:50] <TashKavarish> k
[11:50] <cedricshock> Xyon: It turns off some often troublesome power management.
[11:50] <Jordan_U> Xyon, OK, you now need to use the Alternate install CD to do what is called a "chroot" where you can install the ati drivers to your installed system from the alternate install CD
[11:50] <Xyon> and try noacpi?
[11:51] <AATDark> Xyon: im not sure .. but sometimes it helps (acpi is a enegy saving interface)
[11:51] <Xyon> okayh
[11:51] <tesuki> have ubuntu 7.04 remvoed support for old pata disks?

[11:52] <sinizzl> i just installed ubuntu on my macbook and it directly boots into grub and it doesnt let me select mac os X..... can i configure grub to let me choose between ubuntu and and mac os x?

[11:52] <Shoeb> Quick question: how can I reverse -> echo "alias net-pf-10 off" > /etc/modprobe.d/bad_list -> It apparently switches off ipv6. But since I did this it broke my networking.. I have to manually restart networking when it boots up to get it connected. It worked fine before this ipv6 thing.
[11:52] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, Actually, there's nothing new in the log, strangely enough.
[11:52] <elementz> pls somebody help me with my audio: flash sound gets output only on pc speaker for some strange reason - i normally use usb audio
[11:52] <elementz> pleeeze help
[11:52] <GreatBriton> Jonah, if grub is on the sata drive, can't you boot from the sata drive?
[11:52] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: even if you restart samba ?
[11:52] <Jonah> slackern: i read about super grub and tried to download that, but the link is not working. would that be an option if i can find the image somewhere?
[11:52] <gerzel> Q: I just upgraded to Fiesty today.  My sound card is an Audigy, one of the first ones.  I had sound before the upgrade, now I don't.  I even tried the jacks on the motherboard nothing.

[11:52] <AATDark> Blubloblu: i think you can add  ro debug at grub
[11:52] <LaszloKv> AATDark, cedricshock, I restarted samba before the connect.
[11:52] <TashKavarish> speaking of networking, anyone have 2 adapters in the same box that constantly swap their ip config and knows how to stop em doing so ?
[11:52] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: What does "ls -l /media" say for that folder now?
[11:53] <Keldoor> The Nvidia installer tells me to shut down "Xserver" is that running in console mode compleatly..?
[11:53] <Jonah> great: grub refuse to install to the SATA drive
[11:53] <dcomsa> Shoeb: manually edit /etc/modprobe.d/bad_list and remove that line
[11:53] <slackern> kzm: hehe well this x1950 card is no joyride, trust me about that, i would toss it out for a nvidia card any day :)
[11:53] <ulf_am_beat> Congratulations!
[11:53] <slackern> Jonah: sorry no idea what super grub does
[11:53] <Shoeb> dcomsa: I was *just* doing that.. doesn't look like that file was even created.
[11:53] <sinizzl> anyone knows howto use mac os x together with ubuntu ?
[11:53] <Shoeb> dcomsa: So, that out of the way.. what could be causing me to manually /etc/init,d/networking restart, and not able to get an addr on boot?

[11:59] <trumpet_thief> wow did i find a  fast server feisty is downloading at 700kbs
[11:59] <Blubloblu> i editing grub from grub itself
[11:59] <AATDark> Blubloblu: you can try to boot the "Rescue " entry in grubs boot men . This wont give you an X Server but it says more stuff
[11:59] <gabriela> help my system can not iniciate the x server
[11:59] <Jonah> Jordan_U: yes, but im a linux n00b, so i didnt get very far before i was lost :-(
[11:59] <Tusk> why do I have colored lines down my screen vertically when I try to use the "nvidia" driver?
[11:59] <cedricshock> LaszloKv, AATDark: Ok. That's good. There's definitely enough permisions for samba to be dancing around. Back to samba hen I guess.
[11:59] <Jonah> possible to add linux to windows boot menu?
[12:00] <miki__> hi
[12:00] <LjL> Jonah: not sure, probably not. but you can add windows to the linux boot menu (i.e. to GRUB)
[12:00] <LjL> !dualboot > Jonah    (Jonah, see the private message from Ubotu)
[12:00] <mwe> Jonah: I think so. Probably easier to add windows to the linux boot menu, though.
[12:00] <cedricshock> Jonah: Yes, if you've installed a boot loader somewhere other than on the MBR. It's done via the windows boot.ini file.
[12:00] <Tusk> why the hell am I being ignored?
[12:00] <dcomsa> Ranbee: still here
[12:00] <gumjo> my window menubar has dissapeared after installing beryl/compiz... any help?

[12:01] <AATDark> LaszloKv, cedricshock: ok try to edit the path of the music share to /home and try again
[12:01] <JoseStefan> Every since feisty upgrade, I'm getting doubled swap, like if it was mounted twice, is that a problem?

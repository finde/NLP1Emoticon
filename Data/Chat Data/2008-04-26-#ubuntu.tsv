00:00	<ethana2>	nucco: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection on a fresh Ubuntu 8.04 install is not seeing any wireless networks
00:00	<KooperKool>	So Ubuntu Wont get messed up?
00:00	<nucco>	Steve^ he he
00:00	<hwilde>	josh04, it would
00:00	<Derspankster>	KooperKool; you'll be on a command line
00:00	<hwilde>	josh04, KooperKool, NO that will uninstall all dependencies
00:00	<Steve^>	nucco, 2 gig of swap is enough?
00:00	<josh04>	hwile, KooperKool: Depends on whether it's being removed because it's uninstalled part of the default setup
00:00	<nucco>	Steve^ yes,
00:01	<nucco>	Steve^ above that is usually not necessary.
00:01	<IndyGunFreak>	Steve^, rule of thumb for swap 2-2.5x amount of ram
00:01	<KooperKool>	because I want to install gnome-audio and it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop and ubuntu-sounds. I dont care for ubuntu-sounds, but ubuntu-desktop?
00:01	<doug2266778822>	mov when u do dmesg in term after u get the error from the player you get something like this?   http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64445/
00:01	<unop>	roffe__, the output doesn't indicate what is really missing ... it just says "checking for MODULES... no"  which is really vague --  perhaps there's something ./configure does that might help.    what does this output.   ./configure --help
00:01	<IndyGunFreak>	but nucco is right, unless your running a 500mhz, more than 2gigs is probably redundant
00:01	<heartsblood>	Does anybody here play UrbanTerror?
00:01	<J-a-k-e>	ripps: my sound card is a x-fi xtreme audio, there aren't any tone options for me. I've tried playing with eq settings in amarok which has helped .. a bit. I'm actually running windows at the moment default bass and treble settings, music sounds heaps better compared to ubuntu
00:01	<IndyGunFreak>	KooperKool, that is a meta package, its not gonna remove the desktop

00:05	<jmei>	shift and capslock stopped working. hardy , no scim installed, USA keyboard layout set as default.
00:05	<roffe__>	ethana2: yeah, well, the guy you're helping, ask him to simply reboot it.. my friend did that after a long time, and then finally it was found, with that same card of his

00:20	<hwilde>	Tristam, buy a supported card
00:20	<IndyGunFreak>	Tristam: lol, buy atheros.

00:20	<Pelo>	otarid, find and remove the config file for the network manager , and reboot
00:20	<Wo0dy>	and are backports treated seriously? I don't know what to do.. I'd like to upgrade, but people complain of bugs in new releases.. so on one hand 7.04 works fine for me, on the other hand, I want to upgrade
00:21	<falcon4ever_>	jack: ok thanks
00:21	<josh04>	Tristam: edit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist and add two lines
00:21	<Pelo>	B_166-ER-X, no need to repeat so often , try asking in #compiz

00:21	<R3D3Y3>	Anyone have any success with the XFI driver and 8.04 ?
00:21	<Jack_Sparrow>	woodwizzle, you cant go directly to 804 anyhow so go to 710 as most of the bugs have been fixed in it
00:21	<BortNeedsHelp>	Ok.. so i completely deleted windows and installed ubuntu... but every time i reboot i get "windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: <Windows root>\system32\hal.dll" wtf...
00:21	<Pelo>	Wo0dy, what are your general hadware specks ?
00:21	<Starnestommy>	ipx: then reconnect

00:21	<ipx>	Starnestommy: thanks, but what do I type after the @? Isnt that different on different servers?
00:22	<kevin__>	Hello. I wondering, is there anyway to get Network Manager to work in Fluxbox?
00:22	<Pelo>	BortNeedsHelp, can you boot ubuntu ?
00:22	<Wo0dy>	Pelo: it's a sony vaio vgn-fe41e, some guy previously complained that his wireless (intel) stopped working in 8.04
00:22	<BortNeedsHelp>	i can boot off the disk
00:22	<BortNeedsHelp>	Pelo
00:22	<Wo0dy>	Pelo: wireless, of course, is vital for me
00:22	<otarid>	Well... I'm on windows right now.. I guess I'll reboot and try to use my father's computer to get back to you..
00:22	<Starnestommy>	ipx: the thing after the @ is always your hostname or IP unless you have a vhost or cloak on that network
00:22	<IndyGunFreak>	brb..
00:22	<ipx>	Starnestommy: thanks alot mate =)
00:22	<Canaris_>	Are there any reports about nvidia-glx-new causing sluggishness in 8.04 ??
00:23	<rain>	no one knows here?
00:23	<dassouki>	i followed the "!sound" guidelines and i can't get my sound to work on hardy. i don't know if it has anything to do wiht the new kernel and pulse audio. my alsa worked perfect on gutsy
00:23	<moveax>	Can you guys suggest a tool for recording my desktop? I'd like to show a friend my awn dock in action :)
00:23	<Pelo>	Wo0dy, I woudn't bet my life on a smoth upgrade with any wifi at this moment but I sugest your check in the forum with the words wifi  and hardy ,  or some such combination
00:23	<josh04>	dassouki: What's the problem?
00:23	<Odd-rationale>	moveax: gtk-recordmydesktop
00:23	<Pelo>	BortNeedsHelp,  wen do you get the msg ?
00:23	<chcampb>	ello
00:23	<Jack_Sparrow>	BortNeedsHelp, did you tell ubuntu install to use the entire drive or did you specify a partition possibly leaving bits of windows on the drive

00:24	<Pelo>	BortNeedsHelp, ok you mean you are on the live cd atm ?
00:24	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: what error message do you get>
00:24	<BortNeedsHelp>	ive installed it on two separate drives... I have filled up all the drives with the portion
00:24	<josh04>	Darknezz: How is it not working?
00:24	<dassouki>	josh04, if i do an lspci -b or ldconfig, i can see my audio card, if i go on system .. sound .. and test the sound i get no sound
00:24	<BortNeedsHelp>	im on my laptop now, but live cd is up on desktop
00:24	<Pelo>	Darknezz, sudo apt-get install build-essential
00:24	<Wo0dy>	Pelo: I'm thinkin on doing a clean install. I'm pretty sure that I'd screw everything if I go through 2 releases (from 7.04 ->	7.10 ->	8.04). my wireless is intel 3945ABG
00:24	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: i get make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
00:25	<Canaris_>	Wo0dy, definitely a clean install
00:25	<josh04>	dassouki: Is there anything interesting in your dmesg?
00:25	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: run ./configure
00:25	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i have downloaded that
00:25	<genii>	Darknezz: Try first: ./configure
00:25	<Odd-rationale>	moveax: this might interest you: http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/linuxjournalcom/~3/276285304/make-screencast
00:25	<Pelo>	Wo0dy,  I still recommend you check comments in the forum on this,  or at least try in live cd to see ifyour wifi card is detected properly
00:25	<Canaris_>	Wo0dy, just backup your data and start with a clean install. pretty much only has advantages. besides it just takes a bit longer
00:25	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, you will also need your kernel headers
00:25	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: i ran that just befor i tryed make
00:25	<Pelo>	Darknezz, did you ./configure first to chck for dependencies ?
00:25	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: what was the output of ./configure?

00:26	<chcampb>	...on tracker.... how would i find this password and/or change it?
00:26	<Pelo>	BortNeedsHelp, does the computer come with a windows recovery partitons ?

00:28	<Gman99999>	josh04 ok where do i find the mixer its all different now with the pulse audio
00:28	<Wo0dy>	but yeah, seeing all these problems people report early after a new release, maybe I should download a live cd image too, before betting everything on 8.04
00:28	<heartsblood>	What is the name of the tool that is found in system/preferences/"screen resolution"?  I think it trying to set conflicting configurations on my system.

00:35	<Pelo>	phixxor, full  main and restricted repositories on the dvd , saves on some install download and  both live cd and text install
00:35	<seamus7>	happy_tux open system monitor and check what version is says you're running
00:35	<IndyGunFreak>	poseidon: you need to run gksudo nvidia-settings
00:35	<otarid>	Pelo: How would I do that? (reconfiguring x-server)
00:35	<Wo0dy>	do you remember, people complained like that when 7.04 was released? As I said, it worked almost perfectly for me, but if people had problems also back then, then I'll upgrade. If 7.04 is known as a better release than it's followers, then I'll stick with it.
00:35	<ronartos>	how to know if ubuntu 8.04 detects my video card correctly?
00:35	<Wo0dy>	guess that the solution is to just fetch a live cd and see how that works for me..
00:35	<Pelo>	otarid, sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
00:35	<mophead>	userx86: this is the support channel.  if you need help withi something, please feel free to ask.  If not, just wait around for someone to ask a question you can help them with
00:36	<Abd>	i guess i'de better backup all my data and make a full install instead of the upgrade and see if hardy detects it
00:36	<happy_tux>	it says 8.04
00:36	<ronartos>	seems that xorg.conf shows diffrently
00:36	<t0dz>	uhm...
00:36	<happy_tux>	but it said that on beta i think
00:36	<Pelo>	Wo0dy, use torrents, save the servers some load
00:36	<t0dz>	can sombody help me ?

00:36	<Meshezabeel>	happy_tux, you do not need to upgrade from 8.04 to 8.04
00:36	<Pelo>	dan__,  youc an't do it with a live cd,  only with the dvd or the alternate install cd
00:36	<chcampb>	pelo: that second page i hadnt seen, the first i did... it mentioned /etc/samba/smb.conf - i checked that, and there are no passwords in that location.... it does, however, mention the general passwd program - i tried that program, man'd it, and it does not have any flags that will allow me to view/edit the samba password as opposed to the unix password.... and now im back to zero
00:36	<Sergiu9>	hello
00:37	<dan__>	thought so
00:37	<happy_tux>	ah ok THANKS!
00:37	<ronartos>	xorg.conf  only shows  on my display device ==========  "Configured Display Driver"
00:37	<mophead>	Sergiu9 >	hi!
00:37	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: make sure that libglib1.2 and libglib1.2-dev are both installed
00:37	<t0dz>	!ask im stuck in this xchat... i need to chance ident...
00:37	<Theo_>	windows: ntdlr is missing press escape to restart. what do i do?
00:37	<Meshezabeel>	happy_tux, upgrading is if you are going from 7.10 to 8.04
00:37	<Sergiu9>	it is possible to upgrade gutsy alternate with hardy alternate cd?
00:37	<Pelo>	chcampb,  I don'T realy know anyting about samba you are asking the wrong person
00:37	<dan__>	my friend steve thought the live would work
00:37	<Sergiu9>	mophead hi
00:37	<ronartos>	how to know if ubuntu 8.04 detects my video card correctly?
00:37	<amenado>	dan__->	do you need to really update or you can install another, assuming you have enuff spaces..
00:37	<Steve^>	I did?
00:37	<Steve^>	;)
00:37	<chcampb>	ok, thanks.
00:37	<josh04>	illDecree: What card?
00:37	<Abd>	teamcobra does the bcm4311 works with bcm 4312?
00:37	<dan__>	naw, i need to update
00:37	<bsrat>	what does the webpage mean by '3 years of free updates'
00:37	<Pelo>	t0dz, ask in #xchat
00:38	<astro76>	Sergiu9: you can use the hardy alternate cd to upgrade... it doesn't matter how you installed gutsy
00:38	<mophead>	ronartos: you will get a better response if you say which card you are using and what you are running
00:38	<dan__>	and update manager isnt good for release updates
00:38	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both
00:38	<Starnestommy>	t0dz: are you trying to change your ident?
00:38	<t0dz>	thx bro
00:38	<illDecree>	from what i can tell... this laptop has the cheap s3 unichrome.   i copied over the drivers to the desktop, just in case i need them.
00:38	<Steve^>	bsrat, you will get seurity updates for 8.04 for the next 3 years
00:38	<t0dz>	yeah
00:38	<Sergiu9>	astro76 thanks
00:38	<Sergiu9>	np
00:38	<Sergiu9>	:)
00:38	<Tonisius>	what is themethod called when you insert from a select call?
00:38	<t0dz>	i puted xx "for my name" and then that now my ident..
00:38	<bsrat>	as in LTS..
00:38	<Pelo>	bsrat, means that hardy is gonna get 3 years of support , because it is a LTS ,   the others only get 18 months,   for patches and security fixes
00:38	<bsrat>	ah ok
00:38	<teamcobra>	Abd: they're 2 conflicts in the b43 driver in 2.6.24..... I know for certain they fixed it in the new kernel, as I have the bcm4311rev02... been following this issue for a while ;)
00:38	<Starnestommy>	t0dz: /set irc_user_name new-ident
00:38	<Shpook>	Oh no, I've got more problems. I had a failed upgrade last night due to a lost wireless connection(I believe). Now today when I boot up my laptop, it tells me that there is a file system problem on sda1, and forces fsck. The fsck fails, mounts the root files system in read-only, and loads a maintenance shell. Thing is, I never had anything mounted as sda. sda is reserved for USB devices and such, correct?
00:38	<josh04>	illDecree: Can't help, sorry.
00:39	<joetheodd>	Are the repositories still bogged down?
00:39	<ronartos>	mophead: Intel 945GM
00:39	<Mimi>	Hey... why are my arrow diferent colors depending on which window it is? :P
00:39	<Pelo>	t0dz,  can you summerize your issue in one line , this is a busy channel
00:39	<andril>	my upgrade went ok so far - but my sourcelist still has some Gutsy items - and I can change the cd to Heron - any help?
00:39	<Pelo>	joetheodd, expect it for one week at lest
00:39	<cod3rz>	.
00:39	<seamus7>	t0dz just go into System/Administration/UsersandGroups to change your username
00:39	<Pelo>	least
00:39	<josh04>	Shpook: sda can also be SATA drives
00:39	<t0dz>	lol
00:39	<amenado>	Shpook->	nope
00:39	<userx86>	sphook my hard drive partitions are listed as /dev/sda
00:39	<illDecree>	josh04: you dont think it will work?
00:39	<t0dz>	i will tape all in 1
00:39	<t0dz>	wait a momento :P
00:39	<mophead>	ronartos: I can't help, but ask again with all the info
00:39	<MrRoboto>	Is Pulseaudio installed by default in Hardy?
00:39	<joetheodd>	Pelo :(. I agree with whoever said releases shouldn't hit the repositories until torrents have been going for a week or so.
00:39	<Starnestommy>	MrRoboto: I think so
00:39	<Pelo>	andril, just uncheck it in the software sources , in the admin menu
00:40	<josh04>	illDecree: No, i just don't know how to make it work :P Never used an S3 card
00:40	<MrRoboto>	Starnestommy:  Well I can't see it
00:40	<Shpook>	josh04, amenado, userx86: so, you're telling me this is bad news then?
00:40	<Abd>	teamcobra so I guess the problem sis really on my laptop. I'll make a fresh install of hardy, maybe the problems get solved
00:40	<Jack_Sparrow>	joetheodd, agreed
00:40	<otarid>	Pelo: reconfiguring xserver didn't work (just asked me about keyboard and mouse)
00:40	<Pelo>	joetheodd, well at least 24 hrs but tehre are still a lot of ppl that will try and upgrade online
00:40	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both
00:40	<ronartos>	mophead: It's not very specific to my video card.. but how xorg.conf now display settings
00:40	<Pelo>	otarid, try the binari driver then
00:40	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm not sure what's causing it
00:40	<andril>	Pelo: i did but there seemd to be less Heron compared to Gutsy
00:40	<josh04>	Shpook: Not necessarily. It might just be a SATA drive :P
00:40	<ronartos>	is there anyway I can check which card ubuntu 8.04 detected?
00:40	<userx86>	sphook i barely understand the nature of your problem, i just know that sda isn't necessarily removable storage
00:40	<Pelo>	otarid,  did you restart X after you reconfigured ?
00:40	<amenado>	Shpook->	all am saying is sda does not get tied to USB devices
00:40	<d4t4min32>	can someone help me with connetion issues, i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager >
00:40	<josh04>	otarid: you don't have an intel 965 do you?
00:40	<otarid>	no
00:41	<otarid>	let me try that
00:41	<teamcobra>	abd: no
00:41	<joetheodd>	Pelo, the thing is, I'm still on the old one and I just want to install Azureus. I can't even download headers without timing out.
00:41	<alienzero>	anybody know how to make the alt+tab behavior revert to the old style (it shows all windows at once)?
00:41	<teamcobra>	Abd: the problem _won't_ get solved
00:41	<Pelo>	andril, how did you upgrade anyway ?
00:41	<bsrat>	can i add a 500Gb sata as primary and boot from that, and have an option to boot from current xp install on secondary sata which is 300Gb?
00:41	<d4t4min32>	for some reason it just wont connect.. i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager >	pasted in paste bin
00:41	<joetheodd>	Is there any way to change the timeout that APT uses when connecting to repositories?
00:41	<illDecree>	josh04: alright... thanks!
00:41	<andril>	network
00:41	<t0dz>	ok lets see... im new in this bissness and i installed xchat (use allways befor mirc @ win) and when i open it (xchat) it asked me about name and there i put xx (i thougt it was my nick) and then when i try to connect to my psybnc then i cant becouse its wrong ident.. and i connected to normal server there i did /whois t0dz and there i see this xx what i thougt was my nick...
00:41	<andril>	Pelo:network
00:41	<Pelo>	joetheodd, use your live cd ,,  there are repos on it , I beleive az is in main
00:41	<mophead>	alienzero: I think it would be in the compiz preferences
00:41	<Radit>	(06:41:08 AM) Radit: Does anybody know how to make a shortcut using the superL (windows key) work?
00:41	<teamcobra>	Abd: until you compile + install 2.6.25 (which isn't gonna be supported in hardy)
00:41	<mariorz>	hi! what is the package name that instal gcc and all the dev studd?
00:41	<amenado>	alienzero->	does is not the old behaviour, it just switches between gui apps
00:41	<Jack_Sparrow>	t0dz, FYI  /join #Xchat
00:41	<nomasteryoda>	oh so nice to see ubuntu+1 gone for a bit
00:41	<mariorz>	s/studd/stuff
00:42	<Starnestommy>	t0dz: do this: /set irc_user_name NEW-IDENT
00:42	<Shpook>	josh04, amenado: Well, my laptop only has one hdd, which I believe is sata. Are there any options I should use when I run fsck manually?
00:42	<Starnestommy>	mariorz: build-essential
00:42	<Pelo>	andril, hmmm,  well you can always edit /etc/apt/sources.list  and comment out the gutsy lines,   just comment them out , don'T delete them  , just incase
00:42	<alienzero>	mophead: ok, I'll check that out
00:42	<d4t4min32>	can anyone help me with connection problems
00:42	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz sudo apt-get install build-essential
00:42	<d4t4min32>	interenet connection issues
00:42	<mariorz>	Starnestommy: thankyou!
00:42	<dan__>	windows key will now be referred to as Satan key
00:42	<phixxor>	thanks pelo!
00:42	<mariorz>	KiwiJoker: dont we use aptitude now? :P
00:42	<amenado>	Shpook->	i cant recall the options of fsck, perhaps -y  for repair all?
00:42	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32 is it wifi or wired?
00:42	<phixxor>	windows isn't THAT bad
00:42	<d4t4min32>	wifi
00:42	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz ?
00:43	<nomasteryoda>	ok
00:43	<Abd>	teamcobra so unless i get a wireless pccard supported by hardy, my problem is not solved
00:43	<mariorz>	aptitude
00:43	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: wifi
00:43	<Tristam>	josh04, http://pastebin.com/d60bc50dd
00:43	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, ok... what chipset ?
00:43	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz we do?
00:43	<teamcobra>	Abd: just compile the new kernel, it'll work automagically, I promise ;)
00:43	<mariorz>	im pretty sure
00:43]  * Pelo receives thanks and he doesn't even remember what he's being thanke for ,  busy channel indeed
00:43	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: do you want to see my paste bin of cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager >
00:43	<mneptok>	mariorz: i use apt-get. most of my colleagues do, too. make of that what you will.
00:43	<teamcobra>	Abd: it's free ;P
00:43	<Darknezz>	has anyone installed xmms2 successfully on hardy?
00:43	<Abd>	lol
00:43	<Shpook>	amenado: Sounds good. Thank you. :-)
00:43	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: i have a wusb54gv4 wifi and a 54gs router
00:43	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, URL?
00:43	<Pelo>	Darknezz, isn't it in the repos ?
00:43	<nomasteryoda>	ok
00:43	<Jack_Sparrow>	Pelo, been there, accept it and keep running
00:43]  * phixxor nods in agreement
00:44	<nomad>	whats up with the hardy docs. Nothing at help.ubuntu.com. where is best?
00:44	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: http://pastebin.com/d1cef6397
00:44	<Pelo>	Jack_Sparrow, ain'T alzeihmer fun ?
00:44	<Darkside>	hello, urgent help requited
00:44	<Darkside>	required*
00:44	<Pelo>	Darkside, state the problem
00:44	<Abd>	teamcobra because i'm quite a noob with kernel compiling, i have to get someone patiente enough to help me
00:44	<Jack_Sparrow>	Pelo, every time
00:44	<Genotrius>	Okay, so! GNOME strangely vanished from me the day of the update. If anyone's willing, I'd like to talk to someone about whether or not upgrading will fix it.
00:44	<amenado>	Shpook->	you're welcome
00:44	<happy_tux>	using the alternative cd i can boot up my laptop(hp 6710b) to the menu then select install......then blank screen!...no cd activity????
00:44	<Darkside>	my laptop isn't charging its battery... ubuntu is reporting it as at 0% and fully charged
00:44	<otarid>	Pelo: Okay, restarting did solve the resolution problem, thanks!
00:44	<teamcobra>	Abd: it's not too hard... hardest part is picking all of your config options
00:44	<Darkside>	is there a way to force ACPI to charge?
00:44	<teamcobra>	1 sec, lemme get you some links
00:44	<josh04>	Tristam: do you have the driver installed with ndiswrapper?
00:44	<Darknezz>	Pelo: ya i downloaded it and it seems to be installed but i cant see it under sound and video
00:44	<mariorz>	mneptok: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/aptitude
00:44	<alienzero>	Darknezz: I just tried, but it didn't show up in the main menu
00:44	<Pelo>	Genotrius,  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
00:45	<happy_tux>	after kernel loading
00:45	<manfromns>	can someone help me? i upgraded to Hardy and now i don't see a surround tab in the Alsa settings
00:45	<happy_tux>	dialogue box
00:45	<Darknezz>	alienzero: same here is that a bug?
00:45	<otarid>	josh: 965M
00:45	<nomasteryoda>	i read thru... bb in a bit
00:45	<mneptok>	mariorz: what about it?
00:45	<Pelo>	Darknezz, try starting it from the command line,   if that works   edit the menu from  system >	prefs >	main menu
00:45	<Genotrius>	Well, not exactly vanished.
00:45	<Tristam>	Josh04, I used the System/Administration/Windows Wireless Drivers app to install it
00:45	<priman>	is there any way to install ubuntu on a raid0 system without cleaning the disk?
00:45	<Pelo>	Darknezz, hardly urgent
00:45	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, does the battery charge with the computer shut down?
00:45	<Abd>	teamcobra yes that's what i'm affraid of, i'm not expeienced at that
00:45	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: anything stick out
00:45	<Genotrius>	I'm on failsafe GNOME right now.
00:45	<mariorz>	mneptok: ?
00:45	<gtyu>	l
00:45	<josh04>	manfromns: Someone else may correct me, but I don't think pulseaudio supports surround
00:45	<otarid>	okay
00:45	<mophead>	manfromns: did you try going to preferences and making sure everything ischecked?
00:45	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: that could be a problem
00:45	<mneptok>	mariorz: what about that link?
00:45	<alienzero>	Darknezz: Dunno - I was using xxms on 6.x with no problems
00:46	<josh04>	otarid: Same :P Is it working now?
00:46	<d4t4min32>	anyone else that could assist, my paste bin is located here http://pastebin.com/d1cef6397     im having wifi issues
00:46	<teamcobra>	Abd: http://howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu   ,  http://www.linuxheadquarters.com/howto/tuning/kernelsources.shtml     ..... don't be afraid, it'll make you r33t ;) and to be honest, you shouldn't have to change any config stuff
00:46	<Theo_>	how do I fix windows if it says its missing files?
00:46	<Pelo>	Genotrius, still do the command I gave you
00:46	<Darkside>	anybody have any idea about forcing ACPI to charge my battery?
00:46	<mariorz>	mneptok: tough you might want to read it
00:46	<manfromns>	i tried but there is no surround option
00:46	<mophead>	josh04: I think you're right, it doesn't
00:46	<manfromns>	unlike gutsy
00:46	<teamcobra>	Abd: this is how you learn, right? ;)
00:46	<mariorz>	s/tough/tought
00:46	<Genotrius>	Well, I'll try it, but I don't think reinstalling it is what I need to do...
00:46	<mneptok>	mariorz: if you are recommending aptitude, i think you should read it. :)
00:46	<josh04>	Tristam: Does it show as installed, present if you type ndiswrapper -l at the prompt? (You don't need to blacklist the modules for this)
00:46	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, does the battery charge with the computer shut down?
00:46	<otarid>	josh04: Resolution is fine now, still have a problem with getting desktop effects and networking to work
00:46	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darkside, , does the battery charge with the computer shut down
00:47	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, so its not doing the wpa authentication... have you tried it on an open wifi connection?
00:47	<KiwiJoker>	mneptok exactly what i was thinking lol
00:47	<Pelo>	Darkside, isn'T battery recharge a hardware thing ?
00:47	<Darkside>	well you can control it in the bios too
00:47	<mneptok>	mariorz: especially this bit: "So the points outlined on this page about using aptitude over apt-get are largely irrelevant if you're using Edgy Eft (6.10), Feisty Fawn (7.04), or any future version of Ubuntu."
00:47	<nomasteryoda>	someone else please help d4t4min32
00:47	<Abd>	teambobra thanks for your tips, i'll try to do that. Thanks again
00:47	<mophead>	Pelo: mine did the same thing for a while
00:47	<Darknezz>	Pelo: as in typing xmms2? i did that all it says is all the commands like (play, stop, ect)
00:47	<nomasteryoda>	have to run
00:47	<teamcobra>	Abd: I have faith, you'll do just fine ;)
00:47	<Darkside>	it could be a hardware problem ">
00:47	<Darkside>	:<
00:47	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: my "linksys" is open... im on my neighbors connection wich seems to work fine and its open as well
00:47	<Darknezz>	Jack_Sparrow: battery?
00:47	<Abd>	:D
00:47	<teamcobra>	I redid my first kernel when I was 13 ;) (11 years ago)
00:47	<mophead>	darkside, pelo: I'm running a toshiba a200 and mine did the same thing for a while
00:47	<d4t4min32>	but my "linksys" is open .. now wep
00:47	<josh04>	otarid: I had some trouble getting it to not use the VESA driver. Does it show Driver "intel" in xorg.conf?
00:47	<d4t4min32>	*no wep
00:47	<teamcobra>	and if I could do it then, you definitely can do it now
00:47	<mariorz>	mneptok: uhm i did? did you?
00:47	<Darkside>	mophead, did you solve it?
00:47	<Darknezz>	Jack_Sparrow: im running a PC not a laptop
00:47	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, tab completion error
00:48	<Genotrius>	Pelo: It's at the newest installed version.
00:48	<mophead>	Darkside: I think it sorta solved itself
00:48	<Pelo>	Darknezz, I think you need to install a packages called xmms2-gtk or somesuch, rigth now you only have  a command line xmms2
00:48	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz stick with apt-get bud
00:48	<Tristam>	josh04, it reports bcmwl5: driver installed
00:48	<mophead>	I have no idea how
00:48	<cegopaiva>	hi everyone
00:48	<mneptok>	mariorz: yes. and i also know what the distro team recommends. and that's apt-get.
00:48	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: did you see anythign that stuck out as being an issue
00:48	<Darkside>	thing is, its picking up the battery
00:48	<Pelo>	Darknezz, there is soemonee else with a nick close to yours we get confused, if you are told battery stuff ignore it
00:48	<Darkside>	and it was discharging from it
00:48	<mariorz>	mneptok: why? aptitude removes unneeded dependencies when removed
00:48	<Darkside>	but it can't charge it for some readon :<
00:48	<josh04>	Tristam: Are you sure that's the right driver? As in, have you used it before?
00:48	<doug2266778822>	would using someone elses codec files ruin my comp? if we both have same distro.
00:48	<mneptok>	mariorz: and so does apt-get
00:48	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, then its defintely the wpa supplicant causing the issue... might want to seek out wicd ... i would google it ... what i use, but it can have issues with compiz... or so i'm told
00:48	<r557>	anyone here use a freedns such as dyndns or another?
00:48	<Darknezz>	Pelo lol ok
00:48	<mariorz>	mneptok: and why did the write it if they dont want you to use it
00:48	<nibsa1242b>	I need help. Prior to upgrade to Hardy I enjoyed using Kate (in Gnome) as an editor. Since the upgrade if I try to open something in Kate nothing happens.
00:48	<Darknezz>	Pelo: kk
00:49	<Abd>	teamcobra each kernel I tried to compile went wrong, but at time i was suing suse 5.3
00:49	<Tristam>	josh04, I was using it in gutsy before I upgraded this morning
00:49	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz i think you missed the point of that blog
00:49	<Pelo>	nibsa1242b, sudo apt-get install kate
00:49	<mneptok>	mariorz: the distro team did not write aptitude
00:49	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: i dont follow
00:49	<Jack_Sparrow>	mariorz, our apt-get is virtually no different that aptitude.. not your average apt-get
00:49	<robeph>	doug2266778822: do what?
00:49	<Jack_Sparrow>	than'
00:49	<d4t4min32>	what is wpa supplicant
00:49	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, also daveyates at lottalinuxlinks recommends it over network manager ... another network manager wicd is
00:49	<robeph>	codec a la....?
00:49	<josh04>	Tristam: So it should work then. How are you connected at the moment?
00:49	<mariorz>	isnt aptitude ubuntu specific?
00:49	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: its already installed it just doesn't open when I click on it
00:49	<Pelo>	d4t4min32, encryption for wifi

00:50	<Darknezz>	Pelo: im trying to instal xmms2-gtk but its not working. i get this E: Couldn't find package xmms2-gtk
00:50	<robeph>	heh you know I've never used aptitude =\
00:50	<Pelo>	nibsa1242b, my guess is it is not , you only hve the link in the menu,  install it again
00:50	<madhamster>	problem: ubuntu fucks up xp when installing
00:50	<mariorz>	i see, and what is the reason for recomending apt-get?
00:50	<Sergiu9>	!codec
00:50	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also http://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/common-tasks-chap.html - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
00:50	<robeph>	I always use apt-get =s
00:50	<carl>	Hi, simple q i hope im trying to update via update manager am using my isp's mirror, its stoped at 394 of 1349 packages with a popup "please insert "ubuntu 8.04 - hardy herron"..... ive put in both the desktop and alternate cd it wont accept it i click cancel it comes straight back
00:50	<carl>	im thinking my mirror doesnt have all the packages
00:50	<robeph>	still confused as what he meant to someone elses codec and how this could hurt anything
00:50	<efrancolaporte>	so what do you guys think of ubuntu 8.04
00:50	<Pelo>	Darknezz, I'm not saying that's the package name,  check in synaptic,  search for xmms and see what is available
00:50	<RoAkSoAx>	after installing compizconfig-settings-manager, does anyone of you seen unchaged option ins System>Preferences>Appearance???
00:50	<mneptok>	mariorz: apt-get gets improvements written for it. like the ones that page you linked to describe. aptitude does not.
00:50	<robeph>	efrancolaporte: it's like ubuntu 8 beta =)... with less bugs
00:50	<astro76>	carl: go to system >	admin >	software sources, and uncheck the CD as a source
00:50	<thegattaca>	Simple question ... how does one install ubuntu on a system which only has 256 megs of ram? Tried xubuntu as well, no go ...

00:50	<mophead>	efrancolaporte: this is actuallyu just the support channel... see the topic

00:51	<robeph>	doug2266778822: theoretically you're not supposed to be able to play dvds I don't think
00:51	<carl>	gone
00:51	<madhamster>	it said on the ubuntu page that you should report bugs here, ubuntu fucks up xp if you install it the newest version
00:51	<otarid>	No josh04, it's not really showing any driver there (default screen, different monitor, etc.)
00:51	<norbi>	Hello, just wanted to stop by and say that I am liking Linux/Ubuntu so far.  First time user, everything so far went smooth.

00:52	<MattJ>	koomber1664: In System->Preferences->Appearance, disable Visual Effects, does it help?

00:54	<josh04>	Tristam: Ah, must have misread before. Are you sure you're blacklisting both the b43 driver and the ssb driver?
00:54	<MattJ>	magic_hat: Remove (or comment out the CD lines), and then sudo apt-get update
00:54	<magic_hat>	MattJ: waht am I looking for? never messed w/ that before.

00:54	<mophead>	d4t4min32: explain y our issue, including which version you are running, on what kind of machine, and which wireless care you're using.  that makes it easier to get a response here

00:55	<mophead>	d4t4min32: you could also try googling the name of your wifi driver and ubuntu and problem
00:55	<josh04>	Tristam: Try adding ohci_usb to the blacklist as well. It only runs legacy usb drivers AFAIK, so it shouldn't be a problem

01:00	<NetEcho>	ah
01:00	<moveax>	Odd-rationale: Hi. I tried gtk-recordmydesktop and it records it fine, but the colours are way out. They're very weird, in fact.
01:00	<ronartos>	josh04: so how to set things correctly?
01:00	<d4t4min32>	no
01:00	<Malachi>	Pelo: Thanks, will do.
01:00	<d4t4min32>	backlash: no
01:00	<happy_tux>	gravemind i am having problems using the alternative cd too.
01:00	<backlash>	because sudo has the same error
01:00	<moveax>	Odd-rationale: xvidcap just seg faults

01:01	<josh04>	ronartos: You'll have to edit your xorg.conf to set the driver to "intel", look for a tutorial. Can't promise anything though
01:01	<NetEcho>	carl thanks.. yea some guy I know is complaining about ubuntu and saying all this crap.. I've not had a single issue yet
01:01	<gravemind>	happy_tux: what's happening with yours? Mine starts ok, but the window stops responding
01:01	<Odd-rationale>	moveax: hmm. dunno. recordmydesktop has always worked for me...
01:01	<gravemind>	at the very first step
01:01	<NetEcho>	Pelo don't worry I can find them
01:01	<moveax>	Odd-rationale: do you use the commandline option?
01:01	<NetEcho>	I'm also ordering the cds
01:01	<happy_tux>	i select ubuntu install
01:01]  * Pelo is toying with gfxboot making a hardy theme menu for grub 
01:01	<Makgyver>	all
01:01	<popey>	moveax: recordmydesktop is good for recording a compiz-enabled desktop, xvidcap isnt
01:01	<carl>	NetEcho: no prob when you stick in the alternate cd you get a popup with an upgrade button
01:01	<happy_tux>	then kernel seems to load up
01:01	<Tristam>	josh04, still no luck  I'm going to start from scratch and see what happens
01:01	<mophead>	squish: afaik, just backup your data, wipe hardy and re-install gutsy online
01:01	<WhoNeedszzz>	How problematic is Hardy?
01:01	<Tristam>	back in a bit
01:01	<Odd-rationale>	moveax: no. I use the gtk or kde frontend
01:01	<happy_tux>	then nothing
01:01	<Pelo>	NetEcho, I'm just recommending the torrents over the website downloads,  easier on the servers
01:01	<Makgyver>	are there for any silly reason any PowerMac G4 users here
01:02	<d4t4min32>	backlash: you should see in hosts 127.0.0.1 bender and below that 127.0.0.1 bender.192.168.1.1
01:02	<Gun_Smoke>	WhoNeedszzz: I'm having none atm
01:02	<NetEcho>	ah thanks
01:02	<gravemind>	happy_tux: I'm using the alt cd to upgrade, not to install
01:02	<backlash>	d4t4min32, i even edited the 192.168.1.1 under the hosts tab to bender. no luck
01:02	<squish>	mophead: is all my data from /home ok to backup?
01:02	<koomber1664>	updated the graphics drivers worked
01:02	<Pelo>	Makgyver, we get a few , on occasion
01:02	<happy_tux>	ah ok
01:02	<josh04>	Tristam: Good luck. ssb is the one you need to make sure isn't loading, it claims the card away from ndiswrapper
01:02	<WhoNeedszzz>	Gun_Smoke: and how much stuff do u have?
01:02	<NetEcho>	carl chances are I'll do a complete fresh install since I don't have any important files under 7.10
01:02	<Makgyver>	I cannot for the life of me get the live CD to boot, I keep getting dropped into initfs
01:02	<moveax>	popey: well it records it fine, frame-rate wise, but not colour depth wise. It seems it's using a low colour depth, or a very odd colour palett
01:02	<WhoNeedszzz>	Gun_Smoke: big stuff that would have problems
01:02	<Tristam>	josh04, thanks for the assist
01:02	<josh04>	Tristam: It's in the dmesg you sent me
01:02	<mophead>	squish: I'm not sure what yoiu mean... /home is all your personal files e.g. downloads and stuff, so I would recommend backing that up
01:02	<backlash>	d4t4min32, i see 127.0.0.1 localhost and 127.0.1.1 bender

01:03	<WhoNeedszzz>	What are the problems that people are having with Hardy?
01:03	<mophead>	otarid: the wifi button doesn't light up anymore? that sounds suspicious
01:03	<Gun_Smoke>	WhoNeedszzz: Actually.. This is as promised.. Works "out of the box"
01:03	<mikebot>	I accidentally removed the tracker button from my panel, and I was wondering how I could re-add it..
01:03	<backlash>	d4t4min32, it gets changed to bender.bender for whatever reason

01:04	<josh04>	Tristam: Yeah, that's what I thought : / try lsmod|grep ssb and see what's relying on it
01:04	<otarid>	mophead: No, I don't think ubuntu is recognizing it anymore either. Bluetooth button works on the other hand

01:05	<d4t4min32>	i cant figure out my wifi errors, i dont see teh problem
01:05	<Gun_Smoke>	WhoNeedszzz: Only thing that I needed to get was the Nvidia driver which was in the repos for the restricted driver to "use" it.
01:05	<mophead>	so ask the question to the room again, but this time include the type of your computer, and the name of your wifi card
01:05	<josh04>	WhoNeedszzz: I keep getting people who have fuzzy audio which is fixed by changing the PCM slider in the mixer. Great fun :P
01:05	<gbosso>	gravemind: i thought mine was doing that the first stage took like 3-5min
01:05	<WhoNeedszzz>	Gun_Smoke: ick, i hate the restricted driver. I use the binary

01:28	<josh04>	nhuyanhuk: Command line tool for X. Used like: xrandr --output VGA --left-of LVDS
01:28	<Paddy_EIRE>	Yahuda: I would also highly recommend Smplayer
01:28	<Gun_Smoke>	n000b: Open up Add/Remove and search for nvidia.  Just get the binary for whatever card you have install that and restart.. Which card do you have?
01:28	<ng0n>	Rosh.  there is no fast way.  you just have to LEARN.

01:28	<pocketprotector2>	if i want .snapshots to appear in each users home directory, can i use rsnapshot? and if so, how? because i cant seem to get it to work. I see that the rsnapshot_root is set to /.snapshot/ and no_create_root is enabled. so is there anyway into tricking rsnapshot into thinking that the root is the directory in which its working?
01:28	<nhuyanhuk>	ï»¿josh04 : i am quite new to this ubuntu, i dont know that one though

01:32	<Orbixx>	I don't understand how this could suddenly happen.
01:32	<MattJ>	Orbixx: it's a PS/2 or USB keyboard?
01:32	<mehal88>	the files play fine in xp with mpc
01:32	<Pelo>	Roshane, it's a busy night,  just ask your question and hope to get noticed
01:32	<Orbixx>	USB.
01:32	<wrlinn>	my first experience with linux will be with hardy heron. am i missing out on some good eye candy by never using previous versions of ubuntu?
01:32	<otarid>	Sorry if I'm getting annoying but, where could I help with my wifi problem? (can't find anything similar on forum)
01:32	<SusanaFree21>	i want to do an dual boot

01:33	<Orbixx>	But... My point is. It happens without the keyboard plugged in.
01:33	<Orbixx>	MattJ: Webcam and mouse.
01:33	<Roshane>	thing is, i cant remember all the problems i had cause i'm not using ubuntu anymore

01:33	<MattJ>	Roshane: You might want to try the forums if IRC is not working for you
01:33	<Orbixx>	MattJ: No joy.
01:34	<Pelo>	Orbixx, usb ports are often grouped in pairs,  try putting your keyboard alone in a pair if you can
01:34	<josh04>	SusanaFree21: Does GRUB work at all?
01:34	<gluer>	roshane: why did u go back to xp?

01:42	<Abd>	teamcobra still here?
01:42	<Roshane>	remember i'm a new user, have no idea what you are talking about
01:42	<Skuller>	NDPMacBook: So porn filtering will need to be set up on each of the three PC's
01:42	<Orbixx>	MattJ: Nope, I might update to 8.04
01:42	<Juan>	astro76 how can i do it? cuz everytime i mount it next time i log in it is gone xD
01:42	<SusanaFree21>	good night
01:42	<Orbixx>	See if that helps.
01:42	<Pelo>	cardstroker, means you ran out of space on that partition , possibly on / ,  check and make some room,  empty your trash,  run  sudo apt-get autoclean , and try again
01:42	<IntangibleLiquid>	I cannot find Skype and Frostwire in synaptic
01:42	<Sindacious>	What would be safer, updatingto hardy via Update Manager, or formating and installing hardy?
01:42	<MattJ>	Orbixx: It's worth a try
01:43	<sartek>	i'm instaling hardy in vbox but it stuck on "preparing linux-image-*" for 30 mins any idea?

01:44	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about purge - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
01:44	<Pelo>	Roshane, just type my name at the begining of each line ,  it iwll highlight the text for me
01:44	<MattJ>	LainIwakura: It removes config files too
01:44	<Starnestommy>	LainIwakura: the latter removes all package names strting with "scim" and their config foles
01:44	<[LC]Neatchee>	LainIwakura, purge removes all configuration files, thatÅ the simple answer

01:46	<Pelo>	dassouki, here generaly,  open a terminal type  alsamixer put all the sliders up ,  ther are about 12 or 15 ,
01:46	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Well if you want performance on the desktop, you might want to look into using either fluxbox or XFCE as your desktop manager, rather than GNOME or KDE
01:46	<SeaPhor>	Starnestommy: Thanks!
01:46	<Pelo>	gravemind, what going on ?

01:48	<Pelo>	dassouki, that's all I have atm check in the forum there was someting about bypassing  pulseaudio ,  that migth help you
01:48	<gravemind>	Pelo: it's not actually a cd, I'm just mounting the image (which worked successfully 2 other cases
01:48	<cardstroker>	pelo, I ran apt-get autoclean, is that all I needed to do?
01:48	<MattJ>	jhow: Let us know the problem and we can do our best to help :)
01:48	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  is it faster than XP?
01:48	<darkcrab>	how do I make videolan media player the default for dvds?
01:48	<astro76>	Juan: links only work locally.. you need to do it in /etc/fstab, and obviously the network share would have to be connected to earlier in the boot process
01:48	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  in particular, web browsing
01:48	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  maybe I should try epiphany
01:48	<simmerz>	jhow: explain the problem. don't ask if you can ask. just ask
01:48	<gravemind>	Pelo, I wonder if I should report it as a bug
01:48	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Never tried XP on it, sorry, so i can't compare. It used to be 98 :P
01:49	<Roshane>	Pelo can i upgrade 7.04 to 8.04
01:49	<gluer>	Q: how do i turn off ip6??
01:49	<astro76>	Juan: also you would want that share to support Linux file permissions, so that means no samba
01:49	<Pelo>	cardstroker,  in terminal  gksu nautilus /var/cache/apt   delete .deb file in there that you don'T know you need
01:49	<dassouki>	pelo,  is it odd that both are decice zereo http://pastebin.com/m70313777

01:54	<gravemind>	jrabbit: but it's an easy fix

01:56	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  maybe this is as fast as it's supposed to be, too bad there isn't a benchmark I could use to test it
01:56	<Pelo>	cardstroker, did you make a seperate partiton for your /  ?
01:56	<Millertime_018>	hey every automated download that i've tried is failing!
01:56	<ToM-X>	Hey, does anyone know how to get Kicker fully working on ubuntu?
01:56	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  the other thing is, the cpu utilization of firefox...I remember it being less in XP
01:56	<Al-Khouli>	hi guys, is there a risk in changing sources.list to have gutsy words replaced with hardy then do an upgrade ?!
01:56	<Flannel>	Millertime_018: How is it failing?  and what automated download stuff?
01:56	<nith>	Flannel: thx, I must not have updated my sources file yet. I was kinda hoping it'd be e17
01:57	<Skuller>	genii: thanks. Sorry to not have found this myself.
01:57	<NDPMacBook>	Skuller: Then you are pretty much out of luck if you can't get dansgaurdian running.
01:57	<Flannel>	nith: e17 isn't out yet
01:57	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  even when I'm not doing anything on firefox, it using resources, sometimes a lot
01:57	<genii>	Skuller: np
01:57	<Roshane>	what about softwares that i normally use in windows, can i get those to run on ubuntu?
01:57	<Pelo>	Millertime_018,  download of what ?
01:57	<thinkingfrog>	I should install epiphany, I'll do that now
01:57	<chaqu1>	simonft2 it says that x server doest not support XrandR
01:57	<Millertime_018>	my update still doesnt work at all and now my add/remove app wont quit failing on app downloads!
01:57	<Pelo>	Al-Khouli, yes there is , don' tdo that
01:57	<Flannel>	Al-Khouli: It's doable yes, just make sure you have all the proper metapackages, or just let update-manager do it for you.
01:57	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: don't trust the stats ;) Ubuntu's task manager and XP's task manager record things in entirely different ways
01:57	<Skuller>	NDPMacBook: Hmm. I'll just try a bit more luck with dansguardian then.:)

01:58	<jrabbit>	gravemind: It didn't do anything
01:58	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  it's just not as responsive
01:58	<nith>	Flannel: granted but before upgrading I was using it daily... and it was excellent. A pitty it's still 'alpha'
01:58	<Al-Khouli>	Flannel, i am not able to use update-manager

01:58	<jrabbit>	gravemind: no prompts
01:58	<bagelong>	Why does restricted drivers say I have no restricted drivers when my wireless card needs them?
01:58	<Flannel>	Al-Khouli: why not?
01:58	<Roshane>	what about softwares that i normally use in windows, can i get those to run on ubuntu?
01:58	<Pelo>	cardstroker, was this an empty hdd before you tried to isntall ?
01:58	<IndyGunFreak>	bagelong: probably because there's not a restricted driver available?
01:58	<Al-Khouli>	Flannel, i keep getting an "Authenticating upgrade failed" msg
01:58	<jrabbit>	gravemind: nothing but a warning its overwriting a "custom config"
01:58	<howapt>	Does anyone know where the login settings are stored? Since upgrading I now have to log in twice...
01:58	<Gun_Smoke>	This probably answers itself.. But if the 64bit install is up and running, is there a possibility that I'm only running at 32?
01:58	<Flannel>	Al-Khouli: Whats the actual error?
01:58	<acoustyk>	after installing hardy is there anything I need to install to get compiz working?  I want to enable the cube.
01:58	<ToM-X>	 Hey, does anyone know how to get Kicker fully working on ubuntu?
01:58	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  I was wondering if there were options in xorg.conf...maybe it's just gnome
01:58	<Millertime_018>	the alternate install cd? i got 8.04 straight from ubuntu.com though
01:58	<fraserdp>	I have a aironet wireless and its restricted driver doesn't show up.  wireless has worked on every other release
01:58	<gravemind>	jrabbit: did you do it in the terminal, or the virtual terminal
01:58	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Does compiz work for you?
01:58	<IndyGunFreak>	!alternate | Millertime_018
01:58	<ubotu>	Millertime_018: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
01:58	<bagelong>	the ubuntu support says there are drivers included with the intall.
01:58	<jrabbit>	gravemind:TTY4 virtual
01:58	<astro76>	Gun_Smoke: no
01:59	<Roshane>	what about softwares that i normally use in windows, can i get those to run on ubuntu?
01:59	<Al-Khouli>	Flannel, just a moment
01:59	<fraserdp>	the drivers are included
01:59	<ToM-X>	 Hey, does anyone know how to get Kicker fully working on ubuntu?
01:59	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  gnome is less responsive than it was when I installed Debian 6 many moons ago on a slower machine
01:59	<fraserdp>	i can see the device, but it wont enable or anything
01:59	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  I haven't tried installing it
01:59	<howapt>	Does anyone know where the login settings are stored? Since upgrading I now have to log in twice...
01:59	<jrabbit>	Not even a driver is mentioned, gravemind
01:59	<chaqu1>	compiz worked from the box for me
01:59	<gravemind>	jrabbit: could you pastebin the output?
01:59	<koomber1664>	I'm real sorry for the stupid questions, but I'm totally new to Linux and Ubuntu.  I've downloaded something from synaptic.  where can I find it?
01:59	<Pelo>	Roshane,  you'll get linux alternatives to do the same job
01:59	<thinkingfrog>	chaqul:  what video card?
01:59	<Flannel>	Roshane: depending on what they are, yes.  But you're better off finding comperable programs that are native, and using those instead.
01:59	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Do you have compiz enabled/does it work if you do?
01:59	<jrabbit>	gravemind: It doesn't out put anything
01:59	<Gun_Smoke>	astro76: Is there a way for me to "see" something say 64bit?
01:59	<jrabbit>	and no
01:59	<Pelo>	koomber1664, it' already installed, check in the menus
01:59	<gravemind>	jrabbit: what happens when you run the command then?
01:59	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  haven't even tried.  where do I enable it?  administration?
01:59	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: It's default with gutsy. It's in the last tab on appearance
01:59	<fraserdp>	koomber1664: it is automatically installed
01:59	<astro76>	Gun_Smoke: uname -a

02:00	<Gun_Smoke>	astro76: Got it with uname-a
02:00	<Millertime_018>	well what will the alternate install do?
02:00	<Juan>	astro76 how?
02:00	<Gun_Smoke>	astro76:  Thanks.
02:00	<howapt>	Does anyone know where the login settings are stored? Since upgrading I now have to log in twice...
02:00	<chaqu1>	i forget how to get the specific model
02:00	<Pelo>	koomber1664, if you are new to linux just use  Add/remove for no , leave synaptic alone , add/remove does apps,

02:02	<fraserdp>	Does anyone know how to get wireless to work with 8.04 for cisco aironet card.  When i do lshw -C network it does show the card, but iwconfig says no wireless extensions and doesnt show the [eth1] for the wireless card

02:07	<CITguy>	cardstroker: have you tried "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"?
02:07	<josh04>	gravemind: I think it's an issue, not a feature. At least, I'd hope :P I posted in the bug report aobut it a few days ago
02:07	<cardstroker>	pelo, will do
02:07	<aboo0ood_>	Flannel, Authentication failed Authenticating the upgrade failed. There may be a problem with the network or with the server.

02:08	<Pelo>	josh04, I know it's annoying,  we are linux users damit , we can not afraid of command lines or of being prompted for answers
02:09	<aboo0ood_>	Flannel, that's why i was thinking of changing sources.list manually
02:09	<IndyGunFreak>	acoustyk: right click desktop, change desktop preferences, visual effects tab.
02:09	<aboo0ood_>	Flannel, what do u think ?
02:09	<nith>	acoustyk: system ->	preferences ->	appearence ->	visual effects
02:09	<Pingviller_>	ok I have a really wierd program since I updated ubuntu a few days ago... when I delete files, they just vanish. and they don't free up space and they're not to be found in trashcan... every program that was meant for KDE also stopped working..
02:09	<bagelong>	Has anyone successfully gotten an unrecognized wireless card going?
02:09	<Pingviller_>	not sure what to do really, but my harddrive is kinda full and I need the space :P
02:09	<comerc>	does hardy come with compiz or compiz fusion ?
02:09	<jrabbit>	gravemind: it didn't ask for ANYTHING related to resolution or monitor, I chose no FB

02:09	<chaqu1>	nith i believe she wants to turn the cube on, which she'll need to go to the advanced tab for
02:09	<lesjohn>	my media playback in firefox (mplayer) isn't working well.  youtube sound is bad and .ra files play jerkily.  this stuff worked in gutsy.  are tehre any preferences i can change to help this out?
02:09	<jrabbit>	gravemind: it also left that overwrite warning but thats expected
02:09	<ommegang>	does virtulbox work under hardy?
02:10	<Juan>	astro76 just before i leave, there is no way that ubuntu can read a user profile of windows server correct?
02:10	<oddalot>	bagelong: what do you mean by unrecognized?
02:10	<Flannel>	aboo0ood_: Changing sources.list won't help, it still connects to the same servers, and through the same libraries.  Try a different mirror (software sources).  You do need to remember that a *lot* of people are trying to get stuff from the mirrors right now, so it is completely possible that its just too slow
02:10	<nith>	Pingviller_: I just solved a problem with those symptoms about 15 minutes ago... do "df" and see if the drive your home is on is full
02:10	<josh04>	Pelo: Exactly! This GUI nonsense is just weakness of character :P
02:10	<acoustyk>	nith:  It says that the effects couldn't be enabled.  I have a radeon x300 128mb graphics card and this stuff worked in gutsy
02:10	<nith>	and I'm being kicked off
02:10	<cardstroker>	CITguy, "No Xserver known for your video hardware."
02:10	<nomasteryoda>	comerc, i'll advise installing the fusion-icon too... =D
02:10	<gravemind>	jrabbit: josh04 says this is a new bug (?) with the xserver-xorg thing
02:10]  * nith waves ; cheers
02:10	<comerc>	what do you mean?
02:10	<prakriti>	I just upgraded, how do I get my nvidia driver installed?
02:10	<Skuller>	My Automatix is currently running and downloading javaRE, but it is very slow. And no it is not a connection limitation I am sure. Could it be the server is slow?
02:10	<aboo0ood_>	Flannel, i c
02:10	<aboo0ood_>	thanx
02:10	<prakriti>	should I compile for source?
02:10	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, there is a bit of a bug , they moved the .Trash to  ~/.local/share/Thrash ,   some apps seem to not have notices,  goto   ~/.Trash that's where you old trash is , you can shift del the files from there , come back after and I,ll give you a trick to fix the issue
02:10	<jrabbit>	josh04: would jsut hacking it together work?
02:10	<nucco>	Flannel: I think there's enough bandwidth if you choose your mirrors wisely.
02:10	<astro76>	Juan: if you share it in windows you can access the files
02:11	<nomasteryoda>	comerc, its a tray package that lets you switch from one window decoration type... say kwin, metacity, ... compiz
02:11	<CITguy>	cardstroker: how have you installed Ubuntu?
02:11	<Flannel>	nucco: Hense the suggestion to try a different mirror
02:11	<bagelong>	oddalog:  I have installed 8.04 on a brand new dell vostro.  The wireless card has no driver assigned and I cannot seem to find a way to do so.
02:11	<howapt>	Pelo: That trick to fix said issue with .Trash being moved, can I have it too???
02:11	<josh04>	jrabbit: Writing xorg.conf by hand? Sure, i think
02:11	<comerc>	ahh where can i get that?
02:11	<K3rmit-D-Frog>	Hi, anyone familiar with installing UbuntuStudio using Wubi? I remember doing this in 7.x, but I don't see any options in the new Wubi interface.

02:11	<oddalot>	bagelong: it's a built in wireless card?
02:11	<nomasteryoda>	comerc, also install the advanced compiz manager (ccsm) ... to get more ways to tweak it
02:11	<jrabbit>	josh04:  actually is there a proper one up anywhere?
02:11	<bagelong>	yes.  minipci
02:12	<cardstroker>	CITguy, from a server ISO that I downloaded and burned, installation went fine untill I tried to install the gui.
02:12	<otarid>	I couldn't find any working solution on forum, I have a problem getting wifi to work on intel 3945 card (it doesn't work at all)
02:12	<gooody>	any recommended offline dictionary for ubuntu gutsy?
02:12	<Pelo>	howapt, first ok hold on , I'm right a full script for it
02:12	<Pingviller_>	nith: df says drive is basicalyl full yes
02:12	<nucco>	if you're trying to download, pick a close mirror with decent bandwidth from here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors
02:12	<milkn>	Hi guys. I'm trying to find a fix for my wireless connection. I just installed Hardy and the b-fw cutter downloaded and installed a firmware for my broadcom card. however i seem to be limited to 1Mb/s. I was using it at 48Mb/s before hardy. any pointers?
02:12	<nomasteryoda>	what a full channel...
02:12	<jhow>	Someone can say me why the BusyBox is appearing on the installation of Ubuntu 8.04 when i start the LiveCD with the first option.
02:12	<oddalot>	bagelong: the ndiswrapper thing doesn't work?
02:12	<josh04>	jrabbit: A proper xorg.conf? Probably not, unless you can find one for your specific machine : /
02:12	<Pelo>	howapt, not a script just a complete command for the terminal
02:12	<mehal88>	i need help editing my grub loader. i have 4 linux entries(2 normal and 2 safe mode) and one xp, currently the linux 16 is default, i want xp to be default and only the newest linux (16) + safe mode to show

02:12	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about process - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
02:12	<CITguy>	cardstroker: try "sudo tasksel" and choose "gnome-desktop"

02:12	<comerc>	nomaster yoda, how would i go about aquiring that and installing it?
02:12	<howapt>	Pelo: cheers :)
02:13	<nomasteryoda>	mehal88, if you move the xp entries above the linux lines... you'll get it to be default
02:13	<Skuller>	How do I quit Automatix, it is downloading jre but is very slow. I need to kill the process
02:13	<bagelong>	oddalot: It keeps telling me that the driver provided by dell is invalid.  I have also tried going through the restricted driver utility.
02:13	<astro76>	mehal88: you should uninstall the old kernels to get rid of the entries if you want
02:13	<gravemind>	!automatix
02:13	<ubotu>	Automatix is no longer developed or supported by its creators and is not recommended, supported or needed by Ubuntu. See http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html and Â« /msg ubotu WorksForMe Â»
02:13	<Flannel>	mehal88: After the xp one (before the chainloader +1) add a line "savedefault", then instead of "default 0" make it (this is up near the top) `default saved`
02:13	<CITguy>	cardstroker: sorry, "Ubuntu desktop"
02:13	<Pelo>	howapt, Pingviller_    sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash && ln -s ~/.local/share/Trash/files
02:13	<josh04>	jrabbit: See if you've got an older version of xorg.conf from gutsy or something which you can copy the graphics card section out of
02:13	<gravemind>	Skuller:  you could use the force quit thing
02:13	<oddalot>	bagelong: don't know then sorry :(
02:13	<koomber1664>	I've seen some cool videos on youtube of the workspaces on linux being arrange like a cube.  How would I find stuff like that?
02:13	<jrabbit>	josh04: nope XD wiped that sucker
02:13	<jhow>	Someone can say me why the BusyBox is appearing on the installation of Ubuntu 8.04 when i start the LiveCD with the first option.
02:14	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: my ~/home/.local/ only has one directory... "share"
02:14	<nomasteryoda>	comerc, sudo apt-get install fusion-icon ccsm
02:14	<gravemind>	right click on the top panel, click add to panel, find the force quit thing
02:14	<comerc>	koomber that is already with linux
02:14	<josh04>	jrabbit: What card do you have :P
02:14	<Skuller>	gravemind: How?
02:14	<Pelo>	howapt, Pingviller_    sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash && ln -s ~/.local/share/Trash/files
02:14	<gravemind>	Skuller: then use it

02:14	<gravemind>	Skuller: right click on the top panel, click add to panel, find the force quit thing
02:14	<comerc>	nomaster yoday is that a command line?
02:14	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, just run that command
02:14	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: I also tried searching for the files throughout the harddrive with no success
02:14	<luser>	When I go to Update Manager, there is no Upgrade to 8.04 option, even after using the Check button. Currently running 7.10
02:14	<jrabbit>	Awww
02:14	<fraserdp>	My wireless card wont work, it shows under sudo lshw -C network, but wont enable or anything. i think this is because it should show in restriced drivers.  I have a cisco aironet
02:14	<Wrec>	can someone help me install a 'paintchat' application? the 'readme' is in japanese ><
02:14	<jrabbit>	josh04: when i edited and restarted its not an option in the gnome utility to switch >:(
02:14	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: ok I hope it doesn't delete everything useful :P
02:15	<otarid>	any solution to this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/178530 ?
02:15	<Pelo>	howapt, it will remove your old .Trash,  and make a symlink to the new location so that app that try to reomve to the old one will get redirected to the new one
02:15	<Flannel>	luser: do you have gutsy-updates enabled?
02:15	<nomasteryoda>	comerc, actually... ccsm is the shortname... sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
02:15	<mr_smithers>	anyone know why http://us.archive.ubuntu.com takes song to start downloading something?
02:15	<nomasteryoda>	for full control
02:15	<jrabbit>	josh04: I'm looking at the conf in /etc/X11/ it isn't refrencing some other one is it?

02:15	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, it won't break anyting, it just empties your trash and make a link

02:15	<CITguy>	mr_smithers: because, everybody's trying to use it at once
02:15	<luser>	Flannel, yes i do
02:15	<OxDeadC0de>	ï»¿koomber1664:  look for  compiz-fusion & ccsm
02:15	<nucco>	mr_smithers: replace 'us' with 'nl' just for kicks ;)
02:15	<josh04>	jrabbit: Nope. Hardy just leaves a bare-bones xorg.conf there and tried to guess it all
02:15	<dabbill>	when i try to play DVD's they have a blue tint to them. Any one know how to fix them or where i can look for a fix?
02:16	<astro76>	DrDerek: no
02:16	<mr_smithers>	ah i figured as much thanks
02:16	<Pelo>	howapt, I had this issue during beta that' how I'M setup now ,  the gui search still treis to delete to the old trash

02:16	<Vertelemming>	Two post-upgrade questions... one, is it normal for hda1 to have become sda1, shoving my SATA drives down? Two, new window behaviour seems to be off. New windows are appearing below the topmost window, instead of above it and taking the focus. Any ideas on that one?
02:16	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: it worked :) at least the space is back :) thanks ;) what do you mean with link btw? I'm kinda new to ubuntu and havn't learned that much yet
02:16	<gooody>	anybody here can recommend an offline dictionary for ubuntu gutsy?
02:16]  * Pelo is now seeding  the dvd , the live cd and the alt-cd
02:16	<CITguy>	nek0: stop sending junk
02:16	<supersako>	whats the best bittorrent client for ubuntu?
02:16	<luser>	Maybe the repositories are overloaded, I'm seeing some "Failed" when downloading package information, not sure which ones matter
02:16	<Flannel>	Vertelemming: It's normal for hda to become sdX, the order depends on your BIOS, and that's why we moved to UUIDs instead of /dev/*
02:16	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, like a shortcut in windows, but so much more
02:17]  * gravemind wonders how much bandwidth pelo has
02:17	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, open a terminal and type   man ln
02:17	<josh04>	supersako: either transmission or rtorrent. or utorrent in wine :P
02:17	<nucco>	gooody: the default one is good. just install the "dictd" packages and recommends
02:17	<CITguy>	supersako: 8.04 has Transmission, but you can use any bittorrent client you want
02:17	<Vertelemming>	Flannel: Danke.
02:17	<IntangibleLiquid>	my desktop cube looks like a paper, not a cube. Why?
02:17	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: cool, I'll read a bit ;)
02:17	<astro76>	Vertelemming: first question... yes, ubuntu has been using libata for sometime, I guess now the upgrade is finally converting old installs
02:17	<Pelo>	gravemind, not nearly enough   80 kps out and rigth now i'm only doing 50
02:17	<howapt>	Pelo: Ah kk, its taking a while... but this comp is a rubbish hand-me-down, Ill wait it out
02:17	<otarid>	Man, no help on forum, no help on IRC, no help in help file... wireless used to work out of the box in 7.10 ; ;
02:17	<nucco>	gooody: and then configure it to use the local dictionary server
02:17	<gooody>	nucco: ok, thanks.
02:17	<supersako>	great thanks
02:17	<gotenks>	IntangibleLiquid - you have to make sure there are 4 Desktops for it to become a cube
02:18	<GuDoN>	Hey there

02:18	<prakriti>	my restricted drivers manager is gone
02:18	<gravemind>	Pelo: heh it beats 30 out :)
02:18	<Pelo>	howapt, it shouldn't take that long unless you have alot of files in your old ~/.Trash
02:18	<jeeves__>	ha anyone here figured out why the toshiba P100 will play sound through the speakers, but not through the headphones?
02:18	<MattJ>	IntangibleLiquid: System->Preferences->Appearance->Visual Effects
02:18	<prakriti>	do i need to install nvidia myself?
02:18	<gravemind>	Pelo: but when I'm at university, I get more haha
02:18	<bagelong>	pelo:  not that your doing anything, but you seem to be the man.  Any help for a noob with a wireless card that lies dormant.

02:18	<fraserdp>	My wireless card wont work, it shows under sudo lshw -C network, but wont enable or anything. i think this is because it should show in restriced drivers.  I have a cisco aironet.  Anyone know how to make this work?

02:18	<dassouki>	is there a way to reinstall the kernel

02:19	<howapt>	Pelo: Nah, I think its due to some other issues im having... I keep getting "unable to resolve host" on sudo (despite it still sudoing), and also a sendmail: fatal: issue popping up when I sudo! might do a clean inst. of hardy
02:19	<CITguy>	hazza: how did you install the driver?
02:19	<binskipy2u>	ok peoples, just wondering how do you "remaster" "mklivecd" or spin your own Ubuntu?

02:21	<Pelo>	bagelong, you card is detected ?
02:21	<fraserdp>	My wireless card wont work, it shows under sudo lshw -C network, but wont enable or anything. i think this is because it should show in restriced drivers.  I have a cisco aironet.  Anyone know how to make this work?
02:21	<dassouki>	jeeves__, my sound was working perfectly on 7.10 until i upgraded
02:21	<Vertelemming>	Any ideas on why new windows aren't taking the focus, and are appearing beneath the topmost window?

02:23	<josh04>	gravemind: I have a shortlist of problems since last december which refuse to budge an inch :P
02:23	<SeaPhor>	josh04: right now i'm on the 8.04 live cd because for the past 4 months i have not been able to get wireless working, no matter what walkthu i went to or this site or that,,, so just now i put in the live cd and thats where i am, was hoping 8.04 would just work but oh well
02:23	<dabbill>	nucco, where do i do that at?
02:23	<Daisuke_Ido>	mehal88, kernal images aren't that big, but if you have to, just uninstall the corresponding package in synaptic
02:23	<nucco>	dabbill: its probably a gamma setting, but I don't know where to fix that
02:23	<AstralSin>	how can i make aptitude create the menu.lst for grub? i screwed up and said no when it asked me to replace it

02:23	<bagelong>	pelo:  nothing shows up in restricted drivers, although this seems to be the the most logical solution.
02:23	<Pelo>	mehal88, go in syanptic in the admin menu , search for linux and check the appropriate packages for removal
02:23	<nullbnx>	ok, so i just updated to 8.04 and now amarok keeps crashing over and over again... any recommendations?
02:23	<mad_max02>	yeah
02:23	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Wireless on the LiveCD was always shaky for me. Try installing to a small partition and seeing if it works
02:23	<mad_max02>	dont update :D

02:24	<jeeves__>	dassouki, if I open a new window, the menu buttons and the menu items (ie. file, view, etc) will have a back bar over them.  I think it's somehow related to my random freezing problem
02:24	<gravemind>	josh04: I had one like that, feisty broke my cd drive, it has never been fixed since
02:24	<AlienX>	AstralSin, just use the menu.lst file as a template for the latest kernel
02:24	<AlienX>	AstralSin, you just need to change the file names of the kernels to the latest ubuntu kernel

02:24	<isdepopecath>	Pelo: (I was the newbie trying to access my vista partition) I installed the NFTS Configuration Tool, but it isn't recognizing any more partitions, unless I don't know where to go to see that. Any ideas?
02:24	<Pelo>	mehal88, it's your old kernel,  it's there incase there is a problem with the new one so you can boot the old one and fix the issue  if it works fine you can remove them from synaptic
02:24	<AstralSin>	AlienX: what about the root=UUID=bb3d2b7e-c64c-4f1b-8efd-b0361af81208 garbage?

02:25	<ruewan>	ok

02:27	<gravemind>	josh04: you might just have to give up the luxury of hibernate, unless it's really important to you
02:27	<CITguy>	hazza: the only thing i can suggest is installing the driver straight from NVIDIA
02:27	<jeeves__>	dassouki, how'd you guess?
02:27	<Pelo>	bagelong, ok it is likely that there is not linux driver for your card,  so you will have to use the windows driver with ndiswrapper,   that,s mentionned in the wifi docs
02:27	<hazza>	AlienX: What do I change?
02:27	<gravemind>	I never really liked hibernate in ubuntu anyway, regular boot is just as fast for me
02:27	<isdepopecath>	Pelo: It shows 'Computer,' but if I go into that, it only shows up with my dvd drive and 'File System'
02:27	<AlienX>	hazza, the default resolution :) read the file, and you should be able to figure it out :)
02:28	<dassouki>	jeeves__,  i used to get black screen flashes on nvidia. the driver takes some googling to get it to work, but once it does, it's a beauty
02:28	<bagelong>	pelo:  how can I get the most information about my card in the terminal - what command do i need?
02:28	<KooperKool>	:-D
02:28	<Pelo>	isdepopecath, right click , mount ,  see if they show up on your desktop
02:28	<[>	:D
02:28	<AlienX>	bagelong, what kind of card?
02:28	<josh04>	gravemind: Hibernate's useful because I dual boot and have to swap between the two a lot. I can hibernate both ubuntu and vista and never have to open firefox again :P
02:28	<fraserdp>	bagelong: sudo lshw -C network
02:28	<hazza>	AlienX: So they didn't test it enough and we have to hand edit, great
02:28	<gravemind>	josh04: ah that's a good point
02:28	<jeeves__>	dassouki, any recomended pages?
02:28	<bagelong>	alienx: broadband minipc

02:28	<SeaPhor>	josh04: well, if i boot back into my gutsy, could you help me make that work? I'm happy with 7.10 and not ready to change unless it gets wireless working, i have 8.04 on my laptop
02:28	<AlienX>	bagelong, lspci

02:29	<josh04>	SeaPhor: I could try, no promises though

02:29	<Darknezz>	 im getting this error when compiling: configure: error: *** GTK+ >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first ***
02:29	<mehal88>	pelo: do i still delete the entries from my menu.lst file or will they go away by themselves?
02:29	<AlienX>	bagelong, what specifically are you looking for?
02:29	<Kineas>	hi
02:29	<Pelo>	bagelong, lspci should list your card,  get the number and such,  ndiswrapper you can install from synaptic,   ndiswrapper-config as well or -utils , i donT' recall,   and you'll need the .inf file ffrom the card's installation cd
02:29	<josh04>	gravemind: It'd be okay if sleep worked, but that hangs on resume the _second_ time I do it : / obscure errors ftw
02:29	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: is libgtk-2.0-dev or libgtk-1.2-dev installed?
02:29	<AlienX>	MoTec, most netgear or linksys ones will work with ndiswrapper
02:29	<bagelong>	fraserdp: i tried that, but nothing happened, is there a slash
02:29	<jeeves__>	lol, I don't have that much time.  I'm a network admin with a rack of DR boxes that I FINALY got built this week, and they ALL need OSes loaded and configured on them.
02:29	<amenado>	MoTec usb and gigabit? you do know that USB doesn even come close to giga bit speed eh?
02:29	<SeaPhor>	josh04: lol, ok, all i ask is that  you try ;-))

02:29	<rkvirani>	hey all

02:29	<josh04>	gravemind: and of course there's no way to debug sleep
02:29	<Pelo>	mehal88, they should go away but if they don't you can remove the manualy afterward
02:30	<rkvirani>	so tell me, this bug, where the drop shadow on my window is PINK, how do I fix it?
02:30	<SeaPhor>	josh04: loggin back to 7.10
02:30	<dassouki>	jeeves__, ya that's the thing with linux, once it runs it's perfect, a lot easier to maintain than ms

02:42	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: sorry i closed irc befor
02:42	<mayakuza>	i need some help hvit partisjons can someone help me?
02:42	<rkvirani>	anyone here use irssi?
02:42	<AlienX>	Wolf23, what was the output?
02:42	<mohamed_>	which flash plugin is better for FF ?
02:42	<cardstroker>	rkvirani, I chose VESA, went all through the setup and now I cannot go into gui mode because I get FontPath could not be found error.
02:42	<Limerick>	Regard the computer as idle after 1 minute, Activate screensaver when computer is idle, Lock screen when screensaver is active all set
02:42	<josh04>	rkvirani: Not well, why :P
02:42	<comerc>	nucco did you see the last msg... the live CD has a countdown next to it, which counts down from 30 seconds and then i guess automatically selects englush... however the text installer doesnt do that
02:42	<bagelong>	josh04:  I hate to be stupid, but do i return between them?
02:42	<Limerick>	Using the Pictures folder screensaver
02:42	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
02:42	<mayakuza>	i need some help hvit partisjons can someone help me?
02:42	<rkvirani>	bleh
02:42	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  i think 800X600
02:42	<rkvirani>	cardstroker: hrm really
02:42	<josh04>	bagelong: Yes, so they're on two seperate lines
02:42	<rkvirani>	I think you messed up your config
02:42	<gravemind>	mayakuza: if it's not too hard, I can help :)
02:42	<otarid>	oh hey
02:42	<cardstroker>	CITguy, thank you, I'll provide more info if necessary.
02:43	<rkvirani>	run  -configure
02:43	<Wilo>	How do i set up a external usb hard drive to be the first priority to boot for ubuntu 8.04
02:43	<CITguy>	cardstroker: try "sudo apt-get install xfonts-100dpi-transcoded xfonts-75dpi-transcoded"
02:43	<Pelo>	isdepopecath, patience,  the servers very loaded , might take a few minutes to dl and install , the command i gave you will open the app automaticaly when it is installed
02:43	<nucco>	comerc: yes, with the text installer, you have to choose manually. easiest way out is to borrow a ps/2 keyboard
02:43	<mayakuza>	gravemind: can i pm you? to menny ppl are talking here hehe
02:43	<AlienX>	Wolf23, no...i meant which nvidia card are you using? Go to http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html and follow the instructions
02:43	<comerc>	ahh
02:43	<Limerick>	bjb, does it just sit there with a blank screen?
02:43	<bagelong>	josh04:  I have added them.  Does there need to be a double space between them or anything?
02:43	<Crshman>	did hardy lose support for dual screens? I can't find the tool to use dual screens anymore
02:43	<comerc>	thanks
02:43	<isdepopecath>	Pelo: Thanks so much!
02:43	<Limerick>	<Crshman>	did hardy lose support for dual screens? I can't find the tool to use dual screens anymore
02:43	<Limerick>	Definitely not
02:43	<gravemind>	mayakuza: sure
02:43	<PhilcoBill>	what is the command that is the same as windows chldsk?
02:43	<nucco>	comerc: besides, if the live cd is having trouble booting, chances are the installed system will present you with the same problems... unless you're sure they're fixable
02:43	<biabia>	bazhang: -2.6.24-16-g
02:43	<josh04>	bagelong: nope, just exactly as they are between the quotes: "blacklist ssb"
02:43	<Starnestommy>	PhilcoBill: fsck
02:43	<PhilcoBill>	er chkdsk
02:43	<Zaqq>	hi. i installed Heron using WUBI ... added some new software including kde apps, nvidia driver etc .. now after the reboot .. the ubuntu logo shows up and in a couple of seconds i get a terminal screen with (initramfs) ... and it awaits input. what can i do now?
02:43	<otarid>	about the wireless problem with intel 3945... picking the Ubuntu 8.04, kernel 2.6.24-14-generic options instead of -16 fixes it
02:44	<Limerick>	One of their new features has something to do with dual screens
02:44	<otarid>	so i guess it's a kernel problem
02:44	<Wolf23>	AlienX: how can i know?
02:44	<Flannel>	Zaqq: what sort of input?
02:44	<gravemind>	lol
02:44	<Pelo>	isdepopecath, no promisses yet,    M$ does not play well with others and Vista is their latest attempt at bullying other OSes from the computers,  might not work
02:44	<CITguy>	cardstroker: or "sudo apt-get install xfonts* "
02:44	<Limerick>	I don't have dual screens set up, so, I'm not sure exactly how they work
02:44	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
02:44	<Limerick>	But they're definitely still there
02:44	<bagelong>	josh04: ok.  Do I save now?
02:44	<AlienX>	Wolf23, just download, install, and run envy...it'll make your life easier
02:44	<isdepopecath>	Pelo: Ok, no worries.
02:44	<josh04>	bagelong: yes
02:44	<evilbug>	how can i enable restricted drivers via command line
02:44	<Zaqq>	Flannel: like a dos screen ... with the terminal prompt as (initramfs)
02:44	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i cant find it, i did dmesg /home/dmesg
02:44	<bazhang>	biabia: that is the normal hardy kernel; by saying newest many might think (newest from kernel org, compiled yourself) what is your exact issue?
02:44	<LainIwakura>	Hello, what should I do if after installing an xfonts .deb package and enabling bitmapped fonts using "sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config" and a restart, the fonts do not show up anywhere? Strangely, I can see them in "xfontsel". The package is xfonts-artwiz. Thanks.
02:44	<Assid>	AlienX: envy ?
02:44	<evand>	Zaqq: try running a chkdsk /f /r in windows, and if that doesn't work file a bug at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug.
02:45	<Pelo>	evilbug, good quesiton
02:45	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  ok
02:45	<AlienX>	Assid, http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
02:45	<Starnestommy>	AlienX: we do not support envy
02:45	<Pelo>	!restricted-drivers
02:45	<SeaPhor>	josh04, no, i did dmesg /home/dmesg.txt
02:45	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Use the less than symbol: dmesg >	file.name
02:45	<AlienX>	Starnestommy, i don't particularly care :)
02:45	<Zaqq>	evand: so do i need to reinstall ?
02:45	<bazhang>	Starnestommy: not for gutsy, but is in repos for hardy
02:45	<evand>	Zaqq: when you get to that initramfs prompt you can type `cat /casper.log` and shift page up through it, look for anything that resembles a serious error.
02:45	<evilbug>	Pelo- :O  =P
02:45	<evand>	Zaqq: not necessarily
02:45	<Assid>	AlienX: aah okay.. but the drivers seem pretty updated already arent they
02:45	<gravemind>	mayakuza: I'm not getting any pms
02:45	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
02:45	<Pelo>	evilbug, try sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
02:45	<evand>	Zaqq: your windows filesystem might just need to have chkdsk run over it.
02:45	<Crshman>	where do i go to set the dual screen settings in hardy then if it hasn't been removed?
02:45	<AlienX>	Assid, the restricted drivers?
02:45	<mayakuza>	Gravemind: your nott?
02:45	<cardstroker>	rkvirani, I just guessed, had to start somewhere and I don't know what is going to happen when I ever actually try to start gui mode.
02:45	<evilbug>	Pelo- k.
02:46	<evand>	Zaqq: go into windows, start, run, cmd, type chkdsk c: /f /r
02:46	<josh04>	Crshman: Screen Resolution, in Preferences
02:46	<Bubble_tea>	Anyone know How i use rarcrack!??
02:46	<osxdude>	soulc, guys, how is 8.04 going?
02:46	<Pelo>	Crshman, in prefs >	screen ?
02:46	<Assid>	AlienX: yeah
02:46	<Pici>	Bubble_tea: Read the manpage
02:46	<gravemind>	mayakuza: no.. maybe we should keep it in the channel
02:46	<biabia>	bazhang: my drives listed in my /etc/fstab wont mount with that kernel, but they mount fine with the previous kernel.  (-2.6.22-14-) In 'dmesg' it says the driver sd and sr need updating, but all I can find on google is bug reports.  cant find how to update the drivers
02:46	<osxdude>	*so
02:46	<howapt>	gravemind: thats a good thing
02:46	<gravemind>	mayakuza: are you registered with freenode?
02:46	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i sendt you pms what what i had problems whit
02:46	<bagelong>	josh04:  Done.  Now what.
02:46	<mayakuza>	nope
02:46	<gravemind>	mayakuza: I didn't get them
02:46	<osxdude>	I haven't upgraded yet, but i'm going to right now
02:46	<Zaqq>	evand: windows will chkdisk after reboot ..coz drive is locked ... i'll do cat /casper.log and return back over her
02:46	<Pelo>	osxdude, new releases are always painfull on helpers , joing in give us a hand
02:46	<AlienX>	Assid, i honestly have no idea which one comes with ubuntu as default as I've been using the development tree for some time now
02:46	<josh04>	bagelong: sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-common ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
02:46	<Zaqq>	evand: will safe mode help?
02:46	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
02:46	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i'l just tell you it here then
02:46	<SeaPhor>	josh04, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64453/
02:46	<PhilcoBill>	what is the command that is the same as windows chkdsk?
02:46	<gravemind>	mayakuza: alright
02:46	<Starnestommy>	PhilcoBill: fsck
02:47	<PhilcoBill>	thanks
02:47	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Will read
02:47	<icesword>	PhilcoBill, fsck
02:47	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i had a swap partisjon that was 200gb
02:47	<osxdude>	Well, i'm here, so yay
02:47	<Wilo>	i need help
02:47	<Pelo>	osxdude, do so from the atlernate cd , get it via torrents , the servers are taking a hit
02:47	<bazhang>	biabia: these are ntfs drives? or what
02:47	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i delited the partisjon in partisjon manager
02:47	<evand>	Zaqq: that's ok, you want it to do it after a reboot.  Just let it reboot into windows.
02:47	<Bubble_tea>	Pici not much help
02:47	<SeaPhor>	josh04, :-))
02:47	<leo_rockw>	aloha #ubuntu
02:47	<Pelo>	Wilo, we need quesitons
02:47	<me1>	Is there a server i can use that will download ubuntu faster than a day?!?
02:47	<d0lphin_n0el>	ermmm i'msorry the question but can someone explain to me why ... i make one copy paste from one cd backup ... and the i want to move from place or delet and it says i dont have permitions?! after i copy to the hard drive
02:47	<Bubble_tea>	Pici no man
02:47	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: i got the same error
02:47	<me1>	the new ubuntu*
02:47	<ffm_>	me1, bittorrent.
02:47	<osxdude>	Pelo, I would think so too. :)
02:47	<Bubble_tea>	Pici  http://lifehacker.com/380365/rarcrack-opens-protected-archives-without-passwords
02:47	<Pelo>	me1, get it with torrents
02:47	<AlienX>	me1, there might be some torrents
02:47	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  but i dont know how to download it?
02:47	<mayakuza>	gravemind: now i have 200gb that i can't putt into the ext3 but i can make a new one whit ext2
02:47	<bagelong>	josh04:  Do I need to do this.  I already have ndiswrapper installed.
02:47	<Pelo>	!torrents >	me1 use the alternate install cd
02:47	<AlienX>	Wolf23, there are full instructions on that page
02:47	<koomber1664>	I used the 'help me boot from CD' option for ubuntu but I didn't install, how do I disable the boot screen?
02:48	<gravemind>	mayakuza: you can't "resize" your ext3 partition?
02:48	<mayakuza>	gravemind: if i make a new partisjon whit 200gb ext2 will i make a new /home or how dos it work
02:48	<josh04>	bagelong: Do you have ndiswrapper-utils as well?
02:48	<biabia>	bazhang: 2 of them are  ext3 , and one is /dev/sda1 on /media/disk-1 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,noatime,allow_other,blksize=512)
02:48	<Assid>	AlienX: hrmm
02:48	<mayakuza>	Gravemind: no it's gray so i can't do ennything whit the ext3
02:48	<bagelong>	josh04:  I do not know.  Is there a way to know?
02:48	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: i got the same error
02:48	<bjb1959>	anyone know anything about hardy??
02:48	<AlienX>	Assid, ?
02:48	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  it says sudo apt-get remove envy <-- i dont understand this?
02:48	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm confused
02:48	<gravemind>	mayakuza: making a separate partition for /home is a good idea, but I would choose ext3 if I were you
02:48	<Assid>	gravemind: oh i had that issue yday.. was converting a guy to TRY ubuntu
02:48	<Pelo>	bjb1959, what do yo want to know ?
02:48	<AlienX>	Wolf23, you type that in :)
02:48	<doug_>	I'm having a problem with the nvidia driver for 8.04 AMD64.  Has anyone seen an actual solution?
02:48	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
02:49	<josh04>	bagelong: Just try the apt-get command and if it's already installed it'll just say
02:49	<AlienX>	Wolf23, but you don't have to worry about that as you're not upgrading
02:49	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  ok
02:49	<Assid>	gravemind: finally refused to resize the partition.. and hes like screw it.. and left it on vista
02:49	<Pelo>	doug_, what is the actual problem ?
02:49	<gravemind>	Assid: heh, wow
02:49	<mayakuza>	gravemind: so when i make a new i'l choose ext3?
02:49	<biabia>	bazant that last one is an external. all three drives mount fine if i select the previous kernel but when i select the new one i get an error saying i need to update the driver sd and sr
02:49	<ffm_>	Which is better in a mirror, latency or bandwidth?
02:49	<Assid>	gravemind: yeah.. it ran for over an hour and did NOTHING
02:49	<bazhang>	biabia: are you able to check their new listings and adjust fstab accordingly? able to mount them manually?
02:49	<doug_>	a black screen ... can get to ttys ok
02:49	<senghoo>	HI ~ ALL
02:49	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error http://www1.ca.dell.com/content/products/category.aspx/desktops?c=ca&cs=cadhs1&l=en&s=dhs
02:49	<bjb1959>	Pelo I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
02:49	<Pelo>	bjb1959, check i menu >	syusetm >	admin >	users check your user's permission  to shutdown
02:49	<nucco>	ffm_: both :) higher bandwidth, lower latency is better
02:49	<bagelong>	josh04:says I am good to go aready.
02:49	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes. now right now, are you running on the live cd, or are you installed already?
02:50	<AlienX>	ffm_, that's kind of a silly question as both factors are important
02:50	<mayakuza>	gravemind: then i'l have 2 filesystems whit ext3
02:50	<ffm_>	AlienX, I realize that.
02:50	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: wrong link?
02:50	<kbrooks>	question
02:50	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i have instaled allready
02:50	<josh04>	bagelong: type ndiswrapper -l, it shoul say no drivers isntalled
02:50	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes, however you also need a swap partition
02:50	<kbrooks>	how do i show the time directly on my desktop?
02:50	<Pelo>	doug_, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from the recovery mode
02:50	<gravemind>	mayakuza: of about 1 gb in size
02:50	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is there a wlan0 in iwconfig?
02:50	<ffm_>	AlienX, I mean is a mirror with higher latency but higher bandwith better than a close mirror with less bandwith?
02:50	<bazhang>	ffm_: bandwidth but kinda offtopic here
02:50	<Pelo>	kbrooks, gdesklets, or screenlets
02:50	<bjb1959>	Pelo Oh that's right, I forgot about making sure permissions are set right after upgrade. thanks I'll try that first
02:50	<doug_>	thanks ... I'll try it
02:50	<Pelo>	kbrooks, or conky or gtkrll
02:50	<mayakuza>	gravemind: oky. but how will thath efekt my system whit 2 ext3 systems?
02:50	<ffm_>	bazhang, Not really, this is about ubuntu repo mirrors.
02:50	<LainIwakura>	Hello.. I installed this font and it shows up in xfontsel but not in any drop-down fonts menu. How do I actually use the font? Thanks for any help.
02:50	<AlienX>	ffm_, neither is an indication of what download speeds you'll actually get
02:50	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  igot this E: Couldn't find package envyng
02:51	<osxdude>	Alright, downloading.
02:51	<evilbug>	Pelo- i completely re-installed gutsy and installed all the updates for it,and now when i log in it gets stuck on the light brown screen.
02:51	<kbrooks>	Pelo, ty
02:51	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings, but i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
02:51	<seriouslycgi>	anyone help me with samba configuration its kinda dead in the samba channel?
02:51	<bazhang>	ffm_: you creating one?
02:51	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i wont loose all the files i have now?
02:51	<nucco>	ffm_: probably... unless your pipe is smaller than the lower mirror, and you think it won't be crowded
02:51	<bagelong>	josh04:  in the terminal?  Nothing happended
02:51	<AlienX>	Wolf23, cd to the directory where you downloaded envy
02:51	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error configure: error: *** GTK+ >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first ***
02:51	<Darknezz>	 (HAHAHA sorry)
02:51	<ffm_>	bazhang, No.
02:51	<osxdude>	evilbug- install hardy :)
02:51	<cygoku_>	How are the repositories feeling right now ?!?!
02:51	<cardstroker>	rkvirani, what ya got?
02:51	<gravemind>	mayakuza: it doesn't make a difference in how your system will run, it's just a little bit safer to have /home on a separate partition. but you don't really have to
02:51	<AlienX>	Wolf23, though i *think* ubuntu has some tool that'll let you just click on the package and it'll install for you
02:51	<nucco>	ffm_: or use bittorrent and forget about bandwidth issues :)
02:51	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm stuck.  I can't figure out why that keeps failing
02:51	<evilbug>	osxdude- that didn't work,the install gave me crap :|
02:51	<osxdude>	cygoku_, I think they are good
02:51	<ffm_>	nucco, that won't work for APT, will it?
02:51	<josh04>	bagelong: Hold on while I find you a link
02:51	<gravemind>	mayakuza: the reason you can't resize your existing partition is because you're running on it
02:51	<bazhang>	ffm_: what is the exact nature of your issue then? just curious/chat or have actual issues creating a mirror
02:51	<osxdude>	evilbug- what kind of crap?
02:52	<Pelo>	Darknezz, install the related -dev package , look in synaptic
02:52	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  i dont download the envy, coz i dont know where is the download package
02:52	<gravemind>	mayakuza: if you boot up from the live cd, you will be able to resize it
02:52	<nucco>	ffm_: :p silly me :p
02:52	<ffm_>	bazhang, I'm choosing a mirror for my systems.
02:52	<Pelo>	ok I'M going on a brake, later folks
02:52	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it's on the page.
02:52	<cygoku_>	Cool.
02:52	<ffm_>	nucco, I bittorrent the ISOs of course...
02:52	<gravemind>	mayakuza: maybe that's what you should do, if you don't want 2 partitions
02:52	<nucco>	ffm_: latency generally won't affect the speed of the download
02:52	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it'll be something like envyng.deb or something
02:52	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i did but it still dont work
02:52	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i want to have 2 partisjons
02:52	<SeaPhor>	josh04, 1 sec,,
02:52	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i almost installed all the files
02:52	<gravemind>	mayakuza: good :)
02:52	<trippingmonke1>	does anyone here have any experience with the NVIDIA 169.12 driver in hardy?
02:52	<mayakuza>	gravemind: but i don't wanna lose the files i already have in /home
02:52	<josh04>	bagelong: Can you type lspci and copy me the line referring to Broadcom?
02:53	<bazhang>	ffm_: best to hold off on choosing; the ones you choose now may not be the best because of the recent release of hardy
02:53	<josh04>	SeaPhor: thanks
02:53	<gravemind>	mayakuza: ok, we will be careful, and not lose them
02:53	<binarybandit>	hey all, trying to install with wubi, and I just get dropped to an initramfs shell on reboot
02:53	<evilbug>	osxdude- a bunch of install errors.
02:53	<hdevalence>	hmm, would it be possible to have the gutsy->hardy updater download packages via torrent?
02:53	<seriouslycgi>	im trying to share a folder on a default install (ubuntu 7.10 server) of samba and im following a tutorial online to add the folder, but when i try to browse it in midnight commander it shows up but i cant desend into it. (error: cannot change directory) ive set up my user and password and enabled that user and the directory is owned by the same user details and has read write exe? my smb.conf http://rafb.net/p/ctwrju70.html
02:53	<gravemind>	mayakuza: I'll look for the guide that tells how to do what we're trying to do
02:53	<SeaPhor>	josh04, yes
02:53	<supertimmy>	how do i change the theme in hardy? what kind of theme files do i need to download?
02:53	<bagelong>	josh04: 0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4310 USB Controller (rev 01)
02:53	<mayakuza>	gravemind oky
02:53	<bazhang>	hdevalence: would be nice but no
02:53	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings for those drives,   i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
02:53	<evilbug>	osxdude- i got gutsy to work now :) nevermind.
02:53	<nankiller2>	ÃÃÂ±Â¹ÃÃ Â³ÂªÂ¿ÃÂ¶Ã³
02:53	<leo_rockw>	supertimmy: gnome-look.org will probably help you out
02:53	<osxdude>	evilbug- good :)
02:53	<gravemind>	mayakuza: http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/01/29/move-home-to-its-own-partition/
02:53	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Do any networks show up in nm-applet then?
02:53	<osxdude>	awww man
02:54	<Andross>	hello all, I'm having trouble with my laptop running hardy, it doesn't seem to want to bring up the onboard eth0 and I can't get wireless working without it
02:54	<mayakuza>	gravemind: ty
02:54	<ffm_>	bazhang, I get 1.9miB/s on MIT, and pretty much the same on olsol.
02:54	<evand>	binarybandit: try adding edd=on to the kernel command line.
02:54	<gravemind>	mayakuza: sure thing :)
02:54	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  u tols me to openhere-->	http://www.albertomilone.com/envyngfaq.html#A
02:54	<josh04>	bagelong: download this: ftp://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp33001-33500/sp33008.exe
02:54	<ffm_>	*osuols
02:54	<SeaPhor>	josh04, yes ill http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64455/
02:54	<ffm_>	*osuosl
02:54	<binarybandit>	the first time I attempted the install, it worked, but the partitioning tool failed with error code ten, so I uninstall, and tried a reinstall
02:54	<supertimmy>	leo_rockw: i am downloading themes from there but can't find how to import them
02:54	<binarybandit>	evand, mmk, thanks
02:54	<bazhang>	biabia: not sure if the instructions have changed for hardy; and you have the old ones around may you not try those out?
02:54	<mojo>	I've been using XChat for a few years but decided to try xchat-gnome.  Seems nice and clean but how do I remove join/part messages?
02:54	<leo_rockw>	supertimmy: oh, ok... i can't help you there, i'm a kde fanboi
02:54	<SeaPhor>	josh04, how do i get there?
02:54	<AlienX>	Wolf23, yes, go to that web page
02:54	<evand>	binarybandit: if that doesn't work, cat /casper.log at the initramfs prompt, shift page up and look for errors
02:54	<ffm_>	bazhang, Is there a program I can run that will do so automatically? The GUI just does latency.
02:55	<AlienX>	Wolf23, follow the directions there
02:55	<bazhang>	ffm_: nice to know thanks
02:55	<binarybandit>	thanks :)
02:55	<josh04>	SeaPhor: It's the one in the top right shaped like a computer
02:55	<AlienX>	Wolf23, then you should have working nvidia drivers
02:55	<doug2266778822>	anyone in here use convert x to dvd?
02:55	<fraserdp>	has anyone installed ndiswrapper with cisco aironet minipci 350 ?
02:55	<biabia>	bazhang: ok i dont remember checking the listing for the drives would you know the command for that
02:55	<evand>	binarybandit: also, removing 'quiet splash' from the kernel command line (escape at grub, e, then e on the kernel line) will show you more information
02:55	<Andross>	I need to know how to get a driver to control a certain network interface, I know it should happen automatically, but it isn't
02:55	<hdevalence>	bazhang: how hard would it be to do for next time?
02:55	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i have 2, 1 for lan and 2 for wlan
02:55	<thinkingfrog>	if composite is enabled in xorg.conf, but compiz effects aren't used, will there be a performance benefit?
02:55	<bazhang>	biabia: does fdisk -l show them?
02:55	<LainIwakura>	Hello.. I installed this font and it shows up in xfontsel but not in any drop-down fonts menu. How do I actually use the font? Thanks for any help.
02:55	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is your wireless network listed?
02:56	<Wolf23>	AlienX: i cant see the download package. just help me coz i am newbie on this
02:56	<dabbill>	When i play a DVD the people have blue skin. Also when i enable desktop effects my window borders disappear.
02:56	<SeaPhor>	josh04, no
02:56	<bazhang>	hdevalence: you mean instead of dpkg/apt/aptitude?
02:56	<bagelong>	josh04: It's downloaded.
02:56	<biabia>	bazhang: it does now, but i am on the older kernel. i will reboot and try it
02:56	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is your router turned on ;)
02:56	<AlienX>	Wolf23, see where it says "get envyng"?
02:56	<binarybandit>	ah, I see, windows is holding the drive, I just have to do a clean shutdown
02:56	<josh04>	bagelong: sudo apt-get install cabextract
02:56	<biabia>	bazhang: thanks! :)
02:56	<SeaPhor>	josh04, and iwlist wlan0 scan has nothing
02:56	<ffm_>	dabbill, Maybe you're watching a SciFi Film?
02:57	<dabbill>	ffm_, not quite lol
02:57	<SeaPhor>	josh04, yes my laptop next to me is going just fine
02:57	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Give me a moment
02:57	<hdevalence>	bazhang: well, you can dl the alt cd zand use packages from there, right? So, could one not download select portions of the torrent of the alternate cd?
02:57	<bagelong>	josh04: done
02:57	<seriouslycgi>	im trying to share a folder on a default install (ubuntu 7.10 server) of samba and im following a tutorial online to add the folder, but when i try to browse it in midnight commander it shows up but i cant desend into it. (error: cannot change directory) ive set up my user and password and enabled that user and the directory is owned by the same user details and has read write exe? my smb.conf http://rafb.net/p/ctwrju70.html
02:57	<heartsblood>	what is the pulseaudio mixser app?
02:57	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is your network WEP or WPA?
02:57	<heartsblood>	mixer*
02:57	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  no i cant see it
02:57	<SeaPhor>	josh04, wpa
02:57	<mojo>	thinkingfrog: that's a good question.  once upon i time i think what became compiz was either luminosity or tested there for concepts.  iirc luminosity was metacity with compositing.  but hey i won't swear that is correct, i am a little unsure
02:57	<tomoyuki28jp>	How can I make my apache to not to start when I boot my PC???
02:58	<bazhang>	hdevalence: you should really put that idea on !brainstorm as it seems most excellent
02:58	<DigitalNinja>	Are the Ubuntu servers working?
02:58	<mojo>	how do i disable JOIN/PART messages in xchat-gnome?
02:58	<hdevalence>	!brainstorm
02:58	<ubotu>	Post your ideas for ubuntu at http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com and vote for the ones you like!
02:58	<osxdude>	DigitalNinja, use a torrent to download the file.
02:58	<thinkingfrog>	mojo:  so are you saying the answer is "possibly"?
02:58	<josh04>	bagelong: move the .exe into it's own folder, then navigate there in the terminal and run cabextract filename
02:58	<SeaPhor>	josh04, wpa- i have the ssid and the passkey
02:58	<osxdude>	mojo, use xchat
02:58	<doug2266778822>	hello i need some help i am using convert x to dvd through wine, i got a blank dvd in it is asking me to insert one but it is in the drive what can i do?
02:58	<DigitalNinja>	osxdude: I'm trying to install a package on Hardy
02:58	<bagelong>	josh04:  what the say ah who?
02:58	<linkinxp>	so we wont get any new updates now that the final version is out????
02:58	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Try the "Other Wireless Network" option on Networkmanager
02:58	<leo_rockw>	mojo: shouldn't that be explained on the app manual?
02:58	<osxdude>	DigitalNinja, ah. I'm updating a file on Gusty and it's going pretty slow.
02:59	<dabbill>	When i play a DVD the people have blue skin. Also when i enable desktop effects my window borders disappear. Any one got any ideas? I cant seem to find any answers on the net.
02:59	<DigitalNinja>	osxdude: I see
02:59	<AlienX>	Wolf23, http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html
=== jhaarman is now known as esperegegu
02:59	<osxdude>	DigitalNinja, it's at 18KB/s
02:59	<Bubble_tea>	Can someone show me how to run or use rarcrack
02:59	<AstralSin>	ok, anyone who's upgraded to hardy from gutsy, is evolution-data-server consuming 90+% of your cpu?
02:59	<r557>	hello.  if i'm using a free dns service that points to a development server, then do i also need to be running a dns on that development server?  i'm using dyndns as a free dns
02:59	<ffm_>	What date did hardy come out?
02:59	<SeaPhor>	josh04,  how do i get that
02:59	<ffm_>	r557, No.
02:59	<gravemind>	april 24
02:59	<Bubble_tea>	I keep getting   adding: - (deflated 15%)
02:59	<Bubble_tea>	bash: 7z]: command not found
02:59	<osxdude>	Nom-, r557
02:59	<osxdude>	crap!
02:59	<ffm_>	AstralSin, No.
02:59	<osxdude>	no r557
03:00	<AstralSin>	k
03:00	<josh04>	bagelong: just type "mkdir driver && mv sp*.exe ./driver && cabextract ./driver/sp*.exe"
03:00	<AstralSin>	mine is
03:00	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Click the icon, it should be third from bottom
03:00	<esperegegu>	I just updated my laptop to 804 and now I can't login anymore. When I type my username and press enter it immediately saids: "Authentication failed' (So before it even asks my password) Anyone experienced that and has a solution cause I'm really stuck here..... !!!! ??
03:00	<ffm_>	Bubble_tea, http://rarcrack.sourceforge.net/
03:00	<SeaPhor>	josh04,  no, not there
03:00	<r557>	oh ok.  can i configure sendmail on these types of hosts as well?
03:00	<r557>	a free dns
03:00	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  ok get it legacy or the other?
03:01	<ffm_>	esperegegu, Uh, did you inturrupt the upgrade process in any way?
03:01	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Did you click "connect to other wireless network"?
03:01	<Darknezz>	how can i send code on here?
03:01	<esperegegu>	ffm_: nope
03:01	<r557>	i.e. email@xxx.freedns.org
03:01	<Darknezz>	whats the link
03:01	<ffm_>	Dark-Fx, What?
03:01	<ffm_>	Darknezz, What?
03:01	<ffm_>	Dark-Fx, Oops, sorry.
03:01	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it depends on what card you have. How old is your computer?
03:01	<mojo>	thinkingfrog: i really can't say.  i am not sure if it switches WMs when you disable effects.  i don't think it does, however, as i seem to remember some of the key bindings from compiz still working w/o fx
03:01	<ffm_>	esperegegu, Can you do "CTRL ALT F1" and log in?
03:01	<mikebot>	Since printing through evince doesn't work for me, is there any other way I can print pdf documents?
03:01	<darkcrab>	i installed ubuntu themes for firefox but they wont show up in firefox, anyone have any suggestions???
03:01	<Darknezz>	the link to paste code
03:01	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  it is from this year
03:02	<Darknezz>	rather than spamming
03:02	<ceeejay>	Wow, busy tonight!
03:02	<ffm_>	!pastebin >	Darknezz (see pm from ubotu)
03:02	<bagelong>	josh04: this is what I got - mkdir: cannot create directory `driver': File exists
03:02	<thinkingfrog>	mojo:  I'll reboot, enable effects, and come back to tell you my findings
03:02	<darkcrab>	its hardy heron ceejay
03:02	<mojo>	thinkingfrog: i meant, really, that i think it is an intersting question and i would be interested to know what someone had to share
03:02	<ffm_>	ceeejay, yeah, 400 more ppl than usuall.
03:02	<esperegegu>	ffm_: I'll start up again. the only thing I managed  to do so far was starting in recovery mode
03:02	<AlienX>	Wolf23, then don't get the legacy driver
03:02	<ceeejay>	I just performed the upgrade and have no video
03:02	<ffm_>	esperegegu, I had that issue and ended up reinstalling.
03:02	<bagelong>	josh04: I did move the file to it's own folder.
03:02	<theunixgeek>	I installed Ubuntu on my MacBook but now I can't boot from the Ubuntu partition. How do I fix this?
03:02	<SeaPhor>	josh04, on the 1 st, lan i have "wired network" and "manual configuration" and on the 2nd icon it starts the "wlan0 connection properties"
03:02	<darkcrab>	i installed ubuntu themes for firefox but they wont show up in firefox, anyone have any suggestions???
03:02	<Darknezz>	#
03:02	<heartsblood>	how do you restart the pulseaudio daemon?
03:02	<josh04>	bagelong: just my unfortunate choice of folder name. try it again, replacing "driver" with "driver2" :P
03:02	<mikebot>	Are there any other free tools in ubuntu that I can use to print pdfs?
03:02	<ffm_>	theunixgeek, What happens when you try to boot?
03:03	<esperegegu>	ffm_: that's no option ..... 2 much stuff there.
03:03	<jstritar>	What do I do if my upgrade completely failed, i have no network and the video doesn't work?
03:03	<seriouslycgi>	ffm_, it was only 900 when i came in about 20 minutes ago thats a fast increase in population
03:03	<theunixgeek>	ffm_: when I hold down alt, I don't get a choice to boot into the Linux partition - only the OS X partition
03:03	<seamus7>	darkcrab: did you look in the addons menu item for 'themes' and enable you new theme?
03:03	<theunixgeek>	mikearr: File >	Print >	Print to File....
03:03	<ffm_>	esperegegu, is /home not on a separate partition? Darn.
03:03	<ffm_>	seriouslycgi, it's a timezone thing.
03:03	<TheFearsomeFufu>	I'm trying to upgrade to Hardy. However, when ever I try to, the upgrade tool thing says I don't have enough disk space. How can I clear more space? I emptied my trash, and there's hardly anything on my desktop or home folder or anything. I dunno why it's saying I don't have enough room.
03:03	<mojo>	leo_rockw: i will check the manual, just though i'd ask quick since like there's a 99% chance many of the users here are running it and would know off the top of their head.  Xchat it was on the channel-tab context menus.  Just trying xchat-gnome out and wanted to spare my screen.
03:03	<josh04>	SeaPhor: What happens if you click "wlan0 connection properties"?
03:03	<bagelong>	josh04: every place it says driver?
03:04	<josh04>	bagelong: yes
03:04	<darkcrab>	yes I did seamus7, it is a group of themes, and they dont show up
03:04	<ffm_>	TheFearsomeFufu, Uh, how much free space is on the disk?
03:04	<ceeejay>	Would anyone be willing to step me thru some basics since my upgrade?
03:04	<esperegegu>	ffm_: pressing ctrl-alt-F1 gives me a prompt. when I type my username and enter it sails login incorrect immediately, even before I have to type my password
03:04	<ffm_>	theunixgeek, I don't use OSX, so I can't be _all_ that much help. Sorry.
03:04	<jstritar>	is there a way to "continue" an upgrade if it failed... or try again?
03:04	<TheFearsomeFufu>	ffm_: 1.2 GB.
03:04	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  sudo rm -R /usr/share/envy
03:04	<Wolf23>	rm: cannot remove `/usr/share/envy': No such file or directory
03:04	<jo3>	Is there any1 who knows how to set up an bnc server, like psybnc?
03:04	<seamus7>	darkcrab: did you actually install the individual themes .. or just download them? do they say they work in FF3?
03:04	<Darknezz>	the error im gettin is this http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64456/
03:04	<bagelong>	josh04: it says command not found
03:04	<AlienX>	Wolf23, don't worry about that. Did you download the package?
03:05	<esperegegu>	ffm_: no more clues?
03:05	<SeaPhor>	when i click 2nd icon the properties box opens up, and i have a configure button ,, which has all the info, ssid and passkey
03:05	<ffm_>	esperegegu, Have you tried single-usering it and "deluser <user>; adduser <user>; chown <user>	/home/<user>/" to readd your user?
03:05	<oddalot>	anyone here got the emerald repositories tab to work?
03:05	<Bubble_tea>	How do i use rarcrack your_encrypted_archive.ext [--threads thread_num] [--type rar|zip|7z]
03:05	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  no i am following like in the website
03:05	<josh04>	bagelong: Gah. We'll take this more slowly then. Is the .exe in a folder on it's own? What's the folder called?
03:05	<darkcrab>	seamus7, I got them from add/remove applications under applications and they are called "ubuntu firefox themes"
03:05	<ffm_>	TheFearsomeFufu, Uh, you can remove software that you arn't using...
03:05	<darkcrab>	they are for hardy heron
03:05	<Bubble_tea>	How do i use rarcrack your_encrypted_archive.ext [--threads thread_num] [--type rar|zip|7z]?

03:10	<josh04>	bagelong: now what happens when you type ndiswrapper -l?
03:10	<thinkingfrog>	moto:  but that didn't fix the compiz problem...so having compiz working may improve performance, if only to know that your driver is working right
03:10	<ubuntu__>	what is the best way to install on usb
03:10	<mikebot>	ffm_: I'm not sure if it's the case that noboday knows the answer, or that nobody read the question.
03:10	<ubuntu__>	pesistent or not?
03:10	<esperegegu>	ffm_: that did not help... more suggestions?
03:10	<ffm_>	mikebot, In any case, repeating it won't help.
03:10	<bagelong>	josh04:  It says driver installed.  :-D
03:11	<ffm_>	esperegegu, Ask in ubuntuforums or on the mailing lists.
03:11	<josh04>	bagelong: does it say "device present"?
03:11	<mikebot>	ffm_: Well, if no one read the question, I can't expect an answer without repeating.
03:11	<esperegegu>	ffm_: k. thx

03:11	<bagelong>	josh04:  No, just bcmwl5 : driver installed
03:11	<logi2>	hi guys, i just upgraded to hardy from gutsy, and now i cant enable desktop effects on my laptop (ati) everything was working before i upgraded
03:11	<ffm_>	esperegegu, I'd say plug in an external disk or scp /home to another box, then reinstall, unfortunatelyu.
03:11	<mikebot>	ffm_: I didn't know that no one read, but I also didn't know that anyone had read it.

03:19	<MewRS>	nucco: but the pendrive blinked..
03:19	<SeaPhor>	josh04, ? thats the same one i sent b4?
03:19	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn, did you check in the repositories ?  menu >	sytem>	admin >	synaptic
03:19	<xyzpaw>	is ssh for hacking?
03:19	<ffm_>	jstritar, It did, when you first installed them.
03:19	<nucco>	MewRS: second time I'm seeing that today, means the drive is probably gone for good

03:19	<seriouslycgi>	mikebot, theres more channels like #lfd (linux for dummies) ##linux etc so if one is really overloaded try in another chan that what i do

03:19	<jstritar>	ffm_: yeah, well when they don't support the latest graphics cards you have to do that
03:19	<SeaPhor>	josh04, what should have changed? i made no changes?
03:19	<MewRS>	nucco: =( no chance of ressurect?
03:19	<Pelo>	xyzpaw, go to wikipedia.com and search for ssh or secure shell
03:20	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: hacking is not what you think it is...
03:20	<jstritar>	ffm_: they shouldn't pretend like you can upgrade
03:20	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Well, it can be used by malicious black-hat hackers.
03:20	<Starnestommy>	xyzpaw: it's usually used for remote administration of servers
03:20	<xyzpaw>	can you use ssh to anonymously torrent
03:20	<ffm_>	jstritar, They don't _pretend_.
03:20	<Peddy>	ï»¿can someone tell me how to bring back window shadows in Hardy?
03:20	<darkcrab>	mozilla has always encouraged people to use its test releases rather than its stable releases.
03:20	<nucco>	MewRS: if the partitioning software can't access the drive, I can't think of what next to do, sorry
03:20	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: you can use ssh to control rtorrent, for example
03:20	<slashzul>	how do you add gnome desktop on a ubuntu server install? gdm?
03:20	<ffm_>	jstritar, When you install "community supported software" it isn't supported by canonical.
03:20	<gooody>	Pelo: pidgin doesn't support voice and videos yet. i'm not sure of the amsn yet.
03:20	<Pelo>	xyzpaw, you are thinking of proxy servers , google for tor
03:20	<mikebot>	seriouslycgi: Thank you, I wasn't aware.
03:20	<MewRS>	nucco: ill try the mkfs on entire drive, so..
03:20	<artenius>	lewench: hit numlock
03:20	<d33d>	I need to fix my Firefox 3.05b flash, for some reason its like screwed up...In order to play any flash I have to click some stupid Circle with an arrow in it, and it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt...any ideas?
03:20	<josh04>	SeaPhor: I'm not best sure, to be honest
03:20	<Zaqq>	installed heron using wubi ... installed nvidia drivers and some apps .. restarted ... booting halts with a (initramfs) prompt...
03:20	<mikebot>	ffm_: Right, but this is the free support channel, correct?
03:20	<Nutzebahn>	Pelo, yes, I did. Help?
03:20	<ffm_>	slackd00d, just gnome, or the whole ubuntu desktop thing?
03:20	<MewRS>	nucco: if everything is already messed up, there is nothing to lose, right?
03:20	<ffm_>	mikebot, Yes.
03:20	<nucco>	MewRS: my verdict though, is that the drive is history. and mkfs on the entire drive won't work either.
03:20	<osxdude>	!proxy
03:20	<ubotu>	Many Ubuntu IRC channels prohibit access from !proxies such as !TOR and web (Java, etc) gateways due to a high level of abuse. You can however obtain a hostmask cloak: see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#cloaks
03:20	<jstritar>	ffm_: that doesn't mean ubuntu should upgrade without warning you it might break your entire system
03:21	<lewench>	artenius, ITS ON!
03:21	<xyzpaw>	how do you use ssh to control rtorrent?
03:21	<MewRS>	nucco: Kingston R.I.P.
03:21	<w30>	xyzpaw: ssh is a secure version of telnet that can't be intercepted to get keystrokes for login names and passwords (greatly simplified)
03:21	<slashzul>	does GDM install add desktop to a server instsall?
03:21	<xrc>	you don't use ssh to control torrent
03:21	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: i'm pretty sure there are many tutorials out there on the internets. i never used rtorrent myself
03:21	<ffm_>	jstritar, Uh, that's implicit in any upgrade. You should always back up data, but especially with system updates.
03:21	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn,  that's where i look when I want software,  you can try google , Ihave no more suggestion but I've seen it mentioned on digg I think ,
03:21	<osxdude>	Lol, I have the same EXACT type of Kingston memory in the family computer right now
03:21	<jstritar>	ffm_: do you know of way of trying to resolve upgrade issues?
03:21	<MewRS>	nucco: no way to try to write a disklabel from term? :P
03:21	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Basically, it is easier for malicious people to hack into you if you use telnet.
03:21	<josh04>	xyzpaw: You ssh in, run screen, open rtorrent, set it up, detach from screen and log out of ssh
03:21	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: but rtorrent is not anonymous

03:22	<nucco>	MewRS: you can do that via an argument to mkfs, but that particular drive is hosed :)
03:22	<josh04>	MewRS: I presume parted can do it, but I don;t know how
03:22	<Pelo>	totocool, ask in #kubuntu or #kde
03:22	<leo_rockw>	josh04: he's going to ask you what screen is now :-P
03:22	<ffm_>	jstritar, Best way is a fresh install, but what's the broken package?
03:22	<jstritar>	ffm_: i don't know b/c i closed the window and there's no log. but after restarting i have no network & the video is messed up
03:22	<bjb1959>	Pelo, your suggestion didn't work. can't find anything in system>admin>users about logoff or shutdown and setting authorizations doesn't work either any more ideas?
03:22	<jstritar>	ffm_: a lot of packages failed near the end
03:22	<MewRS>	InGunsWeTrust: could not too! =(

03:23	<ffm_>	jstritar, Uh, why'd you close the window? The generic fix is "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a" to reconfigure all packages. Try that first.
03:23	<n-iCe>	Pelo,  oh
03:23	<pd0x>	hell all, just upgraded
03:23	<gravemind>	Shortyjacobs: heh, well so I hope

03:23	<MewRS>	nucco: the logical sector must be toasted out..
03:23	<bjb1959>	Pelo, your suggestion didn't work. can't find anything in system>admin>users about logoff or shutdown and setting authorizations doesn't work either any more ideas?
03:23	<jstritar>	ffm_: i dunno it was stupid of me
03:23	<nucco>	MewRS: good luck
03:23	<ants>	Ok, so I have a problem, my update manager dissappeared in the middle of upgrading, and it's still running

03:24	<pd0x>	has anyone been having problems with screen resolution?
03:24	<nucco>	MewRS: err, that statement about "logical sector" didn't make much sense ;)
03:24	<br24>	anyone having nfs issues with desktop mounts?
03:24	<ants>	It's disappeared, and I want to kill it and restart so I can moniter it
03:24	<xyzpaw>	hey josh could you please continue what you were talking about before?

03:24	<ffm_>	ants, Try ALT+TABing to it? CTRL+ALT+(Directional Key) to another desktop?
03:24	<ffm_>	ants, Bad idea.

03:24	<josh04>	SeaPhor: I see it
03:24	<ffm_>	ants, That may cause broken packages. Are you in the middle of a dist-upgrade?
03:25	<ants>	yes
03:25	<staing>	what's a good way to get caught up to speed with ubuntu
03:25	<josh04>	xyzpaw: I only know about it in theory, I've never done it

03:25	<MewRS>	nucco: yeah.. but.. i am a brazilian that never made any english classes... =)
03:25	<nucco>	MewRS: LOL. I meant the statement doesn't have much technical meaning
03:25	<Pelo>	TheAceOfHearts, ask in #hardware
03:25	<ffm_>	ants, If packages havn't been installed yet, you can just killall update-manager
03:25	<ants>	It's only retreaving packs right now
03:25	<TheAceOfHearts>	lee3008: He doesn't have the money for that... He barely has money for the HDD...
03:25	<bjb1959>	Pelo, thanks

03:25	<ffm_>	!repomirror | cardstroker
03:25	<ubotu>	cardstroker: Go to "System",  "Administration", and "Software Sources" and choose "Other" from the drop down box. Then choose "select best server" and your system will choose the closest mirror to you automatically.
03:25	<SeaPhor>	josh04, that's the one that clicking on it opens the other box on the screen, clicking configur on that box opens the other box on the screen

03:26	<staing>	but want to learn the ins and outs
03:26	<Pelo>	cardstroker, the servers are all under heavy load becaus of all the ppl upgrading online,  you are better off getting hthe alternnate cd torerent and upgrading from that
03:26	<ffm_>	lee3008, just type "!upgrade | lee3008 " and ubotu will send him the message.
03:26	<Pelo>	mojo, what,s the issue ?

03:27	<LainIwakura>	I installed xfonts-artwiz using a.deb package. It shows up in xfontsel, but not in any font drop-down menu. I cannot set the font anywhere. I enabled bitmapped font and also restarted my computer. Any ideas? Thanks.

03:27	<Darknezz>	ffm_: it dont work.
03:27	<mojo>	Pelo: xchat-gnome does not use tabs.  it is a "clean interface" variant of xchat.  thought i'd give it a spin.
03:27	<ffm_>	Darknezz, "sudo aptitude install xmms"
03:27	<nucco>	MewRS: that's ok, just tell the owner that their drive is toast!
03:27	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Check "Enable Roaming Mode", then click the two PC's up by the volume meter and click "Connect to other wireless network"
03:27	<lee3008>	aww k thanks

03:27	<MewRS>	nucco: right! thanks a lot =)
03:27	<SeaPhor>	josh04, the whole reason i tried the 8.04 live cd was because i can do a fresh install if i need, my /home directory is on a seperate partition
03:27	<cardstroker>	pelo, I'm downloading from the command prompt.  How do I get that CD?

03:28	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Okies
03:28	<mojo>	Pelo: fwiw it is nice and clean, but can pee up a rope if it lacks that basic ability.  join/parts can be annoying
03:28	<eklof>	Any "simple" way to install ubuntu on an USB-stick ?
03:28	<migm1>	is there a specific user that postfix/saslauthd starts as? i obviously have a permission problem

03:29	<mojo>	Pelo: it does have a couple nice ideas... but i also have xchat installed.  i think i'm going back.
03:29	<nucco>	MewRS: most software is still 32-bit centric
03:29	<Pelo>	mikebot, I told you it's a bug,  check in the forum if anyone found a solution it's in there

03:47	<Pelo>	Konedima, ok ,  this is going to be a bit problematic ,  I donT, supppseyou can access you ubuntu partition from windows ?

03:55	<josh04>	SeaPhor: From what I can see, it looks like the RTL driver doesn't work with WPA, which is a bit weird
03:55	<Pelo>	USN1520, not at all ,  but donT' upgrade online if you can avoid it , upgrade from the alternate instal cd or the dvd  and get them in torrent,   the servers are taking a big hit

03:55	<Pelo>	mrkeishii, ask in #kubuntu

03:56	<Pelo>	d4t4min32, same thing,  use the one in admin
03:56	<agmishra>	demonspork, you would need the -dev package
03:56	<jsoftw>	I assume the ubuntu servers will be loaded right now?
03:56	<mino>	any french channel?
03:56	<samy>	Well pelo ... I have a 1920 * 1200 screen and the performance is sluggish ...

03:56	<Pelo>	jsoftw, yes upgrade from the alt cd or dvd ,  get the torrent
03:56	<agmishra>	demonspork, that would be most probabaly gtk-2.10-dev or something like that
03:57	<arvind_khadri>	samy, updating xorg-core is breaking things
03:57	<ruewan>	oi
03:57	<howapt>	night all
03:57	<samy>	even with ATI ?
03:57	<miggilinme>	I'm trying to get the legacy rt2500 driver installed on Hardy, as whatever is in there is not working
03:57	<Pelo>	samy, did anyone tell you it would help ?
03:57	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: i have the rt2500 and its not working for me either
03:57	<ruewan>	gksu does not seem to work right when i launch it using alt+f2
03:57	<samy>	actually ..no ... but I am assuming that new is better .
03:57	<USN1520>	the throttling of the servers pays tribute to how great ubuntu is
03:57	<miggilinme>	you mean the legacy driver?
03:58	<miggilinme>	also not working?
03:58	<thompa>	jsoftw: i lost a connection to repos once but now ok
03:58	<thinkingfrog>	how do drivers in Linux work?  do they have to be compiled into the kernel when they are "installed"?
03:58	<thinkingfrog>	is this what installing means?
03:58	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: problems with wifi?
03:58	<Jordan_U>	ruewan, In what way?
03:58	<Twilt>	I have a question about the Wubi Grub menu.  I understand it automatically loads Windows by default after a few seconds on a dual-boot system.  How many seconds does it stay on the OS select menu until it automatically loads Windows.  3, 5, or 10 seconds?
03:58	<B_166-ER-X>	Hardy, fresh install. had sound...rebooted, and now i dont.    I need help, i had this problem for 6 months, (no sound on 1/2 reboot)  and never found the cause, was hoping that the new release would fix that. it didnt.    Help ..
03:58	<Pelo>	ruewan, gksu is just a prefix command to run the command ias root,  it needs a command after
03:58	<miggilinme>	Yes, the connection with the new driver is horrid
03:58	<gravemind>	thinkingfrog: they are added to the kernel as 'modules' somehow
03:58	<Twilt>	Help
03:58	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i followed this once, maybe i'll try again
=== B_166-ER-X is now known as b166erx
03:58	<Starnestommy>	thinkingfrog: they can usually be compiled as a module then loaded into the kernel without compiling it into the kernel
03:58	<Dr_willis>	thinkingfrog,  normally 'drivers' are modules loaded by the kernel as needed, thus making the proper /dev/devices for the hardware or other things
03:58	<porta-Farhan>	i have a broadcom wireless pci card in my hp laptop I will hate fixing it to get it to work
03:58	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i followed this once, maybe i'll try again- http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=318539
03:58	<ruewan>	i go alt+f2 then type gksu synaptic
03:58	<samy>	Pelo ... actually ..no ... but I am assuming that new is better .

08:42	<arvind_khadri>	 function like a public_html ?
>	:58	<CaptainMorgan>	standard
03:58	<ruewan>	it would ask me for my password then nothing
03:58	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: same, it wont stay connected to my router, it drops out every 20 seconds but... it will connect to my neighbors network just fine
03:58	<bjb1959>	logoff/reboot icon won't work after upgrade to hardy. only ctrl+alt+backspace works any ideas anyone?
03:59	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: its soo weird
03:59	<ruewan>	i do the same thing in gnome terminal and it works
03:59	<gravemind>	thinkingfrog: they can be compiled into the kernel I think, but most ppl don't
03:59	<thinkingfrog>	so, restricted drivers, they are modules that are "loaded" into the kernel
03:59	<Pelo>	samy, in linux you assume wrong, in linux new means troubleshooting ,  old means stable and reliable
03:59	<miggilinme>	is there any way to get back to the old driver?
03:59	<thinkingfrog>	what does "loaded" mean?
03:59	<bagelon1>	josh04: still there.  That last step through me for a loop.  Lost my connection.
03:59	<USN1520>	B_166-ER, did you run alsamixer
03:59	<Pelo>	thinkingfrog, yes
03:59	<linkinxp>	so we wont get any new updates now that the final version is out????
03:59	<Jordan_U>	thinkingfrog, Most drivers are either installed by default or available as packages, try System ->	Administration ->	Hardware Drivers if you have hardware which requires proprietary drivers
03:59	<thinkingfrog>	gravemind:  compiled into the kernel = faster
03:59	<ruewan>	started happening after i upgraded to hardy
03:59	<josh04>	bagelon1: you're back XD
03:59	<ToddEDM>	can anyone see this text?
03:59	<gravemind>	thinkingfrog: yeah, but less convenient if you want to change :) it's a trade off
03:59	<josh04>	bagelon1: I'm such a pillock
03:59	<neil_d>	what version of postgresql is in hardy heron ?
03:59	<bagelon1>	josh04:  Not sure what happened.  Was prevuiously
03:59	<miggilinme>	I found a package called rt2500-source, but have been unable to compile it
03:59	<b166erx>	USN1520 eh , what do you mean ?
03:59	<Dr_willis>	ToddEDM,  yes. :) what would you do if we all said no?
03:59	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: have you found a fix yet?
04:00	<josh04>	SeaPhor: That's worth a shot
04:00	<Twilt>	Can someone help me?
04:00	<thinkingfrog>	Jordan_U:  I'm trying to understand how Restricted Driver Manager even works
04:00	<arvind_khadri>	linkinxp, you'll get updates when they are loaded onto the repos
04:00	<Pelo>	linkinxp, new updates for waht ? 7.04 ?  you will get updates for 12 months to come  but now in the next week I think
04:00	<miggilinme>	Nothing but "go back to the old driver"
04:00	<Twilt>	lt	I have a question about the Wubi Grub menu. I understand it automatically loads Windows by default after a few seconds on a dual-boot system. How many seconds does it stay on the OS select menu until it automatically loads Windows. 3, 5, or 10 seconds?
04:00	<USN1520>	run alsamixer from terminal and tell me what you see
04:00	<arvind_khadri>	Twilt, if you ask
04:00	<bagelon1>	josh04:  was previously bagelong.  now emma2900  not sure how that heppened
04:00	<bjb1959>	logoff/reboot icon won't work after upgrade to hardy. only ctrl+alt+backspace works any ideas anyone?
04:00	<samy>	OK .. thank you pelo .. is there a site where I can find the optimal configuration for my specific laptop ?
04:00	<josh04>	bagelon1: It was roughly 30 seconds after you stopped replying that I remembered b44 is an ethernet driver
04:00	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: what wifi are you using... card device
04:00	<Starnestommy>	Twilt: I think it's 3 seconds
04:00	<b166erx>	USN1520 well, yes. Nothing is muted.   I thought about this, since 6 months.
04:00	<miggilinme>	pcmcia
04:00	<Pelo>	Twilt,  generaly the default timout in grub is 8 seconds
04:00	<thinkingfrog>	gravemind:  the performance benefits probably aren't worth the headache, otherwise more people would do it
04:00	<ToddEDM>	Dr.Willis prolly fix it
04:00	<linkinxp>	Pelo,  8.04 lmao i know i know im in the wrong channel
=== c is now known as Charitwo
04:00	<bagelon1>	josh04 what now?
04:00	<josh04>	bagelon1:And physially slapped myself :P
04:00	<miggilinme>	belkin f5d7000

04:01	<arvind_khadri>	Twilt, you can change the time out optin
04:01	<USN1520>	second reboot only huh?
04:01	<golak>	has anyone installed ruby on gutsy using packet manager? plz i need help
04:01	<Pelo>	linkinxp, what are you inquiring about ?
04:01	<samy>	Thank you Pelo ... have a good day'
04:01	<Dominoes>	does anyone here use an MX revolution with 8.04?
04:01	<Jordan_U>	thinkingfrog, It simply uses apt to download the corrosponding package, for gfx drivers it then changes the driver section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and when X starts it uses modprobe to load the module
04:01	<josh04>	Bagelon1: It was my fault you crashed, I mucked up one of the commands
04:01	<Pelo>	samy, too late for me , save yourself
04:01	<linkinxp>	Pelo,  i dont know i havent got any updates for 2 days im worried jajajaaja
04:01	<b166erx>	USN1520 i booted 3 time with sound, before this one..whitout.
04:01	<InGunsWeTrust>	Has anybody successfully installed zsnes on 64 bit hardy?
04:01	<josh04>	bagelon1: So, sorry :P
04:01	<Starnestommy>	neil_d: 8.3
04:01	<neil_d>	Starnestommy: ok thanks.
04:01	<Twilt>	Is it 8 seconds or 3 seconds on the Grub menu?
04:01	<USN1520>	what does lsmod say?
04:01	<Pici>	linkinxp: Hardy has been released....
04:01	<d4t4min32>	miggilinme: what is the "old" driver
04:01	<Starnestommy>	Twilt: I believe it's 3
04:02	<LiraNuna>	anyone knows why ubuntu ships with libpng 1.2.15 when the latest version is 1.2.26 ?
04:02	<Twilt>	Okay
04:02	<thinkingfrog>	Jordan_U:  so then, the key is the proper packages and a properly configured xorg.conf file
04:02	<Twilt>	good
04:02	<linkinxp>	Pici,  i know so no any more updates?
04:02	<thinkingfrog>	I should read the xorg.conf man page
04:02	<bagelon1>	josh04:  I rebooted and now I am back online wiht the computer you mucked as you say, but now I am  typing on another computer.  Any more help?  I have a terminal open
04:02	<Pelo>	linkinxp,  you have 8.04 RC there aren'T any updates,  your on the official release more or less,  don'T expecct updates for a couple of weeks ,
04:02	<b166erx>	beside struggling at the linux 'gurus' whou thought it would be nice to remove XMMS from the repos, i didnt do much since then
04:02	<miggilinme>	I don't know, if I understand correctly it's rt2500
04:02	<Pinky>	is the main ubuntu upgrade host abnormally busy because of people installing hardy or something? my computer is upgrading at 50 kB/s or so... :\
04:02	<demonspork>	agmishra, I can't find any -dev packages for gtk :(
04:02	<linkinxp>	Pelo,  hooo ok perfect thanks
04:02	<miggilinme>	but even then, I'm not sure
04:02	<Pelo>	LiraNuna, ubuntu ships with stable not bleeding edge
04:02	<arvind_khadri>	Twilt, why dont you check that out yourself
04:02	<josh04>	Type dmesg|grep ssb and see if it gets anything
04:02	<miggilinme>	doesn't make much sense
04:02	<Starnestommy>	demonspork: not even libgtk2.0-dev ?
04:02	<d4t4min32>	thats what im on.. the rt2500, is terriable
04:02	<jsoftw>	Anyone know where a basic changelog between 7 and 8 is?
04:02	<miggilinme>	and the serialmonkey site is down
04:02	<LiraNuna>	Pelo, 1.2.26 was available for quite some time
04:02	<Pici>	linkinxp: Not unless theres a security bug or something makes it into backports.  We don't have a rolling release like Debian.
04:02	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i've done it twice before at least, but who knows and a big THANK YOU! for trying, if you wake up in the middle of the night with a dream answer for my issue,,, go back to sleep, i'll be around tomorrow, (unless they take my CAT5 while i'm sleeping!)
04:02	<thinkingfrog>	is Linux like windows, in that sometimes uninstalling and reinstalling drivers can fix problems?
04:02	<jstritar>	so i guess part of my upgrade failed b/c i use the IBM jvm rather than sun's jvm.

04:03	<bagelon1>	josh04:  I would, but I don't know what that character is after dmesg
04:03	<Pici>	thinkingfrog: no, it doesnt really work like that
04:03	<arvind_khadri>	thinkingfrog, what exactly is your problem
04:03	<josh04>	bagelon1: It's the pipe, it should be to the right of z
04:03	<demonspork>	Starnestommy, thx, the lib threw me off

04:03	<thinkingfrog>	and compiz doesn't work
04:03	<SeaPhor>	josh04, yeah, was hoping it would just work with the 8.04 live cd :-(
04:04	<bagelon1>	josh04:  I keep seeing it, but don't know how to type it.  To the right of z is x.  Do I hold down alt or what
04:04	<b166erx>	USN1520 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64464/
04:04	<Pelo>	thinkingfrog, have you asked in #compiz ?
04:04	<Pazy>	Is there an easy way to get the Rt2500 Wireless adaptors stuff from the Repo and manually transfer it to Ubuntu so I can set up network (and internet) access?
04:04	<josh04>	SeaPhor: It may well do if 8.04 has a newer version of the rtl driver

04:10	<Pelo>	porta-Farhan, ok  then  can't help,  try checking in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org or ask again periodicaly maybe you'llget someone that knows
04:10	<bagelon1>	josh04: ssp: Sonics Silicon Backplane found on PCI device 0000:03:00.0
04:10	<bazhang>	Paddy_EIRE: it's actually quite nice imo
04:10	<Pelo>	cardstroker, does the gui work ?
04:10	<b166erx>	USN1520    I already have 'alsa-base' installed, is there any other package i need ?
04:10	<mojo>	sorry, pelo, i couldn't see you type here i was busy being confused by your pm-block.  sorry.  sorry.  sorry.  i thought you were just being rude and f'ing with me
04:10	<porta-Farhan>	I was wonding about how linux would react to one of those new apple keyboard
04:10	<bagelon1>	josh04:  I need to get bak on on the computer I am trying to fix, but now I can't figure out how to open an IRC with the Piidgen messenger
04:11	<d4t4min3r>	ok i have the drivers and compiz installed how do i turn on compiz
04:11	<Paddy_EIRE>	bazhang: tried it along time ago... originally the "goodbye microsoft" debian installer.. cannot say I am a fan but I suppose its better than ppl not having it :)
04:11	<bazhang>	!pm | mojo
04:11	<ubotu>	mojo: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can also benefit AND help you. Please don't PM a user in the channel without asking first, some find it rude.
04:11	<Pelo>	mojo, no problem but you can see how much helping I'm doing,  I can't get distracted by private msg windows poppiong left and right
04:11	<InGunsWeTrust>	porta-farhan: just boot with the liveCD if it recognizes the keyboard there it will be fine if you install
04:11	<cardstroker>	pelo, not yet, I get a screen full of info with an error in the middle "xf860OpenSerial cannot open device /dev/gpmdata.

04:11	<quadricolour>	Aluminum keyboard works fine at login prompt, after that, u, i, o equals 7, 8, 9. So it knows _something_ about it.
04:11	<quadricolour>	Can I force generic keyboard support?
04:11	<Pelo>	cardstroker, sorry man , that's way over my head I can'T help ,
04:12	<porta-Farhan>	so the numpad fails on the apple keyboard?
04:12]  * Pelo bows his head in shame 
04:12	<thompa>	anyone find easy way to mount walkman?
04:12	<kwame>	http://xti.informatux.net
04:12	<mojo>	Pelo: just was gonna pass on my solution to suppressing join/parts in xchat-gnome is to use the /chanopt command.
04:12	<bjron>	I like how both the upgrade instruction pages (including the one suggested in the topic here) tell you for a cdrom upgrade pop in the alternate cd and follow the instructions.  If it doesn't appear to run gksu "sh /cdrom/cdromupgrade", but the disk doesn't automount at /cdrom/, it mounts at /media/Xubuntu 8.04 amd64 (and of course it just hangs if you try to run it there. . I suspect the spaces in the name just like upgrading to gutsy)
04:12	<LainIwakura>	Pelo: I still can't get the script to work. Searching for perl returns so many packages, I don't know what I need.
04:12	<thompa>	walkman regress from gutsy
04:12	<quadricolour>	Some of the qwerty keys are responding as numbers, no other keys work.
04:12	<bazhang>	kwame: is there a support question related to that link?
04:12	<Pelo>	mojo, ic ,thanks
04:12	<schnootop>	anyone know the best way to setup my gfx card as it couldnt get the drivers for it
04:12	<cardstroker>	pelo, do you know the command to allow me to select video, mouse, and keyboard?
04:12	<porta-Farhan>	hmm strange
04:12	<hmuller>	Anyone know how to ADD a faq in launchpad?
04:12	<InGunsWeTrust>	Has anybody successfully installed zsnes on 64 bit hardy?
04:13	<Pelo>	thompa, what kind of walk man ipod or generic usb flash mp3player ?
04:13	<arvind_k>	LainIwakura, in the source you should have file of requirements read that
04:13	<justme>	can someone help me find where to enable the mic boost ?
04:13	<LainIwakura>	arvind_k: It's just a bash .sh script
04:13	<tcpdumpgod>	Anyone know where I can get a script that'll email me when my servers external IP changes?
04:13	<NetEcho>	Anyone know if DVD playback issues were fixed for some systems?
04:13	<arvind_k>	LainIwakura, where did you get that from
04:13	<thompa>	Pelo: sony is only one
04:13	<cardstroker>	pelo, I was looking for "tasksel"
04:13	<NetEcho>	I know dell laptops had issues with dvd playback in 7.10 which Automatix fixed
04:13	<thompa>	Pelo: lspci says sony
04:13	<arvind_k>	justme, alsamixer
04:13	<porta-Farhan>	is you do a do-release-upgrade in the command line thats basicly like running the update manager right? if I upgrade from gutsy to hardy I wouldn't have to change my apt/sources.list right?
04:14	<kwame>	http://xti.informatux.net
04:14	<kwame>	:)
04:14	<LainIwakura>	arvind_k: It's a conky weather bash script from: http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=37381
04:14	<Pelo>	thompa, doesn' sonny have some weird format it uses for storing files ?
04:14	<bazhang>	InGunsWeTrust: installed from where? the repos
04:14	<bagelong>	josh04:  I am back on the problem machine
04:14	<m1ke_l>	NetEcho:  just joining but i have a dell m1330 with no issues
04:14	<bazhang>	kwame stop that
04:14	<thompa>	Pelo: shows up as unmoutable usb, in gutsy automount
04:14	<osmosis_>	porta-Farhan: right
04:14	<kwame>	bazhang: why?
04:14	<Konedima>	i'm baaaaaack
04:14	<NetEcho>	m1ke_l nice
04:14	<thompa>	Pelo: no
04:14	<Konedima>	both the lines are fine
04:14	<arvind_k>	LainIwakura, ok let me have a look
04:14	<mojo>	Pelo: np.  but for real, you should change the message for your pm refusals to something other than "sorry".  maybe "sorry, pm's are disabled for this user" so the next soul dosn't think you're being asenine.  i thought i was having a conversation with you and i was getting irritated
04:14	<LainIwakura>	arvind_k: The creator says it requires perl and curl, both of which I already have installed. Thanks.
04:14	<thompa>	Pelo: not any more
04:14	<bazhang>	!ot | kwame dont spam here with random links
04:14	<ubotu>	kwame dont spam here with random links: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
04:14	<NetEcho>	m1ke_l wait did it come with ubuntu (Dell opensource line) ?
04:14	<kwame>	bazhang: I'm not flooding, am I?
04:14	<porta-Farhan>	changing the apt/sources.list will break stuff
04:14	<Pelo>	thompa, try looking up the model in the forum www.ubuntuforums.org or maybe try with amarok I know it works with ipods
04:14	<m1ke_l>	NetEcho: no the ubuntu version was $500 more!
04:14	<InGunsWeTrust>	bazhang: I mean at all! haha I can't find a 64 bit package and if i --force-architecture it doesnt work
04:15	<thompa>	Pelo: its drag and drop. i just checked its a new bug
04:15	<quadricolour>	Oddly, the aluminum kbd's media and eject keys work.
04:15	<ethana2>	so when does the first round of bugfix updates roll out?
04:15	<m1ke_l>	dell does not really support linux like they claim
04:15	<NetEcho>	m1ke_l wtf?
04:15	<justme>	there is nothing in there about mic boost
04:15	<NetEcho>	they make you pay for a free option :@
04:15	<porta-Farhan>	the eject butons work. wow
04:15	<josh04>	bagelong: okay. can you give me the line from lspci which refers to broadcom again?
04:15	<m1ke_l>	NetEcho:  it's retarded
04:15	<NetEcho>	m1ke_l is this 8.04 you're running?
04:15	<Pelo>	thompa, well untill it gets fixed there isnT' muich I can do
04:15	<thompa>	Pelo: i just want to hear my walkman
04:15	<m1ke_l>	is now...dist-upgraded 2 days ago
04:15	<dredhammer>	i cannot get hardy to recognize my monitor with the nvidia closed drivers its a Smasung monitor
04:15	<porta-Farhan>	are the alt and command keys reversed still like they are in windows?
04:15	<m1ke_l>	compiz issues, but otherwise fine
04:15	<ethana2>	nvidia drivers are borked
04:15	<bagelong>	josh04:  0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4310 USB Controller
04:15	<dredhammer>	*samsung
04:15	<thompa>	Pelo: i have a 64 partion on one box and it mounts
04:15	<NetEcho>	m1ke_l k cause 7.10 doesn't have playback for my Inspiron
04:16	<edwin>	does anyone know of a good mic config tool?
04:16	<m1ke_l>	ethana2: was that for me?
04:16	<ethana2>	dredhammer: hardy broke the nvidia proprietary drivers
04:16	<ethana2>	yes
04:16	<carlosdias>	hello
04:16	<ethana2>	wait, it's for anyone
04:16	<Pelo>	thompa, I understand but if you checked and there is a recent bug you will have to wait , or ... try mounting it with sudo mount /dev/.... /mountpoint
04:16	<m1ke_l>	nvidia issues with hardy...that would explain it
04:16	<bazhang>	InGunsWeTrust: oh right; 64 bit--you could possibly create a chrooted 32 bit environment for that--at least that is what I have heard smarter people suggest
04:16	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: they still don't end up in trashcan btw :P with just "sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash && ln -s ~/.local/share/Trash/files".. gotta do it every time I wanna free up some space :S
04:16	<apallo>	I can't get my wireless working properly in hardy
04:16	<ethana2>	noveau come quickly!
04:16	<ethana2>	apallo: what brand?
04:16	<dredhammer>	so i am stuck in bad 2d rendering mode ethana2?
04:16	<josh04>	bagelong: is there a similar line in lsusb?
04:16	<Drezard>	apallo, is it a 1501 Dell?
04:16	<InGunsWeTrust>	bazhang: I have no idea what that means :)
04:16	<carlosdias>	alquem mode me ensinar a atualizar o gusty para o hardy ??
04:16	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, where do they end up ?
04:16	<NetEcho>	is there any ATI issues in hardy?
04:16	<ethana2>	dredhammer: until the first bugfixes perhaps
04:16	<edwin>	funny, hardy fixed my wifi, which was buggy in gusty
04:16	<apallo>	it's an IBM t60
04:16	<adiabatty>	Can I enlarge an xubuntu partition if I decide to delete the Windows partition before it?
04:16	<dredhammer>	i wish i ahd an ati card
04:16	<ethana2>	apallo: the wireless?
04:17	<ethana2>	edwin: same here
04:17	<dredhammer>	*had
04:17	<enaner>	my sound thing doesnt work
04:17	<NetEcho>	dredhammer why?
04:17	<Drezard>	Is there anyway to get a bare bone version of ubuntu 8.04, no programs installed, just the GNOME desktop and the backend?
04:17	<thompa>	Pelo:tried that, you have to add  it to fstab, but i think only read only works
04:17	<m1ke_l>	apallo my t60p runs gutsy just fine

04:17	<arvind_k>	LainIwakura, ok does the terminal give any error when you run the script
04:17	<bazhang>	InGunsWeTrust: neither do I really; just an idea that some have seemed to use in that situation
04:17	<apallo>	it uses the proprietary driver in gutsy, butwon't connect properly in hardy
04:17	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: think it's in ~/.Trash
04:17	<ethana2>	Drezard: JeOS
04:17	<enaner>	my volume thing dont work
04:17	<porta-Farhan>	i wish I had working in wifi
04:17	<dredhammer>	fullscreen video playback is just terrible
04:17	<USN1520_>	b166erx I got booted...how are you aking out
04:17	<Pelo>	adiabatty, you'll have to move the xubuntu partion and then enlarge it , you can only stretch after , not before , if you get me
04:17	<USN1520_>	making
04:17	<ethana2>	Drazard: or ubuntu server
04:17	<darkcrab>	does hardy heron come with firefox 2 and firefox 3, because I just looked at my menu and I have firefox 2 but I never installed it?
04:17	<josh04>	bagelong: is there a wlan0 in iwconfig?
04:17	<apallo>	it detects ok, but it wont connect to my AP
04:17	<Konedima>	hey pelo i checked both the lines are fine
04:17	<NetEcho>	dredhammer ATI cards actually have more issues in linux than nVidia
04:17	<m1ke_l>	ethana2: would you suggest getting nvidia driver direct to fix?
04:17	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash && ln -s ~/.Trash ~/.local/share/Trash/files    ?
04:17	<adiabatty>	Pelo: good 'nuff, thanks.
04:17	<ubuntung-pinoy>	darkcrab: 3 only
04:18	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, It should just have FF3
04:18	<Sl4y3r>	anyone know how to update from 8.04 alpha 6 to 8.04 lts?
04:18	<ethana2>	M1ke_I : i don't know if that would help
04:18	<bagelong>	josh04:  any help on answering your question?
04:18	<USN1520_>	b166erx looks like your card is supported by ALSA
04:18	<porta-Farhan>	what is the beter method to use with a broadcom wireless card, ndiswrapper or the bxm other thing
04:18	<darkcrab>	how could I have possibly gotten firefox 2 then?
04:18	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, well right now, anything goign to ~./Trash,  should end up in ~/.local/share/Trash/files
04:18	<Paddy_EIRE>	darkcrab: if you upgraded from gutsy you will have both oddly..
04:18	<InGunsWeTrust>	bazhang: actually to tell the truth i tried to do it once but it just gave me a headache and eventually didnt work anyway. And it did all kinds of annoying things like break some 64 bit packages that were working before haha
04:18	<USN1520_>	sl4y3r just use update manager
04:18	<mojo>	NetEcho: i have had a helluva time getting dual-head working right with hardy and ati's fglrx driver.  gave up for now.  maybe the 'ati' foss driver would be better for me after all.
04:18	<quadricolour>	system ->	admin ->	update manager
04:18	<LainIwakura>	arvind_k: Yes, it says ~/.conky/weather.sh: Permission denied!!! Let me try chmod a+rw weather.sh. Is that right?
04:18	<darkcrab>	but I didnt????
04:18	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, Does FF2 open when you click it in the menu?
04:18	<bazhang>	Sl4y3r: just keep updating and you will get there
04:18	<m1ke_l>	darkcrab: i think theres a "backport" for ff2 in hardy
04:18	<Konedima>	although the first line refers to (hd1,0) or something like that... my unofficial uneducated opinion says theres a chance that could be wrong
04:18	<bagelong>	josh04:  I am sorry I am very new at this.  I do not know the terminal commands very well at all as you can tell.
04:18	<darkcrab>	yes it does
04:18]  * mojo is also wondering what happened to emerald in hardy?
04:18	<Pelo>	Konedima, that,s all I had
04:18	<arvind_k>	LainIwakura, that should chmod a+x
04:18	<NetEcho>	mojo I haven't installed hardy yet
04:18	<Sl4y3r>	( Operating System ) Linux Ubuntu 8.04 - hardy Kernel: 2.6.24-16-generic, GNU/Linux | Xorg: 1.4.0.90 | Desktop: Fluxbox 1.0.0  | IRC CLient: X-Chat v.2.8.4
04:18	<doug2266778822>	what program can i use to burn movies to dvd something like convert x to dvd but will work in linux and not wine.
04:18	<NetEcho>	I've been a little too out of it on my new prescription drugs
04:19	<Sl4y3r>	so i might be there?
04:19	<Pelo>	doug2266778822, devede
04:19	<b166erx>	USN1520_   still trying to make sense out of this bug.    yep. And I always worked on Alsa too.. Altough for a few month    only 2/3 boot
04:19	<mojo>	NetEcho: what kind of set-up you have now?
04:19	<bazhang>	mojo perhaps that would be best answered in #compiz-fusion
04:19	<darkcrab>	and my start page in ff3 just changed all of a sudden.
04:19	<TelnetManta>	Anyone had troubles with Nvidia drivers in Hardy?
04:19	<LainIwakura>	arvind_k: Thank you so much. It works now!
04:19	<ethana2>	TelnetManta: yes.
04:19	<josh04>	bagelong: type iwconfig into the terminal
04:19	<seamus7>	Sl4y3r .. you are likely there ... check System Monitor for your version
04:19	<darkcrab>	it use to go to one place and now it goes to another ubuntu place.
04:19	<josh04>	it should produe several paragraphs
04:19	<darkcrab>	but the address is the same
04:19	<s|k_>	hi, why is trackered eating al of my cpu for no reason?
04:19	<NetEcho>	mojo for ubuntu its on my Dell Inspiron which although is a gaming laptop, its my work laptop
04:19	<TelnetManta>	ethana2: Any solutions?
04:19	<arvind_k>	LainIwakura, thats ok nm
04:19	<USN1520_>	b166erx, the alsa website has instructions for compiling the driver
04:19	<Sl4y3r>	isays 8.04 hardy
04:19	<Sl4y3r>	will it say alpha if if is
04:19	<TelnetManta>	trying to get desktop effects to work with an 8800 card
04:19	<ethana2>	TelnetManta: update
04:19	<bagelong>	josh04:lo        no wireless extensions.
04:19	<bagelong>	eth0      no wireless extensions.
04:19	<mojo>	bazhang: maybe if it were a problem with compiz or emerald.  i mean, did UBUNTU decide not to ship emerald with compiz on the default setup for some reason?  is emerald being deprecated?
04:19	<seamus7>	slk_ it's indexing .. you can turn tracker off or just throttle it down in its preferences
04:19	<josh04>	bagelong: one called lo, one called eth0 and possibly one called wlan0
04:19	<Pelo>	ok , I'm done for tonight , best of luck to everyone, don'T dispair,  getting away from MS is hard but it's worth it
04:20	<Konedima>	pelo, the first line in the boot thing refers to (hd1,0), which i think could be wrong cause c:\ is the secondary master
04:20	<s|k_>	seamus7: thanks
04:20	<ethana2>	TelnetManta: in other words, not yet
04:20	<josh04>	bagelong: apparently not :P
04:20	<USN1520_>	sl4y3r not sure I understand the ?
04:20	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: well since the rm command is working, that's where they end up.. sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash && ln -s ~/.local/share/Trash/files   but how the ln command works... is another issue
04:20	<dredhammer>	not as bad as this NetEcho the only problem i had with ATI was getting compiz-fusion to work with the closed drivers
04:20	<bazhang>	!info emerald hardy

04:20	<Naxos10>	Hello... utter newbie Q: Trying to use NVidia X Server Settings to set up dual monitors. One mon works OK and Twin View works OK, but when I enable the second monitor and try to save the config I get "Unable to create X config backup" --- do I need special permissions to create this backup file?  thank you!
04:20	<mojo>	Konedima: remember GRUB numbers disks hd0, hd1, etc...
04:20	<Pelo>	Konedima,   hd1,0 means the second hdd first partition the numbering in grub starts with 0
04:20	<Paddy_EIRE>	PhilcoBill: you get free cake with it
04:20	<NetEcho>	dredhammer the big issue is ATI really doesn't want anything to do with linux drivers and nvidia has always supplied drivers
04:20	<Sl4y3r>	sorry
04:20	<ubuntung-pinoy>	!ask | edwin
04:20	<ubotu>	edwin: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
04:20	<b166erx>	brb
04:20	<s|k_>	oh trackered is probably doing this because I just checked out a lot of files from a repository
04:20	<Sl4y3r>	will the gnome-system-monitor say alpha if it is alpha?
04:20	<Konedima>	oh ok

04:21	<NetEcho>	dredhammer although the ati drivers are getting better and hopefully both parties will poor more effort into them
04:21	<Konedima>	should i try setting it to 0 on the off chance it'll do something?
04:21	<Jordan_U>	NetEcho, And intel has always provided open source drivers and documentation :)
04:21	<cardstroker>	pelo, I use a USB mouse, /dev/gpmdata did not work, which should I choose, dev/input/mice, or psaux or ttyS0, tts0?
04:21	<bazhang>	Sl4y3r: sounds like you have final judging by the kernel version
04:21	<ubuntung-pinoy>	edwin: are u on hardy?
04:21	<NetEcho>	Jordan_U thats because intel has brains :P
04:21	<bagelong>	josh04: have I worn you out?
04:21	<bazhang>	doug2266778822: you might try devede
04:21	<josh04>	bagelong: can you type lshw -C network? don't copy it here, put it on pastebin
04:21	<Pelo>	Pingviller_, you should only run that command once,    rm -rf ~/.Trash  removed your old trash folder,   the nst part creates a link from your where you old trash was to where the new trash is , so anything send to the old trash goes t the new one ,  you donT, need to keep running hat command
04:21	<USN1520_>	sl4y3r no, I believe it should change...but make sure you have installed all available upgrades
04:22	<edwin>	ubuntung-pinoy: yes, but it didn't work in gusty either
04:22	<NetEcho>	most hardware companies are starting to realise Windows isn't the only viable solution these days
04:22	<josh04>	bagelong: It's getting late, but we're not far off I don't think :P
04:22	<Pelo>	cardstroker, no idea, I donT' have usb devices here except for flash drives
04:22	<bagelong>	josh04:  I am sorry, this is my first time on.  How do I use pastbin
04:22	<mojo>	bazhang: nm i know it's there just thought it was a decision at some level to not configure it as part of the default install for desktop effects.  turning them all on in gutsy would give you emerald, if you didn't check the "use metacity themes" box in GL Desktop settings
04:22	<NetEcho>	especialy with the mainstreaming of user friendly linux distros
04:22	<Sl4y3r>	ok
04:22	<seamus7>	Sl4y3r it likely just says 8.04 ... you are updated
04:22	<ubuntung-pinoy>	edwin: do u remember it working in any other OS?
04:22	<edwin>	ubuntung-pinoy: neither skype nor etqw are detecting that I even have a mic
04:22	<pawan>	hi
04:22	<Pelo>	ok good night for real now ,
04:22	<TropicalDude>	Do i just ask thing here?
04:22	<USN1520_>	see you Pelo

04:22	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: aye
04:22	<arvind_k>	pawan, hi
04:22	<Pingviller_>	Pelo: actually I do.. since it didn't make them to go to the new trash, they still end up in the same place
04:22	<TropicalDude>	great, thank you
04:23	<edwin>	ubuntung-pinoy: yes, the vista that came preinstalled on this computer
04:23	<dredhammer>	yes NetEcho ati has crappy closed source drivers but i was expecting with nvidia things would be better to run into two bugs so far using the nvidia drivers is a bit unsettling
04:23	<VousDeux>	oh, haha...I guess this is the right channel
04:23	<enaner>	y does the screen go black when i fullscreen something?
04:23	<NetEcho>	dredhammer the ones that come with Hardy?
04:23	<mojo>	bazhang: turning them all on to max-bling in ubuntu's Appearance control panel in hardy does not bring emerald with it.  just wondered if there was a reason behind that decision, like maybe there is another direction planned.
04:23	<enaner>	and why are my graphics messing up?
04:23	<carlosdias>	join #planeta-ubuntu-brasil
04:23	<cardstroker>	I use USB mouse, which mouse device should I select, /dev/input/mice, or psaux, or ttyS0, or tts0 or gpmdata?
04:23	<Sl4y3r>	ive never had any probs with the graphics
04:23	<mojo>	bazhang: but it is not of any pressing concern.  just being chatty w/my thoughts
04:23	<Sl4y3r>	;s
04:23	<bazhang>	mojo the compiz channel could likely clear that up
04:23	<ubuntung-pinoy>	enaner: do u have proprietary drivers in use?
04:23	<newbie8dot04>	on hardy, how do I mount my ntfs drives?
04:23	<arbir>	is back into IRC
04:23	<rnstux>	hola!
04:23	<NetEcho>	I would expect hardy has a few bugs that need hammering out
04:24	<NetEcho>	should be fine by next week tho
04:24	<dredhammer>	yep i can't get proper 3d with the closed drivers
04:24	<TropicalDude>	Im new to Ubuntu, just update to 8.10 last days and the problem is, just see one CPU/CORE under system monitor

04:29	<TropicalDude>	ok, so because I dont really know how to update to generic kernel and my system is kinda messy Im going to make a fresh install, so my new question is, should I HAVE to use 64bit to have dual core or the generic hardy x86 will work fine?
04:29	<oddalot>	no, i like xmms because it's like oldschool winamp, i am only use to that
04:29	<ubuntung-pinoy>	ï»¿ruewan: try unlock
04:29	<saltedlight>	thanks ubuntung-pinoy, i'l check these...
04:30	<InGunsWeTrust>	ruewan: if you are using 8.04 try unlock
04:30	<Boohbah>	oddalot: yeah but amarok lets you search huge collections much faster

04:30	<ruewan>	ok that worked
04:30	<oddalot>	boobah, i don't have any huge collections
04:30	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: no need; the generic 32bit is fine; do a search in synaptic

04:35	<gaspipe1>	Assid: ok
04:35	<darkcrab>	mophead my problem is it is installed in my applications and I dont remember it being there, and I am concerned.
04:35	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: and then you can upgrade from synaptic
04:35	<seamus7>	darkcrab ... it is not ... did you upgrade? maybe you had installed FF2 in a separate location?
04:35	<InGunsWeTrust>	TropicalDude: if you wanna use zsnes dont do 64 bit! AH!
04:35	<Arno>	can someone please tell me how to add Shadows behind windows in Compiz?
04:35	<jmknsd_>	netyire: cat /proc/cpuinfo
04:35	<jmknsd_>	my bad
04:35	<Assid>	zsnes ?
04:35	<Alex_Sc2e>	I would not go with 64 Bit: Programs have major issues, also many bugs come up. I had it on my other PC, and it was horribel
04:35	<darkcrab>	No seamus I did not  upgrade.
04:35	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: so i wud have to reinstall it?
04:36	<TropicalDude>	Assid: I got 3GB ram
04:36	<darkcrab>	This is a fresh install
04:36	<Assid>	people play snes roms yet?
04:36	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, Do you have the firefox-2 package installed?
04:36	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: no real need for 64 bit at this point; very few apps and many things can be more work to get going
04:36	<darkcrab>	Jordan_1 yes , but I did not install it, thats the problem
04:36	<tuchki>	hi. someone have a ati radeon express 200 installed correctly?
04:36	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: if it's not a fresh install then no. you just need to make sure you have the hardy repos for it so you can update when needed
04:36	<Wyzard>	What is the "nvidia_new" driver?  How's it different from the regular "nvidia" driver?
04:36	<m2geek>	tuchki nope, i have a 9600 pro that works :)
04:36	<seamus7>	darkcrab where do you see FF2? how did you become aware of it being on your fresh install of Hardy?
04:36	<mophead>	Arno: I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find just by googling "compiz"
04:36	<netyire>	jmknsd_: thanks! any clue as to how to determine if its a prescott, northwood, etc from the make and stepping though?
04:36	<enaner>	how do i enable proprietary drivers
04:36	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i upgraded so now it wasn't a fresh install
04:36	<mophead>	http://www.google.com/search?q=compiz&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a
04:36	<darkcrab>	It showed up in my applications list seamus7
04:36	<InGunsWeTrust>	TropicalDude: typically with 64 bit you get about 15% better CPU performance but use about 15% more RAM
04:37	<tuchki>	mine is not workin good
04:37	<tuchki>	i cant change resolution
04:37	<Assid>	Alex_Sc2e: what kinda issues?
04:37	<netyire>	enaner: system ->	administration ->	hardware drivers
04:37	<bazhang>	!binarydrivers | enaner
04:37	<ubotu>	enaner: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
04:37	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, You can safely remove it if you want to, one possability I can think of is that you installed a package containing a firefox plugin which depends on FF2
04:37	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: how do i check to make sure i have the repos?
04:37	<cvd-pr>	any now how i adjust the  brigthness in VLC?
04:37	<josh04>	bagelong: type "sudo ndiswrapper -a 14e4:4315 bcmwl5"
04:37	<m2geek>	are proprietary drivers much point? I tried em once and it totally screwed things up for me.
04:37	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: do you know what /etc/apt/sources.list is?
04:37	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: I think because Im a n00b I will put 64bit on stand by, so now I have to 1) fresh install 2) Figure out to make work dual core.
04:37	<darkcrab>	OK jordan_1, I will check that now.
04:37	<seamus7>	darkcrab: how do you know it's FF2?
04:37	<darkcrab>	It says firefox 2 seamus 7
04:37	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: why re-install?
04:38	<jmknsd_>	netyire: nope
04:38	<Wyzard>	TropicalDude: You shouldn't need to do anything for your dual-core to work
04:38	<agmishra>	How do I add myself for sharing allowed user in hardy?
04:38	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: the 32bit binaries dont work on 64bit for zsnes?
04:38	<bagelong>	josh04: This is safe _only_ if driver bcmwl5 is meant for chip in device 14E4:4315
04:38	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ahh i think so... is that the list where it shows ubuntu where to find updates?
04:38	<seamus7>	darkcrab is FF3 there as well?
04:38	<bazhang>	Wyzard: he has the 386 (not generic ) kernel
04:38	<josh04>	bagelong: it is
04:38	<Wyzard>	ah
04:38	<Dr_willis>	TropicalDude,  check what kernel you are running also. I noticed on one machne i somehow had the 386 kernel installed when i needed the -generic kernel.
04:38	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: because I cant see dual activity CPU
04:38	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: yup either check that file or the medibuntu file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
04:38	<Assid>	Wyzard: not about makin it work.. but just  performs better
04:38	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: if it says gutsy, change it to hardy
04:38	<Gun_Smoke>	What's the name of package to add the temp sensors to the panel?
04:38	<bagelong>	josh04:  Looks like we are close.  Now what?
04:38	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ok
04:38	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: install the generic kernel then
04:38	<agmishra>	when I want to share something, the dialog says I don't have permission to share
04:39	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: nope i found a 32 bit deb and did --force-architecture on it but it doesnt work
04:39	<josh04>	bagelong: "ndiswrapper -l"
04:39	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: then if any update is available you'll just get it through synaptic
04:39	<bjron>	lol, good thing I DL the xubuntu alt install disk - probably not a good plan to upgrade my ubuntu install from that :p
04:39	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: how :)? from synaptic?
04:39	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: strange.. technically 32 bit binaries should work on it
04:39	<LoLeN_Original>	i had downloaded some packages (a LOT) from another computer, and then burnt them to a cd having used AptonCD; then i installed them at another system; and now Synaptic tells me that all of them are autoremovable. How can i fix it so that they are shown just installed?
04:40	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: that would be best choice yes--be sure it is the 24 and not the 22 however (if this is an upgrade and not a fresh install)
04:40	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: i know! that is why this problem is particularly annoying. zsnes is the only program that I want that i cant use! otherwise I love hardy (as I have loved every upgrade of ubuntu)
04:40	<bazhang>	LoLeN_Original: this is gutsy or hardy
04:40	<bagelong>	josh04:  "driver installed"  device (14E4:4315 present).
04:40	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: what is the cmd to get the list?
04:40	<LoLeN_Original>	bazhung: hardy :D :D
04:40	<josh04>	bagelong: "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
04:40	<Jordan_U>	LoLeN_Original, I believe if you run "sudo apt-get install <list of packages>" they will no longer be considered "orphaned" packages
04:40	<darkcrab>	seamus7 I can use firefox2 and firefox3 as seperate browsers.
04:41	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust:  you filed a bug in launchpad?
04:41	<bazhang>	LoLeN_Original: and the aptoncd was from a gutsy system?
04:41	<LoLeN_Original>	bazhang: nop, hardy too
04:41	<darkcrab>	Jordan, there is nothing there to indicate that I installed a firefox2 plugin.

04:41	<Geoffrey2>	is there a Heron specific set of instructions for getting wireless up and running?

04:42	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: nope, cuz it isnt a bug, there have been seperate 32 and 64 bit packages for zsnes since 6.10 I figured there was just something about the program that made it had to be specially compiled

04:42	<LoLeN_Original>	bazhang: are you looking at it?
04:42	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: so that would make it a bug.. if its working in the past versions and now doesnt

04:42	<swilky>	XD
04:42	<seamus7>	darkcrab did you do a fresh install but keep your home folder from a previous installation separate in its own partition?
04:42	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid; good point
04:43	<darkcrab>	no seamus7, this is an absolute default fresh install.

04:53	<pokerfacepenguin>	ubuntung-pinoy: sounds like you are already commited.   been a while...u can probably do a google search to get a howto....basically, just point your repos to a different location...especially a more local one
04:53	<bazhang>	eaglestar83: no need; just keep updating an d you will be final
04:54	<regis>	Wyzard: ah ok so install it...i used envyng manual installation...
04:54	<eaglestar83>	yeah ok why is firefox working crazy now sometimes i have to send kill to close it
04:54	<Jordan_U>	ubuntung-pinoy, Are you trying to find a faster apt mirror?
04:54	<Wyzard>	regis: Actually, all I did was "sudo apt-get update"
04:54	<tuchki>	somebody know how to configure a grafic card ati radeon express 200 in hardy?
04:54	<bazhang>	eaglestar83: how many extensions you using; how many flash tabs, etc
04:54	<eaglestar83>	i had madwifi patch do i have to reinstall any patches or drivers that i made
04:55	<eaglestar83>	no extensions
04:55	<Wyzard>	regis: then re-open the hardware drivers window, and it works as expected (shows the nVidia driver not-enabled until I click on it, and then installs the driver package)
04:55	<neztiti>	guys how i can access root files on hardy 8.04???
04:55	<josh04>	bagelong: gah. can you pastebin me "lshw -C network"

04:55	<ruewan>	ubuntu is the most popular linux distro but everyone still releases there packages in rpms with creating a deb

04:56	<bazhang>	ruewan: that is not correct
04:56	<Assid>	someone wanna help me with ppp dialer
04:56	<regis>	could someone tell me how do i install a module and how can i know the path of a module i modprobe
04:56	<Jordan_U>	ubuntung-pinoy, System ->	Administration ->	Software Sources ...
04:56	<Wyzard>	regis: You don't need to modprobe nvidia_new manually

04:57	<bagelong>	josh04: http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d28382d8a
04:57	<Wyzard>	neztiti: use sudo
04:57	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: try'n to remeber if there was something else i should update lol
04:57	<Jordan_U>	ubuntung-pinoy, Download from ->	Choose other, then click "select best server"
04:57	<regis>	Wyzard: i need to do it automaticaly but it modprobes the wrong nvidia driver
04:57	<Odd-rationale>	!sudo | neztiti
04:57	<ubotu>	neztiti: sudo is a command to run programs with superuser privileges ("root"). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information.
04:57	<bazhang>	neztiti: you should use sudo not su
04:57	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: np
04:57	<seamus7>	neztiti: root files are in the File System or / .. open Nautilus and File System will be listed in the sidebar

04:57	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: i only had wine as a 3rd party repo besides medibuntu
04:58	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: hey i have wine too
04:58	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: but the new wine broke a lot of stuff for me, so i decided to deinstall it
04:58	<Karshin>	Question, I tried to login as root, but ubuntu doesnÂ´t allows me to do it, says "You canÂ´t login as root from here" how I can log in as a root?
04:58	<bazhang>	jsoftw logging in as root? and on irc as root? that is perhaps a really bad choice
04:58	<Darkside>	ok, hai, i've refined my problem a bit: my laptop only charges the battery when its turned off
04:58	<Wyzard>	regis: wrong driver?
04:58	<Darkside>	when i boot into ubuntu, it doesn't charge
04:58	<Wyzard>	Karshin: You can't because you shouldn't
04:58	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: should i leave it as is then?
04:58	<eaglestar83>	ok the sound doesn't work in totem when i have firefox open and youtube movie stopped
04:58	<seamus7>	if you want to edit root files with gedit I recommend doing 'gksudo gedit pathtofile'
04:58	<jsoftw>	bazhang: who said anything about irc as root, or logging in as root.
04:58	<neil_d>	Karshin: you need to use sudo
04:58	<bazhang>	Karshin: you should just not do that--especially on irc
04:58	<josh04>	bagelong: try "sudo ndiswrapper -mi" and "sudo ndiswrapper -ma", followed by "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper"
04:58	<ubuntung-pinoy>	Jordan_U: that's in the Applications >	Add/Rermove ?
04:58	<Skuller>	hey guys, I just managed to install dansguardian to filter out porn from being accessed on the web. But how do I configure it to filter out porn from the web?
04:58	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: gutsy had 0.9.58, hardy has 0.9.59, winehq has 0.9.60. 0.9.58 works great for me, the other two don't
04:59	<bazhang>	jsoftw: my mistake; anticipating Karshin's question I guess ;]
04:59	<eaglestar83>	how can i run multiple sound applications at same time i have to close firefox many times if i want to play something in totem
04:59	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: i put the package on hold and manually installed 0.9.58
04:59	<seamus7>	oops neztiti if you want to edit root files I recommend doing 'gksudo gedit pathtofile'
04:59	<regis>	Wyzard: yes...when it startx it goes in failsafe mode unless i insmod nvidia_new manualy
04:59	<Karshin>	The reason I want to log in as root is for not having to write the password each time I want to do something, like access my hd
04:59	<Jordan_U>	ubuntung-pinoy, No, from the main menu ( it will affect where Add / Remove downloads from though )
04:59	<Karshin>	specially if Im offline
04:59	<Wyzard>	hmm, font hinting isn't as nice in 8.04 as in previous releases
04:59	<Darknezz>	im logged in to my account and want to add files to a folder that is protected. how can i login to root and add the files. do i have to do it through terminal orr is there another way?
04:59	<jsoftw>	Karshin: just su - to root.
04:59	<bazhang>	Skuller: dansguardian as well as a firefox plugin for that
04:59	<Karshin>	so I would have access to all files and services

05:00	<bazhang>	jsoftw: please do not recommend that to new users thanks
05:00	<Karshin>	Poliykit?
05:00	<jsoftw>	Karshin: sudo passwd root, then you can su - to root, and get a proper shell.

05:01	<Ooglez>	Sorry to add to the chaos, but how well does Hardy Heron do with wifi drivers out of the box, specifically with broadcom chips?

05:02	<Vlet>	d4t4min3r: what are you trying to play?
05:02	<Ooglez>	Regis: Would I get that from broadcom? And do they even release firmware for linux?

05:03	<Karshin>	Most dialup modems are not supported by Ubuntu, but drivers can be found that will enable the use of such modems. First you need to identify what chipset your dialup modem is using:

05:04	<seamus7>	Luckrider: you are likely already in the final release ..

05:09	<Flannel>	Karshin: its only when you want to do something administrative.  Which, may seem like a lot right now, but once you've had your OS for a month or so, you'll hardly ever.

05:10	<dsas>	(or do-release-update rather)
05:10	<mndar>	any suggestions ?
05:10	<Luckrider>	that is what I want, thatnks vlet
05:10	<seamus7>	karllenz I believe it is recommended that you use the Testing Package for AWN ...
05:10	<Vlet>	mndar: easy, put one arm above the other, then loop
05:10	<bazhang>	roocraig: more info please
05:10	<karllenz>	ï»¿seamus7: how do i do that?
05:10	<Karshin>	I wonder. by any chance there might be a script, or a program which would automatically set up the password each time its requiered?

05:11	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, Just a quick question: If I use "dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/home/hda1.bin" to back it up will that follow symlinks? Or will it just back up the symlink as the file itself?
05:11	<ms_>	j
05:11	<dsas>	bazhang: Yes, that's the one. Any idea why you still have to pass it the -d flag?

05:22	<slaytanic>	CaptainMorgan: No prob, I installed it to see what version it was.
05:22	<Nikonlappy>	TWP-SirStaal: you can also do "top"
05:22	<bazhang>	shally87: you installed successfully? you know the kernel version?
05:22	<Zelta>	Bassoon: What program did you use to write it?
05:22	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: ok, I don't know what to do from here.  have you a '/etc/init.d' directory
05:22	<Bassoon>	The default one.
05:22	<chicobo329>	I have a beta of Hardy but it won't update to the final version through the update manager because it keeps saying it's up to date. Is it possible to upgrade through another means?

05:22	<jamiejackson>	haha, yeah, neil_d
05:23	<seamus7>	chicobo329 it didn't lie ... you are up to date
05:23	<jaffarkelshac>	shally87, stop saying, help me, help me just ask your question all in one go with as much information as possible describing the problem
05:23	<CaptainMorgan>	slaytanic, 6.1 was supposed to be out today... I think it may be pushed to next week.. would Add/Remove also update this ?
05:23	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329, if is uptodate then is uptodate
05:23	<PuPpY1334>	Xubuntu fiesty, what do I need to do to have xdmcp login in the login menu ?

05:23	<Zelta>	Bassoon: Wait, you wrote the .iso in Windows or in Ubuntu?
05:23	<chicobo329>	just a sec
05:23	<Bassoon>	Zelta, Ubuntu.

05:23	<karllenz>	i need this repository and i cant put it into the apt line http://ppa.launchpad.net/ipod-touch/ubuntu/dists/hardy/main/binary-i386/
05:23	<Bassoon>	Zelta, Yes.
05:24	<Zelta>	Bassoon: Why not just upgrade regularly?
05:24	<Makgyver>	hey, there is a clue for me, if I burn my ISO in Windows for the PowerPC will it fail? should I use Mac OS to burn the CD?
05:24	<slaytanic>	CaptainMorgan: Probably not.
05:24	<karllenz>	its for ipod convienence
05:24	<bazhang>	shally87: you said it was successful but you cannot get into it? you know that has no desktop right?
05:24	<shally87>	bazhang: i dont really sure what the kernel edition are.. i'm new in this
05:24	<Bassoon>	Zelta, I figured that I needed it for later.
05:24	<Bassoon>	Also, I didn't have the time?
05:24	<roocraig>	bazhang: I can't get back to the desktop--running hardy 8.04

05:24	<Jiggah>	anyone got a solution for the "no root file system is defined" when installing from wubi
05:24	<Zelta>	Bassoon: Time?  It is a lot faster to upgrade regularly than to reinstall / upgrade from a CD
05:24	<cvd-pr>	check in system-monitor chicobo329
05:24	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: ok, I am feeling my way here.  cd to it, and have a look at the file names, these are the scripts that start different things at init time.
05:24	<Zelta>	And you need the alt. CD to do it, I think
05:24	<Bassoon>	Huh.
05:24	<chicobo329>	gotcha
05:25	<cvd-pr>	system
05:25	<Bassoon>	Zelta, I'll try that soon.

05:25	<ubotu>	Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. You can search https://help.ubuntu.com or http://wiki.ubuntu.com while you wait. Also see !patience
05:25	<jamiejackson>	neil_d: someone told me these were for services (implying services *only*), is that not true?
05:25	<chicobo329>	it says Release 8.04 (hardy)
05:25	<Nikonlappy>	pawan: you log out.. then log back in with the new username
05:25	<MrRoboto>	I have an external drive that always mounted .... now for some reason it just wont mount ... it just appears in Computer as USB Drive ... any ideas to mount it ???
05:25	<bazhang>	shally87: youknow the server has no gui right?
05:25	<Bassoon>	I'm also have problems getting Ubuntu to sense my headphone jack as filled.
05:25	<Oleg_>	which one is install only?
05:26	<chicobo329>	but when I boot up I still get the (development branch) boot options when on GRUB
05:26	<bazhang>	the alternate one Oleg_
05:26	<Bassoon>	I can put the headphones in, but sound will still come out of the speakers AND the headphones.
05:26	<seamus7>	pawan go to System / Quit then choose Log Out ... enter new user's username and password .... voila
05:26	<shally87>	bazhang: so sorry but i dont really know what gui are..and i just downloaded the server version to learn something new..i got no basic in this..
05:26	<keycool1>	bazhang did you see my paste?
05:26	<Makgyver>	can I do a network install for PowerPC?
05:26	<JPSmon>	is anyone good with Broken Packages??
05:26	<nano_>	hey guys, what is good gui program to burn iso bootable images?
05:26	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  you do the partial-upgrade?
05:26	<Millertime_018>	hey how do i log in as root
05:26	<Millertime_018>	?
05:26	<Makgyver>	I can place the ISO on my lan somewhere
05:26	<Nikonlappy>	shally87: you should use the desktop.. the server by default does not have a guy ( the pretey desktop look)
05:27	<Nikonlappy>	shally87: gui = graphical user interface
05:27	<chicobo329>	partial-upgrade from what?
05:27	<xim>	if I backup my home dir and then reinstall linux and copy the home folder back in, will I need to manually reinstall all the packages, or is there a list of installed packages saved somewhere in the home dir that can be restored all at once?
05:27	<leo_rockw>	Millertime_018: if you need to ask, you shouldn't be doing it
05:27	<seamus7>	nano_ I think I use K3B ... just choose the slowest burn settings
05:27	<bazhang>	shally87: then you should get the desktop version--no gui means no shiny buttons etc to click but have to enter everything is a dos-like environment (the command line or cli)
05:27	<Nikonlappy>	!root | Millertime_018
05:27	<ubotu>	Millertime_018: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
05:27	<Ooglez>	Millertime_018: Ubuntu prevents it to protect you from messing things up. use a command like sudo if you need root access
05:27	<bazhang>	Millertime_018: very bad idea
05:27	<nano_>	seamus7: K3B...is that kde app?
05:27	<roocraig>	bazhang: what do you think I should do?
05:27	<DON^SRK>	pls help me also
05:27	<Bassoon>	I'm also have problems getting Ubuntu to sense my headphone jack as filled.
05:28	<Bassoon>	I can put the headphones in, but sound will still come out of the speakers AND the headphones.
05:28	<kevykev>	Hi all, how do I get my sound to work?
05:28	<chicobo329>	oh wait! I had a couple of those  before. I forgot how long ago it was. It wasn't recent
05:28	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I suppose it depends on the exact definition of 'service', these scripts get run to start different things at init time.
05:28	<Drezard>	in regards to wireless connections...
05:28	<Nikonlappy>	you can use root .. there isnt a big problem with it.. but its frowned upon with this OS
05:28	<seamus7>	nano_ yes but it works in Ubuntu/gnome
05:28	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  the update manager  never ask you to do a partial-upgrade?
05:28	<bazhang>	roocraig: can you startup in recovery mode?
05:28	<nano_>	seamus7: sweet,tnx
05:28	<Geoffrey2>	why does it seem Ubuntu is no longer capable of automatically detecting wireless networks?
05:28	<roocraig>	how do you do that?
05:28	<chicobo329>	not recently, cvd-pr
05:28	<shally87>	Nikonlappy: thanks
05:28	<baudthief>	my install will likely break after a reboot, and I'm gonna need to start over - I've just backed up ~/home, are there any other dirs I need to back up that might contain personal files/info
05:28	<Nikonlappy>	shally87: np
05:28	<baudthief>	* ? even
05:28	<pawan>	how to install grahics driver nvidia
05:28	<chicobo329>	it has done partial-upgrades in the past
05:28	<roocraig>	bazhang: do you think it is that graphics setting?
05:28	<Bassoon>	Geoffrey2, for me it seems to update slower.
05:28	<bazhang>	roocraig: get into the boot menu and choose it there
05:28	<jamiejackson>	neil_d: if i add a script in there and make it executable, will just doing those two steps make it run at init time?
05:28	<chicobo329>	I can remember at least two. but not at any recent time around the release date
05:28	<shally87>	bazhang: ok..thanks a lot.. and so how do i learn how to use the server version?
05:28	<Shadow420>	how can I fix my login screen it's too big for my monitor
05:28	<Nikonlappy>	!nvidia | pawan
05:28	<ubotu>	pawan: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
05:28	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: Is there a rc.local there
05:29	<jamiejackson>	neil_d: yes
05:29	<Bassoon>	It still detects them, Geoffrey2.
05:29	<Bassoon>	I'm also have problems getting Ubuntu to sense my headphone jack as filled.
05:29	<Bassoon>	I can put the headphones in, but sound will still come out of the speakers AND the headphones.
05:29	<backdraft>	Anyone know what the fs type would be to mount a freebsd in ubuntu?
05:29	<Nikonlappy>	Bassoon: search the forums.. my bf had that same problem dunno if he got it fixed
05:29	<tech0007>	backdraft: ufs?
05:29	<Bassoon>	Will do.
05:29	<Geoffrey2>	Bassoon: hmmm, I'm having zero luck here..
05:29	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  that strange, cuz i used heron since beta but know say release version
05:29	<IcemanV9>	backdraft: ufs ... dunno if it is supported in ubuntu
05:29	<keycool1>	bazhang: did you see my paste?
05:30	<Nikonlappy>	Geoffrey2: try the forums if you have no luck
05:30	<bazhang>	shally87: best to get a desktop and then install LAMP on top--especially as you are new to this; alternately you could install ubuntu-desktop to that (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) and work from there --if you do not wish to reinstall
05:30	<Shadow420>	how can I fix my login screen it's too big for my monitor?
05:30	<backdraft>	Tried that one unknown fs
05:30	<chicobo329>	well I guess I could technically be on a release, but I had no major updates leading up to the release day
05:30	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I would sugjest you put your command in that rc.local file, maybe just something that wont cause trouble to start with.  like load a module you don't need as a test.
05:30	<roocraig>	bazhang: i am going to try that and I will reenter the chat and tell you if there was any luck-ok?
05:30	<IcemanV9>	backdraft: ufs2
05:30	<pawan>	cant load compiz in hardy
05:30	<chicobo329>	in fact, I didn't get any for about a day or so
05:30	<bazhang>	keycool1: the one in the channel? yes, sadly
05:30	<keycool1>	sadly?
05:30	<bazhang>	roocraig: I will be waiting ;]
05:30	<B166erx>	quickly,  is that a problem ( i dont have sound) ghost@Daedalus:~$ sudo modprobe snd-
05:30	<B166erx>	FATAL: Module snd_ not found.
05:31	<xim>	baudthief: your home dir contains everything except logs and programs
05:31	<keycool1>	oh right, wont past it in the channel anymore
05:31	<xim>	my ? is if I backup my home dir and then reinstall linux and copy the home folder back in, will I need to manually reinstall all the packages, or is there a list of installed packages saved somewhere in the home dir that can be restored all at once?
05:31	<bazhang>	keycool1: could you paste it to pastebin and then give me the link (please dont paste in the channel again thanks)
05:31	<Nikonlappy>	B166erx: nothing quick here
05:31	<seamus7>	maybe you just need to update grub ... first back up your menu.lst ... then sudo update-grub
05:31	<roxygirl>	does anyone know anything about watching full episodes (ie. from abc.com) from canada....is it an isp problem or a linux incompatibility?
05:31	<jamiejackson>	okay, neil_d, i can try that. thanks
05:31	<Flannel>	!cloning | xim
05:31	<ubotu>	xim: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type Â« dpkg --get-selections >	~/my-packages Â», move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type Â« sudo dpkg --set-selections < my-packages && apt-get dselect-upgrade Â» - See also !automate

05:31	<gotenks>	pawan: google how-to's for ubuntu.
05:31	<chicobo329>	I recall someone before saying they had a similar problem to mine in that the system was said to up to date when it really wasn't
05:32	<bazhang>	roxygirl: what is the link let me check
05:32	<Nikonlappy>	roxygirl: i watch from cbs.com all the time
05:32	<jmbiggs>	total noob here, question - I had HH RC installed but now can't seem to 'upgrade' to the full version, what do I need to do?
05:32	<dsas>	xim: You can use synaptic to create a list of packages which can then be installed once you have reinstalled
05:32	<B166erx>	Nikonlappy, make it long then :) i'm at it for 6 hours now..still no answers .
05:32	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: bye
05:32	<xim>	thx flannel
05:32	<shally87>	bazhang: LAMP? this too short for me..anyway i try to run it on my old laptop which uses celeron chipset.. so which one i should choose..1. standard personal computer or 2. 64bit amd and intel computers..
05:32	<seamus7>	chicobo329 maybe you just need to update grub ... backup menu.lst first ... then sudo update-grub
05:32	<Makgyver>	ok I am burning the ISO in MAC OS X under Toast, lest see if this works for the PowerPC
05:32	<Shpoo1>	I'm in the process of upgrading right now, and it's installing all the new packages. Quite of bunch of them couldn't be installed, whether due to missing dependencies, corrupt packages, or other reasons. Most were open office packages, but I can't remember all of them.

05:39	<Millertime_018>	iFire: you shouldn't actually use the upgrade option, because its so faulty, nothing wrong with a fresh install every time

06:15	<howlingmadhowie>	mepatuhoo: i'd be surprised if you could combine struts and php :)
06:15	<bazhang>	roocraig: why would *I* file a bug when I dont have one ;]
06:15	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	nope
06:15	<austin_>	Weird thing is I can connect via putty, just not scp
06:15	<dmsuperman>	damn
06:15	<JohnMMkubuntu>	in desktop behavior, I have show icons checked (always has been) along with the showing of the mounted volumes, yet no matter how many times I restart X the icons never appear on the desktop ...what more do I need to do?
06:15	<dpt>	no idea how to upload the whole directory usinf only ftp client on console?
06:15	<lnewbie_>	roocraig: this command:   sudo alsamixer

06:15	<bazhang>	ants: more info please
06:15	<IcemanV9>	austin_: putty is ssh and scp is "secure copy via ssh" stuff
06:15	<roocraig>	bazhang:i thought there may have been a bug report for ati graphics as well
06:16	<osmosis_>	anyone use libvirt or virsh ?

06:16	<green>	Should I download this http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download for StandardComputers if I want to install of PPC?
06:16	<roocraig>	Inewbie: what info do you want from the command?
06:16	<dpt>	Any solution to that? like a java console client for example?
06:16	<bazhang>	JohnMMkubuntu: this is kubuntu? kde3 or 4
06:16	<austin_>	hmm well i will try i guess, im new at this, thanks for the help
06:16	<dmsuperman>	amenado, you mean from df -h ?
06:16	<dpt>	I only have access to the console via SSH

=== austin_ is now known as austin17
06:17	<osmosis_>	how do I start a new kvm host with virsh ?
06:17	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	it depends i guess on what the php does,

06:17	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	paste both, df -h and mount

06:17	<lnewbie_>	what sound card it listed?

06:17	<khaotik>	is there a specific room i can talk about hardy in?
06:17	<mepatuhoo>	ï»¿amenado: well if i cant thats ok it was just an interesting experiment i wanted to try i would be happy to just use struts.
06:17	<leo_rockw>	JohnMMkubuntu: you can tell it to open the previous session, tho
06:18	<bazhang>	khaotik: you are in it ;]
06:18	<leo_rockw>	JohnMMkubuntu: that should do it
06:18	<IcemanV9>	khaotik: you are in the correct room
06:18	<howlingmadhowie>	mepatuhoo: however, if you really want to combine php and java you will have a lot of work to de
06:18	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	yeah stick with struts
06:18	<khaotik>	sweet the other night it was ubuntu+1 or something
06:18	<rodolfo>	has anyone here tried SWFdec player or Gnash?

06:18	<dot>	should I update it or?
06:19	<amenado>	mepatuhoo you are comparing apples and oranges

06:19	<IcemanV9>	khaotik: yea. #ubuntu+1 will be up soon as they are working on the next version

06:20	<bazhang>	JohnMMkubuntu: which settings? just move them around delete etc via either right click or drag and drop
06:20	<khaotik>	well i upgraded the other night with beta and the sound on my puter was all jacked. sounded like static
06:20	<bazhang>	dot charge? not sure--have you tried
06:20	<orudie_>	i currently have ubuntu 7.10 server installed.. how can i update it to the new version? and if i do , will it keep all my settings and installed programs unchanged ?
06:20	<Vlet>	mepatuhoo: rails!
06:21	<nickrud>	orudie_   sudo do-release-upgrade, and yes
06:21	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	no wonder you get 21gig  anything below / is what your are disk dumping
06:21	<dot>	bazhang: how does it look like?
06:21	<khaotik>	after countless hours of trying to fix, nothing so i reinstalled 7.10
06:21	<dot>	it has teh image on itunes
06:21	<bazhang>	orudie_: sudo do-release-upgrade
06:21	<dot>	and slide for emergency
06:21	<dot>	it's what comes in my computer
06:21	<mepatuhoo>	ï»¿amenado: i cant find tomcat in the add/remove app. Vlet: my boss has not trained me in rails yet. that i will be learning in a few months.
06:21	<Cpudan80>	Hello all
06:21	<bazhang>	dot how does what look like? not sure what you mean there thanks
06:21	<Vlet>	orudie_: baaad idea. Servers are supposed to be STABLE. upgrading to a distro the day it was released is begging for instability
06:21	<Cpudan80>	So I just a LAMP with HH --- it works ok except it wants me to download PHP files
06:21	<gooody>	what is the difference between KDE and GNOME deskto environments?
06:21	<Cpudan80>	vs just viewing them in firefox
06:22	<ants>	I have just upgraded and now the windows are not being decorated by emerald, although the top and bottom bars are
06:22]  * nickrud thinks Vlet has good advice, but someone's gotta test it :)
06:22	<bazhang>	www.distrowatch.com has the screenshots gooody
06:22	<howlingmadhowie>	mepatuhoo: struts is a web-framework. php is a language
06:22	<khaotik>	i was wondering if i download the live cd of 8.04 will all the things i did to get my laptop working properly be the same???
06:22	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	you have still good locks of hair? take a picture now, and then in six months take another for comparison <wink>
06:22	<tomoyuki28jp>	I have only one user to login, but I have to type user name every time.  Is there any way to set default login user??
06:22	<dmsuperman>	amenado, so wouldn't it then dump like 200+ GB? because my other hard drives have that much
06:22	<dot>	bazhang: it shows first an apple
06:22	<Vlet>	nickrud: yeah, I suppose ;)
06:22	<dot>	logo of apple
06:22	<Scunizi>	tomoyuki28jp: that's what keeps your machine safe..
06:22	<bazhang>	khaotik: hard to say no idea what you have done
06:22	<Vlet>	nickrud: we'll let him handle it :p
06:23	<gooody>	bazhang: are applications in gnome works in KDE too?
06:23	<bazhang>	dot not sure as dont have an iphone
06:23	<nickrud>	mepatuhoo  look for it in system->admin->synaptic
06:23	<dot>	bazhang: hen it comes a cable and itunes picture on iphone
06:23	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	the point is, you are trying to disk dump  /   and subfolders below
06:23	<dot>	and a slide for emergency calls
06:23	<bazhang>	gooody: many do yes
06:23	<f00f->	i just upgraded to 8.04, and now i get a white background when i login to X (no menu, desktop) and when i switch to VT1 i dont get a console. ideas?
06:23	<dot>	my computer shows "import photos"
06:23	<dot>	when I turn my iphone on
06:23	<mepatuhoo>	ï»¿amenado: why is there stuff in synaptic that are not in the add/remove app
06:23	<khaotik>	my broadcom chip.
06:23	<koomber1664>	is there something like a list of applications that I should try out on ubuntu?
06:23	<tomoyuki28jp>	Scunizi: So there is no way to skip the process??
06:23	<pbx>	If I boot the 8.04 CD on my crappy old dell and the video is wonky (repeating in three vertical stripes), is there anything in the installer that will help me correct tat?
06:23	<Fireal>	hey all, has anyone found a way to get the ati (fglrx) driver to stick, I can't seem, to get rid of mesa
06:23	<bazhang>	dot this is gutsy or hardy
06:23	<orudie_>	Vlet, so are you saying i shouldn't update ?
06:23	<dot>	bazhang: gutsy
06:23	<gooody>	bazhang: Kubuntu uses KDE environment, am i right?
06:23	<dot>	i run gutsy
06:24	<lnewbie_>	roocraig: so it detected sound chip; make sure PCM is not muted
06:24	<milly1234>	well I found out how to solve my wireless problems with my linksys wireless pci card.... to not use the linux rt2500 drivers and use the windows wireless driver thing instead
06:24	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	i dont know, i have not really looked deeply on what add/remove have compared to synaptic
06:24	<dmsuperman>	amenado, Right, which I figured would either take all the mounted drives with it or it wouldn't. It's obviously not, because then the dump would be well over 200 GB. However, / is only using 4.5GB, so I'm just wondering where the extra 15GB of data comes from
06:24	<bazhang>	khaotik: you may want to hang on to gutsy a bit longer then ;]
06:24	<Scunizi>	tomoyuki28jp: yes.. but if you do you're opening your machine to the outside world.. I don't know the specifics of how to just that it can be done
06:24	<bazhang>	gooody: aye
06:24	<nickrud>	tomoyuki28jp install gdmsetup, and on the security tab you can set the auto logged in user
06:24	<khaotik>	i finally found a thread that works seamless on the wireless chip i have. is it safe to say that i could use the same thread?
06:24	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	look /dev/sdb5              20G  4.5G   14G  25% /   that tells me you are trying to dump at least 20Gigs
06:24	<roocraig>	Inewbie: pcm not muted---where should I go from here?
06:24	<f00f->	i hate this fucking ubuntu shit, low quality releases, almost every single time :(
06:24	<Vlet>	orudie_: well, you can try, but if your server is a live system (actively serving a purpose) then you should wait, and perhaps install HH server on a test system

06:25	<Claan22>	I was wondering if anybody would be willing to help me get my Realtek 8185 wireless card working.  I've found a few different ways to set it up that supposedly work (mostly with ndiswrapper), but I keep messing up or something, because it never works
06:25	<tomoyuki28jp>	nickrud:  I will try that.  Thanks !
06:25	<bazhang>	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone dot you should read this first
06:25	<dmsuperman>	amenado, the 4.5 is the used space, 20g is the size of the partition. Does it write 0's for all the rest of the partition?
06:25	<khaotik>	maybe you should read more foof
06:25	<Vlet>	f00f-: here's a great alternative: http://microsoft.com/ :-P
06:25	<mepatuhoo>	ï»¿amenado: there is a lot of stuff that showed up for tomcat what do i check
06:25	<tobe002>	hi guys
06:25	<dot>	but it does only say I need it jailbroken
06:25	<f00f->	i'm looking at the release notes, and don't see any specific caveats.
06:25	<bazhang>	khaotik: really hard to say; some have had success others not
06:25	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	please read the man pages of dd,  man dd  so you get an idea what is being dumped
06:25	<gooody>	bazhang: thanks for the information. i just want to learn more about linux environment.
06:25	<JPSman>	how do I install flash into firefox?
06:26	<koomber1664>	The only trouble I've had with my install was (a) Intel shipping dire sata drivers, and (b) my gfx nearly giving me a fit with the flickering till I updated the drivers.  All in all a very pleasant expereince
06:26	<fxfitz>	For some reason, my wireless keypad buttons aren't working. Does anyone have any ideas how to fix this?
06:26	<dot>	it means I need to jailbreak it to get it charging?
06:26	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	all of it? i dont know what is on the list
06:26	<lnewbie_>	Vlet: haha
06:26	<milly1234>	8.04 has been the most problamatic release I've installed in a long while.... especially when it came to wireless internet and video
06:26	<bazhang>	dot no idea about charging; seems unlikely though  best not to risk it imo
06:26	<mepatuhoo>	ï»¿amenado: there is quite a bit
06:26	<Fireal>	why did xorg take a step back?  Anyone know a link to a working how-to for ati cards?
06:26	<nickrud>	f00f- I've read of people having that issue with fglrx, from ati's site
06:26	<dmsuperman>	amenado, Will do
06:26	<amenado>	milly1234->	i will second you.. networking seems problematic in Hardy
06:27	<Claan22>	does anybody know how to get ndiswrapper working?
06:27	<insmod>	<Claan22>i have that in my laptop and it works great
06:27	<dot>	kthanxbye
06:27	<khaotik>	what about my sound issue? i tried the upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04 and the sound was all staticky. do you think if i install from a live cd would make difference
06:27	<bazhang>	dot you're welcome
06:27	<mabus>	how come when I vnc to my ubuntu machine when it's first booted, it just shows a basic x desktop before closing after a minute or so. never brings up gdm. I can only login remotely if I first login using my keyboard locally on the machine. how can I remedy this?
06:27	<adil>	floodbot2: hey
06:27	<mepatuhoo>	ï»¿amenado: i am going to check all of it
06:27	<cool>	!sound | khaotik
06:27	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	you can download tomcat from tomcat.apache.org
06:27	<ubotu>	khaotik: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
06:27	<amenado>	mepatuhoo->	go for it
06:27	<f00f->	nickrud: thanks for the headsup, i will investigate!
06:27	<khaotik>	claan22  what kind of machine you trying to run it on???
06:28	<ants>	I have just upgraded and now the windows are not being decorated by emerald, although the top and bottom bars are. Does anyone know why it might bedoing this?
06:28	<pygmymath>	Just to say everyone. Trying to install xp sp2 on an old box and this channel is >>>	windows by a mile. I love you all.
06:28	<nickrud>	f00f- I think that reinstalling the restricted modules, libgl1-mesa-dri, libgl-mesa-glx and rebooting turned the trick
06:28	<Claan22>	khaotik: a laptop, AMD-64 processor
06:28	<tvn>	could someone tell me the irc server that has the #java channel ?
06:28	<f00f->	ok i'll try to reboot in textmode :)

06:28	<milly1234>	I just hope to see some updates coming out soon, i have not seen a single one since I upgraded to 8.04, but then again I guess I am being impatient
06:28	<whta>	how can I get the AWN applets installed? it seems everything else is in the repositories now but the applets.
06:28	<Claan22>	khaotik: alienware Aurora m9700

06:29	<mabus>	amenado: I realize that's the more secure option, but why can I not login otherwise until I've logged in locally?
06:30	<milly1234>	its been pretty messy for me, gutsy was near flawless on this machine, hardy was a day and a half of investigating and tweaking

06:32	<roocraig>	Inewbie: i get sound through my headphones but not the laptop speakers
06:32	<led3234>	ok then, how do i do that?
06:32	<mabus>	amenado: I realize that's the more secure option, but why can I not login otherwise until I've logged in locally?
06:32	<amenado>	orudie_->	not necessarily true always
06:32	<dmsuperman>	amenado, alright, read it. My only idea so far is to use the nofollow flag when executing so it won't follow symlinks, but other than that I'm still drawing a blank as to where it gets the extra data. it's not copying the mounted drives, because it would be much bigger, but it's also not just copying the files from the partition, because it would be smaller
06:32	<redips>	I have a nvidia tv-15..Crashes every so often.

06:33	<keen__>	how do i mount an iso file?
06:33	<shtoom>	oddalot: then the best way is to upgrade from CD downloading it thru bittorrent
06:33	<mabus>	arrouan: how come when I vnc to my ubuntu machine when it's first booted, it just shows a basic x desktop before closing after a minute or so. never brings up gdm. I can only login remotely if I first login using my keyboard locally on the machine. how can I remedy this?
06:33	<nickrud>	green ppc , I have you a link earlier
06:33	<Shadow420>	bazhang that link worked I figured out it was my old xorg file was nogood

06:33	<Baby_Shambl3s>	hi how stable is transmission as a peer-to-peer client? Would it be better for me to use deluge isntead?
06:33	<mabus>	amenado: ^^^ that was my original question
06:33	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	dd means dumping the whole disk if /dev/sdb5 is /  and per your pasted, its 20gig

06:34	<green>	nickrud Sorry this irc doesn;t alert me when I get a message, do you mind postng it again? sorry
06:34	<mabus>	you said to ssh in with x forwarding. why do I have to do this, isn't there a way I can continue to connect to Xvnc normally and get a gdm prompt, without first logging in locally?
06:34	<keen__>	Starnestommy thanks
06:34	<banana21>	scroll up
06:34	<nickrud>	green get a different irc client, you are bright red when you use my nick in xchat :)

06:35	<khaotik>	clann22  i dont know if this would be of any help but check out thread 575750. it might give you some ideas

06:35	<Claan22>	thanks khaotik
06:35	<dmsuperman>	amenado, So even if the rest of the disk is empty it will dump 0's then?
06:35	<amenado>	mabus no, thats your vncserver prompt, not the gdm prompt
06:35	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	yes
06:35	<nickrud>	Fdisk_ right click an mp3, select properties, then the open with tab (for gnome)
06:35	<redips>	.iso files. Just double click on it in ubuntu and put a blank cd in your burner.
06:35	<oddalot>	lol
06:35	<mabus>	amenado: it asks for my Xvnc password, then brings me to the login prompt. but that's if I've logged in locally already. otherwise, I just enter the vnc password and it goes to a x server with nothing on it, before disappearing after a minute
06:35	<banana21>	in ubuntu, the vncserver connects you to the current session only
06:35	<lnewbie_>	Fireal: Man... Im batting 0...I have no Idea
06:35	<mabus>	amenado: nope I'm positive on that one. gdm login screen.
06:36	<banana21>	as far as I know
06:36	<mabus>	HIV positive
06:36	<green>	OK nickrud I will try to load that, but will a i386 live cd word on a g4 ppc?

06:36	<Fdisk_>	k ive done that but sometimes is still opens witm movie player
06:36	<dmsuperman>	amenado, Alright, that's what I needed to know. Do you have a suggestion for either A: Not writing the 0's or B: An alternate method to backup my whole Ubuntu install?
06:36	<nickrud>	green no
06:36	<Baby_Shambl3s>	hi how stable is transmission as a peer-to-peer client? Would it be better for me to use deluge isntead?
06:36	<amenado>	mabus, okay, i have to retry it on my host..
06:36	<khaotik>	instead of downloading the driver he has for broadcom find out which .inf driver you need. i would guess the same steps would work.
06:36	<oddalot>	i haven't been able to compile any program myself for ubuntu
06:36	<green>	nickrud I can't seem to find a torrent either
06:36	<oddalot>	from the source code
06:36	<Fireal>	nickrud: I already have version 7.0.3 installed
06:36	<Starnestommy>	oddalot: what error messages do you get?
06:36	<milly1234>	with compiz-fusion for some reason when the password dialog comes up for when I need root privalages when the background darkens it stays that way until Io move a window or activate the cube causing it to have to redraw something
06:36	<amenado>	dmsuperman->	use tar or rsync and options for exclude
06:36	<nickrud>	green yeah, it's a pain for the minor releases
06:36	<Baby_Shambl3s>	oddalot: you're hard linux is not hard it only responds to your command and that is if you know what youre doing so how can linux be hard?
06:36	<amenado>	am off for a while
06:36	<nickrud>	Fireal ?
06:37	<dmsuperman>	amenado, alright thanks :D

06:37	<nickrud>	Fireal hardy comes with 8.3 ati driver (some other number is equiv, don't remember off hand)
06:37	<nickrud>	Fireal reinstall them, the ati install messes them up.
06:37	<adil>	hi
06:37	<oddalot>	Stanestommy: when i try and compile xmms i get errors saying it's missing header files and that the c code has errors
06:38	<dmsuperman>	amenado, One last question I think. If I use the tar option (which I'm pretty sure I'm gonna go with, for simplicity sake) will it follow symlinks? Or will it just copy the linkfile itself?
06:38	<Fireal>	nickrud: right I install it and when i type fglrx-info it still says I am using mesa (after restart of course)
06:38	<ChrisULM>	hey guys, our local lug is putting on an ubuntu booth at a show tom. are there any videos of the OS that we can have playing on a few of the machines?
06:38	<ChrisULM>	like ones showing off compiz, etc
06:38	<nickrud>	Fireal look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log , you'll probably find a starred section that says you have a kernel mismatch
06:39	<pygmymath>	ChrisULM: go into firefox, hit the location bar and type Ubuntu Compiz and there you are :P

06:55	<WGGMk>	leo_rockw: you underestimate the power of the n00b
06:55	<sam__>	its really obnoxious
06:55	<leo_rockw>	WGGMk: but i've been using gnu/linux for a longer time than that...
06:56	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Koheleth: xfce is just meant to be lighter than nautilus, whats good about it depends on the user and how much resources they can use
06:56	<Koheleth>	I see
06:56	<androver>	sam, just a guess, CPU scaling probably isn't working in ubuntu
06:56	<Koheleth>	Baby_Shambl3s, arnt you meant to be in jail?
06:56	<sam__>	so does that mean my CPU is doing too much work?
06:57	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Koheleth: o_o dont spread it around
06:57	<androver>	kind of, yeah.  lemme find you a reference that tells you how to fix it.
06:57	<dmsuperman>	Alright, I'm now backing up my full partition, excluding any extra data (such as /proc, /media, etc.) where are all the main places ubuntu uses for extra data that I can delete? For example, before backing up windows I would flush the temporary internet files, and the prefetch, to save room
06:57	<androver>	sam__: try this: http://www.arsgeek.com/?p=3344
06:57	<Claan22>	how do I use the 'make' command?  the instructions I'm following say "It can be done by make, so only type in make into the console, when you are in the driver main directory. "  I have the directory open in the file browser, then I switch to the terminal and type 'make', and it says that there's no target
06:58	<androver>	Claan22: you have to cd to that directory in the console first
06:58	<Koheleth>	prolly got net access in nick
06:58	<Claan22>	androver: ah.  how do I do that?
06:58	<McGod>	How do I create a startup script
06:58	<unop>	Claan22, you probably need to run ./configure first -- but do read the INSTALL/README file first, it varies from package to package
06:58	<McGod>	I need to startup my network
06:58	<androver>	just type "cd <directory here>"...
06:58	<albech>	does ubuntu support diskless install? booting from a nfs mount?
06:58	<unop>	albech, sure
06:58	<androver>	if you want to get to /usr/local/bin/foo, you type "cd /usr/local/bin/foo"
06:59	<unop>	without the quotes :)
06:59	<OldSocks>	I have a problem. I installed 8.04, and the only thing that makes me ticked off is I can't access my D:\ drive. I installed using Wubi, and I installed ubuntu onto my D drive. However when I boot up ubuntu, I can only access my C drive. Anyone know a fix?
07:00	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: it dont work like that you have to go into the directory using cli (command line) so it would be cd /"than directory path >	once inside the director make wait for it to make and than sudo make install (make sure you have buil-essential installed)
07:00	<Claan22>	YES it seems to be working, thanks guys
07:00	<gooody>	is there any way to edit icon settings in ubuntu gutsy?
07:00	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: you should be able to get at the D drive ehhh look in
07:00	<androver>	no prob
07:00	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Err well is drive D a second partition on the first physical disk - or is it its own physical disk
07:00	<cool>	gooody, System>Preferences>Appearance
07:00	<seamus7>	gooody you can install different icon sets in Appearances ... you change individual icons by right-clicking an app and choosing properties
07:01	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: it is a second partition on my main disk. I was able to access D with 7, but with Hardy, I don't see it.
07:01	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: like unop said you might have to run ./configure first than make, you can also try make check just incase to see if you have all dependencies
07:01	<sam__>	weird, i cant open CPU frequency scaling monitor in my taskbar
07:01	<sam__>	how can i find it
07:01	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Is it NTFS or FAT32 ?
07:01	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: NTFS logical
07:01	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: brb - something is wrong with my client - gotta reboot it
07:01	<unop>	Claan22, it's always recommended you read the INSTALL/README files before making assumptions and running ./configure or make
07:01	<led3234>	how do i install the propietery (sp?) drivers?
07:01	<cool>	sam__, you installed it?
07:01	<Claan22>	how do I use ./configure?  make is giving me 'error 2', so I figure that's the problem
07:01	<androver>	sam__: it doesn't show up when you right-click on the taskbar and say "add to panel"?
07:01	<Pinky>	whew, I finally got ubuntu 8.04 installed :)
07:02	<Cpudan80>	Ok well that was odd
07:02	<Claan22>	unop:  I'm following instructions on the internet, they just tell me to make it
07:02	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently
07:02	<sam__>	add new item?
07:02	<Cpudan80>	all my responses decided to be white
07:02	<Cpudan80>	anyway
07:02	<androver>	it's called "add to panel" on mine, I'm on hardy.
07:02	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: So NTFS partition... ok.. so you should be able to hit it at /media/sdb I think
07:02	<seamus7>	Any strong reason to do a fresh install rather than an upgrade?
07:02	<OldSocks>	Baby_Shambl3s: yea I know that, but I can't access my D drive, even though its called something else.
07:02	<unop>	Claan22, trust the instructions in the INSTALL file over anything else - they are probably more authoritative than anything else
07:02	<cool>	sam__, This would help -->	http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-change-cpu-frequency-scaling-in-ubuntu.html
07:03	<gooody>	seamus7: i want to change the way my icon display in the desktop. i don't like the way pdf, images and other files displayed as thumbnails like on my desktop.
07:03	<Daniel15>	Hi everyone... I just upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04 and keep getting "You are not allowed to access the system configuration" when I try to go to items in System ->	Administration (eg. Networking)
07:03	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: Hmm, I'll give it a try. Got to reboot into ubuntu.
07:03	<Daniel15>	Any ideas how to fix that?
07:03	<OldSocks>	Thanks.
07:03	<oddalot>	ahhh...here is the problem  "checking whether build environment is sane... yes  "   <--lol, this should say no
07:03	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: first thing you need to do is go into the folder and check Readme file and Install file if it is provided or go to the site and check documentations to see which commands you need, have you even got a compiler?
07:03	<cool>	gooody, you can find more eye candy on gnome-look.org
07:03	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: It might not be automatically mounted, if that's the case - come back and we can walk through it
07:03	<seamus7>	gooody how would you like your icons to appear?
07:03	<Koheleth>	xfce programs hide behind the tool bar, anyway to make it rest at the top of the tool bar like in a mac
07:03	<OldSocks>	cpudan80: alright thanks. I'll reboot now.
07:04	<gooody>	seamus7: just like pdf licons like in windows
07:04	<sam__>	when i right click on my panel i dont get those options
07:04	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: in windows you wont be able to access d:\ as it is in linux partition m$ windows wont read it but ubuntu will read windows and other partitions
07:04	<sam__>	is it because im using Xubuntu?
07:04	<androver>	sam: yup, that's it.
07:04	<Claan22>	baby_shambl3s: there's a readme, but it doesn't explain installation at all.  there's no install file.  I don't know if I have a compiler.  I'm following instructions here: http://rtl-wifi.sourceforge.net/wiki/Installing which I guess it the website
07:04	<gooody>	seamus7: the default setting consumes a lot of space on my desktop
07:04	<oddalot>	w00t, i think it's compiling....IT"S ALIVE
07:04	<androver>	you'll have to do CPU scaling some other way.
07:05	<seamus7>	gooody you don't want the icons to preview their content ... you just want the pdf symbol to appear as the icon?
07:05	<Daniel15>	gooody, you just want normal icons to appear, and not the preview? Go to a folder and click Edit ->Preferences, change the "Show thumbnails" item on the Preview tab.
07:05	<gooody>	seamus7: yes
07:05	<koomber1664>	um, how do I get my waste bin back on a panel?
07:05	<sam__>	damn xfce
07:05	<seamus7>	gooody read what Daniel15 wrote
07:06	<oddalot>	koomber right click, add to panel
07:06	<oddalot>	i had to restart once
07:06	<oddalot>	maybe it's a bug
07:06	<Daniel15>	Can anyone help with my problem? I just upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04 and keep getting "You are not allowed to access the system configuration" when I try to go to items in System ->	Administration (eg. Networking)
07:06	<seamus7>	Daniel15 did you Unlock the window?
=== co_macho is now known as fatur
07:06	<androver>	sam: what kind of CPU do you have?
07:06	<DON^SRK>	Hi Alls...Pls tell me how can i use paltalk on ubuntu ?
07:07	<gooody>	thanks guys. it works.
07:07	<Daniel15>	seamus7, what do you mean? I just click that option in the menu and that error pops up. The network config doesn't even load.
07:07	<sam__>	Intel Celeron (its probably 4 years old or so)
07:07	<seamus7>	Daniel15 are you set up as the administrator ... your username that is?
07:07	<sam__>	HP Computer (if thats what u wanted to know)
07:08	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: its quite straight forward i think first two commands as I believe you did get the latest stable drive for you oyu cna even use command locate i.e. locate /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211
07:08	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211
07:08	<Daniel15>	Yeah, it worked fine in Ubuntu 7.10, but hasn't worked since I updated to 8.04
07:08	<androver>	ok, 2 suggestions.  first, apt-get install cpudyn.  if that doesn't help, apt-get install cpufreqd and google "cpufreqd" to configure it.
07:08	<seamus7>	Daniel15 look in UsersandGroups and see what privileges your username has?
07:09	<oddalot>	awww man still didn't work
07:09	<MrRoboto>	how can I save my external drive, it is not being recognized by ubuntu!!!! ??
07:09	<Daniel15>	seamus7, I can't access that, same error :S
07:09	<seamus7>	Daniel15 do you have another username you can login as?
07:09	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: its quite straight forward i think first two commands as I believe you did get the latest stable drive for you if you follow that it should work easily
07:09	<Daniel15>	seamus7, I'll try to run it from a terminal and see if there's any output
07:09	<Daniel15>	Nope, no other users
07:09	<cool>	MrRoboto, after plugging it in, check dmesg for last 10 lines

07:22	<jaffarkelshac>	oh i see, its has gotten easier and am a little frustrated not being able to grasp and control the network interface as easily leo_rockw
07:22	<DaBonBon>	talcite: how did you "abort" it?
07:22	<prettyricky>	Does compiz work for 8.04? if so where do I get it?
07:22	<dmsuperman>	I run the following code to tar my whole ubuntu partition: "sudo tar cvpjf /media/sdb2/backups/full-system.backup.tar.bz2 --exclude=/proc --exclude=/lost+found --exclude=/mnt --exclude=/sys --exclude=/media /" And it goes through and seemingly copies every file, but the only problem is the resulting bz2 file is 0 bytes. Any ideas why?
07:22	<leo_rockw>	jaffarkelshac: are you on kde or gnome?
07:22	<Tyczek>	hi, should I turn off ESD if I am using pulseaudio?

07:22	<OberonKing>	HI, somebody knows how turn pata device again to pata... and not sata device.... since this excelent idea I can't burn cd/dvd

07:27	<WGGMk>	oddalot: you beat me to the punch
07:28	<cool>	GirlRiver, try nvidia-settings
07:28	<oddalot>	pwnt
07:28	<cool>	!sound | Birkemark
07:28	<OberonKing>	DaBonBon, maybe some problems with dma I think...... start in Feisty when turn ide device to sata device... wait, I paste  a log
07:28	<ubotu>	Birkemark: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File ->	Change Device (ALSA Mixer).

07:28	<arvind_khadri>	zeno,  and to clean the cache its sudo apt-get autoclean

07:28	<dmsuperman>	zeno, still doesn't work

07:28	<prettyricky>	it does not come with 8.04
07:28	<WGGMk>	GirlRiver: make sure its "sudo nvidia-settings"
07:28	<sam__>	hellz yea oddalot
07:29	<oddalot>	you have to sudo apt-get install nvidia-settings

07:29	<WGGMk>	prettyricky: what does not come with hardy???
07:29	<sam__>	ok
07:29	<Birkemark>	thanks... i will look at it
07:29	<prettyricky>	compiz manager?
07:29	<zeno>	dmsuperman: u sure 1. you have the right packages turned on, 2. your internets good?
07:30	<zeno>	dmsuperman: you could also try with -f (fix missing)
07:30	<guitarj1d>	ï»¿after upgrading to hardy my ati driver isn't working properly, i get the following error when trying to change the resolution, "The X Server does not support the XRandR extension.", can anyone help
07:30	<dmsuperman>	zeno, I'm talkin here aren't I? ;) and yeah, I haven't modified a single thing in my settings as far as aptitutd
07:30	<WGGMk>	prettyricky: System >	Accessories >	Apperance -->	Visual Effects tab will let you adjust the settings.. but if you want full control you need to install compizconfig-settings-manager... the reason this package is not installed by default is because if your not carefull you can seriously hinder your system

08:09	<Vertelemming>	Peddy: Then your best bet is to check /var/log/Xorg.0.log and see if there are any useful error messages.
08:09	<Shadow_X>	sudo mount -t smbfs -o username=cedwards,password=******* //192.168.1.30 /media/ShadowServ
08:09	<arvind_khadri>	guitarj1d, hmm yeah
08:09	<kade2>	if i download and burn to cd, will there be an option to upgrade (since it's not working through update manager) ? will this strip my files?
08:09	<whirlybird20>	I don't know that I can help. Sorry maybe someone else can come up with a solution
08:09	<JKirk_>	shadow: thanks...but it was so easy with the menu item...where'd it go?
08:10	<androver>	Shadow_X, and the message it returned?
08:10	<dcraig>	hi, is there a straightforward way to "downgrade" from the desktop version to the server version of ubuntu?
08:10	<ocean>	charly
08:10	<Peddy>	cool: ok, hold on
08:10	<ocean>	salu
08:10	<Shadow_X>	This command is designed to be run from within /bin/mount by giving
08:10	<Shadow_X>	the option '-t smbfs'. For example:  mount -t smbfs -o username=tridge,password=foobar //fjall/test /data/test
08:10	<Ardin>	Shadow_X: did you install the samba client stuff?
08:10	<Shadow_X>	yes
08:10	<Peddy>	Vertelemming: the only useful info I can find is this: http://pastebin.ca/998167
08:10	<Shadow_X>	it was already installed in ubuntu
08:11	<arvind_khadri>	guitarj1d, pertaining to your kernel
08:11	<kade2>	question - if i download and burn to cd, will there be an option to upgrade (since it's not working through update manager) ? will this strip my files?
08:11	<meoblast001>	hi
08:11	<gooody>	can i run KDE environment on my ubuntu gutsy?
08:11	<prettyricky>	Does frostwire work on 8.04 cause I can get it to work on mine...
08:11]  * Ardin wanders away
08:11	<JustinRyan>	dcraig: Someone better versed than I will probably say I'm wrong, but you should be able to just uninstall the GUI
08:11	<Swanonymous>	my microphone is incredibly quiet in skype on ubuntu, any help?!
08:11	<ferris>	ok, so after upgrading to hardy, my wifi doesn't work. This is on a laptop Compaq Presario C500 with the Broadcom wifi. It uses the R151517.EXE drivers. I have used the instructions on the ubuntu forums under 7.1* found at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=297092&highlight=ubuntu+wireless+presario+c500 which worked flawlessly, but for 8.04... nothing
08:11	<arvind_khadri>	gooody, yeah
08:11	<Peddy>	Vertelemming, cool: I'm going to restart X, bear with me
08:11	<prettyricky>	I cant get it to work
08:11	<stib>	!apt-get
08:11	<ubotu>	APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
08:11	<JKirk_>	that sudo mount doesn't work :(
08:12	<gooody>	arvind_khadri: does it affect my installed applications?
08:12	<androver>	Shadow_X: something is strange then.  stupid question: what does "which mount" return?
08:12	<meoblast001>	my distrubution upgrade has been stuck at Configuring Scrollkeeper for a while, im afraid of it getting stuck..... what should i do if it gets stuck?
08:12	<aprendiz>	hola a todos

08:12	<meoblast001>	it didnt
08:12	<JKirk_>	Can anyone help me with sharing my ubuntu home folder so my winxp box can get to it?
08:12	<arvind_khadri>	gooody, nope not at all
08:12	<dcraig>	thanks, JustinRyan! we'll see if anyone contradicts you... :)
08:12	<Shadow_X>	/bin/mount
08:12	<gooody>	arvind_khadri: how can i do that?
08:12	<prettyricky>	Does frostwire work on 8.04 cause I cant get it to work on my computer
08:13	<JustinRyan>	dcraig: Provided they don't, it would be "sudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop"
08:13	<arvind_khadri>	gooody, sudo apt-get install kde
08:13	<JKirk_>	also, I've got a IBM T40 laptop and I can't seem to use XORG 3D effects... anyone know where I could find a driver?
08:13	<MagoonD>	how can I mount .uif (universal image format) in ubuntu?
08:13	<JustinRyan>	dcraig: Unless you're running one of the variants, then it would be *ubuntu-desktop
08:13	<Peddy>	Vertelemming: any ideas?
08:13	<nick_>	Hello there, is it possilbe to make grub boot one of the OS automatically instead of the list coming up
08:13	<jonah>	I can't access my shared folders on my Vista pc thru Ubuntu. I can see the workgroup but nothing happens when i try to open it.. any ideas?
08:13	<Peddy>	cool: be right there
08:13	<arvind_khadri>	gooody, sudo apt-get install kde-desktop
08:13	<nick_>	Hello there, is it possilbe to make grub boot one of the OS automatically instead of the list coming up
08:13	<dcraig>	JustinRyan, just plain old ubuntu with a U :)
08:13	<Vertelemming>	Peddy: Strange. It should be working fine, given that log.
08:13	<gooody>	arvind_khadri: what are the big changes after i install it?
08:14	<aprendiz>	como puedo montar un disco  formateado ntfs
08:14	<arvind_khadri>	nick_, yeah
08:14	<cool>	nick_, yes it is, reduce the time period in grub.conf
08:14	<aprendiz>	en ubuntou
08:14	<cool>	nick_, and the default os will be booted
08:14	<prettyricky>	Does frostwire work on 8.04 cause I cant get it to work on my computer
08:14	<guitarj1d>	arvind_khadri: how do i find out my kernel again
08:14	<whirlybird20>	Why does xvidcap close when I click record?
08:14	<arvind_khadri>	gooody, no big changes ,you would need to install some other components of it
08:14	<androver>	Shadow_X: can you do a paste at http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/ with your shell output?  blank out the password, but paste in everything you typed and all the responses.
08:14	<Phyllis>	I'm looking for directions to get a windows computer to make a bootable xubuntu (text based) usb drive, can someone point me in the right direction ?

08:14	<whirlybird20>	Am i doing something wrong?
08:14	<MagoonD>	how can I mount .uif files (universal image format) in ubuntu?
08:15	<cool>	!frostwire | prettyricky
08:15	<ubotu>	prettyricky: frostwire is a totally open source version of Limewire.  For installation help, please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FrostWire
08:15	<Vertelemming>	Peddy: If you're using the restricted driver, try disabling it, doing "sudo apt-get clean", rebooting, reinstalling the driver, and then rebooting again.
08:15	<ferris>	ok, so after upgrading to hardy, my wifi doesn't work. This is on a laptop Compaq Presario C500 with the Broadcom wifi. It uses the R151517.EXE drivers.

08:15	<Phyllis>	!xubuntu
08:15	<Shadow_X>	androver, odd, now its denying me access to mounting
08:15	<gooody>	arvind_khadri: are applications in KDE different from that of GNOME?
08:15	<ubotu>	Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of !GNOME. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/ - To install from Ubuntu: Â« sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop Â» - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
08:15	<Peddy>	Vertelemming: I've tried that, but to no avail. Also, here's my xorg.conf: http://pastebin.ca/998172
08:15	<JustinRyan>	Phyllis: I don't know about text-based, but here is a tutorial for putting *ubuntu on a thumb drive: http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-on-usb-bar
08:15	<Shadow_X>	its trying to mount, just denying access >.>

08:21	<mary>	excuse me
08:21	<androver>	Shadow_X: it's a whole lot easier to share stuff over scp or something like that than over samba
08:21	<nick_>	arvind_khadri: son't understand, ive got the txt file loaded
08:21	<bluefox83>	Shadow_X, i know someone who lives in ohio that uses that exact nickname, he's an old friend of mine
08:21	<Shadow_X>	androver, because i have a windows workstation that i use for production purposes, and need access to my fileserve, which is running Debian

08:23	<Peddy>	Vertelemming: any ideas? its not to do with xorg.conf
08:23	<androver>	Shadow_X: you're gonna have to figure out why the smb connection isn't working...it'll probably be a combination of checking the smb logs on the server and output from smbclient on the client
08:23	<Shadow_X>	bluefox83, nah, but like i said, i'll prolly be going to school in Ohio next year so yea :P

08:46	<arvind_khadri>	guitarj1d, seems of no use
08:46	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: great... then you should be good to go with network manager.  does NM allow you to see networks?
08:46	<androver>	prettyricky: as a test, BACK UP YOUR EXISTING XORG.CONF FILE and replace it with that one.
08:46	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: and I would uninstall ndiswrapper....

08:48	<nick_>	anyone familiar with how using kplot
08:48	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: you can do it that way too... I just use the console quite a bit.. and it apears you are quite confortable doing the same...
08:48	<androver>	prettyricky: open up a console, and then do a "cd /etc/X11"
08:48	<MagoonD>	i have two hard drives and I can see both of them using gnome, but how do I browse the files for the other hd from the terminal?
08:48	<prettyricky>	androver=== how do I get to that you mentioned
08:48	<merlin_>	<yet another newb looking for help with nvidia drivers
08:48	<joe_>	Is there a specific channel I can jump in for video problems?  I can't get my nvidia drivers working for nothing
08:49	<androver>	prettyricky: then you backup xorg.conf by typing "mv xorg.conf xorg.conf.old"
08:49	<ompaul>	!nvidia
08:49	<ubotu>	For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
08:49	<Narshil>	Kr0ntab:i can use the console, i just dont know the commands lol
08:49	<joe_>	merlin I'm right there with you
08:49	<prettyricky>	I thought I could use the edit xorg
08:49	<ompaul>	prettyricky, there are tools to do it for you
08:49	<merlin_>	did u get to the part where it asks for the sourcecode?
08:49	<Taejo>	androver, http://pastebin.com/d5399fdf3
08:49	<pclync1>	can anyone help with login? i need to change the color between login and desktop...
08:49	<Narshil>	its still trying to connect. thats why i figured the driver wasnt good and tried ndiswrapper
08:49	<androver>	prettyricky: then you save http://tmp.ua964.com/xorg.conf from your web browser to /etc/X11, and hit ctrl+alt+backspace to restart X.
08:49	<phreakv6>	joe_ ... same prob but with ATI after hardy upgrade for me
08:49	<Taejo>	androver, this looks wrong: -rw------- 1 root lp 458752 2007-11-02 13:21 /var/cache/cups/ppds.dat
08:50	<joe_>	merlin_: yep
08:50	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: hehe thats just a matter of practice..  :-P  btw... is there a reason you tried ndiswrapper to begin with?  iwl is the default.. and typically works out the gate.  is it still not working?
08:50	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: ah ok
08:50	<merlin_>	yeah...ur right there with me then lol
08:50	<Narshil>	Kr0ntab:still not working
08:50	<GirlRiver>	I'm trying to get dual monitor working in heron, the laptop has 1280x800 and the external lcd has 1280x1024. nvidia-settings only gives me 640x480 on the second monitor. Can someone help ?
08:50	<androver>	taejo, yeah, that looks wrong!  make it group-read-writable
08:50	<joe_>	merlin_: what kind of video card?
08:50	<merlin_>	8600gt
08:50	<MagoonD>	how do I switch to my second mounted hard drive, in windows DOS i would do cd d: please help
08:50	<joe_>	8800gts here
08:50	<arvind_khadri>	GirlRiver, reconfigure X
08:51	<Narshil>	Kr0ntab:im going to disable wireless security and see if that helps
08:51	<merlin_>	problem is im wireless so the installer cant download what it needs
08:51	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: ok ok..  I see.  well iwl is actually a decent driver and works fairly well...  what security on the ap do you use.
08:51	<joe_>	God I never thought I would say this, I miss dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
08:51	<Kr0ntab>	?
08:51	<ferris_>	bluefox83, interesting... I think swift fox is firefox with the swifter-firefox-plugin
08:51	<prettyricky>	androver=== I did the sudo gedit /etc/x11/xorg.conf
08:51	<astro76>	MagoonD: look in /media
08:51	<phreakv6>	     /msg nickserv set unfiltered on
08:51	<GirlRiver>	arvind_khadri: do I have to stop GDM for that ? or what is the command
08:51	<arvind_khadri>	prettyricky, that should be gksu gedit
08:51	<JPSman>	Where can I get all of my codec?
08:51]  * rahul_ goes off to try grub
08:51	<JPSman>	s
08:51	<androver>	prettyricky: cool, so you replaced it with the stuff from that URL?
08:51	<ferris_>	bluefox83, still it is faster than firefox with out the plugin
08:51	<astro76>	prettyricky: and /etc/X11
08:51	<bluefox83>	ferris_, it's compiled for your specific processor, and it prolly does have some of the same features as that plugin
08:52	<MagoonD>	astro76, thanks man
08:52	<androver>	arvind_khadri: I always use sudo...why is gksu better?
08:52	<arvind_khadri>	GirlRiver, no need to stop GDM do this sudo dpkg -reconfigure xserver-xorg
08:52	<astro76>	androver: gksu for X (graphical) apps
08:52	<joe_>	So has anyone gotten their nvidia 8000 series cards to work with Hardy
08:52	<merlin_>	hell....today is my first time with linux, decided to do dual boot...killed my linux by bein stupid....then screwed up the bootsector...and while trying to fix it corrupted my windows
08:52	<astro76>	!gksu | androver
08:52	<ubotu>	androver: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use Â« gksudo Â», as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
08:52	<arvind_khadri>	androver, gksu should be used with X11 apps
08:52	<MagoonD>	how do i bring up the text editor from the terminal?
08:52	<androver>	thanks, i'm gonna read that link
08:52	<joe_>	merlin_: did you ever get to a decent resolution or still in 800x600?
08:53	<icesword>	MagoonD, gedit

08:53	<arvind_khadri>	nick_, yeah there are lots of them
08:53	<pclync1>	anyone willing to help fix my login issue?...
08:54	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: obviously the choice is yours in terms of what your security requirements are... but be sure to check the following:  1) WPA1 vs WPA2, 2) MAC Filtering, 3) PSK, and 4) SSID case, spacing, etc.
08:54	<merlin_>	actually i can get a decent resolution from the proprietary drivers...but i was kinda hopin to get the newest ones installed
08:54	<ferris_>	there is one for $40 that is multi-platform (win, mac, linux, beOs and several more than I can't remember)
08:54	<JKirk_>	can anyone see what I'm typing?  I've asked so many times with no response...
08:54	<ompaul>	NOTICE --- I am about to remove a lot of bans this will cause some scrolling

[08:54	<prettyricky>	I did this but nothing came up>>>>sudo gedit /etc/x11/xorg.conf
[08:54	<JKirk_>	so no one is willing to help then?
[08:54	<merlin_>	but the nvidia installer cant ftp the files it needs to complete the install so i need a sourccode download for hardy heron
[08:54	<osmosis>	how do I disable network manager so I can just set my interfaces in /etc/network/interfaces manually.
[08:55	<^rumput_kering^>	my laptop has a pcmcia modem card connected. i running the wvdial, and the modem is connected. but i can access or ping the internet. any one can help me?
[08:55	<androver>	MrRoboto: freeze your hard drive and plug it in again?
[08:55	<arvind_khadri>	prettyricky, use gksu !!!!
[08:55	<GirlRiver>	arvind_khadri: that complains with "dpkg: conflicting actions -e (--control) and -r (--remove)"
[08:55	<ompaul>	SONE -
[08:55	<prettyricky>	i remember I had to delete ## from a couple of the lines but I see no lines
[08:55	<ompaul>	DONE - even
[08:55	<astro76>	prettyricky: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, linux is case-sensitive
[08:55	<MrRoboto>	androver: what do you mean with freeze?
[08:55	<Narshil_>	Kr0ntab:got disconected, you still there?
[08:55	<mosibfu>	prettyricky, its case sensitive: X11, big letter x for that only
[08:55	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil_: yes
[08:55	<ferris_>	nick it is called PIXEL
[08:55	<JKirk_>	ok ...if no one can help with drive sharing, can someone help with proprietary drivers for a IBM T40 laptop?
[08:55	<ompaul>	JKirk_, people answer when they know or are not busy there are no obligations on anyone to help but they try
[08:55	<nick_>	arvind_khadri: IS there a website for looking for programs like that
08:55	<arvind_khadri>	GirlRiver, ok just  a min
08:55	<androver>	MrRoboto - sometimes you can recover a hard drive for long enough to get some files off of it by sticking it in the freezer for a while and then plugging it back in.  sometimes.
08:55	<joe_>	merlin_: by the way, if you type joe_: it will highlight the text for me when you are talking to me
08:56	<Narshil_>	Kr0ntab:still nothing
08:56	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil_: my last message was
08:56	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil: obviously the choice is yours in terms of what your security requirements are... but be sure to check the following:  1) WPA1 vs WPA2, 2) MAC Filtering, 3) PSK, and 4) SSID case, spacing, etc.
08:56	<JKirk_>	ompaul I know...just seems like SOMEONE would be helpful....
08:56	<MrRoboto>	androver: whoah are you serious?
08:56	<joe_>	merlin_: Did you go to synaptic and enable the source?
08:56	<merlin_>	joe_: ty, i did not know that
08:56	<duncan_>	Haii! can help me someone , java not working in the new firefox, and i can't install the java plugins in firefox, but i did install the java-sun-6.0 in the terminal... someone? :)
08:56	<androver>	prettyricky: replace the file with the URL i showed before.  make sure to back up the old one first, though.
08:56	<merlin_>	joe_: do what now? lol
08:56	<androver>	MrRoboto: yup.  it's true.
08:56	<JKirk_>	in the 8.04 beta, there was a shared folders menu item... in release it's gone.... wtf???
08:56	<ferris_>	JKirk, hold on a sec let....
08:56	<Repsa_Jih>	Hello. I really need to make a larger backup (about 30Gig) of my hard drive. Therefore, I want to copy these files to another computer (WinXP). What is the best and fastest way to do this?
08:56	<merlin_>	joe_: first day of linux remember? lmao
08:56	<astro76>	duncan_: sudo apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
08:56	<Narshil_>	Kr0ntab:yeah i just wantted to disable it for a sec just to make sure it wasnt the security that was messing the connection up
08:56	<GT>	Hey, somebody having resolution problems with Hardy!
08:56	<duncan_>	i did it!
08:57	<arvind_khadri>	GirlRiver, sorry that sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
08:57	<joe_>	merlin_: Go to System >	Administration >	Synaptic Package manager
08:57	<Narshil_>	Kr0ntab:but still no luck
08:57	<GT>	Oh, that was it.
08:57	<MrRoboto>	androver: even though, it's still spinning ...and it kinda shows in Computer "USB Drive" but it won't mount, and it says I/O Error
08:57	<joe_>	merlin_: and then look for the source code they want
08:57	<magnetron>	Repsa_Jih: some sort of rsync, i would say
08:57	<joe_>	merlin_: then right click and mark it for installation, then click apply
08:57	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil_: hrm.... lets get in a pm... this scrolling is rough
08:58	<Narshil_>	Kr0ntab:lol true, k
08:58	<bvk>	hi, is there a way to install .debs into $HOME of non-root users ?
08:58	<androver>	MrRoboto: it depends on what kind of errors you're getting.  it works if your hard drive is clicking.  paste some dmesg output into a pastebin and i'll look at it.
08:58	<joe_>	merlin_: then read the last error code when you do the sudo sh nvidia*
08:58	<Taejo>	androver, now I've got http://pastebin.com/d7166f93c
08:58	<joe_>	merlin_: it will tell you how to tell it where the file is, there is some syntax I forget
08:58	<joe_>	merlin_: and after all of that, it still won't work
08:58	<cute_bettong>	how do i upgrade from 5.04 to whatever is current?
08:59	<joe_>	:)
08:59	<tcpdumpgod>	Anyone know of a good CHM viewer or what program installed by default will read it?
08:59	<MrRoboto>	androver:  http://pastebin.com/m1e372ec there you go
08:59	<astro76>	cute_bettong: you'll need to clean install
08:59	<cute_bettong>	shit i don't have the dumb disk
08:59	<icesword>	hoho, 5.04
08:59	<icesword>	lol
08:59]  * cute_bettong sighs
08:59	<astro76>	cute_bettong: clean install the latest
08:59	<prettyricky>	I want to edit that file but I cant seem to be able to see it...
08:59	<JKirk_>	when I right click on a folder and try to share it, it says I don't have admin rights to share it.... wtf?
08:59	<nick_>	can amatures like me do anything for gnome
08:59	<Kr0ntab>	Narshil_: for pm you must register with nickserv...
08:59	<IndyGunFreak>	5.04?..LOL
08:59	<icesword>	lolololol
08:59	<cute_bettong>	astro76, not possible no blank cd or dvd
08:59	<arvind_khadri>	cute_bettong, update-manager -d
08:59	<cute_bettong>	thank you
09:00	<IndyGunFreak>	thats like using windows 3.x
09:00	<Narshil_>	Kr0ntab:aahh mmhh ok....how?
09:00	<astro76>	cute_bettong: except that won't work because the 5.10 repos are no longer up
09:00	<astro76>	!install | cute_bettong
09:00	<ubotu>	cute_bettong: Ubuntu can be installed in a lot of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall. Don't want to use a CD? Try http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
09:00	<icesword>	IndyGunFreak, but it can save lots of resource, and it just works, lol

09:04	<cute_bettong>	i don't understand how to do that
09:04	<IndyGunFreak>	arvind_khadri: np
09:04	<IndyGunFreak>	cute_bettong: don't understand how to do what?
09:05	<joe_>	Dr_willis: tell me more, how did you do it?  through synaptic or envyng?
09:05	<astro76>	orudie_: congrats, that's how it usually goes despite the impression you'd get watching this channel ;)
09:05	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  its in the normal repos/packages.. a simple apt-get install got it.
09:05	<joe_>	Dr_willis: Also, are you actually using the nvidia driver and not the nv driver?
09:05	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  i have NEVER needed to use envy.
09:05	<nick_>	i don;t get it a
09:05	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  I see the nvidia logo when X starts up, so its using nvidia.
09:05	<ubuntung-pinoy>	icesword: ever tried burning an audio disc project with brasero, and files are "loading" but nothing else happens?
09:05	<nick_>	Whats the diff between gnome and linux
09:06	<IndyGunFreak>	Dr_willis: lol, the fact they put envy in the repos now scares me
09:06	<IndyGunFreak>	brb
09:06	<martin_>	HI
09:06	<icesword>	ubuntung-pinoy, hmm, no
09:06	<arvind_khadri>	nick_, gnome is desktop enviroment
09:06	<astro76>	nick_: Linux is the kernel of the system, gnome is a desktop environment which runs on Linux
09:06	<yoyoo>	hiii
09:06	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  you might also want to install the nvidia config tools  to allow for tweaking the thing a bit.
09:06	<Dr_willis>	IndyGunFreak,  perhaps NOW the  thing will get bugs and security issues fixed. :)
09:06	<joe_>	Dr_willis: lemme try that
09:06	<ubuntung-pinoy>	icesword: would u know what to do if u did?
09:06	<nick_>	so is ubuntu a gnome
09:07	<toplok>	someone using 8.04 ?
09:07	<martin_>	I get an error while trying to upgrade to 8.04 from cd

09:08	<martin_>	I've tried to force it to install using the  command gksu "sh /cdrom..."

09:08	<newscane>	new drive is a 500 gig sata, attached to a sata controller, which i know linux has recognized (showed up in lspci)
09:08	<joe_>	Dr_willis: nvidia-cg-toolkit?
09:08	<martin_>	But it was useless
09:08	<ubuntung-pinoy>	toplok: info on that error would help
09:08	<ferris_>	toplok, i don't know how to do that, but I am sure others will send it to you...
09:08	<jintxo>	Hello there. Was woindering if somebody knew a way of making ubuntu (8.04) not use compiz and just use metacity. I have "No desktop effects" selected but it's still running compiz and gtk-window-decorator. cheers :-)
09:08	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  nope. thats not it. :) i did need that tool for somthing.. but thats not the nvidia-xconfig tool
09:08	<nick_>	d_wills: don;t understand o well

09:10	<orudie>	newscane, maybe your computer is trying to bood from the 500 gig
09:10	<toplok>	the desktop effects are gone
09:10	<razel>	anyone who knows more about wireless?? :(
09:10	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  i dont knwo about that. I installed all 3 at the exact same time.  and this was a few weeks ago.
09:10	<newscane>	i looked at the bios... the IDE controller card is set to boot before the sata card

09:12	<newscane>	overall boot order is cd >	removable media >	hd >	network
09:12	<androver>	razel: ok, that makes sense, what's wrong with the wireless?  does it show up under ifconfig?
09:12	<newscane>	within HD, it's add-on cards >	IDE >	sata
09:12	<joe_>	Dr_willis: Ok, I have all three installed, and when I run nvidia-xconfig all it gives me is a corepointer error for the keyboard and mouse
09:12	<orudie>	newscane, i'm not too sure, but there is a chance you should configure grub boot loader
09:12	<simplexio>	newscane: where did you but that grub
09:12	<newscane>	grub is on the IDE drive
09:13	<newscane>	it boots fine when i unplug the sata drive

09:14	<Dr_willis>	joe_,   I dident have that issue. if you just installed the nvidia-glx drivers. You 'should' be able to restart the X server and it 'should' see the nvidia card and start using it. You MIGHT have to enable it in the restricted-managers tool

09:15	<hangthedj>	when i uninstall it, it uninstalls ubuntu-desktop and firefox, reinstalling these two automatically installs firefox-3
09:15	<orudie>	newscane, are you getting any errors ? what is exactly happening when you connect your new sata drive ?
09:15	<newscane>	with the sata drive in, this is what i get as i boot:
09:15	<IndyGunFreak>	hangthedj: it doesn't remove ubuntu desktop.. thats just a meta-ackage
09:15	<simplexio>	newscane: does it boot from livecd ?

09:16	<ubuntu_>	I'm currently on the Live CD
09:16	<simplexio>	newscane: if it boots from livecd and sata work under it, you have messed grub or kernel
09:16	<IndyGunFreak>	not very smart.
09:16	<androver>	ubuntu: so reinstall it?
09:16	<razel>	androver: i did whats next?
09:16	<ubuntu_>	how would I reinstall it?
09:16	<androver>	razel: gimme the url for the paste
09:16	<jhaarman>	ubuntu_ on wiki is info on that
09:16	<hangthedj>	it says firefox-2 is already the newest version, and if i run firefox-2 it loads firefox-3 beta 5
09:16	<ubuntu_>	would sudo apt-get install grub --reinstall work?
09:17	<ferris_>	IndyGunFreak, my install was horrible.... well, the install on two machines were flawless on 8.04, but the configuring the wireless took me about 20 minutes, after I pulled my head out of a dark place.... on the old pc, no problems at all.
09:17	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  i had that issue for a while also.. then it fixed itself..
09:17	<razel>	androver: im using a wired internet right now...
09:17	<rothchild>	I've got a borked install of msttcorefonts that I can't seem to get rid of or fix can anyone help?
09:17	<hangthedj>	Dr_willis,  how did it fix itself?
09:17	<newscane>	orudie: i get the gateway splash, then it recognizes the IDE card and the IDE drive, then the sata card and the sata drive, then a blinking cursor.  it also made some drive noises (sounded like the floppy and the ZIP drive going).  no error msg
09:17	<IndyGunFreak>	ferris_: hmm, mine was fairly smooth on my PC and Laptop.... i set my wireless up the same way I did in gutsy(with a madwifi patch because my device gets misdetected).
09:17	<androver>	razel: i need you to tell me the URL that the pastebin gave you for what you pasted
09:17	<guest59>	Androver: I'll try. Please wait a moment.

09:18	<IndyGunFreak>	actually, i don't think i had any problems on either machine..lol

09:19	<hangthedj>	running firefox-2 runs firefox-3, but if you launch it from the internet menu it runs firefox-2
09:19	<nick_>	dr_wills: ok only been on 7 for about 2 days
09:19	<IndyGunFreak>	i don't like Firefox's new download manager.. the old one was better(when doing multiple downloads)
09:19	<joe_>	Dr_willis: I used to have restricted drivers as an option, but its gone now
09:19	<rothchild>	I think it's because I had privoxy installed but I don't any more
09:19	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  no idea. Im not using gnome.. and i dont have the menus memorized
09:19	<monkeybritches>	hardy-wtf: Is it the screensaver?
09:19	<orudie>	newscane, does the grub boot loader shows up ?

09:20	<hardy-wtf>	let me turn it off and see
09:20	<pclynch>	can anyone help me with grub boot manager?

09:20	<ubuntung-pinoy>	anyone know what to make of this? audio/x-asf-unknown decoder plugin
09:20	<orudie>	newscane, my guess is that you have to try and get the grub configured for this new hard drive and for your system hard drive
09:20	<acidicbase>	anyone have a detailed changelog for 8.0.4 release?
09:21	<hardy-wtf>	no it is not the screensaver

09:21	<ferris_>	IndyGunFreak, they were both smooth. I was impressed that it was the easiest installs ever. I have literally installed over 1000 times. From win95 to vista, BeOs, RH, GENTOO, Debian (many versions of it) but Ubuntu 8.04 was incredibly easy. I thought they did a particularly nice job on the manual partitioner
09:21	<hardy-wtf>	i can duplicate it
09:21	<timandtom>	8.04 isn't recognizing my wireless card automagically and giving me the option to install the drivers like 7.10 did. How do I find/install drivers for it? They're restricted drives. Wireless card is: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX (rev 02)

09:24	<IndyGunFreak>	ferris_: is it still th beta, or based on 2.0.whatever was stable?
09:24	<pclynch>	cvd-pr: can you describe the problem better?
09:24	<Taejo>	androver, restarting seems to have cleared the authentication error, now I just have "[Job 151] No %%BoundingBox: comment in header!"

09:24	<IndyGunFreak>	ferris_: and where did you get it, i don't see it in the repos, or does it need compiled?
09:24	<hardy-wtf>	is there a way i can install from the internet?
09:24	<razel>	androver: this page ->http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64476/?
09:24	<hardy-wtf>	from the live cd?
09:24	<cvd-pr>	pclynch, the video can't keep the standard framerate
09:24	<rothchild>	timandtom have you enabled the additional repos with the restricted bits?
09:24	<hardy-wtf>	maybe i have a scratch on this disk

09:25	<newscane>	putting the ide card explicitly as the first option in hard drive booting changed nothing
09:25	<Dr_willis>	hardy-wtf,  i think theres a very minimal net-isntall cd you can get.. but the server load will make that a bit slow.
09:25	<ferris_>	IndyGunFreak, you can get it through spm, but you have to add the repos.
09:25	<nano_>	quick question: are the *.iso images of ubuntu "bootable images"
09:25	<steel_lady>	Hi! Can somebody suggest me a program where I can put a lot of links and tell it to start downloading four of them, when one finishes, to start with the next one etc...?
09:25	<hardy-wtf>	hmm
09:25	<ferris_>	i can give you the repos in a sec
09:25	<IndyGunFreak>	ferret: spm?  got a link
09:25	<astro76>	nano_: yes
09:25	<rothchild>	nano_ yes they are
09:25	<nano_>	thanx!!!
09:25	<hardy-wtf>	i am out of cd's
09:25	<cvd-pr>	pclynch, jumpy DVD playback
09:25	<nano_>	so i guess i just need to do a "write to cd"
09:25	<hardy-wtf>	i wish i could just switch to net from here
09:26	<GT>	Why does Hardy hate my screen??
09:26	<timandtom>	rothchild: Yes, that's the first thing I do now, since before when I installed you had to do that to get flash...
09:26	<GT>	And how can I get them to play nice?
09:26	<androver>	taejo: i'm searching for an answer for you
09:26	<rothchild>	nano_ you have to 'burn image' rather than just add the iso file to the project
09:26	<cvd-pr>	Enabling DMA?
09:26	<Dr_willis>	GT,  most likely its a videocard/driver/monitor issue. :) depends on the details.
09:26	<nano_>	rothchild...Thnx
09:26	<hardy-wtf>	well i have an edgy disk laying around here
09:26	<pclynch>	cvd-pr, hmmm i don't know where you should start. Are you sure you have all requirements for dvd playback and there up to date?
09:26	<Taejo>	androver, I already googled "pstocapt boundingbox" and some variations

09:27	<rothchild>	hardy-wtf if you go with edgy you have a long upgrade route do you have a dapper disk instead?
09:27	<cvd-pr>	pclynch,  yes
09:27	<jube>	Anyone know where the settings are saved for gThumb?
09:27	<rothchild>	then you've only got a one stage update
09:27	<hardy-wtf>	only edgy
09:27	<natalie>	Hello People!
09:27	<androver>	taejo: you're about as far as I am, then.  try changing "LogLevel warning" to "LogLevel Debug" in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and check out the error log after that.
09:27	<natalie>	I have qemu0.82 and I would like to use 0.9 because that one supports the qcow2 format.
09:27	<androver>	razel: yeah, I think it'll work.
09:27	<natalie>	whats a good way to update qemu0.82 to qemu0.9?
09:27	<natalie>	the qemu website says "download this and extract in /". but that sounds rather scary.

09:28	<earthcreed>	 I looked to see if there was a sound or alsa group I could add myself to, but I did not see one.  This may be an ubuntustudio problem, since, in the upgrade to 8.04, I switched to the studio version.

09:29	<rothchild>	it's been a while since I played with a broadcom I think you need ndiswrapper?

09:29	<earthcreed>	nick- Try Maxima.

09:29	<toplok>	what a mess I have with 8.04. I guess I may need to reinstall from zero... the upgrade was terrible
09:29	<rothchild>	not ndiswapper?

09:30	<jube>	astro76, thank you so much. I found it in the gconf-editor under apps and was able to clear the film setting so it doesn't default to the wrong film name

09:30	<androver>	earthcreed: they switched to pulseaudio in 8.04.  Wine, at least, doesn't have a pulseaudio driver working yet so they do some compatibility stuff with OSS.  Not that that helps :)
09:30	<toplok>	is there a way to save all emails from evolution ?
09:30	<astro76>	nick_: I'm partial to Scilab, haven't used Octave much... Scilab is not "free software" but is free and open source
09:30	<timandtom>	rothchild: No idea :( In 7.10, it just automatically asked me if I wanted to enable the restricted drivers for the card, so I did. If I use the "Hardware Testing" option in System>Administrator, then it detects what it is, but that doesn't help any. It just tells me it's name
09:30	<Taejo>	androver, I didn't notice anything meaningful in the huge spam debug logging caused

09:38	<rothchild>	yes but I can't purge the package either (and I don't think the site is gone)

09:40	<timandtom>	rothchild: Actually... I seem to remember that the light for my wireless card doesn't turn on in WinXP either. Could this be something other then just a driver issue? It only started after I installed 8.04 and XP though, so that's why I figured it was this...

09:43	<MrRoboto>	sjovan: I know it's a dumb question, but I want to install another distro ... something maybe ..more challenging but tight, I was thinking about slackware
09:43	<drwx>	Hi I have got a big problem with my wifi card broadcom 4306, it dont works on hardy. someone has the solution?
09:43	<timandtom>	astro76: And, the light USED to work on 7.10

09:43	<ferris_>	bigtimer21, that should get you going.
09:43	<IndyGunFreak>	64bit is so so much better faster, etc forget the fact its a pain in the ass to get anything to work! it rocks!

09:44	<negge>	IndyGunFreak of course it's what everyone should be using when everyone has a 64-bit processor

09:46	<androver>	by the way if anyone runs plone, the upgrade to hardy will break it.  beware.
09:46	<cvd-pr>	IndyGunFreak,  the DMa
09:46	<negge>	IndyGunFreak think about it, if everyone who could would use 64-bit OSs, then we'd have great drivers in a matter of weeks

09:46	<`rob->	IndyGunFreak: hardy wiped out my /
09:46	<IndyGunFreak>	negge: but thats just not the reality of it, and i hate dealing w/ the constant issues of dealing w/ 64bit... whne its actually ready i'll use it.
09:46	<harfg>	so to release seems utterly against the ethos of debians workingness
09:46	<eeboy>	Cool... I see it under /mount. Gotta get used to everything appearing as files. Terminal highlights some of them in different colors and backgrounds. Is there a listing of the meanings somewhere?

10:22	<blame>	vistakiller: I did, it fixed the turn off problem but it disabled the installed driver
10:22	<oddalot>	lartza_ so why don't you write a java program...i was assuming you know java if you are dealing with jar files
10:22	<blame>	Steve14_ub: I did, but to no avail.

10:23	<astro76>	IndyGunFreak: hahaha
10:23	<lartza_>	I noticed there is a LOT of crap on same folder as jar so I think I'm gonna do it by hand

10:24	<jerry13>	I can acess them through "computer" anyway.
10:24	<Dr_willis>	ditoa,  why is it divx specific? :) i tend to use gmplayer for my needs.
10:24	<oddalot>	best dilbert strip EVER ->	http://darjeelink.com/2007/11/26/dilbert-on-agile/
10:24	<Jagged|>	chivaknievel: nah it's about releasing that no ones listen to you and desiding to fix it yourself :P
10:24	<MttJocy>	RudyValencia, I believe that the difference between /dev/hdx and /dev/sdx drives is how they are physically connected to the system (and therefore how they are seen from the kernel's perspective) however I could be wrong and I'm not sure which one refers to what maybe someone else could confirm that (and perhaps explain better than I can)
10:24	<timandtom>	rothchild: :( No luck. And I made sure to leave it on when I restarted
10:25	<RudyValencia>	OK
10:25	<ditoa>	just because everything i have is divx/xvid :)
10:25	<lartza_>	oddalot:Yea it would be pretty simple. It should search all .jar ended files and position the filename after href= correctly, but I'll do it hand
10:25	<blame>	vistakiller: do I have to remove the drivers currently installed priror to executing envyng?
10:25	<vistakiller>	no
10:25	<vistakiller>	just install them with envyng
10:25	<oddalot>	lartza_ in fact
10:25]  * IndyGunFreak wonders how long before this envyng thing in the repos blows up
10:25	<chivaknievel>	fixing isnt a problem
10:25	<oddalot>	lartza_ you could write a unix script and not even have to compile it
10:26	<RudyValencia>	Oh, What relationship does Ubuntu have to Debian? Is it still "Ubuntu is a more up-to-date, user-friendly fork of Debian"?
10:26	<chivaknievel>	but i just expect more i guess
10:26	<Dr_willis>	MttJocy,  that used to be how it worked. but now the changes in the kernel make most/all ide drives also show up as sd devices.
10:26	<chivaknievel>	from ubuntu
10:26	<lartza_>	odda lot: I knew that and wondered why you started to talk about java, but there are only like 50 files left after all crap deleted
10:26	<MttJocy>	Dr_willis, Oh right, didn't know that.
10:26	<vistakiller>	chivaknievel wait then for updates
10:26	<chivaknievel>	i guess thats a good plan
10:26	<Dr_willis>	MttJocy,  its due to cleanup of the ide and drive subsystem code from what ive read.
10:26	<ditoa>	what package is gmplayer listed under? i cannot find it in synaptic?
10:26	<Dr_willis>	ditoa,  apt-cache search mplayer
10:27	<chivaknievel>	im annoying i know
10:27	<chivaknievel>	and im sorry
10:27	<ditoa>	ahh gnome-player ;)
10:27	<chivaknievel>	but i really respect ubuntu
10:27	<Dr_willis>	expect more what? :)
10:27	<RudyValencia>	Oh, What relationship does Ubuntu have to Debian? Is it still "Ubuntu is a more up-to-date, more user-friendly, community-oriented fork of Debian"?
10:27	<oddalot>	lartza_ k
10:27	<chivaknievel>	and i want it to succeed
10:27	<astro76>	!debian | RudyValencia
10:27	<ubotu>	RudyValencia: Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/relationship - Remember, !repositories meant for Debian should NOT be used on Ubuntu!
10:28	<chivaknievel>	but all of these problems are the sort of thing that will make it fail
10:28	<Dr_willis>	!debian
10:28	<Dr_willis>	RudyValencia,  with each new release of ubuntu -  - the differances grow and grow. it seems. I think its beyond a 'fork' stage now.

10:29	<momal>	Since upgrading to hardy from gutsy (kubuntu) kaffeine just gives me: "Loading of player part 'XinePart' failed. All Videos Drivers failed to initialize!" Anyone have any ideas what the problem is?
10:29	<vistakiller>	the have it
10:29	<timandtom>	7.10 recognized my wireless card and automatically installed the restricted drivers for it. Since I switched from 7.10 to a 8.04/WinXP dual boot, the wireless card won't turn on at all(In WinXP or 8.04, yet it works in a 7.10 LiveCD). Anyone have any ideas how to fix this?
10:29	<vistakiller>	blame you dont find it?
10:29	<lartza_>	with java jar i get Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jar
10:29	<MttJocy>	You know, I wonder why, especially when there is a new distribution update that puts a lot of pressure on the update servers (or it seams to be, my computers online update tool is downloading them now) have they ever considered making it so that the online distribution upgrade tool has the option to fetch the distribution update via torrent rather than hitting the update servers directly, I am sure given the option quite a few users would choose it and
10:29	<MttJocy>	it could help reduce the peak load the update servers get on release day, or is there some reason this is technically not possible?
10:30	<RudyValencia>	So Ubuntu might now be considered "offspring of Debian"?
10:30	<xipi>	hi
10:30	<pteague_laptop>	astro76>	ah, ok thanks... i'm trying to run icewm on my laptop as it's a bit low on resources... unfortunately wireless doesn't seem to auto connect unless i log into gnome
10:30	<IndyGunFreak>	amerio: i have tat same device working w/ madwifi.. no probs here, are ou sure the ESSID of the network you want is broadcasting?
10:30	<xipi>	what does the address 192.168.0.0/24 mean?
10:30	<chivaknievel>	you can upgrade via the install cd
10:31	<astro76>	xipi: /24 means a netmask of 255.255.255.0
10:31	<chivaknievel>	download the alternate cd
10:31	<blame>	vistakiller: which packages do I need?

10:31	<amerio>	IndyGunFreak: yeah im very sure , the day before yesterday I had gutsy with wireless working and detection is ok ! i didnt edit any of router settings , when I installed hardy yesterday it just stopped
10:31	<lartza_>	is there anyway to run hone jar progs on ubuntu?
10:31	<xipi>	astro76: so all ips from 192.168.0.0 - .255?
10:31	<astro76>	xipi: so that's specifiying a network from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 with a netmask I mentioned
10:31	<lartza_>	hne >	phone

10:32	<xipi>	astro76: thanks for the clarification
10:32	<IndyGunFreak>	amerio: hmm, very strange.. sorry, no logical explanation
10:32	<oddalot>	24 is a number of bits?

10:33	<IndyGunFreak>	amerio: i hve no clue.. sorr
10:34	<Ubuntu-Noob>	im on 7.10 at the mo
10:34	<astro76>	Ubuntu-Noob: it should work fine, but as always backup your files if they are important
10:34	<linux__alien>	i installed Ubuntu 8.04 everything works expect the NVIDIA driver. when i installed the Nvidia driver i just get a white screen. I use a NVIDIA Ge-Force 8400 M GS Card in my Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop
10:34	<linux__alien>	is there a wor around for this?
10:35	<MttJocy>	timandtom, Regards your wireless card no longer being detected after the distribution upgrade, perhaps you should submit a bug report with the details of your card etc, check nobody else has already posted one though.
10:35	<lartza_>	could someone write me script to delete all files under 35kt from a folder?
10:35	<timandtom>	amerio: I've been asking in here for a while too, no one seems to have any idea :( I'm thinking about just going back to 7.10 for a bit, especially if it turns out to be  Ubuntu specifically, not just the card not working at all(Haven't tried on XP yet)
10:35	<Exteris>	linux__alien, i have the same card, only the non-mobile version, and the restricted drivers manager should handle them fine
10:35	<astro76>	lartza_: that should be one find command
10:35	<astro76>	lartza_: well, find piped to xargs
10:35	<elmargol>	Someone knows how I can see if an application uses XV?
10:35	<Exteris>	but linux__alien you should pastebin the contents of: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
10:35	<timandtom>	MttJocy: Thanks, already did though. But, that doesn't help me get it working NOW :(
10:36	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i just get a white screen ok  i ll do that i ll enable that driver and then paste the contents of pastebin
10:36	<amerio>	timandtom: I had that problem in gutsy and spent like a week to fix it , i dont want to suffer again
10:36	<linux__alien>	Exteris, currently i am using X without xorg.conf i ve delete the file
10:36	<linux__alien>	Exteris, is it possible to paste it now ? or should i enable it again and paste it?
10:36	<Exteris>	linux__alien, you should have renamed it
10:36	<timandtom>	Well, I'm out for the night. I'll try again tomorrow if it works in WinXP... Or just reinstall 7.10 if not. Farewell.
10:36	<Exteris>	linux__alien, uhm no you need the log with the errors in it
10:36	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i still have a backup though
10:37	<lartza_>	astro76: Kinda amateur and didn't find script from google.
10:37	<timandtom>	amerio: Ah, that sucks. Everything worked perfectly right out of the box for me with 7.10. It was really a great way to get introduced to Linux.
10:37	<eeboy>	Dr_willis, when a user logs in is what I am after
10:37	<chivaknievel>	this is such a mess, if upgrading is going to cause so many problems to so many people, what is the point of the every 6 month upgrade?
10:37	<linux__alien>	Exteris, so should i rename the file and again try logging into X and then copy the xorg.log and paste it?
10:37	<MttJocy>	timandtom, To be honest not sure how to help you there, presumably something in the upgrade has broken the support for that card I guess, maybe someone else who has your card who is cleverer than me might figure out a workaround till it is fixed with some luck (either that or it gets fixed soon)
10:37	<Exteris>	linux__alien, restore the backup, restart the xserver, it fails, then copy the log to another file and paste it
10:37	<linux__alien>	done will do it now

10:43	<tcpdumpgod>	bigtimer121, did you use the .bin file provided by nvidia.com or did you install it through APT?
10:43	<bigtimer121>	APT
10:43	<tcpdumpgod>	alienseer23-eee it probably screwed your xorg.conf up.
10:43	<emorris>	if I want to upgrade from gutsy to hardy using a cd, do I need a desktop or alternate cd?

10:44	<howlingmadhowie>	lartza_: the easiest way would be to install  a mobile phone emulator
10:44	<tcpdumpgod>	bigtimer121, you should be able to just uninstall all the nvidia packages installed VIA APT then.
10:45	<alienseer23-eee>	tcpdumpgod: suggestion?

10:46	<lartza_>	yea i realized i should search with linux not ubuntu
10:46	<tcpdumpgod>	you should be able to CapsY
10:46	<tcpdumpgod>	just back your current one up.
10:47	<alienseer23-eee>	tcpdumpgod: no good
10:47	<lartza_>	from sun might be best since java has been made by them
10:47	<CapsY>	oddalot: yes ,but when i set it to nvidia driver ,X server tell me that None display has usable configuration

10:52	<blame>	vistakiller: this envyng gadget is a thing of beauty, the drivers work flawlessly! thanks!
10:52	<linux__alien>	Exteris, Can you look into that please?
10:52	<CapsY>	tcpdumpgod: yes, but when i change driver to NVIDIA (which i used before update to hardy) xserver tell me that diplays hasn't usable configuration
10:52	<delarooney>	how do I fix a mistake in sources.list
10:52	<CapsY>	:(
10:52	<oddalot>	capsy...maybe you don't have the displays on a good setting
10:52	<vistakiller>	blame is the only way no to install the driver in hardy
10:52	<linux__alien>	When i enable the NVidia Driver in 8.04 i just get a white screen . I ve a 8400M GS Card
10:52	<Saladin>	So, I guess no-one knows about my Flash sound issue?
10:52	<biabia>	I figured out my problem with my install, all my hard drive device names were changed so they were wrong in my fstab, i just had to manually mount them and edit the fstab
10:52	<CapsY>	when i use NV driver and i run counter-strike under wine i get ChoosePixelFormat failed
10:52	<vistakiller>	i dont why they break the official tools
10:53	<tcpdumpgod>	CapsY, did you set the monitor config there also?
10:53	<CapsY>	yup
10:53	<blame>	linux__alien: use envyng I just fixed my problem with that tool.
10:53	<CapsY>	i will try again
10:53	<alienseer23-eee>	Q: sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm should set the gnome login to it's defaults, right?
10:53	<Exteris>	linux__alien, sure
10:53	<RudyValencia>	OK, I'm setting up my Ubuntu server to do virtual hosting under Apache, where should I be putting my virtual hosts' DocumentRoot(s)?
10:54	<lartza_>	how can i see cpu tempereture?
10:54	<adante>	does some program exist yet that will do a scan for me and make an xorg that has the right resolutions for my screen/video card?
=== wwwjfy is now known as some
10:54	<linux__alien>	blame you have the same card?
10:54	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i ve pated the URL
10:54	<linux__alien>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64481/
10:54	<adante>	at the moment the ubuntu screen res app is capable of 2 resolutions: 640x480 and 1600x1200 - i was hoping for something in between
=== some is now known as wwwHIT
10:54	<linux__alien>	This is the URL if you have not noticed
10:54	<CapsY>	my video card is nvidia FX 5200 and my monitor is NEC FE770
10:55	<blame>	linux__alien: now but after few days of battling with my card to no avail I've tried envyng and it works fabulous
10:55	<Exteris>	linux__alien, i have the same card, and it works fine, but i don't see any errors in it
10:55	<linux__alien>	you want me to use envyng
10:55	<linux__alien>	Exteris, the same card worked perfectly with 7.10
10:55	<alienseer23-eee>	GOT IT!
10:56	<alienseer23-eee>	aparently there was no driver specified in the xorg.conf file
10:56	<CapsY>	i will restart X to try is it working
10:56	<alienseer23-eee>	"sudo nvidia-xconfig" worked for me
10:57	<snikker>	after kernel upgrade (2.6.22-14 to 2.6.22-16 in herdy) one of my ide hard disk is not recognized as well. At boot i've a console prompt, i must press ctrl-d to go away, than start gui, but the hd is not accessible. how can i fix this?
10:57	<lartza_>	how can i see cpu tempereture?
10:57	<linux__alien>	Exteris, what do i do
10:57	<Exteris>	linux__alien, uhm, try uninstalling the driver from the drivers manager, and use either envyng or the drivers from nvidia.com
10:57	<linux__alien>	Exteris, any clues please?
10:57	<pure_x01>	Hello everyone..  is there a top 10 tips of stuff to do when you have just installed 8.04 .. i had it for 7.10 and it was pretty useful.. codecs, flash, fonts etc..

10:58	<Exteris>	jpatrick, sudo aptitude install lm_sensors
10:58	<RudyValencia>	I'm setting up my Ubuntu server to do vhosts under Apache. I used to put my vhosts' DocumentRoot(s) in /hosts/(domainname)/(subdomain) - where should I be putting them?
10:58	<Exteris>	jpatrick, and then 'sensors' after that
10:59	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i am just installing the driver using envyng
10:59	<jpatrick>	Exteris: interesting, didn't know that
10:59	<snikker>	no ones can help me?
10:59	<Exteris>	jpatrick, look into hddtemp too

11:00	<jpatrick>	Exteris: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64482/
11:00	<tcpdumpgod>	I compiled a pretty cool Gnome theme if anyone is interested.
11:00	<El1>	Hi guys, when I install nvidia-glx package there are no proprietary drivers in drivers manager, is this normal?
11:01	<Exteris>	jpatrick, oh i think it's lm-sensors
11:01	<voron_>	flower sudo ifcobfig eth0 up
11:01	<vistakiller>	El1 you have the driver?
11:01	<voron_>	ifconfig * sry
11:01	<jpatrick>	Exteris: there we go
11:02	<El1>	vistakiller: first of all kickass name, and I don't have any drivers showing in the hardware drivers window, so I don't think I have the driver
11:02	<alienseer23-eee>	so, firefox lost all of it's add ons and bookmarks after the upgrade...is there aknown bug?
11:02	<fserve>	flower try ifconfig eth0 up
11:02	<vistakiller>	the hardware driver window have problem
11:02	<El1>	vistakiller: altho when I try nvidia-glx-new it does show a proprietary driver but it doesn't work
11:02	<dani>	edi
11:02	<tcpdumpgod>	flower, try "ifup eth0"
11:02	<vistakiller>	and is break you will not see the driver there
11:02	<TerrorBite>	Note to all Ubuntu users
11:02	<TerrorBite>	When upgrading
11:02	<vistakiller>	try to run glxinfo in terminal
11:03	<TerrorBite>	make sure /tmp is not mounted noexec
11:03	<vistakiller>	and see there if is any nvidia or mesa and tell us
11:03	<emorris>	ï»¿TerrorBite: please write things all on one line
11:03	<koala_man>	can I hibernate to a swap file on an encrypted disk?
11:03	<TerrorBite>	emorris, sorry, forgot
11:03	<emorris>	;-)
11:03	<El1>	no nvidia or mesa, just Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
11:03	<El1>	and Error: couldn't find RGB GLX visual
11:03	<jpatrick>	Exteris: ah well, no sensors found
11:04	<linux__alien>	Exteris, what the package that envyng downloads and whats the package thats downloaded by the hardware tool for configuration NVIDIA card
11:04	<vistakiller>	ok what is your gpu card?
11:04	<Exteris>	jpatrick, too bad :(
11:04	<tobago>	i installed vpnc client onto my pc and the connecting is working. but when i start the vpnc then the firefox can't access the net anymore. what can i do?
11:04	<linux__alien>	whats the difference between these two drivers
11:04	<El1>	nvidia 6700XL, I also tried envy and the binary drivers from nvidia
11:04	<Exteris>	linux__alien, no idea, i don't know about envy
11:04	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, i ve a Nvidia Ge-Force M 8400 GS
11:04	<flower>	voron, error while getting interface flags, not right app
11:04	<vistakiller>	guys try envyng from synaptic
11:04	<cappy_>	it doesnt work :@
11:04	<vistakiller>	and let it auto to install the driver
11:05	<El1>	I tried that vista, but when I restart X it says no driver is detected
11:05	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, i am installing the driver using envyng currently
11:05	<cappy_>	when i change drivers to NVIDIA and restart Ubuntu is running in low-graphics mode
11:05	<El1>	and it asks me to run in low-res mode
11:05	<fserve>	How i can make a hidden shared folder with samba? in windows is just name+$ but it does not hide from samba users...
11:05	<El1>	seems it's a general problem then
11:05	<vistakiller>	cappy the same with the others
11:05	<cappy_>	and when i click Configure i see that drivers are changed to vesa
11:05	<cappy_>	:@
11:05	<voron_>	flower, nano /etc/network/interfaces
11:05	<vistakiller>	yes it is general problem
11:05	<cappy_>	fuck that
11:05	<vistakiller>	this prblem exist from alpha
11:05	<voron_>	what do u see there?
11:05	<El1>	cappy_ try installing the nvidia-glx packages instead of nvidia-glx-new: that will atleast eliminate the resolution problem
11:05	<vistakiller>	but no one fix it
11:06	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, i get a white screen when i enable Nvidia driver which i had installed using restricted manager now i am trying with envyng
11:06	<El1>	altho there's no gfx acceleration
11:06	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, the same card worked perfectly with 7,10
11:06	<vistakiller>	i know and my card was working
11:06	<El1>	same here alien
11:06	<cappy_>	i will try again
11:06	<vistakiller>	8800gts but when i upgrade to alpha it stop
11:06	<El1>	so no fix has been found for this problem yet?
11:06	<flower>	tcpdumpgod, ignoring unknown interface: eth0=eth0
11:06	<fserve>	How i can make a hidden shared folder with samba? in windows is just name+$ but it does not hide from samba users...
11:06	<vistakiller>	yes and the strange is that the problem exist from alpha
11:06	<cappy_>	but why they do it that way
11:06	<cappy_>	:@
11:07	<Zaqq>	hi. does anyone know the channel for WUBI ?
11:07	<tcpdumpgod>	flower, whats the problem you're having?
11:07	<Distue>	hello
11:07	<El1>	well, until there's a fix best thing is to just install nvidia-glx instead of nvidia-glx-new so you can atleast run in proper resolution
11:07	<cappy_>	im installing nvidia-glx now
11:07	<alienseer23-eee>	something is wrong with firefox, it won't import ANY data from the previouse instal, does anybody know how to resolve this?
11:07	<flower>	fserve, error while getting interface flags, not right app
11:07	<TerrorBite>	ugh
11:07	<El1>	ok cappy_
11:07	<flower>	tcdumpgod, eth0 doesn't show up in the networkmanager... no internet
11:07	<vistakiller>	El1 the best way is to install them with envy
11:07	<TerrorBite>	Having a 3.5GB / == no upgrade
11:07	<El1>	then it's even worse
11:08	<El1>	so no
11:08	<cappy_>	and firefox3 BETA 5 stuck a lot of time

11:08	<vistakiller>	nothing else is working
11:08	<Distue>	somebody up for a question? i ve read a "set up full disk encryption in a dual boot system" howto in theubuntuforum. there he uses dmcrypt for linux and truecrypt for win. there is a way to encrypt a whole hdd with truecrypt. wouldn't be that the same result? does anybody know if this would be secure enough?

11:17	<oddalot>	three steps...
11:17	<vistakiller>	yes downlad it
11:17	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, if i get the driver used in 7.10 it should be fine
11:17	<flower>	tcpdumpgod, no no luck ...
11:17	<Otman>	Oddalot i know apt  ant etc i want to learn commands ...
11:17	<vallhalla81>	i am having trouble with firefox and flash player i have both installed but when i try to use a site such as youtube it sayes i need to install flsh player can any one advise please
11:17	<astro76>	thenetduck: but you probably don't have them both on the r61
11:17	<vistakiller>	and after istall it with envyng
11:17	<thenetduck>	astro76: I am getting used to the red dot, its actually really useful
11:17	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, is it possible to gte that?
11:17	<astro76>	thenetduck: yeah I love it :)
11:17	<thenetduck>	I guess you just have to use it correctly
11:17	<tcpdumpgod>	flower, does it return anything?
11:17	<kc>	is there any way to restore a XP hard drive from ubuntu?
11:17	<vistakiller>	there is an option to use envyng the driver that you have download
11:18	<thenetduck>	astro76: do you have a ThnkPad?
11:18	<flower>	tcpdumpgod, no
11:18	<tcpdumpgod>	vallhalla81 did you install it through the package management system, or through the file provided by Adobe?
11:18	<tcpdumpgod>	flower,
11:18	<tcpdumpgod>	try this one
11:18	<kc>	xp boot "fixer" killed the data :(
11:18	<astro76>	thenetduck: yes a T61... since I use the middle click a lot in firefox and to paste, I love that it has three buttons
11:18	<emorris>	ï»¿MajSh: create a launcher (or just run)   gnome-terminal -x screen
11:18	<vallhalla81>	ï»¿tcpdumpgod: i have tryed both ways
11:18	<oddalot>	otman, you have to cd through the source to libxmms then type sudo ./configure  then type sudo make  then type sudo make install
11:18	<tcpdumpgod>	sudo dmesg |grep -i pci
11:18	<MajSh>	emorris: trying now. thanks
11:18	<tcpdumpgod>	tell me if that returns anything.
11:19	<TerrorBite>	oddalot, IMO you only need sudo for the make install stage
11:19	<thenetduck>	astro76: I just got mine Yesterday, I don't really know where to start when it comes to getting skype working because I am a 64 bit user as of today :)
11:19	<flower>	tcpdumpgod, is it |grep or | grep
11:19	<oddalot>	terrorbite you are probably write, i just always use sudo because i don';t know what i';m doing
11:19	<emorris>	ï»¿flower: doesnt matter
11:19	<thenetduck>	astro76: do you know how to get skype working with the video camera and adio?
11:19	<oddalot>	right*

11:19	<jgoo>	ips
11:19	<emorris>	ï»¿MajSh: my pleasure
11:19	<tcpdumpgod>	vallhalla81, paste me the results of this command "sudo find /usr/ -name libflashplayer.so"
11:19	<astro76>	thenetduck: no I don't have a camera
11:20	<TerrorBite>	oddalot, my general rule is: Only use sudo if it says "Permission denied" or "You must be root" if you run it without
11:20	<tcpdumpgod>	flower, either
11:20	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, after i download the driver from nvidia.com how do i install it?
11:20	<thenetduck>	astro76: oh, bummer.. the camera works with cheese out of the box, i am happy about that
11:20	<vallhalla81>	/usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree/libflashplayer.so
11:20	<Otman>	whene i type sudo make i see this make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
11:20	<oddalot>	terrorbite, of course....but you don't have to worry if you use sudo every time
11:20	<thenetduck>	astro76: what does the middle button do in Linux?
11:20	<tcpdumpgod>	vallhalla81, are you using firefox?
11:20	<RudyValencia>	I'm setting up my server to do vhosts under Apache. I used to put my vhosts' DocumentRoot(s) in /hosts/(domainname)/(subdomain) - where should I be putting them?
11:20	<thenetduck>	astro76: can't figure out what it does
11:20	<vistakiller>	i think there is an option from envyng to install them
11:20	<voron_>	Otman, ./configure
11:20	<vallhalla81>	i am yes
11:20	<Dr_willis>	thenetduck,  pastes the selected test normally.
11:20	<Otman>	i did ./configure
11:21	<tcpdumpgod>	ok vallhalla81
11:21	<tcpdumpgod>	paste this
11:21	<oddalot>	terrorbite guess i will get better at learning which ones use which over time
11:21	<voron_>	Otman, what did it say?
11:21	<oddalot>	didn't even know about this gksudo until tonight
11:21	<tcpdumpgod>	actually
11:21	<pisse>	My sound in Firefox doesn't work. Same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=708907
11:21	<tcpdumpgod>	vallhalla81, whats your username on your machine you're working on?
11:21	<thenetduck>	Dr_willis: oh cool
11:21	<astro76>	thenetduck: well there's the select to copy, middle click to paste thing... in gnome if you middle click on a window title it will send to back... in Firefox it will open links in new tabs, or close tabs
11:21	<vallhalla81>	ï»¿tcpdumpgod: dave
11:21	<tcpdumpgod>	ok hold
11:21	<oddalot>	otman you are probably going to have to do sudo apt-get build-essential

11:21	<vallhalla81>	ï»¿tcpdumpgod: ok
11:22	<oddalot>	sudo apt-get install build-essential

11:22	<oddalot>	and also some others..
11:22	<tcpdumpgod>	okay dave, ready to paste?
11:22	<astro76>	thenetduck: a few examples ;)
11:22	<thenetduck>	astro76: sounds nifty

11:22	<tcpdumpgod>	then close and reopen firefox and try a flash site again.
11:22	<linux__alien>	vistakiller, i guess i ve to go back to 7.10
11:22	<linux__alien>	again
11:22	<linux__alien>	7.10 was really good
11:23	<linux__alien>	didnt find any problems as such
11:23	<El1>	afaik it's not possible to downgrade
11:23	<TerrorBite>	I haven't upgraded from 7.10 yet
11:23	<tcpdumpgod>	lol@the name cocaine_eyes
11:23	<linux__alien>	E11 i ll have to remove 8.04 and install 7.10 again
11:23	<vistakiller>	linux-alien this is a general problem
11:23	<El1>	so just install nvidia-glx for the time being so you can run in proper resolution
11:23	<TerrorBite>	not enough disk space to do an upgrade. Using an eeepc with a 4GB SSD
11:23	<vistakiller>	wait they will fix it
11:23	<vallhalla81>	ï»¿tcpdumpgod:  ln: creating symbolic link `/home/dave/.mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so': File exists
11:23	<oddalot>	otman do sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2-dev
11:23	<astro76>	thenetduck: there is info out there on using it to scroll... and if you did that you could use Emulate3Buttons in xorg.conf to get your middle click back (you'd press left and right together to get middle)
11:23	<El1>	do the devs actually know about this?
11:23	<cappy_>	same is with nvidia-glx
11:23	<cappy_>	:@:@:@
11:23	<Otman>	Okay now im downlonding  sudo apt-get build-essential
11:23	<tobago|away>	when i start the vpnc-client, all other apps (firefox, irc) are blocked. what might be the reason?
11:23	<astro76>	thenetduck: so it depends on your preference
11:23	<linux__alien>	E11 nvidia-glx ?
11:23	<tcpdumpgod>	vallhalla81, im going to private message you.
11:23	<vistakiller>	i think there will be a bug report
11:24	<El1>	yes, instead of nvidia-glx-new  you install the nvidia-glx package
11:24	<vistakiller>	too many peolple have the problem
11:24	<cappy_>	yup
11:24	<El1>	that shut down the resolution problem for me
11:24	<linux__alien>	hmmm makes sense
11:24	<linux__alien>	let me do that
11:24	<Otman>	oddalot Query me
11:24	<linux__alien>	how do i do that
11:24	<linux__alien>	apt-get install nvidia-glx?
11:24	<thenetduck>	astro76: I like this set up a lot better, now that I know how to use it. It just gives me more options
11:24	<El1>	synaptic :P
11:24	<ModplanMan>	Well hallo thar, I recently compiled 2.6.25 kernel, and methinks the rndis_wlan module (needed to make my USB wireless work) might be intefering with me sound
11:24	<El1>	got to synaptic search for nvidia-glx, remove nvidia-glx-new and install nvidia-glx
11:24	<cappy_>	El1: nvidia-glx doesnt work for me, i get same error :(

11:25	<tobago|away>	how to run the vpnc and the firefox at the same time without the vpnc blocking the firefox?
11:25	<tcpdumpgod>	okay, just wanted to make sure you were typing correctly flower

11:25	<tcpdumpgod>	press up on your keyboard, erase pci

11:25	<FloodBot2>	tcpdumpgod: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
11:26	<linux__alien>	E11 was this the version in 7.10 ?
11:26	<El1>	no it's 8.04
11:26	<Otman>	oddalot no i have'nt
11:26	<cappy_>	i tried and official drivers from nvidia.com
=== linkipit is now known as Linkipit
11:26	<cappy_>	but same with them
11:26	<El1>	did you uninstall those first before you reinstalled nvidia-glx package?
11:26	<linux__alien>	E11 any idea on the version of the driver used in 7.10 ?
11:26	<Otman>	oddalot Query me again
11:26	<tobago|away>	somebody here experinces with vpnc?
11:26	<El1>	envy should work for 7.10
11:26	<tobago|away>	experiences
11:26	<Vertelemming>	I'm having a strange problem where new windows don't show up on top, and don't grab the focus. They always appear just below the topmost window, whatever that may be. I've been poking at the configuration, but I'm afraid I'm a bit stumped.
11:26	<cappy_>	no just typed sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx and they removed the new ones
11:27	<astro76>	El1: envy is not recommended if you want to be able to upgrade
11:27	<linux__alien>	E11 no in 7.10 i installed the driver using restricted packages and it just wored
11:27	<oddalot>	otman query me i guess
11:27	<El1>	for me too, but not in 8.04
11:27	<vistakiller>	is there a bug report?
11:27	<linux__alien>	so i want the version of the driver used in 7.10
11:27	<Dr_willis>	fserve,  You might want to install the samba-doc package and check out the samba books it contains. I dont know the answer off hand. but i bet its in there. ) was thinking the 'hidden' share feature was a rather insecure gimmic really last i read about it.  Linux samba browsers can find/see them just fine since they are really not hidden.
11:27	<Otman>	oddalot im using xhcat
11:27	<Otman>	xchat *
11:27	<vistakiller>	linux_alien is the same version with here

11:30	<tcpdumpgod>	backspace pci in the last command you typed
11:30	<zeno>	Chrysalis: 6 or 5?
11:30	<tcpdumpgod>	and replace it with eth and run the command again.
11:30	<Crash91>	i want to install GRUB to the /boot partition, not the MBR, does the installer let me choose this?
11:30	<Chrysalis>	6
11:30	<bimo>	at home capy
11:30	<obnibolongo>	astro76, yah I bought a all Intel laptop just not to worry about closed source drivers (ok, 3945's firmware is closed-source, but better than a Broadcom driver ^^)
11:30	<zeno>	sun-java6-jre
11:30	<cappy_>	the only solution is to use NV drivers
11:31	<cappy_>	but i dont get 3D accel
11:31	<obnibolongo>	astro76, I honestly doubtX3500 will be that better... Intel cards == free but sucky cards :P
11:31	<zeno>	Chrysalis: also maybe sun-java6-plugin
11:31	<Dr_willis>	Crash91,  i was thinking the alternative-installer cd - allowed that.. the desktop-cd-installer does not.

11:32	<pisse>	I need help with my Firefox sound. It doesn't work (flash) but I get sound from totem.. how do I fix this?
11:32	<astro76>	obnibolongo: well there's only so much you can do without being a separate chip... if they only made graphics cards
11:32	<Dr_willis>	dreamcoder,  You may want to tell everyone what brand/model video card  as well.
11:32	<zeno>	dreamcoder: put it first in the resolutions of /etc/X11/xorg.conf
11:32	<anto>	pisse,  sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer

11:33	<pisse>	vistakiller: yeah, I've read that but I don't know anything about that.. you know how to fix it?
11:33	<Crash91>	i read on a thread that only the alternate CD can let you do that
11:33	<zeno>	Crash91: you gotta do manual partitioning
11:33	<nonewmsgs>	Crash91:  yes
11:33	<Crash91>	does the regular desktop CD have that option
11:33	<zeno>	maybe not worth it :?)
11:33	<vistakiller>	i dont know only if you use alsa
11:33	<pisse>	vistakiller: I use alsa
11:33	<Crash91>	zeno: im not concerned about partitioning, just whether it will let me choose
11:33	<Wibble->	Is there any program that can undelete on ext3? A program I'm using just deleted stuff it should not have done!
11:34	<Crash91>	zeno: 1GB swap, 4GB OS, and how big should the /boot be?
11:34	<zeno>	Crash91: it wont give you a GUI choice, you gotta set it up manually with the partitioning tool
11:34	<zeno>	not sure sorry
11:34	<sushi_>	hi i just installed ubuntu on a 800mhz celeron with 756mb ram and graphic onboard the problem is that either the system or gnome is running very slow

11:40	<astro76>	sushi_: not usually
11:40	<Noiano>	hello
11:40	<brakkvatn>	Something horrible happened. Ubuntu 8.04 didn't warn me that my laptop barrery was getting empty, instead it just powered off.
11:40	<linux__alien>	I just want to paste the contents of XServer
11:40	<Exteris>	IntangibleLiquid, you must be tired then :P
11:40	<Crash91>	i have a Dell Inspiron 6400, so im guessing ubuntu will support most of its features?
11:40	<Zacaa>	oddalot: are you talking about the resolution?
11:40	<IntangibleLiquid>	Exteris: lol
11:40	<astro76>	!laptop | Crash91
11:40	<ubotu>	Crash91: Laptop support information can be found on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops - http://www.linux-laptop.net/ - http://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam - http://tuxmobil.org
11:40	<Noiano>	I have a laptop with a vga out to connect a projector: the projector receives signal only in text mode...why?
11:41	<LebLinux>	hello, I just updated the packages on Hardy and the Update Manager is showing me 1 Distribution update called: "libgtk1.2" in Grey, I can't update it any ideas why?
11:41	<pteague_laptop>	obnibolongo>	nothing wrong with it... just that i should have gone to bed several hours ago & instead got stuck reading something interesting
11:41	<obnibolongo>	pteague_laptop, ah ok :P
11:41	<linux__alien>	Exteris, can you look into this please?
11:41	<linux__alien>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64486/
11:42	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i ve now captured the errors of X Server
11:42	<|ns|nR8>	anyone have trouble installing xmms on 8.04 ?
11:42	<linux__alien>	Exteris, The xorg.conf used here is the one that worked with 7.10
11:42	<s__>	I have downloaded the new verison and am using it as a live cd. I would like to know how to connect to the internet. I have a netgear dg834pn wireless router and a wpn111 adapter. I'm a complete newbie to ubuntu but use windows a lot.
11:42	<Noiano>	or, at least....what could be the reason for it?
11:43	<oddalot>	Zacca, i was joking, i don't know about the problem :/
11:43	<astro76>	|ns|nR8: apparently xmms is no longer in hardy, it's a dead project anyway, you should try xmms2 or audacious
11:43	<zeno>	|ns|nR8: wasnt xmms like discontinued?
11:43	<Exteris>	linux__alien, hmm there should be a log wth more information :(, but i gtg, sorry
11:43	<|ns|nR8>	hmm... well xmms2 is a command line player
11:43	<|ns|nR8>	i want gui
11:43	<|ns|nR8>	aww i liked xmms ...
11:44	<Crash91>	if i choose to manually edit partition table, will it then let me configure where it installs GRUB?
11:44	<regis>	by the way i had a problem with a nvidia card...that i resolved...should i bugreport or describe my procedure somewhere? in the wiki?
11:44	<sushi_>	thx for the help
11:44	<ganteng>	yes a grou a partisi thi disk
11:44	<LebLinux>	hello, I just updated the packages on Hardy and the Update Manager is showing me 1 Distribution update called: "libgtk1.2" in Grey, I can't update it any ideas why?
11:44	<sushi_>	cu later i hope i can make ubuntu a little bit faster right now its impossible to work with it
11:44	<zeno>	|ns|nR8: i usually just use mplayer =p
11:44	<ganteng>	mmgmm
11:44	<astro76>	|ns|nR8: audacious is the continuation of xmms and I think it supports it's skins and such
11:45	<|ns|nR8>	thanks ill try it out astro76
11:45	<flower>	tcdumpgod, here is my network file: http://rafb.net/p/BDof8p93.html
11:45	<fserve>	how add folders, to audacious?
11:45	<sushi_>	is its ture that kde is faster than gnome?
11:45	<obnibolongo>	|ns|nR8, audacious == xmms
11:45	<obnibolongo>	|ns|nR8, minus mp3cue support I guess
11:45	<lividity>	sushi_: Not in my opinion
11:45	<obnibolongo>	fserve, select them as if they were files
11:45	<oddalot>	|ns|nr8   someone just posted the deb for xmms a second ago
11:45	<cappy_>	!nvidia
11:45	<ubotu>	For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
11:46	<obnibolongo>	sushi_, kde is "slicker" than Gnome without compiz
11:46	<cappy_>	!xconf
11:46	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about xconf - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
11:46	<|ns|nR8>	yeah ive got the deb..but i cant install some dependencies yada yada
11:46	<obnibolongo>	sushi_, not faster
11:46	<s__>	I have downloaded the new verison and am using it as a live cd. I would like to know how to connect to the internet. I have a netgear dg834pn wireless router and a wpn111 adapter. I'm a complete newbie to ubuntu but use windows a lot.
11:46	<lividity>	sushi_: You want a fast window manager go with fluxbox
11:46	<|ns|nR8>	ill just try out audaciou
11:46	<fserve>	ohh, thank ya, sorry, obnibolongo
11:46	<obnibolongo>	fserve, no prob
11:46	<yao_ziyuan>	let's imagine there is a trojan/virus
11:46	<oddalot>	|ns|nr8 i compiled it fine, you need like the build-essential and two other packages i think
11:47	<yao_ziyuan>	it spawns multiple processes as seen in ksysguard
11:47	<yao_ziyuan>	if you kill one, the others recover it
11:47	<|ns|nR8>	oh ok thanks oddalot
11:47	<jsoftw>	Hmmm, my right hand alt does something different to my left alt..
11:47	<yao_ziyuan>	this is a common scenario in windows
11:47	<yao_ziyuan>	how do we deal with it?
11:47	<RudyValencia>	how do I setup Apache vhosts so that Samba can access their contents?
11:47	<Crash91>	if i choose to manually edit partition table, will it then let me configure where it installs the bootloader??
11:47	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, you start offering with update-manager a Malware Removal kit ?  :P
11:47	<yao_ziyuan>	back in the windows days, i have to recover the system registry and system files from another clean windows installation
11:48	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, safe mode and clean start scripts
11:48	<zeno>	obnibolongo: i thought i saw some benchmarks that kde was slightly faster than gnome
11:48	<zeno>	but not much
11:48	<s__>	how can i connect to the internet using a netgear wpn111 adapter
11:48	<zeno>	anyways fluxbox eats both alive
11:48	<yao_ziyuan>	well,
11:48	<obnibolongo>	zeno, ok, didn't know :)
11:48	<yao_ziyuan>	there is a difference: in windows, i'm always an administrator
11:48	<lividity>	x2 for fluxbox
11:48	<tiara>	hai
11:49	<yao_ziyuan>	obnibolongo: can start scripts be modified by a virus using my normal user account?
11:49	<Dr_willis>	how do you even benchmark a windowmanager/desktop?
11:49	<bebraw>	has someone gotten blender work well on hardy (using desktop fx)?
11:49	<fserve>	ouvindo[Linkin Park - Live in Texas - Numb] length[0:59/3:08]
11:49	<dreamcoder>	now i have tried gnome i am not sure which i prefer gnome or kde grrrrrr
11:49	<dreamcoder>	i hate choices
11:49	<Dr_willis>	yao_ziyuan,  a normal user can alter their own files. thats it.
11:49	<zeno>	yao_ziyuan: they need root
11:49	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, no
11:50	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, but never understimate the power of social engineering
11:50	<zeno>	are there any linux virii atm?
11:50	<yao_ziyuan>	well, actually, i just woke up, after dreaming exactly that windows scenario
11:50	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, I don't know how easy it is to install a .deb with a binary setuid root
11:50	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, but shouldn't be too hard
11:50	<LebLinux>	hello, I just updated the packages on Hardy and the Update Manager is showing me 1 Distribution update called: "libgtk1.2" in Grey, I can't update it any ideas why?
11:50	<yao_ziyuan>	bill gates is bin laden in the binary world
11:51	<zeno>	yao_ziyuan: nah totally different; he wants money; laden wants to spread religion
11:51	<yao_ziyuan>	and/or in collaboration with FBI/CIA
11:51	<obnibolongo>	yao_ziyuan, and do note that exploits live the vmsplice() thingy appear from now and then to allow local privilege escalation, e.g., be root without password
11:51	<yao_ziyuan>	bill gates can get money from CIA/FBI/DOD budgets
11:51	<yao_ziyuan>	for his contribution to global exploitation
11:51	<icesword>	dod
11:52	<g0th>	hi
11:52	<g0th>	I just upgraded my ubuntu and I still have several issues
11:52	<zeno>	yao_ziyuan: i wouldnt doubt they got some for putting in back doors, but how do they contribute to global exploitation
11:52	<zeno>	!ask | g0th
11:52	<ubotu>	g0th: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
11:53	<icesword>	lol
11:53	<alado>	how do i force my 2 extra internal hdd's to shut down/spin down, i had it working before but forgot about how i did it, as i remember it i set some parameters for them in a terminal.
11:53	<obnibolongo>	Bill Gates is a person who wants money and to have a good life. Do not underestimate him and others like him, though they may have the so called "wrong" motivations, they do work(ed) hard to get where they are. That serves as no excuses to they possible bad behaviour, but they do deserve some credit, even if some of the credit is due to someone else not doing their jobs well
11:53	<zeno>	alado: unmounting them will do it
11:54	<g0th>	for starters the kernel. I copied .config from my old kernel configuration to the new kernel source, did make menuconfig (did some modifications) and then run make-kpkg binary-arch but it failed with the following message: http://rafb.net/p/z4fgSa94.html
11:54	<zeno>	alado: or a mount option (read manpage)
11:54	<alado>	zeno: no, i want them to automatically spin down whe they are not in use
11:54	<otarid>	anyone got 8.04 to detect nvidia cards at start up? I tried enabling restricted drivers, reconfiguring xserver, using the binary, using envy, modifying xorg.conf, but I keep getting into a low graphics mode when I boot. I'm using the -14 kernel version from the grub menu because I couldn't get my 3945 network card to work with the newer kernel :<
11:55	<LebLinux>	hello, I just updated the packages on Hardy and the Update Manager is showing me 1 Distribution update called: "libgtk1.2" in Grey, I can't update it any ideas why?
11:55	<astro76>	alado: you probably used hdparm or sdparm
11:55	<obnibolongo>	otarid, 3945 working nice here
11:55	<zeno>	otarid: yes, but it did automatically so dont know how to help :(
11:55	<obnibolongo>	otarid,  2.6.24-16-generic
11:55	<relix>	Hey
11:55	<paines>	hi
11:55	<relix>	I'm trying to install Hardy Heron on my dad's PC (now running windows)
11:55	<flower>	tcdumpgod, here is my etc/network/interfaces: http://rafb.net/p/sCgVrL74.html
11:55	<alado>	astro76: yes thats it! thnx i'll look into it again
11:55	<jsoftw>	How do I make my right hand alt work the same as the left hand alt? I notice in emacs the right hand alt does not work
11:55	<otarid>	obnibolongo: nvidia works with that but then I can't get the network card to work (no wireless)
11:55	<g0th>	hmm then my whole compiz setup is totally messed up. I just saw white rectangles instead of windows/bars. So I did "metacity --replace". If I open new windows then they Ã¶ppl better but there are still the strange white window decorations around
11:55	<jsoftw>	whereas the left hand one is fine..
11:56	<relix>	migration assistance is not detecting the users on windows xp
11:56	<g0th>	s/Ã¶ppl/look/
11:56	<obnibolongo>	otarid, 3945 working nice here, in  2.6.24-16-generic
11:56	<relix>	anyone know what I can do to troubleshoot this?
11:56	<otarid>	obnibolongo: not for me :(
11:56	<zeno>	otarid: try ndiswrapper, and your windows driver
11:56	<alang_babega>	HI room...  i need some help in indonesian language... Pleease..!!!
11:56	<obnibolongo>	otarid, hardy 8.04 final?
11:56	<paines>	my system locks up when i switch on an external usb drive(i cannot give in anything, mouse freeezes etc), and when i turn it off system works normal again. external drive works okay with another system. any idea ?
11:56	<otarid>	obnibolongo: yes
11:57	<otarid>	zeno: ndiswrapper didn't work
11:57	<obnibolongo>	zeno, he shouldn't have, 3945 is fully supported by iwl3945 driver
11:57	<carl->	my mother uses the nvidia driver and made an upgrade yesterday to hardy .. after that the resolution seems to have gone crazy and is just really small now ..
11:57	<otarid>	everything used to work fine in 7.10
11:57	<Otman>	oddalot send me that link of xmms again please !
11:57	<carl->	anyone experiences with this problem
11:57	<Darkchef>	carl : is it nvidia 6100 by any chance?

11:58	<minimec>	sorry to repeat myself... I need to set gdm to option 'reload' as default behavior when I logout, instead of restart... I do not find something in gdm.(custom).conf. Do you know, where I can find this option?
11:59	<carl->	Darkchef:  oops .. not a good option .. i support my mother remote .. through ssh
11:59	<otarid>	that gives me nothing, obnibolongo

11:59	<Darkchef>	carl - the live cd of hardy booted fine on my pc, when gutsy used to give me strange resolutions
11:59	<otarid>	obnibolongo: I'm on the -14-generic kernel though

12:14	<gavinreddrop>	Hello all, I have just upgraded to 8.04 fresh install, and I am having trouble with the sound. I had the same trouble with 7.10 but was hoping that 8.04 would fix the problem. When I click on the volume control I get the following error: The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that...
12:14	<gavinreddrop>	...you don't have a sound card configured.                After that error is displayed I get this error when I click on it: No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.     I have searched though the forums with no avail and now I am here....  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated..
12:14	<LebLinux>	zeno: no it doesn't do it ... still kept back
12:14	<sofiankr1>	zeno: there's just one problem, the wireless thing on my computer is not lighted up...
12:14	<gavinreddrop>	by the way I am a n00b
12:14	<livingdaylight>	koudelka, you de man....
12:14	<dreamcoder>	ok not trying to start any arguments, but I like gnome and kde and cant decide which one
12:14	<zeno>	LebLinux: sorry i dont know :( try ##linux
12:14	<koudelka>	livingdaylight, np :)
12:14	<dreamcoder>	i dont want to install both
12:14	<emorris>	ï»¿gavinreddrop: hav you enabled extra repositories
12:15	<livingdaylight>	koudelka, why did you say in your case? you not using gnome?
12:15	<jimqode>	dreamcoder, then use fluxbox :)
12:15	<Fritzel>	is virtualbox processing power dynamic?
12:15	<dreamcoder>	havent tried that
12:15	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, Don't go there
12:15	<jimqode>	dreamcoder, it was a joke
12:15	<dreamcoder>	i cant decide between ubuntu or kubuntu
12:15	<sofiankr1>	zeno: how do I switch it on?
12:15	<dreamcoder>	ubuntu seems more refined
12:15	<zeno>	sofiankr1: not sure, maybe it just lights up when you are connected?
12:16	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, if you need help finding out which one to use, go to #gnome and #kde and ask them why you should use it
12:16	<livingdaylight>	dreamcoder, its a tough choice i agree
12:16	<dreamcoder>	ok
12:16	<sofiankr1>	dreamcoder: I tried Kubuntu, really did not like it
12:16	<koudelka>	livingdaylight, no, but if you insert cd's or something you change the preferred application menu. but for opening a file with a special program you rightclick and go to preferences
12:16	<silentlamb>	i prefer gnome
12:16	<sofiankr1>	zeno: no, it used to light up at all times
12:16	<livingdaylight>	koudelka, gotcha
12:16	<silentlamb>	its lightweight compared to kde
12:16	<dreamcoder>	i like the refinement of gnome but like the fuctionaility or kde
12:16	<koudelka>	livingdaylight, i just was too fast reading your question :P
12:16	<Fritzel>	gnome is ugly >< but it works, therefore is my choice

12:17	<sofiankr1>	dreamcoder: the best kde distro in my opinion is mepis

12:20	<linux__alien>	i dont know what to do with 8.04 now :(
12:20	<koudelka>	linux__alien, what's the problem?
12:20	<errpast>	silentlamb, that's not fun, the effects are cool On a previous box of mine (5150 Dell) it would crash it.

12:21	<silentlamb>	so wat do suggest
12:21	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: ok
12:21	<linux__alien>	koudelka, i installed 8.04 and installed Nvidia Driver now i just get a white screen. I have a Nvidia Geforce 8400 M GS Card
12:21	<thouters>	is it possible to (for example) mount the hardy install cd loopback under gutsy and have it install a fresh hardy install on a LVM volume?
12:21	<errpast>	silentlamb, I'm thinkingt
12:21	<koudelka>	silentlamb, have you tried reinstalling vlc?
12:21	<linux__alien>	koudelka, this card worked perfectly with 7.10
12:21	<errpast>	silentlamb, not sure about the vlc conflict
12:21	<sofiankr1>	goodbye everyone!
12:21	<crashanddie>	thouters, yesterday someone mounted the CD on a loopback device, and installed from there
12:21	<silentlamb>	yeah purged reinstalld it working now
12:21	<errpast>	silentlamb, maybe lspic the video board, then google that
12:21	<linux__alien>	koudelka, just have a look at this

12:21	<crashanddie>	thouters, couldn't be more specific than that though, sorry
12:21	<zeno>	linux__alien: when do you get the white screen? i fixed an nvidia problem by using --nosplash
12:21	<errpast>	silentlamb, for the think pad, there is a great "think wiki" site that addresses this sort of thing
12:21	<thouters>	crashanddie: thanks. will check the logs
12:22	<silentlamb>	ok
12:22	<errpast>	silentlamb, yes, that will list the details of your hardware
12:22	<errpast>	silentlamb, gives another clue

12:23	<joemac>	Did an upgrade, now it can't find /etc/fstab, so can't boot
12:23	<koudelka>	linux__alien, try and uninstall the nvidia driver and reinstall it, alternatively you can use envyng to install the latest nvidia driver
12:23	<silentlamb>	ok
12:23	<crashanddie>	joemac, at what point does it stop working, does it still boot (electrically), do you get to Grub, maybe even a splash screen ?
12:23	<errpast>	silentlamb, about 2 years. It's great, but the hardware stuff can be very frustrating
12:23	<linux__alien>	koudelka, did that too but no use

12:23	<emorris>	ï»¿gavinreddrop: can you not get any sound, have you tired testing the sound from system>prefs>sound
12:23	<crashanddie>	joemac, boot on a livecd, mount the disk, and edit /etc/fstab until it works
12:23	<Ceox>	no
12:23	<linux__alien>	koudelka, the problem still exists
12:23	<joemac>	I get the splash screen then something calling itself ASH
12:23	<silentlamb>	yeah i know been away from linux for about 3yrs
12:23	<koudelka>	linux__alien, you have tried envy too?
12:23	<linux__alien>	yes
12:23	<silentlamb>	jsu got bk again
12:23	<errpast>	silentlamb, that's why I was thinking of maybe returning my Lenovo, and going for a thinkpad. The support on think wiki site is grewat
12:24	<joemac>	tried /dev/hd1

12:24	<linux__alien>	koudelka, is it possible to get the 7.10 driver ?
12:24	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: Does the device show on the NetworkManager in the top right corner?

12:28	<silentlamb>	now we get to how to use tools like kismet, aircrack, wireshark etc
12:29	<brakkvatn>	crlcan81: Booting from a usb stick should work
12:29	<crashanddie>	crlcan81, there is a new functionality on the CDs that allows you to install Linux from within windows, you might want to look into that, just mount the CD with a virtual CD player (daemontools comes to mind)
12:29	<errpast>	silentlamb, with the "N" standard, wireless is becoming as fast as wired
12:29	<crlcan81>	*s8ghs* I'm sorry but I ain't got those
12:29	<koudelka>	linux__alien, in that post you got sent it seems to be a fix
12:29	<crlcan81>	there's NO way to mount the ISO like a CD?
12:29	<emorris>	ï»¿gavinreddrop: can't help, sorry
12:29	<thouters>	is it possible to install hardy, from gutsy on a new LVM volume using debootstrap ?

12:29	<linux__alien>	koudelka, which one ?
12:29	<zeno>	crlcan81: -o loop
12:29	<linux__alien>	koudelka, whats the fix
12:29	<errpast>	silentlamb, yes. those are cool tools. the place i used to work used kismet in an embedded way.
12:29	<crashanddie>	crlcan81, of course you can
12:29	<crlcan81>	Otherwise I gotta go through a bunch of bitchiness from my mom
12:29	<zeno>	crlcan81: lrn to google =op

12:30	<crlcan81>	cause I got the WORST version of Linux one time.
12:30	<brakkvatn>	crlcan81: That will work
12:30	<errpast>	silentlamb, security and wireless is a hot area. I've been in 802.11, but am learning about wimax

12:30	<errpast>	huibuh, whassup
12:30	<crashanddie>	crlcan81, please stop complaining, we don't do psychic support, look into daemon tools and the app that allows you to install from within windows

12:31	<errpast>	huibuh, any thoughts. I would lspci, then google. No magic, unless I'm missing something. he's not crashing, just not getting effects

12:32	<zeno>	koudelka: more than i did i just googled =-p
12:32	<crashanddie>	joemac, are you on the livecd atm ?
12:33	<linux__alien>	koudelka, i just have to run sh nvida-file right
12:33	<linux__alien>	?

12:33	<materthron>	hey guys! why does " sudo echo "blacklist intel_rng" >>	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist" give me a permission denied error?
12:33	<errpast>	huibuh, good point.  It was Intel graphics I think.
12:33	<koudelka>	linux__alien, yes, but you have to do it from commandline, and close gnome and xserver
12:33	<Bits>	how is the transition between gutsy and hardy like? are there many known issues?
12:33	<used1>	greetings 2 all
12:33	<zeno>	materthron: add a sudo to the front

12:34	<linux__alien>	koudelka, will do that
12:34	<MttJocy>	joemac, It is *NOT* /dev/hd1 it will be /dev/hda or /dev/sda depending on the disk type, try those.
12:34	<emorris>	ï»¿joemac: specify the mount direcotry eg mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1

12:34	<linux__alien>	koudelka, and see whether it works and be right back here
12:34	<errpast>	huibuh, I loaded it up yesterday on my new Lenovo 3000. Wireless and Berly effects great. Need to work on the sound. Alsa driver issue. I need to backport I think
12:34	<joemac>	tried both those too

12:35	<errpast>	huibuh, do you run a laptop. I've just bought a Lenovo. Like I say, it's pretty good with 8.04, except sound. I think that will be a half hour task with backports to get working.

12:36	<errpast>	huibuh, desktops so much easier from the linux hardware perspective
12:36	<crashanddie>	joemac, which will allow you to correct previous mistakes, or errors

12:42	<MttJocy>	joemac, cat /etc/fstab
12:42	<emorris>	ï»¿theom3ga: have you tried sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
12:42	<theom3ga>	emorris: I'll give it a try
12:42	<joemac>	cat /etc/fstab : no such file or directory
12:42	<MttJocy>	Oh dear
12:43	<joemac>	oh dear
12:43	<MttJocy>	Seams your fstab file is missing
12:43	<zeno>	theom3ga: or just do sudo vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf and put the res you want in front
12:43	<crashanddie>	joemac, could you issue "mount" and give us the results ?
12:43	<materthron>	zeno: i've got an ati and i'm using the restricted driver
12:43	<crashanddie>	joemac, also, what are you using to access the linux computer ?
12:43	<dns-en>	Hi Im looking for some help with these damn ATI drivers been trying for 2 days just get blck screen after enabling
12:43	<joemac>	I tried that, comes up with couldn't find /etc/fstab
12:43	<Zacaa>	emorris: I have the same problem as theom3ga, and when i run dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org I get a fatal error telling me 'error inserting battery' do you maybe have any idea what that could be?
12:43	<errpast>	Bits, My Lenovo was about $600. 3000 n410. Your Asus is a little out of my price range
12:43	<errpast>	Bits, at least until I get a job :)
12:44	<Zacaa>	I'm using a desktop pc
12:44	<crashanddie>	joemac, what interface are you in ?
12:44	<zeno>	materthron: ver  173.08?
12:44	<theom3ga>	zeno: emacs >	vim ;)
12:44	<joemac>	err, think ash
12:44	<errpast>	Bits, What humps did you hit? I see it's got an nvidia card, so you needed the prop drivers.
12:44	<crashanddie>	joemac, hmm, k
12:44	<joemac>	is that what you mean?
12:44	<Bits>	errpast: if you do get the cash, don't buy it... .great machine but has heating issues. too packed for its own good
12:44	<crashanddie>	joemac, yeah
12:44	<errpast>	Bits, was sound ok on the A8j?
12:44	<juuj>	HI!
12:44	<emorris>	ï»¿Zacaa: don't know, sorry, bit of an odd one
12:44	<crashanddie>	joemac, could you fdisk /dev/sda ?
12:44	<crashanddie>	joemac, then hit "p"
12:44	<joemac>	ok, hang on
12:45	<crashanddie>	joemac, and tell me what it finds
12:45	<MttJocy>	joemac, Can you do this command for me
12:45	<MttJocy>	ls /dev/hd* /dev/sd*
12:45	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, he's going to find a bunchload of files, no use, he has to type everything again
12:45	<materthron>	zeno: how do i find that out?
12:45	<errpast>	Bits, thanks.  the EEEPC 9 inch looks fun. By getting a low end Lenovo for $600 (another $100 for 4 MB), I figure I can spend another $300 or $400 on the EEEPC
12:45	<joemac>	comes up: fdisk not found
12:45	<Bits>	errpast: sound and graphics worked fine out of the box. networking took a bit of tweaking and advanced graphics took a bit of xorg tweaking. fan still needs to be tweaked and instability occurs with advanced desktop effects (something with the window titles)
12:45	<errpast>	Bits, I'm waiting for the 9 inch model though.  It's only 2 pound!
12:46	<crashanddie>	joemac, djeezus
12:46	<ghostlines>	does leaving modules in your kernel slow you down, or only leave the kernel a bit larger?
12:46	<zeno>	-g2g nite all
12:46	<errpast>	Bits, interesting. When you say fan tweaking, are you talking BIOS?
12:46	<crashanddie>	ghostlines, the whole point of using modules is that they're *not* in the kernel
12:46	<zeno>	materthron: try the version referenced in post 35
12:46	<MttJocy>	joemac, Just do that command I said, and tell me what it comes up with
12:46	<zeno>	lates
12:46	<errpast>	Bits, I think my Lenovo 3000 needs a fan tweak, but my googling tells me maybe BIOS related.  I haven't dug in there yet.  It makes this louzy clicking sound. I thought maybe it was broken
12:46	<errpast>	Bits, But when I GG, I see others have fan issues
12:47	<materthron>	zeno: i'm using an ati, not an nvidia. the post you're refering to is for nvidia
12:47	<MttJocy>	joemac, ls /dev/hd* /dev/sd*
12:47	<g0th>	re
12:47	<g0th>	I had a crash, sorry
12:47	<crashanddie>	g0th, "re" doesn't mean anything in english ;)
12:48	<crashanddie>	g0th, keep your french MSN habits out of here :P
12:48	<errpast>	Bits, I've got 30 days. But I'm trying not to get too obsessive about it, as I'm out of work as of a week ago, and need to job search. Much as I'd rather hack
12:48	<g0th>	huh?
12:48	<joemac>	/dev/sd* /dev/sd* :no such file or directory
12:48	<g0th>	that's not a french MSN habits but anyway

12:49	<crashanddie>	joemac, might be ash sucks up the *
12:49	<errpast>	grrr, Yes, same here.
12:49	<Drezard>	how do i check what processes are running?
12:49	<daedra>	why can't mpd start at boot?!
12:49	<errpast>	grrr, I googled it, and found a workaroud. Let me see if I can find it again
12:49	<crashanddie>	Drezard, ps -A ?
12:49	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: Hello how did it go?
12:49	<MajSh>	can someone help me activate the tvout on my t42 under hardy?
12:49	<Drezard>	crashanddie, and how do i kill a process?
12:49	<errpast>	grrr, My symptom was that when I went to install, it failed. about 4 files couldn't be found
12:49	<grrr>	erpast, thankx very much
12:49	<Bits>	errpast: i've found that linux is just as fun without all the bells and whistles, and i gave up on the advanced graphics. no adv. graphics means less heat means less fan means less problems -- and it's perfectly serviceable
12:50	<Ceox>	brakkvatn: i pm'd you
12:50	<errpast>	grrr, this was true for the three choices for flash. adobe. and the other two
12:50	<MttJocy>	Drezard, kill -9 <processid>
12:50	<livingdaylight>	someone said something to me? (can't scroll back up far enough)
12:50	<grrr>	errpast, the nonfreeflash plugins dont works too.
12:50	<joneskoo>	how can I debootstrap ubuntu 8.04 with only using Debian Etch?
12:50	<errpast>	Bits, Smart move. It's easy to get fanatical about it. I know I do. But in the end, as long as I have net, Firefox, xchat, vim I'm pretty happy
12:51	<joemac>	hrgsfgh
12:51	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: Sorry I did not recieve any such message
12:51	<dns-en>	Hi Im looking for some help with these damn ATI drivers been trying for 2 days just get blck screen after enabling tried following All the tutorials on the forums already

12:51	<trentster>	openfiler
12:52	<oholiks>	joneskoo: try getting debootstrap package from ubuntu packges and extract the template file from it
12:52	<joneskoo>	oholiks: is the template file the only difference?
12:52	<joemac>	  /dev/hda1 not found
12:52	<crashanddie>	joemac, good, good
12:52	<joneskoo>	oholiks: in the man page it warns that debian stable's debootstrap might be too old for debian sid, presumably that applies for ubuntu too
12:52	<errpast>	grrr, that's the link I found yesterday. BUT....the link isn't working today. I didn't succeed getting Flash with 8.04, but I didn't try. I was just researching a few things that didn't work, and was going to try them all today
12:52	<joemac>	Good?
12:52	<oholiks>	joneskoo: used to be atleast
12:52	<crashanddie>	joemac, well at least it's consistent
12:52	<joemac>	lol
12:52	<samalex>	anyone familiar with netatalk?  I'm trying to copy data from OSX to Ubuntu Server 8.04, but Netatalk is passing the free space of the user's home directory and not the HD mounted within.
12:53	<oholiks>	joneskoo: pin unstable debootstrap and use that one?
12:53	<MttJocy>	Okay I'm lost, unless there is something else a hard drive can show up as, seams it is not detecting it.
12:53	<joneskoo>	oholiks: perhaps. I haven't did pinning so I'll just try the template first
12:53	<samalex>	... the /home partition only has 5 gigs of free space but I've mounted a 300 gig HD within my home directory to backup stuff to.  OSX shows only 5 gigs free so when I try to copy stuff into this 300 gig mounted drive, says not enough space
12:53	<crashanddie>	joemac, I think you should try to get a CD/DVD and try again, because your install seems pretty damaged
12:54	<grrr>	ok, man. merci quand mÃªme

12:55	<MttJocy>	That assumes he has bit torrent set up of course
12:55	<errpast>	Anyone have a Lenovo with sound problems on 8.04?
12:56	<huibuh>	:D
12:56	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it assumes his other computer works, and he cares about not downing the servers more
12:56	<Drezard>	whats mozilla 3 beta 5 installed as? like what package?
12:56	<thebigham>	how do i auto mount the windows partition on startup?
12:57	<joemac>	thank you for your time crashhanddie and mttJocy, I will see what I can do with a torrent downloaded cd:)
12:57	<Drezard>	whats mozilla 3 beta 5 installed as? like what package?
12:57	<crashanddie>	dreamnid, firefox or firefox-3.0
12:57	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Yeah, now if only their desktop upgrade tool would let you select torrent instead of HHTP
12:57	<MttJocy>	HTTP*
12:57	<MajSh>	thebigham: just add it to the /etc/fstab (and install ntfs-3g if it's needed)
12:57	<Drezard>	crashanddie, thanks
12:57	<Drezard>	crashanddie, neither worked :(
12:58	<crashanddie>	Drezard, what are you trying to achieve ?
12:58	<grrr>	errpest, thank you, nice day all
12:58	<Daisuke_Ido>	immortality!
12:58	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, we talked about that on #ubuntu-release-party 'bout that issue the day before yesterday
12:58	<Drezard>	crashanddie, dont worry found it :) thanks
12:58	<daedra>	has anyone in here got mpd running in hardy?
12:59	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Oh?
12:59	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, But they decided against it?
12:59	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, there are in fact a few problems with it
12:59	<g0th>	when I run make-kpkg binary-arch in linux-2.6.24/ I get at the end:
12:59	<bumcheekcity>	hi guys. quick question. can you use wubi to install the x64 version of ubuntu on x86 Vista? obviously, I have a 64-bit capable CPU
12:59	<g0th>	Makefile:526: /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.24/arch/xen/Makefile: No such file or directory
12:59	<g0th>	make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.24/arch/xen/Makefile'.  Stop.
12:59	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Such as?
[13:00	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, first of all, we would need to take a few choices, like do we make one big package with everything in it for the upgrade, or one .torrent per package ?
[13:00	<daedra>	paste!|goth
[13:00	<daedra>	oops
[13:00	<g0th>	hmm and I can't set the background anymore somehow
[13:00	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, both are good, because one is better for the server, but the other is better for maintainability
[13:00	<daedra>	!paste|g0th
[13:00	<ubotu>	g0th: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[13:00	<g0th>	how do I change the background?
[13:00	<blame>	how do you manage services on ubuntu?
[13:00	<MajSh>	please anyone... i really need to get the TV OUT working.. it's the last thing that sends me back to windows.. :(
[13:01	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, then of course, it would mean that the devs need to push yet another package, and pushing a release on bittorrent is way harder than just working behind the projectors and syncing HTTP/FTP mirrors
[13:01	<g0th>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64505/
[13:01	<g0th>	ubotu: that's the whole output
[13:01	<g0th>	daedra sorry
[13:02	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's cheaper, but it's harder, and we've seen it during the last couple days, even the tracker got downed by the amount of users
[13:02	<Ceo1>	hey
[13:03	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, imagine what it would be if everyone did the same ? Also, bittorrent doesn't allow you to use local mirrors, so those who don't care would be using one download for each computer, instead of setting up a local mirror and downloading it once
[13:03	<Ceo1>	brakkvatn
[13:03	<Ceo1>	r u there?
[13:03	<g0th>	how do I change my background image?
[13:03	<joomla_user>	g0th, what are you building ?
[13:03	<m0ns00n>	Anyone knows why eclipse can't connect to the net in hardy?
[13:03	<g0th>	linux-2.6.24
[13:03	<joomla_user>	g0th, rightclick on desktop
[13:03	<g0th>	I don't know why xen is mentioned
[13:03	<m0ns00n>	Not installed from packages..
[13:03	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, One .torrent per package probably would not really be the best idea to be fair, torrent tends to not work as efficiently with many small files, however if you put it in one big torrent it would work better, and it is still possible to selectively download the .debs inside it (Azureus has the option I think all Bit Torrent clients do)
[13:03	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's a nice idea, but it's pretty much flawed from the start, and we'd need to hack it big time before we could do something with it
[13:04	<lamothe>	beardos: And there you are!
[13:04	<g0th>	joomla_user: hmm I don't get anything if I right click
[13:04	<g0th>	I don't have nautlius installed
[13:04	<g0th>	nautilus
[13:04	<Fritzel>	does anyone know if iTunes will succesfully sync with an ipod in a VM?
[13:04	<gavin__>	Hi, I have just upgraded to 8.04 and for some reason Ubuntu will no longer recognize my sound card (Intel 82801H - ICH8 Family (rev 02)), can anyone help
[13:04	<g0th>	if I install nautilus my system gets so slow so since I never use it I removed it
[13:04	<joomla_user>	g0th, what window manager do you use
[13:04	<zyx386>	why the forefox is standard work offline under Hardy?
[13:04	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, yeah, but "selectively downloading the .debs" is pretty much counter productive, because you don't have it, and you don't share with others
[13:04	<g0th>	compiz
[13:04	<silentlamb>	errpast am bk
[13:05	<g0th>	gnome/compiz
[13:05	<joeamined>	hi
[13:06	<Yapsey>	good day :>
[13:06	<g0th>	joomla_user: I also installed drapes
[13:06	<joeamined>	how can i install ubuntu from the live cd without launching gnome ?
[13:06	<silentlamb>	errpast so wat do u do wit ur linux box
[13:06	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I think there's something else that worries them, we've all seen how updates get distributed on WoW, or any other update manager that uses bittorrent
[13:06	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Talking about local mirrors, I wish that squid didn't decide not to cache .debs if it had cached them would save having to download them all again for the other machine :|
[13:06	<gfather>	guys anyone here has a vpn for god sake ?? ??
[13:06	<Yapsey>	joeamined: there's an alternate install CD
[13:06	<silentlamb>	want to learn perl and python very important in security
[13:06	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, like I said, it could be an awesome idea, but it really needs some work, I might write an essay about it or something ;)
[13:07	<joeamined>	yapsey: is it possible from the live cd ?
[13:07	<Yapsey>	don't know. maybe the second option in the booting menu?
[13:07	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I have a local mirror on my home network, I've uploaded more than 80Gig on release day ;)
[13:07	<cd-r>	gavin__ : check here http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main
[13:07	<Oetzi>	hi there
[13:07	<jdolan>	hi, if i don't have my CD handy, is there a way to force synaptic to download packages like g++?
[13:07	<Oetzi>	i just upgraded to hardy and facing some problems now
[13:08	<Oetzi>	first thing
[13:08	<Yapsey>	jdolan: just using a network source?
[13:08	<gavin__>	the strange thing is that it works perfectly on 8.10
[13:08	<Oetzi>	ssh-agent seems not to work
[13:08	<jdolan>	Yapsey, sure, how do i tell it to do that?
[13:08	<jdolan>	just remove the CD from my sources list?
[13:08	<b33r_>	does anyone know where's iced tea java cache directory and how to change it?
[13:08	<silentlamb>	yeah how can install ubuntu on and empty system with a bad crcrive
[13:08	<Oetzi>	always get an error
[13:08	<MttJocy>	(Unless there is some way to force it to cache them, but bit late now, already done the download on the one machine anyway, although if there was a way to force it would save wasted downloads when both computers have to download for the most part the same updates even with normal updates)
[13:08	<Yapsey>	jdolan: place a # in front of your CD is the easiest way I guess :)
[13:08	<Oetzi>	Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
[13:08	<silentlamb>	is there any solution to that problem
[13:08	<zyx386>	can every one tell me that?
[13:08	<silentlamb>	seen the pendrive
[13:09	<jdolan>	Yapsey, hah, why didn't i think of that?  (just disabling the source), hehe :)
[13:09	<Yapsey>	you're welcome :>
[13:09	<silentlamb>	but the all need a functional OS to work
[13:09	<joneskoo>	oholiks: hmh. I don't even see the script for 8.04 in ubuntu debootstrap. isn't it called hoary?
[13:09	<joneskoo>	no hardy
[13:09	<MttJocy>	Is that possible? to force squid to cache .debs instead of ignore them? (I assume the file names do change with each version of the package right)
[13:09	<zyx386>	why is FF Work offline standard?
[13:09	<g0th>	so how do I change my background without nautilus?
[13:09	<Yapsey>	zyx386: what's the problem?
[13:09	<silentlamb>	anybody?

[13:10	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, but you should be able to temporarily add .debs to the caching abiliy
[13:10	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, you will need to highly up the cache limit, though

[13:10	<alex_mayorg1>	any other location?
[13:11	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, I don't suppose there is some directive to do it just from the file extension and tell it to cache those no?
[13:11	<dns-en>	it will be easier to just junk these damn ati cards I think

[13:15	<daniel_hh>	Hello, yesterday I upgraded ubuntu 7.10 ->	8.04, but Firefox3 can't work with the old extension and ruined my profile so I can't go back to FF2. I removed the FF3 package and reinstalled FF2, but when I click on links on the desktop .. opera appears (which was installed, but didn't started as default). .. Setting the alternative for x-www-browser didn't worked, setting System>settings>prefered applications>browser to firefox didn't worked

[13:28	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: I doubleclick a link on the desktop or a link in thunderbird .. then starts opera. Did you mean that? In "Prefered applications" is now a userdefined setting (firefox -P daniel %s).
[13:28	<reiki>	simas__, not the correct channel for that question
[13:28	<nethakz>	simas__, you may want to try a programming channel.
[13:28	<crashanddie>	Drezard, that's probably because of the umask that isn't set
[13:28	<simas__>	what channel i shoud use?
[13:28	<silent>	timr92: did u see my message?

[13:29	<silent>	idyllic: sure, 1 sec, let me copy it into pastebin
[13:29	<crashanddie>	Drezard, that would be in the mount options, check /etc/fstab
[13:29	<lamothe>	daniel_hh: That's what I meant. Hmmm
[13:29	<icqnumber>	simas__, ask this in the c++ channel /join ##c++, the diff is that one ist one function returns reference of an integer

[13:33	<r3d3y3>	How do I install the kernel source ?
[13:33	<patrik>	Hi I'm experiencing some problems with evolution. I have a process called "evolution-data-server-2.22" which runs at 100% on one of my cores. Evolution seems to work as it should though.
[13:34	<silent>	idyllic: in preferences i have 1600x1200, refresh 61gz, rotation normal, but i bet this info is not really that helpful, its all it says :/
[13:34	<r3d3y3>	is it sudo apt-get install kernel-source-2.6.24 ... ?
[13:34	<justin420>	does anybody know if there are any upgrade issue from gutsy to hardy? I have a laptop with a broken cd/dvd drive; and it was VERY difficult to get gutsy installed....
[13:34	<idyllic>	silent: which graphic card? and monitor?
[13:34	<mluser-home>	Which kernel do I need to be running to use all 4G of ram, right now I'm only detecting 3G of the 4
[13:34	<mut80r>	justin420: might be best to wait for a few weeks, have had several reports of upgrades failing
[13:35	<g0th>	lamothe: anyway, thx for the information
[13:35	<g0th>	another question
[13:35	<reiki>	mluser-home, assuming your motherboard supports it... you probably want a 64-bit version of Ubuntu... not 32-bit
[13:35	<mut80r>	mluser-home: you need a 64-bit machine and OS
[13:35	<Yapser>	running a 64-bit distro instead of 32 mluser-home? (just slap me enormously if this is a Windows-only prob :>)
[13:35	<g0th>	I tried to install my own custom kernel using make-kpkg
[13:35	<justin420>	mut80r: thanks allot! appreciate it.... saved me allot of headache. :)
[13:35	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: sure.. but these settings doesn't seem to help :(
[13:35	<mluser-home>	doesnt the kernel in pae mode detect 4G of ram even in 32 bit mode?
[13:35	<g0th>	the usual installation works fine (ie. doing make, make modules, etc in linux-2.6.24) but when I run make-kpkg it always fails, etg with the following message:
[13:35	<g0th>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64506/
[13:35	<moorkook>	hello everybody
[13:36	<mut80r>	mluser-home: it may do, but it won't be able to address it all on a 32-bit machine/OS
[13:36	<silent>	idyllic: also, my monitor is a "Asus LS201 20" LCD Monitor" and my graphics card is a "BFG GeForce 7800 GT" (nvidia core)
[13:36	<sharperguy>	Is there any way to set java to output through pulseaudio so it doesnt dominate the sound card?/
[13:36	<Arand>	Yea, is there any way to install ubuntu without a working optical drive? boot off usb stick?
[13:36	<jarle>	How do I make a /etc/init.d/ script run as a normal user, and not as root?
[13:36	<mluser-home>	Are there any known software incompatibilities with the 64bit version of ubuntu right now?
[13:36	<mut80r>	Arand: google     ubuntu live pen drive
[13:37	<askan1>	Is there w way to prnit only selected text in firefox?
[13:37	<g0th>	and another question: compiz shows the window decoration only nicely for actively selected windows, the other window decoration aren't visible or look messed up
[13:37	<Arand>	mut80r cheers
[13:37	<dirtyrice>	jarle: why would you want to do that
[13:37	<mut80r>	mluser-home: there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of almost all of the packages
=== Yapser is now known as z0g
[13:37	<mluser-home>	mut80r: Thanks
[13:37	<cherva>	please help when I apt-get glipper the install completes normally and after that there is no glipper installed
[13:37	<lamothe>	daniel_hh: If you haven't already, can I recommend logging out/in.  Maybe gconf is stuck.
[13:37	<mut80r>	mluser-home: as far as I know.
[13:37	<GoodJob>	my system has the keyboard layout set to some other than the USA... in the system the behaviour is correct, but in the Login Window the keyboard layout is messed up (the USA layout is loaded)... how can i make my system's keyboard layout to be the same for the Login Window?
[13:37	<chazco>	Hi... ive just installed 8.04 onto my u200 laptop. It works okay except its slow to start. The stage where the "ubuntu" splash progress bar moves from side to side takes ages. Had no issues with Gusty. Any ideas?
[13:37	<idyllic>	silent: lol, okay. Can you change your xorg.conf. Driver from vesa to nvidia?
[13:37	<GoodJob>	i have hardy

[13:38	<Wibble->	I've got a real problem with Hardy - my sound card just stopped working! It was working this morning and now doesn't.  No additional software was installed AFAIK.  Pulse audo appears to be running and hasn't put anything in syslog.
[13:38	<idyllic>	silent: back up your xorg.conf first in case there is problem later
[13:38	<mut80r>	chazco: kernel improvements I think. happens to me too. then it goes to the normal loading bar
[13:38	<IntangibleLiquid>	how do I define Fn F9 to be the touchpad enabler/disabler?
[13:38	<idyllic>	silent: you got nvidia-glx-new driver installed i suppose?
[13:38	<adac>	i deleteted the old sources.list file and added the new for the upgrade to hardy sith only hardy sources...but still when I call apt-get update it shows me that it fetches gutsy repositories. What is the problem here?
[13:38	<chazco>	mut80r - It doesnt do it on my desktop though... seems odd to have a slower bootup on a more powerful machine
[13:38	<joeamined>	hi
[13:39	<joeamined>	is it possible to install ubuntu desktop edition without launching gnome ?
[13:39	<rsk>	joeamined: use the alternative iso
[13:39	<g0th>	hmpf, not much help here :(
[13:39	<r3d3y3>	What does this error mean ... checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[13:39	<joeamined>	rsk: there's no way to do it with the desktop iso ?
[13:39	<rsk>	nope
[13:39	<mut80r>	chazco: I don't exactly know what the sideways scrolling bar is there for. disabling the splash screen, all I see is a 10-second or so pause before it gets going.
[13:40	<silent>	idyllic: i dont think so
[13:40	<theone_>	joeamined, do you mean booting straight to a command line?
[13:40	<joeamined>	theone: i mean installing ubuntu with command line
[13:40	<silent>	idyllic: just installed this ubuntu and put xchat on it, nothing else
[13:40	<chazco>	mut80r - Unsure what its for here also... on mine if i boot in recovery mode I see it pause over ACPI/SATA initalisation...
[13:40	<joeamined>	because i don't have enough RAM (only 256), so i can't install with live cd booted
[13:41	<idyllic>	silent: System - Administration - Hardware Driver =D enable the restrictive driver
[13:41	<dirtyrice>	then you must use alternate cd like the guy above said
[13:41	<mut80r>	chazco: are you using a SATA drive ?
[13:41	<joeamined>	ok thanks
[13:41	<chazco>	mut80r - Yep... but my desktop is also which doesnt have this issue
[13:41	<dirtyrice>	i had to use it when installing on a 550
[13:41	<theone_>	joeamined, you should just pick the install without booitng to the live cd option
[13:41	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: I allread restarted X and the computer
[13:41	<mut80r>	chazco: would be best not to mess with anything for now then until someone can tell us what it's there for. ;)

[14:01	<schnootop>	hello, since i upgraded to heron, whenever i try to connect to windows share i get - Can't display location "smb://192.168.10.6/"
[14:01	<spiniker>	it says the source is encrypted  im trying to play without libdvds something
[14:01	<schnootop>	anyone know why this might be ?
[14:02	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: thanks for your time anyway. I just found a solution: I renamed /usr/bin/opera ->	/usr/bin/opera9 .. and now it opens firefox *wonder*
[14:02	<QuadF>	guess i'll install 7.10
[14:02	<QuadF>	:(
[14:02	<spiniker>	is there a codec that i still need to download?
[14:02	<theone_>	spiniker, you need to install the libdvdcss file. you can find out more at
[14:02	<MttJocy>	pawan, Go to System ->	Administration ->	Hardware Drivers and make sure that is set to use the restricted driver not the open source one see if that helps (if it is not set select the restricted driver and reboot your computer see if that fixes it)
[14:03	<spiniker>	where?

[14:05	<kaann>	is there anybody speak turkish
[14:05	<Dante123>	hi all, sometimes my pc running 7.10 hangs on boot.  I have disabled quiet boot and have written down where in the boot process it is when it hangs.  Generally, turning the machine off and back on fixes the problem.  I have had people suggest the psu but it is a 450w and personally I think it is working fine.  Someone suggested I write down the exact points at which it hangs.
[14:05	<b33r_>	does anyone know where's iced tea java cache directory and how to change its location?
[14:06	<pawan>	alaways when i load the machine it displays the message running in low graphics mode
[14:06	<pawan>	continue or what
[14:06	<QuadF>	ok .. dumb question..
[14:06	<Dante123>	Here are a couple of places:  "starting system message bus dbus"---->	hangs

[14:06	<pawan>	in gutsy my card was working fine

[14:07	<nwillett>	sorry guys quick question - is pulse audio volume control enabled by default with 8.04 install?
[14:07	<lamothe>	daniel_hh: Ha, go figure.
[14:07	<graingert>	nwillet: no
[14:07	<graingert>	nwillett: no

[14:08	<nwillett>	is there an easy way to set it up?
[14:08	<graingert>	Dante123: have you tried the irqpoll bootflag
[14:08	<mut80r>	nwillet: double click the volume control, click file ->	change device
[14:08	<MttJocy>	pawan, Okay, try uninstalling the proprietary driver, restart, see if that works, then try reinstalling the proprietary one again if you want to, perhaps in the upgrade your install of that got messed up or something.
[14:08	<Dante123>	 graingert yes I have disabled spash, and these are the results I see when it hangs.  Most of the time it boots fine...but from time to time these errors
[14:08	<g0th>	LinuxGuy1234: hmm does make-kpkg work at all then?
[14:09	<Dante123>	 graingert what is the irqpoll bootflag and how do I use it?
[14:09	<pawan>	how to uninstall

[14:10	<g0th>	hmm anyway, can someone in here help me with make-kpkg?
[14:10	<kaminix>	Is there any way to set a process not to use RAM/Swap at all and link it so some sort of swapfile?
[14:10	<LinuxGuy1234>	g0th: You can build the source by doing 'cp /boot/config-2.6.24.3* .config; make slientoldconfig; make'
[14:10	<graingert>	Dante123: hit "e" to edit add "irqpoll" where splash used to be

[14:10	<Dante123>	okay will try graingert...what should I see if there is a problem or what should I look for?
[14:10	<SuperLag>	Hardy is nice. I've got to say.
[14:11	<g0th>	why make silentoldconfig?
[14:11	<mut80r>	SuperLag: :)
[14:11	<Abd>	teamcobra sucessfully compiled kernel 2.6.25 and bcm42xx is working perfectly
[14:11	<danbhfive>	kaminix: thats an interesting question, what are you trying to do? (I don't know, btw)
[14:11	<graingert>	if there is a problem: no boot, if not boots fine
[14:11	<MttJocy>	lintel, Which video output driver are you using in your media player?

[14:11	<lintel>	MttJocy, both xine and gstream
[14:12	<Crofa>	how to connect to another channel??
[14:12	<nwillett>	ok so i just switched to pulse audio mixer in the volume control but it isn't giving me the option to control the volume of individual streams...
[14:12	<mut80r>	QuadF: drag it
[14:12	<graingert>	dang
[14:12	<Crofa>	 /J ?
[14:12	<SuperLag>	Abd: on Hardy? running with a 2.6.25 kernel?
[14:12	<nikonlappy>	exit
[14:12	<QuadF>	it wont let me drag it
[14:12	<graingert>	nwillet you need to download the gui
[14:12	<Abd>	SuperLag Yes
[14:12	<MttJocy>	lintel, Yes but which video output driver though?
[14:12	<Crofa>	how to connect to another channel?
[14:12	<graingert>	padevchooser
[14:12	<kaminix>	danbhfive: I'm going to fsck my drive, been here done that and know it will take up LOADS of memory (enough to make my computer freeze)
[14:12	<mut80r>	QuadF: drag from a blank space on the bar. not from a menu
[14:12	<nwillett>	graingert you wouldn't happen to know what name the gui goes under?
[14:12	<SuperLag>	Abd: I wonder what, if anything, that broke compatibility with.
[14:13	<larry_>	anyone know a link to install wine to install diablo2 on 8.04
[14:13	<graingert>	nwillett: run "padevchooser" apt will tell you what to install

[14:13	<Abd>	SuperLag Yes I did it
[14:13	<MttJocy>	lintel, Okay, open up VLC or is it open already?
[14:13	<larry_>	ok
[14:13	<Crofa>	what is the name of the official C++ channel for germans?
[14:14	<Croofaaa>	.
[14:14	<lintel>	MttJocy open now
[14:14	<graingert>	larry_ http://www.playonlinux.com/en/
[14:14	<SuperLag>	Abd: is there a howto that says how to get all of the included Ubuntu patches bundled in? or did you just do a vanilla kernel?
[14:14	<Abd>	so if anyone has trouble with bcm 43xx compiling the 2.6.25 is a good option
[14:14	<graingert>	larry_: http://www.playonlinux.com/en/script-16.html

[14:16	<bobbob1016>	Is there a fade setting anywhere other than compiz?  I disabled the fade effect in compiz, but when I minimize a window, it still fades.  Any ideas?
[14:16	<Abd>	SuperLag I went to http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ and donwloaded the 2.6.25 compiled it with help from this site http://howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
[14:16	<mut80r>	bobbob1016: appearance, visual effects
[14:16	<daedra>	how do you use upstart to rearrange the order in which daemons are started?
[14:17	<MttJocy>	lintel, Then once in there, tick the advanced options, then in the list on the side open up the video part and click on Output modules.
[14:17	<chumii>	hi everyone, does anyone know a tool like "mozbackup" to save bookmarks, passwords etc or the complete firefox profile?

[14:18	<Nomikos_>	pinging my remote ubuntu box - 49 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 93% packet loss. what should I look at first?
[14:18	<bobbob1016>	mut80r, I know where that is, there isn't any choice for "fade" it just shows me settings for compiz, I want to disable the fade effect.  I already disabled it everywhere in ccsm, which is what appearance->visual effects brings me to
[14:18	<stoneDJay>	what should I do to fix it?
[14:18	<Nomikos_>	usually a pretty good cable connection, 15 mbit down, 1.5 mbit up
[14:19	<Satil>	If I set ssh allow rules before entering a default deny - will the ssh allow still be used even though the default deny was added later?
[14:19	<Makgyver>	ubuntu live CD will not install on powermac
[14:19	<mut80r>	bobbob1016: If in ccsm, Effects ->	Fading Windows is disabled, then it shouldn't be fading. must be another thing doing it. like a theme / alternate window decorator.
[14:19	<Makgyver>	I have searched google for an answer but nothing is coming back
[14:19	<MttJocy>	lintel, In that dialog which output module is selected in the box that says "Video output module"?
[14:20	<lintel>	MttJocy ok; what do we look for?
[14:20	<jagggy>	what is the default Java Development Kit 1.5 path ?
[14:20	<Fritzel>	are there any RTS's that run on ubuntu and have good controls, good controls being the most important factor
[14:20	<kaminix>	How would I use dd to create a 4 GB file?
[14:20	<LoCusF>	damn nvidia should be working, the kernel module is working ok
[14:20	<Abd>	SuperLag so I'm quite happy got my wireless back working
[14:20	<bobbob1016>	mut80r, Sorry, brain-fart I guess.  I thought it was only minimize effect, not another plugin as well...  Thanks
[14:21	<danbhfive>	Fritzel: you could try glob2
[14:21	<mut80r>	bobbob1016: no problem :P
[14:21	<MttJocy>	lintel, Did you go to the bit I said, under video (click the arrow to expand that item of the tree) you should see a bit that says output modules right?
[14:21	<Fritzel>	not yet in fact I never heard of it
[14:21	<lintel>	MttJocy video output is set to "default"
[14:21	<sharperguy>	Is there any way to set the java plugin to output through pulseaudio so it doesn't dominate the sound card?
[14:21	<Makgyver>	gentoo has installed on the box, but I would rather Ubuntu, any takers as to how I can get the installer to work?
[14:21	<Fritzel>	danbhfive, I'll give it a shot, thanks for the suggestion
[14:22	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path ?
[14:22	<MttJocy>	lintel, Right, just to test something try changing that to X11 (it is probably using XVideo as the default)
[14:22	<danbhfive>	Fritzel: np, I hopes thats the correct name : )
[14:22	<Musashiden>	Hello everyone. I have a question and I hope someone can answer it. Why do flash videos lag so much on ubuntu+firefox? / how can I fix this?

[14:22	<stoneDJay>	Hi... my usplash shows me for a while and goes to a blinking cursor ... after this time, GDM startup..  what should I do to fix it?
[14:22	<reiki>	Hardy install completed... took 30 minutes from first boot of CD to final boot and then install of xchat. :)  auto-detected and installed nvidia-glx-new and all appears to be working
[14:22	<Oetzi>	are there any howtos for using seahorse instead of ssh-agent under fluxbox?
[14:22	<danbhfive>	Fritzel: ya, I just checked too
[14:22	<mut80r>	reiki: nice.
[14:23	<Musashiden>	anybody?
[14:23	<Satil>	kaminix: something like `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=4000000 of=~/4gb`
[14:23	<bartmon>	stoneDJay: I think that's normal. It will be fixed when the kernel integrates video modesetting
[14:23	<duncan>	kaminix : dd if=/dev/zero of=myharddisk.img bs=1024 count=0 seek=$[1024*1024*4]
[14:23	<reiki>	mut80r, haven't installed World of Warcraft yet... that will be the show stopper for me if that don't work :)
[14:23	<lintel>	MttJocy: ok: set to "X11 video output" -- but VLC is NOT crashing only Kaffeine which 1 use for DVB-T and Movie Player. will this affect them as well?
[14:23	<Musashiden>	How can I make firefox use another flash plugin?
[14:23	<stoneDJay>	bartmon: Its not normal... I had a usplash working great a few days before...
[14:24	<magnetron>	Musashiden: which one are you thinking about switching to?

[14:24	<Arand>	I've got this script: http://mibbit.com/pb/lUl2ef, how do I make it run at shutdown and reboot? Is "sudo update-rc.d this_script start 90 0 6" (after putting "this_script" in init.d) the right way to go??
[14:24	<reiki>	ReactOS?
[14:24	<Musashiden>	magnetron: I don't know. some other one. the adobe one is lagging too much right now.
[14:24	<[yzf600]>	I upgraded to 8.04 last night, and now my RAID0 is broken
[14:24	<mut80r>	reiki: www.reactos.org

[14:24	<gullstad>	Hello. I'm trying to seed ubunty hardy from my server, and I installed torrentflux-b4rt, but it dosnt seem like it seeds very well. What is "superseeder", and is there any known problems whit torrentflux not uploading full capasity?
[14:24	<ubuntung-pinoy>	say that carlito is enjoying his session when his sister carlita asks to open her own session with her own account.. when carlita logs out, the screen goes white and the system becomes unresponsive. force shutdown (ie long press power button) becomes necessary.. what is carlito to do?
[14:24	<[yzf600]>	anyone have any pointers on where to look to fix it?
[14:25	<Musashiden>	magnetron: any recommendations?

[14:25	<Darklingduck>	I am new to Ubuntu and am having problems trying to get my wireless nic setup.  My laptop keeps locking up all the time when the nic is plugged in but not when it is removed.
[14:25	<Arand>	correction: http://mibbit.com/pb/QXF7ty
[14:25	<LadyNikon>	gullstad: you might have better luck going to a torrentflux channel
[14:25	<schnootop>	in hardy do you need xorg-xserver-fglrx anymore ?
[14:25	<[yzf600]>	I tried to search the upgrade forum, but the reCAPTCHA is broken
[14:25	<magnetron>	Musashiden: there is another one around. but it's not done yet. the reason your flash videos are slow is that Adobe made a crappy flash player
[14:25	<bartmon>	ubuntung-pinoy: It hink you should disable desktop effects (compiz)
[14:25	<LadyNikon>	magnetron: heh
[14:25	<lintel>	MttJocy: VLC is running fine. But Kaffeine crashes especially after another window covered it or when switching to another desktop.
[14:25	<Yaps>	meep
[14:26	<Musashiden>	magnetron: when i first opened a flash site, firefox gave me a choice of 3 flash players to use. I chose adobe since I thought it would be better.
[14:26	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path ?
[14:26	<ubuntung-pinoy>	bartmon: care to shed some light as to the sitch's cause?
[14:26	<nads>	Hi guys - I have two HDDs, first is a SATA driver which has Windows on it, and the second is an IDE drive. I installled Ubuntu 8.04 on the IDE one, but I'm unable to boot into it... it always loads Windows first. Can anyone please guide me to the right direction? Thanks
[14:26	<duncan>	kaminix :no because you see theare is a block also 1024, so actualy 1024^3=GB :)
[14:26	<nwillett>	it seems like hardy has changed the way you make vlc the default dvd player. Used to do change that through removable drives and media settings. Where do you go now?
[14:26	<Slappy>	makgyver i did a google search for initramfs error and there was a forum that mentioned what someone tried running HH with the pci=nomsi command
[14:26	<MttJocy>	lintel, Okay, first put VLC's output driver back to default then
[14:26	<pawan>	nvidia drivers using envy
[14:27	<mut80r>	nads:  install grub on hd0
[14:27	<Musashiden>	nads: Did you configure your bios to read the IDE first?
[14:27	<magnetron>	Musashiden: the other one is called gnash. i don't think you'll be happy with it, sadly. when my youtube videos are slow, i download them manually and watch them locally.
[14:27	<ubuntung-pinoy>	nads: are u sure that boot priority in the BIOS is right?
=== ubuntu is now known as djanos
[14:27	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[14:27	<kaminix>	duncan: Ah, I see. Thanks. :)
[14:27	<Yaps>	oh
[14:27	<MttJocy>	lintel, Sorry about that, bit of wasted work but I misunderstood the problem.
[14:27	<nads>	ubuntung-pinoy, i'll have another look... :) brb thanks
[14:27	<bartmon>	ubuntung-pinoy: Don't know much about it... But when i switched between two X sessions with both compiz enhanced, the new X session would freeze
[14:27	<duncan>	kaminix: welcome :)
[14:27	<Musashiden>	magnetron: so I'm guessing there is no fix as of yet for linux and flash video lags?
[14:28	<g0th>	I asked 5 questions and didn't get anyhelp for even one of them :(
[14:28	<Arand>	I've got this script: http://mibbit.com/pb/QXF7ty, how do I make it run at shutdown and reboot? Is "sudo update-rc.d this_script start 90 0 6" (after putting "this_script" in init.d) the right way to go??
[14:28	<pawan>	my nvidia graphics card is not working with hardy

[14:28	<pawan>	how

[14:29	<ciro>	hi all
[14:29	<bartmon>	ubuntung-pinoy: i think so... I didn't try that because one user prefers to be logged in all the time
[14:29	<ciro>	how can i install awn and its applets?

[14:30	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about release notes - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[14:30	<lintel>	MttJocy: Movie Player, which seems to crash when resizing and Kaffeine for DVB-T, coz Gnome has no match ;) The latter crashes when switching desktops even when playing has stopped
[14:30	<ubuntung-pinoy>	bartmon: carlito says byebye to compiz.. thanks!
[14:30	<LoCusF>	pawan: we have the same problem lol
[14:30	<cd-r>	hi I just installed MS reader via wine. It starts up but than crashes. anybody know any solutions?
[14:30	<MttJocy>	pawalls[work], Did you try what I suggested? ie uninstall the proprietary reboot your computer, see if it then works?
[14:30	<bebraw>	ciro, on hardy try "sudo apt-get install awn-manager"
[14:30	<bartmon>	ubuntung-pinoy: np

[14:31	<johnmike>	Hi there! Anyone know of a good site to do Port Forwarding, learn all about it, set it up with Ubuntu, etc?
[14:31	<grzyb>	google.com
[14:31	<mut80r>	johnmike: www.portforward.com
=== ponto-gov is now known as chicobento
[14:32	<Nomikos_>	johnmike: try wikipedia? usually works for general stuff
[14:32	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: doesnt seem to work
[14:32	<johnmike>	I have been trying for days now and I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong!
[14:32	<MttJocy>	lintel, Could you perhaps try mplayer see if that works for you?
[14:32	<Slappy>	johnmike www.portforward.com
[14:32	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: can i identify what its process name is somehow?
[14:32	<mut80r>	Slappy: beat ya :P
[14:32	<Lieutenant>	Question: i have ubuntu 6.04 installed, downloaded the new release of kubuntu 8.** and when i insert the CD in to the PC and reboot, the only menu option that works is "Boot to First Hard Drive"
[14:32	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I intalled Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (for my ATI radeon sapphire x1550 video card, I think). I installed those drivers and a blinking icon told me to reboot my pc. After that I can't use ubuntu anymore, I always get a black screen. I wonder what I have to do
[14:32	<Slappy>	awww
[14:32	<[yzf600]>	I figured out my RAID issue
[14:32	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: yep.. System >	admin >	services
[14:32	<lintel>	MttJocy: IMHO Hardy has a serious problem!
[14:32	<[yzf600]>	had to "sudo mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1"
[14:33	<johnmike>	mut80r: I've tried portforward.com and for whatever reason, it won't work when I follow all of my routers instructions
[14:33	<[yzf600]>	then I could mount the raid
[14:33	<tyler>	Lieutenant: What happens when you choose the other options?
[14:33	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: or System >	Admin >	System Monitor...
[14:33	<duncan>	Lieutenant: burn again the image, i had also this problem, i don't no why :(
[14:33	<Lieutenant>	tyler: Nothing at all
[14:33	<MttJocy>	Johnmike, The ubuntu box is the main router in your network then?
[14:33	<Lieutenant>	duncan: this is the third burn, from 2 comuters
[14:33	<LoCusF>	in what service does the "VIA Padlock" belong to?
[14:34	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: in sysmon i can see process name but its not the same as window name
[14:34	<Nomikos_>	what should I check first if remote Ubuntu box responds to < 10% of pings?
[14:34	<johnmike>	MttJocy: No, I have a d-link 624m wireless router
[14:34	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Check the md5sum of you .iso image; burn it agian and have your burning app verify it.
[14:34	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: what app are u trying to quit?
[14:34	<schnootop>	anyone know if in hardy we still need xorg-xserver-fglrx or do they have there own ?
[14:35	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: software sources, it is stuck on pinging the best server, i used close but its been closing for 10 min
[14:35	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: can you login to the remote box?
[14:35	<Lieutenant>	tyler: I did all that already, was wondering if thre is a known problem with kubuntu 8 and compaq computers
[14:35	<duncan>	Lieutenant: then maybe the download was wrong, i think, before you burn somethink to cd, you try it, for example, you can try this boot image in virtualbox
[14:35	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, I thought you meant set up port forwarding on your ubuntu computer (as you did ask in the ubuntu channel)
[14:35	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: no :-/ connection too slow for that, it halts at "debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent"
[14:35	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: hav u tried the services manager/monitor?
[14:35	<tyler>	Lieutenant: check the md5sum of the iso.
[14:36	<johnmike>	MttJocy: ha ha, sorry! I asked here because maybe there's an Ubuntu specific site addressing it
[14:36	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: even getting there takes about a minute, usually it logs in within a second
[14:36	<akt>	Hi. This must be a FAQ but I'm worndering what's the advantage/disadvantage of using ubuntu server instead of Debian?
[14:36	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: sorry?
[14:36	<virus92ita>	anyone can help me with video card drivers?
[14:36	<mut80r>	johnmike: some routers won't activate port forwarding until you disable DHCP. annoying, I know.
[14:37	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: heh, so general connection issues, not specifically with ping... what actual type of connection to the internet does it have?
[14:37	<Lieutenant>	tyler: it passed the md5sum on my xp box
[14:37	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable, about 15 mbit down, 1.5 mbit up. usually no problems at all
[14:37	<akt>	Both will provide latest apps and anyway both the same Linux kernel. using the same aptitude
[14:37	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: never mind the previous
[14:37	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: are there are boxen on the same connection you can check?
[14:37	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: straight to modem, no router (anymore). possible that it was hacked somehow?
[14:37	<akt>	what's the difference?
[14:38	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: nope
[14:38	<akt>	As a server.
[14:38	<Lieutenant>	tyler: could the system be the problem? 1.2GHz celeron, 256MB Ram, 120Gig HDD
[14:38	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ooooh....never tried that disabling that!
[14:38	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: hmm well it's a bit difficult to say that's it definitively a problem with ubuntu
[14:38	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I can go overthere which I will do even though it's a bit of a hassle.. what should I check for first, behind the thing?
[14:38	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: what's the Process Name u get ?
[14:38	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[14:39	<mut80r>	johnmike: unless you know how to set a static IP and have the DNS addresses, DON'T disable DHCP.
[14:39	<Jarwo>	sweety_girl
[14:39	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: if you can go over there and access the box, then you can do a lot of general connection tests
[14:39	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Yes, you should have ~350MB of Ram to do the ive cd.
[14:39	<Fritzel>	danbhfive, this is an interesting rts, from the first few minutes in the tutorial it seems like there isnt' much micro-management to worry about
[14:39	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: i dont know process name, thats the thing...
[14:39	<Lieutenant>	tyler: i just wanted to install it
[14:39	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[14:40	<Lieutenant>	tyler: the disk does work on my laptop, same specs, just a dell
[14:40	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yeah, bit afraid they'll come out the same.. :-/ anything I should look at after concluding it's not connecting?
[14:40	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ha ha, no. I would look it all up first. How would I learn how to setup static IPs, figure out DNSs, and all that on Ubuntu?
[14:40	<tyler>	Lieutenant: You should download the text-based alternate cd from the ubuntu site.
[14:40	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: me neither.. but no Process Name in the SysMon that resembles the one u're looking for?
[14:40	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, well if you wait here a few minutes I'll be happy to talk to you see if I can come up with any ideas to help y ideas to help you but I just need to restart this computer first so will be gone a few minutes ok?
[14:40	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: rebooted it only yesterday
[14:40	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  PLEASE?
[14:40	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: nope...
[14:40	<johnmike>	MttJocy: Sure! Thanks!
[14:40	<ciro>	bebraw, i just installed awn and awn manager but there are no applets in the program
[14:40	<mut80r>	johnmike: are you using network-manager? (the network icon in the top right corner)
[14:41	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: well it seems unstable rather than "not connecting"... i'd start up a packet sniffer on it and check what's going on...
[14:41	<MttJocy>	Okay, see you in a few minutes.
[14:41	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  PLEASE?
[14:41	<bebraw>	ciro, i suppose you have to get the plugins elsewhere
[14:41	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah
[14:41	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: yeah if it's ppp, check those logs
[14:41	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: good idea, I'll try that
[14:41	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: ppp?
[14:41	<tyler>	Lieutenant: The RAM requirement are just what they say on the Ubuntu web site, and could very welll be the reason of your problem. i've gotten the live cd to run on a box with 128MB!!
[14:41	<magnetron>	ciro: you have to drag something to the icon area, IIRC
[14:41	<mut80r>	johnmike: right click nm-applet, click connection information. copy down IP address, default route, subnet mask, and DNS addresses.
[14:41	<x0x>	ok how to install eBox?
[14:41	<bebraw>	has someone gotten blender work ok on hardy? it flickers between the app and bg here (using desktop fx)
[14:41	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: i remember having the same prob but with Update Manager itself.. forgot what i did with it.. i'll try to trace back but i won't count on it.. sorry..
[14:42	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: point-to-point... thought it might be the way it's going through the modem
[14:42	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I just got Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver). I installed those drivers and a blinking icon told me to reboot my pc. Now I can't use ubuntu anymore, I always get a black screen before log on screen. Can someone help me?
[14:42	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable modem, broadband
[14:42	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: is the cable modem itself a network device or is it bridged?
[14:43	<khafra>	The initramfs shell includes utilities like ls, egrep, etc--but not vi or anything
[14:43	<josh04_>	:exit
[14:43	<khafra>	How do I edit files?
[14:43	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: not sure what you mean - it's the modem that came with my broadband connection. used to have a router behind it to make a LAN, but atm ubuntu box is connected to it
[14:43	<LainIwakura>	Hello, I installed an xfonts .deb package. It shows up in xfontsel but I cannot set it in any application or X. What do I need to do so that I can actually use this font? Thanks for any help. I greatly appreciate it!
[14:43	<tj__>	I just installed 8.04 and i cannot get a screen resolution above 640x480
[14:43	<Lieutenant>	tyler: are they still mailing out the Distro CDs?
[14:43	<Stroganoff>	!bash | khafra
[14:43	<ubotu>	khafra: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications ->	Accessories ->	Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu ->	System ->	Konsole (KDE).  Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
[14:43	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: only, and the modem cable goes well, into the wall
[14:43	<b33r_>	does anyone know where's iced tea java cache directory and how to change its location?
[14:43	<tj__>	i have the restricted drivers installed for my nvidia
[14:43	<khafra>	Stroganoff: Nono, the initramfs shell
[14:44	<khafra>	Like, when you've had an error on boot
[14:44	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: what i meant was, does the modem have its own ip? i'm guessing not
[14:44	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Yes, they are afaik, thought I don't know how long it takes before they arrive.
[14:44	<ubuntung-pinoy>	quick question.. is a hard drive formatted by & installed w/ ubuntu supposed to be unrecognizable in XP?
[14:44	<x0x>	 how to install eBox?
[14:44	<jim_beam>	i have a microsoft office keyboard that microsoft vista stopped supporting.  I bet linux can help me support the keyboard scroll wheel and xopy paste buttons.  can anyone tell me how to do this
[14:44	<psych>	hi
[14:44	<Lieutenant>	two - three weeks
[14:44	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: ah, no, don't think so.
[14:44	<khafra>	It has a very limited set of commands, and as far as I could tell the didn't include a text editor, and sed didn't work properly
[14:44	<psych>	dpkg is freezing while starting samba daemons
[14:44	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: if it's using the default filesystem (EXT3) yes
[14:44	<johnmike>	mut80r: lol, I hate it when the answers are so easy ;) Ok! Got it!
[14:44	<psych>	how can i abort it
[14:44	<psych>	so i can install any other programs ?\
[14:45	<Lieutenant>	tyler: 2-3 weeks, i'v got 6 and 7 on CD that way
[14:45	<Paavi2_0>	psych: ctrl+c
[14:45	<psych>	i did that
[14:45	<Lieutenant>	tyler: thanks for your help.
[14:45	<tyler>	Leiutneant: Idont know if they ship out the alternate cd, either.
[14:45	<psych>	but when apt-get install
[14:45	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: so you've got no special cable clients running on the ubuntu box, you just use plain dhcp?
[14:45	<mut80r>	johnmike: after disabling DHCP you will no longer get any addresses from your network so you'd need to enter them manually into every machine on your network
[14:45	<psych>	it asks for restart that Paavi2_0
[14:45	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yes.
[14:45	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: wud u recommend using a filesystem other than EXT3? wud that hav repercussions on my beautifully running hardy?
[14:45	<psych>	it says 1 not fully installed or removed.
[14:46	<jim_beam>	cut copy paste are single keys on keyboard -- real convenient.  maybe edit xorg.conf
[14:46	<psych>	i wanna abort samba installation
[14:46	<psych>	for ever
[14:46	<mumu_>	i installed eclipse on ubuntu. I am reading the eclipse tutorial ( http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/concepts/cdt_c_build_over.htm ) where it says i should select the "Hello world c++ project" project type. But there is no this project type. Why is that, am i missing something?
[14:46	<psych>	any thoughts?
[14:46	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I'll go there now and try to connect another machine, see if that has the same issues. will also check with wireshark to see if anything is off
=== LainIwak1ra is now known as LainIwakura
[14:46	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: I would not reccomend running *nix on anything other than EXT2/3. both are unrecognisable to windows but you can get a program to open EXT3 filesystems.
[14:46	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: ok
[14:46	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: thanks for your time
[14:46	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: no problem
[14:46	<tj__>	 I just installed 8.04 and i cannot get a screen resolution above 640x480  i have the restricted drivers installed for my nvidia
[14:47	<mut80r>	tj__: have you restarted after enabling the drivers?
[14:47	<tj__>	yes
[14:47	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ok! How do I make sure than my Ubuntu box is listening on the ports I need it to?
[14:47	<mut80r>	johnmike: that all depends on the program you're running that needs the ports forwarded.
[14:47	<tyler>	tj_: try manually editing xorg.conf
[14:47	<tj__>	path?
[14:48	<mut80r>	tj__: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
=== Blue-Omega_ is now known as Blue-Omega
[14:48	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah. I'm just trying to set it up mainly for transmission, but someone had told me that I had to be careful when selecting a port for use because specific ports are reserved for specific things.
[14:49	<mut80r>	johnmike: select any port you want above 30000 as a safe rule. they can go up to 65535.
[14:49	<A[D]minS>	xmms on hardy ?
[14:49	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ah...ok!
[14:49	<nads>	thanks guys! I'm ashamed to say but the BIOS boot order fixed it :)
[14:49	<johnmike>	mut80r: Thanks!
[14:49	<mut80r>	johnmike: no problem.
[14:49	<mut80r>	nads: great =]
[14:50	<MttJocy>	mut80r, You resolved it?
[14:50	<mut80r>	Mttjocy: no. I was congratulating him.
[14:50	<tj__>	i see nothing in xorg.conf about screen resolution do you know what line i should add i have a monitor that should be at 1680x1050
[14:50	<MttJocy>	On?
[14:50	<mut80r>	Mttjocy: sorting out his booting process with the BIOS.
[14:51	<MttJocy>	Ah
[14:52	<linkmaster03>	Have the repos calmed down, is it a good time to get Hardy?
[14:52	<otarid>	Hi, I'm having trouble getting connected to wireless networks after upgrading to 8.04, my network card is Intel Pro/Wireless 3945 (also the wireless on/off LED doesn't work anymore, not that it matters..)
[14:52	<larry_>	ok finally found the gpg and installed it and got play on linux installed
[14:52	<mut80r>	linkmaster03: still under heavy load I believe.
[14:53	<linkmaster03>	Ok thanks
[14:53	<larry_>	thanks graingert
[14:53	<mut80r>	linkmaster03: if you're downloading and installing fresh, use the torrents. otherwise (if upgrading), wait a few weeks.
[14:53	<linkmaster03>	Heh ok
[14:53	<otarid>	Wireless does work if I pick the older kernel version (-14?) from the boot screen, but that gives me issues with nvidia graphic card
[14:53	<tj__>	mut80r:did you see my reply
[14:53	<mut80r>	ï»¿on a side note, anyone know how I can disable join/part notices in Pidgin?
[14:53	<niteye>	i installed ubuntu, and after GRUB it just says "cannot mount selected partition"
[14:54	<bod_>	hey lads -- so since ive upgraded to hardy ive lost all sound and cant find a problem anywhere ive even blacklistedmy onboard card -- when i type aplay -l i get 4/5 listings of the same card,.,.when i type aplayi get -- ALSA lib pcm.c:2106:(snd_pcm_open_conf) Cannot open shared library /usr/lib/alsa-lib/libasound_module_pcm_pulse.so aplay: main:546: audio open error: No such file or directory -- does this mean something to anyo
[14:54	<bod_>	ne?
[14:54	<mut80r>	tj__: no
[14:54	<josh04_>	otarid: Still here? ;)
[14:54	<otarid>	yeah josh04_, I've tried everything :(\
[14:54	<nibsa1242b>	linkmaster03: you can probably find a repo that works out well for you... I got lucky with ftp.usf.edu (American Repo)... got over 1GB of updates in an hour and a half
[14:54	<tj__>	i tried to edit xorg.conf but i see nothing about screen resolution
[14:54	<niteye>	i installed ubuntu, and after GRUB it just says "cannot mount selected partition", previous version worked fine, what's going on here?
[14:55	<mut80r>	tj__: there should be a "Mode" line under "Devices". duplicate this line and adjust it for your resolution.
[14:55	<pastorblue>	Can anyone help with screen resolution, please? List shows 'cloned screen' and max 800 X 600, my laptop does 1280 x 800
[14:55	<moncky>	hey I have ./configure but when I make I get undefined reference `tgoto'
[14:55	<tyler>	tj_: In the section "Screen", subsection "Display", add a line that says Modes: "your resolution"
[14:55	<mut80r>	moncky: code typo probably. needs to be goto not tgoto
[14:56	<josh04_>	otarid: I'd offer to help, but I don't know anything about intel cards : /

[14:56	<psicobra>	hmmm
[14:56	<tyler>	tj_: there should be no colon after "modes"

[14:57	<amir-ha>	Hi, I just installed Hardy on my laptop (which is working great with Gutsy), I have an intel 3945ABG wireless network card. And on gutsy it doesn't work good - I can't find any wireless networks. In the restricted hardware wizard I don't see the driver at all (in Gutsy I see it). modprobe -l shows the the drivers module is loaded (iw3945). I ran out of ideas how to tackle this, any suggestion?
[14:57	<minus198>	mut80r: but.. I cant find that "hardware driver manager"..
[14:57	<josh04_>	Superlad: ls -n /dev/disk/by-uuid

[15:00	<gausus>	is there a way to install ubuntu packages from network, and not from the cd?
[15:00	<nibsa1242b>	minus198: you need to have the wireless turned on for the system to know its there... you probably don't have to reboot just press the key combo to turn the card on
[15:00	<josh04_>	gausus: Try burning the CD at a low speed
[15:00	<z0g>	gausus, this was questioned before... edit the CD out of the /etc/apt/sources.list by placing a # in front
[15:00	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: ok, I'm following you

[15:16	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: wlan0 does not exist. did you try  eth1  ?
[15:16	<v3Rn>	it working fine in 7.10
[15:16	<graingert>	v3Rn: same as mine, install the nvidia, binary blob
[15:16	<SadDreamer>	!question Anyone can help with Compiz ?
[15:17	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Okay, try what I suggested then "killall -9 evolution" then once it is not running type "mv ~/.evolution ~/.evolution-bk"
[15:17	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: and I've already done gconftool-2 --set /apps/evolution/mail/display/show_preview --type bool 0 which is supposed to disable the preview plane for e-mail so that if an e-mail was causing the problem it would be eliminated...
[15:17	<john47>	hey all - trying to mount windows in hardy so that it comes up whenever I boot ubuntu.  I installed 8.04 WITHIN windows (Wubi install).  I'm running windows 2000. Ideas?
[15:17	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Then try starting it, perhaps something got corrupted
[15:17	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb: when I do a iwconfig, wlan0 is the only thing with information next to it.
[15:17	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: ok... doing that now
[15:17	<graingert>	SadDreamer what is the problem?
[15:17	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: try eth1 anyway.
[15:17	<ifireball>	dsch04: yes, since 7.04 I think, you need to install a different kernel and the user space tools from the repositories though (YMMV)
[15:17	<_paradox_>	anyone?
[15:17	<matt444>	since upgrading to hardy i know longer have the "lock screen option"
[15:17	<SadDreamer>	eh...
[15:17	<jarle>	so, if I install ubuntu 64 bit version, I am only able to run applications compiled for 64 bit on that machine?
[15:17	<Beererde>	vistakiller: crashes
[15:18	<regis>	_paradox_, which new ubuntu?
[15:18	<Beererde>	jarle: no
[15:18	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb: "error........no such device"
[15:18	<vistakiller>	use envyng-gtk?
[15:18	<Beererde>	jarle: you can run all apps
[15:18	<mut80r|brb>	jarle: no. 64-bit can run 64-bit and 32-bit apps
[15:18	<_paradox_>	the newest one
[15:18	<Beererde>	vistakiller: i did
[15:18	<_paradox_>	hardy
[15:18	<Beererde>	vistakiller: crashes in python at the end somewhere
[15:18	<dmsuperman_>	I wrote a small bash script (both to learn bash and to make rotating weekly system backups). I have it just tar my whole installation, as I haven't figured out yet how I might do incremental or differential backups. My question is, how can I make it so when I run this script it will execute as root? Right now I just have it do sudo tar... in the script but then it asks for a password
[15:18	<maat_>	m
[15:18	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb: This is a 3 year old dell.  I was hoping the wi-fi would just work.
[15:18	<regis>	_paradox_, it's already out
[15:18	<mehrab>	why I cant change my keyboard layout with Alt+Alt?
[15:18	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Then of course when you start it again it should present you with it's setup wizard again, work your way through that and see if it works normally again once it passes the wizard and is running fully.
[15:19	<_paradox_>	when it gonna be in the update manager? it hasnt notified me yet
[15:19	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: hmm. I don't know then. sorry
[15:19	<john47>	hey all - trying to mount windows in hardy so that it comes up whenever I boot ubuntu.  I installed 8.04 WITHIN windows (Wubi install).  I'm running windows 2000. Ideas?
[15:19	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb: like I said, there is information in there for "wlan0" so I'm assuming there isn't a driver issue?
[15:19	<Beererde>	vistakiller: in python pulse.py nvidia
[15:19	<ifireball>	dmsuperman: you place it in one of the /etc/cron.* directories
[15:19	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: no driver issue.
[15:19	<jarle>	Beererde: so if I have a 64 bit cpu there is no reason for me to think twice about which distro to install?
[15:19	<regis>	_paradox_, stange it should have noticied you
[15:19	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: you place it in one of the /etc/cron.* directories
[15:19	<vistakiller>	try to terminal envyng -t
[15:19	<mut80r|brb>	jarle: no. use 64-bit
[15:19	<Zacaa>	Hi
[15:19	<regis>	_paradox_, which ubuntu version do you have.
[15:19	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: hmm... no setup window and everything is still unselectable
[15:19	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb: Thanks for trying.
[15:19	<regis>	_paradox_, which ubuntu version do you have?
[15:19	<vistakiller>	with sudo
[15:19	<demonicanima>	I'm having trouble upgrading to 8.04 from 7.10 it fails at "Preparing to upgrade/Checking package manager".  Happens with both network and alternate cd upgrade methods.  Any clue on how to get Gutsy to upgrade short of a clean install?
[15:19	<Zacaa>	could someone please help me with my nvidia graphics driver installproblem?
[15:19	<giorgio>	Hi all.
[15:20	<_paradox_>	7.10 gutsy
[15:20	<mut80r|brb>	on a side-note I just realised my name.
=== mut80r|brb is now known as mut80r
[15:20	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: What about if I want to manually add it to my /etc/crontab file?
[15:20	<graingert>	!tell SadDreamer about metaquestion
[15:20	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, This is odd :S
[15:20	<regis>	Zacaa, what's the problem? i had one and i resolved it
[15:20	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: tell me about it...
[15:20	<DarphBobo>	when i run rhythmbox some times gives a msg saying "invalid argument" and i can't play any audio in rhythmbox now.. also cpu usage shows 100%
[15:20	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r: know any regulars in here who might be wi-fi gurus?  It seems to be the only thing keeping me from going Ubuntu on this laptop.
=== soulrider_ is now known as soulrider
[15:20	<Zacaa>	regis: I've tried everything to install it but yet it just won't be configured, and it just work initialize
[15:20	<graingert>	!question >	SadDreamer
[15:20	<mut80r>	Crusader_Tech: no. but you could try the wifidocs
[15:20	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Well, might want to (with evolution closed again) move your settings directory back as we know it doesn't seam to be that.
[15:20	<KalEl>	hi i got firefox 3 when i updated to hardy - but windows still has firefox 2, would you happen to know any reason for that
[15:20	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, do you have a broadcom card?
[15:20	<Zacaa>	What was your problem? I've been trying all day long to get this working
[15:21	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: you can do that, but its a less modular approach, the default /etc/crontab file may also be overwritten by a future upgrade
[15:21	<mut80r>	KalEl: windows and ubuntu are seperate.
[15:21	<_paradox_>	it will be in update manager?
[15:21	<gapagos>	hey when im trying to set a new default opening program in Firefox, is there a way I can use the program launch command (like in a Terminal) because I can't find the actual program on my filesystem but I know it's there somewhere...  (It's Rhythmbox Music Player, command rhythmbox)
[15:21	<graingert>	KalEl: windows <>	ubuntu
[15:21	<minus198>	mut80r: Hm.. the light doesnt even switch when Im using livecd
[15:21	<quio>	I have my wireless working in roaming mode but when I try and set it up for manual mode to give myself a static IP address it will not connect or I do not know how to make it connect.  Does anyone know how I can do this please.  I am trying to set a static address so I cN PUT MY MACHINE ON THE dmz.
[15:21	<Crusader_Tech>	regis: it's the wi-fi card in a dell laptop, 3 years old, the one that's NOT an intel card.  The windows driver refers to it as a "Dell" wi-fi card.
[15:21	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: Is there a certain way to set it so it runs at a certain time of the day then?
[15:21	<mut80r>	minus198: I suspect your card. try re-seating it.
[15:21	<KalEl>	ok
[15:21	<regis>	Zacaa, i had also an initialization problem...i had to:blacklist the wrong modules and autoload the good one
[15:21	<Zacaa>	I've tried envyng, synaptic, and I've tried downloading the run file from the nvidia website, tried them all but yet, still not working
[15:22	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, But to be honest with you I am kind of at a loss, after you upgraded to hardy it worked, did you install any other updates or new software after you installed hardy (and before evolution broke)
[15:22	<minus198>	mut80r: how? its a laptop o.
[15:22	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, lspci? (pastebin)
[15:22	<giorgio>	I've try to compile kvirc on kubunut remix and configure give me  http://rafb.net/p/MbY90146.html.
[15:22	<graingert>	dmsuperman_: anachronistc
[15:22	<vistakiller>	Zacaa what card you have?
[15:22	<Areli1>	ï»¿Does the "RadeonHD 3870" video card work with Ubuntu?
[15:22	<Zacaa>	Nvidia 6200
[15:22	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: well I'm looking at System Monitor, killall didn't seem to kill all evolution processes... evolution-alarm-notify, evolution-data-server-2.22, and evolution-exchange-storage are still running
[15:22	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: I'm going to kill them now
[15:22	<minus198>	mut80r: and it worked in windows
[15:22	<regis>	_paradox_, if you have feisty you could help me...which wine version does feisty have?
[15:22	<giorgio>	How do know the error?
[15:22	<Crusader_Tech>	regis: it's showing as broadcom, yes.
[15:22	<mut80r>	minus198: you should be able to remove a panel from the bottom. disconnect the antennas from the miniPCI card, take it out, plug it back in and reconnect. be careful with the antenna sockets, they're fragile. (pigtails)
[15:22	<Zacaa>	How did you blacklist the wrong modules regis?
[15:22	<vistakiller>	have you try to install the 96.43 driver?
[15:23	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Okay, try killing all the evolution processes then
=== mizai_ is now known as mizai
[15:23	<_paradox_>	i dont have feisty
[15:23	<regis>	Zacaa, what card do you have?
[15:23	<_paradox_>	i have gutsy
[15:23	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: you can use the /etc/cron.d directory but its a little more complicated then simply dropping the script in /etc/cron.weekly since you actually have to write a cron entry
[15:23	<minus198>	mut80r: Ok.. Ill give it a shot.
[15:23	<Zacaa>	Nvidia 6200
[15:23	<regis>	_paradox_, oops i mean gutsy...the one before hardy
[15:23	<Zacaa>	apparently I should use the nvidia-new drivers which is what I've been installing
[15:23	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: I'm not afraid of writing cron entries ;)
[15:23	<mut80r>	minus198: if that doesn't work, I suggest you call for help from the manufacturer, but as it is 3 years old this may be a problem
[15:23	<pwm>	ifireball, I'm trying to get a remote login to gdm
[15:23	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Then see if after doing that evolution will load (with your profile directory moved back to it's normal name that is)
[15:23	<Crusader_Tech>	regis: am I safe to assume it's not a driver issue at this point?
[15:23	<_paradox_>	and im waiting for the new ubuntu thru update manager
[15:24	<quio>	 I have my wireless working in roaming mode but when I try and set it up for manual mode to give myself a static IP address it will not connect or I do not know how to make it connect.  Does anyone know how I can do this please.  I am trying to set a static address so I can put my machine on dmz.
[15:24	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: ok, I think that fixed it... I can click on things now.
[15:24	<_paradox_>	i dont know anything about wine
[15:24	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: by all means then, place a file containing the desired entry in /etc/cron.d
[15:24	<sobczyk>	hi, is there a way to install localisation for firefox 3?
[15:24	<mut80r>	_paradox_: it's available. just slow at the moment.
[15:24	<ifireball>	pwm: with XDMCP?
[15:24	<regis>	Zacaa, do you know where i could paste the procedure in order to benefit to more people?
[15:24	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: Alright, thanks :D
[15:24	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, lspci...
[15:24	<_paradox_>	so i should be notified soon?
[15:24	<pwm>	ifireball: yes
[15:24	<Zacaa>	How about the forums?
[15:24	<kevin4381>	is compiz-fusion installed by default? if nto, what is its name in package manager?
[15:24	<Zacaa>	ubuntu forums?
[15:24	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, oops
[15:24	<graingert>	regis: pastebox
[15:24	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Cool, sounds probable then that one of it's supporting services froze up which stopped the main process working properly then
[15:24	<kevin4381>	in 8.04
[15:24	<ifireball>	pwm: what seems to be the problem?
[15:24	<bazhang>	!paste | regis

[15:25	<graingert>	!pastebin
[15:25	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: what is strange is that even with my profile directory still named as the backup, my e-mail address and such is already there... ok well time to move my old profile dir back
[15:25	<pwm>	ifireball is there a way to go somewhere with less traffic?
[15:25	<giorgio>	I've try to compile kvirc on kubunut remix and configure give me  http://rafb.net/p/MbY90146.html.

[15:25	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: yep, sounds like it. Thanks for your help.
[15:25	<Crusader_Tech>	regis: i'm typing to you now on a different machine.  But I did the lspci, and the last line referrs to a broadcom a/b/g card.
[15:25	<rohan>	is the openjdk java 6 distributed in ubuntu almost the same as sun's distribution? do i still need to have both installed? can i have both installed?
[15:25	<Beererde>	how can i see at which poiunt the nvidia driver fails? i tried both glx and glx-new
[15:25	<bazhang>	giorgio: best ask in #kubuntu-kde4
[15:25	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, it's not a driver issue but a firmware issue...look inside restricted hardware
[15:25	<akonkwa>	ersion of ubuntu I'm using ?
[15:25	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, be shure to enable all repos before
[15:25	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Might be interesting to check if this behaviour is repeatable, try doing the same thing you did just when it crashed the first time, see if it something random or a specific bug.
[15:25	<mut80r>	regis: hardware drivers    on hardy
[15:26	<bazhang>	akonkwa: lsb_release -a in the terminal
[15:26	<dan>	I cant get my 8.04 alternate cd to burn
[15:26	<graingert>	akonda: check in about gnome, System:about gnome
[15:26	<akonkwa>	bazhang,  thanx
[15:26	<ttt-->	hi, how come the tracker doesnt find any files? i put all the checkboxes to enable
[15:26	<giorgio>	Thk bazhang!
[15:26	<Crusader_Tech>	regis: so I'm going to have to hard wire to ethernet, and hopefully I'll get a driver after enabling all repositories?
[15:26	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Because if it is repeatable might be a good idea to submit a bug report to the evolution team.
[15:26	<umbrualbert>	Hi..Is this the Hardy Chatroom
[15:26	<bazhang>	dan what errors are you getting
[15:26	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: ok, I'll try... seriously though all I was doing was booting up the computer and starting up evolution
[15:26	<mut80r>	Crusader_Tech: you have the driver. it needs to DL the firmware.
[15:26	<bazhang>	umbrualbert: aye
[15:26	<akonkwa>	Is it possible to upgrade from dapper to the current release ?
[15:27	<_paradox_>	i hope ill be notified thru update manager at least in the next day or two

[15:27	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, I mean not fully running (ie in use)
[15:27	<Zacaa>	regis are you going to make a post on the forums or where do you think would be good?

[15:31	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Yeah, well if it happens again you know how to fix it at least :) probably something silly like a small fluctuation in the mains voltage or something lol

[15:33	<pwm>	ifireball - howto find that out? I was working OK with gentoo before I installed ubuntu
[15:33	<bazhang>	frold: you can use google mail for that--apt-cache search gmail for the program in the repos
[15:33	<dmsuperman_>	minus198: There have been times where I only install a simple nvidia video driver and then my vista becomes unbootable. Then reinstalling that exact same driver after reinstalling vista, and it works fine
[15:33	<z0g>	Dante123, dunno
[15:33	<z0g>	ubuntu, it is
[15:33	<albech>	anyone have the 3945ABG intel wireless network working?
[15:33	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: we had to install vista for testing at work. I burned the drive afterward =P
[15:33	<graingert>	albech: yes it works out of box!
[15:33	<_paradox_>	so whats the hold up?
[15:33	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: I think maybe it didn't crash gracefully and that was the issue. I'm connected to a UPS with voltage regulation, so my voltate doesn't fluctuate
[15:33	<z0g>	vista-hate is overrated
[15:34	<albech>	graingert: didnt work after i upgraded :(
[15:34	<MttJocy>	gapagos, Hey, no problem lol, it's worth remembering though that most (nearly all) IRC channels have a # at the start of their name (there are some special types of channels that have some other character but generally it's # unless otherwise stated lol)
[15:34	<znh>	Hello. I have no sound since I upgraded to Hard Henson. Any clues?
[15:34	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: more to that. one of my friends had vista and he shutdown and updates were doing... then he booted up the next day and chkdsk ran and got rid of ALL his files. the pointers in the filesystem.
[15:34	<ifireball>	ifireball: I see, try running "host <ip.of.client.here>" on the server and make sure you get the right name back
[15:34	<bazhang>	albech is this a fresh hardy install or an upgrade
[15:34	<un2him>	PriceChild: sorry, i meant the xserver-xgl driver.  Is that a replacement for the nvidia driver?
[15:34	<ifireball>	pwm: I see, try running "host <ip.of.client.here>" on the server and make sure you get the right name back
[15:34	<albech>	bazhang: upgrade
[15:34	<dmsuperman_>	z0g: Quite a bit of the hate for vista is based on nothing, but many of us who actually use it and know what we're talking about have valid arguments
[15:34	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Oh well, no point worrying over it anyway lol, weird things happen sometimes I guess lol
[15:34	<PriceChild>	un2him: you don't want to use that, no :)
[15:34	<graingert>	albech: poned, no but really did you try modprobing the iwl driver?

[15:36	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, lol, heh you figured it out for yourself, I never even considered the fact there may be more than one process used by evolution lol (Although I have never used the program so have never seen it's processes on my machine of course).
[15:36	<un2him>	Dante123: make sure you update your sources first, then go to hardware drivers again, this time you should be able to select it
[15:36	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: awesome. I got so sick of windows about a month ago that i finally just sat down and came up with a list of apps that I absolutely need, and found alternatives. Then I installed Ubuntu, and the only time I boot XP now is for games and photoshop :D
[15:36	<graingert>	Dante123: now add it to your menu.list in grub
[15:36	<Dante123>	so graingert, what else might be the problem?
[15:36	<mikebot>	Oh, I have another question: My tracker hasn't been indexing--when I try to re-index, it disappears from the panel, and I have to re-open it with like `tracker-applet' (in which case there is then two in the panel), and it still hasn't indexed anything... ANyone know why this is happening?
[15:36	<graingert>	Dante123: there is no problme
[15:36	<giggsey>	Is there a way to get rid of that audiopulse crap? It crashes on login for me
[15:36	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: for photoshop and games, use ReactOS. I have a dualboot on here with that and this (hardy).

[15:37	<pwm>	ifireball: could it be an ipv6 problem?
[15:37	<graingert>	Dante123: debian has a special way of playing things with grub
[15:37	<MttJocy>	bagelong, Possibly not the best channel to ask about windows issues to be fair although maybe some people here might have some pointers for you I guess.
[15:37	<Dante123>	okay, well I am still a skeptic because the original boot prob is sporadic anyway.  Sometimes it boots fine on first try.  But I will do as you say and see if the hangs are done.
[15:37	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: I haven't ever heard of that, what is it?

[15:40	<MttJocy>	pwm, But in netstat it is not bound to any IPv4 addresses?
[15:40	<bazhang>	albech best to try the livecd and verify what I said--it worked for me, but worksforme may not for you
[15:40	<weary>	ubuntu boots up but i get 'ALERT /dev/sda1<garbled>	does not exist. Dropping to a shell'. where does the garbage after the devicename come from?

[15:40	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: just to see what it's like :P
[15:40	<pwm>	MttJocy correct netstat doesn't have any ipv4 port 177 application listed

[15:48	<_paradox_>	alright well ty maybe ill get lucky and update manager will notify me by the end of the day about hardy
[15:48	<ofh>	hi
[15:48	<ghostknife>	My system is overloading available resources. It seems to be trackerd. How do I turn this off? I never use it
[15:48	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: I don't know anything about bz2. sorry
[15:48	<ghostknife>	And how do I clean up the indexes.
[15:48	<bazhang>	gmenelau: is this kde3 or kde4
[15:48	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_:  seems right
[15:48	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: what do you want to know about bz2?
[15:48	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: no worries :S
[15:48	<tseug>	hello i cannot access my Home folder. neither through the icon nor through a shell.  however, i can access the folders WITHIN home folder... how can i fix this?
[15:48	<bagelong>	bazhang:  thanks.  I'll check it out.
[15:48	<josh04_>	bagelong: Same ;) Also, I found some help on how to fix it
[15:48	<ofh>	someone that can help on firefox prob ??
[15:48	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: See my above question. basically my bz2 compression results in 0 byte files
[15:49	<josh04_>	bagelong: Have you changed anything since last night?
[15:49	<mut80r>	tseug:  chown username /home/username/ -R
[15:49	<RoRza>	anyone knows where I can install the Subverion or SVN ubuntu from
[15:49	<bagelong>	josh04:  just tried another driver through windows wireless driver utility to no avail
[15:49	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64524/
[15:49	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: try doing: tar -cpvf (leave the j). and use the extension ".tar". thereafter try do do: bzip2 <file>
[15:49	<robert__>	does anyone know how to use a regular picture for the login screen background?
[15:49	<gmenelau>	bazhang what is kde3 or kde 4 ?
[15:49	<josh04_>	bagelong: Apparently we need to add something to /etc/rc.local
[15:49	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: That's what I thought, but it always outputs bz2 files. Even a simple command, compressing a single file like that makes it 0 bytes
[15:49	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: alright lemme try that real quick
[15:49	<ghostknife>	robert__: kde/gnome?
[15:50	<bazhang>	gmenelau: you are using kopete with gnome? or with kde?  (ubuntu or kubuntu)
[15:50	<bagelong>	josh04:  Is that the full line?
[15:50	<robert__>	gnome
[15:50	<RoRza>	anyone knows where I can install the Subverion or SVN ubuntu from
[15:50	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: may it be directory-location related? e.g you're running the command from the wrong place?
[15:50	<josh04_>	bagelong: Did the new driver say "device present" without needing ndiswrapper -a devid device?
[15:50	<ghostknife>	anyone know of some fast search tool in ubuntu (that uses tracker-search-tool)?
[15:50	<ghostknife>	ifireball: it worked with gzip
[15:50	<Crusader_Tech>	regis: I am now talking to you from my laptop via wireless.  Thank you VERY much!
[15:50	<Nalleman>	hi, how do I install openGL support?
[15:50	<ice-man>	hi is there a way to disable aptitude's systray icon when i use apt ??
[15:50	<tseug>	mut80r, it says no such file or directory?!
[15:50	<gmenelau>	bazhang i use gnome  ubuntu
[15:50	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: I can't see anything majorly wrong there that would stop it working. try joining #compiz-fusion
[15:50	<bagelong>	josh04:  just says invalid driver.  Now the other one - the one we installed last night, says it too.
[15:51	<mut80r>	tseug: try adding sudo infront of it.
[15:51	<vicky123_>	hi everybody, i hav pentiun dual core processor. so which ubuntu i should download. (PC (Intel x86) desktop CD or 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD)?
[15:51	<eternal_p>	ice-man: it isn't aptitude per-say it is Update Manager, and I don't think yo ucan do it
[15:51	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: a'right.. thanks...
[15:51	<Wile>	How are the NTFS disks of the machines detected ? I have one partition missing in /media...
[15:51	<josh04_>	bagelong: How odd. Can you remove them both with ndiswrapper -r?
[15:51	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: That works. I am running this to backup 5GB worth of data though, so would it be a whole lot slower to archive and then compress as you suggested?
[15:51	<eternal_p>	vicky123_: you will be better served, if you are new to ubuntu to use the x86 rather than 64-bit
[15:51	<tseug>	mut80r, same thing 'No such file or directory'
[15:51	<bazhang>	vicky123_: depends on you; both will support dual core
[15:51	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r: regis was able to get me going. Thank you for taking the time to try to help me.
[15:51	<bagelong>	josh04:  I tried ndiswrapper -r and it will not work.  Had to remove them from the utility.
[15:51	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: well, it would have to do it in 2 steps instead of one
[15:51	<mut80r>	tseug: looks like a bad filesystem to me.
[15:51	<mut80r>	Crusader_Tech: no problem
[15:52	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: can we do this in private, this channel is too busy? i'll help you fix it
[15:52	<robert__>	is gnome hard to customize the login?
[15:52	<vicky123_>	thanx to both
[15:52	<un2him>	can someone tell me how to automatically do the /msg nickserv identify command upon startup?  I hate having to type it in every time.  using xchat-gnome.
[15:52	<Dante123>	earth to graingert
[15:52	<ghostknife>	robert__: not really a factor. I just need to know what to tell you
[15:52	<mut80r>	robert__: System ->	Administration ->	Login Window ->	Local tab
[15:52	<jelle>	hey
[15:52	<tseug>	mut80r, i have some important files in there, anyway i can copy/paste those files to another place like desktop?
[15:52	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: sure, but I'm not quite sure how to open a private message window in irssi =P
[15:52	<josh04_>	bagelong: that's fine. Just give me a moment, I'm trying to find a driver for your device id
[15:52	<DinCahill>	hi. i want to install hardy, but it wont recognise my ide hard drives which i want to use. it recognises my sata drivbes fine

[15:52	<M2>	Hey guys, do any of you know how I would go about installing something known as pixbuf engine for GTK2? : (
[15:52	<jelle>	someone how knows a good site to prepare for the ubuntu certification, please?
[15:52	<awaw>	thank you for the help guys, computers_with_linux_installed++;
[15:52	<bagelong>	josh04: let it go for now.  Got a 4 y.o. soccer game.  hope I find you later.
[15:52	<minus198>	mut80r: apparently my card needs a patch. It isn't supported in the 2.6.24 kernel.
[15:52	<aroo>	un2him, there should be a field to input "Nickserv password" when you are configuring server settings
[15:53	<tseug>	mut80r, what does cp stand for?
[15:53	<eternal_p>	Dincahill: do you have your IDE drives turned on in your bios?
[15:53	<mut80r>	minus198: I thought you had a BCM4311?
[15:53	<josh04_>	bagelong: I'll leave this on, try and spot you when you get back :P

[15:53	<DinCahill>	this is a livecd
[15:53	<DinCahill>	i dont have gutsy installed at the minute
[15:53	<ifireball>	M2: install the gtk2-engines-pixbuf package with Synaptic (should be installed by default AFAIK)
[15:54	<DinCahill>	i wiped and im starting again
[15:54	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: check you have a new window. just press alt+[nr] to goto it
[15:54	<eternal_p>	Dincahill: ahh..I remember something about the way that gutsy handles hard drives, but I have not heard in a long time about any issues with it reading IDE drives to be honest with you
[15:54	<tockitj>	how to display computer stats on desktop (something like kde superkaramba -- i'd like to see cpu, mem and network usage) :-)
[15:54	<M2>	Ok, thanks : D
[15:54	<Alan>	Have there been any core updates to hardy since the release?
[15:54	<mut80r>	Alan: not that I know of.
[15:54	<Alan>	For some reason, I've had no updates since the 23rd
[15:54	<eternal_p>	tockitj: screenlets 0.1 is the best out there
[15:54	<eternal_p>	tockitj: it isn't in the repos yet, just download the .deb
[15:54	<un2him>	aroo: thanks, i found the correct field, i will restart and see what happens!
[15:54	<mut80r>	Alan: because the 23rd images were used for the release.
[15:54	<Alan>	Ah, fair enough... was just worrying that maybe there should have been
[15:54	<tockitj>	thanks
[15:54	<DinCahill>	ok thanks anyway eternal_p

[15:55	<eternal_p>	RoRza: sudo apt-get install svn
[15:55	<Alan>	mut80r, i didn't install from the 23rd images, i installed from the 18th (when release candidate was first available)
[15:55	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: you there?

[15:56	<DinCahill>	is there a way i can get ubuntu to list the drives it recognises?
[15:56	<mut80r>	minus198: it worked out of the box for me on 7.10
[15:56	<un2him>	aroo: thanks, that did the trick!
[15:56	<__max_>	im getting: Dhcdbd: message_handler: message handler not found under /com/redhat/dhcp/eth0 that suddenly crashes my entire friggin swithc.

[15:56	<Alan>	mut80r, tried both "main server" and "united kindom", no updates apparently...
[15:56	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: are you identified/registered?

[15:57	<mut80r>	minus198: rev 01
[15:57	<eternal_p>	simonft2: it is a command "hostname" which will set the name of your computer
[15:57	<ifireball>	RoRza: try Synaptic, the Add/Remove contains only large GUI software AFAIK svn is a small command line tool
[15:57	<minus198>	mut80r: cause rev1 works nativly in 8.04. But rev2 doesn't work.
[15:57	<nox-Hand>	Greetings
[15:57	<RoRza>	eternal_p, : its SVN and Subversion the same thing ?

[15:59	<_paradox_>	yesterday i had to reset my cable modem and router for a minute. is possible i missed the update manager's notification about hardy?
[15:59	<El1>	NinthWave: I think so, my problem is that when I install the drivers after X restart it turns to low-res mode, but I think it has the same cause, since we both have no gfx acceleration I assume
[15:59	<eternal_p>	_paradox_: umm no
[16:00	<mut80r>	anyoen know how I can disable join/part notices in Pidgin ?

[16:01	<NinthWave>	El1 I opened a conversation with you.  Please come in
[16:01	<DinCahill>	neocortex: you mean you can boot in to windows but you cannot see the partition in ubuntu?
[16:01	<_paradox_>	what about sudo? would it be as easy to install that way?
[16:01	<josh04_>	tseug: you need to use -r

[16:01	<simonft2>	won't let me save it

[16:07	<un2him>	KooperKool: give soundconverter a try.
[16:07	<KooperKool>	ok
[16:08	<eternal_p>	mut80r: there you go
[16:08	<erUSUL>	chazco: have you tried to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove quiet and splash from the kernel line? that disables the progress bar and you an see what is going on

[16:08	<KooperKool>	un2him: Where do I get that?
[16:08	<chazco>	erUSUL - Yep, i did it from grub... it seems to pause on something to do with ACPI and SCSI (which i dont have)/SATA... no errors though
[16:08	<regis>	what was the wine version of ubuntu gusty?
[16:09	<amenado>	chazco out of curiousity, what does your grub entry look like for this 8.04 to boot? can you paste it? should only be about 3-4 lines
[16:09	<bazhang>	chazco: try with adding acpi=off
[16:09	<eternal_p>	simonft2: go to sys: admin: network: unlock: general tab
[16:09	<un2him>	KooperKool: search for it in the repositories, using synaptic
[16:09	<Kilgariff>	Does anyone know if samba is slower than SSH?
[16:09	<erUSUL>	chazco: well sata drivers as well as usb-storage and others uses scsi kernel infrastructure to function
[16:09	<crashanddie>	erUSUL, that is very sketchy french that ubotu uses there...
[16:09	<chazco>	amenado - Just the default stuff... bazhang - It worked on Gusty, so i'm a bit unsure
[16:09	<regis>	does anyone still has gusty?
[16:09	<bazhang>	KooperKool: why convert? you can watch them with vlc
[16:09	<graphikeye>	hi everyone. I have a Ubuntu 8.04 live disk, and 7.10 installed. Whenever I try to install it, it asks me to create a mount point on my ext2 partition. Does this mean i will loose all my data?
[16:09	<erUSUL>	chazco: tried acpi=off on kernel line ?
[16:09	<KooperKool>	ok. Firefox has no audio (e.g. youtube.com)
[16:09	<simonft2>	ï»¿eternal_p: thanks
[16:09	<chazco>	Will try it, give me a moment
[16:09	<HACKhalo2>	is it possible to stick Ubuntu, Xubuntu, and Kubuntu on one disc, using a CD bootloader?
[16:09	<crashanddie>	KooperKool, install libflashsupport
[16:09	<yowshi>	cant anyone tell me with at least 9%% certainty that the upgrade to hardy is like stable and wont break if i do it?
[16:10	<erUSUL>	crashanddie: you can send and edit request if you like
[16:10	<eternal_p>	simonft2: np, this will do the same as editing the host file, so this should fix the problem
[16:10	<yowshi>	other then the need to reinstall video drivers of course
[16:10	<bazhang>	KooperKool: you might want to try youtube-dl and download the vids you like
[16:10	<crashanddie>	erUSUL, really ? Where ? How ?
[16:10	<Katowon>	KooperKool  your converting video?
[16:10	<N1NCHN41L5>	 ANYONE - wanna walk through my first sucessful dual linux os boot w/ me
[16:10	<amenado>	chazco im booting right now on 8.04 and the grub entry is bare minimum for mine, so id like to see yours to compare, and may shed some info
[16:10	<erUSUL>	crashanddie: /msg ubotu fr is <reply>whatever you want to and makes sense
[16:10	<sploby>	How do you make Dual-Monitor work on Hardy without have a blank screen every time you start the system?
[16:10	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41L5: if you primary os is windows, 8.04 does it automatically for you
[16:10	<KooperKool>	no, I mean my computer's sound is out. My Computer sound isn't working. My Volume is all the way up.
[16:10	<elmer>	I think 8.04 broke Nexuiz
[16:10	<anpiscinb>	&#538;/quit
[16:10	<bazhang>	yowshi: no such guarantees are possible; best to run the livecd and see how it does
[16:10	<crashanddie>	erUSUL, ok, thanks
[16:10	<ssam>	yowshi, depends how many changes you have made since you installed gutsy
[16:11	<esteth_>	yowshi: The upgrade process can not be made 100% stable. It has to deal with differences in everyones system. However if you were going to upgrade with a format anyway, it probably doesn't hurt to try the upgrade after your normal backup, and if it works it saves you a format
[16:11	<erUSUL>	crashanddie: ops of the channel hopefully will review and aprove
[16:11	<N1NCHN41L5>	i just insatlaled ubuntu on a 7.36g primary partition now i want to load PCLinuxOS
[16:11	<yowshi>	bazhang: i have no doubt that hardy is stable but upgrading is different from installing
[16:11	<Cola>	hi
[16:11	<bazhang>	yowshi: upgrades are fine
[16:11	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41L5: why not insatll it in virtualbox
[16:11	<chazco>	amenado - Theres a path the the kernel, a path to the initrd and the word "quiet"
[16:11	<N1NCHN41L5>	eternal_p: there will be NO windows on this comp
[16:11	<yowshi>	bazhang: cool then i can commence the upgrade process
[16:11	<ssam>	yowshi, if you have installed lots of third party stuff, or had to do lots of tweaks to make things work, then there is a higher chance of the upgrade breaking
[16:11	<simonft2>	ï»¿eternal_p: Thank you so much
[16:11	<amenado>	yowshi do like what i did, run a the iso from hard disk without installation, using your existing linux
[16:11	<N1NCHN41L5>	to slow only 256 ram PIII 1,2g cpu
[16:12	<simonft2>	ï»¿eternal_p: that completely fixed it

[16:12	<tseug>	how do i delete a directory including all it's contents
[16:12	<N1NCHN41L5>	if i want a diff disrto it needs to be on hdd
[16:12	<eternal_p>	simonft2: excellent, when in doubt, put the exact error in google with the word ubuntu at the end ;)
[16:12	<bazhang>	yowshi: do you have a bunch of third party repos or used third party installer scripts?
[16:12	<amenado>	chazco i do not have that on mine.. so i see every message the boot loader spits out
[16:12	<yowshi>	amenado: that would tell me something i am prety sure of already that hardy is stable. the ubuntu folks do a decent job with thier stuff
[16:12	<mut80r>	eternal_p: lol
[16:12	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41L5: you are probably asking for trouble, but grub can handle it, but I can't tell you how

[16:13	<N1NCHN41L5>	sorry
[16:13	<elmer>	can anyone on Hardy confirm or deny that Nexuiz is working?
[16:13	<bazhang>	yowshi: as always, back up first if you have not already
[16:13	<un2him>	KooperKool: sorry, man, that program is just for audio.  it will convert, but only audio.  my bad
[16:13	<N1NCHN41L5>	weird thing is this dino comp runs ubuntu with compiz better than plain cubuntu
[16:13	<graphikeye>	does creating a mount point on an existing ext2 partition erase the data on it?
[16:13	<tseug>	thanks erUSUL
[16:13	<chazco>	May go back to Gusty on the laptop
[16:13	<eternal_p>	elmer: there was a post about nexuiz in the development forum, I would google it for more info
[16:13	<mut80r>	graphikeye: no
[16:13	<yowshi>	amenado: my question was would -upgrading- using the upgrade feature break. i have found that upgrading and installing dont work the same. a basic install is easy and usualy stable an upgrade can break in funny ways
[16:13	<elmer>	eternal_p, thanks, I will
[16:13	<erUSUL>	tseug: no problem
[16:13	<eternal_p>	graphikeye: only if you click "format"
[16:13	<eternal_p>	:)
[16:14	<crashanddie>	graphikeye, of course not
[16:14	<pixelmonkey>	can someone point me to the FAQ entry about how I can get firefox2 back?  Firefox3 is nice and all, but most of the add-ons I'm used to don't work.
[16:14	<graphikeye>	so, if i want to install 8.04 over my existing 7.10 i should be ok?
[16:14	<mut80r>	pixelmonkey: I have it, hold on
[16:14	<bazhang>	pixelmonkey: install it
[16:14	<N1NCHN41L5>	graphikeye: just resize the partition in gparted
[16:14	<crashanddie>	graphikeye, eh ?
[16:14	<yowshi>	bazhang: i dont have the hard drive space to backup all my stuff
[16:14	<erUSUL>	!upgrade | graphikeye
[16:14	<ubotu>	graphikeye: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[16:14	<eternal_p>	pixelmonkey: if you google nightly tester tools you can make more of 'em working, outside of that there is a step by step in tips and tricks
[16:14	<amenado>	yowshi->	let me put it this way, my confidence in a fresh install is higher than an upgraded install..hows that?

[16:15	<sploby>	And no one can help me?
[16:15	<amenado>	tseug->	just like any other partitions, they are like directories once mounted
[16:15	<bazhang>	ask your question sploby
[16:15	<eternal_p>	sploby: what is your question?
[16:15	<N1NCHN41L5>	no ideas on a second linux os - i know it can be done seen threads guys sayt they got 6 plus
[16:15	<yowshi>	amenado: yeah but fresh means i lose everything i have installed including games and stuff and i dont want to go through and install everything some of it i dont know the name of i just use it now and then and i found it while browsing
[16:16	<sploby>	 How do you make Dual-Monitor work on Hardy without have a blank screen every time you start the system?
[16:16	<xionox>	hi
[16:16	<tseug>	amenado, i don't know where to find the directory
[16:16	<amenado>	yowshi now this is your call then, you take the plunge and start fresh or you fiddle and tweak til it satisfies your needs
[16:16	<xionox>	I need some help about backuppc :)
[16:16	<tseug>	amenado, i'm looking in "  ls /  "  but i only see a 'cdrom'
[16:16	<amenado>	tseug->	first it has to be mounted,
[16:16	<mut80r>	N1NCHN41L5: it can be done. run the PCLinuxOS installer and it should detect you have GRUB already and add itself to the boot menu.
[16:16	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41LS: http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-newbie/60680-linux-linux-dual-boot.html  (first result)
[16:16	<ssam>	N1NCHN41L5, most linux installers do a pretty good job of finding other linux distros and making a GRUB list to boot all of them
[16:16	<yowshi>	amenado: i'll fiddle i have a 50/50 track record with uphgrades. fiesty gave me touble but gutsy didnt
[16:16	<tseug>	amenado, how do i mount?
[16:17	<amenado>	tseug any storage devices has to be mounted first
[16:17	<amenado>	yowshi its your call..
[16:17	<mehrab>	why I cant change my keyboard layout (language) with Alt+Alt keys?
[16:17	<N1NCHN41L5>	ssam can i pm u and go through the stages - ive FU*KED up 3 times now with ubuntu and muppy008
[16:17	<Fritzel>	what signal is sent to an application to get it to try to safely exit?
[16:17	<bazhang>	N1NCHN41L5: language
[16:17	<N1NCHN41L5>	using PCLinuxOS cause i have official cd
[16:17	<N1NCHN41L5>	i editedit
[16:17	<alpharesearch>	where is the new icon in 8.04 to setup the video
[16:17	<amenado>	yowshi->	you have already made up your mind anyway, asking us seems wasteful
[16:17	<erUSUL>	Fritzel: the kill default signal
[16:18	<ssam>	N1NCHN41L5, ok
[16:18	<Fritzel>	ahh alright that makes it easy then
[16:18	<N1NCHN41L5>	but will be more catuis
[16:18	<Fritzel>	thank you
[16:18	<crashanddie>	mut80r, that firefox link you gave is really bad

[16:18	<Beererde>	hi. my gtk-window-decoration is not working. how can i fix it?=
[16:18	<yowshi>	amenado: well i know i will upgrade i was just wondering what the general excperience with this upgrade has been. have there been a large number of instances where it brokew
[16:18	<mut80r>	crashanddie: it worked for me. I'm on firefox-2. how is it bad ?
[16:18	<alpharesearch>	do i need to edit xorg.conf now?
[16:18	<yowshi>	amenado: if there were i would put it off maybe even until the next version
[16:18	<Konam>	hi, I just installed hardy and i want to know how to disable the shade of the top panel in the title bar of the windows i open
[16:18	<Konam>	?
[16:19	<crashanddie>	mut80r, they imply that 2 versions of firefox should not be installed at one given time
[16:19	<mut80r>	crashanddie: well, it's true, with conflicting configurations and all ..
[16:19	<amenado>	yowshi->	it just came out two days ago, and you expect in-depth experience and troubles listed already? come on...
[16:19	<sploby>	bazhang: Do you know?
[16:19	<yowshi>	amenado: crap i thought it came out on the first of april
[16:20	<crashanddie>	mut80r, it's not true at all, I have FF2 and FF3 at the same time, with no problems whatsoever
[16:20	<yowshi>	amenado: sorry i had my info wrong my bad
[16:20	<alpharesearch>	is there not a tool that can help to change form vesa to nvidia
[16:20	<bazhang>	mut80r: indeed you can have both
[16:20	<dassouki>	i upgraded to hardy yesterday, my sound isn't working I've tried the ! sound tutorial with no vain. lspci and ldconfig can see my card, nothing odd about dmesg. i've tried alsamixer and gstream-properties but nothing so far. can anyone help me please
[16:20	<crashanddie>	!firefox2
[16:20	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about firefox2 - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[16:20	<mut80r>	crashanddie: well, whatever works for you. :)   I wouldn't try both but will get rid of ff2 when ff3 final comes out.
[16:20	<landspite>	i'm having trouble with GDM under vmware, where is the screen resolution configured for gdm?
[16:21	<amenado>	landspite->	that would be same place as if you were running in native as opposed to vmware?
[16:21	<landspite>	where is that ;)
[16:21	<alpharesearch>	what is the command line name of the tool that was used in 7.10 to change the graphics card?
[16:22	<amenado>	landspite->	hunt around xorg.conf or System-->preferences

[16:28	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about ttf - try searching on http://ubotu.ubuntu-nl.org/factoids.cgi
[16:28	<schnootop>	eternal_p,  well i get that error i pasted and i am running mobility x2300 **
[16:28	<simmerz>	in gutsy, my back/forward buttons on my mouse were assigned to back/forward in firefox. they're not now. how do i get that back?
[16:28	<eternal_p>	schnootop: ah..good ol ati, I didn't see the error before, sorry
[16:28	<simmerz>	I'm now using hardy
[16:28	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: k.  that's the extent of my intelligent advice, alas.  but it might pay to read the grub man page.  perhaps you can manually install the boot sector on the external drive, if it's missing.  I assume the drive isn't coming up at all and you're not even getting grub.
[16:29	<red_>	mut80r i dont get you sorry. im now opening the link you just gave me
[16:29	<schnootop>	eternal_p, do you know if there are better drivers that i can use besides the defaults ?
[16:29	<calem_300>	haiii
[16:29	<N1NCHN41L5>	damn ssam said hed help - now hes GONE - anyone else can help maje 1st succesful linux dual boot
[16:29	<amenado>	alpharesearch->	ahh i found it     gksu displayconfig-gtk
[16:29	<mut80r>	red_: remove everything related to firefox through the synaptic package manager. reboot and use the synaptic package manager again to install firefox-2 and firefox-2-gnomesupport
[16:29	<eternal_p>	schnootop: I believe envy  uses new ati drivers
[16:29	<biro>	given a pid, how do I find out which user is running that process?
[16:30	<ssam>	N1NCHN41L5, i pm'ed you
[16:30	<schnootop>	someone told me to avoid envy :\
[16:30	<hilts50>	PhotoJim:  I'll take a look in there.  I shows as an option to boot to... When selected and the machine tries to boot it says in the command line that it can't find the boot device...
[16:30	<simmerz>	anyone? can't use back/forward mouse buttons in firefox, but the z and x axis buttons are set in Xorg.conf
[16:30	<eternal_p>	schnootop: yup, it is a risk, no question, but will load down a later driver
[16:30	<alpharesearch>	amenado: thanks a lot
[16:30	<red_>	mut80r thanks. be back in a while
[16:30	<eternal_p>	schnootop: the best thing is to throw the error into google with the word ubuntu @ the end
[16:30	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: ok, that's a bit different.  if you look at the grub screen, there will be an option to edit the boot command line.  something is awry in it.
[16:30	<Beererde>	still no decorations
=== DBautell_Intox is now known as DBautell
[16:30	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: don't reinstall the boot sector.  you clearly have one.
[16:30	<mut80r>	red_: take your time.
[16:31	<alpharesearch>	amenado: I just wonder if there is a new way of doing things now?
[16:31	<schnootop>	eternal_p, ive already tried that and still havent found a real solution :P
[16:31	<amenado>	alpharesearch->	i have the 7.10 ..launched it, looked in the ps status list, and picked off the command that launches it
[16:31	<eternal_p>	schnootop: get a nvidia card instead ;) lol
[16:31	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: I had a similar problem on a PC desktop once.  the grub config was trying to load the kernel from the wrong drive.  I manually corrected it, and all was good.
[16:31	<hilts50>	PhotoJim:  Any tips for what to look for in there?  :)
[16:31	<gapagos>	is there any good video editing program for ubuntu
[16:31	<cory_>	how do i get to the repositories dialog
[16:31	<gapagos>	like imovie

[16:31	<RHeLL>	I have a problem with my media shortcut... the mute button just mute the fronts speakers and not the PCM --- how can I put the mute button to mute PCM???
[16:31	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: I'm not a mac guy, sorry . :) but do some googling and see what hardware description external firewire drives usually have.
[16:32	<eternal_p>	gapagos: there is one listed in ubuntuguide.org I believe
[16:32	<amenado>	alpharesearch->	it may be hidden in some other icon?  we all are discovery mode for 8.04
[16:32	<ssam>	cory_, system->administration->software sources
[16:32	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: if you can boot off an Ubuntu CD you can look at the dmesg (kernel boot output) and see.
[16:32	<bebraw>	does anyone know how to fix flickering opengl apps in hardy (using desktop fx)?
[16:32	<alpharesearch>	amenado: it starts up in 8.04; looks like it also works

[16:43	<Creeture>	Hey kids. Is diald still the recommended solution for PPP dial-on-demand in Ubuntu?
[16:43	<PhotoJim>	Millertime_018: I've had good luck with upgrades in the past, and it saves me a ton of reconfigging.  I have tons of Firefox applets, keys for ssh authentication, etc.  so if I can upgrade, it will save me a ton of time. :)
[16:43	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: under the box that shows up when you double click the sound icon there is an edit menu with prefrences there. that will give you some enabling options
[16:43	<Fouad>	good afternoon  .. guys .. any idea why ubuntu cant see my usb mouse ?
[16:43	<auruspex>	Hello IRC peoples. I've been having some problem with the Compiz effects in Hardy and I'm at my wits end so I figure I'd come here to see if you guys had any ideas. The thread with details is here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=768121
[16:43	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: some computers require surround to be enabled
[16:43	<I5487>	Hi, i need help. i have downoaded the latest ubuntu, but when i type in another language its not fully support any idea regarding this issue?
[16:43	<J-Unit>	mut80r, o so pid means process id?
[16:43	<yahya__>	mut80r, i am not on the system, it keeps getting stuck on 70%, anything I can add to boot options to bypass it?
[16:43	<nith>	bazhang: virtual desktop is the linux original name for ubuntu's "workspaces"
[16:43	<gapagos>	video editing not yet ready for Ubuntu lol
[16:43	<amenado>	Creeture->	possibly, no other ones that can do such
[16:43	<Pinky>	I was hoping there was something like mod_proxy for ssh, so I wouldn't need to do anything w/ my firewall... oh well, I guess
[16:43	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, -15 is not necessary, SIGTERM is the default behaviour
[16:43	<mut80r>	J-Unit: yes. it's a numerical value assigned to each process.
[16:43	<AtomicSpark>	Haha. For lulz i opened my clock to see if gnome would freeze. it did. -_-
[16:43	<bazhang>	auruspex: best to ask in #compiz for that
[16:43	<PhotoJim>	I5487: type only in English?  OK, that's a wisecrack answer. ;)
[16:43	<Ntemis>	please help i have installed koverartist but it dont show on the applications area, when i start it from command line it says : kbuildsycoca running...  and then this: kio (KMimeType): WARNING: KServiceType::offers : servicetype ThumbCreator not found  and this is the same for 8 lines!!!
[16:43	<mut80r>	yahya__: stick a live cd in and mount your system and edit fstab there.
[16:43	<gapagos>	is there any way I could run iMovie on ubuntu since it's unix-based
[16:43	<auruspex>	bzhang: Thanks :)
[16:43	<J-Unit>	gapagos, cinelerra is the closest u get to premiere pro
[16:43	<bazhang>	nith: thanks for the info ;]
[16:43	<OllieA>	Can anyone tell me how to add a new screen res?
[16:44	<Dante123>	amenado I already have hardy installed on another pc....so I have a feel for it and I like it so far.  Would running the livecd basically pick up the non-integrated card and install properly or do you think I will have to go through all the hassles again?
[16:44	<JenFraggle>	please can someone help with a mouse problem on hardy.  thanks
[16:44	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, the one you're looking for (if a program locked up or doesn't respond to -15) is SIGKILL (or -9)
[16:44	<El1>	Is there anybody who knows on which packages the hardware drivers manager depends? Or where I can look this up?
[16:44	<bazhang>	gapagos: nay
[16:44	<Ntemis>	i am on hardy btw
[16:44]  * pimplife just unstalled 8.04 resolution stuck at 800x600 how do i fix it
[16:44	<Millertime_018>	photojim: i understand. ive only ever went from one os to the other once; 7.1 to 8.04
[16:44	<mattperry>	Millertime_018: I have surround enabled there
[16:44	<Creeture>	gapagos: Nope.
[16:44	<nith>	np
[16:44	<J-Unit>	crashanddie, its not if it doesnt respond necessarily
[16:44	<pimplife>	installed
=== nith is now known as Nith
[16:44	<Millertime_018>	so it may be best to upgrade just the same
[16:44	<PhotoJim>	Millertime_018: this machine originally had dapper drake on it and it's upgraded nicely from there (so far).
[16:44	<El1>	***pimplife: welcome to hardy heron and nvidia :P
[16:44	<Millertime_018>	i'm just giving what i know photojim
[16:44	<J-Unit>	crashanddie, its like im running a game that just doesnt show although its technically running but i dont c it
[16:44	<PhotoJim>	Millertime_018: np :)
[16:44]  * Scrounch is now away: off
[16:45	<Nigromante>	hello
[16:45	<bazhang>	pimplife: what have you tried
[16:45	<as2000>	is there a legacy driver for ati cards?
[16:45	<gapagos>	Creeture, thats something linux zealots should work on lol
[16:45	<bazhang>	!away >	Scrounch
[16:45	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, so the syntax would be kill -9 PID, you can get the process ID through ps (man ps), alternatively, you could use killall to bypass the PS step, and directly give the name of processes to kill
[16:45	<Dante123>	amenado I already have hardy installed on another pc....so I have a feel for it and I like it so far.  Would running the livecd basically pick up the non-integrated card and install properly or do you think I will have to go through all the hassles again?
[16:45	<yahya__>	mut80r, I would have done that, but this is a problem of my n00b friend, he wont know how to mount his HDD linux partition. Nothing to just add to boot option, like edit them on boot?
[16:45	<|neon|>	? ASUS Laptop with screen light sensor, everytime i boot i have to change the file ls_switch from 1 to 0 in order to gain brightness control, otherwise the screen is too dark to be usable, how can i make this permanent instead of having o edit the file evrytime i boot
[16:45	<Nigromante>	does anyone have gnome panel position problems with Ubuntu 8.4 (hardy)
[16:45	<Nigromante>	?
[16:45	<mut80r>	yahya__: I believe it mounts the system and displays it on the desktop anyway. couldn't hurt to try
[16:45	<OllieA>	I need to add a new screen res, how?
[16:45	<weaver>	hi. Ubuntu 8.04 won't install the bootloader during the installation, and manual bootloader install doesn't work :(
[16:46	<Wiredtape>	mut80r: will deleting hd1 partition cause grub (on hd0) not to work.. (ubuntu is on hd1) ..
[16:46	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: i dont know that i can help then. i know that ubuntu separates volume a lot; like the pc speakers can be on high while the output audio may be quite
[16:46	<yahya__>	ok, telling him that :) thanks fot the tip
[16:46	<mut80r>	Wiredtape: almost definitely
[16:46	<Ntemis>	please help i have installed koverartist but it dont show on the applications area, when i start it from command line it says : kbuildsycoca running...  and then this: kio (KMimeType): WARNING: KServiceType::offers : servicetype ThumbCreator not found  and this is the same for 8 lines!!!

[16:46	<OllieA>	bazhang: Hardy
[16:46	<Nigromante>	my panels change positions between logins
[16:46	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: i'm not so sure that i know then if enabling surround doesnt work. make sure and play with the leves
[16:47	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, for example: killall ./test or killall mozilla-firefox-bin
[16:47	<dassouki>	i upgraded to hardy yesterday, my sound isn't working I've tried the ! sound tutorial with no vain. lspci and ldconfig can see my card, nothing odd about dmesg. i've tried alsamixer and gstream-properties but nothing so far. can anyone help me please
[16:47	<mut80r>	Wiredtape: if you're removing grub or ubuntu, after removing it you will need to reinstate the other OS'es bootloader. if it's vista you can do this from recovery options on the vista dvd. otherwise go into recovery mode from an XP cd

[16:47	<errpast>	Nigromante, I have that happen sometimes too. Never figured it out.
[16:47	<J-Unit>	crashanddie, ps -e shows the number of all running processes?
[16:47	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: and try pluging in some earphones or something to find out if that works. it will be information that you can add
[16:47	<Wiredtape>	mut80r: you're very helpful, thanks ! :)

[16:48	<pimplife>	hardy
[16:48	<giry>	hi what its  this ?
[16:48	<mattperry>	Millertime_018: the strange thing is that after a fresh install, the first boot, I got the little "drum" sound to tell me to type my login etc...but after it booted into the desktop, all sound went silent...followed instructions on resetting and installing additional libs for pulseaudio and got sound from most apps to work, but still no system sound or shythmbox sound
[16:48	<schnootop>	if needed to, is there any way to rollback to 7.10 from 8.04 ?
[16:48	<crashanddie>	PhotoJim, I usually just ps -A

[16:50	<Leeuw>	doomskillet: just ask
[16:50	<bazhang>	!password | itaku
[16:50	<J-Unit>	crashanddie, so all i need to do is killall nameofrunningappiwanttokill ?
[16:50	<ubotu>	itaku: Forgot your password? Boot into recovery mode. What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[16:50	<eternal_p>	doomskilllet: just ask the question :)
[16:50	<mut80r>	bazhang: thanks.

[16:51	<mut80r>	Itaku: not much you can do.

[16:52	<N1NCHN41L5>	ANYONE can help with dula boot linux os????
[16:52	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: you can run 32 or 64 bit on a 64-bit processor, a 64-bit OS needs a little more love
[16:52	<Itaku>	there has to be a way so i can use sudo without enering a pass
[16:52	<doomskillet>	eternal_p, I've been running Ubuntu, neat, for over two years now - but I'm not elite :)
[16:52	<bazhang>	N1NCHN41L5: which distros and what is the exact issue
[16:52	<crashanddie>	N1NCHN41L5, don't ask if we can help, ask a concise question and people will help you
[16:52	<errpast>	JenFraggle, Looks like maybe a device change name.  Others had exact issue on upgrade. Try solution here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2485990

[16:52	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41L5: just because you log off and come back 10mins later, people don't forget you
[16:52	<crashanddie>	bazhang, you have to ask "which distro" ? Seriously ?
[16:52	<eternal_p>	use google to find your answers
[16:52	<crashanddie>	:P
[16:53	<Creeture>	Itaku: There is. man sudo

[16:53	<bazhang>	crashanddie: ubuntu and pclinux os? ;]
[16:53	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: then go nutz with 64-bit, your biggest issue will be flash

[16:53	<ENFEFI>	Hello!! Maybe someone could help me and explain something to me. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 and my laptop has a wireless card. When I type lspci -v this is what I got: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03). But now when I try to install the firmware I see there are two options: bcm43xx-fwcutter and b43-fwcutter. I don't know which one is the right choice to me :(
[16:53	<z0g|fewd>	nano /etc/apt/sources.list :>
[16:53	<crashanddie>	ubuntu, nice nick
[16:53	<doomskillet>	eternal_p Ah, flash. Flash is such a pain, isn't it?
[16:53	<mut80r>	ubuntu should be a registered name ..
[16:53	<bazhang>	cory_: in the installer?
=== indonesia is now known as indolinux
[16:53	<herghost>	I have a corrupt file installed since the hardy upgrade and now I can't perform any apt-get, synaptic or dpkg changes.  Can anyone help, please?
[16:54	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: oh ya
[16:54	<crashanddie>	ENFEFI, bcm43xx-fwcutter
[16:54	<bazhang>	crashanddie: that is the default for folks on the livecd iirc
[16:54	<cory_>	wheres that at im new at this
[16:54	<N1NCHN41L5>	ok i installed ubuntu gutsy gibbon to primarmy partition - now i wnat to install PCLinuxOS to extended partition what they called virtual i forget the one between extended and primary
[16:54	<crashanddie>	bazhang, oh, right... Still quite original :)
[16:54	<eternal_p>	sigh..
[16:54	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: So, are you saying that Flash will just be NFG on the amd64 distro of Ubuntu?
[16:54	<crashanddie>	N1NCHN41L5, you need to google about partitioning
[16:54	<Kathi>	i just installed ubuntu on my comp and it runs but after it loads and should show the login it goes to a blank screen.  i think it might be the resolution.  how do i fix it?
[16:54	<bazhang>	!lvm | N1NCHN41L5 read this first please
[16:54	<ubotu>	N1NCHN41L5 read this first please: Tips and tricks for RAID and LVM can be found on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RaidConfigurationHowto and http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
[16:54	<ENFEFI>	What is the difference between b43 and bcm43xx ???
[16:55	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: for flash, you need to load down the 32-bit firefox, there are scripts for this in Tips and Tricks on ubuntuforums
[16:55	<mut80r>	ENFEFI: b43 is newer and unstable.
[16:55	<z0g|fewd>	/care bout extended partitions :>
[16:55	<z0g|fewd>	all primairy here
[16:55	<errpast>	N1NCHN41L5, There are 4 primary partitions. 1 can support up to 64 (I think) extended partitions. What you are doing should work
[16:55	<Frozenball>	Why there's a limit?
[16:55	<kennethr>	help!  whenever I click my clock to see the calendar, gnome-panel freezes
[16:55	<errpast>	N1NCHN41L5, What do you mean "the one between?"
[16:55	<kennethr>	what do I do?
[16:55	<N1NCHN41L5>	ok iread MANY tutorials and had help in puppy linux but after the second install even without grub i get no load error 15
[16:55	<Itaku>	how do i make it so sudo doesnt ask for a password???
[16:55	<Frozenball>	Are there "extended extended partitions?"
[16:55	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: so, as long as I forget about 64-bit Firefox then Flash will work okay?
[16:56	<N1NCHN41L5>	there are 3 choices for partitions
[16:56	<N1NCHN41L5>	primary
[16:56	<crashanddie>	N1NCHN41L5, if I were you, I'd create one primary partition per OS, and cut their subpartitions into the extended ones

[17:00	<Nith>	dmsuperman: sorry but that's more of an XChat script thing. try googling but it isnt something the standard ubuntu power-user would know
[17:00	<crashanddie>	dmsuperman, not by default
[17:00	<tiax>	dmsuperman: well you could always type /lastlog dmsuperman or write a script to do it
[17:00	<Zaphod_42>	GoodJob, install audiacious. Then make a symlink "xmms" to the audiacous-binary ;)
[17:00	<J-Unit>	Nith, sry for being stupid
[17:00	<PieSquared>	Should /tmp be on the 'overflow' file system?

[17:02	<dassouki>	is there a way i can remove all my sound car information and reinstall sound from scratch ?
[17:02	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: so when yo uinstall your new OS, put /home on its own partitoin, so if you want to go 64-bit you don't need to backup
[17:02	<Nith>	Itaku: its easier to hit ALT+F2 then "gnome-terminal" but you could also navigate to /usr/bin then double click on "gnome-terminal"

[17:03	<lordofthepigs>	Sindacious, also try: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 --help to see what you can with the apache server
[17:03	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: I do frequent backups, anyway. The way I figure it, when an OS upgrade is free, I don't need to prematurely optimize it :D
[17:03	<su-hoens`rZ>	Kr0ntab: no, but i noticed taht that was gone from the file now
[17:03	<eternal_p>	rinaldi_ best to ask in #wine

[17:04	<crashanddie>	dmsuperman, highlight
[17:04	<Nith>	figuringout: try an fsck on it (make sure its not mounted)

[17:05	<su-hoens`rZ>	Kr0ntab and why did upgrading cause my etc/hosts file to get overwritten
[17:05	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: So, when everything starts to run smoothly on the 64-bit distro, I can just go ahead and upgrade. I doubt I'll notice any performance improvement on the 64-bit distro, anyway - at least, not enough to counter-balance the headaches I'm bound to encounter with the proprietary crap that we're still forced to deal with.

[17:08	<lordofthepigs>	Kr0ntab, will crontabs execute even if my user is not logged in?
[17:08	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: One more question, though: does the amd64 version run better on AMD processors than it does on Intel 64-bit processors that are compatible (i.e., the Core 2 series, not the Itaniums)?
[17:08	<herghost>	how do I remove a corrupt software installation if the corruption is stopping apt-get and dpkg from working?
[17:08	<Havnfun>	IndyGunFreak: Hang - will check
[17:08	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: i honestly don't know, I perfer Intel over AMD, that is all I can tell you
[17:08	<Kr0ntab>	lordofthepigs: yes... there's a cron daemon that runs as root... and executes it's schedule accordingly

[17:22	<cory_>	how do i do that if i cant get on the internet
[17:22	<KaduBRA>	I installed Ubuntu 2 times, one for Wubi into Windows and 1 from live live cd

[17:23	<Zacaa>	why is that?
[17:23	<KaduBRA>	error 15: file don't found (on the boot)
[17:23	<errpast>	Yan1, that's a wild guess..could be way off base. But I had similar issue with a sound card AFTER an upgrade.
[17:23	<Zacaa>	does anyone know ?
[17:23	<plik>	hypercity: oops, wrong way round    trailing / copies the contents , no trailing / copies the dir

[17:23	<amenado>	KaduBRA->	missing stage15 files in /boot/grub  and maybe device.map is not configured correctly
[17:23	<lordofthepigs>	Kr0ntab, one last thing, when I change the /etc/cron.d/mycron file, do I need to run anything for cron to take the modifications into account?
[17:23	<wal>	basically when I press a keyboard key my mice freezes until the keyboard is depressed

[17:28	<cory_>	firefox is the only 1 i got
[17:28	<_julian>	I just tried to install sun6-java-sdk with adept, which failed because it awaited some input on terminal which I couldn't do in adept, so I had to kill adept

[17:46	<szx0>	bazhang, purely linux
[17:46	<amenado>	szx0->	no, a server must be running those services so your netbooting client can acquire the needed info

[18:22	<jroes>	lol.  this is no fun :|
[18:22	<herbaliser>	can you help me
[18:22	<Marce_>	z0g, i've tried with both envy and .run from the nvidia website.
[18:22	<Encrypt3d>	ok thnx dude,i will
[18:22	<mindlord>	gor1 nothing at all, avg cou load is about 8%
[18:22	<wishie>	herbaliser: module for what ?
[18:22	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, it says I'm up to date
[18:22	<herbaliser>	iscsitarget module
[18:22	<quittt>	why my other partitions that are mounted do not appear on desktop???!??! I'm under XFCE
[18:23	<Shoops>	I just installed Ubuntu 8.04 (not a new user though), and it worked fine until I tried installing the proprietary drivers..... now I get a black screen upon reboot, and no option to login ): Can anyone help me? :D
[18:23	<bazhang>	Auctionedllama: what does lsb_release -a and uname -r say
[18:23	<amenado>	keycool1->	you have cisco aeronet, not sure if that uses wpasupplicant
[18:23	<mindlord>	_alf_ I'll go check.
[18:23	<g0th_>	void^: hmm I tried to use that but then truecrypt didn't compile
[18:23	<g0th_>	but I try again
[18:23	<bazhang>	Shoops: boot in recovery mode then fix
[18:23	<herbaliser>	i have 3 director debain include and kernel how do i compile this wishie?
[18:23	<NightBird>	I'm trying to boot from 8.04 cd(both kubuntu and ubuntu), and I'm getting dumped to busybox with the following messages "[75.298946] 8139cp 0000:08:02.0: This (id 10ec:8139 rev 10) is not an 8139C+ compatible chip" and "[75.298994] 8139cp 0000:08:02.0: Try the '8139too' driver instead."
[18:23	<juannicolas>	Hi, I have Hardy 8.04 server installed and Im getting a tty2: input overrun msg in the /var/log/auth.log - please help
[18:23	<mindlord>	_alf_, GL Desktop is not running
[18:23	<Shoops>	bazhang: does recovery mode give you a GUI or just the console?
[18:24	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: unfortunately I can't help ya further.... but if it isn't hardware issue.. the there's something up with the driver.  Which is odd because its a faily common card.  what can get ya into weirdness is the chipset/transceivers choice of the manufacturer.
[18:24	<Marce_>	z0g, i've tried with both envy and .run from the nvidia website.
[18:24	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, llama@Ubuntu-Main:~$ lsb_release -a

[18:24	<z0g>	uhuh
[18:24	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: ok, well of nuthin trahing the cpu then yeah, GPU might be getting trashed. btw, i so paranoid I use an infra-red thermometer on important machines :) i open case and allow to stabilise and shoot it at various bit lol
[18:24	<bazhang>	Shoops: low res gui
[18:24	<Shoops>	kk :]
[18:24	<herbaliser>	wishie or point me to a guide on the web how to do it.
[18:24	<z0g>	is the driver listed in the propiertairy driver config panel?
[18:24	<Shoops>	thanks
[18:24	<Shoops>	yes
[18:24	<OldSocks>	How do you import your bookmarks from Windows Firefox2 to Ubuntu Firefox3? Or where is the folder in Ubuntu that holds holds the bookmarks?
[18:24	<pyrak>	ok, i think i need to resore gnome to it's defaults
[18:24	<pyrak>	how do i do that
[18:24	<pyrak>	?
[18:24	<ruewan>	i wonder why they hide the torrent download all the way to the bottom
[18:24	<wishie>	herbaliser: does it come with a configure script ?
[18:24	<keycool1>	amenado: I don't see it on the supported list on the wpa supplicant page
[18:24	<bazhang>	Auctionedllama: a simple Hardy would have sufficed ;] and uname -r ?
[18:24	<amenado>	NightBird->	its faulting when it attempts to bring up your ethernet 8139 based card
[18:25	<pyrak>	i plugged my lappy into a projector system, and after rebooting my screen is all zoomed
[18:25	<mindlord>	gor1, that's a bit extreme, but I sympathize. I burned up 2 GPU's in my tower through poor heat management
[18:25	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: so in this case... you may want to file a bug report if you can for sure use the card in another software environment.  e.g. windows... ubuntu live cd... another distro.
[18:25	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: and on a hardware point, check your BIOS temps, after say 30 mins of desktop use
[18:25	<enfefi>	I need help with the time in Ubuntu 8.04. At boot time I got this error: 8254 Timer not connected to IO-ACPI and in Gnome the time is wrong. My machine is a Pavilion zx5369cl laptop
[18:25	<pyrak>	and i can't adjust the resolution to be above 800x600
[18:25	<dreamcoder>	should i use 64bit or 32bit?
[18:25	<_alf_>	mindlord: i think it's built into xorg. i don't have anything like that running either, and yet my alt-tab rotates windows in 3d
[18:25	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: nuthin is extreme if it allows u 365+ uptime :)
[18:25	<herbaliser>	wishie no
[18:25	<amenado>	keycool1->	then you proly have to hunt around what drivers supports your cisco aeronet..
[18:25	<NightBird>	amenado: okay, how do I set it to either try the 8139too driver, or(worst case), disable ethernet completely?
[18:25	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: how much ram
[18:25	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: but I would doublecheck that before hand.  boot from a live cd and see...
[18:25	<fiXXXerMet>	How reliable is a live update from 7.10 to 8.04?  Is it best to format and start clean?
[18:25	<g0th_>	hmm, bitchx was removed from ubuntu 8.04?
[18:25	<dreamcoder>	1gb
[18:25	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: ok, thanks. But it's very strange, because I could connect on this pc, which has the same card
[18:25	<ruewan>	someone told me 32
[18:25	<agnul>	uhm... yay for me! just moving the themes from my home folder to usr/share/themes did the trick
[18:25	<bazhang>	32 bit dreamcoder
[18:25	<lch_>	dreamcoder: when you ask? 32 bits ;-)
[18:25	<_alf_>	g0th_: yeah, it has security issues
[18:25	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, it says 2.6.24-16-generic
[18:25	<plik>	g0th_: irssi ftw :)
[18:25	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: yeah then its likely a card issue...
[18:25	<Marce_>	z0g, yes it is... it appears to be running... i can only get working with nv driver, with nvidia one xorg crashes by that reason :/
[18:25	<_alf_>	g0th_: yeah, irssi
[18:25	<Laser88>	OldSocks: it's somewhere here - ~/.mozilla/firefox
[18:25	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, thats the right kernel correcT?
[18:25	<bazhang>	Auctionedllama: then you are final! ;]
[18:26	<mindlord>	_alf_, I don't think upgrading from gutsy to hardy turned it on.
[18:26	<g0th_>	kk
[18:26	<dreamcoder>	i thought 64bit had speed increases though?
[18:26	<Al-Khouli>	guys, SOS, i am facing this damned error in the middle of upgrading to hardy: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[18:26	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: I'll try with another live-cd
[18:26	<z0g>	Marce_, it sounds weird :/
[18:26	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, yip, the day after I installed i had 300 megs of upgrades
[18:26	<z0g>	tried installing the driver using synaptic?
[18:26	<J-Unit>	fiXXXerMet, everything u sudo apt-got will remain other apps wont, thats all i can say but upgrading is better since u dont have to "restart ur life"
[18:26	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: also... try rebooting without the nic plugged in... and retry
[18:26	<amenado>	NightBird->	try to boot from the liveCD and see if it detects same chips, and see if you get same errors
[18:26	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: only if you dislike youtube ;]
[18:26	<keycool1>	amenado: I've been looking, can't seem to find, not sure I know where is best to look
[18:26	<NightBird>	amenado: I'm botting from the liveCD, and getting the same errors
[18:26	<Marce_>	z0g, nop, i'll do it
[18:26	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: trying to see if anything on the switch/router is locking it up.
[18:26	<dreamcoder>	i managed to get flash working in a 32bit browser on kubuntu 8.04
[18:26	<z0g>	:?
[18:26	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: nic plugged in?
[18:26	<z0g>	*:>
[18:26	<Marce_>	:D
[18:26	<amenado>	keycool1->	which cisco model do you have?
[18:26	<dreamcoder>	it would work the same on ubuntu am i right?
[18:26	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: what's that?
[18:26	<Marce_>	brb
[18:26	<z0g>	did the trick for me Marce_
[18:27	<_alf_>	mindlord: tell me this, if you go into system, preference, apperance, visualization and then select the "Extra" option. does it ask you to restart or anything?
[18:27	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: nic = network interface card...
[18:27	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: I meant flash and 64 bit have a bit of a hassle getting going
[18:27	<amenado>	NightBird->	cant do much then if your liveCD also detects same,  how about older 7.10 livecd ?
[18:27	<Marce_>	zog, but i wanted to have propertary drivers working :(
[18:27	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: as I said, I have a dual-boot with Windows, and it is working... :(
[18:27	<Juanfer>	FIREFOX and SYNAPTIC Not Connecting.... why this happens?
[18:27	<dreamcoder>	okie
[18:27	<NightBird>	amenado: those work fine.  is there no way to boot the livecd with that driver disabled?
[18:27	<amenado>	keycool1->	which cisco model do you have?  many aeronet versions and models
[18:27	<lch_>	dreamcoder: i use 64bits as base and have a 32 bit ubuntu in a chroot for the browser with plugins. butu using 32bits directly is easier :-)
[18:27	<Al-Khouli>	how to solve this error: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[18:27	<Al-Khouli>	??
[18:27	<keycool1>	amenado: I bet....how can I check?
[18:28	<amenado>	NightBird->	you have not installed 8.04 yet?
[18:28	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: ahh okay...
[18:28	<g0th>	hi
[18:28	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: another point is install fluxbox, that bypasses a lot of the gnome desktop crud,  simply sudo apt-get install fluxbox, at the GDM greeter, go to change session at bottom right, select fluuxbox, you right-click for the menu, most stuff in applications at top of list, just avoid using nautilus as a noob with fluxbox ;)   If no fluxbox probs then ur prooblem maybe gnomey-related
[18:28	<amenado>	keycool1->	labels on the device perhaps?
[18:28	<g0th>	(I now have irssi)
[18:28	<Laser88>	juanfer: anything else connecting?
[18:28	<plik>	g0th: welcome to the club, - enjoy  :)
[18:28	<pyrak>	i'm having problems with my video card.  i logged in as a different user, and no luck.  it was working fine until i plugged this machine into a projector.  help!
[18:28	<NightBird>	amenado: I tried to do an upgrade from 7.10, but it locked up my computer nearing the end, and it may have wiped out the driver my /home/ partition was on
[18:28	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: yeah im sorry mate.  i do need to step out though.  sorry i couldnt help ya out for now.
[18:28	<g0th>	so another issue: when I compile my kernel with make-kpkg binary-arch, I get this message:
[18:28	<g0th>	dpkg-deb: building package `linux-headers-2.6.24.3' in `../linux-headers-2.6.24.3_2.6.24.3-10.00.Custom_i386.deb'.
[18:28	<wishie>	herbaliser: depending on the structure, try something like... make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
[18:29	<g0th>	dpkg-deb: control directory has bad permissions 2755 (must be >=0755 and <=0775)
[18:29	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: ok, thanks for trying to help me :)
[18:29	<mindlord>	_alf_ no, but I've used compiz on this computer before without lockups or anything, I just turned it all off for speed. Only 1ghz cpu
[18:29	<g0th>	what directory do they mean?
[18:29	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: no sweat.
[18:29	<amenado>	NightBird->	it should not wipe out your /home  if you have it in separate partitions..try to boot from older 7.10 livecd?
[18:29	<keycool1>	amenado: its internal, and it doesn't seem to say on the bottom of the laptop either
[18:29	<jytd>	does hamachi work on ubuntu? Anybody tried this out?
[18:29	<_alf_>	mindlord: it'll make the gpu hot, upping the system temperature. i doubt it'll make the cpu hot
[18:30	<amenado>	keycool1->	cisco is a well known brand perhaps if you can visit your vendors web site to dig info?
[18:30	<herghost>	ompaul: thankyou, that link you found sorted my problem completely.  thanks for helping
[18:30	<Juanfer>	pointer DISSAPEARS when wake-up, but still working
[18:30	<_alf_>	mindlord: if its cpu overheating issues you can pretty much ignore everything i've told you
[18:30	<mindlord>	gor1, I'll try that. It hasn't locked up in about 45 minutes now.. It might be dirty power since I moved it.
[18:30	<Juanfer>	pointer DISSAPEARS when wake-up, but still working
[18:30	<Juanfer>	FIREFOX and SYNAPTIC Not Connecting.... why this happens?
[18:30	<plik>	g0th: hmm..  try find / -name "linux-headers-2.6.24.3_2.6.24.3-10.00.Custom_i386.deb"   , and use the parent dir
[18:30	<gor1>	ï»¿jytd: yeah i uses hamachi and ghamachi on 7.10, if that helps but only to test for a hour or two, i'd try  google ghamachi ubuntu
[18:30	<soop>	simple question ... how can i change the length of a gnome desktop panel?
[18:30	<Laser88>	how to answer juanfer? :-)
[18:30	<keycool1>	amenado: ok great, thanks for the help. also, should I assume I'm looking for a driver now, is that the issue?
[18:31	<bazhang>	Juanfer: try ping google
[18:31	<jytd>	gor1, Ok, and it's not in the repository, right?
[18:31	<Laser88>	Juanfer: does anything else connect?
[18:31	<lch_>	Juanfer: but the network is working otherwise?
[18:31	<amenado>	keycool1->	if its not waking up,, yeah driver issue, can you paste the results of your iwconfig ?
[18:31	<navetz>	can somebody please help me get a mail server set up?
[18:31	<enfefi>	I have the wrong time in Ubuntu 8.04. At boot time I got this error: Timer not connected to IO-ACPI

[18:33]  * mindlord seriously considers trying to reinstall from scratch
[18:33	<lch_>	Al-Khouli: was your system up to date before the upgrade?
[18:34	<Laser88>	Juanfer: stay here, so that we can help u
[18:34	<xyzpaw>	thanks guys bye
[18:34	<william__>	is it recomended to do the install over gutsy?
[18:34	<_alf_>	mindlord: have you tried sitting a console to see if you get a kernel panic?
[18:34	<dassouki>	amenado, why would i do that?
[18:34	<mindlord>	gor1 I moved the machine as a result of the lockups, trying to see if dirty power may have been the cause.
[18:34	<doug2266778822>	anyone burn dvds?
[18:34	<Al-Khouli>	lch_, i used to get this error before upgrading
[18:34	<hacx>	hello :-) doesn anybody know if it is safe to upgrade to Hardy Heron if i have Fluxbuntu7.10 ?
[18:34	<gor1>	ï»¿jytd: not sure if in apt, in fact i dont think it was back then now u mention it
[18:34	<tobmalf>	Without the right to defend yourself.. no.. there is few republicans in the world..
[18:34	<bazhang>	william__: this is linux; there is no recommended-->	just 20 opinions ;]
[18:34	<amenado>	dassouki->	so you dont affect the old one?yuo can install a new ubuntu on separate partitions
[18:34	<NightBird>	amenado: I've apparently tossed my old dvd, I'm burning a new copy now, I'll let you know when I've got the 7.10 livecd up
[18:34	<Al-Khouli>	lch_, but it's preventing me now from going on and i have unmet dependecies
[18:35	<william__>	lol
[18:35	<lch_>	Al-Khouli: you said you installed 32 bit packages in your 64 bits system... maybe revert those to 64 bit
[18:35	<amenado>	NightBird->	okay good luck
[18:35	<BSG75>	in 8.04, does evolution directly syn with google calendar? read/write both. Or do I need to use some sort of sync app in between
[18:35	<kbreit>	How can I tell 8.04 to detect my monitor?
[18:35	<soop>	william, just leave your /home partition in place and go ahead i figure, worst case scenario, you reinstall your apps
[18:35	<SeaPhor>	I have fresh installed my 8.04, how do i get it to use my separate /home partition?
[18:35	<g0th>	plik: that is /usr/src/ which is 0755 ? hmm
[18:35	<mindlord>	_alf_, no, but I've been working on a half dozen machines this morning, including my own... so everytime it happens it seems to be when I'm not looking. Except a few times when I was surfing the forums for lockups in hardy.
[18:35	<chazco>	Hi... whats the best option for MS Office compatibility (university uses it for everything, even work submissions). OpenOffice and SoftMaker Office dont render documents as Word does...
[18:35	<soop>	SeaPhor: did you mount that partition as /home?
[18:35	<Cpudan80>	SeaPhor: mount it as /home
[18:35	<amenado>	SeaPhor->	all partitions have to be mounted first before it can be used
[18:36	<_alf_>	mindlord: when you walk away, press ctrl+alt+f1 so if its the kernel flipping out you'll get some output
[18:36	<mindlord>	_alf_, will do.
[18:36	<lch_>	chazco: and? even word renders the same doc differently, depending on version and printer.. so what..

[18:51	<shigutso>	where is the Shared Folders icon in Ubuntu 8.04? I can't share a folder because I don't have permissions to do that...
[18:51	<amenado>	NightBird->	blacklist?
[18:51	<mark_>	blackirish->	that happened to me, I had to manually edit the file in /etc and change my virtual desktop size to match the resolution
[18:52	<NightBird>	amenado: could I set it to do that when booting from the live cd?
[18:52	<unzzi>	I just tried to start Hardy from CD I got console (BusyBox or something). What gives? It does that if I select 'install Ubuntu' or 'try without installing'.
[18:52	<swiftfoxer>	oh okay
[18:52	<noozz>	why does my hdtv not receive any signal after installing nvidia drivers??
[18:52	<swiftfoxer>	thanks amenado, lch_
=== aerio is now known as terrestre
[18:52	<BlackIrish>	which file? I can try that too!
[18:52	<mark_>	you can probably see the bars if you move the mouse to the top of the screen, and the desktp will scroll
[18:52	<rotw>	BlackIrish: then press Ctrl+Alt+F1, log in, install fluxbox with sudo apt-get install fluxbox, login at your normal loginscreen and choose "Fluxbox" as a session, then you should at least have a GUI
[18:52	<gnomefreak>	unzzi: sounds like a bad file or bad burn
[18:52	<xSnOoPyx>	Hey can anyone help me out? I installed ubuntu and I think that theres some setting file it asked me to redo when installing so now i have no sound. plus update manager doesnt owrk
[18:52	<NightBird>	amenado: because live boot, install from cd, and even check disk are doing the same thing
[18:52	<amenado>	NightBird->	/etc/default/linux-restricted-modules-common  look here
[18:52	<BlackIrish>	I'll try that now
[18:53	<jneves>	how do I request that all pt-PT translations in launchpad for a package to be deleted?
[18:53	<noozz>	why does my hdtv not receive any signal after installing nvidia drivers?
[18:53	<cygoku>	Can anyone please tell me where is the script folder ?!?!

[18:53	<xSnOoPyx>	Any help over here?
[18:53	<mark_>	can anyone answer a question about bitmap fonts?
[18:53	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: can you update via the terminal? sudo apt-get update try that
[18:53	<Musicalduck>	hey, could someone help? I've installed ubuntustudio, but can only boot up into command line and no GUI loads
[18:53	<xSnOoPyx>	right
[18:53	<xSnOoPyx>	hold on
[18:53	<uwo>	hi all. is there anything like automatix for hardy?
[18:53	<amenado>	NightBird->	if that still fails you, try the alternate cd
[18:53	<MedO42>	bebraw: open a console and type "java". If it works then some kind of jre is working.
[18:53	<emorris>	!ask | mark_
[18:53	<ubotu>	mark_: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[18:53	<NightBird>	amenado: yes, but how do I do it for the cd?
[18:53	<bazhang>	uwo sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[18:54	<noozz>	why does my hdtv not receive any signal after installing nvidia drivers?
[18:54	<krasher>	anyone can help me... i simply can't make this nvidia-glx-new work properly in my box... i simply can't select my optimal resolution!
[18:54	<bebraw>	MedO42, k. that works. there's probably something wrong in my app
[18:54	<terrestre>	uwo applications --->	add/remove?
[18:54	<MedO42>	bebraw: Don't know if you need to do anything else to run applets in Firefox, for example.
[18:54	<soop>	in case anyone ever needs to know how to setup a multimonitor taskbar
[18:54	<soop>	http://www.lloydleung.com/2006/10/14/gnome-multiple-monitor-taskbar-window-listing/
[18:54	<mark_>	does anyone know how a bitmap font with the .fon extension can be installed?
[18:54	<amenado>	NightBird->	you have an installed working linux right? not livecd..
[18:54	<Seven_Six_Two>	!ubotu kde4
[18:54	<ubotu>	KDE 4.0.3 is the latest major release of the K Desktop Environment. KDE 4.0.3 packages can be found at http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde-4.0.3.php - More information can be found at http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.0.3.php - Support in #kubuntu-kde4
[18:54	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: It just reads the package lists, it doesnt install anything.
[18:54	<NightBird>	amenado: no, not right now
[18:54	<just_bob>	_alf_  i have php-pear, i need php5-pear
[18:54	<polcany>	hi all
[18:55	<rotw>	xSnOoPyx: yes. that's the point.
[18:55	<just_bob>	_alf_  thank you
[18:55	<amenado>	NightBird->	may i suggest downloading the alternate cd 8.04 and try that
[18:55	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: then it is working; now try sudo apt-get upgrade or sudo apt-get install packagename
[18:55	<gnomefreak>	krasher: that seems to be a fairly common issue atleast on my 3 boxes i upgraded, i had to make a new X11.xorg file using nvidia-config i think it was
[18:55	<rotw>	mark_: cp foo.fon ~/.fonts/foo.fon
[18:55	<MedO42>	bebraw: Also, there is a free (non-sun) jre installed by default I think. Maybe you want to try uninstalling that.
[18:55	<Musicalduck>	hey, could someone help? I've installed ubuntustudio, but can only boot up into command line and no GUI loads
[18:55	<noozz>	why does my hdtv not receive any signal after installing nvidia drivers? somebody?
[18:55	<lotfi>	ciao
[18:55	<bazhang>	!it | lotfi
[18:55	<ubotu>	lotfi: Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[18:55	<bebraw>	MedO42, alright. thanks for the tips :)
[18:55	<rotw>	Musicalduck: is there #ubuntustudio?
[18:55	<rotw>	then ask there
[18:55	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: but what about my uh sound, how can i fix it?
[18:56	<lotfi>	ok
[18:56	<amenado>	noozz->	can you please only repeat every 10 minutes or so, if someone knows , they will assist instead of repeating every two minutes
[18:56	<mark_>	rotw I put it there and ran rebooted, but it still does not show
[18:56	<_alf_>	just_bob: i think php-pear is fine for php5: apt-cache search php5 | grep pear
[18:56	<shigutso>	where is the Shared Folders icon in Ubuntu 8.04? I can't share a folder because I don't have permissions to do that...
[18:56	<gnomefreak>	Musicalduck: make sure the desktop package is intalled, but you might have better luck in #ubuntustudio or #ubuntu-studio (cant remember what one it is)
[18:56	<bastones>	Hello. I am trying to install Ubuntu from the CD I received a few days ago, and it begins to load with the orange bar and it gets to just about the middle and freezes. I tried addong noapic from F6 but that didn't fix it either. Anyone got any solutions, as I really want to get away from Microsoft Windows.
[18:56	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: not sure; you need to provide more info
[18:56	<Seven_Six_Two>	Musicalduck, did you install the rt kernel?
[18:56	<rotw>	mark_: /usr/share/fonts ?
[18:56	<NightBird>	amenado: I'm downloading now... 3 hours remaining
[18:56	<bazhang>	bastones: try the alternate cd
[18:56	<DB42>	no #ubuntu+1 ? :) what about 8.10 :)
[18:56	<keycool1>	amenado: would my card be the aironet 350 mini-pci wireless lan client adapter or the aironet 350 wireless lan client adapter?
[18:56	<polcany>	oki
[18:57	<uwo>	tnx all, was hoping for someting like automatix to still exits - not because of codecs, but skype, realplayer, google earth... all in one place
[18:57	<mark_>	rotw Yes, there too, I ran fc-cache and rebooted after that as well. worked with a ttf but not fon
[18:57	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: Idk really whats wrong, i was on gutsy and  i updated to hardy and now it just doesnt work.
[18:57	<MedO42>	ï»¿Is the arch/x86-part of the kernel source tree used for both 32- and 64-bit?
[18:57	<bastones>	bazhang: sorry, didn't understand you there. What alternate CD?
[18:57	<yao_ziyuan>	continue my last question:
[18:57	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: well with that amount of info not sure what to say
[18:57	<amenado>	keycool1->	hard for me to tell, its not infront of me...read what your laptop vendor says about your model
[18:57	<Gokee2>	noozz, Whats your xorg log say?
[18:57	<yao_ziyuan>	if i happen to run a virus,
[18:57	<just_bob>	_alf_ now i just need the other 3...
[18:57	<_alf_>	just_bob: apt-cache showpkg php-pear  <-- shows it depends on php5
[18:57	<bazhang>	!alternate | bastones
[18:57	<ubotu>	bastones: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/ubuntu-8.04-alternate-i386.iso.torrent
[18:57	<rotw>	mark_: hum. try and google it, ya never know, someone might've had the same problem. if not, look for a converter
[18:57	<_alf_>	just_bob i dunno about the others. if they are pear scripts use the pear you just installed to get them
[18:57	<noozz>	Gokee2: dont know what that is
[18:58	<yao_ziyuan>	which spawns two processes that restore each other when i kill either one in ksysguard,
[18:58	<yao_ziyuan>	and which adds startup items in ~/.kde/Autostart
[18:58	<mark_>	rotw, thank you. google taught me about the folders. I will look for a converter
[18:58	<bazhang>	yao_ziyuan: get clamav or avast linux version if that really worries you
[18:58	<yao_ziyuan>	does that mean my current normal user account is ruined?
[18:58	<Gokee2>	noob13, Hmm SO you see bootup right?  Its just when x start (right before the login screen) it blanks?
[18:58	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: i think it said something about boot/grub
[18:58	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: some kind of folder like that i dont remember. that may have been the problem.
[18:58	<swiftfoxer>	excuse me, but does anyone know how I can enable flash in swiftfox? or did I mess up the install and I have to reinstall it somehow?
[18:59	<Seveas>	yao_ziyuan, no
[18:59	<noozz>	exatcly
[18:59	<noozz>	im running @ 1360x768 if that helps
[18:59	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: sorry drawing a blank here
[18:59	<just_bob>	_alf_ the others are php5-mcal php5-domxml php5-xslt
[18:59	<hansin>	Does anyone thing there would be a problem if I did a minimal CLI install from the 8.04 beta CD, and apt-get updated from there?  Or should I really download the offcial 8.04 release CD and go from there?  I'd rather avoid wasting the bandwith and CD if I could, but if there is a problem installing from the 8.04 beta and upgrading I would.  Agian, I am only looking for a minimal CLI install, so it is much more basic that the full install
[18:59	<yao_ziyuan>	i think i should create a backup normal user account
[18:59	<xSnOoPyx>	damnit, anyone else have problems with sound after installing?
[18:59	<xSnOoPyx>	=(
[18:59	<yao_ziyuan>	in case my current user account get ruined
[18:59	<Musicalduck>	#ubuntustudio is seems to be pretty quiet. how am i meant to install the desktop package? someone recommend i try sudo apt-get install gnome, but i get an error message - gnome depends: gnome-desktop-environment (=1:2.20.2.2. but is not going to be installed
[18:59	<Gokee2>	noozz*
[18:59	<keycool1>	amenado: ok great thanks for the patience, I know I don't know my way around that well. It looks like its the mini PCI card. I have the link for the driver, but it only offers my windows 2000 and win xp options
[19:00	<yao_ziyuan>	imagine this:
[19:00	<bazhang>	hansin if you know the packages you want you can add them as you wish-->may want to add a gui though ;]
[19:00	<yao_ziyuan>	your only normal user account has malicious startup items (in ~/.kde/Autostart),
[19:00	<cygoku>	Can anyone please tell me where is the script folder ?!?!
[19:00	<_alf_>	just_bob: what happens if you type: pear install mcal
[19:00	<yao_ziyuan>	so you can't log into gnome or kde
[19:00	<cygoku>	Can anyone please tell me where is the script folder located ?!?!

More I am wondering if I really need to offcial release CD, or can I reuse my 8.04 beta CD instead and upgrade via apt-get or apptitude instead?  I figure I can, just not sure if there some major change that apt-get or aptitude would miss.  I am pretty sure not, but

[19:08	<Gokee2>	noozz, If you can see that you can login and loog at your xorg log with less /var/log/Xorg.0.log might tell you something like if your computer is giving your moniter a higher resalution then your moniter supports.  I need to take off now, you can msg Gokee2_Office if you want I will be there in about 30 min.

[19:23	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, hm i tried myself in the open dialog and failed, you are correct it doesn't work that way. I guess this functionality is not supported by gnome yet. What I do regulaly is to sftp to a site through nautilus and open a file in text editor and works fine
[19:23	<Exteris>	pixelmonkey, i do have a lot of setgrabkeysstate, perhaps that's because of my window manager

[19:26	<cellofellow>	hi there. I've a weird problem. I can't log in with GDM anymore. (Using Gutsy) I get very weird errors about GTK being run setuid and, well, let me see if I can pastebin.
[19:26	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I just switched to the nv driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and I'm getting better performance.  I think there is some regression in the nvidia driver + X.org + possibly GNOME stuff like cairo.
[19:26	<daemon3>	8 hours to complete the upgrade!!!!????!!!??
[19:26	<Piteco>	yes i now
[19:26	<gerardoj>	cvasilak: thanks anyway

[19:26	<Piteco>	but does not work
[19:26	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I don't get 3D with the nv driver, but I can live without that for now.

[19:26	<gnomefreak>	bigtimer121: without seeing it i cant tell you exactly what is going to happen
[19:26	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, maybe because they have restructured the IO layer in gnome with the introduction of gio and this feature was too late to implement but i agree with you its a handy feature for some people
[19:26	<cgentry72>	bazhang, 2.6.24-16-generic
[19:26	<Pelo>	djlenoir, ok  reboot the comp, when you get to the boot menu ,  select the correct menu option and type E to edit ,  find the root line and change it to root (hd0,0) ,    then type enter to accept and type b to boot ,  you'll hve to chagne it manaly in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file once you have booted,  changes from the menu are not permanent

[19:27	<LuitvD>	hou5ton: there's more hassle with java and flash and stuff, so if you don't want issues, the regular i386 would be the safe choice
[19:27	<Exteris>	pixelmonkey, is it much faster? how did you measure performance? because i might switch back too then

[19:28	<Piteco>	I'm new with ubuntu
[19:28	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris but basically, with the nvidia driver, Evolution uses about 50% CPU during normal usage (e.g., selecting/reading e-mails) and with nv, it's back down to 0-5% where it should be.
[19:28	<Exteris>	nl2br, i have the same card, the restricted drivers work fine

[19:42	<uba>	hi 2 all
[19:42	<gnomefreak>	Daremonai: did you run apt-get update after commenting them out?
[19:42	<biabia>	I figured out my problem with my install, all my hard drive device names were changed so they were wrong in my fstab, i just had to manually mount them and edit the fstab
[19:42	<pixelmonkey>	supersako sorry for delay, regarding VMWare, yea, I installed it
[19:42	<RequinB4>	Does anyone know where i can find a list of laptops where bug #136469 is solved out of the box on hardy?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/136469
[19:42	<Daremonai>	yes gnomefreak, i only get those results nothing else
[19:42	<pixelmonkey>	supersako at first I tried 116, and that didn't work because it mis-detected the version of VMWare I was running

[19:43	<pixelmonkey>	supersako I ended up modifying the version using something like a VMWARE_VER environmental variable, don't remember entirely.
[19:43	<danbhfive>	Cygoku: please don't be insulted, but maybe you aren't understanding correctly.  You don't format drives, you format partitions
[19:43	<themad>	I did this, but then i want to save it, it writes to me: Cannot change permissions of folder "FOLDER NAME"

[19:43	<djlenoir>	Pelo, Yes the files referenced in menu.lst are in the /boot folder. Go ahead and reboot then?
[19:43	<danbhfive>	Cygoku: so, you need to create a partition
[19:43	<swiftfoxer>	themad: go to terminal and  sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf

[19:46	<dfeuer>	I've got a real tricky question, and I don't know where to look for an answer, so here I am.  OpenOffice Writer substitutes a font for Tahoma, because I don't have Tahoma installed.  I really like whatever it's substituting, but I don't know what it's substituting.  OpenOffice has no font substitutions configured, so it's using something external, but I don't know what, or how to track down which font this might be.
[19:46	<nl2br>	z0g, ok i'll give a try
[19:46	<distortion>	how do i extract a .r00 .r01

[20:24	<CJS3141>	sylvan: I'm no expert either with Grub, but the menu.lst file is simple enough you might be able to figure it out like I did when I had trouble with booting. Or there is a program called "startupmanager" in the repos that may help--I've never used it but it claims to be able to configure Grub.
[20:24	<sylvan>	CJS3141: Cheers I'll give it a go
[20:24	<Pelo>	SeaPhor, ok , do this boot the live cd,  delete your "current" /home folder ,  then make a new one , leave it empty,  then put this line i the fstab   /dev/sda4 /home     ext3    defaults        0       2   and reboot , that should work
[20:24	<Beererde>	what can i do if nvidia.ko ist GONE after a reboot??
[20:24	<Ashfire908>	jburd: you could check you iptables with "sudo iptables -L". that will list the iptables firewall settings

I never used it, so i replaced it with the most recent version of Freespire. I did not like freespire, and am just goiong to let it sit there on my disk for a while. But after I installed it (or more correctly, after I moved too many files over from old partition and filled this one.) i ran out of disk space. I deleted my trash (had

If I go into terminal and log in as another user (not graphically) it says I have 10 gigs left. Gparted also says that.

[21:29	<Sir_Fawnpug>	absnt, well I'm not very familiar with setting up vnc on linux, but make sure you're not running that session as root

[21:34	<Zelta>	unzzi: Well, it should be the same, but try doing shutdown only, nonetheless.  Shutting down and restarting are different in the eyes of the BIOS
[21:34	<QuadF>	its the monitor not being detected

[21:34	<Zelta>	zvacet: No, his issue is not a space limitation one
[21:34	<matthias_>	TimMatrix: ok, than the driver is probably the wrong one, this might soubd funny to you but grab an copy of the windows driver from your computer companies homepage only and placer it on your dektop also ...
[21:34	<Sir_Fawnpug>	QuadF, there's an awesome tool out there whose name escapes me, but if it comes down to having to manually configure xorg, it's helpful for doing all of the metrics

[21:36	<GoodJob>	Some_Person, that's not caused by a memory leak

[21:36	<xubean>	is that error I'm getting because of a server, if it is then, I can keep trying different servers! :)
[21:36	<Some_Person>	GoodJob: then what is it caused by?
[21:36	<unzzi>	Zelta: I had another problem while booting from Hardy CD and I think it's somehow connected to this. I get BusyBox prompt no matter what I chose in the boot menus. I got help for that in the forums but there are several people with this SATA problem and same boot problem which they didn't get help for yet.
[21:36	<CJS3141>	uyann: :D I never realized that.
[21:36	<Zelta>	xubean, how are you upgrading?  through the upgrade manager?
[21:36	<bagelong>	CJS3141:  ABSOLUTELY - not
[21:36	<xubean>	zelta: yes...
[21:37	<flyback>	and ubuntu's whatever ass backwards locking they did to the network device I can't even set it manually
[21:37	<qijie>	what?
[21:37	<Assid>	QuadF: you have an nvidia.. try the nvidia-config
[21:37	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, Try running firefox in safe mode and see if it still happens
[21:37	<GoodJob>	Some_Person, it's caused by the application when it encounters an unindentified behaviour
[21:37	<QuadF>	i did Assid
[21:37	<Some_Person>	Jordan_U: will try
[21:37	<xubean>	zelta: actually the weird thing is, ubuntu doesn't even show that I need an upgrade right now, i have to do a force upgrade "gksu update-manager -d"
[21:37	<chris_probl>	QuadF: do you have nvidia-settings installed? (System->Administration->Nvidia-Settings)
[21:37	<LexLuthor>	hi!! i want to know if i may install a ubuntu in a windows xp partition?
[21:37	<Zelta>	xubean: Don't do that
[21:37	<GoodJob>	Some_Person, it's caused by the application when it encounters an unindentified action
[21:37	<Some_Person>	GoodJob: So using excessive memory is caused by that?

[21:38	<zvacet>	xubean Sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade to be sure you are up-to-date
[21:38	<Zelta>	unzzi: That's odd... the NTFS3g driver should be working.  It could be a hardware problem with the SATA drive
[21:38	<TimMatrix>	Matthais: downloading updates to sources

[21:38	<matthias_>	TimMatrix:  that is okey let it update itself ...
[21:38	<xubean>	zvacet: I did that, and it tells me I am up-to-date... even though I'm still on gutsy... it tells me 0 upgrades!

[21:38	<CJS3141>	bagelong: OK, you probably need to reboot then--I'll hang around a little while longer, but try to get back right away as I've got to get going here soon.
[21:38	<LexLuthor>	Hello!!! some budy can help me?
[21:39	<chris_probl>	Assid: it doesnt for his. I have his too. Nvidia settings does moniter config though, and that is what he needs.

[21:39	<chris_probl>	TisMatrix : w8 whats ur problem
[21:39	<SuperLag>	LexLuthor: and no, you cannot install Ubuntu in an Windows XP partition
[21:39	<Sir_Fawnpug>	ivan_, sudo bash

[21:40	<TimMatrix>	chris_probl: the problem is that I can't get the wireless working on my wife's laptop, running on Live Ubuntu 8.04.  I needed to make sure that it all works, including wireless capability, before I wipe off her Vista OS and install Ubuntu 8.04.

[21:41	<Some_Person>	GoodJob: this is just about decreasing memory usage, which shouldn't apply when it's actually leaking. It increases memory usage on every click. something is wrong

[21:54	<MrObvious>	chris_probl: Don't you mean F1?
[21:54	<SirronTM>	Jordan_U: Firefox won't share with anything. Nor will BMPx.

[21:55	<MrObvious>	pisse: Ouch that sucks.
[21:55	<Jordan_U>	MrObvious, You should generally not use "sh <somescript>" and instead simply do enter the path to the script ( ./scriptname if it's in the current directory ) so that the correct shell will be used as it may expect to be run in bash or even python but you are forcing it to be run in /bin/dash despite it's #! line
[21:55	<os2mac>	then I don't have any ideas...
[21:55	<zvacet>	xubean : it is easy.Just follow guide

[21:57	<shawnr34>	Any problems with the new Ubuntu? safe to install? any broken packages?
[21:57	<MrObvious>	smilevil: Well that's how. Oh yeah you need to change the mirrors to say Hardy instead of Gutsy. There is a wiki page somewhere about that.

[22:03	<PleegWat>	hi. I'm having trouble getting the nvidia binary graphics drivers to work. I'm using envyng, and I used to be able to set it up successfully using envy on 7.04 and 7.10
[22:03	<kangkong>	what are the parameter i should put in /etc/fstab to autmount my /dev/sdb1 as read and write in hardy? ( /dev/sdb1 is ext3 )
[22:03	<pmcclelland>	anyone else having slight issues playing hd video (.mkv). I have a 8800 GT and 4GB of ram so it can definitely handle the 1080p. I just get these horizontal lines through the picture periodically. Not anything major just annoying.
[22:03	<Jordan_U>	bruenig, That was uncalled for ( even if it's true )
[22:03	<bruenig>	PleegWat: don't use envy
[22:04	<red22>	chris_probl: and the forums i find recommend to do what my xorg has right now... can't believe there is still no mouse config app that does this.

[22:04	<chris_probl>	QuadF: I am sorry to say that is the crappiest looking Xorg.conf I have ever seen. Your monitor is working though?
[22:04	<thedonvaughn>	bruenig: not always ture.  but in the case for ubuntu, where it is geared towards a "Windows alternative".  yes you willl have that.  not so much ina community such as debian tho.

[22:05	<daemon3>	Are the servers still really busy?  It's taking me a while to upgrade.
[22:05	<bruenig>	PleegWat: the only xorg.conf setup you have is to change the Driver to nvidia, so where it says "vesa" or "nv" edit that to say nvidia
[22:05	<red22>	kade2: you need the altinstall cd

[22:09	<QuadF>	still shows "Extension GLX missing"
[22:09	<omar>	any idea whats goin on?
[22:09	<chris_probl>	lifesf nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[22:09	<Jack_Sparrow>	bruenig, I can agree but if they put it in our repos they must feel it deserves the tag of supported.
[22:09	<Steven1>	Ok I'm back guys.
[22:09	<Assid>	QuadF:  you using nidia-glx-new?
[22:09	<Flare183>	omar: the servers are really loaded right now so you might want to try later
[22:09	<chris_probl>	QuadF do nvidia-settings. Does it still have all the options?
[22:09	<Warod>	Any idea what stuff might stop me from changing content of a file under /sys/devices/platform/ ?
[22:09	<tomd123>	torrent is the way to get cd's now
[22:09	<Steven1>	Jack_Sparrow: I tried to follow the howto guide for GRUB but it's giving me errors.
[22:09	<QuadF>	you do not appear to be using the nvidia xdriver..
[22:09	<TimMatrix>	Loosid: slow Ubuntu, as it is running off the CD.  I think I'd better install it WITHIN Windows, to see if all's OK.  When I got the wireless working, and know how it's done, then I will be confidence to format the hard drive (destroy Vista, ha ha ha) and install Ubuntu and then do the procedure as learnt from yourselves.
[22:09	<Flare183>	tomd123: that is correct
[22:09	<loosid>	tomd123: unless you have Comcast :)
[22:09	<omar>	oh ok, thought there was something wrong with my network
[22:10	<veneboy>	Arky44: no. I used bc43- and the drivers without nsdis---
[22:10	<bruenig>	Jack_Sparrow: I thought the only qualification for being in the repo was being 3 months out of date?
[22:10	<chris_probl>	QuadF: ok..... here we go again
[22:10	<tomd123>	loosid: won't help if the server is lagging
[22:10	<chris_probl>	QuadF: sudo nvidia-xconfig
[22:10	<Jack_Sparrow>	bruenig, that is out of line
[22:10	<dan>	Hey all, I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu 8.04 (64-bit) on my computer. Everything works save for the sound on my system. I changed the device to my soundcard, a Soundblaster Live! 24 bit, but it still had no playback. I then selected every track/channel and unmuted/raised the volume on each one. I turned the IEC958 switch on too. I also went into alsamixer, selected my card and tried to see if there were any channels still muted and there were
[22:10	<dan>	not.
[22:10	<loosid>	tomd123: too true, too true
[22:10	<QuadF>	ok
[22:10	<Steven1>	Jack_Sparrow: I've tried several times to use the find command from within the grub command line and it's not working.
[22:10	<darrint>	Is there a definative source for good info on the nvidia + compiz = black windows bug?
[22:10	<QuadF>	new config written
[22:10	<tomd123>	loosid: I found out the hard way :)
[22:10	<chris_probl>	QuadF: then sudo nvidia-glx-config
[22:10	<kevin4381>	ï»¿I need some help: ï»¿firefox window position is forgotten between uses. Ubuntu 8.04
[22:10	<chris_probl>	QuadF: then sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
[22:10	<loosid>	TimMatrix2: Sounds good to me.  I've done the same and had good results :)
[22:10	<shane2peru>	Steven1, what is the problem, grub not booting?
[22:10	<veneboy>	Arky44: i'm talking right know, connected through my wireless... but i cannot list the available networks... have to put everything manually.
[22:10	<loosid>	TimMatrix2: I hope that works for you.
[22:11	<kevin4381>	why does VLC fullscreen only work on one of my two monitors? (fullscreen video jumps to primary monitor)
[22:11	<hayhay>	Lost my video - at login screen that is without GUI - is there command I can run to reset my video back to previous state? (on another desktop here)
[22:11	<bruenig>	Jack_Sparrow: 6 months?
[22:11	<kevin4381>	only in VLC
[22:11	<QuadF>	command not found
[22:11	<veneboy>	Arky44: If I go with my laptop somewhere else... i won't know what networks are available...
[22:11	<Steven1>	shane2peru: I'm trying to restore grub from the LiveCD after installing Windows. So they will dual boot.
[22:11	<veneboy>	:(
[22:11	<chris_probl>	lifesf: hows the copying going? you got a pastebin link yet?
[22:11	<Jack_Sparrow>	bruenig, Please stop.. you are being rude
[22:11	<shane2peru>	ok, open a terminal

[22:12	<Jack_Sparrow>	bruenig, Not at all funny
[22:12	<loosid>	TimMatrix2: Also, since you have an Atheros wifi, you might look into installing the madwifi-tools package.  That works for most Atheros cards, but (as far as I know) not all of them.
[22:12	<shane2peru>	Steven1, give me the results of sudo fdisk -l in a pastebin

[22:26	<MrObvious>	shane2peru: Lol. I had it 3 months because I wanted to learn how it works and after installing Hardy I am glad it isn't my primary OS anymore.
[22:26	<mysticdarkhack>	hey all
[22:26	<anemptygun>	three cheers for 8.04!
[22:26	<SlugO>	Firefox is behaving strangely. Does anyone know why it only adds .com suffix to words that I type into location bar instead of the usual Google's "I'm feeling lucky" type of thing
[22:26	<oddalot>	hip hip
[22:26	<MrObvious>	SlugO: Because it's a beta browser?
[22:26	<anemptygun>	hooray
[22:26	<oddalot>	hip hip
[22:26	<josh04_>	testola: the xorg.conf file can be edited in the same way, it just uses autoconfiguration for most of it, so the file in /etc/X11 is a skeleton file
[22:26	<anemptygun>	hooray
[22:26	<shane2peru>	MrObvious, yeah, I have heard a lot of bad., worse yet they are going to cut XP, that will be cutting their own throat.
[22:26	<Shpook>	Only reason I would like a native solution is because with ndiswrapper, I still had to bind the network to wlan0 every time I booted up. I would prefer it all to be automatic.
[22:26	<mysticdarkhack>	anyone know a way to fix firefox 3 to play my web asx stream
[22:26]  * oddalot takes a double shot
[22:26	<anemptygun>	lol
[22:26	<oddalot>	hip hip
[22:26	<mysticdarkhack>	it keep using movie player
[22:27	<anemptygun>	HOORAY
[22:27	<oddalot>	w00t
[22:27	<VseSlav>	MrObvious Plz advise me irc server, where I can meet girl)
[22:27	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[22:27	<MrObvious>	Shpook: You can have ndiswrapper run on bootup.
[22:27	<Steven1>	SlugO: I have a problem in Ubuntu with Firefox where it wont let me save bookmarks and all my buttons are gone. So your problem aint much.
[22:27	<MrObvious>	VseSlav: I don't know one sorry.
[22:27	<Felix>	could someone help me ? , in gusty i was able to change screen resolution , select a monitor and configure my video card, but in hardy i can only change resolution , is there a graphical way like in 7.10 to select a monitor and video card for hardy ?
[22:27	<mysticdarkhack>	to us mozilla-mplayer plugin
[22:27	<VseSlav>	MrObvious :(
[22:27	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, we need to mount your hda4 like this:  sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu
[22:27	<Dave123_road>	VseSlav, wrong server
[22:27	<VseSlav>	Dave123_road Ok
[22:27	<Gun_Smoke>	VseSlav: #debian
[22:27	<testola>	josh04_: So if i remove the contents of xorg.conf it will try and reconfigure?
[22:27	<MrObvious>	Shpook: I don't remember how but it's possible.
[22:27	<Steven1>	Felix: You probably don't have the restricted drivers set up anymore. Mine was the same way.
[22:28	<patzz>	irc://irc.quakenet.org/ Channel is #CA_Priv
[22:28	<Shpook>	MrObvious: That's how I had it before, and ndiswrapper would load but network-manager would never find the network. I had to use iwconfig to bind the network to the interface
[22:28	<shane2peru>	Steven1, then:  sudo mount /dev/hdb4 /mnt/ubuntu
[22:28	<MrObvious>	Shpook: It's in /etc/modules IIRC and it's just like modprobe ndiswrapper on bootup automatically.
[22:28	<Shpook>	MrObvious: It was pretty annoying. :-)
[22:28	<shane2peru>	Steven1, are ya with me?
[22:28	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Unrecognized command.
[22:28	<FooAtari>	hey all.  I seem to have a strange problem.  As od as this may sound, since upgrading to 8.04 I have been unable to login several times.
[22:28	<VseSlav>	irc://irc.quakenet.org/
[22:28	<MrObvious>	Shpook: Hmm I never had that when I used ndiswrapper on Gutsy for a while.
[22:28	<xyzpaw>	could anyone tell me what program i have to run to upgrade to 8.04?
[22:28	<FooAtari>	I had to login as root, reset my password for my regular account (which is set to something very straighforward) and then I can login.  but twice my machine has rebooted on its own and I have been unable to login with the password used previosuly.  Anyone got any ideas what would cause thuis?

[22:29	<Steven1>	disregard
[22:29	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, type:  quite
[22:29	<shane2peru>	Steven1, no I mean : quit
[22:29	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: I think it might be permissions in your home directory in one of the . files.
[22:29	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: That's just a guess though.
[22:29	<Shpook>	MrObvious: Well, I just installed Heron on a clean slate, so maybe I'll give it another go with ndiswrapper. I don't want to spend forever fighting with it.
[22:29	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yeah just figured that out. Opened a new terminal and ran the command no replies.
[22:29	<tdjacr|away>	Can someone review http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=768908 for me?
[22:29	<acoustyk>	Gnome-do won't launch firefox or pidgin
[22:29	<xyzpaw>	could anyone tell me what program i have to run to upgrade to 8.04?
[22:29	<acoustyk>	not sure why not
[22:29	<Cr7>	rv identify maxcr7
[22:29	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, did you run the mount command too?
[22:29	<Felix>	but my point is , how could I configure my monitor or videocard in gnome ? i was able in 7.10 but that option is gone in 8.04
[22:30	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: sudo apt-get install distro-upgrade
[22:30	<loosid>	xyzpaw: sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
[22:30	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yes.
[22:30	<FooAtari>	hmm, ok MrObvious ill see what I can see.  I noticed that onece it was starting klibido that caused the reboot, wonder if there is a permissions issue there.  I reinstalled not long ago so see if that helps
[22:30	<red22>	who was it helping me with mouse/xorg 15 mins ago pls?
[22:30	<nickrud>	xyzpaw, better is   sudo do-release-upgrade
[22:30	<jepler>	Felix: System >	Preferences >	Screen Resolution ?
[22:30	<testola>	Felix: what is your problem w the gfx?
[22:30	<xyzpaw>	thnx'
[22:30	<acoustyk>	is gnome-do working straight out of the repositories for everyone else?
[22:31	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, now type this:  sudo cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst.bak
[22:31	<Steven1>	shane2peru: So now Windows will be in the boot load list?
[22:31	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: I would just create a new user and then just move all your documents to the new user's home directory and set stuff up again.
[22:31	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ahh, wait
[22:31	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: Then you can delete the old one and use your old user/pass.
[22:31	<Steven1>	shane2peru: 'cp: cannot stat `/boot/grub/menu.lst': No such file or directory'
[22:31	<Felix>	yup i can set resolution there but in 7.10 i was able to change resolution and configure my video card too, how do i configure video card in hardy ?
[22:31	<lastelement0>	hey all, i try to change the icons for AWN yet they always go to the default once i restart. where should i go to change this so they are permanent

[22:32	<tomd123>	does anyone know if there is any easy to use iso to usb script for ubuntu?
[22:32	<red22>	no wonder ppl are afraid of xorg.conf... i changed mouse settings and i had to log in via text term and fix stuff just to get it back to how it was..
[22:32	<shane2peru>	Steven1, that should be:  sudo cp /mnt/ubuntu/boot/grub/menu.lst /mnt/ubuntu/boot/grub/menu.lst.bak
[22:32	<Felix>	of course it is possible to do that  in console mode but is there a graphical way ?
[22:32	<TimMatrix>	I am still here on TimMatrix, TimMatrix2 (also me) is offline due to booting up and installing Ubuntu.
[22:32	<Jack_Sparrow>	tomd123, sure one sec
[22:32	<Jack_Sparrow>	tomd123, Make an iso on usb bootable http://jak-linux.org/tmp/iso2usb.sh
[22:32	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Ok no problems that time.
[22:32	<shane2peru>	Steven1, now we are almost there now type:  sudo gedit /mnt/ubuntu/boot/grub/menu.lst

[22:33	<MrObvious>	pr4bh: I doubt anyone will know how to fix that. You just don't have a working CD drive? You could take the drive out and put it in a regular computer and use a laptop to IDE converter.

[22:35	<alabamahit>	Can someone please tell me if 8.04 is stable and ready to be used by a (newbie) Or should i stay with 7.10.
[22:35	<MrObvious>	alabamahit: I think I would give it a while. You really aren't gaining much honestly.
[22:35	<Steven1>	shane2peru: http://pastebin.com/d78bad134
[22:35	<xyzpaw>	can you play windows videogames on wine?
[22:35	<pr4bh>	i was thinking if there was any way of modifying grub so that it gives the option 'run' the bootable vista files on the other partition
[22:35	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: Some.
[22:35	<nickrud>	alabamahit, no reason not to upgrade that I've seen, but waiting a couple weeks (in case some really bad bug crops up) won't hurt
[22:35	<Jack_Sparrow>	alabamahit, wait a week and watch for problems.. if this is your everyday setup
[22:35	<testola>	restarting...
[22:35	<FooAtari>	alabamahit, its a step up from 7.10, better hardware support and is LTS so will be supported until 2011 I think it is
[22:35	<xyzpaw>	steven1: why not all?
[22:36	<MrObvious>	alabamahit: I say that just because it's just we need a couple weeks to get things up and running better.
[22:36	<FooAtari>	but nickrud has a point
[22:36	<SeaPhor>	xyzpaw, i play everything ie tried but i use Cedega
[22:36	<alabamahit>	Cool thanks Everyone :)
[22:36	<lee_>	ok how do i correct this? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ and why hasnt ubuntu corrected this age old issue?
[22:36	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: Capabilities of wine are limited. I haven't been able to get it to work with DirectX games.
[22:36	<Bidget>	so is hardy out yet? if so how do I update to it?
[22:36	<Anza>	Hi, I have one question. Since I upgraded to the latest Ubuntu version, in most of my mp3 files would appear at the end: (invalid encoding)  and those that have that are wrote in other language or using accents, it's terrible to have to fix it manually on each one, how can I do to make this recognize them??????????
[22:36	<Jack_Sparrow>	alabamahit, support will inpove over the next week as well
[22:36	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, great, now when you reboot, it will default to Linux, if you want Windows you will need to scroll down to the bottom.
[22:36	<andril>	hello allagain
[22:36	<EDM>	anyone know why I can't have more than 2 gnome workspaces?
[22:36	<alabamahit>	But i am missing something i cant find the 7.10 download...all i see is the 8.04
[22:36	<Jordan_U>	pr4bh, If you can create a bootable iso of the Vista Install CD you could boot from that using GRUB ( or some *NIX bootloader at least, I did it before with knoppix a while back )
[22:36	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: Check the wine site for a list of compatible stuff.
[22:36	<verve>	anyone having nvidia problems with hardy?
[22:37	<loosid>	Bigget: sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
[22:37	<shane2peru>	Steven1, why do you have the development branch of hardy?

[22:37	<xyzpaw>	so cedega is better than wine?
[22:37	<nickrud>	alabamahit, oh, if you haven't installed yet, just go straight to 8.04
[22:37	<EDM>	wine is better
[22:37	<lee_>	No I just get the natoriouse can't get http issues
[22:37	<MrObvious>	Bidget: Change Gutsy to Hardy in /etc/apt/sources.list and do sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade and it should work.
[22:37	<Fogel1497>	i'm having trouble mounting an ntfs drive. the drive is /dev/sdd5 and when I type "sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdd5 /media/Network -o force" it tells me theres an input/output problem

[22:37	<Gman99999>	Hey my firewall isnt working properly, Im using firestarter, its been saying that it can't start etc until I changed what device it was using from the ethernet to the wireless card Im using now in my laptop why doesn't it auto shift to the next device?

[22:38	<EDM>	I can't add them with the workspace switcher preferences
[22:38	<Jordan_U>	loosid, running sudo aptitude dist-upgrade alone will NOT upgrade between releases
[22:38	<shane2peru>	Steven1, you can close the file and reboot, if everything is up-to-date with your Ubuntu, then you have the official, just in the titles it will always read like that unless you change it.
[22:38	<Gman99999>	anyone know the firestarter firewall very well?
[22:38	<Bidget>	so MrObvious I just change every line in that list file that says gutsy to hardy?
[22:38	<loosid>	Jordan_U: Yeah, I failed to mention the sources change.  MrObvious picked that up though, so thanks to him :D
[22:38	<pr4bh>	Jordan_U: thanks mate, i can make iso out of the files, can u help me a little bit more?
[22:38	<nickrud>	LainIwakura, somwhere in /etc/fonts there's a file that controls allowing bitmapped fonts (turned off by default). Not on ubuntu at the moment so I can't tell you the exact one
[22:38	<xyzpaw>	is it true that you dont need any antispyware, antimalware or a firewall in linux?

[22:39	<Jordan_U>	pr4bh,  I can try :)
[22:39	<MrObvious>	Bidget: Hardy not hardy. It is case sensitive.
[22:39	<Techdeck``>	what media player (for mp3, not videos) do you recommend guys? I want something nice looking
[22:39	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, I'll be back in a bit, reboot, and you should be back too. :)
[22:39	<Steven1>	shane2peru: It should be. And I guess I'll restart so my resolution will catch up with me. Also I got a lot of Windows tweaking to do.
[22:39	<LainIwakura>	nickrud: I used "sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config" to enable bitmapped fonts. Shouldn't that work? Thanks.

Since I upgraded to the latest Ubuntu version, in most of my mp3 files would appear at the end: (invalid encoding)  and those that have that are wrote in other language or using accents, it's terrible to have to fix it manually on each one, how can I do to make this recognize them??????????

[22:59	<dencoman>	Is there someone in this room who also had an issue getting the D-link wireless DKT-410 connection to work in version 8.04?
[22:59	<akoculu>	doorknob60: here: /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[22:59	<lee_>	no no freezes just failures to get the need updates
[22:59	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, they would be under /dev/sd* now.
[22:59	<CJS3141>	amazen720: Sorry, can't help you with that. Maybe someone else can...

[23:00	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: still, only one of them is displayed there as sd...
[23:00	<arbrandes>	Zelta, Yeah, that would probably be faster, but I wonder why it takes so long from the shutdown menu?
[23:00	<kindofabuzz>	anyone else get this problem?  I'm online, but ever site i visit i get a failed to Connect in firefox, i hit try again and it will load, sometimes i have to hit try again several times

[23:00	<CJS3141>	amazen720: I assume you can open it fine in Vista? Do all of your other CDs open OK in ubuntu?

[23:02	<djlenoir>	Because of a GRUB issue (Error 22) on my system, I want to wipe the hard drives and reload Ubuntu. What is the best way to wipe the drives to prepare them for a fresh install of 8.04?
[23:03	<Steven1>	Some_Person: I just said I was.
[23:03	<arbrandes>	Some_Person, depending on the site, I've had it crash the whole GDM

[23:04	<j2daosh>	i need to know how i can put multiple email addresses for an email
[23:04	<j2daosh>	but i cant find a good tutorial on it
[23:04	<arbrandes>	Some_Person, yeah, it's safe to say that FF3 was a somewhat dubious move.
[23:04	<lee_>	eh ok down loading the  alternate cd....it will upgrade one way or the other lol
[23:04	<mildner>	I like to restore google earth because it starts without data
[23:04	<Platyhelminth>	whatch http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64582/ . I can't run 8.04 (32bit version) on my computer(with 64bit cpu) . But 7.10 worked fine ...
[23:04	<lee_>	or it will break lol
[23:05	<Some_Person>	It's strange though. I used the official FF3 beta 5 on gutsy without issues.
[23:05	<porta-Farhan>	what i can't figure out is why i start a init/d service and then I have to stop it then run it as -d in root to get it to work

[23:05	<j2daosh>	anyone?
[23:06	<amazen720>	CJS3141: my ubuntu 8.04 installation disk works
[23:06	<FooAtari>	i use antivir mkquist or did toy mean from within linux?
[23:06	<ferris_>	djlenoir, start the reinstallation process, and then manually edit the partitions. Delete them and restart your computer. It will break the partitions and then you are free to restart the process... but only if you have a single OS, or want to have a single os on the drive....
[23:06	<Platyhelminth>	I didn't try but i am afraid to try

[23:07	<ChrisNZ411>	can anyone point me to the website or group for connecting a ADSL modem to ubuntu?
[23:07	<Some_Person>	porta-Farhan: to get a "real" installation on a partition, boot the cd
[23:07	<DjViper->	porta-Farhan: booting and installing will install it 'permanently', wubi is like a demo
[23:07	<genii>	mayakuza: Follow instead the instructions here http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide
[23:07	<porta-Farhan>	ah
[23:07	<Justin125>	I'm currently running Ubuntu via Wubi but now I'm satisfied with Ubuntu I want to do a full install with a seperate parition ect. Do I have to do a full fresh install?
[23:07	<porta-Farhan>	yeah
[23:07	<porta-Farhan>	you do
[23:08	<CJS3141>	amazen720: Did you mention what it was you burned to disk in Vista? I didn't catch that... was it data/sound/video or what?
[23:08	<ferris_>	djlenoir,  good luck.
[23:08	<raindog>	j2daosh: Multiple recipients or multiple email accounts in an email client?
[23:08	<Bidget>	hey has anyone else recently upgraded to hardy?
[23:08	<Some_Person>	porta-Farhan: not entirely, Wubi just installs to a file on your windows partition and boots that
[23:08	<Some_Person>	porta-Farhan: in my opinion, it doesn't work very well

[23:18	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is not frozen.... I was thinking the same things..... I am not sure why it is slow... but you will want new sources.list file
[23:18	<william__>	Y-Town: i like and use them both :)

[23:20	<ferris_>	Bidget, I transferred the sites for the sources.list... but that was from the alternative disc... you may not need to worry about it at all... my laptop was an internet upgrade.... so I am not sure why it kept a better list
[23:20	<bagelong>	josh04: if you are on and can help me again I'll surely love you for ever.  In a platonic way of course
[23:20	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx
[23:21	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[23:21	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, this bug was probably exposed because they chose to move all PATA stuff into the scsci driver.
[23:21	<qbert>	unop: im on ubuntu :)
[23:21	<adaminla>	just downloaded 8.04. How do I check integrity of same?
[23:21	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: yes, the drive itself is visible in /dev/ as sdc, but no partitions are there, just as described there.  What would be the correct package to set that bug to?
[23:21	<raindog>	SeaPhor: right click the icon, does it show an option to mount/unmount?
[23:21	<djlenoir>	ferris, I am using Live at the moment, is there a way I can prepare the hdds through Live?
[23:21	<CJS3141>	unop: why not gksudo? qbert wants to run it as root.
[23:21	<Bidget>	ferris_, I see... well, if I have problems with it after I upgrade then I'll see about fixing them I guess. for now I'll just let it upgrade
[23:21	<kindofabuzz>	i keep getting "failed to connect".  so i hit "try again" and it will connect.  sometimes i have to hit try again several times.  anyone know what the problem could be?  i assume it's the wireless
[23:21	<Wolf23>	bruenig:  the channel is on invite? :(
[23:21	<amazen720>	CJS3141: give me a second, I'm burning another disk with magicISO after RAR the files. I have to go in closet to get some old disk, I usual use I Ipod to transfer files
[23:21	<SeaPhor>	raindog, Unmount option
[23:21	<unop>	qbert, CJS3141 never mind me, i didn't read the question right :)
[23:21	<krash3x>	I didnt install the 32bit libs I was just wondering if I need them for anythign
[23:21	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: or should I go over to #ubuntu-devel with that?
[23:21	<Owner>	Hey, I just finished Installing Ubuntu Hardy Via Wubi Installer.
[23:21	<ferris_>	djlenoir, did you finish the writing before rebooting/
[23:22	<bigtimer121>	some_person: same errors again
[23:22	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is a good idea to do that.... it may work fine for you
[23:22	<bigtimer121>	:(
[23:22	<raindog>	SeaPhor: Hmm.  I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you.  Sorry.  Hopefully, one of the more knowledgeable members in here can give you a solution.  Good luck.
[23:22	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: ok, lets try reinstalling and uninstalling it
[23:22	<djlenoir>	ferris, I could not finish the writing because my only option was to click Next and it told me I had not set up the partition to install Ubuntu to.
[23:22	<CygnusX1>	Greetings.  Just installed 8.04 on a laptop with mobility x700.  ATI restricted driver installed, yet, fglrxinfo still shows mesa.
[23:22	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: sudo apt-get --reinstall install nvidia glx
[23:22	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, not sure about the package, but I'd bet it is a kernel problem.  And if it IS really a kernel problem, it might take a while to get solved, especially if the Ubuntu guys have to wait for upstream.
[23:22	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: then sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx
[23:23	<SeaPhor>	raindog, Thanks for trying, and sorry, i did this a month ago with 7.10 and had no probs
[23:23	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if I were you, I'd search the linux kernel mailing list.
[23:23	<Owner>	Hey, I just finished Installing Ubuntu Hardy Via Wubi Installer, I loaded into it logged into my account and rebooted the computer, it rebooted and then i rebooted one last time, now when i start up Ubuntu it takes me into a "BusyBox" Command Line right before the login screen, now i cant login? What do I do? I need help!
[23:23	<towlie>	is anyone else here really disappointed with hardy heron
[23:23	<qbert>	unop: CJS3141 , thanks yall
[23:23	<noel__>	how can i get this lib (libdbus-glib-1.so.2) i need it for cairo-dock 1.5.5.2?
[23:23	<Dekkard>	towlie,  not yet
[23:23	<CJS3141>	qbert: no problem, cheers :)
[23:23	<Cew27>	hey can anyone help me here its not so much a problem as a query but when i mute my sound i can still hear it a little bit
[23:23	<raindog>	SeaPhor: I may be in for the same issue when I update to 8.04 as well.
[23:23	<towlie>	Dekkard, ive got a few problems that bug the crap out of me
[23:24	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[23:24	<Dekkard>	my first clean ubuntu instal since feisty
[23:24	<krash3x>	nope this was the first time I used ubuntu since 5.xx
[23:24	<towlie>	Dekkard, problems specific to hardy
[23:24	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if the problem is already solved in the newer kernels, than it is a matter of getting the Ubuntu devs to include the patch.  OR, you could do it yourself.
[23:24	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: the LKML seems to have one entry at least on this, without an answer
[23:24	<Dekkard>	like?
[23:24	<ferris_>	djlenoir, go ahead and create the partition, click the check box to format and then once it is finished writing the partitions restart the computer (hard reset)
[23:24	<SeaPhor>	raindog, well i didnt update, did fresh install to try to fix the wireless issue i've had for nearly 5 months
[23:24	<Bidget>	UH OH
[23:24	<ferris_>	you could also get a boot disk and kill the partitions as well
[23:24	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, ugh, no answer? bad news
[23:24	<Bidget>	I was updating to hardy and it failed :(
[23:25	<InfernoX222>	Hello all, I dont mean to bother anyone but i am having some major issues (major for a newb that is...) anyone have a few moments to help?
[23:25	<djlenoir>	ferris, Ok I will do that then.
[23:25	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: my personal interest in this is just as far as my gf in concerned (her PC), I don't have those issues here on my gentoo machine :-)
[23:25	<ChrisNZ411>	You still there spiderfire??
[23:25	<krash3x>	what kind of issues
[23:25	<Xbehave>	i had a preexisting vista partition on my drive but grub hasnt picked it up, how do i manually add vista?
[23:25	<Scunizi>	How do I find out which version of java I have installed?
[23:25	<Dekkard>	towlie,  whats buggin ya?
[23:25	<amazen720>	CJS3141: I found a old CD I burned using XP, to put LINKSYS drivers on it, and it mounted fine
[23:25	<ferris_>	Xbehave..... are you sure you still have it?
[23:25	<Bidget>	I got a whole bunch of errors while updating to hardy, and they were all "failed to fetch http://(blahblahblah) connection failed"
[23:26	<CJS3141>	InfernoX222: Just ask your question, and wait patiently to see if someone can answer it :)
[23:26	<krash3x>	do we need to install the 32 lib on the nvidia driver with 64 bit
[23:26	<Bidget>	and if it didnt say connection failed, it said connection timed out
[23:26	<InfernoX222>	well i got a DLink DWA-643 that i cant get to work with madwifi or even turn on... I also cant seem to get into a non X server mode to update my nvidia drivers
[23:26	<Xbehave>	yes i just mounted the partition
[23:26	<amazen720>	CJS3141: then you're right it's Vista
[23:26	<UnNaturalHigh>	does anyone here know how I would install just hpijs on ubuntu server?
[23:26	<Dekkard>	brb
[23:26	<Xbehave>	full of windows goodness/badness
[23:26	<bigtimer121>	Some_Person: same errors again
[23:26	<Bidget>	anyone...?
[23:26	<mng51971>	better to upgrade on a fresh clean install of ubuntu
[23:26	<Jordan_U>	Bidget, Try the automatic "best server" widget
[23:26	<Bidget>	?
[23:26	<ferris_>	Xbehave..... you will need to edit the menu.lst file
[23:26	<mng51971>	then you get no errors
[23:26	<Justin125>	Can someone just tell me if the % drag bar partition option in 8.04 install will be fine for a vista dual boot?
[23:26	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: ok, try "sudo mkdir /usr/lib32" then "sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx"
[23:26	<ferris_>	but I am not sure how to do that
[23:26	<amazen720>	CJS3141: them Microsoft Bastards!!!!!
[23:27	<Jordan_U>	Bidget, System ->	Administration ->	Software Sources ->	Mirror ->	Other ->	Choose best
[23:27	<InfernoX222>	justin125 i am running that way it works fine for me
[23:27	<Bidget>	k
[23:27	<Xbehave>	i no haw to edit menu.lst but no idea what to add to grub for it
[23:27	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, hehehe, I see.  Well, my relatively uninformed opinion is that it is probably a kernel issue, related to the move to the SCSI subsystem for PATA drives.  And if I were you, in this case I'd try to either use an older kernel, or try to recompile the current one turning off this PATA/SATA thing.
[23:27	<SeaPhor>	raindog, hey, before i shutdown and installed 8.04 I copied my fstab to a USB flash drive, would it be safe to just copy and paste that one line into the new fstab? wouldn't use the same UUID?
[23:27	<Xbehave>	!windows
[23:27	<ubotu>	For discussion and help with Microsoft Windows, please visit ##windows. See http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+bug/1 http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm and /msg ubotu equivalents
[23:27	<Bidget>	Jordan_U, I don't see a mirror tab in there anywhere
[23:27	<amazen720>	CJS3141: their sound be a fix for this soon, right?
[23:27	<Owner>	Hey, I just finished Installing Ubuntu Hardy Via Wubi Installer, I loaded into it logged into my account and rebooted the computer, it rebooted and then i rebooted one last time, now when i start up Ubuntu it takes me into a "BusyBox" Command Line right before the login screen, now i cant login? What do I do? I need help!
[23:27	<acke_n>	anyone done a ps3 upgrade to 8.04`? any issues?
[23:27	<Jordan_U>	Bidget, Sorry, it's "Download from"
[23:27	<bigtimer121>	some_person: mkdir: cannot create directory `/usr/lib32': File exists
[23:27	<CJS3141>	amazen720: Interesting, yes maybe it's a vista issue. You may have to post/search the ubuntuforums.org to see if there is any info that will help you.
[23:28	<Bidget>	Jordan_U, oh ok
[23:28	<noel__>	how can i get this lib (libdbus-glib-1.so.2) i need it for cairo-dock 1.5.5.2?
[23:28	<Bidget>	Jordan_U, alright I got it, I'll give the update another try and we'll see what happens this time :)
[23:28	<fred101>	hello, does anyone here know how to get xubuntu 8.04 working on a via EPIA-SP board? It crashes on boot, the caps-lock light doesn't illuminate when I press it.  I can boot to single user mode, but thats useless.
[23:28	<amazen720>	CJS3141: will do
[23:28	<ferris_>	Xbehave.... I think I can give you mine to take a look at
[23:28	<tseug>	i've upgraded to Hardy, a fresh install.  now how do i delete my old version (it's taking up space)?
[23:28	<raindog>	SeaPhor: To tell you the truth, I'm unsure.  At least you can use the old fstab as a reference and compare to the new one.  Of course, make backup of the new fstab, but perhaps then you try to edit/add the line from the old copy.
[23:29	<devtrash>	tseug, there should be no old install
[23:29	<unop>	noel__, try installing the libdbus-glib-1-2 package.  sudo aptitude install libdbus-glib-1-2
[23:29	<macabro22>	I am trying to update my distribution and I got a message saying update manager found an unresolvable error and I should file a bug against it and attach a log file from /var/log/dist-upgrade. Can someone help me out filing the bug?
[23:29	<Xbehave>	ferris_:  if you have vista installed i could probably decifer it, could you send it over plz? pastebin?
[23:29	<tseug>	devtrash, but i can switch between my old desktop and the new one
[23:29	<kane77>	I'm planning to get more RAM, where does it save stuff when I'm hibernating? will I need bigger swap?
[23:29	<ffm>	tseug, is it on a separate partition?
[23:29	<ffm>	tseug, delete it with gparted, but be careful.
[23:29	<tseug>	ffm, i think so.  i only want one
[23:29	<macabro22>	I am not sure whether it has already been posted
[23:29	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: ok, try "sudo cat /dev/null >	/usr/lib32/libGL.so.1" then "sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx"
[23:29	<tseug>	ffm how do i use gparted
[23:30	<Kovecses>	!version
[23:30	<ubotu>	To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type Â« lsb_release -a Â» in a !shell
[23:30	<ferris_>	Xbehave, I have Vista, http://pastebin.com/m2e4b542a
[23:30	<devtrash>	!livecd
[23:30	<Justin125>	how can I delete my wubi install so I can fresh install a real one?
[23:30	<ubotu>	The Ubuntu Desktop CD is a "LiveCD" which can be run without altering existing files on your harddrive. Especially useful for testing your hardware's compatibility, it also includes an install option.
[23:30	<acke_n>	is this chat availible online somewhere?
[23:30	<ffm>	tseug, "sudo aptitude install gparted; gksu gparted" in the terminal.
=== acke_n is now known as acke
[23:30	<Jordan_U>	tseug, The only thing you might have of your 'old system' would be cached packages and your previous kernels, to get rid of the cached packages run "sudo apt-get clean"
[23:30	<bigtimer121>	Some_Person: permission denied
[23:30	<noel__>	unop, i  have it already installed
[23:30	<Hawkeye-X>	I'm sure this question has been asked already but here ya go: I am trying to upgrade from 7.10 to 8.04, and right now it's freezing at distribution upgrade - "setting new software channels" - calculating the changes (it has gone gray and has been like that for a while) - anyone know if this is a normal issue or unusual issue?
[23:30	<ffm>	acke_n, It is publicly logged, yes. See the channel topic.
[23:30	<bigtimer121>	Some_Person: i am the admin also
[23:30	<InfernoX222>	If anyone knows how to vonfigures a DLink DWA-643 on 8.04 with madwifi (its an ExpressCard) or how to get into a non X Server mode to update graphic drivers please PM me
[23:31	<acke>	ffm thanks
[23:31	<ffm>	acke, why?
[23:31	<Kovecses>	Hawkeye-X, i did the upgrade earlier today without issue
[23:31	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, If you are trying to create a blank file then "sudo touch ..."
[23:31	<Hawkeye-X>	Kovecses: what did you do differently?
[23:31	<unop>	noel__, ok, you probably need to reinstall it then, because thats the package that contains that file.  sudo apt-get install --reinstall libdbus-glib-1-2
[23:31	<bagelong>	matthias:  I saw you helping someone earlier with a wireless problem. Care to help me with my issue?
[23:32	<Kovecses>	Hawkeye-X, my guess is nothing i just clicked update
[23:32	<acke>	ffm its in interesting example of what happends on dist upgrades
[23:32	<Xbehave>	thx ferris_.do you have 2 vista installs? i think i get wats going on, infact i sort of rember something like that from a previous install
[23:32	<matthias>	bagelong:  sure, shoot ...
[23:32	<acke>	ffm im about doing one at my company aswell.. :D
[23:32	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: ok, try "sudo ls >	/usr/lib32/libGL.so.1" then "sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx"
[23:32	<HoNgOuRu>	how can I set my 5.1 surround using ubuntu gutsy??

[23:32	<bagelong>	matthias:  I can't seem to get my broadcom minipc card and driver linked up
[23:32	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, Remember that sudo is running the single program as root, not the shell, so file redirection is still done as your user
[23:32	<ffm>	acke, ok...
[23:32	<HoNgOuRu>	how can I set my 5.1 surround using ubuntu gutsy??

[23:33	<ferris_>	Xbehave, no one is my Operating system, the other is an recovery partition, but it needs to have the bootable mount
[23:33	<matthias>	bagelong:  what version are you running _
[23:33	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, That won't work either...
[23:33	<bagelong>	matthias:  Hardy
[23:33	<acke>	ffm its development tools at a big mobile phone company...

[23:33	<matthias>	bagelong:  what wireless card are you using _
[23:33	<terrestre>	do you think its a good idea install ubuntu and kubuntu in the same partition or its better separated?
[23:33	<Hawkeye-X>	i'm still at upgrade - it says "setting new software channels" and the bar shows below as "calculating the changes" greyed out.

[23:38	<Kovecses>	acke, then why do it?

[23:38	<bagelong>	matthias:  all ubuntu documents suggest the bcmwl5
[23:38	<SeaPhor>	is the UUID the same no mater what?
[23:38	<InfernoX222>	when running the 'sudo modprobe pciehp pciehp_force=1' command shouldn't there be an output of some sort not just skipping to the next line?
[23:39	<matthias>	DjViper-:  you probably need to install ndiswrapper and install the windows driver, at least that worked for me ...
[23:39	<terrestre>	i hate ufw lol
[23:39	<Gerinych>	help setup internet on hardy
[23:39	<ferris_>	osmosis: is this a home server? ... have you made ANY changes to the hardware, os, or installed new packages?

[23:39	<bigtimer121>	Some_person & Jordan_U: thank you so much
[23:39	<androver>	Byan: what does "sensors" return?
[23:39	<matthias>	bagelong: go dells support page and with your service tag look up and download the driver for your service tag and we go from there ...
[23:39	<osmosis>	ferris_: I switched from 32 bit fiesty, and did a clean install to be on 64 bit hardy
[23:39	<Jordan_U>	bigtimer121, np
[23:40	<mEck0>	Hi! how can I increase the batterytime of my laptop in ubuntu? I got about 2h 40min, while in windows xp and vista I got about 5h 25min, which is a huge difference... Now I even see that the battery monitor seem to not work as good as before (gnome).
[23:40	<Kasio>	anyone?
[23:40	<Byan>	androver: "No sensors found!"
[23:40	<shane2peru>	Kasio, ohh, did you change username or password?
[23:40	<terrestre>	Jordan_U, nope lol
[23:40	<Kasio>	nope
[23:40	<x1250>	Damn, my first wireless problem. Something very strange has happend. dmesg says:

[23:40	<loosid>	DjViper, matthias: Sorry to interject.  I've had the same problem and had to use the Win2k driver vs. the WinXP.  Not sure if that's your issue though.
[23:40	<Kasio>	i have correct user and password
[23:40	<aphan9>	ooh hi everyone, i just installed hardy heron, and i'm having trouble connecting to wireless
[23:40	<Kasio>	no error
[23:40	<x1250>	Whats that kill switch all about? How do I turn it off?
[23:40	<androver>	Byan: do you remember what modules sensors-detect installed in gutsy?  are they still listed in /etc/modules?
[23:40	<aphan9>	can anyone help me?
[23:40	<loosid>	DjViper, matthias: after that I've had no issues
[23:40	<Kasio>	it just logs in, you hear sound and then back to login screen
[23:40	<shane2peru>	Kasio, ok, did you upgrade or fresh install?
[23:40	<Kasio>	upgrade...
[23:41	<Kasio>	i tried fresh but after dll 3 times and burning i kept getting errors
[23:41	<shane2peru>	Kasio, it doesn't tell you anything like wrong username or anything?
[23:41	<raw>	is it possible to switch from ubuntu to kubuntu under a VMware image?
[23:41	<Kasio>	nope
[23:41	<matthias>	DjViper-: the ndiswrapper is to handle the windows drivers that exists it is a work around to get going ...
[23:41	<Gerinych>	Kovecses: i have bcm4318
[23:41	<Kasio>	user and pwd are correct
[23:41	<Jordan_U>	Kasio, Try logging into a failsafe gnome session
[23:41	<shane2peru>	Kasio, hmm, that isn't good.
[23:41	<InfernoX222>	ï»¿when running the 'sudo modprobe pciehp pciehp_force=1' command shouldn't there be an output of some sort not just skipping to the next line?
[23:41	<ferris_>	osmosis: ok, i am not familiar with all of the distros, so i have to ask do you have a 64 system? Intel or AMD? Did you install a intel or amd version of hardy?
[23:41	<tomd123>	kasio, did you try booting in safe mode?
[23:41	<shane2peru>	Kasio, there ya go try Jordan_U's suggestion
[23:41	<matthias>	Broadcom does not share their source code so ndiswrapper is needed to get going ...
[23:41	<al_>	ciao a tutti
[23:41	<Kasio>	and then what lol
[23:42	<osmosis>	ferris_: yes, i have a 64 bit system
[23:42	<Byan>	androver: fiesty* and I did a fresh install and I looked in my backed up /etc
[23:42	<Kasio>	do i end up at command line?
[23:42	<osmosis>	ferris_: if you arent familiar, thanks anyway.
[23:42	<djlenoir>	ferris, Ubuntu is loading now. Hopefully this will clear up the GRUB error 22 when booting. :)
[23:42	<shane2peru>	Kasio, no it should be a working gui
[23:42	<Kovecses>	Gerinych, is that a wired or wireless nic card?
[23:42	<shane2peru>	Kasio, gnome desktop

[23:42	<ubotu>	Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie!
[23:42	<Jordan_U>	Kasio, No, you should just end up with gnome with an ugly theme and none of the session startup programs started :)
[23:42	<matthias>	as lossid says use the windows xp driver extract the files and use the .inf file to install in in ubuntu and it worked for me ...
[23:42	<ferris_>	osmosis: np... wish i could have helped out more
[23:42	<Kasio>	and if that works? lol

[23:43	<Byan>	androver: uhm, let me see
[23:43	<aphan9>	i cant connect
[23:43	<matthias>	DjViper-:  following me ?
[23:43	<Jordan_U>	Kasio, My guess is that it is compiz causing the crash ( possibly any 3D application )
[23:43	<shane2peru>	Kasio, you probably will need to disable somethings you have starting up in gnome, perhaps they aren't working or setup correctly.
[23:43	<Kovecses>	david_-_-, depends...what games
[23:43	<william__>	david_-_-:  any sort of virtualization prevents 3d content, however, wine supports many games
[23:43	<ferris_>	my son is looking for a fishing game for linux... do any of you know of one?

[23:56	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, that isn't good, do you have the 8.04 disk handy?
[23:56	<Abd>	tomtommy Yes hardy is out
[23:56	<tomtommy>	what program in Hardy can I use for webcam?
[23:56	<SonicStream>	Anyone have any help for what's going on with my printer?
[23:56	<androver>	SonicStream: try just choosing a printer that's like yours.  what's the exact printer model?
[23:56	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: nope
[23:56	<aphan9>	so i think my wireless network card does work, however i dont think it can detect any wireless networks
[23:56	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, does it boot?  What is the error?
[23:56	<SonicStream>	androver: Brother MFC-240C
[23:56	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, did you do a fresh new install?
[23:56	<djlenoir>	mkquist, no other OS installed, only hardy. other three hard drives do not even have a partition yet.
[23:56	<q4a>	GIn, it freeze at this screen http://k-net.ru/gallery/albums/userpics/12072/IMG_0872.JPG after loading livecd
[23:56	<tomtommy>	!webcam
[23:56	<ubotu>	Instructions for using webcams with Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Webcam - Supported cams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsMultimediaWebCameras
[23:56	<mkquist>	djlenoir: where did you install grub?
[23:56	<Platyhelminth>	yes tomtommy
[23:57	<SonicStream>	:o
[23:57	<armada>	man, mplayer's "Stop XScreensaver" option is full of problems
[23:57	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, which one did you install?  alternative?
[23:57	<Abd>	aphan9 I had a similar problem, but I compiled the 2.6.25 kernel, and got my wireless back working
[23:57	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: upgrade froze on libpng, then a bunch of errors. It was pretty much gutsy. it was not customised
[23:57	<shane2peru>	djlenoir, if there isn't anything on the other hdd, just unplug them and see if you can boot off the one.
[23:57	<armada>	in gusty it would give that error
[23:57	<djlenoir>	mkquist, hda1 (first SATA drive)
[23:57	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: PITA
[23:57	<armada>	and in hardy it makes sarting mplayer incredibly slow
[23:57	<fysa>	you ruined it, SpookyET.  how does it feel?
[23:57	<b4xt0r>	I am having trouble getting 2 sound cards to work together well, Would it be easier to use one sound card and map the output of Ventrilo to Aux for example, Speakers for everything else, and mic inpu?
[23:57	<aphan9>	abd how do u compile it, i'm not that good with that stuff lol
[23:57	<Platyhelminth>	tomtommy yes . I did an upgade with net but same error
[23:57	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, install Hardy Alternative ISO, not the liveCD one.  understood?
[23:58	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, before doing an upgrade, you should, 1.  backup, 2 have a new disk handy in case of failure
[23:58	<mkquist>	djlenoir: id go w/spookyet suggestion, take them out of the equation  till u get it working
[23:58	<blankhead>	androver: no i uninstalled thru terminal with sudo apt-get remove awn-core-applets-bzr
[23:58	<blankhead>	 it uninstalled successfully but now when i try to install avant thru add/remove it says Cannot install 'avant-window-navigator'
[23:58	<blankhead>	This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'avant-window-navigator' the conflicting software must be removed first.
[23:58	<blankhead>	Switch to the 'synaptic' package manager to resolve this conflict.
[23:58	<FloodBot2>	blankhead: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[23:58	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, that upgrade doesn't sound good.
=== avernos is now known as help
[23:58	<Platyhelminth>	I did not try the liveCD tomtommy
=== help is now known as averno
[23:58	<djlenoir>	shane2peru, I will give that a try then.
[23:58	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, listen carefully to what I am about to say :)   You should try a fresh and toally new install using ALTERNATIVE install
[23:58	<SonicStream>	-.-
[23:58	<crc32>	where is the cryptmount-setup script for  cryptmount?
[23:58	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: it's a crap distro. Upgrades should not fail
[23:58	<shane2peru>	djlenoir, then go from there
[23:58	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, have you tried that?
[23:58	<Abd>	I did with absolutely no problems. This site gave me a good help -->	http://howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
[23:58	<Platyhelminth>	tomtommy it is what i did
[23:58	<crc32>	or is there documentation for how to use cryptmount for ubuntu?
[23:59	<hayhay>	x1250: Hi - Said you would help me later - Thanks for offer - I got my other box that I lost my video on (was booting to a black screen without video) back up and running - Had changed my "System/Administration/Hardware Drivers/Nvidia/Enabled" After reboot it was downhill from there - figured out how to go into safe - and did auto-repair of x-server. Wheww - What a stupid thing to do without backing up my files 1st....
[23:59	<sunmao>	if somebody use squirrelmail pls pm me!!
[23:59	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, then go develop your own distro that doesn't fail on upgrades with 1,000s of users on 1,000s of different senarios.
[23:59	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, did you install it on a new fresh empty partition?
=== averno is now known as avernos
[23:59	<Abd>	aphan9 I followed all the steps and nothing went wrong
[23:59	<Platyhelminth>	YES
[23:59	<Platyhelminth>	i saw you it
[23:59	<Platyhelminth>	...
[23:59	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, try the livecd version now
[23:59	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, does the livecd load?
[23:59	<androver>	blankhead: weird, it usually will tell you which software conflicts with it.  try what it says; go to synaptic, see if it shows a conflict there.
[23:59	<Jordan_U>	ferris_, I think I may have found one, I saw a reference implying that this could be compiled for linux http://moppi.inside.org/eskimo/
[23:59	<Platyhelminth>	lol ok, i will download it then
[23:59	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, lol
[23:59	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: Arch Linux? That's what I'm running on my laptop. I had Ubuntu on my parents pc. unmodified gutsy.
[23:59	<bigtimer121>	i have just downloaded the compiz file and installed and restarted. I have selected the extra in the "visual settings", how do i customize things in compiz. i only have a apperance selection in preferences not an advanced preferencee

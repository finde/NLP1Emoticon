[positive]	[00:35]	<poseidon>	I try to save my settings to the x configuration file, but it gives me a permission denied
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Abd>	on network manager no wireless card is detected
[neutral]	[00:35]	<josh04>	Tristam: K
[negative]	[00:35]	<teamcobra>	Abd: sorted out in 2.6.25, there was  a weird conflict between your card's driver and the bcm4311rev2 that they just fixed
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Abd>	arrgghh
[neutral]	[00:35]	<mophead>	pelo: 9.04 is *really* brand new

[negative]	[00:35]	<Meshezabeel>	happinessturtle, what version you currently running?
[positive]	[00:35]	<Pelo>	phixxor, full  main and restricted repositories on the dvd , saves on some install download and  both live cd and text install
[neutral]	[00:35]	<seamus7>	happy_tux open system monitor and check what version is says you're running
[neutral]	[00:35]	<IndyGunFreak>	poseidon: you need to run gksudo nvidia-settings
[negative]	[00:35]	<otarid>	Pelo: How would I do that? (reconfiguring x-server)
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Wo0dy>	do you remember, people complained like that when 7.04 was released? As I said, it worked almost perfectly for me, but if people had problems also back then, then I'll upgrade. If 7.04 is known as a better release than it's followers, then I'll stick with it.
[neutral]	[00:35]	<ronartos>	how to know if ubuntu 8.04 detects my video card correctly?
[positive]	[00:35]	<Wo0dy>	guess that the solution is to just fetch a live cd and see how that works for me..
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Pelo>	otarid, sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[negative]	[00:35]	<mophead>	userx86: this is the support channel.  if you need help withi something, please feel free to ask.  If not, just wait around for someone to ask a question you can help them with
[negative]	[00:36]	<Abd>	i guess i'de better backup all my data and make a full install instead of the upgrade and see if hardy detects it
[neutral]	[00:36]	<happy_tux>	it says 8.04
[neutral]	[00:36]	<ronartos>	seems that xorg.conf shows diffrently
[neutral]	[00:36]	<t0dz>	uhm...
[neutral]	[00:36]	<happy_tux>	but it said that on beta i think
[negative]	[00:36]	<Pelo>	Wo0dy, use torrents, save the servers some load

[negative]	[00:36]	<Meshezabeel>	happy_tux, you do not need to upgrade from 8.04 to 8.04
[negative]	[00:36]	<Pelo>	dan__,  youc an't do it with a live cd,  only with the dvd or the alternate install cd
[negative]	[00:36]	<chcampb>	pelo: that second page i hadnt seen, the first i did... it mentioned /etc/samba/smb.conf - i checked that, and there are no passwords in that location.... it does, however, mention the general passwd program - i tried that program, man'd it, and it does not have any flags that will allow me to view/edit the samba password as opposed to the unix password.... and now im back to zero
[neutral]	[00:36]	<Sergiu9>	hello

[neutral]	[00:37]	<Sergiu9>	it is possible to upgrade gutsy alternate with hardy alternate cd?
[negative]	[00:37]	<Pelo>	chcampb,  I don'T realy know anyting about samba you are asking the wrong person

[negative]	[00:37]	<bsrat>	what does the webpage mean by '3 years of free updates'
[neutral]	[00:37]	<Pelo>	t0dz, ask in #xchat
[negative]	[00:38]	<astro76>	Sergiu9: you can use the hardy alternate cd to upgrade... it doesn't matter how you installed gutsy
[negative]	[00:38]	<mophead>	ronartos: you will get a better response if you say which card you are using and what you are running
[positive]	[00:38]	<dan__>	and update manager isnt good for release updates
[neutral]	[00:38]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both

[negative]	[00:38]	<t0dz>	"i puted xx ""for my name"" and then that now my ident.."
[positive]	[00:38]	<bsrat>	as in LTS..
[positive]	[00:38]	<Pelo>	bsrat, means that hardy is gonna get 3 years of support , because it is a LTS ,   the others only get 18 months,   for patches and security fixes
[negative]	[00:38]	<bsrat>	ah ok
[positive]	[00:38]	<teamcobra>	Abd: they're 2 conflicts in the b43 driver in 2.6.24..... I know for certain they fixed it in the new kernel, as I have the bcm4311rev02... been following this issue for a while ;)
[neutral]	[00:38]	<Starnestommy>	t0dz: /set irc_user_name new-ident
[negative]	[00:38]	<Shpook>	Oh no, I've got more problems. I had a failed upgrade last night due to a lost wireless connection(I believe). Now today when I boot up my laptop, it tells me that there is a file system problem on sda1, and forces fsck. The fsck fails, mounts the root files system in read-only, and loads a maintenance shell. Thing is, I never had anything mounted as sda. sda is reserved for USB devices and such, correct?
[negative]	[00:38]	<josh04>	illDecree: Can't help, sorry.
[neutral]	[00:39]	<joetheodd>	Are the repositories still bogged down?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<ronartos>	mophead: Intel 945GM

[neutral]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	t0dz,  can you summerize your issue in one line , this is a busy channel
[neutral]	[00:39]	<andril>	my upgrade went ok so far - but my sourcelist still has some Gutsy items - and I can change the cd to Heron - any help?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	joetheodd, expect it for one week at lest
[neutral]	[00:39]	<cod3rz>	.
[neutral]	[00:39]	<seamus7>	t0dz just go into System/Administration/UsersandGroups to change your username
[negative]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	least
[positive]	[00:39]	<josh04>	Shpook: sda can also be SATA drives
[neutral]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	lol
[negative]	[00:39]	<amenado>	Shpook-> nope
[neutral]	[00:39]	<userx86>	sphook my hard drive partitions are listed as /dev/sda
[positive]	[00:39]	<illDecree>	josh04: you dont think it will work?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	i will tape all in 1
[positive]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	wait a momento :P
[neutral]	[00:39]	<mophead>	ronartos: I can't help, but ask again with all the info
[neutral]	[00:39]	<MrRoboto>	Is Pulseaudio installed by default in Hardy?
[negative]	[00:39]	<joetheodd>	Pelo :(. I agree with whoever said releases shouldn't hit the repositories until torrents have been going for a week or so.
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Starnestommy>	MrRoboto: I think so
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	andril, just uncheck it in the software sources , in the admin menu
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	illDecree: No, i just don't know how to make it work :P Never used an S3 card
[negative]	[00:40]	<MrRoboto>	Starnestommy:  Well I can't see it
[negative]	[00:40]	<Shpook>	josh04, amenado, userx86: so, you're telling me this is bad news then?
[negative]	[00:40]	<Abd>	teamcobra so I guess the problem sis really on my laptop. I'll make a fresh install of hardy, maybe the problems get solved
[negative]	[00:40]	<Jack_Sparrow>	joetheodd, agreed
[negative]	[00:40]	<otarid>	Pelo: reconfiguring xserver didn't work (just asked me about keyboard and mouse)
[negative]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	joetheodd, well at least 24 hrs but tehre are still a lot of ppl that will try and upgrade online
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both
[negative]	[00:40]	<ronartos>	mophead: It's not very specific to my video card.. but how xorg.conf now display settings
[negative]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	otarid, try the binari driver then
[negative]	[00:40]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm not sure what's causing it
[negative]	[00:40]	<andril>	Pelo: i did but there seemd to be less Heron compared to Gutsy
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	Shpook: Not necessarily. It might just be a SATA drive :P
[negative]	[00:40]	<ronartos>	is there anyway I can check which card ubuntu 8.04 detected?
[negative]	[00:40]	<userx86>	sphook i barely understand the nature of your problem, i just know that sda isn't necessarily removable storage
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	otarid,  did you restart X after you reconfigured ?
[negative]	[00:40]	<amenado>	Shpook-> all am saying is sda does not get tied to USB devices
[neutral]	[00:40]	<d4t4min32>	can someone help me with connetion issues, i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager >
[neutral]	[00:40]	<josh04>	otarid: you don't have an intel 965 do you?
[neutral]	[00:40]	<otarid>	no
[negative]	[00:41]	<otarid>	let me try that
[neutral]	[00:41]	<teamcobra>	abd: no
[negative]	[00:41]	<joetheodd>	Pelo, the thing is, I'm still on the old one and I just want to install Azureus. I can't even download headers without timing out.
[negative]	[00:41]	<alienzero>	anybody know how to make the alt+tab behavior revert to the old style (it shows all windows at once)?
[negative]	[00:41]	<teamcobra>	Abd: the problem _won't_ get solved
[negative]	[00:41]	<Pelo>	andril, how did you upgrade anyway ?
[positive]	[00:41]	<bsrat>	can i add a 500Gb sata as primary and boot from that, and have an option to boot from current xp install on secondary sata which is 300Gb?
[negative]	[00:41]	<d4t4min32>	for some reason it just wont connect.. i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager > pasted in paste bin
[neutral]	[00:41]	<joetheodd>	Is there any way to change the timeout that APT uses when connecting to repositories?
[negative]	[00:41]	<illDecree>	josh04: alright... thanks!

[neutral]	[00:42]	<Starnestommy>	mariorz: build-essential
[neutral]	[00:42]	<Pelo>	andril, hmmm,  well you can always edit /etc/apt/sources.list  and comment out the gutsy lines,   just comment them out , don'T delete them  , just incase

[negative]	[00:46]	<mariorz>	mneptok: tough you might want to read it
[negative]	[00:46]	<manfromns>	i tried but there is no surround option

[neutral]	[00:46]	<mariorz>	s/tough/tought
[negative]	[00:46]	<Genotrius>	Well, I'll try it, but I don't think reinstalling it is what I need to do...
[positive]	[00:46]	<mneptok>	mariorz: if you are recommending aptitude, i think you should read it. :)
[neutral]	[00:46]	<josh04>	Tristam: Does it show as installed, present if you type ndiswrapper -l at the prompt? (You don't need to blacklist the modules for this)
[neutral]	[00:46]	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, does the battery charge with the computer shut down?
[negative]	[00:46]	<otarid>	josh04: Resolution is fine now, still have a problem with getting desktop effects and networking to work
[neutral]	[00:46]	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darkside, , does the battery charge with the computer shut down
[negative]	[00:47]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, so its not doing the wpa authentication... have you tried it on an open wifi connection?
[negative]	[00:47]	<KiwiJoker>	mneptok exactly what i was thinking lol
[negative]	[00:47]	<Pelo>	Darkside, isn'T battery recharge a hardware thing ?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Darkside>	well you can control it in the bios too
[negative]	[00:47]	<mneptok>	"mariorz: especially this bit: ""So the points outlined on this page about using aptitude over apt-get are largely irrelevant if you're using Edgy Eft (6.10), Feisty Fawn (7.04), or any future version of Ubuntu."""
[negative]	[00:47]	<nomasteryoda>	someone else please help d4t4min32
[negative]	[00:47]	<Abd>	teambobra thanks for your tips, i'll try to do that. Thanks again

[negative]	[00:47]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: as in typing xmms2? i did that all it says is all the commands like (play, stop, ect)
[neutral]	[00:47]	<nomasteryoda>	have to run
[positive]	[00:47]	<teamcobra>	Abd: I have faith, you'll do just fine ;)

[positive]	[00:47]	<teamcobra>	I redid my first kernel when I was 13 ;) (11 years ago)
[negative]	[00:47]	<mophead>	darkside, pelo: I'm running a toshiba a200 and mine did the same thing for a while
[neutral]	[00:47]	<d4t4min32>	"but my ""linksys"" is open .. now wep"
[negative]	[00:47]	<josh04>	"otarid: I had some trouble getting it to not use the VESA driver. Does it show Driver ""intel"" in xorg.conf?"
[neutral]	[00:47]	<d4t4min32>	*no wep
[negative]	[00:47]	<teamcobra>	and if I could do it then, you definitely can do it now
[negative]	[00:47]	<mariorz>	mneptok: uhm i did? did you?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Darkside>	mophead, did you solve it?
[negative]	[00:47]	<Darknezz>	Jack_Sparrow: im running a PC not a laptop
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, tab completion error
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Genotrius>	Pelo: It's at the newest installed version.
[positive]	[00:48]	<mophead>	Darkside: I think it sorta solved itself
[negative]	[00:48]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, I think you need to install a packages called xmms2-gtk or somesuch, rigth now you only have  a command line xmms2
[neutral]	[00:48]	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz stick with apt-get bud
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Tristam>	josh04, it reports bcmwl5: driver installed
[negative]	[00:48]	<mophead>	I have no idea how
[neutral]	[00:48]	<cegopaiva>	hi everyone
[neutral]	[00:48]	<mneptok>	mariorz: yes. and i also know what the distro team recommends. and that's apt-get.
[neutral]	[00:48]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: did you see anythign that stuck out as being an issue
[negative]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	thing is, its picking up the battery
[negative]	[00:48]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, there is soemonee else with a nick close to yours we get confused, if you are told battery stuff ignore it
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	and it was discharging from it
[negative]	[00:48]	<mariorz>	mneptok: why? aptitude removes unneeded dependencies when removed
[negative]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	but it can't charge it for some readon :<
[neutral]	[00:48]	<josh04>	Tristam: Are you sure that's the right driver? As in, have you used it before?
[negative]	[00:48]	<doug2266778822>	would using someone elses codec files ruin my comp? if we both have same distro.
[neutral]	[00:48]	<mneptok>	mariorz: and so does apt-get
[negative]	[00:48]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, then its defintely the wpa supplicant causing the issue... might want to seek out wicd ... i would google it ... what i use, but it can have issues with compiz... or so i'm told
[neutral]	[00:48]	<r557>	anyone here use a freedns such as dyndns or another?
[negative]	[00:48]	<Darknezz>	Pelo lol ok
[negative]	[00:48]	<mariorz>	mneptok: and why did the write it if they dont want you to use it
[negative]	[00:48]	<nibsa1242b>	I need help. Prior to upgrade to Hardy I enjoyed using Kate (in Gnome) as an editor. Since the upgrade if I try to open something in Kate nothing happens.
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: kk
[negative]	[00:49]	<Abd>	teamcobra each kernel I tried to compile went wrong, but at time i was suing suse 5.3
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Tristam>	josh04, I was using it in gutsy before I upgraded this morning
[negative]	[00:49]	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz i think you missed the point of that blog
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Pelo>	nibsa1242b, sudo apt-get install kate
[neutral]	[00:49]	<mneptok>	mariorz: the distro team did not write aptitude
[neutral]	[00:49]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: i dont follow
[negative]	[00:49]	<Jack_Sparrow>	mariorz, our apt-get is virtually no different that aptitude.. not your average apt-get
[neutral]	[00:49]	<robeph>	doug2266778822: do what?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Jack_Sparrow>	than'
[neutral]	[00:49]	<d4t4min32>	what is wpa supplicant
[neutral]	[00:49]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, also daveyates at lottalinuxlinks recommends it over network manager ... another network manager wicd is
[neutral]	[00:49]	<robeph>	codec a la....?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<josh04>	Tristam: So it should work then. How are you connected at the moment?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<mariorz>	isnt aptitude ubuntu specific?
[negative]	[00:49]	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: its already installed it just doesn't open when I click on it

[negative]	[00:50]	<robeph>	heh you know I've never used aptitude =\
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Pelo>	nibsa1242b, my guess is it is not , you only hve the link in the menu,  install it again
[positive]	[00:50]	<madhamster>	problem: ubuntu fucks up xp when installing
[negative]	[00:50]	<mariorz>	i see, and what is the reason for recomending apt-get?
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Sergiu9>	!codec
[positive]	[00:50]	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: @HLINK - See also @HLINK - But please use free formats if you can: @HLINK
[positive]	[00:50]	<robeph>	I always use apt-get =s

[negative]	[00:50]	<carl>	im thinking my mirror doesnt have all the packages
[negative]	[00:50]	<robeph>	still confused as what he meant to someone elses codec and how this could hurt anything
[negative]	[00:50]	<efrancolaporte>	so what do you guys think of ubuntu 8.04
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, I'm not saying that's the package name,  check in synaptic,  search for xmms and see what is available
[neutral]	[00:50]	<RoAkSoAx>	after installing compizconfig-settings-manager, does anyone of you seen unchaged option ins System>Preferences>Appearance???
[negative]	[00:50]	<mneptok>	mariorz: apt-get gets improvements written for it. like the ones that page you linked to describe. aptitude does not.
[positive]	[00:50]	<robeph>	efrancolaporte: it's like ubuntu 8 beta =)... with less bugs
[positive]	[00:50]	<astro76>	carl: go to system > admin > software sources, and uncheck the CD as a source
[negative]	[00:50]	<thegattaca>	Simple question ... how does one install ubuntu on a system which only has 256 megs of ram? Tried xubuntu as well, no go ...
[negative]	[00:50]	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: I just reinstalled it. It now works if I click on it from the menu, however, it doesn't open the file if I right click and select open with Kate.
[neutral]	[00:50]	<mophead>	efrancolaporte: this is actuallyu just the support channel... see the topic
[neutral]	[00:50]	<koomber1664>	hmmm. Just installed Ubuntu, but the screen keeps flickering.  Using an Nvidia 8600GT

[negative]	[00:51]	<Genotrius>	So here I am with the latest installed version of ubuntu-desktop, and GNOME not working except for in Failsafe mode. I guess I should try reinstalling ubuntu-desktop in Synaptec, then?
[neutral]	[00:51]	<mneptok>	mariorz: np
[negative]	[00:51]	<cegopaiva>	is there someone brazilian on here? sorry my bad english
[negative]	[00:51]	<robeph>	doug2266778822: theoretically you're not supposed to be able to play dvds I don't think
[neutral]	[00:51]	<carl>	gone
[positive]	[00:51]	<madhamster>	it said on the ubuntu page that you should report bugs here, ubuntu fucks up xp if you install it the newest version
[neutral]	[00:51]	<otarid>	No josh04, it's not really showing any driver there (default screen, different monitor, etc.)
[positive]	[00:51]	<norbi>	Hello, just wanted to stop by and say that I am liking Linux/Ubuntu so far.  First time user, everything so far went smooth.  Had problems with mp3/video/embedded web codecs, but nothing a little googling didn't fix.  Awesome community, keep up the good work.  I am pretty sure if problems show up this place will be of much help.  See you all around :)
[neutral]	[00:51]	<mneptok>	madhamster: language, please
[negative]	[00:51]	<Genotrius>	Or tic, whichever one doesn't mean a touchpad...
[neutral]	[00:51]	<robeph>	doug2266778822:  is it actual DVD format?
[negative]	[00:51]	<Seven_Six_Two>	Those poor upgrade servers...I still can't upgrade without the connection failing
[negative]	[00:51]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: lol how do you search again?
[positive]	[00:51]	<efrancolaporte>	Pelo, yeah i know but you guys are the heroes of linux, if it wasn't for you, 99% would give up, the linux community owes you a lot :)

[negative]	[00:52]	<josh04>	Tristam: As it's not showing up as present in ndiswrapper -l, do you know how to use ndiswrapper -a to set the driver to the device manually?
[negative]	[00:52]	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: ok, I'm trying that... I'm not quite sure how to do that
[positive]	[00:52]	<madhamster>	mm ubuntu lookd pretty cool actually :) best release I've seen... though this xp fuckup thing is not sweet

[negative]	[00:52]	<Mythril>	Does anyone know how I change the mirrors apt uses (in a non-graphical way?)
[neutral]	[00:52]	<MattJ>	koomber1664: In System->Preferences->Appearance, disable Visual Effects, does it help?
[neutral]	[00:52]	<robeph>	doug2266778822: you may wish to seek support on some of the non distro specific dvd sites about using them in linux
[neutral]	[00:52]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: how hard would it be to install and use this
[neutral]	[00:52]	<sysrpl>	hi

[neutral]	[00:53]	<MattJ>	priman: DVD contains more packages (so you don't need to download them) that's all afaik
[negative]	[00:53]	<Seven_Six_Two>	d4t4min32, I wish I could. I don't know a lot about wireless on linux

[neutral]	[00:54]	<josh04>	Tristam: Ah, must have misread before. Are you sure you're blacklisting both the b43 driver and the ssb driver?
[negative]	[00:54]	<MattJ>	magic_hat: Remove (or comment out the CD lines), and then sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[00:54]	<magic_hat>	MattJ: waht am I looking for? never messed w/ that before.

[neutral]	[00:54]	<d4t4min32>	its open, no encry
[negative]	[00:54]	<josh04>	Tristam: I think there's something else which relies on the ssb driver, might be ohci_usb
[negative]	[00:54]	<mophead>	d4t4min32: explain y our issue, including which version you are running, on what kind of machine, and which wireless care you're using.  that makes it easier to get a response here

[neutral]	[00:55]	<mophead>	d4t4min32: you could also try googling the name of your wifi driver and ubuntu and problem
[positive]	[00:55]	<josh04>	Tristam: Try adding ohci_usb to the blacklist as well. It only runs legacy usb drivers AFAIK, so it shouldn't be a problem

I just upgraded from 7.10 and it used to work great there. Could it be related to the wireless on/off button not working anymore? (it used to be lit when on)?

[negative]	[00:59]	<backlash>	im looking around in network settings
[negative]	[00:59]	<NetEcho>	ah so the issues are probably mirror issues
[negative]	[00:59]	<carl>	NetEcho: there would be possible issues upgrading any OS
[neutral]	[00:59]	<astro76>	WhoNeedszzz: usually a few days
[negative]	[00:59]	<gravemind>	"hey, I'm using the alternate cd on an amd 64 system, and for some reason, the ""DIstribution Upgrade"" application hangs on the first step. What is up?"

[neutral]	[01:00]	<NetEcho>	carl so the issues are probably people not changing the apt mirrors?

[neutral]	[01:01]	<Makgyver>	all
[neutral]	[01:01]	<popey>	moveax: recordmydesktop is good for recording a compiz-enabled desktop, xvidcap isnt
[negative]	[01:01]	<carl>	NetEcho: no prob when you stick in the alternate cd you get a popup with an upgrade button
[negative]	[01:01]	<happy_tux>	then kernel seems to load up
[neutral]	[01:01]	<Tristam>	josh04, still no luck  I'm going to start from scratch and see what happens
[neutral]	[01:01]	<mophead>	squish: afaik, just backup your data, wipe hardy and re-install gutsy online

[negative]	[01:01]	<Pelo>	NetEcho, I'm just recommending the torrents over the website downloads,  easier on the servers
[negative]	[01:01]	<Makgyver>	are there for any silly reason any PowerMac G4 users here

[negative]	[01:02]	<Gun_Smoke>	WhoNeedszzz: I'm having none atm
[neutral]	[01:02]	<NetEcho>	ah thanks
[negative]	[01:02]	<gravemind>	happy_tux: I'm using the alt cd to upgrade, not to install

[negative]	[01:02]	<josh04>	Tristam: Good luck. ssb is the one you need to make sure isn't loading, it claims the card away from ndiswrapper
[neutral]	[01:02]	<WhoNeedszzz>	Gun_Smoke: and how much stuff do u have?
[negative]	[01:02]	<NetEcho>	carl chances are I'll do a complete fresh install since I don't have any important files under 7.10
[negative]	[01:02]	<Makgyver>	I cannot for the life of me get the live CD to boot, I keep getting dropped into initfs
[negative]	[01:02]	<moveax>	popey: well it records it fine, frame-rate wise, but not colour depth wise. It seems it's using a low colour depth, or a very odd colour palett

[neutral]	[01:02]	<mophead>	squish: I'm not sure what yoiu mean... /home is all your personal files e.g. downloads and stuff, so I would recommend backing that up
[neutral]	[01:02]	<backlash>	d4t4min32, i see 127.0.0.1 localhost and 127.0.1.1 bender
[neutral]	[01:02]	<josh04>	Tristam: Np
[neutral]	[01:02]	<d4t4min32>	change the local host to bender

[neutral]	[01:03]	<d4t4min32>	backlash: change the localhost to bender

[negative]	[01:46]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Well if you want performance on the desktop, you might want to look into using either fluxbox or XFCE as your desktop manager, rather than GNOME or KDE
[positive]	[01:46]	<SeaPhor>	Starnestommy: Thanks!

[neutral]	[01:48]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: It can certainly be skinned to look reasonable. I used it for about a year on a 500mhz K6-2 and it was fast enough
[negative]	[01:48]	<Pelo>	dassouki, that's all I have atm check in the forum there was someting about bypassing  pulseaudio ,  that migth help you

[negative]	[01:48]	<darkcrab>	how do I make videolan media player the default for dvds?
[negative]	[01:48]	<astro76>	Juan: links only work locally.. you need to do it in /etc/fstab, and obviously the network share would have to be connected to earlier in the boot process
[positive]	[01:48]	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  in particular, web browsing
[negative]	[01:48]	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  maybe I should try epiphany
[negative]	[01:48]	<simmerz>	jhow: explain the problem. don't ask if you can ask. just ask
[negative]	[01:48]	<gravemind>	Pelo, I wonder if I should report it as a bug
[positive]	[01:48]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Never tried XP on it, sorry, so i can't compare. It used to be 98 :P
[neutral]	[01:49]	<Roshane>	Pelo can i upgrade 7.04 to 8.04
[negative]	[01:49]	<gluer>	Q: how do i turn off ip6??
[negative]	[01:49]	<astro76>	Juan: also you would want that share to support Linux file permissions, so that means no samba
[negative]	[01:49]	<Pelo>	cardstroker,  in terminal  gksu nautilus /var/cache/apt   delete .deb file in there that you don'T know you need
[positive]	[01:49]	<dassouki>	pelo,  is it odd that both are decice zereo @HLINK

[neutral]	[01:50]	<gluer>	starnestommy: says error module ipv6 is in use

[neutral]	[01:52]	<Pelo>	comerc, what video card ?
[negative]	[01:52]	<Abd>	simonft2 I have the same problem. It appears with 2.6.25 the issue is solved. I'm compiling a new kernel and i'll see how it goes

[neutral]	[01:53]	<Skuller>	genii: I read around a bit for dansguardian. It seems slightly complex to get it up and running. Any other alternatives or some simplified help on getting it up and running in as short time as possible?
[positive]	[01:53]	<cardstroker>	"pelo, I got- ""cannot remove /var/cache/apt/archives/partial, it is a directory."

[neutral]	[01:53]	<dassouki>	pelo, is there a way, i can run the sound setup that is used in the ubuntu setup?

[neutral]	[01:54]	<simonft2>	﻿Abd: 2.6.25 what?
[negative]	[01:54]	<gravemind>	jrabbit: sounds like the best thing to do is research about your monitor, and then go to a virtual terminal (like ctrl-alt-F3) and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg with the correct information

[negative]	[01:54]	<comerc>	ahhh okay... so that should install on the computer because it is a driver problem probably with the video card?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<josh04>	Josh04: Firefox 3.0, though if these guys are telling you envy that might be more worth it

[positive]	[01:54]	<gravemind>	jrabbit: but it's an easy fix
[negative]	[01:55]	<NDPMacBook>	Skuller: Easiest way I can think of is to use a router that has parental controls software built in between your DSL modem and the 3 PCs.

[negative]	[01:56]	<howapt>	Does anyone know where the login settings are stored? Since upgrading I now have to log in twice...
[negative]	[01:56]	<acoustyk>	astro76: It was a plugin interference.  I solved the problem but thanks!
[negative]	[01:56]	<Skuller>	NDPMacBook: Yes, that's true. Unfortunately no expenses can be made at the moment to buy additional hardware by the school. Thanks
[negative]	[01:56]	<simonft2>	﻿chaqu1: lots of people seem to be having that problem
[negative]	[01:56]	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  maybe this is as fast as it's supposed to be, too bad there isn't a benchmark I could use to test it
[negative]	[01:56]	<Pelo>	cardstroker, did you make a seperate partiton for your /  ?
[negative]	[01:56]	<Millertime_018>	hey every automated download that i've tried is failing!
[neutral]	[01:56]	<ToM-X>	Hey, does anyone know how to get Kicker fully working on ubuntu?

[neutral]	[01:56]	<Al-Khouli>	hi guys, is there a risk in changing sources.list to have gutsy words replaced with hardy then do an upgrade ?!

[negative]	[01:56]	<nith>	Flannel: thx, I must not have updated my sources file yet. I was kinda hoping it'd be e17
[negative]	[01:57]	<Skuller>	genii: thanks. Sorry to not have found this myself.

[neutral]	[01:57]	<Flannel>	nith: e17 isn't out yet
[positive]	[01:57]	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  even when I'm not doing anything on firefox, it using resources, sometimes a lot
[neutral]	[01:57]	<genii>	Skuller: np

[neutral]	[01:57]	<Pelo>	Millertime_018,  download of what ?
[negative]	[01:57]	<thinkingfrog>	I should install epiphany, I'll do that now

[negative]	[01:57]	<Millertime_018>	my update still doesnt work at all and now my add/remove app wont quit failing on app downloads!
[neutral]	[01:57]	<Pelo>	Al-Khouli, yes there is , don' tdo that
[negative]	[01:57]	<Flannel>	Al-Khouli: It's doable yes, just make sure you have all the proper metapackages, or just let update-manager do it for you.
[positive]	[01:57]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: don't trust the stats ;) Ubuntu's task manager and XP's task manager record things in entirely different ways

[negative]	[01:58]	<Roshane>	what about softwares that i normally use in windows, can i get those to run on ubuntu?
[negative]	[01:58]	<Pelo>	cardstroker, was this an empty hdd before you tried to isntall ?
[negative]	[01:58]	<IndyGunFreak>	bagelong: probably because there's not a restricted driver available?

[neutral]	[01:59]	<thinkingfrog>	chaqul:  what video card?
[negative]	[01:59]	<Flannel>	Roshane: depending on what they are, yes.  But you're better off finding comperable programs that are native, and using those instead.

[neutral]	[02:10]	<Flannel>	aboo0ood_: Changing sources.list won't help, it still connects to the same servers, and through the same libraries.  Try a different mirror (software sources).  You do need to remember that a *lot* of people are trying to get stuff from the mirrors right now, so it is completely possible that its just too slow

[negative]	[02:27]	<jeeves__>	dassouki, how'd you guess?
[negative]	[02:27]	<Pelo>	bagelong, ok it is likely that there is not linux driver for your card,  so you will have to use the windows driver with ndiswrapper,   that,s mentionned in the wifi docs

[negative]	[02:44]	<Flannel>	Zaqq: what sort of input?
[neutral]	[02:44]	<gravemind>	lol
[negative]	[02:44]	<Pelo>	isdepopecath, no promisses yet,    M$ does not play well with others and Vista is their latest attempt at bullying other OSes from the computers,  might not work

[positive]	[02:45]	<bazhang>	Starnestommy: not for gutsy, but is in repos for hardy

[neutral]	[02:48]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm confused
[negative]	[02:48]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: making a separate partition for /home is a good idea, but I would choose ext3 if I were you
[negative]	[02:48]	<Assid>	gravemind: oh i had that issue yday.. was converting a guy to TRY ubuntu
[negative]	[02:48]	<Pelo>	bjb1959, what do yo want to know ?
[positive]	[02:48]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, you type that in :)
[negative]	[02:48]	<doug_>	I'm having a problem with the nvidia driver for 8.04 AMD64.  Has anyone seen an actual solution?
[negative]	[02:48]	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<josh04>	bagelong: Just try the apt-get command and if it's already installed it'll just say
[neutral]	[02:49]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, but you don't have to worry about that as you're not upgrading
[negative]	[02:49]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  ok
[negative]	[02:49]	<Assid>	gravemind: finally refused to resize the partition.. and hes like screw it.. and left it on vista
[negative]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	doug_, what is the actual problem ?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<gravemind>	Assid: heh, wow
[neutral]	[02:49]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: so when i make a new i'l choose ext3?
[positive]	[02:49]	<biabia>	bazant that last one is an external. all three drives mount fine if i select the previous kernel but when i select the new one i get an error saying i need to update the driver sd and sr
[neutral]	[02:49]	<ffm_>	Which is better in a mirror, latency or bandwidth?
[negative]	[02:49]	<Assid>	gravemind: yeah.. it ran for over an hour and did NOTHING
[positive]	[02:49]	<bazhang>	biabia: are you able to check their new listings and adjust fstab accordingly? able to mount them manually?
[negative]	[02:49]	<doug_>	a black screen ... can get to ttys ok
[negative]	[02:49]	<senghoo>	HI ~ ALL
[neutral]	[02:49]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error @HLINK
[negative]	[02:49]	<bjb1959>	Pelo I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	bjb1959, check i menu > syusetm > admin > users check your user's permission  to shutdown
[positive]	[02:49]	<nucco>	ffm_: both :) higher bandwidth, lower latency is better
[neutral]	[02:49]	<bagelong>	josh04:says I am good to go aready.
[negative]	[02:49]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes. now right now, are you running on the live cd, or are you installed already?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<AlienX>	ffm_, that's kind of a silly question as both factors are important
[negative]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: then i'l have 2 filesystems whit ext3
[negative]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	AlienX, I realize that.
[negative]	[02:50]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: wrong link?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<kbrooks>	question
[neutral]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i have instaled allready
[negative]	[02:50]	<josh04>	bagelong: type ndiswrapper -l, it shoul say no drivers isntalled
[neutral]	[02:50]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes, however you also need a swap partition
[negative]	[02:50]	<kbrooks>	how do i show the time directly on my desktop?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	doug_, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from the recovery mode
[negative]	[02:50]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: of about 1 gb in size
[neutral]	[02:50]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is there a wlan0 in iwconfig?
[negative]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	AlienX, I mean is a mirror with higher latency but higher bandwith better than a close mirror with less bandwith?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<bazhang>	ffm_: bandwidth but kinda offtopic here
[neutral]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	kbrooks, gdesklets, or screenlets
[negative]	[02:50]	<bjb1959>	Pelo Oh that's right, I forgot about making sure permissions are set right after upgrade. thanks I'll try that first
[neutral]	[02:50]	<doug_>	thanks ... I'll try it
[neutral]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	kbrooks, or conky or gtkrll
[negative]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: oky. but how will thath efekt my system whit 2 ext3 systems?
[positive]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	bazhang, Not really, this is about ubuntu repo mirrors.
[negative]	[02:50]	<LainIwakura>	Hello.. I installed this font and it shows up in xfontsel but not in any drop-down fonts menu. How do I actually use the font? Thanks for any help.
[negative]	[02:50]	<AlienX>	ffm_, neither is an indication of what download speeds you'll actually get
[negative]	[02:50]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  igot this E: Couldn't find package envyng
[negative]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	Alright, downloading.
[negative]	[02:51]	<evilbug>	Pelo- i completely re-installed gutsy and installed all the updates for it,and now when i log in it gets stuck on the light brown screen.
[neutral]	[02:51]	<kbrooks>	Pelo, ty
[negative]	[02:51]	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings, but i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
[negative]	[02:51]	<seriouslycgi>	anyone help me with samba configuration its kinda dead in the samba channel?
[neutral]	[02:51]	<bazhang>	ffm_: you creating one?
[neutral]	[02:51]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i wont loose all the files i have now?
[negative]	[02:51]	<nucco>	ffm_: probably... unless your pipe is smaller than the lower mirror, and you think it won't be crowded
[negative]	[02:51]	<bagelong>	josh04:  in the terminal?  Nothing happended
[neutral]	[02:51]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, cd to the directory where you downloaded envy
[neutral]	[02:51]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error configure: error: *** GTK+ >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first ***
[neutral]	[02:51]	<Darknezz>	 (HAHAHA sorry)
[neutral]	[02:51]	<ffm_>	bazhang, No.
[positive]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	evilbug- install hardy :)
[neutral]	[02:51]	<cygoku_>	How are the repositories feeling right now ?!?!
[neutral]	[02:51]	<cardstroker>	rkvirani, what ya got?
[negative]	[02:51]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: it doesn't make a difference in how your system will run, it's just a little bit safer to have /home on a separate partition. but you don't really have to
[neutral]	[02:51]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, though i *think* ubuntu has some tool that'll let you just click on the package and it'll install for you
[positive]	[02:51]	<nucco>	ffm_: or use bittorrent and forget about bandwidth issues :)
[negative]	[02:51]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm stuck.  I can't figure out why that keeps failing
[negative]	[02:51]	<evilbug>	osxdude- that didn't work,the install gave me crap :|
[neutral]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	cygoku_, I think they are good
[neutral]	[02:51]	<ffm_>	nucco, that won't work for APT, will it?
[positive]	[02:51]	<josh04>	bagelong: Hold on while I find you a link
[neutral]	[02:51]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: the reason you can't resize your existing partition is because you're running on it
[positive]	[02:51]	<bazhang>	ffm_: what is the exact nature of your issue then? just curious/chat or have actual issues creating a mirror
[negative]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	evilbug- what kind of crap?
[neutral]	[02:52]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, install the related -dev package , look in synaptic
[neutral]	[02:52]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  i dont download the envy, coz i dont know where is the download package
[positive]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: if you boot up from the live cd, you will be able to resize it
[positive]	[02:52]	<nucco>	ffm_: :p silly me :p
[neutral]	[02:52]	<ffm_>	bazhang, I'm choosing a mirror for my systems.
[negative]	[02:52]	<Pelo>	ok I'M going on a brake, later folks
[neutral]	[02:52]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it's on the page.
[neutral]	[02:52]	<cygoku_>	Cool.
[neutral]	[02:52]	<ffm_>	nucco, I bittorrent the ISOs of course...
[neutral]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: maybe that's what you should do, if you don't want 2 partitions
[negative]	[02:52]	<nucco>	ffm_: latency generally won't affect the speed of the download
[negative]	[02:52]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it'll be something like envyng.deb or something
[negative]	[02:52]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i did but it still dont work
[negative]	[02:52]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i want to have 2 partisjons
[negative]	[02:52]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, 1 sec,,
[negative]	[02:52]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i almost installed all the files
[positive]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: good :)
[neutral]	[02:52]	<trippingmonke1>	does anyone here have any experience with the NVIDIA 169.12 driver in hardy?
[negative]	[02:52]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: but i don't wanna lose the files i already have in /home
[neutral]	[02:52]	<josh04>	bagelong: Can you type lspci and copy me the line referring to Broadcom?
[positive]	[02:53]	<bazhang>	ffm_: best to hold off on choosing; the ones you choose now may not be the best because of the recent release of hardy
[positive]	[02:53]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: thanks
[negative]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: ok, we will be careful, and not lose them
[negative]	[02:53]	<binarybandit>	hey all, trying to install with wubi, and I just get dropped to an initramfs shell on reboot
[negative]	[02:53]	<evilbug>	osxdude- a bunch of install errors.
[negative]	[02:53]	<hdevalence>	hmm, would it be possible to have the gutsy->hardy updater download packages via torrent?
[neutral]	[02:53]	<seriouslycgi>	im trying to share a folder on a default install (ubuntu 7.10 server) of samba and im following a tutorial online to add the folder, but when i try to browse it in midnight commander it shows up but i cant desend into it. (error: cannot change directory) ive set up my user and password and enabled that user and the directory is owned by the same user details and has read write exe? my smb.conf @HLINK
[negative]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: I'll look for the guide that tells how to do what we're trying to do
[neutral]	[02:53]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, yes
[negative]	[02:53]	<supertimmy>	how do i change the theme in hardy? what kind of theme files do i need to download?
[neutral]	[02:53]	<bagelong>	josh04: 0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4310 USB Controller (rev 01)
[neutral]	[02:53]	<mayakuza>	gravemind oky
[negative]	[02:53]	<bazhang>	hdevalence: would be nice but no
[negative]	[02:53]	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings for those drives,   i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
[positive]	[02:53]	<evilbug>	osxdude- i got gutsy to work now :) nevermind.
[neutral]	[02:53]	<nankiller2>	ÇÑ±¹ÀÎ ³ª¿Í¶ó
[neutral]	[02:53]	<leo_rockw>	supertimmy: gnome-look.org will probably help you out

[neutral]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: @HLINK
[negative]	[02:53]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Do any networks show up in nm-applet then?
[neutral]	[02:53]	<osxdude>	awww man
[negative]	[02:54]	<Andross>	hello all, I'm having trouble with my laptop running hardy, it doesn't seem to want to bring up the onboard eth0 and I can't get wireless working without it
[neutral]	[02:54]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: ty
[negative]	[02:54]	<ffm_>	bazhang, I get 1.9miB/s on MIT, and pretty much the same on olsol.
[positive]	[02:54]	<evand>	binarybandit: try adding edd=on to the kernel command line.
[positive]	[02:54]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: sure thing :)
[neutral]	[02:54]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  u tols me to openhere--> @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:54]	<josh04>	bagelong: download this: @HLINK

[neutral]	[02:54]	<ffm_>	*osuosl
[negative]	[02:54]	<binarybandit>	the first time I attempted the install, it worked, but the partitioning tool failed with error code ten, so I uninstall, and tried a reinstall
[negative]	[02:54]	<supertimmy>	leo_rockw: i am downloading themes from there but can't find how to import them
[positive]	[02:54]	<binarybandit>	evand, mmk, thanks
[negative]	[02:54]	<bazhang>	biabia: not sure if the instructions have changed for hardy; and you have the old ones around may you not try those out?
[negative]	[02:54]	<mojo>	I've been using XChat for a few years but decided to try xchat-gnome.  Seems nice and clean but how do I remove join/part messages?
[negative]	[02:54]	<leo_rockw>	supertimmy: oh, ok... i can't help you there, i'm a kde fanboi
[negative]	[02:54]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, how do i get there?
[positive]	[02:54]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, yes, go to that web page
[negative]	[02:54]	<evand>	binarybandit: if that doesn't work, cat /casper.log at the initramfs prompt, shift page up and look for errors
[negative]	[02:54]	<ffm_>	bazhang, Is there a program I can run that will do so automatically? The GUI just does latency.
[neutral]	[02:55]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, follow the directions there
[neutral]	[02:55]	<bazhang>	ffm_: nice to know thanks
[positive]	[02:55]	<binarybandit>	thanks :)
[negative]	[02:55]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: It's the one in the top right shaped like a computer
[negative]	[02:55]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, then you should have working nvidia drivers
[neutral]	[02:55]	<doug2266778822>	anyone in here use convert x to dvd?
[neutral]	[02:55]	<fraserdp>	has anyone installed ndiswrapper with cisco aironet minipci 350 ?
[negative]	[02:55]	<biabia>	bazhang: ok i dont remember checking the listing for the drives would you know the command for that
[positive]	[02:55]	<evand>	binarybandit: also, removing 'quiet splash' from the kernel command line (escape at grub, e, then e on the kernel line) will show you more information
[positive]	[02:55]	<Andross>	I need to know how to get a driver to control a certain network interface, I know it should happen automatically, but it isn't
[negative]	[02:55]	<hdevalence>	bazhang: how hard would it be to do for next time?
[negative]	[02:55]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i have 2, 1 for lan and 2 for wlan
[negative]	[02:55]	<thinkingfrog>	if composite is enabled in xorg.conf, but compiz effects aren't used, will there be a performance benefit?

[neutral]	[02:56]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, no
[negative]	[02:56]	<bazhang>	hdevalence: you mean instead of dpkg/apt/aptitude?
[neutral]	[02:56]	<bagelong>	josh04: It's downloaded.
[positive]	[02:56]	<biabia>	bazhang: it does now, but i am on the older kernel. i will reboot and try it
[positive]	[02:56]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is your router turned on ;)
[neutral]	[02:56]	<AlienX>	"Wolf23, see where it says ""get envyng""?"
[negative]	[02:56]	<binarybandit>	ah, I see, windows is holding the drive, I just have to do a clean shutdown

[neutral]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	!terminal | enaner
[positive]	[03:18]	<ubotu>	enaner: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Guide: @HLINK
[negative]	[03:18]	<jstritar>	"my problems started when it tried installing ""lopenofice-org-writer2latex"" then a lot of things failed after that"

[negative]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	jstritar, The problem is when you use a lot of packages unsupported by ubuntu.
[negative]	[03:18]	<enaner>	osxdude someone told me that i can have KDE desktop on ubuntu and tat i dun need kubuntu for that

[neutral]	[03:18]	<josh04>	SUGAR
[negative]	[03:18]	<osxdude>	enaner: I know ou can have KDE in Ubuntu, but I do not know how.
[negative]	[03:18]	<jstritar>	ffm_: do you know where i can at least see a log of the install? /var/log/apt doesn't have it
[negative]	[03:18]	<Nutzebahn>	Hi. Does anyone know of any fingerprint scanner software that will work on Ubuntu?
[negative]	[03:19]	<Pelo>	gooody, pidgin and amsn do I think

[negative]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	jstritar, Sadly, I don't know.
[neutral]	[03:19]	<mikebot>	ffm_: Haha, touché!
[negative]	[03:19]	<MewRS>	nucco: could not read /dev/sdb
[negative]	[03:19]	<jstritar>	ffm_: even so, it shoudl recognize packages that aren't supported and at least warn you
[negative]	[03:19]	<darkcrab>	yea, I only unchecked the ones like crash reporter. or like bluetooth because my system doesnt have bluetooth.
[neutral]	[03:19]	<MewRS>	nucco: but the pendrive blinked..
[neutral]	[03:19]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, ? thats the same one i sent b4?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn, did you check in the repositories ?  menu > sytem> admin > synaptic
[neutral]	[03:19]	<xyzpaw>	is ssh for hacking?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	jstritar, It did, when you first installed them.
[positive]	[03:19]	<nucco>	MewRS: second time I'm seeing that today, means the drive is probably gone for good
[negative]	[03:19]	<slashzul>	how do you add gnome desktop on a ubuntu server install?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<osxdude>	no, xyzpaw
[negative]	[03:19]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: what do you mean by hacking?
[negative]	[03:19]	<seriouslycgi>	mikebot, theres more channels like #lfd (linux for dummies) ##linux etc so if one is really overloaded try in another chan that what i do
[negative]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	mikebot, Seriously, Canonical has paid support, that's how they stay aflote.
[negative]	[03:19]	<gravemind>	how does mozilla feel about including firefox 3 beta 5 in a production release?

[positive]	[03:19]	<lewench>	Anyone know why my keyboards number to the right won't work? I have G15 keyboard and the new ubuntu
[negative]	[03:19]	<jstritar>	ffm_: yeah, well when they don't support the latest graphics cards you have to do that
[negative]	[03:19]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, what should have changed? i made no changes?
[negative]	[03:19]	<MewRS>	nucco: =( no chance of ressurect?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Pelo>	xyzpaw, go to wikipedia.com and search for ssh or secure shell
[neutral]	[03:20]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: hacking is not what you think it is...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<jstritar>	ffm_: they shouldn't pretend like you can upgrade
[positive]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Well, it can be used by malicious black-hat hackers.
[negative]	[03:20]	<Starnestommy>	xyzpaw: it's usually used for remote administration of servers
[neutral]	[03:20]	<xyzpaw>	can you use ssh to anonymously torrent
[negative]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	jstritar, They don't _pretend_.
[negative]	[03:20]	<Peddy>	﻿can someone tell me how to bring back window shadows in Hardy?
[positive]	[03:20]	<darkcrab>	mozilla has always encouraged people to use its test releases rather than its stable releases.
[negative]	[03:20]	<nucco>	MewRS: if the partitioning software can't access the drive, I can't think of what next to do, sorry
[neutral]	[03:20]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: you can use ssh to control rtorrent, for example
[negative]	[03:20]	<slashzul>	how do you add gnome desktop on a ubuntu server install? gdm?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	"jstritar, When you install ""community supported software"" it isn't supported by canonical."
[negative]	[03:20]	<gooody>	Pelo: pidgin doesn't support voice and videos yet. i'm not sure of the amsn yet.
[negative]	[03:20]	<Pelo>	xyzpaw, you are thinking of proxy servers , google for tor
[neutral]	[03:20]	<mikebot>	seriouslycgi: Thank you, I wasn't aware.
[negative]	[03:20]	<MewRS>	nucco: ill try the mkfs on entire drive, so..
[neutral]	[03:20]	<artenius>	lewench: hit numlock
[negative]	[03:20]	<d33d>	I need to fix my Firefox 3.05b flash, for some reason its like screwed up...In order to play any flash I have to click some stupid Circle with an arrow in it, and it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt...any ideas?
[negative]	[03:20]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: I'm not best sure, to be honest
[neutral]	[03:20]	<Zaqq>	installed heron using wubi ... installed nvidia drivers and some apps .. restarted ... booting halts with a (initramfs) prompt...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<mikebot>	ffm_: Right, but this is the free support channel, correct?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<Nutzebahn>	Pelo, yes, I did. Help?
[negative]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	slackd00d, just gnome, or the whole ubuntu desktop thing?
[negative]	[03:20]	<MewRS>	nucco: if everything is already messed up, there is nothing to lose, right?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	mikebot, Yes.
[neutral]	[03:20]	<nucco>	MewRS: my verdict though, is that the drive is history. and mkfs on the entire drive won't work either.
[neutral]	[03:20]	<osxdude>	!proxy
[positive]	[03:20]	<ubotu>	Many Ubuntu IRC channels prohibit access from !proxies such as !TOR and web (Java, etc) gateways due to a high level of abuse. You can however obtain a hostmask cloak: see @HLINK
[positive]	[03:20]	<jstritar>	ffm_: that doesn't mean ubuntu should upgrade without warning you it might break your entire system
[neutral]	[03:21]	<lewench>	artenius, ITS ON!
[negative]	[03:21]	<xyzpaw>	how do you use ssh to control rtorrent?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<MewRS>	nucco: Kingston R.I.P.
[neutral]	[03:21]	<w30>	xyzpaw: ssh is a secure version of telnet that can't be intercepted to get keystrokes for login names and passwords (greatly simplified)
[neutral]	[03:21]	<slashzul>	does GDM install add desktop to a server instsall?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<xrc>	you don't use ssh to control torrent
[negative]	[03:21]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: i'm pretty sure there are many tutorials out there on the internets. i never used rtorrent myself
[positive]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	jstritar, Uh, that's implicit in any upgrade. You should always back up data, but especially with system updates.
[negative]	[03:21]	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn,  that's where i look when I want software,  you can try google , Ihave no more suggestion but I've seen it mentioned on digg I think ,
[neutral]	[03:21]	<osxdude>	Lol, I have the same EXACT type of Kingston memory in the family computer right now
[negative]	[03:21]	<jstritar>	ffm_: do you know of way of trying to resolve upgrade issues?
[positive]	[03:21]	<MewRS>	nucco: no way to try to write a disklabel from term? :P
[negative]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Basically, it is easier for malicious people to hack into you if you use telnet.
[negative]	[03:21]	<josh04>	xyzpaw: You ssh in, run screen, open rtorrent, set it up, detach from screen and log out of ssh
[neutral]	[03:21]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: but rtorrent is not anonymous
[negative]	[03:22]	<totocool>	hi all I`ve just installed KDE 4 but the panew went away and don`t know how to start it
[neutral]	[03:22]	<Pelo>	slashzul, more or less, it,s part of a desktop
[negative]	[03:22]	<ffm_>	jstritar, What's the spesific issue?
[negative]	[03:22]	<totocool>	any ideas

[negative]	[03:22]	<lee3008>	anyone know if i will be able to use air snort with madwifi?
[neutral]	[03:22]	<ffm_>	!helpme > totocool
[positive]	[03:22]	<nucco>	MewRS: you can do that via an argument to mkfs, but that particular drive is hosed :)
[neutral]	[03:22]	<josh04>	MewRS: I presume parted can do it, but I don;t know how
[neutral]	[03:22]	<Pelo>	totocool, ask in #kubuntu or #kde
[positive]	[03:22]	<leo_rockw>	josh04: he's going to ask you what screen is now :-P
[positive]	[03:22]	<ffm_>	jstritar, Best way is a fresh install, but what's the broken package?
[negative]	[03:22]	<jstritar>	ffm_: i don't know b/c i closed the window and there's no log. but after restarting i have no network & the video is messed up
[negative]	[03:22]	<bjb1959>	Pelo, your suggestion didn't work. can't find anything in system>admin>users about logoff or shutdown and setting authorizations doesn't work either any more ideas?
[negative]	[03:22]	<jstritar>	ffm_: a lot of packages failed near the end
[negative]	[03:22]	<MewRS>	InGunsWeTrust: could not too! =(
[negative]	[03:22]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, for the last 5 months trying to get this,,, i keep feeling like its some stupid little thing that i miss but anyone else would have done as standard, did you see the SS, the icon with the meter-bar next to it?

[negative]	[03:36]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, I'm on my desktop with pci card been trying to get working
[positive]	[03:36]	<nucco>	my guess is: wubi copies some files to a place on your windows drive, then creates a boot loader entry, and prompts for reboot. when you reboot, you can launch the installer without necessarily modifying your bios.

[neutral]	[03:47]	<ToddEDM>	Legendario:  i dont think so
[negative]	[03:47]	<Dr_willis>	oddalot,  you may want to try audacious, or bmpx instead.   Compiling may take a bit of extra things needed to be installed first

[negative]	[04:01]	<Jordan_U>	thinkingfrog, It simply uses apt to download the corrosponding package, for gfx drivers it then changes the driver section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and when X starts it uses modprobe to load the module
[positive]	[04:01]	<josh04>	Bagelon1: It was my fault you crashed, I mucked up one of the commands

[negative]	[04:35]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: and then you can upgrade from synaptic
[negative]	[04:35]	<seamus7>	darkcrab ... it is not ... did you upgrade? maybe you had installed FF2 in a separate location?

[negative]	[04:36]	<darkcrab>	Jordan_1 yes , but I did not install it, thats the problem
[negative]	[04:36]	<tuchki>	hi. someone have a ati radeon express 200 installed correctly?
[negative]	[04:36]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: if it's not a fresh install then no. you just need to make sure you have the hardy repos for it so you can update when needed

[negative]	[04:37]	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, You can safely remove it if you want to, one possability I can think of is that you installed a package containing a firefox plugin which depends on FF2
[negative]	[04:37]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: how do i check to make sure i have the repos?

[negative]	[04:37]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: do you know what /etc/apt/sources.list is?
[negative]	[04:37]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: I think because Im a n00b I will put 64bit on stand by, so now I have to 1) fresh install 2) Figure out to make work dual core.
[negative]	[04:37]	<darkcrab>	OK jordan_1, I will check that now.
[negative]	[04:37]	<seamus7>	darkcrab: how do you know it's FF2?

[negative]	[04:38]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ahh i think so... is that the list where it shows ubuntu where to find updates?
[positive]	[04:38]	<seamus7>	darkcrab is FF3 there as well?
[positive]	[04:38]	<bazhang>	Wyzard: he has the 386 (not generic ) kernel
[neutral]	[04:38]	<josh04>	bagelong: it is
[negative]	[04:38]	<Wyzard>	ah
[neutral]	[04:38]	<Dr_willis>	TropicalDude,  check what kernel you are running also. I noticed on one machne i somehow had the 386 kernel installed when i needed the -generic kernel.
[negative]	[04:38]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: because I cant see dual activity CPU
[negative]	[04:38]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: yup either check that file or the medibuntu file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
[neutral]	[04:38]	<Assid>	Wyzard: not about makin it work.. but just  performs better

[positive]	[04:39]	<bjron>	lol, good thing I DL the xubuntu alt install disk - probably not a good plan to upgrade my ubuntu install from that :p
[positive]	[04:39]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: how :)? from synaptic?
[neutral]	[04:39]	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: strange.. technically 32 bit binaries should work on it
[negative]	[04:39]	<LoLeN_Original>	i had downloaded some packages (a LOT) from another computer, and then burnt them to a cd having used AptonCD; then i installed them at another system; and now Synaptic tells me that all of them are autoremovable. How can i fix it so that they are shown just installed?
[positive]	[04:40]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: that would be best choice yes--be sure it is the 24 and not the 22 however (if this is an upgrade and not a fresh install)
[negative]	[04:40]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: i know! that is why this problem is particularly annoying. zsnes is the only program that I want that i cant use! otherwise I love hardy (as I have loved every upgrade of ubuntu)

[negative]	[04:41]	<darkcrab>	just flash, and java, and thats about it.
[negative]	[04:42]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: nope, cuz it isnt a bug, there have been seperate 32 and 64 bit packages for zsnes since 6.10 I figured there was just something about the program that made it had to be specially compiled

[neutral]	[04:42]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid; good point
[positive]	[04:43]	<darkcrab>	no seamus7, this is an absolute default fresh install.

[positive]	[04:44]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: thanks , now trying
[neutral]	[04:44]	<seamus7>	darkcrab ... hmmm mystery ... just uninstall FF2 from synaptic .. or uninstall both FF2 and FF3 and then reinstall FF3 .. perhaps you inadvertently downloaded and installed an older beta versino of Hardy that had both

[neutral]	[04:48]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i think it's right... i was reading it and if i'm not wrong it says that i installed ubuntu from a 7.10 disc which is correct
[neutral]	[04:48]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: will require a restart
[positive]	[04:48]	<josh04>	bagelong: good luck :P
[negative]	[04:48]	<ruewan>	would uninstalling gksu be a bad thing
[negative]	[04:48]	<darkcrab>	well, I guess I will just try to uninstall firefox 2 then.
[positive]	[04:48]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: great!
[positive]	[04:48]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, well, it is certainly much harder but at the same point there is still _some_ paranoia that's needed to be secure ;)
[neutral]	[04:48]	<pebi>	nt
[negative]	[04:48]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: so you have gutsy?
[positive]	[04:49]	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, If you were being hacked they probably wouldn't change anything noticeable, this is a great answer because it both alleviates your fear that this is a sign of being hacked and makes you more paranoid at the same time :)
[negative]	[04:49]	<bjron>	has anyone got a link to the amd64 torrent?  I can't get to @HLINK . . it's being unresponsive

[negative]	[04:49]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: but the medibuntu repo is not in that list

[positive]	[04:50]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, no, i certainly agree that it's harder but randomly following directions that others give (sometimes even in this very channel) can lead to some negative effects, so it still takes a bit of common sense ;)
[negative]	[04:50]	<tuchki>	somebody know how to configure a grafic card ati radeon express 200 in hardy?

[negative]	[04:51]	<regis>	modprobe nvidia_new doesn't load the nvidia_new kernel module...i think i must edit the modules configuration files at /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic

[negative]	[04:52]	<seamus7>	Assid: good luck ... that can sometimes be tricky ...  do some searches via google and the ubuntu forums .. you need to make sure you have the graphic in the right location and there's a link which needs to point to it ..

[negative]	[04:52]	<dmsuperman>	What is the suggested tool for making a full disc image backup of my filesystem? It's roughly 6GB, so my plan is to then break it up into 2 pieces and burn to DVDs, or copy to an external hard drive
[negative]	[04:52]	<eaglestar83>	i was using ubuntu beta before should i do reinstall?   sometimes now firefox crashes
[negative]	[04:53]	<rich_freecomm>	maybe they should have an option to see size of how much needs to be downloaded and G/M/K/bytes downloaded
[negative]	[04:53]	<Assid>	err wait
[negative]	[04:53]	<Wyzard>	regis: turns out that's because the nvidia-glx-new package isn't seen as being available, because the installer apparently didn't download any package lists during installation
[negative]	[04:53]	<eaglestar83>	should i reinstall stable version?
[positive]	[04:53]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i think it wrked... right after i reinstalled it, a pop up for 5 updates came on with mediabuntu

[neutral]	[04:53]	<pokerfacepenguin>	ubuntung-pinoy: sounds like you are already commited.   been a while...u can probably do a google search to get a howto....basically, just point your repos to a different location...especially a more local one

[neutral]	[05:04]	<leo_rockw>	Ooglez: you can check out your card model with lspci
[negative]	[05:04]	<B_166-ER-X>	oh, Its either Hardy that still should be in Alpha Release, or 'me'    but its a fresh install. and almost everything is goin haywire.  I dont have any sound, A black screen on 1 on 2 reboot (besides of the Gdm login screen)   ect..ect. I need serious help (mostly with these 2 problems) I'm with Ubuntu since Hoary, and i never seen it this buggy.    :(

[neutral]	[05:04]	<jsoftw>	regis: so?
[positive]	[05:04]	<seamus7>	Luckrider: you are likely already in the final release ..
[neutral]	[05:04]	<bazhang>	dmsuperman: best to install from repos; if you *must* have it this second you might check at getdeb.net
[neutral]	[05:04]	<bagelong>	josh04: sure.  What  are my options from here do you think?
[negative]	[05:05]	<Scunizi>	I just installed server and on top xubuntu-desktop. I've got wired and wireless interfaces installed. Wired works. Wireless (Atheros AR5212/5213) isn't recognized or listed under network but shows up when with lspci in terminal.. how do I activate it
[negative]	[05:05]	<Vlet>	gapagos: oh, you'll probably have to do this first: chmod +x somebin.bin
[negative]	[05:05]	<jsoftw>	regis: if the user eve sudo's, then there you go, potential for problems right there.

[positive]	[05:05]	<seamus7>	Luckrider have you been getting updates on a daily basis ever since you installed the Beta? you can check System Monitor and it should say 8.04
[negative]	[05:05]	<bazhang>	JPSmon: that is not the way wubi works

[negative]	[05:05]	<jsoftw>	Look nevermind. You guys can hug your sudo
[neutral]	[05:06]	<josh04>	bagelong: You just need to get ndiswrapper working, which shouldn't be too hard. It's either the windows driver we've used or the ssb driver interfering, though i'm leaning towards the former

[neutral]	[05:06]	<roocraig>	anyone here help me with startup problem--i am a newbie and have trouble starting up ubuntu
[neutral]	[05:06]	<bazhang>	jsoftw: you may be comfortable with another distro if you love root so much; the 'ubuntu way' is sudo not root thanks
[negative]	[05:06]	<Flannel>	SimplePlan: Are you running update-manager, or apt-get or Synaptic?
[negative]	[05:06]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, Yeah, I was hoping to backup my harddrive overnight. It doesn't have it, and kdar.sourceforge.net won't load. Do you have any particular suggestions for full disc backup? I just need to backup /, minus a few dirs, and have it not follow symlinks to different filesystems
[negative]	[05:06]	<Vlet>	roocraig: specific questions are better
[negative]	[05:06]	<seamus7>	Luckrider; then you have been updating to the new release bit by bit everytime you had an update ... so there was no big update for you yesterday ... you had already arrived at the final

[neutral]	[05:28]	<Bassoon>	I can put the headphones in, but sound will still come out of the speakers AND the headphones.
[negative]	[05:28]	<kevykev>	Hi all, how do I get my sound to work?
[negative]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	oh wait! I had a couple of those  before. I forgot how long ago it was. It wasn't recent
[negative]	[05:28]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I suppose it depends on the exact definition of 'service', these scripts get run to start different things at init time.
[neutral]	[05:28]	<Drezard>	in regards to wireless connections...
[negative]	[05:28]	<Nikonlappy>	you can use root .. there isnt a big problem with it.. but its frowned upon with this OS
[negative]	[05:28]	<seamus7>	nano_ yes but it works in Ubuntu/gnome
[negative]	[05:28]	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  the update manager  never ask you to do a partial-upgrade?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<bazhang>	roocraig: can you startup in recovery mode?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<nano_>	seamus7: sweet,tnx
[negative]	[05:28]	<Geoffrey2>	why does it seem Ubuntu is no longer capable of automatically detecting wireless networks?
[negative]	[05:28]	<roocraig>	how do you do that?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	not recently, cvd-pr
[positive]	[05:28]	<shally87>	Nikonlappy: thanks
[negative]	[05:28]	<baudthief>	my install will likely break after a reboot, and I'm gonna need to start over - I've just backed up ~/home, are there any other dirs I need to back up that might contain personal files/info

[neutral]	[05:28]	<pawan>	how to install grahics driver nvidia
[positive]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	it has done partial-upgrades in the past
[positive]	[05:28]	<roocraig>	bazhang: do you think it is that graphics setting?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<Bassoon>	Geoffrey2, for me it seems to update slower.
[neutral]	[05:28]	<bazhang>	roocraig: get into the boot menu and choose it there
[negative]	[05:28]	<jamiejackson>	neil_d: if i add a script in there and make it executable, will just doing those two steps make it run at init time?
[negative]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	I can remember at least two. but not at any recent time around the release date
[negative]	[05:28]	<shally87>	bazhang: ok..thanks a lot.. and so how do i learn how to use the server version?

[neutral]	[05:28]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: Is there a rc.local there
[neutral]	[05:29]	<jamiejackson>	neil_d: yes
[positive]	[05:29]	<Bassoon>	It still detects them, Geoffrey2.
[neutral]	[05:29]	<Bassoon>	I'm also have problems getting Ubuntu to sense my headphone jack as filled.

[neutral]	[05:29]	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  that strange, cuz i used heron since beta but know say release version
[negative]	[05:29]	<IcemanV9>	backdraft: ufs ... dunno if it is supported in ubuntu
[negative]	[05:29]	<keycool1>	bazhang: did you see my paste?
[negative]	[05:30]	<Nikonlappy>	Geoffrey2: try the forums if you have no luck
[neutral]	[05:30]	<bazhang>	shally87: best to get a desktop and then install LAMP on top--especially as you are new to this; alternately you could install ubuntu-desktop to that (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) and work from there --if you do not wish to reinstall
[negative]	[05:30]	<Shadow420>	how can I fix my login screen it's too big for my monitor?
[negative]	[05:30]	<backdraft>	Tried that one unknown fs
[negative]	[05:30]	<chicobo329>	well I guess I could technically be on a release, but I had no major updates leading up to the release day
[negative]	[05:30]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I would sugjest you put your command in that rc.local file, maybe just something that wont cause trouble to start with.  like load a module you don't need as a test.
[negative]	[05:30]	<roocraig>	bazhang: i am going to try that and I will reenter the chat and tell you if there was any luck-ok?

[negative]	[05:31]	<keycool1>	oh right, wont past it in the channel anymore
[positive]	[05:31]	<xim>	my ? is if I backup my home dir and then reinstall linux and copy the home folder back in, will I need to manually reinstall all the packages, or is there a list of installed packages saved somewhere in the home dir that can be restored all at once?
[negative]	[05:31]	<bazhang>	keycool1: could you paste it to pastebin and then give me the link (please dont paste in the channel again thanks)
[negative]	[05:31]	<Nikonlappy>	B166erx: nothing quick here
[negative]	[05:31]	<seamus7>	maybe you just need to update grub ... first back up your menu.lst ... then sudo update-grub
[negative]	[05:31]	<roxygirl>	does anyone know anything about watching full episodes (ie. from abc.com) from canada....is it an isp problem or a linux incompatibility?

[neutral]	[05:32]	<dsas>	xim: You can use synaptic to create a list of packages which can then be installed once you have reinstalled
[positive]	[05:32]	<B166erx>	Nikonlappy, make it long then :) i'm at it for 6 hours now..still no answers .

[negative]	[05:32]	<seamus7>	chicobo329 maybe you just need to update grub ... backup menu.lst first ... then sudo update-grub
[negative]	[05:32]	<Makgyver>	ok I am burning the ISO in MAC OS X under Toast, lest see if this works for the PowerPC
[negative]	[05:32]	<Shpoo1>	I'm in the process of upgrading right now, and it's installing all the new packages. Quite of bunch of them couldn't be installed, whether due to missing dependencies, corrupt packages, or other reasons. Most were open office packages, but I can't remember all of them. Any have this problem?

[negative]	[06:24]	<milly1234>	well I found out how to solve my wireless problems with my linksys wireless pci card.... to not use the linux rt2500 drivers and use the windows wireless driver thing instead
[neutral]	[06:24]	<amenado>	mepatuhoo-> i dont know, i have not really looked deeply on what add/remove have compared to synaptic
[negative]	[06:24]	<dmsuperman>	amenado, Right, which I figured would either take all the mounted drives with it or it wouldn't. It's obviously not, because then the dump would be well over 200 GB. However, / is only using 4.5GB, so I'm just wondering where the extra 15GB of data comes from
[positive]	[06:24]	<bazhang>	khaotik: you may want to hang on to gutsy a bit longer then ;]
[negative]	[06:24]	<Scunizi>	tomoyuki28jp: yes.. but if you do you're opening your machine to the outside world.. I don't know the specifics of how to just that it can be done

[negative]	[06:24]	<nickrud>	tomoyuki28jp install gdmsetup, and on the security tab you can set the auto logged in user

[negative]	[06:32]	<amenado>	orudie_-> not necessarily true always
[negative]	[06:32]	<dmsuperman>	amenado, alright, read it. My only idea so far is to use the nofollow flag when executing so it won't follow symlinks, but other than that I'm still drawing a blank as to where it gets the extra data. it's not copying the mounted drives, because it would be much bigger, but it's also not just copying the files from the partition, because it would be smaller

[negative]	[06:56]	<Koheleth>	Baby_Shambl3s, arnt you meant to be in jail?
[negative]	[06:56]	<sam__>	so does that mean my CPU is doing too much work?
[neutral]	[06:57]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Koheleth: o_o dont spread it around
[negative]	[06:57]	<androver>	kind of, yeah.  lemme find you a reference that tells you how to fix it.
[negative]	[06:57]	<dmsuperman>	Alright, I'm now backing up my full partition, excluding any extra data (such as /proc, /media, etc.) where are all the main places ubuntu uses for extra data that I can delete? For example, before backing up windows I would flush the temporary internet files, and the prefetch, to save room
[neutral]	[06:57]	<androver>	sam__: try this: @HLINK
[negative]	[06:57]	<Claan22>	"how do I use the 'make' command?  the instructions I'm following say ""It can be done by make, so only type in make into the console, when you are in the driver main directory. ""  I have the directory open in the file browser, then I switch to the terminal and type 'make', and it says that there's no target"
[neutral]	[06:58]	<androver>	Claan22: you have to cd to that directory in the console first
[neutral]	[06:58]	<Koheleth>	prolly got net access in nick
[negative]	[06:58]	<Claan22>	androver: ah.  how do I do that?
[negative]	[06:58]	<McGod>	How do I create a startup script
[negative]	[06:58]	<unop>	Claan22, you probably need to run ./configure first -- but do read the INSTALL/README file first, it varies from package to package
[neutral]	[06:58]	<McGod>	I need to startup my network
[neutral]	[06:58]	<androver>	"just type ""cd <directory here>""..."
[positive]	[06:58]	<albech>	does ubuntu support diskless install? booting from a nfs mount?
[neutral]	[06:58]	<unop>	albech, sure
[negative]	[06:58]	<androver>	"if you want to get to /usr/local/bin/foo, you type ""cd /usr/local/bin/foo"""
[positive]	[06:59]	<unop>	without the quotes :)
[negative]	[06:59]	<OldSocks>	I have a problem. I installed 8.04, and the only thing that makes me ticked off is I can't access my D:\ drive. I installed using Wubi, and I installed ubuntu onto my D drive. However when I boot up ubuntu, I can only access my C drive. Anyone know a fix?
[negative]	[07:00]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	"Claan22: it dont work like that you have to go into the directory using cli (command line) so it would be cd /""than directory path > once inside the director make wait for it to make and than sudo make install (make sure you have buil-essential installed)"
[negative]	[07:00]	<Claan22>	YES it seems to be working, thanks guys
[neutral]	[07:00]	<gooody>	is there any way to edit icon settings in ubuntu gutsy?
[positive]	[07:00]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: you should be able to get at the D drive ehhh look in
[neutral]	[07:00]	<androver>	no prob
[positive]	[07:00]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Err well is drive D a second partition on the first physical disk - or is it its own physical disk
[neutral]	[07:00]	<cool>	gooody, System>Preferences>Appearance
[positive]	[07:00]	<seamus7>	gooody you can install different icon sets in Appearances ... you change individual icons by right-clicking an app and choosing properties
[positive]	[07:01]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: it is a second partition on my main disk. I was able to access D with 7, but with Hardy, I don't see it.
[negative]	[07:01]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: like unop said you might have to run ./configure first than make, you can also try make check just incase to see if you have all dependencies
[negative]	[07:01]	<sam__>	weird, i cant open CPU frequency scaling monitor in my taskbar
[neutral]	[07:01]	<sam__>	how can i find it
[negative]	[07:01]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Is it NTFS or FAT32 ?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: NTFS logical
[negative]	[07:01]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: brb - something is wrong with my client - gotta reboot it
[neutral]	[07:01]	<unop>	Claan22, it's always recommended you read the INSTALL/README files before making assumptions and running ./configure or make
[negative]	[07:01]	<led3234>	how do i install the propietery (sp?) drivers?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<cool>	sam__, you installed it?
[negative]	[07:01]	<Claan22>	how do I use ./configure?  make is giving me 'error 2', so I figure that's the problem
[negative]	[07:01]	<androver>	"sam__: it doesn't show up when you right-click on the taskbar and say ""add to panel""?"
[positive]	[07:01]	<Pinky>	whew, I finally got ubuntu 8.04 installed :)
[negative]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	Ok well that was odd
[negative]	[07:02]	<Claan22>	unop:  I'm following instructions on the internet, they just tell me to make it
[negative]	[07:02]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently
[neutral]	[07:02]	<sam__>	add new item?
[negative]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	all my responses decided to be white
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	anyway
[neutral]	[07:02]	<androver>	"it's called ""add to panel"" on mine, I'm on hardy."
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: So NTFS partition... ok.. so you should be able to hit it at /media/sdb I think
[positive]	[07:02]	<seamus7>	Any strong reason to do a fresh install rather than an upgrade?
[negative]	[07:02]	<OldSocks>	Baby_Shambl3s: yea I know that, but I can't access my D drive, even though its called something else.
[negative]	[07:02]	<unop>	Claan22, trust the instructions in the INSTALL file over anything else - they are probably more authoritative than anything else
[negative]	[07:02]	<cool>	sam__, This would help --> @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:03]	<gooody>	seamus7: i want to change the way my icon display in the desktop. i don't like the way pdf, images and other files displayed as thumbnails like on my desktop.
[negative]	[07:03]	<Daniel15>	"Hi everyone... I just upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04 and keep getting ""You are not allowed to access the system configuration"" when I try to go to items in System -> Administration (eg. Networking)"
[negative]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: Hmm, I'll give it a try. Got to reboot into ubuntu.
[negative]	[07:03]	<Daniel15>	Any ideas how to fix that?
[positive]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	Thanks.
[negative]	[07:03]	<oddalot>	"ahhh...here is the problem  ""checking whether build environment is sane... yes  ""   <--lol, this should say no"
[negative]	[07:03]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: first thing you need to do is go into the folder and check Readme file and Install file if it is provided or go to the site and check documentations to see which commands you need, have you even got a compiler?
[positive]	[07:03]	<cool>	gooody, you can find more eye candy on gnome-look.org
[negative]	[07:03]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: It might not be automatically mounted, if that's the case - come back and we can walk through it
[neutral]	[07:03]	<seamus7>	gooody how would you like your icons to appear?
[neutral]	[07:03]	<Koheleth>	xfce programs hide behind the tool bar, anyway to make it rest at the top of the tool bar like in a mac
[negative]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	cpudan80: alright thanks. I'll reboot now.
[neutral]	[07:04]	<gooody>	seamus7: just like pdf licons like in windows
[neutral]	[07:04]	<sam__>	when i right click on my panel i dont get those options
[positive]	[07:04]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: in windows you wont be able to access d:\ as it is in linux partition m$ windows wont read it but ubuntu will read windows and other partitions
[negative]	[07:04]	<sam__>	is it because im using Xubuntu?
[negative]	[07:04]	<androver>	sam: yup, that's it.
[negative]	[07:04]	<Claan22>	baby_shambl3s: there's a readme, but it doesn't explain installation at all.  there's no install file.  I don't know if I have a compiler.  I'm following instructions here: @HLINK which I guess it the website
[positive]	[07:04]	<gooody>	seamus7: the default setting consumes a lot of space on my desktop
[positive]	[07:04]	<oddalot>	"w00t, i think it's compiling....IT""S ALIVE"
[negative]	[07:04]	<androver>	you'll have to do CPU scaling some other way.
[neutral]	[07:05]	<seamus7>	gooody you don't want the icons to preview their content ... you just want the pdf symbol to appear as the icon?
[positive]	[07:05]	<Daniel15>	"gooody, you just want normal icons to appear, and not the preview? Go to a folder and click Edit ->Preferences, change the ""Show thumbnails"" item on the Preview tab."
[neutral]	[07:05]	<gooody>	seamus7: yes
[negative]	[07:05]	<koomber1664>	um, how do I get my waste bin back on a panel?
[neutral]	[07:05]	<sam__>	damn xfce
[negative]	[07:05]	<seamus7>	gooody read what Daniel15 wrote
[neutral]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	koomber right click, add to panel
[negative]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	i had to restart once
[neutral]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	maybe it's a bug
[negative]	[07:06]	<Daniel15>	"Can anyone help with my problem? I just upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04 and keep getting ""You are not allowed to access the system configuration"" when I try to go to items in System -> Administration (eg. Networking)"
[neutral]	[07:06]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 did you Unlock the window?
[negative]	[07:06]	<androver>	sam: what kind of CPU do you have?
[negative]	[07:06]	<DON^SRK>	Hi Alls...Pls tell me how can i use paltalk on ubuntu ?
[positive]	[07:07]	<gooody>	thanks guys. it works.
[negative]	[07:07]	<Daniel15>	seamus7, what do you mean? I just click that option in the menu and that error pops up. The network config doesn't even load.
[neutral]	[07:07]	<sam__>	Intel Celeron (its probably 4 years old or so)
[neutral]	[07:07]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 are you set up as the administrator ... your username that is?
[negative]	[07:07]	<sam__>	HP Computer (if thats what u wanted to know)
[positive]	[07:08]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: its quite straight forward i think first two commands as I believe you did get the latest stable drive for you oyu cna even use command locate i.e. locate /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211
[negative]	[07:08]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211
[neutral]	[07:08]	<Daniel15>	Yeah, it worked fine in Ubuntu 7.10, but hasn't worked since I updated to 8.04
[negative]	[07:08]	<androver>	"ok, 2 suggestions.  first, apt-get install cpudyn.  if that doesn't help, apt-get install cpufreqd and google ""cpufreqd"" to configure it."
[neutral]	[07:08]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 look in UsersandGroups and see what privileges your username has?
[negative]	[07:09]	<oddalot>	awww man still didn't work
[negative]	[07:09]	<MrRoboto>	how can I save my external drive, it is not being recognized by ubuntu!!!! ??

[negative]	[07:09]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 do you have another username you can login as?
[positive]	[07:09]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: its quite straight forward i think first two commands as I believe you did get the latest stable drive for you if you follow that it should work easily
[negative]	[07:09]	<Daniel15>	seamus7, I'll try to run it from a terminal and see if there's any output
[negative]	[07:09]	<Daniel15>	Nope, no other users

[negative]	[07:10]	<Starnestommy>	DON^SRK: I'm not sure if it's possible

[negative]	[08:57]	<joe_>	merlin_: and then look for the source code they want
[negative]	[08:57]	<magnetron>	Repsa_Jih: some sort of rsync, i would say

[neutral]	[08:58]	<bvk>	hi, is there a way to install .debs into $HOME of non-root users ?
[negative]	[08:58]	<androver>	MrRoboto: it depends on what kind of errors you're getting.  it works if your hard drive is clicking.  paste some dmesg output into a pastebin and i'll look at it.
[negative]	[08:58]	<joe_>	merlin_: then read the last error code when you do the sudo sh nvidia*
[neutral]	[08:58]	<Taejo>	androver, now I've got @HLINK
[negative]	[08:58]	<joe_>	merlin_: it will tell you how to tell it where the file is, there is some syntax I forget

[negative]	[09:07]	<ubotu>	nick_: gnome is a project that provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for end-users, users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.
[neutral]	[09:07]	<martin_>	First, it does not appear the Upgrade menu
[neutral]	[09:07]	<nick_>	so what are andrake and all taht
[neutral]	[09:07]	<newscane>	ubuntu is installed on an IDE drive, attached to an IDE controller
[positive]	[09:08]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	icesword: it should, shouldn't it.. prob is it's not :-/
[neutral]	[09:08]	<toplok>	I am having all kind of troubles from 7.10 to 8.04
[negative]	[09:08]	<martin_>	"I've tried to force it to install using the  command gksu ""sh /cdrom..."""
[positive]	[09:08]	<Dr_willis>	nick_,  the desktop is easyally changed. Some disrtos default to gnome, some default to kde, others default to.. well others..
[neutral]	[09:08]	<newscane>	new drive is a 500 gig sata, attached to a sata controller, which i know linux has recognized (showed up in lspci)
[neutral]	[09:08]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: nvidia-cg-toolkit?
[negative]	[09:08]	<martin_>	But it was useless
[negative]	[09:08]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	toplok: info on that error would help
[negative]	[09:08]	<ferris_>	toplok, i don't know how to do that, but I am sure others will send it to you...
[positive]	[09:08]	<jintxo>	"Hello there. Was woindering if somebody knew a way of making ubuntu (8.04) not use compiz and just use metacity. I have ""No desktop effects"" selected but it's still running compiz and gtk-window-decorator. cheers :-)"
[positive]	[09:08]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  nope. thats not it. :) i did need that tool for somthing.. but thats not the nvidia-xconfig tool
[neutral]	[09:08]	<nick_>	d_wills: don;t understand o well
[neutral]	[09:08]	<toplok>	please pastebin /boot/grub/menu.lst, thanks
[positive]	[09:08]	<newscane>	now, it goes through bios, shows the first controller, the drive, second controller, the drive, splash screen again, and then i get a blinking cursor.
[neutral]	[09:09]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: nvidia-xconfig is what I need?
[neutral]	[09:09]	<orudie_>	this ubuntu channel keeps getting bigger and bigger
[positive]	[09:09]	<Dr_willis>	nvidia-settings - Tool of configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver AND nvidia-xconfig - The NVIDIA X Configuration Tool
[positive]	[09:09]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  i use both of those. :)
[negative]	[09:09]	<baudthief>	"help... I added a NIC to my ubuntu box, and now the 'protected' samba shares it hosts arent accessible, I just get ""the specified network password is not correct"""
[negative]	[09:09]	<newscane>	i disconnected the SATA drive, and booted with no problem.  any ideas?
[negative]	[09:09]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: its asking to remove the glx-new
[negative]	[09:09]	<razel>	i just installed hardy but my wireless lan wont work...
[neutral]	[09:09]	<Gnine>	its easier to run xserver fix from recovery mode menu
[neutral]	[09:10]	<simplexio>	newscane: did it work before ?
[negative]	[09:10]	<toplok>	ubuntung-pinoy, first my grub menu.lst was not properly updated so now I don't have access to the new kernel
[negative]	[09:10]	<orudie>	newscane, maybe your computer is trying to bood from the 500 gig
[negative]	[09:10]	<toplok>	the desktop effects are gone
[negative]	[09:10]	<razel>	anyone who knows more about wireless?? :(
[neutral]	[09:10]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  i dont knwo about that. I installed all 3 at the exact same time.  and this was a few weeks ago.
[neutral]	[09:10]	<newscane>	i looked at the bios... the IDE controller card is set to boot before the sata card
[negative]	[09:10]	<PolitikerNEU>	hi all, I got the following problem: My CPU is overheating and even maximum throttling (powersave - 2x1000 instead of 2x1667 Mhz and 75% throtteling so the CPU has effective 2x250 MhZ) doesn't help
[negative]	[09:10]	<martin_>	ubuntung-pinoy: In fact, nothing happens when I enter the command in terminal to upgrade from the CD
[negative]	[09:10]	<simplexio>	newscane: i thibk that you have wrong boot order
[negative]	[09:11]	<androver>	razel, i might...what's the problem?
[negative]	[09:11]	<martin_>	Just nothing
[neutral]	[09:11]	<ferris_>	toplok, @HLINK
[negative]	[09:11]	<orudie>	newscane, that doesnt work sometimes i had the same problem before
[positive]	[09:11]	<newscane>	so how do i fix it? :)
[positive]	[09:11]	<toplok>	ferris_, thanks a lot
[neutral]	[09:11]	<ferris_>	toplok, np
[positive]	[09:11]	<razel>	androver: i bought a new laptop with vista pre installed and i dont want vista i like ubuntu and then i installed hardy and now fixing problems
[negative]	[09:11]	<newscane>	everything seems to be correct
[positive]	[09:12]	<guest59>	Hello,I installed the new xubuntu 8.04 on an old machine. Everything works well, except shutdown doesn't work: The computer doesn't turn off completely, it always hangs when the progress bar is down.
[neutral]	[09:12]	<newscane>	overall boot order is cd > removable media > hd > network
[negative]	[09:12]	<androver>	razel: ok, that makes sense, what's wrong with the wireless?  does it show up under ifconfig?
[neutral]	[09:12]	<newscane>	within HD, it's add-on cards > IDE > sata
[neutral]	[09:12]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: Ok, I have all three installed, and when I run nvidia-xconfig all it gives me is a corepointer error for the keyboard and mouse
[negative]	[09:12]	<orudie>	newscane, i'm not too sure, but there is a chance you should configure grub boot loader
[negative]	[09:12]	<simplexio>	newscane: where did you but that grub
[neutral]	[09:12]	<newscane>	grub is on the IDE drive
[positive]	[09:13]	<newscane>	it boots fine when i unplug the sata drive
[neutral]	[09:13]	<ditya>	l,l,l,l,;,
[negative]	[09:13]	<simplexio>	newscane: then it should be first
[neutral]	[09:13]	<jhaarman>	how to check which version a package is (apt commandline)
[positive]	[09:13]	<ferris_>	toplok, this is from a dual boot system so be sure to edit what you don't need out of it
[neutral]	[09:13]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: The CoreKeyboard device was not specified explicitly in the layout;
[neutral]	[09:13]	<joe_>	         using the first keyboard device.
[neutral]	[09:13]	<icesword>	jhaarman, apt-cache show package
[negative]	[09:13]	<simplexio>	newscane: do you have anything linux related stuff on sata ?
[neutral]	[09:13]	<newscane>	it is before the sata card...
[negative]	[09:13]	<razel>	androver: i typed ifconfig and what should i look?
[negative]	[09:14]	<newscane>	sata is a brand new drive, fresh out of the box
[neutral]	[09:14]	<icesword>	!apt howto
[negative]	[09:14]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about apt howto - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[09:14]	<androver>	razel: paste the results into the pastebin
[negative]	[09:14]	<Tidus>	sorry about that guys... had to refresh my nick list and forgot to part most of my channels
[negative]	[09:14]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,   I dident have that issue. if you just installed the nvidia-glx drivers. You 'should' be able to restart the X server and it 'should' see the nvidia card and start using it. You MIGHT have to enable it in the restricted-managers tool
[negative]	[09:14]	<newscane>	only one sata drive on the sata card
[neutral]	[09:14]	<androver>	!pastebin | razel
[neutral]	[09:14]	<ubotu>	razel: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[neutral]	[09:14]	<simplexio>	newscane: it worked when you used livecd ?
[positive]	[09:14]	<toplok>	ferris_, yep, I use five different OS here :)
[neutral]	[09:14]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: lemme restartx and try that, brb
[negative]	[09:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	I wanna see some install horror stories..lol, maybe we need a channel devoted to that
[neutral]	[09:15]	<newscane>	i put the xubuntu cd in, said boot from HD, and with the sata drive plugged in, i get a blinking cursor
[negative]	[09:15]	<hangthedj>	I just upgraded to 8.04, does this mean I have to run firefox 3, cause i don't want to.
[neutral]	[09:15]	<icesword>	jhaarman, @HLINK
[negative]	[09:15]	<guest59>	Can anybody help me have  the computer turn off again completely?
[neutral]	[09:15]	<Gnine>	!apt | icesword
[positive]	[09:15]	<ubotu>	icesword: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: @HLINK - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome) or !Adept (KDE)
[neutral]	[09:15]	<newscane>	unplug the sata drive from the card, and i can boot normally w/ no problems
[neutral]	[09:15]	<jhaarman>	icesword: thx.
[positive]	[09:15]	<toplok>	going to see if I can boot with the new kernel...
[neutral]	[09:15]	<androver>	guest59: sudo poweroff
[positive]	[09:15]	<hangthedj>	when i uninstall it, it uninstalls ubuntu-desktop and firefox, reinstalling these two automatically installs firefox-3
[negative]	[09:15]	<orudie>	newscane, are you getting any errors ? what is exactly happening when you connect your new sata drive ?
[positive]	[09:15]	<newscane>	with the sata drive in, this is what i get as i boot:
[negative]	[09:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	hangthedj: it doesn't remove ubuntu desktop.. thats just a meta-ackage
[neutral]	[09:15]	<simplexio>	newscane: does it boot from livecd ?
[neutral]	[09:15]	<astro76>	hangthedj: you can apt-get install firefox-2
[positive]	[09:16]	<icesword>	don't know ubuntu has it
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	hey
[negative]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	can someone please help me?
[negative]	[09:16]	<jhaarman>	I am using libpam-encfs and it seems to be failing after upgrade to 0804. More people have experience with that??
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	I've killed my grub boot loader
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	I'm currently on the Live CD
[negative]	[09:16]	<simplexio>	newscane: if it boots from livecd and sata work under it, you have messed grub or kernel
[negative]	[09:16]	<IndyGunFreak>	not very smart.
[neutral]	[09:16]	<androver>	ubuntu: so reinstall it?
[negative]	[09:16]	<razel>	androver: i did whats next?
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	how would I reinstall it?
[negative]	[09:16]	<androver>	razel: gimme the url for the paste
[neutral]	[09:16]	<jhaarman>	ubuntu_ on wiki is info on that
[negative]	[09:16]	<hangthedj>	it says firefox-2 is already the newest version, and if i run firefox-2 it loads firefox-3 beta 5
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	would sudo apt-get install grub --reinstall work?
[negative]	[09:17]	<ferris_>	IndyGunFreak, my install was horrible.... well, the install on two machines were flawless on 8.04, but the configuring the wireless took me about 20 minutes, after I pulled my head out of a dark place.... on the old pc, no problems at all.
[positive]	[09:17]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  i had that issue for a while also.. then it fixed itself..
[neutral]	[09:17]	<razel>	androver: im using a wired internet right now...
[negative]	[09:17]	<rothchild>	I've got a borked install of msttcorefonts that I can't seem to get rid of or fix can anyone help?
[negative]	[09:17]	<hangthedj>	Dr_willis,  how did it fix itself?
[negative]	[09:17]	<newscane>	orudie: i get the gateway splash, then it recognizes the IDE card and the IDE drive, then the sata card and the sata drive, then a blinking cursor.  it also made some drive noises (sounded like the floppy and the ZIP drive going).  no error msg
[negative]	[09:17]	<IndyGunFreak>	ferris_: hmm, mine was fairly smooth on my PC and Laptop.... i set my wireless up the same way I did in gutsy(with a madwifi patch because my device gets misdetected).
[negative]	[09:17]	<androver>	razel: i need you to tell me the URL that the pastebin gave you for what you pasted
[negative]	[09:17]	<guest59>	Androver: I'll try. Please wait a moment.
[positive]	[09:17]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  it just started working. :) its working now for me here..
[negative]	[09:18]	<IndyGunFreak>	actually, i don't think i had any problems on either machine..lol
[positive]	[09:18]	<hangthedj>	ok, i'll wait it out :p, thanks.
[negative]	[09:18]	<orudie>	newscane, and then what?
[negative]	[09:18]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: No dice, it started back with nv drivers
[neutral]	[09:18]	<hangthedj>	haha
[neutral]	[09:18]	<tcpdumpgod>	XMMS1 isnt in Hardy?
[positive]	[09:18]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  just ran  firefox-2   and its running the older firefox.
[neutral]	[09:18]	<tcpdumpgod>	Only XMMS2?
[neutral]	[09:18]	<orudie>	newscane, freeze ?
[positive]	[09:18]	<pclynch>	anyone have any knowledge about adding the boot option for xp in ubuntu grub?
[positive]	[09:18]	<newscane>	"simplexio -- i have not tried to boot right off the cd, with the sata drive plugged in.  booting w/ the CD in, and then choosing ""boot from hard drive"" gives the blinking cursor"
[neutral]	[09:18]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  check the restricted-manager tool, be sure you have 'use nvidia' checked.
[neutral]	[09:18]	<razel>	androver: @HLINK
[positive]	[09:18]	<hangthedj>	Dr_willis, it looks like it just fixed itself ;)
[negative]	[09:18]	<newscane>	orudie: nothing happens.  it just blinks.
[neutral]	[09:18]	<nick_>	is 8.04 lts good im upgading to it
[negative]	[09:18]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj, ! how did it do that! :0 heh heh...
[neutral]	[09:18]	<rothchild>	the output is here @HLINK
[neutral]	[09:18]	<simplexio>	newscane: try it.. connect sata and boot from livecd
[positive]	[09:19]	<Dr_willis>	nick_,  you will have to try it and decide for yourself I guess. :)
[negative]	[09:19]	<hardy-wtf>	this live cd is making my lcd monitor black out like every three seconds what do i do about it?
[neutral]	[09:19]	<newscane>	brb.. lemme try
[neutral]	[09:19]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: System > Hardware drivers?
[negative]	[09:19]	<androver>	razel: ok, so the wireless card isn't showing up under ifconfig.  what kind of computer do you have?  make and model?
[negative]	[09:19]	<hangthedj>	running firefox-2 runs firefox-3, but if you launch it from the internet menu it runs firefox-2
[negative]	[09:19]	<nick_>	dr_wills: ok only been on 7 for about 2 days
[negative]	[09:19]	<IndyGunFreak>	i don't like Firefox's new download manager.. the old one was better(when doing multiple downloads)
[neutral]	[09:19]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: I used to have restricted drivers as an option, but its gone now
[negative]	[09:19]	<rothchild>	I think it's because I had privoxy installed but I don't any more
[negative]	[09:19]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  no idea. Im not using gnome.. and i dont have the menus memorized
[negative]	[09:19]	<monkeybritches>	hardy-wtf: Is it the screensaver?
[neutral]	[09:19]	<orudie>	newscane, does the grub boot loader shows up ?
[negative]	[09:19]	<nick_>	wheres somewhere i can look at all the gnome software

[negative]	[09:20]	<rothchild>	nick_ how about packages.ubuntu.com
[neutral]	[09:20]	<jube>	Anyone know where the settings for import-photos (when you plug your camera into USB import-photos pops up)?
[neutral]	[09:20]	<razel>	androver: i have a dell inspiron 1525 laptop
[negative]	[09:20]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	anyone know what to make of this? audio/x-asf-unknown decoder plugin
[negative]	[09:20]	<orudie>	newscane, my guess is that you have to try and get the grub configured for this new hard drive and for your system hard drive
[neutral]	[09:20]	<acidicbase>	anyone have a detailed changelog for 8.0.4 release?
[neutral]	[09:21]	<hardy-wtf>	no it is not the screensaver
[neutral]	[09:21]	<androver>	razel: follow these directions: @HLINK
[positive]	[09:21]	<ferris_>	IndyGunFreak, they were both smooth. I was impressed that it was the easiest installs ever. I have literally installed over 1000 times. From win95 to vista, BeOs, RH, GENTOO, Debian (many versions of it) but Ubuntu 8.04 was incredibly easy. I thought they did a particularly nice job on the manual partitioner
[neutral]	[09:21]	<hardy-wtf>	i can duplicate it
[negative]	[09:21]	<timandtom>	8.04 isn't recognizing my wireless card automagically and giving me the option to install the drivers like 7.10 did. How do I find/install drivers for it? They're restricted drives. Wireless card is: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX (rev 02)

[negative]	[09:43]	<`rob->	is that possible? did hardy take out my monitor?
[negative]	[09:43]	<MrRoboto>	sjovan: I know it's a dumb question, but I want to install another distro ... something maybe ..more challenging but tight, I was thinking about slackware
[neutral]	[09:43]	<drwx>	Hi I have got a big problem with my wifi card broadcom 4306, it dont works on hardy. someone has the solution?
[positive]	[09:43]	<timandtom>	astro76: And, the light USED to work on 7.10
[neutral]	[09:43]	<androver>	oholiks: try running it from the command line and see what happens when it crashes
[negative]	[09:43]	<livingdaylight>	magnetron, yes, upgrade doesn't appear to have deleted my installation of ubuntu-restricted
[negative]	[09:43]	<ferris_>	bigtimer21, that should get you going.
[negative]	[09:43]	<IndyGunFreak>	64bit is so so much better faster, etc forget the fact its a pain in the ass to get anything to work! it rocks!
[positive]	[09:43]	<oholiks>	androver: i'm not a beginner ;)
[positive]	[09:43]	<sjovan>	MrRoboto: try debian. that's what i'm thinking about doing later on :)
[positive]	[09:43]	<androver>	oholiks: then don't ask me anything :)
[positive]	[09:43]	<oholiks>	androver: =)
[negative]	[09:44]	<MrRoboto>	sjovan: Yeah, was thinking about debian
[neutral]	[09:44]	<oholiks>	androver: thanks anyway
[negative]	[09:44]	<negge>	IndyGunFreak I haven't noticed any real increases in speed since I switched to 64-bit
[neutral]	[09:44]	<astro76>	MrRoboto: checkout Archlinux
[neutral]	[09:44]	<`rob->	omg my monitor was like 400 bucks
[positive]	[09:44]	<negge>	but it's still the way to go
[neutral]	[09:44]	<IndyGunFreak>	negge: that comment was in jest, and i completely disagree that its the way to go
[neutral]	[09:44]	<`rob->	i hope it is just hot in here
[neutral]	[09:44]	<`rob->	lol
[positive]	[09:44]	<negge>	IndyGunFreak of course it's what everyone should be using when everyone has a 64-bit processor
[negative]	[09:45]	<eeboy>	Basic linux question... in terminal how do I change to a directory on another partition. Similar to 'cd F:' in dos.
[negative]	[09:45]	<negge>	otherwise we'll be stuck in the 32-bit age forever...

[positive]	[09:45]	<IndyGunFreak>	negge: i disagree.. i've got 2 64bit PC's, use 32bit on both.
[negative]	[09:45]	<oholiks>	eeboy: no such things as drive letters, you mount a disk under a directory
[neutral]	[09:45]	<astro76>	"eeboy: ""extra partitions"" are typically mounted under /media"
[neutral]	[09:45]	<sjovan>	eeboy: that's if you have mounted it. can you se the disk in system monitor?
[negative]	[09:46]	<harfg>	In future If you want to test properly *gee I could of told you gst was utterly fucked* affecting some key areas, some one relevant can get my email addy in pm.. and let me know ..
[positive]	[09:46]	<askand>	Have ubuntu stopped slowly destroying laptopharddrives with the release of Hardy?
[negative]	[09:46]	<IndyGunFreak>	`rob-: why are you installing edgy?
[neutral]	[09:46]	<androver>	by the way if anyone runs plone, the upgrade to hardy will break it.  beware.
[neutral]	[09:46]	<cvd-pr>	IndyGunFreak,  the DMa
[negative]	[09:46]	<negge>	IndyGunFreak think about it, if everyone who could would use 64-bit OSs, then we'd have great drivers in a matter of weeks
[neutral]	[09:46]	<negge>	and all programs would suddenly support 64-bit
[negative]	[09:46]	<MrRoboto>	astro76: archlinux looks cool
[negative]	[09:46]	<dystopianray>	askand: no, but it's easily fixed
[negative]	[09:46]	<robinreborn>	does anybody know why installing updates on dell computers causes me to get a non-graphical command prompt?
[negative]	[09:46]	<`rob->	IndyGunFreak: hardy wiped out my /
[negative]	[09:46]	<IndyGunFreak>	negge: but thats just not the reality of it, and i hate dealing w/ the constant issues of dealing w/ 64bit... whne its actually ready i'll use it.
[neutral]	[09:46]	<harfg>	so to release seems utterly against the ethos of debians workingness
[positive]	[09:46]	<eeboy>	Cool... I see it under /mount. Gotta get used to everything appearing as files. Terminal highlights some of them in different colors and backgrounds. Is there a listing of the meanings somewhere?
[negative]	[09:46]	<askand>	﻿dystopianray: not for me sadly, tried everything on the net :(
[negative]	[09:46]	<`rob->	IndyGunFreak: but maybe it was bad installation media (to be fair)

[neutral]	[09:51]	<rothchild>	bigtimer121 you might want to install compiz config manager it will let you adjust all the eyecandy settings
[negative]	[09:51]	<androver>	robinreborn: if it doesn't, you need to reconfigure X, which is done with some command that I don't remember right now but I'm sure someone else does...anyone?

[negative]	[09:53]	<androver>	robinreborn: there are a few things that might have happened.  your X settings could be messed up, meaning that you need to reconfigure X.  @HLINK

[negative]	[10:24]	<jerry13>	"I can acess them through ""computer"" anyway."
[positive]	[10:24]	<Dr_willis>	ditoa,  why is it divx specific? :) i tend to use gmplayer for my needs.
[neutral]	[10:24]	<oddalot>	best dilbert strip EVER -> @HLINK
[positive]	[10:24]	<Jagged|>	chivaknievel: nah it's about releasing that no ones listen to you and desiding to fix it yourself :P
[negative]	[10:24]	<MttJocy>	RudyValencia, I believe that the difference between /dev/hdx and /dev/sdx drives is how they are physically connected to the system (and therefore how they are seen from the kernel's perspective) however I could be wrong and I'm not sure which one refers to what maybe someone else could confirm that (and perhaps explain better than I can)
[negative]	[10:24]	<timandtom>	rothchild: :( No luck. And I made sure to leave it on when I restarted
[negative]	[10:25]	<RudyValencia>	OK
[positive]	[10:25]	<ditoa>	just because everything i have is divx/xvid :)
[negative]	[10:25]	<lartza_>	oddalot:Yea it would be pretty simple. It should search all .jar ended files and position the filename after href= correctly, but I'll do it hand
[negative]	[10:25]	<blame>	vistakiller: do I have to remove the drivers currently installed priror to executing envyng?
[neutral]	[10:25]	<vistakiller>	no

[negative]	[10:26]	<chivaknievel>	but i just expect more i guess
[negative]	[10:26]	<Dr_willis>	MttJocy,  that used to be how it worked. but now the changes in the kernel make most/all ide drives also show up as sd devices.
[neutral]	[10:26]	<chivaknievel>	from ubuntu
[negative]	[10:26]	<lartza_>	odda lot: I knew that and wondered why you started to talk about java, but there are only like 50 files left after all crap deleted
[negative]	[10:26]	<MttJocy>	Dr_willis, Oh right, didn't know that.
[negative]	[10:26]	<vistakiller>	chivaknievel wait then for updates
[negative]	[10:26]	<chivaknievel>	i guess thats a good plan
[neutral]	[10:26]	<Dr_willis>	MttJocy,  its due to cleanup of the ide and drive subsystem code from what ive read.

[neutral]	[10:27]	<astro76>	!debian | RudyValencia
[positive]	[10:27]	<ubotu>	RudyValencia: Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See @HLINK - Remember, !repositories meant for Debian should NOT be used on Ubuntu!
[negative]	[10:28]	<chivaknievel>	but all of these problems are the sort of thing that will make it fail

[positive]	[10:28]	<Dr_willis>	RudyValencia,  with each new release of ubuntu -  - the differances grow and grow. it seems. I think its beyond a 'fork' stage now.

[negative]	[10:29]	<lartza_>	"with java jar i get Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: jar"
[negative]	[10:29]	<MttJocy>	You know, I wonder why, especially when there is a new distribution update that puts a lot of pressure on the update servers (or it seams to be, my computers online update tool is downloading them now) have they ever considered making it so that the online distribution upgrade tool has the option to fetch the distribution update via torrent rather than hitting the update servers directly, I am sure given the option quite a few users would choose it and
[negative]	[10:29]	<MttJocy>	it could help reduce the peak load the update servers get on release day, or is there some reason this is technically not possible?
[neutral]	[10:30]	<RudyValencia>	"So Ubuntu might now be considered ""offspring of Debian""?"
[neutral]	[10:30]	<xipi>	hi
[negative]	[10:30]	<pteague_laptop>	astro76> ah, ok thanks... i'm trying to run icewm on my laptop as it's a bit low on resources... unfortunately wireless doesn't seem to auto connect unless i log into gnome
[negative]	[10:30]	<IndyGunFreak>	amerio: i have tat same device working w/ madwifi.. no probs here, are ou sure the ESSID of the network you want is broadcasting?
[negative]	[10:30]	<xipi>	what does the address 192.168.0.0/24 mean?
[neutral]	[10:30]	<chivaknievel>	you can upgrade via the install cd
[neutral]	[10:31]	<astro76>	xipi: /24 means a netmask of 255.255.255.0

[negative]	[10:31]	<amerio>	IndyGunFreak: yeah im very sure , the day before yesterday I had gutsy with wireless working and detection is ok ! i didnt edit any of router settings , when I installed hardy yesterday it just stopped
[negative]	[10:31]	<lartza_>	is there anyway to run hone jar progs on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[10:31]	<xipi>	astro76: so all ips from 192.168.0.0 - .255?
[negative]	[10:31]	<astro76>	xipi: so that's specifiying a network from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 with a netmask I mentioned
[neutral]	[10:31]	<lartza_>	hne > phone

[negative]	[10:32]	<IndyGunFreak>	amerio: hmm, very strange.. sorry, no logical explanation
[positive]	[10:32]	<oddalot>	24 is a number of bits?
[neutral]	[10:32]	<chivaknievel>	ubuntu will forget all your old settings because its really awesome like that and doesnt care about things like that
[neutral]	[10:32]	<astro76>	oddalot: indeed

[negative]	[10:32]	<Trewas>	according to bug 208666 there should be fixed audacious in hardy-proposed, but unless I am looking at wrong places hardy-proposed is currently empty... so is it available somewhere?
[negative]	[10:33]	<eeboy>	Another basic linux question... I've made a shell script that I want to run on start up. How do I accomplish this?
[negative]	[10:33]	<asc>	I would like to use ALSA for audio, but ALSA output does not work. How can this be fixed?
[negative]	[10:33]	<timandtom>	amerio: I'm seeming to have the same problem with a different card.
[negative]	[10:33]	<lartza_>	could someone write me script to delete all files under 35kt from a folder?
[neutral]	[10:33]	<roulet-wilson>	I have a problem with installing ubuntu i run the live cd and run it in live mode but the screen has lines through it and part of the right side is on the left

[neutral]	[10:33]	<Ubuntu-Noob>	if i upgrade to the latest ubuntu, will i lose all my current files?

[neutral]	[10:33]	<eeboy>	when user logs it
[negative]	[10:33]	<IndyGunFreak>	amerio: i hve no clue.. sorr
[neutral]	[10:34]	<Ubuntu-Noob>	im on 7.10 at the mo
[neutral]	[10:34]	<astro76>	Ubuntu-Noob: it should work fine, but as always backup your files if they are important
[neutral]	[10:34]	<linux__alien>	i installed Ubuntu 8.04 everything works expect the NVIDIA driver. when i installed the Nvidia driver i just get a white screen. I use a NVIDIA Ge-Force 8400 M GS Card in my Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop
[negative]	[10:34]	<linux__alien>	is there a wor around for this?
[negative]	[10:35]	<MttJocy>	timandtom, Regards your wireless card no longer being detected after the distribution upgrade, perhaps you should submit a bug report with the details of your card etc, check nobody else has already posted one though.
[negative]	[10:35]	<lartza_>	could someone write me script to delete all files under 35kt from a folder?
[positive]	[10:35]	<timandtom>	amerio: I've been asking in here for a while too, no one seems to have any idea :( I'm thinking about just going back to 7.10 for a bit, especially if it turns out to be  Ubuntu specifically, not just the card not working at all(Haven't tried on XP yet)
[positive]	[10:35]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, i have the same card, only the non-mobile version, and the restricted drivers manager should handle them fine
[neutral]	[10:35]	<astro76>	lartza_: that should be one find command
[positive]	[10:35]	<astro76>	lartza_: well, find piped to xargs
[negative]	[10:35]	<elmargol>	Someone knows how I can see if an application uses XV?
[neutral]	[10:35]	<Exteris>	but linux__alien you should pastebin the contents of: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[negative]	[10:35]	<timandtom>	MttJocy: Thanks, already did though. But, that doesn't help me get it working NOW :(
[negative]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i just get a white screen ok  i ll do that i ll enable that driver and then paste the contents of pastebin
[negative]	[10:36]	<amerio>	timandtom: I had that problem in gutsy and spent like a week to fix it , i dont want to suffer again
[neutral]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, currently i am using X without xorg.conf i ve delete the file
[negative]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, is it possible to paste it now ? or should i enable it again and paste it?
[negative]	[10:36]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, you should have renamed it
[positive]	[10:36]	<timandtom>	Well, I'm out for the night. I'll try again tomorrow if it works in WinXP... Or just reinstall 7.10 if not. Farewell.
[neutral]	[10:36]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, uhm no you need the log with the errors in it
[positive]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i still have a backup though
[negative]	[10:37]	<lartza_>	astro76: Kinda amateur and didn't find script from google.
[positive]	[10:37]	<timandtom>	amerio: Ah, that sucks. Everything worked perfectly right out of the box for me with 7.10. It was really a great way to get introduced to Linux.
[neutral]	[10:37]	<eeboy>	Dr_willis, when a user logs in is what I am after
[negative]	[10:37]	<chivaknievel>	this is such a mess, if upgrading is going to cause so many problems to so many people, what is the point of the every 6 month upgrade?
[negative]	[10:37]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, so should i rename the file and again try logging into X and then copy the xorg.log and paste it?
[negative]	[10:37]	<MttJocy>	timandtom, To be honest not sure how to help you there, presumably something in the upgrade has broken the support for that card I guess, maybe someone else who has your card who is cleverer than me might figure out a workaround till it is fixed with some luck (either that or it gets fixed soon)
[negative]	[10:37]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, restore the backup, restart the xserver, it fails, then copy the log to another file and paste it
[positive]	[10:37]	<linux__alien>	done will do it now

[positive]	[10:38]	<amerio>	timandtom: everything works perfect on hardy too , but I always have wireless issues .. whats your card anyway?
[neutral]	[10:38]	<tcpdumpgod>	Or when you drag and drop a theme file on the appearance manager, it doesn't ask you to apply the new theme?

[negative]	[10:43]	<tcpdumpgod>	bigtimer121, did you use the .bin file provided by nvidia.com or did you install it through APT?
[neutral]	[10:43]	<bigtimer121>	APT
[neutral]	[10:43]	<tcpdumpgod>	alienseer23-eee it probably screwed your xorg.conf up.
[negative]	[10:43]	<emorris>	if I want to upgrade from gutsy to hardy using a cd, do I need a desktop or alternate cd?
[neutral]	[10:44]	<tcpdumpgod>	desktop emorris
[positive]	[10:44]	<emorris>	﻿tcpdumpgod: thanks
[negative]	[10:44]	<howlingmadhowie>	lartza_: the easiest way would be to install  a mobile phone emulator
[neutral]	[10:44]	<tcpdumpgod>	bigtimer121, you should be able to just uninstall all the nvidia packages installed VIA APT then.
[neutral]	[10:45]	<alienseer23-eee>	tcpdumpgod: suggestion?
[positive]	[10:45]	<Exteris>	Are there panel applets to display the output of a command?

[neutral]	[11:18]	<MajSh>	emorris: trying now. thanks
[negative]	[11:18]	<tcpdumpgod>	tell me if that returns anything.
[neutral]	[11:19]	<TerrorBite>	oddalot, IMO you only need sudo for the make install stage

[positive]	[11:23]	<vistakiller>	linux-alien this is a general problem
[negative]	[11:23]	<El1>	so just install nvidia-glx for the time being so you can run in proper resolution
[negative]	[11:23]	<TerrorBite>	not enough disk space to do an upgrade. Using an eeepc with a 4GB SSD

[neutral]	[11:23]	<tcpdumpgod>	vallhalla81, im going to private message you.
[positive]	[11:23]	<vistakiller>	i think there will be a bug report

[negative]	[11:27]	<Dr_willis>	fserve,  You might want to install the samba-doc package and check out the samba books it contains. I dont know the answer off hand. but i bet its in there. ) was thinking the 'hidden' share feature was a rather insecure gimmic really last i read about it.  Linux samba browsers can find/see them just fine since they are really not hidden.

I had the same trouble with 7.10 but was hoping that 8.04 would fix the problem. When I click on the volume control I get the following error: The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that...
[negative]	[12:14]	<gavinreddrop>	...you don't have a sound card configured.                After that error is displayed I get this error when I click on it: No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.     I have searched though the forums with no avail and now I am here....  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated..
[neutral]	[12:14]	<LebLinux>	zeno: no it doesn't do it ... still kept back
[negative]	[12:14]	<sofiankr1>	zeno: there's just one problem, the wireless thing on my computer is not lighted up...

[neutral]	[12:15]	<zeno>	sofiankr1: not sure, maybe it just lights up when you are connected?
[positive]	[12:16]	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, if you need help finding out which one to use, go to #gnome and #kde and ask them why you should use it
[positive]	[12:16]	<livingdaylight>	dreamcoder, its a tough choice i agree
[negative]	[12:16]	<dreamcoder>	ok
[negative]	[12:16]	<sofiankr1>	dreamcoder: I tried Kubuntu, really did not like it
[negative]	[12:16]	<koudelka>	livingdaylight, no, but if you insert cd's or something you change the preferred application menu. but for opening a file with a special program you rightclick and go to preferences
[neutral]	[12:16]	<silentlamb>	i prefer gnome

[positive]	[12:23]	<koudelka>	linux__alien, try and uninstall the nvidia driver and reinstall it, alternatively you can use envyng to install the latest nvidia driver
[negative]	[12:23]	<silentlamb>	ok
[negative]	[12:23]	<crashanddie>	joemac, at what point does it stop working, does it still boot (electrically), do you get to Grub, maybe even a splash screen ?
[positive]	[12:23]	<errpast>	silentlamb, about 2 years. It's great, but the hardware stuff can be very frustrating
[negative]	[12:23]	<linux__alien>	koudelka, did that too but no use
[negative]	[12:23]	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: Do you know what chipset your card has?
[negative]	[12:23]	<emorris>	﻿gavinreddrop: can you not get any sound, have you tired testing the sound from system>prefs>sound
[positive]	[12:23]	<crashanddie>	joemac, boot on a livecd, mount the disk, and edit /etc/fstab until it works
[neutral]	[12:23]	<Ceox>	no
[positive]	[12:23]	<linux__alien>	koudelka, the problem still exists
[negative]	[12:23]	<joemac>	I get the splash screen then something calling itself ASH

[negative]	[12:24]	<joemac>	tried /dev/hd1
[neutral]	[12:24]	<errpast>	silentlamb, it's come a huge way in three years
[negative]	[12:24]	<linux__alien>	koudelka, is it possible to get the 7.10 driver ?
[positive]	[12:24]	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: Does the device show on the NetworkManager in the top right corner?
[negative]	[12:24]	<zombie_monkey>	"so guys, I have ""PAND_ENABLED=1"" in /etc/default/bluetooth but there's only ""auto eth0"" in /etc/network/interfaces ... and runnign pand from the command line does absolutely nothing with any kind of parameter. but it does give me sugegstions for parameters and the man page is there :/"

[neutral]	[12:33]	<errpast>	huibuh, good point.  It was Intel graphics I think.
[neutral]	[12:33]	<koudelka>	linux__alien, yes, but you have to do it from commandline, and close gnome and xserver

[negative]	[12:35]	<errpast>	huibuh, do you run a laptop. I've just bought a Lenovo. Like I say, it's pretty good with 8.04, except sound. I think that will be a half hour task with backports to get working.

[negative]	[12:45]	<errpast>	Bits, thanks.  the EEEPC 9 inch looks fun. By getting a low end Lenovo for $600 (another $100 for 4 MB), I figure I can spend another $300 or $400 on the EEEPC
[neutral]	[12:45]	<joemac>	comes up: fdisk not found
[positive]	[12:45]	<Bits>	errpast: sound and graphics worked fine out of the box. networking took a bit of tweaking and advanced graphics took a bit of xorg tweaking. fan still needs to be tweaked and instability occurs with advanced desktop effects (something with the window titles)
[negative]	[12:45]	<errpast>	Bits, I'm waiting for the 9 inch model though.  It's only 2 pound!
[neutral]	[12:46]	<crashanddie>	joemac, djeezus
[neutral]	[12:46]	<ghostlines>	does leaving modules in your kernel slow you down, or only leave the kernel a bit larger?
[neutral]	[12:46]	<zeno>	-g2g nite all
[negative]	[12:46]	<errpast>	Bits, interesting. When you say fan tweaking, are you talking BIOS?
[negative]	[12:46]	<crashanddie>	ghostlines, the whole point of using modules is that they're *not* in the kernel
[neutral]	[12:46]	<zeno>	materthron: try the version referenced in post 35
[negative]	[12:46]	<MttJocy>	joemac, Just do that command I said, and tell me what it comes up with
[neutral]	[12:46]	<zeno>	lates
[negative]	[12:46]	<errpast>	Bits, I think my Lenovo 3000 needs a fan tweak, but my googling tells me maybe BIOS related.  I haven't dug in there yet.  It makes this louzy clicking sound. I thought maybe it was broken
[positive]	[12:46]	<errpast>	Bits, But when I GG, I see others have fan issues

[negative]	[12:50]	<livingdaylight>	someone said something to me? (can't scroll back up far enough)
[neutral]	[12:50]	<grrr>	errpast, the nonfreeflash plugins dont works too.
[negative]	[12:50]	<joneskoo>	how can I debootstrap ubuntu 8.04 with only using Debian Etch?
[negative]	[12:50]	<errpast>	Bits, Smart move. It's easy to get fanatical about it. I know I do. But in the end, as long as I have net, Firefox, xchat, vim I'm pretty happy

[neutral]	[12:52]	<oholiks>	joneskoo: try getting debootstrap package from ubuntu packges and extract the template file from it
[negative]	[12:52]	<joneskoo>	oholiks: is the template file the only difference?
[neutral]	[12:52]	<joemac>	  /dev/hda1 not found
[neutral]	[12:52]	<crashanddie>	joemac, good, good
[negative]	[12:52]	<joneskoo>	oholiks: in the man page it warns that debian stable's debootstrap might be too old for debian sid, presumably that applies for ubuntu too
[negative]	[12:52]	<errpast>	grrr, that's the link I found yesterday. BUT....the link isn't working today. I didn't succeed getting Flash with 8.04, but I didn't try. I was just researching a few things that didn't work, and was going to try them all today
[neutral]	[12:52]	<joemac>	Good?
[neutral]	[12:52]	<oholiks>	joneskoo: used to be atleast
[negative]	[12:52]	<crashanddie>	joemac, well at least it's consistent
[neutral]	[12:52]	<joemac>	lol
[negative]	[12:52]	<samalex>	anyone familiar with netatalk?  I'm trying to copy data from OSX to Ubuntu Server 8.04, but Netatalk is passing the free space of the user's home directory and not the HD mounted within.
[neutral]	[12:53]	<oholiks>	joneskoo: pin unstable debootstrap and use that one?
[negative]	[12:53]	<MttJocy>	Okay I'm lost, unless there is something else a hard drive can show up as, seams it is not detecting it.
[neutral]	[12:53]	<joneskoo>	oholiks: perhaps. I haven't did pinning so I'll just try the template first
[negative]	[12:53]	<samalex>	... the /home partition only has 5 gigs of free space but I've mounted a 300 gig HD within my home directory to backup stuff to.  OSX shows only 5 gigs free so when I try to copy stuff into this 300 gig mounted drive, says not enough space
[negative]	[12:53]	<crashanddie>	joemac, I think you should try to get a CD/DVD and try again, because your install seems pretty damaged

[neutral]	[12:55]	<errpast>	Anyone have a Lenovo with sound problems on 8.04?
[positive]	[12:56]	<huibuh>	:D
[positive]	[12:56]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it assumes his other computer works, and he cares about not downing the servers more
[negative]	[12:56]	<Drezard>	whats mozilla 3 beta 5 installed as? like what package?
[negative]	[12:56]	<thebigham>	how do i auto mount the windows partition on startup?
[positive]	[12:57]	<joemac>	thank you for your time crashhanddie and mttJocy, I will see what I can do with a torrent downloaded cd:)
[negative]	[12:57]	<Drezard>	whats mozilla 3 beta 5 installed as? like what package?
[neutral]	[12:57]	<crashanddie>	dreamnid, firefox or firefox-3.0
[neutral]	[12:57]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Yeah, now if only their desktop upgrade tool would let you select torrent instead of HHTP
[neutral]	[12:57]	<MttJocy>	HTTP*
[neutral]	[12:57]	<MajSh>	thebigham: just add it to the /etc/fstab (and install ntfs-3g if it's needed)
[positive]	[12:57]	<Drezard>	crashanddie, thanks
[negative]	[12:57]	<Drezard>	crashanddie, neither worked :(
[negative]	[12:58]	<crashanddie>	Drezard, what are you trying to achieve ?
[positive]	[12:58]	<grrr>	errpest, thank you, nice day all
[neutral]	[12:58]	<Daisuke_Ido>	immortality!
[neutral]	[12:58]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, we talked about that on #ubuntu-release-party 'bout that issue the day before yesterday
[positive]	[12:58]	<Drezard>	crashanddie, dont worry found it :) thanks
[neutral]	[12:58]	<daedra>	has anyone in here got mpd running in hardy?
[negative]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Oh?
[neutral]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, But they decided against it?
[negative]	[12:59]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, there are in fact a few problems with it
[neutral]	[12:59]	<g0th>	when I run make-kpkg binary-arch in linux-2.6.24/ I get at the end:
[negative]	[12:59]	<bumcheekcity>	hi guys. quick question. can you use wubi to install the x64 version of ubuntu on x86 Vista? obviously, I have a 64-bit capable CPU
[negative]	[12:59]	<g0th>	Makefile:526: /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.24/arch/xen/Makefile: No such file or directory

[neutral]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Such as?
[negative]	[13:00]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, first of all, we would need to take a few choices, like do we make one big package with everything in it for the upgrade, or one .torrent per package ?
[neutral]	[13:00]	<daedra>	paste!|goth
[neutral]	[13:00]	<daedra>	oops
[negative]	[13:00]	<g0th>	hmm and I can't set the background anymore somehow
[neutral]	[13:00]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, both are good, because one is better for the server, but the other is better for maintainability
[neutral]	[13:00]	<daedra>	!paste|g0th
[neutral]	[13:00]	<ubotu>	g0th: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[negative]	[13:00]	<g0th>	how do I change the background?
[negative]	[13:00]	<blame>	how do you manage services on ubuntu?
[negative]	[13:00]	<MajSh>	please anyone... i really need to get the TV OUT working.. it's the last thing that sends me back to windows.. :(
[positive]	[13:01]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, then of course, it would mean that the devs need to push yet another package, and pushing a release on bittorrent is way harder than just working behind the projectors and syncing HTTP/FTP mirrors
[neutral]	[13:01]	<g0th>	@HLINK
[negative]	[13:01]	<g0th>	ubotu: that's the whole output
[negative]	[13:01]	<g0th>	daedra sorry
[negative]	[13:02]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's cheaper, but it's harder, and we've seen it during the last couple days, even the tracker got downed by the amount of users
[neutral]	[13:02]	<Ceo1>	hey
[negative]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, imagine what it would be if everyone did the same ? Also, bittorrent doesn't allow you to use local mirrors, so those who don't care would be using one download for each computer, instead of setting up a local mirror and downloading it once
[neutral]	[13:03]	<Ceo1>	brakkvatn
[neutral]	[13:03]	<Ceo1>	r u there?
[negative]	[13:03]	<g0th>	how do I change my background image?
[neutral]	[13:03]	<joomla_user>	g0th, what are you building ?
[negative]	[13:03]	<m0ns00n>	Anyone knows why eclipse can't connect to the net in hardy?
[neutral]	[13:03]	<g0th>	linux-2.6.24
[neutral]	[13:03]	<joomla_user>	g0th, rightclick on desktop
[negative]	[13:03]	<g0th>	I don't know why xen is mentioned
[neutral]	[13:03]	<m0ns00n>	Not installed from packages..
[positive]	[13:03]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, One .torrent per package probably would not really be the best idea to be fair, torrent tends to not work as efficiently with many small files, however if you put it in one big torrent it would work better, and it is still possible to selectively download the .debs inside it (Azureus has the option I think all Bit Torrent clients do)
[negative]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's a nice idea, but it's pretty much flawed from the start, and we'd need to hack it big time before we could do something with it
[neutral]	[13:04]	<lamothe>	beardos: And there you are!
[negative]	[13:04]	<g0th>	joomla_user: hmm I don't get anything if I right click
[negative]	[13:04]	<g0th>	I don't have nautlius installed
[neutral]	[13:04]	<g0th>	nautilus

[negative]	[13:04]	<gavin__>	Hi, I have just upgraded to 8.04 and for some reason Ubuntu will no longer recognize my sound card (Intel 82801H - ICH8 Family (rev 02)), can anyone help
[negative]	[13:04]	<g0th>	if I install nautilus my system gets so slow so since I never use it I removed it
[neutral]	[13:04]	<joomla_user>	g0th, what window manager do you use
[negative]	[13:04]	<zyx386>	why the forefox is standard work offline under Hardy?
[negative]	[13:04]	<crashanddie>	"MttJocy, yeah, but ""selectively downloading the .debs"" is pretty much counter productive, because you don't have it, and you don't share with others"

[positive]	[13:06]	<g0th>	joomla_user: I also installed drapes
[neutral]	[13:06]	<joeamined>	how can i install ubuntu from the live cd without launching gnome ?
[neutral]	[13:06]	<silentlamb>	errpast so wat do u do wit ur linux box
[negative]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I think there's something else that worries them, we've all seen how updates get distributed on WoW, or any other update manager that uses bittorrent
[positive]	[13:06]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Talking about local mirrors, I wish that squid didn't decide not to cache .debs if it had cached them would save having to download them all again for the other machine :|
[negative]	[13:06]	<gfather>	guys anyone here has a vpn for god sake ?? ??
[neutral]	[13:06]	<Yapsey>	joeamined: there's an alternate install CD
[negative]	[13:06]	<silentlamb>	want to learn perl and python very important in security
[positive]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, like I said, it could be an awesome idea, but it really needs some work, I might write an essay about it or something ;)
[negative]	[13:07]	<joeamined>	yapsey: is it possible from the live cd ?
[negative]	[13:07]	<Yapsey>	don't know. maybe the second option in the booting menu?
[positive]	[13:07]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I have a local mirror on my home network, I've uploaded more than 80Gig on release day ;)
[neutral]	[13:07]	<cd-r>	gavin__ : check here @HLINK
[neutral]	[13:07]	<Oetzi>	hi there

[neutral]	[13:07]	<Oetzi>	i just upgraded to hardy and facing some problems now
[neutral]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	first thing
[neutral]	[13:08]	<Yapsey>	jdolan: just using a network source?
[positive]	[13:08]	<gavin__>	the strange thing is that it works perfectly on 8.10
[negative]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	ssh-agent seems not to work
[negative]	[13:08]	<jdolan>	Yapsey, sure, how do i tell it to do that?
[negative]	[13:08]	<jdolan>	just remove the CD from my sources list?
[positive]	[13:08]	<b33r_>	does anyone know where's iced tea java cache directory and how to change it?
[negative]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	yeah how can install ubuntu on and empty system with a bad crcrive
[positive]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	always get an error
[negative]	[13:08]	<MttJocy>	(Unless there is some way to force it to cache them, but bit late now, already done the download on the one machine anyway, although if there was a way to force it would save wasted downloads when both computers have to download for the most part the same updates even with normal updates)
[positive]	[13:08]	<Yapsey>	jdolan: place a # in front of your CD is the easiest way I guess :)
[negative]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
[negative]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	is there any solution to that problem
[negative]	[13:08]	<zyx386>	can every one tell me that?
[neutral]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	seen the pendrive
[positive]	[13:09]	<jdolan>	Yapsey, hah, why didn't i think of that?  (just disabling the source), hehe :)
[positive]	[13:09]	<Yapsey>	you're welcome :>
[neutral]	[13:09]	<silentlamb>	but the all need a functional OS to work
[negative]	[13:09]	<joneskoo>	oholiks: hmh. I don't even see the script for 8.04 in ubuntu debootstrap. isn't it called hoary?
[neutral]	[13:09]	<joneskoo>	no hardy
[negative]	[13:09]	<MttJocy>	Is that possible? to force squid to cache .debs instead of ignore them? (I assume the file names do change with each version of the package right)
[negative]	[13:09]	<zyx386>	why is FF Work offline standard?
[negative]	[13:09]	<g0th>	so how do I change my background without nautilus?

[positive]	[13:10]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, but you should be able to temporarily add .debs to the caching abiliy
[positive]	[13:10]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, you will need to highly up the cache limit, though
[neutral]	[13:10]	<zyx386>	Yapsey, th firefox is standard Work Offline?

[negative]	[13:11]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I thought there was

[negative]	[13:37]	<cherva>	please help when I apt-get glipper the install completes normally and after that there is no glipper installed
[positive]	[13:37]	<lamothe>	daniel_hh: If you haven't already, can I recommend logging out/in.  Maybe gconf is stuck.
[negative]	[13:37]	<mut80r>	mluser-home: as far as I know.
[negative]	[13:37]	<GoodJob>	my system has the keyboard layout set to some other than the USA... in the system the behaviour is correct, but in the Login Window the keyboard layout is messed up (the USA layout is loaded)... how can i make my system's keyboard layout to be the same for the Login Window?

[neutral]	[13:37]	<GoodJob>	i have hardy
[negative]	[13:38]	<jarle>	"dirtyrice: so the program started from the script is not ""GOD"""
[negative]	[13:38]	<Wibble->	I've got a real problem with Hardy - my sound card just stopped working! It was working this morning and now doesn't.  No additional software was installed AFAIK.  Pulse audo appears to be running and hasn't put anything in syslog.
[negative]	[13:38]	<idyllic>	silent: back up your xorg.conf first in case there is problem later
[neutral]	[13:38]	<mut80r>	chazco: kernel improvements I think. happens to me too. then it goes to the normal loading bar
[negative]	[13:38]	<IntangibleLiquid>	how do I define Fn F9 to be the touchpad enabler/disabler?

[positive]	[13:38]	<chazco>	mut80r - It doesnt do it on my desktop though... seems odd to have a slower bootup on a more powerful machine
[neutral]	[13:38]	<joeamined>	hi
[negative]	[13:39]	<joeamined>	is it possible to install ubuntu desktop edition without launching gnome ?

[negative]	[13:39]	<g0th>	hmpf, not much help here :(
[negative]	[13:39]	<r3d3y3>	What does this error mean ... checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
[negative]	[13:39]	<joeamined>	rsk: there's no way to do it with the desktop iso ?
[negative]	[13:39]	<rsk>	nope
[negative]	[13:39]	<mut80r>	chazco: I don't exactly know what the sideways scrolling bar is there for. disabling the splash screen, all I see is a 10-second or so pause before it gets going.
[neutral]	[13:40]	<silent>	idyllic: i dont think so
[negative]	[13:40]	<theone_>	joeamined, do you mean booting straight to a command line?
[negative]	[13:40]	<joeamined>	theone: i mean installing ubuntu with command line
[negative]	[13:40]	<silent>	idyllic: just installed this ubuntu and put xchat on it, nothing else
[positive]	[13:40]	<chazco>	mut80r - Unsure what its for here also... on mine if i boot in recovery mode I see it pause over ACPI/SATA initalisation...
[negative]	[13:40]	<joeamined>	because i don't have enough RAM (only 256), so i can't install with live cd booted
[positive]	[13:41]	<idyllic>	silent: System - Administration - Hardware Driver =D enable the restrictive driver
[negative]	[13:41]	<dirtyrice>	then you must use alternate cd like the guy above said
[negative]	[13:41]	<mut80r>	chazco: are you using a SATA drive ?
[neutral]	[13:41]	<joeamined>	ok thanks
[neutral]	[13:41]	<chazco>	mut80r - Yep... but my desktop is also which doesnt have this issue
[negative]	[13:41]	<dirtyrice>	i had to use it when installing on a 550
[negative]	[13:41]	<theone_>	joeamined, you should just pick the install without booitng to the live cd option
[neutral]	[13:41]	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: I allread restarted X and the computer
[positive]	[13:41]	<mut80r>	chazco: would be best not to mess with anything for now then until someone can tell us what it's there for. ;)

Generally, turning the machine off and back on fixes the problem.  I have had people suggest the psu but it is a 450w and personally I think it is working fine.  Someone suggested I write down the exact points at which it hangs.

[negative]	[14:32]	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I intalled Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (for my ATI radeon sapphire x1550 video card, I think). I installed those drivers and a blinking icon told me to reboot my pc.

[negative]	[14:35]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: can you login to the remote box?
[negative]	[14:35]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: I did all that already, was wondering if thre is a known problem with kubuntu 8 and compaq computers
[negative]	[14:35]	<duncan>	Lieutenant: then maybe the download was wrong, i think, before you burn somethink to cd, you try it, for example, you can try this boot image in virtualbox
[negative]	[14:35]	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, I thought you meant set up port forwarding on your ubuntu computer (as you did ask in the ubuntu channel)

[neutral]	[14:35]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: check the md5sum of the iso.
[negative]	[14:36]	<johnmike>	MttJocy: ha ha, sorry! I asked here because maybe there's an Ubuntu specific site addressing it
[negative]	[14:36]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: even getting there takes about a minute, usually it logs in within a second
[negative]	[14:36]	<akt>	Hi. This must be a FAQ but I'm worndering what's the advantage/disadvantage of using ubuntu server instead of Debian?

[neutral]	[14:36]	<virus92ita>	anyone can help me with video card drivers?
[negative]	[14:36]	<mut80r>	johnmike: some routers won't activate port forwarding until you disable DHCP. annoying, I know.
[neutral]	[14:37]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: heh, so general connection issues, not specifically with ping... what actual type of connection to the internet does it have?
[positive]	[14:37]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: it passed the md5sum on my xp box
[negative]	[14:37]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable, about 15 mbit down, 1.5 mbit up. usually no problems at all
[positive]	[14:37]	<akt>	Both will provide latest apps and anyway both the same Linux kernel. using the same aptitude
[neutral]	[14:37]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: never mind the previous
[neutral]	[14:37]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: are there are boxen on the same connection you can check?
[negative]	[14:37]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: straight to modem, no router (anymore). possible that it was hacked somehow?
[negative]	[14:37]	<akt>	what's the difference?
[negative]	[14:38]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: nope
[neutral]	[14:38]	<akt>	As a server.
[negative]	[14:38]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: could the system be the problem? 1.2GHz celeron, 256MB Ram, 120Gig HDD
[negative]	[14:38]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ooooh....never tried that disabling that!
[negative]	[14:38]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: hmm well it's a bit difficult to say that's it definitively a problem with ubuntu
[neutral]	[14:38]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I can go overthere which I will do even though it's a bit of a hassle.. what should I check for first, behind the thing?
[negative]	[14:38]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: what's the Process Name u get ?
[negative]	[14:38]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[negative]	[14:39]	<mut80r>	johnmike: unless you know how to set a static IP and have the DNS addresses, DON'T disable DHCP.
[neutral]	[14:39]	<Jarwo>	sweety_girl
[negative]	[14:39]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: if you can go over there and access the box, then you can do a lot of general connection tests
[negative]	[14:39]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Yes, you should have ~350MB of Ram to do the ive cd.
[negative]	[14:39]	<Fritzel>	danbhfive, this is an interesting rts, from the first few minutes in the tutorial it seems like there isnt' much micro-management to worry about
[negative]	[14:39]	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: i dont know process name, thats the thing...
[negative]	[14:39]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: i just wanted to install it
[negative]	[14:39]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: the disk does work on my laptop, same specs, just a dell
[positive]	[14:40]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yeah, bit afraid they'll come out the same.. :-/ anything I should look at after concluding it's not connecting?
[negative]	[14:40]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ha ha, no. I would look it all up first. How would I learn how to setup static IPs, figure out DNSs, and all that on Ubuntu?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: You should download the text-based alternate cd from the ubuntu site.
[negative]	[14:40]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: me neither.. but no Process Name in the SysMon that resembles the one u're looking for?
[negative]	[14:40]	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, well if you wait here a few minutes I'll be happy to talk to you see if I can come up with any ideas to help y ideas to help you but I just need to restart this computer first so will be gone a few minutes ok?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: rebooted it only yesterday
[negative]	[14:40]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  PLEASE?
[negative]	[14:40]	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: nope...
[neutral]	[14:40]	<johnmike>	MttJocy: Sure! Thanks!
[negative]	[14:40]	<ciro>	bebraw, i just installed awn and awn manager but there are no applets in the program
[positive]	[14:40]	<mut80r>	johnmike: are you using network-manager? (the network icon in the top right corner)
[negative]	[14:41]	<Daverocks>	"Nomikos_: well it seems unstable rather than ""not connecting""... i'd start up a packet sniffer on it and check what's going on..."
[negative]	[14:41]	<MttJocy>	Okay, see you in a few minutes.
[negative]	[14:41]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  PLEASE?
[negative]	[14:41]	<bebraw>	ciro, i suppose you have to get the plugins elsewhere
[negative]	[14:41]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah
[negative]	[14:41]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: yeah if it's ppp, check those logs
[negative]	[14:41]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: good idea, I'll try that
[neutral]	[14:41]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: ppp?
[negative]	[14:41]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: The RAM requirement are just what they say on the Ubuntu web site, and could very welll be the reason of your problem. i've gotten the live cd to run on a box with 128MB!!
[negative]	[14:41]	<magnetron>	ciro: you have to drag something to the icon area, IIRC
[neutral]	[14:41]	<mut80r>	johnmike: right click nm-applet, click connection information. copy down IP address, default route, subnet mask, and DNS addresses.
[negative]	[14:41]	<x0x>	ok how to install eBox?
[neutral]	[14:41]	<bebraw>	has someone gotten blender work ok on hardy? it flickers between the app and bg here (using desktop fx)
[negative]	[14:41]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: i remember having the same prob but with Update Manager itself.. forgot what i did with it.. i'll try to trace back but i won't count on it.. sorry..
[negative]	[14:42]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: point-to-point... thought it might be the way it's going through the modem
[positive]	[14:42]	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I just got Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver). I installed those drivers and a blinking icon told me to reboot my pc. Now I can't use ubuntu anymore, I always get a black screen before log on screen. Can someone help me?
[neutral]	[14:42]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable modem, broadband
[negative]	[14:42]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: is the cable modem itself a network device or is it bridged?
[neutral]	[14:43]	<khafra>	The initramfs shell includes utilities like ls, egrep, etc--but not vi or anything
[neutral]	[14:43]	<josh04_>	:exit
[negative]	[14:43]	<khafra>	How do I edit files?
[negative]	[14:43]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: not sure what you mean - it's the modem that came with my broadband connection. used to have a router behind it to make a LAN, but atm ubuntu box is connected to it
[positive]	[14:43]	<LainIwakura>	Hello, I installed an xfonts .deb package. It shows up in xfontsel but I cannot set it in any application or X. What do I need to do so that I can actually use this font? Thanks for any help. I greatly appreciate it!

[neutral]	[14:43]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: only, and the modem cable goes well, into the wall

[neutral]	[14:44]	<khafra>	Like, when you've had an error on boot
[neutral]	[14:44]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: what i meant was, does the modem have its own ip? i'm guessing not
[negative]	[14:44]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Yes, they are afaik, thought I don't know how long it takes before they arrive.

[neutral]	[14:44]	<psych>	hi
[neutral]	[14:44]	<Lieutenant>	two - three weeks
[negative]	[14:44]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: ah, no, don't think so.
[neutral]	[14:44]	<khafra>	It has a very limited set of commands, and as far as I could tell the didn't include a text editor, and sed didn't work properly
[neutral]	[14:44]	<psych>	dpkg is freezing while starting samba daemons
[neutral]	[14:44]	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: if it's using the default filesystem (EXT3) yes

[negative]	[14:44]	<psych>	how can i abort it

[positive]	[14:45]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: 2-3 weeks, i'v got 6 and 7 on CD that way
[neutral]	[14:45]	<Paavi2_0>	psych: ctrl+c
[negative]	[14:45]	<psych>	i did that
[positive]	[14:45]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: thanks for your help.
[negative]	[14:45]	<tyler>	Leiutneant: Idont know if they ship out the alternate cd, either.
[neutral]	[14:45]	<psych>	but when apt-get install
[negative]	[14:45]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: so you've got no special cable clients running on the ubuntu box, you just use plain dhcp?
[neutral]	[14:45]	<mut80r>	johnmike: after disabling DHCP you will no longer get any addresses from your network so you'd need to enter them manually into every machine on your network
[neutral]	[14:45]	<psych>	it asks for restart that Paavi2_0
[neutral]	[14:45]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yes.
[positive]	[14:45]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: wud u recommend using a filesystem other than EXT3? wud that hav repercussions on my beautifully running hardy?
[negative]	[14:45]	<psych>	it says 1 not fully installed or removed.
[negative]	[14:46]	<jim_beam>	cut copy paste are single keys on keyboard -- real convenient.  maybe edit xorg.conf
[negative]	[14:46]	<psych>	i wanna abort samba installation
[neutral]	[14:46]	<psych>	for ever
[negative]	[14:46]	<mumu_>	"i installed eclipse on ubuntu. I am reading the eclipse tutorial ( @HLINK ) where it says i should select the ""Hello world c++ project"" project type. But there is no this project type. Why is that, am i missing something?"
[neutral]	[14:46]	<psych>	any thoughts?
[negative]	[14:46]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I'll go there now and try to connect another machine, see if that has the same issues. will also check with wireshark to see if anything is off
[negative]	[14:46]	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: I would not reccomend running *nix on anything other than EXT2/3. both are unrecognisable to windows but you can get a program to open EXT3 filesystems.
[negative]	[14:46]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: ok
[negative]	[14:46]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: thanks for your time
[neutral]	[14:46]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: no problem

[neutral]	[14:47]	<mut80r>	tj__: have you restarted after enabling the drivers?
[neutral]	[14:47]	<tj__>	yes
[negative]	[14:47]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ok! How do I make sure than my Ubuntu box is listening on the ports I need it to?
[negative]	[14:47]	<mut80r>	johnmike: that all depends on the program you're running that needs the ports forwarded.
[negative]	[14:47]	<tyler>	tj_: try manually editing xorg.conf
[neutral]	[14:47]	<tj__>	path?
[neutral]	[14:48]	<mut80r>	tj__: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[negative]	[14:48]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah. I'm just trying to set it up mainly for transmission, but someone had told me that I had to be careful when selecting a port for use because specific ports are reserved for specific things.
[negative]	[14:49]	<mut80r>	johnmike: select any port you want above 30000 as a safe rule. they can go up to 65535.
[neutral]	[14:49]	<A[D]minS>	xmms on hardy ?
[neutral]	[14:49]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ah...ok!

[negative]	[14:52]	<otarid>	Hi, I'm having trouble getting connected to wireless networks after upgrading to 8.04, my network card is Intel Pro/Wireless 3945 (also the wireless on/off LED doesn't work anymore, not that it matters..)
[negative]	[14:52]	<larry_>	ok finally found the gpg and installed it and got play on linux installed

[positive]	[14:57]	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I just got Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver).

[negative]	[15:00]	<nibsa1242b>	minus198: you need to have the wireless turned on for the system to know its there... you probably don't have to reboot just press the key combo to turn the card on
[negative]	[15:00]	<josh04_>	gausus: Try burning the CD at a low speed
[negative]	[15:00]	<z0g>	gausus, this was questioned before... edit the CD out of the /etc/apt/sources.list by placing a # in front

[negative]	[15:11]	<MirrorImage>	I don't know how to downgrade...
[neutral]	[15:11]	<MirrorImage>	Well, actually, I might. Last time it wouldn't let me for some weird reason.
[positive]	[15:11]	<linkmaster03>	graingert: I just want to set it so it will always open with a certain program when I double click it
[neutral]	[15:11]	<abhu>	Why Downgrade?
[neutral]	[15:11]	<MirrorImage>	the text is hard to read on the new beta for me.
[neutral]	[15:11]	<mut80r|brb>	MirrorImage: synaptic package manager. search for firefox. remove all completely. delete ~/.mozilla... reboot. sudo apt-get install firefox-2
[neutral]	[15:11]	<crashhandler>	where can i found default kde startup sound,somewhere on the net?
[negative]	[15:11]	<virus92ita>	z0g, seems interesting, but I first need to boot ubuntu from Hard Disk, not from live cd
[negative]	[15:11]	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: Its doing its Crash Detection Window, telling me that it crashed the last time it was running. And that window is useless.

[negative]	[15:12]	<Crusader_Tech>	Could someone help with an Ubuntu question? I just used Wubi to install Ubuntu on my laptop, and everything seems to work except my wirelss.  I found something that sounds like it might work on a web site, but it seems I need root access in a terminal window.
[neutral]	[15:12]	<bardyr>	When will the hardy+1 respo open?
[neutral]	[15:12]	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: Accessories -> Terminal. use sudo for admin commands
[neutral]	[15:12]	<nibsa1242b>	z0g: virus92ita yeah, restricted wirless drivers in a live CD situation are difficult to make work properly
[negative]	[15:12]	<bod_>	im still not geting sound because i seem to have 4 instances of my sound card 3 dont output sound and 1 gives an error -- audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Could not open audio device for playback. -- can someone help plz
[neutral]	[15:13]	<virus92ita>	z0g I'm gonna format my partition and reinstall ubuntu, so I can find right drivers
[negative]	[15:13]	<MttJocy>	pwm, Okay, have you restarted your computer after you changed your configuration? (btw I have not really tried to set up remote gdm, so I'm just trying to think of possible causes off the top of my head, since nobody else seams to have any answers anyway).
[negative]	[15:13]	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb, the command doesn't work once I try that.  It's like sudo puts me in some kind of different directory

[positive]	[15:14]	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: you have to put sudo before the command. not just sudo.   example:   sudo command
[negative]	[15:14]	<pwm>	MttJocy yeah i did the restart and just about everything else I could find on google so I must be missing something obvious
[negative]	[15:14]	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: I figured out that if I remove the .running file from the .evolution directory in my home folder it doesn't know that it crashed and starts up normally.
[negative]	[15:14]	<Beererde>	should i use glx or glx-new ???

[positive]	[15:21]	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: you can do that, but its a less modular approach, the default /etc/crontab file may also be overwritten by a future upgrade
[neutral]	[15:21]	<mut80r>	KalEl: windows and ubuntu are seperate.

[neutral]	[15:23]	<_paradox_>	i have gutsy
[negative]	[15:23]	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: you can use the /etc/cron.d directory but its a little more complicated then simply dropping the script in /etc/cron.weekly since you actually have to write a cron entry

[neutral]	[15:25]	<regis>	Crusader_Tech, be shure to enable all repos before
[negative]	[15:25]	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Might be interesting to check if this behaviour is repeatable, try doing the same thing you did just when it crashed the first time, see if it something random or a specific bug.

[negative]	[15:26]	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, Because if it is repeatable might be a good idea to submit a bug report to the evolution team.

[negative]	[15:37]	<Dante123>	okay, well I am still a skeptic because the original boot prob is sporadic anyway.  Sometimes it boots fine on first try.  But I will do as you say and see if the hangs are done.
[negative]	[15:37]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: I haven't ever heard of that, what is it?
[negative]	[15:37]	<nethakz>	anyone know why the network manager doesn't do wpa? I do have wpa-supplicant installed. this is for hardy...

[negative]	[15:38]	<_paradox_>	can anyone just give me a time estimate of about when update manager will notify me of hardy?
[neutral]	[15:38]	<MttJocy>	pwm, You are using IPv6 on your network then?
[negative]	[15:38]	<krasher>	﻿i'm having problems with ubuntu hardy heron, a LG Studioworks 55i and a Nvidia Geforce FX-5200... when i install the nvidia-glx-new driver and do a reboot, my computer starts in failsafe mode... i can't switch to 1024x768 at 60hz, my optimal resolution that i use in windows and at ubuntu 7.10, in which i had several problems until putting it to work properly
[negative]	[15:38]	<un2him>	Dante123: let me know if it works
[negative]	[15:38]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: How is compatability? I mean I don't play very many games, but the ones I do play are pretty complex
[positive]	[15:38]	<Dante123>	thanks...worked!  ﻿un2him  :-D
[neutral]	[15:38]	<Stomp442>	Paradox...hardy's out...should be in your update manager
[negative]	[15:38]	<PriceChild>	I remember places saying that ubuntu included an easy gui firewall by default, where is it?
[negative]	[15:38]	<bazhang>	albech some folks are experiencing difficulties when upgrading from gutsy to hardy with that card; I did as well--oddly enough a fresh install of hardy does not have that issue--the launchpad page may have some workaround by now if you wish to check
[positive]	[15:39]	<un2him>	Dante123: very cool, i'm glad!
[neutral]	[15:39]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: it has full binary compatibility with drivers and apps. directx and openGL work too on the games I use (unreal tournament, halo, etc)
[positive]	[15:39]	<Dante123>	thanks un2him.  Have a good day
[negative]	[15:39]	<MttJocy>	bagelong, Ah, sorry my apologies, I have only just upgraded to Hardy myself and hadn't noticed that particular utility.
[neutral]	[15:39]	<nethakz>	PriceChild, it not gui, it's command line only
[negative]	[15:39]	<pwm>	MttJocy I have no idea? both client and server are running ubuntu desktop 7.something
[negative]	[15:39]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: takes a few hundred megs of hdd space. boots up in ~ 30 seconds.
[positive]	[15:39]	<albech>	bazhang: guess ill backup my stuff and do a fresh install.. thanks

[neutral]	[15:40]	<pwm>	MttJocy ifconfig says somehting about ipv6
[positive]	[15:40]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: you can DL it as an ISO or a virtual machine (VMware, VirtualPC) I believe.
[negative]	[15:40]	<MttJocy>	pwm, But in netstat it is not bound to any IPv4 addresses?
[positive]	[15:40]	<bazhang>	albech best to try the livecd and verify what I said--it worked for me, but worksforme may not for you
[negative]	[15:40]	<weary>	ubuntu boots up but i get 'ALERT /dev/sda1<garbled> does not exist. Dropping to a shell'. where does the garbage after the devicename come from?
[negative]	[15:40]	<un2him>	Dante123: no prob...you too
[negative]	[15:40]	<pwm>	I can ping both host and server from each other - X -query localhost :1 does not work either
[negative]	[15:40]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: yeah but VM's don't support 3d rendering fast enough for games so there'd be no point in a VM
[positive]	[15:40]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: just to see what it's like :P
[neutral]	[15:40]	<pwm>	MttJocy correct netstat doesn't have any ipv4 port 177 application listed

[neutral]	[15:42]	<robert__>	does anyone know how to customize the ubuntu login screen?
[negative]	[15:42]	<bazhang>	gmenelau: ah yes; have you decided yet?
[neutral]	[15:42]	<giorgio>	Penso sia questo il prblema: @HLINK

[positive]	[15:43]	<bagelong>	bazhang:  Will I be able to download it now?
[negative]	[15:43]	<gmenelau>	bazhang more correct i dont see it no where in my program list
[positive]	[15:43]	<bazhang>	bagelong: sure but best to use the torrents; you can /msg ubotu torrents for the direct torrent link
[negative]	[15:44]	<_paradox_>	ok so will it be like a day or two or more before update manager notifies me?
[negative]	[15:44]	<ole>	Hey. I just installed 8.04 and it looks great. I would like to thank the everyone involved for a great distro.  I'm planing to install Ubuntu on more computers with the same setup, and I was wondering if there is an easy way to ouput the chooses I did in the install and create a preseeding file?
[negative]	[15:44]	<bazhang>	gmenelau: have you tried skype after typing alt f2?
[negative]	[15:44]	<minus198>	mut80r: so you have no idea what I should do next?

[negative]	[15:44]	<bagelong>	bazhang:  my main problem is an inability to get wireless card driver installed.  Is there any way it is the 64 bit install causing the problem?

[negative]	[15:45]	<zachary>	bluechaos1986: can't you just reduce the text size in the setting?
[neutral]	[15:45]	<bazhang>	bluechaos1986: you can adjust the fonts within firefox

[negative]	[15:45]	<bluechaos1986>	yeah, i did that. it's really wierd the links for youtube vids are like large and the rest are normal
[positive]	[15:46]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: awesome. And here I thought 7zip had strong compression.
[negative]	[15:46]	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: its ok, gzip is that good, and the system contain a LOT of compressable redundancy
[neutral]	[15:46]	<Dante123>	﻿crashanddie forgive the syntax
[neutral]	[15:46]	<bagelong>	bazhang:  I tried two different drivers.  The one recommended by ndiswrapper, and the one recommended by dell.  Keeps saying invalid driver.

[neutral]	[15:46]	<dmsuperman_>	hah
[negative]	[15:47]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	how do i enable the desktop cube in AompizConfig Settings Manager? i've already ticked Desktop Cube, Rotate Cube and 3D Windows..

[negative]	[15:47]	<dmsuperman_>	"ifireball: mut80r: Alright perhaps you know this. I wanted to use bzip2 compression to see if I could get it even smaller, however when I changed the command to use bzip2 the resulting file was 0 bytes. The only thing I changed was the tar options from ""cvpzf"" to ""cvpjf"" and the out file name from ""backup.tgz"" to ""backup.tar.bz2"""

[neutral]	[15:48]	<_paradox_>	alright well ty maybe ill get lucky and update manager will notify me by the end of the day about hardy
[neutral]	[15:48]	<ofh>	hi
[negative]	[15:48]	<ghostknife>	My system is overloading available resources. It seems to be trackerd. How do I turn this off? I never use it
[negative]	[15:48]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: I don't know anything about bz2. sorry
[neutral]	[15:48]	<ghostknife>	And how do I clean up the indexes.
[negative]	[15:48]	<bazhang>	gmenelau: is this kde3 or kde4
[neutral]	[15:48]	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_:  seems right
[negative]	[15:48]	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: what do you want to know about bz2?
[negative]	[15:48]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: no worries :S
[negative]	[15:48]	<tseug>	hello i cannot access my Home folder. neither through the icon nor through a shell.  however, i can access the folders WITHIN home folder... how can i fix this?
[positive]	[15:48]	<bagelong>	bazhang:  thanks.  I'll check it out.
[positive]	[15:48]	<josh04_>	bagelong: Same ;) Also, I found some help on how to fix it
[neutral]	[15:48]	<ofh>	someone that can help on firefox prob ??
[negative]	[15:48]	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: See my above question. basically my bz2 compression results in 0 byte files
[negative]	[15:49]	<josh04_>	bagelong: Have you changed anything since last night?

[negative]	[15:49]	<bagelong>	josh04:  just tried another driver through windows wireless driver utility to no avail
[neutral]	[15:49]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: @HLINK
[negative]	[15:49]	<ghostknife>	"dmsuperman_: try doing: tar -cpvf (leave the j). and use the extension "".tar"". thereafter try do do: bzip2 <file>"
[negative]	[15:49]	<robert__>	does anyone know how to use a regular picture for the login screen background?
[negative]	[15:49]	<gmenelau>	bazhang what is kde3 or kde 4 ?
[negative]	[15:49]	<josh04_>	bagelong: Apparently we need to add something to /etc/rc.local
[neutral]	[15:49]	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: That's what I thought, but it always outputs bz2 files. Even a simple command, compressing a single file like that makes it 0 bytes
[negative]	[15:49]	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: alright lemme try that real quick
[neutral]	[15:49]	<ghostknife>	robert__: kde/gnome?
[neutral]	[15:50]	<bazhang>	gmenelau: you are using kopete with gnome? or with kde?  (ubuntu or kubuntu)
[neutral]	[15:50]	<bagelong>	josh04:  Is that the full line?
[neutral]	[15:50]	<robert__>	gnome
[positive]	[15:50]	<RoRza>	anyone knows where I can install the Subverion or SVN ubuntu from
[negative]	[15:50]	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: may it be directory-location related? e.g you're running the command from the wrong place?
[neutral]	[15:50]	<josh04_>	"bagelong: Did the new driver say ""device present"" without needing ndiswrapper -a devid device?"
[negative]	[15:50]	<ghostknife>	anyone know of some fast search tool in ubuntu (that uses tracker-search-tool)?
[neutral]	[15:50]	<ghostknife>	ifireball: it worked with gzip

[neutral]	[15:50]	<ice-man>	hi is there a way to disable aptitude's systray icon when i use apt ??
[neutral]	[15:50]	<tseug>	mut80r, it says no such file or directory?!
[negative]	[15:50]	<gmenelau>	bazhang i use gnome  ubuntu
[negative]	[15:50]	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: I can't see anything majorly wrong there that would stop it working. try joining #compiz-fusion
[neutral]	[15:50]	<bagelong>	josh04:  just says invalid driver.  Now the other one - the one we installed last night, says it too.
[neutral]	[15:51]	<mut80r>	tseug: try adding sudo infront of it.
[negative]	[15:51]	<vicky123_>	hi everybody, i hav pentiun dual core processor. so which ubuntu i should download. (PC (Intel x86) desktop CD or 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD)?
[negative]	[15:51]	<eternal_p>	ice-man: it isn't aptitude per-say it is Update Manager, and I don't think yo ucan do it
[positive]	[15:51]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: a'right.. thanks...
[neutral]	[15:51]	<Wile>	How are the NTFS disks of the machines detected ? I have one partition missing in /media...
[positive]	[15:51]	<josh04_>	bagelong: How odd. Can you remove them both with ndiswrapper -r?
[negative]	[15:51]	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: That works. I am running this to backup 5GB worth of data though, so would it be a whole lot slower to archive and then compress as you suggested?
[negative]	[15:51]	<eternal_p>	vicky123_: you will be better served, if you are new to ubuntu to use the x86 rather than 64-bit
[negative]	[15:51]	<tseug>	mut80r, same thing 'No such file or directory'
[positive]	[15:51]	<bazhang>	vicky123_: depends on you; both will support dual core
[positive]	[15:51]	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r: regis was able to get me going. Thank you for taking the time to try to help me.
[negative]	[15:51]	<bagelong>	josh04:  I tried ndiswrapper -r and it will not work.  Had to remove them from the utility.
[negative]	[15:51]	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: well, it would have to do it in 2 steps instead of one
[negative]	[15:51]	<mut80r>	tseug: looks like a bad filesystem to me.
[neutral]	[15:51]	<mut80r>	Crusader_Tech: no problem
[negative]	[15:52]	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: can we do this in private, this channel is too busy? i'll help you fix it
[neutral]	[15:52]	<robert__>	is gnome hard to customize the login?
[positive]	[15:52]	<vicky123_>	thanx to both

[positive]	[15:54]	<mut80r>	Alan: because the 23rd images were used for the release.

[negative]	[15:59]	<_paradox_>	yesterday i had to reset my cable modem and router for a minute. is possible i missed the update manager's notification about hardy?
[negative]	[15:59]	<El1>	NinthWave: I think so, my problem is that when I install the drivers after X restart it turns to low-res mode, but I think it has the same cause, since we both have no gfx acceleration I assume
[neutral]	[15:59]	<eternal_p>	_paradox_: umm no
[neutral]	[16:00]	<mut80r>	anyoen know how I can disable join/part notices in Pidgin ?

[neutral]	[16:01]	<josh04_>	tseug: you need to use -r

[negative]	[16:03]	<eternal_p>	simonft2: ok, I may be out of my knowledge on this one,,, try logging in as root from a tui with the same password, failing that, you 'may' have to boot from the liveCD, and edit the hosts file from there, are you good with that?
[negative]	[16:04]	<DinCahill>	Neocortex: i think you need to mount it but im too nooby to know how

[neutral]	[16:10]	<crashanddie>	erUSUL, ok, thanks
[negative]	[16:10]	<ssam>	yowshi, depends how many changes you have made since you installed gutsy
[positive]	[16:11]	<esteth_>	yowshi: The upgrade process can not be made 100% stable. It has to deal with differences in everyones system. However if you were going to upgrade with a format anyway, it probably doesn't hurt to try the upgrade after your normal backup, and if it works it saves you a format

[negative]	[16:11]	<yowshi>	bazhang: cool then i can commence the upgrade process
[negative]	[16:11]	<ssam>	yowshi, if you have installed lots of third party stuff, or had to do lots of tweaks to make things work, then there is a higher chance of the upgrade breaking
[positive]	[16:11]	<simonft2>	﻿eternal_p: Thank you so much
[negative]	[16:11]	<amenado>	yowshi do like what i did, run a the iso from hard disk without installation, using your existing linux

[negative]	[16:12]	<amenado>	chazco i do not have that on mine.. so i see every message the boot loader spits out
[negative]	[16:12]	<yowshi>	amenado: that would tell me something i am prety sure of already that hardy is stable. the ubuntu folks do a decent job with thier stuff

[negative]	[16:12]	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41L5: you are probably asking for trouble, but grub can handle it, but I can't tell you how
[neutral]	[16:12]	<N1NCHN41L5>	i got all the partitions ready externed - virtual
[neutral]	[16:12]	<N1NCHN41L5>	SOME HAS TO KNWO

[neutral]	[16:13]	<elmer>	can anyone on Hardy confirm or deny that Nexuiz is working?

[negative]	[16:13]	<N1NCHN41L5>	weird thing is this dino comp runs ubuntu with compiz better than plain cubuntu
[neutral]	[16:13]	<graphikeye>	does creating a mount point on an existing ext2 partition erase the data on it?
[positive]	[16:13]	<tseug>	thanks erUSUL
[neutral]	[16:13]	<chazco>	May go back to Gusty on the laptop
[neutral]	[16:13]	<eternal_p>	elmer: there was a post about nexuiz in the development forum, I would google it for more info
[neutral]	[16:13]	<mut80r>	graphikeye: no
[positive]	[16:13]	<yowshi>	amenado: my question was would -upgrading- using the upgrade feature break. i have found that upgrading and installing dont work the same. a basic install is easy and usualy stable an upgrade can break in funny ways
[positive]	[16:13]	<elmer>	eternal_p, thanks, I will
[neutral]	[16:13]	<erUSUL>	tseug: no problem
[negative]	[16:13]	<eternal_p>	"graphikeye: only if you click ""format"""

[neutral]	[16:14]	<crashanddie>	graphikeye, of course not
[negative]	[16:14]	<pixelmonkey>	can someone point me to the FAQ entry about how I can get firefox2 back?  Firefox3 is nice and all, but most of the add-ons I'm used to don't work.
[negative]	[16:14]	<graphikeye>	so, if i want to install 8.04 over my existing 7.10 i should be ok?
[neutral]	[16:14]	<mut80r>	pixelmonkey: I have it, hold on
[neutral]	[16:14]	<bazhang>	pixelmonkey: install it
[neutral]	[16:14]	<N1NCHN41L5>	graphikeye: just resize the partition in gparted
[negative]	[16:14]	<crashanddie>	graphikeye, eh ?
[neutral]	[16:14]	<yowshi>	bazhang: i dont have the hard drive space to backup all my stuff
[neutral]	[16:14]	<erUSUL>	!upgrade | graphikeye
[neutral]	[16:14]	<ubotu>	graphikeye: For upgrading, see the instructions at @HLINK
[positive]	[16:14]	<eternal_p>	pixelmonkey: if you google nightly tester tools you can make more of 'em working, outside of that there is a step by step in tips and tricks
[positive]	[16:14]	<amenado>	yowshi-> let me put it this way, my confidence in a fresh install is higher than an upgraded install..hows that?

[negative]	[16:15]	<sploby>	And no one can help me?
[negative]	[16:15]	<amenado>	tseug-> just like any other partitions, they are like directories once mounted
[neutral]	[16:15]	<bazhang>	ask your question sploby
[neutral]	[16:15]	<eternal_p>	sploby: what is your question?
[negative]	[16:15]	<N1NCHN41L5>	no ideas on a second linux os - i know it can be done seen threads guys sayt they got 6 plus
[neutral]	[16:15]	<yowshi>	amenado: yeah but fresh means i lose everything i have installed including games and stuff and i dont want to go through and install everything some of it i dont know the name of i just use it now and then and i found it while browsing
[negative]	[16:16]	<sploby>	 How do you make Dual-Monitor work on Hardy without have a blank screen every time you start the system?
[neutral]	[16:16]	<xionox>	hi
[negative]	[16:16]	<tseug>	amenado, i don't know where to find the directory
[positive]	[16:16]	<amenado>	yowshi now this is your call then, you take the plunge and start fresh or you fiddle and tweak til it satisfies your needs
[positive]	[16:16]	<xionox>	I need some help about backuppc :)
[negative]	[16:16]	<tseug>	"amenado, i'm looking in ""  ls /  ""  but i only see a 'cdrom'"
[neutral]	[16:16]	<amenado>	tseug-> first it has to be mounted,
[positive]	[16:16]	<mut80r>	N1NCHN41L5: it can be done. run the PCLinuxOS installer and it should detect you have GRUB already and add itself to the boot menu.
[neutral]	[16:16]	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41LS: @HLINK  (first result)
[positive]	[16:16]	<ssam>	N1NCHN41L5, most linux installers do a pretty good job of finding other linux distros and making a GRUB list to boot all of them
[negative]	[16:16]	<yowshi>	amenado: i'll fiddle i have a 50/50 track record with uphgrades. fiesty gave me touble but gutsy didnt
[negative]	[16:16]	<tseug>	amenado, how do i mount?
[negative]	[16:17]	<amenado>	tseug any storage devices has to be mounted first

[negative]	[16:17]	<amenado>	yowshi-> you have already made up your mind anyway, asking us seems wasteful
[neutral]	[16:17]	<erUSUL>	Fritzel: the kill default signal
[negative]	[16:18]	<ssam>	N1NCHN41L5, ok
[neutral]	[16:18]	<Fritzel>	ahh alright that makes it easy then

[negative]	[16:18]	<Beererde>	hi. my gtk-window-decoration is not working. how can i fix it?=
[negative]	[16:18]	<yowshi>	amenado: well i know i will upgrade i was just wondering what the general excperience with this upgrade has been. have there been a large number of instances where it brokew
[negative]	[16:18]	<mut80r>	crashanddie: it worked for me. I'm on firefox-2. how is it bad ?
[negative]	[16:18]	<alpharesearch>	do i need to edit xorg.conf now?

[neutral]	[16:18]	<Konam>	?
[negative]	[16:19]	<crashanddie>	mut80r, they imply that 2 versions of firefox should not be installed at one given time
[positive]	[16:19]	<mut80r>	crashanddie: well, it's true, with conflicting configurations and all ..
[neutral]	[16:19]	<amenado>	yowshi-> it just came out two days ago, and you expect in-depth experience and troubles listed already? come on...

[negative]	[16:20]	<crashanddie>	mut80r, it's not true at all, I have FF2 and FF3 at the same time, with no problems whatsoever
[negative]	[16:20]	<yowshi>	amenado: sorry i had my info wrong my bad
[negative]	[16:20]	<alpharesearch>	is there not a tool that can help to change form vesa to nvidia
[positive]	[16:20]	<bazhang>	mut80r: indeed you can have both
[negative]	[16:20]	<dassouki>	i upgraded to hardy yesterday, my sound isn't working I've tried the ! sound tutorial with no vain. lspci and ldconfig can see my card, nothing odd about dmesg. i've tried alsamixer and gstream-properties but nothing so far. can anyone help me please
[neutral]	[16:20]	<crashanddie>	!firefox2
[negative]	[16:20]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about firefox2 - try searching on @HLINK
[positive]	[16:20]	<mut80r>	crashanddie: well, whatever works for you. :)   I wouldn't try both but will get rid of ff2 when ff3 final comes out.
[negative]	[16:20]	<landspite>	i'm having trouble with GDM under vmware, where is the screen resolution configured for gdm?
[negative]	[16:21]	<amenado>	landspite-> that would be same place as if you were running in native as opposed to vmware?
[positive]	[16:21]	<landspite>	where is that ;)
[neutral]	[16:21]	<alpharesearch>	what is the command line name of the tool that was used in 7.10 to change the graphics card?
[neutral]	[16:22]	<amenado>	landspite-> hunt around xorg.conf or System-->preferences

[negative]	[16:24]	<PhotoJim>	there must be a page somewhere on the net that lists all the software repositories and mirrors... but I cannot find it, neither on ubuntu help's search nor on google.  suggestion?  my current repositories are completely overwhelmed with update traffic.
[negative]	[16:24]	<amenado>	schnootop-> because the video driver does not support it so it advise you of such?
[neutral]	[16:24]	<mut80r>	red_: what steps did you follow to downgrade ?
[negative]	[16:25]	<alpharesearch>	amenado: I don't have that anymore?
[negative]	[16:25]	<Beererde>	hi. my gtk-window-decoration is not working. how can i fix it?=
[negative]	[16:25]	<RHeLL>	I have a problem with my media shortcut... the mute button just mute the fronts speakers and not the PCM

[negative]	[16:25]	<schnootop>	amenado, do you know how i can get around this ? it did work in 7,10. Although since the upgrade i get that error. and when i play my movies in full screen it flickers. any idea what i can do ?
[neutral]	[16:25]	<Millertime_018>	can anyone help me?
[neutral]	[16:25]	<mut80r>	beererde: do you have CCSM ?
[neutral]	[16:26]	<eternal_p>	schnootop: try disabling compiz first, does it work then?

[neutral]	[16:27]	<schnootop>	eternal_p, i just changed back over to metacity and i still cant access the resolution screen
[neutral]	[16:27]	<mut80r>	red_: crashanddie suggests that you can have both. that choice is up to you.
[negative]	[16:27]	<eternal_p>	"schnootop: what do you mean you ""can't access"" and what video card?"
[neutral]	[16:27]	<tuxice>	﻿what is the package called with the ubuntu title font and capitals
[negative]	[16:27]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: does your macbook support booting over firewire?  that'd be the obvious first thing to check.

[negative]	[16:28]	<eternal_p>	schnootop: ah..good ol ati, I didn't see the error before, sorry
[neutral]	[16:28]	<simmerz>	I'm now using hardy
[negative]	[16:28]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: k.  that's the extent of my intelligent advice, alas.  but it might pay to read the grub man page.  perhaps you can manually install the boot sector on the external drive, if it's missing.  I assume the drive isn't coming up at all and you're not even getting grub.
[negative]	[16:29]	<red_>	mut80r i dont get you sorry. im now opening the link you just gave me
[negative]	[16:29]	<schnootop>	eternal_p, do you know if there are better drivers that i can use besides the defaults ?

[neutral]	[16:30]	<hilts50>	PhotoJim:  I'll take a look in there.  I shows as an option to boot to... When selected and the machine tries to boot it says in the command line that it can't find the boot device...
[negative]	[16:30]	<simmerz>	anyone? can't use back/forward mouse buttons in firefox, but the z and x axis buttons are set in Xorg.conf
[positive]	[16:30]	<eternal_p>	schnootop: yup, it is a risk, no question, but will load down a later driver
[positive]	[16:30]	<alpharesearch>	amenado: thanks a lot
[positive]	[16:30]	<red_>	mut80r thanks. be back in a while
[negative]	[16:30]	<eternal_p>	schnootop: the best thing is to throw the error into google with the word ubuntu @ the end
[positive]	[16:30]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: ok, that's a bit different.  if you look at the grub screen, there will be an option to edit the boot command line.  something is awry in it.
[neutral]	[16:30]	<Beererde>	still no decorations
[negative]	[16:30]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: don't reinstall the boot sector.  you clearly have one.
[negative]	[16:30]	<mut80r>	red_: take your time.
[negative]	[16:31]	<alpharesearch>	amenado: I just wonder if there is a new way of doing things now?
[positive]	[16:31]	<schnootop>	eternal_p, ive already tried that and still havent found a real solution :P
[negative]	[16:31]	<amenado>	alpharesearch-> i have the 7.10 ..launched it, looked in the ps status list, and picked off the command that launches it
[positive]	[16:31]	<eternal_p>	schnootop: get a nvidia card instead ;) lol
[negative]	[16:31]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: I had a similar problem on a PC desktop once.  the grub config was trying to load the kernel from the wrong drive.  I manually corrected it, and all was good.
[positive]	[16:31]	<hilts50>	PhotoJim:  Any tips for what to look for in there?  :)
[negative]	[16:31]	<gapagos>	is there any good video editing program for ubuntu

[positive]	[16:31]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: I'm not a mac guy, sorry . :) but do some googling and see what hardware description external firewire drives usually have.
[positive]	[16:32]	<eternal_p>	gapagos: there is one listed in ubuntuguide.org I believe
[positive]	[16:32]	<amenado>	alpharesearch-> it may be hidden in some other icon?  we all are discovery mode for 8.04
[neutral]	[16:32]	<ssam>	cory_, system->administration->software sources

[negative]	[16:44]	<Dante123>	amenado I already have hardy installed on another pc....so I have a feel for it and I like it so far.  Would running the livecd basically pick up the non-integrated card and install properly or do you think I will have to go through all the hassles again?
[neutral]	[16:44]	<JenFraggle>	please can someone help with a mouse problem on hardy.  thanks
[negative]	[16:44]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, the one you're looking for (if a program locked up or doesn't respond to -15) is SIGKILL (or -9)
[negative]	[16:44]	<El1>	Is there anybody who knows on which packages the hardware drivers manager depends? Or where I can look this up?
[neutral]	[16:44]	<bazhang>	gapagos: nay

[negative]	[16:44]	<Creeture>	gapagos: Nope.
[neutral]	[16:44]	<nith>	np

[positive]	[16:44]	<PhotoJim>	Millertime_018: this machine originally had dapper drake on it and it's upgraded nicely from there (so far).

[neutral]	[16:45]	<as2000>	is there a legacy driver for ati cards?
[negative]	[16:45]	<gapagos>	Creeture, thats something linux zealots should work on lol
[neutral]	[16:45]	<bazhang>	!away > Scrounch
[negative]	[16:45]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, so the syntax would be kill -9 PID, you can get the process ID through ps (man ps), alternatively, you could use killall to bypass the PS step, and directly give the name of processes to kill

[negative]	[16:45]	<yahya__>	mut80r, I would have done that, but this is a problem of my n00b friend, he wont know how to mount his HDD linux partition. Nothing to just add to boot option, like edit them on boot?
[negative]	[16:45]	<|neon|>	? ASUS Laptop with screen light sensor, everytime i boot i have to change the file ls_switch from 1 to 0 in order to gain brightness control, otherwise the screen is too dark to be usable, how can i make this permanent instead of having o edit the file evrytime i boot

[negative]	[16:46]	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: i dont know that i can help then. i know that ubuntu separates volume a lot; like the pc speakers can be on high while the output audio may be quite

[positive]	[16:47]	<mut80r>	Wiredtape: if you're removing grub or ubuntu, after removing it you will need to reinstate the other OS'es bootloader. if it's vista you can do this from recovery options on the vista dvd. otherwise go into recovery mode from an XP cd

[positive]	[16:56]	<crashanddie>	Itaku, you should be able to right click and open a console

[negative]	[16:57]	<mut80r>	Itaku: I don't know.

I have just installed ubuntu 8.04 and it seems to have problems with the Display of the laptop: When it puts the display in low consuption mode, after that it does not recovers and the display is all black. Some suggested package to install in order to handle power in a better way??????????
[neutral]	[16:58]	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: it isn't like 16->32 bit... but some people may tell you different

[neutral]	[16:58]	<N1NCHN41L5>	but this.........
[negative]	[16:58]	<Ntemis>	anything to do to fix that i dont want to use the bash
[neutral]	[16:58]	<eternal_p>	all depends on how much free time yo uwant to have
[negative]	[16:58]	<bazhang>	cory_: open up synaptic package manager and under settings look in repositories and choose from there; then reload and search for the package you want

[negative]	[16:59]	<PieSquared>	according to df its on some 'overflow' partiion of something
[negative]	[17:00]	<dmsuperman>	Is there a way to make it so messages with my name in them are opened in another tab/window in XChat? I basically just want it to _really_ alert me, plus if I come back I want to be able to see who called my name
[negative]	[17:00]	<errpast>	GoodJob, Isn't it in the repos
[negative]	[17:00]	<Nith>	J-Unit: as opposed to a Cisco router that costs much much more
[neutral]	[17:00]	<crashanddie>	scrounch, that's enough, really
[neutral]	[17:00]	<OllieA>	I need to add a screen resolution so I can view Ubuntu in 1024x768, how do I add it?
[negative]	[17:00]	<GoodJob>	errpast, not that i know of
[negative]	[17:00]	<bazhang>	GoodJob: that is no longer maintained, better to try xmms2 or audacious
[negative]	[17:00]	<J-Unit>	Nith, but my real question is: do i need to do anything software wise or is it all just like plug a cable here and there?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<Itaku>	OllieA: system>preferences> screen resolution
[negative]	[17:00]	<Nith>	dmsuperman: sorry but that's more of an XChat script thing. try googling but it isnt something the standard ubuntu power-user would know
[negative]	[17:00]	<crashanddie>	dmsuperman, not by default
[negative]	[17:00]	<tiax>	dmsuperman: well you could always type /lastlog dmsuperman or write a script to do it
[positive]	[17:00]	<Zaphod_42>	"GoodJob, install audiacious. Then make a symlink ""xmms"" to the audiacous-binary ;)"
[negative]	[17:00]	<J-Unit>	Nith, sry for being stupid
[neutral]	[17:00]	<PieSquared>	Should /tmp be on the 'overflow' file system?
[negative]	[17:00]	<errpast>	GoodJob, sounds like maybe a tar.gz type of effort. Or compile. Make sure you have build essentials
[negative]	[17:00]	<lordofthepigs>	hello, will my crontabs run even if I am not logged in?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<PieSquared>	That's where it says it is
[neutral]	[17:00]	<OllieA>	Itaku: It only has 860x600
[negative]	[17:00]	<trekkme>	in my xorg.conf i have put only a resolution of 1280x1024 but gnome/ubuntu always falls back to 800x600 what could be the prob?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: It's pretty much just stuff that uses lots of double-presision floating points and memory addressing over 4GB that will be affected, right?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<mut80r>	J-Unit: plug a cable between modem and router's internet port. plug cable between router and pc. restart modem. restart router.
[negative]	[17:00]	<OllieA>	Itaku: Or whatever
[neutral]	[17:00]	<Itaku>	OllieA: you can scroll

[neutral]	[17:02]	<su-hoens`rZ>	i just did a sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[17:02]	<dmsuperman>	tiax, I mainly want it so when I leave with xchat open and somebody calls my name I can see what they sent me, and /lastlog only searches within the text that's currently in the buffer
[negative]	[17:02]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: You're right about that, I suppose - though there's plenty of tech I kick myself for not adopting earlier after the fact.
[positive]	[17:02]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, high speed eh :)
[neutral]	[17:02]	<mut80r>	MrObvious: LOL.

[positive]	[17:02]	<crashanddie>	mut80r, nice :)
[neutral]	[17:02]	<dassouki>	is there a way i can remove all my sound car information and reinstall sound from scratch ?
[negative]	[17:02]	<eternal_p>	doomskillet: so when yo uinstall your new OS, put /home on its own partitoin, so if you want to go 64-bit you don't need to backup

[positive]	[17:03]	<rinaldi_>	anyone here have counterstrike source in steam with wine? Every time I join a game, it freezes when I get to team select. Any Ideas?
[neutral]	[17:03]	<su-hoens`rZ>	Kr0ntab hostname yields hoens-linux
[negative]	[17:03]	<GoodJob>	but the old xmms does not support PulseAudio, doesn't it?
[neutral]	[17:03]	<mut80r>	crashanddie: £30/month
[negative]	[17:03]	<lordofthepigs>	Sindacious, also try: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 --help to see what you can with the apache server
[positive]	[17:03]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: I do frequent backups, anyway. The way I figure it, when an OS upgrade is free, I don't need to prematurely optimize it :D
[negative]	[17:03]	<su-hoens`rZ>	Kr0ntab: no, but i noticed taht that was gone from the file now
[neutral]	[17:03]	<eternal_p>	rinaldi_ best to ask in #wine

[negative]	[17:03]	<crashanddie>	mut80r, ok, fair enough
[neutral]	[17:03]	<bazhang>	N1NCHN41L5: that is not a walkthrough type deal; there are some links given to you best to read them carefully before preceding then asked informed questions
[positive]	[17:03]	<errpast>	GoodJob, I think you need to enable Universe repo
[negative]	[17:03]	<figuringout>	"hi, there is this ext3 partition i need to mount. I get this error "" bad superblock"" I was working before"
[neutral]	[17:04]	<GoodJob>	universe, hmmm
[negative]	[17:04]	<dmsuperman>	Nith, yeah, me too in XChat, but when I'm gone for a while and come back I can't see any such messages. I'll look for something like that though, i just wasn't sure what the feature is called that colors your name
[neutral]	[17:04]	<crashanddie>	dmsuperman, highlight
[negative]	[17:04]	<Nith>	figuringout: try an fsck on it (make sure its not mounted)
[neutral]	[17:04]	<eternal_p>	figuringout: do a fsck on the volume
[negative]	[17:04]	<errpast>	GoodJob, looks like xmms is in Universe. You can do that via Synaptic gui. Or straight to /etc/apt/sources.list
[negative]	[17:04]	<OllieA>	How do I add a screen resolution to the drop down box in System => Preferences => Screen Resolution...
[negative]	[17:04]	<Kr0ntab>	su-hoens`rZ: okay.. unless you have root with a password....  reboot into recovery console mode...  and fix the /etc/hosts file manually...

[positive]	[17:04]	<figuringout>	eternaal_p: what will that do?
[positive]	[17:04]	<chazco>	Hi... I have the Hardy slow start bug... adding clocksource=hpet to the kernel command line fixes it. Is it safe to make this permanent? erUSUL if you are still here the bug i was describing earlier is @HLINK
[negative]	[17:04]	<N1NCHN41L5>	ive read many - u basically let the cd do the work - dont install grub go into /boot/menu.lst add other os and ur good
[negative]	[17:05]	<fstxx>	what is required to play dvd's in hardy? The official doc is still 7.10, it sya you should install libdvdplay0, but that is not in the hardy repository. running the install-css script seems to work, but then gxine core dumps. Totem still gives meerror reading from resource error. What is the official story?
[neutral]	[17:05]	<GoodJob>	errpast, i have the Universe repo enabled in Software Sources

[negative]	[17:05]	<N1NCHN41L5>	but that failed miserably even when i had code to paste in nenu.lst written for me
[neutral]	[17:05]	<GoodJob>	it isn't fetched
[negative]	[17:05]	<su-hoens`rZ>	Kr0ntab and why did upgrading cause my etc/hosts file to get overwritten
[negative]	[17:05]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: So, when everything starts to run smoothly on the 64-bit distro, I can just go ahead and upgrade. I doubt I'll notice any performance improvement on the 64-bit distro, anyway - at least, not enough to counter-balance the headaches I'm bound to encounter with the proprietary crap that we're still forced to deal with.
[negative]	[17:05]	<OllieA>	How do I add a screen resolution to the drop down box in System => Preferences => Screen Resolution...
[negative]	[17:05]	<GoodJob>	don't know why :/

[negative]	[17:05]	<Kr0ntab>	su-hoens`rZ: 127.0.0.1 should have localhosts next to it.... and 127.0.1.1 should have your hostname next to it.  and maybe even your fully qualified domain name.

[neutral]	[17:05]	<pwm>	anyone know how I do an ipv6 version of X -query <hostname> where hostname is not an ipv4 address?

[negative]	[17:49]	<dinho-br>	hello. I've just installed Ubuntu 7.04, but my connection isn't working. I tried to manually configure ip, mask, gateway and dns, but it didn't work. What do I have to do? Thanks in advance
[negative]	[17:49]	<dinho-br>	sorry... Ubuntu 8.04
[neutral]	[17:49]	<bazhang>	!resetpanels | gapagos
[neutral]	[17:49]	<ubotu>	gapagos: To reset the panel to defaults, type this in a !terminal: « gconftool --recursive-unset /apps/panel && killall gnome-panel »
[negative]	[17:49]	<z0g>	dinho-br, what kind of connection?
[positive]	[17:49]	<tockitj>	does upgrade 7.10 -> 8.04 work well ?
[neutral]	[17:49]	<z0g>	are you able to ping your gateway?
[negative]	[17:49]	<MachinTrucChose>	how can I make nautilus ask me to confirm whether I want to delete a file when DEL is pressed? It's kind of annoying if you press something accidentally and the file is gone
[neutral]	[17:50]	<amenado>	Rawk02-> i dislike the usage of that roaming, once in a while you looses control of your configs as you have experienced

[negative]	[17:50]	<gapagos>	bazhang i dont want to reset panels settings, the thing is they wont apply my custom settings
[negative]	[17:50]	<amenado>	MachinTrucChose-> you just have to be careful thats all and not click willy nilly
[negative]	[17:50]	<astro76>	gapagos: not sure killall gnome-panel should do it, as should logging out.. never tried that setting
[neutral]	[17:50]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: or wireless?
[neutral]	[17:50]	<dinho-br>	my connection is wired
[negative]	[17:50]	<mhtsos>	how do i change the keys that switch language plz?
[negative]	[17:50]	<Rawk02>	amenado: must be set up as default because I did not change it...odd for a wired connection
[negative]	[17:50]	<strange_loop>	Strange. Ubuntu 7 runs inside Qemu. Ubuntu 8 doesnt. Does this mean Ubuntu 8 supports less hardware then Ubuntu 7? Or does simulated hardware not count?

[negative]	[18:27]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: I meant flash and 64 bit have a bit of a hassle getting going
[negative]	[18:27]	<amenado>	NightBird-> cant do much then if your liveCD also detects same,  how about older 7.10 livecd ?
[negative]	[18:27]	<Marce_>	zog, but i wanted to have propertary drivers working :(

[neutral]	[18:28]	<g0th>	hi
[positive]	[18:28]	<gor1>	﻿ mindlord: another point is install fluxbox, that bypasses a lot of the gnome desktop crud,  simply sudo apt-get install fluxbox, at the GDM greeter, go to change session at bottom right, select fluuxbox, you right-click for the menu, most stuff in applications at top of list, just avoid using nautilus as a noob with fluxbox ;)   If no fluxbox probs then ur prooblem maybe gnomey-related
[neutral]	[18:28]	<amenado>	keycool1-> labels on the device perhaps?

[neutral]	[18:29]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: no sweat.
[neutral]	[18:29]	<amenado>	NightBird-> it should not wipe out your /home  if you have it in separate partitions..try to boot from older 7.10 livecd?

[neutral]	[18:55]	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: then it is working; now try sudo apt-get upgrade or sudo apt-get install packagename
[negative]	[18:55]	<gnomefreak>	krasher: that seems to be a fairly common issue atleast on my 3 boxes i upgraded, i had to make a new X11.xorg file using nvidia-config i think it was
[neutral]	[18:55]	<rotw>	mark_: cp foo.fon ~/.fonts/foo.fon
[negative]	[18:55]	<MedO42>	bebraw: Also, there is a free (non-sun) jre installed by default I think. Maybe you want to try uninstalling that.
[negative]	[18:55]	<Musicalduck>	hey, could someone help? I've installed ubuntustudio, but can only boot up into command line and no GUI loads

[negative]	[18:56]	<amenado>	noozz-> can you please only repeat every 10 minutes or so, if someone knows , they will assist instead of repeating every two minutes
[neutral]	[18:56]	<mark_>	rotw I put it there and ran rebooted, but it still does not show
[positive]	[18:56]	<_alf_>	just_bob: i think php-pear is fine for php5: apt-cache search php5 | grep pear
[negative]	[18:56]	<shigutso>	where is the Shared Folders icon in Ubuntu 8.04? I can't share a folder because I don't have permissions to do that...
[negative]	[18:56]	<gnomefreak>	Musicalduck: make sure the desktop package is intalled, but you might have better luck in #ubuntustudio or #ubuntu-studio (cant remember what one it is)
[negative]	[18:56]	<bastones>	Hello. I am trying to install Ubuntu from the CD I received a few days ago, and it begins to load with the orange bar and it gets to just about the middle and freezes. I tried addong noapic from F6 but that didn't fix it either. Anyone got any solutions, as I really want to get away from Microsoft Windows.
[neutral]	[18:56]	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: not sure; you need to provide more info
[neutral]	[18:56]	<Seven_Six_Two>	Musicalduck, did you install the rt kernel?
[neutral]	[18:56]	<rotw>	mark_: /usr/share/fonts ?
[negative]	[18:56]	<NightBird>	amenado: I'm downloading now... 3 hours remaining
[neutral]	[18:56]	<bazhang>	bastones: try the alternate cd
[positive]	[18:56]	<DB42>	no #ubuntu+1 ? :) what about 8.10 :)
[negative]	[18:56]	<keycool1>	amenado: would my card be the aironet 350 mini-pci wireless lan client adapter or the aironet 350 wireless lan client adapter?
[neutral]	[18:56]	<polcany>	oki
[negative]	[18:57]	<uwo>	tnx all, was hoping for someting like automatix to still exits - not because of codecs, but skype, realplayer, google earth... all in one place
[neutral]	[18:57]	<mark_>	rotw Yes, there too, I ran fc-cache and rebooted after that as well. worked with a ttf but not fon
[negative]	[18:57]	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: Idk really whats wrong, i was on gutsy and  i updated to hardy and now it just doesnt work.
[positive]	[18:57]	<MedO42>	﻿Is the arch/x86-part of the kernel source tree used for both 32- and 64-bit?
[negative]	[18:57]	<bastones>	bazhang: sorry, didn't understand you there. What alternate CD?
[neutral]	[18:57]	<yao_ziyuan>	continue my last question:
[negative]	[18:57]	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: well with that amount of info not sure what to say
[neutral]	[18:57]	<amenado>	keycool1-> hard for me to tell, its not infront of me...read what your laptop vendor says about your model
[negative]	[18:57]	<Gokee2>	noozz, Whats your xorg log say?

[positive]	[18:57]	<_alf_>	just_bob: apt-cache showpkg php-pear  <-- shows it depends on php5
[neutral]	[18:57]	<bazhang>	!alternate | bastones
[positive]	[18:57]	<ubotu>	bastones: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at @HLINK
[negative]	[18:57]	<rotw>	mark_: hum. try and google it, ya never know, someone might've had the same problem. if not, look for a converter
[negative]	[18:57]	<_alf_>	just_bob i dunno about the others. if they are pear scripts use the pear you just installed to get them
[neutral]	[18:57]	<noozz>	Gokee2: dont know what that is
[neutral]	[18:58]	<yao_ziyuan>	which spawns two processes that restore each other when i kill either one in ksysguard,
[positive]	[18:58]	<yao_ziyuan>	and which adds startup items in ~/.kde/Autostart
[positive]	[18:58]	<mark_>	rotw, thank you. google taught me about the folders. I will look for a converter
[negative]	[18:58]	<bazhang>	yao_ziyuan: get clamav or avast linux version if that really worries you
[neutral]	[18:58]	<yao_ziyuan>	does that mean my current normal user account is ruined?
[negative]	[18:58]	<Gokee2>	noob13, Hmm SO you see bootup right?  Its just when x start (right before the login screen) it blanks?
[neutral]	[18:58]	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: i think it said something about boot/grub
[negative]	[18:58]	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: some kind of folder like that i dont remember. that may have been the problem.
[negative]	[18:58]	<swiftfoxer>	excuse me, but does anyone know how I can enable flash in swiftfox? or did I mess up the install and I have to reinstall it somehow?

[neutral]	[18:59]	<just_bob>	_alf_ the others are php5-mcal php5-domxml php5-xslt
[negative]	[18:59]	<hansin>	Does anyone thing there would be a problem if I did a minimal CLI install from the 8.04 beta CD, and apt-get updated from there?  Or should I really download the offcial 8.04 release CD and go from there?  I'd rather avoid wasting the bandwith and CD if I could, but if there is a problem installing from the 8.04 beta and upgrading I would.  Agian, I am only looking for a minimal CLI install, so it is much more basic that the full install
[negative]	[18:59]	<yao_ziyuan>	i think i should create a backup normal user account
[negative]	[18:59]	<xSnOoPyx>	damnit, anyone else have problems with sound after installing?

[neutral]	[18:59]	<Gokee2>	noozz*
[positive]	[18:59]	<keycool1>	amenado: ok great thanks for the patience, I know I don't know my way around that well. It looks like its the mini PCI card. I have the link for the driver, but it only offers my windows 2000 and win xp options
[neutral]	[19:00]	<yao_ziyuan>	imagine this:

Add xorg sever, SLiM, various lightweight window managers.  More I am wondering if I really need to offcial release CD, or can I reuse my 8.04 beta CD instead and upgrade via apt-get or apptitude instead?

[negative]	[19:26]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I just switched to the nv driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and I'm getting better performance.  I think there is some regression in the nvidia driver + X.org + possibly GNOME stuff like cairo.
[neutral]	[19:26]	<daemon3>	8 hours to complete the upgrade!!!!????!!!??
[neutral]	[19:26]	<Piteco>	yes i now

[negative]	[19:26]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I don't get 3D with the nv driver, but I can live without that for now.
[negative]	[19:26]	<LuitvD>	hou5ton: as of yet I don't think there's an advantage of the 64-bit version...

[negative]	[19:26]	<gnomefreak>	bigtimer121: without seeing it i cant tell you exactly what is going to happen
[negative]	[19:26]	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, maybe because they have restructured the IO layer in gnome with the introduction of gio and this feature was too late to implement but i agree with you its a handy feature for some people
[neutral]	[19:26]	<cgentry72>	bazhang, 2.6.24-16-generic
[negative]	[19:26]	<Pelo>	djlenoir, ok  reboot the comp, when you get to the boot menu ,  select the correct menu option and type E to edit ,  find the root line and change it to root (hd0,0) ,    then type enter to accept and type b to boot ,  you'll hve to chagne it manaly in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file once you have booted,  changes from the menu are not permanent

[negative]	[19:27]	<bigtimer121>	can i remove it and then try and use the add/remove application
[negative]	[19:27]	<LuitvD>	hou5ton: there's more hassle with java and flash and stuff, so if you don't want issues, the regular i386 would be the safe choice
[negative]	[19:27]	<Exteris>	pixelmonkey, is it much faster? how did you measure performance? because i might switch back too then
[negative]	[19:27]	<lethalamby>	I had to recreate my swap partition

[neutral]	[19:28]	<Piteco>	I'm new with ubuntu
[negative]	[19:28]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris but basically, with the nvidia driver, Evolution uses about 50% CPU during normal usage (e.g., selecting/reading e-mails) and with nv, it's back down to 0-5% where it should be.
[positive]	[19:28]	<Exteris>	nl2br, i have the same card, the restricted drivers work fine
[neutral]	[19:28]	<danbhfive>	nl2br: use the restricted drivers manager

[neutral]	[19:33]	<Roshane>	Pelo the tabs are software and update right?
[negative]	[19:33]	<danbhfive>	RequinB4: yes, there is a meta kernel package that depends on the latest kernel.  For me, I use linux-generic     I think most use that one

[negative]	[19:35]	<danbhfive>	RequinB4: I really don't know.  Actually, not that I think more, the kernels don't overwrite each other.  Only for a point release does the kernel overwrite.  But, if you install a kernel separately from whats installed by ubuntu, it probably won't get overwritten

[neutral]	[19:42]	<gnomefreak>	Daremonai: did you run apt-get update after commenting them out?
[negative]	[19:42]	<biabia>	I figured out my problem with my install, all my hard drive device names were changed so they were wrong in my fstab, i just had to manually mount them and edit the fstab

[negative]	[19:42]	<pixelmonkey>	supersako at first I tried 116, and that didn't work because it mis-detected the version of VMWare I was running

OpenOffice Writer substitutes a font for Tahoma, because I don't have Tahoma installed.  I really like whatever it's substituting, but I don't know what it's substituting.  OpenOffice has no font substitutions configured, so it's using something external, but I don't know what, or how to track down which font this might be.

I never used it, so i replaced it with the most recent version of Freespire. I did not like freespire, and am just goiong to let it sit there on my disk for a while. But after I installed it (or more correctly, after I moved too many files over from old partition and filled this one.) i ran out of disk space. I deleted my trash (had about
[negative]	[21:17]	<chris_probl>	 10 gigs in it!) but whenever I am logged in my computer says that I have no disk space. If I go into terminal and log in as another user (not graphically) it says I have 10 gigs left. Gparted also says that. Another problem (though it may be unrelated) is that when I press the log out button all the panels crash. With this bug I cannot even press the back button on my browser, for it wont store my previous web pages as files. I canno

[negative]	[21:36]	<unzzi>	Zelta: I had another problem while booting from Hardy CD and I think it's somehow connected to this. I get BusyBox prompt no matter what I chose in the boot menus. I got help for that in the forums but there are several people with this SATA problem and same boot problem which they didn't get help for yet.

[negative]	[21:37]	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, Try running firefox in safe mode and see if it still happens

[positive]	[21:44]	<loosid>	TimMatrix: You should be able to do this from the live CD.  What you need is an application called ndiswrapper (Windows Wireless Drivers is a GUI frontend).

[negative]	[22:22]	<tomd123>	flyback: lol, I guess they screwed up for your hardware then, my internal webcam even works on my laptop now without config's so I guess you got the short end of the stick
[neutral]	[22:22]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ^^^

[negative]	[22:22]	<MrObvious>	VseSlav: What do you want?
[negative]	[22:23]	<flyback>	tom what pisses me off is they appeared to do some kinda locking to the network device eth0
[negative]	[22:23]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: It went to the next line with no reply.
[negative]	[22:23]	<flyback>	so I can't even fix it manually

[negative]	[22:23]	<Shpook>	Quick question: Has anyone found a native solution to get RTL8187 wireless working on a laptop? I'd prefer not to use ndiswrapper, but will if I have to.
[negative]	[22:23]	<flyback>	yes as root
[positive]	[22:23]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, great,
[negative]	[22:23]	<VseSlav>	MrObvious Do Girls write here?)
[neutral]	[22:23]	<flyback>	and the network config tool is *NOT* asking for a password
[negative]	[22:23]	<tdjacr|away>	Can someone review @HLINK for me?
[neutral]	[22:23]	<flyback>	and therefore won't change anything
[negative]	[22:24]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Wow that was fast. Instantaneous. Succeeded and Done.
[negative]	[22:24]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, now, windows is not in your grub config, but don't worry we can get that put in there.
[neutral]	[22:24]	<testola>	"josh04_: yes i tried that. And also to reinstall the nvidia drivers through the ""hardware settings"" in system... That was working fine before... I got the message that screen resolution could not be detected"
[negative]	[22:24]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Ok
[positive]	[22:24]	<tomd123>	flyback: ya, I guess you have a point to move to a different distro then, but I would surely miss the simplicity :)
[neutral]	[22:24]	<patzz>	i'm lost
[negative]	[22:24]	<shane2peru>	what windows are you booting with?
[neutral]	[22:24]	<patzz>	any help??
[neutral]	[22:24]	<shane2peru>	XP, Vista?
[negative]	[22:24]	<MrObvious>	VseSlav: No, this is an Ubuntu support channel. Go somewhere else if you want that kind of attention. But you are more than welcome to stick around and learn about Linux.
[positive]	[22:24]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: XP
[negative]	[22:24]	<flyback>	I do like the interface
[neutral]	[22:24]	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[negative]	[22:25]	<flyback>	other than the bullshit of it not allowing me to override if I have a need to be with root access

[negative]	[22:25]	<testola>	josh04_: Then using xorg.conf.failsafe to restore... but then i get 800x resolution...
[negative]	[22:25]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, one second let me google what the grub line should be for that, wise choice, don't use vista, I have heard nothing but bad. lol
[negative]	[22:25]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yeah. Vista is a resource hog.
[neutral]	[22:25]	<flyback>	heh
[negative]	[22:25]	<testola>	josh04_: thanx anyway.. anyone know of any tutorials on the new xorg.conf file
[neutral]	[22:25]	<flyback>	slackware is better than vista

[neutral]	[22:26]	<mysticdarkhack>	hey all

[negative]	[22:26]	<SlugO>	"Firefox is behaving strangely. Does anyone know why it only adds .com suffix to words that I type into location bar instead of the usual Google's ""I'm feeling lucky"" type of thing"
[neutral]	[22:26]	<oddalot>	hip hip
[neutral]	[22:26]	<MrObvious>	SlugO: Because it's a beta browser?

[neutral]	[22:26]	<oddalot>	hip hip
[neutral]	[22:26]	<josh04_>	testola: the xorg.conf file can be edited in the same way, it just uses autoconfiguration for most of it, so the file in /etc/X11 is a skeleton file
[neutral]	[22:26]	<anemptygun>	hooray
[positive]	[22:26]	<shane2peru>	MrObvious, yeah, I have heard a lot of bad., worse yet they are going to cut XP, that will be cutting their own throat.
[negative]	[22:26]	<Shpook>	Only reason I would like a native solution is because with ndiswrapper, I still had to bind the network to wlan0 every time I booted up. I would prefer it all to be automatic.

[neutral]	[22:27]	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[neutral]	[22:27]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: You can have ndiswrapper run on bootup.
[negative]	[22:27]	<Steven1>	SlugO: I have a problem in Ubuntu with Firefox where it wont let me save bookmarks and all my buttons are gone. So your problem aint much.
[negative]	[22:27]	<MrObvious>	VseSlav: I don't know one sorry.
[negative]	[22:27]	<Felix>	could someone help me ? , in gusty i was able to change screen resolution , select a monitor and configure my video card, but in hardy i can only change resolution , is there a graphical way like in 7.10 to select a monitor and video card for hardy ?
[neutral]	[22:27]	<mysticdarkhack>	to us mozilla-mplayer plugin
[negative]	[22:27]	<VseSlav>	MrObvious :(
[negative]	[22:27]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, we need to mount your hda4 like this:  sudo mkdir /mnt/ubuntu

[negative]	[22:27]	<testola>	josh04_: So if i remove the contents of xorg.conf it will try and reconfigure?
[neutral]	[22:27]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: I don't remember how but it's possible.
[positive]	[22:27]	<Steven1>	Felix: You probably don't have the restricted drivers set up anymore. Mine was the same way.
[negative]	[22:28]	<patzz>	@HLINK Channel is #CA_Priv
[negative]	[22:28]	<Shpook>	MrObvious: That's how I had it before, and ndiswrapper would load but network-manager would never find the network. I had to use iwconfig to bind the network to the interface
[neutral]	[22:28]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, then:  sudo mount /dev/hdb4 /mnt/ubuntu
[negative]	[22:28]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: It's in /etc/modules IIRC and it's just like modprobe ndiswrapper on bootup automatically.
[positive]	[22:28]	<Shpook>	MrObvious: It was pretty annoying. :-)
[positive]	[22:28]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, are ya with me?
[positive]	[22:28]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Unrecognized command.
[negative]	[22:28]	<FooAtari>	hey all.  I seem to have a strange problem.  As od as this may sound, since upgrading to 8.04 I have been unable to login several times.
[neutral]	[22:28]	<VseSlav>	@HLINK
[negative]	[22:28]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: Hmm I never had that when I used ndiswrapper on Gutsy for a while.
[negative]	[22:28]	<xyzpaw>	could anyone tell me what program i have to run to upgrade to 8.04?
[negative]	[22:28]	<FooAtari>	I had to login as root, reset my password for my regular account (which is set to something very straighforward) and then I can login.  but twice my machine has rebooted on its own and I have been unable to login with the password used previosuly.  Anyone got any ideas what would cause thuis?

[neutral]	[22:29]	<Steven1>	disregard
[negative]	[22:29]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, type:  quite
[neutral]	[22:29]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, no I mean : quit
[neutral]	[22:29]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: I think it might be permissions in your home directory in one of the . files.
[negative]	[22:29]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: That's just a guess though.
[negative]	[22:29]	<Shpook>	MrObvious: Well, I just installed Heron on a clean slate, so maybe I'll give it another go with ndiswrapper. I don't want to spend forever fighting with it.
[negative]	[22:29]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yeah just figured that out. Opened a new terminal and ran the command no replies.
[negative]	[22:29]	<tdjacr|away>	Can someone review @HLINK for me?
[neutral]	[22:29]	<acoustyk>	Gnome-do won't launch firefox or pidgin

[negative]	[22:29]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, did you run the mount command too?
[negative]	[22:29]	<Felix>	but my point is , how could I configure my monitor or videocard in gnome ? i was able in 7.10 but that option is gone in 8.04
[neutral]	[22:30]	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: sudo apt-get install distro-upgrade
[neutral]	[22:30]	<loosid>	xyzpaw: sudo aptitude dist-upgrade
[neutral]	[22:30]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yes.
[negative]	[22:30]	<FooAtari>	hmm, ok MrObvious ill see what I can see.  I noticed that onece it was starting klibido that caused the reboot, wonder if there is a permissions issue there.  I reinstalled not long ago so see if that helps
[negative]	[22:30]	<red22>	who was it helping me with mouse/xorg 15 mins ago pls?
[neutral]	[22:30]	<nickrud>	xyzpaw, better is   sudo do-release-upgrade

[positive]	[22:30]	<acoustyk>	is gnome-do working straight out of the repositories for everyone else?
[negative]	[22:31]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, now type this:  sudo cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst.bak
[negative]	[22:31]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: So now Windows will be in the boot load list?
[neutral]	[22:31]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: I would just create a new user and then just move all your documents to the new user's home directory and set stuff up again.
[negative]	[22:31]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ahh, wait
[neutral]	[22:31]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: Then you can delete the old one and use your old user/pass.
[negative]	[22:31]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: 'cp: cannot stat `/boot/grub/menu.lst': No such file or directory'
[negative]	[22:31]	<Felix>	yup i can set resolution there but in 7.10 i was able to change resolution and configure my video card too, how do i configure video card in hardy ?
[negative]	[22:31]	<lastelement0>	hey all, i try to change the icons for AWN yet they always go to the default once i restart. where should i go to change this so they are permanent

[negative]	[22:32]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, that should be:  sudo cp /mnt/ubuntu/boot/grub/menu.lst /mnt/ubuntu/boot/grub/menu.lst.bak
[positive]	[22:32]	<Felix>	of course it is possible to do that  in console mode but is there a graphical way ?

[negative]	[22:33]	<MrObvious>	pr4bh: I doubt anyone will know how to fix that. You just don't have a working CD drive? You could take the drive out and put it in a regular computer and use a laptop to IDE converter.

[neutral]	[22:35]	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: Some.
[negative]	[22:35]	<nickrud>	alabamahit, no reason not to upgrade that I've seen, but waiting a couple weeks (in case some really bad bug crops up) won't hurt
[neutral]	[22:35]	<Jack_Sparrow>	alabamahit, wait a week and watch for problems.. if this is your everyday setup
[neutral]	[22:35]	<testola>	restarting...
[positive]	[22:35]	<FooAtari>	alabamahit, its a step up from 7.10, better hardware support and is LTS so will be supported until 2011 I think it is
[negative]	[22:35]	<xyzpaw>	steven1: why not all?
[negative]	[22:36]	<MrObvious>	alabamahit: I say that just because it's just we need a couple weeks to get things up and running better.

[negative]	[22:36]	<Bidget>	so is hardy out yet? if so how do I update to it?
[negative]	[22:36]	<Anza>	Hi, I have one question. Since I upgraded to the latest Ubuntu version, in most of my mp3 files would appear at the end: (invalid encoding)  and those that have that are wrote in other language or using accents, it's terrible to have to fix it manually on each one, how can I do to make this recognize them??????????
[positive]	[22:36]	<Jack_Sparrow>	alabamahit, support will inpove over the next week as well
[negative]	[22:36]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, great, now when you reboot, it will default to Linux, if you want Windows you will need to scroll down to the bottom.

[negative]	[22:36]	<Jordan_U>	pr4bh, If you can create a bootable iso of the Vista Install CD you could boot from that using GRUB ( or some *NIX bootloader at least, I did it before with knoppix a while back )

[neutral]	[23:18]	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is not frozen.... I had the same experience
[positive]	[23:18]	<Y-Town>	I think im going to be a convert  Kubuntu to Ubuntu.... just seems to work easier  :o)
[negative]	[23:18]	<Bidget>	ferris_, it must be slow cause so many people are updating at once eh
[negative]	[23:18]	<amazen720>	CJS3141: okay

[positive]	[23:18]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, well the sep one is sda6, last time i assigned it as /home in fstab but it doesnt show there
[negative]	[23:18]	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is not frozen.... I was thinking the same things..... I am not sure why it is slow... but you will want new sources.list file
[positive]	[23:18]	<william__>	Y-Town: i like and use them both :)
[negative]	[23:18]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: yes, and I even found a bug report on this, seems to be a kernel problem: @HLINK
[neutral]	[23:18]	<Bidget>	ferris_, what?
[positive]	[23:18]	<qbert>	kde has a ksudo to launch programs that require SU privlidegeds, does gnome having something like that ?
[negative]	[23:18]	<Phoenix92x>	is there a separate channel for hardy problems?

[negative]	[23:19]	<Bidget>	ferris_, what do I have to do with my sources file?
[negative]	[23:19]	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is not frozen.... mine sucked... on my pc, but rocked on my laptop..... so I transferred it and BAM! it was much better than before

[neutral]	[23:20]	<unop>	qbert, not gksudo
[neutral]	[23:20]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: Is it mounted though?
[neutral]	[23:20]	<ShadowCrawler>	can anyone help me get my wireless internet working with a new install of ubuntu
[negative]	[23:20]	<Phoenix92x>	Is anybody else having trouble with virtualbox-ose? When I try to run it it complains that it can't find vboxdrv yet I don't even see that installed by the modules package, just vboxadd.ko. Is anyone else having a similar problem?
[negative]	[23:20]	<krash3x>	Does anyone know about the 32 bit lib compatibility on the nvidia driver on 8.04?
[positive]	[23:20]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, icon shows on desktop?
[negative]	[23:20]	<djlenoir>	ferris, I tried to delete all the existing partitions, and even created a new partition table (wipe everything) in the installer... however, when I reboot, the partition is not gone. I guess it is queueing up the changes but does not apply them?
[negative]	[23:20]	<bigtimer121>	some_person: same errors came up
[negative]	[23:20]	<ferris_>	Bidget, I transferred the sites for the sources.list... but that was from the alternative disc... you may not need to worry about it at all... my laptop was an internet upgrade.... so I am not sure why it kept a better list
[positive]	[23:20]	<bagelong>	josh04: if you are on and can help me again I'll surely love you for ever.  In a platonic way of course
[neutral]	[23:20]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx
[neutral]	[23:21]	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[negative]	[23:21]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, this bug was probably exposed because they chose to move all PATA stuff into the scsci driver.
[positive]	[23:21]	<qbert>	unop: im on ubuntu :)
[positive]	[23:21]	<adaminla>	just downloaded 8.04. How do I check integrity of same?
[negative]	[23:21]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: yes, the drive itself is visible in /dev/ as sdc, but no partitions are there, just as described there.  What would be the correct package to set that bug to?
[positive]	[23:21]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: right click the icon, does it show an option to mount/unmount?
[positive]	[23:21]	<djlenoir>	ferris, I am using Live at the moment, is there a way I can prepare the hdds through Live?
[negative]	[23:21]	<CJS3141>	unop: why not gksudo? qbert wants to run it as root.
[negative]	[23:21]	<Bidget>	ferris_, I see... well, if I have problems with it after I upgrade then I'll see about fixing them I guess. for now I'll just let it upgrade
[negative]	[23:21]	<kindofabuzz>	"i keep getting ""failed to connect"".  so i hit ""try again"" and it will connect.  sometimes i have to hit try again several times.  anyone know what the problem could be?  i assume it's the wireless"
[negative]	[23:21]	<Wolf23>	bruenig:  the channel is on invite? :(
[negative]	[23:21]	<amazen720>	CJS3141: give me a second, I'm burning another disk with magicISO after RAR the files. I have to go in closet to get some old disk, I usual use I Ipod to transfer files
[neutral]	[23:21]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, Unmount option
[positive]	[23:21]	<unop>	qbert, CJS3141 never mind me, i didn't read the question right :)
[negative]	[23:21]	<krash3x>	I didnt install the 32bit libs I was just wondering if I need them for anythign
[negative]	[23:21]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: or should I go over to #ubuntu-devel with that?
[negative]	[23:21]	<Owner>	Hey, I just finished Installing Ubuntu Hardy Via Wubi Installer.
[negative]	[23:21]	<ferris_>	djlenoir, did you finish the writing before rebooting/
[negative]	[23:22]	<bigtimer121>	some_person: same errors again
[negative]	[23:22]	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is a good idea to do that.... it may work fine for you
[negative]	[23:22]	<bigtimer121>	:(
[negative]	[23:22]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: Hmm.  I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you.  Sorry.  Hopefully, one of the more knowledgeable members in here can give you a solution.  Good luck.
[negative]	[23:22]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: ok, lets try reinstalling and uninstalling it
[negative]	[23:22]	<djlenoir>	ferris, I could not finish the writing because my only option was to click Next and it told me I had not set up the partition to install Ubuntu to.
[positive]	[23:22]	<CygnusX1>	Greetings.  Just installed 8.04 on a laptop with mobility x700.  ATI restricted driver installed, yet, fglrxinfo still shows mesa.
[neutral]	[23:22]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: sudo apt-get --reinstall install nvidia glx
[negative]	[23:22]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, not sure about the package, but I'd bet it is a kernel problem.  And if it IS really a kernel problem, it might take a while to get solved, especially if the Ubuntu guys have to wait for upstream.
[neutral]	[23:22]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: then sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx
[negative]	[23:23]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, Thanks for trying, and sorry, i did this a month ago with 7.10 and had no probs
[negative]	[23:23]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if I were you, I'd search the linux kernel mailing list.

[positive]	[23:24]	<Dekkard>	my first clean ubuntu instal since feisty
[negative]	[23:24]	<krash3x>	nope this was the first time I used ubuntu since 5.xx
[neutral]	[23:24]	<towlie>	Dekkard, problems specific to hardy
[negative]	[23:24]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if the problem is already solved in the newer kernels, than it is a matter of getting the Ubuntu devs to include the patch.  OR, you could do it yourself.
[negative]	[23:24]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: the LKML seems to have one entry at least on this, without an answer
[neutral]	[23:24]	<Dekkard>	like?
[negative]	[23:24]	<ferris_>	djlenoir, go ahead and create the partition, click the check box to format and then once it is finished writing the partitions restart the computer (hard reset)
[neutral]	[23:24]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, well i didnt update, did fresh install to try to fix the wireless issue i've had for nearly 5 months
[negative]	[23:24]	<Bidget>	UH OH
[negative]	[23:24]	<ferris_>	you could also get a boot disk and kill the partitions as well
[negative]	[23:24]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, ugh, no answer? bad news

[neutral]	[23:26]	<krash3x>	do we need to install the 32 lib on the nvidia driver with 64 bit
[negative]	[23:26]	<Bidget>	and if it didnt say connection failed, it said connection timed out
[negative]	[23:26]	<InfernoX222>	well i got a DLink DWA-643 that i cant get to work with madwifi or even turn on... I also cant seem to get into a non X server mode to update my nvidia drivers

[neutral]	[23:26]	<Bidget>	?
[positive]	[23:26]	<ferris_>	Xbehave..... you will need to edit the menu.lst file
[neutral]	[23:26]	<mng51971>	then you get no errors
[negative]	[23:26]	<Justin125>	Can someone just tell me if the % drag bar partition option in 8.04 install will be fine for a vista dual boot?

[positive]	[23:27]	<Jordan_U>	Bidget, System -> Administration -> Software Sources -> Mirror -> Other -> Choose best

[neutral]	[23:27]	<Bidget>	k
[negative]	[23:27]	<Xbehave>	i no haw to edit menu.lst but no idea what to add to grub for it
[negative]	[23:27]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, hehehe, I see.  Well, my relatively uninformed opinion is that it is probably a kernel issue, related to the move to the SCSI subsystem for PATA drives.  And if I were you, in this case I'd try to either use an older kernel, or try to recompile the current one turning off this PATA/SATA thing.
[negative]	[23:27]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, hey, before i shutdown and installed 8.04 I copied my fstab to a USB flash drive, would it be safe to just copy and paste that one line into the new fstab? wouldn't use the same UUID?

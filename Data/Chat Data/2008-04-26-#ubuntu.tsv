[positive]	[00:35]	<poseidon>	I try to save my settings to the x configuration file, but it gives me a permission denied
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Abd>	on network manager no wireless card is detected
[neutral]	[00:35]	<josh04>	Tristam: K
[negative]	[00:35]	<teamcobra>	Abd: sorted out in 2.6.25, there was  a weird conflict between your card's driver and the bcm4311rev2 that they just fixed
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Abd>	arrgghh
[neutral]	[00:35]	<mophead>	pelo: 9.04 is *really* brand new

[negative]	[00:35]	<Meshezabeel>	happinessturtle, what version you currently running?
[positive]	[00:35]	<Pelo>	phixxor, full  main and restricted repositories on the dvd , saves on some install download and  both live cd and text install
[neutral]	[00:35]	<seamus7>	happy_tux open system monitor and check what version is says you're running
[neutral]	[00:35]	<IndyGunFreak>	poseidon: you need to run gksudo nvidia-settings
[negative]	[00:35]	<otarid>	Pelo: How would I do that? (reconfiguring x-server)
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Wo0dy>	do you remember, people complained like that when 7.04 was released? As I said, it worked almost perfectly for me, but if people had problems also back then, then I'll upgrade. If 7.04 is known as a better release than it's followers, then I'll stick with it.
[neutral]	[00:35]	<ronartos>	how to know if ubuntu 8.04 detects my video card correctly?
[positive]	[00:35]	<Wo0dy>	guess that the solution is to just fetch a live cd and see how that works for me..
[neutral]	[00:35]	<Pelo>	otarid, sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[negative]	[00:35]	<mophead>	userx86: this is the support channel.  if you need help withi something, please feel free to ask.  If not, just wait around for someone to ask a question you can help them with
[negative]	[00:36]	<Abd>	i guess i'de better backup all my data and make a full install instead of the upgrade and see if hardy detects it
[neutral]	[00:36]	<happy_tux>	it says 8.04
[neutral]	[00:36]	<ronartos>	seems that xorg.conf shows diffrently
[neutral]	[00:36]	<t0dz>	uhm...
[neutral]	[00:36]	<happy_tux>	but it said that on beta i think
[negative]	[00:36]	<Pelo>	Wo0dy, use torrents, save the servers some load

[negative]	[00:36]	<Meshezabeel>	happy_tux, you do not need to upgrade from 8.04 to 8.04
[negative]	[00:36]	<Pelo>	dan__,  youc an't do it with a live cd,  only with the dvd or the alternate install cd
[negative]	[00:36]	<chcampb>	pelo: that second page i hadnt seen, the first i did... it mentioned /etc/samba/smb.conf - i checked that, and there are no passwords in that location.... it does, however, mention the general passwd program - i tried that program, man'd it, and it does not have any flags that will allow me to view/edit the samba password as opposed to the unix password.... and now im back to zero
[neutral]	[00:36]	<Sergiu9>	hello

[neutral]	[00:37]	<Sergiu9>	it is possible to upgrade gutsy alternate with hardy alternate cd?
[negative]	[00:37]	<Pelo>	chcampb,  I don'T realy know anyting about samba you are asking the wrong person

[negative]	[00:37]	<bsrat>	what does the webpage mean by '3 years of free updates'
[neutral]	[00:37]	<Pelo>	t0dz, ask in #xchat
[negative]	[00:38]	<astro76>	Sergiu9: you can use the hardy alternate cd to upgrade... it doesn't matter how you installed gutsy
[negative]	[00:38]	<mophead>	ronartos: you will get a better response if you say which card you are using and what you are running
[positive]	[00:38]	<dan__>	and update manager isnt good for release updates
[neutral]	[00:38]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both

[negative]	[00:38]	<t0dz>	"i puted xx ""for my name"" and then that now my ident.."
[positive]	[00:38]	<bsrat>	as in LTS..
[positive]	[00:38]	<Pelo>	bsrat, means that hardy is gonna get 3 years of support , because it is a LTS ,   the others only get 18 months,   for patches and security fixes
[negative]	[00:38]	<bsrat>	ah ok
[positive]	[00:38]	<teamcobra>	Abd: they're 2 conflicts in the b43 driver in 2.6.24..... I know for certain they fixed it in the new kernel, as I have the bcm4311rev02... been following this issue for a while ;)
[neutral]	[00:38]	<Starnestommy>	t0dz: /set irc_user_name new-ident
[negative]	[00:38]	<Shpook>	Oh no, I've got more problems. I had a failed upgrade last night due to a lost wireless connection(I believe). Now today when I boot up my laptop, it tells me that there is a file system problem on sda1, and forces fsck. The fsck fails, mounts the root files system in read-only, and loads a maintenance shell. Thing is, I never had anything mounted as sda. sda is reserved for USB devices and such, correct?
[negative]	[00:38]	<josh04>	illDecree: Can't help, sorry.
[neutral]	[00:39]	<joetheodd>	Are the repositories still bogged down?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<ronartos>	mophead: Intel 945GM

[neutral]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	t0dz,  can you summerize your issue in one line , this is a busy channel
[neutral]	[00:39]	<andril>	my upgrade went ok so far - but my sourcelist still has some Gutsy items - and I can change the cd to Heron - any help?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	joetheodd, expect it for one week at lest
[neutral]	[00:39]	<cod3rz>	.
[neutral]	[00:39]	<seamus7>	t0dz just go into System/Administration/UsersandGroups to change your username
[negative]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	least
[positive]	[00:39]	<josh04>	Shpook: sda can also be SATA drives
[neutral]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	lol
[negative]	[00:39]	<amenado>	Shpook-> nope
[neutral]	[00:39]	<userx86>	sphook my hard drive partitions are listed as /dev/sda
[positive]	[00:39]	<illDecree>	josh04: you dont think it will work?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	i will tape all in 1
[positive]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	wait a momento :P
[neutral]	[00:39]	<mophead>	ronartos: I can't help, but ask again with all the info
[neutral]	[00:39]	<MrRoboto>	Is Pulseaudio installed by default in Hardy?
[negative]	[00:39]	<joetheodd>	Pelo :(. I agree with whoever said releases shouldn't hit the repositories until torrents have been going for a week or so.
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Starnestommy>	MrRoboto: I think so
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	andril, just uncheck it in the software sources , in the admin menu
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	illDecree: No, i just don't know how to make it work :P Never used an S3 card
[negative]	[00:40]	<MrRoboto>	Starnestommy:  Well I can't see it
[negative]	[00:40]	<Shpook>	josh04, amenado, userx86: so, you're telling me this is bad news then?
[negative]	[00:40]	<Abd>	teamcobra so I guess the problem sis really on my laptop. I'll make a fresh install of hardy, maybe the problems get solved
[negative]	[00:40]	<Jack_Sparrow>	joetheodd, agreed
[negative]	[00:40]	<otarid>	Pelo: reconfiguring xserver didn't work (just asked me about keyboard and mouse)
[negative]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	joetheodd, well at least 24 hrs but tehre are still a lot of ppl that will try and upgrade online
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both
[negative]	[00:40]	<ronartos>	mophead: It's not very specific to my video card.. but how xorg.conf now display settings
[negative]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	otarid, try the binari driver then
[negative]	[00:40]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm not sure what's causing it
[negative]	[00:40]	<andril>	Pelo: i did but there seemd to be less Heron compared to Gutsy
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	Shpook: Not necessarily. It might just be a SATA drive :P
[negative]	[00:40]	<ronartos>	is there anyway I can check which card ubuntu 8.04 detected?
[negative]	[00:40]	<userx86>	sphook i barely understand the nature of your problem, i just know that sda isn't necessarily removable storage
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	otarid,  did you restart X after you reconfigured ?
[negative]	[00:40]	<amenado>	Shpook-> all am saying is sda does not get tied to USB devices
[neutral]	[00:40]	<d4t4min32>	can someone help me with connetion issues, i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager >
[neutral]	[00:40]	<josh04>	otarid: you don't have an intel 965 do you?
[neutral]	[00:40]	<otarid>	no
[negative]	[00:41]	<otarid>	let me try that
[neutral]	[00:41]	<teamcobra>	abd: no
[negative]	[00:41]	<joetheodd>	Pelo, the thing is, I'm still on the old one and I just want to install Azureus. I can't even download headers without timing out.
[negative]	[00:41]	<alienzero>	anybody know how to make the alt+tab behavior revert to the old style (it shows all windows at once)?
[negative]	[00:41]	<teamcobra>	Abd: the problem _won't_ get solved
[negative]	[00:41]	<Pelo>	andril, how did you upgrade anyway ?
[positive]	[00:41]	<bsrat>	can i add a 500Gb sata as primary and boot from that, and have an option to boot from current xp install on secondary sata which is 300Gb?
[negative]	[00:41]	<d4t4min32>	for some reason it just wont connect.. i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager > pasted in paste bin
[neutral]	[00:41]	<joetheodd>	Is there any way to change the timeout that APT uses when connecting to repositories?
[negative]	[00:41]	<illDecree>	josh04: alright... thanks!

[neutral]	[00:42]	<Starnestommy>	mariorz: build-essential
[neutral]	[00:42]	<Pelo>	andril, hmmm,  well you can always edit /etc/apt/sources.list  and comment out the gutsy lines,   just comment them out , don'T delete them  , just incase

[negative]	[00:46]	<mariorz>	mneptok: tough you might want to read it
[negative]	[00:46]	<manfromns>	i tried but there is no surround option

[neutral]	[00:46]	<mariorz>	s/tough/tought
[negative]	[00:46]	<Genotrius>	Well, I'll try it, but I don't think reinstalling it is what I need to do...
[positive]	[00:46]	<mneptok>	mariorz: if you are recommending aptitude, i think you should read it. :)
[neutral]	[00:46]	<josh04>	Tristam: Does it show as installed, present if you type ndiswrapper -l at the prompt? (You don't need to blacklist the modules for this)
[neutral]	[00:46]	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, does the battery charge with the computer shut down?
[negative]	[00:46]	<otarid>	josh04: Resolution is fine now, still have a problem with getting desktop effects and networking to work
[neutral]	[00:46]	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darkside, , does the battery charge with the computer shut down
[negative]	[00:47]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, so its not doing the wpa authentication... have you tried it on an open wifi connection?
[negative]	[00:47]	<KiwiJoker>	mneptok exactly what i was thinking lol
[negative]	[00:47]	<Pelo>	Darkside, isn'T battery recharge a hardware thing ?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Darkside>	well you can control it in the bios too
[negative]	[00:47]	<mneptok>	"mariorz: especially this bit: ""So the points outlined on this page about using aptitude over apt-get are largely irrelevant if you're using Edgy Eft (6.10), Feisty Fawn (7.04), or any future version of Ubuntu."""
[negative]	[00:47]	<nomasteryoda>	someone else please help d4t4min32
[negative]	[00:47]	<Abd>	teambobra thanks for your tips, i'll try to do that. Thanks again

[negative]	[00:47]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: as in typing xmms2? i did that all it says is all the commands like (play, stop, ect)
[neutral]	[00:47]	<nomasteryoda>	have to run
[positive]	[00:47]	<teamcobra>	Abd: I have faith, you'll do just fine ;)

[positive]	[00:47]	<teamcobra>	I redid my first kernel when I was 13 ;) (11 years ago)
[negative]	[00:47]	<mophead>	darkside, pelo: I'm running a toshiba a200 and mine did the same thing for a while
[neutral]	[00:47]	<d4t4min32>	"but my ""linksys"" is open .. now wep"
[negative]	[00:47]	<josh04>	"otarid: I had some trouble getting it to not use the VESA driver. Does it show Driver ""intel"" in xorg.conf?"
[neutral]	[00:47]	<d4t4min32>	*no wep
[negative]	[00:47]	<teamcobra>	and if I could do it then, you definitely can do it now
[negative]	[00:47]	<mariorz>	mneptok: uhm i did? did you?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Darkside>	mophead, did you solve it?
[negative]	[00:47]	<Darknezz>	Jack_Sparrow: im running a PC not a laptop
[neutral]	[00:47]	<Jack_Sparrow>	Darknezz, tab completion error
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Genotrius>	Pelo: It's at the newest installed version.
[positive]	[00:48]	<mophead>	Darkside: I think it sorta solved itself
[negative]	[00:48]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, I think you need to install a packages called xmms2-gtk or somesuch, rigth now you only have  a command line xmms2
[neutral]	[00:48]	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz stick with apt-get bud
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Tristam>	josh04, it reports bcmwl5: driver installed
[negative]	[00:48]	<mophead>	I have no idea how
[neutral]	[00:48]	<cegopaiva>	hi everyone
[neutral]	[00:48]	<mneptok>	mariorz: yes. and i also know what the distro team recommends. and that's apt-get.
[neutral]	[00:48]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: did you see anythign that stuck out as being an issue
[negative]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	thing is, its picking up the battery
[negative]	[00:48]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, there is soemonee else with a nick close to yours we get confused, if you are told battery stuff ignore it
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	and it was discharging from it
[negative]	[00:48]	<mariorz>	mneptok: why? aptitude removes unneeded dependencies when removed
[negative]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	but it can't charge it for some readon :<
[neutral]	[00:48]	<josh04>	Tristam: Are you sure that's the right driver? As in, have you used it before?
[negative]	[00:48]	<doug2266778822>	would using someone elses codec files ruin my comp? if we both have same distro.
[neutral]	[00:48]	<mneptok>	mariorz: and so does apt-get
[negative]	[00:48]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, then its defintely the wpa supplicant causing the issue... might want to seek out wicd ... i would google it ... what i use, but it can have issues with compiz... or so i'm told
[neutral]	[00:48]	<r557>	anyone here use a freedns such as dyndns or another?
[negative]	[00:48]	<Darknezz>	Pelo lol ok
[negative]	[00:48]	<mariorz>	mneptok: and why did the write it if they dont want you to use it
[negative]	[00:48]	<nibsa1242b>	I need help. Prior to upgrade to Hardy I enjoyed using Kate (in Gnome) as an editor. Since the upgrade if I try to open something in Kate nothing happens.
[neutral]	[00:48]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: kk
[negative]	[00:49]	<Abd>	teamcobra each kernel I tried to compile went wrong, but at time i was suing suse 5.3
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Tristam>	josh04, I was using it in gutsy before I upgraded this morning
[negative]	[00:49]	<KiwiJoker>	mariorz i think you missed the point of that blog
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Pelo>	nibsa1242b, sudo apt-get install kate
[neutral]	[00:49]	<mneptok>	mariorz: the distro team did not write aptitude
[neutral]	[00:49]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: i dont follow
[negative]	[00:49]	<Jack_Sparrow>	mariorz, our apt-get is virtually no different that aptitude.. not your average apt-get
[neutral]	[00:49]	<robeph>	doug2266778822: do what?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Jack_Sparrow>	than'
[neutral]	[00:49]	<d4t4min32>	what is wpa supplicant
[neutral]	[00:49]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, also daveyates at lottalinuxlinks recommends it over network manager ... another network manager wicd is
[neutral]	[00:49]	<robeph>	codec a la....?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<josh04>	Tristam: So it should work then. How are you connected at the moment?
[neutral]	[00:49]	<mariorz>	isnt aptitude ubuntu specific?
[negative]	[00:49]	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: its already installed it just doesn't open when I click on it

[negative]	[00:50]	<robeph>	heh you know I've never used aptitude =\
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Pelo>	nibsa1242b, my guess is it is not , you only hve the link in the menu,  install it again
[positive]	[00:50]	<madhamster>	problem: ubuntu fucks up xp when installing
[negative]	[00:50]	<mariorz>	i see, and what is the reason for recomending apt-get?
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Sergiu9>	!codec
[positive]	[00:50]	<ubotu>	For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: @HLINK - See also @HLINK - But please use free formats if you can: @HLINK
[positive]	[00:50]	<robeph>	I always use apt-get =s

[negative]	[00:50]	<carl>	im thinking my mirror doesnt have all the packages
[negative]	[00:50]	<robeph>	still confused as what he meant to someone elses codec and how this could hurt anything
[negative]	[00:50]	<efrancolaporte>	so what do you guys think of ubuntu 8.04
[neutral]	[00:50]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, I'm not saying that's the package name,  check in synaptic,  search for xmms and see what is available
[neutral]	[00:50]	<RoAkSoAx>	after installing compizconfig-settings-manager, does anyone of you seen unchaged option ins System>Preferences>Appearance???
[negative]	[00:50]	<mneptok>	mariorz: apt-get gets improvements written for it. like the ones that page you linked to describe. aptitude does not.
[positive]	[00:50]	<robeph>	efrancolaporte: it's like ubuntu 8 beta =)... with less bugs
[positive]	[00:50]	<astro76>	carl: go to system > admin > software sources, and uncheck the CD as a source
[negative]	[00:50]	<thegattaca>	Simple question ... how does one install ubuntu on a system which only has 256 megs of ram? Tried xubuntu as well, no go ...
[negative]	[00:50]	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: I just reinstalled it. It now works if I click on it from the menu, however, it doesn't open the file if I right click and select open with Kate.
[neutral]	[00:50]	<mophead>	efrancolaporte: this is actuallyu just the support channel... see the topic
[neutral]	[00:50]	<koomber1664>	hmmm. Just installed Ubuntu, but the screen keeps flickering.  Using an Nvidia 8600GT

[negative]	[00:51]	<Genotrius>	So here I am with the latest installed version of ubuntu-desktop, and GNOME not working except for in Failsafe mode. I guess I should try reinstalling ubuntu-desktop in Synaptec, then?
[neutral]	[00:51]	<mneptok>	mariorz: np
[negative]	[00:51]	<cegopaiva>	is there someone brazilian on here? sorry my bad english
[negative]	[00:51]	<robeph>	doug2266778822: theoretically you're not supposed to be able to play dvds I don't think
[neutral]	[00:51]	<carl>	gone
[positive]	[00:51]	<madhamster>	it said on the ubuntu page that you should report bugs here, ubuntu fucks up xp if you install it the newest version
[neutral]	[00:51]	<otarid>	No josh04, it's not really showing any driver there (default screen, different monitor, etc.)
[positive]	[00:51]	<norbi>	Hello, just wanted to stop by and say that I am liking Linux/Ubuntu so far.  First time user, everything so far went smooth.  Had problems with mp3/video/embedded web codecs, but nothing a little googling didn't fix.  Awesome community, keep up the good work.  I am pretty sure if problems show up this place will be of much help.  See you all around :)
[neutral]	[00:51]	<mneptok>	madhamster: language, please
[negative]	[00:51]	<Genotrius>	Or tic, whichever one doesn't mean a touchpad...
[neutral]	[00:51]	<robeph>	doug2266778822:  is it actual DVD format?
[negative]	[00:51]	<Seven_Six_Two>	Those poor upgrade servers...I still can't upgrade without the connection failing
[negative]	[00:51]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: lol how do you search again?
[positive]	[00:51]	<efrancolaporte>	Pelo, yeah i know but you guys are the heroes of linux, if it wasn't for you, 99% would give up, the linux community owes you a lot :)

[negative]	[00:52]	<josh04>	Tristam: As it's not showing up as present in ndiswrapper -l, do you know how to use ndiswrapper -a to set the driver to the device manually?
[negative]	[00:52]	<nibsa1242b>	Pelo: ok, I'm trying that... I'm not quite sure how to do that
[positive]	[00:52]	<madhamster>	mm ubuntu lookd pretty cool actually :) best release I've seen... though this xp fuckup thing is not sweet

[negative]	[00:52]	<Mythril>	Does anyone know how I change the mirrors apt uses (in a non-graphical way?)
[neutral]	[00:52]	<MattJ>	koomber1664: In System->Preferences->Appearance, disable Visual Effects, does it help?
[neutral]	[00:52]	<robeph>	doug2266778822: you may wish to seek support on some of the non distro specific dvd sites about using them in linux
[neutral]	[00:52]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: how hard would it be to install and use this
[neutral]	[00:52]	<sysrpl>	hi

[neutral]	[00:53]	<MattJ>	priman: DVD contains more packages (so you don't need to download them) that's all afaik
[negative]	[00:53]	<Seven_Six_Two>	d4t4min32, I wish I could. I don't know a lot about wireless on linux

[neutral]	[00:54]	<josh04>	Tristam: Ah, must have misread before. Are you sure you're blacklisting both the b43 driver and the ssb driver?
[negative]	[00:54]	<MattJ>	magic_hat: Remove (or comment out the CD lines), and then sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[00:54]	<magic_hat>	MattJ: waht am I looking for? never messed w/ that before.

[neutral]	[00:54]	<d4t4min32>	its open, no encry
[negative]	[00:54]	<josh04>	Tristam: I think there's something else which relies on the ssb driver, might be ohci_usb
[negative]	[00:54]	<mophead>	d4t4min32: explain y our issue, including which version you are running, on what kind of machine, and which wireless care you're using.  that makes it easier to get a response here

[neutral]	[00:55]	<mophead>	d4t4min32: you could also try googling the name of your wifi driver and ubuntu and problem
[positive]	[00:55]	<josh04>	Tristam: Try adding ohci_usb to the blacklist as well. It only runs legacy usb drivers AFAIK, so it shouldn't be a problem

I just upgraded from 7.10 and it used to work great there. Could it be related to the wireless on/off button not working anymore? (it used to be lit when on)?

[negative]	[00:59]	<backlash>	im looking around in network settings
[negative]	[00:59]	<NetEcho>	ah so the issues are probably mirror issues
[negative]	[00:59]	<carl>	NetEcho: there would be possible issues upgrading any OS
[neutral]	[00:59]	<astro76>	WhoNeedszzz: usually a few days
[negative]	[00:59]	<gravemind>	"hey, I'm using the alternate cd on an amd 64 system, and for some reason, the ""DIstribution Upgrade"" application hangs on the first step. What is up?"

[neutral]	[01:00]	<NetEcho>	carl so the issues are probably people not changing the apt mirrors?

[neutral]	[01:01]	<Makgyver>	all
[neutral]	[01:01]	<popey>	moveax: recordmydesktop is good for recording a compiz-enabled desktop, xvidcap isnt
[negative]	[01:01]	<carl>	NetEcho: no prob when you stick in the alternate cd you get a popup with an upgrade button
[negative]	[01:01]	<happy_tux>	then kernel seems to load up
[neutral]	[01:01]	<Tristam>	josh04, still no luck  I'm going to start from scratch and see what happens
[neutral]	[01:01]	<mophead>	squish: afaik, just backup your data, wipe hardy and re-install gutsy online

[negative]	[01:01]	<happy_tux>	then nothing
[negative]	[01:01]	<Pelo>	NetEcho, I'm just recommending the torrents over the website downloads,  easier on the servers
[negative]	[01:01]	<Makgyver>	are there for any silly reason any PowerMac G4 users here

[negative]	[01:02]	<Gun_Smoke>	WhoNeedszzz: I'm having none atm
[neutral]	[01:02]	<NetEcho>	ah thanks
[negative]	[01:02]	<gravemind>	happy_tux: I'm using the alt cd to upgrade, not to install

[negative]	[01:02]	<josh04>	Tristam: Good luck. ssb is the one you need to make sure isn't loading, it claims the card away from ndiswrapper
[neutral]	[01:02]	<WhoNeedszzz>	Gun_Smoke: and how much stuff do u have?
[negative]	[01:02]	<NetEcho>	carl chances are I'll do a complete fresh install since I don't have any important files under 7.10
[negative]	[01:02]	<Makgyver>	I cannot for the life of me get the live CD to boot, I keep getting dropped into initfs
[negative]	[01:02]	<moveax>	popey: well it records it fine, frame-rate wise, but not colour depth wise. It seems it's using a low colour depth, or a very odd colour palett

[neutral]	[01:02]	<mophead>	squish: I'm not sure what yoiu mean... /home is all your personal files e.g. downloads and stuff, so I would recommend backing that up
[neutral]	[01:02]	<backlash>	d4t4min32, i see 127.0.0.1 localhost and 127.0.1.1 bender
[neutral]	[01:02]	<josh04>	Tristam: Np
[neutral]	[01:02]	<d4t4min32>	change the local host to bender

[neutral]	[01:03]	<d4t4min32>	backlash: change the localhost to bender

[negative]	[01:46]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Well if you want performance on the desktop, you might want to look into using either fluxbox or XFCE as your desktop manager, rather than GNOME or KDE
[positive]	[01:46]	<SeaPhor>	Starnestommy: Thanks!
[neutral]	[01:46]	<Pelo>	gravemind, what going on ?
[negative]	[01:46]	<cardstroker>	pelo, again, failed to write status record about libdmx1 to /var/lib/dpkg/status, no space left o n device.

[neutral]	[01:48]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: It can certainly be skinned to look reasonable. I used it for about a year on a 500mhz K6-2 and it was fast enough
[negative]	[01:48]	<Pelo>	dassouki, that's all I have atm check in the forum there was someting about bypassing  pulseaudio ,  that migth help you
[negative]	[01:48]	<gravemind>	Pelo: it's not actually a cd, I'm just mounting the image (which worked successfully 2 other cases
[negative]	[01:48]	<cardstroker>	pelo, I ran apt-get autoclean, is that all I needed to do?

[negative]	[01:48]	<darkcrab>	how do I make videolan media player the default for dvds?
[negative]	[01:48]	<astro76>	Juan: links only work locally.. you need to do it in /etc/fstab, and obviously the network share would have to be connected to earlier in the boot process
[positive]	[01:48]	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  in particular, web browsing
[negative]	[01:48]	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  maybe I should try epiphany
[negative]	[01:48]	<simmerz>	jhow: explain the problem. don't ask if you can ask. just ask
[negative]	[01:48]	<gravemind>	Pelo, I wonder if I should report it as a bug
[positive]	[01:48]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: Never tried XP on it, sorry, so i can't compare. It used to be 98 :P
[neutral]	[01:49]	<Roshane>	Pelo can i upgrade 7.04 to 8.04
[negative]	[01:49]	<gluer>	Q: how do i turn off ip6??
[negative]	[01:49]	<astro76>	Juan: also you would want that share to support Linux file permissions, so that means no samba
[negative]	[01:49]	<Pelo>	cardstroker,  in terminal  gksu nautilus /var/cache/apt   delete .deb file in there that you don'T know you need
[positive]	[01:49]	<dassouki>	pelo,  is it odd that both are decice zereo @HLINK

[negative]	[01:49]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: The key with firefox is to keep the number of tabs at a reasonable amount. Are you running 3.0?
[neutral]	[01:49]	<MattJ>	!br | jhow (maybe helpful)
[negative]	[01:49]	<ubotu>	jhow (maybe helpful): Por favor use #ubuntu-br ou #ubuntu-pt para ajuda em portuguÃªs. Obrigado.

[neutral]	[01:50]	<gluer>	starnestommy: says error module ipv6 is in use
[neutral]	[01:50]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: It's worth upgrading to 3.0 then, it has much less memory leakage
[positive]	[01:50]	<comerc>	thanks matt, would you be able to answer a few questions for me?
[negative]	[01:50]	<Pelo>	thinkingfrog,  recondfigure your video driver

[negative]	[01:52]	<simmerz>	howapt: ah, no idea. i've not come across that yet - upgrading as we speak.
[negative]	[01:52]	<jrabbit>	How do you now change the resolutions accepted, xorg.conf has nothing!
[positive]	[01:52]	<WhoNeedszzz>	astro76: great
[neutral]	[01:52]	<Pelo>	comerc, what video card ?
[negative]	[01:52]	<Abd>	simonft2 I have the same problem. It appears with 2.6.25 the issue is solved. I'm compiling a new kernel and i'll see how it goes

[negative]	[01:53]	<howapt>	simmerz: ah... nevermind then, cheers anyway
[negative]	[01:53]	<Pelo>	acoustyk, state the problem instead of asking for ppl with problem
[neutral]	[01:53]	<jrabbit>	No resolutions are in the display mode
[positive]	[01:53]	<comerc>	i believe it is a radeon 6 or 7000 series
[negative]	[01:53]	<Pelo>	comerc, you don't  I don'T allow private msg, please talk to me in the channel
[negative]	[01:53]	<IntangibleLiquid>	I experience shrinking pages in FF, but this is already the maximum resolution already. What should I do to improve in this?
[neutral]	[01:53]	<simonft2>	ï»¿Abd: 2.6.25 what?
[neutral]	[01:53]	<Skuller>	genii: I read around a bit for dansguardian. It seems slightly complex to get it up and running. Any other alternatives or some simplified help on getting it up and running in as short time as possible?
[positive]	[01:53]	<cardstroker>	"pelo, I got- ""cannot remove /var/cache/apt/archives/partial, it is a directory."
[positive]	[01:53]	<jrabbit>	If the way has changed well where has it changed to

[neutral]	[01:53]	<dassouki>	pelo, is there a way, i can run the sound setup that is used in the ubuntu setup?
[neutral]	[01:53]	<jrabbit>	It's a massive PITA to reat at 1200 x 800
[negative]	[01:53]	<acoustyk>	pelo: flash player is not working in firefox after hardy installation.  Firefox says the plugin is installed but youtube still will not work
[negative]	[01:54]	<Pelo>	comerc, you would do better to use the alternat install cd  , it has a text based installer
[neutral]	[01:54]	<thinkingfrog>	Pelo:  no other installation method worked

[neutral]	[01:54]	<simonft2>	ï»¿Abd: 2.6.25 what?
[negative]	[01:54]	<gravemind>	jrabbit: sounds like the best thing to do is research about your monitor, and then go to a virtual terminal (like ctrl-alt-F3) and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg with the correct information
[negative]	[01:54]	<UaU|Quza>	How can i fix my stuttering microphone? They're hatin me already on teamspeak!!!
[positive]	[01:54]	<thinkingfrog>	Pelo:  except using the nv driver :D

[negative]	[01:54]	<cgentry72>	need some help plz. when i plug in a flash drive nothing happens and never shows up. any ideas?
[negative]	[01:54]	<comerc>	ahhh okay... so that should install on the computer because it is a driver problem probably with the video card?
[neutral]	[01:54]	<josh04>	Josh04: Firefox 3.0, though if these guys are telling you envy that might be more worth it
[positive]	[01:54]	<juls_>	"Trying to install hardy for the first time: getting ""Upper memory..."" error on reboot.  Any solutions?"

[positive]	[01:54]	<gravemind>	jrabbit: but it's an easy fix
[negative]	[01:55]	<NDPMacBook>	Skuller: Easiest way I can think of is to use a router that has parental controls software built in between your DSL modem and the 3 PCs.
[negative]	[01:55]	<simonft2>	ï»¿Abd: how do I upgrade?

[neutral]	[01:56]	<cardstroker>	pelo, I have a new 500 gb hdd.
[negative]	[01:56]	<josh04>	thinkingfrog: You can install firefox 3.0 from synaptic, i think. not sure how new it'd be
[negative]	[01:56]	<howapt>	Does anyone know where the login settings are stored? Since upgrading I now have to log in twice...
[negative]	[01:56]	<acoustyk>	astro76: It was a plugin interference.  I solved the problem but thanks!
[negative]	[01:56]	<Skuller>	NDPMacBook: Yes, that's true. Unfortunately no expenses can be made at the moment to buy additional hardware by the school. Thanks
[negative]	[01:56]	<simonft2>	ï»¿chaqu1: lots of people seem to be having that problem
[negative]	[01:56]	<thinkingfrog>	Josh04:  maybe this is as fast as it's supposed to be, too bad there isn't a benchmark I could use to test it
[negative]	[01:56]	<Pelo>	cardstroker, did you make a seperate partiton for your /  ?
[negative]	[01:56]	<Millertime_018>	hey every automated download that i've tried is failing!
[neutral]	[01:56]	<ToM-X>	Hey, does anyone know how to get Kicker fully working on ubuntu?
[positive]	[01:56]	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  the other thing is, the cpu utilization of firefox...I remember it being less in XP
[neutral]	[01:56]	<Al-Khouli>	hi guys, is there a risk in changing sources.list to have gutsy words replaced with hardy then do an upgrade ?!
[negative]	[01:56]	<Flannel>	Millertime_018: How is it failing?  and what automated download stuff?
[negative]	[01:56]	<nith>	Flannel: thx, I must not have updated my sources file yet. I was kinda hoping it'd be e17
[negative]	[01:57]	<Skuller>	genii: thanks. Sorry to not have found this myself.
[negative]	[01:57]	<NDPMacBook>	Skuller: Then you are pretty much out of luck if you can't get dansgaurdian running.
[neutral]	[01:57]	<Flannel>	nith: e17 isn't out yet
[positive]	[01:57]	<thinkingfrog>	josh04:  even when I'm not doing anything on firefox, it using resources, sometimes a lot
[neutral]	[01:57]	<genii>	Skuller: np
[negative]	[01:57]	<Roshane>	what about softwares that i normally use in windows, can i get those to run on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[01:57]	<Pelo>	Millertime_018,  download of what ?
[negative]	[01:57]	<thinkingfrog>	I should install epiphany, I'll do that now
[negative]	[01:57]	<chaqu1>	simonft2 it says that x server doest not support XrandR
[negative]	[01:57]	<Millertime_018>	my update still doesnt work at all and now my add/remove app wont quit failing on app downloads!
[neutral]	[01:57]	<Pelo>	Al-Khouli, yes there is , don' tdo that
[negative]	[01:57]	<Flannel>	Al-Khouli: It's doable yes, just make sure you have all the proper metapackages, or just let update-manager do it for you.

[negative]	[02:10]	<oddalot>	bagelong: what do you mean by unrecognized?
[neutral]	[02:10]	<Flannel>	aboo0ood_: Changing sources.list won't help, it still connects to the same servers, and through the same libraries.  Try a different mirror (software sources).  You do need to remember that a *lot* of people are trying to get stuff from the mirrors right now, so it is completely possible that its just too slow

[negative]	[02:27]	<jeeves__>	dassouki, how'd you guess?
[negative]	[02:27]	<Pelo>	bagelong, ok it is likely that there is not linux driver for your card,  so you will have to use the windows driver with ndiswrapper,   that,s mentionned in the wifi docs

[negative]	[02:44]	<Pelo>	isdepopecath, no promisses yet,    M$ does not play well with others and Vista is their latest attempt at bullying other OSes from the computers,  might not work

[neutral]	[02:48]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: i got the same error
[negative]	[02:48]	<bjb1959>	anyone know anything about hardy??
[neutral]	[02:48]	<AlienX>	Assid, ?
[negative]	[02:48]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  it says sudo apt-get remove envy <-- i dont understand this?
[neutral]	[02:48]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm confused
[negative]	[02:48]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: making a separate partition for /home is a good idea, but I would choose ext3 if I were you
[negative]	[02:48]	<Assid>	gravemind: oh i had that issue yday.. was converting a guy to TRY ubuntu
[negative]	[02:48]	<Pelo>	bjb1959, what do yo want to know ?
[positive]	[02:48]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, you type that in :)
[negative]	[02:48]	<doug_>	I'm having a problem with the nvidia driver for 8.04 AMD64.  Has anyone seen an actual solution?
[negative]	[02:48]	<bjb1959>	I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<josh04>	bagelong: Just try the apt-get command and if it's already installed it'll just say
[neutral]	[02:49]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, but you don't have to worry about that as you're not upgrading
[negative]	[02:49]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  ok
[negative]	[02:49]	<Assid>	gravemind: finally refused to resize the partition.. and hes like screw it.. and left it on vista
[negative]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	doug_, what is the actual problem ?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<gravemind>	Assid: heh, wow
[neutral]	[02:49]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: so when i make a new i'l choose ext3?
[positive]	[02:49]	<biabia>	bazant that last one is an external. all three drives mount fine if i select the previous kernel but when i select the new one i get an error saying i need to update the driver sd and sr
[neutral]	[02:49]	<ffm_>	Which is better in a mirror, latency or bandwidth?
[negative]	[02:49]	<Assid>	gravemind: yeah.. it ran for over an hour and did NOTHING
[positive]	[02:49]	<bazhang>	biabia: are you able to check their new listings and adjust fstab accordingly? able to mount them manually?
[negative]	[02:49]	<doug_>	a black screen ... can get to ttys ok
[negative]	[02:49]	<senghoo>	HI ~ ALL
[neutral]	[02:49]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error @HLINK
[negative]	[02:49]	<bjb1959>	Pelo I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
[neutral]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	bjb1959, check i menu > syusetm > admin > users check your user's permission  to shutdown
[positive]	[02:49]	<nucco>	ffm_: both :) higher bandwidth, lower latency is better
[neutral]	[02:49]	<bagelong>	josh04:says I am good to go aready.
[negative]	[02:49]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes. now right now, are you running on the live cd, or are you installed already?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<AlienX>	ffm_, that's kind of a silly question as both factors are important
[negative]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: then i'l have 2 filesystems whit ext3
[negative]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	AlienX, I realize that.
[negative]	[02:50]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: wrong link?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<kbrooks>	question
[neutral]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i have instaled allready
[negative]	[02:50]	<josh04>	bagelong: type ndiswrapper -l, it shoul say no drivers isntalled
[neutral]	[02:50]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes, however you also need a swap partition
[negative]	[02:50]	<kbrooks>	how do i show the time directly on my desktop?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	doug_, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from the recovery mode
[negative]	[02:50]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: of about 1 gb in size
[neutral]	[02:50]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is there a wlan0 in iwconfig?
[negative]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	AlienX, I mean is a mirror with higher latency but higher bandwith better than a close mirror with less bandwith?
[neutral]	[02:50]	<bazhang>	ffm_: bandwidth but kinda offtopic here
[neutral]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	kbrooks, gdesklets, or screenlets
[negative]	[02:50]	<bjb1959>	Pelo Oh that's right, I forgot about making sure permissions are set right after upgrade. thanks I'll try that first
[neutral]	[02:50]	<doug_>	thanks ... I'll try it
[neutral]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	kbrooks, or conky or gtkrll
[negative]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: oky. but how will thath efekt my system whit 2 ext3 systems?
[positive]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	bazhang, Not really, this is about ubuntu repo mirrors.
[negative]	[02:50]	<LainIwakura>	Hello.. I installed this font and it shows up in xfontsel but not in any drop-down fonts menu. How do I actually use the font? Thanks for any help.
[negative]	[02:50]	<AlienX>	ffm_, neither is an indication of what download speeds you'll actually get
[negative]	[02:50]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  igot this E: Couldn't find package envyng
[negative]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	Alright, downloading.
[negative]	[02:51]	<evilbug>	Pelo- i completely re-installed gutsy and installed all the updates for it,and now when i log in it gets stuck on the light brown screen.
[neutral]	[02:51]	<kbrooks>	Pelo, ty
[negative]	[02:51]	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings, but i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
[negative]	[02:51]	<seriouslycgi>	anyone help me with samba configuration its kinda dead in the samba channel?
[neutral]	[02:51]	<bazhang>	ffm_: you creating one?
[neutral]	[02:51]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i wont loose all the files i have now?
[negative]	[02:51]	<nucco>	ffm_: probably... unless your pipe is smaller than the lower mirror, and you think it won't be crowded
[negative]	[02:51]	<bagelong>	josh04:  in the terminal?  Nothing happended
[neutral]	[02:51]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, cd to the directory where you downloaded envy
[neutral]	[02:51]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error configure: error: *** GTK+ >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first ***
[neutral]	[02:51]	<Darknezz>	 (HAHAHA sorry)
[neutral]	[02:51]	<ffm_>	bazhang, No.
[positive]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	evilbug- install hardy :)
[neutral]	[02:51]	<cygoku_>	How are the repositories feeling right now ?!?!
[neutral]	[02:51]	<cardstroker>	rkvirani, what ya got?
[negative]	[02:51]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: it doesn't make a difference in how your system will run, it's just a little bit safer to have /home on a separate partition. but you don't really have to
[neutral]	[02:51]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, though i *think* ubuntu has some tool that'll let you just click on the package and it'll install for you
[positive]	[02:51]	<nucco>	ffm_: or use bittorrent and forget about bandwidth issues :)
[negative]	[02:51]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm stuck.  I can't figure out why that keeps failing
[negative]	[02:51]	<evilbug>	osxdude- that didn't work,the install gave me crap :|
[neutral]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	cygoku_, I think they are good
[neutral]	[02:51]	<ffm_>	nucco, that won't work for APT, will it?
[positive]	[02:51]	<josh04>	bagelong: Hold on while I find you a link
[neutral]	[02:51]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: the reason you can't resize your existing partition is because you're running on it
[positive]	[02:51]	<bazhang>	ffm_: what is the exact nature of your issue then? just curious/chat or have actual issues creating a mirror
[negative]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	evilbug- what kind of crap?
[neutral]	[02:52]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, install the related -dev package , look in synaptic
[neutral]	[02:52]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  i dont download the envy, coz i dont know where is the download package
[positive]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: if you boot up from the live cd, you will be able to resize it
[positive]	[02:52]	<nucco>	ffm_: :p silly me :p
[neutral]	[02:52]	<ffm_>	bazhang, I'm choosing a mirror for my systems.
[negative]	[02:52]	<Pelo>	ok I'M going on a brake, later folks
[neutral]	[02:52]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it's on the page.
[neutral]	[02:52]	<cygoku_>	Cool.
[neutral]	[02:52]	<ffm_>	nucco, I bittorrent the ISOs of course...
[neutral]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: maybe that's what you should do, if you don't want 2 partitions
[negative]	[02:52]	<nucco>	ffm_: latency generally won't affect the speed of the download
[negative]	[02:52]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it'll be something like envyng.deb or something
[negative]	[02:52]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i did but it still dont work
[negative]	[02:52]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i want to have 2 partisjons
[negative]	[02:52]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, 1 sec,,
[negative]	[02:52]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i almost installed all the files
[positive]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: good :)
[neutral]	[02:52]	<trippingmonke1>	does anyone here have any experience with the NVIDIA 169.12 driver in hardy?
[negative]	[02:52]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: but i don't wanna lose the files i already have in /home
[neutral]	[02:52]	<josh04>	bagelong: Can you type lspci and copy me the line referring to Broadcom?
[positive]	[02:53]	<bazhang>	ffm_: best to hold off on choosing; the ones you choose now may not be the best because of the recent release of hardy
[positive]	[02:53]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: thanks
[negative]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: ok, we will be careful, and not lose them
[negative]	[02:53]	<binarybandit>	hey all, trying to install with wubi, and I just get dropped to an initramfs shell on reboot
[negative]	[02:53]	<evilbug>	osxdude- a bunch of install errors.
[negative]	[02:53]	<hdevalence>	hmm, would it be possible to have the gutsy->hardy updater download packages via torrent?
[neutral]	[02:53]	<seriouslycgi>	im trying to share a folder on a default install (ubuntu 7.10 server) of samba and im following a tutorial online to add the folder, but when i try to browse it in midnight commander it shows up but i cant desend into it. (error: cannot change directory) ive set up my user and password and enabled that user and the directory is owned by the same user details and has read write exe? my smb.conf @HLINK
[negative]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: I'll look for the guide that tells how to do what we're trying to do
[neutral]	[02:53]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, yes
[negative]	[02:53]	<supertimmy>	how do i change the theme in hardy? what kind of theme files do i need to download?
[neutral]	[02:53]	<bagelong>	josh04: 0c:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4310 USB Controller (rev 01)
[neutral]	[02:53]	<mayakuza>	gravemind oky
[negative]	[02:53]	<bazhang>	hdevalence: would be nice but no
[negative]	[02:53]	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings for those drives,   i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
[positive]	[02:53]	<evilbug>	osxdude- i got gutsy to work now :) nevermind.

[neutral]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: @HLINK
[negative]	[02:53]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Do any networks show up in nm-applet then?
[neutral]	[02:53]	<osxdude>	awww man
[negative]	[02:54]	<Andross>	hello all, I'm having trouble with my laptop running hardy, it doesn't seem to want to bring up the onboard eth0 and I can't get wireless working without it
[neutral]	[02:54]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: ty
[negative]	[02:54]	<ffm_>	bazhang, I get 1.9miB/s on MIT, and pretty much the same on olsol.
[positive]	[02:54]	<evand>	binarybandit: try adding edd=on to the kernel command line.
[positive]	[02:54]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: sure thing :)
[neutral]	[02:54]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  u tols me to openhere--> @HLINK

[negative]	[02:54]	<binarybandit>	the first time I attempted the install, it worked, but the partitioning tool failed with error code ten, so I uninstall, and tried a reinstall
[negative]	[02:54]	<supertimmy>	leo_rockw: i am downloading themes from there but can't find how to import them
[positive]	[02:54]	<binarybandit>	evand, mmk, thanks
[negative]	[02:54]	<bazhang>	biabia: not sure if the instructions have changed for hardy; and you have the old ones around may you not try those out?
[negative]	[02:54]	<mojo>	I've been using XChat for a few years but decided to try xchat-gnome.  Seems nice and clean but how do I remove join/part messages?
[negative]	[02:54]	<leo_rockw>	supertimmy: oh, ok... i can't help you there, i'm a kde fanboi
[negative]	[02:54]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, how do i get there?
[positive]	[02:54]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, yes, go to that web page
[negative]	[02:54]	<evand>	binarybandit: if that doesn't work, cat /casper.log at the initramfs prompt, shift page up and look for errors
[negative]	[02:54]	<ffm_>	bazhang, Is there a program I can run that will do so automatically? The GUI just does latency.
[neutral]	[02:55]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, follow the directions there
[neutral]	[02:55]	<bazhang>	ffm_: nice to know thanks
[positive]	[02:55]	<binarybandit>	thanks :)
[negative]	[02:55]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: It's the one in the top right shaped like a computer
[negative]	[02:55]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, then you should have working nvidia drivers

[negative]	[02:55]	<biabia>	bazhang: ok i dont remember checking the listing for the drives would you know the command for that
[positive]	[02:55]	<evand>	binarybandit: also, removing 'quiet splash' from the kernel command line (escape at grub, e, then e on the kernel line) will show you more information
[positive]	[02:55]	<Andross>	I need to know how to get a driver to control a certain network interface, I know it should happen automatically, but it isn't
[negative]	[02:55]	<hdevalence>	bazhang: how hard would it be to do for next time?
[negative]	[02:55]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i have 2, 1 for lan and 2 for wlan
[negative]	[02:55]	<thinkingfrog>	if composite is enabled in xorg.conf, but compiz effects aren't used, will there be a performance benefit?

[negative]	[02:56]	<bazhang>	hdevalence: you mean instead of dpkg/apt/aptitude?
[neutral]	[02:56]	<bagelong>	josh04: It's downloaded.
[positive]	[02:56]	<biabia>	bazhang: it does now, but i am on the older kernel. i will reboot and try it
[positive]	[02:56]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is your router turned on ;)
[neutral]	[02:56]	<AlienX>	"Wolf23, see where it says ""get envyng""?"

[neutral]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	!terminal | enaner
[positive]	[03:18]	<ubotu>	enaner: The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Guide: @HLINK
[negative]	[03:18]	<jstritar>	"my problems started when it tried installing ""lopenofice-org-writer2latex"" then a lot of things failed after that"

[negative]	[03:18]	<ffm_>	jstritar, The problem is when you use a lot of packages unsupported by ubuntu.

[neutral]	[03:18]	<josh04>	SUGAR
[negative]	[03:18]	<osxdude>	enaner: I know ou can have KDE in Ubuntu, but I do not know how.
[negative]	[03:18]	<jstritar>	ffm_: do you know where i can at least see a log of the install? /var/log/apt doesn't have it
[negative]	[03:18]	<Nutzebahn>	Hi. Does anyone know of any fingerprint scanner software that will work on Ubuntu?
[negative]	[03:19]	<Pelo>	gooody, pidgin and amsn do I think

[neutral]	[03:19]	<mikebot>	ffm_: Haha, touchÃ©!
[negative]	[03:19]	<MewRS>	nucco: could not read /dev/sdb
[negative]	[03:19]	<jstritar>	ffm_: even so, it shoudl recognize packages that aren't supported and at least warn you
[negative]	[03:19]	<darkcrab>	yea, I only unchecked the ones like crash reporter. or like bluetooth because my system doesnt have bluetooth.
[neutral]	[03:19]	<MewRS>	nucco: but the pendrive blinked..
[neutral]	[03:19]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, ? thats the same one i sent b4?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn, did you check in the repositories ?  menu > sytem> admin > synaptic
[neutral]	[03:19]	<xyzpaw>	is ssh for hacking?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	jstritar, It did, when you first installed them.
[positive]	[03:19]	<nucco>	MewRS: second time I'm seeing that today, means the drive is probably gone for good
[negative]	[03:19]	<slashzul>	how do you add gnome desktop on a ubuntu server install?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<osxdude>	no, xyzpaw
[negative]	[03:19]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: what do you mean by hacking?
[negative]	[03:19]	<seriouslycgi>	mikebot, theres more channels like #lfd (linux for dummies) ##linux etc so if one is really overloaded try in another chan that what i do
[negative]	[03:19]	<ffm_>	mikebot, Seriously, Canonical has paid support, that's how they stay aflote.
[negative]	[03:19]	<gravemind>	how does mozilla feel about including firefox 3 beta 5 in a production release?

[negative]	[03:19]	<jstritar>	ffm_: yeah, well when they don't support the latest graphics cards you have to do that
[negative]	[03:19]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, what should have changed? i made no changes?
[negative]	[03:19]	<MewRS>	nucco: =( no chance of ressurect?
[neutral]	[03:19]	<Pelo>	xyzpaw, go to wikipedia.com and search for ssh or secure shell
[neutral]	[03:20]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: hacking is not what you think it is...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<jstritar>	ffm_: they shouldn't pretend like you can upgrade
[positive]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Well, it can be used by malicious black-hat hackers.
[negative]	[03:20]	<Starnestommy>	xyzpaw: it's usually used for remote administration of servers
[neutral]	[03:20]	<xyzpaw>	can you use ssh to anonymously torrent
[negative]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	jstritar, They don't _pretend_.
[negative]	[03:20]	<Peddy>	ï»¿can someone tell me how to bring back window shadows in Hardy?
[positive]	[03:20]	<darkcrab>	mozilla has always encouraged people to use its test releases rather than its stable releases.
[negative]	[03:20]	<nucco>	MewRS: if the partitioning software can't access the drive, I can't think of what next to do, sorry
[neutral]	[03:20]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: you can use ssh to control rtorrent, for example
[negative]	[03:20]	<slashzul>	how do you add gnome desktop on a ubuntu server install? gdm?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	"jstritar, When you install ""community supported software"" it isn't supported by canonical."
[negative]	[03:20]	<gooody>	Pelo: pidgin doesn't support voice and videos yet. i'm not sure of the amsn yet.
[negative]	[03:20]	<Pelo>	xyzpaw, you are thinking of proxy servers , google for tor
[neutral]	[03:20]	<mikebot>	seriouslycgi: Thank you, I wasn't aware.
[negative]	[03:20]	<MewRS>	nucco: ill try the mkfs on entire drive, so..
[neutral]	[03:20]	<artenius>	lewench: hit numlock
[negative]	[03:20]	<d33d>	I need to fix my Firefox 3.05b flash, for some reason its like screwed up...In order to play any flash I have to click some stupid Circle with an arrow in it, and it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt...any ideas?
[negative]	[03:20]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: I'm not best sure, to be honest
[neutral]	[03:20]	<Zaqq>	installed heron using wubi ... installed nvidia drivers and some apps .. restarted ... booting halts with a (initramfs) prompt...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<mikebot>	ffm_: Right, but this is the free support channel, correct?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<Nutzebahn>	Pelo, yes, I did. Help?
[negative]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	slackd00d, just gnome, or the whole ubuntu desktop thing?
[negative]	[03:20]	<MewRS>	nucco: if everything is already messed up, there is nothing to lose, right?
[neutral]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	mikebot, Yes.
[neutral]	[03:20]	<nucco>	MewRS: my verdict though, is that the drive is history. and mkfs on the entire drive won't work either.
[neutral]	[03:20]	<osxdude>	!proxy
[positive]	[03:20]	<ubotu>	Many Ubuntu IRC channels prohibit access from !proxies such as !TOR and web (Java, etc) gateways due to a high level of abuse. You can however obtain a hostmask cloak: see @HLINK
[positive]	[03:20]	<jstritar>	ffm_: that doesn't mean ubuntu should upgrade without warning you it might break your entire system
[neutral]	[03:21]	<lewench>	artenius, ITS ON!
[negative]	[03:21]	<xyzpaw>	how do you use ssh to control rtorrent?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<MewRS>	nucco: Kingston R.I.P.
[neutral]	[03:21]	<w30>	xyzpaw: ssh is a secure version of telnet that can't be intercepted to get keystrokes for login names and passwords (greatly simplified)
[neutral]	[03:21]	<slashzul>	does GDM install add desktop to a server instsall?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<xrc>	you don't use ssh to control torrent
[negative]	[03:21]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: i'm pretty sure there are many tutorials out there on the internets. i never used rtorrent myself
[positive]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	jstritar, Uh, that's implicit in any upgrade. You should always back up data, but especially with system updates.
[negative]	[03:21]	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn,  that's where i look when I want software,  you can try google , Ihave no more suggestion but I've seen it mentioned on digg I think ,
[neutral]	[03:21]	<osxdude>	Lol, I have the same EXACT type of Kingston memory in the family computer right now
[negative]	[03:21]	<jstritar>	ffm_: do you know of way of trying to resolve upgrade issues?
[positive]	[03:21]	<MewRS>	nucco: no way to try to write a disklabel from term? :P
[negative]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Basically, it is easier for malicious people to hack into you if you use telnet.
[negative]	[03:21]	<josh04>	xyzpaw: You ssh in, run screen, open rtorrent, set it up, detach from screen and log out of ssh
[neutral]	[03:21]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: but rtorrent is not anonymous
[negative]	[03:22]	<totocool>	hi all I`ve just installed KDE 4 but the panew went away and don`t know how to start it
[neutral]	[03:22]	<Pelo>	slashzul, more or less, it,s part of a desktop

[neutral]	[03:22]	<ffm_>	!helpme > totocool
[positive]	[03:22]	<nucco>	MewRS: you can do that via an argument to mkfs, but that particular drive is hosed :)
[neutral]	[03:22]	<josh04>	MewRS: I presume parted can do it, but I don;t know how
[neutral]	[03:22]	<Pelo>	totocool, ask in #kubuntu or #kde
[positive]	[03:22]	<leo_rockw>	josh04: he's going to ask you what screen is now :-P
[positive]	[03:22]	<ffm_>	jstritar, Best way is a fresh install, but what's the broken package?
[negative]	[03:22]	<jstritar>	ffm_: i don't know b/c i closed the window and there's no log. but after restarting i have no network & the video is messed up
[negative]	[03:22]	<bjb1959>	Pelo, your suggestion didn't work. can't find anything in system>admin>users about logoff or shutdown and setting authorizations doesn't work either any more ideas?
[negative]	[03:22]	<jstritar>	ffm_: a lot of packages failed near the end

[positive]	[03:36]	<nucco>	my guess is: wubi copies some files to a place on your windows drive, then creates a boot loader entry, and prompts for reboot. when you reboot, you can launch the installer without necessarily modifying your bios.

[neutral]	[03:47]	<ToddEDM>	Legendario:  i dont think so
[negative]	[03:47]	<Dr_willis>	oddalot,  you may want to try audacious, or bmpx instead.   Compiling may take a bit of extra things needed to be installed first

[negative]	[03:58]	<Pelo>	ruewan, gksu is just a prefix command to run the command ias root,  it needs a command after
[neutral]	[03:58]	<miggilinme>	Yes, the connection with the new driver is horrid
[positive]	[03:58]	<gravemind>	thinkingfrog: they are added to the kernel as 'modules' somehow

[negative]	[03:58]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i followed this once, maybe i'll try again
[negative]	[03:58]	<Starnestommy>	thinkingfrog: they can usually be compiled as a module then loaded into the kernel without compiling it into the kernel
[negative]	[03:58]	<Dr_willis>	thinkingfrog,  normally 'drivers' are modules loaded by the kernel as needed, thus making the proper /dev/devices for the hardware or other things

[negative]	[03:59]	<gravemind>	thinkingfrog: they can be compiled into the kernel I think, but most ppl don't
[neutral]	[03:59]	<thinkingfrog>	"so, restricted drivers, they are modules that are ""loaded"" into the kernel"
[negative]	[03:59]	<Pelo>	samy, in linux you assume wrong, in linux new means troubleshooting ,  old means stable and reliable
[negative]	[03:59]	<miggilinme>	is there any way to get back to the old driver?

[positive]	[04:01]	<Dominoes>	does anyone here use an MX revolution with 8.04?
[negative]	[04:01]	<Jordan_U>	thinkingfrog, It simply uses apt to download the corrosponding package, for gfx drivers it then changes the driver section in /etc/X11/xorg.conf and when X starts it uses modprobe to load the module
[positive]	[04:01]	<josh04>	Bagelon1: It was my fault you crashed, I mucked up one of the commands

[positive]	[04:02]	<LiraNuna>	Pelo, 1.2.26 was available for quite some time
[negative]	[04:02]	<Pici>	linkinxp: Not unless theres a security bug or something makes it into backports.  We don't have a rolling release like Debian.
[negative]	[04:02]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i've done it twice before at least, but who knows and a big THANK YOU! for trying, if you wake up in the middle of the night with a dream answer for my issue,,, go back to sleep, i'll be around tomorrow, (unless they take my CAT5 while i'm sleeping!)
[positive]	[04:02]	<thinkingfrog>	is Linux like windows, in that sometimes uninstalling and reinstalling drivers can fix problems?

[positive]	[04:21]	<USN1520_>	sl4y3r no, I believe it should change...but make sure you have installed all available upgrades

[neutral]	[04:33]	<Assid>	gaspipe1: considering 7.10 is outdated.. 8.04 now
[negative]	[04:33]	<seamus7>	Arno: have you looked for Advanced Desktop Effects in the System/Preferences menu?
[neutral]	[04:33]	<Jordan_U>	NetEcho, Basically, but to be clear it still allows you to choose to load NT / boot windows at boot

[negative]	[04:34]	<NetEcho>	Jordan_U yea what I thought... thats actually pretty handy
[negative]	[04:34]	<TropicalDude>	Assid: well Im considering what's best for my dual core works fine, no problem doing a fresh install actually, and I had gutsy and then update maybe I have some problems with the update, so Im wondering the best path
[negative]	[04:34]	<ruewan>	i noticed that i can use my finger print reader to log more than once now
[positive]	[04:34]	<bazhang>	Assid: gaspipe1 gutsy is still supported as is hardy (7.10 is not outdated)
[negative]	[04:34]	<seamus7>	Arno: that's it then

[positive]	[04:34]	<Arno>	LogicalDash, ok, thanks :)
[positive]	[04:34]	<darkcrab>	Is there no-one who can tell me if firefox 2 is installed by default alongside firefox 3 in hardy heron??
[positive]	[04:34]	<Alex_Sc2e>	It's not all that noticeable a difference since I've updated, although it is a bit faster
[negative]	[04:34]	<bjron>	anyone know what is responsible for automounting a cd when you put it in the drive?

[negative]	[04:35]	<ruewan>	i like that i can save my password for mounting my windows partition as well
[negative]	[04:35]	<Assid>	TropicalDude:  personally if you have a decent amt of ram.. and want to make use of a dual core.. i'd go with 64bit
[neutral]	[04:35]	<Assid>	gaspipe1: nah.. just update it via synaptic
[neutral]	[04:35]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: you can add medibuntu repos for hardy
[negative]	[04:35]	<gaspipe1>	Assid: ok
[negative]	[04:35]	<darkcrab>	mophead my problem is it is installed in my applications and I dont remember it being there, and I am concerned.
[negative]	[04:35]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: and then you can upgrade from synaptic
[negative]	[04:35]	<seamus7>	darkcrab ... it is not ... did you upgrade? maybe you had installed FF2 in a separate location?
[negative]	[04:35]	<InGunsWeTrust>	TropicalDude: if you wanna use zsnes dont do 64 bit! AH!
[negative]	[04:35]	<Arno>	can someone please tell me how to add Shadows behind windows in Compiz?
[neutral]	[04:35]	<jmknsd_>	netyire: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[negative]	[04:35]	<jmknsd_>	my bad
[neutral]	[04:35]	<Assid>	zsnes ?
[negative]	[04:35]	<Alex_Sc2e>	I would not go with 64 Bit: Programs have major issues, also many bugs come up. I had it on my other PC, and it was horribel
[negative]	[04:35]	<darkcrab>	No seamus I did not  upgrade.
[negative]	[04:35]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: so i wud have to reinstall it?
[negative]	[04:36]	<TropicalDude>	Assid: I got 3GB ram
[positive]	[04:36]	<darkcrab>	This is a fresh install
[neutral]	[04:36]	<Assid>	people play snes roms yet?
[neutral]	[04:36]	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, Do you have the firefox-2 package installed?
[negative]	[04:36]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: no real need for 64 bit at this point; very few apps and many things can be more work to get going
[negative]	[04:36]	<darkcrab>	Jordan_1 yes , but I did not install it, thats the problem
[negative]	[04:36]	<tuchki>	hi. someone have a ati radeon express 200 installed correctly?
[negative]	[04:36]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: if it's not a fresh install then no. you just need to make sure you have the hardy repos for it so you can update when needed
[positive]	[04:36]	<Wyzard>	"What is the ""nvidia_new"" driver?  How's it different from the regular ""nvidia"" driver?"
[positive]	[04:36]	<m2geek>	tuchki nope, i have a 9600 pro that works :)
[negative]	[04:36]	<seamus7>	darkcrab where do you see FF2? how did you become aware of it being on your fresh install of Hardy?
[negative]	[04:36]	<mophead>	"Arno: I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find just by googling ""compiz"""
[negative]	[04:36]	<netyire>	jmknsd_: thanks! any clue as to how to determine if its a prescott, northwood, etc from the make and stepping though?
[negative]	[04:36]	<enaner>	how do i enable proprietary drivers
[positive]	[04:36]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i upgraded so now it wasn't a fresh install
[neutral]	[04:36]	<mophead>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[04:36]	<darkcrab>	It showed up in my applications list seamus7
[negative]	[04:36]	<InGunsWeTrust>	TropicalDude: typically with 64 bit you get about 15% better CPU performance but use about 15% more RAM
[neutral]	[04:37]	<tuchki>	mine is not workin good
[neutral]	[04:37]	<tuchki>	i cant change resolution
[neutral]	[04:37]	<Assid>	Alex_Sc2e: what kinda issues?

[neutral]	[04:37]	<ubotu>	enaner: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see @HLINK
[negative]	[04:37]	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, You can safely remove it if you want to, one possability I can think of is that you installed a package containing a firefox plugin which depends on FF2
[negative]	[04:37]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: how do i check to make sure i have the repos?
[neutral]	[04:37]	<cvd-pr>	any now how i adjust the  brigthness in VLC?

[negative]	[04:37]	<m2geek>	are proprietary drivers much point? I tried em once and it totally screwed things up for me.
[negative]	[04:37]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: do you know what /etc/apt/sources.list is?
[negative]	[04:37]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: I think because Im a n00b I will put 64bit on stand by, so now I have to 1) fresh install 2) Figure out to make work dual core.
[negative]	[04:37]	<darkcrab>	OK jordan_1, I will check that now.
[negative]	[04:37]	<seamus7>	darkcrab: how do you know it's FF2?
[neutral]	[04:37]	<darkcrab>	It says firefox 2 seamus 7
[neutral]	[04:37]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: why re-install?
[negative]	[04:38]	<jmknsd_>	netyire: nope
[negative]	[04:38]	<Wyzard>	TropicalDude: You shouldn't need to do anything for your dual-core to work
[negative]	[04:38]	<agmishra>	How do I add myself for sharing allowed user in hardy?
[neutral]	[04:38]	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: the 32bit binaries dont work on 64bit for zsnes?
[neutral]	[04:38]	<bagelong>	josh04: This is safe _only_ if driver bcmwl5 is meant for chip in device 14E4:4315
[negative]	[04:38]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ahh i think so... is that the list where it shows ubuntu where to find updates?
[positive]	[04:38]	<seamus7>	darkcrab is FF3 there as well?
[positive]	[04:38]	<bazhang>	Wyzard: he has the 386 (not generic ) kernel
[neutral]	[04:38]	<josh04>	bagelong: it is
[negative]	[04:38]	<Wyzard>	ah
[neutral]	[04:38]	<Dr_willis>	TropicalDude,  check what kernel you are running also. I noticed on one machne i somehow had the 386 kernel installed when i needed the -generic kernel.
[negative]	[04:38]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: because I cant see dual activity CPU
[negative]	[04:38]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: yup either check that file or the medibuntu file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
[neutral]	[04:38]	<Assid>	Wyzard: not about makin it work.. but just  performs better
[neutral]	[04:38]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: if it says gutsy, change it to hardy
[negative]	[04:38]	<Gun_Smoke>	What's the name of package to add the temp sensors to the panel?
[negative]	[04:38]	<bagelong>	josh04:  Looks like we are close.  Now what?
[negative]	[04:38]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ok
[negative]	[04:38]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: install the generic kernel then
[negative]	[04:38]	<agmishra>	when I want to share something, the dialog says I don't have permission to share
[negative]	[04:39]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: nope i found a 32 bit deb and did --force-architecture on it but it doesnt work
[neutral]	[04:39]	<josh04>	"bagelong: ""ndiswrapper -l"""
[negative]	[04:39]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: then if any update is available you'll just get it through synaptic
[positive]	[04:39]	<bjron>	lol, good thing I DL the xubuntu alt install disk - probably not a good plan to upgrade my ubuntu install from that :p
[positive]	[04:39]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: how :)? from synaptic?
[neutral]	[04:39]	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: strange.. technically 32 bit binaries should work on it
[negative]	[04:39]	<LoLeN_Original>	i had downloaded some packages (a LOT) from another computer, and then burnt them to a cd having used AptonCD; then i installed them at another system; and now Synaptic tells me that all of them are autoremovable. How can i fix it so that they are shown just installed?
[positive]	[04:40]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: that would be best choice yes--be sure it is the 24 and not the 22 however (if this is an upgrade and not a fresh install)
[negative]	[04:40]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: i know! that is why this problem is particularly annoying. zsnes is the only program that I want that i cant use! otherwise I love hardy (as I have loved every upgrade of ubuntu)
[neutral]	[04:40]	<bazhang>	LoLeN_Original: this is gutsy or hardy

[neutral]	[04:40]	<darkcrab>	seamus7 I can use firefox2 and firefox3 as seperate browsers.
[neutral]	[04:41]	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust:  you filed a bug in launchpad?
[neutral]	[04:41]	<bazhang>	LoLeN_Original: and the aptoncd was from a gutsy system?
[neutral]	[04:41]	<LoLeN_Original>	bazhang: nop, hardy too
[negative]	[04:41]	<darkcrab>	Jordan, there is nothing there to indicate that I installed a firefox2 plugin.

[negative]	[04:41]	<seamus7>	did you add anything at all to Hardy Heron since you did your fresh install ... anything additional?
[negative]	[04:41]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: but depending on how you got the repos it might be in a different file
[negative]	[04:41]	<tuchki>	someone have problems in hardy?
[negative]	[04:41]	<Geoffrey2>	is there a Heron specific set of instructions for getting wireless up and running?

[negative]	[04:41]	<darkcrab>	just flash, and java, and thats about it.
[negative]	[04:42]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid: nope, cuz it isnt a bug, there have been seperate 32 and 64 bit packages for zsnes since 6.10 I figured there was just something about the program that made it had to be specially compiled
[neutral]	[04:42]	<darkcrab>	a gdm theme
[negative]	[04:42]	<swilky>	 hey all dose any one know where i can get a GOOD sorce list that WORKS for australian sources

[negative]	[04:42]	<bazhang>	swilky: I just gave you an answer
[negative]	[04:42]	<LoLeN_Original>	bazhang: are you looking at it?
[neutral]	[04:42]	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: so that would make it a bug.. if its working in the past versions and now doesnt
[negative]	[04:42]	<darkcrab>	oh and some pidgin guifications
[negative]	[04:42]	<swilky>	oh that you Xd
[neutral]	[04:42]	<swilky>	XD
[positive]	[04:42]	<seamus7>	darkcrab did you do a fresh install but keep your home folder from a previous installation separate in its own partition?
[neutral]	[04:42]	<InGunsWeTrust>	assid; good point
[positive]	[04:43]	<darkcrab>	no seamus7, this is an absolute default fresh install.
[neutral]	[04:43]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: mine says Hardy when i did that cmd
[positive]	[04:43]	<Jordan_U>	swilky, Use System -> Administration -> Software Sources, it has a feature to automatically find the fastest repo for you
[neutral]	[04:43]	<Assid>	InGunsWeTrust: file a bug

[negative]	[04:44]	<bjron>	gah, you'd think they'd maybe put the links to the torrents on some server that wasn't also letting ppl dl the full image
[positive]	[04:44]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: thanks , now trying
[neutral]	[04:44]	<seamus7>	darkcrab ... hmmm mystery ... just uninstall FF2 from synaptic .. or uninstall both FF2 and FF3 and then reinstall FF3 .. perhaps you inadvertently downloaded and installed an older beta versino of Hardy that had both

[negative]	[04:46]	<darkcrab>	what I am wondering is do you think I am being hacked or anything.
[positive]	[04:46]	<seamus7>	darkcrab: then logic would dictate you did something which led to its installation .... that you can't remember what that is is beside the point :)

[positive]	[04:47]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: installing, thank you very much, will post how it does when done.
[positive]	[04:48]	<darkcrab>	:) yea, thats why I finally decided to ditch windows, was hoping to leave the security problems behind.
[neutral]	[04:48]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i think it's right... i was reading it and if i'm not wrong it says that i installed ubuntu from a 7.10 disc which is correct
[neutral]	[04:48]	<bazhang>	TropicalDude: will require a restart
[positive]	[04:48]	<josh04>	bagelong: good luck :P
[negative]	[04:48]	<ruewan>	would uninstalling gksu be a bad thing
[negative]	[04:48]	<darkcrab>	well, I guess I will just try to uninstall firefox 2 then.
[positive]	[04:48]	<TropicalDude>	bazhang: great!
[positive]	[04:48]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, well, it is certainly much harder but at the same point there is still _some_ paranoia that's needed to be secure ;)
[neutral]	[04:48]	<pebi>	nt
[negative]	[04:48]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: so you have gutsy?
[positive]	[04:49]	<Jordan_U>	darkcrab, If you were being hacked they probably wouldn't change anything noticeable, this is a great answer because it both alleviates your fear that this is a sign of being hacked and makes you more paranoid at the same time :)
[negative]	[04:49]	<bjron>	has anyone got a link to the amd64 torrent?  I can't get to @HLINK . . it's being unresponsive
[neutral]	[04:49]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i upgraded to gutsy
[positive]	[04:49]	<bazhang>	dmsuperman: just need to get away from windows long enough and that feeling will dissipate ;]
[neutral]	[04:49]	<Zelta>	Is there a way to use my Zune in Ubuntu without having to use a virtual machine
[negative]	[04:49]	<Odd-rationale>	Hey, Assid! Sorry. I was away...
[negative]	[04:49]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: but the medibuntu repo is not in that list
[positive]	[04:49]	<bazhang>	bjron: you may want to choose a different mirror in the near term for that
[neutral]	[04:49]	<darkcrab>	lol Jordan
[neutral]	[04:49]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: go to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory
[negative]	[04:49]	<bazhang>	Zelta: sadly no
[negative]	[04:50]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ok i will try to get it fresh via terminal
[neutral]	[04:50]	<Zelta>	D:
[negative]	[04:50]	<leo_rockw>	gaspipe1: and see if you have any file named medibuntu
[neutral]	[04:50]	<Zelta>	bazhang: Do you have a Zune?
[neutral]	[04:50]	<Assid>	err whats the difference between gnome/openbox and gnome
[negative]	[04:50]	<regis>	hello,i have a problem with nvidia drivers: i can startx after : killing X server(because of the failsafe mode),rmmod nvidia insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/volatile/nvidia_new.ko and then startx...but how can i make the module load and remplace the stock nvidia
[positive]	[04:50]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, no, i certainly agree that it's harder but randomly following directions that others give (sometimes even in this very channel) can lead to some negative effects, so it still takes a bit of common sense ;)
[negative]	[04:50]	<tuchki>	somebody know how to configure a grafic card ati radeon express 200 in hardy?
[neutral]	[04:50]	<bjron>	bazhang: ah good point - the torrent files are probably up on the other mirrors by now (yesterday not so much)
[neutral]	[04:50]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	has the repos cooled down yet?
[negative]	[04:50]	<saltedlight>	anyone know if evolution calendar alarms works even if evolution is closed?
[negative]	[04:50]	<cob>	nope
[negative]	[04:51]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: ok
[negative]	[04:51]	<dmsuperman>	ubuntung-pinoy, I expect it'll be at least a few more days until it's back to somewhat normalcy
[positive]	[04:51]	<pdelgado>	is there a version of ubuntu that will run on G4 processors? (for an iBook)
[negative]	[04:51]	<regis>	modprobe nvidia_new doesn't load the nvidia_new kernel module...i think i must edit the modules configuration files at /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic
[positive]	[04:51]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	:-(
[negative]	[04:51]	<bazhang>	Zelta:  nay, but have read extensively on ubuntuforums--you may see if they have any new news on that front---> www.ubuntuforums.org

[positive]	[04:52]	<ubotu>	PowerPC.  Formerly used by Apple for the Macintosh line of computers. Variants are now used in popular gaming consoles. PPC was a fully supported Ubuntu architecture up to and including edgy. It is now a community port, see @HLINK
[positive]	[04:52]	<Wyzard>	"regis: The ""Hardware Drivers"" window has nvidia_new checked as being enabled, but it still says ""not in use"""
[neutral]	[04:52]	<rich_freecomm>	...or 9 hours
[negative]	[04:52]	<Assid>	how do i change usplash back to ubuntu's usplash from kubuntu ?
[negative]	[04:52]	<seamus7>	Assid: good luck ... that can sometimes be tricky ...  do some searches via google and the ubuntu forums .. you need to make sure you have the graphic in the right location and there's a link which needs to point to it ..
[neutral]	[04:52]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	ï»¿pokerfacepenguin: how exactly?...........
[negative]	[04:52]	<dmsuperman>	What is the suggested tool for making a full disc image backup of my filesystem? It's roughly 6GB, so my plan is to then break it up into 2 pieces and burn to DVDs, or copy to an external hard drive
[negative]	[04:52]	<eaglestar83>	i was using ubuntu beta before should i do reinstall?   sometimes now firefox crashes
[negative]	[04:53]	<rich_freecomm>	maybe they should have an option to see size of how much needs to be downloaded and G/M/K/bytes downloaded
[negative]	[04:53]	<Assid>	err wait
[negative]	[04:53]	<Wyzard>	regis: turns out that's because the nvidia-glx-new package isn't seen as being available, because the installer apparently didn't download any package lists during installation
[negative]	[04:53]	<eaglestar83>	should i reinstall stable version?
[positive]	[04:53]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: i think it wrked... right after i reinstalled it, a pop up for 5 updates came on with mediabuntu
[negative]	[04:53]	<bagelong>	josh04:  Still don't see a wireless option in the network manager.  Do I need to do something else?
[neutral]	[04:53]	<regis>	Wyzard: ah...mabe try manualy: killall Xorg log into console,rmmod nvidia,insmod /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic/volatile/nvidia_new.ko, startx and look at the dmesg logs
[neutral]	[04:53]	<pokerfacepenguin>	ubuntung-pinoy: sounds like you are already commited.   been a while...u can probably do a google search to get a howto....basically, just point your repos to a different location...especially a more local one
[neutral]	[04:53]	<bazhang>	eaglestar83: no need; just keep updating an d you will be final
[negative]	[04:54]	<regis>	Wyzard: ah ok so install it...i used envyng manual installation...
[negative]	[04:54]	<eaglestar83>	yeah ok why is firefox working crazy now sometimes i have to send kill to close it
[negative]	[04:54]	<Jordan_U>	ubuntung-pinoy, Are you trying to find a faster apt mirror?
[negative]	[04:54]	<Wyzard>	"regis: Actually, all I did was ""sudo apt-get update"""
[negative]	[04:54]	<tuchki>	somebody know how to configure a grafic card ati radeon express 200 in hardy?

[neutral]	[04:55]	<eaglestar83>	no extensions

[negative]	[04:58]	<Karshin>	"Question, I tried to login as root, but ubuntu doesnÂ´t allows me to do it, says ""You canÂ´t login as root from here"" how I can log in as a root?"

[negative]	[04:59]	<regis>	Wyzard: yes...when it startx it goes in failsafe mode unless i insmod nvidia_new manualy
[negative]	[04:59]	<Karshin>	The reason I want to log in as root is for not having to write the password each time I want to do something, like access my hd
[positive]	[04:59]	<Jordan_U>	ubuntung-pinoy, No, from the main menu ( it will affect where Add / Remove downloads from though )
[neutral]	[04:59]	<Karshin>	specially if Im offline

[neutral]	[05:00]	<gaspipe1>	leo_rockw: @HLINK

[positive]	[05:04]	<ubotu>	killerkiller: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[negative]	[05:04]	<Wyzard>	jsoftw: working in a root shell is OK if you know what you're doing, of course
[neutral]	[05:04]	<jsoftw>	regis: yes and so can the user.
[neutral]	[05:04]	<roocraig>	can anyone help me resolve a startup issue?
[neutral]	[05:04]	<leo_rockw>	Ooglez: you can check out your card model with lspci
[negative]	[05:04]	<B_166-ER-X>	oh, Its either Hardy that still should be in Alpha Release, or 'me'    but its a fresh install. and almost everything is goin haywire.  I dont have any sound, A black screen on 1 on 2 reboot (besides of the Gdm login screen)   ect..ect. I need serious help (mostly with these 2 problems) I'm with Ubuntu since Hoary, and i never seen it this buggy.    :(
[negative]	[05:04]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, Do you know where else I might be able to get KDar from then?
[negative]	[05:04]	<Luckrider>	does anyone here have the beta still, can anyone help me upgrade from the stupid beta to the now released version, I have been waiting all day for the update, and still none, BTW, I am in Eastern US in case people were wondering what server i was on
[negative]	[05:04]	<killerkiller>	my appearance settings are messed up. i can't change my background and it freezes.
[neutral]	[05:04]	<Vlet>	gapagos: run then from a terminal like: ./somebin.bin
[neutral]	[05:04]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	Jordan_U: It was set for Servers for Philippines; will changing it to Indonesia be better, coz my fabulous country doesn't have its own
[positive]	[05:04]	<Luckrider>	any help is appreciated
[positive]	[05:04]	<gapagos>	Vlet thank you!
[neutral]	[05:04]	<regis>	jsoftw: the user can't modprobe
[negative]	[05:04]	<josh04>	bagelong, do you want to just call it a day?
[positive]	[05:04]	<killerkiller>	the appearance settings dont work.
[neutral]	[05:04]	<jsoftw>	regis: so?
[positive]	[05:04]	<seamus7>	Luckrider: you are likely already in the final release ..
[neutral]	[05:04]	<bazhang>	dmsuperman: best to install from repos; if you *must* have it this second you might check at getdeb.net
[neutral]	[05:04]	<bagelong>	josh04: sure.  What  are my options from here do you think?
[negative]	[05:05]	<Scunizi>	I just installed server and on top xubuntu-desktop. I've got wired and wireless interfaces installed. Wired works. Wireless (Atheros AR5212/5213) isn't recognized or listed under network but shows up when with lspci in terminal.. how do I activate it
[negative]	[05:05]	<Vlet>	gapagos: oh, you'll probably have to do this first: chmod +x somebin.bin
[negative]	[05:05]	<jsoftw>	regis: if the user eve sudo's, then there you go, potential for problems right there.
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Luckrider>	is there a way to check seamus7?
[neutral]	[05:05]	<jsoftw>	Even normal linux exploits.
[negative]	[05:05]	<regis>	jsoftw: ok

[negative]	[05:05]	<JPSmon>	What if I ran Wubi in Wine?
[neutral]	[05:05]	<Starnestommy>	jsoftw: sudo logs things, unlike a direct login as root
[negative]	[05:05]	<regis>	Wyzard: so what should i do?
[positive]	[05:05]	<seamus7>	Luckrider have you been getting updates on a daily basis ever since you installed the Beta? you can check System Monitor and it should say 8.04
[negative]	[05:05]	<bazhang>	JPSmon: that is not the way wubi works
[neutral]	[05:05]	<jsoftw>	*sigh*
[neutral]	[05:05]	<killerkiller>	can someone help me with my appearance settings.
[neutral]	[05:05]	<karllenz>	How come my awn manager keeps failing?
[negative]	[05:05]	<jsoftw>	Look nevermind. You guys can hug your sudo
[neutral]	[05:06]	<josh04>	bagelong: You just need to get ndiswrapper working, which shouldn't be too hard. It's either the windows driver we've used or the ssb driver interfering, though i'm leaning towards the former
[neutral]	[05:06]	<Luckrider>	seamus7, yes I have
[neutral]	[05:06]	<SimplePlan>	"when i try to install limewire it says ""Only one software management tool is allowed to run at the same time"" i dont think im runnin ne thing else ... what shud i do now??"

[neutral]	[05:06]	<JPSmon>	lol i know bazhang its a joke
[negative]	[05:06]	<neil_d>	JPSmon: that sounds an odd thing to do.
[neutral]	[05:06]	<F3d0rA>	something of that nature?
[negative]	[05:06]	<Vlet>	killerkiller: perhaps your video card is not supported by compiz?
[negative]	[05:06]	<josh04>	bagelong: but i'm too tired to make heads or tails of it atm
[neutral]	[05:06]	<Skuller>	bazhang: which plugin?
[negative]	[05:06]	<jamiejackson>	 latest ubuntu loads some modules out of order, so i want to re-order them with a script that runs at boot time. the script will unload and reload the modules that were previously loaded out of order. can you help me figure out where these linesshould go? (new script, existing script, etc.?). i'm going to be telling many others where to put this script, so i wanna get it right
[neutral]	[05:06]	<roocraig>	anyone here help me with startup problem--i am a newbie and have trouble starting up ubuntu
[neutral]	[05:06]	<bazhang>	jsoftw: you may be comfortable with another distro if you love root so much; the 'ubuntu way' is sudo not root thanks
[negative]	[05:06]	<Flannel>	SimplePlan: Are you running update-manager, or apt-get or Synaptic?
[negative]	[05:06]	<dmsuperman>	bazhang, Yeah, I was hoping to backup my harddrive overnight. It doesn't have it, and kdar.sourceforge.net won't load. Do you have any particular suggestions for full disc backup? I just need to backup /, minus a few dirs, and have it not follow symlinks to different filesystems
[negative]	[05:06]	<Vlet>	roocraig: specific questions are better
[negative]	[05:06]	<seamus7>	Luckrider; then you have been updating to the new release bit by bit everytime you had an update ... so there was no big update for you yesterday ... you had already arrived at the final
[negative]	[05:06]	<SimplePlan>	flannel i dun think so ... how do i find out

[negative]	[05:07]	<Flannel>	SimplePlan: Do you have any other windows open?
[neutral]	[05:07]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: is there an '/etc/rc.local' file
[negative]	[05:07]	<Luckrider>	ok, I thought so, just wanted to check seamus7, thanks

[positive]	[05:07]	<Jordan_U>	"ubuntung-pinoy, Whatever the ""select best server"" feature gives you is the best you are going to get ( for now, other servers may be faster once the rush to upgrade to Hardy dies down )"
[positive]	[05:07]	<ubotu>	pawan: Ubuntu can be installed in a lot of ways. Please see @HLINK for documentation. Problems during install? See @HLINK Don't want to use a CD? Try @HLINK - See also !automate

[neutral]	[05:07]	<B_166-ER-X>	!sound
[negative]	[05:07]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[negative]	[05:07]	<bazhang>	dmsuperman: you might consider sbackup; you can /msg ubotu backup for more suggestions/links
[positive]	[05:07]	<josh04>	bagelong: night :P
[positive]	[05:07]	<jamiejackson>	no, neil_d , this is a fresh install, and it's not there
[positive]	[05:07]	<Karshin>	I still think vistaÂ´s UMC its a pain in the ass, LinuxÂ´s password system is even harder.
[negative]	[05:07]	<jsoftw>	bazhang: and please, ubuntu is a distro. People can use it how the hell they like

[neutral]	[05:08]	<SimplePlan>	flannel any solution?
[neutral]	[05:08]	<seamus7>	Luckrider that's because you have all the updates and upgrades at this very moment
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Luckrider>	yup
[positive]	[05:08]	<jsoftw>	bazhang: what you are pushing is a cushion on all sharp edges approach
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Vlet>	Luckrider: apt-get upgrade only updates installed packages

[negative]	[05:08]	<regis>	anyone? how do i install modules into the config files that are in /lib/modules/2.6.24-16-generic
[neutral]	[05:08]	<Karshin>	flannel: isnÂ´t about knowing my password, is about having to write it each time I want to do something
[positive]	[05:08]	<seamus7>	when more are available you'll get a notification in the notification area

[negative]	[05:09]	<Vlet>	gapagos: sounds good
[negative]	[05:09]	<Flannel>	Karshin: its only when you want to do something administrative.  Which, may seem like a lot right now, but once you've had your OS for a month or so, you'll hardly ever.
[negative]	[05:09]	<SimplePlan>	"ï»¿when i try to install limewire it says ""Only one software management tool is allowed to run at the same time"" i dont think im runnin ne thing else ... what shud i do now??"

[negative]	[05:10]	<Luckrider>	that is what I want, thatnks vlet
[positive]	[05:10]	<seamus7>	karllenz I believe it is recommended that you use the Testing Package for AWN ...

[neutral]	[05:28]	<Bassoon>	I can put the headphones in, but sound will still come out of the speakers AND the headphones.
[negative]	[05:28]	<kevykev>	Hi all, how do I get my sound to work?
[negative]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	oh wait! I had a couple of those  before. I forgot how long ago it was. It wasn't recent
[negative]	[05:28]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I suppose it depends on the exact definition of 'service', these scripts get run to start different things at init time.
[neutral]	[05:28]	<Drezard>	in regards to wireless connections...
[negative]	[05:28]	<Nikonlappy>	you can use root .. there isnt a big problem with it.. but its frowned upon with this OS
[negative]	[05:28]	<seamus7>	nano_ yes but it works in Ubuntu/gnome
[negative]	[05:28]	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  the update manager  never ask you to do a partial-upgrade?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<bazhang>	roocraig: can you startup in recovery mode?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<nano_>	seamus7: sweet,tnx
[negative]	[05:28]	<Geoffrey2>	why does it seem Ubuntu is no longer capable of automatically detecting wireless networks?
[negative]	[05:28]	<roocraig>	how do you do that?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	not recently, cvd-pr
[positive]	[05:28]	<shally87>	Nikonlappy: thanks
[negative]	[05:28]	<baudthief>	my install will likely break after a reboot, and I'm gonna need to start over - I've just backed up ~/home, are there any other dirs I need to back up that might contain personal files/info

[positive]	[05:28]	<roocraig>	bazhang: do you think it is that graphics setting?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<Bassoon>	Geoffrey2, for me it seems to update slower.
[neutral]	[05:28]	<bazhang>	roocraig: get into the boot menu and choose it there
[negative]	[05:28]	<jamiejackson>	neil_d: if i add a script in there and make it executable, will just doing those two steps make it run at init time?
[negative]	[05:28]	<chicobo329>	I can remember at least two. but not at any recent time around the release date
[negative]	[05:28]	<shally87>	bazhang: ok..thanks a lot.. and so how do i learn how to use the server version?

[negative]	[05:29]	<keycool1>	bazhang: did you see my paste?
[negative]	[05:30]	<Nikonlappy>	Geoffrey2: try the forums if you have no luck
[neutral]	[05:30]	<bazhang>	shally87: best to get a desktop and then install LAMP on top--especially as you are new to this; alternately you could install ubuntu-desktop to that (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) and work from there --if you do not wish to reinstall
[negative]	[05:30]	<Shadow420>	how can I fix my login screen it's too big for my monitor?
[negative]	[05:30]	<backdraft>	Tried that one unknown fs
[negative]	[05:30]	<chicobo329>	well I guess I could technically be on a release, but I had no major updates leading up to the release day
[negative]	[05:30]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I would sugjest you put your command in that rc.local file, maybe just something that wont cause trouble to start with.  like load a module you don't need as a test.
[negative]	[05:30]	<roocraig>	bazhang: i am going to try that and I will reenter the chat and tell you if there was any luck-ok?

[positive]	[05:31]	<xim>	my ? is if I backup my home dir and then reinstall linux and copy the home folder back in, will I need to manually reinstall all the packages, or is there a list of installed packages saved somewhere in the home dir that can be restored all at once?
[negative]	[05:31]	<bazhang>	keycool1: could you paste it to pastebin and then give me the link (please dont paste in the channel again thanks)
[negative]	[05:31]	<Nikonlappy>	B166erx: nothing quick here
[negative]	[05:31]	<seamus7>	maybe you just need to update grub ... first back up your menu.lst ... then sudo update-grub
[negative]	[05:31]	<roxygirl>	does anyone know anything about watching full episodes (ie. from abc.com) from canada....is it an isp problem or a linux incompatibility?

[negative]	[05:32]	<seamus7>	chicobo329 maybe you just need to update grub ... backup menu.lst first ... then sudo update-grub
[negative]	[05:32]	<Makgyver>	ok I am burning the ISO in MAC OS X under Toast, lest see if this works for the PowerPC
[negative]	[05:32]	<Shpoo1>	I'm in the process of upgrading right now, and it's installing all the new packages. Quite of bunch of them couldn't be installed, whether due to missing dependencies, corrupt packages, or other reasons. Most were open office packages, but I can't remember all of them.

[negative]	[06:24]	<dmsuperman>	amenado, Right, which I figured would either take all the mounted drives with it or it wouldn't. It's obviously not, because then the dump would be well over 200 GB. However, / is only using 4.5GB, so I'm just wondering where the extra 15GB of data comes from

My only idea so far is to use the nofollow flag when executing so it won't follow symlinks, but other than that I'm still drawing a blank as to where it gets the extra data. it's not copying the mounted drives, because it would be much bigger, but it's also not just copying the files from the partition, because it would be smaller

[negative]	[06:55]	<sam__>	its really obnoxious
[negative]	[06:55]	<leo_rockw>	WGGMk: but i've been using gnu/linux for a longer time than that...
[negative]	[06:56]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Koheleth: xfce is just meant to be lighter than nautilus, whats good about it depends on the user and how much resources they can use
[neutral]	[06:56]	<Koheleth>	I see
[negative]	[06:56]	<androver>	sam, just a guess, CPU scaling probably isn't working in ubuntu
[negative]	[06:56]	<Koheleth>	Baby_Shambl3s, arnt you meant to be in jail?
[negative]	[06:56]	<sam__>	so does that mean my CPU is doing too much work?
[neutral]	[06:57]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Koheleth: o_o dont spread it around
[negative]	[06:57]	<androver>	kind of, yeah.  lemme find you a reference that tells you how to fix it.
[negative]	[06:57]	<dmsuperman>	Alright, I'm now backing up my full partition, excluding any extra data (such as /proc, /media, etc.) where are all the main places ubuntu uses for extra data that I can delete? For example, before backing up windows I would flush the temporary internet files, and the prefetch, to save room
[neutral]	[06:57]	<androver>	sam__: try this: @HLINK
[negative]	[06:57]	<Claan22>	"how do I use the 'make' command?  the instructions I'm following say ""It can be done by make, so only type in make into the console, when you are in the driver main directory. ""  I have the directory open in the file browser, then I switch to the terminal and type 'make', and it says that there's no target"
[neutral]	[06:58]	<androver>	Claan22: you have to cd to that directory in the console first
[neutral]	[06:58]	<Koheleth>	prolly got net access in nick
[negative]	[06:58]	<Claan22>	androver: ah.  how do I do that?
[negative]	[06:58]	<McGod>	How do I create a startup script
[negative]	[06:58]	<unop>	Claan22, you probably need to run ./configure first -- but do read the INSTALL/README file first, it varies from package to package
[neutral]	[06:58]	<McGod>	I need to startup my network
[neutral]	[06:58]	<androver>	"just type ""cd <directory here>""..."
[positive]	[06:58]	<albech>	does ubuntu support diskless install? booting from a nfs mount?
[neutral]	[06:58]	<unop>	albech, sure
[negative]	[06:58]	<androver>	"if you want to get to /usr/local/bin/foo, you type ""cd /usr/local/bin/foo"""
[positive]	[06:59]	<unop>	without the quotes :)
[negative]	[06:59]	<OldSocks>	I have a problem. I installed 8.04, and the only thing that makes me ticked off is I can't access my D:\ drive. I installed using Wubi, and I installed ubuntu onto my D drive. However when I boot up ubuntu, I can only access my C drive. Anyone know a fix?
[negative]	[07:00]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	"Claan22: it dont work like that you have to go into the directory using cli (command line) so it would be cd /""than directory path > once inside the director make wait for it to make and than sudo make install (make sure you have buil-essential installed)"
[negative]	[07:00]	<Claan22>	YES it seems to be working, thanks guys
[neutral]	[07:00]	<gooody>	is there any way to edit icon settings in ubuntu gutsy?
[positive]	[07:00]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: you should be able to get at the D drive ehhh look in
[neutral]	[07:00]	<androver>	no prob
[positive]	[07:00]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Err well is drive D a second partition on the first physical disk - or is it its own physical disk
[neutral]	[07:00]	<cool>	gooody, System>Preferences>Appearance
[positive]	[07:00]	<seamus7>	gooody you can install different icon sets in Appearances ... you change individual icons by right-clicking an app and choosing properties
[positive]	[07:01]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: it is a second partition on my main disk. I was able to access D with 7, but with Hardy, I don't see it.
[negative]	[07:01]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: like unop said you might have to run ./configure first than make, you can also try make check just incase to see if you have all dependencies
[negative]	[07:01]	<sam__>	weird, i cant open CPU frequency scaling monitor in my taskbar
[neutral]	[07:01]	<sam__>	how can i find it
[negative]	[07:01]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Is it NTFS or FAT32 ?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: NTFS logical
[negative]	[07:01]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: brb - something is wrong with my client - gotta reboot it
[neutral]	[07:01]	<unop>	Claan22, it's always recommended you read the INSTALL/README files before making assumptions and running ./configure or make
[negative]	[07:01]	<led3234>	how do i install the propietery (sp?) drivers?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<cool>	sam__, you installed it?
[negative]	[07:01]	<Claan22>	how do I use ./configure?  make is giving me 'error 2', so I figure that's the problem
[negative]	[07:01]	<androver>	"sam__: it doesn't show up when you right-click on the taskbar and say ""add to panel""?"
[positive]	[07:01]	<Pinky>	whew, I finally got ubuntu 8.04 installed :)
[negative]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	Ok well that was odd
[negative]	[07:02]	<Claan22>	unop:  I'm following instructions on the internet, they just tell me to make it
[negative]	[07:02]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently
[neutral]	[07:02]	<sam__>	add new item?
[negative]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	all my responses decided to be white
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	anyway
[neutral]	[07:02]	<androver>	"it's called ""add to panel"" on mine, I'm on hardy."
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: So NTFS partition... ok.. so you should be able to hit it at /media/sdb I think
[positive]	[07:02]	<seamus7>	Any strong reason to do a fresh install rather than an upgrade?
[negative]	[07:02]	<OldSocks>	Baby_Shambl3s: yea I know that, but I can't access my D drive, even though its called something else.
[negative]	[07:02]	<unop>	Claan22, trust the instructions in the INSTALL file over anything else - they are probably more authoritative than anything else
[negative]	[07:02]	<cool>	sam__, This would help --> @HLINK
[neutral]	[07:03]	<gooody>	seamus7: i want to change the way my icon display in the desktop. i don't like the way pdf, images and other files displayed as thumbnails like on my desktop.
[negative]	[07:03]	<Daniel15>	"Hi everyone... I just upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04 and keep getting ""You are not allowed to access the system configuration"" when I try to go to items in System -> Administration (eg. Networking)"
[negative]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: Hmm, I'll give it a try. Got to reboot into ubuntu.
[negative]	[07:03]	<Daniel15>	Any ideas how to fix that?
[positive]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	Thanks.
[negative]	[07:03]	<oddalot>	"ahhh...here is the problem  ""checking whether build environment is sane... yes  ""   <--lol, this should say no"
[negative]	[07:03]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: first thing you need to do is go into the folder and check Readme file and Install file if it is provided or go to the site and check documentations to see which commands you need, have you even got a compiler?
[positive]	[07:03]	<cool>	gooody, you can find more eye candy on gnome-look.org
[negative]	[07:03]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: It might not be automatically mounted, if that's the case - come back and we can walk through it
[neutral]	[07:03]	<seamus7>	gooody how would you like your icons to appear?
[neutral]	[07:03]	<Koheleth>	xfce programs hide behind the tool bar, anyway to make it rest at the top of the tool bar like in a mac
[negative]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	cpudan80: alright thanks. I'll reboot now.
[neutral]	[07:04]	<gooody>	seamus7: just like pdf licons like in windows
[neutral]	[07:04]	<sam__>	when i right click on my panel i dont get those options
[positive]	[07:04]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: in windows you wont be able to access d:\ as it is in linux partition m$ windows wont read it but ubuntu will read windows and other partitions
[negative]	[07:04]	<sam__>	is it because im using Xubuntu?
[negative]	[07:04]	<androver>	sam: yup, that's it.
[negative]	[07:04]	<Claan22>	baby_shambl3s: there's a readme, but it doesn't explain installation at all.  there's no install file.  I don't know if I have a compiler.  I'm following instructions here: @HLINK which I guess it the website
[positive]	[07:04]	<gooody>	seamus7: the default setting consumes a lot of space on my desktop
[positive]	[07:04]	<oddalot>	"w00t, i think it's compiling....IT""S ALIVE"
[negative]	[07:04]	<androver>	you'll have to do CPU scaling some other way.
[neutral]	[07:05]	<seamus7>	gooody you don't want the icons to preview their content ... you just want the pdf symbol to appear as the icon?
[positive]	[07:05]	<Daniel15>	"gooody, you just want normal icons to appear, and not the preview? Go to a folder and click Edit ->Preferences, change the ""Show thumbnails"" item on the Preview tab."
[neutral]	[07:05]	<gooody>	seamus7: yes
[negative]	[07:05]	<koomber1664>	um, how do I get my waste bin back on a panel?
[neutral]	[07:05]	<sam__>	damn xfce
[negative]	[07:05]	<seamus7>	gooody read what Daniel15 wrote
[neutral]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	koomber right click, add to panel
[negative]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	i had to restart once
[neutral]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	maybe it's a bug
[negative]	[07:06]	<Daniel15>	"Can anyone help with my problem? I just upgraded from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04 and keep getting ""You are not allowed to access the system configuration"" when I try to go to items in System -> Administration (eg. Networking)"
[neutral]	[07:06]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 did you Unlock the window?
[negative]	[07:06]	<androver>	sam: what kind of CPU do you have?
[negative]	[07:06]	<DON^SRK>	Hi Alls...Pls tell me how can i use paltalk on ubuntu ?
[positive]	[07:07]	<gooody>	thanks guys. it works.
[negative]	[07:07]	<Daniel15>	seamus7, what do you mean? I just click that option in the menu and that error pops up. The network config doesn't even load.
[neutral]	[07:07]	<sam__>	Intel Celeron (its probably 4 years old or so)
[neutral]	[07:07]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 are you set up as the administrator ... your username that is?
[negative]	[07:07]	<sam__>	HP Computer (if thats what u wanted to know)
[positive]	[07:08]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: its quite straight forward i think first two commands as I believe you did get the latest stable drive for you oyu cna even use command locate i.e. locate /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211
[negative]	[07:08]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211
[neutral]	[07:08]	<Daniel15>	Yeah, it worked fine in Ubuntu 7.10, but hasn't worked since I updated to 8.04
[negative]	[07:08]	<androver>	"ok, 2 suggestions.  first, apt-get install cpudyn.  if that doesn't help, apt-get install cpufreqd and google ""cpufreqd"" to configure it."
[neutral]	[07:08]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 look in UsersandGroups and see what privileges your username has?
[negative]	[07:09]	<oddalot>	awww man still didn't work
[negative]	[07:09]	<MrRoboto>	how can I save my external drive, it is not being recognized by ubuntu!!!! ??
[negative]	[07:09]	<Daniel15>	seamus7, I can't access that, same error :S
[negative]	[07:09]	<seamus7>	Daniel15 do you have another username you can login as?
[positive]	[07:09]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: its quite straight forward i think first two commands as I believe you did get the latest stable drive for you if you follow that it should work easily
[negative]	[07:09]	<Daniel15>	seamus7, I'll try to run it from a terminal and see if there's any output
[negative]	[07:09]	<Daniel15>	Nope, no other users

[negative]	[07:10]	<Starnestommy>	DON^SRK: I'm not sure if it's possible

[neutral]	[08:58]	<bvk>	hi, is there a way to install .debs into $HOME of non-root users ?
[negative]	[08:58]	<androver>	MrRoboto: it depends on what kind of errors you're getting.  it works if your hard drive is clicking.  paste some dmesg output into a pastebin and i'll look at it.
[negative]	[08:58]	<joe_>	merlin_: then read the last error code when you do the sudo sh nvidia*
[neutral]	[08:58]	<Taejo>	androver, now I've got @HLINK
[negative]	[08:58]	<joe_>	merlin_: it will tell you how to tell it where the file is, there is some syntax I forget

[positive]	[09:06]	<Dr_willis>	IndyGunFreak,  perhaps NOW the  thing will get bugs and security issues fixed. :)
[neutral]	[09:06]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: lemme try that

[negative]	[09:07]	<ubotu>	nick_: gnome is a project that provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for end-users, users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.
[neutral]	[09:07]	<martin_>	First, it does not appear the Upgrade menu
[neutral]	[09:07]	<nick_>	so what are andrake and all taht
[neutral]	[09:07]	<newscane>	ubuntu is installed on an IDE drive, attached to an IDE controller

[positive]	[09:08]	<Dr_willis>	nick_,  the desktop is easyally changed. Some disrtos default to gnome, some default to kde, others default to.. well others..
[neutral]	[09:08]	<newscane>	new drive is a 500 gig sata, attached to a sata controller, which i know linux has recognized (showed up in lspci)
[neutral]	[09:08]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: nvidia-cg-toolkit?
[negative]	[09:08]	<martin_>	But it was useless
[negative]	[09:08]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	toplok: info on that error would help
[negative]	[09:08]	<ferris_>	toplok, i don't know how to do that, but I am sure others will send it to you...
[positive]	[09:08]	<jintxo>	"Hello there. Was woindering if somebody knew a way of making ubuntu (8.04) not use compiz and just use metacity. I have ""No desktop effects"" selected but it's still running compiz and gtk-window-decorator. cheers :-)"
[positive]	[09:08]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  nope. thats not it. :) i did need that tool for somthing.. but thats not the nvidia-xconfig tool
[neutral]	[09:08]	<nick_>	d_wills: don;t understand o well
[neutral]	[09:08]	<toplok>	please pastebin /boot/grub/menu.lst, thanks
[positive]	[09:08]	<newscane>	now, it goes through bios, shows the first controller, the drive, second controller, the drive, splash screen again, and then i get a blinking cursor.
[neutral]	[09:09]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: nvidia-xconfig is what I need?
[neutral]	[09:09]	<orudie_>	this ubuntu channel keeps getting bigger and bigger
[positive]	[09:09]	<Dr_willis>	nvidia-settings - Tool of configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver AND nvidia-xconfig - The NVIDIA X Configuration Tool

[negative]	[09:09]	<newscane>	i disconnected the SATA drive, and booted with no problem.  any ideas?
[negative]	[09:09]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: its asking to remove the glx-new
[negative]	[09:09]	<razel>	i just installed hardy but my wireless lan wont work...

[neutral]	[09:10]	<simplexio>	newscane: did it work before ?
[negative]	[09:10]	<toplok>	ubuntung-pinoy, first my grub menu.lst was not properly updated so now I don't have access to the new kernel
[negative]	[09:10]	<orudie>	newscane, maybe your computer is trying to bood from the 500 gig
[negative]	[09:10]	<toplok>	the desktop effects are gone
[negative]	[09:10]	<razel>	anyone who knows more about wireless?? :(
[neutral]	[09:10]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  i dont knwo about that. I installed all 3 at the exact same time.  and this was a few weeks ago.
[neutral]	[09:10]	<newscane>	i looked at the bios... the IDE controller card is set to boot before the sata card
[negative]	[09:10]	<PolitikerNEU>	hi all, I got the following problem: My CPU is overheating and even maximum throttling (powersave - 2x1000 instead of 2x1667 Mhz and 75% throtteling so the CPU has effective 2x250 MhZ) doesn't help
[negative]	[09:10]	<martin_>	ubuntung-pinoy: In fact, nothing happens when I enter the command in terminal to upgrade from the CD
[negative]	[09:10]	<simplexio>	newscane: i thibk that you have wrong boot order
[negative]	[09:11]	<androver>	razel, i might...what's the problem?
[negative]	[09:11]	<martin_>	Just nothing
[neutral]	[09:11]	<ferris_>	toplok, @HLINK
[negative]	[09:11]	<orudie>	newscane, that doesnt work sometimes i had the same problem before
[positive]	[09:11]	<newscane>	so how do i fix it? :)

[neutral]	[09:11]	<ferris_>	toplok, np
[positive]	[09:11]	<razel>	androver: i bought a new laptop with vista pre installed and i dont want vista i like ubuntu and then i installed hardy and now fixing problems
[negative]	[09:11]	<newscane>	everything seems to be correct
[positive]	[09:12]	<guest59>	Hello,I installed the new xubuntu 8.04 on an old machine. Everything works well, except shutdown doesn't work: The computer doesn't turn off completely, it always hangs when the progress bar is down.
[neutral]	[09:12]	<newscane>	overall boot order is cd > removable media > hd > network
[negative]	[09:12]	<androver>	razel: ok, that makes sense, what's wrong with the wireless?  does it show up under ifconfig?
[neutral]	[09:12]	<newscane>	within HD, it's add-on cards > IDE > sata
[neutral]	[09:12]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: Ok, I have all three installed, and when I run nvidia-xconfig all it gives me is a corepointer error for the keyboard and mouse
[negative]	[09:12]	<orudie>	newscane, i'm not too sure, but there is a chance you should configure grub boot loader
[negative]	[09:12]	<simplexio>	newscane: where did you but that grub
[neutral]	[09:12]	<newscane>	grub is on the IDE drive
[positive]	[09:13]	<newscane>	it boots fine when i unplug the sata drive
[neutral]	[09:13]	<ditya>	l,l,l,l,;,
[negative]	[09:13]	<simplexio>	newscane: then it should be first
[neutral]	[09:13]	<jhaarman>	how to check which version a package is (apt commandline)
[positive]	[09:13]	<ferris_>	toplok, this is from a dual boot system so be sure to edit what you don't need out of it

[negative]	[09:13]	<simplexio>	newscane: do you have anything linux related stuff on sata ?
[neutral]	[09:13]	<newscane>	it is before the sata card...
[negative]	[09:13]	<razel>	androver: i typed ifconfig and what should i look?
[negative]	[09:14]	<newscane>	sata is a brand new drive, fresh out of the box

[negative]	[09:14]	<Tidus>	sorry about that guys... had to refresh my nick list and forgot to part most of my channels
[negative]	[09:14]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,   I dident have that issue. if you just installed the nvidia-glx drivers. You 'should' be able to restart the X server and it 'should' see the nvidia card and start using it. You MIGHT have to enable it in the restricted-managers tool
[negative]	[09:14]	<newscane>	only one sata drive on the sata card

[neutral]	[09:14]	<simplexio>	newscane: it worked when you used livecd ?
[positive]	[09:14]	<toplok>	ferris_, yep, I use five different OS here :)
[neutral]	[09:14]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: lemme restartx and try that, brb
[negative]	[09:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	I wanna see some install horror stories..lol, maybe we need a channel devoted to that
[neutral]	[09:15]	<newscane>	i put the xubuntu cd in, said boot from HD, and with the sata drive plugged in, i get a blinking cursor
[negative]	[09:15]	<hangthedj>	I just upgraded to 8.04, does this mean I have to run firefox 3, cause i don't want to.
[neutral]	[09:15]	<icesword>	jhaarman, @HLINK

[neutral]	[09:15]	<jhaarman>	icesword: thx.
[positive]	[09:15]	<toplok>	going to see if I can boot with the new kernel...
[neutral]	[09:15]	<androver>	guest59: sudo poweroff
[positive]	[09:15]	<hangthedj>	when i uninstall it, it uninstalls ubuntu-desktop and firefox, reinstalling these two automatically installs firefox-3
[negative]	[09:15]	<orudie>	newscane, are you getting any errors ? what is exactly happening when you connect your new sata drive ?
[positive]	[09:15]	<newscane>	with the sata drive in, this is what i get as i boot:
[negative]	[09:15]	<IndyGunFreak>	hangthedj: it doesn't remove ubuntu desktop.. thats just a meta-ackage
[neutral]	[09:15]	<simplexio>	newscane: does it boot from livecd ?
[neutral]	[09:15]	<astro76>	hangthedj: you can apt-get install firefox-2
[positive]	[09:16]	<icesword>	don't know ubuntu has it
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	hey
[negative]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	can someone please help me?
[negative]	[09:16]	<jhaarman>	I am using libpam-encfs and it seems to be failing after upgrade to 0804. More people have experience with that??
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	I've killed my grub boot loader
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	I'm currently on the Live CD
[negative]	[09:16]	<simplexio>	newscane: if it boots from livecd and sata work under it, you have messed grub or kernel
[negative]	[09:16]	<IndyGunFreak>	not very smart.
[neutral]	[09:16]	<androver>	ubuntu: so reinstall it?
[negative]	[09:16]	<razel>	androver: i did whats next?
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	how would I reinstall it?
[negative]	[09:16]	<androver>	razel: gimme the url for the paste
[neutral]	[09:16]	<jhaarman>	ubuntu_ on wiki is info on that
[negative]	[09:16]	<hangthedj>	it says firefox-2 is already the newest version, and if i run firefox-2 it loads firefox-3 beta 5
[neutral]	[09:16]	<ubuntu_>	would sudo apt-get install grub --reinstall work?
[negative]	[09:17]	<ferris_>	IndyGunFreak, my install was horrible.... well, the install on two machines were flawless on 8.04, but the configuring the wireless took me about 20 minutes, after I pulled my head out of a dark place.... on the old pc, no problems at all.
[positive]	[09:17]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  i had that issue for a while also.. then it fixed itself..
[neutral]	[09:17]	<razel>	androver: im using a wired internet right now...
[negative]	[09:17]	<rothchild>	I've got a borked install of msttcorefonts that I can't seem to get rid of or fix can anyone help?
[negative]	[09:17]	<hangthedj>	Dr_willis,  how did it fix itself?
[negative]	[09:17]	<newscane>	orudie: i get the gateway splash, then it recognizes the IDE card and the IDE drive, then the sata card and the sata drive, then a blinking cursor.  it also made some drive noises (sounded like the floppy and the ZIP drive going).  no error msg
[negative]	[09:17]	<IndyGunFreak>	ferris_: hmm, mine was fairly smooth on my PC and Laptop.... i set my wireless up the same way I did in gutsy(with a madwifi patch because my device gets misdetected).
[negative]	[09:17]	<androver>	razel: i need you to tell me the URL that the pastebin gave you for what you pasted
[negative]	[09:17]	<guest59>	Androver: I'll try. Please wait a moment.
[positive]	[09:17]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  it just started working. :) its working now for me here..
[negative]	[09:18]	<IndyGunFreak>	actually, i don't think i had any problems on either machine..lol
[positive]	[09:18]	<hangthedj>	ok, i'll wait it out :p, thanks.
[negative]	[09:18]	<orudie>	newscane, and then what?
[negative]	[09:18]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: No dice, it started back with nv drivers
[neutral]	[09:18]	<hangthedj>	haha
[neutral]	[09:18]	<tcpdumpgod>	XMMS1 isnt in Hardy?
[positive]	[09:18]	<Dr_willis>	hangthedj,  just ran  firefox-2   and its running the older firefox.

[positive]	[09:18]	<newscane>	"simplexio -- i have not tried to boot right off the cd, with the sata drive plugged in.  booting w/ the CD in, and then choosing ""boot from hard drive"" gives the blinking cursor"
[neutral]	[09:18]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  check the restricted-manager tool, be sure you have 'use nvidia' checked.
[neutral]	[09:18]	<razel>	androver: @HLINK
[positive]	[09:18]	<hangthedj>	Dr_willis, it looks like it just fixed itself ;)

[neutral]	[09:18]	<simplexio>	newscane: try it.. connect sata and boot from livecd
[positive]	[09:19]	<Dr_willis>	nick_,  you will have to try it and decide for yourself I guess. :)
[negative]	[09:19]	<hardy-wtf>	this live cd is making my lcd monitor black out like every three seconds what do i do about it?
[neutral]	[09:19]	<newscane>	brb.. lemme try
[neutral]	[09:19]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: System > Hardware drivers?
[negative]	[09:19]	<androver>	razel: ok, so the wireless card isn't showing up under ifconfig.  what kind of computer do you have?  make and model?
[negative]	[09:19]	<hangthedj>	running firefox-2 runs firefox-3, but if you launch it from the internet menu it runs firefox-2
[negative]	[09:19]	<nick_>	dr_wills: ok only been on 7 for about 2 days
[negative]	[09:19]	<IndyGunFreak>	i don't like Firefox's new download manager.. the old one was better(when doing multiple downloads)
[neutral]	[09:19]	<joe_>	Dr_willis: I used to have restricted drivers as an option, but its gone now
[negative]	[09:19]	<rothchild>	I think it's because I had privoxy installed but I don't any more
[negative]	[09:19]	<Dr_willis>	joe_,  no idea. Im not using gnome.. and i dont have the menus memorized
[negative]	[09:19]	<monkeybritches>	hardy-wtf: Is it the screensaver?

[negative]	[09:20]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	anyone know what to make of this? audio/x-asf-unknown decoder plugin
[negative]	[09:20]	<orudie>	newscane, my guess is that you have to try and get the grub configured for this new hard drive and for your system hard drive
[neutral]	[09:20]	<acidicbase>	anyone have a detailed changelog for 8.0.4 release?
[neutral]	[09:21]	<hardy-wtf>	no it is not the screensaver

[positive]	[09:44]	<negge>	IndyGunFreak of course it's what everyone should be using when everyone has a 64-bit processor

[positive]	[09:46]	<eeboy>	Cool... I see it under /mount. Gotta get used to everything appearing as files. Terminal highlights some of them in different colors and backgrounds. Is there a listing of the meanings somewhere?

[negative]	[10:22]	<blame>	vistakiller: I did, it fixed the turn off problem but it disabled the installed driver
[negative]	[10:22]	<oddalot>	lartza_ so why don't you write a java program...i was assuming you know java if you are dealing with jar files
[negative]	[10:22]	<blame>	Steve14_ub: I did, but to no avail.

[positive]	[10:24]	<Jagged|>	chivaknievel: nah it's about releasing that no ones listen to you and desiding to fix it yourself :P
[negative]	[10:24]	<MttJocy>	RudyValencia, I believe that the difference between /dev/hdx and /dev/sdx drives is how they are physically connected to the system (and therefore how they are seen from the kernel's perspective) however I could be wrong and I'm not sure which one refers to what maybe someone else could confirm that (and perhaps explain better than I can)
[negative]	[10:24]	<timandtom>	rothchild: :( No luck. And I made sure to leave it on when I restarted
[negative]	[10:25]	<RudyValencia>	OK
[positive]	[10:25]	<ditoa>	just because everything i have is divx/xvid :)
[negative]	[10:25]	<lartza_>	oddalot:Yea it would be pretty simple. It should search all .jar ended files and position the filename after href= correctly, but I'll do it hand

[negative]	[10:26]	<Dr_willis>	MttJocy,  that used to be how it worked. but now the changes in the kernel make most/all ide drives also show up as sd devices.
[neutral]	[10:26]	<chivaknievel>	from ubuntu
[negative]	[10:26]	<lartza_>	odda lot: I knew that and wondered why you started to talk about java, but there are only like 50 files left after all crap deleted
[negative]	[10:26]	<MttJocy>	Dr_willis, Oh right, didn't know that.
[negative]	[10:26]	<vistakiller>	chivaknievel wait then for updates
[negative]	[10:26]	<chivaknievel>	i guess thats a good plan
[neutral]	[10:26]	<Dr_willis>	MttJocy,  its due to cleanup of the ide and drive subsystem code from what ive read.

[positive]	[10:27]	<ubotu>	RudyValencia: Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See @HLINK - Remember, !repositories meant for Debian should NOT be used on Ubuntu!
[negative]	[10:28]	<chivaknievel>	but all of these problems are the sort of thing that will make it fail

[negative]	[10:29]	<MttJocy>	You know, I wonder why, especially when there is a new distribution update that puts a lot of pressure on the update servers (or it seams to be, my computers online update tool is downloading them now) have they ever considered making it so that the online distribution upgrade tool has the option to fetch the distribution update via torrent rather than hitting the update servers directly, I am sure given the option quite a few users would choose it and
[negative]	[10:29]	<MttJocy>	it could help reduce the peak load the update servers get on release day, or is there some reason this is technically not possible?

[negative]	[10:31]	<lartza_>	is there anyway to run hone jar progs on ubuntu?
[neutral]	[10:31]	<xipi>	astro76: so all ips from 192.168.0.0 - .255?
[negative]	[10:31]	<astro76>	xipi: so that's specifiying a network from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255 with a netmask I mentioned

[positive]	[10:32]	<oddalot>	24 is a number of bits?
[neutral]	[10:32]	<chivaknievel>	ubuntu will forget all your old settings because its really awesome like that and doesnt care about things like that

[negative]	[10:32]	<Trewas>	according to bug 208666 there should be fixed audacious in hardy-proposed, but unless I am looking at wrong places hardy-proposed is currently empty... so is it available somewhere?

[neutral]	[10:34]	<Ubuntu-Noob>	im on 7.10 at the mo
[neutral]	[10:34]	<astro76>	Ubuntu-Noob: it should work fine, but as always backup your files if they are important
[neutral]	[10:34]	<linux__alien>	i installed Ubuntu 8.04 everything works expect the NVIDIA driver. when i installed the Nvidia driver i just get a white screen. I use a NVIDIA Ge-Force 8400 M GS Card in my Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop
[negative]	[10:34]	<linux__alien>	is there a wor around for this?
[negative]	[10:35]	<MttJocy>	timandtom, Regards your wireless card no longer being detected after the distribution upgrade, perhaps you should submit a bug report with the details of your card etc, check nobody else has already posted one though.
[negative]	[10:35]	<lartza_>	could someone write me script to delete all files under 35kt from a folder?
[positive]	[10:35]	<timandtom>	amerio: I've been asking in here for a while too, no one seems to have any idea :( I'm thinking about just going back to 7.10 for a bit, especially if it turns out to be  Ubuntu specifically, not just the card not working at all(Haven't tried on XP yet)
[positive]	[10:35]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, i have the same card, only the non-mobile version, and the restricted drivers manager should handle them fine
[neutral]	[10:35]	<astro76>	lartza_: that should be one find command
[positive]	[10:35]	<astro76>	lartza_: well, find piped to xargs
[negative]	[10:35]	<elmargol>	Someone knows how I can see if an application uses XV?
[neutral]	[10:35]	<Exteris>	but linux__alien you should pastebin the contents of: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[negative]	[10:35]	<timandtom>	MttJocy: Thanks, already did though. But, that doesn't help me get it working NOW :(
[negative]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i just get a white screen ok  i ll do that i ll enable that driver and then paste the contents of pastebin
[negative]	[10:36]	<amerio>	timandtom: I had that problem in gutsy and spent like a week to fix it , i dont want to suffer again
[neutral]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, currently i am using X without xorg.conf i ve delete the file
[negative]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, is it possible to paste it now ? or should i enable it again and paste it?
[negative]	[10:36]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, you should have renamed it
[positive]	[10:36]	<timandtom>	Well, I'm out for the night. I'll try again tomorrow if it works in WinXP... Or just reinstall 7.10 if not. Farewell.
[neutral]	[10:36]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, uhm no you need the log with the errors in it
[positive]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i still have a backup though
[negative]	[10:37]	<lartza_>	astro76: Kinda amateur and didn't find script from google.
[positive]	[10:37]	<timandtom>	amerio: Ah, that sucks. Everything worked perfectly right out of the box for me with 7.10. It was really a great way to get introduced to Linux.
[neutral]	[10:37]	<eeboy>	Dr_willis, when a user logs in is what I am after
[negative]	[10:37]	<chivaknievel>	this is such a mess, if upgrading is going to cause so many problems to so many people, what is the point of the every 6 month upgrade?
[negative]	[10:37]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, so should i rename the file and again try logging into X and then copy the xorg.log and paste it?
[negative]	[10:37]	<MttJocy>	timandtom, To be honest not sure how to help you there, presumably something in the upgrade has broken the support for that card I guess, maybe someone else who has your card who is cleverer than me might figure out a workaround till it is fixed with some luck (either that or it gets fixed soon)
[negative]	[10:37]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, restore the backup, restart the xserver, it fails, then copy the log to another file and paste it
[positive]	[10:37]	<linux__alien>	done will do it now

[negative]	[10:43]	<tcpdumpgod>	bigtimer121, did you use the .bin file provided by nvidia.com or did you install it through APT?
[neutral]	[10:43]	<bigtimer121>	APT
[neutral]	[10:43]	<tcpdumpgod>	alienseer23-eee it probably screwed your xorg.conf up.
[negative]	[10:43]	<emorris>	if I want to upgrade from gutsy to hardy using a cd, do I need a desktop or alternate cd?
[neutral]	[10:44]	<tcpdumpgod>	desktop emorris
[positive]	[10:44]	<emorris>	ï»¿tcpdumpgod: thanks
[negative]	[10:44]	<howlingmadhowie>	lartza_: the easiest way would be to install  a mobile phone emulator
[neutral]	[10:44]	<tcpdumpgod>	bigtimer121, you should be able to just uninstall all the nvidia packages installed VIA APT then.
[neutral]	[10:45]	<alienseer23-eee>	tcpdumpgod: suggestion?

[positive]	[12:23]	<koudelka>	linux__alien, try and uninstall the nvidia driver and reinstall it, alternatively you can use envyng to install the latest nvidia driver
[negative]	[12:23]	<silentlamb>	ok
[negative]	[12:23]	<crashanddie>	joemac, at what point does it stop working, does it still boot (electrically), do you get to Grub, maybe even a splash screen ?
[positive]	[12:23]	<errpast>	silentlamb, about 2 years. It's great, but the hardware stuff can be very frustrating
[negative]	[12:23]	<linux__alien>	koudelka, did that too but no use

[negative]	[12:24]	<joemac>	tried /dev/hd1
[neutral]	[12:24]	<errpast>	silentlamb, it's come a huge way in three years
[negative]	[12:24]	<linux__alien>	koudelka, is it possible to get the 7.10 driver ?
[positive]	[12:24]	<brakkvatn>	Ceox: Does the device show on the NetworkManager in the top right corner?
[negative]	[12:24]	<zombie_monkey>	"so guys, I have ""PAND_ENABLED=1"" in /etc/default/bluetooth but there's only ""auto eth0"" in /etc/network/interfaces ... and runnign pand from the command line does absolutely nothing with any kind of parameter. but it does give me sugegstions for parameters and the man page is there :/"

[positive]	[12:45]	<Bits>	errpast: sound and graphics worked fine out of the box. networking took a bit of tweaking and advanced graphics took a bit of xorg tweaking. fan still needs to be tweaked and instability occurs with advanced desktop effects (something with the window titles)

[neutral]	[12:46]	<zeno>	lates
[negative]	[12:46]	<errpast>	Bits, I think my Lenovo 3000 needs a fan tweak, but my googling tells me maybe BIOS related.  I haven't dug in there yet.  It makes this louzy clicking sound. I thought maybe it was broken

[neutral]	[12:53]	<joneskoo>	oholiks: perhaps. I haven't did pinning so I'll just try the template first
[negative]	[12:53]	<samalex>	... the /home partition only has 5 gigs of free space but I've mounted a 300 gig HD within my home directory to backup stuff to.  OSX shows only 5 gigs free so when I try to copy stuff into this 300 gig mounted drive, says not enough space

[neutral]	[12:57]	<crashanddie>	dreamnid, firefox or firefox-3.0
[neutral]	[12:57]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Yeah, now if only their desktop upgrade tool would let you select torrent instead of HHTP
[neutral]	[12:57]	<MttJocy>	HTTP*

[neutral]	[12:58]	<daedra>	has anyone in here got mpd running in hardy?
[negative]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Oh?
[neutral]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, But they decided against it?
[negative]	[12:59]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, there are in fact a few problems with it
[neutral]	[12:59]	<g0th>	when I run make-kpkg binary-arch in linux-2.6.24/ I get at the end:
[negative]	[12:59]	<bumcheekcity>	hi guys. quick question. can you use wubi to install the x64 version of ubuntu on x86 Vista? obviously, I have a 64-bit capable CPU

[neutral]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Such as?
[negative]	[13:00]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, first of all, we would need to take a few choices, like do we make one big package with everything in it for the upgrade, or one .torrent per package ?
[neutral]	[13:00]	<daedra>	paste!|goth
[neutral]	[13:00]	<daedra>	oops
[negative]	[13:00]	<g0th>	hmm and I can't set the background anymore somehow
[neutral]	[13:00]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, both are good, because one is better for the server, but the other is better for maintainability
[neutral]	[13:00]	<daedra>	!paste|g0th
[neutral]	[13:00]	<ubotu>	g0th: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at @HLINK (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)

[negative]	[13:00]	<MajSh>	please anyone... i really need to get the TV OUT working.. it's the last thing that sends me back to windows.. :(
[positive]	[13:01]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, then of course, it would mean that the devs need to push yet another package, and pushing a release on bittorrent is way harder than just working behind the projectors and syncing HTTP/FTP mirrors
[neutral]	[13:01]	<g0th>	@HLINK
[negative]	[13:01]	<g0th>	ubotu: that's the whole output
[negative]	[13:01]	<g0th>	daedra sorry
[negative]	[13:02]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's cheaper, but it's harder, and we've seen it during the last couple days, even the tracker got downed by the amount of users
[neutral]	[13:02]	<Ceo1>	hey
[negative]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, imagine what it would be if everyone did the same ? Also, bittorrent doesn't allow you to use local mirrors, so those who don't care would be using one download for each computer, instead of setting up a local mirror and downloading it once
[neutral]	[13:03]	<Ceo1>	brakkvatn
[neutral]	[13:03]	<Ceo1>	r u there?
[negative]	[13:03]	<g0th>	how do I change my background image?
[neutral]	[13:03]	<joomla_user>	g0th, what are you building ?
[negative]	[13:03]	<m0ns00n>	Anyone knows why eclipse can't connect to the net in hardy?
[neutral]	[13:03]	<g0th>	linux-2.6.24
[neutral]	[13:03]	<joomla_user>	g0th, rightclick on desktop
[negative]	[13:03]	<g0th>	I don't know why xen is mentioned
[neutral]	[13:03]	<m0ns00n>	Not installed from packages..
[positive]	[13:03]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, One .torrent per package probably would not really be the best idea to be fair, torrent tends to not work as efficiently with many small files, however if you put it in one big torrent it would work better, and it is still possible to selectively download the .debs inside it (Azureus has the option I think all Bit Torrent clients do)
[negative]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's a nice idea, but it's pretty much flawed from the start, and we'd need to hack it big time before we could do something with it
[neutral]	[13:04]	<lamothe>	beardos: And there you are!
[negative]	[13:04]	<g0th>	joomla_user: hmm I don't get anything if I right click
[negative]	[13:04]	<g0th>	I don't have nautlius installed

[negative]	[13:04]	<g0th>	if I install nautilus my system gets so slow so since I never use it I removed it
[neutral]	[13:04]	<joomla_user>	g0th, what window manager do you use
[negative]	[13:04]	<zyx386>	why the forefox is standard work offline under Hardy?
[negative]	[13:04]	<crashanddie>	"MttJocy, yeah, but ""selectively downloading the .debs"" is pretty much counter productive, because you don't have it, and you don't share with others"

[neutral]	[13:06]	<joeamined>	how can i install ubuntu from the live cd without launching gnome ?
[neutral]	[13:06]	<silentlamb>	errpast so wat do u do wit ur linux box
[negative]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I think there's something else that worries them, we've all seen how updates get distributed on WoW, or any other update manager that uses bittorrent
[positive]	[13:06]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Talking about local mirrors, I wish that squid didn't decide not to cache .debs if it had cached them would save having to download them all again for the other machine :|
[negative]	[13:06]	<gfather>	guys anyone here has a vpn for god sake ?? ??
[neutral]	[13:06]	<Yapsey>	joeamined: there's an alternate install CD
[negative]	[13:06]	<silentlamb>	want to learn perl and python very important in security
[positive]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, like I said, it could be an awesome idea, but it really needs some work, I might write an essay about it or something ;)
[negative]	[13:07]	<joeamined>	yapsey: is it possible from the live cd ?
[negative]	[13:07]	<Yapsey>	don't know. maybe the second option in the booting menu?
[positive]	[13:07]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I have a local mirror on my home network, I've uploaded more than 80Gig on release day ;)

[negative]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	ssh-agent seems not to work
[negative]	[13:08]	<jdolan>	Yapsey, sure, how do i tell it to do that?
[negative]	[13:08]	<jdolan>	just remove the CD from my sources list?
[positive]	[13:08]	<b33r_>	does anyone know where's iced tea java cache directory and how to change it?
[negative]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	yeah how can install ubuntu on and empty system with a bad crcrive
[positive]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	always get an error
[negative]	[13:08]	<MttJocy>	(Unless there is some way to force it to cache them, but bit late now, already done the download on the one machine anyway, although if there was a way to force it would save wasted downloads when both computers have to download for the most part the same updates even with normal updates)
[positive]	[13:08]	<Yapsey>	jdolan: place a # in front of your CD is the easiest way I guess :)
[negative]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
[negative]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	is there any solution to that problem
[negative]	[13:08]	<zyx386>	can every one tell me that?
[neutral]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	seen the pendrive
[positive]	[13:09]	<jdolan>	Yapsey, hah, why didn't i think of that?  (just disabling the source), hehe :)
[positive]	[13:09]	<Yapsey>	you're welcome :>

[neutral]	[13:09]	<joneskoo>	no hardy
[negative]	[13:09]	<MttJocy>	Is that possible? to force squid to cache .debs instead of ignore them? (I assume the file names do change with each version of the package right)
[negative]	[13:09]	<zyx386>	why is FF Work offline standard?

[neutral]	[13:35]	<g0th>	lamothe: anyway, thx for the information
[neutral]	[13:35]	<g0th>	another question
[negative]	[13:35]	<reiki>	mluser-home, assuming your motherboard supports it... you probably want a 64-bit version of Ubuntu... not 32-bit
[neutral]	[13:35]	<mut80r>	mluser-home: you need a 64-bit machine and OS
[positive]	[13:35]	<Yapser>	running a 64-bit distro instead of 32 mluser-home? (just slap me enormously if this is a Windows-only prob :>)
[negative]	[13:35]	<g0th>	I tried to install my own custom kernel using make-kpkg
[positive]	[13:35]	<justin420>	mut80r: thanks allot! appreciate it.... saved me allot of headache. :)
[negative]	[13:35]	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: sure.. but these settings doesn't seem to help :(
[negative]	[13:35]	<mluser-home>	doesnt the kernel in pae mode detect 4G of ram even in 32 bit mode?
[positive]	[13:35]	<g0th>	the usual installation works fine (ie. doing make, make modules, etc in linux-2.6.24) but when I run make-kpkg it always fails, etg with the following message:

[neutral]	[13:35]	<moorkook>	hello everybody
[neutral]	[13:36]	<mut80r>	mluser-home: it may do, but it won't be able to address it all on a 32-bit machine/OS

[negative]	[13:37]	<dirtyrice>	jarle: why would you want to do that
[positive]	[13:37]	<mut80r>	mluser-home: there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions of almost all of the packages
[positive]	[13:37]	<mluser-home>	mut80r: Thanks
[negative]	[13:37]	<cherva>	please help when I apt-get glipper the install completes normally and after that there is no glipper installed
[positive]	[13:37]	<lamothe>	daniel_hh: If you haven't already, can I recommend logging out/in.  Maybe gconf is stuck.
[negative]	[13:37]	<mut80r>	mluser-home: as far as I know.
[negative]	[13:37]	<GoodJob>	my system has the keyboard layout set to some other than the USA... in the system the behaviour is correct, but in the Login Window the keyboard layout is messed up (the USA layout is loaded)... how can i make my system's keyboard layout to be the same for the Login Window?

[negative]	[13:38]	<idyllic>	silent: back up your xorg.conf first in case there is problem later

[negative]	[13:39]	<joeamined>	is it possible to install ubuntu desktop edition without launching gnome ?

[negative]	[13:39]	<g0th>	hmpf, not much help here :(

[negative]	[13:39]	<rsk>	nope
[negative]	[13:39]	<mut80r>	chazco: I don't exactly know what the sideways scrolling bar is there for. disabling the splash screen, all I see is a 10-second or so pause before it gets going.
[neutral]	[13:40]	<silent>	idyllic: i dont think so
[negative]	[13:40]	<theone_>	joeamined, do you mean booting straight to a command line?
[negative]	[13:40]	<joeamined>	theone: i mean installing ubuntu with command line
[negative]	[13:40]	<silent>	idyllic: just installed this ubuntu and put xchat on it, nothing else
[positive]	[13:40]	<chazco>	mut80r - Unsure what its for here also... on mine if i boot in recovery mode I see it pause over ACPI/SATA initalisation...
[negative]	[13:40]	<joeamined>	because i don't have enough RAM (only 256), so i can't install with live cd booted
[positive]	[13:41]	<idyllic>	silent: System - Administration - Hardware Driver =D enable the restrictive driver
[negative]	[13:41]	<dirtyrice>	then you must use alternate cd like the guy above said
[negative]	[13:41]	<mut80r>	chazco: are you using a SATA drive ?
[neutral]	[13:41]	<joeamined>	ok thanks
[neutral]	[13:41]	<chazco>	mut80r - Yep... but my desktop is also which doesnt have this issue
[negative]	[13:41]	<dirtyrice>	i had to use it when installing on a 550
[negative]	[13:41]	<theone_>	joeamined, you should just pick the install without booitng to the live cd option
[neutral]	[13:41]	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: I allread restarted X and the computer
[positive]	[13:41]	<mut80r>	chazco: would be best not to mess with anything for now then until someone can tell us what it's there for. ;)

[negative]	[14:02]	<MttJocy>	pawan, Go to System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers and make sure that is set to use the restricted driver not the open source one see if that helps (if it is not set select the restricted driver and reboot your computer see if that fixes it)
[neutral]	[14:03]	<spiniker>	where?
[neutral]	[14:03]	<theone_>	@HLINK

[positive]	[14:05]	<Dante123>	hi all, sometimes my pc running 7.10 hangs on boot.  I have disabled quiet boot and have written down where in the boot process it is when it hangs.  Generally, turning the machine off and back on fixes the problem.  I have had people suggest the psu but it is a 450w and personally I think it is working fine.  Someone suggested I write down the exact points at which it hangs.

[negative]	[14:08]	<MttJocy>	pawan, Okay, try uninstalling the proprietary driver, restart, see if that works, then try reinstalling the proprietary one again if you want to, perhaps in the upgrade your install of that got messed up or something.

[negative]	[14:25]	<magnetron>	Musashiden: there is another one around. but it's not done yet. the reason your flash videos are slow is that Adobe made a crappy flash player
[negative]	[14:25]	<bartmon>	ubuntung-pinoy: It hink you should disable desktop effects (compiz)
[neutral]	[14:25]	<LadyNikon>	magnetron: heh
[negative]	[14:25]	<lintel>	MttJocy: VLC is running fine. But Kaffeine crashes especially after another window covered it or when switching to another desktop.

[negative]	[14:26]	<Musashiden>	magnetron: when i first opened a flash site, firefox gave me a choice of 3 flash players to use. I chose adobe since I thought it would be better.

[positive]	[14:26]	<nads>	Hi guys - I have two HDDs, first is a SATA driver which has Windows on it, and the second is an IDE drive. I installled Ubuntu 8.04 on the IDE one, but I'm unable to boot into it... it always loads Windows first. Can anyone please guide me to the right direction? Thanks
[positive]	[14:26]	<duncan>	kaminix :no because you see theare is a block also 1024, so actualy 1024^3=GB :)
[neutral]	[14:26]	<nwillett>	it seems like hardy has changed the way you make vlc the default dvd player. Used to do change that through removable drives and media settings. Where do you go now?
[negative]	[14:26]	<Slappy>	makgyver i did a google search for initramfs error and there was a forum that mentioned what someone tried running HH with the pci=nomsi command

[negative]	[14:27]	<Musashiden>	nads: Did you configure your bios to read the IDE first?
[negative]	[14:27]	<magnetron>	Musashiden: the other one is called gnash. i don't think you'll be happy with it, sadly. when my youtube videos are slow, i download them manually and watch them locally.
[positive]	[14:27]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	nads: are u sure that boot priority in the BIOS is right?
[negative]	[14:27]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?

[positive]	[14:27]	<bartmon>	ubuntung-pinoy: Don't know much about it... But when i switched between two X sessions with both compiz enhanced, the new X session would freeze
[positive]	[14:27]	<duncan>	kaminix: welcome :)
[negative]	[14:27]	<Musashiden>	magnetron: so I'm guessing there is no fix as of yet for linux and flash video lags?

[negative]	[14:35]	<duncan>	Lieutenant: then maybe the download was wrong, i think, before you burn somethink to cd, you try it, for example, you can try this boot image in virtualbox
[negative]	[14:35]	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, I thought you meant set up port forwarding on your ubuntu computer (as you did ask in the ubuntu channel)

[neutral]	[14:35]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: check the md5sum of the iso.
[negative]	[14:36]	<johnmike>	MttJocy: ha ha, sorry! I asked here because maybe there's an Ubuntu specific site addressing it
[negative]	[14:36]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: even getting there takes about a minute, usually it logs in within a second
[negative]	[14:36]	<akt>	Hi. This must be a FAQ but I'm worndering what's the advantage/disadvantage of using ubuntu server instead of Debian?

[neutral]	[14:36]	<virus92ita>	anyone can help me with video card drivers?
[negative]	[14:36]	<mut80r>	johnmike: some routers won't activate port forwarding until you disable DHCP. annoying, I know.
[neutral]	[14:37]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: heh, so general connection issues, not specifically with ping... what actual type of connection to the internet does it have?
[positive]	[14:37]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: it passed the md5sum on my xp box
[negative]	[14:37]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable, about 15 mbit down, 1.5 mbit up. usually no problems at all
[positive]	[14:37]	<akt>	Both will provide latest apps and anyway both the same Linux kernel. using the same aptitude
[neutral]	[14:37]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: never mind the previous
[neutral]	[14:37]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: are there are boxen on the same connection you can check?
[negative]	[14:37]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: straight to modem, no router (anymore). possible that it was hacked somehow?
[negative]	[14:37]	<akt>	what's the difference?
[negative]	[14:38]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: nope
[neutral]	[14:38]	<akt>	As a server.

[negative]	[14:38]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: hmm well it's a bit difficult to say that's it definitively a problem with ubuntu
[neutral]	[14:38]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I can go overthere which I will do even though it's a bit of a hassle.. what should I check for first, behind the thing?
[negative]	[14:38]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: what's the Process Name u get ?
[negative]	[14:38]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[negative]	[14:39]	<mut80r>	johnmike: unless you know how to set a static IP and have the DNS addresses, DON'T disable DHCP.
[neutral]	[14:39]	<Jarwo>	sweety_girl
[negative]	[14:39]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: if you can go over there and access the box, then you can do a lot of general connection tests
[negative]	[14:39]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Yes, you should have ~350MB of Ram to do the ive cd.
[negative]	[14:39]	<Fritzel>	danbhfive, this is an interesting rts, from the first few minutes in the tutorial it seems like there isnt' much micro-management to worry about
[negative]	[14:39]	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: i dont know process name, thats the thing...
[negative]	[14:39]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: i just wanted to install it
[negative]	[14:39]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: the disk does work on my laptop, same specs, just a dell
[positive]	[14:40]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yeah, bit afraid they'll come out the same.. :-/ anything I should look at after concluding it's not connecting?
[negative]	[14:40]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ha ha, no. I would look it all up first. How would I learn how to setup static IPs, figure out DNSs, and all that on Ubuntu?
[neutral]	[14:40]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: You should download the text-based alternate cd from the ubuntu site.
[negative]	[14:40]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: me neither.. but no Process Name in the SysMon that resembles the one u're looking for?
[negative]	[14:40]	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, well if you wait here a few minutes I'll be happy to talk to you see if I can come up with any ideas to help y ideas to help you but I just need to restart this computer first so will be gone a few minutes ok?

[negative]	[14:40]	<ciro>	bebraw, i just installed awn and awn manager but there are no applets in the program
[positive]	[14:40]	<mut80r>	johnmike: are you using network-manager? (the network icon in the top right corner)
[negative]	[14:41]	<Daverocks>	"Nomikos_: well it seems unstable rather than ""not connecting""... i'd start up a packet sniffer on it and check what's going on..."
[negative]	[14:41]	<MttJocy>	Okay, see you in a few minutes.
[negative]	[14:41]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  PLEASE?
[negative]	[14:41]	<bebraw>	ciro, i suppose you have to get the plugins elsewhere
[negative]	[14:41]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah
[negative]	[14:41]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: yeah if it's ppp, check those logs
[negative]	[14:41]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: good idea, I'll try that
[neutral]	[14:41]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: ppp?
[negative]	[14:41]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: The RAM requirement are just what they say on the Ubuntu web site, and could very welll be the reason of your problem. i've gotten the live cd to run on a box with 128MB!!
[negative]	[14:41]	<magnetron>	ciro: you have to drag something to the icon area, IIRC
[neutral]	[14:41]	<mut80r>	johnmike: right click nm-applet, click connection information. copy down IP address, default route, subnet mask, and DNS addresses.
[negative]	[14:41]	<x0x>	ok how to install eBox?

[negative]	[14:42]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: point-to-point... thought it might be the way it's going through the modem
[positive]	[14:42]	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I just got Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver). I installed those drivers and a blinking icon told me to reboot my pc. Now I can't use ubuntu anymore, I always get a black screen before log on screen. Can someone help me?
[neutral]	[14:42]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable modem, broadband
[negative]	[14:42]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: is the cable modem itself a network device or is it bridged?

[neutral]	[14:44]	<khafra>	It has a very limited set of commands, and as far as I could tell the didn't include a text editor, and sed didn't work properly

[neutral]	[14:45]	<psych>	but when apt-get install
[negative]	[14:45]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: so you've got no special cable clients running on the ubuntu box, you just use plain dhcp?
[neutral]	[14:45]	<mut80r>	johnmike: after disabling DHCP you will no longer get any addresses from your network so you'd need to enter them manually into every machine on your network
[neutral]	[14:45]	<psych>	it asks for restart that Paavi2_0
[neutral]	[14:45]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yes.
[positive]	[14:45]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: wud u recommend using a filesystem other than EXT3? wud that hav repercussions on my beautifully running hardy?
[negative]	[14:45]	<psych>	it says 1 not fully installed or removed.

[negative]	[14:46]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I'll go there now and try to connect another machine, see if that has the same issues. will also check with wireshark to see if anything is off
[negative]	[14:46]	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: I would not reccomend running *nix on anything other than EXT2/3. both are unrecognisable to windows but you can get a program to open EXT3 filesystems.

[neutral]	[14:47]	<tj__>	yes
[negative]	[14:47]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ok! How do I make sure than my Ubuntu box is listening on the ports I need it to?
[negative]	[14:47]	<mut80r>	johnmike: that all depends on the program you're running that needs the ports forwarded.
[negative]	[14:47]	<tyler>	tj_: try manually editing xorg.conf
[neutral]	[14:47]	<tj__>	path?
[neutral]	[14:48]	<mut80r>	tj__: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[negative]	[14:48]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah. I'm just trying to set it up mainly for transmission, but someone had told me that I had to be careful when selecting a port for use because specific ports are reserved for specific things.
[negative]	[14:49]	<mut80r>	johnmike: select any port you want above 30000 as a safe rule. they can go up to 65535.

[positive]	[14:57]	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I just got Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver).

[negative]	[15:00]	<nibsa1242b>	minus198: you need to have the wireless turned on for the system to know its there... you probably don't have to reboot just press the key combo to turn the card on
[negative]	[15:00]	<josh04_>	gausus: Try burning the CD at a low speed
[negative]	[15:00]	<z0g>	gausus, this was questioned before... edit the CD out of the /etc/apt/sources.list by placing a # in front

[negative]	[15:09]	<minus198>	mut80r|brb: no.. the light indicates it to be off, but I have tried switching it back and forth.
[negative]	[15:09]	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: I think if I can figure out how it knows that it crashed and make it think it didn't crash that it'll work fine.
[negative]	[15:09]	<sCOTTo>	ok
[neutral]	[15:09]	<abhu>	Sleep Well

[positive]	[15:09]	<sCOTTo>	thanks :)
[negative]	[15:09]	<mut80r|brb>	minus198: I think this is the problem. try rebooting and turning the wireless off/on before the OS loads. the light should come on.
[neutral]	[15:09]	<humbolto>	how to fix the no root-on-loop problem?
[positive]	[15:09]	<z0g>	Quick ATi howto: Install the driver in Synaptic (do a search on fglrx and install the driver and the control panel), then System -> Administration -> Hardware Drivers, disable and enable the ATi driver.. the light should go from red to green now.
[negative]	[15:09]	<graingert>	oh

[negative]	[15:10]	<MirrorImage>	So, with Hardy Heron (or perhaps this is just the firefox beta) is the text odd on any websites?

[neutral]	[15:10]	<graingert>	linkmaster03: rightclick, open with
[negative]	[15:10]	<mut80r|brb>	MirrorImage: many people have complained about the text rendering. I just downgraded to firefox-2
[neutral]	[15:11]	<MttJocy>	nibsa1242b, So it is currently crashing as soon as it starts then, before you click on anything?
[negative]	[15:11]	<MirrorImage>	I don't know how to downgrade...
[neutral]	[15:11]	<MirrorImage>	Well, actually, I might. Last time it wouldn't let me for some weird reason.
[positive]	[15:11]	<linkmaster03>	graingert: I just want to set it so it will always open with a certain program when I double click it
[neutral]	[15:11]	<abhu>	Why Downgrade?
[neutral]	[15:11]	<MirrorImage>	the text is hard to read on the new beta for me.
[neutral]	[15:11]	<mut80r|brb>	MirrorImage: synaptic package manager. search for firefox. remove all completely. delete ~/.mozilla... reboot. sudo apt-get install firefox-2
[neutral]	[15:11]	<crashhandler>	where can i found default kde startup sound,somewhere on the net?
[negative]	[15:11]	<virus92ita>	z0g, seems interesting, but I first need to boot ubuntu from Hard Disk, not from live cd
[negative]	[15:11]	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: Its doing its Crash Detection Window, telling me that it crashed the last time it was running. And that window is useless.
[negative]	[15:11]	<pwm>	MttJocy netstat -a says nothing is listening on 177

[negative]	[15:12]	<Crusader_Tech>	Could someone help with an Ubuntu question? I just used Wubi to install Ubuntu on my laptop, and everything seems to work except my wirelss.  I found something that sounds like it might work on a web site, but it seems I need root access in a terminal window.
[neutral]	[15:12]	<bardyr>	When will the hardy+1 respo open?
[neutral]	[15:12]	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: Accessories -> Terminal. use sudo for admin commands
[neutral]	[15:12]	<nibsa1242b>	z0g: virus92ita yeah, restricted wirless drivers in a live CD situation are difficult to make work properly
[negative]	[15:12]	<bod_>	im still not geting sound because i seem to have 4 instances of my sound card 3 dont output sound and 1 gives an error -- audiotestsrc wave=sine freq=512 ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! gconfaudiosink: Could not open audio device for playback. -- can someone help plz
[neutral]	[15:13]	<virus92ita>	z0g I'm gonna format my partition and reinstall ubuntu, so I can find right drivers
[negative]	[15:13]	<MttJocy>	pwm, Okay, have you restarted your computer after you changed your configuration? (btw I have not really tried to set up remote gdm, so I'm just trying to think of possible causes off the top of my head, since nobody else seams to have any answers anyway).
[negative]	[15:13]	<Crusader_Tech>	mut80r|brb, the command doesn't work once I try that.  It's like sudo puts me in some kind of different directory

[positive]	[15:14]	<mut80r|brb>	Crusader_Tech: you have to put sudo before the command. not just sudo.   example:   sudo command
[negative]	[15:14]	<pwm>	MttJocy yeah i did the restart and just about everything else I could find on google so I must be missing something obvious
[negative]	[15:14]	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: I figured out that if I remove the .running file from the .evolution directory in my home folder it doesn't know that it crashed and starts up normally.
[negative]	[15:14]	<Beererde>	should i use glx or glx-new ???
[neutral]	[15:14]	<vistakiller>	Beererde use envyng
[negative]	[15:14]	<humbolto>	"Does anybody else have the ""no root-on-loop"" probleem?"
[positive]	[15:14]	<vistakiller>	you will find it in synaptic
[neutral]	[15:14]	<minus198>	mut80r|brb: Hm.. this is really weird. The light won't change... I'll try to boot the liveCD and see if it works better.

[positive]	[15:21]	<ifireball>	dmsuperman_: you can do that, but its a less modular approach, the default /etc/crontab file may also be overwritten by a future upgrade
[neutral]	[15:21]	<mut80r>	KalEl: windows and ubuntu are seperate.

[positive]	[15:36]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: awesome. I got so sick of windows about a month ago that i finally just sat down and came up with a list of apps that I absolutely need, and found alternatives. Then I installed Ubuntu, and the only time I boot XP now is for games and photoshop :D
[neutral]	[15:36]	<graingert>	Dante123: now add it to your menu.list in grub
[negative]	[15:36]	<Dante123>	so graingert, what else might be the problem?
[negative]	[15:36]	<mikebot>	Oh, I have another question: My tracker hasn't been indexing--when I try to re-index, it disappears from the panel, and I have to re-open it with like `tracker-applet' (in which case there is then two in the panel), and it still hasn't indexed anything... ANyone know why this is happening?
[negative]	[15:36]	<graingert>	Dante123: there is no problme
[negative]	[15:36]	<giggsey>	Is there a way to get rid of that audiopulse crap? It crashes on login for me
[neutral]	[15:36]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: for photoshop and games, use ReactOS. I have a dualboot on here with that and this (hardy).
[negative]	[15:37]	<Dante123>	ï»¿graingert so you mean add it at the end in the menu.lst too right?
[neutral]	[15:37]	<pwm>	ifireball: right host says ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
[neutral]	[15:37]	<mstevens>	hi, I upgraded to hardy heron and now I don't get a login box anymore

[negative]	[15:37]	<pwm>	ifireball: could it be an ipv6 problem?
[positive]	[15:37]	<graingert>	Dante123: debian has a special way of playing things with grub
[positive]	[15:37]	<MttJocy>	bagelong, Possibly not the best channel to ask about windows issues to be fair although maybe some people here might have some pointers for you I guess.
[negative]	[15:37]	<Dante123>	okay, well I am still a skeptic because the original boot prob is sporadic anyway.  Sometimes it boots fine on first try.  But I will do as you say and see if the hangs are done.
[negative]	[15:37]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: I haven't ever heard of that, what is it?
[negative]	[15:37]	<nethakz>	anyone know why the network manager doesn't do wpa? I do have wpa-supplicant installed. this is for hardy...

[negative]	[15:38]	<_paradox_>	can anyone just give me a time estimate of about when update manager will notify me of hardy?
[neutral]	[15:38]	<MttJocy>	pwm, You are using IPv6 on your network then?
[negative]	[15:38]	<krasher>	ï»¿i'm having problems with ubuntu hardy heron, a LG Studioworks 55i and a Nvidia Geforce FX-5200... when i install the nvidia-glx-new driver and do a reboot, my computer starts in failsafe mode... i can't switch to 1024x768 at 60hz, my optimal resolution that i use in windows and at ubuntu 7.10, in which i had several problems until putting it to work properly
[negative]	[15:38]	<un2him>	Dante123: let me know if it works
[negative]	[15:38]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: How is compatability? I mean I don't play very many games, but the ones I do play are pretty complex
[positive]	[15:38]	<Dante123>	thanks...worked!  ï»¿un2him  :-D
[neutral]	[15:38]	<Stomp442>	Paradox...hardy's out...should be in your update manager
[negative]	[15:38]	<PriceChild>	I remember places saying that ubuntu included an easy gui firewall by default, where is it?
[negative]	[15:38]	<bazhang>	albech some folks are experiencing difficulties when upgrading from gutsy to hardy with that card; I did as well--oddly enough a fresh install of hardy does not have that issue--the launchpad page may have some workaround by now if you wish to check
[positive]	[15:39]	<un2him>	Dante123: very cool, i'm glad!
[neutral]	[15:39]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: it has full binary compatibility with drivers and apps. directx and openGL work too on the games I use (unreal tournament, halo, etc)
[positive]	[15:39]	<Dante123>	thanks un2him.  Have a good day
[negative]	[15:39]	<MttJocy>	bagelong, Ah, sorry my apologies, I have only just upgraded to Hardy myself and hadn't noticed that particular utility.
[neutral]	[15:39]	<nethakz>	PriceChild, it not gui, it's command line only
[negative]	[15:39]	<pwm>	MttJocy I have no idea? both client and server are running ubuntu desktop 7.something
[negative]	[15:39]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: takes a few hundred megs of hdd space. boots up in ~ 30 seconds.
[positive]	[15:39]	<albech>	bazhang: guess ill backup my stuff and do a fresh install.. thanks

[neutral]	[15:39]	<graingert>	Dante123: check the private message

[neutral]	[15:39]	<PriceChild>	bazhang: yes
[positive]	[15:39]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: awesome, I'll check that out :D
[neutral]	[15:40]	<pwm>	MttJocy ifconfig says somehting about ipv6
[positive]	[15:40]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: you can DL it as an ISO or a virtual machine (VMware, VirtualPC) I believe.
[negative]	[15:40]	<MttJocy>	pwm, But in netstat it is not bound to any IPv4 addresses?
[positive]	[15:40]	<bazhang>	albech best to try the livecd and verify what I said--it worked for me, but worksforme may not for you
[negative]	[15:40]	<weary>	ubuntu boots up but i get 'ALERT /dev/sda1<garbled> does not exist. Dropping to a shell'. where does the garbage after the devicename come from?
[negative]	[15:40]	<un2him>	Dante123: no prob...you too
[negative]	[15:40]	<pwm>	I can ping both host and server from each other - X -query localhost :1 does not work either
[negative]	[15:40]	<dmsuperman_>	mut80r: yeah but VM's don't support 3d rendering fast enough for games so there'd be no point in a VM
[positive]	[15:40]	<mut80r>	dmsuperman_: just to see what it's like :P
[neutral]	[15:40]	<pwm>	MttJocy correct netstat doesn't have any ipv4 port 177 application listed

[negative]	[15:49]	<gmenelau>	bazhang what is kde3 or kde 4 ?
[negative]	[15:49]	<josh04_>	bagelong: Apparently we need to add something to /etc/rc.local
[neutral]	[15:49]	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: That's what I thought, but it always outputs bz2 files. Even a simple command, compressing a single file like that makes it 0 bytes

[positive]	[15:51]	<josh04_>	bagelong: How odd. Can you remove them both with ndiswrapper -r?
[negative]	[15:51]	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: That works. I am running this to backup 5GB worth of data though, so would it be a whole lot slower to archive and then compress as you suggested?
[negative]	[15:51]	<eternal_p>	vicky123_: you will be better served, if you are new to ubuntu to use the x86 rather than 64-bit
[negative]	[15:51]	<tseug>	mut80r, same thing 'No such file or directory'
[positive]	[15:51]	<bazhang>	vicky123_: depends on you; both will support dual core

[negative]	[15:51]	<ghostknife>	dmsuperman_: well, it would have to do it in 2 steps instead of one

[negative]	[16:11]	<ssam>	yowshi, if you have installed lots of third party stuff, or had to do lots of tweaks to make things work, then there is a higher chance of the upgrade breaking

[neutral]	[16:16]	<amenado>	tseug-> first it has to be mounted,
[positive]	[16:16]	<mut80r>	N1NCHN41L5: it can be done. run the PCLinuxOS installer and it should detect you have GRUB already and add itself to the boot menu.
[neutral]	[16:16]	<eternal_p>	N1NCHN41LS: @HLINK  (first result)
[positive]	[16:16]	<ssam>	N1NCHN41L5, most linux installers do a pretty good job of finding other linux distros and making a GRUB list to boot all of them

[neutral]	[16:28]	<simmerz>	I'm now using hardy
[negative]	[16:28]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: k.  that's the extent of my intelligent advice, alas.  but it might pay to read the grub man page.  perhaps you can manually install the boot sector on the external drive, if it's missing.  I assume the drive isn't coming up at all and you're not even getting grub.
[negative]	[16:29]	<red_>	mut80r i dont get you sorry. im now opening the link you just gave me

[positive]	[16:30]	<red_>	mut80r thanks. be back in a while
[negative]	[16:30]	<eternal_p>	schnootop: the best thing is to throw the error into google with the word ubuntu @ the end
[positive]	[16:30]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: ok, that's a bit different.  if you look at the grub screen, there will be an option to edit the boot command line.  something is awry in it.

[negative]	[16:43]	<auruspex>	Hello IRC peoples. I've been having some problem with the Compiz effects in Hardy and I'm at my wits end so I figure I'd come here to see if you guys had any ideas. The thread with details is here: @HLINK
[positive]	[16:43]	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: some computers require surround to be enabled
[neutral]	[16:43]	<I5487>	Hi, i need help. i have downoaded the latest ubuntu, but when i type in another language its not fully support any idea regarding this issue?
[neutral]	[16:43]	<J-Unit>	mut80r, o so pid means process id?
[negative]	[16:43]	<yahya__>	mut80r, i am not on the system, it keeps getting stuck on 70%, anything I can add to boot options to bypass it?
[neutral]	[16:43]	<nith>	"bazhang: virtual desktop is the linux original name for ubuntu's ""workspaces"""

[negative]	[16:43]	<amenado>	Creeture-> possibly, no other ones that can do such
[negative]	[16:43]	<Pinky>	I was hoping there was something like mod_proxy for ssh, so I wouldn't need to do anything w/ my firewall... oh well, I guess
[negative]	[16:43]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, -15 is not necessary, SIGTERM is the default behaviour
[positive]	[16:43]	<mut80r>	J-Unit: yes. it's a numerical value assigned to each process.
[neutral]	[16:43]	<AtomicSpark>	Haha. For lulz i opened my clock to see if gnome would freeze. it did. -_-
[neutral]	[16:43]	<bazhang>	auruspex: best to ask in #compiz for that
[positive]	[16:43]	<PhotoJim>	I5487: type only in English?  OK, that's a wisecrack answer. ;)
[negative]	[16:43]	<Ntemis>	please help i have installed koverartist but it dont show on the applications area, when i start it from command line it says : kbuildsycoca running...  and then this: kio (KMimeType): WARNING: KServiceType::offers : servicetype ThumbCreator not found  and this is the same for 8 lines!!!
[neutral]	[16:43]	<mut80r>	yahya__: stick a live cd in and mount your system and edit fstab there.
[negative]	[16:43]	<gapagos>	is there any way I could run iMovie on ubuntu since it's unix-based

[negative]	[16:44]	<Dante123>	amenado I already have hardy installed on another pc....so I have a feel for it and I like it so far.  Would running the livecd basically pick up the non-integrated card and install properly or do you think I will have to go through all the hassles again?
[neutral]	[16:44]	<JenFraggle>	please can someone help with a mouse problem on hardy.  thanks
[negative]	[16:44]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, the one you're looking for (if a program locked up or doesn't respond to -15) is SIGKILL (or -9)
[negative]	[16:44]	<El1>	Is there anybody who knows on which packages the hardware drivers manager depends? Or where I can look this up?
[neutral]	[16:44]	<bazhang>	gapagos: nay

[neutral]	[16:44]	<nith>	np

[neutral]	[16:44]	<pimplife>	installed
[positive]	[16:44]	<Millertime_018>	so it may be best to upgrade just the same
[positive]	[16:44]	<PhotoJim>	Millertime_018: this machine originally had dapper drake on it and it's upgraded nicely from there (so far).
[positive]	[16:44]	<El1>	***pimplife: welcome to hardy heron and nvidia :P
[negative]	[16:44]	<Millertime_018>	i'm just giving what i know photojim

[neutral]	[16:45]	<as2000>	is there a legacy driver for ati cards?
[negative]	[16:45]	<gapagos>	Creeture, thats something linux zealots should work on lol
[neutral]	[16:45]	<bazhang>	!away > Scrounch
[negative]	[16:45]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, so the syntax would be kill -9 PID, you can get the process ID through ps (man ps), alternatively, you could use killall to bypass the PS step, and directly give the name of processes to kill
[negative]	[16:45]	<Dante123>	amenado I already have hardy installed on another pc....so I have a feel for it and I like it so far.  Would running the livecd basically pick up the non-integrated card and install properly or do you think I will have to go through all the hassles again?
[negative]	[16:45]	<yahya__>	mut80r, I would have done that, but this is a problem of my n00b friend, he wont know how to mount his HDD linux partition. Nothing to just add to boot option, like edit them on boot?
[negative]	[16:45]	<|neon|>	? ASUS Laptop with screen light sensor, everytime i boot i have to change the file ls_switch from 1 to 0 in order to gain brightness control, otherwise the screen is too dark to be usable, how can i make this permanent instead of having o edit the file evrytime i boot
[neutral]	[16:45]	<Nigromante>	does anyone have gnome panel position problems with Ubuntu 8.4 (hardy)
[neutral]	[16:45]	<Nigromante>	?
[positive]	[16:45]	<mut80r>	yahya__: I believe it mounts the system and displays it on the desktop anyway. couldn't hurt to try

[negative]	[16:45]	<weaver>	hi. Ubuntu 8.04 won't install the bootloader during the installation, and manual bootloader install doesn't work :(

[negative]	[16:46]	<Millertime_018>	mattperry: i dont know that i can help then. i know that ubuntu separates volume a lot; like the pc speakers can be on high while the output audio may be quite

[positive]	[16:47]	<mut80r>	Wiredtape: if you're removing grub or ubuntu, after removing it you will need to reinstate the other OS'es bootloader. if it's vista you can do this from recovery options on the vista dvd. otherwise go into recovery mode from an XP cd

[negative]	[16:58]	<Ntemis>	anything to do to fix that i dont want to use the bash
[neutral]	[16:58]	<eternal_p>	all depends on how much free time yo uwant to have

[negative]	[17:00]	<errpast>	GoodJob, Isn't it in the repos
[negative]	[17:00]	<Nith>	J-Unit: as opposed to a Cisco router that costs much much more

[negative]	[17:00]	<bazhang>	GoodJob: that is no longer maintained, better to try xmms2 or audacious
[negative]	[17:00]	<J-Unit>	Nith, but my real question is: do i need to do anything software wise or is it all just like plug a cable here and there?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<Itaku>	OllieA: system>preferences> screen resolution
[negative]	[17:00]	<Nith>	dmsuperman: sorry but that's more of an XChat script thing. try googling but it isnt something the standard ubuntu power-user would know
[negative]	[17:00]	<crashanddie>	dmsuperman, not by default
[negative]	[17:00]	<tiax>	dmsuperman: well you could always type /lastlog dmsuperman or write a script to do it

[negative]	[17:00]	<trekkme>	in my xorg.conf i have put only a resolution of 1280x1024 but gnome/ubuntu always falls back to 800x600 what could be the prob?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: It's pretty much just stuff that uses lots of double-presision floating points and memory addressing over 4GB that will be affected, right?
[neutral]	[17:00]	<mut80r>	J-Unit: plug a cable between modem and router's internet port. plug cable between router and pc. restart modem. restart router.

[negative]	[17:02]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: You're right about that, I suppose - though there's plenty of tech I kick myself for not adopting earlier after the fact.

[neutral]	[17:04]	<GoodJob>	universe, hmmm
[negative]	[17:04]	<dmsuperman>	Nith, yeah, me too in XChat, but when I'm gone for a while and come back I can't see any such messages. I'll look for something like that though, i just wasn't sure what the feature is called that colors your name
[neutral]	[17:04]	<crashanddie>	dmsuperman, highlight

[negative]	[17:05]	<fstxx>	what is required to play dvd's in hardy? The official doc is still 7.10, it sya you should install libdvdplay0, but that is not in the hardy repository. running the install-css script seems to work, but then gxine core dumps.

[neutral]	[17:05]	<GoodJob>	it isn't fetched
[negative]	[17:05]	<su-hoens`rZ>	Kr0ntab and why did upgrading cause my etc/hosts file to get overwritten
[negative]	[17:05]	<doomskillet>	eternal_p: So, when everything starts to run smoothly on the 64-bit distro, I can just go ahead and upgrade. I doubt I'll notice any performance improvement on the 64-bit distro, anyway - at least, not enough to counter-balance the headaches I'm bound to encounter with the proprietary crap that we're still forced to deal with.
[negative]	[17:05]	<OllieA>	How do I add a screen resolution to the drop down box in System => Preferences => Screen Resolution...
[negative]	[17:05]	<GoodJob>	don't know why :/

[neutral]	[18:25]	<enfefi>	I need help with the time in Ubuntu 8.04. At boot time I got this error: 8254 Timer not connected to IO-ACPI and in Gnome the time is wrong. My machine is a Pavilion zx5369cl laptop
[negative]	[18:25]	<pyrak>	and i can't adjust the resolution to be above 800x600
[negative]	[18:25]	<dreamcoder>	should i use 64bit or 32bit?
[neutral]	[18:25]	<_alf_>	mindlord: i think it's built into xorg. i don't have anything like that running either, and yet my alt-tab rotates windows in 3d
[positive]	[18:25]	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: nuthin is extreme if it allows u 365+ uptime :)
[neutral]	[18:25]	<herbaliser>	wishie no
[negative]	[18:25]	<amenado>	keycool1-> then you proly have to hunt around what drivers supports your cisco aeronet..
[negative]	[18:25]	<NightBird>	amenado: okay, how do I set it to either try the 8139too driver, or(worst case), disable ethernet completely?
[negative]	[18:25]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: how much ram
[neutral]	[18:25]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: but I would doublecheck that before hand.  boot from a live cd and see...
[positive]	[18:25]	<fiXXXerMet>	How reliable is a live update from 7.10 to 8.04?  Is it best to format and start clean?
[negative]	[18:25]	<g0th_>	hmm, bitchx was removed from ubuntu 8.04?
[neutral]	[18:25]	<dreamcoder>	1gb
[negative]	[18:25]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: ok, thanks. But it's very strange, because I could connect on this pc, which has the same card
[neutral]	[18:25]	<ruewan>	someone told me 32
[positive]	[18:25]	<agnul>	uhm... yay for me! just moving the themes from my home folder to usr/share/themes did the trick
[neutral]	[18:25]	<bazhang>	32 bit dreamcoder
[positive]	[18:25]	<lch_>	dreamcoder: when you ask? 32 bits ;-)
[negative]	[18:25]	<_alf_>	g0th_: yeah, it has security issues
[neutral]	[18:25]	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, it says 2.6.24-16-generic
[positive]	[18:25]	<plik>	g0th_: irssi ftw :)
[negative]	[18:25]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: yeah then its likely a card issue...
[negative]	[18:25]	<Marce_>	z0g, yes it is... it appears to be running... i can only get working with nv driver, with nvidia one xorg crashes by that reason :/
[negative]	[18:25]	<_alf_>	g0th_: yeah, irssi
[negative]	[18:25]	<Laser88>	OldSocks: it's somewhere here - ~/.mozilla/firefox
[neutral]	[18:25]	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, thats the right kernel correcT?
[positive]	[18:25]	<bazhang>	Auctionedllama: then you are final! ;]
[negative]	[18:26]	<mindlord>	_alf_, I don't think upgrading from gutsy to hardy turned it on.
[neutral]	[18:26]	<g0th_>	kk
[positive]	[18:26]	<dreamcoder>	i thought 64bit had speed increases though?
[neutral]	[18:26]	<Al-Khouli>	guys, SOS, i am facing this damned error in the middle of upgrading to hardy: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[negative]	[18:26]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: I'll try with another live-cd
[negative]	[18:26]	<z0g>	Marce_, it sounds weird :/
[neutral]	[18:26]	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, yip, the day after I installed i had 300 megs of upgrades
[negative]	[18:26]	<z0g>	tried installing the driver using synaptic?
[negative]	[18:26]	<J-Unit>	"fiXXXerMet, everything u sudo apt-got will remain other apps wont, thats all i can say but upgrading is better since u dont have to ""restart ur life"""
[neutral]	[18:26]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: also... try rebooting without the nic plugged in... and retry
[negative]	[18:26]	<amenado>	NightBird-> try to boot from the liveCD and see if it detects same chips, and see if you get same errors
[positive]	[18:26]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: only if you dislike youtube ;]
[negative]	[18:26]	<keycool1>	amenado: I've been looking, can't seem to find, not sure I know where is best to look
[negative]	[18:26]	<NightBird>	amenado: I'm botting from the liveCD, and getting the same errors
[negative]	[18:26]	<Marce_>	z0g, nop, i'll do it
[negative]	[18:26]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: trying to see if anything on the switch/router is locking it up.
[negative]	[18:26]	<dreamcoder>	i managed to get flash working in a 32bit browser on kubuntu 8.04
[neutral]	[18:26]	<z0g>	:?
[neutral]	[18:26]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: nic plugged in?
[positive]	[18:26]	<z0g>	*:>
[positive]	[18:26]	<Marce_>	:D
[neutral]	[18:26]	<amenado>	keycool1-> which cisco model do you have?
[negative]	[18:26]	<dreamcoder>	it would work the same on ubuntu am i right?
[negative]	[18:26]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: what's that?
[neutral]	[18:26]	<Marce_>	brb
[negative]	[18:26]	<z0g>	did the trick for me Marce_
[negative]	[18:27]	<_alf_>	"mindlord: tell me this, if you go into system, preference, apperance, visualization and then select the ""Extra"" option. does it ask you to restart or anything?"
[negative]	[18:27]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: nic = network interface card...
[negative]	[18:27]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: I meant flash and 64 bit have a bit of a hassle getting going
[negative]	[18:27]	<amenado>	NightBird-> cant do much then if your liveCD also detects same,  how about older 7.10 livecd ?
[negative]	[18:27]	<Marce_>	zog, but i wanted to have propertary drivers working :(
[negative]	[18:27]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: as I said, I have a dual-boot with Windows, and it is working... :(
[negative]	[18:27]	<Juanfer>	FIREFOX and SYNAPTIC Not Connecting.... why this happens?
[neutral]	[18:27]	<dreamcoder>	okie
[negative]	[18:27]	<NightBird>	amenado: those work fine.  is there no way to boot the livecd with that driver disabled?
[neutral]	[18:27]	<amenado>	keycool1-> which cisco model do you have?  many aeronet versions and models
[positive]	[18:27]	<lch_>	dreamcoder: i use 64bits as base and have a 32 bit ubuntu in a chroot for the browser with plugins. butu using 32bits directly is easier :-)
[neutral]	[18:27]	<Al-Khouli>	how to solve this error: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[neutral]	[18:27]	<Al-Khouli>	??
[neutral]	[18:27]	<keycool1>	amenado: I bet....how can I check?
[positive]	[18:28]	<amenado>	NightBird-> you have not installed 8.04 yet?
[negative]	[18:28]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: ahh okay...
[neutral]	[18:28]	<g0th>	hi
[positive]	[18:28]	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: another point is install fluxbox, that bypasses a lot of the gnome desktop crud,  simply sudo apt-get install fluxbox, at the GDM greeter, go to change session at bottom right, select fluuxbox, you right-click for the menu, most stuff in applications at top of list, just avoid using nautilus as a noob with fluxbox ;)   If no fluxbox probs then ur prooblem maybe gnomey-related
[neutral]	[18:28]	<amenado>	keycool1-> labels on the device perhaps?
[neutral]	[18:28]	<g0th>	(I now have irssi)
[negative]	[18:28]	<Laser88>	juanfer: anything else connecting?
[positive]	[18:28]	<plik>	g0th: welcome to the club, - enjoy  :)
[negative]	[18:28]	<pyrak>	i'm having problems with my video card.  i logged in as a different user, and no luck.  it was working fine until i plugged this machine into a projector.  help!
[negative]	[18:28]	<NightBird>	amenado: I tried to do an upgrade from 7.10, but it locked up my computer nearing the end, and it may have wiped out the driver my /home/ partition was on
[negative]	[18:28]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: yeah im sorry mate.  i do need to step out though.  sorry i couldnt help ya out for now.
[neutral]	[18:28]	<g0th>	so another issue: when I compile my kernel with make-kpkg binary-arch, I get this message:

[positive]	[18:29]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: ok, thanks for trying to help me :)
[negative]	[18:29]	<mindlord>	_alf_ no, but I've used compiz on this computer before without lockups or anything, I just turned it all off for speed. Only 1ghz cpu
[negative]	[18:29]	<g0th>	what directory do they mean?
[neutral]	[18:29]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: no sweat.
[neutral]	[18:29]	<amenado>	NightBird-> it should not wipe out your /home  if you have it in separate partitions..try to boot from older 7.10 livecd?
[negative]	[18:29]	<keycool1>	amenado: its internal, and it doesn't seem to say on the bottom of the laptop either
[negative]	[18:29]	<jytd>	does hamachi work on ubuntu? Anybody tried this out?
[neutral]	[18:29]	<_alf_>	mindlord: it'll make the gpu hot, upping the system temperature. i doubt it'll make the cpu hot
[positive]	[18:30]	<amenado>	keycool1-> cisco is a well known brand perhaps if you can visit your vendors web site to dig info?
[neutral]	[18:30]	<herghost>	ompaul: thankyou, that link you found sorted my problem completely.  thanks for helping
[positive]	[18:30]	<Juanfer>	pointer DISSAPEARS when wake-up, but still working
[negative]	[18:30]	<_alf_>	mindlord: if its cpu overheating issues you can pretty much ignore everything i've told you
[neutral]	[18:30]	<mindlord>	gor1, I'll try that. It hasn't locked up in about 45 minutes now.. It might be dirty power since I moved it.

[neutral]	[18:30]	<soop>	simple question ... how can i change the length of a gnome desktop panel?
[positive]	[18:30]	<Laser88>	how to answer juanfer? :-)
[negative]	[18:30]	<keycool1>	amenado: ok great, thanks for the help. also, should I assume I'm looking for a driver now, is that the issue?
[neutral]	[18:31]	<bazhang>	Juanfer: try ping google
[negative]	[18:31]	<jytd>	gor1, Ok, and it's not in the repository, right?
[negative]	[18:31]	<Laser88>	Juanfer: does anything else connect?
[neutral]	[18:31]	<lch_>	Juanfer: but the network is working otherwise?

[negative]	[18:51]	<mark_>	blackirish-> that happened to me, I had to manually edit the file in /etc and change my virtual desktop size to match the resolution
[neutral]	[18:52]	<NightBird>	amenado: could I set it to do that when booting from the live cd?
[negative]	[18:52]	<unzzi>	I just tried to start Hardy from CD I got console (BusyBox or something). What gives? It does that if I select 'install Ubuntu' or 'try without installing'.

[neutral]	[18:56]	<mark_>	rotw I put it there and ran rebooted, but it still does not show
[positive]	[18:56]	<_alf_>	just_bob: i think php-pear is fine for php5: apt-cache search php5 | grep pear
[negative]	[18:56]	<shigutso>	where is the Shared Folders icon in Ubuntu 8.04? I can't share a folder because I don't have permissions to do that...
[negative]	[18:56]	<gnomefreak>	Musicalduck: make sure the desktop package is intalled, but you might have better luck in #ubuntustudio or #ubuntu-studio (cant remember what one it is)
[negative]	[18:56]	<bastones>	Hello. I am trying to install Ubuntu from the CD I received a few days ago, and it begins to load with the orange bar and it gets to just about the middle and freezes. I tried addong noapic from F6 but that didn't fix it either. Anyone got any solutions, as I really want to get away from Microsoft Windows.
[neutral]	[18:56]	<bazhang>	xSnOoPyx: not sure; you need to provide more info
[neutral]	[18:56]	<Seven_Six_Two>	Musicalduck, did you install the rt kernel?

[neutral]	[18:56]	<bazhang>	bastones: try the alternate cd
[positive]	[18:56]	<DB42>	no #ubuntu+1 ? :) what about 8.10 :)
[negative]	[18:56]	<keycool1>	amenado: would my card be the aironet 350 mini-pci wireless lan client adapter or the aironet 350 wireless lan client adapter?
[neutral]	[18:56]	<polcany>	oki
[negative]	[18:57]	<uwo>	tnx all, was hoping for someting like automatix to still exits - not because of codecs, but skype, realplayer, google earth... all in one place
[neutral]	[18:57]	<mark_>	rotw Yes, there too, I ran fc-cache and rebooted after that as well. worked with a ttf but not fon
[negative]	[18:57]	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: Idk really whats wrong, i was on gutsy and  i updated to hardy and now it just doesnt work.

[neutral]	[18:57]	<yao_ziyuan>	continue my last question:

[neutral]	[18:57]	<amenado>	keycool1-> hard for me to tell, its not infront of me...read what your laptop vendor says about your model

[neutral]	[18:57]	<bazhang>	!alternate | bastones
[positive]	[18:57]	<ubotu>	bastones: The Alternate CD is a classical text-mode install CD. It supports a wider range of hardware than the !LiveCD, and can also be used as an upgrade CD.  Look for the alternate checkbox on the Ubuntu download page - See also !minimal - Torrent at @HLINK
[negative]	[18:57]	<rotw>	mark_: hum. try and google it, ya never know, someone might've had the same problem. if not, look for a converter
[negative]	[18:57]	<_alf_>	just_bob i dunno about the others. if they are pear scripts use the pear you just installed to get them
[neutral]	[18:57]	<noozz>	Gokee2: dont know what that is

[negative]	[18:58]	<Gokee2>	noob13, Hmm SO you see bootup right?  Its just when x start (right before the login screen) it blanks?
[neutral]	[18:58]	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: i think it said something about boot/grub
[negative]	[18:58]	<xSnOoPyx>	bazhang: some kind of folder like that i dont remember. that may have been the problem.

[negative]	[18:59]	<hansin>	Does anyone thing there would be a problem if I did a minimal CLI install from the 8.04 beta CD, and apt-get updated from there?  Or should I really download the offcial 8.04 release CD and go from there?  I'd rather avoid wasting the bandwith and CD if I could, but if there is a problem installing from the 8.04 beta and upgrading I would.  Agian, I am only looking for a minimal CLI install, so it is much more basic that the full install

[negative]	[19:23]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[negative]	[19:23]	<Makdaam>	so I'll end up with clean X after uninstalling esound?

[negative]	[19:23]	<gnomefreak>	Makdaam: esound is a major package leave it and just change the what you use to oss or something else
[positive]	[19:23]	<Pelo>	bigtimer121, look on the forum for the error msg ,  www.ubuntuforums.org

[negative]	[19:23]	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, hm i tried myself in the open dialog and failed, you are correct it doesn't work that way. I guess this functionality is not supported by gnome yet. What I do regulaly is to sftp to a site through nautilus and open a file in text editor and works fine
[neutral]	[19:23]	<Exteris>	pixelmonkey, i do have a lot of setgrabkeysstate, perhaps that's because of my window manager

[neutral]	[19:24]	<djlenoir>	Pelo, it must be the first hdd, first partition, because no partitions existed before. I just booted from the CD and ran GParted... it shows it as /dev/sda1 (ext3) with the swap on /dev/sda5 (linux-swap).
[negative]	[19:24]	<absn1>	its not working on also, says device being used by another app when i hit test

[negative]	[19:26]	<cgentry72>	bazhang, i have but there is nothing to update, does that sound right?
[positive]	[19:26]	<hou5ton>	LuitvD: thanks ... is there an advantage to one over the other?
[negative]	[19:26]	<cellofellow>	hi there. I've a weird problem. I can't log in with GDM anymore. (Using Gutsy) I get very weird errors about GTK being run setuid and, well, let me see if I can pastebin.
[negative]	[19:26]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I just switched to the nv driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and I'm getting better performance.  I think there is some regression in the nvidia driver + X.org + possibly GNOME stuff like cairo.
[neutral]	[19:26]	<daemon3>	8 hours to complete the upgrade!!!!????!!!??
[neutral]	[19:26]	<Piteco>	yes i now
[neutral]	[19:26]	<gerardoj>	cvasilak: thanks anyway
[neutral]	[19:26]	<bazhang>	cgentry72: what kernel vesion? uname -r will tell
[neutral]	[19:26]	<bigtimer121>	k that worked, now my nvidia-glx will be removed
[negative]	[19:26]	<Piteco>	but does not work
[negative]	[19:26]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I don't get 3D with the nv driver, but I can live without that for now.
[negative]	[19:26]	<LuitvD>	hou5ton: as of yet I don't think there's an advantage of the 64-bit version...
[neutral]	[19:26]	<daemon3>	14 HOURS!!!!!!??????

[neutral]	[19:26]	<Rtrick>	Has anyone gotten Netflix working ?
[negative]	[19:26]	<gnomefreak>	bigtimer121: without seeing it i cant tell you exactly what is going to happen
[negative]	[19:26]	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, maybe because they have restructured the IO layer in gnome with the introduction of gio and this feature was too late to implement but i agree with you its a handy feature for some people
[neutral]	[19:26]	<cgentry72>	bazhang, 2.6.24-16-generic
[negative]	[19:26]	<Pelo>	djlenoir, ok  reboot the comp, when you get to the boot menu ,  select the correct menu option and type E to edit ,  find the root line and change it to root (hd0,0) ,    then type enter to accept and type b to boot ,  you'll hve to chagne it manaly in the /boot/grub/menu.lst file once you have booted,  changes from the menu are not permanent

[negative]	[19:27]	<bigtimer121>	can i remove it and then try and use the add/remove application
[negative]	[19:27]	<LuitvD>	hou5ton: there's more hassle with java and flash and stuff, so if you don't want issues, the regular i386 would be the safe choice
[negative]	[19:27]	<Exteris>	pixelmonkey, is it much faster? how did you measure performance? because i might switch back too then
[negative]	[19:27]	<lethalamby>	I had to recreate my swap partition

[neutral]	[19:28]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris well, my measurements are informal right now, just based on using things.
[negative]	[19:28]	<Piteco>	how can I fix it?

[negative]	[19:28]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris but basically, with the nvidia driver, Evolution uses about 50% CPU during normal usage (e.g., selecting/reading e-mails) and with nv, it's back down to 0-5% where it should be.
[positive]	[19:28]	<Exteris>	nl2br, i have the same card, the restricted drivers work fine
[neutral]	[19:28]	<danbhfive>	nl2br: use the restricted drivers manager

[negative]	[21:39]	<tato>	mehal88: for example, the panel bar appears in the main screen, while in the extended screen it doesn't. In my case the panel bar doesn't appear in any screen.
[negative]	[21:39]	<zvacet>	xubean : that is good,because now you should see message in update manager new version available

[negative]	[21:40]	<xubean>	zvacet: that's exactly what I'm saying... the update manager tells me i'm uptodate version wise as well.. i mean, it doesn't show a new version available!!! :(
[negative]	[21:40]	<TimMatrix>	chris_probl: the problem is that I can't get the wireless working on my wife's laptop, running on Live Ubuntu 8.04.  I needed to make sure that it all works, including wireless capability, before I wipe off her Vista OS and install Ubuntu 8.04.

[negative]	[21:41]	<chris_probl>	TimMatrix : oh, i thought you couldnt write to hard drive
[negative]	[21:41]	<Some_Person>	GoodJob: this is just about decreasing memory usage, which shouldn't apply when it's actually leaking. It increases memory usage on every click. something is wrong
[neutral]	[21:41]	<zvacet>	xubean : that is strage

[negative]	[21:42]	<chris_probl>	TimMatrix: no, i haave no idea what to do w/ wireless
[neutral]	[21:42]	<Jordan_U>	Scurz, Ubuntu does not produce drivers, almost everything in Ubuntu comes from debian which in turn comes from separate open source projects

[neutral]	[21:42]	<chris_probl>	QuadF: what Resolution options do you have
[negative]	[21:42]	<tato>	mehal88: ahh weird, I figured a way around the problem, setting the positions myself, something like --pos 0x0 for the left screen (monitor) and --pos 1024x0 for the laptop screen.

[neutral]	[21:43]	<chris_probl>	QuadF: what is the default resolution for your moniter?
[negative]	[21:43]	<TimMatrix>	loosid:  will this work if I run off LiveCD on Ubuntu 8.04?  Or it needs to be installed first and then sort the problem out?
[positive]	[21:43]	<Some_Person>	GoodJob: so basically i have to live with it until fixed... *sigh*

[neutral]	[21:43]	<TimMatrix>	where do I find this.  My wife's laptop contains a Atheros Wireless Device.
[positive]	[21:43]	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, You should file a bug and in the mean time you can install Firefox2 ( or if you want something fast new and interesting try epiphany-webkit though you will have to compile it yourself :)
[negative]	[21:43]	<bagelong>	cjs3141:  Still nothing.  unless you think we need 1-2 more steps I think I'll call it quits
[negative]	[21:44]	<Musicalduck>	hey, if i boot up ubunutu, i can get past the splash page then all that shows is s screen of peach, white and flashing blocks with no coherent graphics
[positive]	[21:44]	<loosid>	TimMatrix: You should be able to do this from the live CD.  What you need is an application called ndiswrapper (Windows Wireless Drivers is a GUI frontend).
[negative]	[21:44]	<GoodJob>	Some_Person, that's because in gutsy we had the luxury to use a non-beta firefox version

[positive]	[21:45]	<Jordan_U>	Some_Person, Try installing the Human theme, that will make it look closer to ff3, but really you should file a bug against Firefox to get this problem resolved ( and be sure to mention that it still happens in safe mode )

[neutral]	[22:23]	<flyback>	and therefore won't change anything
[negative]	[22:24]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Wow that was fast. Instantaneous. Succeeded and Done.
[negative]	[22:24]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, now, windows is not in your grub config, but don't worry we can get that put in there.
[neutral]	[22:24]	<testola>	"josh04_: yes i tried that. And also to reinstall the nvidia drivers through the ""hardware settings"" in system... That was working fine before... I got the message that screen resolution could not be detected"
[negative]	[22:24]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Ok
[positive]	[22:24]	<tomd123>	flyback: ya, I guess you have a point to move to a different distro then, but I would surely miss the simplicity :)
[neutral]	[22:24]	<patzz>	i'm lost

[neutral]	[22:24]	<patzz>	any help??

[negative]	[22:25]	<testola>	josh04_: Then using xorg.conf.failsafe to restore... but then i get 800x resolution...
[negative]	[22:25]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, one second let me google what the grub line should be for that, wise choice, don't use vista, I have heard nothing but bad. lol
[negative]	[22:25]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yeah. Vista is a resource hog.
[neutral]	[22:25]	<flyback>	heh
[negative]	[22:25]	<testola>	josh04_: thanx anyway.. anyone know of any tutorials on the new xorg.conf file

[neutral]	[22:26]	<oddalot>	hip hip
[neutral]	[22:26]	<josh04_>	testola: the xorg.conf file can be edited in the same way, it just uses autoconfiguration for most of it, so the file in /etc/X11 is a skeleton file
[neutral]	[22:26]	<anemptygun>	hooray
[positive]	[22:26]	<shane2peru>	MrObvious, yeah, I have heard a lot of bad., worse yet they are going to cut XP, that will be cutting their own throat.
[negative]	[22:26]	<Shpook>	Only reason I would like a native solution is because with ndiswrapper, I still had to bind the network to wlan0 every time I booted up. I would prefer it all to be automatic.

[neutral]	[22:27]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: You can have ndiswrapper run on bootup.

[negative]	[22:27]	<Felix>	could someone help me ? , in gusty i was able to change screen resolution , select a monitor and configure my video card, but in hardy i can only change resolution , is there a graphical way like in 7.10 to select a monitor and video card for hardy ?

[neutral]	[22:27]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: I don't remember how but it's possible.
[positive]	[22:27]	<Steven1>	Felix: You probably don't have the restricted drivers set up anymore. Mine was the same way.
[negative]	[22:28]	<patzz>	@HLINK Channel is #CA_Priv
[negative]	[22:28]	<Shpook>	MrObvious: That's how I had it before, and ndiswrapper would load but network-manager would never find the network. I had to use iwconfig to bind the network to the interface
[neutral]	[22:28]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, then:  sudo mount /dev/hdb4 /mnt/ubuntu
[negative]	[22:28]	<MrObvious>	Shpook: It's in /etc/modules IIRC and it's just like modprobe ndiswrapper on bootup automatically.
[positive]	[22:28]	<Shpook>	MrObvious: It was pretty annoying. :-)
[positive]	[22:28]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, are ya with me?

[neutral]	[22:29]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, no I mean : quit
[neutral]	[22:29]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: I think it might be permissions in your home directory in one of the . files.
[negative]	[22:29]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: That's just a guess though.
[negative]	[22:29]	<Shpook>	MrObvious: Well, I just installed Heron on a clean slate, so maybe I'll give it another go with ndiswrapper. I don't want to spend forever fighting with it.
[negative]	[22:29]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: Yeah just figured that out. Opened a new terminal and ran the command no replies.

[negative]	[22:29]	<Felix>	but my point is , how could I configure my monitor or videocard in gnome ? i was able in 7.10 but that option is gone in 8.04
[neutral]	[22:30]	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: sudo apt-get install distro-upgrade

[negative]	[22:30]	<FooAtari>	hmm, ok MrObvious ill see what I can see.  I noticed that onece it was starting klibido that caused the reboot, wonder if there is a permissions issue there.  I reinstalled not long ago so see if that helps
[negative]	[22:30]	<red22>	who was it helping me with mouse/xorg 15 mins ago pls?

[negative]	[22:31]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: So now Windows will be in the boot load list?
[neutral]	[22:31]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: I would just create a new user and then just move all your documents to the new user's home directory and set stuff up again.
[negative]	[22:31]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ahh, wait
[neutral]	[22:31]	<MrObvious>	FooAtari: Then you can delete the old one and use your old user/pass.
[negative]	[22:31]	<Steven1>	shane2peru: 'cp: cannot stat `/boot/grub/menu.lst': No such file or directory'
[negative]	[22:31]	<Felix>	yup i can set resolution there but in 7.10 i was able to change resolution and configure my video card too, how do i configure video card in hardy ?

[negative]	[22:35]	<alabamahit>	Can someone please tell me if 8.04 is stable and ready to be used by a (newbie) Or should i stay with 7.10.
[negative]	[22:35]	<MrObvious>	alabamahit: I think I would give it a while. You really aren't gaining much honestly.

[negative]	[22:35]	<pr4bh>	i was thinking if there was any way of modifying grub so that it gives the option 'run' the bootable vista files on the other partition
[neutral]	[22:35]	<Steven1>	xyzpaw: Some.
[negative]	[22:35]	<nickrud>	alabamahit, no reason not to upgrade that I've seen, but waiting a couple weeks (in case some really bad bug crops up) won't hurt
[neutral]	[22:35]	<Jack_Sparrow>	alabamahit, wait a week and watch for problems.. if this is your everyday setup
[neutral]	[22:35]	<testola>	restarting...
[positive]	[22:35]	<FooAtari>	alabamahit, its a step up from 7.10, better hardware support and is LTS so will be supported until 2011 I think it is
[negative]	[22:35]	<xyzpaw>	steven1: why not all?
[negative]	[22:36]	<MrObvious>	alabamahit: I say that just because it's just we need a couple weeks to get things up and running better.

[negative]	[22:36]	<Bidget>	so is hardy out yet? if so how do I update to it?
[negative]	[22:36]	<Anza>	Hi, I have one question. Since I upgraded to the latest Ubuntu version, in most of my mp3 files would appear at the end: (invalid encoding)  and those that have that are wrote in other language or using accents, it's terrible to have to fix it manually on each one, how can I do to make this recognize them??????????
[positive]	[22:36]	<Jack_Sparrow>	alabamahit, support will inpove over the next week as well
[negative]	[22:36]	<shane2peru>	Steven1, ok, great, now when you reboot, it will default to Linux, if you want Windows you will need to scroll down to the bottom.

[neutral]	[23:04]	<lee_>	or it will break lol
[neutral]	[23:05]	<Some_Person>	It's strange though. I used the official FF3 beta 5 on gutsy without issues.
[negative]	[23:05]	<porta-Farhan>	what i can't figure out is why i start a init/d service and then I have to stop it then run it as -d in root to get it to work

[negative]	[23:06]	<FooAtari>	i use antivir mkquist or did toy mean from within linux?
[negative]	[23:06]	<ferris_>	djlenoir, start the reinstallation process, and then manually edit the partitions. Delete them and restart your computer. It will break the partitions and then you are free to restart the process... but only if you have a single OS, or want to have a single os on the drive....
[neutral]	[23:06]	<Platyhelminth>	I didn't try but i am afraid to try

[neutral]	[23:07]	<Some_Person>	"porta-Farhan: to get a ""real"" installation on a partition, boot the cd"
[neutral]	[23:07]	<DjViper->	porta-Farhan: booting and installing will install it 'permanently', wubi is like a demo

[negative]	[23:07]	<porta-Farhan>	ah
[negative]	[23:07]	<Justin125>	I'm currently running Ubuntu via Wubi but now I'm satisfied with Ubuntu I want to do a full install with a seperate parition ect. Do I have to do a full fresh install?
[negative]	[23:07]	<porta-Farhan>	yeah
[negative]	[23:07]	<porta-Farhan>	you do
[neutral]	[23:08]	<CJS3141>	amazen720: Did you mention what it was you burned to disk in Vista? I didn't catch that... was it data/sound/video or what?

[neutral]	[23:08]	<Bidget>	hey has anyone else recently upgraded to hardy?
[negative]	[23:08]	<Some_Person>	porta-Farhan: not entirely, Wubi just installs to a file on your windows partition and boots that
[negative]	[23:08]	<Some_Person>	porta-Farhan: in my opinion, it doesn't work very well
[negative]	[23:08]	<porta-Farhan>	so soemone could actually live with a wubi install of ubuntu and be fine
[negative]	[23:08]	<doorknob60>	can someone give me a link on how to disable ivp6, it might be causing problems with my wifi
[negative]	[23:08]	<porta-Farhan>	hmm interesting
[negative]	[23:08]	<ferris_>	Bidget, I did twice yesterday
[neutral]	[23:08]	<Bidget>	ferris_, how long did it take?

[positive]	[23:23]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: I may be in for the same issue when I update to 8.04 as well.
[negative]	[23:23]	<towlie>	Dekkard, ive got a few problems that bug the crap out of me
[neutral]	[23:24]	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[positive]	[23:24]	<Dekkard>	my first clean ubuntu instal since feisty
[negative]	[23:24]	<krash3x>	nope this was the first time I used ubuntu since 5.xx
[neutral]	[23:24]	<towlie>	Dekkard, problems specific to hardy
[negative]	[23:24]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if the problem is already solved in the newer kernels, than it is a matter of getting the Ubuntu devs to include the patch.  OR, you could do it yourself.
[negative]	[23:24]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: the LKML seems to have one entry at least on this, without an answer
[neutral]	[23:24]	<Dekkard>	like?
[negative]	[23:24]	<ferris_>	djlenoir, go ahead and create the partition, click the check box to format and then once it is finished writing the partitions restart the computer (hard reset)
[neutral]	[23:24]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, well i didnt update, did fresh install to try to fix the wireless issue i've had for nearly 5 months
[negative]	[23:24]	<Bidget>	UH OH
[negative]	[23:24]	<ferris_>	you could also get a boot disk and kill the partitions as well
[negative]	[23:24]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, ugh, no answer? bad news
[negative]	[23:24]	<Bidget>	I was updating to hardy and it failed :(
[negative]	[23:25]	<InfernoX222>	Hello all, I dont mean to bother anyone but i am having some major issues (major for a newb that is...) anyone have a few moments to help?
[negative]	[23:25]	<djlenoir>	ferris, Ok I will do that then.
[positive]	[23:25]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: my personal interest in this is just as far as my gf in concerned (her PC), I don't have those issues here on my gentoo machine :-)

[negative]	[23:25]	<Scunizi>	How do I find out which version of java I have installed?
[negative]	[23:25]	<Dekkard>	towlie,  whats buggin ya?
[positive]	[23:25]	<amazen720>	CJS3141: I found a old CD I burned using XP, to put LINKSYS drivers on it, and it mounted fine
[neutral]	[23:25]	<ferris_>	Xbehave..... are you sure you still have it?
[negative]	[23:25]	<Bidget>	"I got a whole bunch of errors while updating to hardy, and they were all ""failed to fetch http://(blahblahblah) connection failed"""
[positive]	[23:26]	<CJS3141>	InfernoX222: Just ask your question, and wait patiently to see if someone can answer it :)
[neutral]	[23:26]	<krash3x>	do we need to install the 32 lib on the nvidia driver with 64 bit
[negative]	[23:26]	<Bidget>	and if it didnt say connection failed, it said connection timed out
[negative]	[23:26]	<InfernoX222>	well i got a DLink DWA-643 that i cant get to work with madwifi or even turn on... I also cant seem to get into a non X server mode to update my nvidia drivers
[negative]	[23:26]	<Xbehave>	yes i just mounted the partition
[negative]	[23:26]	<amazen720>	CJS3141: then you're right it's Vista

[neutral]	[23:26]	<Bidget>	?
[positive]	[23:26]	<ferris_>	Xbehave..... you will need to edit the menu.lst file
[neutral]	[23:26]	<mng51971>	then you get no errors
[negative]	[23:26]	<Justin125>	Can someone just tell me if the % drag bar partition option in 8.04 install will be fine for a vista dual boot?

[positive]	[23:27]	<Jordan_U>	Bidget, System -> Administration -> Software Sources -> Mirror -> Other -> Choose best
[positive]	[23:27]	<InfernoX222>	justin125 i am running that way it works fine for me
[neutral]	[23:27]	<Bidget>	k
[negative]	[23:27]	<Xbehave>	i no haw to edit menu.lst but no idea what to add to grub for it
[negative]	[23:27]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, hehehe, I see.  Well, my relatively uninformed opinion is that it is probably a kernel issue, related to the move to the SCSI subsystem for PATA drives.  And if I were you, in this case I'd try to either use an older kernel, or try to recompile the current one turning off this PATA/SATA thing.
[negative]	[23:27]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, hey, before i shutdown and installed 8.04 I copied my fstab to a USB flash drive, would it be safe to just copy and paste that one line into the new fstab? wouldn't use the same UUID?

[negative]	[23:28]	<Bidget>	Jordan_U, oh ok
[negative]	[23:28]	<noel__>	how can i get this lib (libdbus-glib-1.so.2) i need it for cairo-dock 1.5.5.2?

[negative]	[23:28]	<fred101>	hello, does anyone here know how to get xubuntu 8.04 working on a via EPIA-SP board? It crashes on boot, the caps-lock light doesn't illuminate when I press it.  I can boot to single user mode, but thats useless.
[neutral]	[23:28]	<amazen720>	CJS3141: will do

[positive]	[23:28]	<tseug>	i've upgraded to Hardy, a fresh install.  now how do i delete my old version (it's taking up space)?
[negative]	[23:28]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: To tell you the truth, I'm unsure.  At least you can use the old fstab as a reference and compare to the new one.  Of course, make backup of the new fstab, but perhaps then you try to edit/add the line from the old copy.
[negative]	[23:29]	<devtrash>	tseug, there should be no old install
[neutral]	[23:29]	<unop>	noel__, try installing the libdbus-glib-1-2 package.  sudo aptitude install libdbus-glib-1-2

[negative]	[23:29]	<Xbehave>	ferris_:  if you have vista installed i could probably decifer it, could you send it over plz? pastebin?
[positive]	[23:29]	<tseug>	devtrash, but i can switch between my old desktop and the new one
[negative]	[23:29]	<kane77>	I'm planning to get more RAM, where does it save stuff when I'm hibernating? will I need bigger swap?
[negative]	[23:29]	<ffm>	tseug, is it on a separate partition?
[neutral]	[23:29]	<ffm>	tseug, delete it with gparted, but be careful.
[negative]	[23:29]	<tseug>	ffm, i think so.  i only want one

[neutral]	[23:56]	<Kovecses>	tomtommy, yup
[negative]	[23:56]	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, that isn't good, do you have the 8.04 disk handy?
[neutral]	[23:56]	<Abd>	tomtommy Yes hardy is out
[negative]	[23:56]	<tomtommy>	what program in Hardy can I use for webcam?
[negative]	[23:56]	<SonicStream>	Anyone have any help for what's going on with my printer?
[negative]	[23:56]	<androver>	SonicStream: try just choosing a printer that's like yours.  what's the exact printer model?
[negative]	[23:56]	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: nope
[neutral]	[23:56]	<aphan9>	so i think my wireless network card does work, however i dont think it can detect any wireless networks
[neutral]	[23:56]	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, does it boot?  What is the error?
[neutral]	[23:56]	<SonicStream>	androver: Brother MFC-240C
[positive]	[23:56]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, did you do a fresh new install?
[negative]	[23:56]	<djlenoir>	mkquist, no other OS installed, only hardy. other three hard drives do not even have a partition yet.
[neutral]	[23:56]	<q4a>	GIn, it freeze at this screen @HLINK after loading livecd
[neutral]	[23:56]	<tomtommy>	!webcam
[positive]	[23:56]	<ubotu>	Instructions for using webcams with Ubuntu can be found at @HLINK - Supported cams: @HLINK
[negative]	[23:56]	<mkquist>	djlenoir: where did you install grub?
[neutral]	[23:56]	<Platyhelminth>	yes tomtommy
[neutral]	[23:57]	<SonicStream>	:o
[positive]	[23:57]	<armada>	"man, mplayer's ""Stop XScreensaver"" option is full of problems"
[neutral]	[23:57]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, which one did you install?  alternative?
[negative]	[23:57]	<Abd>	aphan9 I had a similar problem, but I compiled the 2.6.25 kernel, and got my wireless back working
[negative]	[23:57]	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: upgrade froze on libpng, then a bunch of errors. It was pretty much gutsy. it was not customised
[negative]	[23:57]	<shane2peru>	djlenoir, if there isn't anything on the other hdd, just unplug them and see if you can boot off the one.
[negative]	[23:57]	<armada>	in gusty it would give that error
[neutral]	[23:57]	<djlenoir>	mkquist, hda1 (first SATA drive)
[neutral]	[23:57]	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: PITA
[neutral]	[23:57]	<armada>	and in hardy it makes sarting mplayer incredibly slow
[negative]	[23:57]	<fysa>	you ruined it, SpookyET.  how does it feel?
[negative]	[23:57]	<b4xt0r>	I am having trouble getting 2 sound cards to work together well, Would it be easier to use one sound card and map the output of Ventrilo to Aux for example, Speakers for everything else, and mic inpu?
[negative]	[23:57]	<aphan9>	abd how do u compile it, i'm not that good with that stuff lol
[positive]	[23:57]	<Platyhelminth>	tomtommy yes . I did an upgade with net but same error
[neutral]	[23:57]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, install Hardy Alternative ISO, not the liveCD one.  understood?
[negative]	[23:58]	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, before doing an upgrade, you should, 1.  backup, 2 have a new disk handy in case of failure
[neutral]	[23:58]	<mkquist>	djlenoir: id go w/spookyet suggestion, take them out of the equation  till u get it working
[negative]	[23:58]	<blankhead>	androver: no i uninstalled thru terminal with sudo apt-get remove awn-core-applets-bzr
[neutral]	[23:58]	<blankhead>	 it uninstalled successfully but now when i try to install avant thru add/remove it says Cannot install 'avant-window-navigator'
[neutral]	[23:58]	<blankhead>	This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'avant-window-navigator' the conflicting software must be removed first.
[positive]	[23:58]	<blankhead>	Switch to the 'synaptic' package manager to resolve this conflict.
[negative]	[23:58]	<FloodBot2>	blankhead: Please don't flood, use @HLINK to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[neutral]	[23:58]	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, that upgrade doesn't sound good.
[negative]	[23:58]	<Platyhelminth>	I did not try the liveCD tomtommy
[negative]	[23:58]	<djlenoir>	shane2peru, I will give that a try then.
[positive]	[23:58]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, listen carefully to what I am about to say :)   You should try a fresh and toally new install using ALTERNATIVE install
[neutral]	[23:58]	<SonicStream>	-.-
[negative]	[23:58]	<crc32>	where is the cryptmount-setup script for  cryptmount?
[negative]	[23:58]	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: it's a crap distro. Upgrades should not fail
[negative]	[23:58]	<shane2peru>	djlenoir, then go from there
[negative]	[23:58]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, have you tried that?
[negative]	[23:58]	<Abd>	I did with absolutely no problems. This site gave me a good help --> @HLINK
[neutral]	[23:58]	<Platyhelminth>	tomtommy it is what i did
[neutral]	[23:58]	<crc32>	or is there documentation for how to use cryptmount for ubuntu?
[negative]	[23:59]	<hayhay>	"x1250: Hi - Said you would help me later - Thanks for offer - I got my other box that I lost my video on (was booting to a black screen without video) back up and running - Had changed my ""System/Administration/Hardware Drivers/Nvidia/Enabled"" After reboot it was downhill from there - figured out how to go into safe - and did auto-repair of x-server. Wheww - What a stupid thing to do without backing up my files 1st...."
[negative]	[23:59]	<sunmao>	if somebody use squirrelmail pls pm me!!
[positive]	[23:59]	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, then go develop your own distro that doesn't fail on upgrades with 1,000s of users on 1,000s of different senarios.
[positive]	[23:59]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, did you install it on a new fresh empty partition?
[negative]	[23:59]	<Abd>	aphan9 I followed all the steps and nothing went wrong
[neutral]	[23:59]	<Platyhelminth>	YES
[neutral]	[23:59]	<Platyhelminth>	i saw you it
[neutral]	[23:59]	<Platyhelminth>	...
[neutral]	[23:59]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, try the livecd version now
[negative]	[23:59]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, does the livecd load?
[positive]	[23:59]	<androver>	blankhead: weird, it usually will tell you which software conflicts with it.  try what it says; go to synaptic, see if it shows a conflict there.
[negative]	[23:59]	<Jordan_U>	ferris_, I think I may have found one, I saw a reference implying that this could be compiled for linux @HLINK
[negative]	[23:59]	<Platyhelminth>	lol ok, i will download it then
[neutral]	[23:59]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, lol
[neutral]	[23:59]	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: Arch Linux? That's what I'm running on my laptop. I had Ubuntu on my parents pc. unmodified gutsy.
[negative]	[23:59]	<bigtimer121>	"i have just downloaded the compiz file and installed and restarted. I have selected the extra in the ""visual settings"", how do i customize things in compiz. i only have a apperance selection in preferences not an advanced preference"

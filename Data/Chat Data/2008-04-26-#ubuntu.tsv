However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL.

[none]	[00:34]	<kevin__>	josh04: Thank you.
[none]	[00:34]	<phixxor>	what does the DVD have that the CD does not
[none]	[00:34]	<seamus7>	happy_tux perhaps you're already fully updated
[none]	[00:34]	<userx86>	willie_ your sarcasm is appreciated as well

[positive]	[00:35]	<teamcobra>	Abd: sorted out in 2.6.25, there was  a weird conflict between your card's driver and the bcm4311rev2 that they just fixed
[none]	[00:35]	<Abd>	arrgghh

[none]	[00:35]	<Pelo>	phixxor, full  main and restricted repositories on the dvd , saves on some install download and  both live cd and text install

[none]	[00:35]	<IndyGunFreak>	poseidon: you need to run gksudo nvidia-settings
[none]	[00:35]	<otarid>	Pelo: How would I do that? (reconfiguring x-server)
[none]	[00:35]	<Wo0dy>	do you remember, people complained like that when 7.04 was released? As I said, it worked almost perfectly for me, but if people had problems also back then, then I'll upgrade. If 7.04 is known as a better release than it's followers, then I'll stick with it.
[none]	[00:35]	<ronartos>	how to know if ubuntu 8.04 detects my video card correctly?
[none]	[00:35]	<Wo0dy>	guess that the solution is to just fetch a live cd and see how that works for me..

[none]	[00:35]	<mophead>	userx86: this is the support channel.  if you need help withi something, please feel free to ask.  If not, just wait around for someone to ask a question you can help them with
[none]	[00:36]	<Abd>	i guess i'de better backup all my data and make a full install instead of the upgrade and see if hardy detects it
[none]	[00:36]	<happy_tux>	it says 8.04
[none]	[00:36]	<ronartos>	seems that xorg.conf shows diffrently
[none]	[00:36]	<t0dz>	uhm...

[none]	[00:36]	<chcampb>	pelo: that second page i hadnt seen, the first i did... it mentioned /etc/samba/smb.conf - i checked that, and there are no passwords in that location.... it does, however, mention the general passwd program - i tried that program, man'd it, and it does not have any flags that will allow me to view/edit the samba password as opposed to the unix password.... and now im back to zero

[none]	[00:37]	<Pelo>	t0dz, ask in #xchat
[none]	[00:38]	<astro76>	Sergiu9: you can use the hardy alternate cd to upgrade... it doesn't matter how you installed gutsy
[none]	[00:38]	<mophead>	ronartos: you will get a better response if you say which card you are using and what you are running
[none]	[00:38]	<dan__>	and update manager isnt good for release updates

[none]	[00:38]	<bsrat>	as in LTS..
[none]	[00:38]	<Pelo>	bsrat, means that hardy is gonna get 3 years of support , because it is a LTS ,   the others only get 18 months,   for patches and security fixes
[none]	[00:38]	<bsrat>	ah ok
[positive]	[00:38]	<teamcobra>	Abd: they're 2 conflicts in the b43 driver in 2.6.24..... I know for certain they fixed it in the new kernel, as I have the bcm4311rev02... been following this issue for a while ;)
[none]	[00:38]	<Starnestommy>	t0dz: /set irc_user_name new-ident
[none]	[00:38]	<Shpook>	Oh no, I've got more problems. I had a failed upgrade last night due to a lost wireless connection(I believe). Now today when I boot up my laptop, it tells me that there is a file system problem on sda1, and forces fsck. The fsck fails, mounts the root files system in read-only, and loads a maintenance shell. Thing is, I never had anything mounted as sda. sda is reserved for USB devices and such, correct?
[none]	[00:38]	<josh04>	illDecree: Can't help, sorry.
[none]	[00:39]	<joetheodd>	Are the repositories still bogged down?

[none]	[00:39]	<andril>	my upgrade went ok so far - but my sourcelist still has some Gutsy items - and I can change the cd to Heron - any help?
[positive]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	joetheodd, expect it for one week at lest
[none]	[00:39]	<cod3rz>	.
[none]	[00:39]	<seamus7>	t0dz just go into System/Administration/UsersandGroups to change your username
[none]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	least
[none]	[00:39]	<josh04>	Shpook: sda can also be SATA drives
[none]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	lol
[none]	[00:39]	<amenado>	Shpook-> nope
[none]	[00:39]	<userx86>	sphook my hard drive partitions are listed as /dev/sda
[none]	[00:39]	<illDecree>	josh04: you dont think it will work?
[none]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	i will tape all in 1
[positive]	[00:39]	<t0dz>	wait a momento :P
[none]	[00:39]	<mophead>	ronartos: I can't help, but ask again with all the info
[none]	[00:39]	<MrRoboto>	Is Pulseaudio installed by default in Hardy?
[negative]	[00:39]	<joetheodd>	Pelo :(. I agree with whoever said releases shouldn't hit the repositories until torrents have been going for a week or so.
[none]	[00:39]	<Starnestommy>	MrRoboto: I think so
[none]	[00:39]	<Pelo>	andril, just uncheck it in the software sources , in the admin menu
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	illDecree: No, i just don't know how to make it work :P Never used an S3 card
[none]	[00:40]	<MrRoboto>	Starnestommy:  Well I can't see it
[none]	[00:40]	<Shpook>	josh04, amenado, userx86: so, you're telling me this is bad news then?
[none]	[00:40]	<Abd>	teamcobra so I guess the problem sis really on my laptop. I'll make a fresh install of hardy, maybe the problems get solved
[none]	[00:40]	<Jack_Sparrow>	joetheodd, agreed
[none]	[00:40]	<otarid>	Pelo: reconfiguring xserver didn't work (just asked me about keyboard and mouse)
[none]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	joetheodd, well at least 24 hrs but tehre are still a lot of ppl that will try and upgrade online
[none]	[00:40]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: ya i have both
[positive]	[00:40]	<ronartos>	mophead: It's not very specific to my video card.. but how xorg.conf now display settings
[none]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	otarid, try the binari driver then
[none]	[00:40]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm not sure what's causing it
[none]	[00:40]	<andril>	Pelo: i did but there seemd to be less Heron compared to Gutsy
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	Shpook: Not necessarily. It might just be a SATA drive :P
[none]	[00:40]	<ronartos>	is there anyway I can check which card ubuntu 8.04 detected?
[none]	[00:40]	<userx86>	sphook i barely understand the nature of your problem, i just know that sda isn't necessarily removable storage
[none]	[00:40]	<Pelo>	otarid,  did you restart X after you reconfigured ?
[none]	[00:40]	<amenado>	Shpook-> all am saying is sda does not get tied to USB devices
[none]	[00:40]	<d4t4min32>	can someone help me with connetion issues, i have my cat /var/log/syslog | grep NetworkManager >
[positive]	[00:40]	<josh04>	otarid: you don't have an intel 965 do you?
[none]	[00:40]	<otarid>	no
[none]	[00:41]	<otarid>	let me try that
[positive]	[00:41]	<teamcobra>	abd: no
[none]	[00:41]	<joetheodd>	Pelo, the thing is, I'm still on the old one and I just want to install Azureus. I can't even download headers without timing out.
[none]	[00:41]	<alienzero>	anybody know how to make the alt+tab behavior revert to the old style (it shows all windows at once)?
[positive]	[00:41]	<teamcobra>	Abd: the problem _won't_ get solved
[none]	[00:41]	<Pelo>	andril, how did you upgrade anyway ?
[positive]	[00:41]	<bsrat>	can i add a 500Gb sata as primary and boot from that, and have an option to boot from current xp install on secondary sata which is 300Gb?

[none]	[00:48]	<cegopaiva>	hi everyone
[none]	[00:48]	<mneptok>	mariorz: yes. and i also know what the distro team recommends. and that's apt-get.
[none]	[00:48]	<d4t4min32>	nomasteryoda: did you see anythign that stuck out as being an issue
[none]	[00:48]	<Darkside>	thing is, its picking up the battery
[none]	[00:48]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, there is soemonee else with a nick close to yours we get confused, if you are told battery stuff ignore it

[none]	[00:48]	<doug2266778822>	would using someone elses codec files ruin my comp? if we both have same distro.
[none]	[00:48]	<mneptok>	mariorz: and so does apt-get
[none]	[00:48]	<nomasteryoda>	d4t4min32, then its defintely the wpa supplicant causing the issue... might want to seek out wicd ... i would google it ... what i use, but it can have issues with compiz... or so i'm told
[none]	[00:48]	<r557>	anyone here use a freedns such as dyndns or another?
[none]	[00:48]	<Darknezz>	Pelo lol ok

[none]	[00:59]	<backlash>	im looking around in network settings
[none]	[00:59]	<NetEcho>	ah so the issues are probably mirror issues
[none]	[00:59]	<carl>	NetEcho: there would be possible issues upgrading any OS
[none]	[00:59]	<astro76>	WhoNeedszzz: usually a few days
[none]	[00:59]	<gravemind>	"hey, I'm using the alternate cd on an amd 64 system, and for some reason, the ""DIstribution Upgrade"" application hangs on the first step. What is up?"

[none]	[01:00]	<NetEcho>	carl so the issues are probably people not changing the apt mirrors?

[none]	[01:01]	<carl>	NetEcho: no prob when you stick in the alternate cd you get a popup with an upgrade button
[none]	[01:01]	<happy_tux>	then kernel seems to load up

[none]	[01:02]	<WhoNeedszzz>	Gun_Smoke: and how much stuff do u have?
[none]	[01:02]	<NetEcho>	carl chances are I'll do a complete fresh install since I don't have any important files under 7.10
[none]	[01:02]	<Makgyver>	I cannot for the life of me get the live CD to boot, I keep getting dropped into initfs

[none]	[02:27]	<Pelo>	bagelong, ok it is likely that there is not linux driver for your card,  so you will have to use the windows driver with ndiswrapper,   that,s mentionned in the wifi docs

[none]	[02:48]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm confused
[none]	[02:48]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: making a separate partition for /home is a good idea, but I would choose ext3 if I were you
[positive]	[02:48]	<Assid>	gravemind: oh i had that issue yday.. was converting a guy to TRY ubuntu
[none]	[02:48]	<Pelo>	bjb1959, what do yo want to know ?

[none]	[02:49]	<josh04>	bagelong: Just try the apt-get command and if it's already installed it'll just say
[none]	[02:49]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, but you don't have to worry about that as you're not upgrading
[none]	[02:49]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  ok
[positive]	[02:49]	<Assid>	gravemind: finally refused to resize the partition.. and hes like screw it.. and left it on vista
[none]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	doug_, what is the actual problem ?
[positive]	[02:49]	<gravemind>	Assid: heh, wow
[positive]	[02:49]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: so when i make a new i'l choose ext3?
[none]	[02:49]	<biabia>	bazant that last one is an external. all three drives mount fine if i select the previous kernel but when i select the new one i get an error saying i need to update the driver sd and sr
[none]	[02:49]	<ffm_>	Which is better in a mirror, latency or bandwidth?
[positive]	[02:49]	<Assid>	gravemind: yeah.. it ran for over an hour and did NOTHING
[none]	[02:49]	<bazhang>	biabia: are you able to check their new listings and adjust fstab accordingly? able to mount them manually?
[none]	[02:49]	<doug_>	a black screen ... can get to ttys ok

[none]	[02:49]	<bjb1959>	Pelo I just upgraded to Hardy and I can't logoff/shutdown/reboot without using the ctrl+alt+backspace. the logoff icon just makes desktop clear but nothing else any ideas?
[none]	[02:49]	<Pelo>	bjb1959, check i menu > syusetm > admin > users check your user's permission  to shutdown
[positive]	[02:49]	<nucco>	ffm_: both :) higher bandwidth, lower latency is better
[none]	[02:49]	<bagelong>	josh04:says I am good to go aready.
[none]	[02:49]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes. now right now, are you running on the live cd, or are you installed already?
[none]	[02:50]	<AlienX>	ffm_, that's kind of a silly question as both factors are important
[positive]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: then i'l have 2 filesystems whit ext3
[none]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	AlienX, I realize that.
[none]	[02:50]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: wrong link?

[none]	[02:50]	<josh04>	bagelong: type ndiswrapper -l, it shoul say no drivers isntalled
[none]	[02:50]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: yes, however you also need a swap partition
[none]	[02:50]	<kbrooks>	how do i show the time directly on my desktop?
[none]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	doug_, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg from the recovery mode
[none]	[02:50]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: of about 1 gb in size
[none]	[02:50]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: Is there a wlan0 in iwconfig?
[none]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	AlienX, I mean is a mirror with higher latency but higher bandwith better than a close mirror with less bandwith?
[none]	[02:50]	<bazhang>	ffm_: bandwidth but kinda offtopic here
[none]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	kbrooks, gdesklets, or screenlets
[none]	[02:50]	<bjb1959>	Pelo Oh that's right, I forgot about making sure permissions are set right after upgrade. thanks I'll try that first
[none]	[02:50]	<doug_>	thanks ... I'll try it
[none]	[02:50]	<Pelo>	kbrooks, or conky or gtkrll
[positive]	[02:50]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: oky. but how will thath efekt my system whit 2 ext3 systems?
[none]	[02:50]	<ffm_>	bazhang, Not really, this is about ubuntu repo mirrors.
[none]	[02:50]	<LainIwakura>	Hello.. I installed this font and it shows up in xfontsel but not in any drop-down fonts menu. How do I actually use the font? Thanks for any help.
[none]	[02:50]	<AlienX>	ffm_, neither is an indication of what download speeds you'll actually get
[none]	[02:50]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  igot this E: Couldn't find package envyng
[none]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	Alright, downloading.
[none]	[02:51]	<evilbug>	Pelo- i completely re-installed gutsy and installed all the updates for it,and now when i log in it gets stuck on the light brown screen.
[none]	[02:51]	<kbrooks>	Pelo, ty
[none]	[02:51]	<biabia>	bazhang: no im not sure how to check the new listings, but i could try to mount them manually although im not precisely sure how to do that either. i had help with it before but i saved the instruction i recieved
[none]	[02:51]	<seriouslycgi>	anyone help me with samba configuration its kinda dead in the samba channel?
[none]	[02:51]	<bazhang>	ffm_: you creating one?
[positive]	[02:51]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i wont loose all the files i have now?
[none]	[02:51]	<nucco>	ffm_: probably... unless your pipe is smaller than the lower mirror, and you think it won't be crowded
[none]	[02:51]	<bagelong>	josh04:  in the terminal?  Nothing happended
[none]	[02:51]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, cd to the directory where you downloaded envy
[none]	[02:51]	<Darknezz>	Starnestommy: I keep getting this error configure: error: *** GTK+ >= 1.2.2 not installed - please install first ***
[none]	[02:51]	<Darknezz>	 (HAHAHA sorry)
[none]	[02:51]	<ffm_>	bazhang, No.
[positive]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	evilbug- install hardy :)
[none]	[02:51]	<cygoku_>	How are the repositories feeling right now ?!?!
[none]	[02:51]	<cardstroker>	rkvirani, what ya got?
[none]	[02:51]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: it doesn't make a difference in how your system will run, it's just a little bit safer to have /home on a separate partition. but you don't really have to
[none]	[02:51]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, though i *think* ubuntu has some tool that'll let you just click on the package and it'll install for you
[positive]	[02:51]	<nucco>	ffm_: or use bittorrent and forget about bandwidth issues :)
[none]	[02:51]	<Starnestommy>	Darknezz: I'm stuck.  I can't figure out why that keeps failing
[none]	[02:51]	<evilbug>	osxdude- that didn't work,the install gave me crap :|
[none]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	cygoku_, I think they are good
[none]	[02:51]	<ffm_>	nucco, that won't work for APT, will it?
[none]	[02:51]	<josh04>	bagelong: Hold on while I find you a link
[none]	[02:51]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: the reason you can't resize your existing partition is because you're running on it
[none]	[02:51]	<bazhang>	ffm_: what is the exact nature of your issue then? just curious/chat or have actual issues creating a mirror
[none]	[02:51]	<osxdude>	evilbug- what kind of crap?
[none]	[02:52]	<Pelo>	Darknezz, install the related -dev package , look in synaptic
[none]	[02:52]	<Wolf23>	AlienX:  i dont download the envy, coz i dont know where is the download package
[none]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: if you boot up from the live cd, you will be able to resize it
[positive]	[02:52]	<nucco>	ffm_: :p silly me :p
[none]	[02:52]	<ffm_>	bazhang, I'm choosing a mirror for my systems.
[none]	[02:52]	<Pelo>	ok I'M going on a brake, later folks
[none]	[02:52]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it's on the page.
[none]	[02:52]	<cygoku_>	Cool.
[none]	[02:52]	<ffm_>	nucco, I bittorrent the ISOs of course...
[none]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: maybe that's what you should do, if you don't want 2 partitions
[none]	[02:52]	<nucco>	ffm_: latency generally won't affect the speed of the download
[none]	[02:52]	<AlienX>	Wolf23, it'll be something like envyng.deb or something
[none]	[02:52]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i did but it still dont work
[positive]	[02:52]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: i want to have 2 partisjons
[none]	[02:52]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, 1 sec,,
[none]	[02:52]	<Darknezz>	Pelo: i almost installed all the files
[positive]	[02:52]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: good :)
[positive]	[02:52]	<trippingmonke1>	does anyone here have any experience with the NVIDIA 169.12 driver in hardy?
[positive]	[02:52]	<mayakuza>	gravemind: but i don't wanna lose the files i already have in /home
[none]	[02:52]	<josh04>	bagelong: Can you type lspci and copy me the line referring to Broadcom?
[none]	[02:53]	<bazhang>	ffm_: best to hold off on choosing; the ones you choose now may not be the best because of the recent release of hardy
[none]	[02:53]	<josh04>	SeaPhor: thanks
[none]	[02:53]	<gravemind>	mayakuza: ok, we will be careful, and not lose them

[none]	[03:20]	<jstritar>	ffm_: they shouldn't pretend like you can upgrade
[none]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Well, it can be used by malicious black-hat hackers.
[none]	[03:20]	<Starnestommy>	xyzpaw: it's usually used for remote administration of servers

[none]	[03:20]	<slashzul>	how do you add gnome desktop on a ubuntu server install? gdm?
[none]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	"jstritar, When you install ""community supported software"" it isn't supported by canonical."

[none]	[03:20]	<ffm_>	mikebot, Yes.
[none]	[03:20]	<nucco>	MewRS: my verdict though, is that the drive is history. and mkfs on the entire drive won't work either.
[none]	[03:20]	<osxdude>	!proxy
[negative]	[03:20]	<ubotu>	Many Ubuntu IRC channels prohibit access from !proxies such as !TOR and web (Java, etc) gateways due to a high level of abuse. You can however obtain a hostmask cloak: see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#cloaks
[none]	[03:20]	<jstritar>	ffm_: that doesn't mean ubuntu should upgrade without warning you it might break your entire system
[none]	[03:21]	<lewench>	artenius, ITS ON!
[none]	[03:21]	<xyzpaw>	how do you use ssh to control rtorrent?
[none]	[03:21]	<MewRS>	nucco: Kingston R.I.P.
[none]	[03:21]	<w30>	xyzpaw: ssh is a secure version of telnet that can't be intercepted to get keystrokes for login names and passwords (greatly simplified)
[none]	[03:21]	<slashzul>	does GDM install add desktop to a server instsall?
[none]	[03:21]	<xrc>	you don't use ssh to control torrent
[none]	[03:21]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: i'm pretty sure there are many tutorials out there on the internets. i never used rtorrent myself
[none]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	jstritar, Uh, that's implicit in any upgrade. You should always back up data, but especially with system updates.
[none]	[03:21]	<Pelo>	Nutzebahn,  that's where i look when I want software,  you can try google , Ihave no more suggestion but I've seen it mentioned on digg I think ,
[none]	[03:21]	<osxdude>	Lol, I have the same EXACT type of Kingston memory in the family computer right now
[none]	[03:21]	<jstritar>	ffm_: do you know of way of trying to resolve upgrade issues?
[positive]	[03:21]	<MewRS>	nucco: no way to try to write a disklabel from term? :P
[none]	[03:21]	<ffm_>	xyzpaw, Basically, it is easier for malicious people to hack into you if you use telnet.
[none]	[03:21]	<josh04>	xyzpaw: You ssh in, run screen, open rtorrent, set it up, detach from screen and log out of ssh
[none]	[03:21]	<leo_rockw>	xyzpaw: but rtorrent is not anonymous
[none]	[03:22]	<totocool>	hi all I`ve just installed KDE 4 but the panew went away and don`t know how to start it

[none]	[03:22]	<josh04>	MewRS: I presume parted can do it, but I don;t know how
[none]	[03:22]	<Pelo>	totocool, ask in #kubuntu or #kde

[none]	[03:58]	<SeaPhor>	josh04, i followed this once, maybe i'll try again
[none]	[03:58]	<Starnestommy>	thinkingfrog: they can usually be compiled as a module then loaded into the kernel without compiling it into the kernel

[none]	[05:28]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I suppose it depends on the exact definition of 'service', these scripts get run to start different things at init time.
[none]	[05:28]	<Drezard>	in regards to wireless connections...
[none]	[05:28]	<Nikonlappy>	you can use root .. there isnt a big problem with it.. but its frowned upon with this OS

[none]	[05:28]	<cvd-pr>	chicobo329,  the update manager  never ask you to do a partial-upgrade?

[none]	[05:30]	<bazhang>	shally87: best to get a desktop and then install LAMP on top--especially as you are new to this; alternately you could install ubuntu-desktop to that (sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop) and work from there --if you do not wish to reinstall
[none]	[05:30]	<Shadow420>	how can I fix my login screen it's too big for my monitor?

[none]	[05:30]	<neil_d>	jamiejackson: I would sugjest you put your command in that rc.local file, maybe just something that wont cause trouble to start with.  like load a module you don't need as a test.

[none]	[06:56]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Koheleth: xfce is just meant to be lighter than nautilus, whats good about it depends on the user and how much resources they can use
[none]	[06:56]	<Koheleth>	I see
[none]	[06:56]	<androver>	sam, just a guess, CPU scaling probably isn't working in ubuntu
[none]	[06:56]	<Koheleth>	Baby_Shambl3s, arnt you meant to be in jail?
[none]	[06:56]	<sam__>	so does that mean my CPU is doing too much work?

[none]	[06:57]	<androver>	kind of, yeah.  lemme find you a reference that tells you how to fix it.
[none]	[06:57]	<dmsuperman>	Alright, I'm now backing up my full partition, excluding any extra data (such as /proc, /media, etc.) where are all the main places ubuntu uses for extra data that I can delete? For example, before backing up windows I would flush the temporary internet files, and the prefetch, to save room

[none]	[06:58]	<unop>	Claan22, you probably need to run ./configure first -- but do read the INSTALL/README file first, it varies from package to package

[none]	[07:00]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	"Claan22: it dont work like that you have to go into the directory using cli (command line) so it would be cd /""than directory path > once inside the director make wait for it to make and than sudo make install (make sure you have buil-essential installed)"

[none]	[07:00]	<gooody>	is there any way to edit icon settings in ubuntu gutsy?
[none]	[07:00]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: you should be able to get at the D drive ehhh look in
[none]	[07:00]	<androver>	no prob
[none]	[07:00]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Err well is drive D a second partition on the first physical disk - or is it its own physical disk
[none]	[07:00]	<cool>	gooody, System>Preferences>Appearance
[none]	[07:00]	<seamus7>	gooody you can install different icon sets in Appearances ... you change individual icons by right-clicking an app and choosing properties
[none]	[07:01]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: it is a second partition on my main disk. I was able to access D with 7, but with Hardy, I don't see it.
[none]	[07:01]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: like unop said you might have to run ./configure first than make, you can also try make check just incase to see if you have all dependencies
[none]	[07:01]	<sam__>	weird, i cant open CPU frequency scaling monitor in my taskbar
[none]	[07:01]	<sam__>	how can i find it
[none]	[07:01]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: Is it NTFS or FAT32 ?
[none]	[07:01]	<OldSocks>	Cpudan80: NTFS logical
[none]	[07:01]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: brb - something is wrong with my client - gotta reboot it
[none]	[07:01]	<unop>	Claan22, it's always recommended you read the INSTALL/README files before making assumptions and running ./configure or make
[none]	[07:01]	<led3234>	how do i install the propietery (sp?) drivers?
[none]	[07:01]	<cool>	sam__, you installed it?
[none]	[07:01]	<Claan22>	how do I use ./configure?  make is giving me 'error 2', so I figure that's the problem
[none]	[07:01]	<androver>	"sam__: it doesn't show up when you right-click on the taskbar and say ""add to panel""?"

[none]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	Ok well that was odd
[none]	[07:02]	<Claan22>	unop:  I'm following instructions on the internet, they just tell me to make it
[negative]	[07:02]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently
[none]	[07:02]	<sam__>	add new item?

[none]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	anyway
[none]	[07:02]	<androver>	"it's called ""add to panel"" on mine, I'm on hardy."
[none]	[07:02]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: So NTFS partition... ok.. so you should be able to hit it at /media/sdb I think
[none]	[07:02]	<seamus7>	Any strong reason to do a fresh install rather than an upgrade?
[none]	[07:02]	<OldSocks>	Baby_Shambl3s: yea I know that, but I can't access my D drive, even though its called something else.
[none]	[07:02]	<unop>	Claan22, trust the instructions in the INSTALL file over anything else - they are probably more authoritative than anything else

[none]	[07:03]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	Claan22: first thing you need to do is go into the folder and check Readme file and Install file if it is provided or go to the site and check documentations to see which commands you need, have you even got a compiler?
[none]	[07:03]	<cool>	gooody, you can find more eye candy on gnome-look.org
[none]	[07:03]	<Cpudan80>	OldSocks: It might not be automatically mounted, if that's the case - come back and we can walk through it
[none]	[07:03]	<seamus7>	gooody how would you like your icons to appear?
[none]	[07:03]	<Koheleth>	xfce programs hide behind the tool bar, anyway to make it rest at the top of the tool bar like in a mac
[none]	[07:03]	<OldSocks>	cpudan80: alright thanks. I'll reboot now.
[none]	[07:04]	<gooody>	seamus7: just like pdf licons like in windows
[none]	[07:04]	<sam__>	when i right click on my panel i dont get those options
[positive]	[07:04]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: in windows you wont be able to access d:\ as it is in linux partition m$ windows wont read it but ubuntu will read windows and other partitions
[none]	[07:04]	<sam__>	is it because im using Xubuntu?
[none]	[07:04]	<androver>	sam: yup, that's it.
[positive]	[07:04]	<Claan22>	baby_shambl3s: there's a readme, but it doesn't explain installation at all.  there's no install file.  I don't know if I have a compiler.  I'm following instructions here: http://rtl-wifi.sourceforge.net/wiki/Installing which I guess it the website
[none]	[07:04]	<gooody>	seamus7: the default setting consumes a lot of space on my desktop
[none]	[07:04]	<oddalot>	"w00t, i think it's compiling....IT""S ALIVE"
[none]	[07:04]	<androver>	you'll have to do CPU scaling some other way.
[none]	[07:05]	<seamus7>	gooody you don't want the icons to preview their content ... you just want the pdf symbol to appear as the icon?
[none]	[07:05]	<Daniel15>	"gooody, you just want normal icons to appear, and not the preview? Go to a folder and click Edit ->Preferences, change the ""Show thumbnails"" item on the Preview tab."
[none]	[07:05]	<gooody>	seamus7: yes
[none]	[07:05]	<koomber1664>	um, how do I get my waste bin back on a panel?

[none]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	koomber right click, add to panel
[none]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	i had to restart once
[none]	[07:06]	<oddalot>	maybe it's a bug

[negative]	[07:08]	<Baby_Shambl3s>	OldSocks: your D drive is where ubuntu is? thats claled filesystem now and D:\ is only in winows ubutnu works differently /lib/modules/`uname -r` -name ieee80211

[none]	[09:29]	<ferris_>	rob later
[none]	[09:29]	<rothchild>	it's been a while since I played with a broadcom I think you need ndiswrapper?
[none]	[09:29]	<Dr_willis>	GT,  Hmm.. I have heard of issues with the 6200 - Not sure why that is. with DVI the thing 'should' get the monitor settings right
[none]	[09:29]	<earthcreed>	nick- Try Maxima.

[none]	[09:29]	<toplok>	what a mess I have with 8.04. I guess I may need to reinstall from zero... the upgrade was terrible
[none]	[09:29]	<rothchild>	not ndiswapper?
[none]	[09:29]	<earthcreed>	nick- If you know python and can wrap your head around it you might want to try sage.
[none]	[09:30]	<jube>	astro76, thank you so much. I found it in the gconf-editor under apps and was able to clear the film setting so it doesn't default to the wrong film name

[positive]	[09:30]	<androver>	earthcreed: they switched to pulseaudio in 8.04.  Wine, at least, doesn't have a pulseaudio driver working yet so they do some compatibility stuff with OSS.  Not that that helps :)

[none]	[10:29]	<MttJocy>	You know, I wonder why, especially when there is a new distribution update that puts a lot of pressure on the update servers (or it seams to be, my computers online update tool is downloading them now) have they ever considered making it so that the online distribution upgrade tool has the option to fetch the distribution update via torrent rather than hitting the update servers directly, I am sure given the option quite a few users would choose it and
[none]	[10:29]	<MttJocy>	it could help reduce the peak load the update servers get on release day, or is there some reason this is technically not possible?

[none]	[10:34]	<linux__alien>	is there a wor around for this?
[none]	[10:35]	<MttJocy>	timandtom, Regards your wireless card no longer being detected after the distribution upgrade, perhaps you should submit a bug report with the details of your card etc, check nobody else has already posted one though.
[none]	[10:35]	<lartza_>	could someone write me script to delete all files under 35kt from a folder?
[positive]	[10:35]	<timandtom>	amerio: I've been asking in here for a while too, no one seems to have any idea :( I'm thinking about just going back to 7.10 for a bit, especially if it turns out to be  Ubuntu specifically, not just the card not working at all(Haven't tried on XP yet)
[none]	[10:35]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, i have the same card, only the non-mobile version, and the restricted drivers manager should handle them fine
[none]	[10:35]	<astro76>	lartza_: that should be one find command

[none]	[10:35]	<elmargol>	Someone knows how I can see if an application uses XV?
[none]	[10:35]	<Exteris>	but linux__alien you should pastebin the contents of: /var/log/Xorg.0.log

[none]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, currently i am using X without xorg.conf i ve delete the file
[none]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, is it possible to paste it now ? or should i enable it again and paste it?
[none]	[10:36]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, you should have renamed it
[positive]	[10:36]	<timandtom>	Well, I'm out for the night. I'll try again tomorrow if it works in WinXP... Or just reinstall 7.10 if not. Farewell.
[none]	[10:36]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, uhm no you need the log with the errors in it
[none]	[10:36]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, i still have a backup though

[none]	[10:37]	<timandtom>	amerio: Ah, that sucks. Everything worked perfectly right out of the box for me with 7.10. It was really a great way to get introduced to Linux.
[none]	[10:37]	<eeboy>	Dr_willis, when a user logs in is what I am after
[none]	[10:37]	<chivaknievel>	this is such a mess, if upgrading is going to cause so many problems to so many people, what is the point of the every 6 month upgrade?
[none]	[10:37]	<linux__alien>	Exteris, so should i rename the file and again try logging into X and then copy the xorg.log and paste it?
[none]	[10:37]	<MttJocy>	timandtom, To be honest not sure how to help you there, presumably something in the upgrade has broken the support for that card I guess, maybe someone else who has your card who is cleverer than me might figure out a workaround till it is fixed with some luck (either that or it gets fixed soon)
[none]	[10:37]	<Exteris>	linux__alien, restore the backup, restart the xserver, it fails, then copy the log to another file and paste it
[none]	[10:37]	<linux__alien>	done will do it now

[none]	[10:43]	<tcpdumpgod>	alienseer23-eee it probably screwed your xorg.conf up.

I had the same trouble with 7.10 but was hoping that 8.04 would fix the problem. When I click on the volume control I get the following error: The volume control did not find any elements and/or devices to control. This means either that you don't have the right GStreamer plugins installed, or that...
[none]	[12:14]	<gavinreddrop>	...you don't have a sound card configured.                After that error is displayed I get this error when I click on it: No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.     I have searched though the forums with no avail and now I am here....  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated..
[none]	[12:14]	<LebLinux>	zeno: no it doesn't do it ... still kept back
[none]	[12:14]	<sofiankr1>	zeno: there's just one problem, the wireless thing on my computer is not lighted up...

[none]	[12:15]	<dreamcoder>	ubuntu seems more refined
[none]	[12:15]	<zeno>	sofiankr1: not sure, maybe it just lights up when you are connected?
[none]	[12:16]	<crashanddie>	dreamcoder, if you need help finding out which one to use, go to #gnome and #kde and ask them why you should use it
[none]	[12:16]	<livingdaylight>	dreamcoder, its a tough choice i agree
[none]	[12:16]	<dreamcoder>	ok
[none]	[12:16]	<sofiankr1>	dreamcoder: I tried Kubuntu, really did not like it
[none]	[12:16]	<koudelka>	livingdaylight, no, but if you insert cd's or something you change the preferred application menu. but for opening a file with a special program you rightclick and go to preferences
[none]	[12:16]	<silentlamb>	i prefer gnome
[none]	[12:16]	<sofiankr1>	zeno: no, it used to light up at all times
[none]	[12:16]	<livingdaylight>	koudelka, gotcha
[none]	[12:16]	<silentlamb>	its lightweight compared to kde
[none]	[12:16]	<dreamcoder>	i like the refinement of gnome but like the fuctionaility or kde

[none]	[12:52]	<errpast>	grrr, that's the link I found yesterday. BUT....the link isn't working today. I didn't succeed getting Flash with 8.04, but I didn't try. I was just researching a few things that didn't work, and was going to try them all today
[none]	[12:52]	<joemac>	Good?
[none]	[12:52]	<oholiks>	joneskoo: used to be atleast

[none]	[12:52]	<samalex>	anyone familiar with netatalk?  I'm trying to copy data from OSX to Ubuntu Server 8.04, but Netatalk is passing the free space of the user's home directory and not the HD mounted within.
[none]	[12:53]	<oholiks>	joneskoo: pin unstable debootstrap and use that one?
[none]	[12:53]	<MttJocy>	Okay I'm lost, unless there is something else a hard drive can show up as, seams it is not detecting it.
[none]	[12:53]	<joneskoo>	oholiks: perhaps. I haven't did pinning so I'll just try the template first
[none]	[12:53]	<samalex>	... the /home partition only has 5 gigs of free space but I've mounted a 300 gig HD within my home directory to backup stuff to.  OSX shows only 5 gigs free so when I try to copy stuff into this 300 gig mounted drive, says not enough space
[none]	[12:53]	<crashanddie>	joemac, I think you should try to get a CD/DVD and try again, because your install seems pretty damaged

[none]	[12:59]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Such as?
[none]	[13:00]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, first of all, we would need to take a few choices, like do we make one big package with everything in it for the upgrade, or one .torrent per package ?
[none]	[13:00]	<daedra>	paste!|goth
[none]	[13:00]	<daedra>	oops
[none]	[13:00]	<g0th>	hmm and I can't set the background anymore somehow
[none]	[13:00]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, both are good, because one is better for the server, but the other is better for maintainability
[none]	[13:00]	<daedra>	!paste|g0th

[none]	[13:01]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, then of course, it would mean that the devs need to push yet another package, and pushing a release on bittorrent is way harder than just working behind the projectors and syncing HTTP/FTP mirrors
[negative]	[13:01]	<g0th>	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64505/
[none]	[13:01]	<g0th>	ubotu: that's the whole output
[none]	[13:01]	<g0th>	daedra sorry
[none]	[13:02]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's cheaper, but it's harder, and we've seen it during the last couple days, even the tracker got downed by the amount of users
[none]	[13:02]	<Ceo1>	hey
[none]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, imagine what it would be if everyone did the same ? Also, bittorrent doesn't allow you to use local mirrors, so those who don't care would be using one download for each computer, instead of setting up a local mirror and downloading it once
[none]	[13:03]	<Ceo1>	brakkvatn
[none]	[13:03]	<Ceo1>	r u there?
[none]	[13:03]	<g0th>	how do I change my background image?
[none]	[13:03]	<joomla_user>	g0th, what are you building ?
[none]	[13:03]	<m0ns00n>	Anyone knows why eclipse can't connect to the net in hardy?

[none]	[13:03]	<g0th>	I don't know why xen is mentioned
[none]	[13:03]	<m0ns00n>	Not installed from packages..
[none]	[13:03]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, One .torrent per package probably would not really be the best idea to be fair, torrent tends to not work as efficiently with many small files, however if you put it in one big torrent it would work better, and it is still possible to selectively download the .debs inside it (Azureus has the option I think all Bit Torrent clients do)
[none]	[13:03]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, it's a nice idea, but it's pretty much flawed from the start, and we'd need to hack it big time before we could do something with it
[none]	[13:04]	<lamothe>	beardos: And there you are!
[none]	[13:04]	<g0th>	joomla_user: hmm I don't get anything if I right click

[none]	[13:06]	<silentlamb>	errpast so wat do u do wit ur linux box
[none]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I think there's something else that worries them, we've all seen how updates get distributed on WoW, or any other update manager that uses bittorrent
[none]	[13:06]	<MttJocy>	crashanddie, Talking about local mirrors, I wish that squid didn't decide not to cache .debs if it had cached them would save having to download them all again for the other machine :|
[none]	[13:06]	<gfather>	guys anyone here has a vpn for god sake ?? ??
[positive]	[13:06]	<Yapsey>	joeamined: there's an alternate install CD
[none]	[13:06]	<silentlamb>	want to learn perl and python very important in security
[positive]	[13:06]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, like I said, it could be an awesome idea, but it really needs some work, I might write an essay about it or something ;)
[none]	[13:07]	<joeamined>	yapsey: is it possible from the live cd ?
[none]	[13:07]	<Yapsey>	don't know. maybe the second option in the booting menu?
[positive]	[13:07]	<crashanddie>	MttJocy, I have a local mirror on my home network, I've uploaded more than 80Gig on release day ;)

[none]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	first thing
[none]	[13:08]	<Yapsey>	jdolan: just using a network source?
[none]	[13:08]	<gavin__>	the strange thing is that it works perfectly on 8.10
[none]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	ssh-agent seems not to work
[none]	[13:08]	<jdolan>	Yapsey, sure, how do i tell it to do that?
[none]	[13:08]	<jdolan>	just remove the CD from my sources list?
[none]	[13:08]	<b33r_>	does anyone know where's iced tea java cache directory and how to change it?
[none]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	yeah how can install ubuntu on and empty system with a bad crcrive
[none]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	always get an error
[none]	[13:08]	<MttJocy>	(Unless there is some way to force it to cache them, but bit late now, already done the download on the one machine anyway, although if there was a way to force it would save wasted downloads when both computers have to download for the most part the same updates even with normal updates)
[positive]	[13:08]	<Yapsey>	jdolan: place a # in front of your CD is the easiest way I guess :)
[none]	[13:08]	<Oetzi>	Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
[none]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	is there any solution to that problem
[none]	[13:08]	<zyx386>	can every one tell me that?
[none]	[13:08]	<silentlamb>	seen the pendrive
[positive]	[13:09]	<jdolan>	Yapsey, hah, why didn't i think of that?  (just disabling the source), hehe :)

[none]	[13:09]	<joneskoo>	no hardy
[none]	[13:09]	<MttJocy>	Is that possible? to force squid to cache .debs instead of ignore them? (I assume the file names do change with each version of the package right)
[none]	[13:09]	<zyx386>	why is FF Work offline standard?

[none]	[13:37]	<GoodJob>	my system has the keyboard layout set to some other than the USA... in the system the behaviour is correct, but in the Login Window the keyboard layout is messed up (the USA layout is loaded)... how can i make my system's keyboard layout to be the same for the Login Window?

[none]	[13:37]	<idyllic>	silent: lol, okay. Can you change your xorg.conf. Driver from vesa to nvidia?
[none]	[13:37]	<GoodJob>	i have hardy
[none]	[13:38]	<jarle>	"dirtyrice: so the program started from the script is not ""GOD"""
[none]	[13:38]	<Wibble->	I've got a real problem with Hardy - my sound card just stopped working! It was working this morning and now doesn't.  No additional software was installed AFAIK.  Pulse audo appears to be running and hasn't put anything in syslog.
[none]	[13:38]	<idyllic>	silent: back up your xorg.conf first in case there is problem later
[none]	[13:38]	<mut80r>	chazco: kernel improvements I think. happens to me too. then it goes to the normal loading bar
[none]	[13:38]	<IntangibleLiquid>	how do I define Fn F9 to be the touchpad enabler/disabler?
[none]	[13:38]	<idyllic>	silent: you got nvidia-glx-new driver installed i suppose?
[none]	[13:38]	<adac>	i deleteted the old sources.list file and added the new for the upgrade to hardy sith only hardy sources...but still when I call apt-get update it shows me that it fetches gutsy repositories. What is the problem here?
[none]	[13:38]	<chazco>	mut80r - It doesnt do it on my desktop though... seems odd to have a slower bootup on a more powerful machine
[none]	[13:38]	<joeamined>	hi
[none]	[13:39]	<joeamined>	is it possible to install ubuntu desktop edition without launching gnome ?

[negative]	[13:39]	<g0th>	hmpf, not much help here :(

[none]	[13:39]	<rsk>	nope
[none]	[13:39]	<mut80r>	chazco: I don't exactly know what the sideways scrolling bar is there for. disabling the splash screen, all I see is a 10-second or so pause before it gets going.
[none]	[13:40]	<silent>	idyllic: i dont think so
[none]	[13:40]	<theone_>	joeamined, do you mean booting straight to a command line?
[none]	[13:40]	<joeamined>	theone: i mean installing ubuntu with command line
[none]	[13:40]	<silent>	idyllic: just installed this ubuntu and put xchat on it, nothing else
[none]	[13:40]	<chazco>	mut80r - Unsure what its for here also... on mine if i boot in recovery mode I see it pause over ACPI/SATA initalisation...
[none]	[13:40]	<joeamined>	because i don't have enough RAM (only 256), so i can't install with live cd booted
[positive]	[13:41]	<idyllic>	silent: System - Administration - Hardware Driver =D enable the restrictive driver
[none]	[13:41]	<dirtyrice>	then you must use alternate cd like the guy above said
[none]	[13:41]	<mut80r>	chazco: are you using a SATA drive ?
[none]	[13:41]	<joeamined>	ok thanks
[none]	[13:41]	<chazco>	mut80r - Yep... but my desktop is also which doesnt have this issue
[none]	[13:41]	<dirtyrice>	i had to use it when installing on a 550
[none]	[13:41]	<theone_>	joeamined, you should just pick the install without booitng to the live cd option
[none]	[13:41]	<daniel_hh>	lamothe: I allread restarted X and the computer
[positive]	[13:41]	<mut80r>	chazco: would be best not to mess with anything for now then until someone can tell us what it's there for. ;)

[none]	[14:36]	<mut80r>	johnmike: some routers won't activate port forwarding until you disable DHCP. annoying, I know.
[none]	[14:37]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: heh, so general connection issues, not specifically with ping... what actual type of connection to the internet does it have?
[positive]	[14:37]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: it passed the md5sum on my xp box
[none]	[14:37]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable, about 15 mbit down, 1.5 mbit up. usually no problems at all
[none]	[14:37]	<akt>	Both will provide latest apps and anyway both the same Linux kernel. using the same aptitude
[none]	[14:37]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: never mind the previous
[none]	[14:37]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: are there are boxen on the same connection you can check?
[none]	[14:37]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: straight to modem, no router (anymore). possible that it was hacked somehow?
[none]	[14:37]	<akt>	what's the difference?

[none]	[14:38]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: hmm well it's a bit difficult to say that's it definitively a problem with ubuntu
[none]	[14:38]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: I can go overthere which I will do even though it's a bit of a hassle.. what should I check for first, behind the thing?
[none]	[14:38]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: what's the Process Name u get ?
[none]	[14:38]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[none]	[14:39]	<mut80r>	johnmike: unless you know how to set a static IP and have the DNS addresses, DON'T disable DHCP.
[none]	[14:39]	<Jarwo>	sweety_girl
[none]	[14:39]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: if you can go over there and access the box, then you can do a lot of general connection tests
[none]	[14:39]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: Yes, you should have ~350MB of Ram to do the ive cd.
[none]	[14:39]	<Fritzel>	danbhfive, this is an interesting rts, from the first few minutes in the tutorial it seems like there isnt' much micro-management to worry about
[none]	[14:39]	<andycaass>	ubuntung-pinoy: i dont know process name, thats the thing...
[none]	[14:39]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: i just wanted to install it
[none]	[14:39]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  please, i need help :s ?
[none]	[14:40]	<Lieutenant>	tyler: the disk does work on my laptop, same specs, just a dell
[positive]	[14:40]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yeah, bit afraid they'll come out the same.. :-/ anything I should look at after concluding it's not connecting?
[none]	[14:40]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ha ha, no. I would look it all up first. How would I learn how to setup static IPs, figure out DNSs, and all that on Ubuntu?
[none]	[14:40]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: You should download the text-based alternate cd from the ubuntu site.
[none]	[14:40]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	andycaass: me neither.. but no Process Name in the SysMon that resembles the one u're looking for?
[none]	[14:40]	<MttJocy>	johnmike, Ah, well if you wait here a few minutes I'll be happy to talk to you see if I can come up with any ideas to help y ideas to help you but I just need to restart this computer first so will be gone a few minutes ok?

[none]	[14:40]	<ciro>	bebraw, i just installed awn and awn manager but there are no applets in the program
[none]	[14:40]	<mut80r>	johnmike: are you using network-manager? (the network icon in the top right corner)
[none]	[14:41]	<Daverocks>	"Nomikos_: well it seems unstable rather than ""not connecting""... i'd start up a packet sniffer on it and check what's going on..."
[none]	[14:41]	<MttJocy>	Okay, see you in a few minutes.
[none]	[14:41]	<jagggy>	what is the default JDK1.5 path  PLEASE?
[none]	[14:41]	<bebraw>	ciro, i suppose you have to get the plugins elsewhere
[none]	[14:41]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah
[none]	[14:41]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: yeah if it's ppp, check those logs
[none]	[14:41]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: good idea, I'll try that
[none]	[14:41]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: ppp?
[none]	[14:41]	<tyler>	Lieutenant: The RAM requirement are just what they say on the Ubuntu web site, and could very welll be the reason of your problem. i've gotten the live cd to run on a box with 128MB!!
[none]	[14:41]	<magnetron>	ciro: you have to drag something to the icon area, IIRC
[none]	[14:41]	<mut80r>	johnmike: right click nm-applet, click connection information. copy down IP address, default route, subnet mask, and DNS addresses.
[none]	[14:41]	<x0x>	ok how to install eBox?

[none]	[14:42]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: point-to-point... thought it might be the way it's going through the modem
[none]	[14:42]	<virus92ita>	my new problem: I just got Hardy, booted the first time, logged on. It said that some proprietary drivers were needed (ATI Accelerated Graphics Driver). I installed those drivers and a blinking icon told me to reboot my pc. Now I can't use ubuntu anymore, I always get a black screen before log on screen. Can someone help me?
[none]	[14:42]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: cable modem, broadband
[none]	[14:42]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: is the cable modem itself a network device or is it bridged?

[none]	[14:45]	<tyler>	Leiutneant: Idont know if they ship out the alternate cd, either.
[none]	[14:45]	<psych>	but when apt-get install
[none]	[14:45]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: so you've got no special cable clients running on the ubuntu box, you just use plain dhcp?
[none]	[14:45]	<mut80r>	johnmike: after disabling DHCP you will no longer get any addresses from your network so you'd need to enter them manually into every machine on your network
[none]	[14:45]	<psych>	it asks for restart that Paavi2_0
[none]	[14:45]	<Nomikos_>	Daverocks: yes.
[none]	[14:45]	<ubuntung-pinoy>	mut80r: wud u recommend using a filesystem other than EXT3? wud that hav repercussions on my beautifully running hardy?
[none]	[14:45]	<psych>	it says 1 not fully installed or removed.
[none]	[14:46]	<jim_beam>	cut copy paste are single keys on keyboard -- real convenient.  maybe edit xorg.conf

[none]	[14:46]	<mut80r>	ubuntung-pinoy: I would not reccomend running *nix on anything other than EXT2/3. both are unrecognisable to windows but you can get a program to open EXT3 filesystems.
[none]	[14:46]	<Daverocks>	Nomikos_: ok

[none]	[14:47]	<tj__>	yes
[none]	[14:47]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Ok! How do I make sure than my Ubuntu box is listening on the ports I need it to?
[none]	[14:47]	<mut80r>	johnmike: that all depends on the program you're running that needs the ports forwarded.
[none]	[14:47]	<tyler>	tj_: try manually editing xorg.conf
[none]	[14:47]	<tj__>	path?
[none]	[14:48]	<mut80r>	tj__: /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[none]	[14:48]	<johnmike>	mut80r: Yeah. I'm just trying to set it up mainly for transmission, but someone had told me that I had to be careful when selecting a port for use because specific ports are reserved for specific things.
[none]	[14:49]	<mut80r>	johnmike: select any port you want above 30000 as a safe rule. they can go up to 65535.

[none]	[15:14]	<nibsa1242b>	MttJocy: I figured out that if I remove the .running file from the .evolution directory in my home folder it doesn't know that it crashed and starts up normally.

[none]	[15:37]	<Dante123>	okay, well I am still a skeptic because the original boot prob is sporadic anyway.  Sometimes it boots fine on first try.  But I will do as you say and see if the hangs are done.

[none]	[15:49]	<gmenelau>	bazhang what is kde3 or kde 4 ?
[none]	[15:49]	<josh04_>	bagelong: Apparently we need to add something to /etc/rc.local
[none]	[15:49]	<dmsuperman_>	ifireball: That's what I thought, but it always outputs bz2 files. Even a simple command, compressing a single file like that makes it 0 bytes

[none]	[15:51]	<dmsuperman_>	ghostknife: That works. I am running this to backup 5GB worth of data though, so would it be a whole lot slower to archive and then compress as you suggested?
[none]	[15:51]	<eternal_p>	vicky123_: you will be better served, if you are new to ubuntu to use the x86 rather than 64-bit
[none]	[15:51]	<tseug>	mut80r, same thing 'No such file or directory'

[none]	[16:28]	<PhotoJim>	hilts50: k.  that's the extent of my intelligent advice, alas.  but it might pay to read the grub man page.  perhaps you can manually install the boot sector on the external drive, if it's missing.  I assume the drive isn't coming up at all and you're not even getting grub.
[none]	[16:29]	<red_>	mut80r i dont get you sorry. im now opening the link you just gave me

[none]	[16:43]	<mut80r>	J-Unit: yes. it's a numerical value assigned to each process.
[none]	[16:43]	<AtomicSpark>	Haha. For lulz i opened my clock to see if gnome would freeze. it did. -_-
[none]	[16:43]	<bazhang>	auruspex: best to ask in #compiz for that

[none]	[16:43]	<mut80r>	yahya__: stick a live cd in and mount your system and edit fstab there.

[none]	[16:44]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, the one you're looking for (if a program locked up or doesn't respond to -15) is SIGKILL (or -9)
[none]	[16:44]	<El1>	Is there anybody who knows on which packages the hardware drivers manager depends? Or where I can look this up?
[none]	[16:44]	<bazhang>	gapagos: nay

[none]	[16:45]	<as2000>	is there a legacy driver for ati cards?
[none]	[16:45]	<gapagos>	Creeture, thats something linux zealots should work on lol
[none]	[16:45]	<bazhang>	!away > Scrounch
[none]	[16:45]	<crashanddie>	J-Unit, so the syntax would be kill -9 PID, you can get the process ID through ps (man ps), alternatively, you could use killall to bypass the PS step, and directly give the name of processes to kill

[positive]	[16:47]	<mut80r>	Wiredtape: if you're removing grub or ubuntu, after removing it you will need to reinstate the other OS'es bootloader. if it's vista you can do this from recovery options on the vista dvd. otherwise go into recovery mode from an XP cd

[none]	[18:25]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: so in this case... you may want to file a bug report if you can for sure use the card in another software environment.  e.g. windows... ubuntu live cd... another distro.
[positive]	[18:25]	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: and on a hardware point, check your BIOS temps, after say 30 mins of desktop use
[none]	[18:25]	<enfefi>	I need help with the time in Ubuntu 8.04. At boot time I got this error: 8254 Timer not connected to IO-ACPI and in Gnome the time is wrong. My machine is a Pavilion zx5369cl laptop
[none]	[18:25]	<pyrak>	and i can't adjust the resolution to be above 800x600
[none]	[18:25]	<dreamcoder>	should i use 64bit or 32bit?
[positive]	[18:25]	<_alf_>	mindlord: i think it's built into xorg. i don't have anything like that running either, and yet my alt-tab rotates windows in 3d
[positive]	[18:25]	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: nuthin is extreme if it allows u 365+ uptime :)
[none]	[18:25]	<herbaliser>	wishie no
[none]	[18:25]	<amenado>	keycool1-> then you proly have to hunt around what drivers supports your cisco aeronet..
[none]	[18:25]	<NightBird>	amenado: okay, how do I set it to either try the 8139too driver, or(worst case), disable ethernet completely?
[none]	[18:25]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: how much ram
[none]	[18:25]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: but I would doublecheck that before hand.  boot from a live cd and see...
[none]	[18:25]	<fiXXXerMet>	How reliable is a live update from 7.10 to 8.04?  Is it best to format and start clean?
[none]	[18:25]	<g0th_>	hmm, bitchx was removed from ubuntu 8.04?
[none]	[18:25]	<dreamcoder>	1gb
[none]	[18:25]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: ok, thanks. But it's very strange, because I could connect on this pc, which has the same card
[none]	[18:25]	<ruewan>	someone told me 32
[none]	[18:25]	<agnul>	uhm... yay for me! just moving the themes from my home folder to usr/share/themes did the trick
[none]	[18:25]	<bazhang>	32 bit dreamcoder
[positive]	[18:25]	<lch_>	dreamcoder: when you ask? 32 bits ;-)
[none]	[18:25]	<_alf_>	g0th_: yeah, it has security issues
[none]	[18:25]	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, it says 2.6.24-16-generic
[positive]	[18:25]	<plik>	g0th_: irssi ftw :)
[none]	[18:25]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: yeah then its likely a card issue...
[negative]	[18:25]	<Marce_>	z0g, yes it is... it appears to be running... i can only get working with nv driver, with nvidia one xorg crashes by that reason :/
[none]	[18:25]	<_alf_>	g0th_: yeah, irssi
[none]	[18:25]	<Laser88>	OldSocks: it's somewhere here - ~/.mozilla/firefox
[none]	[18:25]	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, thats the right kernel correcT?
[positive]	[18:25]	<bazhang>	Auctionedllama: then you are final! ;]
[none]	[18:26]	<mindlord>	_alf_, I don't think upgrading from gutsy to hardy turned it on.
[none]	[18:26]	<g0th_>	kk
[none]	[18:26]	<dreamcoder>	i thought 64bit had speed increases though?
[none]	[18:26]	<Al-Khouli>	guys, SOS, i am facing this damned error in the middle of upgrading to hardy: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[none]	[18:26]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: I'll try with another live-cd
[negative]	[18:26]	<z0g>	Marce_, it sounds weird :/
[none]	[18:26]	<Auctionedllama>	bazhang, yip, the day after I installed i had 300 megs of upgrades
[none]	[18:26]	<z0g>	tried installing the driver using synaptic?
[none]	[18:26]	<J-Unit>	"fiXXXerMet, everything u sudo apt-got will remain other apps wont, thats all i can say but upgrading is better since u dont have to ""restart ur life"""
[none]	[18:26]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: also... try rebooting without the nic plugged in... and retry
[none]	[18:26]	<amenado>	NightBird-> try to boot from the liveCD and see if it detects same chips, and see if you get same errors
[positive]	[18:26]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: only if you dislike youtube ;]
[none]	[18:26]	<keycool1>	amenado: I've been looking, can't seem to find, not sure I know where is best to look
[none]	[18:26]	<NightBird>	amenado: I'm botting from the liveCD, and getting the same errors
[none]	[18:26]	<Marce_>	z0g, nop, i'll do it
[none]	[18:26]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: trying to see if anything on the switch/router is locking it up.
[none]	[18:26]	<dreamcoder>	i managed to get flash working in a 32bit browser on kubuntu 8.04
[none]	[18:26]	<z0g>	:?
[none]	[18:26]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: nic plugged in?
[positive]	[18:26]	<z0g>	*:>
[positive]	[18:26]	<Marce_>	:D
[none]	[18:26]	<amenado>	keycool1-> which cisco model do you have?
[none]	[18:26]	<dreamcoder>	it would work the same on ubuntu am i right?
[none]	[18:26]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: what's that?
[none]	[18:26]	<Marce_>	brb
[none]	[18:26]	<z0g>	did the trick for me Marce_
[positive]	[18:27]	<_alf_>	"mindlord: tell me this, if you go into system, preference, apperance, visualization and then select the ""Extra"" option. does it ask you to restart or anything?"
[none]	[18:27]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: nic = network interface card...
[none]	[18:27]	<bazhang>	dreamcoder: I meant flash and 64 bit have a bit of a hassle getting going
[none]	[18:27]	<amenado>	NightBird-> cant do much then if your liveCD also detects same,  how about older 7.10 livecd ?
[negative]	[18:27]	<Marce_>	zog, but i wanted to have propertary drivers working :(
[negative]	[18:27]	<dinho-br>	Kr0ntab: as I said, I have a dual-boot with Windows, and it is working... :(
[none]	[18:27]	<Juanfer>	FIREFOX and SYNAPTIC Not Connecting.... why this happens?
[none]	[18:27]	<dreamcoder>	okie
[none]	[18:27]	<NightBird>	amenado: those work fine.  is there no way to boot the livecd with that driver disabled?
[none]	[18:27]	<amenado>	keycool1-> which cisco model do you have?  many aeronet versions and models
[positive]	[18:27]	<lch_>	dreamcoder: i use 64bits as base and have a 32 bit ubuntu in a chroot for the browser with plugins. butu using 32bits directly is easier :-)
[none]	[18:27]	<Al-Khouli>	how to solve this error: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libxml2.so.2: undefined symbol: gzopen64
[none]	[18:27]	<Al-Khouli>	??
[none]	[18:27]	<keycool1>	amenado: I bet....how can I check?
[none]	[18:28]	<amenado>	NightBird-> you have not installed 8.04 yet?
[none]	[18:28]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: ahh okay...
[none]	[18:28]	<g0th>	hi
[positive]	[18:28]	<gor1>	ï»¿ mindlord: another point is install fluxbox, that bypasses a lot of the gnome desktop crud,  simply sudo apt-get install fluxbox, at the GDM greeter, go to change session at bottom right, select fluuxbox, you right-click for the menu, most stuff in applications at top of list, just avoid using nautilus as a noob with fluxbox ;)   If no fluxbox probs then ur prooblem maybe gnomey-related
[none]	[18:28]	<amenado>	keycool1-> labels on the device perhaps?
[none]	[18:28]	<g0th>	(I now have irssi)
[none]	[18:28]	<Laser88>	juanfer: anything else connecting?

[none]	[18:28]	<pyrak>	i'm having problems with my video card.  i logged in as a different user, and no luck.  it was working fine until i plugged this machine into a projector.  help!
[none]	[18:28]	<NightBird>	amenado: I tried to do an upgrade from 7.10, but it locked up my computer nearing the end, and it may have wiped out the driver my /home/ partition was on
[none]	[18:28]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: yeah im sorry mate.  i do need to step out though.  sorry i couldnt help ya out for now.
[none]	[18:28]	<g0th>	so another issue: when I compile my kernel with make-kpkg binary-arch, I get this message:

[none]	[18:29]	<mindlord>	_alf_ no, but I've used compiz on this computer before without lockups or anything, I just turned it all off for speed. Only 1ghz cpu
[none]	[18:29]	<g0th>	what directory do they mean?
[none]	[18:29]	<Kr0ntab>	dinho-br: no sweat.
[none]	[18:29]	<amenado>	NightBird-> it should not wipe out your /home  if you have it in separate partitions..try to boot from older 7.10 livecd?
[none]	[18:29]	<keycool1>	amenado: its internal, and it doesn't seem to say on the bottom of the laptop either
[none]	[18:29]	<jytd>	does hamachi work on ubuntu? Anybody tried this out?
[positive]	[18:29]	<_alf_>	mindlord: it'll make the gpu hot, upping the system temperature. i doubt it'll make the cpu hot
[none]	[18:30]	<amenado>	keycool1-> cisco is a well known brand perhaps if you can visit your vendors web site to dig info?
[none]	[18:30]	<herghost>	ompaul: thankyou, that link you found sorted my problem completely.  thanks for helping
[none]	[18:30]	<Juanfer>	pointer DISSAPEARS when wake-up, but still working
[positive]	[18:30]	<_alf_>	mindlord: if its cpu overheating issues you can pretty much ignore everything i've told you
[none]	[18:30]	<mindlord>	gor1, I'll try that. It hasn't locked up in about 45 minutes now.. It might be dirty power since I moved it.
[none]	[18:30]	<Juanfer>	pointer DISSAPEARS when wake-up, but still working

[positive]	[18:30]	<Laser88>	how to answer juanfer? :-)
[none]	[18:30]	<keycool1>	amenado: ok great, thanks for the help. also, should I assume I'm looking for a driver now, is that the issue?
[none]	[18:31]	<bazhang>	Juanfer: try ping google
[none]	[18:31]	<jytd>	gor1, Ok, and it's not in the repository, right?

[none]	[19:23]	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, hm i tried myself in the open dialog and failed, you are correct it doesn't work that way. I guess this functionality is not supported by gnome yet. What I do regulaly is to sftp to a site through nautilus and open a file in text editor and works fine
[none]	[19:23]	<Exteris>	pixelmonkey, i do have a lot of setgrabkeysstate, perhaps that's because of my window manager

[none]	[19:26]	<pixelmonkey>	Exteris, I just switched to the nv driver in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and I'm getting better performance.  I think there is some regression in the nvidia driver + X.org + possibly GNOME stuff like cairo.
[none]	[19:26]	<daemon3>	8 hours to complete the upgrade!!!!????!!!??

[none]	[19:26]	<gnomefreak>	bigtimer121: without seeing it i cant tell you exactly what is going to happen
[none]	[19:26]	<cvasilak>	gerardoj, maybe because they have restructured the IO layer in gnome with the introduction of gio and this feature was too late to implement but i agree with you its a handy feature for some people

[none]	[23:19]	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is not frozen.... mine sucked... on my pc, but rocked on my laptop..... so I transferred it and BAM! it was much better than before

[none]	[23:19]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, opened Places>Computer>78.6gig partition
[none]	[23:19]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, yes, that looks about *exactly* like your problem.

[none]	[23:20]	<ShadowCrawler>	can anyone help me get my wireless internet working with a new install of ubuntu
[none]	[23:20]	<Phoenix92x>	Is anybody else having trouble with virtualbox-ose? When I try to run it it complains that it can't find vboxdrv yet I don't even see that installed by the modules package, just vboxadd.ko. Is anyone else having a similar problem?
[none]	[23:20]	<krash3x>	Does anyone know about the 32 bit lib compatibility on the nvidia driver on 8.04?
[none]	[23:20]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, icon shows on desktop?
[none]	[23:20]	<djlenoir>	ferris, I tried to delete all the existing partitions, and even created a new partition table (wipe everything) in the installer... however, when I reboot, the partition is not gone. I guess it is queueing up the changes but does not apply them?
[none]	[23:20]	<bigtimer121>	some_person: same errors came up
[none]	[23:20]	<ferris_>	Bidget, I transferred the sites for the sources.list... but that was from the alternative disc... you may not need to worry about it at all... my laptop was an internet upgrade.... so I am not sure why it kept a better list
[none]	[23:20]	<bagelong>	josh04: if you are on and can help me again I'll surely love you for ever.  In a platonic way of course

[none]	[23:21]	<secleinteer>	hi, does anyone know if it's possible to disable the popup box that shows up when i connect to a ubuntu desktop through vnc?
[positive]	[23:21]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, this bug was probably exposed because they chose to move all PATA stuff into the scsci driver.
[positive]	[23:21]	<qbert>	unop: im on ubuntu :)
[none]	[23:21]	<adaminla>	just downloaded 8.04. How do I check integrity of same?
[none]	[23:21]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: yes, the drive itself is visible in /dev/ as sdc, but no partitions are there, just as described there.  What would be the correct package to set that bug to?
[none]	[23:21]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: right click the icon, does it show an option to mount/unmount?
[none]	[23:21]	<djlenoir>	ferris, I am using Live at the moment, is there a way I can prepare the hdds through Live?
[none]	[23:21]	<CJS3141>	unop: why not gksudo? qbert wants to run it as root.
[none]	[23:21]	<Bidget>	ferris_, I see... well, if I have problems with it after I upgrade then I'll see about fixing them I guess. for now I'll just let it upgrade
[none]	[23:21]	<kindofabuzz>	"i keep getting ""failed to connect"".  so i hit ""try again"" and it will connect.  sometimes i have to hit try again several times.  anyone know what the problem could be?  i assume it's the wireless"

[none]	[23:21]	<ferris_>	djlenoir, did you finish the writing before rebooting/
[none]	[23:22]	<bigtimer121>	some_person: same errors again
[none]	[23:22]	<ferris_>	Bidget, it is a good idea to do that.... it may work fine for you

[none]	[23:22]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: Hmm.  I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you.  Sorry.  Hopefully, one of the more knowledgeable members in here can give you a solution.  Good luck.
[none]	[23:22]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: ok, lets try reinstalling and uninstalling it
[none]	[23:22]	<djlenoir>	ferris, I could not finish the writing because my only option was to click Next and it told me I had not set up the partition to install Ubuntu to.
[none]	[23:22]	<CygnusX1>	Greetings.  Just installed 8.04 on a laptop with mobility x700.  ATI restricted driver installed, yet, fglrxinfo still shows mesa.
[none]	[23:22]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: sudo apt-get --reinstall install nvidia glx
[none]	[23:22]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, not sure about the package, but I'd bet it is a kernel problem.  And if it IS really a kernel problem, it might take a while to get solved, especially if the Ubuntu guys have to wait for upstream.
[none]	[23:22]	<Some_Person>	bigtimer121: then sudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-glx
[none]	[23:23]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, Thanks for trying, and sorry, i did this a month ago with 7.10 and had no probs
[none]	[23:23]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if I were you, I'd search the linux kernel mailing list.

[none]	[23:24]	<Dekkard>	my first clean ubuntu instal since feisty
[none]	[23:24]	<krash3x>	nope this was the first time I used ubuntu since 5.xx
[none]	[23:24]	<towlie>	Dekkard, problems specific to hardy
[none]	[23:24]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, if the problem is already solved in the newer kernels, than it is a matter of getting the Ubuntu devs to include the patch.  OR, you could do it yourself.
[none]	[23:24]	<rubikcube>	arbrandes: the LKML seems to have one entry at least on this, without an answer
[none]	[23:24]	<Dekkard>	like?
[none]	[23:24]	<ferris_>	djlenoir, go ahead and create the partition, click the check box to format and then once it is finished writing the partitions restart the computer (hard reset)
[none]	[23:24]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, well i didnt update, did fresh install to try to fix the wireless issue i've had for nearly 5 months
[none]	[23:24]	<Bidget>	UH OH
[none]	[23:24]	<ferris_>	you could also get a boot disk and kill the partitions as well

[none]	[23:27]	<Bidget>	k
[none]	[23:27]	<Xbehave>	i no haw to edit menu.lst but no idea what to add to grub for it
[none]	[23:27]	<arbrandes>	rubikcube, hehehe, I see.  Well, my relatively uninformed opinion is that it is probably a kernel issue, related to the move to the SCSI subsystem for PATA drives.  And if I were you, in this case I'd try to either use an older kernel, or try to recompile the current one turning off this PATA/SATA thing.
[none]	[23:27]	<SeaPhor>	raindog, hey, before i shutdown and installed 8.04 I copied my fstab to a USB flash drive, would it be safe to just copy and paste that one line into the new fstab? wouldn't use the same UUID?

[none]	[23:28]	<raindog>	SeaPhor: To tell you the truth, I'm unsure.  At least you can use the old fstab as a reference and compare to the new one.  Of course, make backup of the new fstab, but perhaps then you try to edit/add the line from the old copy.
[none]	[23:29]	<devtrash>	tseug, there should be no old install

[none]	[23:57]	<SpookyET>	shane2peru: upgrade froze on libpng, then a bunch of errors. It was pretty much gutsy. it was not customised
[none]	[23:57]	<shane2peru>	djlenoir, if there isn't anything on the other hdd, just unplug them and see if you can boot off the one.
[none]	[23:57]	<armada>	in gusty it would give that error

[none]	[23:57]	<tomtommy>	Platyhelminth, install Hardy Alternative ISO, not the liveCD one.  understood?
[none]	[23:58]	<shane2peru>	SpookyET, before doing an upgrade, you should, 1.  backup, 2 have a new disk handy in case of failure
[none]	[23:58]	<mkquist>	djlenoir: id go w/spookyet suggestion, take them out of the equation  till u get it working
[none]	[23:58]	<blankhead>	androver: no i uninstalled thru terminal with sudo apt-get remove awn-core-applets-bzr

[none]	[23:58]	<blankhead>	This application conflicts with other installed software. To install 'avant-window-navigator' the conflicting software must be removed first.

[negative]	[00:16]	<garu>	espen now, just before doing the restart, install the compiz configuration manager.Click on Applications, then Add/Remove Programs!
[neutral]	[00:16]	<speaker219>	OiPenguin: T130 I think

[neutral]	[00:17]	<garu>	Fastn sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[negative]	[00:17]	<Vlet>	pwnt-: that's probably why. it's not maintained
[negative]	[00:17]	<Dumptruck>	I think I am just going to redo the boot.ini in windows
[positive]	[00:18]	<pwnt->	Vlet: whenever I try to update. it shows nothing in my update list. It thinks i'm up-to-date :)
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Dumptruck>	from the windows install disc
[negative]	[00:18]	<YoDaddeh>	I cannot get the restricted ati graphics driver to load with the manager it says xorg-driver-fglrx is not enabled. How can I enable it?
[negative]	[00:18]	<pwnt->	Vlet: what should I do then.
[negative]	[00:18]	<OiPenguin>	vraa: Can you interpret @HLINK for me. I find it really hard to find a laptop with no issues.
[negative]	[00:18]	<Vlet>	pwnt-: you could upgrade, but I've heard people saying that it doesn't always go so well
[negative]	[00:18]	<dvayanu>	hi, i have a problem that my fonts are looking ugly after upgrade to gutsy
[negative]	[00:18]	<src>	Dumptruck, as you wish. I really don't know how windows handles this kind of stuff. it might work
[positive]	[00:18]	<Cable86>	cliechti: bah, darn translations :-P  i'm not sure what to tell you then unfortunately :-(
[positive]	[00:18]	<dvayanu>	in both kde and gnome

[neutral]	[00:18]	<vraa>	OiPenguin: are you ordering a new laptop?
[negative]	[00:18]	<Surb>	what's the difference between the gutsy server image and the others? less packages?
[neutral]	[00:18]	<src>	np
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Vlet>	pwnt-: if you can, it's best to just backup your stuff and install gutsy clean
[negative]	[00:18]	<pwnt->	Vlet: so a backup of my home/user then get a new .iso burn it and fresh install, is that what you think i should do?
[positive]	[00:18]	<generalsnus>	Guys.. i need some help here.. my friend has no cable network only his broadcom wireless..  he sees the driver in the restricted driver manager..but he cant ofc download it :/  is there some way i can find this driver and just send him the package(while he uses xp) ?
[neutral]	[00:18]	<Vlet>	Surb: no interface
[negative]	[00:18]	<espen>	"garu ,  is that the ""Advanced Desktop Effects Settings""? I had that installed from before"
[negative]	[00:18]	<Cable86>	Surb: gutsy server has no gui (no gnome or kde or anything)
[positive]	[00:18]	<pwnt->	Vlet: Okay. that what I'm going to do :)
[negative]	[00:18]	<YoDaddeh>	guess nobody knows how to help me with this problem :(
[negative]	[00:19]	<nancy_69>	Please guys i have a problem with the disable tabs of the compiz settings manager
[negative]	[00:19]	<Surb>	ah, okay.
[negative]	[00:19]	<Vlet>	pwnt-: yeah, you'll likely be happier with the results
[positive]	[00:19]	<vraa>	OiPenguin: if you check the links, it says that all issues with this laptop have been resolved. so that means with little or no effort, ubuntu will work fine :)
[positive]	[00:19]	<garu>	espen oh, ok then, then do the restart then :)
[negative]	[00:19]	<lavender_dream>	Tigerman: how did you fix it?
[negative]	[00:19]	<Dumptruck>	if you are ever in Bratislava I'll buy you a beer
[negative]	[00:19]	<OiPenguin>	vraa: Yes. I'd like to do it tonight, but I'm starting to think that I should wait a bit further to allow people to test Gutsy properly. The one I've borrowed is shitty, though.
[negative]	[00:19]	<Dumptruck>	third problem...

[neutral]	[00:21]	<Vlet>	pwnt-: the regular cd has the nice gui. It's if you install the server distro that you have to install the gui manually

[positive]	[00:21]	<espen>	garu , can i ask, what does the thing i installed do? THe xgl or something? :P
[negative]	[00:21]	<src>	Dumptruck, is it source code?
[negative]	[00:21]	<Dr_willis>	Dumptruck,  what is it you are trying to install? You will have some learning to do to install stuff from source.
[negative]	[00:21]	<Adam__>	anyone know of a firewall gui for ubunut?
[neutral]	[00:21]	<Dumptruck>	this all seems a bit over my head @HLINK
[neutral]	[00:21]	<garu>	espen xserver-xgl!as far as I know, it will install xgl, on your system. without it, you will not be able to get the effects, it will tell you that the composite extention is not available!but now that u did, it should be fine
[negative]	[00:21]	<Fastn>	garu: But does it have anything to do with compiz, because my card is in the blacklist of compiz
[negative]	[00:21]	<jo1>	does anyone know of anything similar to ultrasurf 8 for ubuntu?
[neutral]	[00:21]	<Dr_willis>	!firewall
[positive]	[00:21]	<ubotu>	Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see @HLINK or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).

[positive]	[00:30]	<charles>	does anyone know why the installer for bison can't find three packages
[negative]	[00:30]	<akaishi>	hrmm. why would editing a file cause it to become unreadable?
[negative]	[00:30]	<Joikast>	Can someone help me enable the graphics driver? I cant get it work
[negative]	[00:30]	<mutable>	Hi. I read that in gusty is fixed nvidia driver (that doesn't cause out of mem bug). However I still see black windows :(.
[positive]	[00:30]	<Rob125>	Dumptruck: Sharpen live CDs into shurikens, and yield ps2 cables as whips.

[negative]	[00:30]	<noelferreira>	hi. how can i install beryl in 7.10 with nvidia?
[negative]	[00:30]	<Gursikh>	Hi, just installed gutsy, and when I click the quit button I have no shutdown on reboot?
[negative]	[00:30]	<witless>	G965 is blacklisted?  didn't intel release the technical info for that chip?
[negative]	[00:30]	<charles>	3 files not found on bison upgrade, any help?
[neutral]	[00:31]	<Cable86>	noelferreira: you don't want to install beryl, as it is no longer maintained....7.10 comes with compiz fusion by default
[negative]	[00:31]	<Joikast>	Can someone help me enable the ATI graphics driver? I cant get it work..
[negative]	[00:31]	<mutable>	Do I need to manually update nvidia driver?
[neutral]	[00:31]	<espen>	garu , hey again
[negative]	[00:31]	<garu>	Fastn humn...that's pretty bad :o..sorry about that :o
[negative]	[00:31]	<noelferreira>	Cable86: can you give me an howto to install it?
[neutral]	[00:31]	<bashvean1>	It's been about 2 days and tracker is still indexing, anyone know what's going on? running Ubuntu 7.10 by the way
[negative]	[00:31]	<VousDeux>	My hardware is pretty new and is not yet fully supported by Gutsy. Can I expect additional hardware support to be included in future updates for Gutsy, or should I pursue Hardy?
[neutral]	[00:31]	<garu>	Joikast enable the restricted drivers
[neutral]	[00:31]	<Cable86>	!compiz

[negative]	[00:32]	<Fastn>	garu: Well do you know were i can get any information about when a new release get out or so?
[negative]	[00:32]	<CarlF1>	installed gutsy's nvidia, but direct rendering: No - is that expected ?
[positive]	[00:32]	<cliechti>	Cable86: anyway, thanks. i made some changes and will see if they actually work on next login :-)
[positive]	[00:32]	<espen>	And my keyboard is english (Its usually norwegian)
[negative]	[00:32]	<ArthurArchnix>	VousDeux: What isn't supported?
[positive]	[00:32]	<Cable86>	cliechti: sure thing :-)
[negative]	[00:32]	<espen>	garu yeah
[neutral]	[00:32]	<garu>	noelferreira why beryl when u can have compiz fusion?
[negative]	[00:32]	<garu>	Fastn humn...no idea :o!sorry
[negative]	[00:32]	<clyde>	I'm trying to stop the network manager from loading in Gutsy, every time I uncheck the option it resets on the next logon
[negative]	[00:33]	<VousDeux>	The video, the touch pad, HAL...a bunch of stuff.
[neutral]	[00:33]	<Fastn>	garu: Okey, thx anyway
[negative]	[00:33]	<bashvean1>	Anyone at all know how long Tracker should take to index?
[negative]	[00:33]	<garu>	espen what u just did, was supposed to fiz everything :o!lol
[neutral]	[00:33]	<Cable86>	noelferreira: it's already installed in 7.10
[neutral]	[00:33]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: What hardware? (whats not supported)
[neutral]	[00:33]	<garu>	espen fix
[neutral]	[00:33]	<espen>	gary it surely didnt
[negative]	[00:33]	<Cable86>	"noelferreira: but if you want to configure it more, install the package ""compizconfig-settings-manager"""
[neutral]	[00:33]	<mrfantastic>	does ndis still work for 7.10 or is it not needed any more
[negative]	[00:33]	<espen>	garu though the effects are working now
[positive]	[00:33]	<mutable>	Guys, I still see black windows with compiz on ubuntu
[negative]	[00:34]	<Dumptruck>	@HLINK - what does this mean?
[neutral]	[00:34]	<garu>	espen how r ur pc specs?RAM and Graphics?
[negative]	[00:34]	<espen>	garu ,my ram is 1 gig
[negative]	[00:34]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: Nvidia 8500GT only works in 1600x1050, touch pad doesn't work right, HAL has problems with power managment...other stuff too
[negative]	[00:34]	<mutable>	I's really bad, I just want a small amount of its features, but that black windows disrupts me
[negative]	[00:35]	<Dumptruck>	I would like to repost on the thread I found so that I might help others who have this problem
[positive]	[00:35]	<ArthurArchnix>	I wouldn't expect support for that to be backported to Gutsy. You're best bet is to keep an eye on kernel developments and file bug reports trying to get support for your hardware added in.
[neutral]	[00:35]	<espen>	garu i dont know about my graphics, cause i dont know what kind of graphic card i have
[neutral]	[00:35]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: I've been working on this stuff since August in #ubuntu+1, and I've filed several bug reports.
[neutral]	[00:36]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: Depending on the reasons, it'll vary.  If its bugs, they can (theoretically) be fixed, if its kernel support, you'll have to wait for the kernel version in ubuntu to catch up.
[neutral]	[00:36]	<garu>	espen try lspci
[negative]	[00:36]	<ArthurArchnix>	VousDeux: But this is kernel development stuff, not Ubuntu stuff. Filing bugs against ubuntu wouldn't do anything.
[neutral]	[00:36]	<livingdaylight>	my internet connection is sooooooooooooooooo slow
[neutral]	[00:36]	<espen>	garu what_
[neutral]	[00:36]	<espen>	?
[neutral]	[00:36]	<ArthurArchnix>	What flannel said
[negative]	[00:36]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: much of my problems have to do with the x86_64 too
[negative]	[00:36]	<facugaich>	Are there any official torrents?
[negative]	[00:36]	<garu>	garu anywayz, if u got 1 gig of ram, I would assume ur graphics arent that bad either, it should run fine
[negative]	[00:36]	<livingdaylight>	is it gutsy or my isp?
[neutral]	[00:36]	<garu>	espen at the terminal lspci
[negative]	[00:36]	<espen>	Ok
[neutral]	[00:37]	<Flannel>	facugaich: There are.  What torrent are you looking for?
[neutral]	[00:37]	<VousDeux>	Flannel, ArthurArchnix: so, will these kernel updates apply to Gutsy then?
[neutral]	[00:37]	<facugaich>	Flannel: Ubuntu 7.10 Desktop
[negative]	[00:37]	<ghatak_mobile>	Hi, i upgraded to Gusty from Fiesty. Upgrade went OK, however there is not compiz and when i do, glxinfo | grep direct, it returns NO. I have Nvidia 8600GT and it was working fine on Fiesty. I have installed the most recent Nvidia driver from Nvidia site but that does not make any difference. Help please.
[neutral]	[00:37]	<efpdv1>	do sound drivers come with ubuntu?
[neutral]	[00:37]	<Dr_willis>	facugaich, @HLINK:6969/
[negative]	[00:37]	<espen>	garu ok i did it
[neutral]	[00:37]	<Flannel>	facugaich: @HLINK  theyre all in there
[neutral]	[00:37]	<garu>	espen now check what graphics do u have
[neutral]	[00:38]	<espen>	garu adeon 9200 PRO
[negative]	[00:38]	<K3nt>	is there anything better than pidgin for msging?
[positive]	[00:38]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: Kernel updates (fixes) will, kernel versions (which is where a lot of the new hardware comes in) wont.  Gutsy will always have 2.6.22
[neutral]	[00:38]	<K3nt>	!msn

[neutral]	[00:38]	<jmg>	hi all
[positive]	[00:38]	<ezhateoven>	is my loopback config correct in ubuntu 7.10 @HLINK
[neutral]	[00:38]	<jmg>	is there a gnome katapult?
[negative]	[00:38]	<bnovc>	how can I install pangocario package in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[00:38]	<garu>	espen ur graphics r way better than mine!lol
[negative]	[00:38]	<facugaich>	Flannel: Oh, thanks, they are kinda hidden
[negative]	[00:38]	<ArthurArchnix>	VousDeux: Kernel updates tend to only patch issues, not add support for new hardware. I fear you're going to have to learn how to build and compile a kernel from source. You're either going to have to force Gutsy to use the lateest kernels from kernel.org, and file bug reports against it.
[negative]	[00:39]	<Slart>	ghatak_mobile: I had the same problem with my 8800.. I had to go back to my old xorg.conf and do lots of other things before I could run compiz again.. the failsafe mode didn't work for me..
[positive]	[00:39]	<ArthurArchnix>	Again, what flannel said. :P
[neutral]	[00:39]	<espen>	garu they are?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Flannel>	ArthurArchnix: yeah, we've gotta stop stealing each others fire
[negative]	[00:39]	<espen>	garu how come im lagging?
[positive]	[00:39]	<lavender_dream>	easy question to some of you, is it possible to browse the 'net as just text via the terminal? :) if so how?
[neutral]	[00:39]	<efpdv1>	does ubuntu come packaged with a firewall?
[negative]	[00:39]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: ahhh...so if I want my hardware to work, I will need Hardy and I will have to submit bug reports to kernel team?
[negative]	[00:39]	<garu>	espen yep...no idea...
[neutral]	[00:39]	<jmg>	lavender_dream: lynx or elinks
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Slart>	lavender_dream: lynx is a text only browser
[neutral]	[00:39]	<ArthurArchnix>	You're always first. But my fingers are fat soo... there's that too.
[negative]	[00:39]	<Flannel>	lavender_dream: sure.  Theres a bunch of terminal clients, type 'www-browser' in the terminal, and you'll get one (depending on whats default on your system)
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Allenwr>	sup guys
[neutral]	[00:39]	<Rabiddog>	Anyone know what this info reported in dmesg is about:

[negative]	[00:40]	<garu>	espen the effects only work well in my graphics card in 2 linux distros.lol
[negative]	[00:40]	<espen>	garu maybe i need the drivers_
[negative]	[00:40]	<ghatak_mobile>	Slart: Hmm... What exactly did you do to get it back,?
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Dr_willis>	lavender_dream,  theres also some way to get some basic graphics in the console with those browsers.
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Dr_willis>	isent it elinks -g ?
[neutral]	[00:40]	<mrfantastic>	can anyone direct me to someone or a guide for wifi on 7.10...i upgraded through the software updater in 7.04 if that helps
[neutral]	[00:40]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: Bug reports to the kernel team will help, especially if its not already supported.  I know I'm waiting for 8.04 for some HW on my thinkpad.
[negative]	[00:40]	<lavender_dream>	jmg, Slart: thanks, will look into that, I just want to see if I can browse the 'net just in text INSIDE the terminal if that makes any sense, very new to this
[neutral]	[00:40]	<WKTV|Archive>	Hey
[positive]	[00:41]	<Flannel>	lavender_dream: A full desktop experience is more or less available from the terminal, yes.
[negative]	[00:41]	<K3nt>	any wow users here?
[neutral]	[00:41]	<MattJ>	K3nt: Messaging on any particular network?
[positive]	[00:41]	<lavender_dream>	Flannel: that's cool :)
[negative]	[00:41]	<witless>	"i lost my X session during install, now when my machine boots, i can't log into the console at all.  i enter my login name and it says ""login incorrect"" without even asking me for my password..."
[negative]	[00:41]	<Slart>	ghatak_mobile: I wish I know.. I copied my old xorg.conf (it's backed up.. check for filenames like xorg.conf.200710101452 or similar).. I reinstalled the binary driver from nvidias site.. I did a lot of smaller stuff I got from googling then all of a sudden it all worked again
[positive]	[00:41]	<MattJ>	K3nt: Otherwise I recommend Jabber, and use Gajim for a client
[negative]	[00:41]	<Flannel>	witless: at GRUB, try selecting the recovery console
[negative]	[00:41]	<ArthurArchnix>	witless: Is your capslock or numlock on?
[neutral]	[00:41]	<WKTV|Archive>	anyone here use wubi?
[negative]	[00:41]	<witless>	Flannel: thanks, i'll try that.  ArthurArchnix: no
[negative]	[00:41]	<K3nt>	MattJ: i just wanted something that supported offline users. msn preferably

[negative]	[00:42]	<Fasm1>	newbie: anyone has any suggestion on how to make 7.10 work with dual monitors? The System > Admin > Screen & Graphics  does not take the 2nd monitor's settings... is it because I'm on a live-cd of U7.10?
[negative]	[00:42]	<Allenwr>	sorry
[neutral]	[00:42]	<Slart>	lavender_dream: that's what lynx and elinks does.. text mode browser you can run in a terminal
[negative]	[00:42]	<Flannel>	witless: If it works, you'll get a root shell, from which you can try and sort stuff out (its single user mode)
[negative]	[00:42]	<witless>	Flannel: ok
[positive]	[00:42]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: sorry, I new to all of this new hardware support stuff...if I work with the kernel team, can I apply the new kernel to the Gutsy distro I installed, or will I need a whole new distro?
[negative]	[00:42]	<ghatak_mobile>	Slart: was it all to do with xorg.conf ?
[neutral]	[00:42]	<MattJ>	K3nt: Jabber does, and it is open (not controlled by Microsoft), if you have the option, try it out
[negative]	[00:42]	<airtonarantes>	Fasm1, I already tried here, but dont worked
[positive]	[00:42]	<Wipster>	when I install Gutsy and hit the restrcted modules program to enable my gfx card drivers, is their any benifit to the nvidia driver installed with envy, and will it break it if I reinstall with that?
[positive]	[00:43]	<lavender_dream>	Flannel: that www.browser tip you just gave me... THAT'S REALLY COOL! :) it's quaint, I love it
[negative]	[00:43]	<Fasm1>	airtonarantes: I was so waiting for 7.10 for the dual monitor thing
[neutral]	[00:43]	<warbler>	!envy
[negative]	[00:43]	<ubotu>	envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[neutral]	[00:43]	<lavender_dream>	Flannel: err.. www-browser I meant
[positive]	[00:43]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: You can compile a newer kernel yes.  Although its technically not 'supported'
[neutral]	[00:43]	<YoDaddeh>	can anyone help me with gutsy?
[negative]	[00:43]	<Rabiddog>	ubuntu nvidia drivers suck
[neutral]	[00:43]	<Rabiddog>	lol
[positive]	[00:43]	<lavender_dream>	Slart: thank you very much, i'll look into that as well.
[negative]	[00:43]	<WKTV|Archive>	whts wrong with this rabiddog?
[positive]	[00:43]	<airtonarantes>	Fasm1, Well, work, but the screen is configured with resolution 640x580
[negative]	[00:43]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: Ubuntu is linux just like any other, you can do anything you want with it.  The only limit is how dirty you want to get your hands.
[neutral]	[00:44]	<Rabiddog>	WKTV|Archive, alot of work needs to be done on the installation script
[negative]	[00:44]	<Slart>	"ghatak_mobile: well.. one thing was that X used the file xorg.conf.failsafe instead of xorg.conf . I don't know how that got fixed.. perhaps by running the ""sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver"".. perhaps by reinstalling drivers.. I wish I knew more precisely"
[negative]	[00:44]	<Fasm1>	airtonarantes:  hmmm... I didn't try any lower resolutions, but I wouldn't want to use the 2nd monitor with lower resolutions
[positive]	[00:44]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: I see...thank you...my main concern is hardware support before Ubuntu support, once I have all of the hardware working I can worry about other stuff.
[negative]	[00:44]	<nivekc1>	how do i setup my video resolutions
[negative]	[00:44]	<bluefox83>	how do you change a hard drive designation from /hda-1 to /hda1?
[neutral]	[00:44]	<Wipster>	warbler, I havn't had anyproblems with it in the past but warning heeded, leaving it alone heh
[neutral]	[00:44]	<js_>	VousDeux: the ubuntu kernel has basically everything enabled
[neutral]	[00:44]	<airtonarantes>	Fasm1, yes, of course. nor me
[negative]	[00:44]	<ghatak_mobile>	Slart: Ok i will dig around thanks
[neutral]	[00:44]	<zakman>	when is ubntu going to use the new 2.6.23?
[negative]	[00:45]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: you might try some of the other distros that keep up to date with stuff, see if the HW works there (so yo uknow its the kernels deficiency and not an issue with your compile or whatnot)
[neutral]	[00:45]	<zakman>	officially
[neutral]	[00:45]	<nivekc1>	like not pick the one i want to use but add them to that list of ones i can use
[neutral]	[00:45]	<Flannel>	zakman: Hardy, if not a later kernel
[neutral]	[00:45]	<VousDeux>	js_: my hardware was too new to be included in the Gutsy support
[neutral]	[00:45]	<zakman>	Hardy ;o
[negative]	[00:45]	<zakman>	why so long?
[neutral]	[00:45]	<warbler>	Wipster: it is the official line - never needed it myself
[negative]	[00:45]	<zakman>	not even like a apt-get upgrade? sorta thing?
[positive]	[00:45]	<Tortured>	i have a fiesty laptop im trying to bring up a usb drive with thats plugged into a gutsy desktop. I have opened shared folders on the desktop, installed nfs, and added the laptops IP address to the usb drives available connections, but i dont see it on the network still? what am i missing
[positive]	[00:45]	<Allenwr>	Where is the best place to find video drivers?
[positive]	[00:45]	<espen>	garu now i cant even switch back to norwegian keyboard
[negative]	[00:45]	<airtonarantes>	Fasm1, but with a time I guess that you can
[positive]	[00:45]	<Flannel>	zakman: Because ubuntu is a time based release, which means major versions for things get frozen per release
[negative]	[00:45]	<Allenwr>	I need one for a NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200
[positive]	[00:46]	<Rabiddog>	zakman, compile your own kernel :)
[neutral]	[00:46]	<BrokenPipe>	Did something change with how Xinerama is set in xorg.conf? I'm using the same config file and hardware, and with 7.10 xinerama is not working. Ideas?
[negative]	[00:46]	<zakman>	i guess. i dont like to though.
[negative]	[00:46]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: that way at least you'll know what versions you need to use (or what bug reports you need to file)
[negative]	[00:46]	<K3nt>	can any wow users help me with it in ubuntu? i have wine
[positive]	[00:46]	<Wipster>	warbler, I got tird of all the steps with my ati card back in the day, hence looking for an easier option
[negative]	[00:46]	<airtonarantes>	Fasm1, Gutsy least is rather than Feisty
[negative]	[00:46]	<zakman>	too much effect then when its in the official repo
[negative]	[00:46]	<K3nt>	or even anybody that knows what to do lol
[neutral]	[00:46]	<bluefox83>	Tortured, you wont see nfs on the networks thingy for some reason...i think it's cus nfs isn't a browse-able protocol
[neutral]	[00:46]	<Flannel>	K3nt: @HLINK

[positive]	[00:47]	<MattJ>	FLSimpsonKPT: If you ask a question, they can but try :)
[neutral]	[00:47]	<bleubeard>	nivekc1, you need to setup xorg in ubuntu?
[negative]	[00:47]	<Tortured>	bluefox83, really .. boy that stinks .. so is there a network i can use thats browse-able?
[negative]	[00:47]	<K3nt>	TravisAlaKing: do you remember what guide you followed? or maybe you just know what to do?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<VousDeux>	Flannel: Such as Hardy? or are you suggesting a completely different distro like Kanotix?
[neutral]	[00:47]	<warbler>	Wipster: ati needs better support - I here that is being worked on... - be  nice for christmas!
[neutral]	[00:47]	<twilight>	hello

[negative]	[00:48]	<efpdv1>	maybe i should go google

[negative]	[00:48]	<FLSimpsonKPT>	How can i get my update manager to work again? When I installed gutsy it didn't automatically configure my Internet so it disabled the secure download server making it impossible for me to update. how can i fix this?

[neutral]	[00:49]	<ArthurArchnix>	twightlight: 2 ways, one if you don't want any volumes on desktop you can disable the feature in gconf (bear in mind your ipod, cd rom etc won't show up when plugged in). Second is to change the mount point.
[negative]	[00:49]	<bluefox83>	Tortured, you also need to define the directories you want to be shared in a config file...
[positive]	[00:49]	<twilight>	thanks
[neutral]	[00:49]	<Flannel>	VousDeux: Right.  Hardy wont be out in any usable form for months at least.  And then it'll be unstable as hell.  Try some rolling release distro (one that updates all the time) to see if the newer versions work or not

[negative]	[01:15]	<flick>	CroiX, seems then i'll like KDE too... could you give some examples
[negative]	[01:15]	<mistone>	is just me or gusty more buggy then any other ubuntu distro yet?
[negative]	[01:16]	<LM22>	I thought we were getting a tool with xorg 7.3 to force refresh rates and resolutions to take care of this bug
[negative]	[01:16]	<bluefox83>	Tortured, it's easy enough...you tell it what directories you want to share, and which machines are aloud to access them, and where you want them mounted...
[neutral]	[01:16]	<Rob125>	tigran: it's in apps -> nautilus in gconf
[positive]	[01:16]	<nibsa1242b>	flick: CroiX: I would like KDE more if it didn't make me think Windows. I use Ubuntu because I want to be different, not run something that could be almost mistaken for XP so I prefer Gnome for now.

[negative]	[01:17]	<pyrak>	sammyF, it's not a command, it's a .install file
[negative]	[01:17]	<flick>	CroiX, could you please cite some examples?
[positive]	[01:17]	<sammyF>	pyrak: chmod just changes the attributes of the file

[neutral]	[01:18]	<sammyF>	pyrak: may I ask what it installs?
[neutral]	[01:18]	<ArthurArchnix>	sn4k31 , sent you a pm with some stuff to try
[neutral]	[01:18]	<pyrak>	sammyf, a printer driver
[negative]	[01:18]	<mistone>	nibsa1242b: installing it was a  bitch, it started out at 800x600 which is fine, but the install dialog box went below the screen :{
[neutral]	[01:18]	<pyrak>	for a lexmark x75
[negative]	[01:18]	<bluefox83>	wow, ubuntu no longer offers support for xmms? interesting
[positive]	[01:18]	<reindeer>	Are there any mirrors available for the Mac PPC ( G3 and later )downs of Ubuntu? IF so, what are the addys?
[negative]	[01:18]	<CroiX>	flick: I haven't tried Gnome for several weeks, I would have to dig around a little, but the xchat interface is a good example...there is no way to use the tabbed channel mode which is really handy

[neutral]	[01:19]	<Tortured>	CroiX, yah there is, youve got to install regular xchat not xchat-gnome
[negative]	[01:19]	<Dumptruck>	... hmm
[positive]	[01:19]	<nibsa1242b>	mistone: from the live cd? I've never used a Ubuntu live cd. I've always done alternative install/ upgrade in place.
[negative]	[01:19]	<reindeer>	Also, I need to know if anyone on this channel has any experience with a Mac PPC install of Ubuntu?
[neutral]	[01:19]	<bastid_raZor>	bluefox83: go VLC or Mplayer
[negative]	[01:19]	<flick>	CroiX, if you mean xchat-gnome then i agree, i quickly rejected it... using xchat now
[negative]	[01:19]	<sammyF>	pyrak: when you type more .install, does it look like a script?
[negative]	[01:19]	<mistone>	nibsa1242b: oh ok
[negative]	[01:19]	<mistone>	I just tried adding a folder from inside the open dialog and it said it couldn't find it lol

[neutral]	[01:19]	<sammyF>	"pyrak: ""more .install"""
[negative]	[01:19]	<bluefox83>	CroiX, remove xchat-gnome and install xchat-common and you get your tabs back in whatever window manager you want to use

[positive]	[01:20]	<reindeer>	edubuntu, you're not stupid. Just need more info from us, that's all.
[negative]	[01:20]	<edubuntu>	Yeah
[neutral]	[01:20]	<edubuntu>	If you can help it would be amazing
[neutral]	[01:20]	<wastrel>	i like regular xchat batter

[neutral]	[01:20]	<mistone>	haha
[negative]	[01:20]	<CroiX>	my understanding is that anything you can install in gnome or kde can be installed in either one, let me dig around in the system stuff a little and see if I can find a better example
[neutral]	[01:20]	<edubuntu>	I just did a booboo on my server
[neutral]	[01:20]	<mistone>	comclusions
[neutral]	[01:20]	<pyrak>	sammf, i really think youre misunderstanding
[negative]	[01:20]	<YBH_1>	is there anyway to upgrade 7.04 to 7.10 using the install CD? i found instructions for the alternate cd but not the install CD
[neutral]	[01:21]	<csc`>	Gursikh: nice cloak
[neutral]	[01:21]	<localgod11>	jrib: but wouldnt 64 be peppier?
[positive]	[01:21]	<Gursikh>	csc`: THanks :-)
[neutral]	[01:21]	<pyrak>	sammyF, it's a file with extension .install
[negative]	[01:21]	<bluefox83>	holy crap it's about time, the upgrade manager is just *now* downloading the upgrades
[negative]	[01:21]	<localgod11>	i mean not faster per se but more responsive?
[neutral]	[01:21]	<pyrak>	sammyF, the file is called lxx74.install
[negative]	[01:21]	<Gursikh>	You wouldn't happen to know how to make Firefox ignore my GTK theme?
[positive]	[01:21]	<sammyF>	pyrak: lol ... okay .. I did misunderstand it :)
[negative]	[01:21]	<edubuntu>	I was trying to get sshfs to work right and it mounted to a directory that i did not set the owner to me first
[neutral]	[01:21]	<sammyF>	pyrak: thought the file was called .install
[negative]	[01:22]	<edubuntu>	I tried fusermount  -u umount  would not let me unbmount the fs
[positive]	[01:22]	<sammyF>	Agent_bob: heh ... thanks ... never said I was a pro and it's always good to learn new stuff
[positive]	[01:22]	<reindeer>	edubuntu, maybe you are able to assist with my efforts to dwon a Mac PPC variant of the latest stable release of Ubuntu. Would you have any info re: mirror sites?
[negative]	[01:22]	<edubuntu>	Sooooo.. . . . I tried rm the dir and it removed half of  my storage
[negative]	[01:22]	<nibsa1242b>	YBH_1: I think you have to use the alternate cd. And even then if you have any non-standard packages you end up waiting to dl their new versions.
[neutral]	[01:22]	<edubuntu>	I need to recover some files off of ext3

[neutral]	[01:23]	<mistone>	Tempus: partition in vista first
[positive]	[01:24]	<edubuntu>	i gotta get this 7 gb back
[positive]	[01:24]	<garu_>	Tempus just recize ur partition where vista is...but, it is recommended to defrag the dik beforehand :o
[negative]	[01:24]	<Dicey>	hey guys. I'
[negative]	[01:24]	<matthew_>	what's the name of the battery monitor application?
[negative]	[01:24]	<Tempus>	"mistone: i tried to ""Shrink"" the partition... said it could only free up like 4 gigs"
[negative]	[01:24]	<witless>	compiz doesnneither my desktop nor my laptop support com

[neutral]	[01:24]	<CroiX>	wastrel: thanks...I must be blind
[positive]	[01:24]	<payan>	can i get LVM at first install from Gutsy's disc?
[neutral]	[01:24]	<warbler>	edubuntu: oops - Actually, you can't! This is what one of the developers, Andreas Dilger, said about it:
[neutral]	[01:24]	<warbler>	In order to ensure that ext3 can safely resume an unlink after a crash, it actually zeros out the block pointers in the inode, whereas
[neutral]	[01:24]	<warbler>	"ext2 just marks these blocks as unused in the block bitmaps and marks the inode as ""deleted"" and leaves the block pointers alone."
[neutral]	[01:24]	<warbler>	"Your only hope is to ""grep"" for parts of your files that have been deleted and hope for the best."
[negative]	[01:24]	<Dicey>	what size should I make my root partition. Is 10 gigs enough.
[positive]	[01:24]	<garu_>	Tempus download a program called Paragon Partition Magic and recize it
[negative]	[01:24]	<wastrel>	matthew_: you mean the one in the panel?
[negative]	[01:24]	<mistone>	Tempus: what? are you sure that your harddrive isn't just full?
[negative]	[01:25]	<wastrel>	Dicey: 10gigs should be fine
[negative]	[01:25]	<Tempus>	mistone: sure not. the laptop is less than 6 weeks old
[negative]	[01:25]	<CrazyLucas>	Hey guys! Anyone upgraded to Gutsy Gibbon already?
[positive]	[01:25]	<Dicey>	thanks
[positive]	[01:25]	<reindeer>	edubuntu, I could sure use the help straight away. I have Ubuntu 5.10 for the Mac PPC and just need a fresh upgrade to 7.10. Wouuld you be able to guide me to low-traffic mirrors sites?
[positive]	[01:25]	<mistone>	It also has to do with continuous space
[neutral]	[01:25]	<matthew_>	wastrel:  the one that sits in the notification area:  it showed a green battery.
[negative]	[01:25]	<mistone>	you can move stuff around so you get continious freespace
[negative]	[01:25]	<Tempus>	mistone: so basically a defrag would help?
[positive]	[01:25]	<firefox90>	what is that advanced compiz control panel install command?
[negative]	[01:25]	<edubuntu>	Prolly better getting the iso off of a torrent
[positive]	[01:26]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: easiest is to have a second hard drive for each OS. (remember Linux will boot from an external HD, XP won't I don't know about Vista). Otherwise, partition first in Windows and make sure you are comfortable with Grub syntax if you are going to use Grub to boot. I prefer Grub as it lets me have a custom graphical boot menu of my dogs.
[positive]	[01:26]	<mistone>	Tempus: no thats what I mean
[positive]	[01:26]	<wastrel>	"matthew_: that's a panel applet, you can find it in ""add to panel"""
[negative]	[01:26]	<garu_>	Tempus the best option u have anyway, is to get winXP and dual boot it with ubuntu.forget vista.I was in the same situation...vista somehow always manages to screw things up
[neutral]	[01:26]	<nonrate>	hi
[neutral]	[01:26]	<PokoTao>	Does wine 0.9.47 work with Gutsy?
[neutral]	[01:26]	<nonrate>	I think Ubuntu is radical
[negative]	[01:26]	<networkn>	Hi There! I am trying to install 7.10 into a virtual machine, using virtual server, but I am getting emask errors? buffer overflow errors, right after I tell it to install/start ubuntu
[neutral]	[01:26]	<mistone>	hehe
[negative]	[01:26]	<Tempus>	well i hate to dump vista
[neutral]	[01:26]	<nonrate>	It's your hardware
[positive]	[01:27]	<nonrate>	You should definitely dump Vista
[positive]	[01:27]	<edubuntu>	I love to dump vista
[negative]	[01:27]	<reindeer>	Ubuntu would be radical if I am able to find a variant for my Mac G4.
[negative]	[01:27]	<matthew_>	wastrel:  no, it's an application that sits in the notification area.  the one you're thinking of is called Battery Charge Monitor
[neutral]	[01:27]	<Davy_Jones>	Tempus: me too
[neutral]	[01:27]	<edubuntu>	It makes me happy to remove it from anysystem
[negative]	[01:27]	<sampson>	for some reason kubuntu gutsy won't upgrade from beta to release
[neutral]	[01:27]	<localgod11>	Tempus: i dual boot vista
[negative]	[01:27]	<infornography>	I just have a quick question regarding the new ubuntu, I was thinking of installing it fully encrypted on my laptop, I just want to know if there will be a significant performance drop with encryption.
[neutral]	[01:27]	<garu_>	Tempus Vista=Resource Hog
[negative]	[01:27]	<nonrate>	Ubunutu should have a PPC build

[negative]	[01:27]	<Tempus>	agreed, garu_
[negative]	[01:27]	<sampson>	right after it downloads the kernel it says there are 5 packages that are no longer supported and then it says i don't need to update
[negative]	[01:27]	<akaishi>	any ideas how I could start from an existing 6.06 install that has a bunch of corrupted files and re-install it via internet connection?
[negative]	[01:27]	<nonrate>	not signifigant, unless your running a pentium II
[negative]	[01:27]	<mistone>	it uses all that ram as cache

[negative]	[01:28]	<mistone>	like yea it says its using all your ram
[negative]	[01:28]	<Tempus>	localgod11: how did you do it successfully?
[positive]	[01:28]	<reindeer>	Vista is nothinig short of a cheap Mac riop-off courtesy of the Evil Empire( MS ).
[neutral]	[01:28]	<mistone>	but its atcaully doing something smart
[neutral]	[01:28]	<localgod11>	install vista first thenubuntu
[neutral]	[01:28]	<mistone>	that being said
[positive]	[01:28]	<PokoTao>	Anyone? Does WINE 0.9.47 (latest release) work in Gutsy? Running ./configure gives me an error.
[negative]	[01:28]	<dxdt>	nonrate: they used to have them, they dropped it when apple dropped PPC basically.  It now exists unofficially I believe--maintained by the community only.
[negative]	[01:28]	<localgod11>	where are u running into a problem?
[negative]	[01:28]	<mistone>	its retarded
[positive]	[01:28]	<nonrate>	it allocates almost all ram in the newer linux kernels
[neutral]	[01:28]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: really if you can afford it or have an extra HD around just put Ubuntu on its own HD.
[neutral]	[01:28]	<networkn>	is ubuntu compatible with loading from a mounted iso vis daemon tools?
[neutral]	[01:28]	<steven_Office>	LOL
[neutral]	[01:28]	<garu_>	mistone yes it is, and not only because I'm saying so, it is proved...u shouldnt even dare to say no to that :o!but hey...that's ur opinion :o
[neutral]	[01:28]	<matthew_>	wastrel: found it, called gnome-power-manager

[positive]	[01:28]	<Tempus>	nibsa1242b: this is a laptop
[negative]	[01:28]	<mistone>	garu_:ok I am not denying its a resource hog
[neutral]	[01:28]	<flick>	which package contains the openssl/sha.h include file?
[negative]	[01:28]	<mistone>	but its not THAT bad
[negative]	[01:28]	<dxdt>	nonrate: well, that is my point, all builds now a days will be rogue builds.  They aren't officially supported.
[positive]	[01:28]	<steven_Office>	drop vista it will be your best move
[negative]	[01:28]	<PokoTao>	sampson: where did you find it?
[negative]	[01:29]	<dystopianray>	networkn: you want to mount the ubuntu livecd in daemon tools?
[negative]	[01:29]	<mistone>	its pretty bad tho
[negative]	[01:29]	<sampson>	i don't remember...let me check my cache
[negative]	[01:29]	<garu_>	Tempus my laptop came pre-installed with vista, and, in less than a month, I had problems
[negative]	[01:29]	<localgod11>	tempus: mines a laptop and i dont have a problem
[positive]	[01:29]	<Tempus>	localgod11: yeah i gather that... but surely it's a little more complicated than that
[neutral]	[01:29]	<viator>	use a live cd to partion
[neutral]	[01:29]	<PokoTao>	ok, thanks
[neutral]	[01:29]	<localgod11>	not really
[neutral]	[01:29]	<garu_>	Tempus wireless is a big pain in the arse on it
[neutral]	[01:29]	<Eagle3-->	is there any documentation on the new screen and graphics configuration tool in gutsy?
[positive]	[01:29]	<reindeer>	Nonrate, how would I be able to secure a copy of 7.10 for my G4( Sawetooth )?
[neutral]	[01:29]	<edubuntu>	or you could even download gparted live cd
[neutral]	[01:29]	<edubuntu>	like partition magic almost pretty gui
[positive]	[01:29]	<localgod11>	Garu: my wireless work fine using restriced drivers
[negative]	[01:29]	<stinger05>	if i choose the 1st option while installing ubuntu (the one which chooses free space) does it create a new partition? if so, would it be a secondary or primary partition?
[negative]	[01:29]	<garu_>	mistone when u say its not that bad, what r u comparing to?
[neutral]	[01:29]	<viator>	try gparted live cd
[negative]	[01:30]	<nonrate>	reindeer: I'm not sure, I acutally use openSuse atm but am thinking of using Ubuntu8

[negative]	[01:30]	<nonrate>	problem I have with ubuntu right now is I am a developer and use KDE, Ubuntu is not exactly developer or KDE friendly out of t6he box
[negative]	[01:30]	<garu_>	mistone would u consider a Core 2 Duo with 1 Gig of RAM or even 2, a modern computer?
[negative]	[01:30]	<PokoTao>	sampson: alright, thanks a ton.
[neutral]	[01:30]	<mistone>	garu_: yea fo sure
[positive]	[01:30]	<nonrate>	but it's fantastic as a Vista replacement, better than openSuse for that
[negative]	[01:30]	<viator>	i use dban and gparted
[neutral]	[01:30]	<Eagle3-->	can anyone point me to some help on the new screen and graphics tool?  specifically for getting dual monitors to work with an nvidia card
[negative]	[01:31]	<dystopianray>	nonrate: why not use kubuntu?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<garu_>	mistone how come it still struggles with vista? :s
[positive]	[01:31]	<zakman>	any Duo =  modern pc? :P
[negative]	[01:31]	<stinger05>	if i choose the 1st option while installing ubuntu (the one which chooses free space) does it create a new partition? if so, would it be a secondary or primary partition?
[neutral]	[01:31]	<mistone>	"garu_: ""struggle?"""
[positive]	[01:31]	<Bsims>	1248 of 1922 files fsck
[positive]	[01:31]	<mistone>	it works for me
[negative]	[01:31]	<localgod11>	garu: me 2
[neutral]	[01:31]	<networkn>	how much disk space does a full gutsy install need? would 10GB cover it?
[negative]	[01:31]	<Eagle3-->	stinger05: I would think it depends on how your current partitions are setup
[negative]	[01:31]	<garu_>	mistone check this out...start your machine, but dont do anything, u'll notice that, even though u'r not doing anything, the hdd is working like hell...
[negative]	[01:31]	<dystopianray>	networkn: 10GB should be fine
[negative]	[01:32]	<mistone>	garu_: wow. so what
[positive]	[01:32]	<mistone>	it works fine
[negative]	[01:32]	<Eagle3-->	networkn: depends on what you want to install, but yet that would probably be fine
[negative]	[01:32]	<dystopianray>	networkn: only uses a few GBs or so
[positive]	[01:32]	<nonrate>	dystopianray: I haven't tried it yet, but I may soon
[negative]	[01:32]	<localgod11>	garu_: nope
[negative]	[01:32]	<Fastn>	Can someone explain why my downloads are so slow, i download in 3,11kb
[negative]	[01:32]	<mistone>	trust me I hate vista as much as the next guy
[negative]	[01:32]	<reindeer>	Ok, nonrate. Does Novell maintain a Mac PPC variant for openSuSE atm?
[neutral]	[01:32]	<Bsims>	Hrm does the ubuntu install have to overright home etc
[neutral]	[01:32]	<Coolin>	can ubuntu resize ntfs partitions?
[negative]	[01:32]	<nonrate>	openSuse 10.3 failed to upgrade, and a reinstall was horrible
[negative]	[01:32]	<mistone>	but alot of poeples arguements suck

[positive]	[01:32]	<russ>	hi there!  is there a simple way to play sims on ubuntu, i have downloaded wine, but would be happy for a quick solution, rather than to read war and peace...
[neutral]	[01:32]	<PriceChild>	!offtopic | reindeer nonrate mistone
[negative]	[01:32]	<dystopianray>	Bsims: ubuntu install takes about 15-20 minutes

[neutral]	[01:33]	<viator>	i think he is just partioning the FREESPACE
[negative]	[01:33]	<flick>	ok never mind, i found the openssl/sha.h, it's in libssl-dev package
[neutral]	[01:33]	<moDumass>	im guty gibboning
[negative]	[01:33]	<Eagle3-->	stinger05: if there's room for a primary partition I assume it would create one...never tried it though...I always use manual setup
[negative]	[01:33]	<garu_>	mistone my lecturer wasted 35 minutes of the lecture just talking about that.lol
[negative]	[01:33]	<h1st0>	Okay i'm trying to get ssh working from the outside world.  It works fine from inside the lan.  So i'm assuming its a port forwarding issue on my router.  I hve a dsl router which is connected to a linksys router to serve my network.  The dsl router has an external ip but hte linksys has an internal ip.  I tried adding the port forward on the linksys but its not working any ideas?
[positive]	[01:33]	<Eagle3-->	is anyone familiar with setting up dual monitors in gutsy?
[negative]	[01:33]	<russ>	dystopianary, no, how do i do that?
[negative]	[01:33]	<viator>	his hd might be 200gb and all ntfs except 4-8 gb
[negative]	[01:33]	<Eagle3-->	I've done it by editing xorg.conf in feisty...but I can't figure out the new config tool
[negative]	[01:33]	<akaishi>	I need to do an install of ubuntu without a CD. Ideas?
[negative]	[01:33]	<dipu>	Hi there .. i have a SONY VAIO laptop ...i wanted to get my web-cam MOTION EYE working on ubuntu 7.10 ...any idea
[neutral]	[01:33]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: fun! I think Ubuntu wouldn't mind booting from a USB or Firewire drive... Or if you reinstall Windows, you can always partition the drive that way. There is always, gparted should be on the live CD... I think that can resize NTFS partitions.
[neutral]	[01:33]	<kibble>	akaishi: usb key?
[negative]	[01:34]	<dystopianray>	russ: insert your 'the sims' cd into your computer, open a terminal and run: wine /media/cdrom0/setup.exe (or install.exe or whatever it uses)
[negative]	[01:34]	<akaishi>	the only one I have is 256 mb
[neutral]	[01:34]	<Tempus>	nibsa1242b: noted. thanks, may give that a shot
[neutral]	[01:34]	<russ>	dystopianray, will give it a go
[negative]	[01:34]	<viator>	resize the ntfs windows partion to less than half the size of the hd
[neutral]	[01:34]	<lashmoove>	"im on a live tribe4 cd of gutsy, kubuntu, i dont want to overwrite my /home partition, so i want to mount one so i can see the contetnts, but im getting this ""hal-storage-fixed-mount refused uid 999"" when i right click to mount in konqueror"
[negative]	[01:34]	<networkn>	sadly I don't think gutsy will install using MS virutal server
[negative]	[01:34]	<VousDeux>	okay, so I uninstalled xchat-gnome and it's components. then I installed xchat-common, but there is no longer an icon on the menu to launch it...how do I launch it now?

[negative]	[01:36]	<kibble>	Eagle3--: I setup my internal lcd and external tv/lcd, didn't know gusty had a tool for that, I had to edit xorg.conf by hand

[neutral]	[01:36]	<World>	jrib thanks didn't see that.

[positive]	[01:37]	<YBH_1>	when doing the distribution upgrade for 7.10 from the Update Manager where are the downloaded files located at?
[negative]	[01:37]	<Eagle3-->	kibble: that's what I did in feisty...edited by hand...but the new screen and graphics tool lets you change configuration without restarting X...it seems like  maybe it's not fully functional so I might have to just resort to editing xorg.conf
[negative]	[01:37]	<kibble>	NeanT: it's a shell script and binary. you don't have the correct version, it's a 32bit and you need a 64bit version
[positive]	[01:37]	<Eagle3-->	kibble,it would just be nice to be able to disable a secondary monitor without restarting X
[negative]	[01:37]	<gore_>	why isn't mpeg123 in the repositories anymore
[negative]	[01:37]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: and I think if you defrag first it might help, but I don't really know anymore. Its been so long since I had to figure out how to set up a dual boot on one hd.

[positive]	[01:37]	<kibble>	Eagle3--: I'm a slack man from 95ish, I'm used to it :)
[negative]	[01:37]	<VousDeux>	maybe xchat-gnome is a good example of how gnome removes functionality

[neutral]	[01:38]	<jrib>	system_: stop
[neutral]	[01:38]	<YBH_1>	AndrewRy, you can format the HD from the install CD. It uses ext3 format
[neutral]	[01:38]	<kibble>	Fastn: how many seeders/leachers?
[neutral]	[01:38]	<AndrewRy>	I just hope I don't screw up my windows partition doing this.
[negative]	[01:38]	<Fastn>	akaishi: i dont download from ubuntu, i download from a random site
[positive]	[01:38]	<Eagle3-->	kibble: well Xorg in gutsy has extensions built in to change things on the fly...just gotta figure out how to do it
[negative]	[01:39]	<d00c4>	I have problem with setting up my resolution to 1680x1050. I have MSI RX2600PRO and LG L204WS. When I install drivers, Ubuntu reports that no screen is found and won't start X. Is there any solution, or I should change mi VGA to nVidia?
[negative]	[01:39]	<Fastn>	kibble: 3 seeders, 1 leacher
[negative]	[01:39]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: I think the worst part of it was that at the time I had to hand configure GRUB... I think the installer takes care of it by itself now.

[neutral]	[01:39]	<Tempus>	nibsa1242b: good to know
[neutral]	[01:39]	<AndrewRy>	YBH_1: I'm using the GParted program it has on the CD to do it, since the install froze up at the partitioner loading screen last time I tried.
[negative]	[01:39]	<YBH_1>	ok then just format for ext3
[negative]	[01:39]	<networkn>	how do I add noacpi to the install of gutsy
[neutral]	[01:39]	<networkn>	?

[negative]	[01:39]	<akaishi>	is it possible to boot the livecd and have it do a net install to a hard drive?

[neutral]	[01:40]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: just make sure if you can that you have a second computer nearby with Internet access. That way if you get stuck you can ask questions or google for answers and you should be fine. And of course, backup any data you don't want to use just in case something goes wrong.
[negative]	[01:40]	<YBH_1>	DerDritte, what do you mean crazy?
[neutral]	[01:40]	<kibble>	DerDritte: crazy how?
[neutral]	[01:40]	<DerDritte>	Freezes from time to time...
[negative]	[01:40]	<VousDeux>	DerDritte: sorry, not I...mine works fine, but I've been using Gutsy for quite awhile
[negative]	[01:41]	<AndrewRy>	"My install is still freezing at the ""Starting up the partitioner screen"", is it because of bad hardware, or filesystem (I know my Windows runs fine on this machine, too)."
[neutral]	[01:41]	<YBH_1>	DerDritte, try emptying the cache for firefox
[negative]	[01:41]	<Tempus>	nibsa1242b: right. i have no shortage of computers and hopefully no shortage of HD space... but the computer is so new i think i'd be okay if i had to wipe it clean
[negative]	[01:41]	<viator>	cafuego you are pretty knowlegeable when it comes to wireless
[negative]	[01:41]	<kibble>	DerDritte: yeah actually mine did that to, but it wasn't as annoying as the caret focus thing, once I turned that off I haven't noticed it crash once, F7 btw
[negative]	[01:41]	<nibsa1242b>	Tempus: well then... less risk if something goes wrong
[neutral]	[01:41]	<Tempus>	nibsa1242b: indeed

[neutral]	[01:42]	<VousDeux>	who was asking me (CroiX) about the functionality difference between kde and gnome?
[negative]	[01:42]	<viator>	it never did it dapper etc then in fiessty it started
[negative]	[01:42]	<edubuntu>	It was actually becaue the ntfs was corrupted if i waited about 10 minutes it would load up with he partition data
[negative]	[01:42]	<AndrewRy>	What did you do to make it stop?
[neutral]	[01:42]	<rtan>	hello
[neutral]	[01:42]	<viator>	in gutsy too

[negative]	[01:42]	<oam_>	i think i have a driver direct from Nvidia's page that is causing me problems ... how can i check the version of the driver to find out what file 7.10 is trying to use
[negative]	[01:43]	<kibble>	DerDritte: I'm not sure if I turned it on or last time I updated firefox it turned it on, but I got a cursor everywhere, even when there wasn't input boxes. that's caret focus, when I turned that off everything else seemed to land in place, including the freezing
[positive]	[01:43]	<viator>	the mouse server or what ever starts and restarts
[negative]	[01:43]	<akaishi>	this would all be easier if firefox segfaulting wasn't part of the problem :/
[neutral]	[01:43]	<viator>	over and over
[negative]	[01:43]	<viator>	but ONLY if i use the bcm43xx
[negative]	[01:43]	<edubuntu>	When i checked onthe errormesszges that it was outputting it said to boot under windpws and run chkdisk-f and reboot twice before it could make alterations to the ntfs partition

[neutral]	[01:43]	<CarlF1>	oam_:  cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version
[negative]	[01:43]	<DerDritte>	kibble: it's just firefox that freezes...
[negative]	[01:43]	<edubuntu>	sincei did not want anywindows at all i deleted the whole partition
[negative]	[01:43]	<viator>	if i use the linuxtant driver loader it doesnt do it
[negative]	[01:43]	<AndrewRy>	Okay, I'll probably just reformat this harddrive and then start from scratch. I don't have too much on my windows partition as it is, so it wouldn't be a problem. Anything to start using ubuntu. Thanks for the help.

[positive]	[01:51]	<JensenDied>	kibble: well this is an nvidia card on this machine, but its probably a similar issue
[positive]	[01:51]	<nibsa1242b>	RobotBanana: I think if you have control of the DHCP server on the wireless network, you can set it so that it always assigns a particular client the same IP.

[neutral]	[01:51]	<darkzero>	thx
[negative]	[01:51]	<bluebanana>	kibble: so how do i make the PARTIAL upgrade a COMPLETE one later on?
[negative]	[01:52]	<dmandell>	Megaqwerty: I don't want it to bring the window to the front when I'm switching between windows
[neutral]	[01:52]	<RobotBanana>	nibsa1242b: I just want it to remember settings for a certain network.
[neutral]	[01:52]	<aro>	Fasma, mp3 format is not free, therefore it cannot be packaged in the default install, you have to install mp3 support after
[negative]	[01:52]	<Cryoniq>	Right now I got it working fine after uninstalled the amd package and the ati package, then the propriatary driver started working very nice.. but cannot still (!) start compiz etc.
[neutral]	[01:52]	<Megaqwerty>	dmandell: using Alt+Tab?
[negative]	[01:52]	<dmandell>	"Megaqwerty: In the Application Switcher settings I unchecked ""Bring to front"", but that doesn't seem to do anything."
[positive]	[01:52]	<kibble>	bluebanana: just run it again, usually when I see that and I haven't closed the upgrade window it's because you need to reboot or something before it can complete the file upgrade
[negative]	[01:52]	<dmandell>	Megaqwerty: that's right.
[neutral]	[01:52]	<otzi48>	 8-)
[negative]	[01:52]	<nibsa1242b>	RobotBanana: I imagine you can, either with config files or scripts. But I wouldn't know how. I would figure the simplest way would be through the DHCP server if you have access.
[negative]	[01:52]	<Cryoniq>	sorry under Gutsy..
[positive]	[01:52]	<Megaqwerty>	dmandell: I'll check it out.
[negative]	[01:53]	<RobotBanana>	Hmm... Alright, thanks nibsa1242b.
[negative]	[01:53]	<darkzero>	<eugo>You know why when I play a ogn video file, it show it big on my monitor?
[negative]	[01:53]	<kibble>	bluebanana: well not reboot, but sometimes like upgrading dpkg before you can install some new ones, it doesn't do it all at once it will do a partial

[positive]	[01:53]	<dmandell>	Megaqwerty:  Thanks, I just updated from Feisty to Gutsy today and it's driving me a bit batty.
[negative]	[01:53]	<Fasma>	aro: do you know an easy way to install mp3 support for a live-cd run of Ubuntu 7.10?
[negative]	[01:53]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: on most ATI hardware you have to install xgl-server to get compiz to work. Esp. if yo use the proprietray driver.
[negative]	[01:53]	<arjones85>	"i have an interesting issue hopefully somebody can help me with. for some reason the mouse pointer is grey when I choose ""clearglass"" under appearance settings on laptop A, but white when I choose ""clearglass"" on laptop B.

[negative]	[01:54]	<numus>	if i am in terminal on the live cd

[negative]	[01:55]	<dmandell>	Megaqwerty:  Maybe I'm misunderstanding the way it's supposed to behave?
[negative]	[01:55]	<RobotBanana>	Also, does anyone know what to do to stop the scroll pad on a laptop from switching between desktops? I can't find the setting... :|
[negative]	[01:55]	<Megaqwerty>	dmandell: possibly, what do you expect it to do?

[neutral]	[01:56]	<dmandell>	 Megaqwerty: What I'm seeing is as I switch from one program to the next (while continuing to hold down alt) the program that I've select pops up in the background.
[positive]	[01:56]	<Cryoniq>	nibsa1242b: and when I do... then my gnome is super slow suddenly.. windows update visibly, distortions and leftovers of windows after moved them.. and.. compiz refuse to work anyway with message..

[negative]	[02:06]	<VousDeux>	I know gnome users don't like to look like windows, but I purposely dressed mine up to look as much like vista as possible because I am going to have to use it in a presentation and I don't want to have to deal with people saying they like the looks of vista better
[negative]	[02:06]	<kevinO>	hydrogen so i create a logical partition in the extended? or should I just create a primary to begin with
[neutral]	[02:06]	<Cryoniq>	Arenlor: I had but it cripples the graphics at once and compiz wont start anyway telling me missing composite..
[neutral]	[02:06]	<hydrogen>	kevinO: you would create a logical partition in the extended.. .I think

[neutral]	[02:06]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: I recommend you try to get support for the open source driver as it used to work for you. At least if there is a bug in the open source driver, someone can fix it.
[negative]	[02:06]	<hydrogen>	so you may want to get a second opinion
[neutral]	[02:06]	<kevinO>	can i just create a primary?

[negative]	[02:07]	<Cryoniq>	nibsa1242b: already tried that.. doesn't work either. as soon xserver-glx enters.. it is screwed
[negative]	[02:07]	<hydrogen>	kevinO: you can only have a total of four partitions.. so if you have three or less now then you can create a primary

[positive]	[02:08]	<VousDeux>	garu_: the vista look is very popular

[negative]	[02:15]	<Arenlor>	tux so you have fglrx installed and xserver-xgl installed?
[negative]	[02:15]	<Kelley>	nibsa1242b: Yeah, definetly. Do you have any recomendations for creating a clone?
[negative]	[02:15]	<MattJ>	fant: Type nm-applet in terminal, and see if it prints any errors
[negative]	[02:15]	<tux97>	does anyone know how come rymbox wont play songs from a ipod?
[negative]	[02:15]	<kevinO>	fant i dont know why its not there, i just started using the applet one
[neutral]	[02:15]	<kevinO>	its nicer
[negative]	[02:15]	<garu_>	"Cryoniq try doing that in the terminal!""sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl""!"
[neutral]	[02:15]	<Kelley>	nibsa1242b: Haha, right now the drive itself in thereis a 160gb
[negative]	[02:15]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: I'm known to be somewhat dyslexic so I may have glx as xgl when you said it. I'm sure I typed xgl though.
[neutral]	[02:15]	<fant>	mattj:  it moves to the next line, but doesnt do or start anything
[neutral]	[02:15]	<tux>	Arenlor: no I have the restricted drivers on (or is that it?)
[negative]	[02:15]	<hschroy>	i just network upgraded to 7.10 on my VAIO - 7.04 was very stable, but now when the machine goes idle, it displays a login prompt upon 'waking' and then freezes up - the screen goes black and displays some messages about usb...

[neutral]	[02:15]	<garu_>	Cryoniq I think u need to enable ur restricted drivers and the system has to be up-to-date
[positive]	[02:16]	<Cryoniq>	nibsa1242b: I typed it wrong.. a lot :)
[negative]	[02:16]	<Kelley>	nibsa1242b: I tried clonezilla, but the interface stumped me and I was really scared I was going to screw things up big time
[negative]	[02:16]	<kibble>	martman: yeah virtual package that's what I was trying to say, I know I always had lots of trouble with debian when i tried to force stuff in because they had stupid deps, I suppose it's possible

[negative]	[02:16]	<Arenlor>	"tux please turn on your restricted drivers if there are any and ""sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl"""

[neutral]	[02:17]	<MattJ>	fant: Moves to the next line, and prints fant@blah-desktop:~$, or just blank on the new line?
[negative]	[02:17]	<fant>	mattj :  blank
[negative]	[02:17]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: I'm told that partimage will create a true clone. I tried it once and it didn't like me. It made the file fine, but yelled at me when I wanted to restore.
[negative]	[02:17]	<Cryoniq>	garu_: could it be a problem the drivers are isntalled.. I mean maybe it goes wrong if installing fglrx before xserver-xgl, than other way around?
[negative]	[02:17]	<numus>	please i am having a huge problem with nvidia can someone help me
[neutral]	[02:17]	<garu_>	Cryoniq then try that in the terminal, u wont lose anything.lol
[neutral]	[02:17]	<MattJ>	fant: Which would indicate that it is running... odd
[negative]	[02:17]	<Jaggs>	OK I am real real new and was wondering if someone in here could help me out a little
[positive]	[02:17]	<garu_>	VousDeux no problem :)!
[negative]	[02:17]	<fant>	mattj:  i agree, but its not on my bar at all
[neutral]	[02:17]	<Yowsers>	does VMWare Server work on 7.10 yet?
[positive]	[02:17]	<Cryoniq>	garu_: just my sanity.. been trying for 8 hours or so now.. probably 10 :D

[negative]	[02:19]	<Cryoniq>	garu_: hmm yeah.. this one is installed from the desktop iso..
[negative]	[02:19]	<Kelley>	kibble: Ok, thanks. Does that copy all of the empty blocks though? I want to copy the 90gb of data onto a 92gb partition, but the source drive itself is 155gb
[negative]	[02:20]	<tux>	Arenlor: still doesn't work
[neutral]	[02:20]	<silent_>	joely_, if you need help compiling just ask

[negative]	[02:20]	<mmdski>	is it possible to run 32bit ubuntu on a 64bit processor?
[neutral]	[02:20]	<PriceChild>	mmdski, yes
[neutral]	[02:20]	<silent_>	mmdski, yes
[negative]	[02:20]	<kibble>	Kelley: it will yes, it will raw copy everything, not files, just the whole file system, since you don't know where it ends I don't think dd would be a good choice

[neutral]	[02:20]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: kibble gave a decent example... I prefer to pipe it to gzip or bzip so it zips up while its running... it works, but its slow. It makes a byte for byte copy of everything including freespace. Partimage is basically a gui interface to special uses of dd, but like I said I had issues with it... that was over a year ago though
[neutral]	[02:20]	<Arenlor>	dga did you install that? if so go to System > Preferences > Appearance > Visual Effects and choose custom
[neutral]	[02:20]	<Jaggs>	I dont think so

[neutral]	[02:20]	<f|shy>	yes, so long as it isnt an itanium......
[negative]	[02:20]	<JensenDied>	kibble: any idea where they threw the compiz config stuff?
[neutral]	[02:20]	<element>	anyone know how to fix it?
[neutral]	[02:21]	<silent_>	mmdski, 64 bit cpus are backward compatible... you can run any 32 bit OS on a 64 bit processor
[negative]	[02:21]	<scrottles>	how does one un-ignore a repo?
[neutral]	[02:21]	<scrottles>	Ign @HLINK feisty-security/restricted Translation-en_US
[neutral]	[02:21]	<Cryoniq>	what is difference between desktop iso and alternate iso?

[positive]	[02:21]	<Arenlor>	tux what visual drivers are installed by the Restricted Drivers Manager?
[positive]	[02:21]	<silent_>	mmdski, with the right utilities you can also run 32 bit programs on a 64 bit os
[neutral]	[02:21]	<scrottles>	that line came from apt-get update
[negative]	[02:21]	<Lifeisfunny>	I get stuff like compiz with no way to modify the settings ........ I would like to go back to compiz where I have some control over it.
[negative]	[02:21]	<kibble>	JensenDied: gnome-compiz-manager or something, it's been pasted a few times
[neutral]	[02:21]	<Jaggs>	dell 1390 ... I think
[neutral]	[02:21]	<silent_>	Lifeisfunny, the options are in appearance
[neutral]	[02:21]	<mmdski>	silent_, what utilities would these be?
[neutral]	[02:21]	<Arenlor>	compizconfig-settings-manager kibble, JensenDied
[neutral]	[02:21]	<kibble>	Jaggs: wireless card? broadcom, it's pretty well suppored
[neutral]	[02:21]	<tux>	Arenlor: ATI accelerated graphics driver
[negative]	[02:21]	<kibble>	yeah what he said
[negative]	[02:22]	<JensenDied>	kibble: alright, one would think compiz-manager-gnome since thats the package name
[neutral]	[02:22]	<element>	when i turn on compiz effects, my titlebar dissapears anyone know how to fix it?
[positive]	[02:22]	<Jaggs>	the kind that they put in this POS computer :)
[negative]	[02:22]	<Kelley>	kibble and nibsa1242b: Hmm... Well I guess I should do a dd copy but how could I copy directly from the internal partition to the external USB drive?
[neutral]	[02:22]	<Lifeisfunny>	silent, there are no options to keep it from zooming

[negative]	[02:22]	<Fasma>	well, sorry, Ubuntu is fine but not yet ready for prime time, I was a tech-geek years ago but by now I would expect anyone and everyone to put usability in a higher priority than anything ese
[positive]	[02:22]	<silent_>	mmdski, can't remember the name of the package. It's needed to run flash/java for 64 bit... but if you're new to ubuntu, I'd strongly recommend you install 32
[neutral]	[02:22]	<Fasma>	else
[neutral]	[02:22]	<dga>	Jaggs: i have the same card
[negative]	[02:22]	<Dumptruck>	what does this mean?
[negative]	[02:22]	<JensenDied>	wait, neither are there...
[negative]	[02:22]	<Jaggs>	Im starting to wonder if it is getting the card but not the signal from the router
[negative]	[02:22]	<Kelley>	Partimage does look easier though...
[negative]	[02:22]	<Arenlor>	"tux run this in a terminal ""sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"" just to make sure"
[neutral]	[02:22]	<Cryoniq>	nibsa1242b:   what is difference between desktop iso and alternate iso?
[negative]	[02:22]	<Fasma>	so, back to that dreary Windows
[negative]	[02:22]	<kibble>	Kelley: yeah dd is really not the right way to go with this one, I would use cp -Ra from-directory to-directory
[negative]	[02:22]	<mmdski>	i'll have to do everything over again...
[neutral]	[02:23]	<silent_>	nibsa1242b, desktop boots a live version, alternate only installs

[negative]	[02:23]	<kibble>	Cryoniq: alt doesn't have a gui install
[negative]	[02:23]	<edubuntu>	Ok is it a dell wiht a broadcom 1390?
[positive]	[02:23]	<silent_>	nibsa1242b, alternate offers more installation options

[negative]	[02:24]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: alternate allows more options, doesn't give you a live cd to work from, you can upgrade from the alternate, and the alternate runs better on slower machines

[positive]	[02:25]	<Kelley>	kibble and nibsa1242b: The command line way of doing it seems abit to complicated for me, so Partimage is looking like the way to go.

[neutral]	[02:26]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: I think so. I think you can mount it as a loopback device. However, you might not be able to do that if you choose to compress the file. (<- unsure about this last point)

[negative]	[02:27]	<Kelley>	kibble and nibsa1242b: Ok, I don't have any need to compress it, so I guess it should work then. I will try and read the image though and make sure it works before partitioning
[neutral]	[02:27]	<kibble>	fant: did you install network-manager?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<silent_>	Jaggs, without the quote
[negative]	[02:27]	<^^wizard^^>	ok, then I'd imagine its either a hardware/driver issue on my end or some problem with instalation getting a lot of lockups and freezes
[negative]	[02:27]	<Arenlor>	adriyel you said about miniLAN being evil? gutsy comes with native drivers that completely suck for it, but they do work
[neutral]	[02:27]	<mark_>	fepoo: I think in the partitioner, you can tell which partitions you format.

[negative]	[02:27]	<tux>	Arenlor: Could that be part of the problem?
[neutral]	[02:27]	<kibble>	fant: did it include the gnome part to?
[negative]	[02:27]	<fepoo>	or will it just update over what packages are there
[negative]	[02:27]	<Arenlor>	tux I have an ATI Radeon too, so not likely
[negative]	[02:27]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: just remember that if you do need to mount the image, do it read only.

[neutral]	[02:35]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: I believe that there is an issue with AGP, the fglrx driver, and any 2.6.x kernel. You need additional drivers for your mobo for it to work.

[neutral]	[02:37]	<minus>	unstable, If I move the connectors to the drives inside my computer, the right drive will be mounted on the same spot anyhow, cause it goes after the UUID and not /dev/ path..

[negative]	[02:40]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: worst case, you'd boot up with the live cd and edit GRUBs config. Other wise, it might just boot you into Ubuntu and then you'd have to setup GRUB to recongize your windows partition as bootable from there. Its not that difficult to do.

[negative]	[02:41]	<tux>	Arenlor: ok it did that. now what?
[negative]	[02:41]	<kevleviathan>	Does anybody know how to disable the internal PC speaker? Mine beeps when I hit, for example, backspace when there's no more characters to delete such as in pidgin

[positive]	[02:43]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: at the least the install will should allow you to boot into Ubuntu. If Grub doesn't have a windows option in the menu its not that difficult to add one. Grub is great. I love being able to have a custom image at boot (I have one of my dogs).
[negative]	[02:43]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: np, hope you get it figured out

[negative]	[02:43]	<XXer>	Could someone give me a hand with this ...This the my first attempt at install a game in linux without the using the (add/remove app). First off im trying to install scourge, It gives me 5 steps to install it which are (1. tar -xzvf scourge-XX.tar.gz
[negative]	[02:43]	<XXer>	2. cd scourge-XX
[neutral]	[02:43]	<XXer>	3. ./configure
[negative]	[02:43]	<XXer>	4. make
[negative]	[02:43]	<XXer>	5. ./src/scourge). Iv done No. 1&2 but now I dont know what No.3  means
[positive]	[02:43]	<tux97>	it shows a red cricle with a white line through it
[negative]	[02:43]	<Pelo>	ThePub,  I suggest you handle it as if you never had two screens before
[negative]	[02:43]	<kevleviathan>	Now problem number 2 is that I can't get my Broadcom wireless to work, anybody have experience setting that up in Gutsy?
[neutral]	[02:44]	<org>	mark_, hi.
[negative]	[02:44]	<Cryoniq>	nibsa1242b: yeah.. otherwize I have a Nvidia GeForce 6200 Turbo Edition in my other box.
[negative]	[02:44]	<tux97>	how do i install a decoder?
[negative]	[02:44]	<clarkey>	" Just a question in Gusty my wireless button on my laptop stopped working, it was in feisty but I have found a command to turn on the wireless only problem is that I have to run it every time I start the laptop is there a file I can put it to run automatically at startup? the command is         echo ""1"" > /proc/driver/acerhk/wirelessled"
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Arenlor>	XXer when you've cd'd there type ./configure
[negative]	[02:44]	<ThePub>	Pelo: that's not really helpful, especially if you're saying give up on dual monitors.
[neutral]	[02:44]	<nibsa1242b>	kevleviathan: which Broadcom card
[neutral]	[02:44]	<etank>	kevleviathan: i think you need ndiswrapper for that
[neutral]	[02:44]	<XXer>	that didnt work
[neutral]	[02:44]	<mark_>	org: ?
[positive]	[02:44]	<Negra>	my AWN and deatop settings manager is not working
[neutral]	[02:44]	<org>	mark_, @HLINK
[negative]	[02:44]	<etank>	kevleviathan: or something called fwcutter (i think that is it)
[neutral]	[02:44]	<funkyb>	ndiswrapper worked for me
[positive]	[02:44]	<Pelo>	XXer,   first you need to install build essential   sudo apt-get install build-essential
[neutral]	[02:44]	<tux97>	mp3
[neutral]	[02:44]	<Cryoniq>	err TurboForce edition.. ^^
[negative]	[02:45]	<kevleviathan>	etank: i've tried installing that (successfully), and I go into restricted drivers and it enables the firmware properly
[positive]	[02:45]	<Kelley>	nibsa1242b: Haha, ok. One last question actually. Right now, when the computer boots up into the Windows partition after the bios, I see a little menu that has two options. One for Windows XP and the other for Windows XP recovery console or something like that. Is that on the Master Boot Record? Will that get screwed up at all? I know the recovery console does not have its own partition
[negative]	[02:45]	<icon>	I'm getting this error when trying to run restricted-manager: @HLINK
[neutral]	[02:45]	<kevleviathan>	however, once I reboot, it stops working

[negative]	[02:45]	<nibsa1242b>	Cryoniq: my understanding is that support for Nvidia cards is much better then ATI currently. However, there is supposed to be an official open ATI driver coming out soon.
[neutral]	[02:45]	<element>	wow lol
[negative]	[02:45]	<element>	compiz sucks
[neutral]	[02:45]	<martyvis>	XXer: you may need to run autogen.sh first - read the INSTALL file (or README) for instructions
[neutral]	[02:45]	<Arenlor>	element in what way?
[neutral]	[02:45]	<element>	titlebar dissapeared
[positive]	[02:45]	<Cryoniq>	nibsa1242b: I experience it like that also. Yeah.. I heard there is one on the way.. :)
[negative]	[02:45]	<element>	and terminal is just a white screen
[neutral]	[02:45]	<coz_>	element, nvidia card?
[negative]	[02:45]	<element>	yeah
[negative]	[02:45]	<Pelo>	element, candy rots your teeth, eye candy does it to your brain
[positive]	[02:46]	<kevleviathan>	Weird thing is that as soon as I enable the firmware, the light turns on (the hardware LED) but shortly after turns off. The card shows up in network properties until I reboot, where it goes away
[negative]	[02:46]	<coz_>	element, did you do nvidia-xconfig --add-argb-glx-visuals -d 24
[negative]	[02:46]	<Arenlor>	Pelo, my college is bad for students if that's true
[negative]	[02:46]	<Pelo>	element,  that's just a decorator issue ask in #ubuntu-effect and they will tell you how to fix it
[neutral]	[02:46]	<funkyb>	ok - I use conky and compiz in gusty.  When I load conky from terminal everything is great.  When conky loads on startup, compiz puts shadows on the conky window and the window is not 'underneith' all other windows, like it is when I run from terminal (after killing the startup instance)
[negative]	[02:46]	<element>	yeah
[positive]	[02:46]	<IcemanV9>	Pelo: ha. well put. :)
[negative]	[02:46]	<nibsa1242b>	Kelley: I don't know. It doesn't sound like an mbr thing to me. It sounds like a windows thing, and should probably be fine.
[negative]	[02:46]	<XXer>	Ok thanks Ill give thoes a try THanks
[negative]	[02:46]	<coz_>	element, and  which nvidia card and driver are you using
[positive]	[02:46]	<tux>	Arenlor: its kind of working now. I wan't compiz fusion now :D

If I set my network connect to DHCP my browser and email fail to work. but IRC and chat works just fine.

[negative]	[03:08]	<Kelley>	mark_: No, I need it to be just an image file that I can restore to if something goes wrong, but if there is a way to be able to use it as a live file system, that would be good to.
[negative]	[03:08]	<mark_>	nibsa1242b: when you try the instructions at @HLINK what goes wrong?
[negative]	[03:08]	<warbler>	allobjects: the option should be there at the grub menu during boot
[neutral]	[03:08]	<RoC_MasterMind>	ader10, you got me...I'm not sure if that's possible.

[neutral]	[03:08]	<RoC_MasterMind>	ader10, that's why I think it's best to stick with 32-bit for the foreseeable future.  A lot of software is 32-bit only.

[neutral]	[03:09]	<paradizelost>	NemesisD: this is why we do multiple partitions, and only format the system partition
[negative]	[03:09]	<RoC_MasterMind>	biggahed, what does the 2nd line of free -m say?
[positive]	[03:09]	<paradizelost>	;)
[positive]	[03:09]	<ader10>	RoC_MasterMind: I guess I can use 32 bit if there's no other option, but I think it would be nice to see some blender render times go down a little :P
[negative]	[03:09]	<Kelley>	mark_: Yes, I am trying to back up my windows drive. I have an external USB drive about exactly the same size as the drive I am trying to clone
[neutral]	[03:09]	<K3nto>	MenZa: @HLINK
[negative]	[03:09]	<wastrel>	oxeimon: you have to set the label to  /  on the partition you want to use as your root partition
[neutral]	[03:09]	<Lerris>	i have amd64 running, and other than a graphics card stability issue, which is likely the nvidia driver, and a dvd writer issue, all seems well

[negative]	[03:10]	<DanMulvey>	is there any advantage right now to going with the 64 bit distro?
[negative]	[03:10]	<Kelley>	mark_: However, the drive I want to clone has two partitions, one is a 5gb recovery made by HP, and the other is Windows itself.

[neutral]	[03:10]	<racarter>	back
[negative]	[03:10]	<mark_>	Kelley, 'dd' may work, with a syntax similiar to this: @HLINK    Because it's so low level, it really doesn't care much about the file system.
[neutral]	[03:10]	<racarter>	my sound card is not working...
[negative]	[03:11]	<NemesisD>	paradizelost, so is it most likely that these left unconfigured errors will just ruin the system?
[neutral]	[03:11]	<racarter>	and i dont know how to fix it
[neutral]	[03:11]	<MenZa>	K3nto: Could you try creating a directory for test mounting, e.g. /media/wintest? (sudo mkdir /media/wintest)
[neutral]	[03:11]	<oxeimon>	"wastrel: Right now the mount point is ""/media/sda2"""

[positive]	[03:11]	<geirha>	Smegzor: you can add the cd as a repository, but most of the packages will still be downloaded from the net afaik
[neutral]	[03:11]	<MenZa>	Yes, thedefender
[neutral]	[03:11]	<jimmacdonald>	anyone?
[negative]	[03:11]	<nibsa1242b>	Burlynn: the problem is I can't seem to find a more up to date link
[neutral]	[03:11]	<mark_>	Kelley: another option may be creating a dual boot system (at least for now) and leaving Windows intact for a bit.
[negative]	[03:11]	<Kelley>	mark_: Yeah, thats probably a good idea. In fact, I may just abandon the idea of cloning the drive in the first place. Cloning seems abit complicated for me right now
[neutral]	[03:11]	<paradizelost>	thedefender: gutsy is final, so yes
[neutral]	[03:11]	<Burlynn>	nibsa1242b, same here
[neutral]	[03:11]	<racarter>	sound card?
[negative]	[03:11]	<biggahed>	RoC_MasterMind, it is the second line, if you count the labels like total used etc. Is this what you meant? -/+ buffers/cache:        859       1154

[negative]	[03:12]	<Kelley>	mark_: Yeah, thats what I am planning on doing. I just want to have my Backup incase the partitioner screws up my disk
[neutral]	[03:12]	<|neon|>	eugo: you need lm sensors then you can use like ksensors if kde and for gnom eii dunno
[negative]	[03:12]	<racarter>	can i use dmesg to find out what kind of sound card i have?

[neutral]	[03:12]	<MenZa>	racarter: lspci
[negative]	[03:12]	<paradizelost>	XXer: read the README file in the folder
[neutral]	[03:12]	<wastrel>	oxeimon: that's probably where it mounted for th e install process ?  i haven't done the gusty installer
[negative]	[03:12]	<thedefender>	i am running the beta, and have not received any updates since it was made final, or 2 days prior to it being made final
[negative]	[03:12]	<paradizelost>	racarter: either dmesg or lspci
[neutral]	[03:12]	<wastrel>	racarter: try lspci
[negative]	[03:12]	<mark_>	Kelley, ask the user about the critical doucments and files they care about... and maybe do a special export of e-mail. Often, the files people are really care about are a fraction the size of the whole drive.
[negative]	[03:12]	<thedefender>	is this something to do with the repos
[neutral]	[03:12]	<MenZa>	K3nto: Right, now try sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda2 /media/wintest && ls /media/wintest
[negative]	[03:12]	<nibsa1242b>	ok, I feel dumb, but now everytime I hit a key to type in this window my internal pc speaker is beeping. how do I turn that off?
[negative]	[03:13]	<racarter>	i am pretty sure the sound card is built into the system board
[negative]	[03:13]	<numus>	paradizelost: any idea?
[negative]	[03:13]	<Kelley>	mark_: Yeah, its really my Mom and Dads computer. All they really care about is their iTunes library, documents and quicken
[negative]	[03:13]	<racarter>	i dont know if lspci says anything about sound.. i am not seeing it right now
[neutral]	[03:13]	<paradizelost>	numus: about?
[negative]	[03:13]	<RoC_MasterMind>	biggahed, yeah the first number on the 2nd line is how much it's using.  the first line is actual physical use, which should be as close to using all of your RAM as possible.  My system uses 292 MB of RAM right now...yours looks like 859MB...which is a lot.
[negative]	[03:13]	<K3nto>	MenZa: ok, i can see SOME of the folders that were on my C drive, but some are missing. uh-oh lol
[negative]	[03:13]	<numus>	paradizelost: why my video card isn't working
[negative]	[03:13]	<Lerris>	if you want to backup a drive, i tend to use something like 'tar cfvz backup.tar.gz .' when in the directory to be backed up
[negative]	[03:13]	<paradizelost>	Kelley: then you probably want to dualboot
[positive]	[03:13]	<mark_>	Kelley: And email. :) (unless htey have web-based email)
[neutral]	[03:13]	<paradizelost>	numus: did you say you ARE running an 8800 series?
[neutral]	[03:14]	<numus>	paradizelost:  no 5500
[negative]	[03:14]	<MenZa>	K3nto: Ubuntu shouldn't have changed anything, unless you specifically told it to.
[neutral]	[03:14]	<Lerris>	or alternatively have that backup file on your removable drive.
[negative]	[03:14]	<paradizelost>	numus: then i couldn't tell ya atm
[negative]	[03:14]	<XXer>	There is no readme file
[negative]	[03:14]	<mark_>	Kelley: I switched my dad (age 60) to Linux and Gmail from Windows and AOL. He's sticking with it.  It can work!
[positive]	[03:14]	<racarter>	i am very impressed with gnome so far by the way
[neutral]	[03:14]	<MenZa>	K3nto: try sudo umount /dev/sda2 && sudo mount /dev/sda3 -t ntfs /media/wintest && ls /media/wintest
[negative]	[03:14]	<K3nto>	MenZa: I could have lol. anyway, lets continue. i backed up important things
[negative]	[03:14]	<numus>	paradizelost: when i use the nvidia drivers.. and restart x it goes to the vesa drivers
[negative]	[03:14]	<IntuitiveNipple>	"Kelley: if the drives are the same size (I think you said), then open a terminal (Applications/Accessories) and then do ""dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY"" (where X & Y are your internal and external drives) - this will copy the *entire* drive image including Master Boot Record and partition table, and all partitions"
[negative]	[03:14]	<paradizelost>	XXer: what is this that you are trying to get support for here?
[neutral]	[03:14]	<paradizelost>	what program?
[neutral]	[03:14]	<racarter>	looks nice... i still hate that toolbar on the top of the screen though
[negative]	[03:14]	<thedefender>	i am running the beta, and have not received any updates since it was made final, or 2 days prior to it being made final
[neutral]	[03:14]	<racarter>	i always end up taking it off
[positive]	[03:14]	<mark_>	Kelley: What will you replace Quicken with?
[negative]	[03:14]	<thedefender>	is this something to do with the repos
[neutral]	[03:15]	<racarter>	where do i find the adobe acrobat reader plugin?
[negative]	[03:15]	<MenZa>	thedefender: Your machine should be pretty much up to date; the packages are made available whenever they're done.
[positive]	[03:15]	<paradizelost>	racarter: kubuntu may meet your wishes then. ;)
[positive]	[03:15]	<biggahed>	RoC_MasterMind, thats exactly what i thought :) And im not even have tons of apps open
[negative]	[03:15]	<Kelley>	mark_: Yeah, my dads abit older but pretty computer literate. Its just that his windows disk got so screwed up that instead of reinstalling windows, I will just have him use Ubuntu most of the time
[negative]	[03:15]	<IntuitiveNipple>	"Kelley: You can also use dd to image individual partitions using ""dd if=/dev/sdX? of=/dev/sdY?"" (where ? are the internal and external partition numbers)"

[neutral]	[03:16]	<CaBlGuY>	!VCD
[negative]	[03:16]	<MenZa>	ok, K3nto, would you say the first one seemed like your C drive?
[neutral]	[03:16]	<thedefender>	MenZa: so then the original repos in the will provided the final updates
[negative]	[03:16]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about vcd - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[03:16]	<Kelley>	IntuitiveNipple: So using the first of those commands would let me copy everything? Thats another good option. Thanks
[positive]	[03:16]	<racarter>	i have a question about ntfs too.. i have a lot of questions today actually
[neutral]	[03:16]	<CaBlGuY>	Hmmmm
[negative]	[03:16]	<paradizelost>	arghh2d2: from a livecd, yes, not if you are booted into the system you are trying to do it on
[neutral]	[03:16]	<IntuitiveNipple>	mark_: It is below the level of the file-system within the partitions - it is at the block-device (aka disk) level

[neutral]	[03:17]	<RoC_MasterMind>	biggahed, it will let you sort by memory usage

[negative]	[03:17]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Kelley: You could have him use Ubuntu all the time and use the QEMU emulator to run a Windows image to host Quicken
[negative]	[03:17]	<RoC_MasterMind>	biggahed, 64-bit code might use more ram.

[negative]	[03:19]	<mark_>	flick: or you can use synaptic.

[negative]	[03:20]	<arghh2d2>	hmmm, let me rephrase that, After resizing and creating a new ext2 part, i intend to put  the 7.10 iso on it  and boot it using my 7.4's grub installation, is this possible?
[positive]	[03:20]	<NemesisD>	wow this is wonderful
[negative]	[03:20]	<theacolyte>	and by php not working, I mean it asks me to download the file
[negative]	[03:20]	<biggahed>	RoC_MasterMind, for the mem usage... firefox is king(as usual) but its not that much, just 123 of resident mem. its more like all the other apps are using a hell lot more ram
[positive]	[03:20]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Kelley: Wine *may* do it but you'd need to check the compatibility lists, and for something so important I'd rather not risk financial data :p
[negative]	[03:20]	<NemesisD>	so glad i decided to upgrade :|
[neutral]	[03:20]	<mark_>	Kelley: Quicken in Wine might work. appdb.winehq.org and codeweavers.com have good WINE compatibility databases.
[neutral]	[03:20]	<MenZa>	theacolyte: you're missing an apache module
[negative]	[03:20]	<K3nto>	MenZa: yeah i think i messed something up with Gparted. I only have two folders in my program files...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<NemesisD>	now i get to spend my friday evening fixing my computer
[negative]	[03:20]	<MenZa>	K3nto: hmm
[neutral]	[03:20]	<MenZa>	K3nto: ow
[neutral]	[03:20]	<racarter>	i need help with my sound card on ubuntu 7.10...
[neutral]	[03:20]	<MenZa>	@HLINK <- theacolyte
[neutral]	[03:20]	<MenZa>	!sound | racarter
[negative]	[03:20]	<ubotu>	racarter: If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3
[negative]	[03:20]	<theacolyte>	MenZa: you would figure, right? But I'm not sure what I could be missing by installing  libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-common php5-curl php5-dev php5-gd php5-idn php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-json php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php5-mhash php5-ming php5-mysql
[negative]	[03:20]	<Kelley>	mark_ and IntuitiveNipple: Ok, I will definetly check that out. Thanks alot for your help!
[positive]	[03:21]	<paradizelost>	NemesisD: you didn't have anything to do did you ? ;)
[neutral]	[03:21]	<Kelley>	Bye!
[neutral]	[03:21]	<paradizelost>	!LAMP
[neutral]	[03:21]	<NemesisD>	oh awesome
[positive]	[03:21]	<ubotu>	LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  @HLINK - See also the Server CD installation process (different in Edgy+)
[negative]	[03:21]	<MenZa>	theacolyte: Kinda obvious, but try restarting apache.
[negative]	[03:21]	<NemesisD>	and then the update manager just closes
[neutral]	[03:21]	<theacolyte>	MenZa: already did
[neutral]	[03:21]	<NemesisD>	says it can't get an exclusive lock
[negative]	[03:21]	<jlilly>	anyone found a solution for dual monitor setups being shown as one screen? nvidia-settings errors saying I'm not using their driver (but I am) and its rather frustrating.
[negative]	[03:21]	<MenZa>	theacolyte: hmm, that's odd.
[neutral]	[03:21]	<paradizelost>	!lamp | theacolyte
[neutral]	[03:21]	<mark_>	Bye Kelley. Good luck!

[negative]	[03:21]	<Kiron>	somebody already installed the SNMP in ubuntu?
[neutral]	[03:21]	<MenZa>	K3nto: Does it mount, though?
[positive]	[03:22]	<K3nto>	MenZa: so that DID work to show me all the contents on my windows partition, right? if thats the case, then ill just reformat and put fresh installs of both windows and ubuntu
[negative]	[03:22]	<K3nto>	MenZa: yeah, its mounted
[positive]	[03:22]	<theacolyte>	paradizelost: I know what I'm doing -- a bot isn't going to help me though I appreciate the effort
[negative]	[03:22]	<MenZa>	Yep, that's correct, K3nto
[neutral]	[03:22]	<paradizelost>	!snmp | kiron
[negative]	[03:22]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about snmp - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[03:22]	<IntuitiveNipple>	NemesisD: any other software package managers running (that's the usual reason for that error) ?
[positive]	[03:22]	<MenZa>	Why do you want to reinstall Ubuntu? :)
[negative]	[03:22]	<codeshah>	hey guys - i am using ie6 on wine ... and I am wondering if I can run activex controls in ubuntu?
[negative]	[03:22]	<K3nto>	MenZa: i guess it is anyway. should it show up on my desktop?
[negative]	[03:22]	<slaytanic>	After installing Ubuntu I get a black screen while booting instead of a pretty loading thingie like on the livecd, is something broken or is it supposed to be this way?
[negative]	[03:22]	<paradizelost>	theacolyte: did you follow the howto word for word?
[negative]	[03:22]	<NemesisD>	IntuitiveNipple, not a single other thing was running but the update manager
[negative]	[03:22]	<MenZa>	K3nto: Erf, I'm not sure.
[neutral]	[03:22]	<racarter>	my sound doesnt work is not really a question..
[negative]	[03:22]	<MenZa>	K3nto: I don't display my volumes on my desktop
[neutral]	[03:22]	<zetheroo>	I have a couple problems with the new Gutsy
[negative]	[03:22]	<Kiron>	somebody already installed the SNMP in ubuntu?
[negative]	[03:22]	<theacolyte>	paradizelost: forward and back though I hardly need a howto, this seems more like a bug than anything -- plugging away with it and asking advice in here
[negative]	[03:23]	<Vlet>	slaytanic: Does the login screen eventually load?
[negative]	[03:23]	<IntuitiveNipple>	NemesisD: Has it run more than once at that point? It could have left a lock-file behind if it terminated abnormally previously
[negative]	[03:23]	<theacolyte>	I've only done this a million times
[negative]	[03:23]	<slyder>	why when i'm installing packages in synaptic does it keep asking me to insert my gutsy dvd?
[neutral]	[03:23]	<zetheroo>	for one my logoff sound does not happen anymore
[neutral]	[03:23]	<dave___>	hey im upgrading to gutsy now and i keep getting errors
[negative]	[03:23]	<jlilly>	zetheroo: me too. Dual head support isn't working very well.
[neutral]	[03:23]	<dave___>	anyone else gteing them
[negative]	[03:23]	<K3nto>	MenZa: k. I want to put vista back on though, simply for the compatability of games. Ill get started on that then..
[positive]	[03:23]	<paradizelost>	theacolyte: a few versions of apache ago, they moved to multiple config files, rather than everything in the httpd.conf
[negative]	[03:23]	<K3nto>	MenZa: alright, thanks for your help!!
[positive]	[03:23]	<MenZa>	slyder: Because your DVD is set as a repository :)
[negative]	[03:23]	<NemesisD>	IntuitiveNipple, i tried to run it at school today but i closed it and shut down the computer, so i don't think that could be it
[neutral]	[03:23]	<dave___>	"cannot install ""xxx"" due to dependency errors"
[neutral]	[03:23]	<zetheroo>	jlilly: Dual Head?

[neutral]	[03:23]	<mpeters>	hello there
[negative]	[03:23]	<Vlet>	slyder: in your 'software sources' admin control, unckeck the dvd at the bottom
[neutral]	[03:23]	<theacolyte>	paradizelost: I'm aware of it, thanks though -- this is something else
[neutral]	[03:23]	<theacolyte>	I'll keep chugging at it
[neutral]	[03:23]	<dave___>	leaving unconfigured
[neutral]	[03:23]	<jlilly>	zetheroo: two monitors
[neutral]	[03:23]	<MenZa>	You can disable it in your list of repositories in Synaptic, slyder, as Vlet says.
[negative]	[03:23]	<slaytanic>	Vlet: It's just that I get a black screen until gdm loads.
[neutral]	[03:23]	<dave___>	am i screwed?
[positive]	[03:23]	<theacolyte>	Gonna need to fork this channel :P
[negative]	[03:23]	<oxeimon>	should I make my swap partition a logical or primary partition? I have 2GB of RAM, how large should I make my swap partition?
[neutral]	[03:23]	<slyder>	thanks gonna do that now found this very annoying didn't do this with feisty fawn
[positive]	[03:24]	<slyder>	thanks menza and vlet
[negative]	[03:24]	<zetheroo>	jlilly: yeah..... I have a Laptop and an LCD pluged into the VGA port....

[positive]	[03:24]	<NemesisD>	ok i just rebooted and it took me to the login prompt and now im just sitting at a light blue screen :)
[negative]	[03:24]	<Vlet>	slaytanic: you're the second person I've heard have this problem... it must have something to do with your monitor/video configuartion combination
[negative]	[03:24]	<mpeters>	anyone know where i can go to disable the pc speaker?  also wondering if there's a way around the new 64mb restriction i'm running into with compiz fusion
[negative]	[03:24]	<element>	hey guys
[neutral]	[03:24]	<MenZa>	herro
[negative]	[03:24]	<zetheroo>	jlilly: the LCD can only fire at 1024x768... thats its manufacturer max res.......
[negative]	[03:24]	<slaytanic>	Vlet: So, I _am_ supposed to be seeing something, right?
[negative]	[03:24]	<biggahed>	so... does anyone have a clue?
[neutral]	[03:24]	<Vlet>	slaytanic: yes
[negative]	[03:24]	<jlilly>	zetheroo: what problem are you having? Mine is that they both combine into a 2056x1024 resolution instead of 2 at 1280x1024
[negative]	[03:24]	<mpeters>	it's muted in volume control. not sure what else i could be missing

[positive]	[03:25]	<Vlet>	biggahed: if it's been a while since you asked your question, you may want to re-ask.. within reason :)
[negative]	[03:25]	<jlilly>	zetheroo: give me a second. Going to try to restart X
[negative]	[03:25]	<tomd123>	element, it should detect it and automatically mount it. Just plug it in.
[negative]	[03:25]	<zetheroo>	jlilly: ok
[neutral]	[03:25]	<funkyb>	anyone have hte brightness backwards on their lappy?  when I plug in the AC, screen auto-dims, when I unplug and run on battery, screen auto brightens.

[neutral]	[03:26]	<gonk23>	mpeters: have u tried System->Sound->SystemBeep and untick Enable System Beep?
[neutral]	[03:26]	<dga>	does rhythmbox have an equalizer?
[negative]	[03:26]	<mark_>	"org: I suspect that's a ""feature"" of desktop effects"
[negative]	[03:26]	<Vlet>	"org: it's not a bug, it's ""better""... the desktop only transparence was just the way it was because of a lack of hardware acceleration"
[neutral]	[03:26]	<B_166-ER-X>	is there a way to config the 'compiz' desktop ? like in Beryl ?
[negative]	[03:26]	<theacolyte>	ah wait, I think I see it -- odd
[positive]	[03:26]	<paradizelost>	org: generally true transparency shows what's actualy underneath it
[negative]	[03:26]	<theacolyte>	must be a broken package
[negative]	[03:26]	<funkyb>	org, mine is slightly transparent.  it's in the cube effects
[negative]	[03:26]	<element>	btw what IRC software are you using
[positive]	[03:26]	<IntuitiveNipple>	funkyb: check the brightness settings in System > Preferences > Power Management for each
[negative]	[03:26]	<mpeters>	gonk23: that would have been far too bloody obvious
[neutral]	[03:26]	<Vlet>	element: irssi
[positive]	[03:26]	<mpeters>	thank you very much :)
[positive]	[03:26]	<funkyb>	enable desktop cube, go into it's settings, you can set the normal and cube transparency levels

[neutral]	[03:27]	<wastrel>	Negra: network monitor or network-manager ?
[positive]	[03:27]	<org>	yeah I know... but sometime i have terminal and underneath it is an Xchat. then words are into each other. How do you manage that? give me some screenshots of yours let me get an idea!!! :) pls
[negative]	[03:27]	<IntuitiveNipple>	oxeimon: If you want to hibernate too, make the swap about 2.25 - 2.5GB. It can be logical or primary.
[positive]	[03:27]	<Negra>	wastrel: manager

[negative]	[03:28]	<org>	Vlet, I tried. didn't help it
[negative]	[03:28]	<theacolyte>	Wouldn't you expect that you'd see php.load/conf in mods-enabled in apache2 if php installed correctly?
[positive]	[03:28]	<wastrel>	Negra: i think that shows up in the notification area
[neutral]	[03:28]	<biggahed>	B_166-ER-X, custom effects on the desktop effects area

[positive]	[03:29]	<funkyb>	np, happy to help.
[negative]	[03:29]	<trogdor>	mark_: instead of a transparent terminal you can make an unwindowed terminal that is your desktop background currently behind it

[positive]	[03:29]	<trogdor>	mark_: I got something like that for eterm, its like terminal camou or something, very kool :)
[neutral]	[03:30]	<dga>	does anyone use Amarok in GNOME?
[positive]	[03:30]	<B_166-ER-X>	i there a simple way to use Emerald instead of well 'themes for gnome'
[negative]	[03:30]	<Vlet>	org: what do you mean it didn't help... you get to choose between completely transparent, and not transparent at all. if it were not at all transparent, it would be very visible, and full transparency would be hard to read, so if you set it just a little transparent, wouldn't it be pretty easy to read?
[positive]	[03:30]	<arghh2d2>	I have a question: Using the 7.10 install disk, am i going to be able to update the  current system without formatting the whole partition, as in: keep my home directory and settings?
[neutral]	[03:30]	<trogdor>	dga: no I use exaile, songbird, miro, totem, vlc. lots of edumatainment

[positive]	[03:31]	<CowBayPig>	ixian,do you have access to the internet?
[neutral]	[03:31]	<funkyb>	you can apply those techs to do lots of neat things, in addition to trans terms
[negative]	[03:31]	<zetheroo>	arghh2d2: sorry alternate CD
[negative]	[03:31]	<racarter>	what do you call it when you use alt+f1? virtual desktop?
[negative]	[03:31]	<IntuitiveNipple>	arghh2d2: Using the LiveCD Desktop installer, no, the partitions will be formatted *unless* you have a separate partition for /home.
[negative]	[03:31]	<NemesisD>	is there any way to repair a borked gutsy upgrade?
[neutral]	[03:31]	<ixian_>	yes CowBayPig

[negative]	[03:31]	<ixian_>	my router won't even respond to a ping from within linux

[neutral]	[03:31]	<ixian_>	blarg
[neutral]	[03:31]	<Akaishi>	ixian, is the ubuntu machine's IP on the same subnet with the router?
[neutral]	[03:31]	<xblackfire>	is posible update ubuntu(server version) with server cd from the console no graphic mode?
[positive]	[03:31]	<mark_>	arghh2d2: Are you able to upgrade over the network? If possible, I'd  recommend that.
[negative]	[03:31]	<arghh2d2>	Madpilot: zetheroo, sweeet thats what im using, 710 alt server
[negative]	[03:31]	<dga>	trogdor: what do you recommend for just music? i used to use amarok in kubuntu but i'm not so sure i want to run it in gnome.
[negative]	[03:32]	<zetheroo>	arghh2d2: go for it then.....
[negative]	[03:32]	<trogdor>	ixian_: what type of interface and what hardware, is it claimed or disabled/unclaimed in lshw?
[neutral]	[03:32]	<chill>	hey all
[positive]	[03:32]	<zetheroo>	arghh2d2: it will just upgrade your current setup...
[neutral]	[03:32]	<racarter>	or actually alt+f1 brings up the main menu.. other combinations do different things
[neutral]	[03:32]	<flick>	there's a .deb package which is more advanced than the one in current Ubuntu source... any way i can put it in so that it can be downloaded with apt-get?

[positive]	[03:32]	<arghh2d2>	one more question, will i be able to get a command line on grub and direct to boot a harddrive holding the iso?
[negative]	[03:32]	<trogdor>	dga: yeah kde apps have lot of coupled subsystem processes, not good for performance. For music try exaile or songbird. There loads off other apps though too if you search synaptic
[neutral]	[03:32]	<zetheroo>	can someone help me get the splash screen working again???
[negative]	[03:33]	<IntuitiveNipple>	ixian_: It sounds as if the PC didn't get an IP address allocated by the router using DHCP. Have you checked that yet (ifconfig) ?

[negative]	[03:33]	<corevette>	my splash screen doesn't work
[negative]	[03:33]	<addicted68098>	Does the new ubuntu version have a way to save files on a partition that is going to be overwritten durring instalation, I thought I saw something about the other day, but I can't seem to find it
[negative]	[03:33]	<biggahed>	hello there. Im trying gutsy amd64. Is there any 'it sucks huge amounts of ram' issue known?
[negative]	[03:33]	<facugaich>	"flick: if you already have the .deb package you can install it with ""sudo dpkg -i <package-path>"""
[negative]	[03:33]	<TokenBad>	ok in ubuntu a friend installed but his nic card isn't detected...anyone know how to fix?
[neutral]	[03:33]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: when you login there is a Ubuntu splash .... its not happening since I upgraded
[positive]	[03:33]	<GBenemy>	thanks mark_
[negative]	[03:34]	<ixian_>	IntuitiveNipple: should i just paste the output of ifconfig?
[neutral]	[03:34]	<corevette>	zetheroo, same here
[neutral]	[03:34]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: also the log-off sound is not happening
[negative]	[03:34]	<thedukeny>	How can i make it possible to get my monitor to change to 1650 x 1280?
[negative]	[03:34]	<NemesisD>	does anybody know if i can perform some sort of repair installation of a messed up upgrade to gutsy with the gutsy cd?
[positive]	[03:34]	<gonk23>	ixian_: right click the network connections icon in the top-right corner and select Connection Information.  Tell us what the IP address and subnet mask is.
[negative]	[03:34]	<slaytanic>	corevette, zetheroo, same thing here.
[negative]	[03:34]	<zetheroo>	corevette: have you worked out why?
[neutral]	[03:34]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: there are settings for such...
[neutral]	[03:34]	<thedukeny>	Its not giving me that option
[neutral]	[03:34]	<corevette>	zetheroo, not yet
[neutral]	[03:34]	<funkyb>	dunky - i struggled to get 1280x800 for days
[negative]	[03:34]	<funkyb>	it was the EDID not getting detected
[negative]	[03:34]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: well thats the thing.... all the settings are set correctly
[negative]	[03:35]	<funkyb>	setting the xserver config utility manually to 1280x800 (and NOTHING ELSE!) worked for me
[negative]	[03:35]	<IntuitiveNipple>	"ixian_: No... run the command in a terminal, and look for the ""inet addr"" - it should be in your router's range (192.168.x.y)"
[neutral]	[03:35]	<ixian_>	gonk23: my ip address is 192.168.1.103
[negative]	[03:35]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: personally I think the splash is kinda useless since your either don't care what its doing or your watching the screen seeing the systems steps as it boots.
[negative]	[03:35]	<Akaishi>	is there any way I could download some kind of boot image and install it to a hard drive partition, then boot that and install the rest over internet?
[positive]	[03:35]	<slaytanic>	corevette/zetheroo: It works on the livecd? Mine does on the livecd, just not after install.
[neutral]	[03:35]	<corevette>	same slaytanic
[neutral]	[03:35]	<element>	hello
[positive]	[03:35]	<mpeters>	are there any dangers in upgrading from ubuntu gutsy RC to final?
[neutral]	[03:35]	<ixian_>	gonk23: which shouldnt be cause i set it to 192.168.1.5 in the network config
[negative]	[03:35]	<jvon>	if i do an install of gutsy on an already partition drive with dapper will it format the drive?
[negative]	[03:35]	<Gooie>	Hey can I have some help for a first time linux user? I want to know how to make the mouse be faster? I put the scroll bar all the way up for acceleration, and its still really slow!
[neutral]	[03:35]	<mpeters>	I imagine not, but it never hurts to hear the experiences of others
[positive]	[03:35]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: well that may be true.. but nevertheless its a fault...
[negative]	[03:35]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: don't use the main list of settings use the tab settings its hidden in that long list
[neutral]	[03:36]	<element>	my ipod isn't auto mounting
[negative]	[03:36]	<keycool>	I'm sorry I'm very new...can somebody help me get my WPA working on my wireless card?
[negative]	[03:36]	<funkyb>	akaishi:  maybe this? -> @HLINK
[negative]	[03:36]	<gonk23>	ixian_: your IP address looks OK in either case -- what's the subnet mask, 255.255.255.0 ?
[neutral]	[03:36]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: on the menu not the window I mean
[negative]	[03:36]	<funkyb>	(flip to pg 1, sorry)
[neutral]	[03:36]	<ToddEDM>	i would like to change the settings on Compiz.... how would i do that ???
[negative]	[03:36]	<element>	in fact none of my USB works unless I plug in in before i turn the computer on
[neutral]	[03:36]	<ixian_>	gonk23: yes
[negative]	[03:36]	<flick>	how do i create new items in the Applications menu?
[neutral]	[03:36]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: tab?
[negative]	[03:36]	<mark_>	keycool: don't ask to ask, just ask.
[negative]	[03:36]	<element>	and now the ipod won't even mount if I put it in before i turn the computer on
[positive]	[03:36]	<funkyb>	ToddEDM, you need to install the compiz settings manager
[positive]	[03:36]	<funkyb>	it adds those features to your preferences menu
[positive]	[03:36]	<ToddEDM>	thank you funky
[neutral]	[03:36]	<funkyb>	np

[negative]	[03:37]	<TokenBad>	friend has a 3com etherfast nic card and installed ubuntu edgy...and it didn't detect his nic card so he has no inet...is there a way to fix it?
[negative]	[03:37]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: its kinda hard for me to explain, I use xubuntu. Oh and there is something about the splash thing in menu.lst use locate command to find it, updatedb if it finds nothing
[neutral]	[03:37]	<funkyb>	ndiswrapper maybe?
[neutral]	[03:37]	<element>	my ipod isn't auto mounting
[negative]	[03:37]	<element>	how do i fix it?
[neutral]	[03:37]	<oxeimon>	element: your mom isn't auto-mounting
[negative]	[03:38]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: what do I look for?
[neutral]	[03:38]	<IntuitiveNipple>	ToddEDM: It should be there as System > Preferences > Advanced Desktop Effects Settings
[positive]	[03:38]	<funkyb>	I had to identify my card using lspci or lsusb (forget which), then get the XP drivers from Dell, then use ndiswrapper to get the card working
[negative]	[03:38]	<mark_>	element: Are you using rhythmbox?
[neutral]	[03:38]	<funkyb>	Intuit, that packages is not shipped with gusty is it:?
[positive]	[03:38]	<oxeimon>	element: jkjk :-D :-D :-D
[neutral]	[03:38]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: ctrl +f splash
[negative]	[03:38]	<funkyb>	I had to install ut manuallyt
[negative]	[03:38]	<element>	i just want to use it as a hard drive
[negative]	[03:38]	<Akaishi>	this doesn't seem like quite what I'm looking for
[negative]	[03:38]	<zetheroo>	"trogdor: isn't it called something different than ""splash"" in linux?"
[neutral]	[03:38]	<oxeimon>	does anyone here have an amd64 system with an ATI-graphics card
[negative]	[03:39]	<trogdor>	zetheroo: not really... do you want it to be?
[positive]	[03:39]	<VousDeux>	I think that Xubuntu VM will make a pretty good hack environment...I think I'll keep it :)
[negative]	[03:39]	<keycool>	I have a Cisco Aironet Wireless 802.11b card for my t40 thinkpad, I cant get WPA networking to come up on my join network menu
[neutral]	[03:39]	<zetheroo>	trogdor: ha
[neutral]	[03:39]	<funkyb>	I started w/ amd64, ran into problems and flipped to 32 bit and everything worked much easier.
[negative]	[03:39]	<gonk23>	"ixiam_: I assume the ""default route"" on the connection information screen said 192.168.1.1 ?"
[negative]	[03:39]	<mark_>	element: Have you tried this? @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:39]	<keycool>	any thoughts?
[negative]	[03:39]	<Akaishi>	my issue is that my CD drive has a questionable IDE cable that causes data errors when I try to install from it. It's good enough to run the liveCD but I need to install to hard drive via network and I don't have another machine
[positive]	[03:39]	<addicted68098>	The ipod is reconized as an external harddrive and not just an ipod right?
[negative]	[03:39]	<joanki>	on ubuntu domcumentation, it says:  Ubuntu can read and write files on your Windows partition.
[negative]	[03:39]	<joanki>	Is this a good idea?
[neutral]	[03:39]	<element>	i have rockbox on my ipod
[negative]	[03:39]	<thedukeny_>	is it possible to get my resultion back to 1650 x 1050 even tho i can't select it?
[negative]	[03:39]	<zado>	has anyone else try installing an application with ADD/Remove only have it tell you that you have a conflicting package installed please romve it OR this application was not designed for i386?
[negative]	[03:39]	<zyxnull>	keycool: i guess that card needs a firmware upgrade to get WPA
[negative]	[03:39]	<trogdor>	funkyb: yeah no reason to use 64 bit unless you have huge loads off ram like 2gb+
[neutral]	[03:40]	<thedefender>	joanki | NTFS
[negative]	[03:40]	<funkyb>	NTFS support is supposed to be safe now...i still worry a bit
[neutral]	[03:40]	<thedefender>	!NTFS | NTFS
[negative]	[03:40]	<joanki>	so i should do it
[neutral]	[03:40]	<ubotu>	NTFS: ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see @HLINK .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[neutral]	[03:40]	<joanki>	because that way i don't have to switch back and forth if i want say, a document
[neutral]	[03:40]	<up365>	ToddEDM, take alook here @HLINK
[negative]	[03:40]	<keycool>	zyxnull, how do I do that?
[neutral]	[03:40]	<thedefender>	lol
[negative]	[03:40]	<mark_>	keycool: This page doesn't mention WPA support for your card: @HLINK
[positive]	[03:40]	<zyxnull>	joanki: YES! it works great, been using it for a while (with 7.04 + automatix) and works great!
[negative]	[03:40]	<funkyb>	anyone know of a cool app launcher bar?  I haven't found one i like yet... at least not a supported one...
[neutral]	[03:41]	<joanki>	is 7.1 safe
[negative]	[03:41]	<axisys>	how do I get the 3d effect shows here on the right second image  @HLINK ?
[negative]	[03:41]	<joanki>	i'm woried to do this
[negative]	[03:41]	<keycool>	mark_, does that mean there isn't?
[positive]	[03:41]	<mark_>	keycool: It may still be possible some other way.... avoiding NetworkManager and using ndiswrapper, but depending on your situation, getting a more compatible card may be simpler.
[neutral]	[03:41]	<thedefender>	funkyb: try AWN
[positive]	[03:41]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Akaishi: There is a neat way of solving that alot of the time - take the cable off, put each of the connectors in a vice, and squeeze it carefully but hard. It usually improves the electrical connections and solves the issues when the cable has been strained for whatever reason
[neutral]	[03:41]	<geoff_>	how do i enable desktop effects on a fresh xubuntu gutsy install?
[neutral]	[03:41]	<diizy_>	Hi All, where can i get assistance for audio programs?
[negative]	[03:41]	<zyxnull>	keycool: Ok, let me check i used to have that old device somewhere near

[negative]	[03:41]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about effects - try searching on @HLINK
[negative]	[03:41]	<funkyb>	i'm on a lappy so getting a more compatable card was less desirable

[positive]	[03:41]	<Akaishi>	nah, the cable is 40 conductor, it needs to be 80. I've got a replacement cable being shipped but I'm impatient :D
[positive]	[03:41]	<funkyb>	ndiswrapper was easy to do
[negative]	[03:41]	<ali110>	i just installed kubuntu 7.10 and after installation it offered me to install my ATI property drive ( which i really wanted to install) after installation i restarted my computer for it to take effect but once ubuntu starts my monitor shows that it is out of sing, as a result i couldnt log onto kubuntu at all currently i am using my windows , what should i do
[neutral]	[03:42]	<thedefender>	geoff: go to system\ preferences\ apperence
[neutral]	[03:42]	<Ryuho>	sup scroll
[neutral]	[03:42]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Akaishi: well the 40-core cable should just limit the max ATA rate, it ought not cause data loss
[neutral]	[03:42]	<phed>	Hi
[negative]	[03:42]	<thedefender>	geoff: go to effects and enable them to as you wish, if you want more compex effects
[neutral]	[03:42]	<geoff_>	thedefender, im using Xubuntu not gnome.
[neutral]	[03:42]	<speaker219_>	Quick question. In ubuntu 7.10, is ndiswrapper installed?
[negative]	[03:42]	<phed>	Why can't I open this file in Ubuntu?  @HLINK
[neutral]	[03:42]	<thedefender>	i see
[neutral]	[03:42]	<axisys>	ali110: copy your previous xorg.conf.<ext> to xorg.conf and restart
[neutral]	[03:42]	<funkyb>	speaker, no
[neutral]	[03:43]	<mark_>	speaker219_:  You can check yourself in synaptic.
[neutral]	[03:43]	<Akaishi>	well if it's not the cable it's the motherboard and I'm trying very hard to believe it's not the motherboard
[negative]	[03:43]	<funkyb>	at least it wasn't when I used the beta
[negative]	[03:43]	<zetheroo>	ok... I am installing the splash-manager from synaptic... we'll see how that goes....
[negative]	[03:43]	<ali110>	axisys: how to do that ( iam a noob in linux )
[negative]	[03:43]	<funkyb>	who made the board akaishi?
[negative]	[03:43]	<thedefender>	hmmm, not sure if Xubuntu has effects, seeing is it is suppose to be a lighter system
[neutral]	[03:43]	<siriusnova>	man
[neutral]	[03:44]	<Akaishi>	it's an abit VA-10
[negative]	[03:44]	<siriusnova>	it kind of sucks that there is no filesystem compatability between macs and linux
[neutral]	[03:44]	<siriusnova>	:|
[negative]	[03:44]	<ali110>	axisys: i can run kubuntu in command line mode , then from where should i copy the files and to where
[neutral]	[03:44]	<trogdor>	thedefender: effects can be installed to any system
[positive]	[03:44]	<funkyb>	abit makes damn good boards, i'm hoping it's not the board with you :-)

[neutral]	[03:44]	<axisys>	look at the date
[negative]	[03:44]	<siriusnova>	no macs are hfs+
[neutral]	[03:44]	<cafuego>	or ufs
[neutral]	[03:45]	<thedefender>	trogdor: yes but is it already preinstalled on Xubuntu
[neutral]	[03:45]	<darkcrab>	my mac is formated in ext3
[negative]	[03:45]	<diizy_>	anyone know how I can get ardour to install as it will not allow me through add/remove for some reason?
[neutral]	[03:45]	<cafuego>	or hfs, or hfs+journaling
[negative]	[03:45]	<siriusnova>	UFS is bad under linux isnt it?
[neutral]	[03:45]	<funkyb>	wutz mac?  (lol)
[neutral]	[03:45]	<keycool>	zyxnull, any luck?
[neutral]	[03:45]	<axisys>	the one before the xorg.conf was the last good one
[neutral]	[03:45]	<cafuego>	darkcrab: Not under OSX it isn't.
[positive]	[03:45]	<darkcrab>	that is what it said when I formated it
[neutral]	[03:45]	<trogdor>	thedefender: where you buying xubuntu preinstalled from?...
[neutral]	[03:45]	<phed>	hi?
[negative]	[03:45]	<ali110>	axisys: thanks i will try but this will make the ATI driver stop working i think , if it is so what is the correct way to install my ATI driver
[negative]	[03:45]	<siriusnova>	Basically I have an external HD which I need to use with Linux and a Mac box
[neutral]	[03:45]	<axisys>	ali110: so just copy that last good one to xorg.conf

[negative]	[03:46]	<VousDeux>	If I have a virtual machine that is fullscreen on desktop 2, how can I switch back to desktop 1?
[positive]	[03:46]	<axisys>	ali110: well that will give your window manager back atleast
[negative]	[03:46]	<cafuego>	hfs+ cna be mounted read-write in Linux, but you'll need to recompile the HFS module for it.
[positive]	[03:46]	<trogdor>	thedefender: if you want effects just apt-get install compiz-fusion. it works on every setup however kde is bloated on its own built in effects system so running both might be lacking on performance
[neutral]	[03:46]	<Madpilot>	VousDeux, Ctrl+Alt+Left Arrow|Right Arrow
[neutral]	[03:46]	<zar>	ctrl + alt + left key will move to desktop 1
[positive]	[03:46]	<ali110>	axisys: yes thanks very much

[neutral]	[03:47]	<Cryoniq>	phew.. now I can start compiz at least with the radeon open source drivers. But things are.. veeeeery slow moving windows or rotating cube..

[positive]	[04:10]	<trogdor>	tux: there are lots of volume levels and sound switching options. Its a science of its own using the sound mixing options, there also a lot of alternative sound daemons to use and special kernels options/modification for better sound quality

[negative]	[04:14]	<IntuitiveNipple>	zeeeee: that's it... using qemu-launcher (an apt-get install) you'll get a nice GUI dialog front-end. With that you can quickly mount the ISO installer CD image as a CD, and boot the QEMU guest from it, install, and off you go

[neutral]	[04:15]	<trogdor>	Casey: well winamp can be run under wine, and there are much more efficient open source alternatives to streaming video and music.

[negative]	[04:16]	<mpeters>	you can run compiz and tell it to skip the checks

[negative]	[04:18]	<zeeeee>	ok, sounds like virtualbox is more advanced, and that qemu in the repos is actually the emulator, and not the latest virtualizer (qemu accelerator)
[negative]	[04:18]	<trogdor>	Casey: you might be missing some codecs and therefor having problems, ubuntu uses gstreamer codec packages

[positive]	[04:25]	<astro76>	biggahed, well you shouldn't take offense as it's a very common new user question... but if it's used as cache it's not being used for nothing, and you have to consider used-cached as the true amount of used ram

[negative]	[04:26]	<trogdor>	navets: search for it in synaptic right click and choose completely remove. You might still see it trying to close off virtual box on shutdown because it wasn't removed but worry not because it was, if it showed up on ps then it wasn't.

[neutral]	[04:38]	<ALice_en_REiCIel>	halo...
[negative]	[04:38]	<trogdor>	darkcrab: oh I thought there was a specific hardware reason to run linux on it
[neutral]	[04:39]	<Jordan_U>	"oxeimon, It will start with ""xorg.conf"" and probably end in a date"
[neutral]	[04:39]	<darkcrab>	not really, no
[negative]	[04:39]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: To save confusion it helps not to use the Windows disk lettering language, since that doesn't apply to Linux at all. I'm guessing that right now you've got a physical disk drive (probably called /dev/sda) and it has one partition on it (/dev/sda1) containing Windows, and another partition (/dev/sda2 ?) that you're calling 'drive d'
[neutral]	[04:39]	<darkcrab>	more developer
[negative]	[04:39]	<the_darkside_986>	hi everyone. i'm having trouble getting openGL apps to run in 640x480 resolution. higher resolutions work though. i turned off graphical desktop effects so i do not know what to do...
[negative]	[04:39]	<alcaponage>	When I update my repository, the packages 'Translation en_CA' failed

[neutral]	[04:39]	<joanki>	yes
[negative]	[04:40]	<oxeimon>	Jordan_U: When I start up ubuntu, everything looks compeltely messed up...I can't even see anything clearly

[negative]	[04:40]	<c_plus_plus>	inigmatoya: i have no way of knowing what the output was since x imediately restarted.
[negative]	[04:40]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: If I'm correct then I'm guessing that the installer thinks it should resize /dev/sda2 by about 50% to save whatever is in there, and install Ubuntu in the remainder
[neutral]	[04:40]	<d4rkmonkey>	!ask | PokoTao

[positive]	[04:40]	<pwnt->	Cool, I got my mouse buttons to work! all of them :)
[negative]	[04:40]	<Jordan_U>	oxeimon, Try starting in recovery mode or try pressing ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a terminal
[negative]	[04:40]	<pwnt->	I'm org btw.
[neutral]	[04:40]	<the_darkside_986>	when i try to run a 3d app in 640x480 (the default for games like briquolo) i get only a black screen. i already ran nvidia-xconfig and x still works but it didn't fix the problem.
[negative]	[04:40]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Oni-Dracula: I'm not entirely sure, it's a long time since I messed with that. You'd have to check the documents.
[positive]	[04:40]	<Madpilot>	wastrel, well, a music player, but one that can play whole albums - can't stand the iPod Shuffle style of one-track-at-random.
[positive]	[04:40]	<cin>	Madpilot, music? Amarok plays music collections... as does XMMS. XMMS is probably simplest; Amarok is like iTunes
[positive]	[04:41]	<trogdor>	oxeimon: switch /etc/X11/xorg.conf driver to vesa if you need to work in graphical setting, you can use nano to edit from recovery mode
[negative]	[04:41]	<Sir_Sid>	Is there a way to stop programs from using the system beep. Whenever i backspace to the end, pidgin and xfire do a system beep and thats very annoying.

[negative]	[04:41]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: did you check your xorg log to see if it says anything about what happened?
[negative]	[04:41]	<darkcrab>	the_darkside_986 do you have desktop effects enabled?
[neutral]	[04:41]	<wastrel>	Madpilot: xmms?  can't grip play as well as rip, that's nice & simple...
[neutral]	[04:41]	<thedonvaughn>	Madpilot: banshee.  Or just setup MPD
[negative]	[04:41]	<Oni-Dracula>	IntuitiveNipple, I'm still having problems with samba - it's not accepting the username/password I'm giving it in winderz
[negative]	[04:41]	<wastrel>	dunno i never listen to music
[neutral]	[04:41]	<trogdor>	oxeimon: I suggest you get direct rendering working for your card though to get better performance
[negative]	[04:41]	<the_darkside_986>	darkcrab: i have disabled fancy desktop effects.
[neutral]	[04:41]	<Jordan_U>	Sir_Sid, rmmod pcspkr

[negative]	[04:41]	<pwnt->	funkyb: yeah I guess so
[negative]	[04:41]	<oxeimon>	Jordan_U: So I have xorg.conf, xorg.conf~, xorg.conf.1, xorg.conf.2...etc
[negative]	[04:41]	<avis>	will my xorg.conf be different if i use the alternate cd instead of the desktop install cd ?   i'm thinking about using the alternatve 7.10 install cd since it will be finished first before testing if 1680x1050 will work in the desktop cd.  i was told the nvidia driver would support the 8500GT
[negative]	[04:41]	<oxeimon>	trogdor: what's direct rendering?
[negative]	[04:41]	<funkyb>	hehe, just joking around of course
[negative]	[04:41]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: where is the xlog stored?
[negative]	[04:41]	<Sir_Sid>	Jordan_U, whats that do exactly?
[negative]	[04:41]	<KeithWeisshar>	how do i make vista the default grub option
[negative]	[04:41]	<oxeimon>	trogdor: Everything was working fine until I  messed with displayconfig-gtk
[neutral]	[04:41]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Oni-Dracula: check the local logs in /var/log/samba/ for clues
[neutral]	[04:41]	<trogdor>	oxeimon: 3d stuffs with fancy shading and etc
[neutral]	[04:42]	<darkcrab>	does your monitor support the resolution your running it in?
[neutral]	[04:42]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[positive]	[04:42]	<Jordan_U>	Sir_Sid, It removes the driver that lets you send sound to your system beep hardware :)
[negative]	[04:42]	<oxeimon>	trogdor: Yeah all that was working fine. I was just trying to get my dual-monitor setup working
[negative]	[04:42]	<Jordan_U>	Sir_Sid, You need to use sudo BTW
[negative]	[04:42]	<oxeimon>	Jordan_U: Which xorg do I want?
[negative]	[04:42]	<trogdor>	oxeimon: did that app back up your xorg.conf file? perhaps its just a mater of renaming a few files
[neutral]	[04:42]	<Sir_Sid>	Jordan_U, Thanks. That beep has been driving me insane
[positive]	[04:42]	<Prax>	whats different in the xorg.conf between a screen and a monitor?
[positive]	[04:42]	<PokoTao>	ok, good point :). I'm trying to install Glade on 7.10, but Synaptic says glade-gnome requires glade-common >= 2.8. Unfortunately, Synaptic only has glade-common at 2.12.
[negative]	[04:42]	<Jordan_U>	oxeimon, I don't know
[negative]	[04:42]	<thedonvaughn>	"KeithWeisshar: in /boot/grub/menu.lst there is a ""default directive"" ""default <num>"" where num is the number entry for Windows in grub.  Start with counting from 0, so the first entry is 0."
[negative]	[04:42]	<trogdor>	oxeimon: if all else fails insert live cd and copy what settings it has
[negative]	[04:43]	<Jordan_U>	trogdor, That is what I suggested, he has many alternate backups in /etc/X11 for some reason
[positive]	[04:43]	<oxeimon>	trogdor: I have a lot of different xorg.conf's, the current(bad) one: xorg.conf, and then also xorg.conf~, xorg.conf.1, xorg.conf.2...etc
[positive]	[04:43]	<darkcrab>	if not the_darkside_986 go into the config file for the game, set the resolution to your current resolution, and see if that helps
[positive]	[04:43]	<Oni-Dracula>	IntuitiveNipple, funny that... all the logs are empty :)
[positive]	[04:43]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Oni-Dracula: Is the smbd server actually running? :p
[neutral]	[04:43]	<trogdor>	oxeimon: good luck then
[negative]	[04:43]	<the_darkside_986>	darkcrab: ok i guess i can try that but this never happened in gutsy. i was wanting to run sauerbraten in 640x480 for performance reasons but 800x600 is fine.
[negative]	[04:44]	<the_darkside_986>	*i mean feisty and dapper
[positive]	[04:44]	<Jordan_U>	oxeimon, Try any of them, since you havn't had any problems before they are likely all good, or just delete your current one and let X figure itself out on its own :)
[negative]	[04:44]	<Madpilot>	gah... does anyone actually USE Rhythmbox? Goofy thing is far too complex for it's own good. Off to find something else - thanks for the suggestions, folks.
[negative]	[04:44]	<IntuitiveNipple>	"Oni-Dracula: "" ps -ef | grep smbd"" should show a couple of processes at least"

[negative]	[05:08]	<Jordan_U>	I am getting this error upgrading to Gutsy, @HLINK it doesn't go away no matter how many times I say yes, should I say no?
[negative]	[05:08]	<ShadowMinds>	oxeimon: so you have dvi out what is the problem your having with your dual monitor setup?

[negative]	[05:08]	<orlando>	ok
[negative]	[05:08]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: I don't know how to set it up. I just installed 7.10, and right now my two monitors are in mirror-mode.
[negative]	[05:08]	<joanki>	i'm trying to install ubuntu and it's becoming a disaster
[neutral]	[05:08]	<c_plus_plu1>	inigomontoya: @HLINK
[neutral]	[05:08]	<dimas_>	!ask
[positive]	[05:08]	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[positive]	[05:08]	<asbani>	mechdave: last few lines again from new shell/cpan @HLINK
[negative]	[05:08]	<IntuitiveNipple>	kingnothing: I've just checked... I've been running it with 'Custom' for a while with no problems like that
[negative]	[05:09]	<Vlet>	oxeimon: yeah, but they use their own chipset as far as I know
[neutral]	[05:09]	<orlando>	Jordan_U: here is: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:09]	<joanki>	IntuitiveNipple: i did what you said, do you mind helping me now?
[neutral]	[05:09]	<joanki>	d drive is free space now
[negative]	[05:09]	<astro76>	joanki, is there an option to have Ubuntu use the free space?
[neutral]	[05:09]	<joanki>	it's not partitioned anymore
[negative]	[05:09]	<ShadowMinds>	oxeimon: ah ok, go to System > Administration > Screens and Graphics
[negative]	[05:09]	<kingnothing>	IntuitiveNipple: hm. thanks for checking. it's frustrating :/
[negative]	[05:09]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Ok, with it deleted you can restart the installer.
[neutral]	[05:09]	<orlando>	Jordan_U: what can I do??
[negative]	[05:09]	<joanki>	ok
[negative]	[05:09]	<rickjones>	"hi all, i'm trying to install edgy on a new system ( new to me ) and everything goes fine till i try to use the command "" lspci"" nothing happens. also, the realtec nic is not being detected, in fact NOTHING is being detected. is there a way to `force` edgy to detect hardwaRE?"
[negative]	[05:09]	<joanki>	now when it says how do you want to parittion the disk, what do i say?
[negative]	[05:10]	<Shoopuf>	"When I went to ""Add/Remove..."" in the applications menu it said that the program list was out-of-date, so then I clicked ""Update"" and it said another Synaptic was open so it didn't update. The other Synaptic finished and now I am opening Add/Remove again but it isn't giving me the update dialogue, how do I get my Add/Remove list to update?"
[negative]	[05:10]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: thats where i had to go to set mine up.
[positive]	[05:10]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: As for the swap-space, to be honest I can't remember what the installer does in guided mode but it should create a swap partition :)
[neutral]	[05:10]	<orlando>	Jordan_U: I tryied with Debian..
[neutral]	[05:10]	<joanki>	nothok
[negative]	[05:10]	<asbani>	rickjones: edgy? Why not gutsy? Interesting
[negative]	[05:10]	<kingnothing>	rickjones: why are you installing edgy?
[negative]	[05:10]	<oxeimon>	"ShadowMinds: I see two screens, each called ""Screen1"", and I can't make one a secondary screen either"
[neutral]	[05:10]	<Talcite>	rickjones: I'd double check the install
[negative]	[05:10]	<rickjones>	asbani, the last 3 gutsy cd's i've burned do NOT boot the computer at all, so , i'll go edgy and upgrade.
[neutral]	[05:10]	<Vlet>	Shoopuf: hit ctrl-f2 and then type: sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[05:10]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: If you select Guided again, it should offer to use the entire unused space on that hard drive as you originally expected
[positive]	[05:10]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: One of the screens is always disabled...
[negative]	[05:10]	<Ashfire908>	rickjones, did you try thr alternate cd?
[positive]	[05:10]	<Talcite>	rickjones: lspci is a very low level command, it interacts with the kernel
[negative]	[05:11]	<rickjones>	is it downloadable ?
[negative]	[05:11]	<joanki>	ok
[negative]	[05:11]	<Talcite>	rickjones: yeah, it is downloadable
[negative]	[05:11]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: in your Xorg.conf, comment out these lines NvAGP, DisableGLXRootClipping
[negative]	[05:11]	<Vegancheesesteak>	hi all.  i cant seem to get flash to install in gutsy...anyone else having probs?
[positive]	[05:11]	<slvmchn>	is there a site where i can see the benefits of ubuntu/debian on a dual-core processor?
[positive]	[05:11]	<Ashfire908>	rickjones, no we keep it under gurad :P
[negative]	[05:11]	<Aishiko>	rickjones, you might wnat to tell people who your talking to otherwise they may miss it.
[neutral]	[05:11]	<rickjones>	nice
[negative]	[05:11]	<c_plus_plu1>	inigomontoya: ok...
[negative]	[05:11]	<rickjones>	all i want it to support my nic and video card like it does the HP machine sitting next to it
[negative]	[05:12]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: another thing, all the options should be in the device section not the screen section
[positive]	[05:12]	<Shoopuf>	Vlet: Thanks.
[negative]	[05:12]	<rickjones>	Talcite : where is this alt. cd ?
[positive]	[05:12]	<Vlet>	Shoopuf: :)
[neutral]	[05:12]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: if you set one screen to defualt it should automatically set the other to secondary. Check where it says Graphics Card, and make sure it has your Graphics card selected. Also on which ever screen is disabled click on model in the Screen tab. Then find the model and manurfacture of the monitor
[negative]	[05:12]	<Shoopuf>	What is the GNOME equivelant of Amarok called? I don't see it in Add/Remove.
[neutral]	[05:12]	<Ashfire908>	rickjones, it's the checkbox on the download page
[positive]	[05:12]	<Ryuho>	how would i make a simple keyboard shortcut that brings up bash in terminal?
[neutral]	[05:12]	<rickjones>	k
[neutral]	[05:12]	<inigomontoya>	shoopuf: exaile
[neutral]	[05:12]	<c_plus_plu1>	inigomontoya: which options?
[negative]	[05:12]	<asbani>	rickjones: don't do that mate. you have edgy, then fiesty, then gutsy. edgy is real old I think. not really good idea to upgrade from edgy > fiesty > gutsy! I've read somewhere that upgrading has bugs. I couldn't upgrade from gutsy beta to gutsy final. or even from fiesty to gutsy myself. see here too another people has same problem too. @HLINK
[negative]	[05:12]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: also make sure the monitor that says disabled it check to secondary and not disabled
[negative]	[05:12]	<Helmi>	hey guys - i just activated visual effects in gutsy and i'm looking for the control panel to setup the effects in detail and can't find it :(
[neutral]	[05:13]	<regulate>	inigomontoya: there's also banshee
[neutral]	[05:13]	<regulate>	ooops
[neutral]	[05:13]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: move every line in the screen section that starts with Option to the device section
[negative]	[05:13]	<c_plus_plu1>	inigomontoya: ok
[neutral]	[05:13]	<regulate>	Shoopuf: banshee (requires mono)
[negative]	[05:13]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: if the manufacturer isn't listed, can I just use Generic?
[positive]	[05:13]	<rickjones>	Talcite : this will detect and support my realtek nic ?
[negative]	[05:13]	<Vegancheesesteak>	also what java should i install for eclipse?
[negative]	[05:13]	<inigomontoya>	regulate: i had mono once
[neutral]	[05:13]	<kingnothing>	Helmi: you have to install compizconfig-settings-manager
[positive]	[05:13]	<regulate>	inigomontoya: did a boy give it to you?
[negative]	[05:13]	<Talcite>	rickjones: it's hard to say. Realtek NICs shouldn't have a problem.
[negative]	[05:13]	<dimas_>	i had ov51x drver working good with camera in festy but now on gutsy the software does not reach the device
[negative]	[05:13]	<asbani>	"I'm trying to install DBI from cpan, and I keep getting errors. please help me with this. check my error here ""@HLINK"
[positive]	[05:14]	<Helmi>	kingnothing, thanks will try
[negative]	[05:14]	<Talcite>	rickjones: they both use the same kernel though, so I would say probably not, but you don't have many other choices =P
[neutral]	[05:14]	<c_plus_plu1>	inigomontoya: testing...
[neutral]	[05:14]	<oxeimon>	"ShadowMinds: The ""secondary screen"" option is grayed out..."
[negative]	[05:14]	<inigomontoya>	regulate: no, but i know a girl didnt either ::grumble::
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Vlet>	Helmi: install compizconfig-settings-manager
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Ashfire908>	asbani, check the ubuntu forums
[positive]	[05:14]	<mechdave>	asbani, do you have build essential installed?
[positive]	[05:14]	<Helmi>	Vlet, thanks
[positive]	[05:14]	<astro76>	Vegancheesesteak, eclipse works fine with java6
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Talcite>	rickjones: the fact that lspci doesn't output anything though indicates something is wrong
[neutral]	[05:14]	<kingnothing>	Helmi: sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[neutral]	[05:14]	<Vegancheesesteak>	astro76: from multiverse?
[negative]	[05:14]	<Wolf23>	guys how can i download or build from the sources libmp3lame?
[neutral]	[05:14]	<asbani>	mechdave: not sure about that. whats build essential?
[negative]	[05:14]	<Helmi>	kingnothing, yeah i know thanks
[positive]	[05:14]	<kingnothing>	okay :)
[neutral]	[05:14]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon i sent you a IM
[neutral]	[05:14]	<astro76>	Vegancheesesteak, yes
[negative]	[05:14]	<rickjones>	Talcite : could it be the hardware isn't being detected due to some bios setting
[positive]	[05:15]	<Vegancheesesteak>	astro76: thanks
[negative]	[05:15]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: I don't see your IM
[negative]	[05:15]	<Talcite>	rickjones: yeah, but it should detect your chipset and everything else either way
[negative]	[05:15]	<asbani>	Ashfire908: you got a link of a guy having same problem as mine?
[positive]	[05:15]	<rickjones>	Talcite : will lspci work in 'live' user mode ?
[positive]	[05:15]	<Talcite>	rickjones: but you're right, bios could play a role
[negative]	[05:15]	<Talcite>	rickjones: 'live'? you mean livecd?
[positive]	[05:15]	<mechdave>	asbani, build essential is the gcc compiler package for ubuntu. do apt-get install build-essential
[positive]	[05:15]	<joanki>	IntuitiveNipple:  now there is only the guided - use entire disk option
[negative]	[05:15]	<joanki>	is that what i want?
[negative]	[05:15]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: hmm it should of poped up try sending me one
[positive]	[05:15]	<joanki>	won't that overwrite my xp?
[positive]	[05:15]	<Ashfire908>	asbani, no i mean use the search box :)
[negative]	[05:15]	<rickjones>	Talcite : yes. livecd , sorry
[negative]	[05:15]	<allobjects>	"wirechief1, I have done your steps and only thing remaining after the dist-upgrade is that ""digikam-doc"" has been kept back"
[neutral]	[05:15]	<asbani>	mechdave: righty
[negative]	[05:16]	<asbani>	Ashfire908: Okay

[neutral]	[05:16]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: bullet-proof x started
[negative]	[05:16]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: I just tried sending you one, didn't seem to work...
[neutral]	[05:16]	<Talcite>	rickjones: it should. once the kernel is loaded, there shouldn't be any problems with hardware-kernel interations
[neutral]	[05:16]	<Wolf23>	anyone help please?
[negative]	[05:16]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: what's your aim sn?
[neutral]	[05:16]	<dimas_>	!ask
[positive]	[05:16]	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[neutral]	[05:16]	<Ashfire908>	asbani, you have build-essentail i think, cause the command make was found

[negative]	[05:16]	<rickjones>	Talcite : lspci outputs nothing
[positive]	[05:16]	<Talcite>	rickjones: try resetting your bios to default settings, and also look online to see if other people have problems using the same mobo
[neutral]	[05:16]	<Ryan52>	"I'm trying to set up keyboard shortcuts and they all work exect when I try ""<super>c"". If I change it to ""<super>1"" it works fine. What do I need to do to make this work. Also when I do the key combination ""<super>c"" my cursor moves to the middle of the screen."
[neutral]	[05:16]	<asbani>	Ashfire908: no I don't have build-essentail, i just did apt-get install build-essentail and its downloading as we speak
[negative]	[05:17]	<Talcite>	rickjones: there's not much we can do... check the md5sum of your liveCDs as well
[negative]	[05:17]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: can you just tell me in this chatroom?
[neutral]	[05:17]	<rickjones>	Talcite: fair enough. i'm downloading the alt cd now to burn
[positive]	[05:17]	<asbani>	mechdave: whats also important things to install such as build-essentail for a new system? :)

[negative]	[05:17]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: yea seems like alot of txt though lol, but yea it should have your maker of monitor
[negative]	[05:17]	<kingnothing>	does anyone know why PHP is no longer working on my install? I'm not sure what might have changed from 7.04 to 7.10 to do that...
[negative]	[05:17]	<Ashfire908>	asbani, hmm, i assumed if you could use make you had that package
[neutral]	[05:17]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: yes
[neutral]	[05:17]	<mechdave>	asbani, Perl may have C/C++ modules in the code
[negative]	[05:17]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: are you using LCD monitors?

[negative]	[05:20]	<Dante124>	Man oh Man...Just installed Gutsy....and it takes 3 minutes to boot....no ubuntu login screen until then either...what's up with that?
[negative]	[05:20]	<nrdb>	mechdave, asbani, that would be 'sudo apt-get install build-essential' ?
[positive]	[05:20]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: sweet thanks :-D :-D :-D
[neutral]	[05:20]	<martyvis>	joanki: just ask your q!
[negative]	[05:20]	<astro76>	joanki, double ram doesn't necessarily apply to systems over 512 MB ram, that's an old guideline
[negative]	[05:20]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: it should look like this, @HLINK
[negative]	[05:20]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, you don't know how much ram you have?
[negative]	[05:21]	<joanki>	1 gb
[positive]	[05:21]	<mechdave>	nrdb, Uum yeah, thx :)
[negative]	[05:21]	<sharp>	is there anything i can do (besides compiling picard) to get picard to work with mp3's??
[neutral]	[05:21]	<joanki>	so when i am creating swap,
[negative]	[05:21]	<asbani>	nrdb: hmm
[negative]	[05:21]	<joanki>	then what size do i make it?
[negative]	[05:21]	<asbani>	I think it asks me for gutsy CD because I have to upgrade my sources.list or something?
[positive]	[05:21]	<scriptdevil>	joanki: another 1 gig??
[neutral]	[05:21]	<Vlet>	Ashfire908: regardless of whether you have the php-cli, you can still run it from the cl
[neutral]	[05:21]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: the monitor is made by Hannspree, Inc.
[negative]	[05:21]	<slackern>	asbani: System-Administration-Software Sources and then tick out the cdrom at the bottom there and it won't look for the cd/dvd any longer and only use online repos.
[negative]	[05:22]	<mechdave>	Oops too many hyphens there!
[negative]	[05:22]	<joanki>	but how can i set it to something i don't have?!
[negative]	[05:22]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: how much memory does your PC have? usually you want about 150% of RAM to allow for hibernation, if you intend the PC to hibernate
[positive]	[05:22]	<ShadowMinds>	"Oxeimon: its a 19"" LCD Flat Panel monitor :)"
[negative]	[05:22]	<Dante124>	Man oh Man...Just installed Gutsy....and it takes 3 minutes to boot....no ubuntu login screen until then either...what's up with that?
[neutral]	[05:22]	<martyvis>	joanki: you can probably get away with no swap with 1GB ram
[negative]	[05:22]	<asbani>	slackern: cool thanks! should I change something in my online repos?
[negative]	[05:22]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: yup I know. It's not under the manufacturers though
[neutral]	[05:22]	<martyvis>	joanki: however is your want to hibernate you will want 1GB plus a little bit
[negative]	[05:22]	<Ashfire908>	jonaki, set the swap to about 1 to 2 gb
[neutral]	[05:22]	<joanki>	ok so it says create a new partition
[negative]	[05:22]	<mechdave>	asbani, how did you go?
[neutral]	[05:22]	<joanki>	logical i chose
[positive]	[05:22]	<joanki>	and it says new partition size in megabytes
[neutral]	[05:22]	<Ryan52>	"I'm trying to set up keyboard shortcuts and they all work exect when I try ""<super>c"". If I change it to ""<super>1"" it works fine. What do I need to do to make this work. Also when I do the key combination ""<super>c"" my cursor moves to the middle of the screen."
[negative]	[05:22]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: So, if the PC has 1GB of RAM, then a swap of 1.5GB is sufficient (for hibernation purposes)
[negative]	[05:22]	<joanki>	what do i enter?
[positive]	[05:22]	<slackern>	asbani: nah i don't think you need to, mine is working perfect as it is, it just seems to sort itself automaticlly for me :)
[neutral]	[05:23]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: restarting x...
[negative]	[05:23]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: hmm try using generic then, you still be able to use it then
[negative]	[05:23]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, yep, logical
[neutral]	[05:23]	<joanki>	um .... how many megabytes is 1.5 GB?
[neutral]	[05:23]	<scriptdevil>	can anyone temme if i need to change my repos in order to upgrade my distro??? i dont get the option of upgrading in update manager
[neutral]	[05:23]	<martyvis>	joanki: 1500
[neutral]	[05:23]	<scriptdevil>	joanki: 1500 rougly
[neutral]	[05:23]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, one 1GB is 1024 MB
[positive]	[05:23]	<astro76>	joanki, 1536 ;)
[negative]	[05:23]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: because when i did mine it showed one of my monitors as a Generic, and i had to go change the model and stuff
[negative]	[05:23]	<joanki>	ok
[negative]	[05:23]	<joanki>	so i should set it to 1536
[positive]	[05:23]	<joanki>	even though this tutorial says to set it to double
[neutral]	[05:23]	<astro76>	probably way overkill
[negative]	[05:23]	<martyvis>	joanki: the tutorial is wrong
[negative]	[05:23]	<ckw_>	anyone here successfully running an ATI dual head video?
[neutral]	[05:23]	<astro76>	joanki, that's old advice, often still repeated
[neutral]	[05:24]	<Shoopuf>	The guided partition erased my NTSF partition. T_T
[neutral]	[05:24]	<joanki>	so 1.5 is fine
[negative]	[05:24]	<joanki>	ok
[negative]	[05:24]	<joanki>	gonna do it for 1536
[positive]	[05:24]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, quit paincing, 1.5 is fine
[negative]	[05:24]	<martyvis>	joanki: this applied when people had ram of 8MB (like my first linux machine in 1993)
[neutral]	[05:24]	<jotil>	1GB is 1000MB, 1GiB is 1024MiB
[neutral]	[05:24]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: testing compiz now...
[negative]	[05:24]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: If the PC had 256MB of RAM then 200% is a good choice. For a PC with 1GB of RAM, then 150% is a better choice
[positive]	[05:24]	<joanki>	THANK YOU
[negative]	[05:24]	<arang2>	guys i read in the forum that in order to make vmware workstation to work again i need to run ./vmware-config.pl to reconfigure, i installed the linux headers and all ok till it tries to build the vmnet module and crashes cos its missing something any ideas?
[negative]	[05:24]	<oxeimon>	"ShadowMinds: okay, I've got it as generic. I still can't click on ""secondary screen"" though"
[negative]	[05:24]	<noor>	"you guys what button is ""Super"" for compiz-fusion ?!!!"
[negative]	[05:25]	<grumbel>	my mouse cursor looks wrong (as in not alpha-blended) on the log-in screen it however is properly alpha-blended, theming isn't the issue, since switching to a different cursor set doesn't fix anything. Anybody knows whats going on (ubuntu7.10, nvidia)?
[negative]	[05:25]	<scriptdevil>	joanki: tutorial is a guideline, it is not binding.. a swap is used to temporarily store data that cant be stored on ram because of no memory.. the processor keeps swapping this... actually i dont remember the swap ever being used on my pc
[negative]	[05:25]	<noor>	"I dunno the ""Super"" Button for compiz-fusion"
[negative]	[05:25]	<jotil>	noor: the windows button
[negative]	[05:25]	<Vlet>	arang2: what's it missing?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<edward>	"I can't run .bin files anymore because ""virus scanner"" opens them, what program is suppost to open .bins ?"
[neutral]	[05:25]	<noor>	jotil:TY
[neutral]	[05:25]	<foug>	how are the repo's doing?
[negative]	[05:25]	<IntuitiveNipple>	arang2: Yes, there's an 'all' patch script, v 114 I think
[positive]	[05:25]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: will it let you put it as default? and the other as secondary?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<Vlet>	noor: the 'windows' key
[negative]	[05:25]	<Ashfire908>	noor: the windows button
[negative]	[05:25]	<c_plus_plus>	"inigomontoya: no more restarting x... but this time it said ""Desktop effects could not be enabled"""
[neutral]	[05:25]	<joanki>	ok also, where should the location of the new partition be - obviously at the END, not beginning, right?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<scriptdevil>	can anyone temme if i need to change my repos in order to upgrade my distro??? i dont get the option of upgrading in update manager
[neutral]	[05:25]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, swap at the end
[negative]	[05:25]	<arang2>	IntuitiveNipple: where do i get the patch? pls link
[negative]	[05:25]	<DanMulvey>	for some reason proprietary drivers don't want to install for me (im a noob) any advice on how to get them (nvidia and wireless card)
[neutral]	[05:25]	<moDumasser>	hey all
[neutral]	[05:25]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Beginning... it relates to the 'beginning' of free space
[neutral]	[05:25]	<joanki>	and use as?
[neutral]	[05:25]	<joanki>	ext3?
[negative]	[05:25]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: nope, as soon as I make one default, the other one becomes disabled. There is never any secondary option
[positive]	[05:26]	<arang2>	Vlet: i need to run it again to tell u the error
[neutral]	[05:26]	<joanki>	oh man two conflicting answers
[neutral]	[05:26]	<joanki>	one says end another says beginning
[neutral]	[05:26]	<emanuel>	Hey, have anyone here installed 7.10 in a Compaq F500 yet?
[neutral]	[05:26]	<inigomontoya>	c_plus_plus: do compiz --replace again
[neutral]	[05:26]	<astro76>	joanki, I'd put the swap first, closest to the middle
[positive]	[05:26]	<noor>	SWEET it worked XD
[negative]	[05:26]	<moDumass>	sorry my bad, im already here
[negative]	[05:26]	<joanki>	ok
[negative]	[05:26]	<IntuitiveNipple>	arang2: You'd need to Google for it, I used it a while ago now
[negative]	[05:26]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: ok
[neutral]	[05:26]	<jotil>	joanki, doesn't matter. pick one.
[positive]	[05:26]	<astro76>	Ashfire908, swap in the middle means less head thrashing, I've started using that ;)
[negative]	[05:26]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, swap as swap. the root ( / ) as ext3
[positive]	[05:26]	<joanki>	and also, use as? ext3, ext2, reiserfs, jfs, xfs, fat16, fat32, swap, efi
[neutral]	[05:26]	<arang2>	IntuitiveNipple: could u suggest me a few strings to google it easier?
[neutral]	[05:26]	<joanki>	i put swap in
[negative]	[05:26]	<joanki>	ok
[positive]	[05:26]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: If it is the swap you are creating, then the type is swap :)
[neutral]	[05:26]	<joanki>	THANKJ YOU
[negative]	[05:26]	<moDumass>	hey so i uninstalled ktorrent and installed deluge since google said its cooler in Gnome, and i started it up, now its gone
[negative]	[05:26]	<martyvis>	astro76: but she aint gonna swap -
[neutral]	[05:27]	<joanki>	PHEW that part is done!
[positive]	[05:27]	<Ashfire908>	astro better yet, another hard drive :D
[neutral]	[05:27]	<joanki>	now i must do the root
[negative]	[05:27]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: and your using a ATI Radeon? hmm sounds like your video card has some Firmware or Software that lets you change it in its program
[positive]	[05:27]	<jisatsu>	I changed the Qt theme with qtconfig, but when I start Filelight, it uses different colours. any idea how to change that?
[negative]	[05:27]	<mechdave>	what was the X config tool again for the CLI 7.04?
[positive]	[05:27]	<astro76>	martyvis, oh I know, I'd make the swap 512 max if not hibernating ;)
[negative]	[05:27]	<joanki>	do i want a home partition?
[positive]	[05:27]	<scriptdevil>	DanMulvey: well.. doesnt the restricted drivers option in system show them to you?
[negative]	[05:27]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: have you tried reconfigureing the xserver?
[neutral]	[05:27]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: ahhh... you've gone the 'manual' not guided route have you?
[negative]	[05:27]	<oxeimon>	ShadowMinds: How do I do that, xrandr?
[negative]	[05:27]	<joanki>	guided route was trying ot take over all 80 GBs
[neutral]	[05:27]	<scriptdevil>	joanki: it is recommended.. but you can have one huge / and forget the rest
[neutral]	[05:27]	<foug>	is the Xscreensaver that's in the Ubuntu repo's the same one in Debian's?
[neutral]	[05:27]	<joanki>	i coujldn't let it do that
[negative]	[05:27]	<edward>	what program is suppost to open .bin files
[neutral]	[05:27]	<edward>	?
[negative]	[05:27]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: It is a good idea, yes...
[negative]	[05:27]	<joanki>	ok
[negative]	[05:27]	<Ashfire908>	joanki, you don't need a /home partition
[negative]	[05:27]	<DanMulvey>	scriptdevil: I tried that, but it gives me an error saying they aren't installed when i try to enable them
[negative]	[05:27]	<moDumass>	whats the easiest way to dload torrents in ubuntu?
[negative]	[05:28]	<scriptdevil>	edward: it just runs ./filename.bin
[neutral]	[05:28]	<george_>	just create a swap and a / partition
[negative]	[05:28]	<Dialntone>	that kino isn't very friendly.. :( doesn't even play .avi files...
[negative]	[05:28]	<george_>	call it a day
[neutral]	[05:28]	<mechdave>	edward, Usually they are bash scripts
[neutral]	[05:28]	<joanki>	how big should home partition be?
[neutral]	[05:28]	<c_plus_plus>	inigomontoya: @HLINK
[negative]	[05:28]	<ShadowMinds>	Oxeimon: i'm not sure how you reconfigure the xserver in Gutsy, haven't used ubuntu but for a few weeks
[negative]	[05:28]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: ... best thing is to create a root of about 10-12GB, and the rest as /home - it makes upgrading releases later a *lot* easier
[neutral]	[05:28]	<scriptdevil>	DanMulvey: well.. have a net connection
[neutral]	[05:28]	<scriptdevil>	??
[negative]	[05:28]	<edward>	"""./file"" doesn't work for me anymore"
[negative]	[05:28]	<DanMulvey>	yeah
[negative]	[05:28]	<Dialntone>	Bad edward...
[negative]	[05:28]	<Dialntone>	bad..
[neutral]	[05:28]	<mechdave>	edward, make sure it is executable
[negative]	[05:28]	<joanki>	would it be ok if i set it to 16000MB for root and then the 20000 MB for home?
[positive]	[05:28]	<Ubuntu101>	"Interesting issue with compiz when installing ubuntu-desktop from Xubuntu 7.10.

[positive]	[05:29]	<DanMulvey>	scriptdevil: thanks ill try again
[negative]	[05:29]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: You'd never use 16GB for root (I develop Ubuntu kernel and I only have 12GB)
[negative]	[05:29]	<martyvis>	joanki: sounds ok - just don't rip too many DVDs
[negative]	[05:29]	<astro76>	joanki, it would be fine, except you might be able to have a bigger /home, don't forget all your user files go on /home

[neutral]	[06:00]	<subpar>	has anyone had luck networking a vista box and an ubuntu box?
[negative]	[06:00]	<Vlet>	nj786: yes. I thought you were asking for a way to do it from the commandline
[negative]	[06:00]	<nrdb>	arghh2d2, wouldn't that just be a line in the /etc/fstab file ?
[positive]	[06:00]	<chowmeined>	limecat: LVM adds complexity and it requires to have an init ramdrive... no you cant disable encryption
[negative]	[06:00]	<extrakick>	would it be ok to uninstall any kd3 module, im assuming that is was is conflicint with gnome, although im very new to linux so im not sure
[negative]	[06:00]	<allobjects>	If I run  the upgrade to 7.10 via update-manager will it automatically use the existing apt-cacher setup on my network ?
[negative]	[06:00]	<krammer>	yes me subpar
[neutral]	[06:00]	<nj786>	Vlet: no i was just asking what would be the safest and best option
[negative]	[06:00]	<subpar>	how did you do it?
[neutral]	[06:01]	<fit4lfe>	@HLINK
[negative]	[06:01]	<WGGMk>	jotil: wouldnt that change it permanitly so all requests are thru the specific eth.. meaning i would have to change it back?
[negative]	[06:01]	<subpar>	did you do the samba 3.0 deal?
[negative]	[06:01]	<AudreyM>	scriptdevil: so, the standard installer with gutsy won't cut it?
[neutral]	[06:01]	<fit4lfe>	jrib @HLINK
[negative]	[06:01]	<asbani>	I installed pidentd. but i can't seem to be able to run the service, can somebody help me with that
[negative]	[06:01]	<Kousotu>	can someone answer a quick qustion reguarding ndiswrapper?
[negative]	[06:01]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: so why do you say you are using the wrong python version?
[positive]	[06:01]	<IntuitiveNipple>	scriptdevil: I have Vista dual-booting fine, GRUB just picked it up first time
[neutral]	[06:01]	<scriptdevil>	AudreyM: ask the others..
[negative]	[06:01]	<Vlet>	nj786: are you upgrading from feisty, or from a prerelease of gutsy?
[negative]	[06:01]	<arghh2d2>	nrdb, ?  what am i sposed to do to the line?
[negative]	[06:01]	<krammer>	what is the problem sub?
[neutral]	[06:01]	<nj786>	Vlet: fiesty
[negative]	[06:01]	<scriptdevil>	IntuitiveNipple: thats great... i am sorry if i misled you AudreyM
[positive]	[06:01]	<limecat>	chowmeined: is the added complexity generally worth it, in your opinion, or is it more hassel than its worth?  Also, can the encryption password ever be changed?
[neutral]	[06:01]	<Vlet>	!ask | Kousotu
[positive]	[06:01]	<ubotu>	Kousotu: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[negative]	[06:01]	<Ishidropi>	and_moi: the thing is that CDdrives make too much noise and running an ISO from HD is faster. i've always done this with Knoppix with the bootfrom command. but this apperently doesnt work with the Ubuntu LiveCD.
[neutral]	[06:01]	<Ap0ll0>	gusty compiz gone gay
[positive]	[06:02]	<Vlet>	nj786: then the recommended way is on that page I linked to
[neutral]	[06:02]	<nrdb>	arghh2d2, what device did you put the iso on ?
[positive]	[06:02]	<IntuitiveNipple>	scriptdevil: I think most problems are with 'non-standard' configurations with muitple disks
[neutral]	[06:02]	<jotil>	WGGMk: just change it back when you won't need it.
[positive]	[06:02]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i use LVM, it allows me to easily start with small partitions and resize them as my storage needs change

[negative]	[06:02]	<subpar>	krammar: well I can't really get into it right now, I'm about to leave... but my roomate's Vista laptop won't see my ubuntu box, and all the media is stored on my box
[negative]	[06:02]	<fit4lfe>	jrib cause I can't import pygtk anymore

[negative]	[06:03]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i guess i need to be more clear about the encryption.. the only one ive used is dmcrypt... and as far as I know, you cant change the password or disable the encryption
[negative]	[06:03]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: did you do anything that you think may have caused this?
[negative]	[06:03]	<Ubuntu101>	Ok, does anyone have a rough idea of how many downloads of ubuntu 7.10 there have been? compared to 7.04?
[neutral]	[06:03]	<fit4lfe>	yes installed pylons
[negative]	[06:03]	<WGGMk>	jotil: thanks i figured i would have to do something similar.. how do i determine the default gateway.. is it shown in ifconfig?
[neutral]	[06:03]	<jotil>	WGGMk: to change the name: @HLINK
[neutral]	[06:03]	<fit4lfe>	jrib yes installed pylons
[neutral]	[06:03]	<krammer>	 can u see the bootloader?
[positive]	[06:03]	<Vlet>	Ubuntu101: more :)
[negative]	[06:03]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i mean the method to do both would be to copy the data to another partition and then replace the previous
[neutral]	[06:03]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: how?
[neutral]	[06:03]	<Kousotu>	"the proper driver asigner for infs is ""sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver here>"" right?"

[negative]	[06:03]	<limecat>	chowmeined: i see, thanks.  So with LVM i can change the size of even an ext3 root partition?
[neutral]	[06:04]	<Allenwr>	anyone know how much space knoppix requires?
[negative]	[06:04]	<and_moi>	Ishidropi, hmm...If you've done the same from knoppix it should be similar for *buntu..those 'cheatcodes' are pure kernel and grub stuff...not distro specific. What error are you getting? My only concern is that if you're not booting from grub...how are you even entering those for NT loader?
[neutral]	[06:04]	<Vlet>	!upgrade | [Trash]_

[negative]	[06:04]	<subpar>	krammer, no, can't see anything... we worked around it since I dual boot, but I really hate being in windows unless I'm working in proprietary software
[positive]	[06:04]	<[Trash]_>	excellent! thank you!
[positive]	[06:04]	<chowmeined>	limecat: its a two step process
[neutral]	[06:04]	<jotil>	WGGMk: just type: route
[neutral]	[06:04]	<krammer>	allen google is your friend or go to the site
[negative]	[06:04]	<n2diy>	Allenwr: Knoppix 3.6 uses about 3 gig.
[neutral]	[06:04]	<nj786>	Vlet: ?
[positive]	[06:04]	<jotil>	WGGMk: it will show you the routing table
[negative]	[06:04]	<chowmeined>	limecat: LVM is just the logical volume.. which you can shrink and grow online at any time
[neutral]	[06:04]	<nrdb>	arghh2d2, you can also use the mount command to do it manually.
[positive]	[06:04]	<chowmeined>	limecat: however, you also need to change the size of the filesystem (in your case ext3)
[negative]	[06:04]	<Allenwr>	ok, so to be safe, just go with 5 gigs for 5.1.1?
[negative]	[06:04]	<Wolf23>	somebody help please!
[neutral]	[06:05]	<Vlet>	nj786: what?
[negative]	[06:05]	<chowmeined>	limecat: ext3 can be grown online.. but it can only be shrunk offline
[positive]	[06:05]	<Ishidropi>	and_moi: i'm booting from GRUB. GRUB4WIN has been adapted to run off NTFS drives and thus enabling easy linux booting from the NT loader via GRUB
[positive]	[06:05]	<limecat>	"chowmeined: thats fine with me :D  one last question, is there any real benefit, with this new ""5% reserved"" space on the drive, to having a seperate /home and /?"
[negative]	[06:05]	<extrakick>	can the installation of kde modules mess up a gnome based ubutnu, im  new to linx
[negative]	[06:05]	<nj786>	Vlet: i mean i do not understand whether to update from UPDATE MANAGER or WWW.UBUNTU.COM
[negative]	[06:05]	<krammer>	Reinstall it again if you do not have any imparative data
[negative]	[06:05]	<chowmeined>	limecat: so to shrink root you'd need to do with from a livecd
[negative]	[06:05]	<AudreyM>	Can someone give me some assistance with the proper partitioning procedure to keep my vista install?
[positive]	[06:05]	<mboso>	does the 2.6.20 kernel support booting using a UUID label in grub?
[positive]	[06:05]	<n2diy>	Allenwr: Don't know, I'm a Ubuntu user now! :)
[neutral]	[06:05]	<Vlet>	nj786: again...
[negative]	[06:05]	<astro76>	extrakick, no it's perfectly fine

[neutral]	[06:05]	<fit4lfe>	jrib think of pickle for php
[neutral]	[06:05]	<briantumor>	where can i get fluxubuntu?
[neutral]	[06:05]	<arghh2d2>	nrdb, do you think grub boot partitions listed in fstab?

[negative]	[06:06]	<chowmeined>	limecat: that 5% is root only.. basically it prevents some random program from filling up your drive and causing system components to fail
[neutral]	[06:06]	<Allenwr>	ubuntu, knoppix, fedora, and mandrake
[negative]	[06:06]	<arghh2d2>	nrdb, do you think grub can only boot partitions listed in fstab?
[positive]	[06:06]	<fit4lfe>	jrib by peak
[negative]	[06:06]	<limecat>	joanki: probably that the servers are suffering, happened to me, i just tried again later
[negative]	[06:06]	<and_moi>	Ishidropi, ok sorry. Well the same command should work in ubuntu. What's the error?
[negative]	[06:06]	<Vlet>	nj786: read the page
[negative]	[06:06]	<agwells>	can anyone help me... USB PORTS fail to start new device....only during the first few seconds, so long as i do not unplug the device, the device works.. but if i unplug the device it will not start...
[neutral]	[06:06]	<Dupont>	anyone know?
[negative]	[06:06]	<n2diy>	Allenwr: GL, let us know what you find out?
[neutral]	[06:06]	<Allenwr>	k
[neutral]	[06:06]	<chowmeined>	limecat: with today's hard drives you could probably lower it to 1%
[neutral]	[06:06]	<smy1220>	Can someone assist with Desktop Icons
[neutral]	[06:06]	<joanki>	limecat: you tried installing again later? or you went to the website to download it later?
[negative]	[06:06]	<limecat>	chowmeined: which happened once with torrent.  So is there any benefit to having a seperate /home with this feature?
[negative]	[06:06]	<nrdb>	arghh2d2, no it does look at the fstab for booting.
[negative]	[06:06]	<Allenwr>	the reason why I am asking is because I am going to fit it all on a 40 gig drive
[negative]	[06:06]	<asbani>	how to check the services that are already running
[negative]	[06:06]	<limecat>	joanki: i tried the update later, and could connect
[neutral]	[06:06]	<jimmygoon>	When TrueCrypt mounts my drive, my normal user doesn't have file access to it
[negative]	[06:06]	<Ishidropi>	and_moi: you are right about the cheatcodes, they are kernel params, but it wont let me startup the CD in LiveCD modus, it skips immidiatly to the Install screen.
[neutral]	[06:06]	<chowmeined>	limecat: afaik, the 5% thing has been around for a long long time
[negative]	[06:06]	<limecat>	servers are just hurting
[negative]	[06:06]	<joanki>	ok so i just have to go to the website and download them later, right?
[neutral]	[06:06]	<arghh2d2>	nrdb: it does or does not?
[negative]	[06:07]	<limecat>	what are you trying to dl, joanki?  the ISO?
[neutral]	[06:07]	<chowmeined>	limecat: but.. i like having a separate /home because then you can do clean installs but still keep your data
[positive]	[06:07]	<jotil>	WGGMk: using the route command. google a bit. there should be many examples.
[neutral]	[06:07]	<ToddED1>	anyone play FPS's under linux?
[neutral]	[06:07]	<Wolf23>	help please!
[neutral]	[06:07]	<joanki>	i am installing gusty
[neutral]	[06:07]	<Kousotu>	sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver>   is this correct?
[negative]	[06:07]	<chowmeined>	limecat: or if you want to change distros
[neutral]	[06:07]	<n2diy>	Allenwr: 40g should handle the OSes.
[neutral]	[06:07]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: no, it'll do that for you automatically... all the servers are suffering at peak times with high load
[positive]	[06:07]	<WGGMk>	jotil: ok thanks bud, i appreciate the help and the link
[positive]	[06:07]	<limecat>	chowmeined: yea, except ive decided ima do a clean install each upgrade---i screw WAY too much up every 6 months :D
[negative]	[06:07]	<nrdb>	arghh2d2, grub uses the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to know what to do, as far as I know that is the only config file it uses.
[negative]	[06:07]	<joanki>	ok so, no need to download secdurity updates, ssystem will do it for me
[neutral]	[06:07]	<joanki>	right?
[negative]	[06:07]	<Ishidropi>	and_moi: when i started the same ISO in QEMU, it started fine as a liveCD, but that maybe because i set only the ISO to boot als CD in QEMU
[positive]	[06:07]	<chowmeined>	limecat: generally because LVM makes having lots of partitions clean and easy i have a / /boot /usr /var /tmp /home and swap
[neutral]	[06:07]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: you know pylons is packaged in ubuntu's repositories?
[positive]	[06:07]	<limecat>	alright, thanks for the info ^_^
[neutral]	[06:07]	<mechdave>	Wolf23: Just ask your question
[negative]	[06:08]	<Vlet>	joanki: if there are any, it'll let you know
[neutral]	[06:08]	<limecat>	er...why seperate tmp, var, etc?
[neutral]	[06:08]	<joanki>	ty
[neutral]	[06:08]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Yes, its part of the update-manager that checks for updates like windows does
[negative]	[06:08]	<joanki>	wow, this isn't easy
[negative]	[06:08]	<n2diy>	WGGMk: isn't WGGM a radio station in Boston?
[negative]	[06:08]	<arghh2d2>	nrdb: ok well then automounting is pointless then
[neutral]	[06:08]	<limecat>	doesnt that massively complicate things?
[negative]	[06:08]	<joanki>	i guess installing windows isn't always easy either
[negative]	[06:08]	<Allenwr>	n2diy: ok if I talk to you on PM?
[neutral]	[06:08]	<krammer>	Free you Mind
[positive]	[06:08]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Perfection rarely is :p
[neutral]	[06:08]	<Kousotu>	sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver>   is this correct?
[negative]	[06:08]	<zetheroo>	for some reason my fingerprint reader is no longer working
[positive]	[06:08]	<chowmeined>	limecat: right... so having a separate /home means you can just keep it, but reformat all the other partitions with the new distro's clean install.. without touching your /home stuff
[negative]	[06:08]	<joanki>	if i woulda straight installed, it woulda been easier
[negative]	[06:08]	<joanki>	but i had all those partitions
[negative]	[06:08]	<Vlet>	krammer: okay, will do
[negative]	[06:08]	<Wolf23>	mechdave:  thanx, but please can you help me how to update ubuntu7.10 coz i am using 7.04 x86 amd64? thanx
[negative]	[06:08]	<n2diy>	Allenwr: ok.
[negative]	[06:08]	<nj786>	Vlet: and by doing this i will not lose my files?
[negative]	[06:08]	<agwells>	HELP: has anyone figured out how to fix the issue with the usb drives, failing to reconize new devices after some time passes with the opperating system on.... this only happened in 7.10 on HP laptop??
[neutral]	[06:08]	<jared>	Does gusty use compiz?
[negative]	[06:08]	<joanki>	intuitive, you getting paid to be here?
[neutral]	[06:08]	<smy1220>	Any help with Desktop icons not working?
[negative]	[06:08]	<nrdb>	arghh2d2, I don't think it will help with the booting.
[neutral]	[06:08]	<zetheroo>	jared: yes
[positive]	[06:08]	<joanki>	because it's very nice of you otherwise to help so much
[neutral]	[06:08]	<Kousotu>	sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver>   is this correct?
[positive]	[06:08]	<Vlet>	nj786: you will not - it's just like an update, but more complex
[neutral]	[06:08]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: no, everyone here are volunteers with some free time

[neutral]	[06:09]	<IntuitiveNipple>	arang2: yes, it is discouraged
[neutral]	[06:09]	<alien18>	why?
[negative]	[06:09]	<nj786>	Vlet: are you running 7.10?
[negative]	[06:09]	<and_moi>	Ishidropi, hmm...funny issue. Yeah, botting as a CD in QEMU would do the trick for that. Weird that it only brings you to the install screen when you boot from the ISO...Just outta curiosity...could you have grabbed the 'alternate' iso by any chance?
[neutral]	[06:09]	<joanki>	wow so nice
[negative]	[06:09]	<Vlet>	nj786: yep
[positive]	[06:09]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i like to separate them because, /tmp is world writable and i can set it noexec .. /var stores log files which can grow to large sizes sometimes, as well as all the html, databases etc... /usr should be fairly readonly so standard users cant tamper with it
[negative]	[06:09]	<smy1220>	Clean install of Gusty. open terminal type sudo gconf-editor ot to apps->nautilis->desktop heck off the: Computer, Trash, Network icons and nothing!!!! Reboot does not solve it!!! Is 7.10 using a different location for this setting?

[neutral]	[06:10]	<Kousotu>	sudo ndiswrapper -i <driver>   is this correct?
[positive]	[06:10]	<chowmeined>	limecat: it may not be as useful on a standard desktop machine
[negative]	[06:10]	<bbrown>	I Just got gutsy and firefox is a mess.  Anybody else having a problem with Firefox. I already had opera, I guess I need to use that more
[negative]	[06:10]	<fit4lfe>	jrib yes but this was before they updated to the new versino
[positive]	[06:10]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: The first of those
[negative]	[06:10]	<fit4lfe>	jrib how can i fix this
[neutral]	[06:10]	<joanki>	thx
[negative]	[06:10]	<agwells>	Kousotu: yeah there are also programs to do that for you...
[negative]	[06:10]	<ShakaGoldSaint>	nrdb, you mean the fdisk tool for windows?
[negative]	[06:11]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Recovery is for if you have some major problems at any time
[neutral]	[06:11]	<Wolf23>	jrib:  thanx , but i read the site, and i need someone to help me with it, thanx
[negative]	[06:11]	<limecat>	chowmeined: yea, i may just do the /tmp, not sure on /home
[neutral]	[06:11]	<joanki>	would it be correct to say that ubuntu is a linux-based operating system?
[negative]	[06:11]	<nrdb>	ShakaGoldSaint, no Linux, same name.
[neutral]	[06:11]	<agwells>	Kousotu but <driver> needs to point to the file.inf
[negative]	[06:11]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: ok... what does 'readlink -f $(which python)' return?
[positive]	[06:11]	<chowmeined>	limecat: but for power users.. and on servers.. it provides additional security (you can set nosuid, noexec, ro, options per mount) as well as allowing you to use a different filesystem depending on how that mount will be used
[negative]	[06:11]	<limecat>	i REALLY screw things up, even wine, so my .wine is shot\
[negative]	[06:11]	<Kousotu>	agwells: yea, but I only have 1 with which I need ndis for
[neutral]	[06:11]	<jrib>	Wolf23: what is your questionL
[negative]	[06:11]	<n2diy>	joanki: yes, it would.
[negative]	[06:11]	<ShakaGoldSaint>	nrdb, what does that do? how can i use it?
[neutral]	[06:11]	<joanki>	thx
[neutral]	[06:11]	<Kousotu>	and I knew thst
[neutral]	[06:11]	<Kousotu>	that*
[negative]	[06:11]	<and_moi>	Ishidropi, sorry, I'm outta ideas. It really shouldn't be a boot option/kernel param because the live/desktop iso should boot into the live environment and then give you the chance to install. There's not really an override for that to bring you straight to an install
[neutral]	[06:11]	<arghh2d2>	nrdb brb
[negative]	[06:11]	<limecat>	even my home folder needs to go, i back up the data and format :\
[negative]	[06:11]	<joanki>	it looks like an apple interface (desktop i mean)
[negative]	[06:11]	<jared>	joanki, ubuntu IS Linux. Linux is linux...and ubuntu is just a distro OF linux. Suse is a distro...redhat etc.
[negative]	[06:11]	<TBird>	joakim-: in as much as there is no 'linux' operating system, just a kernel, sure.
[neutral]	[06:11]	<Spisters>	joanki, Ubuntu is linux
[neutral]	[06:11]	<fit4lfe>	jrib in python do thtat
[negative]	[06:12]	<chowmeined>	limecat: thats fair.. you could still keep them separate.. you wont lose anything
[negative]	[06:12]	<freaker>	does anyone knows the name of the panel in this clip @HLINK   ?
[negative]	[06:12]	<agwells>	Kousotu so whats the question?
[neutral]	[06:12]	<BlaenkDenum>	!mountwindows
[neutral]	[06:12]	<ubotu>	ntfs is To view your Windows/Mac partitions see @HLINK .  For NTFS write access see !ntfs-3g or !fuse
[neutral]	[06:12]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: in a shell (not python)
[negative]	[06:12]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i just do it out of habit
[neutral]	[06:12]	<n2diy>	Spisters: that is not correct.
[positive]	[06:12]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Yes, it is a GNU/Linux distribution :)
[negative]	[06:12]	<Kousotu>	I wanted to make sure I had the command right
[negative]	[06:12]	<joanki>	oh
[negative]	[06:12]	<Wolf23>	jrib:  how can i update ubuntu7.10, coz i am using now ubuntu7.04 x86 amd64, tell me what commands i have to type?
[neutral]	[06:12]	<nrdb>	ShakaGoldSaint, have you the LiveCD going ?
[negative]	[06:12]	<joanki>	i'm learning so much these days i cant keep it straght!
[negative]	[06:12]	<Kousotu>	because I need it for my internet driver

[neutral]	[06:12]	<Lustblader>	lulz @ joanki
[positive]	[06:12]	<Spisters>	Linux is an umbrella term for a variety of open source distros like this one,
[negative]	[06:12]	<chowmeined>	limecat: actually what i have setup on mine is... i did LVM for all the system's / /tmp /usr /var and swap.. but i did software RAID 1 for /home
[neutral]	[06:12]	<jrib>	Wolf23: the page explains that
[negative]	[06:12]	<ShakaGoldSaint>	nrdb, yep, i'm using it right now
[positive]	[06:12]	<Ishidropi>	and_moi: apparently there is, but thanks anyway. i'll go fiddle around some more. have a nice day ;)
[neutral]	[06:13]	<agwells>	if you just type in ndiswrapper tells you the commands.. you also need to do a modprobe ndiswrapper
[negative]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	What options do I pass mount to allow user read/write/
[negative]	[06:13]	<extrakick>	astro76,thats weird because i reccently instaled AcetoneISO2, and it didnt do wat i wanted so i uninstalled it, but i didnt know exactly what other kde dependencies it installed
[neutral]	[06:13]	<manjunath>	thank you script
[neutral]	[06:13]	<limecat>	chowmeined: now THERES a thought o.0
[neutral]	[06:13]	<Kousotu>	I was aware of that as wel
[neutral]	[06:13]	<Ishidropi>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[06:13]	<Kousotu>	well*
[negative]	[06:13]	<and_moi>	Ishidropi, hope you find it, sorry I couldn't help. The forums might provide the answer
[neutral]	[06:13]	<jrib>	Wolf23: what part of the instructions on the wiki page are not clear?
[neutral]	[06:13]	<Lustblader>	!chmod | jimmygoon

[negative]	[06:13]	<optiq>	hey, does anyone know a good security tut/primer for ubuntu?
[negative]	[06:13]	<Wolf23>	jrib:  are u free for me, coz i am newbie on this, pleasee
[negative]	[06:13]	<freaker>	i mean the bottom panel from the clip.. ?
[negative]	[06:13]	<extrakick>	since i uninstalled it, things have been freezin which never used to, or ubuntu would just stop responding
[neutral]	[06:13]	<joanki>	one last question
[neutral]	[06:13]	<agwells>	So anyone know a fix for the USB issue.....
[negative]	[06:13]	<Spisters>	did anyone else have an issue with minimizing windows after the update?
[negative]	[06:13]	<Falstius>	what do people use for latex?  I was using auctex with emacs21, but it doesn't work with emacs22 (I could regress, or modify some system files but I figure that if this isn't supported its because there is a better way)
[neutral]	[06:13]	<fit4lfe>	jrib readlink -f $(python2.5)
[positive]	[06:13]	<chowmeined>	limecat: it works fairly well.. even though my drives are different sizes.. (320GB and 160GB).. the software raid is flexible enough to let me do it efficiently
[negative]	[06:13]	<nrdb>	ShakaGoldSaint, just checking, do you know what device your HDD is ?
[negative]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	Lustblader, not quite what I wanted. I know how to use chmod... I was loking for mount options :S
[neutral]	[06:13]	<jimmygoon>	!mount

[neutral]	[06:13]	<hendrixski>	is there a guide written yet for how to solve graphics card issues in Gutsy?
[neutral]	[06:14]	<agwells>	TEXMAKER
[neutral]	[06:14]	<fit4lfe>	jrib like that
[neutral]	[06:14]	<limecat>	wait, do you have to LVM both drives?
[neutral]	[06:14]	<Vlet>	Wolf23: if you have questions, ask them here.
[negative]	[06:14]	<jrib>	fit4lfe: ok... what does 'readlink -f $(which python)' return?
[negative]	[06:14]	<fit4lfe>	jrib nothing
[positive]	[06:14]	<limecat>	and how harsh on cpu is it
[neutral]	[06:14]	<agwells>	USB devices stop automounting after a certain time...
[negative]	[06:14]	<hendrixski>	because my graphics card seems to not be getting used. it's all going to the CPU.... how do I fix this?
[negative]	[06:14]	<n2diy>	optiq: what security concerns do you have?
[neutral]	[06:14]	<Vlet>	Wolf23: that way, the question is out there for everyone to potentially answer
[negative]	[06:14]	<Ishidropi>	and_moi: i could find nothing in the forums, thats why i came here. if i'm still at a loss after retry. i'll just post it in the forums and see what happens
[negative]	[06:14]	<chowmeined>	limecat: no i have LVM on 1/2 of the 320GB.. and then raid 1 on the 160GB and the other half

[neutral]	[06:14]	<BlaenkDenum>	hendrixski: get the drivers
[negative]	[06:14]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Not by default, but there *is* an ext3 file-system driver for Windows... Google should help you locate it
[neutral]	[06:14]	<fit4lfe>	jrib k
[negative]	[06:14]	<optiq>	I just wanted to know what were some basic steps i should take with this destroy beyond installing firestarter etc.
[negative]	[06:14]	<Bax>	does ubuntu come with a firewall pre-installed or some safety internet connection stuff?  If so how can I access it and/or modify it?

[negative]	[06:14]	<jrib>	Wolf23: sure, just let me know what part of the wiki page is not clear
[negative]	[06:15]	<limecat>	this will be interesting o.0
[neutral]	[06:15]	<joanki>	Intuitive, but i CAN access windows' files, right?
[negative]	[06:15]	<chowmeined>	limecat: unless im copying huge files around... in which case its a bit slower
[neutral]	[06:15]	<agwells>	unplug usb device replug in

[positive]	[06:15]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Yes, from Ubuntu. By default Gutsy installs the ntfs-3g driver that gives read/write access to Windows file-systems
[neutral]	[06:15]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i haven't messed with those
[negative]	[06:15]	<Wolf23>	jrib:  i dont like to put my hand and make errors :(
[negative]	[06:15]	<limecat>	alright
[negative]	[06:15]	<extrakick>	 astro76,thats weird because i reccently instaled AcetoneISO2, and it didnt do wat i wanted so i uninstalled it, but i didnt know exactly what other kde dependencies it installed
[negative]	[06:15]	<Falstius>	agwells: that looks interesting, I'll look into it.  Does it have nice keyboard shortcuts like emacs?
[positive]	[06:15]	<limecat>	thanks for all the info :)
[neutral]	[06:15]	<chowmeined>	limecat: thats another benefit though.. you can tune them for each mount

[neutral]	[06:15]	<nrdb>	ShakaGoldSaint, is this a new drive ?
[negative]	[06:15]	<jrib>	Wolf23: then ask if you are not sure about something
[neutral]	[06:16]	<BlaenkDenum>	ubotu: you there
[neutral]	[06:16]	<joanki>	Lustblader, if i place the file inside the sda2 file drive, windows should be able to access it, no?

[negative]	[06:16]	<Spisters>	joanki, no not unless you go find the program that will allow you to see the format that Ubuntu uses
[neutral]	[06:16]	<agwells>	yes... and customizable ones too
[negative]	[06:16]	<hendrixski>	looks like ubotu is on vacation
[negative]	[06:16]	<astro76>	extrakick, yes I read that and asked what is weird? Are you saying the remaining kde libs are causing problems?
[negative]	[06:16]	<freaker>	does anyone knows the name of the bottom panel in this clip @HLINK   ?
[negative]	[06:16]	<BlaenkDenum>	what's with the bot

[neutral]	[06:16]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Having said that, I've not used the Vista partition in about 6 months
[negative]	[06:16]	<chowmeined>	limecat: i dont remember the term now.. but basically i have a bunch of 10GB raw images.. that are mostly empty
[neutral]	[06:16]	<joanki>	wow
[neutral]	[06:16]	<FX_>	This is cool. I just installed ubuntu on my macbook pro and it runs llike a champ

[negative]	[06:17]	<limecat>	chowmeined: ive heard it  unstable compared to ext3.....also, one last question-i can set the disk up as 1gb /boot, the rest LVM'd, and then later decide i want a windows partition, and shrink the LVM?
[neutral]	[06:17]	<juan_>	hello all!
[negative]	[06:17]	<Falstius>	agwells: texmaker is so limiting, and no preview function :(

[negative]	[06:20]	<astro76>	extrakick, I would tend to go with the problem being the AcetoneIso2 program which is not from the Ubuntu repos, as opposed to the KDE stuff which is

[positive]	[06:21]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: Hence why I use a Virtual Machine with Windows XP installed in it, for those times when I have to use Windows... saves dula-booting
[negative]	[06:21]	<and_moi>	dizy, default is 10/100 Mbps...you want 1kps or 1000Mbps?

[positive]	[06:21]	<IcemanV9>	juan_: just pick a different resolution (widescreen one)
[neutral]	[06:21]	<Lustblader>	joanki: vmware.com or sudo apt-get install wine
[negative]	[06:21]	<BlaenkDenum>	hendrixski: it's not that, it's just a terminal method
[neutral]	[06:21]	<racarter>	is there a repository for acroread?
[negative]	[06:21]	<BlaenkDenum>	hendrixski: so the same applies, it's not that you're actually running a feisty program on gutsy

[negative]	[06:22]	<Blu3>	i have 7.10 with 2.6.22-14-generic.  i just got a usb cellular card.  i need to modify the airprime module to add it's USB IDs.  what package(s) do i need to install so i have the source matching the current kernel?
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Vlet>	Wolf23: the instructions are already written out on the page we linked you to
[negative]	[06:22]	<BlaenkDenum>	hendrixski: it's just a different installation method

[neutral]	[06:22]	<n2diy>	fiXXXerMe1: on grubs man page?
[positive]	[06:22]	<Vlet>	joanki: pace yourself :)
[negative]	[06:22]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: There's a package called QEMU that emulates a PC, and can use hardware support if the PC's CPU has it to make it faster, or there's the commerical VMWare or there's VirtualBox etc
[neutral]	[06:22]	<Spisters>	you'll get it
[negative]	[06:22]	<KI4IKL>	How do I install compiz themes?

[neutral]	[06:23]	<oxeimon>	does anyone here have a dual monitor setup working on an ATI graphics card on 7.10?
[negative]	[06:23]	<and_moi>	dizy, some WAN drivers are already 1000Mbps...easiest thing is to check your kernel config (zcat /proc/config.gz > /some/file) to see if your driver is already at 1000mbps. Basically, if there's a driver available and your hardware's capable of it, it's already enabled
[negative]	[06:23]	<BlaenkDenum>	Lustblader: stick your middle finger into your wrist and yell 'shoot web!'
[negative]	[06:23]	<arghh2d2>	Lustblader: i know the small partition is called hda8 according to the results of command: fdisk -l

[negative]	[06:23]	<jumbers>	So since XMMS has been discontinued, what am I supposed to use?
[negative]	[06:23]	<IntuitiveNipple>	"joanki: If the CPU supports hardware VT, then there's a package called ""kvm"" that uses it (kvm is a customised qemu that uses the hardware VT)"
[negative]	[06:23]	<joanki>	oh cool!
[negative]	[06:23]	<Vlet>	joanki: I use irssi. it's a terminal based client

[negative]	[06:24]	<nrdb>	Reng, are you going to be access the external drive from Windows ?
[neutral]	[06:24]	<chowmeined>	limecat: then you can use them um.. setfacl tool to set them
[neutral]	[06:24]	<IntuitiveNipple>	joanki: the GNU tools which come as standard to build Linux apps
[neutral]	[06:25]	<IcemanV9>	juan_: yes. are you on gutsy? laptop or desktop?

[negative]	[06:48]	<craig22>	poningru: what would be better ? ext3

[negative]	[06:49]	<PurpZeY>	Madpilot: That I do know...I was just looking for a general consensus.... Arafangion: As much as that is good advice in any situation...It is not really calming in terms of facing an upgrade
[negative]	[06:49]	<craig22>	poningru: i just use them in amarok, so would they load fast still? on ext3
[negative]	[06:49]	<poningru>	brad016: install the compiz configuration thing

[neutral]	[06:50]	<craig22>	poningru: im at just under 100,00
[positive]	[06:50]	<riotkittie>	brad016: do you have ccsm installed? if not, go to System > Appearances, and you should be able to increase the # on one of the tabs there
[negative]	[06:50]	<poningru>	Jordan_U: does not work if you have compiz
[neutral]	[06:50]	<craig22>	poningru: 100,000

[neutral]	[06:51]	<poningru>	wubuntu: yeah search for thinkpad on wiki.ubuntu.com depending on your model its different
[negative]	[06:51]	<Jordan_U>	I am getting this error upgrading to Gutsy, @HLINK it doesn't go away no matter how many times I say yes, should I say no?
[neutral]	[06:51]	<poningru>	Jordan_U: looking

[neutral]	[06:53]	<zakman>	whts linux equivalent of chkdsk LETTER?
[neutral]	[06:53]	<Lustblader>	extrakick: it's beta and it's new.. so expected stuff all this
[negative]	[06:53]	<Jordan_U>	poningru, I also have apt-listbugs installed, but I don't think this is that
[neutral]	[06:53]	<riotkittie>	Lustblader: it's not beta
[neutral]	[06:53]	<poningru>	zakman: fsck
[neutral]	[06:53]	<adrifi>	/server irc.webchat.org
[negative]	[06:53]	<ferromag>	is it really possible to enable/disable hdd DMA?
[neutral]	[06:53]	<zakman>	thx
[negative]	[06:53]	<poningru>	Jordan_U: before you do that
[neutral]	[06:53]	<Ashfire908>	zakman, fsck DEVICE
[positive]	[06:53]	<IntuitiveNipple>	[chr0n0s]: mysql-server is a meta-package that will install the recommended mysql-server version when there is more than one version in the repositories
[neutral]	[06:53]	<zakman>	device being /dev/hd_?
[neutral]	[06:53]	<poningru>	do a sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[06:53]	<poningru>	and then sudo apt-get upgrade
[negative]	[06:53]	<wubuntu>	poningru: yeah, i know, but normally 'hotkey-setup' configures ist - don't wanna use 'tpb'
[negative]	[06:53]	<iStiKs>	no problems here with gutsy even got my theme to work properly off the bat
[negative]	[06:53]	<Madpilot>	ferromag, yes, but Ubuntu should have that set properly
[neutral]	[06:54]	<poningru>	wubuntu: oh dont know what to tell you dude
[positive]	[06:54]	<Jordan_U>	poningru, I am in the middle of the upgrade :)
[neutral]	[06:54]	<sledmouth>	Ashfire908: ls -s ?
[negative]	[06:54]	<ferromag>	anytime I've tried all I got was Inproper ioctl for device...
[neutral]	[06:54]	<wubuntu>	s***
[negative]	[06:54]	<limecat>	sledmouth: depends on your budget, what you like, and if youd use it for other things
[negative]	[06:54]	<extrakick>	poninfru, lustblader, ok kool, im new to linux, i thought new ubuntu wouldnt be released unless very stable
[negative]	[06:54]	<Jordan_U>	poningru, No package has been installed yet, but I don't think that it is a good idea to just quit
[negative]	[06:54]	<vali>	Hi... is there any way to change the default amarok behaviour when double-click a playlist?
[negative]	[06:55]	<poningru>	vali: you might have better help in #kubuntu
[positive]	[06:55]	<vali>	uhmm... youre right :P
[neutral]	[06:55]	<Ubuntu101>	extrakick its stable
[negative]	[06:55]	<SharkMa-san>	maybe you should try #amarok instead lol
[neutral]	[06:55]	<vali>	i forgot about #kubuntu
[neutral]	[06:55]	<iStiKs>	stable here
[neutral]	[06:55]	<zakman>	stable here

[positive]	[06:55]	<vali>	in #amarok all ppl seems to sleep xD
[negative]	[06:55]	<Sir_Sid>	why am I getting a message telling me to upgrade my distrobution to gutsy if I am using gutsy in the first place...
[positive]	[06:55]	<Jordan_U>	Not upgrading here ;)
[negative]	[06:56]	<xIke_>	ok, I tried editing my xorg.conf to add more buttons, but no luck.  clearly 4/5 are scroll up/down, but I can't seem to get results from 6/7
[negative]	[06:56]	<poningru>	anyone sticking around for halp?
[neutral]	[06:56]	<sledmouth>	can't tell much from 5 hour uptime...
[positive]	[06:56]	<IntuitiveNipple>	extrakick: There are a lways problems, whether issues to do with hardware config, user-misunderstanding, or previous configuration settings confusing updates. You have to remember that people generally don't come here to report a success, only a problem :)
[neutral]	[06:56]	<extrakick>	ubuntu101, but about all thee problems all these users are running into?
[neutral]	[06:56]	<zakman>	jordan.. your using gnome 2.18?
[positive]	[06:56]	<SharkMa-san>	vali: well, at least they answer... :P
[neutral]	[06:56]	<riotkittie>	Sir_Sid: did you install a beta? a rc?
[neutral]	[06:56]	<poningru>	xIke_: use the command xev test
[neutral]	[06:56]	<SharkMa-san>	when they're around
[negative]	[06:56]	<Sir_Sid>	riotkittie, nope. Torrented the the actual gutsy distro
[negative]	[06:56]	<Jordan_U>	"Sir_Sid, What does ""lsb_release -a"" say you are running?"
[negative]	[06:56]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	So, what could I do: Iphone in Virtual Box?
[positive]	[06:56]	<extrakick>	very true intuitivenipple
[negative]	[06:56]	<Adam>	anyone know of a way to mount norton ghost .v2i drives in ubuntu?
[positive]	[06:56]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	It connected the very first time when I did it for like 10 sec then stopped. . .

[negative]	[06:57]	<BlaenkDenum>	I'm trying to mount my windows partition but it says I don't have the privilege to do it, what should I do?
[negative]	[06:57]	<wubuntu>	why the ralink drivers don't work correctly in the new kernel? >:o
[neutral]	[06:57]	<Flynsarmy>	What's the difference between the gutsy alternative iso and the regular iso?
[negative]	[06:58]	<xIke_>	poningru, ok, it thinks my right two buttons are also 4/5, and doesn't even see my left two buttons
[negative]	[06:58]	<poningru>	akaishi: what do you mean blow it away?
[negative]	[06:58]	<Jordan_U>	I am getting this error upgrading to Gutsy, @HLINK it doesn't go away no matter how many times I say yes, should I say no?
[neutral]	[06:58]	<Sir_Sid>	BlaenkDenum, type sudo before you mount
[negative]	[06:58]	<PurpZeY>	BlaenkDenum: How are you trying to mount it?
[negative]	[06:58]	<xIke_>	poningru, nothing registers as 6/7
[neutral]	[06:58]	<riotkittie>	wubuntu: can you elaborate?
[negative]	[06:58]	<poningru>	xIke_: ooh that sucks
[negative]	[06:58]	<ubuntu>	somebody speak spanish..??
[neutral]	[06:58]	<biotrox>	enouf where r u..?
[negative]	[06:58]	<Sir_Sid>	BlaenkDenum, you may want to edit fstab to auto mount at boot
[negative]	[06:58]	<BlaenkDenum>	PurpZeY: GUI, just going into the drive and it automatically tries to mount
[neutral]	[06:58]	<poningru>	!es | ubuntu
[positive]	[06:58]	<[chr0n0s]>	thanks IntuitiveNipple
[negative]	[06:58]	<ubotu>	ubuntu: Si busca ayuda en Español por favor entre en los canales #ubuntu-es, #kubuntu-es o #edubuntu-es, allí obtendrá mas ayuda.
[negative]	[06:58]	<akaishi>	I did a dist-upgrade to (theoretically) edgy, and when the machine restarted, x failed to run
[negative]	[06:58]	<BlaenkDenum>	I added my line to fstab, how can I apply the mount right now?
[positive]	[06:58]	<Cable86>	Flynsarmy: the regular iso boots into a graphical environment, the alternate iso is simply a text-based installer
[neutral]	[06:58]	<BlaenkDenum>	Sir_Sid:
[negative]	[06:58]	<extrakick>	i was ready to upgrade to gutsy but wen i tried live my card wouldnt do desktop effects, so that really put me off, hahaha
[neutral]	[06:58]	<xIke_>	poningru, lol
[negative]	[06:58]	<riotkittie>	"Jordan_U: if ""yes"" isnt getting you anywhere, and you've done it repeatedly, then perhaps it's time you went with no"
[negative]	[06:58]	<BlaenkDenum>	Sir_Sid: I added the line to fstab, what's the command to re-mount or mount the drives?
[neutral]	[06:58]	<Jordan_U>	extrakick, What card?
[negative]	[06:59]	<poningru>	xIke_: dude what model is it?
[negative]	[06:59]	<wubuntu>	riotkittie: rt61pci crashes using synaptic/apt-get!
[neutral]	[06:59]	<Flynsarmy>	Is there any difference between the CD and DVD releases? Do DVD contain more packages?
[negative]	[06:59]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	What would I do people?
[negative]	[06:59]	<Sir_Sid>	hmm I actually forgot that one
[neutral]	[06:59]	<poningru>	you may wanna search google
[neutral]	[06:59]	<and_moi>	BlaenkDenum, mount 0a
[neutral]	[06:59]	<Neil3>	hey folks
[neutral]	[06:59]	<extrakick>	rdeon 9550, as far as i know it blacklisted for some reason
[neutral]	[06:59]	<xIke_>	poningru, razer diamondback

[neutral]	[06:59]	<PurpZeY>	BlaenkDenum: I've never done it that way...I just use NTS read
[negative]	[06:59]	<and_moi>	BlaenkDenum, sorry, mount -a
[negative]	[06:59]	<riotkittie>	wubuntu: lovely :( file a bug report?
[negative]	[06:59]	<akaishi>	so I've kind of got no idea now
[positive]	[06:59]	<Cable86>	Flynsarmy: yes, the dvd images contain more packages
[neutral]	[06:59]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	google provides no help. . .
[positive]	[06:59]	<extrakick>	jordan_u, but it works fine here on 7.04
[neutral]	[06:59]	<PurpZeY>	NFS*
[positive]	[06:59]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Well, no packages have actually been installed yet, so there is the third choice of backing out entirely and avoiding possible brickage :)
[neutral]	[06:59]	<wubuntu>	yeah, there is a bugreport for few weeks
[neutral]	[06:59]	<IcemanV9>	Flynsarmy: dvd = livecd + alternative altogether
[positive]	[07:00]	<riotkittie>	Jordan_U:  option #3 might be for the best
[negative]	[07:00]	<drama1981>	Flynsarmy dvd has more packages. they arent installed by default though. if you go to install something thats on the dvd it will ask for the disc instead of making you d/l it
[neutral]	[07:00]	<arun_>	Has anyone installed the Gnash plugin for Firefox?
[negative]	[07:00]	<Ubuntu101>	extrakick: well most of them are just normal problems with how to use various applications. Installing linux (what IntuitiveNipple was doing earlier) is always a hurdle, especially if you want to mess with partitions
[positive]	[07:00]	<Ubuntu101>	Others are drive problems, but I'm not seeing anything here such as it crashing computers or anything ;)
[neutral]	[07:00]	<riotkittie>	weird that it is doing that to you. hmmm.
[negative]	[07:00]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, :(
[negative]	[07:00]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	So what can I do?
[positive]	[07:00]	<Neil3>	just musing over this: i'm thinking about installing the 64bit version of ubuntu on my dell inspiron 6400 laptop, but is it worth it in terms of any performance benefits?
[negative]	[07:00]	<wubuntu>	why they can't fix it? that'S not what i expected from Ubuntu
[neutral]	[07:00]	<poningru>	arun_: yes
[negative]	[07:00]	<BlaenkDenum>	yeah, I just can't mount
[positive]	[07:01]	<arun_>	poningru: Does it work well for you?
[positive]	[07:01]	<Jordan_U>	"riotkittie, It is also saying ""The following 6 packages will be pinned or on hold: gij-4.2, libglade2-ruby1.8, ghostscript, libdb4.5, libpcrecpp0, texlive-latex-base"""
[neutral]	[07:01]	<iStiKs>	BlaenkDenum: sudo mount /dev/... /media/..
[positive]	[07:01]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Neil3: I've been running 64-bit since June with no problems, in fact I've been pleasantly surprised by the application support compared to Feisty
[negative]	[07:01]	<poningru>	Neil3: eh not really, especially if you like using proprietry stuff
[neutral]	[07:01]	<poningru>	arun_: well enough
[negative]	[07:01]	<BlaenkDenum>	seems to be working now nevermind
[neutral]	[07:01]	<poningru>	arun_: some flash sites still wont work
[positive]	[07:01]	<BlaenkDenum>	iStiKs: obviously not what I meant :P
[positive]	[07:01]	<poningru>	youtube works
[negative]	[07:01]	<extrakick>	ubuntu101, my bad i gues im just annoyed my card is blacklisted, lol
[negative]	[07:01]	<Neil3>	poningru, all i can think of that i use which is proprietary is java
[positive]	[07:01]	<poningru>	and similar sites work most of the time
[neutral]	[07:01]	<wers>	my openoffice.org's full screen mode can't be untoggled. what configuration file can I edit for that?
[neutral]	[07:01]	<poningru>	...
[positive]	[07:01]	<arun_>	anyone know how to disable the ugly right click menu for flash files?
[negative]	[07:01]	<poningru>	Neil3: thats not propreitry anymore
[negative]	[07:01]	<arun_>	disable = change its appearance to look more like gnome
[positive]	[07:02]	<poningru>	arun_: use gnash ;)
[positive]	[07:02]	<Neil3>	and gnash i've heard works pretty well?
[positive]	[07:02]	<Jordan_U>	"extrakick, Does X restart when you run ""glxinfo""? ( don't try it obviously unless you are prepared for X to crash :)"
[negative]	[07:02]	<poningru>	Neil3: yeah well enough
[negative]	[07:02]	<[chr0n0s]>	hey, will sudo aptitude remove xserver-xgl, will uninstall the pre-installed xserver-xgl ???
[negative]	[07:02]	<xIke_>	poningru, any ideas?
[negative]	[07:02]	<Cable86>	the java version installed by default in 7.10 is still proprietary...the free version is called iced tea and i don't believe it is ready for widespread use yet
[negative]	[07:02]	<poningru>	Neil3: yeah you may want to experiment
[positive]	[07:02]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Neil3: I use 64-bit + Java 1.6 + Eclipse Europa and it works perfectly
[neutral]	[07:02]	<wubuntu>	there is a solution: blacklist rt61pci, download and install rt61 from serialmonkey.com - that cannot be the truth - it's like in Debian ETch
[neutral]	[07:02]	<poningru>	xIke_: just google around to see if anyone has gotten it working before
[positive]	[07:02]	<Blama>	Does anyone know wher the actual plugin folder for firefox is? It is not at ~/.mozilla/plugins
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Anick>	can some one help me with my ati 9800 video card
[neutral]	[07:02]	<Cable86>	rather, it's not installed by default, but comes with ubuntu-restricted-extras
[negative]	[07:03]	<Neil3>	poningru, yeah just testing the water in here before i do, but the more i read, the more i wanna switch!
[negative]	[07:03]	<bone>	Anyone (besides me) have a problem installing perl modules (the initial make fails).
[negative]	[07:03]	<poningru>	xIke_: apart from that sorry dude
[neutral]	[07:03]	<biotrox>	!id
[neutral]	[07:03]	<ubotu>	join ke #ubuntu-id untuk membahas ubuntu dalam bahasa Indonesia
[negative]	[07:03]	<extrakick>	jordan_u, u mean in 7.04 or 7.10?
[negative]	[07:03]	<xIke_>	poningru, yeah, looking on google already, not optimistic.  thanks man
[neutral]	[07:03]	<Jordan_U>	extrakick, Either
[negative]	[07:03]	<poningru>	xIke_: the problem is your mouse doesnt seem to be sticking to normal standard methods of communicating with the computer
[positive]	[07:03]	<arun_>	poningru: you just said gnash doesn't work well on all websites :)
[neutral]	[07:03]	<poningru>	I am guessing even under windows it required its own drivers
[positive]	[07:03]	<Neil3>	poningru, i think it will help myself as I do video/audio transcoding/conversion quite a lot
[negative]	[07:03]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	Any ideas?
[positive]	[07:03]	<poningru>	arun_: right but it works well enough for me
[negative]	[07:04]	<BlaenkDenum>	hey guys I opened my windows drive and ubuntu automatically mounted it, but it doesn't show up in fstab, I'm guessing I can't be sure it'll always be automatically mounted?
[positive]	[07:04]	<MASTER_OF_THE_CH>	I need to unmount the iphone so its like brand new when I connect it again
[negative]	[07:04]	<Anick>	is any one having a problem with their ATI 9800 with ubuntu 7.10
[neutral]	[07:04]	<sledmouth>	does gnash work with games at all?
[negative]	[07:04]	<poningru>	BlaenkDenum: that auto mount thing is using gnome's own virtual file system thing
[negative]	[07:04]	<PurpZeY>	BlaenkDenum: Why the concern with fstab?
[negative]	[07:04]	<extrakick>	jordan_u, do i run that in terminal, sorry to ask im new to linx
[negative]	[07:04]	<arun_>	any other way to change the appearance of the flash right click menu?
[negative]	[07:05]	<BlaenkDenum>	PurpZeY: because I'm going to system link my firefox bookmarks from windows drive to linux, and I want to make sure it's automatically mounted on boot
[positive]	[07:05]	<Jordan_U>	extrakick, Yes, but only if you are prepared to have every GUI app you are currently running possibly quit ;)
[negative]	[07:05]	<poningru>	BlaenkDenum: you can make it read writable by you by just changing the ownership of the folder to you
[negative]	[07:05]	<BlaenkDenum>	PurpZeY: so what do you guys suggest I do
[positive]	[07:05]	<Blama>	Does anyone know wher the actual plugin folder for firefox is? It is not at ~/.mozilla/plugins
[negative]	[07:05]	<poningru>	BlaenkDenum: then I would say put into fstab
[neutral]	[07:05]	<virtuososteve_>	hey
[neutral]	[07:05]	<BlaenkDenum>	Blama: that folder applies to you heh
[neutral]	[07:05]	<poningru>	but thats a bit tricky
[negative]	[07:05]	<IntuitiveNipple>	BlaenkDenum: Gnome-Mount will automount hot-plugged drives if the option is set. If you want them to always appear on the same mount point then you'd need to add an entry to fstab that uses the device's UUID
[negative]	[07:05]	<virtuososteve_>	how can i get ubuntu 7.10?
[negative]	[07:05]	<BlaenkDenum>	poningru: but I don't know what I would put in that haha
[neutral]	[07:05]	<extrakick>	just done
[negative]	[07:05]	<akorn>	Does anybody know how to install Beryl on 7.10? I don't like Compiz
[neutral]	[07:06]	<Cable86>	!gutsy

[neutral]	[07:06]	<BlaenkDenum>	IntuitiveNipple: can you please help me with that?
[negative]	[07:06]	<poningru>	BlaenkDenum: because you have to use fuse/ntfs3g thing

[negative]	[07:06]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Meh, I am going to be an idiot and just say no ( I don't need those packages anyway, I just hope there won't be any dependency problems, and I guess I should just trust apt... )
[positive]	[07:06]	<klos>	i have a problem with my memory :-/
[neutral]	[07:06]	<klos>	@HLINK
[negative]	[07:06]	<BlaenkDenum>	Blama: go to irc.mozilla.org #firefox and ask them there, sorry I don't know :( but they're really smart over there

[neutral]	[07:07]	<zetheroo>	how happy is everyone?
[negative]	[07:07]	<bone>	Ok, now i'm confused. I rewrote my perl cpan config now it makes fine.. hehhe
[negative]	[07:07]	<Jordan_U>	extrakick, No, it's just that that is why cards are usually blacklisted, because a check can't be safely done to see if they would support compiz ( I have one such card, a SIS :( )
[positive]	[07:07]	<bone>	I'm always happy
[negative]	[07:07]	<Cable86>	klos: no, i have not had that problem at all
[neutral]	[07:07]	<riotkittie>	Jordan_U: i'll keep my fingers crossed for ya
[neutral]	[07:07]	<klos>	k thx
[positive]	[07:08]	<BlaenkDenum>	IntuitiveNipple: thanks, but what information would I need
[neutral]	[07:08]	<Anick>	Is any one having problems enabling their ATI drivers in the Restricted Driver
[positive]	[07:08]	<BlaenkDenum>	IntuitiveNipple: the UUID is CCDC3FAEDC3F9226, it's a Windows XP NTFS formatted partition

[negative]	[07:12]	<riotkittie>	Jordan_U: any chance you have a backup? i have sources.lst sources.lst~ and something else in my directory
[negative]	[07:13]	<riotkittie>	BlaenkDenum: you've tried mounting it manually?
[neutral]	[07:13]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, I have a backup, it's just dangerous for users that don't realize that the next application they install after a failed upgrade will basically half upgrade them to Gutsy

[negative]	[07:14]	<poningru>	GuHhH: ok gotcha
[neutral]	[07:15]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Hopefully not many, I think my problem with the upgrade itself may be somewhat my fault ( I have apt-get-listbugs installed )
[negative]	[07:15]	<poningru>	all that does is it forwards all data from 192.168.1.* to your port 80 to your port 8080
[positive]	[07:15]	<poningru>	well certain types of data
[negative]	[07:15]	<arang2>	guys anything is wrong with swiftfox? cos i cant access the page?

[positive]	[07:19]	<arang2>	Jordan_U:but the original site is down?
[neutral]	[07:19]	<tux97_>	hi
[negative]	[07:20]	<Jordan_U>	arang2, I dont know, and I personally don't care, swiftfox violates the MPL and is probably not even much faster
[negative]	[07:20]	<Vantage13>	hi.  After I brought my laptop running gutsy out of hibernate it kept prompting for the gnome-keyring password.  Eventually I hit cancel and the prompt went away.  Since then I have been unable to get wireless going and it no longer prompts me for my gnome-keyring password upon login.  Any idea how I can get this going again?
[positive]	[07:20]	<extrakick>	will software that work don 7.10 still work on 7.10?

[neutral]	[07:21]	<Jordan_U>	arang2, Control in what way?
[negative]	[07:21]	<akaishi>	I need an apt-get fixitalready command
[neutral]	[07:21]	<arang2>	Jordan_U: it's always there eating my processor
[neutral]	[07:22]	<arang2>	Jordan_U: like 50%

[negative]	[07:24]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Trying the upgrade again now with apt-listbugs removed, hopefully that was the only problem

[negative]	[07:26]	<todkon>	ActySofts: neither of your soundcards work either though?

[negative]	[07:26]	<Vantage13>	IntuitiveNipple: but I'm still not getting prompted for the keyring and can't get wireless going again...
[negative]	[07:26]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Vantage13: Hmm, try hacking through the settings using gconf in the /apps section... I bet there's a gnome setting somewhere doing it
[negative]	[07:26]	<josss>	it say cannot view in this display mode
[negative]	[07:26]	<arghh2d2>	Can anyone assist me in getting grub to load 7.10 install disk from a partition instead of a cdrom?
[negative]	[07:26]	<lwizardl>	can i remove lost+found from a sda drive?
[negative]	[07:26]	<riotkittie>	Jordan_U: hopefully it goes much better for you this time around. are the repos still miserably slow?
[neutral]	[07:27]	<Blama>	Jordan_U, it won't let me check it off
[negative]	[07:27]	<Jordan_U>	riotkittie, Not nearly as bad
[negative]	[07:27]	<ActySofts>	todkon: yep, and there's no option like that in my bios (I can't make anything out of italian though), but they both work on windoze and they did work before
[negative]	[07:27]	<scguy318>	josss: an X error? have you tried safe graphics mode?
[positive]	[07:27]	<Neutrinux>	Jordan_U: they are in sources.list.save (what is that? adept manager thing?)
[neutral]	[07:27]	<josss>	scguy318: no
[neutral]	[07:28]	<riotkittie>	ahh. i'll have to pop a CD in and try installing to my external later then.
[negative]	[07:28]	<ActySofts>	todkon: I'm using xubuntu btw, but I guess it doesn't really matter, the core is the same
[negative]	[07:28]	<DanMulvey>	alright, i have a broadcom wireless in my laptop, any advice on getting this thing working?
[neutral]	[07:28]	<Jordan_U>	Neutrinux, No idea, I just know that other sources can be defined in other files
[negative]	[07:28]	<Blama>	Jordan_U, It will not let me download Macromedia Flash Plugin :( I cannot check it off

[negative]	[07:34]	<scguy318>	spiderskull: any alternate driver mention?
[negative]	[07:34]	<scguy318>	spiderskull: if so you'll have to blacklist it

[negative]	[07:34]	<spiderskull>	no can do on the pasting, I've gotta type it all (since the machine in question has no internet)
[neutral]	[07:34]	<odzk>	can anyone pls help me how to restore the panel on my desktop? i accidentally closed it

[neutral]	[07:35]	<spiderskull>	scguy318 -- ndiswrapper -l shows only the drivers I've installed.. as per the wiki, I blacklisted acm42xx, since it said it's been known to cause problems

[negative]	[07:38]	<ademan>	if i had a text only install, and i apt-get installed ubuntu-desktop, would that be equivalent to me installing the base system from the liveCD probably?
[neutral]	[07:38]	<scguy318>	joanki: no, it is downloading deb(s) from repositories, then installing them
[neutral]	[07:38]	<joanki>	what is a resposittory

[negative]	[07:38]	<fit4lfe>	ok so I screwed up the env variables in ubuntu feisty with python seems I deleted the path to pygtk for the update-manager does anyone know how i can change this ?
[negative]	[07:38]	<joanki>	ok but it says e: couldn't find package irssi
[neutral]	[07:38]	<tritium>	joanki: so to speak, yes
[neutral]	[07:38]	<ademan>	scguy318: what would be different?

[negative]	[07:39]	<tritium>	joanki: it's in main.  If you can't find it, you've not updated your package list
[negative]	[07:39]	<scguy318>	spiderskull: yeah, you should have it mentioned in /etc/modprobe
[neutral]	[07:39]	<riotkittie>	joanki: try sudo apt-get update
[negative]	[07:39]	<ademan>	scguy318: doesn't ubuntu-desktop depend on the entire base system?

[positive]	[07:41]	<tovella>	joanki: do you use yahoo, or aim instant messaging, as well?
[neutral]	[07:41]	<scguy318>	spiderskull: and modprobe -l just lists all the modules
[negative]	[07:41]	<bone>	Is there any way to validate if my do-release-upgrade was completely successful?
[negative]	[07:41]	<odzk>	I've detected a panel already running,

[negative]	[07:42]	<Jaggs>	ok I am new and wondering... if wireless shows as an option at all in my networks does that mean it is recognising my card?
[positive]	[07:42]	<scguy318>	spiderskull: System -> Administration -> System Log may be helpful
[negative]	[07:42]	<bluebanana>	is it because gutsy doesn't know that I have a video card that can do that?
[negative]	[07:42]	<spiderskull>	scguy318: yeah, my mistake.. lsmod does show it, though

[positive]	[07:43]	<scguy318>	Smergzor: thats exactly it, when it finishes indexing it shouldn't suck up CPU
[negative]	[07:43]	<odzk>	riotkittie: this is what i get ie> odzk: ok, then right click on your top panel, select new panel

[neutral]	[07:43]	<kc>	greetings all
[negative]	[07:44]	<riotkittie>	Ashfire908: no. if you need to defrag NTFS, youre better off doing it in windows
[negative]	[07:44]	<odzk>	my window got messed up sorry
[negative]	[07:44]	<spiderskull>	hehe... I used to do that pasting thing when I first started; it's the whole right-click thing; if you're not used to it being associated with paste, it happens

[negative]	[07:44]	<kc>	does anyone know why the firefox add-on tab effect wont work with ubuntu??
[negative]	[07:44]	<riotkittie>	odzk: right click on the top panel in an empty space, select new panel.
[negative]	[07:45]	<Ashfire908>	riotkittie, windows takes hours and then doesn't defrag all of it
[neutral]	[07:45]	<jotil>	odzk, right click on your top panel and select - add panel
[neutral]	[07:45]	<odzk>	what is that?
[neutral]	[07:45]	<IlanG>	Hi all. Is this the right place to get help with 7.10?

[negative]	[07:45]	<Smegzor>	I finally fixed up my shared folders.  I had to re-add my password to samba after upgrading to 7.10.  Somehow it lost the password.
[neutral]	[07:45]	<tritium>	IlanG: yes, it is
[neutral]	[07:45]	<jotil>	odzk, join gnome help channel
[neutral]	[07:45]	<sorsis>	odzk: UBCD = Ultimate Boot CD

[negative]	[07:46]	<odzk>	why do i need the boot cd?
[negative]	[07:46]	<riotkittie>	Ashfire908: if windows takes hours to defrag, chances are you're waiting way too long between defrags.

[negative]	[07:47]	<spiderskull>	I mean, I'm more or less saavy, and it took me a while, but I'd like to get involved in making it easier
[negative]	[07:47]	<riotkittie>	odzk: right click on the bottom panel > add to panel.  you'll find everything you need in the window that pops up, and you can just drag it to the panel
[negative]	[07:47]	<Ashfire908>	riotkittie, so i'm supposed to defrag each week or something?
[negative]	[07:47]	<trax_>	I ssem to have trouble with starting games. I get an error about framebuffers, but I can't seem to any info on how to install them, and seting vga= via grub hasn't worked either.
[neutral]	[07:47]	<odzk>	ok i got it now, thanks for the help

[negative]	[07:47]	<extrakick>	i got dual screens and had to do alot of research to edit the xorg file on 7.04, will i need to do the same to get it working on 7.10?
[neutral]	[07:48]	<Smegzor>	Is there a nicer tool than top for viewing running processes?
[neutral]	[07:48]	<IcemanV9>	Smegzor: htop

[positive]	[08:11]	<Jordan_U>	scguy318, You forgot the mount :)
[negative]	[08:11]	<IlanG>	IcemanV9: I'm installing it now. (the fglrxinfo). let's see what it'll say
[negative]	[08:11]	<alromaithi>	guys with gutsy ubuntu  , i downloaded kde desktop and im using it , but i cant use the kde 4,0 themes with compiz , because emerald comes instead , when removing emerald i dont see a title bar

[negative]	[08:11]	<riotkittie>	im downloading the torrent and about to do a clean install, myself. seven mins left, wooohoo. then again, its late and i'm feeling lazy.
[negative]	[08:12]	<riotkittie>	i'm going to be so mad if gutsy continues to refuse to install to my external. grr.
[positive]	[08:12]	<jotil>	ckw__: i used it with feisty but never used mythtv. it works with v4l
[negative]	[08:12]	<IcemanV9>	IlanG: ah. so fglrx was not installed then. ok. let me know if it works or not (aticonfig)
[negative]	[08:12]	<racarter>	ok.. question 1.. how do i automount the ntfs drive now?

[neutral]	[08:12]	<Cyber_Stalker>	!latest
[negative]	[08:12]	<racarter>	actually that's like question 30 for me by now...
[positive]	[08:12]	<ubotu>	"Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. ""Works for me"" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability."

[neutral]	[08:13]	<alromaithi>	Cyber_Stalker: 7.10 gutsy
[negative]	[08:13]	<IlanG>	IcemanV9: Yep. 4 lines
[neutral]	[08:13]	<racarter>	i did run ntfs-config earlier
[negative]	[08:13]	<IcemanV9>	IlanG: then aticonfig should be working
[negative]	[08:13]	<IlanG>	IcemanV9: what do you want to know from those 4 lines?
[positive]	[08:13]	<ckw__>	jotil:try installing mythtv and see if the card is recognized when you run the backend...that will be the true test
[negative]	[08:13]	<racarter>	i will paste the contents of fstab in a minute...
[neutral]	[08:13]	<alromaithi>	Jordan_U: can you help me plz , i did a fresh install of gutsy guys with gutsy ubuntu  , i downloaded kde desktop and im using it , but i cant use the kde 4,0 themes with compiz , because emerald comes instead , when removing emerald i dont see a title bar

[negative]	[08:13]	<IlanG>	IcemanV9: oh... i'll try
[negative]	[08:13]	<darkzero>	guess not
[negative]	[08:14]	<alromaithi>	Jordan_U: problem is i want to see the icon in the system tray where i used to right click and change themes from theyr lke in feisty
[neutral]	[08:14]	<racarter>	also ls /media/windows/Documents\ and\ Settings\
[negative]	[08:14]	<racarter>	does not show any files in the folder
[neutral]	[08:14]	<racarter>	which should not be true...
[negative]	[08:14]	<racarter>	i hope its not true
[neutral]	[08:14]	<Extravert>	hello
[negative]	[08:15]	<Jaggs>	is there someone in here willing to help me figure out why my wireless is not functioning?
[neutral]	[08:15]	<Extravert>	does anyone know how to upgrade by iso or cd?
[neutral]	[08:15]	<jotil>	ckw__, running the test with xawtv. don't you think mythtv should support v4l?
[negative]	[08:15]	<crazytime>	"anyone have any ideas about the 7.10 alt cd install saying ""the CD_ROM does not seem to contain a valid 'Release' file""?"
[neutral]	[08:15]	<racarter>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[08:15]	<racarter>	is the contents of /etc/fstab
[negative]	[08:15]	<K_Dallas>	Hi guys! A quick question: If I install ubuntu, would it be hard to add Xfce and when added, would it be much different than Xubuntu? Thanks
[negative]	[08:15]	<racarter>	is it wrong?
[negative]	[08:16]	<Flannel>	crazytime: You're trying to do the CDrom upgrade?
[neutral]	[08:16]	<ckw__>	jotil:I believe it does...i have seen many references to v4l in the myth config screens
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Flannel>	K_Dallas: It'll be the same (install the xubuntu-desktop pacakage)
[negative]	[08:16]	<scguy318>	racarter: nope
[negative]	[08:16]	<crazytime>	Flannel: no a clean install
[negative]	[08:16]	<Extravert>	Flannel:  you know how to do the upgrade by cd or iso?
[positive]	[08:16]	<K_Dallas>	Flannel, thank you very much.
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Flannel>	Extravert: You can upgrade with the alternate CD, yes.
[neutral]	[08:16]	<scguy318>	racarter: it must have been the fact that the NTFS partition was not cleanly dismounted as the reason why it didn't mount the first time
[negative]	[08:16]	<IcemanV9>	Jaggs: can u elaborate more on your wireless? what kind? is it turned on? is it up and running?
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Extravert>	Flannel: I have th eregular
[neutral]	[08:16]	<Flannel>	crazytime: Try checking the CD for defects (at the boot menu)
[negative]	[08:17]	<IlanG>	"IcemanV9: I don't have the file ""xorg.conf"". does it means i need to install something ?"
[negative]	[08:17]	<racarter>	the thing is that i am pretty sure i could not access /media/sda1 right after reboot
[negative]	[08:17]	<racarter>	or i could access but nothing there
[negative]	[08:17]	<scguy318>	racarter: yeah that was probably why
[negative]	[08:17]	<racarter>	which is why i was trying to manually mount it
[negative]	[08:17]	<Flannel>	Extravert: desktop CD can't be used to upgrade, only install (although you can always reinstall around your home partition)
[neutral]	[08:17]	<IntuitiveNipple>	crazytime: Possibly... see @HLINK
[negative]	[08:17]	<IlanG>	IcemanV9: opps. my mistake. I do have it
[negative]	[08:17]	<IcemanV9>	IlanG: what? how did you install ubuntu?
[negative]	[08:17]	<freetos>	does anybody know how i can install all the required shit to compile everything and anything, ie.. sudo apt-get install ....?
[neutral]	[08:17]	<racarter>	i am confused
[positive]	[08:17]	<IcemanV9>	IlanG: nm. you found it. :)
[neutral]	[08:17]	<IlanG>	I upgraded it from 7.04
[neutral]	[08:18]	<Flannel>	freetos: build-essential, and please watch the language
[neutral]	[08:18]	<WaltzingAlong>	freetos: build-essential
[neutral]	[08:18]	<CoasterMaster>	!info build-essential | freetos
[neutral]	[08:18]	<Jaggs>	IcemanV9: I have a HP Pavilion dv6000, with a broadcom wireless card built in... I believe I have everything for that... ut its not picking anything up at all
[neutral]	[08:18]	<ubotu>	freetos: build-essential: informational list of build-essential packages. In component main, is optional. Version 11.3ubuntu1 (gutsy), package size 6 kB, installed size 48 kB
[positive]	[08:18]	<freetos>	Flannel: thanks
[neutral]	[08:18]	<crazytime>	IntuitiveNipple:  okay thanks i will check the link
[negative]	[08:18]	<racarter>	does anyone think there is something wrong with my /dev/sda1 partition?
[neutral]	[08:18]	<IntuitiveNipple>	freetos: To get you started: sudo apt-get install build-essential gettext autoconf automake
[negative]	[08:18]	<jotil>	ckw__, heh. the card is working. i guess MythTV is pretty much the best software out there?
[negative]	[08:18]	<racarter>	maybe that's why windows won't boot anymore?
[negative]	[08:18]	<nemik>	so any way to make gnome's calendar/time start on mondays and not sundays?
[positive]	[08:18]	<hotshot23t>	So i used the upgrade process and it got to the point where it opened restricted driver for the broadcom43xx. It goes on to say that the driver is open source but the firmware is not. So I let it do it's thing and internet is working fine (which is an amazing feat in itself with this card.) So anyway my question is, what driver am i using? Open source driver or the ndsiwrapper driver that I had working from firesty
[negative]	[08:18]	<IcemanV9>	Jaggs: ah. broadcom. you'll need nisdiswrapper (sp?).
[neutral]	[08:19]	<scguy318>	hotshot23t: open source driver using closed-source firmware
[positive]	[08:19]	<tritium>	nemik: I believe that's affected by locales settings
[neutral]	[08:19]	<scguy318>	hotshot23t: bcm43xx I think?
[negative]	[08:19]	<nemik>	tritium: so how to change?
[negative]	[08:19]	<Flannel>	nemik: If its not a locale setting, you might try perusing gconf
[neutral]	[08:19]	<scguy318>	IcemanV9: ndiswraper
[neutral]	[08:19]	<scguy318>	*ndiswrapper
[positive]	[08:19]	<ckw__>	jotil:AFAIK that is true...it works here flawlessly with a Hauppauge PVR-350
[negative]	[08:19]	<Jaggs>	ndiswrapper... got it, it now shows wireless as an option but... no connections available at all
[neutral]	[08:20]	<anya123>	hi
[negative]	[08:20]	<racarter>	hmm.. i guess i should restart to see if i can read anything from /media/sda1 right?
[negative]	[08:20]	<IlanG>	"IcemanV9: I run ""sudo  aticonfig --initial --input=/etc/X11/xorg.con"" and at the and it says: ""Aborted (core dumped)"
[negative]	[08:20]	<tritium>	nemik: perhaps sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales, but I'm not positive
[neutral]	[08:20]	<hotshot23t>	scguy318: now i've heard that it only runs at 11 mbps vs the 54 using the ndiswrapper method
[neutral]	[08:20]	<anya123>	this irssi is really archaic looking
[positive]	[08:20]	<tritium>	nemik: also, check your System -> Administration -> Language Support
[positive]	[08:20]	<nemik>	anya123: it is the best
[negative]	[08:20]	<scguy318>	hotshot23t: not at all
[negative]	[08:20]	<rohan_>	how do i check which version of ubuntu am i running ? because unlike other distros ubuntu has no file in etc, like ubuntu_version or so
[negative]	[08:20]	<Flannel>	anya123: Not really, its just not frilly
[neutral]	[08:20]	<Flannel>	rohan_: lsb_release -a
[neutral]	[08:20]	<anya123>	why, nemil?
[neutral]	[08:20]	<nemik>	tritium: thanks i'll see
[negative]	[08:20]	<anya123>	it's impossible to use
[neutral]	[08:20]	<racarter>	rohan_ uname ?
[negative]	[08:20]	<arooni_>	folks, i can't upgrade to 7.10, everytime i do upgrade from feisty it says it cant get a package or two and the upgrade aborts...ideas?
[negative]	[08:21]	<hotshot23t>	does it have to do with wine
[neutral]	[08:21]	<tritium>	racarter: lsb_release -a would be best
[neutral]	[08:21]	<scguy318>	arooni_: try downloading the alternative CD and upgrading use that
[positive]	[08:21]	<nemik>	anya123: it is great, srsly.
[negative]	[08:21]	<anya123>	how can i get it to show who'shere
[neutral]	[08:21]	<nemik>	anya123: /names
[neutral]	[08:21]	<anya123>	this is like .... cmd prompt business
[negative]	[08:21]	<racarter>	where do they get the code names from?
[negative]	[08:21]	<nrp>	No #ubuntu+1 yet?  There appear to be new packages in Hardy
[positive]	[08:21]	<scguy318>	anya123: that's the nature of a command-line IRC client :P
[neutral]	[08:22]	<Flannel>	racarter: @HLINK
[negative]	[08:22]	<tritium>	anya123: there's a plugin you can load to show a list of nicks
[negative]	[08:22]	<zNOOPy>	"i have big problems to get my ubuntu to start on my sony 40"" lcd, anyone got a solution for me ?"
[negative]	[08:22]	<hotshot23t>	arooni_: did it tell you it failed to fetch a
[neutral]	[08:22]	<IcemanV9>	IlanG: just type sudo aticonfig --initial; sudo aticonfig --overlay-type=Xv
[neutral]	[08:22]	<tritium>	anya123: it's in the irssi-scripts package
[neutral]	[08:22]	<anya123>	cani make it more usesrfriendly?
[negative]	[08:22]	<scguy318>	zNNOOPy: what problem exactly
[neutral]	[08:22]	<IcemanV9>	IlanG: then restart the X (ctrl alt backspace)
[negative]	[08:22]	<anya123>	i like xchat but i don't want to pay the fee - im in school
[negative]	[08:22]	<Flannel>	anya123: What isn't friendly about it?
[neutral]	[08:22]	<Flannel>	anya123: xchat is free
[positive]	[08:22]	<nemik>	the command-line is the best user interface ever
[neutral]	[08:22]	<anya123>	it is?
[positive]	[08:22]	<jlebrech>	anyone know how to install an xfi xtreme audio soundcard? it has an audigy chip, but the vendor strings say xfi.
[positive]	[08:22]	<tritium>	anya123: sure, and it's available in ubuntu
[negative]	[08:22]	<IlanG>	IcemanV9: ok. i'll try
[positive]	[08:22]	<Flannel>	anya123: Of course, its in main.
[neutral]	[08:22]	<bryce_>	hi everyone, i'm having some issues upgrading from 7.04 to 7.10 using the update manager - getting a gzip sub process generated an error code. anyone help with this?
[neutral]	[08:23]	<IcemanV9>	anya123: everything is free on ubuntu
[neutral]	[08:23]	<nemik>	ssh+screen+irssi = best chat experience
[negative]	[08:23]	<anya123>	if i stop using irsssi, do i need to uninstall it?  or is it dif from windows like that?
[positive]	[08:23]	<bmt2>	hello to all
[negative]	[08:23]	<ckw__>	IcemanV9:You seem to be hip to the ati fglrx driver...I am trying to extend to the second monitor with an ATI AIW 9600....is this possible with this card and this driver?
[neutral]	[08:23]	<bmt2>	i have a question in regards to audacity
[negative]	[08:23]	<Flannel>	anya123: It'll take up harddrive space, but that's it.
[negative]	[08:23]	<scguy318>	anya123: you dont have to, you can remove it if you want
[negative]	[08:23]	<extrakick>	i persoally thing it would be better to do fresh install of 7.10
[positive]	[08:23]	<zNOOPy>	"scguy318, it works great on my samsung 22"" monitor... but when i plug in the hdmi for my 40"" the screen goes black after grub countdown"
[neutral]	[08:23]	<Madpilot>	Flannel, neither xchat nor xchat-gnome are in Main, actually. Both Universe.
[neutral]	[08:23]	<extrakick>	that is wat im planning on doing
[negative]	[08:23]	<anya123>	remove it from the library?  or remove it from my computer?
[negative]	[08:23]	<bmt2>	i just tried to DNB mix that I found in mpeg format to mp3
[negative]	[08:23]	<scguy318>	zNOOPy: hmm, not sure
[negative]	[08:23]	<[chr0n0s]>	"ok, does this makes any sense.. i installed the ati drivers for xorg 7.1, then xserver started, i goto restricted manager and checked  ""ATi Acclerated Graphics Driver"" my question is which driver i am using finally?"
[positive]	[08:23]	<anya123>	a bit confused about it all still
[negative]	[08:23]	<extrakick>	but then again im new to linux, others might say otherwise
[negative]	[08:24]	<Flannel>	Madpilot: xchat-gnome got demoted?  Geez, whats with canonical and the crusade against usable IRC clients?
[neutral]	[08:24]	<jlilly>	anyone found a fix to the problem where dual displays are effectively one giant screen? (gnome-panels span both screens as do maximized windows) Using nvidia 7600 GS, Gutsy Ask if you need more info.
[negative]	[08:24]	<Madpilot>	anya123, just ignore it. irssi doesn't take up a lot of space.
[neutral]	[08:24]	<bmt2>	Audacity is looking for libmp3lame.so.0 which is located in /usr/lib
[negative]	[08:24]	<bmt2>	but for some reason Audacity doesn't sit it
[negative]	[08:24]	<Madpilot>	Flannel, sod if I know.
[neutral]	[08:24]	<lwizardl>	hi
[neutral]	[08:24]	<IcemanV9>	ckw__: never try dual monitor with ati driver before ... someone here will give you answers
[neutral]	[08:24]	<Flannel>	Madpilot: @HLINK  its in main
[negative]	[08:24]	<bmt2>	"could the file be ""hidden"" if so, how do I change tha t?"
[neutral]	[08:24]	<bmt2>	tha t?
[negative]	[08:24]	<racarter>	yeah the code names still dont make sense after reading that
[negative]	[08:24]	<Madpilot>	Flannel, ah, so it is. thought it had been demoted too.
[neutral]	[08:24]	<anya123>	oops
[negative]	[08:24]	<jlilly>	Flannel: have you tried dual monitors with nvidia?
[neutral]	[08:24]	<racarter>	what happened to gaim?
[neutral]	[08:24]	<ckw__>	IcemanV9:10-4...thanks
[negative]	[08:24]	<anya123>	how do i get out of irssi and back to cmd promt?
[negative]	[08:24]	<Flannel>	Madpilot: Wouldn't put it past them
[neutral]	[08:24]	<Flannel>	anya123: /quit
[negative]	[08:24]	<anya123>	i want xchat
[neutral]	[08:24]	<nemik>	anya123: /quit
[neutral]	[08:24]	<dga>	racarter: gaim is now pidgin

[neutral]	[08:25]	<Flannel>	jlilly: No
[negative]	[08:25]	<racarter>	why the rename? gaim sounded more reasonable
[neutral]	[08:25]	<bryce_>	anyone here that can help out with a Gutsy Gibbon upgrade problem?
[negative]	[08:25]	<MikeVail>	ok i'll say it, i've become too lazy to add taxonomy tags. is there anyway to auto generate them?
[neutral]	[08:25]	<Flannel>	racarter: issues with AOL
[positive]	[08:25]	<Jordan_U>	Flannel, Madpilot It's xchat that is in universe
[negative]	[08:25]	<lwizardl>	i have 3 directories in my trash that I can't delete how can i force remove them
[neutral]	[08:25]	<IcemanV9>	ckw__: it is doable though; i have seen others mention that it worked
[neutral]	[08:25]	<racarter>	bastards
[negative]	[08:25]	<Madpilot>	racarter, AOL was probably muttering
[positive]	[08:25]	<jlilly>	bryce_: just ask your question and get ignored like the rest of us ;)
[positive]	[08:25]	<jube>	gutsy installed. pidgin takes a LONG time to connect to irc............  on feisty, it was almost instant
[neutral]	[08:25]	<jotil>	ckw__, last question: mythubuntu is what you installed? for the backend and frontend of mythtv?
[negative]	[08:25]	<bryce_>	jlilly, seems that way :(
[neutral]	[08:26]	<racarter>	i am going to restart soon even though i know it wont do anything..
[neutral]	[08:26]	<racarter>	is there anyway to check an ntfs partition for problems?

[negative]	[09:18]	<MrEgg964>	Hi all, me again. I upgraded to Gutsy, and ran into a few issues. I did a aptitude safe-ugrade, things have been fixed. I'm not sure my new Gutsy version is the full one though, as for instance I now have a Gnome logo instead of the Ubuntu logo next to the Applications menu. I like the Gnome logo, mind you - but is this a hint somehow that my Gutsy upgrade isn't total?
[positive]	[09:18]	<wasabi_>	rothchild, compiz fusion has this option. gusty has it built in

[positive]	[09:20]	<wasabi_>	rothchild, perhaps you should install the compiz tray icon. it has the option to use metacity
[negative]	[09:20]	<MrEgg964>	wasabi_: the thing is, I have video issues if I boot directly from the 7.10 cd - which is apparently why my upgrade was stopped in the middle of the process.

[negative]	[09:22]	<jacquesmerde>	zyxnull: i'm sure its a bug. i mean, lots of people install without a net connection, and if they do the lose the easy restricted drivers codecs enabling. coz they have to magically know about sources
[negative]	[09:22]	<gkwong>	jordan: i installed a security update, is that a package?

[positive]	[09:25]	<Jordan_U>	gkwong, Yes, you will need to reinstall them whenever there is a kernel upgrade
[neutral]	[09:25]	<dga>	zyxnull: does your system lock up when you suspend or hibernate?

[negative]	[09:26]	<xipietotec>	I upgraded to gutsy, on a dell Inspiron E1505N (that came preinstalled with linux), and I seem to have lost my wireless.
[neutral]	[09:26]	<racarter>	should it the ntfs partition be mounted?
[negative]	[09:26]	<MrEgg964>	wasabi_: I just did that, and it went through; if that's all there is to it, then I guess I'm done and ready to go. I just find it kind of strange I don't have my Ubuntu logo, I don't have my Fast User Change and Desktop Search by default...
[positive]	[09:26]	<xipietotec>	it also seems to have changed drivers in restricted driver manager?
[positive]	[09:27]	<dary1>	anyone know how to get suspend/resume working for wireless cards?
[negative]	[09:27]	<ndan>	dan yea... i just did that with a few apps....
[positive]	[09:27]	<Jordan_U>	gkwong, Not that long of a discrepancy usually but yes, Linux isn't optimized for fast boots as much as windows ( though you don't need to boot nearly as much :)
[negative]	[09:27]	<DanMulvey>	ndan: thanks, wanted to make sure before i get started!
[neutral]	[09:27]	<gkwong>	Jordan, haha, ok. Thanks!
[negative]	[09:27]	<Dyus>	DanMulvey: i think if u check off only download packages in synaptic u can move em where u like once their downloaded
[neutral]	[09:27]	<wasabi_>	MrEgg964, you have to add the those to the task bar
[positive]	[09:28]	<ndan>	mine was still formated as fat32 too, and that didn't hurt nething (tho i wasn't executing them FROM the travel drive, i copied to hd first)
[negative]	[09:28]	<wasabi_>	MrEgg964, if you're missing the ubuntu logo, then you can just reinstall it
[negative]	[09:28]	<Jordan_U>	DanMulvey, You can use synaptic to make a package download script
[negative]	[09:28]	<wasabi_>	MrEgg964, are you referring to the splash? cause that has been disabled
[negative]	[09:29]	<racarter>	how do i find out what processes are using a file?
[negative]	[09:29]	<DanMulvey>	jordan_u: actually, i need to download them in windows and then transfer them to my ubuntu machine because it has no net connection
[neutral]	[09:29]	<Jordan_U>	racarter, lsof | grep /path/to/file
[negative]	[09:29]	<MrEgg964>	wasabi_: yeah, sure, I can fix those small issues manually; what I'm wondering though is, is this a hint my Gutsy isn't completely installed?

[negative]	[09:30]	<zyxnull>	dga: You're right, there seems to be a problem with suspend
[neutral]	[09:30]	<crshman>	PriitM, i have issues with CPU usage
[negative]	[09:31]	<crshman>	i have no idea why, i think it has to do with my kernel though

[negative]	[09:31]	<zyxnull>	dga: Well, at least this driver is a LOT better than its successors
[positive]	[09:31]	<dmandell>	I need a little bit of help with the Compiz Application switcher, the Bring to Front pref isn't working.  Can anyone help?
[negative]	[09:32]	<MrEgg964>	wasabi_: That would make sense, too. Now, what about my third party repos? They were all set to point to feisty. They've been disabled prior to the upgrade. Am I just supposed to manually replace feisty by gutsy and re-enable them, or is there a little more than that to it?

[negative]	[10:10]	<xipietotec>	anolis_, well, in feisty, hitting fn+f2 turned it on, now after upgrading to gutsy, that is an unknown key combination according to dmesg
[negative]	[10:10]	<anolis_>	xipietotec what does fn+f2 do

[negative]	[10:11]	<k6rfm>	DanMulvey, sorry gotta hit the sack; but the plan should to be seeing if basic networking (w/o security) works; then try adding crypto layers on; if later stuff doesn't work either you've put the keys in wrong or the router or ubuntu has a bug...
[negative]	[10:11]	<xipietotec>	anolis_, iwconfig, and ifconfig give me nothing.

[neutral]	[10:29]	<DanMulvey>	i would have never known about that iwconfig, thanks a lot
[neutral]	[10:29]	<codecaine>	get the orginal respiratory from ubuntuforumns website or ur live cd and replace it
[negative]	[10:29]	<allobjects[2]>	codecaine, do you mean switch which server repositories come from ?
[negative]	[10:30]	<kaminix>	Chaos88: Tried Swiftfox? It's like Firefox but modified to increase performance.
[positive]	[10:30]	<jxxt>	chandler_, same for me only it was xp that evaporated
[neutral]	[10:30]	<Anolys>	chandler_, there is a grub installer on the 7.10 cd (from what i hear) that may help you recover your windows boot ability
[negative]	[10:30]	<Chaos88>	kaminix no, should I?
[neutral]	[10:30]	<chandler_>	so download the .iso?
[positive]	[10:30]	<codecaine>	disabling ipv6 helps with network speed

[negative]	[10:32]	<kaminix>	Chaos88: @HLINK Don't know any other solutions.
[positive]	[10:32]	<jxxt>	chandler_, Use a live cd to see if you can find the ntfs partion

[negative]	[10:50]	<dox>	Jessicatz: It's just frustrating because every time I've let Ubuntu do an upgrade to the latest dist (usually only one version higher) it always hoses my system
[negative]	[10:50]	<Jessicatz>	LordLimecat: I don't know that, but it surely would not upgrade until there is a newer version in the ubuntu-repos, so it doesnt brake anything
[negative]	[10:50]	<codecaine>	shaffox when you type in your wepkey did you do it like 11111122222233333344444455 or 0x01 etc

[neutral]	[11:25]	<denis`da>	Can I activate the desktop effects without restarting my system on a live CD after installing some restricted drivers (ATI)?
[neutral]	[11:25]	<spnz>	synaptics?
[neutral]	[11:26]	<cwillu>	spnz: in synaptic
[neutral]	[11:26]	<cwillu>	spnz: settings | repositories
[neutral]	[11:26]	<dromer>	chowmeined: nope, one of the major problems is my /home and another partition can't get mounted
[neutral]	[11:26]	<spnz>	k
[neutral]	[11:26]	<dromer>	chowmeined: @HLINK
[neutral]	[11:26]	<cwillu>	denis`da: if it needed a new driver, not really
[negative]	[11:26]	<Tigerman>	cwillu, is it possible to insert the 'DMI BIOS year' on my mobo?
[negative]	[11:26]	<cousin_luigi>	is it possible to have the trashcan on the desktop?
[neutral]	[11:26]	<cousin_luigi>	(gnome)
[negative]	[11:26]	<cwillu>	denis`da: you can just restart x, but that gonna close everything
[negative]	[11:26]	<cwillu>	Tigerman: no idea, sorry
[positive]	[11:26]	<gabbarinho>	sorry, lavender, getting a bit overwhelmed by the deluge of text :)
[positive]	[11:27]	<cwillu>	:p
[neutral]	[11:27]	<fyrestrtr>	cousin_luigi, yes
[neutral]	[11:27]	<cousin_luigi>	fyrestrtr: how?
[neutral]	[11:27]	<fyrestrtr>	cousin_luigi, run gconf-editor
[negative]	[11:27]	<denis`da>	cwillu:  yeah I restarted X but I can't activate the desktop effects.
[negative]	[11:27]	<janerik>	cwillu: I will try to do tha, will come back if I do not get it right. Thank you sooooo much... I also have another problem with my wireless after upgradin. It shows all the awaylible networks, but not the signal strenght. And when I try to connect to my router the computer hangs
[negative]	[11:27]	<Tigerman>	cwillu, how can i disable the tooltips i get when hovering over an item in my Window List   ?
[positive]	[11:27]	<fyrestrtr>	cousin_luigi, it is one of the options for nautilus.
[neutral]	[11:27]	<chowmeined>	dromer: can you pastebin the output of 'mount /home'
[positive]	[11:27]	<cwillu>	denis`da: it may not work on the live cd if you need to install stuff, not sure
[negative]	[11:27]	<denis`da>	yeah seems so
[neutral]	[11:27]	<dromer>	chowmeined: mount: /dev/hda5 already mounted or /home busy
[neutral]	[11:28]	<dromer>	and it's most definetly not mounted
[positive]	[11:28]	<murlidhar>	what is the command to install qt libs
[neutral]	[11:28]	<cwillu>	dromer: you have evms and friends installed
[positive]	[11:28]	<cousin_luigi>	fyrestrtr: thanks!
[neutral]	[11:28]	<murlidhar>	!Qtlibs
[negative]	[11:28]	<remus>	cybbah: does the audio work when you login as root? if so... you probably need the right priviliges to access audio devices
[negative]	[11:28]	<ubotu>	Sorry, I don't know anything about qtlibs - try searching on @HLINK
[neutral]	[11:28]	<mcscruff>	anyone good with spreadsheets?
[neutral]	[11:28]	<joerack>	Has ati driver 8.42 arrived yet?
[negative]	[11:28]	<dromer>	cwillu: don't know
[neutral]	[11:28]	<cwillu>	dromer: uninstall evms, dmsetup, dmraid, and mdadm (presuming you're not using a raid)
[neutral]	[11:28]	<murlidhar>	!info QT libs
[neutral]	[11:28]	<ubotu>	Package qt does not exist in gutsy
[neutral]	[11:28]	<fyrestrtr>	mcscruff, my accountant
[neutral]	[11:28]	<fyrestrtr>	!info libqt
[neutral]	[11:28]	<ubotu>	Package libqt does not exist in gutsy
[negative]	[11:28]	<Tigerman>	guys, where in gconf-editor can i disable the tooltips i get when hovering over an item in my Window List   ?
[negative]	[11:28]	<dromer>	cwillu: ok, I've already tried purging mdadm (not using raid), and that didn't work, what are the other packages?
[negative]	[11:29]	<cwillu>	dromer: run udevmonitor and tell me if you get a bunch of add/removes happening continuously
[negative]	[11:29]	<nesoi>	control-alt-backspace is dangerous... it should warn you before just killing your login session
[negative]	[11:29]	<joerack>	Any news of 8.42 ati guys?
[negative]	[11:29]	<dromer>	cwillu: not any events that I can see
[neutral]	[11:29]	<cwillu>	dromer: evms, dmraid, mdadm
[negative]	[11:29]	<ksivaji>	is it possible to cheat ISP and use more bandwidth in wired net connection
[neutral]	[11:29]	<cwillu>	dmsetup
[negative]	[11:29]	<murlidhar>	so i can't install qt libs????
[neutral]	[11:29]	<janerik>	cwillu: I have the xserver-xorg-vide-intell installed....
[negative]	[11:29]	<dromer>	cwillu: how can I best remove them? apt-get remove --purge?
[negative]	[11:29]	<gabbarinho>	hmm
[neutral]	[11:29]	<cwillu>	ksivaji: um, illegal stuff, we don't want to hear about
[negative]	[11:29]	<Terrasque>	nesoi: ctrl-alt-backspace kills the X server instantly. If you dont want that, dont use it
[negative]	[11:30]	<gabbarinho>	lavender, this seems to be a way to check the iso and not the CD
[negative]	[11:30]	<cwillu>	janerik: okay, then just change xorg.conf
[negative]	[11:30]	<cwillu>	dromer: I'd just do it from synaptic
[positive]	[11:30]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: its an escape method
[negative]	[11:30]	<cwillu>	dromer: but just a plain apt-get remove would work
[negative]	[11:30]	<dromer>	ok
[negative]	[11:30]	<gharz>	mechdave: in my /etc/network/interfaces  there's no eth1... eth1 is my wireless network.
[neutral]	[11:30]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: if it warns you.. and your mouse doesnt move...
[negative]	[11:30]	<gabbarinho>	if the iso is corrupt, then I would assume burning it at 1x speed woudl not make a difference
[neutral]	[11:30]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: correct
[positive]	[11:30]	<cwillu>	dromer: purge just removes config settings as well, which won't break anything, but also won't help anything
[neutral]	[11:30]	<squeeme>	anyone knows how to disable XGL?
[neutral]	[11:30]	<Arafangion>	nesoi: It is used ONLY in the event of a serious crash
[positive]	[11:30]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: you verified it against the MD5SUM?
[neutral]	[11:30]	<nesoi>	Terrasque: killing your session and losing all your data with any keystroke with no warning is not User Friendly
[positive]	[11:30]	<janerik>	cwillu: I'm just 4 months user of ubuntu:-) can you tell me how to... Thank you very much so long:-)
[negative]	[11:30]	<gabbarinho>	i am not sure what that means, chow
[positive]	[11:30]	<cwillu>	janerik: :p
[neutral]	[11:31]	<nesoi>	ie: not ready for users who don't know what they're doing, which is part of the point of unbuntu, I thought
[neutral]	[11:31]	<dromer>	cwillu: only evms evms-ncurses are being removed
[neutral]	[11:31]	<ksivaji>	cwillu will you hangon to 128kb/s
[neutral]	[11:31]	<Arafangion>	nesoi: How the hell does one *accidentially* simulataniously press three buttons that are physically separated from each other?
[neutral]	[11:31]	<gabbarinho>	i am struggling a bit to make sense of the instructions
[positive]	[11:31]	<dromer>	cwillu: mdadm was already gone :)
[negative]	[11:31]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: ok
[neutral]	[11:31]	<cwillu>	"janerik: gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, look for Driver ""i810"", change i810 to intel, and restart x"
[neutral]	[11:31]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: you ran the check cd for defects?
[neutral]	[11:31]	<cwillu>	dromer: evms will do it
[negative]	[11:31]	<gabbarinho>	yep
[negative]	[11:31]	<gabbarinho>	i don't thinkt here is a problem with it
[negative]	[11:31]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: did it pass?
[negative]	[11:31]	<cwillu>	dromer: it grabs the devices so you can't mount them
[neutral]	[11:31]	<gabbarinho>	yes, it did
[positive]	[11:31]	<janerik>	cwillu: thank you so much.
[positive]	[11:31]	<dromer>	cwillu: ok, well, hope it works :)
[neutral]	[11:32]	<sudoer>	does ubuntu 7.10 come with 2.6.23?
[positive]	[11:32]	<cwillu>	janerik: thank me when it works :p
[neutral]	[11:32]	<mechdave>	gharz: just one second, just uploading changes to your file...
[negative]	[11:32]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: then it isnt corrupt
[neutral]	[11:32]	<dromer>	cwillu: updateing initramfs ...
[neutral]	[11:32]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: what is happening?
[neutral]	[11:32]	<gharz>	mechdave: alrighty,..
[negative]	[11:32]	<cwillu>	sudoer: don't believe so, although you can run a 2.6.23 kernel if you compile it (modulo issues with restricted kernel modules)
[neutral]	[11:32]	<gabbarinho>	well, I select installation, and things begin to load
[negative]	[11:32]	<AmsiNZ>	Tigerman: Try adding  acpi=force into the boot options for ubuntu in your /boot/grub/menu.lst like grub was suggesting at boot.
[positive]	[11:32]	<gabbarinho>	the bar starts moving
[negative]	[11:32]	<cwillu>	dromer: you might need to restart as well, not sure if you can rmmod the appropriate things live
[negative]	[11:32]	<gabbarinho>	then about 20 seconds later, it hangs
[negative]	[11:32]	<dromer>	cwillu: ok, reboot?
[negative]	[11:32]	<gabbarinho>	that's it
[negative]	[11:32]	<cwillu>	dromer: yep
[positive]	[11:32]	<dromer>	cwillu: I will :)
[neutral]	[11:32]	<cwillu>	well
[neutral]	[11:32]	<dromer>	brb
[neutral]	[11:32]	<cwillu>	dromer: you could try it first
[negative]	[11:33]	<nesoi>	Arafangion: control-backspace deletes a word... control and alt are next to each other (on my keyboard) ... is it that big a stretch to think that someone will accidentally hit both control and alt when they mean to hit alt, and then touch backspace?
[negative]	[11:33]	<nesoi>	I don't think so.
[negative]	[11:33]	<cwillu>	but otherwise, reboot
[positive]	[11:33]	<cwillu>	nesoi: I've done that :p
[neutral]	[11:33]	<mechdave>	sku: did that fix your problems?
[positive]	[11:33]	<racarter>	can anyone recommend a powerful graphical text editor
[neutral]	[11:33]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: ctrl+alt+backspace has been around a long time though....
[neutral]	[11:33]	<chowmeined>	racarter: gvim
[positive]	[11:33]	<nesoi>	cwillu: thanks.
[negative]	[11:33]	<cwillu>	nesoi: there's an option to disable it in xorg.conf, which I thought they made the default (are you running an upgrade or fresh install)
[neutral]	[11:33]	<dystopianray>	racarter: kate
[neutral]	[11:33]	<dromer>	cwillu: try what?
[neutral]	[11:33]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: legacy doesn't imply goodness
[neutral]	[11:33]	<cwillu>	dromer: mounting
[neutral]	[11:33]	<racarter>	besides vi or emacs
[negative]	[11:33]	<nesoi>	chowmeined: that's nice, but if ubuntu is supposed to be a general replacement for consumer desktops, having that keystroke in it is Bad
[neutral]	[11:33]	<chowmeined>	cwillu: but its useful...
[neutral]	[11:33]	<mechdave>	gharz: try this --> @HLINK
[positive]	[11:34]	<dystopianray>	racarter: kate is awesome
[neutral]	[11:34]	<cwillu>	racarter: _especially_ vi and emacs
[negative]	[11:34]	<gabbarinho>	wow, all this time I didn't know that control+delete deletes a word
[negative]	[11:34]	<gharz>	mechdave: ok.
[neutral]	[11:34]	<nesoi>	cwillu: upgrade from the beta version of gutsy
[neutral]	[11:34]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: so is dynamite.
[negative]	[11:34]	<_blitz_>	how do i tell whether my bluetooth dongle is detected?
[neutral]	[11:34]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: well... id rather have it.. when buggy gui apps decide to lock everything up
[neutral]	[11:34]	<dromer>	cwillu: again I get: mount: /dev/hda5 already mounted or /home/ busy
[negative]	[11:34]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: there's a reason the power button doesn't do a hard power off anymore
[positive]	[11:34]	<LuCypher>	 /msg ubotu mirrors
[neutral]	[11:34]	<cwillu>	dromer: k, reboot then
[neutral]	[11:34]	<nesoi>	chowmeined: if it can be enabled specifically by those who want it, fine. if it's a default, Bad
[neutral]	[11:34]	<racarter>	ok also i dont really like the command line in gnome.. is there any alternatives
[neutral]	[11:34]	<mechdave>	_blitz_: try hcitool in a terminal
[positive]	[11:34]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: fine
[negative]	[11:34]	<dromer>	cwillu: ok, bbl
[negative]	[11:35]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: there's another keystroke to disable grabs, and ctrl+alt+f1 should be just as effective without actually killing stuff
[positive]	[11:35]	<Mikkel^>	Hello all... i needed Help :)
[negative]	[11:35]	<cybbah>	i have an acer 5720 with an intel audio device but my audio don't work with gutsy ... can you help me plssss
[positive]	[11:35]	<Mikkel^>	Will LinuX installering Dont working for MS Virtual PC 2007?
[negative]	[11:35]	<gabbarinho>	do you have any idea what's going on with my installation, chow?
[negative]	[11:35]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: guess we should disable alt+sysctrl then...
[negative]	[11:35]	<_blitz_>	ok.lsusb produced a positive result.wil that be enough?
[neutral]	[11:35]	<sudoer>	if i have fedora 7 installed and i want to upgrade to ubuntu 7.10 can i do it without lose data in simple way?
[neutral]	[11:35]	<mechdave>	gharz: then restart your network --> /etc/init.d/networking restart
[negative]	[11:35]	<chowmeined>	gabbarinho: im sorry, i haven't run into that.. im not sure
[positive]	[11:35]	<racarter>	i liked the xubuntu command line
[negative]	[11:35]	<nesoi>	chowmeined: what does that do?
[negative]	[11:35]	<gharz>	mechdave: ok.
[negative]	[11:35]	<cwillu>	racarter: look up 'term' in synaptic, there's at least a dozen
[neutral]	[11:35]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: does special debug stuff by directly interfacing with the kernel
[negative]	[11:35]	<cwillu>	sudoer: back up your home directory, and any other directories that might have stuff you need
[negative]	[11:36]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: for example.. alt+sysctrl+b instantly reboots your computer (unsafe shutdown)
[negative]	[11:36]	<nesoi>	chowmeined: yep, that should be enabled only when wanted, by developers and the like
[positive]	[11:36]	<Tigerman>	guys, where in gconf-editor can i disable the tooltips i get when hovering the mouse pointer over an item in the Window List   ?
[negative]	[11:36]	<cwillu>	racarter: you can install it, I'm just not sure what its called
[neutral]	[11:36]	<gebruiker>	hoiii
[neutral]	[11:36]	<nesoi>	chowmeined: just think about your grandmother using it... she hits the wrong keys and bang... all her work is gone
[negative]	[11:36]	<dystopianray>	chowmeined: sysctrl = print-screen/sysrq ?
[neutral]	[11:36]	<gebruiker>	hello
[negative]	[11:36]	<gebruiker>	how are you?
[neutral]	[11:36]	<chowmeined>	dystopianray: sysrq is what i meant
[neutral]	[11:37]	<chowmeined>	apologies
[negative]	[11:37]	<jxxt>	sudoer, I would burn my data to disk first then do a clean install but I am no expert as you can tell by my response
[negative]	[11:37]	<cwillu>	nesoi: not to argue against the point, but do you really think your grandmother is gonna be using three key keyboard shortcuts?
[positive]	[11:37]	<cwillu>	nesoi: mine has trouble with 'shift' :p
[negative]	[11:37]	<_blitz_>	i tried to install openobex but failed.i can give you the config.log file.can somebody please help me with it?
[neutral]	[11:37]	<chowmeined>	its enough trouble getting them to right click...
[negative]	[11:37]	<nesoi>	cwillu: no, but she could hit some random keys by mistake or when trying to do something else
[negative]	[11:38]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: I have more trouble getting people to left click for some reason
[negative]	[11:38]	<Tigerman>	i have disabled the global panel tooltips, but they don't seem to disable the Window List and other tooltips, like Show Desktop Button tooltips and stuff...
[neutral]	[11:38]	<Tigerman>	please help
[negative]	[11:38]	<cybbah>	Guys my audio don't work i had follow the wikies but don't work :( can you help me ... my audio device is an intel hda in a laptop acer 5720
[negative]	[11:38]	<mechdave>	_blitz_: What are you trying to achieve with bluetooth?
[neutral]	[11:38]	<racarter>	does anyone use opera?
[negative]	[11:38]	<nesoi>	the point is, crashing and losing your work potentially by mistake is Bad if it's really a consumer desktop
[neutral]	[11:38]	<remus>	racarter yes
[negative]	[11:38]	<aEv>	"Hi, the ""screens and graphics"" manager thingie doesnt seem to want to start. Anyone know the appname so i can see the error messages?"
[neutral]	[11:38]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: windows should disable blue screens
[neutral]	[11:38]	<_blitz_>	connect to internet with my nokia phone
[neutral]	[11:38]	<mechdave>	chowmeined: lol
[negative]	[11:38]	<racarter>	yes you use it or yes you think there is someone in the world actually using it
[negative]	[11:38]	<Arafangion>	_blitz_: That's nothing.
[negative]	[11:39]	<nesoi>	chowmeined: blue screens are a fatal error, obviously not the same thing at all
[neutral]	[11:39]	<dystopianray>	nesoi: you inadvertantly pressed ctrl+alt+backspace?
[negative]	[11:39]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: except, you can design a system that never crashes
[negative]	[11:39]	<spnz>	okei.. ran into another problem..Compiler version check failed. g++ 3.4 or later is needed
[neutral]	[11:39]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: not the fatal kernel error kind at least
[negative]	[11:39]	<_blitz_>	why its nothing? i am a newbie.its something for me
[negative]	[11:39]	<spnz>	how to get newer version ?;/
[negative]	[11:39]	<chowmeined>	nesoi: so why not just do it?
[negative]	[11:39]	<nesoi>	dystopianray: no, I did it as part of instructions for getting the front and back mouse buttons to work... it didn't say it was going to lose my session
[neutral]	[11:39]	<mechdave>	_blitz_: right first make sure your dongle works.. open a terminal and type sudo hcitool
[neutral]	[11:39]	<cwillu>	dystopianray: I've done it
[negative]	[11:39]	<Arafangion>	nesoi: I never realised that ctrl+backspace deletes a word.  Must be a windows-ism.
[negative]	[11:39]	<_blitz_>	ok
[neutral]	[11:40]	<pipatron>	Arafangion: it is
[positive]	[11:40]	<_blitz_>	now i am in xp
[neutral]	[11:40]	<chowmeined>	dw deletes a word
[negative]	[11:40]	<nesoi>	I suppose all my processes are children of x, so they go away if x reboots, but I didn't think of that
[neutral]	[11:40]	<chowmeined>	see.. dw == delete word
[positive]	[11:40]	<chowmeined>	that makes sense
[negative]	[11:40]	<nesoi>	and neither would grandma
[neutral]	[11:40]	<_blitz_>	but when i was in ubuntu a lsusb produced a positive result
[neutral]	[11:40]	<pipatron>	ctrl+w in insert
[positive]	[11:40]	<nanonyme>	combinio, dw as in ^W?
[neutral]	[11:40]	<mechdave>	_blitz_: can you access the internet from ubuntu?
[negative]	[11:40]	<MaDiNfO_>	hi does anyone knows why after upgrading to 7.10 ./configures cant find anything on include ?
[positive]	[11:40]	<dystopianray>	nanonyme: dw is a vi command
[neutral]	[11:40]	<_blitz_>	no
[negative]	[11:40]	<racarter>	is there any graphical utility in linux to do text compare?
[positive]	[11:40]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: because the arrow keys are obviously misleading :p
[neutral]	[11:40]	<nanonyme>	ahm
[negative]	[11:40]	<chowmeined>	cwillu: i like hjkl better...
[negative]	[11:40]	<cwillu>	racarter: I use vbindiff, but it's terminal mode
[positive]	[11:41]	<racarter>	na i am looking for graphical..
[negative]	[11:41]	<spnz>	actually it wrote: CXX env variable is not set, attempting to use g++
[neutral]	[11:41]	<chowmeined>	MaDiNfO_: install build-essential?
[positive]	[11:41]	<MartinW>	I uninstalled evolution. If I install the desktop-base package will I be able to upgrade?
[neutral]	[11:41]	<cwillu>	racarter: ignore what I said, I misread
[positive]	[11:41]	<combinio>	nanonyme: ummm... what ? :)
[negative]	[11:41]	<spnz>	so as far as I understand, i need to set CXX
[negative]	[11:41]	<nanonyme>	combinio, i had no idea what dw was
[negative]	[11:41]	<racarter>	"i want some ""lightweight"" all purpose graphical text editor actually"
[negative]	[11:41]	<spnz>	which doesn't ring a bell to me ;/
[negative]	[11:41]	<cwillu>	racarter: search synaptic for something with diff and gnome in the name
[neutral]	[11:41]	<cwillu>	racarter: gdiff might be something, taking a stab in the dark
[negative]	[11:42]	<mechdave>	_blitz_: Ok this is how you basically do it... make sure your dongle works, make sure you can connect to your phone as dial up networking
[neutral]	[11:42]	<chowmeined>	here we go
[positive]	[11:42]	<combinio>	nanonyme: and what DW is ? :] i've never asked about this 'dw' :P
[neutral]	[11:42]	<MaDiNfO_>	showmeined: its instaled

[neutral]	[11:44]	<xjkx>	it says 7.04 is supported until 2008, if i keep doing apt-get upgrade until then, it will keep me on 7.04 right? just dist-upgrade will take me to gutsy ?

[neutral]	[11:44]	<cwillu>	xjkx: dist-upgrade isn't what it sounds like;  only update-manager will upgrade to gutsy; dist-upgrade wont
[negative]	[11:44]	<dromer>	only problem now is thunderbird gave an error :S
[neutral]	[11:45]	<jxxt>	xjkx, no
[positive]	[11:45]	<janerik>	cwillu: any Idea what it can be??? It worked great before upgrading:-(
[neutral]	[11:45]	<mechdave>	spnz: try apt-get install build-essential

[neutral]	[11:45]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: dist-upgrade?
[positive]	[11:45]	<xjkx>	anyway, apt-get upgrade won't take me to gutsy, right? this is the most important at all
[neutral]	[11:45]	<chowmeined>	cwillu: yes
[positive]	[11:45]	<lavender_dream>	Cochise: To see whether it's a Firefox issue or your networking issue in Ubuntu, I'd check out Firefox preferences, Edit > Advanced > Network tab, and settings.
[negative]	[11:45]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: dist-upgrade is just a smart package install, it doesn't actually change the repositories
[neutral]	[11:45]	<aEv>	"Is anyone familiar with a malfunctioning 'screens and graphics' ? It doesnt want to start. Running ""displayconfig-gtk"" directly also gives interesting errors."
[neutral]	[11:46]	<aEv>	after gutsy upgrade

[negative]	[11:46]	<Turgon>	Hello. I have been trying to make a PRO-NETS DM100A digital TV receiver work on Ubuntu 7.10 in my notebook, without success. I don't know which module (if there is one that would work) should I load nor which parameters should I use. The card' specifications can be found at @HLINK , and my lspci output at @HLINK . Thanks for you time and work.
[neutral]	[11:46]	<cwillu>	xjkx: yes
[positive]	[11:46]	<chowmeined>	cwillu: right.. but if you change the sources.list then do dist-upgrade.. it works like normal yes?
[positive]	[11:46]	<jxxt>	xjkx, apt-get update then when that finish do apt-get dist-upgrade and you will stay with feisty until you wish to change
[neutral]	[11:46]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: well, kinda
[positive]	[11:46]	<chowmeined>	cwillu: excellent
[negative]	[11:46]	<Cochise>	lavender_dream: i tried enabling ipv6 in firefox and it didnt help, when i type ethtool eth0 it says unknown interface
[neutral]	[11:46]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: the usual manual approach is to change the sources.list, dist-upgrade, then dpkg-reconfigure -all -phigh, and then dist-upgrade again, and then dpkg-reconfigure again, until dist-upgrade doesn't do anything anymore
[negative]	[11:46]	<nox-Hand>	Anyone tell me what the nm-applet line in System -> Preferences -> Session -> Startup Programs is? I lost it. It's a quick find, anyone?
[neutral]	[11:46]	<Cochise>	lavender_dream: irc through pidgin wont work either so its a network issue id say
[positive]	[11:47]	<xjkx>	uhmm, so everybody is agreeing that just update-manager gets me to gutsy ;) i'm feeling safer now :) what is it, apt-get update-manager or just update-manager ?
[negative]	[11:47]	<cwillu>	chowmeined: the upgrade tool consists of workarounds for all the things that don't upgrade properly unless you do it in a particular fashion, or with the method I outlined
[negative]	[11:47]	<chowmeined>	cwillu: ok
[neutral]	[11:47]	<cwillu>	xjkx: yes
[positive]	[11:47]	<janerik>	cwillu: you think that will help? is the 7.1 so different? And how will i do that?:-)
[neutral]	[11:47]	<IntuitiveNipple>	"nox-Hand: ""nm-applet --sm-disable"""
[neutral]	[11:47]	<posingaspopular>	xjkx: you should install via the commandline, most people seemto have sucess with that
[negative]	[11:47]	<cwillu>	xjkx: apt-get won't ever upgrade to gutsy unless you change /etc/apt/sources.list by hand
[negative]	[11:47]	<lavender_dream>	Cochise: oh doh, I'm sorry to  hear that, perhaps someone more knowledgable than me can help you with networking issue, I'm using a direct connection so it's hard for me to say myself having only used Ubuntu for about a month.

[negative]	[12:15]	<remix5x>	im trying to search for something on the ubuntu forums, how do i make it search for ALL keywords and not just some?
[negative]	[12:15]	<cwillu>	abhibera: I'd strongly suggest finding a good local supplier;  it's hard to beat local service;  I'd expect you can get a good machine for 5-800, and an lcd for another 150-200

[positive]	[12:18]	<cwillu>	abhibera: on the other hand, the requirements for really good 3d desktop is about the same as respectable games performance
[neutral]	[12:18]	<pipatron>	kondor101: What info
[negative]	[12:18]	<abhibera>	cwillu: ah.... but definitely not looking for integrated. i want a discrete graphics adapter

[negative]	[12:18]	<abhibera>	cwillu: not quite. the desktop just displays simple rectangles. there aren't too many triangles to be bothered about like a game
[negative]	[12:19]	<kondor101>	pipatron, i used to use 7.04  in 7.04 if i connected my PSP it came up just like an ipod,  now it just isn't seeing it on 7.10
[neutral]	[12:19]	<cwillu>	abhibera: the desktop does alot of heavy texture processing

[neutral]	[12:19]	<pipatron>	It's definately fast enough
[positive]	[12:19]	<abhibera>	cwillu: yea but games do a lot more than that. :)
[neutral]	[12:19]	<abelabel>	zhankx: could you expand on that?
[neutral]	[12:19]	<[chr0n0s]>	nosrednaekim, @HLINK
[negative]	[12:19]	<shosholoza>	zhanx, i will tried it with the gutsy cd, if it doesn't work, do you have an idea, what can i do than
[negative]	[12:19]	<pipatron>	Trying to play GTA3 in even the lowest resolution - doesn't work.
[neutral]	[12:19]	<kondor101>	anyone got a psp handy and 7.10 ?
[negative]	[12:19]	<cwillu>	abelabel: slow down, I wasn't even halfway through writing a resopnse
[neutral]	[12:20]	<abelabel>	(sorry for posting twice)
[neutral]	[12:20]	<zhanx>	abelabel, system - admin - software sources - download from
[negative]	[12:20]	<cwillu>	abelabel: remove the entry about dapper
[negative]	[12:20]	<regebro>	OK, so the upgrade failed when installing the packages. The result: Ubuntu thinks it's 7.10, but I'm nore sure it really is. What do I do now?
[neutral]	[12:20]	<zhanx>	shosholoza, reformat - backup first
[neutral]	[12:20]	<cwillu>	abhibera: depends on the game, but none the less, the texture mapping is something that is noticable better on better cards
[neutral]	[12:21]	<remix5x>	It would be so awesome and would draw SO MANY people to linux if ubuntu could come preinstalled with wine and imports the windows registry from windows and allow you to use all pre-exisitng windows applications straight from the windows partition!

[positive]	[12:21]	<shosholoza>	zhanx, thank you
[negative]	[12:21]	<abhibera>	cwillu: yea... the antialiasing is better on a discrete graphics card. u don't see jaggies
[negative]	[12:21]	<remix5x>	I know its possible, and i'm quite frankly surprised that anyone hasn't though about it or done a readme on how to do it yet
[negative]	[12:21]	<abhibera>	cwillu: but it's not so bad on a integrated card
[positive]	[12:21]	<kadakas>	dystopianray: it worked! thx :)
[negative]	[12:21]	<gorski>	pidgin: msn problem in Gutsy - waiting for network connection.
[negative]	[12:21]	<cwillu>	abhibera: that's not a function of the integration, it's a function of the chipset
[negative]	[12:22]	<regebro>	I've looked for some help on how to restart the upgrade or at least make sure that it actually worked, even though it sais it failed, but nothing....

[neutral]	[12:22]	<abhibera>	a
[positive]	[12:22]	<nosrednaekim>	remix5x: but do we want that? a free replacement for windows? shouldn;t people switch to linux on its own rights? Off topic too ;)
[negative]	[12:22]	<Joel_vx>	whats the difference between 'apt-get' and 'aptitude' VS synamptic? for example, command line utils dont show up under synaptic, but i can install them via apt-get... I thought they all use the same repositories?
[negative]	[12:22]	<kondor101>	no help at all? this is strange, usually your such helpful guys
[negative]	[12:22]	<zhanx>	remix5x, that would mean i have to have a windows install
[neutral]	[12:22]	<Blou_Aap_>	any one know why terminal window goes all white when desk effects are enabled ?
[positive]	[12:22]	<cwillu>	Joel_vx: synaptic shows the same packages;  applications add/remove uses a different list though

[negative]	[12:23]	<Joel_vx>	cwillu: got vmware server working allright, had to use 32bit libs though, im thinking maybe i made a mistake to go with amd64 arch...
[neutral]	[12:23]	<cwillu>	kondor101: does udevmonitor show anything when you plug it in?
[positive]	[12:24]	<janerik>	Hello, after thinking alot ... Before upgrading my ubuntu was feisty, now its Gutsy... Can that be my problem???? Beginner:-)
[neutral]	[12:24]	<Tigerman>	hello
[negative]	[12:24]	<cwillu>	Joel_vx: ya, unless you need the 64bit support/performance, 32 bit is way easier to work with
[negative]	[12:24]	<Joel_vx>	cwillu: just built a new system so i wanted to make full use of it, hence running 64 bit
[neutral]	[12:24]	<Blou_Aap_>	help ?

[positive]	[12:25]	<cwillu>	janerik: check if the gutsy live cd works fine re: acceleration
[negative]	[12:25]	<Tigerman>	zhanx, I DON'T?
[negative]	[12:25]	<mechdave>	Tigerman: You can't log in as root, you have to use sudo
[negative]	[12:25]	<zhanx>	!root > Tigerman
[negative]	[12:25]	<regebro>	Come on people! there must be a way to tell ubuntu to retry the upgrade?
[negative]	[12:25]	<dystopianray>	Tigerman: you need to set a password if you want to login as root
[negative]	[12:25]	<remus>	Tigerman you cannot login as root by a default install of ubuntu
[neutral]	[12:25]	<kondor101>	well, i am guessing udevmonitor is a terminal prog yes?

[positive]	[12:26]	<nosrednaekim>	cwillu: if h already started the upgrade it does
[negative]	[12:26]	<ubotu>	Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth.. there is no root password. Then you will see that it is sudo that grants you access and not the root password. Look at @HLINK
[positive]	[12:26]	<dystopianray>	Joel_vx: and how much of that 1.2GB was disk cache?

[neutral]	[12:26]	<dystopianray>	Joel_vx: more disk cache is better
[positive]	[12:26]	<janerik>	cwillu: I can do that, but all my emails, docs and so on I will have to save and put it in again.... Many ours of work:-) so if I can fix it without fresh install will be the best

[neutral]	[12:31]	<dystopianray>	kjalil: does your access point support static dhcp leases? that is the easiest way
[negative]	[12:31]	<Shadow_Fi>	any clue?
[negative]	[12:31]	<kondor101>	cwillu, no problems on 7.04
[negative]	[12:31]	<pipatron>	remix5x: Go ahead
[neutral]	[12:31]	<elliotjhug>	cwillu: fair enough - I'll take a look.
[neutral]	[12:31]	<Tigerman>	what is acpi?
[neutral]	[12:31]	<zhanx>	kjalil, you manually configure?
[neutral]	[12:31]	<zilchy>	"Running Gutsy, my sound works (ALSA) on the desktop but when I try to use Mixxx using the ALSA API it tells me that the ""Audio device could not be opened"".  Works in OSS, but I need multiple channels so I can use the cue output.  Any tips?"
[neutral]	[12:31]	<dystopianray>	remix5x: because it's unlikely to work
[negative]	[12:31]	<voraz>	does anybody know how to install 7.10 i downloaded the iso file and ive got poweriso, what now?
[negative]	[12:31]	<Jo3>	dystopianray, ok well, when i type that I get : Cannot execute binary file
[negative]	[12:31]	<cwillu>	kondor101: I'd try it under a gutsy live cd, just to rule out any issues with the actual install
[negative]	[12:31]	<elliotjhug>	janerik: OK, I assume you are using desktop effects if we're talking direct rendering. What's your graphics card?
[negative]	[12:31]	<FreeFull>	What should I know before upgrading to Gutsy?
[negative]	[12:31]	<Shadow_Fi>	i try connect using wlan, wep 64 hex, and give the passcode (10 digits), it is trying to connect, after few minutes asks passcode again, and again...
[negative]	[12:31]	<remix5x>	pipatron, i can't I don't posess the technical knowledge
[negative]	[12:31]	<dystopianray>	voraz: burn it and boot it
[negative]	[12:31]	<zilchy>	voraz, burn the ISO to a disc and boot
[negative]	[12:31]	<nosrednaekim>	voraz: did you burn the iso?
[neutral]	[12:32]	<voraz>	just copy the iso file on a cd?
[positive]	[12:32]	<nosrednaekim>	FreeFull: you have the right to remain silent ;)
[negative]	[12:32]	<zilchy>	be sure not to burn the ISO as a data file
[positive]	[12:32]	<zilchy>	:-P
[negative]	[12:32]	<Pickle_Weasel>	hmm, is it still possible to update from 5.10? I am trying to follow the update page, but failing horribly.
[negative]	[12:32]	<voraz>	oh :(
[negative]	[12:32]	<Ubuntu-newb>	voraz: You have to burn it as an Image-CD and then you change your bootsequence to include CD as 1st Boot Device... then you can boot from CD
[negative]	[12:32]	<kondor101>	cwillu, i think i can see whats happening, 2 secs

[positive]	[12:32]	<remus>	remix5x because linux is about freedom and wiindowz is about DRM
[negative]	[12:32]	<Tigerman>	what is acpi? and why does is my motherboard telling me i need to force acpi in able to enable it?
[negative]	[12:32]	<remix5x>	dystopianray, It most certainly is.... I ran warcraft 3 on ubuntu from my existing windows partition simply by writing the registry keys into wine registry
[negative]	[12:32]	<kjalil>	zhanx: i did that, in System/Administration/Network and then disabled roaming and then set a static IP with WPA key, etc and it doesn't work
[negative]	[12:32]	<cwillu>	Pickle_Weasel: you'll have to upgrade to 6.06, and then 6.10, and then 7.04, and then 7.10, in turn
[positive]	[12:32]	<janerik>	elliotjhug: No desktop effects..... My graphicscard???:-) Hp compac laptop:-)
[neutral]	[12:32]	<Extravert>	hello my sound isnt working.  I dont think my sound card is detected
[negative]	[12:32]	<cwillu>	Pickle_Weasel: the 6.06 upgrade will probably be the worst of the bunch
[neutral]	[12:32]	<dystopianray>	remix5x: it is unlikely to work for much else
[negative]	[12:33]	<Pickle_Weasel>	"cwillu: that is that i am attempting to do, 6.06 atm, but i keep getting the message ""your version is no longer supported"""
[negative]	[12:33]	<elliotjhug>	janerik: OK, well whats the graphics card in it. It might be Intel, Nvidia or ATI?
[negative]	[12:33]	<remix5x>	remus: I know, but ubuntu is trying to appeal to windows users and the average joe... and the average joe wants at least some windows programs to run in linux... thats what most windows users try to do after trying linux

[neutral]	[12:33]	<zilchy>	Tigerman, yes. use sudo
[negative]	[12:33]	<elliotjhug>	cwillu: OK. Odd that direct rendering would have an effect without using desktop effects..
[negative]	[12:33]	<remix5x>	dystopianray, wine has a large database of windows programs that work with it... anything that works with wine should work... all you need are the registry keys
[negative]	[12:33]	<Shadow_Fi>	i try connect using wlan, wep 64 hex, and give the passcode (10 digits), it is trying to connect, after few minutes asks passcode again, and again... like the passcode would be wrong, but its not...
[positive]	[12:33]	<lonnie>	thank you both, will try ASAP
[negative]	[12:33]	<kjalil>	zhanx: umm, no idea
[neutral]	[12:33]	<zhanx>	Shadow_Fi,  manually configure it and try all the options with wep type
[negative]	[12:33]	<cwillu>	elliotjhug: hmm, I thought his issue was mostly desktop effect related;
[neutral]	[12:34]	<Tigerman>	ok thanks
[negative]	[12:34]	<IdleOne>	lonnie: if there is packages to upgrade it will if it does not upgrade any packages then you are already at final release

[negative]	[12:34]	<Shadow_Fi>	dont know, didnt try to turn WEP off
[neutral]	[12:34]	<zilchy>	Joikast, enable the restricted driver repository in synaptic and try again.

[negative]	[12:35]	<Shadow_Fi>	can i just search all availeble networks in area, like in Windows?
[neutral]	[12:35]	<cwillu>	Pickle_Weasel: if you can't, then you can still just change all the references to warty to dapper in /etc/sources.list, and the apt-get dist-upgrade, and the dpkg-reconfigure -all -phigh, and keep doing both of those until it seems done
[negative]	[12:35]	<oling>	nosrednaekim: you mean the closed source (restricted) ATI driver?

[neutral]	[12:41]	<dystopianray>	folkert: did you install the nvidia binary driver?
[positive]	[12:41]	<zilchy>	stitchlin: yeah, my kernel got screwed when I upgraded, went and did a fresh install after that (since the install was only a week old)
[positive]	[12:41]	<compwiz18>	wimdows, *sigh* I was hoping that wouldn't be the answer ;)
[neutral]	[12:41]	<folkert>	No, swap uses 182 mb
[neutral]	[12:41]	<Extravert>	Lustblader: seems installed
[positive]	[12:41]	<IdleOne>	techknow: already in the repos for your installing enjoyment :)
[neutral]	[12:41]	<folkert>	Yes I installed the NVIDIA driver
[neutral]	[12:41]	<Lustblader>	Extravert: go to add/remove programs > gtstreamer plugins
[neutral]	[12:42]	<techknow>	IdleOne: I found a solution on lifehacker
[neutral]	[12:42]	<wimdows>	compwiz18, did a Google search turn up anything?
[negative]	[12:42]	<Joikast1>	wimwdows: and then?
[neutral]	[12:42]	<jxxt>	"Extravert, also gstreamer plugins they are in ""add remove"" on you desktop"
[neutral]	[12:42]	<stitchlin>	im tring to not todo that Zilchy
[neutral]	[12:42]	<IdleOne>	techknow: whatever works for you
[neutral]	[12:42]	<JimQode>	compwiz18, does turning off compiz help?
[negative]	[12:42]	<shnastybiznastic>	I hate to take up everyone's time with this, but is there any way to disable the screens and graphics application?  I'm trying to recreate the functionality of my old xorg.conf from Fiesty and that application adding in another layer of mess isn't helping.
[negative]	[12:42]	<stitchlin>	i have 3 failed packs
[positive]	[12:42]	<zhanx>	Shadow_Fi,  sent one
[negative]	[12:42]	<zilchy>	Anyone have any idea how to make Mixxx recognize ALSA devices?  It works in OSS but with only 2 channels and I need at least 3.
[positive]	[12:42]	<techknow>	IdleOne: thanks ;)
[positive]	[12:42]	<janerik>	elliotjhug: I have a cpu monitor on the tray. It shows almost full all the time. So something is having fun with the cpu:-)
[negative]	[12:42]	<compwiz18>	wimdows, nope, nothing on here or ubuntuforums either
[neutral]	[12:42]	<oling>	after i removed xserver-xgl compiz is not working anymore
[negative]	[12:42]	<elliotjhug>	janerik: OK, thats great. Next time I ask you to run a command like that make sure you include the whole thing though. The | grep direct bit would have let me get the answer I needed in a single line. Give me a moment.
[negative]	[12:42]	<folkert>	Should I install gstreaner pitffd
[negative]	[12:42]	<folkert>	or something

[negative]	[12:43]	<mechdave>	Cochise: Maybe something I am missing... Go System --> Administration --> Network and see if eth0 is all up and running there. Ie: not on roaming mode and configured with dhcp
[positive]	[12:43]	<Jo3>	dystopianray, ok worked perfect, thanks
[neutral]	[12:43]	<oling>	zilchy: my mix recognizes alsa

[neutral]	[12:46]	<Cochise>	mechdave: cheers, its a new probelm thats happened with gutsy, loads on the forums have the same probelm a lanchpad bug was filled ircc
[neutral]	[12:46]	<wimdows>	compwiz18, I'm stumped
[neutral]	[12:47]	<Lustblader>	Extravert: not a software issue

[negative]	[12:47]	<mechdave>	Cochise: No worries, sorry I couldn't solve it for you :(
[positive]	[12:47]	<zilchy>	oling, based on what it says in terminal when I run mixxx and try to select an alsa device, it's a portaudio issue. (just saw that now. :-P)
[neutral]	[12:47]	<zhanx>	askand, can you afford it?
[negative]	[12:47]	<Cochise>	mechdave: thanx for trying
[neutral]	[12:47]	<mefiXe>	why isnt compiz working, my card is fast enough!
[negative]	[12:47]	<IntuitiveNipple>	alien18: note - when configuring with ./configure the default location for installation is set to /usr/local/bin. If you want your built apps to be installed to the standard location on the system use ./configure prefix=/usr
[neutral]	[12:47]	<JimQode>	askand, it depends both on your laptop and the type of rams you have
[neutral]	[12:47]	<Lustblader>	Extravert: try searching various devices manually in sound prefs
[negative]	[12:47]	<jxxt>	mefiXe, there might be but I doubt that they are fully functional
[neutral]	[12:48]	<JimQode>	mefiXe, maybe you need a restricted driver?
[negative]	[12:48]	<wimdows>	compwiz18, aye - it's a pain, but it will likely sort it; just very annoying not to figure out what the cause was...
[negative]	[12:48]	<mefiXe>	i've got the restricted driver running

[neutral]	[12:48]	<compwiz18>	and pidgin
[neutral]	[12:48]	<Extravert>	Lustblader: whats command to reconfigure x11?

[neutral]	[12:49]	<elliotjhug>	janerik: you need to run lspci in a console
[neutral]	[12:49]	<mechdave>	Cochise: Is the little box next to wired ethernet ticked (eth0)?

[positive]	[12:49]	<IntuitiveNipple>	compwiz18: I didn't see your original problem, but following the development updates shouldn't be an issue. I've done that since June
[negative]	[12:49]	<Lustblader>	Extravert: that's stuff too dangerous for me to give advice bout
[negative]	[12:49]	<elliotjhug>	janerik: a terminal I mean

[negative]	[12:49]	<JimQode>	mefiXe, it should run fine with radeon 9600. at least on 7.10
[neutral]	[12:49]	<mefiXe>	hmkay
[positive]	[12:49]	<elliotjhug>	mefiXe: its a bit of a risk and is never recommended.

[neutral]	[12:49]	<mechdave>	Cochise: Should work...
[negative]	[12:49]	<compwiz18>	IntuitiveNipple, it's quite possible there is another source for this bug, but I'm stumped so that's what's next up on the agenda

The weird part is that all other program accept input fine, just not the one that stopped working

I don't think this is overheating (if the temp monitors are still visible when this happens they are no higher than usual), how can i fix this?

[positive]	[13:40]	<garu>	tatters ur spelling is right :)
[positive]	[13:40]	<ny00123>	yokomo, the right mount entry can be added to /etc/fstab

[negative]	[13:45]	<void^>	Tigerman: by default acpi is disabled for pre-2000 implementations, because those were extremely buggy most of the time. it seems your bios fails to specify the implementation year correctly, so you need to use acpi=force. just add it to your menu.lst and be happy.

[negative]	[14:27]	<mechdave>	Jaymac: give it a go, should work with that, a way to check is to call sudo mount -a from a terminal
[negative]	[14:28]	<Jaymac>	ok
[positive]	[14:28]	<Jaymac>	back in a while
[neutral]	[14:28]	<kristofer>	FluxTendu, dual monitor can be setup using System->Administration->Screens and Graphics
[negative]	[14:28]	<saloxin>	Siropel: ubuntu has no such restrictions afaik
[negative]	[14:28]	<edaniel>	bjb1959 - got me, that was a guess
[negative]	[14:28]	<FluxTendu>	kristofer i use that one...
[negative]	[14:28]	<bjb1959>	I have a minor issue. I have set power management in the gui to off and shut off screensaver but my monitor still shuts down after 30 minutes. any idea which file I need to change to stop that from happening?
[positive]	[14:28]	<kristofer>	FluxTendu, it works well for me, only I can't get my custom resolution.. are you using an intel chip?
[negative]	[14:28]	<DMole>	murlidhar: more likely that you had a bad path or rtorrent has to little permissions ; both are fixable.
[neutral]	[14:28]	<shnastybiznastic>	DaMi3n, ah.  that's a small step on the road to success
[negative]	[14:28]	<kristofer>	FluxTendu, if so, you need to use the i810 driver
[neutral]	[14:28]	<FluxTendu>	nop nvidia
[neutral]	[14:29]	<saloxin>	bjb1959: check bios settings?
[positive]	[14:29]	<DaMi3n>	:)
[neutral]	[14:29]	<addicted68098>	hi, I was booting ubuntu 7.10 from the live cd and I got several IO read error things, I have used early versions of ubuntu with success, is it the CD thats the problem?
[negative]	[14:29]	<kristofer>	XGL is really really slow on my intel 915GM (using the intel driver). any ideas about making faster?
[negative]	[14:29]	<NullNone>	What i have to do to play Matroska video files in Ubuntu 7.10?
[negative]	[14:29]	<defishguy>	Hello all.  Does anyone have any suggestions for s2ram in Gutsy?  My understanding is that s2ram has been built in to acpi-config in some way.  s2ram is no longer executable from cli and isn't a part of the repo uswsusp package.  I'm trying to fix suspending on an Acer laptop.
[neutral]	[14:29]	<mechdave>	Cochise: have a look at this --> @HLINK
[positive]	[14:29]	<bjb1959>	saloxin, only happens in gutsy, opensuse works fine on same machine

[neutral]	[14:29]	<NTAuthority>	addicted68098: if it's an error from the cd/dvd drive, it's probably the cd

[positive]	[14:30]	<defishguy>	@kristofer:  Turn off as many of the animated (read: wobbly windows) plugins that you can and that will help.

[neutral]	[14:31]	<addicted68098>	torrent: @HLINK
[negative]	[14:31]	<poe>	saloxin: maybe i'll just stick to windows ... and i thought the partitioning would solve this problem (i used wubi for 7.04)

[neutral]	[14:32]	<kristofer>	FluxTendu, @HLINK
[positive]	[14:32]	<umop>	tarchy, you are very witty
[negative]	[14:32]	<shnastybiznastic>	DaMi3n, I hate to bug out on you like this, but it's about bedtime for me and my software headache.  If you kep having issues, double check tha your apache and php packages are compatable, then check the logs from apache.
[negative]	[14:32]	<Lakrits>	Anyone have any idea why it crashes and reboots just a few seconds into the boot?
[negative]	[14:32]	<poe>	saloxin: would i be helpful if i send dmesg over? :|

[neutral]	[14:33]	<slvmecha>	it's a 64-bit laptop
[negative]	[14:33]	<slvmecha>	or do i use the x86 version

[neutral]	[14:34]	<lamego>	slvmecha, yes, you can
[positive]	[14:34]	<saloxin>	slvmecha: i always found x86_64 flaky and uses i386. but if you feel adventorous :-)
[neutral]	[14:34]	<ocicat>	Yes, slvmecha, but try the 64 bit version first.
[neutral]	[14:34]	<haru_>	someone help me  install apache and php on gutsy
[negative]	[14:34]	<ocicat>	7.10 has better 64bit support.
[positive]	[14:34]	<umop>	It's worth trying 64bit
[neutral]	[14:35]	<gryfie_>	dual core is ony 32 bit
[neutral]	[14:35]	<Lakrits>	Ok, noone has any idea then.

[neutral]	[14:37]	<haru_>	mechdave, installed, yet php isnt being parsed

[negative]	[14:37]	<edaniel>	 My screen goes to black after the Ubuntu loadbar is finished every other time I startup, The OS is running (startup sounds play) but I can't see anything.

[negative]	[14:37]	<slvmecha>	what's the ram limit on 32/64 bit ubuntu's
[negative]	[14:37]	<saloxin>	poe: why are you booting with acpi=off?
[positive]	[14:37]	<geoaxis>	dooglus:  i always do clean install ...upgrades do alot of clutter in any case
[neutral]	[14:38]	<ocicat>	32bit uses only 4 GB.
[neutral]	[14:38]	<NotSure>	I would like to address my issue to ubuntu community support via email. Could somebody please provide me with that email?
[neutral]	[14:38]	<geoaxis>	(i just rsync my home dir)
[positive]	[14:38]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Deformation: check for similar bug reports (against ACPI) in at @HLINK and if you can't find a similar one, create a new one against linux-source-2.6.22
[negative]	[14:38]	<gnychis>	after upgrading to gutsy, my keyboard's right alt key no longer works... i used to have the shortcut of alt and + to maximize a window, but now it only works if I use my left alt... any ideas?
[negative]	[14:38]	<poe>	saloxin: cos i thought that would solve the problem... i googled and found something like it, but it didn't help
[negative]	[14:38]	<haru_>	mechdave, any ideas?
[positive]	[14:38]	<mechdave>	haru_: It is an issue with php.ini, perhaps you could try #apache2
[negative]	[14:38]	<slvmecha>	IntuitiveNipple: how do i set up kvm-vt?
[neutral]	[14:38]	<gnomefreak>	NotSure, go to lists.ubuntu.com and join the ubuntu-users mailing list

[neutral]	[14:41]	<saloxin>	together with acpi=off
[positive]	[14:41]	<IntuitiveNipple>	Deformation: That could be it. If you can find similar bug reports add to them as much specific detail about your system as you can, and the dmesg/kern.log and output of lspci -nn and other reports asked for in the Wiki for bug reports
[negative]	[14:41]	<easytiger>	gah. why does the gnome power applet not step up my cpu when i plug in the power adaptor. The kde one does.. and has an option to manually increase it. but thegnome one doesn't.. how can i do this?

Or will I be forced to download the alternate and do a text install (which is fine, aside from download time, and it seems Ubuntu would have though of this)

[neutral]	[16:34]	<cox377>	tim167: any 86x can
[neutral]	[16:34]	<mauri_>	LjL: yes yes now it's works...thanks agin
[negative]	[16:34]	<luite>	lnknpk04: hm, I'd still guess there is something wrong with the module build setup, it should be able to find config.h
[negative]	[16:34]	<lnknpk04>	cox377, ENLWI-G2 wireless card.  trying to compile the linux drivers from vendor, getting errors. @HLINK
[positive]	[16:34]	<stefg>	jdod, the actaul boot loader is in the MBR of your XP-Drive, but it references /boot/grub/menu.lst on your ubuntu-drive
[neutral]	[16:34]	<saloxin>	metfan2007: remove splash and quiet from /boot/grub/menu.lst
[negative]	[16:35]	<tim167>	cox377 workably ? , i mean any idea how slow will it be ?
[negative]	[16:35]	<metfan2007>	saloxin, ok, I'll try... thanks
[negative]	[16:35]	<astro76>	tim167, do you plan to use it as a desktop? how much memory? with something that slow you probably want to try xubuntu (xfce)
[neutral]	[16:35]	<boubbin>	usser then follows a information of few packages, and above is told that  the info could be useful when reporting the problem, then info listed below is: These packages have unsolvede depencies; libxine1-plugins: depency:. libxine1-gnome (but not marked for installation) libxine1-kde  (but not marked for installation libxine1-console  (but not marked for installation
[negative]	[16:35]	<lnknpk04>	luite, i'm a novice at building stuff myself.  where is it running into issues?
[neutral]	[16:35]	<stefg>	jdod, do have an option in the Bios to select the device to boot from first?
[negative]	[16:35]	<fredl>	if you want your fanspeed controlled by Linux, should you enable ACPI in the BIOS or not?
[positive]	[16:35]	<cox377>	tim167: I've run it on plenty of 500's, just turn off some of the fancy graphics - actually i used 7.04 but i don't think there is much difference
[neutral]	[16:35]	<jdod>	yes
[neutral]	[16:35]	<tim167>	astro76, it would be for a very minimal installation, maybe with fluxbox...
[neutral]	[16:35]	<GuStGiBB>	hi does anyone have problems regarding Gusty 7.10???
[positive]	[16:36]	<lnknpk04>	luite, is it all when dealing with my headers?
[positive]	[16:36]	<zerodamage>	Hi.  Are the video-in / Capture capabilities of the All In Wonder supported such as the 7500 AIW?
[negative]	[16:36]	<astro76>	tim167, that would be good, gnome and kde would definitely be very slow

[neutral]	[16:36]	<saloxin>	fredl: enable acpi if you can
[neutral]	[16:36]	<jdod>	stefg: yes i do
[neutral]	[16:36]	<tim167>	cox377 ^ *such
[neutral]	[16:36]	<cox377>	tim167: alternatively you could using xubuntu for lighters
[negative]	[16:36]	<fredl>	jdod - I've installed the lm-sensors package, I am 100% sure that my BIOS can control the fan speed but under 7.10 the fans seem to be running too fast
[negative]	[16:37]	<lnknpk04>	nikolhs, how are you installing?  through synaptic, deb files, or tarbals
[neutral]	[16:37]	<zerodamage>	anyone?
[neutral]	[16:37]	<cox377>	tim167: lol for a 500mhz machine
[negative]	[16:37]	<scriptha>	I changed something in my /usr/lib file to get some codecs working, and now no program can start anymore. How do I check what I've done wrong and how do I fix it?
[negative]	[16:37]	<Balaams_Miracle>	f0rgeIf`: Why do you tell me that?
[negative]	[16:37]	<fredl>	jdod,saloxin - also, the 'sensors' readings appear to be nonsense, my CPU is freezing.
[negative]	[16:37]	<luite>	lnknpk04: I think there are 2 problemes, the errors with the INIT_WORK macro seem to indicate that this version is for another kernel. the other config.h include error (file not found, line 102) indicates that it's not correctly set up
[positive]	[16:37]	<stefg>	jdod, so you have to write grub's mbr part to the second (ubuntu) disk, and restore the XP-bootloader to the first disk. then let your BIOS look for the second disk first. If it's present it will boot grub, if it's disconnected the XP bootloader will be seen
[neutral]	[16:37]	<nanbudh>	would the 7.10 live cd have gparted on it?

[negative]	[16:38]	<tim__b>	some little problem i have with gutsy: my screen got darkend after 10 minutes of inactivity although i deactivated that feature in gnome-power-manager (in both profiles, accumulator and wired). DPMS is also deactivated in xorg.conf. (please highlight my nickname on answer, thanks)
[neutral]	[16:38]	<xjkx>	Ditters, it depends on how you installed
[negative]	[16:38]	<lnknpk04>	luite, ok.  I'm gonna call the manufacturer on this since they provide the driver.  though I doubt I'll get any support.
[negative]	[16:39]	<minus>	Ditters, sudo apt-get --purge remove evolution && sudo apt-get install evolution

[negative]	[16:39]	<GuStGiBB>	i mean it runs fine... top speed... but it suddenly freezes...
[negative]	[16:39]	<hendrixski>	ceed, if you shh through command line, just use apt-get remove
[negative]	[16:39]	<edubuntu>	I want it pointin back to the grub conf on this partition
[negative]	[16:39]	<fredl>	ceed - use apt-get remove or dpkg --purge

[positive]	[16:39]	<saloxin>	poe: just wait :-=
[negative]	[16:39]	<stefg>	jdod, reinstalling is no cure for that. you need to understand what is what with the bootloader
[negative]	[16:39]	<poe>	saloxin: ok

[neutral]	[16:40]	<hendrixski>	zerodamage, I'm having problems with the ATI 7500 as well
[neutral]	[16:40]	<astro76>	Ditters, keep in mind apt-get --purge won't delete your user data and settings in ~/.evolution

[negative]	[16:41]	<usser>	boubbin: looks like u have dependencies problem, u're running gutsy right?
[neutral]	[16:41]	<luite>	lnknpk04: the INIT_WORK macro ( include/linux/workqueue.h ) has changed between kernel 2.6.18 and 2.6.20, so you should get an updated version of the driver for gutsy
[neutral]	[16:41]	<Lord_Illidan>	bittorrent - deluge imho

[negative]	[16:41]	<xjkx>	fredl, has it something to  do with fluxbox project?
[negative]	[16:41]	<saxin>	hendrixski: I want a better one
[neutral]	[16:41]	<saxin>	uTorrent is nice.. but not for linux?
[negative]	[16:41]	<pipatron>	Don't use a new version of uTorrent though
[negative]	[16:42]	<saxin>	why not?
[negative]	[16:42]	<fredl>	xjkx - nope. torrentflux is a web application.
[negative]	[16:42]	<Ditters>	astro76: the problem is that this backup folder was created on 7.10, and now II'm using 7.04
[positive]	[16:42]	<cox377>	fredl: torrentflux is sweet : )
[neutral]	[16:42]	<boubbin>	usser gutsy (kubuntu)
[negative]	[16:42]	<zerodamage>	hendrixski:  the 3d abilities of the card are fine.  compiz-fusion worked out of the box on 7.10.  But using the card for mythtv is my concern.  I am not finding anything on the forums at all.
[negative]	[16:42]	<lnknpk04>	luite, ok.
[positive]	[16:42]	<pipatron>	saxin: They send unidentified packages back to the new owner
[negative]	[16:42]	<stefg>	jdod, no it won't remove the grub *config* but only the MBR-part (which is perfect , because it was on the wrong disk anyway). The you have to boot up ubunt from Live CD and do a grub install to (hd1) instead of (hd0)...
[neutral]	[16:42]	<brooklynhype>	anyone use ktoren ?
[positive]	[16:42]	<astro76>	Ditters, oh yeah right ;) you never said why you went back to 7.04

[negative]	[16:47]	<hendrixski>	kbrooks, if you would like a faster browser there's epiphany (a little faster) and opera (a lot of faster)

[positive]	[16:48]	<jerryb>	Can I go directly from Edgy to Gutsy by changing the repo list b4 launching the update manager?
[negative]	[16:48]	<kjm>	nanbudh, with separate / and /home partitions, I would maybe make / around 10 GB then.  That would be safe/
[negative]	[16:48]	<kevinly>	i have a laptop, but when i'm at home i connect it to a monitor, on windows the laptop would automatically power off the screen when the lid was shut, but in ubuntu it's on, how do i fix this?

[negative]	[16:48]	<AaronMT>	Hi, I have an ATI card with 7.10 in a laptop and I can not suspend/hibernate/resume without it crashing to a black screen. I believe SLUB exposes a bug in fglrx that manifests itself as a failure over suspend/resume. How can I fix this?

[negative]	[16:48]	<fritzchen>	how do i partition my hd after installation? i want to divide my active 180GB partition...

[neutral]	[16:49]	<_achilles_>	usser: I just tried updating today
[negative]	[16:49]	<hendrixski>	AaronMT, yeah, there's some problems with ATI cards atm... but those should get fixed in a week or two

[neutral]	[16:49]	<stefg>	fritzchen, /j #ubuntu-de, besser auf Deutsch
[negative]	[16:49]	<jerryb>	hendrixski, short answer!  So to be clear, I must first upg to feisty and thence to gutsy?
[positive]	[16:49]	<bsund>	deadcandance, type the question :)
[negative]	[16:49]	<nanbudh>	is there anyway that i can move my /home to the end of the disk without loosing contents? it is second last one right now
[neutral]	[16:49]	<chester66>	hello!
[negative]	[16:49]	<Joanki>	now that i have ubuntu, the menu bars are SO large... like in firefox, the icons
[negative]	[16:49]	<hendrixski>	jerryb, if you want to upgrade from edgy, do it one release at a time... so go to feisty then to gutsy
[neutral]	[16:49]	<Joanki>	it's like that for ALL of my programs
[neutral]	[16:49]	<Joanki>	WHY?
[negative]	[16:49]	<Joanki>	how do i fix
[neutral]	[16:49]	<Joanki>	it's hogging my screen
[positive]	[16:50]	<saloxin>	everybody upgrading to gutsy has of course read the release notes? @HLINK
[neutral]	[16:50]	<jerryb>	hendrixski, ok...thanks!
[negative]	[16:50]	<scriptha>	How is /usr/lib chmodded? I kinda of screwed it by accident :$ Can someone take a look?
[positive]	[16:50]	<hendrixski>	jerryb, if you have dapper... then when hardy herron comes out, you'll be able to upgrade directly to that... but that only works for LTS ... not for regular releases... for those you have to go incrementally
[negative]	[16:50]	<ghost>	hi, do i need to open/or download gnome session to get my audio to work? coz i cant hear anything
[positive]	[16:50]	<deadcandance>	bsund question :)
[neutral]	[16:50]	<kjm>	Joanki - your screen resolution is non optimal, reconfigure x
[neutral]	[16:50]	<astro76>	nanbudh, you'll probably have to clear the destination and copy it
[neutral]	[16:50]	<Joanki>	it is optimal, i just checked
[negative]	[16:50]	<kbrooks>	hendrixski, thats impossible
[neutral]	[16:51]	<nanbudh>	astro76: so it cannot be shifted somehow?
[negative]	[16:51]	<usser>	boubbin: ok try /usr/bin/kaffeince --verbose
[negative]	[16:51]	<hendrixski>	kbrooks, what's impossible?

[neutral]	[16:51]	<usser>	err *kaffeine
[negative]	[16:51]	<chester66>	I have a little question; how is pam_cracklib supposed to work? I enter a dictionary-based password, and passwd asks me for the confirmation of the password I entered
[negative]	[16:51]	<Joanki>	i want the icons to be smaller - in my windows, they were very petite
[negative]	[16:51]	<chester66>	is it correct?
[negative]	[16:51]	<Ditters>	aaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrgggggggggg i'm losing my mind... Evolution doesn't work. it says: Segmentation fault (core dumped). any Ideas?
[negative]	[16:51]	<westjd>	I am trying to mount an SMB share, and I got it to work, but I cant get the fstab right (because it didnt reconnect with restart) anyone think they can help me?
[neutral]	[16:51]	<kjm>	Joanki - what is your screen resolution?
[neutral]	[16:51]	<boubbin>	usser just blank. it gives nothing.
[neutral]	[16:51]	<ceed>	anyone from usa here?
[neutral]	[16:51]	<usser>	boubbin: bah damn
[negative]	[16:51]	<astro76>	nanbudh, If I'm not mistaken, ext3 cannot be moved, only grown or shrunk... but you can't move it anyway if there is a partition in the way
[neutral]	[16:51]	<westjd>	ceed, I am from USA
[neutral]	[16:51]	<hendrixski>	Joanki, that's your monitors defaul setting
[negative]	[16:51]	<Vlet>	Ditters: that could be a lot of things... maybe just try Thunderbird?

[neutral]	[16:52]	<hendrixski>	DevideZero, google it
[neutral]	[16:52]	<AaronMT>	!gobuntu
[positive]	[16:52]	<ubotu>	gobuntu is a freedom-focused flavour of Ubuntu. See @HLINK for more.
[neutral]	[16:52]	<nanbudh>	astro76: thanks. next ques: can i copy the contents from one partition to another form the live cd?

[negative]	[16:52]	<hak5fan>	Hi does someone know how to force vlc to use alsa?
[neutral]	[16:52]	<astro76>	nanbudh, you can copy partitions in gparted, or you can mount partitions and copy files, yes

[negative]	[16:53]	<Ditters>	hi all. how can i completely reinstall evolution?
[neutral]	[16:53]	<AaronMT>	!ask
[neutral]	[16:53]	<tehknow>	this is what I get from lspci -v @HLINK
[positive]	[16:53]	<ubotu>	Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)
[neutral]	[16:53]	<hak5fan>	It uses oss here and software mixing is not enableed in oss mode
[negative]	[16:53]	<Joanki>	the problem is that the menu bar and icons are like two inches big in evolution
[neutral]	[16:53]	<Joanki>	one inch in firefox
[negative]	[16:53]	<westjd>	ceed, do you know the location to the list?
[neutral]	[16:53]	<nanbudh>	astro76:thanks
[negative]	[16:53]	<Dagon>	where do I place CLASSPATH so it becomes visiable
[neutral]	[16:53]	<hendrixski>	mcquaid, remix5x2, ctrl-alt-backspace will restart your xserver
[neutral]	[16:53]	<ghost>	anyone with the same sound problem? (no sound)?
[negative]	[16:53]	<Vis>	Q: I'm trying to use the unofficial 3D windows plugin for compiz on feisty. (1GHz, 1GB, nvidia TI4200) Every time I activate the plugin, compiz crashes. What am I doing wrong?
[positive]	[16:53]	<kjm>	Joanki - what is the dpi setting?  Increasing the dpi may help.
[negative]	[16:53]	<astro76>	Ditters, you might want to specify your actual problem, as reinstalling hasn't seemed to help
[negative]	[16:53]	<Joanki>	how can i make it smaller? i don't like feeling like my screen has shrunk
[negative]	[16:53]	<picard_pwns_kirk>	Ditters: sudo apt-get --purge remove evolution or something like that
[negative]	[16:53]	<Joanki>	how do i find out dpi setting?
[negative]	[16:53]	<mr_wang>	just downloaded 7.10 how do i do checksum???
[neutral]	[16:53]	<hendrixski>	Dagon, there's an EXPORT command in the Command Line
[negative]	[16:53]	<Joanki>	the only real problem is the size of the icon bar to be honest
[neutral]	[16:53]	<AaronMT>	!md5
[neutral]	[16:53]	<Joanki>	menu bar
[neutral]	[16:53]	<ubotu>	To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see @HLINK or @HLINK
[neutral]	[16:53]	<kjm>	Joanki - by reconfiguring x
[neutral]	[16:53]	<ceed>	westdj: i think its /usr/apt/
[negative]	[16:54]	<kbrooks>	hendrixski, you can't upgrade from X.YY to Z.AA where Y-Z doesn't equal 1. in english: you can't upgrade from dapper drake to hardy heron because the versions of both are 6.06 and 8.04, respectively. you have to upgrade from dapper to edgy, then edgy to feisty. then feisty to gutsy, and finally hardy heron. OR you can reformat.
[negative]	[16:54]	<Joanki>	how do i do that, krm
[negative]	[16:54]	<Ditters>	picard: it doesn't work
[neutral]	[16:54]	<Joanki>	kjm
[neutral]	[16:54]	<Ditters>	astro76: now it says: Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[positive]	[16:54]	<hendrixski>	Dagon, I don't know if there's an easier way, but if you go to the terminal, there may be a man page for it :-)
[negative]	[16:54]	<astro76>	Ditters, right, I'm saying when you repeat your question, specify all the details, you are wasting a lot of time
[negative]	[16:54]	<picard_pwns_kirk>	Ditters: why do you want to completely remove it?
[negative]	[16:54]	<jAk>	did anybody get my question? hmmm busy here
[negative]	[16:54]	<mr_wang>	just downloaded 7.10 how do i do checksum???
[negative]	[16:54]	<Heaven>	anyone there playing runescape via browser? I got a little problem maybe someone can help
[neutral]	[16:54]	<sparr>	my boot partition is full...  didnt see that coming.  need to clean out old kernels.  any tricks to that, or just remove the packages linux-image packages?
[positive]	[16:54]	<astro76>	Ditters, which you didn't want to do to fix the problem with 7.10 ;)
[neutral]	[16:54]	<DevideZero>	hendrixski , i didnt found the official site of the dist ... it have one ?
[neutral]	[16:55]	<Jo3>	hendrixski, well, im running a pci express card , and it says pci 0:16:0, is that right?
[neutral]	[16:55]	<kjm>	Joanki : $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[negative]	[16:55]	<Joanki>	ok ty
[positive]	[16:55]	<saloxin>	ZAKhan: you need the plugin package as well. search in add/remove
[negative]	[16:55]	<hendrixski>	kbrooks, you can update from one LTS to another, at least what I heard, so that companies who use those don't have to re-install every six months, or spend days to update to the next one
[neutral]	[16:55]	<Ditters>	astro76: at 7.10 it was a bug. here it's a problem
[neutral]	[16:55]	<edubuntu>	Anyone help me with GRUB?
[negative]	[16:55]	<Ditters>	astro76: i can't fix bugs
[negative]	[16:55]	<hendrixski>	kbrooks, I'll argue about it with you another day, I'm trying to answer help requests here
[negative]	[16:55]	<Heaven>	anyone there playing runescape via browser? I got a little problem maybe someone can help
[negative]	[16:55]	<kbrooks>	hendrixski, sounds impossible to me.

[neutral]	[16:55]	<Jo3>	hendrixski, pci express bus identifier pci 1:0:0 ?
[neutral]	[16:56]	<brooklynhype>	are there widget like applications ?
[negative]	[16:56]	<hendrixski>	DevideZero, the official site of Ubuntu?  there's ubuntu.com and for help you can go to ubuntuforums.com... is that what you were asking for?
[negative]	[16:56]	<tehknow>	so no-one is able to help me???
[negative]	[16:56]	<hendrixski>	Jo3, I usually go with the defaults on there
[negative]	[16:56]	<Avatar2>	"hi, I'm trying to browse my mobile phone via bluetooth, using the bluetooth icon ubuntu placed by default on my tray, but it says ""obex://[00:16:20:84:a5:51]"" is not a valid location.     how should I correct this?"

[negative]	[16:56]	<saloxin>	jAk: very very bad. consider reinstalling, or using a live cd to recover data you'll miss and reinstall
[negative]	[16:56]	<tehknow>	I have no sound
[negative]	[16:56]	<Joanki>	crap it says: for users of powerpc machines and users of any computer with multiple vide devices should specify the BusID o fthe video card in an accepted bus-specific format

[negative]	[16:56]	<NoObik>	i heard some ppl in forums saying that it was the module stack that is 4k or 8k and the driver needs 16k
[neutral]	[16:56]	<tehknow>	that shows my card is recognised by the computer

[negative]	[16:57]	<pipegeek>	Am I imagining things, or is it impossible to set more than two virtual desktops in gutsy?
[negative]	[16:57]	<Joanki>	when possible, this question has been pre-answered for you and you should accept the default unless you know it doesn't work
[negative]	[16:57]	<Joanki>	and then it says <ok>
[negative]	[16:57]	<kbrooks>	pipegeek, nope. not so.
[negative]	[16:57]	<Joanki>	i hit enter nothing happens
[negative]	[16:57]	<hendrixski>	edubuntu, you want to remove one of your partititions and get the space back, and then edit grub to not look at that other partition, right?
[neutral]	[16:57]	<Ditters>	a

[negative]	[16:58]	<pipegeek>	kbrooks: how is it done (through the gui)?  Because I see no way to do it
[negative]	[16:58]	<astro76>	Ditters, what you did to cause the problem, what you have tried, what are the symptoms, etc...
[neutral]	[16:58]	<Axos>	Dagon: If you are using gnome, set CLASSPATH in ~/.gnomerc
[positive]	[16:58]	<hendrixski>	edubuntu, gparted can do that for you... and the first partition you had has the orriginal GRUB which only loads that partition, so you may not even have to edit the grb.conf file :-)
[negative]	[16:58]	<tehknow>	woops cox377 thats what I get in the sound preference pane

[neutral]	[17:00]	<pipegeek>	Vlet: again, that doesn't actually work if you're running compiz.

[negative]	[17:05]	<Joanki>	ok i'm sorry to keep asking this question, but the screen resolution and EVERYTHING is fine except for the size of the icons - you know in firefox how it has the back forward icons?  you can easily adjust that to make them SMALL icons so they don't hog your screen - how do i do that for evolution or other applications?
[negative]	[17:05]	<saloxin>	jAk: it might be possible to correct. but it's pita and should be avoided
[neutral]	[17:05]	<brooklynhype>	like to use desktop widgets on ubuntu?
[negative]	[17:05]	<johncub>	saloxin, I was rather hoping it would have made it to /lost+found or somewhere.  shrug
[negative]	[17:05]	<hendrixski>	Joanki, are you sure it's not a firefox theme you installed?
[negative]	[17:06]	<vocx>	brooklynhype, what? I don't get what you are asking.
[negative]	[17:06]	<hendrixski>	Joanki, or is it all applications, and not just firefox?
[negative]	[17:06]	<Qahwaji>	hendrixski, i never used fiesty, but before that i used to get it to work by changing some settings for wireless, but now neither wired or wireless works, plus takes about 15 mins to start up
[negative]	[17:06]	<kbrosnan>	Joanki: you would need to find a gnome theme with small icons
[neutral]	[17:06]	<Creepindacellar>	can anyone help with a wireless network setup in 7.10
[neutral]	[17:06]	<johncub>	Joanki, have you tried other overall themes for gnome?
[negative]	[17:06]	<Joanki>	no firefox is fine now
[negative]	[17:06]	<astro76>	Joanki, in Feisty you can change that in System > Preferences > Menu and Toolbar Preferences, I'm not sure if it's the same in Gutsy
[negative]	[17:06]	<Vis>	Brooklynhype: Sounds like you need to look at either Screenlets or gdesklets

[neutral]	[17:07]	<jAk>	saloxin : forgive me. What is you recommandation?
[negative]	[17:07]	<saloxin>	johncub: but that might be huge
[neutral]	[17:07]	<Vis>	np
[positive]	[17:07]	<astro76>	Joanki, there you can change it to icons only which makes it small
[neutral]	[17:07]	<libervisco>	I remember Feisty doing the same, but it worked after I set the resolution myself, now that doesn't work either
[neutral]	[17:07]	<Creepindacellar>	im not sure but i have no connection

[neutral]	[17:48]	<telekine>	indio: yes we can
[negative]	[17:48]	<Can0beans_>	I turned on compiz last night and it worked like a champ.  Started up this morning and now all I get is a black desktop wallpaper.  Looked at Xorg.log and syslog and found nothing.  Any other suggestions on where i should look to see what the problem is?
[negative]	[17:48]	<ezebe>	can i disable the x-extensions in gutsy? they never worked with my ancient nvidia card in feisty, but now i think they're screwing me by default.
[neutral]	[17:48]	<AirBender>	Creepindacellar, after it finishes, you will be able to enable the nvidia-glx-new just clicking in the restricted drivers manager, or if you want, by installing the package from Synaptic Package Manager
[negative]	[17:48]	<NemesisD>	"saloxin, ok its connected did you mean literally the command ""sudo dpkg --configure -a / apt-get -f install"" ?"
[negative]	[17:48]	<vanberge>	is there any way to just run the ubuntu installation from the cd?  vs. starting the stupid live cd and installing from there?
[negative]	[17:48]	<valmarko>	ompaul, that means that, if I test the ports using, for example, www.grc.com, the system will pass ?
[negative]	[17:48]	<fredl>	luk3 - you chose to use the entire disk ?
[neutral]	[17:48]	<Creepindacellar>	ok thanks
[negative]	[17:48]	<saloxin>	indio: if the live cd is giving you trouble you might try the alternate cd

[neutral]	[17:48]	<saloxin>	NemesisD: 2 commands, separated by /
[negative]	[17:48]	<penguin42>	vanberge: There is an 'alternate CD' that is just an installer
[negative]	[17:48]	<MrBister>	Can someone tell me how to install drivers for Soundblaster Audigy 2?
[positive]	[17:48]	<luk3>	fredl no i have a 75 gig drive with 20 for xp

[neutral]	[17:49]	<penguin42>	joerack: 950 is graphics ?
[negative]	[17:49]	<ompaul>	valmarko, it should be nice unless you installed some server software it should be like a sink on the internet
[negative]	[17:49]	<saloxin>	NemesisD: yep
[negative]	[17:49]	<sinisterguy>	it there any way to dual boot os x and ubuntu without bootcamp?

[negative]	[17:49]	<vanberge>	penguin42, i saw that...  but is there any other way? or is that it..
[neutral]	[17:49]	<joerack>	Intel GMA 950 integrated
[negative]	[17:49]	<luk3>	gsty was a system update not a fresh install
[positive]	[17:49]	<fredl>	luk3 - when you choose XP, does it start up and break somewhere ?
[negative]	[17:49]	<saloxin>	indio: at least you get it installed and more tools to fix the resolution problems
[neutral]	[17:49]	<ompaul>	valmarko, and grc is aimed a t insecure windows not the tank that is Linux
[negative]	[17:49]	<Can0beans_>	I should also mention, I'm running Gutsy
[negative]	[17:49]	<indio>	Just thought it would be possible to boot the live CD in a custom screen resolution.
[positive]	[17:49]	<penguin42>	vanberge: Not really, alternate is the way to do it if you don't want the prettyness of the live cd
[neutral]	[17:49]	<luk3>	no it does not even load jus stays in the menu
[negative]	[17:49]	<vanberge>	penguin42, otherwise i might just do a clean install of 7.04 and do the distribution update with update manager
[negative]	[17:50]	<saloxin>	indio: might be. push F3 or somesuch at the prompt
[negative]	[17:50]	<ompaul>	"GRocket, so I would type ""about:config"" in the browser and filter for IPv6 and turn it off"
[negative]	[17:50]	<Al-Khouli>	Does anyone have an idea about establishing a connection via bluetooth on gutsy ??
[neutral]	[17:50]	<penguin42>	joerack: I think a 950 should just work
[neutral]	[17:50]	<fredl>	luk3 - do sudo fdisk /dev/hda, type 'p' to print the partition information and tell me which partitions you see
[negative]	[17:50]	<zulfiqar>	saloxin, is there an easy guide to make it work for firefox?
[neutral]	[17:50]	<penguin42>	joerack: Most of the intel graphics cards just mostly work
[neutral]	[17:50]	<valmarko>	ompaul, could you suggest me another site ? thank you
[negative]	[17:50]	<Daedalus_Prime>	So does anyone have any other ideas on how to get the Linsys USB adapter to work under 7.10? I looked at the docs, nothing. I tried upper and lower case for my key in every type of option the connection wizard offered, nothing.
[neutral]	[17:50]	<vocx>	"fredl, luk3 use ""sudo fdisk -l"""
[negative]	[17:50]	<MrBister>	Can someone tell me how to install drivers for Soundblaster Audigy 2?
[negative]	[17:50]	<joerack>	penguin42: unfortunately my max resolution is 1024 so I doubt it
[negative]	[17:50]	<saloxin>	zulfiqar: dunno. should be. check wiki.ubuntu.com
[negative]	[17:51]	<penguin42>	joerack: So you mean it's working but the resolution is wrong?
[negative]	[17:51]	<luk3>	ok have one
[neutral]	[17:51]	<MrBister>	no here using audigy soundcard??
[positive]	[17:51]	<fredl>	luk3 so you still see your XP partition?
[negative]	[17:51]	<ompaul>	"valmarko, you have missed the point, point grc at your machine by all means. However ""insecure"" on windows is not the same as ""not locked up"" GNU/Linux"
[positive]	[17:51]	<indio>	Bye thanks all.
[neutral]	[17:51]	<bulmer>	Daedalus_Prime: without encryption, does it work?

[negative]	[18:10]	<vocx>	sen5421, it would be useful to give information about your card... otherwise I can't guess
[negative]	[18:10]	<Foxdie>	all I gets a flashing cursor until I ctrl+alt+F2 and then I only get a shell prompt, I was expecting some kind of installer
[negative]	[18:10]	<mehevi>	hi guys,  I have a problem.  When I start my xfce4 session, I get three instances of nm-applet (networkmanager applet) running.  I've edited it completely out of my xfce startup programs file but it still runs three times.  Where is it being called from so I can pare it down to only one instace?
[negative]	[18:10]	<charles>	<Foxdie>changing sources.list from fiesty to gutsy is the only way i could get the upgrade to work, still having a few problems though
[negative]	[18:10]	<Tomi_G>	mehevi: I checked there, but hda5 is just an empty folder..
[negative]	[18:11]	<jnc>	d90: the instructions you've found were applicable to the development phase of Gutsy, now that it is released... I don't know

[negative]	[18:11]	<bruenig>	sen5421, I have been telling you that the network interface has not broken, the abstraction which launches the modules and daemons is deceiving you, it is that front end which is not succeeding, I was trying to get information as to whether or not it used the ipw3945 module along with its userspace daemon or the new firmware which doesn't require a userspace daemon and then you starting getting all whiny
[negative]	[18:11]	<Bax>	what command do I use in the terminal to copy a directory?

[negative]	[18:12]	<zulfiqar>	can i open Nautilus with root rights?
[positive]	[18:12]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  vnc is very very fleciable and confiurable.. make a new user, and have that user run the vncserver program is one way
[neutral]	[18:12]	<picard_pwns_kirk>	zulfiqar: yes
[negative]	[18:12]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  you are sharing the 'current running desktop' ? or how are you starting vnc?
[negative]	[18:12]	<surviver>	Dr_willis, so aah i get it thx
[negative]	[18:12]	<apollo2011>	Can I reboot safely if the update manager appears to have crashed halfway throught the upgrade procedure but apt doesn't show any packages that need to be updated?
[negative]	[18:12]	<jnc>	zulfiqar: I don't know if there's a menu item for it, but I bet you could do gksu -c nautilus

[positive]	[18:13]	<zulfiqar>	jnc, thanks
[negative]	[18:13]	<jnc>	apollo2011: yeah
[neutral]	[18:13]	<mehevi>	Tomi_G well first type 'mount' by itself and it'll tell where every device is mounted, tell me what filesystem your storage drive uses too
[negative]	[18:13]	<jnc>	apollo2011: should be cool
[positive]	[18:13]	<surviver>	Dr_willis, but i know what u mean thx ill fix it :))
[negative]	[18:13]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  you can even make vnc spawn as needed and give out a GDM/login screen with a little work.
[positive]	[18:13]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  but then those type of vnc sessions quit after the user log out. may not be what yiou want
[negative]	[18:13]	<Dumptruck>	"jnc ""you wanted to edit boot.ini on NTFS?"" yes - from Ubuntu"

[positive]	[18:16]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  i normally just have the 2nd guy ssh in, and start up vncserver manually. :) then he can start whatever vncclient he likes.
[negative]	[18:16]	<bruenig>	sexcopter, us or any of the others, I don't know how much mirror proximity to you is important for speed, I figured they just do that to spread out the demands more evenly

[negative]	[18:19]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  heck. you could install 'xming' and let the users run specific apps on the linxu box and have them appear on the windows machines.
[neutral]	[18:19]	<eriks>	foxdie-> yes to restart x.org
[negative]	[18:19]	<pwner4once>	kyled... eerr... then i have no idea. maybe use Livecd to get all ur stuff and do a fresh install ? O_O?
[negative]	[18:19]	<vocx>	Daedalus_Prime, it's the same. The same thing applies. You need proper Windows drivers with ndiswrapper that is all.
[negative]	[18:19]	<Foxdie>	um, that won't work if I'm in a text based console with a flashing cursor right?

[negative]	[18:24]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  a good thing to read is the actual 'vncserver' script (yes the command is just a large script that calls the real programs) it has a lot of comments.info

[negative]	[18:29]	<stefg>	dhamma, check if all dependencies are met and install missing packages, then deinstall all leftovers which were installed as dep's but are no longer  needed
[negative]	[18:29]	<gharz>	jnc... maybe there's GUI in setting up a DNS...
[positive]	[18:29]	<ompaul>	darkangel_, backup backup backup and try a fresh install might be a better idea - make sure you have more than one live CD handy :)

[negative]	[18:30]	<jnc>	gharz: I would check /etc/hosts and be sure that it's okay
[negative]	[18:30]	<bruenig>	sen5421, I haven't been following what they have been instructing you to do, so unless you have tried to get it going from the cli exclusively, a bug report will be useless. Also, unless other distros have their own kernel (and they don't) you won't find anything else. Kernel stuff is all the same.
[negative]	[18:30]	<vocx>	sen5421, check if there is an existing bug. And add info there. But hey, I think lots of guys are using Intel without problems.
[positive]	[18:30]	<skotos>	Thanks to everyone who helped me earlier. Everything seems to be running fine now!

[negative]	[18:31]	<sen5421>	bruenig, YES... I know how to use route and IP to configure my eth0... that was the first thing I tried without anyones help.
[negative]	[18:31]	<bruenig>	sen5421, but if you don't really care how stuff works and just want to throw stuff out there until by some miracle something happens, (a more involved derivative of click and pray), then maybe installing a different distro for this trivial of a thing would suit you
[neutral]	[18:31]	<gharz>	jnc: yes... i think u r right with that...
[neutral]	[18:31]	<penguin42>	bruenig: Most of the other distros have much heavily patched kernels than Ubuntu

[neutral]	[18:33]	<bruenig>	sen5421, ubuntu doesn't develop ipw3945 or iwl3945
[neutral]	[18:33]	<dhamma>	stefg: ok...thanks
[negative]	[18:33]	<sen5421>	vocx, okay, sounds like an okay rule.
[negative]	[18:33]	<jnc>	yeah I have a box I'm updating, we'll see if that blows up
[neutral]	[18:33]	<bruenig>	or ipconfig
[negative]	[18:33]	<Tigerman>	how can i get the DMI BIOS info?
[neutral]	[18:33]	<racarter>	what is the nmap ui package called?
[neutral]	[18:33]	<saloxin>	Tigerman: dmidecode
[positive]	[18:33]	<c_plus_plus>	Hello, when i try to run 'compiz --replace' it gives me the error 'checking for Xgl: not present'
[negative]	[18:33]	<sen5421>	bruenig, ipw3945 and iwl3945 are not the issue I KNOW that. I never said they were.
[neutral]	[18:34]	<jnc>	c_plus_plus: that's nice to know your Xgl is absent
[negative]	[18:34]	<c_plus_plus>	jnc, but how do i make it work
[negative]	[18:34]	<quodlibetor>	is there any logging i can turn on to figure out why my new 7.10 install is freezing more than once an hour?
[negative]	[18:34]	<racarter>	nmap.. there's a gnome tool for that right?
[negative]	[18:34]	<RonLut>	Hi, i have ubuntu 7.10 installed and i can't open *.aspx pages with firefox... and when it's searching for plugins it's finding nothing, help please?
[negative]	[18:34]	<bruenig>	sen5421, but everything else involved in getting the network going is the same, front ends differ, but they are all using the same ifconfig iwconfig iwlist and so forth, if you can't get it going using those tools, no front end should help you
[negative]	[18:34]	<sen5421>	"bruenig, what I am saying is ""This RELEASE of Ubuntu is broken"" I simply installed it to default and now my connection on eth0 and eth1 are dysfunctional."
[neutral]	[18:34]	<racarter>	aspx pages render to html.. you shouldn't have to install anything
[neutral]	[18:34]	<jnc>	c_plus_plus: find a howto on enabling Xgl with Gutsy
[negative]	[18:34]	<Lnknpk04>	I installed the restricted ATI driver because the first time i did, i didn't have any problems.  Now i cant get picture on my lcd because it says that the resolution is wrong.  how can i get into the fstab file to change it before ubuntu boots up
[positive]	[18:35]	<skotos>	I want to add bluetooth to my laptop. Can anyone recommend a pcmcia or usb bluetooth adapter that will work out of he box with Gutsy?
[negative]	[18:35]	<sen5421>	bruenig, also... I never said I was looking for a front end solution.
[negative]	[18:35]	<c_plus_plus>	jnc: umm... ok
[neutral]	[18:35]	<racarter>	nmap.. has anyone ever heard of nmap?
[neutral]	[18:35]	<jnc>	Lnknpk04: fstab does not control this
[negative]	[18:35]	<Ashfire908>	is there a way do get the xorg.conf file to be reconfigured, via a method other than editing the file directly
[negative]	[18:35]	<episodic>	irssi is complicated how do you get a channel listing that you can use?
[negative]	[18:35]	<racarter>	there's a gui tool for that on gnome, right?
[negative]	[18:35]	<RonLut>	"racarter but it's says ""a plugin is missing"" and finding nothing... and then i see empty page... (on windows it's working)"
[negative]	[18:35]	<Lnknpk04>	jnc, what does?  how could i get in there to fix the issue
[positive]	[18:35]	<drama1981>	anybody can help me with radeon xpress 200 on gutsy?
[neutral]	[18:35]	<sen5421>	"bruenig, all I want is to find WHAT CODE in ""gutsy"" causes this issue so I can fix it."
[positive]	[18:35]	<gharz>	jnc: i'd greatly appreciate if you could help me fix my DNS issue.
[negative]	[18:35]	<jnc>	episodic: uh... if you figure that one out, let me know
[negative]	[18:35]	<sen5421>	bruenig, it seems elusive at this point
[negative]	[18:35]	<racarter>	i dont think it has anything to do with the .aspx extension
[negative]	[18:35]	<racarter>	it probably has a java or flash applet in it
[neutral]	[18:36]	<saloxin>	racarter: apt-cache search nmap
[neutral]	[18:36]	<RonLut>	other pages are not opening too...
[positive]	[18:36]	<surviver>	"Dr_willis, hey u maybe know if ur still here, when i use a certain app (krfb) , and run it (it works as vnc) other users and i get this ""RFB 003.003"", on the @HLINK:port..."
[negative]	[18:36]	<bruenig>	sen5421, no but my point is that, every distro, whether they have different front ends or not, are in one way or another using those tools that you are aware of ifconfig iwconfig iwlist wpa_supplicant and so forth, if you aren't able to get it going with those on cli, then it doesn't matter where you go because everything uses those
[neutral]	[18:36]	<jnc>	gharz: privmsg is easier for me to track
[negative]	[18:36]	<RonLut>	ok so..?
[neutral]	[18:36]	<PanicByte>	liberum, well i was having the same problem, i knew it had something to do VLC settings, cause gstreamer settings were good, and other media players were working fine
[negative]	[18:36]	<vocx>	sen5421, head to launchpad, they have the code there for any package for any version of Ubuntu.
[negative]	[18:36]	<racarter>	yeah i searched for nmap and i didnt see a gui tool there
[neutral]	[18:36]	<racarter>	maybe im blind ill check again
[positive]	[18:36]	<liberum>	PanicByte: Well... it sort of worked.. but now the framerate it to slow :) i'm starting to think it's the graphics driver
[negative]	[18:36]	<episodic>	is there a built in list of servers in irssi - if I had not of guessed to type /server irc.ubuntu.com  I would have been dead in the water
[neutral]	[18:36]	<usser>	Ashfire908: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xorg
[neutral]	[18:36]	<sen5421>	bruenig, then what is /etc/init.d/networking ?
[neutral]	[18:36]	<toko123>	@HLINK
[neutral]	[18:36]	<saloxin>	racarter: ah - enable universe in your sources.list.
[neutral]	[18:36]	<bruenig>	sen5421, it is a script
[neutral]	[18:36]	<rescine>	Vrooom: for guides on dualbooting just ask the google @HLINK
[positive]	[18:36]	<MTecknology>	"I installed Windows then Ubuntu, I created separate partitions for each beforehand... I have this error when I try to boo windows... ""A kernel file is missing from the disk. Insert a system diskette and restart the system."""

[positive]	[18:37]	<surviver>	Dr_willis, ok :)) but somehwere i read that i had to pay to use vnc
[positive]	[18:37]	<penguin42>	MTecknology: From Ubuntu check the partition list with fdisk -l and check it is what you thought it should be
[positive]	[18:37]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  krfb seems to share the currently running desktop. is that what you really want? :)
[positive]	[18:37]	<PanicByte>	because it's working fine for me now
[neutral]	[18:37]	<sen5421>	bruenig, something that manages the networking within Ubuntu is not working for me... period.
[negative]	[18:37]	<Tigerman>	saloxin, but dmidecode only comes in the source code... how can i transform it to be installable?
[neutral]	[18:37]	<Vrooom>	F**k this this isnt clear enough.
[negative]	[18:37]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  pay to use vnc? NEVER heard that befor.

[negative]	[18:37]	<toko123>	it's 68pin scsi but i'm concerned about the fiber channel
[negative]	[18:37]	<epidodi>	I guess xchat it is then - irssi seems really hard to use
[neutral]	[18:37]	<Tigerman>	./configure  make  make install   ???
[neutral]	[18:37]	<Dr_willis>	surviver,  its gpl'ed as far as i know.
[neutral]	[18:37]	<bruenig>	sen5421, it uses the same tools, like I am telling you, it is a front end. you can get the network going without that by cli. What I am saying is to get the network running from cli, and if you recognize the init scripts which front end for those tools are faulty in some way, then move on, but the tools themselves are the same
[neutral]	[18:37]	<racarter>	no i am blind.. it is called nmapfe
[neutral]	[18:37]	<vocx>	!anyone > drama1981
[negative]	[18:37]	<penguin42>	Tigerman: No, it's in a package - you can just install it

[negative]	[18:47]	<godzirra>	Huh.  Thats odd.  Gutsy?  I installed amarok and it worked fine for me.
[neutral]	[18:47]	<MerlinsLair>	think I'll hold off on an upgrade for a while
[neutral]	[18:47]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:I have it running here on an ATI AIW 9600
[neutral]	[18:47]	<lucaferr>	is bytecode interpreter enabled in freetype that comes with ubuntu 7.10?
[negative]	[18:47]	<Jaymac>	upgraded to gutsy... is there any way to easily update my nvidia graphics driver to the new one so that i don't get the black screen bug? is envy the best solution?
[neutral]	[18:47]	<mirak>	godzirra: I don't want to reinstall. my /home is separated too
[neutral]	[18:47]	<[chr0n0s]>	ckw, which drivers?
[neutral]	[18:47]	<godzirra>	mirak: I'm not sure about why it would fail though, since I haven't tried it.
[neutral]	[18:47]	<[chr0n0s]>	Jaymac, i think envy is more problem then a solution
[negative]	[18:47]	<riotkittie>	mirak: how far into the upgrade did you get? did it start at all?
[neutral]	[18:47]	<nik>	does anyone have experience with wireless in ubuntu ??
[negative]	[18:47]	<nekr0z>	godzirra: yes. it works. I only want to make the mune font smaller
[neutral]	[18:47]	<[chr0n0s]>	!envy | Jaymac
[negative]	[18:47]	<ubotu>	Jaymac: envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[neutral]	[18:47]	<nik>	wireless is a bitch
[neutral]	[18:47]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:I got the latest linux drivers from the ATI/AMD site
[negative]	[18:47]	<Tomi_G>	I can't mount my NTFS partition on Gutsy :((((((
[negative]	[18:47]	<kotau>	hey guys where is the startup list for xfce4?  I've checked ~/.config/autostart but that's not it, I have three instances of a program running at start and wanna pare it down to one
[neutral]	[18:47]	<riotkittie>	nik: what are your issues with wireless?
[negative]	[18:48]	<godzirra>	nekr0z: Right, I'm saying I don't know why the menu font is weird, since it worked fine for me. :/
[neutral]	[18:48]	<nik>	hello riotkittie
[negative]	[18:48]	<Jaymac>	[chr0n0s], then how do i tell restricted-manager to upgrade my nvidia drivers?
[neutral]	[18:48]	<nik>	ty
[positive]	[18:48]	<[chr0n0s]>	ckw, does the --buildpkg Ubuntu/gutsy option works with the binary ?
[negative]	[18:48]	<andrewss>	Hi, I have a problem resuming from hibernate on a dmcrypted disk after installing 7.10. any ideeas on how to debug this?
[neutral]	[18:48]	<nik>	one thing I have a new laptop
[negative]	[18:48]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: Are you using feisty or gutsy?
[neutral]	[18:48]	<nik>	hp dv 6500
[negative]	[18:48]	<mirak>	riotkittie: no it fails the first prerequesite, on all mirrors I tried. I am not the only one to have this problem
[negative]	[18:48]	<godzirra>	Feisty for some reason didn't detect my nvidia card.  Gutsy did.
[neutral]	[18:48]	<nik>	with some freakin card
[neutral]	[18:48]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, just upgraded to gutsy
[negative]	[18:48]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:that i cannot answer
[positive]	[18:48]	<nik>	that has no XP drivers
[neutral]	[18:48]	<nekr0z>	godzirra: the thing is, i made all fonts in GNOME 8, not 10. and it stays 10 in amarok
[negative]	[18:48]	<godzirra>	nekr0z: ahh.. not sure about that.  Sorry mate.
[negative]	[18:48]	<mirak>	riotkittie: that's a huge use case failure
[neutral]	[18:48]	<[chr0n0s]>	Jaymac, sorrry boss, no idea
[neutral]	[18:48]	<Jaymac>	still got the 9639 driver
[negative]	[18:49]	<skotos>	how can I find out if I have a bluetooth module in my laptop? What does the dev name look like?
[neutral]	[18:49]	<vocx>	!enter > nik
[positive]	[18:49]	<[chr0n0s]>	ckw, try it out if you still have the drivers saved somewhere
[negative]	[18:49]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: I think if you want to use the restricted drivers, you just upgrade the restricted drivers package.
[negative]	[18:49]	<pike_>	skotos: lspci -v might give you an idea
[neutral]	[18:49]	<aata>	ideas, anyone???
[negative]	[18:49]	<Dicey>	I'm trying to install Gutsy iso, but gparted isn't working correctly. I want to try the gparted and partition magic live cds. Do I burn them to cds just like the ubuntu iso?
[negative]	[18:49]	<penguin42>	nekr0z: Try running the KDE control centre and changing fonts there; it's called kcontrol - I'm not sure if that'll help, but amarok is more KDE than Gnome
[neutral]	[18:49]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:however even after the newest driver I am unable to extend my desktop to the second monitor
[negative]	[18:49]	<godzirra>	That may not get you the most up to date nvidia driver, but if you want the most up to date, you'll need to use the nvidia script from their site, or the envy script or something.
[negative]	[18:49]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, i think i have upgraded
[neutral]	[18:49]	<pike_>	Dicey: yes
[neutral]	[18:49]	<andrewss>	anyone here using 7.10 with dmcrypt ?
[negative]	[18:49]	<squidgy>	"Hi. Ever since upgrading, ""/usr/bin/X :0 -br -audit 0 -auth /var/lib/gdm/:0.Xauth -nolisten tcp vt7"" is eating half of my processor constantly.  Ideas on a fix?"
[neutral]	[18:49]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: then thats the most up to date driver in the restricted drivers package.
[positive]	[18:49]	<Dicey>	thanks
[positive]	[18:49]	<tuku>	Hi...I have gutsy installed on extranal hd and windows xp on laptop(work machine) hd. Is there any way to start that existing windows by virtualization from ubuntu?
[negative]	[18:50]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: if you want newer than that, you'll have to install via the nvidia/envy script.
[neutral]	[18:50]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, ok thanks
[negative]	[18:50]	<vocx>	"aata, please repeat your question, otherwise just asking ""anyone"" becomes annoying. But be patient."
[neutral]	[18:50]	<Niklas_E>	need to reboot and check gparted, bbl
[positive]	[18:50]	<Skwerl>	My Gutsy CD-ROM (created by Nero via ISO) won't boot, and won't mount in Feisty, but my Windows machine detects it just fine. And the CD-ROM drive on the Feisty box works with other CD's
[negative]	[18:50]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, i thought they'd updated to solve the black screen bug
[negative]	[18:50]	<[chr0n0s]>	ckw : i am still struggling for the first monitor :(
[negative]	[18:50]	<pike_>	Dicey: remember you need livecd if youre trying to resize usually as you cant resize a partition you have mounted
[neutral]	[18:50]	<liberum>	PanicByte: I also tried renaming ~/.vlc and completely removing VLC, then install it again
[negative]	[18:50]	<Sick_Fish>	Guys, I just installed linux ubuntu on my old me 2000 computer and I need some navigation help
[negative]	[18:50]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: Which card you have?  I had that problem with the install on feisty, but on gutsy it detected my card and used the nvidia driver no problem
[neutral]	[18:50]	<racarter>	@HLINK
[positive]	[18:50]	<nik>	well here is the problem , I have a new lappy ... I did some looking around and this is my 03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev 02)
[negative]	[18:50]	<liberum>	Sick_Fish: what are you looking for?
[negative]	[18:50]	<nekr0z>	penguin42: yeah, it would. but i don't feel like installing kcontrol for this. maybe someone knows the way to do it via editing config files?
[neutral]	[18:50]	<pike_>	Sick_Fish: ?
[negative]	[18:50]	<riotkittie>	mirak:  if you havent already done so, check your sources.lst - upgrade is failing for some people, but leaving their sources changed to the gutsy repos, rather than feisty or whatever they are using. which could be ugly.
[negative]	[18:50]	<danny3793>	I have an issue now after trying to upgrade to Gutsy from Feisty, I don't know what to do can someone help?
[negative]	[18:50]	<Dicey>	??? What do you mean?
[negative]	[18:50]	<Sick_Fish>	first question: how do I get to the cube thing?
[neutral]	[18:51]	<LifeNomad>	Sick_Fish: What navigation?
[positive]	[18:51]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:I was on here late last night(actually early this morning) trying to find someone who has had success
[neutral]	[18:51]	<tharis20>	hey
[negative]	[18:51]	<godzirra>	Sick_Fish: thats compiz or beryl.
[negative]	[18:51]	<stefg>	tuku, possible but dangerous. Requires a separate hardware profile for the virtual hardware, and might blow the setup if you change the wrong one when running native
[negative]	[18:51]	<Dicey>	I was going to do a live cd
[negative]	[18:51]	<tharis20>	how can i remove something
[neutral]	[18:51]	<LifeNomad>	Sick_Fish: Beryl, or Compiz Fusion
[neutral]	[18:51]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, geforce go 7400
[neutral]	[18:51]	<godzirra>	Beryl is deprecated, so I'd go with compiz.
[negative]	[18:51]	<Sick_Fish>	how do I get that?
[neutral]	[18:51]	<godzirra>	compiz fusion rather.
[negative]	[18:51]	<IanLiu>	I am trying to edit a file with 'sudo gedit', but it says I must have ROOT access.. How do I get it??
[neutral]	[18:51]	<godzirra>	Sick_Fish: google for ubuntu and compiz fusion
[neutral]	[18:51]	<pike_>	tharis20: in your synaptic package manager just unclick it and hit apply
[negative]	[18:51]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, the black screen bug is only a problem running compiz
[neutral]	[18:51]	<Sick_Fish>	compiz is better?
[negative]	[18:51]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: huh.. what is the problem exactly?
[neutral]	[18:51]	<Vrooom>	rescine   @HLINK
[positive]	[18:51]	<Grenadier>	IanLiu: sudo gives you root access
[neutral]	[18:51]	<vocx>	!beryl > Sick_Fish
[negative]	[18:51]	<rescine>	so, but gparted isn't working correctly. I want to try the gparted and partition magic
[negative]	[18:51]	<rescine>	          live cds. Do I burn them to cds just like the ubuntu iso?
[positive]	[18:52]	<godzirra>	Sick_Fish: its not necessarily better per se, but its still actively maintained, where as beryl is not.
[positive]	[18:52]	<LifeNomad>	Sick_Fish: its the same I believe, look in synaptic for the packages
[negative]	[18:52]	<IanLiu>	But I cant edit the file with sudo...
[negative]	[18:52]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:What is the --buildpkg option and why would I want to use it?
[neutral]	[18:52]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, with the nvidia driver, when i have too many windows open the graphics card runs out of memory and the windows are black
[neutral]	[18:52]	<pike_>	rescine: yes
[neutral]	[18:52]	<simplyubuntu>	is anyone using broadcom with gutsy?
[neutral]	[18:52]	<riotkittie>	IanLiu: try  gksu gedit   or gksudo  gedit
[neutral]	[18:52]	<godzirra>	Meaning that Compiz Fusion will get better, and Beryl will not.
[neutral]	[18:52]	<Jaymac>	they released an update that fixes it
[negative]	[18:52]	<godzirra>	simplyubuntu: yeah. Mine just worked.
[negative]	[18:52]	<IanLiu>	ok
[neutral]	[18:52]	<vocx>	!anyone > simplyubuntu
[negative]	[18:52]	<godzirra>	Jaymac: Huh.  I remember reading about that but haven't ran into it, unfortunately. :/
[negative]	[18:52]	<simplyubuntu>	can you tell me how, godzirra
[positive]	[18:52]	<godzirra>	well, good for me, unfortunately for you I suppose. :)
[positive]	[18:52]	<NemesisD>	saloxin, you still there?
[neutral]	[18:52]	<Vrooom>	you see that?
[negative]	[18:52]	<Jaymac>	godzirra, ok no worries
[neutral]	[18:52]	<[chr0n0s]>	ckw, to build debian packages from the ati binary drivers.. and you installed from livecd or alternate CD ?
[negative]	[18:52]	<godzirra>	simplyubuntu: I just installed gutsy and it worked.  I didn't actually need to do anything else.
[negative]	[18:52]	<saloxin>	NemesisD: yep
[negative]	[18:52]	<riotkittie>	Jaymac: ooh, that sounds like fun!

[negative]	[18:53]	<drama1981>	well im out maybe ill come back later and attempt to fix my prob, laterz
[negative]	[18:53]	<danny3793>	How do I continue the upgrade from Feisty to Gutsy, my upgrade failed, I can't mount my external HDD to backup my data and do a complete reinstall, I don't care about the programs currently installed as I can get them back after I get Gutsy installed
[positive]	[18:53]	<Jaymac>	riotkittie, what does exactly? ;)
[neutral]	[18:53]	<Sick_Fish>	the bot is telling me not to get beryl
[negative]	[18:53]	<simplyubuntu>	i see.. i enabled the restricted driver, but no interface such as wlan0 even exists....
[neutral]	[18:53]	<bmk789>	is there a separate room for amd64?
[neutral]	[18:53]	<riotkittie>	Jaymac: the nvidia issue. :|
[negative]	[18:53]	<NemesisD>	saloxin, ive been told to avoid this problem in the future to put /home on a separate partition, i have a 40gb drive in the machine, im giving 1gb to swap, how should i partition the rest?
[neutral]	[18:53]	<riotkittie>	bmk789: no
[negative]	[18:53]	<pike_>	Sick_Fish: no compiz included in gutsy is what you want
[negative]	[18:53]	<godzirra>	bmk789: not that I know of.
[negative]	[18:53]	<tuku>	stefg: ok thanks...maybe i give up that idea. Don't wanna mess up that work Windows Xp install
[neutral]	[18:53]	<gumpish_>	Is there an apt-spy for ubuntu repos??
[positive]	[18:53]	<Grenadier>	After I installed it, gnome-themes, and consequently gnome-accessibility-themes and ubuntu-desktop failed to install...and thus, it won't boot
[neutral]	[18:53]	<godzirra>	Ahh, I didnt realize compiz fusion was included in gutsy.
[negative]	[18:53]	<h|barbobot>	how does one enable compiz in kubuntu?
[neutral]	[18:53]	<Sick_Fish>	compiz and gutsy, got it, thanks guys
[neutral]	[18:53]	<Jaymac>	riotkittie, yeah... it's frustrating, figured the new driver would be available in gutsy
[negative]	[18:53]	<Grenadier>	It had a problem with libgdk-pixbuf
[neutral]	[18:53]	<Seveas>	!compiz-#kubuntu | h|barbobot
[neutral]	[18:53]	<ubotu>	h|barbobot: Kubuntu is not shipping with compiz installed or enabled by default. You can still install it and have your eyecandy goodness. The instructions are at @HLINK
[positive]	[18:53]	<pike_>	Sick_Fish: there is a compiz config manager too you can install that i would recommend but i dont have any 3d desktop exp
[neutral]	[18:53]	<Rabiddog>	when I press print screen I get  screenshot.sh not found

[positive]	[18:54]	<NemesisD>	saloxin, fair enough, thanks
[negative]	[18:54]	<crshman>	how do i get the compiz control panel and emerald settings in 7.10? is it pre-installed or do i have to install more packages?
[neutral]	[18:54]	<ckw>	[chr0n0s]:first time i installed from the live cd...but that was on release day and all of the update servers were choked...later on I did the upgrade online from a 7.04 install and that is where i am now
[negative]	[18:54]	<Rabiddog>	did I install something wrong with regards to compiz?
[negative]	[18:54]	<simplyubuntu>	godzirra any ideas?

[negative]	[19:23]	<arang2>	pike_: then why the speed difference? cos i know u can disable journalling but in that case i'd run XFS then
[negative]	[19:23]	<Garoth>	Ok, sorry to jump in...

[negative]	[19:24]	<riotkittie>	padee: if you go that route, you have to upgrade to edgy, then feisty, then gutsy
[neutral]	[19:24]	<hmuller>	padee:  you have to go from release to release
[positive]	[19:24]	<recon>	weird. bzflag is failing. the full error is at @HLINK

[negative]	[19:24]	<riotkittie>	lixoman100: no, i dont. sorry :|
[negative]	[19:24]	<Garoth>	I'm trying to get my external monitor to work with gutsy. It did in feisty, but now it just won't. Nvidia drivers.
[negative]	[19:24]	<Garoth>	Any ideas?
[positive]	[19:24]	<pike_>	arang2: ext3 isnt the fastest in the world. it never really claims to be. ntfs may well beat it in most speed areas but im no fs man
[negative]	[19:24]	<lixoman100>	riotkittie: Ok, thank you. I'll ask again on the channel then.
[positive]	[19:24]	<insllvn>	hello is a way to install 3rd party apps on a palm OS device with the pilot sync applet?
[neutral]	[19:24]	<JymmmEMC>	pike_: so it's some hdd indentifier of sorts?
[neutral]	[19:24]	<scguy318>	Garoth: does the Screen Configuration app help?
[negative]	[19:24]	<depinko>	how to activate numlock at startup in Ubuntu 7.10? the file /etc/X11/gdm/Init/Default doesn't exists in that system

[neutral]	[19:25]	<insllvn>	*is there a way
[negative]	[19:25]	<saloxin>	a lot of acpi implementations are just broken. you might fix it by bios upgrade or hack away at your kernel dsdt tables. or do like me, ignore it untill next ubuntu release
[negative]	[19:25]	<hmuller>	Any gnome-panel font color changers in here?
[neutral]	[19:25]	<JymmmEMC>	Surb: yes
[negative]	[19:25]	<pike_>	JymmmEMC: basically if you move stuff around and hda1 is no longer hda1 everything will still work. i personally dont like it but for average config i guess its a good idea
[negative]	[19:25]	<Garoth>	And any attempt to make it generic will create a completely black screen until reboot
[positive]	[19:25]	<MFen>	riotkittie: is that blacklist maintained by compiz or by ubuntu?
[negative]	[19:25]	<arang2>	pike_: ok, so ext3 it is? anything that could be done to speed it up without sacrificing it's integrity?
[negative]	[19:25]	<Pacane>	Can someone tell where I can get some documentation about customizing my taskbars?
[negative]	[19:25]	<Creepindacellar>	i don't see compizconfig-settings-manager in the add/remove applications

[negative]	[19:26]	<saloxin>	penguin42: ? you know of one?
[negative]	[19:26]	<arang2>	saloxin:ok, do i edit fstab then? or there's a more elegant way to do so
[negative]	[19:26]	<scguy318>	Garoth: Nvidia, right? have you tried the nvidia-setting app? gksudo nvidia-setting

[neutral]	[19:27]	<wirechief>	this may help others but did not help me I had to use my xorg.conf from kanotix @HLINK

[negative]	[19:28]	<penguin42>	saloxin: There is mention here: @HLINK    that mutt gets upset by noatime
[neutral]	[19:28]	<arang2>	saloxin: most of the linux things are small files rite?
[positive]	[19:28]	<ExRarne>	I can't install Ubuntu because the LiveCD partitioner won't resize the NFTS partiton that XP is running on, what partitioner should I use?
[neutral]	[19:28]	<penguin42>	saloxin: But generally I agree, noatime is great
[negative]	[19:28]	<pike_>	arang2: modern flash has pretty high write numbers and it is pretty cheap but yeah
[negative]	[19:28]	<Tigerman>	saloxin, maybe the Linux kernel doesn't support my mobo to get the DMI BIOS year out of it... my mobo is from the year 2001, so if DMI BIOS year would be 2001, ACPI would be enabled by default (because it's a post-2000 mobo)   but Linux kernel doesn't seem to support the BIOS of my mobo so it can't retrieve (get) the info on DMI BIOS year of my mobo, hence it doesn't enable ACPI            right????

[negative]	[19:29]	<jinxed>	Can anyone help me with this? I upgraded to Gutsy today using the Update Manager. The upgrade seemed to go fine until the end.

[negative]	[19:30]	<Colro>	My monitor keeps shutting itself off after ~15-20min (never timed it) even though I don't have it enabled to do so in the power settings. Is this a bug or something? It's kind of annoying when watching DVDs.

[positive]	[19:31]	<saloxin>	Tigerman: year of acpi implementation should go away with acpi=force. so your bios acpi mplementaion is not just old, but also broken

Feisty had the same problem, but I could work around it by setting the resolution to 1600x1200 and then back to 1680x1050; this hack no longer works in gutsy.

[negative]	[20:07]	<TwoD>	I've can't get into the desktop after upgrading to Gutsy. Normal boot hangs after reading local script files. Starting gdm Recovery mode gives me a login prompt where I can log in, but how do I get to the actual desktop?

Right at the end of the upgrade, when cleanup was being done, I got a few errors... which I failed to record. Now when I boot, I get the login screen and after logging in, I get two error messages: 1. Nautilus can't be used now due to an unexpected error from Bonobo when attempting to register...
[neutral]	[20:07]	<jinxed>	...the file manager view server. 2. The panel has encountered a fatal error. The panel could not register with the bonobo-activation server (Error code: 3) and will exit. It may be automatically restarted.
[neutral]	[20:07]	<kousotu>	what is the rendering engine for Compiz-fusion?

[negative]	[20:08]	<tw2113>	i have one that acts like the bottom bar of OSX
[neutral]	[20:08]	<Pacane>	and some neat stuff..
[positive]	[20:08]	<Ashfire908>	vega-: i clicked delete on the second instance of gnome-control-panel that appears when you enable the frist one, and it deleted both
[neutral]	[20:08]	<nickrud>	TwoD: you actually get a graphical login screen?
[neutral]	[20:08]	<lazd>	kousotu: join #compiz-fusion
[negative]	[20:08]	<We3Share>	crdlb: No problem, I know it's crazy here....I am capable of following whatever direction, I've just never personally dealt w/ ATI issues...I have nvidia myself...
[negative]	[20:08]	<Davy_Jones>	Clinton__: i just go to a website with flash then let firefox plugin finder install it.. is that the same?
[positive]	[20:08]	<tw2113>	and 2 at the top for icons and window switchin
[negative]	[20:08]	<Clinton__>	Davy_Jones: nope
[neutral]	[20:08]	<crdlb>	"We3Share, well you should switch to the ""ati"" driver"
[neutral]	[20:08]	<crdlb>	you're using vesa now
[positive]	[20:08]	<Pacane>	Did you use a special tool to manage the themes and etc..?
[negative]	[20:08]	<Davy_Jones>	Clinton__: what's the difference?
[negative]	[20:08]	<TwoD>	nickrud, no, just the command-line one
[positive]	[20:08]	<ctw>	"Clinton__: Thanks for the tip about the release notes ... it says that for intel cards i need the old ""i810"" driver ... my xorg.conf specifies ""i810"" as a driver ... do I need to install an older version?"

[neutral]	[20:08]	<hasafraker>	greetings
[neutral]	[20:09]	<tw2113>	not really when it comes to panels
[negative]	[20:09]	<Clinton__>	ctw: not sure on the fix there, don't the release notes say?
[negative]	[20:09]	<Davy_Jones>	Clinton__: but the end result will be the same, yes?
[negative]	[20:09]	<akorn>	a514: I don't see a setting in there though?
[negative]	[20:09]	<tw2113>	mine aren't all that advanced either
[negative]	[20:09]	<Pacane>	Ok.
[negative]	[20:09]	<We3Share>	crdlb: when I enabled restricted...it rebooted and asked me what driver...I selected ATI and it rebooted back without change...But I selected opensource not proprietary...Should I use proprietary instead?
[negative]	[20:09]	<bananamuzzj>	Guys, after i installed fglrx 8.40.4 the direct rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
[neutral]	[20:09]	<bananamuzzj>	    GLX_ATI_pixel_format_float, GLX_ATI_render_texture
[neutral]	[20:09]	<tw2113>	contact the youtube people about it

[positive]	[20:09]	<Pacane>	:P
[negative]	[20:09]	<nickrud>	TwoD: ok, that's not gdm, but the console. Try sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg , and then telinit 2 to test
[neutral]	[20:09]	<Clinton__>	Davy_Jones: yes
[negative]	[20:09]	<bananamuzzj>	the installation didnt gave me any error :/
[positive]	[20:09]	<Davy_Jones>	Clinton__: thanks mate
[negative]	[20:09]	<tw2113>	i might actually go install gutsy soon
[neutral]	[20:09]	<bananamuzzj>	now my direct rendering is fucked
[neutral]	[20:09]	<crdlb>	We3Share, run sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
[positive]	[20:09]	<Clinton__>	Davy_Jones: I recommened using aptitude, it makes for a cleaner install and you'll get bug fixes
[negative]	[20:09]	<hasafraker>	I have what I hope is a small issue, I think I fat fingered my password exactly the same way when installing on a very slow laptop is there any why to correct that?
[negative]	[20:10]	<ctw>	"Clinton__: they just say that I need to use the ""'old' i810 driver"" ... I'm definitely using i810, but perhaps there's an older version I need?"
[neutral]	[20:10]	<crdlb>	"and choose ""ati"""
[positive]	[20:10]	<Pacane>	Its worth it..
[neutral]	[20:10]	<vega->	Ashfire908: umm, dunno.. deleting .g* should give you the menus and taskbar as they are after a fresh install
[neutral]	[20:10]	<webpirate>	BUT....

[negative]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	the fglrxinfo : gdirect rendering: No (If you want to find out why, try setting LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose)
[neutral]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	    GLX_ATI_pixel_format_float, GLX_ATI_render_texture
[neutral]	[20:10]	<Pacane>	Much easier with drivers and stuff
[negative]	[20:10]	<We3Share>	crdlb: Ok, got it...

[positive]	[20:10]	<Pacane>	;)
[positive]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	:P
[neutral]	[20:10]	<Ashfire908>	vega-: where do i run that command?
[neutral]	[20:10]	<lamego>	bananamuzzj, have you installed the ati driver from the ubuntu repositories ?
[negative]	[20:10]	<webpirate>	I could not get the restricted drivers to work but ENVY managed to sort things out for me
[neutral]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	Yes, but i didnt need that one
[positive]	[20:10]	<nickrud>	TwoD: and if you still have a black screen, hit ctl-alt-f1 to get to a console again
[negative]	[20:10]	<Davy_Jones>	Clinton__: can i use Synaptic instead?
[negative]	[20:10]	<TwoD>	nickrud, yeah I know that's not gdm, but it says gdm is already running when I try to start it. Will try what you said later (dual-booting)
[neutral]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	i installed the one on the ati site
[negative]	[20:10]	<TwoD>	ah
[negative]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	"because i wanted support for ""ETQW"""
[negative]	[20:10]	<nickrud>	TwoD: then at that point, sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[negative]	[20:10]	<bananamuzzj>	the installation went perfect :/
[negative]	[20:11]	<webpirate>	So you may want to try ENVY if you are having troouble with the restricted drivers in ubuntu
[negative]	[20:11]	<kousotu>	where is xorg.conf? (call me stupid for not writing it down...)
[neutral]	[20:11]	<nickrud>	!envy
[negative]	[20:11]	<ubotu>	envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[negative]	[20:11]	<jakamo>	Who here can tell me  how to change the silly little green man back to an exit door?

[negative]	[20:14]	<DaneM>	Hello, all.  I have an odd problem.  I'm running a Tiger3xx modem (according to lspci), with 2 fxs modules, and 2 fxo modules.  The fxo modules connect to the phone company, and the fxs modules connect to handsets.  The problem is that one of the fxs modules seems to have stopped generating dialtone, and does not receive incoming calls.  As far as I can tell, it's set up the same way as the other one, but when I pick up the handset,

Ubuntu keeps crashing me back to the log in screen whenever I try to run fglrxinfo to troubleshoot my ubuntu vid troubles. How can I figure out what's wrong (I don't see crash report) or does anyone have any suggestions?
[positive]	[20:14]	<Clinton__>	jnc: looks like I'll go to usenet for that :)
[neutral]	[20:14]	<neztit1>	hi

[negative]	[20:15]	<lamego>	Xera, the only way your windows partition can be affected, is, if you have deleted it, and applied the change

[negative]	[20:15]	<Colro>	My oo.org keeps crashing -- I can't open a simple powerpoint ( @HLINK ) and whenever I try to change the general settings on writer it crashes as well. Do I need to reinstall it or something? :x

[negative]	[20:15]	<lamego>	Xera, still, if it was the case, as long you dont touch the disk, it should be easier to recover (in case you really need it)
[negative]	[20:15]	<jnc>	Clinton__: I don't know man, I'd get a mac if I needed to edit video

[neutral]	[20:25]	<bananamuzzj>	i rebooted
[negative]	[20:25]	<erin>	Hi, everyone. I just installed 7.10, but it won't boot! I think it's because my old IDE hard drive showed up as SDA and my SATA drive, on which I installed Ubuntu, is SDB. How do I make the SATA drive SDA so it will boot?
[negative]	[20:25]	<m235>	LjL, I can't make a fake package?
[positive]	[20:25]	<IceflamePhoenix>	evening
[negative]	[20:25]	<rainwalker>	lamego: well some of them are for eyecandy, I see medibuntu in there too, fonts, AWN, Wine, and one or two I don't know

[neutral]	[20:25]	<LjL>	!info equivs | m235
[neutral]	[20:25]	<usser>	m235: that kinda defeats all the purpose of apt-get

[positive]	[20:26]	<erin>	penguin: Fresh install
[neutral]	[20:26]	<rainwalker>	lamego: from /etc/apt/sources.list right?
[positive]	[20:26]	<nickrud>	matthew_: ls /dev will show them all, it's the one not in fdisk I'd guess
[negative]	[20:26]	<usser>	m235: if u gonna do that u might as well download the .deb manually and do dpkg --force all on it

[negative]	[20:26]	<Mith36>	No luck wirechief.  Anyone else have any idea why fglrxinfo would crash me?
[negative]	[20:26]	<penguin42>	erin: Do you have the livecd to see what the discs look like and where it has actually got installed?
[negative]	[20:26]	<m235>	usser, i'll try that first

[negative]	[20:28]	<lgc__>	nickrud, lamego, plik would you spare me the lengthy reading and the corresponding RTFMs? I just want to know how to encrypt a file on my directory and later retrieve it.
[neutral]	[20:29]	<secret901>	escobar5: try Ctrl+Alt+F7

[neutral]	[20:29]	<D3f0>	any laptop recomendation?
[neutral]	[20:29]	<franixe_>	genjutsu: here @HLINK         It should automatically install the correct drivers for you
[positive]	[20:29]	<lamego>	lgc__, I could, if I knew it without RTFM, so, you are basically asking me to RTFM for you ;)
[neutral]	[20:29]	<Clinton__>	D3f0: one that doesn't burn or explode
[negative]	[20:29]	<petru>	hello? how can i make an upgrade install from ubuntu7.04 to 7.10. i have downloaded the 7.10 iso and burned the image already. thanks!
[neutral]	[20:29]	<astro76>	!envy | genjutsu
[negative]	[20:29]	<ubotu>	genjutsu: envy is a script that may leave you envious of those who have not used it, use the resticted manager to install binary drivers or use the instructions on the wiki, this script may break your machine very badly!
[neutral]	[20:29]	<escobar5>	secret901, not working, i just get the black screen and a pointer blinking at the top of the screen, no prompt
[negative]	[20:29]	<noelferreira>	how can i convert my local from utf-8 to iso8859-15?
[negative]	[20:29]	<penguin42>	erin: Is the Error 22 from a GRUB screen or does it get any further? How is your sata drive connected?
[negative]	[20:30]	<nickrud>	IceflamePhoenix: get it from your computer manufacturer. Any linux driver is already in the kernel
[negative]	[20:30]	<sco50000>	can someone please try to help me? i need some help setting up my wireless SMCWPCI-G card in feisty
[positive]	[20:30]	<lgc__>	lamego, OK. Hopefully someone else...;).
[negative]	[20:30]	<ZAKhan>	i have 2 ethernet cards in my pc how can i team them?
[positive]	[20:30]	<secret901>	escobar5: does it always do this or is this the first time?
[negative]	[20:30]	<m235>	ack this is so stupid. My dependency is msp430tools-base-tinyos but i have msp430tools-base installed which is equivalent
[negative]	[20:30]	<nickrud>	IceflamePhoenix: unless you have an ralink, I hear
[positive]	[20:30]	<Hristo>	picard_pwns_kirk, i want it to work but without the capitalisation on letters :)
[negative]	[20:30]	<penguin42>	ZAKhan: There is a thing called 'bonding' if your switch supports it
[neutral]	[20:30]	<escobar5>	secret901, just since i upgraded to gusty
[neutral]	[20:30]	<secret901>	escobar5: try Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to restart the x server
[negative]	[20:30]	<rainwalker>	kind of a stupid question, but when commenting, does it matter if one # is used versus two?
[neutral]	[20:30]	<IceflamePhoenix>	nickrud - i have ralink, are they different?
[positive]	[20:30]	<lamego>	lgc__, anyway, google is much more efficient thant I am: @HLINK
[negative]	[20:30]	<picard_pwns_kirk>	Hristo: so you want to remap it?
[negative]	[20:30]	<nownott>	i just installed ubuntu i can ssh into the box but i cant get on the internt
[neutral]	[20:30]	<erin>	penguin42: Yes, it's after the GRUB screen. The sata drive is internal, connected to the first plugin thing.

[negative]	[20:30]	<lgc__>	lamego, let me check on that...
[negative]	[20:31]	<nickrud>	IceflamePhoenix: riotkittie (not here right now) is intimately familiar with them, because they were a pain.
[negative]	[20:31]	<petru>	hello! how can i make an upgrade install from ubuntu7.04 to 7.10. i have downloaded the 7.10 iso and burned the image already. thanks!

[negative]	[20:31]	<charles>	get this error when i install anything, E: ggzd: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 134, is that a problem?
[positive]	[20:31]	<penguin42>	erin: OK, so boot back into grub and you should be able to get a command line and grub has an autocomplete feature where you hit tab; so type   boot ( and  try and tab complete and see what discs you see - make sure Grub can see it

[positive]	[20:32]	<ubotu>	thndrempr: Don't ask to ask a question. Just ask your question :)

[negative]	[20:37]	<lgc__>	plik, lamego I'm afraid it's too complicated for what I'm looking. How would I encrypt a string or a file without resorting to generating public and private keys and all that fuss? What's the function that encrypts passwords?
[negative]	[20:37]	<karel>	I'm confused about which drivers all exist for ati (x1400 in my case) cards exists and if any of them standard work with compiz etc. Can somebody sum them up for me? thanks
[negative]	[20:37]	<Shadoslayer>	Hey folks, I'm having a bit of a problem and hoping you can help me out. I was running ubuntu 6.06 which installed fine, but with v7.04 (haven't tried 7.10 yet) it boots up fine, gets me into xorg but my screen is all garbled up. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
[negative]	[20:37]	<Clinton__>	hasafraker: that will then give you root access, now you need to make sure that your / is mounted
[negative]	[20:37]	<nickrud>	arooni: a good idea to disable all 3d party repos during an upgrade
[negative]	[20:37]	<thndrempr>	@genjusu i have to press f6 and then use -noapic rite?
[negative]	[20:37]	<yooper08>	nope didn' work
[positive]	[20:37]	<genjutsu>	thndrempr: i also had difficulties installing it as it is. the noapic parameter should do the trick
[neutral]	[20:37]	<astronouth7303>	lgc__: do you need a reversable encryption?

[neutral]	[20:37]	<lgc__>	astronouth7303, yes.
[neutral]	[20:37]	<lamego>	lgc__, passwords can't be decrypted
[negative]	[20:37]	<Ashfire908>	secret901: yep. no window borders. effects were working before...
[negative]	[20:37]	<skriv>	what is the default root password
[neutral]	[20:38]	<hasafraker>	took almost 4hrs to install it
[neutral]	[20:38]	<lgc__>	lamego, right.
[neutral]	[20:38]	<astro76>	Shadoslayer, I'd try 7.10 before troubleshooting 7.04
[neutral]	[20:38]	<hasafraker>	only PII
[negative]	[20:38]	<lamego>	lgc__, you want a reversible encryption, right ?
[neutral]	[20:38]	<Ashfire908>	skriv, null
[negative]	[20:38]	<Hristo>	Hello, does someone know how to remap Caps lock to something like - send Caps Lock but set Caps Lock state off (so caps lock is always off)?
[positive]	[20:38]	<thndrempr>	@genjusu but will it disable any features like wireless support??
[negative]	[20:38]	<secret901>	Ashfire908: the problem I had was when I enabled desktop effects, the minimize buttons and close buttons disappear
[positive]	[20:38]	<nickrud>	roadfish: not really ;) The simplest is to disable the repo you want to remove all traces of, update your sources, then look at obsolete in synaptic. Those are from the now unknown source
[positive]	[20:38]	<Shadoslayer>	astro: I know, I just hate to waste another CD if this issue hasn't been fixed :)
[negative]	[20:38]	<astronouth7303>	lgc__: in a lot of software, the passwords are just hashed. to compare them, one hashes the attempt and compare the hashes
[neutral]	[20:38]	<secret901>	Ashfire908: I fixed it by reinstalling compiz
[negative]	[20:38]	<lgc__>	"lamego, only checked against the output of ""crypt"" or whatever."
[neutral]	[20:38]	<skriv>	doesnt work

[neutral]	[20:38]	<skriv>	gotcha
[negative]	[20:38]	<Scott0>	@HLINK <--- why would this be happeneing?
[negative]	[20:38]	<kbrooks>	r0b-, wrong
[positive]	[20:39]	<skriv>	so no root account exists....like a traditional nix?
[neutral]	[20:39]	<secret901>	Ashfire908: sudo apt-get install compiz
[positive]	[20:39]	<lamego>	lgc__, you can use md5 :)
[neutral]	[20:39]	<Tarkus_>	whats more popular, and comes standard with most commonly used distros? gnome/gtk or kde/qt?
[positive]	[20:39]	<astro76>	Shadoslayer, I feel my time is worth more than 25 cents ;)
[negative]	[20:39]	<genjutsu>	thndrempr: yep... the only thing thats not running out of the box is the wireless lan.   You have to configure its driver to make it work in ubuntu
[negative]	[20:39]	<Mith36>	hristo:I doubt this is what you want, but if you run  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg there is a dialog box that pops up about halfway through that tells you how to do that during the keyboard set up
[neutral]	[20:39]	<r0b->	its seeing my Athlon X2 4200+ wrong
[positive]	[20:39]	<lgc__>	"astronouth7303, I've always been confused by the meaning of ""hash""."
[positive]	[20:39]	<Clinton__>	skriv: there is a root account but it has an unknown scrambled password
[positive]	[20:39]	<plik>	or rot13 !!  ;)
[neutral]	[20:39]	<lamego>	md5 is commonly used for password matching
[negative]	[20:39]	<nickrud>	skriv: the account exists, but has no password to log in with
[negative]	[20:39]	<astro76>	Clinton__, baloney, there is no password
[neutral]	[20:39]	<Shadoslayer>	astro: good point. Anyway, I'm downloading 7.10 now so I'll give it a whirl.
[positive]	[20:39]	<lamego>	plik, rot13 vs md5 :P ?
[neutral]	[20:39]	<skriv>	thanks guys
[positive]	[20:39]	<Hristo>	Mith36, thank you, i'll try :)
[negative]	[20:39]	<Clinton__>	astro76: scrambled or no password, still can't login
[negative]	[20:39]	<Mith36>	well, you can reroute it to ctrl instead of caps.
[neutral]	[20:39]	<neco_77>	hi
[negative]	[20:39]	<astro76>	Clinton__, if there is no password set, it is disabled
[neutral]	[20:39]	<astronouth7303>	"lgc__: basically, it's a ""summary"" of data, for quick comparison. Usually MD5 or SHA"
[neutral]	[20:39]	<nickrud>	or a password that cannot be typed, more accurately
[negative]	[20:39]	<astro76>	Clinton__, no need to make up stuff though

[negative]	[20:41]	<secret901>	Ashfire908: what does it say when you try sudo apt-get install compiz?
[neutral]	[20:41]	<penguin42>	wirechief: Go to System->administration->Screen and Graphics
[positive]	[20:41]	<astronouth7303>	lgc__: the perl data structure known has hashes (aka dicts or mappings in other languages) are called that because a hash tree is used, most likely
[negative]	[20:42]	<thndrempr>	@genjusu because i want to know abt wireless lan before i install ubuntu
[neutral]	[20:42]	<penguin42>	Judgegeo: You don't set any mount point for swap, and the main one is /
[positive]	[20:42]	<wirechief>	penguin42: thanks
[negative]	[20:42]	<nickrud>	Judgegeo: the 20 at /  , swap has no mount point

[neutral]	[20:43]	<athem>	is there a way to make ubuntu 7.10 power off my computer once it is done shutting down?
[positive]	[20:43]	<lamego>	rainwalker, the problem, is that I told you about 100 times to comment 3rd party repositories :)
[neutral]	[20:43]	<nickrud>	rainwalker: disable the medibuntu repos during your upgrade, along with any other 3d party repos. They're probably getting hammered
[negative]	[20:43]	<Ashfire908>	secret901:  i can reinstall it myself
[negative]	[20:43]	<nownott>	ok well when i do ping www.google.com i get ping: unknown host www.google.com

[positive]	[20:44]	<bruenig>	GTroy, distro upgrades in discrete release distros are known to be problematic, fresh install is a hassle, your choice
[negative]	[20:44]	<nalioth>	spore: there is no need to patch your router as long as you connect to port 8001. (half the time, the router patch doesn't work anyway)
[positive]	[20:44]	<BoomSie>	distro-upgrade: you transport your sh*t over to the next, with the risk also taking bad things with it. Clean install is faster in the end (faster in the way of ... performance)
[negative]	[20:44]	<Andycasss>	I need some guidance - I am trying to set a command repeat when the destination address is not reachable. With a delay of 5 min
[positive]	[20:44]	<lamego>	Ashfire908, you should look for the complains on upgrades :)
[negative]	[20:44]	<Ashfire908>	secret901: what do you think i'm doing

[negative]	[20:46]	<crdlb>	Scott0, then it should turn on when you use the restricted driver

[positive]	[20:46]	<astronouth7303>	Ditters: shut up and be patient. It means the evolution doesn't like you

[positive]	[20:47]	<partymetroid>	I recently installed Xubuntu 7.10 RC onto the years-old eMachine that my sister gave me after she got a new laptop.  I ran it off of the LiveCD without problems (it ran even faster than Windows XP did), and it installed just fine.  I can even access the ext3 filesystem, and read/write files to it.
[negative]	[20:47]	<Ditters>	astronouth7303 (formaly known as astro76) ... I guess you are right.

[neutral]	[20:48]	<astro76>	Ditters, you are still neglecting the fact that you are trying to use an .evolution/ from 7.10 in 7.04
[neutral]	[20:48]	<Ditters>	not anymore
[negative]	[20:48]	<bruenig>	Scott0, looks like you have some artifact problems

[negative]	[20:49]	<Clinton__>	Eyal_D: they should be on by default if your video card is supported out of the box

[negative]	[20:49]	<sha1sum>	hey guys... is there anyone that would know how to switch to portrait resolutions?  I'm inside a vmware workstation, dunno if that matters... I added the modeline 1024x1280 to xorg.conf, but didn't seem to take

[negative]	[20:50]	<Ax-Ax>	What shall I do to get my Soundblaster Live! 5.1 Dell oem to work with recording? Is there anything I can do? If i try recording with Audacity it just says: Error while opening sound device. Please check the input device settings and the project sample rate.

[negative]	[20:50]	<Scott0>	so how would i fix a bad xorg then?
[negative]	[20:50]	<penguin42>	partymetroid: The initrd on your hard disc is built for your machine based on your hardware; so you can have problems with either the installer not putting stuff it needs in there or other screw ups during install meaning it can't get to the initrd
[neutral]	[20:50]	<Ashfire908>	"nownott: type ""echo dnsserverip1 > /etc/resolv.conf"" then ""echo dnsserverip2 >> /etc/resolv.conf"

[neutral]	[20:52]	<tweakedInferno>	what codecs are needed to play avi files on ubuntu with sound?
[negative]	[20:52]	<GTroy>	scott you might try a $dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[neutral]	[20:52]	<penguin42>	[chr0n0s]: Try install the debhelpers package
[negative]	[20:52]	<Scott0>	how am i expected to know how to configure it manually
[neutral]	[20:52]	<GTroy>	but back up everything first
[negative]	[20:52]	<bruenig>	tweakedInferno, avi is a container, so that question depends on what exactly it is containing
[negative]	[20:52]	<partymetroid>	penguin42: Are you suggesting that something went wrong in that particular installation?  If so, do you recommend reinstalling?  If you do, then I would say that I have reinstalled like, 4 times...
[negative]	[20:52]	<genjutsu>	@thndrempr but if you are running on ntfs, your hard drive would be read only for ubuntu
[neutral]	[20:52]	<astro76>	tweakedInferno, you'll need w32codecs from medibuntu

[neutral]	[22:09]	<penguin42>	axisys: rsync
[negative]	[22:09]	<erin>	penguin42: Hmm... Well, I'll change those hd1 lines first
[neutral]	[22:10]	<axisys_>	penguin42: about 30G?
[negative]	[22:10]	<comicinker>	Dumptruck: should work out of the box. what system are you using?
[neutral]	[22:10]	<axisys_>	penguin42: does rsync offer threading ?
[negative]	[22:10]	<DanMulvey>	WHen I shut down my laptop, it doesn't turn completely off...is there a reason why?
[negative]	[22:10]	<rohan>	ubuntu_: hmm ? strange
[negative]	[22:10]	<DG19075>	I guess there's not much i can do to get the Ubuntu Studio window borders back to where thry were under 7.04 then...
[neutral]	[22:10]	<Dumptruck>	7.04
[positive]	[22:10]	<Phil>	Dumptruck: should be able to just work depending on your fstab
[negative]	[22:10]	<penguin42>	axisys_: Yeh should be OK, no rsync doesn't do threading - might take a while
[negative]	[22:10]	<rohan>	DG19075: no, atleast not automatically
[positive]	[22:10]	<DUUUUUDE>	i uninstalled an application, but the short cut is still in Applications menu
[neutral]	[22:10]	<Dumptruck>	and have NTFS-3g installed
[neutral]	[22:10]	<KanGar>	where can i get help on /dev/usblp0?

[neutral]	[22:10]	<Phil>	anyone know what user/group samba runs as?
[negative]	[22:10]	<slackern>	satorious: i don't have an audigy card myself so not too familiar with them, it should be at the bottom where you select device, and which mixer tracks should be used for that device, maybe something special with those cards that im not to sure about =/
[neutral]	[22:10]	<rohan>	DanMulvey: yes, does your laptop support ACPI ?
[neutral]	[22:10]	<comicinker>	Dumptruck: get the ntfs-3g packet
[neutral]	[22:11]	<axisys_>	penguin42: so it should be faster than netcat or star .. i think star offers threading
[negative]	[22:11]	<ubuntu_>	rohan: right, any way I can see the shutdonw logs to see if I can find the problem?
[neutral]	[22:11]	<rohan>	ubuntu_: not now, because you used the livecd
[negative]	[22:11]	<peepsalot>	penguin42, hey, i restarted, i was having trouble getting into my desktop (without failsafe gnome).  which dot files should I get rid of?  should i rm -rf .gnome .gnome2 .gnome_private ?
[positive]	[22:11]	<comicinker>	help: kdenlive doesn't recognise 16:9 dv movies, they are displayed as 4:3. but totem shows them as 16:9, what could be the problem in kdenlive?
[positive]	[22:11]	<penguin42>	axisys: Netcat by itself just does the connection; 30GB isn't that much these days :-)
[negative]	[22:11]	<speaker219>	Is there any way to control the brightness via Xorg (like gamma tweaking etc) Like a gamma control panel would work on windows?
[neutral]	[22:11]	<ubuntu_>	rohan: anyway I can fix my Previous GRUB from the live cd
[negative]	[22:11]	<ff29>	"penguin42: i just got an error the box says boot loader and the message is ""/casper/vmlinuz"
[neutral]	[22:11]	<Dumptruck>	get the ntfs-3g packet - already done
[negative]	[22:12]	<penguin42>	peepsalot: Yeh I'd go for all of those - but instead of rm'ing them move them into another directory in case you want bits of them
[positive]	[22:12]	<Dumptruck>	still same error message
[negative]	[22:12]	<speaker219>	Is there any way to control the brightness via Xorg (like gamma tweaking etc) Like a gamma control panel would work on windows?
[positive]	[22:12]	<DUUUUUDE>	i uninstalled an application, but the shortcut is still in Applications menu

[negative]	[22:12]	<rohan>	ubuntu_: well, why don't you just start the install overagain ?
[negative]	[22:12]	<blix_>	How do I get involved in Ubuntu development?
[negative]	[22:12]	<DUUUUUDE>	how do i delete the shortcut?
[negative]	[22:12]	<pike_>	speaker219: you can just xgamma -gamma .4 or whatever 1 is current
[negative]	[22:12]	<DanMulvey>	rohan: how do i find that out?
[neutral]	[22:12]	<comicinker>	Dumptruck: and install a configuration tool for ntfs-3g
[negative]	[22:12]	<ubuntu_>	rohan: I've done that like 3 times already :'(
[neutral]	[22:12]	<blix_>	like what languages is Ubuntu written in?
[negative]	[22:12]	<erin>	penguin42: I made the changes, but I don't understand that stuff about map and all that. By the way, I made a backupcopy of the original and new version of this.
[neutral]	[22:12]	<blix_>	C++?
[negative]	[22:13]	<Sp0tUb>	How do i get my intergrated webcam to work in Ubuntu?
[neutral]	[22:13]	<Dumptruck>	comicinker - hmmm not sure
[neutral]	[22:13]	<franixe_>	blix_ : Russian
[negative]	[22:13]	<axisys_>	slaytanic: nfs would be faster than netcat or star ? i want something that offers threading maybe or multiple chnl from data transfer
[positive]	[22:13]	<ubuntu_>	rohan: each time it advances further into the instalation before shutting down
[neutral]	[22:13]	<blix_>	Russia?
[negative]	[22:13]	<penguin42>	erin: I think it is trying to do something clever to swap the discs around before it boots Windows - but I'm wondering if that is what is confusing it in the first place; but I suspect not
[neutral]	[22:13]	<comicinker>	Dumptruck: sudo apt-get install ntfs-config
[neutral]	[22:13]	<blix_>	mmm
[neutral]	[22:13]	<slaytanic>	axisys_: Well, it's pretty fast. 30gb ain't that much data anyways.
[negative]	[22:13]	<bruenig>	blix_, ubuntu is simply a collection of other software, it has a few homemade python scripts incorporated but that's it, it doesn't develop, it packages other development
[negative]	[22:13]	<speaker219>	Pike_ i don't really mean gamma, on windows there was a way to control the brightness, but i think it was doing something else, e.g. it was not done via the graphics card. This is the program i used on windows @HLINK and it runs in wine but i'm looking for an all-linux solution.
[neutral]	[22:13]	<bonna>	ciao a tutti
[neutral]	[22:13]	<blix_>	I'll just read the help pages for now
[negative]	[22:13]	<erin>	penguin42: What would happen if I erased those lines?
[positive]	[22:14]	<void^>	blix_: the kernel is mostly C. applications are coded in whatever language the developer fancied at the time.
[neutral]	[22:14]	<slaytanic>	blix_: Lot's of 'em.
[neutral]	[22:14]	<blix_>	right ok thanks bruenig
[neutral]	[22:14]	<justin420>	can anybody help me getting 1680x1050 resolution with dvd-d using a nvidia 6800gs on gutsy?
[neutral]	[22:14]	<erin>	penguin42: Or commented them out
[negative]	[22:14]	<Dumptruck>	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
[neutral]	[22:14]	<Dumptruck>	E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
[positive]	[22:14]	<penguin42>	erin: Not sure - something would be more or less confused :-) But I suspect they are irrelevant to the problem of booting Linux
[neutral]	[22:14]	<blix_>	I'll come back later
[neutral]	[22:14]	<bruenig>	Dumptruck, close synaptic
[neutral]	[22:14]	<speaker219>	Dumptruck: you...yeah

[negative]	[22:14]	<JohnRobert>	I have a laptop running gutsy...it has eth1 (wireless) that I use, but I intend to hook up a PC to eth0 (wired ethernet) to it.... how would I 'join' the pc to my wireless network via the laptop - what should I be looking for, and would it be possible to do this without turning off/ruining network manager?
[neutral]	[22:14]	<Dumptruck>	oops
[negative]	[22:14]	<blix_>	actually no I don;t
[negative]	[22:14]	<speaker219>	So any solution to the brightness problem?
[negative]	[22:14]	<comicinker>	yeah
[negative]	[22:14]	<Dumptruck>	actually I already have it
[negative]	[22:14]	<DrVali>	Ive got an atheros 5006eg card that does not work under ubuntu 7.10.  I'm running the amd64 version.  Anyone know if this card can be made to work - and if so - do you have a link to a page that I can read?
[negative]	[22:14]	<erin>	penguin42: So, how about I comment them out and reboot it?
[negative]	[22:14]	<peepsalot>	penguin42, any other things I should move?
[neutral]	[22:14]	<penguin42>	speaker219: I think it really is gamma you want
[neutral]	[22:14]	<axisys_>	slaytanic: well i like to see which one get me faster datat transfer..
[negative]	[22:15]	<speaker219>	It's not. trust me.
[neutral]	[22:15]	<slaytanic>	axisys_: Do a benchmark, then.
[negative]	[22:15]	<penguin42>	peepsalot: See if those work, if they don't then try .gconf and .gconfd
[negative]	[22:15]	<peepsalot>	ok

[negative]	[22:15]	<comicinker>	Dumptruck: so there must be a configuration tool in your menu- look for it and if you cant find it, enable it by editing the menu
[neutral]	[22:15]	<tomd123>	Can anyone help me getting my Custom Function buttons working on my sony laptop, I'm running 7.10

[negative]	[22:15]	<axisys_>	slaytanic: yep.. but dont u think if i could have multiple channels that will make the transfer faster?

[negative]	[22:16]	<ubotu>	If you're having problems with sound, first ensure ALSA is selected, by double clicking on the volume control, then File -> Change Device (ALSA Mixer). If that fails, see @HLINK - @HLINK - @HLINK - For playing audio files, see !Players and !MP3

[neutral]	[22:54]	<radge>	its just a crippled ubuntu
[neutral]	[22:54]	<PhilAirtime>	jrattner1: the DVD contains more packages, so less downloading needed. However, that's negated by the fact that you have to download a huge DVD ISO.
[neutral]	[22:54]	<radge>	lol
[neutral]	[22:54]	<kousotu>	I did as it says
[negative]	[22:54]	<GRocket>	My understanding is that when installing Ubuntu, the username and password I entered would give me administrator rights from another user desktop. But it does not accept my password. Do I need to login as root, and how do I do that?

[negative]	[22:54]	<kousotu>	you'll have to hunt for it
[negative]	[22:54]	<stiv2k>	kale: what was the last thing you said

[positive]	[22:54]	<jrattner1>	PhilAirtime, thank you
[negative]	[22:54]	<pike_>	dasiala: well if its still there after the upgrade youre fine then you just need to chown -R $USER:$USER /home/whatever and then gksu gedit /etc/passwd and make sure your home dir is right there
[negative]	[22:54]	<kale>	stiv2k: lsof, it might reveal something

[neutral]	[23:06]	<cheetahfoot>	but it's enough to be not good.
[neutral]	[23:06]	<pike_>	aguitel: not a firewall issue though do 'sudo iptables -L' to check itll just say all ACCEPT
[negative]	[23:06]	<saloxin>	comicinker: the bash syntax seems sane. so the problem might be in the othre end of the symlink sh
[negative]	[23:06]	<navaburo>	kkathman, look around in the keybindings for compiz-manager (or ask in #ubuntu-effects)
